It says a lot when even the dog wants her.

_"She can't help it if she's made that way  
She's not to blame if they look her way  
She ain't really tryin' to cause a scene  
It just comes naturally  
Aw, the girl can't help it."_

— **Mel McDaniel**, "Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On"

This woman is sex on legs, and everything about her screams _Boioioioioioing_! She may or may not know it, but when she walks past, others take leave of their senses and devolve into a steaming mass of drool, totally consumed by lust.

In a funny cartoon, expect steam to shoot from their ears, their hearts beating so hard you can _see_ them. For other shows, the leads will stutter and sweat; any charm they once had will dissolve in her presence. We'll also probably hear at least one Wolf Whistle.

She may be a sympathetic character, who is tired of being treated differently because of her appearance. She could be a ball-buster who uses her skills to seduce her way to whatever she wants. She might be smart as a whip or dumb as a post. Either way, she will probably only be a Flat Character.

Of course, the only person she wouldn't mind drooling over her will most likely be a Chaste Hero.

Compare with Ms. Fanservice, who's meant to provoke the same reactions in the audience, rather than other characters. (There's considerable overlap, though.) See Chick Magnet and Even the Guys Want Him for the male version. Make straight females fall for her as hard as the straight boys, and she'll be a case of Even the Girls Want Her. A good portion of these characters are blonde and if so, may also be an example of Everyone Loves Blondes.

Closely related to and often overlaps with Lust Object. Or for the chaster version, you have World's Most Beautiful Woman. Also compare to Eating the Eye Candy. Contrasts with Girl Next Door.

## In-Universe Examples Only:

    Advertising 

-   The Cadbury's Caramel Bunny ads back during the 1980s pretty much involved every single male animal fawning over her whilst she promoted chocolate. Adding to that, in a 2009 UK-based poll she was even voted the 3rd sexiest cartoon character of all time, just behind Betty Boop and Jessica Rabbit.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the manga/anime _Dragon Ball_, during the 21st World Tournament, the third match pits a woman named Ran Fan against a tall monk-like fellow in a turban named Namu. Ran Fan isn't a terrible fighter, but Namu is just that much better, and one of the cards that she plays to try to throw him off his guard is to seduce him in the middle of the fight by putting on an act and taking off... A couple articles of clothing. Namu's solution? He closes his eyes.
    -   This joke was repeated in _Dragon Ball Super_ during the Tournament of Power arc. In it, Caway, a fighter from Universe 4, attempts to seduce Master Roshi when they fight. However, Roshi begins to imply that he wants to sexually assault her as soon as she tries this, resulting in Caway becoming so scared that she runs out of the ring and eliminates herself.
-   _The Disastrous Life of Saiki K._ has a variation that focuses more on beauty than on sexiness. Teruhashi isn't the resident Ms. Fanservice (that's Aiura), but she is considered so radiantly beautiful that whenever she walks down the street every man drops what he's doing to stare at her. She also has a following of ardent fans who do her bidding because they're so smitten with her.
-   _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_: Athena and her daughter, Clara, are a pair of superheroines who are portrayed as nubile and scantily clad. Hardly anyone can resist leering at them, be it their enemies, or the public they're constantly putting themselves at risk to protect. It's the reason Athena eventually retired, because she couldn't bear the constant sexual harassment; especially since some weren't content to just _look_....
-   _Dorothy of Oz_: Selluriah's Witch form tends to elicit this reaction from people. Indigo is pretty much the only male in the series to witness it and not melt into a puddle on the floor. Though it's implied that this is only because he's seen it so many times it no longer has a noticeable effect on him.
-   Ran from _Gals!_, although it seems like the guys' reaction to her is partially because of her fiery personality and knowledge of the "gal" subculture. The only guy who _doesn't_ seem to be (immediately) affected by her is Rei, who constantly warns his head-over-heels friend Yuya that "she's trouble." (Although the "trouble" is referring more to her hot temper than her being a Femme Fatale—in fact, she constantly rebuffs guys that want to sleep with her and is a proud virgin.) At one point in the series almost all the guys in Shibuya hold a contest for who gets to have the right to be her boyfriend. She happily claims the one who wins and breaks the hearts of all the other boys.
-   _Ghost Talker's Daydream_: Misaki Saiki is such a sex bomb that only has three guys crushing on her _and_ is the most frequently requested dom at the Roppongi S&M Club, but a magazine editor asked her to offer a pair of _her_ panties as the first place prize for one of their contests!
-   _Girls Bravo_: To say she's only 16, Kirie has got it goin' on:
    -   So much so, that Fukuyama, Kosame, and Hijiri, all want a piece of her. A later episode showed she couldn't even walk down the street without being mobbed by middle-aged men, boys and even kids asking her for dates, much to her chagrin.
    -   The 4th episode takes the trope to literal extremes, when Fukuyama pretends to be sick after eating some of Kirie's bento and guilt trips her into wearing a nurse's costume while she looks after him.
-   _GTO: The Early Years_: Hot Teacher Nao Kadena shamelessly exploits her sex appeal to raise her students' grades, offering them a chance to look and even touch if they score well.
-   Cool Big Sis Dr. Yamaguchi from _Hajime no Ippo_ is a Hello Doctor case. She's a friendly and cheerful young doctor who has her own clinic, and the fact that she often wears _very_ short miniskirts and possesses _huge_ breasts do the rest. Oh, and Yamaguchi's so Married to the Job that she completely _fails_ to notice her effect on Ippo's sempais. Actually, she has that effect on Ippo too.
-   Yayoi Sanzenin, the school nurse in _Happy Lesson_, always has a queue of students waiting outside her office.
-   _Highschool of the Dead_: Shizuka is a literal example, since she was the School Nurse at Fujimi High, and has repeatedly been noted for her sex appeal. Takashi and Hirano have both been aroused by her and Shimada said she had a nice body before attempting to rape her.
-   Nurse Harumi from _Irresponsible Captain Tylor_. The marines in particular seem to worship her like a goddess.
-   Kenta's mother, Fumio, in _Karin_ is the sympathetic variety. Her attractiveness means that she can never hold down a job for fear of sexual harassment, and she is so stressed that it's turning her into a wreck.
-   In _Fairy Tail_ when everyone is recovering from the fight with Hades, Erza sported a sexy nurse outfit and teased the boys with it.
-   _Kill la Kill_:
    -   At the start, most of the characters including Mako really like Ryuko and she gained number of fans from the Academy despite most of them working for Satsuki.
    -   Nonon Jakuzure is also this to an extent. Even in pre-school she had a number of boys who liked her, she has lots of males supporting her when she fights Ryuko and when Nonon's in her Nudist Beach outfit she's the only one aside from Ryuko that Mataro and Guts gawks at.
-   In the beginning of the _K-On!_ manga's next volume, Sawako forces Mio to wear a nurse outfit for fanservice purposes during a recruitment ad the club was planning to run in light of the recent threat of disbandment over their lack of activities. Ritsu came to her rescue shortly afterwards, partially over such an ad having nothing to do with music, but not before she was pushed to tears over the embarrassing incident.
-   _Lupin III_: Fujiko Mine is anime's original Femme Fatale. While it's hardly a secret how _Lupin_ feels about her, he isn't the only one - as her clients, her enemies, businessmen, and even Inspector Zenigata have all wanted to hit it. So have other women. In _The Columbus Files_, Rozaria asked Lupin if they could share her. While she was joking at the time, her attachment to Fujiko implied she may have meant it.
-   _Maken-ki!_
    -   Despite being semi-flatchested, Kodama Himegami is still considered to be one of the hottest students at Tenbi Academy. There's even a fanclub dedicated to her and with good reason: what she lacks 'up top' is more than made up for by her looks, a gracefully petite figure, and her haughty disposition. Plus, she's got a great pair of legs and a rear to match.
    -   Aki is another literal example, being she's the school nurse. In the manga, while she's used to the male students ogling her, it's made her self-conscious.
    -   The later chapters introduce Love Espada, who's a voluptuous blonde with a raging libido and no concerns about modesty. In the short time she's been at Tenbi, she's become the lust object of the student body at large, since she's openly bisexual.
-   _My Dress-Up Darling_: Female lead Marin Kitagawa is a popular and successful model who succeeds at all of her gigs seemingly effortlessly. She looks good in every outfit she tries on and can sweep both genders off their feet when crossdressing. That said, the story examines just how much work it takes to look that good, between the clothing, makeup, and camera work.
-   Yukariko Sternberg of _My-Otome_ had this effect on some men. Since Otomes must abstain from sex or lose their powers, this led to her canceling her contracts and eventually becoming a teacher at Garderobe.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ had Misato visiting Shinji at school once. The beautiful buxom career soldier immediately evoked this reaction from his male classmates.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   "Pirate Empress" Boa Hancock. To date, the only character to be truly immune to her charms is Luffy, due to being an Oblivious to Love Chaste Hero. Other people have had to resort to stabbing or poisoning themselves to even have a _chance_ at being distracted from her weapon-grade (literally) hawtness.
    -   "Iron Mace" Alvida is a lesser example. When she's introduced, she's a complete and utter Gonk who believes herself to be this, but after she ate the Slip-Slip Fruit offscreen, she becomes an example of this trope. Luffy understandably doesn't recognize her at all in their first post-transformation encounter in Logue Town.
-   _Ranma ½_:
    -   Ranma Saotome is a hot Gender Bender. Men who don't know that he's a genderbender ogle at his girl form, those who do know _still_ ogle at his girl form, many ask for a date, some propose marriage, some kidnap him in order to forcefully propose marriage, et cetera. It doesn't hurt that he provides at least 80 percent of the Fanservice for the show either.
    -   Shampoo too tends to have this effect. Even Ranma was smitten by her looks at first... Then the Jusenkyō guide told him that the kiss on the cheek was an oath to chase "her" (he was in female form at the time) to the end of Earth to kill her, and their relationship has never quite recovered even after she found out the truth and fell for him.
-   _Rent-A-Girlfriend_ has this as a Running Gag for main heroine Chizuru. As the top Rental Girlfriend in her business and an aspiring actress, Chizuru's got hundreds of guys (and some girls) staring in awe at her no matter what she wears or what she's doing.
-   _Rosario + Vampire_: All the guys constantly lust after the beautiful Moka Akashiya and the succubus Kurumu (or, more rather, her big breasts). Too bad they're in love with someone else.
-   Rouge the Bat of _Sonic X_ at points has guys drooling over her and isn't beneath using her sexiness to get her way.
-   _To Love Ru_:
    -   Mikado-sensei. A fan of stockings that uses her charm with the perverted principal and to mess with Rito. It doesn't help that some of her machines require one to be naked.
    -   Even more so with Sephie Michaela Deviluke (Lala, Nana, and Momo's mother) who is a Charmian. Her race's natural beauty causes anyone who sees her uncovered face to ruthlessly lust after her.
-   Sakura in _Urusei Yatsura_, the Miko and resident School Nurse, object of lust for the male students of Tomobiki High School, especially Ataru. When she arrive at Tomobiki High practically every male student gathers outside the gates to greet her in this way.
-   _Usagi-chan de Cue!!_: New student Nekoi Koshka comes to visit Mimika in her homeroom. She's brought a corps of drooling boys with her, and shuts the door in front of them. The boys continue to drool at Koshka through the window. During the Cultural Festival's beauty pageant, Koshka garners the most spirited cheers and hoots as she slinks around on stage.
-   Asuka Tenjouin of _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_, which she has _never_ been happy about. (In fact, in the manga, she almost had to be _dragged_ to the beauty pagent that she had been nominated for.)
-   Shizuka from _Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead_ is pretty enough that Akira freezes in his tracks when he sees her while staring at her breasts and butt thanks to her skimpy athletic wear. Anyone who sees her notes how pretty she is, and the only reason Kencho hasn't started flirting with her is because he knows that his Best Friend Akira is interested too.

    Comic Books 

-   _Asterix_ has Panacaea. When he first notices her, Obelix can't take his eyes off her, causing him to run into a tree. Asterix fares a lot better, but he's not completely immune to Panacaea's charms either, and can be seen watching her appreciatively when she walks by.
-   Blacksad is considered quite the Hunky Hardboiled Detective in-universe. While walking through the hall of a university to visit an old friend teaching there, all the women he passes are giving him admiring looks, to the jealousy and anger of many of their boyfriends.
-   _The DCU_:
    -   Power Girl fills (and overfills) this role. Rarely a man can ignore her big boobs.
    -   Starfire. For example, in _Gotham Central_, when Starfire comes to the GCPD to help clear up some issues with Robin (A body has been found in his outfit, but the police are unsure if it is authentic or a costume) every man stares at her slack-jawed, eliciting a disgusted "men" from Detective Romy Chandler. However, Detective Joely Bartlett smirks and points to the two gay women in the department who are also staring with the exact same expression, just as unable to control themselves as the men. Man or woman, if somebody is that attractive and fits your orientation, it is bringing something out of you.
    -   _Batman_:
        -   Poison Ivy is perhaps the biggest one here, as one of her actual abilities is to secrete pheromones that make everyone around her feel this way.
        -   Catwoman would perhaps also apply, as whilst being Batman's love interest at the same time, The Riddler once described even Ivy as _having a thing for her_.
    -   Dream Girl from _Legion of Super-Heroes_. With her stunning pinup-girl looks and figure, a flirty swimsuit-like costume and boldly confident personality, the male Legionnaires completely stopped noticing the other female members on the team and the female Legionnaires soon grew jealous and resentful.
-   In the _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_, Daisy Duck is treated as such, using her charm and good looks either to have some advantage for herself or to control Donald Duck's temper (the latter method is the most used one, though).
-   _Marvel Universe_:
    -   _X-Men_:
        -   Emma Frost sometimes seems as if her every action, word, movement and gesture is intended to elicit a certain reaction from the men around her. Then they changed her.
        -   Jean Grey tends to have this effect on male characters, to the point that the only one of the original X-Men who didn't fall in love with her has recently been revealed as gay. Even _Emma Frost_ notes it in _All-New X-Men_, observing that Teen Jean won't 'be the fresh-faced redhead who turns every man's head forever'. Jean's reputation is interesting in that for a long time she was a beneficiary of the Smurfette Principle. All of the guys fell over themselves for her simply because she was the _only_ woman on the team _to_ fight over. This didn't really start to change until the introduction of characters such as Storm and Psylocke (the former introduced as an Innocent Fanservice Girl with no taboo against nudity, the latter after her body swap into the sex-on-legs ninja in a Thong of Shielding), and nowadays Jean is most famous for the Love Triangle with Cyclops and Wolverine, rather than for turning _everyone's_ heads.
    -   _Spider-Man_: Mary Jane Watson. "Face it Tiger, you just hit the jackpot!" You sure did, Mr. Parker. You sure did. Black Cat matches her in this.
    -   Jessica Drew alias Spider-Woman (or better, the skrull Queen Veranke posed as her) gets this reaction from Spider-Man and Luke Cage ("Damn, girl!") when she appears in her sexy red and yellow costume in New Avengers. Also, like Poison Ivy above, her arachnid metabolism produces pheromones that emphasize this effect.
    -   _Daredevil_: Issue #25 has Elektra break into the prison Matt is being held in. The male inmates are _very_ vocal about how much they find her attractive.
-   _Archie Comics_:
    -   Often with Veronica and Cheryl Blossom when they are in bikini (especially in the covers for Veronica) or in other skimpy outfits. Betty usually only does if and when she dresses up for an occasion to one-up Ronnie.
    -   Betty and Veronica themselves are not immune when see an handsome boy.
    -   For Melody of _Josie And The Pussy Cats_, the Running Gag is that she causes this reaction wherever she goes, and is too naive/dumb to notice.
-   Elizabeth Chandra (who later drops her first name) from J. Michael Straczynski's _Rising Stars_ had the power to be the most attractive girl possible to any man—later, when her power increases, it even works on women too.
    -   The real tragedy of her power was that with the exception of something like a few others from the Specials, no one ever saw _her_. They just saw "the most beautiful woman on Earth". It's like looking at a tree, and just seeing the tree, not the branches, leaves, and texture of the bark that make it up. She and the guy who had the supposed invulnerability had been Blessed with Suck.
-   _The Spirit_: P'Gell. The first story featuring her had her warning its readers on the first page (spread out over a couch in a jaw-dropping red dress) that "this is _not_ a story for little boys!"
-   Yayita causes this reaction in _Condorito_, although most young women in the setting are as Beautiful as she is.
-   Eva Kant from _Diabolik_ tends to get this reaction from people who aren't aware of her enormous rap sheet (those who are instead tend to _run like hell_). Even her disguises tend to be stunningly beautiful, to the point a would-be rapist upon seeing her in a disguise fed her a mind-altering drug to make her more compliant (it worked so well she actually removed her disguise, making him realize he'd soon be brutally murdered by either her after the drug wore off or by Diabolik himself depending on which one got him first).

    Comic Strips 

-   Miss Buxley from _Beetle Bailey_.
-   Stupefyin' Jones from _Li'l Abner_—also see Theater for the musical.

    Fan Works 

-   _Persona 4 SILVER BLUE_: Like their canon counterparts, both Labrys and Yukiko are this. It's somewhat less visible for Yukiko since she's been around longer at Yasogami, but when Labrys first shows up at school in her "Yura Narukami" guise, it's heavily implied that about 90% of the boys (and even some girls) can't help but stare at her when they first see her, to which Labrys is of course completely oblivious. Chie even jokes that she wouldn't be surprised to see a "Narukami" challenge pop up for Labrys in a similar vein to Yukiko's "Amagi challenge" in the future.
-   In the _Twilight_ fanfic _Luminosity_, there’s a vampire whose power is beauty: literally. Everyone who sees her, even other women, even other _vampires_, are so stunned by her beauty that they will mindlessly follow her around until her self-esteem is high enough that her beauty level drops off to normal. Though, since she’s a vampire, her “normal” is still on a head-turning level, just without accompanying magical compulsion.
-   _Child of the Storm_:
    -   Carol Danvers, who's about 15 when the story starts, but can pass for someone in their early 20s. She hates it, because of the attendant sexual harassment. This contributes to her somewhat spiky disposition and until she meets Harry, her only two male friends are her surrogate big brother Lex Luthor, whose response tends towards Disproportionate Retribution (which has been known to backfire), and Jean-Paul, who's _very_ Camp Gay (and much, much more dangerous than he appears to be). She almost instantly takes to Harry because (aside from a shared love of flying), he sees her as a person first and understands better than most what it's like to be judged on appearance alone.
    -   Jean Grey is also this, with even other girls commenting on how ludicrously gorgeous she is, with Lex later wryly commenting in the sequel that "Jean turns heads fast enough that people get whiplash." Clark, being a little naive, assumes that she looks like his long-time crush Lana Lang. Lex, trying to put it delicately, explains that Lana is "the slim kind of pretty", while Jean is a different kind of pretty.
        
        _"Please, Clark, don't make me resort to spelling it out. Or, worse, hand gestures."_
        
-   In _Origin Story_, Francisco and Sanchez recognize that Alex Harris is sex on two legs even when she's in badly fitting clothing, her hair is a wreck, she's covered in grime, and barefoot.
-   In _Advice and Trust_, Asuka used to evoke this reaction from Shinji's male schoolmates. During a talk Shinji mentions that she was the "miss incredibly-hot-exotic-foreign-transfer-student", and she had packs of boys drooling after her.
-   _Thousand Shinji_, Asuka is _very_ popular among her male schoolmates. According Shinji, "If \[she\] flashed the class, I bet \[she\] could kill half the male population".
-   In _Children of an Elder God_, Asuka had a lot of fans who found her totally hot, although she didn't care for them.
    
    Kensuke and Touji were over by them in an instant, followed a few seconds later by a tide of humanity. A rather small tide, but it was disconcerting nonetheless. Asuka smiled and waved and said hello to three dozen people, quickly learning their names. The only really hard part of it was trying to sort out who was shouting what.
    
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide_: While she and Asuka are having a sleepover, Hikari ponders that all their male classmates drool over her best friend.
-   _Last Child of Krypton_: As soon as Asuka started going to Shinji’s school, Shinji’s male classmates became obsessed with her and started following her everywhere.
-   _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Tempest Rewrite_: When Emma becomes Princess Gale Allen of Venus, several men, including Carson Napier and Dan Dare, ask her for a date at once.
-   _The Many Dates of Danny Fenton_: Many of the girls that Danny goes out with seem to have this affect on him:
    -   On his first date, Danny was rather reluctant and didn't really care for how it would go. Then he sees what his date, Kim Possible, looks like. He's immediately in awe of how attractive she is and quickly becomes optimistic.
    -   Perhaps the most blatant example is Felicia Hardy.
    -   Comically, the actually Warner Brothers give this reaction to Jazz Fenton, who naturally freaks out over it.
-   _Once More with Feeling_: Asuka had a pack of male students following her around in the school grounds.
    
    Asuka followed his gaze, smiled, then happily skipped off towards Rei, causing Shinji to shake his head slightly in amusement as 'the hoard' followed her off, more then a few shooting him envious looks.
    
    -   Touji and Kensuke had to admit that it was easy to understand why she drew so many lovestruck or merely lustful stares:
        
        Both young men freely admitted she was hot, that simply wasn't in question. In a school of generally polite, reserved young Japanese girls, she was a living, breathing firestorm, an impression helped along by her red hair that whirled around her like a burning halo as she moved about the school at speed. Add to that her stunning looks and the fact that she publicly had announced –and Shinji had confirmed- that she was an Evangelion pilot…
        
-   In _Ultimate Spider-Woman_, Mary Jane Watson loves being the center of attention at social functions, and relishes the admiration she gets from guys and the jealousy she often gets from other women. Unfortunately, Mary Jane's awful luck finds ways to make her beauty as much of a curse as a benefit. From her boyfriends' parents assuming she's a Gold Digger to directors assuming she's trying to get roles through her beauty rather than her genuine talent, to being the target of sexual harassment and supervillain stalkers who are _extremely_ Not Good with Rejection, Mary Jane's beauty can be as much of a headache as an advantage.

    Films — Animation 

-   Panthy from _El Arca_, a very busty, very curvy, Panther babe who is introduced in much the same way that Jessica Rabbit is and whose role in the story consists of seducing the Idiot Hero, so that the villain can take over. Oh, and she is seen during the end musical number, dancing in a cage.
-   Iaia the cookie seller from _The Three Caballeros_ makes Donald Duck and José weak at the knees. They spend their trip to Bahia competing with each other (and a large crowd of men that show up) for her affections. In fact, about half the movie has Donald chasing after some Latin lady.
-   From _Toy Story 2_, Buzz Lightyear and the gang are in Al's Toy Barn, where they stumble upon Tour Guide Barbie. Mr. Potato Head immediately begins chanting that he is a "married spud", while Hamm tells him to step aside for the single fellas.
    -   Again in _Toy Story 3_, when Ken meets Molly's Barbie doll for the first time, accompanied by Gary Wright's "Dream Weaver".
-   Georgette the literal Rich Bitch from _Oliver & Company_ is this to the canine world. Just a small appearance on her balcony gets all the dogs in the neighborhood flocking to admire her.
-   Sasha La Fleur from _All Dogs Go to Heaven 2_ is also this trope to canines as evidenced during her debut song "Count Me Out." Her appearance alone causes every male dog in the bar to fall head over heels for her.
-   Lola Bunny from _Space Jam_ enters Schlesinger's Gym to a Sexophone riff, and gets all the Looney Tunes to start Eating the Eye Candy. Her Impossible Hourglass Figure has Bugs Bunny especially smitten, to the point of making a fool of himself. Even Foghorn Leghorn rubs his eyes in disbelief as Lola sashays toward the exit.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The new "Miss Lonely Hearts" in The Movie Grand Finale of _Our Miss Brooks_.
-   Gorgeous Virginia in _The Strawberry Blonde_, played by gorgeous Rita Hayworth. When someone spots her walking by Nick's barbershop, all the men lounging around in the barbershop rush outside so they can look at her. At the end of the movie she reveals that she used to walk blocks out of her way so she could walk past the barbershop and let the men gawk.
-   Mae West made a career out of this. In _She Done Him Wrong_, every male in the cast talks about how sexy she is, and most of them hit on her.
-   Cassandra from _Wayne's World_.
-   Jerri (Jayne Mansfield) in _The Girl Can't Help It_. All she wants to be is a housewife, but men don't see her that way.
-   Ulla in Mel Brooks' _The Producers_. This Sexy Secretary doesn't even attempt to type, but can she ever work! In the original movie at least, this is a slanderous lie. She does type, at the rate of about one letter a minute.
-   The five Salma Hayeks in _Across the Universe (2007)_ are as perfect of an example as you can get, collectively named The Bang Bang Shoot Nurses.
-   The Genterns from _Repo! The Genetic Opera_ are this trope personified and given a cute visor.
-   Even the human characters in _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ lust for the infamous Jessica Rabbit. She's not bad; she's just drawn that way.
-   Tina Carlyle in _The Mask_, reduces the civilian Jim Carrey to a gibbering wreck by asking to open a bank account, and causes his Masked alter ego to herniate his beating heart through his shirt and literally wolf-whistle.
-   Every character Marilyn Monroe ever played.
-   In _Dirty Rotten Scoundrels_, Janet Colgate makes her entrance as, well, this. Both con men go for her at once.... only for her to con _them_ by the end of the movie.
-   The Saffron Burrows character in _Enigma (2001)_.
-   Rita Hayworth played these type of characters especially in _Gilda_ and _The Loves of Carmen_.
-   Staff Nurse Dorothy Denton (Shirley Eaton) in _Carry On Nurse._ Eventually got her man, Ted York.
-   _Iron Man 2_ has two literal cases with Black Widow, as her very intro leads Tony to turn his head until Happy Hogan reminds him that their match isn't over (cue a kick so Tony can make his moves on the redhead), and while she puts on the Spy Catsuit, Happy almost crashes the car trying to take a peek. This also happened behind the scenes, as Jon Favreau famously tweeted that "he'd never seen such a quiet film crew before" Scarlett Johansson first appeared in the Black Widow catsuit.
-   _Flirting Scholar_: Chou-Heung's beauty is famous. She draws admiration from Tong's friends, the four perverted thieves, and the boatman who says he's frequently asked to "follow Chou-Heung".
-   Molly in _She's Out of My League_ personifies this trope—her introduction is one long slow-motion montage of her walking with a Supermodel Strut through an airport, catching the awed attention of every man (and teenage boy) she passes. When she gets to the TSA counter, the cynical and bored Stainer suddenly perks up. Later, when she meets Kirk's family, his mother squeals with glee and everyone else just stares.
-   Vesper Lynd in _Casino Royale (2006)_ has this effect on the _entire casino_ the first time she appears in that dress. Bond intended for her to enter from behind him so his opponents would be Distracted by the Sexy. Instead she enters right in his line of sight to screw with him after an argument and distracts _him_ as well.
-   Pam Bouvier in _Licence to Kill_ spends the film being The Lad-ette, but when she appears as Bond's "secretary", even Bond does a Double Take.
-   Lisa from _The Room (2003)_ has just about every male character in the movie comment on how hot she is. Even one guy whose sole line is "Lisa looks hot tonight!". Her actress does not exactly live up to it.
-   Another Lisa, this one played by Diane Kruger in _Wicker Park_. She does indeed live up to it.
-   Lady Penelope in the live-action _Thunderbirds_ movie. Her character introduction is being greeted by a crowd of prepubescent boys as she arrives to pick Alan up. And of course she has to say "Hello boys".
-   The White Queen from Tim Burton's _Alice in Wonderland (2010)_. Her sister the Red Queen laments that she can make anything fall in love with her... even the furniture.
-   Frey from _Elysium_.
-   Alex Munday (played by Lucy Liu) in _Charlie's Angels (2000)_ has this effect on men when she's walking in a room full of computer nerds while wearing a sexy leather powersuit (that squeaks every time she walks).
-   Played straight with the blond nurse in _The Bridge on the River Kwai_ who befriends Shears at the hospital. When she walks across the campus, all of the soldiers interrupt their combat training to follow her with their eyes.
-   _Starship Troopers 3: Marauder_. Captain Lola Beck evokes this reaction among her own crew, though as she's their superior officer their reaction is merely silent appreciation.
-   _Mon Oncle Antoine_: The Canadian mining town where the film is set is small enough to have a town beauty, and she is Alexandrine, wife of the notary. She's tall and beautiful and fashionably dressed, and when she goes to the general store—to pick up a corset—all the men in the store comment about how sexy she is.
-   Violet from _It's a Wonderful Life_ grows up to be this. She had her sights set on George, but turns pretty much _everyone's_ heads. One gag in particular has her crossing a street in a rather short and clingy dress (ogled by George, Bert, and Ernie), only for a pedestrian crossing the other direction to nearly get hit by a car when he gets distracted watching her. On the darker side of this trope, it's implied she Really Gets Around and has to leave Bedford Falls after getting into some trouble, and the Potterville version is shown getting dragged out of a seedy nightclub (at which she was likely one of the working girls) and thrown into a paddywagon by the police.
-   _The Bone Collector_. When Amelia Donaghy (played by Angelina Jolie) is assigned to work with the protagonist Lincoln Rhyme, he shares a smirk with another man in the room over his good fortune.
-   Elektra in _Daredevil (2003)_ gets this from three male characters when they see her. Foggy Nelson gives her an approving look that she ignores, Matt (in the rain due to his powers) sees her and says she's beautiful and she's flattered, Bullseye gives her a Wolf Whistle that she's disgusted by as he killed her father.
-   Post Makeover Sandy gets this response at the carnival in _Grease_.
-   In _Memoirs of a Geisha_, Mameha teaches Sayuri that this is the hallmark of a true geisha: she can stop a man in his tracks with a single look. Sayuri manages this with a boy on a bike—and when he turns his head and crashes seconds later, that proves Mameha's point.
-   In the extended version of _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_, there's a scene deleted from the original release, but included in the novelisation, in which Lt Ilia comes to the bridge for the first time. Once she takes her seat at the Navigation station, her Deltan pheremones cause Sulu to make a fool of himself, stammering and hitting the wrong switches, all the while smiling goofily. She reassures him that she's safe because she's taken an oath of celibacy.
-   DC Extended Universe:
    -   Wonder Woman as played by Gal Gadot in _Wonder Woman_, _Justice League_ and _Wonder Woman 1984_ is the subject of nearly constant oggling by the other characters in the room. Interestingly, the Zack Snyder films featuring her (_Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_, _Zack Snyder's Justice League_) avoid this trope.
    -   Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) causes this in _Suicide Squad_ as all the men (and some of the women) around her stop what they're doing to check her when she changes.
-   _Desperado_: Salma Hayek's character is introduced crossing the street and causing an accident because the drivers are staring at her.
-   _Woo_: In the opening scene, every passersby can't take their eyes off of Jada Pinkett's character when she walks around the city.
-   _Barbie (2023)_: The titular Stereotypical Barbie garners this reaction after she enters the Real World for the first time, with every guy in the vicinity giving her appreciative glances, catcalls, and whistles. The trope is deconstructed as this is played up as a hint to Barbie that the Real World isn't like the matriarchal Barbieland she came from (in spite of her initial assumptions) and quickly feels unsafe and self-conscious. It's one of the things she later cries over when Mattel finds her.

    Literature 

-   In _Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts_, this role is fulfilled by Hideyoshi Kinoshita. It's funny because he's a guy.
-   In _The Case Files of Jeweler Richard_, Richard attracts attention wherever he goes because he's that beautiful, to his chagrin.
-   Zoya, in _House Of Meetings_ by Martin Amis. One character is sent to a gulag in Siberia because he is overheard praising America. In fact he was praising "The Americas"—the nickname he and his brother had given Zoya due to her hourglass figure.
-   Elli Quinn in Lois McMaster Bujold's _Vorkosigan Saga_. After getting her face burned off in a battle, Miles paid for the finest reconstructive surgery for her that money could buy. Though initially delighted with the results, she later came to find it to be a problem at times, when soldiers under her command made passes at her, rather than following her orders.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   Dresden notes this is true about Thomas Raith and the other White Court Vampires, as they are literally supernaturally attractive. Just walking down the street is enough to get men and women alike to turn and stare. His sister Lara even made a name for herself in the "adult" film industry. (see _Blood Rites_).
    -   In the short story, _I Was A Teenage Bigfoot_, Dresden cheekily quotes the _Animaniacs_ character Hello Nurse, another example of this trope, at an attractive school nurse taking care of his client's son. Her dry response is that she's taking a break from dating cartoon characters and the children that love them.
-   Mia in _The Dark Tower_ series, who is a slutty ball-buster but who does gain some sympathy right before her newborn spider-baby kills her and drinks her blood.
-   _I Am Not a Serial Killer_ has Marci, a _sixteen-year-old_ who is massively popular in no small part because she evokes this reaction from every guy at her school. The series being what it is, this frequently takes a dip into So Beautiful, It's a Curse\-people pigeonhole and objectify her because she's hot, and those reactions aren't limited to guys her age. She readily admits that part of the reason she's after John is that he's the first male since the town hit puberty who's been more interested in talking to her than ogling her.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Veelas. A "cheerleading" squad of them can make a whole mega _stadium_ of men go wild. Although they also can go One-Winged Angel, growing wings and a bird beak and throwing fireballs... There are also half-Veela, like Fleur Delacour, who are (generally) very attractive women with some ability to magically influence men.
    -   The first thing Harry notices about Cho Chang is that she is "extremely pretty". It's rather inconvenient as this comes right before he has to play against her in a Quidditch match. Later on in the book he gets very hot under the collar when she wishes him good luck. And in the next he spills water all over himself when she waves at him. That being said, it's also possible Harry just has a giant crush on her, considering their ages at the time.
-   Dmitri in _The Brothers Karamazov_ can't help but speak of Grushenka's "infernal curves" dancing about in his mind, driving him insane with lust.
-   Rhapsody in the _Symphony of Ages_ series by Elizabeth Haydon. This was partly due to natural beauty, but mostly due to the fire magic from her journey through the center of the earth.
-   In _War and Peace_, Elena Kuragin, more often called Hélène (a name derived from—oh just guess!), is perhaps the most beautiful woman _ever born_. She's the sort of woman that makes grown men weep and young boys lock themselves in bathrooms.
-   _Cloud of Sparrows_ by Takashi Matsuoka has Emily, a Christian missionary that comes to Japan fleeing from the men in her country who apparently considered her so irresistible that she almost got raped twice. It doesn't help that she's about to marry a bible thumping guy who can't help getting aroused every time she walks by.
-   Despite living in a country of extremely beautiful people, everyone still manages to think that Phedre is, well, most extremely beautiful of all.
-   Helen of Troy is the original one, and judging by her being played by Diane Kruger in _Troy_, she still measures up pretty well.
-   In the Tolkien's Legendarium:
    -   _The Silmarillion_: Lúthien Tinuviel, the most beautiful woman in the world. Everyone who crossed her path tried to claim her, including Morgoth.
    -   _The Lord of the Rings_: Arwen, Lúthien's great-great-great-granddaughter, was also supposed to be her exact spitting-image: considering the wars fought over Lúthien, Elrond may have been wise to keep her cooped up in Rivendell.
-   Succubi in _The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump_ have this quality, obviously. When a bunch of them gathered to picket city hall in protest over Angel City's new anti-vice laws, they didn't bother to bring signs, because their "arguments" were self-evident.
-   Several can be found in the _Wheel of Time_ series. Morgase and Elayne often tie men's tongues, as does Berelain (though it appears she'll be meeting her match in her "Man In White" in the next novel).
    -   Elayne's hated step-brother Galad, who's so beautiful that drooling Aes Sedai gather to watch him take off his shirt.
    -   The nation whose women are known around the world for having this quality, and using it to their advantage in trade: Arad Doman.
    -   The most potent example is Lanfear, however. She actually uses Illusion to _tone down_ her beauty, and _still_ trips up any man she talks to.
-   _So, I Can't Play H!_: Ilia's a buxom blonde bombshell and a popular teen idol. Naturally, when she enrolls at Ryosuke's school, she immediately drew crowds of fans and would-be suitors. This is also the reason why the Merlot Insurance company uses her in all of their ads.
-   Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_:
    -   Juliet in _Unseen Academicals_.
    -   Sergeant Angua of the Watch. (Nobody dares to wolf-whistle at her ... especially during a full moon).
    -   The lovely Tawneee, a woman who was Miss April, May, and June in _Girls, Giggles and Garters_—a woman who has so intimidated men through her looks that the only boyfriend she can get is Corporal Nobby Nobbs of the Watch. Who later dumps her because she cannot cook.
-   _Dragonlance_:
    -   Laurana. The first time the Companions see her they are completely mesmerized and can do nothing but stare at her and babble on about how she is the most beautiful woman they have ever seen. Even Raistlin is affected by her beauty. Later on her Arch-Enemy, Kitiara, can do nothing but bitterly complain about how everyone raves about Laurana's beauty.
    -   Many characters notice Silvara is extremely attractive, which is actually an annoyance for her since she doesn't want to stand out she usually purposedly stays covered in layers of grime and filth to downplay this, with limited success. And while she's Silver Dragon and thus a Voluntary Shapeshifting she actually _can't_ take a form that isn't considered attractive by whatever species she shapeshifts into. Her body as Arlena Plata is the closest she got to a normal human woman, after _years_ of practicing and she's still considered far above average.
-   Dejah Thoris, from _John Carter of Mars_, is referred to as "the incomparable Dejah Thoris" for a reason.
    -   Her daughter Tara and granddaughter Llana share this trait. Multiple men are willing to ignore Tara's personality flaws because of her beauty, and one character who sees a figurine of Llana refuses to believe that it is of a real person, on the grounds that real women can't possibly be that beautiful.
-   Juliet the succubus in Mike Carey's Felix Castor series. _No one_ should be able to do _that_ to a man with no blood circulation...
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   Sansa Stark suffers as a result of this trope: in her Crapsack World, it usually manifests as a desire to rape/molest her. Her various 'admirers', most of whom treat her like a piece of meat, include Joffrey, Sandor Clegane, Tyrion Lannister, Marillion, her adoptive brother Theon, and Littlefinger. At thirteen she's either matured extremely early or is trapped in a nest of pedophiles.
    -   Daenerys Targaryen also would suffer from this same trope if she didn't have a Queensguard and three dragons to protect her. Most men that are interested in her dragons are willing to forgo them to bed Daenerys; of course, she's not very flattered at this.
    -   Shiera Seastar, Great Bastard daughter of Aegon IV was _THE_ head turner at her time; it's said that men went to war for her sake, though only Bittersteel is confirmed to have done so when she preferred Bloodraven over him.
    -   Lyanna Stark caused a whole continent to go tits up when she eloped with the Targaryen heir to the Iron Throne, a married man and herself being betrothed to an immensely powerful warrior in Robert Baratheon. It ended up destroying the Targaryen rule and killing her; all because she looked gorgeous in a blue flower tiara.
    -   Dalla and Val from the Free Folk are about the most beautiful Wildlings in existence. They have heads turning in the Wildlings, of course, the Night's Watch and on the forces of King Stannis Baratheon... if they get past the fact that they can carve them with a spear.
-   Nicci, of _The Sword of Truth._ She's a buxom, blonde-haired and blue-eyed goddess who habitually dresses in tight and low-cut black dresses, and makes the previously-proclaimed World's Most Beautiful Woman Kahlan Amnell _feel ugly_ by comparison. Of course, she's also a deeply troubled and _incredibly_ powerful Dark Magical Girl and Dark Action Girl who uses and lives up to the epithet Death's Mistress even _after_ her High-Heel–Face Turn. But man, what a way to go.
-   Angel of _Redeeming Love_. There’s a reason she’s the highest-priced “soiled dove” in Pair-O-Dice by a huge margin, and she has to go out walking with a bodyguard to avoid being accosted. Now cue the entrance of the Celibate Hero. Shake well for drama.
-   Model Joanna Clark in Elise Title's _The Face in the Mirror_.
    
    Judging from the mesmerized stares of her brand new fan club, the rest of the woman lived up to those Betty Grable legs and then some.
    
-   Both Gloss and Cashmere of _The Hunger Games_ are described as beautiful.
-   Dread Empress Malicia from _A Practical Guide to Evil_ is described as absolutely, stunningly beautiful, to the point she even gets a reaction out of the asexual Masego and has had people _kill_ to have a conversation with her. She uses it to great effect, playing up the role of the seductress with enchanted dresses in public so that everyone only thinks with their loins around her. In private, though, she is a much pruder person.
-   Jane Bennet in _Pride and Prejudice_ is this. Besides once inducing a man into sending her poetry, attracting Charles Bingley to herself, and being Mr Collins' first choice for wife, everybody acknowledges that she is the prettiest of the attractive Bennet sisters, and even Mr Darcy, who has never anything nice to say about anybody, is ready to honestly admit that she is very pretty (although she smiles too much).
-   Greta in Lawrence Block's _The Canceled Czech_.
    
    She was tall, almost my height, and her long blonde hair melted over her shoulders. Her eyes were a deep, vivid blue. Her body was long and leggy and yet more than abundantly curved. An old Norseman would have carved her on the prow of his ship; whatever his skill, he could not possibly have improved on the original.
    
-   In _The Arts of Dark and Light_, almost no one who meets Lithriel fails to comment on her striking beauty. _Literally_ no one fails to be struck by it. Whether the observer is an older, happily married man, an officer with Fantastic Racism against elves like her, or even another woman.
-   In _The Surgeon_ (the first _Rizzoli & Isles_ book), Detective Jane Rizzoli bitterly describes Dr. Catherine Cordell as this, increasingly jealous over the woman's good looks and her partner's burgeoning relationship with her.
-   Rosa's unusual beauty in _The House of the Spirits_ when Esteban Trueba sees her for the first time causes a crowd of men to form outside the window of the shop she is in - however this same beauty intimidates men to the point where nobody has ever ventured to marry her. She is known after her death as Rosa the Beautiful.
-   _Second Apocalypse_: Anasûrimbor Serwa, due to the nigh-superhuman blood of her Dunyain father, is physically flawless. When she attends war meetings, she's said to be "a lodestone on men's eyes."

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Downton Abbey_: Gender Inverted with Jimmy the handsome footman, who gets the downstairs ladies, the upstairs ladies and Thomas to all light up with interest, and causes a disapproving Carson to say that hard work and industriousness is more important than being handsome.
-   _The Big Bang Theory_ Penny is universally attractive to every nerd in the series. The same is true for Sheldon's sister and the other three main nerds.
-   _Our Miss Brooks_: In "New Girl", all the boys at Madison immediately fall for the titular girl. Worse, from Miss Brooks' perspective, Mr. Boynton starts to fall for her mother.
-   _Game of Thrones_: Talisa. When presented to Walder Frey, he understands why Robb romped with her. That didn't make him any less angry that Robb snubbed one of Walder’s own daughters by doing so.
    -   Daenerys. One look at her has Daario fall head over heels and brutally murder his long standing fellow mercenary partners and present their heads to her. Along with the mercenary troops.
-   In _Happy Endings_, this is the gang's reaction (even Max's) to Shershow's fiance, right after Penny says that anyone who would marry him must be "busted in la fache".
    
    **Max:** Wow, Shershow, you hit it out of the park. She's both beautiful and says Honduras the fancy way.  
    **Penny:** She's really pretty.  
    **Max:** Pretty? I mean, she's a living doll. I am attracted to you — very much so. And I am a gay man.
    
-   _Angel_. This was any red-blooded human's reaction to Gwen Raiden's entrance. This behavior is, however, Freudian, given that her powers ensure that she is a virgin (you can't touch her without getting an electric shock) as she admits in "Players". Male Gaze is the closest to sex she can get.

-   _Never Have I Ever_:
    -   Kamala's beauty is enough to make random men crash into the Vishwakumars' trash bins and walls at the sight of her.
    -   Her would-be fiance, Prashant, actually stuns the Vishwakumars silent with his good looks when he first shows up at their doorstep. A pleased Devi tells him that they were expecting someone ugly.
-   Gloria "Ripples" Brancusi, RN, from _Trapper John MD_ is another sympathetic example.
-   In _Mad Men_: Joan Holloway (played by Christina Hendricks), the bitchy, seductive secretary with the _unbelievable_ body, who turns out to be both extremely bright and pragmatic enough to realize that her intelligence is going to do her exactly no good at all in the giant boys' club where she works.
-   In _Firefly_ Saffron (also played by Christina Hendricks) had this going for her too, especially in her first appearance when she was pretending to be an Innocent Fanservice Girl.
-   _Bones_: According to Booth, "There isn't a guy in this country who _wouldn't_ want to have sex with Temperance Brennan, including half the gay men." Of course, it _is_ Emily Deschanel.
-   _That '70s Show_:
    -   Donna's mother, Midge. Most of the male characters openly admit they'd like to sleep with her. The boys buy her sweaters as Christmas gifts so they can ogle her. Once, when Kelso and Fez thought Eric had slept with her, they both fell to their knees and started bowing to him. Of course it turned out that it was all just a misunderstanding.
    -   Jackie's mother, Pam, played by Brooke Shields. A particularly well-executed instance, in that the male characters react to her according to their individual personalities. When the Formans invite Pam and Bob over, Eric and Hyde dress up but coyly feign ignorance about her coming over; Red acts helpful to Pam while ignoring the other guests and even Kitty, and Kelso, in his usual style, bursts through the door shouting, "What's she wearing?"
    -   In a parody of the _Grease_ example above, Jackie draws the same reaction when she appears in the Bad Sandy get-up.
-   The first season of _M\*A\*S\*H_ had Nurse Cutler, whom Hawkeye and Trapper went to ludicrous and sometimes life-threatenening lengths to keep at the 4077.

-   _Will & Grace_ has Dr. Morty, played by Nicolette Sheridan. Grace mentions to Leo she is uncomfortable with him working with her. He responds that she's not his type, to which Grace immediately retorts, "Oh, please. She's everyone's type, hell, I'd do her."
-   The _Saturday Night Live_ character "Shanna" played by Kristin Wiig makes fun of this trope. She's a voluptuous secretary who speaks in a breathy Marilyn Monroe-like voice and the men in her office drool over her until she attempts to do something sexily. Instead of it being sexy it ends up being gross and weird. All the men are put off by her increasingly disgusting traits except the boss who grows more and more infatuated with her.
-   _Friends_:
    -   In one episode Monica accidentally hires a hooker for Chandler, and Chandler and Joey answer the door for her. They both have a reaction that screams "_Helllllllo_ Nurse!" Particularly Joey, as evidenced by his party favor.
    -   Monica and Ross's cousin (played by Denise Richards) gets this reaction from Chandler, Ross and Phoebe.
-   While this isn't how she is normally perceived, Claire Bennet is hired by a comic book store for the obvious effect she will have on their clientele.
-   Nurse Goodbody on _Hee Haw_.
-   On _Scrubs_, we have Heather Locklear guest starring, complete with JD's Imagine Spot of her doing a Supermodel Strut that makes someone in a body bag sit up to stare. Turk brings up a threeway ambition he's had for a while, and Carla doesn't mind the idea. Of course, she didn't realize he would actually ask Locklear.
-   Cerie on _30 Rock_. She is usually oblivious to her effect on everyone. Most of her wardrobe is ultra-mini skirts and shorts, and very revealing tops, which don't help. Liz tries to get her to wear more office-appropriate clothes... and eventually gives up.
-   _NCIS_ has pulled this trope a few times by putting the normally rough-and-tumble Ziva into a bikini or a backless, slinky dress. But it kicks it up a notch in the episode in which Abby dresses like Marilyn Monroe, or any episode in which Abby is shown wearing mainstream business attire.
-   Appears in _American Chopper_ in the form of a custom-built ambulance motorcycle.
-   Sarah Walker on _Chuck_ has this effect on pretty much everyone. Ellie is practically giddy when she meets Chuck's gorgeous "girlfriend" for the first time, and especially early in the series many characters don't believe Chuck could possibly be dating someone like her.
-   Kelly Bundy in _Married... with Children_. Pretty much every male on the show (except for her father and her brother) drools over her.
-   Two from _Diplomatic Immunity_:
    -   First of all Jonah is caught secretly seeing an Eastern European woman called Svetlana. The word "hot" is used in almost every sentence referring to her.
    -   Kirsty is also this to the men belonging to the CBOB Church - something she is not happy about, as they propose to her every year.
    -   Leilani manages to be this and the Only Sane Man. She's trying to abolish the corrupt monarchy in Fe'ausi, and sometimes uses her beauty to get people to listen to her cause. She is Leighton's primary love interest, and Jonah suspects from the first episode he could use the former's attraction to her to his advantage.
-   In the 100th episode of _How I Met Your Mother_, MacLaren's hired an attractive female bartender which caused all the guys (except Marshall) to have the hots on her which made Robin jealous. Barney wants to bed her only to find out that she hates dating suit wearers because her ex-boyfriends wear them. Robin theorised it was solely because she was a cute girl behind a bar. When she went behind the bar to prove a point, she had this effect on the customers too.
-   _8 Simple Rules_ - Bridget is courted by all the boys (and some girls too) and is infinitely popular because of it. One episode shows her getting on the PA system and announcing only her name - getting audible cheers from the whole school. It is shown that this may be down to her charisma as well as beauty; one episode has her get a broken nose and she worries that she won't be popular anymore. Turns out they still love her.
-   S Club 7 portrayed Rachel Stevens this way in the TV show. She would have several love interests and be presented as the attractive one of the band - it was usually her who provided the most overt Fanservice. In real life she was the only member who didn't have to audition - being discovered through her modelling agency and asked to come in to record a demo. She's continued to be a sex symbol even in her forties!
-   _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_ gives us Sabrina's aunt Vesta, portrayed by 60s and 70s sex symbol Raquel Welch. She enters posing as a substitute teacher, reducing all the boys in class to drooling morons. She also has a room in her Pleasure Dome full of single men.
-   In the pilot episode of _Deep Space Nine_, even Commander Sisko can't restrain a whistle of appreciation at Jadzia Dax. The irony being that when he last knew 'her' he was Curzon Dax, an elderly man. A few episodes later she's shown walking on the promenade with Major Kira, enjoying the greetings from passing men and saying she'd forgotten how different being female was.
-   _Star Trek: Enterprise_. Green Skinned Space Babes from Orion have this effect in the _entire_ male crew, though it's actually related to their pheromones.
-   _Sex Education_: Foreign Exchange Student Rahim from France. When he's introduced, the horde of Moordale students trip over themselves to get a look at him, they stop and stare, and rumors start flying around instantly. Even the most popular kids "The Untouchables" are impressed with him and Ruby decides he will be her boyfriend. Lily says she just had a very small orgasm just from looking at him. Eric stares, calls Otis to have a look and then calls him the hottest man he's ever seen.
-   Naevia in _Spartacus: Blood and Sand_ is a Beautiful Slave Girl who is selected by Lucretia to become her personal attendant - meaning her virginity will be preserved precisely because she would be considered an attractive prospect for someone to marry. In-universe she attracts Crixus, Asher and a couple of guards she seduces for information. Her actress Leslie Ann Brandt also plays Leilani in the _Diplomatic Immunity_ example above.
-   _The White Lotus_: Rachel Patton, played by Alexandra Daddario, tries to engage college rich kid Olivia in polite, poolside conversation and receives only smug condescension. After giving up, Rachel strips to her swimsuit and wades into the pool. Olivia's smirk disappears into a stunned reaction when she sees Rachel's ridiculously statuesque figure.
-   _Mrs. America_: Just like in real life, Gloria Steinem is noted for being _stunningly_ beautiful, and people seem incapable of not mentioning her looks when talking about her. Even Alice is stunned the first time she sees her. Gloria herself is frustrated by this, as she knows a lot of people only see her as a sex symbol and aren't interested in her ideas and writings, and she doesn't want to be a mere poster girl for the feminist movement she's trying to help push forward. She also endures harrassment and objectification from her politial opponents. Bella advises her to make use of it, since her beauty makes people pay attention, and that's at least something.
-   _Utopia Falls_: Brooklyn is very pretty, and knows it, drawing others' immediate attention when she enters the room (Sage notices in particular, soon becoming her girlfriend).
-   _Banjun Drama_: Exaggerated in "My Life's Eraser." Yoo-jin is so beautiful that her mere presence causes men (and a dog) to literally turn their heads and fawn over her, with a crowd of guys following her as she walks out of a restaurant with her husband. Men are so head over heels that one admirer breaks into her house and attempts to kill her husband to make her his.

    Music 

-   Nurse Rosetta, the title character of a song from Alice Cooper's _From the Inside_ album.
-   Doctor Steel has "Nurses" (members of his Army of Toy Soldiers that dress in sexy nurse uniforms) attend him—both on stage and other public appearances and in several of his videos.
-   The song "Brain Damage", from Eminem's first commercial album _The Slim Shady LP_, gives us the line, "Teacher, teacher! Quick, I need a naked nurse!"
-   The music video for "As Good As I Once Was" by Toby Keith. The final scene sees Keith—playing a bar patron socked by a giant muscle man during a barroom brawl—in the back of an ambulance, tended to by a sexy female paramedic. Keith tries to pinch her behind before he ultimately passes out; the final moments of the video are seen from Keith's perspective, with the screen turning blurry before going black as he slowly loses consciousness, the medic the last thing he sees.
-   The song "Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On" in spades. The girl in the song causes _traffic jams_ while wearing blue jeans!
-   The Brazilian Bossa Nova song "The Girl From Ipanema" is precisely about a girl that doesn't even realize that she's turning heads as she walks.
-   Eric Clapton's "Wonderful Tonight"
    
    _We go to a party  
    And everyone turns to see  
    This beautiful lady  
    That's walking around with me  
    And then she asks me, "Do you feel alright?"  
    And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"_
    
-   Sammy Kershaw's "She Don't Know She's Beautiful," in both the first and second verse. At the first, they're at a party, and "people stop and everybody stares" as they come in. In the second, they're walking down the street "and someone lets a whistle out." In both cases, he thinks it's cute because she doesn't know _she_ is the one causing all the fuss.

    Pinballs 

-   The backglass art from WhizBang Pinball's _Whoa Nellie! Big Juicy Melons!_ shows Melony, eldest of the three daughters of the Mellon farm, trying to sell her wares... oblivious to the lustful farm workers (and horse) distracted behind her.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Pretty much any woman in Professional Wrestling who doesn't look masculine. Female managers and valets are known to take advantage of this by using their... assets to Distract their client's opponents (and the refs), allowing their client to get the win.
-   Tammy Lynn Sytch initially tried being an evil feminist while acting as a valet for Chris Candido and Balls Mahoney, but after realizing how pretty she was thought of, she decided women shouldn't be wrestlers when she could get by on how she looked. Debra was another. She was the one the Unusual Euphemism "Puppies" was about. She would receive standing ovations simply for walking down the entrance aisle. When she was forced by match stipulation to perform a striptease, she had the crowd in the palm of her hand.
-   Terri Runnels had a moderate amount of wrestling knowledge, but she didn't train for strength, cardio or even wrestling as such. She trained for looks, and to move with her boob job, and to move in tiny pieces of Nude-Colored Clothing. It all worked very well, and indeed was deemed more "diva" than wrestler or even valet. She was still a good valet though, as she made sure to turn heads back to Goldust when it was match time.
-   WWE would like you to forget Terri and Sunny(Tammy) and have one believe Sable was the first of these in post territorial professional wrestling. She _was_ the first woman to ever become insanely popular just because of her breathtaking beauty, not having the talents of her two mentioned predecessors but overtaking them anyway. She was also one of the Trope Codifiers for Smurfette Breakout as her popularity eclipsed that of her husband.
-   Trish Stratus was this before she had entered a wrestling company. WWE and WCW had a bidding war to try and get her to join them. The extent of this was so huge that at her Hall of Fame induction, when she mentioned her husband, the fans in attendance booed (at the idea that Trish was no longer available).
-   Torrie Wilson was a more playful Girl Next Door example of this. While she provided plenty of Fanservice, she managed to be The Woobie as well.
-   Stacy Keibler was rarely pushed in a wrestling capacity but she would always receive monstrous pops simply from walking down the entrance ramp (and giving a little panty shot as part of her ring entrance). All down to her stunning beauty. She plays the female bartender listed in the _How I Met Your Mother_ example above.
-   Traci Brooks was literally this in TNA, walking by and attracting enough attention for her man, be it Robert Roode, James Storm or some other, to punch his opponent while he was distracted. In the event she couldn't distract a man this way, Brooks would get upset and try to hit him with her "pie in the sky" Finishing Move. America's Most Wanted also had Gail Kim and Jacqueline for the same purpose, with the same attitude when the act didn't work, although when Jacqueline moved on to Beer Money and ended up next to Brooks, Storm mentioned that he liked having Jacqueline around but thought Traci's looks were her only value. Roode went further and attempted to replace Brooks with Peyton Banks, but he still made sure the replacement had a giant chest before making that decision.
-   Rayna Von Tosh of _SHIMMER_ managed to inspire this reaction with her burlesque pin-up gimmick. Within two appearances she already had the crowd chanting "R-V-T!" repeatedly. It seems Even the Girls Want Her too.
    
    **Allison Danger:** Rayna, I'm happily married, but Mazel Tov to ya.
    
-   Done quite literally in New Japan Pro-Wrestling by Yujiro Takahashi, who has taken on a sleazy womanising gimmick that sees him walk to the ring with two models dressed in skimpy nurse outfits.
-   Kelly Kelly was another who provoked this reaction, as her first gimmick was that of a stripteaser. She was Jerry Lawler's favourite Diva and he would always go wild whenever she walked out.
-   Eva Marie became a Breakout Character of _Total Divas_ and was promoted as the sexy one of the cast, getting a cover of Maxim and several high profile modelling gigs. Of course within the smart mark community she had a very vocal Hatedom due to her lack of wrestling skills.
-   Paige was actually this in her pre-WWE career. The documentary following her signing to WWE has an interview with her mother, describing how she realised that if she put her daughter's face on merchandise, it would immediately sell due to her beauty. In WWE however, she was portrayed more as a Not Like Other Girls tomboy who called herself the 'Anti-Diva'.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Nymphs in _Dungeons & Dragons_ are so beautiful that merely looking at them can make you go blind. Or in some editions, dead! (In some cases, looking at a _clothed_ nymph will blind you, while looking at a _nude_ one can kill you.) Most women require an extra step.
-   The Crimson Rose and Silessa, the Snake Mistress in _Ravenloft_ are two exotic dancing beauties in the Carnival that stand out among its less-fortunate looking members. The latter is an asp snake turned into an impossibly gorgeous elf babe with many admirers In-Universe and whose character description in The Carnival rulebook drips with Male Gaze. The former can actually magically enthrance any men who watches her dance, although, she is also cursed into flying in murderous rage if they make a move on her.
-   You can play as one in the _Old World of Darkness_ since Appearance is an attribute measured from 1 to 5. One is ugly, two is average, three is the pinnacle of mortal beauty. You can take it up 4 (legendary) and 5 (impossibly beautiful). In Exalted, you can take this **to ten**. The sight of which would probably kill mere mortals.
    -   The Sidhe, from _Changeling: The Dreaming_, get 2 free dots in Appearance which means that at least they are more beautiful than an average woman and at their full potential they are, virtually, beauty goddesses.
-   The restructuring of the system into _Chronicles of Darkness_ drops Appearance, but has the similar Presence attribute. However, this is less your looks and more your general allure. Playing it straight is the merit Striking Looks; at two dots, people notice you in a crowd, while at four dots you could be a supermodel.
    -   This is a requirement for a Galateid in _Promethean: The Created_. Galateids must use the bodies of beautiful young adults who died in a "clean" way in order to create their offspring. Striking Looks isn't a _necessity_, but most have it anyway. It's noted that there's a derth of pretty young people who die of gas leaks or overdoses, leaving most Galateids with few options.
-   _SNK vs. Capcom_'s TCG has this as a reaction card. It has Morrigan Aensland in a nurse outfit similar to the one she uses in _Super Gem Fighter_.

    Theatre 

-   The Sexy Secretary Hedy LaRue from _How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying_ is this in every sense. From the total meltdowns of the male cast members who see her Supermodel Strut to only wanting the—technically not—Chaste Hero.She traps him so he has to kiss her or lose his job, and once he does he realizes that he's in love with the female lead who'd been previously practically throwing herself at him without him really noticing, _during the kiss_. (At which point Hedy seems genuinely pleased for him!)
-   The nurse, naturally enough, in the Doctor's Office sketch from _Oh! Calcutta!_.
-   Stupefyin' Jones in the musical version of _Li'l Abner_, (along with the film adaptation, in both cases originally played by Julie Newmar) whose sex appeal is so devastating that she's classified as munitions.

    Video Games 

-   _Bully_: Art teacher Ms. Philips is widely considered the hottest woman on campus by half the male students, to the point one student acknowledges that she was a bunny waitress in college. Even Jimmy gets his hopes up too high when she requires him to get her clothing for her date with the English teacher.
-   Morrigan Aensland, the flirty succubus from _Darkstalkers_. Cat Girl Felicia also qualifies from her Stripperific appearance and added that she's an exotic battle dancer from Vegas to boot.
-   _Dragon Age: Origins_:
    -   If the Warden is female, she's this trope. Several of the NPCs comment very admiringly on how beautiful she is, particularly if she's the human noble. Zevran's reaction to a female player character in _Dragon Age: Origins_ suggests this.
    -   Marjolaine has this effect on Leliana's male teammates in the opening of the DLC _Leliana's Song_. Partially justified by her training as a bard.
-   _Tales of Symphonia_:
    -   Sheena Fujibayashi, of the oblivious or unwilling to exploit it type. (It is implied she is a virgin.) In fact, she tends to get violently defensive whenever anyone (especially Zelos) starts mentioning her looks. True to trope, the only person whose attentions she wouldn't mind would be Lloyd's—who for the most part wouldn't know romance if it came along and struck him hard in the head.
    -   To a lesser extent, Raine Sage, who has a fanclub in her hometown of Iselia.
-   _Disgaea_ has this as a gameplay element:
    -   In the first game, _Disgaea: Hour of Darkness_, Jennifer, Hyper-Competent Sidekick of **Captain Gordon, Defender of Earth!**, is sufficiently sexy enough to make the protagonist _literally_ allergic to her. This affects his fighting capabilities... negatively.
    -   _Disgaea 2_ has Rozalin, who buffs the power of male units surrounding her.
    -   _Disgaea 3_ added Sapphire, who powers up male allies much like Rozalin, and Master Big Star, who can get an evility which lets him power up female allies.
    -   _Disgaea 4_ has Vulcanus/Artina the busty thief angel who, just like her predecessors, makes the male units surrounding her stronger.
    -   _Disgaea 5_ has Seraphina's Balor Gaze, an overload power that charms all male enemies in range for one turn.
-   In _Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance_, every support conversation involving Nephenee or Lucia includes someone telling them how beautiful they are.
-   Honorable mention goes to Reina Mayuzumi from _Trauma Center_ (more specifically, _Under The Knife 2_).
    -   Sadly, her beauty was, in many ways, only skin deep. In fact, she turned into a crippled old lady once the GUILT she knowingly and willingly incubated in her body became active.
-   Litchi Faye-Ling from _BlazBlue_. On top of being a doctor/nurse, her assistant says everyone in Orient Town is crazy about her, and let's not even talk about how crazy Bang Shishigami is towards her. Well, judging on how she looks, who'd blame her? It helps that she's a genuinely kind person.
-   Krystal from the _Star Fox_ series. When the protagonist, Fox McCloud sees her for the very first time, he is mesmerized by her beauty (with Sexophone as background music even), needing a comms buzz from Peppy in order to pull him out of it. She later becomes part of the team, and returns Fox's affections, resulting in plenty of Unresolved Sexual Tension between her and Fox, with mixes of She Is Not My Girlfriend, Everyone Can See It, and My Sensors Indicate You Want to Tap That. They later become a couple. Panther Caruso has also become madly attracted to her, although on a far more superficial level than Fox, having apparently heard of her beauty from afar prior to meeting her, and then Wolf Whistles and essentially decides to pursue her once he does, whether she likes it or not.
-   Ellis has this reaction to Zoey in _Left 4 Dead 2_. Somewhat ironic in the beaten up Zoey had just come through the Zombie Apocalypse and wasn't exactly looking her best. But she was one of the only two women left in the world, so Ellis didn't have much to chose from. She was still pretty fucking gorgeous<small>◊</small> despite going through an apocalypse, though.
-   Silvia from _The Act_ although (one of the male doctors berates her for letting Edgar in the hospital outside of visiting hours) Trope is actually referenced by (its original) name in her character bio.
-   In nearly every entry of the _Suikoden_ series, barring the first, _everyone_ is crazy about the beautiful skimpy runemistress Jeane. This is later semi-justified that on her body is a rune called "Charm Rune" which made those near her swoon over her. The reason why she's not like that in the first game is because _Suikoden_ was still a fledgling series and her Ms. Fanservice and Hello, Nurse! status hadn't been capitalized at the moment.
-   Valentine in _Skullgirls_ causes this a lot, even causing Peacock to quote the original trope name verbatim upon seeing her.
-   Mercy from _Overwatch_ is a lovely Swiss Miss, who acts as one the key healers of the Support Class. True she's more of a Battle Nurse but her appearance is simply heavenly to the eye.
-   Fall-From-Grace in _Planescape: Torment_ is considered incredibly attractive in-universe due to her nature as a succubus and possessing inhumanly high charisma — according to Nordom, she is considered to be attractive by males of 321,423 separate species (give or take five). Being a Celibate Hero who prefers to dress modestly (ironically enough for her race) doesn't deter this trope at all. Even Annah, the game's designated Ms. Fanservice, feels jealous of her.
-   Nintendo took Link's usual Chick Magnet status to its logical conclusion in _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_, where countless NPCs will hit on Link or comment on his attractiveness regardless of gender or species. It only escalates further when he's in drag, as some men he talks to can't even put a coherent sentence together in his presence.
    
    **Benji:** (Don't mess this up, don't mess this up...) H-h-h-hey there! Date you want a go do on to?!
    
-   _Final Fantasy VII Remake_
    -   Several characters in-game commentate on how attractive Tifa is. Chocobo Sam even finds it extremely unlikely for Don Corneo to pick anyone else as his bride.
    -   Aerith is treated as Hollywood Homely by Wall Market NPCs at first, but becomes this if the most expensive dress is obtained for the Don Corneo rescue mission. It's a cleavage-bearing red number that unveils Aerith's stunning beauty. She attracts a huge crowd of admirers and even the hardass mercenary protagonist is left a stuttering mess.
    -   Many NPCs and most of female cast comment on Cloud being attractive. When he dresses up as a woman most of the Wall Market NPCs are smitten by him and Chadley feels emotions for the first time upon seeing Cloud.
-   _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_:
    -   The Player Character (canonically female) is stated to be this, being beautiful and very charasmatic. This is because of her ability to subconciously form Force Bonds, attracting others, Force Sensitives especially, to her. Throughout the game, the female Exile captures the affection of Atton, Disciple, and even _Darth Sion_.
    -   Mira actively uses this and her Stripperiffic wardrobe to her advantage against male targets.

    Visual Novels 

-   Dahlia Hawthorne in _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_. She's actually a near-demonic psychopath. She elicits the effect by being small and delicate, rather than sexy, though.
    -   Also, April May of the first game. Every man who meets her (except Edgeworth) is instantly smitten. There's even official art of her in a nurse uniform!<small>◊</small>
    -   Mia Fey, having the advantage of a bigger bust than both Dahlia and April, gets quite a bit of this too from characters such as Larry, Gumshoe, and Victor Kudo, especially when Maya or Pearl is channeling her, since their outfit gets a Navel-Deep Neckline.
    -   In _The Great Ace Attorney_, when witness Jezaille Brett arrives in court, her beauty and charm captivates and stuns the entire courtroom into silence. Even Kazuma, who at this point suspected Jezaille to be the real murderer gently teases Ryunosuke for somehow failing to notice or remember "a woman like that" sitting across from the victim.

    Web Animation 

-   Vet\-sama from the hilariously terrible YouTube Fanime, _Nyan~ Neko Sugar Girls_ , parodies this trope. She's _meant_ to be attractive, and the other characters behave as if she is. The male ones, anyway.
-   Eric Schwartz's made-on-the-Amiga _Amy the Squirrel_ series of animated shorts (would be web-original, but they predate the web, having been made in The '80s) is possibly an inspiration for Minerva Mink. Amy's still around in the _Sabrina Online_ comic. Viewable here. (Sadly that is the original sound quality.)

    Webcomics 

-   Madame Louisa Dem Five from _Buck Godot: Zap Gun for Hire_. Quoth herself,
    
    **Louisa Dem Five:** I cause so many moral crises that the Slag Bah consider me a religion.
    
-   In the DeviantArt fancomic _Disney High School_, one comic reveals that _**Jessica Rabbit**_, of all people, is the School Nurse! Of course, she's smart enough to know the effect she has on the boys and plans accordingly.
-   _Dominic Deegan: Oracle For Hire_ had a plot arc called "Hello Nurse!" in which "plain" nurse Pamela Chayler (who was really Beautiful All Along) gets a makeover in hopes of attracting Gregory Deegan's attention. Of course, when she opens the door in her sexy new outfit, she finds not Gregory but a troop of horny slaughterball players.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Tedd specifically designs a form to elicit this reaction to put other card tournament players off their game.
-   _Eerie Cuties_: In-univese, Layla is such a hottie that she's both a Dude Magnet _and_ a _chick_ magnet! So much so, that when the guys at school thought she was a lesbian, it literally had them in tears lamenting they'd never have the chance to be with her. She's also garnered a canonical crush from Brooke (a bi girl), who secretly nurses unrequited feelings for her and a group of girls actually took her to the prom.
-   _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ has Princess Voluptua.<small>◊</small> It's worth remembering that her appearance is an illusion and she is actually a giant alien butterfly, and also that she is arguably the most mature member of the cast. (At several centuries old, she oughta be.) But _still...!_
-   In _Jupiter-Men_, the Doll Set is a Girl Posse of perfectly groomed and dressed cheerleaders who are the talk of Jupiter High. As their title implies, they're dressed almost like dolls, and the sight of them sparks gossip, hushed whispers, and flirtatious comments from passerby.
-   For Distracterella of _League of Super Redundant Heroes_, it's her main (and only) superpower. That, and wearing just Body Paint and pasties.
-   _Magick Chicks_ actually uses this as a plot point, concerning the reason so many girls lust after Faith: on a subconscious level, she wanted to be loved, so her psychic powers sync'd with the school to ensure she would be. Thus reshaping it in her image. In other words: Faith _quite literally_ oozes sex appeal.
-   In _Ménage à 3_, DiDi is a walking mass of breasts, lips and legs (especially breasts). Wherever she goes, whatever she does, all men are staring at her. Basically every character in the strip wants her or at least acknowledges her attractiveness.
-   _No Need for Bushido_ uses this line in regards to Matrix showing up in an actual nurses outfit here.
-   _Questionable Content_ references this trope in-universe when Faye goes to look something up for Sven and notices his browser history.
-   Both leads of _Reunion (2021)_:
    -   Rhea overhears comments about Shiro's good looks while they're at the diner together.
    -   Rhea's coworker notices that Rhea seems to attract customers to their store, and said customers are drawn with heart-eyes as Rhea serves them gelato.
-   Monique from _Sinfest_. She thoroughly enjoys the attention she gets most of the time, and isn't above using it either. However, she is occasionally distressed that men only want her for her body.
-   In _Weak Hero_, students start showing up at the pool hall just to get a look at the beautiful new part-time worker. Alex, Ben, and especially Gerard are quick to fall head over heels when they first meet her.

    Web Original 

-   Fey at the Super Hero School Whateley Academy in the _Whateley Universe_. Not only possessed of the beauty of the Sidhe, but also having a Faerie Glamour that (at the start of the series) she _cannot turn off_—though she later damps it down. Slightly.
-   Unshaved Mouse:
    -   When reviewing _Aladdin_ he describes Princess Jasmine as the World's Most Beautiful Woman, remarking that Aladdin notices her "since he's well, you know, ALIVE!"
        
        **Mouse:** I was going to say "straight", but even if he's gay... it's Jasmine.  
        **Ray Gillette:** Girl, please. No-one's _that_ gay.
        
    -   And then when reviewing _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_, Esmeralda is so beautiful she makes him forget all about Jasmine.
        
        **Jasmine:** Mouse? I can’t fight my feelings any more. I want you to take me, right here, right now...  
        **Mouse:** Hmm, what? Yeah, I think we have some in the fridge. I'm busy, Jasmine.
        
-   The "Distracted Boyfriend" meme, showing a man turning his head to look appreciatively at a woman walking past, to his girlfriend's outrage. Usually used to showcase fickle attention to something such as Fleeting Passionate Hobbies or Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!.

    Web Videos 

-   In _Return of the Cartoon Man_, Valerie becomes this type of character following her transformation.

    Western Animation 

-   Francine Smith in _American Dad!_. In the episode "Rubberneckers", Stan call in Francine as a witness and she arrives in a racy dress. As she walks towards the front, she catches the eye of every man present and Stan calls them on it.
-   _Animaniacs_:
    -   Former Trope Namer Hello Nurse is a sexy blonde assistant to the studio shrink<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  who inspires this reaction from both Yakko and Wakko. She's hardly the only woman on the show to do so however.
    -   A male nurse is also introduced at one point to get this reaction out of the Warner Sister, Dot, proving that this trope can indeed cross the gender barrier. Dot will also say the same when confronted with a Hunk or Pretty Boy - usually after complaining about the other two.
    -   Minerva Mink is the ultimate Ms. Fanservice on the show - drawing even more exaggerated reactions than Hello Nurse. She's also the prime example of the one guy she has the hots for not being interested.
    -   An episode that parodied _Star Trek_ had Not-Spock mindmeld with Wakko. The mindmeld caused Not!Spock to temporarily absorb some of Wakko's traits. When he sees Not!Uhura he immediately has this reaction.
-   _Arcane_: Caitlyn. As Vi puts it, "you're hot, cupcake". It takes very, very little effort for her to attract attention from anyone with a compatible orientation, which proves extremely useful when they need to investigate a brothel.
-   Poison Ivy in _Batman: The Animated Series_ makes everyone in the restaurant look at her as she leaves in the first episode she appears.
-   Huntress in _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_. She apparently fits this trope so well, that Blue Beetle can't stop drooling over her, even in the middle of combat. However, anytime he sees her in danger, it stirs him back into action.
-   Betty Boop got this reaction in most of her cartoons before the Hays Code kicked in.
-   Gadget Hackwrench in _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_ is a dorky Gadgeteer Genius Action Girl who is stunning with her beauty, although she rarely seems aware of that with her obsession with her engineering pursuits.
-   Nazz from _Ed, Edd n Eddy_ invokes this reaction from almost every male character. Often there is a time when the guys are fighting over her or bending over backwards to impress her, especially Eddy and Kevin (although it's implied that she and the latter ended up being an Official Couple). Aside from her beauty and usually upbeat personality, she may have been the most viable candidate for male attention due to the other choices are Sarah and the Kanker Sisters.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_:
    -   The Tooth fairy. She's so attractive, even Cosmo drools over her.
    -   Trixie, although Timmy's the only one in the show who seems attracted to her.
    -   Subverted with Princess Mandie. Despite her beauty, Mark and his people actually think that she's ugly.
-   _I Am Weasel_: Loulabelle, Weasel's assistant, who usually dresses as a nurse. Her debut was in the season 2 episode, "I.R. Mommy".
-   Referenced in _Moral Orel_, when Principal Fakey says "Hello Nurse!" to his love interest, Nurse Bendy.
-   One of the most famous animated examples is Red from _Red Hot Riding Hood_.
    -   _The Mask_ recreates the nightclub scene nearly in full, complete with _Looney Tunes_ effects. This is appropriate, since it is a "live-action cartoon".
    -   Red's Expie, Miss Vavoom from _Tom & Jerry Kids_ that usually appears in Droopy's shorts is also inspired by her. No wonder she makes everyone who see her have a Wild Take!
-   In _South Park_, Bebe gets this treatment for the episode "Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society". By the end of the episode, the boys realize they can't let breasts control them.
-   Smurfette in _The Smurfs (1981)_, after her magical makeover in the cartoon show, elicits this response in her fellow Smurfs. And in a single-page comic book gag, she actually became a nurse.
-   _Tripping the Rift_: On one planet, T'Nuk (since the locals REALLY like legs, and she's got four of them, "and no gag reflex"). She also claims to be considered this among her own species.
-   Emma Frost from _Wolverine and the X-Men (2009)_ has this reaction upon her introduction.
-   The title character from _Stripperella_. Whenever she dances at the strip club where she works, the men watching go crazy with lust. And at one point, a guy sitting next to the stage actually catches on fire because she's so hot. In another episode, Stripperella is being interviewed on a talk show, and the hostess repeatedly talks about how hot Striperella is and hints that she wants to have sex with her.
-   Circe from the _Hercules: The Animated Series_ episode "Hercules and the Song Of Circe" gets this reaction when she walks by, every male falls for her as soon as he spots her even the narrator, and she gets a line of men competing for her affection, the main plot kicks in when Hercules and his rival Adonis compete for her after she dumps his friend Icarus.
-   In _Steven Universe_, Stevonnie elicits this reaction from both Lars and Sadie during a night on the town and later gets invited to a rave by Sour Cream, who is flustered around them. Then there's the fact that Kevin attempts to flirt with Stevonnie at said rave.
-   The _Walter Lantz_ character Miss X who appeared in the two shorts "Abou Ben Boogie" and "The Greatest Man In Siam" gets this reaction when she enters the scene, "The Greatest Man In Siam" has every man in Arabia competing to be her husband.
-   Bubbles Blastoff from _The Jetsons_ episode “To Tell The Truth” every worker at Spacely Sprockets stops what they’re doing to stare at her when she passes by, often resulting in them getting hurt.
