Siblings working together as equal partners. Their business often involves ass-kicking. The easiest way to tell that a sibling duo/trio/quartet/etc. fits this trope is when they are most commonly referred as "the _Surname_ brothers", "the _Surname_ sisters", or "the _Surname_ siblings".

Brother–Sister Team is a Sub-Trope. Related tropes are Badass Family (for when the whole clan is in on the ass-kicking), Super Family Team (when the whole clan has superpowers), Unrelated Brothers (a Sibling Team in professional wrestling — who aren't actually related), Wonder Twin Powers (for twins with superpowers that only work in concert), and its more mundane Sister Trope (pun intended), Superior Twin Teamwork. Contrast Cain and Abel. Compare Parent-Child Team and Siblings in Crime.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Attack on Titan_ has this in the form of (apparent?) Big Bad Duumvirate Eren and Zeke Yeager, half-brothers leading an extremist faction responsible for assassinations and other actions against the military leadership. Their fanatical followers and public support make them dangerous enough, without the added dangers of their Titan powers and ability to use the Founding Titan when together. Keeping the brothers apart becomes the Survey Corps' top priority, fearing what will happen if they are able to carry out their ultimate goal.
-   _Cat's Eye_: The Kisugi sisters (Hitomi, Rui and Ai) are three Classy Cat Burglars who steal the works of art of their father to solve the mystery of his disappearance.
-   _Cyberpunk: Edgerunners_: Rebecca and her brother Pilar both work as mercs in Maine's gang.
-   _Delicious in Dungeon_ has Laios and Falin Touden, brother and sister dungeon crawlers.
-   _Digimon_:
    -   Matt and T.K from _Digimon Adventure_ are brothers. Tai's sister Kari later joins the Digidestined giving the team two sets of siblings.
    -   In _Digimon Tamers_, Henry's little sister Suzie gets a Digimon of her own, at first much to Henry's horror. Later we have Ai and Mako, Impmon's two Tamers making Tamers the second time we have two sets of Digidestined siblings.
    -   An episode of _Digimon Adventure 02_ had a villainous version of this tropes in the form of the Roachmon Brothers.
    -   _Digimon Frontier_: After he is freed from Cherubimon's corruption, Koichi joins the Digidestined alongside his brother.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   The Elric brothers. They are state alchemists. Even if Al is not officially a state alchemist, they are working together as equal partners on both government missions and their personal quest for the Philosopher's Stone.
    -   The homunculi are all brothers and sisters, especially so in the manga continuity and _Brotherhood_.
    -   The Slicer Brothers.
    -   In _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_, the Tringham brothers pose as the Elrics. They eventually become their allies.
-   Gohan and Goten in _Dragon Ball Z_ they even have their own Kamehameha.
-   The Kongo Twins of _Eyeshield 21_, though Agon gets far more attention then Unsui. There's also the Gonzales brothers of the Nasa Aliens.
-   _Fairy Tail_ gives us 'Demon' Mirajane, Elfman, and Lisanna. The team presumably breaks apart with the latter's death and Mirajane's retirement to Team Mom, but it later turns out that Lisanna isn't dead, and Mirajane recovers her ability to use magic, so they end up fighting alongside one another again. This is averted, though, when the S-Class Exams come and Elfman is chosen as a candidate, which means that he can choose Lisanna, who isn't a candidate, as a partner (Mirajane is already S-Class), but Lisanna instead volunteers to go with Juvia, assuming that Elfman had already teamed up with Evergreen. The Stellar Spirits Gemini are an example of Wonder Twin Powers.
-   Xia Yu sisters from _Full Metal Panic!_: assassins/spies. Also, Creepy Twins.
-   _Gundam_:
    -   The Frost Brothers of _Gundam X_ are twins with a Psychic Link that enables them to communicate telepathically no matter how far away from each other they are.
    -   There's The Zabis, Domon and Kyoji, although the latter is just a clone of the former's brother, Kira and Cagali and Team Trinity.
-   _Inuyasha_ and his half-brother Sesshoumaru do this several times later in the manga against Naraku.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   _Golden Wind_: Prosciutto and Pesci, both members of the hitman team.
    -   _The JoJoLands_: Jodio and his older brother Dragona work together on various courier duties to support their mother, while on the flip side commit crimes to earn extra money.
-   Though they started out as deadly enemies that didn't know their true relationship, Ryuko Matoi and Satsuki Kiryuin from _Kill la Kill_ eventually join forces and blossom into one of these.
-   _Kindergarten Wars_: The brothers Natsuki and Haruo work together, be it for running their fishing shop or for their side business as assassins.
-   N2R from _Lyrical Nanoha_, a unit made up of four of the Nakajima Sisters, namely Nove, Wendi, Dieci, and Cinque.
    -   All twelve Numbers are sisters and a Badass Family and usually fight in teams. Uno was the Mission Control sister who is out of combat, and Sein was usually the back-up sister who helped the others if they are in trouble. Some of them formed duos, like Nove and Wendi, Quattro and Dieci, Otto and Deed, and Tre and Sette, but a third sister can join them, like Deed joined Nove and Wendi during the Grand Finale. Shortly before, there were three trios, Wendi, Otto and Deed, Tre, Sette and Nove, and Quattro, Dieci and Sein. Cinque usually has no regular partners and can fight alone, but she gave a villainous You Shall Not Pass! to protect her sisters Nove and Wendi, and she was in a team with Tre and Quattro eight years before the start of the season. The only Number who worked alone was Due, because she was an undercover agent in secret missions, and the only sister who had contact with her was Uno.
    -   Also, the Liese Twins from _A's_, although they are twin familiars rather than a real family.
    -   Erio and Caro are the adopted variant, and they never fight without the other until in _ViVid_. They're also a Battle Couple.
-   Kouji and Tetsuya from _Mazinger Z_ and _Great Mazinger_ are adoptive brothers and Humongous Mecha pilots. When they are actually fighting their enemy instead of each other, they are a force to be reckoned with.
    -   Tetsuya and Jun from _Great Mazinger_ are also adoptive siblings. They overlap this trope with Battle Couple.
    -   Duke and Maria from _UFO Robo Grendizer_.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Gaara, Kankuro, and Temari. Early on in the series, they were actually closer to a deconstruction of this trope; Temari and Kankuro were both out right terrified of Gaara and only followed him out of a mix of obligation and fear. It isn't until post Time Skip that they start following the spirit of this trope.
    -   When Sasuke and Itachi meet again after Edo Tensei brought the latter back, the two team up against Kabuto.
-   _Oishinbo_ has a pair of twin brothers who run a very successful shop together. When they decided to split up, the quality of their ramen significantly declined.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   The characters Ace and Luffy though not biological brothers, think of themselves as siblings, and are very close. They seem to be able to predict each other's moves, and from seeing them battle together in the Marineford War, (and from the filler episodes) it's known they have been fighting together for years. They also shared this bond with their other adopted brother, Sabo.
    -   The Square Sisters Mozu and Kiwi, both are skilled Swordswomen.
    -   There are also the DeCalvan Brothers, a pair of pirate captains and two of Whitebeard's most trusted men; and Bobby and Kelly Funk, bounty hunters who can defeat supernova-level pirates. (The latter pair is named after Terry Funk and Dory Funk Jr., as seen below.)
    -   The Vinsmoke siblings Reiju, Ichiji, Niji and Yonji. They even have a Combination Attack, Their brother Sanji averts this wanting nothing to do with them.
        -   However, in the anime, Sanji and Reiju do team up against villainous sibling team Charlotte Oven, Daifuku and Smoothie during The Tea Party.
-   The Hitachiin brothers from _Ouran High School Host Club_ are more or less inseparable twins and often partners in crime. They've also been shown beating up punks together.

-   Natsumi and Kurumi in the _Ranma ½_ OAV, _The One To Carry On._ The former uses a rug beater to project razor-sharp freezing winds, while the other uses a hair ribbon several yards long to channel burning ki. The two sisters even have a Finishing Move Combination Attack that uses both aspects to blast their enemies away.
    -   From the late manga, the sisters Pink and Link, who nearly poisoned the entire town.
    -   In the anime, Shampoo's childhood friends Rinrin and Ranran.
    -   From the first movie, the brothers Daikokusei and Daihakusei of the Seven Lucky Gods.
    -   As a note, the three previous Sibling Teams are all twins. Seems like you can't be twins in this series without being part of a battle team.
-   _Rebuild World_: Reina's Ninja Maid bodyguards Shiori and Kanae, in a Red Oni, Blue Oni dynamic together, as well as Freudian Trio dynamic when combined with Reina.
-   Anita King, Maggie Mui, Michelle Cheung a.k.a. The Paper Sisters in _R.O.D the TV_.
-   Ikki and Shun from _Saint Seiya_ at first started off as Cain and Abel. Finally in the last movie, Tenkai Hen~ Overture, they finally worked together. If you go by the manga, you could say that this had been happening for a long time since all the bronze Saints are half brothers with Shun and Ikki being the only full-brothers of the group.
-   The twins Tsuruba and Tariga Bergatt in _Snow White with the Red Hair_ are master swordsmen who grew up fighting alongside each other, to the point that when they do split up to take out their brother they state it's the first time either of them has ever fought without the other.
-   _Soul Eater_: The Thompson Sisters (possibly named for both the machine gun and the Thompson Twins). In their backstory they were criminals, until they met Death The Kid and became his partners. Liz and Patti end up working together as meister and Weapon when Kid gets imprisoned by Noah. Patti is a _menace_ as Liz's meister.
-   In _Tamagotchi_, the Spacy Brothers are a villainous example. The trio work together to one day take over Tamagotchi Planet (not that any of their attempts are successful).
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: The Black Siblings, who are the three sisters (oldest to youngest), Kiyoh, Kinon and Kiyal, and their older brother/leader Kittan. They work as Beastman hunters together until they're incorporated into Team Dai-Gurren, after which their teamwork is less direct, with Kinon becoming a Bridge Bunny while the other three are mecha pilots. On other hand, Kittan and Kiyal become a closer team with their mecha, with the Kiyalunga transforming into a shield and lance for the King Kittan.

-   Abo and Kado, two brothers employed by Freeza who struck out on their own following his death in _Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!_.

    Asian Animation 

-   In _Boonie Bears_, Briar and Bramble are bear brothers who work together to make sure Logger Vick doesn't destroy the forest they live in.
-   The eponymous characters in _Doby & Disy_ are, respectively, a brother and sister who work together to help those around them.
-   _Happy Heroes_: By technicality, the five main Supermen are all siblings since they were all formed from Jixie Stones at the same time (with the exception of Careful S., who comes later). They work together to fight monsters.
-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_: Rolly and Raoul are two brothers who dream of being musicians together. They always work together to achieve goals. A villainous example since they're both wolves.

    Comic Books 

-   During the rare periods when they're both alive, sane and in the same reality, Northstar and Aurora of _Alpha Flight_ serve as a sibling team.
-   _The Avengers_: Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are nothing short of this. They are in fact twins and have a very long history together, either as Magneto's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants or the Avengers.
-   The _Batman_ comics seem to be trying to get some mileage out of the fact that Bruce Wayne has three adopted sons, a biological son, an alternate universe biological daughter, and (before the New 52 benched her) an adopted daughter:
    -   Nightwing (Dick) and Robin (Tim) teamed up rather often, and when Dick stepped in for Batman the first time the two of them worked together as Batman and Robin.
    -   After Bruce Wayne's "death," the new Batman and Robin were brothers by adoption Dick Grayson and Damian Wayne.
    -   _Batman: Gates of Gotham_ is built on this trope, with the sibling dynamic between Batman, Robin, Red Robin, and Black Bat juxtaposed against the sibling dynamic of the Gates brothers in the back story.
    -   The _War of the Robins_ arc of the rebooted _Batman and Robin_ ends with a team up of the three Robin brothers, and Tim who is not their brother in the new continuity though he was prior to the reboot.
    -   _Red Hood and the Outlaws_ and _Teen Titans_ were both rebooted by Scott Lobdell, and he seems to have taken the opportunity to establish that Jason Todd and Tim Drake, while still having some fundamental disagreements about things like killing, have a degree of respect for each other and share information.
-   The Fantastic Four consist of the Invisible Woman, her younger brother, the Human Torch. Also Sue's husband, Mr. Fantastic, and former beau, the Thing. In the next generation, there's Sue's children, Franklin and Valeria.
-   _Khaal: The Chronicles of a Galactic Emperor_ features a Villain Protagonist variant with Khaal, Dalym and Shyl, who use their combined powers to rise to power for control of a prison spaceship. Khaal eventually becomes the most dominant one ruling on his own right, but he is still dependent on his brothers to draw their powers.
-   Joe, William, Jack and Averell Dalton in _Lucky Luke_.
-   Alex and Freddy, the titular main characters from _Mega Robo Bros_.
-   In _Motu Patlu_, Motu and Patlu are a sibling duo who work together to solve whatever problem comes their way. The Nickelodeon India TV show changes this so that they are friends instead of brothers.
-   The Double Dare sisters from _Nightwing_.
-   _Power Pack_: Four siblings — two boys and two girls.
-   The Relative Heroes of the DCU are all orphaned siblings, two of whom were biological and three of whom were adopted by their parents. They took off after their parents died in order to prevent the family from being split up and the fact that several of them had superpowers and a strong sense of right and wrong means that they started working as a hero group.
-   _Spider-Girl_ plays with this a lot. Fitting for a 'verse made up of Legacy Heroes.
    -   Crazy Eight and Funny Face, a villainous example. Until Crazy Eight's death. Their boss is their mother, Angel Face.
    -   May also teams up with two annoying younger kids in spider costumes, but she's not really related to either of them.
    -   However, there is her clone April and cousin Darkdevil, both of whom she's worked with.
-   _Spider-Man_: Though they're not brothers in the traditional sense, Peter Parker has _his_ clones: Ben Reilly, the first Scarlet Spider, and Kaine Parker, the second. The _Ultimate Marvel_ world's Peter Parker has his Opposite-Sex Clone Jessica Drew.
-   The Brothers Grimm from _Spider-Woman_ also fulfill the role as well, as villains, of course.
-   In _Super Sons_, Jon and Damian are frequently mistaken for one due to their similar ages and hair colors. It's a Running Gag how Jon is almost always assumed to be the older of the two simply because he's taller.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_: It's never discussed if they're blood related or not, however the titular turtles are a group of brothers who fight together.
-   _Wonder Woman_: Diana and Donna are sometimes sisters, and usually at least _sworn_ sisters, who work together as Wonder Woman and Wonder Girl.
-   Siblings rarely seem to work together as teams in the _X-Men_ generally. Cyclops and Havok have attempted this on occasion, which never lasts long. The same goes for Colossus and Magik, for Cannonball, Husk and the other Guthrie kids, and for Karma and her late brother Tran. Professor X and his stepbrother Juggernaut even wound up as arch-enemies, and his "sister"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Cassandra Nova is the X-Men's _worst nightmare._

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: Although it's difficult at first, the two halves of the hybrid Titan created by San reviving and ultimately merging with Vivienne Graham (an act which, by Ghidorah's standards, makes them siblings) learn to work together as equals.
    -   _Abraxas: Empty Fullness_ also shows that the three Dorat brothers who became Ghidorah were a team who looked out for each-other and worked together before they were turned into Ghidorah and they snapped.
-   _Relic Of The Future_: Having had a different, much kinder upbringing in the alternate universe, Weiss and Whitley Schnee are significantly closer than their canon selves initially were in the show, both have unlocked their Semblances (something Whitley hasn't yet done in the show), and they're clearly used to working combatively in a pair after being trained by Winter.
-   _Digimon Codex_: The Wingdramon and Breakdramon training under the Royal Knights are both brothers, who were both originally Dracomon and Digivolved into Coredramon Blue and Green at the same time. They have both been trained by the Royal Knights to DNA Digivolve into the Royal Knight Examon once they are both Megas. However, Wingdramon confesses that he is holding off on becoming a Mega for as long as possible, due to DNA Digivolving causing one of the Digimon to suffer a Death of Personality when done with Wild Digimon, and wanting to protect his brother Breakdramon since he volunteered to be the one who dies. Thanks to Flash though, Breakdramon is able to DNA Digivolve with a mindless scan of Slayerdramon into Examon, and he tells Wingdramon he can Digivolve into a UlforceVeedramon on his own, thus allowing the two brothers to both become Royal Knights and fight side by side together.
-   An odd case in _Dungeon Keeper Ami_. Ami and Tiger, who are not sisters, siblings, blood relations, or of the same _species_. Magical misshap, however, has made them similar in both appearance and mannerism. Later, Tiger is formally adopted into the Mizuno family, playing this trope straighter.

-   The _Harmony's Warriors_ series has a side story featuring Pinkie Pie (a spy in this universe) going on a mission with her sister and fellow spy Marble. It also seems that when Pinkamena was the dominant personality, she tended to do assassin jobs with Limestone.
-   _Invader Zim: A Bad Thing Never Ends_: Dib and Gaz, building off their bonding in _Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus_, now spend a lot of time working together to fight Zim and stop his plans.
-   _MLP Next Generation: Know Fear!_ has Lazarus and Lara, the griffon brother and sister who serve as Shadow Wing's chief Pretender agents.
-   The _Mass Effect_ and _Pacific Rim_ crossover _Hunters of Death_ has John and Jane Shepard, usually fighting as a team either on the ground or in a giant robot as copilots
-   _Soul Eater: Troubled Souls_ has quite a few examples. The most prominent one is Tsuji and Rowena Ricardsen, twin sister and brother who work very well together. The next are Vincent, Autumn, and Damon Vanderbilt - unlike the mentioned twins (bot weapon technicians), these triplets are Meister and Weapons. After them are Meredith and Olmett, again Meister and Weapon, who are probably more skilled than even the aforementioned.
-   The _Frozen_ and _Pacific Rim_ crossover _Arctic Rim_ has Anna and Elsa in such a team.
-   _The New Adventures of Invader Zim_ has Dib's new teammates, the twins Steve and Viera.
-   In _Let Me Hear_, the team RWBY consists of two sibling teams combined into one: half-sisters Ruby and Yang, together with adopted sisters Blake and Weiss. They train together as one team at Beacon Academy.
-   In _NUMB3RS_ story _Twas a Dark and Stormy Night_, the three Duckett sisters work together to steal art from museums and sell them on the black market.
-   _The Palaververse_: _The Motion of the Stars_ has "Now it falls on two sisters to reclaim what they can." ending its short description, as they're the protagonists.
-   _Son of the Sannin_ has Naruto's adopted younger brother and sister Hagane and Kaida who are placed on the same team when they graduate from the academy. The third member of their team (Hanabi) is not their sibling, though she's basically an in-law since her older sister Hinata and Naruto had already been dating for a few years by the time the team formed and are married by the time of the epilogue.
-   In _Twinkling in the Dark_, Nao/Cure March's younger sister Haru becomes Cure August, and the two of them team up to fight Wolfrun.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Brave_: The triplets. How else can they pull off a Human Ladder or their more complex pranks but working together?

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues a.k.a. _The Blues Brothers_. However, they're not biologically related - they became _blood_ brothers while growing up together in the orphanage which the film centers around saving, and took the Blues name as adults.
-   Connor and Murphy McManus, _The Boondock Saints_.
-   The Bagrov brothers from _Brother (1997)_, but especially the second movie.
-   _Four Brothers_: Four adopted brothers team up to avenge their mother's death.
-   _Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters_, obviously.
-   Blue, Charlie, Delta, and Echo, the raptor sisters of _Jurassic World_. It's noted in the earlier films that _Velociraptors_ are pack animals, so Owen raises the four sisters together and trains them to healthily function as an effective and loyal pack. A side bonus to this is that Owen has the Undying Loyalty and unwavering obedience of a pack of dangerous predators, as they consider him their alpha. This is in stark contrast to the _I. rex_, who was raised in complete isolation and ate her own sibling.
-   _The Legend of Frenchie King_: Louise is the famous outlaw Frenchie King and her gang consists of her four half-sisters.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   Thor and Loki manage to fulfill both this trope _and_ Cain and Abel, mostly due to circumstances forcing them into Enemy Mine. Despite the considerable friction between them, they actually work quite well together, flawlessly pulling off a clever subterfuge in _Thor: The Dark World_, and taking out numerous Mooks and their sister Hela (via Surtur) in _Thor: Ragnarok_.
    -   Wanda and Pietro Maximoff adore and support each other in _Avengers: Age of Ultron_ and kick ass together no matter which side they're on.
    -   Gamora and Nebula team up in _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_ and _Avengers: Endgame_, their adoptive brothers Ebony Maw and Obsidian Cull similarly team up against the Avengers in _Avengers: Infinity War_ though unlike the former sisters they don't much for each other.
-   The creepy albino twins from _The Matrix Reloaded_.
-   Turk and Virgil Malloy from _Ocean's Eleven_.
-   In _Pacific Rim_, since the co-pilots need to work together well enough to operate the Jaegers, it's understandable to see sibling teams. The original pilots for Gipsy Danger were the brothers Raleigh and Yancy Becket. The Wei Tang Triplets are another example, along with the identical twin brothers of Romeo Blue.
-   The Borden Twins in _The Prestige_, who live their lives as one person for the sake of their magic act.
-   _The Raid 2: Berandal_ has Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man.
-   _So Close_: Is about two sisters that work together as assassins.
-   The clone army from _Star Wars_ could be an example. All the clones grow up together, at any rate, and individual troopers have other troopers that they are especially close to. If not, the four-man commando squads, as in _Star Wars: Republic Commando_, definitely count.
-   The Stabbington brothers in _Tangled_.
-   _Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen_:
    -   We got the sisters Arcee, Chromia and Elita-1 according to the merchandise. (The movie itself has all three answer to the name, seeming to be one character with three bodies. The comic books split the difference with a Stepford cuckoos\-type link.
    -   Skids and Mudflap count, too. Two twins who help each other and the Autobots to fight the Deceptions, Simmons against Devastator and help Sam to revive the Matrix... when they don't argue with each other.
-   Trinity and Bambino, the "right and left hand of The Devil", respectively, in the _Trinity_ series of Western films (played by Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, no less). Though Bambino isn't particularly happy about having a brother like that, they make one hell of a team when they join forces.

    Literature 

-   The Geste brothers in _Beau Geste_.
-   Monza and Benna in Joe Abercrombie's _Best Served Cold_ make a very efficient Sibling Team — he's the people person, she's the one who fights. Together, they lead a band of mercenaries. It's implied that they are closer than most siblings.
-   Phury and Zsadist from the _Black Dagger Brotherhood_.
-   Most Enid Blyton protagonist groups are at least partially family-based. The Famous Five consist of three siblings, their cousin and her dog, the 'Adventure' group are two pairs of a brother and a sister, etc.
-   Niko and _Cal Leandros_. They even have a monster hunting agency.
-   The Pevensies, the main characters of the first few books of _The Chronicles of Narnia_, are brothers and sisters. Later, Susan and Peter opt out and cousin Eustace comes in.

-   _Diary of a Wimpy Kid_: _The Meltdown_ has the Marlee sisters, who live in Greg's neighborhood and will attack anybody or anything that comes into their yard.
-   The Brothers Majere in _Dragonlance_, at least, to start with.
-   Half-brothers Harry Dresden and Thomas Raith in _The Dresden Files_, wizard and vampire respectively.
-   _The Hardy Boys_ have been one of the most famous examples in literature since the 1920s, as brothers one year apart in age who are both partners in solving crimes and catching bad guys together as well as inseparable best friends and Heterosexual Life-Partners.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   The Weasley twins and their joke shop.
    -   Source material reveals this to be the flip-side of the "twin-core effect" first introduced in _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_. Not only do wands with twin cores not work properly against each other, but they power each other up when their wielders fight side-by-side. And to reinforce this, one instance of this effect occurred when said wielders actually were brothers — Chadwick and Webster Boot.
-   _The Iliad_:
    -   Teucer and Greater Ajax are half brothers, with Teucer being the bastard.
    -   Agamemnon and Menelaus, the leaders of the Greek alliance.
    -   On the Trojan side, most of Priam's sons.
-   _Jinx and The Doom Fight Crime_ is a children's picture book about a brother and sister who once fought each other but have since started using their imaginations to have adventures fighting crime.
-   In _Johannes Cabal the Necromancer_ Cabal recruits his brother, Horst, a vampire to help him run his diabolic carnival-he even had his minions paint the carnival's train with 'Cabal Bros.' _before_ Horst had agreed, wanting to be prepared. There is mgore of this in the fourth book in the series, aptly (and somewhat punnily) titled The Brothers Cabal.
-   Rory and Coco in _Little League Family._ Rory catches and Coco pitches. As pitcher-catcher are almost a subteam in baseball, that makes them a literal as well as metaphorical team.
-   Georgia and Shaun Mason in Mira Grant's _Feed_ are adopted, but every bit as close as blood siblings (they don't like to be apart, ever). They work together on their blog network and watch each other's backs when they go into infected zones.
-   In the Modesty Blaise novel _The Night of Morningstar_, there's a notorious pair of Professional Killers known as the Polish Twins, who are actual twin brothers (identical twins, naturally). "Polish" is their nationality, not their surname; most of the people who spread their notoriety aren't willing to tackle pronouncing "the Zdrzalkywicz twins".
-   _Princesses of the Pizza Parlor_: In _Princesses Don't Do Summer School_, out of the three-bandit group fought by the princessess, at least two of them are brothers, an older one and a younger one.
-   The _Redwall_ novel _Triss_ features triplet adders who have been chained together since hatchlinghood, as an enemy their mother battled managed to tangle a mace around their tails and since they don't have hands they couldn't remove it. They learned to move together as one, hunting as a team, and basically became a non-supernatural version of a hydra.
-   In the _Saga Of Ragnar Lothbrok_, the sons of Aslaug and Ragnar Lothbrok—Ivar the Boneless, Bjorn Ironside, Hvitserk, and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye — make a glorious career as sea-raiders and conquerors acting as a team. In fact, they are always victorious when they fight by side, but every time they do not all stand together they suffer a defeat.
-   The Baudelaire siblings in _A Series of Unfortunate Events_. They're all pretty much equally intelligent and resourceful, and contribute more or less equally to solving the problems of each book, though they do each have specific areas of expertise, with Violet being a Gadgeteer Genius, Klaus being a Badass Bookworm, and Sunny's sharp teeth giving her a Buzzsaw Jaw.
-   Sabrina and Daphne, the eponymous heroines of _The Sisters Grimm_.
-   _Star Wars Legends_:
    -   _Hand of Thrawn_: If clones count, the so-called Devist family, that sleeper cell of cloned Imperial pilots who become Farm Boys, and are insular and _very_ close because of Clone Angst and Fantastic Racism.
    -   In _Young Jedi Knights_, the Solo Twins Jacen and Jaina. Once they're out of their teens they quickly stop being together all the time, and, well, we know how it ended.
-   The _Swallows and Amazons_ series is mostly about multiple Sibling Crews interacting with each other.
-   Tolkien's Legendarium:
    -   The sons of Fëanor from _The Silmarillion_.
    -   And Elrond's twin sons, who get very little mention in _The Lord of the Rings_.
    -   In _The Hobbit_, Thorin's company is made up of sibling teams of Dwarves.
-   Lois McMaster Bujold's _Vorkosigan Saga_:
    -   Miles and Mark Vorkosigan.
    -   And, to a lesser extent, Delia, Martya, Olivia, and Kareen, a/k/a Team Koudelka.
-   MudWings in _Wings of Fire_ work in sibling groups by nature. They're not raised by their parents. Instead, the first hatched dragonet (known as the "bigwings") helps their siblings out of their eggs and from then on they work together. MudWings are reluctant to let "unsibs" into their groups.
-   From _A Wrinkle in Time_, there's Meg and Charles Wallace Murry. Calvin O'Keefe, who just gets pulled along for the ride, isn't related to the Murrys. Yet, anyway.
    -   Same goes for Sandy and Dennys, the Murry twins in _Many Waters._

-   _Dancing with the Stars_ had two sets in the Houghs (Derek and Julianne) and the Chmerkovskiys (Maks and Val).
-   _Frasier_ and Niles Crane automatically team up for anything; from schemes to snag Frasier a date to elaborate, convoluted escapades that end up with them both being accidentally arrested for murder. The fact that they meet at least once a day to complain about their problems and beg the other to help them out contributes to this greatly, while neither the fact that their Sibling Rivalry frequently interferes with their teamwork, nor several dozen chewing-outs from their father for blowing things, has never stopped them. It gets Lampshaded when Frasier and Niles admit to making short stories called "The Crane Boys Adventures" in the style of _Nancy Drew_ and _The Hardy Boys_.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Jon Snow and his sister Sansa Stark become this, effectively leading a Northern army to retake Winterfell from Ax-Crazy Ramsay Bolton. Considering how many betrayals and deaths their family has suffered since the very first episode of Season 1, it's incredibly satisfying to see the Stark children, even if it's only two of them, come together to fight for themselves and their home.
    -   Downplayed with the direwolves. Only Summer and Shaggydog got to work together. The rest of the direwolves end up being separated into different storylines.
    -   Downplayed with House Baratheon. Due to circumstance and perhaps owing to their mutual dislike, all three Baratheon brothers never really had the chance to fight side-by-side in any major conflict. Renly was too young when Stannis followed Robert into war against the Targaryens, and both Stannis and Renly were stuck in Storm's End for almost the entirety of the rebellion. Renly was absent once again on the battlefield during the Greyjoy Rebellion, when Stannis fought under Robert as commander of the Royal Fleet, smashing the Greyjoy armada and pacifying Great Wyk island while Robert took the capital of Pyke. On a less martial note however, all three Baratheon brothers did sit on the royal council during Robert's reign and ruled the Seven Kingdoms together, with Renly as Master of Laws and Stannis as Master of Ships.

-   Elsewhere in the spandex vs. People in Rubber Suits genre, _Kamen Rider Dragon Knight_ has the villainous Cho brothers, better known as Kamen Riders Axe and Spear. this leads to Axe going on a revenge kick once Spear is eliminated. Presumably, this goes for their mirror world counterparts as well.
-   The 1985 Tokusatsu series, _Kyodai Ken Byclosser_. The eponymous heroes are sibling team consisting of two brothers, Ken and Gin.
-   Half-sisters Morgana and Morgause from _Merlin_. An aversion with Morgana and Arthur, as by the time they realize they are half-siblings, they are estranged.

-   Don and Charlie Eppes work together to pursue evildoers on _NUMB3RS_. Don is an FBI agent and Charlie is The Smart Guy math consultant.
-   _Power Rangers_ never has an _all-_sibling team, because that would result in Monochrome Casting and PR always has a multiracial team. However, two members of teams have been siblings on a number of occasions:
    -   Subverted way back in _Power Rangers Zeo_: It's _heavily implied_ that Tommy's half-brother David is the Gold Ranger. He isn't. It's also teased that he will assume the powers. He doesn't.
    -   _Power Rangers Lost Galaxy_: Leo, the Red Ranger, and Mike, the Magna Defender, or so it seems at first. But it's complicated. Eventually it is played straight after the original Magna Defender sacrifices himself, moves on to the afterlife and Mike, whom he'd merged with previously before separating from, gets to take up his mantle for the rest of the franchise.
    -   _Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue_ has Dana the Pink Ranger and Ryan the _Power Rangers_\-exclusive Titanium Ranger. The commander is their dad, as in Go Go V. With the bad guys, only one is the son of Queen Bansheera.
    -   The Thunder Rangers (Blake and Hunter Bradley) from _Power Rangers Ninja Storm_. (The two were both _adopted_ by the Bradleys, but that doesn't matter in the slightest.)
    -   _Power Rangers Mystic Force_ doesn't have Magiranger's all-sibling team, but keeps the family dynamic alive with sisters Vida and Madison, the Pink and Blue Rangers. And Nick's whole Luke, I Am Your Father situation, but that's neither here nor there.

-   The heroes of _Stranger Things_ include three sets of siblings: Mike and Nancy Wheeler, Jonathan and Will Byers, and Lucas and Erica Sinclair. Downplayed, as the siblings often get split up into different Cast Herds, but in the end, they all work together to keep the world safe from the Upside Down.
-   Although they're aren't biologically related, Supergirl/Kara and her adoptive Cool Big Sis, Alex qualify as this.
-   The Winchester brothers from _Supernatural_.

-   _Ultra Series_
    -   Ultraman Leo and his brother Astra. While the two only teamed up on occasion in Leo's own show, they're nearly inseparable in later appearances.
    -   This is one of the big selling points of _Ultraman R/B_. The series features Ultraman brothers Rosso and Blu fighting together battling kaiju together every episode. This extends to their humans hosts, brothers Katsumi and Isami Minato.
-   Damon and Stefan Salvatore occasionally team up on _The Vampire Diaries_.
-   _The White Queen_: Eldest and youngest brothers King Edward IV and Richard of Gloucester work in unison to maintain the former's reign over England, navigating the murky politics of a Decadent Court and fighting alongside on the battlefield.

    Myths & Religion 

-   A common trope in pre-Columbian America involves twins doing this.
-   Classical Mythology abounds in this. Some examples:
    -   Brothers Hades, Poseidon and Zeus rule the world together under the leadership of the youngest, Zeus. They drew lots to decide who gets what apart from the Earth: Zeus got the sky, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the underworld.
    -   Zeus also forms a God Couple with his sister Hera.
    -   Twins Artemis and Apollo (children of Zeus and Leto) frequently work together, for instance as death deities — Apollo targeting men with his arrows, Artemis women. Later, Artemis became goddess of the Moon and Apollo god of the Sun.
    -   Apollo's son Asclepius, the god of healing, had several children by different wives. Most of his sons became famous healers, while his five daughters — Hygieia, Panacea, Aceso, Iaso and Aglaea — are all personifications of aspects of healing and good health.
    -   Arts and sciences were the province of the nine Muses (daughters of Zeus and the Titaness Mnemosyne) and their half-brother Apollo.
    -   Before Apollo and Artemis usurped their roles, the Sun and Moon were charges of siblings Helios and Selene. Their sister Eos is better known as Rose-Fingered Dawn.
    -   The Fates are conventionally described as three sisters (Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos), although the myths are far from unanimous as to their parentage.
    -   Castor and Polydeuces, twin half-brothers. Eventually turned into the (Greek version of) the constellation Gemini.
    -   Amphion and Zethos, twin sons of Zeus and Antiope.
    -   Idas and Lynceus, inseparable sons of Aphareus of Messene and his wife Arene, although it was believed that Idas' real father was Poseidon.
    -   Heracles and his nephew Iolaos.
-   In Roman mythology you have Romulus and Remus, twin sons of the priestess Rhea Silvia and the god Mars (Ares) and founders of Rome. It did not end well.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   The gimmick of identical twins who can win matches because they look so much alike they can switch places in the ring without their opponent, or more appropriately, the referee realizing it is a very common one.
    -   Ron and Don Harris, who worked both in WCW and WWE under various gimmicks including The Blu Brothers, the Disciples of Apocalypse, and Creative Control.
    -   The Bella Twins, Nikki and Brie.
    -   The Shane Twins, best known as the Gymini in WWE and The Johnsons in early TNA.
    -   Shu and Kei Sato, two Japanese wrestlers whose gimmick changed from pop singing sailors to Hindu occultists.
    -   Charlie Haas and his brother Russ, although Russ sadly passed away at a young age while in OVW
    -   The Briscoe Brothers were **thirteen time** ROH Tag Team Champions, and would probably be holding that title today had Jay not been killed in a car accident in January 2023.
    -   Then new terrors to OVW's women's division, The Blossom Twins.
    -   The Samoan Soldiers, perhaps better known as The Usos. (Incidentally, their father Rikishi also has a twin brother in the business.)
-   The longest running example being _**The Brothers of Destruction**_, consisting of The Undertaker and Kane who have been together off & on from 1998 - 2019. They've fought against each other as often as they've teamed together, but despite their spats, they always made up & came together again, being the only family each has left.
-   Dory Funk Jr. and his brother Terry.
-   Raymond and Jacques Rougeau.
-   The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott).
-   Los Hermanos Guerrero: Mando, Eddie and Chavo<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in the Mexican World Wrestling Association. Chavo and Héctor were United States Tag Team Champions in the National Wrestling Alliance too.
-   The entire Von Erich Family (Kerry, Kevin, Mike, Chris and David - and sometimes father Fritz) would team in various combinations in World Class in the 80s.
-   Los Hermanos Dinamita Cien Caras and Máscara Año Dos Mil, who were Mexico's National Tag Tam/Pareja Champions during the 1980s. Their other brother, Universo Dos Mil, would help them become National Trios Champions in the 1990s.
-   Bret and Owen Hart who had a short lived, but memorable tag team run. Other combinations of Hart brothers (of the 8 Hart brothers _**seven**_ became wrestlers, and the eighth was a referee<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) formed tag teams at various points.
    -   Bret and Owen were joined by older brothers Bruce (Stu Hart's second child) and Keith (Stu's third child, Bret and Owen were the 8th and 12th children, respectively) to defeat Shawn Michaels<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and three masked nights at _Survivor Series_ 1993.
-   Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray)
-   The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff Hardy)
-   Carlito and Primo Colón.
-   Matt and Nick Jackson, The Young Bucks. Sometimes their other brother, CK Jackson, joins in on the fun too.
-   Cody Rhodes and Goldust
-   Shane McMahon and Stephanie McMahon control WWE Raw and WWE SmackDown before brand split
-   The Medrano sisters, Ashley and Elizabeth, aka Team Sea Stars, Ashley Vox and Delmi Exo.
-   Lucha Brothers (Pentagón Jr. and Rey Fenix)

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_: The planeswalker Ajani Goldmane and his late brother J'zall were a nigh unbeatable team. J'zall was their tribe's leader and strongest warrior, and Ajani's special brand of magic could make him even stronger.
-   _Warhammer_:
    -   _Blood Bowl_: The Swift Brothers, Lucien and Valen, are a pair of Elven twins who, since reconciling with each other after a long running feud, have refused to play for any team individually. As a Star Blitzer and Thrower who have been practicing together for more than a century, the pair combine into a strong team with the only downside being the cost of hiring them (only Morg 'n' Thorg is more expensive).
    -   _Warhammer 40,000_:
        -   The pilot and gunner of Eldar Viper Jetbike teams consist of psychically-linked twin-sibling teams for better coordination.
        -   An Eldar Wraithknight is a very special case of this, as it is piloted by a team consisting of identical twins, one living and the other dead.
        -   The Corsairs of the Sunblitz Brotherhood are led by brother triplets instead of by a single captain.
        -   The Primarchs Alpharius and Omegon led the Alpha Legion of Space Marines together throughout the Great Crusade (and might still be in charge despite one or the other being declared dead multiple times).
    -   _Warhammer Fantasy_:
        -   Naestra and Arahan are a pair of mystically separated aspects of the same elf, rather than sisters, but they behave like twins for all intents and purposes. The pair always fight together from the back of their mighty forest dragon Ceithin-Har.
        -   The High Elf identical twins Tyrion and Teclis often fight together, especially in times of great peril, but just as often operate apart.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Kamaitachi, Kamanitachi and Kamamitachi of the Yosenju archetype are anthropomorphic weasel brothers with a kamaitachi theme

    Video Games 

-   _Ace Attorney_: Apollo Justice and his half-sister Trucy Wright, though this isn't revealed until the end of the fourth game and the two of them aren't even aware of it.
-   _Arcana Heart_: The Kasuga Family consists of four Miko sisters that fight together with Maori as head.
-   _Assassin's Creed Syndicate_ has the two playable protagonists, twins Jacob and Evie Frye.
-   Played with in the _Backyard Sports_ series:
    -   The straight examples are the Webber twins and the Khans. Ashley and Sidney Webber are mediocre whenever they play separately. When you put them on the same team, watch out. Amir Khan steps up whenever he plays alongside his big brother Achmed.
    -   Inverted with the Delvecchios. Angela and Tony both get major stat boosts if they are playing against each other.
    -   Subverted if you put Ronny Dobbs on the same team as his sister Sally. His stats will drop like lead balloons.
    -   Averted with the Kawaguchis. If you put Kenny and Vicki on the same team, their stats won't be affected.
-   _Balacera Brothers_ stars Harold and Benny Balacera (player 1 and 2 respectively), two brothers fighting an undead invasion with their Tommy Guns.
-   _Battle for Wesnoth_: Ro'Sothian and Ro'Arthian from _Northern Rebirth_ are brothers and beast-controlling liches, who fight trespassing dwarves together so they can rest in peace, and later, to help Tallin in exchange for not being disturbed anymore.
-   _Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood_: The McCall brothers, adventurers and robbers.
-   _Chantelise_: Chante and Elise are sisters, on a journey to free Chante from the curse that transformed her into a fairy. It turns out that the "witch's curse" does this to a pair of sisters every few years, at least, until Chante and Elise stop the Vicious Cycle.
-   _Crash Bandicoot_: The Komodo Brothers, although they only appeared together in _Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back_ and _Crash Bash_, while Joe went it alone in _Crash Team Racing_. Neither has been seen since.
-   _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_ with Junko Enoshima and Mukuro Ikusaba, the Despair sisters. Or at least that's how it was supposed to go, if Junko hadn't executed Mukuro for fun. For what it's worth, they were still probably this leading up to the killing game, when they engineered The Tragedy.
-   _Dark Souls III_: Lorian the Elder Prince and Lothric the Younger Prince. Lorian is crippled and mute thanks to the curse borne by Lothric, but he's willing to protect his ill younger brother regardless. Should you defeat Lorian, Lothric will revive him and they will both fight against you.
-   _Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening_: Dante and Vergil for one glorious moment put aside their differences and subject Big Bad Arkham to the wrong side of a Curb-Stomp Battle. It's implied Dante and Vergil have even done this before as they skillfully switch swords with each other mid-fight. Played straight again in _Devil May Cry 5_ as The Stinger shows Dante and Vergil demolishing some demons together in the underworld, albeit in a Enemy Mine situation.
-   _Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten_: Fuka and Desco, though the former isn't initially happy with the idea of a demon she just met calling her a sister. She does warm up to her and the idea over time, though, and they end up forming a proper team in short time.
-   _Double Dragon_: Billy and Jimmy Lee, the Double Dragons.
    -   In the arcade version of _Double Dragon 3_, this trope is invoked literally by having the playable characters divided into four groups of different sibling teams (the Lee Bros., the Oyama Bros., the Urquidez Bros., and the Chin Bros.), essentially an excuse to allow more than one player to control the same character.
    -   Billy and Jimmy's counterpart in _River City Ransom_ were named Randy and Andy. Their counterparts in the _Kunio-kun_ series were named Ryūichi and Ryūji Hattori.
-   _Dragon Age II_: Hawke and his or her twin siblings are quite capable in battle, and the surviving twin will always have a class that compliments Hawke's, also making them Sword and Sorcerer.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Palom and Porom are two little twins who team up with Cecil in _Final Fantasy IV_.
    -   The same game introduced the Magus Sisters, a trio of sisters who serve as Barbariccia's minions. They made a few reapearrances in some form in several other games since, most notably as a bonus summon in _Final Fantasy X_.
    -   From _Final Fantasy X_, we have the Summoner Issaru, along with his two younger brothers as his Guardians.
    -   Sisters Faris and Lenna from _Final Fantasy V_.
    -   Edgar and Sabin Figaro from _Final Fantasy VI_. Royal siblings, no less. Having them in the same team together is only mandatory for one very brief period, but their most significant scenes involve both of them. Amusingly, while Sabin can be recruited before Edgar in the World of Ruin, but because he's optional, the (mandatory) scenes for Edgar's recruitment leave him mostly silent. You'd think he'd have some comments about his brother's Paper-Thin Disguise, but no.
    -   _Final Fantasy Dimensions_ has two sets of siblings, Diana + Aigis and Alba + Dusk. For most of the game the siblings are separated by the dimensional rift, but they can all potentially be on the same team in the endgame.
-   _Fire Emblem_: This is very common in the series:
    -   _Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon & the Blade of Light_, _Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem_, and their remakes have a few. Both games have the Whitewing sisters Palla, Catria, and Est and the axe fighter brothers Barst, Bord, and Cord, _Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light_ has Lena/Matthis and Minerva/Maria, and _New Mystery_ has Minerva/Michalis. Marth/Elice in both games, Lena/Matthis and Minerva/Maria in _Mystery of the Emblem_, and Maria/Michalis in _New Mystery_ are downplayed examples since the sisters of each pairing are among the last characters to join the party.
    -   _Fire Emblem Gaiden_ has the above-mentioned Palla, Catria, and Est return, while the remake _Echoes: Shadows of Valentia_ has Celica fight alongside her long-lost and presumed-dead older brother Conrad.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War_ has Sigurd fight alongside Ethlyn in the first generation, and almost every playable character in the second generation has a playable sibling.
    -   _Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade_ has the pegasus siblings Shanna, Thea, and Juno, the armor knight siblings Bors and Gwendolyn, and the Etrurian nobles Klein and Clarine.
    -   _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_ has the pegasus-riding siblings Florina, Fiora, and Farina, plus the siblings Priscilla and Raven.
    -   _Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones_ stars the royal siblings of Renais, Eirika and Ephraim (who double subvert this in that they don't spend much time fighting alongside each other until halfway through the game). In addition, the royalty of Frelia, Innes and Tana, fight together, as well as Tethys and her brother Ewan. The cavaliers Franz and Forde are also brothers.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance_ and _Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn_ both have Ike/Mist, Oscar/Boyd/Rolf, Marcia/Makalov, and Lucia/Geoffrey, while _Radiant Dawn_ has Lethe/Lyre and Micaiah/Sanaki (who don't learn about their relationship until the end of the game). Reyson/Rafiel/Leanne is an aversion in that they can never take the battlefield at the same time.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Awakening_:
        -   Ylissean royalty Chrom can be this with his younger sister Lissa, taking advantage of the same Pair Up mechanic that originated in this game and passed on to _Fates._
        -   Any of the second generation children can form a Paired Up team with their sister Lucina or their sister Morgan, if their father is Chrom or a male Avatar, respectively.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
        -   Through SpotPass, Say'ri can team up with one of the Secret Characters, an alternate version of her brother Yen'fay.
    -   _Fire Emblem Fates_:
        -   The Polar Opposite Twin ninja Saizo and Kaze can act as this on the _Birthright_ and _Revelation_ paths with the Pair-Up mechanic, which lets units of the army support and defend one another in battle. But on the _Conquest_ path, they have more of a one-sided (on Saizo's part) Cain and Abel, with Saizo enraged over Kaze's defection to their homeland Hoshido's Arch-Enemy Nohr.
        -   The members of the Hoshidan royal family (Ryoma, Hinoka, Takumi and Sakura) and the Avatar can act as this with each other on the _Birthright_ and _Revelation_ paths using the Pair Up mechanic, though it's subverted in the Avatar's case, as he or she is Not Blood Siblings with the Hoshidan royals. Likewise, the Nohrian royal family (Xander, Camilla, Leo, and Elise) can team up (although it's downplayed here; they are paternal half-siblings, and the Avatar is adopted).
        -   As in _Awakening_, any of the second-generation children can Pair Up with their brother Kana or their brother Shigure, as long as their mother is a female Avatar or Azura, respectively.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
        -   Twin maids Flora and Felicia of _Fates_ can Pair Up on the _Conquest_ and _Revelation_ routes.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_, as of Version 1.1.0, Mercedes and Jeritza (also known as the Death Knight) can become one on the Crimson Flower route, as nobles of house Bartels.
    -   _Fire Emblem Heroes_ has the twin protagonists Alfonse and Sharena, the royal siblings of Askr. The four royal siblings from the Kingdom of Nifl (Fjorm, Gunnthrá, Hrid, and Ylgr) also count.
    -   _Fire Emblem Warriors_ has the twin protagonists Rowan and Lianna, the royal siblings of Aytolis.
-   _The Great Giana Sisters_ features twin sisters, however Giana's twin is missing in one game and is the Damsel in Distress in another. The franchise started out as a Distaff Counterpart PC version of _Super Mario Bros._.
-   _Len'en_: The Shitodo siblings (Aoji, Hooaka, and Kuroji) appear in the first game as stage bosses and, by the fourth game, become a playable team.
