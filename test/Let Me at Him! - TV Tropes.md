_**WHO THE HELL DOES HE THINK HE IS?! I'LL MURDER THE BUM!!**_

**Mrs. Beakley:** Oh dear, no sign of them yet. Should I call the police?  
**Scrooge:** Aye, to hold me back when those rascals finally get home!

A Crime Time Soap and Detective Drama trope.

A detective (rarely a great one, though), angered by a possible or actual perp being smug and possibly threatening someone else, lunges for them and has to be restrained by fellow officers. This is not usually part of a Good Cop/Bad Cop ploy, instead being sheer anger or hatred on the part of the detective (often when It's Personal). Particularly vulnerable to stuff like If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him! when there is actual murderous intent (this is quite rare in police shows, though).

This trope is very easily Played for Laughs both within and outside the police procedural. Nastier examples, however, may very well overlap with Trouble Entendre or Reminiscing About Your Victims.

When the dealer starts taunting the inspector, he starts to look as though he's going to punch the smartass... only to turn around and deck the other cop in the face. As both stare dumbfounded, he delivers this awesome line: "You disappoint me, Gunther. A two-bit drug dealer lays a hand on you and you just sit there?"

He convinces another detective to conduct the interview instead while he regains his composure.
-   When Honor Harrington learns, in _The Honor of the Queen_, that a P.O.W. prison guard has been ordering prisoners raped and beaten, she goes after him with murderous intent.

Rather than an If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him! speech, though, she's told that there's no need to commit career suicide by killing him without a trial, when there's plenty of evidence to convict him and hang him after a full court-martial.
-   Inverted, subverted, and played straight to different degrees in J.D. Robb's _In Death_ series. Most of the time Eve, the Bad Cop in almost every interview, intentionally provokes this reaction, sometimes even letting them land a blow to justify Epic Battle Boredom. At the same time, some of the series' villains and their Sympathetic Murderers will elicit this reaction from Hot-Blooded cops if it's personal. Sometimes it looks like one party or the other will snap and lunge... only to cool down and call a lawyer or point out a flaw in the suspect's story.

-   A sketch in _Key & Peele_ is an extended look at a guy failing to invoke this.

-   A rare comedic example is _Married... with Children_, where Marcy is frequently having to be pulled off Al, usually as a result of him making fun of her figure or her feminist beliefs.
-   _The Phil Silvers Show_: A variation of this trope, where Bilko ordered his men to hold him back in a serious and threatening tone, then proceeded to struggle against them trying to get at the guy who pissed him off. As he starts to break free, he urges them with greater and greater urgency to hold him back better (so he doesn't have to actually fight).

     Real Life 

-   In an inversion of expectations, a crowd of helpful bystanders responding to Richard Lawrence's assassination attempt on President Andrew Jackson had to hurry... to restrain _Jackson_. This was because Jackson, infamous for both his terrible temper and frightful bloody-mindedness, was bludgeoning _the assassin_ with his walking stick after the latter's pistols failed him. The responders, including no less a figure than Davy Crockett, had to stop the President from further mangling Lawrence, whose subsequent arrest was probably a mercy by comparison. To this day, Jackson is the only president to stop his own assassination attempt, and the only president that had to be stopped from _killing his own would-be assassin_.
