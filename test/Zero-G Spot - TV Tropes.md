"_We choose to bone on the Moon, not because we are easy, but because we are hard._"

Space. The final frontier. And a completely new environment for indulging in humanity's favorite pastime: sex!

Many writers have turned their imagination to the subject of what sex would be like in zero gravity. The general consensus seems to be that it would be like a Two-Person Pool Party without the water (examples involving _more_ than two people are hard to come by, as no one enjoys dealing with the three-body problem).

Unfortunately, a bit of Artistic Licence is at play here. In zero gravity, the blood in your body pools higher up, and your heart shrinks as it gets used to doing less work, both of which are obviously bad for trying to maintain arousal. Zero gravity heavily reduces both the friction and resistance in the environment, subsequently removing most of the actual physical feedback people expect and are familiar with from sexual activity on Earth. The microgravity environment would also mean that the couple would be a slave to Newtonian physics, meaning that any movement is going to cause both partners to drift, then careen wildly around their spaceship, resulting in multiple possible injuries. All of these issues still apply to lesser extents in low gravity environments such as the surface of Mars or the Moon, so until we figure out Artificial Gravity this trope will likely remain a fantastical one.

As of early 2016, this is not known to have been attempted in any actual spacecraft, despite the attempt of a porn studio in 2010 to hire Spaceship One for the purpose. Virgin Galactic declined the offer, nominally on the grounds that accepting would make their company name exceedingly silly (though it was more likely to avoid having their company be associated with pornography). In June 2015, a porn website launched a $3.4 million Indiegogo campaign to fund a video of sex in space; exact plans were unclear, although they did claim to be "in talks" with launch companies before the funding campaign failed. There was one married couple that did fly together on STS-47: N. Jan Davis and Mark C. Lee, who had met and then married secretly during training, and told NASA so soon before the flight that there wasn't time to send a replacement. However, if they attempted this trope—which is itself highly doubtful—they aren't talking about it, and neither is anyone else. The closest anyone's actually come was a twenty second shot for a porn film that was done by the same means of simulating microgravity as the infamous "Vomit Comet" plane ride: fly to 11,000 feet and engage in a brief, steep dive. (No word on what this actually cost the production company.)

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans_: Mikazuki and Atra make love inside the cockpit of Gundam Barbatos. At the time, they were on a ship in deep space, in a hangar where the ship's Artificial Gravity was either very low or off entirely.
-   In _UQ Holder!_, Touta and Karin have sex in the vacuum of space (they're immortal, so it won't hurt them) after the former recovers the latter from a very, very lengthy trip through the vast emptiness of space.

    Comic Books 

-   Referenced in _Astro City: Astra Special_ #2. The planet Reklak-4 is part of a nexus of multiple realities that is used as a galactic cultural hub and entertainment center. Some people like to use the recreational low-gravity zones for carnal experiments. Astra Furst's boyfriend tries to persuade her to indulge, leading to this exchange:
    
    **Matt:** But hey— If they can do localized anti-gravity... I don't know, maybe these guys don't care, living in a cosmic place like this. But I'm from Earth, I'm a guy. Seems to me no-gravity would be pretty interesting for, y'know...  
    **Astra:** Sex? They live on planets here, Matt. They do have gravity. Trust me, you're not the first to think of it. They actually have rooms for that, up near the top, where the effect is the strongest. But it's messy, it's awkward, you smack into the walls a lot, and then you have to clean up and it's kinda gross... Or, uh, that's what friends have told me, anyway.
    
-   _Black Moon Chronicles_: A variation where Wismerhill is carried by his Winged Humanoid lover Hellaynnea the succubus to have sex in the clouds.
-   Buffy and Angel do the "flying without a plane" version when Buffy develops (more) superpowers during the "Twilight" arc of the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ 'Season 8' comics.
-   In _Lori Lovecraft: Repression_, Lori and Arthur Black Crow have sex while magically levitating. When Lori attempts to take control of the spell from Arthur, she loses control and the pair of them crash back on to the bed from the ceiling.
-   Several pin-ups in the collection _MILFs From Mars_ from Eros Comix feature the eponymous MILFs engaging in hot girl-on-girl action in zero g.
-   Starfire and Captain Comet indulge in _REBELS_ #18.
-   Happens to Superman and Lois Lane often.<small>◊</small>
-   _Y: The Last Man_ mentions this in an early issue of the series. Later, it becomes a major plot point.

    Fan Works 

-   Happens in Ethereum Gladiator, given there's no gravity outside the Nethercity's ecodomes.
-   _Hellsister Trilogy_: Satan Girl is a Kryptonian clone and Mordru a powerful sorcerer, so a lack of atmosphere is no trouble whatsoever. Hence Satan Girl takes Mordru out of the planet in the fifth chapter and demands to be taken right there and then.
-   _Last Child of Krypton_: In this crossover Shinji is _Superman_ and Asuka _Supergirl_ (in the rewrite). In the epilogue they make love floating between Earth and the Moon. Given their bodies were modified with Kryptonian DNA with all it implies (flight, invulnerability, capability to hold your breath virtually indefinitely...) they had no trouble pulling it off.
-   A _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_ fic by Talya Firedancer has Heero and Duo having sex in a spaceship. Lampshaded rather snarkily by Duo when he sings a parody of _Fly me to the moon_ after the deed is done.
-   A decidedly not worksafe, but surprisingly well-written Deep Space Nine fanfic, "Nothing Like The Sun". Notable for being one of the few DS9 fics to center around the marriage of Miles and Keiko O'Brien.
-   In _A Prize for Three Empires_, Carol Danvers and Gladiator have sex in a Shi'ar starship.
-   In _Total Command_, Izuku and Ochako tale advantage of the latter's Zero Gravity Quirk to have this in his dorm room.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Cube 2: Hypercube_, two characters, feeling that their deaths are inevitable, have sex in the center of one of the cube rooms that has zero gravity (and possibly accelerated time) until they apparently die of dehydration and eventually desiccate. One of the other characters, moving through cubes with different time flows, comes across their mummified corpses still entwined and spinning in the middle of the room.
-   A variation in _Dracula 2000_ which used vampiric levitation. Lucy winds up turned when she is seduced by Dracula and they have sex which winds up going off the bed to the ceiling, due to Dracula's flying powers. She's so mesmerized that she doesn't notice Drac spouting fangs until he bites her.

-   A variation in _Harlock: Space Pirate_ which has Kei Yuki taking a zero-G shower.
-   James Bond and Holly Goodhead attempt reentry in _Moonraker_, making Bond both a member of the Mile-High Club and the 100 Mile High Club.
    
    **Goodhead:** James, take me around the world one more time!
    
    -   Also in the novelization, Bond and Goodhead witness a couple on Drax's space station doing this.
-   The comedy _Moving Violations_ suggests the main characters, played by actors John Murray and Jennifer Tilly, have an intimate encounter in a weightlessness simulator.
-   _RoboCop_ (2014): The news ticker on _The Novak Element_ at one point mentions that the President has approved astronauts bringing hookers into space.
-   Word of God states that original scripts for _Sunshine_ had a planned sex scene between Cassie and Capa.
-   The sci-fi horror film _Supernova_ (2000) featured sex between several of the characters in zero-gravity areas of the Medical Ship.
-   In _Thank You for Smoking_, there are plans to incorporate this trope into a movie. Along with cigarettes, of course.
-   Another vampire version in _Underworld: Rise of the Lycans_, where a vampire and a lycan have gravity-defying sex while hanging off the edge of a cliff.
-   Private Media Group filmed a brief scene for the space-themed pornographic film _The Uranus Experiment_ in a Russian aircraft flying a parabolic track (similar to NASA's Vomit Comet). _The Uranus Experiment_ features around 20 seconds of actors Sylvia Saint and Nick Lang (who portray astronauts living on a space station) having sex in freefall. The scene was controversially nominated for a Nebula Award (as a protest against the Nebula Awards' Best Screenplay category), but did not win.
-   Happens between Adam and Eden in _Upside Down_.

    Literature 

-   In the Alan Dean Foster novelization of _Alien_, Parker tells Brett about an inexperienced visitor to a zero-G brothel who started spinning during the "act", and then started throwing up...also in zero-G.
-   _Arrivals from the Dark_: In _The Faraway Saikat_, Ivar's bed aboard the Saikat station is little more than an anti-gravity platform he floats above when sleeping. Not sure how comfortable that would be. Also not sure how the bed keeps him from drifting out of the field and crashing to the floor. Ivar also uses it to sleep with a Kni'lina female.
-   In _Literature/Artemis_, Jazz notes that the Moon is a popular destination for elderly couples looking to add novelty to their sex lives.
-   Science fiction and popular science writer Isaac Asimov made conjectures in writing about what sex would be like in the weightless environment of space, in 1973 in _Sex in a Spaceship_. He anticipated some of the benefits of engaging in sex in an environment of microgravity. He also mentions 1/6-gee sex in the final chapter of _The Gods Themselves_, which takes place on the moon.
    -   In his short story _I'm in Marsport Without Hilda_, Flora keeps her apartment at 0.4 of Earth's gravity because it makes hugging better. As Max puts it:
        
        \[I\]f you've ever held a girl in your arms at 0.4 gees, you need no explanation. If you haven't, explanations will do no good. I'm also sorry for you.
        
-   The _BattleTech_ novel _The Price of Glory_ ends with the afterglow of such a scene, with the couple in question "turning gently".
-   Attempted and failed in _Constellation Games_ by Leonard Richardson.
    
    "Man! Those suggestive docking sequences in sci-fi movies make it look so easy. Don't they teach you how to do this in astronaut training?"  
    "No, they just tell you not to do it."  
    "That's what they told us, in high school, but nobody listened."
    
-   _Dread Empire's Fall_ has "recreation tubes" for the inhabitants of their starships. They work for _up to two_ occupants and presumably have versions for all of the species that could be crewing their ships.
-   In the sci-fi book _Fallen Angels_, one of the spacemen (who have lived most of their lives in orbit, and so have severe issues with living in gravity again) wonders how people make love in G. His observation? "They probably don't need Velcro."
-   _Galactic Marines_: In _Semper Mars_, Dr. David Alexander does this with his French observer during the long voyage between Earth and Mars. Finding room to do this in the cramped cycler is difficult but not impossible. They end up using harnesses to keep themselves from drifting away from each other during vigorous thrusts. There's also plenty of cleanup afterwards, trying to chase down all the fluid droplets before they get into some critical system. Apparently, there is also a space version of the Mile-High Club called the Three Dolphin Club. In _Luna Marine_, Alexander explains to his new lover that, when dolphins have sex, there is a frequently a third dolphin helping "push", hence the name.
-   The _Gaea Trilogy_ novel _Titan_ provides this line: "Cirocco liked space, reading and sex, not necessarily in that order. She had never been able to satisfactorily combine all three, but two was not bad." In the second scene, she is not reading...
-   _Hive Mind (2016)_: Characters sleep in floating 'sleep fields', akin to Known Space. Amber and Lucas share one once they become a couple.
-   In Arthur C. Clarke's _Imperial Earth_, travelers from Saturn to Earth have a few hours of zero-gee halfway along, while the ship is flipping over to decelerate.
    -   Before that, there was a cruise that had some... kinks... that took some time to recover from. Among them:
        
        ... and everyone had learned a great deal, though not necessarily in the areas that the organizers intended. The first few weeks, for example, were mostly occupied by experiments in zero-gravity sex, despite warnings that this was an expensive addiction for those compelled to spend most of their lives on planetary surfaces.
        
-   In one of the _John Grimes_ novels by A. Bertram Chandler, a female purser tells Grimes that she got her job after the last purser broke her leg because she failed to obey the Golden Rule of space travel—_Stop what you are doing and secure any loose objects when the acceleration warning sounds_—though the ship's doctor avoided injury by landing on top of her. Grimes is about to ask what the purser and the doctor were up to that they couldn't stop doing, then quickly shuts up.
-   In Ben Bova's novel _Kinsman_, the astronaut characters consider founding the Zero Gee Club; like the Mile High Club, but higher.
    
    _"Think of the possibilities."  
    "Hmm. Three-dimensional."_
    
-   _Known Space_:
    -   Zero-g sex is far from uncommon, due to zero-g "sleep fields" which work anywhere. At least one character thinks the sleep field is the greatest invention since sliced bread... But prefers to sleep on a traditional mattress.
    -   In a nod to the problems involved, one character in _Ringworld_ specifically turns the sleepfield _off_ because "we need gravity for this".
    -   Larry Niven discusses the difficulties in low-gravity sex in _The Patchwork Girl_.
-   In _Manifold: Time_, it's mentioned that one spaceflight saw frequent zero-g orgies because the astronauts had no better way to pass their time.
-   Something similar involving buoyancy instead of gravity occurs in Alida Van Gore's _Mermaid's Song_: mermaid sex requires either a heavily padded cave or lots of searoom given the unavoidable propulsive effects of the undulations involved.
-   Mentioned in _Naked Lunch_.
-   Newt Gingrich's books talk about the possibilities of having your wedding night in space. Al Franken, in _Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot_, made fun of this, pointing out that it would probably be quite awkward in reality.
-   In _The Night's Dawn Trilogy_, the Lady Macbeth has a fold-out zero-g sex cage. It's probably not a unique piece of equipment.
-   Mention is made of this happening in Travis S. Taylor's _On to the Asteroid_... in a room on the spaceship that live-streamed video to Earth 24/7. The people talking about it mentioned that the audience for the unintended space porno would have enjoyed it more if the space tourists who pioneered zero-g sex had been sexy young actors rather than middle-aged out of shape businesspeople.
-   In _Presumed Dead_ by Rick Kennett, a female soldier stranded on an alien planet is watching some boring holographic lectures on her computer to kill time. She activates one titled _Space Fittings_ only to find it's zero-G porn.
-   In contrast to _QI_, the novel _Red Lightning_ by John Varley has a scene discussing the _advantages_ of sex in zero gravity: "So the basic or 'missionary' position in free fall is for the girl to wrap her legs around the guy and lock her feet together, and for the guy to hold his legs out straight and try not to let his curling and uncurling toes shove the two of you all over the place." But Ray and Evangeline use "positions emphatically not for the beginner."
-   The _Red Mars Trilogy_ mentions that this happens frequently on the initial voyage to Mars. One of the Russian characters also apparent experimented with many forms of zero-G sex while on _Novy Mir_.
-   _Rendezvous with Rama_: An Eating the Eye Candy version when Commander Norton mulls the effects of zero-gravity on female anatomy.
    
    Some women, Commander Norton had decided long ago, should not be allowed aboard ship; weightlessness did things to their breasts that were too damn distracting. It was bad enough when they were motionless; but when they started to move, and sympathetic vibrations set in, it was more than any warm-blooded male should be asked to take.
    
-   Eric Idle in _The Road to Mars_ describes it as "like having sex _inside_ a water bed."
-   _So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish_ describes Arthur and Fenchurch having Their First Time while flying. It's not technically zero-g but the Hitchiker universe's method of flight makes it effectively the same thing.
-   In _The Sparrow_, Anne and George have one suggestion: duck tape.
-   Spider Robinson goes into heaps of detail in his _Stardancer_ trilogy, including pointing out that a couple making love _unrestrained_ in zero gravity will inevitably end up bumping gently against the air vent — and any foolish enough to try to avert this by turning off the ventilation will suffocate in their own exhalations.
-   Inevitable on Gemworld in the _Star Trek: Gemworld_ duology.
-   Characters do have sex in space aboard spacecraft and both deep space and orbital facilities in the _Star Wars Expanded Universe_ and _Star Wars Legends_. Normally this would be done under artificial gravity, however artificial gravity in the Star Wars universe is variable both directionally (outer decks on both Death Stars have gravity following the curve of its hull like on a planet or moon with inner decks all being oriented one way, Super Star Destroyer _Lusankya_'s prison wings are upside down relative to the rest of the ship, and _Millennium Falcon's_ gunwells have gravity at angles to the rest of the ship) and in field strength. This makes gravity manipulation to spice up one's sexual encounters a very real possibility. Not to mention that Force users can levitate both themselves and others...
-   _Vorkosigan Saga_:
    -   Inverted in _Falling Free_ when a girl specifically engineered for free fall (with a second pair of arms instead of legs) wonders how 'downsiders' can have sex without bouncing apart, since they have no lower hands to grip their lovers with. Her downsider lover explains that gravity has its uses. She also points out that condoms sure beat chasing bodily fluids around the compartment with a hand-vac.
    -   At another point in the series, Miles acquires a zero-g "bed," and decides to give it a whirl, musing on the rumors of the fantastic nature of sex in zero-g. He crawls out a few minutes later after deciding that the bed smells like "at least three" people had recently been investigating those same rumors.
-   In one _The Witcher_ novel, Geralt reminisces some Yennefer's "experiments", including use of a levitation spell on them both.
-   _Worldwar_: This is justified in the _Colonization_ books, since the _Lewis and Clark_ is on a lifelong mission in the Asteroid Belt, and her crew is never coming home. Condoms are a must, though, since no one wants to experiment with trying to bear a child in zero-g. It helps that their jumpsuits are designed to "zip together". Even then, there is plenty of cleanup afterwards. When the guy is incredulous at the latter fact, the girl points out that there's _always_ cleanup after sex even in gravity, it's just that guys normally don't bother. In the final _Homeward Bound_ book, by the 2030s, humans have habitats in orbit of Earth and the Moon. Presumably, this trope is a regular occurrence there.
-   _Zones of Thought_: The problem of obtaining leverage during zero-g sex is mentioned in _A Deepness in the Sky_. Also, one of the protagonists in _A Fire Upon the Deep_ thinks that zero-g sex isn't what it's cracked up to be (again largely due to the difficulties of obtaining leverage safely).

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Boys (2019)_: In "We Gotta Go Now" Homelander and Stormfront are last seen while having sex in mid-air via his flying ability.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   "Once More With Feeling". At the end of Tara's love song "Under Your Spell" she levitates into the air over her bed, and it's strongly implied she's doing it so an off-camera Willow can perform cunnilingus on her.
    -   Buffy and Angel during the "Twilight" arc in the Season 8 comics.
        -   This is, of course, in the issue "Them F#©%ing (Plus the True History of the Universe)".
-   _Carnival Row_: Jonah engages in something similar with Tormaline, who's a Faerie-as the two have sex, she bats her wings to lift both of them off the bed. This experience seems to be a part of the appeal that Faerie prostitutes have, since they also fly down to be viewed by potential clients.
-   This topic was the focus of the final story on the night of June 29, 2010's _Countdown With Keith Olbermann_. He struggled (without success) to keep a straight face. They showed clips of a History Channel documentary about the subject in which two speculative experts postulated that "One thing everyone does agree upon is that one or more of the mating partners needs to be restrained."
-   _Cowboy Bebop (2021)_. After experiencing her first orgasm, Faye Valentine is eagerly doing research on the subject of sex (though Spike Spiegel points out that the mens' magazine she's reading is not exactly an authoritative source). He leaves her reading up on the art of "pontooning in zero-gravity".
-   Not quite genuine Zero-G, but a couple on _CSI: NY_ got busted for public indecency because they were having sex while bungie-jumping. It's strongly implied that this is the female jumper's personal favorite kink.
-   _Defying Gravity_: Done with the Cranes in the pilot.
-   Also in the pilot of _The Expanse_, Jim Holden is introduced having zero-G sex with the ship's navigator. However gravity returns when the ship starts its engines and they're both thrown to the floor.
-   In _The Magicians (2016)_ Kady and Penny have sex in mid air, though it's done by levitation here.
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_:
    -   "In Throes of Increasing Wonder...": Lestat de Lioncourt and Louis de Pointe du Lac have sex while the pair are floating vertically just above the ground.
    -   "Like Angels Put in Hell by God": There's a brief moment where Lestat and Louis levitate horizontally over their bed during lovemaking.
-   Dave's sexual fantasy on _NewsRadio_ is making love on the Space Shuttle...with a space prostitute.
-   Newlyweds on a space-tourism shuttle have sex in a storage cubicle on _The Outer Limits (1995)_'s "Joy Ride".
-   This subject came up on _QI_. Stephen Fry pointed out three drawbacks to this: your you-know-what will be smaller, you have problems maintaining contact and there's the danger of fluids drifting around the cabin and getting into equipment. Not that this deterred Bill Bailey and Alan Davies from vividly describing the possibilities of space porn in front of an embarrassed Stephen Fry.

-   _Red Dwarf_ references it while making fun of regulation numbers: "No officer with false teeth should attempt oral sex in zero gravity". And again: "Hey, Pop-up Kama Sutra! Zero-gravity version, that's mine!".
-   The _Red Shoe Diaries_ episode "Weightless". A beautiful astronaut, trapped in a dying spacecraft a million miles from home, makes tender love for the last time with her co-pilot as she ruminates about the sensual path of her life that led her to the adventure of outer space.
-   The idea was floated (if you'll pardon the pun) in _Salvage_, the pilot for the TV series _Salvage 1_. However, being a PG sort of show, nothing comes of it.
-   In the _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode "Melora," the titular character is an alien from a planet with very low gravity, and it is strongly implied that she and Dr. Bashir get it on in her quarters with the gravity turned off.
-   _Taken_: In "Charlie and Lisa", the title characters Charlie Keys and Lisa Clarke have sex in zero gravity aboard one of the alien ships.
-   Sloane on _The Umbrella Academy (2019)_ can manipulate gravity, and uses this to have sex with Luther.
-   This came up on a particularly good game of _Press Conference_ on the British version of _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_, in which Tony Slattery had to guess who he was - the first man to make love in space - by the questions Stephen Frost, Colin Mochrie and Ryan Stiles asked him. In case you even needed to be told, there were double entendres galore.
-   Magician Lance Burton 's levitation in _Lance Burton: The Legend Begins_ featuring him and his female assistant under the blanket. An alternate version can be seen here, starting from 10:38.

    Music 

-   There are a few Filk Song treatments of the subject, perhaps the best-known example being "A Reconsideration Of Anatomical Docking Maneuvers In A Zero-Gravity Environment" by Diana G. Gallagher. She makes a good point and gives another good reason (in addition to the existing ones) for restraints.
-   Arjen Anthony Lucassen's song "The Space Hotel" from the _Lost in the New Real_ album mentions making love in zero G.
-   Mastodon performs a song about Intercourse with You in space. The title? _Stargasm._

    Print Media 

-   The _National Lampoon_ had a pictorial zero-gravity sex guide, the NASA Sutra.

    Roleplay 

-   In _We Are Our Avatars_, Used as a way to convince Black Baron into giving up his piece of the device.
    
    **Imca:** ....Ummmmmm, why don't you retire in space. You can make a movie out of it. "Pimps in Space".... "Bitches in Space".... Whatever you want to call it. Not that I would approve of those but negotiation....  
    _\[Black Baron thinks about it for a moment\]_  
    **Black Baron:** Well, the ladies do like the ol' space horizontal tango...  
    ...Ah, what the fuck. Ya'll mothafuckas got yerself a deal!
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   _GURPS: Biotech_ mentions, for no apparent reason, that the modifications that would make someone especially useful as an engineer on a starship also open up all kinds of kinky possibilities.

    Urban Legends 

-   A spoof document claims that NASA had conducted experiments on the feasibility of sexual activity in zero-gravity environment.

    Video Games 

-   There was a (PG rated) zero-G romance scene in _Final Fantasy VIII_.
-   In _Mass Effect: Andromeda_ you can choose to have a one-night-stand with Peebee in the _Tempest's_ escape pod with the artificial gravity turned off.
-   In _The Sims 4_, sims can woohoo with other sims in a rocket they have built, ascending into space on a cloud of hearts.
-   In _Tales of Symphonia_, when the heroes go into outer space because the Tower of Salvation goes extremely high up, an optional cutscene has (who else?) Zelos going on about this, and (who else?) Lloyd completely missing the point (Zelos didn't actually mention sex, which is probably why Lloyd didn't get it; Also because he's an idiot).

    Web Comics

    Western Animation 

-   _Archer_: Sterling Archer and Pam, whom he had stowed away specifically for the purpose in "Space Race Part 1". Prior to this, Archer accuses the Big Bad of trying to get his mother into the Million Mile-High Club after seeing them flirt with each other.
-   Discussed in _Big Mouth_ when Jay and Missy collaborate on a crossover Slash Fic set in space, and Jay insists they include a zero-gravity sixty-nine scene.
-   Peter Griffin of _Family Guy_ once masturbated in space. He later said that the inside of the shuttle began to look like a snowglobe after a while.
-   _Futurama_ has a magazine called "Zero-G Juggs" that Scruffy is often seen reading that plays with the idea of this trope, even if only the name is shown. Use your imagination.
-   In _Inside Job (2021)_ this is why JFK lead space exploration efforts. Since he had already experienced all forms of Earth-based sex, he wanted to see what sex in space was like, culminating in the moon landing. However, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong, alongside the other astronauts landing on the moon, ran off to start a free-love sex cult, requiring the moon landing to be faked to save face.
    
    **JFK**: We choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because I am hard.
