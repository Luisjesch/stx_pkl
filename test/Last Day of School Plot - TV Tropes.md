_What time is it? Summertime!  
It's our vacation!  
What time is it? Party time!  
That's right, say it loud!  
What time is it? The time of our lives!  
Anticipation!  
What time is it? Summertime!  
School's out, scream and shout!_

Yes! Finally! It's the day everyone's been waiting for all school year long before a big summer vacation of fun! It's...THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL!

Many things happen on the last day of school, such as last-minute preparations, cramming, anticipation, and trying to admit one's feelings to someone special. Episodes don't always involve the last day. The plot may take place on the last few days, and it can expand beyond the last day in some cases.

Characters may also learn An Aesop based on whatever they experience.

The opposite of the First Day of School Episode. Sometimes involves a High-School Dance as prom is often set on the last day of school for efficiency's sake. Can overlap with Graduate from the Story or Senior Year Struggles if the plot of a work features the last day of school and builds to the graduation ceremony, though many schools hold graduation a few days before the last day of school. See also Summer School Sucks, if the student's grades are failing or incomplete, and can't enjoy their last day of the academic year.
