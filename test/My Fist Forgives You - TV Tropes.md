**Ezra:** It's not my fault...  
**Zeb:** Tell that to my fist!

This is a subtrope of Restrained Revenge in which a character claims a right to attack the one who wronged them once before forgiving them. Sometimes accompanied by the phrase, "Now we're even." Oftentimes the motivation behind the punch stems from Anger Born of Worry.

If done at the receiving party's urging, may involve Hit Me, Dammit!. Occasionally overlaps with Get A Hold Of Yourself Man or Dope Slap. Compare Easily Forgiven. Contrast Sorry I Fell on Your Fist and One Free Hit.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Blood Lad_, at least the manga adaptation, Staz does this to his older brother, Braz, in return for a Hilariously Abusive Childhood and being near constantly antagonized over the course of the series.
-   Subverted in an episode of _Digimon Adventure_, where Taichi offers a chance for Koushiro to hit him to atone for having taken out his anger on him, but Koushiro passes it up, understanding that Taichi was just venting and didn't mean to antagonise him. Their Digimon seemed willing to take Taichi up on it, however.
-   In _Durarara!!_, Celty does this to Shinra after she discovers that he knew Yagiri Pharmaceuticals had her head in the past. He claims it's the same as a wedding ceremony.
-   After Polnareff apologizes to Kakyoin for being a hasty, angry prick and apparently getting Avdol killed in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders_, Kakyoin's response is to smash an elbow into Polnareff's face, compounding Polnareff's already bloody injuries.
    
    **Kakyoin:** That's all I'm giving you as proof that we've made up, _Polnareff_.
    
    **Polnareff:** Right... M-Merci, Kakyoin. Ugh...
    
-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_: After Ishigami makes some comments about Kaguya and Fujiwara's breasts without realizing that they're in the room, Fujiwara makes her presence known, assembles a paper fan out of a newspaper, bashes him over and over again in the back of the head with it until she runs out of breath, and then forgives him. Kaguya then implies that she'd do _far_ worse to him if he ever does something like that again.
-   Attempted in _Kill la Kill_ when Satsuki allows Ryuko to punch her for all the crap she went through in the first bits of the series (the whole student subjugation deal and using Ryuko as a pawn in her plans). Ryuko takes her up on it... but every time she tries, the Elite Four keep blocking her hits (and call her out for pulling her punches when they do). Ultimately Ryuko gives up and just accepts the apology, mostly because she knows Satsuki's friends won't allow harm to come to her and mostly because Ryuko is in no position to judge Satsuki, having just recently been freed from mind control that wouldn't have happened in the first place if she hadn't recklessly run off to confront Ragyo and got herself captured.
-   In _Love Hina_ Naru does this to Keitaro after he peeks at her diary. And when he stumbles on her bathing. And when he's sitting quietly minding his own business. And when there's a weekday with the letter "y" in it...
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz_ has a variation on this. The boys are cornered by the enemy army and Heero, out of the blue, asks Duo to punch him. After some initial hesitation, Duo complies with a right hook...and Heero counters with a gut punch that knocks Duo out. "One for one, now we're even." Heero pretends to be unconscious and gets away when the guards aren't looking, and Duo later escapes their prison (having realized Heero's plan but wishing he'd come up with a better one).
-   In _Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam: Steel Seven_, Europa and Captain Onmo meet up after Onmo had Europa tailed because they weren't sure she wasn't a spy. The meeting is tense but polite at first, with Europa saying she would probably have done the same thing had the situation been reversed... then she slugs Onmo in the stomach and walks on.
-   In the anime version of _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, Toji demands that Shinji hit him after realizing he's unjustly treated Shinji like crap. Shinji complies after some hesitation. In the manga adaptation, Shinji decides it's better to have Toji owe him one, and later embarrasses Toji in front of the girls in their class during PE. There are some rather disturbing parallels between Shinji's beatdown of Toji, and Unit-01's destruction of Unit-03.
-   In _Soul Eater_, Maka punches Black Star in an argument, and after Black Star accepts her apology, she also insists that he punch her back. He doesn't hold back, though she also insisted he not and actually smiles despite lying on her back.
-   _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_: Kurogane threatens to clock clone Syaoran for one of his actions. The original gets a half-hearted knuckle-tap in his clones' stead, though the Distant Finale suggests that there may be a way to bring the Clone back after all, so Kurogane uses the "he still owes me a punch" as an excuse to travel with original!Syaoran.
    -   Fai also does this to Kurogane after he cut off his own arm to save Fai's life. Yes, Fai is the one punching Kurogane for doing that. It Makes Sense in Context (kind of).
-   Played for Laughs in _Yu-Gi-Oh!_. During the Duelist Kingdom arc, Honda makes some comments that offend Jonouchi, and the latter punches him in the face for it. After Jonouchi wins the duel against Dinosaur Ryuzaki, Honda punches him too and calls it even.

    Audio Play 

-   Chapter 13 of _We're Alive_: Burt asks Angel to hit him to make up for trying to abandon the Tower in the previous chapter. After Angel lays Burt out, all is forgiven (though Michael can be heard yelling "Hit him again!" from an overlooking window).

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   In one Batman / Punisher crossover, The Punisher punches Batman. Batman then says, "I let you take that punch, because I'm sure you think I deserved it. I won't let you take another."
    -   Batman actually does this a lot. If he knows he's been a jerkass to his allies, he tends to let them have one punch "free". Other examples include Kevin Smith's Green Arrow run, and again during _Bruce Wayne: Fugitive_.
    -   Shortly after Jason Todd was killed, Batman punched Superman, who was trying to talk him out of pursuing revenge. In a hilarious subversion, _Batman hurt his hand_, and rather than apologize, Superman mentioned that if he hadn't rolled with the punch, Batman could've crippled himself.
    -   Another time Superman offers to do this again. Since Batman is standing on the Batwing and is _really_ pissed off this time, he opts to take his free shot with missiles instead.
    -   During _The Road Home_ one-shot, when Stephanie Brown sees Bruce again after he returns from being thought dead and putting her through another Secret Test of Character she slaps him, then runs off yelling that she's glad he's not dead. He lets her have it.
-   In _Supergirl Vol. 5_, Grace Choi of _Outsiders_ tried this on Supergirl as revenge for freezing during a battle and failing to watch her back, but broke her hand despite her formidable strength.
-   Gold Digger has a hilarious and tear-jerking example. Brittney is fighting the Dynasty, who are very much an expy of The Borg in this area. One of her allies sends her off, promising to get away. Said ally reappears...as a Dynasty warrior. Brittney promises to get her back to normal, and then punches her for lying. After the brainwashing and such is reversed? She follows through, then commences with the tearful reunion.
-   FBI Agent King Faraday tries to arrest The Flash in _DC: The New Frontier_. Later, when they have to work together to save the earth, Flash has no hard feelings. After he punches Faraday in the face, that is.
-   In the _Forgotten Realms_ comics, Ishi beats on Jasmine rather harder than she intended when Jasmine taunts her about her "boyfriend" Agrivar. After recovering her temper, an embarrassed Ishi offers Jasmine one free shot to make them even, and Jasmine promptly kicks her in the head.
    
    **Jasmine**: You're right, copperskin. I'm fine now.
    

    Fan Works 

-   In _Winter War_, Ikkaku does this to Yumichika\- not for his apparent betrayal of Soul Society earlier, but for not telling Ikkaku a rather critical piece of information (which would have allowed Ikkaku to figure out what was going on, among other things) beforehand.
-   In the _Ben 10_ Fanfic _Hero High: Sphinx Academy_, Ben begrudgingly decides to go along with Alex's plan under one condition. That condition being where Ben slugs him in the gut as hard as he can.

Nonetheless, he's grateful that he'll be able to see Reiko again because of them and walks off with a Tearful Smile.
-   _Dauntless (Allora Gale)_: Lelouch "forgives" Lukas' failure to protect his friends when their hotel was attacked by the JLF by punching the other teen in the face. Notably, Lelouch had already forgiven him and was angered more by Lukas' need to be forgiven.
-   In _The Last Prayer_, after it comes out that Choji accidentally drugged Ino, part of his reparations towards her is letting Ino hit him. Right as said condition is stated, Ino punches him hard enough to break Choji's nose and launch him into a wall.
-   A variation in _Torn between two earths_: Barry tells Oliver he's about to reveal something he should have told Oliver about a while ago (the existence of Black Siren), and that Oliver will want to hit him once he does. After he does, Oliver tells him the only reason he isn't punching Barry _right now_ is it would be bad PR for the mayor of Star City to be seen attacking a Central City CSI technician. Later, Barry and Cisco are both seen sporting bruised eyes.
    
    **Barry:** We had it coming.  
    **Cisco:** That’s up for debate.  
    **Oliver:** No, you definitely had it coming. Where is she?

-   In _Around the World in Eighty Days_, Phileas Fogg delivers a beautiful one to Inspector Fix. Due to a case of Mistaken Identity, Fix has chased him around the world, caused him many inconveniences, and finally arrested him as soon as he arrived back in England, potentially delaying him enough to make him lose his wager. When Fix releases him, apologising for his mistake:
    
    He walked to the detective, looked him steadily in the face, and with the only rapid motion he had ever made in his life, or which he ever would make, drew back his arms, and with the precision of a machine knocked Fix down. \[...\] Fix, who found himself on the floor, did not utter a word. He had only received his desserts.
    
    -   To prove that Fix is now forgiven, Fogg gives him a share of the profit from the successful wager.

    "Let's see. {punches Artemis in the nose} Works fine.
    
-   The Continental Op story "Women, Politics & Murder" ends this way, with the Sleazy Politician who's served as The Heavy - but _wasn't_ behind the central murder - offering to pay the Op for his troubles after the actual murderer (a cop whose gun went off completely by accident) surrenders himself. The Op ignores the money and goes for a knuckle sandwich, right as they're about to descend a set of steps.
-   _Cradle Series_: By the tenth book, _Reaper_, Emperor Naru Huan of the Blackflame Empire is _pissed_ at his friend Eithan. Not only did Eithan casually advance past Huan's own power level, but when he was fighting in Huan's name in the most important tournament in the world, Eithan didn't even bother to call back once. Huan's sister kept him updated, and Huan's own sponsors congratulated him on Eithan's progress (though they didn't bother to explain what they were congratulating him _for_), but not a word from Eithan. And then when he comes back Huan discovers that the problem children who Eithan adopted over Huan's objections have also become more powerful than anyone else in the Empire. All of this is actually great for Huan, but he's just _so annoyed_ at Eithan. Yerin suggests Eithan let Huan kick him. Huan kicks him over the mountains.

-   _Arrow_
    -   In the Season 3 climax, John Diggle punches Oliver Queen for kidnapping his wife while pretending to be a brainwashed member of the League of Assassins.

-   Done in _Party of Five_, when Will realizes that his girlfriend Sarah is still in love with his best friend Bailey, and vice versa. He breaks up with Sarah, gives Bailey his blessing to pursue the relationship - and then punches him in the stomach.
-   _Friends_. Joey, to apologize for fake proposing to Rachel, offers Ross one of these. Joey then goads Ross into doing so, who throws the punch and hits the metal pole behind Joey, who had ducked.

Then, as they leave to go to the hospital, Joey accidentally hits Ross _again_ with the door. Seen here.
    -   Later he again tries to demonstrate by punching Chandler. He ducks, so Joey ends up punching Ross **again**.
-   Played for laughs unexpected laughs in _Kamen Rider Double_. In an episode about halfway through the series, Ryu Terui gets his Berserk Button pressed by the Weather Dopant and starts treating the other protagonists harshly, which has the indirect effect of getting The Hero badly injured in a fight.

Later Shran double-crosses Archer on the orders of his government and tries to apologise, reminding him that he still owes Archer and will deliver at a future date. Archer responds by decking Shran. "I've owed you that one for a long time!"
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: In the 2nd season episode "A Matter of Honor", Riker, on an officer-exchange program with a Klingon ship, has to employ trickery to oust the captain from command in order to prevent a deadly misunderstanding with the Enterprise (the normal Klingon procedure would be to assassinate him). When he yields command back at the end of the episode, he accepts a punch to the face from the Klingon captain; while it's unlikely the captain exactly forgives him, it does even the score, satisfying Klingon honor and letting the captain recover some dignity after the embarrassment.

In "Proper Preparation and Planning", Hughie Campbell tackles Billy Butcher just as he's about to shoot Kimoko's brother, a super-terrorist who then proceeds to bring half the building down on their heads. Butcher is understandably furious and tries to throw Hughie out of The Boys, but the others refuse to go along with this. At the end of the episode, it looks like Butcher and Hughie will reconcile, but instead Butcher knocks him to the ground and threatens to kill Hughie if he gets in his way again. The next episode starts with Butcher trying to apologise. Hughie takes a wild swing at him, then just keeps on hitting in a rage until he's pulled off by Mother's Milk. It's not until Butcher saves his life during the episode that Hughie actually does forgive him.
-   The final episode of _Ultraman Orb_ has this between Gai Ikari and Jugglus Juggler, with Gai punching Juggler for all the crap Juggler had done over the series, followed by a hug and thanks for saving Naomi as well as Naomi's ancestor, Natasha.

After Luzzu gets up and goes off to fight Sin, Wakka tells him to come back alive.
    
    **Luzzu**: You're just saying that so you can punch me some more, aren't you?  
    **Wakka**: Lots, lots more!

-   Played with in _Just Cause 3_. When Rico confronts Mario about having turned to the Agency for communications gear for the rebels and lying to him about it, Mario tearfully apologizes. Rico forgives him... then slaps him in the dick and pushes him into the sea. However, the scene plays the physical remonstration less as a punishment and more like an extravagant, if somewhat fratboyish, in-joke.
-   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC_: Not really a punch, but a slap. Joshua gets one from his foster father, Cassius, for running away and trying to sever all ties with his allies.
-   Garrus' loyalty mission in _Mass Effect 2_ includes a scene where Garrus confronts the ex-C-Sec officer who helped hide the man who betrayed Garrus' vigilante team to their deaths on Omega.

As Shepard and Co. walk away, Garrus has this to say:
-   In _Mortal Kombat_, Kung Lao's ancestor was slain by Goro in Mortal Kombat, leading to a feud between Kung Lao's family and Goro. Kung Lao and Goro eventually agreed to make peace, but Kung Lao punched Goro at the meeting. Goro initially thought Kung Lao wanted to continue the fight. Kung Lao just did it to let Goro know that he hadn't forgotten the bad blood between them but he was still willing to let it end there.
-   In _Persona 5_, Ryuji is on bad teams with the rest of the former track team because he punched Kamoshida, resulting in the track team getting shut down.

They eagerly accept and seem to forgive him.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   Happens in _Tales of Legendia_ to Moses. Senel really lets him have it, right before he joins the party, for kidnapping Shirley earlier in the game.
    -   Exaggerated in _Tales of Vesperia_. Instead of killing The Mole for very nearly getting the party killed themselves, he is told that his life belongs to Brave Vesperia now, and then every single party member present takes turns walking up and decking him. He ends up getting hit four times in a row (_five_ in the Updated Re-release, thanks to the addition of Patty), with only Repede not doing so by virtue of the fact that he's a dog (though the Updated Re-release has the other new teammate, Flynn, abstain too; since he's a Nice Guy and had been manipulated by the villain like The Mole was).

-   Apparently, this is SOP for the ferrets of _DMFA_. When Wildy-San publishes a slash-fic novel starring Jyrras as the main character, Jyrras is royally pissed off. Wildy, faced with an angry friend, offers him a free shot at her to make it up, but being a gentleman, Jyrras of course refuses. Later, the episode is mentioned when she visits her brother, Biggs... he's amazed that ANYONE would pass up a chance to get a free shot at Wildy. ('tis true, too. He could probably have made a fortune if he'd auctioned out that free shot... not that he needs the money.)
-   In _Pv P_, when Brent is willing to reconcile with Cole over a matter, he says "man code demands I punch you with a significant force." Both men admit, however, that Brent is too weak to punch _anything_ with significant force, so he arranges for a proxy to do it - his wife, Jade.
    
    **Jade:** ...Head or stomach?
    
    **Cole:** I don't want to do this anymore.
    
    **Brent:** Yeah, I'm having second thoughts myself.
    
-   In _Manly Guys Doing Manly Things_, after Commander Badass recovered from the Nomura Syndrome incident, he went back to his Spacefuture handlers responsible to chew them out for it. The Admiral points out that between all the other concessions Commander had wrangled from them for prior transgressions, there was basically nothing, at this point, he could ask them for. Commander suggests this trope, and wins One Free Punch to the Admiral's face, to be delivered at his own discretion, at an undisclosed time of his own choosing.
    
    **Soldier:** I dunno, doesn't sound as satisfying as walloping him right there.
    
    **Commander:** It ain't about me hittin' him, it's about him knowing they're gonna _let me._
