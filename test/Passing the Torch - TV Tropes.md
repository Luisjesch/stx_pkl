A literal and figurative pass of the hat.

_"Take up our quarrel with the foe:  
To you from failing hands we throw  
The torch; be yours to hold it high."_

The Hero decides to leave the business. Perhaps the thrill is gone. Perhaps he wants to settle down and marry more than he wants to adventure. Perhaps he knows that age or injury has slowed him down too much; he can not do the job anymore.

But the job has to be done. It's time to pick a successor.

The Hero, therefore, formally hands the work over to someone else who can do the job. Perhaps a sidekick promotion or a former apprentice. A Legacy Character may involve this.

Usually, the _immediate_ problem is gone, and the hero is leaving on a high note, but both he and his successor are aware that the problem or that type of problem will happen again; he has not fixed the world. Therefore, the Master-Apprentice Chain is about to take effect.

If the hero wants to leave, this can form a Happy Ending. The less he wants it, the more a Bittersweet Ending it is.

Differs from Take Up My Sword in that the hero is still around and may be up to the role of Old Master. If the hero dies very quickly afterward, it can overlap with Take Up My Sword. However, it usually happens in the beginning or middle of a story; Passing The Torch is usually an Ending Trope. The only time it can happen at the beginning is if he were the hero in the backstory (or prior installment) and in the main story is already the Mentor Archetype.

May be physically embodied in an object that the retiring hero gives the new one.

The inversion of 10-Minute Retirement and He's Back!.

A Sub-Trope to Changing of the Guard, where the role of main character changes for any reason or by any procedure. Passing the Torch requires either the Hero to be part of the succession planning and/or handing off the office either personally or by explicit proxy.

The change happened on-camera in the special episode "The Old Switcheroo" (coinciding with the party falling through a portal to Ravnica) just before the PAX Unplugged 2018 live show. Perkins' decision to step down was, according to Crawford, motivated by his heavy workload at WotC, the necessary travel schedule, and the "intense anxiety" of running the live games at PAX.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Lou Thesz wanted to pass the National Wrestling Alliance World Heavyweight Championship belt to Rikidozan, but as the champion, who he defends it against and where were decided by the collective votes of the NWA members and Rikidozan was based in Japan, which only has one, this obviously did not happen. So Thesz decided to pass the World Heavyweight Title to his student, Dick Hutton, and created the NWA _International_ Heavyweight Title for the purpose of losing it to Rikidozan, who was forever grateful. Rikidozan went on to become quite possibly the biggest star pro wrestling has ever seen, but Hutton was deemed a weak draw with no charisma by the NWA and replaced with Pat O'Connor, who ran into legal troubles and was succeeded by Buddy Rogers, who pissed off so many promoters they asked Thesz to come back, which Thesz did.
-   Pretty much every wrestler with a Tiger Mask gimmick or some derivative of it was approved of by Satoru Sayama, except the Black Tigers, of course.
-   Yoshiaki Fujiwara to Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki, whom he deemed his top students in professional wrestling and mixed martial arts. Suzuki also has strong allusions to Karl Gotch. Masakatsu Funaki would go on to pass it to Yuki Kondo, which sadly ended up not going too far in retrospect.
-   Randy Savage set up his own wrestling promotion for the purpose of losing to Antonio Banks. While said company folded before this could actually take place, Banks would take note and later pass the torch to Kofi Kingston in WWE (not that it did much good in the long run).
-   Eddie Guerrero had such a moment with Low Ki, insisting that Low Ki beat him clean at Impact Championship Wrestling.

-   In the March 14, 2016 episode of Monday Night RAW, Mick Foley comes to Dean Ambrose and not only tells him to take him a tour of all the pain he's been through over the years, but gives him a little something extra. That extra is the barb wire bat!
-   On _Raw is XXX,_ the January 23, 2023 30-year anniversary of WWE Raw, The Undertaker made his first appearance onscreen after his official retirement two years previous, coming out as his more true-to-self American Badass persona to interrupt LA Knight in the middle of one of his characteristic self-aggrandizing promos. When Knight wisely tried to cut his losses and leave, Bray Wyatt hemmed him back into the ring from the ramp, where Undertaker immediately proceeded to grab Knight by the throat in preparation for a Chokeslam...only to throw Knight to Wyatt as the latter entered the ring, letting him do the deed with a Sister Abigail instead. With Knight legally dead at this point, Undertaker moved past Wyatt, briefly whispered something in his ear, and left the ring to ride out on his bike, finally passing the supernatural torch he held as the Deadman to the man nearly the entire wrestling universe agreed deserved it the most.

    Roleplay

If they retire voluntarily, the player's next character starts with a hefty XP boost, as they're assumed to be the veteran's protégé.

    Toys 

-   In _BIONICLE_, Turaga are created when Toa do this. This serves a number of simultaneous purposes: a new generation of Toa can appear, the wisdom and guidance of the prior generation of Toa is preserved and passed down, and it also allows the Toa to use a Game-Breaker like giving up their powers so as to save all of the known Matoran from Makuta's sleep spell.

    Video Games 

-   _Kira☆Kira_: Curtain Call, Shikanosuke's sister, Yuko, becomes the bassist of d2b after Shikanosuke graduates, even donning a similar stage costume.
-   _King's Quest_:
    -   _King's Quest III_: Subverted in the ending (and the beginning of _King's Quest IV_). Graham, swept up in the joy of being reunited with both his children, takes off his trusty adventurer's cap and tosses it at them, with the idea that the one who catches it will take up adventuring. He ends up having a heart attack as it's in mid-air. The cap falls to the floor, and neither child picks it up. It does, however, lead into Rosella setting off to save her dad, and putting the hat back on him on her triumphant return, saying her dad's still got a few more adventures in him. She turns out to be right.
    -   _Kings Quest (2015)_ ends like this too, except Graham's death from old age is final this time — no magic fruit, no last-minute save, and it's his grand-daughter Gwen who is taking up his cap.
-   _Left 4 Dead 2_: After Bill dies, the original survivors stop trying to get to the military and are now heading to the island, resulting in them sort of passing the torch to the new survivors. There's even achievement saying it after to beat the Passing.

-   _inFAMOUS 2_: In the evil ending, Cole decides to side with The Beast in his Well-Intentioned Extremist methods of saving humanity by activating Conduits and curing them of the plague at the cost of killing anyone who isn't a Conduit. After the RFI, the only thing capable of stopping him, is destroyed, The Beast reveals that he hates what he's become and only did what he did because he didn't have a choice, so he opts to transfer his powers to Cole so that he could see their plan through and the former can finally die.
    
    **The Beast:** Cole, I cant... I can't do this anymore.  
    **Cole:** What? After all this?  
    **The Beast:** No! I believe in the plan, but I'm so tired. I've had enough killing. I should have died a long time ago.  
    **Cole:** John...  
    **The Beast:** But I know you. If I gave you the power, you would see it through.
    
-   _Dark Souls_: In the very beginning, you meet Almost Dead Guy Oscar, knight of Astoria, who asks you to ring the Bells of Awakening in his stead.
-   _Thief: Deadly Shadows_: The ending strongly hints towards this, although anything definite is purely in the realm of fan speculation.
-   In _Kirby Star Allies_, Bugzzy's Guest Star description reveals that he has retired from his position as the "king of insects" following his near 10-year absence from the series since _Kirby Super Star Ultra_, and has passed down the role to fellow insect Beetley.
-   In _Mass Effect_, David Anderson is revealed to have been a candidate for the position of first human Spectre, but because of Saren's hatred of humanity, he intentionally sabotaged the mission that was meant to prove Anderson's worth. Twenty years later, Anderson's protege, Commander Shepard, picks up where their mentor left off; being made a Spectre in order to track Saren down after he publicly went rogue and began attacking human colonies. Saren and Anderson's history is first mentioned by the latter as he hands command of _The Normandy_ to Shepard, solidifying the change of guard.
-   Several examples in the _Assassin's Creed_ games. In the second game, Giovanni Auditore da Firenze is arrested on trumped up charges of treason (naturally, the Templars are behind this). When his son Ezio visits him in jail, Giovanni tells Ezio about a secret room behind the fireplace and the chest there. In the chest, Ezio finds his father's assassin robes and weapons. Unfortunately, he lacks the necessary training to save his father and brothers from execution. In the third game, Achilles Davenport is an old man living out the rest of his days in his homestead having failed to keep the Templars out of the New World. Along comes a half-Mohawk boy seeking to save his people and avenge his mother's death. Downplayed in that it takes many years of training before Achilles deems Connor ready to put on the robes of the first New World Assassin, which were passed down to Achilles himself. Oh, and that moment is when Connor finds Achilles's body in his house, having finally succumbed to old age. At the end of _Assassin's Creed: Revelations_, Ezio strips off his Assassin gear and uses an Apple to communicate with his descendant Desmond, effectively passing him the torch.
-   Twenty minutes into _Phantasy Star Nova_, your captain, Magnus, dies. Action Girl Fieldia subsequently takes Magnus's place as captain of your ship.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_, Tribunal deity Vivec, having spent the last 4000 years watching over and protecting the people of Morrowind, passes this responsibility onto the Nerevarine at the end of the main quest.
    
    **Vivec:** _"There are lesser monsters and villains of all kinds who prey upon the people... The Tribunal and the Temple are happy to yield to you the duties of fighting the enemies of Morrowind."_
    
-   This is a Central Theme in _Final Fantasy V_. It turns out that the "Light Warriors" of this generation are following in the footsteps of the Dawn Warriors who previously fought Exdeath. In fact, Galuf turns out to _be_ one of them, and Bartz's deceased father was one too. When the party meets the other two surviving members, they each pull a Heroic Sacrifice and entrust their responsibility to the new generation, as does Galuf when he eventually falls in battle and passes his abilities on to his granddaughter. At the Final Battle, their spirits appear before the Light Warriors, giving them one last boost and congratulating them on achieving a final victory over Exdeath once it's over.
-   In _Bloodborne_, when you finish her questline, Eileen the Crow retires from the hunt and gives you her equipment.
-   _Sakura Wars (2019)_ follows Sumire Kanzaki, a former soldier in the Imperial Combat Revue, leading a new generation of the Revue in protecting Tokyo. In the game's climax, Sakura Shinguji, the series's original female lead, saves Sakura Amamiya from the Archdemon, passing the torch to her with words of encouragement: "The stage awaits!"
-   In _Wildermyth_, heroes age visibly in the multi-year periods of peace between chapters, and while they'll see through the current chapter once they hit their retirement age, they withdraw from battle permanently afterwards. The party's name and legacy, and the responsibility of permanently resolving the campaign, is handed down to younger heroes recruited along the way - potentially including the retiring hero's child(ren). A three-chapter campaign isn't quite long enough for your original characters to bow out before the ending, but longer campaigns will be finished by the second or possibly even third generation of heroes.
-   This is an important mechanic in the _World Neverland_ series. Your character will eventually get old and die, so you'll need to pass on to one of their children. If you pass on to one of your children, that child will inherit all of your items and money, but not all of your stats, and will be able to do certain things you yourself couldn't.
-   Towards the climax of _Yakuza: Like a Dragon_, key characters from the Kiryu saga make appearances, and lend their support to new protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. This includes Kiryu himself. This is somewhat subverted after beating the superboss, where Kiryu (who orchestrated the fight between Ichiban and Shin Amon) states that rather than the successor of his legacy, Ichiban should be seen as his own man walking his own path. The Penultimate Chapter is even titled "Passing The Torch" since it involves Kiryu challenging Ichiban and his crew to a fight as his way of testing their worthiness.
    
    **Kiryu:** Good luck out there, Kasuga. You're gonna do great.
    
-   _Resident Evil 6_ In the final chapter of Chris' campaign, he tells his protegé Piers Nivans that he can't let the war follow him forever, and decides he's going to retire after they rescue Jake Muller, hoping that Piers can take his place in the BSAA team. Subverted in the end, as Piers is forced to perform a Heroic Sacrifice to ensure Chris's survival, and Chris decides to forgo his retirement and continue fighting in his friend's memory.
-   The Imperial China chapter of _Live A Live_ deals with an aging martial artist attempting to find a successor to pass his teachings onto and finds three disciples. Eventually, event happen that lead to two of the disciples getting killed by a rival school with the Sole Survivor becoming the Earthen Heart Master upon the master's death.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_ has a subplot about the ghost of a previous hero appearing before Link to pass down his sword arts so that he can ease his regrets about not passing them down in life. _Hyrule Historia_ reveals that the ghost in question is the Hero of Time, the Link who appeared in _Ocarina of Time_ and _Majora's Mask_.
-   The _Galaxy Angel II_ trilogy has this trope happening in some form on each one of the installments.
    -   In Zettai Ryouiki no Tobira, Tact Mayers, the protagonist of the original _Galaxy Angel_ trilogy gives Kazuya Shiranami a telepathic fur that he can use to read the Rune Angels emotions, entrusting him with caring for them just like Tact did to the Moon Angels in his time.
    -   In Mugen Kairo no Kagi, Tact is transferred out of the Luxiole to become Chief of the UPW organization, and his position as the ship's commander is given to Coco Nutmilk, his chief operator. Tact actually gives Coco a holographic message with his thought patterns to cheer her up when she's feeling unsure of being able to lead the ship as effectively as Tact, and she manages to embrace her role.
    -   Eigou Kaiki no Toki has the biggest one: in order to save Planet Val-Rundal from a black hole, Tact and the Moon Angel Wing end up having to sacrifice the Elsior and their Emblem Frames, thus officially passing the torch to their successors in the Luxiole and the Rune Angel Wing.
-   _Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach_: The _Ruin_ DLC reveals the official line Fazbear Entertainment took regarding Bonnie's replacement in the band with Monty was him deciding to retire and passing his bass on to Monty. Fans still complained, wanting Bonnie back, leading management to try to Unperson Bonnie as much as possible and push Monty as the Superior Successor. The implication that Monty actually _killed_ Bonnie to get his spot in the band makes this worse.
-   _Yandere Simulator_: After Budo defeats the previously undefeated Raibaru in a sparring match, she passes her bandana and leadership of the Martial Arts Club to him and quits, feeling she could finally pursue other interests now that she's been defeated. She would soon befriend Osana, making her a difficult obstacle for Yan-chan to overcome in her quest for Senpai.

    Webcomics 

-   Eugene Greenhilt in _The Order of the Stick_, passes on the quest to kill Xykon to his son Roy when he gets too old to carry it out. He has an ulterior motive though; Eugene swore a Blood Oath to kill Xykon, so he can't move onto the afterlife until the lich is dead.
    -   It's subverted in that the prequel _On The Origin of PCs_ shows Eugene doesn't think Roy can do it. He just told Roy about the oath so Roy can tell his little sister (who took up wizardry) and have her do it. Bonus content in print collections show that even now he just hopes the best Roy can do is find some useful intel on Xykon.
-   In _Pacificators_, it's very strongly implied to be the case between Daryl Smithson and her very famous grandmother Helen. Helen has given Daryl her special staff, and Daryl is strongly implied to have inherited her grandmother's talents.
-   _Magick Chicks_: Faith abdicates her position as student council president to Melissa, near the end of chapter 15, after learning she'd been subconsciously effecting the rest of the student body.

-   In the _Red Panda Adventures_, after coming back from fighting behind enemy lines in Europe, the Red Panda starts operating with an eye towards retirement once the World War II is over and things have settled down.

However the DF is spread out across Canada and Mr. Amazing doesn't survive the war. A successor is eventually found in the form of the Black Eagle, whose secret identity is someone who has been in the Red Panda's circle since he was a little boy.

    Web Video 

-   _Game Grumps_ did this when introducing new editor Kevin Abernathy to the fans.

When it becomes clear that Batman isn't as efficient as he used to be; Nightwing suggests maybe it's time to pass the torch. Batman however, being the stubborn bastard he is, replies that he would pass the torch when "the mission" (i.e. to ensure Gotham's protection) is over, to which Nightwing dryly notes will never happen.
-   _Batman Beyond_: Terry McGinnis takes up the mantle of Batman some years after aging had forced Bruce Wayne to retire. It's downplayed in that Bruce isn't completely gone from the scene, acting the role of Mission Control. When Barbara Gordon (former Batgirl, now commissioner) returns to the Batcave to warn Batman, she isn't sure which of them she should be speaking to.
-   _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_: The Season 2 episode "The Knights of Tomorrow!" has a vision of a future where an older Batman get married to Catwoman and starts a family. He then passed the mantle of Batman to Nightwing, and it gets passed down the line.

-   _Fish Hooks_: Halfway through the second season, Nurse Fishington becomes the new principal of Freshwater High after Stickler leaves.
-   _Gravity Falls_ (the image provider): In the Grand Finale, Soos overhears Stan and Ford discussing their plan to shut down the Mystery Shack so they go on the adventures they yearned to go on since childhood, and is deeply upset by this. He then gives a Rousing Speech so inspiring to Stan that it gives him the idea to give Soos the job as the new manager. In fact, this was actually foreshadowed back in Season 1's "Little Dipper".
-   _Hammerman_: The premise of the show revolves around a retired hero passing the torch to a successor, the main character.
-   _Hot Stuff_: A literal version of the trope occurs when the first person to possess fire passed it on to future generations in this manner.
-   _Kim Possible_: This is both subverted and parodied in the Season 2 episode "The Fearless Ferret", when Timothy North reveals that he was once "The Fearless Ferret" and convinces Ron Stoppable to take up the Ferret mantle (fun fact: Will Friedle played both Ron and Terry McGinnis). It's later revealed that North was just an actor in a series who became deluded when his show was canceled.
-   _The Legend of Korra_: An elderly Katara essentially does this to Korra, since as the world's latest Avatar after Aang, she and her friends now serve the world's peacekeepers and protectors, just as Katara and her friends did back in their youth.
    
    **Katara:** Aang's time has passed. My brother and many of my friends are gone. It's time for you and your generation to take on the responsibility of keeping peace and balance in the world. But I think you're going to be a great Avatar. Goodbye, Korra.

-   _Thomas & Friends_: At the end of the special, _The Adventure Begins_, Glynn, the original #1 engine, passes down his branch line and his number to Thomas.
    
    **Glynn:** Look after the branch line, Thomas, and wear that number with pride!
    
-   _The Venture Brothers_: In the Season 4 episode "Any Which Way But Zeus", Desmond, Captain Sunshine's butler is revealed to have been the original Captain Sunshine, and the modern one was his Wonderboy. Dragoon states that he arched him back in the 1960's in his heyday. Of course he has retained all his powers but is still a weak old man.
-   _Winx Club_: Nebula has become the new Queen of Tir Nan Og after Morgana stepped down from the throne.
-   _Young Justice_:

    Real Life 

-   Some comic book creators who have the full rights to the property they created willingly pass the torch of continuing their series to others once they step down. This was the case for Asterix, when Albert Uderzo appointed Jean-Yves Ferri and Didier Conrad to continue the series.
-   The whole reason for a new creative team taking over _Star Wars_ after Disney bought Lucasfilm. George Lucas was batting around the idea of a sequel trilogy for years but couldn't decide if he should go through with it or move on to other projects. When Disney approached him about making a sequel series he decided to pass on his creation to the next generation of filmmakers, thus keeping the universe he created alive while allowing him to retire from the franchise (of course the alternate theory is that Lucas was Kicked Upstairs after Disney bought Lucasfilm, and they proceeded with or without his approval, though with a person who worked closely with Lucas before, Kathleen Kennedy).
-   A not-uncommon scenario for classic characters is for their roles to be inherited by the mentees of the original actors and performers
    -   Jimmy MacDonald and Clarence Nash had trained Disney animation staffers Wayne Allwine and Tony Anselmo to take on the roles of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, roles Allwine and Anselmo inherited from their predecessors after their retirements.
    -   This is the standard operating procedure for The Muppets, both on projects relating to _Sesame Street_ and _The Muppet Show_; when a Muppet performer begins to retire or decline in health, they will geneally begin the process of handpicking their successor and allow them to ease into their characters. Frank Oz picked Eric Jacobson to succeed him in most of his roles, while Caroll Spinney and Jerry Nelson similarly picked Matt Vogel to take on most of their famous characters (in the case of Vogel, he would physically perform characters like Big Bird and the Count, while Spinney and Nelson recorded their voices in post, taking over the roles completely after their passings).
    -   When Daws Butler died, _Yogi Bear_ and a number of his other Hanna-Barbera characters were inherited by Greg Burson, who Butler personally trained in his voice-acting class.
-   Pythagoras originally had to pay his first student to teach him. Eventually, when he saw that his student was genuinely interested, he told him he was too poor to continue paying him, so the student offered to pay him instead to continue the lessons. Eventually, his circle grew as he took on more and more students.
-   Often happens when a current head of state retires and is succeeded by a new head. Among U.S. presidents, William Howard Taft gets special mention for becoming the Chief Justice after his presidency and personally swearing successors Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover into office.
