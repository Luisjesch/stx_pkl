_"When will they see that the Horde exists BECAUSE of the Alliance? Because of their prejudice and their bigotry!? They force us ever closer to Hellscream’s Horde!"_

All right, you know the drill: Two or more groups of aliens really hate each other not for concrete differences but over Fantastic Racism. Cue a new kid on the block that threatens both. Cooler heads prevail and they team up against the new guys, in the process they learn a valuable lesson about tolerance and embrace The Power of Friendship. Pretty standard plot and Aesop, except for one tidbit. The new guy? That's Humanity. Either because of real or perceived threat, these alien races have banded together into an Anti-Human Alliance with the goal of either conquering and enslaving us or outright wiping us off star-charts.

Despite the space focus, this trope can be used in any setting with one or more non-human races. In Fantasy it's usually a group of evil races such as orcs, goblins, undead, etc. However "good" fantasy critters may despise humans for their own reasons, such as fairies, elves, dryads, etc. It's especially common to have post-humans form such an alliance, such as Mutants, Cyborgs, vampires, and people with superpowers. Better yet, the non-humans that want to kill humanity are its children, such as rebellious robots, A.I., and Designer Babies.

The motivating factor behind this alliance can vary, here are a few common causes:

-   Humans taste really good, so enslaving us en-masse is in their interest.
-   They see us as a threat to their empire or race.
-   They are Fantastic Racists who consider us inferior and weak, fit only to be wiped out.
-   They need slaves for the ice mines on Chiron Beta Prime.
-   Humans have exhibited Fantastic Racism on them, potentially trying to wipe them out or enslave them.
-   Humans treat _them_ as delicious/worth enslaving, so preventive genocide (or slave rebellion) is on the table.
-   They've observed or otherwise learned human history from afar, and are appropriately horrified or terrified.
-   They were once human and want to lord it over the rest.

Depending on the tone of the series, these differences may be resolvable or ultimately lead to endless war and conflict until one side finally kicks the bucket. It's also worth noting that humanity may have one or two non-human allies that are being equally targeted for helping us out.

See also Alike and Antithetical Adversaries, Equal-Opportunity Evil, Enemy Mine and Gang Up on the Human. May result in a Genocide Backfire because ultimately, at least one human will survive.

Contrast Creature-Hunter Organization and Screw You, Elves! when the humans decide to fight back and form an organisation to repel the non-human races, and Absolute Xenophobe and Muggle Power when the non-human races aren't necessarily evil but the humans are still against them.
