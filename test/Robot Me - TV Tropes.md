The ultimate grudge match we've all been demanding!

**Bill:** Wow! Evil robot "us"es!  
**Ted:** Excellent!

A robotic version of an existing character. May have vastly different abilities and personality, especially if it's developed as an Evil Knockoff. Sometimes, this robot may simply be a stand-in for the original with a justification either sinister or mundane. The key point of this trope is for there to be interaction between the original and the robot, even if it is simply the original having knowledge of the robot's existence. If this is a retcon it's Actually a Doombot. If this robot is replacing the original, it's usually a Rotten Robotic Replacement.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Armitage III: Dual Matrix_ has robot _clones_ of the android lead. Their world has three kinds of robots, dumb mechanical ones, menial work bots, and the outlawed Thirds which are organic/mechanical robots and can bear children. Armitage herself is a Replacement Goldfish of their creator's dead daughter, and a Corrupt Corporate Executive steals her father's notes and makes more of her. Yech. Of course, since they were more like "twins" than Robot Me's, they were Evil.
-   _Ayame and Amane_ is a small series of two-page gags about a girl who is hilariously in love with her female schoolmate. Kamijou, the one in love, invests tons of money on her school's robotics club in hopes of creating a robot copy of her love interest Chiho, for personal use. While it ends up looking nothing like the actual person (except for a wig), it _does_ have a "sexy mode".
    
    **Mecha-Chiho:** Oh no how embarrassing. My D-Terminal connector fell out. Don't look. Don't look at my D-Connector that just fell out.  
    **Kamijou:** ... _\[to the robotics club\]_ Here's another 4,000. Please continue developing.
    
-   _The Big O_ has Dorothy R. Wainwright, who is a perfect android copy of late Dorothy Wainright, created by Dorothy's father as a Replacement Goldfish.
-   _Black Paradox_ have Piitan's robotic doppelganger, designed by Piitan himself who turns out to be so competent it outshines Piitan in every aspect. Then Piitan's soul ends up in his own robot.
-   Amanatsu from _Gakuen Alice_, Mikan's robotic copy as created by Hotaru.

-   _Perman_ by Fujiko F. Fujio (creator of _Doraemon_). Each of the three superheros (an everyday school kid, a girl child star — and a chimp) is given a morphing robot that serves as a stand-in, so that when they come back from their call, they don't have to answer the embarrassing question of "where have you been?".
-   In _Pokémon: The Series_, Clemont constructs a robot version of himself (called Clembot) to conduct Gym Battles. Unfortunately, when first activated, it went a bit power-mad. Clemont eventually fixed this problem and left the robot in charge of the Gym while he travels with Ash.
-   _Sgt. Frog_: The Keroro Platoon copy robots.
-   Hilariously Lampshaded in _Trouble Chocolate_ when Mint creates a killer robot version of Deborah and no one can tell it's not her (despite it being blindingly obvious). Even Murakata can't tell the difference.
-   The titular character from _How Clumsy you are, Miss Ueno_ creates a robot version of herself to trick Tanaka, who falls for it despite it obviously being a robot. This includes him commenting on her hair being hard (it's metal) and sticking out, after which it folds itself into the robots head. He just goes with it.
-   In episode 152 of _Ojarumaru_, Tommy makes an Ojarumaru robot called the "Mechanical Ojaru Doll" in order to help Aobee return Great King Enma's scepter from Ojarumaru. However, the plan fails by the end of the episode. The Mechanical Ojaru Doll appears again in episode 174 in which it gets sent by Tommy over to Kazuma's house. Ojarumaru befriends it and spends the remainder of the episode together with it.

    Asian Animation 

-   _BoBoiBoy_: BoBoiBot was made by Adu Du by using samples of BoBoiBoy's Elemental Powers. Given that he's purposed as a Rotten Robotic Replacement for the hero, BoBoiBoy is far from pleased.
-   _Bread Barbershop_: In the episode "Robot Wilk", Chip invents a robot Wilk to replace the real Wilk at work and eventually attack Master Bread.
-   _Crazy Candies_: In Season 2 episode 31, Marshyo and Jackey invent delivery robots that look much like them, albeit the Marshyo one has three pairs of arms instead of one. They both start to malfunction, leading to the Jackey one in particular consuming everyone and everything it can grab.
-   _Happy Heroes_: In Season 5 episode 10, Big M. sends a robot version of Doctor H. to the Supermen's house to gather data for him. This fails since the computer's eye scanner can't read the robot's pupils, so Big M. sends mind-controlled Doctor H. himself to go get the data instead.
-   _Motu Patlu_ does this at least twice.
    -   In "Robot Chingam", Dr. Jhatka invents a robotic version of Inspector Chingum. The robot will behave just like a given person if their hat is placed on it.

    Comic Books 

-   _G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (Marvel)_: One issue's plot revolved around Cobra having created new, extremely convincing robot duplicates of many world leaders and influential people. Snake Eyes, Scarlet, and Stormshadow got dispatched to infiltrate and destroy the factory before Cobra can produce enough robot duplicates to put their plans in motion. The three of them go in separate ways and find out that Snake Eyes has been replaced by a duplicate when he attacks Scarlet.
-   _Iron Man_: Tony 2.0 (Sentient Armor)
-   _InvestiGators_: After the events of Off the Hook, Brash is temporarily replaced by RoboBrash.
-   _Superman_:
    -   The Superman Robot Duplicates. Made by Superman to fill in when he's unavailable and help him maintain his secret identity. Their intelligence tended to vary a lot from one story to the next, but it was tacitly accepted that they were non-sentient and therefore disposable. When meddling aliens in one story cause one to (briefly) literally come to life, it's a big deal. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   When Supergirl arrived on Earth, his cousin made several duplicate robots for her. When Kara fought crime while living at Midvale Orphanage, she used a robot decoy of herself to keep the other orphans from noticing her absence.
    -   Post-Crisis Superman villain Conduit also uses robotic decoys of himself to distract the Man Of Steel.
    -   In _The Black Ring_, Lex Luthor's sidekick is a robot Lois. Exactly as creepy as it sounds.
-   _Supreme_: Supreme has the Suprematon Decoys. Unlike the Superman dupes, one of the Supreme's robots, S-1, is self aware, though.
-   Mecha-Dawn, from _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ Season Eight
-   The Archie's Sonic comics have Sonic temporarily _become_ one of these when Robotnik finally succeeds in roboticising him. Robotnik later uses the schematics to build Metal Sonic, Silver Sonic, etc.
    -   Recurring character Fiona Fox also had one of these, though in that case the android double was introduced before the original.
    -   Recently, one of Sonic's Robot Mes called Shard has undergone a Heel–Face Turn and is working with the Secret Freedom Fighters. His colour scheme reminiscent of Gemerl from Sonic Advance 3.
-   Doctor Doom's Doombots.
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   Kang's Spider-Man robot was made with the assumption it would not meet the original. The robot was created to trick _The Avengers_ into believing he was the real deal.
    -   In _The Sensational Spider Man_ #30, Spider-Man and Black Cat are made to fight robotic duplicates of themselves by the villain Arcade. They turn this plan against him by Spider-Man knocking out the robot Black Cat, allowing the real one to sneak up on Arcade and subdue him.
-   _Judge Dredd_: In the Judge Cal arc, the insane Cal uses a robotic copy of Judge Dredd to frame him for the unlawful murder of several citizens. Dredd is sentenced to Titan, but he escapes his transport and dispatches his duplicate to prove his innocence.
-   In one story from Wally Wood's _Sally Forth,_ the President of Rottenbad plans to substitute world leaders with robot duplicates.
-   _Kaijumax_ features both Zonn and Mecha-Zonn, the latter created in order to destroy the former. In the margins of the deluxe TPB, Zander Cannon notes that he actually designed Mechazonn first and so had to work a bit backwards to think of how to make Mechazonn’s body organic.
-   In book 4 of _Catstronauts_, "Robot Rescue", the Catstronauts disguise four robots and program to look and act like them so no one at C.A.T.S.U.P. would know they left to go on a Rescue Mission to Europa to retrieve Cat-Stro-Bot. They prove effective at passing themselves off... until they get wet.
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: Diana had Paula build a lifelike robotic Diana when Gen. Darnell scheduled Diana to give Wonder Woman an award at a ceremony. The robot had no AI and was instead controlled through a mental radio receiver, much like, but far more sophisticated than, the one in Diana's robot plane (better known as the Invisible Plane).
-   Sonic the Comic has many robot versions of Sonic and friends. The first was a Badnik designed to look like Sonic called the Sonic Badnik. The second robot Sonic seen is a damaged Silver Sonic on the Death Egg I (based on the Mecha Sonic from the Death Egg Zone). Grimer tried to use Amy to power a Super Badnik designed to look like her. After that failure, Grimer began work on Project Metallix, which resulted in the first Metallix (called Metallix the Metal Sonic) serving as the villain of the Sonic CD story. A second Metallix would be based on Mecha Sonic Mk II and be the brother of the first Metallix. After that, Project Metallix would be automated, producing thousands of Metallix which went rogue. They made a Porker Metallix to pose as Sonic friend and tried to erase Robotnik from history. After they were defeated, Grimer showed Robotnik his plans for a Knuckles Metallix (this is the first time a robot me of Knuckles would appear in any media). After Robotnik was overthrown, he built the Knuckles Metallix.

-   _Re: My Hostage, Not Yours_: When Gaz is supposed to travel to Australia with Dib to join their father for a family vacation/PR coverage following his latest project's completion, which would risk the progress Zim is making in getting the PAK off of her, Zim creates a robot duplicate to go in her place. Its AI is a perfect imitation of Gaz's personality to sell the illusion, though she can also remote control it if necessary.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Billy & Mandy’s Big Boogey Adventure_, Boogey's Dragon Mr. Creeper invents two robots of Billy and Mandy that he sends back in time at the beginning of the movie to make sure the real duo doesn't get the Artifact of Doom. Their voices are so heavily vocoded that every time they speak is accompanied by subtitles.
-   In _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - The Mythical Ark: Adventures in Love & Happiness_, Wolffy has a robotic version of himself named iWolffy who helps him. In the same film, iWeslie, a robotic version of Weslie invented by Mr. Slowy, helps the goats and wolves on their adventure.
-   In the _Gumby_ movie, the Blockheads set out to create robot copies of Gumby and his new bandmates, the Clayboys, in the hopes of coercing Gumby's dog Lowbelly into crying pearls in response to their rock music. The original characters are also locked inside a freezer after the replication process is done. When the Blockheads' plans are foiled, one of them reprograms robot Gumby into acting as their dragon to take down Gumby by force.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The Evil Robot Us-es and Good Robot Us-es from _Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey_
-   Mechani-Kong, who, much like King Kong greatly influenced Godzilla, would go on to inspire Mecha-Godzilla.

-   _Metropolis_: Robot Maria.
-   _Replicas_: Towards the end of the film William copies _his own_ consciousness and uploads it to a robot body. The human William gets to leave with his family, while the robot William goes off-grid to protect their research.
-   _Still Not Quite Human_ has the robotic Dr. (Jonas) Carson impostor, named "Bonus" by Chip once he gets hold of it.

-   In the 1979 Disney comedy _Unidentified Flying Oddball_ (aka _A Spaceman in King Arthur's Court_), the US government won't risk an astronaut to test a faster-than-light spacecraft, so the protagonist builds a robot version of himself to pilot it. Unfortunately they accidentally get launched into space (and back in time) together.
-   The second _Ultraman Zearth_ movie has a powerful robotic duplicate of the titular Ultra, codenamed Shadow Zearth, and is a _far more competent_ fighter easily defeating Ultraman Zearth in the opening. Most of the movie is dedicated to Zearth putting himself through a Training from Hell in order to defeat his robotic clone.

    Literature 

-   In the Ray Bradbury short story _Marionettes, Inc._, a man acquires a Robot Me to stand in for him at home while he goes away. (A very sophisticated robot that eventually develops sentience, but still one that, if you place your head to the chest, you can hear a clock ticking instead of a heart beating.) However, the robot decides that he likes the original man's life and doesn't want to be stored away in a box in the basement. The solution? He betrays his owner by locking HIM in the box forever while he (the robot) lives the life of the owner, his family completely unaware of the switch.

-   _The Adventures Of Electronic_ by Russian author E. Veltistov have a robot built after a real boy. The robot escapes and meets said boy, who is very happy to have his Robot Me go to school instead of him and then...
    -   The novel has spawned several sequels, one of which points out that, since a year has passed, the boy now looks older than Electronic. Then again, everybody is aware of Electronic, so nobody would confuse the two. Then there's the plug that's attached to Electronic to charge him.
-   Isaac Asimov
    -   In _The Caves of Steel_, R. Daneel Olivaw is a robot built to look exactly like his creator. Elijah Baley makes a joke that he was "made in his maker's image", but it's lost on the robot. It turns out this was a key point upon which the plot turned... How could a man psychologically incapable of killing a human kill a human? By thinking he's destroying the robot duplicate instead.
    -   "The Tercentenary Incident": The American President has a robot duplicate, visually and tactile identical to the original, it would be used when the President was shaking hands with the crowd, so that any attempts at assasination would be foiled by targeting the duplicate instead. This is significant when just that happens during the Tercentenary Incident.
-   A Spider Robinson short story about a company that rents sexbots makes one to represent the secretary who takes people's orders (because she ends up being the most popular request). She's rather upset about this and steals it. Then the inevitable happens.

-   There's a doppelganger in _Tough Magic_, a golem built of magitek, and programed to duplicate the main character's abilities and skills.
-   In _MARZENA_ we have Geni (General Intelligence) who is a digital clone of Marian created by Merging Minds with a Blank Slate. It's all still in Beta Stage of course, although digital clones are such a time saver you won't possibly be able to keep yourself from using them
-   In _The Snarkout Boys and the Baconburg Horror_, the heroes realize that Rat's family, whose butler turned out to the main villain Wallace Nussbaum in the last book, still have a butler who looks the same. Wallace Nussbaum claims that their current butler is an android clone of him, designed to do his bidding, but this turns out to be a bluff.
-   In the _Franny K. Stein_ book _The Fran With Four Brains_, Franny finds her bagpipe lessons, soccer practice and gourmet cooking classes to cut into her laboratory time, so she builds a trio of Franbots to handle these obligations in her place. Unfortunately for her, the Franbots go nuts and become so fixated on being excellent that they run Franny's mother ragged and respond to Franny's pleas that they slow down by turning Franny's dog Igor into a tuna fish sandwich and scheme to do the same to Franny, her family and the rest of humanity.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the _Buck Rogers in the 25th Century_ episode "Ardala Returns", the villains create an android version of Buck.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Buffybot(s). Specifically, it differed from the original in terms of being obsessed with Spike when it didn't go out on patrol, or even when it did. When it was reprogrammed it was closer to the way Buffy was, except that to call it a Cloudcuckoolander would be an understatement.
-   Unsurprisingly for such a long-lived show, _Doctor Who_ has done this more than once: there's the robot First Doctor created by the Daleks in "The Chase" as well as the android replicas of the Fourth Doctor and Sarah Jane in "The Android Invasion".
-   An episode of _The Fresh Beat Band_ has the band ordering robots of themselves to assist in picking berries. Because the show is for younger viewers A.I. Is a Crapshoot is averted, but the robots are ironically quite incompetent.
-   _The Mr. Potato Head Show_: Mr. Potato Head was under a lot of stress and needed a vacation, so Dr. Fruitcake made a robotic version of Mr. Potato Head to stand in for him while he was away...who was friendly and didn't have any of Mr. Potato Head's flaws. He was so liked by the rest of the cast, that when the real Mr. Potato Head found out about the robot, he didn't want to come back to the show and became depressed.
-   A robot Kermit (with a wind-up key in his back) took over hosting duties in one episode of _The Muppet Show_.
    -   Another robot Kermit was featured in a _Sesame Street_ "News Flash" segment from The '80s where kooky inventor Dr. Nobel Price "invents" what he calls "Sherman the Hoppity Hop." It even copies Kermit's trademark scrunched-up face!
-   Having accidentally killed Will Radcliffe with a copy of the _Complete Works of Shakespeare_, _Night and Day_'s Kate Ellis "hired a number of electrical engineers, and, with the latest nanotachnology and a lot of hard work", created a robotic replica - which looked uncannily like the human Will, covered in silver spraypaint. Naturally, Will's daughter Frankie is thrilled to have her dad back, particularly when he declares her 'the boss'.
-   _Kamen Rider_ had a couple of instances (in _Super-1_ and _Black RX_) where the villains made robotic duplicates of the hero, yet they were only used as glorified training dummies to prove the effectiveness of the new Monster of the Week.
-   Robot Rangers in both _Power Rangers Turbo_ and _Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue_. The former were Ridiculously Human Robots built by the originals to help protect an alien planet; the latter were mindless remote-controlled drones (with no "civilian forms" to make them seem more human) that... well, A.I. Is a Crapshoot.
    -   There is also Cyber Cam from _Power Rangers Ninja Storm_, a robotic knockoff of Cam.
    -   In the 25th Anniversary episode of _Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel_, Draven creates an army of robot Ranger copycats by building an android duplicate of Tommy Oliver and capturing other past Rangers. The real Tommy manages to destroy it by calling on the powers and skills of his previous Ranger forms, from the Black Dino Thunder Ranger all the way to the original Green Ranger.
    -   The Big Bad of the 30th Anniversary film _Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once & Always_ is Robo-Rita, a robotic duplicate of Rita Repulsa formed from the union of Alpha 8 and her cast-off evil after the original was purified by the Z-Wave and ascended to become the Mystic Mother.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   Android Kirk in the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "What Are Little Girls Made Of?".
    -   Data, Lore, and presumably all the other previous prototypes in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ are exact (if Palette Swapped) duplicates of their creator, Dr. Soong (also played by Brent Spiner, the actor who portrays Data, et al).
    -   As revealed in "Inheritance", Soong later created a much more human-looking Replacement Goldfish modeled after his deceased wife Juliana.
    -   In "The Offspring", when Data creates a "daughter" named Lal and allows her to choose her gender and appearance, she briefly considers taking on Counselor Troi's before Data tells her that it would be very confusing.
    -   A combination of this trope and Body Backup Drive is what Dr. Soong’s son, Altan does to Jean-Luc Picard upon his original body dying, with his consent in the first season finale of _Star Trek: Picard_, and to himself before the third season.
    -   Not technically a robot, but still an artificial intelligence: the Emergency Medical Holographic program (EMH) of _Star Trek: Voyager_ is modeled after creator Dr. Lewis Zimmerman.
    -   In the _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode "Dr. Bashir, I Presume", Dr. Zimmerman considers modeling his prototype Long-Term Medical Hologram's appearance and personality after Dr. Julian Bashir, who has a better bedside manner than Zimmerman.
    -   Generally speaking, it can be a little unsettling just how effortlessly and accurately the holodeck can emulate a specific real person, especially since the resultant holodeck character is usually presumed to be a nonsentient Empty Shell. If they're left running long enough, holodeck characters can sometimes achieve full sentience, though the cloning aspect of letting this happen to a hologram based on a living person aren't really addressed in the franchise.
-   _Stargate SG-1_: At one point robot duplicates of SG-1 are created by an alien. Later on, a human-form Replicator is created to look and act like Carter, who the fans dubbed Repli-Carter. Very much _unlike_ Carter, she was a Robotic Psychopath and a Galactic Conqueror.
-   _TekWar_: During his investigation, Detective Cardigan meets a Beth Kittridge who is an android duplicate of the original, with all her memories.
-   _Ultra Series_:
    -   _Ultraseven_: One of the last episodes of the show had Ultraseven battle a robot duplicate of himself with the same powers constructed by aliens called the Salome.
    -   Subverted in _Ultraman Ace_, which has a robotic clone of the titular Ultra, who instead of being used as an enemy, is instead a guinea pig to test the Cyborg monster Ace Killer's powers, having Ace Killer destroy Robot Ace in order to prove the monster's superiority.
    -   The Salome later reappeared in an _Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle_ and _Ultraman Zero_ special called _Ultra Galaxy Legend Gaiden: Ultraman Zero vs. Darklops Zero_, where they have a whole _army_ of Robot Ultrasevens (as well as several other Ultramen), as well as a Mechagodzilla-esque doppelganger of Rei's Gomora called Mecha-Gomora. Their main soldier is the titular Darklops Zero who goes rogue upon being reactivated, as it had been found rather than created by them and its true master is none other than Ultraman Belial. Belial later turns out to have an entire army of these things in _Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial_. Darklops Zero later appears in _Ultraman Geed_ as the second episode's monster of the week.
-   _Westworld_:
    -   One of the main characters, Bernard Lowe, is actually a host version of one of the late founders of the titular park, Arnold Webb. His partner, Robert Ford, built him as a loyal companion who wouldn't say "no". But after years of seeing the human guests abusing the hosts. Ford decides to let the hosts be free from human control and implants Arnold's memories on Bernard so that he can experience suffering and rise up from it so he can grow stronger and fight back against the oppressors.
    -   Season 2 reveals that this is the "true purpose" for the park as hinted at early in Season 1: Delos spent three decades using various forms of surveillance, including technology hidden in the headgear the Guests would wear, to "decode" them in an effort to achieve this. Essentially, a Host that would be a duplicate including memories and personality of a person effectively making them immortal. The problem as it turns out is that the human mind can't handle this transition due to it being limited and often the duplicates go insane. That said, it's demonstrated a couple of times that a Host can be built for replacing others and not go crazy by programming them with full knowledge they're not the original.
        -   The finale has Bernard building a host version of Charlotte Hale and put Dolores' control unit in her. Then, the Hale-host ("dubbed" Halores) kills the real Hale, poses as her when the Delos extraction team arrives and flees the park. In Season 3, she places a copy of her mind into the Halores who is able to pass herself off as the original but affected by the real Charolette's love for her family. After their death, whom she blames Delores for, "Hale" Jumps Off The Slippery Slope and decides to conquer and enslave humanity.
        -   Halores then proceeds to create a Host duplicate of their mutual Arch-Enemy William aka the Man in Black who also is aware he's just a copy and thus doesn't suffer from the Sanity Slippage duplicates. However, thirty years of pretending to be him causes him to grow beyond his programming and when they confront each other by the end declares himself William.
        -   Caleb, a main character introduced in Season 3, dies and the one audience is following throughout the first half of season 4 is a Host duplicate that's been going through a Fidelity Test by Hale, whose trying to understand the humans who can resist the mind control that she employs to control humanity. Like before, he starts to degrade especially after he learns the truth about what he is but the his love for daughter is enough to keep him going long enough to get her to safety.

    Manhua 

-   _My Beloved Mother_: The Raised by Robots protagonist, Sinbell, outright rejects his robotic mother, and even runs away from home to find his "real" mother, only to eventually realize she's right with him all along - Sinbell's biological mother sacrificed herself to save him from a gas explosion when he was four, and her last wish is for her conscience to be programmed into a robotic body, making Sinbell's robotic guardian his deceased mother's duplicate. She even shares the same memories as her original body.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Isaac Asimov's Robots_: In several conclusions to the game, realizing that Dr Han Fastolfe is actually R(obot) Han Fastolfe kicks off the attempted murder.

    Video Games 

-   _Shatterline_ has the Stilts, a tall, lanky monster on spindly legs, and it's mechanical counterpart, Cyborg Stilts, whose legs are coated in robot armor making it far more durable.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   _Mario Kart Arcade GP_ 1 and 2 has Robo Mario, who has a black version and silver version. His emblem on his hat shows E.Gadd's symbol, implying that E.Gadd created this robotic being. He is fought in a challenge on Rainbow Coaster in Rainbow Cup.
    -   The Mini-Mario toys from _Mario vs. Donkey Kong_ are a Red Shirt Army of these.
    -   In _Super Mario Sunshine_, the Boss Battle in Pinna Park is a giant robot resembling Mario's Arch-Enemy, Bowser, that breathes fire and sends Bullet Bills after Mario, who has to defeat it by shooting it with missiles from the F.L.U.D.D..
-   _Melty Blood_ features Mech-Hisui, who is a robot version of... Hisui, though you probably wouldn't be able to tell from a glance. She's a creation of Kohaku's, and features various weapons built into her, like grenades, chainsaws, and submachine guns.
-   The _Sonic the Hedgehog_ series has had many examples appear over the years, including:
    -   Both versions of _Sonic the Hedgehog 2_ have one -
        -   The Genesis game has one named "Mecha Sonic MK I,"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  who served as the penultimate boss battle in the Death Egg. It also shows up (or at least an incredibly similar robot does) in _Sonic Pocket Adventure_, though he's been demoted from penultimate boss status, as it's found in the third-to-last (or fourth if you count the True Final Boss) zone, Aerobase Zone.
        -   The Game Gear and Master System versions, meanwhile, have one called 'Silver Sonic' as the boss of the Scrambled Egg Zone, which is the Final Boss if you don't have all of the Chaos Emeralds. Silver Sonic makes a surprise appearance in _Sonic Mania_, though there he's simply a mook that appears in the second phase of the Metal Sonic fight (which are, incidentally, the only way to damage said boss).
    -   Metal Sonic, introduced in _Sonic the Hedgehog CD_, is easily the most well-known example, and is the only example that actually served as the Big Bad for a game, with his nearly successful attempt at taking over the world in _Sonic Heroes_.
    -   _Sonic 3 & Knuckles_'s Mecha Sonic MK II, Mecha Sonic MK I's upgraded model who can harness the power of the Master Emerald to go "Super".
    -   The Eggrobos, introduced in _Sonic 3 & Knuckles_, who are built in the likeness of Dr. Eggman's classic appearance.
    -   _Sonic R_'s Tails Doll and Metal Knuckles, built in the image of Tails and Knuckles, respectively.
    -   _Sonic Adventure_'s Mecha Sonic MK III appears in one of the status tubes with Metal Sonic in the other one.
    -   _Sonic Advance_'s Mecha Knuckles, who (initially) bore a closer resemblance to Knuckles than the above-mentioned Metal Knuckles.
    -   _Shadow the Hedgehog_'s Shadow Androids. They bare such a close resemblance to the original, that Shadow initially believes Eggman when he claims that Shadow is one of them.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   _Sonic Rivals 2_'s Metal Sonic 3.0, Dr. Eggman Nega's version with a color scheme reminiscent to that of Gemerl.
    -   _Sonic Chronicles_'s Egg Bot, who, unlike the Eggrobos, is based on Dr. Eggman's contemporary appearance.
    -   _Sonic Colors_' Virtual Hedgehogs, the playable characters in the Wii version's Sonic Simulator mode. They made a reappearance in _Sonic Lost World_ albeit with different designs.
-   The robot Invaders that assist Earth's Final Weapon in _Space Invaders Get Even_.
-   Miharu and robot Miharu in _Da Capo_. Miharu knew about her robo version but they never really interacted because the second Miharu only came out when she was in a coma. The personalities were almost exactly, but not quite, the same. Robo Miharu is also apparently somewhat less intelligent due to limitations on the design nor does she possess any superior strength or abilities.
-   Axel has an evil robot knockoff as a boss fight in _Streets of Rage 3_. The robot has the exact same appearance as Axel, except for the color of the gloves. The robot clone has all of Axel's techniques, and it can do them a _lot_ faster than Axel can.
-   _Metroid: Zero Mission_ introduces the aptly-named Mecha Ridley, a robotic version of Ridley, built by him. Given that it's incomplete (its leg and wing units are yet to be installed, meaning it has to drag itself along the ground to move), and _still_ serves as the Final Boss of that game, it's chilling to think of how devastating it could've been if it had been finished before Samus blew it up.
-   _Team Fortress 2_ has Mann vs. Machine, which is focused around fighting an entire army of these.
-   _Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution_. Naruto? Meet Mecha Naruto.
-   _Skullgirls_: A Gag Dub from Ms. Fortune's voice actor has led to the Memetic Mutation of Robo-Fortune, who eventually became a playable character, making her an Ascended Meme.
-   _Banjo-Kazooie_:
    -   In _Banjo-Tooie_, Mingy Jongo is this to Mumbo Jumbo.
    -   In the midquel, _Grunty's Revenge_, Klungo builds a Mecha Grunty suit for Grunty's spirit to escape into when Grunty was trapped under the boulder at the end of the original game. When the suit gets destroyed at the end of the game, Grunty's spirit goes back below the boulder to wait until Mingella and Blobbelda can get her out.
    -   In the multiplayer for _Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts_, players could control a robotic copy of Banjo as they competed in races with other players online.
-   Robot duplicates in the _Neptunia_ series are mainly one-shot characters with no other purpose other than for gags, most of them are a result of Nepgear's obsession with her sister and machines being amplified in the spin-offs.
    -   In one of Neptune's scenes in _Hyperdimension Neptunia: Producing Perfection_, the player wakes up and sees an android Neptune, which looks exactly like Neptune albeit only has one of Neptune's unique expressions for her face and speaks in a robotic manner, practicing dance steps while counting in French, while making mechanical noises. The player applauds the robot, mistaking it for the real Neptune despite noticing how different she acts. Nepgear later appears to take the robot to play with her. Later, the real Neptune shows up to greet the player and after a little bit of clarification, both of them decided to spy on Nepgear. It turns out, Nepgear was very lonely since Neptune always spends time with the player for her idol career that she built a robot Neptune that follows her orders while deluding herself that the robot is the real one. Neptune tries to fight the impostor but was quickly defeated in one blow. Nepgear only realizes the truth after the bruised Neptune crawls to her with the robot asking her for instructions at the same time. Neptune reassures Nepgear that she'll spend more time with her and then the robot, now called "Robo-Nep", was reprogrammed to be Neptune's rival in video games.
    -   Neptune's lily rank 6 conversation with Nepgear in _Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed_ has her greeting Nepgear before noticing a robot look-alike of her being tinkered by Nepgear, which she names as the "Stay-home Neptune Robot", which sits on her window sill.
    -   In _Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online_, Nepgear keeps begging Bouquet to show her a bit of her code. Neptune arrives and asks Nepgear on why is she begging for Bouquet for her A.I.'s code. Nepgear replies that it's for her Neptune robot, which Neptune immediately rejects.
    -   In _Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory Re;Birth3 V Generation_, a cutscene with MAGES. that isn't on the original game has Rom and Ram being intrigued with MAGES.' inventions. When they asked if she has a robot, MAGES. proudly presented her Nepgear robot, named "Docking Sister", which she built at Vert's request. However, she states that it was returned to her after the robot was reported to have a serious defect. When the twins ask what the robot's problem is, MAGES. answered by turning on the robot. The robot turns on and immediately malfunctions by making a "Nepgya" face while repeatedly saying "NEPUGIA!!" which bothered the twins. After turning off the robot, she says that she's willing to give away the robot for free, which they denied.
    -   It's possible that the robot reappeared in _Megadimension Neptunia VII_ as the DLC character "Nepgya" as one of her idle quotes mention of her ability to possess and her Backstory in the 4-koma has shown her to be a spirit that is once part of Nepgear before being turned into a real character by a poll. It could possibly mean that she possessed the robot and took control of it, which would explain on how she was able to fight and interact.
    -   In _Neptunia: Sisters vs Sisters_, there are enemies called "Mecha Dolls", which are androids that have the battle data of the Goddesses. The names of the units and color schemes are based on which Goddess their battle data is based off.
-   _Guilty Gear_ has Robo Ky, an attempt by the Post-War Administration Bureau to recreate Ky Kiske; however... it's an utter failure, as far as personality goes. While he borrows some of Ky's moves, he's gone on to develop a rather unique fighting style. He's also inspired the creation of several Robo- knock offs in _M.U.G.E.N_, with the most popular being are Robo Jam, Robo Sol, and Robo Rock Howard.
-   _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_ features an inverted example, Gear Rex is an organic Brute Wyvern version of Metal Gear REX.
-   _Xenosaga_ features KOS-MOS who has two other characters similar to her but they both invert it, T-elos who has Mary Magdelene's original body and Elma who is an organic alien version of her.
-   Nega-Toby from the _Battleborn_ DLC "Toby's Friendship Raid" is a robot copy of Toby that Thaddeus sent to deal with the penguin and the Rogues.
-   _ARMS_ has Springtron, a robot version of Spring Man designed by Dr. Coyle to be the perfect merciless fighting machine. Springtron is apparently an accurate enough robot copy of Spring Man that the two share the same unlocked ARMS inventory, and have the same rush mechanic, but here's the catch: Springtron is able to disable any fighter's ARMS that come in contact with his energy pulse, something Spring Man doesn't have.
-   _Katamari Damacy_ has the RoboKing, a Replacement Goldfish made by the Prince and his cousins after the King of All Cosmos was sent into a coma thanks to a falling meteorite. The RoboKing is a Ridiculously Human Robot whose personality is the opposite of the King's, being extremely depressed and insecure.
-   _Copy Kitty_: One of the exit messages mentions one, as a Suspiciously Specific Denial of use for the the combat training information that should remain private.
-   _Corridor 7: Alien Invasion_ have robotic versions of common alien enemies, like the Aliprobe and Animated Probe, and the Mechanical Warriors and regular alien mooks.
-   _Kirby_:
    -   _Kirbys Dream Couse_ has Robo-Dedede, piloted by the main King Dedede himself as the Final Boss.
    -   The giant King Dedede robot which originally appeared in the 2005 Kirby GCN trailer makes a surprise appearance in the Kirby Quest subgame of _Kirby Mass Attack_, retaining the same design and attacks.
    -   In _Kirby's Return to Dream Land_, another robot version of King Dedede reappears in the third level of Scope Shot. And despite the minigame getting removed and replaced by Booming Blasters in the remake, it still manages to reappear at Merry Magoland in the Egg Catcher minigame at the cost of being Demoted to Extra. HR-D3 also reappears from _Mass Attack_, fought as a Surprise Boss at the end of Egg Engines after defeating Metal General EX, sporting the same exact Red and Black and Evil All Over color scheme. Two other robots appear as enemies in the Scope Shot minigame: Waddle Tank and Mecha Kawasaki, both inspired from both Parasol Waddle Dee and Chef Kawasaki respectively.
    -   _Kirby: Planet Robobot_ features Metal Acro, obviously based on Acro from _Kirby's Dream Land 3_ and _Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards_. In the Extra Mode Meta Knightmare Returns, we get introduced to Stock Mecha Knight, a mass-produced version of Mecha Knight.
-   _Tiny Toon Adventures: Defenders of the Universe_ has Mech versions of Buster, Babs, Plucky and Hamton as a Unique Enemy encounter in the Mothership. Defeating them unlocks them as playable characters.
-   _Pâquerette Down the Bunburrows_: Ophéline creates Le Bunbot, a robot version of Pâquerette, which acts as an upgrade to instantly re-capture previously collected bunnies.

-   Twilight Sparkle builds the RDash-5000 in the _PONY.MOV_ series because if they can't have the real one, building one is the next best thing. It _immediately_ goes rogue and over the course of two more episodes somehow multiplies thousands of times over.
    
    **RD5000:** CRUSH. KILL. DESTROY. SWAG.
    
-   In the _Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse_ three-parter "Send in the Clones", Ken creates a robot clone of Barbie, in hopes that she can help Barbie complete her work more quickly.

Even worse, the tennis-playing robot accidentally breaks a control on the cloning machine, unleashing a slew of mindless Barbie robots on Malibu.
-   _Homestar Runner_:
    -   In the _Strong Bad Email_ "personal favorites", Strong Bad claims that Bubs once built a robot version of Strong Bad from an old Speak-and-Spell, a cereal box, and other assorted junk.
        
        **Grape-Nuts Robot:** _NOW SPELL "COME BACK ALI, COME BACK ALI'S SISTER"_.  
        **Strong Bad:** No way! That sounds just like me!
        
    -   In "hiding", Strong Bad is inspired to create a Back-Sassing Animatronic Strong Bad to distract Homestar and keep him from annoying Strong Bad. Despite Animatronic Strong Bad having only a vague resemblance to the real thing, Homestar is completely fooled.
        
        **BSASB:** Shut your mouth, wimp-cake!  
        **Homestar:** Hey, don't sass back at me! I found you fair, then square.  
        **BSASB:** Sit on a biscuit!  
        **Homestar:** Look, Strong Bad, I haven't been playing this game of hide n' seek for six weeks just to have you poor-sportsmanship all over the place now! Why, I've got half a mind!
        

    Webcomics 

-   _Ansem Retort_ has a one-off appearance by an android version of Zexion, set up to provide "political talking points" while Zex was otherwise occupied.

-   In the _Touhou Project_ doujin _Life of Maid_, Nitori makes a Robo-Marisa to screw around with Patchy's emotions. Marisa herself is surprised to discover her robotic clone after its head fell off.
-   From _Commander Kitty_, poor, poor Android Nin Wah. Making it even worse, androids in this universe are made by subjecting exact clones to Unwilling Roboticization. The original doesn't care for her much, and neither does anybody else, even though she's just as nice (or nicer) than her flesh-and-blood counterpart and slowly evolves more free will.
-   This hapens to many characters and many contexts in _Homestuck_. The robots generally resemble the characters, if they were made of metal:
    -   In the main comic, Jade's dream-bot is a robot version of her dream self, and shares the dream self's ditziness.
    -   Aradia, who was Dead All Along and introduced as a ghost, gets a blue-blooded robot body which she inhabits for the middle of the comic. Aradiabot is noticeably more violent and unstable than other versions of her.
    -   Dirk makes Jake a robot version of himself to spar with, which stalks him relentlessly and is highly effective in combat. The robot frequently kicks Jake's ass on hard mode, and gets uncomfortably sexual on easy mode. In many ways, the robot is quite similar to Dirk.
    -   In _The Homestuck Epilogues_, as part of ascending to their Ultimate Selves Dave and Rose get their consciousnesses transferred to robot bodies. It's part of a Gainax Ending so we don't see much of their personalities, but both appear more well-adjusted than they did in their meat bodies.

    Web Original

    -   In the King of Worms arc, the villain had several of Linkara's allies replaced with robot duplicates. This included Allen, Linkara's government liaison, whose robot double was identified by his agency quickly and simply monitored to prevent it from doing any damage - because they have protocols for this sort of thing.
-   _Professor Juice_: In her "Top 10 Robots in Gaming" list, R.O.S.I.E., a robot modeled after the real Rosie whose name stands for **R**obotic **O**perating **S**ystem **I**n **E**xcellence, tries to replace the real Rosie as the host, but she gets deactivated by the real Rosie as punishment.

    Western Animation

-   In the _Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog_ episode "Pseudo Sonic", Dr. Robotnik built the titular robot to wreak havoc on Mobius and frame Sonic for it. Unlike the robot Sonics from other media, this one was a vehicle piloted by Robotnik's lab rat Lawrence, who didn't want to make Sonic look bad, but was forced to under the threat of his parents being used as test subjects for Robotnik's "surface-to-Sonic" missile.

-   An unintentional case in _Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot_, where Legion Ex Machina creates a duplicate of the Big Guy. What they (and almost everybody else) don't realize is that the real Big Guy is just a guy in Powered Armor, as they could never get the AI to work. The Legion is surprised when the Big Guy's maintenance team starts banging on his back, asking for the pilot to get out.

-   The _Dudley Do-Right_ episode "Mechanical Dudley" has Snidley Whiplash create a robotic double of Dudley Do-Right with the intention to replace the real Dudley.

But it's savior of his country when the guns begin to shoot!" Of course, in true Jay Ward fashion, the robot Dudley turns out to be a better Mountie than the REAL Dudley!
-   Leela and Fry get one each in the _Futurama_ episode "Rebirth". Because the robots' personalities and memories are uploaded from Planet Express security footage, they each start out thinking they're the real people that they represent, leading to them happily running away together after they learn the truth.
    
    **Fry:** Uh, this is... a bit awkward. Or is it?  
    **Leela:** I'm not sure. I lost track around the second robot.

-   The British government once gave Danger Mouse and Penfold robot doppelgangers to help with their workload. However, the robots were mindlessly stupid. In another episode, one of Dangermouse's enemies, Dr. Crumhorn, covertly replaced Penfold with a robot double who was braver and more confident. The downside was that at Crumhorn's command, the robot would transform into a Humongous Mecha form and follow its true programming....destroy Dangermouse.
-   An _Inspector Gadget_ episode, "Doubled Agent", had M.A.D. come out with a robotic double of Inspector Gadget, complete with functional gadgets and the voice of Don Adams speaking in a Machine Monotone.

-   In the _Pac-Man_ episode "The Bionic Pac-Woman", the Ghost Monsters abducted Ms. Pac-Man so Mezmaron could replace her with a robotic clone, which Pac-Man would innocently take with him to the Power Pellet Forest. Here it overlaps with Acting for Two, as Barbara Minkus voiced both:
    
    **Ms. Pac-Man:** You're nothing but a cheap copy of _me!_  
    **Bionic Pac-Woman:** Wrong! I am better than you!
    
-   _Phineas and Ferb_
