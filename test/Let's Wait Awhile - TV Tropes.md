Did she just make _not_ putting out sound sexy?

_"Life's too short to make a mistake  
Let's think of each other and hesitate  
Young and impatient we may be  
There's no need to act foolishly  
If we part our hearts won't forget it  
Years from now we'll surely regret it"_

— **Chairmen of the Board**, "Give Me Just a Little More Time"

A Sister Trope to Celibate Hero, where a character declares that they've no intention of having sex just for the sake of sex. Either they're waiting for "The One", or they think they've found them, but the timing isn't right (and if it's Their First Time, they want it to be special).

A common thing in many religions, which declare that sex is sacred and must be saved for the wedding night. In fact, pre-marital sex used to be a taboo topic, but nowadays it seems to be a more common standard.

If the character who wants to wait is male, it's usually to show him as a romantic or old-fashioned (often both). If female, there's about the same chance it'll be because All Women Are Prudes.

A frequent variant is an engaged couple deciding not to have sex again until after the wedding to make their wedding night more "special".

Compare But I Would Really Enjoy It and Chastity Couple. Contrast Nature Abhors a Virgin, Everybody Has Lots of Sex.

Occasionally paired with Insatiable Newlyweds to show that the couple wasn't waiting out of prudishness.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Girl Friends (2006)_, due to both sides mistakenly assuming that their still virgin partner already had sex with somebody else, Mari and Akko have a very awkward first attempt that ends with this.
-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_:
    -   Ishigami rejects Tsubame's offer of Pity Sex because he'd rather not have sex at all than have it with someone who doesn't love him romantically.
    -   Shirogane tells Kaguya that she doesn't need to force herself to have sex with him after seeing her have reservations while they're engaging in foreplay and tells her that he's fine waiting until she actually feels comfortable... and then their good night kiss(es) ends up getting them both in the mood anyway.
-   In the manga version of _Koi Kaze_ (but not the anime adaptation), Koshiro and Nanoka make a point of not immediately having sex after finally entering a relationship, and several months pass before they get intimate that way.
-   _Why the Hell Are You Here, Teacher!?_: After getting together, the Omake chapters show that Kana and Izumi aren't ready to go all the way with their new boyfriends. Not that it doesn't stop the former from fantasizing about it. In the anime, Rin Suzuki says he won't get intimate with Mayu until they're married, to her disappointment.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   Timothy Drake, the third Robin. Prior to _Detective Comics(Rebirth)_ he was one of the few persons in the Bat-Family (and The DCU superhero community) who hasn't done it. The dude's had at least 5 girlfriends, and has been propositioned for sex _thrice._ It looks he and Stephanie Brown are finally ready to have sex at the end of _Convergence_, but they took such a beating that neither feels up to it. So they settle for simply falling asleep laying with one another.
-   Virgil Hawkins of _Static_ has actually refused to have sex with his then-girlfriend, after having a serious talk with his father about how it is a big step in responsibility for someone his age. Virgil ultimately decides he isn't ready for more than he already has with his life as a superhero and decides to wait.
-   In _New Warriors_: Firestar, Nova, and Namorita break Justice out of the convoy taking him to prison<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . After Vance convinces them to let him face the music, Nova, Namorita, and the guards look the other way while he and Firestar "have a private goodbye." Angelica wants to, but Vance convinces her that their first time should be more special than a quick rut in the woods.
-   _Scott Pilgrim_: Scott Pilgrim and Ramona Flowers do this in volume 1. After their first "date", Scott ends up at Ramona's apartment with the (literal) girl of his dreams half-naked, on top of him, in bed. However, Ramona abruptly changes her mind about having sex with him the moment he shows some kind of reluctance in the process of beginning to do the deed (Granted, she does tell him that she gets to change her mind later if she wants to, and they still sleep in the same bed). Scott, who unknown to both Ramona and the reader, is still shaken from how his relationship with Envy Adams ended, is completely fine with this; It should also be noted that when he's with a woman he really likes, he has a tendency (especially this early in his Character Development) to be pretty whipped. That said, Ramona doesn't change her mind untill _Scott_ both shows some initial hesitance about going all the way (contrasting being gung-ho until he lets his anxiety out the first try), and has been with her for a decent stretch of time.
-   In _Ultimate Spider-Man Annual #3_, Peter Parker and Mary Jane discuss whether they're ready to take their relationship to the next level. In the end MJ decides she's not after initially wanting to, and Peter (who has been understanding about it the whole time) tells her that while he wants to sleep with her, he's more than willing to wait until she's ready.

    Comic Strips 

-   In _9 Chickweed Lane_, Edda and Amos attempt the "abstinence until marriage" route.

    Fan Works 

-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ fanfic _Gankona, Unnachgiebig, Unità_: Germany, Italy, and Japan actually didn't do it until they got married after months of dating. Let's just say the Bad Touch Trio announced the end of the waiting period while performing surveillance on the honeymoon ship.
    
    "The Axis Virgin Trio is no more!"
    
-   _A Crown of Stars_: Discussed. Asuka and her best friend Hikari talk about Asuka's love life, who has just recently hooked up with Shinji after several years of Belligerent Sexual Tension, Unresolved Sexual Tension, misunderstandings, and a long forced separation. Shinji and Asuka started to have sex shortly after getting together, and Hikari -who has just hooked up with her high-school crush but has not had sex yet- is seeking advice about giving the next step or waiting a while, so she asks Asuka what she would have done when they were thirteen. Asuka replies that knowing what she knows now, she would not have waited.
-   _Advice and Trust_:
    -   Shinji and Asuka have a conversation shortly after hooking up, and he tells her that, even if the HAD enjoyed kissing and groping, they did not need to have sex right away because he also enjoyed talking with her, and he wants all of her, so he is okay with waiting.
    -   Ritsuko decided to wait on sleeping with Maya after hooking up, partially because she just came out of an emotionally abusive relationship with Gendo.
-   _The Child of Love_: Variant. Shinji and Asuka got a one-night stand. As a result of it, Asuka got pregnant and their relationship almost got destroyed. After reconciling, Asuka said they were not having sex until Teri’s birth at the very least and they had to be very careful from now on. Shinji agreed.
-   _Children of an Elder God_: In chapter 23 Asuka is feeling very strong urges to make love to Shinji. However she suspects the Outer Gods want them to give in their base instincts so they can wipe humankind out, and she restrains herself, telling herself they are still too young and with no idea of how to do it properly.
    
    _One day...one day she would she would make love to him. But not now. She was too young, and so was he, and she had a feeling that was what Nylarathotep wanted._  
    _Also, she wasn't sure how to do it properly._
    
-   _Ghosts of Evangelion_: Shinji and Asuka argue about their sex life several times: both are attracted to each other, but their many psychological issues -which include Asuka being mentally and physically raped several times in the past- keep in the way of a healthy sex life. Sometimes Asuka just wants to have sex so the matter is settled, but Shinji argues he's afraid of hurting her and they shouldn't force themselves. Even after they manage to get past this particular hurdle, their sex life can only be described as "sparce", with the deed occurring once every couple of months at most. As Asuka eloquently puts it, "We're fucked up. We have issues. It takes a lot to get us in the right spot mentally to do it, and we can't manage that on a regular basis." Misato has a hard time wrapping her head around this.
-   _Last Child of Krypton_: In chapter 9 of the redux Asuka tries to seduce Shinji, but Shinji convinces her to wait a while because she was severely hurt and distraught.

-   Common in TheNovelArtist's stories, but _Second Chances (TheNovelArtist)_ is notable in that Marinette is recovering from the tragic death of her husband just a year earlier.

Once they get to the wedding night, however...
-   _Tsumiko and the Enslaved Fox_: Argent and Tsumiko have been platonically sharing rooms and a bed for weeks when Argent experiences a Love Epiphany and attempts to seduce her. While initially receptive, Tsumiko puts a stop to things once she realizes how far he intends to go, due to her religious upbringing and moral convictions. Later, she's made aware that his words and actions were the Amaranthine equivalent of a proposal, and consummating the relationship would be considered as binding as a wedding to his culture. It's implied she might not have stopped him if she had realized.

-   Edward asks Bella for this in _Twilight_, for a mixture of reasons boiling down to "I'm probably damned anyway, but you should have the best chance with whatever god(s) may exist."

Turk is happy to oblige. In season 1, Carla mentions to Elliot that she usually waits a month to sleep with new boyfriends. As she puts it, she likes to make them wait until they think they are _never_ going to get in her pants, and then jump them like an animal (which usually takes about a month).

    To save some for later so our love can be greater

    Remember I said the same thing to you  
    You don't have to be frightened with my love  
    Because, I'll never give up on you  
    Let's wait awhile  
    Ah well before it's too late  
    You know you can't rush love_

Interestingly, the POV character who wants to wait is male.
-   Avril Lavigne's "Don't Tell Me".
-   Lady Antebellum's "Just a Kiss" goes, "So baby I'm alright, oh, let's do this right, with just a kiss goodnight."

    Love Child!_
    

    Mythology & Religion 

-   In the gospel of Matthew, even when Joseph takes Mary as his wife, the two of them hold off on consummating the marriage until Mary gives birth to her firstborn son, who turns out to be Jesus. Catholic interpretations, though, have Joseph keep Mary a virgin even after she gives birth to Jesus.

They did end up having sex later, but only after Jimmy saw that Lacey had become as dedicated to Jimmy as he was to her. Also, Jimmy let Lacey have sex with other men, so long as it supported his radical social movement, to prove sex wasn't the reason he had fallen for her.

    Theatre 

-   In _A Little Night Music_, the middle-aged widower Fredrik marries 18-year-old Anne, who even eleven months after the wedding, still isn't ready to have sex. This divide eventually drives Fredrik into the arms of his ex-lover and Anne into the arms of her 19-year-old stepson.

    Video Games 

-   _Baldur's Gate II: Shadow Of Amn_
    -   This is the "correct" choice when romancing Aerie, near the end of that storyline. If you accept her invitation and do the deed, in the morning after she will break up with you because she wasn't really as ready as she thought, and you took advantage of her emotions. If you tell her to wait, she'll later be happy you did the right thing. Besides, you have other opportunities in the expansion. In fact, by then you don't have the option to wait.
    -   Viconia's romance takes a different approach. You can bed her fairly early on (and she will break off the relationship if you don't accept), but later on, she considers it just a tedious duty ("Let's just get it over with"). You can respond by just having sex as usual... or offer to just cuddle since she's clearly not in the mood for anything else. Viconia is very surprised at this un-drow-like option but says afterwards that it wasn't bad.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, the romance option with Alistair plays out like this. You _can_ convince him to go to bed instead of waiting for him to feel ready and approach you, but the love scene doesn't play and he seems unhappy about it.
        -   The romance with Leliana has similar leanings, as she wants to wait until she's in love before agreeing to go to bed.
        -   The Player Character can invoke this in any romance if the companion approaches you for sex first. Surprisingly, _Zevran_ takes it best. If you shyly state that you're not ready and ask to wait a while he's actually charmed and welcomes you to let him know whenever you're ready. (True to his word, the only way to sleep with Zevran after that is for the Warden to approach him about it, as he doesn't pursue it again). By contrast, the other love interests honor your feelings but are clearly disappointed (and somewhat embarrassed) and lose some affection if you ask to wait when they approach you.
    -   _Dragon Age: Inquisition_: When a romanced Dorian approaches a male Inquisitor for sex, said Inquisitor can either agree to jump into bed or ask to wait a while. If the latter, Dorian is shocked into silence, but happy to wait since he secretly yearned for a loving monogamous relationship with a man he loved, but was conditioned to think such things were impossible in his home country, where homosexuality is regarded as such a shameful secret that casual trysts were all he ever knew.
-   Kate, the true love interest of _Grand Theft Auto IV_, no matter how many times Niko dates her, she will not sleep with him.
-   _Story of Seasons: Trio of Towns_: The game actually has two occurrences of this, surprisingly enough. But due to its rating, the game pulls off more child-friendly versions.
    -   Kasumi mentions in her penultimate love event that she isn't comfortable enough to kiss the farmer yet, but that holding hands is alright. Her final love event then has her try to kiss the farmer, but she stops herself and says that they'll wait until marriage.
    -   Yuzuki gives the farmer a kiss on the cheek in his final love event, saying that a kiss on the lips will have to wait for another day.
-   _Mass Effect_: If you romance Liara, she asks to wait because she wants it to be special. She then approaches you just before the final battle.
-   In _Mass Effect 2_, a romanced Garrus asks to wait until just before you start the Suicide Mission.
    
    **Garrus:** You know me. I always like to savor the last shot before popping the heat sink (Beat) Wait, that metaphor went somewhere horrible.
    
-   _SLAMMED!_: Non-sexual example; Ecstasy will ask you this the first time you pursue them, because they aren't ready for a relationship. Later, the PC can do the same to _them_ for the same reason.
-   Another Bioware example is in _Star Wars: The Old Republic_: during the Jedi Consular's romance path with Nadia, he turns her down the first time she propositions him for sex, telling her that she's acting out of fear, grief, and desperation, not love. Her pleading with him to acquiesce and eventual admittance that she does fear losing him at any moment just cements this as the right decision in his mind. And it is—Nadia later thanks him for it, apologizes for her behavior, and agrees to take things slowly, so they can truly appreciate what they have instead of rushing it.
-   Subverted in _Hades_ when Zagreus tries this line on Thanatos upon their Relationship Upgrade, hoping to prove that he isn't just acting on an impulsive whim, and assures Thanatos that he's happy to wait until Thanatos is ready... Only for Thanatos, who had _invited himself into Zagreus' bedroom_, to roll his eyes and tell Zagreus that he's ready _now_.
    
    **Thanatos:** You say you'll wait? Well, let me ask you this: What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for, I'm _here_, already. Right...?  
    **Zagreus:** Than!... Hahaha, oh, you're right! \[Cue Sexy Discretion Shot\]
    

    Visual Novels 

-   _Double Homework_:
    -   The protagonist has an unusual one of these with Johanna and Tamara. When the two girls decide to share him between themselves, Johanna and Tamara also leave him to choose which one he wants to go all the way with first. This is double subverted for the protagonist and Tamara, because Tamara, having made him wait for all the goods, tells him that she wants to bed him right away to beat Johanna to the same thing. However, it is all a setup, as Tamara has arranged for Johanna to walk in on the two of them when they’re about to have sex.
    -   Defied by Amy. Amy is disillusioned about a lot of things, romance being one of them. Therefore, she lets the protagonist go all the way with her at the first chance he gets and initiates trying a lot of things that she’s heard about.
    -   Discussed between the protagonist and Rachel. According to the protagonist, the fact that they’ve already gone through all this is the reason why it’s so easy to have sex with an ex.
-   _Melody_:
    -   Melody is shy about jumping into bed with the protagonist, not least because she is still a virgin.
    -   Becca also wants to wait for the right time before going all the way with the protagonist, because in her experience, sex has been the beginning of the end for a treasured friendship.
    -   The protagonist wants to hold off having sex with Amy because he doesn’t want to screw up things for Melody.
    -   The protagonist and Isabella provide an interesting aversion. When Bethany breaks up with the protagonist, he and Isabella admit that they’ve been crushing on each other since they were teenagers. However, instead of waiting for the “right” time, they agree to a one-night stand, after which they promise that they won’t act weirdly toward each other.

-   In _Penny and Aggie_, Marshall repeatedly says this to Karen, because "we're kids." (The real reason, as the comic later reveals, is that he thinks having sex too soon will make him like his hedonistic mother, whom he resents.)

After several months, Marshall decides he's ready and they consummate their relationship... but break up soon after for unrelated reasons.
