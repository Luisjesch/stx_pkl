Please don't list this on a work's page as a trope.  
Examples can go on the work's YMMV tab.

Might not be sold in the 'hood.

_You may have noticed that one of the Yo Gabba monsters is a flexible salami-like creature with one gaping eye at the top. I'm pretty sure I sketched the original design for that in the margin of a chemistry textbook back in 1985._

Let's face it, some characters look odd. Something about their design makes them look ugly, or freaky, or... phallic. Or worse yet, maybe they resemble Blackface or the Ku Klux Klan.

The design is obviously unintentional (or at least probably not intended by the majority of the creators), and not meant as a Parental Bonus or Getting Crap Past the Radar. The offending part is pretty obvious. And it is so distracting that it can _never be unseen_.

See also: Fashion-Victim Villain (when the villain has an unconventional taste in fashion), Nude-Colored Clothes (when a character has the appearance of being naked because they wear clothes the same color as their skin), Accidental Innuendo (when a statement not intended by the creators to be dirty is still interpreted as something lewd by the audience), and Unfortunate Names (a character's name sounds wrong unintentionally). Will often be Nausea Fuel.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The Antibodies in _Brain Powerd_ have cockpits in their crotches, covered by a long, narrow strip of armour that extends when the pilot wants to climb out.
-   Shiro from _Deadman Wonderland_ has a skin-tight bodysuit that's very close to the same shade as her skin, meaning that at first glance she looks totally naked apart from some body paint (which are actually patterns drawn on the suit) and it's even worse in the black-and-white manga since you can't make a comparison between the color of her face and the fabric and realize she _is_ wearing something.
-   _Digimon_: The _Data Squad_ version of Crowmon has a white mane that really stands out thanks to his mostly black and purple design. Said mane is braided into a single rope that dangles freely with a bell to each side of it.<small>◊</small> Guess we should call the _Data Squad_ version the four-legged crow. Also, the very un-wendigo-like Wendigomon from the first _02_ movie has been compared to a minstrel show for its facial features.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_: In a random segment in the Cell Saga, Imperfect Cell crosses paths with a sports team who harasses him before getting killed. One of the athletes' heads looks just like a penis, which _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_ made fun of by blurring it out.
-   _Gundam_:
    -   _∀ Gundam_: The titular Gundam's cockpit is placed on its crotch. This wouldn't be so bad, if said cockpit wasn't also a detachable aircraft with a translucent orb at its tip.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_: The MSJ-06II-ED Tieren Zhizhu, which was intended to guard the Orbital Elevator, besides some other weapons, has a 30 mm Machine Gun turret attached to its crotch, as you can see for yourself.
-   _Hello Kitty_: Hello Kitty's main pose is putting her finger to her... "mouth" as if pondering something. However, thanks to the lack of clear digits on her hands, it can easily look like she's flipping you off.<small>◊</small>
    -   It's not just Hello Kitty, other Sanrio Characters that are typically depicted with no fingers (such as My Melody and Cinnamoroll) are sometimes seen putting their fingers near their mouths when they are curious, confushed, or deep in thought. But also looks like their flipping you off as well.
-   _Hellsing_:
    -   One unit of Catholic Knights introduced in the last arc has uniforms accurately modeled after Spanish penitents (as seen in the picture above), which unfortunately is also how post-_The Birth of a Nation_ KKK members dress. _Hellsing Ultimate Abridged_ ran with this by making one of them an _actual_ Klansman.
    -   There's also Alucard's glasses that make him look like he has goofily crossed eyes<small>◊</small>. Once it's been seen it can never be unseen, which can ruin a _lot_ of scenes with the character, and it ends up being unintentionally so Narmy. Hi. These are my cactuses. I put googly eyes on them.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_: Guido Mista, of Part 5 fame, has a stylized arrow on his hat. Or, at least, what was originally intended to be an arrow. Many fans find his hat ornament to look more like a penis instead, to the extent that "dick hat" is a popular Fan Nickname for the said head accessory.
-   _TerraforMARS_: At least one reviewer has pointed out how the designs of the roaches that are the primary enemies of the series can be compared to racialized caricatures of black men.
-   _Welcome to the NHK_ has the logo on Satou's shirt looking nearly identical to the Russian curse word "хуй" (meaning roughly the same as English "dick", but considered far more obscene), which led to it becoming a meme on Russian imageboards and anime forums.
-   Zorc Necrophades from _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ has a dragon head on a long neck protruding from his crotch. It's _meant_ to be an evolution of Diabound's snake lower body, but add on legs and it becomes... er... Takahashi was in the midst of a Creator Breakdown and had been hospitalized due to an ulcer at the time, which certainly explains a lot; he did try to rework Zorc's look in a collected edition, but the damage is largely done. Naturally, LittleKuriboh has a field day with this.
    
    **Marik:** By the way, what is that thing on your crotch? You know, that dragon-head thing?  
    **Zorc:** Oh, that's my willy.  
    **Marik:** _Geez_, man, put some \[**EFF**\]ing pants on, will you?
    

    Arts 

-   A crucifix in the St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church in Warr Acres, Oklahoma, depicts Jesus with a distended stomach and abs — which some critics say looks a bit too much like an erect penis and scrotum.<small>◊</small> The clergy response was basically "whatever", and they refuse to discuss the controversy any further.
-   Nearly all reconstructions of _Tsintaosaurus_ depict it with a vaguely phallic-shaped unicorn-crest on the head, although some modern theories speculate it had nothing of the sort, and what people believed to be a horn-like crest was in reality only a fragment of a totally different-shaped head-ornament. But if that wasn't enough, some old illustrations (and an infamous toy) also gave it two, inflatable sacs at the base of said crest.
-   Red McCombs Superior Hyundai in San Antonio, TX has a statue of a Native American in the classic "how" pose,<small>◊</small> with his left hand resting at his side. Approaching it from a certain direction driving along Loop 410, though, makes his left thumb look like something else entirely.<small>◊</small>
-   Liverpool, UK, boasts a locally infamous statue of Queen Victoria which is holding an Orb and Sceptre. From the front and right side, the Sceptre looks like a Sceptre, but from the left side, the bottom of it looks like... something else.
-   A particular statue of William Penn at the Philadelphia City Hall is notorious for this among news photographers, since if you photograph it at a certain angle the placement of his right hand is pretty suggestive.<small>◊</small>
-   Among other figures of the past, the Château de Versailles has a statue of General Emmanuel Leclerc, Pauline Bonaparte's first husband. If the fact that he is the only naked figure in a gallery otherwise filled with fully-clothed statues is not weird enough, the sword resting on his right hip can easily look like another kind of sword from certain angles.
-   A sculpture called _Domestikator_ was moved from the Louvre in Paris to the "edgier" Pompidou Centre after some people thought that the human figure was penetrating the animal, which the artist claimed was not the intended meaning.
-   The statue atop the Burnside Fountain in Worcester, Massachusetts has become infamous for its, um, _suggestive_ posing. Officially called _Boy with a Turtle_ but known colloquially as _Turtle Boy_, the statue is of a naked boy riding on the back of a turtle — however, it looks a lot like the boy is “riding” the turtle in a different manner.

    Card Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:

    Comic Books 

    Comic Strips 

-   _The Far Side_:
    -   There is a comic of a sleeping dog dreaming of having caught a car and howling atop it, called "When dogs dream". Larson said later he drew in the car's transmission box where it was supposed to be, but when the editor cleared it to be published newspapers were inundated with mail from offended people thinking that the dog was supposed to be having sex with the car. The caption has been changed to "When car chasers dream" to rectify this.
    -   Gary Larson was flustered when a reader pointed out that an old woman he drew for the cover of _In Search of the Far Side_ looked like a giant phallus. His editor responded, "So?"
-   A common joke about Argentine comic character Gaturro is how his giant cheeks make his face look a butt or testicles.

    Eastern European Animation 

-   _Fairy Tale Sits on the Doorstep_: A lot of the monsters resemble KKK hoods, especially when one steals the pointed hat of the main character and puts it on. Given that the animation is from Soviet Latvia, it's pretty unlikely that they intended to promote American white supremacy.

    Fan Works 

-   A fan once recounted bringing fanart of Discord to a _Star Trek_ convention for John de Lancie to sign. Unfortunately, he didn't realize that a part of Discord's wing looked like something else until he was near the front of the autograph line. And then John De Lancie noticed right as he was about to sign it, was greatly amused by it, flagged down another _Star Trek_ actor and the con staff, telling them it was the only part of Discord they modeled on him and signed right on top of it.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Countryside Bears_ by _Dingo Pictures_ has a kangaroo with some sort of doll in its pouch that makes it look a _male_ kangaroo with a yellow and white groin, as seem in this video starting at around 4:32. With the company that made it, this sort of thing is to be expected.
-   _Foodfight!_
    -   In an early scene, when Dex Dogtective asks Daredevil Dan to be his best man, Dan starts... well, he's supposed to be crying tears of chocolate, since he's the mascot for a chocolate product, but just about everyone who's seen the movie will say it looks more like he's violently spewing feces from his face.
    -   Cheasel the Weasel's head and neck look _extremely_ phallic. That they're constantly bobbing and wiggling around does not help. The texture of his brown fur has caused some to call him "poop rat" or "shitweasel". This is due to the cheap budget the film was made with. The original trailer shows a less unfortunate looking model, however the film had to be re-built from the ground up after the original version was stolen.
-   _The Little Mermaid (1989)_ has a priest who appears to get a little TOO excited and sport an erection<small>◊</small> during Eric and "Vanessa's" wedding. A separate shot makes clear that the bulge is actually from his knobby knees, but Disney edited it out<small>◊</small> all the same because it _really_ looks like an erection.
-   _Rapsittie Street Kids: Believe in Santa_ shows one overhead shot of Ricky where his dreadlocks make him look like a literal pile of crap.
-   Turaga Nokama from _BIONICLE: Mask of Light_ has "decoration" on her chest that look like a pair of crudely drawn breasts. This could be an inappropriate joke put into a kids' film by the designers, except it's not hidden in the slightest. The other five Turaga's chest armor reflects the details of the masks they wear, but Nokama's mask is so plain that her chest detail had to be made up from scratch. Even if it _was_ meant to look like cleavage, the fact that they put it on an elderly robot-lady with a serious role inadvertently makes her come off as silly.
-   _Unstable Fables_ has several animals, such as the wolves and the bears, who have noses that extend past the rest of their faces, which make them look quite phallic.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The alien in _Alien Trespass_ is... well, phallic. The director, in an interview with _Fangoria_, stated that he pointed this out to the art designer, who answered "I was afraid you'd say that" and put tentacles at the top to try to counteract this. Its spaceship looks like the female counterpart, as well — and again, the art designer's response when called on it was "I was afraid you'd say that!"
-   _Dune (2021)_ depicts the Shai-Hulud as lacking the petal-like pedipalps they are usually depicted with, having round mouths ringed with baleen-like teeth instead. Director Denis Villeneuve claimed the change was intended to make the Shai-Huluds' mouths look like an 'eye of God'. Many fans were quick to point out that it also made them look like anuses _with teeth_.
-   The Dream Demons from _Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare_ resemble sperm.
-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_: The Great Goblin's throat resembles a scrotum.
-   _The Last Airbender_: Many reviewers commented "The princess has penis hair!" due to a particular shot from behind Yue<small>◊</small> that makes her hair look, well, phallic.
-   _The Nutcracker in 3D_: More than a few viewers have noted the resemblance of Tinker the Clown to John Wayne Gacy in his makeup.
-   While the costume design in _The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure_ is shoddy as-is, Toofie's is especially bad, as his eyes<small>◊</small> make him appear as a meth addict.
-   _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_: The Zaranites (an alien species who fortunately only appear as background extras) have a _serious_ case of penis-head syndrome.
-   Bill Corbett on the Romulan ship in the _Star Trek (2009)_ reboot: "Look, a giant space sphincter!"

    Live-Action TV 

-   The notorious Federation Security Robot in _Blake's 7_. Not only was it a very cheap-looking Tin-Can Robot, but its main weapon was mounted in a... very unfortunate place.
-   The _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ episode "Doublemeat Palace" had a demon with an incredibly phallic-looking tentacle that squirted venom at Buffy. And then Buffy's lesbian best friend chopped the tentacle off with an axe... According to the creators, the symbolism was completely accidental, although a dialogue joke was made about it in a later episode.
-   _Doctor Who_ has had more than a few unfortunately designed monsters:
    -   In "The Web Planet", there's a scene where a biological tentacle on a wall (called a "bio-gun" in the novelisation) squirts a sticky white web at the Doctor and Vicki before slowly going flaccid and shrinking.
    -   "The Krotons" features a Cliffhanger where a long, prehensile, biomechanical... thing with a slightly bifurcated head with a hole in the end shoots out of a hole in a wall and starts thrusting the Doctor to the floor. The Doctor gets around it in the next episode by having the end spray white fluid on a Mauve Shirt instead of on him.
    -   One of the most famous is probably the ambassador from Alpha Centauri<small>◊</small> in "The Curse of Peladon" and its Sequel Story "The Monster of Peladon". The cloak they're wearing is a last minute attempt to cover it up. The complaint simply changed from "It looks like a giant dick," to "It looks like a giant dick with a cloak on." There was even some speculation that they could be a _companion_ for a while, though the design soon put paid to that.
    -   In "Frontier in Space" the Ogrons are said to worship a hideous beast that fills them with terror. The designers created said beast, which unfortunately turned out looking unmistakably like a giant orange scrotum. The appalled director had to then rejigger the story so that the creature was shown only once and in very, very long shot.
    -   Davros' design in "Genesis of the Daleks" is great, so long as you aren't seeing him from the back, where the back of his chair is shaped like a hand flipping you off<small>◊</small>.
    -   The Organic Technology ship controls in "Terror of the Zygons" are very slimy, veiny and turgid. Tom Baker is clearly having a great time handling them as suggestively as he can in the scene which requires him to use them. This may be a theme with his take on the Doctor. (Later lampshaded in "The Zygon Invasion" in the Twelfth Doctor era, where the Doctor insists Zygon controls only work if you "titillate" them.)
    -   The infamous Creature from the Pit, with its many... protuberances. There was even a scene where, while trying to communicate with it, the Doctor picks up a longish, fleshy... thing from the Creature's midsection, looks it up and down, massages it slightly and then puts the end of it in his mouth, sucking and blowing on it. It is probably Accidental Innuendo. The costume designer and Tom Baker laughed about it in an interview with _Doctor Who Magazine_ — apparently it had originally been even _worse_ and the costume department had made heavy last-minute alterations to it to improve it, but were ultimately powerless to how badly the design had been botched up.
    -   The Vervoids in "Terror of the Vervoids", which look like either a) _uncircumsized_ dicks or b) vaginas with prominent clitorises. A newsagent once refused to stock an issue of _Doctor Who Magazine_ with an image of one on the cover on the grounds that it contained a "graphic sexual image".
-   An in-universe example occurs in _How I Met Your Mother_, where a Running Gag in season 2 is that Ted's boss is completely unaware that the skyscraper design he wants to present to their clients happens to be incredibly phallic, complete with a semicircular roof and two spherical entrance halls at the base, which are surrounded by wild foliage.
-   _Kamen Rider_:
    -   _Kamen Rider Gaim_: The title character's Super Mode is primarily white with a pointed helmet. It's modeled after samurai warlord armor, but Westerners are more likely to associate its shape and color with the KKK.
    -   Two in _Kamen Rider Revice_:
        -   Giff is presented as the Greater-Scope Villain and Sealed Evil in a Can that the rest of the villains are trying to revive. Until they do, he's represented as a statue that's big, pink, and looks like a giant vagina.
        -   The main heroes, Kamen Riders Revi and Vice, can work in conjunction Two Men, One Dress style to act as animals; which can put them in pretty awkward positions. The worst is the _T. rex_ combination, where Vice holds Revi by his legs and ends up planting his face in Revi's butt. Vice even complains to the audience about this the first time they do it.
-   An episode of _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ featured a scene where a man comes into an apartment to sign a man's severed leg. The reveal of the leg was from the knee down, making it look like a giant bell-end. Executive Meddling was mentioned in one of their documentaries.
-   In _Ressha Sentai ToQger_, ToQ-Oh is built in a way that the Red Ressha can unfold and extend a large red cylinder from the mecha's crotch. Which would be bad enough if it were just something people could do with their toys at home, but it was actually used once in the show.
-   The Blessing from _Torchwood: Miracle Day_ is revealed to be a fissure underground which some have remarked looks like a vagina.
-   _Ultra Series_: The franchise has its share of monsters and aliens, and inevitably some of them ends up with rather... awkward designs.
-   _Yo Gabba Gabba!_: Muno is a one-eyed monster who... looks like a giant red dildo. Charlie Brooker said he looks like "a Dalek's cock".

    Mythology & Religion 

-   Capirotes, hoods which are worn by penitents during Holy Week processions in Spain, are pointy, occasionally white, and completely cover the face apart from eye holes. They have nothing to do with the Ku Klux Klan and in fact predate it by hundreds of years. This has led to a rather unfortunate recurring example of this trope in Anime & Manga; the Klan obviously isn't a thing in Japan, so the capirote has not been stained by association with them like in the US, but it _has_ become commonly used as cliche bad guy attire thanks to the Rule of Cool, leading to all sorts of potential awkwardness during localization. For instance, Neo-Atlantis from _Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water_, who all dress up in a manner reminiscent of Klan-members despite having absolutely nothing in common with the Real Life organization.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _BattleTech_ has had its share of unfortunate-looking mechs over the years. One of the original machines to have issues is the Stalker<small>◊</small>, whose design has been compared to a sex-toy with legs pretty much since it was introduced. Another one is the Arctic Fox<small>◊</small>, which has an unfortunate resemblence to a heavily-armed toilet. The Dragonfire is a particularly egregious example, having a large cannon protruding from, for lack of a better word, its _crotch._
-   _Heroes Unlimited: The Justice Machine_ features a couple of characters drawn in such a way as to look like they have unclothed female crotches on otherwise masculine bodies.
-   In early _Rifts_ supplements, artist Kevin Long illustrates a vast number of Humongous Mecha with guns in their lower torsos as alleged anti-infantry position, which end up looking, well, phallic.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_ has had a few design misfires in the past as well. The most notable one in recent memory is the design of the Dreadknight, which has its pilot mounted on the chest wearing a harness. Fans have derided the design as looking more like a baby carrier...or a certain dodgeball robot.

    Theatre 

-   Cirque du Soleil's _Luzia_ has a few characters who are cacti. One of them has a long, straight arm jutting out from his crotch.

    Toys 

-   _Battle Beasts_: A really surprising number of the 1980s figures had their cybernetic armor sporting crotch fins, guns, sliding panels, or just highly suspicious protrusions.
-   _BIONICLE_:
    -   The rhino-like Vako from the _Master Builder_ set used a bent "pipe" piece for a tail that connected at the bend in its middle, so half of it stuck backwards like a tail, and the other half hung between the legs due to there being no friction to hold the piece in place. Worse, both ends were outfitted with an extension, not just the tail part that was _meant_ to be seen.
    -   Stronius<small>◊</small> from the Glatorian Legends series has an extra long protrusion on the bottom of his torso armor with a widened tip, which looks okay from the side but hugely questionable from the front as it hangs way below his belt line. For what it's worth, his packaging art tried to hide it.
-   _Jurassic Park_ has a Utahraptor in one of the early toylines that has leg kick action. Unfortunately, the button to activate the legs is placed beneath its tail, right behind its pubic bone, and it's been the, er, butt, of a few jokes.
-   _Monster High_: Catty Noir<small>◊</small> was meant to resemble a black cat, but her bright pink lips against black skin has been criticized for looking more like a blackface caricature.
-   _My Little Pony_:
-   There's a _Punisher_ toy that was infamously recalled because the first part of its transformation into a pistol results in the gun barrel coming out of its crotch.
-   Torch/Fire from _Slizer_ has his head between his legs, while Granite/Rock's action feature requires you to repeatedly push a giant rod into a hole on his butt.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_: The first action figures were set to give the Turtles tails, which their Mirage counterparts did have. While tails did work on the characters in the two-dimensional drawings, in the 3-D mock-ups, they ended up looking rather... phallic. So the tails were removed, and the Turtles have never depicted as having tails since.
-   _Transformers_:
    -   It's quite common for a Transformer to have some sort of unintentionally amusing crotch design. A _particularly_ unfortunate example is Scattershot.<small>◊</small> That silver-bordered black shape? That's a heat-sensitive sticker that you're supposed to activate by _rubbing._ And if that weren't bad enough, he can easily be mistransformed so that the nose and cockpit of his spaceship mode is protruding forward from there instead.
    -   The original toy of Megatron<small>◊</small> is infamous for having a trigger on his crotch.
    -   A good number of Mini-Cons have unfortunately-placed Powerlinx connectors.
    -   The _Transformers: Armada_ Hot Shot is a particularly infamous case of gimmick-induced silliness, as his Mini-Con gimmick involves plugging his Mini-Con into, well... his butt. This also results in a massive cannon swinging out of his body (his shoulders, admittedly, but that's still not great), which fires a red missile.
    -   _Transformers_ toy designers don't seem to be all too familiar with dinosaur anatomy, as at least two such figures have gimmicks located in unpractical places. The _Beast Wars_ Dinobot mold (and its repaints and remolds) has a rod sticking out of its cloaca that you have to push in to activate a feature, while _Transformers: Cybertron_ Beast Megatron has a Cyber Key slot in the same place. (Apparently it's because tails frequently end up as arms or arm-wielded weapons in robot mode. Apparently, Hasbro didn't think fans would realize this means in beast mode you're shoving things **directly** where the sun don't shine. Which means, apparently, Hasbro doesn't know kids very well.)
    -   The figure of _Beast Machines_ Obsidian has a tiny machine gun dangling under his cockpit. Since the cockpit is his chest in robot mode, this means that the gun ends up hanging down from between his legs... Thankfully, the toy's more cartoon-accurate configuration, in which his legs are "fused" together, makes this far less obvious.
    -   A good number of planes, such as G2 Smokescreen, have a design where the front part of the plane becomes the upper body, leading to a plane canopy in their chest and the nosecone on their crotch, but it's not especially noticeable. _Beast Machines_ Ultra Jetstorm, meanwhile, has a long, flexible cockpit with a bulbous head, designed to "look around" in vehicle mode. In robot mode, it's tucked between his legs, but still has working joints and can hang low or point forward with relative ease. Yep, it's the first Transformer to have an articulated wang.
    -   TJ Omega released a video called "Top 5 Inappropriate Transformers" on this subject, featuring a variety of questionable designs, misbehaving gimmicks and oddly placed kibble.
    -   _Beast Machines_ Silverbolt, a figure widely regarded as one of the least successful _Transformers_ figures ever, turns into (what is said to be) a condor, but the robot head isn't hidden in the least, and remains visible between the legs. The head also has a tall, thin, tubular shape, and can easily swivel forward, making it look like the condor has a grinning erection. Even if you transform it according to the instructions, it's clearly a head coming out of a condor's butt. This could easily have been avoided, as the toy has a big torso-piece which the small head could have retracted into. In robot mode, the condor's head ends up on his belly, staring at his own crotch — not much better.
    -   _Beast Wars_ Blackarachnia was made into a more feminine figure compared to her toy being a Palette Swap of Tarantulas. She later got a Transmetal II figure that was designed to translate more easily into the show, but the logistics of making a feminine figure had designers concerned about her looking naked, but ended up making her look like she is wearing a bikini. Furthermore, due to last-minute changes her Breast Plate was a last minute add on and able to be easily removed... with the attachment plugs on her chest in unfortunate places.
        -   _Beast Machines_ Blackarachnia has enormous, unmovable middle fingers, which make her looks like she's constantly flipping others off. Ironically, this probably would have fit perfectly for her _Beast Wars_ incarnation.
    -   It has been noted by some that _Transformers: Prime_ Megatron's crotch looks like the face of the twins Skyquake and Dreadwing, two of his most loyal servants.
    -   _Combiner Wars_ Silverbolt's two heads wind up in dubious places. Superion's head has his ears poking out of Silverbolt's chest, forming little rubber nipples: only mildly unfortunate. Where Silverbolt's head winds up in Superion mode: much more unfortunate.
    -   _Transformers: Cybertron_'s Backstop was originally designed to feature a genuine left hand, but on the toy's final release, the appendage is formed out of his rhinoceros mode's rear end, and as many fans have noted, it's sorta shaped like a poop scoop. Since the rhino's tail forms his middle finger, he's also one of the few Transformers who can flip the bird.
    -   The _Classics_/_Henkei_ Sideswipe and Sunstreaker figures have a pair of oddly placed circular details right on the bottom of their crotch that look fine from most angles other than the front.
    -   Fortress Maximus, who turns into a base, has an elevator gimmick controlled by a tiny red circular crank. Unsurprisingly for this page, when in his robot mode, the crank ends up on his crotch.<small>◊</small> Bonus points: since the peg has a shallow handle, it makes him look like he has a Teeny Weenie. (You can even keep turning it while he's in robot mode!)
    -   The 2021 _Kingdom_ Rattrap toy's design is a little too realistic. To make room for the robot arms, the rat form's rear end was expanded, resembling the enlarged testicular area that actual rats have. This in itself wouldn't be too strange, but the figure's round robot fists are fully visible, looking either as giant wrinkly buttocks or a pair of balls. Adding to the awkward design, the fists are colored a vaguely flesh-toned light brown, and in one episode of the original cartoon an angry Rattrap does tell one of his comrades to kiss his "pink, hairless..."
    -   A lot of bootleg transforming dinosaur toys have their dino-heads ending up in questionable places in robot mode, hence _Transformers_ fans dubbing them "Dinocock Prime".

    Video Games 

-   Von Bolt from _Advance Wars: Dual Strike_, for the most part, has a pretty good design for a Dark Lord on Life Support, but what ruins it are the hoses in his mouth that look like he's sticking out a big doofy tongue: along with his beady eyes, it makes him basically look like a pickled Lickitung..
-   The dragons in _Adventure_ look less like dragons and more like freakin' ducks.
-   The Atari Jaguar's CD add-on looks like a black toilet lid. Take a squint. The _Angry Video Game Nerd_, wastes no time noticing and sums it up:
    
    That's some cool looking design. It looks just like a toilet. Yeah, it's a fucking toilet. What a perfect analogy!
    
-   _Bahamut Lagoon_:
    -   Yoyo's battle sprite makes it seem like she has a giant chin, due to her clothes' neckline making her neck look like it's part of her face. (Thankfully, gets a better sprite halfway through the game.)
    -   Diana wears a giant ribbon on her waist, but it looks more like a tail.
    -   Mist's map sprite is only one pixel long if she walks left or right, making it look like a plant stem.
-   Most golems in _Baldur's Gate_ wear loincloths that look just a little too much like giant flapping dongs.
-   The _BEMANI_ game _Otoiroha_ has a cabinet that is infamous for resembling a toilet.
-   _Clockwork Knight_: As Vinny from Vinesauce states, it's difficult to not see Pepper as a skinny Wario.
-   The player character in the NES game _Code Name: Viper_ has the same three-color palette limitations as most sprites did in the era. Brown was used for his hair and outline and green for his jacket and boots, while a pinkish flesh tone was used for his skin... and _his pants_, which has the very unfortunate effect of making him look like he's undertaking his mission with no pants at all.
-   The _Cooking Mama_ spinoff _Babysitting Mama_ comes with a doll that you have to stick the Wiimote into in order to play the game, which also requires use of the nunchuck attachment. Unfortunately, the hole where you stick the Wiimote is located right below the back of the doll's head, so with the nunchuck cable sticking out, it looks like your baby's hanging itself — _especially_ if the wrist strap ends up around the baby's neck, as one YouTuber discovered.
-   _Crash Bandicoot_:
    -   Many of _Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex_'s character models look infamously ugly compared to the PS1 titles, but Cortex really takes the cake because his character model's slanted, unmoving eyes combined with his skin tone and goatee make him a dead ringer for an old-fashioned Yellow Peril villain. Interestingly, Cortex's yellowish skin tone was retained in later installments despite his character model improving.
    -   In _Crash Bash_, Rilla Roo's facial expression was permanently locked into an ":o" expression, which, due to the limitations of the PS1, made his mouth look like a butthole, adding to the fandom's dislike for the character at the time. Ironically, Rilla Roo's ridiculous design ended up being Rescued from the Scrappy Heap over time as he gained an ironic following, to the point that complaints over his divisive redesign in _Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled_ led to the addition of an updated version of his original _Crash Bash_ design as a separate playable character named "Fixed Rilla Roo", complete with the perpetual ":o" expression that made his original design so laughable.
-   _Day Dreamin' Davey_ on the Nintendo Entertainment System has the outlaws fought in the Wild West levels who have rather unfortunately-drawn noses. The way their noses are drawn could easily be mistaken for penises.
-   _Drakengard_'s wyrms have tails that resemble giant penises, not helped by the fact that the tail tends to dangle between their legs.
-   Pokey/Porky Minch's sprite in _EarthBound_ made him look like a cyclops due to his real eyes being obscured by his hair.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   The popular recurring Cactuar enemy stands in a particular pose supposedly inspired after a Japanese EXIT sign, but some Western players think it looks more like a swastika.
    -   Zeromus's second form from _Final Fantasy IV_ appears to have a massive, ribbed equine penis continually jizzing blood out of the end. This particular appendage was removed in the DS version.
    -   In _Final Fantasy VI_:
        -   Due to sprite limitations, the Finger Wag emote can be interpreted as a character Flipping the Bird.
        -   Emperor Gestahl, an old man with long white hair and a white mustache-and-beard combo, looks like a dog-headed bipedal creature. This is referenced in _Final Fantasy XIV_ with a Shi Tzu puppy familiar named Gestahl.
        -   Kefka Palazzo's final form is clothed in nothing but a waistwrap. Unfortunately, one of the folds ended up in the wrong place, which makes Kefka seem like he's a little too happy to see you. This was promptly acknowledged by many, many people. This may have been subtly referenced in _Dissidia Final Fantasy_, after using his Ex-Burst, Kefka goes "That was titillating", implying he is actually getting off on the destruction.
    -   In _Final Fantasy Tactics_ Ramza's sprite changes from chapter to chapter. His last costume contains pants that, due to the sprite artwork, look like they are totally skintight and riding quite far up his butt crack. The fact that the said outfit has noticeably less armor in the back doesn't help matters either. Fans of the series have affectionately dubbed the disturbing garments the Buttpants<small>◊</small>.
    -   _Final Fantasy IX_:
        -   Garnet's trance form in _Final Fantasy IX_ has some design elements that bear an unfortunate resemblance to a bare bottom. Made all the worse by how lovingly well-rendered her (tightly) clothed bottom is even out of trance.
        -   Likewise, it wasn't such a good idea to give Eiko pants that are almost the same color as her skin, since it makes her look like she's nude from the waist down. Add to that the fact that she's _six years old_ and looks very, _very_ young and most fans react with Squick. Most other art and her in game sprites make her pants a much darker red to avoid this.
        -   The Stroper enemy looks very phallic.
        -   Zidane Tribal, at least in _Dissidia Final Fantasy_. The point at which his tail sticks out of his pants should really have been placed just slightly higher up in order to look like it was actually coming from the base of his spine; as it is, it looks far too much like he's pooping it out.
    -   _Final Fantasy X_:
        -   The diving suit briefly worn by Rikku has beige-colored segments in front of her crotch and on her ass, making it look like she's wearing a lot less than she actually is.
        -   The _Final Fantasy X_ HD Remaster retextured the main characters in a more cartoony style that some players found fell straight into the Unintentional Uncanny Valley. A particularly common comment is that the characters, with plasticy skin and exaggerated lips, now resembled deluxe sex dolls.
    -   With _Final Fantasy XII_'s character design being extremely realistic, Vaan's drawn-on chest... shadow... things seem very much out of place. Depending on who you ask, they either look like really odd sunburns, or signs of emaciation. Luckily, the _Zodiac Age_ remaster fixes this.
    -   _Dissidia Final Fantasy (2015)_ textures Exdeath's loincloth sash to have a weirdly regular pattern that makes it look like a pack of sushi rolls.
    -   The animation used for Cactuars in _Final Fantasy XV_ gives them what appear to be really tight, cute butts.
-   _Fire Emblem Gaiden_ has the infamous "Dong Armor"—most visibly on the cover of the game<small>◊</small>, Alm's suit of armor has a massive segmented crotchpiece that dangles between his legs. It was removed completely for his redesign in the remake, unsurprisingly, though it returned for one of his alternate designs in _Fire Emblem Heroes_, to much rejoicing.
-   _Halo_: As stated in the reference book _The Art of Halo_, Bungie's co-founder wanted the Elites to have tails until an employee pointed out to him that, alongside the non-sexual factor of the sliding scale of ferality vs. intelligence conveyed by character design (of which the Elites are on the latter end), the tail would look phallic when an Elite is sitting.
-   _Home Alone 2: Lost in New York_: In the Game Boy version, the ending screen has Kevin McCallister raising his fist in victory over the Sticky Bandits. Due to the hand being undetailed, it could easily be mistaken for either him missing his hand or Flipping the Bird.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_:
-   _Kirby_:
    -   _Kirby Star Allies_: The game's Big Bad, Lord Hyness, is an Ax-Crazy priest whose face is hidden behind a long, white, hooded robe. While his design is meant to resemble a stylized monk's habit, American players have noted a strong resemblance to the Klansmen. It gets more awkward when he is redeemed at the end of the postgame campaign, _Heroes in Another Dimension_, and still keeps the hood on.
    -   _Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe_: One of the new bosses introduced in this remake is Hydriath, an elemental Underground Monkey of Goriath who has a tendril of water spouting out of his head in place of Goriath's hair. The unfortunate part of this design happens when Hydriath Turns Red and "goes Super Saiyan", which turns that water a suspiciously urinary shade of yellow.
-   _Kuro No Ken Sword Of Darkness_ has some serious design flaws thanks to its static animation and graphic limitations. For instance, your hero has a special move where he sheathes and unsheathes his sword rapidly, causing repetitive damage to his opponents, but with his hand movements and his sword being sheathed at around groin level, it looks more like he's masturbating. (In the middle of a fantasy battle, no less!)
-   The Orc Chasm in _Kingdom of Loathing_ is shaped quite a bit like a vagina, though given the name this was probably intentional. The valley beyond it was originally represented by two mountains a short distance apart from each other with a row of trees at the bottom, looking uncannily similar to two knees and pubic hair. This was allegedly accidental on the artist's part, and it was eventually edited to use the same graphic as its predecessor. The level 9 quest was revamped again in August 2012, and the Valley of Rof'lm'fao was split off into a separate zone that used the original graphic.
-   In _King's Quest III_, because of the limitations of the graphics, the protagonist's sprite has, for eyes, a solid line of red pixels, making him look like Cyclops.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   Ganon's sprite design<small>◊</small> in _The Legend of Zelda_ has confused a lot of people with some of his poses. Is he pretending to be a catgirl when Link walks in?
    -   This same game attempted to give Link irises and pupils. Actually, since each eye is two pixels high, he just looks like he has four eyes, which is talked about here.
    -   _Zelda II: The Adventure of Link_:
        -   The Wizzrobe's design<small>◊</small> is quite reminiscent of KKK robes, right down to the colour.
        -   Link's death sprite is rather... suggestive, due to the fact that his "recoil from damage" sprite has him holding his very short sword at waist-height and perpendicular to his body, and the death sprite turns it into a silhouette.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_'s Ooccoo<small>◊</small> is infamous for looking like it has four pairs of exposed saggy breasts because of some extremely badly placed markings combined with suggestive feather shapes.
    -   Bucha<small>◊</small> the Kikwi elder from _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_ is shaped like a scrotum. Really, the Kikwis as a whole look like scrotums, but Bucha most of all.
    -   As for the bosses in _Skyward Sword_, The Imprisoned<small>◊</small> looks like a giant black pinecone with stubby legs and an anus on top, and Tentalus<small>◊</small> looks like the chubby child of Mike Wazowski and Celia.
    -   The Moblins in _Skyward Sword_ blatantly look like their anuses are exposed because of the way their scant, thin loincloth is designed, which is made worse by how the player is encouraged to stab them in the ass a lot when fighting them because they block their front with wooden shields, and there is a big height difference.
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   The Yellow Devil MK-II in _Mega Man 3_ is supposed to have manly pectorals, but to some it looks like it has a pair of boobs.
    -   Zero of the _Mega Man X_ series is notorious for having a pair of Power Crystals in an unfortunate placement. It's made even better in _Mega Man X4_ when he yells what sounds like "titties!" when he uses the Shippuuga/Hurricane Fang move.
    -   Oil Man in _Mega Man Powered Up_ is an Uncle Tomfoolery who resembled a blackface caricature in the Japanese release. International releases changed his black parts to blue and made his lips yellow, but it still didn't help that the character still acts like a stereotype. The Archie comic's depiction of Oil Man is blue with a red scarf covering his mouth at all times.
    -   In _Mega Man 11_, Impact Man has the ability to transform into a three-pronged piece of mining equipment with a disturbing resemblance to a fidget spinner.
    -   Rospark from _Mega Man ZX Advent_ has a giant metal horn protruding from a very unfortunate place when he's in his unfolded form<small>◊</small>. The fact that he's an extremely flamboyant villain with lots of creepy dialogue for Grey doesn't help matters, either.
    -   The miniboss in Tunnel Rhino's stage, Hell Crusher, has a giant drill placed in a rather unfortunate area.
-   This<small>◊</small> _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_ promotional statue. Snake's outfit is not unfortunate unless you're allergic to shameless female-aimed fanservice, but the placement of that lamp seems to be trying a bit too hard.
-   One of the bosses from _Nier_, a giant crocodile-like Shade named Hook looks like it has multiple pairs of either breasts or testicles hanging from its neck.
-   _NieR: Automata_ has the incredibly phallic-looking aliens<small>◊</small>, as well as the giant orb bosses, most of whom (with the sole exception of Hegel) have a hole on their backside that occasionally lets out a linked-sphere type machine, bringing to mind anal parasites such as tapeworms.
-   _Resident Evil 6_: A lot of people had fun pointing out that the logo looks like a man bending forward to suck off a bipedal giraffe.
-   In _Shadow of the Colossus_, Pelagia, the twelfth Colossus, is defeated by stabbing a weak spot on its belly, but a lot of players saw it as Wander defeating Pelagia by stabbing its crotch because of the rather low placing of the weak spot.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_:
    -   The Carnival Night Zone miniboss, along with the bosses of Marble Garden and Flying Battery Zones in _Sonic 3 & Knuckles_ suffer from rather phallic designs. It doesn't help the flames it shoots are also suggestive in shape.
    -   Silver the Hedgehog, whose debut in _Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)_ meant the addition of a third new main hedgehog to the series. Except one of the very first things just about everyone noted about his design is that his head quills look like a marijuana leaf<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . This (combined with the fact he has a friend named Blaze) led to a lot of stoner jokes. One of the most notable was BrainScratch Commentaries coining the Fan Nickname "Pothead the Porcupine".
-   _StarCraft_: Artwork for the Goliath mech often features an anti-infantry gun that looks… erm.
-   There's absolutely nothing weird about Claude C Kenny's character design in _Star Ocean: The Second Story_ when viewing his artwork, and it's pretty easy to tell he's wearing a beige jacket in the original game's sprites. However, the 2023 remake introduced a lighting system that alters the shading on sprites depending on the location. …And in areas with bright light the coloration of his jacket on his sprite is so close to his skin color that if you're playing on a small screen, his sprite sort of looks like he's wearing a virgin killer sweater with white tights and white bandages on his arms, especially from the back.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
-   _Tales of Berseria_ has Kamoana. She's a preteen girl that was turned into a Therion, with her Therion-form having her wear what looks like black, swirly bodypaint.
-   Barricade from _Transformers Universe_, according to TFWiki, has a crotch shaped like Bonecrusher's face.
-   In _Undertale_ when you first encounter Mettaton's second form and he appears from the smoke, thanks to the way the game's engine handles transparenciesm that area at his crotch looks way too much like a penis<small>◊</small>. Making things worse is the game has repeatedly played up how Alphys finds this form sexy and that it's an intentional in-universe case of fanservice.
-   In _Xenoblade Chronicles 2_, Dagas wears an outfit similar to Napoleonic royalty, including white pants. This would be fine if his skin wasn't just as snow-white as those pants, which to some can make it look like a cut-out showing off his crotch.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:

    Webcomics 

-   Invoked in this _Penny Arcade_ comic, based on a real conversation between the artist and writer. The image is no longer on the site, but Tycho showed a vertical banner meant to be hung in one of their convention halls. Gabe was positioned below Tycho, giving a thumbs up, but his hand happened to be placed exactly on top of his crotch, making it look like Gabe was giving Tycho an eager handjob.
-   _Arthur, King of Time and Space_ sometimes used the "triangle" art style of Gadzikowski's _The Hero of Three Faces_. Lancelot in the superhero arc was a Batman-like character called the White Night, who wore a white cowl. The one appearance of White Night in triangle format was a No Fourth Wall strip concluding they should never do it again.

    Western Animation 

-   _Balloon Land_: The Pin Cushion Man is shaped to look like a safety pin, which his head and mouth being the clasp. However, when the pin point is unclasped, it looks like an erect penis sticking out of his cushion. This, combined with his predatory behavior, has earned him a reputation as a Memetic Molester.
-   When _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_ did its version of _Emperor Joker_, it gave the Joker a crown in the shape of a whoopie-cushion. However, there are a few people who say his crown looks more like a giant pink condom.
-   Recurring _Beetlejuice_ villain Scuzzo the Clown has a black face with a long nose in reference to the mask worn by the Pulcinella comedy character, but combined with his red lips it is easy to misinterpret as a blackface caricature.
-   The titular character of _Bing_ is an anthropomorphic rabbit who looks somewhat like a Blackface caricature with a cleft lip.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   An in-universe example where Peter designs a toy called "Mr. Zucchini Head."<small>◊</small> That "dances" (read: _vibrates_).
    -   There's at least two instances where they lampshade that Peter's chin looks like a pair of testicles: once when the FCC is censoring Real Life and they debate whether Peter's face needs to be censored because of it, and again in a much earlier episode in season 3 when Peter is stroking his chin in thought before it comes off in his hand. He exclaims "Agh! How did these get up here?", then sticks his "chin" into the front of his pants.
-   _Kim Possible:_ The titular character's upper lip looks like a mustache to some people because of the way it's stylized. Other female characters have this same problem as well. Once you see it you can't unsee it.
-   This may or may not have been intentional, but the head cat of Birds Anonymous from the _Looney Tunes_ short of the same name appears to be high due to his half-closed eyes and dazed expression.
-   _Rolie Polie Olie_: Gloomius Maximus has a faint, reddish dripping stain on his chin. It might be rust, or maybe the red paint on his lips leaking. But (hopefully) unintentionally, it looks almost like a blood stain.
-   _Smiling Friends_ has an in-universe example with the forest demon. He is a black humanoid with a large mouth and branches on his head that act as hair. When the demon accidentally invades a Halloween party, the guests think that he’s a human dressed up as Blackface. After he unsuccessfully tries to tell the them the truth and that he just naturally looks like that, they proceed to beat him to death, devour his insides, and light the corpse on fire.
-   In _SpongeBob SquarePants_, there is a background anchovy with a protruding belly button. Due to a combination of the way that his belly button is drawn and the position on his stomach, many fans misinterpreted it as a penis.
-   It's not uncommon for _Steven Universe: Future_ fans to point out how Monster Steven looks like he has a penis for a head, thanks in no small part to his thick long neck and the small, rounded shape of his head. The fact that his skin is entirely pink does not help.

-   The OrganWise Guys is a company dedicated to promoting good health among children. Fair enough. They also use various mascots to represents different types of health. Still fair enough. They have an anthropomorphic Stock Femur Bone called "Calci M. Bone" to promote good bone and dental health. Still fair enough. Then they made a poster depicting her wearing a hat. Suddenly the bone looks like a different part of the body. And to make things even better, her name has a "®" symbol after it, meaning that the poster literally says "Calci M. Bone®".
-   The National Hockey League's Columbus Blue Jackets introduced a second mascot, Boomer, to go along with their cannon-themed third jersey in 2010. Boomer, whose costume was an inflatable cannon suit with "wheels" at the legs, was derided for being too phallic, and was quietly phased out.
-   Early Euro coins showed a map of the EU countries. On the 1 and 2 Euro coins, Scandinavia minus Norway ended up looking like flaccid male genitalia. They changed it to a complete European map after a few years.
-   During D23 Expo 2022, Disney would unveil a special Mickey Mouse ear hat and Minnie Mouse ear headband intended to celebrate the company's 100th anniversary. However, the design they went with is um… questionable to say the least. The idea was that they've been splashed with platinum paint. However, many have noted it looks like they've been splashed by a certain white bodily fluid instead. The fact that the item description on the shopDisney site says Mickey and Minnie are "dripping with excitement" only makes it worse. Likely in response to this, Disney would quietly change the item description to rid the "dripping with excitement" part a few days after the intial listing, before they ultimately decided to delist both hats from the store shortly after.
