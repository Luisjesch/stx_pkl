_"I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That was why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now."_

Egad! Your best friend, loyal comrade, or long standing love interest has been taken over by The Virus, Brainwashed, mind controlled, possessed or subjected to Red Kryptonite, Green Rocks, some sort of MacGuffin or mind-bending Applied Phlebotinum or turned to the dark side willingly! This often follows The Reveal that the mysterious foe whose paths have crossed your own time and again is actually a former close friend...or that certain relative who unaccountably disappeared many years ago.

You're the hero and your friend is now evil—a fight has to happen. But the obviously weaker opponent is winning! The hero can't bring himself to fight at full power against someone they love—they know that the loved one is still there somewhere. The hero will win this fight by talking the friend out of the evil influence, usually because of The Power of Friendship or The Power of Love.

Often accompanied by the phrase "I know you are in there somewhere." The hero stalls the fight, holding back to avoid inflicting any serious injury, focusing on trying to snap the friend out of it. Sometimes the effect is less than total salvation, only giving the friend the willpower to off themself or let the hero off them. This can be especially tragic if they've been Fighting from the Inside just to give them the opportunity.

Only the Ideal Hero can pull this baby off. It's usually saved as a Moment of Awesome for them, to show just how amazingly, totally, completely _awesome_ they are. It's also a pretty big deal for whoever manages to snap them out of it.

Heroes beware, for it does not always work. They could discover, to their horror, that the friend was Not Brainwashed or they could be Wrong Genre Savvy, use the line, and then discover that it really _is_ too late to save them. In some of the more tragic cases, something remains of their friend, but it is only a faint echo, who can barely muster to come through long enough to beg the hero to either run away and save themselves, or kill them and put them out of their misery. Can also accidentally cause their friend to have a Identity Breakdown if the struggle to reassert their identity is too mentally taxing. An inversion of this trope is Heroic Willpower, reversing the hero and sidekick's roles.

See also Battle in the Center of the Mind, Cooldown Hug, Fighting Your Friend, Beat the Curse Out of Him, and Defusing The Tykebomb. Contrast Sheathe Your Sword, where the hero wins without fighting, but usually there isn't a relationship between the protagonist and antagonist. See "They Still Belong to Us" Lecture for the villain version. Compare Deprogramming, a far more drawn out process. See also Resist the Beast.

-   _Big Finish Doctor Who_;
    -   In "Destroy the Infinite", the Fourth Doctor tries this on Davent after he is converted to an Infinite Warrior, and he pauses when his family is mentioned.
    -   In "Wirrn Isle", a brief example of this occurs when Veronica is talking to a Wirrn that has been merged with her son Iron in a transmat accident. When the Iron-Wirrn talks to Veronica over the radio claiming that it could be possible to separate him from the Wirrn, the Doctor begs 'Iron' to stop tormenting his mother that way if there is any part of his original self still in whatever he has become, but admits after the radio falls silent that he wasn't seriously expecting that to work.
    -   In "Project Destiny", when the Doctor's old friend Cassie Schofield is brought back to "life" as a near-mindless vampire corpse, the Seventh Doctor is able to get through to Cassie by revealing that her current "target" is her long-lost son Tommy (now the Doctor's companion Hex).
    -   In "The Skull of Sobek", Lucie and the Eighth Doctor are chosen as the champions of the two big bads, who have been feuding for centuries. The Doctor won't have anything to do with it, but Lucie falls prey to her big bad's mind control and becomes hell-bent on killing him. During the ensuing fight (though it's probably more accurately described as a chase because the Doctor won't hurt Lucie and in the end she didn't land any blows anyway), he never actually uses the phrase "I know you're in there somewhere", but he says just about everything else you might expect.

-   _Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Lost Tracks of Time_: Cool Big Sis Sneasler falls under the control of the Red Chain, and it's up to Ingo and Emmet to free her before she kills them. They employ this trope to distract her enough for Ingo to destory the chain controlling her. It works.
-   _A Possible Encounter for a Phantom_:
    -   Danny tries this when Kim is possessed by Spectra. It works.
    -   She later returns the favor when he's under the Rage Pearl but ends up having to kiss him because of how the pearl works.
-   In _Power Rangers Mythos_, when five Rangers from the past are pulled into the year 2600 to face the alien alchemist Avanth, the last surviving Ranger of the 2600-team is able to retrieve Tommy Oliver, Z Delgado and Flynn McAllister, but Avanth captures and brainwashes Shelby Watkins and Adam Park to fight on his behalf. Z attempts to invoke this when she first faces Adam in a fight, and Tommy makes a similar effort when he has his first one-on-one confrontation with Adam, but Avanth’s control is too entrenched for her either of them to help Adam shake him off that easily.
-   In _The Prayer Warriors The Threat Of Satanic Commonism_, Jerry is forced to fight against a "demon processed" Grover. Unlike most cases of this, Jerry is entirely willing to kill Grover if necessary, and ends up doing so (not that this is the first or last time Grover dies).
-   In the _Power Rangers Zeo_ fic "Queen of Harts", when the other Rangers demorphing fails to break Tommy out of his brainwashing ("King for a Day"), Zordon and Alpha are able to send Kimberly in to try and break the conditioning herself.

-   In _Rabbit of the Moon_, Bell uses the Tiny Music Box to try to restore Gascoigne's sanity so he could return to his daughter's side. But his efforts are ultimately in vain, as Gascoigne only regains enough clarity to beg for forgiveness from his wife before completely turning. As if to punctuate the point, Bell is in such emotional and physical pain that he leaves the box behind as he goes to kill Gascoigne. He tries it again with Henryk, trying to appeal to Henryk's relation to his granddaughter, but Eileen is forced to do Henryk in despite Bell's insistence that he could have been saved.
-   Basically goes without saying in the _Stargate SG-1_ fic "Remnant" when the Goa'uld Zipacna takes Daniel as a host and falls back on his usual rant about how nothing of the host survives. Sam immediately realises that's a lie as Zipacna tried to trick her into revealing SG-1's IDC, something he should have known immediately if he had full control of Daniel, and Daniel is even able to take enough control to stop Zipacna raping Sam in his body, even if he can't stop Zipacna committing 'lesser' tortures.
-   In _The Rise of Starborn_ Thor convinces Loki to fight the Goa'uld's mind control.
-   _Spider-X_:
    -   Rogue says this word-for-word when the symbiote starts to take Peter over.

-   In _Torque (Jak and Daxter)_, there is no fighting, but Keira does attempt to reach out to the Dark Warrior when they come face to face with one another and some part of him recognizes her, with mentions of Daxter, hinting that some part of Jak is still there under the surface of the Dark Warrior.
-   Unfortunately, the brainwashing spell in _Tower of Babel_ is too powerful to break with the power of friendship. Weiss will not stop until he either fulfills his orders or the spell itself falls apart.
-   Zig-Zagged in Ridyr's _TRON: Legacy_ fanfic _Survivor's Tale_. Yori was captured and Clu decided to have Rinzler execute her, as much for dramatic irony as to get her out of the way. Yori figured out who was under that mask and started trying to talk him out of it, more for his sake than hers. With Clu shouting orders from one end and Yori arguing from the other, he becomes paralyzed by confusion. Later, after Yori's been rectified, Rinzler was still too confused by her presence to dismiss her as just another drone, and inverts the trope by freeing her, despite being unable to either free himself or completely understand his reasons for doing so.
-   _Ultimate Video Rumble_: Thanks to Morrigan's brainwashing, we have Yuri Sakazaki vs. Mai Shiranui in the second Rumble, and Athena Asamiya vs. Sie Kensou in the third.
-   _Winter War_: When it is revealed that Ichigo has lost control of his Hollow side, Ikkaku envisages pulling off something like this, during/followed by a massive fight which would end in Ichigo regaining control and running off to kill Aizen. Much later on, Ikkaku's angry speech has no effect on Hollow!Ichigo.
-   _With this Ring... (Green Lantern)_: As dueling Star Sapphire, Katma Tui uses her Power Ring to help the real Carol fight the split personality possessing her.
    
    Both women were panting as if they'd run a marathon. Their costumes were sweat-stained, and their muscles trembled with effort. They alternated closing their eyes in concentration and trying to stare the other one down.  
    Katma could see what Hal meant about the Predator in Carol's visage. It had twisted her face into one of the most cruel and arrogant aspects she had ever seen on a woman, on Korugar or elsewhere.  
    But in the depths of her eyes, Katma seemed to sense something more. Something a bit trapped, a bit different.  
    Encouraged, she tried pouring on more will. It had to be enough. It had to reclaim Carol from the Star Sapphire.
    
-   Happens towards the end of the _Star Trek (2009)_ fic _Writtenin The Stars_; Spock, suffering from the effects of Pon Farr, becomes crazed and violent, and can't even remember the rest of the crew...except for Fem!Kirk. She takes it upon herself to try and pull this trope on him. It doesn't work, so she brings him back to himself by...relieving him of his pain.

    Literature 

-   _The Legend of Drizzt_:
    -   Drizzt has one in R.A. Salvatore's _The Dark Elf Trilogy_ against a zombified Zaknafein, his father. The zombie has all his father's amazing sword skills but is impervious to wounds. Finally, Drizzt attacks him with a maneuver that triggers his memory of one of their fondest moments, which allows Zaknafein's spirit to break his controller's hold just long enough to leap into the pool of acid they are fighting over, thus saving Drizzt and his own soul.
    -   In _The Neverwinter Saga_ Drizzt tries this with Entreri during the Fight against Herzgo Alegni during wich Entreri is under the control of the a magical sword. He succeeds, but only after almost being killed, because he had to stop fighting break the enchantment.
-   _Animorphs_:
    -   In the series, controllers often experience this. It is possible for hosts to briefly regain control at a crucial moment, although usually not long enough to do anything lasting.
    -   Also in the second _Megamorphs_ book, Rachel talks Tobias into regaining control of his dinosaur morph by first telling him about all the human stuff from his life; this promptly fails and she resorts to bird things, which _does_ work. He _is_ after all, trapped with a red-tailed hawk as his "normal" form, and therefore spends a lot of time flying around. A bit strange though, because hawks are basically just weird-looking dinosaurs. Not to mention that the dinosaur morph Tobias is in is a raptor, which does a lot of things birds do anyway. They hunt prey with their talons, have flight feathers and wings, and a few species can even fly somewhat.
-   In the Grand Finale of Rick Riordan's _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_ series, Annabeth pep-talks Luke into fighting Kronos, and Luke eventually establishes enough control of the shared body to reveal his 'Achilles' Heel' and sacrifice himself with Annabeth's knife.
-   Zigzagged in Gav Thorpe's _Warhammer 40,000_ _The Last Chancers_ novel _Annihilation Squad_. When Kage is possessed by a daemon who goes to taunt Colonel Schaeffer, Schaeffer does not appeal to Kage but bitterly attacks the daemon, "He is one of mine! I want him back!"

-   In _A Wrinkle in Time_, Charles Wallace has been taken over by the evil IT; Meg saves him with The Power of Love, quite literally.
-   Subverted in Tad Williams' _Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn_ — Rebellious Princess Miriamele travels all the way back to the Hayholt in an attempt to use The Power of Love to pull her father, King Elias, back from the brink of the war he's started at Evil Sorcerer Pryrates' urging. Of course, she's far, far too late to prevent the evil plan from being completed, but in an ironic twist, Elias _does_ repent for a split second after being temporarily released from the Storm King's power, just long enough for Miriamele to kill him.
-   Near the end of _Skulduggery Pleasant: Death Bringer_, the end of the Skulduggery/Lord Vile and Valkyrie/Darquesse battle is something of one of these.
-   Creel has one of these with Velika in _Dragon Slippers_ when the slippers take over her mind.
-   Said word-for-word in _Divergent_ when Tris confronts Tobias while he's under the effects of a mind-controlling serum.
-   In _The Shining_, Danny uses his "shining" to reawaken his father's spirit long enough for him to say how much he loves him before the Overlook Hotel obliterate what's left of his soul.
-   In the _New Jedi Order_ novel _Conquest_, Anakin Solo does one of these for his friend (later girlfriend) Tahiri, who is under the control of her implanted Yuuzhan Vong personality. It's very successful, thanks to their link through the Force at first. Turns out that Riina, aforementioned Yuuzhan Vong personality, wasn't subsumed but merely banished into Tahiri's subconsciousness — she ends up forced to go through a Battle in the Center of the Mind and Split-Personality Merge to finally end the problem.
    -   In _Galaxy of Fear: Spore_, Tash Arranda faces her Spore-controlled brother and uncle and appeals to them while calling on the Force and the bonds between them and her. It works for a moment, but Spore is too strong. Fortunately, she was doing this as a distraction so she could knock them out.
-   _Mockingjay_ features a version of this after Peeta has been hijacked and tries to kill Katniss.
    
    **Katniss:** Don't let him take you from me.
    
-   Lorelei and Malachi engage in one in Eludoran
-   Zigzagged in _The Power of Five_ - Scott was brainwashed into working for Nightrise during the book of the same name, but his brother Jamie was able to snap him out of it at the last minute before he could kill Senator Trelawney. However, he never fully regained his old personality, and the Old Ones were able to use this to their advantage to turn him against the Five in _Oblivion_. He then managed to snap himself out of it after Matt died, sacrificing himself so that the Five could be reunited once more.
-   The villain in _Eden Green_ sometimes falls into a psychotic, murderous fugue state, and blames it on the needle virus keeping him alive. The title character repeatedly tries to reason him back to sanity, with mixed results.
-   _Ancillary Justice_. Strigan doesn't understand why Breq wants to kill Anaander Mianaai, so assumes the original personality of her Meat Puppet is re-surfacing, and offers to help restore it.

Audrey begs him to remember who he was in life, and after an inner struggle, he does. They have a tearful farewell as he finds peace and crosses over to the other side.
-   A classic example in _My Best Friend's Exorcism_ occurs when the power of Christ fails during the exorcism.

-   In the _Warrior Cats_ book _The Place of No Stars_, Ashfur mind-controls Squirrelflight's mate Bramblestar into attacking her. She calls to him to remember who he is, and her plea is enough to help loosen Ashfur's grip, until Shadowsight arrives and distracts Ashfur enough for the two of them to get away.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_ tie-in novels: Kamahl somehow manages to get into these fights regularly. First, in _Chainers Torment_, he has one with Chainer. He's briefly on the receiving end in _Judgment_ when his sister Jeska tries to snap him out of his Mirari obsession, and then later has one against his newly-zombified friend Balthor. Then in _Onslaught_, he is once again pitted against Jeska after she's transformed into Phage the Untouchable.
-   In _Knights of the Borrowed Dark_ Denizen tries this on a Brainwashed and Crazy Grey - it doesn't break the enthrallment but he manages to fight it just long enough to let Denizen escape.
    -   Neatly averted later on when Vivian comes up against Grey. She's well aware that he's in there somewhere and equally aware that there's nothing she can do about it, so she delivers a ruthless Curb-Stomp Battle and leaves him lying in the mud in order to confront the Clockwork Three, who are behind it all.
-   In _The Unorthodox Chronicles_, one way to free a thrall is to remind them who they actually are. Unfortunately for Grimsby, the thrall he's facing is his long-time bully, and the only way to free him is to let him beat Grimsby up, just like old times.

    Music 

-   Mega Man tries to pull this off with his brother in _The Protomen_'s _Act I_. To say it doesn't work is putting it lightly.
-   Hatsune Miku pulls this off with **her fandom** in the song _Innocence_, tying to stop a Flame War by reminding them why they loved Vocaloid in the first place.

    Tabletop Games 

-   On _One Life to Live_, having finally realized that ex-wife Viki isn't Viki at all, but one of her many personalities (she suffers from DID), Clint proceeds to do and say everything he can to get Viki to come back. And when she finally does, he says and does everything he can to prevent the other personalities from taking over again—when she mentions that her vision is going blurry and that she can't focus, he realizes that Jean (who needs glasses to see) is trying to resurface and basically shakes her to keep her from passing out.
-   In the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG, "Marauding Captain", recalling his and the past cooperation of "Gogiga Gagagigo", appears to be trying to reason with "Gogiga Gagagigo" in Memory of an Adversary. The circumstances could have been the cause of the transformation of "Gogiga Gagagigo" into "Gagagigo the Risen", through the purification of his soul.

    Theatre 

-   In Noah Smith's stage version of _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_, during the final confrontation between Utterson and Hyde, Jekyll is able to take partial control of his body to prevent Hyde harming Utterson, following Helen appealing to him by name. It's only temporary, but it's enough to shift the balance and bring about Hyde's defeat.
-   In _Zanshin_ and _Urazanshin_, Zessekyo takes over the minds of one of the focus teams, and the other has to have this kind of fight with them.

    Toys 

-   Happened not once, but TWICE with Lewa in _BIONICLE_. First his mask got replaced with an infected, mind-controlling one. Onua had to knock it off his face. Later, a Bohrok (which are machines controlled by an organic face-brain) places its Krana (face-brain) at Lewa, making him more than willing to join "the swarm" and "cleanse the island". Onua showed up again, but this time it was this trope, as he refused to hit his friend. (Never mind that he gave Lewa a pretty good beating last time...) Lewa ripped the Krana of his face himself this time.
    -   Also appears in _Web of Shadows_ when Matau fights a face heel turned Vakama.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Dracu-Riot!_ plays with this in a hilarious manner:
    -   In one chapter, Kouya hypnotizes Azusa and Naoto before Yuuto could arrest him. Yuuto counters this by telling Azusa that he's actually a lolicon and Naoto that he's also gay for him, the most outrageous things he could think of at the moment in order to break them free of the control. After he was successfully arrested, Azusa was convinced that Yuuto was indeed a lolicon, while Naoto actually serious considered about it.
        -   It didn't help either that a few scenes prior to what has happened above, Yuuto was actually working undercover as a lolicon while being paired with a partner who has the appearance of a child. His acting was so convincing that even his colleagues started to doubt whether he secretly might be a lolicon.
-   Subverted in the Ciel Story Arc in _Tsukihime_ where the protagonist is the reincarnation of the Big Bad and is only a matter of time before he would be completely possessed. Ciel his friend, sempai and current Love Interest who is secretly an immortal exorcist sent by the Church asks him to get to the school by night to help him. But her true intention is to fight him and kill him because she knows there is no cure and bears personal hatred against the Big Bad. It is only because the protagonist refuses to fight her to the death and to hate her for being deceived that she realizes she cannot do it.
-   In _Sunrider Liberation Day_, Chigara is suddenly taken over by the Big Bad and begins massacring the delegates attending the Liberation Day ceremony. Kayto tries to talk her down, reminding her of who she really is and how she isn’t the type of person who would do these things. Thanks to the Power of Love, Chigara is able to regain control and kick the BigBad out of her body… only to be shot by a third party and die in Kayto’s arms.

    Web Animation 

-   _DC Super Hero Girls_: In "Out of the Bottle", Art Teacher Miss Moone has been taken over by her evil split personality, and Harley Quinn tries to reach her out:
    
    **Harley Quinn:** Ms. Moone, I know you're in there. So listen up!  
    **Enchantress:** (wheezing) June Moone is no more. I consumed her!  
    **Harley Quinn:** Yeah, right! That's exactly what someone who **didn't** actually consume Ms. Moone, but was scared that my maneuvers might work, would say!
