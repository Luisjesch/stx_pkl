_"I’m still not sure what exactly the game plan with this week’s outing was, beyond 'Hey, remember_ Aliens_?'"_

Sometimes rather than just a brief reference or homage to some other work of fiction, a work will actually be a full-blown recreation of something else's story. This is most commonly done in sitcoms, and is likely a spoof to at least some degree.

Expect it to reference/parody the original's Signature Scenes.

Contrast Homage Derailment where references to a plot or scene get subverted for shock and humor.

Tropes Are Tools — a story can serve as a reference or re-mixed version of another one without just ripping it off. Clever parodies put a lot of their own creative thought in while still referencing the original.

Compare Parody Episode, Whole Costume Reference (the clothing version) and Recycled Script (internal recycling). May be a Twice-Told Tale. For when this is subverted, see Not His Sled. The opposite would be a Shallow Parody, which claims to be a parody but has almost no real references to either the plot or any other aspect of the target.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Astro Boy_: The titular character's origin story bears more than a few parallels to _Pinocchio_. Knowing Osamu Tezuka, this was almost definitely intentional. He's remade stories from _Faust_ to _Crime and Punishment_ to _The Bible_.
-   _Blame!_ draws _very_ heavily on the Iain Banks novel _Feersum Endjinn_ for many elements of the setting and story (the Net/Cryptsphere, its substrate in the megastructure, the system corruption, the governing authority's attempt to restore order, the reincarnating Chief Scientist plotting against her boss, the wanderer walking the Earth until he can incarnate the child that will fix the Sphere). If _Feersum Endjinn_ hadn't wrapped up the story itself, _Blame!_ could easily have been a sequel.
-   The Bount Filler Arc of _Bleach_ is exactly the same as the Chapter Black arc of _YuYu Hakusho_ up to the point that everyone enters Soul Society. What's especially noticeable is the beginning where Urahara's test to show Ichigo he relies too much on bankai is almost identical to Genkai's test to show Yusuke that he runs in without knowing enough about his enemies.
-   _Cheat Slayer_ is Garth Ennis' _The Boys_ with isekai protagonists instead of super heroes.
-   _DARLING in the FRANXX_:
    -   Episode 10 shows that life in the Plantation inner city is basically _Brave New World_, and the kids are pretty much one of the lower classes used by the "adults" for their needs.
    -   The plot of "The Beast and the Prince", the book that shows up in Episode 13, is strikingly similar to Hans Christian Andersen's version of _The Little Mermaid_.
-   Episode 15 of _Digimon Adventure 02_ is a reference to _Kaiketsu Zubat_, complete with Yolei and Hawkmon delivering a recreation of Zubat's Once an Episode declaration that he can prove he's better than the villain of the week at their signature skill.
-   Episode 18 of the _Dirty Pair_ TV series is a straight-up remake of the Clint Eastwood movie _The Gauntlet_, with the girls filling in for Clint.
-   The entire _Dragon Ball_ universe is an adaptation of the story of Son Goku, the Monkey King. One guess which character represents Son Goku.
-   The Tower of Heavens arc in _Fairy Tail_ is one massive reference to the Etherion arc from _Rave Master_. The subtlety of the points where the older story is referenced varies. (Having the villains of each arc virtually identical was not that subtle, but some of the moments found are not ones you would notice if you didn't know to look.)
-   An episode of _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig_ is a futuristic homage to _Taxi Driver_, and another is a homage to the sniper shootout at the end of _Full Metal Jacket_. Lampshaded by one of Section 9's junior members, who thinks that Saito is pulling one over on them: The story Saito tells over their poker game is entertaining, but there is "an old movie" with the same plot.
-   _Hello Kitty_ once did "The Little Match Girl". Yes, with the original ending. There's an entire series of Hello Kitty and her friends performing fractured fairy tales called _Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater_.
-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ is basically a modern day retelling of _The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter_, just with one of the five suitors taking the place of the emperor. Most of the major characters' names and personalities are derived from the story in one way or another.
-   _Love Hina_:
    -   An episode is based on the Chinese tale of Son Goku, the Monkey King.
    -   Also, one of the manga chapters was based on the tale of Taro Urashima. Guess who gets to be Urashima.
-   _Lupin III: Part II_ spent an episode remaking _Murder by Death_ (with a different set of No Celebrities Were Harmed detectives, and set on a zeppelin for some damn reason).
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury_ is essentially William Shakespeare's _The Tempest_ IN SPACE!, with some Gender Flips to make it queer; A wizard (or witch in this case, Prospero/Elnora Samaya) is wronged and exiled alogside their daughter (Miranda/Ericht) at the hands of a powerful and influential figure (Antonio the Duke of Milan/Delling Rembran). The exile ends up in a distant, desolate place (the island/Mercury) and become that place's leader. Years later, they hatch a plot to get revenge by having their daughter marry the son (or in this case daughter) of the man who wronged them (Ferdinand/Miorine), using an entity named Ariel/Aerial. Elnora even changes her name to Prospera to avoid being recognized.
-   _Monster_ broadly mimics the story of the Beast from _Revelation 13_, but there are many subplots which mirror many popular fairy tales, including _Beauty and the Beast_, _Hansel and Gretel_, and _The Pied Piper of Hamelin_. There is also an in-universe example, in that the characters unwittingly enact the plots of Bonaparta's fairy tales and his son's puppet show.
-   The episode "The Lilliputian Hitcher" of _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ is a not-quite-completely-following-the-original-plot homage to the film version of Michael Crichton's _The Andromeda Strain_.
-   _Oddman 11_ is _Scott Pilgrim_ as a raunchy Yuri harem comedy with Cute Monster Girls. The inspiration for the plot is even referenced in the very first chapter.
-   _One Piece Film: Gold_: A film featuring an All-Star Cast, setting in a Casino City as background, involving a convoluted heist against a powerful evil casino owner in order to rescue a crew mate, only to find out this convoluted plan is the cover to another plan in order to trick the casino owner. Are we talking about this film or Ocean's Eleven?
-   _Ouran High School Host Club_ has a manga chapter based on _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_, and a considerably looser adaptation in one episode of the anime.
-   _Patlabor_:
    -   _Mobile Police Patlabor: The Early Days_: "The 450-Million-Year-Old Trap" is a hilarious _Gojira_ send-up, down to the one-eyed Mad Scientist and the "Oxygen Destroyer" (actually a bit of dry ice in a plastic tube).
    -   Episode 15 of the New Files OVA are essentially a fusion of the finales of _Ultraman_ and _Ultraseven_ with characters from Patlabor, down to Noa being able to transform into an Alphonse-inspired Ultraman Copy.
-   _Pokémon: The Original Series_: "Battle Aboard the St. Anne", and "Pokémon Shipwreck", two episodes of a three-part arc, are directly inspired by _The Poseidon Adventure_.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_:
    -   The anime itself bears many, _many_, resemblances to Goethe's _Faust_. Not to mention that Sayaka's character arc is a reference to _The Little Mermaid_ (The original Hans Christian Andersen tale, _**not**_ the Disney one with the happy ending). Homura's experiences in Episode 10 are reminiscent of Phil Rogers' repeated attempts to save the homeless man in _Groundhog Day_.
    -   Its movie sequel, _Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie: Rebellion_, is one to _Paradise Lost_. With some homages to _The Nutcracker_ as well.
-   _Prétear_ is _Snow White_ made into a Magical Girl series.
-   The _Queen's Blade_ animated adaptation has three of them per season:
    -   The plot of the first season mimics somewhat the plot of _Odin Sphere_, especially the Gwendolyn's story on Leina and her family. Heck, even both Leina and Gwendolyn shares the same voice actress as well, except the plot is less depressing than in the game.
    -   The plot of the second season resembles somewhat the one used in _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_, including the warriors fighting in their own (or their opponent's) home turf and the fact the winner will rule the land for four years.
    -   The plot of the sequel, _Queen's Blade Rebellion_ (but only in the novelizations) is a mix between the plots of _Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon & the Blade of Light_ and _Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem_ and some aspects from the Chinese classic _Water Margin_ (the one who _Suikoden_ took inspiration of) and even some aspects from _Star Wars_. Especially the main villain being the mother of two of the main heroines, Annelotte and Aldra.
-   _Urusei Yatsura_ episode 75 is based on Agatha Christie's novel _And Then There Were None_ — the episode's title actually means "and then there were none", and it uses a different nursery rhyme ("Who Killed Cock Robin") in the same manner that the novel uses the nursery rhyme "Ten Little Indians".
-   The _Space☆Dandy_ episode "There's Music in the Darkness, Baby" (Episode 15) borrows heavily from the narrative style and visual design of _Courage the Cowardly Dog_. Ukuleleman would not look, sound, or act out of place if he were suddenly transplanted to _Courage_ and made the focus of an episode.
-   The entire run of _SSSS.GRIDMAN_ is unusual in that it's a reference to a plot that doesn't actually exist, as many of its plot points are homages to the unused preproduction material from the original _Denkō Chōjin Gridman_. _SSSS.DYNɅZENON_ follows suit by pulling nearly all of its major plot elements from one particular episode of the original show.
-   In an episode of _Strawberry Marshmallow_, Miu tells the story of _Cinderella_, with Matsuri as Cinderella, Chika and Ana as her stepsisters, Nobue as the prince, and herself as the Fairy Godmother. Miu being Miu, however, it's riddled with all sorts of weird additions and changes, and ends up with _the Fairy Godmother_ marrying the prince as compensation for her falling down the stairs twice. She figured the original had a messed-up moral, which, if it's true, means she wants a thousand yen for the beauty salon.
-   _The Tailor of Enbizaka_, aside from building off of the song it's named after, features large elements from the Japanese folktale of Momotaro, with the primary character being born from a tree, meeting 3 friends who symbolize the animals Momotaro befriends, and going to a place called Onigashima and dealing with a demon there.
-   Episode 40b of _Tamagotchi_ is about the Tama-Friends acting in a TAMAX-TV television show. The show mimics the plot of _The Little Mermaid_, with Lovelitchi as the mermaid who becomes lovesick after seeing Mametchi the pirate and resorts to some kind of magic to travel onto the land and find him.
-   One chapter of _Yandere Kanojo_ retells "Cinderella".
-   In _YuYu Hakusho_, the gang fights a team of baddies who are perversions of the main characters from various Japanese myths.

    Asian Animation 

-   The _Simple Samosa_ episode "Aampur Ke Choley" copies the plot of the Bollywood film _Sholay_, with Jalebi cast as the _dacoit_ (bandit) leader and Samosa and Dhokla taking on the roles of the film's two protagonists.

    Audio Plays 

-   _Big Finish Doctor Who_:
    -   In keeping with the "gothic horror" vibe of Season 14, "The Valley of Death" is _Heart of Darkness_ with a bit of _She_.
    -   "Return of the Rocket Men" borrows heavily from various Spaghetti Western stories, but the final encounter particularly references _A Fistful of Dollars_ with Steven's virtually identical plan for defeating the gangster terrorising the town.

    Comic Books 

-   The European western graphic novel series _McCoy_ once did a remake of the movie _Comanche Station_ called _Mescalero Station_. Everything in the movie was in the graphic novel, including the twist ending.
-   _Batman: Son of the Demon_ takes the plot of _On Her Majesty's Secret Service_ practically whole cloth and applies it to Batman. A hero allies with the head of a known criminal organization to stop a mutual enemy. The hero marries his criminal ally’s beautiful daughter as part of their pact (but also because he kind of wants to). Due to the machinations of the villain, the marriage quickly ends in tragedy.
-   "Leavetaking", a story in the _Batman: Black and White_ anthology series, reprises the parable of the Good Samaritan, with Batman in the role of the gravely injured man whom nobody will stop to help. In this updated version, the passersby include an African American teenager, an alcoholic, and a policeman who refuses to help because he doesn't want to deal with the paperwork he'd have to do. In the end, this being Gotham, there is no good samaritan, and Batman has to summon up his heroic willpower and drag himself to an emergency room.
-   _A Stranger in Town_ is based on _Django_. In both stories, the protagonist arrives in an isolated settlement with a large and mysterious box that turns out to contain a BFG, and then uses that weapon against an army of invaders.
-   The _Major Grom_ story _St. Patrick's Day_ is a retelling of the _Taken_ film series, with St. Petersburg investigator Igor Grom taking the place of American government agent Bryan Mills, his girlfriend Yulia taking the Kim Mills role, and a Dublin wing of the IRA subbing for the films' Albanian terrorist cell. It's especially obvious with the stories' respective villains: compare _Taken_'s Albanian terrorist Patrice Saint-Clair to Murdock Macalister, the head of the _Saint Patrick's Children_.
-   _Marvel Fairy Tales_: _X-Men Fairy Tales_ is a series of these, casting the X-Men in the role of characters from various fables. Followed up by _Spider-Man Fairy Tales_ and _Avengers Fairy Tales_.
-   Sometimes in _The Spirit_ Will Eisner would create new versions of fairy tales, set in the 1940s.
-   _Górsky & Butch_ do a brief _Matrix_ parody in their first book. In the third one, they do a more extended parody: Butch makes a Face–Heel Turn, joining the agents of Comix, in hope of achieving his goals and finally ending the senseless plot so he can star in a 'real comic'. In the meantime Gorsky leads the resistance under the guise of Morfinius, attempting to destroy the Comix by making Jerry (the heroes Butt-Monkey sidekick) the main character. They also do _Aliens_ at one point: the whole section of the comic is the movie but it turns out to be an illegal copy with borked subtitles: all sorts of whacky hijinks result from it, most importantly the aliens getting replaced with sheep because their name have been misspelled (makes sense in Polish) - the marines discover a nest with missing colonists hanging on the walls in oversized wool sweaters.
-   The comic book version of _Pv P_ did a homage/parody of _The Matrix_ called "The Comix".
-   There's a _Star Wars_ Expanded Universe comic featuring Luke's childhood friend Janek "Tank" Sunber, who'd joined the Empire, become a lieutenant, and ended up stationed on a planet of tribal aliens. The plot of that handful of comics is essentially _Zulu_, with Imperials desperately fighting wave after wave of aliens and being worn down.
-   _Judge Dredd_ did this quite a bit in the late 80s and 90s, with parodies of such things as _The Wizard of Oz_, _Twin Peaks_, _Edward Scissorhands_, and many more.
-   The whole Hellfire Club section of the _X-Men_'s _The Dark Phoenix Saga_ is basically Chris Claremont's riff on _The Avengers (1960s)_ episode "A Touch of Brimstone", in which Mrs. Peel becomes the Hellfire Club's Queen of Sin under the "authority" of John Cleverly Cartney.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Claremont even gives Mastermind the real name Jason Wyngarde, after Peter Wyngarde, who played Cartney, and Jason King, Wyngarde's most famous role.
    -   Similarly, the famous Claremont & Byrne issue where Kitty Pryde has to survive against a demon for a night is self-consciously, deliberately just the two creators riffing off "the last fifteen minutes of _Alien_."
-   The story of Steve Rogers' return to the land of the living, _Captain America: Reborn_, is an extended reference to _Slaughterhouse-Five_.
-   The plot of the Marvel Comics villain miniseries _Identity Disc_ is taken directly from _The Usual Suspects_.
-   The plot of _Avengers Arena_ bears more than a passing resemblance to works like _Battle Royale_, _The Hunger Games_, and _Lord of the Flies_, which the writer gleefully owns up to in the first issue. Additionally, the covers of the first few issues are all homages to the movie posters and book covers of the above-mentioned stories.
-   Several DC Comics Elseworlds do this. Most of them are very obvious about it (_JLA: Island of Dr Moreau_ is based on, well...), but one that plays it a bit more subtly is the _Legion of Super-Heroes_ Elseworld _Castles in the Sky_, which is a 30th century riff on Arthurian Legend, with Cosmic Boy as King Arthur, Saturn Girl as Guenevere, Lightning Lad as Lancelot, R. J. Brande as Merlin, Lightning Lord as Mordred, Mordru as the Fisher King, the flight rings as Excalibur (only Rokk can pull the Nth metal from the ruins of Thanagar), and the Miracle Machine as the Holy Grail.
-   The first four issues of _Adventure Time: Banana Guard Academy_ are a specific parody of the original _Police Academy_.
-   Many reviewers have noted a similarity between the first couple issues of _All-New Wolverine_ to _Orphan Black_, to mixed reception. Though to be fair, Laura herself being cloned has been a plot thread almost as long as she's been in the books, and it's a major reason why the Facility has spent the better part of a decade (both real-life and in-universe) trying to get her back.
-   _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_: Some select stories homage other works in their entirety. For instance, one Italian one was based on _Fahrenheit 451_, just with the Ducks living in a dystopia where all music is forbidden. There's also a Danish one based on _The Shining_, though obviously with less ax-murder.
-   _Camp Lazlo_: A story features a lake monster and Lazlo treats the case like a Scooby Doo mystery. There's a "Mystery Latrine" with a sign painted the same style as the Mystery Machine, Lazlo and his friends split up ("Tradition dictates that we all split up and explore!", Lazlo says), someone theorizes the "monster" is some Corrupt Corporate Executive wanting the land for mining rights and, when the monster is revealed to be the squirrel scouts just out for a midnight boat ride, Lazlo remains convinced that Patsy is someone wearing a mask.
-   _Clone Wars Adventures_: _A Stranger in Town_ is based on _Django_. In both stories, the protagonist arrives in an isolated settlement with a large and mysterious box that turns out to contain a BFG, and then uses that weapon against an army of invaders.
-   Marvel's original _Conan the Barbarian_ run adapted one of his creator's short-stories _The Shadow of the Vulture_, which was based on historical events rather than taking place in Hyboria, set during the Great Turkish War where the Ottoman sultan Suleyman the Magnificent sets one of his best hunters to kill a knight for offending him and he teams up with a red-haired swashbuckler known as Red Sonya to survive. Conan replaces the knight, Suleyman is replaced by an Turanian warlord and Red Sonya is transformed into Red Sonja, who actually debuted in this story.
-   The final battle of _Miracleman_ is basically a Played for Drama riff on the classic _MAD_ story _Superduperman_. A Superman Substitute with a loser alter-ego and heavy Unscrupulous Hero tendencies faces off against an Expy of Captain Marvel, who has turned evil for the sake of using his powers for his own gain. The hero fails to damage the villain due to them being equally invulnerable, and the battle wrecks most of the city. Eventually, the hero manages to circumvent the villain's invulnerability by exploiting his powers, but in the aftermath, he ends up alienating his Love Interest.
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   _Spidey Super Stories_ had a two-fer with _Star Jaws_, which combined _A New Hope_ and _Jaws_ by having Dr. Doom pilot a space station whose goal is to literally eat the Earth.
    -   Issue #4 of Saladin Ahmed’s run on _Miles Morales: Spider-Man (2018)_ is titled “Miles Morales’ Day Off” and features Miles, his friend Judge, and his love interest Barbara faking a sick day to skip school, with the overly intense Vice Principal Lyle Dutcher in the role of the Dean.
-   Batman and the setting of Gotham wears its _Zorro_ influence on its sleeve, to the point that the movie that the Waynes had gone to see the night of Thomas and Martha's murder is typically _The Mark of Zorro_.
-   _No One Left To Fight_ is essentially Dragon Ball if Goku never got married and enemies stopped appearing after the Buu saga; the authors specifically said that part of the intent was to play around with the stories of Goku and Vegeta and present their own take on it.
-   _Watchmen_ is this to Percy Bysshe Shelley's _Ozymandias_, though this may not entirely be too apparent on an initial reading (which speaks volumes of Moore's writing skill). In the end, the results of the Fallen Hero Ozymandias' schemes have pretty much gone the way he'd planned them to go. Earth's leaders are now collaborating to better keep the world safe from the threat of war. But in the end, this peace is on a very shaky foundation that can easily be shattered by the notes written in Rorschach's journal — the "stronger loving world" that Adrian has created is _still_ standing on the precipice of the apocalypse. In short, his efforts may very well be rendered meaningless due to forces outside his control. This parallels the ultimate fragility of the original Ozymandias's great achievements, which he believed would be memorialized eternally, only to instead be buried under the desert dunes and forgotten by the passage of time.
-   The _Paperinik New Adventures_ story "Timewreck" heavily references the Disney Ducks Comic Universe story where Donald first met the Time Police, the biggest difference being that in PKNA the Time Police' ability to track a stranded time traveler is very approximate in both timespan and location due Paperinik having changed the timeline (it's stated it would be otherwise just as good and they'd have been able to show up at his exact location right after he got stranded).

    Fan Works 

-   The _Doctor Who_ fanfic setting _This Time Round_ has enough of these that they have their own section, "Story Time!".
-   An old _Slayers_ fan comic posted on the Internet featured the cast putting on a production of _Hamlet_, with such gems of casting as Zelgadis as Hamlet and Prince Phil as Polonius. Hilarity Ensues.
-   _Pretty Cure Perfume Preppy_ is a rather unlikely example, as every so often it parodies episodes from actual TV shows instead of the usual things. To list what the author referenced so far: _The Backyardigans_, _The Powerpuff Girls_, _Code Lyoko_ (three times so far!), and even _Power Rangers: Dino Thunder_. Make that of what you will.
-   _Brave New World_ is pretty much a Darker and Edgier retelling of _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_. But with Pokémon!
-   The _Fullmetal Alchemist_ fanfic "Who's Your Daddy?" is essentially one to _Look Who's Talking,_ with a side order of _Three Men and a Baby_. One of Roy Mustang's one-night stands shows up with the infant son who resulted from their time together, hands him over, and disappears. He shoulders the task of fatherhood, relying on his devoted subordinate Riza Hawkeye to help him while he tries to find his son the perfect mother. Just about the time he realizes she's been there all along, the baby's real mother tries to take him back.
-   There is an entire genre of _Harry Potter_ fanfic, the "Harry is sent to Azkaban" genre, which varies between homage, this, and knockoff of _The Count of Monte Cristo_.
-   The _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_ fanfic _Decks Fall Everyone Dies_ is a recreation of _Moulin Rouge!_, altered to fit the Yu-Gi-Oh universe.
-   _The Best Night Ever_ is a _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfic that retells _Groundhog Day_ using Prince Blueblood getting stuck in a loop of the events of the season one finale "The Best Night Ever".
-   The following is a brief summary of the plot of _Portal 2_: an evil AI is accidentally reactivated after several years by a clumsy yet lovable Personality Core and takes total control of the research facility it was built in, and a determined test subject sets out to stop the rogue AI's reign of terror. Now compare this plot to the plot of _My Little Portal_. You'll come to realize it's exactly the same.
-   "The Five Calvins" from _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_ is really just "The Five Doctors" under a "Calvin and Hobbes" filter.
-   _The Non-Bronyverse_ has two, one of which copies the plot of the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ episode "Feeling Pinkie Keen", and another that takes the plot of _My Little Dashie_ and replaces Rainbow Dash with Rarity.
-   _Vinyl and Octavia Duel Destiny_ is a giant one to the _Ace Attorney_ series. See the fanfic page for specific details.
-   Several fandoms are disturbingly fond of WPRs to _Jurassic Park_, with the characters from the crossover in the roles from the story. Fandoms who have tried this vary from the reasonable (_Total Drama_, being that it's not impossible that Chris McLean is connected to In Gen and John Hammond in some way) to the WTF (_Sonic The Hedgehog_ and _Harry Potter_? The hell?).
-   _The End of Ends_ is one for Super Paper Mario.
-   Fittingly, _Cave Story Versus I m Meen_ is clearly one of these for both _Cave Story_ and _I. M. Meen_.
-   _The Final Quest of Star Swirl the Bearded_ is a story about the ancient history of _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic_, in which the wizard Star Swirl the Bearded organizes an adventuring party—consisting of a squad of pegasi and the earth pony Humble Pie—to evict a dragon from an old pegasus stronghold. The author has freely admitted that _The Hobbit_ was his inspiration. But because ancient Equestria is _not_ the same as Middle Earth, the plot does deviate from _The Hobbit_ at some key points, particularly the ending.
-   A fanfic taking place after _The Black Cauldron_, _Hope for the Heartless_, is strikingly similar to the plot of the infamous _Beauty and the Beast_ story: a young smart peasant girl is imprisoned in a scary castle for months by a monstrous royalty who can save himself from a Fate Worse than Death only by gaining a human's love. Slowly the prisoner and her captor grow closer, with a turning point being when the captor scares the prisoner to flee the castle on horseback and then saves her from Savage Wolves, nearly dying in the process. The prisoner then nurses her captor back to health.
-   _Pony POV Series_:
    -   Nightmare Manacle's mini arc in the Finale is basically _Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie: Rebellion_ with Rainbow Dash/Nightmare Manacle as Homura, Twilight Sparkle as Madoka, Pinkie Pie as Mami, Bright Night as Bebe, etc. It at least ends happier than the original.
    -   One special chapter of the Finale is one to the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "Tapestry". Golden Tiara deeply regrets a horrible mistake she made in the past and wishes it never happened, only to be shown that if it never happened, she would have never learned to appreciate what is truly important in life and become a total loser. Some of Picard and Q's lines even get paraphrased.
-   _Kingdom Crossovers_ is a retelling of _Kingdom Hearts_ with Zim in the role of Sora, Calvin and Hobbes in the roles of Donald and Goofy, and more.
-   The discontinued prequel to _Sonic X: Dark Chaos_, _Fall of the Seedrians_, is basically a retelling of _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_ with the Seedrians as the Colonials and Tsali/the Tsali Endoskeletons as the Cylons. The only difference is that it ends much, much worse.
-   _Equestria: Civil War_ is based on _Captain America: Civil War_. After Starlight Glimmer causes a major accident that injuries many innocent ponies, an act of checks and balances against all former antagonists is made. The mane 6 and all of Equestria are split on the act and divided into two factions, with Princess Twilight leading the faction against the act supporting the right for a former villain to choose their own destiny, and Moon Dancer leading the other to support accountability and consequences.
-   A Recursive Fanfiction of the _Both Syllables_ series called "For The Irken Who Has Everything" is, as one might assume, based entirely on _For the Man Who Has Everything_.
-   The _Halloween Unspectacular_ anthology series has a few examples:
    -   "You Have Died of Dysentery" from the original HU is _Oregon Trail_ with _Spongebob Squarepants_ characters.
    -   "Unidentified Flying Object" from HU3 was originally meant to serve as the prologue of an _Independence Day_ clone that the author never got around to writing.
    -   "Cause and Defect" from HU8 is one to TomSka's "PIZZA TIME" skit...which leads to E350 getting sued by him in the end.
-   _I am \[REDACTED\]_ is a recreation of the love story of Superman and Lois Lane with Izuku Midoriya and Ochako Uraraka, in a post-canon Alternate Universe where Izuku went to America for hero school instead of UA so he could maintain a Secret Identity.
-   _Lost In The Storm_ follows the events of _The Odyssey_, staring May Marigold as Odysseus. The events are slightly out of order, but otherwise match closely with the events of the original epic, including the Lotus Eaters, the Cyclops, the Wind-god Aeolus, Scylla and Charybdis, and the journey into Hades.
-   _TheSavageMan100_ had wrote many _Fairy Tail_ stories that involved the cast of the manga in different Disney films.
-   _Ruby Pair_: The chapter "My Fair Tenn" is based on the _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_ episode "My Fair Mandy".
-   _the ringing in my ears gets violent_ is _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_ featuring _Resident Evil_ characters. Notably, Chris Redfield fills in the role of Captain America while Leon Kennedy ends up as the Winter Soldier.
-   _Ben 10: Unlimited_: In the second sequel, _Unlimited Justice: Part 2_, the "Gods, Demons, and Heroes" arc serves as one to the Oracion Seis arc from _Fairy Tail_ right down to the antagonists and their plan, though replacing Jellal with Brainiac and Wendy with Ms. Marvel.
-   _The Bugger Anthology_:
    -   "The Clash at Dalekdome" is a recreation of the The Clash at Demonhead sequence from _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World_, down to also having a cover of "Black Sheep" by Metric.
    -   "IRON DALEK" spoofs the first half and The Stinger of the first _Iron Man_ movie.
-   The _Ace Attorney_ fic _Turnabout Alphabet_ is one to _Ella Minnow Pea_, involving the Khura’in government prohibiting English letters that fall off a statue representing the pangram "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." For extra stakes (and because the author reasons that _Ella Minnow Pea_ would exist in the _Ace Attorney_ world), the protagonists not only have to find a shorter pangram but also one that translates an existing Khura'in proverb.
-   _All That Is Necessary_ is a _Miraculous Ladybug_ fic with the plot of _Gone_, where Paris and its children 14 and under are trapped under an impenetrable dome, and instead of Miraculous and Akumas they are young children developing their own super powers.

    Films — Animation 

-   Gristle and Bridget's storyline from _Trolls_ is one for _Cinderella_, complete with Bridget losing a rollerskate at the pizzeria's steps and Gristle picking it.
-   _The Incredibles_ is essentially an adaptation of _Watchmen_. In a world where most superheroes have died or gone into retirement and/or hiding, a villain (a tech magnate who wanted to be a hero earlier but was rejected) has a plan to stage a crisis by unleashing a tentacled horror on a major city, with many further parallels. Both even include a reference to a hero dying because their cape got snagged on something.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Forbidden Kingdom_ is either a remake of the tale of Son Goku, or its "prequel".
-   _Mandalay_: To Rudyard Kipling's eponymous poem. The poem is about a working-class, British soldier whose boring life in London pales in comparison with the time he spent in the city of Mandalay (part of British India). In the film _Mandalay_, the protagonist goes from a miserable life in Rangoon (also part of British India) to Mandalay; therefore, her route is not quite equal to that of the soldier. Tanya does, however, arrive there in a ferry boat — the soldier goes back to London in a paddle steamer, so both of them travel by water. The city of Mandalay, nonetheless, holds the same connotations of freedom (and getting a romantic partner there) as the poem. Unfortunately, there's a tweak — the city is currently ravaged by the Black Fever, so she's kind of doomed anyway.
-   _My Own Private Idaho_ keeps dropping in and out of the plot of Shakespeare's _Henry IV_.
-   _Epic Movie_ was essentially the storyline of _The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe_ with a Shallow Parody of everything else they could think of bolted onto it. Likewise, _Meet the Spartans_ did the same for _300_, as did _Disaster Movie_ for _Cloverfield_ and _Vampires Suck_ for both _Twilight_ and _New Moon_.
-   Similarly, most of the first _Scary Movie_ follows closely the plot of _Scream (1996)_ (with some scenes from the second and a slew of late '90s horror in-between), and the second is mostly based on _The Haunting (1999)_. (The others have the main plot being an amalgam instead, with the third being a mix of _The Ring_ and _Signs_, and the fourth mixes _War of the Worlds (2005)_, _The Village (2004)_, _The Grudge_ and _Saw_.)
-   _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_ is based off of Homer's _The Odyssey_. Although the entire plot is only loosely similar, there are certain parts that mirror the source material quite closely, such as the cyclops and the sirens.
-   _Barb Wire_ is basically _Casablanca_ with more boobage.
-   _The Confirmation_: To _The Bicycle Thief_, another film about an impoverished father trying to recover stolen property that he needs for his new job, while being accompanied by his young son.
-   _Strange Brew_ puts the MacKenzie brothers in the role (sort of) of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in a loose adaptation of _Hamlet_. The brewery is called Elsinore.
-   _The Cheap Detective_ combines the plots of _The Maltese Falcon_, _The Big Sleep_, and _Casablanca_.
-   Now, rip-offs of _Alien_ or _Aliens_ are legion, but the movie _Carnosaur 2_ repeats the whole plot of _Aliens_ almost scene by scene, with Distaff Counterparts of Ripley and Newt, and dinosaurs instead of the Xenomorphs (with a _Tyrannosaurus rex_ stand-in for the Alien Queen).
-   _Spiders_ replaces the Xenomorphs of _Alien_ with giant spiders, and eventually sets them loose in a city, allowing for giant monster sequences.
-   While Mel Brooks is fond of referencing/parodying films, classic and contemporary, in his works, _Spaceballs_ is essentially a cross between _Star Wars_ and _It Happened One Night_.
-   Akira Kurosawa's done a couple of these.
    -   _Throne of Blood_ was basically _Macbeth_ in medieval Japan.
    -   _Ran_ could be considered _King Lear_ in medieval Japan.
    -   _The Bad Sleep Well_ is _Hamlet_ in 1960s Japan, though a looser adaptation than the previous two.
    -   Some critics argue that _Yojimbo_ is _Red Harvest_ with samurai. In turn, _A Fistful of Dollars_ and _Last Man Standing_ are _Yojimbo_ with American gunfighters. Kurosawa sued Sergio Leone over the similarity with _A Fistful of Dollars_.
-   _A Thousand Acres_ is _King Lear_ on an American farm.
-   With the success of _Clueless_ - a retelling of Jane Austen's _Emma_ set in a modern high school - a wave of similar teen comedy versions of classic fiction appeared on the market:
    -   _She's All That_ for _Pygmalion_.
    -   _10 Things I Hate About You_ for _The Taming of the Shrew_.
    -   _Get Over It_ for _A Midsummer Night's Dream_.
    -   _Cruel Intentions_ for _Dangerous Liaisons_.
    -   _O_ for _Othello_.
    -   _Beautiful Devils_ for _Othello_.
    -   _She's the Man_ came along later but is still this to _Twelfth Night_.
    -   _Easy A_ missed the bulk of this trend by a few years, but it’s this to _The Scarlet Letter_.
-   Although it isn't apparent at first, _Transformers: Dark of the Moon_ is a combination of two G1 cartoon episode plots: the three-part episode "The Ultimate Doom", with the Decepticons attempting to transport Cybertron to Earth via space bridge and then enslave humans to restore it to its former glory; and the two-part episode "Megatron's Master Plan", where the Decepticons receive the help of several treacherous, sycophantic humans, also resulting at one point in the Autobots being exiled from Earth, and their chosen means of escape destroyed in transit by the machinations of the Decepticons, though the Autobots survive in both cases. It also copies a lot from the _Doctor Who_ episode "The End of Time".
-   The plot of _Ip Man 2_ heavily borrowed from that of _Rocky IV_. This includes: a rival-turned-friend killed in a fight against a foreign fighter, the main character training to avenge his death, and the fact that the fighter in question was supposed to be an unbeatable juggernaut. Ip Man himself went as far as giving a speech promoting tolerance like Rocky did after he won the match.
-   _Outland_ is _High Noon_ on a space station.
-   _Assault on Precinct 13_ is _Rio Bravo_ in 1970s Los Angeles.
-   One of the _Bring It On_ sequels, _In It to Win It_, is _West Side Story_ with cheerleaders instead of gangs. The two squads are even called the Sharks and the Jets.
-   _Teaching Mrs. Tingle_ is essentially a (semi)serious/teen thriller rehash of _9 to 5_ without the awesome cast (except Dame Helen Mirren of course)
-   _Airheads_ borrows _numerous_ plot points from _Dog Day Afternoon_. This becomes especially apparent in the second half of the film, where the crowd outside comes to side with the hostage-taking lead characters, just like in the original film.
-   _Kingsman: The Secret Service_ being a riff on Roger Moore era James Bond, Valentine's plan is quite similar those from _The Spy Who Loved Me_ and _Moonraker_: He intends to trigger a massive depopulation of humanity while he and a number of individuals deemed worthy hide out in a secure location.
-   _Juan in a Million_: To _The Quiet Earth_. Man wakes up finding the world empty of people. Man searches fruitlessly. Man goes crazy from the isolation. Man finally finds another person. Man finally takes matters into his own hands and ends up in an ending that doesn't make much sense.
-   _Do You Believe?_: To _Crash_. Both are hyperlink stories featuring a large number of central characters with their own storylines that eventually converge in a car crash, though _Crash_ deals with race and _Do You Believe?_ deals with faith.
-   The Kevin Sorbo film _What If?_, in which he plays a wealthy, atheist businessman and is taken by an angel to an alternate universe where he is a happily married preacher with children because he chose to stay with his girlfriend rather than leave her, has many similarities to the Nicolas Cage film _The Family Man_, where Cage plays an unmarried wealthy businessman who is taken by an angel to an alternate universe where he is a humble, happily married family man for the same reason.
-   _The Faculty_ for _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_. One Genre Savvy character also points out that _Invasion_ took a lot from a book called _The Puppetmaster_.
-   Struck by Lighting for Classical Mythology, the story of Icarus. Although this time not Apollo but Zeus kills the protagonist instead.
-   _Cloud Atlas_: The entire structure of the story bears a _very_ strong similarity to Osamu Tezuka's manga _Phoenix_, including the time jumps, the themes of resurrection and of intertwined fates, the denouement set After the End and much more. The individual stories also qualify:
    -   "An Orison of Sonmi~451" has several key similarities to _Brave New World_, such as the foundation of a dystopia following a Great Offscreen War, mandatory consumer quotas, tailor-made clones, a populace kept happy with psychoactive drugs, and a rebellion informed by modern literature. Sonmi actually reads _Brave New World_ halfway through her story.
    -   Adam Ewing's plot to _Moby-Dick_ (with Melville and whales being mentioned frequently), and Cavendish's story to _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_ (he saw the film once).
-   _Italiano Medio_ starts as a _Limitless_ parody, but it actually follows closely _Fight Club_ if one thinks about it: dissatisfied man has a wild, outgoing alter ego who makes his most secret fantasies become true, becomes part of a group of eco-terrorists, and when their plot is set in motion he no longer wants to be part of it.
-   _Gleahan and the Knaves of Industry_ has been described as "_Don Quixote_ for the modern age," but they only share the same initial premise. The actual plot varies wildly from the classic Spanish novel.
-   _The Rapture_: Sharon is basically Job questioning God at the end. Unlike him though, she doesn't reconcile with God.
-   _Fulltime Killer_ is a riff on _Assassins_, with the top assassin in the world being targeted by a Young Gun rival, and a girl in the mix. The Genre Savvy young gun specifically states that he's modeling their rivalry after the film.
-   In _Machete Kills_, the Big Bad's evil plot is a hybrid of those of two James Bond movie villains, Carl Stromberg in _The Spy Who Loved Me_, and Hugo Drax in _Moonraker_.
-   _Prometheus_ is essentially a retelling of H. P. Lovecraft's classic story At the Mountains of Madness but set in the Alien universe: A science expedition travels to an isolated place and uncovers the ruins of a lost civilisation, and also uncovers the Awful Truth that humanity is nothing more than a failed genetic experiment, and our alien creators would much prefer to be rid of us.
-   _Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?_ is one to "Hansel and Gretel." Christopher notices the similarities, which causes him to incorrectly assume Aunt Roo is a cannibal.
-   _Airplane!_ is nearly a shot-for-shot remake of the 1957 film _Zero Hour! (1957)_ (but with about a million times more jokes).
-   _Blame (2017)_: The plot builds increasingly to a parallel with _The Crucible_ (its start at least), with the play being put on in the story as well.
-   _The Vindicator_ is a modern-day take on _Frankenstein_, with the good doctor's creation now being a cyborg. This is reflected in its alternate title, _Frankenstein '88_
-   Godzilla (2014): Much of the film's plot bears close resemblance to Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book story, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, with Godzilla taking the role of Rikki and the two MUTO as the cobras:
    -   The MUTO are a mated pair, in which the femals is bigger and more dangerous
    -   Godzilla is their natural enemy, who indirectly benefits the humans by hunting them
    -   Godzilla fights and kills the male MUTO first, while the nest of eggs is destroyed, enraging the female
    -   The female directly threatens a primary human character in retaliation, but is saved by Godzilla who arrives in time to kill her
    -   Godzilla becomes viewed as a 'protector' of sorts by the humans

    Literature 

-   _A Court of Thorns and Roses_:
    -   _A Court of Thorns and Roses_ is inspired by _Beauty and the Beast_ (Feyre is an impoverished merchant's daughter with two sisters, who has to make a deal to live with a mysterious beast. The mysterious beast turns out to be a handsome royal under a curse, and it is her love that will break the spell) and later the myth of Cupid And Psyche (Feyre is set three difficult tasks by a cruel and envious queen in order to be reunited with her love interest; after completing them she is magically turned into an immortal being). It's also inspired by the Scottish ballad of "Tam Lin"; besides this being where Tamlin gets his name from, the plot concerns a young human woman who must rescue her lover from the Queen of the Fairies.
    -   _A Court of Mist and Fury_ is inspired by the myth of Hades and Persephone (Feyre, a lady of the Spring Court, is whisked away by the sinister ruler of a land with a dark reputation, and must remain there for a set amount of time. Said ruler is revealed to be Not Evil, Just Misunderstood, has fallen in love with her and makes her his queen. It also turns out the land has some unexpectedly beautiful and benevolent parts, where Feyre resides. Oh and the loved one she left behind in the Spring Court pitches an almighty fit when she disappears).
    -   _A Court of Wings and Ruin_ is loosely inspired by _Snow White_; Feyre eats an apple containing faebane that temporarily causes her to lose her power, the villain is an evil monarch with magical powers (albeit a king rather than a queen), the villain is betrayed by a subordinate who helps the protagonists, there's a subplot involving a magic mirror that shows your true self, and the scene in which Rhysand dies and Feyre begs the High Lords - of which there are seven including her - to save him out of love loosely resembles the seven dwarfs watching over Snow White until she's brought back to life by the prince.
-   Several _Discworld_ novels are referential parodies of famous works. For instance, _Wyrd Sisters_ spoofs _Macbeth_, _Lords and Ladies_ parodies _A Midsummer Night's Dream_, and _Maskerade_ parodies _The Phantom of the Opera_. _Night Watch Discworld_ is _Les Misérables_ with time-travel thrown in, and _The Truth_ parodies _All the President's Men_. However, most of these examples throw in a significant twist: _Wyrd Sisters_ elevates the Witches Three to protagonist status and sets them against the counterparts to Macbeth and his wife, _Night Watch_ replaces the original Inspector Javert with Sam Vimes and Valjean with a genuinely dangerous criminal, and _The Truth_ has a shadowy conspiracy trying to _depose_ a mostly benevolent (if pragmatic to the point of ruthless) ruler instead of keep a corrupt President in office.
    -   An honourable mention goes to _Hogfather_, which takes time out of its "The Grim Reaper is Subbing for Santa" plot thread to reference _The Little Match Girl_... and have _Death himself_ decide that this is just too bloody depressing to stand for and Rules Lawyer his way to saving her.
-   _A Dowry of Blood_: Well the book is meant as an origin story of the brides of _Dracula_ it also takes a lot from the story of _Bluebeard_ with a naive wife whose murderous husband demands she not see his things in his special room, only for her to discover that he murdered his previous spouses.
-   Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story "A Scandal in Bohemia" can be read as a remake of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Purloined Letter".
-   The Star Wars: Medstar Duology is heavily referentially to the show _M\*A\*S\*H_, including the setting (a backwater jungle), the fact that one character can hear the medical transports before they come in, and even direct Cold War ideological debates.
-   The second book in the "Tennis Shoes" series of Mormon fiction is called _Gadiantons and the Silver Sword_. The heroes must take the titular sword to a land far to the southeast and cast it into a box in a mountain where it was forged, while being pursued by servants of Satan who want to recover it. The similarities with _The Lord of the Rings_ could fill its own page on this wiki, starting with the main character's sister remarking on the similarity of their situation.
-   This has been done a number of times with the classic novel _The Count of Monte Cristo_, resulting in the novel _Revenge_ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  by Stephen Fry, SF classic _The Stars My Destination_, and the Filipino classic _El Filibusterismo_, right down to the main character's arc.
-   _The Laundry Files_ is full of Shout Outs, but the plot of _The Jennifer Morgue_ is a whole plot reference to _James Bond_. An _in-universe_ whole plot reference: the bad guy uses Post-Modern Magik to make himself untouchable by anyone but a person who resembles James Bond, and as a side effect develops a tendency to monologue.
-   The plot of the first _Rivers of London_ book is a whole plot reference of _Punch and Judy_ of all things.
-   _Man-Kzin Wars_: _The Children's Hour_ by Jerry Pournelle and S. M. Stirling does a whole-plot lift of the movie _Casablanca_, except at the end when "Ilsa" dumps "Lazlo" and runs off with "Rick".
-   The story "Honor in the Night" from the third _Star Trek: Myriad Universes_ book applies the series' For Want Of A Nail premise to the Original Series episode "The Trouble with Tribbles". The end result can be summed up as "_Citizen Kane_ in the Star Trek universe".
-   _Hyperion_ (the first novel of the _Hyperion Cantos_) is mostly a recreation of _The Canterbury Tales_... IN SPACE! Specifically, the device of having pilgrims tell each other stories en route to the site of pilgrimage to keep each other entertained. It also emulates Chaucer in having each tale copy a different style of story that was popular in the writer's time (making _Hyperion_ a series of classic Science Fiction homages wrapped inside of a Chaucer homage). However, unlike Chaucer, Simmons finished _Hyperion_, and wove it into a four-book saga.
-   _A Necklace of Fallen Stars_: Kaela purposefully recites to Kippen a slimmed down version of her own story about a headstrong woman who rejects an arranged marriage and ends up falling in love with a traveling musician. "A Necklace of Fallen Stars" is Kaela's roundabout way of confessing to Kippen that she loves him and wants to stay by his side.
-   _Trapped on Draconica_: The "Eastern Alliance" arc bears a stunning likeness to _300_ though the author throws in a number of twists and other elements. Notably: the line about The Emperor fighting "free men"; Gothon's offer to Kazem is similar in theme and purpose as Xerxes; 300 Proud Warrior Race Guys guarding a narrow pass; and a Last Stand.
-   _Lowlands Of Scotland_ is a four book series by Liz Curtis Higgs, fairly faithfully retelling the biblical story of Jacob, Leah, Rachel, and Dinah, set in the late-1700s (and early-1800s, post timeskip) Scottish lowlands. It works amazingly well considering the disparity between biblical culture and eighteenth century Scottish lowland culture.
-   _There and Back Again_ by Max Merriwell is _The Hobbit_ IN SPACE.
-   A Whole Subplot Reference occurs in David Weber's _Safehold_ novels. The on-screen confrontation between Gray Harbor and Duke Tirian in _Off Armageddon Reef_ plays out almost _exactly_ like the off-screen one that occurred in _Honor of the Queen_ (also by Weber) between Howard Clinkscales and Jared Mayhew.
-   _The Phoenix Guards_ is described by author Steven Brust as a blatant rip-off of _The Three Musketeers_. Its sequels follow the sequels to _The Three Musketeers_ more loosely.
-   _Streams of Silver_ by R.A. Salvatore, while not parodic and while having some entirely different elements, takes its basic idea from _The Hobbit_: An exiled heir to a dwarven mountain kingdom travels and adventures with a group of companions to retake the kingdom from a dragon. It also mixes in elements from the mines of Moria in _The Lord of the Rings_: the monster that has taken over the dwarven halls is a creature of shadow that attacked the dwarves when they Dug Too Deep, and one of the heroes plunges into the depths with it after a climactic showdown at a bridge.
-   _The Sundering_ is modeled very closely on _The Lord of the Rings_, except told from the villains' point of view.
-   _Sweet Valley High_: When Jessica lands the lead in the school play, her understudy constantly fawns and gushes over her, etc. Jessica is Genre Savvy enough to be suspicious. Sure enough, the girl is trying to undermine her in order to get the part for herself—_All About Eve_ in high school.
-   Subverted in _Ethan Banning_ novel _Undertow_, which, at first, appears to be a recreation of H.P. Lovecraft's _A Shadow over Innsmouth._ It then goes in its own direction.
-   _Conan the Barbarian_ pastiche _Conan and the Treasure of Python_ by John Maddox Roberts is a complete rip-off of _King Solomon's Mines_.
-   _The Four Horsemen Universe_: The Short Story "Unto the Last—Stand Fast" is a Fantasy Conflict Counterpart of the Stand of the Swiss Guard by way of Sabaton's song about the battle, "The Last Stand", even using lyrics from the chorus as a Trust Password.
-   "Sorcerer Conjurer Wizard Witch" is _Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy_ with magic, action sequences involving Murderous Mannequins, and a twist ending that isn't in the original.
-   Victor Norwood's novel _Night of the Black Horror_ is basically an uncredited expansion of Joseph Payne Brennan's popular Blob Monster short story "Slime". Norwood essentially takes the entire short story and uses it as the first few chapters of his book, just changing the characters' names. Once he runs out of material to rip off — we mean, copy from Brennan (that is, once he reaches the ending of "Slime" where the Army kills the thing with a flamethrower), a fairly generic "Army vs. the monster" plot takes over.
-   Vox Day's fantasy series _The Arts of Dark and Light_ does this with George R. R. Martin. While the details of the stories are quite different, the general theme of _A Throne of Bones_ (the first book in TAODAL) can be read as "What would _A Game of Thrones_ have been like if Eddard Stark had had Cersei executed and taken over the kingdom, instead of sparing her and thus getting killed himself?" (In the equivalent situation, things don't seem to turn out much better for the good guys when they try to be ruthless.)
-   The System Divine trilogy by Jessica Brody and Joanne Rendell consisting of “Sky Without Stars”,”Between Burning Worlds” and “Suns Will Rise” is Les Misérables in space.
-   _Sam the Cat: Detective_: _The Maltese Kitten_ to _The Maltese Falcon_, complete with the seemingly valuable kitten being replaced with a fake, although the Brigid and Cairo Expys aren't villains.
-   The premise of _Forty Millenniums Of Cultivation_ is basically "what if Warhammer 40,000 was in the Spirit Cultivation Genre?"
-   _The Great Zoo of China_: While it incorporates plenty of Matthew Reilly's signature fast-paced action, in addition to having some very critical commentary on the Chinese Communist Party, _The Great Zoo of China_ is essentially _Jurassic Park_ at its core—not helped by being released just as the hype train for _Jurassic World_ was getting into full swing.
-   _Mr. Majeika_: To _Gulliver's Travels_ as _Mr. Majeika on the Internet_ includes modernized parallels to the lands of the Lilliputians, Brobdingnagians, Laputans, and Houyhnhnms, as well as a mouse named Gulliver.
-   _Villager A Wants To Save The Villainess No Matter What_ has a plot structure that's a full recreation of the first volume of _Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs_. In some regards it could be seen as a Fix Fic, as it takes out controversial elements like replacing its Jerkass protagonist with someone much more relateable, and removing the Lady Land aspect. Specific scenes recreated include the protagonist being hired to guide idiot princes through a dungeon, and the Villainess condemnation/Throwing Down the Gauntlet event.

    Music 

-   The album _Animals_ by Pink Floyd is a retelling of _Animal Farm_, although the allegory is modified for British society at the time.
-   _King Kong_ from Daniel Johnston's _Yip/Jump Music_ is basically the entire plot of the film _King Kong_ in song.
-   Slint's "Good Morning, Captain" is based off of _The Rime of the Ancient Mariner_.
-   "Little Red Riding Hood" by Sam The Sham & The Pharaohs is from the Big Bad Wolf's perspective.
-   Within Temptation:
    -   "Hand Of Sorrow" is about Fritz from _Realm of the Elderlings_.
    -   "Jillian" is based on _Deverry_.
    -   "Ice Queen" is about _The Snow Queen_.
-   Daughtry's "Waiting For Superman" contains multiple references to Superman to describe a woman trying to find her ideal lover.
-   Nick Cave's "More News From Nowhere" has two stanzas loaded with references to _The Odyssey_.
-   "Clarissa" by Mindless Self Indulgence is one big reference to _Clarissa Explains It All_.
-   "Monster" by Meg and Dia is based off a short story inspired by _East of Eden_.
-   "A Girl Like You" by The Smithereens retells the story of _Say Anything..._...which is pretty bad since the song was commissioned for the film. The song ended up getting rejected from the film, but released as a single separately.
-   "Weird Al" Yankovic does this every now and then; "Jurassic Park", "The Saga Begins" and "Ode to a Superhero" are all pretty comprehensive retellings of _Jurassic Park_, _The Phantom Menace_ and Sam Raimi's first _Spider-Man_ film, respectively.

    Music Videos 

-   The video for the Anthrax song _Inside Out_ plays out like the plot of _The Twilight Zone_ episode "Nightmare At 20,000 Feet".
-   Wonderwall's "Song For You" video is a reenactment of "Overload" by the Sugababes. The songs themselves are distinct.
-   Fall Out Boy's video for the version of "Irresistible" with Demi Lovato serves as a Whole Plot Reference and a pseudo-sequel to \*NSYNC's video for "It's Gonna Be Me". The concept of the video not only allowed them to commentate on their status as "accepted underdogs" in the mid-2010s pop scene and give a respectful shoutout to one of the biggest boy bands ever, but also let them goof off with long time friend Demi Lovato and two-fifths of N\*SYNC.
-   Cat Hairballs by Ren & Stimpy more or less recreates the plot of the episode The Cat That Laid The Golden Hairball, with Stimpy being made to "hwarf" up hairballs onto a conveyor belt for Ren, only to be worked to the point of torture and by the end experience a Heroic RRoD. The video even climaxes with the episode's iconic moment where a completely used-up Stimpy falls onto the conveyor belt and gets brutally stamped across the ass. Since it's referencing its own series, it also counts as an Internal Homage.

    Podcasts 

-   The _Cool Kids Table_ game _All I Want for Christmas_ is a riff on the plot of _Jingle All the Way_. Jake claims that the two stories actually take place at the same time, just in different cities.
-   On _Chapo Trap House_, the tabletop roleplaying storylines are retreads of funny political scandals In the Style of H. P. Lovecraft. The first campaign is the (Republican) Pizzagate conspiracy theory; the second is based on Eric Garland's (Democrat) "game theory" conspiracy theory.

    Radio 

-   The storyline in _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1978)_ dealing with the Golgafrincham B Ark is a reference to the _Doctor Who_ storyline "The Ark In Space", with the Captain even giving a Title Drop to that storyline in his dialogue.
-   In a particularly obscure example, the _Nebulous_ episode "The Lovely Invasion" is a very close parody of an early _Doctor Who_ episode "The Claws of Axos". Additionally, the episode "The Deptford Wives" is just _The Stepford Wives_ with a little _Jurassic Park_ thrown in for good measure.
-   The third season of _Revolting People_ had "A Kiss is Just a Kiss", in which Sam found himself in a version of _Casablanca_, and "Over the Rainbow", in which Mary went Off to See the Wizard.
-   _That Gosh Darn Hippie Show_: The show did a parody of the episode "It's a Good Life" from _The Twilight Zone (1959)_. The Manhattan Transfer song "Twilight Zone" even plays at the very end.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The _d20 Modern_ adventure _A Funny Thing Happened At Carousel #5_ is pretty much a Choose Your Own Adventure version of _What's Up, Doc?_, even having Expies of most of the cast as Non-Player Characters (and one of them even being named after director Peter Bogdanovich!)
-   _Fate of Cthulhu_, with its plot about heroes with knowledge from a Bad Future out to change history and stop the rise of an Eldritch Abomination, isn't subtle about its influence from _The Terminator_. The only thing stopping it from entirely embodying a Terminator Twosome is that having a second time traveller out to stop the players isn't necessarily the rule, though one of the adventure seeds does have them run into their Evil Twins.
-   One of the adventure paths of _Pathfinder_ had the Player Characters going to a middle-of-nowhere town to retrieve a MacGuffin and pretty much riding into the _Seven Samurai_.
    -   Another _Pathfinder_ example is unusual in being a Whole Plot Reference to a _non-fiction_ book— the first volume in the _Agents of Edgewatch_ adventure path is clearly inspired by Erik Larson's _The Devil In the White City_. It takes place during an exposition very similar to the World's Fair, and features a serial killer who has turned the hotel he runs into a deathtrap for his unsuspecting guests. The fact that the adventure in question is called _The Devil At the Dreaming Palace_ confirms that the similarities are entirely intentional.
-   _GURPS_:
    -   The adventure seeds in the "A Fistful of Tunes You Can Whistle" setting for _Discworld Roleplaying Game_ naturally include versions of _The Magnificent Seven_ and _A Fistful of Dollars_, because that's what a spaghetti western setting is _for_.
    -   A _Pyramid_ article about the Dustmaster road trains that ply their way across Mars in _Transhuman Space_ includes an adventure seed in which the PCs are a Dustmaster crew hired to take three trailers of very expensive whiskey halfway across the planet for one of the Millionaires of Mars, while pursued by a vengeful US/Mars Marshall. The title of the scenario is "We got a long way to go/And a short time to get there".

-   _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_, and the Tim Burton film version, give the titular barber a backstory inspired by _The Count of Monte Cristo_.
-   _The Thousand Year Rose_ has a plot and backstory inspired by Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, with many of the principal characters sharing a Character Archetype with Mario's party members.
-   _Jasper in Deadland_ is based on the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, with a few other myths and legends mixed in. Jasper even gets compared to Orpheus a few times to cement the connection, and to clarify that this isn't the same story with an Adaptational Name Change.
-   _Shucked_: A smooth-talking conman shows up in a rural community in order to extract wealth from the locals, but finds himself falling for the one woman who sees through him, and is eventually accepted by the community despite his con being revealed. Are we talking about _Shucked_? Or _The Music Man_?

    Web Animation 

-   The first season of _Nomad of Nowhere_ is a western/fantasy/anime mashup that follows two women, the tough-as-nails Captain Toth and her cute-as-a-button companion Skout, hot on the heels of the Nomad, an enigmatic individual with mysterious powers, the largest bounty in the world on his head and a surprisingly gentle nature. It's basically Rooster Teeth meets Trigun.
-   _Red vs. Blue: The Chorus Trilogy_ initially seems to be setting this up in regards of _Star Wars_, with the idea of La Résistance vs. The Empire, evil white-armored soldiers, an antagonistic Darth Vader Expy, one of the main heroes using a Laser Blade, and even the name of the planet (Chorus/Coruscant). However, this is completely subverted halfway through the arc in Season 12. From then on out, this trope is actually played (relatively) straight in regards to _The Magnificent Seven_.
-   Episode 3 of _Tomorrow's Nobodies_ is essentially the plot of _Half Baked_ mixed with _Daddy Day Care_.
-   _Ollie & Scoops_: "Old Crumplecranks" is based on certain Fleischer Studios cartoons, especially _Minnie the Moocher_ and _The Old Man of the Mountain_. Poopsie and Rudy decide they don't like living in the city and decide to run away to Mount Cattywumpus. The other cats warn the two about an evil, murderous cat named Old Crumplecranks who lives there, but the two cats ignore the warnings and go to Mount Cattywumpus anyway. Old Crumplecranks shows up and sings a Villain Song introducing himself, . To hammer it in, the Inkblot Cartoon Style and jazz music are used frequently in the episode, and some direct quotes, like the Old Man of the Mountain's "\[I'm\] gonna do the best I can," are used in the episode.

    Webcomics 

-   _Erika and the Princes in Distress_: The plot of each chapter is based on a classic Fairy Tale, often with many elements drawn from their respective Disney adaptation. To note, however, is that while they reprise key elements from the original story, they also tend to vastly deviate from them as a whole.
    -   The first arc is inspired by _Snow White_. A Wicked Stepfather is told by a magic mirror that his step-son is a better chef than him, and sends a huntswoman to assassinate him. The huntswoman cannot bring herself to do the deed, and the Prince, who found refuge in the house of seven miner dwarves in exchange for doing housework, ultimately gets poisoned by a red apple, with the only antidote being a kiss. The outfit of Prince Egg-White and the names of the dwarves are for their part taken right from the Disney movie.
    -   The second arc is loosely based on _Sleeping Beauty_. A wicked witch takes revenge on a prince by cursing him to die if he ever breathes a certain flower scent. A fairy alters the curse so that he would only fall into an eternal slumber until kissed by a princess, and the queen orders all of the flowers in the kingdom burnt. There is however one that they missed, which happens to be in the possession of an old man who turns out to be the witch in disguise.
-   _Pv P_ did a series of strips echoing the plot of _Watchmen_ when the movie came out, but due to the difference in mediums, Scott Kurtz used syndicated cartoon characters and called it "The Ombudsmen". They mapped onto the Watchmen superheroes (Dagwood for Dr. Manhattan, Dilbert for Ozymandias, etc.) surprisingly well.
-   _Jane's World_'s current arc is literally _The Last Star Fighter_ with lesbians.
-   _Just Peachy_ does this in one story arc with the movie _Singin' in the Rain_. They even reference the movie in this strip.
-   Many _Sluggy Freelance_ parodies cobble together from different works in a genre, but the "Torg Potter" storylines were mostly whole plot.
-   _Rhapsodies_ had an episode about the adventures of the house band in _Casablanca_. A later Halloween Episode blends the _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ with _A Chinese Ghost Story_.
-   _Zortic_ before the reboot consisted almost exclusively in this.
-   _Pastamonsters_ has some heavy references to _Gravity Falls_. Most notable are "Not What He Seems" and the Bill Cipher episodes, with Zalgo in Bill's place.
