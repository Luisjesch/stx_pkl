_"While farmers generally allow one rooster for ten hens, ten men are scarcely sufficient to service one woman."_

The Distaff Counterpart of All Men Are Perverts: Women will do anything for sex, and men are the cerebral ones.

This is a Cyclic Trope, having been popular historically, especially in ancient Greece. Back then, it was assumed that women were too sex-crazed to say no to sex, while men were supposed to hold back for the sake of propriety—being too sexual with women was an insult to a man's virility. In many cultures, it is invoked in stories with the moral to marry your daughters off young (usually to older men who can provide for them, protect them, and keep them on the straight and narrow), to prevent their disgracing the family because they just can't control themselves.

This trope which portrays the female conquest/male submission ritual made a comeback first in seventies music in which a female vocalist sings about cruising for and propositioning guys for sex, and then in the early eighties with movies and TV shows in which beautiful, sexually adventurous women are the ones who pick up guys, take them to bed and initiate the sexual encounters. The trope also shows up in some media aimed at men, particularly as a sort of masculine power fantasy with every woman lusting after The Casanova.

Sometimes, a Good Bad Girl doesn't care about the social stigma with putting out, and promiscuity is portrayed positively and a rite of passage or personal growth. **That is not this trope.** This trope would shrug its shoulders and say: "Well, she's a _woman_, what do you expect?'' If the guy isn't willing? Well, that's just too bad. No Guy Wants to Be Chased, but what are you going to do? My Girl Is a Slut, and my fish are wet.

In order for this trope to apply to a modern work, women have to be depicted as man-chasers **by default**. Not just one in particular; that's simply Really Gets Around (for "generic" promiscuity) or a Man Eater (when the woman picks up and then discards lovers like tissue paper). Women in general would say "I am a woman, I can't help it!" It has to be socially expected from women that they'll do anything for the next ride on the trouser rocket. Not because it's in a world where men and women happily engage in the hanky-panky and the nasty together. A world where women are the ones thinking with their crotches and men are the ones thinking with their brains, not one where the former aren't so different to the latter in terms of sex drive.

How much of this trope (or its opposite) has any real basis sparks a huge debate and serious research in the world, with just about any ethologist/sexologist/psychologist having their own point of view, not in the last part because leaning towards either end — this trope or opposite — has _many_ Unfortunate Implications. Current consensus is that the truth must be somewhere in between: either gender can be asexual, and either gender can suffer mental breakdown from unresolved tension, the differences being there for both social _and_ biological reasons. Since females of just about any species are by definition limited in the number of kids they can potentially carry (unlike males), they cannot just go for anything that moves, but neither can species survive if the attraction is one-sided. Remember that mother nature cares not about the social views, but rather has to ensure the steady evolution and replenishment of losses, stimulating _either_ gender towards balanced behavior.

Contrast All Women Are Prudes and compare All Men Are Perverts. Everybody Has Lots of Sex is when both genders more or less equally go for casual sex. In horror, this becomes Psychosexual Horror.

In classic works that personify the Seven Deadly Sins (including Marlowe's _Doctor Faustus_), Lust is usually the one cast as a woman.

    Comic Books 

-   Gina and Brittany from _Gold Digger_ especially, but females in this series tend to gravitate towards the aggressive side when it comes to guys.
-   Anything done by Frank Miller. His female characters are all sexually hungry, with his male protagonists frequently having to reject moves by the Girl of the Week because it's a bad idea right now, what with the cops closing in on the place and all.

-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: Di becomes interested in Steve Trevor after helping treat his injuries while he was unconscious and getting a good eyeful, the Holliday Girls are notorious for being boy crazy, and pretty much every female villain encountered pulls some variation of I Have You Now, My Pretty or Bathe Her and Bring Her to Me on Steve and other men. Then there's Marya who considers American men to all be a "tease" since when she returns an admirer's interest they are not quite ready for what she wants them to do—which is implied but not outright stated to involve multiple men at once—and seems to consider women better in this regard.

    Fan Works 

-   Much like All Men Are Perverts, this trope is _very_ common in rule 34.
-   The _Pokémon_ Lemon fanfic _The Adventures of Ryan and Kirrie_ has the titular Kirrie embody this trope word-for-word. Later chapters just stretch the trope beyond the logical conclusion…
-   _Dragon Ball Z Elsewhere_: On the planet in the afterlife where heroines train. And there is a reason: they have still their bodies, with all their urges, but they cannot meet any male, but every few centuries or so. So, when they see the two young Goku and Yamcha, well in shape, with their bodies, on their planet...
    
    **Random Heroine**: _Gorgeous men! Gorgeous men! Everyone, shave your legs!_
    
-   _The Infinite Loops_: In the original time loop omakes published by Innortal, this was commonly implied to be a result of the ladies slowly going insane due to living the same life over and over again. While it was played for laughs, later contributers shied away from this trope.
-   In _In The Light Of Day: A Frozen Epic_, Anna's friend Hildegard (aka Hildy) apparently thinks of sex constantly.
-   _Maidenless No Longer_: Most of the sexual encounters are initiated by the women the Tarnished saved, rather than the other way around. In fact, while much is made of his plan to save everyone, it's not clear if he ever planned to _sleep_ with any of them before Melina and then Nepheli Loux put the idea in his head.
-   In _The Many Dates of Danny Fenton_, this seems to be Katie Kaboom's biggest flaw aside from her temper, much to Danny's dismay.
-   _New Tamaran_: The female characters crave for sex a lot more than the male ones.
-   In the _Love Hina_ fanfic _Prince of PolPol_, Keitaro is revealed to be the heir to the island throne of PolPol, and ends up married to ALL the Hinata girls. Almost immediately after the ceremony is completed, he is forced to flee from Kanako, Shinobu, Su, Kitsune, Mutsume and Sarah, all of whom want to get into his bed (although Sarah is only pursing him because she's offended by the thought that he doesn't want to have sex with her). Eventually, the first girl to have sex with him is Nyamo.
-   In _Relax,_ another work by the same author, Klee, a prostitute is shown as taking quite a lot of pleasure in her work. This guy likes his lusty, assertive women.
-   Used heavily in _A Pleasant Surprise._ This kickstarts the plot.
-   _A Rabbit Among Wolves_: Ilia can barely hide her affection for Blake. She isn't shy about admitting (in her head) that she finds Trifa and Sienna attractive.

    Films — Animated 

-   _The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad:_ The "Sleepy Hollow" segment features the side character of Tilda, who spends every minute on-screen chasing after Brom Bones. And when Brom and Katrina get married at the end, she immediately demonstrates how enthusiastic _she_ is about the whole idea. All this in a vintage Disney film, no less.
-   Every female in _Batman: The Killing Joke_ is portrayed lusting after another man or openly admitting their sexual relationships.
    -   Batgirl became a crime fighter to gain Batman's admiration and constantly complains to her Gay Best Friend about how she's unable to get laid. Then, after picking a fight with her mentor, she instantly decides to have sex with him right on the rooftop.
    -   The Joker's late wife Jeannie states that one of the reasons she stays with her husband is because he's "good in the sack".
    -   Justified with the prostitutes, since it's a part of the job.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _ABCs of Death 2_: The girl certainly thinks this about her mother in "Y is for Youth". The girl attributes much of her mother's neglect to her being distracted by lust since her husband died, and her stepfather isn't interested in sex. She implies that her mother may even have molested her during her worst fits of horniness.
-   Being an Awful British Sex Comedy, this is present in every _Confessions of a... Series_ film. The genre itself is also rife with this.
-   Virtually all the ladies in _The Devils_ are hormone driven, and the subject of their lust is almost always Urbain Grandier. The "nun orgy" is a particularly notable example of this from the film.
-   _Dr. Jekyll & Ms. Hyde_: Downplayed. Helen Hyde comes on to and sleeps with almost every man she encounters at Richard's job. However, she does so mostly to manipulate her way on top, and is quick to dismiss men who aren't instrumental to that goal. She's also the only woman who behaves this way, with her behavior contrasted with that of Sarah (who is sweet, level-headed, and faithful). Additionally, the men in the movie are just as bad, if not worse, than Helen.
-   Played for laughs in 1955 film _Friendly Persuasion_. Father and son Jess and Josh Birdwell, Quaker farmers, are out traveling the countryside to sell their produce. They stop at a farm that contains a lonely widow and three obviously horny daughters. The daughters nearly eat Josh alive, grabbing at him and staring at him with lust-crazed eyes, before the Birdwells make their escape.
    
    **Widow Hudspeth**: Menfolks are so scarce around here that the girls get carried away at the sight of one.
    
-   _Gentlemen Prefer Blondes_ has a lot of women hanging around a team's workout room while Jane Russell wanders around the room singing the beefy number "Ain't Anyone Here For Love?".
-   Played for Laughs in _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_. When Professor Slughorn shows the class a sample of a love potion, _every girl in the class_ becomes drawn to it and its capabilities.
-   In _I Saw What You Did_, Libby does a lot of fantasizing about a man she has only spoken to over the phone, and says that his voice makes her feel like he is running his hand down her spine. Every action of Amy's is driven by the desire to secure Steve Marek as her lover.
-   No woman keeps her hands off of James Bond for very long. It helps that James Bond is practically The Pornomancer.
-   In _Liar Liar_, Fletcher proving himself to be a skilled Amoral Attorney was all it took for his boss, Miranda, to immediately want to get into his pants. She does.
-   The "Castle Anthrax" scene in _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ is a comedic illustration of this trope, as the girls in the castle are not subtle with their advances to Sir Galahad.
-   Ladies in _40 Days and 40 Nights_, once the main character takes himself off the market. Played with, the women aren't lustful towards the main character because they can't control themselves, they do it to maintain the status quo, with women controlling access to sex, and men having to work for it. If the guys start withholding it, then the power shifts.
-   The 1962 version of _Mutiny on the Bounty_ portrays all Tahitian women this way.
-   In this scene from the abstinence only sex education film _No Second Chance_, this girl's enthusiastic about French kissing and the girl at the 3:17 mark is totally into the group sex idea as shown by the grin on her face.
-   This is an effect of the _Other Halves_ app; it happens to men, too.
-   In _The Private Life of Don Juan_ all the women in Seville want to have sex with Don Juan, it seems. When Don Juan goes to his own funeral he is astonished that all these women who never met him are showing up in mourning clothes.
-   _Sexual Chemistry_: Pretty much all the female characters want to have sex.
-   _Sirens_ puts forth the argument that women are inherently lustful but have been beaten into being prudish thanks to strict religious enforcement. Estella and Giddy are initially repulsed by the sexuality of Sheila and Pru, but soon become intrigued by how free-spirited they are. The two of them embracing their sexuality and becoming more lustful is seen as an example of positive character growth — in Estella's case, greatly improving her marriage.
-   _Spring Breakers_: Every female character in the film is either seeking or having sex, and if not acting sexual while scantily clad, with Faith as the only exception (even she spends much of the film in a bikini alongside the rest of them though).
-   In _Where The Boys Are 84_, Lisa Hartman, Lorna Luft, Wendy Schaal and Lynn-Holly Johnson play four college coeds, who as Lynn-Holly Johnson's character, Laurie puts it, are going to Fort Lauderdale because there are millions of guys just looking for animal sex and debauchery.

    Folklore 

-   There is an urban legend that many colleges in the United States have fraternity houses but not sorority houses because of 19th-century laws that classed any residence of more than five women but no men as a whorehouse. In some cases, this was Truth in Television, but only for so long. Most, if not all, of such laws have long been taken off the books (though not all colleges have built sorority houses since).

    Jokes 

-   In the locker room, men talk about three things: money, football and women. They exaggerate about money, they don't know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women. Women talk about two things in the locker room: sex and men. Not in abstract terms either. They are extremely graphic and technical and they never lie.

    Music 

-   The central theme of most of 3OH!3's music; more accurately "Women are exploitable holes and they _love it_".
-   "Coalmine" by Sara Evans—the main protagonist has "nothin' but the supper on" because she knows that she and her partner are only going to have sex until it's time for him to go back to work the next morning.
-   The theme of Gunther is him being a "ladies man". His band, _The Sunshine Girls_ do the backup singing while moaning and giggling.
-   Olivia Newton-John in the radioactiva remix of the video for "Physical".
-   "Manhunt" by Karen Kamon.
-   "Mexico Road" by K.T. Oslin is a female sex tourism song. Her songs "Younger Men", "I'll Always Come Back", "You Can't Do That" and "This Woman" are Ethical Slut songs, while "Hey Bobby", "Oo-Wee" and "Cornell Crawford" are told from a sexually aggressive woman's point of view. In fact, so many of her songs drip with sexual innuendo and bravado that a newspaper reporter once referred to her as "the Tina Turner of Country Music" as a result.
-   In The Go-Go's cover version of the Jan and Dean song of the same name, Surf City's a sausagefest:
    
    "And we go to Surf City 'cause it's two to one  
    Go to Surf City, gonna have some fun  
    Go to Surf City, 'cause it's two to one  
    Go to Surf City, gonna have some fun  
    Go to Surf City, 'cause it's two to one  
    Two boys for every girl"
    
-   In "Take Off Your Clothes" by Morningwood, the girl wants to go all the way while the guy wants to wait.
-   "Hot Stuff" by Donna Summer from _Bad Girls_, where a woman goes out and looks for some "hot stuff" tonight.
-   "So Many Men, So Little Time" by Miquel Brown.
-   "She Bangs" by Ricky Martin:
    
    "And she bangs, she bangs  
    Oh baby  
    When she moves, she moves  
    I go crazy  
    'Cause she looks like a flower but she stings  
    Like a bee  
    Like every girl in history  
    She bangs, she bangs"
    
-   Christina Aguilera is outspoken about her sexuality. The _Bionic_ and _Stripped_ albums, and within _Back To Basics_: "Nasty Naughty Boy" and "I Got Trouble" prove it. This is one of her selling points.
-   "Bitches Ain't Shit" by Dr. Dre (now with a ukulele cover by Pink Guy) puts a more negative and misogynistic spin on this trope, coupled with not-so-subtle disses towards former companions Eazy-E and Jerry Heller:
    
    "Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks  
    Lick on these nuts and suck the dick"
    
-   "Getting Lucky" by The Chipettes.
-   "Just Another Lover Tonight" by Cheryl Ladd, where a female pickup artist's out on the prowl.
-   "Good Girls" by 5 Seconds of Summer.
-   "It's Raining Men" by the Weather Girls.
-   The Debbie Gibson songs "Cougar", "Naked", "Red Hot" and "Sex".
-   ZZ Top's "Got Me Under Pressure" takes this to sick extremes.
-   "She Wolf" by Shakira references lycanthropy as a metaphor for a woman's animalistic urges.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Loads of women in Greek Mythology had a certain lustfulness about them — Aphrodite being the Ur-Example.
-   In some versions of _Jason And The Argonauts_, they come across an island populated only by women. They ask for hospitality, which is given to them in exchange for impregnating them. In one version, they are intended as a sacrifice later on, barely escaping with their lives. In this case it's arguably not so much about lust — the women had killed off the men and needed _some_ way to not die out in a few decades. Specifically, the women of the Isle of Lemnos insulted Aphrodite somehow, and were cursed with a horrible stench. Their disgusted husbands ditched them for better-smelling Thracian wives, and in revenge the Lemnian women murdered the husbands and Thracian women both. By the time the Argonauts arrived, the stench had worn off and the women were desperate for... er, children. Then a ship full of handsome, heroic Greek men pulled into harbor...
-   One of Herakles' lesser-known feats is going with Theseus (of Labyrinth and Minotaur fame) to the land of the Amazons. The queen, Hippolyta, wants to keep Theseus as a consort, and says they'll be released once Herakles deflowers/impregnates 50 Amazon women, figuring this'll get her a few days to enjoy Theseus' company. Herakles, being Herakles, does the deed in one night.
-   This is the Superhero Origin of Tiresias the Blind Seer. At an earlier point he was turned into a woman for seven years after angering Hera, during which he married and bore children. His manhood was later restored. Later, Zeus and Hera had an argument over who gets greater enjoyment from sex, women or men. Naturally, they asked the one person who'd experienced it both ways, and he told them women get ten times as much pleasure from sex as men. Angry, Hera struck him with blindness. To compensate, Zeus gave him the gift of foresight and a long lifespan.
-   Many parts of The Bible portray men and women alike as inherently sinful and vulnerable to temptation, with said temptation often being sexual in nature. Many women only appear long enough to tempt a male character or serve as examples of how the people of a specific nation have fallen into sin.
    -   Lot's daughters decided to, with their mother and husbands destroyed with Sodom, and no other avenue for having children available, get their father drunk and rape him. (Though that arguably had less to with lust and more to do with Only You Can Repopulate My Race, because they thought they were the Last of Their Kind.) The two resulting sons later become the founders of two tribes, the Moabites and Ammonites— who happened to be among the Hebrews' perennial enemies.
    -   The most pornographic passage of the bible has Israel and Judah represented as two sisters whoring around big time. God punishes them.
    -   After Joseph's brothers sell him into slavery, he winds up in Egypt, where the wife of his owner tries to seduce him because he's hot. When he turns her down, she accuses him of trying to rape her and has him thrown in prison. The fact Potipher didn't just execute Joseph outright likely shows that he knew his wife enough to realize that Joseph didn't do it and putting Joseph in prison was probably a compromise.
    -   Subverted with many of the female heroines in the Bible who are either level headed and strong willed (Deborah is one great example), faithfully married (Sarah, Priscilla, Abigail), or use their feminine charms to save people (Ruth, Rahab, Mary).
    -   In the New Testament, Jesus came into contact with the "Woman at the Well" and the "Samaritan Woman". Both women were accused of adultery, but Jesus forgave them when society didn't. The latter of which resulted in the famous "He who is without sin, cast the first stone." quote.
-   Mermaids are said to have a very seductive nature and are trying to produce more of their species. Legend states that when a mermaid is turned down on an offer of sex, she'll fly into a rage and will kill the guy who denies her pleasure.
-   During the time the Talmud (the Jewish law code) was written, the common stereotype was that women constantly want to have sex, and men constantly are trying to _avoid_ it by taking any excuse to study. There is actually a halakhah (Talmudic/Jewish law) commanding that men have to have sex with their wives once every set amount of time depending on his profession.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Sex is considered one of the three basic rights of women (not men), the other two being food and shelter, and a husband who cannot or will not provide his wife with these is called to divorce her. The only times a man is allowed to withhold sex is when his wife is considered ritually unclean, or when the man is studying Torah.

    Newspaper Comics 

-   In _Beetle Bailey_, Rolf, the civilian tennis instructor appeared in a few strips during the early eighties and he was very popular with the female characters (especially Miss Buxley). In one strip, Miss Buxley takes a private tennis lesson with him and in another, she asks General Halftrack if she could take off work early so she can take a longer one with him.
-   **All** of Brooke McEldowney's female characters.
    -   _9 Chickweed Lane_ featured a mature woman in her prime; the focus then shifted to her college-aged daughter Edda who engaged in hot, hot sex with her boyfriend Amos in front of a balloon full of Belgians with camera phones; now Edda's _grandmother_ is recounting how she met her husband while nursing a crush on a Austrian POW to her daughter, granddaughter, and her granddaughter's _ballet class_ (there's also a older female musician who tried to seduce Amos for the dramaz). _Pibgorn_ has Pib herself, who is also in passionate love with her boyfriend Geoff, and Geoff's ex-girlfriend Drucilla, who's a succubus. Notably, all the male love interests are exceedingly nerdy.
    -   In _9 Chickweed Lane,_ exactly _two_ of the male love interests are nerdy. Two. Edda's grandfather Bill was very much the Manly Man, as was Gram's other love interest, albeit in a different way, and Thorax… well, he's Thorax.

    Pinball 

-   All of the women shown in Bally's _Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy_ are depicted this way, such as the woman in the middle of the backglass who's enthusiastically grabbing the groin of a man behind her.
-   Implied in Williams Electronics' _Scared Stiff_, as Elvira's bedpost has nearly a dozen notches on it.
-   In _America's Most Haunted,_ the tombstone for Molly Fitzpatrick, ghost of the Haunted Bar, includes the quotes "Loved by Many" and "If this grave is a'rocking, don't come a'knocking."

    Print Media 

-   That's what Hugh Hefner has been saying in _Playboy_ by having either an explicit or an implicit male presence in the pictorials.
-   Despite the obvious jokes about _Playgirl_ being bought mainly by gay men, _Playgirl_ sells just as well as its Distaff Counterpart, and yes, many of its readers _are_ women.
-   Just _try_ finding an issue of _Cosmopolitan_ that _doesn't_ mention sex somewhere on the cover.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   In WWE from the Attitude Era until the PG switch, the women being sexual was treated as the default. There have been plenty of evil seductresses in WWE's time, but heroic women have still been presented as somewhat sexual. If there's ever been a non-sexual female, she's usually portrayed as an example of Sour Prudes; Molly Holly for example was a conservative prude as a heel and, while the Token Wholesome in a roster full of sexy Divas, she had still provided some tame Fanservice as a face.
-   Terri Runnels' advice column in WWE's _RAW Magazine_ was titled _Raw Sex._
-   This post from Holidead's Instagram reads:

    Theater 

-   This is basically the plot of Mozart's _Così Fan Tutte_. Fiordiligi and Dorabella are young women who love their fiances and honestly swear to be faithful, but wise old Don Alfonso knows better. They're women, they won't be able to help themselves! The boyfriends in question don't believe him, pretend to leave town and disguise themselves as passing Albanians. The women try to hold out, but within a day they succumb to the charms of the handsome "foreigners". The men, of course, would _never_ be so easily tempted. Alfonso tells them to marry the girls anyway, and not blame them: they can't help it, they're women!
-   The _Jekyll & Hyde_ show number, "Bring On The Men"
-   The comedy in _Lysistrata_ originally came from this. The women lock themselves in the city treasury and say that nobody's getting any cash or any nookie until the war between Athens and Sparta ends. The men don't take it seriously at first, and the women do, indeed, have a very difficult time with the whole "not having sex" thing (the title character had to stop a few of them from trying to sneak out to meet with their husbands), but the men end up being the ones who crack.
-   "Women's Club Blues" from _Love Life_ makes this the reason why suffragettes are so eager to put their bodies to work in the world of men.
-   In William Shakespeare's works:
    -   The eponymous hero of _Hamlet_ develops this worldview, presumably from his mother's incomprehensible preference for his Evil Uncle over his father. In Hamlet-world, the micro is always universalised, so if one morally ambiguous woman is lustful, then all women are dishonest sluts. He consequently attacks his sometime-sweetheart, Ophelia with vicious and undeserved accusations of infidelity.
        
        **Hamlet:** If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get Thee to a Nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell.
        
    -   In _Othello_, Iago convinces Othello of this to persuade him that his wife _must_ be cheating on him.
    -   This is one of the charges Lear of _King Lear_ brings against his daughters after they betray him.

    Theme Parks 

-   The wenches are chasing the pirates on the _Pirates of the Caribbean_ boat ride at both Disney Land and Disney World. This is a result of Bowdlerization. In the original versions, the men were chasing the women (presumably for You-Know-What) except for a single case where a (homely) woman was chasing one of the pirates. Now, it's all women chasing pirates, but the pirates are carrying their booty (no, not that kind) so the women are mostly interested in the goods (again, _not that kind_).

    Video Games 

-   All women in the World Union in _Culpa Innata_ are like this. All women _born_ in the World Union are like this. Immigrants from "Rogue States" still cling to "outdated" traditions and expect the man to be the initiator of a relationship and the one to buy gifts and pay for dates. In fact, this is gender-flipped in the Union for "scientific" reasons, which is a problem for both male and female immigrants. Male immigrants put off Union women with their "aggressive" approach, while female immigrants have a hard time getting themselves to ask men out (especially those from heavily patriarchal cultures). Especially since, for the most part, relationships in the Union are short and primary sex-based (marriages, or "nuptual agreements", are illegal).
-   _Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls_: Fujiko Yamada is the older sister of Hifumi Yamada from _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_. Despite her innocent appearance, she's a Yaoi Fangirl who's just as perverted as her brother.
-   In _Dante's Inferno_, the Lust demons are mostly females, as well as the damned residing in this circle. But then again, there are several other reasons to that.
-   Morrigan and Lilith in _Darkstalkers_ are very lustful succubi, willing to sleep with _anything_.
-   Leliana of _Dragon Age: Origins_ had been pointed out as a particularly aggressive romance option, indeed the actual act itself very much shows that she all but demands the Warden let her bed them regardless of race or gender. An optional encounter that results in a threesome, or a _foursome,_ ends with her wanting to go again! And unless the player is actively cruel to her then Leliana acts as if a romance is already being played out and fans had pointed out she is one of the few characters you actively have to reject as a romance rather than try and lock in for anyone else.
-   All the female squad mates in _Mass Effect 2_ admit they're sexually attracted to Commander Shepard and come onto him first. Hilariously, if you play as Female Shepard the male squad mates are too afraid to admit their feelings for her, forcing her to make the first move.
-   In _The Witcher_, the player character can sleep with 20 different women, often at the proverbial drop of the hat… and a character named "The Reverend", while leading a mob out to Burn the Witch! (carrying Torches and Pitchforks, no less!) goes on a misogynistic rant blaming women's "carnal nature" for leading mankind into sin. It's safe to say the trope is in full effect.

    Visual Novels 

-   Played with in _Double Homework_. The condition of the grant for Dr. Mosely/Zeta is for the protagonist to bed every girl in his class (minus Johanna). However, the two women conducting the experiment don’t really show sex drives. And the reason for the experiment is that young people aren’t having enough sex.
-   _Grisaia Series_: All of the girls are portrayed as having dirty thoughts on a regular basis, far moreso than the male main character, Yuuji. Amane is the most obvious example, but there are numerous discussions among the girls regarding each other's porn habits or masturbation fantasies. In nearly all cases, it's the girl who initiates sex between Yuuji and herself. It's later shown that Yuuji has had previous sexual experiences, and not all of them positive or healthy, which may explain why he's not as eager for sex as one might expect from a guy his age.
-   _Fun Bag Fantasy Series_: Every named female adheres to the Buxom Beauty Standard, with their breasts on full display. After having sex with Lute, they get very addicted to it, requesting him to bang them several times a day, which he is happy to apply. In fact, one of the main reasons why they all typically dress in Stripperific outfits is so they can be ready to have sex with Lute at any given notice.
-   Every female character in _Melody_ who gets more than a couple of scenes is shown to have a strong sex drive. Some repress it more than others do, but it's always there.

    Web Animation 

-   A large majority of the female cast from _The Most Popular Girls in School_, causing this trope to apply.

    Webcomics 

-   Most of the women in _Groovy, Kinda_ like a good tumble as often as they can get it. While Edison wants Larry and Anya, and Anya wants Larry and Edison, and Eleanor wants half the sophomore class at the local high school, Stephanie's not programmed to want anybody. Yet.
-   In the _Ciem Webcomic Series_, only Erin appears to avert this trope. All the other women are obsessed with either how to have sex, or how to blackmail someone else for getting it.
-   The females in _Sonichu_ would get it on with their "sweethearts" in public all day long if it weren't for their men being preoccupied working or fighting crime (with the notable exception of Mary Lee Walsh, the main villain). The Rosechus, in particular, seem to anxiously wait at home for their boyfriends or husbands to return so they can have sex. That being said, few of the female characters seem particularly promiscuous: Once they find a male, they will only have sex with that male. They just have sex with him very very often. The ones who ARE promiscuous, like Silvana, are evil.
-   Nearly all women in _Karin-dou 4koma_ are—to be more specific—Lovable Lustful Lesbians. There's not much to contrast them against, however, since only six males have ever appeared—and only token appearances at that.
-   Lilly of _Kimchi Cuddles_ thinks so:
    
    **Narration:** There's a stereotype that dudes will sleep with anything and women are picky… but in my experience, the opposite is closer to what's true  
    **Lilly:** _Must stop thinking about sex and pay attention to my date's boring story about train engines…_
    
-   It's a given in _The Rock Cocks_. Elizabeth seems to be a subversion until she is seen masturbating to a photo of Seth.
-   _Vampire Cheerleaders_: Lori and her Coven are considered to be the hottest girls at Bakertown High and all of them are sexually active, especially Suki.
-   In _Yumi's Cells_, Yumi's Naughty Cell occasionally causes a ruckus that the others have to deal with, especially when she's near a coworker she's attracted to. Other women like Ruby and Yunhee are shown to have active Naughty Cells as well. At one point, the reader is depicted as a woman who is too eager to see Yumi get intimate with her boyfriend, only for the reader to turn out to be Yumi's Naughty Cell.
-   The women in _Big Break (2019)_ always have sex on the brain, especially when Troy is around much to his dismay. Even when Troy isn't around, they'll always be horny for and doing it with someone else.

    Web Videos 

-   This may be due to the fact that she is often depicted as desperately in search for her soulmate, but Tess Masazza of the Italian webseries _Insopportabilmente Donna_ is shown as openly chasing men and fantasizing about having sex with them.
-   Tamara's characters on _The Nostalgia Critic_ all tend to be in love with the titular character. A lot of male characters seem to fancy him too, but she's the only woman on the show.

    Western Animation 

-   _American Dad!_ overuses this trope like there's no tomorrow. Besides our two main female characters Francine and Haley, most of the women portrayed on the show think about sex a lot. Roger even states that women are the most lustful during spring break, when he pushes Steve and Stan into having fun at his party, which is naturally proven to be true by the show's logic.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_: Poison Ivy is infamous for using her lips to kill, yet it's clear she very much enjoys the act of kissing in and of itself. In her debut episode "Pretty Poison", when Ivy locks with Batman to "seal his fate", she makes very passionate moaning sounds.
-   _The Cleveland Show_:
    -   Donna admits that she fantasizes about other men all the time whenever she has sex with her husband. Most of the time involving bad boys.
    -   Her daughter Roberta is exactly the same. Whenever she's not pushing her boyfriend into sex, she considers checking out other men.
-   _Family Guy_: Lois and Bonnie both cheated on their husbands without thinking twice. In multiple episodes, Lois even raped her husband Peter. Downplayed in that the show also uses the All Men Are Perverts trope constantly.
-   _King of the Hill_: When all the wives of the main protagonists get together they rank how sexually attractive each man in the neighborhood is. The list goes by John Redcorn, Boomhauer, Khan, Dale Gribble, and tied for last are Bill and Hank Hill. The rest of their episode revolves around Hank's wife trying to prove that her husband can be sexy.
-   _The Mask_: Eve who is the masked alter-ego of Evelyn is this considering she is flirtatious, gives Stanley Ipkiss kisses many times, gives him hard hugs and goes all too wild with him at the Coco Bongo but after accidentally putting him through the ceiling. Eve despite her insanity and wackiness genuinely feels guilty for doing it so she decides to go easy on him by giving him gentle kisses, a light hug, talking softly with him and controls her wild nature since she remembers now that Stanley is not like her.
-   Skwisgaar Skwigelf in _Metalocalypse_ tends to trigger this trope a lot. Of the five members of Dethklok, he is easily the most sexually active, and in his case, the trope is about as literal as it gets. All women...young _AND_ old...are attracted to him, and tend to get action. During a bet with Murderface, Skwisgaar estimated that he had sexual intercourse with over 400 women...and he wasn't even trying. Ironically enough, his mother tends to invoke the opposite trope.
-   _South Park_: In "Medicinal Fried Chicken", after giving himself testicular cancer Randy tells his buddies that women are into big balls. Cue Randy bouncing his inflated balls in front of multiple women complimenting on their size.
-   _Woody Woodpecker_: In the short "A Fine Feathered Frenzy" Gorgeous Gal, an overweight and elderly bird with a sexy voice takes an instant liking to Woody Woodpecker. The second she meets him she winks at him, clicks her heels in excitement and heads towards him so she can hold and kiss him. After several smooches, seduction attempts and blatant offers for the Woodpecker to make love to her, she somehow manages to get the reluctant "silly boy" to marry her. Their honeymoon on a golden submarine starts immediately after the wedding ceremony.
