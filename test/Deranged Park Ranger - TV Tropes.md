_"I didn't know park rangers carry guns. That's...unsettling."_

Park Rangers are often portrayed as either Reasonable Authority Figures, Friendly Enemies or Sitcom Archnemeses in shows featuring conservation areas/national parks or anthropomorphic animals. Their jobs incude making sure the wildlife is not fed by the visitors, ensuring litter is picked up, and overall ensuring the safety of the park and its inhabitants.

Then you have the Deranged Park Ranger—Geddit? Deranged?—who is portrayed as a psychotic, murderous, mentally unstable, or otherwise antisocial figure.

A park ranger is actually a surprisingly appropriate job for a Serial Killer, when one considers that most conservation areas/national parks are in secluded, arboreal, less than populated areas, with plenty of places to hide a body or more. Additionally, park rangers are likely to be armed to protect against wild animals, thus giving them easy access to a murder weapon. It is actually listed as one of the most common professions for serial killers alongside police officer/security guard and commercial driver.

The Deranged Park Ranger may also overlap with the Crazy Survivalist, inasmuch as they are well equipped to deal with wild animals and other survival risks, and may have chosen the job to avoid other people as much as possible.

Compare Small-Town Tyrant, when a corrupt backwoods official throws their weight around; Dirty Cop, for general police corruption; Killer Cop, when a police officer is a murderous psychopath; and Rabid Cop, when a police officer is shown to use excessive force on a regular basis.

While this can be Truth in Television, real life examples will not be permitted.

Since this is a potential Hidden Evil trope, be wary of unmarked spoilers.

-   A _Captain America_ villain, Brother Nature, was a hippie park ranger whose park was bought out by a crooked land developer and set to be razed. The ranger snuck into the park at night to sabotage the construction equipment, but the workers found him and had him Buried Alive. The dying ranger saw a vision of Gaia, who gave him power over natural forces. Becoming Brother Nature, the ranger used his new powers to destroy the construction site, but was unsatisfied and decided to retake the entire world from human civilization. Captain America arrived to stop him, and Brother Nature was so furious that Cap would oppose him that he summoned a massive earthquake. Cap survived and pointed out that the earthquake had unwittingly done what the ranger was so desperately trying to prevent - his beloved park was destroyed. Heartbroken, Brother Nature gave up after that.
