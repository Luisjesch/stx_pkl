_"Duct tape is not a perfect solution to anything. But with a little creativity, in a pinch, it's an **adequate** solution to just about everything."_

— **Jamie Hyneman**, _MythBusters_, "Duct Tape Island"

This trope is about the versatility, ubiquitousness, and downright _usefulness_ of the substance known as "duct tape". A plastic adhesive tape, usually black, grey or silver in color, originally created to seal ammunition boxes in World War II, but whose usefulness is apparent to anybody who's ever had breakage of _any_ kind that has to be temporarily held together. A military-grade version also exists, known as hundred-mile-an-hour tape in the US, which is even stronger and _more_ adhesive than duct tape, and typically comes in some shade of green or brown.

Sometimes, the universal usefulness of duct tape is paired with the universal usefulness of WD-40 lubricant, the philosophy being that duct tape is good for stopping things from moving while WD-40 is useful for the exact opposite reason. One should _never_ combine the two.

Common usages in fiction include restraining individuals and jury-rigging... well, everything.

Rather ironically, Duct Tape actually sucks at sealing ducts. It degrades and loses its stickiness over time, failing "reliably and catastrophically" when used on ducts. Aluminum tape or mastic is used instead. It is also banned by some building codes for use on ducts due to the occasional incidence of bursting into flame under high temperature.

The etymology of the word and whether it originated as "duck" tape is unclear, though the best bet is that it was first made out of a type of waterproof canvas called "duck". There _is_ a brand of duct tape called Duck Tape, but it's relatively new, and so named to deliberately capitalize on the joke. Not to be confused with Scotch Tape, although egregious use of duct tape can function as Handwavium. International names include "silver tape" in Latin America, "gum tape" (_gamu teepu_) in Japan, "roadie tape" and "Jesus tape" (because it performs miracles) in Finland, "American tape" in Spain and Italy, "Panzertape" (armor tape/tank tape) in Germany (military grade, green), and "weave tape" or "silver tape" in Sweden, blue "isolenta" ("insulation tape") in Russia.

In Britain, it can be confused with "gaffer<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  tape", a closely-related product that is more widely known in Britain — to the point where a lot of the virtues of duct tape are often spoken of by practically-minded Brits as being the virtues of gaffer tape. Gaffer tape differs from duct tape in the composition of both the backing (gaffer tape is made from fabric as opposed to vinyl or other plastics) and the adhesive (gaffer tape is easier to remove without damaging the surface to which it is adhered). As a result, "gaff" is used a lot in the entertainment industry; using duct tape on a film or theatre set where you should have used gaff _will_ get you yelled at by the crew.

Occasionally, super-glue fills this role, but more often it's used in comedic mishaps. Compare and contrast Painful Adhesive Removal.

    Advertising 

-   Flex Seal commercials run on this, showing Phil Swift destroying items, then repairing them with whatever adhesive he's advertising. Probably the most memorable example of this is in the Flex Tape commercial, which has Swift saw a small motorboat in half, then tape the two pieces back together and take the boat for a spin.

    Anime and Manga 

-   In _Battle Royale_, one character uses duct tape to _hold his intestines in_ after his stomach had been cut open.
-   In _My Hero Academia_, Hanta Sero's Quirk, Tape, allows him to create cellophane tape out of his elbows, which are shaped like tape dispensers. The tape is apparently strong enough to let him perform Building Swings, immobilize foes and catch things from afar, making this a straight case of Heart Is an Awesome Power.
-   In _Pokémon Adventures_, Looker has a huge roll of it, which he dubs as Secret Weapon No 10: Super Tight Tape. He uses it to tape Charon's mouth shut to stop his commands to Heatran before completely wrapping him up in tape to prevent him from escaping.

    Comic Books 

-   An issue of _Cable & Deadpool_ set during the _Civil War (2006)_ involved Cable, Captain America, and several others incapacitating Deadpool by cocooning him to a chair in a back alley with duct tape.

    **Deadpool:** "Man, I love duct tape. I love how it tapes. I love the sound it makes. I love saying it. Duct tape, duct tape, duct tape."
    
-   The fifth issue of _Empowered_ has two separate Duct Tape moments. First, there's the time when she lets Ocelotina interview her, only to be caught off guard and bound up with duck tape. Ocelotina finishes her big discussion on how great Duct Tape is as a bondage medium with the comment "Can you imagine using a pair of handcuffs or a ball gag to do, like, plumbing repair or whatever?". The whole thing was just a complex preparation to Emp being spanked _for underestimating duct tape_. This also helped her to use it as a Chekhov's Gun. Then later after Willie Pete blasted the space station, MindFuck's spacesuit had a big chunk torn out of it, and Emp successfully patched the big hole with Duct Tape <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In _Marvel Versus DC_, the Guardian of Space/Time (Access' predecessor) at first attempts to seal the rift between the Marvel and DC universes using duct tape. Surprisingly, this doesn't work.

-   _Millennium (1996)_. Subverted in "Somehow Satan Got Behind Me", when the demon Blurk taunts serial killer wannabe Perry that he probably has a roll of duct tape in the glove compartment of his van because he fantasies about kidnapping women and murdering them. Turns out he does.
-   Made a joke of by the _Mythbusters_, when Jamie proposed attaching microphones to the necks of actual living ducks with ...what else? Ultimately an aversion: they put velcro-strip collars on the ducks instead.
    
    -   Later they made an entire hour long episode about its many uses. Including, lifting a car, patching a leaky boat, making an _entire_ boat, sealing a potato gun, and finally _making a fully functional cannon_.
    -   They did _another_ Duct Tape hour, where they make a rope bridge out of the stuff, put a torn apart car back together (and it still works), and do the old trick of using duct tape to stick a car to a pole - the _engine_ gives out before the tape did in both experiments. However, duct tape _can't_ stop a 60 MPH car... well it _could_, if you used enough of it, but it would take a _lot_ of tape and the work of several _days_ to do it. Note that it takes them several tries to get this result, because the duct tape wall keeps holding tight but the anchoring points on the concrete weights keep ripping off. It's only once the anchors finally hold on that the wall gives way.

Oh, and an outrigger boat to escape from the island. Towards the end of the episode, Jamie basically sums the trope up with this:
    
    "We've found that duct tape is not a perfect solution for anything. But with a little creativity, in a pinch, it's an adequate solution for just about everything."
    
    -   It should be made clear that the Mythbusters did rate survival on a desert island under realistic conditions (other than the duct tape supply) to be highly plausible, mostly _because_ they resorted to duct tape in 90% of their survival situations. However, an effectively infinite supply of duct tape was assumed (approximately a whole shipped crate, if not an entire shipment), as well as a water supply like a spring or stream.
    
    -   Then they did _another_ duct tape survival hour, this time the situation being a broken-down car in the middle of the desert, and they have to traverse the Grand Canyon.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  This time, they also have a great deal of bubble wrap to help them out.

    -   An entire episode of the program was called "No Duct Tape" and focused on the Possum Lodge running out of it and Red freaking out over it. In a brief DVD commentary, Red Green poked at the writing staff (including himself) about the fact that it took them ten seasons to come up with that.
    -   One early episode contained a subversion by showing a situation when using duct tape is _not_ a good idea-Red uses Harold to show how you can use duct tape to shave your legs. Also subverted (or played for laughs, depending on how you look at it) in a later episode when Red actually _did_ need to tape two pieces of ductwork together, and spent nearly half a minute on-screen trying to figure out what he could use for this purpose before arriving at the obvious solution of _masking_ tape.

Not even Batista could break duct tape, and thus he suffered a REALLY embarrassing defeat.
    -   He could have pulled the tape off if he hadn't been busy raging while the ref counted...
    -   Alberto Del Rio beat The Big Show the same way only taping him to the bottom rope.

-   In the first _ObsCure_ game, you can attach flashlights to guns using duct tape. Strangely, this is a case where it wouldn't work in real life — it's done in-game by simply wrapping duct tape around the gun and the flashlight, including around the slide in the case of the pocket pistol, which would cause that gun to jam due to the duct tape preventing the normal operation of the slide. Even with other weapons, the recoil would likely cause the flashlight to go flying after a few shots. There's a reason why lights and other attachments are specially mounted, as is the case with the heavy pistol in-game, which comes with a built-in flashlight.

    Real Life 

-   Truth in Television, as anyone who has worked as a stagehand can attest to. Everything in a theatre is held together by either duct tape, gaffer tape, 12 gauge wire, paint, bits of string, intense prayer, or some combination of the above. Unless you're trying to take something apart, then it's held together by stripped screws and dried grease. Then again, using actual duct tape (the shinier, stickier tape) on anything other than the set is a great way to get yelled at by the Stage Manager or the technical departments, as duct tape leaves a sticky residue on cables (assuming you can get it off at all – cooking oil works best), doesn't cut or tear easily, reflects light _really_ obviously, and is easily capable of stripping paint off along with it, whereas gaffer (or gaff, or gaffa) tape is matte-colored and designed to pull away easily.
-   1972: Apollo 17: One fender on the lunar rover was damaged. The astronauts taped it back on with duct tape. Eventually, the moondust overcame the tape and the fender fell off again. This time, they jury-rigged a fender out of duct tape and four laminated maps. The map-fender lasted through 15 hours of EVA.
-   Also during _Apollo 13_, duct tape among many other items was used to adapt the "square peg" CM carbon dioxide scrubber canisters for use in the "round hole" LM scrubber socket. Ed Smylie, the man who designed the scrubber, said in a later interview that when he found out duct tape was on the space capsule, "I felt like we were home free. A southern boy will never say 'I don't think duct tape will fix it.'"
-   Hilarity ensued in 2002 when the newly-formed Department of Homeland Security advised citizens that, in the event of a chemical or biological attack on their neighborhood, they could protect themselves by sealing their doors and windows with duct tape. Lewis Black points out the flaw in this in one of his routines, stating that the only way such a thing would protect you is if you used enough of it to suffocate yourself before the chemicals killed you. The advice presumes that any chemical or biological attack committed by terrorists would be in an area small enough (on the order of a few city blocks) that the agents in question would only be around for at most a few hours before degrading to the point of ineffectiveness and be blown away by the wind. This assumption is fairly safe, taking into account the fact that the amount of chemical/biological agent needed to really cause widespread death is really only accessible to national militaries. The additional advice of canned food is only meant to be a couple days' worth that is uncontaminated by whatever struck; by that point, FEMA should have already moved in with relief work. In other words, DHS had a valid point, they just botched the delivery to the wider audience.
    -   Less funny is that one family did not get this.
    -   Sealing doors and windows with plastic and tape was, however, widely practiced in Israel during the Gulf War as a precaution against biochemical Scud missile attacks. The rationale was to limit exposure by reducing drafts, given that a one-inch gap under a door is roughly equivalent to a five-inch hole in the wall. Residents were also issued gas masks as a secondary defense and were advised that in spite of aggressive sealing, a conventional room cannot be made airtight enough to accidentally suffocate the occupants.
-   The Duct Tape Bandit. That had to hurt when they took it off. Additionally, he displays a comedic amount of Implausible Deniability.
-   Ever wonder what to do when your $200,000 stock car needs fast, fast repairs to its bodywork that you spent hours in a wind tunnel getting just right while staying within your sanctioning body's rules on body form? Huge pieces of what's essentially duct tape. Likewise "speed tape", the FAA-approved emergency aircraft repair material that's basically aluminum sheet with extremely high-grade adhesive backing.
-   Scientists wearing hazard suits will often keep pre-cut lengths of duct tape on their legs and arms in order to make a quick patch job in an emergency.
-   Ever seen a picture of "the gadget" (the implosion-type plutonium fission device used in the first nuclear weapons test)? The device — it could not properly be called a "bomb," since it could in no way be used as a weapon of war — was held together with, among other things... you guessed it.
-   There exists an entire online community devoted to duct tape fashion; including clothing, accessories, and jewelry made predominantly or entirely out of various colors of the stuff. Most commonly including:
    -   Prom dresses. Apparently, this is a common event, as one school has a yearly scholarship for the best duct tape dress.
    -   Tuxedos, too.
    -   Corsets and bondage gear made mainly out of, or at least covered by, duct tape is commonly seen in Goth/Industrial nightclubs, and are a staple of fetish fashion.
    -   Wallets and purses. You can buy these pre-made or easily download instructions on making your own.
    -   Some have used duct tape to make _cosplays_. It is also great to make custom foam weapons (when combined with foam, obviously) for Live-Action Roleplay. Similarly, many Society for Creative Anachronism rattan swords are covered with duct tape for a somewhat-metallic finish.
-   Silk tape (Durapore in the US), which has a fairly heavy fabric base and much stronger adhesive than paper or plastic tapes, is the healthcare professional's answer to duct tape, with the added bonus of being nontoxic and hypo-allergenic. Go to any hospital and it's guaranteed you'll see at least one IV pole, vital-signs monitor, or bed control that's been "repaired" with carefully applied silk tape.
-   NASA's policy for if someone goes crazy in a shuttle is to have them Bound and Gagged with duct tape. The Associated Press gave a report on 2/23/07 about the NASA documents with written procedures which involve "duct tape around the wrists and ankles, tying them down with a bungee cord and injecting with tranquilizers as necessary". Similarly, when engineers came up with a system for doing CPR in space involving harnesses and what have you, astronauts balked, said it was too complicated and that they could do it with duct tape.
-   The US military has a stronger version called "100 mph" or "high speed" tape; both because it's said to be able to hold a part on a Jeep at 100 mph,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and because "high speed" is Army slang for excellence. Army duct tape is typically olive drab or medium brown in color instead of silver, for obvious reasons.
-   Possibly related to the above, submariners are quite familiar with duct tape on steroids called "EB Green", so named for its supposed origin with Electric Boat, who built a lot of US submarines. A probably apocryphal accounts credit it with withstanding pressures to test depth, in excess of 400 feet (the "official" test depth stated to the public by the US Navy, for security reasons). The story goes that this occurred on a boat during testing following a refit at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, a facility somewhat notorious for absurd incidents that damaged boats or led to them being damaged later in stupid ways (poor communications led to USS Guitarro sinking during construction and the same boat was fitted with a defective propeller shaft that snapped in mid-ocean due to a procedural error). One part of post-refit inspection involved taking the boat to a specified depth (400 feet in this case) and then doing the most thorough possible inspection for any possible leaks. During the inspection, any crewman may order an emergency surfacing if a problem is detected. One crewman stuck his head through a hatch into the space between the ship's interior compartments and the pressure hull and began screaming for an emergency surface. Afterwards, when asked what he'd found, he said they wouldn't believe him unless the senior officers looked themselves, and what they saw was a chunk of the pressure hull missing and taped over with EB Green. It turned out that a hole had been cut in the pressure hull to access components inside for work in the refit, and it began to rain so the workman taped over the hole to keep out water, and before he got back to it the whole thing was painted over.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  The gloves on anti-contamination (Canary) suits, for entering the Reactor Compartment during shutdowns, were sealed to the suits using the same EB Green.
-   Duct tape is featured regularly in submissions to There, I fixed it, including to repair an aircraft fuselage that had been mauled by a bear. As stated in the Live-Action Television section, this was confirmed by Mythbusters.
-   After _There, I Fixed It_ posted an authentic photo of the Apollo 13 air-scrubber rig, the site received a submission from the International Space Station. Duct tape has been, and likely will always be, standard issue on all space missions.
-   A hole in your drum? A piece of your guitar get chipped off? There's a reason why duct tape is commonly called the (amateur) musician's best friend. It's a friend to a professional musician as well: Eddie Van Halen has a strip of duct-tape rolled into a tube, flattened and stuck to his guitar to hold picks. Kurt Cobain once used duct tape to hold the tuning keys in place while he recorded a song with a cheap guitar. The song in question was "Polly," and that's the version used on _Nevermind_. Ricky Wilson of The B-52s sometimes used a duct tape guitar strap.
-   Fun fact: there exists _nuclear-grade_ duct tape in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and slate blue. And that's not hyperbole — the technical data sheet advertises compliance with ASME NQA-1, the 2008 standard for nuclear technology. It's not even all that expensive.
-   During the first _Star Wars_ film, _A New Hope_, duct tape was used to hold Carrie Fisher's boobs in place, because George Lucas had a "no bras in space" rule, and the white see-through dress she wore throughout _A New Hope_ would make a bra too obvious.
-   Like all things, duct tape can be used for malignant purposes. For example, a cat that was wrapped neck to tail in tape. Anyone who would do this to such an adorable creature must be on the dark side of the duct-tape force. Or trying to give the cat a worming pill.
-   _The Darwin Awards_ have a few entries related to people who overestimated duct tape:
-   _Consumer Reports_' solution to the iPhone 4 reception problem? Cover the antenna area of the outside case with "thick non-conductive material". Guess which one they used in the demonstration video?
-   For rescue and EMS, there's a disposable head immobilizer which is essentially two styrofoam logs with duct tape to fasten the patient's head to the backboard, seen here.
-   It's even been used to fix aircraft engines (#6, 4th photo) and wings.
-   The frequently cited usage of duct tape as an improvised dressing is generally a bad idea, though. The sticky surface of the tape typically harbors large amounts of harmful bacteria and the water-resistant surface of the tape prevents wounds from draining. Lastly, when the tape is removed, it's likely to also remove much of the scab and healing skin. It's far better used as a bandage to keep a proper dressing like gauze or sterilized cloth in place over the injury.
-   Duct tape makes for _awesome_ splinting material. If you get two nice straight sticks, you can use duct tape to immobilize the limb beautifully. Just the duct tape alone wrapped a sufficient number of times, can be used to immobilize a joint if you don't have a splint handy.
-   On that note: An old tale among family physicians concerns a patient who came in with warts. The surgeon wants to excise them with some newfangled technique costing thousands; another specialist wants to freeze them off, costing hundreds; the family physician says, "Put duct tape on warts for a week, then take it off. You'll be fine." A scientific study showed that Duct Tape really does cure warts with 85% efficiency!
-   Its usage has even made it to philosophy: just like Occam's Razor is the principle that says you should make as few assumptions as possible when solving a problem, _Occam's duct tape_ is a logical fallacy in which someone makes a ridiculously huge number of assumptions when approaching a problem or discussing something.
-   There is a meme, "Silence is golden. Duct tape is silver."
-   Subverted when Dhani Harrison once wrecked his car when speeding down the driveway. He put the parts back together with Duct Tape. When his mom found out, she flipped out.
-   If you have to hold something metallic between your teeth, it's not a bad idea to wrap the part you're biting down on with duct tape to cushion the bite and prevent damage to your chompers (or dentures). It's a trick commonly used by handymen that use small flashlights instead of headlamps to work in tight spaces.
