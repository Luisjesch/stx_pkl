Released in 1994, and to date, the fourth most financially successful film in the Disney Animated Canon<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ; and its 32nd entry.

_The Lion King_ tells the story of a lion cub named Simba, heir to the throne of Pride Lands. Simba is tricked by his jealous uncle, Scar, into believing he set into motion the events that led to the death of his father, King Mufasa. Simba flees the Pride Lands in shame, but is saved from certain death in the wastelands by two wisecracking animals who raise Simba under their responsibility-free philosophy of "Hakuna Matata" ("no worries"). However, when Simba meets his childhood friend Nala years later, he must decide whether to continue his carefree existence or return to the dying Pride Lands and reclaim his throne from Scar's treacherous and iron-pawed rule.

A plot described by some as _Hamlet_, _Macbeth_, debatably _The Epic Of Sundiata_ from Mali, with a few hints of _Henry IV_, but with animals. The sequels seem to follow the Shakespearean trend, as _The Lion King II: Simba's Pride_ is _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Macbeth_ With Nearly Normal Animals In Africa, and _The Lion King 1 ½_ resembles _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead_ (a Perspective Flip of _Hamlet_, written in The '60s).

The original film's success led to a massive franchise that includes two TV series, a video game for Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo, and the third-longest running and _the_ highest-grossing Broadway musical of all time. It remains one of Disney's biggest animated cash cows to this day; in 2011, _The Lion King_ received a re-release in Disney Digital 3D, which became the first re-release of a movie since the 1997 re-release of _Return of the Jedi_ to hit number one at the box office.

One of the approximately 40 foreign dubs of this movie was in Zulu, and it remains the only Disney movie to ever have been dubbed in an African language.

In mid-late 2016, hot off the success of their live-action/CGI hybrid remake of _The Jungle Book_, Disney and Jon Favreau announced a photorealistic CGI remake of _The Lion King_, released on July 19, 2019. That film has since become the highest-grossing animated film of all time, proving the reigning popularity of this franchise.
