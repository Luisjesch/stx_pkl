_"Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight  
It must have been something you said"_

Death Is Dramatic, depressing, and emotional enough, but sometimes, just for the extra emotional kick-in-the-gut Tear Jerker, the author will make a character die in the arms of a helpless onlooker. As the onlooker (usually one of the dying character's True Companions) holds them dearly, the dying may flash them a smile or make a final dramatic statement before finally closing their eyes and succumbing to their fate.

If this is done on an Anyone Can Die show, expect the character to be Killed Off for Real (usually). Can turn into It's Personal for the witness, and very often overlaps with How Dare You Die on Me! and Dying Declaration of Love. May be an extension of the refusal to let your loved one Die Alone.

Compare with Pietà Plagiarism, the pose characters generally find themselves in, Cradling Your Kill, when a character dies in their killer's arms, and Deadly Hug, where the victim is killed _during_ the embrace. Contrast Intimate Healing, where a wounded or ill character is _less likely_ to die while in a loved one's arms. At least, not _literally_. (Though strangely enough, _intimacy_ is exactly what's being referenced by the Cutting Crew song.) May overlap with Cradle of Loneliness, especially if the body of a loved one is cradled long after their death.

This is a Death Trope, so be warned that **UNMARKED SPOILERS** abound.

## Examples:

-   Live-Action TV

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Perhaps the most tear-jerking of them all is Misuzu dying in Haruko's arms in _AIR_. The kicker? It plays to the most heart-wrenching award bait song EVER.
-   In the anime version of _Akame ga Kill!_, Mine is not given the Plot Armor her manga counterpart was given, and proceeds to die in Tatsumi's arms after sacrificing her Imperial Arm to kill Great General Budo, who had fatally wounded her earlier in the fight. She manages to deliver a Dying Declaration of Love and a First Kiss slash Last Kiss to the man she was starting to crush on before letting death take her. All set to the short, yet somber cello of Yume Monogatari.
-   In _Angel Beats!_, Kanade Tachibana aka Angel finally manages to pass on in Otonashi's arms.
-   In _Arata: The Legend_, Akachi dies in Kannagi's arms after the former submits to him, complete with Kannagi not letting go of Akachi until Homura's flames have completely burned Akachi's body away.
-   In _Battle Royale_:
    -   Yutaka is shot by Kiriyama while he's in Mimura's arms during their emotional embrace after Shinji accidentally shot Keita.
    -   Earlier, Takako dies in Sugimura's arms, who had been trying to find her the entire time.
-   _Berserk_:
    -   Judeau dies in Casca's arms (sort of) after shielding her from a demon attack during the Eclipse. Made even worse by two additional heart-wrenching factors: his love was unrequited, and _she didn't even know how he felt_. Worse, in the manga, the poor guy doesn't even succeed in spitting it out before he dies.
    -   Gaston, Guts' second in command, dies in his arms and is the last of the Hawks to die. He didn't go out as kindly as Judeau did, though.
-   In _Black Cat_, Saya died in Train's arms.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   When Hisana is bedridden with sickness, Byakuya is at her bedside clinging to her hand as she dies.
    -   After failing to defeat Aizen to obtain revenge for something Aizen did to his Childhood Friend Rangiku, Gin dies with Rangiku almost sprawled over his broken body, crying helplessly.
-   In _Bokurano_, Anko dies in either Kanji's arms or her dad's, depending if you're following the anime or the manga.
-   In the anime of _Case Closed_, Ai's older sister Akemi Miyano bleeds to death in the arms of Conan Edogawa himself. And much later, we find out that decades ago, Matsumoto's partner Morimura died in Matsumoto's arms.
-   In the manga version of _Chrono Crusade_, Rosette does this in Chrono's arms. _Twice_.
-   _CLANNAD_: Ushio, the daughter of Tomoya and the already deceased Nagisa dies in Tomoya's arms from the same illness that took her mother’s life.
-   _Code Geass_:
    -   Shirley is in Lelouch's arms when she dies from being shot by Rolo.
    -   Rolo also died in Lelouch's arms after a Heroic Sacrifice to save him from the Black Knights' betrayal.
    -   And then there's Lelouch, who was in Suzaku's arms for a while, but died in Nunnally's in the end.
    -   Also, Euphemia in Suzaku's arms, Marianne in Nunnally's arms in the past, and C.C. in Lelouch's arms in the beginning, though she recovered.
-   The climax of _Count Cain_ takes this and applies Rule of Three: First, Jizabel Disraeli, already dying of a gunshot wound, slits his throat in Cassian's arms; second, Alexis succumbs to poison while being cradled by his dragon, Ida, and finally Cain refuses to save himself alone, preferring to be crushed by rubble to stay alongside Riff.
-   Julia dies in Spike's arms in the last episode of _Cowboy Bebop_, "The Real Folk Blues (Part 2)". Her death scene is iconic as well as heartbreaking (until Julia was made to sing "(I Just) Died in Your Arms Tonight" in one of the AMV Hell compilations).
-   _Cross Ange_: Right in the Downer Beginning, Empress Sophia dies in the arms of her daughter Angelise, after she takes the bullet for her.
-   The ending of _The Dagger of Kamui_ features, among other things, the death of Oyuki, who eventually dies in Jiro's arms after making a last stand against Tenkai, her caregiver-turned-enemy.
-   L in Light's in _Death Note_, although Light cradling L in his arms as he dies is actually just an act; when Light thinks nobody but L can see his face, he flashes a smugly victorious Slasher Smile at L just before L expires.
-   Near the end of the Vamdemon arc of _Digimon Adventure_, Wizardmon died in Gatomon's arms after Taking the Bullet for her and Hikari. Then we have Wormmon in _Digimon Adventure 02_, who died in Ken's arms to kick-start his Heel–Face Turn. Wormmon got better... Wizardmon didn't.
-   In the _Dragon Ball Z_ special, _Bardock - The Father of Goku_, Bardock finds his entire team dead save for Tora, whom he picks up and is told by him that Freeza is afraid of him and plans to kill the entire saiyan race. He shortly died in Bardock's arms afterward.
    -   Lampshaded in the TFS abridged parody.
        
        **Bardock:** My best friend just died in my arms. Didn't he?
        
-   Alfeegi in Dragon Knights dies in his friend's arms after he was stabbed by the main character, who later cut off his own head.

    -   Lucy holds her Bad Future counterpart in her arms after the latter throws herself in front of an attack meant for her.
-   Happens several times in _Fate/Apocrypha_:
    -   Achilles cradles Atalanta in his arms after he stabs her through the stomach to save her from her own madness, while he himself is dying from her arrows rammed through his back. They exchange tearful thanks and farewells before passing on, though the former lasts a little longer. Should it be mentioned that William Shakespeare (who was no stranger to this trope in Real Life) was a member of their team and offered to write a tragic story of unrequited love between them earlier in the series?
    -   Sieg holds Jeanne in his arms as she's dying after the use of her La Pucelle to try and destroy the Holy Grail. In a twist, only Jeanne herself dies, while her host body Laetica remains in his arms unconscious, but alive.
    -   Shirou Kotomine ultimately dies in the lap of his Servant Semiramis after he's fatally injured, being comforted by her as he passes away and even sharing a kiss.
-   Though it's not shown in the final version, in an early script of _Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa_ Izumi died in Wrath's arms, complete with going out with a smile.
-   Nuriko of _Fushigi Yuugi_ dies in Tamahome's arms, as does Tamahome's little sister Yuiren. Soi dies in Nakago's.
    -   In the _Suzaku Hi Den_ novel and third OVA, Shu Tendo dies in _both_ Hotohori and You Houki's arms after Hotohori tells him they can fix the Konan nation.
-   _Fushigi Yuugi: Genbu Kaiden_ has Takiko Going Out With A Smile in Uruki's arms, after summoning Genbu and being killed by her father to prevent her from being devoured by Genbu.
-   In _Future War 198X_ Michael frantically searches for Marina after a fight breaks out in Neinberg, only to find her crushed under the rubble of a building. He pulls her out and she dies in his arms.
-   Another instance of this trope occurs in _Gantz_, where the protagonist's girlfriend Tae Kojima dies in his arms after being hunted down and murdered.
-   In the _Ginga Densetsu Weed_ manga, Weed's oldest friend GB who's been a coward all his life finally finds his courage when they're fighting a giant hybrid bear and ferociously attacks it, only to suffer fatal wounds in the attempt. Upon dying, GB cries and asks Weed to hug him, and (as much as it's possible for a dog to hug someone) Weed concedes while crying heavily himself, and he keeps holding onto him until GB suffers death cramps and dies completely.
-   Hare, while being eaten alive by the Apocalypse Virus, dies this way in _Guilty Crown_. Averted, she was already dead, but her body shattered in Shu's arms.
-   In _Gungrave_ Episode 24, Sherry ended up taking a bullet meant for Harry when he was attacked by an assassin. Harry screamed her name while he clutched her to his chest.
-   Pip Bernadotte in Seras' in _Hellsing_. Though technically he was just absorbed.
-   In _Hello World_ Ruri is held by Naomi after the lightning strike that felled her. It is later revealed that this is downplayed as Ruri was only struck into a coma, but the depiction of Naomi otherwise conforms to this.
-   _Hunter × Hunter_: Meruem beautifully dies in Komugi's arms after he converses with her until his last breath, asking if she was there with him. Komugi dies soon after..
-   In _Inuyasha_, Kikyou dies in the title character's arms for the final time, after a Last Kiss.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   Played straight early in _Phantom Blood_, when George Joestar, Jonathan's father, dies in his arms after being stabbed by Dio. Later Inverted during the ending, where Jonathan Joestar dies while holding Dio Brando's severed, but quite alive, head in his arms.
    -   _Stone Ocean_: Pucci's sister threw herself off a cliff into a lake. After he found out she died, he runs through the lake over to her lifeless body and cradles her in his arms, mournfully screaming to the heavens that he wants his life to be taken instead of hers.
-   Happens twice in _K_. In the flashback in Episode 6, Totsuka dies in Yata's arms after being shot, and later Mikoto dies while slumped into Munakata's arms.
-   In _Kaze no Stigma_, Ayumi dies in Ren's arms.
-   _Knight Hunters_ gets some mileage out of this one: Aya gets to both Asami and Sena _just_ in time for this, Sister Ruth dies in the arms of both Ken _and_ Omi, Nagi catches Tot as Fafarello stabs her (she recovers) and has a nice Freak Out, and, most dramatically of all, Ouka Sakaki is shot as Omi embraces her, telling her they'll always be together...
-   In the first episode of _Kotetsu Jeeg_, Dr. Shiba arrives home gravely wounded after Queen Himika tried to silence him. He ends up dying in the arms of his estranged son Hiroshi, The Hero and the titular Jeeg.
-   The movie adaptations of _Macross Delta_ have this happen, once per film:
    -   In _Passionate Walkure_, Messer meets his ends in Kaname's arms, rather than being killed by a shot through the cockpit by Keith.
    -   In _Absolute Live_, Freyja dies in Hayate's arms after she sings to help Delta Flight and Walkure defeat Heimdall.
-   Dream!Alicia Disappeared into Light during her Final First Hug with Fate in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's_, all while telling her how she wished she could have been her sister in real life.
-   _Gundam_
    -   In _Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam_, both Four and Emma die in the arms of Kamille. Whereas Blex Forer dies in Quattro's.
    -   Happens twice in _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_: when Gentle Chapman loses to Domon and collapses, he dies in his wife's arms (though he Comes Back Wrong later), while Master Asia dies in Domon's arms after their final battle.
    -   In _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing Episode Zero_, Wufei's wife Meiran dies in his arms after she tried to save her space colony.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny_ has two of these instances:
        -   Stella Loussier was in the middle of being calmed down by Shinn Asuka in the Impulse Gundam after going on a rampage with the massive Destroy Gundam... until seeing the Freedom Gundam of Kira Yamato made her Freak Out. Shinn tried to calm her down again, but she was ultimately beyond reason and would have killed Shinn had not Kira swooped in and violently destroyed the Destroy. Shinn found Stella amidst the wreckage, mortally wounded, and cradled her as she died professing her love for him. Shinn... did not take it well.
        -   Meer Campbell dies in the hands of Lacus Clyne after Taking the Bullet for her. For an extra kick, Meer is Lacus' Body Double and her once biggest fangirl, now ridden by a volatile mix of jealousy, admiration, and the wish to be noticed by her.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Sasuke appears to die in Naruto's arms in the very first arc, after stands in front of about twenty senbon heading for Naruto. Since Haku's attacks weren't intended to be fatal, he lives.
    -   During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Neji really does die in Naruto's arms.

-   In _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, Emily Sevensheep dies (or better said, was _written out of reality_) in the arms of Yue Ayase.
-   In _One Piece_:
    -   Ace shields Luffy from a killing blow, and he dies while Luffy holds him in his arms. This trope contributes to the sheer emotional impact this death has on both Luffy and the viewer.
    -   In a flashback of the Dressrosa arc, Scarlett died in her husband Kyros' arms. This one is especially cruel since Kyros had been turned into a Living Toy by Sugar, everyone had forgotten about him, which means Scarlett died not even remembering she had a husband, let alone knowing he was holding her. And Kyros _couldn't even feel the warmth of her dying body_. _Holy crap_.
-   Xerxes Break dies in the arms of the two people he loves: Sharon and Reim in _PandoraHearts_.
-   In _Parasyte_, Shinichi holds Kana this way, on the night she intended to declare her love to him. Her eagerness to rush to this confession led her to run straight into a parasyte he was too late to save her from. As an unrequited love interest, this was sadly the closest she'd get to him.
-   Two examples in _Phantom Dream_:
    -   Early on in the series, Kaname dies in Tamaki’s arms after the Suigekka sword has been recovered by Eiji, leaving Tamaki alone with only the higoshi to aid him.
    -   After Roka realizes that Hira is starting to lose himself to his hatred, she kills herself rather than let Mutsu be forced to kill her and she dies with him holding her in his arms.
-   _Red Baron_: Subverted and Played for Laughs in Episode 31. A beaten up Marilyn approaches Komei to tell him what she discovered about the Gold Baron, and acts like she's happy to die in Komei's arms. Then Asimov wakes her up and she gets pretty angry about it, showing that she wasn't actually dying.
-   Romeo dies in Juliet's arms, in _Romeo × Juliet_, after being Impaled with Extreme Prejudice.
    -   Technically, in the manga they die at the same time.
    -   Same goes to Lord Montague, who perishes in the arms of _both_ Romeo and Juliet.
-   Happens in _Rozen Maiden_ on two separate occasions. First, Souseiseki dies in Suiseiseki's hands after a futile attempt at taking on Suigintou, made especially heartwrenching because Suiseiseki had desperately tried to convince her not to do it up to that point. In the very next episode, Hinaichigo slowly unwinds during the course of the episode and finally in the hands of Tomoe.
-   In _Rurouni Kenshin_, Tomoe died in Kenshin's arms after he accidentally attacked her with his katana. In the OVA, this is when she decides to add the other stroke of his cross-scar (in the original, the scar happened accidentally).
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   Sailor Mars dies in Sailor Moon's arms in the climax of _Sailor Stars_.
    -   Prince Diamond dies in Sailor Moon's arms as well.
    -   Mamoru, in his first death.
    -   Nephrite and Blue Saphir, whose Redemption Equals Death demises happen while in Naru's and both Moon and Tuxedo Kamen's arms, respectively.
    -   Kakyuu dies in the arms of the three Starlights. In the manga, it was Kakyuu in the arms of Sailor Moon.
    -   Zoisite in Kunzite's arms.
-   In the final episode of _School-Live!_ Team Pet Taroumaru died in Miki's lap. He had turned into a zombie and was given an anti-zombie vaccine. However it was too late and he died quickly after getting the vaccine, though at least he didn't die a zombie puppy.
-   In _S Cryed_, Ayase dies in Kazuma's arms when she loses the will to live. It sounds a bit idiotic, but it's justified in that being refined weakened her body severely, so the only thing she was living for was her brother. When he died, that was it.
-   In _Snow White with the Red Hair_ prince Zen's first friend, an archer near his age working at the castle, died in his arms after revealing himself as a False Friend that was part of a plot to assassinate Zen in retaliation for the way his elder brother had removed an earl and his family from power.
-   In the _Soul Eater_ anime, Crona appears to die in Maka's arms. Zhe gets better.
-   In Episode 14 of _Sword Art Online_, Asuna does this to Kirito after taking an attack meant for him. Thankfully, Kayaba put her in the waiting room rather than having her brain fried immediately, so when Kirito won the game a minute or so later, she was able to survive. Also in the last chapter of the second season of the anime Yuuki dies peacefully in Asuna's arms.
-   In _Tiger & Bunny_, the end of Episode 24 has a scene that looks like a classic example (which all the characters believed it to be), but this was subverted as of ep. 25.
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul:Re_, the blood flows freely.
    -   Shirazu is mortally wounded saving his squad from Noro and ends up bleeding to death. After spending the entire series manipulating and plotting against him, Urie is the one that ends up comforting Shirazu in his final moments. Afterwards, he stays with the body and refuses to let go until medics come to retrieve it.
    -   At the conclusion of their climatic battle, Arima commits suicide and dies in Kaneki's arms, confessing his many secrets. The chapter ends with a shot of Kaneki cradling his body in his arms, screaming in grief.
-   _Tokyo Ravens_: Twice, Harutora cradles Hokuto and later Natsume as they make their Dying Declaration of Love.
-   _The Twelve Kingdoms_: Seishuu dies in Youko's arms, and Ikuya Asano perishes in Shoukei's.
-   _Vampire Knight_: Shizuka dies in Ichiru's.
    -   Later Ichiru dies in Zero's.
    -   Sara dies in Takuma's.
    -   Kaname at last dies/falls into coma in Yuuki's.
-   _X/1999_:
    -   Seishirou dies in Subaru's arms at the Rainbow Bridge. Made all the more ironic since we also learn that when Seishirou killed Subaru's twin Hokuto... she died in his arms as well. (There was a famous _Tokyo Babylon_ picture featuring that moment already, but only then we see the details.)
    -   Potentially subverted when Kotori is killed, and once everything has died down, Kamui cradles _her severed head_ while the Seals look on in horror and sadness. It's played straight in the anime series, however, since she still dies but doesn't get dismembered, letting Kamui hold her entire body — and later, Karen dies in Aoki's arms, while Hinoto dies in Kamui's and later Sorata perishes in Arashi's.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ **LOVES** this trope:
    -   _Yu-Gi-Oh_ Season 4: Joey dies in Mai's arms (it turns out to be of the undoable kind).
    -   _Yu-Gi-Oh_ Season 5: Kisara dies in Priest Seto's arms.
    -   _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_:
        -   Carly dies in Jack's arms (undone at the end of the season).
        -   Kiryu dies in Yusei's arms, complete with Ho Yay shoujo sparkles.
    -   _Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS_: Ai dies in Yusaku's arms while confessing his love.

    Comic Books 

-   Comic book covers in general, especially in the Silver Age and the Bronze Age, absolutely loved this trope. Almost always accompanied by a Tonight, Someone Dies.
-   While he was technically already dead, Jason Todd (Robin II) was held in the arms of Batman during _A Death in the Family_.
-   Elektra had her first death in _Daredevil_. After taking a vicious curbstomping from Bullseye that ends in her throat getting slashed by a thrown card and then her getting impaled on her own sai, Elektra crawls out from the parking lot they were fighting in. She stays alive long enough to crawl to Matt's house and call out to him, before dying in his arms.
-   _Green Lantern_ Alan Scott's friend (and secret lover) Jimmy Henton died in the same act of sabotage that led to Alan becoming the Green Lantern. In the Golden Age the first thing Alan did after regaining consciousness was to stumble over and cradle his body, and in the DC Rebirth era Alan actually got to Jimmy before he died and they exchanged a few words before he died in Alan's arms.

-   Troia died in Nightwing's arms in _Graduation Day_. As they were each other's closest friends and Like Brother and Sister, it really messed him up.
-   In the Belgian comic _Papyrus_, the issue _Tears of the Giants_ finishes with Papyrus cradling and later carrying the lifeless body of a Hitite princess who loved him but couldn't spit it out since she was to marry the Pharaoh aka Papyrus's boss, and could only tell him as she lay dying in his arms.
-   Happens twice in _Runaways_. To the same person. Both times are with the same guy, too.

-   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: After being fatally wounded by the White Magician and forcing Diana to take the item keeping her alive so that Diana can win the fight Artemis takes her last breaths being cradled by Diana.

Hamlet's mother had already died because she drank from a poisoned cup that the king had meant for Hamlet. Anyways, everyone's pretty much dead except Hamlet, Horatio, and Osric by this point. Hamlet lies dying in Horatio's arms, telling Horatio to live and "report \[him\] and \[his\] cause aright to the unsatisfied." Horatio offers to die with Hamlet by drinking from the poisoned cup, but Hamlet tells him to continue living "to tell \[his\] story."

    -   _Kingdom Hearts_ almost did this when Kairi is revived and Sora has stabbed himself with the Keyblade of People's Hearts. Sora falls backwards, Kairi goes to catch him, and...he disappears, sparkling out of existence. Yes, folks, this is when Roxas was born.
    -   In _Kingdom Hearts III_ Saix dies in Lea's arms after being defeated by Sora, Roxas and Xion. As both are aware of the temporary nature of "death" for Nobodies, they promise to meet up again once Saix — Isa — returns to life as a human.

        -   Miranda will die this way if you don't complete certain prerequisites.

The elder Swaine has just had to watch his younger self run away from home, fully believing his father only loves his younger brother. The elder only realizes how wrong this is as he embraces his father one last time. This naturally leads to a hugely, giganticly, screen-shaking "NOOO!"
-   Done twice in Hikari's first chapter in _Octopath Traveler II_. Tsuki and King Jigo both die in Hikari's arms after Mugen's attack on the city and castle.

Also, at the very end of the game, during graduation day, a weary protagonist, having used all of his (or her, if the player chooses a female protagonist for the Playstation Portable version of the game) power to seal away the harbinger of death, falls asleep and dies in Aigis' arms.
        -   As an another addition, _Persona 3 Portable_'s ending on a New Game Plus gives the protagonist the choice to meet whomever he/she maxed a Social Link with romantically to die in their arms. For the female protagonist, this includes Shinjiro Aragaki, who merely woke up from a coma three days before.
        -   Many are Anguished Declaration of Love and Declaration of Protection. Ken has Please, Don't Leave Me (well, he's been "left behind" before), Akihiko's is a straight up love declaration, and Shinjiro is still as upbeat as always: "I'm glad I met you."
        -   Chidori romantically dies in Junpei's arms after performing a Heroic Sacrifice to save him from dying of a bullet wound by infusing him with her Persona's power. In P3 FES, she can get better if the player fulfilled certain requirements before the scene.

        -   Phi and Sigma will die hugging each other if you fail to defuse the bombs.
    -   _Zero Time Dilemma_:
        -   Sigma in Diana's arms in the ending where Diana didn't push the blue button.
        -   Inverted in Monty Hall segment if you get the answer right. While the room is filled with carbon dioxyde you'll get a gas mask but only one. Junpei will give it to already nearly passed out Akane and she'll be held in his arms while _he_ dies. Getting the wrong answer leads to straighter example, except they _both_ die.

    **Maul**: He... will... avenge us.
    
    -   A darker and straighter version involving the same characters occurs in _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_. Maul kills Duchess Satine, who dies in Obi-Wan's arms in an obvious Shout-Out to _Moulin Rouge!_.
-   _ThunderCats (2011)_ has The Hero Lion-O doing this twice:
    -   In "Omens Part Two" he holds his father King Claudus as he dies having been stabbed In the Back by the series Big Bad, and Claudus has just enough time to tell Lion-O he's So Proud of You.
    -   In "Song of the Petalars" Lion-O holds his Lilliputian Plant Person friend Emrick in the palms of his hands, as Emrick dies of old age, due to his race's one-day lifespan. Lion-O grieves that Emrick hasn't achieved all his goals, but Emrick, who by his reckoning has led a rich, fulll lifetime, assures him that It's the Journey That Counts.
-   In _Wakfu_, Idiot Hero Sadlygrove dies in the arms of his Love Interest, Evangelyne. Luckily, he gets better and returns early into the following season.
-   Yakko Warner cradles his sister Dot as she dies near the end of _Wakko's Wish_, breaking down in tears as she makes him tell her special story "one last time." We see later she, and arguably he, were just acting but it's no less heartbreaking to watch.
-   The first Bugs Bunny cartoon, _A Wild Hare_, has Bugs stage a fake death scene in Elmer's arms.
