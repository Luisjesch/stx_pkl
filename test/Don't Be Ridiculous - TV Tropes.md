**Darlene Spritzer**: What do I look like to you, some kind of used appliance?

**Sunny Jim**: Don't be ridiculous! An appliance comes with an off-switch.

"... dogs come from the _Moon_, not the Sun!"

Alice says something ridiculous. Bob responds with this Stock Phrase (or some close relative), then explains _why_ Alice's statement is ridiculous. Of course, Bob's justification is either as absurd, more absurd, or otherwise not a rebuttal one would normally make to the original statement.

Often, Bob is The Ditz, a Cloudcuckoolander, or a Bunny-Ears Lawyer. Less often, Alice is likewise one of those characters.

A common variant is that Alice's original statement was an attempt to guess what Bob is planning or doing. ("So you're going to just storm the castle?" "Don't be absurd. I'm going to storm the castle _carrying this marionette._ Sheesh.")

Not quite the same as the usage of the phrase by Funny Foreigner Balki Bartokomous in the sitcom _Perfect Strangers_. (He would say it when suspected of doing something wrong, but usually wouldn't follow up with a nonsensical rebuttal.)

See Insane Troll Logic. Somewhat related to Voodoo Shark (when Real Life fiction-creators are seen doing this themselves — albeit not in response to a theory they find absurd). May also involve Distinction Without a Difference ("No, I'm not eating an eraser. I'm eating _two_ erasers"). Compare Worrying for the Wrong Reason ("Sharks? Don't be silly. The crocodiles will get you first").

    "From the Rhymer?" He leaned forward and lifted his eyebrows in mock wonderment. "How could that be? ... I have the story from the boy, of course. The Rhymer's son.  
    "Beautiful boy," he added, after a moment. "Resembled his mother."

    -   Later on, on several occasions, Jim (who plays Qui-Gon) would suggest Summon Bigger Fish as a solution to the various problems they were facing. The DM would always have an objection ("You're not Qui-Gon anymore," "Luke doesn't know that power," "You're in space," etc.), but _Summon Bigger Fish isn't an actual Jedi power in the first place._ Ben always responds:

    **Darkwing:** Ooh, did the nice cow tell you all that?
