**Mikoto Misaka:** What's up with your sparkling eyes? You think this is a shojo manga?!  
**Misaki Shokuhou:** I was born with them! Weren't you ever taught not to make fun of other people's bodies?

Everyone buzzes about eye colors; they look good and they can be used to determine how a character might act like, but what about the rest of the eye? That's where this trope comes in, where characters can have vastly different pupil shapes and/or sclera colors, with the optional, but corresponding eye shadow. The reasons could vary from just being an added level of exoticism, to a condition (sickness or otherwise), a reaction to something, or a way to identify that they're not entirely human. The iris' inclusion only counts if they _intentionally_ change color as a response to something.

Compare/contrast Hellish Pupils (some of these may overlap), Wingding Eyes, Eye Color Change. Super-Trope to Animal Eyes.

Technicolor Eyes is the subtrope when it's the colors of any part of the eye that are different.

    Anime and Manga 

-   In _AKB0048_, the idols all have hearts in their eyes and matching highlights in their hair. Graduated members have stars in the same places.
-   The Vestals from the New Vestroia season of _Bakugan Battle Brawlers_ don't have black pupils. Instead, their pupils are simply a darker shade of their iris color. They also lack the shiny glint that human eyes have. Not Mind-Control Eyes in that it's a racial feature that even the good guys have and everyone is acting autonomously. They also fall under the Technicolor Eyes category.
-   Can be observed on Ciel Phantomhive in _Black Butler_ in which one of his eyes glows purple with an intricate pentagram inside it. This is the mark of his covenant with Sebastian, as a result of asking for 'as much power as he could give'; because a more obvious mark allows him more power, his eyes were the most obvious place Sebastian could put it.
-   The Otherselves in _Black★Rock Shooter_ have gear-like pupils, and when their real selves are influenced by then, their irises become gear-shaped. Probably something to do with their Blue-and-Orange Morality.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   Ulquiorra Cifer has slitted pupils, used to further emphasize his moments of Dull Surprise.
    -   Ichigo and the Visoreds' scleras turn black while using their Hollow masks, while their irises turn yellow.
    -   Quilge's eyes consist entirely of vertical lines when he transforms.
    -   The Soul King's eyes are black holes with saltire crosses where his pupils should be.
    -   When Yhwach "opens his eyes," he gains additional irises, none of which look straight ahead.
-   Yumeno Kyuusaku from _Bungo Stray Dogs_ has one pupil as an open circle and the other as a star.
-   In _Code Geass_ users of the eponymous power have bird-like sigils that become visible whenever their Geass is activated. Those that fall into the command of a Geass have their scleras highlighted with the color of the Geass itself.
-   In _Death Parade_, all of the arbiters have cross shapes surrounding their pupils, a couple shades lighter than the iris. Their eyes allow them to see the memories of the dead through data transference.
-   Demons from _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_ have eyes that come with a wide variety of colors, designs, and placements. All of Twelve Kizuki have their rank on their eyeballs in the place of an iris and pupil. On top of this, they also tend to have additional unique eye features, like odd colors or strange eyelashes.
    -   In fact, most of the characters in this show have unusual eye designs, but 9 times out of 10, it doesn't actually mean anything and only serves to make the characters look more distinct.
-   Nono from _DieBuster_ has star shaped pupils. In the still illustrations that play over the end credits, they almost appear similar to Nia's.
-   In _Dream Eater Merry_ most Dream Demons have unique pupil designs, sans Chaser John Doe, who wears a mask. The eponymous Merry Nightmare has horizontal pupils, while Chukai has cross-shaped pupils, Engi has triangular pupils, Rainsborough has his pupils resembling the Tick-Tack-Toe symbol, and Chris Evergreen has tilting H-shaped pupils.
-   Ayame from _Dr. Ramune: Mysterious Disease Specialist_ has purple eyes with prominent spiral patterns reflected on it, which immediately gives away that she's not a normal little girl. Indeed, she's actually a (mentally) 112-year-old proprietor of a magical supply store. It's unknown if she's reincarnated into her current body, or if she's somehow regressed her age.
-   _Fabricant 100_: No 33 has rice-shaped lines coming from his pupils.
-   In _Fire Force_, a majority of pyrokinetics have these. They are white when their fire powers are activated and glow when in a heightened emotional state. Most are related to their abilities, such as Tamaki having vertical slits to go with her flames resembling cat ears and cat tails on her body, and Nataku having radioactive signs due to his nuclear radiation abilities. Company 7's captain, Shinmon Benimaru, takes the cake with a different design for both eyes. This signifies his status as the only character with both Second (ability to control fire) and Third (ability to generate fire) Generation Ignition abilities.
-   In the anime adaptation of _From the New World_, village leader Shisei Kaburagi has four golden pupils.
-   The Tachikoma of _Ghost in the Shell_ have distinctive triple-dot 'irises' on their spherical 'eyes'. This symbol (∴) is also used in mathematics to mean 'therefore'. "I think, therefore I am"?
-   Mimata Noa, from _Hatsukoi Zombie_, has flower-shaped irises, for some reason. Kinda fits with her cheerful and carefree personality.
-   The demon Dogma from _Hell's Kitchen (2010)_ has cross-shaped pupils.
-   In _Himouto! Umaru-chan_, this is apparently a trait of the Tachibana family, as Sylphin, her brother Alex and their mother has flower-shaped pupils when they get excited.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   The official chibi art for the series depicts the characters with spirals in their eyes.
    -   The antagonist of Part 5, Diavolo, has a white (yellow in the anime) triangle, possibly a highlight, sticking into each iris, and has curved lines around the outsides of his irises instead of pupils.
    -   In the anime, Leone Abbachio's irises feature a purple/yellow gradiant.
    -   Risotto Nero has black sclera and red pupils, for some unexplained reason.
    -   The protagonist of Part 8, Josuke (not to be confused with the other Josuke from Part 4) has eyes that are are split down the middle, and while it's difficult to tell without color both halves of the eyes are different colors. This is because he is actually a fusion between two other people.
-   _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_: Loki's Perky Female Minion Number 20 is often seen wearing night-vision goggles even during daytime. Later in the manga, she takes them off and is revealed to have green eyes with yellow star-shaped pupils.
-   The titular heroine of _Key the Metal Idol_ has a pair of purple eyes with tiny pupils and a dark purple rim. To add to her seemingly robotic appearance, they look as if they are perpetually wide with shock. When Key regains her memories and her seemingly lost humanity, they're brown and more normal-looking.
-   In _Magical Girl Site_, each magical girl is represented by a shape. Whenever she uses her powers, her pupils will change into that shape; in addition, the shape will also appear as a "gauge" on her arm, neck, or other body parts that let her know how much magic she can use until her lifespan finally runs out. Nijimin defies this by using contact lenses and by applying make-up on her arm. Because a large number of magical girls are introduced, a wide array of shapes are seen; some examples are hearts, crescent moons, stars, and English letters.
-   A popular dancer from _Manyu Hikencho_ has hearts in her pupils one moment and stars the next.
-   Mawari-san from _Mishiro San To Yamada Kun_ is drawn with two irises per eye, one around the other. They stand out even more since most of the regular cast are drawn without irises, with some not even having visible eyes, while the few other characters drawn with irises only have one per eye. Mishiro also has strange eyes, with _extremely_ small pupils and slit like irises, which are pointed out in-universe (unlike Mawari's), though it's only really noticeable in the few colored drawings of her, and when compared to the other (non-Mawari) female characters, especially her mother and sister, who have large irises (none of the male characters are drawn with irises, and the other two members of the regular cast are male, so Mawari's eyes stand out more than Mishiro's).
-   The Medicine Man's alter ego from _Mononoke_ has black sclera, red irises, and yellow pupils.
-   Nozomu's mother in _My Girlfriend Without Wasabi_ has a spiral pattern in her irises, something she inherited from her previous incarnation Winny in _Peach Boy Riverside_.
-   _Naruto_ is rather famous for this. Some characters' eyes are different because they're used for dojutsu (Sasuke's red eyes for the Sharingan, Hinata and Neji's pupil-less eyes for the Byakugan), but some characters have unusual eyes for no reason:
    -   Kiba has dog pupils, Ino has no pupils at all, and Kurenai has red eyes with a darker red ring around her pupils (bearing a slight resemblance, especially in the black-and-white of the manga, to the multiple concentric circles of the Rinnegan despite her having no eye-based powers at all).
    -   Orochimaru also has yellow eyes and vertically slitted pupils to further his resemblance to, y'know, a snake.
    -   Naruto himself in sage mode, which gives him toad-like square pupils, and vertical slits in his pupils when in the Nine-Tailed Fox forms. Then he combines Sage Mode and the Nine-Tailed Fox, giving his pupils a cross shape.
-   Jango from _One Piece_ has sort or permanent Heart Shaped Eyes. Imu's eyes also have red irises with rings around their pupils.
-   Idol Singer Ai Hoshino from _Oshi no Ko_ has eyes with pupils shaped like six-pointed stars; they represent her incredible charisma as a performer, and aren't actually noticed by anyone in-universe. Her twin children Aqua and Ruby inherited this from her, but they each have only one star-shaped pupil in one eye. Their eyes eventually change to have black star-shaped pupils in both eyes, representing how they've become motivated by hatred instead of love like Ai was. Akane also gains the same star-shaped pupils as Ai when she's able to perfectly imitate Ai's public persona.
-   _Pretty Cure_:
    -   Ha-chan, the young fairy that Mirai and Riko end up raising in _Maho Girls Pretty Cure!_, has little pink flowers in her eyes. After she becomes human in the second half of the show, she has normal eyes, but the flowers reappear whenever she transforms into Cure Felice.
    -   Mofurun, Mirai's living teddy bear from the same series, has yellow stars in her eyes. She keeps them when transforming into Cure Mofurun, which gives her a humanoid form.
    -   In _Star★Twinkle Pretty Cure_, Lala and other people of her species have yellow stars in their pupils. Yuni is a downplayed variation, as she has triangle-shaped lights in her eyes where everyone else has circular ones.
    -   All of the main characters in _Tropical-Rouge! Pretty Cure_ have hearts in the lower half of their eyes, which are emphasized when they transform by making them a different color from the rest of their iris.
-   _Queen's Blade_: Elina's eyes are usually blue, but whenever she switches to Cat Girl mode, they change color and become amber with slitted irises, like a cat's.
-   Rokudou Mukuro own brand of the Rinnegan in _Reborn! (2004)_, with red pupils and irises shaped as a kanji/number equivalent of the power his evoking in according with the Rinne Tensei.
-   _Release the Spyce_: Kurara's pupils are shaped like four-pointed stars.
-   Most of the characters from _SD Gundam Force Emaki Musharetsuden_ have cute, normal-looking eyes. However, both Teppanmaru and Saizou are notable exceptions, due to both respectively having target reticles and gears in each of their pupils.
-   The Mongol Khan and his descendants from _Shut Hell_ have, similar to the Rinnegan, several concentric circles within the iris. It's probably designed to make them look slightly unhinged.
-   Used in _Soul Eater_ for various characters heavily under the influence of of Madness.
    -   Black Star, when going mad, has his pupils replaced by white stars.
    -   Stein's eyes were completely covered by large lights extending over his head like horns during the attack on the moon.
    -   Crona's iris and pupils would sometimes be replaced by spiraling thorns, especially after absorbing Asura.
    -   Asura has red irises and vertical pupils shaped like EYES.<small>◊</small>
    -   A minor example compared to the others, but Maka is one of the only characters in the series without pupils.
    -   Kid's eyes have two shades of yellow ringing around his pupil. When he becomes a full Shinigami, Kid's pupils permanently turn into skulls.
-   _ST☆R: Strike it Rich_: Hina's pupils are shaped like stars.
-   _Tenchi Muyo!_:
    -   Ryoko takes the form of a cat during the first episode of the OVA and has catlike eyes.
    -   In the second movie spinoff, _Daughter of Darkness_, the titular character Mayuka has similar eyes. Even the color is a slightly darker version of Ryoko's gold eyes. Despite her being assumed to be Tenchi's Kid from the Future and everybody wondering who the mother is, none of the characters notice this. Turns out that Mayuka is something else entirely and the resemblance to Ryoko's eyes is purely coincidental.
-   In _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_, Nia (pictured above) has cross-shaped pupils made to resemble hippy-era flowers. Her father has spiral-shaped pupils, although it's implied that his eyes changed when he mastered Spiral Energy. Late in the series, when Kittan uses his Giga Drill Break, his pupils also become spiral shaped, as does one of Simon's in the epilogue.
-   _Venus Versus Virus_:
    -   Virus' all have eyes that are in cross shapes.
    -   Sumire's green eyes turn red when she goes into Berserker mode. Her pupils turn into crosses much like a Virus' eyes.
    -   Lucia has a golden cross-shaped eye that she hides underneath an eyepatch. As a child she was mocked and ostracized for her unusual eye.
-   Several witches in _Witch Craft Works_. Rinon is the clearest examples with pupils rather like Nia's from Gurren Laggan but Ayaka's irises appear to change shape slightly when she's using her full power as well.
-   Cheza from _Wolf's Rain_ has pink sclera, red irises and no pupils. Then again she is a genetically engineered flower-human hybrid.
-   Amo and Tachikawa in _World Trigger_ both have rather odd eyes. The latter's eyes don't even seem to have pupils, looking more like the eyes of a fly.
-   The characters in _Xabungle_ all have minus-driver (flathead) screw pupils. Since both the Civilians and Innocents have them, it's a property of the inhabitants of this work's Zora (Earth).
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_ and _Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V_: The eponymous Galaxy-Eyes monsters have eyes where you can see a literal galaxy in them. Whenever they're summoned, the camera zooms out from a galaxy to reveal that what we're looking at are the eyes of the dragons.
-   Downplayed in _Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS_. Ryoken Kogami's pupils are entirely white, but his eyes appear normal other than that.
-   Zeon from _Zatch Bell!_ has a more menacing version of this trope, with what looks like white 'sparks' in his pupils and white streaks on his irises.

    Comic Books

    -   _Wonder Woman (2006)_: While Genocide normally keeps her "eyes" covered with a spiked band they look like writhing orbs of twisting tortured human corpses, and not much like eyes at all despite their placement and round shape.

    Fanfiction 

    Film — Animated 

-   Xibalba, from _The Book of Life_, has red skulls for pupils. Normally, they're in profile so that he only has one eye socket in each eye, but they abruptly rotate to face forward during a certain exchange towards the end of the movie, to absolutely terrifying effect; it's currently the page image for the film's Nightmare Fuel.
    
    _"What, do tell, is your worst fear?"_
    
-   Archie, the scare pig, from _Monsters University_ has square pupils, like a goat.
-   Norman, Mr. Prenderghast, and Agatha from _ParaNorman_ all have faceted irises and pupils, which probably has something to do with their ability to see ghosts.
-   All the primary characters in _Rise of the Guardians_ have unique designs in their eyes based on their powers or jobs. North and Jack share blue eyes with frost patterns radiating outward from the pupil. Toothiania has purple-pink eyes that have an opalescent design in them. Bunny's eyes are grass-green with a grassy pattern radiating from the pupil. Sandy's eyes are golden-brown with a sunburst pattern radiating from the pupil. Pitch's eyes are silver with a faint yellow sunburst radiating out from behind dark pupils, reminiscent of a solar eclipse. Baby Tooth has hetero-chromatic eyes, one pink and one blue, with a similar crystal pattern as Toothiana's.

    Film — Live-Action 

    Literature 

-   Christopher Shaldred of _Baccano!_ combines extremely pale irises and solidly red sclera, giving an entirely accurate representation of his personal character.
-   Shokuho Misaki from _A Certain Magical Index_ has permanent golden star designs in her eyes. Interestingly it also shows up in the eyes of the people she mind controls. This is remarked on in-universe, when Mikoto questions just what is up with the stars in her eyes ("Do you think this is a shoujo manga!?").
-   In _Date A Live_, Kurumi's left eye is literally the face of a Victorian-era pocket watch. She usually hides it with her bangs, though in the past she used an eye patch. Spirits in general have glowing white pupils, which includes Kurumi's right eye, and the human protagonist Shido while using Spirits' powers.
-   _Discworld_ gods cannot change their eyes. Fate's are black with stars, and the Lady's are green. Not the iris; the whole eye.
-   _Eclipse_ has the Cessairu, whom are described to have eagle-shaped pupils. These eyes actually work in granting them incredible accuracy whenever they shoot someone.
-   A truly dizzying array of eye designs in _Katanagatari_, where multicoloured irises and strangely-shaped pupils are only the start. A few examples:
-   In _No Game No Life_, Tet's right pupil is of a diamond shape, and the left one is of a spade shape, fitting with him being the God of Games.
-   Dragons in _Tooth and Claw_ are said to "whirl" their eyes, though precisely what this entails is never fully articulated. The implication, however, is that every dragon has spiral-shaped pupils, and the hues of their iris and sclera shift and spin outward. A dragon's eyes are kept open upon their death by an attending parson to ensure they _don't_ whirl, so no one mistakenly begins eating the body while the dragon is still alive.
-   The witchers in _The Witcher_ series have cat-like eyes with slit pupils, as a side effect of their mutation that allows them to see in the dark.

    Live-Action TV 

-   At the end of the series finale of _Daredevil (2015)_, Agent Ben Poindexter is undergoing a risky experimental procedure so he can walk again, which is shown to have caused his iris to change into a bullseye pattern.
-   _Doctor Who_: "The Pilot" has a young woman named Heather with an unusual form of heterochromia that leaves a yellow five-pointed star on her left iris.
-   _Farscape_: The Nebari all have solid black irises with no noticeable pupils. When Chiana develops precognitive powers they temporarily blind her, turning her eyes solid white instead. After the blindness becomes permanent, she has her eyes surgically replaced for ones with white irises and slit pupils.
-   _Lucifer (2016)_ has fiery red-and yellow eyes with goatlike Hellish Pupils on his true "Devil-face". He can choose to change only his eyes to scare the crap out of someone (instead of reducing them to gibbering insanity with his full visage).
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   The telepathic Betazoids have black irises while otherwise looking exactly like humans.
    -   Xaheans have eyes that blink sideways.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _The Muppets_: Kermit the Frog has essentially Black Dot Pupils with curved lines running through in the middle, mimicking the pupils of real frogs and serving as a recognizable part of his design.

    Music Videos 

-   At the end of the famous "Thriller" video, Michael Jackson turns towards the camera to reveal that he has the yellow slit-pupil eyes from the werewolf in the movie.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In earlier editions of _Dungeons & Dragons_, ogres had pupils that were white instead of black, and anyone that had ogrish ancestry had a chance of these as well. Reference to white pupils was dropped as of the game's third edition, although nothing in subsequent editions contradicts the idea, for game masters who still want to use it.
-   In _Magic: The Gathering_, the vampires of the plane Innistrad all have black scleras and red or yellow irises.

-   _Black Souls_: Mabel's eyes are blue and studded with stars, and has a four pointed golden star for a iris with white pupil, surrounded by smaller golden circles with white pupils within them.
-   Platinum from _BlazBlue_ has heart-shaped patterns in her eyes, complimenting her role as the series' Magical Girl. The only time when her eyes lose this shape is when her rarely-seen third personality appears: Trinity Glassfile

Finally, some au ras — both Raen and Xaela — possess glowing limbal rings around the outer edges of their irises.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   _Fire Emblem: Awakening_:
        -   The newly-born princess Lucina's Brand of the Exalt, which appears somewhere on the body of all Ylissean royalty, manifests in her left eye. This is how the Lucina from the future proves her identity.
        -   If Chrom marries Olivia, then his son Inigo will have his Brand in his right eye _and_ will also use this detail to prove his identity. It doesn't actually show in his sprite, unfortunately.
    -   _Fire Emblem Fates_: The priestess Mitama has star-shaped pupils. Her supports with her father Asama state that she inherited such eyes from _him_, but the player can't see them since Asama keeps his Eyes Always Shut.
    -   _Fire Emblem Engage_: Solm royals (Timerra, Fogado, and their mother Seforia) have pupils shaped like a four-pointed star.

    -   Hu Tao, the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, has flower-shaped pink pupils.
    -   Zhongli has gold pupils with a matching line around them which may have something to do with him being Rex Lapis, Liyue's patron god. Arataki Itto has a similar pattern, but the pupil and line are both black.
    -   Kaeya and Dainsleif both have four-pointed stars for pupils. It's a Khaenri'ahn trait.

For example, the Cursed Coach<small>◊</small> has eyes resembling a crying face while Red Hot Chili<small>◊</small> has eyes resembling an angry face. Yes. _The eyes_. This is because the Unversed are embodiments of Vanitas's emotions.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:

    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_: Wart, a floating eyeball monster, has an iris with four concentric colored rings — red, yellow, black and green, going inward towards its pupil.

-   _Neptunia_: All CPUs and CPU Candidates have a glowing power symbol in their eyes when in Hard Drive Divinity, and NEXT Form adds a horizontal line to the power symbol, making the vertical line look, fittingly enough, like a plus. It should also be noted that for the Candidates, part of the power symbol does not glow, giving the impression of a gauge being filled up. _Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory_ also introduces MarvelousAQL, whose pupils are shaped like musical notes, and not just when she's excited, or something: they _always_ have that shape. And it's also never explained _why_; it's not because of some power she has, as Marvy is a Badass Normal (by this series' standards).
-   Sayu from _No Straight Roads_ has hearts for irises, and Mayday has pink star-shaped pupils.

-   _Skullgirls_: More than a few characters, most notably Valentine with cross-shaped pupils, and anyone who becomes a Skullgirl who gets their eyes changed so that the pupils look like halves of a red skull.

-   Iggy Koopa from the _Super Mario Bros._ series has thick white rings separating his pupils from his irises.
-   _Super Smash Bros._ has a zoom-in to Rosalina's eyes (well, eye) in her reveal trailer, which shows she has twinkling stars in them. Very appropiate for a cosmic guardian.
    -   Similarly to her, _Kirby_ has recently been designed to have starry vistas in his eyes as well, which is quite fitting considering the Japanese name of his series<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   _Tales of Graces_: In the epilogue, Asbel has a glowing ring within the pupil of his left eye, signifying that he has absorbed Lambda's power.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Danganronpa_:
    -   Concentric rings in the iris are very common in these games, but Hajime Hinata, protagonist of _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_, has a diagonal line across both of his pupils, resembling a prohibition symbol, while one of the masterminds of the game, Izuru Kamukura, has crosshair symbols in his.
    -   In the Gaiden Game _Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls_, the Warriors of Hope have these: Masaru Daimon has flame pattern, Kotoko Utsugi has a speech bubble, Jataro Kemuri has a scalpel, Nagisa Shingetsu has diamonds, and Monaca has a manji pattern.

    Webcomics 

-   _180 Angel_: After Molly sees the Supreme Being, she gets goat pupils.

-   _Homestuck_
    -   The alien troll Vriska Serket and her vision eightfold — which in practice means she has seven pupils in one of her two eyes, arranged into a hexagon. This is a trait she shares with her descendant/ancestor Arena (it's complicated).

-   Akila, resident Nature Spirit of _The Noordegraaf Files_ has some... _weird_ eyes. First off, they're not the rounded eyes of everyone else in the comic - they're shaped like upside down teardrops. Secondly, her sclera (the whites of her eyes) are actually _blue_, with three lighter blue stripes running vertically through her pupil. Lastly, she has slit pupils (like a lizard), instead of rounded ones like everyone else. All of this contributes to her overall "Alien" look.

The mark can appear anywhere on the girl's body and one character, Zoe, has a flower shaped mark in her left eye. Fans of Zoe's older sister ask her about the eye, such as if she can see out of it at all or if it can shoot lasers, but Zoe's too timid to give a proper answer so whether the left eye is also a Magical Eye beyond the mark itself is left up in the air. When Zoe is seen in battle for the first time, the eye changes as she closes her other eye and aims her slingshot, implying, but not confirming, an effect on her aim.
    -   After Tessa merges with Goops, her eyes change to completely white pupils and purple sclera.
