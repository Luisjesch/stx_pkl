Panchito describing a Spicy Latina with his hands (wings?).

_"Culture is the ability to describe Jane Russell without moving your hands."_

When a character is describing someone really sexy (or just their preferred gender in general), sometimes words are not enough. The character doesn't just say they have Curves in All the Right Places, they choose to _show_ how curvaceous this sexy person is by using a gesture that "paints a picture" of the person's physique.

Some of the most classic examples are:

-   The "Hourglass Figure" gesture, used to describe a sexy woman. With both hands moving in parallel, a character traces a shape in the air that is wide at the top, narrow in the middle, and wide again at the bottom. In other words, an hourglass figure: wide at the bust, narrow at the waist, and wide again at the hips.
-   The "large bosom" gesture (two cupped hands).

When used in a work, these kinds of gestures can call attention to the sexiness of the character being described, but they usually do more to emphasize the lustfulness of the character _making_ the gesture, since characters commonly direct these gestures towards their Lust Objects. In addition to showing a shape to others, the one gesturing also implicitly imagines running their hands over the body of the one they are describing. Think of it as the visual equivalent of the Wolf Whistle.

On the other hand, in scenarios where a character can't speak or doesn't speak the right language, gestures like these might be the only way the character can get the idea of "woman" (or "man") across to their audience. But even in these cases, a certain amount of lust may be implied.

There is a noticeable gender gap here; women are _far_ more likely than men to be the "targets" of these kinds of gestures, while men are far more likely to be making the gestures.
