Two characters have a fling together. They usually expect that to be it, however a while later the woman finds out she is pregnant. Bonus points if it's one or both character's first time.

Abortion may be brought up but almost never performed. A Convenient Miscarriage might occur, but more than likely the infant will be born.

This can turn out multiple ways for the father: he never learns that he fathered a kid (or doesn't learn until years later), he is a Glorified Sperm Donor who isn't in the kid's life, the parents end up co-parenting, he ends up with a Doorstop Baby and the mother runs away, or he might even begin dating the mother of his kid. In the latter case, this often results in a Shotgun Wedding. In some cases, the father might want the baby but not the mother, which complicates things further.

Sub-Trope of Law of Inverse Fertility. Often related to Abandoned War Child, Chocolate Baby, Can't Get Away with Nuthin', Shotgun Wedding, A Mistake Is Born, and Heroic Bastard. See also Chosen Conception Partner, which is when this is intentionally tried for. Compare to Child by Rape for another, less consensual, instance of characters getting easily impregnated.

Subverted in that, while this encounter really did happen, he's not Amelia's father, and Kate knows it — she _actually_ got pregnant while having regular sex with a coworker, but she doesn't want to admit it because he's not a very good person and their relationship was bad for her, and she wants Amelia to believe she came from a happy union.
