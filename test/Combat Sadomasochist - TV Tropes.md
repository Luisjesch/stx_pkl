Scared? You should be.

_"So hot... inside me... AAAH! This pain... exquisite... NNGH!!! Kill me... just like that... aaahhh..."_

Some fight for honor, others glory, and a few just for the thrill of fighting.

Then there are _these_ people.

The Combat Sadomasochist enjoys the pain from combat wounds, both their own and others'. When cut, stabbed or shot, they will moan in ecstasy and lap up the blood. After harming an opponent, and especially when they take a life, the sensation and expression on their face will be orgasmic. Their battle style will usually be intense and dance-like, and they usually eschew efficiently killing enemies in favor of doing so in the most painful way possible. Expect this character to use the Deliberate Injury Gambit a lot, especially if they actually get stronger from taking physical damage. If the Combat Sadomasochist wins the battle and there are enemy survivors, don't count on these poor souls to receive the Geneva Convention treatment of POWs. If said survivors are languishing or in pain and ask for a merciful (or at least swift) death, they'll dawdle just a bit to make them squirm by sticking fingers in wounds or shooting/stabbing them some more.

They probably evolve from a thrill seeker who craves combat adrenaline, but usually also have or develop another fetish along with this. Naturally, these types tend to be Too Kinky to Torture; even if they _do_ feel pain, they're too warped to register it as something bad. Nor do they fear death, since most perceive it as the ultimate rush. However, as extreme hedonists, they can be intimidated with the threat of a long life of bland painlessness.

If a hero has this trait, he's often an Anti-Hero or a Sociopathic Hero who limits his violence to bad guys (or worse guys than them, at least). If a bad guy has this trait (and it's usually a bad guy who has this trait, as enjoyment of other people's pain in battle is a rather villainous trait), he's usually some kind of Psycho for Hire and often Ax-Crazy.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Suzuka from _Akame ga Kill!_ enjoys receiving injuries during fights and her end game is trying to make the Empire's most sadistic person, general Esdeath, torture her. Esdeath herself can become this as well, but only if Tatsumi is the one fighting her.
-   Slan in _Berserk._ The only thing that Guts accomplishes by impaling her with the Dragon Slayer and blowing off half her torso with his Arm Cannon turns out to be _giving her an orgasm_. Yikes.
-   Alan Gabriel of _The Big O_ seemed to enjoy Roger beating on him far too much to be healthy.
-   Grell Sutcliffe of _Black Butler_. She revels in the blood and pain of herself and others, _especially_ if the pain is being inflicted to her by her beloved _Sebas-chan~!_
-   Creed from _Black Cat_, whenever he fights with Train. Even his _clothes_ are something from a sadomasochist's wardrobe. Though he's heavily more on the "masochist" side when he's against Train — he _loves_ it when Train beats the crap out of him and they end up in compromising positions (including one instance where he _orgasms_ when Train beat him up and accidentally ended up spread-legged on top of him). However, he shows no desire to physically harm Train, and in fact, one of his Berserk Buttons is if anyone _dares_ to try to put a scratch on Train's "beautiful face".
-   Shira from _Blade of the Immortal_. When he fights he deliberately goes for the limbs to incapacitate the enemy, uses a saw/sword to torture them. When his hand got cut off, he carved the flesh off his bones so he could use the bones as a weapon.
-   Kenpachi Zaraki from _Bleach_, the captain of the Gotei 13's 11th squad, didn't make his way through the ranks by excelling in the Shinigami Academy or being born into nobility like the other captains of the Gotei 13. He gained his position due to his notoriety as a murderer who only killed due to the pleasure he found in fighting. Even as a captain, he willfully skimps out on his duties to put his life (and his mission's success) in danger for the sole purpose of finding a good fight. He seldom finds joy in killing disproportionately weaker opponents. Instead he, being the sadomasochistic madman that he is, preemptively handicaps himself for his death matches; he wears bells in his hair that give away his position, purposefully uses a one handed sword style despite the size of his Zanpakuto, and willfully covers one of his eye's with an eyepatch that he had custom made to passively consume the majority of his energy. Why does he go to such lengths? He does this in order to increase the chances of his opponent actually wounding him during a death match.
-   _Broly – The Legendary Super Saiyan_ from _Dragon Ball Z_ appears to be one, given when Goku kicked him in mouth he just licked the blood off with satisfaction which freaked Goku out. Broly even lets the Z-Fighters just wail on him while he stands enjoying every bit of their vain struggle. Piccolo points out this Ax-Crazy nature and Broly justifies himself by saying "he's a demon"... very crazy.
    -   _Dragon Ball Super_: Goku Black takes delight in his own pain, typically letting his enemies give him a beating before he fights back. He laughs and smiles when Super Saiyan Future Trunks punches him in the stomach, and quite enjoys when Goku hits him as a Super Saiyan 2, saying how it powers him up. Goku is quite creeped out by this, calling him gross. The reason behind it is fairly unusual, though — Saiyans' Bizarre Alien Biology literally means that that which does not kill them only makes them stronger, and since Goku Black's body wasn't his to begin with, he's perfectly happy to let it get injured in exchange for more power. His sadism, on the other hand, is just plain old sadism.
-   _Buso Renkin_: Papillon has some masochistic tendencies when fighting, taking advantage of his Healing Factor and reacting with something close to arousal when he is injured. While he isn't quite as sadistic, he does take pleasure in fighting, and took even greater joy in eating his family.
-   Mikiri fights one in _Change 123_. This creates a problem for her, as her jiu jitsu-based fighting style relies on forcing the opponent into submission by causing pain, and this guy just can't get enough pain.
-   Shiki of _Dance with Devils_ shivers with pleasure if he gets hurt or at the anticipation of being hurt or killed, in or outside of a fight. He also gets excited to what looks like a sexual degree when there's a possibility he can hurt or kill others as well, especially to Rtisuka whom he has a Yandere crush on.
-   Two particularly nuts Contractors in _Darker than Black_ might fit. Wei has a Bloody Murder power which he uses through frequently cutting himself, which he does in a completely nonchalant manner. He's also a sadist if the slasher smiles and slurping up his own blood are any indication. Gemna makes a comment about wanting to find a woman that would hurt him and takes a clear pleasure in killing people in horrible ways.
-   In _Deadman Wonderland_ we have more than a couple of Blood Knights, but there are few people who fit _this_ trope.
    -   One is Minatsuki. Well, at least before her fight with Ganta. Afterwards, she becomes a Sociopathic Hero with a Hair-Trigger Temper that you only mess with if you have a death wish. _Beforehand_, though... let's just say the words "violence", "blood", "injury", "turn on", and "orgasm" can be pieced together in a sentence to describe her quite accurately. Fortunately, Yoh is her Morality Chain at the moment.
    -   Also, we have Genkaku, who _didn't_ get a Heel–Face Turn. Unlike Minatsuki who simply wanted to fight, not caring who, when, where, or what, Genkaku was pure evil, with _his_ Morality Chain broken looong ago. Even taking into account that this is Deadman Wonderland, home of the Dysfunction Junction, Genkaku's past is so completely and utterly fucked up (beaten to near death, raped repeatedly...), that you can consider his youth as one long line of Break the Cutie moments. When that kitten died was when he sculpted a Buddha statue out of the body parts of his tormentors.
-   Road Kamelot of _D.Gray-Man_ is a sweet little girl who likes to play. Unfortunately for the heroes, her definition of 'play' involves blood, sadism and torture both physical and mental. She seems to enjoy the taste of blood, if her happily licking Allen's blood from a sharpened birthday candle is any indication. She also has no qualms with allowing herself to be temporarily mutilated by Innocence, or even intentionally running herself through just to watch Allen's reaction.
-   Haru from _Fire Candy_ was this all the way during his youth up until it killed his wife (she was raped to death before his eyes but he did nothing to save her because he was too thrilled by her and his own suffering), in the present his guilt turned him into rather decent person but he sometimes snaps into his old persona if wrong buttons are pushed (like when his friends are kidnapped)
-   In her battle with Roy Mustang, Lust in _Fullmetal Alchemist_ combines flirting with trying to kill him, even as he keeps killing her. At one point, she comments "Didn't anyone tell you it's rude to put your hand between a woman's breasts?" — at this time, Roy is setting her on fire, and also has his hand inside of her chest, trying to destroy her Philosopher's Stone. As she dies, she makes a comment about kind of appreciating being killed by a strong man like him.
    -   Are we just not going to mention the scene in Brotherhood where Kimbley just stars lapping the blood off of his hand?
    -   Human Barry the Chopper in the 2003 series at one point gets his hand cut open by Ed. He ends up becoming estatic about seeing his own hand start bleeding.
-   Takuma Fudou from _Get Backers_. He's definitely a huge sadist towards all of his targets, though his most consistent object of obsession (and therefore sadomasochistic tendencies) is towards Ban. His greatest desire is for Ban to "give his body to him", "meet his desires", "quench his thirst" and "let him enjoy himself" — which means getting ripped apart by Fudou. But Fudou shows numerous times that he doesn't get pleasure simply from sadistically cutting up Ban — he actually _likes it more_ when Ban cuts him up and puts up a fight as well. He also shows his masochistic tendencies when he mentions that he kept his own rotting arm with him, reminding himself of what Ban did to him, which gave him "incredible chills rising up throughout his body". As well as an instance where, when Ban wasn't putting up enough of a fight, Fudou started _cutting himself up on the chest_, screaming at Ban to "make him bleed" and "push him to the edge."
-   Fasalina from _GUN×SWORD_ sounds like she's having an orgasm both when inflicting damage with her mech and when being attacked by someone else's.
-   Alucard from _Hellsing_ seems to enjoy being harmed. He has a habit of allowing his opponent to rip him to bloody pieces, only to regenerate from stuff that Wolverine wouldn't bounce back from before subjecting his opponent to a fast but drawn out, agonizing death that involves lots of dismemberment and impaling.
    -   The Major is also like this. In his infamous "I Love War!" speech, he makes it clear that getting utterly defeated and crushed by the opponent is just as exciting to him as being the one doing the crushing.
-   Evil Clown Hisoka of _Hunter × Hunter_ gets raging boners fighting worthy opponents who can land blows on him.
-   Pictured is Kakihara from _Ichi the Killer_, who is an extreme masochist yakuza. However, his last fight shows that he has his limits.
-   Jakotsu from _Inuyasha_. He has a _massively_ disturbing crush on Inuyasha; throughout the arc, whenever they encountered each other, Jakotsu would call dibs on his adorable doggie ears, and during their final confrontation in Mount Hakurei, Inuyasha turns human and Jakotsu _revels_ in his ability to actually wound him. By the end of the "fight", Inuyasha is half-conscious and unable to move from his injuries, and Jakotsu is disappointed that he didn't scream once.
-   This is Devo the Cursed's gimmick in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders_. He incites his opponents to attack him as hard as they can, then uses the pain their attacks cause to violently strike back by using his stand, Ebony Devil, to possess a Creepy Doll.
-   A milder and actually rather tragic version of this is Fushimi Saruhiko. He's usually very straight-forward in a fight but when it comes to Yata Misaki it's different. He enjoys hurting him or being hurt by him simply because it means he is finally looking at him.
-   Chair of the Disciplinary Committee Ira Gamagoori from _Kill la Kill_, whose combat uniform looks like a bondage mummy and relies entirely on damage sustained to launch a vicious counterattack using endless amounts of spiky whips. If the enemy chooses not to damage him, he is perfectly willing to whip himself in order to launch an attack. He also enjoys damage perhaps more than is healthy...
    
    _That's it! More! Punish me more! I've been a bad boy!_
    
    _Yes! That's more like it! The more I'm punished, the more my hardness towers mighty and strong!_
    
    -   It should be said that Gamagoori is less on the "sado" and more on the "masochist"; during the free-for-all Naturals Election, he came in last out of the Elite Four in the informal "who defeated the most One-Star students" competition due to only fighting in self-defense.
-   One of the knights from _MÄR_, Candice, fights using an ärm that gives her more magical energy the more she's damaged, then changes the opponent to stone. It's creepier than it sounds.
-   Kumagawa Misogi from _Medaka Box_ doesn't _have_ to wait until he's been beaten to a bloody pulp before erasing his injuries and curbstomping his opponents... but he certainly prefers to.
-   In _Michiko & Hatchin_, the title character insinuates that her rival Atsuko used to get aroused whenever Michiko would beat her up when they were younger.
-   Hidan in _Naruto_ uses this and his "immortality" as his gimmick. It's even heavily implied that he achieved an orgasm when he stabbed himself (which was also the lethal blow for Asuma).
-   _No Longer Allowed in Another World_: Lacking any fighting skills or experience (not to mention his suicidal tendencies), Sensei usually lets his opponents attack him without so much as a flinch. That said, his perpetually poisoned status effect makes him a giant safety hazard, instantly poisoning to death any monster that tries to eat him. His dark disposition and No Sense of Personal Space also makes for effective psychological warfare, managing to scare off three thug otherworlders who were perfectly willing to kill him by goading them into doing it.
-   _One Piece:_
    -   Sadie, one of the Impel Down jailers, fits this pretty well. As befits her name, she enjoys dishing it out to both prisoners and her subordinates alike. She also has the dominatrix look in full, whip included.
    -   Kaido, one of the Four Emperors, has an entire _squad_ of such people, who are called the Pleasures. They'll smile and laugh even as they are being beaten into a pulp. Though it's mainly because the artificial devil fruits they ate made them unable to express anything but joy.
    -   Dice from _One Piece Film: Gold_ is a blatant example, Franky and Zoro were quite freaked out when Dice had a near orgasm from their attacks.
-   Vincent Nightray of _PandoraHearts_ quite enjoys torturing people (and even has the unnerving habit of hacking up stuffed animals with scissors), mostly for his own gratification but occasionally with the intention of seeing what kind of face his elder brother Gilbert will make. In the short extra "Servants and Scissors," however, it's revealed that he may have a masochistic side as well when Leo, his new master, kicks him in the face and he cheerfully comments, "I... have come to a realization. Tormenting is fun, however, being tormented, surprisingly, isn't all that bad."
-   Corset of _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ is a bondage demon who wears a corset that he tends to tighten every once in a while and can even use it to go One-Winged Angel.
-   _Persona 4: The Animation_ has Shadow Kanji's two flunkies. One enjoys being burned, the other enjoys being frozen. They both like being hit and squeezed.
-   Belphegor of _Reborn! (2004)_. During their battle, Gokudera manages to hit him with one of his bombs. Belphegor simply sits up while making somewhat orgasmic noises and muttering excitedly "I was hurt again. It's so thrilling!" He also seemed to take great pleasure in trying to cut Gokudera and, in his words, "turn him into a cactus".
-   _Rosario + Vampire_: Routier. Although she doesn't like being hurt herself, she adores cutting others up.
    -   Ruby Hojo is the opposite. She's not a sadist, but a masochist. Electrocuting her has little effect on her and she "does not _not_ like it".
-   After being defeated — but not killed — by Kenshin when he kidnapped Kaoru, Jin-e commits suicide in order to avoid being arrested and starting an investigation as being a hired assassin for the new Meiji Government — but he enjoys the fact that the feeling of stabbing himself in the chest was "so sweet." He dies with his iconic smile on his face too.
    -   Jin-e was also quite enthusiastic when Kenshin crushed his nose in with the blunt edge of the sakabato, since the force of Kenshin's attack meant that he was drawing closer to his Battousai persona due to Jin-e casting a powerful technique on Kaoru that rendered her paralyzed, which set off Kenshin's bad side, to say the least.
-   _Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas_ has Scorpio Kardia, whose ultimate desire is to have a fight so exciting that will end up killing him.
    -   Also, at the age of ten, Kardia was offered a chance to cure his heart disease, the catch? Immortality! So he turned it down! WHAT!?
-   Gorobei Katayama from the anime _Samurai 7_ appears to get turned on twice in the series: once from almost being shot in the forehead by an arrow with minor bleeding, then during a fight with the yakan/Nobuseri when a bullet grazes his cheek, also drawing blood.
-   Karasuba from _Sekirei_. After having a brief run-in with the most powerful Sekirei, Miya Asama, she becomes so excited that she has to go out and kill someone to relieve herself. Turns out, this is because Miya nearly killed her the last time they saw each other. Karasuba fondly recalls it, stating that she wants to experience that "fear and pain" again.
-   Ferid, a male vampire of _Seraph of the End_ waxes poetically about how beautiful Kururu is and how much he loves her even after she cuts his arm off and verbally expresses her contempt for him. He also takes great enjoyment over crushing people's spirits, drinking them to the point of death, and observing their distraught emotions when he torments them.
-   Stein and Medusa engage in a bit of this during their fight in _Soul Eater_. Spirit reckons Stein is simple to understand, being a 'hedonistic sadist'. Worth pointing out that he's the Equippable Ally being used to cut the witch to bits and so is party to the whole thing.
-   In _Upotte!!_, the antagonist, Sako, takes this to such an extent that she literally withdraws from battle to pleasure herself to the thought of killing Ichiroku
-   Dark Marik of _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ is the embodiment of this trope, despite the fact that he fights via a children's card game. His whole deck style is based around torturing his opponent's monsters before killing them, and he uses magic to make his opponent feel the pain as well, and often gets around to torturing his opponents directly before too long. In addition to his extreme sadism, he's also a bonafide masochist — he begs his opponents to spice up the duel by hitting him or cutting him. Most of his dialogue consists of ranting about pain and suffering, and when he's attacked by Obelisk the Tormentor and nearly killed, his response is to burst out laughing.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_:
    -   Yubel. They have been shown to have an enormously warped and sadomasochistic view of love: because love, in part, is sharing feelings, both joy and suffering, Yubel therefore legitimizes Jaden's suffering as "true love". Yubel feels they have suffered greatly due to their time in space and the crash into the Earth that caused them to lose most of their body, and desires to share that suffering with Jaden. To that end, they go out their way to make him suffer. They also openly welcome Jaden's insults and defiance, seeing the pain they suffer as Jaden expressing his "love".
    -   Zane Truesdale. He duels with shock collars and clearly enjoys himself while doing so.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   The Black Mask had a high threshold for pain. In his own words:
        
        _"...Do you know what REAL strength is? The ability to accept pain. ANY amount of pain. Not to ignore it, that never works."_
        
        -   And as for the "sado" in "sadomasochist", Cold-Blooded Torture is his _hobby_. "You must embrace it... almost love it, in a way. So, do you love it, little girl? DO YOU?"
    -   The Joker. It could be attributed to the psychological fixation he has on Batman, however the undertones of his actions and indeed, his _re_actions (laughing maniacally, begging for more, relishing the _pain_, as well as delighting in the aggression he elicits from the bat, makes Joker a very very sado/maso man.
-   Also, really obscure Marvel character, The Crippler. Exactly What It Says on the Tin.
-   In keeping with the comic's pattern of "Technically Living Zombie Apocalypse... but much, much worse", the _Crossed_ really get off on brutal atrocities, whether they're on the giving or receiving end.
-   Etrigan. All demons are sadomasochists and are able to become stronger by receiving pain, but Etrigan, being more powerful than the average demon, is better at it than most.
    
    Blood is drawn! I am impressed — though my hell-spawned powers will heal it! Besides...next to giving pain, my favorite sport's to feel it!
    
-   A central theme of _Marshal Law_. San Futuro is overrun by gangs of superheroes who, enhanced not to feel pain, inflict pain on others and get themselves horribly injured in order to feel _something_. Marshal Law himself is no exception — he enjoys brutally killing other superheroes, but wears barbed wire wrapped around his arm and a costume that resembles bondage gear to symbolize his self-loathing.
-   Walter in the original _The Mask_ is an Implacable Man due to combining Super-Toughness with being a sadomasochist. No pain ever fazes him, and in fact he repeatedly hurts himself seemingly to pleasure himself as he goes about his business.
-   Moon Knight, Depending on the Writer. Taskmaster once stated that the reason he doesn't use Moon Knight's fighting style is because Moon Knight would rather take a punch than block it.
-   Granny Goodness, Darkseid's personal Torture Technician, spends most of her time inflicting pain in the Orphanage of Fear she runs. But then she has exchanges like this while fighting Amanda Waller...
    
    **Granny:** Did that hurt? Good, it was supposed to.  
    **Amanda Waller:** Yeah, it hurt. Does this? (rifle-butts her) It's SUPPOSED to! _(hits her again, knocking her flat)_  
    **Granny:** That's all right, dearie. Granny _likes_ pain.
    
    -   Likewise, when Parademon, one of Granny's "children," is tortured along with his comrades in the _Secret Six,_ he has little trouble coping with it.
        
        **Parademon:** Thank you, Granny! May I have another?!
        
    -   Similarly, when Desaad possessed Mary Marvel in _Final Crisis_, he developed into one of these and seemed to get off on Supergirl striking her, and started to blatantly come on to her the more Supergirl fought.
-   Robbie Baldwin aka Speedball aka Penance of the _New Warriors_. As Penance, he wore a suit with spikes lined inside it that would cut him, fueling his energy blasts. He eventually had a psychological breakthrough when he (with help from a therapist) realized that the real reason being cut empowered him was because he was getting _high_ on the endorphins his body was releasing. The trigger for his powers — being happy — hadn't really changed.
-   Mondo Pain, an old _Punisher_ villain. Whenever someone pulled a gun on him, he'd also enjoy psyching them out, saying that even if they shot him, he'd still kill them. When he tried it on Frank, he was shocked when he actually _did_ shoot him.
-   Marv from _Sin City_ seems to enjoy what little damage he sustains in fights. In _A Dame To Kill For_ he meets Dwight after Dwight had gotten into a particularly brutal fight. Dwight's monologue mentions that he spat out a tooth and Marv smiled at him as if they shared the same enjoyment of violence. Dwight was not as amused.
-   In their first fight in _Supreme Power_, Doc Spectrum punched Hyperion very hard and the invulnerable superhero actually felt it. He wanted more, because he'd never felt anything like it.
-   _The Ultimates_: Since he's driven purely by id, there's not really that much difference to Ultimate Hulk separating sex and violence. He considered getting beaten to a pulp by Princess Zarda to be _foreplay_.
-   _Watchmen_:
    -   The Comedian accuses Hooded Justice of getting aroused by beating up people, and judging by HJ's reaction, Comedian was almost certainly right.
    -   The second Nite Owl mentions having multiple run-ins with a masochist who would dress up like a supervillain and ask the superheroes to beat him up. He made the mistake of asking Rorschach, and got thrown down an empty elevator shaft. Silk Spectre II had tangled with the masochist and commented that he was breathing weird while she was beating him up.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: In this _Godzilla_ MonsterVerse fanfiction, MaNi/Elder Brother is even more Ax-Crazy than when he was sharing a body with Ghidorah's other two heads. He's obsessed above all else with getting to fight, tear apart and fuck a wild, fury-driven Monster X forever, and he doesn't mind being on the receiving end of Monster X's retaliation in the slightest (at least, not until his Undignified Death).
-   In _Supergirl_ story _Hellsister Trilogy_, slaughter and destruction turn Satan Girl on. After smashing a starship to pieces she feels so aroused than she needs sex.
-   _Broken Heroes_: When Kairi twists Vanitas's arms behind his back, he outright tells her that he enjoys pain and all she's doing is stopping him from moving.
-   _Fractured (SovereignGFC)_, a _Mass Effect_/_Star Wars_/_Borderlands_ crossover takes the Siren Lilith's canonical Power High and pushes it far thanks to "JumpPaks", a form of combat stimulant invented by an Insane Admiral. In the end, she pulls a Heel–Face Turn due to a Mistreatment-Induced Betrayal and begs for help from one of the heroes before her redemption through death.
-   _Star Wars: Paranormalities_ introduces us to the Valkoran commander and deranged ex-Sith Lord (and fittingly-named), Masochus. He's a sociopath that not only enjoys subjecting people to slow, horrifying deaths or worse, he also enjoys pain inflicted on himself, enough that he (somehow) flayed himself down to the bone and made himself look like a zombie. Unfortunately for him, this had the side-effect of making him rely on the Force to move his own body like a string puppet from then on.
-   _Sailor Moon Abridged_: Sailor Mars (Raye). Dear God, Mars...
-   A downplayed example in _A Fantastic Upheaval of Previously Held Notions_. When Barbara interrogates Strickler about his plans in the Janus Order, she uses the magical bond he placed upon them by bumping her elbow whenever she hears something she doesn't like. She even threatens to severely cripple herself (taking him along with her) if he does anything to seriously hurt her son. Even Draal thinks she's overdoing it a little by that point despite being impressed by her quick thinking.
-   In _Son of the Sannin_, when the time comes for Naruto to tame Kurama, he enters the Genjutsu World seen in the _Road to Ninja_ movie. At one point, he spars with Genjutsu World!Hinata, who moans in pleasure every time he lands a hit on her. He mentally cringes and hopes that the real one isn't like that.
-   In _Hero Academia D×D_, Yaoyorozu Momo is just awakening to her own hidden desires, which she regards as shameful, but she cannot avoid them after becoming Rias Gremory's Queen (she's a Composite Character with Akeno Himejima, after all).
-   In _A Clash Of Neets_, Margaery Tyrell is a reincarnation of Darkness, so naturally she ends up becoming a knight for, among other reasons, getting herself beaten — much to the shame of her own family. She almost orgasms when Gregor Clegane hits her with her sword, and seeing Robb turn into a feral werewolf that is looking at her with murderous intent makes her excited.

    Films — Animation 

-   Tzekel Khan from _The Road to El Dorado_ was a little too happy when Miguel and Tulio were pretend-fighting, slapping, and punching. Of course, he didn't like it when they double punched him. Also, this is the guy who is always excited for a human sacrifice!

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The Joker from _The Dark Knight_ giggles whenever he's struck. He shows particular amusement while being beaten half to death by Batman, because he is technically winning the fight by having Batman surrender to a core evil. He lives to prod and poke Batman like a hungry kid after school, just waiting for Brucey to finally snap and "break his one rule", which is to never kill anybody.
    -   And of course, his final scene in the film when Batman throws him off the tower, and he's _laughing maniacally_ for every single second of his descent.
-   Castor Troy in _Face/Off_ often looks like he's orgasming whenever he does bad things For the Evulz, as shown when after planting a bomb, while disguised as a priest, he gropes a blonde choir girl. Also implied by his face during the scene in the opening plane chase where he pushes one of Sean Archer's undercover agents out the cabin door for Archer to see, and then promptly executes her.
-   Tyler Durden from _Fight Club_ breaks into orgasmic laughter while being bludgeoned by an angry bar owner, all the while refusing to fight back.
-   Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp from _GoldenEye_, whose Combat Sadomasochism is part of her psychotic character. Plus her Signature Killing Move. In this sequence, she's into full-blown Orgasmic Combat territory when gunning down everyone in the Severnaya bunker, which leads to a "What the hell is wrong with you?" Eye Take from General Ouromov.
-   In _Mandy_, the Black Skulls are an extremely violent, possibly demonic biker gang who wear outfits resembling BDSM gear. It's said they're in constant pain, but they love it.
-   Freddy Krueger in _A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master_ starts laughing loudly as he is punched repeatedly by Alice. However there are many times where he doesn't enjoy pain at all, considering that he is a demon, he might not feel pain the same way as human does.
    -   In _Freddy's Dead_ it's revealed that Freddy practiced self-harm in his human life. He even mutilates himself in the first movie.
-   Pearl from _Payback_ smiles and licks the blood when she gets hit in the face, and begins _visibly panting_ in excitement when a handgun is pointed at her.
-   Guess that makes Katinka Ingabogovinanana from _Zoolander_ one too, given that it apparently inspires some Les Yay when Matilda pistol whips her.

    Literature 

-   Hamyuts Meseta from the _Book of Bantorra_ was reconditioned to "Take joy from pain, to take pleasure from death" and then sent to fight in afterlife where one could "die" only by giving up on the will to exist. She enjoyed it far too much for audience comfort, nevermind the poor sod who had to break her or die himself.
-   In _Codex Alera_, High Lord Kalarus's elite Immortal troops have been conditioned from a young age via discipline collars to be absolutely loyal to him, and to take pleasure in pain during combat, rendering them very difficult to kill.
-   In _Counselors And Kings_, the Crinti (mixed-blood descendants of humans and dark elves) are a Proud Warrior Race who revere Loviatar, the goddess of pain (see the Forgotten Realms entry under Tabletop Games for details). As such, they love the thrill of the fight regardless of how much it hurts, and are explicitly noted to _entice_ their enemies to battle rather than trying to drive them away.
-   This sums up Gauron from _Full Metal Panic!_ quite nicely. Put him against Sousuke and sweet Jesus does he take this to extremes. Normally, towards anyone and everyone, he's a huge sadist. It's even stated several times in the novels that he derives a sick, perverted sort of pleasure from getting other people to submit to him, as well as from cutting them up or causing them any other sort of pain (be it emotional or physical). When Sousuke is brought into the picture, however, he displays _hardcore_ masochistic tendencies — to the point where he seems to feel that the ultimate pleasure would be to have them die together. During every fight between the two of them, Gauron gets _very_ turned on. In the novels, he even mentions that during one of their fights, he felt... disturbing impulses to kill and rape Sousuke. In that order.
-   Drake in _Gone_. Attacking him usually results in him cheering that he's "unkillable" and then murdering you. To make matters creepier, he gets stabbed in the chest and finds it hilarious.
    
    _"This should be fun." Then with his real hand, he drew the knife out of his chest, slowly, as if relishing every inch of steel._
    
-   Bellatrix Lestrange in the _Harry Potter_ novels has evidence of being both a masochist and sadist. In the film of _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_, she is shown licking Voldemort's "mark" on her arm, a tattoo of power which is described as being painful once Voldemort returns. She also tells Harry that he's not doing it right when he uses the Cruciatus curse on her, as you have to enjoy it for it to really work. She would know, torturing people is her hobby.
-   Akeno Himejima from _High School D×D_ takes a great deal of pleasure from inflicting pain in others, and her primary method of doing this is in her combat support role as Rias Gremory's Queen.
    -   Her father the fallen angel Baraqiel on the other hand is a straight up Masochist.
    -   Walburga from the same series also qualifies as a Combat Sadomasochist, though she is a lesser known character at the moment.
-   Lucius of the Emperor's Children in the _Horus Heresy_ novels. Every time he scores a kill he carves a scar into his face.
-   _Iron Warriors_ and _Ultramarines_, two _Warhammer 40,000_ series, jointly give us Notha Etassay, a Slaaneshi blademaster. Put it this way: after Warsmith Honsou defeats him in combat by stomping hard on his ribcage, when Etassay recovers, he _thanks_ Honsou for the exquisite sensation of bone shards through the lungs. He also enjoys dying from the deadly toxins of an Eversor assassin waaaaaay too much.
-   Darkness in _KonoSuba_ is known as a brave and daring warrior, but the main reason she does heroic deeds is because she's a masochist who _wants_ to put herself in harm's way for the thrill of being hurt. The comments she makes while fighting make it _very_ clear that she enjoys pain and humiliation in a sexual way, even admonishing monsters and villains for not doing terrible, degrading things to her. Most of the bad guys are even more creeped out of Darkness than normal people are of the monsters because of how kinky Darkness finds combat. For bonus points, Darkness did Min-Maxing in-universe so that she could indulge in her kink without being seriously injured.
-   _New Jedi Order_: The Yuuzhan Vong attach religious significance to pain, so it's unsurprising that the most fanatical of them are like this (and the ones who aren't _that_ crazy can still take all but the most horrific punishment without blinking). This is explicitly pointed out by half-Vong Jedi Tahiri when facing Lord Nyax, an immensely powerful darksider whose favorite attack involves forcing his opponents to feel crippling agony — most people drown in pain, she says, but the Yuuzhan Vong _swim in it_. Cue Oh, Crap! from Nyax... It's implied (if not outright stated) that they love pain because, after they were cut off from the Force, it's the only way they know they're still alive. Also, their religion teaches that the ultimate god (Yun Yuuzhan) cut himself up into a bunch of pieces to make the very universe itself. Of course, the best way to honor him is to follow his example. Cue excessive scarring, tattooing, and removal of their own body parts (and replacement with bioengineered creatures, usually better than the original limb/organ).
-   Richard Lopez of _Ship Breaker_ has some characteristics of this, what with constantly trying to gain new scars, and laughing while he slaughters people.
-   Darquesse from _Skulduggery Pleasant_ is not entirely a combat sadomasochist, being able to shut off her pain sensors, but at one point during her battle with Vile intentionally allows him to gouge out her eye to see what the pain feels like.
-   The Mord-Sith of the _Sword of Truth_. Crazed sadomasochist women tortured since childhood until they are impervious to all but the most extreme pain, and living for little other than to serve the Lord Rahl and inflict more pain with their Agiel, a sort of hand-held Agony Beam. They receive as much pain themselves as they dish out, because the use of their Agiel causes them constant pain when in use just as it hurts the person on the receiving end. Though every time someone manages to crack one's armor it turns out they are just big softies inside. For example, Rikka's obsession with getting Nicci into a pink frilly nightdress.
-   _Tales from Jabba's Palace_ expands on the backstory of EV-9D9, the torture chamber boss droid seen in _Star Wars: Return of the Jedi_. She was a supervisor droid accidentally built with a unit meant for interrogators, which let her feel pain (her own and others') and made it pleasant. As such, when she's eventually killed by a vengeful survivor, she's not upset to die, only that he removed her pain unit before finishing the job.
-   The kelpie from _War of the Dreaming_ are rotting, festering, diseased knights who _very firmly_ believe that life is hell.
    
    **Kelpie:** Why do you resist? Life is pain!  
    _\[Raven breaks its arm\]_  
    **Kelpie:** Thank you! _\[faints\]_
    
-   The Jachyras from _The Wishsong of Shannara_. Elder fairy creatures addicted to pain, both their own and that of others. They'll tear themselves apart in order to kill an opponent, laughing the entire time. Thank god there are only two of them. As it is, it takes the greatest Druid ever, _and_ one of the most Badass Normals in fantasy fiction to put them down, at the cost of their own lives. Bad news, there are way more than two of them. It's just two was all the Mord Wraiths had released from where they were trapped. Oh and said trapping? It was done by both the good _and_ evil faeries working together to get rid of them.
-   _The Witch of Knightcharm_: Chosovi is shown to be this during the first Wizard Duel that we see. All of the new students are given magic stones which allow them to feel what the combatants feel, but when one combatant begins taking excruciating damage, most of the rookies drop their stones. Chosovi, however, hangs on to hers and has a big grin on her face as she savors every detail and sensation of the duel.
-   In _Worm_, the monstrous supervillain Crawler has a massive Healing Factor and an Adaptive Ability which makes him Come Back Strong every time anything damages him. He loves becoming stronger and he loves it when things damage him. Piggot exploits this by telling Crawler where they're about to drop a Tinker-tech bomb and he can't resist the opportunity; he stands totally still and lets it hit him, and ends up transmuted into glass, finally killing him.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Gekikara from the _AKB48_ drama, _Majisuka Gakuen_. She doesn't even bother with trying to block or dodge, she just takes the hits and hits back harder, while cackling maniacally the whole time. When gossiping about her, Team Hormone says that she doesn't care about winning or losing, she just loves the violence.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Spike is an example of this trope. Although he doesn't take it over the top, he likes having Buffy beat him up, and one of his major complaints when he becomes an Intangible Man is that he can't hit people. At one point, Angel is battling a necromancer while Spike tries to possess him, and when Spike finally wins the battle for control, he keeps fighting Angel a bit for this reason. Lampshaded on several occasions, most notably when Spike makes his Anguished Declaration of Love.
        
        **Joyce:** Honey, did you somehow, unintentionally, lead him on in any way? Send him signals?  
        **Buffy:** Well, I do beat him up a lot. For Spike, that's like third base.
        
    -   The vampire Monster of the Week Zachary Kralik is another example. When Buffy tries to ward him off with a cross, he presses himself against it. He clearly gets off on it burning him.
-   _The Boys (2019)_: Stormfront is a vicious sadist who enjoys watching the light fade from people's eyes while she kills them, plus she takes pleasure above all else in feeling Homelander's Eye Beams burn her chest.
-   Fiona from _Burn Notice_. Michael specifically says that she regards violence as foreplay, and the first time that the two hook up again is after Fiona forces him into fighting her.
-   _Game of Thrones_: Ramsay Bolton seems to have the time of his life during Yara's raid despite getting cut up.
-   Denna from _Legend of the Seeker_. Among others things she tastes Richard's blood, clearly enjoys using her Agiel on people (despite the pain it brings to herself), and wears leather.
-   In the HBO series _Rome_, Mark Antony is shown making two naked women fight each other with swords for his pleasure. When the other one gets wounded, he halts the fighting and licks the blood from the wound.
-   _Z Nation_ has Charles Garnett who is revealed via Warren's flashback to have been sexually aroused by killing zombies.

    Myths & Religion 

-   In one version of _Jason And The Argonauts_, they run into a tribe of savages devoted to Ares, who fight not so much to kill than to see the blood run. Homer describes Ares as "_tukton kakon_", which translates as "manmade evil". If you were to worship Ares, then you would hold embodying this trope to be your holy duty.

    Roleplay 

-   In _The Gamer's Alliance_, Vaetris and her succubi minions of the Eastern Horde get turned on by causing pain to others and receiving pain in combat and sex. They're really turned on by seeing and smelling blood.
-   Geier von Engelmacher of _Orderly Chaos_, though he falls more on the masochistic side of this trope.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The clerics of Kor, the god of bloodshed and warfare in _The Dark Eye_, come close to this, since only a fight in which they are grievously wounded, while killing or maiming their enemy, is considered a _good fight_.
-   In _Dungeons & Dragons_, the various versions of the Shadar-kai tend towards this. In all editions, they live in the Plane of Shadow/Shadowfell (in 3e, they're fae who were Hoist by His Own Petard when they tried to use its power to conquer the material plane, in 4e, they're humans that migrated there in search of immortality, and in 5e, they're elves banished there for supporting the Raven Queen). In 3 and 4e, at least, this inflicted them with the Shadowcurse, which tied their life to their stimulation. If a Shadar-kai succumbs to ennui, they start to fade away. So to a Shadar-kai, taking injuries in combat isn't just fun, it helps keep them alive.
-   _Exalted_: this is kind of the idea behind Laughing Wounds Style, which was invented by one of the Abyssal Exalted. It starts with a Charm that lets you treat wound penalties as bonuses, and only gets more ridiculous from there. Its capstone Charm allows the user to _rip an enemy's still-beating heart out of their chest,_ which makes the enemy helpless to resist the Laughing Wounds practitioner's other powers.
-   _Forgotten Realms_ has servants of Loviatar ("Maiden of Pain"). They're rather funny like this. In _The Night Tymora Sneezed_ one priestess fought a paladin... he was ticked off by her comments even more than by her lash.
-   Skorne Nihilators in _Hordes_. The Skorne believe that pain makes you stronger, but the Nihilators are members of something called Cult of Pain which takes it to a whole new level. They spend most of their free time inflicting as much pain to themselves as their bodies can take, and in combat they fight like frenzied berserkers, ignoring debilitating blows and striking at anything within reach, friend or foe.
-   In one of the _Shadowrun_ source books there is a particularly dodgy weapon system described. A targeting cyberlink/weapon-camera which rewards every killshot with a boost of endorphins in order to encourage improved accuracy. The results proved to be rather terrifying and the system never went commercial. Although there are supposedly finished units in circulation on the black market.
-   _Vampire: The Masquerade_:
    -   Members of the Tzimisce clan could acquire powers that made them find pain pleasurable, and thus became oddly better fighters as they were injured. The clan was also notorious for sadomasochistic tendencies.
    -   In the adventure module _Blood Bond_, when the characters get into a fight with a pack of Sabbat the text suggests demonstrating how crazy the Sabbat are by having one of them receive a hard hit, then grin and _thank_ the attacking character for it before returning the favour.
-   _Vampire: The Requiem_: The Impaled, a subgroup/cult within the Ordo Dracul. Their theory is that Dracula never achieved his transcendent state because he spent too much time doing the impaling and not enough time being impaled himself; thus, he never learned the truth that can be found in pain. So these guys _impale themselves_, often for days at a time, until they frenzy or are driven into torpor from the hunger or the pain. The bonus is that these guys learn to resist and ''love'' pain, making them damned scary to fight against.
-   _Warhammer_ and _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Followers of Slaanesh frequently become such, as part of their twisted pursuit of finding ever more "exotic" sensations to enjoy.
    -   One Witch Hunter, faced with Slaaneshi cultists who wouldn't spill the beans and eagerly awaited torture, concocted a potion that _removed_ their ability to feel any physical sensation. They confessed right away.
    -   In _Warhammer 40000_, the Dark Eldar (their counterparts in _Warhammer_, the Dark Elves, are more of a Social Darwinist race...). Dark Eldar are generally more into the "sado" part (unlike followers of Slaanesh who consider inflicting and receiving pain to be equally pleasing), but they do enjoy the sensation of pain in combat as well (for example, typical Dark Eldar armor is secured in place with painful hooks and barbs). Dark Eldar even have an in-game rule, Power from Pain, that reflects this: Dark Eldar units gain pain tokens when they kill enemy units, and pain tokens unlock bonuses. A Dark Eldar player starts with a full army of normal troops, but as the battle wears on, the enemy's army takes casualties and grow weaker, whereas the surviving Dark Eldar become ravenous killing machines who can laugh off enemy fire, and fight much more ferociously in combat.

    Video Games 

-   SIE in _Alpha Protocol_. She appears to get off to domination contests outside combat as well.
-   Lucile in _Asdivine Cross_. Lucile is a Blue Mage, who learns new spells and skills after they were used on her. Fortunately, Lucile is a huge masochist, and is very happy to be the target of enemy attacks. "Ahhh... That hit the spot" after receiving a hit is her catchphrase.
-   _Atlas Reactor_: Rask and Orion, both freelancers who gain Energy from being attacked, will both encourage their opponents when damaged.
    
    **Rask:** _(growls)_ ...MORE!  
    **Orion:** IT HURTS... SO GOOD.
    
-   Father Balder from _Bayonetta_ invokes this trope during his Boss Battle. When Bayonetta headbutts a _building_ back at him, he will fall, get up, crick his neck and softly moan. Same with a _satellite_!
-   Animus from _The Black Heart_ is an immortal sadomasochist gender-switching Humanoid Abomination whose combat techniques include piercing both himself and an opponent with massive rusted blades (one of his grabs has him pin the opponent to the ground before doing this, rather suggestively), running on a buzzsaw blade that tears into his unfortunate victim, and setting himself on fire to burn the opponent, all of this laughing, no matter if he's hitting the enemy or if the enemy is hitting him. And in his story mode he claims that his own blood brings him pleasure (although the fact of existing makes him sick).
-   In _Borderlands 2_, this fits Krieg's playstyle like a glove. Many of his skills follow the theme of making him stronger the closer he is to death, such as giving an increased fire rate when his shields are down. His action skill recharges faster when he takes damage, and you can take a skill that makes him susceptible to friendly fire just so your teammates can help it recharge too. He has an entire skill tree devoted to being on fire. Many of his quotes have him scream about how much he loves pain. The last remnants of his sanity that make up the voice in his head don't feel the same.
-   In _Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!_, Nisha is equal parts sadistic and masochistic, which is represented by her Law & Order tree. The skill tree functions on gaining stacks of Order whenever she takes damage equivalent to 15% of her health, which initially simply gives her a chance to heal the damage taken. By going down further into the tree, she can deal bonus damage to enemies that have damaged her as well as gaining various different buffs the more damage she's taken.
-   _Brutal Orchestra_: Choir Boys have the masochism passive, meaning they get one more action per turn every time they take damage. Normally this would just be annoying, but it's always active and a good half of its move pool consists of self-damage, and it's quite tanky too.
    -   Along with that, both a party member named Burnout and a boss named Roids _laugh_ when they're hit, despite having no abilities that benefit from it.
-   The Tainted Coil in _Brütal Legend_, especially their leader Doviculus. It's why Tim Schafer chose Tim Curry for the role.
-   Silver Mantis in _City of Heroes_.
    -   Corruptors and Masterminds have access to a special powerpool known as _Pain Domination_, which works by taking pain (damage) from allies and bringing it upon yourself. You get buffs for doing so, and it's heavily implied that users of Pain Domination powers enjoy the pain of combat...
-   _Darkest Dungeon_ combines this with Nightmare Fetishist. As an insanity, a character can become Conditioned to Accept Horror this way. Some classes outright beg enemies to attack them, others want to see what new abominations they'll be fighting. Characters with the affliction will sometimes shove their way up to the front of the party so they'll get hit more.
    -   The Flagellant is a class powered by this trope. Through pain and bloodshed he seeks holy power, and gets it, so any blows he takes and delivers just further the cause. That, and he's gotten rapturous so many times from whipping himself to the brink of death, reaching it again through others' strikes is just par for the course. Notably, he cannot get the above insanity or any others, barring his own unique "Rapturous" state.
-   In _Disco Elysium_ this is a potential effect of having a high Pain Threshold skill. Not only will you shrug off the damage taken, but your character will like it. As such, having a high threshold can make you a pretty unhealthy person.
-   The Sacrier class in _Dofus_ actually becomes more powerful by taking damage.
    -   The personalities depicted in Dofus and related media certainly apply as well. The Goultard convention short film has one particularly pronounced Sacrier villain. In _Wakfu_, the remaining Sacriers (such as Kriss Krass) are toned down in many ways but retain the basic premise.
-   The Reaver specialization in _Dragon Age: Origins_ is this turned into a game mechanic. Warriors using the associated talents will inflict extra damage, in proportion to how badly injured they are.
-   The Dark Mistress from _Dungeon Keeper_. If it's any indication, she moans in ecstasy when attacking, she sleeps in an iron maiden, she is initially lured to your dungeon when you build a torture chamber, and when there is no one for her to torture, she straps herself in and tortures herself.
-   _Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII_ gives us Rosso the Crimson, who moans a lot and quite literally states that "pain is pleasure." But though she doesn't mind pain, she seems to have problems not being on top. When Vincent defeats her, she commits suicide so that no one will ever be greater than her. This is kind of odd, considering that Rosso is MAYBE third in command of Deepground. Apparently, she made exceptions.
-   _Final Fantasy XIII_: Implied to be the case with Jihl Nabaat. She seems just a little _too_ happy at the prospect of seeing two l'Cie kill each other, and takes great pleasure in using her baton to slap Sazh around. Despite her Villainous Breakdown in Chapter 9, when the party actually arrive, she seems all too pumped to fight them; it's just too bad the Big Bad one-shots her before she gets a chance.
    -   When you actually _do_ get to fight her in the sequel's Coliseum, her main battle strategy is to summon some protection, focus on slapping around either Serah or Noel, sacrifice her mooks, then use her Limit Break, which is called _Sadistic Surge_. No, really.
-   The Dressed-Like-A-Dominatrix Fraulein Luminaev of _Ginga Ojousama Densetsu Yuna_. In the translation patch, one of the things she will say when struck is "Oooh, yes!"
-   _God of War (PS4)_: The final boss utterly revels in getting hurt, because he's been subjected to total sensory deprivation for a century, and the curse has just been broken. He likes feeling pain because it's the first thing he's felt for a long while.
-   I-no from _Guilty Gear_ seems to take her hits the wrong way...
    -   Raven is this even moreso, to the point where it's a part of his gameplay. His special "Give It To Me Right Here" has him pose in a mocking fashion and hitting him during this time raises an excitement gauge that powers up his specials, on top of the inflicted damage recovering over time. He also looks _pleased_ when he's a victim of instant kill moves, whereas everyone else tends to wear a distinct Oh, Crap! expression (It helps that he's immortal). Despite this, he's fundamentally a better person then the aforementioned I-no and only displays his psychotic persona in battle.
-   Tormentors and Lacerators in _Might and Magic: Heroes VI_, minions of the Demon Lord of Pain. They grow more violent whenever they inflict or take damage, and use their own broken bones, which stick out of their flesh, as stabbing weapons to impale their foes.
-   In _Killing Floor_'s story, the Gorefast enemy is this, wishing to both inflict and take as much pain as it possibly can. It seems the Scrake took lessons from it, as well — it was meant to be the ultimate Combat Medic, but it became more interested in causing pain rather than healing it.
-   _Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep_: Vanitas's in-game battle quotes include such gems as "Suffer!" and "Show me anguish!" And that's not even getting into the fact that he laughs like crazy after Aqua beats him senseless in Radiant Garden.
-   _King of Fighters_:
    -   Vice fills in this trope, and how. The infamous "she wolf" posture and moans she often has as her intro pose say all.
    -   Shen Woo is implied to be this, or at least to enjoy fighting women like these. As he tells to Vice herself:
-   In _Knights of the Old Republic_, you can run into a bunch of mercenaries on the planet Manaan, one of which is an Iridonian. One of his fellow mercenaries describes his distaste for the Iridonians, saying "Those savages keep hacking at a fallen foe even after death, mutilating the corpse out of pure blood lust." This coming from a Mandalorian.
-   _League of Legends_ has a few funny twists on the trope:
    -   Dr. Mundo grew up with an insane pain tolerance and an unbelievably misguided idea of what being a doctor is as a result of being experimented on by abusive asylum orderlies. He takes pain with stride, if not ticklish glee, and butchers people to death thinking he's "practicing medicine" on them. In-game, this is reflected by how he's one of the few champions who needs to Cast from Hit Points, but is also one of the tankiest juggernauts in the game.
    -   Olaf combines this with Death Seeker as he's a warrior who _desperately_ wants to die a glorious death in battle and throws himself at anything that looks like it will give it to him, with his "problem" being that because he's so strong, he always wins and survives. When playable, Olaf gains exponential bonus damage the lower on health he is, requiring players to endure damage and flirt with death just like he would to claim victory.
-   The titular villain from _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_ exhibits this in its fights.
-   Nifilhema of _Lusternia_, which is appropriate for a demonic incarnation of both pain and lust. She's peeled back strips of her own flesh and holds them perpetually taut with silver hook piercings, and delights in the Cold-Blooded Torture of her angelic counterparts and her own followers. Magnagoran players who follow her teachings are encouraged to become combat sadomasochists too.
-   In the second _Manhunt_ game, the Pervs are an entire gang of these guys.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . They dress up in animal costumes and gimp suits, and the level they're featured in is a BDSM club, complete with a "Dungeon" where they torture people to death to satisfy their own fiendish pleasures, Hostel style.
-   Haqua from _Marco & the Galaxy Dragon_ is a downplayed example. She believes the source of her power comes from bullying others or being bullied herself, and intentionally antagonizes people in order to power up. When the people of Gold Cord prove too nice to do either, she finds herself stumped.
-   Jack from the _Mass Effect_ trilogy. As a child, she was locked in a Cerberus facility that was trying to make her into the most powerful biotic ever. To test her strength, she was made to fight other children. To motivate her, she was given a cocktail of drugs to make her feel good. If asked about it, she says "I still get warm feelings during a fight" and shivers pleasurably.
-   Grenade Man in _Mega Man 8_ is _made_ of this trope. He _giggles_ when you hit him, shouts _"oh yeah!"_ when you deflect his own Flash Bombs back at him with the Thunder Claw, and yells _"that felt good!"_ when he _explodes_.
-   There's the infamous Cyborg Ninja battle in _Metal Gear Solid._ "Hurt me more!"
    -   Vamp.
    -   Forms the cornerstone of Big Boss and Kaz's "physical relationship" in _Peace Walker_. They're two best friends who punch each other unconscious as a form of affection.
    -   Raiden in _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_ becomes this with his Jack the Ripper persona.
    -   The Diamond Dogs aboard Mother Base in _Metal Gear Solid V_. They seem to love getting beaten senseless by Venom Snake, and sometimes even asking for him to "squeeze harder" while in a chokehold.
-   Megabeth in _Super Monday Night Combat_ sometimes giggles like an excited schoolgirl when taking damage. It seems to trigger fairly often when she's being _impaled_ by the assassin's katana.
-   King Gallon, one of the final bosses of _Odin Sphere_, is the victim of a rather ghastly transformation. Not only can he heal any injury, but every sensation he feels gets turned into pleasure.
-   According to the official _Persona 4_ magazines, Yosuke might be this. When Yukiko hits him (to snap him out of confusion), it is strongly implied that he becomes sexually aroused as a result. He gets embarrassed about it once the confusion wears off.
-   _Prince of Persia: Warrior Within_ has female enemies that say things like "Hit me harder prince" and "There's so much pleasure in pain" during combat.
    -   A Good Bad Bug turns the otherwise monstrous Dahaka into one as well, due to a glitch that loads Shadee's voice clips during the chase by mistake. It is frigging hilarious.
-   Aran Ryan from _Punch-Out!!_ on the Wii seems to be this. He is _far_ too much into the whole 'people getting hit in the face thing' thing, laughing madly with every punch he takes, always sporting a gigantic Slasher Smile every time he lands a hit, and being an Ax-Crazy Blood Knight bar none. He'll punch himself between rounds for lack of anything better to do (even more disturbing when it's revealed in his opening cutscene that he's hidden _horseshoes_ in his gloves). Finally, when you _do_ beat him, his expression in the challenge room isn't humbled or sad like many of the others, but a slightly worrying look of _gratification._
    
    **Aran Ryan:** "Fighting's like breathing, Mac!"  
    **Aran Ryan:** "Keep hitting me, I love it!"
    
-   The Assassin, a very minor yet memorable character of the fan game _Rakenzarn Tales_ is this. An Ax-Crazy Blood Knight Professional Killer and Knight of Cerebus. The more hurt she is during a battle, the more excited and bloodthirsty she becomes. She finds a disturbing pleasure in her own pain. The heroes didn't nickname her "Little Miss Crazy" for nothing...
-   In _Rimworld_, colonists who have "Bloodlust" and "Masochist" traits are basically this. They can get ecstatic from killing enemies and receiving pain from their own injuries.
-   _River City Girls_: The wrestler enemy Oscar. "Never took a knife edge chop he didn't sadistically enjoy."
-   _Sakura Dungeon_: The Whip Wielder takes pleasure from both S&M and battle. After you capture her, Yomi uses this trait against her.
-   Akechi Mitsuhide from _Sengoku Basara_ is just as bad, moaning in pleasure and delight every time he's injured... Also, "quench my thirst with your blood and tears!"
    -   In the anime he's even worse. Being burned alive only seems to make him orgasm.
-   _Senran Kagura_: The Hebijo ninja Ryōna is this in spades. Her perverted lust for wanting to experience pain can ascend into disturbing levels of squick sometimes.
    -   Haruka has a little bit of this going for her as well, as she seems to enjoy getting stripped a little too much.
    -   Ibuki also shows shades of this from time to time.
-   Ivy and Voldo in the _Soul Series_. Ivy carries a whip and tends towards a sadistic attitude (after strangling her opponent with her whip during a throw in the first game, she asks, "Do you want more?", or alternately shouts "You filth!"), while Voldo, though less loquacious than Ivy, can moan almost pleasurably when taking damage. Both dress the part in their primary costumes.
-   The Dullahan in _Soul Sacrifice_ was one of these. He actively encouraged his opponents to hurt him, wrapping himself in chains just to make it easier. He wasn't any healthier outside of battle — his favorite pastime was having his servants _torture him_. Eventually, he reached the point where nothing short of actually _dying_ could give him pleasure anymore... and that was when the Chalice appeared.
-   Darkside!Jaesa in _Star Wars: The Old Republic_; this trope is a major indicator of just how far she's gone.
-   _Sunset Overdrive_: The Sadomasochist Amp:
    
    The less health you have, the more damage you do.
    
-   Sapphine Grace from Super Robot Wars series. She has a habit of reaching organism when her mech gets hit, which gets cranked up in _Super Robot Wars Alpha Gaiden_, where voice acting exists.
    -   Also The Edel Bernal, the last boss of _Super Robot Wars Z_ Who sounds equally orgasmic attacking and being attacked.
-   _Super Street Fighter IV_ has none other than Juri Han. She laughs, moans, and says "that felt good, didn't it" during the "climax" of her Ultra Combo.
    -   Vega is more of The Fighting Narcissist, but some adaptations give him a whiff of this. Specially when he fights Chun-Li in The Animated Movie.
-   _Tales of Vesperia_: ZAGI. Oh God, Zagi.
-   _Undertale_:
    
    _"that expression you are wearing... ...you're really kind of a freak, huh?"_
    
-   _Valkyria Chronicles_ has Homer as the masochist, to the point where he gets bonuses in combat when seriously hurt, and is quite happy when Edy punches him. Both times, he sounds like he's having an orgasm. Jane features as the sadist, and reading the profiles after finishing the game says that she went on to be a drill instructor known as "Sadistic Jane".
-   _Covenant of the Plume_ doesn't have many masochists, but you can recruit a few sadistic Token Evil Teammates. Liselotte stands out — if she manages to kill someone with her special attack, her Bond One-Liner is "Wasn't that the _best_ you've ever had?"
-   Kyojiro in _Way of the Samurai 2_ uses a serrated sword to inflict extra pain on her opponents and has a habit of drinking blood.
-   The Succubus summoned by Warlocks in _World of Warcraft_ wear brandished whips, make constant Double Entendres and moan with pleasure when she attacks or get hit, regardless of the summoner or mob's gender. They even make loud orgasm noises when they die.
    -   There's also the Priest Shadow spec, which revolves around causing immense pain and has a talent called Masochism, in which a sufficient amount of damage taken will give the user a burst of mana.
    -   Death Knights have this as an in story (though not mechanically shown) cost of their powers. They must regularly cause injury to other beings or be wracked with terrible pain themselves.
-   Albedo from _Xenosaga_ _really_ enjoys pain and fighting... He even lampshades it when he heals himself during a fight:
    
    **Albedo:** This pain... It's so good... SO GOOD!!!
    
-   _Yakuza 0_ has Homare Nishitani, who goes past Blood Knight and straight into The Interplay of Sex and Violence. Majima can't decline the fights, and Nishitani gleefully peppers the encounters with violently homoerotic commentary the whole time (including describing his eagerness to fight as a "blood chubby"). It doesn't even need to be during combat, just _mentioning_ the chance for a fight is enough to set him off on a violence-boner tangent.
    
    **Nishitani:** (_flat on his back, bruised and scuffed after getting kicked, punched, and stabbed in the leg_) "Ah... that as fuckin' amazing. Never felt this way in all my life."
    
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum_, several of Marik and Yami Marik's lines imply that they're this.
    
    **Marik:** (hit with a heavy attack) _Nice_... it's no _fun_ if you don't fight back...  
    **Yami Marik:** (hit with a heavy attack) Ha ha ha! Pharaoh... Keep it coming!
    

    Web Comics 

-   _Bittersweet Candy Bowl_, Alejandro took two of Lucy's kicks, had his teeth smashed into each other hard enough to chip one and draw blood, and was still okay enough to beat Lucy senseless before Mike came back, smashing his face into an alley floor and still not stopping him. It took Mike and Lucy together to start the example in No-Holds-Barred Beatdown. And he beat Mike before all this happened.
-   Nyarai from _Furry Fight Chronicles_ shows signs of this in Chapter 17, as she is more than happy to get hurt as long as she gets the chance of hurting her opponent back afterwards.
-   _Girl Genius_:
-   _Homestuck_:
-   Richard from _Looking for Group_. Granted, he is meant to be undead, and therefore probably can't feel anything, so it could just be amusement at people attempting to hurt him.
-   _S.S.D.D._ has Super Soldiers known as "Gigglers". They get injected with drugs when they kill an opponent, making them cackle with delight. It also seems that they're not normally capable of feeling pain at all, which leads to one individual "Giggler" who was captured by another faction while still in his Uterine Replicator and allowed to grow up normally as an experiment spending a lot of time testing it out when the nerve-blocks are finally disabled, much to the disquiet of the other characters.
-   _Weak Hero_:
    -   Wolf is obsessed with fighting and gets a kick out of beating his opponents to a pulp. His loss to Gray and his fight between Giju also make it clear, however, that violence itself is what he finds fun, and he doesn't care if _he's_ the one who receives it. This is also shown in the way he treats battles as a series of "turns", where he'll happily take a beating so long as he can return it without interruption.
    -   Dongha makes it clear how much he loves fighting when he goes around starting brawls for no reason. Then, in his fight with Alex, he constantly talks about how fun it is to beat up someone who acts so persistently. When Alex gets the upper hand and hits him with a rapid flurry of punches, Dongha starts screaming joyfully for more, which disturbs Alex so much that it gives Dongha the opportunity to flip the tables again.
-   _Yet Another Fantasy Gamer Comic_ has Arachne, who is generally Too Kinky to Torture and find being put in danger arousing in any circumstances.

-   _Adventure Time_:
    -   Marceline is a minor case. While she doesn't outright enjoy pain, it makes her nostalgic of the days when she wasn't a nigh-invincible queen of vampires. Those days were when she was _a little kid_. Yeah... says a lot about her, doesn't it?

At one point she punches out Walt, Larry and Giner, then moans with pleasure when the collar shocks her.
-   One-shot villain Spike from _Mighty Max_ is effectively Nigh-Invulnerable, and so greets attempts to hurt him with laughter and mockery. A flashback to when he attacked Norman's village as a child shows that Norman's father, Erlik, kicked Spike's feet out from under him and caused him to fall face-first into a pile of branches, resulting in multiple sticks impaling his face. Spike promptly got up laughing at the idea that he could be hurt with "twigs", snapping off one length of branch and ramming it into his own nose to emphasize his indifference to pain.
    
    **Spike:** _\[face impaled deeply on multiple branches\]_ You think you can hurt me with a twig? You can't hurt me! _\[shoves branch up nose\]_ Feels good!
