"Krusty Krab is unfair! Mr. Krabs is in there! Standing at the concession! Plotting his oppression!"

**Quagmire:** What do we want?  
**Other Pilots:** FAIR WAGES!  
**Quagmire:** When do we want it?  
**Other Pilots:** ORIGINALLY NOW, BUT IT'S BEEN DELAYED UNTIL 9:40 DUE TO WEATHER IN PHILLY!

This is an episode where a character or group of characters, feeling overworked, underpaid, or underappreciated, decides to take action against their bosses and go on strike. Common elements of a strike, such as picket lines with sign-carrying workers, tense negotiations by union bosses, the company hiring "goons" or using Dirty Cops to break the strike with billy clubs, and "scabs" (replacement workers) may ensue. Most of these episodes tend to side with the group going on strike, especially when the boss is a Corrupt Corporate Executive. Other times though it may portray both sides as equally flawed, putting extra emphasis on a compromise moral.

The Strike may be a result of a Weird Trade Union if examples come from people who usually wouldn't strike. If it's local sanitation workers who are striking, and garbage piles up around town as a result, it's also a case of Why We Need Garbagemen.

It should be noted this has nothing to do with bowling or baseball, except in the rare instance the work is talking about an actual work stoppage by the players. Nor is this about TV Strikes, although they may overlap if they occur around the same time. It's also not the first half of _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_; those are "Strike _Gundam_ Episodes".

The strike ends when a new teacher, Croix, demonstrates that her previously forbidden Magitek devices are easily capable of both keeping the school running and satisfying the fairies' needs. As well they might, since she instigated the energy crisis that led to the strike in the first place.
-   _Shounen Hollywood_ had its members strike out towards the end of the second season in reaction to former member Shima Hayamizu offering to reform and advertise for the group in exchange for destroying Hollywood Tokyo.
