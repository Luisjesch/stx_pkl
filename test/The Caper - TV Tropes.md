Told from the criminal viewpoint, a group plans and executes an elaborate crime. The criminals are usually more rounded than the opposition, or at least more colorful. When the crime is a robbery, the plot is called a "heist."

The Caper is more action-oriented than The Con. It often revolves around a brilliant Gentleman Thief who Just Got Out of Jail hoping to do One Last Job, usually by Putting the Band Back Together (in comedies, a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits). However, almost any type of protagonist can be found planning a caper, often out of necessity when their usual methods won't work or aren't available. If one or more of the crew works for the target, it's an Inside Job. Can lead to Just Like Robin Hood as a way of Caper Rationalization. The crew's leader will inevitably present the job as A Simple Plan that is certain to go off the rails due to unexpected variables. Optionally, the leader may have a Plan B, but it can _only_ be used as a last resort, as it involves going loud, or doing something _very_ dangerous, and that would otherwise defeat the whole purpose of an elaborate heist.

The members of a Caper Crew fall into standard roles. For targets, see Bank Robbery, Armed Blag, The Casino, Train Job. See also Impossible Mission, The Infiltration and Double Caper. Not to be confused with The Cape. Can contain an A-Team Montage or Avengers Assemble sequence. Heist Episode is for when works that are normally not about thievery pay homage to the Caper genre for an installment, usually by having the characters steal something. Contrast Caught Up in a Robbery.

Not to be confused with the webseries _Caper_. One of the reasons heist films may be so popular is that conceptually, pulling off a heist and making a movie are pretty much the same thing.

-   _The Mona Lisa_: Infamously, in 1911 the Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre in broad daylight. The plan was simple and brazen: The thief dressed as a maintenance man, removed the painting for "cleaning," and simply walked out with it under his coat.

-   The _Nick Velvet_ stories by Edward D. Hoch frequently require Nick to pull off an elaborate caper in order to steal something worthless; which is why he charges so much for his services.
-   _Parker_: Each book is divided into four sections of roughly equal length, subdivided into shorter chapters. The first and second sections are written in a limited third-person perspective focused entirely on Parker as he plans and undertakes a robbery or heist with colleagues. The second section ends on a cliffhanger, as Parker is betrayed — often injured and left for dead. Section three shifts to the perspective of Parker's opponents, usually in flashback as they plan and execute their double-cross. Section four returns to Parker's perspective as he survives the plot against him and sets out for revenge.
-   Played With in _River of Teeth_. The story involves Houndstooth assembling a Caper Crew of the usual suspects and the target is a corrupt businessman running several casino boats, however, the goal is not to rob him but to remove thousands of feral hippos from the lake where the aforementioned corrupt businessman is feeding cheating customers to them. Preferably without him noticing until it's too late. The _operation_, as Houndstooth insists on calling it, is also sanctioned by the federal government. This stops none of the crew members from calling the entire thing a _caper_ and treating it as such, much to Houndstooth's annoyance.

The files become both an additional target and a way of gaining access to Villachor.
-   _The Supervillainy Saga_ book, _Tales of Supervillainy: Cindy's Seven_, has Cindy Wachkowski AKA Red Riding Hood assembling a team to rob the Dragon King's The Casino. The Dragon King is a literal dragon and the richest being on Earth.
-   The novel _Thunderball_ had SPECTRE doing this — rather than an organised crime Cosmopolitan Council, they were a gang of highly-professional criminals who were planning the Empty Quiver heist as One Last Job.
-   The _Vlad Taltos_ novels often have at least elements of this. _Jhereg_ and _Yendi_ are straight examples.
-   All of the _Wyatt_ novels centre around a heist of some kind: usually high value and easily convertible to cash. Wyatt prefers to steal cash, but will also steal other easily transportable valuables, like jewels or art. These heists never run as smoothly as he would like.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Every single episode of _The A-Team_.
-   _Blake's 7_. Given that the eponymous Seven are mostly a group of ex-cons that Blake rescued from a penal colony this trope comes up in several episodes, ranging from stealing a Federation decoder in "Seek-Locate-Destroy" to robbing a gold shipment in the final season — by which time their idealistic leader has long since gone and the Seven are little better than Space Pirates acting under the guise of revolutionaries.
-   _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_ has a heist episode usually once a season, generally on Halloween (but subject to change), with the squad planning to "steal" (i.e., retrieve, since they're cops and a real heist is obviously a crime) certain precious items owned by any one of their number, previously agreed-upon.

    -   The season 2 finale, "Eye of the Beholder", is a classic caper plot in which the team steals one of the Crown Jewels. Until the end, when it turns out that the entire point of the caper was to con a bunch of people into buying fakes...
    -   In an episode in season 5, _New Recruits_, Hustle pulls a similar "caper" again. This time, they're conning their mark, who had been advertising a completely foolproof security system, into thinking they'd stolen a painting. Really, they just hid it behind a false wall.
    -   In the season 4 finale, "Bid Daddy Calling", Albert makes the fatal mistake of visiting a casino he had been banned from years ago. When an old friend inadvertently reveals this to the casino's new owner, mafia boss Johnny Maranzano, Albert is beaten up for disrespecting his father's ban against the grifter. Upon hearing of this, the crew rush to Vegas, with Danny intent in making Johnny suffer by hitting his prized gem — a fruit machine made in tribute to his late father, which holds a $5 million jackpot. Despite tough security measures, the crew learn that the weak point is a large fish tank which is housed in front of the safe holding the jackpot, allowing it to be seen on display. Danny learns that while the heist must be perfect, they must also outwit Johnny's mafia connections, as it will spell trouble for the crew if they are caught.
-   _The Knights Of Prosperity,_ originally titled _Let's Rob Mick Jagger._
-   Children's sitcom _The Legend of Dick and Dom_ has an episode called "The Heist"; the heroes have to rob a bank to get back the MacGuffin that the corrupt manager has stolen. Features cunning disguises, a decoy robbery and tunnel digging. And Creepy Twins, just for fun.
-   _Leverage_ uses this trope as its main premise often mixing it with The Con.
-   _Lupin_: the protagonist, who styles himself after _Arsène Lupin_, pulls off a heist to steal a necklace that belonged to Marie-Antoinette in the first episode.

-   _Tales of the Tinkerdee_: The whole plot of the pilot boils down to this, albeit taking place in a fairytale kingdom, and most of the screentime is the Wicked Witch attempting to remain undetected: the expensive birthday presents that Taminella is in the castle to try to steal in the first place only receive about a minute of screentime!
-   The FX character drama _Thief_ starred Andre Braugher as Nick Atwater, a master thief and leader of a Caper Crew, balancing his personal life with the planning of a major heist.

-   A historical documentary used this format to explore theories on how an Egyptian pyramid was broken into and looted during ancient times. It gave the theoretical participants nicknames like The Mastermind, The Foreigner and The Engineer to illustrate the various social backgrounds and skill sets the people involved would need to have to pull off such a crime. In particular it theorized that The Engineer was probably blackmailed or coerced into participating since he would have been of a much higher social strata than the rest of the crew and the one with most to lose if caught. The show also regularly reminded the audience that the punishment for such a crime in Ancient Egypt was to be burned alive.

    Music 

-   Barenaked Ladies' "Bank Job" is the heist leader dressing down a member of his crew after a (hilariously) failed caper.

-   In the German "Stimmungslied" (read: song that is usually only sufferable with alcohol levels of at least 2 promille) "Sauerkraut und Bier" the caper ends as epic fail since the loot consists of, well, sauerkraut and beer.

    Pinball 

-   This is the main plot of _Safe Cracker_ - you must break into the vault and crack the safe contained within.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The core gameplay loop of _Blades in the Dark_ (as well as most games under the Forged in the Dark umbrella) is centered on a caper (dubbed "Score" in the game) of some sort: the Crew looks for a criminal opportunity to advance their goals (even if it's just to earn some coin), chooses their approach (guns-blazing, stealthy, black-tie, etc.), rolls for the initial position, and then uses the flashback mechanic to retroactively prepare for whatever complications arise. After completing (or abandoning) the score, the crew enters a downtime where they lay low and enjoy some R&R before going right back to looking for the next opportunity.
-   _Burgle Bros._ is a map exploration game where the players are members of a team trying to pull off a heist without getting caught. Together, they must explore the building (represented by a grid of initially face-down tiles for each floor), find and crack all the safes, and escape to the roof.
-   A game of _Shadowrun_ generally follows the structure of The Caper in a future urban fantasy setting, with a party of a combat specialist, a hacker, a con man, and a mage planning an elaborate theft of a highly guarded target from a corporation, on the behest of a mysterious paymaster.

    Video Games 

-   The _City of Heroes_ summer event mission "Casino Heist" is based on the tropes of The Caper, with the players taking the parts of the Caper Crew.
-   _Conker's Bad Fur Day_: The final level has Conker breaking into the Feral Reserve Bank to steal the cash for Don Weasel.
-   The entire Act 1 of _Cyberpunk 2077_ is centered around the heist to steal the Relic biochip from Yorinobu Arasaka. In preparation, V diligently studies the recording of Yorinobu's penthouse suite and retrieves a Militech recon bot together with Jackie, while Dex The Fixer and T-Bug the netrunner prepare costumes and electronic countermeasures. The heist goes swimmingly right up to the point where V and Jackie grab the biochip, when Saburo Arasaka himself, Yorinobu's father and the most powerful man in the world, suddenly shows up to berate his wayward son... who promptly strangles him to death, takes over as Arasaka patriarch, and puts the whole hotel on lockdown. T-Bug manages to get V and Jackie out, but has her brains fried by Arasaka netrunners, while Jackie is mortally wounded in the ensuing shootout. The Relic's containment is also damaged, so V ends up having to slot it into their own head... right before Dex decides to cut his losses and shoots V in said head. V survives, but the Relic is now permanently fused with their brain and slowly killing them, kicking off Act 2...
-   The _Dragon Age II_ expansion "Mark of the Assassin" plays out very similarly to Kasumi's mission. You join up with a Loveable Rogue, infiltrate a high-class party, find your way past the guards to your host's vault...and then it turns out Tallis is actually a Qunari agent. After that, it shifts gears to a kind of medieval fantasy spy drama.
-   The final quest for the Thieves Guild in _The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion_ is called "The Ultimate Heist" — rightly so, because it sees you breaking into the Emperor's Palace and stealing one of the titular Elder Scrolls. The preparations for this mission comprise the three penultimate quests that you perform for the Grey Fox himself.
-   The Big Dig quest in _Fallout 4_ has you and a few others tunnel from Goodneighbor to the Diamond City vault in order to rob Mayor McDonough blind although the end of the quest reveals that you're not stealing from _that_ Mayor McDonough, but instead his brother, Hancock, the mayor of Goodneighbor.
-   The _Fallout: New Vegas_ DLC Dead Money, where the player (who's been strapped with an Explosive Leash) is forced to help the insane Father Elijah loot the Sierra Madre casino with the help of three other NPCs, one of which has been trying to rob said casino for two centuries.
-   _Grand Theft Auto_
    -   _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_, in a clear homage to _Ocean's Eleven_, has CJ robbing a vegas casino with a colourful group of characters (Its GTA, they're always colourful)
    -   _Grand Theft Auto V_ takes this premise and runs with it - not only are there several heists in the game (and later on, a variety of unique heists were added to the Online portion of the game), each one has a variety of missions associated with it to prepare for said heist. For example, when the team plans to rob a jewelry store, they send in a guy to case the joint and take pictures of the various security systems. Once they have the pictures, the player has to make a decision on whether to go in "loud and dumb" with guns blazing, or recruit a hacker and steal some knockout gas, an exterminator's van, and dress up as exterminators so that people won't question their gas masks. You also need to hire a crew to help you with the support stuff - the more competent they are, the bigger take they demand, but the less likely they are to fail and drop their loot. And finally, after all that, comes the heist itself.
-   _The Heist: Monaco_: You are the leader of a gang of thieves who want to steal the crown jewels and take revenge on an old ally.
-   Pulling off capers is the primary focus of Fragile Alliance, the multiplayer mode of the _Kane & Lynch_ games.
-   Kasumi Goto's loyalty mission in _Mass Effect 2_ is framed as a heist, with her and Shepard infiltrating a party hosted by one Donovan Hock to recover a graybox belonging to her former partner, Keiji Okuda, which is stored in his heavily secure vault. Once you complete enough tasks to break in, the pair are caught, leading into a typical shoot-out segment to escape the scene.
-   _Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine_ is essentially this trope as the High Concept for an entire game.
-   _Noel The Mortal Fate_: Episode 6 takes place in a casino with Noel and the team planning to shut down and cut off Burrows' funding.
-   _PAYDAY_
    -   _PAYDAY: The Heist_ is "Heist Film: The Game". Hell, the central bank heist is a huge homage to _Heat_.
    -   _PAYDAY 2_ expands on this further. Containing everything, from bank robberies, to rigging elections, to double crossing meth dealers before a bridge showdown, the game covers numerous heist and action tropes (and even adds several more references to _Heat_ and other caper classics).
-   _Piratez_: The "Mansion of Anguish". Your team is to "conduct reconnaissance" (an excuse to wear maid's outfits) in a seemingly never-ending mansion<small>◊</small>.
-   Parodied in one _Saints Row 2_ mission where an elaborate plan is thought up for a heist, but the plan is scrapped in favor of just walking through the front door and shooting everyone. Also doubles as a Shout-Out/Take That! to _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ below, as the initial plan, as described, is similar to CJ's plan, before Gat and the Boss scrap the idea for just shooting everybody.
-   The premise of the _Sly Cooper_ series is a gang of thieves planning heists against master criminals, with each target requiring preparation, planning, and sometimes improvisation.
-   The Imperial Agent's storyline in _Star Wars: The Old Republic_ includes planning and executing a caper of the top-security facility operated by the Star Cabal in the very heart of the Republican prison planet of Belsavis. Complicating matters is the facility's murderous AI protector that can strike at you pretty much anywhere on the planet and the fact that for your Caper Crew, you have to rely on a bunch of career criminals previously locked up there for life, most of whom naturally turn on you the moment your arrangement is complete.
    -   Its predecessor, _Knights of the Old Republic_ also required a pair of heists at the end of the first act, in order to steal the starship needed to get off Taris and away from the Sith from a crime boss, and the security codes to get past the blockade from a Sith military base.
-   _Tales from the Borderlands_: Rhys loves to imagine heist scenarios where everyone on the team plays their role and they pull off their objective without a hitch. The start of episode 4 plays out just like a Hollywood scenario, complete with him patting himself on the back for doing such a good job as the mastermind.
-   Some of the subplots of _Thief_ enter into this trope; Garrett sometimes goes through elaborate plans over multiple game levels to enter secure locations.
-   _The Clue!_ is based around planning an executing a succession of these.

    Web Animation 

-   Strong Bad and The Cheat of _Homestar Runner_ occasionally engage in capers. These ventures rarely turn out to be successful.
    -   In the Strong Bad Email "caper", Strong Bad gets mad at The Cheat for screwing up an attempt to steal the Jumble puzzle from Homestar's morning paper, but then later feels bad about it, which leads to him performing a song about how he's glad The Cheat is not dead.

Secondly, they're operating in the territory of rival Marigold Gang and _poaching_ that supplier, necessitating stealth and discretion to avoid getting caught on enemy turf. Thirdly, they fail rather spectacularly at that last part, and find themselves on the wrong end of a Car Chase Shootout with Marigold's top three Hired Guns.
-   A few times by the heroes in _RWBY_:
    -   In Volume 6, Team RWBY and JNPR pull off a caper to try and steal an airship so they can get into Atlas. The plan goes completely lopsided when Adam Taurus uses that moment to get his revenge on Blake, preventing her from doing her part.
    -   In Volume 8, the teams pull off a better plan to fool Ironwood and get into Atlas' vault without surrendering Penny. Helping things here is having the assistance of Emerald, Winter and Marrow.

    Web Comics 

    Web Original 

-   The lads and gents of Achievement Hunter have done regular "Heist" videos during their Let's Play series of _Grand Theft Auto V_.

-   _Rick and Morty_: "One Crew Over the Crewcoo's Morty" take this trope to its logical extent: the duo attend a convention dedicated to heists and, after pulling one over on a renowned heist artist, Rick's Heistotron AI goes rogue and begins assimilating the universe into a crew for his next caper, which turns out to be stealing entire planets. The end of the episode reveals the whole thing was Rick's convoluted plot to get Morty to lose faith in his pitch for a heist movie to Netflix so he won't give up going on adventures with Rick.
