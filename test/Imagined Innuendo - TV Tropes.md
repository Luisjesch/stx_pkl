**Steve Rogers:** What about you and Stark? How do I know you two haven't been... "fonduing?"  
_\[Beat\]_  
**Agent Carter:** You still don't know a bloody thing about women...  
**Howard Stark:** Fondue's just cheese and bread, my friend.

What happens when, in-story, Alice starts interpreting statements by Bob to be a variant of Double Entendre. Most common if Alice has either been given misinformation by a third party, or if she's simply not intelligent enough to realize what it is that Bob is actually referring to. Almost always, Hilarity Ensues.

Can result in I Didn't Mean to Turn You On.

Not to be confused with the Accidental Innuendo, where it's the _audience_ who got the wrong impression. Compare and contrast Innocent Innuendo and Mistaken for Flirting. See also Calling Me a Logarithm.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Dark Gathering_, Yayoi asks Eiko to "take care" of Keitarou (Eiko's boyfriend), who is stressed out because of a previous battle. It's ambiguous what she meant, but Eiko clearly thinks she's suggesting having Sex for Solace.
-   One of these kicks off _Hanamaru Kindergarten_. In the first episode, one of the main characters, a 4-year-old girl, is standing alone along on the side of the street. Another main character, a male kindergarten teacher, comes by on his bike and asks the little girl, "Excuse me, Ojou-chan. What are you doing here?" "Ojou-chan" essentially means "Miss" or "Little lady". Not an unusual way to address a young girl whom one does not know. Anzu, the girl, has a very active imagination, however, and she jumps to the conclusion that he's _hitting on her_. He turns out to be her teacher at kindergarten and the misunderstanding persists. Hilarity Ensues.

    Comedy 

-   When he isn't doing redneck jokes, Jeff Foxworthy has a bit about That Guy Who Can Turn Any Comment Into a Sexual Innuendo.
    
    **Girl:** I need to have my tires rotated.  
    **That Guy:** I'd sure like to rotate her tires, uh huh, uh huh.
    

    Comic Books 

-   _Robin_: In the first miniseries, Tim gets a fright when Lady Shiva wakes him up at night for martial arts training, telling him that she'll bring him to a _"whole new world"_. Tim responds with _"Um... I don't think I'm ready for this"_. Lady Shiva then nonchalantly replied with a joke that they could do _that_ later, after the training.

    Fan Works 

-   Exaggerated in one particularly memetic _Touhou Project_ short comic by Bomber Grape, in which Remilia misinterprets completely innocuous actions by the girls around her as blatant sexual advances.
-   In the _Homestuck_ fan adventure _Alabaster: The Doomed Session_, Vamuin is so used to innuendo and phallic symbolism no one can stand him saying he's going to "introduce everyone". Even when he means it.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Captain America: The First Avenger_, Steve Rogers mistakes a mention of a "late-night fondue" as a reference to something sexual after he hears Howard Stark inviting Peggy out to have fondue. It's a while before anyone explains to him what fondue is.
-   The 1940 British Thriller _A Window in London_ has a scene where the protagonist, Peter Thompson (played by Sir Michael Redgrave) is describing a stabbing he thought he witnessed to a reporter:
    
    **Thompson:** I was looking out of the window on the underground, travelling overground... when I saw a man messing about with a girl.  
    **Reporter:** What?!  
    **Thompson:** He was trying to stick a knife into her.  
    **Reporter:** Ha, knife, I get you.
    
-   _Young Frankenstein_ has Frederick exclaim "What knockers!" as he helps Inga off the wagon. He was talking about the _actual_ door knockers.
-   Kurt in _Horrible Bosses_ is a bit sex-obsessed. At one point he sees a picture of Mrs. Harken and declares "I'd like to bend her over a barrel and show her the fifty states," prompting his friends to ask what he means. The only answer he can provide is "Y'know, it's in that movie." In one of the outtakes, he turns to the camera and announces "Well, it is now."

    Literature 

-   This happens in P. G. Wodehouse novels all the time. Bertie Wooster mistakenly creates the impression that he is proposing to/hitting on/in love with various women on a regular basis (when usually he is, in fact, trying to set her up with a friend). Most of the time they aren't particularly interested in Bertie, but end up accepting his "proposal" anyway, for one reason or another.
-   _Can You Spare a Quarter?_: Jamie originally assumes that Jason is Graham's boy (in the sense of Sex Slave or at least sex partner) and wonders whether Graham will still want him, but Graham assures him that he (Jason) isn't.
-   _The Northern Caves_ is about a Mind Screw Fictional Document also titled _The Northern Caves_. One passage seems to be describing a sexual seduction, but Aaron qualifies this by saying, "it's not clear to me whether I'm merely reading sexual connotations into strange phrase".
    
    _Sally went for Ws full exoteric crystal matrix as hard as graphene megavolts into his LIGHTNING FAST SPHEX transmission lost oh very good 100% on the full heavy_
    
-   In _The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror_, during a bout of sex, Molly promises to wash Theo's car. Theo assumes this is a euphemism for something, but confesses he doesn't know what it means. Molly explains it means exactly what she said.
-   A Running Gag in _A Song of Ice and Fire_ involves Shagga, son of Dolf, and his threats to cut people's "manhoods" off and feed them to goats. Shagga is in fact referring to beards when he says that, which Grandmaester Pycelle discovers to his dismay.
-   In _Hogfather_, Anaglypta Huggs is an upper middle-class Ankh-Morporkian who is interested in folk traditions, but determined to remove all coarseness and indelicacy from them, even if nobody can see it except her. Which is why her Hogswatch Wassailers sing "The Red Rosy Hen Greets the Dawn of the Day".
-   _The Ganymede Takeover_. Swesnegard is trying to tell his alien overlord that he planted a miniature Tracking Device in the hair of a journalist who was going to interview the Rebel Leader.
    
    **Swesnegard:** When that girl was in the hotel I took the liberty of patting her sweet little head.  
    **Mekkis:** I am not interested in your sexual depravity.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   In one episode of _Just Shoot Me!_, Finch switching around the "from" tags on birthday gifts for Elliot ends up switching a gag gift of sex toys (from a minor, male character) with a normal gift of video games (from Maya). Elliot is understandably uncertain when the woman who gave him video games asks if she can come to his house to "play with the present I gave you". Meanwhile he freaks out the guy who gave him the sex toys by inviting him over for "just us guys" playtime. The guy goes for it, though.
-   In _Glee_, Mercedes suspects that Kurt is gay...at least until the cheerleaders tell her he likes her. Then she interprets every time they hang out as a date. Unfortunately, her first instincts were correct.
    -   Happens again in Season Two between Kurt and Blaine. There's even a throwback to the above example after it all comes crashing down.
-   In _I Love Lucy_, Lucy goes to a job interview with Ricky in disguise. Unfortunately, Ricky can't really talk to women without sounding like he's propositioning them. When he asks to see her credentials, Lucy slaps him.
-   A "by proxy" example, if you will, as it was actually the radio that did it. In _'Allo 'Allo!_, a Britcom set in Occupied France during World War II, stealth French Resistance operative René is hiding a radio behind the bar in his Café. The radio begins spouting code phrases meant for resistance agents (usually gibberish like "Pierre enjoys riding his new bicycle") and this rouses the suspicions of German Wehrmacht Lieutenant Gruber. Gruber asks René who is saying these things, and René, wanting to keep the radio a secret, claims that he's the one who said them. Unfortunately for René, the next phrase to come out of the radio is "Listen very carefully, meet me behind the woodshed at one o'clock." Lieutenant Gruber interprets this as an overture for a homosexual tryst, and very eagerly and happily agrees to meet René at o'clock.
-   _Friends_ examples:
    -   In "The One Where Eddie Won't Go" Rachel reads a female-empowering, jargon-laced book, “Be Your Own Windkeeper,” which inspires her to push back on Ross’ demand that they leave for movie on time, resulting in this exchange:
        
        **Rachel:** How do you expect me to grow if you won’t let me blow?  
        **Ross:** You know I don’t... have a... have a problem with that...
        
    -   In "The One Where Chandler Can't Cry" as per the episode title the other Friends have discovered Chandler hasn't cried since his parents divorce in childhood, and start renting sad movies to try and see if any will make him cry. At the same time Joey and Ross discover that Phoebe is apparently a porn-star<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and they rent one of her films to prove it to the rest of the group. Which leads to this quote:
        
        **Monica:** _(noticing the bag Joey’s carrying)_ Oh great! Did you get a movie?  
        **Joey:** Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kind you’re gonna like.  
        **Chandler:** You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?  
        _(Joey and Ross exchange looks.)_  
        **Joey:** Sort of…
        
-   _Cheers_: In episode "Look Before You Sleep", Norm and Cliff are so vicariously wrapped up in Sam's sex life that they take his talk of killing silverfish as Double Entendres.
    
    **Sam:** I had silverfish all over my apartment last night.  
    **Cliff, Norm:** Ooh, silverfish!  
    **Sam:** Spent the whole night rolling up newspapers and swatting them.  
    **Cliff:** Oh, _kinky_.  
    **Sam:** It got so bad there, I started rubbing ammonia on the baseboard.  
    **Cliff:** Sammy, don't know what that means, but does she have a sister?
    
-   In one _Wings_ episode, Antonio (played by Tony Shalhoub) gleefully attempts to participate in stereotypical American male sex-humor with the guys just after the vixen seducing him beckons him to her room:
    
    **Antonio:** Oh, man. We're going to go upstairs and 'have sex' if you know what I mean.
    
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_:
    -   Given equal parts lampshading and subversion when Joel instructs the 'bots that the art of entendre "isn't so much _what_ you say, but _how_ you say it."
    -   Sometimes, the entendres are implied to be about to occur, but then avoided entirely, see _Riding With Death_, Where a spinning number dial gets to 69:
        
        **Servo:** Hey, guys, it's my favorite number! Woo-hoo!  
        **Mike:** What, 70?  
        **Servo:** Yeah, I love 70!
        
-   In one episode of _The Office (US)_, Michael asks if anyone wants some "man meat". Dwight then replies that he wants some, prompting Jim to announce "Michael, Dwight wants your man meat!" They were discussing ACTUAL meat (specifically the steaks Michael had just grilled) the whole time.
-   _Scrubs_: The first episode in which Sean appears has him tell Elliot he has something for her in his pants. Horrified by how that must have sounded, he clarifies by telling her he has a note from his physician in the pocket of his pants (he was wearing a hospital gown at the time).

    Puppet Shows 

-   In _It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie_, Rachel Bitterman's assistant assumes everything she says is a come on... eventually annoying her into saying "You know... not everything is an innuendo!" He then assumes that the word "innuendo" is itself an innuendo.

    Theatre 

-   _Much Ado About Nothing_: After Benedick has been convinced that Beatrice is in love with him, he interprets everything she says as an innuendo when she is sent to bid him "come to dinner." — ignoring the fact that this encounter is quite identical to every other encounter they've had where he saw no romantic subtext at all.

    Video Games 

-   Oghren makes some of these when talking about weapons in Party Banter in _Dragon Age: Origins_. Varric and Isabela also do this at one point in party banter in _Dragon Age II_.

    Visual Novels 

-   _C14 Dating_: Deandre is prone to picking up sexual meanings where none are intended, between his dirty mind, the Separated by a Common Language aspects of his New Zealand English compared to everyone else's (everyone else is either from the USA or learned it while living in Belgium) and the homonyms of some geology terms. The scene in which Melissa walks into a room while Hendrik (a Pungeon Master who is also the "oblivious to innuendos" type of asexual) is on the tail end of giving Deandre a long geology talk is a sight to behold.
-   Miu Iruma from _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_ is prone to reading too much into innocuous remarks and mistaking them for something sexual. To name some examples, in _Ultimate Talent Development Plan_, Hiyoko Saionji tells Miu to sew her mouth shut, but Miu believes that it is a kind of kink play. In _Love Across the Universe_, she mistakes Shuichi's suggestion to "get their bodies moving" to mean that they go to the gym storage room and see what happens next.

    Webcomics 

-   In _The Wolf at Weston Court_ there's a brief misunderstanding between Sorenson and the naive Elgin, when the latter comes home looking rather disheveled with Nova:

    **Sorenson:** I don't think your father would approve, sir.
    
-   _Sam & Fuzzy_ has an example of this when Fuzzy rattles off a string of euphemisms after Sam's first date with Candice.

-   Fun fact from _The Whiteboard_: "Brass nipples" are an actual component of a paintball marker, contrary to what Pirta thought when a customer at Doc's paintball shop asks for some.
-   Non-sexual example from _Bitmap World:_ When Harry comes home from his first day at the new office, he mentions that he had a bad day, "but at least I didn't have to wear a bunny suit." His wife assumed the phrase was some obscure computer jargon, but he was actually referring to one of his coworkers, who was dressed as a bunny.
-   In one _Skin Horse_ strip, Unity, phoning in a report to Sweetheart and Tip, says she's "out here punchin' the gator". Sweetheart doesn't even know what that means, and she clarifies "I totes cannot make this clearer. I am punchin' this 'gator. In the face." Sweetheart still isn't sure it's not a euphemism, and Tip recalls a Noodle Incident when Unity actually throttled a bishop.

    Web Original 

    Web Videos 

-   In _commodoreHUSTLE_, Alex invokes this in "Bros Clubbing Bros".
    
    **Alex:** Hey James, you wanna play Bros Twisting bros?  
    **James:** _\[backs away\]_ Is this another trick question?
    
-   _Kämpfer Abridged_. This happened in the anime as well, but poor Akane's confusion over Natsuru asking her to _come over_ to his house is more hilarious than it was.

    Western Animation

During a family visit, she explains that she feels genuinely ashamed of her actions and has accepted her sentence, but then Quagmire overhears what she's saying and gets the wrong idea.
    
    **Lois**: I guess I was stealing, because I was so sick of the same old routine. I felt like I had a void in my life. Like, there was a secret hole in me.  
    **Quagmire**: _(excitedly)_ Oh, God!  
    **Lois**: And I was trying to fill that hole with all kinds of expensive objects and things.  
    **Quagmire**: Oh, God!  
    **Lois**: And I felt wonderful with all those things filling that hole.  
    **Quagmire**: Oh, God!  
    **Lois**: I did this to myself, so I'm just gonna have to lay back and let the penal system teach me a lesson.  
    **Quagmire**: That one is also sexual!
    
-   "Pepper Ann, do you want breasts?". Her mother meant "chicken breasts" as she was making dinner, but Pepper Ann, who was going through gym-induced A-Cup Angst, reacted by covering her chest and yelling "WHAT?".
    -   In fact, that episode's plot was triggered by this trope, as Pepper Ann misunderstood her gym teacher's request for "support" as that she'd need a "bra", when she meant a "partner for the trampoline" (Trinket making inappropriate jokes early on didn't help matters).
-   _The Simpsons_ episode "Last Exit to Springfield" has Homer as a Union Boss, whom Mr. Burns tries to deal with by making innuendos toward bribery. Unfortunately for Burns, Homer ends up concluding that Burns is trying to seduce him.
