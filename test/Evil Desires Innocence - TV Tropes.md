Some Bad Girls want the Good Guys.

_"For once in my life, I will have something pure!"_

It is often the case that Being Evil Sucks.

Sometimes, those who pursue evil ends find themselves fully aware of the fact that they are fallen, that they are tainted. They see Good Feels Good while their pursuits are shallow, tawdry, and often emotionally or spiritually lacking.

Then they come across something that reminds them that Beauty Equals Goodness. A shining light in the darkness. Something that is pure, that is innocent. And they crave it. It is a stark reminder of what they have lost, and they desire it.

The desire could be sexual in nature, but in some cases, it could be purely platonic. In many cases, the interest could be the result of Because You Were Nice to Me. In some instances, this is a more familial sentiment.

They might see this as an opportunity to Corrupt the Cutie, though failing to realize that this will destroy the very quality that drew them in in the first place. In other instances, the innocent they fall in with becomes a Morality Pet.

Their infatuation may also be inspired by a Madonna-Whore Complex, and a young woman who captivates them may only be "innocent" in their imagination, idolizing her from afar. When he learns anything about her that taints this image, he will either ignore it to further his illusion, or fly into a rage and seek her immediate destruction for "deceiving" him.

If nothing else, they might choose to leave this shining light alone, or even protect it, leading to a Pet the Dog moment, showing that the villain is not necessarily beyond redemption.

Of course, not all emotional or moral issues are always clear-cut. An evil character who finds themselves drawn to an innocent may feel conflicted about it. In some cases, they might try to destroy the innocent party, either to remove the draw to a more moral stance or simply because that is the only thing they know. In other instances, The Dragon may take the opportunity to remove what they consider a distraction to their master, who they now see wavering due to the influence of an innocent character. Likewise, a villainous character may know that their involvement with the innocent character will mean destruction and/or ruin for one or both of them, but be unable to break away.

Though innocence in fiction tends to be represented by female characters, (such as The Ingenue, Rose-Haired Sweetie, and The Cutie) this is not inherently an Always Female trope, as there are plenty of villainesses who have interest in morally upright and pure male characters. That said, a villainous woman attracted to female characters doesn't necessarily play against this trope, either. Older works might even use the depiction of the Psycho Lesbian pursuing a girl of Incompatible Orientation (or have the latter drive the villainess to the former). See also Femme Fatale, The Vamp, and Lesbian Vampire for villainess roles associated with this trope. Male villains will run the gamut from Complete Monster, The Dragon, The Corruptor, and Noble Demon to The Heavy and The Brute.

This can be the logical inverse of All Girls Want Bad Boys, and together explain what the two characters see in each other. Also a case of Opposites Attract if it works out.

May overlap with And Now You Must Marry Me. Evil being evil, in more extreme cases, this might overlap with Rape as Drama.

In more positive examples, it might inspire a Heel–Face Turn/High-Heel–Face Turn. See also Too Good for This Sinful Earth. May overlap and/or result in Even Evil Has Loved Ones

Fans may create this dynamic with an Angel/Devil Shipping.

Compare and contrast Sex Is Evil, and I Am Horny.

In the case of the platonic/familial version, a related trope is Evil Parents Want Good Kids.

As a morality-centered trope, No Real Life Examples, Please!.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Inuyasha_: There once was a badly injured bandit named Onigumo, who was being cared for by a kind and gentle Miko named Kikyo. Onigumo lusted after Kikyo and offered himself up to the demons of the area in exchange for the ability to pursue her. Thus was born Naraku, who proceeded to pit Inu-Yasha and Kikyo against each other, since she had given her love to the half-demon. Later on, he finds that he cannot harm a resurrected Kikyo, as Onigumo's heart is still present within him, and still yearning for Kikyo.
-   _Moriarty the Patriot_: William views himself as an evil devil and Sherlock as a shining, innocent light and beacon of justice, and admires him for that—and wants to keep Sherlock that way. So when Sherlock murders someone in cold blood in front of him and he is forced to realize that he was wrong and that innocence doesn't exist, he has a bit of a meltdown to say the least.
-   _Wasteful Days of High School Girls_: Downplayed. Lily Somiya is an out-and-proud lesbian who, while not _inherently_ evil, has what she herself refers to as a "predator mode", which is her basest sexual desires. Those desires always seem to focus on Saku "Loli" Momoi, a high school girl who doesn't even know "where babies come from". While helping "Loli" fix her eyebrows after a shaving debacle, Lily has to sharply pinch her own cheek to avoid kissing the girl, which Lily describes as "keeping inner demons at bay", and when helping her with a bra fitting at a department store, she gives in to her "predator mode" and begins actively fondling "Loli"'s modest chest.
-   _The Way Of The House Husband_: Tatsu was a brutal thug and a feared member of the yakuza. Then Miku finds him injured and carries him to safety.

-   _Wolf's Rain_: Lord Darcia zigzags this trope with respect to Cheza. He does seek to possess her, but only because of her Healing Hands. When Harmona is killed, he doesn't hesitate to beat Cheza brutally, having decided to destroy the world and arrange for himself to be the only one to enter Paradise.

    Comic Books

-   Usagi Yojimbo: Jei-san is a supernaturally-powered lunatic who kills people he deems to have sinned, without any explanation as to what those sins _are_.
