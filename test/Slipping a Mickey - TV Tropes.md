Leave it to a Scrooge to receive a Mickey.

"_Kick the jukebox, slam the floor  
Drink, drink, drink, drink some more  
I can't think  
Hey! What's in this drink?  
It feels like somebody put something  
Somebody put something in my drink_"

— **The Ramones**, "Somebody Put Something In My Drink"

Tricking someone into drinking a drugged beverage although sometimes food can be spiked as well. One of the most common causes of Instant Sedation next to a Tap on the Head. Typically done to knock out a Mook, to capture a good guy for evil purposes (such as pressganging them onto a ship), or to rob or Date Rape the victim. If the other person suspects something, they may discreetly dispose of the drink or attempt a Poisoned Chalice Switcheroo. Attempting to do this to several different people at once can overlap with One Dose Fits All.

One of The Oldest Tricks in the Book. To the disappointment of many horny guys, it does not work for that purpose, so you're better not to attempt it.

The person who's been drugged (or is doing the drugging) may have some Parting-from-Consciousness Words. There's a good chance that the victim will have an Impairment Shot as they are losing or regaining consciousness.

Subtrope of Artistic License – Law. When this is done by adding a lethal drug to outright kill someone, see Tampering with Food and Drink. Especially in older works, a Poison Ring is used to dump the drug into the beverage. Compare Laxative Prank. Some cases may overlap with Forced Addiction.

Truth in Television: Read all about the original Mickey Finn on Wikipedia. In Real Life, safety advocates warn people to not accept drinks provided by strangers and keep their beverage cup with them at a party (including bringing the cup on bathroom breaks), so that would-be rapists and robbers can't spike it with Rohypnol or GHB.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Sort of happens in _Attack on Titan_, where Zeke, the Beast Titan, has his spinal fluid mixed into wine by his followers, who then secretly get the Eldians of Paradis Island to drink said wine. To explain, if someone of Eldian descent ingests any amount of Zeke's spinal fluid, he can then turn them into a pure titan by screaming. Any pure titans created by Zeke are able to be controlled by him, and can move at night, unlike other pure titans. The plan is discovered when Nicolo, a captured Marleyan chef, tells the Survey Corps after Falco gets hit on the head with a bottle of wine and swallows some.
-   Happens often in _Case Closed_, where culprits tend to drug the food or the drinks of their prospective victims. i.e., Ran once gets pills slid in her coffee by a suspect who then tries to drown her to throw Kogoro and others off and much later Shiratori gets similarly drugged by a prospect murderess as a part of her plan to give herself an alibi while she kills her cheating boyfriend.
-   A comedic example occurs in _Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School_ when Saionji spikes a stew Supreme Chef Hanamura made with his aphrodisiac soup as a prank, and the entire class ends up on the verge of Kissing Under the Influence.
-   In _Denpa Teki na Kanojo_, Miya drugs Juu's drink, and when the drug starts to kick in, she beat him with a baseball bat.
-   In an early episode of _Dragon Ball_, Oolong puts sleep medicine in the gang's drinks so he can molest Bulma. However, this also means that Goku is out cold when Yamcha comes around to rob their camper. In the Viz translated manga, Oolong even uses the term "slipped that mickey" when thinking about drugging Goku.
-   _The Familiar of Zero_:
    -   The heroes do this to an entire detachment of Gallian soldiers during the third season. Since it's so dilute by that point, it takes longer for the effects to appear.
    -   Also at the end of the second season where Saito slips a sleeping potion into Louise's glass of wine so he can get Julio to take her to safety while he sacrifices his life to delay an advancing army.
-   _Freezing_: _Satellizer_, of all people, tries to do this to Kazuya under the advice of Elizabeth. Fridge Brilliance comes out when you remember that Satellizer is a Broken Ace who has Rape as Backstory and thus has no experience in seducing boys and probably doesn't know that its such a bad idea to drug someone you like.
-   One episode of _Hell Girl_ has a sleazeball of a guy drugging his girlfriend this way, so that another friend of his can "borrow" her for the evening in order to finally lose his virginity.
-   If Auguste Beau from _Kaze to Ki no Uta_ offers you wine, drink it at your own risk. Rosemariné fell victim to this in the past, and later in the story, so does Serge. The results in both cases are... less than pleasant.
-   This happens often in _The Kindaichi Case Files_.
    -   The killer in "Playing the Fool (Tarot Lodge Murder Case)" blackmails their victim to put sleeping drugs into Kindaichi's drink. This was done as one of the measures to let the killer slip between their room and the victim's room without anyone noticing since the killer, Kindaichi, Miyuki, and the victim's were next to each other and connected through doors. The killer used a different method for bypassing Miyuki to give themselves an alibi.
    -   The culprit in "Murders from Silver Screen" drugged the entire remaining cast except themselves (but they drank the sedative later) during a discussion via drink to set up what others would see as a murder and suicide committed by the last victim.
        -   In general, this method is often used by culprits who committed their killings as a precaution so that their intended victim couldn't escape and others couldn't find them snooping around, especially when the murder trick used to take a lot of time to execute like blowtorching and reattaching tin blocks on their victim's door in "Alchemy Murder Case."
-   In _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz_, this happens to Relena at a meeting concerning the L3 colonies. Her tea is drugged, and when she wakes up, she's being held hostage by the Mariemaia faction.
-   _Monster Rancher_: In "The Powerful Wondar Brothers", the titular brothers spike the Searchers' stew with a sleeping herb so they can steal Holly's Mystery Disk.
-   _The Mysterious Cities of Gold_: Ambrosius puts Gaspard to sleep by giving him some tempered wine.
-   _Naruto_: To keep Jiraiya from interfering with her plans to deal with Orochimaru, Tsunade pours Jiraiya a shot of sake and adds some unidentified white powder to it. The powder has the effect of putting Jiraiya to sleep and sapping his chakra; Jiraiya comments that Tsunade is the only person he knows that can design a drug that can be slipped into a drink and unnoticed by a ninja. He even uses the term in the English dub after coming to.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ has the Big Bad of the Mahorafest arc drugging Negi and Setsuna so that they'll be forced to use her time machine to get back on schedule.
-   From the same director, _Penguindrum_ has several examples of it.
    -   In episode 8 Ringo drugs a cake that Tabuki and Shouma eat and proceeds to try and rape an unconscious Tabuki. Luckily, an interruption stops anything from happening.
    -   And then in episode 10 Shouma is given a spiked dessert when hospitalized, and the person who gave it to him (Masako) kidnaps him afterwards.
    -   And in episode 14, _Ringo_ is the one in the receiving end, when Yuri drugs her drink to rape her.
-   Happens twice to Fuutarou in _The Quintessential Quintuplets_, both times courtesy of Nino. The first time she does it to avoid studying, and the second because she's upset to discover that he is Kintarou, his "cousin" she fell in love with.
-   _Ranma ½_ has actually used this quite a few times in the manga, usually with Ranma just trying to end a date quicker. In an amusing example, female Ranma found herself roped into a date with a sickly boy who wouldn't take his medicine unless she gave it to him... _personally_. After several unsuccessful tries to just dump the stuff in his mouth, she quickly went "Look over there!" and poured it into his drink, exactly as _he_ poured sleeping powder into _her_ drink. When she woke up a long time later, he STILL hadn't taken the medicine.
-   In the movie of _Revolutionary Girl Utena_, a flashback shows that Akio did this to his sister Anthy and then took advantage of her sexually. This is icky enough, but it then goes on to show that afterwards he realized that she was awake and began to panic, and wound up stabbing her and then falling out a window to his death. Yikes. Worse still? Turns out they'd had each other's drinks. Partly contributing to the above-spoilered event.
-   Happens to Mugen (and maybe Jin) in _Samurai Champloo_, when they wake up they have no money. Earlier in the series, Mugen falls for a Tampering with Food and Drink involving sake and _One-Night Mushroom_.
-   _Soul Eater_: The Thompson Sisters managed to keep Giriko unconscious while his base was being infiltrated by pretending to be his maids, convincing him to go out with them for some drinks, and slipping drugs into his drink. Kid was quite curious as to _why_ they had drugs on them, especially considering they probably hadn't come up with such a plan before they left home.
-   _Sukisho_ sees this done to Sora and Nao, with Soushi drugging their tea and taking them in for a vaguely described medical exam.
-   In _Tiger & Bunny_, Maverick has a habit of drugging people's drinks before he wipes their mind.
-   _Tower of God_:
    -   Tin gave Prince a can of special coffee claiming it would boost his abilities. Prince is suspicious and gives the drink to Ehwa instead, who drinks it and passes out since the drink was naturally drugged. That was exactly as planned, as she was now receptive to a Puppeteer Parasite.
    -   Another case happens during in the Name Hunt Station, where if someone defeats another, either by beating them into submission or via a specific rule where touching the back of the opponent for a specific counts as defeating, the victor gains dominion over the loser (with all the implication that follows). A small-time villain drugs Khun Ran's team to claim easy win using the alternate method, but is later stopped by Ran's friends who suspect foul play.

    Asian Animation 

-   In Season 3 episode 14 of _Happy Heroes_, Big M. wants to take the place of the school doctor as part of an Evil Plan and tries to knock him unconscious by dropping a capsule into his drink. The doctor sees through the trick and makes Big M. drink the liquid he laced with the drug, but he is back to normal by the next scene and giving the Supermen fake checkups as a doctor himself.
-   _Lamput_: In "Shrunk Doc", the docs find their shrunken van in their boss's mustache. To keep the boss from scolding them for not catching Lamput (who is in the tiny car), Fat Doc laces the boss's drink with a sleeping serum.

    -   _Paperinik New Adventures_: Standard modus operandi whenever the superhero Paperinik has his secret identity exposed or needs someone to forget something is to trick them into eating a memory-erasing candy\-an action made more egregious by Paperinik's identity being _Donald Duck_. Outside his comic, the only people who Paperinik trusts enough to _not_ slip the candies are Gyro (who makes all his gadgets, including those candies) and Fethry (who is just too nice to betray him), and they actually decided to take the candies of their own initiative (Gyro because _he_ doesn't trust himself with the secret, and Fethry because he realized he was making a mess and it was better for everyone if he forgot).

-   _The Smurfs_:

Afterwards he collapsed and was brought back to the village. While he was asleep, his little Smurfs locked him inside his own house.

Robin McKinley's version of the story hangs a lampshade on the fact that nobody previous to the hero thought to do this but simply drank what they were given.

Harold then, very reluctantly and feeling incredibly guilty about the situation, attempts to give Fiona the potion with a cup of tea.

-   _Veronica Mars_: Played for Drama.
    -   This is how Veronica was presumably assaulted because Dick drugged Madison with GHB like this but Madison swapped the glasses, and Logan drugged Duncan, which led to Duncan and Veronica having consensual sex under the influence and Veronica having no memory of it. Then it turns out that Veronica was raped by Cassidy Casablancas on the same night.
    -   In Season 3, this is how the Hearst College rapist Mercer gets his victims. And if he doesn't, his co-conspirator Moe will snag them.

The girl was one of several of the gang's victims (one of whom dies as a result), and Walker and Trivette spend the episode searching for the group.
    -   This happens again in "Texas vs. Cahill", when Tony Seville, Alex's ex-boyfriend and the defending attorney in he current trial, visits her with evidence of her current case that would turn things around.

What he doesn't know is that GHB has been substituted for the drug he thought was E. (GHB is perhaps not as pernicious as popularly portrayed, but mixing it with alcohol is a very bad idea.) Thus begins a kidnapping plot which leads to a Constitutional crisis (the President—aware of the frightening implications of his willingness to do almost anything to get her back—agrees to temporarily give up his office under the 25th Amendment).

-   Subverted in Christmas song "Baby It's Cold Outside". It is about a man trying to convince a woman not to leave during a storm. It contains the line "What's in this drink?". That line, along with the man's aggressive attitude, leads modern viewers to view it as this. However, the original intention was that the woman really wants to stay longer but denies it. The "drink" line is supposed to be her simply asking what's in the drink, nothing more<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Due to the Values Dissonance, many covers either replace or outright remove the line.
-   It's likely this happens to the protagonist of Ricky Martin's "Livin' la Vida Loca":
    
    Woke up in New York City
    
    In a funky cheap hotel
    
    She took my heart
    
    And she took my money
    
    She must've slipped me a sleepin' pill
    
-   An Italian folk song called "La Bevanda Sonnifera" has a nobleman proposing to pay a large sum of money to a peasant girl if she would sleep with him. Her mother agrees tells her to go with him, but gives her a sleeping potion that the girl slips him before they go to bed, thus preventing him from actually having sex with her. The next morning the nobleman doesn't remember anything, so he tries to buy another night with her. However, this time the mother forbids it, telling her daughter that while she won the last time, this time she might lose.
-   The Ramones song '"Somebody Put Something in My Drink,'' in which someone puts a tab of acid in Deedee's tangerine tonic for a giggle.
-   In Tone Loc's "Funky Cold Medina," Tone Loc tries a powerful aphrodisiac to get women. He first slips some into his dog's water, then attempts to try it on "Sheena," (but aborts the mission when he finds out Sheena is either a trans woman who has not (yet) had "the op" or a drag queen), then tries it on his date from a game show by slipping it into the drink he buys for her. It works on her...a little too well; she starts talking about marriage and such.
-   At the end of the video for Jonathan Coulton's "Skullcrusher Mountain", the girl who'd been kidnapped by a lovesick mad scientist spikes his wine with Narco-tonic, knocks him out, and flees his lab on Skullcrusher Mountain while he's unconscious.

    Put Molly all in her champagne, she ain't even know it  
    I took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain't even know it
    
-   Erykah Badu's "Certainly" (_Baduizim_) has a few meanings. The most literal is that it's about a woman who is drugged by her date.
    
    You tried to get a little tricky  
    Turned my back and then you slipped me a mickey
    

    Pro Wrestling 

-   In 2006, when legislation was proposed to require professional wrestling organizations to test their performers for drugs, a storyline was contrived and intertwined with the Vince McMahon\-Shawn Michaels feud, whereby McMahon's daughter Stephanie placed a powdery substance in Michaels's water bottle before his match against Shane McMahon. Predictably, Michaels began to get woozy and eventually passed out from the powder's effects, leading to Shane's easy victory; Vince subsequently pinned an unconscious Michaels in an impromptu match immediately following — after which the Spirit Squad, a band of obnoxious male cheerleaders, beat down the prone Michaels.
-   The storyline continued on a later episode of _WWE Raw_, with Vince McMahon attempting to drug Triple H's water. Triple H, however, was wise to this trick and — when Vince walked out of the room — switched drinks.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  During the subsequent Triple H-Shane McMahon match, Triple H pretended to "pass out," but when Shane turned to taunt the audience, he went into a dazed state and fell unconscious. Vince realized what had happened... before turning to see an angry Triple H waiting to finish him off.

    Radio

First, he hides the doped glass and holds out the other to Otto, knowing he'll insist on swapping. Otto takes a sip and spits it out, then suggests they drink "Eastern European fashion" so Bullshot gets the doped glass. Both end up keeling over.
    
    **Bullshot:** You want to curse me von Bruno you can curse me now, for I have slipped you a deuced large Mickey Finn. You will shortly feel the effects. To begin with a crippling pain in your stomach. _(Otto feels his stomach in alarm)_ Followed by slurred speeshhhh _(breaks off into incoherence and keels over unconscious)_

-   Done to _Max Payne_'s title character by Mona Sax in the first game. Turns into Narm on repeated viewings. Sax offers to buy Payne a drink, and he _says_ "As long as you don't try to slip me a mickey." We see him start to lose consciousness two panels later.

-   In _Season of Mystery: The Cherry Blossom Murders_, the villain seems to have a line in killing people while making it look like suicide, and to make sure there isn't any fuss, he drugs them first.
