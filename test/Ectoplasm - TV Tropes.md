Ectoplasm is a substance that paranormal creatures and people associated with them emit or are covered in. In some works, ectoplasm works as a property of matter, while in others it's just used to give supernatural entities another layer of otherworldliness. It's common for ectoplasm to be treated as a form of spiritual energy akin to Soul Power.

Ectoplasm can be used to visualize ghosts and differentiate them from normal people in visual media. It's also useful as an indicator that a ghost has been in an area or has interacted with an object. In some works, ectoplasm slime can only be seen under UV light.

The strange substance is represented in fiction in a variety of ways but it's often depicted as slimy, gaseous, a form of energy, or a ghostly glow. Ectoplasm has been traditionally portrayed as white or translucent but due to the popularity of the _Ghostbusters_ franchise (and Green Is Gross), green is a common color for the mysterious substance in fiction.

The fictional portrayal of ectoplasm has its roots in old spiritualism and occultism circles. It was believed by certain individuals that ectoplasm was the viscous white substance that mediums secrete during seances. There's several old photos floating around of mediums with what appears to be ectoplasm emerging from their orifices but those photos are staged using white cloth as a stand in for ectoplasm. There is no scientific evidence that the substance in its supernatural sense exists; however, the term "ectoplasm" is used in real-life biology to refer to the translucent outer layer of a cell.

It also produces high EMF readings.

    Webcomics 

-   _Homestuck_:
    -   After being brought back to life as a sprite — a being visually very similar to a classic movie ghost, complete with Fog Feet — John's grandma and Rose's cat both show the ability to phase directly through walls with the caveat of leaving large patches of slime covering the places where they do so; this is bright blue for Nannasprite and pink for Jaspersprite, matching their colors. When John alchemically combines Nannasprite's slime with a box of fruit gushers, he gets a pack of "Hellacious Blue Phlegm Aneurysm Gushers" that restore health when eaten.
    -   When characters use a transporter machine to teleport a person or thing to them in a manner that would create a time paradox (such as by trying to grab a version of them from the past when they demonstrably never suddenly vanished into thin air), they instead get a "paradox ghost imprint" composed of thick green goo.

    Web Original 

-   _Neopets_:
    -   Ectoplasm Nachos and Steamed Ectoplasm are two items you can buy from the Spooky Food shop. They both depict pale blue slime with two ghost heads emerging from it. This makes sense, since normal ghost pets are also a pale blue color.
    -   Wraith Ectoplasm is an award given out during the Wraith Resurgence plot. It's a vial filled with creepy purple goo. As Wraith-painted pets are a creepy black-and-purple, it's implied this ectoplasm functions similarly to ghost ectoplasm, in that it's what they're made of.
    -   Discussed in one Festival of Neggs plot, where a strange, glowing goo is seen all over the place. Several characters wonder if it's ectoplasm, which is a distinct possibility, since it was indeed seen in the Haunted Woods. However, when Sophie tastes it, she determines it's not, since she knows what ectoplasm tastes like. It turns out to be a substance secreted by a new species of pet-pet called the Talpidat.

    Western Animation

-   _The Real Ghostbusters_:
    -   Ectoplasm has various properties in the series, some of them inconsistent. For example, in one episode, the ectoplasm was spreading over New York, and was said to be incredibly slick, causing people, and vehicles, to slide everywhere. However, in another episode, Slimer uses his ectoplasm to "glue" Peter to a wall and save him from being sucked through a portal in a t.v. that a group of ghosts were using. Adhesive and slippery are not typically associated with the same substance.
    -   Ectoplasm can also grant normal humans the ability to pass through solid matter, which Slimer uses to help the Junior Ghostbusters escape from Samhain's stronghold in one episode by sliming them and then allowing them to pass through the barriers.
-   _The Simpsons_: In "Tales from the Public Domain", in the segment that parodies the William Shakespeare play _Hamlet_, the ghost of Hamlet's father tells him about his death.

-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: Subverted in "Graveyard Shift", where Squidward tries to claim that the green slime oozing from the walls means a vengeful ghost called the Hash-Slinging Slasher will arrive, but then says, "Oh, wait, they always do that". Thus, implying this green slime is actually a type of mold or fungus.
-   _The Venture Brothers_: In an episode where he tries to bring Hank and Dean back from the dead, the resident wizard Dr. Orpheus ends up covered in ectoplasm.
