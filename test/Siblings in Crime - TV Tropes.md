Joe, William, Jack and Averell Dalton.

The dark side's version of the Sibling Team — criminals who take brothers or sisters along for the ride. They sometimes end up looking like a fraternal version of an Outlaw Couple, also typically a pair. Sometimes they can play off each other as Morality Pets or at least Humanity Pets while other times their partnership can be begrudging underneath or have them tripping over Sibling Rivalry.

Can overlap with Big Bad Duumvirate, may involve Sibling Yin-Yang or Stronger Sibling.

See Also: The Family That Slays Together if parents and other relatives join the siblings on serious crime sprees.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots_: It's not explicitly stated in the first film, but the third movie clarifies that cat assassins are a band of brothers.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The Gruber brothers, Hans and Simon, from the _Die Hard_ movies. Like the Vegas, they're a bit of a subversion in that they turned up separately and apparently didn't like each other much in real life.
-   In _Face/Off_, Castor and Pollux Troy appear to work together as this, based on a police file at the beginning that states that the two together are suspected of assassinating a Croatian ambassador (it reads "Number of hits suggests that Troy had a second shooter; possibly his younger brother Pollux").
-   In _Ghost Rock_, Pickett's gang of outlaws includes the three Thompson brothers.
-   The main bad guys in _Hannie Caulder_ are the Clemens brothers: Emmett, Frank and Rufus. Bank robbers, murderers and rapists, they spend as much time arguing with each other as fighting the law.
-   _The Legend of Frenchie King_: The fearsome gang of outlaws led by Frenchie King consists of five half-sisters. Frenchie King herself is the eldest sister. In the end, they add another set of siblings consisting of four brothers and their eldest sister to the gang.

-   Charlie and Mikey Burns in _The Proposition_
-   The movie _Rat Race_ has Blaine and Duane Cody, who make their money by scamming and stealing. At the beginning of the film, they are playing slots with a stolen donation jar.
-   In the Korean film _Silenced_, Headmaster Lee Gang-bok and Admin Head Lee Gang-seok (who are Creepy Twins to boot) inflict horrific sexual abuse on the female students of their Boarding School of Horrors. Their adoptive sister, Yun Ja-ae, is also complicit in their crimes and deals out plenty of (physical) abuse herself.
-   Quentin Tarantino's storied universe has an interesting, somewhat unintentional subversion with Vic and Vincent Vega. Both characters are hardened criminals, Word of God makes it clear that they're supposed to be related to each other and have had a history together, but the two characters have never been seen together in movies. For a while, Tarantino was apparently working on putting together a Vega Brothers movie, but he ended up abandoning such a project around 2007 when he concluded that the principal actors, Michael Madsen and John Travolta, would be too old now to reprise their roles.
    -   The hillbilly killer rapists Zed and Maynard are brothers as well, according to the script, however, this wasn't mentioned in the film itself.
    -   _From Dusk Till Dawn_, however, begins with the audience following the escapades of the Gecko Brothers Seth and Richie.

    -   _Han Solo at Star's End_ features a sympathetic version, with two brothers who work for Doc Vandergate's outfit of outlaw technicians.
    -   Gallandro's employers in _Han Solo and the Lost Legacy,_ are a pair of murderous twins who run a mining camp.
-   Dave and Banjo Lilywhite in _Hogfather_ try to rob the Tooth Fairy together.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   The Carrows, brother and sister, are nasty Death Eaters (Amycus being one of two known female Death Eaters, in fact).
    -   The only other known female Death Eater is Bellatrix Lestrange. Her sister, although not actually a Death Eater, is married to one and supports the Death Eaters as long as her husband and son aren't threatened.
    -   Bellatrix's husband, Rudolphus, and his brother Rabastan are both Death Eaters.
-   The fourth _Kitty Norville_ book contains a very nasty case of this. The sister is a skinwalker, a practitioner of one of the evilest kinds of magic. She killed one of her sisters to get the power. Her twin brother is a werewolf; she became a skinwalker essentially to keep him company when he turned wolf, with none of the drawbacks of lycanthropy. Both are murderous and out of control.
-   Louis L'Amour: It would be easier to list the number of L'Amour books and short stories which _don't_ have villainous brothers (and the occasional sister) working together. Normally they only serve as Mooks, but the Big Bad and The Dragon of _Passing Through_ are brothers. Normally they are closely knit and the death of one will provoke attempts at revenge (or, in rarer cases, a Heel Realization or Know When to Fold 'Em desire). One notable exception is embodied by Ike and Purdy Mantle in _The Quick and the Dead._ They work together but Ike openly acknowledges they have little in common and doesn't protest when their last fellow gang member kills Purdy for trying to quit. He comments that it will feel odd going on without Purdy after all the years they spent riding together, but he shows no real sadness or anger and loyally aids his brother's killer for the rest of the book.
-   The two Crane brothers control the black inmates of the prison in _The Mental State_ like mafia. Little Mickey serves as the brains and Big Billy takes on the role of the muscle.
-   _Serge Storms_
    -   The McGraw Brothers from _Triggerfish Twist_ are a group of dangerous rednecks with long rap sheets. A carjacking victim killing one of the brothers in self-defense in _Triggerfish Twist_ sets the rest of the family on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge that doesn't go as planned.
    -   In _The Big Bamboo_, Serge joins his newly discovered half-brother Ford in a scheme to con two corrupt movie producers and then engineer their deaths.
    -   In _Gator-a-Go_, The Queenpin known as _Madre_ once ran her cartel along with her two older brothers before the informant she spends the book chasing mucked things up a few years before the story. Specifically, when a Dirty Cop told _Madre_ that one of her brothers passed on information to the authorities but she didn't know which, she cheerfully ordered the murders of both of her brothers to make sure she punished the right one.
    -   There are a few sets of brothers in the Small-Town Tyrant clan from _Coconut Cowboy_. Said clan runs speed traps, illegally pumps more water than allowed by law, engages in voter fraud, moves money around for a drug dealer, and kills a few people.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Altered Carbon_ gives us secondary villain Dimitri Kadmin, also known as Dimi the Twin, who is his own brother. Not exactly a clone, Dimi uses the series' gimmick of creating a digital copy of his mind and personality to create illegal copies of himself in multiple bodies, known as double-sleeving. Though technically the same person, the copies consider themselves to be brothers. Series protagonist Takeshi Kovacs uses the same technique at one point but doesn't consider his double to be a brother.

    -   The first season gives us the D'Alessio brothers, a group of about half a dozen brothers of various ages who were petty criminals that become involved in bootlegging at the start of Prohibition.

Eventually Rothstein and Thompson call a truce, and as part of their deal Rothstein gives Thompson information on where to find the remaining brothers, Nucky's men and allies promptly wipe them out.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   A few seasons later, Al Capone is seen alongside his brothers Ralph and Frank in his criminal endeavors.

-   _Criminal Minds_:
    -   The Hunter unsubs of the episode "Open Season" turn out to be a pair of brothers who abduct other humans, set them loose in the middle of the woods, and have a blast chasing and killing them. They basically get discovered due to the elder brother petting the dog (the younger is severely wounded when their prey fights back, and he starts a fire to signal for help), and this is actually somewhat made a point.
    -   "To Hell..."/"...And Back" has this with a horrible twist. One brother is quadriplegic, the other is physically able but seriously mentally impaired. The former manipulates the latter, who doesn't really know what he's doing, into all the crimes.

    -   Boyd and Bowman Crowder follow in the footsteps of their arch-criminal father Bo, though their run their own independent criminal enterprises rather than teaming up. Bowman is killed before the start of the series so Boyd later teams up with his cousin Johny.
    -   The head of the Miami drug cartel likes to use two siblings — his own niece and nephew — to represent him for important deals.

    -   In "Heart's Desire", brothers Jake and Ben Miller are members of a gang of outlaws in The Wild West.

He has no problem with murder, and is prone to getting violent, even with his brother on occasion. But usually, when he sees he has really scared, or upset his brother, he calms down and apologizes.

-   Lots of _Walker, Texas Ranger_ episodes involve this sort of topic.

    Real Life 

In traditional societies with autocratic governments — that is to say, most societies since the existence of agriculture — the consequences for law-breaking have been serious, and no-one outside the extended family can really be trusted. Add another common feature of traditional societies — punishments that are inflicted on entire families regardless of individual guilt or innocence — and the incentive structure for family participation in crime if crime is what's needed is sturdy and strong.
