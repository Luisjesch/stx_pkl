_"Creating a tempest whirling at speeds of a hundred kilometers per hour around the target, whilst the target herself feels nothing but the soft touch of a gentle breeze! Truly the ultimate wind technique for granting the dreams of men!!"_

A comedy trope in which a character's skirt, dress or similar garment gets lifted by a sudden unexpected gust of wind. Bonus points if this causes them to shriek and try to push their skirt back down. If the character is a Covert Pervert they may actually enjoy the experience, or at least the attention it gets.

The Trope Namer and most iconic example, of course, is Marilyn Monroe in _The Seven Year Itch_ standing over the subway vent (see picture). As such, a common stock parody includes having the character adopt Monroe's pose from the scene.

May or may not result in Comedic Underwear Exposure, depending on the presence or absence of underwear, the angle it's seen from, and the victim's reaction time (for some reason, characters always tend to be quicker on the draw when it's seen from the front). The more vulgar examples (of the bathroom variety) would include the skirts being blown away by "wind", likely a reference to Marilyn's flatulence problems and poor personal hygiene.

While this occasionally happens in Real Life, it requires a short skirt made of light fabric, a strong wind, and an updraft, whereas in fiction it often happens to any skirt with the slightest breeze. By the way, if you ever do feel the wind lifting your skirt, pushing it down as Marilyn did in the movie is likely to give the wind more surface area to push up against, exacerbating the problem and drawing more attention from passersby; it's best to either gather a side of the skirt in one hand, put a pin in it (many women carry a safety pin in their purse for this reason), just let the wind have a cheap thrill until the gust has passed, or plan ahead and wear something other than a flared or pleated skirt in windy weather. Whatever blows your skirt up.

Often used as a Modeling Pose.

The iconic scene only has Marilyn's feet being shown in the film, while the photoshoots were published elsewhere.
-   Kelly LeBrock's scene from _The Woman in Red_ is also well known, and is frequently parodied in Europe (particularly Italy), perhaps because _The Woman in Red_ itself is nearly a shot-for-shot remake of the 1976 French film _Un éléphant ça trompe énormément_, also known as _Pardon Mon Affaire_.
-   In 2000's _2001: A Space Travesty_, a flight attendant (Stephanie Dumolin-Shaw) climbs up a ladder on a space shuttle and her dress blows up from behind, showing off her nearly nude booty that can still be seen through clear pantyhose (she doesn't seem to be wearing any panties), due to a lack of gravity and Marshal Dix (Leslie Nielsen) checks her out.

See Image Links above or this borderline NSFW 40-second video.
-   Parodied — gruesomely — in _The House Bunny_, where Anna Faris' character tries the Marilyn Maneuver while standing over an open manhole... and gets scalded. We then see her recovering from her injuries with a male companion in a restaurant, and her legs are heavily bandaged with gauze - and those areas that aren't bandaged have ugly welts on them. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to guilt-trip the audience by saying: "You bastards! You were _laughing and hooting_ at this!"

The boy peddles toward her checking her out and sees a bus driving across the street, heading in their direction. The boy anticipates the draft from the passing bus to blow up Bernadette's dress, which evidently does, she gasps and is mortified. When her dress gets lifted, rather than holding that down, she holds on to her hat to keep that from getting blown away and raises one leg, knee bent forward, to hide part of her unmentionables, which are white panties with matching girdle (or corset). The boy enjoys the view and gets a snicker out of it.

    Live-Action TV

-   In the _Mr. Bean_ episode, "Back To School, Mr. Bean", rather than the wind causing this, a lady's ankle-length skirt receives a static cling to her upper body, which is caught in the skirt when it blows up, due to static electricity on a piece of paper Mr. Bean hands her and her white panties with some pattern are on display for everyone at a science fair to see. The static electricity was transferred onto the paper after he touched a Van Der Graaff Generator.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   One of the best examples of this trope occurred at WWE's _Cyber Sunday_ pay-per-view (their final one by that name) in October 2008. Since the event took place just before Halloween, the Divas held their second annual Halloween Costume Contest. Candice Michelle (who had missed the previous year's contest due to a neck injury) was prominently featured as Marilyn Monroe from _The Seven Year Itch_, complete with a blonde wig and a copy of the famous white halter dress. Not about to miss a golden opportunity, WWE had an air jet installed under the entry ramp to the arena to blast Candice's dress as she came down to the ring for the final judging - and the resulting Panty Shot revealed that Candice was wearing _the exact same cut of panties that Marilyn had had on in the 1955 film_. Candice obviously did her homework.
-   And then there was the case of another Diva wearing the white halter dress. D-Generation X were scheduled to compete in a tag team match with Vince McMahon one night in the summer of 2009, but Shawn Michaels and Triple H worried that Vince just wasn't "angry" enough to make an effective combatant. They spent the whole time before the match trying different strategies to goad him to violence, and one of them was sending the _atrocious_ singing Diva Jillian Hall into his office wearing a _Seven Year Itch_ costume and performing Marilyn's birthday song for President Kennedy in her hideous voice (though Marilyn had not been dressed that way when she sang for Kennedy). Vince screamed "GET OUTTA MY OFFICE!" and became steadily more filled with rage as the night wore on, until he was finally ready to compete. (This incident culminated in commentator Jerry Lawler noting that Jillian looked a lot "like Monroe"....and then, a moment later, clarified that he meant _James_!)

-   This is one of Sue's events in _Mitsumete Knight_. And to make it clear about the reference, the CG obtained through this event is called "The Monroe Effect" in the game's CG Gallery, the Mitsumete Gallery. The event also has a nice Refuge in Audacity moment : when Sue asks the Asian (the player's avatar) if he saw anything, the best answer is to actually tell "They (the panties) were white". This will reassure her, saying that he hasn't seen them then, since he said the wrong colour.
-   The tag-team arena in _Dead or Alive 2_ allows for this with female fighters. It's more interesting than the combat, really.

-   One of the Punishment videos in Kamen no Maid Guy: Boyoyon Battle Royale has Fubuki doing this when a gust of wind comes by and blows her dress up, which results in a boy getting a nosebleed (with his friend asking if he's okay), and a male driver to become distracted, resulting in the person crashing into a stationary pole.

-   In the debut trailer for _Rayman Origins_, this is shown to have been Rayman's first action after being created by Betilla the Fairy, by standing beneath her and using his Helicopter Hair to create an updraft. Tellingly, Betilla reacts more positively every time it happens...
