**Queen Titania:** Astral, the others are a young race, they have so much to learn. They don't remember that we were once their guides.

**Princess Astral:** Well... this one's different. He has blond hair, and soft blue eyes! And a smile that makes me feel like...

**Titania:** ... a warm sun?

**Astral:** Yes!

— Brief conversation referring to Tristan Andersen from _The Other Kingdom_

The character is a blonde. Therefore, obviously, she is young, beautiful, pure, kind, and innocent, and the innocence can range up to Virgin Power. If she fights, it's reluctantly and she tends to avoid violence where she can.

Victorian literature would also use it to portray her as delicate and fragile, if not actually Delicate and Sickly—being, of course, Too Good for This Sinful Earth. This part is largely a Discredited Trope.

Men falling under this trope are rarer, but the blond hero can also have Hair of Gold. Such a hero is more action-oriented than the Hair of Gold heroine, but he is also good, wholesome, kind to those weaker than himself, modest, and prone to be the Chaste Hero or Celibate Hero.

Often paired with Innocent Blue Eyes.

Compare and contrast Mystical White Hair, where a pale hair color denotes arcane traits, with or without Incorruptible Pure Pureness. Also compare the popular and fun-loving Everyone Loves Blondes, and contrast White Hair, Black Heart, for when light hair is paired with an evil character. Dumb Blonde can be related if Dumb Is Good is also in play.

**Note**: Not all blondes belong in this list. Not even all good blondes. If the character does not match the personality type, then they do not have Hair of Gold, Heart of Gold and should be listed only if they exploit the expectation (such as using their blonde hair to look sweet and innocent).

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Daimos_: Richter is this after he becomes The Atoner, risking his life to save the remaining Baam-seijin from crashing into Jupiter. Unfortunately, this only lasts a short while, because what he does next is truly horrifying.
-   _Doraemon_
    -   Eru, the Mu knight from _Doraemon: Nobita and the Castle of the Undersea Devil_ (anime version) is blond and the _only_ Mu resident who accepts Nobita, Doraemon and the gang as friends, unlike the other members of Mu council who had an open Fantastic Racism towards surface folk.
    -   In the manga _Doraemon: Nobita and the Robot Kingdom_, the adorable little Robot Kid, Poko, is designed with blond hair and easily the nicest character in the entire film; in contrast Poko's playmate Jeanne is a Fiery Redhead who Used to Be a Sweet Kid before growing up into a tyrannical dictator. The anime adaptation plays around the trope giving the villain Jeanne an Adaptation Dye-Job, so Jeanne is blonde too... _and_ an Adaptational Nice Guy, with blonde anime Jeanne's Heel–Face Turn happening sooner than her redheaded manga counterpart.
    -   _Doraemon: Nobita's Treasure Island_ have the two new characters, the siblings Flock and Sarah, both whom are blond and absolutely nice people to the main cast. In fact, among all the characters introduced, the nicest of them (the siblings, their mother Fiona, Sarah's mentor Maria) are all blonde.
-   ''Isabelle of Paris': Jean has blonde hair and is a happy-go-lucky boy, albeit a rather annoying one. He stands with Isabelle even after she's disgraced by the public.
-   A number of examples in _Lyrical Nanoha_:
    -   Fate Testarossa who, even during her tenure as a Dark Magical Girl, was depicted to be kind and innocent to the point of Love Martyrdom. She then grows up to become the most blatantly Lawful Good character in the series.
    -   Carim Gracia in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ has lush golden hair and is one of the Big Goods of the series and the honorable leader of the Church Knights, with the Saint Church being pretty much the only infallibly good authority left in the series.
    -   Vivio, also of _StrikerS_, is a young, cheerful, Mysterious Waif adopted by the main character and the aforementioned Fate.
    -   In _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid_, the last Saint King of Belka, Olivie Sägebrecht, who Vivio happens to be a clone of, is described to have been "bright as the sun, and subtle as a flower."
-   _Soul Eater_ has a very interesting version with its girls: Maka Albarn's blond hair has hints of silver (and she is the wisest), Liz Thompson has a caramel blond coloring (she is the most jaded, though remains optimistic), and Patti Thompson has cornsilk coloring and is the sweetest and most idealistic of the three (most of the time). Then again, there is Marie Mjolnir. Justin Law at first seems to follow this, being a chaste (or so we think) young death scythe.
-   The Touden siblings, Laios and Falin, from _Delicious in Dungeon_. Both are blonde as well as being friendly, kind, well-intentioned and selfless.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ has quite a few.
    -   The prominent female examples start off with Erina whose the pure and kind childhood friend turned wife of the equally good Johnathan Joestar, followed by Suzi Q the compassionate ditz who falls in love with the reckless Joseph Joestar and then finally Holy Kujo (the mother of Jotaro) daughter of Joseph and Suzi Q. The first JoJos really love their blondes.
    -   Prominent male examples are: Robert E. O. Speedwagon (young) who goes from asshole to bosom buddy to Jonathan very quickly, ditto for Caesar Anthonio Zeppeli for Joseph in part 2 and Giorno Giovanna in part 5. Even though Giorno is the illegitimate son of DIO... who subverts this trope hard along with Yoshikage Kira.
-   In _Stretch_, Ran fits this quite nicely; although she teases Keiko a lot, that's just the way the dynamic between the two women works. Although the manga is black-and-white, the title pages to each chapter are in colour, and show Ran as having blonde hair.
-   _Project A-Ko_: C-ko, who is a strawberry blonde, was described in one of the original Japanese promos as "innocence personified".
-   _Berserk_: Farnese de Vandimion when she stops being a Knight Templar and takes many levels in kindness becomes this as well as a Rebellious Princess. Plus she has some Virgin Power. It can also be argued Farnese's half brother Serpico is this as well as despite the cynical world that he resides in, Serpico is one of very few individuals to stand out as genuinely polite, gentlemanlike and sincere.
    -   From the original Band of Hawk the light haired Judeau and Rickert can hold claim to this trope having kind personalities in contrast to the very dark protagonist.
    -   Sonia _would_ fit this trope to a T especially since she's a medium, but subverted as she serves and adores Griffith and therefore is one of the bad guys.
-   Asia Argento from _High School D×D_ basically is this trope. She's so sweet and innocent (she used to be a nun, after all) that even Issei tries to stop himself from fantasizing about her. He's not hugely successful, but still.
-   Not even a demon can find much fault in Elizabeth in _Black Butler_, even if she _did_ probably lose any Virgin Power she might have had.
-   _Ouran High School Host Club_ has Tamaki Suoh, a boy who has a very optimistic view on life, despite his own past and present hardships. He tries to see the good in people and, like a true romantic, thinks every woman is beautiful in her own way. Despite him being The Charmer, his views on love are quite innocent and old fashioned. Honey would fit this trope as well, especially considering he even _looks_ a lot like a child, although he's actually the oldest of the Hosts. He also carries around a bunny plushie and has a love for sweets—cake in particular.

-   In _A Certain Magical Index_ Vento of the Front is an interesting case, since her appearance is described as that of a holy virgin, but is ruined by her self-presentation.
-   Reinhard von Lohengramm in _Legend of the Galactic Heroes_ subverts this trope beautifully: he's certainly an angelic-looking young man, he's viewed by people as a perfect hero but his methods firmly place him into the Anti-Hero territory. His sister Annerose, though, is a straight example — she wouldn't hurt a fly.
-   Alibaba from _Magi: Labyrinth of Magic_ starts out as somewhat of a subversion, with greed and ass-kissing being his primary traits, but later chapters reveal his kindhearted and good nature. He goes on to become an All-Loving Hero for his home country and continues to get stronger for the sake of the entire world.
-   Kotori from _X/1999_ has flowing golden locks in the manga. Her design seems to be inspired from Victorian aesthetics—a sweet, innocent, ill girl who is kind beyond measure and associated with white birds and feathers as symbols of purity.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Kaya may well be one of the poster girls for this trope, she's so pure tragedy makes her ill. Her only flaw is that she's kinda spoiled. After maturing Kaya decides to become doctor simply because she wants to heal people.
    -   Conis... she's literally a goddamn blonde angel who plays a harp and helps the crew solely out of the goodness of her heart. Nuff said.
    -   It appears Victoria Cindry was this when she was alive, even her undead corpse keeps her good nature as Chopper can make her Heel–Face Turn from Dr Hogback.
    -   Marguerite from the Kuja Tribe is the first Amazon in Amazon Lily to trust Luffy, a male, and speaks up for him when Boa Hancock condemns him. Also one of the sexiest examples.
    -   Fishman Island's Queen Otohime gives previous examples a run for their money, not only does she strive for peace between Fishmen and humans but Otohime is so good she can turn a Celestial Dragon into legitimately good human being _just by spending time with him_. Even when she was shot by Hody Jones, she did not hate him and pleaded her children to not hate him either.
    -   Vinsmoke Sora is one of the most compassionate selfless individuals in the series which is saying something, Sora was willingly to take a drug that would kill her so long as her one of her sons would have humanity; for Sora it was Worth It.
        -   Sora's third son Sanji (the one who the drugged worked on) at his very best takes after his mother closely though he acts like a lech at times.
    -   Other male examples include: Helmeppo (after he Took a Level in Kindness) Sabo, Kohza, Marco, Yorki, Igaram, Young Whitebeard and Rocinate.
    -   Subverted with Axe-Hand Morgan, Miss Valentine, Bellamy, Enel, Kalifa, Absalom, Dellinger, Domflamingo, Jack and Judge.
-   Ada from _PandoraHearts_ is a sweet girl who loves cats and wants nothing more than to bring her brother back from the Abyss. Turns out she was _so_ inspired to rescue Oz that she did research into the occult and became quite fascinated with it, so much so that she managed to freak out _Vincent_, of all people.
-   This trope even exists in the light-hearted Gag Series _Daily Lives of High School Boys_. Yoshitake is blond and is the single person of the cast who subscribes the most in True Companions.
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   Sailor Moon herself tends to fit the trope most of the time, and despite her flaws, she is a good-hearted person who believes that she can work through every problem she faces to make the best situation for everyone.
    -   Sailor Venus too fits, as, in spite of her flaws, she's a superhero out of pure will of doing good, is a blood donor, and generally helps people whenever she finds trouble (even if she sometimes makes things _worse_ due her ditziness and/or hot-bloodedness). In the third season of the first anime this led to a rather funny, yet subtly creepy episode, when, not having been targeted by the enemy for a Pure Heart Crystal when her friends had, she tried to _bait them_.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_: Mami is the kindhearted, feminine Team Mom of the group. She's also very lonely and depressed, and angsty over the accident that killed her parents. And she takes Good Is Not Soft to excessive levels. In one timeline, after learning that magical girls eventually become witches, she decides they all need to die before they become monsters and _kills Kyoko on the spot_, forcing Madoka to take her out before she does the same to Homura.
-   Seras Victoria from _Hellsing_, she standouts as the only unabashedly good and compassionate person in the whole franchise being very against drinking blood despite being a Vampire. Nonetheless the inherent Ax-Crazy nature is brought out of Seras by ultra violence, her mentor/sire Alucard, losing Pip and especially her Dark and Troubled Past however unlike Alucard, Seras has the capacity the flip back into an optimistic bright attitude after heavy tragedy, she also has some Virgin Power which is what saved her dying at the start of the series. Lampshaded by the author Kouta Hirano who describes Seras as a “light shining in darkness”.
-   Goku, Gohan, Future Trunks, and Goten from _Dragon Ball_, when in Super Saiyan form.
    -   This only applies to Saiyans who are both naturally kind and docile in their base form _and_ successfully mastered the Super Saiyan form. Goku when he first ascended and especially Gohan, a Super Saiyan 2, both subvert this by regressing into a far more ruthless and even sadistic state of mind.
    -   Mrs. Brief, Bulma's mother, also qualifies. Sure, she's a Dumb Blonde, but she's a polite, good-natured woman.
    -   Inverted for Lunch. Her blue-haired side is sweet, but her blonde-haired side becomes a Jerk with a Heart of Gold.
    -   Zigzagged with Android 18; on one hand she's pretty ruthless and cold (including being homicidal in the Bad Future), but on the other hand she's a wonderful wife and loving mother so after taking a level in kindness she is certainly is this trope. 18 and Krillin's daughter Maron plays this trope straight especially in GT when she's older.
-   Yellow from _Pokémon Adventures_. She's sweet-tempered and quite a bit of a Martial Pacifist, not to mention a Friend to All Living Things as well. She's also the youngest out of the Kanto Dex Holders and is rather physically small for her age.
-   Naruto essentially become this trope plus Messianic Archetype. Others who fit this bill are Minato (Naruto's dad), Tsunade, Ino and Temari after they Took a Level in Kindness. Naruto's son Boruto zigzags this trope, being more introverted than his father but still a good person underneath.
-   _Attack on Titan_:
    -   Krista who is young and pretty and is easily the most traditionally 'good', chivalrous, and caring character in the whole series. She even invokes this trope; her drive to live up to this image and be a good girl turns downright martyr-like at times in the worst possible ways.
    -   Armin is a more downplayed example; he's comparatively a Non-Action Guy, the sensitive guy in his Sensitive Guy and Manly Man combo, and is genuinely kind and caring towards his teammates especially in the beginning. Also subverted later on as he grows more and more into a Consummate Liar Chessmaster role. As a bonus, both of these characters have Innocent Blue Eyes.
-   Princess Emeraude of _Magic Knight Rayearth_ has the appearance of a young girl and is charged with upholding the eternal peace of the land of Cephiro through her prayer. During the story, she's often weeping Tender Tears at the thought of her land falling into ruin and guides the Power Trio through a Secret Test of Character. Even when she turns evil, it's from heartbreak over the death of her true love, and she begs the girls to kill her—which had been her intention all along, as she would rather die than end up destroying Cephiro.
-   _Rune Soldier Louie_: Melissa is a priestess of the Mylee faith, who longed to serve a noble and just champion of the people, and do great deeds by his side. Instead, fate chose Louie for her. Regardless, she remained true to the path Mylee set for her, though it was against her will. So much so, that she refused to desert Louie during a cave-in, despite his insistence that she leave for her own safety. They eventually exit the cave together, both completely unharmed.
-   Ai from _Sunday Without God_ is sweet, kind, and optimistic, and wants to save the world. Most characters can't help but admire her innocence and determination, and she spends most of the series helping the people she meets.
-   _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_: This trope applies to Clara and her mother, Athena, who are both blonde superheroines. The first chapter lampshades it during a news broadcast, where the news anchor describes them as angels of beauty, virtue, and justice.
-   Kaori from _Your Lie in April_ is one of the few characters who isn't a brunette or raven. She's a sweet, excitable violinist and is a sort of Manic Pixie Dream Girl to Kousei. In the anime, her hair and skin pale significantly, along with her Innocent Blue Eyes turning near grey, after her illness takes a turn for the worse.

-   _My Hero Academia_ has All Might, the number one hero. His brilliantly blond hair is only matched by his beaming smile and incredible strength. He's a Gentle Giant who is always there to defeat villainy wherever it may spring up and comfort a crying child in their time of need.
-   Shirogane from _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ is depicted as being incredibly kind and helpful to everyone around him in spite of his massive ego (in fact, it's the reason Kaguya fell in love with him to begin with). It's even shown at one point that being needlessly cold to people causes him physical pain. Though it's worth pointing out that he technically isn't a real blond, since Word of God states that it's just artistic liscence.
-   Eripoyo from _If My Favorite Pop Idol Made It to the Budokan, I Would Die_. Her second most noticeable trait is the obsession she with idol singer Maina. The characteristic she's most known, however, is the genuine love she has for her favorite idol and the great lengths she'll go to in order to make Maina happy and number one in her group.
-   _Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun_: Kou Minamoto has golden blonde hair, as does his older brother Term. However, Kou exhibits the heart of gold aspect of this trope more than his brother does, being one of the kindest characters in the series.
-   Miu Furinji of _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_ practices martial arts following the philosophy of using them only in self-defense and to protect other people, inherited (along with her long blond hair) from her grandfather. Outside combat she's one of the sweetest and gentlest girls you'll ever meet, and a Kindhearted Cat Lover to boot. No wonder Kenichi fell in love with her.
-   Kisa Sohma from _Fruits Basket_ has golden blonde hair, and she's one of the sweetest and most innocent characters in the series. Unfortunately, her golden hair is part of what causes her to be bullied since her classmates don't believe that it's natural (it's due to her being possessed by the spirit of the Tiger from the Eastern Zodiac, which has the side effect of giving her naturally golden hair and eyes).
-   _Talentless Nana_ has straight, Subverted, then Subverted-_then_\-played-straight examples:
    -   Michiru Inukai has soft, fluffy, pale blonde hair and is about the nicest, most compassionate, and unquestionably good characters in the series.
    -   Yuuka Sasaki has darker blonde hair and is a murderous Yandere who killed then reanimated her childhood friend Shinji to make him her boyfriend forever.
    -   Moe Mokabe has blonde hair, is chipper and friendly but is a sociopathic anti-Talented murderer like Nana. Then, she eventually starts to sympathize with Nana's crusade against the Organization they used to work for and starts being less villainous.
-   _Dr. STONE_: Lillian Weinberg is a blonde and one of the nicest characters, subverting the other astronauts' expectations of her as The Prima Donna. She tells Byakuya that, while she loves singing for itself, she wants to make others happy with her songs. The one she broadcasts to the entire world from the station is one of encouragement. Both of these traits were evidently inherited by her descendants Kohaku and Ruri.
-   The titular heroine of _Hello! Sandybell_ is an English girl with blonde hair and blue eyes, and is a cheerful Friend to All Living Things. Her Animal Companion is a collie/Scottish sheepdog mix named Oliver.
-   _Interspecies Reviewers_: Fallen Angel Crim has a full head of long golden-blonde locks, and he's the nicest character in the whole cast.

    Ballads 

-   In the Child Ballad _Sir Aldingar_, one variant describes the innocent queen's hair as yellow:
    
    _"They've putten her into prison strang,  
    A twalmon lang and mair,  
    Until the mice and wild rattens  
    Did tear her yallow hair."_
    
-   "The Twa Sisters" Child Ballad has a beautiful and innocent blond girl murdered by her evil sister. A harp is made of her bones, and her golden hair is used for the strings. The magic harp sings out an accusation of her murderer.

    Comic Books 

-   _Archie Comics_: Archie heroines tend to fit this trope, especially Betty Cooper, whose most common characterization is the nicest, most innocent and pure-hearted girl in Riverdale, in contrast to the more savvy, black-haired Veronica Lodge (with whom Betty tries to be friends and avoid conflict). Other strong examples are _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_ and Melody from _Josie and the Pussycats_.
-   _Astro City_: American Chibi sports blond Girlish Pigtails, and is one of the most dedicated heroines.
-   _Aquaman_: Arthur Curry can be a male example of this trope if he wants, though he switches into a Proud Warrior Race Guy at the drop of a dime. However, Aquaman is mostly characterised as being a benevolent ruler.
-   _Black Canary_: Though she technically dyed her hair Dinah Laurel Lance becomes this trope as much as Supergirl as well as being a loving wife to Oliver Queen the _Green Arrow_ who counts in this trope as well.
-   _Captain America_: Steve Rogers is another male example.
-   _Captain Marvel_: Carol Danvers, Depending on the Writer and the continuity, although more often than not, she is generally portrayed as possessing this trait.
-   _The Crow_: Shelly is a blonde (which may surprise fans who only know the Brandon Lee film in which Shelly was a brunette and suitably goth-ish partner to the film's characterisation of Eric as an indie rock guitarist), whose beauty, purity, good-heartedness and innocence are constantly emphasised.
-   _Fantastic Four_: Sue Storm is a good superheroine, a good mother, and in general just a good person. She manages to play Team Mom to the majority of the Earth’s heroes.
-   _The Flash_: Barry Allen is a standout male example, his Nice Guy status rivals Superman.
-   _"Golden Eyes" and Her Hero "Bill"_: Golden Eyes, the titular heroine of the World War I serial, combines this trope with Curtains Match the Window. She's shown to be a friend to children and animals (sells her Plunder to finance an orphanage _and_ has a Heroic Dog companion), faithful to her sweetheart Bill (rejects all the suitors that try to seduce her while he's away, then follows him overseas to join the war effort as an ambulance driver), and reluctant even to harm the German officer who captures and menaces her.
-   _Judge Dredd_: Judge Anderson is a pretty blonde with psychic powers, and is always portrayed as the most kind-hearted of the Judges, especially compared to stoic hard-asses like Joe Dredd.
-   _Lady Death_: Hope used to have blonde hair when she was a sweet young woman before turning into the eponymous protagonist and her hair fading to white and turning into a harsher person. Her half-sister Vandala, on the other hand, plays this straight, being a brave and valiant Valkyrie with golden hair.
-   _The Mighty Thor_: Despite being red headed in the myths, Thor is a male example, being very compassionate despite occasional arrogance. One of his nicknames is "Goldilocks".
-   _Millie the Model_: Millie is nice, young, and innocent, especially compared to her Fiery Redhead rival, Chili Storm.
-   _Sin City_: It's hard to tell because the comics are largely black and white, but Nancy Callahan is canonically blonde. A young woman working herself through law school by working as a topless exotic dancer off hours, she's probably the kindest and most innocent character in the comics (Word of God calls her "an angel" living in a Wretched Hive). She's acquainted with a lot of the major characters, who protect her from abusive or downright evil men out to hurt her.
-   _The Smurfs_: Smurfette, natch. Originally a creation of Gargamel with a black heart who hunts down the Smurfs for him, she reforms her devious ways and transforms into a golden-hearted Smurf with blonde hair to match, now becoming a member of our pint-sized blue buddies.
-   _Spider-Man_: Gwen Stacy was initially portrayed as a haughty ice queen, but ultimately she's remembered and beloved for her sweetness and loving heart.
-   _Supergirl_: All versions of Supergirl—including her Earth-2 counterpart, _Power Girl_—have a single thing in common: they're kind-hearted, blonde girls who don't want to see anybody getting hurt and use their huge powers to help and protect people. Kara Zor-El may be short-tempered, angsty, have anger issues... but she'll always be a good person deep-down:
    -   Pre-Crisis Kara was an absolutely sweet, innocent child. She stopped being gullible when she grew up, and her adult self had quite the temper, but she always was a nice, selfless person. In _Krypton No More_, she flies across a galaxy to save lives because it's the right thing to do.
    -   In the beginning, Post-Crisis Kara behaved as an emo, self-centered, angry, bratty teen due to Kryptonite poisoning. However, she began dealing with her issues, got cured, and developed into a kind, compassionate and cheerful woman.
    -   New 52 Kara was a lonely, insolated teen who had anger issues and Survivor Guilt due to losing her family and getting stranded in an alien world. Even so, she went out of her way to help people and risked her life to protect others. In the _Red Daughter of Krypton_ storyline she confronted her anger issues and got over her rage, angst and confusion. When _Supergirl (Rebirth)_ kicks off, she has become the kind of person who will stop criminals, send them to prison and try to help them.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   Steve Trevor, traditional love interest and husband to Wonder Woman, is usually a blond, humble, self-sacrificing kind of fellow.
    -   Depending on the Writer and the continuity, Cassandra Sandsmark can either be this or a Jerkass.
-   _X-Men_: Before her corruption by Belasco, Illyana Rasputin was a sweet and innocent young child, with the malice she later struggled with entirely absent from her character.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Non Sequitur_: The blond Kate is the more optimistic and less ambitious Foil to her black-haired sister, Danae.
-   _Peanuts_: Charlie Brown's little sister, Sally, fits this trope. When he accused her of "evading responsibility" by trying to avoid kindergarten, she responded with, "I don't know what you're talking about... I'm too young and innocent."

    Fairy Tales 

-   "Goldilocks" combines both the innocence and the folly associated with blond hair.
-   "The Grateful Beasts" has a blond hero.
    
    _"The youngest of the three brothers, whose name was Ferko, was a beautiful youth, with a splendid figure, blue eyes, fair hair, and a complexion like milk and roses."_
    
-   "The Egyptian Cinderella": Rhodopis, a Greek slave sold to Egypt, is fair-skinned with hair that is golden and curly, which sets her apart from the other servant girls in her master's household who ostracize her for her foreign looks. She is also kind-hearted and friendly with animals.
-   The innocent, pure, kind and very beautiful Rapunzel has hair "as fine as spun gold".
-   Snow White of "Snow-White and Rose-Red" is often depicted with blonde hair, both as a contrast with Rose Red and to distinguish her from another Snow White and her distinctive look.
-   Princess Diana (no, not her), the heroine of the Italian Fairy Tale "The Curse of the Seven Children", is a kind and pure-hearted girl with hair like gold.
-   In "The Buried Moon", the kind-hearted moon spirit is described as having long golden hair, equated with moonlight and illuminating a dark and sinister bog.

    Fan Works 

-   The LDD-Fanfic, _Bridge to Terabithia 2: The Last Time_ follows the 2007 Disney adaptation of _Bridge to Terabithia_, so Leslie Burke in this version follows this trope; however there's an entirely new OC, Dylan Hils, a young blonde boy which is one of the kindest, sweetest characters in the entire story so this trope applys to him as well.
-   _Child of the Storm_:
    -   Thor has a streak of Proud Warrior Race Guy in him and he's a formidable fighter, but he's mostly just a kind, loving, and lovable dad to Harry (he was incarnated as James Potter. Long story), who he takes great joy in embarrassing. He's also noted as being very good with children in general.
    -   Steve Rogers, as canon, is a classic male example - he actually rescues kittens from trees.
    -   Carol, under her spiky shell. While she is and remains a consummate Deadpan Snarker, she's also kind, protective, prone to Big Sister Instinct towards her little brothers (though she later admits that she gives them the brush-off more than she should) and any younger girl she encounters, and generally caring - something especially demonstrated in her interactions with Harry, who she handles with gentle affection (albeit sprinkled with the occasional Insult of Endearment). In fact, she's probably the main reason he's even sane after the first 20 chapters of the sequel. Since she's Steve's great-granddaughter, this is perhaps less surprising than it might be.
-   _Code Wings 3.0_ has Georgina Markson, a sandy blonde woman who is such a sweetheart.
-   _A Destroyer's Remorse_: Dirk was born with his mother's golden hair, and a heart to go with it. As he slowly started to go insane over the course of his reincarnations in Aionios, his hair faded to a dull, straw-like color.

-   Amongst the staff at the titular park in _Prehistoric Park_ fanfic _Prehistoric Earth_ are head veterinarian Linda Eberhart and her young assistant Yolanda Hall, who are both amongst the nicest and kindest characters present in the entire story.

-   From what little is known about Heather from _Ma Fille_, she was a blonde woman who loved and doted on her daughter Katrina.
-   In _Danny Phantom_ fanfic _Resurrected Memories_: The two OC's Christopher Morgan and Zoe Murray have blonde hair and are both very nice, understanding and friendly individuals. They even become Ember's friends and band mates to boot.

-   Mr. Incredible and Dash from _The Incredibles_. Though he is getting on in years and has become more cynical with time, Mr. Incredible is characterized as a stand-up, classic superhero in many ways. Dash inherits his father's blond hair, and evolves into a hero.
-   Miguel from _The Road to El Dorado_ is a male version, despite being a thief for a living. His lack of actual innocence is made up for by his genuine sweetness and optimism about the world in general. Overall he's a really good person who isn't above using puppy eyes to get his way.
-   Subverted, like many other fairy tale tropes, in the _Shrek_ series. Prince Charming has blonde hair, a rugged masculine appearance and seems to be the bold hero. But he proves to be an extremely vain, self-centered, spoiled boy, and even rises to the position of Big Bad in _Shrek the Third_.
-   _Strange Magic_: Dawn, who is a Princess Classic. She's sweet and caring with her only flaws being overly obsessed with love and a bit air headed.
-   _The Swan Princess_: Odette grows up to be a Princess Classic with long blonde locks. Even Derek, who detested her prescence growing up, falls in Love at First Sight upon seeing how beautiful she's become.

-   _Sindy The Fairy Princess_: The titular Sindy is a blonde-haired blue-eyed girl who's kindness causes the Prince to fall in love with her, averting the Wiazrd's curse from taking over.

She very naive and innocent, and she and Nick Carter (America's greatest detective) fall in Love at First Sight. When Nick needs her help and asks her if she's a brave girl, she answers with determined "I am a daughter of Jan Zizka's nation", referring to a great military leader from the Hussite Movement.

-   _Beyond Loch Ness_: Zoe is the only blonde character and is polite to her ex-boyfriend, gets along well with the foreign exchange student her family is hosting, searches determinedly for said student after she disappears, helps Brody cope with his injured leg, and risks her life to draw the monster away from other people on multiple occasions.
-   Tim Burton:
    -   Kim in _Edward Scissorhands_ is a Double Subversion. She's first seen in a family photo where Peg describes her as her pride and joy. When we meet Kim, however, she seems like a bratty teenager. But as the film goes on and she warms to Edward, she is really kind and caring, thus fitting the trope.
    -   Katrina in _Sleepy Hollow (1999)_ is an example from Tim Burton's movies, complete with an evil blonde foil. She is kind and guides the hero through the weird town. Although Burton is most associated with the Eerie Pale-Skinned Brunette look, it appears he has some fondness for blondes as well.
    -   _Alice in Wonderland (2010)_. Alice is adult and returned to Wonderland. She's a good and heroic variety of blondes.
-   _Carrie (1976)_: Carrie herself is famously like this, up until that one scene.
-   _Dance of the Dead_: Blonde-haired Gwen is a Pom-Pom Girl and Friend to All Living Things who is friendly with the geeky students even before they end up fighting zombies alongside of each other.
-   The Angel in _Date with an Angel_ is played by a platinum blonde _Emmanuelle Béart_, perfectly embodying this trope.
-   In the movie _Dear John_, Savannah is naive, kind, and morally upstanding. A case of Adaptation Dye-Job because she was a brunette in the book.
-   _Giant Little Ones_: Natasha is blonde, and a kind, friendly girl who's sweet to Franky when everyone else shuns him, becoming his girlfriend.
-   Amy Kane (Grace Kelly) in _High Noon_. Initially portrayed as innocent and naive, she proves to be the only person willing to help her husband fight the villains.
-   _The Hunger Games_: Prim is a compassionate young blonde girl who loves all living creatures and becomes a good healer at an early age, often helping her mother with patients. When Katniss leaves her family she doesn't bother suggesting that Prim learn to hunt because her attempts were disastrous, since the woods terrified Prim and whenever Katniss shot something it would make Prim teary and she'd talk about how they might be able to heal it.
-   _It's a Wonderful Knife (2023)_: Winnie is a blonde teenage girl who's usually very friendly and kind.

-   _La Famille Bélier_: Paula is a hard-working girl with dreams of her own and has light blonde hair.
-   The eponymous blonde from _Legally Blonde_, Elle Woods, averts the stereotype of the bitchy, stuck up sorority girl. Throughout the movie she is shown to be a kind and generous friend who doesn't discard people based solely on appearances like her pompous ex Warner.
-   Virginal Winifred Goodman in _Lemonade Joe_ has long fair hair and she's very sweet wholesome all-american girl, and admired by many. The villainous Horace Badman alias Hogo Fogo uses her good heart and compassion. He's disguised as an old blind man and kidnaps her. It's part of his plan to bring down her fiancé Lemonade Joe, and he has his private plans with Winifred.
    
    **Doug Badman**: It makes me sick whenever I think about that dirty trick of yours with that pure and innocent girl.  
    **Horace Badman**: Purity and innocence? What goodies for a pervert of _my_ calibre!
    
-   Aurora in _Maleficent_, unsurprisingly, as she's more or less the same person as in Sleeping Beauty.
-   Manon of _Manon of the Spring_ (_Manon des Sources_) is proud, beautiful, and no man's fool—but she is also good-natured at heart and righteous. Her role, in juxtaposition to the other characters, is basically purity personified.
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_
    -   Steve Rogers aka Captain America of _Captain America: The First Avenger_ who is also a example of Incorruptible Pure Pureness, however subverted over time as his hair darkens, he grows a Beard of Sorrow and thanks to his actions becomes somewhat an Anti-Hero. In _Avengers: Endgame_ Steve’s hair is blonder again signifying his return to grace.
    -   Thor Odinson is very good example especially when he takes a level in kindness, it helps that Thor is very attached to his golden locks and has a meltdown when Stan Lee is shearing them off. Out-of-Universe despite Chris Hemsworth being all for getting rid of the hair in _Thor: Ragnarok_, he joked that he kept the blonde wig for his wife. Though in _Endgame_ Thor's shaggy blonde hair returns.
    -   Frigga's Thor and Loki's mother is very much this trope, Thor appears to have inherited her hair color, good looks, and kind nature... Loki got her sorcery and _some_ of the aforementioned traits. Frigga's pure nature shows though her actions i.e forgiving Loki, ripping into her husband Odin for banishing Thor in a deleted scene, accepting Jane and sacrificing her life to save her from Malekith. She also gets Thor out of his depression in _Endgame_.
    -   Maria Stark in contrast to the jerky qualities of her husband and son was an absolute angel and served as the glue keeping the family together. Maria's significance to her son Tony is especially felt when he beat the shit out of Bucky Barnes when Tony discovered he strangled Maria in 1991.
    -   Black Widow bleaches her blonde while living off the grid as a fugitive in _Avengers: Infinity War_ and she's still as compassionate as ever albeit a trained killer.
    -   Played with in regards to Carol Danvers aka _Captain Marvel (2019)_ she can pretty dickish and cold at times, but that’s just masking a inner compassion which is brought out of her by her loved ones and innocents being in danger. Given her past, Carol’s attitude isn’t too hard to understand.
-   _Money Talks:_ Grace has blonde hair and is affectionate with her fiancee, friendly with Franklin, and quick to defend James and Franklin once their secrets are exposed.

-   Pretty much any character played by Annasophia Robb, but especially her roles in _Bridge to Terabithia_ and _The Way, Way Back_.
    -   Averted with her role as Violet Beauregarde in _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_, where she was notably nastier than her book counterpart and stood out compared to the other child actors, claiming that she will always be a winner, calling Charlie a "loser" at one point, and showing off as she leaves the factory by cartwheeling.
-   Rosemary in _Shallow Hal_ is blonde, kind, and generous.
-   Grace in _Short Term 12_. A sort of female Andy Dufresne who bucks the system in order to help the troubled orphans whom only she seems to truly understand (due to her having been one herself).
-   The female bodybuilder Loonie Jones, played by Raye Hollitt, in _Skin Deep_. Although her muscular appearance intimidates Zach a little, Lonnie, who is blond, is also kind and generous.
-   Ursula Ditkovitch in _Spider-Man 2_ and _Spider-Man 3_ is very kind and supportive to Peter (even giving him cake and milk when he's depressed), and has long blonde hair that she wears in pigtails.
-   _Star Wars_
    -   When young Anakin meets the heroes and brings them to his home in _The Phantom Menace_ he volunteers to race in the Boonta Eve Classic podrace so that they could get the prize money.

    -   Luke Skywalker The Hero was the literal poster boy<small>◊</small> for this trope in the _Star Wars: A New Hope_ though his hair darkens over the course of the later movies and he gets a Beard of Sorrow in _The Last Jedi_.
-   In _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_, Johanna is _definitely_ one of these, fitting the innocent, child-womanish category almost to a T. Johanna got this from her mother, Lucy, who is described by Sweeney as "beautiful" and "virtuous" at the start of the whole thing, if something of a "silly little nit" according to Mrs. Lovett. Of course, in the stage play, Johanna gets one of the two kills that Sweeney doesn't get when she guns down the asylum keeper Jonas Fogg.
-   _Sweet, Sweet Lonely Girl_: Adele starts out as a very sweet blonde young woman who cares for her aunt, who's quite ill. Influenced by Beth however, she becomes far more callous to the point of her neglect killing her aunt.
-   _Valentine_: Kate Davies has long blonde hair and the only one among her group of friends who isn't a Jerkass (contrast with her friend Lily who is also blonde, airheaded, and makes fun of someone she bullied in school). Two acts of kindness during Kate's childhood wind up paying her dividends in the present day because she was the only one who was nice to the Big Bad when they were children, even when she rejected him, and wasn't part of the False Rape Accusation that ruined his life.
-   _Vamps_: Blonde-haired Goody is arguably the nicest character in the movie.
-   _Yellow Hair and the Fortress of Gold_: Yellow Hair is noted in her introduction to be heroic and indeed is a very nice young woman.

    Literature 

-   _Bad News Ballet_: Mary Bubnik is the only blonde of the gang and is bubbly, kind, and friendly to everyone—even when they don't truly deserve it.
-   Zig-Zagged with Laura Steele from _Bone Song_. She's a beautiful blonde woman... who also happens to be a zombie with a black heart and black blood, and her character is far from innocent (she can be sarcastic and somewhat acerbic at times). However, she retains her human personality, has genuine feelings for her friends and her human lover, and as a police task officer, she does the best for society and catches dangerous criminals. So in the metaphorical sense, she _does_ have a heart of gold.
-   _A Court of Thorns and Roses_: Tamlin is blond and generally kind and well-meaning. At least, until he Took a Level in Jerkass in the second book.
-   A rare older and male example in _Less_. Arthur Less (49) has pale blonde hair and bright blue eyes, and is described as "a man utterly without armor" against the often-harsh world he lives in. A major part of Arthur's character arc is attempting to reconcile his sweet nature with his personal failings, and eventually learning that he doesn't need to.
-   In _The Little Prince_, the Little Prince is depicted as having golden hair and is a symbol of innocence and childhood.
-   In C. S. Lewis' _The Chronicles of Narnia_, the innocent Lucy, who first finds Narnia and is closest to Aslan, is described (near the end of the first novel) as having blond hair. However, the illustrations by Pauline Baynes show her with black hair and pigtails. The only adaptation that actually has her as a blonde is the 1970s animated film.
-   In _The Clique_ novels, Claire Lyons has light blonde hair and is the nicest member of the Pretty Commitee.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: Generally, hair color is not a guarantee of characterization, but preconceptions about it still abound.
    -   Sansa initially Thinks Like a Romance Novel and romanticizes Cersei and Joffrey's golden hair as part of her fantasy of going to King's Landing and becoming a princess. Although Joffrey and Cersei subvert her expectations by being terrible people, the youngest royals Prince Tommen and Princess Myrcella play this trope straight by being kindhearted and sweet by all accounts.
    -   The trope is referenced when a bard writes a propagandized ballad about the Battle of Blackwater. The lyrics make a big deal of the handsome, young, golden-haired prince (Joffrey) and equally golden-haired mother (Cersei) going up against his wicked, black-haired uncle.
    -   Exploited by Tyene Sand along with Innocent Blue Eyes. She's described as beautiful, sweet, and pious-looking, and you'll believe that right until you realize she's already poisoned you.
-   _This Side of Paradise_: The blonde Clara Page is full of goodness and purity that puts her above the questionable morals of a desperate husband-seeker and people flock to her because of her kindness. When Amory, who was charmed by her kindness, is rejected by her, he chants about gold, alluding to her golden hair and how he wanted her.
-   Evangeline in _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ has golden hair and is an angelic mouthpiece for the author's anti-slavery message. For extra points, she's Too Good for This Sinful Earth.
-   _Little Lord Fauntleroy_ is famous for the titular character's blond, curly hair. He's a sweet but a bit precocious boy who lives up to his aristocratic heritage and his family expectations.
-   In the _The Demon Princes_, Alusz Iphigenia Eperje-Tokay has dusty blond hair and ggray eyes. She's beautiful, intelligent, gently bred and fatalistic.
-   Emma Woodhouse of Jane Austen's _Emma_ is interested in befriending a girl of lower social standing than herself, Harriet Smith, specifically because of Harriet's beauty. Harriet has Hair of Gold and big Innocent Blue Eyes, and her nature is very sweet, timid and affectionate. She's glad that so great a lady as Emma notices her and happily lets Emma lead and guide her.
-   In _Goblin Market_, Laura's golden hair is a key part of the plot, because she buys fruit with "a golden curl" rather than with actual money. Using her hair this way leads to the loss of innocence (and, metaphorically, her virginity).
-   In the J. R. R. Tolkien's Legendarium:
    -   Most of elves are dark-haired, so the golden ones stand out, and it tends to be symbolic. In _The Silmarillion_, this is the hallmark of the Houses of Ingwë and Finarfin, and they are of the High Elven houses the wisest, kindest, least rash, and (in the case of the Exiles) most friendly and helpful to mortals. One of those (Galadriel) even survived long enough to appear in _The Lord of the Rings_.
    -   Ingwë, and his people (the Vanyar) in general, are noted as the wisest and most holy of the High Elves. They live exclusively in Valinor itself. Every one of them chose to come to Valinor instead of staying behind in Middle-earth, and only a small handful joined the rebellion of the Noldor. Which is why they get the least page-time of the three clans.
    -   Of the Noldorin royalty, Finarfin's family are the wisest, and he was the only major character who quit the rebellion and returned to Valinor to humbly ask the Valar for pardon before it was too late. Thus, they made him king of what was left of his people. His kids all continued with the rebellion but were the most reluctant to participate (other than Galadriel, who was just itching to leave).
    -   Galadriel's hair is literally luminescent, and said to have been like "a mesh of gold" with the light of Laurelin (a holy golden tree that served as a precursor to the sun) bound up in it. Her part in the Fall of the Noldor changed as Tolkien's concept of her character evolved—in most versions she's a leader of the rebellion and more eager than her brothers to leave Valinor. Later, Tolkien decided she was entirely innocent of any wrongdoing, and planned to change the stories to say she didn't participate in the rebellion, but only happened to leave Valinor at the same time.
    -   Averted with Celegorm the Fair, the only one of the seven sons of Fëanor to have blond hair, and quite possibly the worst of them.
-   In _The Phantom of the Opera_ Christine Daae is described as having golden blonde hair which matches her affectionate loving nature (given she can show pity to the deformed Erik), further more, Christine’s hair also fits in with the novel’s themes of light and dark. The Musical and live-action versions don't give a hoot for this however and tend to make Christine brunette in almost all portrayals.
    -   If we apply this trope's logic to the Broadway Musical, then Little Meg is very much this trope.
-   The teen hero _Michael Vey_ who is one of the sweetest, nicest characters in the series. He can get angry and be pushed, but he is very forgiving and despite growing more experienced and smarter over the series never loses his kind spirit and never crosses over to becoming the more cynical Pragmatic Hero.
-   Maybeth, the third sibling in _The Tillerman Family Series_ by Cynthia Voigt, is practically angelic by description, both in personality and appearance.
-   _Les Misérables_:
    -   Fantine is noted for her beauty and particularly her long, angelic golden hair. She is presented as the model of motherly virtue, and at the beginning of her transition to Broken Bird she sells her beautiful hair to provide for her daughter Cosette.
    -   Cosette herself is described as brunette in the text, but in the musical and other adaptations is often played by a blonde actress because of this trope.
    -   Enjolras has Hair Of Gold and is explicitly a Chaste Hero.
-   Lucy Westenra in the novel _Dracula_ is blonde. Dr Seward makes a reference to her hair lying on her pillow in "sunny ripples", but after she becomes an evil vampire eyewitnesses describe her as having dark hair.
-   _A Brother's Price_:
    -   Little Eldie Porter, five years old, has blonde, curly hair and entirely innocent in her parents' scheming. It does get dyed black by the end.
    -   Averted with her uncle, Keifer Porter, who had the same hair colour but was a jerk. He's also Eldie's father, via Kij.
    -   Played straight with Cullen Moorland, who is a nice, a bit hyperactive and childish young man with honey-coloured hair.
-   Prim and Mrs. Everdeen in _The Hunger Games_. Prim is a compassionate young blonde girl with blue eyes. She loves all living creatures. She was also a good healer at an early age, often helping her mother with patients. When Katniss leaves her family she doesn't bother suggesting that Prim learn to hunt because her attempts were disastrous. The woods terrified her and whenever Katniss shot something it would make Prim teary and she'd talk about how they might be able to heal it. Katniss is always amazed when her mother brought a wounded or sick patient: "she morphs from someone who calls her daughter to kill a spider to a woman immune to fear", Katniss says.
-   Both Laurana and Goldmoon in the _Dragonlance_ books are naive but kind beautiful blond princesses (elf and barbarian human, respectively). The former especially was naive and sheltered to the point of being an airhead while the latter was actually worshipped as a goddess by her tribe. They both grew out of it into an Action Girl and Messianic Archetype, respectively.
-   Susan, Roland's Lost Lenore, in _The Dark Tower_, has blonde hair. She's 16, innocent and noble. About the only thing we know about her appearance other than her beauty is that she has long blonde hair. The villain of her story tries to hypnotize her into cutting it all off.

-   _Song at Dawn_: Much is made of Alis' blond hair and 'Daddy's little angel' often follows it. She also has a frail constitution.
-   _Anna Karenina_: Kitty is a beautiful, kind and feminine girly girl, greatly admired in society for her beauty and grace. When she gets disappointed in love by her suitor, she becomes ill, but her parents take her to a spa and she recovers.
-   In _Gelsomino in Land of Liars_, Gelsomino's golden hair corresponds with his character: sweet, kind-hearted and generally helpful. This is contrasted with Big Bad Jakomone, whose golden hair is fake.
-   Clover from _Entwined_ is blond and in no short supply of suitors and can barely say a bad word about someone.
-   Werner Von Ebrannac in the World War II novella _Le Silence de la mer_ is a soft-spoken Francophile Friend to All Children with naive hopes of amity with his unwilling French hosts who ends up suffering a Heel Realisation.
-   _A Necklace of Fallen Stars_: Melina has blonde hair and is one of the kindest characters in the book. Kippen is blond as well, and he's a pretty gentle soul too.
-   In _White as Snow_, Coira dreams that her real mother is a beautiful young blonde woman who is kind and gentle and loving. She imagines that this woman died and Arpazia took her place.
-   In _Rachel Griffin_, Nastasia Romanov, Princess of Magical Australia, is a gracious, gentle, ladylike, dutiful and kind Princess Classic, with very long ash-blond hair.
-   In _The Wee Free Men_, Tiffany Aching, who has brown hair and brown eyes, notices that in the book of fairy tales her mother read to her, all the princesses and "good" characters had blond hair and blue eyes (or possibly red hair and green eyes), and that the best you could hope for otherwise was to be an inkeeper or a maid—or a witch.
-   Celine Herondale from _The Mortal Instruments_, had blonde hair, and according to Jocelyn was sweet, lovely, and made everyone want to protect her.
-   _Vampire Academy_:
    -   Lissa Dragomir is kind-hearted and blonde. She has angelic-looking blonde hair and typically goes out of her way to care for people and animals.
    -   Eddie Castile. Described as blonde and one of the nicest guys Rose knows. He is very kind-hearted and protective of his friends, and is even willing to sacrifice his own career opportunities to help them.
-   In _Dragon Bones_, Ward's younger sister Ciarra has blonde hair. She's the most innocent character in the novel, being one of two people who are mentioned to never have killed before (she's too young and a girl, her brother Tosten is rather sensitive and earns his living as a bard). She's also a Cute Mute, and the victim of choice for a jerkass god who needs to take possession of someone to talk to the heroes. Even the Genius Loci of castle Hurog, Oreg, likes Ciarra, and protects her in subtle ways. She also seems to be the one person he has always been visible to. (Usually he can only be seen by his master, the owner of castle Hurog.)
-   In _The Dragon Hoard_, Princess Goodness has hair "just the colour of summer sunlight" in the first chapter and "bright golden as a buttercup" in the last, and lives up to her name.
-   Subverted in, of all people, H. P. Lovecraft's _Sweet Ermengarde_, a parody of Melodrama. Ermengarde _portrays_ herself as this, but the hair colour comes out of a bottle, and the heart isn't as innocent as she likes to pretend either...
-   _Land of Oz_:
    -   Dorothy's hair colour is never mentioned in text, but a large amount of illustrations depict her this way. She's an innocent, sweet-hearted child from Kansas who is always up to adventure and enjoys helping others.
    -   The one time the young princess of Oz, Princess Ozma's, hair colour is mentioned, she's referred to as a blonde. Ozma is the sweetest person in Oz and is only matched by Glinda the Good for her beauty. In practice, however, illustrations consistently depict Ozma as a brunette.
-   Hans and Petra in _Caliphate_ are two German siblings who are described as having blonde hair and despite all the horrors they suffer in their lives (Hans is brainwashed to be a janissary while his sister becomes a sex slave), they remain fundamentally good and heroic people. Petra for example when she witnesses several janissary soldiers dying horribly, rather than feeling joy over enforcers of the Caliphate that brought such misery to her being killed this way, she pities them because they were just as victims like she was; meanwhile, her brother rebels against the corrupt and decayed regime he is forced to serve and joins the Americans in their mission to save the world.
-   The sweet, harmless Darek from _Devils & Thieves_ is always mentioned as having blonde hair. It serves to contrast him from the dark-haired and mysterious Crowe, showing him to be the nice and tame option. This is subverted; Darek turns out to be the villain, and an expert manipulator, who only _seemed_ like a nice guy.
-   Janet from _Hetty Feather_. Endlessly kind and supportive of Hetty, and keeps her own unrequited love for Jem buried in the hopes of Jem being happy with Hetty instead. Hell, Janet attempts to convince her _romantic rival to stay_ in the village for _Jem's sake_, showing how she put Jem's needs before herself constantly.
-   Hanami of _Tasakeru_ fits the bill: an Innocent Flower Girl with a shy nature and long blonde hair, the color of which is unique in the setting.
-   Luna Lovegood in _Harry Potter_. Sure, she's a bit of an oddball at times, but is one of the most lovably sweet characters in the series, as shown when she believes Harry about Voldemort's return at a time when almost nobody does and offers him some comforting words after Sirius' death. She even went as far as decorating her room with portraits of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville with the word "friends" connecting them, showing how much she values their friendship.
-   _Just Juliet_: Juliet is a blonde and a very kind girl.
-   Amy from _Space Glass_ is the kindest character in the cast, and has the brightest blonde hair among them. She is usually seen fighting only when her friends are in danger.
-   _Goblins in the Castle_: Not exactly _gold_, but William is easily one of the nicest people in the series, and is known for his butter-colored hair.
-   _The Stormlight Archive_: Evi Kholin had golden-blonde hair (an extreme rarity in the part of Roshar where the story takes place) and was among the kindest and gentlest characters we've seen so far. Similarly, her son Adolin has mostly blonde hair, and is noted as particularly friendly and gregarious.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Kenneth Parcel from _30 Rock_ is a male example. He's innocent, idealistic, loves everyone, and shows Incorruptible Pure Pureness all throughout the series.
-   Cassiopeia in _Battlestar Galactica_, who decides to abandon her life as a Socialator to become a Med Tech. Other than her past life, she is sweet and kind, often looks after Boxey and even takes care of an ill-ridden Adama in "The Young Lords".
-   Lucrezia in _The Borgias_ starts out this way, although between her abusive first marriage and scheming family it doesn't last.
-   _The Boys (2019)_: Very much averted with Homelander. He presents himself this way but is easily the most sadistic of The Seven. Starlight, on the other hand, tries to be good of an example although she's part of the seven.
-   All three daughters on _The Brady Bunch_ have "...hair of gold, like their mother". This is because the four are the innocent girls, while all the boys have dark brown/black hair (they even colored Mike Lookinland's hair from its natural reddish for the first season).
-   Despite working for years in the worst slums of London's East End, _Call the Midwife_'s young, lovely, devoted, soft-spoken Sister Bernadette remains as kind and hopeful as ever, her spirit shining as brightly as her seldom-seen golden hair. After enduring a crisis of faith over her calling when she falls in love with local physician Dr. Turner, she comes out of it radiantly in love and determined to continue serving God as a wife, mother, and midwife.
-   Diane Chambers of _Cheers_. During her years at the bar, she's essentially the Nice Girl and a Wide-Eyed Idealist who cares—deeply—for the others.
-   _CSI: NY_: Christine Whitney (Mac Taylor's girlfriend from seasons 8 & 9) is a warm, loving, compassionate blonde who endears herself to his team as soon as they meet her. She then puts her entire life on hold for 6 months to nurse Mac back to health after he's shot and almost dies. Later, when he shuts her out for a while due to repercussions from that, she does give him the cold shoulder for a couple of weeks, but then forgives him _overnight_ once he seeks her out and admits what's going on. The final scene of the series has her happily accepting his proposal.
-   _Degrassi_ has had three female characters that fit this mold.
    -   The first was Emma Nelson, who was a trusting Soapbox Sadie nature lover until reality happened and she fell off the path. She fit up until Season 3 or 4, when she suddenly went to all sorts of impure, corrupt places and it went downhill from there.
    -   Then came Maya Matlin, a cute innocent band geek. She still mostly fits the mold but she's shown to have some bite to her when pushed, but her intentions stay mostly good. And it didn't take much to put her back on track.
    -   The writers played with this when Becky Baker was introduced, the faithful Christian. She's a "playing with" example because several of her actions qualify as bigoted and evil, but at the same time her intentions were pure, just her reasoning and understanding was misguided. Once she learned better, she's just as optimistic and innocent as ever.
-   Subverted in _Dead of Summer_: Amy Hughes was initially presented as a sweet, wholesome blonde girl who just wanted to be friends with everyone. Then "Home Sweet Home" revealed that she was actually an Ax-Crazy sociopath who had been secretly responsible for every terrible thing that had happened thus far.
-   In the _Doctor Who_ episode _The King's Demons_, Hugh has this—a young knight valiant in his defense of his father.
    -   One might argue that the Fifth Doctor belongs on this list. Peri thinks that he was sweet (a fact rebutted by the Sixth Doctor as more effete than sweet).
    -   The kind and considerate Thirteenth Doctor seems to qualify as well.
    -   Also the sweet and bubbly Jo Grant, companion to the Third Doctor, noted for her undying loyalty to the Doctor and her incredibly warm relationship with him.
-   Camille from _Emily in Paris_ is bubbly, kind, and beautiful with pale blonde hair.
-   Elyse Keaton from _Family Ties_ fits the trope being a loving mother, an Actual Pacifist due to her flower child background, and in general is a very kind-hearted and warm person.
    -   The youngest son, Andy combines this trope with Adorably Precocious Child and Children Are Innocent.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Tommen and Myrcella are sweet, innocent, big-hearted blond children despite all the negative influences around them.
    -   Daenerys' silver-blonde (ironically for the name of this trope) hair is one of her and her House's most iconic traits, and despite her ups and downs, she's one of the most fundamentally good-hearted and caring characters on the show.
-   A literal angel Aziraphale from _Good Omens (2019)_.
-   Don "Doc" Dogoier of _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_ stands out among his crew of pirates for being kind, gentle, shy, cheerful, and peace-loving—even more so than supposed Token Good Teammate (and dark-haired) Ahim, who has proven herself to have a devious side that Don doesn't share.
-   _LazyTown_: Ziggy has blonde hair, and is the youngest and kindest of LazyTown's children.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   Trish Walker from _Jessica Jones_ is a more combative version of this (even taking krav maga lessons!). Specially in regards to Aloof Dark-Haired Girl Jessica, who Trish wished that could be heroic instead of a cynical anti-heroine.
    -   Karen Page from _Daredevil (2015)_
-   _Murdoch Mysteries_:
    -   Anna Fulford is a very young and very beautiful blonde with curly hair. She intuitively recognized that Detective Murdoch (suffering from Identity Amnesia) is a good man, even though he was pursued by men who claimed he's a killer, and she decided to help him. She's a bit livelier that this archetype tends to be but she fits the trope very well.
    -   Mrs Enid Jones is very young, beautiful, and generally sweet and kind. She looks very timid and feminine, but she can take a good care of herself and her son. She has curly blond hair.
-   _The New Normal_ has Goldie, a straight ally to gay couple David and Bryan. She stands up to her bigoted grandmother for them, and carries their baby.
-   Sharon, Carmen's naive Anglo friend in _¿Qué Pasa, U.S.A.?_, qualifies. When Adela is overwrought about her friend's death, Sharon acts more sympathetic than Adela's own grandchildren and expresses sincere condolences in her best (if awful) Spanish:
    
    **Sharon**: _Yo muy_ sorry _de_ you _amiga_!
    
-   In Victorian flashbacks, _Sanctuary_'s Helen Magnus has long, curly blond hair. She's also more soft-spoken, cheerful, and younger (obviously) than in the present. Sometime after discovering that her fiancé is Jack the Ripper and being contracted by the Crown to kill Adam Worth, she goes brunette. She also has red hair during World War II.
-   Joceyln Schitt on _Schitt's Creek_ occassionally gets stressed out, but she is unfailingly a devoted teacher, mother, friend and wife. She puts up with an awful lot from her best friend, Moira.
-   Gina on _Sesame Street_ is a very compassionate and kind-hearted veterinarian.
-   _Stargirl (2020)_: Despite her bratty attitude, Courtney still has her moments especially when she cares about her friends and family.
-   Despite being a Cowboy Cop who along with his partner seems to get around, Ken Hutchinson from _Starsky & Hutch_ fits the bill as a male example. Jokes were made about his hair, too—mainly by Starsky.
-   Jessica and Mary in _Supernatural_ have long blonde hair. Both of these women are killed off in the Pilot, and the loss of these kind loved characters serves as motivation for Sam and Dean to hunt demons.
-   Henry VIII sees Jane Seymour as this in _The Tudors_. In season 3, it becomes clear she has a little more depth, but Henry reacts aggresively to any indication that she doesn't agree with him. When she returns briefly in season 4, she's the only ghost Henry seems happy to see. Unfortunately for him, she is not as meek as before.
-   _The Walking Dead (2010)_: Princes Benjamin and Henry of the Kingdom. Both are idealistic, noble, selfless, kind hearted, and compassionate. Both represent the future of The Kingdom. Both also sadly were killed because of the harsher nature of others.
-   _The X-Files_: The Serial Killer in the episode "Elegy" targets very young and beautiful women who have blond hair and who were very kind. They were all friends with a mentally handicapped man who was in love with them.
-   Gabrielle in _Xena: Warrior Princess_, Xena's faithful companion and friend.

    Music 

-   Dolly Parton can accurately be described this way. Not only does she have many songs with plenty of heart and actual blonde hair (not to mention her extensive collection of blonde wigs), she can really lift anyone's spirits in more ways than one.
-   The girl described in Eric Clapton's "Wonderful Tonight" (actually his then-wife, and muse, Pattie Boyd).
    
    _"She puts on her makeup and brushes her long blond hair..."_
    
-   In the Pentangle song "Cruel Sister", the good, innocent sister who is "loved above all things" by the prince is repeatedly described as having bright golden hair. Her evil sister is repeatedly described as having black hair and being cold and dark. The story is taken from a Child Ballad called "The Twa Sisters".
-   Claude Debussy's composition _"La fille aux cheveux de lin"_ (_The Girl with the Flaxen Hair_), from the _First Book of Preludes_.
-   _COMMUNICATIONS_: Stephanie Glass, who has platinum blonde hair and is genuinely nice.
-   Princess Riliane from _Evillious Chronicles_, though starting out as the opposite trope, becomes this after losing her brother, kingdom, and everything she valued, becoming a kind-hearted nun who spent her life raising orphans.

    Musical Theater 

-   Kendra from _13_ fits this because she's very trusting, though it doesn't work out for her, although she can be quite ditzy at times...
-   Philia from _A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum_ is beautiful, innocent, friendly, and a Dumb Blonde.
-   In _Jasper in Deadland_, Agnes Fairchild refers to her hair as "hair dyed mellow yellow".
-   Audrey from _Little Shop of Horrors_, a lovable Dumb Blonde.
-   Johanna from _Sweeney Todd_ has beautiful blonde hair like her mother, and is an archetypal Victorian-era ingenue.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Demeter in Classical Mythology is one of the few non-Jerkass Gods in the Olympian Pantheon. And explicitly described as a blonde. (Wheat-blond; after all, she's the wheat goddess)
-   Lady Sif in Norse Mythology has beautiful blonde hair in the Norse Myths which may come as a surprise to those familiar with the brunette Marvel Universe portrayal. Sif's hair appears to represent fields of golden wheat, that she may be associated with fertility, family and wedlock... so of course Loki shears Sif's curls off.
-   Inverted in Heinrich Heine's ballad "The Loreley": Loreley sits at the top of her cliff combing her golden hair (with a golden comb to boot), and this is one of the reasons why the hapless skippers cannot take their eyes off her. Unfortunately, Loreley is not as innocent or kind as she looks, because the ships which shatter on the river below seem not to bother her at all.

    Puppet Shows 

-   Naive, innocent Wembley, the youngest member of _Fraggle Rock_'s Five-Man Band, has yellow hair.
-   Janice from _The Muppet Show_ can fit under here as well, as she is kind and laid back.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Primarch Sanguinius from _Warhammer 40,000_ is a male example. The long-haired blonde is one of the most unambiguously good people in the otherwise morally dark grey crapsack galaxy of _Warhammer 40,000_. He is even known in-universe as "The Pure One", and naturally he gives up his life to save humanity.

    Theatre 

-   _Which Witch The Musical_: In most productions Maria has either blonde or strawberry blonde hair.

    Video Games 

-   _Baldur's Gate II_: Aerie is a lawful good avariel (an elf with wings), who lost her ability to fly when she was captured and imprisoned until her wings got infected and had to be removed. She was later freed by Quayle, who she sees as a foster father and deeply loves. She often suffers because she can no longer see the world from above, but she's still kind-hearted, sweet, and willing to do good things and help people. In _Throne of Bhaal_ she grows more confident and capable of standing on her own and look for herself.
-   In _BoxxyQuest: The Gathering Storm_, Tyalie has bright blond hair to match her equally bright and sunny personality.
-   _Chrono Trigger_: Ayla is a beautiful and athletic blonde cavewoman who is very friendly and kind to anyone she meets and fights to protect her friends and tribe.
-   The _Dark Parables_ version of Rapunzel, first encountered in the seventh game, very much falls into this category. Her long golden hair is, of course, the stuff of legends, and she has healing magic which makes her a Friend to All Living Things, as well as a sweet disposition which leads everyone to love her (even her younger half-sister, Belladonna, who hates just about everyone). Judging by some memorials found in the game, it's apparently In the Blood; her mother, Queen Violante, was the same way.
-   In _Devilish Hairdresser_, the Angelic Hairdresser is (usually) blonde. Fitting for an Angel, she's gentle and kind, and disapproves of the Devilish Hairdresser's tricks.
-   _Dragon Quest V_: Bianca Whitaker has blond hair and she's a very kind, spunky lady who is willing to go into a haunted castle and fight ghosts to save a kitten _when she is eight_.
-   _Far Cry_:
    -   Daisy Lee, Grant Brody's girlfriend from _Far Cry 3_. A friendly blonde woman and the second-kindest character after Jason's brunette girlfriend Liza Snow, she's the main force holding her traumatized friends together and finding a way for them to get off the Rook Islands while Jason's off killing pirates.
    -   _Far Cry 5_:
        -   Invoked with Faith Seed, who has a very angelic look with blonde hair and wearing an white dress appropriate for her name, but she is in reality a murderous psycho who uses her sweet appearance to get her victims off guard.
        -   Mary May Fairgrave plays this straight in contrast to Faith, being a golden-haired pillar of the Fall's End community who would go to any lengths to protect those close to her.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Aria Bennett, one of the Guest Star Party Members in _Final Fantasy III_. She's a priestess of the water crystal and a white-clad White Mage. Whenever you talk to her, she says very nice things about how the party is blessed with the light.
    -   Krile of _Final Fantasy V_ is a cute and sweet young girl who is a Friend to All Living Things with the ability to speak to them. She can also communicate with benevolent ghosts and plays the medium for her friends. She also becomes the youngest member of the party.
    -   Terra/Tina from _Final Fantasy VI_, though her sprites have green hair, her concept art has her with blonde hair <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  she's a young, innocent, motherly, young woman who hates fighting, though she will fight to protect her friends and family. The game also has Celes, who is described as having a spirit as pure as snow, in spite of being a battle hardened soldier.
    -   Cloud from _Final Fantasy VII_ after he gets over his cocky "in for the money" attitude and becomes the compassionate (even occasionally goofy) leader for his friends; heck, the jerk mercenary act is just a cover for how much he wants to be accepted and loved (plus he has Fake Memories). Cloud, like Aeirth, also has some Messianic traits i.e being raised by single mother with no father and being the chosen hero of the Gaia (the planet).
    -   Zidane from _Final Fantasy IX_ is very outgoing, generally friendly to those around him regardless of being a thief. Though he does lean towards being a Handsome Lech at times, though considering his otherwise good nature that makes Zidane more of a Chivalrous Pervert than anything else. Like Cloud, he also tries to conceal his insecurities and fight them alone.
    -   _Final Fantasy X_ has Tidus and Rikku, who are the most childish and tender-hearted members of The Team. Tidus, like other male examples above, hides pains behind a mask of cheeriness, but when the situation turns sour, Tidus goes above and beyond to protect his loved ones. Rikku, though she is a Yuffie-esque thief type, is highly compassionate and sabotages Yuna's pilgrimage only because Rikku knows it will result in the Summoner's death.
        -   Worth noting Tidus technically bleached his hair blonde, but since his character is meant to represent the Sun anyway, the trope is still in effect regardless.

-   Cosmos from _Dissidia Final Fantasy_ and its prequel. As part of her image as a deity of harmony, she is kind, beautiful, and vaguely motherly.

-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   The bishops Lady Edain of Jungby and Father Claude of Edda from _Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War_: both blonde, both calm, gentle and caring.
    -   The bishop Lucius of _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_ has long, blond hair (as well as Innocent Blue Eyes), and he's one of the gentlest, most compassionate Nice Guys in the series, to the point that he immediately forgives the man responsible for killing his father and getting him sent to an Orphanage of Fear.
    -   Continuing the trend, the cleric Natasha of _Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones_ is also blonde (it seems a common hair color for people from Grado), and is noted by other characters for her kindness and compassion, sometimes even in detriment of herself, since she _can't_ turn a blind eye to people who need help.
    -   Libra the warpriest from _Fire Emblem: Awakening_ may carry an axe, but he is as kind and gentle and thoughtful as a Lucius expy ought to be.
    -   Chrom's sisters, Lissa and Emmeryn, of _Awakening_. Emmeryn's kindness as exalt is so well-known to even outsiders like Panne. Lissa is often described as one of the nicest people around and is down-to-earth despite her status as royalty.
    -   Princess Elise from _Fire Emblem Fates_. Sweet, cheerful, innocent, and one of the army's best healers. She's also the only royal sibling who never appears as a boss or an enemy on any of the three given routes, and during _Birthright_ she defies her father and her siblings to help the player character and the Hoshidans by guiding them through the underground city and trying to convince Xander and Garon to lay down their arms. It fails miserably and she ends up dead.
-   The first _Galaxy Angel_ trilogy features Lushati, the administrator of Library in Planet Juno. She's sweet and soft-spoken, and due to her sheltered life she's also rather naive at times. This makes her easy prey for Wein's manipulations.
    -   On the sequel trilogy, _Galaxy Angel II_, there's Kahlua Marjoram, who is also blond-haired and perhaps the kindest among the Rune Angels, always showing herself caring and generous with everyone. She heavily contrasts with her Sexier Alter Ego Tequila, who is more assertive (and has purple hair instead of blond).
-   The Lawful Good Ky Kiske in the _Guilty Gear_ series. Especially in the "youthfully naive, angst-ridden and clueless" department.
-   The Hero from _Half-Minute Hero_. His nobility earns him respect from a Time Beast (and an extra 10 seconds on a stage where you can't reverse time).
-   _Injustice 2_: Much like her comic book counterpart, Supergirl is kind, sweet, pure and blond-haired, which makes her stand out among other Regime members, who happen to be dark-haired and are brutal and cynical. She initially serves as the Token Good Teammate for the group since she is Locked Out of the Loop about their previous crimes, but after learning about them, she promptly turns on them and joins the actual good guys.
-   Ventus from _Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep_. Blond hair, bright blue eyes, and a personality to match. Justified, however, since the darkness in his heart was taken by Master Xehanort.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   Naturally, Link is a steadfast example, as he's The Hero of Hyrule and chosen wielder of The Master Sword; which only the pure of heart may draw from its pedestal. In all incarnations besides the original two NES games, Link is a blond.
    -   In most incarnations, Princess Zelda is the fair-haired benevolent ruler of Hyrule, and often aids Link in his quests to save the kingdom. In some appearances, such as _Twilight Princess_, she's a near brunette shade of dirty blonde; but she fully retains her nobility.
    -   Also from _Twilight Princess_ is Ilia, who's Link's childhood friend. The game portrays her as selfless and giving—from tending to Epona for Link, acting as a surrogate 'big sister' figure for the other village kids, to saving Prince Ralis when she found him collapsed on the road leading to Hyrule Castle Town.
-   In _Love & Pies_, Sven has long, flowing blond hair and is more than willing to help his niece Amelia in restoring the café. He's such a kindhearted man that Amelia feels bad for him since he's one of the suspects of the arson.
-   Antoine Hardmeat from _Max Gentlemen Sexy Business!_ is one of the most unambiguously kind, compassionate, and gentle executives on your company's board, whilst having a hair of rich gold.
-   Eltariel in _Middle-earth: Shadow of War_ plays with this trope: she is a female elf with blonde hair (though obscured by her hood) that serves as an enforcer to Galadriel and devoted to fight against Sauron and his armies. She has light-associated powers granted by her lady just like you'd expect from a character such as this. With that said, she does some morally questionable things in the name of her mission such as willingly becoming Celebrimbor's host to defeat Sauron and dooming Talion because he refused to follow his own plan to take over Middle-Earth after defeating their enemy, but to her credit, she deeply regrets this and seeks to atone for these deeds.
-   Paz in _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_ acts exactly like this character type for 80% of the game. The last 20% reveals that she is a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing consciously exploiting this trope for all it is worth.
-   Lucas from _Mother 3_ has gold hair, an innocent personality, a pure mind, and, unlike Claus, stays good. Claus' hair, orange, could possibly be that way because of red (evil) mixing with blonde (purity).
-   Subverted by Vert in _Neptunia_. On one hand, she has the requisite golden hair, many NPCs admire her grace and charm, and her subjects paint her as a good ruler. On the other, her appearance (blonde hair, blue eyes, big breasts) is a deliberate Phenotype Stereotype, she's politically aggressive (Ultradimension Vert is the only CPU to take shares by military action or directly convert people of interest to her side), and on a personal level she's a very open Yaoi Fangirl and her work ethic suffers from _horrifying_ motivation issues. _Re;birth1_ dials some of her personality traits down a notch, though, and makes her play this trope straighter than her past incarnations.
-   Evan Pettiwhisker Tildrum, the Player Character of _Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom_, is a blond, blue-eyed child who strives to build a kingdom where everyone can have a Happily Ever After.
-   _Octopath Traveler_:
    -   Ophilia Clement is a kind, modest and self-sacrificing cleric with long golden hair, which provides her as a good foil to seductive odalisque Primrose Azelhart.
    -   Alfyn Greengrass is also blond, and he's a kind, cheerful, and selfless apothecary whose goal in life is to help the sick and injured, just like his childhood hero helped him, to the point that he often sells his medicines for extremely cheap (if he charges for them at all).
-   _Octopath Traveler II_ has Castti, who has blonde hair and is the kind, selfless Team Mom of the party. Several characters point out how she goes out of her way to look after everyone.
-   _Omen of Sorrow_ has Zafkiel, an female Fallen Angel that descended to Earth specifically to fight monsters and has blonde hair.
-   Another male example: Teddie from _Persona 4_ in his human form, where he appears as a blond, blue-eyed Bishōnen. Despite being very perverted and flirtatious, he cares a great deal about his friends.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Bianca from _Pokémon Black and White_ is pretty, kind, heroic, and idealistic.
    -   Lillie from _Pokémon Sun and Moon_ is another blonde character with an idealistic nature. The game opens up with her rescuing a mysterious Pokemon from the clutches of an organization. She initially hates the idea of Pokemon battles because she doesn't like the idea of them getting hurt.
    -   Gladion from the same game comes off as tough and edgy at first, but he also shows great concern for others. It turns out that both Gladion and Lillie are siblings.
-   In _Puyo Puyo_, blonde-haired Amitie is easily the kindest out of the trio of protagonists, being the most likely of the three to be nice even to her enemies and showing sadness when she thinks of forgetting, not being able to see, or otherwise being distanced from her friends.
-   Bonnie McFarlane, a blonde, is perhaps the only outright decent major character in both _Red Dead Redemption_ and _Red Dead Redemption II_. There are a lot of characters too.
-   _Resident Evil_:
    -   Sherry Birkin fits this trope like glove (especially compared to her Mad Scientist parents), she is also an example of Children Are Innocent in RE2 being a Shout-Out to Newt from _Aliens_. Sherry is so pure that Derick Simmons the Big Bad of RE6 found her "overly-kind and ultimately naive, charitable nature" disgusting.
    -   Ashley Graham from _Resident Evil 4_ while a little spoiled and childish is still a good person caught in a very bad situation, she's also more importantly innocent and quite caring.
    -   Jill Valentine's hair is turned blonde in RE5 thanks to being put in cryostasis once she gets over the Brainwashed and Crazy status Wesker put her into, Jill can be considered this trope as her kind nature returns. It's still unknown if she got her brown hair back however.
-   Candy from the _Richman_ series has blonde twintails that goes down on her shoulder, and she's one of the nicest characters in the series. For example, in her ending in _Richman 7_, she buys a beautiful island with her money and invites all other contestants, including the snooty ones, there to have a vacation!
-   Spiritia Rosenberg from _RosenkreuzStilette_ has flowing gold hair held in a huge ponytail and is a straightforward, honest, and kind girl whose moral convictions are second to none and who is greatly respected by others, including other soldiers of the Holy Empire. Iris also has gold hair, but unlike Tia, believe it or not, she only pretends to be kind and innocent to disguise her true, evil intentions. Both characters are reincarnations of the legendary Magus Rosenkreuz, after whom the organization of RKS is named; Tia got his soul and his ability to tap into the strength of others', and Iris was blessed with his magical prowess and the abundance of knowledge he had acquired over the course of his life.
-   Wendy from _Rule of Rose_ could have her picture describing this trope; a quiet, sickly little girl with a pretty smile and a blue sundress. Unfortunately, she's also a manipulative Yandere.
-   Kiel from _Rune Factory 4_ is a male example. He's a little Cute Bookworm and Ditzy Genius with Innocent Blue Eyes and a sweet Nice Guy personality to match. His sister Forte also has blond hair and a bit of Chronic Hero Syndrome (she'll accompany the protagonist into dungeons whether she likes them or not, while everyone else in town will only go if they're your friend), but has enough of a tough shell to disqualify her from the straight trope.
-   Heather from _Silent Hill 3_ while is on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge after the death of her father, is still characterised as a compassionate girl and even forgives Douglas after learning he was was working with Claudia the Big Bad. Subverted though Heather aka Cheryl’s true hair colour is actually black same as her Evil Twin Alessa and she only dyed it to hide from The Order. Though she deicides to stay blonde at the end of game symbolising how she’s a different person from Alessa.
-   _Skies of Arcadia: Legends_: Fina is a fair-haired Silvite madien and gentle soul, who's been tasked with gathering the six Moon Crystals and returning with them to the Silver Shrine, so their power to summon the Rains of Destruction can never be used again.
-   Inverted in the _Sly Cooper_ franchise. Penelope is the only major blond character in the series, but she's a sociopath with a fetish for money and power.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_ has Maria Robotnik, the granddaughter of Dr. Gerald Robotnik and cousin of Dr. Eggman. She was the only non-evil member of the Robotnik family and a surrogate sister to Shadow who's only wish was for the people of Earth to be happy; she also qualifies as being Too Good for This Sinful Earth since she's deceased before the start of the series.
    -   Tails has gold fur and is probably the nicest of the big three.
-   _Soul Series_: Sophitia Alexandria is blonde and the epitome of gentleness and purity. She'll even say sorry when she knees you in the stones - gentle and kind as she is, she's a bona-fide Action Girl on a holy mission and she's _not_ going to let you stop her.
-   _Super Mario Bros._: Princess Peach is constantly described as having the purest heart. In terms of coloring, however, she doesn't always fit the trope; her first appearances in the three NES games gave her deep red hair<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and it's only in the more recent incarnations that she's depicted as blonde.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   The first example in the series is Mint from _Tales of Phantasia_. She's 90 pounds of Incorruptible Pure Pureness, a shy White Magician Girl, _and_ completely devoted to healing.
    -   Colette from _Tales of Symphonia_, a foolish Messiah Pollyanna Love Freak.
    -   Princess Natalia from _Tales of the Abyss_. Aside from being a bit of a snob, she's a healer and Politically-Active Princess who only wants what's best for her people.
-   _Three the Hard Way_ has Kanna, whose distinctive blonde hair and incredible beauty has been frequently commented on. And while she occasionally behaves in a suspicious manner, she's very gentle, helpful, polite, and is overall nicer than pretty much everyone else in the party.
-   The _Uncharted_ series has Elena Fisher, an Intrepid Reporter who's the most idealistic person in a cast full of cynics and criminals, and who also happens to be the only blonde. That said, Beware the Nice Ones applies to her: Elena is a Violently Protective Girlfriend/wife who's willing to use lethal force to defend Nate, and in _Uncharted 4: A Thief's End_, she becomes a One-Woman Army when going up against Shoreline, an organization of South African mercenaries threatening to kill Nate and his brother.
-   _Undertale_ plays with this with one character whose actions affected the whole story. Asgore, the King of Monsters, has hair and a beard that are a golden yellow and he is the sweetest person anyone could ever meet. When his children were killed by humans, he was filled with raged and stated that he'd have any human that fell into their world be killed so he could harvest their souls to gain power and break the barrier keeping his people imprisoned, thus they can get revenge. Asgore eventually calms down and realizes he doesn't have the heart to do the deed because he doesn't want to kill anyone, yet not going through with the plan would put his people in deep despair, so he has other people do the killing so he doesn't have to. In the end, he never wanted to kill anyone because he was too kindhearted to do so, but the circumstance he put himself in left him with no choice. In the Golden Ending, which is the only ending that he is alive in, he vows to redeem himself and make up for what he did.
-   Jaina Proudmoore in _Warcraft_ is a blondie with a heart of gold, as she continued to be one of the promoters of peace between The Alliance and The Horde. Until she broke due to the destruction of Theramore, in which her hair got bleached into 90% white and then she lost her peaceful attitude and becomes a warmonger out of grief. When she appears at _Heroes of the Storm_, they picked the time before that destruction and bleaching happened, and she's still 100% this trope.
-   _Valkyria Chronicles_: Squad 7's medic, a young woman who dashes onto the battlefield to bring wounded soldiers to safety. The personnel tab says she's well-liked for her "gentle touch and selfless determination".
-   _The Wonderful 101_: The team's leader, Wonder Red, fits the The Hero archetype to a T. He cares heavily about his team, even when they insult or demean him and his first order of business when the GEATHJERK invade is to make sure all of his students get to safety.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles_:
    -   Shulk and Fiora from the first game. Shulk is The Hero and is a level-headed Nice Guy who proves himself to be the Messiah, while Fiora is a Plucky Girl who cares deeply about her friends to the point of sacrificing herself very early on in the game's story, only to be resurrected as a Mechon later on.
    -   Mythra from _Xenoblade Chronicles 2_ plays with this trope. Her visual design is clearly meant to evoke this trope, with her appearing very angelic, but she's something of an antisocial tsundere whose abrasive and snarky attitude turn others away and make it hard for her to get along with people. This is especially prevalent when comparing her to her other half Pyra, who is a very sweet and kind Nice Girl (and who also defies archetypes by being a redhead with fire-based powers but not a Fiery Redhead). However, Mythra gets better by bonding with people twice throughout her lifetime, and in keeping with both this trope and most tsundere archetypes, is caring and kind behind her harsh facade.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   Regina Berry is so sweet and innocent that she actually doesn't understand the concept of death or the consequences of her naive but dangerous actions.
    -   Colias Palaeno in _Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth_ has a near-constant smile and is ridiculously friendly to everyone he meets. This is why Manny Coachen is able to manipulate him so easily.
-   _Danganronpa_
    -   Sonia Nevermind is one of the kindest students in the series and is willing to befriend just about everyone in the cast, even her Stalker with a Crush Kazuichi (although she _does_ wish he would tone it down and she does run out of patience with him sometimes). She even attempts to defend two other students who are convicted of murder simply because they were her friends.
    -   Kaede Akamatsu has blond hair and is kind to fault, even becoming friends with Shuichi simply because she can tell he has low self esteem. When Monokuma shows up to start the Killing Game, she is adamant that no one will kill anyone else. She seems to subvert this when she's revealed to have killed Rantaro, but she was actually attempting to kill The Mastermind of the game in hopes of stopping it before it could begin. And then it turns out she was framed, meaning she didn't even kill anyone.
-   _Fate/stay night_: Averted with Gilgamesh who is only "Pure" in the sense that he has zero inhibitions.
    -   Played straight with Saber, the heroic knight and selfless king.
    -   Averted with Illya, assuming you accept the Word of God that says her hair is platinum blonde, not white.
-   _The Letter_ has Hannah Wright, a blond and beautiful woman who is nice to pretty much everyone (at least initially). Averted with Lady Charlotte, who, while also blond and beautiful, was a horrible person and whose actions were the very reason the mansion became haunted in the first place.
-   _Little Busters!_: Komari has short blonde hair with side twintails and is extremely innocent, cheerful, and childlike. she is innocent mainly because her brother invoked this trope. He tried to shield her from anything painful, meaning that she cannot encounter things like death without breaking down entirely. She also has a bit of Dumb Blonde to her, too.
-   Laefe Frega from _Tyrion Cuthbert: Attorney of the Arcane_ is one of the nicest and truly good people in the game, and she has bright blonde hair. Compare with her blue-haired sisters who have qualities that bring them down in terms of likability and/or morality.
-   In _War: 13th Day_, Arsenik is both a Princely Young Man and a well-meaning gentleman, who definitely has the look down pat.

    Web Animation 

-   _Happy Tree Friends_ has a bunny called Cuddles; he has bright yellow fur and is very kind and sweet, always wanting to help his friends and hang out with them.
-   _Red vs. Blue_ has platinum-haired Freelancer Agent North Dakota, who's the closest thing the Crapsack World of _RvB_ has to a 100% genuine hero. He's such a kindly and nurturing Team Mom that he even gets given the most childlike of the project's A.I.s, which he acts like a proud parent towards. All of this is a deliberate contrast to his twin sister, who turns out to be an evil blonde with Chronic Backstabbing Disorder that leaves him and other Freelancers to die in various circumstances.
-   Subverted by Yang Xiao Long in _RWBY_. She's actually a tough-as-nails Good Bad Action Girl, or at least as close as you can get in a PG-13 show. In her introduction trailer she plays the part of an innocent underage blonde girl wandering into a Bad Guy Bar, and then interrogates a mob boss by clenching his crotch and then beating the hell out of him and all his goons on her own. However there is no question she is firmly on the side of good.
-   _DSBT InsaniT_: Autmn has orangish-blonde hair, and there isn't a mean bone in her body.
-   _Hazbin Hotel_ gives us Charlie Magne, the Princess of Hell, who has long gold hair and is the nicest, sweetest character on the series.

    Webcomics 

-   Lizzie and Yuri from _Dead Winter_ are both blonde and are definitely good people. Lizzie is The Hero of the story and while has her moments of being mean, genuinely tries her best to be pacifistic even in the face of hostile humans, gets along well with other survivors and children. Yuri Kashnikov could probably take the cake for the Hitman with a Heart trope, he's a kind Boisterous Husky Russkie whom decided to put the whole Blood Sport he was hired to take part in, on hold to help out local Badass Reverend Phillip save fellow survivors.
-   Rolan and Zalanna of _Ears for Elves_ have this. In the former case, it shows that he's a _high_ elf, as well as being innocent and such. For Zalanna, straight blonde hair symbolises her status and how she embraces it, and provides contrast with the Rebellious Princess Tanna's messy and short(er) brown hair.
-   His rare moments of Superpowered Evil Side Mad Scientist aside, Franken from _Noblesse_ is very kind and patient.
-   In _MK's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde_, Mr. Hyde is a blonde and good unlike most adaptations of Jekyll and Hyde.
-   Elan in _The Order of the Stick_ is apparently extremely attractive, although it's hard to tell from the stick-figure art. He is the sweetest and most innocent major character in the comic.
-   The hero of _The Noordegraaf Files_, Theo, is a seventeen year old Wide-Eyed Idealist with bright blonde hair. He's stated to be a really Nice Guy but overly trusting and naive.
-   In _Thistil Mistil Kistil_, while she is a trifle uncanny, Sigyn is still a gentle and generous woman.
-   _Magick Chicks_: Skye is a shy young animal telepath, who was formerly so pure of heart that Hecate was astonished to find her soul was utterly devoid of any malice. Which changed when she willingly tainted her soul in order to save Cerise's life — despite having been manipulated by her.
-   Varden of _Inverloch_ is secretly this (he dyes his hair so it doesn't show up in the dark). Although he starts off making a big deal about how he's only with them for his own convenience, he quickly comes to care about the group as friends, goes out of his way to save Acheron from a fighting ring, encourages Lei'ella to stand up to the Fantastic Racism, and can get very sentimental. Notably, his transition into this comes _with_ the reveal that his hair is really blond.
-   Alice of _Alice and the Nightmare_ has blonde hair and is the sweetest, nicest person in the entire comic, being kind to people and refusing to participate in Fantastic Racism upon hearing about it for the first time.
-   Hannelore in _Questionable Content_ is the kindest soul in the strip, and despite her weird OCD, maybe the emotionally healthiest main character after Marten. She even forgives an obsessive stalker because his story breaks her heart.
-   _Sandra on the Rocks_ demonstrates the trope by its loss. When she first appears, Marie, a natural blonde, is a cheerful, likable girl; after her Face–Heel Turn, she apparently dyes her hair black.
-   _My Deepest Secret_: The main character, Emma has blonde hair and is incredibly kind and helpful to those around her.
-   Subverted in _Rebirth_. There's Parish, Noah's wife, who's revealed to be a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing who had an affair with Ian, resulting in Neo and who doesn't care about Noah. It's implied in regards to Abel, who has made less than kind remarks about Neo and also betrayed Noah alongside Parish in the other timeline, but is also really young and it's uncertain how much of his choices are influenced by others.
-   _Princess Princess_: Sadie is blonde and has the kindly personality to match.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Sarah is blonde, and she's willing to help whenever she can, deeply loyal to her friends, and empathetic enough to offer even an unstable, potentially dangerous Immortal comfort and encouragement.

    Web Original 

-   Janine from _Animerica_ symbolizes this in the purest form imaginable, making her a direct contrast not just to her Love Interest, but to the black-haired Lita and the red-headed Malin. In fact, just about every blonde (except for Takuya and Shirogane) in the series symbolizes this.
-   Apollo, Artemis, Aglaea, and Eros in _Thalia's Musings_. Apollo, though hardly a Chaste Hero, is one of the more moral gods in the Pantheon and renowned as a champion of moderate living. His twin sister, Artemis, is a sworn virgin. Both have healing powers, as does Aglaea, Apollo's granddaughter, who is a dedicated physician. Eros can make life difficult for his "victims", but he ultimately just wants everyone to find true love, something his parents never had.
-   Mega-Girl of the Whateley Universe. Not only is she a beautiful Exemplar with flight and super strength, but she's extremely feminine and bubbly. She's also a virgin (she's only a high school sophomore) mainly because she doesn't have a vagina yet.
-   Malachy in _Moonflowers_—he's polite and friendly, is taking care of his little brother due to their parents' deaths, and he makes friends easily with the female lead Alima. He's also Christian, making him a member of the Saintly Church. This contrasts with his friend Owen, a Tall, Dark, and Snarky pagan who's extremely bitter from nearly getting killed by a homophobic mob. Brighid Brennan is another friend, who's also very friendly and works as both a veterinary and a human nurse. Later on, Persephone appears and is very firmly this as well.
-   Diane, Duchess Tremontaine from _Tremontaine_ exploits this trope to her advantage; she plays the role of a gentle, innocent Proper Lady eventually forced into power by her husband's tragic madness, but she's actually a Magnificent Bastard who also uses her beauty and sexuality to her advantage more discreetly, drove her husband insane by poisoning him with hallucinogens, and is actually an impostor who pulled a Kill and Replace on the real Diane years ago.

    Western Animation 

-   _Adventure Time_: Underneath his hat, Finn has a glorious head of long, beautiful, shimmering golden hair. Bilingual Bonus as "finn" means "fair-haired".
-   Courtney Gripling from _As Told by Ginger_ counts as this, despite being the most popular girl in school, and despite being shallow, ditzy, and attention-hogging, which are more due to her rich, sheltered upbringing. Courtney feels real sympathy for people in less-than-enviable situations and is genuinely interested in the world outside her own, one of the reasons she befriended Ginger in the first place, and over the course of the series, becomes more and more of a friend to her. She's even proven on several occasions to be a better friend to Ginger than Dodie is.
-   Mary Grayson is blonde and beautiful with a heart of gold in The Batman. She dies because she's murdered by Tony Zucco.
-   _Beverly Hills Teens_ has Larke who is the nicest character of the group.
-   _Castlevania (2017)_:
    -   Lisa is exemplar of this, her mission in life is to help and heal people to point where she’s willingly to learn science from Dracula whom falls in love with Lisa and marries her and even walks the world as a man at her request while she works as a doctor. However since this a Dark Fantasy Crapsack World Lisa is burned as a witch by the Corrupt Church for her studies and Dracula as result goes on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge believing Lisa was Too Good for This Sinful Earth, well he’s not wrong.
    -   Alucard takes after his mother being a compassionate individual and seeks peace. Though he did want vengeance for his mother, he wanted those specifically responsible to be punished rather than the Destroy All Humans desire of his father.
-   _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_: Gadget is one of the nicest members of the cast and is a member of the team for a reason: she will never leave anyone in need.
-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_ gives us Numbuh 362/Rachel. While not that big of a character during the beginning of the show, from the third season on, she becomes the overarcing Big Good and is loyal to the organization she leads and serves.
-   Patty Putty is depicted this way in the _Garbage Pail Kids Cartoon_. She has blonde hair as she does on her trading card and is also a very sweet girl.
-   _Hey Arnold!_: The lead character is blond and he's easily the nicest, most understanding person in the entire series and will go out of his way to help those who need it, and rarely has a bad thought about anyone.
-   _The Incredible Hulk (1996)_: Betty Ross is usually a brunette but has blonde hair in this show. She is still as kind as she is usually portrayed as.
-   _Jimmy Two-Shoes_: Jimmy's blond hair is so pure and innocent (just like him), that it even induces niceness upon Lucius Heinous VII (who is an Expy of Satan) when he takes it for himself in "A Hair-Brained Idea".
-   Leni Loud, the second oldest sister of _The Loud House_ is the sweetest and nicest of the kids, and is a platinum blonde. She is also The Ditz, which is more likely due to her good nature rather than her being a traditional Dumb Blonde, as she exhibits considerable Hidden Depths (being a skilled singer, lockpicker and carpenter) and is self-aware enough that she knows how much of an airhead she is.
-   _Miraculous Ladybug_:
    -   Adrien Agreste, despite making a bad first impression, quickly proves himself a genuine Nice Guy and manages to win over his new classmates. As Chat Noir, he's a jovial Pungeon Master and All-Loving Hero (despite the occasional slip-up) who is willing to put his life on the line for the citizens of Paris.
    -   Rose Lavillant pairs this trope with Innocent Blue Eyes, just to further accentuate how much of a Wide-Eyed Idealist she is.
    -   While the third blond(e) in Miss Bustier's class, Chloé Bourgeois, is emphatically _not_ this, her half-sister Zoé is a genuinely sweet girl who sincerely cares about Chloé, even if the latter doesn't reciprocate.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Applejack, a hardworking, honest, and dependable Cool Big Sis and Lovable Jock who is one of the friendlier and more well-meaning ponies on the show, making her a case of Mane of Gold, Heart of Gold.
-   Bubbles of _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_. Friend to creatures great and small.
-   _Ready Jet Go!_: Dr. Bergs is the only prominent blonde in the cast and he stands out by being one of the sweetest and most understanding characters in Boxwood Terrace, as well as being naive and bumbling.
-   In the _Regal Academy_ episode "Astoria and the Beanstalk," Astoria uses this trope to prove to the others that the giant is actually good, since he has long, blonde hair that he takes very good care of.
-   _South Park_
    -   Butters definitely qualifies for this. He's by far one of the most innocent characters on the show.
    -   Kenny (who was shown to be blond in The Movie) is a ambivalent example. Despite his perverted sense of humor, heavily swearing, drug use and being a sexually precocious 10 year old, he is also depicted as heroic (especially in his Mysterion persona),very empathetic when it comes to his friends and sister and smart. Many of his deaths have been acts of heroic self-sacrifice (like in The Movie when he wishes for everything to be back to normal despite knowing he'll go to hell in the process). He also parodies this trope as "Princess Kenny" by using a long blonde female wig (badly) to dress up as a typical example of this trope (especially Princess Zelda), but turns out to be a _villain_ in this persona in _South Park: The Stick of Truth_.

-   Mikey and Gus from _Recess_, who are considerably the most innocent and pure among the main six.
-   _Total Drama_:
    -   Granola Girl Bridgette is easily one of the sweetest and most kindhearted characters on the show.
    -   Lindsay also qualifies. Although she's the epitome of Dumb Blonde (but not a natural blonde apparently), she's one of the friendliest contestants.
    -   Geoff, Bridgette's boyfriend, and quite possibly THE Nice Guy of the show. Owen too; he's probably second to Geoff in terms of friendliness towards all the other contestants.
    -   Dawn, despite her Creepy Child tendencies, was among the kindest and gentlest of the second generation competitors.
    -   Dakota, who underneath her rich, spoiled girl appearance, is shown to be a nice and caring person.
    -   Samey counts too, in contrast to her Evil Twin sister Amy.
    -   Wayne, who is not very bright outside hockey, but is one of the nicest people in the series, as shown by how supportive he is of people, especially his buddy Raj.
    -   Julia introduces herself as a sweet Granola Girl social media influencer who wants to share her "positive energy" with others. This turns out to be a fake persona she puts on to gain followers, and her real personality is that of a spiteful girl who has no problem intimidating and belittling others to achieve her goals. She ends up dropping the act after MK exposes her true colors to everyone and she realizes that she enjoys being herself, especially when this gains her many new followers who are implied to love her true side.
-   _Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race_ ran on this trope: Owen, Rock, Carrie and Geoff were some of the sweetest and kindest contestants competing and even Junior, though a bit more reserved, was a very mature and genuine person. Really the only exception was Jacques and even he was the less evil half of the show's Big Bad pair.
-   _Total DramaRama_: Even as little kids, Bridgette and Owen qualify once again. Bridgette is even more friendly and considerate than her teenage self in this spinoff, while Owen remains every bit as affable and cheerful as he was in the parent show.
