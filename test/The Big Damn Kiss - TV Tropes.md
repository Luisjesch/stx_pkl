_"Since the invention of the kiss there have been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most pure. This one left them all behind."_

A kiss that is Serious Business, with all the spectacle that entails. In all probability it's a First Kiss that finally puts an end to Unresolved Sexual Tension and/or other typical obstacles that get in the way of True Love. The scenery will be epic, the camera will go wild, the music will swell, maybe there'll be some fireworks. The most straightforward way to telegraph a Relationship Upgrade or a Happily Ever After ending which isn't an actual wedding.

Some tropes, such as Smooch of Victory, Hollywood Kiss, Concert Kiss, Beach Kiss, and Lip-Lock Sun-Block, are almost always examples of this as well. If a kiss is built up to be this but fails miserably, it's probably an Awkward Kiss.

**Beware of spoilers.**

Usually has nothing to do with Big Damn Heroes. However, if the heroes do a Smooch of Victory, then it does qualify.

This is the one panel at which the dream of every female reader of FABLES has come true. Each and every one of them must be made to cry or squeal or swoon like a character in a Jane Austen novel. Don't blow it, Buckingham. We sort of, kind of know where you live."

-   _Chronicles of the Kencyrath_: Jame and Tori, in Mother Ragga's lodge, during a volcanic explosion. But while the trope itself isn't subverted, some of its expectations are. It does **not** resolve the Unresolved Sexual Tension; they have an _epic_ kiss… then Tori freaks out and runs away.

As a desperate last-ditch effort to survive, the Doctor tells Charlotte to mash her mouth against his so they can melt into each other's faces and become a single organism together.

    Theatre 

-   In _Bye Bye Birdie_, to grab one last bit of publicity out of Conrad Birdie before he is inducted into the Army, he is to give "One Last Kiss" to one girl "chosen at random from 1,200,000 hysterical teen-agers." Unfortunately, what the television cameras capture is not Conrad Birdie planting a kiss on Kim MacAfee of Sweet Apple, Ohio but Kim's boyfriend Hugo flooring Conrad with one blow.
-   _The Phantom of the Opera_ combines this with a Tear Jerker Bittersweet Ending beautifully.
-   "Champagne" from _In the Heights_ has one at the end, complete with swelling music.
-   In _City of Angels_, Stone and Alaura shared a big passionate kiss as her theme music swells.
-   The _Mrs. Hawking_ play series: In part four, _Gilded Cages_, subverted by the First Kiss between Victoria and Reginald. It has all the trappings of one, but it's all wrong as Victoria has no romantic feelings for him.
-   In _Elisabeth_, Death claims his victims with a kiss.

    Video Games 

-   _Brütal Legend_ has the awesome moment where Eddie and Ophielia kiss for the first time while the Screaming Wall blares a shockwave of sonic energy, causing hair to billow dramatically.
-   At the end of the _Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy_ version of _Crash Bandicoot_'s 100% ending, Tawna gives Crash one of these (well, attempts to). Considering everything you just went through to get to that point, it's very much well-deserved.
-   In _Dead Rising 3_, Nick and Annie/Katey Greene share one after Red is defeated.
-   BioWare loves this trope in general, as the same thing happens in _Dragon Age II_ as Hawke's having one last conversation with the party members before the Very Definitely Final Dungeon. It's especially poignant if Hawke's Love Interest is either Fenris (due to the Second-Act Breakup they had) or Anders because he's a fugitive terrorist at that point.
-   After 13 chapters of UST in _Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories_, Adell embraces Rozalin in the good ending to calm her "True Overlord Zenon" form. She turns back to normal from Adell's Cooldown Hug, and the following dialogue occurs:
    
    **Rozalin:** _(sob)_ Sh- Shut up... you're an enemy! I can't trust anyone...  
    **Adell:** Stop talking and trust this.  
    _(cue The Big Damn Kiss)_
    
-   In _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ DLC _Trespasser_, Inquisitors who romanced Solas will combine the trope with Intimate Healing and potentially Last Kiss during their final encounter when he stops the Mark from killing her by magically removing her left forearm. Swelling music, spinning camera, gorgeous scenery, glowing effects - the whole nine yards.
-   _Dragon Quest_: Princess Gwaelin shares a passionate kiss with the Hero after he saves her from the dragon.
-   _Final Fantasy X_ had a 2-minute long sequence of this between Tidus and Yuna.
-   At the climax of Season One of _Guild Wars 2's_ Living World, NPC party member Kasmeer Meade kisses Marjory Delaqua passionately on the lips out of relief to find that she's still alive, confirming all former hints of their homosexuality and becoming an official couple.
-   _It Takes Two_: In a game which is essentially magic marriage counseling between the two player characters, this occurs at the end of the final chapter, and is the final catalyst that breaks the spell that turned May and Cody into toys.
-   _Life Is Strange_:
    -   The first _Life Is Strange_ has two potential ones in the finale. Depending on your past choices with him, Max, still drenched from the storm, has the option of kissing Warren before she leaps back in time. At the end of the game, if you choose to sacrifice Chloe to save the town, depending on your Relationship Values with her, Max can grab Chloe and kiss her in front of the tornado. In both cases, Max can just hug them instead if Relationship Values aren't high enough.
    -   _Life Is Strange: Before the Storm_ provides the opportunity for Chloe and Rachel to share a passionate first kiss towards the end of the second episode.
    -   _Life Is Strange: True Colors_ can feature one between Alex and either Steph or Ryan after the Spring Festival. Courtesy of Alex's empathy powers, it causes a joy nova that extends all the way to the surrounding mountains and illuminates the stars above.
-   _Love & Pies_: After returning from the baker's retreat and shooing out his twin brother Sam for deceiving Amelia into thinking it was him, Joe asks Amelia out for their first date since high school 15 years ago. She says yes, and they finally kiss without getting interrupted. Unlike the other cutaways, the scene is partially animated with a flashy fade-in and a pink heart background as they move in for the kiss.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   _Mass Effect_ features this for the final romance scene, if the player pursues that option. Given that an Almost Kiss had happened very recently beforehand, it makes it all the more meaningful.
    -   Executed brilliantly, beautifully, heartwarmingly well at the conclusion of _Lair of the Shadow Broker_ between Shepard and a romanced Liara in _Mass Effect 2_.
    -   Perhaps making up for the Headbutt of Love in the second game, Garrus and female Shepard have two of these in _Mass Effect 3_ if their relationship continues. The first is during their date high atop the Presidium when Shepard agrees to be his girlfriend, and the second is in London before the final battle for Earth. And if Shepard's reaction is any indication, Garrus is one hell of a kisser for a guy who doesn't have lips.
-   _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game_ ends each of the first four levels with one between Scott and Ramona.
-   _Shadow Ops: Red Mercury_ ends with a pretty epic one in the final cutscene. The two leads, having saved Paris from destruction, kiss near the foot of the Eiffel Tower as a prototype nuke explodes _above_ them, while dozens of French civilians cheer them on before the credits roll.
-   The BDK from _Sonic '06_ is proof that this trope isn't always what the fandom wanted. Given that it's between the titular character Sonic the Hedgehog and Elise, she a Human Princess, and he, well a Hedgehog, the bestiality undertones are really, REALLY, hard to ignore, not to mention that he was dead at the time and the kiss was supposed to bring him back from the dead, so you can throw necrophilia into the mix. Even said, the Kiss is played completely straight, with the soaring music and glowing aura during the kiss, that the creators intended this to legitimately be a super romantic moment, yet for the reasons any rational human being could come to, the moment is now one of the most maligned events in the entire _Sonic the Hedgehog_ Canon.
-   _Swooning Over Stans: A Grunkle Dating Simulator_: In Stan’s route, him and the player share one in his car during their final onscreen date.
    -   In the good ending of Ford’s route, he and the player share one as the player is about to leave the Mystery Shack. Much to Mabel’s joy.
-   _Valkyria Chronicles_ has a big one between Welkin and Alicia at the climax of the "Maiden's Shield" chapter, where he stops her from attempting a Heroic Sacrifice against the Marmota by declaring his love and asking her to marry him. Alicia tearfully accepts and they share an emotional first kiss, which includes a 360 degree camera pan and sparkling light from her Valkyria transformation.
-   Mostly subverted in _Zelda II: The Adventure of Link_. After Link awakens the princess at the end of the game, a curtain falls over Link and Zelda as they are standing face-to-face, and you only see their feet come together.

    Visual Novels 

-   An omnipresent trope in the Renai genre. Kissing scenes are always one of the few that get their own unique CG art, while the rest of the story uses character sprites.
-   _Little Busters!_: One of the last CGs in Mio's route shows them kissing dramatically in front of a truly beautiful sky.
-   Miyako Miyamura and Hiro Hirono get one in _ef - a fairy tale of the two._.
-   _Katawa Shoujo_ has one for every route, but out of all of them, Emi's is very striking.
-   _Kira☆Kira_ has one for each of the three heroines, but special mention goes to Kirari's since it's also a Concert Kiss. At the end of their last concert on their summer tour, Kirari kisses Shikanosuke, (who is in drag at the time), on stage in front of blinding lights, cameras, and an audience of thousands of people. It also happened to be Kirari's first kiss, although it wasn't Shikanosuke's first.
-   The kiss at the music-themed party in _Melody_. By this time, the protagonist and title character are finally acknowledging their feelings for one another, and the protagonist has just chased Steve away when he’d been harassing Melody. In the moment that comes up for the kiss, the game itself lampshades what’s about to happen:
    
    **Text box:** Kiss her, you fool!!!
    
-   _Shall We Date?: Ninja Shadow_ also has some for (almost) every route. The one between the Player Character and Okita is nice enough to be featured as the very last CG of his Sweet Ending.

When their friends see it, Jaune comments everyone's waited forever for that to happen.

Their kiss itself was actually very passionate. We see Ivy saunter up to a flytrap ensnared Batman before gently laying a hand on his face all while she gazes seductively into his eyes for a moment before shutting hers, puckering up, snaking her other hand around his neck and pulling the squirming Dark Knight in for a deep, smoldering kiss Ivy deepens halfway through, moaning as she does. Ivy then releases Bats with a great, big "mwah", pulling back to give him a sly grin. The ominous music swelling up to the contrasting lush harp cords we hear when their lips come together emphasizes the romantic vibe the moment carries. As is them both being framed like a couple about to recite wedding vows.
