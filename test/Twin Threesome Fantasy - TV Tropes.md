_"Double your pleasure, double your fun!"_

— Long-running Doublemint gum campaign

Bob is attracted to Alice. By some process similar to Oven Logic, he imagines that two Alices must be twice as sexy as one. Sometimes Bob is just fantasizing, but often there's an actual second "Alice" floating around. This may be a genetic twin, a product of Applied Phlebotinum, or more rarely a sibling, parent, cousin, or even just someone unrelated who dresses and acts like Alice.

For whatever reason, a fetish for twins is regarded as G-rated, so characters — especially male ones interested in female twins—can admit to it and not be teased, except for being a general horndog. A woman fantasizing about two attractive male twins however...well, you know.

A less remarked-upon bonus of hooking up with twins is that they make for a wonderfully symmetrical A Lady on Each Arm.

For the record, most real-life twins are as disgusted at the idea of a shared sexual encounter as any other set of siblings, so suggesting a threesome will probably not end well for you. Still, this is by no means limited to porn movies. There certainly are publicly known instances of relationships like these, sometimes initiated by the twins' own volition. And note that while twin threesomes in fiction usually veer toward twincest, the twins can just be interested in the third party, not each other.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Compare traditional Twincest (just the twins, no third party) and Screw Yourself (with **your** Doppelgänger, not someone else's). If the twins _aren't_ ok with sharing, you're looking at a Sibling Triangle. Girl on Girl Is Hot is often behind this, and occasionally Guy on Guy Is Hot. Occasionally, the object of lust can invoke this if they have a Doppelgänger Attack\-like ability. Subtrope of Three-Way Sex.

    Advertising 

-   In this commercial, a group of men get excited at the thought of having Swedish twins come over. The result is not quite what they expected. The ad is for the National Hockey League, and the twins in question are Vancouver Canucks forwards Henrik and Daniel Sedin.
-   Doublemint Gum has been advertised by numerous generations of beautiful female twins using the slogan "Double Your Pleasure, Double Your Fun".

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Black Lagoon_, Hansel and Gretel make this trope a thing of nightmares. Too bad no-one warned poor Garcia Lovelace. In a omake at the end of vol. 3, they play doctor with him, and if he wasn't traumatized enough, they then play _actual_ doctor with him, reducing the poor kid to bedwetting at night again. Roberta is not pleased.
-   In _Date A Live_, the twins Kaguya and Yuzuru Yamai fought each other at first for Shido's affections, but then agreed they don't mind sharing him with each other. They do, however, mind sharing him with any of the other Spirits.
-   The yuri manga _Docchi ni Shiro Dotsubo_ revolves around this. The protagonist Yukino, a school teacher, hooks up with a teenager over a dating app because she reminds her of a student she's smitten with, only to find out that the two are in fact twin sisters. This leads to a threesome betweem them, although from that point on the twins, Runa and Hina, fight over her. By the end, the twins patch up their differences and agree share Yukino, who gladly divorces her husband to start a three-way relationship with them.
-   Mairu and Kururi Orihara from _Durarara!!_ invoke this trope. They have no objections to hooking up with the same guy (or girl) and don't see each other as separate people.
-   In _Full Metal Panic!_, the Creepy Twins Xia Yu Fan and Xia Yu Lan in relation to Gauron.
-   _Futakoi_ is a Themed Harem show with six separate sets of twins. It literally _exists_ because of this trope.
    -   _Futakoi Alternative_, a successor show with the same girls, but focusing on different characters, and a very different mood, actually played the hero and twin heroines in a more traditional Love Triangle romance. It helps that they shifted the focus onto the one set of twins that were Polar Opposite Twins.
-   _Irresponsible Captain Tylor_ has female twins Emi and Yumi Hanner as part of the bridge crew. They simultaneously proposition Tylor for sex. Unfortunately for him, they apparently pick the one time that he's too distracted to say "HELLS YEAH!" and interpret it as a rejection—so they just latched onto the gynophobic fighter pilot Koujiro instead, the poor bastard. Since Tylor is perhaps the hardest to read character in anime history, he may have rejected them quite deliberately. A later comment implies that he really was paying attention to what they were saying. After all, the girls did take it pretty well, realising that they shouldn't rush to give themselves until they find the one person who's right for them.
-   In _Otome Youkai Zakuro_, Ganryu is in a canonical OT3 with twin sisters Bonbori and Hozuki.
-   The Hitachiin twins admit to playing this up to get clients in _Ouran High School Host Club_. Among other things...
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   James could have a Twin Threesome Nightmare, considering his partner/best friend Jessie and the ex-fiancé he's been running from for years (stated as the reason he ran away from home in the first place), Jessiebelle, are nearly identical. You'd think he would've run from Jessie the first time he saw her; it's implied that James either doesn't see it or it's his subconscious reason for being with Jessie in the first place (since he originally had a crush on Jessiebelle).
    -   Brock has probably had many a fantasy about having an orgy with the hundreds of Nurse Joys and Officer Jennies out there... which is now an Ascended Meme thanks to this episode.
-   In _Ranma ½_, after Ranma has accidentally created a clone of his female half, Kunō comes across _two_ Pigtailed Girls, hugs them, and says "It's like holding roses with both arms!" before being pummeled. Disappointingly (as the concept of Kunō chasing two girl-Ranmas would have fueled endless comedy), this is treated as a single-panel joke.
-   In _Red River (1995)_, Kikurri ends up marrying twin sisters Ryui and Shala, after it is revealed that they have the same taste in men and as a result have been taking turns to go see him... and he has gotten both of them pregnant. And they _both_ give birth to twins!
-   _Sekirei_: Kaoru Seo's two Sekirei, Hibiki and Hikari, are identical twins (only told apart by their bust sizes), and at one point he states that he was late because they "kept him up all night". The twins' reaction imply he wasn't making it up, and the manga's epilogue confirms it by revealing that his four children were born all _on the same day_.
-   In _Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman_, this is the main motivation for The Lancer: "I can't die yet! I have a date with _Turkish twins!!_"
-   In _Strawberry 100%_, Junpei, after discovered that Aya (his Meganekko schoolmates) is the mysterious girl with the strawberry panties, imagine to hug and grope both the nerdy-Aya and normal-Aya despite them being the same person.
-   Once in _To Love Ru Darkness_, Momo tease Rito about the possibility of having a bath with both Yami and Tearju.
-   In _Utawarerumono_, there's Oboro and the twins, Dori and Gura.<small>◊</small> Be warned though, they're all guys.
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: When Matsuri is split into a boy and girl, Suzu _immediately_ imagines them both naked and fighting over her.
    
    **Suzu**: Wow, wow, wow! I'm in trouble...  
    **Shirogane**: No, you _are_ trouble.
    

    Comic Books 

-   In _The Authority_, The Engineer duplicates herself with her nanomachines for some fun with Jack Hawksmoor.
-   Subverted in _Watchmen_: Laurie wakes up to find Doctor Manhattan has duplicated himself in order to "please her" but ends up freaking out. And she gets _really_ mad when she discovers that a fourth Doctor Manhattan had been working in the lab all that time. The moral of the story is: always check whether your partner will accept something before you attempt it.
-   _XXXenophile_:
    -   Happens in the story "Family Reunion", with clones instead of twins.
    -   Another has the classic version, with the twins having some fun with the Monster Under The Bed.
-   _Legion of Super-Heroes_: Not once brought up in all of Bouncing Boy's long marriage to Duo Damsel, though he did look inordinately happy when she'd kiss him from both sides at once.
-   It _was_ brought up with Jamie Madrox (Multiple Man) a mutant hero who can make far more than two clones of himself. Siryn/Banshee (Theresa Cassidy) of X-Force/X-Corporation/X-Factor (2006) has always had a crush on him, and when they were working together in Paris, she was shown to be really interested in the potential, even asking their teammate M (Monet St. Croix) something along the lines of "Come on, are you telling me you never thought about it?". Of course, snobbish as she is, Monet didn't want to continue the conversation. Later on, when the three of them were part of X-Factor Investigations in _X-Factor (2006)_, it turned out that: A) Monet _was_ actually interested; B) Jamie actually _did_ use his powers to improve his sex life, but in a different and more obvious way, by sleeping with both girls during the same night. Later, after Jamie Madrox married Layla Miller, it was confirmed in at least one issue that this Trope was played straight.
-   Subverted in _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_ with the backstory for the minor characters Lyco and Leeta Wolf. An unnamed guy tries two-timing them with this trope in mind, but the siblings finds out and dump him on a spot. Even when they meet the guy again, now as a Mook, they are still upset at him.
-   In an ultra-incestuous twist, Orion Assante in _Grendel_ enters the story in an incestuous three-way relationship with his two sisters, who are twins.
-   In _Lori Lovecraft: Into the Past_, Raoul Reichmann blows off an evening with Danke to go off with a pair of identical twins instead. Danke's response is a snarky:
    
    Well, it always did take two of them to compete with one of me.
    
-   Parodied in _Alan Ford_: in one issue corrupt and childish business man Sem Brandelli picks three beautiful girls at his party for seemingly an orgy to show how much of a man he is... but as soon as they're alone, he makes the three girls exercise with some gym tools while moaning in pleasure to fool listeners, so that he appears to be fine and rested while the three girls are pooped and sweaty. One of them even compliments him for such clever ruse.

    Fan Works

-   The inner monologue in the _Gantz Abridged_ episode 08 & 09 has these thoughts about Ms. Fanservice and her unwitting double.
-   An _Order of the Stick_ fanfic explained Vaarsuvius' gender ambiguity away by having V turn out to be Half-Identical Twins who make sure they're never both in view of the rest of the Order at once. Haley found out. And then they have a threesome.
-   With increasing regularity, the Channel Awesome Kink Meme has characters (usually Insano or The Nostalgia Chick) getting off on having sex with Critic and Ask That Guy at the same time. While they're not canon twins, it still counts because of the heavy fanon.
-   Inverted in the _Pokémon X and Y_ fanfic Pokemon X and Y: Dawn of a New Era, where twins Flora and Fauna fantasize about being with Calem—and liking the idea of sharing him.
-   In _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ fanon, the apparent twins America and Canada are often subjected to this with others. And if you really like the FACE (France, America, Canada, England) interaction, well then...
-   _XSGCOM_ references the _Stargate SG-1_ example below, with the addition of an android Carter from an earlier episode.
-   _The Life and Times of a Winning Pony_: Cloud Kicker ends up in one with the Spa Twins, due to Rarity inadvertently setting up a Happy-Ending Massage (which the twins _only_ did because it was her asking).
-   In _Sophistication and Betrayal_, the protagonist has a dream of this involving two copies of his marefriend Rarity, something the real Rarity finds quite amusing.
-   Implied in _Ned Stark Lives_ and inverted: two of Walder Frey's daughters are twins, present themselves to Robb (who has to marry one of Walder Frey's daughters) at the same time, probably trying to evoke this. The inversion comes when they seem crestfallen when Robb tells them that he can only take one of them.

-   _Thinking In Little Green Boxes_: The Weasley Twins sleep with (and accidentally knock up) the Stepford Cuckoos.
-   Features in the Modern AU _How to Train Your Dragon_ fic "Confusion", which adds the OC of Astrid's twin sister, Lillian, who has had an incestuous relationship with Astrid since they were young until she and Astrid independently meet Hiccup and each end up falling for him. It should be noted that Hiccup's relationship with them started because he met each separately and a complex chain of events led to the sisters thinking they were seeing him on his own while Hiccup assumed the two were the same person until he met them at their flat, leading to their decision to pursue a triad once Hiccup confirms he's independently attracted to each of them.
-   The _Kim Possible_ fic "All I Really Want" features Shego arranging for Drakken to create a clone of Kim after Shego reveals that she's in love with the original Kim, Shego hoping that she can basically convince the clone to love her even after the real Kim rejected her.

-   The _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_ fic "A New Timeline" features a second version of Cameron joining the team when she comes back in time from ten days in the future to prevent an assassination attempt that killed John, Sarah and Derek in her timeline. The two Camerons swiftly agree to share John, although the "new" Cameron dyes her hair and adopts the name "Alison" to distinguish between the two. The fic ends with Alison sacrificing her original body to destroy a key facility, but her chip is saved and she is transferred into a new body, preserving her relationship with John and Cameron even though she is no longer Cameron's double.
-   The _Victorious_ fic "Double Trouble" features alternate versions of Jade and Tori being pulled into a world where the "local" Jade and Tori are dating.

    -   Chapter 76 features an interesting example of this; during Katie's bonding with Harry, she arrives to find Harry with a version of herself from one hour in her personal future, the Katies' words suggesting that Katie only does this because she arrives to find herself there already, but she soon decides to enjoy the opportunity.
-   In the Marvel Cinematic Universe fic _Spider-Man: Finding Home_, when Peter Parker tells Kate Bishop and Yelena Belova about the events of _Spider-Man: No Way Home_, although he emphasises that his two counterparts looked different from him, Kate finds herself fantasising about explicit images involving three identical Peters.

-   _Unbreakable Red Silken Thread_: While not actually related, it was mentioned in chapter 26 that Heather and Nikki put on a 'twin act' for Cody, complete with purple bedlah outfits.
-   Discussed (and Gender-Inverted) in this _Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race_ story, after Kitty sleeps (and nothing else) with Jay and Mickey.

    **Chloe**: You were thinking about having two of me around, weren’t you?  
    **Marinette**: Well, that’s not a bad thing is it? Just think, it would be like you, but…symmetrical. Compare and contrast….  
    **Chloe**: You will not be comparing me and contrasting Zoe, do you hear me! Nope! Nada! Not at all! Especially with whatever devious thoughts are going through that head of yours! Only I can think deviously around here, stop it! Especially if they involve me and my half sister!
    
-   Played for Horror in the _Persona 5_ Role Swap AU _Second Chance_, where Kasumi and Sumire Yoshizawa—who aren't twins in canon, but are implied to be such in this AU—are the targets of Kamoshida's desires.

    **Confessor:** I'm telling _everybody!_

-   In _Altered Carbon_, people can switch bodies (sleeves) on a fairly frequent basis.

He's floored afterward when she tells him she has three (highly illegal) copies of herself, complete with pheromones in storage, just waiting for him provided he stops helping his client.

Of course, he chooses to keep the memories of the former body so he does miss out.

The sister, being a little more versed in the subject explains that he's probably imagining what it'd be like to sleep with both of them. The first sister is confused, as Klingon sex is extremely violent, and a threesome would be deadly. Also, she thinks that the man should want to have sex with two women who look different for a little variety. She later attacks him for supposedly having these thoughts.

But if you check the index, you'll learn that the Fowler twins are actually _sisters_. Their names are Jennelyn and Jeyne. So it's Gender Inverted in a different way.
-   _Dilbert_ creator Scott Addams, in _The Dilbert Principle_, points out that the invention of _Star Trek_\-style holographic virtual reality would be the death of the human race. He points out that nobody will be interested in the ego-crushing business of romance and dating when they can program their own fantasy with no risk of rejection or the messier, Squickier complexities of human interaction. As illustration of this, he pointed out that if he can get Cindy Crawford and her identical twin sister in the holodeck any time he wants with no risk of rejection or refusal, he would never come out.
-   _The Way of Kings (2010)_: Referenced in the story Wit makes up to tease Renarin out of his shell.
    
    **Wit:** Have I told you about the night Prince Renarin and I had two days back, walking the streets of the warcamp? We came across these two sisters, you see, blue eyed and—  
    **Renarin:** _\[blushing\]_ That's a lie!  
    **Wit:** Very well, I'll confess there were actually _three_ sisters, but Prince Renarin quite unfairly ended up with two of them, and I didn't wish to diminish my reputation by—  
    **Dalinar:** Wit.

    -   Subverted with Fiyero. His distant wife Sarima has offered more than once to let him sleep with any of her five younger sisters. He's rejected her offers because he knows she just wants to use it as a way to manipulate him more.

    Live-Action TV

-   Surprisingly averted by _Battlestar Galactica_, despite seeming perfectly set up for it. Dr Gaius Baltar has slept with three different versions of Cylon Model Number Six (four if you count Head Six, the angelic messenger that appears to him as a Six), but never at the same time.

        **Anya:** So... you Xanders really do have all the same memories, all the same... _\[looking downward\]_ physical attributes?  
        **Suave Xander:** We're completely identical.  
        **Scruffy Xander:** Yeah, we checked out some stuff in the car on the way over... Fingerprints!  
        **Anya:** Well, maybe we shouldn't do this reintegration thing right away. See, I can take the boys home, and... we can all have sex together, and... you know, just slap 'em back together in the morning.  
        **Suave Xander:** She's joking.  
        **Scruffy Xander:** No she's not! She entirely wants to have sex with us together. Which is... **wrong** , and, and it would be very confusing.
        
        -   Especially since the second Xander was played by Nicholas Brendon's real-life identical twin.
            
            **Anya:** It's not like it'd be cheating. They're both Xander.
            
    -   Buffy also has one episode, "Superstar", where Jonathan becomes the best at absolutely everything. The mark of the sexiest man alive? Having two identical blonde twins to sleep with.
-   _Castle_: The actress playing Nikki Heat in the movie version of Castle's book shows up dressed like Beckett and with her hair dyed to match.
    
    **Castle:** Just like I dreamed... _\[beat\]_ Did I say that out loud?
    
-   In one episode of _Cheers_, Sam claims he did this once, but he doesn't elaborate. (It was a throwaway gag.) He later recruits a pair of beautiful redheaded twins to have sex with Melvin, the landlord of the Cheers bar in order to persuade him to sell the bar to him rather Rebecca.
-   _Doctor Who_ has a few:
    -   In "The Poison Sky", the Doctor confronts Martha's evil clone:
        
        **The Doctor:** You might as well have worn a T-shirt saying "clone"... although, maybe not in front of Captain Jack.
        
    -   "Journey's End":
        
        **Sarah Jane:** So there's three of you?

    -   In "A Good Man Goes to War", River Song reminiscences about a previous birthday she spent with two Doctors at once. Lucky girl...
    -   "The Girl Who Waited": Rory has no issue with being married to both Old Amy and present Amy. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   The "Night and the Doctor" DVD extras show where River may have got the idea. They feature multiple Doctors _and_ Rivers in the TARDIS, but she's the only one to bring up the possibilities (mainly because there's never more than one of her in the same room at once).
        
        **River:** Two of you! The mind races, does it not?
        
-   A client in _Dollhouse_ apparently has a standing order for twins whenever he comes into L.A.

-   Heavily discussed in an episode of _Kaamelott_ where King Arthur's twin mistresses (the "fisherman's twin daughters") ask the king which one is his favorite:
    
    **Arthur:** But anyway, for that matter, you're not especially... skilled... Well, I mean, There's nothing much er... Well, It's um... kinky mainly because there's both of you... Because otherwise, one by one, there's nothing much... I mean, it's nice but still... _\[beat\]_ You can't say that to twin sisters, can you?
    
-   In an episode of _L.A. Law_, Michael Kuzak (Harry Hamlin) related how he had once dated twins: both separately and together. This earned him the envy of his male colleagues.

-   In _Nip/Tuck_, Christian Troy has a threesome with identical twins in the series' second episode.

Garner played one half of a set of twins, along with Rachel Dratch, who was made up to look hideous (including a half-formed baby arm sticking out of her head). The two dressed identically, and went on a date with two men, played by Jimm Fallon and Chris Kattan. Fallon got Jennifer, Kattan got Rachel. Kattan's character eventually walked out in disgust, while Fallon made out with Jennifer. The punchline of the skit? Rachel's character eating a slice of pizza while Jennifer's character made out with Fallon's, and saying, "Make out with her all you want—I'm the one with the vagina." Fallon's reaction? Giving the "O.K." hand signal. ( To top it off, there were implications that the twins were conjoined.)

-   "_Split Personality_", a _Tales from the Crypt_ episode has Vic (played by Joe Pesci) running afoul of two deliciously beautiful and wealthy twins. He can't decide which twin he loves more (and they have an equal say in what happens to their massive fortune, so marrying one only gets him half), so he pretends to be twins himself and marries both, spending a lot of time "traveling on business", going from one twin to the other. They discover the falsehood and end up sharing him. They decide to just split him... literally, down the middle, after they cut him up with a chainsaw, starting with the nether region!
-   Jack from _Will & Grace_ has, as his life's ambition, to one day meet and have sex with a pair of male identical twins. Will once actually invited over a pair of gay identical athletic twins just to make Jack jealous.

    Music

    _I wanna get with you  
    And your sister too  
    I think her name's Debra_
    
-   A line from "Can't Get Enough Of You Baby" by ? & the Mysterians:
    
    _Whenever we kiss  
    I get a feeling like this  
    I get to wishing that there were two of you_
    
-   Also a similar line from The Notorious B.I.G. on "Fucking You Tonight":
    
    _Not the Marriott  
    We'd be lucky if we find a spot  
    Next to your sister  
    damn I really miss the  
    Way she use to rub my back  
    When I hit that  
    Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle_
    
-   Evelyn Evelyn:
    -   Played for scary with Evelyn Evelyn; the fictional band characters are conjoined twins who were pimped out in their childhood and again in later life by the owner of the circus they were sold to.
        
        _I know you like twins—  
        Have I got a surprise!  
        They're identical sisters  
        Attached at the sides!_
        
    -   Less Squicky variation in their song "You Only Want Me 'Cos You Want My Sister" (which isn't about Evelyn Evelyn but a pair of non-conjoined identical twins):
        
        _If you think you're seeing double let me save you some trouble  
        This ain't no two-for-one bargain here, mister  
        'Cos I'm much more than just twice shy, I've had enough two-timing guys  
        Who only want me 'cos they want my sister._
        
-   Tragically and Squickily averted in the Vermillion Lies song "Long Red Hair", which is about conjoined twin sisters connected by their long red hair. One of the sisters marries a man that the other doesn't care for, to the point that she prevents her brother-in-law and sister from consummating their marriage. The man tries to fix this by cutting the twins' hair, but it only results in his wife and sister-in-law bleeding to death from their hair.
-   Not one but two different rap songs mention Tia and Tamera Mowry of _Sister, Sister_ fame in this fashion, both making puns on other shows related to them.
    -   J. Cole's "Cole Summer":
        
        _If I had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamera  
        At the same time, and put name tags on they titties so I don’t get they names wrong  
        Screamin' "Game on"_
        
    -   Childish Gambino's "The Worst Guys"
        
        _Tia and Tamera in my bed  
        I'm a smart guy_
        
-   "The New Style" by Beastie Boys from _Licensed to Ill_
    
    _I've got money and juice—twin sisters in my bed  
    Their father had envy, so I shot him in the head_
    
-   From "Up" by Cardi B: "If that nigga had a twin, I would let 'em run a train!"

-   A non-twin sibling variation pops up in _Hamilton_. In "Helpless", Eliza mentions that her sister, who loves her boyfriend, (jokingly) wants to form a triad:
    
    **Elizabeth:** Laughing at my sister 'cause she wants to form a harem  
    **Angelica:** _\[spoken\]_ I'm just saying' if you really love me you would share him  
    **Elizabeth:** Hah!
    

    Video Games 

-   _Baldurs Gate 3_: In the brothel Sharess's Caress in Act 3, there's a pair of drow fraternal twins (brother and sister) who specialize in servicing clients together. It's possible to not only hire them but to have one of your party members join in as well.
-   In the second _Rune Factory_ game as your child you can "marry" a set of twins. They're blissfully naive though so they most likely didn't think too much into it.
-   Although it never actually goes anywhere, it's pointed out that in _Dragon Quest IV_, the twins Meena and Maya both have the hots for the male hero. Whether or not it would have ended up as a Twin Threesome Fantasy is left out, as romantic options weren't available for the game (Maya probably would go for it, but Meena probably wouldn't). Sadly, all hints of this were purged from the U.S. version when they removed the party talk option.
-   _Dead Rising 2_ has Amber and Crystal Bailey, who fondle one another, fondle other women, and poke fun at Chuck's lackluster "performance".

-   In _God of War_, after defeating the Hydra, Kratos has a threesome with a pair of twins he finds in the boat captain's quarters. The novelization gives their names as Zora and Lora. In the opening scene of _God of War II_, the pair can be seen lying near Kratos' throne as his consorts.
-   In _God of War: Chains of Olympus_, after Kratos defeats the Persian King, he enters a cell to find twin slave girls that the Persian King had apparently claimed for his own. Kratos has a threesome with them.

That being said, Lo Wang wants nothing to do with them in that way — when Hoji asks about this, Lo Wang's response is "I prefer my body parts actually attached to my body, thank you very much."
-   In _Assassin's Creed Origins_, during one mission you're told to go to a brothel and speak with the "legendary twins" who work there, because they have information about the man you're hunting.

The sisters are flustered and creeped out by her offer and refuse.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Visual Novels 

-   _Tsukihime_ pseudo-sequel _Kagetsu Tohya_ features the unlockable side story "Flower of Thanatos", where one of the possible options is to have Shiki have a passionate threesome with maid twin sisters Hisui and Kohaku. Of course, given that he's trapped in an endlessly repeating day with nothing _existing_ outside the mansion grounds, he's started to have regrets...
-   One of the paths in Summer Days features twin sisters and Itou Makoto.
-   Unlocked in _If My Heart Had Wings_ after clearing Asa's route. Though the route gives more focus on the other twin, Yoru, leaving Asa out of the h-scenes until the final one.
-   _Yumina the Ethereal_ has Miko twin sisters Youko and Tsukuyo Sakaue, who you can get an H-scene with if you defeat them after using a certain attack on one of them once.
-   Towards the latter parts of _Nekopara_ Volume 1, the protagonist Kashou eventually ends up in a romantic relationship with his catgirls Vanilla and Chocola, who are non-identical twins.
-   In _Higurashi: When They Cry_, Oishi approaches Keiichi in a library while he was meeting with Shion. As Oishi already knew that Keiichi and Mion were close, he then proceeds to tease Keiichi about "two-timing with the Sonozaki twins" (Keiichi protests this, though Shion simply ignores it). It's even more apparent in the arc where Shion is introduced, though in that case Keiichi doesn't realize she's a different person (he thinks it's Mion, pretending she has a twin—not helped by the fact that at one point she actually _is_, too). Cue traditional _Higurashi_ hijinks and inevitable bloody murder.
-   In _Yearning: A Gay Story_, Ashleigh and Leigh are identical twins who aren't shy about proposing threesomes to men. Adam and Carlos are initially interested in them, but the reality turns out to not live up to the fantasy with the men being too weirded out by having sex with two demanding women they can't distinguish from one another or even get the names of right to find it enjoyable.

    Webcomics

-   In _Homestuck_, Karkat has a brief fantasy involving Jade and Jadesprite.
-   _Schlock Mercenary_ had one husband contemplating the issue when his wife was discovered to have been duplicated at the molecular level by the Ancient Conspiracy, here. Given the number of other people who were likewise duplicated, it has presumably come up several times, from members of both genders.
    -   Given the scope of the duplication, it likely occurred all over in endless permutations. Relatively happy endings probably include the open-minded and those for whom both sides of the couple were duplicated an equal number of times.
-   In _Evil, Inc._, a character discovers that a robot duplicate of her is fully functional, and decides to borrow it for the weekend so her husband can live out "THE Fantasy".
-   In _Least I Could Do_, Rayne's brother Eric gets a very real shot at fulfilling this fantasy when a valentine arc sets him up with twins. However, his blows his chances by first bragging to everyone how he's on a date with twins instead of paying attention to the same twins, then tries to take them to an extremely low-budget hostel. To summarize: he ruins his chances with a sexy pair of twins because he wants to save some money. Yeesh. Worse: it's his brother, a _medical doctor_ who is generally regarded as wealthy. Damn cheapskate...
-   In _Umlaut House_ here Volair uses his wife's time portal to do this in a rare example where the twins involved are male (and knowing Volair it could have also been an instance of Screw Yourself).
-   _Linburger_ has a pair of Gender Bender twins who are the objects of a threesome fantasy of one of the characters.
-   In _Turn Signals on a Land Raider_, here. **"Twins They Were!"**
-   In _Rogues of Clwyd-Rhan_, Kel's husband Jodoque has some interesting fantasies (mildly NSFW) after meeting Kel's two near-identical sisters (unlike her they have fairy wings; long story). Later on he's slightly less enthusiastic when one of the winged sisters gets into bed with him (nudity) and pretends to be Kel. Actually it was a disguised Kel all along (yup, they're still naked)... or was it?! Either way, the sisters planned it as a practical joke when they saw Jodoque's reaction to them.
-   _Ménage à 3_:
    -   Zii not only had this fantasy, but it was real — with a set of triplets.
    -   Dillon's sleazy boss has Dillon dress up as Amber's twin to invoke this, because he doesn't want to make actual twin sisters commit incest.
-   In _Narbonic_, Dave gets awfully interested when Lovelace (an AI, and also his Romantic False Lead) casually mentions that she's able to copy her source code.
    
    **Lovelace:** Don't get your hopes up. There's only one projector.
    
-   _The Order of the Stick_: In one of the book collections, there's a story where the characters encounter versions of themselves from another dimension. The other Haley suggests to her Elan that "sleeping with two versions of your S.O. still counts as monogamy."
-   This is one of Arakune's life goals in _Blazen!_ that appears on his increasingly-large bucket list.
-   _Grrl Power_:
    -   The backstory of minor characters Olivia and Tony is half-sibling/cousins due to their father having slept with twins at "a college party or something." Olivia also implies the relationship is _ongoing_, as "It was like a god damned Sitcom growing up"—especially because their grandmother loves using a homemade Laugh Track.
    -   Main character Harem invokes the trope with her name and power: she can split herself up into up to five non-identical copies and has used it for the obvious Power Perversion Potential.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Nanase seems to have this on her mind (though perhaps not the sex aspect) when she witnesses a tickle fight between Ellen and Elliot (who is genderbent into a form that looks exactly like Ellen).
    -   Ashley likes the idea of having a clone spell so that she can duplicate herself for amorous activities with Elliot.
-   Subverted in _Oglaf_. While trapped in his Lotus-Eater Machine, Ivan's love interest says she's delivered twins and shows him... two miniature copies of herself making out. Rather than be a turn on, it's the sight that makes Ivan briefly realize it's All Just a Dream.
-   _Sluggy Freelance_: When Riff's ex-girlfriend shows up half-naked at his door, he shuts it in her face. Then she shows up with her clone. He still shuts the door, but it takes him longer.
-   _Lackadaisy_: Discussed by Mordecai and Joey when Mordecai comments on a picture of identical twin cabaret girls. Or, rather, discussed by _Joey_ — Mordecai just appreciates symmetry in general.
    
    **Mordecai:** Twins. Symmetrical.  
    **Joey:** Haha, _that's_ what I'm talking about!  
    **Mordecai:** _I_ was speaking—  
    **Joey:** Yeah, you said it!
    
-   Towards the end of Chapter 2 of _Tiger, Tiger_, Jamis has a dream in which he's accosted by multiple versions of Remy and Ludovica, all of them clamouring for his support and attention. It's a pretty straightforward metaphor for how he's torn between his loyalty for his friend/captain and his fiancee, but it suddenly veers into a different sort of subtext towards the end:
    -   Then subverted, where the dream twins make their displeasure with the idea of Brother–Sister Incest clear.

    Web Original 

-   _Gaia Online_'s Liam seduced the Von Helson twins when they were trying to kill him in 2007. If you visit him in his shop, he complains that they _still_ have it bad for him.
    -   In the Dating Sim\-based "Love Charm II" minigame, one of the female options is the Gemini Twins.
-   Painfully subverted in a couple of supposedly true stories circulating the Web for years:
    -   A college student meets a fun punk girl. "Fun" in a chain-smoking-vodka-swilling-loose-cannon way. She seems to have occasional memory lapses, but this isn't the oddest thing about her. Then one day he unexpectedly walks into her dorm room and finds that "she" is actually a pair of bi twins, who love to have sex pretending one of them is him. They invite him to join, but he's so freaked out, he leaves and breaks up with her/them.
    -   Twin sisters married twin brothers. (That's not uncommon.) When one woman is asked if she ever wanted doing it with her sister's husband, she is squicked and compares this to using another person's toothbrush.
-   A prank seems to prove that this fantasy is very common.
-   In _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_, after Cell regains his Perfect form, Krillin asks Gohan to kick him in the stomach again to see if he'll cough up another Android 18. He claims he's "asking for a friend."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Western Animation 

-   _Archer_: Archer mentions that he not only had a threesome with twin girls, but that they were both actual princesses! It's actually an oddly touching reference, as he states that such situations were the only times he ever cheated on Lana. He's of course a pig, but that's pretty much the most impressive complement he's ever given Lana; that she's as amazing as a ludicrous fantasy.
-   Played with in a _Danny Phantom_ episode where Tucker dreamed himself with two duplicates of a female character named Star (who in "real life" has no twin).
-   In _Daria_, Brittany thinks Kevin is going with both Daria and Quinn. His response: "Whoa! Twins!" (FYI: Daria and Quinn are blatantly not twins, Kevin is just very stupid.)
-   In _Dr Zitbags Transylvania Petshop_, Dr. Zitbag has a mutual attraction with his neighbors, the Exorsisters.
-   _Duckman_:
    -   An episode episode has blond twin bombshells hire Duckman and Cornfed to "help" with their love lives. Nothing comes of it, because Duckman can't get over his guilt towards his dead wife, and Cornfed has some sort of off-screen breakdown long before they get near a bed.
    -   In Season 4, it's revealed that Bernice and the late Beatrice actually had another identical sister named Beverly. When it's all out in the open, Duckman immediately suggests this and is just as quickly ignored by Bernice and Beverly.
-   _Family Guy_: when Peter thinks he's Larry from _Three's Company_, he bursts in the door saying "Jack! Twins! Swedish! My place! Now!"
-   _Johnny Test_'s sisters Mary and Susan keep trying to get Gil to "fall in love with _them_". Note the operative word. A unique use of the trope indeed.
-   _Miraculous Ladybug_: In the episode "Timebreaker", some Time-Travel shenanigans cause two Ladybugs to appear at once. Cat Noir, who has a crush on Ladybug, declares that "I'm in heaven!"
-   _Rick and Morty_ In "Bethic Twinstinct", Earth Beth and Space Beth start an affair behind Jerry's back. When he finds out and later confronts them about it at the end of the episode, he tells them that his biggest issue was really just them keeping it a secret from him (which Earth Beth admits was wrong) and he's okay with it if it makes her happy, which quickly leads to the Beths getting it on right in front of him while he encourages it. This ends up being a big turn-on for all three of them, and while the audience (and Rick, Summer and Morty) can only hear and not see what happens next, it's heavily implied to turn into a threesome soon after, with Jerry getting to bang both clones of his wife.
-   _Sonic Boom_: In "Mech Suits Me", while under the influence of a symbiotic suit that turns him increasingly evil, Sonic hits on the twins Staci and Perci right in front of Amy Rose. When freed from the suit, Sonic claims to not remember anything, but screws it up by fondly commenting on how hot Staci and Perci were, pissing Amy off.
-   In an episode of _Stroker and Hoop_, this situation comes up with a pair of hot blonde twins. However, it turns out they are members of the "Kind Cannibal Cult" which harvests the vestigial organs from people so they can eat them.
-   _Tangled: The Series_: "The Return of Strongbow" heavily implies that Flynn Rider once had an "encounter" with a warlord's twin daughters.
-   Hank Venture lusts after both Nancy and Drew Quymn in _The Venture Brothers_, but they both only have eyes for Dean (who in a subversion of the trope is interested in neither).
-   Hekapoo from _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_ has had literally _hundreds of clones_ and seeing how much Ship Tease she's had with Marco (especially with him as a Future Badass), things could get _very_ interesting.
