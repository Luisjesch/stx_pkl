_"His legs are dangling in a comical fashion — Oh! — it's the saddest thing I've ever seen!"_

— **Arnie Pye**, _The Simpsons_, "Children Of A Lesser Clod"

The frantic, often unrestrained kicking that occurs when a character, often a Victim of the Week or Monster Munch, is being killed or dragged away to their death. This is not for combat or targeted at anyone in particular, as the victim is usually just kicking at empty air, and the kicking typically doesn't help them in any meaningful way. It's especially common if the person/victim is being Eaten Alive.

This is usually a visual shorthand to portray the victim as helpless and communicate their panic/fear, particularly in instances where their head or indeed entire upper body isn't otherwise visible. Badass characters are usually not going to be shown going out like this, unless the story is trying to show how the thing or being killing them is so dangerous it reduces the toughest tough guy or Action Girl to just another helpless, flailing victim, or because said badass was caught off-guard.

Can be used as a type of Gory Discretion Shot, if we don't see what horrific things are happening to their upper body, but their kicking shows that, whatever it is, it's not pleasant for them.

If the victim is an attractive female with nice legs, it often gets combined with Fanservice and/or Interplay of Sex and Violence (even if unintentionally) as this trope by its very nature has some amount of Leg Focus.

While more often a horror trope, it can just as easily be played for comedy because the sight of a pair of legs flailing about can look rather goofy, especially in the right context and if the victim is ultimately alright once out of their predicament. And if the person's posterior is in the frame it adds a dash of Joke of the Butt too.

People carried off by a Kidnapping Bird of Prey or dangling in the grip of a Casually Powerful Giant are prone to doing this, implicitly as an attempt to shake themselves free or subconsciously find footing.

A common sight during a Vertical Kidnapping, and often a catalyst for Losing a Shoe in the Struggle, followed by a Dead Hat Shot. For the other end, see Last Grasp at Life.

If you were looking for kicking the helpless, that's Kick Them While They Are Down, not this trope.

    Advertising 

-   The poster for the film _Choke_ shows the silhouette of a woman's legs and high heels sticking out of a man's mouth and kicking like she's being Eaten Alive. Televised ads even showed the poor woman's weak little kicks in motion.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Happens often on _Attack on Titan_, owing to the fact that people getting eaten by mindless giants is part of the premise. Two notable examples are: a member of the Scout Regiment who, when his squad gets attacked by a group of titans, the last we see of him are his legs sticking out of a titan's mouth and squirming about right before it slurps him. The other is during the fall of Wall Maria when a panicked civilian woman gets plucked up and eaten by a titan. As she's carried out of frame one of her slippers falls off and lands in the foreground.
-   This happens often in _Blood-C_ whenever there's an Elder Bairn that can eat humans. Two prominent examples are the spider Elder Bairns who ambushes Saya's school and grabs one student who is screaming and helplessly kicking her legs until the Elder Bairns bites her and swallows her whole. Another is the Cerberus Elder Bairn in the final episodewhere it grabs Nono by the ankle and Nono futilely kicks the Elder Bairns' hand until the Elder Bairns rips her in half and grabs Kanako, who flails her legs while screaming, and tries to swallow her whole until Saya kills it.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_:
    -   Babidi desperately kicks his legs when he's grabbed by the throat by Majin Buu, who turns on him after Babidi threatens to seal him again.
    -   In the Cell Saga both androids 17 and 18 kick as they are being absorbed by Cell. 17's kicks, while no less desperate, are a bit more restrained of the two. 18, meanwhile, flails her legs far more wild and aggressively as she is being swallowed alive.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   Natsu is overpowered in his fight against Fukuro who proceeds to swallow him so he can absorb his magic, during which Natsu briefly twitches and kicks his feet as he is eaten head first.
    -   While being held by the dragon Zirconis, all Lucy can do is flail her legs in empty air out of fear of his intent to eat her alive after dragging (err, flying as it were) her into the sky. Even after narrowly avoiding being eaten alive by him thanks to her friends intervention, Lucy knows that Zirconis still intends to eat her, but all she can do is flail her legs in the air out of terror while still trapped in his grip.

    Films — Animated 

-   Played for Laughs in _The Jungle Book (1967)_, when Mowgli tries fighting Baloo, who effortlessly lifts him off the ground with both paws, pinning his arms to his side so all Mowgli can do is try repeatedly to kick at him, even though his legs clearly can't reach that far.
-   _Toy Story 2_: Played for laughs. Woody is pinned down by Bullseye and tickled by Jessie. When Andy's other toys arrive and witness the scene through a vent cover, they can't see much other than Woody screaming while flailing his limbs in the air, and conclude in horror that he is being tortured.
-   Played for Laughs in _Turning Red_. When Mei grabs her friends to stop them from loudly screaming, they flail their arms and legs until Mei calms them down.

However, his legs start kicking a lot more frantically when she tosses him in the air and catches him in her mouth.
