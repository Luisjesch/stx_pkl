So you've reached the end of the story. All the major problems and plot points have been resolved, and it's time for our heroes to ride off into the sunset. It's perfect.

...except, maybe it's a little _too_ perfect. Maybe it would feel a bit unrealistic, or it just wouldn't match the tone of the work, or you just want to end on a joke. That's where this trope comes in. At the very last second, a new problem arises and isn't resolved. Bam! End Credits.

Unlike the Sudden Downer Ending, this isn't intended to ruin the mood. It's still a happy ending! It's just a happy ending with a small joking nod to how things aren't perfect, and that's ok, and we trust that the heroes will deal with it somehow.

A cousin of And the Adventure Continues, but that trope would set the heroes off on a proper _quest_ that could plausibly be a whole plot by itself. This, in contrast, is just here as a joke. Compare also to The End... Or Is It?, where the villain is suggested to not quite be defeated.

Sometimes a sequel will be based on one of these, in which case the trope is retroactively subverted and transformed into a Sequel Hook. But if it wasn't intended to be taken that way in the first place, it can still be listed as an example of this trope.

May come about as a result of Something We Forgot. May overlap with Here We Go Again! or We Are Not Going Through That Again if the joke problem is similar to a problem from earlier. Or it could just be a Brick Joke coming back for the finale.

This is an Ending Trope, so spoilers will be unmarked!

    Anime and Manga 

-   The _Osomatsu-san_ Season 1 episode "ESP Kitty" spends its time picking through the inner thoughts of the cast and climaxing on Ichimatsu Matsuno revealing his massive insecurities to his brothers via the kitten. The episode ends with his brothers reassuring him and all of them going off in high spirits...all except Karamatsu, who was still hogtied and strung up from the episode's earlier segment.
-   In the _Doraemon_ episode "Monsters In The House", Doraemon accidentally breaks the Mess-O-Monsters canister, releasing all of the monsters inside and leaving him and Nobi to conceal this fact from his parents. At the end, the company sends an empty canister back in time to Doraemon so they can trap the monsters. All's fine, except Doraemon breaks the thing again, and the next available one is backordered for a whole month, so now they have to go through the ordeal for 30 days instead of one.

    Fan Works 

    Film — Animated 

-   _Astro Boy_: Astro Boy sees an alien appear just after Astro finishes defeating the Peacekeeper and President Stone's subsequent arrest, and the film ends with Astro flying off to fight it.
-   At the end of _Finding Nemo_, after Nemo, Marlin, and Dory have returned to the reef, we cut back to the dentist's office in Sydney to find that Gil and the other aquarium fish have escaped to the open sea — and they're still in their plastic bags, leading to the inevitable "Now what?" The look on Gil's face makes it clear that he hasn't thought this far ahead.
-   _Flushed Away_ ends with the Toad being defeated, Roddy and Rita getting together (resolving Roddy's loneliness), and Sid taking Roddy's place so that Tabitha still has a pet rat. However, Tabitha brings home a "new friend" for Roddy/Sid that's implied to be a cat, because a meow is heard.
-   _The LEGO Movie_ ends with Lord Business doing a Heel–Face Turn while The Man Upstairs learns to be a better father. Everything is great in the world of LEGO... and then suddenly Duplo blocks show up and declare war. Roll credits. This retroactively became a Sequel Hook in _The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part_, where the Duplo invasion is what causes the conflict of the film.
-   _Monsters vs. Aliens_: In The Stinger, to prepare for a discussion about repairing San Francisco after the monsters stopped the alien invasion, the President decides to press the giant red button that makes coffee. However, he accidentally presses the similar-looking giant red button that launches all the nuclear missiles instead.
    
    **President:** Time to wave the white flag and head for the bunker, boys. Let's check on the situation in 500 years. _\[looks into the audience\]_ Who wants to freeze my head?
    
-   At the end of _Toy Story_, everything is wonderful until Andy suddenly announces that he got a puppy for Christmas. Woody and Buzz look at each other with nervous smiles.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Alvin and the Chipmunks_: All four movies end with Dave yelling, "AAALLLVIIIIIIN!" because of something bad Alvin did, accidentally or not. We never find out how Dave has decided to punish him.
-   The ending of _Back to the Future_ was _supposed_ to be this trope, with Doc suddenly showing up to whisk Marty and Jennifer off to the future to sort out their own kids. However, when the film's unexpected success merited a sequel, this bit was retroactively turned into a straight Sequel Hook.
-   _Fanboys_: Set in 1998, after spending the movie traveling to Skywalker Ranch so their terminally-ill friend could see the then-unreleased _The Phantom Menace_ before his death, his friends finally get to see the film in its official release a year later. As they sit in the theater, waiting in anticipation after camping out on the line, Eric suddenly poses the question: "Hey guys... what if the movie sucks?"
-   _Freaky Friday (1976)_: The last line in the film had the father and son saying, at the exact same time, that they would like to switch minds and bodies themselves. It was a similar simultaneous utterance by the mother and daughter earlier in the movie that led to the movie's plot in the first place.
-   _Home Alone_:
    -   In _Home Alone_, Kevin defeats the bad guys, reconciles with his entire extended family, and helps his neighbor Marley reconcile with _his_ family in the meantime. The moment is suddenly ruined when Buzz shouts, "Kevin! What did you do to my room?!" But we're left to assume that Kevin will be okay in the end.
    -   _Home Alone 2: Lost in New York_ does it again. This time, everything is wonderful until Kevin's dad suddenly realizes how much money he spent on room service.
        
        **Buzz:** _(onscreen)_ Heh heh, Merry Christmas indeed. Oh, Dad...  
        **Peter:** _(offscreen)_ KEVIN!! YOU SPENT 967 DOLLARS ON ROOM SERVICE?!
        
-   _Jingle All the Way_: Howard spends Christmas Eve trying to get his son Jamie a Turbo Man doll. In The Stinger, his wife Linda asked him what he got for her on Christmas. This causes Howard to realize that he forgot to give Linda a gift.
-   Subverted in _Men in Black 3_. After Agent J comes back to 2012 after saving his partner Agent K from being killed by Boris the Animal as well as saving the Earth from a Boglodite invasion in 1969, Agent J reconciles with Agent K at a diner. However, Griffin, an omniscient being with knowledge of alternate outcomes, fears that a meteor will hit the Earth if Agent K forgets to pay a tip. Luckily, he remembers to do so and the meteor hits a satellite instead.
-   At the end of _Prince Caspian_, when the Pevensies have returned to their own world, Edmund looks at his siblings and asks, in a serious tone, "I don't suppose there's any way to get back?" When they look at him in concern, he explains, "I left my new torch<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in Narnia!" This gets a Call-Back when Edmund and Lucy go back to Narnia in _The Voyage of the Dawn Treader_: one of the first things Caspian does is return the torch, much to Edmund's amusement.
-   _Serenity_, despite the loss of two beloved characters, nevertheless ends on a triumphant note. The Alliance's evil has been exposed publicly, the Operative calls it quits, and it really seems that our heroes have made a difference in the end. The ship dramatically lifts off and flies off into space—and then suddenly (in a Brick Joke to the opening credits sequence) one of the flaps of the main thruster breaks off and Mal goes, "What was that?" Roll credits.
-   _The Santa Clause_: Scott embraces his role as Santa Claus, fixes his relationship with his son Charlie, and smooths things over with his ex-wife Laura. Things look rosy as he and Charlie take off in the sleigh to deliver presents when suddenly Laura starts worrying about how long they'll be gone. The film ends with her yelling at the top of her lungs while happy music plays in the background.
-   _Some Like It Hot_ famously ends with this trope. Jerry, who's been Disguised in Drag as a woman named Daphne for the whole film, has won the affections of Osgood Fielding III. As they drive off into the sunset, Jerry explains why "she" can't marry Osgood, but he happily rebuffs all of "her" arguments. Finally, an exasperated Jerry rips off his wig and reveals his actual gender — "I'm a _man!_"... and Osgood cheerfully replies "Well, nobody's perfect!" Notably, the writers didn't actually plan on ending the movie with that reply; it was supposed to be a placeholder until they came up with something funnier, but they were never able to top it.
-   _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ ends with Peter Parker getting his Spider-Man suit back from Tony Stark and putting it on in his room. However, it turns out Aunt May saw him put it on and shouts "What the f-" just as the credits roll. Later movies show that she is OK with her nephew being Spider-Man as she still lets him go on missions, but there's still the implication that Peter had some convincing to do to keep being Spider-Man.

    Literature 

-   As a Running Gag, early _Captain Underpants_ books always end with someone snapping their fingers near Mr. Krupp, making him transform into Captain Underpants and run away screaming "TRA-LA-LAA!", while George and Harold comment on it. Subverted from the sixth book onwards, when the gag is replaced with a more straightforward Sequel Hook.
-   At the end of the children's book _Clayton Parker Really Really Really Has To Pee_, Clayton has managed to find a bathroom and relieve himself, but now he has a new problem to deal with when an elephant sprays him in the crotch.
-   _The Courtship of Princess Leia_: During the early stages of the Love Triangle between Han Solo and Leia Organa's new suitor, Prince Isolder of the Hapes Consortium, C-3PO does some well-meaning-but-unhelpful digging to try and help Han and discovers he's descended from Corellia's old royal family (his cousins the Sal-Solos are established in other stories to still be Blue Bloods back home). Way later at the end of the book when Han and Leia have patched things up and are getting married, Threepio comes running up to Luke Skywalker telling him they have to stop the wedding because he made a mistake in his research: Han is actually descended from an infamous pretender to the throne. Luke tells the droid he'll take care of it — and then switches him off and stuffs him in a closet until the wedding is over.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Addams Family_: In one episode, Gomez gets hit on the head and loses his memory. At the end of the episode, Gomez's memory has been restored, but Fester got hit on the head in the process and the final line is him asking "Who's Fester?". It's left unclear whether he'd really lost his memory or was just joking, and in the next episode he's fine and it's never mentioned again.
-   _Black Mirror_: "USS Callister" ends with the _Callister_ crew free of Daly's control and realizing they can now explore the updated _Infinity_ game at their leisure... and they immediately have to escape the quadrant when an obnoxious player promises to "blast them into shit."
-   _The Brittas Empire_: "Wake Up the Lion Within" ends with the major plot lines of the episode (namely Brittas trying to win the European Award for Excellence and Carole dealing with a bossy alter-ego which turns her into a Bad Boss) resolved. Just then, a lion, which Colin had been keeping a secret from Brittas, proceeds to escape and hitches a ride at the back of the award-giver's car. Roll credits.
-   _Don't Hug Me I'm Scared_: At the end of "Family", after the main trio realizes the importance of family, Red Guy finally opens the bag of Chuddle Dollops that they were trying to open at the beginning of the episode...only to find just two pieces inside.

The last scene ends with the camera pulling out while an enraged Cliff drops a Cluster F-Bomb.
-   _Frasier_: In the season 3 episode Kisses Sweeter Than Wine, just as it seems as though a bribe has managed to get all the handymen out of Fraiser's apartment in time for his party guests arrival, does a loud flush come from the bathroom, followed by the last of the handymen exiting. Cue fade to black.
-   _Mako Mermaids: An H₂O Adventure_: "Only As Young As You Feel" ends with Rita, Zac, Evie, and Sirena returning to the grotto to find Ondina and Mimmi affected by the potion Ondina made earlier, which causes Emotional Regression. As the two of them argue like children, Rita shrugs and invites the others for tea, reasoning that the potion will wear off soon.
-   Became a Once an Episode thing when _She-Wolf of London_ was Retooled into _Love & Curses_. Ian and Randi stop a trio of witches who have been inflicting random transformations onto anyone who's the slightest bit rude to them? The episode ends with Ian messing around with their magic and accidentally turning them both into rabbits. They escape after being sucked into a monster movie that never made it through its first screening by helping it play out to the end? They get sucked into a TV show that lost its ending due to a technical malfunction.
-   The finale of _Kamen Rider Kiva_ has Wataru’s Kid from the Future Masaru burst into the wedding of Nago and Megumi to announce that a group of Neo-Fangires has begun an attack on the world. The three Kivas (Wataru, Masaru and the former’s brother Taiga) and IXA leap into battle to fight the threat along with the Arms Monsters.
-   A weird example in the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "Lonely Among Us", where — after the crew have been distracted from the two enemy alien races they're transporting by the Energy Being of the week — the "joke" problem is that one alien faction has possibly _killed_ a member of the other group _and wants the crew to cook it for them_. And this is completely Played for Laughs, with Picard dumping the situation on Riker, and everyone acting like this is a complicated situation, but not a serious one.
-   The _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode "Babel" is about a Curse of Babel virus endangering everyone on the station, originally stemming from O'Brien trying to repair the replicators so that Commander Sisko can have a decent cup of coffee. After the crisis is resolved and everyone has recovered, Sisko takes a sip of his coffee, nearly spits it out and snaps "O'Brien!" O'Brien is naturally annoyed that he's back to dealing with this.
-   The _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "A Piece of the Action" has Kirk and Spock having stopped the gang war between Oxmyx and Krako, with the implication that Sigma Iotia III is on its first babysteps to becoming a healthy democracy. Then, at the very end of the episode, Doctor McCoy has an Oh, Crap! moment: he accidentally left his communicator down on the planet when they left. Kirk takes it in stride, jokingly pointing out that as good as the Sigma Iotians are at reconstructing culture from one artifact, they may well form their own Starfleet and come looking "for a piece of _our_ action" someday.

    Podcasts 

-   _Listen Out Loud_ (_The Loud House_'s official podcast): One episode ends with Lana realising that she can still see the animals from the shelter even when they are adopted, apologising for being mean to the customers, and the customers adopting their new pets... however, she then realises that she still hasn't adopted out Greg the goat, who then eats her twin sister Lola's lipstick.

    Video Games 

-   _Fate/Grand Order_: The Part II of the "GUDAGUDA Final Honnoji" event ends with Mash informing everyone that they accidentally left Nagayoshi behind in the simulation and now there is a Singularity run by Berserkers.

-   At the end of _Sonic Heroes_, as the cast all begin to head off their own ways, Team Chaotix realise that Eggman hasn't paid them for the detective work he anonymously hired them for, then notice him trying to sneak off and proceed to give chase.
-   _Subnautica_: In The Stinger, the player is welcomed home to Alterra, but is denied permission to land until they've compensated the company for all the resources they collected and used while marooned on 4546B... which amounts to one _trillion_ credits.

    Webcomics 

-   _Fate/Gamers Only_: At the end of the Orleans storyline, the cast returns to Chaldea having successfully resolved the Singularity, Rikku hands the Holy Grail to Tomoe, and then runs off in embarrassment from remembering all the cheesy stuff she said.

-   _Fireman Sam_: The climax of "The Great Fire of Pontypandy" has everyone celebrating in the rain... until Radar finds sausages. Norman and his cousin Derek realise that it's _their_ sausages, and everyone is _extremely_ angry at them, because the sausages are the things that caused the forest fire in the first place.
    
    **Norman**: Oh, no! Radar has found our sausages!  
    **Sam**: What on earth's that?  
    **Steele**: Sausages?!
