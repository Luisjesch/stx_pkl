"Made you look!"

_"You're still here? It's over! Go home! Go!"_

In a nutshell, this is telling the audience the show is truly over. They can either wait for the next attraction or go home (especially if that was the final one).

Often presented as The Stinger, but other times it's a stock message. In children's shows, it's often delivered in song. If they do it often enough, it's an Every Episode Ending or Couch Gag. In modern times, Vanity Plates can serve the purpose.

Named for the line at the end of _Looney Tunes_ shorts that, between 1937 and 1946, was given to Porky Pig to say. (Which is why most usage of this particular line is rendered "Th-th-that's all, folks!")

**Remember that examples are not merely quoting the trope namer.**

Compare The End, Game-Over Man, Signing-Off Catchphrase. Often overlaps with Thanking the Viewer.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime 

-   _The Mysterious Cities of Gold_: At the end of the documentary segments, "Goodbye... till next time." For the first -and for a long time final- season's final episode, it was simply "Goodbye."
-   The ending theme for _Nerima Daikon Brothers_ is basically summed up as "Yeah, it matters to our characters, but we're just actors. Thanks for buying the DVD so we can get beer. Now watch the next episode!" You can hear the dub version here.
-   The "Pokérap" for the American dub of _Pokémon_ ends with "That's all, folks!" right after the final Pokémon is named.
-   In the final episode of _Sailor Moon_, Usagi says, "The end." Seconds later, the Inner Guardians say, "See ya!"
-   The last episode of _SD Gundam Force_ has one of these. It first seems like another Zako Zako Hour, only this one is hosted by the titular Gundam Force. They give their thanks for watching the series to the very end, followed by a curtain call of every character who ever appeared.
    
    **Grappler:** We're going to...  
    **Destroyer:** ...last...  
    **Zapper:** ..._Forever!_
    
-   The Japanese dub for the final episode of _Transformers: Animated_ had the show's entire cast sing the opening theme, and cheering after the song is over.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Prince of Persia: The Graphic Novel_, the last page shows a bunch of peacock feathers fallen over a book, accompanied by the message (presumably from Turul): "Book, like door, is for to be closed. Yaaahr."

    Films — Animation 

-   Disney:
    -   For films in the canon:
        -   After Bing Crosby finishes telling _The Legend of Sleepy Hollow_ in _The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad_, he wraps the movie up with, "Man, I'm getting out of here!"
        -   The ending of _The Aristocats_. And yes, it's those two dogs that attacked Edgar the butler twice in the film that tell us that the film is over.
        -   At the end of _Aladdin_, when the final Walt Disney Pictures logo appears, the Genie actually tells the viewers that the film is over and then bids them all goodbye.
            
            **Genie**: You've been a fantastic audience! Tell ya, what, you've been the best audience in the whole world! Goodnight, Alice! Goodnight, Agrabah! _¡Adios, amigos!_
            
        -   Hugo does this at the end of _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ where he says "Goodnight Everybody!"
    -   Disney's other animation studio, Pixar, has a few of their own:
        -   At the end of _Toy Story 2_, we see the tour guide Barbie doll telling the viewer, "Buh-bye now!" Of course, if you stick around to watch her tell people good-bye, she eventually stops and complains about how tired she is of having to do it.
        -   At the end of the credits of _Finding Nemo_, the Anglerfish appears one last time, only for it to be eaten up by a smaller fish, who swims away to end the movie.
        -   At the very end of _Soul_, Teri blurts out, "Oi! Movie's over! Go home!" This was a sign that the film was going to be shown in theaters, but the COVID-19 Pandemic forced the cancellation of the film's theatrical release in favor of a Disney+\-exclusive release.
-   _Happy Feet Two_: Sven does a variant of this in The Stinger, where he says "The Svend".
-   _Shark Tale_ ends with Ms. Sanchez the weaverfish telling everyone to go home because "it's past \[their\] bedtime."
-   In _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_, Spider-Ham says this right before returning to his home dimension, which prompts Peter B to ask if he's legally allowed to say that.
-   _An American Tail_ ends with Fievel and Tanya waving to the audience and shouting "Bye-bye!" as they fly away on Henri.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In the movie _Airplane!_, as Ted Stryker arrives in his cab to try to get Elaine back, a passenger gets into the cab. Before Ted runs off, he flips the fare flag down. After the end credits, the passenger is still there, having racked up a huge fare. Looking as his watch, he goes, "I'll give him twenty more minutes, but that's it!"

-   Mr. Bean does this at the end of _Bean_.
-   _Cool World_: At the end of the film, we get this exchange from Nails. Justified as this is Bakshi's last theatrically released film.
    
    **Nails**: Bye bye folks, have a nice life!
    
-   The Stinger for _Deadpool_ parodies _Ferris Bueller_ (see below). Deadpool steps out of the bathroom, wearing his mask, a t-shirt and a robe, saying, "You're still here? It's over! Go home. Oh, you were expecting a teaser for _Deadpool 2_? Sorry, we don't have that kind of money. You were expecting maybe Sam Jackson, in an eyepatch and a saucy little leather number? Go home!" He then turned around and announced that Cable would be in the sequel, and added, "And don't leave your trash lying around. That's a real dick move."
-   _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_: The second coda has the pizza stand guy from Earth-838 finally stop punching himself. He turns to the audience and delightedly declares "It's over!", "it" referring to either the spell that made him do that or the film.
-   _Ferris Bueller's Day Off_ has the title character emerging from the shower after the end credits, looking at the audience. "You're still here? It's over! Go home." Considering people were lured to stay through the credits because of Rooney's bus ride sequence, it can be considered a dirty trick on John Hughes' part. The same footage of Ferris Bueller was used at the end of _She's Having A Baby_.
-   _Get Him to the Greek_ featured the disembodied head of Sergio Roma saying, "Go home. Get the fuck outta this theater. Seriously."
-   Daffy Duck in _Gremlins 2: The New Batch_: "You're still here? Don't you people have homes?"
-   Ron Howard's 1986 comedy _Gung Ho!_ had two Japanese executives pondering a merger with an American company. One says "This is Looney Tunes!" When the second asks what he meant, the first quips "Th-th th-th th-That's all, folks!"
-   _Kangaroo Jack_ parodied this at the end, with the title character appearing in the _Looney Tunes_ bullseye, stammering "T-th-th-that's all, blokes!"
-   _Kiss Kiss Bang Bang_: The characters do this and even apologize for saying fuck so much.
-   The Finnish film _Kummeli Stories_ used this as an elaborate pseudo-Brick Joke: About halfway through the movie, a topless woman walks into the scene for no reason other than the fact that the movie wouldn't be complete without a pair of naked breasts, with the other characters promising "more titties after the credits". This continues into the actual credits, with "more titties after the credits" shown once or twice as a reminder... and after the credits finally finish, another character shows up, scolds the audience for being a bunch of perverts, and tells them to go home.
-   John Lennon's line at the very end of The Beatles' _Let It Be_ was humorous as well as bittersweet as the group was facing its demise: "I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we passed the audition."
-   At the end of _Looney Tunes: Back in Action_, Porky Pig attempts to deliver his famous catchphrase. Unfortunately for him, his stutter gets even worse than normal and after the lights go out he stops trying and, in an irritated tone, tells the audience to "Just go home, folks!"
-   At the end of _The Muppet Movie_, Animal tells the audience to "Go home! Go home! Bye, bye!" In _The Muppets (2011)_, the reprise of "Life's A Happy Song" has the line "The movie's almost over, it's time to say so long!" in it. At the end of the credits for _Muppets Most Wanted_, Fozzie shows up and says, "The movie's over, Ma. You can go home now." Possibly justified in that many fans of _The Muppet Show_ may have sat through the closing credits, expecting a Stinger of Statler and Waldorf having the last word.
-   Mike & the Bots returning after the final scene to actually riff on the credits of THEIR OWN MOVIE during the end credits of _Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie._ Example: Crow - "Since we're thanking the whole entire world, I would like to thank this guy I know named Earl...thank you, Earl."
-   In _On the Town_, every nightclub show in town ends with the song "That's All There Is, Folks."
-   The Movie of _The Producers_ musical has a brief additional song at the end of the credits. Everybody (including Mel Brooks) tells you goodbye and get out.
-   _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World_ ends after the credits with a "The End" and sprite of Scott from the game jumping in and busting up the text.
-   Also done after the end credits in _Space Jam_ when Bugs Bunny says the line. Porky Pig shows up and protests, then Daffy Duck shows up saying it his way, then the Nerdlucks push Daffy away and say the line, and finally, Michael Jordan pushes up the curtain saying, "Can I go home now?"
-   _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ ended with Porky saying his line, followed by Tinkerbell blanking the screen with her wand, _Disneyland_\-style. It also portrays Porky as just having come up with the line, when of course he would have been saying it for years by 1947.

    Live Action TV 

-   _Our Miss Brooks_: At the end of the episode "Buddy", Ricky Velasco states that although it would be "corny", it would be great if "The End" should appear above the cape he's holding. And "The End" appears.
-   From _All That_:
    
    "Hey Clavis! Wake up, the show's over."
    
    "Oh yeah, kick it!"
    
-   _The Tracey Ullman Show_: "Go 'ome! Go 'ome!"
-   _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ episode 33 ending.
    
    _\[Shot of seashore with waves breaking on beach. John Cleese walks on screen wearing an old Spanish soldier's costume\]_  
    **Cleese:** Um, I'm sorry about the ... the, er, pause, only I'm afraid the show is a couple of minutes short this week. You know, sometimes the shows aren't really quite as er, long as they ought to be. _\[He looks around\]_ Beautiful, isn't it. _\[He walks out of shot. Long pause - he walks back\]_ Look there's not really a great deal of point in your, sort of hanging on at your end, because I'm afraid there aren't any more jokes or anything. _\[Walks out of shot. Scene continues for a while.\]_
    
-   From _Just for Laughs_ and other programming under the banner: "MUMMY, IT'S OVER~!"
-   _The Carol Burnett Show_ Once per Episode:
    
    _I'm so glad we had this time together_
    
    _Just to have a laugh or sing a song_
    
    _Seems we just get started and before you know it_
    
    _Comes the time we have to say So Long._ Goodnight everybody.
    
-   _Saturday Night Live_ almost always ends with the cast on the stage waving goodbye as the Guest Host thanks the cast, musical guest, etc.
-   _The Mickey Mouse Club_ had the "Now it's time to say goodbye to all our company" variation of its opening theme.
-   _Roundhouse_: "Reprise the theme song and roll the credits!"
    -   One that was replaced in the series final episode by said at the ending: "Reprise the theme song and roll the re-runs!"
    -   _Whenever my life gets me so down, I know I can go down..._
    -   The Trope Namer was namedropped by David Sidoni, doing a Porky Pig impression, at the end of a sketch where some of the cast members read "letters home from great wars" in cartoon voices.
-   Nearly every episode of _Top Gear_ ends with Jeremy Clarkson saying "And on that bombshell, it is time to end" or a variant thereof.
-   The episode "Weekend Colonel" of _The Phil Silvers Show_ ends with Bilko, with Paparelli and the imposter, in the guardhouse, having been finally busted by Colonel Hall, looking towards the camera, and Bilko uttering this phrase.
-   The _M\*A\*S\*H_ episode "There Is Nothing Like a Nurse": Klinger says this after the home movie of Frank's wedding runs out.
-   The Vanity Plate for Ronald Moore's company for _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_. Each one was different and usually wacky and violent, which resulted in a gradually increasing case of Mood Whiplash as the series progressed.
-   The final episode of _Dinosaurs_: "This is Howard Handupme. Goodnight... Goodbye..."
-   One episode of _The Mary Tyler Moore Show_ actually ended with Mary saying "Th-th-th-th-th-th-that's all, folks!" - a reference to an earlier gag in which she complained about long-winded obituaries for notable individuals, suggesting this instead.
-   The Vanity Plate for _Taxi_ producer John Charles Walters features a man heading for his apartment, grumbling as someone says, "Goodnight, Mr. Walters."
-   The closing themes of some '50s sitcoms feature lyrics appropriate for the show's ending. Example, from _The Beverly Hillbillies_:
    
    "And now it's time to say goodbye to Jed and all his kin.  
    We sure would like to thank you folks for kindly droppin' in.  
    You're all invited back next week to this locality,  
    To have a heapin' helpin' of our hospitality.  
    Hillbilly, that is.  
    Set a spell. Take your shoes off.  
    Y'all come back now, y'hear?
    
-   This is a common trend in preschool shows, but it really became popular in the 90's. Here are some examples:
    -   _Barney & Friends_ provides a particularly well-known example: "I love you, you love me…" And you didn't read that, you sang it.
        -   Most of the Barney Says segments ended with Barney saying "And remember, I love you!" before the credits rolled. In the first two seasons, this was done in voiceover, but the next four had him appear in a corner of the screen (via stock footage) to wave to the audience.
    -   _Teletubbies_ would end with "Time for Tubby Bye-bye". The baby head sun would set and she'd have a rest herself. The Teletubbies really want to play some more, though...
        
        **The Narrator**: Bye-bye, Tinky Winky.  
        **Tinky Winky**: Bye-bye.  
        **The Narrator**: Bye-bye, Dipsy.  
        **Dipsy**: Bye-bye.  
        **The Narrator**: Bye-bye, Laa-Laa.  
        **Laa-Laa**: Bye-bye.  
        **The Narrator**: Bye-bye, Po.  
        **Po**: Bye-bye.
        
    -   _Blue's Clues_: "So long, but we'll just sing one more song!" Or if you were watching Joe's version in the final season - "Come on, help me say so long! Won't you help me sing the Goodbye Song? Bye! Buh-bye! See ya' lata'. Sweet potatuh!"
    -   _Out Of The Box_ had a goodbye song as well. "So long, farewell, to you my friends! Goodbye for now until we meet again..."
    -   _Bear in the Big Blue House_ fans, sing along. "Hey, that was really fun, we hope you liked it too, seems like we've just begun, when suddenly we're through..."
-   The final challenge of the 21st season of the U.S. version of _The Amazing Race_ was for the racers to identify the phrases for hello and goodbye used by the Pit Stop greeters at each country they visited. They all took a long time because this was the one thing they didn't pay attention to.
-   _Cheers_ had the final episode end with Sam telling someone showing up at the door:
    
    _Sorry, we're closed._
    
-   At the end of the final episode of _The Howdy Doody Show_, Clarabell the Clown spoke for the only time:
    
    **Clarabell**: Goodbye, kids.
    
-   _Hee Haw_ had both a goodbye tune _and_ a Looney Tunes-style catchphrase send-off.
    
    _(before the credits)_ We love the time we spend with you  
    To share a song and a laugh or two  
    May your pleasures be many, your troubles be few...  
    **Buck Owens:** So long everybody!  
    **Roy Clark:** We'll see you next week on...  
    **Everyone:** HEE HAW!! _(credits roll)_
    
    _(after the credits)_ **Cathy Baker:** That's all!
    
-   On _The Lawrence Welk Show_, Lawrence Welk's Musical Family would perform "Adios, Au Revoir, Auf Wiedersehen" during its syndicated run as its closing theme.
-   On _Mister Rogers' Neighborhood_, Fred Rogers would sing _It's Such a Good Feeling_ (and _The Weekend Song_ on Friday episodes), After his closing song, He would remark "You make each day a special day, By just being yourself! There's only one person in the whole world like you, And just the way you are! I'll be back next time! Goodbye!"
-   On _Sesame Street_, Different Sesame Street characters would announce the sponsors (usually one or two letters and one number) (For example: "Sesame Street has been brought to you today by the letters L, and Z, and by the number 10!") After the credits (mostly on Friday episodes), they would remark "Sesame Street is a production of The Children's Television Workshop!" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   On _The Sprout Sharing Show_, the characters would sing a Goodbye Song before an online promo played.
-   On _The Good Night Show_, Nina would say goodnight to Hush the Fish with help from the audience and sing "Hey, OK" before an online promo.
-   On_The Sunny Side Up Show_, the hosts would read fan mail or birthday cards during split-screen credits, tell the viewers to stay tuned for Sprout's other blocks, and sign off, before an online promo.
-   In the PBS Kids game show, _Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego_, Host Greg Lee, a contestant (a gumshoe), and the audience would sign off by shouting "DO IT, ROCKAPELLA," which would prompt the end credits to roll and said group to start singing the closing theme.
-   Subverted by Germanic Depressive "Bernd das Brot". He always desperately tries to convince the watcher to turn off the TV because he only wants to be alone in quietness. Needless to say, it doesn't work.
-   _Téléfrançais!_: Every episode ends with the characters saying "au revoir" to the viewer and waving. Often, the Announcer would cue this by telling them the show is almost over.
-   On the 1979 game show _Whew!_, "That's all, folks!" appeared on the "telly bellies" on the Gauntlet of Villains after a contestant failed to clear all ten.

    Music 

-   Annette Hanshaw, a flapper singer from The Roaring '20s, always ended her songs with "That's all!".
-   "Elvis has left the building."
-   The Beatles' _Let It Be_ was the last album the group released, and John's final quip "I'd just like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves and hope we pass the audition" would certainly be bittersweet. But since _Abbey Road_ was the last the group recorded, that distinction would go to the last line of "The End":
    
    And in the end  
    The love you take  
    Is equal to the love you make.
    
-   Paul McCartney has done this in recent concerts — in one he held at Abbey Road (which might air on a PBS station near you), he wrote a song in front of the audience, and the lyrics included "That's all for now! You've got to go home!" (Done very sweetly and melodically.) Since Paul recently has been known to try to continue concerts after the mike has been turned off, a formalized goodbye is necessary.
-   An ironic example by Genesis, "That's All". The song title is the final lyrics and the rest is instrumental until it fades out.
-   Unusual example: the final song of the Type O Negative album _October Rust_ cuts off abruptly (after 10 minutes of epicness) and then the lead singer says "Well, that's about it. That's all we have. I hope it wasn't too disappointing. We will see you on tour. Until then, take it easy."
-   Big And Rich's debut album _Horse of a Different Color_ included a nearly minute-long goodbye after the last song which was obviously unscripted.
-   Eric Idle and Neil Innes' "Rutland Weekend Times" has an instrumentalless finale which includes this couplet:
    
    \[The budget\] is how much we've got to make you bleeders smile  
    And we've went and overspent it by a mile
    
    -   An alternate version has this couplet:
    
    ...We've overspent our budget, could not have  
    Now there's nothing left to make you buggers laugh.
    
-   Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 45 is known as the "Farewell" Symphony — he and his musicians were kept at Prince Nikolaus Esterházy's summer palace much longer than expected, so at the end of the last movement, each musician stopped playing and left the stage, snuffing out their candle, until there were two violinists left. The prince got the hint and let them go the next day.
-   _Sesame Street_'s sing-along/play-along cassettes from The '80s invariably ended with a stern narrator announcing: "The tape is over. Please press the STOP button. Push it now." If you still hadn't pushed it after that, you got Oscar the Grouch sarcastically yelling: "WILL YOU PUSH IT NOW ALREADY?!"
-   Blue Öyster Cult: The song "Shooting Shark" ends with, "Fourth time round is the last time round; I have nothing else to say." Likely a subversion as this song is about repeatedly breaking up and getting back together.
-   A cappella novelty band _Instant Sunshine_ had a song called _Fleeting Time Now Bids Us Go_, a song about how they had to stop singing now. The joke was that it slowly built to a grand chorus, after which one of the singers didn't get the hint and kept going.
-   Billy Joel's last album ends with the song, "Famous Last Words".
-   Dan Wilson of Semisonic originally conceived "Closing Time" as a song specifically to end shows with. Even after it became a hit for the band, they continued to keep the song at the end of their setlist.
    
    _Closing time — Open all the doors and let you out into the world  
    Closing time — Turn all of the lights on over every boy and every girl  
    Closing time — One last call for alcohol, so finish your whiskey or beer  
    Closing time — You don't have to go home but you can't stay here_
    
-   Cold Chisel released "Saturday Night" in early 1984, three months after the band's first breakup. In the words of composer Don Walker: "The band I'd been in for ten years was breaking up. I think it's just a 'kissing all that goodbye and moving on into the unknown' song."
-   The first _Arthur_ soundtrack, _The First Almost Real Not Live CD (or Tape)_, has a Running Gag of D.W. trying to play "Crazy Bus" to no avail. At the very end, she succeeds, and when Arthur discovers this, D.W remarks "It's too late, the CD is over. Any moment now it will turn itself off..."
-   Split Enz's final album, "See Ya Round", was named for obvious reasons, after founder and lead singer Tim Finn left the group for a solo career.
-   A hilariously extended one is heard at the end of Insane Clown Posse's "3 Ring"; also doubles as a You Bastard! gag.
    
    **Sideshow Barker:** Well, that's it. I hope you're satisfied. I hope you had a good time, you fucking heartless bastards! You saw what you wanted, so grab your fucking kids, and that fat flop of shit wife of yours, and get the fuck out of our circus tent, you cold-hearted sons of bitches! You think _they_ look fucked up? Just wait 'til I kick your fucking lips in a couple of times. You'll be sitting up here like a bitch, and we'll be laughing at _your_ folded ass! They'll call you "Lumpy" after I done put knots all over your fucking forehead! Yeah! Hey - hey, little boy! Come here! How'd you like it if I tied your neck in a knot, you fucking little bitch? Come here! I'll shove that fucking corn dog up your ass! Get the fuck out of here! Show's fucking over! GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE, YOU FUCKING HEARTLESS BASTARDS!"
    
-   Lakeside's "Fantastic Voyage" ends with "That's all folks!," complete with stutter.
-   "My Baby" by Lil' Romeo ends with Romeo saying, "That's all folks!"
-   The Van Halen album _Diver Down_ ends with a cover of "Happy Trails."
-   Some versions of the alphabet song end with "Now I know my ABC's, next time won't you sing with me?".

    Newspaper Comics 

    Oral Tradition 

-   Armenian folk tales almost always end with some variant on the phrase "Three apples fell from heaven; one for the storyteller, one for the listener, and one for whoever pays good attention."

    Pinball 

-   Done at the end of _Space Jam,_ of course.
    
    **Porky Pig:** Th-th-th-th-th-that's the end of the game, folks!
    

    Radio 

-   _The Last Goon Show of All_ included the following pair of announcements after the outro music.
    
    **Andrew Timothy** (Announcer, to audience): Well, the recording is all right, so thank you for coming, ladies and gentlemen, and goodnight.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>   
    **Spike Milligan** (performer): Now _get out!_
    

    Theatre 

-   The lyrics to the last song in _The Producers_ (as mentioned above) can be summarized as, "The show's over, leave!"
-   The Genre Savvy cast of _Urinetown_: "That was our show!"
-   _Mass_: "The Mass is ended. Go in peace." (This is how the actual Catholic Mass usually ends.)
-   Every version of _Forbidden Broadway_ has ended with one of these, some longer than others.
-   At the end of _Cabaret_, the Emcee (who introduced the show with "Willkommen — Bienvenue — Welcome") sings, "Auf wiedersehn! À bientôt!" The implied last word, "Goodbye!", is never sung (but sometimes spoken as he takes his final bow).
-   The endings of the first two _Bottom_ Live stage shows used a large title card: "THAT'S IT. FUCK OFF."
-   _The Skin of Our Teeth_ ends with Sabina, after repeating part of her opening speech, telling the audience to go home.
-   _Pagliacci_ ends with Nedda and Silvio being stabbed to death onstage and Tonio (or, in many productions, Canio) declaring "La commedia è finita" ("The comedy is over").
-   When Monty Python's Flying Circus played the Hollywood Bowl, they ended with a card on the big screen reading "THE END". After a few seconds, this was replaced with one reading "Now piss off!"
    -   Their very last performance in 2014 ended with a longer version of the same joke:
-   _Our Town_:
    
    **Stage Manager**: Eleven o'clock in Grover's Corners—You get a good rest, too. Good night.
    
-   _The Phantom of the Opera_: "You alone have made my song take flight/It's over now, the music of the night!"
-   _Four Saints in Three Acts_ brings down its final curtain on Act Four following these lines:
    
    **Compère**: Last Act.  
    **All others** _(shouted)_: Which is a fact.
    

    Video Games 

-   _Final Fantasy_ does this with The End screen. A no-brainer usually, really, but with the series' tendency to hide extra endings after the initial ending cutscene and credits, The End screen is the only consistently sure way to tell that it's really safe to turn the game off without the fear of missing something. Even then, it's not a sure thing. Some of them play a version of the Prelude (you know, that theme with the up-and-down arpeggios) a minute or so _after_ the music stops and "The End" appears, a theme which can't be heard at any other point. Most people miss it unless they happen to leave the game running.
-   True to the source material, many _Looney Tunes_ video games have "That's All Folks!" as the Game Over screen, which shows up whether you lose all your lives or beat the game. They include, but aren't limited to _Looney Tunes (1992)_, _Road Runner's Death Valley Rally_, _Taz-Mania (Sunsoft)_, _Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions_, _Bugs Bunny: Rabbit Rampage_, _Porky Pig's Haunted Holiday_, _Sylvester and Tweety in Cagey Capers_, _Desert Demolition Starring Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote_, _Daffy Duck: Fowl Play_, _Looney Tunes Double Pack_, and the Game Boy Advance version of _Looney Tunes: Back in Action_.
-   _McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure_, after the credits, has a group picture of Ronald and his friends bidding the player goodbye.
-   Just before the prompt to save New Game Plus data, _Persona 3_, _Persona 4_, and _Persona 5_ put the word "Fin" on the last freeze frame, which features Aigis holding the MC's dying body in _3_ and the main character looking at a picture of him and his friends in _4_.
-   The shower scene at the end of _Tomb Raider II_.
    
    **Lara:** Don't you think you've seen enough? \*shoots the player with a shotgun\*
    
-   _The Secret of Monkey Island_ ends with a message telling the player to turn off the computer and go to sleep. The Video Game Remake instead says Guybrush Threepwood Will Return. The original version of _Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge_ ends with a (very) long list of suggestions for what to do now that you've completed the game. _Escape from Monkey Island_ did this again by showing an error message after the credits, telling the player to stop slacking off and get back to work. This was eventually removed via a patch, because anyone playing the game in the first place would be there to _play_, not to _work_.
-   Cruelly used at the end of _Sly 2: Band of Thieves_. After the credits roll, the player is told, "Well. That's it. You've seen everything. You win. Go outside." What's cruel about this is the game ended with a Sudden Downer Ending, with Bentley crippled, Murray's van lost, and the gang disbanded.
-   _Super Mario 64_: "Thank a-you so a-much for-a playing my game!"
-   The fiftieth and final board in _DX Ball_ has exploding bricks forming the words "The End".

    -   Strong Bad Emails almost all end with an off-screen printer printing and spitting out a page at the top of the screen with the link to email Strong Bad. (As of Email #202, it's been replaced with a Windows-style pop-up message to go with his new "paperless" setup, and with the introduction of the Lappier in Email #206 it was replaced with a CGI version of The Paper that provided a link to Strong Bad's twitter account.) Though it's not always the real end of the video, as seen at the end of "bottom 10".
        
        **Strong Bad:** No, there's no Easter Eggs. I'm not up to it. Go-... go away.

-   Again, Porky Pig is the Trope Codifier, even though Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid, who beat him to that line by several years, is the actual Trope Namer. He'd step out from being a sign with the _Looney Tunes_ name on it and say the phrase.
    -   While Bosko used "That's All, Folks!" for _Looney Tunes_, _Merrie Melodies_ shorts originally ended with the star of the particular short stepping out from behind a drum and saying "So Long, Folks!" As the _Merrie Melodies_ series quickly became a series of one-shots with no real regular characters, that meant every cartoon had a different character say the line.
    -   After Harman & Ising went to MGM, taking Bosko with them, his replacement Buddy would say the line. When Buddy was unceremoniously dumped for Beans the Cat, Beans briefly took over for the _Looney Tunes_ ending.
-   Meanwhile _Merrie Melodies_, despite still not having regular characters, actually gained a Jester mascot in 1934 who would give the final "That's all folks" (both series now using the same sign off). The self-writing script began in 1936 with Friz Freleng's _I Wanna Play House_, as did the iconic concentric color rings (which were originally blue to show off that they now had full-color three-strip technicolor instead of the limited palette of the two-strip version used previously).
    -   Because Porky's original voice actor had an actual stutter, he had significant trouble with the line, so despite Porky having supplanted Beans as the star of _Looney Tunes_ (to the point that it was studio policy that every cartoon released under that banner had to have Porky in it), starting with Tex Avery's _Gold Diggers of '49_ the series also used the self-writing script for a year. After Mel Blanc took over the role in 1937 they introduced the Porky-through-the-drum version used until 1946.
-   Two early Bugs Bunny shorts (and an a.a.p. print of a 1948 Daffy Duck short that had the wrong ending attached) also featured a variation with Bugs in which he'd appear in place of Porky and say "And dat's de end!" as Bugs was the star of those shorts.
-   After 1946, both series went to the script version, as by then the Porky requirement was dropped and the distinctions between the series consisted of nothing more than the title text and the opening theme music.
    -   In the 1960s, they stopped using the "That's all, folks!" phrase altogether at the end of cartoons, and now ended with a black background logo with an abstract modernized WB logo and the byline "A WARNER BROS CARTOON" (with the "OO" bouncing up and down) to a weird version of the closing theme.
    -   The 1990s short "Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers" (a riff on _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_) ends with a scary, Limited Animation version of Porky attempting to say the line, but Bugs kicks him out and places the real Porky in the drum. Take a look here.
    -   Said by the Ghost of William Shakespeare in "Mysterious Phenomena of the Unexplained: The Taming of the Screwball" in a Shakespearean style. "That, my dear folks, will be all."
    -   _Taz-Mania:_ "Willie Wombat's Deja Boo-Boo" closes out this way, with Taz taking the Porky Pig role.
    -   _The Looney Tunes Show_ continued the tradition with various characters saying the line, though in their own special way.
-   _Tiny Toon Adventures_ and _Animaniacs_, true to their roots would have different characters give one of these at the end of the closing credits. _Tiny Toons_ from their multicolored rings, and _Animaniacs_ from the Warners' Watertower.
    -   Yakko of _Animaniacs_ ostensibly had one in "Goodnight, everybody!", but this was most often used as an attempt to cut away from a Double Entendre or Demographically Inappropriate Humour.
    -   Slappy Squirrel had her own sign-off for her shorts—"Now _that's_—comedy!"—which was established in-universe to be the same one she used in her heyday as a Warner Bros. cartoon star.
-   _Histeria!_, the Spiritual Successor to the above two, didn't do it the same way, but its episodes often ended with scenes in which the characters said "see you next time" and shouted out the show's name. (Sometimes, though, there'd be one last 15-second skit right before the credits.)
-   _The Critic_: "Excuse me, sir, the show's over." Jay's response is a Couch Gag.
-   Cosmo tries to do this at the end of _The Fairly OddParents!_ special "Channel Chasers". The background was rectangular rather than circular.
    
    **Cosmo**: Th-Th-Th Th-Th-Th- Th-Th-Th-
    
    **Wanda**: Cosmo? What's wrong?
    
    **Cosmo**: (Shivering) Nothing. Its just really cold in here.
    
-   _Madeline_:
    
    "And she turned off the light...  
    and closed the door...  
    and that's all there is...  
    there isn't anymore."
    
-   _South Park_ gives Eric Cartman one of these right after he feeds a boy his own parents ground into chili (and got his favorite band to say he wasn't cool) since he got ripped off for $16.12.
-   Bat-Mite in _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_ ended every appearance of his this way. The final time was (despite the show being Lighter and Softer) a somewhat depressing moment of poetic justice. Bat-Mite is basically Mxyzpltk with Medium Awareness. In the series finale, he alters reality so the show will jump the shark and get cancelled so a Darker and Edgier series can take its place - which means the in-universe reality will disappear. The heroes fight to get things back to normal... but the show is cancelled anyway. However, similarly fourth-wall-proof Ambush Bug, who had helped the heroes try to save their reality, reminds Bat-Mite that he's part of the fiction - and a Darker and Edgier show has no place for a wacky character like Bat-Mite, so he will cease to exist as well. When Bat-Mite, who initially responded with a This Cannot Be!, is disappearing piece by piece and finally accepts his end, he says "I guess it can." He turns to the screen and does the classic wave, saying "That's all, folks." At this point, the part of Porky Pig's body that shows through the Iris Out hole in _Looney Tunes_' "That's All, Folks" sequences - his head and one arm - is all of Bat-Mite that still exists. He then fades forever - it's deserved, but _damn._
-   One episode of _Ed, Edd n Eddy_ had Double D request for a "iris out" to end the episode, having tired of Eddy's stupidity for the day. The Movie, after the credits, ended with Jonny asking the question "What movie?", after Plank "tells" him its too late to exact his revenge since the movie (and in turn, the series) is over.
-   _Muppet Babies_: "Gooooooooo bye-bye!" \*laughs\*
-   A cartoon-focused episode of _Beetlejuice_ ends with the title character in an Iris Out saying, "That's it, kids!"
-   On the _Futurama_ episode "Reincarnation", with Bender saying "Th-th-th-that's all you get, jerks!"
-   The Mexican policeman from the Underdog Productions logo.
-   _Tex Avery MGM Cartoons_: the end of _King Size Canary_, the cat and mouse are now both the size of planets due to them consuming a magic potion that can turn them into giants. However, at the end of the short, the bottle containing said potion is now empty, and therefore the cat and mouse cannot change back and as a result the mouse tells the viewers that they actually have to end the picture because of this.
-   Every episode of _KaBlam!_ ends with Henry and June saying goodbye to the audience, and then the show's announcer going, "Join us again next time, same _KaBlam_ time, same _KaBlam_ network!".
-   "We're saying goodbye to Muzzy, we're saying goodbye to you!"
-   The Show Within a Show "Mary Moo Cow" on _Arthur_ usually ends its episode with Mary saying goodbye in some way. In the episode featuring "The Love Ducks", the narrator says "Goodbye, Love Ducks!" and the ducks sing "Quack, quack, quack!" as they fly away into the clouds.
-   _Celebrity Deathmatch_ would usually end with Johnny Gomez saying, "Good fight, goodnight."
-   Mickey Mouse would usually do some variation at the end of _House of Mouse_. He even said "That's all, folks!" in one episode before catching himself.
-   The last words (If including the end credit songs as well as dialogue) of the _Daria_ TV Movie Grand Finale, _Is It College Yet?_ came from the second song of the ending credits, "Time to Go" by Supergrass (TV version only; the DVD releases have replaced it due to music rights).
-   The ending to the final episode of _Doug_ (the Disney episodes) had Doug calling out to the audience, "Bye, everyone! It's been fun!"
-   _The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!_: "Until next time, everybody... DO THE MARIO!"
-   The _Robot Chicken_ sketch "8 Carrot" has _Looney Tunes_ characters parody _8 Mile_. DJ Bacon Bits ends the segment with "That's all, bitches."
-   _Ultimate Spider-Man_: In the episode "Run Pig Run", the ending spoofs Porky Pig saying "That's All, Folks!" with Spider-Man.
-   _Turbo F.A.S.T._: At the end of the episode "Hardluck Hardcase", Skidmark delivers one of these completing the Road Runner parody, although he awkwardly realizes that as it was the first short of the episode, the show isn't actually over yet.
-   _Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"_: At the end of the episode, "Ren Seeks Help", there is a parody of the _Looney Tunes_ signoff appears with Ren, Stimpy, Mr. Horse, the frog, and the injured asylum worker (still with his hand bitten off) smiling at the audience from inside the circles.
-   _The Simpsons_: Done twice on The Krusty the Klown Show. The first was when Sideshow Bob hosted and sang Cole Porter's "Every Time We Say Goodbye". Another time Krusty sang "We've had lots and lots and lots and lots of fun, but now the time has come... to go. If this old clown was found dead in his bed tomorrow, I'd be in heaven, still doing this show!''
-   A majority of Betty Boop's cartoons ended with her saying her well-known Character Catchphrase, "Boop boop be doop".
-   Every episode of _Blue's Clues_ ended with Steve (or Joe) singing the "So Long Song" and then saying goodbye to the audience. The direct-to-video movie _Blue's Big Musical Movie_ ends with Blue holding up a cardboard card reading "Thanks for coming to Blue's Big Musical" while she barks out "Bow bow bow-bow!" ("Thanks for coming!") before the credits start. At the end of the credits, one more cardboard card appears that says "Bye-bye", and Blue barks it out to the audience while waving.

    Real Life 

-   Mel Blanc's tombstone<small>◊</small>.
-   Standard bar or pub line at closing time: "This is the last call. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here." There was even a song with lyrics almost exactly like the above ("Closing Time" by Semisonic).
-   Windows 95, upon being shut down, would "end" on a blank screen except for the message "It is now safe to turn off your computer." Newer versions of Windows also would do the same, if run on PCs that cannot just turn themselves off instead of waiting for the user.
-   In the U.K., certain phones on Virgin Mobile service, such as the Kyocera Jax, print "BYE" to the screen when turned off.
-   Virtually all data transmission standards specify "End of Stream" or functionally similar code. Data that, for whatever reason, comes after such code is treated as though it doesn't exist.
-   Many electronics with front screen displays, such as stereos or DVD players say "Goodbye" or some variant on the display when they are turned off.
-   Users of teletypewriting (i.e. phone service for the deaf) type "SK" when they are finished with their conversation.
-   During the days of analog TV transmission, sign-offs for the night would usually be announced several minutes beforehand, often including the national anthem of a certain country (coupled with sermonettes from a local church leader and/or "High Flight" for U.S. TV stations). This has since become redundant with the advent of 24/7 broadcasting and digital transmission. The switch from analog to digital also doubled as a form of this, as well as an End of an Age of sorts.
-   "That's all folks!" was used as the final slogan for the Blockbuster video service, once the biggest movie rental chain in the United States.
-   AMC Theatres has end bumpers played at the very end of movies in their theaters, saying the viewer should sign up for AMC Stubs, before adding "Now go home already!"
-   During the New Orleans Pelicans' final home game of the 2018–19 NBA season, Pelicans superstar Anthony Davis, who had requested a trade while all but publicly announcing that he would leave the Pels as a free agent after the 2019–20 season, wore a T-shirt under a suit jacket on the sidelines (he was out with back spasms) that read "That's all Folks!" in the classic Looney Tunes script. He would get his trade to the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2019 offseason.
-   In the United States, Cartoon Network shares its channel space \[adult swim\], the latter also having begun life as the former's late-night adult-oriented programming block before coming to be considered its own, separate channel. Due to the sudden demographic change, both networks have utilized various sign-off messages every night and morning to signal the change between networks, with the ones for the transition between CN and \[as\] hammering home that it's time for the kids to go to bed (not that the kids will listen, mind you).
-   In the Roman Catholic Church, Mass usually ends with a deacon announcing "Mass has ended, go forth in peace" or some accepted variation on that phrase.
-   The final transmission of the East German "Gong" numbers station consisted of a group of drunken-sounding men singing the German children's song "Alle meine Entchen", a song about ducklings. The usage of the song in that context is believed to have been a metaphor telling any agents ("Alle meine Entchen/all my little ducklings") listening that, since the GDR was in the midst of reunification and the Stasi was close to being no more, they needed to remain covert ("Köpfchen in das Wasser/head in the water") and assume new identities ("Schwänzchen in die Höh/tails in the air").
