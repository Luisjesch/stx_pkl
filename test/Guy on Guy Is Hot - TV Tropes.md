_"I have this 'Jules and Jim' fantasy, definitely — you know, two men and a woman in love. And I remember reading in a magazine that the high you get from falling in love only lasts about four years. So with two men, you might be able to make it last eight."_

— **Dana Delany**

In the West, we are raised to believe that Girl on Girl Is Hot, and the media typically shows this because Most Writers Are Male. No questions! But in the East, it is the Spear Counterpart Guy On Guy Is Hot that is the sexual stimulant. While not as strong in the West (despite the growing number of Slash Fic) the way its Sister Trope is, it is the existing mentality in much of East and South East Asia. It's the reason for the Boys' Love Genre and the times when Homoerotic Subtext is played intentionally as a fetish. Some authors adhere to this or at least acknowledge its existence, and thus we get scenes of naked and half-naked men wrestling in mud, jello, or oil.

Just as often, though, there is a heavy Double Standard, and on both sides; straight men thinking Girl on Girl Is Hot tends to be dismissed as normal behavior, whereas the female enjoyment of Guy-on-Guy will be treated as a perversion (see Yaoi Fangirl). Or, in the other direction, some women will proudly declare their fascination with gay guys doing it, or the said women are portrayed as the harmless Fag Hag, while men who eroticize lesbians are denounced as exploitative perverts.

There are, in some cases, elements of But Not Too Gay to this trope: some women enjoy watching men wrestle and make out, but unlike men lusting after two women in such a scenario, it may be implied that they wouldn't find it sexy if the situation were to "escalate." However, large portions of fanfiction.net, Tumblr, and even a cursory visit to DeviantArt and Pixiv suggest otherwise, as does the fact that so many M/M (male/male) stories with explicit sex scenes are written by and for women. In fact, this trope has created a stigma to the point that many gay men actively avoid M/M romances by female authors due to their likelihood of catering to straight women's fantasies rather than resembling an actual gay man's life. Curiously, the demographic of men who enjoy the Yaoi Genre the most are bisexual men.

This trope is the basis of about 99.9% of all Slash Fic.

## Examples:

    Anime & Manga 

-   This trope is a large part of _Hetalia: Axis Powers_'s raison d'être. France spends most of his time stripping and/or groping the other male characters, Italy has a habit of glomping or sleeping with Germany while naked, and the series even has its own resident Yaoi Fangirl, Hungary.
-   Erika from _Durarara!!_ thought that Shizuo and Izaya made a wonderful couple. Her friends disapproved but, surprisingly, Shinra agreed with her (or at least thought it made sense in some way. Celty forbade him from actually finishing that thought). Not to say this is the general reaction to most fans about this pairing in general. It also doesn't help that Narita finds enjoyment in teasing the ship.
-   Ohno and Ogiue from _Genshiken_ love their yaoi, although the latter is loath to admit it at first.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Konohamaru's Sexy No Jutsu had two shadow clones transform into a nude Sasuke and Sai locked in a very suggestive pose. It even gave Sakura a nosebleed. It got cut in the anime, but it's still in the manga.
    -   In the English print of this manga scene, the male on male part was nearly blacked out entirely, while the girl on girl scene only needed a few extra clouds to censor naughty bits. Major Double Standard on VIZ's part. Remember kids; getting the hots for naked ladies together is okay, but you're not allowed to even look at two guys. EVER!
-   For once played for drama in _Ōoku: The Inner Chambers_. When Shogun Tsunayoshi is developing God Save Us from the Queen! tendencies, she orders two of her male concubines to have sex for her entertainment, thinking they won't mind since she knows them to be lovers. They're so insulted at being used for voyeuristic thrills that they attempt to commit seppuku, giving her a salutary shock.
-   This is Hikaru and Kaoru's entire shtick in _Ouran High School Host Club_, with the twincest angle to spice things up. And it's never entirely clear if it's just an act or not.
    -   Many of the girls are also turned on by the Moe that is Honey and Mori, who are cousins by marriage and very much toe the line between brotherly platonic love and something... _more_. It helps that a girl who was crushing on Mori recognized that Honey is the primary object of Mori's affections.
-   Meirin of _Black Butler_ certainly thinks this. Though with the amount of Bishōnen and Ho Yay that occurs it's not like you could blame her. The series also has an abundance of real life yaoi fangirls.
-   One of the OVA for _Fairy Tail_, set during the _Grand Magic Games_ arc, takes place in a huge water park. Juvia is trying to convince Gray to go on the Love-Love waterslide with her, which is basically a tunnel of love in waterslide form, but Natsu accidentally knocks Gray and Leon onto the slide instead. Juvia is suddenly fascinated by her main crush embracing another guy on a romantic attraction. In reality, the two are just clinging to each other because of the terrifying speed of the slide. Of course, Juvia herself ends up on the slide with Lucy later on; the OVA is pretty much one long Ship Tease.
-   The first episode of _Osomatsu-san_ has Osomatsu and Jyushimatsu kiss after accidentally unraveling each others' clothes during the F6 segment. Despite Totoko covering her face for modesty, you can clearly see her move her fingers out of her eyes and blush. Note that this only applies to their pretty boy forms; around the actual brothers, she treats them as she always did.
-   One chapter of _The World of Moral Reversal_ has one of the main characters try to rent out a gay porn DVD without getting caught. Since this is taking place in a Gender Flipped setting where girls are expected to have the All Men Are Perverts mindset and associated libido, it's assumed to be a normal occurrence the way Girl on Girl Is Hot is thought to be with boys in this world.
-   Played for Laughs in _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ when a series of coincidences make it seem like Shirogane is in a homosexual relationship with a cross-dressing Hayasaka. Fujiwara visibly gets a nosebleed upon hearing this.
-   In _Anime-Gataris_, the Anime Club is saved from disbanding after a substantial number of girls in the audience vote in favor of them. Why? After Kai Kai makes a passionate speech in favor of keeping the club, Nakano (the school's resident pretty boy) helps him up _very_ intimately after his glasses fall off (showing off Kai Kai's pretty eyes in the process).

    Comic Books 

-   The _Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season Eight_ comics show that Buffy's fantasy is her, chained up, dressed like a nurse, with naked Spike and naked Angel.
-   In Alan Moore's _Lost Girls_, Dorothy tells two bellboys that she's always wanted to see two guys getting it on. She gets hot and bothered watching Rolf and Harold fighting, as it looks like they're having sex (of course they did earlier, but she didn't know that).

    Fan Works 

-   Quoting the infamous fanfic _My Immortal_: "don't u fik gay guyz r lik so hot!". The Harry Potter characters like Harry and Draco Malfoy were turned into bisexual men just for them to enter in a relationship between themselves and protagonist, Ebony Darkness Dementia Way. Other characters in the book series likewise were turned bisexual.
-   Story of _Utter Tripe Reviews_ apparently has this mentality. Things get awkward when one of her fellow riffers finds out that her search history includes pictures of her crush and one of his friends doing it on a table.
-   The _ER_ fanfic _The Eternal Quadrangle_ has Abby and Kerry walking in on Carter and Luka going at it. Afterwards, Luka hurriedly assures Abby that he still has the hots for her, only to have her cut him off:
    
    **Abby**: I would be mad. . .if it weren't the hottest thing I'd ever seen.
    
    -   A later chapter has Abby and Kerry getting so aroused at the sight of the two men having sex, that _they_ have sex.
-   _A Dance on the Mats_:Twilight and Fluttershy are...ecstatic when Anon reveals that Caramel has a gay crush on him. Fluttershy even has a Nosebleed.
-   In _Hawkmoth Gets A Reference_, the heroes try to make a shipping-based akuma come and face them by hitting her Berserk Buttons. Viperion attempts to do so by yelling "Adrichat", and is forced to instantly hit the Reset Button... Ladybug is out cold with a Nosebleed.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   See the plot to every _Eating Out_ movie.
-   In _Get Smart_, when Max appears to be humping a male Control agent (he's actually trying to pull him off the table), a guard, in a rare male example, walks by and looks a little too interested before being pulled away.
-   In _The Kids Are All Right_, the lesbian couple enjoys watching gay porn together.
-   In _The Pink Panther Strikes Again_, when Clouseau is attempting to revive Dreyfus at the insane asylum (from behind), two women think that he's attempting to make out with him. The older one snaps, "Don't look, Fiona!", but Fiona seems pretty eager to watch.
-   In _The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement_ (which is a Disney movie aimed at pre-teen girls, just so we're clear), there is a scene where Mia and her best friend Lilly are looking at prospective princes. Mia remarks that one prince shown is cute, to which her bodyguard Joseph replies, "His boyfriend thinks he's handsome also." Mia and Lilly's reaction is... enthusiastic.
    
    **Mia and Lilly:** _(punch the air)_ Right on.
    
-   In _Tamara_, the titular Hot Witch villain uses her powers to brainwash Patrick and Shawn into making out and having sex with each other for her enjoyment. In this case, what turns her on is the humiliation, as Patrick and Shawn were a pair of Jerk Jocks who date raped numerous girls, and she wanted to turn the tables on them.
    
    **Tamara:** I want you to know what it's like to feel helpless. To be taken advantage of. So... who's gonna pitch and who's gonna catch?
    
-   From _The Waterboy_:
-   In _Run Fat Boy Run_, Dennis and Gordon oversleep and have to race to the marathon in a cab, Dennis thrashing around trying to get dressed as they go. When they stop at a traffic light, they notice there's a woman looking into the cab at Dennis in his pants straddling Gordon... and she seems to be enjoying the show.
-   In _Plan B_, Bruno and Pablo jokingly tell their friend Ana that they're boyfriends who are madly in love and Ana goads them into kissing each other in front of her to prove it, adding that she's similarly kissed girls before for other guys' enjoyment.
-   _Macho Dancer_: Unsurprisingly featured in a film about the gay prostitute world. Many of the shows at Mama Charlie's rely on homoeroticism for the audience, such as Noel and Pol's routine where they bathe each other while simulating sex.

    Literature 

-   _Anita Blake_. Two guys together gets Anita and Belle Morte off.
-   _One Hundred Strokes of the Brush before Bed_ by Melissa P. The Fille Fatale protagonist has a Gay Best Friend who arranges for two men-friends to have sex while she watches, as part of her journey of sexual discovery.
-   _Millennium Series_: In _The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest_, it's revealed that Erika and her husband have occasionally participated in threesomes with a male friend of theirs. Erika outright says that she can't decide which is sexier — to have two men pleasuring her simultaneously or to watch her husband with another man. Her greatest fantasy is to have her on-again/off-again lover Blomkvist join her and her husband in the bedroom, and her greatest disappointment is that he is adamant that this will _not_ happen, him having no bisexual inclination.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   In "Chosen", Buffy gets annoyed with the mutual jealousy of her two vampire ex-boyfriends and suggests putting them in a room together then have them get naked and wrestle it out while she watches. When Spike says it's fine with him, her eyes widen with excitement and she adds, "There could be oil involved..." Note that this trope is a view held by much of the show's fanbase as well.
    -   Likewise vampire, in "Fool for Love", Darla and Drusilla openly enjoy the sight of Spike and Angel coming to blows, or as the DVD Commentary put it, "getting ready to ram their stakes through each other."
    -   Also Harmony in "Crush":
        
        **Harmony** I told you: No threesomes unless they're boy-boy-girl. Or Charlize Theron.
        
-   There was a skit on _The Chris Rock Show_ where two men cross paths on the street and it looks like they're about to fight… and they make out instead. All you can hear from the audience is women squeeing. You can watch it here (even if the end was just spoiled out of necessity). While hilarious, the clip is sadly a case of artistic license, as racial bias and tension have long been a sore point in the gay community.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "Deep Breath": Strax scans Clara's subconscious and finds images of what he generously interprets as "young men playing sport."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
        
        **Strax:** It _could_ be sport...
        
    -   Referenced by Captain Jack in "Journey's End". Upon seeing three versions of the Doctor, two of whom are David Tennant in a tight suit, he comments: "I can't even tell you what I'm thinking right now." Much of the fandom would probably agree.
-   In the _Farscape_ episode "Won't Get Fooled Again", one of the many crazy scenes involves a Camp Gay D'Argo propositioning John. Apparently, Chiana wants to watch…
-   In one _Friends_ episode, Rachel had an Erotic Dream that featured Chandler. Later, it also included Joey, then Rachel mentions that sometimes it was _just_ Chandler and Joey. The guys leer until they realise what that means.
-   One of the Patients of the Week on _Grey's Anatomy_ was a gay soldier. Once his boyfriend comes to visit him they are alone and proceed to make out. Meredith Grey walks by and stares at them with much interest.
-   In the Tudor Porn sketches in _Monty Python's Flying Circus_, Sir Philip's wife is fond of reading "Gay Boys in Bondage".
-   _Noah's Arc_: Brandy finds two guys together quite sexy, though overall the trope goes without saying for the LGBT genre (at least on the male end).
-   A meta-example: _Queer as Folk_ was a show about gay men and their relationships and sex lives. Its primary audience was meant to be gay/bi men and, to a lesser extent, lesbians. Yet it gained a huge fanbase among straight women.
-   _Saturday Night Live_ has a recurring skit called the "Kissing Family" which features a considerable amount of intense guy-on-guy kissing. Inevitably there will be squeals of delight which overpower the laughter.
-   _Scrubs_: Jordan believes this, and apparently isn't too fussy about the age of the men involved.
    
    **Jordan:** We should have sex later.  
    **Dr. Cox:** _(unnerved)_ How did you get from that image to that thought?
    
-   There was an episode of _Sex and the City_ where the girls rent gay porn for this reason and watch it together.
-   _State of Play_: A homosexual member of the newsroom mentions he just slept with the man they've been investigating. When he asks if they want him to go into detail the men immediately say "No!" while the female journalists have exactly the opposite response.
-   In the _Supernatural_ episode "The Monster at the End of this Book", Sam explains to Dean that some of the fans of the in-show duo are into shipping them.
    
    **Dean:** Don't they know we're brothers?  
    **Sam:** I don't think they care.  
    **Dean:** That's sick!
    
-   These scenes from _True Blood_ were probably inserted for this reason.
    
    "All this alpha-male posturing. Why don't the two of you just fuck each other and get it over with? I could watch."
    
-   _Will & Grace_:
    
    **Grace:** Gay sex is so hot!
    
    -   And this:
        
        **Jack:** We'll have a steak, watch a movie… you like gay porn, right?  
        **Grace:** Who doesn't?
        
    -   Karen too, natch:
        
        **Karen:** I haven't rooted this hard for a gay couple to get together on TV since Frasier and Niles.  
        **Will:** They were brothers.  
        **Karen:** _(sigh)_ I know.
        
-   _Oz_: There are countless Internet spaces devoted to (mostly female) fans poring over the most squee-worthy moments between Beecher and Keller.
-   _Sunrise On 7_: Apparently, reporter Edwina Barthowlmew thinks that gay sex is hot when she interviews A.J. Roach of the Australian men's water polo team at the 2012 London Olympics:
    
    **A.J. Roach:** It's a great spectacle. Especially guys running around in their speedos, wrestling and pressing up against each other. So it's a good sport to watch.  
    **Edwina Barthowlmew:** That sounds like the Greek Olympics.
    
-   Subverted on _MADtv (1995)_: The Vancome Lady tells her gay neighbors who are dressed like pirates while trick or treating with their kids:
    
    **Vancome Lady:** And by the way, you two need to learn how to close your blinds alright, I'm tired of watching you two play bury the treasure.
    
-   In this clip reporter Susannah Collins cheerfully reports that the Chicago Blackhawks have been having a lot of sex with each other.
-   In the _Seinfeld_ episode "The Outing", George visits his mother in the hospital and finds himself getting uncomfortable at the sexy silhouettes of the handsome, well-built male nurse giving his equally good-looking male patient a sponge bath.
-   _Lucifer (2016)_: Lucifer and Pierce are Undercover as Lovers. When Lucifer gives Pierce a Forceful Kiss to maintain their cover that they're gay, Chloe (who's working Mission Control) rushes over to the window to get a direct look.
-   _Motherland: Fort Salem_: Abigail stops the two men she has a threeway with and watches them kiss for a moment before becoming bored.
-   Occasionally played for laughs in _Parlamentet_. During _Tips från coachen_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , the teleprompters will occasionally give out prompts like "Now or never Johan..." or "Confess your love for Magnus" where a kiss would be the best punchline for the prompt. Since most of the comedians who get these prompts happen to be male, the end result is two guys making out on stage while the live audience cheers them on very loudly.

    Music 

-   The Peaches song, "Two Guys (For Every Girl)" is about Peaches wanting to see her men have sex with each other.
-   The Go-Gos' cover version of the Jan and Dean threesome song is about both kinds of 2-guys-1-girl threesomes:
    
    _And we go to Surf City 'cause it's two to one  
    Go to Surf City, gonna have some fun  
    Go to Surf City 'cause it's two to one  
    Go to Surf City, gonna have some fun  
    Go to Surf City 'cause it's two to one  
    Two boys for every girl_
    
-   Britney Spears is suggesting a bisexual MMF threesome as well a bisexual MMMF foursome in "3":
    
    _1, 2, 3  
    Peter, Paul and Mary  
    Gettin' down with 3P  
    Everybody loves counting, ohhh  
    Count 'em_
    

    Music Videos 

    Radio 

-   Parodied by Howard Stern on _The Howard Stern Show_ with his song "Every Homo (Backside's Back)'', which is a parody of "Everybody (Backstreet's Back)" by Backstreet Boys.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder… well, there's the "My First Slash" goal, the "I'm Not Gay I Swear" goal, the "Quite" goal, and then there's the pictures of "Life-Threatening Illness" and "They fight crime" and then there's… basically, the game all but states Twilight loves this trope.

    Theatre 

-   Lampshaded in _Ride the Cyclone_. Mischa gets in-character in the role of "random John soliciting a prostitute" during Noel's song, "Noel's Lament", and delivers a passionate kiss during the finale. Their classmate Constance gets very, very invested in the action, even after the song is over.
    
    **Constance:** I'm still distracted. I'm still thinking about that time those two boys kissed.
    
-   Cirque du Soleil's adults-only show _Zumanity_ has a Belligerent Sexual Tension sequence involving two gay men doing a violent tango in a cage.

    Video Games 

-   In _Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten_, it turns out that the female half of the party is more than a little interested in the relationship between Valvatorez and Fenrich. Some of the Player Mooks even write Slash Fic.
-   In _Shadow Hearts: Covenant_, after you beat The Great Gama in Joachim's sidequest, he passes on his abilities to Joachim by engaging in some off-screen gay sex with him in the wrestling ring right in front of the whole party. While Juri isn't especially thrilled to see this, Anastasia comments that she finds it "beautiful".
-   In _Deiz_, one of the endings has a director kidnapping you and your best friend and forcing you to make out on camera because of this trope.
-   Nina from _Fire Emblem Fates_ is the resident Yaoi Fangirl whose wild fantasies will take flight whenever she sees two men so much as talking to each other and wishing they were far more intimate than just being friends. Her Spear Counterpart is Soleil, though she really likes to be on the receiving end of Girl on Girl Is Hot, unlike the opposite-gender shy Nina.
-   In when Dusa learns of Zagreus and Megaera's relationship in _Hades_, she reacts as any good supportive friend would. When Dusa learns that Zagreus is dating Thanatos, however...
    
    **Dusa:** You're, _whew...!_ Makes me a little woozy just remembering it now!
    
-   Coco in the _Galaxy Angel_ trilogy shows some shades of this whenever Tact and Lester show their closeness. Particularly in Eternal Lovers, she gets excited when Tact hugs Lester out of relief after having a nightmare, much to Lester's annoyance.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Exiern_ apparently Peonie used to find Guy on Guy Hot until she imagined it involving her father.
-   _Ménage à 3_ uses this for its audience with Dillon and Matt as an early homosexual couple and more than enough random male homosexual couples making out. (Note that the comic ruthlessly avoids any hint of double standards; it provides guy-on-guy, girl-on-girl, and heterosexual fanservice.) Then there are the in-universe examples: Zii is quite obsessed with yaoi (though, to be fair, she does like bisexual and lesbian porn as well), and is sometimes distracted by those random gay couples on the street (it's Montreal — quite the boho city), while DiDi doesn't seem to dislike guy-on-guy action either. Straight guy Gary's occasional tendency to get distracted by the gay guys around him seems to be more of a mixture of naive curiosity and abstract aesthetics.
-   In _Questionable Content_, Marten admits that Steve, on a drunken dare, gave him a huge kiss, tongue and all. Dora and Faye's reaction? "RECREATE THIS. NOW."
-   This comic from _Scandinavia and the World_. A Yaoi surprise indeed.
-   _Shortpacked!_:
    -   In order to force Ethan to get together with a guy who previously called him out on his jerkish behavior, Robin adds a clause to the anti-cancer bill she's trying to get through Congress that will force the two to make out at least once a week. As soon as she does, the bill gains significant support among women.
    -   Amber repeatedly expresses enthusiasm for anything which results in two dudes getting it on.
-   In _Skin Horse_, Tip and Konstantin mud-wrestling attracts quite an audience, including a Kinsey-Seven<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  lesbian and a sapient swarm of bees.
-   _Sticky Dilly Buns_, a spin-off from _Ménage à 3_ (see above), features the naive, virginal Ruby, who is doomed to a rapid education in life, including, early on, exposure to the sight of two gay guys having sex. She subsequently suffers flashbacks to the scene and rapidly evolves into a Yaoi Fangirl (somewhat to her own confusion).
-   In _Our Little Adventure_, Angelika seems to have this opinion and elaborates on it here.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, this is one of the reasons Sarah is shipping Justin and Luke.
    
    **Sarah:** I _really_ want to see them make out.  
    _(Tedd and Grace stare at her)_  
    **Sarah:** ...Because it would make Justin happy. And stuff.
    
    -   Later Justin calls her on it:
    
    **Sarah:** Sooooooo, your date with Luke last night! How'd it go? How'd it go?  
    **Justin:** First, let me ask you something. Is part of your interest due to having a thing for male-male relationships, and being so eager to hear about them that you don't realize your own rudeness and insensitivity?  
    **Sarah:** _UH...._  
    **Justin:** Because I _love_ the attention and am eager to talk about all _sorts_ of stuff with you.  
    **Sarah:** Noted! Let's gab.
    
-   In _Ensign Sue Must Die_, even though Ensign Sue is torn between her love of Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock, she would be willing to compromise and get them to start a relationship with each other.
    
    **Sue:** The only thing better than making out with a hot guy is watching two hot guys make out!
    
-   _Black Hole (2019)_: In the "Bustin' Makes Me Feel Good" arc, Diana comes across a man possessed by a ghost that's making him come on to men despite the fact the man himself isn't actually gay. It's revealed that the ghost in question was an anime fangirl who died from "con plague" complications before she ever got to lose her virginity. She wanted to experience sex for the first time before moving on to the afterlife; this is the reason why she chose to posess a guy.
-   Played for laughs in _Record Wisdom Bonus Yield_. When explicitly told a monster is attacking Jaune and Cardin, Pyrrha uses everyone's low sense motive rolls to deliberately misinterpret what is going on and proclaim she wishes to congratulate the two on their new relationship. Ruby and Weiss hop in on the joke, declaring they'll protect Jaune during his makeout session. Jaune himself is not amused.

    Web Original 

-   _The Nostalgia Chick_:
    
    -   On the forums, when asked, Lindsay Ellis responded that she enjoys gay porn but can't stand it when it has a plot.
    -   In her review of _The Christmas Shoes_, the 12-year old version of herself is shown writing a Slash Fic featuring Legolas and Aragorn.
    -   In her review of _Kate & Leopold_, Leopold's "fresh, creamery butter" line causes The Nostalgia Critic, Todd in the Shadows, brentalfloss, and some other guy to start craving Hugh Jackman's butter and doing suggestive things with buttersticks. Lampshaded, of course.
    
    **Todd:** Why am I suddenly craving butter? …_man_ butter?  
    **Critic:** _\[strokes butterstick, then slaps self\]_ No! You like boobs! …and butter…
    
    -   And from her review of _Les Misérables_:
    
    **Javert:** _\[singing about Valjean\]_ He will bend, he will break…  
    **Lindsay:** _\[singing as Javert about Valjean\]_ He will bend over—_ooh!_
    
-   Invoked in episode 7 of _Sex House_ by the host, who tries to get Derek to have sex with Jay when both of them are intoxicated by the "cloudy drink".
-   _Dream Machine_: There is a lot of shipping slashed characters from the shows. And actors.

    Western Animation 

-   _Big Mouth_: Season 3's "Obsessed" sees this both as a plot and a gag. One of the episode's subplots follow Jay and Missy writing erotic slash fanfiction of the protagonist of Rock of Gibraltar and the protagonist of _Firefly_. In a throwaway gag, when Jessi says she won't watch Aiden and Matthew kissing while trying to arrange for them to have some time alone, Connie warns her not to "negotiate against herself".
-   In the _South Park_ episode "Tweek x Craig", P.C. Principal and Wendy host a student assembly that introduces the students to Yaoi. When the students are shown drawings of Craig and Tweek engaged in homoerotic activities (all of which, it should be noted, were real works of fan-art made by viewers of the show), all of the girls respond with, "Awww."
    -   This trope is averted hard in the episode "Cartman Sucks". When Cartman shows his class a picture of him sucking Butter's penis while he's asleep, the girls in the class react with as much revulsion as the boys. Then again, this is probably because it involves Cartman practically raping an unconscious boy.
