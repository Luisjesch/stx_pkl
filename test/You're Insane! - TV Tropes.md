**Sherlock:** You're insane!  
**Moriarty:** You're just getting that _now?_

A stock phrase typically spoken at the climax of a story.

The hero confronts the Big Bad, especially one they used to trust before their true colours were revealed about their actions. During the confrontation, the villain eagerly justifies the Evil Plan they've carried out with repugnantly twisted logic that is devoid of any trace of humanity or ethics and is often about to commit his supreme atrocity with a wild grin. The hero reacts with outrage at this depraved justification with "You're insane!" and instantly attacks to stop him.

Sometimes "mad", "crazy", "out of your mind", or "sick in the head" may be substituted for "insane", but the nature of the trope is the same.

Another heroic staple is this being one hero's response to another's proposal of a Zany Scheme — in which case the counterpoint is obviously, "Crazy Enough to Work!"

A villainous lunatic may well agree with you, perhaps with a snarky response like "You've only just now noticed?". A Mad Scientist will often retort that "They Called Me Mad!" Sometimes you can even say this to the villain when he's suffering a Villainous Breakdown. Some characters might throw back "I prefer the term..." followed by an adjective that they think best describes them. As a matter of fact, some Smug Snakes or even Magnificent Bastards can go so crazy during their breakdowns that other characters love hitting them with this. Sometimes the character will have indicated that he's considered the accusation against himself already, and deciding it really doesn't matter, often with an "Am I?" statement.

If a villain's henchman is giving the "You're Insane!" speech, it's often because what the villain is planning was not what he or she signed on for.

Contrast After-Action Villain Analysis for when the hero psychoanalyzes a villain after the fact.

See You Monster! for when a hero is outraged less at the sanity of the villain and more at the vileness of them, or This Is Unforgivable! when a hero is outraged at the terribleness of the villain's atrocities and how evil they've proven to be to the point of being Beyond Redemption.

-   _Hellsing_ has this, with a Catholic fundamentalist (who isn't much better himself) saying it to the Nazi Big Bad. His response? "If your God would allow my insanity to spread across the globe, then, wouldn't it seem you to that any God like that would be just as insane?"

-   In _Full Metal Panic!!_ (especially notable in the novels), Sousuke is shown to get incredibly confused as to _why_ Gauron acts the way he does. His bewilderment is shown to increase as Gauron's blood lust and incredibly gay flirting get more and more blaring and overt. And at the end of each time he wonders this, he repeatedly comes to this conclusion: Gauron is insane. There is no rational explanation for why he does what he does. And then he proceeds to beat the shit out of him.

-   _Future Diary_: Yukki to Yuno in chapter 54.

    **Zenigata:** WHAT?! Are you out of your mind!  
    **Lupin:** I thought you knew that!
    
-   From _Dragon Ball Z_ when Piccolo calls out Cell for absorbing many people before getting into Androids 17 and 18.
    
    **Piccolo:** What do you mean? It's not your power! You stole it by taking the lives of innocent people!

-   From _Baccano!_, Ladd Russo gets this from his uncle, after killing two of said uncle's men for no reason. Humorously, given the fact that Ladd does this stuff all the time and his uncle is also a criminal, it comes off less as a shocked reaction and more as an exasperated observation.
-   In the very first episode of _Zombie Land Saga_ Sakura lets out an "Are you stupid?!" to Kotaro's face. Given that he was putting six mindless zombies (and one fully aware zombie) onto the stage of a Death Metal concert as the first step toward making them idol singers, it's pretty clear she wasn't exactly questioning his _intelligence_...
-   Mine from _Akame ga Kill!_ tells Seryu this at the end of her "The Reason You Suck" Speech towards her, pointing out how Seryu claims to be a "servant of justice," but is in truth an Ax-Crazy sadist who delights in killing. Seryu, who has believed all her life that she's been doing the right thing, cannot work up a proper response to this and loses her shit... not that her anger saves her from Mine's much more potent rage, which literally gets Seryu blown in half.

    Audio Plays 

-   _Big Finish Doctor Who_: In _Tales from the Vault_, Steven calls Kali Korash 'psychotic'. Kali Korash takes this as a compliment.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   The Joker is not immune to this, or averse to employing Insult Backfire. For example, in _Batman_ #251, the Bronze Age comic that brought the Joker back to his psychopathic characterization, Batman and the Joker have this little exchange:
        
        **Batman:** Joker — you realize you're utterly... hopelessly... insane?  
        **Joker:** It's my most charming trait!
        
    -   Another example, from _Batman_ #321:
        
        **Robin:** You're out of your mind, Joker!  
        **Joker:** Gloriously so! Isn't it wonderful? If I were sane, I might not be so brilliant!
        
    -   And yet _another_ example:
        
        **Batman:** You're insane.  
        **Joker:** Has it really taken you this long to notice?
        
    -   One example not involving the Joker occurs in the Elseworld _Batman: Castle of the Bat_, where Bruce Wayne calls Dr. Seltsam insane for demonstrating a blatant disregard for human life by seeing no problem with getting people killed so he can preserve their body parts For Science!

-   _Iron Man:_ In _Fatal Frontier_, Iron Man says this to an Alternate Universe Doctor Doom after hearing the man describe his latest plan. Doom isn't fazed.
    
    **Doctor Doom:** I'd be insane if I couldn't achieve it. As it is, I am merely ambitious.
    
-   _Judge Dredd_:
    -   In "The Day the Law Died", the mad-as-a-nuthouse Chief Judge Cal is called out on being an insane dictator numerous times. He was liberal with the death sentence to anyone who brought this up.
    -   When the formerly-human Judge Death executed his own mother by hurling her off a cliff, she shrieked that he'd gone completely mad. When he carried out the deed, she changed her accusation to You Monster!.
-   _Nextwave_: This is used, but the Big Bad's logic doesn't even try to make sense.
-   _The Punisher_: The former page quote came from _The Punisher MAX_ where Wilson Fisk utters this to newly hired hitman Bullseye. More or less summing up his first impressions of him.
-   _Red Robin_: Tam Fox accuses Tim of being crazy after she's kidnapped by the League of Assassins and his infiltration of the group makes her think he's an assassin as well. He doesn't really correct her about his mental state but he does make it clear he's not a killer or on the League's side.
-   _Sin City_: In _A Dame to Kill For_ Dwight calls Ava insane after she reveals her having manipulated him into murdering her husband for her. Ava's retort sums up very well where this trope can fall flat.
    
    **Dwight:** You're insane!  
    **Ava:** Insane? HA! That's so easy, so convenient — and so wrong. Crazy people push shopping carts down the streets and talk nonsense. Crazy people sit in padded cells and soil their pants. A madwoman couldn't have pulled this off. No. There's a word for what I am, but nobody uses it anymore. Nobody wants to see the simple truth. If they did, they'd kill people like me as soon as we revealed ourselves. But they don't. They close their eyes and blather about psychology and say nobody is truly **evil.** That's why I've won. That's why I always win.
    
-   _Sonic the Comic_: Robotnik's right hand man Grimer says this to Robotnik after Chaos absorbs the Chaos Emeralds;
    
    **Robotnik:** I keep on telling you, Grimer, my faithful fool... I don't have a plan. This is the end for us all!  
    **Grimer:** You're... you're mad...  
    **Robotnik:** So what?

-   _Superman_: In _Krypton No More_, super-villain Radion gets this reaction from Superman when he explains his master plan: he wants to cause a meltdown in all the world's nuclear reactors because he thinks the resulting Armageddon will lead man to the next level of evolution. Many will die. Many will become twisted mutations, but some will become supermen. And he will rule them. Superman's reaction is understandable:
    
    **Superman:** Great Galaxies... the man's **INSANE!**
    
-   In _Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man_, when Doctor Octopus finally discovers Lex Luthor's real goal (destroying the world), he blurts out: "Dear Lord — he's mad!"
-   _The Tick_: In one issue, the art-themed villain the Impressionist is called crazy by his roommate. (At the time, the Impressionist was trying to eat a paint omelet.) Impressionist's retort?

-   _Transformers_:
    
    -   In _The Transformers: Drift Empire of Stone_, Ratchet says this to Hellbat during his Omnicidal Maniac\-flavored Motive Rant. Hellbat doesn't even blink.
    
    -   The _Transformers_ live-action movie follow-up comic _Reign of Starscream_ had this chilling exchange right before Starscream murders her:
    
    **Elita-One:** You're insane!  
    **Starscream:** No... I'm _in charge_.
    
-   _Ultimate Vision_: One of the scientists can't believe that Tarleton had fused the Gah Lak Tus tech into his own cyborg components. He asked for clarification: "insane" is hardly a scientific term.

-   _X-Men_:
    -   During his first clash with the team in _Uncanny X-Men_ #124, Arcade is told he's insane. His reply? "Crazy as a loon. Been that way for years."
    -   Towards the end of his solo run, after becoming somewhat... _strange_ and taking up the mantle of a mutant 'Shaman', Nate Grey gets this, word for word. His entirely unfazed response? "Probably."
    -   From a side-story to the _Avengers vs. X-Men_ crossover, in response to a Motive Rant:
        
        **Colossus:** You're insane.  
        **Magik:** Oh, thank you! Thank you! I knew eventually you'd understand.
        

    Comic Strips

-   In one _Peanuts_ storyline, Linus convinced Marcie to wait with him for the Great Pumpkin. But her parents came and got her and took her to be "deprogrammed". Which led to this interaction later:
    
    **Marcie:** They said you were a false prophet.  
    **Linus:** What else?  
    **Marcie:** That's it, nothing else.  
    **Linus:** What else?  
    **Marcie:** Well, they also said you were crazy...

-   _A Crooked Man_: Sinister calls out Johann this way:
    
    "You dare judge me?! You're insane! A lunatic with your power, you'll be a far greater threat to the world than I could ever be!

    -   Also spoofed in the related music video _Villain_, which is a spoof on the song _Hero_:

-   Socrates says this to Dr. Brainstorm in _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_, though in a more exasperated manner than shocked.

    -   A variation of this trope is said when Shendu and Valerie first meet following his supposed death and he comments that she seems well.
        
        **Valerie:** Considering I was kidnapped by an evil and insane demon, I think I'm recovering well.  
        **Shendu:** I may be spiteful and vindictive, but far from insane.
        
    -   Valerie says this again after Nataline Homato tries to kill her to deny Shendu his Other.

-   In the 11th chapter of _Loved and Lost_, Prince Jewelius reveals to the imprisoned heroes how evil he has been all along. Rarity ends up yelling this when the villain answers Fluttershy's question about why exactly he's making Twilight's friends suffer.
    
    **Fluttershy:** There's still one thing I don't understand. Why are you making the rest of _us_ suffer if it was the princesses you wanted gone?  
    **Jewelius:** It was nothing personal, really. Most of you were in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, there was "who would possibly want to do anything that could ruin such a glorious event like the wedding of the wonderful _Princess Mi Amore Cadenza_".

Vera replies that they're the only ones mad for not even trying to fight before she breaks free from her Samurai Khan escorts in a final attempt to attack Metalbeak.
    -   Vera is again on the receiving end of this during Chapter 31, not only from her ex-friends, but also Altaria and Maya when they learn that she initiated the Prison Riot just so she could assassinate Kage, without caring about risking the Shadow Realm declaring war on all of Meridian for the death of their queen.

Belle responds that the Beast isn't the one who's the monster - the real monster, as Belle points out, is none other than Gaston himself. Upon hearing that response, Gaston just snaps. His response?

    **Kirby:** You're insane!  
    **Radio:** Why, if only we were all wiener dogs, our problems would be solved!  
    _\[everyone turns to stare at him\]_

        **Batman:** He's psychotic.  
        **Vicki:** A lot of people say the same thing about you.  
        **Batman:** What people?  
        **Vicki:** I mean, let's face it. You're not exactly normal, are you?

    **Lex Luthor:** That is a three-syllable word for any thought too big for little minds.
    
-   In _Beauty and the Beast_, this is Belle's reaction to Beast asking her out for dinner _after_ locking her up in her father's place.
    
    **Belle:** You take me as your prisoner, and now you want to _have dinner with me? **Are you insane?**_
    
-   In _Bedazzled_, Stanley is initially skeptical that George is the Devil as he claims to be.
    
    **Stanley:** You're a nut case, you're a bleeding nut case!  
    **George:** They said the same of Jesus Christ, Freud, and Galileo.  
    **Stanley:** They said it of a lot of nut cases too!
    
-   John Woo's _Broken Arrow_ does it as well.
    
    **Hale:** You're out of your mind.  
    **Deakins:** Yeah. Ain't it cool?
    
-   _Cabin by the Lake_. When Stanley prepares to drown his two last victims, one of them calls him out as an insane maniac. He calmly responds that she's finally got it.
-   _Constantine_ says this to the Big Bad of the movie verbatim after hearing their plan.
    
    **Constantine:** _\[out of breath\]_ Gabriel... you're insane.
    
-   In the American dub of _Curse of the Golden Flower_, this line is said verbatim by the emperor to his youngest son who just stabbed the crown prince.
    
    **Prince:** Give the throne to me now! I want it all! He can rot in hell!  
    **Emperor:** You're insane!
    
-   _Cyberjack_: In the climax there's this back-and-forth between the villain and the female lead after he explains his plans to become a godlike techno-organic virus.
    
    **Alexandra:** You're insane!  
    **Nassim:** Perhaps. I choose to think of it as 'acute awareness'.
    
-   The Joker gets this again in _The Dark Knight_. This time his reply is a very firm "No. I'm _not_.", as this version of the Joker has a very clear and focused objective. Towards the end he more or less concedes that he might be crazy, but only as crazy as Batman himself. And Dent. And the army of lunatics he predicts will be joining them in the mad house.
-   In _Enchanted_, when Narissa in dragon form grabs Robert and takes him to the top of the tower — erm, Woolworth Building, he shouts, "You're crazy!"
    
    **Narissa:** No; spiteful, vindictive, very large, but NEVER crazy.
    
-   Inverted in _Fight Club_. The Narrator says this to Tyler Durden, who corrects him: "No, YOU'RE insane." It's pretty accurate, seeing as Tyler is the Narrator's split personality, and his physical presence in the movie is a hallucination.
-   _G.I. Joe: Retaliation_:
    -   The real president says this to Zartan. That's after he used a combat knife to slash his face, only for the nanomachines to heal it up. And for added bonus, Zartan has a "Yes, I am batshit insane" face afterwards, with him being a Smug Smiler to boot.
    -   Same stated by the world leaders during the nuclear arms summit when he launched all U.S.'s nuclear missiles at the other countries and resulting in them firing their missiles as well.
-   Mary's Berserk Button in _Hancock_ is being called crazy.
-   This exchange in _Hard Candy_:
    
    **Jeff:** You're Insane!  
    **Hayley:** Which I told you when we first met, remember? Four out of five doctors agree.
    
-   _Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom_: Indy is about the cut the rope bridge with everyone still on it. Just before, he told Short Round (in Chinese) to wrap his wrist with one of the ropes, with Short Round telling Willie that they're "going for a ride".
-   James Bond is fond of this, using cutting but accurate remarks to shut villains down and chew them out on their insanity whenever they rant about his flaws or their Evil Plan. Being Bond, he is witty enough to have a number of variations:
    -   _Dr. No_:
    -   _From Russia with Love_:
        
        **Bond:** _\[to Red Grant\]_ Tell me, which lunatic asylum did they get you out of?
        
    -   _Goldfinger_:
        
        **Bond:** Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.  
        **Pussy Galore:** Yes, I'm glad you're enjoying it.  
        **Bond:** Too bad it all has to end tomorrow morning. _\[turns and looks at her\]_ He's quite mad, you know.
        
    -   _Octopussy_: When Renegade Russian General Orlov discusses his plan to invade Western Europe to his bosses, General Gogol and the Politburo immediately call him out, knowing it'll trigger World War III and that Orlov is only doing it for the sake of personal gain.
    -   _GoldenEye_: Bond gives a Kirk Summation to Janus/Alec Trevelyan a.k.a. 006 on his plot to ruin the world, though 006 chews him out on his Failure Hero tendency to lose allies on missions, his Fatal Flaw for women<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and clinging on to outdated ideals.
    -   When Bond accuses media mogul Elliot Carver of insanity in _Tomorrow Never Dies_, he replies: "The distance between insanity, and genius, is measured only by success."
    -   _Spectre_: Using Psychological Projection, Franz Oberhauser/Ernst Stavro Blofeld claims that he and C are "visionaries", alongside giving a "Not So Different" Remark / Hannibal Lecture to 007. But Bond, aware that he and C are nothing more than insane loons, retorts that both of them are deranged, in an homage to Bond's quote to Dr. No regarding world domination. "Psychiatric wards are full of them."
    -   In the book _Moonraker_, Hugo Drax has Bond tied up at the base of his rocket to be incinerated during its launch. Bond takes the opportunity to recount Drax's life as he's gathered the info, in all its ugly, humiliating detail, to conclude how it's made him such a mental case. Bond's intent is to enrage Drax enough to overlook what Bond needs to escape.
    -   Woody Allen disavowed himself heavily from the 1967 _Casino Royale_, but this exchange with captive 007 (The Detainer played by Daliah Lavi) sure has his stamp:
        
        **007:** You're crazy — you're actually crazy!  
        **Jimmy Bond:** They called Einstein crazy!  
        **007:** That's not true; no-one ever called Einstein crazy!  
        **Jimmy Bond:** ... well, they would have if he'd carried on like this.
        
-   _Kingsman: The Secret Service_:
    -   The Swedish princess says this to Valentine when he first reveals his plans to her.
    -   Michelle to Roxy when she's told to lock her daughter in the bathroom and throw away the key.
-   Played with in _Law Abiding Citizen_. When the villain deliberately blows his chance at getting bail with a Motive Rant at the judge, the prosecutor asks him later if he's trying for an insanity plea.
-   In _Lawrence of Arabia_, when Lawrence suggests a rather foolhardy course of action, Ali's response is "you are mad!"
-   In _The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring_, Gandalf has a rather snappy reply to Saruman suggesting that they join Sauron:
    
    **Gandalf:** Tell me, _friend_... when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for _madness_?
    
-   In _The Mad Magician_, Lt. Bruce calls Gallico mad after Gallico tries to feed him into the crematorium. Gallico agrees, but says he would rather go to the electric chair than spend the rest of his life in a straitjacket in a padded cell in an insane asylum.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   A recurring exchange between Thor and Loki. In the beginning of _Thor_ Loki calls Thor's plan to venture into Jotunnheim madness. As Thor listens to Loki's Motive Rant at the end of the film, he says "This is madness!" and Loki retorts "Is it madness? Is it? IS IT??!".
    -   In _The Avengers_, Thor asks "Do you think this madness will end with your rule?!" and Loki answers that it is too late to stop the Alien Invasion he has caused.
    -   In _Thor: The Dark World,_ when Thor sees where Loki is heading the ship, he reacts with "_Are you mad?!_", and Loki replies "Possibly."
    -   After learning Thor's plan at the end of _Thor: Ragnarok_, Loki mutters to himself "This is madness."
    -   In _Iron Man 3_, Tony Stark says a variant of this to Aldrich Killian after he murders Maya Hansen just to put more misery on him.
        
        **Tony Stark:** You are a maniac...!  
        **Killian:** No, I'm a visionary. But I do own a maniac. And he takes the stage tonight.
        
    -   _Avengers: Age of Ultron_: When the Maximoffs realize that Ultron is less the Dark Messiah he presents himself as and more of an Omnicidal Maniac, Wanda calls him a madman.
    -   _Avengers: Infinity War_: Gamora says this to Thanos, when he tells her that he genuinely believes that he helped her planet by slaughtering half of its people.
-   MonsterVerse:
    -   _Godzilla_: A variation. When the military officers are seriously considering trying to kill Godzilla and the MUTOs by _dropping a nuke_ (which Godzilla survived decades ago with no lasting damage and which will produce radioactive fallout that the kaiju can ''feast'' on), a horrified Dr. Graham says, "This is crazy!"
    -   _Godzilla: King of the Monsters_: After hearing the extensive Motive Rant of Emma Russell, his own ex-wife, revealing she was in cahoots with Alan Jonah and that they intend to set all the Titans loose indiscriminately to bring Gaia's Vengeance and Utopia Justifies the Means, an outraged Mark Russell tells her she's insane, then he directly calls her out for both putting their daughter in danger and thinking she has the right to decide by herself the fate of the world.
-   In the documentary _My Best Fiend_, director Werner Herzog recalls one incident with actor Klaus Kinski:
    
    **Kinski:** You've become a megalomaniac!  
    **Herzog:** Then now there are two of us.
    
-   This is Ivan's response when Joe tells him about the fire insurance fraud in _Mystery of the Wax Museum_.
-   Clive Barker's _Nightbreed_: When the psychotic Dr. Decker explains to an old man whom he's torturing for information that he believes it is his mission to wipe out the Nightbreed, the man calls him crazy. Decker's retort: "No, I'm Death, plain and simple".
-   Gleefully defied by one of the zombified stockboys in the 1984 film _Night of the Comet_:
    
    **Regina:** You're _crazy_!  
    **Eddie the Comet Zombie:** I'm not crazy — _I just don't give a fuck!_
    
-   Captain Jack Sparrow in the _Pirates of the Caribbean_ films gets this a lot.
    -   One time was when he attempts to escape from Lord Beckett's ship in _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End_ by blasting its mast down with a cannon and riding its rigging back to the _Black Pearl_. When Beckett sees this, he tells Jack _"You're mad."_ To which Jack replies "Thank goodness for that, because if I wasn't, this would probably never work." In classic Sparrow fashion, it _does_ work... and as revealed moments later, it worked without a drop of rum in his system.
    -   His madness is not always considered a bad thing, as seen in this exchange between Anamaria and Gibbs in _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl_ after Gibbs and Elizabeth have agreed on an unconventional battle plan:
        
        **Anamaria:** You're daft, lady! You both are!  
        **Gibbs:** Aye, daft like Jack.
        
-   In _Scanners II: The New Order_, David dismisses Peter Drak's claims about Forrester's evil plans with this retort.
-   In _Scream_, after Sidney finds out that her boyfriend Billy and his friend Stu are the killers.
-   _Sherlock Holmes_ pulls a somewhat more subtle version when Sherlock Holmes meets the Serial Killer Big Bad Lord Blackwood.
    
    **Blackwood:** Those lives were a necessity. Sacrifice. Five otherwise meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose.  
    **Holmes:** I wonder if they'd let Watson and me dissect your brain. After you're hanged, of course. I'd wager there's some deformity that'd be scientifically significant.
    
-   In the movie _Sneakers_, Cosmo explains his plan to crash the entire world's monetary record-keeping systems to his old friend Martin. Bemused, Martin asks him, "You haven't gone crazy on me, have you?" Cosmo smiles: "Who else is gonna save the world, Marty? Greenpeace?" Disappointed and somewhat spooked, Martin concludes, "You _are_ crazy." (This turns out to be the Wrong Thing to say.)
-   _Speed_ has a pretty good comeback to this, after the villain gets his hands on the million dollar ransom.
    
    **Jack:** You're crazy. You're fucking crazy!  
    **Payne:** No! _Poor_ people are crazy, Jack! I'm _eccentric_!
    
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   In _Star Trek V: The Final Frontier_, Kirk tells the ostensible villain, Sybok: "You are mad." Sybok looks genuinely uncertain when he replies "Am I?"
    -   In _Star Trek: First Contact_, Data tells the Borg Queen "To believe oneself to be perfect is often the sign of a delusional mind."
-   _Street Fighter_: This is M. Bison's Berserk Button. Twice, other people make the mistake of openly questioning his sanity, but for different reasons, Bison can't afford to kill either of them (in Dhalsim's case, he is still needed alive to finish the Blanka project, while Sagat has too many of his own lackeys with him).
-   Lampshaded a bit in _Superman Returns_:
    
    **Lex Luthor:** C'mon, let me hear you say it, just once.  
    **Lois Lane:** You're insane.  
    **Luthor:** NO! Haha, no, not that, the _other_ thing.  
    **Lois:** Superman will never—  
    **Luthor:** WRONG!!!
    
-   Spoken by the Final Girl to the family in _The Texas Chainsaw Massacre_.
-   _The Wicker Man_:
    
    **May Morrison:** Can I do anything for you, Sergeant?  
    **Sgt. Neil Howie:** No, I doubt it, seeing as you're all _raving_ mad!
    
-   _The Wolverine_: Mariko to her father when he's about to kill her.

-   Dashiell Hammett's _The Dain Curse_ concludes with one of the most effective "You're insane"s in literature.
-   _The Devils Of D-Day_ by Graham Masterton. The protagonist responds this way when offered a Deal with the Devil. The demon making the offer just laughs. "Insanity is a human word which almost always describes the activities of devils."
-   "You Don't Have to Be Mad...", a short story from the _Diogenes Club_ series by Kim Newman. Psychic detective Richard Jeperson investigates a clinic run by Dr. I. M. Ballance which is turning people into functioning psychopaths (some of whom are implied to be infamous politicians and entrepreneurs of The '80s). Dr. Ballance gives a Motive Rant over how Britain has always used mad people to achieve greatness, and how one day his madness will spread across the world.
    
    "I suppose it would be redundant to call _you_ mad?" Richard ventured.  
    Dr. Ballance giggled.
    
-   In _The Dresden Files_ novel _Dead Beat_ Dresden calls Cowl insane after learning of his plan to become a dark god.

-   _Mistborn_:
    -   A wonderful example as Breeze finally realizes that Kelsier didn't in fact bribe Lord Renaux, but instead simply had him killed and replaced with a kandra.
        
        **Breeze:** You genius! You bloody insane genius! You had him killed, didn't you?  
        **Kelsier:** Both compliments are appreciated, and yes.
        
    -   Everybody is _constantly_ calling Kelsier insane. His plans are generally Crazy Enough to Work. Another great example: quoth Yeden, "You're going to visit the Lord Ruler? Are you insa... right. I forgot."

    -   In _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_, Harry comes out of the maze and Mad-Eye Moody who was actually Barty Crouch Jr, who up until then Harry had respected and sought advice from, drags Harry off to his office so he can gleefully tell him how he had orchestrated the entire scheme and would now have the honor of killing Harry for Voldemort. Harry sums this up by telling him that he's crazy.
    -   A more mild example in _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_ when Hermione says, _"'Are - you - insane?'"_ in response to hearing that Harry's half-thought out plan for talking to Sirius involves breaking into Umbridge's office to use her fireplace.
-   In _The Fountainhead_, Ellsworth Toohey beats his victim to the punch:
    
    **Keating:** Ellsworth... you're...  
    **Toohey:** Insane? Afraid to say it? There you sit and the word's written all over you, your last hope. Insane? Look around you. Pick up any newspaper and read the headlines. Isn't it coming? Isn't it here? Every single thing I told you?

-   In _The Picture of Dorian Gray_, Alan Campbell calls Dorian Gray mad after having been asked by Dorian to help dispose of Basil Hallward's body.

    **Hannibal Lecter:** What disadvantages?  
    **Will Graham:** You're insane.
    
-   _Shadow of the Conqueror_:
    -   Sain is completely unprepared for how intense things get between the main characters when he overhears a conversation about whether Daylen will Turn Out Like His Father.
        
        **Daylen:** Trust me, if I do, I'll kill myself.  
        **Ahrek:** No, Daylen, if you truly become anything like your father, _I_ will kill you.  
        _\[beat\]_  
        **Daylen:** Thank you. You're a better friend than I thought.  
        **Ahrek:** You're more than welcome.

    -   Mace Windu, is often called insane by his allies, no less. Finally he snaps and delivers a paragraph-long speech, saying that others call him insane so they don't have to face up to their own immorality.
    -   More amusingly Nick, after exclaiming such whenever Windu proposes or does something that seems insane/crazy eventually just tells him to assume he's said it whenever he (Windu) says anything'
-   _Villainess Level 99_: Pretty much everyone's reaction when Yumiella tells them what she did to get her level so high. This includes hunting monsters in the forest as a preteen, going alone into dungeons meant for parties, wearing magic equipment that boosts experience gains rather than offering any protection, and using a monster-summoning flute over and over to kill the summoned monsters for experience. She, not understanding the norms of society, doesn't realize why they are shocked.
-   In _Warrior Cats_, Crookedstar calls Mapleshade insane after she explains how she tried to get revenge on him, while pretending to be his mentor, all along.

        **Oliver:** Reiter, you're insane!  
        **Baron Reiter:** The difference between insanity and belief lies only in the number of believers.
        
    -   In the next episode Oliver gives the trope again and Reiter responds thus:
    -   Averted in "Monument Point" when Thea discovers her supervillain father Malcolm Merlyn is planning to destroy the world.

-   _Babylon 5_ has several examples.
    -   One notable between Londo and G'kar.
        
        **Londo:** You're _insane_!  
        **G'kar:** And _that_ is why we'll win.
        
    -   Played with when Londo accepts a Duel to the Death challenge, despite being (at that point in the series) more known for his hedonism than physical courage.
        
        **Vir Cotto:** Londo, this is insane!  
        **Londo Mollari:** Insanity is part of the times! You must learn to embrace the madness. Let it fire you.
        
    -   Londo's final confrontation with Mr. Morden:
        
        **Morden:** You're insane.

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   It's said to an invisible girl in "Out of Mind, Out of Sight":
        
        **Buffy:** There's one thing I didn't factor into all of this. You're a raving loony!
        
    -   From "Older and Far Away"
        
        **Buffy:** I was insane to ever think you could just hang out with my friends.

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "The Tomb of the Cybermen": The Second Doctor has faked out Klieg and gotten him to blab the entire plan.

    -   "The Mutants": The Doctor gives this trope to the Marshal of Solos, who retorts, "Only if I lose."

    -   "Genesis of the Daleks": Davros reacts thus to being outvoted:
        
        **Davros:** Do you believe that I would let a lifetime's work be ended by the will of spineless fools like you? You have won nothing! I allowed this charade to be played out for one reason only: To find those men who were truly loyal to me and to discover those WHO WOULD BE-TRAY ME! WE— I! WILL! GO! ON!  
        **Gharman:** You are _insane_, Davros!
        
    -   "The Brain of Morbius": As Mehendri Solon is about to begin his gruesome experiment, Sarah Jane cries, "You're insane, Solon, you're mad!" Adding even more Awesomeness, this trope is then followed by a They Called Me Mad! rant from this Mad Scientist, all in his Mad Scientist Laboratory.
    -   "The Mark of the Rani" has this rather hilarious understatement:
        
        **The Master:** You underestimate me. Certainly I want to destroy him, see him suffer, but that is just an exquisite first step. I have a greater concept, one that will encompass the whole human race!  
        **The Rani:** You're unbalanced. No wonder the Doctor always outwits you.
        
    -   The Doctor gets this a few times themself. In "The Greatest Show in the Galaxy", when Ace accuses the Seventh Doctor of being mad, he answers, "Anybody remotely interesting is mad, in some way or another."
    -   "Smith and Jones": The Doctor absorbs a lethal dose of radiation and then expels it through his foot. This results in him doing a one-legged dance across the room, complaining about how much it itches, before binning his shoe — all while Martha watches.
        
        **Martha:** You're _completely_ mad.  
        **The Doctor:** You're right. I look daft with one shoe. _\[bins the other one\]_ Barefoot on the Moon!
        
    -   "The Sound of Drums": The Prime Minister (actually The Master) kills the entire Cabinet by flooding the room with gas; as they fall down and die, one gasps "You're insane!" and he responds with a grin and a dual thumbs-up.
    -   "The Eleventh Hour": This dialogue between the Doctor and Amy Pond sets the tone for their future relationship:
        
        **Amy Pond:** I thought... well, I started to think you were just a madman with a box.  
        **The Doctor:** Amy Pond, there's something you better understand about me 'cause it's important and one day your life may depend on it... I am definitely a madman with a box.
        
    -   "The Lodger" plays it for laughs again: Craig, already weirded out by his new housemate's behaviour, is left completely stumped when, having been sick all morning, he finds the Doctor filling in for him at work.
        
        **The Doctor:** Had some time to kill, I was curious. Never worked in an office; never worked in anywhere!  
        **Craig:** You're _insane_.
        
    -   "The Crimson Horror": "I'm the Doctor, _you're nuts_, and I'm going to stop you."
    -   "The Return of Doctor Mysterio": After two thousand years of adventuring, the Doctor points out that it's hardly an original observation.
        
        **Nardole:** You are completely out of your mind!  
        **The Doctor:** How is that news to anyone?!
        
-   _Dollhouse_:
    -   When Boyd (who is actually the head of Rossum) reveals his grand plan to protect only the privileged few from mindwiped slavery and tells his now ex-allies their only choice is "to be the destroyed or the destroyers":
        
        **Adelle:** You are _spectacularly_ insane.
        
    -   A more low-key version in "Echoes":
        
        **Echo:** You're insane.  
        **Sam:** Nobody's perfect.
        
-   _Farscape_:
    -   As protagonist John Crichton became increasingly unhinged, it was more typical for the _villains_ to question the sanity of the _heroes_. Often with good reason. This is perhaps most memorably demonstrated in _The Peacekeeper Wars_ with this exchange:
        
        **Scorpius:** This is insane, Crichton.  
        **Crichton:** God! Four years on and you're finally getting that.
        
    -   Another variation is used earlier. One of the bad guys says to Aeryn "He's _crazy_!" She replies adoringly "Isn't it fun?" Also, when he plays chicken with a nuclear bomb Ahkna uses the line verbatim, and Aeryn concurs.
-   From _Firefly_:
    
    **Simon:** You're out of your mind.  
    **Early:** That's between me and my mind.
    
    -   Simon says Mal is psychotic after he rather nastily pranks him by saying Kaylee died after she was shot.
    -   Wash says to Zoe that Mal is insane when they’re tortured by Niska and Mal won’t break. She thinks he means Niska at first but then he talks about Mal saving Zoe in the war and she realizes he means Mal.
-   _The Flash_. What Barry Allen says to Nicolas Pike after he's seen what his nemesis has done to Central City during his ten-year absence through accidental time travel.
-   _Forever_: Henry to his stalker multiple times. Also Nora to Henry when he tells her about his immortality.
-   _Get Smart_: In "Shock It To Me", Smart and Agent 99 are captives of Mad Scientist Dr. Zharko:
    
    **99:** You're mad!  
    **Zharko:** Mad, am I??? MAAAD AM I??? MWAHAHAHAAA!!!  
    **99:** _\[anxiously\]_ Don't _do_ that!  
    **Zharko:** _\[utterly straightfaced\]_ Don't do what?
    
-   _The Goodies_:
    -   When Tim tells the villainous Music Master he's a raving loony, the Music Master simply responds "Thank you".
    -   And when Graham Garden tries to use a rowboat to tow Britain outside the three-mile limit so he can rule it as a pirate state.
        
        **Bill:** You've gone absolutely mad! You're a megalomaniac!  
        **Graeme:** I'm not!  
        **Bill and Tim:** _\[sing-songy\]_ _You're a mega~lo~man~i~ac! You're a mega~lo~man~i~ac!_  
        **Graeme:** _\[jumping up and down\]_ I'M NOT, I'M NOT, I'M NOT! _\[boat starts to sink\]_
        
    -   And in "The Goodies and the Beanstalk" when Graham comes up with yet another idea that's Crazy Enough to Work.
        
        **Graham:** Now you might say I'm a loony...  
        **Bill and Tim:** You're a loony!
        
-   In _Gotham_ Jim uses this no less than three times, on three different enemies and phrases it in a different way each time. The most original one was addressed to Dr. Strange who was notably annoyed by the remark.
    
    **Jim:** You belong in your own asylum, Strange!  
    **Strange:** And you, Jim Gordon, belong in the past.
    
-   Sylar gets this a lot on _Heroes_, what with the whole brain-stealing supervillain thing he's got going. He usually just brushes it off without responding directly to the accusation.
-   _House of Anubis_:
    -   In the Season 1 finale:
        
        **Jason:** You're insane...  
        **Rufus:** Very Observant.
        
    -   Also, earlier in the season, there was this exchange, after Rufus kidnapped Patricia.
        
        **Mr. Sweet:** What? Have you gone mad?  
        **Rufus:** Yes, quite possibly.
        
-   In _John Adams_, Alexander Hamiltons suggests to Adams, at the time President of the United States, in the name of "universal empire", to invade Central America in case of France winning the Napoleonic War. Adams reaction is less than enthusiastic.
    
    **Adams** May I inform you as well, Sir, that I am in possession of intelligence which confirms that we are as likely to find a French army on these shores, as we are on the moon! You dream of "empire", Mr. Hamilton?  
    **Hamilton** You question my loyalty, Sir?  
    **Adams** Oh no, Mr. Hamilton, I question your _sanity_! Now either you are stark raving mad, _OR I AM_! Good day, Sir!
    
-   _Kamen Rider Gotchard_: Rinne Kudo is going to stop all Chemies from running rampant. So she decides to face off Steamliner. The Chemy that's basically _a sentient steam train_. Hotaro of all people tells her that she's nuts.
-   _Averted_ in the _Law & Order: Criminal Intent_ episode "Gemini", where the perp manipulated his schizophrenic brother into murdering people. Goren tends to have a more nuanced perspective on the mentally ill in general, likely in large part because of his mother's schizophrenia. The final interrogation includes this memorable exchange:
    
    **Spencer Anderson:** None of this is true. You said so yourself. He's crazy.  
    **Detective Goren:** Yeah, he may be crazy, but you're _evil_.
    
-   Jack has said this to Locke a bunch of times on _Lost_, usually when Locke is talking about things like moving the island, or how Taller Ghost Walt told him to kill Naomi.

-   _M\*A\*S\*H_:
    -   In the season three opening episode, "The General Flipped at Dawn", after overruling the orders of the crazy General Steele to make a helicopter perform a pointless task instead of ferrying a critically wounded patient to Seoul, Hawkeye responds to being called insolent and insubordinate by agreeing and then telling the general, "And you're _nuts_!"
    -   In "The Light That Failed", the characters argue over who committed the murder in a mystery novel with the last page missing. They're no wiser by the end of the episode, so Hawkeye confesses to the murders. When BJ responds with this trope, he pretends to go Laughing Mad and hauls off a willing nurse to have his wicked way with her.
-   A very low-key one occurs in _Once Upon a Time_.
    
    **Zelena:** You're insane.  
    **Rumpelstiltskin:** _\[dismissively\]_ Beside the point.
    
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_, Season 2: In "Green No More", Goldar has forced the de-powered Tommy to kneel, demanding that Tommy acknowledge him as his superior, leading to the following: <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Tommy gets a subtler one in _Power Rangers: Dino Thunder_ (with a little You Monster! thrown in) when Mesogog tells him of his master plan to **turn the entire human population into dinosaurs**:
        
        **Tommy:** Why can't you just want to rule the Earth like all the other sickos?
        
    -   Hunter in _Power Rangers Ninja Storm_, when Motodrone (a robotic "perfect rider" built by a perfectly ordinary Muggle) announces he's going to finish his perfect bike by adding Hunter's life energy to it. Motodrone's response is "Yes, but that's the fun of it." Talk about A.I. Is a Crapshoot...
-   In a parody of _The McLaughlin Group_ on _Saturday Night Live_, one of the panel members, annoyed by McLaughlin's continued interruptions and overly long nicknames, invoked this trope. McLaughlin just responded with another "WRONG!"
-   In one episode of _Seinfeld_, Kramer meets Jerry's Girl of the Week and after hearing her voice is completely convinced that she is the same phone sex operator that he often calls. At the end of the episode he is proven right.
    
    **Jerry:** Aww, you're crazy.  
    **Kramer:** _Am_ I?! Or am I _so sane_ that you just _blew your mind_?!  
    **Jerry:** It's impossible!  
    **Kramer:** _Is_ it?! Or is it _so possible_ that your head is _spinning like a top_?!  
    **Jerry:** It can't be!  
    **Kramer:** _Can_ it?! Or is your _entire world_ just _crashing down all around you_?!  
    **Jerry:** All right, that's enough.  
    **Kramer:** _**YEEAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH**_!!
    
-   _Sherlock_

        **Moriarty:** You're just getting that _now_?
        
    -   Again in "The Sign of Three":
        
        **David:** They were right about you. You're a... bloody psychopath!  
        **Sherlock:** High-functioning sociopath... _with_ your number!
        
-   _Stargate Atlantis_:
    -   This is Ronon's response in "Reunion", after a few of his old friends from Sateda relate their story of how they became Wraith worshippers.

-   _Star Trek_:
    -   _Star Trek: The Original Series_: A variant is used in the episode "What Are Little Girls Made of?", where a scientist tries to convince Capt. Kirk to participate in a twisted scheme to take over a planet of the Federation.
        
        **Kirk:** You've convinced me; you've convinced me that you're dangerous!
        
    -   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
        -   Spoken by Kira in the episode "Duet" when a Cardassian war criminal starts gleefully boasting about his horrific crimes. Only he's invoked the trope; he's intentionally behaving over-the-top in the hopes of forcing the Cardassian atrocities into the open. He isn't even the actual criminal; he's a file clerk who is impersonating the real criminal, with the intent of being _executed_ for the man's crimes, because of his own traumatic memories of witnessing what happened and his guilt at being unable to stop it.
        -   Played for Laughs in "Ties of Blood and Water" when Weyoun 5 drinks a shot of poisoned kanar just to demonstrate how Vorta can't be killed with poison.
            
            **Weyoun:** _\[shudders\]_ Oh my. That is _quite_ toxic, isn't it?  
            **Dukat:** Are you _insane_?
            
        -   And in "Tears of the Prophets", Weyoun gives the trope to Dukat.
            
            **Weyoun:** You're right, Dukat, you have changed. You've gone from being a self-important egoist to a self-deluded madman. I hardly call that an improvement.
            
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_: Said verbatim by Harry Kim in "The Chute" when he and Tom Paris are in a Hellhole Prison where all prisoners are implanted with a synaptic stimulator that increasingly impairs their mental function. Kim befriends an inmate who appears to be the Only Sane Man among the prison population, but it's not long before the man's true colors start showing: while he's not violent the way the other prisoners are, he's a whole other kind of crazy.
        
        **Inmate:** You've got a chance to make something of your life in here, but as long as that carcass \[a badly injured Tom Paris\] is in my hut, we'll never be able to go on to more important things.  
        **Kim:** What the hell are you talking about?  
        **Inmate:** We've got to disseminate the manifesto. Gather our followers. Train them.  
        **Kim:** You're insane.
        
    -   _Star Trek: Discovery_: Used in the episode "Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad".

    -   _Star Trek: Picard_:
        -   In "Maps and Legends", when Laris learns of Picard's plans to get Back in the Saddle, she wonders if he has dementia.
            
            **Laris:** What?! Have you gone mad? Is it dementia?  
            **Picard:** I beg your pardon?  
            **Laris:** Sorry, but you're not a stupid man, so when I hear you say such a stupid idea, I have to ask for other explanations.
            
        -   In "Absolute Candor", Raffi questions Picard's sanity after she finds out that he ordered Rios to change course for Vashti.
            
            **Raffi:** You wanna go to Vashti?! Are you out of your goddamn mind?! \[...\] That you even suggest it makes me seriously question your mental state.
            
        -   In "Nepenthe", it's lampshaded by Rios, who believes Elnor is out of his mind for staying on the Artifact, which is crawling with Tal Shiar (the Arch-Enemy of the Qowat Milat), instead of transporting back to _La Sirena_.
            
            **Rios:** Everyone here thinks you're _crazy_.
            
-   In another example of people saying this to the protagonist(s), this is a common response to _Supernatural_'s Dean and Sam when they tell people about the ghosts, vampires, zombies, and demons they hunt. Dean often offers a casual acknowledgement:
    
    **Bobby:** You are nine kinds of crazy, boy.  
    **Dean:** It's been said.
    
-   Bartlet says this to his wife in the fourth season opener of _The West Wing_ after she cuts off his tie just before he walks into a presidential debate. Considering he'd been kvetching about how he wouldn't win without his lucky tie, she may have helped him win the debate, as the mad panic that ensued made Bartlet grab Josh's tie, which is very similar to how he ended up getting his first lucky tie.
-   In _Who, Sir? Me, Sir?_, one of the kids, taken aback by their ringleader's latest Zany Scheme, protests "You're mad!" She merely invites him to consider why her nickname is "Nutty".
-   Except in early seasons, this exchange happens Once an Episode in _Win Ben Stein's Money_, after he has explained the premise of putting his money on the line:
    
    **Ben:** Now, why would I do this? Well, call me crazy.  
    **Audience:** You're crazy!
    
-   On _Yellowjackets_, Misty Quigley's biggest secret is that she sabotaged the emergency transmitter that might have allowed the Yellowjackets to be rescued from being stranded in the wilderness. Throughout the second season, Misty develops a friendship with a fellow survivor named Crystal. Finally, on the fifth episode of said season, after exchanging silly secrets, she eventually decides to reveal to Crystal that she sabotaged the transmitter. Instead of whatever reaction she expected, a disgusted Crystal tells her "You're a psycho."

-   _Assassins_:

    **Oswald:** You're nuts.  
    **Booth:** Maybe I am. So what?
    
-   Noah Smith's stage version of _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_:
    
    **Utterson:** Hyde, you're mad, you're—  
    **Hyde:** _Am_ I mad? Making love to those I love, and killing those I hate—is that madness, or is that just doing away with the formalities?
    
-   In _Lizard Boy_ after Siren tells Trevor that he needs to help her defeat the dragons:

    **Hahli:** You're insane!

    Video Games 

-   _AdventureQuest Worlds_:
    -   In the final cutscene of the "Giant Tale" questline, Andre the Giant thinks that everything the hero did up to the point of claiming the key from his Giant Necklace is insane (he even thinks the hero poisoned his giant son Andre Jr.), but the hero and Crychek tell him not to worry as his son is fine and just taking a nap in his soup.
        
        **Hero:** Next time, pick on somebody your own size, Andre.  
        **Andre:** Pick on someb— THIS IS INSANE! I'm just farming, trying to grow enough food for my family... then you tiny people show up, start infesting my yard, beat up my cat and then you **POISON MY SON!!!**  
        **Hero:** Relax, your son is fine. He's just taking a nap.  
        **Crychek:** ...In yer soup.
        
    -   Also, there's that moment in Nythera's wedding event where Ryuuji says this to Nythera because when she says that the third and final challenge for the Test of the Suitor was to defeat a Void Giant she magically awakened and summoned to the Void Temple, Ryuuji realizes that the Void Giant is out of control and therefore needs to be stopped before it destroys the temple.
        
        **Ryuuji:** A VOID GIANT?! Are you **INSANE?!** We have to stop it before it destroys the temple!  
        **Nythera:** You mean **I** have to stop it.  
        **Ryuuji:** No, Nythera. **WE** have to stop. Neither of us can do this alone.

    **Riddler:** _\[calmy and thoughtfully, as if he has been given this a lot of thought\]_ ...no, I don't think that's it.
    
-   _Batman: Vengeance_ is one example where it's not said to a villain:

    **Batgirl:** No way. That's insane.  
    **Batman:** Joker's insane, but not stupid.
    
-   During the Ascent in _The Binding of Isaac: Repentance_, it's revealed that one of the contributing factors of Isaac's mother and father's relationship falling apart is Isaac's mom's increasing religious fanaticism, which his father calls out in no uncertain terms (since Isaac, who she's ranting at, is _four to five years old_).
    
    **Mom:** You need to repent. You need to confess your sins, and become saved! Let His light inside you! CLEANSE YOUR SOUL!  
    **Dad:** You. Are. Insane. You are taking this too far! Can't you hear how you sound?  
    **Mom:** Pray with me! Pray for your salvation! Come, pray with us, Isaac...
    
-   _BlazBlue_:
    -   Ragna the Bloodedge says such a phrase to Rachel in her _Continuum Shift_ Gag Reel when Luna begins coming to love him due to the effects of the Spectacles of Eros and Rachel admits that Ragna is head-over-heels in love with her.
        
        **Ragna:** You twisted, evil, blood-sucking rabbit! What the hell do you think you're doing?!  
        **Rachel:** Oh come now, Ragna! No need to be shy. Just admit your feelings... Admit that you are my devoted servant!  
        **Ragna:** Who are you calling a servant?!
        
    -   He does the same thing to her, Nu, and Tager after they allow Jin and the rest of the H.M.S. Nirvana crew to take him leaving the three of his fellow U.S.S. Ragna crew members to enjoy their Ikaruga Tuna without him in - you guessed it - his own gag ending.

    -   During _Slight Hope_, Makoto questions Hazama's sanity when the former tried to kill Jin in front of her. His answer cements her suspicions that he was never trustworthy on top of cuing an armed response from her.
        
        **Makoto:** Have you lost your mind?! Why are you attacking him?  
        **Hazama:** To kill him! Duh! Did you need to ask that, or were you being rhetorical and melodramatic?  
        **Jin:** Get out of here, Makoto! I'm the one he's after!  
        **Makoto:** The hell I will! You know, Hazama, I always figured there was something suspicious about you... I'm dedicating my first punch to women's intuition!

        **Leliana:** You think I left because of you? You think I still have some plan for... for revenge? You are insane! Paranoid!
        
    -   Used in reference to the _player character_ near the beginning of the game, if you chose to kill the Almost Dead Guy yourself.
    -   Used by Morrigan when Leliana threatens to take her shopping.

    **Tidus:** You're totally nuts!
    
-   In _Final Fantasy XIV_, H'naanza gawps at how Merlwyb tests Blanstyr and the Warrior of Light's armor in the Level 50 Armorer quest: by putting it through rigorous tests including having the test subjects wearing the armor beaten down with axes and shot at.
    
    **Merlwyb:** Well, well, it appears your claims to excellence are more than empty boasts. Let's raise the stakes, shall we? _\[shoots the men wearing the armor\]_  
    **H'naanza:** Admiral! You go too far!  
    **Merlwyb:** Such expensive equipment is of little use to us if it cannot stop a bullet.
    
-   Said to Sephiran near the end of _Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn_ when it becomes apparent he engineered two world wars for the sake of eradicating mankind.
-   In _Fire Emblem: Awakening_, this is said in Brady's B support with Female Morgan if they're siblings, when she wants her sibling to use the tome and yell at her to try to shake some memories loose (to which the sibling normally says, "Good night Morgan.").
    
    **Brady:** You're insane! I'm outta here.
    
-   _Hatred_'s Villain Protagonist gets one directed at him when he gets to the control room of the nuclear power plant at the end of the game.
    
    **Not Important:** How do I overload the reactors?  
    **Technician:** What?! No! Never! It'll cause a massive explosion! Are you insane?!
    
-   In _La Pucelle Tactics_, the Big Bad Noir seems sympathetic because of his tragic backstory and frequent statements about creating a Utopia. At the end of the game, the main character (as well as the player) finally discover exactly what his Utopia consists of: a world that is without suffering because there's nobody left alive to suffer. Cue the relevant Stock Phrase.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_: Zelda says this to Ganondorf shortly after he goes Laughing Mad at the wish the king gives to the Triforce:

        **Lawyer:** You're _insane!_  
        **Shepard:** Our suits have kinetic barriers. Your legal briefs don't. And _I'm in a hurry_
        
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   Zero says this flat out to Redips in _Mega Man X: Command Mission_. X also hits him with a You Monster!: "You... You... Maverick!"
        
        **Zero:** Epsilon's ideas were dangerous. He knew all along that use of Supra-Force Metal involved the possibility of becoming Maverick. But at least he... was better than you. At least he wasn't a Maverick from the start. Redips, you're crazy!
        
    -   _Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X_:
        -   "You think you have potential? You're insane, Sigma!"
        -   In the opening flashback cutscene for Vile mode in the same game, _Vile_ actually says this phrase to Sigma when Sigma mentions that he plans on going Maverick to draw out X's power, and this is coming from a character who is quite a Sociopathic Soldier.
    -   X calls out Sigma again in _Mega Man X5_ after Sigma talks about awakening Zero using the Maverick Virus.

    -   X to Copy Sigma in _Mega Man X8_: "You plan to take revenge on every Reploid... Every human... In the entire world? You're completely mad! I'm putting a stop to this right now!"
-   _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_:
    -   Miller, while Coldman is bragging about activating Peace Walker, leaking the false data to NORAD, and declaring retaliation to be inevitable, declares him to be such:
        
        **Miller:** Are you insane?! Do you think this will end here?! You're about to unleash all-out nuclear war!
        
    -   Huey also indirectly asks if Coldman is out of his mind when he realizes that Coldman is intending to launch Peace Walker's nuke into the Carribbean Sea \[specifically at Mother Base\] so that the nuclear fallout will travel through the trade winds and poison Central America's fish and crop market, allowing for "free hands" by forcing the natives to participate in Peace Walker's mass production.
    -   Snake also exclaims that Paz, who has stolen Metal Gear Zeke, is insane when he learns that they intend to launch a nuke at the East Coast.
-   _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_:
    -   Raiden states this to Vamp when the latter reveals their plans to essentially nuke New York City to take down the Patriots because not only do they desire to annihilate the Patriots, but because the public believed every word that the Patriots' Kangaroo Court spoon-fed them about Dead Cell's (framed) terrorist attacks despite Dead Cell's explainations about their being framed, they felt the world of deceit they created should be annihilated with them.
    -   He's been working on this, apparently. After the Final Boss of _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_ reveals his Knight Templar rationale for starting a war with Pakistan to provoke the American government's collapse and rebirth, Raiden replies with the ultimate Bait-and-Switch Comment:
        
        **Raiden:** _\[takes outstretched hand\]_ I was wrong... you're not greedy... **YOU'RE BATSHIT INSANE!!!** _\[uses point of contact to throw boss off ledge\]_
        
-   _Monkey Island_:
    -   One of the topics in _Tales of Monkey Island Chapter 2: The Siege of Spinner Cay_ has this when McGillicutty plans to destroy La Esponja Grande in order for him to remain Poxed along with his crew forever:
        
        **Guybrush:** You're mad! Mad, I say!
        
    -   Before that, there is also a part in _The Curse of Monkey Island_ when smuggler King André believes that the Goodsoup Family Diamond and its energy flowing though it is the key to his power, and you can choose this:
        
        **Guybrush:** You're a madman!  
        **André:** Am I mad? Am I? HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! Is it madness to sit in a cave at the top of a deserted island, accumulating vast amounts of gold and jewels and stuffed animals, stockpiling plunder from across the Caribbean and passing the savings on to you? Is that madness? Or GENIUS?!?  
        **Guybrush:** _\[shrugs\]_ Good point. I take it back.  
        **André:** I'm not crazy — my prices are!
        
-   _Mortal Kombat 9_ has another example of a non villainous version.
    
    **Raiden:** I know what we must do. "He must win" refers to Shao Kahn. He must be allowed to Merge the realms  
    **Liu Kang:** I prayed that I was wrong, but you have gone mad Raiden.

-   _RosenkreuzStilette_:
    -   Spiritia and Lilli confront Iris Sepperin in the final stage in the main game. Tia tells them that they're not getting away this time, and that's when they start Laughing Mad as they finally figure out where Tia got all her energy. Lilli begins wondering what is wrong with her as she continues her maniacal laughter. Tia then says to them, "have you lost your mind!?"
    -   In the opening cutscene of Rosenkreuzstilette Grollschwert, Grolla has this reaction when she overhears Iris' plot to have RKS fight against the Empire just for her own personal amusement.
        
        **Grolla:** What do you think you're doing!? Iris, have you gone mad!?
        
-   _Silent Hill 2_. After Eddie's rant about how he'll kill anyone who makes fun of him, James asks "Eddie, have you gone nuts?" His response is less calm than the typical villain.
-   _Warcraft_:
    -   In the story campaign of _Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne_, Illidan Stormrage is confronted by his jailer of ten thousand years with a self-righteous "You're insane!" His calm reply? "Isolation can do that to the mind."
    -   During its predecessor, _Reign of Chaos_, Grom is thoroughly reprimanded by Thrall for attacking the humans unprovoked during the third Orc mission.
        
        **Thrall:** With these zeppelins we can fly above the canyon.  
        **Grom:** A true warrior would have simply taken it from the humans.  
        **Thrall:** _Have you lost what's left of your mind, Grom? I gave you a direct order to leave the humans alone! What the hell is wrong with you?!_

    Webcomics 

-   _Girl Genius_:
    -   A rather chilling variation (the guy is fully conscious of his actions and their implications, but doesn't even have a choice):
        
        **Dr. VG:** Are you insane?!  
        **Mr. Rovainen:** Alas. That comfort is denied me.
        
    -   And a funny one:
    -   And one that's somewhere in-between the previous two:
        
        **Vole:** _VE VILL BURN EUROPA TO DE GROUND UND GNAW HER BONEZ!_  
        **Gil:** _\[Looking away, pointing to Vole\]_ This guy's _nuts._
        
-   Another similar variation from _Narbonic_:
    
    "This is **madness**! **MADNESS!**"  
    "No. Not at all. Our plan is a pragmatic response to the problems we've observed..."  
    "This is **sanity**! **Sanity**!"
    
-   There is this exchange in _PepsiaPhobia_, during the "Lord Night-Sorrow" story arc... before it was changed by a Retcon:
    
    **Night-Sorrow:** Sorcery can accomplish what science cannot.  
    **Filby: _You're insane!_**  
    **Phobia:** Figured that out all by yourself, did you?
    
-   _Magick Chicks_: Tiffany thought Faith was crazy when she bloodlusted Layla and tried to to fight her without her powers, for the sake of gaining experience against a cryptid. Though it's subverted since the comic's editor said Faith likely would have won, regardless, had she _not_ forgotten they were fighting indoors and hit her own head on the ceiling. Making it a case of Tiffany Underestimating Badassery.
    
    **T Campbell:** Layla's not exactly a pushover, but she's had relatively easy life, and never before even faced a slayer who _consistently wanted to kill her._ Even if Layla were well-trained for combat, the odds would heavily favor Faith. As it is, anything resembling a fair fight was going to more or less end like this.
    
-   _Roommates_:
    
    -   A version appeared when Javert called out Dark Jareth on why he's been forcing Character Rerailment on the others:
    
    **Javert:** Generous?! _We are tragedies_, you ass! There is nothing generous in making us repeat the same mistakes that cost us everything the first time!
    
    -   Also after the Erlkönig, who by the way considered stealing the soul of his son's best friend a reasonable idea, saw what Jareth planed for the hunt, he is quite restrained but visibly pissed:
-   _Darths & Droids_ has an unusual variant after Darth Vader's florid, self-righteous monologue justifying the destruction of Alderaan:
-   _Schlock Mercenary_:
    -   Lieutenant Piebald is a Mad Bomber Demolitions Expert that is self-aware enough to pull this on himself:
        
        **Tagon:** Give me your favorite scenario for taking this base intact.  
        **Piebald:** "Favorite," or "most likely? See, I'm a little crazy, and my favorite scenario is _**really**_ expensive.  
        **Tagon:** The Doctor briefs me weekly regarding exactly how crazy you are.
        
    -   And then an indirect one:
        
        **Piebald:** With an enemy budget that big, sir, I'd have to be crazy to work on your side.  
        **Tagon:** Then it's a good thing you're not on your meds this week, Lieutenant.
        

    Web Videos 

-   This was the reaction the rest of the Achievement Hunter team had in _Let's Play Minecraft_ when they found out not only did Ryan had a cow in a hole in his home in Achievement City, he went out of his way to get another one to foil Michael's rescue attempt with the declaration of "Edgar's the one in the hole." His reigns as "King" have turned into "Mad King" and this was even shown in _X-Ray & Vav_ with his character the Mad King.

-   _Channel Awesome_:
    -   The Nostalgia Critic and Bum Reviews did this in one of Linkara's videos. And then he starts destroying the world. In fact, the experience is probably one of the most creepy things that That Guy with the Glasses has ever done.
        
        **Critic:** My God. You're mad.  
        **Bum:** Am I? Am I?  
        **Critic:** Yes. Very mad.  
        **Bum:** Maybe it's you, who are mad?  
        **Critic:** No, I'm pretty sure it you.  
        **Bum:** You know what? You're just rude.
        
    -   The Nostalgia Critic was on the other end of this during his review of _The Room (2003)_. Other reviewers kept showing up to try and talk him out of it: when he refused to listen to Linkara...
        
        **Linkara:** You're mad, Critic! MAD!  
        **Critic: Begone!  
        **Linkara:''' Okay.
        
-   _CollegeHumor_: The skit "Font Conference" features Anthropomorphic Personification of Microsoft fonts. The villainous Ransom has kidnapped Courrier and his daughter Curlz MT, and in exchange for their safety...

    Western Animation 

-   In _Danny Phantom_, the episode that introduces Vlad Plasmius has this dialogue:
    
    **Danny:** Let me outta here!  
    **Vlad:** Why? So you can go back to stumbling through your adolescence desperately trying to get control of your powers?! Powers, by the way, that I've had for twenty years. I have experience, my child, and the money and power attained through using those powers for personal gain, you see! I could train you, teach you everything I know! And all you have to do is renounce your idiot father!  
    **Danny:** Dude. You are one _seriously_ crazed-up fruit loop. That is _never_ going to happen.
    
-   _DuckTales_:
    -   In "Too Much of a Gold Thing", the finale of the Five-Episode Pilot, El Capitán claims to have been waiting "four hundred years" for another chance to find the Treasure of the Golden Suns.
        
        **Mrs. Beakley:** Four hundred years?! You're _mad_!  
        **El Capitán:** Mad? Of _course_ I'm mad! I'm mad for GOLD!
        
    -   In the episode "Where No Duck Has Gone Before", Launchpad asks Courage, "Are you crazy?" when he insists on fist-fighting the alien leader. The episode proves enlightening for Courage.
-   Played for Laughs (Like every other trope in the show) in _The Tick_. As El Seed is raising his army of corn soldiers, we get _this_ exchange:
    
    **El Seed:** You are the glorious army of El Seed! I am on a big power trip, and you are coming with me!!! My assistants, the lovely Bee Twins, will hand out medical waiver forms and ball-point pens. PLEASE... PRIIIINT... CLEEEEEARRRRLYYYYYYYY!  
    **The Tick:** He's a madman!

Brooklyn cooperates, but when Demona attacks Goliath with a spell from the book that makes him a mind-controlled slave, the young gargoyle protests that he only wanted to Goliath to see the truth. Demona intones with flashing eyes, "You wanted him to know the truth. Now, our truth will the only truth he ever knows!" At that brazenly evil pronouncement, Brooklyn yells to Demona, "You're insane!" and attacks her to get the book back.

    -   In "Come the Apocalypse", Rogue recalls Xavier's earlier words and calls Apocalypse insane for turning mutants into mindless slaves and using them to destroy the world.

        **Xavier:** You're mad, Master Mold!  
        **Master Mold:** A machine cannot be mad, Professor. That is a _human_ failing.

        **Superman:** You're _insane_.  
        **Vandal Savage:** ...True. But that doesn't mean I'm not good company. Say, you wanna come over to my house? _\[Beat\]_ Like you've got something _better_ to do.
        
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   In "Three Men and a Comic Book", Milhouse calls Bart crazy when he accuses him of planning to kill him in his sleep to get the comic. But what really sets Bart off is when Milhouse threatens to tell his mom.
        
        **Bart:** Hey Martin. Tell him what we do with squealers!  
        **Martin:** _\[currently tied to a chair\]_ I dunno! Is it worse than what you do to people who have to go to the bathroom?

Bart protests, calling Bob a maniac, and Mayor Quimby, who authorized Bob's release, replies, "Bob is no maniac. He explained his reasons for trying to kill us all, and I assure you they were perfectly sane."

    -   In "Sozin's Comet, Part 1", when Team Avatar learns about Fire Lord Ozai's plans to use Sozin's comet to launch genocidal campaigns against the entire Earth Kingdom, which will result in the deaths of countless innocents, they can only react with horror and shock. Sokka even lampshades on this.
        
        **Sokka:** I always knew the Fire Lord was a bad guy, but his plan is just pure evil.
        
-   Occurs in the fourth season of _The Legend of Korra_, in "The Battle of Zaofu", when Varrick turns out to have built a bomb (with both a timer and a manual switch) to destroy himself, Bolin and the spirit vine samples rather than let Kuvira and Baatar Jr. get their hands on the accidental fruits of his research.

    -   In "Deep Freeze", Mr. Freeze has this response to Grant Walker's plan to freeze the entire world except for his own island. When a _supervillain_ is the one doubting your sanity, you know you have problems. Better yet, an _ice-obsessed_ villain saying this about a plan to _freeze the world_. (Of course, this has a great deal of Fridge Brilliance, pardon the pun. Freeze considers his condition a Fate Worse than Death, but Walker actually _wants_ it, causing Freeze to regard him as mad.) As Freeze himself tells him:
        
        **Freeze:** You want to be like _this_? Trapped in a world you can see but never touch? Old and infirm as you are, I would trade a thousand of my frozen years for your worst day.
        

-   _The Joker_ of all people delivers this line regarding the Creeper:
    
    **Joker:** He's a _lunatic_!
    
-   The Joker gets this quite a lot, as while people already know he's loony, he can still boggle their minds. In "Joker's Favor", Charlie Collins has lived in terror over what 'favor' Joker will have him, to the point of changing his name and moving across the country (To no avail), so he's a little thunderstruck that all Joker wants from him is to open a door and let Harley Quinn push a cake to Commissioner Gordon's dinner.
    
    **Charlie:** Wait, that's the favor? You called me out here just to open a door?  
    **Joker:** Well, look at the size of that cake, man! She can't open the door and push it in all at once! _Think!_  
    **Charlie:** _\[aside\]_ He's nuts...
    

-   _Batman Beyond_:
    -   In "Babel", when Shriek blackmails Commissioner Gordon in exchange for Batman's life:
        
        **Barbara:** You're out of your mind.  
        **Shriek:** _Duh_.
        
    -   In "Curse of the Cobra", when Xander outlines his plan to wipe out the world through triggered volcanic eruptions, while his followers will survive by turning themselves into dinosaurs and thriving off the excess heat:
        
        **Max:** I think I finally get it now.  
        _\[Xander smiles\]_  
        **Max:** You're crazy! All of you! Certifiable, in need of medication!
        
-   From _Mega Man (Ruby-Spears)_, in the episode "Ice Age" (sound clip available about a third of the way down this page):

-   Even _VeggieTales_ has a variant in a recent _Indiana Jones_ parody.

    **Bob:** Eccentric is loopy, _with money_.
    
-   _Transformers_:
    -   _Beast Wars_ has Tarantulas happily shrug this one off with a casual "So they say," and a particularly indulgent and spittle-y Evil Laugh.
    -   The _Transformers: Animated_ episode "Survival of the Fittest" has Captain Fanzone tell Meltdown that he's nuttier than a fruitcake.
-   _Wakfu_: During his fight against Nox in episode 17, Grougaloragran repeatedly calls him a madman, but Nox pays this no heed. Later, both Yugo and Adamaï give him a "You're insane!" speech at the end of the final fight in episode 26. However, since it is after Nox's whole plan is crumbling around him — with his giant clock mecha — this time the Xelor may actually be listening. To specify, the first time Yugo calls him out on his mental instability, he just shrugs it off. Later, he's surrounded by the total ruination of his plans, only to have Yugo scream that his insanity killed entire countries for nothing. This time, he actually starts _weeping._
-   In _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_, Carl, Sheen and Jimmy travel to the Bahama Quadrangle so Jimmy can prove that nothing suspicious happens there. They end up trapped by a algae obsessed scientist named Dr. Moist:
    
    **Dr. Moist:** I'd be happy to... Right after your transformation.  
    **Jimmy:** Transformation?  
    **Dr. Moist:** Into Algae-Men, just like all the other fools who've passed this way to spy on me!  
    **Jimmy:** Huh?!  
    **Dr. Moist:** That's right — your food was chock-full of mutant algae seeds.  
    **Jimmy:** Huh?!  
    **Dr. Moist:** Which even as we _speak_ are infusing your every cell with kelpy goodness!  
    **Jimmy:** Huh?!  
    **Carl:** Guys... I'm turning green!  
    **Jimmy:** But you ate it too; we saw you!  
    **Dr. Moist:** Yes, but I have the antidote! _\[drinks some of said antidote\]_ Ahh, that is _good_ antidote!  
    **Jimmy:** You're completely nuts!  
    **Sheen:** Oh gee, ya think?  
    **Carl:** What was your first clue?
