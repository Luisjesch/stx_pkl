The definitive superhero stands for our liberty.

_"I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where — wherever you look. Wherever they's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever they's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there."_

A stock reason given in the opening/narration of a show. This is why the good guys in some shows (particularly Anime, Kaiju, and Toku) fight against evil. It's for justice, righteousness, principles, and values that depend more on what people deserve than on what they enjoy. It's a good reason to launch all your fighters or Humongous Mecha and beat the stuffings out of rubber suit monsters.

This seems like Concepts Are Cheap, but these shows can have fully developed plots. This is just mainly applied to the trailers, narration, and theme songs. Then again, much of the audience is here to watch giant monsters and robots fight, so why worry about deep motives?

This trope has become somewhat anachronistic since the 1990s, with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arguably being one of the last pure examples of it. Most heroes nowadays tend to have more complex motivations than simple, unblemished goodness or altruism, and some aren't necessarily more morally desirable than the villains they fight.

Compare For Science!, Captain Geographic, Captain Patriotic, Captain Space, Defender of Earth!, and For Happiness. May be part of a Heroism Motive Speech.

The Evil Counterpart is For the Evulz, or Well-Intentioned Extremist if the villains had good intentions behind their atrocities. Do _not_ confuse with Justice Will Prevail, a more complicated topic to say the least.

This is Older Than Print, with early examples going all the way back to Ðe Faðer of Engelish Lytterature hymselfe, Geoffrey Chaucer.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   America in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_:
    
    **America**: Should we not fight in the name of justice?  
    **America**: Let the hammer of righteousness strike deep into the heart of evil!
    
-   _Slayers_: This is Princess Amelia Seiryuun's schtick throughout the series, which she gets from her father, Prince Phil. In addition to suffering from Chronic Hero Syndrome (which annoys Lina, to no end), she proudly proclaims herself to be a champion of love, peace, and justice and will smite evil with dropkicks, suplexes, and really big, EXTREMELY HEAVY blunt objects.
-   Many Go Nagai works (_Mazinger Z_, _Cutey Honey_...) have or at the very least lampshade this.
-   _Tekkonkinkreet_: "This is Agent White reporting! Keeping the peace, doing my best to fight the bad guys, wherever they may be. Over and out."
-   _Carried by the Wind: Tsukikage Ran_: Meow will fight anyone for this reason. She even calls herself 'The Beauty of Justice'.
-   _Sailor Moon_: "For Love and Justice! Pretty Guardian in a Sailor Suit, Sailor Moon!"
-   Deconstructed and ultimately subverted in _Death Note_. Both Light and L loudly proclaim "I am Justice!", but since one of them is a murderous Knight Templar vigilante and the other is a detective who sacrifices lives to obtain information and uses inhumane interrogation tactics, this claim is pretty questionable coming from either one of them.
-   In _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_, Mami's Leitmotif is "Credens Justitiam" (Believe In Justice). Sayaka also has this philosophy, but goes WAY too far with it.
-   The World Government Marines in _One Piece_ have a bit of a thing for justice. Aside from having the characters for justice printed on captain-rank officer's coats, several prominent personnel tend to have their own take on the concept, some of them not actually very just at all; Admiral Aokiji has "Lazy Justice," Admiral Akainu has "Absolute Justice," Rob Lucci has "Dark Justice," etc.
    -   It is even discussed during the Whitebeard War arc when Doflamingo laughed when Marines were crying out they were fighting for "Justice." Doflamingo pointed out how history will be written by the winner and if the Marines win, it will be a just win and if the pirates win, it too will be just.
-   Invoked by the less-dead-than-advertised Maria Ross in her stirring radio address during the Promised Day, in _Fullmetal Alchemist_. She lampshades it when speaking to Breda afterward. "Everyone cares about justice. So I used it."
-   Student Council President Els Tasmin of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid_ has this as her world-view, what with having a Barrier Jacket called Black Justice, a Device that takes the form of handcuffs, and lines such as "bad students will be punished" and "Justice will prevail". Naturally, she sees gang leader Harry Tribeca as The Rival.
-   Athrun Zala's general theme and goal in _Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny_ is seeking a correct, fair justice for the universe, contrasting Kira Yamato's goal for everlasting freedom, and Shinn Asuka's defending of a predetermined destiny.
-   Played for Laughs in _Space Patrol Luluco_ where everyone's suits shout out "Fight for Justice!" whenever they attack. Exaggerated with Da Chief, Over Justice.
-   _Dragon Ball Super_ has 2 examples:
    -   Zamasu, the Supreme Kai of the 10th Universe. Everything that he does and his beliefs in justice are taken to extreme levels, he believes a world without mortals will create the ideal world for gods. In other words, for himself only.
    -   Universe 11, the Universe of Justice. There the God of Destruction and the Pride Troopers fight for justice, against all injustices big, medium, and small. No crime will go unresolved in Universe 11, be it a kitten near power lines or Goku potentially dooming the multiverse.
-   Miko from _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ is all about promoting justice and morality, tends to classify people by whether they are good or bad, and is planning on attending law school when she graduates. According to her character profile in one of the volume extras, it's a habit she developed in order to feel closer to her often-absent mother and father (who do humanitarian aid and work as a judge respectively).
-   _Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle_: Deconstructed. The Big Bad, Fugil Arcadia, is a Knight Templar who declares himself to be a hero fighting for justice, a concept he defines as using any means necessary - such as perception and memory manipulation - to keep all political powers in balance and serve The Needs of the Many. While he recognizes that other people, including the protagonist Lux, have different definitions of justice, he considers their justice to be insufficient compared to his own because they're not willing to go to the same extremes. In his backstory, he wasn't always this zealous, but the constant conflict in his era caused him and his partner to believe that forcing the masses to forget their grudges is the only way to get them on board with their ideals.

    Comic Books 

-   _Superman_: The line in the page pic is a modified form of the radio intro which was used on the first television series. It might have been the Trope Maker.
    -   Superman is actually a subversion of this though. He's mainly concerned with For Happiness, spending most of his time doing random acts of kindness like stopping floods, chasing off supervillains, and plucking kittens out of trees. He doesn't much care what supervillains do as long as they're not hurting anyone (or being Lex Luthor). Writers have him bandy the term "justice" around a lot, but crimefighters like Batman and The Flash are a lot more focused on criminal justice than Superman is.
    -   It would be more accurate to say that Superman maintains a balance between For Great Justice and For Happiness, for the most part. Over the years, Superman's motivations to do good have changed. In some stories, he wants people to be happy. In others, he wants to bring evildoers to justice. It's all Depending on the Writer.
    -   Supergirl varies between fighting for Justice and fighting for Happiness (her motto being: "Hope, Compassion and Help for all") depending on the story.
-   In _PS238_, an elementary school for the children of superheroes (and villains), some of the superkids have picked up an odd habit:
    
    **Kid #1**: To the cafeteria!  
    **Rest of the class**: FOR JUSTICE!
    
-   The much-criticized _Justice League: Cry for Justice_ has a lot of the characters saying that they "want justice!". Which critics of the story are typically quick to point out that most of the time, the characters are actually seeking _vengeance_.
-   While the X-Men have a somewhat more original concept, and had some of the first antivillains in American comics, the promos for the cartoons would talk about using mutant powers "for the benefit of mankind."
-   _Judge Dredd_. While he can often come across as an uncompromising jerk, people too often forget that the Judge really does embody the _Lawful_ half of Lawful Neutral, and his primary motivation in doing so, is his conviction that his society will not survive without it.
-   _Captain America_: Steve Rogers is entirely devout in his belief that all are worthy to prosper, and fights tirelessly against those who would try to deny that of others.
-   _Robin (1993)_: Tim Drake's motivation boils down to his belief in the need for true justice, especially in a city like Gotham. It's a motivation he restates on several occasions but first made evident in the speech he used on Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson when he was still trying to remain a particularly well-informed and investigative civilian:
    
    _"Robin is a symbol just as much as Batman is. It isn’t just a symbol of the law, it’s a symbol of justice."_
    

    Film 

-   In _Star Wars_, Obi-Wan described the Jedi as "the guardians of peace and justice". He was talking to a young-for-his-age twenty-ish rube with stars in his eyes.
-   _Byzantium_: The Brethren's claimed goal is to work for this. We see no evidence of it in the film, however.
-   _The Suicide Squad_: Peacemaker ends up heavily deconstructing the trope. He's a brightly colored self-identifying sentinel of liberty who fights in the name of everlasting peace. On paper, this would be the usual stock motivation of a Captain Patriotic superhero. But throughout the film, Peacemaker's willingness to habitually cross whatever lines he deems as necessary in adherence to something as abstract and loosely defined as "Peace" is seen in-universe as laughably ironic at best and _horrifyingly myopic_ at worst. Once Peacemaker murders Rick Flag in order to keep the United States' involvement in Project: Starfish a secret, Rick's Profane Last Words are ones lambasting the _sheer absurdity_ that is Christopher Smith's modus operandi.
    
    **Rick Flag:** Peacemaker. _What a joke_.
    

    Literature 

-   Parodied in _Captain Underpants_ with the eponymous hero's motto of "Truth, justice, and all that is pre-shrunk and cottony!"
-   This is the driving force behind the Knights of the Cross in _The Dresden Files_. No matter what their background, the Knights are driven by the sole purpose of righting wrongs, fighting evil, and protecting the innocent. In a setting that at best runs on Grey-and-Gray Morality, they are unquestionably the Good Guys.
    -   Shifts a little later when it's revealed that they're Heaven's mortal players in preserving free will by redeeming the hosts of the Denarians at swordpoint. Any other good they do is more a result of judicious recruitment than being in the job description.
    -   Harry fights bullies. It takes him a little while to figure it out - but in the flashback to his formative duel with He Who Walks Behind, it's violence against the helpless from which he won't run.
        
        _It._  
        _Wasn't._  
        _Right._  
        No, it wasn't. But the world wasn't a fair place, was it? And I had more reason to know it than most people twice my age. The world wasn't nice, and it wasn't fair. People who didn't deserve it suffered and died every single day.  
        So what? _So somebody ought to do something about it._
        
    -   Murphy upholds the law. She's not a terribly devout Christian, but she has Faith in the law, and it's more than enough to give her a standing job offer among the Knights of the Cross.
-   Tom Joad's famous speech at the end of _The Grapes of Wrath_. "Wherever they's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever they's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there..."
-   _Don Quixote_ in a nutshell, especially in _Man of La Mancha_.
-   Solomon Kane is a fanatical Puritan swordsman Walking the Earth with the goal of righting wrongs and protecting the weak wherever he goes.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Angel_. _"We live as though the world is as it should be, in order to show it what it can be."_ Angel initially thinks that he does what he does, in order to gain redemption and avoid going to Hell; but he eventually realizes that he helps people simply because doing the right thing is an inherent part of his identity.
-   Angel's evil alter-ego, Angelus, made light of this trope several years earlier on _Buffy the Vampire Slayer._
    -   Spike, hilariously, when he discovers his chip only prevents him from hurting humans. Demons are fair game.
        
        **Spike**: What's this? Sitting around watching the telly while there’s evil still afoot. That’s not very industrious of you. I say we go out there (Rubs his hands together) and kick a little demon ass! What, can’t go without your Buffy, is that it? Too chicken? Let’s find her! She is the Chosen One after all. – Come on! Vampires! Grrr! Nasty! Let’s annihilate them. For justice - and for - the safety of puppies – and Christmas, right? Let’s _fight_ that evil! - Let’s _kill_ something!
        
    -   When Faith does a body swap with Buffy, she initially mocks Buffy's sense of morality, telling herself she won't be bad "because it's wrong." After living Buffy's life for a while, however, she comes to appreciate the change, and when towards the end she tells a group of vamps she won't let them kill innocents "because it's wrong," she means it sincerely.
    -   Buffy had her moments of this, as at least later in this series she opposed consequential ethics, and this is the trope of deontological opposition to it. Her big moment of rejecting a very persuasive consequential argument was over whether it was acceptable to kill Dawn to prevent Glory from killing all of earth's life, _including Dawn,_ as Giles pointed out was the alternative. She managed to Take a Third Option in the end, but she still preferred to let everyone on Earth die rather than kill one innocent, who would have died anyway.
-   Odo in _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ was motivated by what he described as an inborn need for justice. Law was a secondary thing. He used to theorize that a need for justice may have been an inborn trait of his unknown species...too bad it turned out not to be the case.
    -   Their natural tendency is only to enforce order and obedience. While Odo justifies the need for both with Justice (no pun intended), the rest of the species is only interested in domination (ostensibly to protect themselves from ever being victims again). Odo's experience working as chief of security under the Cardassians, witnessing the atrocities and the oppression of the innocent Bajorans, is implied to have taught him the value of Justice over pure order. He still takes the Lawful part of Lawful Good very seriously though (so long as the Law in question is itself "Good", like when he allowed several Cardassian dissidents to escape because their crimes did not warrant the death penalty they would have received otherwise).
-   _Tokusou Robo Janperson_: "Janperson fights for justice!"
-   "The Earth calls out! The Heavens call out! The People call out! They are calling on me to defeat evil! Listen well, evildoers! I am the warrior for justice... Kamen Rider Stronger!"
    -   _Kamen Rider Wizard_'s Post-Script Episodes see the villain give a Breaking Speech where he claims Riders are no different from the Kaijin they fight, only hiding behind hollow claims of being "allies of justice". The Riders promptly retort by saying that what they fight for isn't justice, but to protect peoples' freedom from those who would take it away by force. This has been the ethos of the franchise from the very beginning, with the very first Rider having said, “Human lives are more important than peace and justice,” and indeed, he fought against those who would take away human freedom by force (i.e. Shocker, an organization founded by Those Wacky Nazis).

    Professional Wrestling 

-   "Real American", Hulk Hogan's iconic WWE entrance theme:
    
    I am a real American  
    Fight for the rights of every man  
    I am a real American  
    Fight for what's right  
    Fight for your life!
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   Paladins in _Dungeons & Dragons_ often have this creed.
    -   The _Planescape_ setting has the Mercykillers faction, whose goals and philosophy are centered around the pursuit of perfect justice. Their concept of justice usually involves punishment via hard labor and/or execution. One of their founding organizations, the Sons of Mercy, were much more about the traditional construction of this trope, and they became so again when the Mercykillers split up following the Faction War.
-   The Tau Empire in Warhammer 40,000 has the unifying creed of "For the Greater Good!" Being a grimdark setting where most wars are Evil Versus Evil, this makes the Tau the closest faction to being benevolent, though they are still totalitarian and expansionist.
-   The first paragraph of the _Exalted_ Core Rulebook states that the world is being gangbanged from all directions by the Deathlords, the Yozis, The Fair Folks, and other ultra-nasty beings. But the Solars (you) are returning, _For Great Justice !!!111_. The rest of the chapter is spent hammering into your head that it's the Solar's own Unconquered-Sun-damned fault that they got bumped off in ages past, and you've got a lot of work to do if you're going to prove that you're indeed doing it For Great Justice.

    Theatre 

-   In the prologue of _J.B._, Mr. Zuss states that the point of the Book of Job is to teach Job what God's justice means. Nickles takes a more cynical view, and Sarah in the final scene says that there simply isn't any justice in what happened.

    Video Games 

-   Named for one of the lines in _Zero Wing_, said by the captain of a sinking ship as his Last Stand fighters are launched. The original Japanese line is closer to Fling a Light into the Future, but the same idea still applies.
-   "For Great Justice" is actually the motto of the Steel Samurai in _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_.
    -   Which is a Shout-Out, given how the series loves those.
    -   Then we have Apollo Justice, as in "Justice is literally **his last name**", and his catchphrase is "Here comes Justice!"
    -   _Dual Destinies_ gives us Detective Fulbright. His MO is this trope, with his own catchphrase of "In justice we trust!". Subverted when it is discovered that the Fulbright who the characters meet is actually a murderous, emotionless sociopath (and final villain of the game) impersonating the now-deceased real Fulbright, but the original presumably used the phrase honestly.
-   The end of _Mega Man_.
    
    FIGHT, MEGA MAN! FOR EVERLASTING PEACE!
    
    -   In _Mega Man Powered Up_, a remake of the original _Mega Man_ game, this is Fire Man's personality quirk, as he perceives himself as a Hot-Blooded robot hero of justice. He constantly veers into nonsensical non-sequiturs about fire, justice, vanquishing evil, and sometimes all three at once.
    -   In _Mega Man Battle Network 6_, the Joke program causes MegaMan.EXE to lampshade this line during a joke. When that fails, he tries to one-up it into "For Great_er_ Justice?" Lan is not amused.

-   Justice is what the _Suikoden_ series' Maximillian Knights are all about.
-   _Guild Wars_ and _Guild Wars 2_ actually each have a skill called "For Great Justice!"
    -   The skill in question actually has your character shout the line. It sounds hilarious from male norn or any asura. Female norn and male sylvari manage to sound deadly serious.
-   _Baldur's Gate_ features Minsc the... boisterous ranger with a big sword and a bigger voice. He may also be a little deranged but his heart is definitely in the right place. This leads to some amazing one-liners "Stand back... FOR JUSTICE!"
    -   "Feel the backhand of JUSTICE!"
-   _Dragon Age_
    -   One of the companions in _Dragon Age: Origins – Awakening_ is a friendly fade spirit that is defined by this concept. Justice is his identity, not his name.
    -   Deconstructed in the sequel, where his cohabiting the body of Willing Channeler Anders has twisted him into a demon of vengeance. With protecting the innocent now taking a backseat to punishing the guilty, but with no diminishment in drive or conviction, the duo end up doing a _lot_ of damage.
-   Probably _the_ most common character trait found in hero profiles in JRPGs. It isn't unusual to find a team of characters with no similarities apart from having "a strong sense of justice."
    -   Although in _Tales of Symphonia_ and its sequel it's discussed a lot, in that Lloyd realizes it's a Meaningless Meaningful Word and doesn't resort to just calling it out as a motivator (and gets pissed if someone else does, particularly when used by Well Intentioned Extremists like the Big Bad for both games).
    -   Completely inverted in _Star Ocean: Till the End of Time_, when in the gap between the penultimate and ultimate battle, the Big Bad Luther's world comes crashing around him and he goes rather mad. In a rather Narmy fashion, he screeches at the party that "RIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL PREVAIL!" before attacking.
-   "_Space Ace_, defender of truth, justice, and the planet Earth! ...and his girlfriend, Kimberly."
-   _Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer_: "I AM THE JUSTICE, NOT YOU."<small>◊</small> "THE JUSTICE ALWAYS WINS. NEVER FORGET IT."<small>◊</small> "NOTHING WINS THE JUSTICE."<small>◊</small> "LET'S FIGHT TOGETHER FOR JUSTICE!"<small>◊</small> All courtesy of Brider, who can only be described as a bastard lovechild of _Kamen Rider_ and _Gundam_, with the former's passion for fighting evil and defending justice dialed up. Although the above was due to the SNK bad Engrish syndrome for being an old Neo Geo game, the Japanese version still retains his passion for great justice.
-   _League of Legends_ has a twist with Mordekaiser, a selectable champion who likes to say "For great TORMENT!"
    -   The nation of Demacia is devoted to the pursuit of justice, especially against rival nation Noxus. Not that you'd know if you didn't read into the lore.
-   _Freedom Force_'s Minuteman lives by this creed.
-   _DeathSpank_ is a self-described Dispenser of Justice.
-   Tsubaki gets in on this in _BlazBlue_. She's a fan of historical dramas, and in the "Help Me, Professor Kokonoe!" segments, it's shown that it's the source for her battle quotes.
    -   Her achievement/trophy is actually named after this trope.
    -   This is also Bang Shishigami's schtick.
-   "I FIGHT IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE!" ~ Ma Chao of _Dynasty Warriors_
-   Kanetsugu Naoe of _Samurai Warriors_ is this too but is even worse at it than Ma Chao. At least Ma Chao has a rough idea of what he means by justice. Kanetsugu actually undergoes a minor existential crisis when he realizes he has _no idea_ what justice means in his world.
-   Ky Kiske of _Guilty Gear_, whose initial theme song is called "Holy orders Be just or be Dead"
-   Forms one of the major themes in _Tales of Vesperia_ in which two of the main characters are primarily motivated by ideals of justice but have very different ways of going about doing it, and both run into problems when they take their respective viewpoints too far. Per the trope's "playing with" examples, Yuri toes the line between subversion and double-subversion of this trope (and narrowly avoids Slowly Slipping Into Evil), while Flynn borders Deconstruction and ends up in Reconstruction territory by the end. The game's characteristic genre name is _to enforce "justice"_ (yes, with the word placed in quote marks) playing this trope completely straight while at the same time highlighting that it is a difficult concept to define.
    -   Vesperia's successor, _Tales of Graces_ also features a much more minor, less serious version of this. In the childhood arc, Asbel will go into battle shouting "I fight for justice!" for no readily apparent reason. This is probably to highlight that he's still too young and immature to know what he's fighting for at all, and is just saying this because it sounds cool.
-   In _Valis III_, whenever Yuko is asked what her aims are, says she's fighting for justice.
-   In _Kid Icarus: Uprising_ the sun god Pyrrhon, who helps you against the Aurum claims that, "Pyrrhon has a delivery, and its return address is JUSTICE!!!
    -   Subverted when it turns out that he was just helping Pit and company so that he could take over the Aurum. After he hijacks them, it comes back to bite him about four minutes later.
-   Raiden in _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_ is a firm believer that his sword is a tool of justice, used to protect the weak... but later in the game his sword is broken, and the replacement he uses belongs to Jetstream Sam.
    -   Then there's his Anti-Villain foil, Jetstream Sam, who wandered the world single-handedly slaughtering gangs and drug cartels before declaring war on one of the three largest private military companies in America... because hey, it's not like he can "sharpen \[his\] skills" on the _good_ guys.
-   The description of Twin Justice in _Rune Factory 4_ reads: "Justice now comes in two. Twice the justice, twice the power. Mete it upon your foes for... Uh...great justice!"
-   Steve in _Aero Fighters 2_: "I am a punk rocker, and I fight for justice."
-   In _Fairy Fencer F_, when Pippin rejoins the party after Fang/Eryn's time travel back to the past, he states that "For great justice, the full extent of my power is at your disposal!"
-   Deconstructed by Vhailor in _Planescape: Torment_. Justice is his literal _raison d'etre_, it's the reason he's still alive because he's unwilling to die as long as there is justice left to be meted out. He is completely single-minded on punishing evil, has close to no ego, and views himself as an implement of an ideal rather than a person, nigh impossible to dissuade or convince, uncompromising, believes in the rightness of his cause, and, in a world full of Grey-and-Gray Morality, utterly terrifying.
-   Deconstructed similarly in by Shirou in _Fate/stay night_. Having no sense of self-preservation, he's willing to throw his life away if it means doing the "right" thing at almost any opportunity to do so and will stop at nothing to become a "Hero of Justice". His future self, Archer, sold his soul to become a Counter-Guardian in hopes of being able to protect everyone, but instead, he was reduced to killing terrorist and radical groups of people that threatened to start wars and revolutions that had the potential to destroy the world, making him realize that "true justice" is the result of order, and that salvation of others and salvation of the self are not only different but incompatible, and since he had no idea who to actually save before making the pact, he ended up betrayed by his own ideal. In his own words, he became no more than a mere murderer.
-   In _Fire Emblem Fates_, this is both averted and played straight in two characters: Xander is more Knight in Sour Armor, believing that this trope is a complete sham, as it makes one person not see the whole picture that there's no clear cut good and evil in life. Also played straight on Arthur, who's born and raised into believing justice and doing good overall, with his quotes rife with declarations of Justice Will Prevail. The funny thing is? They're under the same banner (Nohr). Fittingly, however, they cannot support each other, and Arthur is instead the retainer of the youngest, most childish sibling, Elise, who DOES find such escapades of justice awesome.
    -   Also fittingly, Arthur has **"FOR JUSTICE!"** as one of his voiced battle clips. This trope may as well be his catchphrase.
-   Several characters in _Overwatch_, most prominently Pharah ("JUSTICE RAINS FROM ABOVE!") and Reinhardt (who is a literal, if high-tech, Knight in Shining Armor).
-   In _Shadowverse_, Heavenly Knight is all about justice. His attack line even is the trope name word for word.
-   An optional sidequest in _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_ has the protagonist Link discreetly following a girl, Mila, through the town of Windfall in the middle of the night. Once she reaches the open-air stall that she works at, she attempts to get into a safe and steal money from her boss (having recently suffered a Riches to Rags). One of the reasons that the player can give for not letting her off the hook when he catches her is that Link is "an ally of justice!"

    Webcomics 

-   _Magick Chicks_: Tiffany tries to invoke this with mixed results. She's Artemis Academy's self-appointed champion: the MMAA,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  who fights against the school's social injustices, which means she pesters Faith. On the other hand, while she's had some success, she's still really, REALLY, bad at it.
    -   She's bad at fooling anyone. She's pretty good at the action heroine bit.
-   A dark, off-hand reference in _Drow Tales_: "My blood will be spilled for great justice."
-   Ten Winds, the Old Superhero in the comic _Keychain of Creation_, (which is set in the Roleplaying Game Verse of _Exalted_,) has a habit of leaping in from off-panel to punch or kick an enemy with a triumphant cry of _"**JUSTICE!!**"_
-   Miko from _The Order of the Stick_ uses this for most of her actions. She's actually a Lawful Stupid Knight Templar, so she's not the most self-aware person that you're going to run into.
-   Referenced in _Schlock Mercenary_. The crew found the remains of a 'World Forge', with a different group already there; in the process, one of the leaders of the other side decides he wants to pull out... and tries to take some of the Tough's ships with him.
    
    Is there a coupon in there for "Hunt down the Wing Marshall and assassinate him for Great Justice?"
    

    Web Original 

-   Linkara's review of _Justice League: Cry For Justice_ issues 3 and 4 has him beginning the review with the inevitable joke of, "So, let's review issues 3 and 4 of _Justice League: Cry For Justice_. For great justice." He also turned the narmtastic line "And together, we can _be_ justice!" into a Running Gag.
-   _Harmontown_: In the Dungeons and Dragons section of the show, Erin McGathy's character, Dignity Sarsgaard, has the rather baffling catchphrase, "Let's jazz for truth!" The game screeches to a halt when she first unveils it.
-   Played for Laughs in _Bennett the Sage_'s "Anime Abandon" series, which features Censor Kaiser as a Censor Box blocking out naughty bits and invoking this trope as the rationale for doing so.
-   _How to Hero_ invokes this concept all the time. The author even mentions that he talks about Justice as a proper-nouned concept so much that his phone automatically capitalizes it.
    -   When devising a questionnaire to test potential mission control members one of the questions is simply "How big is your thirst for justice?" with the options being: a. I have no thirst. b. I have some thirst. c. I have moderate to severe thirst. d. UNQUENCHABLE.
    -   In the entry on mind-swaps the guide notes that if a superhero is inserting the word "justice" awkwardly into sentences where they don't belong then they are probably actually a supervillain who has hijacked a superhero's body.

    Real Life 

-   "Operation Enduring Freedom", the military response to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, was initially planned to be named **"Operation Infinite Justice"**.
-   "No Justice, No Peace" is an old rallying cry against unfair trials, etc.
-   Tomonobu Itakagi, formerly of Tecmo (and _Dead or Alive_ fame) used these words almost exactly in a lawsuit against the suits he used to work for.
-   This is the basis of the ethical theories grouped under Deontology.
-   Many national mottoes (official or otherwise) follow a formula that combines shades of "For Great Justice" with Rule of Three. While many of these mottoes seem quite vague, they are often popular rallying cries amongst the people, as well as being the basis for the outlook that country usually has on how the society should be run (usually reflected in its laws).
    -   The highly unofficial United States motto "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness" is probably the most famous example in the English-speaking world.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Almost directly derived from the works of John Locke (having "pursuit of happiness" stand in for the rather crasser-sounding "property" of Locke's original), it reflects America's "rugged individualism", particularly its rigid stance on individual rights and more laissez-faire attitude towards economics.
        -   The Constitution is a bit more verbose: _"... to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty ..."_
    -   A close second in English-speaking countries and probably more famous over all is France's "Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité" (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity). French democracy places a great deal of emphasis on social equality and solidarity, which often together trump the idea of personal freedom; the French have never forgotten the indignities of the _ancien régime_. This is how France justifies many policies that Americans (and, truth be told, Britons) would find repulsive, such as banning religious clothing and symbols in public places or the heavily regulated and state-directed French economy.
    -   In some parts of The British Empire (notably, the colonies that became the Commonwealth Realms), the motto "Peace, Welfare, and Good Government" (with "Welfare" referring to the general "Greater Good" rather than to its modern, narrower meaning) was popular amongst the political class of the day, typically being in the long titles or preambles of the various Acts of Parliament creating responsible governments in the colonies/dominions.
        -   It eventually morphed into Canada's current unofficial motto "Peace, Order, and Good Government", or POGG (as Canadian wags are liable to call it).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  This is often used in contradistinction to its southern neighbor, emphasizing Canadian deference to law, legitimate authority, and tradition, and Canada's generally more socially-oriented mindset (even in ultraconservative Alberta, universal public healthcare is seen as an unquestioned if problematic good).
    -   Germany has "Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit" (Unity and Justice and Liberty).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Modern Germany, as one might recall, had a very hard time getting to where it is now. Its legal system is noted for trying to strike a balance between the extremes of France and Britain in substance (in format, it's all French) and is _very_ concerned with ensuring that the rule of law is applied consistently and fairly.
    -   Sadly, not every country with such a motto is also able to follow this motto. The official motto "Justice, Liberty, Prosperity" belongs to the Republic of South Sudan, which was torn by civil wars for sixty years! "Paix, Justice, Travail" is the motto of the Kongo, one of the poorest countries in the world, and a state that has also to deal with civil war. This is universally true for every nation, the land of "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness" was built on slavery, and "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" excluded those pesky colonial nations.
    -   Marcus Garvey, who practically invented the Black Nationalism movement by himself, promulgated this motto for the UNIA: "ONE GOD - ONE AIM - ONE DESTINY." The phrase has been set to music and sung by several Rastafarian musicians.
-   Real-life inventors sometimes invent things just for the benefit of humanity, rather than for profit. Jonas Salk (inventor of the polio vaccine) is one such example. Someone even suggested he patent the vaccine to make money off of it and he replied by saying "Could you patent the Sun?" Unfortunately, this practice is becoming less and less common (see the patents on COVID 19 vaccines, for example).
