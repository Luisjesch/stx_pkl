When you think of having an animal as a pet, what comes to mind? A cat? A dog? How about a pig? That's right, a pig!

While pigs are sometimes portrayed as gluttonous, dirty, or even dangerous or scary in fiction and media and are often viewed as little more than food and livestock, sometimes people will keep these porkers as pets.

Like dogs and cats, pigs have been domesticated by humans for centuries. Though most pigs are fated for the slaughter, a select few are lucky enough to be part of the family as a housepet. Piglets can be trained at an early age to not only be well-behaved, but also loyal and loving pets. In some cases, they may also be Brainy Pigs.

In Real Life, pigs are uncommon household pets for myriad reasons. While piglets are cute little critters, adult pigs range in size from "medium dog" to "half a ton of raw porcine power" (so-called "teacup pigs" are actually piglets, not miniature adult pigs). If bored, they're fully capable of tearing apart furniture. Beyond that, proper veterinary care and a balanced, nutritious diet are more difficult to obtain for pigs than would be the case for a typical housepet such as a cat or a dog. If owners want to have a pig as a pet, they need to have big responsibilities — and big wallets — to raise them.
