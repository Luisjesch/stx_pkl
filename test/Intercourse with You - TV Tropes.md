**Stewie:** (singing) I want to have intercourse with you. Uh-oh-yeah. Inter_course_ with you.  
**Brian:** _Relations_.  
**Stewie:** Intercourse with you-oo-oo-whoo! Right?  
**Brian:** Yeah, no, great, that sounds good.  
**Stewie:** All right, groovy, groovy. Now, is there a shorter word for intercourse?

Let's face it, there's only one thing every living person (well, most people) has on his or her mind, ever, so it honestly shouldn't come as that much of a surprise that _most_ songs you're going to hear over the course of your entire life are going to be about or closely related to that one thing. People seem to really like hearing about it, and people seem to equally really like singing about it.

All sorts of euphemisms are used: making love, getting lucky, getting laid, goin' downtown, hitting the jackpot, throwing the hot dog in the hallway, play "hide the salami", making baby batter, buttering her bread, putting the key in the ignition, thrashing the thistle, scuba diving in the oasis, plugging the pudding portal, the ringing of Persian ankle bells, inserting the credit card into the slot machine, slamming the space jam in the dimensional pocket, bumping uglies, doing the horizontal tango, the hunka chunka, dancing the quilted mambo, firty ducking, woohooing, knocking boots, getting some rib, skoodilypooping, about tree fiddy, pounding the tuna, and the classic (made popular by The Newlywed Game), making whoopie. No matter what it is or where it's coming from, they're all talking about the same thing and they all get the job done.

In case you were unable to infer what is being discussed, we are of course talking about sex.

**Songs of this type can go several ways:**

1.  Be subtle. Bury what you're really talking about in Double Entendres and Unusual Euphemisms. Examples include: dance, love, work, eat, ride, teach, hit, party, and play, as well as their synonyms and associated words. ("I wanna hold your hand"—is _that_ all?)
2.  Use Lyrical Dissonance. Moral Guardians expect sexy songs to sound a certain way, usually slow and seductive. Use upbeat, folk, or pop music instead. If you do choose folk, you may not think of Fairport Convention's "Come All Ye" in the same way again....
3.  If your lines are short a couple of syllables, just add "Ooh", "Yeah", or "Baby".
4.  Use lots of panting and moaning. Also, include the sound of a woman giggling.
5.  Use another language. For example, "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
6.  If all else fails, then to hell with subtlety and just blatantly talk about sex anyway. You'll be surprised what you can get away with.

For certain cases, see Everyone Is Jesus in Purgatory and Innocent Innuendo. For other cases, see also Fanservice, formerly known as Playing to the Fetishes. For examples that are sung by groups of friends over a few beers rather than performed by professionals, see Bawdy Song.

Bad Girl Song is when a woman sings about how much she likes doin' it. Obligatory Bondage Song is when Intercourse with You gets kinky. Well, kinkier.

We just _said_ that nearly all songs are about sex. The rest are about drugs. Or rock and roll. But, this is Intercourse with You.

Overlaps with Sexual Euphemism when examples of it are used. As intercourse is usually a consequence of successful seduction, a song may transition from a Seduction Lyric into this trope as it goes along.

### Soundtracks

    Anime & Manga 

-   The ED of _Tokimeki Tonight_, Harumi Kamo's _Super Love Lotion_, has lyrics about how girls become more beautiful and attractive when they fall in love, making ever _their shampoo scent_ more seductive. The fact that the credit version features the teenage protagonist nude save for a cape leaves this very clear.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Clerks_:
    
    My love for you is like a truck, BER-SER-KER!  
    Would you like some making fuck, BER-SER-KER!,
    
-   Most of Aldous Snow's songs in _Forgetting Sarah Marshall_ and _Get Him to the Greek_ are blatantly sexual, with song titles like "The Clap" and another called "Ring Round" that outright says that it's about anal sex at the end of the song.
-   _Moulin Rouge!_ gives us the song "Meet Me In The Red Room", which is sung from the point of a prostitute entertaining a client. Complete with sexual sounds.
-   _Spring Break_: "Do It To You" by Corrinne Alphen.
-   _Walk Hard._ "Let's Duet," is one long, drawn-out Double Entendre.
    
    **Dewey Cox:** In my dreams, you're blowin' me... \*beat\* Some kisses...
    
-   Cannibal! The Musical: Packerd's ballad about his horse<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , "When I Was On Top Of You."
-   _Gotcha! (1985)_ A college student, Johnathan Moore, quotes the song lyrics from Labelle's "Lady Marmalade", "Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?", only to earn him a slap in the face!
    
    **Girl:** You asshole! **\*SLAP!!!\***
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   Victoria Wood's "Ballad of Barry and Freda" is about a middle-aged woman trying to persuade her husband to ... well:
    
    Let's do it, let's do it,
    
    Do it til our hearts go boom!
    
    Go native, creative,
    
    Living in the living room,
    
    This folly, is jolly,
    
    Bend me over backwards on the hostess trolley,
    
    Let's do it, let's do it tonight!
    
-   _Flight of the Conchords_: Parodied with "Business Time" which is about sex in a very average marriage where the singer only lasts 2 minutes.
-   _Crazy Ex-Girlfriend_ parodies this with "Sex with a Stranger". It's _super blunt_ about the singer's anxieties:
    
    I’m sorry, I’ll stop talking ‘bout the murderer thing  
    Let me get back to playin’ with your thing  
    You got a beautiful ass,  
    Strong ass arms—  
    Is that a gun?! Oh thank God, it’s just your penis.  
    Have...  
    You been tested for STDs?
    
-   _The Noddy Shop_: Johnny Crawfish's song "Special", produced as promotional material for investors, is about doing this to women. The fact that it was made to promote a preschool show makes it a surprising thing to hear.

    Musical Theatre 

-   _Chicago_...and all that jazz.
-   The songs of the Crazy Horse cabaret in Paris (which features naked dancers), most of them written by Jacques Morali. The most famous is perhaps the one that concludes every show, "You Turn Me On".
-   _Young Frankenstein: The Musical_:
    -   Inga's introductory number, "Roll in the Hay".
    -   Elizabeth has a ballad in Act Two relating her joy at having at last found "Deep Love." (Accompanied by a whole bunch more adjectives.) This was performed at the Tony Awards.
-   _Les Misérables_ has one of its most upbeat numbers, "Lovely Ladies," be all about the life of a seaside hooker! ("Rich men, poor men, leaders of the land/See 'em with their trousers off they're never quite as grand!") This is swiftly followed by Mood Whiplash.
-   The song "I Cain't Say No" from _Oklahoma!_ is about Ado Annie's inability to say "no" to boys and contains the lines: "Supposin' that he says that you're sweeter than cream/ And he's gotta have cream or die?". The show is mostly about love triangles, so it's no surprise that it's full of innuendo.
    -   "Then I think of that ol' Golden Rule/An' do fer him what he would do fer me!" (In the 1998 RNT production Ado Annie spreads her legs on this line, leaving no doubts as to what she's talking about.)
-   _The Phantom of the Opera_:
    -   "The Point of No Return" has very sexual themes including the lines: "In my mind I've already imagined our bodies entwining" and "When will the blood begin to race/ The sleeping bud burst into bloom"...if you know what I mean.
    -   "Music of the Night" isn't much better in that regard. "Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation..."
    -   Subverted later, with a verse that implies the Phantom is also impotent. "That fate which condemns me/To wallow in blood/Has also denied me/The joys of the flesh" Given what happens in the sequel _Love Never Dies_ though, he may have meant 'denied' in that no woman would have him, as he apparently could perform well enough to father a child with Christine.
-   Pretty much any song from _Spring Awakening_, most notably with "The Bitch of Living" and "My Junk" being about masturbation and "Touch Me" and "The Word of Your Body" about desiring sexual activity. "The Dark I Know Well" is an example of sex turned into horror, as it's about sexual abuse.
-   The musical _Wicked_ gives us the love duet between Elphaba and Fiyero. Lines like "I'll wake up my body / and make up for lost time," and Elphie's seductive "I feel _wicked_" near the end make their intentions pretty clear.
    -   ... But it also makes the line "If it turns out it's over too fast" a bit unintentionally funny.
-   _Avenue Q_ has "Loud as the Hell You Want (When You're Making Love)":
    
    You're not allowed to be loud
    
    At the library
    
    At the art museum
    
    Or at a play
    
    But when you and your partner
    
    Are doing the nasty
    
    Don't behave like you're
    
    At the ballet!
    
    Cause you can be as loud as
    
    The hell you want
    
    When you're making love!
    
-   _RENT_ has "Contact," which is just one big orgy under a bed sheet.
-   _The Threepenny Opera_ contains multiple examples:
-   Slight disturbing, "Hellfire", the great Villain Song from the Disney movie _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_. Partly an aversion, as it's about Frollo resisting temptation, but he doesn't leave any doubt what he actually wants.
    
    _Like fire, Hellfire,_  
    _This fire in my skin!_  
    _This burning desire_  
    _Is turning me to sin!_
    
-   "Dead Girl Walking" from _Heathers_. The entire song can be summed up as, "My life is going to be ruined come Monday, I'm drunk, I'm in your yard, so let's have sex."
    -   From the same musical, "Blue" deliberately sounds like a romantic duet...but is still about two boys complaining about how badly they want sex.
-   _Pippin_ includes "With You," which (at least in the 2013 revival) starts out as a very sweet ballad and turns into a stylized orgy.
-   Parodied in _The Book of Mormon_ with "Baptize Me". It's actually a rather sweet song about Arnold baptizing Nabalungi, which just so happens to be his first. But the actual song is full of lyrics like _"I'm about to do it for the first time/ and I'm gonna do it with a girl"_, perhaps climaxing at _"I'm wet with salvation! We just went all the way!"_
-   _Head over Heels_ turns "Heaven is a Place on Earth" into this.
-   The _Six: The Musical_ song "All You Wanna Do"'s chorus has the line "Please me, squeeze me, **birds and the bees me**".
-   _Hadestown_ has an instrumental break towards the end of "All I've Ever Known" where Orpheus and Eurydice have a stylized ballet to represent making love. Notable in that the song itself isn't about sex, though it does have Eurydice and Orpheus confessing their mutual love.

    Video Games 

-   A3 has _STEP_, the theme for Winter Troupe 8th play _Dance with Butterfly_. There is a line about "sharing heat to melt and mix together" and "touching the tip of pain," with Arikawa's segment asking Takatsu to give him his best shot, no reservation, no compromise. Also, "Non-stop night" can be heard in the chorus... On top of that, Arikawa pants a lot in the song.
-   Several songs featured in the _DanceDanceRevolution_ franchise have very steamy lyrics and moaning sounds set to very danceable tunes. Do It All Night? Oh Nick Please Not So Quick?, Turn me on? Suuuuubtle.
-   In _Fallout 4_, you may encounter the singer Magnolia at a bar in Goodneighbor, singing one of her songs (performed by her voice actress Lynda Carter), or hear her on Diamond City Radio. One of those songs, "Good Neighbor", is clearly about sex, with one verse even implying that she slept with _a Super Mutant Behemoth_.
-   _The Idolmaster_ has several of these most especially "Agent Yoru wa Yoku" ("The Agent Comes at Night") which is almost blatantly about male prostitution. There's also "Honey Heartbeat" which is most probably about a girl losing her virginity in the back of a car.
-   For the love of god, the CD version of Orchid's theme (K.I. Feeling) from Killer Instinct has this in spades
-   "Give Me All Your Love" from _The World Ends with You_, when you have lines like "Feel me when you come inside" or "Treat me right as I do for you / Drive me crazy all night long"... It's clear they weren't trying that hard to be subtle, and this is a _T-rated game_.
-   In _Idolish 7_, Trigger's debut song "Secret Night" counts as one. Even the title sounds sexual
-   _Nights of Azure_ has "Eve", the Final Love Duet that plays during the Golden Ending. The entire first half is essentially Arnice and Lilysse singing how they want to be left alone at night so they could forego sleep and do other things with each other. And to make things a less subtle, the first line has Arnice singing about "Digging our nails in, biting softly, and playing around under the moonlight".

    Web Original 

    Radio 

-   Howard Stern's "Every Homo (Backside's Back)" is a parody of "Everybody (Backstreet's Back)" by the Backstreet Boys.
-   The Finnish radio station YleX has a tradition called "Summer Rubber Song", a sex ed campaign where they get a currently popular artist to make a song about safe sex. These songs tend to be about sex.

    Roleplay 

-   _NoPixel_: Outto-Tune Tyrone's songs aren't exactly subtle; "Creampie" would probably be the best-known example, with some particularly spicy lyrics.

## In-Universe

    Anime & Manga 

-   This trope sets off the whole plot of Mayu Shinjo's _Sensual Phrase_ story. A Cute Bookworm highschool girl writes some super steamy song lyrics and intends to send them to a contest, but after some freaky coincidences the lyric sheets end up in the hands of a local rising rock star whose band is famous for its sensual songs...
-   _Macross_:
    -   Given how she is one of the more mature Idol Singers in the franchise, Sheryl Nome from _Macross Frontier_ has a few songs that dance around this trope.
        -   The first of these is _Pink Monsoon_. For that note, this is just the first verse (after the "baby pink monsoon" refrain):
            
            Till morning the two of us are just spinning around (asa made futari just spinning around)  
            There's plenty of time to fall in love (koi suru jikan wa tappuri aru no yo)  
            Be my boyfriend  
            Using our youth pointlessly (wakasa o mudazukai shitai)  
            Let's get derailed and ruined together (issho ni dassen shite dainashi ni shite)  
            Become even more deeply involved with me (motto fukaku kakawatte yo)  
            This position (kono position)  
            Is the best, you know? (saikou datte wakaru desho?)
            
        -   Putting that song to shame with absolutely _no_ subtlety about the topic is _Universal Bunny_. The fact that Sheryl spends half of the song in a Stripperiffic Dominatrix outfit all set to choreography that involves seducing her more innocent self as the lyrics keep goading the listener to go to 1000% results in a song that leaves nothing to the imagination as to what topic it could possibly be about.
            
            Smash your limits and seize your prize, 1000% (genkai koete shouten sauzanpaasento)  
            Abandon safety and indulge in pride, 1000% (anzen sutetet gouman sauzanpaasento)  
            The attractive force of despair (zetsubou no inryoku)  
            I show you my all and give you reason to love  
            Rage destructively and make an emergency (kaimetsuteki ni bousou emergency)  
            Sober up from your illusions and black out, no delicacy (gensou samete anten no delicacy)  
            A defenseless interior (muboubi na uchigawa)  
            You light up my life and give me reason to live
            
    -   _Ikenai Borderline_ from _Macross Delta_ has one particularly eyebrow-raising set of lyrics:
        
        My head is full (kirikirimai)  
        I'm going even further (saranaru chi e to)  
        My mind is melting (ishiki ga tokeru)  
        I can't control my body (karada wa seigyo funou)  
        I'm cumming (icchau kamone)  
        We screwed around as friends (fusake atta tomodachi mo)  
        We sought each other as something more (mo tome atta ano hiki to)
        
-   In an episode of _Marginal #4_, Atom has trouble understanding the lyrics of their new song, "Shinobi - Just a Heaven" (where "heaven" is written with the kanji for "climax").
    
    A premonition of danger  
    But there's no turning back for the two of us  
    Skin touches skin, in that moment  
    Lightning shoots through our bodies
    
-   One of the two openings from _Tsukiuta the Animation_, "Gravitic Love" by Six Gravity (one of the show's main idol units), is very much this sort of thing. If you doubt it after the way they sing "I wanna mess you up," just check Hajime's moan at the end of the chorus (1:17).

    Films — Animated 

-   The song "Getting Lucky" in _The Chipmunk Adventure_.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In the classic Mockumentary _This is Spın̈al Tap_, interviewer Marty comes upon Nigel composing a lovely, quiet song, which Nigel says is inspired by Mozart and Bach. When Marty asks its name, Nigel replies "Well, this piece is called "Lick My Love Pump"."
-   Aldous Snow's song "Inside of You" in _Forgetting Sarah Marshall_.
    -   Then most of the songs on the _Get Him to the Greek_ soundtrack.
    -   Especially "Ring Round My Rosie" in _Get Him to the Greek_. _"I'm talking about my asshole"_.
-   All the background music from the 2001 film version of _Josie and the Pussycats_ is like this (and NSFW at that).
-   _The Onion Movie_ parodied this with the artist Melissa Cherry (a parody of Britney Spears) whose songs all sound extremely suggestive, yet she insists they're entirely innocent.
-   Parodied in _Semi-Pro_, where the main character sings a song called "Love Me Sexy", asking women if they would like to Love, Lick and/or Suck Will Ferrel sexy.
-   In _War, Inc._, Hilary Duff's character (a parody of the sexy teenybopper type of performer) has a song called "I Wanna Blow You Up." The first chorus starts with "I wanna blow you....up." and the bridge consists of "I wanna blow you, blow you, blow you, blow you....up." Not terribly subtle.
-   In the Israeli comedy film "זוהי סדום" ("This Is Sodomy") as in the biblical city of Sodom, not the crime, which retells the biblical story from a "modern" point of view, Lot's wife is presented as-as a fat, evil harridan whose "cooking" consists of drowning tiny bits of whatever she makes in mountains of salt. She hates Lot for being a poor sucker (recall, he was the only virtuous man in the biblical version of Vegas) and always complains about how she had a promising career as a singer before she married. The only example of her "old glory" we get to see is a trippy video clip the music of which consists solely of a synthesized "KNOW ME, KNOW ME, KNOW ME, KNOW ME..." (a joke at the biblical use of "knowing" someone)
-   Ty Webb sings "I Was Born To Love You" to Lacey Underall in _Caddyshack_.
-   Mockumentary film _Never Been Thawed_ has a subplot about a Christian Rock band called The Christers: It's revealed that The Christers used to be a Hardcore Punk band called The Reacharounds, who exclusively wrote this kind of song, but decided to switch to a Christian Rock image in the hopes of getting a record deal. In a similar gag to the _South Park_ example, we hear a snippet of the Reacharounds song "Fuck" followed by the Christers song "Pray", and it becomes apparent they just replaced every instance of the word "fuck" with "pray", added a few forced rhymes, and changed very little else.

    Literature 

-   Aldous Huxley, after mysteriously averting this trope in _Brave New World_ (in which little children are taught to engage in sexual play with each other), invoked this in _Ape and Essence_ where the refrain of the latest popular song is, "Give me detumescence."
-   Discworld: Several drinking songs - especially those sung by Nanny Ogg - such as 'A Wizard's Staff Has a Knob at the End', and 'The Hedgehog Can Never be Buggered At All'.
-   _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_ has a jazzy number called "A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love":
    
    Oh, come and stir my cauldron
    
    And if you do it right
    
    I'll boil you up some hot, strong love
    
    To keep you warm tonight
    
-   Spoofed in Dave Barry's novel _Big Trouble_ with the fictional hit "I Want Your Sex Pootie" by the Seminal Fluids. (The not-so-good movie version made this into a real song. His following novel, _Tricky Business_, gave "Sex Pootie" a Continuity Nod.)
-   _King Dork_: Tom and Sam's song "I Wanna Ramone You" which mainly consists of the words "I wanna ramone you".
-   The hit song "Let's Fuck" is at the top of the charts in _Super Folks_.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In an episode of _Workaholics_, Adam tries to 'save' a wedding that's just been called off by singing a song to his new love. Only he's high on bath salts, she's crazy and homeless, and his song is all about sucking on her boobs. It's almost romantic with lines like 'I don't care that you beg for change'. It's also an Imagine Spot, as for a moment, the scene's lighting changes to an almost music video set up, with Jakob Dylan playing while Adam croons. Only to cut back to reality- Adam's all alone, and his singing is awful.
-   "Sex Hair" from _Parks and Recreation_.
    -   At one point, the heroes of _King Dork_ acquire a Christian stoner band member whose songs are like this, and the Plucky Comic Relief tells the audience at one point, just to make sure they're not confused, "This song is about the face of God."
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    
    _You make me com... plete_
    
    -   To a lesser extent in the same song:
        
        The Moon to the tide  
        I can feel you inside
        
    -   Tara's expression at that line makes it clear that she knows exactly how you're gonna take that. Keep in mind that magic was used as a really _obvious_ metaphor for sex between Willow and Tara from their first meeting (where they manage to make sexual innuendo while talking strictly about magic), right up to showing what looked like mutual orgasms on at least one occasion when a complex, powerful spell was successfully completed.
    -   Joss Whedon even says in the commentary that he'd pretty much given up on being subtle by that point.
-   Used in an episode of _Modern Family_ when Hayley's boyfriend performs a very... explicit song he wrote for her _to her family._ They are all understandably stunned, but in The Stinger it's shown that they are all singing it next morning.
-   Parodied in the _Hot in Cleveland_ episode "Bridzelka", in which Reverend Boyce (Cedric the Entertainer) sings the bluntly titled "I Wanna Have Sex with You" while reflecting on his pre-church career as a singer/songwriter.
-   UK teen series _Skins_ had a fictional TV talent show named _Search for a Sexxbomb_, featuring such catchy gems as "Juicing Down", "Ass2Ass", and "Rim Licking".
    
    Rim licking/ Clit flicking/ You're the stuffing/ I'm the chicken/ Said we're clicking/ You're still licking/ Clock is ticking/ Stick your dick in
    
    In this club they cannot tame us/ On the dancefloor tongue meets anus/ Boy I need you in my South Pole/ Put your star into my black hole
    
-   Not a full example, but the Dream Sequence music video 'Tongue-Tied' from Red Dwarf at one point has backing singers Lister and Rimmer singing "Reproductive system, baby!" complete with hip-thrusts.
-   In _Mr. Show_, the R&B duo "Three Times One Minus One" (or TTOMO) sing the song "Ewww, Girl, Ewww." The music video is this trope, but the lyrics mostly consist of "Ewwww" and "Damn." It's also Pretty Fly for a White Guy.
-   In the _How I Met Your Mother_ episode "Home Wreckers", Ted's mother Virginia gets re-married to a guy named Clint. It's a Running Gag throughout the episode that he is too honest about their sex life, and at their wedding, he sings a song about Virginia:
    
    When I squeeze her trembling bosom,  
    The blood pumps to my loins  
    When I penetrate her —
    
    -   The song cuts off after that and Narrator!Ted explains that he blacked out for the next 12 minutes of the song. The song ends:
    
    And Mahatma Gandhi, and the pancakes, and the dragooon...and you.
    
-   _MADtv_ made a Deconstructive Parody of Nelly Furtado's "Promiscuous \[Girl\]" called "Syphilis Girl" that deals with the aftermath. Timbaland discovers he got an STD from having had unprotected sex with Furtado, and they end up concluding it's their own fault. It actually has a good point to make about the likely consequences of holding promiscuity up as a virtue.
-   In _The Office (US)_ episode "Dinner Party", Jan plays a song her assistant (who she is heavily implied to have slept with) made for her:
    
    You took me by the hand  
    And made me a man  
    That one night, you made everything alright
    

    Theatre 

-   In _13_, The Jerk Jock Brett is trying to ask out Kendra, who is Purity Personified. His best friends come up with a verse filled with sex metaphors.
    
    Hey, Kendra  
    I been thinkin'  
    I gotta gotta gotta gotta get with you  
    I wanna get all up in your business girl  
    And make you feel real fine  
    Hey, Kendra  
    Come closer  
    I got myself a brand new rockin' horse  
    Why don't you come on here, mama, and rock it rock it all night long
    

Keep in mind its target demographic is young teens.

    Webcomics 

    Web Animation 

-   _Helluva Boss_:
    -   During Spring Break, Verosika Mayday sings a song called "Vacay to Bone Town" that's all about enjoying sex as a way to relax. All the while, she's using her power as a Charm Person to drive the crowd into a sinful orgy.
    -   Invoked in the song "House of Asmodeus". Asmodeus, the owner of OZZIE'S and the king of the Ring of Lust, sings an Anti-Love Song to tell Moxxie that if he's going to perform on his stage, he needs to stop singing his love song and sing something more graphic to fit the theme of his establishment.
-   In Warhammer Idol Month a lot of the songs have shades of this, such as "Promethium Passion Lover", Macha's "Claim Me" - with lines like "You are worthy, you must claim me", "If there's no pressure, there'll be no pleasure!", "I've seen our destined date, I don't mind you're late, now show me that this is our fate!" - and then Slania of Slaanesh (predictably) throws out all subtlety with "Give Me"'s blatantly explicit lyrics.

    Web Video 

-   In one pre-reboot episode of _My Little Pony: The Mentally Advanced Series_ Scootaloo's contribution to the talent contest was a song called "Working My Twerking", which she wrote to 'spread the message of love' and about how she's a 'sexy horse god of love'. Keep in mind that Scootaloo is a _filly_.
    
    I'm working on my twerking/My libido's always lurking!/'Cause you're such a pretty pony/ and this feeling can't be phony/I will take you out to dinner/Make you feel like such a winner/And before the night is over/make you feel like such a sinner!

-   _South Park_:
    -   One of the best parodies when Cartman becomes a Christian rock musician by switching "baby" for "Jesus" in a standard song like this. Hence, all of his songs are about loving Jesus...that way.
        
        _I want to get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus, I want to feel his salvation all on my face..._
        
    -   And then when the boys started a boy band, their big song was "Finger Bang", which Cartman thought was about making a pretend gun with your hand and pointing it at someone.
    -   Pretty much every time Chef sings, intentional or not.
-   _Family Guy_ gives us the Trope Namer, shown in the quote at the top of the page.
-   _American Dad!_ has Hayley invent a song that could be best named "Doing It Doing It."
    
    _Doin' it, doin' it. D-d-Doin' it._
    
    _Should we break for lunch?_
    
    _Nope! Let's keep doin' it, doin' it._
    
    _Someone's at the door._
    
    _I don't care!_
    
    _We're doin' it, doin' it._
    
    _Wanna put on our hikin' boots?_
    
    _Yeah, we'll wear them while we're doin' it, doin' it._
    
    _I like the rhythm, it is my method._
    
-   _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_: "Yeah, I wrote that. It's called 'I Wanna Rock Your Body'. And then in y-parentheses it says 'Til the Break of Dawn'".
-   _Bob's Burgers_: In "Food Truckin'", one-time character Tabitha Johansson sings very unsubtle and creepy songs about her vagina that she insists are actually about whales. Tellingly, it's Gene (who is eleven, and not really interested in girls most of the time) who points this out.
-   Par for the course in _The Legend of Vox Machina_ whenever resident Horny Bard Scanlan is involved, but special mention must go to the number performed _during a royal feast_ as a distraction: 'Pull My Beads Of Love'.
    -   His attempt to use one to magic a door into opening is also notable.
-   "Good Lovin'" from the Animated Adaptation of _Soul Music_.
    
    _Be my baby and I'll be your fool,  
    My good lovin's gonna blow your cool,  
    We'll be makin' love the whole night through,  
    Til the morning light!_
    
-   In _The Penguins of Madagascar_ episode "Mental Hen", Kowalski does a mating dance as he waves his behind at the titular hen, singing things like "tell it to the swagger end, baby", "Salty lick, sister" and "You can't handle the Kowalski". If you know how bird mating works, you'll most definitely see this song as nothing else but this. One has to wonder if the censors were hurrying for lunch break.
-   _Steven Universe_ has always featured Gem Fusion as a metaphor for relationships, including sexual ones. The episode "The Answer" features a song that Ruby and Sapphire sing which is obviously about the first time they fused, but parts of the lyrics can be interpreted as one person having had sex for the first time and the other having made love for the first time rather than having sex randomly.
    
    **Ruby**: _Oh... Um... I just can't stop thinking..._
    
    **Sapphire**: _So... Um... Did you say I was different?_
    
    **Ruby**: _And you hadn't before?_
    
    **Sapphire**: _Of course not! When would I have ever?_
    
    **Ruby**: _I'm so sorry!_
    
    **Sapphire**: _No no, don't be!_
    
-   The _Oh Yeah! Cartoons_ short "The Feelers" had Mitzi Moth of the titular rock band of anthropomorphic insects sing a rather suggestive song called "100 Watts of Love".
    
    **Mitzi**: I can handle any candle, I'm a match for any match, and most flashlights I can pass right by. But there is a light I see who is just fila-meant for me. You must agree I find him one bright guy!
    
    **Mitzi, Mo, Max, and Stinger**: 'Cause he's 100 watts of love! Yeah, he's 100 watts of love!
    
    **Mitzi**: Oh, his kisses really burn and yet I always will return to get 100 watts!
    
-   _Robot Chicken_ gives us the Avatar-inspired "Blue Rabbits F\*\*king." Sung by Patrick Stump, no less.
-   _The Simpsons_ had a one-shot character named Lurleen Lumpkin, who attempts to seduce Homer with the decidedly subtle "Bunk With Me Tonight." Which mostly consists of her singing those four words repeatedly. Homer doesn't get it.
