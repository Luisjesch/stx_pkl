_Or maybe it starts later, once she meets Haruka and Michiru. Maybe it only begins once she realises they're dating; realises that two girls dating is a thing that can happen, that feeling about girls the same way she's supposed to feel about boys is even possible. Maybe it only begins once she has enough information to put all pieces of the puzzle together._

Sometimes, a character needs a little encouragement to realize (or fully understand) that they are on the LGBT spectrum. Usually this involves falling for someone, but it can even be something as simple as seeing something in the media and realizing it fits them. Another way is that someone in the spotlight, such as a celebrity, comes out, which inspires others to come out too.

There is some Truth in Television in this. Many people don't understand what being gay, bisexual, transgender, asexual, etc. is until they see it in fiction or on the news. This is one reason why many people believe that LGBT representation in media is important.

Super-Trope to Closet Key, which is when feelings for someone provokes the revelation in people, and Last Het Romance, which is when a character realizes they're gay after trying to date the opposite gender. Sub-Trope to Tomato in the Mirror and related to Coming-Out Story and Coming Of Age Queer Romance. Bi-Wildered is also a common trope causing one of these. See also Mentor in Queerness. Compare Queer Establishing Moment, where the narrative establishes a character as queer, whether they knew they were queer beforehand or not. If this happens later in life, this is a Late Coming Out.
