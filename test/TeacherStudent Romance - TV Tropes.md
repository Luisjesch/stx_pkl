_"I've got it bad, got it bad, got it bad, I'm hot for teacher."_

It is a pretty good bet that almost any show that features adults and teens interacting in an academic environment will eventually explore a romantic relationship between a teacher and a student. The basis for such a relationship — if it's _actually_ a romance, and not just a Sextra Credit arrangement — might be the student's adoration and respect toward the teacher, the teacher's protective and caring instincts toward the student, or both. While the illicit, forbidden, and most often scandalous nature of these relationships can be mined for angst in-universe, they usually don't cause real-life issues because the actors themselves are generally all above the age of consent thanks to Dawson Casting. But even if the student is eighteen or in college, this sort of extracurricular activity would still be considered a _massive_ breach of professional ethics in most of the world, and in some jurisdictions is illegal regardless of age under certain circumstances (for instance, some high school teachers have been charged for having relationships with students even if those relationships didn't begin until after the student turned eighteen and the teacher was only a few years older). And even where it isn't illegal, such an affair is usually socially unacceptable enough to cost a teacher or professor their job forever if discovered.

There will usually be different levels of moral endorsement of the relationship, depending on the ages and genders of the participants. As far as age goes, whether the student is above the age of consent is the critical factor, and after that the larger the age gap, the less acceptable a relationship will be seen. For gender, relationships between male teachers and male students are condemned the most harshly. When a male teacher and a female student are together it results in the teacher being viewed as a pervert and sometimes the student being slut shamed. When it's the other way around, a female teacher with a male or even a female student is taken far less seriously. An even more outrageous double standard is that emphasis is often placed on how _attractive_ said female teacher is — the more attractive said teacher, the more acceptable the relationship is. That said, the trope in fiction probably _will_ involve a Hot Teacher, if only for fanservice purposes.

An author might attempt to make this relationship less squicky by having the student fulfill the Wise Beyond Their Years trope, by keeping things to Courtly Love only, or by making both participants older — a graduate or returning adult student falling in love with _their_ professor is less likely to cause moral outrage than a high school student doing the same thing due to both participants being adults, though the professional ethics of the situation remain the same.

The relationship may be initiated by a Fille Fatale. A subtrope of Unequal Pairing, and also frequently overlaps with Power Dynamics Kink. Compare Mrs. Robinson. See Likes Older Men, Likes Older Women, and Stacy's Mom for young people lusting after older people in general, Precocious Crush for a more innocent variant, Age-Gap Romance for when there's a significant age difference between them, Inherently Attractive Profession when the teacher position is part of the appeal, and Mentor Ship, when fans ship a mentor and their protegee. Can lead to I Will Wait for You if the teacher decides to wait until their pupil has graduated to get together with them. There's a version specific to magic users called Merlin and Nimue, which takes its cue from Arthurian Legend where Merlin formed such a pair with several women. Teacher/Parent Romance occurs when a teacher falls for their student's parent.

This group of tropes is among The Oldest Ones in the Book. Although generally frowned upon in Real Life today, it's had varying levels of acceptance throughout history. It was most famously acceptable in Ancient Greece, where it took the form of Lover and Beloved. In modern universities, it's an easy joke to ask "Have any of your colleagues left their wives and married one of their grad students?" because, though it's seen as kind of lame, it's still very common.

## Examples:

### Hot for Teacher

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Boys' Love example: Atsushi from _Bad Teacher's Equation_ has been infatuated with Masami aka Ma-chan, his neighbor and caretaker, for years. He transfers to his new high school and finds Ma-chan... or so he thinks, as the guy he thinks it's Ma-chan is actually Ma-chan's older brother, Masayoshi, who works as the school nurse and basketball coach.
-   Kirino Chiba and her kendo instructor Toraji Ishida are strongly implied to have a 'thing' in _Bamboo Blade_.
-   Iruka Nanase of _Beach Stars_ is heavily implied to have the hots for her club adviser, Kyosuke Honda. While he's fond of her, he tends to keep his distance and treat her like a little sister, much to her chagrin.
-   In the _Blue Drop_ anime, Mari is infatuated with her chemistry teacher, Yuuko.
-   _Daytime Shooting Star_'s main plot is about high school freshman Suzume developing a crush on Shishio, her homeroom teacher.
-   Kitagawa of _Doki Doki School Hours_ has a huge one-sided crush on her homeroom teacher, Mika.
-   Invoked Trope in _elDLIVE_: Chuuta's teacher Saotome is introduced as she playfully scolds two of her students while pushing their cheeks against her ample bosom as they're completely smitten by her, to the envy of surrounding students, and even invites them to the karaoke. However, the truth is that she's actually a huge, ogre-like alien who uses her sexy teacher disguise to seduce her students and devour them.
-   Akari from _Even Though We're Adults_ had a crush on her teacher, Ayako Shimoda, in elementary school.
-   _Fushigi Yuugi's_ Eikoden OAV has Taka Sukinami/Tamahome working as the basketball coach of Miaka and Yui's old school; one of the girls on the team, Mayo Sakaki, falls for him.
-   In _Gal Gohan_, the titular Gal falls in love with her Home Economics teacher after being the only one who didn't give up on her. While her feelings are reciprocated that they marry in the last chapter, by that point she had already graduated and was in culinary school.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_:
    -   This was actually Onizuka's original motive for becoming a teacher- he briefly dated a schoolgirl who, after she dumped him, went back to her ex-boyfriend, who was her teacher. So Onizuka resolved to become a teacher himself in order to chase skirt.
    -   This was Miyabi's backstory. She had a crush on her teacher. When she found out he was engaged, she pretended he had raped her and ruined his reputation as she spread the rumor over the school. However, this would backfire on her as one of her classmates would be expelled for assaulting said teacher and the teacher quit rather than explain his innocence.
    -   Also in the manga Urumi Kanzaki develops a crush on Onizuka and it gets even stronger after he saves her when she tried to commit suicide.
    -   Happens to Danma Ryuji in _GTO: The Early Years_. They dated and eventually got married, but she leaves him because she doesn't want to rob him of his teenage years.
-   _Gunslinger Girl_: Thanks to their conditioning most of the girls have a Precocious Crush on their handlers, whose job is also to instruct them. Hilshire in the only handler we see acting like a classroom teacher (the girls also lessons in history and literature as well as the arts of war) but when Maria Machiavelli raises this trope with Triela and encourages Triela to express her feelings for Hilshire, Triela replies that even if she was in love with him it's not that kind of relationship. The cyborg/handler pairing is referred to as _fratello_ and the 'love' these girls feel is based on their conditioning, making any relationship Questionable Consent, as Triela is well aware. Petrushka, an older second generation girl, has romantic feelings for her handler/instructor Sandro, but it's unclear as to what extent he reciprocates beyond kissing her.
-   Mentioned in a flashback in _Hanamaru Kindergarten_. Anzu's mother got pregnant by her art teacher, married him, and dropped out of school. Generation Xerox takes effect, as Anzu has the same idea for Tsuchida, her kindergarten teacher. Sakura, Anzu's mother, _approves_ of this. It's played off as a tremendous Precocious Crush, which is common with little girls and guy teachers in real life. It's never really stated whether Anzu's mom realizes this and counts the relationship as harmless (to encourage Anzu to develop feelings of love and friendship), or if she's actually serious about approving their marriage before she even turns 6.
-   _HappinessCharge Pretty Cure!_ has the 14-year-old Megumi Aino having a crush on her seemingly immortal Physical God mentor Blue, but is constantly stopped by one of Blue's rules stating that Cures are forbidden from falling in love. It doesn't help that said rule exists because of Blue's Commitment Issues with another Cure that had a crush on him, and was personally responsible for Queen Mirage's Start of Darkness and Phantom's Roaring Rampage of Revenge...
-   In _Hayate the Combat Butler_, one of the Haukou students confesses to the teacher Shiori Makimura.
-   In _Hell Teacher Nube_, although Kyoko's definite love interest is Hiroshi, she still harbors an unrequited crush on the titular teacher coming from the time he saved her from an almost fatal demonic possession.
-   _Hitorijime My Hero_ follows the relationship between a male student and his Math teacher (who also happens to be his best friend's older brother).
-   _Isabelle of Paris_: Jules was initially hired as a piano tutor for Geneviève, and ended up falling in love with her. And then he got her pregnant.
-   In _I Think Our Son Is Gay_, Hiroki had a one-sided Precocious Crush on his math teacher in middle school and paid extra effort on math to impress him. This causes his father Akiyoshi to mistakenly believe that Hiroki is good at science, which comes to a head in Chapter 35 when Hiroki has to choose between humanities and science tracks. He chooses the humanities track to follow his current Love Interest Daigo, at which point Akiyoshi accuses him of missing the point. Tomoko, the mother, has to remind Akiyoshi that Hiroki's math fell off a cliff after going to high school.
-   _Junkers Come Here_ has a variety of this. Twelve-year-old Hiromi has a typical Precocious Crush on her twenty-something stay-in tutor Keisuke.
-   The main story of Seinen manga, _Kanojo Wa Sore Wo Gaman Dekinai_, the main characters are a shy and depressed male high school student who constantly wears a dog suit and a quirky female university teaching assistant that falls in love with his smell. It progresses from there...
-   _Kin Kyori Rennai_ involves Umi's love with her English teacher, who she gets private tutoring from.
-   A quite important subplot in Setona Mizushiro's _Kurobara Alice_. The local Hot Teacher Azusa Kikukawa and her student Kouya are secretly dating... and then, when Kouya is seriously injured in an accident, Azusa makes a Deal with the Devil (or more exactly, with a bunch of rather sui-generis vampires) to save him: they'll save Kouya's life, and in return Azusa will give her soul to them to place it in the body of a girl named Agniezka, now named _Alice_. Too bad "Alice" finds Kouya later, and sees in horror that he actually crossed the Despair Event Horizon and become a borderline Empty Shell.
-   In _Love Hina_, Naru had a big crush on her Private Tutor Seta back in middle school and set on entering the University of Tokyo because Seta is a teacher there. During the series, she's still attracted to Seta, but knows he only cares for her as his former student and moves on to her fellow Rōnin Keitaro.
-   In _Maison Ikkoku_, Godai Yuusaku is pursued by a student from his love interest Otonashi Kyoko's _alma mater_, Yagami Ibuki, after he did a stint as a substitute teacher there.
-   _Mazinger Z_: In the manga storyline Boss was infatuated with his teacher. However, his crush was unrequited and it went nowhere.
-   In _Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch_, Hanon has a gigantic infatuation with her music teacher, who she refers to as Tarou-chan.
-   In _My Monster Secret_, Sakurada (one of Those Three Guys) admits that he's got a crush on their teacher Akari, but doesn't feel he can confess until he can defeat her (they're both former delinquents, and Akari's responsible for Sakurada's mellowing out). All of Sakurada's friends become Shippers On Deck, not just because he's the nicest guy you could ever meet but because Akari's been freaking out about being single for a while and they want her to be happy. Sakurada finally confesses in chapter 142, making this upgrade to a mutual version. It's still downplayed a bit as she explicitly points out the impropriety of a teacher dating a student and even though she returns his feelings they won't actually _be_ a couple until he graduates.
-   In _My Wife Is a Demon Queen_, while Xiang Ye is devoted to Isabella, he can't help but find the female teachers at the Royal Academy, especially Wadley Aisi and Dorona, attractive. He even crafts figures of them wearing bikinis.
-   The _Negima!_ metaseries does it differently, in that the teacher is actually younger than the students... but it's deliberately set up to _look_ like a Harem Series without actually being one. The entire idea is lampshaded and deconstructed on multiple occasions; several of the students feel attracted to Negi, but are aware of how unconventional it would be to date an underaged teacher. Negi constantly worries about maintaining a normal student-teacher relationship with the girls, but it gets progressively difficult.
-   _Patlabor 2: The Movie_: This was committed by Shinobu, _of all people_, when it's revealed she once had an affair with her old instructor, while she was a cadet at the Tsuge Institute. More to the point, he was more than ten years older than her<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and was a married man. At the film's conclusion, it strongly implies that she still has feelings for him.
-   A running gag in _The Prince of Tennis_ anime series is Reiji Shinjou's obsessive loyalty to his coach, the busty and gorgeous Aoi Hanamura, which borders on a Stalker with a Crush level. In the _Atobe kara no Okurimono_ mini-movie, Reiji is constantly spouting ''... Sensei!!" at her while looking betrayed during a scene that parodies dating shows. Hanamura-sensei herself practically ogles and fangirls her own pupils when in really high spirits, both in the Jyousei and the Senbatsu arcs.
-   _Salad Days_: Honjou's in the school's news club. He frequently gets reprimanded by Mr. Miyagi for writing sensational garbage articles. It gets to the point the he's so fed up he decides to just run with an unverifiable story about his supervisor being violent and abusive against students. But before he could realizes his plan, a cute senpai named Ryouko Matsushima comes into the club room and tells him her experience when working under Mr. Miyagi. Her situation was comically similar: she also wrote bad articles, got scolded, then decided to write a libelous article about this scary looking guy who was rumored to be a thug. It turned out that this guy only looked scary, and because of his looks nobody believed him. It was so serious this time around, that instead of giving a comical knock on the head, Mr. Miyagi just straight up slapped her and gave her some serious reprimand about how irresponsible she was to accuse someone who couldn't defend himself of something horrible. The incident left such a deep impression in her that she started developing feeling for him and ended up marrying him. Her moving story sways Honjou so much, the next morning, even though he still gets punched by Mr. Miyagi for writing an article about "Mr. Miyagi (35) marrying his former student (23)", he still chooses to maintain journalistic integrity and just makes good, light-hearted fun of his teacher.
-   Played for dark laughs in _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_. The plot revolves around a suicidal teacher who accidentally wins the hearts of nearly all of his students, some more extremely devoted than others. Itoshiki himself rarely returns any of the feelings of his Harem ...until the end. What happened is that he had loved the First Girl, Fuura Kafuka, long ago and saw her die. Kafuka's organs had gone to the twelve girls (and one guy) in the class he teaches. Kafuka's able to possess them that way, and eventually, in his eyes, Itoshiki marries Kafuka. To outsiders, though, it looks like he married them all.
-   A much more unusual case with Yoshiko in _Shimeji Simulation_. It is implied that Yoshiko harbours romantic interest with her own homeroom teacher Mr. Takahashi. In Chapter 41 both of them are later seen in a bizarre-looking wedding ceremony in West Yomogi, where they later become Happily Married.
-   Reina from _Sound! Euphonium_ mentions having a crush on her music teacher Taki, who she's known for years. This is given more focus in season 2. Taki doesn't take notice of Reina's crush on him.
-   A Hentai/Romance manga called "Teacher and Student" by artist Fuuga revolves around the budding relationship between a student and his teacher when an eviction causes them to move in together. Interestingly, there's a good deal of focus on their own concerns about the relationship, as opposed to being worried about what others will think. Subverted in that by the end, she's resigned and is no longer his teacher.
    -   Many of the titles in the "Fuugaverse" are based around the same group of students/teachers, so this topic comes up a couple of times in various forms through his works.
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul_, Akira Mado reveals that her parents were such a couple. Kureo met Kasuka when she was one of his instructors at the Academy, and eventually married her after several failed proposals.
    -   Mutsuki Tooru has feelings for Kaneki/Sasaki who was once the former's mentor and teacher. He eventually goes full-on Yandere when the latter leaves and Mutsuki sees him with Touka. It's worth noting he always calls Sasaki/Kaneki "Sensei" which is Japanese for teacher.
-   The story _The First Goodbye_ from the hentai collection _Virgin Night_ is a deconstructed edition. It's made pretty clear that Saki is The Vamp, and poor Kou is riddled with uncertainty about what this relationship is really made of. Then he gets a notice of Saki's wedding at the end
-   Makoto and Takatsuki from _Wandering Son_ both have crushes on the same teacher in middle school, though neither knows of the other's crush. Maho, the protagonist's older sister, is implied to have fallen for the same teacher when she was a freshman. There's also a background character who has a habit of flirting with one of the teachers.
-   When the Childhood Friends from _You and Me_ were in preschool, Kaname had a crush on their teacher.
-   In _Yuri Moyou_, which is about four sisters and their various lesbian romances, Ryo, the eldest sister, is in love with her student, Hikari. Despite being a couple, Ryo sets some firm boundaries, such as that they can't kiss or have sex until Hikari graduates. Despite trying to maintain her dignity as a teacher, Ryo finds out that her feelings for Hikari bring out her childish side.
-   In _Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs_, Kogarashi had a crush on Ouga Makyouin, the master who taught him the Yatahagane fighting style. For her part, she only saw him as a younger brother.

    Comic Books 

-   Multiple stories in _Cherry Comics_ feature Cherry or one of her friends having sex with a teacher.
-   In _Gold Digger_, Gina's mother reminisces with a friend about their martial arts teacher.

Naturally, a fight broke out.
-   In _Le Petit Spirou_ all the male students (and some of the teachers), especially Spirou, are in love with Miss Claudia.
-   In Alan Moore's _Lost Girls_, Alice recounts her time at boarding school and reveals that she was infatuated with her P.E. teacher Mrs. Redman, who later hired her as a personal assistant and sexual plaything. This leads to drug-fuelled lesbian orgies, until Alice spills the beans and Mrs. Redman has her committed.
-   When Nightwing aka Dick Grayson became an agent for Spyral in the comic series _Grayson_, his "cover" involved working as a gym teacher at a boarding school for female assassins. A lot of the teenage students are outright lusting over him, and his boss altering his cover to make him seem gay does not change their attraction in the slightest: the next time they're shown, they're discussing the respective qualities of his left and right butt cheek.
-   _Pacific Rim: Tales from Year Zero_: Jasper Schoenfeld had an affair with Caitlin Lightcap, one of his grad students, while being married. They pick it up again while collaborating on the Jaeger, but she breaks it off after she starts drifting with Sergio.
-   Subverted in a classic _Supergirl_ _issue_. Linda Danvers -the eponymous heroine- saves her Professor Allan Forsyte from drowning. Several of her classmates find her as she is doing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and think they are making out.
-   _Twisted Dark_: The story "Smile..." chronicles the love affair between Helen and her teacher, Derrek O'Malley. It ultimately results in Derrek knocking her up.
-   The _X-Men_ have a few of these:
    -   _Emma Frost_ has a teenage Emma developing a crush on her art teacher — and when her mind-reading powers set in, she learns that he's attracted to her as well. Emma's Magnificent Bastard of a father gets the teacher fired (and forbids him from ever seeing Emma again). They later meet again when Emma ends up attending a college where he is teaching. There the teacher, Emma, her telepathic roommate, and Emma's new best friend get involved in a love rectangle where the roommate telepathically manipulates the best friend into accusing the teacher of sexual advances in order to remove the two people standing between her and Emma. In response to this revelation, Emma mind wipes her roommate, then uses her own psychic power to hijack her best friend's mind and make everyone think she's a lying, crazy stalker. Afterward, Emma confesses to the teacher what she did in order to protect him, in the name of being honest with the man she loves in hopes that he would not hold it against her in the event he wanted to begin a relationship with her at last. Unfortunately, finding out that Emma was a mutant AND had used her psychic powers to get her best friend labelled insane causes him to reject Emma, turning her into the cold-blooded villain she would become.
    -   In _New Mutants_, Josh Foley had a fling with Rahne Sinclair while she was in the process of becoming a teacher at the Xavier Institute. It ended pretty badly - Foley's healing powers accidentally re-activated Rahne's lycanthropic abilities, and she accidentally maimed him (he got better, of course, being a healer.) Despite this accident, and despite Rahne becoming a teacher at the school, they still kept the affair going for a while afterwards, but then Wither found out and let everyone else know, resulting in Rahne deciding to resign.
    -   _Ultimate X-Men_: Mystique was once in a relationship with Xavier when she was his student.

    Fan Works 

-   _Any Last Words_: During the 3rd Quarter Quell interviews, District 10 victor Dace Liotta is heavily rumored to be in a romantic relationship with his former mentee and current district partner Akane, who also calls him "Daddy" by mistake. However, Ceaser briefly wonders if this is just the two of them playing with the Capitol audience to stir up negative feelings about the Quell and gain sponsors.
-   In the _Sherlock_ fanfic _Baker School Blitz_, Jim Moriarty's erotomania has him fixated on his biology teacher and acapella group advisor, Mr. Lestrade, in a sexual-romantic way. Lestrade has made it clear to Jim - and every other student in the acapella group - that he doesn't want to do anything like that with Jim, ever.
-   _The Bolt Chronicles_: Subverted in "The Teacher." Penny develops a crush on the new Hot Teacher in school and makes a Love Confession to him not long afterwards. He rejects her advances, though.
-   _Child of the Storm_:
    -   The fic subverts this, with Sean Cassidy and his assistant, Warren Worthington III, as the subject of much lusting by the Hogwarts student body, including Hermione Granger, but nothing more.
    -   Also subverted between Harry and Betsy Braddock, his psychic tutor - who is stunningly beautiful and quite young. While it's speculated and he definitely has a crush (which she gently teases him about), she very firmly makes it clear that it's not happening on ethical grounds - both in terms of age and power imbalance.
    -   Played straight, however, when Harry Dresden becomes Wanda Maximoff's apprentice and boyfriend.
-   In _Children of Time_, fifteen-year-old Beth Lestrade crushes on her fencing instructor, and later lampshades the trope by saying that was unusual for her and was typical instead of the "other girls." Of course, her teacher turns out to be Sherlock Holmes, her hero and longtime book crush. With the help of time travel on the part of the Doctor (the reason Holmes was in the late 21st century in the first place), Beth is seventeen the next time the two meet. They do get married when she is eighteen.
-   _Fate Ends_ firmly subverts this. Luo Binghe very much wishes to enter in a romantic relationship with Harry, pointing they're around the same age and power imbalance isn't that important since the half-demon currently is the ruler of demonkind. Unfortunately, Cang Qiong still labels his feelings as unfilial — a xianxia setting treats teachers as parents — and Harry himself is horror-struck by the prospect of abusing his student's trust. Also, Luo Binghe has pretty unhealthy ideas about what can be construed as love, contributing to his failure to woo Harry.
-   _Higher Learning_: Zigzagged. Asuka thought their new teacher, Kaoru, was pretty hot, but her feelings were nothing but a short-lived crush, which vanished when she and Shinji got together. However, when Shinji got swallowed by Leliel, she turned to Kaoru to vent her worry and grief. He held her while she cried and reassured her everything would be fine. Impulsively and unthinkingly she kissed him. Then she realized what she had just done, freaked out and ran away. Later Kaoru apologized and offered to quit his job to show his repentance, but Asuka replied it was not his fault and both agreed to not talk about it ever again.
-   Astelle in _Princess Trixie Sparkle_ was in love with her much, much older teacher Starswirl. Alas, it was one-sided. Astelle mistook his platonic affections for romance because Starswirl was the only stallion who paid attention to her.
-   _Professor Arc_ racks up a number of these. Some omakes imply he's got his own fan club. Most notably, both Ruby and Yang are interested in Jaune, with Ruby nursing a more subdued interest while Yang is as subtle as a semi-truck. When Mercury was found trespassing on his property, he ended up having to feign this in order to explain his actions.
-   _To Cherilee With Love_ revolves around this trope. To start off with, Sweetie Belle has a crush of Cherilee. She asks Dinky for advice on this, and Dinky in turn asks her mom for help. Unfortunately, Ditzy misunderstands Dinky's explanation and thinks that _Dinky_ has a crush on Trixie (who's been tutoring Dinky in magic). When informed of this, Trixie promptly asks Lyra for help dealing with the issue, but Lyra misunderstands and thinks that Trixie is confessing to a crush on _her_ teacher—Princess Luna! And she shares this mistake with Luna. Hilarity Ensues.
-   Despite having originally called him an "asshat", original character Aiko Uzumaki ends up developing this for Kakashi in _Vapors_. It is not played for laughs, causing her considerable personal distress and embarrassment, no matter how sweet or amusing her superiors think it is. Not only does Jiraiya end up shipping them, despite Kakashi's discomfort, but a time travel incident leaves Minato Namikaze with the impression that 30+ Kakashi is sleeping with his fifteen-year-old daughter.
-   In _Warmth_, nearing graduation, one of Minamo's PE students asks her out on a date with her. She knew that Minamo would decline her it but felt the need to ask anyway.

    Film — Animated 

-   _Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown_: Linus and Violet are both shown to have Precocious Crushes on their teachers. Both end up being rejected, however, as Linus couldn't give Miss Othmar his valentine for her on account of her riding off with her boyfriend, while Violet gives her teacher a bottle of heart-shaped shaving lotion while forgetting that he has a beard.

-   _The Boy Next Door_: Noah Sandborn develops an obsession with Claire Peterson, who teaches at his new school. Claire is eventually seduced to have sex with him, but the context makes it clear that she is being taken advantage of, as a Struggling Single Mother who is dealing with emotional issues caused by her husband's unfaithfulness.
-   _Daydream Nation_ is a newer film that centers around a bored teenager that falls for her teacher. Maybe because she moved to a painfully small town which she hates. There, she observes her fellow high school students get wasted on drugs out of boredom, and people obsess over a serial killer who has yet to be caught. She also becomes involved with someone her age, and the rest of the film explores the insecurities that everyone, young and old, experiences in life.

-   In _Hunky Dory_, Davy misguidedly pursues the affections of his drama teacher Vivienne after being rejected by a longtime unrequited love. She kisses him, but the film mostly leaves the two in a state of Unresolved Sexual Tension.
-   In _Jack_, the title 10-year-old character (played by Robin Williams) develops a crush on his teacher (played by Jennifer Lopez), partly because she's nice to him, and largely because she's an adult and thus looks more appropriate for the age he appears to be (40).
-   In _Juno_, it's mentioned in passing that Juno's best friend Leah has a crush on one of her teachers.
-   In _Loose Screws_, the four main male characters are students of Cockswell Academy have the hots for the French teacher Mona Lott and attempt various means to score with her. None of them succeed, though at the end during a school assembly when she is exposed to an aphrodisiac gas, she performs a striptease under the influence.
-   _Loving Annabelle_: Annabelle is very attracted to her teacher Ms. Bradley. Ms. Bradley reciprocates her attraction, but initially resists given that she's her teacher. However, she eventually gives in and they start a relationship.
-   One of the earliest examples (and one of the possible Trope Makers) was 1931's _Mädchen in Uniform_. Fourteen-year-old Manuela, along with a lot of other girls at her strict boarding school, falls head-over-heels for the young female Scripture teacher. The teacher explains that she can't play favorites, but she does seem to have some reciprocal attraction to Manuela.

-   In _Mr. Holland's Opus_, one of Mr. Holland's students falls for him and tries to persuade him to run away to New York with her.

She doesn't take the rejection well.
-   In _A Night In Heaven_, a love affair develops between a community-college professor and her failing student.

She puts the dragon back in the book, but is left heartbroken by the entire affair.

### Hot for Student

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Akatsuki no Aria_, 16-years-old Aria's piano teacher Shiroyuki is one of the many men who hold feelings for her. He's aware that she doesn't romantically love him, however, _and_ he's also married to a very Delicate and Sickly girl, so he angsts quite a bit about all of this. And he dies later.
-   There is a squicky one-way instance in _Azumanga Daioh_, in which Kimura becomes obsessed with Kaorin (of all girls), declaring that they will always be together. Kimura himself is pretty squicky since he apparently became a teacher _just to ogle teenage girls_. It's later revealed he has an incredibly hot and incredibly nice wife.
-   In the Hentai _Bible Black: Walpurgiz Nacht_ after The Hero is thrown out of the coven by the Big Bad for trying to save his Love Interest from becoming a human sacrifice, he goes to his teacher for help. Still under the effects of a powerful aphrodisiac, she seduces him, and they spend the night having sex.
-   In _Blue Drop_, some of the all-female race Arume run various girls' schools that double as their lesbian harems.
-   Played for Laughs in _Carnival Phantasm_'s _Tsukihime_ segments. Shiki's magic teacher, Aoko, has had the hots for him since he was a child while he's blissfully oblivious to the reason behind her nosebleedings. At the end of an episode, now a teenager, Shiki meets Aoko again and she reveals her plan was to groom Shiki into her ideal boyfriend. She declares it was a success and Shiki realizes Aoko was the sixth heroine all along.
-   _Chou Kuse ni Narisou_: Nagisa is chased by a homosexual male teacher who mistakes her for a boy.
-   _DearS_: Mitsuka-sensei is hot for anyone, meaning that ALL of her students have to deal with her teaching sexually-explicit foreign language lessons (that she wrote herself) while she's wearing nothing but skimpy lingerie. Even the male students find this more annoying than anything else.
-   In an episode of the Hentai _Discipline: the Record of a Crusade_, The Hero is tricked into being alone with the teacher that was tasked with testing his sexual prowess, but not allowed to do anything else with him.
-   In the _Full Metal Panic!_ manga, the Camp Gay substitute teacher for Sōsuke's high school's men's swim team is shown to have the hots for Sōsuke. Not that anyone can blame him. He is shown blushing and drooling over Sōsuke's body, and is very obviously jealous and shocked when he interprets Kaname's "I work well with Sōsuke because we have a bond" as being that they've done it. There's also an incident at the end of Ending Day by Day where Sōsuke tackles his regular teacher upon spotting a Laser Sight on her forehead. While in the anime she simply demands to know what's going on, in the manga and light novels she instead shouts, "You can't! People might see us!"
-   In _Futaba-kun Change!_, Sabuyama-sensei has a completely one-sided crush on the male Futaba and is disgusted when a female student with the same name as his beloved (actually the same person) joins the class.
-   In _Gokusen_, Evil Teacher Miura, however, falls for Shin. Busty teacher Fujiyama makes much of her lust for her hot students but we never actually see her do anything.
-   Referenced in _Haou Airen_. When Di Long tries to rape Kurumi, she protests and calls him "sensei." He realizes that she still thinks of him as her P.E. teacher, and concludes that this makes it even better, because "it'll be like doing something really naughty."
-   In _Haré+Guu Deluxe_ when Hare tries to cheer up his scary Mood swinging substitute teacher after her attempted relationship with his regular teacher fails, she turns her attention to him to Hare's horror.
-   Yukari-sensei in _Haruka Nogizaka's Secret_ is constantly throwing herself at her students and generally acting inappropriately... and the students want none of it.
-   _I'm Gonna Be an Angel!_: It may look like a one-sided crush (and sexual harassment) on Raphael's part, but the truth is Mikael is as hot for his teacher as his teacher is for him. (Mikael has just huge problems with self-denial.)
-   Played for Horror in Junji Ito's "Madonna". The (male) Evil Principal running an elite Catholic private girls' school takes an interest in the (teenage and female) lead, Maria, immediately attempting to groom her with praise and access to more exclusive classes and honors. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Unsurprisingly, Maria is just the latest in a long line of former students who the Principal groomed into becoming his lovers, only to discard them as they aged or lost their sanity from his constant Gaslighting. Despite being set amidst his expected Body Horror and Mind Screw setpieces, the realistic depiciton of child abuse makes this story one of Ito's more unsettling works.
-   _Lets Nupu Nupu_ features, amongst other randomness, a hot school nurse who acts like the grade school kid is the one who is molesting her when it's blatantly obvious she's the full-blown pedophile.
-   In _Loveless_, Soubi's teacher Ritsu gives him "lessons" (involving a whip) on how to take pain and goes on to take the boy's virginity. It's not portrayed positively.
-   _Mahoromatic_ uses this trope to a disturbing extent, especially in the first series, with a (perhaps) twenty-five-year-old teacher lusting after the middle-school-aged male lead; fortunately, this somewhat overused source of comedy is not as prevalent in the second series. The After the End finale shows the two meeting up some 8-10 years later. She comments how he's lost his looks, then walks off with a pair of preteen male students.
-   In _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, this is part of Professor Kozo Fuyutsuki's backstory, with him caring greatly for his student Yui Ikari, who married his _other_ student Gendou. His one-sided love for her remained secret for a long time, but when Fuyutsuki is turned into LCL during _End of Evangelion_ it is _Yui's_ face that he sees as he's about to die<small>◊</small>.
-   One of the _PandoraHearts_ OVA features a High School AU with Gilbert as a teacher and Oz as a student. Gilbert falls in Love at First Sight with Oz after a Crash-Into Hello when the former is running Late for School, complete with Crush Blush and Crush Filter as Gilbert sees Oz surrounded by Bishie Sparkle. Whether Oz reciprocates or merely enjoys messing with Gilbert is open to interpretation.
-   _Princess Tutu_ features a teacher (Neko-sensei) who threatens his delinquent female students (often the main character) with having to marry him. This is taken as a severe threat by everyone but the rare students who actually like him, whom he is deathly afraid of and avoids or turns down (the subversion). His actions are based on a Japanese myth, but it plays like a commentary on this trope. ... wasn't Neko-sensei a cat?
-   _Revolutionary Girl Utena_, in which it's a deliberate psychological ploy by the Big Bad to manipulate the Tragic Hero. Very Squicky.
-   Naruko Yokoshima, the only teacher ever seen in _Seitokai Yakuindomo_, is an unmarried Hard-Drinking Party Girl who's way too excited about former all-girl Ousai becoming co-ed. Her main victim is Takatoshi Tsuda, The One Guy, of whom she has high hopes liking older women. She has nearly taken advantage of him when she locked him up together with her in a room.
-   _Shoujo Sect: Innocent Lovers_: Ms. Hayato (age 27) tried to hide her feelings for her student, Momoko (age 16) since such relations would be improper. But after inviting Momoko to what was meant to be an innocent evening out to eat, she finally seizes the opportunity and takes her to a love hotel. Though initially surprised by it, Momoko consents and they spend the night making love to each other (SFW). Word of their relationship spread around campus, the following days, as several of Momoko's classmates had seen them leaving the hotel together. Thus, creating a scandal. However, it wasn't allowed to continue as Hayato's ailing health takes a sudden turn for the worse, which forced her to resign so she could be taken to a medical ward outside of Tokyo for treatment.
-   In _Yondemasu Yo Azazelsan_, Akutabe is heavily implied to be a _little_ too attached to Sakuma, who is both his apprentice and secretary. Azazel and Beelzebub also suspect his relationship with Sakuma might not be purely professional on his side. Of course, this is played for laughs, and she's is oblivious to it.
-   In _Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs_, Harumu, Kogarashi's homeroom teacher, falls in love with him. He doesn't return her feelings, however.

    Comic Books 

-   _Spider-Man_ - Professor Miles Warren was infatuated with his student Gwen Stacy, but refused to admit it, convincing himself that he saw her as the daughter he never had. Her death led to him becoming a supervillain and the story that would, decades later, be revived as The Clone Saga, thus proving that teachers falling for students can never lead to anything good.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   One of Professor X's deepest secrets was that he was in love with Jean Grey as a student. His Superpowered Evil Side, Onslaught, was all too happy to share this with her, much to Jean's horror.
    -   _Ultimate X-Men_'s version of Xavier is worse, having had relations with both Mystique and Emma Frost, who were his students at the time. Much like mainstream Xavier, he had romantic feelings for Jean as well.

    Fan Works

-   In the Marvel Cinematic Universe fic _Spider-Man: Finding Home_, events lead to Peter Parker becoming the intern to his college professor Doctor Catherine Connors (who Peter swiftly guesses is his world's version of Curt Connors), a one-armed woman working on refining the Extremis process to grant the accelerated healing without the accompanying superpowers. Catherine swiftly acknowledges that she is attracted to Peter, but assumes that he wouldn't be interested in a one-armed woman at least twice his age when he's already dating Kate Bishop, although she can't ignore the implications of her discovery that he's in a polyamorous relationship with at least three other women, one of whom (Yelena Belova) is close to Catherine's own age.

    Film — Live-Action

A teacher at girls' high school, middle-aged and married with a small daughter of his own, is madly in unrequited love with one of his teenage pupils and is heartbroken when she graduates. It's implied that years later the memory of his love is one of the things that drive him possibly crazy.
-   _Don't Think Twice_: Although it's a mutual attraction, it's heavily implied that the student Miles brings home from one of his improv classes at the beginning of the movie is not the first. Later in the movie, we get this gem:
    
    **Miles:** Fuck you, Lindsay.  
    **Lindsay:** You wouldn't, 'cause I'm not 22 and I'm not your student.

-   In Lindsay Anderson's _if.... (1968)_, a middle-aged chaplain and mathematics teacher at a boys' boarding school seems to take an interest in Jute, a pretty new boy in his class, probably 13 years old. The chaplain is skewered by Anderson's satire, as are most of the adults in the film.
-   _Le souffle au cœur_ (_Murmur of the Heart_). Laurent, 14 and a half, is in confession when his priest and teacher makes a pass at him. Laurent asks to go back to class.

However, during the private lessons, he later gives a convalescent Laurent nothing much, if anything, happens.
-   In _Pretty Persuasion_ Kimberly is very aware that Mr. Anderson is attracted to her and deliberately teases him. She then goes as far as to blame him for sexual harassment.
-   _The Squid and the Whale_: Bernard lusts after Lili, a student in the college class he teaches who writes "very racy" stories. She's substantially younger with him, and, in what would certainly be an HR violation today, moves in with him after she gets evicted. While she expresses some interest in him, when he eventually makes a pass at her it doesn't appear to be consensual.
-   _The Witch Files_: As a result of the coven casting a spell on Mr. Dwyer so Brooke can do no wrong in his eyes, he falls in love with her and propositions her, then resigns in horror at what he has done.

Jeremy agonizes over his sudden attraction to 14-year-old Max, one of his charges. Turns out that Jeremy's own former mentor Ruff and the camp director Charlie both have similar predilections, but unlike Jeremy have used the mentor role to force themselves on boys or coerce them into sex. Things are complicated by Jeremy's recollection that when he was 14, he desired the 50-something Ruff. There's a backstory in which, a few years ago, Jeremy had a friendship with a 13-year-old boy to whom he seems to have been subconsciously attracted.
-   It's implied that Komoe of _A Certain Magical Index_ has a crush on Touma.

This makes him support their love even more.
-   In _Durarara!!_, Prof. Nasujima has a rather obvious thing for his student Anri. In his case, however, it's more of an indication that he's a giant creep than a case of forbidden love (especially since it's implied that Anri is hardly his first in this regard). It's shown that his first relationship with a student was mutually consensual but seriously unhealthy, and he was the one to quit it since the girl was an even bigger creep than he, and he was seriously afraid for his safety.
-   In Alexander Chee's _Edinburgh_, a 12-year-old boy joins the Pine State Boys' Choir as a first soprano. Turns out that the choir director sexually mistreats the boys, going so far as to drug them in order to do so.
-   Roger Peyrefitte's _Les amitiés particulières_ (_Special Friendships_) is also set in a Jesuit school. One of the teacher-priests seems to fancy 14-year-olds Georges and Lucien, suggesting that they switch pajamas and the like.

He falls in love with 18-year-old Carleton, one of his students. Carleton is in love with another boy at the school and having a relationship with him that repeats much of what went on in Ashley's schoolboy love affair. He has no idea about Ashley's affections and is initially shocked and repulsed when he finds out but softens his opinion later. Some other men among the teachers at the school are also attracted to the boys and have little coteries. Amusingly, the chaplain has a taste for rather unwashed lads, whom he has to tea in his study. He keeps art of naked boys around, but never actually lays a finger on the real boys; their proximity is enough.
-   In Ursula Zilinsky's _Middle Ground_, the protagonist mentions in passing that at his boys' boarding school there was a swimming coach who carried on with the boys.
-   In _My Dark Vanessa_, 15-year-old Vanessa is groomed into a sexual relationship by her 42-year-old English teacher, Mr. Strane.
-   Deconstructed and depicted much more unsympathetically almost to the point of caricature in _Tampa_ by Alissa Nutting. The main character, Celeste, is a sociopathic 26-year-old who took up teaching solely because of her obsession for 14-year-old boys and deliberately seduces one. In the end, she's divorced and working as a hotel janitor, banned from areas with schools, and has to declare that she's a sexual predator after being released from prison.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Although never outright stated, the very fact that the supposedly sweet, seemingly wholesome Selena Coombs of _American Gothic (1995)_ is in fact a Femme Fatale, Hot Librarian, and Evil Teacher all rolled into one makes speculation about this trope inevitable.  
    One lost episode, however, does offer an aversion of this. In "The Potato Boy", Ms. Coombs invites Caleb to her house, all alone, for 'special tutoring' ...but once there, she ends up confessing her tragic past, crying in Caleb's lap, and taking comfort from him in a purely platonic if unexpected way, almost doing a Heel–Face Turn because of it. Actually a very touching, surprising bit of Character Development. (Which was then promptly forgotten about for the rest of the series.)
-   In _The Big Bang Theory_ the episode "The Hook-Up Reverberation", has a scene where Penny casually admits her high school PE coach turned out to have a close personal interest in her, which amounted to an unwise teacher-pupil crush. She took the young Penny to see a Melissa Etheridge gig, and Penny played along with the idea to ensure she got A-grades. Penny does not disclose how far she had to go to get those A's but casually says "it all worked out just fine".
-   One episode of _Boy Meets World_ has a Cool Teacher in the form of Fred Savage (Corey's Real Life older brother) - who winds up trying to sleep with Topanga, prompting Corey to assault him.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   The seventh-season episode "Him", in which a magic jacket casts love spells on half the female cast, making Buffy, Willow, Anya, and Buffy's little sister Dawn chase after the high school football hero, R.J.. Anya is hundreds of years older than the guy, but it's Buffy who follows this trope: she's a counselor at the school now, and before she tries to _kill the principal_ for her beloved, she gets him up on a desk with naughty things in mind... in time for her lovesick little sister to walk in and catch them (and for Xander to scold Buffy).
    -   Word of God states that Professor Maggie Walsh had feelings for Riley. Seeing as he views her more as a mother figure - and she's completely deranged - this is exceedingly creepy. It's even creepier when you remember that she was experimenting on Riley too. It was extra super creepy that she watched Buffy and Riley have sex from a video camera installed in his room, then decided to have Buffy killed off. Call that lady Queen Squick.
-   In _Caprica_, one of Clarice's her husbands asks her if the reason she invited Lacy to dinner was to make her another wife. It isn't; however, it's hinted that the reason he asked this is that she's done this before.
-   _Cold Case_: Incidents of teachers raping students come up a few times ("The Plan" and "Family"), but the killer in "Almost Paradise" comes closest to the "romance" part. He was an ephebophile<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  who never acted on his feelings, but he convinced himself that Felicia Grant was special and mature enough to actually have a real relationship with him. She rebuffs him when he tries to kiss her on prom night, prompting him to run her down.
-   _Colonel March of Scotland Yard_: A university professor's desire for one his students becomes a motive for murder in "The Case of the Misguided Missal".
-   _Dollhouse_. In "Belle Chose" a client who is a college professor pays for Echo to be imprinted with the personality of a Book Dumb college student who seduces him to improve her grade, presumably as a safe way of playing out a long-held fantasy. Things are going well until Echo's personality is accidentally swapped with that of a Serial Killer and the prof gets stabbed in the neck with a pencil.
-   In the British soap opera, _Hollyoaks_, secondary school teacher, Becca Dean falls in love and embarks on an affair with a teenage student, Justin Burton. Many years later the show repeated the storyline with Jen Gilmore and her student Tilly Evans.
-   _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_:
    -   One episode had a school _principal_ having sex with a 12-year-old student. It's eventually revealed that she had a brain tumor affecting her behavior; once the tumor is removed and she regains her normal ability to function, she's horrified by what she's done.
    -   Another episode had a teacher admitting to having sex with one of his students but claimed it was consensual while said student accused him of raping her (in this case, it's college, so there's no inherent age of consent issue). They never quite tell us if it was a case of Hot For Student or a mutual attraction, and ended it just before the verdict is read. This was intentional to show how ambiguous these cases are when it's only he said/she said (The episode went out of its way to include evidence for both sides and gave both of them moments that made them untrustworthy.) They later held an online poll to see how people would have ruled if they had been on the jury: Not Guilty was the winner.
    -   Another episode has a teacher who's blackmailing high-school students into having sex with her by threatning their grades. It ends up being a Red Herring on the main case they're investigating, but she's still implied to have been arrested for her actions.
    -   Yet another episode features a prep school that turned out to have had _multiple_ cases of teachers who were serial abusers of students that they essentially turned a blind eye to.
    -   There was also an episode of the original _Law & Order_ that had a male High School teacher getting arrested for having relations with one of his students. He's put through the normal wringer until it's revealed that the "student" was actually in her 20s and faking being a teenager due to an inability to face growing up.
-   Parodied in the _MADtv (1995)_ sketch "Pretty White Kids With Problems", of the Hot for Student variety with the French teacher.
-   In _Malcolm in the Middle_, Malcolm is convinced that Ms. Miller is coming on to him and is appropriately disturbed by it, although it is clear to the viewer that she mostly just has no sense of personal space and is obsessed with being "emotionally available" for her students. Malcolm and his brothers later exploit her "crush" on him to get out of trouble with their parents.
-   Canadian teen sitcom _Mr. Young_ has an unusual version of this. Title character Adam Young, the new science teacher at Finnegan High School, has a huge crush on one of his fifteen-year-old students named Echo. However, since Mr. Young is a child prodigy who graduated from University at age fourteen before returning to his home town to teach, he's actually the same age as Echo.
-   _Queen Sugar_:
    -   Nova used to be in a relationship with her professor until she decided to quit academia.
    -   Micah sleeps with one of his college professors, but when he tries to give her a gift on her birthday, she admits that she's only interested in sex. After that, he breaks off the relationship.
-   _Shakespeare & Hathaway - Private Investigators_: The Victim of the Week in "The Chameleon's Dish" is a school counselor who was having an affair with one of her students.
-   In Series 3 of _Skins_, Kieran makes an unsuccessful move on Naomi, his student.
-   The FX drama _A Teacher_ (adapted from the movie of the same name) is an entire series dedicated to a relationship between a female teacher and her male student, followed by the devastating fallout once the relationship is revealed. The show initially seems to portray the teacher in a broadly sympathetic light, but it eventually evolves to reveal that the affair had terrible consequences for the student's mental health and affected him for years afterward.
    -   Whether this qualifies as Hot for Student or Mutual Attraction is actually a source of debate within the show — in the series finale, the teacher attempts to apologize for letting the student pursue her, only for him to cut her off and point out that she arranged all of the romantic moments and accuse her of trying to avoid blame.
-   In _Veronica Mars_, Veronica defends one of her favorite teachers against a claim of this. She goes through the girl's diary, and checks the dates, and so gets him off. She then finds out that it was all true, and that the girl who said she was his lover was really a friend of the actual girl, and she did get pregnant and so wasn't in school. Veronica then got him fired.

    Music 

-   Referenced in the first verse of "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" by AC/DC: "You're having trouble with your high school head / He's giving you the blues / You wanna graduate, but not in his bed? / Here's what you gotta do..."
-   The song itself doesn't contain any hint of this, but the _video_ for Bonnie Tyler's "Total Eclipse of the Heart" casts her as a teacher at a boy's prep school, who has... interesting dreams about her students. Brilliantly parodied here.
-   "My Name Is" by Eminem: "My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high / the only problem was, my English teacher was a guy / I smacked him in his face with an eraser / chased him with a stapler / and stapled his nuts to a stack of papers".
    -   Later the lyrics were censored to: "My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high / thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35 / I smacked him in his face with an eraser / chased him with a stapler / and told him to change the grade on the paper". The following lines made it into the album release, though (only changed for the radio version).
-   The unequal power dynamic of this trope is pointed out in "29" by Demi Lovato.

    Webcomics

Later she realizes that her feelings for Squall were not romantic at all, causing her much embarrassment.
-   _Persona_:
    -   In _Persona 3_, one social link is with someone playing an online game, who turns out to be a teacher with a crush on one of her students. It turns out to be the protagonist's teacher, who has a crush on him; if you max the relationship out, then she eventually finds out that she was talking to you all along, panics when the realization hits her and awkwardly asks you out on a date before quickly taking it back. It never goes any further than this...
    -   _Persona 4_ features homeroom teacher Noriko Kashiwagi, an Old Maid with so little self-esteem that she organizes a high-school beauty pageant with the sole intention of entering it herself and crushing the other contestants. Later on, while the guys are staying over at Yukiko's hotel, then accidentally stumble upon Kashiwagi and Hanako crying over their loss, who upon seeing the boys immediately throw themselves at them. Cue screams of horror from everyone save for Teddie, who's ready to go.
    -   In _Persona 5_, a highly squicky variant is featured in the gym teacher Suguru Kamoshida, who sexually harasses his students and lusts after Ann Takamaki. He represents Lust of the Seven Deadly Sins, and it's your job to steal his heart and purge the evil within so that he answers for his crimes.
-   _Shamelessly Slutty School Teacher_ is about a high school history teacher and her attempts to seduce a rather dim male student.
-   In _World of Warcraft_, Stalvan Mistmantle has one-sided feelings for his female student. The age gap is never quantified, but he claims that he's only a few years older than she is, while she refers to him as an old man. His feelings are not reciprocated and are portrayed as an obsession that turns him evil and leads him to kill her and her lover.
-   Unusual for an H-Game, in _X-Change 2_ you not only don't get to see _any_ naked pics of the hot teacher, but you end up getting sex forced upon you by the new _male_ professor who does this thing a lot.

    Visual Novels 

-   There's a rather Squicky example in _Atlach=Nacha_. Iguchi-sensei is the swim coach for Genki Girl Watanabe Tsugumi. He also happens to stalk her and attempts to rape her. Things don't end well when the main character shows up...
-   In _The Fruit of Grisaia_, Chizuru has an obvious crush on the protagonist despite being ten years older, which he mostly ignores except when flattering her so she'll follow whatever weird idea he has. In _The Labyrinth of Grisaia_ and _The Eden of Grisaia_ she gets a bit more acknowledgment in the bonus H section, though in _Labyrinth_ it's just jokes at her expense.

    Web Animation 

-   _ETU - Animated Stories_: Cameron's high school teacher Jenny crushes on him, despite the fact that he is married. After he rejects her advances, she ruins his marriage so that he will move into her house.

    Western Animation 

-   One episode of _Archie's Weird Mysteries_ played this for laughs when Mrs. Grundy, turned back into a teenager by exposure to space rock chemicals, develops a crush on Reggie. Reggie ends up freaking out about the whole thing. When he finally does start coming around to the idea, that's when Dillon manages to reverse the effect, much to both their surprise.
-   In the _Daria_ episode "Lucky Strike", one of the substitute teachers clearly has a weird attraction to Tiffany, though she (and apparently everyone in her class) is too dense to realize it. He spends the whole class talking about the novel he's trying to write (which happens to be about an older man and a "budding woman-child") and has Tiffany act out parts of the book; apparently he even stroked her hair. When Helen gets word she complains to Ms. Li, who gets Daria to teach the class instead.
    
    **Ms. Li:** If someone asked me to teach a class, I'd be honored. Besides, we wouldn't be in this fix if it weren't for your mother.
    
    **Daria:** Yeah. Hire one pedophile and she gets all bent out of shape.
    
-   In the _Dexter's Laboratory_ episode "Dexter Detention", Miss Wimple seems a little bit _too_ affectionate towards Dexter. She faints when errs even so slightly.
-   In _Rick and Morty_, Mr. Goldenfold harbors an attraction to Morty's sister Summer that is so deeply repressed that it only manifests in a dream within a dream.

### Mutual Attraction

    Anime & Manga 

-   Many a hentai Doujinshi has this as a plot. A noteworthy example is the mini-series done by the Doujin Artist Jun. The first chapter involves a Delinquent schoolgirl giving the male teacher a really hard time. And as it's a porn doujin it winds up them having sex. The second chapter is them having sex behind the entire school back and the teacher is worried that someone will find out while the student says they're safe. It then cuts to the classroom with the student wondering where they are and another saying the two of them are on a date.
-   Subverted in _½ Prince_. Gui refuses to start a relationship with Lan once he finds out that she is actually Prince. He waits until the day she graduates and proposes to her.

-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_:
    -   Rentarou's thirteenth girlfriend is his Japanese teacher, Nadeshiko Yamato (or Naddy, as she prefers to be known).
    -   His twenty-first girlfriend is the school's ethics teacher, Momoha Bonnouji.
-   _Black Bird (2006)_ has a relationship between the main character, Misao, and her teacher, Kyo.
-   One of the cruelest versions of this trope is showcased in _Bokurano_. Chizuru (who's fourteen _tops_) and Hatagai-sensei's relationship was so horrible that she broke down and ended up becoming a full-fledged Yandere. Depending on whether it's the anime or manga, he either used her and ran off after she got pregnant or let her friends rape her and ran off after she got pregnant.
-   Another cruel version of this trope occurs in _Boy's Abyss_. The protagonist Keiji starts a sexual relationship with his homeroom teacher Yuri Shibasawa, but she quickly becomes a yandere Evil Teacher who does everything in her power to keep him all to herself, from stalking to trying to alienate him from his other loved ones. She even calls a parent-teacher conference to subtly tell his _mother_ to back off.
-   _Boys Empire_: In chapter 7, Makoto finds out that his best friend, Ikki, has secretly been banging Ms. Akiko, who's the School Nurse. Ikki even talks her into letting Makoto and Hitomi use one of the beds in her office so they can finish what they started earlier that morning - while he and Ms. Akiko get it on, themselves.
-   _Cardcaptor Sakura_:
    -   The manga features a fourth grade teacher giving his student an engagement ring — and portraying the relationship as wholesome and innocent. It was bowdlerized in the anime, with the girl simply having a Precocious Crush on the teacher and him being Oblivious to Love.
    -   Sakura's parents fit in since her father Fujitaka married Nadeshiko, who was a student in the school he taught at, and married her when she was sixteen. It was only his first year as a teacher, and since Nadeshiko was in high school, they weren't too far apart.
    -   Touya's relationship with teacher Kaho Mizuki is an aversion, as they only confessed to loving each other after Kaho's term as student teacher had ended.
    -   In the dubbed version of the first OVA, Clow Reed had a relationship with a student of his, until she turned to The Dark Side, and he sealed her away in an alternate dimension. (In the original, he didn't actually have a relationship with her, and she was more The Rival than anything else.)
-   _Ceres, Celestial Legend_ features a minor plot involving Yuki Urakawa, a girl who's in a relationship with her science teacher. Though it turns out that he's just using her to test out the drug that awakens the latent powers of the descendants of celestial maidens.
-   In _Chobits_, a secondary main character (the protagonist's friend), ends up marrying off their Cram School teacher saving her from a shaky relationship with her husband. Though in this case, he was an 18-19 Rōnin and she was in her mid-twenties and therefore this wasn't as iffy as usual for a CLAMP case of this trope.
-   In _Ciel ~The Last Autumn Story~_, one begins to develop between the main character, Yvienne, and her teacher, Krohiten.
-   Kouko and Yoshino from _CLANNAD_, though they only started to seriously pursue a relationship long after Yoshino graduated.
-   _Domestic Girlfriend_:
    -   Natsuo is in love with his high school teacher Hina. And it's strongly hinted that she has feelings for him too. What makes it even more complicated is the fact that they become step-siblings when their parents marry each other. They do eventually start dating each other, and in the manga finale, they marry each other.
    -   Hina's on the other side of this as well. At the beginning of the series she has been having an affair with her own high school teacher Shuu Hagiwara, who is married to another woman, for two years. They didn't get together until after she met him again later when she was in college, however.
-   In _Faster Than a Kiss_, 16-year-old Kaji Fumino and her teacher, 24-year-old Ojiro Kazuma actually _get married_ pre-book. It's explained that Fumino and her four-year-old brother are orphans, and are tired of being passed around to relatives. She and her teacher end up in a quick spat where she challenges him and says, "Then, can you marry me and take care of us?!" He takes her seriously and they end up married. As the book progresses, they both grow to seriously fall in love with each other.
-   In _Fruits Basket_, Tohru's mother Kyoko ended up marrying Katsuya, her student teacher from middle school - although they at least waited until Kyoko had graduated middle school and Katsuya had left that position before beginning a romantic relationship. It's implied Katsuya would have taken things a trifle slower if Kyoko's parents hadn't thrown her out of the house.
-   The Hentai _Fuzzy Lips_ revolves around a girl who ran away from home and is shacking up with her teacher. Though he feels conflicted about their relationship, he admits, to himself at least, that he is attracted to her, with the implication that she may have similar feelings.
-   In the manga, _Gakuen Alice_ shows Mikan Sakura's parents, Izumi and Yuka are an example of this. Izumi was a teacher at the academy from the time Yuka was in elementary school. The attraction was eventually mutual and was particularly _developed_ when she was in high school.
-   _The Garden of Words_. A high school student skipping classes comes across a mysterious older woman sheltering under a gazebo in the park. The two of them keep meeting their throughout the rainy season and grow attracted to each other (though it's not consummated in any way). Then the student finds out she was a teacher at his school who had to leave after a student fell for her and the student's angry girlfriend started spreading rumors they were having a relationship out of revenge. This revelation nearly ends the relationship. In the end, the two decide they have helped each other but they need to go their separate ways, though it's implied the student will seek her out once he becomes older.
-   In _The Gentlemen's Alliance_, Ushio and the school doctor Senri end up together.
-   In _Gokusen_, one of the series-long arcs is delinquent Bishōnen student Shin falling hard for nerdy yakuza-heir teacher Kumiko and he ends up with her in the end, though it's after he graduates. She is completely and utterly unaware of his feelings until he outright confessed after his graduation; in the meantime (due to his unswerving devotion, maturity, and him genuinely being a good fit for her personality-wise) not only did everyone else in their lives know about it, including his friends, her grandfather and yakuza True Companions, and even the Principal of the high school, everyone shipped it. Due to the length of the anime and j-drama (especially due the revolving cast of the latter), the arc was somewhat more subtle but still there.
-   In _GTO: The Early Years_, Ryuji and Eikichi begin the series by failing to hook up with two hot girls at a resort. When they get back, they find out the girls, Mariko and Ayumi, are their new teachers. Eikichi never scores with Mariko, but Ryuji and Ayumi fall for each other and even get married. She leaves town the next day after realizing she should let him have a normal teenage life.
-   _Hayate the Combat Butler_ we get a hint that something could have happened between Yukiji and her foster father had Hinagiku and her's parents hadn't abandoned them. He used to be her teacher and is said to still favor her.
-   _I My Me! Strawberry Eggs_ likewise offers the promise of a happy ending several years later after the girl in question has matured a little.
-   _Ichigo no Gakkou_ plays it for drama and deconstructs the concept. Teacher Ichigo Oomiya and student Kurumi start a relationship in high school, and the latter ends pregnant. The two end up keeping the child and do love each other genuinely, but it's not without consequences; Ichigo gets fired, Kurumi's friend initially feels betrayed because the latter knew the former had a crush on Ichigo, both of the couple's parents had a hard time adjusting, and they raise the question of keeping the child and dropping Kurumi out of school or aborting the child and letting Kurumi continue schooling. She's even shown to be wistful of the school life she could have had, even though she does love her family as is now.
-   _I'm Gonna Be an Angel!_ has Raphael and Mikael - believe it or not, it's not as squicky as it sounds, although they are also angels, which may make it sound even worse. And it's consensual on both parties (Mikael may have problems admitting it, though)
-   _Kiss x Sis_: Keita's teacher, Ms. Yuuzuki, initially wanted to put a stop to his incestuous affair with his twin sisters, but found herself growing fonder of him instead. She even begins to fantasize about him while masturbating, which soon becomes a habit for her. Keita also finds himself becoming attracted to her as well and the two eventually start dating in secret, though it isn't long before Ako and Riko become aware of it. Which setup the Love Triangle between them and Ms. Yuuzuki for Keita's affections, until Yuuzuki finally realizes Keita lacked ambition and breaks up with him in chapter 109.
-   _The Lion and the Bride_ is about a high school student who falls in love with and marries her teacher after her last remaining family dies.
-   In the classic manga/anime _Maison Ikkoku_, the beautiful widow Otonashi Kyoko née Chigusa successfully married her high school teacher, Otonashi Soichiro. Sadly, her husband died a few months after their wedding.
-   _Marmalade Boy_ plays this trope straight with the relationship between Miki's best friend Meiko Akizuki and her teacher Shinichi Namura, though they met and started their relationship _before_ he was her teacher. (She was excited to find out she'd be in his class, while he told her it would mean they couldn't be seen together in public anymore.) Also one of the few times a match up like this is portrayed in a sympathetic manner, specially due to the crap they go through. And they _do_ get Happily Married by the end of the series — the last episode of the anime series features their wedding party.
-   Sensei and Ninomiya-kun, the Show Within a Show of _Minami-ke_. A major example of Stylistic Suck as well, with the 'relationship' mainly involving the principal characters shouting each other's names while in utterly cliched soap opera settings.
-   As the title suggests, this is the basis of the plot for _My Wife is a High School Girl_. Student Asami and teacher Kyosuke marry and have to keep their relationship a secret to outsiders. Hilarity Ensues in one episode when a woman who was told they were siblings spies on them and ends up getting an even worse idea. Also, Asami's father's response to the marriage is to make them sign a Jail Bait Wait contract until she finishes school.
-   In _Nabari no Ou_, Tobari is in a Common Law Marriage with Hanabusa Seki. According to the guidebook, Hanabusa was Tobari's teacher in his senior year of high school.
-   Played with in _No Bra_ where Mizutani-sensei has started throwing herself at Masato not because she has feelings for him or actually wants him, but because she doesn't want to get kicked out of the apartment (she's been freeloading there under the pretense of keeping an eye on Masato and Yuki) and knows Masato has trouble saying no to a girl if she's getting physical with him.
-   _Please Teacher!_:
    -   Pictured above: The _raison d'etre_ of the anime. With the justification that the main character had a strange medical condition that, at one point, left him in a coma long enough that his body didn't age for three years - leaving him chronologically 18 though mentally (and physically) still 15. This is less of a justification for the age difference (Mizuho's age being undisclosed), and more to enable Kei to marry and live with Mizuho legally. Ironically, the issue seems less about the age difference and more about her being Kei's teacher, making their romance an awkward situation the two are called upon to conceal as it is a breach of the school's professional propriety.
    -   In a humorous twist, after Kei confirms his "marriage" to the principal, the principal reveals his own romance with a former student to them, leading both Kei and Mizuho to wonder whether it was entirely legal. Their wondering aloud about the girl's age, however, has the principal coughing at their moral inconsistency, prompting them not to inquire into the matter any further.
    -   It's implied at the end of the anime that Koishi is also starting to get romantically involved with her teacher Yamada-sensei.
-   _Queen's Blade_: Irma once had a relationship with her former instructor and ex-lover, Echidna. A flashback showed they used to sleep with each other, during Irma's training days; making them two of the few canonically lesbian characters in the series.
-   _Ranma ½_: Ranma and Hinako are accused of having this type of relationship a lot. At one point, the entire school thought he has molested her on multiple occasions. (It probably doesn't help that they saw him grope her breast and say, "Let me touch you!") And later on, they are caught in bed with him on top of her. Seriously though, it's not what it looks like. Ukyō lampshades this trope at one point.
    
    **Akane:** What's there to worry about? She's his teacher, right?  
    **Ukyō:** You're so naive. This sweet yet dangerous elixir of forbidden love between teacher and student soon becomes a drug so powerful neither of them can live without it.  
    **Akane:** N- Nonsense.
    
-   Played frighteningly dark in _Revolutionary Girl Utena_ where Big Bad Akio Ohtori is a blatant sexual predator who manipulates and seduces his students, both male and female, into having sex with him and then if they say anything to him afterwards he tries to put the blame on them saying it was "their choice" to fall for him. Some of them are as young as 13. This includes his own sister. He had even been grooming Utena Tenjou since she was 7. Squick indeed.
-   _Semelparous_: As a rookie Bulwark, Yorino is partnered to Unit 3 captain Youko for seasoning. The two women fall hard for each other and become a terrifyingly effective Battle Couple.
-   Kazuki Yamato of _Sensei Lock On_ has crushed on Kyouko Kadokura since the day she became his teacher... in fourth grade. He swore when he grew up he'd make her his bride. Kyouko didn't think much of this, seeing only a Precocious Crush. Fast forward ten years, Yamato is twenty and in university, Kyouko is thirty-three, and he proposes to her. They settle as boyfriend and girlfriend and much of the series' events is Kyouko fretting about the age gap, particularly since she tends to enter "teacher mode" when interacting with him, while simultaneously being charmed by his sincerity.
-   The Romantic Comedy manga _Sensei wa Koi o Oshierarenai_ has this as the central premise. It is about a lazy high school student and his Stern Teacher who fell in love and are secretly dating after school hours. Beyond trying to keep their relationship a secret, it is made more difficult by the fact the teacher, Rinko Yoshitaka, feels she has the moral obligation not to get too physical until he's older and graduates. Nothing more than hugs are allowed, something they both struggle with.
-   _Serial Experiments Lain_: In one of the later episodes, Alice is shown masturbating while fantasizing about her teacher. By the final episode, she's older and married to him.
-   In _Speed Grapher_, 33-years-old Intrepid Reporter Tatsumi Saiga starts as a mentor figure to 15-year-old Kagura Tennouzou, and teaches her about the outside world since up until few she was a _very_ sheltered Ojou who knew nothing about anything outside her house, her school... and a certain "club" where she was horribly abused and Saiga rescued her from. And the saddest/worst/best/whatever thing is that, considering the horrifying Crapsack World they live in, this is actually the _best_ relationship they have in their whole lives. And it's ultimately what _saves_ her life.
-   The central relationship in _Suki A Like Story_, also by CLAMP, is teacher-student as well.
-   In _Teacher's Pet_, Misuzu-sensei ends up having sex with her fifteen-year-old student, Masahiro. Who is also the younger brother of her co-worker and boyfriend. Oops.
-   In _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann — Gurren Academy_, a manga Alternate Universe of _Gurren Lagann_, Dayakka and Kiyoh serve as this.
-   _This Boy Suffers From Crystallization_: It starts off one-sided, with high school student Ayumi Tamari having a crush on his geology teacher, Kouya Onihara, who bluntly turns him down. At the climax, Kouya reveals that he loves Ayumi too, but refuses to pursue a relationship until after he graduates.
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul_, it's eventually revealed that Akira Mado was the result of such a relationship. Her mother was an instructor at the Academy and ended up married to one of her students. That's right, Kureo Mado was the younger half of the couple.
-   A high school romance is the main storyline of the Korean comic _Unbalance × Unbalance_. It has the younger male student and the older female teacher dynamic. It's more of a Will They or Won't They? thing so far, but still. There's also Les Yay version of this in the manhwa.
-   One of the alternate endings of _We Never Learn_ has the Ship Tease between now-graduated Nariyuki and his former teacher Mafuyu Kirisu (which during the main story when he was still in school had been played for laughs) now get treated completely seriously and results in them getting married.
-   This is the underlying premise of _Why the Hell Are You Here, Teacher!?_. Each volume of the Manga usually revolves around at least one teacher-student pairing getting into sexually suggestive situations, but ultimately they solidify their relationship at the end of their arc. It's basically this trope running on Rule of Sexy Played for Laughs.
-   _Wolf Guy - Wolfen Crest_:
    -   Hot Teacher Akiko Aoshika slowly develops feelings for Inugami Akira, the Badass Werewolf who enters her life. This would be entirely normal except for the fact that she's already divorced and he's fifteen. As a Seinen piece, this is actually played for drama and Aoshika finds the source of her defensiveness of the boy just as disturbing to her as it would be to child services. Not that it'll stop her in the end, most likely. Inugami eventually makes her his Morality Chain and comes to return her feelings, though the Anguished Declaration of Love doesn't come until Haguro Dou, the son of the local yakuza boss and a monster of the first order who is Yandere for Inugami in a big way, gets his hands on her and puts her through one of the most horrifying gang-rape sequences of recent manga with the help of his men. The result is the biggest Roaring Rampage of Rescue in the series.
    -   Another case comes from the Back Story: Inugami's own parents. Tetsuya Inugami was a uni professor in the USA and he married his pupil Lois, who also was a werewolf.
-   One arc of _The World God Only Knows_ features a Hot-Blooded student teacher as the girl Keima has to woo over. She actually becomes interested in him _before_ becoming Keima's next target, as she wants to break through his troubling personality and gaming hobby to reform him as a student. The difficulty he encounters is changing her interest into this trope.
-   _Yes! Precure 5_ has Coco and Nozomi. Nozomi is a middle school student, and Coco is her teacher. Oh, and he's actually a small extradimensional creature resembling a plush tanuki (and Nozomi is fully aware of this from the day they met). This romance is portrayed as not being unusual in any way, and nobody ever questions it.
-   _YuruYuri_ throws some pretty blatant hints that Rise Matsumoto and Nishigaki-Sensei have...something going on between the two of them.

    Comic Books 

-   Alison Bechdel's autobiographical graphic novel _Fun Home_ centered around her closeted gay father, a high school English teacher who over the years had affairs with his students and at one point underwent a trial for buying beer for one of them. She noted that though the offense was for buying alcohol for minors, the real offense "dare not speak its name." As Bechdel is a lesbian herself, she at one point wonders how she would have fared if she came of age in the repressive '50s like her father did... "Would I have had the guts to be one of those Eisenhower-era butches? Or would I have married and sought succor from my high school students?"
-   _Harleen_: Harleen once had an affair with her professor in college, and the two were also caught having sex together. Given this, she gained a false reputation for sleeping her way to the top, though she really earned her degree through hard work and talent (he didn't give her help).
-   In _New X-Men: Academy X_, Josh Foley aka "Elixir" has a secret relationship with Rahne "Wolfsbane" Sinclair, who is one of the youngest teachers at the Institute (being only 19, to Josh's 16). What was really disturbing about it was that Josh had a not-secret girlfriend his own age (Laurie Collins aka "Wallflower") _at the same time._
-   The title character of _Skim_ gets into a lesbian relationship with her art teacher, but as far as we know, it never gets past the kissing. The teacher is deeply troubled by it and gets herself transferred to another school.

    Fan Works 

-   _Apex Predator_ reveals that OC Veela Genevieve helped Apolline (Fleur's mother) seduce their transfiguration professor when both were students at Beauxbataons.
-   Back on Earth, this is how the relationship is done between Ben Tennyson and Tia Harribel becomes in _Bleach: Ultimate Alien_. However, it's Played With. Harribel was already in love with Ben back on Hueco Mundo with Ben later reciprocating, and Ben's mother approved the job (which Kevin helped with by forging credentials) so as to make sure Ben doesn't slack off. To make sure that they don't get caught when the two go on a date, Ben uses an ID Mask to turn into Ben 10,000.
-   Consonance and Dissonance, is about a relationship between Kurt and Blaine, while Blaine is Kurt's college professor. The age difference between them is only about four years, but since they're teacher and student they have to keep their relationship secret until Kurt is finished with the classes that Blaine teaches.
-   In the _Discworld_ fics of A.A. Pessimal, Assassins' School teacher Miss Alice Band has a relationship of this sort with her student Jocasta Wiggs. Although severely tempted, Alice controlled herself and only initiated the relationship when Jocasta had graduated and was therefore an adult and professional equal. Jocasta did signal her willingness when she was still a pupil, though. Which caused her teacher some angst.
-   Happens to Chisa Yukizome in _Everyday Life with Ultimate Girls_ when she falls for Makoto Naegi. However, it's Downplayed since Chisa's (who is only four years older than Makoto<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , averting a severe Age-Gap Romance) feelings are more romantic than sexual in nature, as it was Makoto's kindness and willingness to help her and her students that made her get interested in him. When he helps her after she suffers a Broken Pedestal moment with Kyosuke Munakata and ends up drunk, his loyalty, willingness to help her, and refusal to take advantage of the situation leads to her becoming part of his harem. That being said, she isn't unwilling to use her more mature body to try and tempt him, and she is one of the more actively seductive members of the group, and Makoto does find her incredibly attractive and even flirts with her playfully, such as calling her "Goddess of Hope's Peak Academy".
-   In _Fate Unown_, Delia and Professor Oak have been in a committed relationship for a decade now. They keep it a secret from everyone, even their son Ash because Delia became pregnant when he was still Professor Oak's student.
-   Any _Harry Potter_ WIKTT (When I Kissed The Teacher) fic. They revolve around Hermione and Severus.
-   Not a mutual example, but examples of each direction appear in _Hivefled_. Equius is unaware his teacher is making caliginous advances to him, and Eridan's attempt to seduce his teacher went unnoticed. They both assumed that this was what was happening with Gamzee and his teacher. They were wrong.
-   In _Lady Luck's Favor_, both Penelope Spectra and Desiree (who has become the new history teacher at Danny's school) become Danny's "fuck-buddies". They're both deeply in love with them, and he clearly finds them both attractive.
-   Played with in the _Merlin_/_Lost Girl_ crossover fic _Lost in Camelot_, as Merlin is persuaded by Morgana to teach her more about magic (even if he hides the fact that he possesses magic himself), which leads to the two becoming closer (much to Merlin's discomfort, as he is already in a relationship with Bo until Bo's friend Kenzi suggest they resolve the dilemma by becoming a triad).
-   Very heavily implied in _X-Men_ fanfic _Mutatis Mutandis_, between teacher Wolverine and teenage student Northstar. It's on several instances and first indicated when Northstar and his friends are greeting the new student. Later, the new student notices Wolverine watching Northstar as he works out.
-   There are many fics in the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fandom detailing a romance between Twilight Sparkle and Princess Celestia. Two of the best are _Eternal_ and _Composure_.
-   In _Phases of the Moon_, Princess Luna's last relationship before becoming Nightmare Moon was with her first apprentice, Nevermore. It did not end well.
-   Features in the _Harry Potter_ fanfic _The Power of Seven_ for at least two of the seven girls in Harry's 'harem';
    -   Harry starts trying to befriend Susan Bones by offering her pointers in Defence Against the Dark Arts, with Susan offering to return the favour if he needs help with Charms, Harry noting that she’s a better tutor than Hermione as she can break the subject down more easily.
    -   Demelza Robbins has a certain ‘kink’ for this kind of relationship that Harry uses while giving her flying lessons at the start of their relationship, as well as subsequent post-training 'conversations', to the point that Demelza refers to Harry as 'Captain' and gets particularly turned on when he calls her a 'good girl' before they become sexually active.
    -   While teacher/student isn't a major part of their dynamic, Luna comments at one point that she finds Harry to be a better teacher than Snape, as she asked both if there was such a thing as a sex-change potion and found Snape's answer inadequate while Harry observed that Polyjuice could be useful for such a desire.
-   In _Professor Riddle's Chronicles_, where Voldemort gets his coveted teaching job at Hogwarts, he and Bellatrix are attracted to each other but he tells her to wait until she finishes school (it helps that he is reluctant to acknowledge his feelings because he is determined to disprove Dumbledore's theory of the strength of The Power of Love). However, eventually they start dating in the summer after her sixth year.

-   Played for squick in the _Young Justice_ oneshot _Therapy_. Kid Flash flirts with his adult mentor Black Canary, but it's when she starts flirting _back_ that things get weird. KF likes to flirt for fun and doesn't actually mean anything with his behavior. Black Canary doesn't buy it and tries to force herself onto him. This confuses Kid Flash because he _is_ attracted to her, but won't consent because there are so many things wrong with the situation (she's already in a relationship, she's his teacher, there's nearly a decade age-gap between them, she's an adult, etc). In the end, Artremis walks in at the right moment and stops Black Canary. As it turned out, Black Canary had been hit with a virus on a mission, which explained her out-of-character behavior.

    Film — Animated 

-   _Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper_: Anneliese and Julian, respectively a princess and her tutor, are in love despite Anneliese's betrothal to King Dominick. The power dynamic factor is somewhat mitigated by the fact they're both young and seem close in age, and they clearly have a close personal friendship outside of being student and teacher.
-   _Ratatouille_: Colette is assigned to teach Linguini how to properly work in the kitchen. She doesn't take kindly to him first, but when he actually listens to her advice and takes her seriously, she warms up to him.

    Film — Live-Action

-   Invoked by Carla when she sets to to seduce Álex in _The Body (2012)_.
-   In _Cracks_, a group of girls at a boarding school all seem to be crushing on their teacher (played by Eva Green). It gets creepy, though, when the teacher shows affection for the new girl - who is clearly NOT interested.

-   In _The Hand_, Jon has an affair with his student Stella while teaching at community college.
-   Tree and professor Gregory Butler in _Happy Death Day_. He even threatens her grade in his class when she dumps him, to which she replies "Already dropped it", while giving him a farewell one-finger salute over her shoulder as she walks away.
-   The Australian movie _The Heartbreak Kid 1993_ revolves around a male student and a female teacher falling for each other while setting up a high school soccer team. Unlike many examples, the two are fairly close in age and both over the (Australian) age of consent (he's 18 and in his final year of high school, she's 22 and fresh out of university), which tends to alleviate the Squick factor inherent in this trope somewhat, if not necessarily the ethical concerns. The teacher quits her job before she can be fired, and decides to pursue further education herself, with the pair promising to meet again in two years.
-   College student Rain and her professor Gabe share a mutual attraction in _Husbands and Wives_ - age difference aside, they seem quite compatible, but he ends up turning her down after a kiss, for fear of a karmic punishment of sorts.
-   _Il sapore del grano_ (_The Flavor of Corn_). Lorenzo, a university student doing a year's teaching, develops a romantic friendship with twelve-year-old Duilio, one of the boys in his class. The Lover and Beloved dynamic is both invoked and subverted. Duilio teaches Lorenzo to drive a tractor and identify trees and offers him the simple affection which Lorenzo, who lacks a family and whose sexual relationships with women are emotionally unsatisfying, needs. When Lorenzo's girlfriend, seeing a postcard from Duilio, asks if he's one of Lorenzo's pupils, Lorenzo says, "No, he's the one who taught me everything I know."

-   15-year-old Trish "the Dish" in _Mallrats_ is sleeping with dozens of men, including some teachers, as part of a research project.
-   Played for Laughs in _Mean Girls_, where the high school coach is revealed to have been having affairs with several attractive Asian students. Cue huge catfight when the different girls find this out. The girls involved also speak zero English, making the scene even stranger.
    -   That being said, this example is viewed rather unfavorably in universe; the coach is portrayed as a creep even though the girls both like him back. At one point, the principal angrily storms up to him with a bat and warns him to "step away from the underage girls", prompting the coach to book it and disappear for the rest of the film, with the implication that the police are after him.
-   Technically it's a sports coach rather than a teacher, but the relationship between Neil and his coach in _Mysterious Skin_ has strong elements of this. Neil looks back on the experience positively at first but eventually realizes he was used, and the coach himself is a Depraved Homosexual who doesn't seem to care one way another about consent. (Please note that Neil, at the time, isn't even capable of consenting, seeing as he is _eight years old._)
-   In _Never Been Kissed_, Drew Barrymore's character's teacher gets a thing for her... good thing she's actually an undercover newspaper reporter in her late 20s. When the teacher finds out, he's equal parts confused, angry, and relieved.
-   In _Night School (1981)_, Professor Millett has had affairs with numerous of his students and is living with his research assistant.
-   _Notes on a Scandal_, starring Judi Dench, has this in all directions. The protagonist's new friend, a married woman with two kids of her own, falls for a delinquent. Things go badly. Interestingly, when said woman was herself a young student (though slightly less young) she became involved with her older professor, who then became her husband. Even the relationship with the protagonist, if not quite teacher/student, is younger/mentor.
-   _The Novice_: Alex and Dani, her TA, flirt before having sex later. Dani won't actually date her when she's teaching Alex however, only doing so after she's not in her class.
-   Both _The Nutty Professor (1963)_ and its remake have a college professor developing a romance with a graduate student, with some Jekyll & Hyde antics in-between.
-   In _The Pelican Brief_, the main character is dating one of her law professors. We're apparently supposed to forgive this gross violation of ethics because she's a brilliant student and doesn't need an unfair advantage to get an A.
-   _Perfect Addiction_: Sienna began dating Jax while she'd been training him. After they broke up, she began training Kayden as she's very tempted by him as well. They at last admit their feelings for each other and become lovers. Her mentor Julian forbids this, and knows at once after they've become involved. They put their relationship on hiatus when he's discovered this to keep on training in his gym.
-   _Pretty Maids All in a Row_ is less "teacher-student romance" and more "teachers and students screwing each other because it's The '70s and everything is OK." Sexy new teacher Betty Smith becomes a Mrs. Robinson for Ponce, the sexually frustrated young hero.
-   In _Ripper: Letter from Hell_, Molly and Professor Kane have sex after bonding over their shared experience of both having escaped from Serial Killers. It is later revealed that Professor Kane was the one who had sex with Marissa at the party before she was murdered.

-   _Stealing Heaven_: The plot of the film, between the teacher Peter Abelard and student Héloïse.
-   In _That's My Boy_, starring Adam Sandler, the lead character had an affair with his female teacher, which resulted in a son. The main character is in _middle school_ at the time, and the incident isn't so much played for laughs as it is a victorious wish-fulfillment fantasy.
-   A flashback in _What's New Pussycat?_ shows chronic womanizer Michael (Peter O'Toole) had a crush on his teacher, which was more of a full-on affair. Squick level is either toned down or heightened as O'Toole plays himself as a youth, in schoolboy uniform.
    
    **Teacher:** Oh, Michael, this can't work. I'm 34 and you're 12!  
    **Michael:** Don't be negative!
    

    Literature 

-   The _Baccano!_ light novels suggest that the mother of Huey's children is his former alchemy teacher, Renee.

-   In _Boot Camp_, fifteen-year-old Garrett has been in a relationship with his math teacher Sabrina, who is eight years older than he is. His parents got her fired, but they didn't press statutory rape charges because they were embarrassed that their son was dating a teacher and didn't want anyone to find out. Garrett kept seeing her, even sneaking out to spend the night at her apartment. That's the main reason his parents decided to send him to Lake Harmony.
-   Barry Lyga's novel _Boy Toy_ subverts this trope as the main plot. The main character seduced an attractive female teacher at a very young age and has to deal with the legal, social, and psychological consequences when everyone in town finds out. It's revealed to be even more twisted at the end when said teacher tells him she intentionally seduced him, and intended to from the moment she first saw him. For the five years following that, the main character was convinced that _he_ seduced _her_, and that all the resulting consequences were entirely his fault. Nevermind the fact that the teacher had already made moves on high-school students in the past...
-   In _Cat's Eye (1988)_ by Margaret Atwood, the main character Elaine has an affair with her art teacher, Josef.
-   _Chocoholic Mysteries_: _Snowman Murders_ has its first victim, Fletcher Mendenhall, be a former college teacher who made a habit of seducing his female students. He's later murdered by someone out to protect the reputation of one of his former victims.
-   This trope is all over _Claudine At School_; it's a wonder the oversexed staff get any work done. Claudine originally falls for teaching assistant Aimee, who gets snatched by the scary new Headmistress Mademoiselle Sergent. Sergent tells Claudine she was attracted to her to begin with. The singing master Monsieur Rabastens fancies Claudine; she plays up to him when there's nothing better to do ... No wonder the school's described as a 'filthy den of tittle-tattle'.
-   In Jonathan Franzen's _The Corrections_, Chip is an English professor who has an affair with his student Melissa. It does not end well, and he gets fired and his life gets spectacularly ruined.
-   Lois McMaster Bujold's _The Curse of Chalion_ has a romance between the 35-year-old protagonist and his 19-year-old student.
-   J.M. Coetzee's _Disgrace_, with the affair ending rather badly.

-   _How to Build a Dungeon: Book of the Demon King_: Aur's apprentice Spina is one of the women who regularly have sex with him. He actually tried to avoid this, arguing that her virginity was a source of magical power, but she worked so hard to seduce him that he gave up. Aur himself eventually ended up on the student side of this trope years prior when his former master still lived.
-   _The Ice Cream Girls_ by Dorothy Koomson is based around two women trying to resolve how their ex-lover died: a man who was having affairs with both of them when they were fifteen and one of them was his student. His "relationship" with the girl is presented as abuse and "grooming" her for statutory rape but since she believed she was in love with him, the trope applies.
-   In Tamora Pierce's _The Immortals_ quartet, part of the series of books set in the medieval-esque country of Tortall, 16-year-old Daine hooks up with her 30-year-old teacher Numair. Admittedly, Numair had a TON of hang-ups about their age difference, and by that point, Daine reads more like 20 than 16. Strangely, and Pierce even points this out when questioned about this relationship, it is actually in fact very age-appropriate for the time setting. Girls were often considered of marrying age once their periods started, as it was a sign they could give birth, and often _would_ marry even younger - and with larger age gaps - than what Daine and Numair ended with.
-   In _Love Lessons_ by Jacqueline Wilson, the main character attends High School after being homeschooled all her life where she falls in love with her art teacher and begins to babysit for him. Creepily enough, the teacher reciprocates. To make it slightly less creepy, he was very disapproving of how she was behaving and was quite torn-up and confused about the fact that he loved her as well - he'd just had a child with his wife and he didn't want to ruin his marriage. When the two of them are discovered, they both lie about what happened so that he wouldn't lose his job (they claim that the crush was one-sided and that he was trying to let her down gently) and it's implied that they break up.
-   In _The Magicians_, a rather tragic case of this once occurred at Brakebills: a student by the name of Emily Greenstreet began flirting with Professor Mayakovsky, who reciprocated and apparently began a full-blown affair. Eventually he came to his senses and broke it off; Emily tried to enchant her face to make herself irresistible to him, only to accidentally disfigure herself in the process. Charlie, a fellow student who'd been carrying a torch for her, tried to help, but his clumsy efforts to repair the damage resulted in Magic Misfire that turned him into a Niffin. End result: Charlie effectively dead, Emily healed and sent home, and Mayakovksy permanently reassigned to Brakebills South - where his only contact with students would be the annual round of fourth-years in for a Training from Hell.
-   Heavily implied in Isabelle Holland's _The Man Without a Face_. 14-year-old Chuck persuades 47-year-old Justin McLeod to tutor him over the summer so he can pass the entrance exam to boarding school. Needing a father figure, Chuck becomes attracted to Justin, and Justin probably reciprocates, but Justin tries to keep things within strict bounds. It's hinted that when Justin was a teacher at the same boys' boarding school Chuck wants to go to, he may have had some sort of a relationship with a boy Chuck's age, who was killed in a car crash when Justin was drunk driving. Justin ended up in prison over this and feels deeply guilty about it — both things for reasons not entirely spelt out.
-   Matilda initially seems to want this in _The Monk_, claiming to have dressed as a man and entered the monastery to be close to Ambrosio, and even later when she starts seeking his love in return. He gives in to his growing attraction and starts a relationship with her. She seems to get bored of him about as fast as he gets bored with her, though.
-   _Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation_:
    -   Rudeus and Roxy first meet when Roxy is hired to tutor a three-year-old Rudy in magic, but don't meet again until Rudeus is a young adult. The latter meeting was a Rescue Romance, although Roxy doesn't recognize him as her former student until he tells her his name. Shortly after that, they get married. Roxy then decides to take a teaching job at Ranoa Magic Academy while Rudeus is still a student there.
    -   At seven years old, Rudeus gets a job at the house of his noble distant relatives and becomes an academic tutor to Eris, the daughter of the family. They have a rough start because Eris didn't want a teacher younger than her, but she warms up to him after he saves her from a kidnapping attempt and both fall in love over the course of six years they spend together. Like Roxy, Eris becomes one of Rudeus' wives when he's an adult.
-   A similar mentor/apprentice relationship (this time with spies/thieves) develops between the main characters during the first two books of the _Nightrunner_ series. To his credit, Seregil, the mentor, tries very hard to keep his growing feelings for the still teenage Alec a secret from everyone, especially Alec, precisely because it would be unethical to pursue a relationship with a youth who is used to obeying him, and whom he officially adopted as his ward. (Though their friends - even friends with kids the same age as Alec - try to encourage the relationship, because they live in a medieval-ish fantasy culture where marrying at 15 or 16 is considered normal, and Alec is old enough to have no problem getting into a brothel.) In the end, Seregil finally does give in, after having been thoroughly put through the wringer emotionally, and with Alec clearly and insistently coming on to him. The situation is further complicated by the facts that Alec's exact age / stage of physical development is uncertain<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ; the fact that Seregil was forced to psychologically grow up _much_ more quickly than normal for his species and despite his apparent maturity and 20-something looks wouldn't yet be considered "of age" to marry in his country of birth; and the backstory that Seregil himself had been seduced by a young man when he was less grown-up than Alec is at this point - a relationship which Seregil has come to regret deeply, if not exactly for the child molestation aspect.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   The book (and film) _Notes on a Scandal_ involves a teacher having an affair with a 15-year-old pupil. Since the age of consent is 16 in the UK, she gets arrested and sent to prison for ten months. And even if he were sixteen, it's still illegal. Adults in a position of trust, such as teachers, aren't allowed to have relationships with any of their students while they're still in school/sixth form. However, at university level, it becomes _slightly_ more acceptable in that you won't get arrested.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Aria and Ezra in the _Pretty Little Liars_ books, as well as Aria's dad and his student Meredith.
-   In _The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie_, the title character actually grooms one of "her" students (Rose) for an affair with the school's art teacher (Mr Lloyd). It is ultimately another student (Sandy) who takes this teacher for her lover.
-   The Chinese wuxia novel _The Return of the Condor Heroes_ has Yang Guo, a young rogue martial arts student, falling in love with his master, Xiao Long Nu. The issue, however, was less of age than it was of position; in those times, it was traditional for students to revere and respect their masters in the same way one would a parent. Society's inability to accept their relationship plays a very important part of their romance.
-   _The Scum Villain's Self-Saving System: Ren Zha Fanpai Zijiu Xitong_: Shen Yuan reincarnates as Shen Qingqiu, the Sadist Teacher of Luo Binghe. The story focuses on the two's eventual romance.
-   _Song at Dawn_: Dragonetz spends lots of time alone regulating his student's breathing and practicing love songs....Yet he's initially against the relationship. After a spontaneous kiss, she invites him to her bedroom and he finds himself there.
-   The _Star Wars Expanded Universe_ is full of them, albeit all between adults. First we've got the Traya/Exile subtext. Then we've got Bane/Zannah. Moving away from The Dark Side, Luke is a master to both Jem and Mara, the latter of whom he eventually married.
-   Percy Parker and Professor Alexei Rychman in _The Strangely Beautiful Series_ were star-crossed lovers in another lifetime. Naturally this leads to a romance during the events of the books.
-   _The Testament of Sister New Devil_: Chisato is the School Nurse and Basara's biological aunt. The attraction was one-sided on her end until she learned of his master/servant contracts<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  with other the girls living with him. So Chisato blackmails him into forming a contract with her as well. By volume 6, the extortion is downplayed since Basara grows mutually attracted to his aunt and consents. In the anime adaptation, their relationship only goes as far as steamy makeout sessions and foreplay. In the light novels, he finally takes Chisato's virginity towards the end of volume 7 and regularly has sex with her, from then on.
-   _Third Time Lucky: And Other Stories of the Most Powerful Wizard in the World_: In "The Last Lesson" Magdelene starts to find her master Adar attractive, and loses her virginity with him. Adar is equally into it, but somewhat taken aback by her eagerness. They don't have anything beyond this however.
-   Rose and Dimitri in _Vampire Academy_. He takes the high road and insists they can't pursue the attraction, but that obviously doesn't work. He thinks her mom finding out is scarier than facing strigoi.
-   _The Villainous Daughter's Butler, I'll Crush the Destruction Flags_: An In-Universe example - the Tristan route in the game Cecil reincarnated into could see the protagonist Alicia romancing Tristan, the man teaching the servant's course.
-   In _Warrior Cats_, when Fernpaw's mentor was exiled and she needed a new mentor, Dustpelt, who had feelings for her (and was already mentoring her twin, Ashpaw), asked if he could be her new mentor. She was thrilled at the idea, but Dustpelt's request was denied because he wouldn't be tough enough on her, hindering her training. This doesn't stop them from becoming mates, however.
-   In _Youth in Sexual Ecstasy_, this happened to the protagonist's mother, who tells him about her past in which she lost her virginity at 15 to one of her teachers, later she found out that he was married and abandoned her, it was her life's secret.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the _30 Rock_ episode "Queen of Jordan", Susan Sarandon plays Frank's former teacher, who was in a relationship with him when he was 14. Surprisingly(considering the Double Standard), based on Frank's apparent age and the fact that the teacher was only recently released from prison, it appears that she served a significantly longer sentence than is typically associated with female-teacher/male-student cases.
-   _The Affair_: Juliette, the French literature professor in season 3, has a roughly 20 year-older husband who was her former professor but is now apparently senile. She has sex with her own male college students as well. One of her female protegés also muses about sleeping with Noah, who teaches an American literature class.

Even more so when the police discover an unknown semen sample in her body. In the 10th episode of Season 2, Norman has a flashback that confirms he did indeed slept with and then murdered her.
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_: Zack Adama and his flight instructor Lt. Kara "Starbuck" Thrace were deeply in love with each other, to the point of being engaged.

-   _Degrassi_ faux-spinoff _The Best Years_ has a subplot about Noah, a geeky college freshman, getting involved with the teacher of his film-studies class, and about her husband, who turns out to be the teacher of his business class, eventually finding out.
-   The fifth series of _Big Love_ has a Story Arc where Nikki's daughter Cara Lynn and her math tutor Greg fall for each other. It does not end well- the couple are forced apart by Nikki, who implies to Cara Lynn that she wasn't the first student he'd been with (though it's ambiguous as to whether Nikki's telling the truth or lying to suit her own purposes) and then attempts to send her off to boarding school to avoid any further incidents.
-   _The Bisexual_: In the very first episode Gabe has sex with one of his students. Neither of them wants anything long term however.
-   _Blake's 7_. In "Animals", Dayna is eager to see a scientist whom she had a relationship with when he was her private tutor six years ago. Unfortunately, the script was originally written with Cally in mind, leading to Unfortunate Implications when recast with the much younger Dayna.
-   Played for laughs (male student/female teacher) in an episode of _Blossom_. When Blossom is standing for student president, her campaign team discovers her opponent had a relationship with one of his teachers. The ridiculously seductive teacher (with her face pixellated) is interviewed and claims she hadn't realized he was a student. The interviewer points out she gave him an A, to which she replies "He earned it". Blossom's campaign team, meanwhile, work very hard at presenting it as entirely the student's fault.
-   _Bones_:
    -   Brennan had a relationship with her teacher in college. He defended it by saying she was a very advanced student. Zack seemed rather interested in the idea, commenting "I'm an advanced student" rather indignantly.
    -   Brennan while wondering about why the victim was into younger men casually asked her intern whether he would date a woman much older than him. The intern reacted with shock and thought she was flirting with him.
    -   "The Twisted Bones In The Melted Truck" features the romance between a teacher and her student as the central plot when her husband turns out to be the Victim of the Week, with the student as the suspect who went on a Murder the Hypotenuse. But it turns out it was actually the culprit is student's ex who tried to seduce the teacher's husband in a bizarre attempt at payback, and killed him when he refused her.
-   In the _Broad City_ episode "House-Sitting," Abbi goes on a date with her former English teacher, who she had a crush on in high school.

-   Season 2 of _The Bridge (2011)_ features a lesbian relationship between schoolgirl Laura and teacher Beate. It costs Beate her job, and she ends up poisoned by a toxin intended for Laura.
-   Used many times in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_.
    -   Wesley and Cordelia had a mutual attraction throughout the latter half of season three; in fact, he actually thought _she_ was a teacher when they first met, in a possible nod to the Dawson Casting. Only a partial example, since Wesley was a mentor to Buffy, not her (and not a very good one), though he was presumably employed by the school in some capacity to justify him hanging out in the library.
    -   In the first-season episode "Teacher's Pet", a new hot-babe teacher seduces boys (including Xander) and invites them to her home. Of course, she turns out to be a giant man-eating mantis who preys on virgins. Hooray for metaphors.
    -   A tragic example in season two's "I Only Have Eyes for You"—back in the '50s, one of the school's female teachers had an affair with a male student. She realized it was wrong and tried to break it off, only for the distraught student to kill her, followed by himself. The plot involves their ghosts, who keep possessing random couples and almost making them act out the murder-suicide.
    -   At first Buffy's relationship with Riley _should_ fit, or at least border on, this trope — in real life, some universities consider it _very_ dodgy for a freshman to date _any_ graduate student, let alone the TA of a class you're in.
-   _Bull_: In "Teacher's Pet", the plot is focused on the relationship between teenage Jordan and his former English teacher Susan, which causes a lawsuit from his parents against her.
-   In _Charite_, nurse Ida and Doctor Behring. Noticing her interest in medicine, Behring lets her listen in on the auditorium in secret (women aren't allowed to study medicine in late 19th century Germany), gifts her with an anatomy book, teaches her medical and surgical procedures, writes her a recommendation letter for the University in Zurich — and kisses her whenever he's in a good mood over his successes. Ida knows what a troubled character he is, but she's also fascinated by him and admires him, and there's the fact that he's the only one who supports her plans and believes in her abilities. Downplayed, because Ida is an adult and Behring has no official authority over her.
-   _Class of '07_: Played for Drama as Mr. Garrity, who'd been a teacher at the school, got into "relationships" with several girls he taught, Saskia included. He would quickly drop them after graduation. It messed Saskia up deeply, with this portrayed explicitly as abusive.
-   _Community_:
    -   The show has a rare example where the student, Jeff, is actually older than the teacher, Prof. Slater. She initially refuses to date him while he's taking her class, but they get together in the next semester. Then they break up, there's a rather bizarre love triangle with another student, and Slater disappears after confessing her love for Jeff at a crowded dance in an attempt to one-up Britta.
    -   In "Social Psychology", Professor Duncan assumes Annie is hitting on him before she even asks him anything, and "lets her down" by giving her a Backhanded Compliment with "I'm not allowed to date students, even though you're an 8, which is a British 10."
    -   A halfway one Played for Laughs when Jeff becomes a teacher in season 5. He's initially an Apathetic Teacher who refuses to actually teach anything, so Annie starts taking his class in an attempt to make him take the job seriously. He doesn't, so she ends up teaching the class and treating him like a recalcitrant student. It doesn't get any farther than basic Ship Tease before he starts to take the job seriously and she drops the class.
-   In _Crazy Ex-Girlfriend_, Valencia casually admits to having done "hand stuff" with her teacher when she was a teenager, and apparently thinks that hand stuff doesn't "count" and is thus no big deal. Rebecca, however, thinks it _is_ a big deal, and is understandably disturbed by the fact that Valencia's teacher was willing to have sexual relations with a teenage girl, and repeatedly asks if that teacher ever got fired.
-   Darker than normal example in the _Criminal Minds_ episode _I Love You Tommy Brown_, a woman and Manipulative Bitch\- who turns out to be an ex-con, jailed for her relationship with one of her underage students, the titular Tommy Brown- goes on a killing spree hunting for the baby, a son named Johnny, that resulted from that relationship, executing the various foster parents who cared for the child on trial bases (forcing one to strip to humiliate them, then shooting them repeatedly because they were praying, then after finding her infant boy (shooting and leaving the woman who had him for dead) goes to the home of the student and convinces him to run away with her- he chooses to stay even after he hears her shoot his teenage classmate/neighbor (who had a crush on him), but turns on her when the team informs him that she had already had another teacher-student romance before him and had actually been writing to _him_ while she was in jail. The name of this first student? Johnny. She named the child she had with the second student after the first. Notable in that this episode takes care to avert _both_ Double Standard: Rape, Female on Female and Double Standard Rape: Female on Male.
-   _CSI: NY_: One of the cases in "City of the Dolls" revolves around a high school teacher who's having a secret affair with one of her students. They both bemoan the fact that they can't legally be together; the teacher asking, "Does it matter at all that I love him?"
-   In _Cutey Honey The Live_, we have Psycho Lesbian Mayumi Karasugawa, who often seduces her female students.
-   _Dark Desire_: Alma had sex once with Darío before realizing he was her student, but then afterward she moves the relationship into a full-blown affair despite knowing the dangers.
-   _Dawson's Creek_ had Pacey and his English teacher have an affair. Most of the adults involved took it seriously, while Pacey's friends, though somewhat disbelieving, didn't see anything wrong with it. Considering that they were teenagers and their friend seemed happy, that's fairly realistic no matter what the genders involved.
-   _Dead Like Me_ had George's father dating a student of his, but it's not _as_ bad as other examples, as this is a relationship in college, not high school (or elementary school). Note that this relationship did break up a marriage, and didn't last very long anyway. Serves them right.
-   _Dear White People_: Troy and Professor Nieka Hobbs.
-   _Degrassi: The Next Generation_:
    -   In the fourth season of Paige has an affair with the hunky student-teacher Matt. Their relationship is portrayed as a completely normal and decent thing to do, except that school rules unfairly ban it. As Paige points out to him, he's only three years older than her. A girl who hates Paige discovers her secret and taunts her, but when the relationship is exposed, _no kid in the entire school cares_, even though Paige has plenty of enemies. Matt gets fired, and the two of them think this is a good thing since now they can be together in public. Then he suddenly moves away, in a scene that ends with Paige's classic line: "You're dumping me and giving me drugs?!"
    -   Darcy is struggling after being a victim of an attack, she tells Snake (Mr. Simpson) her secret. He's the only person she wants to let in and becomes desperately attached to him. And flirty. "I think I can do better."
    -   Season 11 has the relationship between Sav and his teacher Winnie. The pair gets questioned by Principal Simpson about an alleged relationship between the two, as he had heard rumors. Sav tells him that he started the rumor to look cooler to students who picked on him. When Winnie breaks it off, she says if they dated in a different time, it could've worked.
    -   Season 13 has Tristan hooking up with his English teacher Mr. Yates, though Maya ends the relationship by telling principal Simpson about it.
-   _The Doctor Blake Mysteries_: An affair between a student and a teacher provides a possible motive for murder in "First Dance". It is ultimately a Red Herring, but it seems likely the teacher will lose her job.
-   In British soap _Emmerdale_, 40-year-old Maya Stepney groomed her 15-year-old student Jacob Gallagher into having a sexual relationship with her.
-   _ER_: Dr. Doug Ross and medical student Harper Tracy sleep together after a rough day. Doug's supervisor (and best friend) Mark is furious when he finds out—this is a major rules violation—despite both of them insisting that the encounter was completely mutual and their was no force or coercion on Doug's part.
    -   Several seasons later, Noah Wyle was opposed to plans for this between his character John Carter and his medical student Lucy Knight, feeling that such unethical behavior was uncharacteristic of Carter.
    -   Technically happened between Benton and Corday, as she was his intern at one point. And between Carter himself and an attending he was interning for.
-   _The Fast Show_ featured the character of Janine, a Dumb Blonde teenage single mother. In one sketch she refused to disclose who the father of her baby was, because "it's not fair to grass on your headmaster."
-   _Friends_
    -   Ross and his paleontology student's, Elizabeth Stevens, relationship, during season 6. They only started dating after she was no longer in his class. He eventually breaks up with her because of the maturity gap, as well as the fact that he could lose his job over it (as their school has rules against teachers dating students, they decide to hide their relationship from the former). Also a case of Dating What Daddy Hates, as her father Paul does not like Ross and threatens to call the school to tell on them, so they have to hide it from him too.
    -   Rachel once described a teacher she had a crush on and whom she eventually slept with.
    -   Phoebe's brother Frank dates his teacher Alice, who is several decades older than him, almost immediately after finishing high school; when he introduces her to Phoebe, he accidentally refers to her as "Mrs. Knight". However, unlike in most examples, this results in a happy marriage and three children, to whom Phoebe is the surrogate mother because Alice cannot conceive.
    -   Ross also made out with the fifty-year-old librarian when he was in high school.
-   On _Gilmore Girls_, Paris dates Professor Fleming (who is old enough to be her _grandfather_) when she is a freshman at Yale. He has a reputation for dating first-year students and changing them quite regularly, but his relationship with Paris lasts for about a year. And it doesn't end due to a breakup — he takes her to England with him over the summer and dies on the trip, and Paris has to exasperatedly inform Rory that, no, Fleming did _not_ go Out with a Bang. ("No, Rory, the downfall of this great man was not my vagina!") After he dies, we meet Fleming's daughter — who's _older_ than Paris! Rory is understandably grossed out by all of this, partially because she's friends with Paris, and Fleming is friends with Rory's grandfather. _Awkward_.
-   Puck and Shelby of _Glee_. Because Shelby is kind of reluctant and thinks it's a really bad idea (which it is!), and because Puck's motives are kind of unclear. Shelby is the adoptive mother of his daughter, Beth, and he's expressed multiple times how much he cares about Beth and that he wants to be in her life. So, does he want to be with Shelby because of Shelby herself, or because he wants to be a family with her and Beth?
-   _Gossip Girl_:
    -   Dan has an affair with his young teacher, Miss Carr when he was in his senior year at high school. For about 2 episodes.
    -   Season 4, Serena and Colin.
    -   Season 4, Serena and Ben. Who already had something quasi-romantic going on when she was sixteen.
-   _Grange Hill_.
    -   There was one back in about 1998/99 or so, where two lower-sixth form students went clubbing, and one of them, Evelyn, gets flirting with a university student, whose number she gets and they go on a couple of dates. Then he turns up as a new trainee teacher for her A-Level classes....things get awkward, they agree to break off the relationship right away, but news about how they first met spreads around school anyway and he is forced to resign (not just from the position, but from his teacher training course and the teaching profession as a whole). Eventually, Evelyn discovers that while they were dating (they had slept together on one, maybe two occasions during that period) she had gotten pregnant by him; they move away and set up home together, and it's implied they got married at some point too.
    -   The other occurrence of this trope was from the 1987 series, where 5th-year girl Faye falls for her teacher and manages to seduce him into a brief romance. This one doesn't get very heavy, though they are seen together on a couple of occasions outside of school, he eventually realizes it can't end well and so, well, ends it. Faye was so distracted that she fails half her O-levels and has to resit them the following year, delaying starting her A-Levels by a year, just to catch up, and almost gets distracted again when she spots her ex-bf (now ex-teacher too, having resigned), out on a date with a woman closer to his age.
-   Steven and Selina on _Home and Away_, and later Lucas and Naomi. In the latter case, the two had met and hooked up before she knew she'd be teaching in Summer Bay.
-   While it's more implied than anything, there is Patricia and Jason Winkler on _House of Anubis_. There have been strong hints that they did have some feelings for each other when he was the only one to support her when she thought Joy had been kidnapped, and Patricia seemed very happy whenever he was around and seemed more disappointed than angry when he betrayed her. Even after Jason's Face–Heel Turn, he still seemed to care about her. He hasn't been on the show since season 1 but this pairing is still wildly popular.
-   _How I Met Your Mother_:
    -   Ted briefly dates a woman who is a graduate student at the college where he is teaching architecture. College rules actually prohibit professor-student relationships. Ted finds this ridiculous in their case since he is only a few years older than her and she is an economics student and never will interact with him academically. The relationship does not last long enough for this to matter.
    -   We found out that the Mother was also in that economics class, though Ted would not date her until much later.
-   _Inspector George Gently_: In "Gently Upside Down", Gently investigates the murder of a 17-year-old schoolgirl and discovers that she was having an affair with one of her teachers (who happens to be the father of one of her best friends). It turns out the teacher has a history of this.
-   _Inspector Lynley_ had two off-screen, past examples. In _Well-Schooled In Murder_, Lynley has to question his friend, school teacher John Corntell about erotic photos of a young, male, ex-lover. They met while he was John's student, but 'once it was clear the attraction was mutual' made a joint decision not to do anything about it until the student was in university. In _If Wishes were Horses_, Lynley's wife Helen reveals she had a brief affair with the Victim of the Week while she was a university student, and he was her instructor When the murderer finds this out, she runs Helen off the road; Helen nearly dies, she miscarries her and Lynley's late term baby, and when Helen is released from hospital she leaves Lynley. The murderer did this partly as an attempted Red Herring, to make the police think the killer was targeting the victim's love interests, partly because Helen is a trained police psychologist, and was the person most likely to have worked out the killer was in fact in love with the victim's wife and trying to Murder the Hypotenuse
-   _Killing Eve_: In her backstory, Villanelle fell in love with her teacher Anna, back when she went by her real name, Oksana. This led to an illicit affair. Anna was a couple decades older than Oksana, as well as married, and the affair ended _horrifyingly_, with Oksana castrating and murdering Anna's husband.
-   Implied in _The L Word_ that Tim had a relationship with one of the girls from the swim team he coaches after he and Jenny break up. Somewhat less shocking, since it's a college team and Tim is at most in his mid-20s
-   _Law & Order: Criminal Intent_ did a fairly obvious by-the-numbers Ripped from the Headlines episode based on the Letourneau case, even casting an actress (Anne Dudek) who kinda looks like her.

-   _Little Britain_ had Edward and Samantha Grant, a teacher and his former student who were now married, although it's never revealed whether they had begun their relationship while Samantha was still at school.
-   This featured in _Neighbours_ with Rachael meeting and getting the number of a cute 20-something who turns out to be her new teacher. Initially he gets mad (he thought she was in University) and tries not to encourage her, but she persists and they date in secret for a bit, then the writers obviously got bored and had him get busted, allowing for a long court case, shortish prison stay, then another attempt at a relationship (he isn't teaching anymore of course), until the overwhelmingly negative attitudes of everyone around them prompt him to move away.
-   _New Tricks_: An affair between a teacher and a student plays a role in "The Queen's Speech". The student was looking for the teacher when she got killed. The teacher never told anyone about the affair to avoid trouble, and this may have hampered the original investigation.
-   Fiona Brake and Dennis Doyle in _Night and Day_. Troublingly, there appear to be no consequences whatsoever for Fiona's career, despite the fact that by the end of the series it's the show's worst-kept secret.
-   Michael and Nikita on _Nikita_ pre-Series, although flashbacks occur. Michael was Nikita's instructor during her time at Division. They fall in love with each other although their relationship doesn't progress until the start of the current series 3 years after Nikita escaped from Division and Michael is the one hunting her.
-   There was an episode of _Nip/Tuck_ about this, though the teacher and student were married. The student wanted to get surgery so he would look older so people would stop looking at them. He got some hair plugs. Then he walked in on his wife having sex with his younger brother, presumably because he still looked like a teenager.
-   _NUMB3RS_:
    -   One arc involves a high school teacher sleeping with a 17-year-old student. When the student's dad finds out, they kill him and then set off on a crime spree.
    -   Charlie and Amita had sparks flying from the first episode, but Charlie specifically mentions (in response to his father's prodding) that the school's rules prohibit them from dating while he's her thesis advisor, so they only get together after she finishes her PhD. There is also less of an age gap than most since Charlie was a Child Prodigy in mathematics and got his own PhD much earlier than the normal trajectory.
-   In Season Four of _One Tree Hill_, Brooke Davis enters into a relationship with Nick Chavez, whom she met online, who later turns up as her new English teacher at Tree Hill High. They continue dating, in secret until it is revealed that he has cheated on her.
-   _The Orville_: In "Shadow Realms" we learn Claire and Admiral Christie began a relationship while she was still a student at Union Point. She says they tried to spin a tale of a whirlwind romance that occurred after she graduated but that they probably didn't fool anybody.
-   In _Queer as Folk (UK)_, Stuart narrates to the camera how he lost his virginity to his (male) PE teacher. When he was _eleven_.
-   _Regenesis_: After showing a strangely familiar relationship between Mayko and her boss David for the first couple of seasons (she's frequently criticizing and disobeying him, more so even than his other friends/colleagues; and she stays at his bedside when he's in a coma), it's finally revealed that they used to be lovers in the past - while he was a professor and she was his student. They even had a baby, though Mayko gave the kid up for adoption without ever telling David she was pregnant. And apparently, Mayko was not the only student with whom David had an affair. It's treated as not much of an ethical problem by the show, probably because someone of David's scientific skill level would most likely have taught graduate or PhD students.
-   In _Renegadepress.com_'s "The Power Of Love", when popular teacher, 32-year-old Mrs. Tropek begins a relationship with her 17-year-old student, Keith, it doesn't take long for gossip to spread like wildfire.
-   Played for laughs on _Reno 911!_ when a teacher, played by Carmen Electra is casually handcuffed by Junior and Wiegel with the student being a stereotypical nerd. To clear the confusion, of doing _him,_ as in a nerd and not a cuter boy, the teacher explains he's a KidAnova with matching stamina, proving this when Wiegel is caught making out with him, claiming he came onto her when it was the other way around and for good measure, Junior took a cell phone pic and sent it to Dangle.
-   _Riverdale_: Archie has a sexual relationship with Miss Grundy at the start of the series. He believes there's a deeper emotional connection there, but Jughead believes she's using him, and there are hints to the audience that he's right. Notably, the show does _not_ gloss it over or treat it as okay.
-   In the _Rumpole of the Bailey_ episode "Rumpole and the Course of True Love", the case Rumpole is defending is a young high school teacher who slept with his student. Privately none of the lawyers seem to care very much, least of all the prosecuting attorney. She reasons that the girl was almost 16 anyway and "probably asked for it."
-   This trope was a major plot point in _Saved by the Bell: The College Years_, in which Kelly dated her professor. She even dropped his class in order to avoid the awkwardness. Zack was not amused and gave Lasky a hell of a chewing-out at one point.
-   On _Seinfeld_ Jerry is dating a woman whose boss turns out to be his old rival in high school Duncan Meyer. Duncan hates Jerry because he was a legend as the "fastest kid in school" after winning a track race in the ninth grade. Jerry won due to a head start that nobody but George saw. Only Duncan suspected he cheated. Jerry gets George to pretend he hasn't seen him since high school to convince his girlfriend and Duncan that he saw Jerry win the race fairly. When George "runs in" to them at the diner he says he remembers that race well since he claims it was the same day he lost his virginity to Miss Stafford the "voluptuous" homeroom teacher: "I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard..." Jerry then stops him and gets him back to talking about the race.
-   In Season 5 of _Shameless (US)_, Lip begins having an affair with a professor of his, and it's stated he's not the first student she's had relations with in the past. It doesn't end well at all for either of them when it's discovered by the school board.
-   Chris successfully seduces his Psychology teacher Angie in _Skins_.
-   _Smallville_ has Lana and Jason in Season 4. Made somewhat less squicky by the fact that the two had already been dating for a while when he gets the job and the fact that he was a football coach and had little to no involvement in the context of school.
-   Happened in _Soap_ with Billy and his teacher. She just happens to leave her job at the school right as he turns eighteen, but the relationship _still_ doesn't last. Oh, and _he_'s the one who breaks it off (which causes her to become a Yandere).
-   In an early episode of _The Sopranos_, a girl on Meadow's soccer team attempts suicide by slitting her wrists. Turns out she was having an affair with the coach, who was leaving to coach on a college team.
-   _Strangers with Candy_ has an episode in which Tammi Littlenut, normally the Only Sane Woman, is revealed to be in a relationship with her biology teacher. (During one class, he spells out "I <3 U" on her desk with an eye, a heart, and a bit of intestine.)
-   On _Swingtown,_ Laurie Miller is ferociously pursuing her hot teacher Mr. Stephens. He discourages her affection and when they do get together, they avert the trope since he's not her teacher anymore.
-   In an early episode of _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_, a girl at the high school that Cameron and John are attending under assumed identities is exposed as having carried on a relationship with one of her teachers, and kills herself when this is made public.
-   _That '70s Show_:
    -   The series has an episode in which Fez wants his English teacher to be his prom date. Early on at the prom, he asks her to dance and she declines. At the end of the episode, they are seen dancing. He asks Eric for the key to the hotel room that he & Donna didn't use. The teacher says she is not going to a motel with him, and he replies, "Yes, and you also said you would not dance with me." This teacher also happened to be Grey DeLisle.
    -   Among many other men, town slut Laurie (Eric's sister), dates her college professor for a while, and even brings him over for dinner. It doesn't end well - and even causes a (very short) Parental Favoritism switch.
    -   In one episode the kids' math teacher hooks up with Brainless Beauty Kelso, which everyone finds out about when he shows up with her as his date to Thanksgiving dinner. Reactions range from vaguely creeped out to outright disgusted. She defends herself by saying, "Hey, he's eighteen, I barely make minimum wage. I deserve a little something nice." These examples all show a sort of in-universe Values Dissonance since in the seventies this matter was seen as uncommon but not raising to the level of horror as it does now.
-   The BBC miniseries _True Love_ has a lesbian variant, with the young teacher and her student mutually falling for each other after sharing a mutual appreciation for art.
-   _Vera_: A seemingly reciprocal (although short-lived) teacher/student features in "Muddy Waters". Years later, the student discovered that the teacher's child was actually his son and tried to connect with the boy. Although Vera and her team investigate this angle, it ultimately turned out to have nothing to do with his murder.
-   On _The Walking Dead_, Shane brags to Rick about sleeping with their 30-year-old female PE teacher when he was in high school.
-   In _Waterloo Road_, there was Jonah and his Spanish Teacher, who were in a secret relationship for months. She ended up pregnant with his child. In the end of the series, they got found out but managed to run away to get married before the police caught them.
-   On _The X-Files_, we find that Scully has done this _twice_—once with a professor in medical school and an instructor in the FBI Academy. The professor in medical school had a strong impact on the plot; in "all things" it's revealed that Scully was unaware that Daniel (her professor) was still married. Scully, shocked and ashamed, broke off the relationship and joined the FBI. Over 10 years later (during "all things"), they meet again. Daniel is under the impression that Scully is still in love with him, and invites her to run away with him. It ends with Scully realizing that doesn't regret the way her life turned out and marks the episode in which she and Mulder begin a sexual relationship.
-   _Your Honor_: Adam is in a relationship with his teacher Frannie when the first season starts.

    Music 

-   Busted's song "What I Go to School For" was based on a crush their bassist had on a teacher in real life. The final verse reveals that Miss Mackenzie, the teacher being crushed on, feels the same way and the song ends with them running away together. The Disneyfied cover by The Jonas Brothers rewrote the lyrics to make it about a Freshman crushing on a Senior.
-   The song "Sossity (You're A Woman)" by Jethro Tull, about just how psychologically disturbing such an affair could be. The exact age of the boy is unclear but is implicitly about 12.
-   "Just Sixteen" by Velvet Revolver.
-   Lionel Richie's video for "Hello" has a college professor follow his blind student from class to class (somehow being ignored in almost all of them) because he's in love with her. At the end, the student reveals that her own love for him has given her the ability to "see" him well enough to sculpt his face. Even with the strong stalker vibes, the last scene of him holding her hands is kind of sweet.
-   "Don't Let Me Get Me" by P!nk at one point says she had a relationship with her teacher. In the video, it shows said teacher in the front of the class looking suggestively at her.
-   This trope is the underlying plot of "Don't Stand So Close to Me" by The Police. In that song, a schoolgirl develops a crush on a young teacher, who is uncomfortable and embarrassed at how he returns the feelings, and gives her a ride home one rainy afternoon. A scandal erupts when a rumor begins to spread that they slept together, though the song never actually states that they did. There is no evidence that he took advantage of her feelings (it's never explicitly stated in the song's lyrics, but Sting offhandedly confirmed in a 1981 interview that the teacher raped her). The school board seems to assume the worst anyway. It doesn't help that the girl has been _planning_ to seduce him and is quite obvious about it. Sting also said it was inspired on personal experience:
    
    **Sting:** I'd done teaching practice at secondary schools and been through the business of having 15-year-old girls fancying me — and me really fancying them! How I kept my hands off them I don't know...
    
-   The song "Scandalous Scholastics" by Gym Class Heroes is all about a 15-year-old boy pursuing a sexual relationship with his teacher, but with a humorous tone.
-   The bizarre implications of the "Total Eclipse Of The Heart" video.
-   Venom has made a few Intercourse with You songs on the subject like "Teacher's Pet".

    Theater 

-   In _Arcadia_, a young man, Septimus, is the private tutor of a teenage girl named Thomasina and they eventually fall in love. Thomasina's death the night before her 17th birthday breaks Septimus's heart and turns him into a half-mad hermit.
-   _Butley_ by Simon Gray. Butley, a lecturer in English literature at a London university, finds out that his wife of a year is leaving him for another man. He also finds out that his long term live-in friend/boyfriend is leaving him for another man. Said friend/boyfriend, now a colleague of Butley's, used to be his student and it's implied that that's when their relationship began.
-   Leon and Sophia in _Fools_. Luckily they are the same age and eventually marry.
-   One of the main plots of _The History Boys_. The male students like one of their teachers so much, they let him harmlessly grope them so he can get a cheap thrill. Later, another teacher attempts to start up an actual relationship with one of the boys, but it never actually gets anywhere despite mutual interest. The second teacher spends much of the film extremely aware of how inappropriate it is, and is only able to give in to the student's flirtations once the year is over. The film is more ambiguous about why Dakin and Irwin never get together, but the stage version explicitly states that the relationship doesn't happen is because Irwin is injured in a motorcycle crash, rendering him paralyzed from the waist down..
-   The whole plot of _The Phantom of the Opera_, where the Phantom falls in love with his voice student Christine.
-   The first scene original stage version of _Speech And Debate_ features Howie talking to an older man on an online chat man, whom he realizes is his drama teacher, Mr. Healy, when exchanging pictures. He still went to the park to meet him, but the teacher didn't show. Solomon's whole "friendship" with Howie begins because the former is researching similar cases of older men preying on newly-legal boys for a story in the school paper, and later in the show, Diwata realizes that this is partially because Solomon gave Mr. Healy a handjob in the bathroom after school earlier that year, although this subplot was removed from the movie.
-   In Shakespeare's _The Taming of the Shrew_, Bianca falls for her tutor Lucentio, who took the job in the hope that she would.

    Video Games 

-   _The Banner Saga_: Juno is a member of the Mender Council and Eyyvind's mentor. The two love each other deeply. As it turns out, Juno was actually executed by the Mender Council because she uses her powers to brainwash people, a capital offence. Eyyvind did... _something_ to bring her back to life, and whatever it is, it means the Serpent is angry because whatever is keeping Juno alive is slowly killing it. Somewhat unconventional example.
-   In _Detention_, there's a case of Counselor/Student romance. It was with protagonist Fang Ray Shin and Mr. Chang, the school counselor who helped her deal with her horrid home life. It ended badly, but not for the normal reasons- Ray thought that teacher Ms. Yin was in a relationship with Mr. Chang (they weren't; Ms. Yin was warning him that Ray could get in trouble for associating with him since he was involved in the forbidden book club), so she ratted Ms. Yin's forbidden book club to the authorities to get her out of the way. This did not work out the way she expected- Ms. Yin was forced to flee the country, sure, but the club members were imprisoned and Mr. Chang was executed. Rey was Driven to Suicide from guilt, which leads to the main game where she's trapped in a purgatory resembling a demonic copy of her school.
-   _Fire Emblem_ includes a number of these throughout the series:
    -   In _Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade_, The Hero Roy has six different potential romance options. One of those options is Cecilia, Mage General of Etruria and Roy's instructor in combat and strategy.
    -   In _Fire Emblem: Awakening_, the Action Girl Sully can marry her Sexy Mentor Frederick and have a child with him (the Glacier Waif Kjelle). While both of them can have other love interests, their mentor relationship is quite the key point of their supports.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Female Corrin can opt for this in _Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest_ with Gunther, Corrin's retainer and combat instructor since childhood.
    -   Due to the combination of its setting with its choice to retain the dating and matchmaking sim elements of its predecessors, _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_ has a _lot_ of opportunities for one of these to come about. Garreg Mach teachers Manuela, Hanneman, and especially Byleth are fully capable of getting together with characters from the pool of students. Granted, none of these can become overtly romantic until after the five-year timeskip, at which point the "teachers" aren't actually the students' instructors anymore, but Byleth is still regularly referred to as "Professor" by their former students even then.
-   In _GrimGrimoire_, Opalnaria, the Necromancy teacher, is extremely distrustful of any student/teacher relationships because her former teacher was assassinated by her student lover. Opalnaria herself teaches Hiram, and the guy eventually declares his love for her, shocking the hell out of Opalnaria. She even tries to say how the relationship wouldn't work because she is actually about 100 years old, but by the end of the game, one of the teachers informs the main character that Opalnaria cast a spell on herself to make herself look like a schoolgirl so that she could be with Hiram.
-   _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_:
    -   The game can go there with a Female Exile and the Jedi Disciple. The Disciple was supposed to be the Exile's padawan before she left for the Mandalorian Wars. However, her leaving meant he never was chosen, and he was washed out of the Order - becoming a Republic soldier instead. Ten years later, He Is All Grown Up, and still has a cross of hero-worship and romantic feelings when it comes to the Exile...
    -   If you play a male character, there are hints that Atris was infatuated with the Exile. Especially apparent when the Handmaiden returns to her late in the game, and in a fit of jealous rage Atris will attack her with Force Lightning, spewing accusations about the Handmaiden's feelings for the Exile.
    -   The same could be said of almost every implied romance in KotOR2, as some party members can eventually become Jedi students of the Exile. And since those characters will only become Jedi if you increase their affection towards you, almost any opposite gender teacher/student pairing bears a degree of potential for romance. And that's not even mentioning the somewhat unwholesome attitude Kreia has toward you at times or the implied relationship between Kreia and Sion...
-   In _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel_, Rean can engage in bonding events with his classmates and his homeroom teacher, Sara Valestine. Sara is often jokingly flirtatious towards him, but starting in the second game Rean can actively pursue her and should he choose her for his final bonding event, she tells him that if he's still interested after he graduates, she'll be waiting for him. She'll even tease the class with alluding to the fact that she might have a boyfriend when they attempt to poke fun at her for never having one at the end of the game.
-   _The Lion's Song_: Wilma, a composer, has a crush on her (significantly older) music teacher, Arthur Caban, but player choice and the success of her composition determines whether or not she pursues him and wins his affections.
-   In a school assignment in _Mana Khemia Alchemists Of Alrevis_, The Hero asks his homeroom teacher Professor Zeppel what sort of food the school nurse, also a teacher herself, would like (making food that the latter teacher liked _is the assignment_). Zeppel, with good reason, comes to the obvious conclusion...
-   In _Mass Effect 2_, due to Shepard being a huge influence in their life, should they be romanced, this basically defines the relationship between Male Shepard and Tali, as well as that of Female Shepard and Garrus.
-   _My Time at Portia_: Defied with Dr Xu and Nurse Phyllis. If you get Phyllis's affection meter up to "Friend", one of the random things that she'll tell you when you talk to her is that she's puzzled (and slightly annoyed) that people in town assume that she and Xu have a romantic relationship. In actuallity, their relationship is purely professional and neither is interested in the other (though they're both potential romance options for the Player Character).
-   In _Persona 5_, the Temperance confidant is Sadayo Kawakami, the Protagonist's homeroom teacher. On the side, she moonlights as a call-in maid, with the protagonist becoming her main client. Though slightly suggestive, most of the activities she does are practical in nature, such as cooking and cleaning (she does this dressed as a maid, though, so it's not entirely innocent, and she makes a point of saying that due to Joker being underage she isn't going to offer _all_ of her normal services). At the end of her plotline, however, she and the protagonist can enter into a romantic relationship; though the concept of a teacher-student romance has been teased in _Persona_ before, this is the first time it's been possible to actually follow through on it. Ms. Kawakami is, however, aware of the implications and is quite reluctant to pursue the romance unless Joker confirms three times that it's what he wants, and if you're still in a relationship with her in the epilogue, she decides that she's too uncomfortable being in a relationship with a minor and tells Joker that she wants to wait until he's legally old enough.
-   The Les Yay between Candy Cane and Miss Spencer in _Rumble Roses_. Particularly blatant in Miss Spencer's Heel storyline.
-   A really weird and rather murky version of this exists in _Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne_. Yuko Takao, the teacher in question, is rather beloved by her students, and the Demifiend/Hitoshura in particular is singled out by her as being someone she trusts to be there for her when she really could use your help. Also, though you play a Heroic Mime, it's explicitly lampshaded by all the other characters who know her that the two of you have a very good rapport, and on the street prior to the actual start of the game, one fellow high school student points out that it's quite obvious the two of you are close. However, even though its made quite clear that the main protagonist does care about her quite a lot (and you do wind up rescuing her), the exact level of the relationship (deep respect for the other all the way to outright love) between the two of you is never clearly defined.
-   _The Sims 2: University_, like any Sims game, lets you have sex ("Woo Hoo") with anyone if you get your relationship with them high enough. This includes university professors, who are Sims that can be invited on dates or to one's home... and incidentally, doing so will increase a Sim's grades.
-   In _Star Wars: The Old Republic_, all<sup>*&nbsp;</sup>  the male Force-using classes have attractive female Padawans (Apprentices in the Sith Warrior's and Inquisitor's cases) who are all attracted to the Player Character. Nadia and Dark Side!Jaesa are the most obvious about it, Ashara the least, and Kira's somewhere in the middle. The Male Agent can also have this with Raina, as Intelligence assigns her to him as his protégé.
-   _Summertime Saga_:
    -   The MC can seduce every single one of his teachers by acing their classes. It's practically required to complete the game.
    -   Even outside of MC, Miss Ross, the Granola Girl art teacher, is _very_ hands on with her students and appears to fancy Mia in particular.
    -   Mrs. Smith is using her Sycophantic Servant Anna as a sex puppet.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   In _Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World_, you can make an in-game selection which puts Lloyd in a romantic relationship with any female character, including Raine.
        
        -   It's just a follow up of _Tales of Symphonia_, where you could pair up Lloyd with any teammate depending on what choices you made during the game. It affected many cutscenes and could even alter the plot if you picked up Kratos. Of course, Lloyd being what he is, most of the flirting and romantic Double Entendres were lost to him.
        
        **Raine:** \[Snowflakes\] all look like the same cold snow, but in reality, they're very sensitive to the environment around them.  
        **Lloyd:** Well yeah, I get that, but...  
        **Raine:** In other words, the temperature around me has changed.  
        **Lloyd:** Oh! I see. You're saying that there's something that has changed you.  
        **Raine:** Hehe, although it would seem that my heat source hasn't realized it at all.  
        **Lloyd:** Huh? Huh?
        
    -   Happens in a vague sense in _Tales of the Abyss_. After Luke destroys Akzeriuth, Tear teaches him to control his hyperresonance, granted, the sessions are informal and Tear isn't a full-fledged teacher; they both fall in love with each other.
-   _Twilight Syndrome_ has a romantic relationship between main character Yukari and Kazuya Kitamura, a trainee teacher at the high school she attends, as a central plot point in her personal development arc. Kitamura is adamant about keeping things between them a secret out of fear of the stigma that such a relationship brings, but ends up breaking things off between them owing to Yukari's apparent apathy towards his concerns, though he remarks that he would like to try again later when circumstances are different. In the final chapter, it comes out that Yukari's true feelings about him were much more sympathetic than she was willing to let on, being one of many such aspects about herself that she is forced to confront in the surreal mystical void she finds herself moving through in the game's finale.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Amorous Professor Cherry_ (trust me, it's Exactly What It Says on the Tin), this is both played straight with supporting character Mamiko, who willingly nails students who obviously are hot for her, and slightly subverted by ultra-naive Chieri, who isn't originally this way, but will eventually become this trope, depending on the ending. Said ending can then either play it straight/subvert/avert this even then, as the game has many branches that can entirely alter this trope.
-   _Being A DIK_ has the MC's romance with Isabella. Though it is initially a somewhat unusual example – she is B&R's librarian, not his teacher – it is played straighter when she becomes his teacher after Cathy's resignation in Season 2. Bella is visibly angsty about the prospect of a relationship with Tremolo: not only is their relationship potentially against university guidelines, and not only is she nearly twice his age, but she seems to still be married to her seemingly missing husband James, believing herself to be an adultress for her feelings towards him. It's a significant reason why hers is among the most brittle romance routes in the game, with several decisions leading her to potentially instantly reject you.
    -   The MC can also engage in a romance with Jade, his Gender Studies teacher, though it is less a "romance" and more of her using him as an outlet to vent her frustrations and anger regarding her failed marriage.
-   _C14 Dating_: Hendrik, one of the love interests, is a teaching assisstant in all but name for the summer class Melissa is taking. In Hendrik's romantic route, by the time the two of them admit to their feelings to each other, Melissa is seven weeks into the eight-week class, so they agree to keep things professional for the last week and think it over, since all the game's romantic routes become a Long-Distance Relationship in the short term.
-   In _Class Trip Crush_, the guys' teacher Mr. Shindo is also a potential love interest. Naka has a crush on him as well, although nothing much seems to come of it.
-   In the H-Game _Crescendo (JP)_, a considerable subversion occurs. Kaori Shito, the school nurse, is a possible hook-up for your protagonist (a student) but she does not actively try to seduce you. In fact, she actually tries to avoid doing anything remotely offensive on school grounds, and off them she tries very hard not to act on her feelings for you. If you get her good ending, she caves in but makes the responsible choice to quit her job as a school nurse because she did something against the ethics of her profession. It should be noted you both have feelings for each other, but your character tries his hardest not to act on his either, and her reasons for avoiding you are because she had a student fall for her once, (he was depressed and she tried to be a mother figure to him, but he fell for her instead) it ended with her turning him down because it wasn't ethical, and he killed himself because he couldn't handle the rejection, and as a result tried very hard to avoid the same situation with you. The above said, if you get her good ending, she will even quit an arranged marriage to be with you, and your fellow female classmates help sabotage the arranged marriage meeting, despite their own feelings for you, because they want you to be happy.
-   _The Curse of Kudan_: One of Sakuya's love interests is Touko Shima, a rich woman who teaches a culinary class. Sakuya admires Touko for her femininity and attends the class to be close to her.
-   _Divi-Dead_: Both Ms. Mayumi, and the nurse Aki Bonus squick, as Aki is your, or more specifically, the spirit residing in your body's, mother.
-   The protagonist of _Double Homework_ has the option of having sex multiple times with Ms. Walsh. Downplayed, as it doesn’t go anywhere much outside sex, and the protagonist cannot ultimately have a relationship with Ms. Walsh.
-   In _Gakuen Heaven_, one of the romantic options is with a teacher.
-   In the pigeon Dating Sim _Hatoful Boyfriend_, one of your romance options is your math teacher Kazuaki. He's initially reluctant to get into a relationship with you because he believes he doesn't have room in his heart to love anyone after the emotional trauma of his brother's death, but if you successfully romance him, he promises to wait at the school so that you can come to him again when you're grown up if you still love him then.
-   In the H-Game _Heart de Roommate_, the hero can start a relationship with his homeroom teacher, Yoshiko. The school ends up finding out about it and they are forced to stay away from each other until the end of the year. The weirdest part? _Yoshiko got in trouble for being in a relationship with a student before._
-   In _Highschool Romance_, Principal Lea, who's also the PE Teacher, not only is the one who set the plot in motion, but she's also one of the three romanceable characters. While in both Selena and Hoshi's endings he becomes their boyfriend, romancing Lea to the end results in her and Shoji becoming a full-blown married couple.
-   In _Magical Diary_, the PC can end up forced into marriage with Professor Grabiner. It's a purely pragmatic action taken to keep her from getting killed by putting her into the protection of his family, and as such it's only intended to last for A Year and a Day, but depending on the player's decisions by the end of the game the two of them can form a more personal connection that is more implied than outright stated to be romantic.
-   _Melody_:
    -   The protagonist and Melody are mutually attracted, even though it takes a while for either of them to admit it.
    -   Also, the protagonist and Sophia, if the protagonist decides to both teach and date her. Sophia is both more aware and more forward than either the protagonist or Melody.
-   In _Nurse Love Addiction_, one of Asuka's love interests is her teacher Kaede. Kaede is actually the one who takes their relationship further by asking Asuka to be her girlfriend.
-   In _Tokimeki Memorial 2_, the player's teacher, Asou Kasumi, is available as a love interest. Teacher/Student Romance is more common in the _Girl's Side_ games; in "1st Love," both homeroom teacher Himuro Reiichi and school principal Amanohashi Ikkaku are available, and in "2nd Kiss," there's Wakaouji Takafumi. In all cases, the teachers are more difficult to win over than classmates, in part because they're well aware that a relationship with a student is inappropriate.
-   In the Dating Sim/Visual Novel _True Love Junai Monogatari_, one of the Chivalrous Pervert male lead's possible girlfriends is his young and beautiful teacher, Yumi Matsumiya. Curiously, to unlock Yumi's path properly you need to help her save _another_ girl (Good Bad Girl Mayumi) from a Near-Rape Experience; the guy who tries to rape her is another teacher - _Yumi's ex-boyfriend_. (Sorta)

    Webcomics 

-   _Dumbing of Age_ includes a less morally-questionable example as Sal, a college student, hooks up with Jason, her Teacher Assistant, who is presumably similar in age.
    -   Jason's coworker Penny regularly seduces her male students. This bites her in the ass later when Joe's 'Do-List' is leaked, with enough of a description of Penny that her bosses figure out right away that she slept with him, and fire her. Her parting shot has her accuse Jason of doing the same thing, not knowing that he did actually sleep with Sal.
-   In _Lady Spectra & Sparky_, college freshman Paula bonds with middle-aged Prof. Carson over their mutual love of Techno Babble. She becomes his research assistant, romance blooms, and eventually they marry.
-   In _Namir Deiter_, Gabby's cousin assisted a class Tipper took in Spring '06, and she sets them up to get herself over Tipper for good, despite both this fact and her hating him passionately. They go to great lengths to keep their relationship secret, but it turns out that since he was only a TA at the time, it wasn't actually against policy, although it's mentioned that he might have gotten in trouble if it had come out before her graduation in '07. They ultimately marry in '09.
-   One of the recurring couples in _Tawawa on Monday_ is a mutual example, with their first installment set just after the girl graduated from high school.

    Web Original 

    Western Animation 

-   In an episode of _The Cleveland Show_, Lester reveals that his morbidly obese wife Kendra was once his guidance counselor, and had "guided" him into dropping out of school and moving in with her. He admits that she was a terrible guidance counselor.
-   Played With in an episode of _A Kind of Magic_ from Xilam between the protagonist, Tom, and his teacher, Miss Tinker, mostly thanks to a spell than turns Tom in a Prince Charming.
-   The Mummy, Rath from _Mummies Alive!_ had a student named Chontra and there was chemistry between the two. At one point he stopped teaching her and she became angry towards him for it, though it was really because Rath felt that there was nothing more he could teach her. Chontra never learned about this last part and was still bitter thousands of years later.
-   _South Park_: Taken to satiric extremes in "Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy", where the new teacher at school has an affair with a _kindergartner_, Kyle's baby brother Ike. This episode also satirizes the way reaction to such student-teacher affairs differ depending on the gender of the teacher, as the police and general public are outraged at the thought of a teacher having sex with a student... until they realize that it's a young, attractive woman having an affair with a male student, at which point they all congratulate Ike ("Nice...").

### Other

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _The Quintessential Quintuplets_ has a rather unusual case, with a character being on both ends of the trope at different stages of her life. Rena Nakano, the quintuplets' late mother, fell in love and married her former teacher, Mudou, but he abandoned her after he learned of her pregnancy. She became a teacher herself and eventually married again, this time to Maruo, one of her own students.
-   _School Mermaid_ plays this trope a couple different ways:
    -   The teacher Noriko (who's approaching Old Maid territory) wants her student Morita for herself, which puts her at odds with Misaki, whom Noriko thinks wants the same boy, and is willing to both activate the mermaid curse and eat the flesh of the M mermaid to force Morita to love her, and kill Misaki to ensure she doesn't get him first. She only learns too late that Misaki is going after someone else whose name starts with the letter M, but is unable to eat the flesh of the M Mermaid in time and becomes a mermaid herself.
    -   That 'M' person Misaki was trying to get? _Her English teacher Manabe_. And unlike Noriko, she _succeeds_. At the end of the story she's seen in his car as they plan to be together after he divorces his wife. Later revelations put this in a much worse light. The mermaids went feral around Misaki, which (as revealed in later chapters) only happens if the object of the hunter's affections already returns them. In other words _Manabe was already in love with Misaki_.
-   In _Tona-Gura!_, Hatsune Arisaka's former teacher Kogorou, also leading to a case of Teacher/Student Romance on Hatsune's part. Younger sister Kazuki's awkward pursuer Yuuji Kagura suspects he also holds these feelings for Kazuki, also a former student. Best evidence is, Yuuji's wrong, although Kogorou is flattered by her attention. Given the age difference between Hatsune and Kogorou, some feel this may make him a bigger pervert than Yuuji.
-   In _UQ Holder!_, Touta gets himself wrapped up in a very weird Time-Travel Romance with a younger version of his teacher/adoptive mother Yukihime. Note that none of this took place during the time that she was his teacher.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _21 Jump Street_, Ms. Griggs gets the hots for Jenko the first time he attends her class. Of course, he's actually an undercover cop in his twenties and not a real high school student, so there really isn't any issue. She does a terrible job at hiding it and Jenko is confused by her actions, however it's revealed during the end credits that they had sex while he was high as a kite and he doesn't remember it.
-   _Blame (2017)_: Abigail and Mr. Woods grow increasingly close while rehearsing _The Crucible_, getting to the point that he kisses her. He realizes that it was wrong though, backing away from anything else. Unknown to him though, Melissa also has feelings for him, with her jealousy over this resulting in her plotting against him.
-   _The Eiger Sanction_. A pretty blonde female student writes a note to her friend about their art professor (Jon Hemlock, played by Clint Eastwood) who is also a mountain climber: "He can climb all over me." When she approaches him after class seeking Sextra Credit however he brushes her off, as he "refuses to sleep with students or drunks".
    
    **Student:** If there was anything I could do to get a better grade. I mean, I'd be willing to do anything. _\[Hemlock turns to look at her\]_ Anything at all, really.
    
    **Hemlock:** Are you...busy this evening?
    
    **Student:** _\[smiles\]_ No!
    
    **Hemlock:** Do you live alone?
    
    **Student:** Well my roommate's gone for the week...
    
    **Hemlock:** Good. Then go on home, break out the books, and study your little ass off. That's the best way to maintain a "B" average.
    
    _\[The student walks off in a snit, giving the audience a Male Gaze look at her rear\]_
    
    **Hemlock:** _\[smirks\]_ Don't study it all off.
    
-   _The Invisible Maniac_ played with this a bit. Kevin Dornwinkle, who's got some... major sexual hangups due to his atrocious upbringing gets the old "I'll do anything for an A" come-on from one of his more voluptuous blonde remedial students, but basically brushes her off by advising her to study more. The school principal, a gal who evidently Really Gets Around, manages to seduce one of his rather lecherous and weak-willed male students, who's also the Designated Hero with a similar ploy, however. This rather sordid situation culminates with the Principal later attempting to seduce Kevin Dornwinkle as well, who proves to be no pushover despite the rather prurient ways he's previously shown using his invisibility formula.
    
    **Kevin Dornwinkle**: "Ever since I was in _grade school_, I've wanted to do this to a principal." \[Moves in to kiss her, sliding her blouse down off her shoulders...\]
    
    \[ ...and then stabs her to death with a letter opener. That is indeed what a _lot_ of kids in grade school would like to do to their teachers and principals.\]
    
-   The school psychologist and Micah get it on in _Easy A_. He's not the brightest bulb in the tree, though, and is well over the age of consent. Of course, his wildly conservative parents aren't too happy once he gets chlamydia...
-   _Liberal Arts_: Jesse Fischer has had a crush on his former Professor Judith Fairfield since his days as a student. They had a one night stand near the end of the film that ended on a terrible note.
-   _A Simple Favor_: Implied between Beth and Sean. He's a professor and she's his TA. Emily says they all had a threesome together, but Sean denies it.
-   This concept is _viciously_ deconstructed in the aptly named indie film (and Hulu series based off the film), _A Teacher_, where the affair between Diana, the teacher, and her teenage student, Eric, is shown to be toxic and comes off as more creepy and uncomfortable than sexy, or captivating. What starts as a hot, infatuated fling grows into obsession as Diana is shown to be extremely mentally unstable and Eric obviously has no idea how to deal with it; the looming threat of being caught and the fallout that would arise also does no favors for their relationship. The film ends with Diana crying, alone, in a motel room while listening to a voicemail that very heavily implies that Eric confessed, meaning she's not only going to be thoroughly humiliated, possibly criminally charged, and certainly fired, but she's also lost the object of her obsession. In the series, Claire (the teacher's name for the series) confesses, serves prison time and loses everything. While Claire's trying to apologize, Eric makes it clear that she scarred him for life and that he’ll never forgive her.
-   In _Teachers (1984)_, one of Alex's students has to get an abortion after she's impregnated by the gym teacher.

    Literature 

-   _Doing It_ by Melvin Burgess subverts the hell out of this trope by showing just how psychologically messed up a teacher would have to be to want to have sex with her student and why, in the long run, this sort of relationship would be damaging to the student in question.
-   The protagonist of _Election_ hates the student who had an affair with his friend and ruined his career then starts having an affair with her too, but she's already out of school by then.
-   _The Empirium Trilogy_: Subverted with Rielle and her tutor, Tal. Rielle had a crush on Tal when she was younger and had erotic fantasies about him every so often when she got older. Tal states that he loves Rielle, though whether or not his feelings are romantic or purely platonic is left ambigous.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   The short story "Hands" revolves around a teacher who's been falsely accused of an affair with a student and run out of town.
-   Subverted in _We Need to Talk about Kevin_, in which the titular character claims his teacher made advances toward him. Though we only hear about the incident through an unreliable narrator, it is likely that nothing of the sort took place, and Kevin is just trying to get the teacher fired for the hell of it.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Subverted in _10 Things I Hate About You_; in order to shed her 'good-girl' image, Bianca fakes a rumor about her relationship with an older man, who is later thought to be the Geometry teacher, Mr. Ross. Things go too far, of course, and nobody believes that Bianca was lying. Mr. Ross never heard the rumor, but was revealed to, in fact, have a relationship with _another_ girl, and sent to prison.
-   Happens with almost disturbing frequency in _21 Jump Street_. It helps that Johnny Depp's character was in his mid-twenties, not actually a student, and in the most egregious example, met before he was actually assigned to her school.
-   At least half of the plots on _Boston Public_ consisted of this trope, or fake-outs (where it was revealed at the last minute that the relationship was a hoax).
-   There are indications of such feelings in Grissom and Sara's dialogue on _CSI_. They met when he was a lecturer at the college she was attending. But, they did not act on anything to do with those feelings until many years later, likely sparing both a lot of trouble.
-   _Franklin & Bash_ has episode dealing with this where the teacher unknowingly had a one-night stand with a student who seemed older. They met at a beach before she started teaching at his school, and took her to a bar so she thought he was over 21. Franklin has to defend her to the school board, and crushes on her a little during the case, leading to Bash invoking the page quote.
-   One episode of _The George Lopez Show_ addressed the Double Standard of this trope.
-   _Medium_: Indirectly causes a lot of emotional stress for psychic teen Ariel Dubois: Her college interviewer's dead husband fathered a child with one of his students, and asks Ariel to erase the file with incriminating photos on his (now his wife's) computer in exchange for a perfect interview with his wife. Ariel does so but then decides to do the right thing and restore the file. The interviewer returns to tell Ariel that she's going to help the baby financially, but unfortunately for Ariel's future, she also thinks that she planted the file after being dumped by her husband. Even the dead husband is stunned despite knowing what would happen. The very next episode, Ariel starts losing time _Futurama_\-style, jumping hours, then _years_ into the future where she's Happily Married to a friend from high school and they have an adorable daughter. She's certain the time-skips have to do with a teacher who was murdered right before the decade-long jump, and right before her mom is about to tell her how the teacher's kid ties into all this, she's thrown ahead another seven years — where her mother is _dead_, killed that same night. Desperate for answers, she goes to see the dead teacher's son, who's _the spitting image of high school sweetheart husband **who's about to kill her**_ — and then she wakes up, safe in the present and a few hours before her teacher's murder by her teenage baby daddy (he had a full-ride scholarship and wasn't about to risk it for his desperate ex-lover). Needless to say, after all that, Ariel really needs a hug.
-   _Modern Family_: After getting arrested for underaged drinking and assaulting a cop while at college, Haley must appear before a disciplinary board that will decide whether or not she will be expelled. She breaks down and confesses some of her misdeeds to the board. One of the things she confesses to is dating a teaching assistant, something that she apparently did twice. In the end, Haley is expelled from college.
-   One episode of _Shark_ involves characters theorizing that the motive a boy had for the murder of his father involved a sexual relationship with his art teacher. Stark quotes the public official alluded to the top of this article. The theory was inaccurate.
-   This was a category on _Win Ben Stein's Money_. As every category had a terrible pun for a name, this one was "Teachers Who Got Hot Under The Scholar".
-   There is an episode of _Yeralash_ where a boy prints photos of his female teacher. His father calls him a sycophant. However, right then, the teacher comes and complains the boy doesn't like her. They go into his room to show her wrong... turns out he's been using the photos as Dartboards of Hate. When one of the suction cup arrows intended for a photo sticks on the father's forehead, the mother's only response is "That'll teach you not to say our son's a sycophant".

    Theater 

-   In _Anne of Green Gables_, there is definitely something sexual going on between Mr. Phillips and Prissy Andrews. The dynamics of the relationship are never elaborated on, but a Teen Pregnancy and a Shotgun Wedding are implied as a result.
-   Happens in _The Sparrow_ between student-body president/cheerleading squad captain Jenny McGrath and biology teacher Mr. Christopher. Jenny goes into Mr. Christopher's room during the Homecoming Dance to confide in him, as she is jealous of Emily Book's popularity after she used her telekinetic powers to save Jenny from falling off the Greenview banner that hangs in the gym. Jenny giggles after receiving attention from Mr. Christopher, which reminds him of his dead wife. They slow-dance, which leads them to share a kiss.

-   Parodied in _Brütal Legend_. The Battle Nuns are latex-clad demonic nuns who talk like very, very naughty teachers to their demonic servants.

    Visual Novels 

-   Freeware game _don't take it personally babe, it just ain't your story_ takes many Shoujo and Visual Novel tropes and runs with them, and this one is no exception. However, by casting the Player Character as the teacher instead of the student, it allows the player to determine whether the Trope is Subverted, Averted, Deconstructed, or even _Reconstructed_. This works because the Teacher Student Romance student is, otherwise, the most emotionally well-adjusted member of the class.
-   In _Fate/hollow ataraxia_, Souichiro's wife Medea feels jealous of his students because they get to stare at him and listen to him talk for hours. (Then again, she feels jealous of everyone.) This is one of many things that alienates her from Shirou, an _actual_ student who knows how boring modern schools are and doesn't understand Medea's belief that her husband is the best guy on earth.

Cue cutaway to an algebra teacher slipping a student a note asking her "Do you like me? Yes? No? Maybe?" before grinning lecherously at her.
