_"I've many a time tried to the impossible task of washing away the memory of a sight that should never been seen. And let me tell you this: Febreeze in the eyes only brings more pain."_

A character has just witnessed something so icky, so unsettling, so horrific, so weird, that they must express their strong disapproval. This Is Wrong on So Many Levels! that a simple "That's gross" won't suffice — only Brain Bleach can make things right.

The character informs the world that the continued knowledge of this subject is an unbearable affront to their sanity. They will not be at peace until they can remove their brain from their skull, scrub the offending mental image out with steel wool and mental floss, then disinfect the entire area with bleach (disinfecting their eyes or ears with fire is optional).

In the sporking/MST/mocking community, there exists a derivative named _Bleeprin_ which is a mixture of industrial-strength Brain Bleach and Aspirin — Aspirin against the headache, Brain Bleach against the Badfic. Also Bleepka, which combines Brain Bleach and vodka. Its application is obvious.

Will probably be necessary after seeing No Yay, Glurge, Fetish Retardant, a Gainax Ending, a Shock Site, Rule 34, Squick, or Fan Disservice (among many other things), or hearing Too Much Information. Often the result of Schmuck Bait, so always remember that You Do Not Want To Know can be a helpful warning.

A Super-Trope to Screaming at Squick. Sometimes goes hand-in-hand with Nausea Fuel and Lost My Appetite. (Or _going_ to lose it, if the victim has already eaten.)

Compare with Scrubbing Off the Trauma (characters try to scrub away their guilt, disgust, or trauma), I Need a Freaking Drink (when characters want to get too blitzed to remember what they've seen), Kill It with Fire, These Are Things Man Was Not Meant to Know, Too Much Information, Schmuck Bait, or even its auditory cousin (Ear Worm).

For a literal application of this trope ("scrubbing" memories from the mind), see Laser-Guided Amnesia (although that trope usually isn't applied as a remedy for Squick). Despite the similar name, not to be confused with Brainwashed and related tropes.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _A Certain Magical Index_:
    -   During the "Freaky Friday" Flip incident, this is Touma's reaction to his mother in Index's body and wearing Barely-There Swimwear and Index in Aogami Pierce's body.
    -   In the manga version, when Touma's class is told there will be a new student, Touma tries to imagine who it will be. He inexplicably imagines Accelerator in a dress and freaks out.
-   A more serious example from _Berserk_: the last thing Guts saw with his right eye before it was gouged out during the Eclipse was his lover Casca being raped at the hands of his former best friend Griffith, now a powerful godlike demon named Femto. The image is burned into his memory.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   Chad throws up in his mouth a little after imagining Ichigo and Karin mashed together.
    -   Yumichika reacts to Charlotte Cuulhorne as if Cuulhorne's appearance is this. When trying to close his eyes to block out the horror fails, he decides the only solution is to wipe Charlotte out of existence.
-   _Buso Renkin_: Seeing Papillon wearing a mankini on the beach was enough to make Angel Gozen fall apart in shock and cause Ouka to scream in horror so loud that her nurses became concerned.
    
    **Ouka:** Somehow, I feel unbelievably frightened...
    
-   In the _Daily Lives of High School Boys_ skit "High School Boys and Panties", Motoharu pretty much cried out for brain bleach after peeping Ringo-chan's panties — not that her panties were any special, but out of Heel Realization about doing something that can't be undone. Specifically, he (and the rest of student council) _tricked Ringo into flaunting her panties_. There was so much Heroic BSoD that he skipped school for _three days_.
-   In _The Devil is a Part-Timer!_, the fat and Gonk landlady Miki-T mails a picture of herself in a bikini from her vacation in Hawaii to the main characters. It induces vomiting, fainting, Go Mad from the Revelation, etc.
-   Kleene Rutherford of _EDENS ZERO_ witnessed a godawful and traumatic experience as a child when the bastard lunatic scientist Dr. Mueller killed her parents all because her dad cut his research funding after learning of his crimes and he wanted revenge. Mueller then tied up Kleene and forced her to watch him _dissect her brother with a chainsaw_ until she emotionally broke. Kleene needed emotional inhibitors installed because any strong feeling would trigger PTSD. Sister Ivry had to digitize Kleene's memories and then do a deep dive to overwrite her suffering with comfort and delete her bad memories, curing her illness. As for Mueller, he got a very overdue beatdown.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   Mirajane decides to imagine what Elfman and Evergreen's child would look like, then is traumatized.
    -   In the first OVA, Natsu, Gray, and Gajeel accidentally see Makarov naked, with accompanying horror, disgust, and destruction. "My eyes!"
    -   Ohba Babasaama in a swimsuit gets this quote:
        
        **Chapati:** With that single strike, all the excitement in this arena has gone down the drain.  
        **Jason:** Cool down...
        
    -   Ichiya's fight in the Magic Games cause people to throw up.
    -   In the new series, Elfman gets a face full of Ichiya's "manhood". The poor guy resorts to beating his head on a rock just to get the awful image out.
        
        **Elfman (Japanese):** Dammit! I can't unsee his manhood!  
        **Elfman (English):** Maybe I can beat the horrible image out of my head! Get out NOW!!!
        
-   In _Gate_, this is Tomita's reaction when he is ordered to help Princess Piña and Bozes find yaoi manga.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   In _Battle Tendency_, Joseph had an interest in his Sexy Mentor Lisa Lisa, even peeping on her at one point. Near the end, Lisa Lisa told Joseph that she's actually his mother, which resulted in Joseph having a disgusted look and Thousand-Yard Stare throughout the whole credits.
    -   In _Stardust Crusaders_, Polnareff is bewildered to learn that a local Indian restaurant's bathroom had a pig pin built directly beneath the bathroom and the pigs come up from the toilet for food. The implications were not lost on him, and it gets worse when one of the staff tells Polnareff that their manager actually likes having his butt licked by the pigs.
-   Azusa of _K-On!_ reacts this way to a video of an unfortunate Panty Shot incident at the band's previous performance; in the English dub, she actually says "I can't unsee it!"
-   In _Love Lab_, this is nearly everyone's reaction to Maki's father (who owns a lingerie company) singing a song about how much he loves lingerie. However, Sayori thinks the song is amusing and also sings it, to the other's further displeasure.
-   In _My Bride is a Mermaid_, Lunar's dad, Sun's dad, and Masa cross-dress, freaking out everybody. Lunar's dad continues to do it in later episodes.
-   In _My Dad's the Queen of All VTubers?!_, Takashi finds out the Awful Truth that Kizuke Yai, the Virtual Celebrity he's been fawning over is actually his own father. He desperately wishes that he can go back to the time when ignorance is bliss, since every time he sees Kizuke Yai, all he can see now is his father's face.
-   In _My Monster Secret_, Youko's father asks Asahi what he'd do if, hypothetically, he came home one day and saw his father dressed like a woman; Asahi's response is "WHAT ARE YOU MAKING ME IMAGINE?!", which is coupled with an Imagine Spot of him and his sister Mei looking on in abject horror as Mr. Kuromine reads the newspaper while wearing a sundress and pigtails.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Most of the male crewmembers suppressed their memories of seeing Kokoro in her mermaid form, which is later acknowledged when Zoro claims Camie was the first mermaid he met. This is lampshaded by Chopper, who notices that Zoro's memories about Kokoro disappear when he meet Camie.
    -   Sanji gets a two years long one when he discovers himself in the Okama Island.
    -   A serious example is implied with Admiral Fujitora's blindness, which was apparently self-inflicted because he didn't want to see any more of the world's evils. Whatever sent him over that particular edge must've been quite awful.
-   _Rebuild World_:
    -   Alpha floats a hypothetical situation where a hunter discovers the ruins an Old World fashion designer's workshop. Should they find a lot of maid uniforms there, they might sell the uniforms for cheap, not knowing that they're even more effective than the latest hunter armor. Akira then has the Imagine Spot of huge, brawny guys marching into a ruin in maid uniforms and asks her to not destroy his common sense.
    -   In a later Call-Back to this conversation, Shirakabe pleads with Nojima to get high quality maid armor for Drankam from the company the Ninja Maid sisters Shiori and Kanae do, since it's better than their current armor. This leads to the idea of The Big Guy Old Soldier Kurosawa wearing such an outfit, to Nojima's horror.
-   In the New Year's chapter of _Sgt. Frog_, Fuyuki reads a New Year's postcard for his mom;
    
    **Fuyuki:** "Dear Aki-San, here's hoping that next year's panties will be snake skin. (Pant pant)" I wish I hadn't read that.
    
-   In _Shakugan no Shana_, Shana is disgusted when Sorath and Tiriel make out in front of her, ranting that it is not the kind of kissing Chigusa taught her about.
-   In an episode of _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_, the old and fat Ms. Dorothy/Tomoe-san cosplays as Dark Magician Girl. Nobody is pleased. Except Hayato/Chumly — it was _his_ idea for her to cosplay the character, though she's confused as to why she's doing that. It also causes her to get stuck in the costume because it's too tight.

    Card Games 

-   This card from _Magic: The Gathering_ is a creature which acts as Brain Bleach for its master.

    Comic Books 

-   _Amelia Rules!_: Amelia is kind enough to offer the readers time to apply Brain Bleach to erase what images Ninja Joan's story about how she caught her fellow ninjas skinny dipping might have conjured in their minds:
    
    **Ninja Joan:** They were N-U-D-E naked, and swimming in this pond. So I get an eyeful of this scene, and like, totally freak. _Aaagh! My eyes! My eyes!_ So they all go running behind this shrub, screaming _Get out of here! Get out!_  
    **Amelia:** Wait a second, if they were in the water and then behind a shrub, you didn't _really_ see anything, right?  
    **Ninja Joan:** Weeell... it was a very _small_ shrub.  
    _\[beat\]_  
    **Amelia:** _\[voice over\]_ Why don't I give you a minute to erase that horrible image... Okay, ready?
    
-   _Astonishing X-Men_ has a few during Joss Whedon's run, the most specifically invoking this trope being:
-   In one issue of Marvel's _Captain Marvel_ that took place when Genis-Val was the current title bearer, the Kree Supreme Intelligence (a giant, disembodied head in a jar) boasted that it could do anything. Genis challenged it to pick its nose. One Beat Panel later, everyone in the room said that they were now permanently mentally scarred.
-   _Deadpool_:
    -   Deadpool wearing Marvel Girl's leggy costume. Considering he's horribly disfigured....
        
        **Cyclops:** He'll change his mind, right, Hank?  
        **Beast:** Give it six seconds, Scott.  
        **Cyclops:** That's an eternity right now.
        
    -   In _Deadpool_ #0 (a _Wizard_ giveaway), Wade stumbles upon a plot by Arnim Zola where he's cloned several dead heroes and villains (all of them C-List Fodder) and had actually been enjoying himself... up to the point when he uncovered the proto-husks of Aunt May and Uncle Ben. Who were old. And _naked._ After pumping the "unholy liver spots" full of lead, he proceeds to go on this rant:
        
        **Deadpool:** It's _one_ thing to bring back a bunch of _wannabe wiseguys_ to _life_ and hurl them in my direction... but when I get _snookered_ into grabbing an _eyeful_ of two... _naked... old... old..._ people... _someone's gonna **DIE!**_
        
-   _Empowered_: After having her suit stolen by an (ahem) a less-than-attractive guy, Empowered's thought bubbles read as follows:
    
    **Emp:** Image... _scarred_ into... forebrain... _**Scarred**_...
    
-   Victor from _Runaways_ can actually do this to himself, being a Ridiculously Human Robot. He's damn lucky. Specifically, after a super-powered game of truth or dare leads to the team fighting a giant snake monster, he asks Karolina if she'd really _never_ consider being with a guy, even for "...the perks". Karolina replies "No", and that he picked the _worst_ time to ask that. One Beat Panel later...
    
    **Chase:** AAAAGH! WHY? Why would you make me picture that?  
    **Victor:** \[Are you sure you want to delete selected memory?\]
    
-   _Sam & Max: Freelance Police_: Max, in the previous panel having been unarmed, is suddenly waving around a rather large firearm. Sam asks, "Where did you have that thing hidden, li'l buddy?" Max's response exemplifies this trope: "None of your damn business."
-   _The Simpsons Futurama Crossover Crisis_: The heroes try to distract the giant Homer by using a giant TV that shows Marge holding pork chops:
    
    **Leela:** It's working! He's hugging the TV. _\[looking disgusted\]_ Now he's **kissing** the TV.  
    **Bender:** Now he's...Ew! _\[covering his eyes\]_ Well that's one building **I'm** never going into again!
    
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   In _The Amazing Spider-Man (J. Michael Straczynski)_, Peter visits L.A and accidentally sees a man (a rather heavy-set man, no less) cross-dressed in _lingerie_. He thinks to himself:
        
        **Peter:** Just keep going, Peter, it's nothing that gouging out your eyes and washing them in sulphuric acid won't fix...
        
    -   Peter goes to shower after seeing J. Jonah Jameson Sr. in bed with his Aunt May in _The Amazing Spider-Man (1999)_ #592.
-   A truly horrific example: Alan Moore's "Love and Death" arc of _Swamp Thing_ starts with Abby Arcane Cable ripping off her clothes, trying unsuccessfully to burn them ("She had become a little crazy by this time.") showering heavily and then scrubbing herself bloody with a wire brush after she learns that her husband Matt is really an animated corpse containing the spirit of her evil uncle Anton Arcane. Unintended necrophilia and incest? Yeah, all the brain bleach in the world won't wash that away.
    
    _And she thinks, "How long have I been married to...?" And she thinks, "How many times did...?" And she knows what the bad thing is, and where the stench is coming from._
    
    -   To give people ample warning on that spoiler: scrubbing her flesh until she passes out with horror and blood loss is so far removed from what's under the spoiler, that people reading the comic frequently forget that poor Abby likely mutilated herself in an unsuccessful attempt to get clean after her realization. You have been warned.
-   A minor example with Wonder Man in _Uncanny Avengers_: he gets released from Rogue when she kisses Deadpool and absorbs his Healing Factor. Beast explains how the process works, says that the skin-to-skin contact made it possible and is surprised that it took Rogue so long to finally slap Deadpool. Wonder Man then says that he'd give every dollar for his brain to remember it like that.
-   _West Coast Avengers (2018)_: In issue #2, Quentin Quire and Gwenpool's argument over _Weekend at Bernie's_ devolves into the two of them making out. America Chavez and Fuse are utterly horrified.
    
    **America:** I... have seen Quentin Quire making out with someone... That's my reality now. I can never go back.  
    **Fuse:** It's like the image is burned into my retinas. No matter how much I blink... there it is.
    
-   In the _Wolverine_ story arc in which he goes to Hell, there is a scene in which Emma Frost enters his mind and walks through a door marked "My Sexual Fantasies"; apparently, Logan's fantasy is a six-way involving Emma, Mystique, Psylocke, Spiral, and _Squirrel Girl_. Emma's reaction is: "Where... Where are those demons when you need them? I must **die** this instant."
-   In _Action Comics_ #1051, Jon, trying to find more board games for Otho-Ra and Osul-Ra to play with, discovers Superman's Warzoon outfit hanging in the closet. When he calls out for his mom to figure out what's going on, Lois _races in and shuts the closet door_ and directs Jon to where the games are. It takes Jon a brief moment to realize what that outfit is used for now and he turns away, hiding his embarrassed and horrified face.
    
    **Jon**: Ohhhhhhh, my God.

-   _Doonesbury_: The July 24, 2016 Sunday strip shows the entire ensemble struck dumb with horror at the outcome of the Republican National Convention,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  until:

    **Mike**: We can't. We take it to our graves.
    
-   The August 17, 2023 strip of _Garfield_ has Garfield watch a movie titled _Santa's Summer Vacation_.

    **Leopold**: (_To Owen_) IT’S NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH!
    
-   _Zits_:
    -   There's a moment like this in one strip where a bored Jeremy complains that "nothing ever happens around here," which prompts his dad to take his shirt off and dance around (all 300-some pounds of him) singing, "Shake your bon-bon!" Afterward, Jeremy goes to wash his eyeballs out.
    -   In another example, Jeremy peeks around the corner only to catch his mother in a leotard practicing for her Zumba dance class (with her boobs jiggling in the air). He promptly asks his dad if there's a way to erase an image burned into his retina.
    -   And the time his mother commented on Stairway to Heaven, which he was strumming on his guitar: his parents had that song playing when he was conceived. Cue Jeremy with his head under the tap, running hot water into his ear.
    -   This happened to his mom too in one strip. After she commented that a song he was listening to was "catchy", he showed her the lyrics. In the final panel, he told his dad, "I'm grounded for buying a CD and Mom is at church for liking it."

    Fan Works 

-   In chapter 1 of _A Complete Turnabout_, Phoenix gets a mental image of himself in Franziska von Karma's clothes. He almost choked himself from that idea.

-   The infamous invisible clothes in _Adoption Nightmare_ have Danny wishing he had some.
-   This alternate-universe drabble for the _TRON_ universe.
-   Invoked in chapter 18 of the semi-self-insert _Touhou Project_ Fanfic _Average Joe In Bullet Hell_, though the image in Ryan's mind was not really all that icky, unsettling, or horrific — merely of questionable healthiness.
    
    **Utsuho:** _\[referring to Nitori\]_ She's really shy! It's so cute! You have to see it sometime!  
    **Ryan:** _\[thoughts\]_ Well, now you have a whole bunch of images of shy lolis running through my mind. Oh, that can _not_ be healthy. Brain bleach, gooooooo!  
    **\[THWACK!\]**  
    **Utsuho:** Ah! Y-you just punched yourself!  
    **Ryan:** _\[thoughts\]_ Yep. Brain bleach tastes suspiciously like copper, by the way.
    
-   In _A Very Kara Christmas_, Jimmy Olsen accidentally drops his cup of coffee right on co-worker Frank Potts' groin.

She starts begging Rook not to leave her her alone, because then she'll start stress-eating and end up gaining over 1000 pounds, and then none of her (rather revealing) clothes will fit her. Kevin, horrified at the vivid imagery, begs Rook to slow down and let Sceles catch up with him.
-   _The Darwin Chronicles_:
    -   In "Great Scott", Logan making disparaging comments about Scott causes Jean to rave about her fulfilling sex life, which makes her audience demand a mind-wipe or lobotomy.
        
        **Jean:** "You know, I don't think there's a room in this mansion where we haven't done it."  
        **Hank:** Jean, please.  
        **Jean:** His office, my office, the lab, the kitchen, the music room. The den, the classrooms, the stables, the hangar – now that was exceptional. Scott really does love that jet.  
        **Bobby:** Do you think the Professor would wipe out my memory? I mean, if I asked him nicely? Or begged really, really hard?
        
    -   In "What lies beneath", Logan hates the fact that his healing factor won't let him kill himself when Rogue and Jubilee start discussing Scott's underwear.
        
        There were times, Logan reflected, when having a healing factor was a bitch.  
        When flu swept through the mansion, leaving people puking everywhere, who got to play nursemaid? When a mission went awry, who did Jean race past without a second glance as she went to fuss over the Boy Wonder?  
        Worst of all, when Rogue and Jubilee got caught stealing Cyclops' underwear, who was unable to slit his wrists to avoid hearing why?
        
    -   In "Osmosis", Logan's healing factor will not save him from Jubilee's ramblings.
        
        **Jubilee:** And then Lola was all pissed, I dunno, I think it gave her a headache or something, and she blamed Dr. Grey and pissed somewhere – like, that cat is so, whattyacall it, literal – and Dr. Grey was all pissed and at least she's not all literal because God, wouldn't that be gross if she started –  
        **Logan:** You know, the healing factor don't mean I can't get headaches, kid.

-   _Doing It Right This Time_: When the cast discovers Kaworu has also returned… gender-swapped, Asuka casually states — after the initial shock:
    
    **Asuka:** Although it was sweet of you to think of a gift like that for the two of us. _\[long, awkward silence\]_ What? \[Shinji\] always enjoys the show when Rei and I-  
    **Gendo and Ritsuko:** Too much information!  
    _\[another long, awkward silence\]_  
    **Ritsuko:** I think that's the first thing we've agreed on since I found out you did my mom.
    
-   When the Madrigals are in combat with Stoick's party in _The Dragon and the Butterfly_, a heavily armed Tuffnut gangs up on Bruno. At that moment, Bruno has a vision, telling him that his sister will get together with Fishlegs. Tuffnut is so horrified by this revelation, he faints.
-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_:
    -   The Solar Flare induces nauseating images for both its victims and the audience.

    -   Vegeta gags when he finds out that Dodoria is a woman. Her explaining how she was the most beautiful and fertile woman on her home planet and offering Vegeta to team up against Freeza and rule the universe as husband and wife makes it worse.
    -   Bulma asks for a glass when she sees Zarbon transform.
        
        **Bulma:** We'll live in a penthouse suite... and he'll drive a Corvette... and we'll make love every single— _\[Zarbon finishes transforming\]_ KILL IT WITH FIRE!!
        
    -   Piccolo audibly shudders when, in an attempt to telepathically contact Gohan, he ends up picking up Vegeta wanting to strip down naked in front of a mirror and go Super Saiyan.
-   _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_:
    -   In the story "Smurfette's Inner Beauty", when Empath, Brainy, and Duncan McSmurf follow Hogatha to a Wizard's Ball after her magical makeover:
        
        **Empath:** It seems that Hogatha wants Harlequin to spend a night with her in her castle.  
        **Duncan:** That's certainly a picture that I don't want smurfing in my head, laddie.
        
    -   Sassette says she'd have this if Tapper was serving it in his tavern to make her forget about ever hearing about Empath and Polaris "sharing dreams" with each other in "Flowerbell's Love Triangle."
-   _Evangelion 303_: In chapter 15, Mari and Kelly are taunting each other about their sex lives as having some drinks in Pancho's.

-   In the fanfiction The Evillous Chronicles of the fandom of the same name, Elluka says she definitely needs a memory-wiping spell when Venomania has sex with Lukana.

-   _Harry Potter_ fanfics:
    
    -   In _Daphne Greengrass and the Boy Who Lived_:
        -   Harry and Daphne are left uncomfortable when Moody uses his eye to comment on Harry's socks, since that means he's basically using his eye to look under teenagers' robes.
        -   While Ron is relatively understanding of Harry, Ginny and Daphne dating each other once they begin their three-person relationship, he explicitly asks that the girls not discuss what they might do when they're alone together over the holidays as he doesn't want to picture his sister doing such things. He's particularly vehement about this request when Daphne and Ginny talk about their first sexual encounter with each other in the Room of Requirement in Harry's sixth year.
    -   In _The Girl Who Loved_, Harry falls into a Jusenkyō spring shortly after _Sailor Moon_ drowned in it. Her spirit comes out of the pool and after spotting girl-Harry and briefly thinking how hot her body looks on someone else, she equates it to perving on your twin and wonders if ghosts can use brain bleach.
    -   In _The Problem With Purity_ Fawkes suggests poisoning Ron in his sleep after he makes a particularly crass remark to Hermione.
        
        **Hermione:** But sadly, if we poisoned everyone who annoyed me, the wizarding population would be decimated in no time. You don't want to be responsible for the destruction of the wizarding world, do you?  
        **Harry:** From poisoning Ron to the death of the wizarding world. I know the Weasleys are prolific, but that's a scary leap.  
        **Hermione:** Harry, I positively refuse to think of him as the father of the wizarding world and may have to go wash my brain out with soap at the thought.
        
    -   In _An Elf's Lament_ Harry has a brief vision of Draco, Dumbledore and Santa Claus in a threesome and wonders if he can bleach his own brain.
    -   In _One Wizard Too Many_ Harry and Hermione discuss a suitable location to submerge the golden egg. When she mentions she's heard that the "price of admission" to Dumbledore's private Jacuzzi is "a bit steep" Harry replies "Ugh, need some brain bleach here!" In a later chapter, after Harry says he'll be sending her his psychologist's bill and she comments that a hug from a load-bearing column she transfigured into a likeness of Molly Weasley will "make it all better" he replies "Okay, now that's the psychologist's bill and an invoice for some brain bleach you'll owe me."
    -   _Having a Moste Potente Valentine's Day_:
    
    **Harry:** We might need to see about getting a therapist for Winky. Alpaca girl dressed in a see-through negligee bound to a desk chair? That's got to leave an image.  
    **Hermione:** We might need to get her a bottle of brain bleach from Poppy.
    
    -   In _The Fabulous Eccentricities of Bertie Botts_ McGonagall is overheard asking Madame Pomfrey to obliviate her memory of a banner bearing the caption "Taste the rainbow!" and a naked picture of Dumbledore.
    -   In _Harry Potter and the Fate We Make_ Harry has a vision of one of Voldemort's attacks and then wonders if there's such a thing as a shower for your brain.
    -   In _Veela heart_ Sirius, Remus, Arthur and Snape accidentally witness Harry and Lucius making out and Snape mutters about "getting Albus to erase the memory, and perhaps some brain bleach."
        -   A chapter earlier, after it comes out that Charlie Weasley is Draco's mate, this exchange occurs:
            
            **Sirius:** What is with all these weird pairings? Next you will be telling me McGonagall and Trelawney are together!  
            _\[Beat\]_  
            **Harry:** Oh ew! I can't get that image out of my head now!  
            **Sirius:** I think I just scarred myself.  
            **Albus:** For Merlin's sake, no one mention this to Minerva! We will all suffer!  
            **Lucius:** It was an image I could have done without.
            
    -   In _Harry Potter and the Wizard's Oath_ after a naked Dumbledore is spontaneously transported to the hospital wing, Hermione asks Madame Pomfrey if the wizarding world has an equivalent to psychotherapy because she "felt she had seen something that may scar her for life."
    -   In _Dear Order_ Harry mentions in a letter that he could use the robes Dumbledore sent him for his birthday as a defense against Death Eaters someday because "_no one_ can see electric blue robes with pineapples and bananas on them and remain unscarred," prompting Ron to reply "I can't even _imagine_ them and remain unscarred."
    -   In _Surrender_ many students find themselves wanting an obliviate after Harry and Tom dose the Hogwarts staff with veritaserum:
        
        **Professor Snape:** Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's odd... Why is it that I can no longer read your thoughts, Mr. Malfoy? Have you been practicing occlumency over the summer? I wouldn't have thought someone of your normally paltry intellect capable of such a thing. Not that I'm complaining, mind you; it is rather a relief not to risk accidentally picking up on your ridiculous fantasies about certain of your classmates in the middle of my class. I do wish the rest of you would practice occlumency as well, but I suppose that is too much to hope for. I cannot help sensing your perverted daydreams when you are supposed to be paying attention in class. Being a legilimens is really more of a curse than a blessing when one is teaching teenagers. I must admit that some of your fantasies are mildly entertaining and good for a laugh, but several of them are rather disturbing. My detentions are not _nearly_ as interesting as some of you seem to imagine. I am also growing terribly weary of centaur fantasies - that goes for you, Miss Patil, Miss Brown, Miss Parkinson, _and_ Mr. Goyle. As for you, Mr. Longbottom, _nobody_ should do that with a plant. And Mr. Weasley... Oh, that's just _preposterous!_ _Obliviate!_  
        **Ron:** Thank you, sir. I feel a lot better now. Wait - what happened?
        
    -   In _Growing Up Kneazle_ Harry happens to see Crookshanks getting...amorous...with Mrs. Norris and leaves "in an attempt to find caustic chemicals to cleanse his eyes." In the sequel, _Teenage Mutant Ninja Kneazles_, a repeat performance "afforded Harry the opportunity to avoid Filch and gave him another good reason to poke his eyes out with a blunted letter opener."
    -   In _Altered Histories_ while attending the Quidditch World Cup Harry spots an extremely fat _man_ wearing a hot pink miniskirt, lime green tube top and leopard-print stilettos.
        
        **Harry:** Curse my perfect memory and immunity to obliviation!
        
    -   In _Like a Phoenix from the Ashes_ Ginny accidentally walks in on Ron and Hermione having sex and comments to Harry afterwards that she "was going to scrub her eyeballs after seeing her brother naked."
    -   In _Soulsong_ Pansy walks into the Slytherin common room after accidentally seeing Ron and Hermione having sex and spots Draco flirting with Charlie over the Floo.
        
        **Pansy:** I am going to pretend I am not seeing this because I already need eye bleach.
        
    -   In _Wicked Serendipity_ Harry accidentally sees a naked Lucius.
        
        **Harry:** I fucking need bleach. Merlin, my poor innocent eyes.
        
    -   In _Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts_ the disclaimer for X-ray glasses on special offer by the _Quibbler_ states in part:
        
        Using _Quibbler_ Technology X-Ray Specs around certain individuals may lead to nausea, loss of sexual desire and a general need to scrub out your braincase with bleach.
        
    -   In _Harry the Draagyr_ the Gryffindor sixth-year boys' dorm is treated to Dean and Seamus talking dirty to each other and then running for the showers while clad in a sheet.
        
        **Ron:** I think I'm going to go cast some Cleaning Charms on my eyeballs now.
        
    -   In _Tripping Through Time_ a time-traveling Iris Potter decides to adopt a then six-year-old Tom Riddle. She has some interesting thoughts while shopping for a training wand in a children's store.
        
        _Creepy.  
        Extremely creepy.  
        So creepy and disturbing that I want to Obliviate myself._
        
    -   In _Simplicity_ Madame Pomfrey has to treat a specialized freezing spell cast on Draco's genitals.
        
        **Madame Pomfrey:** Dear lord! I hope that is just the cold making it shrink. Otherwise, I need to go burn out my eyes and then obliviate myself!
        
    -   In _Water Aerobics for the Aquaphobic_, Voldemort witnesses Umbridge and Filch passionately getting at it. Meanwhile, Harry has a Department of Mysteries dream, and the crystal balls are crying and saying: "My eyes! My eyes!"
    -   In _Of Lies and Deceit and Hidden Personas_ Harry _begs_ Voldemort to obliviate him after seeing a _Daily Prophet_ photo of Aberforth Dumbledore having sex with his brother Albus while the latter is in his goat Animagus form.
    -   In _Blue Steel_ Dumbledore asks Fawkes to bring Sirius to a meeting; the latter is wearing only a Speedo at the time.
        
        **Mad-Eye Moody:** I'm going to have to wash my \[artificial\] eye in bleach now. One of the benefits of it is that I can literally do that.
        
    -   _Nightmare_:
        
        **Seamus:** I just walked in on Hermione and Ron having sex.  
        **Harry:** Oh that's just revolting.  
        **Seamus:** Yeah just be warned it sounded like they have some pranks that they wanted to try out on you. Now if you'll excuse me I have to take a scouring pad to my eyeballs and if I can manage my brain.
        
-   _Hellsing Ultimate Abridged_ has a case when Alucard and _the Queen of England_ have an incredibly filthy conversation that contains many Crosses the Line Twice moments in front of a council of her advisers and allies. Sir Penwood screams "I can never have sex again!" in horror at their conversation, and we can't blame him.
    
    **"Betty":** Well, well, well if it isn't Ally. Your skin is still as smooth as the days I felt it against my own.  
    **Alucard:** You know it. Reminds me of when I'd keep your bed warm during the Blitz.  
    **"Betty":** Ah, those were better days. I was younger, beautiful...  
    **Alucard:** Shut up you old hag, I'd still wreck you like Dianna!  
    **"Betty":** (Slight dark chuckle) Oh, you always know just what to say to moisten me up...  
    **Penwood:** AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I can never have sex again!
    
-   _Here There Be Monsters_: Since Dr. Sivana's scheme to destroy the Marvels and conquer the world is apparently going to succeed this time, the Acrobat suggests that the Monster Society of Evil do something nice for their boss... like getting him laid. Illyria retorts she did not need that mental image.
    
    **The Acrobat:** "All things considered, I think we should show our appreciation to the boss. Name a country after him. Maybe give him a federal treasury–you know, not a big one, just maybe one from some little island somewhere. Get him laid. He'd appreciate that."  
    **Illyria:** (wrinkling her nose) "There are some things even too sickening for me to contemplate, and that, Acrobat, is one of them. No, thank you."
    
-   In _The Hill of Swords_, Louise has this reaction after seeing her sister acting out a sexual fantasy while calling Shirou's name.
-   In _Hotspring Souls!_, the guys are all traumatized when they see Solaire's swimsuit— an excruciatingly tight and eye-searingly bright yellow speedo with a red sun logo smack dab in the crotch area.
    
    **Hunter:** "Oh man... Maybe Father Gascoigne had the right idea to gouge his own eyes out..."
    
-   In _Imaginary Seas_, this is Percy's reaction to realizing that cannibalism is a recurring thing in Greek mythology after Chiron reveals his plan to absorb his Lostbelt counterpart for power and information.
    
    **Percy:** Cannibalism kind of ran in the family, anyway. —Oh _gods._ I didn’t need that thought. I did _not_ need that thought.
    
-   In _Kitsune no Ken: Fist of the Fox_, this is Kakuzu's reaction when he finds out that Hidan, who's been stalking his ex-girlfriend relentlessly, has actually gone inside the woman's house when she's not there and has had masturbated on her bed.
    
    **Kakuzu:** Damn it, now I'll have to drink drain cleaner to get that imagery out of my head.
    
-   Just The Three Of Us has Anne's reaction to her and her girlfriends accidentally opening an envelope of what they thought were love poems written between her parents and instead being sexy photos of her mother for her father, some of which were pretty recent. Anne was very quickly left on the floor, screaming about her eyes never being clean again, not helped by Sasha and Marcy joking about how her mom was still pretty hot after twenty-five years of marriage.
-   In _Entwined Destinies: The Last Son And The Slayer_, The Scoobies walk in on Buffy Summers and Clark Kent in bed together and are horrified, except for Faith.
    
    **Faith:** Oh my god! Did you see that guy? All those muscles?  
    **Giles:** Yes and I would like to purge that memory as quickly as possible, thank you Faith.
    
-   In _The Legend of Total Drama Island_, the following invocations (from separate incidents) are typical:
    
    **Bridgette:** \[H\]ow about keeping us in suspense on that, okay? That’s a mental image I so don’t need right now.  
    **Leshawna:** If I even see one, I feel like I need a shower.
    
-   In _Life Ore Death_ Artemis needs this after she's in the library and overhears Superboy being given The Talk from their older teammate. She stumbles out pale, finds Wally, and he Zeta Tubes them to Vietnam, which has no drinking age, so Intoxication Ensues.
-   Often invoked to no avail in the "Sailor Horus" continuity of _Lovehammer Inc_.
-   From the Gag Sub of _Mahou Sentai Magiranger: The Movie_
-   In the _RWBY_ fic _Massages_, Jaune tries to ask Professor Port for advice on how to deal with his Unwanted Harem problem, only for Port to instead tell him tales of his previous sexual encounters. Jaune is soon begging to die, because he can't get Port to shut up, until he is rescued by Glynda Goodwitch's arrival.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfics:
    -   Due to its infamous nature, _Cupcakes (Sergeant Sprinkles)_ tends to appear in other fanfics as a story In-Universe, a nightmare of one of the characters, or a horror movie. Most of the time, it'll get this reaction from the characters who witnessed it in some way, shape, or form.
    -   In a meta example, _The Light in the Darkness_ has gained a reputation among the fandom for being used as effective Brain Bleach if one is still suffering psychological trauma from reading _Cupcakes_.
    -   Another example in _Once Bitten, Twice Shy_. After Applejack learns…through experiment… the significance of a unicorn's horn, she sprints away from Rarity planning to scrub clean her hoof _and_ her brain. It takes the poor girl several pages before she can look a unicorn in the face without flinching.
    -   After exposure to several dozen gigabytes of the most depraved forms of clopfic imaginable, Arthur Arcturus is relieved beyond description to find a CD labeled _Brain Bleach_ and full of pictures of flowers and fuzzy kittens.
    -   In _Estrus_, Rarity finds out that Twilight doesn't know what being "in heat" means, and gathers Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie and Applejack in the Carousel Boutique to discuss how to break it to her. The resulting conversation covers how each of them learned about the birds and bees, their first times in heat, and how each chooses to deal with the symptoms. Rarity has this to say about it:
        
        **Rarity:** Step lively now! The sooner we get to Twilight's and teach her about the facts of life, the sooner we can all go our separate ways and clop or _stab ourselves in the eyes_ or whatever it is we need to do.
        
    -   In _Address Unknown (Remedy)_, Rainbow Dash comes by the library and learns that Twilight fell asleep while studying and left a mess on the floor, which Spike is now cleaning up. She recognizes the smell for what it is, and then she learns that Twilight's been spending time with Derpy the last few days...
        
        Derpy plus Twilight should NOT equal that mess on the floor, but yet there it was — if they had been spending a lot of time together, then this… Her brain forced an image into her head that made her wish that heads came with an "un-see" button.
        
    -   In _Filly Willies_, Twilight unearths a collection of books, one of which is a "spicy sugar story" written by Mrs. Cake. Twilight asks what something means, and Spike whispers his answer to her.
        
        **Twilight:** What? Are you sure? That's. . . Just wrong. Okay, this obviously isn't part of the set. Can you put that away somewhere out of sight? Actually, just go ahead and burn it. And remind me to look up an amnesia spell in the morning.
        
    -   A non-squicky version appears in _Turnabout Storm_. Before the trial starts, Phoenix wonders what his Friendly Rival Edgeworth would do if he was in his shoes (that is, stuck in Equestria). Cue a mental image of Edgeworth gleefully playing with the ponies:
        
        **Edgeworth:** This is just like that one episode of the _Steel Samurai_ where he meets the Pink Princess! _**WHEEEEEEE!!!!**_  
        _\[Back to the real world\]_  
        **Phoenix:** (Doctor, I'd like the part of my brain responsible for that image lobotomized, please...)
        
    -   _Pony POV Series_:
        -   The Dark World!Mane Six release Celestia and Luna from their prison only for them both having been reduced to fillies and Celestia having lost her memory and thinks she just came back from Paradise Estate where Discord was actually good. After she's told that the heroes woke her up from a long sleep, she has the following response:
            
            **Filly Celestia:** Did they have Dissy kiss me?  
            **Luna:** WHAT?! NO!  
            **Filly Celestia:** Well... The prince always wakes up his princess with a kiss, and they're calling us princesses, or I think they are, so—  
            **Twilight:** _\[narrating\]_ I needed a memory erasure spell.
            
        -   Another example from Shining Armor's story: Private Ranger is asking around for advice for his next date with Sunset. He gets some good advice from Shining and Ellis, but when he asks The Lord Flashheart... well, he ends up getting permission to have the conversation _erased from his memory_.
        -   Shining Armor needs this when it is suggested that his enemy Makarov, who has the power to alter the timeline, altered things so that they share the same mother. He needs this again when he sees a vision of the night his parents conceived him.
        -   Spike is utterly horrified when Silver Spoon tells him what a bachelor party is about.
        -   During the Wedding Arc, Pinkie Pie takes down a Changeling by using her 4th wall breaking powers to produce a piece of fan art of Queen Chrysalis and Discord together. The Changeling screams and collapses, clutching his eyes.
        -   While Princess Luna is teaching Applejack about the Centaur race, this is Applejack's reaction when Luna describes a Centaur orgy. Given this story involves Lord Tirek, one of the most brutal, evil, monstrous Evil Overlords to have ever lived, this is not the only time Applejack ends up feeling like this.
    -   _Mirror's Image_: Whatever it is that Twilight Sparkle learns about Changeling reproduction, it's bad enough to make her wipe her own memory, _twice_. It didn't help that after the first time she asked what the Changeling Queen had been talking about.
    -   _The Flash Sentry Chronicles_: Springer actually _wants_ this to happen to him after he spies on Rainbow's house and sees her and Soarin do _something_ together.
        
        **Springer:** Memory, please fail me now.
        
-   _Naru-Hina Chronicles Mini-sodes_:
    -   This is Sakura's reaction when she comes to the conclusion that Naruto might enjoy it a little too much whenever she physically hurts him.
    -   Naruto and Hinata decide to check up on Tsunade given that she's been focused on trying to help the still unconscious Jiraiya so much. When Naruto opens the door, he and his girlfriend see Tsunade sitting on top of Jiraiya, with her vest revealing her bare right shoulder as if like she was about to have sex with him. She notices the presence of the young ninjas before saying "I'm... checking his vitals..." The Uzumaki then closes the door without entering the room. Both he and Hinata are stunned while he, after saying earlier on that he doesn't want to see Tsunade sad, comments that he didn't want to see that either.
-   _Naruto: The Abridged Series_: Gaara's response to Rock Lee and Guy's student-teacher bonding: "Wow. I think I'm gonna need mind soap."
-   Lobotomies, mindwipes and the like are on high demand at _The Official Fanfiction University Of Middle-earth_ due to the staff's "learning through mental scarring" teaching methods.
    
    **Legolas:** I was chased by Elvea and Sauronette when one opened just in front of them, and they fell down into the Uruk-hai breeding caverns.  
    **Elrond:** Oh, so that was the loud-pitched scream I heard about 'need acid to remove my eyes'?
    
-   A Running Gag (and theme) in _Of Love and Bunnies_ is that Kira and her teammates find it very hard to see their mentor, Tommy, as a person, much less a person with a sex life. As such, they frequently try to unsee things they have seen. Including the entire original Power Rangers team (It Makes Sense in Context) doing the Tootsie Roll in the middle of the sidewalk.
-   In _Opening Dangerous Gates_, everybody is disgusted whenever Gray strips.
-   In the Transformers multi-canon fic _Riding a Sunset_, the Autobots are confused by what Charlie means when she says she's going to the restroom, and why she got defensive when Jazz asked if she wanted him to come with her. Ratchet then gives an impromptu lecture to the Autobots on the functions of the human body. They are all left embarrassed and horrified. Even Optimus Prime.
-   Done twice in Episode 4 of _Rise of the Galeforces_. The second time, in which the Big Bad dies horribly _in front of the entire cast and in fact, **the entirety of human civilization**_, requires everyone with the exception of Adam and Violet to get their memories wiped. Kim and Chell weren't kidding when they pointed out that in the aftermath, memory stations became a very big business.
-   _There Was Once an Avenger From Krypton_: In _Changing of the Guard_, Ben finds himself wishing for some brain bleach after Krabb mistakes Gwen for Ben's mate even after being told that they're cousins.
-   _The Second Try_: In chapter 3, Misato gets up to her old tricks and asks Shinji, Asuka, and Rei if they went for a threesome in the bushes during their hike. Asuka promptly screams that she needs a shower to get those disgusting images out of her head.
-   _Shadows over Meridian_: When Amelia asks Ymir if Phobos has gone so far as to propose to Kage to forge their alliance, Ymir has to make an effort not to feel sick at the idea.
-   One really funny FanFiction involves Batman, Barbara Gordon, Alfred, and Robin discovering someone had posted disturbing Joker×Batman slashfic online for everyone to read. Barbara and Dick react _very badly_ to reading it.
-   In _Stronger Together_, when Buffy returns from her vision quest and hears her friends talk about how they saw Spike having sex with 'Buffy' (currently unaware that Spike was having sex with Buffy's robot double), Buffy claims that the image is so revolting that she threw up in her mouth a little, and explicitly states that even if she was split in two like Xander once was "than the other \[Buffy\] would want brain bleach as badly as \[she does\] right now".
-   This comes up in the _One Piece_ Self-Insert Fic _This Bites!_ a number of times.
    -   After witnessing Nami on a _dinner date_ with her gold, Robin desperately wishes for a way to wipe her memory.
    -   Turns out, Chopper has developed a prototype Brain Bleach. He offers to dump it in everyone's dinner after they encounter a transvestite Magical Girl.
    -   The Barto Club wish for some when their attack on a Celestial Dragon ship brings out said Celestial Dragon dressed only in his tighty-whitey briefs and one of his slaves.
    -   _Everyone_ who sees Kokoro's mermaid body wants some.
-   In the Marvel Cinematic Universe fic "Tingle", Clint requests brain bleach when Kate Bishop mentions that her current polyamorous relationship with Yelena Belova and Peter Parker includes "Lots and lots of sex".
-   The three main leads from _To Hell and Back (Arrowverse)_ have this reaction every time someone mistakes the nature of their sibling-like reaction for romance.
    
    The detective felt his hopes plummet. "So, you two aren't…"  
    "No. The thought of dating Barry – or Oliver for that matter – makes me want to lobotomize myself with a rusty spoon." Kara settled the matter instantly. Oliver sobered up at that, and he too shuddered. Kal tried to get his laughter under control, though there were still tears in his eyes.  
    "Yeah. These two are like my siblings. Never happening – _ever_." Barry added in for good measure.
    
-   _Total Drama All-Stars Rewrite_: Noah sees a painting of Chris au naturale in the winners' mansion and can't get it out of his head during episode 2. Dawn uses her abilities to help him get over it, and also steals the painting from the mansion and burns it.
-   In _Vim & Vigor_, a _Bioshock_ / _Worm_ Crossover, Greg says he needs this after using X-Ray Vision to find Squealer and Skidmark doing... stuff.
    
    **Greg:** There was sex and then there was… whatever that was. Who does that sort of thing in a drug house?
    
-   In _Vision of Escaflowne Abridged_, when Hitomi and her Wrong Guy First crush Allen Shezar discover they're a case of Surprise Incest because his father hooked up with her grandmother years ago (thanks to magical time travel), her reaction is this. His reaction?
    
    **Hitomi:** _\[internally\]_ Oh, God! Mental soap, mental soap, mental soap!  
    **Allen:** _\[internally\]_ Still legal, aaaall right!''
    

    Films — Animated 

-   _Hotel Transylvania_ has Dracula see what's the most disgusting thing to him ever: someone putting their fingers on their eyes. This happens when Johnny tries to remove his contact lenses after suggesting that they could have made him immune to Dracula's hypnosis.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   One of most famous, and oft-referenced, examples is from _Hardcore_, when Jake VanDorn (George C. Scott) sees his own daughter doing porn on the screen in front of him.
    
    **Jake:** Turn it off, TURN IT OFF, **TURN IT OFF**!
    
-   _True Stories_: Perhaps the nicest, most idealistic example of the Trope, in which the Narrator says near the end of the film that he wants to forget everything he saw - because it's so nice to experience Virgil again as if for the first time.
-   Richard Roeper wrote this in his review of _Movie 43_:
    
    _Since 1999 I've been carrying a blue pill in my pocket, holding onto it for the moment when I'd truly need it. The pill, I was told, would instantly erase the memory of any movie — but just the one movie, just the one time. I was tempted to take that pill after_ Freddy Got Fingered_. I had the pill in hand as I walked out of every other Adam Sandler movie of the last decade. But I hung on to it, knowing something even worse was going to come my way one day. Midway through_ Movie 43_, I knew the day had come. As the credits rolled with the inevitable blooper scenes of actors breaking character and inexplicably laughing when nothing funny is going on, I swallowed that pill, hoping to erase instantly all mental images of what had just transpired. It didn't work. The !&$@\*! thing didn't work!_
    
-   _Get Carter_: Jack Carter accidentally discovers that his niece — who is quite possibly his daughter — was cajoled into porn when he idly turns on a projector in the house of a local gangster's moll. As the film runs, tears well in his eyes; he takes his mind off this by embarking on an orgy of revenge.
-   _Ace Ventura: Pet Detective_:
    -   Ace reacts to the realization that Lois Einhorn, the police lieutenant who recently tongue-kissed him is actually Ray Finkle, the Miami Dolphins kicker who lost his mind following the disastrous kick that cost the Dolphins the Super Bowl by vomiting his entire stomach's contents into the toilet (using a plunger on his face), burning his clothes, and then sobbing in the shower. That scene was a Parody of _The Crying Game_. And even came with the song (as sung by Boy George) in the background. The next scene, he's in his car, chewing a whole package of Big Red gum.
    -   Oh, it gets better. When Ace strips her down to her underwear but she still appears to lack the evidence, Dan Marino calls his attention to reveal one more detail. Ace strolls back to her and turns her around, revealing that she still has her equipment..._tucked behind her ass_. Cue the SWATs doing the retching routine — as well as the dolphin! And they even put in the same music as when he had his own revelation!
-   _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_ is about what it would be like if Brain Bleach really existed. Note that Jim Carrey, responsible for the _Ace Ventura_ example above, plays it painfully straight here.
-   Taken to its Cronenbergian conclusion by Darryl Revok in _Scanners_, who drilled a hole in his forehead to let out all the voices. The scar becomes his Red Right Hand.

        **Kevin:** I remember now that hillbilly... teenage...  
        **Mike:** Oh, no!  
        **Kevin:** I don't want to tell the name, because some of you freaks out there will try to find that film. And that's just wrong! I don't remember how we got it, but we got it out of the place as fast as possible. It was about child brides, and it was...  
        **Mike:** That should give you a clue about the title.  
        **Kevin:** Stop! Psshh! Psshh!  
        **Kevin:** And it was all said in crackerville, like they actually hired people who lived there rather than actors. And I had a good cry after that one. And then a shower.  
        **Mike:** You should take a shower right after that.

        **Frasier:** I was about to make one of those myself.

        **Roz:** No, she got a million-dollar TV deal.  
        **Frasier:** _\[chokes on his sherry, then mock-calmly mutters\]_ Well, good news for Gertie and for the many atheists who will welcome this new proof of their theory!
        
    -   "The Wizard and Roz":

        **Niles:** _\[flustered\]_ Great.

    -   The episode "Momma Mia" when Frasier finally realises that his girlfriend is identical to his late mother, and Niles thinks that he's suffering from an Oedipus complex.
        
        **Niles:** _\[running for his bug spray\]_ Frasier, you didn't do anything wrong, your feelings for Mia stem from perfectly natural Oedipal desires.  
        **Frasier:** Yes, but Oedipal desires are supposed to resolve themselves by the age of six!  
        _\[Niles starts with the bug spray\]_  
        **Frasier:** Oh for God's sake, give me that, you idiot!  
        _\[Frasier takes the spray and "blinds" himself with it accidentally\]_  
        **Frasier:** _\[screams\]_ I've blinded myself!

    **Hermione:** Hagrid, it's Hermione.  
    **Hagrid:** _\[eyes widen\]_ Yikes. What happened? Take it out of my brain, take it out! Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot! Okay, well, all right, I'd better go out to the woods and tame my dragon.

    **Max:** Our dad kisses your poster!

        **Mary:** Ugh! I need a bleach transfusion.
        
-   GOB from _Arrested Development_ carries a stash of pills that he calls "forget-me-nows". (They're actually illegal roofies.)

Fortunately for him, a Tap on the Head works just as well.
-   _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_: In "Not With My Pig, You Don't", while Phil's mother tells the family stories about her "Zeke's" rural boyhood.

    **Oprah:** What's happening?

    _"Sorry, I was just thinking about Henry and the warthog."_
    

    Music 

-   "Weird Al" Yankovic: "My Own Eyes" is a List Song of all the bizarre and horrifying sights that the singer wishes that he could unsee, such as a pair of drag queens stuffing crackers up each other's noses, a fat man who sold his own skeleton to a pawn shop, a mime being murdered with an imaginary cleaver, and a child's lemonade stand that also sells weapons-grade plutonium (although he admits that their lemonade was actually really good).

    Myths & Religion 

-   In the Greek tragedy _Oedipus the King_, when Oedipus learned that he had murdered the King on the road before marrying the Queen, oh, and also that they're _his mom and dad_, which means his kids are the product of incest, he literally gouged out his own eyes in horror on finding her dead by her own hand (using the pin used to secure his cloak, no less), and then went Walking the Earth to atone for what he had done, making this Older Than Feudalism.
-   Hermes would've wanted some after catching Hades and Persephone in the act in the Homeric Hymn To Demeter.

    Podcasts 

-   The _MST3K_ tradition continues on in _RiffTrax_.
    -   For example, in the RiffTrax of _Attack of the Clones_, Kevin tells Mike during the Greasy Spoon scene regarding slovenly cook Dexter, "Mike, I invite you to think about his underpants." Mike understandably reacts in horror: "_Why_, Kevin?!" Kevin subverts the trope by telling him that so long as he's thinking about Dexter's underpants, he's forgetting the rest of the movie. Mike's response. "(_sigh of relief_) You're right. Ah, his underpants..."
    -   From watching Ross Hagen having "brain sex" (It Makes Sense in Context) in _Wonder Women_:
        
        **Kevin:** You know, when I got here today, I didn't expect to see **THE MOST VOMIT-INDUCING THING EVER COMMITTED TO FILM!!!**
        
    -   While watching _Star Trek: Generations_, when they first see the Duras sisters and their Cleavage Window, Kevin muses if they're seeing the only hairless portions of their breasts, prompting Mike to scream in bloody horror.

    Video Games 

-   In _Batman: Arkham Asylum_, The Joker attempts to invoke this trope while Batman is under the effects of Scarecrow's fear gas.
    
    **Joker:** Tell me, Bats, what are you _really_ scared of? Failing to save this cesspool of a city? Not finding the Commissioner in time? _Me?_ In a _THONG?!_ _\[maniacal laughter\]_
    
-   _Sam & Max: Freelance Police_:
    -   Early in _Culture Shock_, Jimmy Two-Teeth the rat steals the duo's phone. When they catch him and make him return it, he coughs it up... literally. Sam's reaction is a stunned "Oh, for the love 'a — I wish I could unsee that!"
    -   Happens again in _Beyond The Alley Of The Dolls._ Flint Paper leaves to go "kill a few neurons" after seeing Girl Stinky kiss Sam.

-   _Dragon Age II_:
    -   At one point Hawke can comment on some dirty image Isabela apparently saw in the Amell family crest, and when s/he finds it s/he says "Sweet Maker! I can't unsee that!"
    -   Another, and possibly funnier, exchange occurs when you accept a male hooker's invitation with Bethany in the party, but decline when she protests
        
        **Bethany:** Maker's breath! Can't you... do this when I'm not around?  
        **Hawke:** Fine. I'll come back later.  
        **Bethany:** It's too late. The images are already in my mind and they are never, ever going away.
        
    -   Also the various reactions of most party members when Isabela makes vague suggestions for Aveline's new marriage. And then spells it out for everyone who still had doubts. Fenris actually chuckles.
-   In _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, Commander Cullen clearly needs some after he gets an eyeful of naked Iron Bull during Bull's romance arc.
    
    **Cassandra:** Do you see this?!  
    **Cullen:** No.  
    _\[later\]_  
    **Inquisitor:** I believe we may have blinded poor Cullen.
    
-   _Tales of Monkey Island, Episode 1_: Guybrush Threepwood goes to open a cabinet, which the Voodoo Lady yells for him not to open. He asks her what's in it, and she replies, "My unmentionables." Guybrush shudders, and the cabinet from then on is named "The Scariest Cabinet In the World."
-   _Planescape: Torment_ accentuates not only the use of Brain Bleach but also the importance of keeping a note of having done so. A story is told in-game about an old man sitting at the side of the road with no memory of who he is or where he was going. An old hag then appears before him, and asks him what his third wish will be. The confused man wonders how he can have a third wish without making a first or second wish, and she tells him that he used his second wish to undo his first wish, which is why he doesn't remember making them. The old man wishes to know who he is, and the hag grants it, remarking, "Funny. That was your _first_ wish."
-   In _The Reconstruction_, there is this exchange:
    
    **Kott:** "The sky boils, the sea burns, the soil begs forgiveness." You ever heard anything like that?  
    **Qualstio:** No, but, it's pretty creepy. I wish I could un-hear it.
    
-   On one episode of _Help Me! Professor Kokonoe!_, Makoto runs right on in with a tone in her voice and a facial expression that suggests she needs the biggest glass of the stuff the titular professor can offer. Considering that the bad ending required to get here is Demon Path lite, can you really blame her?
-   In the _Sword of the Stars_ universe, there is a subcaste of Prester Zuul known as the Sin-Eaters who specialize in providing this service, by taking such memories into their mind away from those who suffer from it. They see holding these memories as part of their penance.
-   The diary entry on the first appearance of Panoptes in _Azada 4: Elementa_ referred to it as "an image I can't remove from my brain with bleach and a scrub brush."
-   In _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_, Jerry the Bob-omb could use five swimming pools worth of brain bleach after seeing Luigi in a wedding dress. In fact, his reason for joining Luigi on his adventure is to prevent other people from having the same experience.
    
    **Jerry:** It is now my goal in life to keep this guy from ever dressing as a woman again.
    
-   In _Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island_, the Boss Battle with Prince Froggy involves yellow Yoshi getting shrunk down and swallowed by Froggy. After the fight inside the frog's stomach, Yoshi is expelled out Froggy's behind. He reverts back to normal, with a disturbed look on his face.
-   In _Mass Effect: Andromeda_, a female Ryder can engage in some hilariously awkward flirting with the scientist on the bridge of the Tempest. At the end of the conversation, the ship's pilot, who's been sitting right next to them the whole time and obviously wishing he weren't, will look down at his console and say "Kill. Me. Now."
-   _Team Fortress 2_: The Spy apparently finds performing a Square Dance (a taunt that needs two, and every other character is quite enthusiastic to join in) so mortifying he often promises to stab the memory out of his skull when he's done, when he's not threatening others to remain quiet about it on pain of death.
-   _World of Horror_ has the Memory Extract spell, which allows the caster to restore a bit of their Reason at the cost of a bit of Experience. This is because you're purging traumatic memories, losing whatever they taught you in the process.
-   In _Yakuza Kiwami 2_, Kiryu is invited by Patriarch Gondawara in a substory called "Be My Baby" to his favorite club... which essentially sees a bunch of grown-ass men in diapers roleplaying as babies. The look on Kiryu's face when he finds Gondawara with his men pretty much _screams_ this trope.
    -   The Gondawara family also returns in _Yakuza: Like a Dragon_... Ichiban's reaction is every bit as disgusted and weirded out as Kiryu's. This coming from someone who, among other things, has had to catch a public urinator, fight a chimp operating heavy machinery, fight a tiger just like Kiryu did in the above game (in the main story, no less), and saved and outright befriended a crayfish.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_ has Jean Armstrong rubbing lotion on himself. It elicits a call for brain bleach by Phoenix.
    -   Prior to that:
        
        **Phoenix:** So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such a uniform! _Even me!_  
        **Judge:** Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image.
        
    -   And in case 5, we have this gem:
        
        **Phoenix:** It's so inappropriate. Like Sister Bikini<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in a bikini! _\[shudder\]_ ...I've gotta think of the kittens...
        
    -   In _Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney_, after learning that there's a panty thief going around Apollo has a mental image of Plum Kitaki's bloomers. Understandably, he's not happy about it.
    -   Not as egregious as the above, but still to some extent: Sal Manella describing how he "wolfed down a T-bone steak", complete with his most disturbing animation<small>◊</small> prompts Phoenix some clearly unpleasant thoughts.
        
        **Phoenix:** (A mental image I will carry with me to my grave...)
        
    -   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Dual Destinies_, Edgeworth proposes that an 11-year-old Athena killed her mother, then had her body moved to the robotic operating table where it would be disassembled to hide the evidence. Phoenix really, _really_ doesn't want this image in his mind.
    -   Also from _Dual Destinies_ is Phoenix's reaction to Norma DePlume's breakdown, which blows all the buttons off her coat and cuts away _just_ as it's about to open. He even breaks out the rare Despair animation usually reserved for bad endings and Darkest Hours.
-   In _Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors,_ repeatedly examining a useless bed in one room will cause one of your companions in that room (Snake) to remark on your reasons for becoming obsessed with the bed: "Is it because you're hoping to spend some time in it... with me?"

    **Oxhorn:** It's _horrible!_  
    **Staghorn:** Oh God, _why?_

-   _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device:_
    -   The Emperor dislikes the Dreadknight's design so much he says "If I still had eyes, I would require someone to deposit prometheum-infused floor cleaner into them."
    -   An ill-thought remark the Emperor makes about Rogal Dorn saying "fuck that" to the Codex Astartes gets him more information than he wanted. Rogal is apparently literally brain-damaged, explaining how he can be _that_ Literal-Minded.
        
        **Rogal:** I did not wish to copulate with his book, father. I have only seen Lorgar do such a thing.  
        _\[Glass shattering\]_  
        **Emperor:** Please erase these mind images immediately
        
    -   It happens again later in a podcast, with Rogal once more and with the same Primarch being the topic, after the Emperor's made several complaints about the equipment's painful approach to censorship:
        
        **Emperor:** Go \*HONK\* yourself Rogal  
        **Rogal:** I believe that is biologically impossible, father. And I have only seen Lorgar do that with extensive genetic modifications.  
        **Emperor:** Is there an option to censor everything Rogal says ever?
        
    -   And yet again when The Emperor witnesses Santodes seduce the Skitarii on Mars.
        
        **Emperor:** Drill into my skull and remove my cognizance please.

    -   There is another instance in which Strong Bad is forced to share a fallout shelter with Bubs and Coach Z.
        
        **Strong Bad:** Bubs, where's the bathroom in this place? It's just a bunch of canned goods.  
        **Bubs:** Well, you know what they say, Strong Bad. Today's Pork and Beans is tomorrow's toilet.  
        **Coach Z:** And in some rare cases, today's.  
        **Strong Bad:** Ugh! Bubs, I thought you said this fallout shelter was Coach Z-free.  
        **Bubs:** Well, somebody's gotta carry on the human race.  
        **Strong Bad:** Aaagh! I don't want to think about words anymore!

    -   In a later episode, where Venom and Bane square off, whilst Wiz and Boomstick explain the symbiote, Wiz reveals that his clothes are actually symbiotes. Since sonic noises are one of the symbiote's weaknesses, Boomstick decides to test it out. By yelling loudly. Which he immediately regrets.
-   _The Most Popular Girls in School_: In Episode 53, this is Trisha 2's reaction upon seeing a baby's head sticking out of Saison's vagina.

    Webcomics 

-   _8-Bit Theater_:
    -   When the Light Warriors learn of Bahamut and Matoya's relationship. And that the quest item they had just fetched for Bahamut was actually the last ingredient for a virility drug.
        
        **Black Mage:** I'm going to throw up now. On the off chance that there's a kind and loving God, I will choke on my own vomit. Do **not** help. _\[after vomiting for several panels\]_ Oh God, I'm ejecting things I haven't eaten yet.  
        _\[a few pages later\]_  
        **Black Mage:** Right now, I'd be happy with the power to stab out my mind's eye.  
        **Red Mage:** Can we get a full round of that?
        
    -   In a later scene, Thief is unimpressed with a so-called dark, mysterious woods the party has entered, and makes an aside remark about having seen "darker wood in Elf porn." It's enough to make Black Mage projectile-vomit in the background. His analogy certainly didn't help matters... or the readers' sanity...
        
        **Black Mage:** Man, and I didn't lose it when I caught sight of an elder god defecating.  
        **Fighter:** _\[looking down\]_ You got some of it on my shoes.  
        **Black Mage:** It shat out _advertising executives_. They're the bowel obstruction that killed the old universe.
        
    -   When Red Mage proposes animal husbandry as a solution:
        
        **Red Mage:** Yeah. Two words for you. Animal. Husbandry.  
        **Fighter:** I don't know what he means.  
        **Thief:** _God_, I envy you.
        
-   _Bruno the Bandit_:
-   _Captain SNES: The Game Masta_
    -   Used in a rhyming non-canon Wonderful Life\-ish storyline (the angel was drunk, so she took him to the wrong "what if" universe) when Alex realizes that the chick he's been checking out is his own opposite-gendered parallel universe equivalent.
        
        **Alexis:** _\[to her friends\]_ I left them there on the street as black stains.  
        **Alex:** _\[to the drunk angel\]_ I'd like to go home to buy bleach for my brain.
        
    -   In canon, Alex's captor _screams_ for this after getting an extreme close-up, via flashback visual, of King Hippo's "bitch tits."
    -   And then, of course, the crowning example found here, combined with a liberal dose of self-inflicted Explain, Explain... Oh, Crap! as Alex draws some conclusions about King Hippo's relationship with his ex-wife.
-   In _The Cartoon Chronicles Of Conroy Cat_, Conroy sees doggy "naked" and says that he'll "take up that sale on brain bleach."
-   _El Goonish Shive_
    -   Tedd asks Grace if her antennae can function as Brain Bleach in this strip.
    -   Justin could probably use some Brain Bleach here.
    -   Sarah wants to file an order now too.
        
        **Susan:** You once told me you felt less attracted to Elliot after he started having to transform. What if the actual reason you felt that way was that it made him feel more like a _sister_ to you?  
        **Sarah:** _\[beat panel\] Nope._ Not considering it.  
        **Susan:** It could explain a few—  
        **Sarah:** **Nope.**
        
-   In _Exiern_, after accidentally picturing her father being involved in Yaoi Porn, Princess Peonie has this reaction:
    
    **Princess Peonie:** It's only by sheer will that I'm not jamming a spoon up my nostril to scoop out the mental image in my head.
    
-   _FreakAngels_
    -   This is one among the many FreakAngels powers. They apply it as a mercy to traumatized people they encounter, but also often without consent, in order to keep their powers secret. They do have self-imposed laws concerning the morals of this practice, but treat those more like "Guidelines"
    -   The FreakAngels are OFTEN treated to Too Much (sex-related) Information from their friends, invoking this trope. Most clear example is poor Connor's reaction to reaching his Too Much Information limit for one day. This scene came very soon after a very similar reveal concerning his MOTHER. "No No NO That is not an interesting fact and I dont want it in my head".
-   _Freefall_
    -   When a security guard saw Helix's topiary rendition of Sam as a reclining nude, he had to be physically restrained: "_My eyes! I have to **pull out my eyes!** If I don't I might see it again! I have to pull out my eyes!_"
    -   Robots commit data from short term memory to long term memory about every 24 hours in a procedure similar to sleep. Thus "staying awake" for extra 24 hours after a particularly nasty day will overwrite that day's memories and experiences, serving as general-purpose Brain Bleach.
    -   Organic AIs were created with several safeguards, control and shutdown mechanisms hard-coded into their DNA. One of those works with a chemical that disables short to long term memory data transfer; another allows to wipe recent direct orders from the AI's memory.
    -   Bowman AI architecture works via neural pathways. Pruning those pathways indiscriminately wipes information associated with them, be it memory, skill or attitude. The "Gardener in the Dark" neural pruning software, which blindly cuts all pathways above certain length, reduces self-aware A.I.s to sub-sentient robots, leaving only their primary purposes intact.
-   _Full Frontal Nerdity_ gave us a number of unpleasant mental images, including mind flayers and lizardmen reproducing. Considering that mind flayers are betentacled Eldritch Abominations, the screams of "THIS IS WORSE THAN HENTAI!" and "MUST DUMP CLOROX IN EARS!" seem entirely justified. It should be noted that Frank was intentionally trying to Squick the other characters in that panel.
    -   The actual D&D lore for how those two reproduce? Mind flayers stick their tadpoles into the heads of other creatures, Wrath of Khan-style, and the tadpoles eat the brains of their new hosts and mutate into a mind flayer or flayer-esque creature. Not the same kind of horrible as Frank's friends are thinking, but still pretty gross.
-   _Girl Genius_:
    
    -   Being a comic about Mad Scientists this shows up in _Girl Genius_ as something Mittelmind kindly provides to his loyal minion for her birthday.
    
    **Mittelmind:** Oh, there is some psychological damage, but I always wipe her memory for her birthday.  
    **Snaug:** Happy birthday to meeeeeee...
    
    -   Earlier the Baron had mild version of this type of reaction after hearing Bang talk about his son's crush:
        
        **DuPree:** He's all set to be a hero and _rescue_ her and then he finds out he'd need fireplace tongs to get her undressed? Yeah-upset is the word.  
        **Klaus:** Thank you DuPree, for that... vivid imagery.
        
-   _Girls Next Door_
    -   One of Christine's responses to Jadis the White Witch and Darkness hooking up in this comic strip.
    -   And this when picturing Erik as a basement dwelling otaku
    -   And Erik here because of the new hobby of his roommate.
        
        **Erik:** Cannot unsee!!
        
    -   From the same verse just from the _Roommates_ side an omake page. He saw Javert and Valjean kissing.
        
        **Erik:** ...can't unsee... _\[whimper\]_
        
    -   Also Jareth and Loki here. They played _The Sandman (1989)_\-style Battle of Wits game ... seems like Nyan cat beats The Mighty Thor.
        
        **Jareth:** Look, it was your idea to play The Game, so it's hardly my fault we need Brain Bleach!
        
-   In the female dominant webcomic _Girly_, the most important male character, Officer Policeguy, has a clear sign of brain bleach. He begins the comic with long hair and bishounen looks. During the beginning of the comic, he almost has sex with El Chupacabre, a man with the ability to attract any woman or man that looks somewhat like a woman, even if they are straight. He is traumatized, cuts his hair shorter, and blocks out the event completely from his mind when questioned about it later. However, when El Chupacabre accidentally falls on him later on, the horrible memory comes rushing back and starts cursing dramatically at him.
-   _Grrl Power_: After a bad guy gets reduced to Ludicrous Gibs by Cora's ordnance, some of them splashing all over Halo, Sydney reaches out for the syringe containing a memory-erasing drug said bad guy planned to use on her — despite having fully heard the theory it could react badly with her ADHD and turn her into a vegetable. Good thing she can't reach it.
-   _Gunnerkrigg Court_
    -   Kat tries to be polite upon meeting Ketrak, the psychopomp of insects, but as soon as he's gone...
        
        **Kat:** Ugh! I need new eyes and a new brain!
        
    -   Annie was shocked merely by observing two kissing Merostomatozons ("very distantly related to eurypterids and xiphosura").
-   From _Hark! A Vagrant_, when someone suggests to her to check out James Joyce's love letters to his wife. Leads to this exchange:
    
    **Dream James Joyce:** I wrote you a letter.  
    **Kate:** Get away from me, James Joyce!
    
-   _Head Trip_ by Shinga. "I can feel it... **watching**" Just exorcise it.
-   In _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!,_ Bob has twice thought, "Never gonna be able to un-see that!" The first time was on seeing giant goon Rocko Sasquatch in nothing but his underwear. The second was when he stumbled across a married pair of three-eyed lobster aliens sharing an intimate moment in a closet.
-   _Kevin & Kell_'s Rudy Dewclaw had a little trouble with the concept of his parents and mixed-sex flea dips, in addition to anime convention costumes.
-   In _Knights of Buena Vista_, Mary mentioned that she liked to wear furs over swimsuits in summer, and her boyfriend Bill insisted that was a private thing with them. His sister Adriana realized that Mary then let her borrow those very furs after Mary wore them that way. Adriana thought she was going to be sick, and Mary insisted that nothing happened; Bill just took pictures.
    
    **Adriana:** That's NOT helping, Mary!"
    
-   _The Last Days of Foxhound_:
    -   A lot of talk occurs about about shutting down the parts of the brain that let you visualise things at one point.
    -   During a dive into Ocelot's mind, Mantis assumes that the giant door labelled PORN must be anything other than porn, because it's _Ocelot_. He learns, the hard way, that he is wrong.
        
        **Mantis:** I would kill him later but I need to kill myself _now_.
        
-   _Last Res0rt_ lampshades it in the middle of Jigsaw's panic attack after she picks up some apparent thoughts from Jason Spades and Alice Quinn enjoying their newfound 'alliance'.
    
    **Cypress:** Doing any better down there?  
    **Jigsaw:** _\[weakly\]_ My brain wants bleach please...
    
-   _Life and Death_: Steve is seen by his sister in Valkyrie armor. Her reaction is quite predictable.
-   A _Life With Lamarr_ strip had this reaction to something:
    
    **Citizen:** Thank the Lord I brought my _**lucky pliers**_ today! Nothing for it but to pull out my own eyeballs and _**stamp**_ on them... Only way to be sure I never see that again.  
    **Citizen #2:** Hey, after you with those pliers?
    
-   In _Nip and Tuck_, after being shown a picture of previous Pop's Girls, Nip asks about the fox cutie, stating that she was hot. Pop responds that that is Nip's mom. He then asks his brother to take a toilet brush and run it through his brain a few times.
-   _Bug_ shows why you need some at the nudist camp.
    
    "Hm... maybe I can destroy this memory by drinking turpentine."
    
-   In one _Oglaf_ comic, a man and woman having sex releases a tapeworm goddess from out of the woman's mouth. The tapeworm says she'll grant them each wish for freeing her, and both the man and woman wish they had never seen that.
-   _The Order of the Stick_
    -   Roy's reaction to hearing what Belkar wanted to do to his gender-flipped self:
        
        **Roy:** Excuse me, I need to soak my brain in acid now... Maybe my ears, too.
        
    -   Note that this was fully intentional on Belkar's part. He could tell that it was Roy by the scent, and is apparently secure in his masculinity — not to mention extremely sadistic.
    -   On a related note, Belkar himself has a tendency to go blind, or at least wish aloud that he'd done so, when he sees other male characters naked. See for example, #25
        
        **Elan:** Woohoo! I'm invisible!  
        **Roy:** How I wish that was true.  
        **Belkar:** _\[to Durkon\]_ Please cast Blindness on me.
        
    -   Roy and Belkar thinking that Haley was talking about Elan's penis when she's really talking about the new rapier she found for him.
        
        **Haley:** Vaarsuvius checked it out too, naturally \[...\] I mean, it's awfully skinny, but he uses it so masterfully.
        
    -   This is then subverted when Haley says:
        
        **Haley:** Well anyway, V says Elan has been running around naked, so I'm off to see what his 18 Charisma is worth "under the hood".
        
    -   Roy needed some Brain Bleach after he died and saw his mother in the afterlife, and realized that her spirit manifests there as a hot chick several years younger than he. He needed _more_ Brain Bleach when he saw that she was sleeping around.
    -   The Oracle of the Sunken Valley needed Brain Bleach after (apparently) having witnessed, in a vision, Roy and Celia having sex. He's a kobold, so he finds mammals mating disgusting.
    -   #753 has Belkar attacking Roy mentally once again, covering up Roy's recognition of Tarquin's appearance via claiming Roy is gay and thinks Tarquin is totally hot. He's definitely getting a lot out of that feat in Craft Disturbing Mental Image.
-   On the boat in _Our Little Adventure_, Angelika accidentally walks in on Julie and Lenny having sex. To make matters worse, Julie actually asks Angelika to take a look at Lenny's boner and compare it to Rocky's. Angelika is not amused by this, but ends up taking it out on Pauline when she also asks if it's bigger than Rocky's.
-   _Penny Arcade_:
-   _Questionable Content_
-   _Rusty and Co._ used "lots and lots of beer" after an instance of Boy Meets Ghoul:
    
    **Mimic:** Goal: Achieved! Also... Brain: Scarred!
    
-   Sweden learns something new about his sister in an episode of _Scandinavia and the World_.
-   _Schlock Mercenary_:
    -   Ennesby's "Weapons-Grade Vocabulary" and the memorable response:
        
        **Jevee Ceeta:** My stomach is in my throat now. It's trying to spit acid on the parts of my brain that remember reading his message.
        
    -   The incident with cloning of General Hugo Matsui Xinchub in an effort to be paid five times for one job. Clones are grown in slime-filled People Jars and do not have clothing. While this may be enough to elicit minor comments of disgust when main characters are being partially cloned as an extreme medical measure — Xinchub is utterly _despised_ by everyone in the cast and morbidly obese, to boot, and then, there was that tattoo...
        
        **Kevyn:** If I get drunk _right now_ I might be able to shut down my long-term memory before the next write transaction.
        
    -   That page also mentions a more literal version in "minute after" pills (mercenary work obviously can involve quite unpleasant imagery), but as the next page shows, these don't always work well enough.
        
        **Ch'vorthq:** You should ask the Doc for a "minute after" pill.  
        **Kevyn:** I just popped three. There was a tattoo.
        
    -   Der Trihs, staring into his (iced) drink after learning adult kreelies had been mating in the freezer (via external fertilization):
        
        **Der Trihs:** I need a tall glass of bleach _right now_.
        
    -   And again, when Tagon attempts to take both their minds off alluring but improper thoughts and overdoes it:
        
        **Kevyn:** That's overkill. I'm shooting for "Don't think about Elf." and you're taking us all the way to "I need to gouge out my eyes."
        
    -   While they are at brain-fixing, 'Chelle wants to wipe the memories of her clarinet lessons.
-   _Sexy Losers_
    -   Mark's plaintive cry (brought on by the antics of his roommate and his roommate's sister) of "I don't want my eyes anymore!"
    -   In one guest comic, he goes for a more "realistic" solution when his roommate uses him as masturbation fodder — incredible amounts of cocaine.

**Nick:** Note to self... install bleach dispenser in brain tank...

-   _Sluggy Freelance_
    -   In "Love Potion":
        
        **Riff:** Good God, man! If you're going to sit in the wine-glass-shaped jacuzzi, wear swim trunks! Holy pressed ham, I need to wash my eyeballs!
        
    -   When Torg announces "I just got a magic flap installed!" and some other characters are heard making comments like "It's a little snug for me, but I did play with it a bit!" Later, at the bar:
        
        **Riff:** Whisky double straight up.  
        **Bun-bun:** Alfalfa margarita, hold the alfalfa.  
        _\[gulp!\]_  
        **Riff:** It's that he came back from the _doctor's_ with that announcement that freaks—  
        **Bun-bun:** _Never speak of it again_.
        
    -   Riff's reaction to Bert possessed by a ghostly women who is married to the ghost possessing Torg counts as this.
    -   And now we have Lau in response to Dr. Nofun explaining how even dating is better without women.
    -   In "Safehouse", Riff is looking a way to undo the effects of a hypnotic pattern spread via the Internet, and in the process runs across some zombie pornography on its creator's computer. When he does manage to send out hypnotic patterns to undo the previous ones, he also includes the command "unsee the zombie porn".
    -   In "A Year in the Life of a Villain", Dr. Schlock remarks that "Sometimes, you've got to get out and live," and, after seeing a frog wearing a thong, adds, "And other times, you've got to hide, scrub your one good eye and try to get the images unburned from your brain."
-   _Something\*Positive_:
    
    **Jhim:** Must fight visual. Must. Fight. Visual... **_Urk!!_** _Visual is winning! Visual is winning!_
    
    -   Lisa's dad in this strip.
-   _Spacetrawler_: Yuri seems to give Dimitri reason to ask for some. Or at least some... uncomfortable cleaning implements. It's worth noting that disgusted/horrified as he _is_, he's still willing to try it out.
-   Characters in _Umlaut House_ do it from time to time. Given that most of them have quite a few implants in their brains, this is apparently a pretty trivial thing for them to do.
-   _VG Cats_:
    -   When Aeris saw the "Democrat Dance Revolution game intro. (It involves Q1Al Gore.)
        
        **Aeris:** SWEET HOLY HELL! SOMEONE GOUGE OUT MY EYES!
        
    -   Also, the infamous Fox/Falco comic. For the readers. Unless you're into that.
-   Creepknight from _Voodoo Walrus_ seemed to hold it together well through everything. Until finding out how his boss powered his underwater "Doomcano" publishing house.
-   _Wally and Osborne_ "WILL NO AMOUNT OF SALTWATER EVER CLEANSE THESE EYES?!"
-   _Wapsi Square_:
-   This _The Way of the Metagamer_ comic references the concept, although thankfully the actual event is merely Noodle Implements.
-   _Who Says Space Quest is Dead_: Xandra mentions she's seen a Crack Pairing Slash Fic between Vohaul (of _Space Quest_) and Manannan (of _King's Quest_). Roger goes off to get himself killed so that he can remove the image from his head. (Scary thing is, this is based on a _real_ slashfic with that pairing that actually exists. It's _just_ as mind-scarring as it sounds.)
-   _Wooden Plank Studios_: those assigned to get something to revive Corrin in _Fire Emblem Fates_, when hearing his sister Camilla is also his wife (granted, she leaves out he's adopted), are downright horrified.

    Web Original 

-   _Chakona Space_ features Stew discussing having a group of gay characters sire her future children. Her captain, knowing they're not interested in females mentions them chasing after her with a turkey baster.
    
    **Stew:** Thanks. Now I can't get that image out of my head.
    
-   _Protectors of the Plot Continuum_ features Bleeprin (bleach combined with Aspirin), its variants, and Suebuprofen; they are used to help agents cope with anything disturbing they witness while on missions.
-   Jericho's clothing in the _Whateley Universe_. Jericho is a (sort of) blind deviser who deliberately wears clothing so horrible that people — mutant superpowered people — flee in terror. He hangs with a guy who looks like a humanoid velociraptor, a girl who looks like a naga, monster-girl twins who cast a fear aura, and it's his clothing choices that upset nearby people. He actually manages to cause a guy to vomit just through color choices alone.
-   Any Shock Site inspires videos or photographs of reaction videos, mostly of people asking for this.

-   _SCP Foundation_
    -   The use of "Class A amnestics" is routine for the Foundation, reserved primarily for those who have learned of the Foundation and/or what they deal with on a regular basis. All to maintain the illusion of a safe and sane universe.
    -   Personnel working with SCP-231-7 are _mandated_ to have regular memory wipes of the truly horrendous things they have to do, to ensure that the Fetus Terrible she carries remains unborn, lest they face the End of Days. Before it became policy, suicide among the personnel was _very_ high.
    -   Personnel will regularly request amnesiacs after particularly unsettling events, such as witnessing the particularly brutal death of a colleague or watching _End of Evangelion_. Most requests are denied.
    -   Most if not all of these amnestics come from SCP-3000. And the way it produces said amnestics certainly _requires_ amnestics.
-   _Texts from Superheroes_: Supergirl searches the city for a bomb with her X-Ray Vision and declares that she needs to "fly through the sun and clean my eyeballs" after seeing some of the things people do behind closed doors.
