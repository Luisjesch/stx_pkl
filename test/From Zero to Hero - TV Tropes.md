"_He was a no-one! (A zero, zero!)  
Now, he's a honcho! (He's a hero!)  
Here was a kid with his act down pat!  
From zero to hero  
In no time flat!  
Zero to hero!  
Just like that!_"

It's a trope that's as old as storytelling itself, and most likely exist until the very last story is told: a character starts out from humble origins to become a hero. It's not difficult to see why this is such an enduring storytelling pattern: it's at once an underdog story, a story of personal growth, and a variation of what may be _the_ archetypal storytelling formula. It also allows us to see a bit of ourselves in our so-called "zero" and imagine that we, too, could aspire to greatness should we ever have the opportunity. Stories such as these not only entertain us; they also give us hope.

The _From Zero to Hero_ trope is a variation on The Hero's Journey: it describes stories in which a person of humble beginnings answers the Call to Adventure, grows as a person and as an agent of change, succeeds at their journey, and comes back the victorious hero. In some cases, they may even become the Big Good of the story.

There are three essential components of this trope, although each allows for large amounts of variation:

**The Humble Beginnings**: The "humble beginning" is a defining part of this trope; you can hardly have a "zero to hero" plot without a "zero." For the purposes of this trope, "zero" describes a character who begins the story with a very low station in life. They may have been born into abject poverty, or they may belong to a maligned racial, religious, or social demographic. They may begin with no real allies or social connections, or they may simply be a loser in the game of life. Whatever the case may be, the "zero" begins the story lacking the resources or the abilities needed to achieve their ultimate goal. It's through the journey that these resources and abilities are gained.

**The Journey and the Heroic Act**: For this story pattern to take place, the character must also have a _journey_ to complete, and an ultimate goal to achieve. They must be given obstacles to overcome, new skills to learn, and opportunities to grow as a person. The journey doesn't necessarily have to be a _physical_ one involving miles of travel, it's merely a term that describes the zero's progression towards hero.

In the end, the hero must achieve their ultimate goal, which generally culminates in the "heroic act" — the action or series of actions that brings about the hero's victory. While the ways in which this plays out can vary wildly, the "heroic act" does have to be of sufficient _difficulty_ and sufficient _importance_ to elevate the hero's value in the eyes of others. They must stop seeing him as a "zero" and start regarding him as a "hero".

**The Rising Hero**: As the name "From Zero to Hero" implies, the zero cannot remain a zero at the end of the story. Their reward doesn't have to involve massive wealth — this isn't a Rags to Riches story — nor do they necessarily have to have a "Happily Ever After" kind of ending. They do, however, have to end the story in a better state than the one they began with. While there are all manner of ways to subvert or otherwise play with this story pattern, for the example to be played completely straight, the hero's standing in life must be in some way improved as a direct result of their journey.

While the terminology used in this description may suggest that this trope is exclusive to epic fantasy quests, that's really not the case. _From Zero to Hero_ can encompass all kinds of stories: for example, it can also apply to an impoverished child's journey to become a champion athlete, or an untested young scientist's years-long quest to find a cure for an awful disease. It describes a story's _structure_ or _pattern_; its subject matter is limited only to the author's imagination.

_Extremely_ common in Trapped in Another World stories. May involve The Prophecy, Divine Intervention, The Chosen One, or becoming Legendary in the Sequel. May enlist the Farm Boy, The Chosen Zero, or the Ordinary High-School Student as the protagonist. May overlap with Humble Hero if the character still remembers their origins. Often involves Took a Level in Badass, and/or becoming a Self-Made Man. See also Giving the Sword to a Noob, Let's Get Dangerous!, Messianic Archetype, and To Be a Master.

Compare Jackie Robinson Story, a related trope specific to racial minorities, as well as You Go, Girl! and "Gender-Normative Parent" Plot for gender-specific versions. Compare and contrast Rags to Riches, where a character rises from their initial position by making a lot of money. Contrast From Nobody to Nightmare, this trope's villainous equivalent; Experienced Protagonist, who completely averts the "zero" portion of this trope; and Born Winner, who may be the Privileged Rival to our "zero".

Not to be confused with My Hero, Zero, which is about characters who are _literally_ named "Zero" or variations of it.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Asta from _Black Clover_ is seemingly the only person in the setting who cannot use magic. Despite this, thanks to his handicap he manifests his own grimoire that lets him wield Anti-Magic swords, allowing him to fight other mages and join a Magic Knight Squad. Through the Black Bulls, he defeats enemies of the Clover Kingdom and hopes to one day become the Wizard King, the strongest Magic Knight in the kingdom.
-   Aichi Sendou from _Cardfight!! Vanguard_ starts the story as an Extreme Doormat with no friends who is frequently bullied by his peers — to the point that he had to change schools. Over the course of the series, he grows into a confident young man with great leadership skills, many close friends, and is hailed as Asia's Vanguard Champion.
-   _Dragon Ball_ tells the story of how Goku, a carefree young boy living in the wilderness, ends up getting pulled into many adventures of stopping villains from taking over or destroying the world, which eventually leads him to become the most powerful hero in the universe.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   The series is ripe with these characters. Aside from all of the protagonists of the fifth and sixth parts going from petty criminals and thugs to heroes that take down Physical Gods, the series has Robert EO Speedwagon; a guy who starts out as a street thug, but after meeting Jonathan he exploits his Rags to Riches status to support and aid the Joestar line for over a hundred years.
    -   Initially being a little, kinda wimpy guy, Koichi Hirose from _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable_ shows that after gaining his Stand he actually has some backbone, and keeps getting more moments of badassery.
-   Akko from _Little Witch Academia (2017)_ dreams of becoming a magnificent witch who spreads happiness, but she lacks the magical prowess. She frequently goofs and looks even more incapable next to her highly skilled rival Diana. However, she goes through lots of training and manages to spread happiness with sheer positivity, even learning to master the legendary Shiny Rod which comes in handy when saving the world.
-   Nanoha from _Lyrical Nanoha_ starts off as the youngest daughter to a family of bakers growing up on an Insignificant Little Blue Planet. The revelation that she had great potential in magic (along with several years of Training from Hell) eventually resulted in her becoming a celebrated hero throughout the multiverse, with In-Universe movies having been made about her exploits.
-   In _My Hero Academia_, Izuku Midoriya starts off as a Quirkless teen who can only dream of becoming a hero in a world full of them. After being recognized by his lifelong idol, All Might, he gains the powerful quirk One For All, giving him a chance at becoming the number one hero. Although he has to keep training his newfound power, he gets plenty of opportunities to fight villains and save others.
-   _Naruto_ starts out almost completely untalented and overconfident, but once he finds his friends, he realizes what it means to be a hero and fights to protect them.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Monkey King Lite Luffy once was a loud, ambitious kid from a small village in the East Blue ocean, which is commonly regarded as "unremarkable" compared to the other big seas in the world. He then forms the Straw Hat Pirates with only a small crew (all of whom have their own humble beginnings) and proceeds to make a name for themselves as they venture between islands in search for the titular One Piece. Post Time Skip, the crew is considered one of the most infamous, especially as they have tangled with at least 2 major governmental facilities, and Luffy having a very high bounty.
    -   Luffy's foil Koby was much the same way. He started out as just a random kid who was the first friend Luffy made on his journey when he rescued him from a life of slavery, and aspired to be a hero like him but on the opposite side as a Marine. Thanks to Training from Hell from Luffy's Marine grandfather Monkey D. Garp, he becomes a Captain with Charles Atlas Superpower and Ki Manipulation equivalent to early post-Time Skip Luffy. Same goes for Koby's partner-in-crime Helmeppo, who started out as his enemy and was a powerless Spoiled Brat but Took a Level in Badass alongside him.
-   While Saitama in _One-Punch Man_ starts out as a would-be salaryman with no real goal in life, he realizes he wants to be a hero and starts training like mad. However, when he finally reaches his goal, being able to lay waste to any villain or monster with a single punch due to his _ridiculous_ strength, he becomes _really_ bored with this. Subverted in that, despite his heroism, nobody recognizes his feats and sees him as a very plain hero, even though he is anything but. Though admittedly, he does still _look_ like an average guy and acts like one when he is not fighting.
-   Ash Ketchum from _Pokémon: The Series_ starts out with his ambition To Be a Master, but his knowledge and skills are clearly sub-par. Fortunately, his Determinator spirit and The Power of Friendship help him grow into a truly competitive trainer and prove himself The Chosen One on multiple occasions, eventually allowing him to win the Alola League and become a champion before eventually becoming the World's Best Warrior.
-   Tsunayoshi Sawada from _Reborn! (2004)_. At school all his grades are zero, he is impossibly clumsy, smaller than everyone in his class, has no out-of-school activities whatsoever (unless you count reading manga and playing video games), has absolutely no friends, and is berated both by his mother (though that was toned down in the anime) and at school. He even gets stuck with the nickname "Dame-Tsuna". By the end of the series he has obtained amazing power, is an expert in combat, has a very wide circle of friends and allies that would die for him and has managed to defeat his setting's Eldritch Abominations, among other deeds. No improvement in his grades though.
-   Lint begins _Rise Of The Outlaw Tamer_ as a nobody D-Rank adventurer. Less than a month after meeting A-Rank adventurer Belina, he is a renowned B-Rank Dragon Tamer with an absurdly powerful Battle Harem who can hit well above his stated weight class.
-   Simon from _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ starts out as a digger in an underground village, when he gets a hold of a mecha. Continuously getting inspired by big bro and mentor Kamina, this leads to his journey above ground, where he begins to fight Ganmen on his way to Lordgenome. The levels of greatness keep piling up until Simon and his allies are fighting in galaxy-sized mechas.

By then, she was the Naïve Newcomer Ascended Fangirl. By the time the comic book was ending, she became a guerrilla leader and then the leader of the last remaining mutants, and in _Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand_ she saved the planet by using her power (and a little help from SHIELD to become a giant) to disrupt Galactus' machines.

    Literature 

-   _Animorphs_
    -   The entire main cast qualifies, being ordinary teenagers before blundering through a construction site at the wrong time and ending up as Earth's only resistance against the Yeerk invasion. In the epilogue of the series, they're considered war heroes, though only Marco really capitalizes on it.
    -   Prince Elfangor, the hero who gave the Animorphs the power to morph, started out as a lowly cadet who kept getting his ass kicked in combat training. By the end of _The Andalite Chronicles_, he's loved and respected as a hero throughout the Andalite military.
    -   Aldrea, formerly the daughter of the disgraced Seerow, was expecting to spend the rest of her days Reassigned to Antarctica with the rest of her family. Then the Yeerks show up and she ends up leading her own resistance movement; after teaming up with Dak Hamee and Going Native, she soon ends up as one of the Hork-Bajir's folk heroes.
    -   By far the greatest example of this has to be the Ellimist: originally an unmotivated gamer with no ambitions in life, a series of cataclysmic disasters sees him become the leader of a Dying Race, then a genius Mind Hive inhabiting a Sapient Ship, then an entire fleet - and then the nearest thing this setting has to _God_ and the Animorph's most powerful ally.
-   In _Earth's Children_, Ayla goes from an orphaned outcast to a widely respected and admired healer and shaman, who helps many people in various ways; in the fourth book she even helps save a whole tribe from a tyrannical leader and restores order.
-   _The Elminster Series_: The titulat Elminster went from an unlucky boy farmer to becoming The Arch Mage and one of the most powerful heroes of the world of Abeir-Toril.

However, after finding himself blessed with Born-Again Immortality via "Groundhog Day" Loop, Harry becomes an adventurer, a journalist, a scientist, a secret agent, and ultimately the last hope of the Kronus Club and the human race - over the course of multiple lifetimes. For good measure, because of the nature of his immortality, Harry always begins his latest life with the same lowly status he had the first time around.
-   _Harry Potter_, a short boy living with an abusive family, receives a letter from a half-giant who informs him that he is a wizard, enrolls in the magic school Hogwarts, and learns that he is already incredibly famous in this wizarding world.

-   Invoked in _Helen and Troy's Epic Road Quest_. While the National Questing Bureau tries having trained agents take on the role of questing, most of the time it's some normal schmoe who finds themselves having to go on daring adventures whether they like it or not. All the National Questing Bureau can do really is find them, fill them in on what they're in for, provide travel expenses and let it happen.
    
    **Neil Waechter:** We've tried having trained questers in the NQB, but it never really worked out. Even if you put them in the right place at the right time, they never get picked. it's always some poor sap who happens to be walking by, some unfortunate farm kid, a bank teller, a reluctant rogue. it's never the guy or gal who should be saddled with the burden. It's always the one you don't expect.
    
-   Being from one of the poorest districts, Katniss Everdeen volunteers for _The Hunger Games_ to protect her younger sister, having to fight for her life and getting tangled in a political game.

-   _Mistborn: The Original Trilogy_:
    -   Sazed is a Terrisman, which means he is a born servant, meek and obedient, and castrated to boot. Over the course of the original trilogy, he becomes more and more important for the protagonists, until by the end of _Hero of Ages_ he becomes Physical God and uses his extensive knowledge to save the world.
    -   Vin is an street child, a literal Daughter of a Whore, as her mother was a skaa prostitute (skaa are the setting's oppressed working class, treated like cattle by the nobles). In _Mistborn_ she defeats Lord Ruler, who has oppressed Scadrial for generations, which by itself would make her a hero. But that's only the beginning — by the end of _Hero of Ages_ she saves the world, kills a god and dies heroically in the process.
    -   Spook is another skaa urchin, although at least he has a home, as he was taken in by his uncle. He is the youngest in Kelsier's crew (apart from Vin), speaks in an almost unintelligible street slang and while he has Allomantic abilities, they give him only heightened senses. This also makes him open to insidious whispers of the setting's Big Bad Ruin but he finally comes to his senses and saves the people of Urteau. He is also Legendary in the Sequel — in _Wax and Wayne_ he is called Lord Mistborn and his street slang is treated like Latin in our world.
-   _Warrior Cats_:
    -   During the first arc, the main character starts as a normal, young house cat named Rusty. By the end of the series, he's saved all four Clans several times, and has become the first kittypet-born leader in the Clans' history.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Good Place_: This is the arc of at least the first two seasons. Eleanor starts off as a scrappy scammer in telemarketing, with no interest in academia or helping others. When she dies, Chidi has to help her learn philosophy so that she may improve herself so that she might get into the Good Place. She eventually becomes good enough to get into The Good Place (and opts not to go), the leader of the team that figured out nobody had entered the Good Place, and convinced the Judge to reevaluate the state of the Good Place.
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   The original Zordon Era (Mighty Morphin to In Space) begins with five ordinary teenagers being recruited to combat the forces of evil. The _In Space_ crew (which is not the same one from Mighty Morphin) went from being replacements for the previous team (also not the same one from Mighty Morphin) to being the ones who defeated every single Big Bad of the Zordon Era.
    -   _Power Rangers Lost Galaxy_: The Red Ranger Leo is first introduced being denied entry to the space colony of Terra Venture due to not having a passport. He isn't even the one who pulls out the Red Quasar Saber - that was his brother Mike who gave the saber to Leo before seemingly dying. Despite his less-than-ideal start, Leo ultimately rises to the occasion and becomes the leader of the Power Rangers.
    -   _Power Rangers: Dino Thunder_: Conner, Ethan and Kira are high school students of very different social circles who are bonded by their fight against evil.
    -   _Power Rangers S.P.D._: The B-Squad Rangers go from a team of bickering rookies to the saviors of Earth.
-   _Smallville_ explores Clark Kent's journey from awkward and confused teenager to the hero the world will know as Superman.

    Music 

-   Lampshaded in the 1943 song "Johnny Got a Zero" (also known as "Johnny Zero"), which tells the story of a boy whose classmates taunt him as "Johnny Zero" because of his failures in school. When he becomes a World War II fighter pilot, "Johnny Zero" is lauded as a hero for his success in downing enemy Zero planes.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   Jesus Christ, according to _The Bible_ and Christian belief. Born to a teen mother in a stable, raised by a carpenter, and the member of an ethnic group that was subservient to a large empire, Jesus became known as the "King of the Jews" and the Messiah, savior of man. He became a symbol of resistance to the empire (sort of) and inspired the world's largest religion, who regard him as the Son of God.

    Podcasts 

-   _The Adventure Zone: Balance_: The Director started off as the record-maker of the IPE, writing down everything the other more active members were doing. It was only through the Stolen Century that she became the proactive, decisive leader she would become.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _The One Ring_: Adventurers start the game as nobodies and might have even more hardship in their Background. If they distinguish themselves in deed, they can end their career as high-ranking, well-respected public figures whose heroics are recognized far beyond their homelands.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_: Many of the starting careers are the dregs of society, but player characters who survive the Early Game Hell can rise to eminence and renown — even a peasant farmer can become a powerful noble, a Wizard Lord, or a mighty champion.

    Video Games 

-   The _Ace Combat_ franchise has the Player Character start off as an anonymous low-ranking fighter pilot, but as the game progresses, allied units will start breathing a sigh of relief now that their premier ace pilot is here to provide air support, while the enemy side will either see the pilot's arrival as an Oh, Crap! moment or, if it's an enemy ace, as a Worthy Opponent.
-   _Battle for Wesnoth_: The protagonist of _Northern Rebirth_, Tallin, starts out as a slave to the orcish rulers of the Dwarven Doors. Over the course of the campaign, he rallies fellow slaves to free themselves by exploiting their master's conflict with a new orcish alliance, allies himself with various races of the northlands, and finally leads said alliance to defeat the orcish one. At the end of the campaign, his allies decide to become a formal entity named Northern Aliiance and unanimously elects Tallin as their leader.
-   Bethesda Softworks games, in addition to the _Elder Scrolls_ series below, uses this trope extensively.
    -   Most _Fallout_ games utilize this trope, with an average person ascending to savior/scourge/wildcard of their region of the Wasteland. The numbered series protagonists (the Vault Dweller, the Chosen One, and the Lone Wanderer) fit this trope absolutely to a tee. An exception is _Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel_, where you're already a trained Elite Mook before the game begins.
    -   Played With in _Fallout: New Vegas_, where you're a traveling Courier (who are generally known to be badasses, to survive constant travel in the Wastes). Even the Courier, however, fits the spirit of this trope due to the Reputation mechanic of the game, where you go from being completely unknown and dismissed by every faction and tribe in the Mojave to the main entity that _every_ side seeks to either recruit or destroy at all costs.
-   The backstory to _Doom_ 1993 is the Marine was sent to Mars as a punishment posting, watching the researchers of the United Aerospace Corporation do science-y stuff. Once things get dicey with the UAC's dimensional teleporters, the Marines head to Phobos to check on things. A Space Marine Is You gets left behind to guard the shuttlecraft with only a pistol while the rest of the squad goes in for a looksee. After some gunfire and screaming, the radio goes silent. The lone Marine must now fight his way through hordes of hellspawn to get back home. "Hell at last plays fair ..."
-   _Dragon Age: Origins_: Zig-zagged depending on the selected origin of the Warden. The Human Noble and Dwarf Noble origins give the player a chance to start out at the top, the other origins are much humbler by far. They include a newly-graduated mage with no prestige, a simple Dalish hunter eking out a living in the forests, a City Elf living in a Fantastic Ghetto at the mercy of bullying humans, or a Casteless Dwarf struggling to support your prostituted sister and alcoholic mother by working as a legbreaker for the Carta. Regardless of your origin, the end of the game will see you known and celebrated throughout the world as the Hero of Ferelden, to the point that in the DLC, bandits will _fling themselves off cliffs rather than fight you._
-   _Dragon: Marked for Death_: The protagonist starts off reviled and looked down upon by almost everyone due to being a member of the Dragonblood Clan, but over the course of the game wins the respect and admiration of most people.
-   Every game in _The Elder Scrolls_ series has the Player Character become one of these in both the main story and faction quests (although since its a sandbox game you can go From Nobody to Nightmare as well), generally Because Destiny Says So (although how much each character's mentioned in the sequels vary).
    -   _Arena_: You go from a random (but loyal) Imperial guardsman to the Emperor's savior.
    -   _Daggerfall_: You begin as an acquaintance of the Emperor and go on to decide who gains control of a Lost Superweapon.
    -   _Morrowind_: You begin as an Imperial prisoner the Emperor's sent in. You're the Neverine, the reincarnation of an ancient hero (although it's implied you might have taken on the role by being a hero rather than destined for it).
    -   _Oblivion_: You start off as a common criminal in a cell. Then you meet the Emperor, witness his assassination and go on to become the Champion of Cyrodill.
    -   _Skyrim_: You pick a bad time to cross the border into a wartorn Skyrim and come within a hair's breadth of being executed after being mistaken for an enemy. You turn out to be The Dragonborn and must prevent The End of the World as We Know It, as well as decide the outcome of the civil war.
-   _Fallout_, in a similar vein to _Elder Scrolls_, has your character go from humble beginnings to deciding the fate of large swaths of the American wastelands.
    -   _Fallout_: You leave your Vault because its water chip broke down, and need to get a new one before your remaining water stores run out and everyone dies. Along the way, you discover, and subsequently crush, a rising army of Super Mutants.
    -   _Fallout 2_: You set out to find the GECK, a top-secret pre-war device that can convert arid wasteland into fertile farmland. You succeed in not only doing that, but defeating a neo-fascist military faction.
    -   _Fallout 3_: Your dad has lest the Vault, and you've gone out in search of him. Along the way, you wipe out the remnants of the neo-fascist military faction that was stinking up the other side of the country.
    -   _Fallout: New Vegas_: Your adventure begins with you shot in the head and buried in a shallow grave, saved from certain death by a robotic good Samaritan. You would then go on to become the deciding factor in the three-way war between the local government, the marauding horde of slavers, and the eccentric billionaire who holds control over the Hoover Dam.
    -   _Fallout 4_ zig-zags this with your character's pre-established history as a veteran soldier (or his wife) before the Great War. Then your family gets frozen. Then you are briefly thawed to watch your spouse get murdered and your son get kidnapped. Then you break free into the post-apocalyptic wastes and shape the face of a Boston caught in a war between a shadowy cabal of mad scientists sending Ridiculously Human Robots into the wastes, a _new_ neo-fascist military faction, and an underground resistance movement (plus the local peacekeeping militia, if you help them return from the brink). Depending on who you help, you can also establish several thriving communities.
-   _Fate/Grand Order_: The Protagonist is mentioned to be an ordinary boy/girl with an ordinary life, who didn't know anything about magecraft until they're scouted by the Chaldea Organization to be one of the potential Masters (i.e those who control Servants); even as they're detected to have very high Master aptitude, they're noted to be lacking in magic potential. They become the only hope for saving humanity after the Big Bad's "incineration of humanity" in the prologue; with limited initial knowledge and resources, they and Chaldea have to stop the Big Bad's plans and somehow undo what he did. They're awkward about the whole thing at first, but over time they've become proficient to the point that by the final scenario, the Big Bad is finally taking them seriously, and in one of the "bonus scenarios" one of the new minor villains is appalled on how an average joe like the protagonist could beat the Big Bad by himself.
-   In _Final Fantasy XIV_, the Warrior of Light is some nobody adventurer that came out of the woodwork among _many_ identically capable individuals who began their journeys at the same time. But the Warrior soon becomes a famed god-slayer, a One-Man Army, and eventually the World's Best Warrior, thwarting the villains' plans at every turn. Archbishop Thordan found this out the hard way, explicitly planning around the Warrior's intervention only to still be slain after he became a primal. All he could do at that point was be terrified and ask what they were as he dies.
-   _Guild Wars 2_, depending on your character choices. If you play as a Human (Street Rat or Commoner) or Charr, you start of as an ordinary, lower-class citizen or low-ranking soldier, but over the course of the game rise to become commander of the Pact, slayer of the Elder Dragon Zhaitan, and save the world multiple times. If you play as a Norn or Asura your background averts the Zero aspect of the trope, as you start as the winner of the Great Hunt and a recognized genius respectively.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   Admiral Steven Hackett was born to a single mother and orphaned at age 12 when she died in a plague. He enlisted at 18 and after four years of volunteering for high-risk missions, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. He spent the next 30 years working his way towards Admiral. In _Mass Effect 3_, he becomes the de facto leader of humanity during the Reaper War.
    -   Commander Shepard can have one of three origin stories, each of them perfectly ordinary by the setting's standards. They then go on to lead the entire galaxy to victory over the Reapers, and the epilogue of _Mass Effect 3_ reveals that "the Shepard" is remembered and respected for thousands of years afterward.
-   _Metroid_: Samus Aran began life as just a colony kid on a mining planet, until she was three years old when Ridley led the Space Pirates in a massacre of her colony, which killed her parents and left her the only survivor. The Chozo adopted her and raised her to become a galactic protector. After Ridley and his Space Pirates essentially killed off the Chozo, she dedicates her life to bringing an end to the pirates, especially Ridley. Following her initial adventures, Samus has come to be seen as The Dreaded by the Space Pirates and a Living Legend by everyone else, whose exploits are so incredible that many common soldiers don't even believe she exists.
-   Subverted and parodied in _Peasant's Quest_. The hero, Rather Dashing, is a humble peasant who dwells in a thatched-roof cottage. He swears to save the land by slaying the dragon Trogdor who has been menacing the countryside and goes on an epic quest. Rather Dashing completely fails at his goal, and gets burninated to death in the final boss battle.
-   _Persona 5_: The Player Character goes from misunderstood delinquent to the world's savior.
-   This trope is namedropped with the unique ability of the Pokémon Palafin, which is based on traditional comic book superheroes. When first sent out into battle, Palafin is virtually indistinguishable from its pre-evolved form Finizen, save for the heart-shaped crest on its underbelly, and, aside from its serviceable Speed, has somewhat poor stats. This is referred to as its 'Zero form'. However, when it is switched out (either manually or with the Flip Turn attack) and subsequently brought back into battle, Palafin takes on its 'Hero form', which changes its appearance to look more like a superhero, and boosts up its offensive and defensive stats (especially its frightening physical attack, which eclipses that of many legendary Pokémon).
-   _Sun Haven_ has the player character, known as the Farmer. They initially start out taking over some dilapidated and untended farmland. By following the main story line, however, they eventually become a diplomat who manages to broken a peace treaty between Sun Haven and the isolationists Ne'lvari and Withergate, ending countless centuries of hostilities, and going through Herculean trials all over the regions with or without ever getting into combat. Such feats include retrieving valuable magical minerals from the depths of dangerous wildernesses; deciphering a lost ancient language and piecing together the clues to rediscover an intentionally Hidden Elf Village; breaking through an ancient and powerful magical barrier and infiltrating a massive monster metropolis; and either putting up a king's ransom to satisfy Dynus the Moon Dragon, or fighting him in single combat until he yields and recognizes them as an equal.
-   The Volunteer from _XCOM: Enemy Unknown_ is a mechanical example: every soldier in the game is recruited as a level 1 newbie with no special qualities, but in the final act, one of them will become the Volunteer, i.e. the most powerful human psychic on the planet who sacrifices themselves to thwart the ongoing alien invasion.
-   At the start of _Yakuza: Like a Dragon_ Ichiban Kasuga is a 42 year old bottom barrel ex-Yakuza who after a disastrous reunion with his former boss is dumped on the streets of Ijincho with nothing but a bullethole and the clothes on his back. By the end of the game he not only manages to gather a group of loyal friends from all circles but becomes a fringe politician and potentially a local captain of industry who becomes a champion of the poor and disenfranchised as well as a major thorn in the side of the Governor of Tokyo.

    Web Animation 

-   _Red vs. Blue_: The Reds and Blues of Blood Gulch start out as two squads of Armed Farces assigned to a box canyon in the middle of nowhere. Through a combination of dumb luck and their own stupidity, they stumble upon evil plots, which they manage to resolve through a combination of dumb luck and scrapping together their few braincells to win. This eventually escalates to their saving the Planet Chorus and becoming celebrated heroes.

    Webcomics 

-   _Darwin Carmichael Is Going to Hell_: For much of the story, Darwin Carmichael is a Loser Protagonist who's stuck in a dead-end job in New York City, constantly being tormented by his wacky friends. At the end of the comic, he ends up stopping the apocalypse and saving the world through a Heroic Sacrifice.
-   _Looking for Group_: Pervasive Butt-Monkey and Failure Hero tendencies aside, Cale'Anon starts off as naive and ditzy, but _very_ slowly awakens to his destiny as a hero — ending the war with Legara and re-establishing the lost city of Kethenecia.
-   _Oglaf_.
    -   Subverted with the titular character, a humble shepherd boy who is apparently The Chosen One and destined for greatness, but he never realizes his destiny due to being illiterate and thus unable to read the prophesies.
    -   Also, the Blowjob King starts off as an ordinary low-ranking soldier and adventurer. After being cursed to be the best at blowjobs, he uses his skill to save the kingdom from invaders, ending the war and becoming king. Later on, he also saves the kingdom from a guy whose sexual powers are causing destruction.

    Western Animation 

-   _Ben 10_ started out as Ben Tennyson, a regular 10-year-old boy with a normal life. Then, while going on a road trip with his grandpa and cousin, he encounters the Omnitrix, a watch that can transform him into 10 different aliens with different superpowers. From then on, Ben was no longer a normal kid with a boring life; now he's a hero who saves the day 24/7!
-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_: It's revealed that Numbuh 1 used to be just a normal kid, to the point where Numbuh 5 had to hack into the Kids Next Door database in order to give him a passing grade to get into the organization. By the end of the series, he's become the single greatest Kids Next Door operative on the planet.
-   _Danny Phantom_ has shades of this (which is to be expected of something reminiscent of _Spider-Man_). Danny Fenton is a unpopular freshman who gains ghost powers and has to fight against the supernatural.
-   Gary from _Final Space_ starts out as a loser and eventually goes on to save the entire universe.
-   _Hercules: The Animated Series_: The titular character might be a scrawny kid who is an outsider, but being a son of Zeus, he was born with tremendous strength. Hercules is a hero-in-training still in "geek god" mode, before his "Zero to Hero" transformation. In addition, _Hercules: Zero to Hero_ is a direct-to-video follow-up to the 1997 animated feature released on 1999, serving as a package film combining three episodes of _Hercules: The Animated Series_ as flashback segments.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: The Mane Six started out as six ordinary foals — unbeknownst to them united by the same incident. Twilight becomes Princess Celestia's personal student, and then when they form a bond of Fire Forged Friendship, they go on to save the world multiple times, and Twilight Sparkle becomes the Princess of Friendship.
-   _Steven Universe_: Lars Barriga started as a lazy, surly slacker, barely trying unless it personally interested him, who wanted to be respected and enjoyed by his peers but went about it the complete wrong way due to his own insecurities; the one thing he had a serious passion for was cooking, but he never showed it in fear of being looked down on. The final season forces Lars into a situation where he learns to be brave in spite of his fears, taking charge and becoming a confident Hero of Another Story who does what he loves no matter what other people think.
-   _Transformers_: In many continuities where his origin is explored, Optimus Prime is shown to come from humble beginnings before he rises as the leader of the Autobots. These include being a dock worker, a washed out cadet and a "data clerk".
