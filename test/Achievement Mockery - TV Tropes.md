Video game achievements are awarded for all sorts of things. Sometimes they are awarded for accomplishing something legitimately difficult. Sometimes they are awarded for doing something that required no effort at all. And then there are these.

Achievement Mockery is when you are awarded for either doing something really, really stupid, or for playing the game poorly; whether it be dying a certain amount of times, finding a specific Non-Standard Game Over, completely screwing yourself out of making further progress in the game, or just doing something the developers decided to have the game mock you for. As a kind of jab at the player, these achievements are ones that, more often than not, players either don't want to get, or only go for because of trying to achieve 100% Completion.

May be a result of Easy-Mode Mockery or a character who Wins by Doing Absolutely Nothing. Compare Yet Another Stupid Death, as well as Earn Your Bad Ending, where you have to be actively trying to end the game on a bad note. Also compare Completion Mockery, which has the game make fun of you for wasting your time completing it. Sub-Trope of Take That, Audience!.

See Medal of Dishonor for dishonorable rewards being awarded In-Universe.

## Examples:

### **Video game examples:**

    open/close all folders 

    Action Games 

-   The _Assassin's Creed_ series has a few achievements for doing random or counterintuitive things.
    -   _Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood_ has "Your Wish Is Granted" for throwing money in a well, which does nothing except waste money.
    -   _Assassin's Creed: Revelations_ gives "Monster's dance" for having a guard incapacitate three civilians while he's poisoned.
-   The Flash game _Amorphous+_. You get awards for dying a number of times, as well as dying in multiple ways. And it's needed for 100% Completion, as it's the only way to get more reward keys.
-   In _Asura's Wrath_, the "View of the Valley" achievement is awarded for staring too long at a girl's bust during the Hot Springs Episode.
-   _Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening_:
    -   The game has a mild example of this on the completion screen for Easy difficulty.
        
        Prequel doesn't mean you can be a newbie.
        
    -   While the game compliments players for SS ranking all missions on Normal and Hard, Very Hard (Special Edition) and Dante Must Die instead reward them with biting remarks:
        
        **Very Hard:** All this, and you didn't break the controller!
        
        **Dante Must Die:** Man, you need to get out more.
        
-   The HD version of _God of War_ has two of these. The first is the aptly-named "Zero Health = Bronze Trophy", awarded for opening a Health Chest when your health meter is already full. The second is "Getting My Ass Kicked", awarded for dying enough times to get offered Easy mode.
-   _L.A. Noire_ has "Public Menace" for racking up $47000 in penalties during a single story case.
-   In _Lollipop Chainsaw_:
    -   The "I Swear! I Did It By Mistake!" achievement is awarded for looking up Juliet's skirt.
    -   The "Gunn Struck" trophy is awarded for being struck by lightning (or shocked by Vikke's electrical attacks) ten times.
-   In _Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands_, you can permanently lower your current difficulty any time in the game. Doing this earns you the achievement "Our Little Secret".
-   The PS4 ports of _Star Wars: Jedi Outcast_ and _Jedi Academy_ includes all sorts of wacky trophies for dying in various absurd manners (falling in lava, missing a platform, being eaten by a rancor, etc.), as well as a few that outright _reward_ Video Game Cruelty Potential, requiring you to do very non-Jedilike things such as killing helpless NPCs or torturing enemies with your Force powers. You also get a trophy calling you out for beating a level with cheats if you do so, complete with disabling any trophies you would have gotten from completing the level legitimately.
-   _Yakuza 0_ has a trophy for having Kiryu or Majima watch an erotic video, appropriately titled "...I Did It for the Trophy". The game also has an achievement for being smashed on the head with a bottle during a quick-time event in a fight scene.

    Action-Adventure Games 

-   _Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon_: The multiplayer mode gives achievements to everyone at the end of each level, based on what they did the most of or did particularly well. Anyone who doesn't get any other type of award gets one of a few mocking achievements, such as 'Prettiest Wallflower' and 'Mostly Harmless'.
-   _Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered_ awards "Warning Label" if Lucas dies by taking pills and booze together.

    Adventure Games 

-   In _Don't Shit Your Pants_, you receive an achievement if you type in "shit" and have your character soil themselves before the game even begins.
-   A similar achievement returns in _Don't Wet Your Pants_ (typing in "pee" before the game begins) as well as "Doing It Wrong" if you enter the command to defecate instead of urinate.
-   Due to its nature, _Heavy Rain_ has a few of these.
    -   "Agoraphobia" for knocking down 50 (innocent) people during Ethan's claustrophobia-induced trance.
    -   "Blunder" for shooting Nathaniel, which the game all but tricks you into doing even though he's harmless.
    -   "Coward!" for giving up or failing the Butterfly Trial.
    -   "Bad Cop" for doing nothing to stop Blake from beating up Dupré.
    -   "Hands Up!" for getting arrested by Blake.
    -   "So Close..." for failing after making it to the end with all four characters still alive.
    -   "Perfect Crime" for basically letting the villain get away free without leaving any evidence or witnesses, though it's a hell of a time to actually get this one.
-   _Ittle Dew_ has an achievement for being hit by a projectile you just teleported.
-   _Kings Quest (2015)_ has achievements which are unlocked by doing things such as _being eaten by a dragon_.
-   _The Oregon Trail (2021)_ awards "You have died of dysentery" when a party member dies of dysentery, "Smithereens" when your wagon suffers a Nitro Express accident, and "Sky High" when a party member is killed by a nitro explosion.
-   _Poptropica_: Mocktropica Island, which is themed around video game design and parodying common trends, introduces an achievement system that the game normally doesn't have. They start off as minor annoyances, but turn sarcastic and insulting, with descriptions such as "break the curd machine and force the designer to return to his miserable old job" and "find a man in a perfect zen setting, destroy that, throw him back into the rat race." The very last part of the island is where you repeatedly shoot coins at an achievement popup, causing it to shatter... and then you get an achievement for that, too.
-   _Stray_ has two examples:
    -   "Curiosity Killed the Cat" for interacting with a paper bag, which then gets stuck on the cat's head and blinds them (as represented with Interface Screw) until it falls off.
    -   "No More Lives" for dying at least nine times, either to Zurk mobs or Sentinel bullets.

    Beat 'em Ups 

-   In the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Steam _Sega Genesis Classics_ Compilation Rerelease, if, while playing _Golden Axe_, you use your potions when no enemies are on screen, you get an achievement called 'What Are The Buttons?'.
-   _River City Girls_ has the "Killed By Math" achievement, given out for being defeated in the first room of the game.

    Card Battle Game 

-   _Touhou Lost Branch Of Legend_: The player gets the Misplayed award worth 100 points:
    
    Deal lethal damage to oneself.
    

    Fighting Games 

-   _Dead or Alive 4_ has the "20 Straight Losses in DOA Online" trophy. As you can guess, it requires you to lose 20 times in a row in online matches. To add insult to injury, it doesn't even award any Gs.
-   _Shrek SuperSlam_: The Pause Master trophy is unlocked by pausing the game 100 times: an achievement you can get as soon as you start a match. The trophy's description even points out how desperate you'd have to be to try for it:
    
    For a hero who is desperate for a trophy. Any trophy.
    
-   The PSN/XBLA versions of _Sonic the Fighters_ give you a trophy/achievement just for being Squashed Flat (well, squashed down to a short size, anyway).
-   Earlier installments of _Super Smash Bros._ deduct points from your score for things such as dropping items while trying to use them, blowing yourself up with bombs or capsules, allowing your shield to break, deliberately breaking your own shield, taking cheap shots, and making no attempt to recover after being knocked off the stage. And you _have_ to get all of them if you want the Diskun trophy (which requires you to earn every bonus and penalty in the game).

    First-Person Shooters 

-   _AMID EVIL_ has the "A Real Klutz" achievement. To obtain this one, you need to get every possible special death message, one of which can only be obtained through one of the final boss's attacks or the Super Mode of one of your own weapons. There's also "Abysmal," which is for dying in the Gateway.
-   The _Battlefield_ series has the Purple Heart, achieved from a certain kill/death ratio depending on game (1:5 for _1942_, 1:4 for _2_, and 1:2 for _2142_).
    -   Later entries in the series also 'reward' the player with a Comeback Bonus, which gives you a pathetically small number of bonus points (which in and of themselves mean almost nothing) for getting a kill after several deaths in a row without killing anyone.
-   _Black Mesa_ has achievements for getting killed by your own snarks, getting killed by a headcrab, cooking a grenade until it explodes in your hand, overcharging the Tau Cannon (which inflicts massive damage on the user), getting zapped by the Anti-Mass Spectrometer, getting flung into oblivion by the Gonarch, and even drowning in the Lambda Reactor Coolant System.
-   _Deep Rock Galactic_ has the "Darwin Award" achievement for killing yourself with the barrel fire hoop while drunk.
-   _Doom Eternal_ has an achievement called "Ow", with an image of the Doom Slayer giving a thumbs up with a bandaged hand, that pops if you try and punch a (thick metal) slayer gate. Another called, "Phew, that was a close one" is granted for blowing a room-clearing BFG shot on a single zombie and nothing else.
-   In _Duke Nukem 3D_, tip a virtual stripper who takes her top off and you'll get the 10G trophy "Shake It, Baby".
-   The _Half-Life 2_ mod _Entropy : Zero_ has the "Bullet Hangover" achievement for dying 100 times.
-   _First Encounter Assault Recon_ awards "Suicide King" for the Pointman killing himself five times, most likely to occur via grenade mishaps.
-   _Frontlines: Fuel of War_ has a zero-point achievement named "Noob" for suiciding 10 times in a multiplayer game.
-   _GoldenEye: Source_ has a few, including "004," which is awarded for blowing yourself up 25 times with your own mines, "Octopussy" for excessive camping, and "Who Throws a Shoe?", which is awarded to someone who plays as Oddjob (who is widely considered unfair to use due to being smaller and therefore harder to hit, as well as having a borderline-broken Razor Hat) for essentially being the worst player in the round. Then there's the Awards, which are given every match, that point out similar things, and they're similarly both doled out for genuine skill — or a lack thereof.
-   _High Hell_ has a secret achievement for getting killed in under 5 seconds.
-   A _Modern Warfare_ player who fails to kill anyone in a multiplayer round, and dies at least ten times, gets an achievement.
-   In _Neon White_ in order to get the "Idiot Achivement", you need to do one of Neon Violet's sidequest stages, titled "Hellevator". The stage has you Stomping through a series of breakable floors down a shaft towards the goal, however if you don't pay attention to the floor numbers and go too far past the floor limit, you'll end up on a small speck of land with nothing but a sign that reads "Idiot Island" with no way off except dying or resetting.
-   _PAYDAY 2_ has over 1,000 achievements to its name, so it should be no surprise it has one in the form of "F in Chemistry", which can be earned by blowing up the meth lab on Rats or Cook Off by putting in the wrong meth ingredients.
-   _Postal 2_ has the "It's sterile and I like the taste" achievement, which requires you to make your character piss onto their own face.
-   In _Prey (2017)_, there are two such achievements. First, "No Show", which requires the player to kill themselves on the helicopter blades of the transport to take them to work on their first day (the prologue, before doing anything of importance at all). Second, there is "Intrinsic Value", which requires the player to recycle themselves (that is, to kill themselves using a Recycler Charge).
-   _Serious Sam_ has a variety of achievements falling under this category, with each game (sometimes) having at least one, such as:
    -   "Impossible," a vaguely-named achievement in the Serious Sam Classics: Revolution version, with the just-as-vague description "This achievement is impossible to get." The achievement requires you survive five real-life minutes with only one point of health remaining, making it impossible to unlock on the Tourist difficulty that has health regeneration enabled.
    -   The Siberian Mayhem side-mission "Alpha and Omega" has the objective of disabling a force field generator, with the player being allowed to complete a puzzle to do so. The achievement "All Ingenious is Shot" can be unlocked by ignoring the puzzle in favor of blowing up the generator, whereas the achievement "All Ingenious is Hard" with the description "You are here to shoot, right?" requires finding a much more difficult solution to the puzzle.
    -   Serious Sam 4's achievement "Brass Lantern" is completed by doing a side-mission that involves you playing a text-based adventure game to unlock a few pickups, blatantly ignoring the primary objective of escaping the oil rig you're on to head back to an important battle.
-   In the Xbox 360 version of _Secret Service_, shooting the president earns you the zero-point achievement "The Exact Opposite of Your Job". There's also the "Drop The Pin..." achievement, which you get for killing yourself with your own grenade, and the "Expert Marksman" achievement, which you get by firing an entire magazine without hitting anything.
-   _Star Wars: Battlefront_ awarded the various units after battles based on their performance with titles. For instance, "Tank Buster" went to whoever destroyed the most vehicles, and "Dead Eye" for whoever scored the most headshots. But then there's "Camper" (most time spent in any one spot, not including turns), "Traitor" (most team-kills), and "Bantha Fodder" (most deaths).
-   _Star Trek: Elite Force_ games give the Red Shirt award in a multiplayer game to those who manage to die first.
-   _Team Fortress 2_'s Sniper vs. Spy update introduced the Sniper's "Consolation Prize" achievement for being Back Stabbed 50 times. This can be especially ironic if the achievement causes you to reach Sniper Milestone 3, that would reward you with the Razorback, a shield that keeps you from being backstabbed.
-   In _Tribes: Ascend_, one of the accolades that earns you points is "llama grab", gotten when you pick up a flag at a very low speed — which is likely to result in you dying before you get much of anywhere with it, screwing up a faster-moving teammate's grab attempt, and dropping the flag somewhere that's harder for you to pick up until the flag automatically goes back to the stand. While it still gives you points, it's less than even a standard flag grab and the description even says "not for use in any highlight reels".

    Hidden Object Games 

-   _Awakening 7: The Golden Age_ has the "Murderer" achievement for trying to use a razor on some sleeping gnolls.
-   _Puppet Show 6: Lightning Strikes_ has the "Reckless Detective" and "Pushy" achievements for using investigation cards wrongly and using an incorrect item five times in a row on the same hot spot, respectively.
-   _Puppet Show 8: The Face of Humanity_ has the "Are You Really a Detective?" achievement for trying to use a knife on the gendarme who demands authorization at the start of the game.

    Idle Games 

-   _Cookie Clicker_ has one, in particular, that was introduced when the ability to rename the bakery was added - attempting to name the bakery "Orteil"('s bakery) (after the game's creator) awards the Shadow Achievement (which does not add to the milk percentage, unlike regular achievements) "God Complex," which calls out the player for not being the game's creator. As of version 2.0 and later, it's even worse - the achievement puts a -1% modifier on all cookie production while the bakery is named after Orteil. And anyone who spells it "Ortiel" instead gets a -2% modifier.
-   _Kittens Game_: Any achievement with a red-coloured border is essentially a Mark of Shame and often obtained by doing something bad:
    -   The "Winter is Coming" and "You Monster" Achievements are awarded to players who had 10 and 100 kittens starve to death respectively in one run, presumably as a form of Video Game Cruelty Punishment.
    -   The achievement "Super Unethical Climax" is "awarded" to players who click the catnip-gathering button 2,500 consecutive times without 2.5 seconds ever passing between clicks — a feat only likely to happen if one is using an autoclicker.
    -   The "System Shock" achievement is awarded for trying (and failing) to sell an AI core during the AI apocalypse — it's not going to let you fix your mistake _that_ easily!

    MMORPGs 

-   _City of Heroes_:
    -   The game awards badges for some rather dubious "achievements", including sustaining high amounts of damage, paying off debt (which is accrued each time you are "killed"), and time spent held in status effects. At least most of the badges for such effects have cool names; taking a lot of damage gets you the Tough, Indestructible, and Unstoppable badges, which are at least okay. The final "Death" badge is _Exalted_. The cool titles alone (which could be worn and showed up under the player character's name) were reason enough for many players to work towards them. Also, for melee characters like Tanks and Brutes, the "damage taken" badges were, of course, treated as badges of honor.
    -   There's another badge, Virtual Victim, for dying in an Architect mission in test mode.
    -   The badge descriptions can turn to mockery even if the badge doesn't exactly deserve it; for instance, the Lambda Looter badge, for gathering all the temp powers in the Lambda Sector trial but using none of them, reminds the player that the temp powers can be used to make the fight against Marauder easier.
-   _Dragon Awaken_ includes the "Never Surrender" goal, which requires you to be killed 20 times by another player in one event called Battlegrounds. Completing the goal can help strengthen your character significantly, so many people do end up accomplishing this task eventually, whether by having another player agree to kill them or by spamming attacks at another player until they've been killed enough. Typically, if a player removes equipment, gear, and allied heroes, it makes it easier to achieve this goal. There is also another goal, called 'Stranger,' that requires you to get 'wrong' answers to 20 questions in the Soulmate mini-game with a partner. In this case, the answer counts as 'wrong' if you don't select the same answer as your partner.
-   _The Elder Scrolls Online_ contains an achievement for swimming out too far and being killed by the resulting slaughterfish.
-   _Guild Wars 2_: One world boss in the core game, the Shatterer, always arrives for his meta-event by landing on a specific spot on the map. The achievement for getting killed when the Shatterer lands on your head gives as many achievement points as killing the Shatterer 10 times, and Death is Cheap, which means it's common to see a bunch of people standing around at Ground Zero to collect that achievement.
-   _Kingdom of Loathing_:
    -   The game has a number of these for the masochistic to collect and proudly display, such as 'Brave Sir Robin', for fleeing from 100 battles, and 'The Ghoul Cup' for eating 11 nasty undead dishes that permanently reduce your stats.
    -   There is even one that you need to acquire by buying it: the "Mr. Exploiter" accessory, which can only be bought for a practically impossible amount of money.
-   In _Mabinogi_, there are several titles for embarrassing failures, such as "the Butterfingers"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , "is a friend of Ferghus"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and most notably "who was Defeated by a Fox at Age 17". Even with using Windmill to take out chunks of your HP, gaining the fox title takes a considerable amount of patience since you gain health passively very slowly, but still almost as fast as a fox can damage you.
-   _PlanetSide 2_'s Dasanfall leaderboards track every kill from every weapon from every player. Most players get around 1000 kills on a weapon before moving on. The "Industrial Agriculture" achievement is granted for getting _a hundred thousand kills_ on one weapon, with the quip:
-   In _RIFT_, killing innocent animals occasionally drops their tears as artifacts, with flavor text such as "So sad." and "You murderer." Not only is there a full set of these such artifacts, there is even an achievement for collecting 20 of a certain type.
-   _Star Wars: The Old Republic_:
    -   After players started jumping into a sarlacc on Tatooine to quick travel to the nearest regen point, the devs added the "Worm Food" title for doing so.
    -   There's an achievement for killing 100 Jawas on Tatooine while having the Party Jawa item (which has a Jawa suspended by balloons circle around the player while throwing confetti) active. It's called "That's Just Wrong!"
    -   There's an achievement for getting a turtle that wanders around the Rishi stronghold killed. The action for doing so is labeled "You Are a Horrible Person" and it unlocks the legacy title Horrible Person.
    -   The swoop event has an achievement for hitting all the obstacles in a single race for each track – basically impossible unless you're trying. Getting the achievements for all three tracks grants the Perfect Idiot achievement.
-   _Warhammer Online_ has a series of titles unlocked by failure, including dying via mobs up to a million times ("The Tragic"), being killed up to 100,000 times by enemy players ("The Feckless"), or falling to your death up to 5000 times ("The Pancake"). In addition to this, there are specific titles for being killed by each enemy class, drowning in lava, and several other dubious rewards that people nonetheless wear with pride.
-   _World of Warcraft_:
    -   An achievement "Stood in the Fire"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  required players to get killed by Deathwing when he strafed zones. It was actually harder than it sounds, given how random Deathwing's attacks were. Played even straighter after Deathwing became killable when the achievement was modified to include dying during either the Spine of Deathwing or Madness of Deathwing raid encounters. Not only does it retain its dubious value, but it now also signifies that it is likely the recipient's first time fighting Deathwing on that character.
    -   Several years and multiple expansions later, the dream lives on with "Still Standing in the Fire" for dying to the Dragonflight raid boss Fyrakk. It is accompanied by extended guttural laughter, voiced by Matthew Mercer!
    -   "It's A Trap" is an achievement given to players who walk across the obvious traps in a scenario.
    -   Some dubious achievements are gained on holidays. The "Disturbing the Peace" achievement is gained during Brewfest by getting completely drunk and dancing in the middle of Dalaran. During Children's Week, you get the "Home Alone" achievement for using your Hearthstone while with your charge, and the "Bad Example" achievement by scarfing down candy in front of him. "Out With It" is gained by eating candy during All Hallows' Eve until you puke.

    Platform Games 

-   _Achievement Unlocked_ is based all around this concept. The goal is to obtain all "achievements", which requires doing all sorts of strange actions.
-   The PS3 port of _Alex Kidd in Miracle World_ has a trophy for losing rock-paper-scissors even while using a Telepathy Ball, and a trophy for running out of lives in Janken's dungeon with less than $400. Both trophies are named "Shameful" and "Tears of Regret" respectively.
-   _Aritana and the Harpy's Feather_ has not one but six different achievements for getting hit or dying in different ways.
-   _Battleblock Theater_ has the "Consolation Prize" achievement, which is awarded for dying enough times.
-   _Cave Story+_ for Steam has an achievement for being killed by Toroko. As in, the harmless little Mimiga who "attacks" by running back and forth waving a stick, which only does 1 damage per hit, and you have to deliberately stand still and wait to die, if you have more than 1 HP. Even the achievement name ("Toroko Wins!") sounds surprised that it ever happened.
-   _Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy_ rewards several trophies for dying in various ways over the three games. Additionally, there are trophies in _Crash Bandicoot_ for spinning away an extra life and for missing over 40 crates, and one in _Cortex Strikes Back_ for completing several levels without collecting the Crystal.
-   _Cuphead_ gives you Selling Out for giving in to the Devil at the end of the game.
-   Roughly half of the 32 Steam achievements in _Eryi's Action_ involve the many distinct ways Eryi can die. And _then_ there are the achievements that involve actions that don't kill Eryi outright but instead impede her progress or make the level Unwinnable by Design, such as _destroying a goal flag_.
-   _A Hat in Time_:
    -   The "Why" achievement on PC is earned by typing something profane or lewd into Hat Kid's computer or responding to a CAW agent's question in a similar manner.
    -   The "False Detective" achievement is unlocked by completing "Murder on the Owl Express" without getting any clues. The achievement description contains the phrase "you suck" in brackets.
-   _JumpJet Rex_:
    -   Dying 500 times awards the player the achievement "JumpJet Rekt".
    -   Failing to escape the asteroid in time after planting the bomb earns the player the bad ending where Rex dies and the achievement "Rex In Peace".
-   The _La-Mulana_ remake has a number of Steam achievements for falling for certain traps, but of note is the "This is La-Mulana" series of achievements, three of which involve dying to particular instant-death traps and the last of which involves getting punched by a huge stone fist into a pit in the Hell Temple. None of the things that trigger these achievements are in the original version, just to rub it in for those who have played it.
-   In _Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris_, if you end a multiplayer game with the most deaths, you receive an achievement/trophy titled "At Least You're the Best at Something".
-   In _LittleBigPlanet 2_, there's a trophy called "1,440 Minutes of Create," which is earned by spending a total of 24 hours in Create Mode. The Vita version changes this to "Get a Life". In both of those games, there's also trophies for dying 20 times in one story level, and pins (in-game achievements) for things like dying a certain number of times, coming in last place in races, drowning, killing multiple Sackbots in the story levels, slapping other players to their deaths, or popping yourself to retry. "It's really not too bad..."
-   _Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2_ features an achievement for _Mega Man X6_ (a game known to be notoriously hard even by _Mega Man X_ standards) that requires Rookie Hunter Mode to be on<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and you earn it by falling into a pit. Even the _name_ of the achievement ("Wait, What!?") is mockery.
-   The PS3 port of _Monster World IV_ awards a trophy for jumping off the cliff at the start of the game.
-   _Nihilumbra_: There's an achievement for dying ten times in a row in any void mode level. You will probably earn this in level 1-1.
-   _Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!_ gives you the achievement "Oops..." for pulling a lever and dropping a Mudokon down a pit. The achievement description says "Fail to observe your surroundings", adding further mockery.
-   _Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero?_: The sequel has "Diaper Rash", a medal earned by clearing 22 stages in Baby Mode. What can add to the sting is that a bonus level is locked behind obtaining all in-game medals... assuming the player doesn't know the cheat code to simply unlock said stage early.
-   _Ratchet & Clank (2016)_ has an achievement for getting killed by a Pool Shark on Pokitaru.
-   Enrolling in Direct Dutposit in the very first level of the Rock Cavern will award an achievement called "Get Good" in the Steam version of _Rikki & Vikki_.
-   _SEUM: Speedrunners From Hell_:
    -   "RIP" achievement requires you to die 666 times.
    -   "100 ways to die" requires you to get killed by every type of trap in the game.
-   _Shovel Knight_: In _Plague of Shadows_, after beating the first two members of the Order of No Quarter, the return to Home Base has Plague Knight's assistant Mona dancing by herself while thinking she's alone. Sitting there and watching the entire dance, which goes on for almost 2 minutes, nets you the Feat "Creep".
-   _The Simpsons Game_ has a zero-point Achievement earned by dying ten or more times during the game.

    Puzzle Games 

-   _Catherine_ awards "Take Your Time" for moving a Dark Block (very heavy blocks that take quite a few seconds to move) ten times in a row. Note that every level in _Catherine_ is a Timed Mission, meaning this is usually a very bad idea.
-   Half of _Mine Sweeper_ achievements are for failing, including losing a game on the second click, or losing an expert game at the last possible click.
-   _Pixelo_: One badge is unlocked for clicking a wrong pixel, while another is unlocked for failing a puzzle. They give gold for doing these actions when equipped.
-   _Portal 2_ gives an achievement for falling for GLaDOS's trap... and another for falling for Wheatley's.
-   _The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition_ has "Ten Minutes Later...", awarded for waiting for ten (real) minutes after Guybrush gets thrown into the river.

    Racing Games 

-   All games based in the _Alarm für Cobra 11_ TV series has an achievement that requires you to wreck your car.
-   The thirteenth achievement in the first _American Racing_ requires you to spin off 5 times, which would require you to suck and effectively get pushed around by other cars.
-   _Assetto Corsa_ awards "Collateral Damage" the first time you blow your engine.
-   _F-Zero 99_: Several of the obtainable Badges are earned for Crashing Out a certain number of times.
-   In _Need for Speed: Carbon_, to unlock one of the parts, you have to earn the consolation award. You get that for losing. Another one of the parts requires an award where the player has to be arrested in career mode.
-   The _Pepega Edition_ from _Need for Speed: ProStreet_ has a one achievement named "Captain Slow" in which requires you to complete a race using the 1886 Mercedes-Benz Patent Motorwagen, a 19th century vintage carriage that only has 1HP with a max speed of 11 km/h making it one of the slowest vehicles in the entire racing video gaming that made debut and only in _Gran Turismo 4_.
-   _Wangan Midnight_:
    -   If you somehow time out the first stage of Story Mode (the timer is quite lenient and is only there as an Anti Idling and anti-hogging measure) rather than losing by way of having the opponent cross the finish line, you get the "Fight" title unlocked.
    -   From Stage 41 of Story Mode until the end of the current loop, losing a stage, if you have not done so yet, not only deprives you of "undefeated" rewards, but also unlocks the "First Black Mark" title.
    -   From the second loop onwards, each stage awards a unique title for winning the stage and another one for losing the stage as well. The title obtained depends on whether the loop is odd- or even-numbered.
    -   There are dozens of titles awarded for retiring in Time Attack in very specific locations.
    -   Crash your car too often during races and you'll unlock the title "Creak car".
-   _WipEout HD_ (PS3) and _Omega Collection_ (PS4) has a trophy for getting eliminated on Novice difficulty, i.e. getting your hovercar destroyed by an AI opponent.

    Rhythm Games 

-   The US PS2 version of _DanceDanceRevolution: DDRMAX_ unlocks the song "Celebrate" when you fail for the first time, and "Gentle Stress" when you fail an Oni course.
-   _Guitar Hero_:
    -   _Guitar Hero 3_ had an achievement for failing any song a total of ten times, and _Guitar Hero 5_ had another for failing after the 95% point on "Do You Feel Like We Do (Live)" by Peter Frampton.
    -   The X360 version of _Guitar Hero 2_ gives you an achievement for _your first failed song_.
-   The _Persona: Dancing_ spinoff games each have a trophy for failing a song.
-   In _WACCA_, clearing a chart with 1-5 misses awards the "Missless!" status. There is also a special icon of Elizabeth with her Face Framed in Shadow and looking pretty displeased if the player gets 1 Miss on a Hard or Expert chart that would've otherwise been an All Marvelous run.

    Roguelikes 

-   _The Binding of Isaac_ _Rebirth_:
    -   The Scissors are unlocked after dying 100 times. That said, unlocking (and picking up) The Scissors is required for Platinum God/Real Platinum God, so if you want that 100% Completion achievement, you'll have to get it at some point.
    -   Some of the Keeper's unlocks are this. Instead of unlocking new items, he gets his own starting items that make the game easier after you've already beaten some of the hardest bosses to get them. The biggest troll unlocks are Sticky Nickels, which permanently sometimes replaces coins with nickels you need a bomb to pick up, and beating Hush, which gives the Keeper **one penny** at the start of every future run. And yes, you'll need to do this for 100% completion. _Repentance_ changed the Hush unlock so that it also started Keeper with one extra health coin.
    -   In the Afterbirth+ DLC, Resetting 7 runs in a row also unlocks the Mr. Resetter achievement and Half-Soul Hearts.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  However, this can be advantageous as it gives hearts an increased chance to spawn as a soul heart variant rather than a red heart. Because of this, _Repentance_ changed the achievement to unlock scared hearts instead, which are red hearts that run away from you.
    -   Lil Spewer is unlocked by dying to your own explosive Ipecac shot. Again, picking up Lil Spewer is still needed for 100% completion.
-   _Brutal Orchestra_ has a few achievements for party members dying in specific ways, such as being killed by Trigger Fingers' Boom, Headshot!, dying to an ability from a party member (such as taking a Divine Protection hit), and having a party member die _twice_ to Heaven. Thankfully, these achievements unlock items for future runs.
-   _Crypt Of The Necrodancer_ has an achievement for being killed by a green slime. This is actually much harder than it sounds, because the only way for most enemies to hurt you is for them to move onto the spot you're currently occupying, and green slimes don't move at all, so you need to _really_ go out of your way to get the slime to attack you. You need to use Dove's flower to confuse the slime (which reverses all its movements) and then use a Scroll of Fear (which makes all enemies move away from you).
-   _Dead Cells_ sports achievements for:
    -   Getting killed by a falling elevator.
    -   Dying while carrying 100 or more Cells.
    -   Performing a downward smash onto some spikes.
    -   Actively choosing to explode the Mushroom Boi pet.
-   _Death Road to Canada_:
    -   Killing the Prime Minister not only nets a Non-Standard Game Over, you get an achievement for it. Nice one, hoser.
    -   There's a cheevo that requires you let the Anime Girl explode in the car. Her detonating inside the car is a bad thing, as it'll deal 2 damage (one lethal hit, one non-lethal hit) to everyone and damage the car. In a game where the average survivor typically starts with 3 HP, this will usually leave your characters on the brink of death.
-   _Luck be a Landlord_: Arrows increase the value of symbols they point towards. There are three achievements for having arrows that don't point to anything.

    Role-Playing Games 

-   _The Age of Decadence_ has an achievement for dying on the first combat encounter.
-   _Cris Tales_ has the "Technical problems" achievement. It's awarded for getting the party killed when one of your party members, JKR-721, overheats and suffers Explosive Overclocking. Thanks to HP to One attacks used by certain bosses, getting this achievement is easier than one would like.
-   _Darkest Dungeon_ has a few achievements for losing heroes under specific circumstances, to highlight its brutal and unfair nature:
    -   "The First of Many has Fallen...", awarded for the first hero that dies.
    -   "We all return to dust...", for losing a Level 6 hero, as a reminder that even being at max level will not guarantee your safety.
    -   "No Retreat, No Quarter...", for your first Total Party Kill, with its counterpart "More Blood Soaks the Soil...", for a Total Party Kill against a boss. "Valiant sacrifice..." is its next step up for a Total Party Kill in The Very Definitely Final Dungeon.
    -   "The Stresses were Unbearable...", for losing a hero to a heart attack, and often requires the hero to have endured an absurd amount of physical and mental punishment.
    -   "Gnawing hunger sets in...", "Blocked from life..." and "Watch your step...", for losing a hero to hunger, clearing an obstacle by hand, and trap damage. All three are environmental hazards and you typically need a hero on Death's Door outside combat (an already bad position to be in) to even stand a chance of earning that achievement.
    -   "We return to the worms of the earth...", for losing a hero to a laughably pathetic Maggot.
    -   "That'll do, Pig...", for losing a hero to Wilbur, the Swine King's assistant, whose only attacks are to instruct the Swine King to attack, and to squeal loudly (which does only one point of damage, but also stuns). This is not so unlikely, since the Swine King has probably put at least one of your heroes on Death's Door, and Wilbur _must_ be killed last or the boss will always use his strongest attack every turn.
-   _Dark Souls II_ has the achievement "This is _Dark Souls_", which unlocks the first time you die. There is no known player who does not have this achievement unlocked.
-   _Disco Elysium_ has some achievements like this.
    -   The crowner of mockery is "The Figurines Won't Win Her Back", with the description "They do nothing". To get this, you have to collect all the figurines hidden throughout the game, and then offer them to Dolores Dei, a.k.a. Dora, Harry's ex, when you meet her in a dream sequence. Like the name and description imply, you get absolutely nothing for doing this, not even a satisfying outcome. The whole sidequest seems designed to mock collectathon elements in games.
    -   "Baddest of the Bad Cops", for getting your Relationship Values with Kim to their lowest possible.
    -   Choose enough moralist/centrist options, and you get named "The World's Most Laughable Centrist".
-   _E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy_ has several achievements of dishonor; "Nuclear Man" for gibbing yourself with the Excidium cannon, "Low Tech Dummy" for being hacked by a _door_, "Doctor Hyde" for "accidentally" teamkilling an ally through medkit overdose, plus a variety of achievements for going insane.
-   The HD remake of _Fable_ has "I Did This For A Cheevo," which requires you to headshot a man standing on the Bowerstone Bridge while crossdressing. It's unlock text is simply "Congratulations. You look ridiculous."
-   In _Fallout 4_, the achievement "Touchdown!" is earned by being killed by a Super Mutant Suicider or a Mini Nuke launched with a Fat Man weapon.
-   In _Final Fantasy VIII_, there is a Steam achievement for losing a rare card in Triple Triad. Then again, you have to lose specific rare cards to the Queen of Cards to advance her sidequest, so completionists will have to get this sooner or later.
-   _Genshin Impact_ has some in-game Achievements like this.
    -   _"If you put your heart into it..."_ for cooking one suspicious-tasting dish, which requires failing the cooking minigame.
    -   _"...Anyone can be a gourmet."_ for cooking 10 suspicious-tasting dishes.
    -   _Boared to Death_, awarded for getting killed by a wild boar (which is not even technically an enemy, rather classified as hostile Wildlife).
    -   _"...Smells Like Asphalt."_, awarded for losing a party member to the dark mud within the Chasm’s Underground Mines.
    -   _Shocking... Positively Shocking_, given for getting struck down by Balethunder, a status encountered in Inazuma.
    -   _The Bleak Midwinter_, given for succumbing to Sheer Cold (a status effect in Dragonspine which causes your HP to steadily decrease unless you're near a source of heat).
    -   _The Hunter Becomes the Hunted_, for being defeated by The Great Snowboar King (a boss in Dragonspine).
    -   _Wrath of the Gods_, awarded for getting struck by lightning.
    -   _Penalty_, given for taking damage from digging a Pyro Slime out of the ground.
-   The updated version of _The Legend of Nayuta: Boundless Trails_ has the Spirit of Fortitude achievement, granted for falling 20 times.
-   _NieR: Automata_ has a few of them. The first is the "What Are You Doing?" achievement for looking up 2B's dress 10 times. Then there's "Not That I Mind...", which requires you to literally blow the pants off of 9S with a self-destruct attempt, and then spend an hour playing as pantsless 9S. The third is "The Circle of Death", which requires either you or another player to retrieve your dead body (which, obviously, requires you to die first). The fourth is more of a What the Hell, Player? achievement called "Wait! Don't Kill Me!" which requires you to kill 10 friendly machine lifeforms.
-   _Penny Arcade Adventures_ episode 2 has "Pervert", for inspecting a pair of binoceros testicles five times in a row, and "Reluctant Hero", for refusing to join Gabe and Tycho at the start of the game five times.
-   There are various badges in _Spore Creatures_ awarded for repeatedly doing incredibly stupid or illogical things. These include fleeing combat, taking damage from hazardous terrain, making yourself sick, dying, picking fights with friends, and flubbing saving Flubit.
-   It's possible to get some titles in _Tales of Symphonia_ after difficulty in battle. Some of these titles actually give decent stat boosts, especially for the stage where they can first be obtained, and are worth intentionally seeking out.
    -   Raine gets Never Say Never for dying five times in a single battle, and Survivor for being the last ally standing at the end of a battle.
    -   Presea earns Fragile Shield if her guard stance is broken by an enemy ten times in a single battle.
    -   Genis gets Study Harder! for using an elemental spell that the enemy is resistant to ten times in one battle.
    -   Colette earns Oblivious for entering a battle with her poisoned and finishing the battle without curing the poison, and Single-minded for only using one arte with Colette for the entire battle.
    -   Regal gets Pratfall King for being knocked down three times in one battle without recovering.
-   _Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE_ has achievements (well, "Play Records") for trying to buy a drink from a vending machine without enough money, walking 500 meters while a party member is poisoned or unconscious, and winning 20 consolation prizes in the lottery.
-   All of _Undertale_'s PlayStation-based achievements are taking the piss out of the achievement system as a whole. They're either for anticlimactic things (acquiring one, two, three, or four items); reaching new areas of the game, which is required by the story; or for entirely superfluous, waste-of-time events (donating various amounts of money to the Dog Shrine, one coin at a time). The platinum trophy at the end? "Don't You Have Anything Better to Do?". Doubles as a Writer Revolt, since the only reason any of these achievements exist is because Sony requires that all PlayStation games have achievements, whereas Toby didn't like the idea of forcing the player to do certain things.
-   _Vindictus_ has several titles, such as having one's equipment destroyed a certain number of times, and titles for picking up enough gold dropped from destroyed scenery. "Enabler" is acquired by completing a side-quest that involves bringing large amounts of booze to the town blacksmith, and the reward for spending several real-time hours fishing on Valentine's Day is "Master Baiter". Some of these require a huge number of occurrences to achieve the "highest" level of the title.
-   _Wasteland 2_ has the "What Does This Button Do?" achievement, which is awarded for accidentally setting off the dormant nuke in the Ranger headquarters and getting a Non-Standard Game Over.
-   _Wasteland 3_ gives you the "No-Show" achievement for dying in the prologue.
-   _Winter Voices_ has the "Like A Hen On A Wire" Steam achievement. To get it, you have to obtain the worst score in every major quest of the boat.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 1_ awards you for suffering a Total Party Kill, dying from Fall Damage, having a heart-to-heart go as badly as possible, missing attacks, and even winning a fight without actually doing anything.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles X_ has a few achievements for things like getting your first Total Party Kill (or getting fifty of them) or jumping into the game's only Bottomless Pit. Unfortunately, the game has a semi-multiplayer mode that is almost always on, and readily broadcasts your achievements for everyone to see. One particular achievement players usually saw several times a day was the one for the first time you get your Skell destroyed.

    Shoot 'em Ups 

-   _Aaero_ awards "No Points for You!" if you fail a stage.
-   _Battle Garegga Rev.2016_ has "Attempted Pink Flamingos" for getting a Game Over in Stage 2 before releasing the pink flamingos.
-   _BLUE REVOLVER_:
    -   If you restart Stage 1 three times in a row, you get the "The Perfectionist" achievement. Just to rub it in further, the icon is of the pause menu with the "Restart" command highlighted.
    -   If you put in a swear word as your initials, the game will forcibly change your initials to "B★R" and give you the "How Dare You" hidden achievement.
    -   Crashing into an item ship gets you the "Supplies Delivered" hidden achievement:
        
        "Collide with a resupply ship. How?"
        
-   _Mushihime-sama Futari_'s Xbox 360 port awards an achievement for losing your last life with the Stage 5 1-Ups visible on the screen.
-   _Raiden Fighters Aces_ awards a 0G secret achievement for dying 256 times.

    Simulation Games 

-   _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_ has Nook Miles rewards for being knocked out by a tarantula or scorpion and accidentally shooting down a balloon present over a body of water. The Miles they come with are just as good as any, though, and the descriptions on some of these read as Tom Nook trying to ease the pain of the player's mistake (and/or giving advice for the future).
-   In _APICO_, you can get an achievement for accidentally picking up a storage item with other items or liquids stored inside, dropping the former back into your inventory or spilling the latter all over and wasting them.
-   _Car Mechanic Simulator 2018_ has "Kinda naked" for a balance of $0.
-   _Chorus_ has "At Least You Tried" for dying in Permadeath mode; notably, there is no achievement for _beating the game_ in this mode.
-   _Cute Bite_: The Checklist for things to do, has, not winning, but "Lost at arcade games".
-   _Delicious 2 Deluxe_ has the "You Should Be Ashamed" achievement for letting 100 angry customers walk out the door.
-   _FreeSpace 2_ has "Congratulations, you have attained the rank of Admiral. _Now go read a book._" This is because attaining Admiral requires completing the single-player campaign roughly a hundred times. (The previous game in the series outright accuses you of cheating and urges you to stop.)
-   _HunieCam Studio_ awards the player an achievement for contracting all six STDs on a single save file. While this is technically a matter of luck, STDs can be prevented with the correct items, meaning that catching so many of them would be the result of extremely poor decision-making.
-   _My Summer Car_ has a plethora of Steam achievements that can be considered mockery:
    -   "An Idiot": You must break Teimo's Shop glass. Also the description says "An idiot is definition of you.".
    -   And it is gone!: Die with Permadeath mode active.
    -   Bad Guy: Get in a full jail sentence and survive without dying until you're free.
    -   Don't answer that call: As it says you should not ask the call during in an thunderstorm, but if you want to get that achievement, simply ignore the warning and it's yours.
    -   Engine started!: Attempting to play the Game Within a Game Conan McGuinness Global Rally Grand Prix 95 in the Mikropekka computer, the game within a game crashes or freezes depending the graphical settings of that game due to the Mikropekka computer having an inadequate hardware and insufficient RAM. Freezing the computer (not the real one you're using) awards you with that achievement.
    -   Finnish sisu!: You can obtain this achievement by finishing a rally with a missing wheel and its suspension.
    -   I am coward: Obtained by starting the game with permadeath off.
    -   Money well spent: Fail a car inspection.
    -   Pimped!: You must apply a pink plush dashboard cover to your Satsuma and it's yours.
    -   Smoking kills: Can be obtained by smoking while refueling which like in real life, it can be potentially dangerous so you will end up burned to death.
    -   Thank you government: Have a fine of 5,000 mk of the police.
    -   Too much power, too little skill: Get in a BMW 5 Series E34-esque looking car EDM 500LX (Kuski's car) and let him drive recklessly at the point of crashing to death.
    -   Total idiot & full idiot: You deserve this by giving Pena the finger while he's giving you a lift.
    -   Ultimate survivor: Drink your pee.
    -   What a shock!: Die by peeing on the TV, fuse table or the computer. The description says "Too long walk to the toilet perhaps?".
-   In _The Sims Medieval_, some achievements are ones that are not very good. A noteworthy one is "Have 25 people die in your Kingdom," which since the maximum population of hero Sims is only 12, 25 deaths have to come from either questing so badly you have to remake your heroes multiple times, or killing off a majority of your original NPC population, which weakens your kingdom.
-   In _Spore_:
    -   There's the "Joker" badge that you can earn if you enter a cheat code in the space stage. This badge prevents you from getting any further achievements. There's also a hidden "Pathological Cheater" achievement that you get upon cheating 50 times.
    -   The secret badge that you can get from allying with the Grox is called "Dance With The Devil", and getting it does not give you any badge points.
    -   If you get 30 of your pack members killed in the creature stage, you'll be awarded with the "General Custer" achievement.
    -   Should you die at least once in every stage of the game, you'll get the "Can't Win For Losing" achievement.
    -   There used to be a hidden "Bad Baby" achievement that you could get if a creation of yours was banned from Sporepedia, but it had to be removed because players were deliberately uploading offensive creations in order to get it.
-   _Surgeon Simulator 2013_:
    -   "What Have I Done??" requires you to lose your patient within 15 seconds.
    -   "Hammer Time" requires you to lose a total of 50,000ml of blood using the hammer.
    -   "It's In! It's In I Tell You!" requires you to lose the patient even though the replacement organ lands safely in its intended spot.
    -   "Enter The Code" is awarded for successfully typing in a code during the space surgery that opens up the door to outside, leading to a Non-Standard Game Over.
    -   "I Have No Idea What I'm Doing" requires you to quickly smash up all the canisters containing the replacement organs during the alien surgery.
-   _Viscera Cleanup Detail_ has an achievement awarded for getting fired, which requires you to leave the area you were supposed to clean up with an even _worse_ mess.
-   In _Warhawk_, the Play Station 3 version has several of the bronze trophies be awarded for such dubious feats as stepping on 5 land mines, or flying into your own aerial mine.

    Sports Games 

-   The Xbox 360 version of _2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa_ has a "Shameful" achievement for quitting out of an online match five times. It offers no points to your gamerscore and only exists as a badge of dishonor.

    Stealth-Based Games 

-   From _Deceit_, you have an achievement called MVP for earning the most XP of the whole lobby in a game (XP tracking how much you accomplish) and one called... LVP for doing the exact opposite. To top it all, the icon for LVP is a hand doing a L sign with the pointer and thumb.
-   If you lose ten times in a standard _Devilish Hairdresser_ game, you get the "Angel Wannabe" award, mocking you for failing to mess with the Angelic Hairdresser.
-   In _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_, the Snake Beater achievement is a 10G achievement for Snake getting caught, uhm, stimulating himself.
-   _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_ has:
    -   "You enjoy all the killing, that's why." for killing so many enemies in one area that Snake vomits.
    -   "Handle with Caution" for breaking off a statue's penis.
    -   "You're pretty good." for getting kissed by Ocelot during the final battle, which happens if you don't press any buttons for a while during what appears to be a Press X to Not Die situation.
-   _Octodad_:
    -   "Trim Your Moustache" requires you to get sucked into the riding mower. Normally, the lawn mower section occurs immediately after you attach the fallen birdhouse onto its hook, after which your arm gets glued to it and you can't let go. But if you _throw_ the birdhouse onto the hook, then you can enjoy getting yourself a Non-Standard Game Over.
    -   "Number 100 Dad" requires you to die more than 100 times in a playthrough.

    Strategy Games 

-   _Advance Wars: Dual Strike_: While not officially achievements, the game has several medals to earn by completing various milestones, such as building/destroying a certain number of each type of unit, capturing a certain number of properties, and so on. Two of these milestones are to earn a specific number of D Ranks and E Ranks in missions. In a strange twist, it can actually be harder to earn these ranks than even an S Rank, since normally if you're doing poorly enough to earn a D or an E, you're probably not far off from failing the map outright. Most people achieve these two medals simply by screwing around on the first mission.
-   _Age of Empires II_ and its expansions have Steam achievements...including achievements for _losing_ certain amounts of units, buildings and games.
-   _Civilization V_: Some achievements are less than complimentary, including "He threw a car at my head!" for having to buy back one of your cities from barbarian conquerors.
-   _Crusader Kings II_:
    -   "Keeping It in the Family": Sire an Inbred child
    -   "One Is Not Amused": Have a discontented council (_Conclave_ DLC)
    -   "An Honest Mistake": While secluded, kick someone out who did not have bubonic plague (_The Reaper's Due_ DLC)
    -   "Scarrrrrred for Life": Become one-eyed, one-legged, and one-handed (_TRD_)
    -   "Aptly Named": Die of the bubonic plague (_TRD_)
-   _Hearts of Iron_:
    -   "The weapons of the Third Emu War" requires you to develop a nuclear bomb as Australia and use it to bomb your own territory.
    -   "Panda-monium" is awarded to the player for playing as any Chinese warlord state and going to war with every other Chinese warlord state (simultaneously.)
    -   "You Will Never Kill Me Alive" requires the player to order one of their spies to take a cyanide pill after getting captured.
-   _2nd Original Generations_ has a trophy titled "King of Being Shot Down" (roughly translated from Japanese) if you lose five of your mechs in a single stage.
-   _Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis_ has a few unflattering medals with penalty effects:
    -   _Bogus Hero_, if you gain 20 or more levels while sparring your own units.
    -   _Don Quixote_, if you attack someone and the counterattack damage deals 2/3 of your max health.
    -   Clerics and Priests can earn a third one, _Gibe of the Fallen Angel_, by killing three enemies with physical attacks.
-   _Total War: Shogun 2_ includes an achievement for sinking or capturing a particularly powerful ship. Possibly due to a programming oversight, you still get this achievement if it's _you_ that loses the ship in question.

    Survival Horror 

-   In _Alien: Isolation_, you get an achievement for dying to the Alien 100 times, called "100 Times Too Many".
-   _Dead Rising 2: Off The Record_ has an achievement for receiving your first medal (out of many you can earn in sandbox mode). The flavor text reads: "It says 'Participant' in tiny letters on the bottom..."
-   _Lust for Darkness_ has a sequence when the Apocalypse Cult which serves as the antagonists has an orgy in their manor; there's an achievement for looking at the orgy for 10 minutes. Since the part of the plot when the orgy takes place is very short, linear, features no exploration at all, and ends after activating the only interactable item in the level, getting the achievement means the player spent 10 minutes staring at animated NPCs doing dirty stuff (completing the level normally is much, much faster than 10 minutes). There's also three separate achievements earned by dying during the game (one for being caught by the cultists, one for dying inside the Lusst'ghaa dimension, and one for wearing the mask long enough to become insane).
-   _House of Ashes_ has "Six Minutes Of Night", wherein you have everyone survive the game just to be killed in the last few minutes of the story.
-   The HD remaster of _Resident Evil 4_ has "Don't Shoot The Water", awarded for provoking Del Lago into swallowing Leon whole, which is done by shooting into the lake.
-   The HD Remaster for _Resident Evil (Remake)_ has "Get Used To It", gotten by dying for the first time.
-   The _Five Nights at Freddy's_ games have a few of these:
    -   From _Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator_, the bankrupt ending, requiring you to run out of cash:
        
        _"You gave it your best shot. You went all in. You put all your eggs in one basket, and did the unthinkable: you ran out of cash. While we encourage entrepreneurs to follow their dreams, we also recognize a lost cause when we see one. There are no do-overs, and we trust that you know your way out. But before you go, take this Certificate of Bankruptcy. Now do everyone a favor, and get lost."_
        
    -   From the same game is the mediocrity certificate, which requires you to buy/salvage absolutely nothing:
        
        _"Congratulations! You've completed a full week on the job, and you've done it in such a lackluster way that no one is proud or disappointed. It's a fine line to walk, but you did it, completing your job with such an efficient level of laziness that we're surprised you're able to dress yourself in the morning. While such a minimalist work ethic is rare, it doesn't mean that we want you back. In fact, it means you should look for employment elsewhere. But before you go, take this Certificate of Mediocrity. You should be proud. You stood on two feet, and convinced someone that you could do something, when in fact you couldn't. Now get out."_
        
    -   As a general example, every game with an achievement system has an achievement which requires you to get Jumpscared, and these have the lowest Xbox score across the board, with _Five Nights at Freddy's 2's_ "You Failed" achievement having a paltry _15_ points, with the second lowest, "One Night at Freddy's" having 60 points.
-   _Tormented Souls_ has the achievement simply called "Death", where you walk into a unlit area and get attacked by...something
-   _Yomawari: Lost in the Dark_: The "Indomitable" achievement requires you to die 30 times.

    Third-Person Shooters 

-   _Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard_, as an Affectionate Parody of games in general, also takes the piss out of achievements. You get achievements for starting the game, watching the credits, and pausing, and there's even a few achievements for features that _aren't in the game_, such as an interrogation minigame and multiplayer. Matt just throws them at you at arbitrary points of the campaign.
-   _Kid Icarus: Uprising_ will reward you with achievements for:
    -   Being turned into an eggplant. This and the one below can be awarded to you in multiplayer provided that player has already "achieved" the status;
    -   Being turned into a tempura, and then being turned into a tempura five times. Be it by enemies or other players going out of their way to humiliate you;
    -   Being "finished" (the game's equivalent of a Game Over) a certain amount of times.
-   Dying on the lowest difficulty in _50 Cent: Blood on the Sand_ unlocks the "Not Bulletproof" achievement. Appropriately, it is worth zero Gamerscore on the Xbox 360 version.

    Turn-Based Tactical 

-   _Gears Tactics_ has "I Just Shot Marvin in the Face" for downing your own teammates.

    Visual Novel 

-   In _Coffee Talk_, there are achievements for messing up your order once and throwing away 25 drinks.
-   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy_ has two notable ones: "Please Turn In Your Badge" for answering "Mia Fey" (your mentor) when asked who the defendant is in the first case, and "Justice Ill Served" for getting the bad ending in _Justice For All_.

    Wide Open Sandbox 

-   In _Bully_, if you fail three class minigames in a row you unlock a Dunce Cap as a wearable item.
-   In _Grand Theft Auto III_ in the Definitive Edition versions there's a Social Club achievement called, Am Walkin' Here in which can be obtained by getting killed by being run over.
-   _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_: The Play Station 3, Xbox 360 and Xbox One versions as well as the Definitive Edition the achievement/trophy "Horror of the Santa Maria" can be unlocked by being drown.
-   _Grand Theft Auto V_ cheerfully awards an achievement for being eaten by a shark.
-   Similarly, _Mafia III_ has an achievement for being eaten by an alligator.
-   _Minecraft_: There are two categories of Achievement System for the game; "Advancements", which are built into the game engine, and then system-supported achievements for the Xbox and PlayStation versions.
    -   "When Pigs Fly", an achievement for riding a pig while it takes fall damage. Since most animals try to avoid cliffs, this requires the player to direct the mount with a carrot on a stick.
    -   "Serious Dedication", an advancement involving hoes (the tool); the advancement has been altered as of the update that introduced Netherite, but both versions qualify.
        -   Original: building a diamond hoe, diamonds themselves being a limited resource and adding nothing to the tool besides durability, and wearing down all of its 1562 uses until it breaks. The in-game description for this version of the advancement is 'Completely use up a diamond hoe, and then reevaluate your life choices.'
        -   New version: Building a diamond hoe, diamonds themselves being a limited resource and adding nothing to the tool besides durability. Then collecting enough Ancient Debris (which is substantially rarer than diamond, and can only be found in the Nether) to make a netherite ingot, which can be used to upgrade any diamond item. Then, using that ingot to upgrade your diamond hoe into a netherite hoe - which, again, adds nothing to the tool besides durability. The in-game description for this version of the advancement is 'Use a Netherite Ingot to upgrade a hoe, and then reevaluate your life choices.'
-   _Saints Row IV_ has a scene where Zinyak asks you to surrender and be executed, and promises that if you do so he'll set everyone else free. Doing so will get you a Non Standard Game Over and the "You Chose... Poorly" achievement.
-   _Marvel's Spider-Man 2_: Trying to perform an aerial trick too long results in Spider-Man face-planting into the ground and gets you the trophy "Splat!"
-   _The Stanley Parable_: Multiple:
    -   There's an achievement for attempting to jump, titled "You Can't Jump".
    -   There's also "Click On Door 430 Five Times", which is meant to parody meaningless achievements. If you try to do exactly what the achievement says, the Narrator will express his disbelief about you being awarded an achievement for something so simple, and thus he'll send you all over the place doing all sorts of odd tasks in order to have you "work" for your achievement.
    -   Finally you can receive the achievement "Go Outside" for _not playing_ the game for _five years straight._ The earliest date you could possibly achieve this without cheating is October 17th, 2018. The Updated Re-release ups the ante by upping the amount of time to ten straight years. The earliest date to achieve that one without cheating is April 27th, 2032.
    -   The demo also features a fake achievement (fake as in it produces a real Steam achievement popup but it automatically revokes itself once it's been earned so as to not show up in your profile, and can be re-earned every time you play) called "Video Games!!" for dropping a cup in a trashcan.
-   _Superman Returns_ awards the "Not that Super" achievement in the Xbox 360 version for entering a cheat during the game. It's worth zero gamerscore, and includes a picture of Supes wagging his finger disappointingly at you.
-   _Terraria_ has achievements like "Watch Your Step!", which is awarded for dying to one of the traps that are randomly generated underground, and "Dead Men Tell No Tales", which is awarded for getting killed trying to open a booby-trapped "Dead Man's Chest".

    -   Suffering a Total Party Kill fifty times.
    -   Dying of fall damage.
    -   Missing 100 attacks.
    -   Winning a battle without actually doing anything, because you had the AI members of your party fight for you.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles X_ awards the player an achievement for:
    -   Suffering a Total Party Kill for the first time.
    -   Suffering a Total Party Kill fifty times.
    -   Getting your Skell destroyed for the first time (you'll see this one a lot, due to the game announcing every achievement that a player on your server gets).
    -   Running out of Skell fuel. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Falling into a Bottomless Pit.
    -   Falling into a bottomless pit one hundred times.
    -   Failing an online mission.

    Other 

-   Many arcade games, particularly Shoot 'em Ups, will award the player exactly 1 point for using a continue (sometimes also zeroing out the upper digits) up to a maximum of 9 times while everything else is scored in multiples of 10. This makes the last digit of the player's score reveal how many times they continued.
-   The Xbox 360's Achievement System assigns achievements an arbitrary point value, which is tallied as a "gamerscore" on the user's profile. A few games took advantage of this to create mocking "negative achivements" worth _zero_ points.
-   _Brawl Royale_: Among the _Epic Battle Fantasy Collection_ version's 13 medals is "Masochist", earned by being killed by every in-game opponent in a single sitting.
-   _Capcom Arcade Stadium_ and its _2nd_ version: For each compilation, getting a Game Over in any game unlocks an achievement.
    
    **Triumph completed!**: First Failure.
    
-   Every installment from _Kuukiyomi_ has an achievement list also known as "Hidden List". Most achievements require you to do something (ridiculously) inconsiderate/incorrect. For example: "A Single Bite" achievement from _Kuukiyomi 2: Consider It More! - New Era_ is acquired by eating the whole cake piece instead of doing as C-Ko (the player protagonist's girlfriend) says: take a single bite of it.
-   The mobile phone Virtual Paper Doll game _Love Nikki - Dress Up Queen_ has "Momo's Nightmare" achievements, obtained by failing styling contest stages.
-   The chess app _Play Magnus_ has some less-than-flattering achievements:
    -   "I Pity the Fool": Lose through a Fool's Mate. Even beginners almost always manage to avoid it.
    -   "The Last Straw": Be checkmated despite having a large material advantage.
    -   "Murphy's Law": Be checkmated by Magnus at 5 years. He's programmed to play random legal moves, so if you lose to him and didn't do it on purpose, it's pretty embarrassing.
    -   "The Weakest Link": Be checkmated in 100 games.
-   On Stack Overflow, a badge named "Tumbleweed" used to be awarded for asking questions that get no response from the community. The badge was retired in 2019, as it was found too discouraging.
-   _World of Warships_ has the "Detonation" achievement. To obtain this you have to be unlucky enough to be struck in the ship's magazines and fail an RNG roll, which instantaneously obliterates you regardless of how much health you have left. As a crowning irony, you are then awarded ten signal flags which, when fitted to your ship, _specifically prevent detonation_.

### **Examples from other mediums:**

    Pinball 

-   _James Bond 007 (Stern)_: If a player who's logged into Stern Insider Connected lights an outlane ball saver and then loses their last ball without using it, they receive the achievement "Improper Drain Usage."

    In-Universe Examples 

Anime & Manga

-   In _Double Homework_, when Dr. Mosely visits the protagonist, who has done nothing for months except play video games at home, she flat-out says that nothing in a video game is _really_ an achievement.

Western Animation

-   _Futurama_, "Game of Tones": Fry fails a video game and is greeted with "the sound the game makes when you get the all-time lowest score".
-   _South Park_, "Guitar Queer-O": Stan and Kyle succeed at reaching one million points in _Guitar Hero_ and they are congratulated... by being called fags by the game itself.
