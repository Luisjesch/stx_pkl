Rescue Arcs are common in fiction, usually involving The Hero, or The Protagonist, charging in to save their captured comrade. Though the hostage can just as easily be a loved one, some snot-nosed kid, or worst of all, The Load. The success of the rescue attempt mainly depends on the setting and type of story we're dealing with.

But this instance is a special case: because the hostage doesn't need saving. In fact, those guys that're on their way are the ones that're gonna need help... just as soon as our "hostage" finishes picking the lock to their holding cell and mops the floor with their guards, who're probably just as stunned as the audience is at that moment.

After all, that's not how television works. Hostages aren't supposed to save themselves; much less the people trying to save them!

In cases like these, the character in question is likely to be a super spy, an Action Girl, a Guile Hero, or similar character type. While villainous examples will include The Dragon, Classy Cat-Burglar, or more likely, the Loveable Rogue, who's dashing, daring, and infuriatingly clever. Whoever they may be, they're perfectly capable of getting themselves out of a bind, given the right opportunity. And they'll usually meet up with their would-be rescuers in time for some witty banter about "what took them so long?", after saving their bacon.

This may result in a Redundant Rescue, since the hostage was never really in danger and may have been Captured on Purpose, as part of a ploy to infiltrate their captor's lair. It's also possible that the captive tricked the villain into letting him go. Regardless how it plays out, the bottom line is: they don't need help (any more), but now the would-be rescuers _do_.

When implemented, it can be the reason for an Unwanted Rescue. Or, it can lead to complaining about the rescue attempt, now that they have to deal with the unwanted complication of saving their friends, while still trying to get the job done.

This may overlap with Badass in Distress, or Damsel out of Distress. Compare with The Cavalry Arrives Late, if the captive has not only freed themselves, but defeated the villain (and their henchmen) as well. Also compare Now, Let Me Carry You.
