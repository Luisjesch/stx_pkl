**Scott:** Give us our clothes back, damn it!  
**Other Wormers:** Please?!  
**Tina:** Nice undies!

_How_ distressing: Having taken a brief moment to unwind, the hero, their friends, their lover(s) or some combination thereof decided to go Skinny Dipping. And, wouldn't ya know it, someone took off with their threads!

Various Naked People Are Funny antics ensue as they try to obtain new clothing (or improvise covering with leaves or other items) before the characters' nakedness is exposed to all the world. Usually results in Naked People Trapped Outside. The clothes thieves' motivation varies. The thief may be playing a prank; they may be poor and want the clothes; they may want the clothes for a disguise; or they may wish to see the swimmers in a state of undress. A variant is to have the clothes not be stolen per se, but rather blown away in the wind or a similar scenario.

This can also be played from the opposite perspective, where the main characters set out to steal other people's clothes in this manner. In either case, the thievery almost always works.

Note that in kid-friendly works, the victim will usually be left in a swimsuit or underwear.

Related to Outdoor Bath Peeping and Slippery Swimsuit. Can either be used for comedy or, most often if the character is female, for some Fanservice.

Granted, her rage is understandable since she's stuck on Earth until she gets it back. The actual truth is an aversion, though ultimately tragic for both the goddess and the guy.

When Vegeta returns to Bulma after a long period of training, she complains about the smell of sweat and bullies him into taking a shower, during which time she takes his soiled armor and replaces it with some tacky clothes, including a pink shirt with the words "BAD MAN" on the back.

    Fairy Tales

-   In _Shin Megami Tensei II_, if you avoid the lawful part you have to steal a bathing Fury's robe, since wearing it will mask your alignment and allow you to pass the Cherubs guarding the entrance to Eden.

As Mongreltown has shades of being a Wretched Hive, the apathetic staff take no responsibility for the missing (though admittedly patchwork and valueless) clothing and won't even leave him the dignity of his loaned Modesty Towel, forcing him to walk the streets with only his diary for cover for a bit.

    Real Life 

-   There is a popular (and likely apocryphal) story that America's first female reporter, Anne Royall, came across John Quincy Adams while he was skinny-dipping in the Potomac River and sat on his clothes until he agreed to an interview.
    -   There was another story in which said president had his clothes stolen while he was skinny-dipping and he had to ask a passerby to run to the White House and bring him back another outfit.
    -   Note that nobody disputes that Adams skinny-dipped in the Potomac; this is well known to have been part of his routine. What's in dispute is the clothes being stolen part.
-   Thieves were a big problem at the Roman baths for exactly this reason. Not because the Romans were as paranoid about nudity as we are, but because clothes were a _lot more expensive_ back then. Even a simple laborer's tunic cost a decent amount, and the gods help any Roman who hadn't been able to ditch his toga at home before heading to the baths.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  At least many baths offered to sell cheap robes (at ridiculously inflated prices) to bathers whose clothes were stolen. (And perhaps not surprisingly, many of those baths also had thieves on their payroll....)
-   Before George Washington was ever a president, a revolutionary, or even a lieutenant in the French and Indian War, there is a record of a court proceeding against a girl who stole his clothing (or at least his belongings) while he was swimming on a trip.
-   There is a story in _America's Dumbest Criminals_ of a businesswoman who, after a long summer drive, decided to skinny-dip in a river to cool off. While swimming some men arrived at the river and blocked the route to her clothes. Too embarrassed to head for said clothes, she jumped in her car, sped home, and was pulled over by an officer who was shortly quite embarrassed himself.
-   In World War 2, an officer of the 509th Composite Group on Tinian Island (the group who flew the atomic bombing missions) and his nurse girlfriend went skinny dipping and found their clothes stolen when they got out, forcing them to walk a mile back to the main base, in the nude. It was assumed that a mischievous Japanese soldier had stolen the clothes, but in his 2012 memoir _My True Course_, Theodore Van Kirk of the _Enola Gay_ revealed that he had been the one who stole them.
-   A 1922 news article: FARMER ENDS 'BATH' PARTY AT MIDNIGHT: Likes Nature, But Prefers to Sleep; Clothing of 40 is Confiscated.
-   This happened to the Alternative for Germany (AfD) co-leader Alexander Gauland while he was bathing in a lake.
