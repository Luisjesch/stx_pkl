_"Your Highness, if you believe me to be your enemy, command me, and I will gladly take my life."_

Alice did something terrible to Bob. Whether it was a mistake, an act that she had no way to prevent or something she did before a Heel–Face Turn, she regrets it now. Very much.

So she meets Bob, confesses her guilt, and offers up her life. This can take one of two flavors:

1.  Alice believes she deserves death, and it seems appropriate to her that Bob should be the one to kill her.
2.  Alice believes she deserves punishment, and it seems appropriate to her to let Bob decide what the punishment should be, up to and including death.

Similar but distinct from several tropes, as follows. If Alice wants to _live_ so she can work for the good, she's The Atoner. If she trusts Bob not to kill her but nonetheless sets up a situation that would allow her to do so, it's Kill Me Now, or Forever Stay Your Hand. If she indeed wants to die but would rather die fighting, she's a Death Seeker; if she's incapable of killing herself and wants someone she trusts to do it, it's I Cannot Self-Terminate. If she is a villain trying to invoke If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him!, it's Strike Me Down with All of Your Hatred!, and if she doesn't believe Bob will be able to do it, it's You Wouldn't Shoot Me.

It's rare for this to actually result in Alice's death. Heroic characters will be just too forgiving or pacifistic, while less upstanding characters are likely to respond with "You're Not Worth Killing" or "You deserve a long life alone with your guilt". The exception is when Bob considers it a Mercy Kill to take Alice's life, which is more likely when Bob has Death Seeker tendencies himself.

Also compare Redemption Equals Death. A nonlethal variant combines Hit Me, Dammit! (for the character inviting the attack) and My Fist Forgives You (for the attacker).

The first few times, he's angry about his defeat and defiant; while Lazlo can instead offer to let him join the resistance movement, he rejects that. Only after he's been fully broken and realized that his good intentions didn't make him the good guy that he's fully willing to submit to Lazlo's judgment... and, potentially, to his forgiveness.
    -   In _Suikoden V_, Nakula is searching for the Nether Gate agent who assassinated his father. Upon finding the most likely culprit (who freely admits that they don't even remember if they're the one who took out this particular target or not), they've become a Stepford Smiler Death Seeker and offer this to him. (Nakula decides to hold off on determining whether or not he'll take that offer until after the Godwins are dealt with.)

This is partly because Clan Mei was responsible for Hikari's mother's death, since Mugen pressured Jin Mei into hiring some bandits to kill both Kura and Hikari. However, it's also because Rai Mei fears that Mugen will wipe out Clan Mei for her failure, and she thinks that her death will reduce the likelihood of that happening.
-   _Persona 3_: Shinjiro (who is slowly dying anyway) offers to let Ken kill him in order to avenge his Accidental Murder of Ken's mother, though he does so with a warning.

-   Magus of _Chrono Trigger_ lets the party have a rematch to the death if they feel like punishing him for his misdeeds despite knowing he is but a Well-Intentioned Extremist and is not to blame for unleashing Lavos and indirectly causing Crono's death. As he has been defeated once already, it's abundantly clear he doesn't expect to win. If you do spare him, he offers to atone for what he DID commit (such as the Mystic War in 600 AD) by becoming a Sixth Ranger in your group.
-   Near the end of _Dragon Age II_, party member Anders, a Well-Intentioned Extremist, has just blown up the Chantry with innocent clergy inside (and possibly tricked Player Character Hawke into helping). He surrenders to Hawke without a fight and says "If I pay with my life, then I pay." You are given the choice of killing him as he asks, kicking him out of the party, or keeping him around, though he will be surprised if you spare his life and fellow party member Sebastian, who was a Chantry brother, will leave in a rage.
-   In _Sengoku Basara 3_, when Mitsunari discovers that his Number Two Yoshitsugu betrayed their ally Motochika, he claims that he's also at fault for remaining ignorant and asks Motochika to take revenge on him. Motochika refuses, telling Mitsunari that he should live on and repent.

-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   _Fire Emblem: Awakening_: When Lucina remembers that the Avatar is the one who will kill her father Chrom in the Bad Future, she promptly tries to kill them to stop it from happening even when she's not exactly happy about that; the player has a choice whether or not to accept Lucina's judgment, but either way, Lucina is stopped by Chrom himself, who asserts that he trusts the Avatar completely.
        -   Alternatively, if the Male Avatar is Lucina's husband, or if the Female Avatar is her mother, whether or not they accept, they refuse to fight back and reassure Lucina that they love her no matter what; in response, Lucina breaks down and can't bring herself to go through with it.
    -   _Fire Emblem Fates_:
        
        -   In Chapter 5, Azura does this to the Avatar after their Traumatic Superpower Awakening, as part of an elaborate attempt to bring them back to their senses.
        
        **Azura**: Kill me if you want, but... do it as yourself.
        
        -   Oboro and Beruka's supports in the _Revelation_ path are about this trope. Beruka's adoptive father and mentor is the one who murdered Oboro's parents, but Beruka has already killed him. So once she finds out, she tells Oboro to kill her... but Oboro realises that she's just stretching the Cycle of Revenge, and refuses to do so.
    -   Exaggerated in _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_ with Constance, whose mood changes from haughty and exuberent to morbid and self-deprecating when in the daylight.

        _"If I have displeased you, please take my life as a small gesture of atonement."_

-   _Heart of the Swarm_: When Kerrigan shows up to rescue Raynor, she's been reverted to Queen of Blades form (when last he'd seen her, she'd been deinfested). When he calls her out on it, she takes his gun hand and holds it to her head, flinching when he fires... into the wall behind her. He comes around after he sees that she's willing to let Valerian evacuate as many civilians as he can before the Swarm attacks.
-   In _Hotline Miami_, this is how Richter, the man who was forced to kill Jacket's girlfriend, responds when Jacket comes for him. The player is free to spare him or kill him, and befitting the game's themes of futility, it doesn't really matter which they choose. Canonically, he was spared.
-   When Lloyd in _Front Mission_ meets Maury and learns how her hometown was burned down during the war, he tells her that he was involved in the Larcus Incident that triggered the conflict and that she's free to kill him if she wishes.

-   Played for Laughs in _Fallout: New Vegas_ in regards to Yes Man, the AI responsible for planning the events that led to your character being shot in the head in the beginning of the game. Since he's programmed to be a submissive bootlicker, he tells you that you're free to try and kill him but since he's an AI he'll simply upload himself to another Securitron and thus apologizes for the fact that you'll never truly get vengeance.
-   _Tales of Arise_: Dohalim says this twice. The first time is to Kisara after her brother Migal sacrifices himself to reveal that hundreds of thousands of Dahnans were killed behind Dohalim’s back. The second time is to his friend Fahria, whose fiancé, Tarnigen, he accidentally killed during the Crown Contest to become lord.

-   Occurs a couple of times in _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_:
    -   The first time, after the Ouroboros had liberated Colony 4 from its Flame Clock, Jeremy confronted Mio and Sena about the friends he had lost fighting against Agnian forces (though they themselves were not actually part of the specific Agnian colony in question). Mio offered her life for his satisfaction, but he relented after seeing from the marking on her neck that she only had a few months left to live anyway.
    -   Later, when the Ouroboros were pursued by Colony Lambda, Commander Isurd goes on a rant about how he had recreated the circumstances by which Taion had originally been forced to escape and leave Nimue behind to die, as an act of revenge against him. Taion offered his life to Isurd as compensation, though this didn't take as the Isurd before them was revealed to have been one of Consul J's mudpuppets.

-   At the conclusion of _Zero Time Dilemma_, the mastermind, Zero II / Delta, has managed to flawlessly pull off his plan of...ensuring the birth of himself and his twin sister, and giving the players the knowledge necessary to avert a nuclear war. Several of the players aren't exactly satisfied with the actions Zero took in order to achieve his goals (in particular, releasing the Radical-6 virus which killed _six billion people_ in another timeline, setting up the events of _Virtue's Last Reward_); however, Delta points out that he can't be arrested for any of his actions, since they happened in alternate timelines (in this timeline, all he did was briefly imprison the players, flip a coin and release them unharmed) and all the evidence of any deathtraps he had set up has already been disposed of. As a sort of compromise, he tosses Carlos a gun and declares this the final Decision Game: Carlos can either shoot Delta or allow him to walk away, depending on whether he believes Delta's actions were justified. The game ends before we see what he decides.

    -   In an arguably even more disturbing scene, it's heavily implied that Equius consciously allowed Gamzee to strangle him to death purely because, due to the trolls' caste system, he believed it was the latter's inherent right to do so.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: Mammon asks this of anyone who can get through the obstacles to reach his lair, figuring that anyone brave or foolish enough to make the trek inside must have a bone to pick with him anyway. He does it to Allison when he notes she has her sword drawn.
    
    **Mammon:** Oh! Ah. Hmmm. You thought to slay me? Well, go on then, give it your best. I'm just too damn big for that sort of thing now. Many have tried, certainly. _Go on._ I deserve it, I know. My brothers...
