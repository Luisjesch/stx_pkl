On the left: medical assistance. On the right: booze.

In the 11th century AD, the Christian archdeacon (and later saint) Bernard of Menthon founded a monastery/hostel/hospice high in the Swiss Alps, along one of the major mountain passes used by pilgrims traveling to Rome. The monks looked after travelers seeking to cross the pass into Italy and rescued any who got into trouble. Sometime in the late 1600s, the monks acquired a number of dogs, and eventually began using them in rescue work. These rescue dogs were bred into a mastiff-type dog which was large, friendly, intelligent, and uniquely colored. These eventually became known as "Saint Bernard's dogs", or more simply "St. Bernards."

Unfortunately, fact became mixed with legend, as it often does, and as a result St. Bernard dogs are often depicted in media as carrying small barrels of brandy (or, in more kid-friendly media, hot chocolate) around their necks. Supposedly, the brandy would be used to warm rescued victims from the cold. The monks of the Saint Bernard Hospice deny that this was ever used in Real Life, and say instead that the idea came from an early painting of a St. Bernard dog.

The idea that the dogs could do this, or that a drink could even save someone from hypothermia was examined and busted by the _MythBusters_. Alcohol would, in fact, _endanger_ their lives because the warming effect is caused by increasing heat flow to the extremities, which would lower the core body temperature and accelerate the onset of hypothermia, though if rescue was imminent it _might_ have the benefit of delaying frostbite. (That said, dogs are often trained to be able to sniff and dig out people trapped by natural or man-made disasters. The _handlers_ of the dogs often carried brandy to try to warm up the people the dogs dug up before getting them to safety, which is probably how the myth got started.)

A common gag in cartoons, especially Warner Bros. and MGM cartoons, involves the dogs actually taking swigs of the brandy for themselves or the brandy making the survivors drunk.

    Western Animation 

-   There's at least one Bugs Bunny cartoon with the Saint Bernard — but instead of sharing his brandy with others, he drinks it himself and shows up drunk at his rescues.
    -   In the short "Piker's Peak," the barrel contains a minibar. The dog uses the contents to mix himself a martini.
    -   In _Cracked Ice_ (Tashlin, 1937), a St. Bernard uses his wares to assist an ice skater who had fallen through the ice. W.C. Squeals (a pig avatar of W.C. Fields) sees it and first feigns drowning to obtain some of the dog's booze. Failing that, he schemes to steal the flask around the dog's neck.
-   In the _Tom and Jerry_ episode "The A-Tom-Inable Snowman," each time Tom suffers an accident the Saint Bernard helps him... almost all of the time making him drunk.

-   _The Fairly OddParents!_ Christmas Episode has one of these saving Timmy's Bumbling Dad from a snow-in. The barrel around its neck contains eggnog, conveniently allowing the writers to skirt the depiction of booze in a kid's show.
-   _Popeye_: One short features a Saint Bernard rescuing Popeye. Upon recognizing him from the comics, the dog gives him spinach instead of brandy.

    Real Life 

-   You can buy the kegs for your Saint Bernard pet, though it's not recommended you have liquid in them for hygiene reasons due to the dog's tendency to slobber. If you do, alcohol is actually a good choice due to its antiseptic qualities.
-   It's not unheard of for rescue animals to be sent out carrying flasks or barrels... of _water_, not brandy. While bringing booze to an avalanche victim is counterproductive as detailed above, bringing water can help the victim stay hydrated in the event they can't be immediately reached for whatever reason.
-   Brandy aside, St. Bernard dogs actually do have a history of real-life rescues. The breed originated at the Great Saint Bernard Hospice in the Swiss Alps. (In this context, "hospice" is a sort of monastery that provides travelers with a place to stay.) Originally they were breeding guard dogs but later switched to focusing on mountain rescues, as the Alps were very snowy and hazardous and people could easily find themselves in need of rescue. (Also this was the 1700s, so it's not as if anybody had snowmobiles.) The dogs were thus bred to be strong enough to get through snow drifts and to have a keen enough sense of smell to find people in need. The most famous of these dogs was named Barry, who reportedly saved between 40 and 100 people in the course of his career. One book from 1823 claims that Barry always carried a "little phial" which contained "a reviving liquor for the distressed travellers whom he found among the mountains". (Note that the word "liquor" is used to mean "an alcoholic drink" mostly in the U.S., but the author of this book was British. The "liquor" he mentioned was probably nonalcoholic. Barry's preserved body in the Berne Natural History Museum has what definitely looks like a brandy cask, but it's a 1923 addition.) However, the modern Saint Bernard dog is far larger than the Saint Bernards that performed alpine rescues (around the size of a German Shepherd) - a large amount of avalanches in 1816-1818 killed many of them while they were performing rescues which led the monks at the Great St Bernard Hospice to crossbreed them with Newfoundland dogs to keep the breed alive. This cost them their usefulness at mountain rescue since their now-heavy fur would get frozen and weigh them down.
-   First aid dogs were used in both World Wars to find injured soldiers in No Mans Land. Some of the dogs carried a backpack of first aid supplies that the wounded soldier could use to treat themselves until the stretcher bearers could get to him.
