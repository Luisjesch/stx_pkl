Don't you just hate when your friends make plans and leave you hanging?

**Kate McCallister:** Did I turn off the coffee?  
**Peter McCallister:** No... I did.  
**Kate:** Did you lock up?  
**Peter:** Yeah.  
**Kate:** Did we set the timers on the lights?  
**Peter:** Yeah.  
**Kate:** Did you close the garage?  
**Peter:** That's it. I forgot to close the garage, that's it.  
**Kate:** ...No, that's not it.  
**Peter:** Well, what else could we be forgetting?  
_\[Kate sits back, pausing, before suddenly jumping upright\]_  
**Kate:** KEVIN!

So the adventure's over, the team beat the enemy or found the treasure and got out alive, and it's finally time to relax, say their goodbyes, and head home. And someone says, "I've got this nagging feeling that there's Something We Forgot."

Cut to a major MacGuffin that got left in the dungeon. Or an ally who got trapped and is still waiting for them to get back. Etc. An Oh, Crap! is likely to occur by the character having this realization. Another stock version of this is a parent or guardian—inattentive or overworked at best or neglectful at worst—having forgotten to pick their child up from school, a sports game, a club activity, or similar.

Related to Brick Joke and Locked Up and Left Behind. Often deployed as The Stinger. Contrast What Happened to the Mouse?, in which a dropped plot element does not get another mention, and Offscreen Inertia, when the audience is left to assume that whatever was forgotten will stay in that state permanently.

After Akechi solves the case, he takes off for the night, while Inspector Kenmochi goes with a couple of other officers to celebrate the solving of another crime. Kenmochi has a brief recollection about forgetting something, but ultimately just shrugs it off. Miyuki, meanwhile, was Out of Focus, thinking that Kindaichi stood her up on their date, and goes out on her own, not knowing what actually happened. The last scene of the episode has Kindaichi apparently alone in jail shouting for his innocence, even solving the crime himself (having come to the same conclusion as Akechi did).

    -   Another chapter had Ayane tied up by her sister Machi as a quick gag. By the time Machi _finally_ gets back to her, Ayane had already untied herself, although she was also cleaning up some sort of mess (implied to be a Potty Failure).

    -   During a race in the Sun and Moon series, the normally athletic Kiawe falls behind the rest of the pack because part of the race involves pulling a wagon (with their Pokémon as passengers) uphill, and his partner is the very large turtle-dragon Turtonator.

They manage to get him as the two run off.
-   In the _Tenchi Universe_ episode, "No Need for Runaways!", after the gang got back Kiyone's stolen spaceship and successfully escaped from the Galaxy Police, Tenchi realized that they forgot to pick up Ayeka and Sasami, who were left at the diner, washing dishes to pay for their dinner.

        **Marge:** Homer, Did you remember to lock the front door of the house?  
        **Homer:** D'oh!  
        _(screen shows "Wednesday")_  
        **Homer:** Well, it's been two long trips, but we're finally almost there again.  
        **Marge:** When you locked the front door, did you remember to lock the back door?  
        **Homer:** D'oh! D'oh!  
        _(screen shows "Thursday")_  
        _(the family sits in complete apathetic silence)_  
        **Lisa:** Oh no, we left Grandpa back at the gas station!  
        _(more silence, Homer keeps driving)_  
        **Lisa:** ...what about Grandpa?
        
        -   Later, when Homer recreates the "Here's Johnny!" scene, he discovers Grandpa somehow made it to the hotel.
    -   This is something of a Running Gag for Milhouse — the first time was in "The Otto Show" when Homer and Bart left him buried under a pile of chairs after a Spinal Tap concert.
    -   And again in "Waverly Hills 9-0-2-1-D'oh", when Bart and Lisa attend the school in Waverly Hills for a short period of time. Bart suddenly remembers at the end that he has to go back because he was playing hide and seek with Milhouse. Cut to a view of the garbage can next to the Kwik-E-Mart with Milhouse's voice saying, "Two weeks! This has gotta be a record!'
    -   It happened again with Grandpa in "Fear of Flying": when the family returns home after Marge's panic attack on the plane, Bart mentions "You know, I have this feeling that we forgot something...". Cut to Grandpa still on the plane screaming _Home Alone_ style. We cut back to Homer who says "Eh, I'm sure it's nothing."
    -   Another Grandpa example was in "Cape Feare", when the Simpsons go into Witness Protection, leaving him locked out of the house. "Hello? Hellooo? ...I'm cold, and there are wolves after me!" _\[wolf howls\]_
    -   Also shows up in "The PTA Disbands", where the teachers go on strike. Everyone rushes out of the school so fast a little girl is left stranded on the rings in the gymnasium. "Hello? Mrs. Pommelhorst? I'd like to get down now..."
    -   As well as "Whacking Day", where Principal Skinner locks Bart, Jimbo, Kearney, Dolph and Nelson in the school's basement. Bart manages to escape, which sets the rest of the plot into motion. At the end of the episode, Skinner finally remembers that the others are still locked in the basement.
    -   In the episode "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)", Homer is inspired by a _Zorro_ movie to go around getting whatever he wants from people by slapping people with a glove and challenging them to duels. Much to his surprise, a Southern colonel accepts and he and his wife move into to the Simpsons' doorstep with his RV. He and the rest of the family flee the city and move into Grandpa's old farm, setting the plot into motion. After the climax of the episode, they move back to their house, with Homer saying "I don't even remember why we left." Of course, the colonel is still there waiting for him. The duel takes place, the colonel shoots Homer in the arm (which doesn't cause any significant damage), and the episode ends.
    -   "Mommy Beerest" ends with Homer having followed Marge and Moe to Aruba. It's only when they get settled in for the night that Marge remembers the kids, who have somehow joined a hot air balloon race in Paris in the meantime.
-   _South Park_: "Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo" has Cartman, Stan, and Kyle at the end of the episode commenting that they can't help but feel there was something they forgot. The "something" happens to be the fact that Kenny is still alive by the end of the episode.
    -   Played with example: In the episode "Cow Days", Officer Barbrady forgets to release the falsely imprisoned couple, who starves to death and rots in jail. The Mayor encourages him to forget the whole thing ever happened.
    -   In "Spontaneous Combustion" after doing a performance of the Stations of the Cross with Cartman playing the role of Jesus, Stan and Kyle then take him up to the hill and crucify him for real. They do this with the intention of having him die and have a resurrection, which Kyle intends to give to his father.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  It's only near the episode's end when they remember that they haven't taken him down and three weeks have gone by. To their amazement, Cartman is still alive, having lived on all the fat stored up in his body, he's now down to skin and bones, and he's really pissed off at them.
-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_:
    -   Played for Laughs in "School Spirit": At the end, while the school is cheering Star and Marco, Star gets the weird feeling that she's forgetting something. Then a flying monster that wasn't defeated swoops down and snatches Marco away.
        
        **Star:** That was it...
        
    -   Played for Drama in the episode "Storm the Castle". At the end of the episode, Glossaryck remarks that he hopes they found all the pieces of Star's old wand. Cue a final, ominous shot of the missing half of the star-shaped gem. Said item naturally becomes a key part of the show's Myth Arc in the following season.
    -   Played for Drama again in "Mama Star." When creating portals to Mewni isn't working, Star, Marco, Tom, and Janna find a way to get there through the Realm of Magic, which comes with the side effect of losing their memories. They ride in a car, and forget how to take off their seatbelts. Star, Marco, and Janna manage to, but Tom doesn't, and the others leave him behind and forget him. At the end of the episode, the Firstborn sends Star, Marco, and Janna to different parts of Mewni, and it's likely that they assumed she sent him away as well, so it's a surprise when Star and Marco return in "Cleaved" to find that he's still there, and has not only become completely mindless but is also being controlled by the evil unicorn. Thankfully Marco manages to restore his mind with pudding.
-   _Steven Universe_: In "Tiger Millionaire", Steven gets stuck in place when goo covering him hardens before he can wash it off. Amethyst and Pearl have an argument, which Garnet more or less takes Pearl's side on, then they all storm off, leaving Steven there until late in the night.
-   _Tiny Toon Adventures_:
    -   At the end of "Who Bopped Bugs Bunny?", after saving Bugs from a revenge-driven Sappy Stanley, Buster and Babs wonder if they forgot something on their way back to Acme Acres. It turns out that they forgot to release Daffy, Plucky, and Hamton from jail (the former for Bugs's kidnapping, which he did not commit, and the latter two for trying to break the former out).
    -   Averted in "Buster's Directorial Debut" where Sandy Witch feeds Babs a spiked carrot, turning her into a normal rabbit. Buster managed to fight off Sandy and escape with transformed Babs in tow. He decides that restoring Babs' original form can wait until he finishes his film project, leading to an unrelated plot where he deals with Plucky, who was being a prima donna over Buster's film. The episode ends with the typical closing camera iris, then transformed Babs hops in. Buster also comes in and uses Sandy's magic powder to revert her back to normal.
-   _Total Drama_: Happens a few times, all related to challenges.
    -   In what could've been a Deadly Prank, Gwen is challenged with being buried alive for five minutes in "Phobia Factor". There is enough air for an hour and Trent appoints himself as her watcher. Knowing full well that Trent is the only one keeping an eye on Gwen, Chris unleashes Trent's biggest fear on him. Then Chris himself forgets, leaving Trent with a sense of unease until he recalls Gwen's predicament well after the five minutes.
    -   In "If You Can't Take the Heat...", the Screaming Gophers trick Heather into the freezer and lock her up in there because she's bossing them around, and not in a way that'll make them win the cooking challenge. It's only after the challenge is over that Lindsay remembers to free Heather, who at this point is showing early signs of hypothermia.
    -   In "Ocean's Eight - Or Nine", a member of each team is kidnapped and locked up in a vault with tools to rob a bank. The first challenge is to get the teammate and tools out for the next two challenges. The Screaming Gaffers soon realize the first challenge takes them too long, they're still mad at Leshawna, and Duncan has ideas of his own on how to rob a bank. So they leave Leshawna right where she is. By the end of the day, the Screaming Gaffers, Chris, and Chef have yet to remember to free a stressed-out Leshawna.
    -   After getting the clue from the rack challenge in "I See London...", Noah and Owen are in such good spirits that they run off and forget that Tyler is still bound on the torture device. They realize their error before leaving the Tower of London, but upon their return the Ripper has already taken Tyler with him.
    -   Following the finale in "Lies, Cries and One Big Prize", Chris, Shawn, Jasmine, and Sky leave Pahkitew Island by helicopter without a care, though Chris does think they're forgetting something. That something is Dave, who is left alone on the island and is about to be mauled by a robotic bear.
-   Used in an episode of _The Venture Brothers_ - they forgot to free a bunch of supporting characters from a dungeon.
    -   Happens in "Escape to the House of Mummies Part 2" as well. Dr. Venture is the only one small enough to escape and get help, but he gets caught up in a contest with Orpheus and completely forgets about his family who escape on their own and have an offscreen adventure of which were only given glimpses into.
-   The "What If...Zombies" episode of _What If…? (2021)_ started the same way _Avengers: Infinity War_ did, with Bruce Banner crash-landing on the Sanctum Sanctorum of Doctor Strange. What diverges from the film is that, before he could warn his fellow heroes of Thanos' impending arrival, Bruce finds the Earth ravaged by zombies. Bruce completely forgets about the cosmic threat and never got to tell his fellow survivors before seemingly sacrificing himself. At the end of the episode, the remaining survivors fly to Wakanda, unaware that Thanos (also now a zombie) awaits them there...
-   _Work It Out Wombats!_: A recurring theme in "Campout Confusion" is that the characters keep forgetting things they need for the campout, such as marshmallows, a flashlight, etc.
-   During the "Humanity" episode of _Young Justice (2010)_, the team (plus tagalong Zatanna) go behind their supervisors' backs (Zatarra, Black Canary and Captain Marvel) to rescue Red Tornado.

At the end of the episode Captain Marvel makes it back to headquarters completely exhausted from babysitting a genetically-enhanced animal, still Locked Out of the Loop and still waiting for the team.

    Real Life 

-   In her autobiography, Yvonne Craig mentions the time she was left bound and gagged in a chair while filming the Man From U.N.C.L.E. episode The Brain Killer Affair.
-   POWs that continue to be held long after a conflict ends — for example, Americans who continued to be held in Vietnam, or even North Korea — are a grim real-life example. One could also say the same of the children of local women impregnated by soldiers of occupying armies during wartime.
-   When Julius Caesar marched on Rome on his return from the Gallic wars, Pompey's government fled into exile — leaving the entire contents of the national treasury behind them. D'oh!
-   David Bowie once gave a live stage performance, at the end of which, during his final number, he was picked up, in his chair, by a "cherry Picker" and swung out over the audience; at the end of the number, the lights went out, with Bowie still in mid-air, as the audience got up and went home; the theatre crew locked up and went out to a bar; it was only after several drinks that they realised that Bowie was still in the theatre, in his chair, at the end of the cherry picker arm, fifty-plus feet above the floor of the auditorium; "Were you going to leave me up here all night, you bastards?" was his first question as they frantically returned to the theatre.
-   Similarily to the above example, one scene in the _Doctor Who_\-episode "Mark of the Rani" required Colin Baker (who played the Doctor) to be tied to a large pole for a Tribal Carry in the middle of a forest. However, because Baker wore a support harness, untying him every time they reset the stage proved too time-consuming, so the crew just laid him down on the forest floor between takes. When it started to rain, the crew packed up and left to film a different scene in another location...only to realize after half an hour that they'd left Baker behind in the forest, still tied to the pole!
-   Apparently, My Chemical Romance has occasionally left their guitarist Ray Toro at truck stops while on tour.
    
    **Ray:** And the band's kinda driven a couple miles down the road, and I'd have to call them on my cellphone and it's like, "hey...what's up?" And they're like, "hey, how's it going man?" I'm like, "...you notice something's missing from the van?" And they kinda look around and go, "ahh, shit."
    
-   In _Empire of Dreams: The Making of the Star Wars Saga_, Kenny Baker recounted that, while filming, the cast and crew would on rare occasions forget he was inside the R2-D2 outfit (which could not be taken apart from the inside) and leave to take their lunch breaks. But, he said, someone would usually remember he was in there and come back to let him out.
-   Every summer, babies and pets get rescued from the backseats of hot cars because their caregivers forgot they were there. Such rescues aren't always on time.
