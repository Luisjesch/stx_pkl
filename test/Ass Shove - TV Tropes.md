A demonstration of _both_ versions of the trope.

_"Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years."_

Quite simply, this trope covers the act of putting something into or pulling something out of a character's rectum — or, alternatively, merely implying the act. Usually, this is done for comedy.

A variation of this trope is to give a character a rectal examination, an enema, a rectal laxative, or some other similar medical procedure, whereupon hilarity ensues. Often, just having the character bend over while the physician or Battleaxe Nurse snaps on a rubber glove is enough to play the joke.

In Science Fiction and Alien Abduction stories, this is usually an Anal Probing.

Sometimes paired with All Gays are Promiscuous, to demonstrate that gays chase anyone.

Also see Trouser Space, Bowel-Breaking Bricks, Orifice Invasion, Suppository Gag, and Thermometer Gag. Nose Shove can be a variation used in child-friendly works. See Mister Seahorse and Homosexual Reproduction for when the ass in question belongs to a male and the object in question is an infant.

Truth in Television, but such things are almost never as funny or as safe as they are in fiction; the rectal walls are surprisingly fragile and can be easily ruptured if a foreign object is recklessly inserted. Indeed, a number of people who got a little _too_ experimental with their exhaust pipes have suffered serious blood loss and even death from accidentally tearing these walls open. For these reasons, Don't Try This at Home.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Subtrope of Joke of the Butt. Not to be confused with Ass Pull, which is when a plot device or explanation seems so poorly contrived as to have a rectal genesis (_although sometimes both happen to walk hand-in-hand — or rather, dance cheek-to-cheek_). Nor to be confused with Ass Kicks You, when using one's backside as an actual weapon. Or with the saying "Shove it up your ass!"

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest_: When faced with a dragon attack, after getting the dragon onto the ground, Hajime rams a sizable pile bunker up the dragon's ass, revealing the dragon to be female, then tortures her by repeatedly hitting and twisting it. This awakens the dragon's masochistic side, and after he pulls it out, she gets an orgasm, then takes her human form as Tio Clarce and begs him to be her master and punish her some more.
-   _Are You Lost?_: Homare and Shion are stranded in the middle of the ocean with no drinkable water. To stave off dehydration, they are forced to give each other enemas with the sea water so that their anuses can absorb the water and not the salt.
-   _Attack on Titan_:
    -   Team Dad Reiner claims this is the other way to kill a Titan. That some of his comrades think he's serious makes it funny during an otherwise bleak situation. It gets arguably funnier when you realize that Reiner himself is a Titan.
    -   Another soldier, trying to get a Titan's attention, threatens this (the Titan's expression when it turns on him would almost suggest that it even understood).
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: When Reo goes to fight a kappa, she uses its habit of Anal Probing humans to take their _shirikodama_ against it with a fake covered in anti-ayakashi poison. A bonus comic even shows her head poking out of a bush when she's preparing herself.
-   In _Boku no Sexual Harassment_, a guy first gets _the contents of a bourbon bottle_ poured up his anus and then has _a whole corncob_ shoved up it as punishment for being a rapist. More specifically, for forcing Mochizuki aka the uke of the series to be his Sex Slave. _Mochizuki_ is the one who, with the help of the seme Honma, came up with this "revenge". The corncob part has reached massive levels of infamy among anime fans, specially after being featured in _AMV Hell_.
-   _Cross Ange_:
    -   This happens to main heroine Ange in the first episode. She's imprisoned in a dungeon, where she's forcibly bent over and manacled to a table. She's then given a rectal cavity search so vicious that it leaves her lying in a pool of blood.
    -   Later, Ange attempts to escape captivity after having been stripped naked. She retrieves a case holding her ring and hides it either up her ass or her vagina.
-   _A Cruel God Reigns_ plays the trope straight in a horrifying way when Greg uses the wooden Easter egg Valentine gave Jeremy on the latter before raping him.
-   _Date A Live_: Origami Tobiichi, because of her obsession with and desire to seduce him, once tried to get Shido Itsuka to take her temperature by sticking the thermometer up her butt, but he refused.
-   During Ninja Murasaki's fight with Goku in _Dragon Ball_, Murasaki jumps into the air and Goku positions his magic pole in such a way that when Murasaki lands, it ends up lodged up his ass. To make it even more painful, he accidentally jerks it around when he hits against a tree and Goku yanks it right out when he wants it back.
    
    **Goku:** Ahahahahahaha! Now you have a tail! Just like mine!
    
-   In Episode 26 of _Excel♡Saga_, the doctor shoves a gigantic syringe up Hyatt's butt.
-   In _Fairy Tail_, after every Bar Brawl, Max gets knocked out with a broomstick up his ass.
-   In the first chapter of _Finder Series_, Asami punishes Akihito for trailing him by shoving a film roll _up there_.
-   _Frame Arms Girls_: In episode 9, the FA Girls gather materials to try to cure Ao's illness, but end up bringing lots of useless items including live chickens, potted cacti, and a hard drive with an antivirus software installed. Ao appreciates the Materia Twins bringing a negi because it's something she could cook into a stew... until it turns out they want to shove it up her ass as per a traditional folk remedy.
-   Envy of _Fullmetal Alchemist_ gets kancho'd in a big way. His reaction is so very outraged by it.
-   In _Gamaran_, there's Kashitarou, a genius teen studying both anatomy and martial arts, who also happens to be a pervert with the recurring fantasy of sticking apples or tangerines up women's asses. He offers to do this twice to the same girl, and both times he gets beaten for his trouble.
-   In the _Ginga Densetsu Weed_ manga, a running gag has Sasuke shoving either a long pole or his paws into GB's butt during comic relief moments.
-   _Gintama_ loves this, with Hattori and Kondo being the most frequent victims of it. They aren't always so fortunate as to be wearing pants or underwear when it happens, either.
    -   Kondo willingly subjects himself to it on one occasion when Otae suggests the aforementioned "Spring onion up the butt" remedy for his influenza. Having him do it outside while naked (in the _dead of winter_), standing on one leg and posing with two other onions was something she added in just because she knows how willing he is humiliating himself at her demand.
    -   Doman gets subjected to this from Gintoki, who hits him with a kancho multiple times while Gedomaru bends him over, and was also given the same treatment from Seimei in the past (which is a joke on the fact that his family name of Shirino literally means "butt").
    -   Gintoki spends the majority of the Excalibur arc with Kusanagi using his butt as a makeshift scabbard since he feels insecure without one. Unfortunately for Gintoki, the sword is able to resist being removed by force, even when Kagura attempts to do so with a truck and a length of rope.
-   _Girl Friends (2006)_ combines this, Trouser Space, and Victoria's Secret Compartment in the third omake. First, a tiny Akko hides between Mari's breasts, but the train is so crowded that she is getting crushed. Where she moves next is heavily implied.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_:
    -   Onizuka hides a Treasure Map up his ass for a while before realizing what it is.
    -   The class (specifically Urumi) punishes him for trying to use them as a free work force by forcing him to wear an S&M outfit. The whip naturally goes up his ass.
-   _Gyo_ plays this trope straight in the least comedic and most horrifying way possible with the victims of an airborne plague which are strapped to mechanical walkers. The disease produces gas within the infectees that is used to power the machines carrying them, which siphon the gas out with tubes going both into their mouths and literally up their asses. This is not immediately clear with the sea creatures that initially caught (or were caught _by_) the disease, but it most definitely _is_ with later instances of infected humans.
-   _HEYBOT!_ has Awesome Fine Screw show he's the savior by defeating a Turtle Burger this way...with his screw head, visibly in the anus, making the Turtle Burger blush.
-   _Hybrid × Heart Magias Academy Ataraxia_: When Hayuru Himekawa cosplays as a Cat Girl, it is revealed her tail is attached to a line of anal beads that are stuck up her butt. Inserting or pulling it makes her orgasm. She develops a fetish for anal sex.
-   _Himouto! Umaru-chan_: In one chapter, Taihei catches a cold from Umaru, who goes to the store to get several gross/unpleasant home remedies for him as revenge for him not pampering her when she was sick, including a leek to shove up his butt. When she gets back home and sees how much Taihei is suffering, she feels guilty and instead tries to nurse him back to health, with an Imagine Spot where she defeats the cold germs (which look like Umaru) with the leek.
-   _How Clumsy you are, Miss Ueno_: This is Ueno's fate with a small, suspiciously shaped invention of hers, when she slips and falls down, causing her to painfully land her butt on the object. She tries to hide her accident from the unknowing Tanaka (in a squeaky voice), before Yamashita looks up Ueno's skirt and determines it only got stuck in her panties.
-   _Is This A Zombie?_ has a Running Gag of Ayumu getting something (usually a bamboo shaft) rammed up his ass. He actually orgasms from it.
-   In one of the _Kämpfer_ OAV's, Shizuku de-brainwashes Mikoto via pulling one of these on her. It's done Thousand Years of Death style... With a cover of the Ode to Joy as backing music...
-   _Kill la Kill_ has Sanageyama finishing off Takarada by shoving his bamboo sword up his opponent's ass violently and repeatedly.
-   Non-comic example: it's said explicitly that Munakata of _Medaka Box_ probably has around thirty-something or _more_ swords shoved in there. Yowza.
-   In an early chapter of _Moyashimon_, Tadayasu discovers one of the downsides of going to an agricultural school when he gets volunteered to give a cow a rectal examination. He just stands there with a horrified look on his face, one (thankfully gloved) arm up to the elbow in a cow's butt.
-   In a _My-HiME_ sound drama between Episodes 9 and 10, when Natsuki gets sick and her fever rises despite efforts to reduce it, the group turns to a folk cure which involves shoving a spring onion up the sick person's ass, much to Natsuki's horror and Shizuru's pleasure.
-   In _My-Otome_, the same trick is used when Aoi becomes ill, although Arika initially hangs the leek around her neck. Shizuru, when she comes in, proposes the ass-shove method.
-   Akira Shiodome from _Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea_ is very, _very_ fond of kancho-ing people, and he hilariously demonstrates it on his own aunt Chisaki much to the exasperation of his mother Akari.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Kakashi has his infamous scene with an unorthodox _jutsu_ called _Sennen Goroshi_ ("One Thousand Years of Death"), where he _shoved his fingers up Naruto's ass-crack_, and sent him _flying_. This is based on a real-life prank called _Kancho_. Naruto nearly gets revenge on Kakashi for this during _Shippuden_'s third episode, but a terrified Kakashi managed to dodge it.
    -   Naruto used it himself on Ebisu to check if the man was really unconscious or just pretending. As he didn't react, Naruto concluded he was unconscious.
    -   Naruto used it himself against Gaara. With a kunai. One of the summoned toads thinks it's absurd that Naruto wasted his time giving the giant sand monster "an enema"... and then the kunai explodes. Ouch.
    -   Lampshaded by Tenten, in the fourth chapter of the spin-off _Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth_.
        
        **Tenten:** It's just a KANCHO!!!!
        
    -   Apparently Kakashi's father used the same technique.
    -   For more on the real-life version, check the earlier articles on _Gaijin Smash_. Warning: may result in an Archive Binge.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_:
    -   A Running Gag in is Chizuru's attempts to test out a folk remedy for fevers, which involves shoving a spring onion up the sick person's ass (as if having a fever wasn't bad enough already). Kotaro and Natsumi are understandably terrified of her. Doubles as a Stealth Pun since a spring onion in Japanese is "Negi".
    -   It's no longer just a gag: Chizuru does it for real with her artifact (yes, a leek) in chapter 348! And to poor Negi himself!
    -   Ako's Artifact is a Giant Medical Syringe (the needle alone is noted to be 1.8 cm wide) that can bestow effects like boosting her allies' abilities or messing with an enemy's sense of direction. It has to be injected through the butt.
-   The male characters, such as the Sextuplets and Iyami, of _Osomatsu-san_ can be a victim to having _flag poles_ shoved up their asses.
-   _One-Punch Man_: Puri-Puri Prisoner is revealed to keep his cell phone up his ass. Which actually makes sense, as his fighting style consists of his muscles ripping his clothes to shreds before beating the crap out of the enemy.
-   In _Ox Tales_, Cecil the Skunk becomes a bit of a problem, so Ollie corks him.
-   In _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_, Brief accidentally swallows Panty and Stocking while they were shrunken. After a while, the two are near the end of his digestive tract but get stuck. Garterbelt straps Brief down and shoves his hand up Brief's butt to retrieve them, despite Brief's horror and protests. Afterward, Brief is incredibly miserable and sore.
-   A skit in episode 1 of _Please Tell Me! Galko-chan_ discusses this. Galko even mentioned when she was in elementary school, a boy attempted to do this on her and broke his finger in the process. According to chapter 20, that boy is Charao.
-   In _Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl_, Croagunk has taken up Misty and Max's role as the one to take Brock away from girls (before he makes a _complete_ fool of himself), by using Poison Jab, paralyzing him. It's almost _always_ depicted as Brock being stabbed in the _ass_. It's still better than the alternative, where Croagunk cockblocks him.
-   _Pokémon Adventures_. A girl in Fortree is busy getting her Zigzagoon out of a tree when the branch breaks and sends them both on a messy fall—or it would have been if Sapphire didn't jump down (from a higher altitude, no less) and catch the branch with her bare hands, occupants and all. The girl notes that her Zigzagoon isn't feeling too well and needs to get it to a Pokémon Center; Sapphire saves her the trouble, produces a berry, and feeds it to the Pokémon, curing it of its affliction. Where this trope comes in is how she came to this conclusion—she _sticks her nose up its butt!_
-   Kiyoshi from _Prison School_ gets a stiletto heel and later on part of a tree branch lodged on his anus. Despite bleeding profusely from his butt in both cases he takes his injury surprisingly well.
-   Another not-comedic example in _Sakura Gari_: one of Katsuragi's torture methods against Masataka included him forcibly shoving a household object up the guy's anus _right after having raped him_.
-   _Seitokai Yakuindomo_:
    -   It was briefly mentioned in that at a time Yokoshima was a student in the Ousai Academy, the aforementioned kancho was a common prank.
    -   What was in Aria's mind when the topic of "temperature tolerance" included, among others, a large enema syringe, implying she would do this... should Shino didn't clarify what was in the latter's mind.
-   One time, _Sgt. Frog_ is forced to study overnight, and assorted devices are used to keep him awake. One splashes water into his face. Another drops a tin bath on his head. A third one involves a massive _Kancho_ prop made of plastic and mounted under his chair... with a pretty powerful spring.
-   _Seven Mortal Sins_: When Lucifer gets hospitalized, her enemy Belial disguises herself as a nurse and subjects Lucifer to a humiliating and extremely painful suppository.
-   _Slam Dunk_: Hanamichi Sakuragi does it to Ryonan's coach, Taoka. Let's remember that Sakuragi is extremely strong, almost superhumanly so, and that he doesn't know what "holding back" means. The mere memory causes poor Taoka to jump from his seat and grab his ass... several weeks _afterward_.
-   _Super Radical Gag Family_: Minor recurring character Shonji Anagawa is very passionate with the kancho, striking his victims with his "44 Kancho" which he coined. It's an addition which this series run on toilet humor.
-   In a deleted scene from the Hot Springs Episode of _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_, Kamina attempts to look into the lady side of the bathhouse through the impossibly tall wall that separates both sides. While he tries to see while riding on Simon's shoulders, he asks Gimmy to "find a hole". Misunderstanding this request, Gimmy sticks his finger into Simon's "personal hole", which causes Simon to leap into the air with a scream of pain, rising high enough to get a glimpse of the other side. When Kamina finds out what he managed, he asks Gimmy to poke him as well. While this scene was among the content that wasn't included in the TV version of the episode (which replaced much of its racier content with a Clip Show), it did go on to serve as the inspiration for the "attack" Gimmy uses on various characters in the very NSFW fifth Parallels Works video.
-   _Time Stop Hero_: Kuzuno Sekai freezes time and strips Lovisa naked, only to find that she saw this coming and concealed pieces of paper with messages for him. He finds one in her cleavage, one in her vagina, and one in her butt.
-   In the second season of _The Tower of Druaga_, little kid character Ki fights soldiers and people that annoy her by employing this technique with a spoon.
-   _Why the Hell Are You Here, Teacher!?_:
    
    -   Satou is forced to give Kana a suppository when she gets a cold. Making matters worse, since he was blindfolded to let Kana keep her dignity, the first try was... “not successful.”
    
    -   The next day when Satou gets her cold, Kana returns the favor when she finds out he pretended to be sick to skip class. And she's _not_ gentle about it.
-   _YuYu Hakusho_: Yusuke performs a kancho on Kuwabara before the Chapter Black arc.

-   In _Larva_, Yellow becomes a problem in "Gum Fart", and needs a good plugging. Of course, it doesn't work for long.
-   _Adventurer Carly_ features Bobby getting plugged up after being accidentally shoved by the protagonist butt-first onto a traffic cone in his introduction scene. It later becomes a Running Gag that the boy's butt becomes a target for slapstick violence.

    Comic Books 

-   Deadpool has Hammerspace-like abilities which he once explained as "involving an awful lot of lubricant".
-   Averted in _Warlock and the Infinity Watch_. Most of the Watch keep their Infinity Gems on their foreheads, but Drax swallows his<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and when Pip is asked where his is, he is seen walking away from the camera with the focus suspiciously close to his backside. A later issue reveals that he somehow stored it between his toes.
-   In Alan Moore's _Lost Girls_, Alice describes an occasion where her governess Mrs. Redmond taught her how to play Chess. This led to a sexual encounter where the older woman inserted an ivory pawn into Alice's ass. This left her unable to play Chess.
-   In an issue of the older _Batman_ comics, Robin's tackling of a bad guy from behind places his face too close to said bad guy's posterior to be comfortable.
-   One of the "superheroes" in _The Boys_ apparently has a fetish for getting screwed by his own gun(s) and licking them afterward.
-   An early _Hothead Paisan: Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist_ story had Hothead shove a telephone pole up a random man's ass as retribution towards women getting raped and her belief that all men had claimed that women liked getting raped.
-   _Johnny the Homicidal Maniac_: During Johnny's rampage at a Taco Smell:
    
    **Victim 1:** Oh dear God!  
    **Victim 2:** My eyes!! I can't see my eyes!  
    **Victim 3:** Aaagh!  
    **Victim 4:** Noooo!  
    **Victim 5:** Eeek!  
    **Victim 6:** Somebodeee! _Pull this churrito out of my ass!_
    
-   A short but full-color _Judge Dredd_ story introduces The Great Arsoli, whose act involves pulling ever larger things from his nether regions. The last is his lovely, smiling assistant. Dredd arrests him for not declaring those items through customs.
-   _Lanfeust_: The giant troll is deafeated when Or-Azur rams a pointy branch and his sword up his backside. According to Hébus, the hemorroids are the weakpoint of trolls.
-   _Level Up_: While in medical school, Dennis has to shove his finger up the butts of male patients to do prostate exams. Much later, he finds out he saved one man's life by finding something bad that was up there, and they were able to operate and remove whatever it was that he found.
-   In _Nodwick_, after Artex and Yeager do something that actually succeeds in making her angry, Piffany threatens to "deliver religious literature to \[them\] every day for the rest of \[their\] lives _as a suppository!_" if they don't fix it.
-   A rather nasty Ass Shove occurs in _Preacher_ (and given the general nature of the series, that's _really_ saying something) when Jesse is attacked by a psychotic goth punk with a sword. Though the actual act occurs off-panel, the next page shows the sword tip poking out of the man's stomach and the hilt protruding from the seat of his pants. Ouch.
    -   An even worse one where Jesse uses the Word of God when telling the asshole sheriff to go fuck himself. As the paramedics explain to the sheriff's son, they can't _pull his father's severed penis from his rectum_.
    -   In the "Good Ol' Boys" arc, Jodie is tricked into pit-fighting a gorilla and is given a baseball bat as his only weapon. After winning, he asks the promoter if he needs the bat back.
-   It is implied that this is where Max of _Sam & Max: Freelance Police_ keeps his gun, though it's still none of your damn business. Though maybe later, when everyone's sitting down, he'll tell us.
-   In _The Sandman (1989)_, Loki tells the Puck about a prank he once played on the "not very bright" Thor. Disguised as a doctor, he convinces Thor that he's pregnant and tells him to lie face down and wait for him to deliver the baby. Loki then feeds him a gallon of castor oil and sticks a cork up his butt, then goes off to sleep with Thor's wife. Eight days later, Thor is still lying there waiting when Ratatosk, the squirrel of the World Tree, comes by and, curious, pulls the cork out, releasing eight days' worth of backed-up feces. Thor picks up the stunned Ratatosk, embraces him, and says "You're ugly, you're hairy, and you're covered in shit. But you're mine, and I love you!"
-   Something similar occurs in _Sin City - The Big Fat Kill_. Miho apparently shoves her katana up a merc's ass. We see the hilt behind him and the tip protruding from his face. Considering the angle, that's exactly what happened. In the same story, Jackie-Boy slips and falls on Miho's swastika shuriken and it gets stuck in his backside.
    
    **Jackie-Boy:** DON'T NOBODY LAUGH! THIS ISN'T FUNNY!
    
-   A rather serious example is implied in a two-part story in _Spider-Man's Tangled Web_ featuring Tombstone as a Villain Protagonist. While in prison, he recruits small-time super-villains Hyno Hustler, Rocket Racer, and Big Ben to work for him, and in an early part of one issue asks what they've managed to "hold onto". Racer says he has some vaseline, and Tombstone says that "might be useful". Later, after Tombstone is beaten up by a corrupt corrections officer working for the Kangaroo, he manages to smuggle a knife into his cell. When Racer asks where he got it, Tombstone says, "Hid it. Told you the vaseline would be useful." (A career criminal like Tombstone would probably be good at a trick like this, which Real Life convicts can and do manage on occasion.)
-   In the JMS iteration of _Squadron Supreme_, Emil Burbank once shoved Tom Thumb (who, as his name suggests, is quite small) up Shape's rectum, ostensibly to gauge the feasibility of using Shape to smuggle things into battle. Knowing Burbank, his actual intention was probably just to make both Shape and Thumb miserable out of spite.
-   _Superman_:
    -   _Supergirl (1982)_: As she is arguing with a police in issue #12, Supergirl is said to get a badge if she wants to play cop. Kara retorts by asking if he wants to know what he can do with _his_ badge.
        
        **Lieutenant Peters:** You wanna play cop, join the department and get yourself a badge! Until then, stay out of my way!  
        **Supergirl:** You need a hint as to what you can do with your badge, Peters?
        
    -   In _Superman: American Alien_, Superman threatens to do this to Lobo with his bike.

-   One crossover event in Marvel's Ultimate universe feature the Hulk walk into a diner, stark naked, and politely ask for pancakes, producing a wad of bills to prove that he could pay for them. The diner staff immediately noted that as he A) had no pockets and B) his hands had been empty before he'd produced the money and were disturbed by the implication of where that meant he'd been carrying it.

    Comic Strips 

-   One _Dilbert_ strip has Dilbert open a software package, and by doing so agree to a full-body cavity search at any time. Enter a woman with the Glove Snap.
-   The implication of this is the punchline for one _The Far Side_ cartoon, which depicts a time-traveling scientist with a giant thermometer approaching a dinosaur from behind.
    
    "An instant later, both Professor Waxman and his time machine are obliterated, leaving the cold-blooded/warm-blooded dinosaur debate still unresolved."
    
-   _Madam & Eve_:
-   In one _Ogri_ strip, Mitzi responds to a loutish driver's proposition by shoving his head up his own arse.
-   When Bob's Player Character is exploring Uzer's pyramid in _Knights of the Dinner Table,_ he finds a valuable-looking medallion. He has his character "keister" it so he doesn't have to share it with the others. This turns out to be instrumental later when it's revealed to be a component for the Scepter of Five Parts. Amusingly, Bob had actually forgotten about it, meaning it's been... keistered for some time.

He complains about this later, saying that it "went right up Main Street".
-   _Gaz, Taster of PTSD_: When Gaz is having a several-days-long PTSD attack regarding the pork curse incident, Torque makes the mistake of taunting her by serving her a pig's head with an apple in its mouth on a silver platter.

    **Superman:** Easy, Logan. I've gotcha.  
    **Wolverine:** You've got me, huh? Guess who's got you?
    
-   Three separate examples in _Kitsune no Ken: Fist of the Fox_:
    -   The first has Kakashi pulling this, complete with the infamous shout of "A THOUSAND YEARS OF PAIN!" The recipient is Hidan, and it's with Hidan's own knife that was earlier used in an attempt to kill Kakashi.
    -   The second is done by Hana to Tsunade as part of the older woman's annual gynecological examination, and Hana does it slowly, gently, and with a gloved and lubed finger; regardless, Tsunade still finds it pretty uncomfortable.
    -   The third is done by Hana again, during the fic's thirteenth Gaiden chapter on her husband Idate. He admits to initial weird feelings followed by arousal.
-   The "keeping things in your ass" version is implied in _Light and Dark The Adventures of Dark Yagami_ when Dark pulls his cell phone out of his "secret place" in his pants.
-   Implied and discussed in _The Loud House_ fanfiction _Lincoln is Done_, when Luna says that she wants to stick Lola's tiara right up _some_ orifice of hers, but changes her mind when she notices baby Lily nearby.
-   _Little Hands, Big Attitude_: Obsidian thinks that the dog with the squiker toy up its but (which squiks every time it barks) is the funniest thing he's ever seen.
-   _Naru-Hina Chronicles_: When Suigetsu makes fun of her umbrella, Yuko threatens to "shove it where the sun don't shine."
-   This trope is exploited by Ranma in the fanfic _Smartarse ½_. Ranma beats up Kunō for the first time, then writes "At least it can't possibly get any worse" on his forehead.

-   _Sailor Moon Abridged_: _All_ the cool devices Luna produces for the cast come right out of her butt.
-   A common meme in _Touhou Project_ fanworks is to have the character Kamishirasawa Keine "cave" somebody, meaning she uses the horns of her Were-Hakutaku form (or as Touhou fans call it, Ex-Keine) to perform this trope. This is usually Played for Laughs.

    **Scott:** Since we are making ourselves perfectly clear, Bruno, let me tell you how it is. You're going to be polite and respectful to everyone going on this trip. You're also going to leave Bobby and me alone.  
    **Bruno:** Or?  
    **Scott:** Or I'm going to wipe the ground with you, punk. I'm tired of your insult throwing, bad attitude, delinquent wannabe, whiney-ass, momma's boy, country-music-reject, self, already. If you don't behave, I'm going to take the nearest blunt object, something close to the size of Warren, Hank, and their tents and stuff it up your largest body crevice. I don't like bullies and I won't tolerate them. Bullies tend to bring out the worst in me. Did I make myself perfectly clear to you Bruno?
    
-   RealityCheck's Nyxverse: _Nyx's Family_ starts with Shining Armor treating a visiting Twilight Sparkle and her adopted daughter Nyx coldly due to his unfortunate history with the latter during her stint as Nightmare Moon. This puts Twilight in such a bad mood that she threatens Shining with this trope to get him to stop insulting Nyx. It works.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Duck Duck Goose_ has Peg the goose get his head stuck up a pig's butt briefly. Later, a pig comes down on his face frome above, as he weakly says "not again".
-   _Hotel E_: At the very end, a farmer rabbit in overalls has a carrot stuck up his rear, and lit on fire. Via cartoon logic, this inflates the rabbit, and the gas shot out propels him a ways.
-   A long Running Gag of _Beavis and Butt-Head Do America_ is that Agent Flemming of the FBI has nearly every character in the story subjected to a full body cavity search.
-   _Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return_ has Wiser the owl say he has a large piece of wood lodged in his hindquarters after tumbling over and destroying part of a fence.

-   Stella the Skunk from _Over the Hedge_ is given a makeover to look like a cat so she can seduce distract Tiger, the housecat owned by the film's antagonistic suburban homeowner.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Jim Carrey seems to have a fair amount of his films involving this.
    -   In _The Mask_, Stanley Ipkiss uses the mask's powers to get back at his shady car mechanics by shoving exhaust pipes up their asses. It makes more sense if you remember to call them "tailpipes".
    -   _Bruce Almighty_. The title character uses god-powers to exact ironic revenge on some guys who taunted and attacked him earlier in the film. Really the wrong time to say that the chances of something happening were as low as the chance of a monkey climbing out of your ass. Worse, when he's done with the monkey, he has it _go back where it came from_. So: a Butt-Monkey produces a butt monkey.
    -   In the uncut version of _Me, Myself & Irene_, Charlie's "sons" punish a big-mouthed cop for insulting their "father" in front of them by shoving a chicken head-first into his backside.

    **Doc:** Oh no, you don't _drink_ it... _(brings out rectal syringe and bends him over)_
    
-   The direct-to-video Japanese movie _Shyness Machine Girl_'s protagonist fights with a machine gun protruding from... well...\[1\]
-   In the 2005 film _Chaos_, the title character is enraged at a girl for fatally wounding his son. In revenge, he anally rapes her with a very large hunting knife. It's neither Played for Laughs nor given much of a Gory Discretion Shot and her screams are truly terrifying.
-   _The Jackhammer Massacre_. Is any further elaboration really necessary?
-   Jim Levenstein gets a trumpet shoved up his butt in _American Pie 2_. Michelle, who in the first film tells him she shoved a flute up her pussy, does it to him, being all kinky and everything.
-   Occurs frequently in _Another Gay Movie_, especially with Andy.
-   In _Are You Being Served?_, Mr. Humphries and Mr. Lucas have to measure an emir's inside leg without touching him. To do so, Mr. Humphries uses a deflating balloon, which blows up his robe... and ends up being quite pleasurable for him.
-   _Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me_
    -   Austin and Felicity Shagwell are in a tent unpacking gear to infiltrate Dr. Evil's island base. Their silhouettes look like Felicity is pulling various stuff—including twelve feet of rope and an umbrella—out of Austin's posterior... to the astonishment of Evil's mooks watching outside.
    -   Felicity is ordered to plant a homing device on Fat Bastard _by any means necessary_. She complies by having _sex_ with Fat Bastard, and then planting the device by shoving it—you know where—thinking that he's so fat he won't notice. Unfortunately, he does... and assumes it's some type of kinky foreplay, causing him to develop a "crush" on her (what follows is the most disgusting scene _ever_ to hit the big screen, when Austin performs a one-man version of "Two Girls One Cup").
-   In _Avengers: Endgame_, Thor threatens to do this to a _Fortnite_ player named NoobMaster69 for calling his friend Korg a dickhead.
    
    **Thor:** NoobMaster, hey, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy, if you don't log off this game right now, I'm gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms, and shove them up your butt!
    
-   Implied in _Avengers: Infinity War_: Rocket gives Thor a cybernetic eye to replace the one he lost in _Thor: Ragnarok_, explaining that he stole it, had only one good place to hide it, and that Thor might want to wash it before using it.

He's been "shitting pancakes ever since". The protagonists' great-grandmother then replies that she's had plenty of things shoved up her butt. Then again, she used to be a German prostitute.
    -   Also worth mentioning that during their final matches against the Germans, Todd was partnered with Barry in the pong match. Seriously drunk, he proposed another challenge: the losers of this match has to take their paddles up their asses. Barry & Todd ultimately won, with the Germans they played against proceeding to shove their paddles up their ass. Cue their reaction faces expressing some form of butthurt.

-   The serial killers trio in the X-rated thriller _Body Weapon_ indulges in doing this. Notably, their first two onscreen kill is a couple making out, the man who's subjected to an Undignified Death by having fifty coins shoved up where the sun doesn't shine. A later scene had the policeman protagonist investigating a handful of bloodied coins in a plastic evidence bag, said to be extracted from the rectum of the corpse.

    **Talos:** _\[confused\]_ Am I just supposed to _guess_ where that is?  
    **Everyone:** _Your ass_.

-   The baseball-themed slasher film _The Catcher_ has character Billy killed by being duct taped to a table, and a baseball bat shoved up his rear. The fact that it was a bat that went up there isn't revealed until a little bit later, so it initially looks like poor Billy was just plain raped.

It's left deliberately vague if Hardy really did hide the transmitter this way.

-   _Everything Everywhere All at Once_: Two Alphaverse Jumpers have shove their butts into _butt plug-shaped trophies_ in order to gain martial arts abilities. It very much makes sense in context.

-   _Evolution_
    -   Orlando Jones's character, Harry Block, has to make a trip to the emergency room after an alien bug has burrowed up his backside.
        
        **Nurse:** I'll get the lubricant.

        **Harry Block:** There's ALWAYS time for lubricant!!
        
    -   They also kill the super-evolved amoeba alien by giving it a Head and Shoulders enema, with a _firehose_. Harry actually gets _sucked into this alien's ass for a moment or so_. The obvious agreement is made.

-   _Fletch_. The title Intrepid Reporter undergoes a rectal exam from a proctologist while masquerading as a patient.
    
    **Fletch:** You know, my kidneys feel a lot better in this position? Maybe it's because I'm not doing any calisthenics. You know, if I did some sit-ups in the morning... bent over like this, I feel 100% better _(squish!)_... _Moooooooooooon riveeeeeeeeeeeer!_ Thank you, Doc.

    -   In the third film, she does the same thing to the rapist stepfather of one of the people in the rape survivor group she's in. Only instead of using a shotgun, she uses a length of metal pipe. Which she proceeds to drive into him with a _sledgehammer_. Damn.

-   Shows up in _RoboGeisha_ with the cybernetic AssSword, which is exactly what it sounds like. Considering the rest of the film, it's surprising when the girls point out that using a sword protruding from your ass is not only embarrassing, but also really awkward to use. It doesn't stop them from having a sword fight around a conveniently placed stripper pole.
-   The woman vigilante of _Run Bitch Run!_ plays it to the extreme, and very unexpectedly, with her rapist. This particular ass shove involves a machete and a lot of reciprocal motion.

-   Played for Drama in _Slaughter in Xi'an_, an excruciatingly violent Chinese film, where one of the characters is killed by having a long, steel rod pointed on one end shoved through his rectum, all the way until penetrating his guts. Apparently this was done to kill a person without leaving _injuries on the outside_.
-   Referenced in _The Tall Guy_. Dexter is talking to Kate at the hospital, when a man on another guerney starts groaning.
    
    **Patient:** Nurse, if you wouldn't mind? I am in some pain here.  
    **Kate**(walks over to him): You will be treated when I see fit. You forfeited the right to be treated in a reasonable manner when you made the decision to stick a vacuum cleaner pipe up your bottom.
    
-   Similarly, from _Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead_: "Buckwheats for everyone!"
-   Averted in _Thunderball_ as Bond is given a large capsule-shaped homing device—he asks what he's supposed to do with it and Q replies "Well, obviously, you... _swallow_ it!"
-   Also hinted (but with a mere handgun) at _Tropic Thunder_.
-   The movie version of _Undercover Brother_ literally puts his foot up someone's arse (yes, there's even an X-ray to demonstrate).

        **Groping**: There your rifle, an' there's your bayonet. You know where to put it, don't ya?
        
        **Lurk**: _Yes_, I know where I'd _like_ to put it...
        
-   _Watch Your Stern_: When Commander Fanshawe tells Chief Mundy that he knows what he can do with his bicycle, Chief Mundy's first thought is that Commander Fanshawe is telling him he can stick it up his arse.
-   One can't help but notice _Wayne's World_'s Officer Koharski's glee, both in his eyes and in the snap of his glove, as part of a roadside check no less. The walk of poor Benjamin's when we see him next speaks volumes.

    Jokes 

-   There's a joke about three explorers who were captured by a native tribe. The natives say that the explorers may survive if they collect and bring back ten pieces of a fruit of their choosing. The first explorer returns with ten berries and is told he'll go free if he gets all ten inside his anus. He succeeds and is released. The second explorer returns with ten apples and is told the same. He suddenly bursts out laughing; when the natives ask what's so funny, he tells them that the third explorer was collecting pineapples.
    -   A variation has the third man arrive, have the task explained to him, and choose death after some consideration. The natives then proceed to execute him in the traditional way, by inserting a fatal number of pineapples into his anus.
    -   Yet another variation has the natives telling them that they will kill them if they make any facial expression whatsoever during the 'challenge', and the one telling the joke is encouraged to announce the number out loud. The first explorer, having something large-ish (like apples), is killed after a few (3-4) for grimacing. The second explorer, having picked something small (berries or grapes), allows the one telling the joke to count up to 7 or 8, then the explorer inexplicably bursts out laughing and gets killed as a result. The two explorers meet in Heaven, and the first one is distressed, asking the second what had happened since he was doing so well... the second explorer, still laughing, says "I just saw the third guy, and he's got PINEAPPLES!".
    -   Yet _another_ variation: a trader is heading through the jungle with a load of bananas, but then he's captured by cannibals. They decide they want to stuff him before cooking him, so they proceed to shove the bananas up his ass...and the trader starts laughing hysterically. The cannibal chief asks, "What's so funny?" The trader's response? "My partner's a half-day behind me, with a load of pineapples!"
-   There's a Christmas joke that an angel approaches Santa Claus while he's in a bad mood and asks "Where should I put the Christmas Tree?" As you might have guessed, Santa's reply was something along the lines of "Stick it up your ass!" ...and that's why the angel goes on top of the Christmas tree every year.
    -   One version has him asking for it by saying "Oi, fatty! Where should I stick this?"
-   This joke from a WWII vet regarding rectal exams: "Well, first he put his right hand on my shoulder. No, wait, he put his left hand on my shoulder. Wait a minute, he put both his hands on my shoulders."
-   A doctor is making his rounds through the hospital when he stops to talk to the head nurse. The nurse says, "By the way, doctor, did you know you've got your thermometer stuck behind your ear?" The doctor feels around his ear and says, "Great, some asshole has my pen."
-   A farmer looked out his window and saw that one of his cows was near the road and having difficulty giving birth, so he went out and took a hold of the calf's legs and started tugging. Before long a luxury car stopped and a man got out asking if he could help. The Farmer said it would be appreciated. The man took off his Rolex and rolled up his sleeves, and after both men did some tugging the calf came out just fine and healthy. The farmer thanked the stranger, who said: "I just have one question... how fast was the little cow going when it hit the big cow?"
-   A doctor was surprised when he examined his elderly patient. "Sir... do you know you've got a suppository in your ear?" The old man promptly takes out his cell phone and calls his wife. "Martha, you can stop looking for my hearing aid. I think I know where I put it."
-   A hillbilly goes to the doctor for the first time in decades. The doctor prescribes him some suppositories, which he doesn't know how to use but isn't about to admit to some city slicker. A week later, he comes back absolutely furious. "Dammit doc, I took them suppositories like you said and the damn things don't work! One a day for a week with a glass of water, and lemme tell you, I could've shoved'em up my _ass_ and it'd have had more effect!"
    -   Another variation has the doctor tell the patient to put the suppository "in his back passage." The punchline is the same but suggests the patient left the supp on a table just inside the back door of his house.
    -   Yet another one has the patient complain that he'd used all the suppositories but there was no effect whatsoever. To which doctor incredulously replied: "How can this be? Did you eat them or something?" - and got this response, Sarcasm Mode full on: "No, dammit, I shoved them up my ass!"
-   A man walks into a bar with his pet monkey. He orders a drink while the monkey hops up onto the pool table. The monkey grabs one of the pool balls, shoves it in his mouth, and swallows it whole. The angry bartender tells the man he has to pay for a new ball and the man agrees, paying. The man returns several weeks later, with the monkey. The man orders a drink, while the monkey hops onto the bar and goes for the jar of pickled eggs. He takes out an egg and shoves it up his ass. Then he takes it out of his ass and eats it.
    
    **Bartender:** _\[disgusted\]_ Gross! Your monkey just ate a pickled egg that he shoved up his ass!  
    **Man:** Yeah, ever since that pool ball came out of him, he makes sure to measure everything first.
    
-   A man goes to the doctor and is diagnosed with a tapeworm. The doctor says he can get rid of it if the man comes back the next day with a banana and two cookies (or some other combination of health and junk food). The man comes back with the items, and the doctor tells him to drop his pants and bend over. The doctor then shoves the banana up his ass, followed by the cookies. He then instructs the man to come back the next days with the same items. Wanting the tapeworm gone, the man obeys. The next day, the process is repeated, and the doctors tell him to come back tomorrow. For a length of time, the man comes every day and has the items shoved up his ass. Finally, the doctor tells him to come back with a banana and a hammer. After a sleepless night wondering what the hammer is going to feel like, the man returns. The doctor shoves the banana up his ass, grabs the hammer... and waits. After a few minutes, the tapeworm sticks his head out and demands his cookies, at which point the doctor hits him with the hammer.

    Literature 

-   In the _Animorphs_ book "The Sickness", Tobias (a boy turned into a hawk) angrily says Cassie's veterinarian father is a quack because he tried to treat him by shoving a pill up his rear.

-   In the tenth _Captain Underpants_ book, Tippy Tinkletrousers' Robo-Trousers are equipped with a thermonuclear bomb, which are activated by having a robotic tentacle pull it out through the nether regions. It Makes Sense in Context... sorta.
-   In part of Greg Stillson's backstory in Stephen King's novel _The Dead Zone_, some people who anger him end up with objects inserted in their rectum. To be fair to the character, said people were mooks send to give him a hard time. In a 3 to 1 fight. Armed with brass knuckles. Guess what it is that ends up there.
-   In the _Deathstalker_ series a woman was forced to approach a man who would decide her fate completely in the nude. She had decided to break clean but she couldn't carry any regular concealed weapon... but a deactivated monofilament blade's handle was relatively easy to hide in the one place the guards wouldn't look.
-   In "Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption" from _Different Seasons_, this is apparently how Andy smuggled several hundred dollars into jail, and how Red gets his manuscript out... Willing suspension of disbelief (or perhaps Fridge Horror) applies because the manuscript is better than 100 handwritten pages. Ahem.
-   Inverted in _Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency_, when Dirk demonstrates his facility with stage magic by (apparently) drawing a string of colored handkerchiefs from the posterior of a small dog, and from Richard's, a slim bunch of anemones. Which he presents to the dog's owner, a little old lady who just watched Richard take off all his clothes and jump into a canal. It makes sense... sort of... in context.
-   From Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_:
    -   In _Feet of Clay_, after the golem Dorfl is freed, he visits his previous masters and exacts (non-lethal) ironic revenge on them. As Vimes, Carrot, and Angua chase him, they hear about... _incidents_ at the poultry merchant's and the pork butcher's.
        
        "Er... I think I've got an ointment that might be—"

        "Ouch."

    -   Vimes threatens a comparable punishment for any assassin caught carrying a spring-gonne within Anhk-Morpork city limits. "Rest assured, I can find a short cut." This line makes more sense when you know that people have previously referred to a little place near Lancre where the sun doesn't shine (which, if you know your Disc geography, means a deep gorge near the village of Bad Ass).
    -   The whole bit about the monkey's nut _and_ the garderobe in _Lords and Ladies_.
    -   Self-inflicted by a drop bear in _The Last Continent_, when it unwisely drops butt-first onto an unsuspecting victim who happens to be Rincewind. Turns out that pointy "WIZZARD" hat is good for something after all...
    -   Vimes actually does this in _Night Watch_... to a couple of oxen. With ginger. The ensuing carnage changes the course of history.
    -   _The Truth_: Dibbler takes up feng shui as a sideline and tells customers to beware the Dragon of Unhappiness which flies up one's bottom if the toilet seat is left up. The nature of belief within the magical field of the Disc has predictable results.
-   In Michael Shea's _The Extra_, one of the main characters hides a 20 gauge mini-shotgun and ammo in her rectum and vagina when she goes to take part in a movie shoot (in the future, movie shoots involve extras fighting for their lives against animatronic monsters). A sympathetic make-up artist could tell by her walk that she's keistering something. Instead of snitching, he tells her a location where she can safely take out the gun and gives her a fanny pack to store the ammo.
-   _Gangsta Granny_: Ben talks about how in the olden days, people were punished with a "red-hot poker up the bum".

    -   In _Bearing an Hourglass_, Norton is forced to reverse the course of time for the entire world. While most people don't notice, anyone close to Norton becomes aware that they're doing everything backward... including one unfortunate man who'd just used the toilet. Despite his struggles to stop himself, the man backs into the bathroom and shuts the door, through which sounds of horror are heard, and the rather confused-looking dog that was behind a nearby bush as well.
    -   In _For Love of Evil_, a past incarnation of Gaea humiliated Parry by having him subjected to a cavity search by an ape.

-   In the Brazilian novel _O Homem Que Matou Getúlio Vargas_ (released in English as _Twelve Fingers_), Henry Maturin of _Papillon_ had a way to leave prison with important stuff such as money: fill up bamboo with it and shove it up there. The protagonist gets afraid of doing this to himself, so Maturin decides to "carry it" for him ("where one fits, two can!").
-   _Paladin of Shadows_: In _A Deeper Blue_, the central receiver for the bugs Katya plants on Juan Gonzales' boat is hidden in her rectum prior to being installed.
-   In _Papillon_, this is critical survival tactic. Shoving a small metal cylinder full of money, called a _plan_, up the rectum and using the cash to buy supplies or make bribes.
    -   In _Banco_, the sequel to _Papillon_, it's revealed that Papillon held onto his _plan_; the metal tube used to hide money and valuables up his ass, after his release from prison. Even on the outside it was a good way to protect his cash and he had gotten used to it after fourteen years, he wasn't bothered by keeping it another year or two while he funds his revenge.

-   Sharpe does this with a picklock, which he then uses to bust out of jail. He actually does it "onscreen" too (though not explicitly), making this "Chekhov's Buttscratch".

-   In one essay in _Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey Brain!_, Scott Adams discusses the acceptable level of ass in a comic strip.

-   In David Barnett's _Gideon Smith and the Mask of the Ripper_, a brothel madame named Lizzie Strutter finds an extremely beautiful amnesiac girl named Lottie (Charlotte Elmswood). Even better Lizzie learns that Lottie is a virgin, so Lizzie can sell that to the highest bidder. She also needs a rival thrashed so she gets thug Henry Savage for wetworks. Henry lusts after Lottie, but Lizzie needs her a virgin. So she offers Henry a jar of goose fat, if Henry succeeds he gets to anally rape Lottie as much as he wants, provided he doesn't otherwise hurt her (no bruises on the face...etc). Luckily Maria, a clockwork girl who's looks were based on Charlotte's, discovers the girl and takes Lottie's place and then gives Henry a different kind of encounter.
-   In the _Anno Dracula_ novel _One Thousand Monsters_, during the human sacrifice of Japanese undesirables at the Suicide Park of Yokai Town, the westernized obstructive bureaucrat begs for a swift death as he's bent over and buggered by the long, barbed tongue of a hungry Kappa.

Leodora is first to be dunked in the sea until everything from the stomach, bowels and bladder is voided out. Then a sharp stick is to be slowly pushed up her ass until it's all along her spine.

-   In World Domination in Retrospect, the ass-shove is practically the main character's Signature Move, he does it so often. He refers to it as 63ing your ass.
    
    "First, insert hand into enemy ass. If your hand is a hook, this is even less pleasant for the other person. Then, you rotate them 63 degrees along a random axis... Then you release."

    Music Videos 

-   At the start of the video for Bubble Butt, three women are accosted by a Giant Woman who summons bike pump hoses from her mouth that shove themselves up the women's butts and inflate their rear ends to a cartoonishly large size.

    Podcasts 

-   As discussed in _Fat, French and Fabulous_, Canadian serial killer Alan Legere escaped from prison using a TV antenna he hid up his anus to fight off the guards. Presumably, he removed it from his anal cavity first, but it's much funnier to imagine him attacking the guards with it still sticking out of his ass like a bee stinger.
-   The genetically designed CLINTs of _Mission to Zyxx_ keep a backup weapon in their anal cavity. Dar is enthralled by the visual.
-   This gets discussed on the Rooster Teeth podcast, where Burnie quite openly mocks the whole "it just happened to go right up my arse as I fell" story.
-   Referred to as "corndogging", the subject is a repeated topic of discussion in the comedy podcast _Walking The Room_. Notable examples include the open question as to "Why you gotsa go corndoggin' when you know you got frien?" (sic) and the discussion of plans for _Corndog: The Movie_, summed up as "A man puts his arm elbow-deep into another man's ass, and then they solve crimes."

-   WWE has twice done skits involving a colonoscopy—both with the same "You have your head up your ass!" punchline and both Gooker winners. The second came days after a commentator actually had one!
-   One of The Rock's (in)famous catchphrases. He occasionally adds a few more phrases before shoving in the last three:

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Ass of Holding. Exactly What It Says on the Tin.
-   This<small>◊</small> story from 4chan's /tg/ board details how one player played as a concubine who was nothing but The Load to the party throughout the entire campaign, much to the other players' great frustration. When the party reaches the Dark Lord's fortress, the concubine immediately betrays the party and declares her undying love for the Dark Lord. The party is locked in the dungeon while the concubine and the Dark Lord get married. They return to his chambers to consummate the marriage, and as soon as he turns his back, a halfling rogue emerges from the concubine's ass, shoots straight up the Dark Lord's ass, and tears him apart from the inside. The rogue was the poster's real character all along, making use of the "Extremely Tight Space" skill, and the concubine was merely a hired NPC. He had even secretly been making rolls the entire campaign in order to avoid falling out early and ruining the surprise for the rest of the group, who were all naturally left speechless by The Reveal.
-   The infamous "arseplomancer" build for _Dungeons & Dragons_ 3.5: the Exemplar class lets you pick one skill which can be used to impress people, and a high enough Escape Artist skill lets you pass through a space narrower than your head. The result is a character who climbs into a guy's rectum in a manner so awesome that everyone in 60 ft becomes undyingly loyal to him. Then the poor guy explodes.

    **Kokonoe:** You say that again and I'll fill every hole of yours with my special candy!
    
-   This trailer for _Marvel vs. Capcom 3_, where a stray attack by Morrigan touches an unsuspecting Deadpool in a bad place. The look on her face when she realizes what she's done is priceless. Or maybe she's just confused by the giant "GYAAAAA" sticking out of the building.
-   _Arc the Lad: Twilight of Spirits_
    -   In-game example, whenever you have Delma in your party. So, you're in a fight, maybe you're in trouble, one of your characters is in critical condition, you'd really need a healing item... Then you remember that you put one in Delma's inventory. Come on, try and guess where she pulls it from. Exactly.
    -   Also seen in cutscenes when Darc draws his sword. We don't actually see much apart from Darc reaching toward the hem of his kilt-like garment and seeing the sword in his hand after a sword-drawing sound effect. Its never explained where he stows his sword between fights but...
-   Inverted in _Assassin's Creed II_, where Caterina Sforza's rant against the Orsi brothers includes the threat to shove their heads up her vagina; this isn't scripted dialog but something the historical Caterina actually said.
    -   The captive Bartolomeo d'Alviano promises his jailors that when he escapes, he's going to shove their heads up their asses — and he's not going to be matching heads and asses, either.
    -   In _Assassin's Creed: Odyssey_, the player character gets hold of an obsidian eye belonging to a one-eyed mercenary known as the Cyclops.

Afterward, you can even hunt down that goat and retrieve the eye; the item description now states that it smells really bad.
-   _Baldur's Gate II_: Minsc manages to keep Boo hidden from Irenicus's capture party. Supposedly there is ever so much of Minsc to search. Imoen speaks for everyone by going, "Ew, I don't want to know." Not that Minsc looks anything like Richard Gere, but...
-   _Bloodborne_: An unfortunate, unforeseen consequence of making backstabs in this game work by way of ramming your hand into the foe and ripping it back out, along with making one of the game's enemies a giant boar, is the fact that backstabbing this same boar looks less like a brutal finisher, and more like, well, this trope.
    -   Exaggerated in the Buttborne montage.
-   The Korean arcade game _Boong-Ga Boong-Ga_ requires players to jab a plastic finger into a protruding butt (euphemistically described as "spanking" in English advertisements). Higher scores are rewarded for stronger pokes. However, to win the prize (which is a gold-colored plastic keychain in the shape of a poop, by the way), you need to deliver a poke that is within the strength marked by the power bar on the screen.
-   _Burrito Bison Revenge_ is a Launch Game about a buffalo-man trying to retrieve his wallet from the Gummies that stole it in the previous game. However, the main character also grabs hundreds of dollars from the gummies to be used for upgrades, leading one player on Kongregate to ask where he was keeping his money before he got his wallet back. The developer's response? "You don't want to know".
-   _Conker's Bad Fur Day_:
    -   The Great Mighty Poo, in his operatic Villain Song, threatens to take Conker's head and ram it up his butt. Conker is noticeably grossed out.
    -   When two fire imps decide to burn Conker up, one of the imps asks his friend what he should do with his lit cigarette. He tells him to shove it up his ass. The first imp responds… by actually doing it.
-   Since most enemies in the _Dark Souls_ series are much taller than the player, the majority of backstabs in these games become ass shoves. The Fang Boar in the Undead Parish also has an opening in its armor around its tail, allowing "backstabs" straight up the wazoo. But, importantly, the ones in the Duke's Archive _do not_, making them much harder to damage.
-   The skills in _Disco Elysium_ tries to convince the Detective to do this to himself at several points.
    -   By choosing enough dialogue options, where the Detective makes a pledge by swearing on his honor, causes the Authority skill to chime in, and try to convince you to perform the "Rite of Honour":
        
        **Authority:** You need to bring the thumb of your right hand — your sword hand — to your rectum and stick it in there to form the Arch of Honours.
        
    -   Upon getting the flask of Blue Medicinal Spirit, the necktie and the Electrochemistry skill are both gleeful:
        
        **Horrific Necktie:** _Bratan_, I am so proud. Now — whatever you do, don't drink it. This deserves so much more than just regular _oral_ consumption.  
        **Electrochemistry:** The tie is _SO_ on the money there! Up the bum it goes!
        
-   In _Discworld II_, Rincewind has to convince the mortician that he's dead and uses some ice to lower his body temperature. Guess where the thermometer, and thus the ice, have to go...
-   Similarly, in _Dragon Age: Origins_ the player might run into a prisoner who offers a key in exchange for food. If the player asks how he managed to slip the key past his captors' search, he'll answer that he swallowed it and it has... later come back into his possession. The key, upon further examination, is... "Strangely warm."
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   Implied at one point in _An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire_. When asking a Scamp where it hid the key:
        
        **Scamp:** Keys? Keys in dark, NASTY place. Near my tail. Want look? See?
        
    -   In _The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion_, there is an imprisoned Morag Tong assassin and a note from his captors mentioning how they have no idea who hired him to kill them because they couldn't find his orders anywhere on his person. If you attempt to pickpocket the assassin or kill him and loot his body, you will find a "Soiled Writ of Assassination".
    -   In _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_, if the player is arrested and sent to prison, and they elect to escape, they will have a single lockpick on their person to use to try to get free. Precisely how they got it into their cell isn't stated, but considering _all_ of their other possessions, including clothes, are confiscated, it is implied that they smuggled it in someplace that wasn't searched....
-   _Fear & Hunger: Termina_: Failing the Poe's coin flip attack sees it inflict one of these on the player, slamming them onto the floor before repeatedly ramming one of its hands up your backside.
-   In _Fighter Maker_ for the Play Station, It's possible to create a long and intricate _fatality_ attack that ends with a deadly _kancho_.
-   This is implied to have happened in an early scene in _Final Fantasy IX_ when Steiner inspects a large barrel by poking it with his sword, only for Zidane to pop out howling in pain.
-   In _Guilty Gear_ one of Faust's overdrives has him do this to his opponent using his oversized scalpel. The vocal responses he gets out of them are rather comical at times (Such as Chipp's "OH YEAH!").
    -   In _Xrd -SIGN-_ he switches to using a typical kancho... and the overdrive is now cinematic, allowing the players to witness the comical facial expressions of his victims.
-   In _Hypnospace Outlaw_, Counselor Ronnie warns teens about a new recreational drug, T-Nubs, that is taken as a suppository. Ronnie is an Invented Individual, and T-Nubs don't actually exist. The _Plus_ DLC adds a minigame, _Drug Runners_, where Ronnie has to escape from drug dealers who are trying to "shonk" him.
-   At one point in _Knights of the Old Republic_, the player character runs into a prisoner who says he'll give you a hacker's tool if he's freed. You can ask him how he has it—wasn't he searched?—and he tells you that they did, but they didn't search _everywhere_. The player character can then choose to be either Squicked or pragmatic.
-   _Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out!_: Let's just say Larry doesn't know what a High Colonic Treatment is.
-   In _MadWorld_, the Dummied Out execution for Jude the Dude has Jack take his revolvers, jam them up his ass and reaming him before firing him up into the air.
-   _Marvel: Avengers Alliance_ has an enemy attack called "Where the Sun Don't Shine", though the sprite animation (thankfully) is just a generic attack.
-   Used as a possible solution in a disturbing amount of puzzles in _McPixel._ Actual success rate of this solution varies.
-   In the pre-fight dialogue between Sonya Blade and Erron Black in _Mortal Kombat X_, Sonya threatens to do this to him _with her gun_.
-   In _Pillars of Eternity_ you can threaten a guard at a drug den with this if your Resolve is high enough.
    
    **Watcher:** \[Resolve 14\] Get out of my way or I'll break your sword in half and feed it to you at both ends.
    
-   Like its anime counterpart, Croagunk in _Pokkén Tournament_ kanchos both its trainer for the heck of it, (which you can experience in first person before some matches) and its opponents.
-   The _Postal 2_ Expansion Pack _Apocalypse Weekend_ has this as a possibility in one of its levels where the Postal Dude is running around smashing cow heads with a sledgehammer. It's possible to throw said hammer at the cows as well. If it hits the front, it kills them. But if it hits the back, the hammer... erm... gets stuck. At which point you can _pull it out of the paralyzed cow's anus_. Making matters worse is the audible \*pop\* when you retrieve it.
    
    **The Dude:** Geez. Those things are like black holes!
    
    -   Not to mention how, in the base game, the Dude can _stick his guns up cats' buttholes to use as makeshift silencers_.
-   Another Rareware example; in _Banjo-Kazooie_, one of the tasks in Mad Monster Mansion is to take a Jiggy from Napper, a sleeping ghost, without waking him up. Once you successfully get the Jiggy, this exchange occurs between Napper and Grunty:
    
    **Napper:** Grunty's gold, how it shone, she'll be mad, now it's gone!  
    **Grunty:** Yes I'm mad, my boot I'll put, up your useless spooky butt!
    
-   The _Ratchet & Clank_ series is quite fond of innuendos. The third game in the series is actually named _Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal_, after all.
    -   This bit from the opening of _Ratchet: Deadlocked_, when Al activates the speech function on Ratchet's new armor:
        
        **Ratchet:** Let me _outta_ this thing you Blarg-headed frack monkey! I can barely breathe and my tail feels like it's shoved right up my—! _\-speech function cuts off-_
        
-   In _Resident Evil: Outbreak_ the characters seemingly pull out items out of and put in the same items in and out their rectums depending if they are storing or taking out.
-   Turn your enemies around and propel them into orbit, by shoving the Alien Anal Probe up their butts in _Saints Row IV_.
-   _Salt and Sanctuary_: Sometimes you may end up behind a Split Swordsman who has fallen to his knee after being parried, and the result of a backstab can be this.
-   The Headless miniboss in _Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice_ has this as one of its most dangerous attack. If it lands the hit, it'll take out a huge chunk of Sekiro's health as it rips out his _shirikodama_ (a mythical organ located in the anus that contains the human soul).
-   The player can use an "Ass Shove" execution in _Shank 2_.
-   In the fighting game _Skullgirls_, Cerebella has the kancho version of this trope as a move.
-   In _South Park: The Fractured but Whole_, two of your Buddy Powers used to clear through obstacles involves shoving things up your ass. Toolshed's power, "Sandblaster", has you hooking his sandblaster up to your ass to power it with your farts while Professor Chaos's power, "Haywire", has him shove one of his hamster minions up your ass so you can use your farts to fire it at electronic locks and short them out. Rebecca also threatens to do this to the New Kid in her intro.
-   In _South Park: The Stick of Truth_, Mr. Slave is a summon who can one-shot enemies by shoving them into his ass.
    -   Taken to extreme lengths when the New Kid has to shrink down and journey into Mr. Slave's ass to defuse a Snuke. Inside, you'll find a number of semen blockages, a condom, an iPhone with an incoming call from Big Gay Al, a flashlight, a vibrator, a live bat, a rodent skeleton, anal beads, Mr. Hat, two armed guards protecting the snuke that the government agents placed inside Mr. Slave's ass, along with the snuke itself, and of course, the spirits of the Frog King, the Sparrow Prince, and the Catatafish. You can also somehow summon Mr. Slave to shove your enemies into his ass _while you are inside his ass_, however that works. Doing so gets you the "Inside Joke" achievement.
-   Subverted in _Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow_: In a late-game mission, you have to get a USB drive from a guy, who has been taken hostage. When you get to him and take it you can say "Where were you keeping this? It might be good to know." His response: "Not where you think I had it. I just have experience hiding things."
    -   Implied in the first mission in the same game, however, where you get a storage device from a hostage, and when Sam asks how he hid it, he says to "just wash your hands when you're done with it."
-   _S.T.A.L.K.E.R._:
    -   Mentioned in the very first mission the player takes when you have to obtain a Flash drive off of a captured Stalker. When questioned where he hid it, he claims "I didn't hide it down _there,_ so don't worry." Also, when stalkers sitting around campfires begin to play guitar, the way in which they get the guitar out can raise players' eyebrows. It appears out of thin air and they pull downwards, and it sure did not come from their backpack. Sure, it's hammerspace, but still.
-   Implied in _Star Wars: Republic Commando_ where you get these lines:
    
    **Boss:** Did they find the data?  
    **Scorch:** No, I hid it pretty well.  
    **Boss:** Where, exactly?  
    **Scorch:** Mmmm, you don't wanna know.  
    **Boss:** Roger that.
    
-   Chun-Li seemingly reaches into her strongest butt in the world in _Street Fighter V_ Shadow Falls to grab the MacGuffin to show to Cammy.
-   _Tales of Monkey Island_:
    -   Near the end of Chapter 5, while Morgan stabs LeChuck after Guybrush has trapped him, Elaine gives the villain one by stabbing him with the Cutlass of Kaflu... let's just say... _right in the fundament_! And this is an E10+ rated game, too!
    -   Previously subverted near the end of Chapter 1: when the player tries to use the ancient weather vane on De Singe while he's in the messed up idol, Guybrush will say, "Oh, I'd love to, but I'm pretty sure that De Singe doesn't have the necessary... slots."
-   _Tales of the Abyss_: In the scene before the final battle with Van, Anise makes this comment:
    
    **Anise:** We're gonna take the Commandant's ideals and shove them up his ass!
    
-   Mentioned by a few of _Team Fortress 2's_ characters.
    
    **Demoman:** _(to Engineer)_ You come wide at me again, boy, I'll stick that wrench right up yer arse!  
    **Demoman:** _(to Engineer again)_ Go on and build more o' yer little guns. I'll shove every one of them up yer arse!  
    **Soldier:** Merasmus! I am going to pull a rabbit out of your ass!  
    **Soldier:** _(to Medic)_ I'm gonna mail my boot to the Kaiser with your ass around it!  
    **Soldier (to Administrator):** Then I guess you'd better take me to the gravel pit and **shoot me**, lady. 'Cause if you ever ask me to kill my friend again, I will put my **boot so far up your ass** it will be on the **news**.  
    **Soldier (to Merasmus):** Tonight, your ass will be visited by three ghosts: my foot, my other foot, and a ghost!

    **Butch:** In fact... I'm continuing the tradition, baby!
    
-   _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_: This is apparently Marneus Calgar's go-to threat when Cato Sicarius is getting too annoying, notable in that he threatens to shove his _Power Fist_ up his ass.

Because, you know, his ass will be in ruins.

    **White Mage:** "This hammer will be introduced to your anatomy in a way that is neither comfortable nor sanitary. The White Mage's oath forbids me from speaking further on this matter, but consider it a guarantee that you will taste splinters for a week when I'm through with you. However, that very same oath precludes me from enacting this extremely warranted if invasive act until I have made every effort to save the lives of those still trapped in the debris."

-   _Schlock Mercenary_:
    
    -   In the 2001 Schlocktoberfest epilogue, it's stated that the smuggler that brought the diamond-beetle eggs aboard the _Princess Tyola_ as a suppository.
    -   Action Girl Elf once treated a reality TV host to this trope with one of his own cameras.
    
    -   To handle the toxic atmosphere of Ghanj-Rho when the Toughs were going on a mission to get a new set of eyes for Schlock, they are given with a device to filter the toxins out of their blood. They're not, unlike one grunt thought, to be swallowed...
-   _Shortpacked!_'s take on this trope is extremely... well, just go see it.
-   _Something\*Positive_:
    -   Mike and the Redneck Trees. While nothing actually happened, it was only because Peejee allowed her conscience to get the better of her and put a stop to things; otherwise, the audience is led to believe Davan and company would indeed have gone there. So to speak.
    -   Also mentioned when Davan goes to the doctor and refuses a rectal thermometer.
        
        "I'm not an infant. I'm a grown man who thinks his doctor should be able to check his temperature in other ways, like the forehead, ear, or, and this may seem novel, under the tongue."  
        "Whatever you say, boy, but you're the first person to ask me to stick a rectal thermometer in his mouth."

-   _Trigger Star_:
-   _Unsounded_: The prostitute Bastion is seeing gets pissed when he reveals he didn't bring any money since he can't take anything with him while offsetting. She yells at him to shove his wallet up his rear then, and he replies he's tried that; it just falls out when he shifts.
-   _The Wheel of Time_ fan comic _WoT Now?_ has this as a running joke. The first instance is Mat getting his \[literal\] staff shoved up his arse; it reaches its pinnacle when Rahvin _gets a battleship shoved up there_.

-   _Adventure Time_:
    -   In "To Cut a Woman's Hair", a balding Tree Witch captures Jake and threatens to shove him up her "bottomless bottom" if Finn doesn't get her some beautiful hair with which to make a wig.
    -   In "Incendium", while contacting BMO to check in on Finn if he's cheered up, Jake gets a good view of BMO about to kancho him. Finn didn't take it well, especially considering BMO used both of his hands.
-   _The Amazing World of Gumball_ has some, mostly involving Alan the balloon and his balloon knot.
    -   In "The Decisions", he takes in a whole eggplant up there, with another character pointing out he was talking the whole time, not using his mouth to eat.

    -   There's the infamous episode where a joke was made about sticking a live firecracker up a cat's behind, which caused so much outcry that MTV was forbidden from airing it again. Clearly, the fact that they thought it went too far was saying a lot, given the type of humor this show is famous for.
    -   In "Huh Huh Humbug" (the show's rendition of Yet Another Christmas Carol), Buzzcut (playing the Ghost of Christmas Future) threatens to do this to Beavis (filling out the Scrooge role), by promising he'll resort to sticking a Christmas tree where "the sun don't shine" if he doesn't change his ways.
-   This is taken to ridiculous proportions in _Celebrity Deathmatch_ in the match between Lucy Lawless and Calista Flockheart. An accident in the fight has Callista wind up with her head up Lucy's butt, at which point, after a few minutes of struggling, Lucy is able to completely "absorb" Callista into her body through that end of her. This somehow causes Callista to end up in her womb, which results in Lucy, at the end of the episode, giving birth to Callista as she would a newborn daughter.
-   In _Cracké_, Ed ends up sliding right up a rhino's rear in "Factory".
-   In the John Dilworth short _The Dirdy Birdy_, one of the ways Fergurina retaliates to Purdy mooning her is by shoving a helium pump up his ass. After inflating his buttcheeks, she then pops them with a safety pin.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   In "Stewie Loves Lois", Peter gets his first ever prostate exam and thinks he got raped.
    -   At least two Winnie the Pooh-related cutaway gags use this as part of the gag. In "Road To the North Pole," Pooh finds out that Eeyore is a grouch all the time because "I have a nail in my anus." In "Saturated Fat Guy," Pooh – when lodged in the door to Rabbit's house (after overeating) notices what feels like a fist up his rear and, when commenting about why Rabbit isn't using his shoulder for leverage, is told, "Don't worry about it!"
    -   Another episode involves Quagmire returning from a vacation in Mexico with a large number of "illegal" fireworks smuggled in up his rectum...even though fireworks aren't illegal in Rhode Island.
    -   Quagmire also claims to do this with carrots; it's best not to ask why.
    -   The episode "Barely Legal" has yet another example involving Quagmire: when he, Peter, and Cleveland go to the police academy, the first lesson is on doing cavity searches, with Peter as the police officer and Quagmire as the suspect. Among the many, _many_ things inside Quagmire's rectum are a cellphone, a doorknob, a wedge of cheese, a wind-up toy car, a fish (which, judging by its flopping around after hitting the ground, _was still alive),_ a DVD copy of _Good Burger_, and a xylophone, complete with mallet.
        
        **Peter:** I... think that's everything.  
        **Bruce:** You want me to double-check?
        
    -   When Stewie is preparing to compete in a tennis tournament, he declares that he knows exactly where he's going to put the 1st place trophy. Cut to two doctors looking at his X-ray after he apparently died shoving the trophy up his ass (he doesn't actually die for that episode).
    -   In the "Fellas at the Frickin' FCC" musical number, Stewie responds to the mention of the FCC sending a warning to your mailbox by remarking that he can think of quite another place they should've stuck it first. While he's saying this, he is shown to have made a sculpture around the mailbox the warning letter has been inserted, which makes it all the more obvious that Stewie meant they can shove it up their asses.
    -   According to Mort, he had pine cones shoved up his ass by other kids during his youth.
    -   When Peter lost his memory, he tried to give Stewie a diaper change and stuck the new diaper up his ass, traumatizing him.
    -   In "Peter's Two Dads", Peter, as "Pee-Pants the Inebriated Hobo Clown", accidentally crushes Francis while riding a unicycle, then tells Lois to call an ambulance for each of them because the unicycle got lodged in his ass.
-   _Father of the Pride_: In "Sarmoti Moves In", Sarmoti hides his poker winnings in the rectum of his zebra rug.
-   _Futurama_
    -   "The Deep South":
        -   Professor Farnsworth presents Fry with an enormous egg-sized pill.
            
            **Fry:** I can't swallow that!  
            **Farnsworth:** Well, then good news! It's a suppository!
            
        -   Later in the same episode:
            
            **Farnsworth:** Before we go out, has everyone taken their pressure pill?  
            **Amy:** _(Annoyed look)_ Yes. Stop asking.
            
        -   Referenced later still, when the crew is introduced to a more efficient nose-plug-based method of breathing underwater:
            
            **Farnsworth:** This is uncomfortable and humiliating! Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository...
            
    -   Also, "Parasites Lost":
        
        **Zoidberg:** I'm going to have to take a look inside you with this camera.  
        _(Fry opens his mouth.)_  
        **Zoidberg:** Guess again.
        
    -   Later in the same episode Fry decides to confront the parasites using a microscopic robot duplicate that goes inside his own body. He inserts the robot by dropping it down the back of his underpants.
    -   From "Xmas Story" when Fry tries to placate a homicidal Santa robot with milk and cookies:
        
        **Santa:** You dare bribe _Santa?_ I'm gonna shove coal so far up your stocking you'll be coughing up diamonds!
        
    -   From "Law and Oracle" as Crazy Roberto makes demands of the cops while holding the Planet Express Crew at knifepoint.
        
        **Roberto:** Listen up piggies! I want a hover-copter, and an unmarked sandwich, and a new face with like, uh, a Hugh Grant look! And every five minutes I don't get it, someone's gonna get STABBED IN THE AASSSS!  
        **Zoidberg:** He's bluffing. _(Slicing sound)_ Aahh! He's not bluffing!
        
    -   In "Lethal Inspection", Bender demonstrates his built-in pencil sharpener, which is located exactly where you expect. The owner of the pencil immediately picks it up with a pair of tongs and throws it into a furnace.

-   In _Johnny Test_, the titular protagonist gets a suppository shot up him in "Johnny Testosterone" as a last-ditch solution to undo him being Hulk-like.
-   _Kaeloo_:
    -   In the episode "Let's Play Treasure Hunt", Kaeloo sets up a fun game of treasure hunt for Stumpy and Quack Quack with the promise of a "surprise" at the end. Mr. Cat changes the clues to make the game so they get injured. In the end, Kaeloo gives them the "surprise" she had promised, and it turns out to be a photo of herself. Stumpy decides to shove it up his ass just to spite her, but she stops him before he does.
    -   In another episode, Stumpy sticks a pencil up his butt because he thinks it's funny. To his chagrin, nobody else finds it amusing.
-   _King of the Hill_ had an episode where a doctor inserts a camera into Hank's anus to check for an intestinal blockage. Hank is humiliated, but nobody else understands what the big deal is. Also, it is implied that Dale's constipation remedy using bacon grease (which Hank reluctantly tries later) involves doing this with it.
-   In episode 8 of Season 2 of _The Legend of Vox Machina_, a de-powered and cursed Grog needs to receive a huge magical suppository in order to recover. Since he's too weak to do it himself, Scanlan volunteers to do it for him.
    -   In order to bypass the dragon Umbrasyll's Acidic Breath, Scanlan proposes they enter through the other way. Cue Scanlan's magic hand carrying him and Vax in position to make a prostate check, flying straight towards Umbrasyll's cloaca.
-   _Looney Tunes Cartoons_ has Sylvester go up an elephant's rear in _RHINO ya DON'T_.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ has a subtle one in _Feeling Pinkie Keen_ where Twilight rescues Spike from being Hydra lunch by putting him up on her head before running away. As it so happens, she's a unicorn, and unlike a similar maneuver earlier in the episode, her horn is not seen bent to the side, and Spike looks none too comfortable as his upper body and limbs jiggle, but his butt stays firmly in place.
    -   Troubleshoes also has a cactus enter where the sun don't shine in _Appleoosa's Most Wanted_ as the climax of a string of slapstick mishaps in his house.
-   _My Little Pony: Pony Life_ features multiple instances of Hammerspace storage conspicuously using the butt near the tail base on ponies not wearing pants:
    -   The first time, in _The Fluttershy Effect_, is the most blatant, as before Rainbow Dash pulls out a tablet about the size of her torso out seemingly from her butt, it makes a notification noise with _visible sound indicators to say it's inside her butt_.
    -   _The Rarity Report_ features two nearly back-to-back, with first DJ PON3 pulling a vinyl record out from seemingly between her cheeks, and then Rarity pulling a microphone out from below her tail, conveniently obscured by a TV news overlay.
-   _The Penguins of Madagascar_ has quite a bit of butt humor, and King Julien seems to be the literal butt monkey of these particular kinds of it:
    -   In "The Big Squeeze", Cloud Cuckoolander King Julien mentions how happy he is not to be a mammal when the mammals start disappearing. In order to verify his warm-blooded nature, Kowalski produces a thermometer from Hammerspace and briefly moves it under the table before yanking it back out. Julien's expression makes it abundantly clear what's going on.
    -   King Julien tries to catapult himself into a penguin party, but ends up going in Roy the rhino's butt in "Action Reaction".
    -   Later in the same episode, Julien tries digging his way up to the party, but finds himself under Roy, who promptly sits down. The flashlight on Julien's helmet shines out Roy's eyes.
    -   In "The Terror of Madagascar", Julien for once does this on purpose, going up Burt the elephant's butt and immediately out his mouth to escape through a window Burt's head was sticking out of. Burt is, of course, disgusted by this.
-   Happens twice in the _Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"_ episode "Altruists". The first is Ren accidentally shoving his finger into Stimpy's ass while they were performing their routine beatings, and the second happens when Ren intentionally pushed a tile in between Stimpy's buttcheeks.
-   _Rick and Morty_:
    -   In the first episode, Rick asks Morty to hide some alien tree seeds "all the way up" his butt to get them through customs because Rick has done the same so many times that the seeds would just fall out. The plan hits an immediate snag when the customs agents proudly show off their newest scanning device: "It detects stuff _all the way_ up your butt!"
    -   In "Look Who's Purging Now", while Rick and Arthricia are brutally murdering the rich people who arrange the Festival every year, Rick puts a rocket in one guy's ass, sending him a short distance before it explodes and gibs him.

    -   Implied, but not executed, later in the episode: Rocko crams a gigantic pill down his throat, though he's still not feeling well. He checks the label on the back of the pill's container, which reads... "Warning: Not to be taken orally".

-   _The Simpsons_: In the episode "Sweets and Sour Marge", after sugar is banned in Springfield, Homer and Bart get a team together to smuggle sugar into the city. Before they dock at the harbour with their boat full of sugar, Homer asks if everyone has keistered (slang for concealing contraband in your ass) their personal supply and gets squicked-out looks from the others. He picks up on this and says that he sure hasn't.
-   _South Park_: Considering that this show is known for its adult-oriented usage of Toilet Humour, it should be no surprise that this comes up every now and again:
    -   The premiere episode, "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", culminates with a 50-foot satellite dish emerging from Cartman's ass.
    -   "Canceled" shows the return of the said satellite, having it emerge and retract again:
        
        **Kyle:** Are you all right?  
        **Cartman:** You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up your ass? NO, I'M NOT ALL RIGHT!

    -   In "Spy Buddies," after SpongeBob is done talking to Mr. Krabs using Patrick's telephone pants, the pants tell him "If you would like to make a call, please deposit 25 cents," to which SpongeBob responds by pulling out a quarter.
    -   A small gag in "Goodbye, Krabby Patty?" involves Squidward pretending to be an animatronic to keep his job at the Krusty Krab Museum. A repair man comes in and bends him over so that his butt is up in the air. He then pulls out a drill, and the painful screams from off-screen fill in the blanks.
-   _Teen Titans (2003)_: In "X", when Red X returns, the Titans want to make sure that Robin (who was Red X before) is really himself and not some kind of trick. After Starfire establishes he's not a hologram, they consider a cavity search to rule out other possibilities:
    
    **Beast Boy:** He could still be a robot. Check him for batteries.  
    **Cyborg:** _(Snaps on a rubber glove, raises index finger, and wiggles arm.)_  
    **Robin:** _(Horrified)_ Wait! Please! It wasn't me this time! I promise!
    
-   _The Venture Bros._
