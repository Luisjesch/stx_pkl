_Got bit  
Fever hit  
World gone to Shit  
Might as well quit_

Whatever the reason (a guilty conscience, the world is simply too much to bear, self-hatred, whether reasonable or unreasonable, a belief that they're facing A Fate Worse Than Death, or simply having seen some really weird shit), a character may be driven to take their own life. This may be as little as pondering their existence or as much as holding a gun to one's head. Most times, the character will have second thoughts, or will be talked down by a friend, but in shows where Anyone Can Die, the character may go through with it. In any case, this is a powerful way to underscore the desperation of the character. In a Backstory, being Driven To Suicide can illuminate the character's Dark and Troubled Past. On desperate occasions, this can be a happy ending, but only if a majority of the viewers agree, and this is very rare.

In some cases, the reason for suicide may not be depression, but honor, as with ritual suicide. This is obviously more common in Japanese works (as in Japanese culture, traditionally suicide can be done to cleanse one's honor) than in Western ones (as in most Christian sects, suicide traditionally is a shameful act — but classical settings allow it to be presented as honourable, e.g. in Shakespeare). It was also accepted by various ancient Greek philosophies, particularly that of the Stoics, as well as the ancient Romans and Egyptians, both of whom lauded it as a dignified and timely alternative to illness, dementia, or disgrace. Some Proud Warrior Races, such as the nomadic Scythians, preferred suicide as an alternative to dying in bed, thus making this trope Older Than Feudalism. By contrast, Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, et al.) abhor suicide, believing that only God is permitted to say when a life may be ended — however, there is considerable debate over issues like euthanasia, capital punishment, and killing in war.

Sometimes this is done to deliver An Aesop about teen suicide by having Long-Lost Uncle Aesop show up in a Very Special Episode.

At the other extreme, victims of The Corruption, Compelling Voice, or other forms of compulsion may resort to this to prevent the monster they are about to become from being unleashed on the world. This may allow Dying as Yourself.

This is regularly played for laughs, despite the risk of falling into "Dude, Not Funny!" territory. Also incidentally, deliberately pushing someone into suicide is treated the same as premeditated first-degree murder in many countries. For example, grave bullying (at school or elsewhere) can, unfortunately, result in the victim going to very great lengths to escape it.

Subtrope of Murder by Suicide. Super-Trope to Leave Behind a Pistol. Sister Trope to Psychic-Assisted Suicide, Ordered to Die, Tricked to Death, and Suicidal Sadistic Choice.

See also: I Cannot Self-Terminate, Suicide by Cop, Suicide by Sea, Ate His Gun, Barefoot Suicide, Bath Suicide, Better to Die than Be Killed, Goodbye, Cruel World!, Gayngst-Induced Suicide, Suicide by Sunlight, Murder-Suicide and Mid-Suicide Regret.

Contrast Bungled Suicide and Interrupted Suicide, where the character's attempt fails or is stopped by somebody else; Happily Failed Suicide, where the character is grateful to be alive after all; Mistaken for Suicidal, where a character is mistakingly thought to be suicidal when they're not; Accidental Suicide where a character kills themself but had _zero_ intention of doing so; and Suicide Is Painless, where the character has no reason to kill themself, but does so anyway. Also contrast Seppuku, a form of suicide usually associated with Samurai, which is done to retain honor if all other choices mean violating it. Not to be confused with Too Dumb to Live, where a character makes a decision stupid enough to _un_intentionally lead to their own death.

Tragically, this is an all too common occurrence in Real Life, but due to the _extremely_ sensitive nature of this trope and the fact we'd have WAY too many cases, please do not add real life examples.

## As this is a Death Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

    Art 

-   In the last painting of _Marriage A-la-Mode_, already ashamed of having brought about her husband's death in a duel, the Countess is broken completely by the news that Silvertongue has been hanged at Tyburn for the crime. She poisons herself with laudanum which she has bribed a dim-witted manservant (the man in the loose-fitting, incorrectly-buttoned coat) to buy for her. Since this makes what remains of the Earl's money forfeit to the state, the only money her father can get back from her dowry is from selling her wedding ring, which he is busy removing.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Funky Winkerbean_: The fall of 2019 brought a weeks-long Story Arc concerning Bull Bushka going through advancing symptoms of a dementia-type syndrome (which will be explained is chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE), of which he seeks treatment but his health insurer refuses to pay for. With his condition worsening (and knowing he'll eventually be rendered into a dementia-type vegetative state; he's already suffered from severe headaches that he can't get rid of) and knowing that he and his wife will be bankrupted (and worse) if he gets treatment ... Bull takes to what he decides is his only option. One night, he puts on his football helmet and goes for a drive, eventually (deliberately) driving his car through a guardrail and crashing into a deep ravine; he is killed on impact. Bull's suicide reflected research by _Funky Winkerbean_ author Tom Bautik of athletes (most of them football) who had in real life taken their own lives due to symptoms later attributed to CTE; the storyline would be the focus of several major newspaper articles and be a feature article in the magazine _Sports Illustrated_.

    Fairy Tales 

-   In _Bearskin_, when the hero, appalling shaggy, filthy and ragged, but rich, rescues a man from financial distress, the man promises that he may marry one of his daughters. Only the youngest is willing. However, his appearance stemmed from a Deal with the Devil, and that being over, he cleans up nicely, and the older sisters are reduced to envy and commit suicide. The Devil exults to the hero that he has got two souls instead of the one.
-   In _The Blue Mountains_, the hero despairs of finding the princess, and goes to kill himself with the sword she left him.
-   In "The Little Mermaid", the mermaid chooses death over killing the prince and reverting to mermaid form.
-   "Sweetheart Roland" has the title character forget about his lover, the story's heroine. So she turns herself into a flower in the hopes that somebody would trample on her.
-   In _The Young Slave_, the heroine is so badly abused that she contemplates suicide. Fortunately, her uncle hears her lamenting her woes and saves her.
    
    _She began to weep, and wail, and lament, telling that inanimate piece of wood the story of her travails, speaking as she would have done to a living being; and perceiving that the doll answered not, she took up the knife and sharpening it on the pumice-stone, said, 'If thou wilt not answer me, I shall kill myself, and thus will end the feast;' and the doll swelled up as a bag-pipe, and at last answered, 'Yes, I did hear thee, I am not deaf._'
    

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Kung Fu Chicken Noodle, seen in Kaiju Big Battel, is the result of a suicide attempt gone wrong. He _eventually_ became a hero though.
-   Samuel Shaw tried to commit suicide in TNA when he realized Christie Hemme, whom he had been stalking, did not share his affections. This eventually lead to him being put in a padded cell.

    Radio 

-   There's a sort of joking, Continuity Nod version in the Big Finish Doctor Who story _Caerdroia_. The Doctor, dealing with an Obstructive Bureaucrat, says that he's going to go take a couple of aspirin. It was once stated that aspirin is poison to Time Lords. Without knowing that, it sounds as though he's merely, and quite reasonably, complaining of a headache, as he's just been asked to refer his question of whether anyone in the building can help him to the Rhetorical or Genuine Questions Office, but it's actually more akin to an exasperated finger-gun\-to-the-head gesture.

    Roleplays 

-   After Lin Mao, the man who arranged Hua Yin's Career-Ending Injury in _The Dao of the Awakened_, is made to suffer the same fate, he jumps off a roof.
-   In _The Gamer's Alliance_, Marya finally cracks when she becomes guilt-ridden by all the bad things she's done and commits suicide in order to atone for her sins and be reunited with her husband Kagetsu in the afterlife.
-   Many characters in _Survival of the Fittest_ choose to commit suicide rather than kill their classmates or allow themselves to be killed. The most memorable of these is probably River Garraty, who was the first one to kill themselves by _intentionally running into a danger zone_. In v3, there have been six intentional suicides; Tegan Bianco, Keiji Tanaka, Anna Grout, Bobby Jacks, Gabe McCallum and Quincy Archer. Three other characters killed themselves by accident.
    -   Recently in v4, Dawne Jiang commits suicide by remaining in a dangerzone after it has been announced as such. Hermione Miller and Violetta Lindsberg also commit suicide by pulling on their collars.
        -   Maria Graham attempts suicide by trying to slash her own throat with a shard of broken glass. Fortunately, one of her friends shows up just in time to stop her.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Anathema_, shrouds with the dominion of Despair can drive others to suicide, even if that person was perfectly fine before.
    -   If a shroud has the primary dominion of Despair, it means that their husk committed suicide.
-   One of the Deathlords in _Exalted_, during his first life as a Solar Exalted, was inducted into a Circle (adventuring party) to replace their lost member, who had carried the same Shard. After enduring a decade of them demonstrating why the Solars ended up being overthrown, he killed himself. Then, after spending a fair while as a brooding ghost, the rest of them managed what he saw as a Karma Houdini...so now he wants to destroy all life.
-   This is roughly how Cataphractoi are created in _Princess: The Hopeful_.
-   In the origin story for the _Ravenloft_ setting, grieving bride Tatyana throws herself from the clifftop castle wall, rather than be turned into a vampire by her fiance's murderous brother, Strahd von Zarovich. Strahd's karmic punishment as a Darklord is to continue driving Tatyana's reincarnations to suicide (or be otherwise directly or indirectly responsible for her death) again and again as the only thing he truly wants - her - keeps slipping from his grasp.
-   For a while in _Warhammer 40,000_ it was possible for a Commissar of the Imperial Guard to execute himself. This was quickly patched in the Codex's FAQ.

    Toys 

-   Animula's backstory involves this in _Little Apple Dolls_. In order to avoid losing his wife, her father have her to a warlord prior to her birth. On her seventh birthday the warlord came for her. The little girl was made to live in a cage, however a fox came along and helped her. The fox told her that the warlord was going to give her milk that would turn her into a demon, so Animula was given eggs in order to protect her. It turns out the fox was really the warlords' jealous wife, who was attempting to kill the girl herself. After deciding she can never escape, the child ended up drinking both the allegedly poisonous milk and eating the bad eggs.
-   Abnormal Cyrus' original backstory in _Teddy Scares_, a toyline of undead teddy bears, was that his loneliness drove him to hang himself.

    -   In the first _Very Off Parents_ short, a child worker jumps off a roof in order to escape her job.
-   _Battle for Dream Island_ has examples that are mostly Played for Laughs, like Bubble popping herself to prove a point and Yellow Face dying on command. However, in BFB 28, it's more serious. When the Announcer returns, he takes the show from Four to run the finale, but rather then leave, Four merges with the Earth, seemingly permanently, to stay on as a "constant presence". However, one of the writers says they're fine.
    
    _(Laughing demonically)_ _**WAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I'LL BE HERE FOREVER!!!**_
    
-   According to _Bowser's Kingdom_ episode 10, Lemmy Koopa was driven to suicide because of a mediocre review of the show.
    
    **Hal:** Hmm, well let's check out this review.  
    **Jeff:** Lemonater said it was good, but need plot and character development. It was good, but it's not the Fresh Prince.  
    **Hal:** Little did we know that poor Lemmy idolised the Fresh Prince. He's always tried to be like Will Smith and tried his best. He was good... just not Fresh Prince good. _(sighs)_ I miss you Lemmy... _(sniff)_ I miss you...  
    _(Shot of Lemmy hanging himself)_
    
-   General Briggs in the final chapter of _Broken Saints_.
-   In _COPS: Skyrim_. One scene has Officer Jenkins suggesting this while listening to an old woman's story during an anger management class. Played for Laughs:
    
    "Could somebody _please_ draw my sword and chop my head off? I'll give you everything I own. I'm serious, how could you have not killed yourself by now, lady? That's the most depressing story I've ever heard and she hasn't even covered the _teen years_ yet!"

-   In _Mario Brothers_, the ending has this. Mario stops running and lets the lava overtake him.
-   Germaine from _Neurotically Yours_ attempts suicide fairly regularly. In one of earliest episodes, she stands with a gun to her head while Foamy relentlessly mocks her lack of resolution and reasons for putting the gun to her head. It's implied that she ends up shooting Foamy. "Almost Serious Suicide".
-   _On The Edge_:
-   _Revenge Films_:
-   _RWBY_:
    -   Salem was made immortal as a punishment for attempting to overthrow the gods. She tried stabbing herself with a sword but couldn't kill herself.
    -   Throughout the series, the heroes constantly go through trauma and loss. While many of them eventually overcome their trauma and become better people as a result, one of them has bear a heavier burden by leading them all and eventually resorts to a form of suicide as a result. Throughout Volume 9, protagonist Ruby Rose struggles to cope with the results of her actions across the series and the deaths that happened throughout. When she is trapped in the Ever After, the stress of it all eventually causes her to lash out at her friends and abandon them. When Neopolitan attempts to get her to drink the tea made from a leaf from the Great Tree in the Ever After in order to "ascend", she uses copies of people from her life that had died in order to break her both mentally and physically. What finally causes her to drink it and "ascend" however is witnessing Neo smashing her heel on Little just as her friends arrived to watch her drink it. The final two episodes deal with the fact that her friends and teammates uncertain if the Ruby that comes back from ascension will be the same Ruby or not. Thankfully, Ruby recognizes after landing in the Blacksmith's domain that she didn't truly wish to die, comes to remember to accept herself for who she is after seeing the truth behind Summer Rose's disappearance and returns back to her friends' side with a greater certainty in herself.
-   The Stories of Sodor: In "Revenge", Robert's mother did this after her family's house was foreclosed.

    Websites 

-   Cracked released this article exploring the ramifications of suicide for you, and the people around you. While littered with Cracked's standard brand of humour, it does make some valid points. If you are reading this page and considering suicide, please _please_ at least take the time to read the article first.
-   In _NFL Quarterbacks On Facebook_, the citizens of Cleveland, as well as Browns Fans, would kill themselves after being reminded about the Baltimore Ravens's successes following their move in 1996, especially after winning two Super Bowls.
-   _SCP Foundation_:
-   In _Serina_, this is the implied final fate of Retally, a woolly wumpo of the Tidelands herd. He attains a Pyrrhic Victory by using fire to drive away the invading thalassic gravediggers, but unfortunately, he hasn't mastered the fire, and this results in nearly the entire Tidelands herd burning to death. Retally is consumed by guilt over the deaths of his herdmates, and heads to the cold and hostile northern regions of Serinarcta, never to be seen or heard from again.
-   The Spy, from _Water-Human_, chose to throw himself off a cliff rather than let the Water-Human kill him. In fact, he did this mostly because he was so depressed by how people seemed to constantly die in droves while around the Water-Human.
-   _Zsdav Adventures_: Zig-Zagged in _Kiválasztott 1_ (_Chosen one 1_), it begins with Zsdav walking to a ledge and says this world became "too empty" for him. Freezzy tries to talk him out of it but Zsdav keeps insisitng he has to kill himself.
    
    **Freezzy:** Jump then. _(Punches Zsdav and falls off the ledge)_
    

    Web Videos 

-   _The 15 Experience_: A video of the events in the house was somehow spread to a (fictional) makeup vlogger named Nikki. Something about the video put her into a trance, and she slammed her head into her computer until she died as a result.
-   While _Arby 'n' the Chief_ has been known for its exaggerated view of the online gaming world in its earlier seasons, once its final season drew to its closure, this trope was played both straight and Played for Drama:
    -   First, when Eugene Black kills himself after his sister, the one character that brought him genuine happiness dies of a Brain Hemorrhage, the fact that his dad is a Drunk that physically abuses him for what can be described as on a daily basis, and that his friends have been incapacitated indefinitely and his Master Plan was foiled by two action figures finally pushed him over the edge. Ouch.
    -   A very interesting case of both being averted and deconstructed with Tyler, Eugene's best friend. After learning about Eugene's suicide, he decides to find Arbiter and Master Chief by flying down to where they live and tries to kill them both in a blind fury, with a Chainsaw. He is stopped by a Cop who warns him not enter Jon's room, threatening that he'll be forced to shoot him. This only turns Tyler's attention to him instead...
    -   The titular characters, Arbiter and Master Chief as well. After Arbiter learns that Chief murdered Cortana, had Arbiter's best friend, Greg cover up for him and eventually driven away, and had been keeping this secret from him for nearly 2 months, gone absolutely berserk and literally rips Chief to pieces. While Chief had survived (_barely_) After realizing what he did to Chief and that he had now doomed himself to be all alone for the rest of his existence. Arbiter at first tries to end it all by Jumping out of Jon's Apartment Window, but is stopped by the timely appearance of Claire. Despite Claire's uplifting pep-talk, it doesn't go through to Arbiter and he and Chief come to the conclusion of killing themselves by means of a Gas Explosion. Maybe fans were upset by this sight as the series's Grand Finale, even Jon Graham mentioned on his blog that while he was put off by the reaction to the characters' deaths, he had no other choice. The toys themselves had become so decrepit from filming for so many years that they couldn't last for another season.
-   _The Autobiography of Jane Eyre_: Implied with Mr. Mason. In episode 26 "Mr. Mason", Jane explains what happened the night when mysterious accident number two occurred and Mr. Mason was the one who was seriously injured, and Jane says he apparently hasn't been feeling alright for some time. It's not stated explicitly, but Jane leaves a link to a suicide help web-page in her video description. However, it's probable that Mr Rochester tries to cover up something even more serious.
-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_: In Future Trunks's timeline, Yamcha does this when he finds out Bulma got pregnant with Vegeta's baby. After being told this, Goku manages to prevent it in the main timeline by reminding Yamcha they're friends.
-   Unfortunately, the _Dream SMP_ roleplay is set in a highly unhealthy environment for people with mental health problems, to the point that three/four characters have taken their own lives, or at least actively considered doing so.
    -   By the end of Season 1, Wilbur's mental health spiral culminated in him trying to die in the explosion of Manburg in the Button Room. Even though the plan failed, due to Philza arriving in time to try to talk him down and protect him from the explosion, Wilbur still lost his third canon life after he _begged_ his father to take it. He eventually gets brought back to life in Season 3, and by that point, although he has lost the desire to die after spending over what felt like a decade in a torturous Afterlife, his mental health is still far from stellar.
    -   Throughout Tommy's Exile in Season 2, his mental health took a huge hit and he considered ending himself several times, even engaging in highly self-destructive behaviours. The most notable instance of this occurs at the end of the Exile Arc — after Dream blew up Logstedshire and barred Tommy from going into the Nether or having any visitors, Tommy built a tower hundreds of blocks into the sky, with the clear intention of jumping to his death. He ultimately didn't go through with it after realizing what Dream had been doing to him, but came very close.
    -   After the Doomsday War, Ghostbur asked Tommy to bring him back to life, which basically causes a Death of Personality in Ghostbur. What makes this worse is that Ghostbur is Wilbur's spectral form, and as seen above, _Wilbur himself was technically a suicide victim_.
        -   This is subverted, as the first attempted resurrection of Ghostbur failed and he was Put on a Bus, and decided he doesn't want to be revived ultimately. However, this is exactly what happens when he returns to the server in Season 3 as Tommy recruits his help in attempting to sneak into Pandora's Vault to kill Dream once and for all, and Wilbur is brought Back from the Dead.
    -   Into Season 4, a long history of being felt uncared for has caused Fundy to cut contact with those around him and move far away from the main part of the SMP, setting his respawn point there. While he does accept a heartfelt apology from a revived Wilbur, Fundy says to his face that he doesn't want him in his life anymore, and while Wilbur quickly grows concerned that Fundy was going down "a dangerous path" (of course he'd know), Fundy tells him to leave and throws himself into the ruined crater of L'Manburg when he doesn't.
-   In _Everyman HYBRID_, hidden clips in "Twenty-four months" show an alternate fate for Jeff, with him overdosing on pills depressed over the loss of his girlfriend.
-   _The Final Minutes_: Halfway through the first half of _Zombie Plague_ and shortly after the Prime Minister’s death and subsequent reanimation, the Australian emergency broadcast starts urging those infected to kill themselves as to not give their bodies a chance to reanimate.
-   _Freelance Astronauts_: During the playing of one of the Skulltula Houses in the Let's Play _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_, the repetition and irritating Golden Skulltula noises get to Ferr "tries" to hang himself, but the rafters aren't strong enough, so he fails.
    -   When they encounter a normal Skulltula<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time: Master Quest_:
        
        **Ferr:** Am I going to have to hang myself?  
        **Maxwell Adams:** Eventually, yes.
        
    -   Ferr also claims that he usually just hangs himself during the parts of _The Lord of the Rings_ where there's singing.
-   In _The Guild_, Zaboo tries to hang himself with an ethernet code to escape his overbearing mother (no screenshot, but it happened). This ends up being the killing blow for her. Not that she actually dies, it's just in their fantasy of her as a monster...It Makes Sensein Context.
-   JonTron OD's on Advil and Absolut vodka at the end of the _Hercules Games_ video, feeling the "12 Games of Hercules" aren't worth becoming immortal for.
    -   He hangs himself in dismay in response to Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa killing themselves in a _Lion King_ bootleg game.
    -   He flops over and explodes when _Birdemic_ makes him decide he's "had enough living for one day."
-   _Life SMP:_ Two of the first three seasons invoke this trope with a Last Survivor Suicide:
    -   In 3rd life, Grian wins the Duel to the Death over Scar. After lamenting his hollow victory, he jumps of the cliff right behind where Scar died.
        
        **Rendog:** _(in the in-game chat)_ One more life to go…
        
    -   In Double Life, after reuniting with Pearl, Scott blows himself up using TNT and kills both of them due to their synchronization:
        
        **Scott:** Tilly death do us part, Pearl.  
        **Pearl:** Wait, Scott, what are you doing?  
        **Scott:** TILLY DEATH DO US PART-  
        **Pearl:** Scott! What are you doing?! SCOTT-  
        **Smajor1995 was blown up by Smajor1995**  
        **PearlescentMoon died**
        
-   In _Noob_, Dark Avenger's case was technically a Rage Quit, but it played out as his gaming avatar jumping off a cliff and a friend begging him not to jump beforehand.
-   The Nostalgia Critic takes special precautions to prevent himself from committing suicide when reviewing _Batman & Robin_. Even so, he still sneaks in a cyanide pill and takes it during the review. Someone promptly runs on camera and performs the Heimlich Manuver so he survives.
    -   In many other reviews, after a particularly bad scene, he pulls out a gun and shoots himself in the head, and goes back to reviewing three seconds later.
    -   When Spoony sends Critic a copy of Reb Brown's _Captain America_ film, Critic hangs himself rather than watch the film.
    -   And during _The Pebble and the Penguin_, he goes to take a bath and brings his toaster with him.
    -   Played for Drama in To Boldly Flee, where he admits his Death Seeker intentions to a heartbroken Film Brain. "Return was never an option."
    -   Another critic on the site, Film Brain, sometimes places a gun to his head when things are getting to be too much for him. "Why is it always empty?!"
    -   The Nostalgia Chick pulls a plastic bag over her head and strangles herself after being subjected to "There Must Be An Angel".
    -   Todd in the Shadows has also killed himself with a grocery bag ("BedRock"). He's also beaten himself to death with a book ("Whatcha Say") and committed seppuku ("Like a G6"). He's put a (toy) gun to his head or under his chin a few times as well.
    -   Linkara of _Atop the Fourth Wall_ has attempted this both seriously when he believed he had been one of the parents of the girl who became his gun and...um...not quite so seriously.
        
        **Linkara**: _(sawing at wrist with gun)_ Why doesn't it work?!
        
        -   Also from _Atop the Fourth Wall_, how Linkara defeats The Entity; he drives it mad by pointing out the pointlessness of it's very existence, then posits the question of what happens when an Outer God dies. The Entity is intrigued and self-destructs, freeing all the people it had captured.
    -   In a later episode, the suicide helpline guy mocks her for using suicide helplines so much.
-   In an example very much _not_ played for laughs, Rainer in _Petscop_ is heavily implied to have killed himself immediately after giving Petscop to "The Family".
    
    Fuck you all, and fuck me as well. Check your bathroom now.
    
-   Played for laughs by Jack in-game in two of Rooster Teeth's Let's Plays:
    -   In _Vs._ episode 5, while playing _Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion_, he allows his character, Captain Planet, to fall down a hole, after he found out his special attack ended with an explosion of rainbows and hearts.
    -   In _Let's Play Minecraft_ episode 45, he questions if they have to hop through a circle hole. Ray corrects him by saying it's a square hole. Jack hangs his characters head down and throws him into the lava pit nearby.
-   _SMPLive_: Played for Laughs when Connor defeats AntVenom in the arena. He announces that he can't live with himself and jumps into a pit of lava.
-   Solid jj: In "Mario Learns the Truth", Mario finds out that not only Princess Peach has been sleeping with Bowser, but that his brother and all his friends had already knew and assumed that Mario saving Peach is just part of his elaborate fantasy. Mario reacts to the news by pulling a gun at his head, but he has 99 extra lives and just revives instantly.
-   Subverted in _Spaz Boys Comedy_'s Omegle trolling videos. Latrelle, who is one of the puppets, claimed that he would commit suicide if he didn't get an omegle girlfriend, but he never went through with it because he got one.
-   The Original Spoony One came back from the dead in the _Final Fantasy X_ review. He was ready to kill his clone in order to get his show back. After the clone just gave up the show, Original Spoony realized that he had to review _Final Fantasy X_. He promptly shot himself in the head and became dead. Again.
-   Toad is driven to suicide at the end of _talk my head off_ because he killed so many people.
