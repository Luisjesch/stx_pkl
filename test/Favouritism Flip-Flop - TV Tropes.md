**DJ:** Questions?  
**Chowder:** Yes, umm, are you nuts? I don't wanna steal drugs from my Father, I don't wanna go inside a monster, and I don't wanna die!  
**Jenny:** I say it's worth a shot.  
**Chowder:** Yes I agree. Let's do it.

Bob has a great plan! He tells Charlie about it, but Charlie hates it. That is, until Alice comes along and says that she _loves_ the plan. Charlie instantly switches, telling Alice that he loves the plan too, and they jump to go carry the plan out, whilst Bob stands there, surprised and vaguely insulted.

A slight variation is when Charlie is against the plan until Bob says it's about something Charlie likes, whereupon he's all over it.

Standard quick gag in many series, especially Slice of Life. Subtrope of Opinion Flip-Flop. Compare Glad I Thought of It, where Alice and Charlie are the same character.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Anri from _Sasami: Magical Girls Club_ is like this toward Tsukasa, often showing disdain for things until she sees that Tsukasa is interested, then immediately supporting whatever that thing is.
-   Miko does this in chapter 72 of _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_, ignoring Ishigami when he tells her that her habit of enforcing the rules by ordering everyone around will cause people to stop listening to her, only to immediately agree with Fujiwara's assessment when she says the same thing. Naturally, Ishigami lampshades this.

    Comic Strips 

-   In a _Zits_ comic, Jeremy's mother gives him a fashion suggestion and he complains. Later, his girlfriend gives him the exact same suggestion and he simply says "Okay."

    Films — Animated 

-   _The Croods_: When Eep is about to dive into water, Grug warns her it could be dangerous, which she dismisses because he says that about everything, but when Guy tells her to be careful, she immediately listens without protest. Justified since Grug's overprotective nature makes it hard to tell whether he is right about something being dangerous while Guy being more adventurous and open-minded gives his warning more weight.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In both the 1950 and 1991 versions of _Father of the Bride_, the daughter dismisses her father's suggestion that she put on a coat because it's cold, but when her new fiance immediately suggests the same thing, she does.
-   In one of the _Lethal Weapon_ movies, Murtaugh's daughter comes to him and Riggs and shortly engage in a discussion about alcoholic consumption at her age. Her father says she shouldn't drink, but she brushes him off. However, when Riggs asks the same, she - having a crush on him - promises to take his advice and whole-heartedly agrees with him.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Parodied in a "Moody's Point" segment of _The Amanda Show_.
-   The variation also occurs in the _Doctor Who_ serial _Genesis of the Daleks_:

    **Time Lord**: _Daleks_.  
    **The Doctor**: Daleks. Tell me more.
    
-   The variation occurs in _Firefly_ in "Heart of Gold".
    
    **Jayne**: Don't know these folks, don't much care to.  
    **Mal**: They're whores.  
    **Jayne**: I'm in.
    
-   _My So-Called Life_: Pretty much everyone does this at least once, but Rickie and Brian are especially prone. Angela delivers an inverse version in "Life of Brian", where she calls the same sentiment "very deep" when Jordan says it and the "stupidest thing she's ever heard" when Brian says it.
-   From _Arrested Development_:
    
    **George Michael**: You know, I can see why your mom likes it. It is a really nice tree...  
    **Maeby**: We've got to get it torn down.  
    **George Michael**: ...That must die. Stupid tree.
    
-   In _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_, the second season's finale has 2 plotlines: Frank finds out that his kids aren't his, and Mac and Charlie try to become buddies with Mac's father in prison. When Frank finds out about his kids, he wants to hurt the real father. He devises a plan to follow his kids around until they come into contact with their bio dad, and then attack. Mac and Charlie say that plan is garbage. But when they talk to Mac's father in prison, he suggests _the exact same thing_, and they say it's brilliant.
-   Larry Tate from _Bewitched_ does this quite often. Darrin, or someone else will present an idea for an advert that he thinks is stupid, until the client says he likes it, to which Larry agrees.
-   In _Corner Gas_, Wanda asks Brent to babysit her son Tanner, and Brent refuses since Tanner is well-known as an Enfant Terrible who traumatizes every babysitter that's gone up against him. In a later scene, after Wanda complains that she still can't find a babysitter, Lacey mentions that she finds men who like kids attractive, and Brent immediately offers to babysit Tanner.

    New Media 

-   In an episode of _Sailor Moon Abridged_, Serena scoffs at Luna when she tells her that she can defeat the Monster of the Week by believing in herself. Then, Tuxedo Mask tells her the exact same thing and she listens to him because "he said it with a sexy voice."

    Theater 

-   _How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying_ has an instance of this; where the nephew of the president suggests an idea, which the president hates; but when the main character suggests it, the president loves it. (In fact, the only reason the main character had the idea in the first place was because the nephew told it to him after the initial failed suggestion, deliberately trying to discredit him.)
-   From _The Pirates of Penzance_:
    
    **Ruth (to Frederick):** Remember Ruth, your Ruth, who kneels before you!  
    **Pirates:** Yes, yes! Remember Ruth, who kneels before you!  
    **Frederick:** Away, you did deceive me!  
    **Pirates:** Away, you did deceive him!  
    **Ruth:** Oh, do not leave me!  
    **Pirates:** Oh, do not leave her!  
    **Frederick:** Away, you grieve me!  
    **Pirates:** Away, you grieve him!  
    **Frederick:** I wish you'd leave me!  
    **Pirates:** We wish you'd leave him!

    Webcomics 

-   Inverted in _The Order of the Stick_, where Belkar's approval of Roy's plan "fills \[him\] with shame" (doesn't stop him from carrying it out, though).
-   Paracule from _Tower of God_ is all for dropping Bam out of the Team for being basically an untouchable public enemy and only Khun agrees with him. When he notices that everybody else is against them and is leaving:
    
    "You… You Bastard! How could you betray your own friend? You're trash that can't even be recycled! You… you saw that, right, everyone? I'm also your fan, take me, too!
    

    Web Original 

-   _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_:
    
    **Penny**: It is so dumb that we've been coming here so long and never spoke.  
    **Billy**: I know. All those months of doing a stunningly boring chore...  
    **Penny**: I'm a fan of laundry.  
    **Billy**: Psych! I love it.
    
-   Played with a bit in _Red vs. Blue_, Grif saves Sarge's Life by giving him CPR when he is shot in the head. Sarge initially thanks Simmons for this, but immediately berates Grif on the foolishness of giving CPR for a head wound.

    Western Animation 

-   In the _Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog_ episode 'Birth of a Salesman,' Scratch and Grounder initially express their distaste for Wes Weasley. When Robotnik then refers to him as '\[Robotnik's\] kind of guy,' the two robots immediately backtrack and claim that they also like him.
-   The variation occurs in the _W.I.T.C.H._ episode "The Princess Revealed" between Caleb and Hay Lin:
    
    **Caleb**: It's bad enough I've got to hang a towel from my pants and ask people if they want extra apricot sauce, I'm not gonna go further demean myself by jotting down the ramblings of a love-struck girl.  
    **Hay Lin**: If you hide behind the mangrove tree and take notes, I'll do your next shift.  
    **Caleb**: Interesting...
    
-   In the _Miraculous Ladybug_ episode "Desperada", Adrien is caught in a "Groundhog Day" Loop. He's heartbroken when his crush laughs at a joke she dismissed when it was his caped alter ego telling it (in the previous loop). Although it should be noted that Chat Noir, unlike his "real identity", has a history of not taking things seriously enough, so Ladybug might well feel she _has_ to be sterner with him.
-   One episode of _Futurama_ opens with Leela inviting Bender and Fry to a poker game. Bender is reluctant, claiming he only plays with suckers. Fry then says he’ll play, to which Bender enthusiastically says he will too.

    Real Life 

-   Studies have shown that supporters of a political party are a lot more likely to support a policy if they are told that it came from their political party than if they are not told who is proposing it, or if they are told that it is being proposed by another political party (particularly one that is on the other side of the political spectrum).
-   We've all disagreed with a person just because we didn't like them.
