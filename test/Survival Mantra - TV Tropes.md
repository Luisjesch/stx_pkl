_"I think I can, I think I can, I think I can, I think I can..."_

To contrast Madness Mantra, this is a prayer, koan, or just plain reassuring phrase that gives the speaker peace or confidence, or at least forestalls a panic attack in a dangerous situation.

Be advised, reading these entries may or may not actually make you brave... but it is all pretty reassuring!

If it works at a crucial moment, it may be adopted as a Badass Creed; alternatively, characters may use an existing Badass Creed to galvanise themselves in a moment of panic.

See also Madness Mantra. Might be used in a Meditation Powerup or Bravado Song. Often an illustration of The Power of Language.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Argento Soma:_ "Maki... Maki... Maki... Maki..." A Survival Mantra that tragically, TRAGICALLY borders on Madness Mantra.
-   _Attack on Titan_'s Eren Yeager has "TATAKAE! TATAKAE! TATAKAE! TATAKAE! TATAKAE!"<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In _Azumanga Daioh_, Tomo and Osaka end up in the doldrums after summer vacation. To try and get them ready to go back to school, Chiyo starts up a chant of "Get motivated! Get motivated!" Unfortunately, keeping them motivated proves to be like spinning plates, and she quickly gets worn out.
    -   Then she tries it on someone else who is suffering from the same problem. Said someone else is _Ms. Yukari._
    -   At the beginning of each school year, Osaka tries to psyche herself up with a mantra of "Get it together! Get it together!" Unfortunately, she often focuses too hard on the mantra and forgets to listen to the teachers.
-   _Black Clover_'s Asta says "I'm not done yet" so frequently, it practically becomes this.

-   Sakura from _Cardcaptor Sakura_ has her "invincible spell": "Everything will be all right".
-   Clare of _Claymore_ has a simple _"I_ will _survive."_ and _"I will not die!_"
-   _Cross Ange_: When Ange finally gains control of Villkiss, she snaps out of her earlier Heroic BSoD as she attacks the DRAGON that killed Commander Zola earlier that episode (which was where her current BSOD intensified). As she lays the smackdown on the feral beast, Ange keeps screaming that she doesn't want to die, then finishes it off in a rage with a promise to the DRAGON that _it_ will be the one to die as she lands the final blow.
-   Azami of the _Deadman Wonderland_ series is shown to use one of these. It comes across as both a Survival Mantra and Madness Mantra: "I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. _I'M ALL RIGHT!!_" Poor thing.
-   Played with in _Durarara!!_ Shizuo Heiwajima's "Kill them all" Madness Mantra is actually this, as he's using it to channel his inner anger and _avoid_ going into Unstoppable Rages.
-   _Eureka Seven_ has "Don't beg for things, do it yourself or else you won't get anything."
-   Naoki Shinjyo does this in episode 6 of _Future GPX Cyber Formula Zero_ at the near end of the Asian race in Hong Kong:
    
    **Shinjyo**: "Run, Ex-Superion! Run...run...**RUN!** RUN! RUN! RUN! **RUN!**
    
-   In _Gantz_ Kurono Kei claims that he always wins because he always believes he will win and that others lose because they've already accepted that they might lose.
-   Possibly the most direct version is Hana Hatsuno's "(I'm) not scared!" refrain in _King of Braves GaoGaiGar_.
-   _Gundam_:
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing:_ At the end of the anime, Heero Yuy literally says "I will... I will... I WILL SURVIVE!"
    -   Jerid Messa of _Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam_ recites a more sinister one as he scrambles to board a transport out of Jaburo, competing against fellow Federation and Titans soldiers: "If you're weak, you won't survive." Justified, as those left behind were certain to perish in the trap the Titans had set for the AEUG in Jaburo.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury_: Shy, sheltered Suletta Mercury often repeats some variation of the mantra "If you run, you gain one. If you move forward, you gain two." Taught to her by her mother, Lady Prospera, it means that while there's no shame in fleeing from trouble, she'll gain more if she faces it head on. In the prequel novel, it's compared to a "spell" that helps her press forward. Episode 12, however, shows a dark side to this "magic spell", as it can justify any logic to Suletta as long as it is couched in this mantra. Prospera tells Suletta that murder is one way of "moving forward", as long as she "gains" the safety of her loved ones, and the girl immediately makes it part of her belief system without question.
-   In the _Hellsing_ OVA, a wounded Alexander Anderson starts shouting "FORWARD!" repeatedly while cutting through Alucard's ghoul army in order to get to him.
-   Kaoru from _I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying_ would say "It'll be ok." to herself to deal with her dead-end job and loneliness in the past. Not so much anymore.
-   In _Kinnikuman_ Brocken Junior is mortally wounded when attacked by three superhumans after having thrown away his own super power source, an eagle badge. Muttering 'I have failed in my duty', he slowly closes his eyes as death approaches. But then a friend throws the badge back to him. His response is to mutter 'I must do my duty...I must do my duty...I must do my duty' before screaming in the manliest possible way 'I MUST DO MY DUTY'. What follows is the first and last instance of his new finishing move which defeats his target. This moment is pretty heart breaking because all his teammates are aware he's going to die if he exerts himself and scream his name, so he gives an insanely long speech about duty before he pulls off his move. And mumbles 'I have done my duty' before dying.
-   In _Last Exile_ Mullin Shetland chants his mantra, which runs to the effect of _"Disith bullets will avoid Mullin Shetland's body"_ as he's lifted up on deck in his role as cannon fodder. It helps that the mantra contains his name.
    -   When Mullin falls in love with another grunt and rewords his mantra to protect her instead, the inevitable happens.
    -   He lives anyway, so I guess the mantra has a blanket clause.
-   _Naruto_: "I'll never go back on my word because that's my way of the ninja!" or "Give up on trying to make me give up!" (which also doubles as a Badass Boast).
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_:
    -   Shinji has: "I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away..." Not that it works very well. Sure, he doesn't run away when he starts chanting this... but it doesn't really stave off _insanity_.
    -   Asuka's is "I don't want to die!" in _End of Evangelion_. It eventually devolves into a Madness Mantra.
    -   In an early episode, Shinji continually recites the steps for loading and firing the Eva's rifle to himself during practice.
    -   Asuka also developed a self-reassurance tactic later on: if someone said something negative towards her, she started yelling **"SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!"** over and over again in rapid succession as if she was trying to lock reality out of her mind.
-   _Ojamajo Doremi:_ Majo Rika, Majo Rika, MAJO RIKA!
    -   To be specific, Hazuki (and later Momoko) whimper this when they encounter ghosts. Played to hilarious effect in one episode of _Dokkan_, where Doremi and Hana-chan turn it into an actual chant...Aiko eventually gets fed up with the scaredy cats behind her.
-   _One Piece_:

-   Brook hums the tune of "Brinks' Sake" to keep himself calm, and sings it when humming isn't enough. It's his cetacean friend Laboon's favorite song and the last song he and his first crew sang together as they all died.

-   In _Princess Principal_, Beatrice has a mechanical voice box she got thanks to being the daughter of a Mad Scientist. Having machinery surgically installed into her throat without the use of any anesthetics was traumatizing enough, but it also turned her into the subject of harsh discrimination, as she was seen as a "mechanical girl". When it breaks down during an emotionally-charged moment, she rushes away to fix it, and concentrates on saying "Hime-sama" (what she calls the Princess, the only person to reach out to her), which not only keeps a breakdown at bay, but gives feedback on the status of her voice as it's being repaired.
-   _Seraph of the End_: In the manga/anime/novel Mika thinks about how Yuu inspires him to keep going and try hard to survive in their messed up world when he sees how determined Yuu is to survive. He sustains his resolve by saying "Yuu-chan, I'll try extra hard today."
-   In _Shaman King_, Yoh has his "Everything will work out" motto.
-   Death the Kid from _Soul Eater_ manages to turn what was seemingly a Madness Mantra into one of these during his prologue chapter, right after he realizes the actual body of the pharaoh isn't as symmetrical as he thinks.
    
    **Death the Kid**: It's all in the way! In the way! In the way! In the way! In the way! In the way! In the way! _IT'S ALL IN THE WAY!_
    
-   Kirito in the first episode of the _Sword Art Online_ anime adaptation: _"I will survive in this world!"_, while later in the Fairy Dance Arc during his solo attempt at the World Tree Grand Quest he chants _"Asuna"_ in a borderline Madness Mantra way.
-   Simon in _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ ends up curled up in Lagann's cockpit mumbling "not my business" over and over after seeing Yoko and Kamina kiss.
    -   Kamina has this all over the place, with the most famous three being "Who the hell do you think I am?!", "Go beyond the impossible and kick reason to the curb!", and finally "Gattai! (Combine!)"
-   _Wolf Children_: As a child, Yuki was known for shifting in and out of her werewolf stasis, particularly when she'd get excited. When it came time for her to start school, Hana gave her a little rhyme to sing to help her remain calm and human. As a teenager Yuki began to mellow out more but in a later scene when she was being confronted by a boy in her class she nervously repeats the rhyme over and over again.
-   Another CLAMP example can be found in _xxxHOLiC_ (around vol. 4). Wherein Watanuki tries to help the far less confident sister of a set of twins by encouraging her to replace her detrimental borderline Madness Mantra with, "I won't know unless I try!" and then later, "Everything will surely go well." With a little help from Yuko, _it works_.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS_: The "three things" mantra an eight-year-old Revolver told Yusaku helped him cope during and after the Lost Incident. He keeps repeating this mantra to this very day.
-   In _Mission: Yozakura Family_, Nanao recites his own genetic code when he needs to calm down to prevent himself from grotesquely Hulking Out into his normal, three-meter tall form.
-   _Rebuild World_: Akira has "Resolve is my responsibility", to which his Virtual Sidekick Alpha responds with "Leave the rest to me!". This is basically Akira saying This Is Gonna Suck but he’ll bear it, while Alpha uses his Powered Armor like People Puppets. Akira does say it on his own in a few significant moments separated from Alpha, proving it to be this.

    Comic Books 

-   In an issue of _Deadpool_, Weasel starts chanting the Litany Against Fear when he and Al are in the Box.
-   With the heroes of _Green Lantern_, their battles often involve battles of the spirit as well as physical, so when they are hard pressed and derided as weak and worthless in that moment of pressure, a Lantern can often find strength by remembering their Badass Creed, "In Brightest Day/In Blackest Night/No evil shall escape my sight/Let those who worship evil's might/Beware my power: Green Lantern's light!"
-   _Hellblazer_ #40 had alternate reality John Constantine walking through a dark void, only to come face to face with the main version of himself:
    
    **Alternate Constantine:** Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil...  
    **Main Constantine:** ...for I am the evilest bastard in this valley.

-   _Dusk to Dawn_ Batman novels:
    -   _Batman: Melody for a Mockingbird_: Whenever Mr. Freeze starts to lose his cool, he recites the recipe for an orange and almond cake as if coaching someone on how to make it.

    -   _Batman: Grudge Match_: During the test of worthiness to retrieve the Sword of Salvation, Talia repeats, "Nyssa is dead! Nyssa is dead! Nyssa is dead! Nyssa! Is!

Repenting of his execrable actions towards both T'Pring and Christine, he meditates using the Tenets of Surak: "The words came easily. He had repeated them countless times since childhood. They were the mantra by which he meditated, the lullaby that sent him to sleep at night, the chant that awoke him in the morning. At the Academy, he had trotted miles in full gear to the rhythm of their cadence while around him other cadets were fainting from fatigue and the grueling physical training."
-   In _The Devil is in the Detail_, Dan Espinoza has the phrase, "The pudding isn't worth killing over," which allows him to break free of Loki's mind control, much to Nick Fury and Black Widow's bafflement. In context, it's because that same phrase let him break out of mind control in his series; when Dan is under the influence of an evil weapon that inflicts murderous rage, he's pointed at Lucifer. Since the only thing Lucifer directly did to Dan was steal his pudding, Dan backed down after realizing that lost pudding wasn't worth murder. On a more mundane level, after the incident, he uses the phrase to calm himself in stressful situations.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The 13th Warrior_: _"Lo, there do I see my father. Lo, there do I see my mother, and my sisters, and my brothers. Lo, there do I see the line of my people back to the beginning. Lo, they do call to me. They bid me take my place among them, in the halls of Valhalla, where the brave may live forever."_ Ironically, it is a funeral chant that was heard at the beginning of the movie. The heroes are facing down an entire army and the heroes' leader, who starts the chant, already knows he is dying from being poisoned in the last confrontation. The others join in as they don't expect to survive either and it gives them the courage needed to fight anyway.
-   _The Accountant (2016)_ recites the Solomon Grundy nursery rhyme in high-stress situations.

One demon fish to go! Can I get an Amen?").

    -   Bill uses the rhyme "He thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts!" as his anti-stuttering mantra and as his weapon against It, which is King's tribute to its use in Curt Siodmak's _Donovan's Brain_.
    -   Interestingly the mantras they use against It work _because_ they believe they work.

-   From the _MST3K_\-featured film _The Pumaman_: _"Each man is a god; each man is free."_

    -   ...another man?
-   In the 2007 film version of _I Am Legend_, Will Smith as Robert Neville likes the song "Three Little Birds" by Bob Marley, but it doesn't really become a mantra until he sings it to calm down his dying dog just before he has to strangle her to death because she was infected with the vampire zombie virus while saving his life.
-   _Zulu_: "Men of Harlech, stop your dreaming / Can't you see their spear points gleaming / See their warrior pennants streaming / To this battlefield..."
-   _The Goonies_. While running through trees in the night, Chunk plays this straight and also inverts it.

-   _Annie Hall_: Subverted, "I forgot my mantra."

    -   Later when Finn and Rey enter the Millennium Falcon...

    Don't you get too scared,
    
    Just grab your thunder-buddy,
    
    And say these magic words:
    
    _FUCK YOU THUNDER!_

-   Literally in _Reign of Fire_. The prayer we see being taught to children is actually a list of survival instructions and psychological prepping in a world where dragons have laid waste to civilization.
    
    What do we do when we wake?  
    _Keep both eyes on the sky._  
    What do we do when we sleep?  
    _Keep one eye on the sky._  
    What do we do when we see 'em?  
    _Dig hard, dig deep, run for shelter, **never look back**._
    
-   In the Bollywood movie _3 Idiots_, Rancho, one of the main characters, teaches his two roomies and best friends the phrase "Aal iz well" (mispronounciation of "All is well", which is a phrase he learned from a night guard in his hometown and he uses it to calm himself.
    
    **Rancho**: I've learned that this heart gets scared easily, so I whisper _Aal iz well_ to it whenever things are wrong.  
    **Raju**: And how does that solve the problem?  
    **Rancho**: It doesn't. But it gives me the calm I need to confront it.
    
    -   Played with when it's further explained that this was a sort of Survival Mantra for his whole town: the night guard would shout that _Aal iz well_ every night and people would sleep peacefully knowing everything was in order. Until there was a robbery and the town learned that the night guard couldn't see anything at night, he just _told_ people that everything was OK, and they believed it proving that mere words can have a big impact over one's state of mind.
-   _Bo Burnham: Inside_ features one over the end credits, the same one used by many to get through the COVID-19 Pandemic.

-   _A Song of Ice and Fire:_
    -   Arya Stark repeats the snippets of lectures from her fencing teacher: "Swift as a deer. Quiet as a shadow. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Quick as a snake. Calm as still water. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Strong as a bear" - and her "prayer" of repeating the names of everyone she's going to kill once she gets out of her hellish situation. (Did we mention she's ten years old?)

The killer, hearing her, becomes more intrigued and decides to take her alive instead of killing her immediately.

In no particular order, they are the Litanies for Pain, Relaxation, Fear (inspired by the one from _Dune_, above), Clear Thought, and Preparation. They're never actually spelled out within the narrative, and in fact weren't more than named/mentioned until the seventh book in the series, where they were included on otherwise blank pages between chapters, spaced throughout the book. On a side-note, they were actually written by members of the books' fan club.
-   _John Carter of Mars:_ "I still live!"
    -   At one point, "Remember, Ghek, you still live!"

-   In C. L. Wilson's _King of Sword and Sky_ it's a Badass Creed used as a Survival Mantra during torture: _I am the steel no enemy can shatter. I am the magic no dark power can defeat. I am the rock upon which evil breaks like waves. I am Fey, warrior of honor, champion of light._
-   In Tad Williams' _Tailchaser's Song_, the hero is taught a mantra/litany against fear to give him strength when in dire need which is also used to restore an insane companion to his true form .
-   _Nation:_ "Does not happen!"
-   _Discworld_:
    -   In _Thud!_ Sam Vimes uses the text of "Where's My Cow?" as this. It sounds really silly out of context, but it's his two year-old son's favourite nursery rhyme, and Sam reads it to him every night before bedtime.

-   In _Tales from Jabba's Palace_, Bib Fortuna spends several minutes at the end of every day reciting a mantra that soothes his nerves and focuses his objectives: "Of the day's annoyances, these," followed by all the inconveniences of the day. Over the course of the story, Bib's first entry is "That Jabba still lives," but during the epilogue, his list shortens considerably and the first entry becomes "That I had to drop the teaspoon eighteen times." This is because he has been "recruited" by the B'omarr Monks, and he is a Brain in a Jar attached to a Spider Mech, which aren't exactly the most dextrous machines on the planet.
    -   In _Imperial Commando: 501st_ we have:
        
        "_I'm not in pain. Any pain that I feel is temporary. Nothing can touch me. This is happening to someone else. I just observe it as I pass._
        
        That mantra kept Darman going when all he wanted to do was lie down and die."
        
-   _Cherub Series:_ "This is tough, but Cherubs are tougher." Used at one point to overcome conditioning by a cult...
-   In the Star Wars Expanded Universe in general, the various forms of the Jedi Code's central mantra is sometimes used this way.
    
    _There is no emotion, there is peace._  
    _There is no ignorance, there is knowledge._  
    _There is no passion, there is serenity._  
    _There is no chaos, there is harmony._  
    _There is no death, there is the Force._  
    ::Compare and contrast? The Sith Code;
    
    _Peace is a lie, there is only passion._  
    _Through passion, I gain strength._  
    _Through strength, I gain power._  
    _Through power, I gain victory._  
    _Through victory, my chains are broken._  
    _The Force shall free me._
    
-   _The Wheel of Time_: In _Lord of Chaos_, "This comes of trusting Aes Sedai. Never again; not an inch; not a hair." Arguably more of a Madness Mantra as he doesn't use it to calm himself, or mobilize hidden strengths.
-   In _A Swiftly Tilting Planet_, Patrick's Rune is used for active protection as well as a comforting prayer. Starts out stating where you are or who you're with 'in this fateful hour' ('At Tara in this fateful hour' or 'With Chuck in this fateful hour', for example) and continues:
    
    _I place all Heaven with its power,  
    And the sun with its brightness,  
    And the snow with its whiteness,  
    And the fire with all the strength it hath,  
    And the lightning with its rapid wrath,  
    And the winds with their swiftness along their path,  
    And the sea with its deepness,  
    And the rocks with their steepness,  
    And the Earth with its starkness,  
    All these I place  
    By God's Almighty help and grace  
    Between myself and the powers of darkness._
    
-   _"The Lorica of Patrick"_ is also used in Alexander Yang's _Midnight World_ series as a Vampire Hunter crew's battle prayer. They recite The Lorica in _Bullets from Beyond_ before and during the battle with four vampire mercenaries, and in _Chance with No Rules_ while Aeneas fights states-vampire Koshelev barehanded:
    
    _I arise today  
    Through a mighty strength, the invocation of the Trinity  
    Through belief in the threeness  
    Through confession of the Oneness  
    Towards the creator.  
    I arise today  
    Through the strength of heaven:  
    Light of sun  
    Brilliance of moon  
    Splendor of fire  
    Speed of lightning  
    Swiftness of wind  
    Depth of sea  
    Stability of earth  
    Firmness of rock...  
    ...and so on_
    
    -   When Aeneas encounters two vampires at once (in the same book), he recites not "The Lorica of Patrick" but Psalm 27:
    
    _The LORD is my light and my salvation —  
    whom shall I fear?  
    The LORD is the stronghold of my life —  
    of whom shall I be afraid?  
    When the wicked advance against me  
    to devour me,  
    it is my enemies and my foes  
    who will stumble and fall.  
    Though an army besiege me,  
    my heart will not fear;  
    though war break out against me,  
    even then I will be confident._
    
    -   Besides, Aeneas got his nickname because he'd chosen _The Aeneid_ as his personal Survival Mantra.
        -   And it was not the old chap Vergilius' masterpiece, but a Ukrainian burlesque poem by Ivan Kotlyarevsky.
-   Not quite a mantra, but there's also Sam's song from _The Return of the King_. (Also a Dark Reprise of an earlier song.)
    
    _Though here at journey's end I lie  
    In darkness buried deep,  
    Beyond all towers strong and high,  
    Beyond all mountains steep,  
    Above all shadows rides the Sun  
    And Stars for ever dwell:  
    I will not say the Day is done,  
    Nor bid the Stars farewell._
    
-   _Timequake:_ "You were sick, but now you are well, and there's work to do."
-   _The Dresden Files:_
    -   "POLKA WILL NEVER DIE!" seems to skirt the boundary of survival mantra and madness mantra for Butters when he gets dragged into serious action away from the safety of his lab. What really seals this as a survival mantra is that Harry later uses it to pull Butters out of a panic.
    -   Murphy in _Aftermath_ and _Ghost Story_ tells herself, "They Never Found the Body" of Harry Dresden. It seems to be the only thing keeping her going sometimes.

-   _Hourglass Door_ has "feel the fear till the count of ten, then count once more to feel brave again." Also, random quotes from the Inferno section of _The Divine Comedy_ (used by, guess who? Dante!).
-   _American Gods:_ "It's easy, there's a trick to it, you do it or you die."
-   In _Mockingjay_, Katniss uses one of these to remind herself of what she knows. _My name is Katniss Everdeen. I am seventeen years old. I was in the hunger games..._

-   In _Of Mice and Men_, it's hinted that the story George tells Lennie about the little farm they'll get when they have money has become the survival mantra for both men. George has told it so many times, in nearly the same words, that Lennie has it memorized and can finish his sentences for him.
-   Ravi from the _Bloody Jack_ series repeats "Happy puppy, happy puppy, happy puppy" to himself whenever he's afraid for his life. (He believes if he dies at that moment, he'll be reincarnated as a happy puppy.)
-   A young Vlad Dracula escapes life as a Janissary in _Count and Countess_ and chants, "I am a lion of God," to help himself make the 200+ mile walk home on his own.
-   Parodied in "Nefarious Times We Live In", a short story by Woody Allen. When the protagonist is beaten and starved by the men of an insane cult leader, he claims that "the only thing kept me from going insane was the constant repeating of my private mantra, which was "Yoicks."
-   In John Bellairs' _The Curse of the Blue Figurine_, Professor Childermass is climbing a mountain on a stormy night, searching for Johnny Dixon, who has been abducted by a ghost.

-   In _The Hearts We Sold_, James uses "I chose this" to get him through the rougher parts of working for the Daemon. Later, Dee adopts it.
-   In _The Unexplored Summon://Blood-Sign_, adherents of the White Queen have a particular prayer which is often used as this trope. Because the Queen is unworthy of their faith, she never comes...but more than once, her lover has. (Olivia, for her part, sees no difference between the two.)
    
    "Oh, White Queen who guides us to victory in extraordinary battles, please reach out to this fragile human soul..."
    
    -   The Colorless Little Girl often repeats or prefixes her other dialogue with "Nii-sama", seemingly as a way to remind herself of her original identity as a human and her reasons for changing into a Material- to protect him.
-   In _The Witchlands_, Iseult has "Stasis. Stasis in your fingers and your toes." as her mantra. She repeats it whenever she needs to center herself; _keeping to it_, however, is another matter entirely.
-   Scarlett O'Hara of _Gone with the Wind_ tells herself, "I'll think of it tomorrow" or a variation thereof. At the beginning, she uses the phrase to soothe her conscience about doing unsavory acts; later, she tells herself that when her fears of losing her home, starving to death, and such get too hard to bear. She tells herself so in the very last lines of the book, after Melanie dies and Rhett leaves her. _Tomorrow Is Another Day_ even was one of the proposed titles of the book. She also recites the mantra "As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again!"

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Imperium, especially the Imperial Guard, of _Warhammer 40,000_ has far too many of these to count. They need them.
    -   Most Notably "THE EMPEROR PROTECTS!". Poor, poor Imperial Guard.
        -   "I am a man, prone to weakness, but I am a guardsman, where weakness is death, I will crush my weakness with the weight of my pride."
        -   Too bad they're not Adepta Sororitas (them the Emperor really _does_ protect). Speaking of whom, there's also the inquisitorial battlecry/creed/mission statement, "BURN THE HERETIC! KILL THE MUTANT! PURGE THE UNCLEAN!"
    -   "They have their foul gods on their side! But we have the TANKS on OURS!"
    -   "All the Emperor asks of you is that you HATE!"

    "I will vanish into the night; change my body to wood or stone; sink into the earth and walk through walls and locked doors. I will be killed many times, yet will not die; change my face and become invisible, able to walk among men without being seen."
    

    Theatre 

-   The final scene of _Allegro_: "One foot, other foot, one foot, other foot..."

-   "Stroke by Stroke" from _Jasper in Deadland_.
-   "I Whistle A Happy Tune" from _The King and I_.

-   Lampshaded in _Alter Echo_ by Stome when he reveals his mantra.
-   Volgin from _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_ was severely afraid of thunder. Many gamers have fond memories of his "Kuwabara, kuwabara" chant.
    -   Ironically when he neglects his Survival Mantra at the end of the game, he _is_ actually struck by lightning (though it's implied that it was summoned by the Sorrow). It may have helped that he actually taunted the rain...
-   _Half-Life 2_: "Although they call me crazy, I care not, for thou art my helper, my strength, and my saviour. I have been laid down in a pit of darknesses and the shadow of death. And thy anger has pressed down upon me; and all thy cares have come down upon me. And from this bed I cry out for the kindling of thy Light! For the days of my life have vanished like smoke, and my bones are parched like ash, and let all my impurities be as... fuel for that fire! Until nothing remains, but the Light alone." Of course, this being Father Grigori, the line between Survival and Madness Mantra may be a bit blurred...
-   _Tomb Raider (2013)_: Lara Croft frequently says "I can do this. I can do this." throughout the game.
    -   Also "keep moving", the game is actually designed so that during action scenes you get punished if you stay static.

-   In _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_, at least three of the main characters have Survival Mantras playing in their heads, discovered when Kreia teaches you how to read minds. These three are arguably the most traumatised out of all the team members (An eyeless Dark Jedi, a Sith torturer-turned-smuggler, and a reformed war criminal), and have some pretty interesting mantras.
    
    **Visas Marr**: As my feet walk the ashes of Katarr, I shall not fear, for in fear lies death...
    
    **Bao-Dur**: Your command echoes still, General. And I obey, as I did at Malachor...

-   _Halo_: As revealed in the novel _Halo: The Flood_, Captain Jacob Keyes recites his name, rank, and service number constantly to resist Mind Rape by the Flood, which is stripping away his memories systematically. It works for a while, but eventually he is forced to forget his own name. The scene was adapted to animation for _Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary_, to many tears.
-   _Tales of the Abyss:_ "It's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault!" Sorry, Luke. It totally is your fault. Cue total party abandonment and Heroic BSoD.
    -   Later, he adopts a more conventional I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Surprisingly, this one actually works.
-   _Wolfenstein: The New Order_: "Count to four, inhale. Count to four, exhale."
-   Apollo Justice, _Ace Attorney_ uses the phrase, "I'm fine!" or "You'll be fine!" for encouragement, often shouted at the top of his lungs.
-   _Slay the Princess:_ While facing the Nightmare, your body begins to shut down due to her supernaturally terrifying nature. To counter this, the Voice of the Paranoid (one of the possible voices in your head) constantly chants "Heart. Lungs. Liver. Nerves.", forcing your organs to keep working through sheer obsession.
-   In _Code:Realize_, on the rare occasion that Van Helsing is pressed hard enough in battle where he believes his survival is in doubt, he starts repeating "I can't die yet" to himself.

-   In _Charby the Vampirate_, Mannick chants Happy thoughts happy thoughts happy thoughts when he gets upset enough for it to affect his portal.
-   In _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_, Abel starts mentally reciting the Bene Gesserit Litany Against Fear, when Merlitz's (who he's disguised as) old adventuring group stops by, on the look out for Cubi (which Abel is).
-   In _The Order of the Stick_ the use of the 23rd Psalm is parodied here.
-   The Walkyverse probably has quite a few, but of note is this one from _It's Walky!_: _We are beautiful._

    Western Animation 

-   _Adventure Time_: In the episode "Simon and Marcy", in a flashback to an earlier time when remnants of the world before the Great Mushroom War were more prevalent, and Simon/Ice King's Sanity Slippage was not yet complete, he actually uses the theme song from _Cheers_ as this to try to stay sane and in control while using his magic crown to defend himself and Marceline from a pack of green, oozing zombie/ghoul things.
-   _Animaniacs_: "A clown is not a hairy spider. A clown will not bite me and throw me in the basement." Admittedly, it doesn't work very well...
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: In one childhood flashback, Zuko tries to console himself with _"Azula always lies, Azula always lies..."_ after Azula informs him that their father is going to kill him. Of course, she was actually telling the truth that one time.
-   In _Drawn Together_, we have "Strong, Xander... Strong, Xander..."
-   Peter Puppy in _Earthworm Jim_ uses the first three lines of the Bene Gesserit Litany almost Once an Episode. It never works, and is almost always a sign Peter is about to transform. Wonderfully lampshaded in one episode by Jim:
    
    **Puice Dynamo:** What's that muttering about?  
    **Jim:** Oh, he's just gonna turn into a monster and maul us.
    
-   _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_: Mr. Herriman is dreadfully afraid that there is a dog in the house, so Frankie tells him to do what she did when she thought that there were monsters under her bed and say, _"There are no such things as dogs."_ Realizing this is not true, she changes it to _"A dog cannot get into the house."_ Realizing that was not appropiate either, she settles for _"A dog is not in the house presently."_

Big open spaces." When the subway breaks down, the doctor freaks out too and yells at her that the mantra is a crock.
-   Not exactly the same, but the _Justice League_ episode "Only a Dream" has Batman looping Frere Jaques in his head to stop Dr. Destiny from messing with his mind. This is when Dr. Destiny has previously incapacitated the rest of the League, is at his most powerful, and is dangerously close to Batman.
-   _The Legend of Korra_: During the finale of the second season, Tenzin, Kya and Bumi are searching for Jinora in the Spirit world and end up in the Fog of Lost Souls, which imprisons victims in their darkest memories. Tenzin tries to stay focused by reminding himself he is the son of Avatar Aang and the hope of future generations of airbenders. But the moment he almost lost his mind, a vision of Aang appeared, teaching him he should be his own person, instead of merely following in Aang's footsteps. Then he repeats to himself that he is Tenzin, freeing himself from the pressure he was about to succumb to and causing the Fog to dissipate.
-   Similar to the _Wizard of Oz_ subversion above, in _The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh_ episode "A Knight to Remember", Piglet made his way through a dragon's cave chanting "I am _not_ brave, I am _not_ brave..."
-   In _Peter Rabbit_, when Benjamin gets scared of something, he likes to remind himself that "Rabbits are brave, rabbits are brave, rabbits are brave..."
-   In the earlier seasons, _Rugrats_ occasionally has Chuckie break out in: _"I'm a big brave dog, I'm a big brave dog, I'm a big brave dog..."_ Referenced again in an episode of _All Grown Up!_

-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: In "Tea at the Treedome", SpongeBob referring to water, "I don't need it! I don't need it! I _definitely_ don't need it." It becomes a Madness Mantra when he sees a vase of it in front of him before finally howling "_**I NEED IT!**_".
-   How does _Transformers: Animated_ Prowl do it? He says it himself in one episode: "Stillness... then _strike_!"

    Real Life 

-   During the Second Battle of Fallujah, Staff Sergeant David Bellavia of the US Army's 2nd Infantry Regiment decided to _single-handedly_ assault a house where a half-dozen entrenched insurgents had earlier fended off his entire squad. Right before moving into a room which had held a cunningly-constructed barricade and machinegun emplacement, Bellavia overcame his own fear by trying to find a Survival Mantra in his mind, and remembered watching _The Exorcist_ just before the battle. Thus, he charged into close combat with a half-dozen insurgents while screaming _"The power of Christ compels you!"_ over and over again. He lived, and killed all but one insurgent in the building, including one with his pocketknife. The last, left alone because he was too exhausted to even check if they were there, was shotgunned by his squadmates later.
-   The poem "Invictus" by William Ernest Henley is a popular choice for many people facing difficult situations.
    -   A well-known example is Nelson Mandela, who recited the poem to his fellow inmates in Robben Island prison.
-   For Catholics, the St. Michael prayer could qualify for this trope, as many have been known to repeat it in times of trouble.
    
    -   Or anything involving St. Jude (the patron saint of impossible situations).
    -   23d Psalm, particularly the first four verses:
    
    1 The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
    
    2 He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.
    
    3 He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness For His name's sake.
    
    4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.
    
    5 You set a table before me in the sight of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
    
    6 Surely goodness and justice shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the House of the Lord for years to come.
    
-   The Lord's Prayer, any part:
    
    Our Father, who art in Heaven,
    
    Hallowed be Thy name,
    
    Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done,
    
    On earth as it is in Heaven;
    
    Give us this day our daily bread,
    
    Forgive us our trespasses
    
    As we forgive those who trespass against us
    
    And lead us not into temptation,
    
    But deliver us from evil
    
    For Thine is the power, the Kingdom, and the glory
    
    Forever and ever,
    
    Amen.
    
    -   And the Divine Mercy Prayer: Jesu Ufam Tobie (Jesus I trust in you).
    -   O Mary conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee.
    -   The oldest prayer to Mary, from (at least) the third century AD: "Beneath thy protection we seek refuge, Mother of God, hear my prayer. Forget us not in our time of need, but deliver us from danger; only pure, only blessed one."
    -   The 91st Psalm: _I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress..._
-   Speaking of religion, Muslims have _Allahu Akbar_, meaning "God is the Greatest." Despite the popular misconception, it can actually be used as a mantra for anything in a Muslim's life, such as giving thanks, resisting a crisis of faith, or a general expression of determination and self-assurance despite life's hardships.
-   Jews have _Sh'ma Yisroel — Adonai elohenu, Adonai ech'od_, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One", which serves the same purpose.
-   One for a program on an attempt to run back to back marathons in Death Valley. The support team noticed the runner had created his own mantra.
    
    _Pain is a sensation._  
    _Sensations are to be enjoyed._  
    _I am in ecstasy._
    
-   A common one for soldiers (and sailors), playing on black humour: "For what we are about to receive..." This is reflected in a large number of fictional works depicting combat.
-   "The Mary Ellen Carter" by Stan Rogers (rest in peace) became this in addition to being Awesome Music after the February 12, 1983 sinking of the _Marine Electric_ off the coast of Virginia in a bad storm. The ship's Chief Mate, Bob Cusick, clung to a damaged lifeboat for three hours in hypothermia-inducing temperatures, screaming part of the chorus in between waves to keep himself from letting go and drowning. Here's the man himself telling the story (plus a performance of the song) from the documentary _One Warm Line_.
-   Italian writer Giovannino Guareschi during his time in a German POW camp: "I won't die even if they kill me." It worked.
-   After Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophia were fatally shot in Sarajevo, Franz begged Sophie to live on for their kids (she didn't make it, though), and then repeated "It's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing..." all over. He didn't make it, either.
-   Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs use the Serenity Prayer as a survival mantra.
-   The Desiderata was created to be one of these.
-   While man-hauling a sledge on Scott's ill-fated Terra Nova expedtion, Apsley Cherry-Garrard repeated the mantra "You're got it in the neck - stick it - stick it - you've got it in the neck" as a distraction.
-   Steven Spielberg declared that during the Troubled Production of _Jaws_, a Drunken Song from a certain scene, "Show Me the Way to Go Home" ("I'm tired and I want to go to bed.") became one of those to the crew (who even cried as Shaw, Scheider and Dreyfuss sung it!).
-   "Self-talking" does actually do good. When one is in a stressful situation, saying "it's going to be okay" or some variation to oneself is exceedingly helpful in calming one down.
    -   And if that doesn't work out, then swearing a lot has been known to increase one's pain tolerance.
        -   But only if said person isn't already a Sir Swears-a-Lot. Precision F-Strike works better than Cluster F-Bomb.
-   If countless spy and war movies are to be believed, the whole "Name, Rank, Serial Number" routine becomes one for a prisoner being interrogated. It's the only thing they are required to reveal, and as torture or interrogation becomes more intense, it becomes the one thing they can let themselves say, over and over, to keep themselves from letting any other information slip.
    -   Truth in Television: many British army personnel, most notably RAF pilots and the SAS, are put through a severe mock interrogation lasting up to 72 hours. If they reveal anything other than name, rank and serial number they are failed. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's mantra under KGB torture was ''Intense pain is never prolonged. Prolonged pain is never intense."
