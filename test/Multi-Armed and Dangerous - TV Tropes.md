So, you've got a character that you want to show is really dangerous. You could give them the normal two arms or legs, but that's just not enough. Maybe you could replace one of those arms with a really big gun, or a sword, or have it transform into something else.

If that doesn't work, you can always give a character extra arms... because two arms good, four arms better, right?

For obvious reasons, normal humans don't get this treatment, because it would look pretty awkward having to do bodily cleaning... and having four arms to go around would be a tailor's nightmare. If you're a mutant or an evil genius, you don't have to worry about this, because Freaky Is Cool.

Multi-Armed and Dangerous characters come in two flavors:

1.  The extra arms are a regular part of the body.
2.  They're made from prosthetics/synthetic materials that are usually attached to the person.

They often have Super-Strength. Their ability to fight with extra arms is a fantastic form of Heroic Ambidexterity. Combat Tentacles are a subtrope. Occasionally you'll see such characters fighting with a weapon for each of their hands. Can sometimes be used as Spider Limbs.

This isn't what they mean, by the way, on the news when they say "The local bank was robbed by four armed men", but "To be forewarned is to have four arms."

As of the 21st century, there is (very expensive) technology that allows a person to control an artificial limb with the same mental process as an organic limb and can be used to control extraneous limbs with only a minimal period of adjustment. Truth in Television is only a matter of time...

Sister Trope to Multiarmed Multitasking, and they're the children of Vertebrate with Extra Limbs.

For other extra body parts, see Extra Digits, Extra Eyes, Multiboobage, Triple Nipple, and Multiple Head Case.

## Examples:

-   Video Games

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Lang Bao Bao from _3×3 Eyes_, in her monster form grows two extra arms. Later, one of the Nine-Headed Dragon Generals named Agassi sports six feminine arms on a muscular male body.
-   Justice from _Afro Samurai_ has three arms, one of which is kept hidden.
-   Maya from _Animal X_ turns out to have this, though it's a case of Cursed with Awesome as while the extra limbs are a boon in combat, they're caused by mutation and a sign of infertility (it's also implied that she's slowly dying due to birth defects).
-   The main villain of _Bizenghast_, Lady Hetka, has several arms where her _legs_ should be.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   Nnoitra Gilga, whose released form allows him multiple arms, as well as regeneration powers. Initially he has four arms, and four scythes to go with them. When one of his arms is promptly sliced off by his opponent, the regeneration kicks in and he also ups the arm count to _six_.
    -   Wonderweiss's release form also lets him grow a bunch of extra arms coming from his shoulders.
    -   When Renji learns the true name of his Bankai, one of the powers he gains is the ability to summon a third arm that moves along with his left arm and is strong enough to crush giant stone slabs.
    -   Senjumaru has six golden arms in addition to her regular two. She's very dexterous with them, allowing her to do things like re-tailor someone's outfit while they're distracted or weave an Attack Reflector umbrella in the heat of battle.
-   The battle-suit (mini-mecha) Double Edge from the anime _Blue Gender_ has a pair of gigantic blades on its shoulder that not only allow it to slice and dice but also double as grappling claws.
-   Umidori Kuroyoru from _A Certain Magical Index_ has the esper ability "Bomber Lance", which lets her fire lances of compressed nitrogen from the palms of her hands. Deciding she wanted the ability to fire more than two at a time, she underwent some good old-fashioned augmentations so she could attach multiple robot arms to her body to fire multiple lances. Individually those lances are smaller since the cybernetic palms are usually smaller than her own, but by combining them together she can make some _massive_ lances.
-   In the anime _Claymore_ you can see a male Awakened Being, who has six arms.
-   A fair few Digimon have more than one pair of arms:
    -   Kimeramon of _Digimon Adventure 02_ is a mashup of several heroic Digimon with Devimon (yes, that Devimon) and a Kuwagamon. It has both of Devimon's arms and one each from Kuwagamon and SkullGreymon.
    -   Asuramon is a humanoid with three heads and four arms that acts as a Villain of the Week in _Digimon Frontier_ and an Elite Mook in _Digimon Fusion_. He can shoot fire out of each of his four hands for some mean fireball and Elemental Punch attacks.
    -   GrandGeneramon of _Digimon Fusion_ has four arms, each made from one of the Seven Death Generals. The ares are those of NeoMyotismon, Gravimon, Olegmon, and Apollomon, though it soon loses the latter two thanks to their "hosts" no longer being a part of it.
    -   Oujamon of _Digimon Universe: App Monsters_ is Dokamon's Ultimate-grade form and is a blue, four-armed lion that fights like a wrestler and wears armored gauntles on all four of its hands.
    -   Recurring antagonist Millenniumon has six arms, four inherited from Kimeramon and two more on its Machinedramon Battle Aura.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Tenshinhan used a technique that had him grow two additional arms to fight Goku in the original series. Goku countered by moving his arms so fast it at least _looked_ like he had six.
    -   Inverted in _Dragon Ball Z_ with Caterpy, a giant Caterpillar warrior that "fights" Goku in Otherworld. He lives up to his Multi-Armed status with 10 arms to use for combat. His "Dangerous" side... Not so much.
-   The diclonius in _Elfen Lied_, who have multiple arms in the form of telekinetic vectors. And boy, _are_ they dangerous!
-   _Fairy Tail_: The Etherious demon Ezel of Tartaros has four arms and a bunch of tentacles in place of legs. Each of these allow him to use his Curse to unleash incredibly powerful cutting attacks with a swing of his limbs. When he goes One-Winged Angel, his arms turn into actual swords.
-   Mamoru Nagano is probably the king of this trope, because if he designs mecha the chances are that they _will_ be multiarmed. In his own series, _The Five Star Stories_, the biggest, nastiest and most heavily armed mecha of all times, the _Jagd Mirage_, had not just two like _The O_, but four deployable sub-arms, which, together with its two additional sub-legs, drove the limb count to _ten_. These sub-arms could be used to wield swords of guns, but generally were used to manipulate shields (called _veils_ there) to cover the mecha and brace it against the immense recoil of the two truly titanical cannons it carried as its main armament.
-   In _Franken Fran_, Fran occasionally affixes as many as four extra arms to her body for particularly delicate procedures; Apparently, turning a mutilated human into a giant caterpillar with a human head is fussy work.
-   Devil Getter in Getter Robo VS Devil Man has four arms<small>◊</small> each one with the power from, the other forms from getter robot.<small>◊</small>
-   The armed suits seen in _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ feature two sets of arms; a large pair scaled to the mecha used to operate weapons and manipulate large/heavy objects, and the pilot's own smaller arms to allow him to perform tasks the larger arms would be unsuited for.
-   _Gundam_ has fun with this trope in several series.
    -   Asura Gundam from _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_ is an intentional Hindu reference.
    -   The O, personal mobile suit to Big Bad Paptimus Scirocco of _Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam_ has a pair of beam saber wielding sub arms in its skirt armor, thus turning the massive Mighty Glacier looking machine into a Lightning Bruiser melee combat monster as it can wield four beam sabers at once with perfect control thanks to its mentally controlled biocomputer. That's because The O was designed by none other than Mamoru Nagano, who is a great fan of this trope.
    -   The Gaplant TR-5 from _Advance of Zeta_ also has skirt-armor subarms, while Gundam Hazel can be equipped with, in addition to the aforementioned skirt-armor subarms, two giant wire-guided rocket arms developed from the Psyco Gundam on its shoulder and wire-guided arm-shield on its forearm.
    -   The Xeku Zwei from _Gundam Sentinel_ has two more sub arms for melee and shooting a giant beam bazooka.
    -   The Neue Ziel from _Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory_ has six arms, each capable of generating gigantic beam sabers. UC, usually considered the most "realistic" of the various _Gundam_ Alternate Continuities by its devotees, ironically is even more guilty of overdoing with arms than even _Gundam 00_.
    -   Seravee Gundam from _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_ has four BFGs, two on its shoulders and two in its knees. These all are capable of sprouting hands equipped with beam sabers in addition to the Seravee's normal pair, allowing Seravee to simultaneously fight with _six beam sabers at one time_. One can see that they really went out of their way to keep Seravee from suffering from its predecessor Gundam Virtue's weakness in close-range combat. That's right: Seravee is a BFG-toting long-range artillery mobile suit with multiple arms wielding multiple beam sabers as _back-up weaponry_.
    -   The Seravee's side story variation, Seravee Gundam GNHW/3G, shows that you can never have too much of a good thing. Holy shit.<small>◊</small>
    -   _Gundam Build Fighters_ and _Gundam Build Fighters Try_ don't have too many stock suits with extra arms... but the individually-sold weapons packs do, allowing you to create, for example, a Crossbone Gundam with manipulators armed with a pistol, a knife, a guan dao and a hook. One suit with extra arms from _Try_ is the GM Powered Cardigan, which has guns and shields mounted on extending arms.
    -   Ashuramaru of _SD Gundam Force_, a living Shout-Out to the Asura Gundam mentioned above. Notably, he has two normal arms, while the other four are attached to his Shoulders of Doom. It's implied that he received them when he joined Kibaomaru, and by extension, the Dark Axis.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans_ has Gundam Gusion Rebake and its Fullcity variant, with 2 sub arms that have ordinary manipulator hands and are controlled by Brain/Computer Interface.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt_: A major part of the series's design aesthetics are the "sub-arms" which are crane like additions to the Mobile Suit back-pack. Their use show the major differences in design choices between the Federation and Zeon: Federation suits use their sub-arms for defense (having them hold the shields while the MS's main arms use the weapons) while the Zeon suits use them for offense (often the sub-arms weild guns or are used for quick reloads or weapon switching).
-   _High School D×D_: When Siegfried activates his Sacred Gear, he grows a third arm from his back, allowing him to wield three swords. When he activates Balance Breaker, he grows three more arms to wield six swords at once.
-   Some Chimera Ants in _Hunter × Hunter_ have multiple arms, and they're all far stronger than normal humans.
    -   Isaac Netero's Nen ability, the "100 Type Guanyin Bodhisattva", is a giant golden manifestation of a buddhist goddess with many, many arms. It's one of the most powerful Nen abilities in the series.
-   One of the teams in _The Law of Ueki_, which has a military theme, has a guy whose special ability is growing extra arms. To carry more guns. The upgraded form of this ability is even more arms. To shoot even more guns.
-   In the _Manga William Shakespeare_ version of _Macbeth_, Macduff appears to sport two extra cybernetic arms under his normal ones, allowing him to use four katanas at once.
-   In _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha The Movie First_, the Giant Mook from the original series that Nanoha and Fate worked together to take down was replaced with a six-armed Humongous Mecha. Unsurprisingly, it was a lot harder to take down than the original two-armed Giant Mook.
-   _Musuko ga Kawaikute Shikataganai Mazoku no Hahaoya_: Veronica is a demon with four arms, which she mainly uses for Mundane Utility, such as playing two-player games by herself or brushing her teeth while washing her body in the shower. Though since she sometimes mixes up which arms are doing what, one time brushing her teeth with shampoo, she decided that two hands are enough for some things.
-   _My Hero Academia_:
    -   Mezo Shoji, AKA "Tentacole'', has multiple arms as part of his Quirk, which can also be used to replicate other parts of his body like eyes and ears.

-   The Orphan in the sixth episode of _My-HiME_ has, surprise surprise, six arms.
-   Masashi Kishimoto likes to use this trope in _Naruto_:
    -   Kidoumaru, one of the Sound Four ninjas has six arms.
    -   Sasori has the Third Kazekage's puppet form equipped with this, ironically being one of the few examples in the series to be caused by a jutsu.
    -   One of Pain's multiple bodies, the Asura Path, has six arms, and on top of that, THREE FACES. Like all the other Paths of Pain, this is actually a reference to Buddhism; the asuras are a type of diety which also have those features.
    -   Hosts of a tailed beast are capable of making limbs out of chakra sprout from their body. Killer Bee makes Combat Tentacles while Naruto eventually learns to make them into many extra limbs that can each make their own Rasengan. This even includes making a pair of tiny hands coming from his finger that form their own tiny Rasenshuriken.
    -   By far and away the most dangerous example of this trope is Madara Uchiha's Susanoo, especially its perfect form. Four arms, two strange blades, and capable of contributing to his techniques through also using hand signs. He cuts a mountain in half with it just to show off!
    -   The above example is topped by, fittingly enough, his archenemy Hashirama Senju. To fight a Nine-Tails sheathed in the above-mentioned Perfect Susanoo, he creates a giant moving Kannon statue, complete with _one thousand arms_.
    -   Asura sports a 6-armed, 3-headed variant of Kurama's chakra form. Naruto jerry-rigs a similar aura by fusing three Kurama clones together while in Six Paths Sage Mode, and he uses the additional appendages to form a normal/Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken combo, powerful enough to engulf _an entire country_.

    -   A multi-armed demon is part of the Canis Niger group of bounty hunters.

    -   And Dynamis' One-Winged Angel form can grow (and shoot) hands at will.

    -   Nico Robin, whose Devil Fruit ability allows her to grow vast numbers of replicas of any of her body parts (she almost always uses it to make more arms). She can grow them from any place. _Any_. Place.
    -   Hatchan, an octopus fishman, has six arms, which he uses to wield six swords at once. However, this doesn't help his subpar swordsmanship.
    -   Roronoa Zoro has also developed a technique that, via the physical manifestation of his dark feelings, grants him three heads and six arms, for a total of nine swords (one in each hand, and one in each mouth).
    -   Vice Admiral Onigumo has a Spider Devil's Fruit, whose mastery of it allows use to manifest the extra arms he'd normally get in his hybrid form via his hair, allowing him to use eight swords at once.
    -   During the Thriller Bark story arc, we get a brief glimpse at a zombie general who has four arms, each holding a pistol. Given the nature of the island's zombies, we can presume that these were grafted on by Dr. Hogback. Unfortunately, we never see this zombie again, and can only imagine the badassery that he could have dealt out.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ takes this trope to its logical extreme with Patricia: A Witch that's literally _just a bundle of 6 arms in a sailor fuku_, that forms something like a rudimentary "spider". Look!<small>◊</small>
-   One of the one-off characters in _Ranma ½_, Rouge, fell into "The Spring of Drowned Asura". Asura is a Hindu god (or demon) with three faces and six arms. Rouge and Pantyhose Taro manage to destroy the Tendō home in a fight over therapeutic magnets.
-   _Rebuild of Evangelion 2.0_
    -   The Ninth Angel Bardiel, in control of Eva Unit 03, reveals a second pair of arms when its first pair are already occupied.

    -   When Akira is getting one of his arms replaced in the hospital, during their tests of the culture-grown arm that's meant to be grafted onto him, while it's supposed to be synched to his remaining arm, he moves it and his own arm differently. This impresses the doctor and prompts a discussion with his Virtual Sidekick about getting cyborg arms, and the doctor pesters Akira to buy Powered Armor with extra arms they're selling. Akira's ease in handling such is tied to him being an old world connector, but he thinks it'd be too weird .
    -   The Super-Soldier Haruka uses a Precursors technology based set of Powered Armor with extra arms fitting her Animal Motif of spiders, and she also splits her body into multiple spider-drone like monsters.
-   Played with in _Ronin Warriors_: one of the Dark Warlord Sekhmet's special attacks involves growing four extra arms, each with its own sword. The first time he does this, his opponent Ryo has _no_ idea how to counter it. Fortunately, Tagalong Kid Yuli snaps a picture of Sekhmet with his pocket camera, and it shows that the six arms are a trick: Sekhmet really has only two arms, he just gives the illusion of six by moving his arms at super-speed.
-   In _Sengoku Youko_, Senya develops a 1000-armed Super Mode based on their image of Senju Kannon after realising that his gradual Metamorphosis into "The 1000-Demon Devil" can be steered in a positive direction. The perfected version of this form has arms of Pure Energy and resembles an asura.

-   Dyna the Steampunk Fem Bot in _Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse_ has two primary arms that are purely built for combat — an Arm Cannon on her left, and a piston-powered rending claw with mounted chainsaw on the right, as well as six small spidery arms that are only used to carry out whatever acts of manual manipulation that a giant piston-powered set of battle scissors could not. Which is most of them.
-   In the _Weird Sisters_ series, this happens to Helga, Rhonda, Phoebe and Lila (among other changes) when they are exposed to a strange geode.
-   _Zim the Warlord: Irken Reversion_: As part of his Reversion, Zim grows a secondary set of arms.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Lilo & Stitch_: Stitch has four arms, but keeps the lower pair retracted when not in use. Many of his "cousins" have extra arms as well. In fact, this is so common among Jumba's experiments that, as revealed in the _Lilo & Stitch: The Series_ episode "Kixx", there is apparently a training manual on how to _fight_ against four-armed monsters.
-   _Ne Zha_: In their initial battle, after Taiyi Zhenren freezes their hands together, the Chaos Pearl overwhelms him by growing four more arms and beating the tar out of him with only one pair.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   One of the assassins in _Æon Flux_ (based on the animated show as well) has hands instead of feet.
-   In the original _Clash of the Titans_, the Kraken has four arms and the goddess Thetis says that it's capable of destroying the entire city of Joppa and all of its inhabitants. In the 2010 version it has two arms and two tentacles.
-   Numerous _Godzilla_ monsters sport multiple arms, most frequently the Big Creepy-Crawlies.
    -   _Godzilla (2014)_: Both MUTOs possess eight limbs total: the female has four forelegs, two hind legs, and a set of smaller arms, while the male MUTO has two forelegs, two hind legs, a pair of enormous wings, and a set of smaller arms. The Teaser Trailer Monster has several arms with hooked claws.
-   _The Golden Voyage of Sinbad_. A statue of the Hindu goddess Kali is animated, "grows" a sword out of each palm of her six hands and fights Sinbad and his crew.
-   Maybe not as dangerous, but used as a surprise: Zaphod tags Arthur with a surprise lower left (or is it centre?) in _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005)_. According to the novel, Zaphod had the extra arm fitted to improve his ski-boxing.
-   _Men in Black 3_ features a four-armed alien thug at a bowling alley who pulls four guns on Agent K. Subverted because K makes short work of him anyway.
-   Several Kaiju (Trespasser, Scunner, Knifehead) in _Pacific Rim_ have four arms. The Chinese Jaeger Crimson Typhoon has three arms (one large right arm and two small left arms).
-   Six-Shooter in the _Puppet Master_ movies is a cowboy puppet with six arms and as many little revolvers.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   General Grievous has arms that can both split in two. He's a cyborg, so it kind of makes sense. In _Star Wars: Clone Wars_ he could hold lightsabers with his feet, too. So theoretically he could use five lightsabers at once (one foot would still be needed to stand on). In _Legends_, Grievous had repulsorlift installed in his feet so that he could float and use his feet as hands, thus allowing him to Sextuple wield Lightsabers.
    -   Obi-Wan's contact Dex had four arms, but this may just avert this trope as he didn't play any part in the main series other than an information source. _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ (not the same as the previously mentioned _Clone Wars_) introduces another member of the species, Jedi Master Pong Krell, who "merely" dual-wielded double-sided lightsabers, but _did_ do a four-way Force shove.
    -   The Expanded Universe has more than one multi-armed alien race; the Codru-Ji, for one. Gasgano (a Xexto) appeared in _The Phantom Menace_ as one of the podracer pilots.
    -   The Thisspiasians, who have four arms and no legs (they slither along on the ground instead). They, however, prefer to keep their two lower arms hidden in public.
-   _Tales of Halloween_: In "Ding Dong", Bobbie sprouts several extra arms in her Wicked Witch persona and uses them to attack Jack.
-   During the final chase sequence in _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_, the T-1000 can briefly be seen operating the helicopter's controls with two arms while reloading and firing his submachinegun with another two.

    Gamebooks 

-   _Space Assassin_ has the deity, a six-armed Frankensteinian monster wielding six weapons simultaneously, serving as a boss battle.

    Literature 

-   Ubu Roy in Walter Jon Williams's _Angel Station_ has four muscular arms by virtue of having been genetically engineered.
-   Visser Three from _Animorphs_ morphs into a vaguely-described creature like this in _The Threat_. All that's really known about it is that it is "dark and large and has more arms than it should".
-   The Wreed from _Calculating God_ have arms in front and back as well as two on either side. They escape the "two eyes" problem by having a single optical strip that runs around their entire "head". They suffer from multiple cognitive deficits as a (dubious) result, though.
-   _The Chronicles of Narnia: The Last Battle_ shows that the Calormene patron deity Tash has four taloned arms.
-   _Cradle Series_: Sacred artists on the Path of the Endless Sword (such as Yerin) gain a silver sword-arm sprouting from their back when they first reach Gold. As they continue to advance, they gain more, until they eventually have six sword-arms and can hide them at will. Since the Path relies entirely on having a sword at the ready, the sword-arm means that they will never be disarmed.
-   The title character of Mikhail Akhmanov's _Dick Simon_ novels was born in a human town on planet Tayahat whose gravity is 1.5 Earth norm. The planet is populated by a tribal race of four-armed humanoids. Their males live for combat, and boys are trained from young age to kill (as well as honor). Dick is brought to them as a boy by his father and is raised as one of them, before leaving to join the Academy, where he receives more modern training as an operative by a red-headed Texan.
-   Tang San's Eight Spider Lances from the Light Novel and animated Donghua adaption _Douluo Dalu_ are an external Spirit Bone, and the first Spirit Bone Tang San received after the absorption of the Spirit Ring of the Man Faced Demon Spider. There are 8 spider-like legs that are fused with the vertebra of Tang San's body. Tang San can manipulate them at will and recall them into the body, storing them as energy near some of his ribs. The Eight Spider Lances contains the extremely potent poison of the Man Faced Demon Spider within the vertebra where the bone attaches to Tang San's spine, and these lances can be used to inject poison into another. Anyone who is even so much as scratched by or comes into contact with a lance without spirit power defense will immediately be poisoned and will shortly die unless Tang San removes the poison. The lances can also drain the life energy out of any living being and temporarily use it as its own.
-   Quadrus "Quad" Dominus from _Duumvirate_ starts carrying a gun for each of his four hands after a brush with death. He's six at the time.
-   In _Fengshen Yanyi_, some taoist immortals have mastered the power to obtain a monstrous battle form with three faces and six arms, which they often use to wield multiple Fabao/Paopei (the magic taoist instruments) at once, such as Lu Yue, Yin Jiao and Luo Shuan. The iconic Prince Nezha goes one step further and can sprout eight arms (two for his lance, two for the Yin-Yang Swords and one each for the bracelet, damask, fire trap and golden tile), though since his swords aren't well known he's usually depicted with six arms. Minor antagonist Ma Yuan has a magic ability which allows him to sprout a third, extensible arm from his back, which he uses to manhandle his opponents and rip their hearts out of their chests.
-   In _The Girl from the Well_, one of the ghosts Tark fights in _The Suffering_ is a _hoso-de_, a spirit which has seven arms.
-   Glerk of _The Girl Who Drank the Moon_ is a swamp monster with six limbs and a prehensile tail. His combat strategy is to stand on his hind legs and wave five swords to frighten off enemies.
-   In a bizarrely non-fantastic example, Flint Murtaugh from Robert R. McCammon's _Gone South_ is a bounty hunter with three arms: his own, and the single undersized limb of his parasitic twin, Clint. Clint is near-mindless, blind, and embedded in Flint's torso, yet has been trained by his brother to point a small pistol as a hold-out surprise. Subverted in that Clint can't aim or fire it properly, but Flint's quarry seldom realizes this.
-   One of the later Land of Oz books, _Handy Mandy in Oz_, features the adventures of a seven-armed goat herder who finds herself whisked away to Oz via an underground geyser. At several points she does indeed wield a weapon in each hand to go against her enemies, being quite adept at using her extra limbs.
-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Trilogy_: Zaphod Beeblebrox has three arms. He wasn't born that way; he got the third one added on to help with his "ski-boxing". And according to _And Another Thing..._, this may actually be so he has one hand for each of Eccentrica Gallumbits' breasts. Though it's not clear entirely.
-   The Shrike from _Hyperion_ is a 3-meter tall, 4-armed, time-manipulating killing machine (literally) covered in spikes. Granted, having 4 arms instead of 2 doesn't make it much more dangerous than it would already be, as it can stop time and wipe out entire armies.
-   Craynarbians from the _Jackelian Series_ are an offshoot Human Subspecies with natural plates of crab-like armor and two extra arms: one ending in a serrated blade, the other in a heavy club. Some steammen are equipped with three or more arms.
-   _John Carter of Mars_:
    -   The green Barsoomians are four-armed killing machines _fourteen feet tall_. They love to quadruple-wield BFSes as well.
    -   The White Apes of those stories also had four arms. Technically speaking, both species have two arms, two legs, and two "intermediate limbs" that can be used as both.
    -   A lot of the other animals on Mars had more than four limbs as well, such as the eight-legged thoats and the ten-legged banths, but these are usually legs, rather than arms. Worth mentioning, though, purely to establish that on Mars, four limbs is not the norm for vertebrates, the way it is on Earth.
-   _Journey to Chaos_: Giji Mesh has four arms and is a squad captain in the Dragon's Lair Mercenary company. She uses them to juggle swords.
-   _Majipoor Series_: Skandar are towering humanoids with four arms. They often use multiple weapons at a time when fighting and are pretty excellent jugglers as well.
-   The "Moties" from Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's _The Mote in God's Eye_ have asymmetric limbs — two small arms on the right, and one massive arm (the "gripping hand") on the left. Humans talk about how this arrangement gives Moties the ability to use fine dexterity as well as raw strength.
-   Isaac Asimov and Janet Asimov's _The Norby Chronicles_: The Others, Neglectful Precursors of the galaxy, have a head with three eyes, four arms, and two legs. The Mentor robots they left on Jamyn are built in imitation of them, much like humans tend to envision robots built in their own form.
-   The indigenous aliens of Marduk, in David Weber's _Prince Roger_ series, had four arms, which along with being huge, allowed them to carry BFGs that the humans had used on their now-defunct power armor.
    -   It was also useful with more primitive weapons since they could use their lower arms to hold up a shield while wielding a pike with their upper limbs. Similarly when equipped with simple breech-loading rifles they were able to reload with two arms while holding the rifle in the others.
-   Pritha Prithvi from _The Red and the Rest_ is a human centaur: up until her shoulders she has the body of a human, then another torso again. Besides making her very tall, this gives her four arms, much like classical centaurs have four legs and two arms.
-   The warrior drone cho-ja in Janny Wurt's _Empire_ trilogy. Their multiple arms also end in blades.
-   Marco from _Strata_ has four arms, and is an _extremely_ dangerous fighter. An invoked example, as his species (kung) normally have two arms, but those slated to be warrior-caste are operated upon before birth to cause them to grow extra limbs.
-   This is one of the key plot points in the _Tipping Point_ Trilogy, by Alan Dean Foster. Bodily manipulation is as easy as getting new custom-fitted clothing and is often used to add extra limbs. Note that these are not necessarily weapons, or designed explicitly to carry weapons; for instance, a waiter may get an extra set of arms to improve carrying capacity.
-   In the _Vorkosigan Saga_, the Quaddies are so named because they have four arms and no legs (they are genetically designed freefall dwellers.) In _Diplomatic Immunity_, Miles notes how unfair it is that their troops can literally shoot and reload at the same time.
-   The Drummer from _Wild Cards_. His multiple arms aren't exactly combat-specific, but he can use them that way quite effectively.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_ novels:
    -   The Chaos creature Skarhaddoth from _Hammer of Daemons_ has four arms. In his first appearance he wields two meat cleavers along with two shields, and in his second he uses four scimitars. There are other multi-armed Chaos beasties stalking Draakasi. _Dark Adeptus_ has various Techpriests with mechadendrites running around.
    -   In _Ciaphas Cain: For the Emperor_, there is a plot point related to this trope. A tau ambassador is assassinated in the middle of a party and no-one can see who the shooter was, especially when everyone draws weapons in the ensuing confusion. It turns out to be the person who seemed one of the least likely, Governor Grice, because he's secretly a tyranid mutant and his shapeless clothes hide not a flabby body but an extra arm easily capable of coming out to fire a gun and withdrawing back, leaving his other two hands innocently empty.
    -   Techno-magos Darioq, from the _Word Bearers_ novel _Dark Apostle_, has four heavy weapons (two heavy bolters and 2 plasma cannons), multiple heavy melee weapons, and around 10 mechadendrites. Over the course of the novel, he rips off a Chaos Terminator's arms and cuts him in half. After being bathed in flames for several seconds.
    -   Sulphus, the Techmarine from the _Deathwatch_ novel _Warrior Coven_, has three mechanical arms and one organic one. These arms allow him to fly a speeder and use the turret at the same time as well as firing his bolter, something that would normally require three people. At one point, he uses two of his arms to hold on to a spinning Talos and the other two to rip an armour plate off. He then jumps inside, blows it up and does a walking out through the flames sequence like in the first Terminator.

-   In the fourth season episode "The Way" of _Xena: Warrior Princess_, Xena and Gabrielle are confronted by a demonic sorcerer named Indrajit while in India. After Xena slices off one of Indrajit's arms, it grows back and is soon joined by four more. Now a six-armed warrior, Indrajit proceeds to prove his badassery by slicing both of Xena's arms off. But wait, there's more! Xena, literally disarmed at this point, calls upon the Hindu god Krishna to help her. He transforms her into an avatar of Kali Freaky Is Cool. Needless to say, if you thought Xena was wicked before, think about how dangerous she is once she becomes a four-armed goddess of death. Indrajit, surprise surprise, is no longer with us. When the battle is over, she is restored to normal.
-   Neil of _The Young Ones_ was temporarily granted six pairs of hands by an unseen genie, but the genie was killed and the extra arms vanished before he could use his new appendages, or even show them to his housemates.

-   The three Hekatonkheir brothers in Hesiod's _Theogony_ were massive giants (or perhaps deities) who embodied natural disasters, born with a hundred arms and fifty heads each.

    -   There is also the Gegenees who fight Hercules and the argonauts, they have six arms. And some despictions of Geryon give him multiple arms alongside multiple torsos and heads.

    -   _The Hero System Bestiary_ had the Giant Squid (10 tentacles) and Giant Octopi (8 arms), both of which were quite dangerous to humans.
    -   The raw Extra Limbs power is, incidentally, one of the cheaper ones in the game — 5 character points buy any number of extras, from a useful tail over an extra set of arms or two to a cloud of tentacles. This is because the power in and of itself is mainly cosmetic and doesn't include any "free" combat bonuses or extra actions per turn; _those_ still have to be bought and paid for normally if the character is supposed to have them.

-   Games Workshop games:
    -   The Chaos Gods from _Warhammer_, _Warhammer: Age of Sigmar_, _Warhammer 40,000_ and their spinoffs often gift their Daemonic and moral followers with extra limbs, that often end with powerful claws, slithering tentacles or some other form of combat orientated mutation.

The model for the Tech-Priest Dominus, a Tech-Priest granted command of the military forces of the Mechanicus, has four arms that allow him to carry a pistol, a larger arcane ranged weapon and the traditional two-handed axe that is the symbol of his faith.
        -   The Ruststalker Princeps who lead the elite assassination squads of the Adeptus Mechanicus often have their combat abilities augmented with the addition of a third bionic arm so that they can wield a deadly chordclaw alongside a pair of transonic blades.
        -   The multi-limbed Badasses are Techmarines and higher Tyranid organisms. Also, to some extent, Warp Spider Exarchs with their armour-mounted, independently fired weapons.
        -   Greater Daemons of Slaanesh (Keepers of Secrets, as they're known) have two regular arms (and often carry large swords or whips) and two arms with huge pincers. The Masque of Slaanesh is a Daemonette special character with three arms (one normal, one small pincer arm and one large pincer arm). Some of the parts in the current Chaos Spawn kit have things like arms splitting into several limbs or big spiky tentacles coming off the back. But then, this is Chaos, of course there is.
        -   Every Tyranid has six limbs. Some have two pairs of legs, some have six limbs that aren't much use for more than moving. The rest have two (or six) pairs of arms. And both pairs are either blades designed to rip you apart or holding guns made to shoot small organisms at you (which proceed to rip you apart).
        -   The ultimate enforcer of this trope is the Swarmlord, the top tier tyranid, with four arms each equipped with an utterly lethal bonesaber, capable of delivering a devastating curb-stomp to almost anyone in the galaxy.
        -   Dark Eldar Wracks and Grotesques (hideous Frankstenian monsters, except they're made when the various parts are _still alive and conscious_) tend to have any number of limbs, some with incorporated weapons. Their creators, the Haemonculi, like to do this to themselves too. To a lesser extent, Dark Eldar Scourges are particularly brave/stupid individuals who have paid a Haemonculus to make them capable of flight via surgical modifications to hollow wings and add wings and flight muscles.
    -   _Necromunda_:
        -   In the 1st and 2nd Edition of the game, Mutants in a Scavvy gangs could purchase extra arms that allowed them to wield more weapons during combat.
        -   The 1st and 2nd Edition rules for Pit Slave gangs gave their leaders, Pit Slave Chiefs, the option to take a number of extra bionic arms that allowed them to use multiple weapons during combat.
        -   Spyre Patriarchs, from the 2nd Edition of the game, were equipped with four cybernetically controlled combat arms. Two of these arms were sported high powered lasers similar to those fitted to the Yeld suit, while the remaining two were equipped with a pair of crushing power claws.
        -   Genestealer Hybrids typically have between two and four arms. The 3rd Edition rules for Genestealer Cult Gangs allow a player to purchase an extra arm for their fighters as an item of wargear, allowing them to easily handle an unwieldy weapon or to gain extra attacks in combat.
-   _Gamma World_:
    -   Orlens are humanoids with four arms. They all have the telepathy and telekinesis mutations, and some of them have additional mutations such as poison claws and devolution.
    -   Any mutant can have the Additional Body Parts mutation, which can be 1-10 additional arms. One example is the menarl, a giant water snake with 1-10 arms and tremendous strength.
-   _Godforsaken_: Esecran are multilimbed monstrosities that can attack every foe in close range with a different limb.
-   _Heart Of The Sunken Lands_:
    -   Gorbles and Goroulyas are four-armed monsters.
    -   Purples are large four armed creatures that can maul foes with their claws. If their opponents are at a distance they can throw boulders instead.
-   _Judges Guild_:
    -   _The Thieves of Fortress Badabaskor_. The would-be deity Angall of the Perpetual Void had four arms. He normally fought with two +1 swords in his right hands and two +1 maces in his left hands.
    -   _The Treasure Vaults of Lindoran_. In one room the PCs can fight a four-armed bear that's as strong as a giant.
    -   _Dark Tower_. The Lesser Sons of Set and Chosen Sons of Set can have multiple arms. Manahath the Chosen, a Chosen Son of Set the PCs will encounter at the end of the module, has two pairs of arms.
    -   _The Dungeoneer_ magazine #10, article "Monster Matrix". The Reflector Beast has four arms and can attack its enemies with a long, thin dagger in each hand, and it can split its attacks among up to four opponents at a time. It can also throw up to eight daggers per combat round at anyone who tries to be clever and stay outside of its melee range.
-   _Old World of Darkness_/_Chronicles of Darkness_:
    -   The game _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_ has the Ananasi werespiders, whose hybrid form has either six arms, six legs, or four of each (the player picks one at character creation). However, it takes a fairly high-level spell to be proficient at multitasking. It's also worth noting that the Bagheera wereleopards/panthers' most powerful spell is the _Juddho_ form: a 12-foot, six-armed monstrosity in a state of frenzy for the spell's duration and wielding a flaming sword in each hand. Um yeah, one of multiple reasons why Vampires were never strong in India.
    -   In the _Promethean: The Created_ setting, Pandoran transmutations are capable of granting extra limbs. There is also a Sourcebook which provides a multi-armed fighting style. The title of the Prometheans who work to cause decay, the Centimani, means "Hundred-Handed". Most Centimani are usually content with a few extra pairs of limbs, tentacles and maybe some redundant organs, but there isn't much that stops a truly ancient, powerful and horrific Centimanus from adopting a hundred arms and fifty heads like Hecatonchires, their namesake monster.
    -   Two examples from _Vampire: The Masquerade_. First and foremost are the Tzimisce, whose clan specialty, Vicissitude, allows them to mold living beings — higher levels and sufficient skill could allow them to grant extra limbs to whatever they desire. And their clan-exclusive Path of Enlightenment encourages experimentation. One such experiment was the bloodline called the Blood Brothers, who were created in packs and had an ability that, at higher levels, could allow them to "borrow" body parts (frequently limbs for attacking) from others in their pack.
    -   Demons from _Demon: The Descent_ can buy several sets of extra limbs for their demon form at character creation, with the option to buy even more as they increase in power, although "limbs" in this case is a bit of a stretch as they includes things like lengths of chain with butchers hooks on the end, industrial vices that orbit the demons body and crab pincers attached to its back by lengths of plasma. Bonus points for being able to manifest these in human form with only a slight amount of effort.
-   _Pathfinder_ introduced the kasatha (mask-wearing tribesfolk), the shobhad (effectively Green Martians), and the witchwyrd (enigmatic arcane nomads), all of which have four arms. _Starfinder_ made kasatha a core race, re-introduced the other two as playable options, and added the skittermanders (adorable, cooperative downplayed Heavyworlders with _six_ arms).
-   _Rifts_ (and also _Palladium Fantasy_) has Rahu-Men, four-armed giants who can wield giant-sized weapons in each hand.
-   _RuneQuest_:
    -   In the default world of Glorantha, the giant Grotarons (a.k.a. Trimanes and Maidstone Archers) have a third arm where their head would be (and eyes on the backs of their hands and a mouth in their solar plexus...) They use massive bows, held in their left and right arms and drawn with their top arms.
    -   Supplement _Dorastor: Land of Doom_. The Chaos creature Yeachi has four arms. It uses them to fire arrows from two bows at once in ranged combat or hit opponents with the bows (attacking with them as if they were staffs) in melee combat.
-   Old-school _Talislanta_ has the Ahazu, a four-armed jungle-dwelling Berserker Proud Warrior Race.
-   _Varanae_:
    -   Green Giants have four arms.
    -   Nara-Simha are humanoids with the heads of lions and six long arms that end in powerful claws.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_:
    -   Nocturn, with two arms for holding swords, one for holding his Squid Launcher, and one that's just his tentacle. He used to have two tentacled arms, but one was cut off by Pridak, which regenerated without the tentacle.
    -   Gorast, thanks to shapeshifting herself into an insectoid form.
    -   The Frostelus species in its entirety.
    -   And in the 2015 reboot, Skull Slicer.
-   _Hero Factory_: XT4 and Speeda Demon.
-   _LEGO Space Police_: Frenzy is the Trope Namer, being described in a log video as "multi-armed and dangerous".
-   _The Transformers_ has had a few figures with extra arms over the years, either deliberately or as a result of fans being able to tweak the transformation. For example, the G1 Autobot Repugnus could have his mantis-like monster arms unfolded and deployed when he was in robot mode while Insecticon Kickback had four arms normally. In the "War For Cybertron: Siege" subline, Shockwave came with extra bits that let him add a second pair of arms that each ended with an Arm Cannon instead of a hand, while the Brunt could form an extra set of arms with large claws that attached to another character.

    Visual Novels 

-   One of the Bloodmetry scenes in _Spirit Hunter: NG_ reveals that Kakuya has two extra arms stored in her traditional garb, larger and more bloody than the delicate ones she usually has on display. At the end of the game, when she's trapped Akira and plans to have 'grown-up' fun with him, she transforms into a Humanoid Abomination that has three claw-tipped arms.
-   In _We Know the Devil_, Jupiter gains these when possessed by the devil, and in the True Ending.

    Web Animation 

-   The Boss Battle of _Banana-nana-Ninja!_: Feast Master involves a four-armed Humongous Mecha wielding giant kitchen utensils.
-   _Gaming All-Stars_: Goro and Kintaro in _The Ultimate Crossover_ and _Remastered_, along with Tikimon in _2_, all of them having four arms and being rather menacing threats to match.
-   The Nemesis in _gen:LOCK_ has four arms and uses them to great effect when fighting the heroes' Holons. In the season 1 finale, it's been upgraded and has more legs, as well as Combat Tentacles.
-   Angel Dust in _Hazbin Hotel_ is a mobster-turned spider demon known to wield multiple Tommy guns in Pentagram City turf wars.
-   _Meta Runner_ features Marco, the boss of an underground gaming arena who utilizes two robotic arms as his player 2 in co-op games.
-   Deegan in _Recess Reindeer_ has four arms.

    Web Comics 

-   The main characters in the furry webcomic _At Arm's Length_ come from a race of magical beings that naturally is four-armed. The ladies kick monster behind to protect mortals while keeping their magical origins secret from society at large.
-   In _Champions of Far'aus_, Digressa, one of Sarengal’s Zealots, has two arms hanging off of her back that become functional after she dies and becomes undead, giving her a total of four swords to fight with at once. Daryl realizes he can’t get close enough to land a hit during their fight as the extra limbs allow her to both defend and attack at the same time. Rom’s Imagine Spot implies this is the case for Sarengal’s other zealots as well.
-   In _Coga Nito_, Niko gains an additional pair of arms as Smooth Criminal when combining with two robots at once.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, the spider-like Aberration has 3 pairs of arms which he uses to wield 6 knives.
-   In _Fite!_, Lucco grows _six_ extra arms when in "God of Boxing" mode.
-   _Girl Genius_:
    -   Baron Wulfenbach's secretary Boris wields four swords to great effect against the Hive Engine bugs.
    -   Similarly, the four-armed English noblewoman Ariadne Steelgarter is able to wield a combination of bladed weapons and guns; whether there is any connection between her and Boris remains unknown. She is also able to stab two soldiers when she changes her mind about surrendering, because they forgot they had to hold _all_ her arms.
-   The Nemesites in _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!,_ being insectoids, naturally have four arms.
-   Nikitaks, from the _Inhuman_ universe, have 4 arms, all of which can also be used as legs. And razor-sharp claws on every arm.
-   An unusual example in _I Was Kidnapped by Lesbian Pirates from Outer Space!!!_ in that Jane is a four-armed alien who fights with a single pistol. Though her extra arms do come in handy in other dangerous situations.
-   Jagganoth's Yenenman Mantle form in _Kill Six Billion Demons_ has a seemingly near-infinite number of arms, each one wielding a weapon (mostly swords) and extending behind their body akin to that of the Thousand-Hands Bodhisattva. The true number is unknown, but according to the (somewhat contradictory) lore the number could be 500, 1000, or 80,000.
-   _Leaving the Cradle_ has a whole species of multi-armed aliens. Of whom, Nea Khtara certainly qualifies as a badass, being able to swing humans around like ragdolls and bending a steel pipe with one hand.
-   _Metompsychosis Union_: Mag has four arms, which he uses to quite effectivley disarm and beat up guards while escaping the docks.
-   In _The Order of the Stick_, this is one of Durkon's (as well as all the other dwarves thus far appearing in the strip) fears concerning trees: they have so many "arms" that they'd be able to attack you dozens of times per turn. That trees don't actually move doesn't dissuade his fears. They're just waiting for the right moment to overthrow us all.
-   Several cosmic entities in _Problem Sleuth_ have multiple arms, most definitely inspired by Hinduism. Most notable are Godhead Pickle Inspector and Black Hole Mobster Kingpin, although GPI doesn't exactly fit the "dangerous" part.
-   _Ruby Quest_: Tom has an extra pair of arms. They're much smaller than his main pair and are usually concealed under his shirt, but give at least one opponent a very nasty surprise.
-   _Schlock Mercenary_
    -   Subverted when it's pointed out that a four-armed alien has the same type of eyes as a human, and as a result, even if he can handle four guns at a time, he can still only aim at one target, same as everyone else.
    -   Played straighter with the title Sergeant Schlock who can extrude additional arms as needed. We never did get to see the twin sawn-off multi-cannon and plasma gun combo in action, though.
-   _Sleepless Domain_: The monster that breaches the Inner Barrier in Chapter 8 is a massive, formless amalgamation of body parts, with any number of arms attached to its amorpheous "body" at any given time. What's more, each of these abnormally long limbs branches off into a web of numerous smaller arms, constantly shifting and reforming and extending to pull its victims in closer.
-   _Sparklecare_: Dr. Doom has 4 arms and 4 legs. Although it's kind of ambiguous how innocent he is, his limbs are definitely the creepiest parts of his design.
-   The heroine of the Krakow Studios comic _Spinnerette_ cribs another hero's origin story and gets four new arms out of the deal.
    -   Another character in another Krakow comic is a demon schoolgirl naga who also has six arms. Maybe the creator just likes ladies with extra arms?
-   During her recovery after her transformation the main character of _Surprising Octeal_ is attacked by a mad super the author affectionately dubbed "Machamp Norris".
-   _Val and Isaac_ has the four-armed mercenary Space Dread.
-   Grontar in the webcomic _Zap!!_: a huge four-armed mechanic.

    Web Original 

-   4chan gives us Ball of Arms Man, created from a _Mutants & Masterminds_ DM's complaint about a player who wanted to make a character who'd spent all his powers on Additional Limbs. He's a sentient portal to the Elemental Plane of Arms, meaning that he has pretty much an infinite supply of arms.
-   _Chuck Norris Facts_: There is no chin beneath Chuck Norris's beard; there is only another fist.
-   _SCP Foundation_:
-   _The Slender Man Mythos_: Slendy, Humanoid Abomination that he is, is often shown with lots of arms/tentacles/branches/whatever they are.
-   Jack from What Is This Black Magic You Call Science'' can have up to eight arms, each one representing one of his eight tails, since his human form is an illusion covering his true form.
-   In _Worm_, the Endbringer Tohu has four clawed arms.

    Western Animation 

-   In the _Æon Flux_ animated series, there was a very very brief shot of Trevor with a four-armed assassin. However, she was beset by bees almost immediately upon her introduction and was killed shortly (due to an allergic reaction to bee stings). Talk about one-shot.
-   In the Buttons and Mindy Superhero Episode "Super Buttons" from _Animaniacs_, Buttons battles a carnivorous spider person (the mayor's own words) atop City Hall, an anthro spider supervillainess with four arms. She puts all four hands to use operating a giant fly swatter to put Buttons out of commission.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ has a really weird "daydream" of Aang's that had Appa standing on his backmost pair of legs while the other four each had a katana. He also saw Guru Pathik with six arms.
    -   Later in the same sleep-deprived haze, Aang imagines Appa wielding a katana in_each paw_, and whirling around like a tornado to fight Samurai!Momo.
    -   Sequel Series _The Legend of Korra_ has Dark Action Girl Ming-Hua, who's missing both flesh-and-blood arms but can use waterbending to create prostheses at will. And it turns out she's _not_ limited to two at a time.
-   _Ben 10_ has a few multi-armed alien species. The ones Ben uses both have two sets of eyes to match their arms.
    -   One of Ben's most frequently used forms is Four-Arms, a hulking red brute with Super-Strength and a really deep voice.
    -   From _Ben 10: Alien Force_, Spidermonkey.
-   _The Bots Master_: The robot Ninjzz is a three-armed asymmetrical variant. He only has one right arm, which is a crossbow Arm Cannon, while he has two left arms designated for wielding his various ninja weapons.
-   In an episode of _Danny Phantom_, we are introduced to Pandora, a ghostly version of her Greek counterpart, but with an additional pair of arms.
-   In _Duck Dodgers_, Martian gophers (including Martian versions of Mac and Tosh) have six limbs. Since they're Funny Animals, this makes them multi-armed rather than hexapod.
-   In the episode "The Crawler" of the _Extreme Ghostbusters_, secretary Janine gets abducted by an insectoid king and was transformed into a moth-like creature with four arms. She later leads the king into thinking that she's truly transformed, and unleashes a ghost trap right in front of him by hiding it with her second pair of arms and wings that she acquired through said transformation. She gets better.
-   Zigzagged with Elzar, the four-armed Neptunian cooking show host in _Futurama_. It was revealed in one episode that during the 3007 economic depression, he made something called "Human Broth" to feed impoverished citizens. (It doesn't take a genius to figure out what it was made of.) Of course, whether that makes _him_ dangerous to humans _personally_ isn't known, and he _probably_ doesn't do that anymore. (Well, probably. Stranger things happen on this show.)
-   _Gadget Boy & Heather_ introduces a villainess with six arms and uses a spider theme. Unsurprisingly, she goes by the name of Spydra.
-   Another show by the same creative team of _Ben 10_ that features a multi-armed character is _Generator Rex_, where the character Breach, a psychotic-emo girl dressed in a sailor suit uniform with her hair draping over her face who underwent mutation with the activation of nanites that resided within her body, has a another set of arms protruding below her original set of arms (while the forearms of her original set has grown monstrously huge!). Strangely, she doesn't really seem to use her additional limbs all that much even while in combat. They usually just like to hang around while her upper limbs get the job done. Occasionally, she has been seen using those extra arms of hers... to only mimic and move in concert with the gestures her upper arms perform. To be fair, her overly humongous upper arms kinda blocks the use of her lower pair of arms for anything _but_ making gestures. And besides, she also has the ability to generate and create numerous portals on a whim.
-   _Jackie Chan Adventures_:
    -   In one episode Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy Hak Foo obtained the Bands of Shiva, a pair of bracelets that when worn made him grow extra arms.
    -   Also, one of Shendu's siblings, Tso Lan, has two smaller arms underneath his main arms, and he's one of the strongest enemies on the show.
-   Several characters on _Jimmy Two-Shoes_, such as Molotov's unnamed wife, the Gnomans, the Racing Fleas, and a sizable number of background characters. A few of them also have multiple legs as well.
-   In the _Megas XLR_ episode "DMV - Department of Megas Violations", Darklos the bounty hunter has an army of what seem to be humongous four-armed rhinoceri.
-   Four arms are a recurring element with _Ninjago_ villains. There's Samukai, the Skullkin general in the first season, Stone Army General Kozu in the third season, Nadakhan and the Giant Stone Warrior in the sixth season, and Mr. E in the eighth season. Long-running antagonist Lord Garmadon gains an extra set of arms for a time in the third season, and this is referenced in _The LEGO Ninjago Movie_, where these are a feature he's had since he became Lord Garmadon. This tendency is because each line the villain was featured in had a MacGuffin corresponding to each of the four main ninja, and so having a four-armed villain poses the threat of them wielding all of them at once.
    -   It became so much of a recurring element that Jay lampshades it when Mr. E uses the stolen Oni Mask of Vengeance to gain four arms.
-   _Regular Show_ features two four-armed characters, a wrestler going by the name of Four-Armageddon, and Death's Wife.
    -   Mordecai and Rigby also become merged into a two-headed, four-armed form during "Video Game Wizards."
-   In _Samurai Jack,_ Jack had to defeat all nine of the champions at the Dome of Doom to survive and free the prisoners that were forced to fight. One of the champions is named Ganeesh, a Hindu deity-like creature with stereotypical Arabian clothing and swords, who has six arms and a sword in each.
-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_:
    -   In the episode "Mewberty", Star's Bizarre Alien Biology\-induced transformation into a purple butterfly-like being gives her six arms.
    -   "Game of Flags" reveals Star's mother, Queen Moon, undergoes a similar transformation into a multi-armed humanoid butterfly when she "dips down" and taps into her full magical potential.
-   In _Steven Universe,_ having extra sets of body parts (usually arms or eyes) is a common trait of fusions. Of the Crystal Gems' fusions, five out of seven have multiple arms. Then there's Malachite, a two-Gem fusion with THREE sets of arms, two of which function as legs.
-   In _Stripperella_, a supervillainess going by the name of Pushy Galore has two (hidden) extra sets of arms due to, in her words, the fringe benefits of being a genetic physicist. After revealing her six-armed frame, she even tells Stripperella to call her Octo-Pushy. Sadly, she only gets screen time in one episode, though the slight perk is that she actually uses her six arms to do a multitude of actions that are lacking in many other animations featuring multi-armed characters (such as piloting and controlling a blimp with all six of her arms).
-   In _Sweet Sea_, Squidney can turn his tentacles into many different things, including a human hand, cages, and simply elongating them to steal things.
-   In _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)_, the turtles get attacked by an alien four-armed female assassin in the episode "Divide and Conquer." Living up to this trope's name, she quickly mops the floor with them.
    -   Fists, a Gladiator Games competitor from "The Arena" has four very muscular arms and uses them to Drop The Hammer with great force.
    -   In the 2012 turtles the mutant Spider Bytez has several spider arms on top of his head, which proves quite effective for fighting the turtles.
-   _3Below_ has Krel and Aja who have four arms each, and while nice, are not to be underestimated.
-   _Totally Spies!_ had a villain of the week who was a ringmaster that wanted to use a mirror device to mutate and deform the masses into a freakshow as revenge for being mistreated. He was a sideshow himself, known as Octo-boy because he had two extra sets of arms, a fact he reveals as he physically confronts the spies for thwarting his plans. The girls can't help but compliment his tailor for making a suit that completely hides that fact.
-   The evil Dr. Killemoff from _Toxic Crusaders_ was a four-armed pollution-breathing alien from the planet Smogula, and his two sets of arms is a trait shared by his fellow Smogulans.
-   An unused (read: toy-only) character from the _Beast Machines_ / _Transformers: Robots in Disguise_ cartoons named Bruticus (not to be confused with the G1 gestalt of the same name) could pop out a second pair of arms in robot mode. Appropriate, since his alt-mode was _Cerberus_.
-   Mecha-Shiva from _The Venture Brothers_, at least according to the eponymous characters' court testimony against The Monarch.
-   The Third Arm Sash in _Xiaolin Showdown_ acts as, well, a third arm for grabbing onto things. However, it is only used for its secondary ability to extend out to an arbitrarily long distance, so the characters can grab things out of reach. The only times it gets used in addition to both other arms is when the Monks use it to do chores.
