**Otacon:** Well, Snake, I tracked down the Patriots' Wisemen Committee, but all I found was a note.  
**Snake:** What does it say?  
**Otacon:** _"Buy the sequel! Coming soon!"_  
**Snake:** Damn you, Kojima!

A Sequel Hook is something in a work that suggests that there is a clear possibility for another story. The MacGuffins may come in threes, the Big Bad might be Not Quite Dead, or, more blatantly, as the story ends another adventure might be shown beginning.

The original work still has closure but, by leaving minor plot elements unresolved, the writer has made writing a sequel easier. If the audience demand is there, they'll be ready. In fact, this method is so common the audience will identify _any_ unresolved plot element or any ending short of Happily Ever After or "Everybody Dies" Ending as a hook. Sometimes the hook was just that, the writers are not sure which direction they would be going in the later work.

Pretty much every film based on a comic book sets itself up for a sequel, and any movie that goes out of its way to establish a very expansive universe that has room for a sequel. In the case of adaptations their source is usually a medium known for making multiple storylines and, in most cases, have a decades-long Myth Arc to mine for ideas.

If the Sequel Hook revolves about a character other than the main character, it may indicate a possibility of Changing of the Guard.

Make note that a Sequel Hook is not a combination of a Mythology Gag you noticed and wishful thinking. This is where the movie takes a brief side glance to let you know that more is coming. This is recognizable to almost anyone watching/reading, not just the fans that notice a minor gag in an adaptation.

If the story is complex enough, there can be a fine line between this and an outright Cliffhanger. And the two can overlap if the story concludes, everyone's happy and then a new problem shows up to put everyone in turmoil.

If a movie poses a Sequel Hook only for no sequel to ultimately be forthcoming, this can be the source of unintentional humour later on down the track.

Considering that most stories need a conflict because of the Rule of Drama, this trope may often result in Happy Ending Override, Status Quo Is God or All for Nothing if the sequel is made.

Compare The End... Or Is It?, Here We Go Again!, The Stinger, And the Adventure Continues, To Be Continued, Saved for the Sequel, Sequel Snark, and "Will Return" Caption. Can occur as part of Inescapable Horror. Compare and contrast Second Chapter Cliffhanger, when more than just a hook, the second installment ends with a Cliffhanger, with everything still up in the air. Obviously, **many unmarked spoilers ahead**.

-   Video Games

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   Back in 2008, the slighly random _Kamen no Maid Guy_ actually set up a serious storyline - at the very end of the series.
-   It had been made clear in _Tokyo Mew Mew_ that Ichigo and friends had been de-powered because there was no need for them to fight. Then, we see everyone back at the cafe months later and, depending which version you're following, either their marks have reappeared and they transform, or Ichigo's cat ears reappear and Berii looks in the cafe window.
-   A post-credits sequence in _Strike Witches_ features Yoshika receiving a letter from her supposedly-dead father. But seriously, who saw the first two episodes and thought he was actually dead in the first place?
-   The ending of _Petite Princess Yucie_ has all the lead girls inexplicably attend the Princess Academy once more, even though they all graduated already. Yucie also seems to be no different as a Platinum Princess. But it's especially clear that a sequel was planned when all the girls shout "see you again" in the last shot. This was in 2003 and there still is no sequel in sight.
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_: The end of the first season makes it look like everything went back to normal, only for Rika to told by Oishi of mystery happenings in her town. This shows that the "Groundhog Day" Loop is still ongoing. The second season's first episode proves this by telling what really happened after Rena held her classmates hostage.
-   Subverted in _Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture_, when Geese shows up halfway through the film to show us his RAGING STORM...and then is absent for the rest of the movie. Sequel time? Nope, they never made another.
-   _Bamboo Blade_ has Tamaki and a long-haired girl turn their heads to each other in the ending credits. Les Yay aside, this could mean that there is more in store.
-   The six years later epilogue of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's_, which has everyone talking about being reunited after a long time, the three Aces on their way to a mission, the brief introduction of Reinforce Zwei, and the scene cutting away just before said Aces reveal their new Barrier Jackets. All a hook for the _A's to StrikerS_ manga to follow-up on around half a year later.
-   _Giant Robo_ has possibly one of the most sadistic, but not because of any fault of the writers'. The final OVA episode ends with the Earth decimated but able to recover, the IPO gutted of several of its top men, and Smug Snake Koumei informing the Magnificent Ten that all is according to the plan of Lord Big Fire, with Operation BR about to begin, suggesting that Big Fire is about to launch a true operation to conquer the world after Genya's plot both crippled their major opponent and simultaneously made sure the world would survive to be ruled over, leaving it ambiguous as to whether the entire operation was masterminded by Koumei or Big Fire himself. However, the sequel was unable to be made due to funding problems, so several critical explanations and Koumei's presumed come-uppance were never actually made, much to the frustration of the OVA series' many fans.

-   _Slayers_:
    -   The last light novel ends with Lina and Gourry traveling to Lina's homeland, Zephilia. Cue loads of Will They or Won't They?. There's also the fate of Zelgadis and Amelia, considering that they were left to their own accord after the eighth novel (their replacements were Killed Off for Real in the last two novels), and Zelgadis' side story takes place after that time.
    -   The second anime season ends with Sylphiel running off with the heroes, but she's nowhere to be seen in the third (being replaced by Filia), so this is a subversion. Also, the last season has more of this than the third did, with Zelgadis riding on a boat contentedly sticking out among them.
-   Blatantly lampshaded in _Baccano!_, when the two Meta Guys Carol and Gustav argue over why some plot threads are left untied (such as a scene in the first episode that never gets referred to again. At least in the anime...). Carol's answer? Sequel Hook.
-   The second season of _Hayate the Combat Butler_ ends with a new semester beginning for the cast, as well as a _very_ brief shot of Athena during the final credits.
-   For _Heroman_, Kogorr is defeated, and everyone is happy as the episode ends, fading to black. But, then it fades back in to show a prison island, with lights blazing and alarms shrieking. The prison's guards get decimated by Veronica, who frees Those Two Guys, and breaks down the wall to a certain cell, filled to the brim with equations, formulas, and drawings. A pencil is spit to the floor as the cell's occupant turns around: Dr. Minami. Cue To Be Continued. We even see a question mark afterwards.
-   _Pokémon Adventures_ would always use this at the end of an arc. It may seem a little silly, as the release of a new _Pokémon_ generation already indicates a coming sequel, but it is often done to show either the new Arc Villain, the direction they'll be heading with the next chapters, or just a way to explain how one arc leads to the next, chronologically:
    -   _Red/Blue/Green_: The Elite Four, ominously watching the tournament match between Red and Green, and take an interest in Red.
    -   _Yellow_: It's revealed that Yellow's journey had been engineered by Green. While her reasons are not revealed, she's shown on her PokéGear calling someone, discussing that she hadn't found what she needed through Yellow's adventure. The next we see is Silver, the rival of _Pokémon Gold and Silver_, hanging up, and a shot of Johto with a group of Generation II Pokémon as the chapter ends.
    -   _Gold/Silver/Crystal_: Averted, for some reason or other there is no link to the next arc at the end of this one, everyone just gets a Happily Ever After to the point where it seems like the whole series could just end here.
    -   _Ruby and Sapphire_: After the battle, the Red Orb and Blue Orb used to maintain Groudon and Kyogre shatter into pieces. A shadowy figure shows up and picks up the pieces. Holding two red and blue shards, he says, reciting what comes across as a prophecy, "Creation of the new world order lies in thy hands." Next we see Giovanni, standing there with the shards, where his last words at the end of the chapter are "...And it has already begun." Especially shocking as this occurs after a Happily Ever After ending, where _almost_ every loose end is tied up.
    -   _FireRed and LeafGreen_: Arguably larger than _Ruby and Sapphire's_. After the Big Bad is defeated and the characters all get their just endings, Sird shows up as Mewtwo flies away, using the last amount of energy she could attain for one last attack... _Which turns the Pokédex holders to stone._ And with that, the arc ends.
    -   _Emerald_: Crystal, looking back at the photographs from the battle, recalls Archie's last words when she confronted him about the origins of his suit of armor. She asks him who gave it to him, but he can only get out the beginning of the word before dying, as his last word is: "Galac..."
    -   _Diamond and Pearl_: So Cyrus has been defeated, Dialga and Palkia are peaceful again, and Platinum has finally achieved her goal of making the Berlitz family crest. Everything should be back to normal now, right? _**WRONG.**_ She then states her intentions of rescuing her original bodyguards, then a weird scientist suddenly shows up, Byron and the researchers stop him, but they accidentally manage to open up a black hole, where a large claw swoops down and sucks in Dialga, Palkia, and Cyrus. The scientist just grins, tells Platinum his name and about the Distortion World, and escapes. Dia manages to take his notebook from him, which reveals information about the legendaries. Flash forward to Flint and Volkner having a conversation, where Flint reveals that he's in the Battle Zone. _Another_ flash forward two weeks later, where Platinum's mother is on a cruise ship, and she and her daughter have a talk about the Distortion World.
    -   _Platinum_: All is well and everyone has their Happily Ever After conclusion, but we then get a scene with the Daycare Center man begins to have a flashback to another trainer - that trainer being Gold, directly leading into the next arc.
    -   _HeartGold and SoulSilver_: A very unique case, as this arc is actually an Out of Order Interquel the _Diamond and Pearl_ arc, revealing that this arc was a Stealth Prequel to the previous two arcs.
    -   _Black and White_: Ghetsis escapes, but not before knocking Black backward into the magnetic pull that is restoring Reshiram to the Light Stone. Black says a tearful farewell to White as he is being sealed into the stone along with Reshiram, and after he is, the stone teleports away. White is left to cry and scream for Black to come back, while Ghetsis is left to begin plotting his counter-attack with his mysterious masked colleague, who is revealed to be Mad Scientist Colress. In the last scene, a group of Team Plasma grunts defect from the group and go on the road...one of them being just a child, recognizable as the female protagonist of _Black 2 and White 2_.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_ tends to have these at the end of each era:
    -   A trainer from Hoenn appears in the Silver Conference at the end of the Johto era, and this leads to the original series ending with Ash travelling to Hoenn. The last episode ends with Pikachu sick.
    -   The Hoenn era ends with Gary re-appearing with an Electivire, a Pokemon discovered in Sinnoh and Ash travelling to Sinnoh.
    -   Not much is gleaned at the end of Sinnoh for Unova, except for Giovanni's newly-introduced secretary giving Jessie, James, and Meowth a promotion for a mysterious "new project", since their role in destroying Team Galactic had renewed Giovanni's faith in them.
    -   The last arc of the Unova era sees Ash, Iris, and Cilan accompanied back to Kanto by Alexa, a reporter from Kalos, and her Helioptile, a Pokémon native to Kalos, thus causing Ash to travel to Kalos.
    -   Again, very little can be gathered from the end of the Kalos era about Alola, save for Team Rocket dropping souvenir trinkets of Solrock and Lunatone at the Lumiose City airport in the last episode.
-   _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ ends with sudden, completely nonsensical plot twists thrown out left and right just after _everything_ has been resolved. Basically, Stocking pulling a Face–Heel Turn and slices Panty into 666 pieces, and Big Bad Corset pops out of Brief's penis (It Makes Sense in Context, I swear) to tell Brief that if he wants to save Panty, he must follow the pieces to the next town and unlock the hellgate there. Your typical Gainax Ending, as it were.
    -   Also, the whole thing may actually just be a parody of this trope; the creators have been very coy about a second season, and it's quite possible they have no intention of making one and came up with a twist just to troll the fans.
        -   It's also quite likely that, knowing them, they will make a second season but completely ignore the cliffhanger.
        -   Most likely a typical Gainax troll, but who's up for Brief and Chuck with Garterbelt?
    -   Most of the show's creators left Gainax to form Studio TRIGGER, so even if they actually wanted to do a sequel series, they can't do so for legal reasons. Also, the Twitter account for the Gainax West studio (which closed down in 2017, by the way) once teased the possibility of new PS&G material...that turned out to be just a themed temporary café and exhibition.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_. Both seasons. Season one: Setsuna's line: "As long as the distortion continues to exist, I will continue to fight...Alongside my Gundam." Also, Tieria's "This is the Gundam that will change the world..." while we see a container saying "GN 00 00 GUNDAM". In season two, Tieria's "The true goal of the Aeolia Plan was to prepare Humanity for the dialogues to come." And after the Credits, we see a 15 second teaser for the movie, which ends with the text: "2314: The Childhood of Humankind Ends." If those don't practically say "There'll be another season" and "We're planning on making a movie", I don't know what does.
-   The last episode of _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_, especially The Stinger. The director has stated that he wants to do a second season\- though it's unknown whether he wants a genuine sequel or a Spin-Off.
    -   It eventually turned out to be _Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie: Rebellion_...which _also_ ended on a sequel hook. And an even bigger one at that.
-   The _Fullmetal Alchemist_ manga averts this to the point where it seems like the writer was literally trying as hard as possible to prevent any possible sequel or need for a sequel. The 2003 anime version on the other hand ends with Ed getting ready to do another transmutation to get Al back by sacrificing himself. The _Conqueror of Shamballa_ movie fittingly picks up a short time after the hook, with Ed stuck in the "real" world after his transmutation was successful.
-   The creators of _Death Note_ have themselves admitted that they are undecided whether the Death Note that Aizawa was holding at the warehouse was real, or if Light's bluff about it being fake was true. They claim that if the book was a fake, the real one is still out there somewhere, meaning "Ryuk could return somehow..."
-   In _Pretty Cure All Stars New Stage_, when Ayumi returns to normal from being Cure Echo, the uniform's bow drops off, turning into a Cure Decor, the MacGuffin for _Smile Pretty Cure!_, but it is never picked up by either Ayumi nor the Smile team. While she only makes a cameo in _New Stage 2_, she comes back for good in _New Stage 3_, wearing the Decor as a pin and being able to use it to transform.
-   In the 13 and a half episode (no, seriously) of _Tenchi Muyo!_, after Mihoshi and Washu have their talk and we see what Washu's doing to Ryoko, we're cut to a scene where D3 is talking to Tokimi and we see a mysterious figure in the shadows. That figure, Z, would show up in the third season.
    -   As well, in episode six, we're introduced to Washu, who's Ryoko's "mother" and is incredibly smart, and Tsunami, who has a major connection to Juraians and Sasami in particular. Both of those are explored more in the first two episodes of the second season.
-   _Tiger & Bunny_ had the Ouroborus symbol appearing on a Stern dollar at the epilogue of episode 25. Also, Kotetsu and Barnaby coming out of their retirement and joining the Second League Heroes.
-   In the final episode of _High School D×D_, Sirzechs and Grayfia were discussing about how the Red Dragon Emperor (Issei) is now part of the devil society. It seems they were happy about Issei crashing the wedding until Grayfia mentions that the Vanishing Dragon will make his appearance. Cue the second season of the anime.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   Double Subverted at the end of _Phantom Blood_. Dio is defeated, Jonathan and Erina are married, they're boarding a ship to America for their honeymoon, everything points in the direction that the story is now ending. Oh, some guys are carrying a treasure chest onto the ship with a still-alive Dio in it, how cute. Hang on, we're seeing what happens _right now_? Hold the phone, did Dio just _kill_ Jonathan?! Well, darn, that's a bit of a Downer Ending...wait, Erina is pregnant with Jonathan's child? The Joestar legacy lives on!
    -   At the end of _Battle Tendency_, an older Joseph can be seen at a modern airport mentioning to a Japanese tourist that he's going to Japan to see his daughter and grandson, the latter of which is the protagonist of the next part of JoJo, _Stardust Crusaders_.
-   _Space☆Dandy_'s hell of a second season finale closes out with a card reading "May be continued?"
-   _Tokyo Ghoul_ infamously concluded the original series with a sudden and shocking ending filled with these, before announcing the sequel roughly a month later. The final chapter of the original series was almost nothing _but_ this trope, setting up the sequel with hints of Kaneki becoming Amnesiac Hero Haise Sasaki, Aogiri and Dr. Kanou beginning new experiments using Yoshimura and captured Ghoul Investigators, Touka declaring her intention to wait for Kaneki to return, The Reveal of the Clown Gang, and Tsukiyama falling into an Angst Coma. The result of these hints is Tokyo Ghoul: re.
-   _Brave10_ ends with the Five Iga Ninjas defeated and the Braves at last united, but Date Masamune spends his last scene exclaiming about how any setbacks don't matter because a great war is coming, and while calmed down for now, Isanami's Superpowered Evil Side is shown wrapping its arms around her in the last panel.
-   _Love Live!_ had one where Hanayo gets a text, before announcing the spinoff series _Love Live! Sunshine!!_ two years later.
-   Unlike _Dragon Ball Z_, which had a definite (albeit open-ended) ending, _Dragon Ball Super_—in particular, the first batch of episodes—ends like this, with Goku telling Jiren that he wants to fight him again and Frieza rebuilding his empire after being brought back to life. The next part of the series begins in _Dragon Ball Super: Broly_.
-   _Space Patrol Luluco_ has the Blackholian saying he will be back for "the second and the third" (whatever that may mean) before being subdued by Nova and disappearing. Keep in mind that the whole show is basically the origin story for Studio Trigger's mascot, and that the characters can travel through space and dimensions, so it could mean that the characters will make appearances in future Trigger shows rather than a "true" sequel.
-   _Agni's Philosophy_: Still hunted by her attackers, Agni flees with the crystal astride the dragon. WITCH Episode 0 seems to be the beginnings of a follow-up.

    Asian Animation 

-   _BoBoiBoy_: The first season's finale has BoBoiBoy's friends see him off at the train station as he boards the train set for home. A Time Skip to 6 months later, his friends are back in school, and their teacher announces that they have a new student. The walking feet and the wall silhouette of a familiar figure are shown to the sound of the ending theme music triumphantly swelling in, and his overjoyed friends see BoBoiBoy at the door and exclaim his name, then cut to credits.
-   The _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_ season _Mighty Little Defenders_ is about whether or not the goats can befriend the wolves. At the very end of the final episode, one of the wolves is upset about the newly-formed friendship and wants to stop it. This suggests that the conflict between the goats and wolves isn't really over and that it's possible for more stories to be written about their conflict.

    Comic Books 

-   A comic book example is found in the six-issue Marvel Boy limited series from 2000. At the end, Marvel Boy ominously tells the government agents that in five months, the super prison he is in will become the capital of the new Kree Empire. After that, the caption advertises Marvel Boy 2:001!!!, a title that will likely not see the light of day, since Marvel Boy's next appearance was during the 2006 Summer Event Civil War.
-   P.R.O.J.E.C.T.'s "Superman 2" vault at the end of _All-Star Superman_.
-   _Ultimate Marvel_:
    -   At the end of _Spider-Men_, Peter makes it back to his own universe and starts wondering if his dimension has a Miles Morales (the new Ultimate Spidey). We don't see the results of his web search (until _Spider-Men II_, that is), but Peter is stunned.
    -   _Ultimate Wolverine_: Quicksilver, laying in a hospital bed, is recruited by someone for something. To be continued in...Ultimates: Disassembled!
    -   _Ultimate X-Men_: After everything is said and done, and the Professor is relaxing at home with Jean, he mentions that he hopes that Nightcrawler will return someday, and they can be all under the same roof with Magneto and the others. Magneto? Did he just say Magneto?? Don't fall asleep now, professor!
    -   _The Ultimates 3_ sees Magneto, after everything that happened, swear revenge on the whole world.
-   _The Black Knight_: At the end of _The Black Knight_, the nephews find Lusène's calling card in Scrooge's trophy room promising his return. At the end of _The Black Knight Glorps Again!_, Lusène is last seen observing his suit of armor traveling in orbit around the Earth through a telescope.
-   _Kid Colt (2009)_, which didn't get a sequel, is packed full of hooks:
    -   Sheriff McGreeley, who originally framed Kid Colt for murder, is still in office, hasn't directly confronted Colt at any point, and hasn't suffered any consequences other than paying out a bounty in the belief that Colt was dead.
    -   When Bounty Hunter Sherman Wilks is first introduced, crooked Sheriff McGreeley mentions that Wilks has been busy clearing land for one of the Sheriff's brothers, suggesting that the late Joshua McGreeley - who was killed by Colt - has at least two more siblings who might want revenge.
    -   The fate of Colt's younger brother Jeb is left undefined, as Colt Never Found the Body after Joshua McGreeley's men killed the rest of his family.
    -   Outlaw leader Bloodeye comments that he thinks he's destined to cross paths with Kid Colt again.
    -   Kid Colt is still looking for the surviving members of Joshua McGreeley's gang, seeking a witness who can clear his name.
-   _Shakara_: After Shakara's Heroic Sacrifice to destroy Cinnibar Breneka and the universe returning to a state of relative peace, the last pages show a new yellow-colored Shakara crash-landing on a planet in another reality.
-   _Stunt Dawgs_: Parodied. When the Stunt Scabs flee in the end of a comic book story, the last thing their leader says is "Set up a sequel!"
-   The Dreamwave _Mega Man (Classic)_ comics end on a hook for a _Mega Man X_ series, specifically X traveling back in time to 20XX to enlist Dr. Light's help for (presumably) the Maverick war. Dreamwave's financial collapse meant that no _Mega Man X_ ongoing would ever be made.
-   _Justice League/Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ ends with the Wham Shot that Brainiac has survived his apparent destruction by infecting Alpha 5.
-   The first three of the four _G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers_ crossover miniseries by Devil's Due Publishing each end with a plot thread to be resolved in a subsequent installment.
    -   _G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers_ ends with the US government planning to develop new technology from the remains of the downed Decepticons, leading to the creation of Serpent O.R. (this continuity's version of Serpentor) in _The Art of War_.
    -   _G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers II_ ends with Dr. Mindbender being busted out of prison by the inhabitants of Cobra-La, who plan to summon Unicron, a plot thread eventually given closure in the final miniseries _Black Horizon_.
    -   _The Art of War_ ends with Optimus Prime musing on how Hawk's connection to the Autobot Matrix of Leadership may ensure that one day he'll usher humanity into a new golden age, which also serves as a set-up for _Black Horizon_.
-   At the end of the first _Spook_ story line Mr. Nobody's buyers have been killed or arrested and Kurylenko has been dealt with but several of the Spook making devices are seen being loaded onto ships and sent to unknown buyers around the world.
-   The four-issue _My Little Pony/Transformers: Friendship in Disguise!_ miniseries, which crosses over _Transformers_ with _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, ends with Shockwave revealing to Megatron that he was able to record the original coordinate data from the malfunctioning space bridge that enabled the Autobots and Decepticons to enter Equestria after Optimus Prime had the space bridge on Cybertron destroyed to prevent the Decepticons from still being a threat to the ponies.
    
    **Shockwave**: So perhaps, with your permission, I may begin an effort to simply bring their magic _to us_?
    
-   _Mighty Morphin Power Rangers/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ ends with Rita Repulsa and the Shredder fleeing to Dimension X to make contact with Shredder's allies there (presumably Krang and the Rock Soldiers), heavily implying that they're not finished battling the Power Rangers and the Ninja Turtles.
-   The end of "With a Vengeance", the final arc of Jeph Loeb's _Superman/Batman_ run saw one with Darkseid talking with Mr. Mxyzptlk about a possible future event involving the two of them — which became an Aborted Arc both the real life event of Loeb leaving DC after his son's death and the in-universe ones of Darkseid's arc in both _Countdown to Final Crisis_ and _Final Crisis_ itself, as well as Mxy going into a self-imposed exile in the former until _Superman Reborn_.
-   Each of the _Batman: Earth One_ volumes ends with the introduction of a major Batman villain who has a bigger role in the next volume. The first volume ends with an appearance by The Riddler, the second volume with Catwoman, and the third volume with The Joker (as well as cameos by Robin, Batgirl, and Ragman).
-   Though _Super Crooks_ is mostly self-contained to the four issues, it does end with The Bastard taking over the Las Vegas casino by force and swearing revenge. The fact that the trade is marked as Vol. 1 does suggest that Mark Millar may continue the story should he feel the desire to.
-   _Wonder Woman: Dead Earth_: In the final issue, Diana regains her full power and finds one of her gauntlets to keep her powers under control again. However, she needs to find the other one to activate the limiter, and she also vows to find her mother and make peace with her.
-   _Planet of the Apes/Green Lantern_ ends with the revelation that General Ursus faked his killing of Gorilla Grodd as he did his ordered murder of Dr. Zaius so that he and Zaius can use Grodd's psychic powers for their own ends, in addition to Cornelius turning out to survive his Heroic Sacrifice, coming to in a universe inhabited by humans while still bearing the Universal Ring.
-   _Star Trek/Green Lantern_:
    -   The first miniseries _The Spectrum War_ ends with Sinestro, Atrocitus and Larfleeze escaping.
    -   The second miniseries _Stranger Worlds_ concludes with Sinestro getting away once more as well as the Federation choosing to help their universe's counterparts to the Guardians found an equivalent to the Green Lantern Corps.
-   _Batman: Two Faces_ has its Framing Device end with Peregrine White responding to Commissioner James Gordon that he has his own story to tell, setting up _The Superman Monster_.
-   _Justice Riders_ ends with Felix Faust rising up and walking away after the heroes seemingly shot him dead.
-   The Vertigo run of _Astro City_ concludes with someone claiming to be a former pilot of the N-Forcer armor coming forward, intended to set up the first original graphic novel.
-   _The Simpsons Futurama Crossover Crisis_:
    -   The first miniseries ends with numerous _Simpsons_ characters ending up in New New York.
    -   The second miniseries ends with Mom making a clone of Mr. Burns and having to wait a year for the clone to cool.
-   After the Bat-Family make-up and undo Derek Power's criminal enterprise in _Batman: Beyond the White Knight_, FBI Agents Diana Prince and John Stewart arrive and offers them a job preparing for an alien invasion. Their target? Superman.

-   Most of _The Ghost Map_'s final chapter is a Sequel Hook, with Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, and Inspector Lestrade fully aware now that Moriarty is out there and will be returning. But it's the final scene with Moriarty himself that really clinches it.
-   At the end of _With Strings Attached_, the four (especially Ringo) _ask_ to be given another opportunity to use their magical bodies.

-   The coda of _The Stars Will Aid Their Escape_ reveals that Nyarlathotep impregnated Fluttershy as a backup plan.
-   _Post Nuptials_, the first story of The Nuptialverse, deals with the emotional fallout of Twilight's friends not believing her in "A Canterlot Wedding", and while most of it is dealt with, Spike still feels incredibly guilty and won't speak to Twilight. Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash senses something is wrong with Scootaloo, and Pinkie is dealing with her own family issues. All of these problems are dealt with in the sequel _Families_.
    -   The side story _Metamorphosis_ ends with Chrysalis swearing revenge on Twilight, Shining Armor, and Cadance.
    -   _Families_ ends with Discord contacting Chrysalis in a dream and ordering her to meet with an "associate" of his in order to plan his release. Meanwhile, relations with the dragons are now tense due to Garble's actions, and on top of that, several canon Season 3 events are alluded to (Trixie plotting her revenge, the reemergence of the Crystal Empire).
-   At the end of _Earth and Sky_, Chrysalis is still on the loose, and has embarked on a scheme to replenish her strength by becoming a beloved foal actress.
-   _Hard Reset_ dangles one of these by way of a Cryptic Conversation.
-   In the _Total Drama_ story _Courtney and the Violin of Despair_, Courtney acquires the similarly cursed Violin of Doom at the end of the story. Subverted in that the story's closing note of uncertainty is actually a nod to the sci-fi classics of the 1950s, which tended to leave room for a sequel despite there being no plans for a sequel. So far as is known, the author has no plans to actually write a sequel (which would obviously be titled _Courtney and the Violin of Doom_); but he has stated that if he ever does, it might be something like _The Perils of Pauline_ and would probably be openly pro-Courtney as opposed to the revenge fic subversion of the original.
-   _Faith and Doubt_ ends with the words "End of Volume 1" and credits. It then cuts to the five remaining elements of harmony discussing their plans to invade Equestria and take over the bodies of the Bearers.
    -   The sequel, _The Abundance_, does it again: Everything is wrapped up and the characters get a happy ending...except Princess Celestia and Luna's adopted father, Lord Tydal, escapes from the afterlife to warn them that the precursors to the ponies are coming and will be bringing hellfire with them.
-   The _Justice League of Equestria_ series has a setup of each story having two sequel hooks — one for each individual story's potential sequel, and the other being part of the setup for the eventual main crossover between all the storylines:
    -   _Mare of Steel_: First, there's the fact that Silversmith is still free, and has samples of Supermare's DNA to experiment on. Then, the last scene shows Darkseid opening a boomtube to Equestria.
    -   _The Princess of Themyscria_: Ares, defeated by Diana and now trapped in Tartarus, meets Circe, setting up a future Villain Team-Up. And then the last scene has Athena revealing to Hippolyta that Ares opening a portal to Tartarus has created a crack in reality that Apokolips can take advantage of.
-   The _New Look Series_ has a couple of these.
    -   _Link's New Look 1_ ends with Peach calls Toad to pick up some stuff that she plans to use on Link in the near future.
    -   _Sonic's New Look 1.5_ ends with Sonic leaving with his makeover undone, but Rouge has the security footage on the day's events and has plans for them.
-   Examples from The Calvinverse:
    -   A rather blatant example: the end of the Credits Gag in _Calvin and Hobbes: The Movie_ has Calvin commanding people to read the sequel.
    -   Likewise, _Lost at Sea_ itself ends with Rupert and Earl returning.
    -   The titular creature in _Attack of the Teacher Creature_ is revealed to be a guy in a suit...but there are some things that don't match up, and Chapter 7 mentions a dark shadow near the end, hinting that the Teacher Creature was Real After All. Then there's The Stinger, where Rupert and Earl return...again.
-   _Shadows Awakening_: The epilogue involves Captain Black recruiting the J-Team to head a new subdivision within Section 13 dedicated to magical threats, Tohru becomes a full chi wizard and takes on Jade as an apprentice, and in the last scene, Daolon Wong's apprentice emerging to take control of his resources.
-   _MLP Next Generation: Know Fear!_ ends with three hooks: Starburst dedicates herself to continuing to fight the war, even as a renegade; meanwhile, unknown to her, Nox is raised as a Black Lantern; and in the final scene two more power rings — one Orange, the other Violet — arrive on Equestria.
    -   The sequel likewise ends with three hooks: first, there's a self-exiled (and still partially corrupted) Nidra joining up with Starburst, then there's Annie deciding to keep fighting to protect Equestria, and finally, two more rings — one Red, one Indigo — arrive in orbit, but pause there due to complications in finding hosts.
-   _Planet of the Cats_ ends with the possibility of exploring more of the titular world beyond where even the Catians have gone.
-   _Aftermath of the Games_ ends with Sunset and Sci-Twi now working with Princess Twilight to discover how magic works in the human world before it becomes too widespread and noticeable, Princess Twilight is now able to talk to the Human Flash Sentry more with a magic journal just like Sunset has, and and the now-unemployed Cinch is approached by Miss Chrysalis to discuss a common interest in magic.
-   _Child of the Storm_, intended as the first book in a multi-volume series, ends with a number of dangling plot threads: while HYDRA is defeated, a number of its leaders escape to rebuild, while their threat causes the governments of the world to start their own superhuman programs (including the resurgence of the Red Room). Chthon's temporary rising is causing various evils around the universe to stir. A resurrected Voldemort strikes an alliance with Selene. And all the while, as Doctor Strange foretells, Thanos is waiting in the wings.
    -   The sequel _Ghosts of the Past_ ends with several plot thread setups, mostly due to the fact that it grew so long that the author split off the back half as its own story, _The Phoenix and the Serpent_. These include Umbridge being set to Hogwarts to oversee security for the remaining parts of the Triwizard Tournament, Voldemort preparing the next stages of his plan, Strange sending Harry through a portal for the next part of his training (implied to involve time travel), Malekith being revealed to be working with Surtur, and the Shi'ar receiving a recorded message warning about Doomsday.
-   The epilogue of _Entities of Emotion_ is very much The Stinger, showing the Death Entity resurrecting King Sombra and taking him as a host, setting the stage for the Blackest Night to fall on Equestria.
-   At the end of _Extremely Naughty_, Adrien's mother returns, And she has a little girl too, signaling the start of _Extremely Nice_.
-   _Empathy_ ends with the National Super Agency deciding to recruit the Big Hero team to work under the Anti-Villain League and a mysterious villainous figure visiting Callahan in jail and forcibly recruiting his services. This leads into _Unity_.
-   _Convergence_ ends up with Talia al Ghul bringing Jason Todd Back from the Dead in order to make him escort her son Damian to Batman while she betrays her father.
-   Several of the Expanded Universe one-shots of _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_ can end this way:
    -   _Cynthia Gaiden_ ends with Cynthia looking forward to exploring an uncovered ruin in the Orange Islands after the weather at Shamouti stabilised.
    -   _Clay Interlude_ ends with Team Cipher having succeeded in saving Lovrina and being pleased with the power of the Shadow Pokemon demonstrated when Lovrina clashed with Clay and them moving forward with their plans.
    -   _Argenta Interlude_ featured the first appearance of Mitsumi, which leads directly into her role as a protagonist in _The Wild Boy from Sinnoh_.
    -   _Cipher Interlude_ ends with The Reveal that Mizutaro was turned into a Shadow Pokemon.
    -   _Astrid Gaiden_ ends with Astrid accepting Mabel's offer to train under her.
    -   _Guzma Interlude_ ends with Guzma making a phone call to Lusamine.
    -   _Sanpei Interlude_ ends with Capriccio promoted to Admin and assigned to plan and oversee a full-scale operation in Alola.
    -   _Kiawe Interlude_ ends with Capriccio and Naps preparing for the full-scale Alola operation and Capriccio planning to capture Darkrai for Team Cipher in exchange for help finding and killing all his nieces and nephews.
    -   _Blaine Interlude_ ends with Al, Ken & Harry of Team Rocket finding what they were looking for and reporting back to Giovanni.
    -   _Hala & Hau Interlude_ ends with Hala and Kukui preparing to establish Alola's Pokemon League.
    -   _Looker Interlude_ has two. The first is Blake being on Team Cipher's trail and assigned to Orre. The second is Koya having a lead on Newton's disappearance, that he was talking to a man named Kaisei.
    -   _Wicke & Nephew_ Interlude has Hala inform Frax and Velvet that the time has finally come for their Grand Trial.
    -   The G-Men Interlude leaves three: Krysta being assigned to recruit a vigilante bloodliner trio for their ranks, Lance getting a call from Clair that his father wants to see him, and Frey calling Lorelei to meet up and spend some time together.
    -   _Jane Jackrum_ Interlude ends with Professor Hastings contacting Professor Oak with an idea to bring peace to Trainer and Ranger nations.
    -   _Steven Interlude_ ends with Steven contacting Lysandre, requesting for help in searching for the Megalith shards to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.
    -   The _Melemele Grand Trial Interlude_ ends with two, ranging from the minor bit of Frax possibly about to capture a Hawlucha, to the more serious bit of Lusamine detecting Cosmog and calling for Zilant to find it for her.
-   _Queen of All Oni_ ends with several dangling plot threads meant to set up future sequels:
    -   Tohru, now a fully fledged chi wizard, takes a still-Shadowkhan (but no longer corrupted) Jade and Left/Lee with him on his journey to help her find redemption and her new place in the world.
    -   Viper, still physically a Shadowkhan, leaves in order to hunt down Blankman in the hopes that the stolen Monkey talisman can restore her humanity.
    -   Blankman, using the ten talismans he managed to steal, seizes control of the Magisters to pursue his own agenda.
    -   El Toro quits lucha libre, and is recruited by Ramirez and his associates in the Mexican magical community to fight the new evils on the horizon.
    -   Two of the Oni essences, whose Generals were killed during the Final Battle, are as a result not sealed with Tarakudo and the others, and are therefore still potentially in play if they find new hosts.
    -   The degradation of the Grand Design is implied to have started, causing ancient sealed evils to start being released, like a wolf made out of smoke that possesses a teen Uncle hired, which the story ends with Jackie chasing.
-   _Heart of Fire_, the first part of _The Heart Trilogy_, ends with Kathryn dying as she tries to use her magic to save Smaug from death and overexerts herself. However, a mysterious figure takes her body away with unknown intents as the heartbroken and dying dragon sinks in the Long Lake. However, afterwards Andraya and Freyja fish from the lake a comatose man who has the same appearance as Smaug when he has taken a human form in Kathryn's dreams.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Old West_: Though the Big Bad and his henchmen have been dealt with, Henry is still at large and hasn't yet confronted Rattlesnake Jake for killing his brother. Also, Jake's lover Grace Glossy owes Henry a favor (for telling her where the Big Bad imprisoned her son) which he promises to claim someday.
-   It's more or less heavily implied that _All This Sh\*t is Twice as Weird_ will get a sequel, since it's the first story in the _Twice Upon an Age_ series. But just to make it absolutely clear, the "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue sets it up by having the story's editor - Varric Tethras - tell the author what it's going to cover. (It Makes Sense in Context.)
-   _Young Justice: Darkness Falls_, At the very end of the fic, while their plans have been halted for now, Lex Luthor is now plotting to create Metallo to fight the League, which finally happens in _Young Justice Titans_.
-   _Hellsister Trilogy_: At the very end of the first fic, it's revealed that Darkseid was the one who kidnapped Satan Girl and Mordru's baby with the aim of raising him into his perfect and utterly loyal weapon.
-   In _Avatar: The Last Alicorn_'s last chapter, Twilight begins getting land for the future Republic City, and Tirek escapes his bonds, setting himself up as a future foe and the possible equivalent of Amon and a little bit of Vaatu for the future.
-   _Control_ ends with Yukari running off again after deciding to keep her baby. A few months later, Nyamo finds a letter inviting her to a wedding between Yukari and a guy she's never heard of (and who isn't the baby's father). This was meant to lead into a sequel but the sequel was never written.
-   The _Thomas & Friends_ fanfic _A Cracked Ruby_ ends with a stationmaster looking at a poster for the Great Railway Show and asking the Flying Scotsman if he would like to participate, leading to the author's adaptation of _Thomas & Friends: The Great Race_.
-   _There Was Once an Avenger From Krypton_:
    -   _Close Encounters of a Gem Kind_ ends with a distress call in a modern _Altean_ dialect, mentioning Etheria.
    -   _Changing of the Guard_ ends with Carol talking to Max and Rook about a coup on Akiridion-V, with the royal children fleeing to Earth. In addition, the Forever Knights are aware of Ben having the Omnitrix and the Trolls underneath Arcadia, and are definitely plotting something.
    -   _Thanatos Scowled_ ends with Nico and Ellie heading to the UK to recruit a witch for their team.
-   _Guardians, Wizards, and Kung-Fu Fighters_: The story's version of Season 1 ends with various loose threads: Captain Black beginning a secret investigation into the Dark Hand's infiltration of Section 13, the Dark Hand preparing some kind of magical WMD, Nerissa and Ludmoore both plotting the next steps in their respective plans, the Cavalcade of Horrors and their Master preparing for the culmination of their own plan, and a grieving Jade leaving Earth for Meridian.
-   _Avengers of the Multi-verse_: The first season ends with the Cabal still active, the Avengers planning to recruit allies from their respective dimensions to counter the Cabal, and the mysterious leader of G3 stating he will reveal himself in the future.
-   _All Mixed Up!_ ends with Oprah receiving an order of ten jars of jellybeans and remarking that "I hope she likes these..." While not intended to be an out-and-out sequel, the fanfic _Patterns of the Past_ follows up on it, as we get to see exactly who she ordered the jellybeans for.
-   _Castling Cozy Glow_ ends with Cozy (more or less) officially going from Villain Protagonist to Reformed, but Not Tamed and (reluctantly) agreeing to become Twilight's friendship student in hopes that she'll eventually be able to earn the power and position she wants legitimately, like Twilight herself did. While her release and reformation is officially announced to Equestria at large. And the epilogue has Twilight getting a letter from her sister-in-law, Princess Candence, asking her to take her daughter, Flurry Heart on as her student as well.

    Film — Animated 

-   _The Adventures of Tintin (2011)_ combines this with And the Adventure Continues, when Tintin shows Captain Haddock the scroll he discovered in the globe where Sir Francis kept his treasure, leading to the rest of the Unicorn's treasure.
    
    **Tintin**: How's your thirst for adventure, Captain?  
    **Haddock**: Unquenchable, Tintin!
    
-   _An American Tail_ ends with Fievel riding on the back of his pigeon friend Henri. When he looks to the west, beyond New York City, and asks if he can explore more of America, Henri replies "Someday, you will!" This scene was replayed at the beginning of the trailer for the sequel, with the voice-over declaring "That day...is now!".
-   The post-credits scene for _Batman vs. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ has Shredder escaping the ruins of Ace Chemicals Jokerized.
-   _BIONICLE_ films:
    -   _Mask of Light_ ends with the discovery of a strange underground sea and island, Metru Nui. The appropriately titled prequel, _Legends of Metru Nui_, tells the story of how it was abandoned.
    -   _Legends of Metru Nui_ has an attempted hook before the climax. Lhikan drops the revelation the the evil Makuta was originally a protector just like him. This was intended as a setup for more prequel films told in backwards order, one of which would have delved into Makuta's origin and his turn to evil. After LEGO's market research showed that kids were confused by prequel stories, this flashback film was scrapped, and the backstories of Lhikan, Makuta and others were told via books, comics and online stories. Instead, _LOMN_'s credits ended with Makuta's eyes lighting up to set up his return, which didn't surprise anyone, given that the film was a prequel. In place of the unmade origin movie, _Web of Shadows_ was produced, which explained how Makuta escaped from his crystal prison after _LOMN_.
    -   _The Legend Reborn_ ends with Mata Nui and the other heroes discovering that uniting the settlements of Bara Magna (literally, by pulling them together) creates a Humongous Mecha and that the patterns on a stray coin and on the shield of a defeated Skrall soldier depict a map. They set out to find where it leads, with Mata Nui's friends determined to accompany him... and the toy-line got canceled, the sequel scrapped, so the story had to be wrapped up in a comic in which Mata Nui left his friends behind due to the page-limit.
-   _Freddie as F.R.O.7_ had a _huge_ one at the end with Freddie's evil aunt escaping and him getting called over to Washington D.C. There was in fact, already a sequel in the works, but it got shelved when the movie didn't do well and the American release cut half the hook out.
-   In _Frozen II_, Olaf asks if the whole "putting us in mortal danger" thing is going to be a regular occurrence, but Elsa just laughs and says "No, we're done." Didn't stop Disney from green lighting a third movie anyway.
-   The _Challenge Of The Go Bots_ movie _GoBots: Battle of the Rock Lords_ had Magmar, leader of the malevolent Rock Lords, survive his battle against the Guardians and the benevolent Rock Lords and vowing revenge as well as Marbles, one of the benevolent Rock Lords, state that he's sure they'll meet the Guardians again someday.
-   _Hoodwinked!_ ends with Red, Granny, Wolf, and Twitchy getting invited to join the Happily Ever After Agency by Nicky Flippers. _Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil_ would follow up on this plot point.
-   _The Incredibles_ ends with The Underminer arising from the Earth's surface and threatening an all-out war against humanity; the film's sequel, _Incredibles 2_, picks up from this exact place in the story, while ending on a similarly cliff-hanging note at the end.
-   _Kung Fu Panda_:
    -   _Kung Fu Panda_: In hindsight, the blatant Unreveal of why Po the panda has a goose for a father could be considered the Sequel Hook for the first film, this question finally being answered in the second.
    -   _Kung Fu Panda 2_, however, ended on a _definite_ Sequel Hook with The Reveal that Po's biological father and several other pandas survived the genocide of their kind, setting off _Kung Fu Panda 3_.
-   _The LEGO Movie_ ends with the Duplo aliens coming to Bricksburg. The sequel that came out five years later, _The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part_, does begin with that scene but then immediately fast-forwards to, well, five years later, where it's shown that the aliens have turned the city into a desolate Mad Max-esque landscape called "Apocalypseburg''.
-   _The Lion King (1994)_ has Simba and Nala giving birth. It works as a Bookends, as it's how the film started and continues the theme of the Circle of Life, but it also sets up a new character for the following film.
-   _Puss in Boots: The Last Wish_ ends with Puss, Kitty, and Perrito visiting the Kingdom of Far Far Away, setting up a possible reunion between Puss and Shrek.
-   The Stinger at the end of _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Rainbow Rocks_ features Human Twilight Sparkle's investigating the magical happenings at CHS, setting up the third film.
    -   Just before the credits roll in _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Legend of Everfree_, Sunset wonders where the Equestrian magic that hit the rock quarry cave came from. Cue a shot of the portal to Equestria, still cracked from the events of the previous film, leaking several colorful swirls of Equestrian magic, setting up the magic source for the major villains of the upcoming specials and future Equestria Girls movies.
-   Invoked at the end of _The Rescuers_ where the child in distress at the end of the film is actually implied to be from Australia.
-   _Scooby-Doo! and the Reluctant Werewolf_ ends with Shaggy stating that he and Scooby are through with werewolves, vampires, and monsters forever. Dracula and the Hunch Bunch beg to differ.
    
    **Dracula**: That's what he thinks!  
    **Dracula and the Hunch Bunch**: We're back!
    
-   Parodied in _The Simpsons Movie_, where the family is watching the credits at the end. Maggie's first word is "Sequel."
-   _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_ ends with Miles in his dorm listening to music when a portal suddenly opens up above him, with Gwen's voice asking Miles if he's got a minute.
-   In _The Super Mario Bros. Movie_, Peach's backstory prior to ending in the Mushroom Kingdom is yet to be resolved, plus though she and Mario end the story as close friends, some of their Ship Tease moments already laid out groundwork for their friendship to eventually blossom into romance. Also in the post-credit scene, a Yoshi egg is shown to be hatching in the sewer. On top of all this, a lot of other major charters from the Mario Franchise (such as Princess Daisy) never made an appearance in the first film, setting them up to be major characters for future Mario Bros films and maybe even spin off games like Luigi's Mansion.
-   Subverted in _Superman: Brainiac Attacks_; after Superman finishes pummeling Brainiac's body into scrap, the chip that remains of the original Brainiac is seen ominously blinking amidst the wreckage...until Superman's fist comes down on it, smashing it to pieces.
-   Played straight in _Superman: Doomsday_: Lex Luthor, having been seemingly killed by the Superman clone earlier in the movie, turns up in a body cast at the end, musing over whether or not Superman is really impossible to destroy.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem_: The Stinger features the reveal that Dr. Utrom is spying on the Turtles, and is considering hiring "The Shredder" to hunt them down and bring them to her.
-   _TMNT_ ends with Karai suggesting a familiar face from the past will return, suggesting a sequel to the 2007 film would've featured the return of The Shredder.
-   _Toy Story_ has "wow, a puppy!" _Toy Story 2_ has "worried about Andy?" _Toy Story 3_ avoids this. Even so, there was a _Toy Story 4_. Said film also notably averts this, but that didn't stop a fifth movie from being announced.
-   The _Winx Club_ movie _The Secret of the Lost Kingdom_ ends with The Reveal that in the process of Bloom destroying Mandragora and the Obsidian Circle, she unknowingly freed the spirits of the Ancestral Witches, who search for new hosts to possess, and turn to their descendants: the Trix. This issue was later solved in the second movie, _Magical Adventure_.

    Literature 

### **By Author:**

-   Dale Brown has various hooks in his book-endings. For example, _Battle Born_ ended with the Dreamland staffers offering Rebecca Furness command of a new unit, while _Air Battle Force_ ended on the then Russian president threatening another war with the Americans.
-   Dante Alighieri:
    -   In Canto 5 of _Dante's Paradiso_, Dante asks the identity of a supernaturally glad soul from Mercury, only for the narration to tell us that this soul will only sing in the next canto.
    -   The _Vita Nuova_ ends with a reference to an unseen vision which inspires the poet to praise his deceased beloved in ways never achieved before. Nine years later, that inspiration would bear fruit with the first canto of the _Inferno_.
-   Rick Riordan:
    -   _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_ has a not so prominent one at the end of the last book, when the new resident Oracle spouts another prophecy. Though it is almost immediately Hand Waved with a "who knows when it could happen or if it's even about you guys" speech, it's pretty obvious that it will lead to a sequel series, which it has.
    -   _The Heroes of Olympus_ has a Sequel Hook in every installment besides the third, which is a straight up cliffhanger.
        -   _The Lost Hero_'s ending has Jason deducing that Percy is at Camp Jupiter.
        -   _The Son of Neptune_ ending has a holographic scroll made by Leo being found by Percy, as The Argo II flies into Camp Jupiter, signalling that the Seven spoken of in the Prophecy of Seven are about to unite.
        -   _The House of Hades_ has the looming threat of Gaea rising on August 1st and Nico, Reyna, and Coach Hedge going on a journey to shadow travel the Athena Parthenos back to Camp Half-Blood.
        -   _The Blood of Olympus_ ends with Apollo being teleported to Olympus for an unknown punishment by Zeus. Meanwhile, the Oracle's gift of prophecy is still unable to be accessed by Rachel. Both of these lead into _The Trials of Apollo_.

### **By Work:**

-   The first book of the _Ahriman Trilogy_ has one of the more obvious ones: "And she was going to summon a god."
-   _Alternate Routes_ by Tim Powers ends with an epilogue in which the two protagonists go their separate ways but arrange a way that they can get back in touch with each other if it should be necessary, and it's mentioned in passing that they've each started manifesting a new psychic power as a consequence of the experience they've just been through. Powers's next novel, _Forced Perspectives_, is the first direct and immediate sequel of his career, bringing the same two characters back together a year later for another adventure, in which their new powers play a significant part.
-   _Anno Dracula 1899: One Thousand Monsters_ ends with an invitation to a millenium party at the location of the novel, setting up the Time Skip of _Anno Dracula 1999: Daikaiju_. It, in turn, ended with a scene that was tied to the climax of the novel, but mostly involved a completely different group of people facing an entirely seperate villain in another country. The first indicated "Christina Light's story will continue", the second "Now that the Christina Light story is over, here's what we're going to do next".
-   The _Death Note_ novel _Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases_ has a note by the narrator in the final chapter saying that, if he had more time, he would write about two other stories L told him. A pretty blatant set-up for more novels like it.
-   Each book in J.R. Ward's crack-like _Black Dagger Brotherhood_ series features a Sequel Hook embedded as the B- or C-plot of the current book. You'll be fiending for the next book before you've even finished the one you're on.
-   The end of the comic neo-noir _City of Devils_ has Nick's next case coming through the door: the witch Hexene Candlemas, hiring him to find her toad. The sequel does in fact follow up on this hook and sets one up of its own, with the LAPD hauling in the private detective to work for them.
-   The epilogue of _Crime and Punishment_ warns that the redemption of Raskolnikov, now enduring the punishment for his crime, will not be given to him for free, that there is suffering ahead before his eventual renewal and discovery of a life he never new existed...but that's another story for another time.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Daemon_ ends with Sebeck and companion setting off on a road trip across America, leading into their part of _Freedom_.
-   _The Dinosaur Lords_ clearly likes its sequel hooks.
    -   In book one:
        -   Melodía going towards Providence to hide from Falk.
        -   Karyl and Rob getting thrown to jail in their last scene.
        -   The Emperor implying that his confessor knew about Falk's plan all along.
        -   Most of all, the Cryptic Conversation between Raguel and Uriel.
    -   Book two manages to trump all that with the last-scene reveal that Emperor's confessor was a Grey Angel all along.
-   All three of Terry Pratchett's Moist von Lipwig _Discworld_ novels contain sequel hooks, but only the first one of them was picked up on. In _Going Postal_, the Patrician Lord Vetinari is seen making an offer to one Reacher Gilt to reform the Royal Mint in the same manner as the Post Office had been in the book. This task was eventually undertaken by Lipwig in _Making Money_, and at the end of that one Vetinari muses how useful an asset Lipwig has proved to be and also how the City's tax system is in dire need of reform. But the third Lipwig novel turned out to be _Raising Steam_, and is about trains rather than taxes. _It_ ends with a Goblin inventor showing the Patrician his new prototype bicycle. This hook never got used due to Pratchett having Died During Production.
-   Two examples from _Distortionverse_:
    -   The last section of _Chapter 5 - Rumori di Fondo_ in which it is revealed that _doll_ #4 is still alive.
    -   The ending of _Chapter 2 - Rosenmaester_, which is the connection between this novel and the previous one. In the last chapter, the Big Bad is seen wandering through the city in a semi-unconscious state, while actually still being alive. This actually makes sense, since _Chapter 1 - La Notte che Cammina_ is set one year later than _Rosenmaester_.
-   Happens several times in the _Dora Wilk Series_:
    -   _Gods Must Be Crazy_ ends with Raphael declaring open war with Dora.
    -   _Winner Takes It All_ has the Trio find out about some unspecified vampire problem and setting out to solve it.
    -   _Exorcisms of Dora Wilk_ closes with Dora having a dream of Varg being kidnapped.
-   _Dragonlance_: The hook involved with the _Kang's Regiment_ books is rather unusual in that it's not only in the second of the existing books (that number _itself_ implies a third volume, because _Dragonlance_ multi-part novels almost always come in groups of 3) but in the ending of the War Of Souls trilogy. In _Draconian Measures_, the city Kang is trying to reach so he can found a Draconian civilization is named Teyr. The readers know from material set chronologically later that Teyr is a Draconian city, and there's an interesting bit in _Dragons of the Vanished Moon_ where a bunch of Draconians from Teyr show up and fight _against_ Takhisis and her forces (keep in mind, Kang starts out as a faithful servant of Takhisis, so this is a Heel–Face Turn for him). Two unnamed but familiar Draconians appear among the collection of enemies Takhisis magics to her to watch the moment of her triumph, as well.
-   Quite prevalent in _The Dresden Files_:
    -   _Changes_ had Harry getting shot and dying as the last scene in the book.
    -   _Ghost Story_ has Harry set to head to the Sidhe Court as the Winter Knight to do as Mab bids, leaving his friends not knowing that he did not die.
-   The epilogue-like last chapter of _Ender's Game_ is titled "Speaker for the Dead", and was written to set up the identically-named sequel to the book.
-   The sudden appearance of the Blatant Beast at the end of Book V of _The Faerie Queene_ sets up his role as antagonist of Book Six.
-   At the end of _Ffangs the Vampire Bat and the Kiss of Truth_, the newly-human titular character's sister is kidnapped, and he sets off to rescue her, with the last line being "(The adventures of Ffangs will be continued in the next book)". The sequel was never written.
-   On the last page of _Foundation and Earth_, Isaac Asimov sets up a sequel (in a way that is somewhat difficult to summarize briefly or without massive spoilers). Unfortunately, he didn't actually have any definite ideas for that sequel and he died before he could come up with one.
-   The explicitly referenced buildup of magic at the other end of the Grand Bow River in Patricia C. Wrede's _Frontier Magic_.
-   _The Girl from the Miracles District_:
    -   The first book ends with Nikita finding a note telling her to find "the truth" in a distant location.
    -   The second book's ending has Nikita telling Robin that she knows a guy who can get them to the Archive, where the secret of Robin's identity is hidden.
-   _Girls Kingdom_'s fourth book ends on a note that Misaki had no idea how crazy things were going to get soon. So far, no fifth book has been published.
-   After the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone is destroyed at the end of the first _Harry Potter_ book, Dumbledore says that there are still other ways Voldemort can return. Voldemort spends the rest of the series proving Dumbledore right.
    -   _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_ ends with Harry deciding to leave Hogwarts to find and destroy the Horcruxes that will make Voldemort vulnerable, which tells the reader that the series' traditional formula will be thrown by the wayside for the final installment.
    -   Some fans really hope that the controversial epilogue is one of these, despite the author saying that it is not. It's practically an _anti_\- sequel hook, since it seems to only exist to assure us that they all lived Happily Ever After.
-   The last chapter of the first book of _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ is essentially an advertisement for the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. The place was encountered in the radio series immediately after the episodes adapted into the first book; the second book was indeed named _The Restaurant at the End of the Universe_ but did not reach the Restaurant until the middle. It's been claimed that the last chapter was added on by the editors to wrap up the completed pages after Adams missed his deadline.
-   Believe it or not, J. R. R. Tolkien adjusted _The Hobbit_ in a later edition to help it be the prequel of _The Lord of the Rings_. Which would make it a Retcon Sequel Hook. In the first edition, Gollum was _honest_ in the riddle game and showed Bilbo the way out of the caves in recompense when he realized he could not give him the ring.
-   _Imminent Danger and How To Fly Straight into It_ ends this way, with Eris deciding to leave behind her life on Earth, and return to exploring the stars with Varrin. The villains have been defeated and the heroes look set to live happily ever after...and then Eris learns that the pendant Varrin gave her means they are now technically married. And she's not happy about it.
-   _Jurassic Park_ ended with one of these where Dr. Grant, being kept in Costa Rica by their government who was still investigating the Isla Nublar incident, is approached by an agent of the U.S. government about a path of destruction being carved through South America by a group of 'strange reptiles' that are swarming farms and devouring plants with lysine, the amino acid Hammond had all the dinosaurs bred to be dependent upon. Unfortunately this hook was ignored and the followup book was a sequel to the movie.
-   At the end of _The Magic Map_, after David has spent the past 31 chapters getting to know the Western Hemisphere, Geography tells David that he'll be having another adventure in the Living Map soon, this time in the _Eastern_ Hemisphere. After this is said, David wakes up.
-   In _MARZENA_ during the final dream sequence of Book 1, Lauren must chase after the shadow of a woman with black hair, going through a rain of fire, ice and blood and other weird alien symbolism. The Narrator, who we have never met in the book and who we know almost next to nothing about, admits at the end that the shadow woman was her and that Marian was once like a sister to her. We still know next to nothing about their relationship.
-   _The Mister_ ends with Alessia's father demanding that Maxim and Alessia marry in four days; they're fine with this but Maxim remarks that when they get back to the UK, they'll have to deal with his mother's reaction to their hasty marriage.
-   _The Mouse Watch_ has one in an epilogue. We're introduced to Kryptos, the mysterious leader of R.A.T.S., who says that he anticipated the failure of Dr. Thornpaw's Evil Plan and is ready to launch another scheme.
-   _Murderess_ ends with the introduction of a character named Tyler Killer, who is apparently very evil and probably not too bright, but extremely dangerous nonetheless.
-   _Myth Adventures_: At the end of _Hit or Myth_, Skeeve reveals to Aahz that their new residence has a hidden, heavily-padlocked back door to an unknown dimension. Sure enough, they find out what's on the other side in the next novel, _Myth-ing Persons_.
-   _The Night of the Triffids_ ends with the protagonists, who live in one of the few surviving enclaves after the collapse of civilization, receiving a radio signal from another, previously unknown, group of survivors, and making plans for an expedition to find them.
-   _Parellity_ ends with the main plot hook resolved, but some hanging threads, including Atlantis, what plans Abend has for Harborage and the gang, and everything to do with the Vaccine. Not to mention whatever the _fuck_ was going on in chapter one.
-   The epilogue of _The Radiant Dawn_ sets up for a potential sequel involving the alien race aboard the orbiting ship.
-   In the _Rainbow Magic_ series, the Weather Fairies series ended with the girls receiving the fairy lockets, which promised many adventures ahead.
-   _Rendezvous with Rama_: After a mysterious alien object passes through the solar system, the book ends with the portentous sentence, 'The Ramans do everything in threes'. (Whether or not a second Rama, let alone a third, is presented in the sequels at all is debatable.) In a subversion, Clarke admitted that it was just a throwaway line; he never actually intended to write a sequel. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _The Tarot Sequence_: The first book of the series, _The Last Sun_, sets up three hooks, one of which would be central to the next book, and two others that set up larger, series spamming plots:
    -   The first one: Matthias reveals that he was promised to marry The Hanged Man, who still wants him, to Rune and Brand's displeasure.
    -   The second one: Rune reveals he has a secret apartment in town, which he uses as base of operation in a 20 year long investigation to find the 9 men that assaulted him and destroyed his house.
    -   The third one: The Hermit appears to Rune, to cryptically warn him he is part of a prophecy.
-   _Thursday Next_ is full of these, but they're so tongue-in-cheek and playful, they don't even seem like marketing gimmicks. One happens at the end of _First Among Sequels_, when Thursday discovers that since someone has been trying to get rid of literary serials, there's a serial killer loose in the Book World!
-   _Trigger Warning_: After Jake, a military veteran college student, completes the book's Die Hard in a university plot, he meets a minor character who was killing terrorists at the same time as him, Dog, who suddenly reveals himself to be his long-lost uncle. Dog then regales him for several pages about his backstory, the secret government initiative that allows him to roam the country killing bad guys at his discretion, and the suped-up truck he drives while doing so. Dog then recruits Jake to team up with him, and the book ends. Guess we'll have to wait for a sequel to learn about their thrilling adventures!
-   _A True History_ by Lucian, considered one of the earliest Science Fiction stories, ends with the promise of a sequel.
-   At the end of _The Ultra Violets_ book 2, _Power to the Purple_, it's revealed that Opal and her mother have samples of the Iris', Scarlet's, and Cheri's hair at BeauTek. Given the company's reputation for reckless genetic engineering, this is _very_ worrying, to say the least.
-   At the end of _Urfin Jus and His Wooden Soldiers_, we get a glimpse of Ruf Bilan the traitor escaping his cell and fleeing into the underground tunnels. He goes on to kickstart the conflict of _Seven Underground Kings_.
-   During the course of James Swallow's _Warhammer 40,000_ novel _Red Fury_, Fabius Bile obtained some of the "sacred vitae" from the Blood Angels. During the Dénouement, Dante informs Rafen of this, and sends him after it.

    Live-Action TV 

### **Series:**

-   _The 100_ tends to combine this with Saved for the Sequel, wherein a secondary plotline is given a major twist at the end of each season, and then becomes the main focus of the next season.
    -   Season 1: The Mountain Men, frequently mentioned to be an enemy of the Grounders, capture the remaining delinquents using modern technology after the climactic battle.
    -   Season 2: Murphy and Jaha search for the City of Light, only to find the AI A.L.I.E., responsible for the nuclear devastation a century ago.
    -   Season 3: While shutting down A.L.I.E. for good, Clarke finds out that remaining nuclear reactors are breaking down, and the deadly radiation will cover the entire planet in a matter of months.
    -   Season 4: There are several mentions of the Eligus Mining Corporation across the season, which pays off when one of their spaceships shows up in the final scene.
    -   Season 5: Everyone enters cryo-sleep to wait for Earth to recover. Clarke and Bellamy are awoken to find that Monty and Harper figured out that Earth wouldn’t recover and died of old age on the ship, leaving behind their son Jordan. However, they also figured out where to find another habitable planet, and the ship has just arrived there.
    -   Season 6: The Anomaly goes crazy after Gabriel finally figures out how to interact with it. Diozya’s now-teenage daughter Hope suddenly appears and tells Octavia that her mother has been captured by "him" and stabs her, resulting in Octavia turning into mist and vanishing. Also, Octavia seems to be unsurprised by any of it despite not recalling any of her previous time in the Anomaly.
-   _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._:
    -   Season 1 ends with quite a few dangling threads for Season 2 to pick up on: Coulson is now Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and tasked with rebuilding the organization after the HYDRA infiltration; meanwhile, he has started to compulsively draw the same alien symbols that Garrett did after taking the GH325 serum. Fitz, meanwhile, is left in critical condition after his near-Heroic Sacrifice, with his future uncertain. At the same time, both Quinn and Raina escape Garrett's downfall, the former still in possession of the gravitonium, and the latter getting in touch with a mysterious figure who is apparently Skye's father. There's also a nice subversion, where Garret starts to augment himself with cybernetic implants after everyone assumed he was dead. Right as it seems like he's going to be an even bigger threat for the second season, Coulson pops out of nowhere and casually vaporizes him mid-villain speech.
    -   Season 2 ends with Coulson tasking Skye with putting together a team together to deal with the rise of the Inhumans, and Simmons being absorbed by the Kree artifact.
    -   Season 3 ends with a six month Time Skip, revealing that in the interim, Skye has gone rogue and become a vigilante, and is being chased by Coulson, who is no longer Director of SHIELD.
    -   Season 4 ends with Team Coulson being abducted by mysterious government agents and finding themselves in space.
-   The final episode of _Akumaizer 3_ has the titular Power Trio defeating the Final Boss, but in the process to pull an effective Heroic Sacrifice to do so and the finale ends with the capsules containing their souls slowly floating away. This sets up the plot of the Sequel Series _Choujin Bibyun_, in which the Akumaizer 3's souls imbue three humans with their power so they can continue defending humanity.
-   _Alex Rider_: Kyra has run off somewhere, and it's not clear what her plans are. Yassen Gregorovitch is working for Scorpia, who Blunt thought had been defeated long ago. Yassen has seen Alex, and seems to know who he is.
-   _Arrested Development_ ends with Maeby meeting with director Ron Howard and pitching the story of her family as a TV show. In an obvious bit of foreshadowing, the final line of dialogue has Howard saying the story might work better as a movie. Sure enough, the series has been Un-Cancelled for at least one season by Netflix.
    -   The new season itself ends with a number of hooks for more episodes, such as George Michael apparently having impregnated a woman in Spain, Buster being accused of murdering Lucille 2, the web vigilante group Anonymous coming after the family, and Lindsay getting into politics.
-   _The Doctor Blake Mysteries_: The very second episode, "The Greater Good", ends with the murderer caught — but Blake and Lawson realize that he was working on behalf of someone else who let him shoulder all the blame, and wonder who that might be. There would eventually be a Sequel Episode that followed up on this.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The oldest stories usually ended like this. The first story, "An Unearthly Child", has the TARDIS land on another planet and the radiation meter rise without the TARDIS crew seeing.
    -   The Renaissance-set 1970s story "The Masque of Mandragora" ended with the Doctor warning that the titular Eldritch Abomination would be able to attack Earth again When the Planets Align towards the end of the twentieth century. This was never followed up in TV continuity, but has had several different Expanded Universe follow-ups.
    -   "Doomsday" set up for "The Runaway Bride" via Donna Noble suddenly appearing inside the TARDIS.
    -   "Evolution of the Daleks" ends with Dalek Caan, last surviving member of the Cult of Skaro, escaping. The Doctor tells Martha that he has no doubt that they will meet again.
    -   "Last of the Time Lords" has two:
        -   After the Master's dead body is consigned to the flames in an attempt to prevent him from ever regenerating, the Doctor leaves. Then we see a woman's hand pull the Master's ring out of the ashes.
        -   The last scene sets up "Voyage of the Damned" (and indirectly, "Time Crash") by having the TARDIS suddenly crash into, of all things, the _Titanic_.
    -   "The Doctor's Daughter": After her apparent death, Jenny revives and steals a spaceship to see the universe, just like Dad. She has yet to reappear on the TV show, but has made a few Expanded Universe appearances.
    -   "Silence in the Library"/"Forest of the Dead" sets up future appearances of the mysterious River Song by leaving almost everything about her unanswered.
    -   "Planet of the Dead": Once everyone's back on Earth, Carmen the psychic gives the Doctor a very ominous prophecy.
        
        "It is returning, returning through the dark. Oh, and Doctor...he will knock four times."
        
    -   "The End of Time" set up for "The Eleventh Hour" (though in a sense every regeneration episode except "Time and the Rani" is a _de facto_ Sequel Hook) by having the badly-damaged TARDIS falling towards Earth.
    -   Steven Moffat said that "The Big Bang" set up for the _entirety_ of Series 6 through the still-lingering mystery of the Silence.
    -   The finale of series 6, "The Wedding of River Song", blows them all away with the reveal of the First Question. The Oldest Question in the Universe. The Question That Must Never Be Answered. That question is: _Doctor Who?_
    -   "Mummy on the Orient Express": The AI Gus has gotten away, with his boss unidentified. And they know who and what the Doctor is, and know how the Foretold worked, which is what they wanted.
    -   "The Return of Doctor Mysterio" ends with the alien brain posing as the German doctor escaping into the body of a UNIT soldier.
-   At the end of the first season of _Emerald City_, Jane sends Dorothy back to Kansas against her will, but later Lucas comes to take her back to Oz because Jane has been taken prisoner by the Beast Forever.
-   Season 1 of _Happy!_ ends with a stinger wherein Zombie!Mikey visits Mr. Blue in prison and finally delivers the password to him. This results in him becoming possessed.
-   _Heroes_
    -   Sylar's body disappearing at the end of Season 1. _Heroes_ loved this trope.
    -   After Hiro Nakamura defeats Adam Monroe, he's shown trapped in a coffin, still alive; a clear indication that the character would return to menace the heroes at some point later.
-   The first season of _Lexx_ ends with the heroes slaying the Gigashadow and escaping into the Dark Zone ready to find a new home. As Xev embraces Kai, the camera zooms in on his face and a shadow flickers across his eyes...
-   _Merlin_: Arthur's gone, but there _is_ that legend of how he'll return when Britain needs him most. Plus, Merlin's still alive in the present day...
-   The eleventh episode of _Once Upon a Time_ season 3 seems like the series finale — until a Sequel Hook is brought by - who else - Captain Hook. A Sequel HOOK.
-   _Power Rangers Turbo_ ends on a shock: Divatox defeats the Power Rangers utterly and entirely. Thus, to try and ensure the earth's safety before The United Alliance of Evil returns, they get a space shuttle, and launch into space, setting up _Power Rangers in Space_.
-   The second season finale of _Pretty Little Liars_ ends with Mona being revealed as A. The scene ends with her sitting alone in a room in The Radley before telling someone in a red coat "I did everything you asked me to."
-   At the end of the _Red Dwarf_ episode "Polymorph", after the crew defeats the eponymous creature, it is revealed that a second one has made it on board. Subverted in the remastered version, in which on-screen text reveals that this one, much less intelligent than the first, took up residence harmlessly in Lister's underwear drawer and eventually died of old age. Doubly subverted by the episode _Emohawk: Polymorph II_ three series later in which they meet another one.
-   _Root into Europe_: The final episode has Mr. and Mrs. Root consider going on vacation to the United States next, but this hint to a sequel never came about.
-   _The School Nurse Files_ ends with Radi asking Eun-young to see her mother, who sees ghosts.
-   _Scream_: Season 1 ends with the reveal that Audrey was working with and/or for the defeated and killed Ghostface killer all along.
-   At the end of _Slasher_ season one, the mystery of the Executioner's identity has been solved and Sarah's house is being shown to its new tenants, a couple and their young daughter. In the last scene, the little girl casually breaks a cat's neck.
-   _Stargate SG-1_ specifically left the door open on the Ori threat in its final episode, for the express purpose of setting up the follow up movie _Stargate: The Ark of Truth_.
    -   Word of God is that they were, for the first time ever, _not_ expecting to be cancelled, so they didn't wrap up the current plotlines. Oops.
-   A television show can do this with its story arcs; alerting you that just because the episode ends, the plotline will continue. Take the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "Q Who". The _Enterprise_ has narrowly escaped The Borg by the skin of their teeth. As Captain Picard and Guinan discuss their near-defeat, Guinan points out that humanity was never supposed to encounter them (the Borg) that early. But since they have....
    
    **Guinan**: Of course, now...they know of your existence.  
    **Picard (with understanding dawning)**: They're... _coming_...
    
    -   The first season's "Conspiracy", one of the darkest episodes of the series, ends with the alien infiltrators defeated, but not without evidence that they sent some of distress call. The intent was to have a sequel; however, aspects of it were instead incorporated into the Borg stories.
    -   The sixth season's "Schisms" also ends with a similar possibility of a sequel, but due to no one being satisfied with how that episode turned out after it took a budget cut, that was dropped.
    -   The end of the original series episode "Space Seed" became quite literally a Sequel Hook nearly 20 years later for _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_.
-   _Stranger Things_
    -   The Season 1 finale was originally supposed to make it clear that Eleven made a Heroic Sacrifice, killing the monster at the cost of her own life. However, when the show was renewed for a second season, the creators decided to make her death much more ambiguous, it being a case of Never Found the Body. Hopper is later seen placing Eggos, Eleven's Trademark Favorite Food, in a box in the woods, hinting that she is alive. Also, Will is seen coughing up a slug from the Upside-Down and his surroundings briefly flash into a resemblance of their Upside-Down counterparts, but it's left ambiguous whether or not he just imagined it. Hopper is approached by The Men in Black, but since he is still working as the town's chief of police after that, it seems he's managed to cut some kind of a deal with them. All storylines are addressed in the next season.
    -   Season 2 cleans up most of the loose ends from Season 1, but leaves a few loose ends of it's own.
        -   It ends with the child characters dancing at the Snow Ball, but the camera then pans to the Upside-Down where a new monster is seen watching over the school, very much alive.
        -   Joyce, Nancy, and Jonathan exorcise the Mind Flayer's "virus" mist from Will, but it is not seen to be destroyed and instead flies off into the night.
        -   Kali is still out there, abusing her psychic abilities for personal gain and revenge, and may have an issue with Eleven after the latter fled in chapter 7.
        -   Finally, Dr. Brenner may still be alive, if the scientist tracked down by Kali and Eleven is to be believed.
    -   In Season 3:
        -   In The Stinger, the Russian Black Site's occupants include an "American", and a live, full-grown demogorgon.
        -   Additionally, very few of the hooks from Season 2 are resolved in Season 3; the Mind Flayer is presumably still perfectly fine in the Upside-Down (and likely more pissed-off than ever), and Kali and potentially Dr. Brenner are still out there. The bit of the Mind Flayer that was exorcised from Will may have been destroyed when the new gate was sealed and its body was killed, but even that isn't confirmed; it persisted without a body and without a connection to the Upside-Down between seasons 2 and 3, after all.
-   _The Wrong Mans_: The car bomb at the end of series 1.

### **TV Movies:**

-   The obscure UPN TV special _Monster Trux 2000 - The New Thrillenium_ ends with the antagonist, "Big Daddy", in the Bigfoot monster truck saying "We'll be back!" and then letting out a Evil Laugh - possibly meant as a setup for a second event. The event was panned by the monster truck fandom and thus the event never happened.

    Mythology 

-   Older Than Feudalism: In _The Odyssey_, the prophet Tiresias tells Odysseus that he must make another journey after returning home, but this was not followed up on by Homer. That journey only appears in the lost _Telegony_, the last epic of The Trojan Cycle.

    Podcasts 

-   The first arc of the _Cool Kids Table_ game _Small Magic_ ends with the party reaching a windmill and finding a statue holding the spirit of…an oni? A tenshi? The spirit praises the kindness they've demonstrated and enlarges Byrb, allowing them all to fly to the Heavenly City.

    Tabletop Games 

-   One of the possible outcomes for whenever The Stinger comes up in a game of _Die Laughing_ is a sequel hook, determined by the player whose character died first in the session.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Although the Abyss storyline comes to a conclusive finish with the defeat of the Dogmatika Order, the final cards for the storyline reveal that there are still plot threads unresolved. Namely, Aluber is still alive and plotting his next move, while the 666 spirits of the Dogmatika Saints have fully manifested in the form of Guiding Quem, the Virtuous. Albaz and Ecclesia are also seen embarking on a brand-new adventure at the very end of the story with a new friend in tow.

    Theatre 

-   _Henry IV, Part 1_ ends with news that Northumberland and Archbishop Scroop are arming for war.
    -   You'd think the "Part 1" in the title would kind of give away that a sequel was intended as well...
-   _Henry VI Part 3_ ends with Richard of Gloucester's (the future King Richard III) monologue where he talks about how he'll do anything to gain control of the crown- setting up for "Richard III".
-   _Twelfth Night_ end with Malvolio pledging "I’ll be reveng’d on the whole pack of you!" which looks like a good setup for a tragedy to follow this comedy. Sadly, Shakespeare never did anything with it.
    -   It _has_ been argued that the sequel this set up was the real-life closing of the English theaters by the Malvolio-like Puritans.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Arcade Spirits_ has an unanswered mystery revolving around an allegedly haunted arcade game known as "Polybius", with a mysterious individual eager to get their hands on it. So much so, they're willing to acquire the Big Bad in order to do so. There's also an in-universe advertisment for a sequel to Fist of Destruction, while out-of-universe also putting forth the possibility of a sequel to Arcade Spirits itself.
-   _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_ has a particularly plot twisty one where after Junko Enoshima (the Big Bad) is executed, Monokuma (who she was controlling) gets up and asks the viewer if they really thought that was the end.
-   In the “good” Amanda ending of _Daughter for Dessert_, the protagonist and Amanda start up a new diner in Hawaii. Especially since Cecilia still has a grudge against the protagonist, it’s bound to yield some interesting stories. In fact, Word of God confirmed in late 2019 that a second season was in the cards, but no additional updates have been announced as of May 2021.
-   Two routes in _Kissed by the Baddest Bidder_ provide these.
    -   Eisuke's main route mentions his search for his sister, which becomes a major focus of his sequel.
    -   As of the end of Soryu's sequel, there's someone out there somewhere willing to pay handsomely to have Soryu killed, but nobody knows who or why. The sequel also mentions that both of Soryu's parents are AWOL, another plot hook that's likely to be addressed in future content.
-   _Umineko: When They Cry_ provides one in the 8th Tea party. It is yet to be seen if it will play into _Ciconia: When They Cry_
    
    **Lambda and Bern:** We'll meet again...when something else cries.
    

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   From _Arenas_, right after the Vadrigar is Killed Off for Real:.
    
    **Vadrigar**: _You may have me pissed now, but our war hasn't even started. You may end me, but they won't kill me._
    
-   The first season of Hero House ends with Nightwing's murder, which definitely counts.
-   The _KateModern_ special "Precious Blood" ends with "Precious Blood: 10:30PM", which shows that Terrence is still alive and has killed the Watcher.
    -   At the end of "The Last Work", Julia swears revenge on the K-Team, and some of them say they still want to fight.
-   The _lonelygirl15_ Grand Finale "The Ascension" is followed by a short surprise video revealing that Lucy is still at large.
-   Subverted in the _Homestar Runner_ cartoon, _DNA Evidence_. In the end, it turns out that Strong Sad had the DNA Evidence all along, and then laughs maniacally...and then it turns out that Homsar was there, watching him. Somebody unfamiliar with _Homestar Runner_ would guess he'd tell everybody the news, right?
-   At the end of _The Cartoon Man_, both Roy and Karen are cartoonified, while Simon and Valerie get sucked into the Second Dimension. Both plot points play a major role in the follow-up, which itself ends on a major Cliffhanger.
-   _Dusk's Dawn_: We never see what happened to the antagonist, or when the protagonists went to Celestia. However, a new production hasn't been made in years, so it's either been abandoned or stuck in Development Hell.
-   At the end of _Ruby Quest_, minor character Daisy (who was killed pretty early on) wakes up in the same situation as Ruby did in the beginning of the quest, opening up the possiblity that she'll be the protagonist of the next attempt to escape the Metal Glen.
-   _Atop the Fourth Wall_: At the end of the Sleepwalker storyline, a page appears on Linkara's chair saying that he's invited to "A Contest of Champions".
-   The Case of the Gilded Lily ends with Vivian bursting into Fig and Ford's office, saying that terrible something has happened.
-   _Gaming All-Stars_:
    -   Originally, after the moon the moon was destroyed, it left behind three items representing the three heroes who stood up to Andross. In _Remastered_, though, the items suddenly vanish into thin air, leading to a scene in which Mario and several other major protagonists come face-to-face with Zinyak, foreshadowing the events of _Gaming All Stars 2_.
-   The finale of the eight-episode web miniseries _Critters: A New Binge_ has the surviving Crites prepare for Phase 2 of their plan, which appears to involve clones of Christopher.
-   Heavily zig-zagged by _Epic SMP_. Epic SMP was largely a failure, and its finale didn't really leave any room for a sequel given the destruction of the entire server and the death of all but one of its characters, but the trailer for Season 2 takes the Downer Ending of Season 1 and gives us the reveal that the world has been completely reset as a result of SwaggerSouls trying to right what he has done wrong in Season 1.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_: "Attack of the Twonkies" ends with Jimmy realizing he never sent Sheen's Twonkie back (which never mutated due to Sheen's bad singing), which reproduces and its offspring hop into Retroville. However, nothing comes of it and from that point on Twonkies would be hidden in each episode as a Freeze-Frame Bonus.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_
    -   Zuko's question to Ozai at the end of the _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ Grand Finale: "Where is my mother?"
    -   It did technically lead to Sequel Series _The Legend of Korra_...but it takes place over 70 years in the future and most of the former cast is dead. The first episode even trolls the audience about the hook, with a character asking a now elderly Katara about it and her explanation being cut off.
    -   There's also _The Promise_, a graphic novel Interquel trilogy set one year after the end of the War; in first installment, we discover the end of the conversation started by the above hook - which answers _absolutely nothing_. It even ends with the _exact same_ sequel hook, only Zuko is now asking Azula about Mom instead of Ozai. Thankfully, the _next_ comic interquel, _The Search_, has this plot hook as its central premise, so we'll finally get some closure.
        -   And then _The Search_ saddles us with some more: Azula has escaped, and it's unclear whether she'll be redeemed. Also, Zuko and Mai are still broken up, though with that one, _Korra_ implies that they did get back together and had children.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_ did this all the time, particularly in any episode introducing a new villain. There would always be a line at the end in which Batman suspects he hasn't seen the last of the new foe. Perhaps most blatant is the ending to the Ra's Al Ghul two-parter, in which Ra's falls into the Lazarus Pit and is presumed dead, but the final shot shows a hand rising up out of the pit while maniacal laughter is heard.
    -   In one of its multiple crossovers with _Static Shock_, Static asks Batman where Robin went and he replies that he left to join the Teen Titans and that Static would meet them himself soon. However, the planned Teen Titans series for the DCAU never came to pass, but Static did end up joining them in the comics shortly before the New 52 reboot as well as appearing in _Young Justice_.
-   In _Central Park_, the Season 1 finale "A Fish Called Snakehead", when Bitsy is furious that the Tillermans saved the park again and that she's been made a fool after Paige had her story printed about Dick Flake's fake fish, she's now determined to buy both Central Park _and_ Paige's newspaper "What's New, New York". Helen immediately points out that newspapers are no longer profitable, but Bitsy admits it would be pleasing to fire everyone. And as Birdie sings at the end:
    
    _Thanks to this family_  
    _The park is secure now,_  
    _But thinking it's over_  
    _Is quite premature now..._
    
-   _Clone High_: As part of the parody of the horror genre, the last shot of the episode "Anxious Times at Clone High" is of the killer rabbit is seen hopping into the empty Heebie Jeebie suit, which promptly comes to life and puts its head back on.
-   _Danny Phantom_ with the episode "The Ultimate Enemy", where the Big Bad is shown to be contained, but not entirely defeated, as he was trying to bust out. The series ended before the writers could actually make good on that story thread, however (though it is gonna be picked up in the graphic novel, however).
-   The _Family Guy_ Chicken Fights all end with the battered, mutilated, frequently shredded chicken opening one of its heavily blackened eyes. Even after it's been sucked through a jet engine, or pounded into submission with a saucepan, or...
-   _Gravity Falls_
    -   "Gideon Rises": The Season Finale has Grunkle Stan revealed to be the owner of Journal 1, and he uses all three journals to activate a mysterious portal in the hidden basement of the Mystery Shack. The original airing punctuates this by having the character say that "Gravity Falls will return" over the end credits, though we don't discover the portal's purpose until "Not What He Seems" half a season later.
    -   "Scaryoke": The government agents Dipper called are revealed to have survived the zombie attack, which is enough confirmation for them to investigate Gravity Falls. The next several episodes have them in the background before they make their formal return in "Not What He Seems."
    -   "Weirdmageddon": The Grand Finale has Dipper opening the note he got from Wendy, which has the entire town thanking the twins and hoping they'll return next summer. The Stinger shows Bill Cipher as a live-action statue in the middle of the woods, implying that he would someday return too...
    -   Also from the finale, as Bill is dying, he shouts out a phrase in backwards speech: A-X-O-L-O-T-L/HEY X-O-L-O-T-L, MY TIME HAS COME TO BURN, I INVOKE THE ANCIENT POWER THAT I MAY RETURN. Interestingly enough, while this is a clear reference to Alex Hirsch frequently responding with a picture of an Axolotl when asked, Xolotl is the name of the Aztec god of death...and _twins._
-   In _Jackie Chan Adventures_, after Jade destroys Shendu with one of his own Talismans, Uncle reveals that when an evil is destroyed, a new evil can fill the void, possibly being even more dangerous. The next season deals with Shendu's siblings forcing his spirit (which survived his body's destruction, likely due to the Sheep Talisman or demons naturally become spirits once they die), to take advantage of this void (via an ancient artifact), by using it to release them from their otherworldy prison so they can reconquer the world.
-   _Justice League_ set up its second season as possibly the last, so they ended it in a truly epic finale with the watchtower base being destroyed. At the end and after Hawkgirl resigns from the League, Superman asks what they are going to do now, which Batman replies with "We rebuild." This leads into _Justice League Unlimited_, but was enough to be considered And the Adventure Continues.
-   _Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts_: "Beyond the Valley of the Dogs", the Season 1 finale, ends with Kipo's father, who has the answers about her mutations, captured by the villain, and the gang riding out to rescue him.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   The story normally takes place in such a way that any episode can happen any day, but Season 3's premiere ends like this, with Princess Celestia nodding at Princess Luna, who magically summons a book with stars and swirls on the cover.
    -   The season 3 finale (which incidentally pays off said Star Swirl sequel hook) definitely is trying to draw you in for season 4. Twilight turns into an alicorn and is now a princess of Equestria. According to the writer's twitter, she considers this episode the first in a 3-parter. The 2-part season 4 premiere serves as the final two parts.
    -   Considering season 5 was announced, plenty in "Twilight's Kingdom, Part 2". Such as the whereabouts of Scorpan in all of this, what new powers the rainbow elements entail and how Ponyville will now function as a kingdom, not to mention how Discord's completed reform will be displayed.
    -   The villain of the Season 5 premiere, Starlight Glimmer, escapes at the end of her story and is seen a couple of times in the background throughout the season.
    -   Cozy Glow, the villain of the Season 8 finale, is imprisoned in Tartarus next to Tirek, and asks him if he wants to be friends with her complete with a Slasher Smile and omnious music, suggesting she wants to break out with him.
    -   At the end of the final season opener, King Sombra is Killed Off for Real, but the heroes are unaware of the presence of Grogar, who has formed a Legion of Doom with three of their past enemies: Chrysalis, Tirek and Cozy.
-   While Wakko and Dot were able to save Yakko from getting killed in the episode "Fear and Laughter in Burbank" from the 2020 reboot of "Animaniacs", they were unaware of Yakko's fear, even though Yakko asks his siblings what they thought of him. Yakko's fear is likely to be brought up again in Season 2 where Yakko, Wakko, and Dot go deeper into their own fears.
-   _Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja_: The end of "Randy Cunningham: 13th Century Ninja" suggests Catfish Booray will become a regular antagonist in later episodes.
-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_ ended with Mina being defeated but she's still alive and claims she'll come back someday and that her ideals will never die anyway. The final scene also has Earth and Mewni being merged (and possibly other dimensions) and it looks like it's going to take awhile for their citizens to get used to it...
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_: "The Zillo Beast Strikes Back" ended with scientist Dr. Boll being given orders from Palpatine to clone the deceased Zillo Beast. Unfortunately, the show's initial Cut Short status ultimately made the series unable to follow up on it.
-   _Star Wars Rebels_: Series finale "Family Reunion — and Farewell" ends with protagonist Ezra Bridger having been lost in hyperspace with antagonist Grand Admiral Thrawn while liberating Ezra's home planet from the Empire. Sabine's closing narration (covering the period of time of _Rogue One_, _A New Hope_, _The Empire Strikes Back_, and _Return of the Jedi_) informs the audience that she and Ahsoka Tano are setting out on a journey to find him.
-   _Taz-Mania_: In one episode, Molly brings a kitty home and the kitty torments Taz behind Molly's back. In the end, the kitty held a sign saying "I'll be back". A later episode did feature the cat returning.
-   At the end of _Teen Titans_ season four, Big Bad Trigon has been defeated and the apocalypse averted, but Robin makes a point of reminding Raven that Slade, who'd been acting as The Dragon, is still alive and on the loose. This is never really followed up on, however as Slade only gets a cameo in the next and final season (though Word of God is that he was supposed to successfully become The Starscream to the new Big Bad, but it was scrapped for time constraints).
-   _Thomas & Friends_:
    -   The episode "Tenders and Turntables" ends with Gordon, James and Henry plotting to go on strike, which sets up "Trouble in the Shed".
    -   "Toby the Tram Engine" ends with Toby receiving a letter from the "stout gentleman" he met, which continues into "Thomas Breaks the Rules" which sets up why he received such.
    -   The Stinger of "Misty Island Rescue" features Diesel 10 spying on the engines at the Search & Rescue Center's grand opening and promises ruin and destruction for them all with an Evil Laugh, setting up the events of "Day of the Diesels".
-   Every season of _Total Drama_ ends this way, with the exception of _World Tour_, _Revenge of the Island_, and _Pahkitew Island_.
-   In the _U.S. Acres_ episode "Orson Goes on Vacation", Orson says he'll be on vacation for a week soon, and he asks Wade to be in charge again, but he refuses, a possible nod to "Temp Trouble", even though he was actually gone for two weeks in that episode, possibly because in a scene we weren't shown, he called them in the middle of his vacation to tell that he was going to have an extra week off. The person "in charge" in that episode is Aloysius Pig.
    -   It's not possible both episodes exist at the same time or connected since there was too many different scenes and mixing an old episode to a newer one doesn't fit Roy and Wade's Character Development of their friendship.
        -   Or maybe it took place in the future. This isn't the only time it's happened-the episode where they imagine it's summer during the winter took place _a year after the episode had aired_, because Wade says his family did something brave every 10 years, and the next time he would do this was in 2004. Said episode aired in 1993.
    -   Speaking of Aloysius Pig, in "Kiddie Korner", we have this little gem:
        
        **Orson Pig** (singing): We'll bring to you, when we're back next time...  
        **Aloysius Pig** (spoken, as he's being hit with pies): HELP! HEEELP!  
        **Orson Pig** (singing): Something more wholesome than a nursery rhyme! <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
        
-   _Wander over Yonder_
    -   The Stinger during the end credits of "The Rider" replays the final shot of the episode before pulling out to show Lord Dominator laughing maniacally, who would go on to be the main threat of the next season.
    -   The Stinger during the end credits of "The End of the Galaxy" has a decrepit space capsule from the planet Earth sitting on a destroyed planetoid, brimming with green energy similar to that of Lord Hater's and accented with the sound of a monkey screeching and evil laughter.
