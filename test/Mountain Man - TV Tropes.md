_"By God, I are a mountain man, and I'll live 'til an arrow or a bullet finds me. And then I'll leave my bones on this great map of the magnificent..."_

A man who makes his living in the wilderness of Canada or the northern US, most often as trapper or hunter. One of the most recognizable characters in The Western, the Mountain Man is always presented as a large man, covered from head to toe in fur and skins, even in seasons and areas where these would not be needed. When they want to get fancy, they'll wear fringes and beaded accessories as well. The whole ensemble is often topped with a coonskin cap.

They also usually sport a very large beard and rather long hair, though if one is the main character he will often have no beard, or a much smaller, scruffier one. Common equipment includes a readily accessible long hunting rifle (often anachronistic, such as a flintlock, muzzle-loaded gun), a "Big Fifty" (a .50 caliber Sharps rifle used for buffalo hunting), and of course a _really_ big knife, either a Bowie knife or an Arkansas toothpick (a type of broad-bladed dagger).

As well, they carried a leather bag (called a "possibles bag") for essential equipment (a bullet mold for lead bullets, lead bullets in a bullet pouch, a gunpowder horn, an awl,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  knives, a tin cup, a buffalo robe or a blanket, pipe and tobacco, flint and steel for starting fires, a small frying pan or pot), a pack, a "medicine bag" for trap bait, and traps. Mountain men also carried beads and silver jewelry for trading with Indigenous people.

On the trail, they ate "appalos", which were meat and fat that were slow-roasted over a fire, jerky and pemmican (ground-up jerky, berries and beef tallow). These methods of cooking and preserving food were also used by Indigenous people. Their beverage of choice on an icy night around a campfire was "Awerdenty", their term for strong whiskey.

When they are the heroes of the piece, they are often employed as scouts, guides or trackers. If the story is set in the late 1800s or later, after the decline of the fur trade, they are more likely to be solitary characters. Mountain men may have a background in the army, which gives them solid marksmanship. Some may have a Dark and Troubled Past and so they keep on the move to stay off the lawman's radar. If the story is set in the early 1800s, when the fur trade was booming, they are more likely to be depicted as part of a group of trappers working for fur companies. When mountain men were trapping and hunting in a group, the leader was called the "Booshway" (this comes from the French word "bourgeois", used by the French voyageurs).

As the heyday of mountain trappers was before that of cattle drives, he may be visibly older than the cowboys and other stock characters. His rifle will often be out-of-date (as previously noted), he may speak in a strange or antiquated way, and he may not be aware of changes in the big cities or the rest of the world.

They are often shown alternating between fighting and hanging out in a friendly way with the local natives, sometimes doing both at the same time with two different tribes. Their other common enemy is the grizzly bear, and they are often shown killing them in hand-to-hand combat. Every summer, mountain men come together for a rendezvous (meeting) to trade and sell furs and goods. On the trail, they sleep in teepees (bought from Indigenous people), improvised lean-to structures, or just out in the open, wrapped in their buffalo hide.

In newer media, they are often portrayed having Indigenous wives. This was quite a common occurrence historically, but for most of the 20th century wasn't shown in media, due to stronger interracial marriage taboos than now.

They are often portrayed as incredibly strong, being The Big Guy of western characters. This is also one of the character types most prone to going native. They live alone in the woods, so they have to set their own broken bones and tend to their own wounds. As such, they often know about natural herbal remedies.

    Comic Books 

-   _Robin (1993)_: Tim Drake comes across an odd long-haired leather-wearing old man in Appalachia who lives off the land and avoids all but the outskirts of civilization while Tim is trying to track a gun smuggler to his source. He quickly learns that "Stephan" gets away with this due to his ill-defined powers that can make the forests into an Extra-Dimensional Shortcut.
-   Wolverine is more The Drifter in most of his appearances in the "present day" of canon, but he grew up in the backwoods of northern Alberta, which isn't literally mountainous but _is_ rugged and inhospitable as anything.
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: Marya is a rugged solitary young woman who lives in the wilderness and is straight-up called a mountain woman. She comes from farther south than most examples as she's from Mexico, and she did, mostly, clean up for her stint as a student at Holliday College, but even then she pretty much refuses to wear shoes if the terrain doesn't require it and mostly keeps her own council and doesn't interact with the other students if she can help it.

    Comic Strips 

-   _The Far Side_:
    -   Parodied with "Seymour Frishberg: Accountant of the Wild Frontier," who totes his briefcase up mountain ridges.
    -   Another strip features a straighter example... and his pet grizzly.
        
        "Raised the ol' girl from a cub, I did. 'Course, we had to get a few things straight between us. She don't try to follow me into town anymore, and I don't try and take her food bowl away 'til she's done."
        

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Across the Wide Missouri_ is about mountain men hunting and trapping in the Rockies, 1829-30. Interestingly, they aren't as solitary as mountain men are usually shown. They operate as an informal "brigade", and they build a fort before scattering in the mountains, a fort that functions as winter quarters and home base. In that sense this trope is mixed with Settling the Frontier.
-   Gabby Johnson in _Blazing Saddles_ who speaks only "Authentic Frontier Gibberish".
-   The eponymous _"Crocodile" Dundee_ is a very similar archetype, albeit in a radically different climate, being an expert tracker and outdoorsman who prefers a solitary lifestyle in the wilderness and obtains most of his income from hunting.
-   Jeremiah from _Grizzly Mountain_ and _Escape From Grizzly Mountain_. In these movies, Jeremiah is actually friendly with a bear — who he called Jack. In the latter, he helps a future boy rescue a bear from his abusive owners.
-   _Inglorious Basterds_ has Aldo Raines claim being a direct descendant of the famous mountain man Jim Bridger as to confirm his credentials for the war party tactics he intends his unit to use against the Nazis.
-   _Jeremiah Johnson_ from the movie of the same name is probably one of the most famous examples of this character, he in turn is based on the real-life John Johnson, or Liver Eatin' Johnson.

-   _The Magnificent Seven (2016)_ features Jack Horne, the big, tough mountain man of the group.
-   The bearded, burly Hill Folk in _Matewan_, who only once come off of the high mountains to chase the Company men away because their cars "make too much noise". When asked how old their rifles are, they respond "from the war...between the states". The movie is set in 1920.
-   The Posthumous Character known only as 'the Mountain Man' in _The Mountie_. Grayling eventually learns that it was what the Mountain Man had discovered on his expeditions into the mountains that got him killed.
-   Leonardo DiCaprio plays legendary mountain man Hugh Glass in _The Revenant_, about how Glass was mauled by a bear, before miraculously recovering and seeking revenge on those who left him for dead.
-   In _The Shadow of Chikara_, the party encounters a trio of mountain men as they make their way into the mountain. However, these three are also Dangerous Deserters who plan to rob and murder them, and rape Drusilla.

-   The Bear Man from _True Grit 2010_. As Cogburn and Ross stand and wait to see who is after them, a giant bear appears to emerge from the drifting snow – except that it is not a bear, but a wild-eyed wanderer, covered by a full bearskin (including the head) and shaggy beard. Far more monstrous in appearance than the ‘Davy Crockett’ type of frontiersman more usually celebrated in oaters, this bestial eccentric is an itinerant dentist, veterinarian and doctor (“for those humans that will sit still for it”) .

-   In _The Simpsons_, the founder and namesake of Springfield was Jedediah Springfield, a mountain man who settled the untamed lands that would become the town and once killed a bear with his bare hands — or at least, that's how history recorded him. In reality, he was little more than a charlatan — and the bear killed _him_.

    Real Life 

-   The "mountain men" proper (that is, fur company-contracted American men who trapped in the West) existed for a little over one generation in the 19th century but had antecedents in the North American colonial period going back several centuries. The voyageur was essentially the same man, but 200 years earlier and Canadian French. They, in turn, descended from the coureurs des bois, who were independent rather than being tied to a particular fur company.
-   One notable real-life example is the enigmatic "Leatherman" (no, not that kind), who toured the northeastern United States in the late 19th century.
-   The Devil's Brigade was the name of a U.S./Canadian joint special forces group during World War II. They recruited men from rural areas that were experienced in hunting and survival skills to fight in the cold harsh mountains of northern Italy.
-   It was common for the first people traveling the Oregon Trail to hire mountain men as guides, but later they were replaced by books and at the migration's peak the wagon ruts were so deep they could be followed across the country. These ruts are still visible in parts of Wyoming.
-   In 1984, a father and son pair of these abducted Olympic biathlete Kari Swenson while she was out for a training run, wanting a wife for the son. She was rescued after a harrowing 18 hours, but not before being shot, caught in the crossfire between her kidnappers and would-be saviors.
-   The kidnapper of Peggy Ann Bradnick has been described as a mountain man, however Bradnick herself objects to this and points out that he knew little about surviving in the wilderness.
-   In recent years some real-life individuals who could be described as modern mountain men have become associated with the sovereign citizen movement and other extreme positions.
-   Non-American examples:
    -   The Gurkhas. The ultimate men from the ultimate mountains.
    -   Italy has the Alpini, raised among the inhabitants of the Alps specifically to defend that border from Austro-Hungarian attacks in case of war. They're considered _the_ mountain troops, and have managed to outfight the Red Army in _winter_ (they had been sent to the Eastern Front in World War II with plans to deploy them in the Caucasus, and in the meantime, they were deployed in the plains. They all happened to be very good skiers, and the Alps in winter are just as cold as Russian plains...).
    -   Austria-Hungary's Landesschützen/Kaiserschützen, originally a territorial militia, later Austria-Hungary counter to the Alpini. They finally fought each other during World War I, with both forces blowing up multiple mountains because it's easier to do that than to straight-out assaulting it, and found each others' Worthy Opponents.
    -   And, of course, Scots. The Scottish Highlands and the Peak District just over the border in Yorkshire are some of the most notoriously unforgiving terrain in Europe, more so than the Alps in some ways thanks to being right on the Atlantic coast.
    -   In Sweden, a mountain man was a person who worked in the mountain iron mines, most famously in Berslagen and Dalarna. They were nearly always armed (since the Swedish Yeomen — much like the English — were required by law to own a certain set of weapons during the middle ages.) and occasionally used said weapons against the King, the Sherriff, or anyone else they felt threatened their interests. Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson is the most famous example of a Swedish mountain man rebel. Sometimes, however, they fought _for_ the king, like in the case of Gustav Vasa and his Dalecarlians (men from Dalarna.) In a similar vein, people who had committed crimes would _always_ receive amnesty if they took up work in a mountain mine (except if they had commited murder or high treason), where they were guarded by "mountain soldiers" who most likely were serving a sentence themselves. Needless to say, they were not nice people.
    -   Fidel Castro and his guerrillas deliberately cultivated this image when fighting the Cuban government forces from their mountain hideouts.
-   The "Button Man" is a real-life hermit living in the vast bush of Wonnangatta Valley, Australia who has been known to stalk unsuspecting hikers. Although a number of high-profile disappearances in Wonnangatta have made the Button Man a minor Urban Legends celebrity, police reportedly interviewed and cleared him of any suspicion.
