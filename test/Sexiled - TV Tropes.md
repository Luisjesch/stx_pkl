The worst part is he doesn't even help pay the rent!

**Adrian Monk:** This is it, old — Uh-oh! Tie on the doorknob! My roommate and I did the same thing, it's a code.  
**Natalie Teeger:** Yeah, I think I might know about that.  
**Adrian Monk:** Yeah. Means, "Don't come in! I'm reorganizing my closet!"  
**Natalie Teeger:** _\[beat\]_ Your _closet_?  
**Adrian Monk:** Yeah. My roommate in freshman year, Greg, he reorganized his closet four or five times a week.  
**Natalie Teeger:** Uh-huh, and did his girlfriend ever come over to help?

— _Monk_, "Mr. Monk and the Class Reunion"

When people have to share a living space funny situations are bound to happen, and when you factor in sex things are bound to get messy, so many roommates have a signal that tells their roommate not to come in when things are hot and heavy. In other words, they've been sexiled, and once this is established we are often treated to the sight of the one being sexiled sitting around waiting to be let back in.

Common visual shorthand usually includes some item being placed on the doorknob or directly outside the door. Common variants include a tie or hair scrunchy, though people may develop their own personal signals that range from the mundane to the outrageous. These basically serve as a substitute for the "Do Not Disturb" sign.

Of course, breaking a sexile is a prime opportunity for hilarity to ensue. If the act is purposefully committed with someone else there, that's Sex in a Shared Room.

Not to be confused with Exiled to the Couch, when someone is kept out of their _own_ bedroom (and by implication, denied sex) or Lysistrata Gambit, which is about withholding sex as leverage in negotiation.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In the first _Revenge of the Nerds_, the two nerds suggest some sort of code as soon as they move into their dorm in what may be an over optimistic move, given their track record so far.
-   Used in the Gary Coleman TV movie _The Kid with the 200 I.Q._, where Gary and his jock roommate agree on such a signal for the jock's benefit, although Gary later uses it to keep the jock out of the room for other reasons.
-   An interesting variation, where there are no actual roommates, forms the whole premise of the film _The Apartment_. Here the protagonist's _work colleagues_ constantly borrow the key of his apartment, so that they can use it for philandering.

Later said brawn takes a lover and, not trusting Simeon, uses a device that makes the two invisible to cameras. A jealous Simeon, fuming that he'd _said_ he would give them privacy when they asked, finds he can still see through her ocular implants and smugly announces that, completely ruining the mood and upsetting the participants. Simeon is chastised even more severely and learns to take the hint and have some manners.
-   In _The Crossing_, the porn girls being run as prostitutes by Ellis and Long put stuffed animals in the window when they're entertaining johns. A pretty dark example, since the girls are basically sex slaves.

So in order to facilitate this, each of the brothers gets to be with her on a cyclic basis for one year. Any brother who breaks this rule is to be exiled. One day, Yuddhisthra and Draupadi begin their year together and "get busy." Arjuna forgot his bow in the bedroom, and walks in on the couple. As per their agreement, he is exiled, and has many (mis)adventures along the way. He also takes a second wife, Subhadra.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The short-lived college comedy _Undeclared_:

-   _House_ plays with this at one point when Wilson, who is currently living with House, sees their signal of a stethoscope on the doorknob and proceeds to sit outside for hours until House lets him back in.

-   In _The Big Bang Theory_, Sheldon tries to decipher what a tie on Leonard's door means, eventually calling on Penny for help.

Played with in that they didn't share the same room; Sheldon just was that uncomfortable being in the same apartment as two people getting it on.
-   Used in an episode of _The Waltons_, of all places. A potted geranium on the porch meant that Ma and Pa were gettin' intimate.
-   Referenced in _The Middleman_ when Tyler ends up wearing his sexile necktie to a job interview.

    -   In another episode, Marshall and Lily have to stay in the bathroom because Ted is about to have sex with his girlfriend and thinks Lily and Marshall are away for the weekend. This is more about them not wanting to ruin Ted's mojo, so they keep hidden until the night moves to the bedroom.
-   Used in _I Dream of Jeannie_, when Roger and Tony are forced to be roommates for a teamwork assessment. They agree on a porchlight as a signal, but Roger leaves it on all night long, forcing Tony to sleep outside. In the morning, an irate Tony confronts him, only for Roger to blithely tell him it was to keep burglars away.
-   Referenced by the First Lady, of all people, in a first season episode of _The West Wing_ (the sock on the doorknob variant).
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_: Done by leaving your boots outside the door to the bunkroom.

-   One death on _1000 Ways to Die_ involved a Jerk Jock who constantly did this to his nerdy roommate. Eventually, however, the roommate meets a girl and finally gets his own chance to score. The jock, however, barges in while they are doing it and gets on his bottom bunk while the nerd tries to keep doing it on the top bunk. To do the math, one couple having sex on the top bunk of a bunk bed + one jackass egging on while laying on the bottom bunk + the title of the show being "1000 Ways to _Die_" = one dead jock.
-   _Young Sheldon_: In "An Expensive Glitch and a Goof-Off Room", Sam can't study on her dorm because her roommate hung a sock on the doorknob to indicate that she's having sex. Sheldon misunderstands and thinks she's grossed out by the sock itself, as he would be.

-   This shows up in one of _The Order of the Stick_ prequel books. Roy has been strung up and lost all his clothing.

He's a bit annoyed to be thrown out of what's actually his own bed for the evening — especially as he's offered at least one other bed for the night that he wants to avoid — but he eventually acquiesces.
