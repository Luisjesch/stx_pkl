They become friends later.

_"Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than your own."_

— **H. Jackson Brown, Jr.**

A bittersweet trope where Alice loves Bob but realizes that a relationship between them cannot happen, so she decides to put Bob's happiness above her own. Accordingly, she abandons her claim to Bob and encourages him to move on and live his own life, even if that means watching (or even supporting) a relationship between Bob and someone else. The trope is intended to show that Alice is noble and selfless, but it can fall flat if the plot hasn't shown that Alice and Bob had any real connection, or if Alice appears to have ulterior motives (i.e. is still trying to get with Bob by pretending she is letting him go).

If _Bob_ is the one who chooses to do this, this act of sacrifice may (paradoxically) be what causes Alice to notice his interest and/or decide she wants to be with him after all, thus rewarding his virtue. But even if she doesn't, Bob may still contribute to her Happily Ever After, usually in the form of an "If You Ever Do Anything to Hurt Her..." speech directed at her new paramour.

Under The Four Loves, this would be classified as _Agape_: seeking the other person's good unconditionally, even if there's nothing else in it for you. Also see Romantic False Lead, Act of True Love, Unrequited Love and Insecure Love Interest. A Mutual Pining scenario often comes from both parties thinking this but failing to identify themselves as the one the other genuinely does want.

Contrast Murder the Hypotenuse, Green-Eyed Monster, Attempted Homewrecker, and Love Makes You Evil. Compare/contrast Loved I Not Honor More. Diametric opposite to If I Can't Have You…. Sister Trope to Prized Possession Giveaway (when a character gives another the material possession they treasure the most, knowing that the other character will be happy by receiving it).

**In extreme cases, this can be paired with a Death Trope. You Have Been Warned.**

-   In _9 Chickweed Lane_, Edie is not happy that her rediscovered-love-turned-fiancé Kiesel is about to "haul off and be honorable" after they both learn that Edie's _other_ love interest, Bill, is in fact alive but didn't contact Edie for ten years, even after he physically recovered from World War II and his amnesia supposedly wore off. Not helping Kiesel's case is the fact that he's an ex-Nazi and Bill was sent to Omaha Beach as punishment for defending Edie's honor against a superior with his fists. It's a foregone conclusion since this is a flashback, and it's implied Edie and Bill's marriage wasn't perfect ("You used dad's name and 'passion' in the same sentence!").

    Fairy Tales 

-   In "Beauty and the Beast", the Beast agrees to let Beauty return home to see her ill father when she begs him to even though he's not exaggerating when he warns her that he'll die of grief if she stays home too long.

She's given an out: if she kills the prince with a magic dagger and lets his blood splash on her legs, she'll turn back into a mermaid and at least regain her natural 300-year lifespan. She can't go through with it, dies, but is granted the opportunity to earn her OWN afterlife because of her sacrifice.
-   In "Sweetheart Roland" by The Brothers Grimm, a shepherd picks a flower who's actually the protagonist. He proposes to her when she becomes human again, but she's still in love with the titular Roland; nevertheless, the shepherd continues to let her live with him until she eventually wins Roland back.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Arthurian Legend:
    -   Modern tellings often have Arthur tolerate the love affair between Guinevere and Lancelot because he loves them both too much to see them suffer. Guinevere refuses to run off with Lancelot despite her love for him because she still loves Arthur too.
    -   Lancelot and Galehaut also get interpreted this way. In the legends, they're friends with a lot of Ho Yay (including Galehaut seeming enamored at first sight). Later, Galehaut helps set up the affair with Guinevere, which to modern readers seems like this trope plus Incompatible Orientation.
-   In Celtic Mythology, Emer and Fand both loved Cu Chulainn so much that they BOTH were willing to give him to the other.
-   _The Bible_: The Judgment of Solomon, where the king hears the case of two women who each claim a baby is hers - he rules that the court should simply cut the kid in two and give half to each woman.

    Theater 

-   The climactic moment of _Der Rosenkavalier_, when the Marschallin gives up her younger lover Octavian to a woman his own age whom he has fallen in love with.
-   _Cyrano de Bergerac_ is about the original Cyrano helping the handsome Christian win the heart of the woman they both love, Roxane. He does this because Roxane is already fond of Christian (who's genuinely a decent guy, just lacking in wit), and Cyrano himself believes he's too ugly to ever have a chance with her. Unfortunately for them both, Roxane does fall in love with Christian, but only because of the words Cyrano gave him to use. She eventually learns the truth, but only after Christian has died in battle, and while Cyrano is dying from a mortal wound, denying it all.
-   _A Very Potter Musical_ lampshades this trope's presence in its source material with repeated references to the _Spider-Man Trilogy_.
-   In _Martin Guerre_, when Arnaud is arrested for impersonating Martin Guerre and sleeping with his wife, a judge decides that Bertrade is still married to Martin, and leaves Arnaud's fate in his former friend's hands.

-   Used in _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_ when Mrs Lovett attempts to justify the lies she has been telling Sweeney. Her excuse is that she convinced him his wife was dead for his own good, because due to Lucy's insane state he could never have been happy with her. It's a chilling example of this trope invoked by a character _on purpose_ to whitewash the machinations of a psychotic Yandere. Unsurprisingly, Sweeney buys into it about as much as the audience do.
-   _Twelfth Night_: Viola loves Orsino, but tries her best to set him up with Olivia, the girl he professes to love, instead.
-   _The Phantom of the Opera_: Most of the movie, the Phantom tries his hardest to keep Christine for himself, but when she kisses him at the end, he has a change of heart and tells her and Raoul to 'Go now and leave me!'
-   _An American in Paris_: All the spares (Milo, Henri, and Adam) accept they aren't "true loves" and instead let their respective love interests find real romance with each other.
-   The stage version of _Les Misérables_ plays this trope completely straight regarding Éponine's love for Marius, unlike the novel and even the musical's film version, where her selflessness is much less consistent. Jean Valjean is also a parental example of this trope for Cosette, as in the novel.
-   _The Misanthrope_ gives you two for one. Philinte wants Éliante to be happy, and Éliante wants Alceste to be happy. Both are equally fine being the runner up to their beloved's preferred suitor.
-   _Hamilton_: Angelica Schuyler's signature song "Satisfied" outlines how she has this platonically for her sister Eliza, for whom she played matchmaker with Alexander Hamilton even though she realized both sisters had fallen for him. Angelica knew that she could have had Alexander for herself because of her wits and status as the elder sister, but swallowed her own feelings in order to allow her sister to marry her love while she ended up in a loveless marriage.
-   In the original _Miss Saigon_, the signature song of Ellen (the woman Chris (the titular character's lover) marries after returning home from the Vietnam War) makes it clear that she intends to fight to keep her husband. But in the revival, it's been changed to indicate that she'll give him up if that's what's needed for him to heal from his trauma.
-   Fernando in _Mariana Pineda_ keeps his promise to help Pedro to hide from authorities even after he learns that Pedro is Mariana's lover, because, by his own admission, he doesn't want to see her suffer.
-   Lancelot in Artus - Excalibur, with both Artus and Guinevere as the beloved.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Case 03: True Cannibal Boy_: Although Lily is in love with Sally, she doesn't object to the latter's relationship with Marty until he starts showing signs of being a Yandere.
-   Shima-kun from _CLANNAD_, who wishes for Misae to find her happiness, since he's worried about her. The Kyou route revolves around deconstructing this trope, showing just how awkward and painful it would be in reality.

-   The ending of _Fate/stay night_'s Fate route and the Anime falls under this trope, with Shirou allowing Saber to destroy the Grail even if it means their separation. In the game's last route, Sakura is shown to be resigned to Shirou and her sister, Rin, getting together, and is surprised at Shirou reciprocating her feelings.
-   In almost all endings to _Frozen Essence_, Zareh helps Mina be with her chosen love interest and bids her farewell in spite of having been in love with Mina for a thousand years and being the one who unsealed her from her prison in the first place. This is the most prominent in Rune's path where he tells Mina that she will never be happy if she doesn't see Rune again, risks being captured and exposed to let Mina reunite with Rune, and tells Mina in the Light End to let go of him and focus on her future with Rune instead. What really makes this sad is that Mina doesn't even realize the full significance of this because she's lost all her memories of her past - and by extension, Zareh - so she doesn't even know who this person comforting her in her dreams is. However, this is subverted in Zareh's own Dark End where he snaps after being rejected by Mina and keeps her captive to prevent her from leaving him.

-   Seven from _Mystic Messenger_ tries to pull this throughout a portion of his route. He spends a good few days ignoring you and speaking to you cruelly in an attempt to push you away because he thinks he's too dangerous to be with and that you would be better off with someone who lives a safer life, and with seemingly good reason; Vanderwood reminds him that agents within their Nebulous Criminal Conspiracy aren't allowed to have any loved ones, lest their relationships become a hindrance on the agent's efficacy, and and that he's heard of agents who defied this rule being forced to witness their loved ones be tortured or killed by the agency.
-   _Katawa Shoujo_, this is the reason why Misha helps Hisao get together with Shizune in the latter's route. The big twist here is that her beloved is not Hisao but Shizune. Eventually, however, especially after the first time Hisao and Shizune have sex, her feelings start to come to the surface and put a strain on _everyone's_ relationships with each other.
-   Torahiko Ooshima in _Morenatsu_ is shown to be this if you don't pick him. He is known by fans as the "Canon" Route of the story. The sad thing is, you can't pick his storyline yet.
-   Every route in _Princess Waltz_ ends with this. in the first half of the game, Chris sacrifices herself for Arata. And in the second half of the game, Arata and whichever partner you choose to fall in love with but that girl ultimately steps out of the way so he can be with Chris after she is saved. Although the True End implies that a different solution was eventually worked out.
-   Rather surprisingly, Saya in _Saya no Uta_ displays this at one point: she reveals to Fuminori that she has the ability to restore his distorted senses back to normal and offers to do so for him. If Fuminori says that he wants it, she willingly does it even though she's visibly saddened by how this will effectively force her to separate from the one human who she could truly connect to forever because his normal human senses wouldn't be able to bear the sight of her true Eldritch Abomination form.
-   Ambrosia and Arsenik do this for each other at various points in _War: 13th Day_. Near the beginning, Ambrosia succumbs to blackmail in order to keep Arsenik out of prison. In one ending, Ambrosia is framed for murder and Arsenik decides to take the blame for it.
-   Happens in backstory of _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_, although the "beloved" party doesn't learn about it until much later. Iris was dating Phoenix for 6 months while pretending to be her sister Dahlia to get a necklace Dahlia gave him earlier, which was a piece of evidence that could put Dahlia in prison. During these 6 months she truly fell in love with him, but Dahlia became impatient and tried to kill him to get it herself. After Dahlia was arrested, Iris disappeared without telling Phoenix the truth, because she felt she caused him enough pain already and he'd be better off without her.
-   In _Majikoi! Love Me Seriously!_, Hideo's maid Azumi does her best to help him with his love for Kazuko. Also happens in Azumi's route, when Yamato helps Azumi confess to Hideo.
-   In _Ikemen Sengoku_, every romance route has a guy who is _not_ that route's love interest develop one-sided feelings for the female main character. Fortunately, in almost all cases, that guy is content to step aside and let the main character be happy together with the man she loves, including even normally manipulative/villainous guys like Mitsuhide and Kennyo.
-   Toma admits in the _Amnesia: Memories_ fandisc _Amnesia LATER_ how far he was willing to go to keep the heroine happy.

-   _Kim Possible_:
    -   In _So The Drama_, Ron Stoppable becomes increasingly jealous of Kim's new crush, Eric, leading him to the realization that he was in love with her, and had been for some time. On the night of the junior prom, he decides to tell Kim how he really feels before realizing that if she did not feel the same way and wanted Eric instead, it could potentially ruin their friendship. Later on, he is visiting Bueno Nacho, apparently having decided not to go through with telling Kim, leaving her to attend the prom with Eric and him feeling sorry for himself. However, whilst there, he uncovers Dr. Drakken's latest scheme, leading to the revelation that Eric is a synthodrone, designed for the sole purpose of luring Kim into a trap and thus giving Ron his chance to confess to Kim. She returns his affections and marks the Relationship Upgrade between the two.
    -   Yori, basically a Japanese version of Kim. She was really keen on Ron, who was oblivious to her affections.

-   _King of the Hill_: Dale's wife Nancy has been having a very obvious affair with John Redcorn for most of the marriage, even bearing a son with him (though Dale is none the wiser).

While Redcorn is not happy at first, Dale helps him reclaim the land that the government took from him and comes to see Dale as a true friend.

-   _The Legend of Korra_: The series has this with Avatar Korra. Korra is often portrayed as stubborn and even a bit selfish. In a heartwarming gesture, she shows that she can be selfless by allowing Mako, who she is in love with, to be with his then-girlfriend Asami Sato. Korra even goes so far as to befriend Asami and tell Mako to go to her when she needs him. Then, in a twist by itself, Mako admits to having strong feelings for Korra as well and knows how much it hurts her to see him with Asami. Finally, Korra and Mako break up because of their conflicting personalities and that they are better as friends, leading to Korra and Asami ending up dating each other at the end of the series. And one of the things that helped them bound was the fact that they both dated the same guy. And to twist it even further, by the series finale, Mako himself may have grown to feel this about Korra and Asami's relationship. The writers have stated that they think Mako will always carry a bit of a torch for Korra, and a fairly popular Alternate Character Interpretation is that Mako telling Korra that he's got her back, and he always will, was him saying that he understood and supported her and Asami's developing relationship. If you subscribe to that interpretation, his last scene in the series becomes this trope.

    -   Hexadecimal does this too in season 4. She is the only one that can stop Daemon's infection from destroying the entire Net but only goes through with it because destroying the Net means destroying Bob. She even tells Dot to take care of Bob right before performing her Heroic Sacrifice.
    
    **Bob:** Hex, you won't survive this. It's a one-way trip. Total fragmentation.

Star _tries_ to invoke this trope, but finds that she has a hard time doing so. Her unintentional jealousy and bottling of her emotions cause her magic to go berserk in a number of episodes throughout that season.
    -   Played straight in Seasons 3 and 4. Shortly after Season 3's "Battle for Mewni" arc, Jackie breaks up with Marco because she knows he's unhappy with life on Earth after spending so much time on Mewni, and implicitly because she knows he'd be happier with Star. Later, when Marco realizes that he has a crush on Star, he holds off on telling her because she had already moved on by that point to start dating Tom, a friend he cares too much about to hurt. Later on, towards the end of Season 4, while Tom doesn't say this to Star when they break up, giving the more vague reason of feeling they're moving in incompatible directions in life, the conversation he has with Marco the following day has Tom all but admit that he's begrudgingly accepted that she'll be happier with him.
-   _Teen Titans (2003)_:
    -   In the episode "Things Change", Beast Boy encounters an unnamed schoolgirl bearing a striking resemblance to his once-petrified girlfriend Terra. Eager to resume their relationship, he is met with considerable resistance on her part, as she repeatedly explains to Beast Boy that she does not wish to be associated with Terra, or Terra's bad deeds. Ultimately, Beast Boy realizes the strain he's putting her through when she explains that, though he may enjoy being a Titan, _she_ just wants to be normal, and he leaves her to enjoy a normal life while he goes off to assist his team with a new threat.
    -   A variant happens in the _Teen Titans Go!_ continuation comics, when Terra's brother Geoforce shows up looking for her. Beast Boy tells him about the schoolgirl, and he confirms when they visit the school that she is indeed Terra; but when he sees that she's happier now than she's ever been, they leave without speaking to her. However, Terra does notice her brother out of the corner of her eye and seems happy that he checked up on her.
-   _Thunder Cats 2011_: Lion-O finds out that his crush Cheetarah prefers his older brother Tygra over him and has been ever since they first met as children. While he does go on to encourage their relationship in front of their friends, he does take Cheetarah aside in private to call her out for her flirtatious methods of supporting and encouraging him, which led to the misunderstanding in the first place. He _does_ want them both to be happy, especially since he and his brother are _finally_ starting to get on good terms for the first time in their entire lives, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's happy _about_ it.
-   _Total Drama_:
    -   Cody. He liked Gwen but didn't know that Gwen was clearly the Official Couple with his friend Trent. Once he figured it out, though, he decided to help set them up together. This is averted in Season 3. By this point, Gwen and Trent have broken up, and Cody makes it clear that he's hoping she'll give him another chance. However, he's once again oblivious to the fact that she likes somebody else — Duncan, a friend of hers who's Troubled, but Cute at best and a Jerkass at worst, and himself is already involved with someone else. When the two secretly kiss in the bathroom and later get found out, Cody's reaction is to punch Duncan in the face and continue flirting with Gwen.
    -   In _Pahkitew Island,_ Ella gets her heart broken when she finds out that Dave likes Sky instead of her. When Sky asks her what's wrong Ella tells her about Dave's feelings without any hint of bitterness.
-   _The Venture Brothers_: Mocked at the very end of Season 4. When The Outrider tells Dean "you should be happy as long as she's happy", he curses him back with a Precision F-Strike.
-   In the _Winnie-the-Pooh_ Valentine's Day Episode _Winnie The Pooh: A Valentine For You_, Pooh prepares to give Christopher Robin the Smitten which could bite him and remove his potential lovesickness, but upon seeing how happy he is to have his new friend, he ultimately decides against it.
