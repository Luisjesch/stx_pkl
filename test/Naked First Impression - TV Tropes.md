Protip: A girl should know your name _before_ your "size".

Someone enters an obscured area, sometimes in a hurry, and catches a stranger with their pants down, undressed or in the bath/shower.

Reactions will differ. They may chase them down and beat the tar out of them. An Innocent Fanservice Girl will be oblivious to the reaction she's getting, a Shameless Fanservice Girl won't give a damn, and a Reluctant Fanservice Girl will be mortified. Others may acknowledge that it's all an awkward accident. Still others might actively _flaunt_ their assets. Whatever the reaction, the guy/girl may be asked to Please Put Some Clothes On.

For even more reaction, the naked character may Open the Door and See All the People.

Compare Accidental Pervert and Outdoor Bath Peeping. If Played for Laughs, it's because Naked People Are Funny. Can overlap with Naked on Arrival.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Absolute Boyfriend_ has Night be delivered naked and this is how Riiko sees him, of course. And she _looked_.
-   _Akikan!_: After Melon appears for the first time, she sees Kakeru, who's just gotten out of the shower. Kakeru is ecstatic that there's a girl in his room for the first time ever, but she magically propels him into the wall. It takes a good few minutes before he's actually wearing something.
-   Fanzell Kruger of _Black Clover_ first met two different characters while in the nude; Asta after losing his clothes in the woods and Noelle Silva after answering the door right after stepping out of the bath.
-   In _Bleach_, when Yoruichi first reveals her human form to Ichigo, she's completely naked. Of course, being a Shameless Fanservice Girl, she remains completely calm about it all, and teases _him_ about his panic and embarrassment. His shrieking actually caused his wounds to reopen. A little bit later, Yoruichi repeats this performance, purely to mess with Ichigo.
-   In _A Bridge to the Starry Skies_, Kazuma takes a bath in the first episode, and walks into the men's side of the bathhouse when he spots Tsumugi cleaning it. He tries to leave immediately, but trips in the process, and Senka, the owner of the Yorozuyo inn, opens the door after hearing him scream, and gets a good look at his naked body as well. In the next scene Kazuma sulks and cries privately, claiming he can't be married now.
-   November 11 in _Darker than Black_ does this to Mao after both being taking to meet Amber. Mao is appropriately freaked out as November 11 sits in a chair with a smile on his face. Played with, though, in that Mao is _a cat_.
-   _DARLING in the FRANXX_: Hiro first encounters Zero Two Skinny Dipping in the Birdcage's fishpond—he rushes in to rescue her, thinking she's drowning, only for her to breach the water right in front of him like a dolphin, with a fish caught in her teeth. She doesn't care overmuch, other than clearly being amused that he's embarrassed about seeing her naked.
-   _Eden of the East:_ The Amnesiac Hero who shortly becomes known as "Akira" finds himself naked in front of the White House, holding nothing but a gun and a cell phone, when he meets heroine and soon-to-be-Love Interest Saki. Oddly, the show never really explains why he's there, let alone without clothes.
-   In _Elfen Lied_, Kouta and Yuka find Nyuu naked on a beach. For Yuka, this is her first time meeting Nyuu. For Kouta, this seems to be the first time and does not remember the Forgotten First Meeting he previously had with Nyuu (or rather, Lucy) during his childhood.
-   In the spinoff manga "Eureka Seven: Gravity Boys and Lifting Girl", the main character Sumner witnesses a lifting competition, a sport in universe which is dominated by men and boys. Seeing the best boarder out there perform beyond expectations, Sumner rushes to the locker room to meet said lifter, only to catch a side view of a woman undressing from the clothes. She is notably pissed and the character turns out to be Ruri, the heroine, who cross-dresses in order to get into lifting competitions.
-   _Fairy Tail_: When Lucy is first introduced to the Fairy Tail guild, Gray is already in his underwear, as is usual for him. This already shocks Lucy enough, but to top it off in the ensuing brawl, Natsu steals Gray's boxer shorts. So it's a stark-naked Gray who asks Lucy if she couldn't _lend him her panties_, making her scream.
-   _The Fruit of Evolution_: Technically played straight with Saria and Rurune, since Seiichi first meets them as a gorilla and a donkey respectively. This obviously isn't a problem, but since Shapeshifting Excludes Clothing is in play, both are stark naked when they turn into beautiful human girls.
-   In _Fruits Basket_, Tohru first encounters Isuzu in animal form, and when she reverts to human, she's naked. Due to Isuzu being exceptionally pretty (Tohru thought she has a supermodel body), it troubles Tohru even more than with boys. Tohru has seen most of the cursed Sohma members being naked, anyway.
-   When Kaname first meets Tessa in _Full Metal Panic!_, she's just stepped out of Sousuke's shower, wearing only a towel. This causes Kaname to think that Sousuke's been skipping out on their study sessions to make out with his girlfriend (a mistake Tessa is happy to leave uncorrected, until things get serious anyway).
-   _Genesis Climber MOSPEADA_:
    -   Aisha is first encountered naked.
    -   Solzie's first encounter with Yellow also happens this way.
-   _Girls Bravo_:
    -   Yukinari meets Miharu for the first time in her giant bathroom (of course being a bathroom she is naked). Played for laughs when he subsequently faints on her bosom.
    -   He is almost as naked as her, but Subverted because is revealed she often sees him through the water whenever he takes a bath. Yeah, whenever.
    -   Just because that first occurrence may not count, the next day Yukinari finds a naked Miharu sleeping in his bed.
    -   Played straight later in the series. Fukuyama is wrongly transported in the same bathtub of Miharu's house, when her sister Maharu is taking a bath (of course being a bathroom she is naked too), thus he make her acquaintance while she is not amused.

-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: JoJolion_: Yasuho first meets Josuke half buried in the ground, trapped and disoriented.

-   In most of Ken Akamatsu's manga, the male lead first meets his future girlfriend naked:
    -   At the start of _A.I. Love You_, Hitoshi's virtual girlfriend Saati becomes real and comes out of his computer. Since he haven't made clothes for her yet, she appears naked before him.
    -   The first meeting of Keitaro and Naru from _Love Hina_ happens at the Hinata House's hot springs because Keitaro went to take a bath without knowing the inn had been turned into a female-only dormitory. Made even more awkward due to Naru's eyesight being so bad that she can't tell there's a man at the bath with her until she touches him down there. Subverted in that Keitaro and Naru had really met when they were small children and forgot about it when they grew up.
    -   In _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, it's averted with Negi and any of his potential love interests. Although, it does happen to Negi's rival Kotaro, a half-dog demon, when he's found as a puppy by two of Negi's students and turns back to human form naked in front of them. Unsurprisingly, one of those girls becomes Kotaro's love interest later on.

-   In _Macross Frontier_, Ranka first meets Alto while he's in the middle of changing into a Latex Space Suit for a stunt show.

-   In _Midori Days_, when Midori first appears on Seiji's hand, she pops out of his sleeve and reveals everything, just about paralyzing him in shock. After Midori hastily covers up, Seiji slips out, "WHY DOES MY HAND HAVE BREASTS!?"
-   Lucoa's first interaction with Shouta in _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_ was her popping out of his cauldron completely naked when he performed a summoning spell. Given the fact that she was clothed when she entered her portal, this means she was naked _deliberately_.
-   Considering the nature of _Miss Machiko_, it's not surprising that this has happened to her more than once. One time, she was in the shower and a visiting tribal leader caught a glimpse of her and had to be physically removed. Another time, a man mistakenly entered her home and caught her in the tub.
-   _My Dress-Up Darling_: Sajuna "Juju" Inui visits the Gojo doll store during a rainy day. Gojo's grandfather let her in so she could use their shower to avoid catching a cold. When Gojo returns and his grandpa tells him that "a friend came to visit him", he panics thinking his grandpa may have let in a dangerous stranger in their home and rushes to the bathroom, to find a naked Sajuna with only a towel draped over her head. Cue Naked Freak-Out.
-   In _One Piece_, Luffy meets Boa Hancock when he accidentally falls on her bath. However, she was more angry that he saw the tattoo on her back marking her as a former slave than that he saw her naked.
-   Melfina is first encountered naked inside a box by Gene and Jim in _Outlaw Star_.
-   Happens to Ranma and Akane in the first episode of _Ranma ½_, with Akane first seeing Ranma's male form when she walks in on him at the bath. Both manga and anime make a point of showing how Akane looks _down_ to make sure that, yep, Ranma's a boy. Later in the same day, when girl-Ranma walks in on her, the anime repeats the joke by having Akane look down at Ranma's breasts — which incenses her _further_, because it just confirms what Ranma said moments earlier about being "better built". At least Akane is holding a towel to preserve some degree of modesty, but now she knows exactly what _both_ sides of Ranma look like naked.
-   In _Rising × Rydeen_, Takara's first meeting with Ruri is him accidentally walking in on her changing clothes in her dressing room after her concert. At first it looks like she's going to hurt him since she screams and grabs his arm before he tries to flee but it turns out she was just excited to see him
-   _Samurai Flamenco_ has a rare male-male example. Beat cop Goto first met wannabe superhero Masayoshi when the latter was buck-naked in an alleyway (his suit had been ripped).
-   _Sekirei_: Minato met Matsu when he was taking a bath in the Izumo Inn, and Matsu walked in wearing only a Modesty Towel (that very quickly falls off as she tries to seduce him).
-   _Shuukan Shounen Hachi_ has a variation: Hachi and Handa technically already know each other, but the first time Hachi actually sees her face<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is when Ran opens the bathroom door of their shared apartment while Handa is in the middle of changing.
-   Soul Eater first meets Hot Witch Cat Girl Blair while the latter is taking a bath.
-   In _Stella Women’s Academy, High School Division Class C³_, the first time Yura (and the audience) meet Sonora, she's just come out of the shower and is wearing nothing but a towel. The scene is then practically repeated in a later episode.
-   _Tenjho Tenge_ has a relationship like this when the hero is sent flying through the air to land on a girl as she was exiting the bath. Despite the fact that he literally crashed through the roof, she takes this as a sign that they are married...
-   _This Ugly Yet Beautiful World_ takes this trope literally. Hikari is completely naked upon meeting Takeru.
    -   Also, while it's slightly different since they already know each other, the first time the viewers see Takeru's cousin Mari, she is in the process of putting on her bra.
-   In _Tokkô_, Ranmaru meets Sakura in bad dreams prior to meeting her in person. She's topless in the dreams for some reason.
-   _To Love Ru_ does this with Lala and Rito's first meeting, when she appears naked in front of him while he's taking a bath in an explosion of water. The scene is made even funnier when he realizes that there's now a naked girl standing in front of him when he notices he's holding something soft and squishy.
-   In _Trinity Seven_, Arata goes to take a bath and meets the stark naked Arin who is there because she thought it was alright to use the school's male bathroom when there was no people in it. Hilariously, Arin being such an Emotionless Girl and not even trying to cover herself makes the scene even more awkward for Arata.
-   Lampshaded/parodied in the first episode of _UFO Baby_. Miyu worries constantly that she's going to be in this situation somehow. Guess what happens. Kanata saw Miyu while she was bathing.
-   In _Umi no Misaki,_ Nagi first sees Karin through the window while she's changing with the curtains open. She's just a bit too used to having an empty house in front of her, as Rinne points out.
-   In episode 1 of _Unlimited Fafnir_, this is how Yuu first meets Iris on the beach. She later tells him her swimsuit fell off while she was swimming in the ocean, hence why she was naked at the time.
-   This is how Victor first introduces himself to Yuri in _Yuri!!! on Ice_: stark naked in Yuri's parents' hot springs. Quite an impression, especially since Yuri idolized Victor. It later turns out it _wasn't_ their first time meeting, but Yuri had been too drunk to remember their first meeting.
-   _Yuria 100 Shiki_: Shunsuke first meets Yuria in an alley wearing nothing but an overcoat ... and about to be taken advantage of by a stray dog.
-   In _Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs_, Kogarashi first meets the Cute Ghost Girl Yuuna when they're both naked since Yuuna had joined him at the hot springs without knowing he could see her.
-   _Zatch Bell!_ has another male-male example. The first time Kyo meets Zatch was after he said something nasty to his mother, which Zatch, who was flying just outside his window when he does, immediately admonishes Kyo for it... and he was naked because he was fishing. It was a rather bad surprise because the first thing Kyo sees when he turns around is _Zatch's privates_. In the American release, this was censored to have Zatch be in his underwear.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Artesia_, Queen Artesia of Dara Dess meets the Duchess Ilyana of Har Misal in the nude. While having sex with both of her sons, her nephew, and another nobleman. Artesia is unruffled - the Duchess is able to keep a straight face due to her upbringing.
-   In _Crimson_, Alex first meeting with Scarlet ends up like this, when a misunterstading causes her to fight him while wearing only a Modesty Towel that he ends up accidentally snatching off of her.

-   In _Les Légendaires: Origine_, Danael first met Jadina when she was bathing in a lake, having fallen due to his ride's stupidity. Jadina was less than understanding and reacted by _shooting a magic blast at him_. Amusingly enough, despite this violent first impression, they had one of the least violent relationships in the main series.
-   Lucky Luke's first encounter with Calamity Jane is a rare case with the male being the naked one; Luke had stopped to take a bath in a lake, and as a result was caught unarmed by hostile Native Americans, only for Jane to show up and rescue him. Surprisingly enough, while he was definitely and understandably embarrassed, she cared very little for the fact he was naked, as she was too busy laughing over the situation.

-   Jon, a.k.a. Skeleton Man, was introduced to Tarot's mother this way in _Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose_. Except that he was the naked one, not her. Not that he didn't see Tarot's mother naked later on, but that's what _Tarot_ is all about.
-   In the _U.S. War Machine_, a Marvel MAX version of War Machine from Iron Man. Jim Rhodes, the commander of the titular special operations unit, walks into a locker room looking for "Josephs," one of his new team members. It turns out Josephs' first name is Sheva and is an attractive and very well-endowed blonde. She is completely nude when Jim walks in, and she tells him to "close the door." He stares at her, wide eyed and complies. She then glares at him and says, "From the outside!"

-   _DC Nation_: Hades forces the Titans to compete in the nude, then sent a zombie horde after he proved a sore loser. Fauna hid among the spectators, but her clothing came off when she changed shape and joined the battle. When they'd beaten back their attackers, they introduced themselves to one another, still not wearing a stitch. They started dating as soon as they got back to San Francisco.
-   _Doctor Who Regenerated_: From his point of view (it's timey-wimey), the Doctor makes a(n almost) Naked First Impression on Daisy, who's met him dressed earlier that say and is rather confused.
-   _Hogwarts Exposed_: Happens a lot, with the twist that the characters who are naked are nudists and not at all embarrassed to be seen like that — but the other side usually is.
-   _How Friendship Accidentally Saved Magical Britain_: Unlike canon, where he was dressed in the Hogwarts uniform and Prefect badge he was presumably wearing at the time of the Horcrux's creation, Tom Riddle emerges from the Diary in this fic buck naked, shivering in the Scottish nighttime chill and just as shocked to suddenly have a body again as the Weasley twins are to see their kind-of buddy in the flesh. Eventually, after gaping at the Weasley-esque freckles all over his body and having a debate with his brother as to whether Tom is sane and if it would even be practical to ask him at all, George chucks his outer robe at Tom's head. Tom manages to find a whole wardrobe of decently fitting discarded clothes in the Room of Hidden Things.
-   Downplayed and Defied in _Four Armed Bride_. Looma models some Lingerie for Ben at his house. Then his mom comes home and Ben points out how bad a first impression Looma would make if she was seen like that.
-   _Jericho (MLP)_: Exaggerated and justified. Jericho meets every Equestrian as they are naked. The thing is, Equestrians don't usually wear clothes, but Jericho is from a nation where ponies do wear clothing. Hilarity Ensues. His first reaction into walking into a tavern and seeing everypony naked? "This is a whorehouse!" Then, in a monologue: "Does this mean that the Princesses will also be naked? Oh, Father above, that's gonna be fun. Why, hello there, so-called deities of sun and moon. No, I swear I wasn't leering creepily at your haunches. I can't even say I know what 'leering' means. Is it a type of frog?"
-   _Loki: Agent of Doomgard_: The Loki of Metropolis 51 is introduced by her answering the door in nothing but lingerie. What follows is a realization by the main character (who is also a Loki, this is an Alternate Self fic) about A Party, Also Known as an Orgy and that this woman is Love Goddess. By the way this is the chapter with the most modesty cutaways in the entire fic.
-   _Neither a Bird nor a Plane, it's Deku!_: Mirio Togata arrives in class completely naked while jumping through the wall. He acknowledges this and apologizes to All Might for making him see "Little Mirio". All Might is then horrified at the realization that Mirio is the most ideal person to inherit One For All.

-   _Wyvern_: Amy barges into Vicky's room, since they're sisters and they do that to each other all the time. Vicky is in said room with Taylor, experimenting with her transformation. Taylor is naked, since a) said transformation inevitably destroys clothing and b) the stress of being naked with someone she just met might help with the transformation. Thus, Amy's first meeting with Taylor involves Taylor's naked butt in the middle of her sister's room. Hilarity Ensues.

-   In _Doc Hollywood_, Julie Warner's character is first seen by Michael J. Fox when she emerges from a lake where she's been Skinny Dipping. When Michael's character says it's alright since he's a doctor, she retorts "then it's nothing you haven't seen before."

-   In _Hacksaw Ridge,_ Andrew Garfield's character meets fellow recruits at an Army Training Camp. One of them, Milt "Hollywood" Zane is showing off his impressive physique by exercising in front of everyone totally naked. It's pure fanservice, and he certainly gets his comeuppance.
-   In _A Knight's Tale_ William and his friends first meet Geoffrey Chaucer while he's roaming the road completely naked after gambling away all his possessions.
-   In _Maleficent_, Diaval is technically first seen "clothed" as he's a raven, but he is naked when Maleficent changes him into a man. Being a fairy, she is completely unfazed by his nudity, while he is mainly preoccupied with the fact that he considers his new human body ugly. While kids might see it as Naked People Are Funny, adults in the room definitely see a bit of Fanservice.

-   In _Moon Zero Two,_ Clementine Taplin meets Bill Kemp this way.

    Literature 

-   In Michael Chabon's _The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay_, the protagonist, Joe Kavalier, first meets his love interest, Rosa Luxemburg Saks, when he has to get into his friend's locked apartment by swinging up the fire escape, and ends up walking in on her napping on the couch completely naked. Soon after, his friend pays him ten dollars to draw her naked from memory (the fact that he remembers her vividly enough to do a realistic sketch is a pretty good clue that he'll end up falling for her).
-   Combined with Fully-Clothed Nudity in _A Brother's Price_. Jerin is absolutely _mortified_ to be in nothing but a thin nightshirt when he meets the Princess Ren, who's in something similar. She is intrigued.

-   A variation of this occurs in _Fight Club_. The unnamed Narrator first meets Tyler when the latter is naked on the beach making a giant hand. The variation, of course is the Narrator and Tyler are the same person, so their meeting was just a delusion.
-   In _Fire & Blood_, after Argilac Durrandon, last of the Storm Kings, is killed in battle with Orys Bartheon during Aegon's conquest, Argilac's daughter Argella refuses to surrender and declares Storm's End will fight to the death. Her soldiers, having heard what happened to Harrenhal and knowing the dragon Meraxes is with Orys's army, promptly turn on Argella, raise a flag of surrender and hand her over to Orys bound, gagged and naked. Ironically, Orys treats her better than her own men; instead of having his way with Argella, he unties her, gives her clothing, food and praises her late father as a Worthy Opponent. Orys's kindness goes a long way towards convincing Argella to marry him to unify the Stormlands under the rule of the Targaryens.

-   Garth Nix's _Old Kingdom_ series:

She instantly calls for her guards, but fortunately, he's able to offer a hurried explanation before she has him dragged out and... dealt with.
-   The _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ novel _Imzadi_ tells how Riker and Troi first met - at a Betazoid wedding, where everyone was naked (including Riker). Troi was the maid of honor and for Riker, it was lust at first sight!
-   A romantic version of this trope occurs between the lovers in _The Legend of Hayaoh_, the story-within-a-story in _Tasakeru_.
-   _The Sunne in Splendour_: When Edward IV drops in to see his Best Friend Will Hastings, he is amused to discover Will's mistress, Jane Shore, naked in the bathtub.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ episode "Ghost" Fitz first meets Robot Girl Aida after she wanders out of Radcliffe's lab before he's had a chance to put some clothes on her.
-   This is how we meet the eponymous _Andromeda_ in her android form. That, and kicking some serious ass.
-   On _The Bill_, Luke Ashton is splashed with mud on his first day back at Sun Hill and decides to sneak in a quick shower before reporting to his new superior officer. Said officer DS Craig Gilmore loses patience with Luke's tardiness and comes looking for him. This is the beginning of their Will They Or Won't They situation.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "Blink": Larry Nightingale's introduction to Sally Sparrow. (He's drunk, which might be an excuse for his inadvertent pantslessness. And he barely remembers it the next day.)
    -   "The Lodger": One character first meets the Doctor when he's just gotten out of the shower and is wearing nothing but a towel. What with Eleven being pure Mr. Fanservice, it's played for as much Fanservice (and hilarity) as possible.
    -   Then in "Time of the Doctor", this is how he meets Clara's family at Christmas. The Doctor had hologram clothes, that could only be seen by Clara (and the audience) as he hadn't calibrated them so that everyone could see them. It then reaches the point where she has to quickly come up with a viable explanation (As they probably wouldn't have believed the truth about him being a 900 year old alien).
        
        **Doctor** Hello, the Oswalds. Hello! Merry Christmas. Hello, hello.  
        (Handshakes for Linda and Dad, air kisses for Gran, who is the only one to look directly at him.)  
        **Doctor** Hello, handsome. Anyone for Twister?  
        **Clara** So, this is the Doctor. My boyfriend. Isn't anyone going to say hello?  
        **Gran** Hello.  
        (Her glass is empty again.)  
        **Doctor** Excuse me a moment. Listen, I've got an idea to break the ice. Why don't I project my clothes hologram onto their visual cortexes too?  
        **Clara** So, to be clear, no one except me can see your clothes?  
        **Doctor** Yes, and I'm starting to think it may be causing tension.  
        **Gran** Are we playing Twister now?  
        **Clara** Get in the kitchen.  
        **Doctor** Eh? Sorry.  
        **Clara** Sorry. He's Swedish.
        
-   Used in a flashback episode of _Everybody Loves Raymond_ before the main couple got married. After delivering her futon and (mercilessly) finally asking Debra out, Ray leaves her apartment now believing himself to have left the greatest impression, and being 'The Man'. He re-enters to drop something off, only to barge in on her naked, getting ready for a shower. The rest of the episode involves him worrying about this to his brother, believing himself now to be the Accidental Pervert.
    
    **Debra:** Why did you open the door?  
    **Ray:** You said come in—  
    **Debra:** I said _coming_!  
    **Ray:** Well it sounded a lot like _come in_!
    
-   On the makeup game show _Face/Off_, all body-painting competitions begin with the contestants meeting the nude models they'll be working with. The models always walk on-stage in the buff to begin with, although they put on robes for the interlude when the contestants are deciding how to paint them.
-   This is River's introduction to the audience and the crew in _Firefly_. Also the screaming and the craziness. No one really makes a huge deal of this, probably because of all the screaming and craziness. And River isn't a love interest for anyone else on the show, so that common factor is also averted. Also, Mal's first assumption is that Simon's transporting River as a sex slave, so he's more pissed off than anything.

-   There is a character in _Gilmore Girls_ which Rory meets at college that is known only as Naked Guy for a few episodes after she finds him naked in the hallway following a party. Later there are some romantic episodes between them. Naked Guy's name was Marty.
-   There's an episode of _Malcolm in the Middle_ where Lois answers the door naked to somebody who turns out to be Malcolm's schoolteacher.
-   Not the _first_ impression, but pretty close. In the first season of _McLeod's Daughters_, Nick walks into the bathroom while Tess is dressing. She covers herself with a Modesty Towel, but doesn't realise until he leaves that he could see her rear in the mirror.
-   On the survival show _Naked and Afraid_ (which is Exactly What It Says on the Tin) the male and female teammates always strip bare before they meet one another for the first time.
-   The dating show _Naked Attraction_ tries to set up couples by giving them a naked first impression. The main contestant has to pick from several possible dates, who are all naked. They're revealed from the bottom-up, so the contestant has to eliminate one person based solely on their lower half, and another on their entire body except their face.
-   Happens in _Seacht_ with Linda and Joanne, Joanne in a towel and Linda being a Lipstick Lesbian. Oh, and they end up sharing a room.
-   In the _The Shannara Chronicles_, Allanon first meets Wil when he finds him passed out naked in a bathtub after being drugged and robbed by Eretria. Later Wil walks in on Amberle while she's taking a Waterfall Shower.
-   In _Sherlock_, Irene Adler does this _deliberately_ when meeting Sherlock and John for the first time. It throws off John completely, but more importantly, it flummoxes Sherlock's scan by giving him nothing to read. Though he still notices her measurements and deduces that this is the combination to her safe.
    -   You'd think the mere fact she was naked would've told him a couple of things -like that she was aware of his methods and had something to hide from him- but it also screws up his Sherlock Scan for more mundane reasons; Sherlock isn't quite as Married to the Job as he likes to think he is.
-   _Smallville_
    -   "Covenant": The fake Kara meets Clark while she's naked at his doorstep.
    -   Clark Kent is naked when he meets Lois Lane in "Crusade", having been reborn as Ka-El and having no concept of modesty. Lois would tease him about it in later episodes.
    -   In "Patriot" Lois _also_ gets to meet Mera this way, walking on her climbing out of a pool Mera decides to change out her swimsuit right in front of Lois, completely unashamed.
-   _Taken_: In "Charlie and Lisa", the title characters Charlie Keys and Lisa Clarke first meet when the aliens coerce them into having sex with each other aboard one of their ships.
-   This is how Fez met Donna in _That '70s Show_. More exactly, he and Hyde went into her room when she was changing her shirt and accidentally flashed them.
    
    **Fez:** _\[to Donna, in another episode\]_ How about the time I met you? _Completely_?
    

    Myths & Religion 

-   Anyone wondering whether this is Older Than They Think need only think of the fate of Actaeon after he interrupted Artemis while she was bathing (she wasn't so harsh on Siproites). Or Tiresias, when he caught Athena bathing, though he only lost his eyesight. These particular Greek myths are Older Than Feudalism.
-   In _The Odyssey_, Odysseus wakes up on a beach completely naked. He hears Nausicaä and her handmaidens bathing and actually alludes to the above story, begging "Artemis" not to smite him. While the handmaids are understandably freaked out by the situation, Nausicaä provides him with clothes.
-   David seeing Bathsheba bathing in The Bible. (Media frequently portray Bathsheba as trying to catch David's eye. However, this is not supported in the text.) David compounded his sins with the Uriah Gambit. God's punishment was their baby's death.

    Roleplay 

-   In _Survival of the Fittest_, Marie Zaid walks in on a showering Adam Dodd. It's... awkward.

    Video Games 

-   In _Breath of Fire III_, Ryu first meets Deis when the magic pyramid seal on her is released and she's stark naked. Ryu turns beet red and looks away, but she ends up standing _right in front of him_ to talk to him, and is completely oblivious to his discomfort. Later, it's made rather obvious that he developed a little crush on her because of that.
    -   Gender-reversed in _Breath of Fire IV_. When Ryu first appears, he's completely nude, and Nina is right in front of him. Fortunately, a merchant who had fled from the monster that preceded Ryu's appearance left some clothes in a chest, which Nina quickly asks him to wear.
-   In _Dm C Devil May Cry_, Kat first meets Dante when she knocks on his trailer door and he answers it naked (having just woken up and not bothering to get dressed). Neither them nor the other people walking in the background show much reaction to his nudity.
-   _Earnest Evans_: Earnest first finds Annet naked on a sacrificial altar, before rescuing her (and giving her his jacket) ... but only in the Japanese Sega CD version, as the American Genesis version was missing all of the cutscenes.
-   Played for drama in _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_ regarding Dorothea and Ferdinand. Years before the start of the game, Dorothea was bathing in a fountain singing to herself after being lifted from her life on the streets when Ferdinand came upon her, staring at her before running off. This led Dorothea to believe he was disgusted by the sight of her and developing a hatred of him when they meet again at the Officers Academy when he treats her kindly, comparing him to a bee after a flower now it has bloomed. In their A support, Ferdinand is shocked to find out that the girl he saw and Dorothea are one in the same and explains he ran because he was both entranced and embarassed. In _Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes_ it's played more for laughs when she overhears Ferdinand describing the situation to Edelgard from his perspective, being that he saw what he believed was a naked water nymph, and realises to her embarassment that his reaction wasn't due to disgust but because of her nudity.
-   The Exile's introduction to Atton Rand in _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_ is him/her walking into Atton's cell in his/her underwear. Atton will continue to rag on the Exile about this until he/she finds some decent clothes.
-   Near the start of _Lunar: Eternal Blue_ Lucia arrives in the Blue Spire several seconds before her clothes materialize, rather surprising Hiro. She's an Emotionless Girl too fixated on her mission to care.
    -   It's revisited _twice_ in the same game. The first time is an inversion of the trope, with Lucia walking in on the game's protagonist Hiro in a public bath. Since she lacks social skills, she doesn't see the harm in bathing on the men's side of the bath and just wants to be with her friends. Hiro's Non-Human Sidekick Ruby prevents him from seeing any naughty bits initially by blocking his view, then by clawing his face to a bloody mess. The second instance has Hiro walking in on Lucia bathing alone, but by this point in the adventure, she has actually become human enough to be genuinely (and very loudly) embarrassed about the whole thing.
        -   Oddly enough, Hiro drops in (literally, as it turns out) on Lucia once more in the game (and, surprise surprise, no clothes present) at the very end of the game in her sanctuary on the Blue Star. This time, she doesn't seem to mind and is, in fact, overjoyed to see him.
-   At the beginning of _Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga_, Toad finds Mario taking a shower. Hilarity Ensues, especially because you're actually controlling Toad at this point. When Mario leaves the bathroom he has a robe on him, and when he finds out about the current predicament, he quickly puts on his clothes and rushes off to the castle (and because Luigi was putting them out to dry, he is accidentally dragged along for the ride).
-   In _Max Payne 2_ after initially seeing Mona Sax only for a few seconds and thus learning that despite the events from the previous game she is still alive, Max decides to meet her later on. When he finally finds her in her secret hideout she is taking a shower. She is rather calm about this, which enforces her Femme Fatale image and asks Max for a towel.
-   In the sequel to _Mega Man Legends_, when Mega Man first sees Sera, she is completely naked.
-   Oleg is introduced this way in _Saints Row: The Third_.
-   Vatista introduces herself to Hyde (and Orie later on) in this fashion in _Under Night In-Birth_. After Hyde makes her put on clothes, she asks every other girl she sees around him if he took issue with them being naked as well.

    Web Animation 

-   In the "Poop Listeners" episode of _brewstew_, the narrator discusses why he doesn't want to be seen pooping. It's because he says that the image of a person pooping would scar them for life.

    Webcomics 

-   _The Bare Pit_ is focused on nudists at a resort, and in the first story line one character goes to the local downtown area but forgets to get dressed, meaning a lot of townsfolk get this impression of him.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Grace is in the middle of a "Not Wearing Pants" Dream when she meets a wizard acting as an emissary of magic within the dream. The wizard implies this is actually the third time they've met (presumably in the same way) and Grace just doesn't remember the first two times.
-   In _Girl Genius_, Zeetha and Gil meet for the first time although it's been heavily implied by the Foglios that, being fraternal twins, they've obviously met before when he's recovering from various wounds and she's been sent to make sure he's okay. Of course, being Zeetha, she neglects to tell him that he's naked until he's been walking around the room for a few pages. The whole twin thing makes this a little creepy, in retrospect, but neither of them know. She apparently works out that they're siblings later in the comic; notably, this is the point where she starts wearing clothes around him.
-   _My Best Friend Marneao_: After being summoned by Jacob, Marneao appears in his room completely naked. He then hugs Jacob at that moment. Jacob is speechless until Marneao materializes clothes on top of him. And this is how the comic begins, mind you.
-   In _Outsider_, this happens to the main character, Ensign Alexander Jardin. After the destruction of his ship by an unknown enemy, Jardin wakes up naked and on a medical gurney, with two of the other main characters in the room. As it turns out, he's on board the Loroi warship _Tempest_. An interrogation attempt knocks him unconscious, and he later wakes up in an isolation cell with his clothes back on, learning much later that the Loroi cut him out of his EVA suit when they rescued him.
-   In _Pokémon-X_, the main character Brendan meets May by walking in on her in the midst of changing, naked from the waist up, resulting in a love/hate relationship.
-   When Aaron first meets Tracy in _Pixie Trix Comix_, she's getting changed after modelling for her brother Felix — and wandering around his apartment at the same time. Aaron would only have caught a glimpse, though, except that Tracy, on hearing that he is (or claims to be) a writer, immediately assumes that, as a "creative", he'll be cool about her lack of modesty. Which is overestimating Aaron.
-   In _Seiyuu CRUSH!_, Kaji's first day at work results in his pants being pulled completely down.
-   _Sluggy Freelance_:
    -   Done in the aptly-named "Game Called on Account of Naked Chick".
    -   The first arc of "Oceans Unmoving" has Calix and Cada's first meeting, when the latter steps out of the bathroom wearing only pants and the former is reduced to a drooling idiot (which Bun-Bun uses as an excuse to fire him).

    Web Original 

    Websites 

-   In this Reddit comment, user i\_need\_sunshine recounts the time when they bumped into a lady as she was exiting the showers completely naked. The user's reply was to say she looked good and wink. This woman is now the user's mother-in-law.

    Web Videos 

-   Emma Blackery made a video describing the time she was dancing around her apartment in a towel, which fell off while she was in front of a window and a neighbor (whom she didn't know) got a full view of her naked body.

    Western Animation 

-   _Adventure Time_:
    -   Lemongrab first meets his "companion", Lemongrab 2, when LG2 walks into the room naked. Lemongrab is confused at first, then intrigued. He walks up to Lemongrab 2 and inspects him, then pokes him repeatedly. Lemongrab 2 responds by poking Lemongrab back. After that, they smile and nuzzle their faces together lovingly. Two episodes after that, the two Lemongrabs are shown to have had children together.
    -   In "Flute Spell", Finn first meets Huntress Wizard when she finds him bathing in a river, which doesn't seem to faze him much. She even winds up getting into the water with him, albeit clothed.
-   In the _South Park_ episode "Cartman Finds Love", the first time Token actually meets the new girl, Nicole, is when she comes into the boy's locker room as he's getting out of the shower. He's wearing a Modesty Towel, but the two are both embarrassed anyway. (Incidentally, the whole thing is a plot by Cartman to trick them into becoming a Token Minority Couple, as he apparently does to _every_ boy-girl pair of non-Caucasian students.)
-   _The Wild Thornberrys_: Not too surprisingly, the family first found Donnie, who was raised by an orangutan, when he vine-swung into their camp without any clothes on. They also met Darwin this way, since he is, y'know, a chimpanzee. He wears clothes most of the time, though.

    Real Life 

-   Cindy Crawford tells a _Playboy_ interviewer about an incident involving a Pepsi representative when Pepsi flew her down to Barbados for an international meeting:
    
    **Crawford:** One day my girlfriend and her boyfriend and I were sunbathing topless because that's Barbados — you can wear nothing if you want. And the Pepsi guy walks up and with my agent to meet us for lunch. I wondered should I put on my top because I have a business relationship with him? I didn't want him to get offended because the rest had seen me with my top off. Meanwhile, she's saying to my agent "I hope she puts on her top." He wasn't even being a schmuck, like wanting to see. He wanted to keep our relationship professional.  
    **Playboy:** Did you or didn't you?  
    **Crawford:** I left it off and it was fine with everyone.
    
    -   For the record, it's against the law in Barbados whether you look like Cindy Crawford or Dorota from _Gossip Girl_. Incidentally, _Playboy_ and its sort have been banned from the island since 1990 (curiously, this didn't happen until ones with nude men began being sold there).
-   The first time John Barrowman met his partner Scott was at one of his stage performances. Not only was he naked on stage as soon as the curtain opened, but Scott also got an eyeful when escorted to the dressing room of Barrowman, who was still in (no) costume.
-   When Winston Churchill was visiting Washington D.C. during World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt wheeled into his room for a chat, only to discover Churchill lounging around naked (as he often did at home). "Great Britain has nothing to hide from the United States," Churchill told him. Winston suffered from acutely sensitive skin; silk undies helped but not enough, which probably explains this habit of his.
-   While filming _Wonder Woman_, Gal Gadot and Connie Nielsen first met each other while they were both naked (for the makeup trailer). They play each other's daughter and mother respectively.
