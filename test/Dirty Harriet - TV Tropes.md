The baseline Dirty Harriet scenario is when a female law enforcement officer goes undercover in a role only a woman is expected to take, like stripper or prostitute. This allows for the natural tensions of undercover work, and of course also provides a reason for her to wear little clothing. Building on this, there are a number of other possible variations on the trope. The woman might not be proper law enforcement (perhaps she's a private detective, for instance), or the role might not be immediately connected to sex work (though still require her to wear sexy clothes). Or, it might actually be a male officer who is Disguised in Drag for similar purposes: perhaps the job is simply deemed too dangerous for a woman. In the latter case, unless it's played for laughs, it's likely that the guy looks good enough in drag to pass convincingly as a woman, at least at first glance. Or possibly, he is deliberately impersonating another Crossdresser, or a Transgender woman.

Note that while this _does_ happen in reality, it's very controversial, and legally and morally delicate. It has a very high chance of going spectacularly wrong and can easily turn into the sort of situation where a would-be arrestee is suing the city or the state or the feds for entrapment or worse. The real-life prostitution stings shown on various cop documentaries usually entail the undercover officer doing just the absolute minimum to make it absolutely clear that the client is really buying sex, and once money has changed hands excuse herself while her colleagues (who have been monitoring the situation from the next room or a parked car) storm in and make the arrest. This is also a uniquely American trope, given the varying legality of prostitution across the world.

This also appears in Spy Fiction. Serial Killer Baiting often involves this trope. See also Fair Cop. Almost never falls victim to Can Always Spot a Cop.

The term has also been used to describe female police officers depicted in film, TV, and literature as being just as deadly as their male counterparts (or, specifically, Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry character)<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . But that is not what this trope is about.

See Stripper/Cop Confusion for a humorous inversion of the trope.

If someone disguises themselves as a prostitute to commit different crimes, see Shady Lady of the Night.

    Literature 

-   In one Stuart Macbride's _Aberdeen_ detective novels the fanservice aspect is averted. The officers posing as streetwalkers are plain and unattractive because an attractive street-corner prostitute would make people suspicious.
-   In _Assassins of Gor_ Elizabeth Cardwell goes undercover in Ar as a slave girl. Of course, this being Gor and she being female, she immediately starts heading in the direction of Becoming the Mask.
-   _Dexter_'s sister Deb did this at the start of the first book when she was working in vice. The tone of the books is much more negative than that of the show and Dexter as the narrator spends some time on how incredibly unattractive Deb, a beautiful woman, managed to make herself look in such skimpy clothing. She wasn't trying, either; she has no fashion sense. By contrast, Deb in the show has a perfectly good fashion sense.
-   _Discworld_: Nobby Nobbs. Yes, he's a man, or at least male. It's complex.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  In fact, Nobby's looks are so astounding that a footnote made sure to point out that although narrative law would normally demand an Attractive Bent-Gender moment, the trope withered and died in the face of Nobby Nobbs.
    -   Even better: in one instance, his partner for that operation is the very attractive Sgt. Angua, a werewolf. Nobby can't imagine _she'd_ be the bait (and feels a lot safer with her as backup rather than the other way around).
-   In _The Golgotha Series_, Kate is a detective who goes undercover as a prostitute in Golgotha's brothel.
-   Holly Lisle's _Last Girl Dancing_ is a textbook example of this trope: the protagonist is a female cop who goes undercover as a stripper to find a serial killer.
-   In _Monster Hunter International_, Heather in _Alpha_ is mentioned to have worked undercover in such a position as a city police officer to bust a drug ring before returning to her hometown in Michigan and even jokes about it a bit to Harbinger.
    
    _"The one with all her teeth? That's the undercover cop."_
    
-   In _Shatterglass_, part of Tamora Pierce's _The Circle Opens_ Quartet, a serial killer stalks the female _yaskedasi,_ or members of the entertainment class. Quite a few police officers (of both genders, but mostly women) go undercover as _yaskedasi,_ but this is played straight when someone else comments that the grimly staring few who can't dance, juggle, or sing _really_ stick out.

    Live-Action TV 

-   On _21 Jump Street_, Judy joined the Jump Street program because it was the only way she'd be able to get any other type of assignment. Of course, this didn't mean that she didn't still get just such an assignment occasionally.
-   The pilot episode of _Airwolf_ features the F.I.R.M. getting an American agent employed as a belly dancer in Libya. Her cover is blown and she is killed later. They then decide to send in _another_ belly dancer, who gets kidnapped by the evil Dr. Moffett, tortured, and ends up dying from dehydration in the Sahara. As the second agent is a Love Interest of Stringfellow Hawke, her death gives him a personal stake in the mission to recover Airwolf.
-   _Angel_: In the original plan for the second episode, Kate Lockley was to be introduced as a police officer infiltrating a prostitution ring. In the version that made it to air, she was investigating disappearances from (or hanging out at) a popular singles bar. She would go on to become the Fair Cop love interest and occasional antagonist for Angel Investigations for the first 2 seasons.
-   In the reality series _Armed And Famous,_ both female celebrities (Trish Stratus and LaToya Jackson) went undercover during a prostitution sting. In contrast to typical portrayals, this wasn't played for Fanservice, and both were dressed very casually.
-   _Ashes to Ashes (2008)_: Alex Drake arrives in 1981 dressed as a prostitute. Later, in 1.05, she pretends to be one again - unfortunately for her, she isn't the mark's type.
-   _The Bill_: Cathy Bradford, but there are other examples.
-   One episode of _Blue Bloods_ has Jackie going undercover to catch a killer with a predilection for webgirls.
-   _Cagney & Lacey_: In episode 1 of season 1, no less, leading to Lacey's classic snark as she and Cagney stand on a streetcorner in extravagant hooker outfits:
    
    **Det. Lacey:** They call these plain clothes?
    
-   _Charlie's Angels_:
    -   The standard operating procedure of the Angels is to go undercover. Some of these assignments involve posing as prostitutes, exotic dancers, or in massage parlours, which gives many opportunities for Fanservice.
    -   In the first season finale, "Blue Angels", all three angels and Bosley go undercover in different places, and two of the assignments qualify as this trope: Jill impersonates a masseuese in a massage parlor (with Bosley as the manager). Sabrina goes undercover in the LAPD as a Phoenix vice detective, and is immediately ordered to impersonate a prostitute in order to infiltrate a different massage parlor.
-   _Cracker_, series 3 episode "Brotherly Love": Penhaligon dresses as a prostitute hoping to lure a man believed to be murdering prostitutes. There's extra tension in the put-on because Penhaligon was still recovering from being raped by a colleague.
-   In the Season 13 finale of _CSI_, Morgan goes undercover as a prostitute to try to find a serial killer. This entails her removing her dress, although we see nothing below the shoulders... and later almost ending up a victim of said killer herself.

-   _Dexter_
    -   When we first meet Deb, she's working in the vice squad (that would be Miami Vice), assigned to a prostitution sting operation, and is desperate to get assigned _out_ of it. Especially when she ends up helping out at a murder scene... still in her disguise.
    -   In season 3, Angel's new girlfriend is also undercover as a prostitute. Which he learns when he tries to hire her.
    -   Season 5:
        -   Officer Cira Manzon is chosen to impersonate a club thot as part of a sting to apprehend a dangerous gang leader.
        -   Maria LaGuerta agrees to be part of a sting to catch a Dirty Cop by suggesting a sexual liason. This creates tension with her husband Batista since he mistakes the whole thing for an affair she's having with an IAD detective.
-   _Father Brown_: In "The Crimson Feather", Bunty goes undercover as a burlesque dancer.
-   _Hill Street Blues_: In the season 5 episode "Davenport in a Storm", a number of female officers and detectives pose as streetwalkers to catch a serial killer targeting prostitutes. This is not played for fanservice (it's winter and even the street walkers wear covering clothes) but it is emphasized that the operation is dangerous; in fact, Det. Patsy Mayo asks to ride as backup rather than pose as a prostitute because of the risk.
-   In the first season of the 1980s cop show _Hunter (1984)_, Hunter's partner Dee Dee McCall poses as a streetwalker quite often (from the very first moment we see her, actually), usually to gather information rather than as a part of a sting operation. In later seasons she doesn't do it as often, but it still happens. Somewhat unusually, this is not played for fanservice, at least not in the case of McCall herself - she tends to wear considerably more clothes than her supposed "colleagues".
-   Ekaterina "Katia" Vorobyova in _The Interns_. To collect materials about prostitutes for new article, she herself pretended to be prostitute (they would only trust one of them). She took precautions in case someone would actually try to force her into sex, taking shocker, pepper spray and switchblade.
-   _JAG_: Mac goes undercover in season 5 as a Chief Petty Officer trying infiltrate a Wicca group, including getting herself sky-clad.
-   _Law & Order: Criminal Intent_: Detective Stevens poses as a High-Class Call Girl in order to get an interview with the madam of an exclusive escort service in "Gods & Insects". The squad room breaks into applause when she returns still in her outfit.
-   _Law & Order: SVU_: Happens often with Olivia Benson.
-   In _Lois & Clark_ she did this as a showgirl to get inside info on a crime ring. She was pretty good at it. Lex Luthor was highly amused when she appeared on stage. Meanwhile, Clark, who was working the same story undercover, fretted a lot and didn't have that much remorse fingering Lois to the female mob boss he's ingratiated himself with when they are caught sneaking around in order to preserve his cover.
-   One episode of _Legends_ has Crystal briefly going undercover as a stripper.
-   _Lost_ has a Show Within a Show called _Exposé_ about a group of secret agents undercover as strippers.
-   _Miami Vice_: Practically the only thing Gina and Trudy ever seem to do is go undercover as prostitutes. At least, this tends to be the only time they get the spotlight; otherwise they are mostly support for Crockett and Tubbs.
-   _Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries_: Phryne goes undercover as a Spanish fan dancer at a gentleman's club in "Murder Most Scandalous".
-   _NCIS_: In "High Tide", Bishop has to go undercover as an escort to help bust a drug ring. She cleans up so well that she is rated a "hard ten" by the perps.
-   _NYPD Blue_
    -   In one episode Det. Kirkendall goes undercover as a call girl to get evidence against a suspected murderer. The operation is portrayed as unusual and risky (since there is good reason to suspect that her customer will try to kill her), is not undertaken lightly, and is not played for Fanservice.
    -   Detective McDowell impersonates a prostitute to get close to a drug dealer who is surrounded by armed henchmen. It's not an extended undercover operation — as soon as she is in the same room as the dealer, her colleagues storm the place. In the resulting scuffle, her top (that didn't cover too much to start with) gets torn open, providing a gratuitous Lingerie Scene.
-   The 1985 TV movie _Operation Julie_ opens with a roomful of undercover police watching film footage of them pretending to be hippies to investigate drug selling at a pop festival. They especially appreciate the shots of their female colleagues walking around topless.
-   Pepper Anderson in the 70's series _Police Woman_ (played by Angie Dickinson) and her colleagues go undercover in almost every episode. Since she is the only woman in her squad, some of her assignments fit this trope. These usually involve wearing quite revealing clothing, which is played for fanservice. In at least one instance her cover is blown when she refuses to have actual sex with a client.
-   Happens all the time on _Reno 911!_, with a few different outcomes.
    
    -   Deputy Weigel, the squad Butt-Monkey, scares off the johns.
    -   Deputy Williams winds up knowing her young client from her old neighborhood and starts off giving him an angry lecture, before commenting on how well he's grown up and shutting off the recording equipment.
    -   At one point, the other deputies roust the prostitute hangout, only to find Deputy (Jim) Dangle among them, dressed as one. He tries to invoke the trope and convince them that he's undercover, but the others slowly catch on to the fact he is moonlighting as a gay prostitute as they leave.
    
    **Dep. Junior:** Doesn't he have Fridays off?
    
-   In _Robin Hood_ Kate pretends to be a drunken tavern wench in order to distract one of the outlaws' targets, a job that includes a low-cut dress and lots of makeup. She hooks up with Robin in the very next episode. Hmmm...
-   Played with in _The Shield_:
    -   A detective has to go undercover to catch a mob that's beating up prostitutes. _Male_ prostitutes. Shane is very upset when he's forced into the role.
    -   Shane has no luck with this kind of thing. In another episode, the Strike Team had to find out which stripper at a club was luring johns into the alley and then robbing them with her boyfriend. When Vic tries it, he gets a blow job. When Shane tries it, he gets a tire iron to the head.
-   Lois Lane in _Smallville_, although technically not as a cop but as a reporter. Not that anyone cared what her motivation was.
-   The first episode of _Southland_ briefly features a female vice cop undercover as a Streetwalker.
-   _Starsky & Hutch_: Starsky's ex-girlfriend turns out to have been undercover as a stripper in "Lady Blue".
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_. In "Preemptive Strike" Ensign Ro goes undercover to infiltrate a Maquis resistance group. She passes on her information to Captain Picard by meeting him in a bar, where she tells him to pretend he's buying her sexual services. This adds a level of awkwardness to their interaction (while Ro shares some Belligerent Sexual Tension with Commander Riker, she's never had any with Picard whom she regards more as a stern Parental Substitute). When they meet a second time, Ro has come to identify with the Maquis, so this trope gives Ro's actions as a spy a sleazy feel that doesn't make her feel any better about what she's doing.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_. On a couple of occasions Major Kira uses these tactics to infiltrate a Cardassian-controlled area, posing as a prostitute in "The Homecoming" and a comfort girl in "Wrongs Darker Than Death or Night".
-   _Third Watch_: Maritza Cruz, the tough-as-nails female cop (played by Tia Texada). The very first time we see her, working on a prostitution sting, she's wearing "six-inch heels with a postage stamp of polyester stuck up my ass."

-   One episode of _Two and a Half Men_ has Charlie getting busted by one of these. This clues him in that his sexual life is getting out of hand (not that sleeping with many women is news to him, but in this episode, he was so unhinged that he literally broke his balls after sleeping with six or seven girls in the same day).
-   Detective Shraeger in _The Unusuals_ starts out in vice, dressed as a hooker. She's soon transferred to homicide, though.
-   _White Collar_ has FBI agent Diana undercover as a prostitute in an episode of the second season as part of an operation to bring down a corrupt politician.
-   _Without a Trace_:
    -   In her first episode, Elena poses as a call girl to get information from a suspect. In "Candy", she goes undercover as a stripper.
    -   In another episode, Martin and Danny are interrogating a prostitute who was the last person seen with a missing judge when she mutters under her breath, "I'm a cop, so make this look good." They promptly begin yelling at her and roughing her up to maintain the facade of her being uncooperative.
-   _The Wire_: Played With. Kima goes undercover as a stripper, but not to catch some unsuspecting john. The Major Crimes unit is investigating a drug kingpin using the owner of his strip club, Orlando, to implicate key members of the organization.

-   Undercover cops posing as prostitutes became the topic of conversation in _Leftover Soup_ when ex-cop Cheryl is asked if she's ever done undercover work. She says she turned down the offer out of concern for her Identical Twin sister, and brings up the issue of how easily it can cross the line into entrapment—"you can't actually offer it...you have to just wear a short skirt and imply things." Jamie then asked if an undercover cop posing as a customer ever tried fake-soliciting an undercover cop posing as a prostitute, and how it turned out, prompting this response: "Last I heard, they're married with five kids." (And a comment from the writer: "Admit it, you'd watch that movie.")

    Western Animation 

-   _Arcane_: Vi has Caitlyn pretend she works at the brothel in order to get info from people, saying it ought to be easy given she's a Fair Cop.
