Bored now...

_"...I met this six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face and... the blackest eyes — the devil's eyes."_

Traditionally, a cheap and easy way to show that a character is evil is the use of colored contact lenses in live action, or colored or glowing eyes in animation. Since the 1990s, however, a new trend has emerged — the Black Eyes of Evil.

These days, when someone is possessed by demons, dabbling in the dark arts, psychically dominated by evil aliens, or gone evil in some other way, their eyes will go perfectly black with no whites at all.

Presumably this perfect blackness indicates the purity of the evil within them and their total lack of humanity. Even if a person's eyes are weirdly colored, there is still a possibility of human connection, but if their eyes are gaping wells of nothingness...

One interesting feature of this trope is that these black eyes will return to their normal state if the demon is exorcised/psychic link is broken/etc.

Alternately, a character's face can be shadowed in such a way that their eyes are completely hidden, or at most reflecting back a glint. Typically, these characters don't actually have black eyes and it's a temporary thing. This version can show up in characters who aren't the ultimate evil, merely sinister or mysterious. In many cases, heroic characters may also gain shadowed eyes in this way.

This can be surprisingly hard to tell apart from normal eyes in photos, because if a person has normal-colored eyes that happen to be deep-set or narrow to the point of looking squinty, then there won't be that much light hitting their sclera from most angles. It's easier to pick up on when the actor is in motion, and a lot more obvious in drawn art.

This is a subtrope of "Uh-Oh" Eyes, which, in turn, is a subtrope of Technicolor Eyes. These are also a specific type of Monochromatic Eyes; sometimes related to Prophet Eyes, which can also be used to indicate a supernatural or evil character, as well as Mind-Control Eyes, which are dull and flat-colored.

Compare Evil Wears Black.

Now in Real Life, scleral lenses worn by persons with light sensitivity will render a person's eyes completely black, but that doesn't tell you if they are evil or not.

Contrast with Black Bead Eyes, where the eyes are simply black dots done as an artistic style. Compare Black Eyes of Crazy, where black sclerae plus technicolor irises equals Ax-Crazy, although both heavily overlap with one another. Compare also Excessive Evil Eyeshadow. Overlaps with Ghostly Gape.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: Ayakashi corrupted by ikon have black sclera and white irises.
-   In the manga version of _The Big O_, Beck gets this after attacking Roger with the Gigadeus and getting blown away by a Chrome Buster. It's especially creepy as the chapter is structured in such a way that it's hard to tell if it's All Just a Dream or not (the imagery is _trippy_ for the series), and the part with Beck's eyes turning black is just a line and a full shot of Beck's head taking up a whole page. The last page. Which you have to _turn the page for_. And comes out of nowhere, but was hinted at as Beck kept asking Roger what Big O was showing him.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   Aizen's chrysalis stage of his One-Winged Angel form resulted in jet black eyes - no irises, no pupils, not even any visible eye sockets. Nothing. Just black eye shapes on top of a flat face-like surface that didn't even look like it could have eyes (it had no nose or mouth or ears, for example).
    -   As Nodt's black eyes are creepy and black and seem to gain a strange pale sheen at the edges when he uses his power to give them an even more alien look. It turns out to be a clue to the basis of his power which, in Vollstandig, targets the eyes of his victims.
-   In _Bungou Stray Dogs_, it's stated by Word of God that the more evil (or hopeless) a character is, the darker their irises are.
-   In _Death Parade_, Oculus has these, along with Hellish Pupils. While the show operates with Grey-and-Gray Morality, he is the closest thing the series has to a villain as he’s willing to maintain and uphold a problematic afterlife system for no clear reason.
-   In _Digimon Ghost Game_, the main protagonist's partner, Gammamon, sometimes displays these. When they show up, it's a sign that Gammamon is on the verge of evolving into GulusGammamon.
-   Majin Buu (specifically Super Buu, Evil Buu and Kid Buu) of _Dragon Ball Z_ fits both this and Black Eyes of Crazy to a T, having black sclerae and white (for Evil Buu) or red (for Super Buu and Kid Buu) irises.
-   In _Fairy Tail_, when Gemini takes the form of a human, sometimes, one or both of its eyes transform back into Gemini's original solid black eye. Although not particularly disturbing on Gemini itself, when the eye is on a human...man, it's scary! In the anime, in the scene when Gemini is posing as Gray cackling evilly and transforming into Lucy, Gray's transformation face could qualify as a Nightmare Face.
-   _Fist of the North Star_ features this trope relatively frequently, although it is almost always seen among the anime's main characters. Expect Kenshiro's eyes to become shadowed at least once during a fight, especially if he is angered, shocked or injured.
-   Jaki from _Gamaran_ has heterochromia: one is normal, the other is black with a white iris. Later, Ryuho Kibe's sclerae turns black when he uses Juugan, a battle drug.
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_ for the (former) page image, of course. The eyes change depending on the media, though. The anime goes for cat eyes, as do the sound novels. The manga artists change between this trope and cat eyes.

-   Both Polpo and Risotto Nero of _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind_ have these, and are vicious members of Passione.
-   _Kengan Ashura_: All members of the Kure Clan have black sclera, which signifies their status as a very influential clan of assassins. Members of this bloodline are able to "remove" the brain's natural inhibition on their muscle output (which their bodies can withstand thanks to centuries of selective breeding), which allows them to unleash Super-Strength. Their predecessor, the Wu Clan, also possess this trait.
-   Downplayed in _Mahoraba_. The Occult Research Club President has _almost_ entirely black eyes, with just a sliver of white at the outer edges. They still signify her Evil nature, which is more a case of being unholy than malicious.

-   Ken Akamatsu prefers black eyes to make his characters in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ look scary. He's also quite fond of Black Eyes of Crazy, too.

-   Combining Dou (anger) and Sei (calmness) ki in _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_ causes severe damage to the body, which notably causes a temporary blackening of the eyes. One of Ryuto's eyes is now permanently black and he is also wheelchair bound because of this technique. Shou Kanou's right eye also turned black and he implied that the damage wouldn't be as severe in his case. It's unknown if this is actually true or not.
    -   Alexander Gaidar and Tirawit Kokin both naturally have these features. And both are very scary guys.
-   In _Naruto_, Naruto's inner darkness has a constant Slasher Smile and eyes that are completely black.

-   All of the vampires in _Shiki_ have black sclera and red eyes when their Horror Hunger takes over. The older vampires, namely Chizuru and Sunako, take this further and have solid black eyes. They still have pupils and what not, you just can't see them unless they glow.
-   Averted with the _Super Dimension Fortress Macross_ character that would become Dr. Emil Lang in _Robotech_. Although Dr. Lang owes his black eyes to being touched by Vorlons, he remains a personable character. In the aborted _Sentinels_ animation, they did away with them and actually gave him normal eyes. They returned in recent comic book stories. In the original _Macross_, Lang was a minor unnamed background character and his all-black eyes was simply one of the trademark quirks of Haruhiko Mikimoto's character designs.
-   The _Tales of Symphonia_ OVA gives us Kvar. Once thought to be permanently squinty-eyed, Kvar was shown in the OVA to have red pupils in his otherwise wholly-black eyes. With that combination, it's no surprise that Kvar is one of the most despicable villains shown in _Symphonia_.
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul_, a Ghoul's Game Face involves black sclera and red pupils. These are known as "Kakugan", and used as a primary identifier of the species by authorities. Notably, One-Eyed Ghouls earn their name from only having a single Kakugan that marks them as half-breeds.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_:
    -   The Dark Signers from the anime.
    -   Kiryu from the manga.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   _Red Robin_ villains the "Daughters of Acheron" gain pitch black smoking eyes when using their abilities as a daughter of Acheron. The source of these powers is not explicitly stated but considering that Acheron is the river of pain and woe in Hades and the use of these powers on Tim Drake knocks him out for a good while and is considered to have come close to causing permanent damage when they weren't intended to they're rather dark.
    -   _Detective Comics (Rebirth)_: The League of Shadows's foot soldiers have scary black eyes.
-   The title character of _Hillbilly_, Rondel, was born with an Eyeless Face until a witch cut him some eyes. They appear as completely black holes in his face. He's actually the hero, but he's got some sinister abilities and is more than a little bit Creepy Good.
    -   In the "Red-Eyed Witchery from Beyond" arc, Rondel is faced with an extraterrestrial curse that turns people into its red-eyed minions. When trying to fight off its mind control at the story's climax, he ends his Badass Boast with a defiant "And my eyes are black!"
-   In the _Mickey Mouse Comic Universe_, Mickey has occasionally tangled with a trio of simian mad scientists named Professors Ecks, Doublex, and Triplex, who each have distinguishing features to tell them apart. One of Professor Doublex's unique traits is that he has black eyes with white pupils.
-   _The Punisher MAX_: During the "Up Is Down And Black Is White" arc, a mobster figures out the best way to get under Frank's skin is to desecrate his family's graves. Frank takes his usual violence against criminals Up to Eleven, and the art style makes it look like his eyes have gone completely black.
-   _Rat Queens_ shows these when Hannah calls upon her demonic powers instead of her usual necromancy.
-   _The Sandman (1989)_: Dream, a.k.a. Morpheus, also has completely black eyes, in which, at times, pinpricks of light like distant stars can be seen, as it is said that, by staring into his eyes, you can see the vast emptiness of eternity. He isn't evil, however, or not a typical villain at least, but he can be uncaring (to the point of cruelty) and takes very long to forgive a perceived slight.
-   _Marvel Universe_: The Sentry as The Void.
-   _Superman_:
    -   In _Supergirl_ story arc _Bizarrogirl_, the eponymous antagonist is not quite evil, but she is wild, violent and dangerous. And her eyes are black.
    -   The eyes of villain Mongul are nearly completely black with very tiny red pupils in _War World_, his first appearance. Subsequent artists ignored this trait, though.
    -   _Last Daughter of Krypton_: Reign is a blood-thirsty, sentient biological weapon, wholly devoted to conquering worlds and crushing the weak under her foot. Her eyes are completely pitch-black.
    -   "The Super-Steed of Steel": The alien race who intends to conquer Earth after murdering Supergirl have huge, black eyes with tiny white pupils.
-   _Mega Robo Bros_: Robot 23 has these.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Wonder Woman (2006)_: After taking on some of Genocide's power Alkyone's eyes turn fully black, with a bit of red. For extra emphasis on "evil", her pupils now look like skulls.
    -   In _Wonder Woman (2011)_ Hermes' former playful personality is given a revamp to make him more dour and pessimistic with a cruel streak a mile wide and his eyes are drawn as solid black. He's not necessarily evil, but he's not nice either and fits right in with the rest of the cruel Jerkass Gods of the pantheon.

    Fan Works 

-   _Jaune Arc, Lord of Hunger_: Darth Nihilus has black, monochromatic eyes after transforming into a Force Wound. Jaune's eyes also turn pitch black after he's possessed by Nihilus' spirit and Pyrrha finds looking at his eyes to be like staring into an empty void.
-   In the creepypasta _Sonic.exe_, the corrupted _Sonic the Hedgehog_ title screen features a Zalgofied Sonic.
-   The demon/witch Esmeralda from _Silent Dreamer_ by TheNight130 has black eyes with red pupils. When Alice accidentally receives Esmeralda's powers, her eyes turn the same.

    Films — Animated 

-   The Big Bad of _The Black Cauldron_, the Horned King, has pitch-black empty eye sockets as eyes by default, though they glow red (with a black pupil) whenever he's darkly excited or _very_ angry. In close-ups of his face, it is actually possible to see a very little white pupil in the middle of his empty black eyes.
-   In _Brave_. When Elinor turns into a bear, she still has human eyes. But the longer she stays a bear, her humanity starts to slip and she goes feral as her eyes become pitch black.
-   This is likely one of the things that makes the pink elephants in _Dumbo_ so disturbing. Not only are their eyes black, they appear to be empty sockets.
-   In _Finding Nemo_, when Bruce the shark gets the taste of blood, his pupils grow to the point where his eyeballs become completely black, like that of a real shark. Up until this point, he lacks irises, but the pupils are surrounded by white, like a common animated character.
-   Downplayed with Stitch from _Lilo & Stitch_. While he isn't evil, he is pretty nasty.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The vampires from _30 Days of Night_, which combined with their fang-like teeth makes them resemble sharks quite a bit.
-   In _The Axe Murders Of Villisca_, everyone possessed by the ancient evil in the house has their eyes turn black.
-   During the first exploration of Carl Stargher's mind in _The Cell,_ he manifests as a pale king with gaping black voids in place of eyes.
-   In _The Covenant_, the four members of the eponymous covenant as well as the villain, a descendant of a covenant member, all get these at some point in the film. Averted for the four members, who are all "good guys", although they're pretty dark antiheroes. Played straight for the villain.
-   In _The Curse of Sleeping Beauty_, when Briar Rose's true nature is revealed, and she announces her intention to unleash the demons upon the Earth, her eyes turn completely black.
-   Shivers the Clown from the _Fear of Clowns_ duology has a disorder that causes his eyes to appear almost completely black.
-   _Fright Night (2011)_ and _Fright Night 2: New Blood_ both had their vampires sporting black eyes when in kill-mode. Interestingly, the 1985 movie and its 1989 sequel used Supernatural Gold Eyes instead.
-   In _From Hell_, when Sir William Gull realizes he has been found out as Jack the Ripper by Inspector Abberline, his eyes turn black as he goes berserk and attacks the Inspector. Seeing as Sir William is a normal (if deranged) human being, this seems to be just for shock value. Possibly a reference to the comic, when during his death Sir William has a long out-of-body-experience that carries him all over the world and across time.
-   _Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum_: Anyone possessed by a ghost, like Ji-Hyun, Ah-Yeon, Je-Yoon, and Sung-Hoon, has their eyes turn pitch black.
-   _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_: Nebula, the antagonistic sister of Gamora, has black eyes as a result of cybernetic disfigurement by her father Thanos. However, she makes a Heel–Face Turn in the sequel and eventually becomes a full-fledged member of the team. It doesn't get rid of her black eyes, though.
    
    **Peter:** I just never noticed how black your eyes were.  
    **Nebula:** They were replaced by my father as a method of torture.  
    **Peter:** He... picked a pretty set.
    
-   _Halloween (1978)_: As related by Dr. Loomis, the villainous Michael Myers has "the blackest eyes... the devil's eyes." We never get a close-up to confirm this description, but the space behind the eye holes of Michael's mask is always completely obscured by shadow, giving him a blank white face and solid black eyes.
-   Pinhead and the rest of the cenobites from _Hellraiser_ movies always have either black, shark-like eyes or more subdued black eyes with white sclera, depending on the director and makeup artist.
-   In _Ink_, the Key Master Incubus has eyes that are pure black, occasionally flaring white with interest.
-   In _Invasion of the Bee Girls_, the titular monsters have compound black eyes.
-   Discussed in _Jaws_. Quoth Quint: "You know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye."
-   _Krull_:
    -   When the Seer is killed and replaced with a doppelganger, his duplicate has pure black eyes (not as much of a giveaway as you might think, since he usually keeps his eyes closed).
    -   Another creature from the same film, this one a female shapeshifter, is a subversion of sorts, as she finds herself unwilling to go through with her mission of killing the main character and gets quite a sympathetic speech before the Big Bad eliminates her for her betrayal.
-   The Dark Queen in _MirrorMask_ sports pitch-black eyes, as does her daughter. When Helena is used as a replacement for the Princess and given an appropriate makeover, her eyes turn black as well.
-   Possibly one of the earliest examples in film (1940) is in _The Mummy's Hand_, in which the mummy's eyes are completely black — an effect achieved by laboriously painting over the film in post-production.
-   _Mythica_:
    -   Marke's eyes go black when she uses her necromancy, which is very dangerous not only to others but her too, because it makes her unhinged. She has to continually resist going fully evil after using it, as it's both addictive to her and corrupting too.
    -   Szorlock has black eyes full time, the mark of a necromancer who's fully evil and corrupted, unlike Marek.
-   In _Nixon_, CIA director Richard Helms' eyes appear to turn completely black for a second due to a coincidentally-timed light reflection, right after Nixon muses that there are things worse than death, and right before Nixon continues that there's such a thing as evil. Needless to say, Helms' real-life relatives had some issues with that scene. Although Helms definitely was a ruthless bastard in real life, implying he was a soulless force of pure evil may have been pushing it. The scene was removed for the theatrical release and only viewable in the Director's Cut.
-   _Pokémon Detective Pikachu_: It is an established fact in _Pokémon_ lore that Ditto have Black Bead Eyes when they transform. However, in this movie, Ms. Norman the Ditto transforms into _humans,_ so the eyes become very disturbing and an example of this trope (hence why Ms. Norman has to wear big black sunglasses in all her human transformations).
-   In _Push_, whenever the evil pusher uses his powers, his pupils stretch so his eyes turn entirely black. The good pusher, by comparison, will only stretch her pupils so the irises are barely visible.
-   _Razors: The Return of Jack the Ripper_: When Jane touches the wall behind which the Ripper is imprisoned, the Ripper looks up and his eyes are completely black.
-   _Screamers: The Hunting_: The Five-Second Foreshadowing that a human is a Screamer, before sharp cutting instruments come bursting out of their bodies.
-   In _Sherlock Holmes (2009)_, a temporary version is used when Lord Blackwood is talking to Holmes in his cell. He's standing just out of the light, so that the areas around his eyes are completely shadowed and all that is visible is the evil glint.
-   _Shrooms_: Tara has them in some of the flashbacks during the ending.
-   The Santa mask worn by the killer in _Silent Night (2012)_ gives this effect.
-   Katherine Ross' doppelganger (intended to replace her after she's killed) in the 1975 adaptation of _The Stepford Wives_ has blank black eyes. (They're supposed to be empty eye sockets, but there was a minor Special Effect Failure.)
-   Though technically literature at one time, the script of Stephen King's _Storm of the Century_ — sold in book form, before it was made into the film it was designed to be (and likely afterward, depending on the director) — had a Big Bad whose eyes, upon possessing others, turned swirly black.
-   _The Thing (1982)_: The mutated Bennings-Thing had pitch black eyes. Palmer's eyes were also cast in shadow while everyone else's reflected light, and in the original script the pre-reveal dog thing's eyes were "black orbs".
-   Michael, vampire-werewolf hybrid from _Underworld (2003)_, has black eyes whenever he loses control. It's probably pupils stretching so far whites and irises are invisible, as is shrinks down to pupil size when he calms down.
-   In _X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes_, as the main character continues using the x-ray eyedrops, his eyes begin changing color: at first, they're only silver irises on black, but by the end of the film, they're entirely black.
-   _X-Men Film Series_:
    -   _X-Men_: Toad's irises are so big they look black from a distance.
    -   _X-Men: The Last Stand_: Jean Grey as the Phoenix.
    -   _X-Men: Apocalypse_: Xavier's eyes turning completely black as he declares, "I've never felt power like this before" is the result of Apocalpyse taking control of him to use Cerebro for disabling all of the world's nukes simultaneously. Everyone who is possessed during the process gets the same eye color.
-   Although it seems to take a while after the onset of zombification, the titular _Zombie Strippers!_ eventually develop pure-black eyes. Their flesh also begins to rot and their fingers turn black and sharpen into claws. Because the virus in the film affects men and women differently, this only seems to happen to female zombies.

    Folklore & Legends 

-   This one Urban Legend, in which people claim to have encountered "black-eyed children" (also known as "black-eyed beings" and "black-eyed kids", or just BEK), which are pretty much exactly what you would expect — creepy children with pure black eyes who are said to mean humans no good at all.
-   The Greys are generally depicted as having completely black eyes, though how evil they are varies depending on which UFO Conspiracy Theorist is telling the story. This is sometimes explained as a sort of "natural sunglasses" evolved to cope with the extra sunlight due to their homeworld having Binary Suns (often said to be the Zeta Reticuli system in UFO lore, though astronomers now consider it unlikely there are any planets there).

    Literature 

-   In the world of _Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter_ and _The Last American Vampire_, solid black eyes are part of a vampire's Game Face.
-   Magic users in _Almost Night_ get this when they use black magic, or anam.
-   Subverted in _Auf zwei Planeten_ by Kurd Laßwitz: The Martians' eyes can turn almost entirely black, but that is because they evolved on a planet much further from the Sun than Earth and so their pupils can dilate so much that they cover most of the visible parts of the eyeballs.
-   _The Barbarian and the Sorceress_: Barnabus gets black eyes when uses his sorcery. When his slave, Kira, uses sorcery against an Eldritch Abomination he's summoned, her eyes turn black as well.
-   _Circle of Magic_: The nameless unmagic mage in _Magic Steps_. Unlike the people who removed his legs and got him hooked on a powerful drug in order to make him help them with their crimes, he's not _evil_, but he's certainly no longer sane and has become very inhuman.
    
    _"When had all the white vanished from his eyes? Now it was like staring into two vast pits. She turned dizzy, as if she might fall, when she met his gaze."_
    
-   In _Coraline_, this is combined with Eyeless Face in the form of the Other World's inhabitants, who all have Black _Button_ Eyes of Evil. They can be any color according to The Film of the Book, but apparently, "black is traditional".
-   _A Court of Thorns and Roses_: Amarantha has black eyes and is evil to the core.
-   In _The Demon's Lexicon_ and the books that follow it, the eyes of demon-possessed people turn black. Nick also has black eyes, because he's a demon who's been possessing a human body since its birth, but he's an Anti-Hero.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   Zig-zagged with the Fae Queen Mab. Normally, she has Mystical White Hair and Icy Blue Eyes and is _plenty_ dangerous enough; when something personally offends her, she switches her hair and eyes to dead-black, which usually means it's far too late to run.
    -   Used straightforwardly in the case of the Red Court vampires, which turn black when they are hungry. It's a glimpse of their true forms (humanoid bat-creatures) under the human disguises.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   The god Fate, except, in his case, they aren't actually eyes, but rather openings into a boundless void. While he's not evil, per se, he's an unpleasant, abrasive Jerkass God who usually serves as an antagonistic force to the protagonists (for the simple reason that he exists to enforce the most likely outcome, while heroes are defined by their ability to defy the odds).
-   _Ferals Series_: The Spinning Man has pitch black eyes. When he possesses Selina, she gains these eyes as well.
    -   The eyes of Trymon, the villain of _The Light Fantastic_, after reading seven of the eight spells of the Octavo.
    -   Vorbis, the villain of _Small Gods_, has completely black eyes (described as a desert adaptation akin to wearing sunglasses inside your eyeballs).
    -   Mr. Teatime from _Hogfather_ has an artificial eye that is portrayed like this, while his remaining natural eye has a shrunken iris the size of a pinhole.
-   This is a sign of possession by some kind of alien superweapon in the _Eighth Doctor Adventures_ novel _The Fall of Yquatine_.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ novels, Sul describes Umbra as having eyes "like holes into nothing." However, Vuhon's eyes are pure white, instead.
-   The evil creatures in David Nickle's _Eutopia: A Novel of Terrible Optimism_. The cover is especially creepy.
-   _Ghost Girl (2021)_: Mr. Scratch's eyes, when unhidden by his sunglasses, are described as endless black with red pupils "like two perfect drops of blood floating in the dark".
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Averted with Hagrid ("a giant of a man with beetle-black eyes"), perhaps the most benevolent person in the series.
    -   Subverted with Severus Snape, whose eyes are consistently described as black — when he is introduced in _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_, the narration says "His eyes were black like Hagrid's but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and and made you think of dark tunnels." However, despite his unpleasant manners, behavior and history, Snape is firmly on Dumbledore's side.
-   The villain of _Heart-Shaped Box_ has eyes that look like they were scribbled out with a black Sharpie; another character refers to the black blotches as "sunglasses of the living dead".
-   Subverted by the Harshini in _The Hythrun Chronicles_ — they have obviously inhuman, solid black eyes, but are pretty much the nicest people you could possibly meet and, with the exception of Half Human Hybrids, utterly incapable of so much as contemplating the thought of violence or malice. Hence why they're almost extinct at the start of the trilogy...
-   The Ra'zac and Lethrblaka from the _Inheritance Cycle_. Averted by the black dragon Shruikan, who Eragon originally assumed would have these since most dragons have eye colors close to that of their scales. His eyes, however, are a startling blue, which Eragon describes as _worse_ by the madness visible within them.
-   In _The Locked Tomb_, the Ninth House, members of which typically have extremely dark, almost black eyes, isn't _evil_, per se, but it is a shitty place to live. Double Subverted with the Emperor, who has pitch-black eyes and is a necromancer of incredible power, but he's a kindly father figure sort of character, right up until it's revealed that he's a monstrous, manipulative, vengeance-driven, sadistic mass murderer, and has been the whole time.
-   In Lawrence Watt-Evans' _Lords of Dus_ series, the eyes of the King in Yellow are always hidden in shadow by the hood of his robe, although, occasionally, a brief glint is seen.
-   Though the most prominent character with black eyes in the _Modern Faerie Tales_ books, Kaye Fierch, is not evil, a lot of the other Fair Folk have black eyes and evil traits.
-   _The Mortal Instruments_:
    -   Valentine Morgenstern's eyes are described as black. He's also the genocidal Big Bad.
    -   Thanks to the demon blood, Sebastian/Jonathan had these at birth. Jocelyn was so repulsed by him she refused to care for him.
    -   Amatis Herondale when under the influence of the Infernal Cup.

-   _Prophet's House_ has the incestuous, theocratic Rassianus family who sport black eyes when exercising their prophetic powers.
-   Gaithim in _The Quest of the Unaligned_ gets these as a side effect of becoming a hoshek.
-   In _The Ragwitch_, the eponymous villain is described as having "black, black pupils". The horror.
-   Infected people transforming into the monstrous vampires in _The Strain_ gain "dead black" eyes, among other things. In the case of a Goth-Metal singer, people didn't even notice at first, they thought he still wore his pale make-up and black contact lenses...
-   In _Septimus Heap_, the eyes of users of **Darke Magyk** turn dark themselves.
-   The Big Bad of _Sword of Truth_ books has these as part of being a Dream Walker. If that wasn't creepy enough, everyone knows when he's looking at them, even though his eyes are effectively black spheres. It's never explained.
-   Subverted by Shane DeSoto in _Super Powereds_. Whenever he uses his ability to animate shadows into blades, his eyes go solid black. However, he's a really nice guy who tries everything he can not to use his power lethally, is polite and kind to pretty much everyone, and even apologizes for fighting Vince pragmatically in Year 2. But as he showed off in the Year 4 tests... don't get on his bad side.
-   _Tales of the Ketty Jay_. An Invoked Trope by Trinica Dracken who wears black contact lenses to give herself a ghoulish appearance.
-   The Nightmare Queen in _Terra Mirum Chronicles_ is recognized as a Nightmare for having these eyes.
-   _The Wheel of Time_:
    -   People permitted to draw directly on the Dark One's power gain tiny motes of darkness that float horizontally across their eyes, becoming more and more numerous until their eyes black out entirely. The Dragon to the Dark One gains them by the end, at which point the power had driven him completely insane.
    -   On a more mundane level, the Aiel are often referred to with the epithet "black-eyed", especially when meant negatively. Actual Aiel usually have blue or hazel eyes, and anyone who's fought them would know this, whereas most people ignorantly take the term at face value.
-   Arpazia and Coira in _White as Snow_ have "cold water eyes" normally, a color that's not quite blue or gray, but when their pupils dilate, their eyes appear to be black. With Arpazia in particular, this is taken as a sign of witchcraft, or at least insanity.
-   SandWings in _Wings of Fire_ have completely black eyes without pupils or sclerae like this, including Burn and Blister. There are also heroic SandWings who avert this, though.

    Live-Action TV

    -   Kelly gets this when possessed by Eligos in "Brujo" and "The Host".
    -   After Ruby reveals herself to have been Evil All Along, her eyes turn black while threatening or fighting Ash.
-   _Babylon 5_ was one of the first to use this trope: When telepath Lyta Alexander makes psychic contact with the Big Bad Shadows, her eyes turn pure black, but return to normal when contact is broken. After prolonged contact, she also began to weep black tears. Similarly, when she makes psychic contact with the Vorlons, her eyes glow green.
-   _Battlestar Galactica_ has this occur in a deleted scene of the episode "The Farm". Starbuck has a nightmare where she sees Anders with black eyes. Considering what he is revealed to be, it is interesting.
-   _Being Human_ (both versions) has the vampires using all-black eyes as a Game Face.
-   Averted with Henry Fitzroy in _Blood Ties (2007)_, whose eyes go black for his Game Face and during hypnosis, as he is a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire (more or less).
-   _The Boys (2019)_: Stormfront has these overlapping with Glowing Eyes of Doom. When she's using her Shock and Awe powers at high intensity, her eyes turn pitch-black with dots of majenta light in the center (which might or might not be reflections of the lightning bursts). And boy, is she anything _but_ a Villainy-Free Villain once the audience gets their first glimpse of who she really is.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   This seems to be one of the standard side effects of using powerful Black Magic, as primal energy fills up the body of the caster and then is released through the spell. When the black eyes don't fade after the spell is done, something's generally wrong.
    -   When Willow Rosenberg goes overboard with magic, she gets these, most notably in her Dark Willow phase. In season seven, she gets these when she invokes powerful magic. They fade when the spell in question ends. The dark arts also darkens her hair, causing to complain that she can't get any work done without getting dark roots. Interestingly, she also becomes a Jerkass while she is using such magic. In one scene, while using a powerful barrier spell to stop a demon, she tells the woman she is protecting to stop whining. After the demon leaves, she apologizes.
    -   Catherine Madison, the first witch actually seen on the show, got these as she casts a powerful spell. As does her daughter, Amy.
    -   Oz's eyes turn solid black as part of his transformation into a werewolf and are usually one of the first things to change. Black eyes are not a standard werewolf trait per se though, as Veruca's turn bright blue.
    -   Caleb's eyes turn black when he is merged with the First, which also turns his blood an oily black.
    -   In the episode "Forever" there is reason to believe this won't turn out so well when the nice man with the spell to bring back the dead goes black in his eyes.
-   _Carnivàle_: Brother Justin, Henry Scudder, and Sofie all have obsidian orbs when they tap into their innate evil.
-   _Charmed (1998)_:
    -   Demons sometimes sport these. The Source of All Evil adds licks of hellfire in them for effect.
    -   Beings possessed by the Nexus or the Hollow also sport black eyes, though these powers are technically neutral (in the same way that an Eldritch Abomination doesn't care about the struggles of morality).
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   When the Master is summoning Azal in "The Dæmons", a few shots use the Hidden Eyes version of this trope: he's lit in such a way that his eyes are completely obscured by the shadow of his browbones.
    -   "Tooth and Claw": The werewolf virus' host body has completely black eyes in the human form.
    -   "The Next Doctor": The Femme Fatale gains pure black eyes when the Cybermen forcibly "upgrade" her to be their new Cyberking (noun/gender agreement notwithstanding). As befits the trope, her eyes return to their normal colour when the Doctor forces her to look as a human at what she has become, leading her to suicide explosively and take the Cybermen with her.
-   In _Farscape_, the mysterious representative of the Ancients (nicknamed "Einstein" by Crichton) appears to others as a tall, impeccably-dressed human with pitch-black eyes. However, Einstein and the Ancients remain neutral throughout the series.
-   In _The Flash (2014)_, Zoom's eyes are entirely black, although he can make them glow blue, if he wants, similar to the Reverse-Flash making his eyes glow red.

-   The eponymous monster in _Ghoul_, which takes on the form of whatever person it last ate, adopts black eyes every time it shows its true form.
-   Inverted in _Grimm_, where it's the titular monster hunters who are seen this way by the Wesen when they woge in front of them. The Wesen see the Grimm's black eyes reflect their nature back at them.
-   On an episode of _A Haunting_, a devil or demon is shown to look like a regular man, except for the black eyes...which made the actor look \[bleep\]ing scary.
-   In _Heroes_, Maya's eyes turn pure black with tar-like tears running down her face when her powers activate. While she's not really evil, her ability—to kill everyone around in a matter of about a minute using what amounts to some sort of psychic poison—_is_.
-   The BBC's _Jekyll_ uses this as one of the warning signs that Hyde is about to show up, and they're one of the few cosmetic changes made to show the difference between the main character's two personalities.
-   _Kamen Rider Kuuga_. When protagonist, Yuusuke Godai, first receives visions of his Ultimate Form, Ultimate Kuuga, the coloring of his eyes are pitch-black, symbolizing the risk of his becoming evil should he transform into Ultimate Kuuga. In the penultimate episode, Yuusuke does, in fact, transform to Ultimate Kuuga, but due to his self-control, manages to retain the red-eye coloring of his normal Mighty Form. The risk of slipping into 'Black-Eyed Ultimate Kuuga' is not entirely eliminated, however, and Yuusuke, in fact, tells his partner, Ichijou, to shoot him should it happen.
    -   In _Kamen Rider Decade,_ we got to meet black-eyed _Rising_ Ultimate Kuuga. You can say Oh, Crap! now.
-   In _Legend of the Seeker,_ it's not presented as evil (at least insofar as stealing a person's soul and free will is presented as "not evil"; the show's basically taken the route of "types of magic aren't evil, it's what you do with them"), but whenever a Confessor uses her power, there is a close up of her eyes (and the eyes of her victim) turning pure black for a few moments. This isn't the case in the original books, though the effect is somewhat similar to the villainous Emperor Jagang's permanently black eyes.
-   In _Lexx_, solid black eyes represent possession by His Divine Shadow.
-   _The Librarians_: In "And the Apple of Discord", the titular magical artifact turns whoever is holding into the worst version of him or herself.

She also plans to do the most damage by blowing up a huge chunk of Europe's power grid.

-   In _Smallville_, whoever is possessed by Bizarro gets black eyes. Also occasionally the case for Brainiac's or Darkseid's victims.
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   This is present in the majority of demons, although their human hosts usually only show it when the demon is expressing malevolence or using its powers. Some of the elite demon castes have different eye colors instead.
    -   In the Season 4 finale, Sam Winchester gets these when juiced up on a massive amount of demon blood and trying to kill Lilith. Where the "evil" part comes in is Castiel indicated that if God hadn't cleaned the demon blood from Sam's system in the next episode, Sam's demon blood O.D. would've likely turned into something just as bad as the demons.
    -   Chuck, who is revealed to be a case of God Is Evil, gains a _partial_ one in Season 15 after he merges with The Anti-God.
-   _Star Trek_: several antagonistic species have Black eyes including the Hirogen and the \[modern depiction\] of the Gorn, however the most notable enemy are the Borg, including their Borg Queen.
-   _Sweet Home (2020)_: Infected people's eyes turn black when they come close to becoming monsters.
-   Not quite the same thing, but a body modification-centric episode of _Taboo_ featured a man injecting black tattoo ink into the whites of his eyes.

-   In _True Blood_, people under Maryann's control have totally black eyeballs.
-   In the revival of _Twin Peaks_ ,Cooper's doppelganger, Mr. C, has black eyes.
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   The black oil is one of the most effective applications of this trope. This living substance violates its hosts' bodies through various orifices. Eyes turning black means that the substance has taken over.
    -   Used with the surprisingly sympathetic Monster of the Week in the episode "Hungry".

    Music 

-   Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland regularly wore contact lenses onstage that made his eyes look like this.
-   "Blackest Eyes" by Porcupine Tree is a song about serial killers with the lyrics "_Swim with me into your blackest eyes_".
-   The Villain Protagonist Desdinova from Blue Öyster Cult's rock opera _Imaginos_ has eyes like "bottles of blackness, the blacker to spare".
-   2D from Gorillaz has these, although this case would be some sort of subversion, since he's generally nice and often a source of comic relief. Also, the trope is justified, because they're apparently not really black eyes, but eight-ball fractures, caused by having them dented into 2D's eye sockets, which gave him his nickname (2 Dents).
-   "Spectrum" by Zedd features a music video that shows a woman (presumably from outer space) with pitch black eyes who falls in love with a man from Earth. They have a romantic relationship and wear sunglasses in order to hide the uncannily human alien woman's black eyes from the public. _Here, watch it for yourself._
-   The "Mother Maiden" Character from the eponymous music video by Dutch rock/metal band Within Temptation is revealed to have eyes just like this.
-   The music video for "Ov Fire and the Void" from Polish Death Metal band Behemoth has one in the main female character.
-   The woman on the cover of Diary of Dreams' _Elegies in Darkness_.
-   Tenacious D's "Tribute" has the band making a CD about a demon in a shopping mall karoke studio. While the band are dragged away by security a little old lady takes the CD, her eyes glow read and she laughs manically.
-   A couple PVRIS songs make reference to eyes with missing whites as a bad sign, such as the song “Mirrors”:
    
    _Your dead eyes before mine  
    The way they're missing their whites, yeah, they're just right_
    
-   This trope is a focal point of Chelsea Wolfe's "Feral Love":
    
    _Your eyes black like an animal  
    black like an animal  
    crossing the water-  
    lead them to die..._
    
-   In the video for Poets of the Fall's "Lift," Mad Dreamer and implicitly Ax-Crazy jail inmate Mark manifests matte black eyes briefly during his psych screening when the female psychologist evaluating him confronts him with an evidence bag containing a red ball-head straight pin. Though his mouth is out of frame, his expression implies that he's _smiling_ at the sight of it.
-   The music video of Muse's "Dead Inside" shows a woman with black eyes and a man dancing in a field of chalk dust, effortlessly managing to combine seduction and contention in their moves. In the end, the man's eyes turn black like the woman's.

    Podcasts 

-   Cecil in _Welcome to Night Vale_ describes Kevin as having black eyes and says "he must be _wicked_, this man'', despite Kevin describing Cecil as having "eyes like mine"; though since Cecil's had all of his mirrors covered since he was fifteen, he might have similar eyes and not know it.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   In addition to have what appears to be a bleeding skull mask, Bolivian wrestler Estertor's eyes also seem to be pitch black, making him look kind of disturbing.
-   The Big Bad of CHIKARA's 2014 season, Deucalion, was revealed to have these. Given his proclivity for executing wrestlers who defied him or failed him, he was unquestionably evil.

    Roleplay 

-   One of the symptoms of frequent exposure to the Void between worlds in _AJCO_. While it remains to be seen if the Auditor has them due to her Scary Shiny Glasses, A\_J certainly does. Partially due to the fact she's taken so many trips through it and partially due to the fact that in the years before her first trip she was in close contact with it every single day.
-   In _Roll To Dodge: Savral,_ pitch black eyes usually indicates that a character has been possessed by the setting’s demonic unicorns.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Several examples from _Magic: The Gathering_:
    -   This was a symptom (along with greasy black tears) of the Phyrexian oil in _Time Spiral_. Naturally, the people living in black-aligned places got the worst of it.
    -   In "Shadows of Innistrad" this is the mark of corrupted angels, especially Avacyn herself.
    -   In the city plane of Ravnica, there are several factions of angels, and the ones inhabiting the Corrupt Church guild of Orzhov possess black eyes.
-   The Excrucians of _Nobilis_ have a variant on this. Falling stars drift through their otherwise-black eyes.
-   Dark Fantasy and Modern Horror roleplaying games from the 1990s onwards love this trope, from _Old World of Darkness_ to the German game _Arcane Codex_ (where this is actually a trait buyable at character creation called "Eyes of Hell" that indicates the character is a half-breed who has demonic blood).
-   of the _Warhammer 40,000_ 'verse:
    -   Used with the Night Lords. Each original member of the Legion has enormous pupils, along with irises and scleræ that are totally black. It gives them nearly perfect night vision: bright lights can cause tissue damage to their eyes along the lines of Tears of Blood. Justified, since the Legion recruited all of its members from its homeworld of Nostramo, where the human population lived in thousands of years of isolation and adapted to Nostamo's state of perpetual darkness. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Within canon, this is a Zig-Zagging Trope (being the only army in the Imperium who extensively utilized terror tactics), but played straight after their Primarch declared "Then Let Me Be Evil".
    -   Generally averted in the tabletop game, where they all wear helmets, and probably need them in most conditions. This is also averted with normal Space Marines descended from the Raven Guard. A defect in their gene seed causes most of them to become Eerie Pale-Skinned Brunettes.
    -   Also notable are the Cacharadons whose eyes are also completely black, and tend to be a bite more... violent and brutal than the other loyalist chapters.

    Theatre 

-   In _Ride the Cyclone_, "Jane Doe", the girl who lost her head in the accident on the eponymous roller coaster, and with it her identity, has solid black eyes in the afterlife, depicted via black-out contact lenses.

    Toys 

-   Karzahni from BIONICLE was first described as having empty, black eyes. Later, a book illustration gave him brightly glowing yellow eyes (and took other liberties with his colors), and his eventual figure sported red eyes. The change is somewhat justified in the figure's case, as it represented his mutated form, which didn't look anything like what his original description suggested. There's also the fact that Karzahni constantly rebuilds himself, so he may have possibly changed his eyes...
-   The villainous teams in _The Grossery Gang_ are designed with black eyes with red pinprick pupils, instead of the standard white eyes with black pupils that the standard Grosseries have.

    Video Games 

-   If you are trying to reach the happy ending in _Afraid of Monsters_, you have to fight your Doppelgänger, who has completely black eyes.

-   _Arrogation: Unlight of Day_ ends with you saving your sister from a Human Sacrifice ritual, where you try shaking her awake. Unfortunately, she opens her eyes and reveals them to be pitch-black, revealing that your attempts to have her exorcised didn't quite work.
-   Your father, Bhaal, has many forms in _Baldur's Gate_, but one thing remains the same in all of them: his pitch-black eyes. In the same vein, a couple of your prophetic dreams have you looking into a mirror or body of water and seeing your reflection with a Psychotic Smirk and the same black eyes.

-   _The Bureau: XCOM Declassified_. A seemingly human housewife has these in the E3 2010 trailer.

-   In the _Civilization 4_ mod Rise of Mankind, the leaderhead for Richleiu has, inexplicably, completely black eyes. While likely just a glitch, or an incomplete design, it does make him fairly creepy.
-   The Bearminator, a huge polar bear, has some pretty scary black eyes in _Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back_ and _Crash Bash_.
-   A few of the character designs for the mutant enemies in _Destroy All Humans!_ feature black eyes.
-   The Outsider, the resident Eldritch Abomination of _Dishonored_ has completely black eyes. However, he's not so much evil as simply a disinterested entity who enjoys observing humanity and the chaos they can create, occasionally granting powers to rare individuals that gain his interest.
-   In _Double Homework_, Dennis’s dad has these. They add to the man’s threatening aura, which is already established when the protagonist likens his open limo door emitting smoke to a dragon’s den.
-   Subverted with the Lady of the Forest from _Dragon Age: Origins_. Although she possesses pitch-black eyes, she is not evil, only inhuman. In fact, she wishes to end the curse that has been placed upon the werewolves of the Brecilian Forest, even though doing so will require her death.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   Some Vampire bloodlines have this as a trait. Others instead have pale white Empty Eyes with no pupils or irises, while others still have Supernatural Gold Eyes. (It's implied that they may all have these glowing gold eyes, but only beings with divine souls, such as the Dragonborn of _Skyrim_, can actually see them.)
    -   In _Skyrim_, this is a trait of the Dremora, an intelligent race of lesser Daedra who are most commonly found in the service of Mehrunes Dagon as his Legions of Hell. (Other games give them red or gold eyes instead.)
    -   In _Online_, this is a trait of Scamps, the weakest and smallest known form of lesser Daedra. Other games have variously given them red eyes or blank Empty Eyes.
-   In _Embric of Wulfhammer's Castle_ , this afflicts all those who drink the demonic scotch. It also afflicts Ecinacea, due to her having been replaced by an Eldritch Abomination.
-   Kerillian from _The End Times: Vermintide_ has pitch-black eyes, like a shark. Subverted because she isn't evil or crazy, she's just kind of a bitch.

-   The killer 'bots in _Five Nights at Freddy's_ usually have animatronic eyeballs, but sometimes just empty black space with tiny pinpricks of light to make it clear that they can still see you.
    -   William Afton (the true identity of Springtrap/The Purple Guy) has also been seen with similarly colored eyes in minigame cutscenes.
-   In _Haunted Legends 5: The Stone Guest_ anyone who's under one of the curses cast on various voodoo dolls by the villain has a chalk-white face with dead black eyes that have cracks radiating out from them.
-   _Jak and Daxter_: Jak's Superpowered Evil Side has these, as do Daxter's and Skyheed's.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   Inverted with the asari, Liara. If you choose to have her as your romance partner, her eyes will turn black while you're having a roll in the sack with her. Her eyes also turn black when activating telepathic linking powers — something observed in another asari, Shiala, an asari Commando, who links with your character during the Feros mission. If you look closely, they aren't solid black, but have faint star-like lights in them.
    -   Played straight when Morinth does it - that an asari's eyes turn black just before sex has a whole new effect when the asari in question is an Ardat-Yakshi, especially since they lack the faint lights seen in other asari.
-   Master Albert in _Mega Man ZX_ combines this with Red Eyes, Take Warning. No, really.
-   The Shade, the demon behind the events of _Mystery Case Files: The Countess_, appears as a black version of lady Gloria Codington with pitch-black eyes with glowing white irises.
-   _Ōkami_ subverts this. Ammy is the hero, but has pitch black eyes. Can become terrifying if you look at her face when using the "Realistic Wolf" karmic transformer.
-   _Persona_:
    -   Takahisa Kandori from _Persona 2_ used to wear Sinister Shades. Why? He has _nothing_ behind them.
    -   Mitsuo Kubo from _Persona 4_, a really creepy loner whose most prominent feature is his black fish eyes. He eventually kills resident Sadist Teacher Mr. Morooka over a grudge and attempts to claim the murders currently taking place in Inaba.
-   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_, Dahlia has these, foreshadowing that she's evil. It's part of her Animal Motif.

-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_: Artwork of the American/European style of Dr. Robotnik usually depicts him with no eyes at all, with two pitch black eye-sockets instead (original Japanese artwork clearly shows him to be wearing black, tea shade-like eyewear<small>◊</small>). In _Sonic Adventure 2_, the Boom Boos from the haunted stages have a pair of black eyes which blinks every few seconds. When you hit them once, however, they will turn into the creepy, yellow-eyed, slasher smiling Attack Boos.
-   _Star Wars Legends_:
    -   When Kreia unveils herself as a Sith Lord in _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_, her eyes turn from milky white to pitch black.
    -   The Sith Emperor from _Star Wars: The Old Republic_ has pitch-black eyes from birth. It is a sign of his great evil and power. Vector Hyllus and all other Killik Joiners also has completely black eyes, though, while he is part of the Imperial Agent's entourage, he's not evil so much as following Blue-and-Orange Morality and is actually the nicest person in their party.
-   In _Star Wars Infinities: The Empire Strikes Back,_ an Alternate History of ''Star Wars Legends'', Anakin Skywalker takes these on when he attacks Yoda inside Darth Vader's mindscape.
-   M. Bison from _Street Fighter_ has all-black eyes, except for the irises (normally black), which are white. That was in his early designs. Averted afterwards, when his eyes were changed to be completely white.

-   While he is by all accounts a heroic character, _Undertale_'s resident Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass, Sans, has this trope as one of his defining character tropes. When being serious, his eyes go completely dark, almost as if he is addressing the player directly.

    Web Animation 

-   _Spooky Month_:
    -   Inverted. Skid and Pump have white on black eyes as part of their costumes, but the two are innocent little kids who just want to have fun, even if they accidentally cause chaos as they go.
    -   Frank is a kidnapper who swipes kids off the streets and ransoms them back to their parents; his eyes are fully black with little white pupils, and unlike Skid and Pump, he's not wearing a costume, implying the color is natural.

    Webcomics 

-   Chloe from _Angel Down_ has entirely black eyes due to an injury that also blinded her and scared her upper face. However, despite her implied demonic heritage, she isn't evil, and is simply an Emo Teen.
-   While not evil, Clara from _A.P.O.C_ has black eyes. She's not sure how she got them, but they seem connected to be connected to hosting the Horseman of Death within her.

-   This was used in _El Goonish Shive_ as part of the effects to show a particularly intense Death Glare. It's also present on both Lord Tedd and Tedd when he activates his gauntlet. Subverted when it's eventually revealed this is just the effect of Tedd using extra power, and the fact Lord Tedd is evil and Tedd was angry the first time he did it is just coincidence.
-   Bloody Mary from _Flipside_ has these, though she does still have visible pupils, allowing us to _somewhat_ connect with her as she transforms into The Woobie.
-   Found on Captain Vole of _Girl Genius_, an ex-Jagerkin (no, we're not sure how that works either) who is hell-bent on killing any Heterodyne that comes his way, including Agatha.
-   All the titular characters in _Goblins_ have this, whether hero or villain.
-   Zimmy from _Gunnerkrigg Court_ is initially presented as this: she's antagonistic and seems to have dark holes where her eyes should be. However, subsequent chapters make her The Woobie. Dark Is Not Evil, indeed. Also, it turns out she does have eyes: they're just perpetually/stylistically covered by black gunk.
-   Subverted in _Homestuck_. Sollux winds up with these after a duel with Eridan goes badly, but he's actually much more relaxed now that he doesn't have to deal with his psychic powers anymore. As a half-ghost in the farthest ring, he has one eye that's solid black, and the other that's solid white, to indicate he's not entirely alive or dead.
    -   Later subverted again with the incredibly kind Calliope, though the effect is a bit unnerving.
-   In _Last Res0rt_ black eyes with red irises are an undeniable sign of being a Djinni-si, or "dead inside". Vampires are capable of hiding their "dead" eyes though. Also a bit of YMMV on whether that automatically makes one evil too.
-   Despite being a benevolent entity, Caprice from _A Miracle of Science_ gets totally black eyes and the Voice of the Legion when Mars is talking.
-   _Moon Crest 24_: (Averted) Derek has what are basically black circles for his eyes with no sclera to speak of, but is far from evil.
-   In _Our Little Adventure_, kobolds would be cute if their eyes weren't large, black, soulless eye sockets.
-   In _Paranatural_, Mr. Spender wears Sunglasses at Night for a plethora of reasons, including to hide that his eyes are completely black, though not because he's evil, but because he's possesed by an evil, mysterious spirit and the only things holding it back are himself and the spirit inside his sunglasses.
-   In _Polandball,_ when writers want to portray characters as scary or creepy, they may draw the character with all black eyes.
    -   Most of the time, this works in distilling fear into readers, because it is in jarring contrast with the completely _white_ eyes they usually have.
-   In _Pumpkin Flower_, all Mancers have black eyes, including the main character.
-   In _Sam & Fuzzy_, the heavy metal band Noosehead (which has 15 members) has several members with monochromatic black eyes of evil. This includes their front man, Sidney "the Sicko", and main guitarist, Nicole. As it turns out, when they end up taking the stage during the "roadies" arc, they are a subversion: all of them are really nice (if a little eccentric) people who treat the heavy metal life as a job.
-   _Slightly Damned_: Sakido gets solid black eyes when she goes berserk while trying to get Buwaro and Rhea out of Hell, when she touches Buwaro's star pendant she regains partial sanity and (ironically) gets Black Eyes of Crazy.
-   _Spina Cage_ has a race of human eating faeries with completely blacked out eyes.
-   _S.S.D.D._: Robert. While not evil, he admits his eyes make people feel ill and scare children.
-   _A Tale of Fiction_: Sneaky's eyes are always black, no matter how much shapeshifting he does. Subverted, though, because he's a nice guy and the protagonist. While shapeshifted into human form, he usually wears sunglasses to blend in.
-   Babi Rusa, a cannibal hag, has all black eyes, in _Witchprickers_. Interestingly, the comic's hero, Ilemauzer the bat, also has black eyes at first.

-   _The Legend of Vox Machina_: Whenever Percy confronts a person listed on one of the barrels of his gun, he gains black eyes with sinister orange irises. In addition to the smoke that surrounds him during these moments, this is a sign of the increasing control that Orthax, the demon of vengeance that he unwittingly made a pact, has on him as he kills more targets.
-   _The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack_ had this cat...yeah.
-   In the _Skylanders Academy_ episode "Split Decision", Hex gets these when she turns evil after Skull breaks his contract with her, and anyone she spreads her evil to gets them as well.
