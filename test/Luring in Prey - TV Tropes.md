**Captain Jack Aubrey:** A nautical phasmid, Doctor. At least, to a hungry eye, if one has an appetite for whalers. I intend to take a greater interest in the bounty of nature from now on. I had no idea that a study of nature could advance the art of naval warfare.  
**Dr. Stephen Maturin:** Oh, I see.  
**Jack:** Now to pull this predator in close and spring our trap.  
**Stephen:** Jack?  
**Jack:** Yes?  
**Stephen:** _You're_ the predator.

Not all monsters are active in tracking or chasing down prey; some would much rather that their victims come to them. The trouble with being an ambush predator, however, is that you need to find some way to guarantee that food will actually come in your direction, or else starve in your little secret hidey-hole. As such, some monsters come with all sorts of clever tricks, sometimes very elaborate ones, to trick their victims into walking right into their open jaws.

The more sedate examples of this trope are usually based fairly directly on animals that use this strategy in real-life. Anglerfish, with their glowing or food-shaped lures, are among the more common inspirations; other beasts may draw from such examples as the alligator snapping turtle's worm-shaped tongue or the spider-tailed horned viper's arthropod-like tail tip. More elaborate examples can get very baroque in the complexity of their lures; some, rather than just having general resemblances to something desirable, may have extremely realistic mockups of people, food stands, treasure chests, lottery tickets, or similarly specific things growing from their appendages, sometimes even capable of independent speech and movement. In some cases, this may be justified by giving the monster the ability to determine what its prospective targets most value and mould its lure accordingly, or else to have evolved alongside intelligent beings for long enough to have developed some very specific hunting adaptations.

Another common angle is for these beasts to have some form of psychic powers or otherwise supernatural ability to compel behavior in others. This may be used to enhance a physical bait, such as by using a Glamour to make it look more compelling, or else to directly place a strong compulsion in a victim's mind. In a similarly supernatural manner, a Voice Changeling might imitate someone's voice to lure in unsuspecting victims, especially if the voice belongs to someone the victim knows.

Subtropes include:

-   Alluring Flowers: These often use extremely attractive, sometimes supernaturally so, scents to draw in unsuspecting victims.
-   Chest Monster: Creature that disguise themselves as valuable loot in order to eat unwary treasure-hunters.
-   Literal Maneater: A female character who is The Vamp or a Femme Fatale and uses her good looks to attract men to eat.
-   Siren Song: Supernatural beings that use their beautiful voices to draw people to their doom.
-   Will-o'-the-Wisp: Floating lights that lure travelers into dangerous situations, often to feed on them in some manner.

Compare Compelling Voice; Decoy Damsel, where a character pretends to be helpless or in distress; and Wounded Gazelle Gambit, where one pretends to be a victim to manipulate others.

Although Kaede's willing to cook Soichiro, she disapproves of it because they could be run out of town. However, Momiji clarifies that she actually lured Soichiro into their house because she likes him, and when Soichiro innocently says he likes her too, Kaede says she's happy to hear that because oni tradition states that when an oni falls in love with a human, that human is to be abducted and forced into marriage. Socihiro tries to resist, but eventually relents and gets married to Momiji, and soon after that, he takes Kaede as a wife as well.

You just stand there looking cute.  
And when something moves—you shoot!"_

    Tabletop Games

    -   Lantern sea serpents have anglerfish-like lures on their heads, which they use to produce the _hypnotic pattern_ that lets them incapacitate prey.
    -   A magran is a monster resembling a legless reptile native to the Ethereal Plane, with a glowing lure on a stalk like an anglerfish's. Its light is visible farther than it has any right to be in ethereal fog, and creatures that see it are entranced and thus become easy morsels; the critter itself can also turn invisible at will. What's fun is that this glowing lure can be harvested from a slain magran, and can be used to replicate a _hypnotic pattern_ effect for a few weeks after the creature's death, with the caveat that it affects _everyone_ around it, and the lure's wielder might grow obsessed with it, refusing to part with the thing.
    -   The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing looks like a small fluffy rabbit-like creature, but that is only its lure. The monster's real body is disguised as a tree stump and lies in wait for prey that mistakes its lure for a potential friend or easy meal.

-   _Pathfinder_:
    -   Ceratioidi are humanoid anglerfish. They can use the lure growing from their heads to mesmerize other creatures.

-   _Warhammer Fantasy_:
    -   Orb Leviathans, introduced in _Dreadfleet_ and expanded upon in _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_ 4th ed., are whale-sized anglerfish with green lures. Slow and ungainly swimmers by nature, they hunt by waving their lures back and forth in front of their gaping mouths to lure prey into easy swallowing range. Their _Lure of the Leviathan_ rule in _Fantasy Roleplay_ allows them to stun anybody who looks at the glow of their lure passing by underwater.
    -   _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_: Lurkerfish are anglerfish-like fish that live in shallow fresh and brackish water.

    -   Chinchou and its evolution Lanturn are anglerfish-like Pokémon with dorsal fins modified into glowing lures; Chinchou is mostly described as using its lures to communicate or produce electric attacks, but Lanturn is stated by the Pokédex to use its escas to lure prey and blind it before eating it. They also have the "Illuminate" ability, which doubles the likelihood of meeting wild Pokémon if they're in the first spot in your party.
    -   Morelull and Shiinotic are mushroom-like 'mons that release clouds of glowing spores with which to lure in other creatures and send them into a deep sleep, after which the fungus drains their life energy. They can also have the "Illuminate" ability.

-   _Splatoon_: In the Salmon Run mode, players can lure enemy bosses toward a basket so that, upon slaying said bosses, the eggs they drop can be quickly harvested (picked up and put into the basket). This does not always work, but works often enough to be one of the keys to getting the highest scores. The community calls this "luring".
-   _Subnautica_: The Mesmer is a species of fish that has tiny lenses on its fins, which it can angle to create mesmerising patterns that flood its prey's mind with enticing messages, drawing them towards it so it can eat them. If the player looks at one, they will hear it speaking to them in the voice of the PDA:
    
    "It is your primary directive to swim closer to that beautiful creature... Swim closer... Swim closer now... It looks so friendly... Do not resist... Don't struggle... Go closer"
    
    -   In _Subnautica: Below Zero_, the Shadow Leviathan's maw glows faintly blue, and its PDA description posits that this glow mimics that of bioluminescent plankton, the better to attract filter-feeding prey.
-   _Sunless Sea_: One random event while out on the Unterzee has your ship encounter an elegant lady waving and sighing from a rock out at sea.

    Web Original 

-   _Codex Inversus_: The female enchanting mantis hunts by using her forelegs to trace magical reactive glyphs in the air that cause other insects to be drawn towards them. Simple proximity to the incantation will only cause a target to subconsciously head in the mantis' direction, while seeing the incantation directly will compel prey to heads towards her and meekly await consumption. An abrupt stopping of the incantation will cause an opposite effect, which the mantises use to make larger creatures flinch away from them and give the insect an extra moment to escape.

-   _Malevolent_: In Episode 15, while in the Dreamlands, Arthur and The Entity/John find a map and decide to walk in the direction of a mysterious looking flower bulb. Once they get there, they find themselves standing in a pool of mysterious moss and Arthur hears a soothing voice and finds himself unable to move. As he stands there, John tries to snap him out of it, and the moss starts chewing on his pant legs. In the next episode, Arthur is able to snap out of it and they discover human remains stripped of flesh beneath the moss, implying that not only does the moss seem to use its influence to lure and trap its prey, but that Arthur is not the first human to find themselves trapped here.
-   "The Ocean's Cool Air" features a man stranded at sea in a lifeboat. When a ship sails by and spots the craft, the crew moves to rescue him—and that's when a _massive_ sea monster destroys the larger ship and devours all the sailors.

    Real Life 

-   Alligator snapping turtles hunt by lying still underwater, using their rough, often algae-covered scales and shells to hide within weedy, murky waters while extending their long, wormlike tongues and flicking them around in the water. Eventually, a fish or crustacean comes to investigate what seems like a tasty morsel floating about by itself, walks into the turtle's open beak, and is promptly eaten.
-   Anglerfish hunt using the highly extended, modified front spines of their dorsal fins, which end in small lures. In shallow-water species such as monkfish and frogfish, these are shaped like worms or bits of meat and flicked back and forth in front of the fish's mouth, while the rest of the body is drably colored or otherwise camouflaged. In deep-sea species such as footballfish, the lure instead glows to lure smaller animals into investigating it while the body is black to hide in the pitch darkness.
-   The Australian death adder has a small orange lure on the end of its tail that it wriggles to imitate a beetle larva in order to trick hungry lizards into coming after it.
-   Bolas spiders prey on moths by capturing them with strands of silk tipped with drops of glue and spun like flails. To hunt, the spiders find a twig with a good vantage point and produce a scent similar to that of female moths in heat, which draws male moths towards them and into lassoing range.
-   Since carnivorous plants can't really move, this is the only real way that they can find prey. Their traps have colourful markings and secrete sweet-smelling nectar to attract insects and other small animals.
-   Some female fireflies can copy the light patterns of other species and use this in order to lure in males for them to kill and eat.
-   The margay (a small jungle cat related to the ocelot) has been known to mimic the calls of a baby tamarin (a type of small South American monkey) in distress in order to lure an adult. There are also anecdotal reports of other cat species, like jaguars, tigers, and cougars, doing something similar.
-   _Portia_ jumping spiders hunt other spiders and are very successful at it. One of their methods for attacking web-building spiders is to tap the web in a manner that imitates a trapped insect, or the vibrations of a male attempting to attract a female, in order to lure the web's owner close.
-   Spider-tailed horned vipers have horny tail tips with projecting spines that loosely resemble an arthropod. When hunting, the snake flicks and wiggles its tail tip to imitate a small crawling insect or spider, luring insect-eating creatures within biting range.
-   The green heron will often use bits of debris or food to lure fish to the surface. This behavior has been observed in other birds as well, but the green heron is especially well-known for it due to the use of lures being its primary hunting method.
-   American alligators normally _don't_ hunt in this manner, but they make an exception for nesting birds - they'll occasionally balance sticks on their snouts to bait in birds that would otherwise be too difficult to catch. This is one of the few instances of predatory animals being documented using tools to aid them in hunting.
