_"It's the classic Victorian love story scene — a couple lounging in a rowboat, on a lazy summer afternoon in the middle of the lake, while he woos her with poetry by Byron or Keats."_

A lady and her suitor are having a romantic date on a rowboat, perhaps a swan boat. This was a popular dating image for the 19th and early 20th century upper classes, as it provided a chance for couples to be alone together, but still in plain sight to avoid accusations of anything sexual happening.

The typical image is the lady sitting under her Parasol of Prettiness in a Simple, yet Opulent dress<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> , while the gentleman sits on the other side, wooing her in various ways. Bonus points if he's using a ukulele.

These days, "old-fashioned" means precisely that. This isn't quite a Dead Horse Trope, but spoofs of it far outnumber straight uses these days, usually with at least one of the participants falling into the water if the boat doesn't sink. Also, the "Tunnel of Love" rides in amusement parks were sort of a play on this trope, using the dark to allow couples to have intimate contact with nobody actually seeing anything. Another popular variation is a date in a Venetian gondola (with the bonus that you can pay someone else to do the actual rowing).

A Sister Trope to Serenade Your Lover, Courtly Love (another romance ideal), Married at Sea (taking this to another level).

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the OVA version of _Ah! My Goddess_, while going off to the beach together Keiichi and Belldandy decide to go and have a little moment alone in an inflatable boat.

-   _Campione!_: During the Beach Episode Erica forces Godou into having one of these, though she clearly intends for it to go a little further, given that she even handcuffed him. As soon as she removes the cuffs, he jumps overboard and swims to get away from her.

-   Played with in _Great Teacher Onizuka_. Onizuka plays hooky to take a stressed out Fuyutsuki rowing, but he claims he does this all the time by himself when he's feeling stressed. And then the boat turns out to be leaky. He also takes Murai's mom on a boat date. It doesn't leak that time, but the date's still ruined, this time by having to rescue Murai, who jumped in the water to stop the date, despite not being able to swim.

It hilariously backfires since Kotoko starts panicking and they both fall into the water.
-   In _Love Hina_, Keitaro takes Mutsumi on one, though not with the intention of taking her on a date (he had originally meant to use it to talk to her in private, but instead realized it looked more like they were on a date).
-   _My Monster Secret_: One chapter has Asahi and Youko going to an amusement park where this is one of the activities they did, under the suggestion of their friend Karen. She was hoping to re-create a date Youko's parents had, where riding in the boat made her father Genjirou "jump up and sing" with joy...but in reality, he was freaking out because they were on open water. Thankfully, Youko is only half-vampire so it doesn't bug her quite as much.
-   In _Octave_, Yukino and Setsuko go on one. Since they're both girls, they janken to decide who rows.
-   _The Quintessential Quintuplets_ has one during the Seven Goodbyes arc. Fuutarou meets one of the quintuplets in disguise, claiming to be the girl she met give years in Kyoto under the alias "Rena", and the two have a moment in a boat on a lake.

The ending reveals that the goal was not romantic but that he was with the superintendent's secretary and asked her for an extra school monitor.
-   An ostensibly platonic version happens between Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, with Bruce rowing Dick around. Of course, the platonic aspect is questionable; this was the same era in which Dick and Bruce sunbathed nude together and slept in the same bed.

    Fan Works 

    Films — Animation 

-   Invoked in _The Little Mermaid_ as part of the song "Kiss the Girl."
-   A date in _Tangled_ didn't start out this way, but ended up being so. Flynn took Rapunzel on a boat to see the lanterns she had always wanted to see, and their talk in this moment turned it into a date. Also in the song "I've Got a Dream" the Big Nose Thug references this trope.

-   Two couples have a date on a row-boat in _Bridget Jones' Diary_ at the same time. They know each other but are not really on friendly terms. Mark and Natasha are dignified and discuss their case as they are both lawyers. Bridget and Daniel have more fun. She recites John Keats' poem "To the Autumn" (Daniel specifically _forbade_ Keats), and he tries to outshout her with a dirty limerick. He then parodies the iconic "I-am-King-of-the-World" scene from _Titanic (1997)_, and unsurprisingly falls into water. He doesn't want to be the only one wet and tries to swing the boat with Bridget as well. Prim and proper Natasha is horrified ("How childish!"), but Mark looks as if he envied them.

-   Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane go punting in _Gaudy Night_, and the scene is retained in the 1987 BBC television production.

-   "De Lunatico", a poem from George A. Baker's 19th-century _Point Lace and Diamonds_, subverts the trope by applying it to an elderly couple:
    
    You're no more a maiden fair, and I no lover, young and glowing;
    
    Just an old, sober, married pair, who, after tea, have gone out rowing.
    
-   _Sherlock Holmes_: "The Cardboard Box" plays it for drama as the young couple were an adulterous pair, murdered by the jealous husband. The murderer himself is not without sympathy, as it turns out the wife had been persuaded to find a lover by the machinations of her sister, who'd tried to seduce the husband and took his scorn badly.
-   _An American Tragedy_ both plays this straight and subverts it: a romantic date with a girl playing her mandolin and a date with another girl that ends very badly.

        -   Straight out of the Theodore Dreiser novel _An American Tragedy_.
    -   The television episode "Blind Date" ends far more romantically. Their spat ended, Mr. Boynton invites Miss Brooks to spend the evening out on the lake as he serenades her with his ukulele.

-   _Person of Interest_. In "Lady Killer", Reese and Shaw pretend to go on one as an excuse to scope out their new number, who's a professional gigolo. Shaw isn't the least bit happy that she's not allowed to row (as that would be suspicious), but given that Reese is a Launcher of a Thousand Ships, it's safe to say that several shippers were quite pleased.
-   _Psych_ has a subversion when Shawn, who's dating Juliette at the time, infiltrates the set of "Paths of Love" (a "Bachelor-esque" dating show) to solve a series of sabotages that have resulted in injuries.
