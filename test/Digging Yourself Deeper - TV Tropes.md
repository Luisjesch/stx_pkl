_"If you ever find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop diggin'."_

In a Sitcom, often a character will say something that's just meant to be a friendly little remark, and it will come out wrong, possibly sounding creepy, crazy, or offensive; they'll try and clarify it (whether they really need to or not), but just make things worse, and dig themselves deeper and deeper into the creepy/crazy/offensive pit. This may eventually lead to the character deciding to stop talking, though not always. Exceptionally deep and/or frequent excavations are commonplace in Cringe Comedies.

This is most commonly seen in comedy works, but is just as often Played for Drama - a common example is someone being caught in a situation that makes them _look_ guilty (see The Corpse Stops Here), trying to explain that they're in fact innocent, and not only failing to convince the other party but in fact making themselves appear even more culpable.

Compare That Came Out Wrong, Freudian Slippery Slope, Did I Just Say That Out Loud?, Open Mouth, Insert Foot, Verbal Backpedaling. The comedic verbal version of From Bad to Worse.

Contrast Change the Uncomfortable Subject and Not Helping Your Case (although it can overlap with Digging Yourself Deeper).

Subjecting a character to this too often may eventually lead to a (usually) comedic version of Then Let Me Be Evil.

Not to be confused Dug Too Deep (which is about physical digging), or Digging to China (same). Nor Dig Your Own Grave, for that matter.

-   The third Blue Beetle stumbles into this when he teams up with Batman in _The Brave and the Bold_ (revived series issue #3).
    
    **Beetle:** My armor should be able to track the watchamatrix's energy sig, but the tracking's all kaflooey. Probability-alteration factor, maybe?...I'm sorry! I'm not making excuses. I swear! I know you hate excuses! I'm trying, I promise! I just-  
    **Batman:** Jaime... Relax.  
    **Beetle:** ...Ohmygodyou'renotreallyBatman... OhgodIsaidthatoutloud...  
    **Batman:** Jaime...  
    **Beetle:** _What?_ Don't kill me.
    
-   Used as a visual metaphor in the furry comic _ISO_, when Cody has to swiftly make up lies about his supposed girlfriend to keep his parents from finding out about Doug, as well as the fact he's on the outs with Todd and has a roommate he can't stand.
-   Rocky (from the Swedish comic, not the boxer) once gets into this when meeting his current girlfriend's father. He wants to compliment him on his house, but makes a Freudian Slip and substitutes "dick" for "house", and then it gets worse. The girlfriend's father shuts him up with the wonderful comeback: "Kid, if you've put your foot in your mouth, at least have the sense to stand still!"
-   The tie-in comic for _Star Trek: Elite Force_ involves Beissman responding enthusiastically to the assignment of watching Seven's back. She handles it in her usual manner.
    
    **Seven:** That hole you're digging is getting deeper.
    
-   A _stunningly awkward_ moment for Nurse Annie in issue #421 of _Uncanny X-Men_, doubling as a bit of a Freudian Slippery Slope.
    
    **Alex:** So my brother tells me I have you to thank for keeping me clean and odor-free while I was a vegetable, Annie.  
    **Annie:** Well... It was my job.  
    **Alex:** It's still pretty special to me. If a little awkward, given what you probably had to do.  
    **Annie:** It was my pleasure. Really. I mean—not like I get pleasure out of—I mean—I had to keep you clean—It's just part of the, the, the—  
    **Paige:** I'm surprised she can talk with that much foot in her mouth.  
    **Alex:** Yeah, I thought _I'd_ be the embarrassed one. I mean, I was the one naked during the procedure.  
    **Annie:** Well, yeah, but if I could have been the naked one, I would've been—I mean, not the naked one, that's not what I meant, I meant the one without clothes on—and you'd be naked—I mean, the one with clothes on and you'd be rubbing me naked—_cleaning_, not rubbing, cleaning, you know, sponging, in a medical way—  
    **Paige:** I think she's going to explode.
    
-   _Wonder Woman" The Contest_: Mala doesn't think before talking to Diana about how excieted the Amazons are for another contest to choose Wonder Woman, even though this means replacing Diana;
    
    **Mala:** Why we were all saying that this is the _best_ thing that could possibly happen…_umm_, well not _the best_, of course. I mean, no one meant _that_. You've done a…very nice job as Wonder Woman…better than nice, an _excellent_ job… I mean, even leveling Boston was only a fluke. Perfectly understandable. And we weren't actually happy so much as-

    **Garfield:** And the hole gets deeper.
    
-   Chad from 'Patty's Perps' in _Knights of the Dinner Table_ is a master of this.
    
    **Chad**: Awwwwh, c'mon Patty! When I said girl gamers were lame I wasn't referring to you! You're just like one of the guys.  
    **Patty**: Like one of the guys? Your character suddenly hears a rustling in the underbrush. Roll for initiative.  
    **Tank**: Careful, Chad. You're digging that hole deeper and deeper.
    
-   In one series of _Zits_ strips, when Jeremy inquires Sarah about how she's gotten a tan, he ends up telling her "Your freckles help camouflage your zits," with the comment literally hanging in the air afterwards. Jeremy desperately begs to change the subject, only to then ask Sarah "What's it like having divorced parents?" Needless to say, Sarah is not amused, and Jeremy is left smacking himself in the face with a Nerf bat.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Buster & Chauncey's Silent Night_: After being framed for the theft of the church's riches, Christine tries to prove her innocence by bringing a police officer a piece of the stolen goods. All she ends up doing is confirming her guilt in his eyes.
-   Sally in _Cars_: "I thought I'd say thank you for doing a great job, so I thought I'd let you stay with me. I mean not with me, but there. Not with me there, but there in your own cozy cone, and I'd be in my cone..."

-   Referenced in _Incredibles 2_. After Bob gets berated by the police for the additional damages caused by their attempted heroics at beginning of the movie, Agent Dicker stands up from the corner.
    
    **Dicker**: You wanna get out of the hole? First you gotta put down the shovel.
    
-   Dracula in _Hotel Transylvania_, after getting rid of the human Jonathan (whom he has disguised, for the monsters' benefit, as a third cousin of Frankenstein's right hand), is relaxing with his monster friends in a sauna. He mentions that he really wouldn't want his Cute Monster Girl daughter to end up with Jonathan's "kind". Cue Frank getting upset. Dracula tries to explain himself and points to Jonathan's red, curly hair. Cue Griffin The Invisible Man getting annoyed, only for Dracula to lampshade that he couldn't have possibly known what Griffin's hair looks like. After a cut, we see other monsters getting annoyed.

-   _The Princess and the Frog_: Naveen is trying to _propose_ to Tiana in the end, and manages to make Tiana look annoyed a few times doing so. Tiana did admit that she thought the fumbling around was cute.
    
    **Naveen:** You have had quite an influence on me, which is amazing because I have dated _thousands_ of women and— _\[Tiana looks annoyed\]_ ...uh, no, like, two, three— er, just other women! And anyway, listen, you could not be more different, you know, you are— you are practically, aheh, one of the guys! _\[Tiana looks affronted\]_ _Nonono_, you are not a guy! Let me begin again. Uh—" _\[Naveen stumbles and falls to the floor along with the food\]_ I... am not myself tonight.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Avengers: Endgame_ has several examples:
    -   After Tony Stark's daughter Morgan accidentally learns the word "shit" from him, he tells her not to swear, and then says "'Cause I got shit to do!". Cue her continuing to repeat the word...
    -   When Scott Lang is trying to explain his idea for undoing the Snap to Steve Rogers and Natasha, he tries hard to avoid using the words "time travel" or "time machine," but slowly realizes how absurd that sounds and admits that yeah, he's talking about a time machine.
    -   Subverted when the three of them are trying to explain Scott's idea to Tony Stark. Tony reacts to Scott's reference to "the rules of time travel" by asking if the entire idea came from watching _Back to the Future_. To his credit, Scott doesn't try to deny it.
-   _Bean_: Subverted when Mr. Bean is forced to give an improvised speech on the Whistler's Mother painting. After fumbling for a bit, he handles the speech quite well, although it lacks any meaningful content. General Newton and much of the audience just appreciate Bean's straightforward remarks on The Power of Family. The characters who might have been offended take it as dryly comical ribbing at their earlier request not to have a boring lecture of art history, and maybe insert a joke or two into the speech, since they assumed Bean to be a stereotypical British academic.
-   Wallace's conversations in _The F Word_ almost universally fall under this trope. Fortunately, Chantry, his love interest, keeps up with him line after line, both digging themselves deeper.
-   Done rather drolly in _The Great New Wonderful_. Pastry chef Emme, along with her assistants, is presenting a line of birthday cakes to a wealthy Park Avenue girl. The girl expresses interest in one cake, commenting on how beautiful it is. One of Emme's assistants, Justin, then chimes in with "And it's easy on the hips." Another assistant hastily bails him out by explaining that the cake is a low-density one that doesn't require a lot of processed sugar to hold it up. When he's done, Justin says "That just basically means it's less fattening."
-   Jim Carrey's character in _Liar Liar_, cursed so that he Cannot Tell a Lie, boards an elevator with a well-endowed woman. The first words out of his mouth are about her breasts. As he tries to cover himself, more and more lines about her rack spill out... Gilligan Cut to him leaving the elevator, having gotten well-slapped.
    
    **Woman**: Everyone in the building has been so nice to me.  
    **Jim**: Well, that's because you've got big jugs! I mean, your boobs are huge. I mean, I want to squeeze them. I mean...
    
-   Kat, in _Love at the Christmas Table_, manages somehow to go from that there are romantic prospects in her life to describing how there are guys lined up one after another, ready to land... and then she admits that she's digging herself deeper.
-   Happens to Cady repeatedly in _Mean Girls_. She refers to the phenomenon as 'word vomit'.
-   More minor, yet still socially awkward occasions happen to Mr. Bingley in _Pride & Prejudice (2005)_.
    
    "It's a pleasure. I mean, it's not a pleasure that she's ill. Of course not. It's a pleasure that she's here, being ill. Um..."  
    "I'm not a good reader. I prefer being out of doors. Oh, I mean, I can read, of course. And I'm not suggesting you can't read out of doors..."
    
-   _My Cousin Vinny_: The plot is the result of Vinny's cousin Billy and his friend Stanley being charged with murder. How did they get a murder charge? They didn't even _know_ what they were arrested for, and kept answering questions thinking they were being charged with stealing some groceries they forgot to pay for. In fact, this is Truth in Television for many people convicted of a crime because of statements made to the police, because many of the things you say, no matter how innocuous, can lead to a conviction. It's taken up to eleven when one of them says "I shot the clerk?" as a question, but it sounds like a statement.
-   Norman Bates from _Psycho_ does this with absurd regularity.
    
    **Norman**: You eat like a bird, haha.  
    **Marion**: You'd know, of course.  
    **Norman**: You know, I hear the phrase 'eats like a bird' is actually a fa - fals - f - fa - falsity because birds really eat a tremendous lot.  
    _(Beat)_  
    **Norman**: ...I really don't know anything about birds.
    
-   In _Schtonk!_ (about the faked Hitler diaries), with a journalist meeting Freya von Hepp, Göring's niece.
    
    Nice to meet you, Frau Göring!  
    _Von Hepp._  
    Oh, I'm sorry.  
    You don't have to, I am not ashamed of my uncle.  
    Neither am I, my uncle was active in the resistance!  
    ''(She stays silent.)  
    Maybe... the two of them sometimes have met then...
    
-   Done in _Severance (2006)_ with a great jab at the end:
    
    **Richard**: Hi Maggie. Not eating?  
    **Maggie**: Why are you all so obsessed with what I eat? I am not too skinny.  
    **Richard**: No, no, no, no. I don't mean... Just that you'll need your energy for the team games. I mean, you're perfect just the way you are. And when I say perfect, I obviously don't mean that in a sexual way. I mean perfect in a neutral way. As if I were another woman saying that you were perfect, you know? Just one woman to another. Not that I'm implying anything like that. Or that there's anything wrong with that... sort of thing. Or... anything.  
    **Steve**: Keep digging, we can still see you.
    
-   Spock finds himself in this position in _Star Trek Beyond_ when he explains to Kirk and McCoy how they can locate the rest of the crew by homing in on a rare radioactive isotope. Specifically, the necklace that had belonged to Spock's mother, and that he later gave to Uhura as a gift.
    
    **McCoy**: You gave your girlfriend radioactive jewelry?  
    **Spock**: The emission is harmless, however, its unique signature makes it very easy to identify.  
    **McCoy**: You gave your girlfriend a _tracking device_.  
    \[Beat\]  
    **Spock**: ...That was not my intention.
    
-   _Tommy Boy_: Tommy tries to smooth-talk a client with one of his father's favorite sayings, however, he screws it up terribly.

    Literature 

-   In the chick-lit/mystery novels _Bad Kitty_ and _Kitty Kitty_, the main character Jasmine Callihan has this problem a _lot_. She blames it all on the monkeys that live in her head. For instance, when she is trying to leave a message on her boyfriend's cell phone, while she is convinced he is cheating on her, Hilarity Ensues:
    
    "Hi, Jack, it's me. Jas. Jasmine. I'm sorry I missed you on IM yesterday but I got arrested for murder. I mean, I didn't do it, but I accidentally told the police I did, so it was confusing. Now we're going for dinner at The House That Kills, but that is only a nickname because a lot of people have died there, but it's completely safe. Anyway, I hope you're having a very nice morning and not melting in anyone's mouth or hands - Sorry, I meant molting. On anyone. Ha ha. Because molting is bad. Unless you're a wee creature of the forest, but - um, never mind, I've got to go, bye."
    
-   In the _The Belgariad_ / _The Malloreon_ by David Eddings, several characters fall for this, usually cut short by another character suggesting "Why don't you just stop talking now." or "What a fascinating observation, why don't we pursue that line of thought." or similar.
-   _Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul_: Rodrick wins the "I Must Confess" game by revealing that Löded Diper trashed Mrs. Tuttle's house for calling the police because they were playing too loud. Susan is clearly angry and confronts Rodrick about it, but the latter, instead of trying to find a way to bail himself out, cheerfully tells her "there were four of \[them\]!". Cue Susan making Frank pull over and forcing an apology to Mrs. Tuttle out of Rodrick.
-   _Discworld_: During a talk with Vetinari in _Making Money_, Moist von Lipwig seems unable to put the metaphorical shovel down. The funniest point is probably that Vetinari didn't even ask about the problem, Moist just assumed that this was the reason why his boss wanted to talk to him.
    
    **Moist:** Look, I can explain.  
    **Lord Vetinari:** Pray do.  
    **Moist:** We got a bit carried away. We were a bit too creative in our thinking. We encouraged mongooses to breed in the posting boxes to keep down the snakes…  
    **Lord Vetinari:** (_silence_)  
    **Moist:** Er…which, admittedly, we introduced into the letter boxes to reduce the numbers of toads…  
    **Lord Vetinari:** (_repeats himself_)  
    **Moist:** Er…which, it's true, staff put in the posting boxes to keep down the snails…  
    **Lord Vetinari:** (_remains unvocal_)  
    **Moist:** Er…These, I must in fairness point out, got into the boxes of their own accord, in order to eat the glue on the stamps.  
    **Lord Vetinari:** Well, at least you were saved the trouble of having to introduce them yourselves.
    
-   In the _Gaunt's Ghosts_ novel _Blood Pact_, Gaunt tricks Ayatani Zweil into going for his medical by making the latter condemn the person who hadn't gone for medicals until he realises that he's talking about himself.
-   Chloe William's comment to her husband Buck when he tries to explain the reason he calls a car by a girl's name in the _Left Behind_ book _The Mark_.
-   In _The Magician King_, Quentin is outraged at the primitive learning conditions in the safe house for hedge-wizards and insists that his friend Julia doesn't belong there, insisting that she can't have learned magic from "unlicensed losers"... only for Julia to take offence, for - as Quentin full knows - she's a hedge-witch who had to learn unofficially after Brakebills turned her down and Quentin refused to help her get in. Flustered, Quentin tries to point out that it's a wonder that nobody's burned down the safe house, but Julia simply points out that he's not angry about the safety standards but about how the hedge-witches aren't good enough by his standards. In a desperate attempt to mollify Julia, Quentin changes tack and points out that he earned the right to perform magic in his years at Brakebills, claiming that the residents of the safe house picked it up at the 7-11; Julia, who had to endure several painful years of depression and obsessive study just to succeed as a hedge-witch, even going so far as to trade sex for magic knowledge, is _not_ amused.
-   A scene in Robert Asprin's _Myth-ing Persons_ has Guido doing this to himself with his employer Skeeve; he only belatedly informs Skeeve that they're being followed, and then tries to defend himself by saying that the follower is so obvious that any idiot could tell they were there. Fellow employee Massha cheerfully invokes this trope.
-   _Ravirn_: Ravirn has a tendency towards this, which Melchior lampshades in _WebMage_:
    
    **Melchior**: Judging from past experience and what little I've heard, I'm thinking you're following the pattern where you start out in a lot of trouble, and then through a series of brilliantly chosen words, make it infinitely worse.
    

    Music 

-   The Jason Robert Brown song, "I Could Be In Love With Someone Like You" starts out like this, although the singer recovers admirably by the end of the song:
    
    My first crush on an Irish girl...  
    I was ten years old, and her name was Elaine.  
    Little red-haired girl;  
    Well, she looked like you,  
    But if you were ten,  
    Which you're clearly not.  
    Not that you look old, but you get my—  
    I'll just stop now.
    

    Radio 

-   _Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge_: Alan Partridge often backtracked with "Not literally; that would be hideous."
-   In an episode of _The News Quiz_ a discussion of the Channel Tunnel (sponsored by Scottish Widows Insurance) moved on to the woman in the Scottish Widows adverts, who Bob Mills thought was Sean Connery's daughter.
    
    **Susan Calman**: Roger Moore's daughter.  
    **Bob Mills**: Roger Moore's daughter, of course. Because Sean Connery's daughter would be a hideous gnarled creature, wouldn't she? She was Roger Moore's daughter... No... No! I hope Sean Connery hasn't got a daughter because now I've just... Well, I hope he has, I hope...  
    **Greg Proops**: You were talking about digging a tunnel before...
    
-   NPR's _Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me_ lampshades this with a bit of Self-Deprecation in a clip-show where host Peter Sagal quips, "When we find ourselves in a hole, we break out the steam-shovel and set course for the center of the earth."
-   In _Were You Raised by Wolves?_ a lot of Nick's and Leah's advice focuses on how to avoid this after the fact or how to get out of whatever hole listeners have dug for themselves.

    Roleplay 

-   Played for Drama in _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_. Mirielle is carrying a box of cookies into school when she trips up and spills them everywhere. Emmanuel comes across them and starts scoffing them up, because he now has Super-Speed and using it leaves him starving. His mother then arrives and Mirielle, who's distraught at him for taking her cookies, explains to her what Emmanuel is doing. Emmanuel then receives a horrible verbal lashing from his mother for over-eating, which makes Mirielle feel terrible. She tries to get him out of it by saying that he's probably just stressed from the previous night... except that just leads his mother to attack him more for keeping information from her, which is bad enough that Emmanuel starts to cry. Mirielle finally gives up on trying to explain things and instead drags them both away, saying they need to get to class.

    Theatre 

-   _Cyrano de Bergerac_: Act IV, Scene IV gives us this gem: After De Guiche informs the cadets the Last Stand, Cyrano offers Christian the goodbye letter he has prepared for Roxane, whom Cyrano has implied he does not love. Christian sees a spot in the letter and asks Cyrano why he has wept a tear on the letter:

-   _Bioware_ must love these, because Merrill does this all the time in _Dragon Age II_, and she knows it.
    
    **Merrill**: "... and I'm rambling again, aren't I?"
    
-   _Knights of the Old Republic_'s Bastila has one or two Freudian slips that result in similar conversations with a male player. One of those conversation paths contains one of the funniest lines of the whole game: when Bastila is trying to clarify what she meant by 'feelings for' the player, a possible response is "You're cute when you're embarrassed."
-   James Tobin has this happen to him in the game _In the 1st Degree_. He changes his story of what happened between him and Zack more than once. He admits to shooting himself in the leg because he was afraid no one would believe him when he said that Zack was shot in self-defense. If you play the game right, you get to watch as the prosecutor Granger pins Tobin on the leg-shooting thing. Granger asks if Tobin's first thought was to protect himself as his own business partner was lying there at his feet bleeding to death. Tobin responds by saying no, and that he tried to give Zack CPR. Granger says "You tried giving CPR to a man who was bleeding from the throat?" Tobin then gives a "Yes! I mean...No!" Yep, Tobin is _so_ experiencing this trope.
-   Shortly after you meet Liara in _Mass Effect_, she tells you she finds you fascinating because of your encounter with the Prothean beacon on Eden Prime. You can tease her about how clinical her interest sounds ("Sounds like you want to dissect me in a lab"), prompting her flustered response, "I only meant that you would be an interesting specimen for an in-depth study. No, that's even worse!"
    -   Tali gets similarly flustered in the sequel.
    -   Garrus has his moments, especially in the _Citadel_ DLC with MShep or non-romanced FemShep where he tries to hit on a female turian and ended up calling her an alcoholic or implying that he's a serial killer depending on which path Shepard led him on.
-   In _Portal 2_, Wheatley tells Chell that he hates having to look after all the 'smelly humans' and then blusters about it.
-   Defied in _Red Dead Redemption_. When talking to his wife about Bonnie, who saved his life, John Marston quickly notices her jealousy, and wisely stops digging and starts giving her compliments.
    
    **John**: When you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging.
    
-   In one skit in _Tales of Symphonia_, Colette asks Lloyd if he prefers her or girls like Princess Hilda. He digs himself in by saying that he likes girls like the Princess, but jumps back out by saying that he thinks Colette is cuter. Then he hops right back in and comments on how he's surrounded by pretty girls like Sheena, and was once part of Professor Raine's Fan Club. Colette angrily leaves, commenting on how Lloyd is just like Zelos, leaving both Lloyd and Zelos to wonder what exactly that's supposed to mean.
-   Happens in _Valkyrie Profile_ when unscrupulous mercenary Badrach dies and Lenneth Valkyrie appears before him. He at first thinks this means that, since a valkyrie has appeared before him, he gets to go to Valhalla. Lenneth bluntly informs him that no, she's just here to literally drag him to Hel (the Norse goddess) for his crimes in life. When Lenneth gives him the chance to come up with something redeeming, he remembers robbing and killing an old man, helping to kidnap someone, and spying on his own country. It's only at the last minute, when Badrach remembers literally one good deed (and even then, he did it mostly to get back at someone else) that Lenneth relents and takes his soul for Valhalla. Nor surprisingly, of the various einherjar that Lenneth recruits, Badrach starts with the second-lowest score for suitability for entry to Valhalla.

Finally, he gives up and declares that he'll be going on with Loli Loli Hunters on his own...right as Rin walks into the room. She proceeds to spend the entire rest of the scene glaring at him from across the room. Kyousuke is silent.

The situation only deteriorates from there.

Both times, all he managed to do was push the argument to Dan's, giving him the win.

    -   "Mother-in-law kept harassing me…": When Blair faked being hit by her daughter-in-law Ali with a ladle to accuse her of mistreatment to the latter's husband, he asks her why she has a ladle in her hand. When Blair replies she took it away from Ali in their scuffle, he tells her she's in the middle of washing the dishes.

-   _Sekai No Fushigi_: After a woman broke into Daisuke and Miyuki's wedding and revealed the latter had an affair with her husband, she tries to deny it to Daisuke. However, her poor choice of words when answering his questions only confirms it even further.
-   In the _Cilvanis_ video "When Your Friend Watches Sus Anime," a man tells his friend about "The Time I, as a 40-Year-Old, Fell in Love With a 12-Year-Old." What follows is the man trying to explain to his horrified friend how the concept isn't as bad as it sounds, from mentioning that the 40-year-old traveled back in time to his 12-year-old body, or claiming that the age of consent is different in the fantasy world, none of which make his friend feel any better.
-   The victims of Jayuzumi's pranks frequently fail to realise that they are being recorded and trolled, and thus their shouting at him to stop just makes him press their buttons more.
-   _Todd in the Shadows_ lands in this in his review of "Bang Bang" specifically talking about Ariana Grande's part, struggling to talk about the sexual nature of it without sounding like a creep. Lampshaded heavily through various screen pop-ups like "Breaking News: Todd in big trouble." and "Todd digging hole even deeper."
-   _Good Mythical Morning_: In this episode, Rhett makes a jab about community college, then tries to apologize, but cant help but continuously insert more jabs as he goes.

    **Rhett:** Let somebody bust your balls every once in a while, you know? Get your balls busted by the things that don't matter. (...) And you don't have to have balls to... I mean, this is not a man-woman thing, this is...
    
    **Link:** What do you think about women, Rhett?
    

    Real Life 

-   There's an old story about a German mayor who didn't want people to let their dogs run unleashed in the local forest, so he had put up a sign stating: "Anyone who'll let his dog run unleashed in the forest will be shot!" When someone remarked that this could be read as if the _owners_ of the dogs were shot, the mayor had it "improved" to: "Anyone who'll let his dog run unleashed in the forest will be shot, the dog!" ("Dog" being a somewhat outdated insult.)
-   The founder of the Papa John's restaurant company, John Schnatter, criticized black NFL players, who out of protest kneeled while the national anthem was played, for which he had to resign as CEO. In an effort to avoid any other racist controversy again, a media-training company was hired, but during a role-playing exercise conference call, he complained that KFC's Colonel Sanders used to call black people the N-word without being criticized for it, in the process actually using the slur instead of the T-Word Euphemism. He then had to resign as chairman of the board.
-   At the end of Blizzcon 2018, spokesman Wyatt Cheng announced there would be a new Diablo game called _Diablo Immortal_, but announced that it would be a mobile game. Those in attendance didn't like this one bit, with one person asking "Is this an out of season April Fools joke?" (which briefly made him a Memetic Badass among _Diablo_ fans). Another person asked if it would be available on PC, to which Cheng replied that it would not. A bunch of people in the audience started booing, to which Cheng replied with "do you guys not have phones?" Probably not the right thing to say to a crowd of people who've likely each spent a few thousand dollars on their gaming PC rigs. The resulting controversy was a black eye on the game and Blizzard Entertainment as a whole.
-   After Tina Turner's autobiography _I, Tina_ revealed that ex-husband Ike Turner was physically abusive, he responded by saying "Yeah I hit her, but no more than the average guy beats his wife." Then when the book was made into the film _What's Love Got to Do with It (1993)_, which destroyed his reputation once and for all, he responded saying "Sure, I've slapped Tina. We had fights and there have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I never beat her."
-   Mainland China under the CCP often accuse the USA of destabilizing peace... Except their aggressive expansionism throughout the South China/Sea of Asia and the territories surrounding India, and their desire to invade Taiwan rather than leave it alone only ensured that they are seen as bullying aggressors instead.
-   Three years after resigning in the wake of the Watergate scandal, which unearthed a long history of paranoid skullduggery, former US president Richard Nixon agreed to a series of interviews with English journalist David Frost in a bid to rehabilitate his public image. In the interviews' most infamous moment, Nixon responded to Frost's inquiries about the Huston Plan, an illegal proposition to spy on and terrorize political opponents, by bluntly and nonchalantly stating that "Well, when the president does it, that means that it is NOT illegal." Rather than redeem him in the eyes of the public, the interviews only emboldened the international consensus that Nixon was an unrepentant crook. The events were later dramatized in the play and film _Frost/Nixon_.

Shutting Up Now...

## TV's cake at stake jingle fail

As the new season is a disorganized mess without a real host anymore with actual administrative powers, TV tries coming up with a new jingle for cake at stake. Fries hated it, and TV made an even worse attempt after it. First, a sloppy rendition of the original song with a vocoded voice, then winged it with a more hideous vocoder setting and lazy color effects per syllable.

Example of:  
Dreadful Musician
