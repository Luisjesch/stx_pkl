And we'd like to compliment the good job your hairstylist did... that is, if you needed one!

_"Relax, Simpson. I just brought you in here for a friendly hello...  
...and goodbye! YOU'RE FIRED!  
But, wait. Perhaps I'm being too hasty. You are highly skilled...  
...AT GOOFING OFF!  
Now don't worry, Homer. You're the kind of guy I could really dig...  
...A GRAVE FOR!  
Your indolence is inefficacious!…  
…THAT MEANS YOU'RE TERRIBLE!"_

Someone seems at first to be saying one thing, but as they continue, they turn out to be saying something very different. Bonus points if what they turn out to be saying is the polar opposite of what they at first seemed to be saying.

One form of this is to start with an analogy that is typically used in favour of perspective X... only to go on to describe why it makes more sense to use this analogy against perspective X instead. Another common one is "This isn't good... this is great" or "I didn't like it... I loved it." The fancy rhetorical term for this is paraprosdokian. If the character really _was_ meaning to say the first thing, and then changed their mind, it's a Last-Second Word Swap or Verbal Backspace.

## Subtropes include:

-   Arson, Murder, and Lifesaving
-   Arson, Murder, and Admiration
-   Bait-and-Switch Sentiment
-   Beat Without a "But"
-   Berate and Switch
-   By "No", I Mean "Yes"
-   Chew-Out Fake-Out
-   Discriminate and Switch
-   I Have Just One Thing to Say
-   NOT!
-   The Not-So-Harmless Punishment
-   \[Popular Saying\], But...
-   Promotion, Not Punishment
-   Worse with Context

Comedic uses of this trope can often involve Comically Missing the Point and/or Skewed Priorities, with the audience and the listener expecting the speaker to say the sensible thing, only for them to say something that dashes those hopes.

Compare Distinction Without a Difference, Dramatic Pause. Compare/contrast Cue Card Pause, wherein the timing of a pause creates a similar effect. Compare and contrast Last-Second Word Swap, where someone originally intended to say one thing and decides in mid-sentence to say something else instead.

Not to be confused with Bait-and-Switch Comparison. One of them is a trope where the meaning of people's sentences changes as they keep talking... and the other is Bait And Switch Comparison! (No, it really is. What, you were expecting a joke?)

The dumbfounded look on Michele's face really sells it.

    -   A serious example happens in Chapter 27, when Seri takes the opportunity to speak with Shizuku despite the awkward tension between them. She says that she's always been scared of Shizuku, who bullied her in elementary school, and as much as she wants to forget it all, she can't. It seems as though nothing has changed since she rejected Shizuku's apology in Chapter 14... but then Ruri says that she wants to get to know Shizuku, since Shizuku has changed and getting to know the new her might help Ruri overcome her trauma.

    That followed it as gentle day,
    
    Doth follow night, who like a fiend
    
    From heaven to hell is flown away.
    
    "I hate," from hate away she threw,
    
    And saved my life, saying "not you."

-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_: When the crew's vehicle breaks down for a good, Mikkel points out it fortunately happened not that far away from their final destination, where a boat is supposed to pick them up. In fact, the destination is close enough that a lightly equipped person in good condition could get there in two days with ease. This also means that the crew members themselves will be able to make the trip in a week; they are expected to bring a large quantity of books back to their employers, are running out of food and at least one of them is ill by the time this happens.

    -   After Belkar has a conversation about his cooking skills with O-Chul and Lien, he tells Mr Scruffy. "That was so strange. I think that was the first conversation with a paladin I've ever had that wasn't dripping in judgement and hostility. And _they_ were nice, too!"

-   This is a not uncommon format for _Cracked_ article titles, such as "10 Awesome Ads (For Traumatizing Children)".
-   In one of his earliest reviews, _The Angry Video Game Nerd_ described the Power Glove (an infamous NES peripheral) as a potentially big step in innovative gaming... 'but too bad they were just FUCKING JERKING OFF!'
-   There are several Advice-Animal-style memes based around this, where the top line follows a stereotype of some sort and the bottom line changes the meaning. For instance, Successful Black Man ("I got Arrested... Development on DVD"), Ordinary Muslim Man ("We are going to blow up... a bouncy house for my daughter's birthday"), Almost-PC Redneck ("I fully support the right of my daughter to express her love for her girlfriend in public... It's pretty hot") or Dating Site Murderer ("I will slice you... a delicious piece of this Thanksgiving turkey").
    -   The world of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ memes has its own variation on this format, the 'Well-Intentioned Celestia'; in the top line, she appears to be the moon-banishment-happy tyrant she is so often memetically portrayed as, while the bottom lean reveals the perfectly innocuous thing she was trying to say ("Luna, I'm sending you to the moon... walking lessons; that's sure to make you more popular!") One example has her accidentally causing the infamous 'Cupcakes' fanfic in this manner: "Pinkie Pie, I want you to cut up Rainbow Dash... a slice of this delicious cake!"

    **Cooler**: Don't you DARE—  
    **Goku**: —you did on Earth.  
    **Cooler**: Oh. Fair enou—  
    **Vegeta**: And just like Freeza.  
    **Cooler:** _**GRAURHHAAAAAA**_
    
-   The They Had Us In The First Half meme consists of attaching this image to anything the poster considers to follow this trope.
-   Some Troll copypasta such as 5ever have the intended recipient of the comment tragically dying after the bait but before the switch. For example, a man tells a woman he no longer wants to be her boyfriend, leading to her death before he can clarify that he wants to be her _husband_.
-   _SF Debris_:
    -   Chuck said he had one complaint about Picard confronting Sarek in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, which was it made him want to see them have more scenes together.
    -   While reviewing "The Best of Both Worlds", Chuck compares Picard trying to deter the Borg by describing their new technologies (back when the Borg assimilated tech and not people) to trying to ward off a date rapist by telling him you're wearing crotchless panties.
        
        **Chuck:** You might call that a tasteless metaphor but _you'd be completely wrong!_ It's a simile.

-   In _Bronies React: The Season 5 Trailer_, AnimatedJames mentions that the setup of the tree, the chest, the castle and the map sounds like something straight out of a _The Legend of Zelda_ game. You're expecting him to mention _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_ (and in fact the logo of that game is briefly seen for a short while) but instead he mentions _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_.
-   In this parody of a dating website ad, which promises to get people together with a romantic partner, but makes no promises as to how healthy the relationship will be, the sales pitch is less than optimistic.

    -   Another example in "The Fool Monty", reporting on Mr. Burns' death:
        
        **Kent Brockman:** A humanitarian. A philanthropist. A man of peace. These are among the people that have gathered at Springfield cemetery today to spit in Mr Burns' grave.
        
    -   In "Mom And Pop Art", Ned Flanders a moment of frustration at Homer:

    -   In "Sideshow Bob Roberts", Sideshow Bob (who had attempted to kill Bart on several occasions by this point) after catching Bart and Lisa snooping, shows up at their parents' front door.
    -   Zigzagged by Mr Burns' opinion in "Brush With Greatness" on Marge's portrait of him:
        
        **Mr Burns:** I don't know much about art...but I know what I hate. And I don't hate this.
        
    -   "Lisa the Vegetarian" has Lisa wandering around Springfield seeing people eating meat everywhere she goes. She sees a billboard reading "DON'T EAT BEEF." with a picture of a stern-looking woman in a doctor's uniform. Her face lights up... until the billboard changes to read "EAT DEER." with the same doctor woman preparing to eat a venison steak.
    -   When Bart tries out for the role of Fallout Boy in "Radioactive Man", he is thrilled to be told he's the new Fallout Boy... until the director adds "That's what I'd be saying if you weren't an inch too short. Next!" After desperately trying to grow an inch by the next day, he returns to the audition room, upon which the director exclaims "We've found our new Fallout Boy! \*Bart gasps\* ...And he's right over there. \*The director points at Milhouse, standing right behind Bart\*" Later on, when Bart and Mickey Rooney try and fail to convince Milhouse to resume his role as Fallout Boy, Rooney says there's no problem because there's a new Fallout Boy right there. The next scene shows _Rooney_ as Fallout Boy. When some teamsters start setting up the Simpsons house to film some scenes, Homer meets the director:
        
        **Homer:** Didn't you direct "Unnatural Discretion?"
        
        **Director:** (Delighted) Why yes, I did?
        
        **Homer:** Phew-wee, phew-wee!! _\[Director looks at homer annoyed\]_ You know, I never walk out of a movie, but, Euggh!'

    **SpongeBob:** This... is... GREAT!
    
    -   Another had SpongeBob help his friend Patrick submit a song which is shown to be so awful that it killed the band recording it and causes pain to everyone else within hearing distance. He plays it first with Spongebob by using a giant stereo that is so loud that it demolishes his pineapple. After Patrick asks him eagerly to give him his most honest opinion, Spongebob stares at him solemnly and moves his mouth as if to insult him.
        
        **Spongebob:** Um... how do I put this delicately — THAT WAS THE BEST SONG I EVER HEARD!
        
    -   Another one, this time from "Just One Bite":
        
        **Squidward:** Why... this Krabby Patty may be the most... Horrible! Putrid! Poorly prepared! Vile! Unappetizing! Disgusting excuse for a sandwich it has ever been my displeasure to have slither down my throat! And I curse this Krabby Patty and all who enjoy them to an early and well-deserved grave!
        
    -   And in "Sandy, SpongeBob and the Worm", Squidward's reaction to Patrick's suggestion to dig up Bikini Bottom and push it somewhere else:
        
        **Squidward:** That idea may just be crazy enough... TO GET US ALL KILLED!
        
    -   From "All That Glitters"

-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_: In "Bon Bon the Birthday Clown", Marco and Jackie go to the school dance together, but the event is very boring.
    
    **Jackie:** I think I made a mistake.  
    **Marco:** What?  
    **Jackie:** I should never have asked you to the dance.  
    **Marco:** _\[defeated\]_ Yeah... you're right... why would you ask me to go to the dance with you...  
    **Jackie:** I should've just asked you out on a date.
    
    -   In "Baby", the titular character delivers her evaluation of Star's magical talent to Queen Moon.

-   _Star Wars Rebels_
    -   A really shitty one in "The Siege of Lothal". Admiral Konstantine tries to snare the _Ghost_ in a Tractor Beam only to catch Lord Vader's TIE fighter instead.

    -   "The Big Show": Sunshine Justice says that the recording she received of Sadie Killer and the Suspects is the worst she's ever heard. Which is a shame, because she loves the song, so they should try playing it somewhere with better recording equipment!
    -   "Together Alone": Steven throws a ball on Pearl's suggestion to try to get White Diamond's attention because he wants to talk to her. After Yellow and Blue make their grand entrances preceded by their Pearls, White Pearl arrives and announces her Diamond... will not be attending as she has more important things to do.

    Real Life 

-   This article on teachers' wages is one an _intentional_ example, used to point out the Analogy Backfire of comparing teachers to babysitters.
    
    _Teachers’ hefty salaries are driving up taxes, and they only work 9 or 10 months a year. It’s time we put things in perspective and pay them for what they do – babysit. We can get that for less than minimum wage. That’s right. Let’s give them $3 an hour and only the hours they worked; not any of that silly planning time, or any time they spend before or after school. That would be $19.50 a day (7:45 to 3:00 PM with 45 min. off for lunch and plan– that equals 6 1/2 hours). Each parent should pay $19.50 a day for these teachers to baby-sit their children. Now how many students do they teach in a day . . . maybe 30? So that’s $19.50 x 30 = $585.00 a day._
    
    -   Also qualifies as a Broken Aesop: $19.50 per student per day come to $3510 for a 180-day school year. Per-pupil spending in the US runs between about $6500/yr (Utah) and $20,000/yr (New York). To be fair, a large share of this is a mix of capital costs (i.e. the school buildings) and overhead (i.e. the principal, superintendent, etc.). If the schools in some places truly are useless (almost always hyperbole, of course), the parents would probably be getting a pretty good deal at the proposed rate...
        -   However, $19.50 per student per day, does indeed put one at $585.00 a day. For a normal U.S. school year of 180 days, that comes out to $105,300 a year, with each _student_ netting the teacher $3,510, and very few teachers make anything close to that.
-   Dorothy Parker in a book review: "This is not a book to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force!"
-   Another _intentional_ one- Mick Foley in his autobiography _Have a Nice Day!_ relates the following from when he was in ECW and headed to the WWF. The crowd chanted at him "You sold out! You sold out!" Foley responded by getting on the mic.
    
    I have a feeling that a year from now, I'm going to have to look in the mirror and admit in my heart that I sold out... I sold out the Garden, I sold out the Coliseum, I sold out every damn arena in this country!
    
-   Another _intentional_ one- when Madeleine L'Engle was asked whether the first movie adaptation of _A Wrinkle in Time_ measured up to her expectations, she reportedly said, "Yes, it did. I expected it to be bad, and it was."
-   In a YouTube walkthrough for Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, Michael Gray reads a cheesy script for _Light of Our Love_ and responds with thrill and excitement. "Oh. Wow. This soap opera. Sounds. AWESOME!!!"
-   A joke about a Grumpy Old Man talking to his neighbors, two male bachelors: "Two guys, living in an apartment, with no women around, huh? You know what I call guys like that? Huh? I call 'em lucky bastards".
-   This passage from noted cosmopolitan thinker Kwame Anthony Appiah is a more chilling example of this in real life:
    
    _They believe in human dignity across the nations, and they live their creed. They share these ideals with people in many countries, speaking many languages. As thoroughgoing globalists, they make full use of the World Wide Web. They resist the crass consumerism of modern Western society and deplore its influence in the rest of the world. But they also resist the temptations of the narrow nationalisms of the countries where they were born, along with the humble allegiances of kith and kin. They resist such humdrum loyalties because they get in the way of the one thing that matters: building a community of enlightened men and women across the world. That is one reason they reject traditional religious authorities (though they disapprove, too, of their obscurantism and temporizing). Sometimes they agonize in their discussions about whether they can reverse the world's evils or whether their struggle is hopeless. But mostly they soldier on in their efforts to make the world a better place...They are young, global Muslim fundamentalists._
    
-   Abraham Lincoln, needing advice on Simon Cameron, the Senator the Republican Party had basically picked for Lincoln's first Secretary of War, asked Cameron's fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens if he could trust Cameron. Stevens famously replied, "I do not believe he would steal a red-hot stove." (Cameron was notoriously corrupt.) Cameron, indignant, demanded that Stevens "retract" his statement. Stevens replied, "I said that Cameron would not steal a red-hot stove. I now take that back."
-   A popular humorous toast: "To our wives and sweethearts. May they never meet."
-   Upon winning his second World-Championship at UFC, Conor McGregor had this to say at the end of his victory speech:
    
    "From the bottom of me heart, I'd like to take this chance to apologize...TO ABSOLUTELY NOBODY! THE DOUBLE CHAMP DOES WHAT THE FUCK HE WANTS!!"
    
-   A t-shirt available (as of Februrary 2022) on several online shops:
    
    "POLYAMORY IS WRONG! It's either multiamory or polyphilia. But mixing Greek and Latin roots? Wrong!"
