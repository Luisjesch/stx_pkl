_O ne'er shall I forget the night,  
The stars were bright above me  
And gently lent their silvery light  
When first she vowed to love me  
But now I'm bound to Brighton camp  
Kind heaven, then, pray guide me  
And send me safely back again,  
To the girl I left behind me._

— "The Girl I Left Behind Me" (a traditional departure song of the British Army)

In cultures with a tradition of adventuring, there is often a yearly tragedy in which families are temporarily split up because some of the men have to be away trading, or fighting or bringing animals to market or the like. This brings in the character known as My Girl Back Home. She is almost Always Female (hence the title), though a child or an old man would work. The male version of Girls Back Home waiting for female adventurers are only a recent storytelling innovation, as adventuring was mostly masculine work in most cultures and time periods and stories reflected that.

Girls Back Home tend to be spouses or lovers though anyone with whom the character in question has a close relationship will do. Expect a Girl Back Home to be The Woobie, though she will likely hide her emotions under a shell of stoicism, at least until she is alone. In the meantime, they will always worry about her and feel guilty for leaving. That never persuades him to stay home, of course, because otherwise we won't have a story. Another trait of Girls Back Home is that they often occupy only a small part of the story except in the thoughts of The Hero.

Also, no matter what happens, if you have a girl back home, **DON'T** show a photo of her to anyone!

Related to I Will Wait for You and Long-Distance Relationship (although that one is a bit more gender-neutral in who gets left behind). You may have to return abruptly for You Have Waited Long Enough. Compare and contrast Dad's Off Fighting in the War. Aversion (sort of) of Battle Couple.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Winry can sometimes be this, though technically she's quite more proactive than the standard.
    -   Gracia was this for Hughes during the war. He unfortunately never heeded the warnings regarding the Fatal Family Photo.
-   Ange Ushiromiya from _Umineko: When They Cry_ starts out as one of these. She takes a few levels of badass as the series goes on.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Kaya could be considered this for Usopp, thanks to all the Ship Tease between them.
    -   Gold D. Roger turns out to have had one, whose name was Portgas D. Rouge. He's executed and she falls victim to Death by Childbirth some time later, so they go into Star-Crossed Lovers.
-   Cattleya from _Rave Master_ is this. Especially when Haru quotes her every time he has the chance.
-   Ryoko is this for Shin, who is serving as a mercenary against his will, in _Area 88_.
-   Rachel for Balzac from _Tekkaman Blade_, crosses over with Call to Agriculture and Fatal Family Photo.

    Comic Books 

-   The trope gets Played With in the WWI serial _"Golden Eyes" and Her Hero "Bill"_, which follows the adventures of American girl "Golden Eyes," her dough-boy sweetheart Bill, and their Canine Companion Uncle Sam during the first world war. The comic was published concurrently with the end of the war, between 1918 and 1919, showing the interesting ways authors were playing off the trope even a century ago:
    -   Played Straight at first with protagonist "Golden Eyes," whose boyfriend Bill enlists in the war effort and leaves her behind to care for his dog and Keep the Home Fires Burning. She does at first, selling Liberty Bonds and and knitting socks for the war effort, but the trope gets Subverted when Golden Eyes joins the Red Cross and ships out to Europe to work as a medic on the frontlines. She and Bill are reunited in France, but as an ambulance driver Golden Eyes winds up in just as much danger as Bill when the Germans shell her ambulance, take her captive, and threaten her with public execution for espionage. She even runs nighttime search-and-rescue missions in No Man's Land (under active rocket fire, nonetheless) to recover wounded soldiers. Golden Eyes never quite grows into the role of Action Girl, but her active participation in the war effort turns the trope entirely on its head.
    -   Played Straight (and perhaps Exaggerated) again at the end of the series, when the joyous occasion of Bill and Golden Eyes' Wartime Wedding prompts their fellow American soldiers to think back on the girls they left behind.
        
        "'Gone Away' flared the trumpets! — and Bill’s spurred heel jingled on the step of the cab behind his bride — 'Uncle Sam,' smiling a-tip-toe, clambered in — the door crashed to — and Bill’s deserted dough-boys each touched a breast pocket and thought of their own Girls. Back HOME!\[sic\]"
        

    Fan Works 

-   _Guardian_, which explores Lulu's backstory in _Final Fantasy X_, has her boyfriend Chappu cast her in this role when he joins the Crusaders, though she's not especially happy about it.
-   _Luminosity_:
    -   Edward Cullen of all people is a gender-inverted example in the first book, as Bella spends a lot of time going off alone for her secret plans as a Pro-Human Transhuman Rebel Leader. She'd like to simply bring him along, but has to keep things secret until she's laid a _lot_ more groundwork, since unlike her, he's vulnerable to mind-reading by the Volturi leader Aro. Edward's not too happy about it either, but he understands.

-   Mrs. Onedin in _The Onedin Line_. Also James Onedin's sister.
-   Auggie and Annie in _Covert Affairs_ have each been this to each other.

    Music 

-   "The Girl I Left Behind Me" in numerous John Wayne films.
-   "Lily Marlene"
-   "Girl At Home," on the extended edition of the RED Album by Taylor Swift. It's talking about how the guy in the song shouldn't pursue her because 'he has a girl at home and everybody knows it'. Interesting inversion in that it's in the perspective of the girl who's being pursued.
-   The Ulster song "Bonnie Woodgreen":
    
    _It was way out in Flanders at the back of the line,  
    We were talking 'bout sweethearts we'd all left behind,  
    When one Irish soldier says, "I have a queen,"  
    And she works in John Ross's of Bonnie Woodgreen."_
    
-   The Russians have "Katyusha" ("Little Katie"), who waits for her soldier boy. The rocket launcher system of the same name was named after the song.
-   The German army sings a similar manner about "Erika".

    Myths & Religion 

-   _The Odyssey_: Penelope waited twenty years for her husband to return.

    Theatre 

-   The song "My Girl Back Home" in _South Pacific_. Possible Trope Namer. The song was cut from the original production, but was used in the film and has been reinstated for the 2008 revival. Ironically the hero was singing that to rationalize cheating on his girl back home.

    **Eliza:** But you deserve a chance to meet your son
    

    Video Game 

-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   _Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia_:
        -   Lukas has a lover waiting for him, as revealed in his DLC support with Python, although he admits that they might not actually be all that in love with each other, as Lukas doesn't actually miss her too much. His ending never mentions if he got married or not, so whether or not they did stay together is left ambiguous.
        -   Defied by Tatiana, who tells her boyfriend Zeke that she'd rather use her White Magician Girl skills in battle than wait for him back home. While Zeke isn't too happy to see her fighting, he understands her reasons and promises to protect her.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem_: Sirius (who is the same person as Zeke in the _Echoes_ example above) plays this straight, returning to Archanea to fight on Nyna's behalf once more - yet returns to Valentia to reunite with Tatiana once his work is done.
-   According to the bios on the old website for _Ghost Recon_, the Sniper specialist Scott Ibrahim is fond of talking of a girlfriend he has back at home. It's specifically noted, though, that nobody else in the unit has so much as seen a picture of her.
-   _Rengoku_: During the war, Beatrice, a machine operator, has fallen in love with Captain Gram, a mercenary, and waited for him to return. She cries Tears of Joy and horror when she notices the prototype-ADAM learning data had his memories inside.
-   Marina is this for Ashley in _Wild ARMs 2_. She waits for him in Meria at the local bakery while he's off fighting terrorists and world devouring universes with ARMS. At the end of the game, it's revealed they've started a family together.

    Real Life 

-   In his memoir _Quartered Safe Out Here_, George MacDonald Fraser tells how Grandmother McDonald on hearing the news of the outbreak of war simply said, "I guess the men will be going away again." Fraser lived in a part of Britain that had long provided soldiery and the people adjusted accordingly.
    -   This was also featured in his _McAuslan_ series of short stories, where both sets of grandmothers have experienced waiting for soldiers to return from combat.
-   Common enough in Real Life for Mormon girls — most Mormon men, usually right after high school or college, go on two-year missions. These missions can be in places as diverse as Iowa, Australia, the Czech Republic, or Argentina — but they are designed to keep the man far away from home. Even if he stays close, he is forbidden to see his girlfriend, so waiting for a missionary is a common event for LDS girls.
-   A very extreme version can be found in CIA spouses. They are often parted for long times and the girl or boy back home often has no idea what is happening. Not to mention they have to give an extraordinary amount of trust to someone who is after all a trained deceiver. It causes unusual strain on marriages, but in those cases where it actually does work, it can be an example of The Power of Love.
    -   In other cases, the trope is averted. If the place they are posted to is relatively safe, they can bring their family with them. After all, "cover" basically means lying about one's job — the vast majority of agents make absolutely no attempt to hide their _names_, they merely claim to work for someone _other_ than the CIA (usually the Department of State, but it can also be another government agency or even a private company).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  So as long as the agent in question does a good job of that, their family isn't at further risk of leak or of being killed (the spouse or Significant Other generally knows, and the kids will just assume, along with everyone else, that Dad/Mom is a diplomat or something).
-   In the French Foreign Legion, a photo of "the girl back home" is one of the six personal items a legionnaire is permitted to keep with them during basic training (the others being a cigarette case, a lighter, a toothbrush, a razor, and a French dictionary).
