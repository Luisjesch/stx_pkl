An _incredible_ color for an _incredible_ family!

_"Besides, everyone knows that red robots are always the good guys."_

Red shows up a lot when it comes to the heroes of a story, usually the color of their clothing. As their main color motif, it could also be their hair color, gear, Battle Aura, or body parts for robots and non-human characters. This could be limited to the main protagonist or be as wide as an entire Badass Army. Some Chromatic Arrangement trios have the leader wear red.

The reason is that red is the color of fire and blood, hence the color of action. Thus it conveys that the heroes are people of action as well (regardless of exactly how the heroism is presented in the show).

In Japan, this was traditional in old Kabuki plays and the like. It's made to represent the hero bathed in the blood of his enemies. It is much less common in America due to the association with red as the color of the country's enemies (redcoat British in the Revolutionary War, Red Scares and the Cold War in the 20th century), but gets a pass if it's paired with white and/or blue.

**Keep in mind that since not all heroes wear red (for example, Blue is also very common), and other characters don't avoid that color, there isn't much point in listing aversions to this.**

A Super-Trope to Primary-Color Champion and Pink Heroine. A Sub-Trope of Good Colors, Evil Colors. A Sister Trope to Fire Is Red, Blue Is Heroic and Good Wears White.

Compare Heroes Want Redheads, Bring My Red Jacket, Heroes Prefer Swords, Color-Coded Characters, Purple Is Powerful, Law of Chromatic Superiority, Satan Is Good, and Red Oni, Blue Oni.

Contrast Red and Black and Evil All Over, Red Eyes, Take Warning, Evil Redhead, Big Red Devil, a literal Red Shirt (and Red Shirt Army), Char Clone, Evil Wears Black, Green and Mean, Little Dead Riding Hood.

Compare AND contrast Red Is Violent, which is sometimes used as its Evil Counterpart and sometimes its Good Is Not Soft counterpart. (In the latter case, expect overlap.)

    Arts 

-   In William-Adolphe Bouguereau's _Dante and Virgil in Hell_, Dante can only really be identified by the fact that he's wearing a red hat and red robes, marking him as the main character of _The Divine Comedy_. This is in keeping with a long tradition of painting Dante in red clothing.
-   About Sandro Botticelli's _Fortezza_, the woman's red mantle is a symbol of courage, which is associated with fortitude. Or, in this context, the strength that one must have when overcoming hardship.

-   _The Lady of Shalott (Waterhouse)_: The focal figure of the painting, Lady Elaine, is redheaded, and draped over her is a reddish tapestry. The Lady is more of a Tragic Heroine whose heroism stems from her bravery in the face of a fatal curse. Even if she knows she's doomed, she still embarks on a boat and does her damnedest to get to her Love Interest, which is the moment the painting captures.
-   _Thor's Fight with the Giants_: Thor, who is metaphorically ridding the world of evil, is wearing a red robe.

-   The 4th installment of the _Tales of the Undiscovered Swords_ is narrated by Kiriha Sadamune, a Long-Haired Pretty Boy with red pigtails.

    -   Atticus's crown has a red dome.
    -   Lexi initially starts without any red on him, but Chloe gives him a red headscarf during their expedition in the Cyan Desert Car.

    -   The Adelita Twins both wear predominately red clothes and are heroic characters based on La Adelita, the Mexican cultural icon of a strong and patriotic Mexican woman.
-   _Cars_: Race car Lightning McQueen is red and the central character of the whole franchise, though it's played straighter after his Heel–Face Turn.
-   _The Incredibles_: The Parr family's supersuits are all predominantly red. Edna designed them, after all.
-   Simba from _The Lion King (1994)_ is a lion with a red mane and red eyes. His father Mufasa qualifies too. Pumbaa is a red-brown warthog, but fits perfectly. Downplayed with Timon, as the only red is a small tuft of hair on his head, and he's a cowardly Jerk with a Heart of Gold.
-   The Time Machine used by Lewis and Wilbur in _Meet the Robinsons_ is painted red. The Time Machine used by the Bowler Hat Guy and DOR-15 is pale blue.
-   In _Turning Red_, Mei primarily wears red clothes, has red hair in both her human and panda forms, and is the main protagonist of the movie.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _DC Extended Universe_
    -   Superman's cape, of course.
    -   Wonder Woman's chest piece is red, not that she needs much protection. Diana also wears a red dress at Lex Luthor's party in _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_.
    -   Naturally the Flash in _Justice League_, as the "Scarlet Speedster".
-   In _The Hobbit_, Bilbo wears a red jacket throughout the film. Also Balin, one of the most outwardly virtuous and heroic of the dwarves, wears red robes.
-   In _Kagemusha_ Shingen Takeda's fiery lieutenant Yamagata Masakage aka "Fire" and the contingent under his command are dressed in bright vermillion red.
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_
    -   Iron Man, as Tony Stark himself says to Jarvis when designing his Powered Armour.
        
        _"Throw a little hot rod red in there."_
        
    -   James Rhodes a.k.a. War Machine has a red eye-lights on his helmet and red arc reactor.
    -   Aside from her hair, Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow also has red in her outfits and casual clothes.
    -   Thor has a red cape and other red highlights in his outfit, in contrast to his brother and sister, who wear green. In _Thor: Ragnarok_, the God of Thunder has even more red in his costume, even on his face. Odin, Thor's father, also wears a red cape and is for the most part benevolent.
    -   Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America has red in almost all his outfits; ironically when working for S.H.I.E.L.D., he wears all blue, and S.H.I.E.L.D. turns out to be HYDRA. However, in _Avengers: Infinity War_, the red in Cap's costume has either been ripped peeled off or faded, symbolizing his status as an undercover fugitive and his fall from grace since _Captain America: Civil War_.
    -   Hawkeye has red in his outfit in _The Avengers (2012)_ and _Avengers: Age of Ultron_, but changes to purple in Civil War matching his comic book counterpart.
    -   After her Heel–Face Turn in _Avengers: Age of Ultron_, Wanda Maximoff a.k.a. Scarlet Witch dons a red leather jacket and aura, though she's arguably more of an Anti-Hero.
    -   Sam Wilson a.k.a. the Falcon's costume is very red; he even names his Robot Buddy "Redwing".
    -   Hank Pym and Scott Lang as the Ant-Man have red outfits, as did Janet Van Dyne when she was the Wasp. However, Hope (Hank and Janet's daughter) changes it up by having yellow in her costume instead, which is accurate to most comic book depictions of the Wasp.
    -   _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_: At least when they all wore the red Ravager outfit, Peter Quill wears red all the time, and Drax has red tattoos.
    -   Red is the most consistent color across all of Spider-Man's outfits, with only two of them (the Stealth suit from _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ and the Gold suit from _Spider-Man: No Way Home_) forgoing it entirely.
    -   Doctor Strange has the magnificent dark maroon Cloak of Levitation, which literally kicks more ass than he does.
    -   Intentionally invoked with Okoye and the rest of the Dora Milaje in _Black Panther (2018)_; in fact, at the end, they set against the Border Tribes men who wear blue.
    -   The heroic android Vision is originally created with red Vibranium skin, though he later gets a peach-colored skin in order to blend in with humans. His red skin comes out when he uses his special powers, or whenever he's relaxed.
-   _Piranha 3D_: Danni wears red swimsuits throughout the movie and is quick to agree to the plan to rescue Jake's siblings from danger.
-   Sophie Scholl, the anti-Nazi activist in _Sophie Scholl: The Final Days_, dresses this way.
-   _Star Wars_' Rebel Alliance, with their famous "red bird" emblem. On that note, their elite team of Ace Pilots is code-named "Red Squadron" (although later renamed "Rogue Squadron").
    -   Similarly, the _Tantive IV_ has red markings on it. This gets expanded on in the _Star Wars Legends_ lore for _The Phantom Menace_, where the _Radiant VII_ in the opening is painted all-red; the Republic would paint their ships red to mark that they were diplomatic and thus not to be fired upon. Not that this helps either vessel.
    -   The striping on Han Solo's pants, known as Corellian Blood Stripes, comes in two colors, one of which is red. They are an award given by the Corellian military for conspicuous gallantry.
    -   In addition, in the original trilogy, the starfighters used by the heroes often fired red lasers, compared to the green ones fired by TIE fighters. In addition, Rebel blasters tended towards red while stormtroopers had blue or green blasts, though this was somewhat less universal.
-   In _Warm Bodies_, R wears a distinctive red hoodie that makes him visually stand out from the greyish zombies around him.
-   The British soldiers and officers in the Battle of Rorke's Drift in _Zulu_ all wear red tunic jackets, with the exceptions of the noncombatants and auxiliaries.

    Literature 

-   In the _Deryni_ works, the kings of the House of Haldane wear red (as do their liveried servants, pages, and squires), and the coat of arms features a golden lion on a red field.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Red is one of the colors of Gryffindor house, which is associated with bravery and chivalry, and Godric Gryffindor himself is garbed in red and has a red beard in his depictions. Also blood red rubies are encrusted into Gryffindor's sword to drive the point home even further.
    -   The red-feathered Phoenix is also commonly used in the books as a symbol of nobility and heroism (hence Fawkes the Phoenix with his healing tears, and the Order of the Phoenix).
    -   The disarming charm Expelliarmus is one of the few unambiguously defensive spells and lets out a red light when used. It's also considered Harry's signature attack.
    -   The entire Weasley family has easily-recognizable red hair, and they treat Harry more like family than any of his living relatives (particularly Ron, his best friend). Other good guy redheads include Harry’s mother Lily and Dumbledore when he was younger. For bonus points, they are/were all in Gryffindor...
-   The redheaded Lord John Roxton in _The Lost World_ by Arthur Conan Doyle. A Gentleman Adventurer and connoisseur of South American culture, he's made numerous trips up the Amazon, and encountered the natives being oppressed by slavers — all of whom he has personally made war against (adding a notch to his rifle for every slaver he shoots), while the grateful natives refer to him as "The Red Chief." Although there's a little bit of Mighty Whitey at work, Roxton is nevertheless a decent guy who goes above and beyond in his heroics, and the fact Doyle mentions his red hair frequently suggests this trope is very much at work.
-   Scarlet Benoit of the _The Lunar Chronicles_ not only has her first name but has red hair and wears a favorite red hoodie throughout the series.
-   Laeshana in _The Quest of the Unaligned_ wears a red robe through most of the book, and she is one of the three primary heroes.
-   Ruby the Red Fairy of _Rainbow Magic_, the Team Mom of the Rainbow Fairies and one of the most famous fairies in the franchise (fitting, since she was the first one).
-   Shallan Davar of _The Stormlight Archive_ has bright red hair and is a Lightweaver, the Radiant order associated with garnets. In addition, when she summons Pattern in his Blade form in _Words of Radiance_, it glows with red Tron Lines.
-   Fritti Tailchaser is the titular orange tabby protagonist of _Tailchaser's Song_. The book is about how he became a Living Legend.
-   _The Wheel of Time_: Rand al'Thor, The Chosen One destined to save the world, is a redhead who comes to favor red and gold clothes when he claims his title. He also uses a red-and-gold dragon as a personal sigil, inherited from his previous incarnation.

    Pinball 

-   In Stern Pinball's _Transformers_, the Autobots are represented by "Autobot crimson" on the indicator lights and the playfield, even extending to the cabinet in some of the Limited Edition tables.

    Theatre 

-   The Red Shadow from _The Desert Song_.
-   The song "Red and Black" from _Les Misérables_. Red symbolizes the blood of martyrs, the dawning of a new age, and passionate love, while black is the darkness and night of the status quo, and the despair of loneliness. Similarly, the red vest of student leader Enjolras symbolizes his heroic character, and the red flag used in "One Day More" and "The Final Battle" is bright red.

    Toys 

-   In almost every heroic _BIONICLE_ team, the red character, always associated with fire, is the hero and leader. This is subverted in 2006 with Jaller, who while being the leader of his team, isn't the hero of the Voya Nui saga, nor does he get the most spotlight. That honor goes to Chosen One Matoro, who is a Toa of Ice clad in white armor.
-   Downplayed with _BIONICLE_'s Spiritual Successor, _Hero Factory_. William Furno is initially the red-colored main hero, but he's only a rookie and the white-armored Preston Stormer is the experienced leader of the team. As the line continues and Furno loses his rookie status, the spotlight shifts to the gold-colored cadet Rocka.
-   _Transformers_:
    -   Optimus Prime is red and blue. Rodimus Prime is red and yellow. And Autobots in general tend to have more red than the Decepticons do.
    -   In an episode of _Transformers: Armada_, a boy comments that the red robots are always heroes. Even _Starscream_ pulls a Heel–Face Turn.
    -   The Autobot logo in all continuities is almost always red and the Decepticon logo is almost always purple. Notably, in _Transformers: Shattered Glass_ where the Autobots are evil and the Decepticons are good, they keep the logos but switch colors so the good guys are still red and the bad guys are still purple.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Red and other similar warm colors adorn several of the 'good' factions in _BattleTech_, most notably the heroic mercenary units Wolf's Dragoons and the Kell Hounds. The Warden Wolves are known for their prominent red and brown colors, and they are among the most restrained and protectively-minded of the Clans, especially after accepting an invitation to protect part of the Inner Sphere. On a much smaller level, the famous _Centurion_ Yen-Lo-Wang<small>◊</small> is pearl-white with a brilliant red sunburst covering its body (and a blood red helmet) and is most known for being piloted by two of the most heroic and talented warriors in the setting, Justin Xiang Allard and his son Kai.
-   In _Warhammer 40,000_, the Blood Angels are one of the noblest (for this setting) of the Space Marine Chapters, a group of optimists who genuinely fight for the people of the Imperium. Unfortunately, thanks to a flaw in their gene-seed, they might devolve into Ax-Crazy berserkers during combat and end up killing the people they're trying to protect. When this happens, their armor is ritually painted black and they join the Death Company. This is inverted, however, with the World Eaters and Word Bearers Chaos Marine Legions.

    Visual Novels 

-   Apollo Justice of _Ace Attorney_, with "a passionate heart burning RED!" Oh, and it's also his favorite color.
-   _Fate/stay night_ protagonist Shirou Emiya also has visibly-red hair, and has made it his life's vision to become a "hero of justice." The Servant Archer, despite falling more into Anti-Hero / Well-Intentioned Extremist territory, is also primarily decked in red robes, which makes sense considering he's Shirou's alternate-universe self.
    -   Archer's Master, Rin Tohsaka, can also arguably qualify, despite her Tsundere and ego problems.
    -   In the prequel, _Fate/Zero_, the Servant Rider (i.e. Alexander the Great) is probably the most affable, reasonable, and heroic among the Servants.
-   _Umineko: When They Cry_ protagonist Battler Ushiromiya boasts bright red hair.

    Web Animation 

-   _RWBY_:
    -   Ruby Rose, the main heroine, wears a red hooded cloak as a reference to _Little Red Riding Hood_. She is the most optimistic and dedicated to heroism of the main four.
    -   Qrow Branwen, the Cool Uncle to Ruby and Yang, wears a red, tattered cape.
    -   Pyrrha Nikos has red hair and wears a brown and red outfit. She is characterized as kind and loyal almost to a fault.
    -   Nicholas Schnee was an honest businessman and honorable Huntsman and is depicted in the show's world-building series "Word of Remnant" with a red scarf. The Schnee family is typically associated with the color white, to the extent that the current patriarch, Jacques, adopted the colour when he married into the family. The family these days has a reputation for ruthless business dealings and unethical labor practices but Nicholas forged a reputation as a compassionate leader who looked after his men and worked hard to lift the people of Mantle out of poverty. He is the only member of the family currently associated with red as the dominant color motif.

    Webcomics 

-   The bunny protagonist of _Blue Moon Blossom_ has mostly red fur, or is wearing some kind of floor-length red garment with specially shaped sleeves in the hood covering their ears and a hole for their tail. The red is also a bright shade that doesn't really appear anywhere else in the comic.
-   _Coga Nito_: Main protagonist Eric's Piece form is the appropriately-named Red Special. Niko even mentions that she's jealous that Eric gets to be red, and favors wearing a red jacket in her human form.
    -   Mentioned more directly later on when a character does a tarot-style reading using collectible cards themed after anime tropes, one of which is the 'Hero In Red'.
-   Dasien originally wore a red costume.
-   In _Homestuck_, Karkat and Dave are both red-themed heroes, as is Karkat's ancestor, who's a Crystal Dragon Jesus.
-   Jigsaw and Daisy of _Last Res0rt_, as members of Team Andromeda, are the only team that includes red in their color scheme. Matching ascots were added later after Daisy started getting self-conscious about her neck, adding a further splash of red.
-   _Muted_: Camille, the heroine, has bright red hair. The kind, caring Leroux family has a tendency to produce redheads.
    -   The unaffiliated Players Mob wears red as well, but theirs is more in the Red Shirt sense.
-   Commander Badass of _Manly Guys Doing Manly Things_
-   _Redd_ is about a girl named Vicky Redd, who fights super villains with bionic floating hands that are custom-colored red. She's rotten to the core.
-   The titular maiden in _The Selfish Beast And The Selfless Maiden_ has red hair as a human, and red scales as a dragon.
-   Airstrike of _Wake of the Clash_ has a cape and helmet which are both red. This fits with her desire to stand out and make a splash, but also reflects the idea that she is the most traditionally heroic of the main trio.
-   Though the strip is in black and white, when we do see the characters colored, Bob in _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ almost always wears a red turtleneck. He has a whole closet full of them.

    Web Original 

-   _How to Hero_ recommends that superheroes wear red, though, in a rather cynical twist on this trope, it's to hide the inevitable blood they'll be spilling more than anything else.
-   _Lightning Sentai Blitzenger_: Rai Akasaka is the sword-wielding on-field leader who proudly boasts about justice never losing to evil as long as he can fight and leads the charge to take down the Monster of the Week and save his Brainwashed and Crazy teammates. His code name as a Blitzenger is Crimson Lightning, and even when not suited up, his casual clothes incorporate red. Considering that the entire short story is a riff on _Super Sentai_, it's to be expected.

    Real Life 

-   The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.
-   The French Resistance, with their red Cross of Lorraine emblem.
-   The Knights Templar also used a flared red cross as their official symbol. Though their portrayal in fiction varies depending on interpretations, the group's stated purpose was at any rate heroic from their own perspective.
-   In the Eastern Orthodox tradition, red symbolizes God's love for humanity and is the liturgical color (the color of clerical clothing and hangings in the church) for the forty-day period from Easter (the main feast of the calendar) till the Ascension. Overlapping with Red Is Violent, it is also the color on martyrs' feast days.
-   A common visual cue in military traditions (not limited to the obvious Worker and Peasant's Red Army, the original name of the Soviet military) where solid colors aren't always used. The German and Japanese Imperial armies, the post-Civil War Chinese, Vietnamese and North Korean armed forces, and a number of armies in Latin America, if they used a color-coding system in military dress, used the color red both politically and/or as a 'heroic' color. At a certain point, it's probably the norm rather than the exception in color-coded military forces.
-   Samurai warriors in the army of warlord Ii Naomasa were required to wear a uniform of all-red armor and under-kimonos. This introduced the concept of uniform to Japanese warfare. Naomasa's men were known as "the Red Devils" for their appearance and fighting skill.
-   Actors playing a hero role in Aragoto theater had red face make-up.
-   Firetrucks are generally red (though other colors do pop up), and both they and police vehicles often have red and white light bars. In some locales, red helmets denote line officers in a fire department.
-   The burgundy beret of the Israeli paratrooper unit of the IDF is well known for denoting what is often perceived as an elite unit.
