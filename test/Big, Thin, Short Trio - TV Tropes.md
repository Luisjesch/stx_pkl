_Boggis, Bunce and Bean  
One fat, one short, one lean  
Those horrible crooks  
So different in looks  
Were nonetheless equally mean_

Usually a Power Trio of secondary characters, if there are three of them, chances are that one will be large and/or fat, one will be skinny, and one will be short. The big one will generally be good-natured, the short one will generally be grumpy, while the thin one generally remains as a middle ground between the two.

The tall, thin guy will usually be the leader, the short one will be the brains (unless he's The Napoleon), and the big guy will be the right-hand or the brawn. Compare Beauty, Brains, and Brawn, and Nice Mean And In Between.

Sister Trope to Fat and Skinny and Big Guy, Little Guy. Compare with Terrible Trio, which is usually composed of two "skinny" members (one male, one female) and one "short" one.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The main 3 characters in the original TBS version of _Aggretsuko_ are Retsuko (short), Eaglette/Washimi (thin), and Ape Admin/Gori (big). Fitting with the trope description, Ape Admin/Gori is generally good-natured, Eaglette/Washimi is The Stoic, and Retsuko... well, let's just say they call it _Aggressive_ Retsuko for a reason.
-   The three boys in the "Detective Boys" in _Case Closed_. Genta is Big, Mitsuhiko is Thin, Conan is Short.
-   Arguably, the three sister goddesses, Urd, Belldandy, and Skuld, from _Ah! My Goddess!_ Skuld is short, Belldandy is skinny, and while Urd is only slightly taller than Belldandy, she has a **much** more voluptuous figure.
-   Somewhat averted in _R.O.D the TV_: Michelle is buxom and bubbly, Maggie is quiet and thin, and Anita is small, young, and grumpy.
-   Warera, Konda, and Rori respectively, from _Super Dimension Fortress Macross_, aka Bron, Konda, and Rico from _Robotech_.

-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_'s Zygor, Sid, and Bonz definitely qualify for this.
-   Jose (big), Placido (skinny) and Lucciano (short) from _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_. Although the usual personalities for the short and big ones are inverted here as Jose is the grumpy one, and sort of good-natured Lucciano.
-   Foxy (short), Porche (skinny) and Hamburg (big) from _One Piece_. Foxy isn't that much shorter than Porche, but he is still about the height of Luffy, which makes him VERY short for a grown-up male (Porche is female) _One Piece_ character.
    -   The 3 Captains: Eustass Kidd (big & muscular), Trafalgar Law (lean) and Monkey D. Luffy (short..even shorter after he used his Gear)

        -   Cooler's Armored Squadron from _Cooler's Revenge_ have it as well; Doore is a musclebound brawler, Neiz is a gangly freak, and Sauza is a short Pretty Boy.
