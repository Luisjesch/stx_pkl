_"Assignment complete! Uh, oh no, wait, my bad. There's still one mission to go. Apologies..."_

The party of heroes just defeated the Big Bad. He's finally dead. Hurray! Now we can all go back and live peacefully.... BUT WAIT! During that final encounter with the villain, they completely forgot to deactivate the self-destruct mechanism he activated. It's not that they couldn't, but they just were a little pre-occupied with a certain antagonist.

Cue the Oh, Crap! moments.

Well, for whatever reason may be, the heroes have survived, but now have somehow been separated during the quest. Friends, family, or just people that are happy to see each other. When they finally meet back up, they take a moment to celebrate their reunion, but it must be cut short. They are quickly reminded that they have no time to spare and must continue on with their goal.

This trope is used to describe a situation that arises when a character or group of characters accomplish something worth celebrating over, but the moment is cut short when someone or something, usually the Only Sane Man, reminds them that they're not out of the woods just yet... Or they just simply forget. This is very much Truth in Television in athletic contests - sometimes someone showboats a bit too soon and winds up blowing their chance at victory because of it.

This is mostly a comedy trope, though sometimes played seriously. Sometimes a disaster _could_ be averted if someone had just remembered it.

Compare Out of the Frying Pan and Hope Spot. See also Your Princess Is in Another Castle!, for times when it's the _audience_ who realizes that it isn't quite over yet.

-   _Pulp Fiction_: Jules and Vincent have just cleaned out the car into spick-and-span ship-shape, and everything seems hunky-dory when the Wolf reminds them that they still have a dead body to dispose of.

When Link goes to investigate, a Not Quite Dead Ganondorf emerges from the rubble and transforms into Ganon, the true Final Boss.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_ features Link doing a comical but upbeat Victory Dance whenever he kills a dungeon's boss. He begins doing said dance after the first stage of the boss battle with That One Boss, but true to his trope, he gets back up, transforms, and probably destroys the player several times over between his second and third forms.
-   _Metal Slug 6_ has the the Alien Queen Final Boss.

In my book, that's a win." Vahlen just gives him a Disapproving Look before walking off. Sure enough, the Sectoid Commander wasn't the only one of its kind or the highest-ranking part of the aliens' forces, and the war is far from over. And with the _Enemy Within_ expansion, less than a month after you destroy their base, the aliens launch their own assault on XCOM's headquarters in the Base Defense mission.

-   In the ending of _Dream's_ Speedrunner VS 2 Hunters video, George and Sapnap knock Dream off the End island and remove his water flow, dooming Dream to eventually fall into the void when his remaining water runs out. George then celebrates by killing Sapnap, which causes Sapnap's Ender Pearls to fall into the void... and right into Dream's hotbar. What follows is Dream using the Pearl to teleport back onto the island, using George's shock and confusion to utterly own him in their final fight, and killing the Ender Dragon soon after with no difficulty. What makes this an even more notable use of the trope is that George and Sapnap had every reason to celebrate, as if George hadn't killed Sapnap Dream _would_ have died, as he had no Ender Pearls until Sapnap's dropped onto him.
    -   In the "3 Hunters Grand Finale" video, George, Sapnap and Bad make a trap near the End entrance platform (namely, they've encased it in blocks and intend to relentlessly bombard Dream with attacks once he enters). They then proceed to taunt Dream about the trap, believing he can't do anything about it. Well, Dream can't... but thanks to them telling him about the trap beforehand, that handy amount of TNT on-hand can. Had they kept quiet, Dream certainly would have waltzed into the End and died without a clue about the trap.

The heroes manage to bust him after he combines with _dozens_ of them, but then, as Egon tells them in near panic, the ghost trap now has far more ghosts in it than it was designed to hold, meaning they have to floor it back to the firehouse and transfer them to the containment unit before they break free _explosively_.
