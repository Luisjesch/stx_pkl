Ultraviolet light-emitting bullets. From vampire to Extra Crispy in twenty seconds.

_"Perfect job for these babies. Made 'em myself. Holy water, clover leaf, silver shavings, white oak... the works."_

Our weapons are useless! The enemy is Immune to Bullets! What can we mere humans do against the unending procession of impervious foes?

Quite a lot, apparently. By making modifications to our puny earth weapons (or, more commonly, to the ammunition) the world can be saved without having to Nuke 'em (which usually doesn't work anyway since 'nukes are bad').

These modifications usually include using the target's Weaksauce Weakness in the weapon, such as silver melted from crosses, UV ammunition, and Cold Iron. Expect the boss monster to be immune thanks to their Cross-Melting Aura.

This is one of the major mechanics/themes of settings in which the protagonists or PCs are mortals in a world full of nasty supernatural or superpowered enemies, with the progression from knowing nothing about the mysterious bullet-immune creatures to exploding a dozen of them with each shot being one of the major progress indicators of the story.

A subtrope of Weapon of X-Slaying, and the supertrope to the Silver Bullet (which is probably the original iteration of this, and in any case remains the most common even today). See also Abnormal Ammo, Armor-Piercing Attack, Elemental Weapon, Kill It with Fire and Kill It with Ice. A similar trope is the Immortal Breaker, a weapon that supersedes immortality. This trope usually utilises a specific item or property to kill a specific being, while Immortal Breakers simply call trumps over being immortal and is usually equally effective over all immortals.

Note that the phlebotinum shells in question do not actually have to be "depleted" in some manner to qualify for this trope, as the name is based on depleted uranium ammunition used by various nations since the 1970s.

    Garlic 

Hard to work with, but great against vampires. There's even a certain basis in reality for this — garlic contains Allicin, a potent anti-biotic and anti-fungal agent - and is a great way to kill mosquitoes. Remember that the original vampire myths described them as plague carriers instead of angsty nobility or teenage estrogen bait.

Comic Books

-   _Batman_: Batman soaks his Batarangs in crushed garlic for dealing with vampires.
-   _Blade_: Blade's opponents are sent into anaphylactic shock by garlic based pepper spray.
-   In Italian Disney Ducks Comic Universe stories, witches have a weakness for garlic smell, something that Scrooge has of course weaponized to deal with Magica-usually in the form of _artillery shells_.

Films — Live-Action

-   Played with against non-supernatural opponents in the Roger Corman film _The St Valentines Day Massacre_: a croaky-voiced gangster (played by a young Jack Nicholson) notes the belief that the garlic he's rubbed his bullets with will poison the wounds— kind of strange given what's known now about garlic...

Literature

-   _The Dresden Files_: Paintballs filled with garlic and Holy Water are quite effective against Black Court vampires. They don't work too well against the Red or White Court, however because Our Vampires Are Different and the "standard" vampire weaknesses generally apply only the the Black Court,
-   _Sabina Kane_ has a variation with bullets containing apple cider instead of garlic. Same basic idea, but in this setting vampires are weak to apple-related substances rather than garlic, due to having an ancestral connection to Lilith and the Garden of Eden.

Live-Action TV

-   _Ultraviolet (1998)_: Instead of putting garlic in bullets, they put it in smoke canisters. Minimal effect on troopies, knocks the "leeches" flat on their backs.
-   _Forever Knight_: In the episode "Hunted", a hunter shoots Nick with bullets stuffed with garlic.

Tabletop Games

-   The example of exotic ammunition (After his first encounter with the supernatural, an ordinary FBI Agent decided to upgrade his arsenal) given in _GURPS High Tech_ is modified silver hollow point that can be filled with a dose of poison (which in this case is actually garlic). The bullets in question are expensive but without any special quality, unless they happen to hit a monster's weakness.

Video Games

-   _Castlevania_: The manual for the first game stated that Simon Belmont soaked his signature whip in garlic juice and Holy Water for seventeen weeks before assaulting Dracula's castle. This is kind of undone since one of the first powerups the game will give you after every respawn is a ball and chain weapon that replaces the whip, and retconned out almost entirely with the increasingly-complex history of the whip in later games.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Played with in _The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion_. One quest requires you to kill a vampire, and reading his diary indicates that he has a weakness to garlic. He's annoyed at the fact that he's the only vampire who possesses this weakness (so far as he knows), making him a walking cliche.
-   In _Wario Land 3_ and _4_, one of Wario's forms is to turn into a vampire upon being bitten by a bat. One of the ways to turn back is to touch a hanging string of garlic bulbs. Depending on the situation, this may be good or bad.

    Holy Items 

Weapons made from religious relics or containing pieces of such are often used against supernatural foes, often in combination with special materials.

Anime & Manga

-   _Chrono Crusade_:
    -   The Magdalene Order uses scripture-inscribed bullets laced with Holy Water as standard ammunition against demons. They also have a small number of bullets which use the power of one demon to blow up another, with near-nuclear effects.
    -   The demon bullet was deemed a failure, however, another bullet called The Gospel is perhaps the most powerful anti-demon bullet around, which is described as "a magic bullet made of a rare kind of silver that's synthesized using alchemy which has a spell inscribed on it at an atomic level." The results are quite devastating.
-   In _Ga-Rei -Zero-_, SOP for gun-wielding exorcists is the application of spirit water (sometimes via grenade) in addition to scripture-inscribed bullets. These elements extend beyond gunplay, notably with inscribed motorcycle wheels and a weaponized iron.
-   _Hellsing_, Father Alexander Anderson uses bayonets that have been blessed which causes instant death to the fake vampires and causes intense damage and pain to true vampires, if they try to remove the blade, they will burn themselves. He also uses pages of religious scriptures, in the TV version it prevents vampires from using their powers and in the OVA it simply creates barriers that vampires cannot cross. The bullets in Alucard's gun are a twofer, being made from a consecrated cross melted down and cast, but also silver. They're extremely potent against everything except the above-mentioned Anderson, due both to his insane durability and incredible healing factor. Even then, though, the solution was just to make the bullets bigger.

Comic Books

-   _Astro City_: "Confession" story arc, a squad of alien invaders is armed with holographic crucifixes, restraining cables soaked in Holy Water, and a two-handed stake-launching revolver. They are thus armed because they know that the nocturnal super-hero Confessor is actually a vampire.
-   _Batman Vampire_: Joker wears a squirting flower on his lapel that shoots Holy Water.

Fan Works

-   The protagonist of _With This Ring_ can't use magic himself, but obtains several weapons for fighting demons.
    -   He uses the severed wings of the Archangel Gabriel to make angel-feather bullets that burn demonic magic in golden fire.
    -   He also obtains the Ace of Winchesters, a gun containing metal from a number of angel haloes, which has a similar burning effect but with the advantage that it doesn't consume the haloes with each shot; it merely forms a sympathetic connection between the Source magic and the target.

Films — Live-Action

-   Constantine melts gold from crosses to make shotgun shells. He also blesses the water tank in a building's sprinkler system (by adding another gold cross to the cistern) in order to spray all the demons there with Holy Water.
-   _Dogma_: Silent Bob kills the demon Azrael with a golf club he stole from a cardinal. As it turns out, the previous owner blessed it to improve his score. In that same scene, Bethany blesses the sink, turning the whole contents into Holy Water, which the skater-demons are promptly shoved face-first into.
-   _Van Helsing_: used a gas-powered fully-auto crossbow. It was only effective after dipping it in Holy Water.
-   _From Dusk Till Dawn_: The pastor with a Crisis of Faith manages to bless condoms filled with water to be used as holy hand grenades against the vampires, and holds them at bay with a shotgun and baseball bat taped in the shape of a cross. The shotgun does a fair bit of damage itself. Carving crosses on the tips of bullets makes vampires shot with them _explode._
-   In _Curse of the Undead_, Preacher Dan finally kills the vampire gunslinger Drake Robey by mounting the small wooden cross from his graduation button—made from a thorn growing at the site of the Crucifixion—on the front of a bullet and shooting Robey in the heart.

Folklore

-   In Swedish folklore, lead bullets are not only "lucky", they are also the only way to hit various supernatural menaces like shapeshifters, witches and their familiars, and animals protected by fairies. But it can't just be any lead; it has to be taken from a church window.

Literature

-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   The Knights of the Cross each carry one of three swords: a broadsword, a katana, and a saber<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Each sword has one of the nails used in Christ's crucifixion worked into the hilt. While Harry used to believe that the swords had little power on their own, acting more as a symbol being powered by their wielder's faith, the swords have shown that they are more than mere pieces of steel. Especially when the katana is now turned into a _lightsaber_.
    -   It also provides us with an _awesome_ vampire-slaying tool: a paintball gun loaded with garlic and holy water balls. It's up there with the stake machine-gun in _Sluggy Freelance_.
    -   Harry is also friendly with a local priest, so he keeps a set of Holy Water balloons under the seat of his car just in case. At one point the priest refers to a Noodle Incident where Harry asked him to bless a whole 55 gallon drum of water.
    -   In _Cold Days_ Harry infuses a bullet with Soulfire, the Fires of Creation to banish a powerful demon and fires it right at the target's head.
-   _John Dies at the End_: Dave and John use a Bible duct-taped to a baseball bat to fight supernatural monsters. Oh, and breath mints with the Lord's Prayer printed on them.
-   _Felix Castor_: Felix's landlord Pen fends off a succubus with a shotgun full of filed-down rosary beads. It seriously ruins the succubus's day.
-   In the _Anita Blake_ books, in order to better kill vampires, Edward has been known to take a hollow point bullet, fill it with holy water and silver nitrate, and then seal it with wax.
-   George Macdonald Fraser's _The Candlemas Road_ has an interesting inversion: a dying border reiver begs the narrator (a priest) to baptize his _right hand._ You see, his parents only baptized the rest of his body at birth: they wanted their son to strike "unblessed blows" (presumably in the hope that this would in some way damn his enemies to hell.)
-   _Discworld_:
    -   In _Carpe Jugulum_, we encounter vampyres who have trained themselves to resist holy symbols. This backfires later when their conditioning is undone — as a result, they now _recognize_ hundreds of holy symbols, and start seeing them all over the place when they'd have been blissfully unaware and unaffected otherwise. At one point, a vampire is beheaded with a holy item created on the spur of the moment due to the powerful faith of the wielder.
    -   In _Feet of Clay_, Vimes claims to have used the vampire villain's "poisoned candles to weaken someone" trick against him. He knew the vampire would smell garlic before it had any effect, so tries holy water candles, "the water burns away, just leaves holiness". The vampire isn't entirely sure this could work, but the point is he looks at the candles before Vimes explains it.
-   _Monster Hunter International_: Holy symbols in general work against undead and warding stones which specifically work against anything that's actually unnatural/eldritch in nature to the point of being an effective Fantastic Nuke. An actual bullet made of silver has horrible ballistics; so they get around this by making hollow-point normal bullets with a silver ball (basically, a modified Corbon Pow'r Ball).
-   _Merkabah Rider_: On the material plane, the Rider uses blessed salt shells that can destroy demonic hosts. On the astral plane, the Rider's gun shoots bolts of light that can kill spirit creatures.
-   _Trail of Lightning_: Maggie the monster hunter uses shotgun shells loaded with corn pollen and obsidian shot, both considered holy by the Navajo and effective against even noncorporeal enemies. They also work on people.

Tabletop Games

-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Many weapons for dealing with the daemons, who, while not Immune to Bullets, are damn hard to kill. The most obvious are the psycannon shells used by the Ordo Malleus. Depending on the source, these are either filled with various blessed materials or have anti-daemon runes and prayers carved onto them.
    -   Combining with Kill It with Fire gives flamethrowers loaded with Holy Promethium (napalm with the mystical properties of Holy Water). The Grey Knights' Incinerator is the best known example.
    -   The Imperium also has special psych-out grenades that negate the Psychic Powers of those who are hit. It is said they are made using a material that is created as waste by the life support system of the Golden Throne and emanates negative psychic energy. Yes, The Emperor's shit kills psykers. He's _that_ badass.
    -   The forces of Chaos sometimes make use of daemon shells, which are bullets or artillery shells with a daemon bound within them. When the shell hits the target, the daemon's energy is released, causing a very large explosion of warp energy.

Video Games

-   Garrett's Water Arrows in _Thief_ can be temporarily upgraded into holy water arrows either through one-time use holy water vials or visiting a holy water fountain. Strangely enough, these are actually used to permanently kill zombies instead of vampires.
-   Zig-Zagged in _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines_. In the intro level, Smiling Jack dismisses holy items as having no effect on vampires, and even explicitly tells you to shove any crosses someone tries to wield against you up the wielder's ass. If the wielder is of "true faith," however, then they are moderately more effective; Grunfield Bach uses holy crosses in his boss fight to blind you and leave you vulnerable to damage.

Webcomics

-   _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_:
    -   One quest featured:
        1.  Nunchucks made from Mother Teresa's bones,
        2.  A Bo staff made from the largest known piece of The True Cross,
        3.  Sai made out of St. Peter's sword,
        4.  And bullets that had been in the Pope's mouth(wash).
    -   The finale took it up a notch by weaponizing _the Pope himself!_

Real Life

-   This one actually happened in The Middle Ages, with relics (bones and personal items from saints) being used in the ornamentation of swords and other weapons. They were intended to be "blessed" with special powers (notably less successful than in fiction).

    Iron 

Iron, often Cold Iron or meteoric iron, is a traditional ward and weapon against magic, especially The Fair Folk.

Comic Books

-   In one _Wolverine_ comic, the protagonist is facing an opponent who is immune to any weapon forged by mortal man. He uses a weapon made of meteorite iron and forged by a demon to ruin said opponent's day.

Film - Live Action

-   _Night of the Demons (2009)_: After discovering that the demons are vulnerable to rust, maddie gets a Lock-and-Load Montage of her MacGyvering various weapons to fight them; including wrapping a rusty bed spring around her knuckles and shoving rusty nails into shotgun shells.

Folklore

-   In at least some versions of the stories, vampires are slain with an iron pike rather than a wooden stake, and/or iron filings may be placed under a child's bed to ward off vampires. In folklore, wood stakes and iron nails are used to pin the vampire in its coffin (and then other things can be done to the body). It then dies and decomposes (and isn't coming back).

Literature

-   _The Saga of Recluce_: features two distinct types of magic: Order-mage and Chaos-mage. Chaos energy has difficulty working on iron due to the natural Order energy woven into it, making it a solid defense. Additionally, Chaos-mages tend to build up a large amount of the energy in their body, so direct contact with iron causes their skin to blister painfully, and in extreme cases can lead to death.
-   _Redwall_: Martin's ancestral sword is reforged by the badger lord of Salamandastron using meteoric steel in _Mossflower_. The same sword is used by nearly every protagonist and has always slain the Big Bad of each particular novel (though not always directly, sometimes it is just used to, say, cut a rope holding a giant bell directly above the Big Bad).
-   _Discworld_: any iron can be harmful to The Fair Folk (which makes Tiffany Aching's choice of a frying pan as a weapon an apt choice). However, some places are protected by a powerful magnetic field to keep any iron from entering. Nanny Ogg uses one of Binky's horseshoes, which can go anywhere (like Binky's Owner).
    -   Considering an explanation, "cold iron" on _Discworld_ is an overstatement and means just "below Curie point".
-   _Born to Run_: humans fighting The Fair Folk with, among other things, shotgun shells loaded with "Cold Iron, holy herbs, and blessed rock-salt." One character also has a seltzer bottle that's been filled with iron filings and given a "pagan blessing." When he sprays the blessed and iron-laced water directly into a banshee's mouth, its head melts.
    -   In the same series, elves contemplating battle with gun-wielding humans had to be reminded of how dangerous steel-jacketed bullets would be to elves with a Cold Iron allergy. And that's without the humans even being aware what they're up against.
-   _The Soldier Son_ trilogy: iron beats any kind of magic and mages are "allergic" to iron. At the beginning of the series, the protagonist's country Gernia has subdued most of the magic-using peoples around them by switching from lead to iron bullets.
-   _The Spiderwick Chronicles_ book four: Jared confronts a faerie by pulling out a steel knife. His reasoning was that faeries don't like iron, and steel is at least part iron. It worked.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   Anything with a high-enough iron content is potentially lethal to faeries; Mab, Queen of Winter and one of the most powerful magical beings on earth, recoils from a steel nail in fright the second before it touches her skin. Harry explains in one book that iron is to faeries what nuclear waste is to humans — horribly wracking, and to be avoided at all costs. He even takes down Aurora, the Summer Maiden and a powerful foe in her own right with nothing more than a fleet of pixies armed with box cutters.
    -   Charity and her nail gun.
    -   As long as they have iron, ordinary bullets do extra damage against the fae as well — even if your opponent is the size of a semi.
-   _Steel Magic_: modern day steel utensils (like forks) are effective against magical creatures.
-   _The Witcher_: the main character carries an iron sword that is quite effective against certain enemies.

Live-Action TV

-   In an episode of _Blood Ties (2007)_, the protagonists find out that a dark elf is impregnating women at a fertility clinic. Coreen does her research and hands them a weapon to be used against the elf - a large and heavy iron spike. When they ask if there's anything more compact, she points out that the only other source of research about killing dark elves involves using 20-sided dice.

Tabletop Games

-   _Changeling: The Dreaming_: Cold iron (defined as "wrought iron") does aggravated damage to changelings... and if they die by it, their fae soul never reincarnates. The explanation is that the discovery of Iron working (and the coming of the Iron Age) was responsible for the end of the Fae golden age on Earth. Changelings, being creatures of dream and symbol, are especially vulnerable to it as a result. Later supplements explain steel not being so dangerous by the fact that it was invented by a powerful fairy long ago who sacrificed his life to ensure it would be harmless.
-   _Changeling: The Lost_, "cold" iron (material that's 95% iron at least) pierces fae defenses and hand-wrought iron does aggravated damage to the True Fae. One of the explanations is that the True Fae made a deal with Iron to gain mystical benefits from it as long as they made sure no human hand could change its essence. Once humans discovered smelting, however, the deal was broken and Iron decided it wanted to do some interesting things to the kneecaps of the True Fae...
-   _Hunter: The Vigil_ notes that the high-tech Hunter compacts and conspiracies, like The Cheiron Group and Task Force: VALKYRIE, occasionally use pure iron slugs in their guns when expecting fae activity.
-   _Exalted_:
    -   Fair Folk take extra damage from pure iron weapons (not steel or other alloys), and are resistant to non-iron. Woe betide the Exalt who's stocked up on magical artifacts with no iron weapons.
    -   There's a hearthstone called "Cold Iron Bauble" that can be mounted in said artifacts, which makes them act like iron to Fair Folk.
-   In _Dungeons & Dragons_, fae and Chaotic Evil demons usually have some measure of damage resistance that applies to most weapons, except for those made with cold iron.
    -   For balance, cold iron weapons are not only more expensive, but harder to enchant, which makes perfect sense for a material with Anti-Magic properties.
-   _GURPS High Tech_ has information on making iron bullets. They don't get better ballistics, and in fact reduce reliability in firearms... But if a Fair Folk has a weakness to iron, they cover it.

Video Games

-   The weakness of The Fair Folk to iron is the basis behind Fairy-type Pokémon being weak to Steel-type attacks.

Web Original

-   _The Salvation War_: gives us iron-tipped artillery in the form of High-Explosive Anti-Demon rounds. Normal High-Explosive-Anti-Tank (HEAT) rounds have a shaped charge with a copper liner so when they detonate they burn through the enemy armour with a jet of molten copper. HEAD rounds replace the copper liner with iron so instead of just burning through the demon like a HEAT round they burned through it with something that was poisonous to the demon and prevented its flesh from regenerating. Not that conventional (military-grade) firearms were any less effective against demons, over penetration of APFSDS rounds aside.

Western Animation

-   In _Gargoyles_, Xanatos tends to cut out the middle-man and have most of his weapons made of iron composites, just in case. Oberon may be a Physical God but even he takes major damage from anything forged from iron. At one (slightly depowered to impress his wife) point he is brought to his knees by Elisa Maza ringing an iron _bell._ In later episode he's toying with the main cast but finally decides to fight for real when someone impales him on a home-made harpoon gun.
-   When fighting a dark elf in _The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes_, Iron Man does the obvious and grapples him. But while this causes the elf pain, because the armor is only an _alloy_ of iron and not pure, it's not enough to kill him — but it weakens the dark elf enough for Thor to finish the job.

    Kryptonite and other Green Rocks 

If the enemy is an alien or monster with a very specific, non-mythological weakness, be it Kryptonite, Music, or Water.

Anime & Manga

-   In _Assassination Classroom_, normal knives and bullets melt on contact with Koro-sensei, so the government developed a special "anti-sensei" substance that breaks down Koro-sensei's cells. The knives and ammunition used by his students charged with assassinating him are made entirely out of this substance, which is conveniently also harmless to humans (it appears to have similar physical properties to rubber).
-   The _Cowboy Bebop_ episode "Sympathy for the Devil" features a Creepy Child named Wen who is really a boy who stopped aging and gained ageless immortality from the Lunar Astral Gate accident (which bombarded Earth with debris, killing most of its population and rendering it virtually uninhabitable). A stone from the incident is the only thing that can kill him, and Jet and Spike carve it into a bullet to use it.
-   In _One Piece_, Devil Fruit users are all weak to submersion in water, and Sea-Prism Stone is a rock that causes people touched by it to suffer the same effect as being submerged. Usually, it's used in handcuffs, restraints, and cages, but the marine Smoker walks around with a weapon tipped with the stuff despite being a Devil Fruit user himself.
-   _Tears to Tiara_ has both the Holy Empire and the angels use weapons made of Electrum, a holy metal, against Noble Demon protagonist Arawn. (The latter made it the ammunition of a biological "divine tank", which was used killed him the first time.) In-game, any equipment made of Electrum given to non-human characters (elves, dragons, demons, etc.) is only as good as whatever they were wearing earlier. It doesn't lower their stats, but it doesn't boost them either.
-   _Knights of Sidonia_: The Gauna can only be harmed by an exotic metal known as "Kabi". Unfortunately, the crew of the _Sidonia_ has no idea how to manufacture this metal, and are forced to rely on a set of spears tipped with the stuff to fight off any Gauna they encounter. Even those they only happened upon by chance, in an abandoned alien artifact. Dr. Oochiai later discovers how to manufacture Kabi using captured Gauna-based life forms, which leads to the _Sidonia_ creating kabi-tipped bullets that prove very successful at killing Gauna.

Comic Books

-   _Superman_: Kryptonite is Superman and his family's best known weakness, so it's hardly surprising that it's been weaponized against him. Kryptonite bullets, Kryptonite cannons, Kryptonite ray beams, Kryptonite cages, Kryptonite dust... Lex Luthor and Brainiac have made a career out of making Kryptonite weapons. The most spectacular being the occasionally mentioned K-Bomb, a Kryptonite-tipped nuclear bomb. In _The Third Kryptonian_, Amalak gets anti-Kryptonian weapons manufactured for his pirate crew: Green Kryptonite-powered sniper rifles, knives which give off red sunlight radiation, Kryptonite flechettes...
    -   Terra-Man carried a pair of Six Shooters modified to fire tracer bullets and other specialized applications; some of these bullets were made of Kryptonite on at least one occasion.
-   At the beginning of _Final Crisis_, Darkseid kills his son Orion with a time traveling Radion bullet — Radion being the one thing that can kill any New God no matter how powerful. Near the end of _Final Crisis_, Batman shoots Darkseid with the same bullet which jump-starts the latter's Rasputinian Death.
-   In an interesting inversion, Bloodscream seems to be able to recover from attacks by Wolverine's adamantium claws. Guess what happens when he faces Wolverine without the adamantium.
-   _Mighty Avengers:_ The Blue Marvel's last encounter with his arch-nemesis Evald Skorpion has the mad scientist shooting him with a bullet of neutronium — essentially raw proto-matter, and Blue Marvel's weakness.
-   In _Spider-Verse_, Spider-Man 2099 and Lady Spider rebuild Leopardon and outfit the machine with radiation, the main weakness of the Inheritors. Sadly, the machine lost it prior to _Spider-Geddon_.

Fan Works

-   _Aeon Entelechy Evangelion_: there are warheads enhanced with _The Colour Out of Space_.
-   Mithril-tipped bullets in _Saruman of Many Devices_, made from melting down a dwarven ring of power in Saruman's possession (making the mithril also enchanted). Given how ridiculously few of these he has, he saves them for one task and one task only: a last resort for killing Nazgul. He ends up making use of them in chapter 10.
-   In _Hellsister Trilogy_, Darkseid makes sure to have Kryptonite weaponry in hand before putting in motion his scheme so he can counteract his Kryptonian enemies.
-   Subverted in _To Hell and Back (Arrowverse)_. Kara carries around a Kryptonite sword after learning there might be other Kryptonians on planet. She also wears Kryptonite-proof clothes to protect herself.
-   In _Superman of 2499: The Great Confrontation_, a spell changed the House of El's weaknesses from incredibly rare Kryptonite to incredibly common saltwater, so anyone planning to entangle with a Kryptonian carries around a water gun.
-   _Gateworld Virtual Fleet_ has physics-defying Naqadah-Potassium warheads.
-   _Tavi's Blood And Fire_: While the Covenant plasma is better in a straight fight, special effects on mass accelerator rounds have their own utility and are available even on starship guns all the way up to dreadnought size.
-   _Warhammer 40000 Trouble_ has the SLAYER bullets. In terms of material they are just a standard tungsten-cored lead rounds. However said core is imprinted with microscopic anti-daemon seal, and whether you are puny heretics or daemon prince, sufficient number of bullets from mundane Pistol/ Revolver (which are better), Shotgun (even better), or Antimaterial Rifle, you're as good as dead. They work on Chaos Space Marines too, where bullets struck on their armor will cause continuous damage, leading to small ruptures which get bigger, and finally result in a big crack. More bullets or larger bullets works better.
-   In _The Vampire of Steel_, Willow's magically-enhanced stakes created to kill a Kryptonian vampire prove to be useless upon testing, so Kara fetches stakes made from Kryptonian trees as well as Kryptonite weapons.
-   Deconstructed in _Superwomen of Eva 2: Lone Heir of Krypton_ when it is stated that you can't make Kryptonite bullets because they would shatter.
-   In _Dust of the Stars_, armor piercing explosive rounds, meant for killing Cylons, do nasty things to relatively poorly protected Jaffa.
-   Subverted in _A Force of Four_. When three rogue Kryptonians attack Earth, Power Girl looks for some piece of Kryptonite to build some sort of weapon, but it turns out her deceased cousin had done away with every fragment he stumbled upon.
-   Intentionally averted in _The Last Daughter_. The author stated there is no Kryptonite in this universe and Taylor's enemies have no means to make it.

Films — Live-Action

-   In _X-Men Origins: Wolverine_, Stryker manages to bypass both Wolverine's adamantium bones and healing factor by shooting him in the head with adamantium bullets. The bullets pierce his skull, and while Logan's brain can heal, his memories can't.

Literature

-   Mythological creatures in _The Camp Half-Blood Series_ are only vulnerable to weapons of the magical metals celestial bronze, Stygian iron, and imperial gold. Usually this takes the form of swords, knives, and spears, but in _The Titan's Curse_, Annabeth's father saved the heroes from a fleet of monsters with his Sopwith Camel, using bullets made from melting down his daughter's celestial bronze weapons.
-   _Battlefield Earth_: the Psychlos are very resistant to damage due to their inhuman physiology, but anything radioactive would react explosively to the 'breathe-gas' that they used for respiration. In this case, the humans defeat all the Psychlos by simply detonating a nuclear bomb on their homeworld, and the destruction spread through their teleporter network. Though really, an ounce of plutonium in a lead box would have worked equally well.

Live-Action TV

-   _Stargate SG-1_:
    -   The mission of the entire SG project is to exploit alien technology or hybridize it with conventional weaponry to defend the Earth.
        
        **Gen. Vidrine:** You're telling me that a _slammer missile_ could take out a Goa'uld mothership?  
        **Maj. Carter:** When equipped with shield frequency modulators and naquadah-enhanced warheads... yes sir.
        
    -   By the final season, they have bombs capable of destroying stargates, which are nigh-invulnerable.
    -   By _Stargate Atlantis_, they've developed the Horizon system, a starship-deployed MIRV tipped with six 280 gigaton warheads and four decoys. For reference, that's over 13 million times the power of the Hiroshima bomb _**per warhead**_.
    -   Also in this category is the energy weapon the SGC develops in _SG-1_ Season 7 to kill Kull Warriors. Since Kull armor is, for all intents and purposes, invincible (one of them stepped on a claymore and didn't even break stride), they develop a weapon that disrupts the energy keeping the clone body alive. Since the Warriors' are rapid-grown clones with hyperaccelerated bodies to give them super-strength and durability, the only thing keeping them alive is the healing powers of a Goa'uld symbiote and ancient technology used to "imbue them with life" in the first place. Disrupting the latter kills them instantly. Also, since their body armor is very similar to kevlar, it can be pierced with a tranquilizer dart, which is attempted to capture a Kull at one point.
    -   Finally, after Season 8 of _SG-1_, the SGC has access to ARG's: Anti-Replicator Guns. Rather than firing a slug or a harmful energy burst, they fire what amounts to a localized jamming signal, shutting off the communication between the Replicators' component pieces and causing them to fall apart and become inert. Unfortunately, Replicators are able to update their communication modulation when they realize this is happening, so the ARG's have to be constantly updated in turn as the Replicators "grow immune" to the previous modulation.
-   In _Legends of Tomorrow_, an Old West outlaw named Turnbull uses a futuristic device (obtained from a time pirate) to locate a vein of dwarf star alloy, the same material Ray used to build his ATOM suit. Turnbull discovers the material's explosive properties and starts building bullets with it. In addition to being explosive, the bullets also go right through Nate's Chrome Champion skin, as dwarf star alloy is incredibly dense.

Tabletop Games

-   _Rifts_: The New German Republic has discovered that hot uranium(ironically for the trope title, _non_\-depleted) rounds prevent supernatural beings from regenerating or even healing damage.
-   _Hunter: The Vigil_: Task Force: VALKYRIE uses bullets treated with the power of SCIENCE! to turn them into super-high-energy rounds that can strike and harm incorporeal targets like ghosts.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: Golems and other constructs are often impervious to attacks unless the weapon is made out of Adamantine.

Video Games

-   _Command & Conquer: Tiberian Series_: both Nod and GDI use specialized munitions. In Nod's case, they have a love for filling missiles with various breeds of Tiberium\-based explosives or gases, while GDI has developed sonic-based and EMP artillery shells and grenades.
-   _Factorio_ features Uranium ammunition, made by taking conventional Piercing Ammunition and processing it to put U-238 tips on the bullets. They hit incredibly hard and shred Biters and Spitters easily.
-   _Monkey Island_ series: root beer is an extremely effective ectocide. It _only_ works on ghosts— when Guybrush tries this on the resurrected Zombie Pirate LeChuck, he shakes it off and chastises Guybrush for trying to off a zombie with a mere soft drink.
-   _Super Robot Wars OG Saga: Endless Frontier_: Though not particularly used against live targets, Haken's Night Fowl requires special bullets to destroy the Mild Keil crystals causing Broken Bridge antics and other chaos in-game. To ensure they're strong enough for the job, they're made from (or based on the composition of) fragments of the crystal type they're made to break.
-   _Rage (2011)_: Feltrite tipped bullets are more effective than lead, but rarer, more expensive and you are not able to carry as many of them.

Webcomics

-   _Nobody Scores!_: One of the characters acquires a chunk of Kryptonite and goes to sell it to Lex Luthor. Superman takes them out from long range with a traditional sniper rifle of his own before they even spot him.

Web Original

-   In _New Vindicators_, the Nephilim are children of fallen angels and men, with the power to channel hellfire for all kinds of super powers. However, they are vulnerable to a specific type of tektite, called mithral. More than one character has made mithral into weapons, such as nunchaku, as there are groups that specifically hunt Nephilim.

    Magic Imbued 

When only magic can affect a monster, sometimes infusing magic into a more mundane weapon will do a better job.

Anime & Manga

-   _Nasuverse_:
    -   _Fate/Zero_: Emiya Kiritsugu's custom "Origin Bullets" were filled with his own powdered bones, which contains Kiritsugu's dual Origins (base 'orientations' of an individual) of 'Binding' and 'Severing'. A magus uses magecraft to defend against the bullet? The Origins are forced directly onto his Magic Circuits, overloading them and ripping them apart, then binding them back imperfectly, thus making them permanently unusable.
    -   The _Nasuverse_ also contains "Conceptual Weapons", the highest class of offensive magical artifacts. One of the most powerful is a gun known as the "Black Barrel", which is specifically designed to kill immortal things, and becomes more powerful the more supernatural power its target possesses. In other words, it can One-Hit Kill Eldritch Abominations. The catch is that only an ordinary human can wield it: anyone with magical power finds it harmful to the touch. This is important in the story where it is featured, _Angel Notes_, set during a Post-Apocalyptic war against Eldritch Abominations, where it is wielded by the protagonist, the one single normal human left. The rest of earth's population has since become transhuman, and thus, can't use it.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_: Tatsumiya creates her own spell-imbued bullets for exorcisms and the like. Later, she gains a special _time-displacement rounds_ use within one day, which work as an effective One-Hit Kill for the ultimate in battlefield removal.
-   _Outlaw Star_ features Caster shells. Although the exact terminology fluctuates slightly depending on who is doing the talking (and who was dubbing/subtitling the episode), it all boils down to "big ass guns that fire bullets which explode into magical spells." The guns themselves are rare, but the more simple Caster rounds are relatively easy to find; when Gene needs to get the _really_ good ones to take on the Big Bad, he needs to track down the trio of semi-ageless techno-sorcerers that made them in the first place. And there's a reason the more powerful ones are hard to find: they're powered by the wielder's life force since there isn't a ready supply of Mana strong enough to power them otherwise.
-   The Belkan Cartridge System from _Lyrical Nanoha_ is a subversion. While it does involve loading weapons with shell casings full of compressed magic, in practice it's used as a Nitro Boost rather than an attack (though said boost can be applied _to_ an attack).

Comic Books

-   _Hellraiser_: In the "Razing Hell" comic mini-series, written by the Wachowskis, the protagonists manage to make bullets out of some of their own bones (starting with a fallen comrade who tells them how to do it with his dying breath, and later, in one desperate situation, a character uses his own pinky finger to make more ammo), since one of the only things that can hurt The Legions of Hell is Leviathan's own power (which has tainted them too, since they were its prisoners). They use this knowledge to begin a grim but very effective La Résistance campaign against the cenobites and the puzzle-box guardians.
-   _Superman_: in the Silver Age Kryptonians could only be harmed by three things: other Kryptonians, kryptonite, and magic. So if you don't have any Green Rocks handy, get that Billy Batson kid to shout "Shazam!" near him. This is played with in _Kingdom Come_, with Superman accidentally cutting his finger while admiring Wonder Woman's magic sword. Possibly intended as foreshadowing for his later battle with Captain Marvel.
-   To take down Black Adam, a bullet was made from a piece of the Rock of Eternity.

Fan Works

-   "Mage-slayer" rounds in _With This Ring_ are magical, but more specifically, they're enchanted to _consume_ magic, allowing them to disrupt spells and harm magical creatures.

Literature

-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   The enchanted silver swords the Wardens use can cut through enchantments and dispel physical attacks... as well as cut through nearly anything else (such as trees).
    -   In _Even Hand_, Marcone uses an old musket pistol to kill a Fomor sorcerer. The bullet is the one that killed Horatio Nelson, and then further enchanted to break through a sorcerer's defenses by Marcone's valkyrie security specialist. It's mentioned that the effort of enchanting the bullet knocked said valkyrie unconscious for two weeks.
-   _The Hollows_: Rachel injects paintballs with potions, usually Sleepy-Time potions; they take effect on contact as opposed to ingestion.
-   _Night Watch (Series)_: it's very difficult for an Other to be killed with human weapons, as their instinct is to jump into the magical dimension of the Gloom at the first sign of danger, where physical objects cannot reach. Only enchanted bullets have a real chance of killing an Other. A human working for an Other is given enchanted bullets for his submachinegun. These bullets end up killing a werewolf. Besides that, only a nuke can definitively kill an Other, because nuclear explosions somehow reach even the deepest levels of Gloom.
-   In _Shadow of the Conqueror,_ Daylen finds out that the Archknights are vulnerable to darkstone, and thinks about how he'd have created shotspikes to weaponize this against them, if he'd known when he was still ruling the Dawn Empire. The Dawnists later _do_ create such weapons, to disastrous effect, later on.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: The Others are creatures born of winter and hate everything warm. Though they fear fire, their speed and combat skill makes them difficult to set alight. Fortunately, in this world Valyrian steel and obsidian (also called dragonglass) are associated with dragon fire and can slay them. A flimsy obsidian dagger wielded by the obese and combat-aversive Samwell Tarly pierces an Others' ice of armor like butter and actually _melts its hands when it tries to pull the knife out_.
-   _Special Circumstances_: Generally speaking, weapons imbued with the spirit of a member of the titular organization are often either the only way or the best way of slaying a supernatural beastie. There's also a discussion, at one point, of how normal, non-spiritual FBI agents could battle the supernatural, using "Cold Iron" bayonets for their rifles.
-   _Tortall Universe_: griffin-fletched arrows always hit their targets, and Stormwing-fletched arrows go through magic shielding.
-   _The Girl from the Miracles District_: The mercenaries hunting Nikita in the second book are using bullets imbued with magic crystals that nullify her Healing Factor.
-   _Warhammer: Time of Legends_: In the Nagash trilogy, Nagash is soundly defeated in a battle where his enemies have acquired special magic arrows that down an undead soldier in one hit.
-   _The Stormlight Archive_ has an interesting variant: weapons charged with "anti-Light" can annihilate creatures of Investiture such as Fused or spren.

Live-Action TV

-   While it's not explicitly stated to be magical, a Chinese-made artifact in _Blood Ties (2007)_ called L'Iluminacion del Sol seriously weakens a vampire when stuck into his or her chest and opened.

Tabletop Games

-   _GURPS Technomancer_: The magical metal Necronium, is used primarily as a power source (and can sometimes poison those exposed to it and bring them back as the living dead), whilst depleted Necronium is toxic to all magical creatures. Depleted Necronium is also completely unaffected by magic, allowing it to penetrate nearly all protective spells, which is why Depleted Necronium bullets (which also share many ballistic advantages of real life depleted Uranium) have military usage when needing to pierce spells such as Reverse Missiles or just for killing magical creatures extra-hard (tho silver will do the trick for man in that category just as well).
-   _Mage: The Ascension_: Primium for the Technocracy, which is essentially a kills-supernaturals-dead weapon. Using it in a laser makes its wounds as agonizing to vampires as sunlight, Primium bullets hurt werewolves like silver does, and if you're afraid of magic users, plating yourself with Primium stops magic dead (some of the time at least.)
-   _Mage: The Awakening_: (the new World of Darkness's version of the above game) we are given Thaumium. It stores magical energy, it's resistant to magic, and it can cut through anything. Just for added punch, it's made from silver, gold, _and_ mercury, all of which have to be mystically purified to produce the essential platonic essence of their being. Yes. Thaumium is made from a mixture of _depleted_ precious metals.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: Thousand Sons Rubric Marines use Inferno rounds, bolt rounds infused with sorcery which can burn through even the heaviest of armour, and is said to be able to burn souls as well.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Anything under rules with DR x/Magic (Damage Resistance of x points negated by Magic) will have a certain number of damage points deducted from any incoming non-magical attack. In extreme cases, a Redshirt Army's worth of mundane arrows will be unable to harm a monster. On the other hand, one Player Character using a magical bow to negate the resistance can defeat the same monster using the same arrows. It's also possible for a monster to have damage reduction that can only be overcome by a weapon that is both magical AND has some other property. Unenchanted silver weapons will take down lycanthropes, but a vampire will just laugh it off unless it's both magic AND silver.
    -   Earlier editions had numerous monsters flat-out immune to non-magical weapons, or even magical ones below a certain threshold. The ability to hurt such otherwise "invulnerable" creatures was a major factor of what made magical weapons, even a lowly +1 sword, special.
    -   Whatever the edition, incorporeal creatures can only be wounded at all with a magical weapon. From 3.0 and further, ordinary magical weapon have only 50% of hurting an incorporeal being, unless they have specifically the "ghost touch" enchantment.
    -   Magic potions can sometimes be used as throwing weapons, taking effect when the vial shatters and spills on the target. This is primarily useful with healing potions against the undead, because who carries around potions of Inflict Serious Wounds?

Video Games

-   In _Eternal Darkness_, any weapon can be enhanced with magick. Imbued projectile weapons, including crossbows, rifles and shotguns, launch/fire imbued projectiles. It's not necessary for killing monsters, but sure helps.
-   In _Fatal Frame/Project Zero_, the character is often an otherwise ordinary person who has the misfortune to "see things other people can't see", which inevitably leads to trouble when they stumble into the haunted house/village/island populated by the restless spirits of the dead. The main weapon used to fight these incorporeal nightmares? A camera. Yes, a camera. One which uses some sort of special crystal or mirror in its makeup so that the user can see ghosts, dispel mystical barriers, and drive off the dead with the snap of a picture.
-   Biotics in _Mass Effect_ aren't _exactly_ magic, but they're close enough for government work, so Warp Ammo - bullets imbued with biotic power - would qualify. Warp Ammunition is a signature power of Jack in _Mass Effect 2_ and Liara in _Mass Effect 3_.
-   The _Dawnguard_ DLC for _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_ adds fire, lightning and ice-imbued _crossbow bolts_. Y'know, for when those vampires just don't die fast enough.

Webcomics

-   _TwoKinds_: the most efficient way to take down one of the series Evil Towers of Ominousness is to shoot the tower's core with a magic-imbued arrow.

    Silver and Other Precious Metals 

Silver weapons, including Silver Bullets, are commonly used on Werewolves and (less frequently) Vampires, stemming back to the idea of silver being a pure metal and/or associated with the moon. (Note that in Real Life, silver and copper do have biocidal properties. The idiomatic "silver spoon", as well as the common brass doorknob, is very effective at killing bacteria on contact. Silver nitrate is not only one of the oldest disinfectants, but the one of the few ancient remedies still commonly used.)

Comic Books

-   _Batman_: One story <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  pits Batman against a vampire, whom he kills (he did that back in the day) by melting down some silver candlesticks, forging bullets out of them, and shooting the vampire.
-   _Batman Vampire_: During the final showdown with Dracula in _Red Rain_, Batman attacks him with silver Batarangs. In _Bloodstorm_, his primary weapons are wooden throwing daggers weighted with silver.
-   _Fiends of the Eastern Front_: the main character melts down silverware and forges them into bullets for his machine gun to fight Constanta's vampire troops.
-   _Werewolf by Night_: the armor and weaponry of Moon Knight was specifically tailored for werewolf fighting, laced with silver throughout.

Films — Animation

-   In _The Curse of the Were-Rabbit_, the bullets needed are gold. _Twenty-four carat gold._

Films — Live-Action

-   _Blade_: at least the film and TV adaptations, uses silver-coated steel in his melee weapons (spikes and swords).
-   _Underworld (2003)_: the Vampires fight with bullets filled with silver nitrate <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Considering how thick and silvery it is, one assumes this ammo is rather stale (silver nitrate looks like table salt, but gradually forms black deposits of pure silver over time, or more quickly when exposed to light). They initially use regular silver, but those require a lot of bullets to be pumped into Lycans to be effective. Some powerful Lycans have even learned to push silver bullets out of their bodies. It also generally depends on how far away from a doctor a Lycan is, since leaving silver bullets in their bodies too long can result in silver poisoning, which is fatal to them. Then the vampires get their hands on the above-mentioned UV rounds and copy them with liquid silver nitrate. A single bullet can then be fatal (after time), since there is no solid silver to dig out.
-   In _Silver Bullet_, Gary Busey forges a silver bullet from some necklaces to use against the werewolf. When the gun shop owner looks at him strangely, he tries to pass it off as "the kids really like The Lone Ranger." The other guy has a smirk that says, "Yeah, right."
-   During the climax of _My Best Friend is a Vampire_, a Vampire Hunter armed with silver bullets (played by David Warner) shoots the head vampire Modoc (played by René Auberjonois). The latter falls, apparently dead. In a minute, though, he gets up to the surprised protagonist and shocked hunter. When asked by the protagonist (an inexperienced vampire) why a silver bullet didn't kill him, Modoc reminds him that silver is for werewolves.
-   In _Ghost Town (1988)_, Langley melts down the gold coins from the church and uses them to cast gold bullets for the shells for the sheriff's gun. He says that the gold will mushroom on impact, but it is not clear that this effect would be that much greater than the lead he is replacing, so presumably he also expects it to have some kind of supernatural effect on the undead outlaws.

Literature

-   _The Dresden Files_ tightens the qualifications by having a cursed werewolf<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  that can only be killed by _inherited_ silver. Karrin wounds it with her .22 sidearm using bullets made from her aunt’s earrings, but a .22 doesn't have the raw power for a killshot. Harry eventually kills it by propelling his silver pentacle pendant, inherited from his mother, with magical wind.
-   _The Bartimaeus Trilogy_: Silver is used as a weapon against spirits, since Silver actually causes damage to their essence, and can destroy them if given enough time. Iron also works to a lesser degree.
-   _Jill Kismet_: Hunters like Jill go through a lot of blessed silver since it's the only thing that can penetrate a hellbreed's etheric shell and wound them. Jill uses a pair of Glock Hand Cannons loaded with silver bullets, a bullwhip tipped with silver flechettes, and several silver-alloy knives for close-in work. Due to her own hellbreed pact, silver is also one of the few things that can potentially give Jill herself an instantly lethal wound; she'll heal up from nearly anything else, even assault rifle rounds to center of mass.'
-   Silver shows up a lot in _The Laundry Files_. Blevins contemplates taking silver bullets engraved with banishing rites on the first mission, but ultimately decides against it since silver bullets apparently tend to tumble in low-pressure environments. Similarly, one of Harry the Horse's shotgun loads involves "... solid silver buckshot, each engraved with the Litany of Khar-Nesh in ninety-nanometer Enochian".
-   Against the various werewolves in the _Jason Wood_ series, silver is universally efficacious, and when the Masquerade drops for good, the price of silver on the market briefly eclipses that of gold. Verne uses silver dust to fill the inside of an abandoned warehouse, causing what Jason describes as an 'instant asthma attack'; Jason, meanwhile, manages to use a silver-and-cyanide solution from a radiology silver recovery room to nearly end Virigar.

Live-Action TV

-   _Blood Ties (2007)_: Detective Mike Sellucci is given silver bullets made for his police-issue Glock 9mm to kill a wendigo. He pumps it full of silver before the creature explodes.
-   _Friday the 13th: The Series_: A werewolf was strangled with a Kodak film roll with silver in it.
-   In _True Blood_, the Fellowship of the Sun sent a suicide bomber whose bomb-vest was layered with silver shrapnel to attack a social gathering of vampires and friends.
-   In _Supernatural_, silver blades and bullets will dispatch zombies (reanimated by dark magic), shapeshifters, werewolves and more.
-   _Doctor Who_: In the classic series, the Cybermen's breathing apparatus intake was readily clogged by any gold which might accumulate there. Gold dust could be used to clog up the works if you could get your hands on it. However, the effectiveness of this weakness became Flanderized to the point that by the end, you had a handful of gold coins and a slingshot making a whole platoon of Cybermen a non-issue; when touched by gold they fall down screaming and sparking. When the Cybermen were brought back for the new series, they were an alternate universe breed who had the weakness dealt with in R&D according to a Freeze-Frame Bonus shot. However, a recent Cyberman appearance gives them some weakness to gold, though much much _much_ milder than in the old series. (According to the writers, the two breeds have worked together for some time and this new breed that comes from that collaboration has aspects of both.)

Tabletop Games

-   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_: Werewolves use silver knives on each other. More specifically, silver prevents a Werewolf from rolling to reduce the damage of an attack. The silver knives werewolves like to use (called "klaives") have War Spirits bound to them, letting them deal aggravated damage on top of that.
-   _Werewolf: The Forsaken_: if silver touches a werewolf's blood, it burns them for aggravated damage and has a rare chance of messing up their Healing Factor. Unlike in _Apocalypse_, however, using silver on another werewolf is a _major_ sin on the Karma Meter. It's also implied that the Pure get messed up _worse_ than the Forsaken because they never sought forgiveness from Luna for the death of Father Wolf.
-   _Hunter: The Vigil_: even the lower-tech groups, are known to use silver bullets in their guns, though they don't always use them against the right enemies (i.e. werewolves).
-   _The Witcher: Game of Imagination_: Weapons coated in or made of silver are extra effective against all kinds of monsters. Sometimes silver is the only thing those creatures can be hurt with. Silver also seriously mess up all shapeshifting abilities.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   There are rules for coating any weapon with "alchemical" silver. This applies a penalty to using the weapon so many players will carry a silver-coated sidearm. Magical weapons typically don't need coating.
    -   There are also spells from the _Book of Exalted Deeds_ that confer temporarily alchemical silver properties to ordinary weapons or to natural attacks.
-   In _Magic: The Gathering's_ setting of _Innistrad,_ the distinction is made that only _blessed_ silver is useful against the various horrific threats to humanity, with the largest prison for demons and such in the land being the Helvault; a massive spire composed of blessed meteoric silver. In vampire-controlled areas, knockoff holy pendants are a hot item on the black market, though the fact that they aren't blessed and therefore useless as a protective ward is typically not mentioned at time of purchase. Curiously, runes etched with silver are a necessary component to the creation of alchemically-reanimated zombies.

Web Original

-   Things Mr. Welch Is No Longer Allowed to Do in an RPG: _Some_ variants apparently are over the top:
    
    1117\. Can't strangle a werewolf with a roll of Kodak film, no matter what we all know it's made out of.
    

Video Games

-   In _Bloodborne_, Quicksilver (which is essentially mercury) is used for making bullets against beast, since ordinary bullets do not work against them. Although proven effective, firing liquid metal onto anyone wouldn't deal that much of damage as one might think. The bullets are also infused with the user's own blood, and having tainted blood makes the bullets deal more damage.
-   In _BloodRayne_, Agent Rayne has blades either coated with silver or made of a silver alloy.
-   _Silent Hill 4: The Room_ has Silver Bullets, which will knock down a Victim in one shot. However, there are only two in the game.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   Throughout the series (though the exact specifics can vary by game), ghosts can only be harmed by silver, Daedric, or magically enchanted weaponry. Alternatively, using the Hand-to-Hand skill, you kill them _with your bare hands_.
    -   _Skyrim_ has silver weapons deal additional damage to other forms of undead as well. In addition, the Silver Hand, the enemies of the Companions guild from the game and the main source of said silver weapons, use them due to the Circle members being werewolves.
-   _Nocturne (1999)_ has both silver and mercury bullets for The Stranger's twin .45s, that are respectively more effective against werewolves and demonic enemies, with a third type for vampires called "aqua vampira" (presumably blessed with holy water). No type of monster is immune to any type of ammo, but using the wrong kind for the creatures you're fighting is only as effective as a normal bullet would be.
-   _The Witcher:_ Witchers usually carry two swords on their back: one made of steel to fight mortal foes, and one made of silver to fight monsters. As Geralt of Rivia, a particularly badass Witcher and the main protagonist of the series, will tell you, "both are for monsters", which he demonstrates by using the silver sword on Jacques de Aldersburg, a particularly vile human foe whose Fantastic Racism has made him little better than a monster himself, at the end of the first game.

Western Animation

-   Parodied in a _Robot Chicken_ sketch: A werewolf is shown running from some kind of hunter and gets shot. The werewolf then claims "Only a silver bullet can kill a werewolf!" The hunter then proceeds to shoot the werewolf into a bloody pulp with a chain gun, light the mess on fire, snort the ashes, crap it out on a toilet and get processed in a sewage plant. Cut to 3 kids playing some sort of tabletop game, with the game master reading from the book and saying: "It says it's STILL not dead!"

    Ultra-Violet Light 

A common way to kill vampires, using UV rounds, grenades, lamps, or other tricks. Effectively, this is a more modern and scientific version of the traditional vulnerability to sunlight. An additional implication is that a number of supernatural creatures are susceptible to ionizing radiation (by definition, light capable of tanning skin is ionizing), which is often used to sterilize tools and food - cloth hung in the sun to dry is cleansed of bacteria nearly as efficiently as soap - tying into the concept of supernatural creatures as plague carriers. It also means that someone should perhaps attempt to kill vampires with X-ray machines or plain 'ol depleted uranium.

Advertising

Anime & Manga

-   _Ergo Proxy_: the only way to kill a Proxy is with shells that emit UV radiation, because the Proxies were designed to terraform the world back to normal and then disintegrate when the sunlight came back.
-   In _Gantz_ Kei at one point uses a UV lamp to great effect against vampires.
-   In _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency_, the Nazis, under attack from super-powerful vampires, develop shoulder-mounted ultraviolet lamps to be able to fight them.

Comic Books

Films — Live-Action

-   _Blade_ has UV lights on his car and weapon-mounted tactical light. Hannibal King's guns shoot UV-radiating bullets, while Abigail Whistler uses a bat'leth\-like weapon with a UV laser beam running through it. In the second film, Whistler and Scud design phosphorus-based flash grenades that can also deal severe burns to non-vampires, especially when a dozen blow up at once. Even Blade, who's immune to sunlight, is seriously hurt by the blast.
-   _Nightlife_: a hematologist creates a "prison cell" for a vampire by strategically positioning ultraviolet lamps.
-   _30 Days of Night_: ultraviolet causes severe burns to vampire. Unfortunately the protagonists couldn't (or just plain didn't) use it effectively
-   _Underworld (2003)_: As pictured above, the Lycans go armed with bullets filled with a liquid that emits ultraviolet radiation. It works very well.
-   _Van Helsing_: had a full spectrum sunlight grenade. He didn't know what it could be used for, but he thought it would come in handy.
-   Hans in _The Troll Hunter_ has an ultraviolet array on his car and an ultraviolet gun which he uses to kill rogue trolls, which is important because trolls are nocturnal. The first troll killed in the movie turns to stone by the ultraviolet light; the second one outright explodes, and the final one turns into an outright _avalanche_ from sheer size after being stoned.

Literature

-   In the _Jason Wood_ series, the protagonist kills a vampire by shoving him into a tanning rack. The resultant mess is less than pleasant.

Live-Action TV

-   In _Blood Ties (2007)_, a young vampire, made and abandoned by Henry's marker and ex-lover, tries to exact revenge on her by rigging the bright runway lights during a fashion show to produce a UV flash, which would have killed her had Henry not intervened. Her arm still gets burned.

Tabletop Games

-   _Dark Conspiracy_ has ultraviolet lasers for use against vampires.
-   In _Hunter: The Vigil_, Task Force Valkyrie uses UV lights to stun vampires. It's noted that only true, natural sunlight will actually harm a vampire, but an artificial light that replicates sunlight exactly can still trigger their inherent terror at being confronted by the sun.
-   One of the example Wonders in _Genius: The Transgression_ is a UV "Sungun" Lamp, capable of disintegrating vampires after just a few sweeps. And, since this _is_ intended to be played in the New World of Darkness, Geniuses with bigger plans will probably need these, and more.

Video Games

-   In _Vampire Rain_, the protagonists fight the titular vampires with UV knives (which can only be used once) in addition to their arsenal of conventional firearms.
-   Las Plagas from _Resident Evil 4_ and _5_ are weak to UV light. The parasites never expose themselves during the day (at least in 4), flash grenades instantly kill exposed Plagas, and in all versions of _4_ except the GameCube version, Leon can unlock a UV laser gun that instantly kills enemies when fully charged.

Webcomics

-   In _Derelict_ UV crossbow bolts appear to be the protagonist's chosen weapon against her robed and masked enemies.

    Wood 

If the enemy, usually a vampire, is vulnerable to wood, the solution is to upgrade the stake into a wood-tipped bullet or more powerful and faster reloading crossbow.

Comic Books

-   _Blade_: In his original comic book appearances, Blade used knives made from the hardest teak wood against Dracula and pals.

Films — Live-Action

-   In _Daybreakers_, La Résistance uses automatic crossbows that fire wood-tipped bolts to kill vampire soldiers with impressive accuracy. Their advantage is that vampires won't shoot to kill, since they need every surviving human to feed hundreds of millions of vampires across the world.
-   In _Only Lovers Left Alive_, the vampire Adam has a wooden bullet specially made, in case he ever decides to kill himself.

Literature

-   _Sherlock Holmes_: wooden bullets were used to threaten the Count in _The Holmes-Dracula File_. The Count himself notes (either in that novel or in one of the others set in the same continuity) that wood is deadly to his kind while metal cannot truly harm them. This is, in fact, what he takes advantage of to fake his death at the end of _The Dracula Tape_, Saberhagen's take on Stoker's original tale, to throw his dogged pursuers off his trail for good.
-   _Feet of Clay_: Vimes threatens to kill the Big Bad, who is a vampire, with a wooden arrow.
-   Wooden stakes to the chest don't _kill_ Black Court Vampires — the closest to the Dracula template — in _The Dresden Files_, but they do make the vampires go into uncontrollable, paralyzing spasms. Just about any kind of impalement will manage it, including high-heels and frozen turkeys.
-   _Sabina Kane: vampires are vulnerable not to wood but_ specifically'' apple wood (as in, wood from apple trees) — because in that setting, vampires are somehow mystically linked to the Apple from the Garden of Eden. Sabina even uses apple cider bullets effectively against them.

Live-Action TV

-   _Buffy_ and its Spin-Off _Angel_: both use crossbows, and Angel has two devices that extend stakes hidden in his sleeves. Connor also used an automatic-staker in his first appearance as a teenager.
    -   A later episode of Angel shows that members of the Wolfram and Hart Spec Ops Team carry wooden combat knives.
-   In _True Blood_, the Fellowship of the Sun developed quite an arsenal of wood-tipped projectile weapons. They're not the only ones. When Bill decides to kill Sophie-Anne, the Vampire Queen of Louisiana, he brings in a whole SWAT team armed with assault rifles with wood ammo. Even an experienced and powerful vampire like her can't do much against More Dakka of wood. Later, we're shown the the Vampire Authority has plenty of soldiers armed with similar guns.
-   Wood is used against vampires all over _The Vampire Diaries_, in forms ranging from a standard hand-driven stake to a crossbow to _wooden bullets_ that can be fired from a standard pistol. The wooden bullets aren't enough to kill; however, the homemade stake gun is.
-   The paramilitary vampire hunters in _Ultraviolet (1998)_ use charcoal-nosed bullets.

Myths & Religion

-   Norse Mythology: only mistletoe can harm Balder; everything else in the Nine Worlds has promised not to hurt him, because Balder is just so damn pretty. (The mistletoe probably would have promised too, but Frigga forgot to ask it.) Magnificent Bastard Loki simply cannot resist the opportunity this presented ...

Tabletop Games

-   _Rifts_ has wood-firing railguns (with embedded metal cores for the magnets to work on) on occasion for dealing with vampires. It also has actual depleted uranium shells (Not _quite_ depleted, as these were described as still being more radioactive than normal DU rounds), which for reasons unknown retard magical abilities to heal. These are great for those pesky critters that fight you down to their last MD point and then teleport off and return an hour later fully healed, giving you the time to hunt them down and finish the job. There are also shells made of non-depleted uranium that actively interfere with magic use by anything they embed in. Both can be cured by physically removing the round, however digging into your side with your own claws is generally A Bad Idea.
-   _Hunter: The Vigil Task Force_: VALKYRIE sometimes uses specially treated wood bullets against vampires-the bullets can come in all sizes, and can be used to effectively "stake" a vampire at range. Funnily enough, the round isn't common even though it's easy to make, partly because they feel it's too "low-tech".
-   _GURPS High Tech_ includes a sidebar on exotic ammunition. Wood has poor ballistics and armor penetration and thus is only good for triggering a weakness.

Video Games

-   _SaGa Frontier 2_: Wooden swords are the weapon of choice for most people the world, since magic cannot be channeled through steel weapons. One character uses this limitation to his advantage, however.
-   _God of War (PS4)_, being based off of Norse Mythology, makes use of this. At one point in the game, the dwarf Sindri gives Kratos' son Atreus a bunch of mistletoe arrows. When Freya sees them she demands the arrows and immediately destroys them to protect Baldur. However, earlier Kratos used one of the arrowheads to affect temporary repairs to Atreus' quiver; later on Baldur punches the boy, which causes him to get the arrowhead driven through his palm, taking away his invulnerability.
-   Discussed by Smiling Jack in _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines_. As with the other fabled "remedies" to vampirism such as garlic and running water, a wooden stake killing a vampire is another sham that _can't,_ under normal circumstances. Instead, it merely inflicts paralysis, which, while not fatal, leaves the affected vampire practically helpless to whatever their attacker may try next, such as, say, a shotgun blast to the head (deadly), being set on fire (_extra_ deadly), or simply being left to get caught outside when the sun comes up (instant incineration). Vampires even use the wooden stake trick against _each other,_ as a method of subduing and capturing rogue vampires for trial.

Webcomics

-   _Sluggy Freelance_: Riff comes up with this baby. Too bad it only holds one second's worth of ammo and takes two days to reload.
-   _Girl Genius:_ Dame Aedith of Master Payne's Circus is armed with a gun that shoots wooden stakes. It's intended to be used against vampires, if in fact she ever manages to meet one, but she's willing enough to deploy it against non-undead targets.

Western Animation

-   Dr von Goosewing's weapon of choice in _Count Duckula_ is basically a blunderbuss with a stake jammed in.

    Everything at Once 

For weapons that combine various weaknesses into one shotgun shell, sword, or what have you. Just to cover all the bases.

Anime and Manga

-   _Hellsing_: Alucard's bullets, like his gun(s), are made to order - each is made from the silver of a Lancaster cross that was specially melted down for the purpose. The fact that the rounds are also _explosive-tipped_ helps as well.
    
    "Nothing _I_ shoot ever gets back up again."
    
    -   He later receives a gun which fires Macedonium silver-jacketed bullets with blessed mercury (quicksilver) cores. Those don't need an explosive added, since mercury, being a liquid with about the same density as lead, virtually explodes upon terminal impact anyway.

Comic Books

-   _Astro City_ "Confession" story arc (see above): Mordecai Chalk, a cyborg monster-hunter. He had a shotgun that fired shells with wolfsbane and holy water, mechanical parts etched with holy symbols and crafted in iron and silver, and an on-board computer that references thousands of occult tomes. It doesn't do him any good.
-   _Judge Dredd_ has exorcist rounds for the Lawgiver. These rounds were developed with supernatural foes and contain garlic, silver nitrate, and anything else proven effective against supernatural foes.

Fan Works

-   In _When Titans Clash_ by Tenhawk, the Knighthood used counter-supernatural artillery rounds that were "... _based around a core of three kilos of military grade high explosive which was surrounded by a sphere of blessed silver segmented into frangible pieces approximately one cubic inch in volume. This was in turn surrounded by pure meteoric iron in a second sphere, segmented into similar pieces_."
-   In _Xendra_, Willow and Xander/Xendra load shotgun shells with quebracho (the hardest wood in the world), lead, cold iron, silver, and little steel crosses, plus shards of magnesium that ignite when fired. It is noted that making the shells requires a huge amount of time.
-   In the _This Time Round_ fic "Friendly Hopes", William Starr's shotgun contains a mix of lead, gold, silver, iron, hardwood, platinum and diamonds. He's not aware of anything with a vulnerability to platinum or diamonds, but you never know.
-   _Slayer and a Half_: Rachel carries around squirt guns filled with holy water mixed with garlic juice and rock salt. She also has boots engraved with cross symbols, and gives a pair to Buffy in the Christmas Episode.

Films — Live-Action

-   The titular character of _Hellboy_ fights most demonic creatures using a big honking gun (forged from a church bell, no less) with ammunition comprising of glass bullets filled with _"holy water, clover leaf, silver shavings, white oak... the works."_

Literature

-   _Discworld_:
    -   In the undead bar of Ankh-Morpork, the bartender, Igor, has a weapon as follows:
        
        _Like many barmen, Igor kept a club under the bar to deal with those little upsets that occurred around closing time... Igor's weapon of choice was a little different. It was tipped with silver (for werewolves), hung with garlic (for vampires) and wrapped around with a strip of blanket (for bogeymen). For everyone else, the fact that it was two feet of solid bog-oak usually sufficed._
        
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: "Greater Than the Sum" introduces a "multivector weapon" designed to use everything against the Borg that had ever been somewhat effective. Then the Borg get ahold of it before it could be used against them — and do what they always do — they adapt.
    -   The EU, specifically _Star Trek: Destiny_, tries to explain how _Voyager's_ Transphasic Torpedos are so effective against the Borg. Basically they're Quantum Torpedos which use subspace to simultaneously explode with every possible frequency. Meaning that no shield modulation can possibly block the full force of the detonation, only parts of it. The only way to defend against them would be a shield that simultaneously covers all modulations. Naturally, the Borg do finally adapt to them and it takes a Deus ex Machina to save the Federation.
-   _The Bartimaeus Trilogy_: All spirits from the weakest mite to the greatest marid can be severely hurt by silver, iron, and certain types of herbs and spices, such as rosemary. Magicians, commoners, and other spirits exploit this to no end. It gets to the point where powerful spirits are taken down by improvised use of everyday metals more often than they are by the devastatingly destructive spells these entities can employ.
-   _Elemental Masters_:
    -   In _Reserved for the Cat_, the heroine carries a revolver loaded with two Cold Iron bullets, two Silver Bullets, and two Blessed Lead bullets, plus extra ammo of all three types. It's anyone's guess which type offed the mystical Big Bad at the end of the novel.
    -   In _Unnatural Issue_, the Kerridge family have similar bullets for their shotguns, and they along with their friend Peter and his valet Garrick also have shotgun shells filled with blessed salt to take down the undead.
-   In _The Good, the Bad and the Mediochre_, the tempomancer threatens to shoot Dhampinella with a tranquiliser dart loaded with garlic oil, citric acid and holy water. With a crucifix motif.
-   While Vampires and Werewolves have largely integrated into the alternate Victorian setting of _The Parasol Protectorate_, there are still quite a few characters who like to be prepared. Alexia's signature parasol, for example, has retractable spikes of both silver and wood along with a chemical spray tailored to each, one of which doubles as a powerful acid. Other examples include sundowner bullets (wooden musket balls banded with silver) and, amusingly, pesto sauce (Werewolves in this universe are allergic to basil. Throw in some garlic...).
-   _My Vampire Older Sister and Zombie Little Sister_ has anti-vampire bullets, made from consecrated steel or silver that was soaked in holy water when cooled.
-   _The Fall of the House of Cabal_: In the Five Ways challenge, Leonie wields a shotgun with shells containing a mixture of every major anti-supernatural substance, from rock salt to blessed silver to demon-dissolving Leng metal from the Dreamlands. She very much enjoys it.

Live-Action TV

-   _Supernatural_:
    -   The hunters have to improvise a variety of weapons to kill a variety of creatures. The hunter's arsenal makes use of most of the above, _except_ garlic. The most frequent example is their use of shotgun shells loaded with rock salt against ghosts. Ghosts cannot act on iron, and are killed when their remains are salted and burned. Bobby's saferoom is walled with Iron treated with rock salt. Holy weapons can be found with holy water, which cannot be crossed by demons, or holy _oil_, which cannot be crossed by _angels_. This has even been weaponized into a molotov cocktail. And when all else fails, there's a magical gun and knife that kill _everything_. Except when they don't.
    -   The alpha shifter proves vulnerable to iridium.
    -   The general method seems to be — if it's a demon, apply holy water followed by magic knife or exorcism (if you have time). If not, apply iron, silver, and liberal amounts of salt (often loaded into shotguns) and fire. All that said, the one thing that seems to have been capable of taking down anything a hunter faces (with a few exceptions) is relatively mundane - beheading. It's the only way to kill a vampire (aside from the Colt). Okami are susceptible to being run through a wood chipper. Wood chippers pretty much trump...everything. Presumably, they would work on a fair amount of monsters but the Okami is the only one ever shown in the show. Demons and Angels are more complicated because they inhabit hosts; reducing them to Chunky Salsa would just slow them down because they'd have to find a new body.
    -   It's unclear what exactly was special about the original bullets the Colt fired, but it allowed them to kill almost anything in one shot. Lucifer claimed to be one of five things in all of creation it couldn't kill. After the original bullets were used up, Ruby showed Bobby Singer how to make make more that worked just as well. In Season 12, Sam revealed that the process was to take a silver bullet, coat it in holy oil, sage, and myrrh, and then use a particular spell. All of this together would "mimic the original etchings." Interestingly, despite this being used on the _bullets_, not only did nobody then ever tried to fire them with any other gun (possibly justified by the Colt being chambered in an outdated and now uncommon calibre) but neither did they try applying the same process to modern ammunition. This suggests there was something unique about the Colt itself that no one knew how to duplicate... Or that the writers figured that would be a Story-Breaker Power.

Tabletop Games

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ includes a plethora of monsters with varying types of damage reduction, such as werecreatures, demons, fey and others, which often results in adventurers carrying around extensive collections of weapons ("No, we need a _silver_ magical weapon that does piercing damage, not a cold iron one!"). Both melee weapons and ammunition for projectiles are often made from these special materials.
    -   An insanely genius item introduced in one of the guides by Van Richten of _Ravenloft_ was a weakness-detecting arrow. Rather than a traditional point, it had needles from over a dozen different substances, like cold iron, gold, silver, wood, and so on. When fired, it does minimal damage to its target, but also does not embed itself. After it is recovered, the wielder can see what substance did the harm based on which other needles are broken or bent, and (depending on the target) which needle has the blood stain.
    -   Epic-level monsters (i.e. challenges for level 21+ characters) sometimes require truly bizarre weapons to deal normal damage to them. A time-elemental Phane can only take normal damage from weapons from an alternate history, for example, and a mind-consuming Dream Larva only takes real damage from weapons forged by a _sleepwalking blacksmith._
    -   The Regeneration Ability that stops a creature from being killed by attacks that do not overcome it. For example trolls can only be killed by fire or acid damage.
    -   There are magical weapon enhancements that can compensate for the "golf bag scabbard" problem. Metalline weapons overcome any damage reduction based on the material composition of the weapon, Transforming weapons can change shape into other types of weapons which deal damage in a different manner (bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or some combination), and Shadowstriking weapons can temporarily attune themselves to a particular creature and overcome whatever damage reduction it happens to have.
    -   One _Dragon_ article on almost-as-good-as-magical items suited for low-level adventurers to retrieve proposed the inclusion of "coldsilver" weapons: weapons that didn't have any bonuses, but which incorporated both silver _and_ Cold Iron into their substance. Hence, they could do damage to monsters resistant to non-magical attack, but vulnerable to either one or the other metal.
-   In _The Dresden Files_ RPG, many types of supernatural creature have a power that improves their toughness and/or regeneration. Every one of these is required to have a "Catch" or critical weakness, which will prevent their durability or recovery from taking effect. Catches are rated on a points system (helping to offset the cost of the original powers), with more common weaknesses providing a bigger refund. For instance, a creature that's weak against fire or sunlight gets a 4-point discount, because this is well-known and easy to find; one vulnerable to something more esoteric like True Love might only get 2 points, and someone vulnerable to only a specific, difficult-to-find object (such as the Noose of Barrabas) gets nothing. However, certain rare artifacts and powers allow a player to spend a fate point to simply _declare_ that their next attack matches a given target's Catch, allowing them to penetrate whatever supernatural defenses it might have.
-   The anti-vampire kit in _GURPS Steam-Tech_ includes a revolver with a selection of silver bullets, lead bullets inscribed with crosses, hardwood bullets, and actual miniature stakes which can be fired with a blank cartridge. How well they work depends on the kind of vampire and the quality of the specific kit (in the accompanying vignette, an unfortunate vampire hunter discovers - among several other problems with his kit - that the stakes don't actually fit the gun, and tend to fall out).
-   In _Hunter: The Vigil_, this is one of Task Force: VALKYRIE's Endowments, called Compound Rounds, which deal Lethal damage against supernatural targets that would usually only take Bashing damage from bullets. Come in various sizes for extra fun. However, the substances inside the bullet is too little to do aggravated damage.

Video Games

-   _City of Heroes_: This may be the only explanation for heroes with assault rifles being able to take anything down at all. Unfortunately this works the other way, too, as mooks and bosses of a high enough level can worry heroes protected by magical forces, power armor, and the like with ordinary guns.

Webcomics

-   _Grrl Power_ at some point shows a grenade containing silver buckshot, iron and (undecided) (see The Rant, which mentions wood and salt as possibilities).
-   _Parallel Dementia_: Fall and other Nightmare hunters use blessed weapons (to combat demons), obsidian (for angels), garlic (for undead), iron (for fey), amethyst (for spawn), and silver (for therians) to combat the various types of Nightmares. On at least one occasion, Fall is given specially made ammunition incorporating all of these at once, because she's about to head into an extremely tense situation and standard operating procedure (using a test clip loaded with one of each kind of ammo, in a specific order, so that you can switch to full clips of the appropriate variety when you find the one that works) would be dangerously time-consuming.

Web Original

-   The legendary Usenet poster "Gharlane of Eddore" once proposed a design for a Standard Generic Monster Load, which was:
    
    Silver bullet; hex-scored jacketed hollow-point filled with a gel made of Holy Water, wolfsbane, garlic, fugu toxin and curare, laced with dimethyl sulfoxide to provide tractor-solvent Spreading Factor. Traditionalists can also cut crosses in the bases of the bullets, and have them blessed by a priest. .44 magnum 240-grain load over the standard Elmer Keith hunting load, 24 grains of IMR 2400 (the manual says 21.8 grains is maximum, so don't use the 24-grain load if you have a cheap revolver). These work reliably on Vampires, Werewolves, the generic Undead, and Evil Human Minions like Renfield, with sublime indifference.

If bullets won't kill it, then obviously the answer is to make better bullets. If they're just really well protected, use a harder material like bronze or tungsten. If somebody's playing tricks with magnets, use compressed plastic. With magnesium, you can Kill It with Fire! Or perhaps you can recycle their phlebotinum and Hoist Them By Their Own Petard.

Anime & Manga

-   One of Zazie's secret weapons in the ZOTT tournament in _Battle Angel Alita Last Order_ is a pair of revolvers loaded with bullets with osmium tips (osmium being the densest naturally occurring metal.)
-   Sven from _Black Cat_ packs an array of interesting bullets, and among these there are blue-tipped ones that freezes the opponent on contact.
-   _Elfen Lied_: When traditional firearms prove useless against the diclonii, the antagonists resort to anti-tank rifles loaded with purpose-made tungsten slugs, which are too heavy for the diclonii's Vectors to easily deflect.
-   Kiritsugu Emiya of _Fate/Zero_ uses bullets containing one of his ribs (powdered, of course), which hit exponentially harder as his opponents dedicate more of their magic circuits to defense - and destroys those magic circuits in the process.
-   In _Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force_, Teana gains bullets that inject anti-Eclipse drugs. Eclipse Drivers that are shot by these will have their Healing Factor drastically reduced and could now receive lasting damage.
-   A Freeze-Frame Bonus in _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz_ shows that Heavyarms Kai's Double Gatling Guns use Gundanium-jacketed bullets; since Gundanium is exceptionally tough, this presumably makes the bullets hit harder.
-   Gene's Caster in _Outlaw Star_ fires bullets that contain magic spells. They're ridiculously rare, which means Jim is always on Gene's case whenever he has to use one (which is far more often than either would like).
-   In _Rebuild World_, CWH rounds are specially-made armor-piercing bullets designed for use with an anti-materiel rifle when normal piercing rounds don't cut it. These rounds are so powerful that they can take down monsters the size of a building by blasting a bus-sized hole in their skulls while still retaining enough momentum to shatter a part of a concrete structure behind it. Smaller monsters are instead reduced to unrecognizable Ludicrous Gibs. Naturally, this level of power comes with a price tag that makes it Too Awesome to Use, leaving hunters to pack only one or two of them for emergencies.
-   Kittan in _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ at one point attempts to hold off a Mugann with a shotgun packing "Spiral shells." A more impressive one is issued to Grapearls, producing huge explosions _and_ a shell to contain the aftermath of a Mugann going blooie.

Comic Books

-   _X-Men_: Magneto, Master of Magnetism is often faced with plastic or composite weapons, and was locked in a "plastic prison" on more than one occasion. In _X-Men: The Animated Series_ a Sentinel boasts about how its plastic coating stops Magneto's powers... Magneto's response is an annoyed "You fools, this whole _ship_ is my _weapon!_" and promptly throws the huge generators nearby through the Sentinels.
-   _The Mighty_: Gabriel Cole was given some special bullets. It turns out that it's special condensed nitrogen bullets to use against the invulnerable Alpha One since he needs to breathe more oxygen than most people.
-   The Daximites, a race of aliens which has Superman's powers, only weakness is LEAD, which means that any attempt to take over the Earth while firearms and lead bullets are the most common weaponry on the planet is pretty futile.
-   In _The Boys_ it's shown that actual depleted uranium ammunition is a common weakness of superheroes.

Fan Works

-   _The Secret Return of Alex Mack_: Getting doused with GC-161 can give regular humans superpowers, but for some reason, the genetic enhancements of the Breslynn Orphans mean that GC-161 is toxic to them, melting their bodies on contact — so people start making GC-161 grenades. (Orphans aren't immune to regular weapons, but they're faster and stronger and tougher than regular humans, so it's helpful to have an edge.)
-   In the _Supernatural_/_Lucifer_ crossover "Tripping Down the Rabbit Hole", Gabriel and Maze discover that someone has brought a collection of angel blades from Gabriel's world to Lucifer's, prompting Gabriel to speculate that someone is using these to forge angel-killing bullets.

Films — Live-Action

-   _Transformers Film Series_:
    -   The "6000-degree magnesium burn" of "high-heat 105mm sabot rounds" fired from an AC-130 gunship allowed the US military to hurt the marauding Decepticons in the movie (it's not much, but it works rather better than normal bullets). Discarding-sabot rounds being neither hot, magnesium-laden or used by AC-130s, this has little to do with military practice or actual physics, though it is implied that weapons technology in the movie-verse is different because many human technological advancements came from studying Megatron's body.
    -   By the second movie, the human NEST teams are shown carrying heavily-upgraded, large-caliber assault rifles and machineguns that can actually inflict damage on Decepticons; the NEST units and Marines fighting the Decepticons at the end of the movie prove surprisingly effective against the Decepticons in the all-out battle that results.
    -   By the third film, a number of key Decepticons are taken down _without_ any help from Autobots beyond the training shown earlier in the film.
    -   By the time the fourth film rolls around, a rogue anti-Cybertronian organization has used trained soldiers and new tech to exterminate most Cybertronians on Earth.
-   In _Posse_, Jesse Lee has some of the stolen gold recast into golden bullets he intends to use on his father's killers. Father Time explains that, according to New Orleans voodoo ladies, gold is the only way to kill a demon. In Jesse's case, the demons are symbolic rather than actual.
-   The shells for the _Götterdämmerung_'s main gun in _Iron Sky_ are said to be made from metastable metallic hydrogen. They are powerful enough to tear our huge chunks of the Moon with each shot.
-   _The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms_: The only way to safely kill the beast. Its blood carries a deadly virus from prehistoric times, so shooting it will only cause the disease to spread and kill even more people, so in the end it's shot with a rifle grenade loaded with a potent radioactive isotope, causing it to die of radiation poisoning, which also neutralizes the disease it carries.

Literature

-   _Hammer's Slammers_: there's all sorts of strange weapons and ammo. One example is the "osmium penetrator" used by some of the other merc companies. These weapons take a rod of osmium, put behind it roughly a liter of propellant, and force it down a diamond-coated barrel to flechette thickness. It emerges as an osmium needle well capable of getting through tank armor, though it has little effect on personnel (the needle just blasts through people as if they weren't there, and since it doesn't splash, it just makes a very small hole). And powerguns, that fire _bolts of energy_ from polyurethane wafers as ammo.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   Kincaid at one point uses Dragonsbreath shotgun rounds to turn his disposable shotguns into flamethrowers. This inspires Harry to read up on _other_ unusual shotgun rounds, including flares.
    -   Dresden also keeps around some _actual_ depleted uranium, in powder form, because it apparently has spiritual as well as physical weight and can dispel ghosts.
-   _The Alloy of Law_: Anti-Allomancer rounds. The expensive ones are made out of Aluminum, the cheap ones vary based on target: Coinshot rounds are fronted with ceramics that will keep going when they push on the metal, Lurcher rounds contain ceramics surrounded by metal and fragment when pulled, Tineye rounds are excessively loud, Thug rounds are enormously over-sized.
-   In Sergey Lukyanenko's _Night Watch (Series)_, most of the stuff mentioned above is useless against vampires (in fact, they deliberately let Muggles think it works). Even silver doesn't kill them, though being shot with a Silver Bullet hurts like hell. What's deadly against a vampire? Vodka. Luckily most of the novels take place in Russia, where vodka is everywhere.
-   The Confederation military in _The Night's Dawn Trilogy_ is initially ineffective when fighting the Possessed except through massive overkill due to the Possessed scrambling nearby high-tech equipment and their sheer durability. The military eventually discover that the Possessed are crippled by large amounts of (static) electricity, and develop bullets with internal capacitors for fighting off the Possessed.
-   In _Ancillary Justice_, the bullets fired by the Garseddai guns will, after impact, go through _anything_ for exactly 1.11 meters, by simply creating as much energy as they need. In the third book it is revealed that the 1.11 meters were just a side effect of their even more exotic intended function of specifically destroying Radchaai ships while not being able to harm the guns’ Presger creators.
-   _The Fall of the House of Cabal_: The Red Queen equips her Praetorian Guard with ammunition that immolates vampires from the inside out, ostensibly because they contain holy water. Unbeknownst to them, the contents are neither holy nor water, and are costly in a way beyond financial expense.

Live-Action TV

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   For UNIT's final appearance in the old version, following an absence of some years, it is shown that they got tired of facing Immune to Bullets menaces and developed special bullets to even the playing field. These include teflon-coated armor-piercing rounds for robots and Daleks ("A non-stick bullet?" the Doctor muses<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ), high-explosive rounds for Yetis, gold-tipped bullets for Cybermen, and silver bullets just in case. The silver bullets turn out to be very useful.
    -   This continues in the new series, where UNIT uses rad-steel coated bullets to counter the Sontarans' anti-bullet field (that expands the copper casing of normal rounds and stops the guns firing).
    -   In "Revenge of the Cybermen", the Doctor mentions the "glittergun", which turns Cybermen into gold-plated statues as it clogs their vents.
-   In _Kamen Rider Kuuga_, a particularly persistent Monster of the Week (introduced in episode 2, finally offed in episode 39, though he doesn't appear in every episode) winds up getting its corpse analyzed to create special ammunition that can actually affect Grongi.
-   In _Supernatural_, Crowley manages to make angel-killing bullets by melting down angel blades.
-   In _Kamen Rider OOO_, Kamen Rider Birth uses a gun which fires Cell Medals at Yummies. Given that the term phlebotinum seems to be a play on phlebotomy (drawing of blood), and that Yummies (and the Greeed who created them) tend to "bleed" Cell Medals, this seems to be a fairly direct invocation.
-   At one point in _V: The Final Battle_, the heroes discover that Visitor body armor is now impervious to conventional bullets. Teflon-coated bullets solve this problem rather quickly.
-   In _Falling Skies_, the alien mechs can't be damaged by conventional bullets. Bullets made from salvaged mech armor, however, are quite effective.
-   In _Luke Cage (2016)_, Luke Cage is Immune to Bullets, except for the Judas, which is a line of special bullets designed by Hammer Industries and engineered from salvaged Chitauri metals.

Tabletop Games

-   _Warhammer 40,000_ has several examples, like Hellfire rounds, shells filled with a mutagenic acid that causes a near-instant and very painful death to anybody unfortunate enough to get hit by one, Dragonfire shells, which explode in a burst of superheated gas and Kraken bolts, which contain cores made of Thunderbolt Iron.
-   In _GURPS Ogre_, the standard anti-personnel round is "ap-fizz dizzy-doo" (APFSDSDU): armor-piercing, fin-stabilized, discarding sabot, depleted uranium.

Video Games

-   _Resident Evil_ games traditionally feature acid grenades and fire grenades in addition to normal grenade rounds. The precise effects of these specialized rounds varies from game to game. Acid grenades tend to be more effective against B.O.W type enemies, such as the Hunters in _Resident Evil_ and the Lickers in _Resident Evil 2_. Fire grenades can be used to burn up zombies (before or after they are "killed") to prevent them from becoming Crimson Heads in REMake, whilst in RE2, they can One-Hit Kill Ivies (and their range means they're a far better choice for doing so than Leon's flamethrower).
    -   _Resident Evil 3: Nemesis_ adds freeze grenades to the normal/acid/fire trinity; these freeze enemies solid with one hit, allowing Jill to smash the enemy to pieces with a single normal bullet. Nemesis himself is especially weak to them.
    -   _Resident Evil – Code: Veronica_ also features single pickup of three anti-BOW gas rounds alongside its normal/acid/fire grenades. A hit from one of these gas grenades **halves** the health of the enemy struck, including _bosses_; needless to say, they make tough bosses much easier to face.
-   The titular enemies from _Metroid_ are typically weak to ice.
-   The tail end of _Parasite Eve_ features bullets laced with the protagonist's mitochondria. And that's not even touching the fact that the game's main feature is elite gun tweaking to make bullets that freeze, burn, tranquilize, or poison with acid and cyanide. (Then there's the crazy things the guns themselves can do, barring the already-powerful-enough rocket launchers.)
-   _Chex Quest_: Originally the flemoids/phlemoids (Whichever you prefer) were immune to conventional weapons. However, the "Zorcher" works by remodulating the dimensional frequencies of the creatures, sending them back to whatever realm they came from. Therefore, no killing the... green... slimy mucus things that want to eat the main character alive, and Ta-Da! It's kid-friendly!
-   _BioShock_ has ammo for weapons ranging from (relatively) realistic things like armour piercing bullets to things like electric shotgun shells, exploding shotgun shells, a flamethrower that also fires liquid nitrogen and electric gel, and a crossbow with fire bolts and bolts that shoot wires. And then there's plasmids...
-   _Stars! (1995)_ has depleted **neutronium** ammo — presumably, dense far beyond the bounds of normal matter. (How you deplete neutronium is unknown to modern science.)
-   _Jagged Alliance 2_ v1.13: introduced AET (Advanced Energy Transfer) ammunition. They pierce armor better than standard armor-piercing (AP) rounds, and do more damage as well (though less than hollow-point (HP) rounds). They're also extremely expensive and wear down guns faster than any other ammunition in the game, as otherwise you would never use any other type of ammunition. The developers suggest not thinking too hard about how that works.
    -   On a more realistic level, there's also Glaser ammunition (G), which causes the absolute most damage possible to an unarmored opponent, but can't even hurt someone wearing even a basic flak jacket, only doing (surprisingly minor) stamina damage instead, with the added benefit of also preventing overpenetration (the bullet won't pass through your target and hit someone or something behind it). Glaser ammunition is almost overpowered at the beginning of the game, when most enemies you fight are unarmored, and almost completely useless by the middle of the game on, when enemies start wearing at least basic armor<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . But the fun of doing 130 points of damage with a headshot in a game where the maximum health is 100 (and most units don't even have that) cannot be overstated.
-   _Singularity_: is powered up with the time-warping abilities of "Element 99". Some of the weapons have special abilities because of this (like a sniper rifle that slows down time so you can shoot a moving target) but for most, it just makes their bullets hit harder.
-   _Ninja Gaiden_: when Ryu used APFSDS cores as _arrows_, to destroy heavily armored _tanks and helicopters_. But then, that whole section of the game is an exercise in Refuge in Audacity. There are also explosive arrows for when getting through armour is less important than AOE.
-   In _StarCraft_, the "U-238 Shells" upgrade swaps out the standard Terran Marine rifle round for one made from depleted uranium. This increases Marines' attack range by 25%.
-   Railgun rounds in _Escape Velocity Nova_ are stated in flavor text to be forged of metals that are highly conductive but cheap, such as copper and gold. The rounds come in 100, 150, 200, and (with the ARPIA plug-in) 400 millimeter sizes.
-   _The Godfather 2_ has incendiary rounds as a reward for completing a certain crime ring.
-   _X-COM: Apocalypse_:
    -   The ultimate anti-alien weapons are anti-alien toxins and anti-alien gas. The former requires a special pistol and has to be upgraded twice to be effective against advanced forms, the latter is discovered fairly late, but can be used in grenades and missiles for existing launchers. Both completely bypass aliens' force field shields and pose almost no threat whatsoever to allied forces in the event of psionic attack. With those the last missions are a breeze. You still need conventional weapons, explosives or rayguns to disable alien structures, though. Good thing you can borrow them from dead aliens.
    -   Equally, it takes multiple disruptor blasts or devastator missiles to take down _your_ troopers at that stage, thanks to your Nigh-Invulnerable disruption armor and stolen shield technology... and then the aliens bust out _their_ enzyme guns, which shoot target-seeking organic "missiles" loaded with nasty stuff that can melt through your super-armor in seconds. They may still be stopped by shields, but the moment you see them on the field, you take notice.
-   _XCOM: Enemy Unknown_ has a basic upgrade in the form of Reaper Rounds, which can only be used in projectile weapons and are developed based on the initial research of alien alloys. They _tend_ to hit harder than regular rounds (higher chance of critical hit), but also tend to fly less reliably than regular rounds (lower chance to hit).
    -   The sequel _XCOM 2_ introduced a wide variety of alternative rounds. Toxic rounds poison enemies. Hellfire rounds can light them on fire. Talon rounds pack a huge punch (higher critical chance _and_ critical damage). But the most commonly sought and used rounds are Bluescreen rounds, which cause extensive damage to robotic enemies, and also completely ignore any armor said robotic enemies may be using. With 4 out of the 5 most powerful enemies in the game vulnerable to Bluescreen rounds<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and frequently decked out in a lot of armor to boot, Bluescreen rounds are worth their weight in gold.
-   _Evolve_ has super material rounds, or super-mat for short. How they work exactly isn't explained, but a super-mat pistol packs enough of a punch for a multi-story tall monster to take notice.
-   _Earth & Beyond_ had Projectile (read: bullets) and Missile ammunition (as well as beams) that came in a wide variety of flavors, each of which behaved differently and was effective against different targets. It did at least try to be "realistic" by limiting which damage types could fit into which ammunition. Damage types were: Impact, Explosive, Energy, Plasma, Chemical, and EMP. Impact Explosive and Energy were the basic type that did instant upfront damage equally on all targets; no Impact/Explosive Beams, Explosive Projectiles, or Energy Missiles existed with only 1 extremely rare Energy Projectile existing. Plasma and Chemical each did DoT with Plasma doing extra damage to metal hulls and Chemical doing extra damage to organic Space Whales; all weapons could fire Plasma ammo, but there were no chemical Beams. EMP did extra damage to shields and Scratch Damage to anything else; only 1 rare EMP Projectile existed but were common for Beams and Missiles.
-   _Corpse Killer_ has Datura bullets, made by soaking regular or armor-piercing bullets in a brew of ground-up Datura leaves, which is especially potent against zombie poison. You also need them to damage the game's Elite Mooks.

-   Jack Yaeger's gun in _The Mercury Men_ fires bullets made of solid light, apparently the only thing that can kill the Mercury men.

Western Animation

-   In _Centurions_, energy specialist Rex Charger had assault weapon systems that fired missiles that contained... energy-changing stuff. Magnetic shields, light, energy that was absorbed by a gun—the missiles were Technobabble shells. This meant that they were exactly as powerful as the plot demanded: on separate occasions, Rex blew up a Swirly Energy Thingy and _killed a black hole._

Real Life

-   The Trope Namer, Depleted Uranium Sabots. Not only do they one-up the usual materials used for tank shells, such as steel and tungsten in terms of density, and thus potential kinetic energy, it's also self-sharpening and pyrophoric, meaning while conventional steel or tungsten rounds blunt as they dig into armor, Depleted Uranium melts in a pattern that keeps it sharp, and when it penetrates, it drags all that molten metal along with it into the innards of its target. It also happens to be slightly radioactive, and a toxic compound, but those are largely irrelevant (Until after the conflict is over, when DU rounds will be found to have caused adverse long-term health effects to both the adversaries they're shot at and the friendly soldiers handling them).
