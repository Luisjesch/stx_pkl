"How is it possible I want to punch you more **now** than before you apologized?"

_"I said it's too late to apologize."_

Bob did something terrible to Alice. He feels guilty, so he gives her a sincere apology. However, Alice won't have it. She doesn't care about the apology. Whether Bob's actions were that bad or Alice is just a plain Jerkass who holds grudges, she refuses to forgive him.

This results from someone holding a grudge that they refuse to let go of. Unfortunately, this can make out someone who has a rightful reason to be angry into a cruel person if the apologizing party is sincerely guilty for their actions. On the other hand, it may not take away much, if any sympathy at all if the person who's apologizing has committed wicked deeds that were too numerous or too horrible to deserve forgiveness, and in extreme cases can even make the _apologizer_ look like a total, selfish jerk for thinking one sorry is enough to make up for a lifetime of atrocities, especially if said "apology" was disproportionate and half-hearted. There are times when even the apologies themselves could be an even bigger insult than the original offense, especially if they believe a single apology will undo all damages. It could even be the victim knows the person is only apologizing because they are trying to convince the victim not to punish them for their actions and the person isn't honestly sorry for what they did.

In a rare occurrence, sometimes the rejected apology was coerced by outside parties. In the event of this, the one apologizing is shown as more sympathetic due to receiving harsh treatment from both sides and the rejecter is portrayed as even more jerkish and completely unreasonable, however fair that may be. In some cases, however, the fact that the apology was clearly enforced and not sincere is exactly _why_ it was rejected. In really tearjerking occasions, the incident that led to the rejecter being angry was a complete misunderstanding, but the rejecter refuses to listen to or maybe even believe the apologizing party's explanation. In more extreme cases, the rejecter might even turn down the apology while on the rejecter’s deathbed to deliberately spite the one apologizing with Parting-Words Regret.

The opposite of Redemption Rejection, where the one who did wrong is offered a chance to be forgiven, but he turns it down. A super trope of Reformed, but Rejected. An extreme version of this trope is Heel–Face Door-Slam, which happens if rejecting an apology also involves killing the offender. Contrast Easily Forgiven, where it's a character forgiving those who don't apologize for their actions. Sometimes, the victim gives a Flippant Forgiveness, where the victim accepts their offender's apology in a sarcastic, insulting way. If the character does accept their apology but is still upset by their actions, then it's Forgiven, but Not Forgotten. Contrast The Unapologetic, where the wrongdoer refuses to apologize (for this case, having their apology rejected or knowing that it will be rejected by the other party can be a reason why they refuse to apologize, especially if they know deep down they're not truly sorry for what they've done). See No Sympathy for Grudgeholders where this may or may _not_ be a fitting response to the character's lack of forgiveness. This can often be part of the "The Reason You Suck" Speech if the rejection is extremely harsh. Virtue Is Weakness might come to play in that the rejecter might see forgiveness as a sign of weakness. If the apologizer acts equally standoffish and recants their apology after being rejected (either due to arrogantly expecting forgiveness or hypocrisy on the refuser's end), Then Let Me Be Evil is what they may commit. Often found in many Downer Endings, and few Bittersweet Endings.

Sadly, this is Truth in Television — whether or not the offender is truly regretful or that the person who was offended has always held on to grudges.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Played With to "Denied Permission to Feel Remorse" in _Attack on Titan_ with the main character Eren and his rigid views of morality. When Reiner expresses guilt for his crimes, it only enrages Eren even further, since he sees him as a monster who isn't allowed to feel remorse. It takes Eren four years time, with him learning the truth about the world, about Marley, and the entire context behind why the Warrior trio destroyed Wall Maria in the first place within those four years, before he can finally forgive Reiner.
-   In _Bloom Into You_, Sayaka Saeki had a Gay Romantic Phase with Chie Yuzuki, her sempai from middle school, until Chie suddenly broke off their relationship one day, saying that they were getting too old for it. When the two met by chance while Sayaka was in high school, Chie apologized for getting Sayaka interested in girls and hoped that she had gone back to normal. Sayaka then tells Chie that she shouldn't worry, since she doesn't know why she got interested in Chie in the first place, an outwardly polite remark that expresses that she has not forgiven Chie.
-   _Digimon_:
    -   Dub Text in _Digimon Tamers_ final episode (and a bit of Lost in Translation). When the Juggernaut program that was used to defeat the D-Reaper forces the Digimon to return to the digital world, Henry's dad, who knew it would happen, asks him if he can forgive him, and Henry sadly shakes his head. (In the original, the head shake meant "don't worry about it").
    -   There's also _Digimon Adventure 02_, where Osamu Ichijouji does this to his little brother Ken after having caught him using the Digivice they found without his permission (the digivice _belonged_ to Ken, but neither of the brothers knew this). Eventually, this causes Ken to snap that he wishes for him to disappear, and his wish came true when Osamu got run over by a car.
-   Despite popular belief, Kouta did _not_ accept Lucy's apology at the end of _Elfen Lied_. Understandable, since what she is apologizing for is basically _the murder of his sister and father_. While he _does_ say that he cannot hate Lucy, he just can't forgive that she killed his family or condone her actions as a whole.
-   Inverted in _Fruits Basket_. When Kyo admits to Tohru that he failed to save her mother Kyoko, she refuses to say "I _don't_ forgive you". Strangely enough, he takes this worse than if she had rejected his apology, since he feels like she _shouldn't_ forgive him for it because Kyoko apparently didn't. The penultimate chapter reveals that Kyoko was actually warning him to keep his promise to look after Tohru if anything happened to her, but she was only able to say she wouldn't forgive him.
-   _Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story_: Before meeting Kuro, Kuroe is shown rejecting someone's texted apology twice before blocking them, although it's never explored what the other person actually did.
-   _Monster Musume_: Smith apologizes to Rachnera for placing her with a family that didn't fully accept her, but Rachnera brushes it off while saying her negligence and inconsideration of her needs was what got her into that mess, adding that the coordinator's apology had no sincerity to it.
-   _My Hero Academia_: Endeavor is an Abusive Parent who sees the errors of his ways and attempts to apologize to his family for what he has done. Out of them, Natsuo vocally refuses to acknowledge that apology, while Shoto is more or less neutral to it, unable to forget all that his father has done, but acknowledging that he's a great hero and that people can change. Then there’s his eldest son, who became the mass-murdering villain Dabi. Endeavor attempts an apology to him but Dabi is having none of it and is basically out to destroy society as a whole along with the rest of the final villains.
-   Discussed in _My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!_'s spinoff manga _On the Verge of Doom!_. When Catarina comes to Mary for advice on how to properly apologize to Keith for all the things she did to him before her Past-Life Memories awoke, Mary tells her that as someone who was also bullied by older siblings her entire life, she would find it extremely difficult to even consider such an apology. She turns out to be completely right, as Keith becomes _furious_ when Catarina tries to apologize to him and calls him "little brother" after years of treating him like dirt.
-   In _One Piece_, the Straw Hat crew's ship Going Merry was beyond repair and Luffy came to the conclusion to discard it and buy a new ship. Usopp, who was injured by their former-enemy-later-crewmate Franky, objects to the idea and insists on keeping it, thus an argument breaks out. In a fit of anger, Luffy says that if Usopp won't accept his decision, he can just leave, leading Sanji to kick him in the face and demand that Luffy think before he speaks. Luffy comes to his senses and apologizes, but the damage was done, and therefore, Usopp refuses to accept his apology and walks out on the crew.
-   In _A Place Further than the Universe_, the reason Hinata had to drop out of school is because she'd been picked to run for her team over some of the third-years, apparently at her friends' urging, and when said third-years got angry, her friends betrayed her, spreading rumors about her and forcing her to leave. When her friends send a message to the Antarctic expedition acting like nothing's wrong and that they're still friends, Hinata is extremely upset, although she tries to hide it. Eventually, when pressed, Hinata admits that she doesn't want to see them act relieved if she forgives them, prompting Shirase to give them a "The Reason You Suck" Speech on her behalf.
-   In the Feud Episode of _Sailor Moon Super S_, Minako ruins the decorations of Chibiusa's school's cultural festival, Makoto is so hurt that she angrily breaks off their friendship and refuses to accept her apology. They do make up, though.
-   _The Summer You Were There_: Five years before the start of the series, Shizuku bullied her classmate Ruri, making cutting remarks about the latter's frequent absences from school (which caused her to lag behind her classmates in athletics and academics) and eventually pushing her while she was carrying curry, causing Shizuku to be ostracized as a bully. During the main story, Shizuku, at the urging of her "girlfriend" and Ruri's friend Kaori, drafts an apology letter and meets with Ruri to give it to her in person. Ruri politely tells Shizuku that the trauma from Shizuku's bullying has never gone away, and she wants nothing more to do with Shizuku. Shizuku, despite having hoped Ruri would forgive her, understands that Ruri suffered more and accepts her decision. Later on, though, Ruri sees that Shizuku has changed and hopes to get to know her better- not because she's forgiven her but in the hopes that doing so can help her get over her trauma.

    Comic Books 

-   _Action Comics_: At the climax of _The Black Ring_, Lex Luthor has achieved Enlightenment Superpowers and genuinely made the universe into a better place. And all he has to do to keep them is _stop hating Superman_. When Superman realises this, he desperately apologises for anything he's done that ever upset Luthor, but that only makes him angrier.
-   In the graphic novel _Kelly Green_ 1 _The Go Between_ by Leonard Starr and Stan Drake, Kelly is kneeling beside the dying body of her husband's killer It was Dan Green's partner Angie who ask her to forgive him. She asked if he believes in God; when he affirms as much, she declares that means he can go to Hell and walks away.
-   Variation in _Legacy_. Darth Wyyrlok says that he isn't going to apologize for trying to murder Darth Krayt. Krayt replied that he wouldn't accept any apologies, either. A duel to the death ensues.
-   _Loki: Agent of Asgard_: In issue 10, Loki finally confessed and tried to apologize for what they did in _Journey into Mystery (Gillen)_ (murdered and body-snatched their own child self), and Thor understandably snapped, and barely restrained himself from killing him. Tragically, Loki not only meant it but knew that he deserved every bit of what he got, not lifting a finger to fight back.
-   When things go _very_ wrong in _Lucifer_ as Fenris' plan to destroy everything seems like it will succeed, a dying Michael begs Lucifer to forgive him for everything that's happened between them. Lucifer refuses... because Lucifer blames his _own_ mistakes for this. As far as he's concerned, none of this is Michael's fault.
-   A pretty realistic example with Spider-Man's Aunt May was at first unwilling to forgive the Vulture when he pleaded for forgiveness for killing her boyfriend Nathan Lubinski. (He was dying, and sought to tie up loose ends.) His first attempt ended with her slapping him and ordering him to leave (he did, but not for long). When it was clear that his remorse was heavily tainted with hypocrisy (he had also committed several murders as part of tying up "the loose ends") Spidey beat him to a pulp, dragged him back to May's house, and _made_ him apologize for everything he did. May still didn't accept it. She dealt with her inner pain eventually, and visited him in jail, where she stated that she wasn't unwilling to understand, she couldn't bring herself to forgive him, simply saying it was between him and God. (Unfortunately, future stories showed it was lost on him.)
-   Lian Harper died in _Justice League: Cry for Justice_ during the earthquake which levelled most of Star City thanks to Prometheus's malfunctioning teleporter, as a result of being left alone by Speedy (Mia Dearden) while she went to fight the Electrocutioner. The follow-up series _Rise of Arsenal_ shows Mia trying to apologize to Roy Harper at Lian's burial, which results in him trying to strangle her as he calls her out on leaving Lian when she did. While this is meant to be shown as Roy Jumping Off the Slippery Slope in his descent into bloody antiheroism, it's hard not to sympathize considering Mia chose the worst possible time and place to ask Roy to forgive her for the role she played, unintentional or not, in his child's very violent death.

    Fan Works 

### Crossovers

-   _All For Luz_:
    -   When girl called Natasha tries to say sorry to Luz for not defending her from her bullies out of peer pressure when they tried to be friends back in middle school, Luz rejects it saying an apology from her is not wanted or needed.
    -   When her cousin Riley tries to apologise for trying to kill her on the Wittebanes' orders as she was about to surrender to the cops peacefully and explain why she did, Luz is having none of it. She blames Riley for the carnage that transpire today that arose from that betrayal, including her mother's murder, steals her Quirk and proceeds to kill her with it.
        
        **Riley**: Luz... I... I know y-you're probably very, very mad at me... but you have to understand that I w-wasn’t given a choice...  
        **Luz**: Shut up. This is your fault... all of this. Everything that happened today... It was all on **you**. So do me a favour, and _**die**_.
        
-   _Bring Me to Life_: Following a rather vicious argument, Buffy tries apologizing to Faith. Part of the reason why Faith rejects it is because Buffy herself admits that part of her didn't even _want_ to apologize and that Angel talked her into trying.
-   In _God is Cruel_, Oliver uses Laurel as bait for Slade without her knowledge. Slade uses the setup to stab Laurel in the stomach, nearly killing her. A horrified Oliver tries to apologize to Dean, Laurel's husband, who will have none of it.
    
    **Oliver:** I'm sorry.  
    **Dean:** _(mockingly)_ You're sorry? You're _sorry_? You think that's enough? You think that's anywhere close to being enough? Sorry isn't going to save her life. Sorry isn't going to fix everything you've broken.
    
-   _Charles Manson Vs The Teletubbies_:
    
    Shin Charles Manson was breathing heavily now, the fight had clearly taken a lot out of him so the Teletubbies decided to end this now.  
    "Wait, please don't kill me" pleaded Shin Charles Manson.  
    He then reached into his pocket and pulled out the tubby custard that he stole.  
    "You can have this back, just please let me go"  
    Tinky Winky then stepped forward and said "you forfeited your right to live the very second you disrespected the sacred tubby custard." The other 3 Teletubbies nodded their heads in agreement.  
    The Teletubbies then took their weapons and combined them into one mega weapon. They aimed it at Shin Charles Manson's stupid face.  
    "TELETUBBY LAZER STRIKE" yelled the Teletubbies before a pink and blue beam exited from their weapon and set its sights on Shin Charles Manson.  
    The laser hit Charles in the chest and created a huge fiery explosion with him at the very center of it all. Charles screamed in terror as his body was burned to a crisp and he turned to ashes.  
    The tubby custard was still fine because tubby custard is the purest substance in Teletubby land and cannot be destroyed, only consumed.  
    The Teletubbies then walked over to Charles burnt corpse and picked up their tubby custard from the flames.  
    They then resumed eating their tasty snack knowing that all was right in Teletubby land once again.
    
-   _Infinity Train: Branching Paths_:
    -   In _Parker II_, Parker refuses to accept that Yeardley's apology for how he bullied Chloe is sincere; after all, if he was capable of remorse, why would he have bullied her in the first place? UnChloe gets him to reconsider by asking Parker whether he'd regret it if his attempt to get revenge accidentally killed Yeardley, helping him recognize that it's fully possible for somebody to regret causing others unintended harm.
    -   Downplayed during _Ash V_: While Ash never outright rejects Parker's apologies, he realizes that his volatile temper and the toxic environment that Vermillion has become convince him to leave the city.
-   A rather common occurrence in _The Night Unfurls_.
    -   During the Feoh/Ur Arc, Alicia surrendered to the Black Dogs and their army, allowing them to take over the fortresses. Among the victims are a number of nuns, including Lily. When the two meet in Chapter 9 and Alicia apologises for her actions, she receives a slap in the face from Lily, saying that she will never forgive Alicia for leaving her sisters to their fates.
    -   Before that, she also apologised to Prim for the same thing, because those nuns were Prim's friends. This leads to a downplayed example where Prim patiently states that there is nothing to forgive, though she acknowledges that the Black Dogs have pressured her cousin to surrender.
    -   Prior to the story, Olga sacrificed a city to the orcs to recruit them and augment her forces to fight Celestine, leading to Grace losing her home and husband. While Olga tries to make amends with Grace at the end of Chapter 20, Grace explicitly states that if she were Sir Kyril, she would not hesitate to kill her, and hopes that he would do the same if he knew what happened.
-   _Raise Your Voice Against Liars_:
    -   When Lila publicly apologizes to Marinette, she calls her out on trying to ruin her life out of pettiness and spite, declaring that she will never forgive her.
    -   She then rejects her classmates, asking whether they actually _mean_ it or just want everything to go back to how it was. She points out how easily they could have debunked Lila's claims by simply looking into them; instead, they turned against her. If they want to be friends again, they'll have to rebuild their relationships over time, rather than expecting a few hollow words to magically fix everything.
    -   She similarly rejects Adrien's apology, calling him out for claiming he was going to support her, only to turn a blind eye to everything that was happening.
-   _Spiders and Magic: Rise of Spider-Mane_: Princess Celestia attempts to offer an olive branch to The Dazzlings; however, as she's apologizing for attempting a genocidal purge of their entire race, they reject her efforts.

### _Arrowverse_

-   In _Echoes of the past_, Oliver tries to apologize to Laurel for his terrible treatment of her. However, she cuts him off and tells him that if he needed to be told how much he hurt her and is going to continue to treat her terribly, he shouldn't bother. So he doesn't apologize, which _really_ wasn't what she wanted to happen. Later she repeats this to him, and he _does_ apologize. But by that point, it's too late.
-   _moral of the story (Nyame)_: After being resurrected, Laurel rejects Oliver's attempts to make amends, as he not only caused her to commit suicide but also caused her to lose her sister again, as her death caused Sara to self herself back to the League of Assassins just for the opportunity to use the Lazarus Pit to bring Laurel back to life. Instead, she opts to throw him out of her life permanently and leave Starling altogether to start afresh in Gotham.
-   _What It Takes_:
    -   At the end of the story, Quentin tries to apologize for his actions to Laurel. Seeing as these actions include outing her as the Black Canary, hunting her down with his officers, and issuing a shoot-on-sight order on her in order to please an _international terrorist_ (whom Laurel, Oliver, and even Sara told him not to trust), in addition to the years of emotional abuse and heartbreak he's already put her through, she understandably does not accept his apology, and cuts him out of her life for good.
    -   Subverted with Oliver and Laurel. While Laurel does accept his apology for his previous bad treatment of her, she doesn't accept his apology for leaving, because she doesn't begrudge him for taking his chance at a relationship with Felicity (who everyone, even him, thought he was in love with at the time) and because he probably did need the break after everything that happened the past year.

### _Avatar: The Last Airbender_

-   After the Agni Kai and ousting Zuko from the position of Fire Lord in _Towards the Sun_, Iroh gets on his knees and begs for Zuko's forgiveness. Zuko doesn't remotely forgive Iroh for undermining him, undoing his efforts as Fire Lord, and making him relive his worst trauma. He doesn't even think that Iroh is being sincere.

### _Danganronpa_

-   _Blackened Skies_: After Kaede's plan to draw out the culprit during the first trial nearly causes the group to falsely convict Tsumugi instead, the seamstress is naturally among those who reject her apology. Kaede tries to make amends, hoping to mend fences quickly, only for Tsumugi to call her out on it, pointing out that she's not giving her _time_ to process what happened, and the pushiness isn't helping her case any.
-   _Danganronpa 2/3 Redux: Return Unto Death_: One of the motives Monokuma reveals in Chapter 3 involves a False Rape Accusation against Kazuichi's father. When the participant involved in this incident attempts to apologize to the other student involved, they reject it entirely.
-   In _Where Talent Goes to Die_, when Kaori Miura, the protagonist, is being considered for admission to Talent High School (a school very similar to Hope's Peak Academy), she's pitted against Shiro Kurogane, the Ultimate Shogi Player in a shogi match and, thanks to her talent, defeats him despite never having played before. Kurogane is quite bitter about the humiliation he suffered and refuses to accept Miura's apology when they're trapped in the school together. This results in Kurogane being murdered, and his killer trying to frame Miura for his death. Averted in Kurogane's Free Time Events, though, in which he does eventually accept Miura's apology, and admit that he's been unfair to her.

### _Fire Emblem_

-   In _Corrin in Peril_, Corrin ends up being captured and enslaved by her Nohrian siblings and their retainers, who have become cartoonishly evil in this fic. When Corrin talks back to Charlotte, she summons Leo, Odin and Laslow, who proceed to beat Corrin up after she tries to apologize, with Leo saying "SORRY DOESN'T CUT IT!" At the end of the fic, when Corrin's Hoshidan siblings come to her rescue, Laslow, who is at Ryoma's mercy, tries to apologize, only for Ryoma to tell him, "Sorry doesn't cut it, scum!" Ryoma stabs Laslow with Raijinto and Takumi finishes him off.

### _Fullmetal Alchemist_

-   In _Phylactery_, Greed refuses to forgive Envy for an incident hundreds of years ago where Envy accidentally killed one of Greed's friends while disguised as Greed. Greed took Envy's theft of one of his "possessions" really hard, and Envy, who'd previously looked up to Greed, masked his confusion and hurt at being rejected with anger and scorn; it's the reason behind their constant fighting. Justified, since Envy never sincerely apologized or even felt bad for stabbing Greed's friend. He just expected to be forgiven. Because a stupid human couldn't really be that important to Greed,could she?

### _Girls und Panzer_

-   In _Girls und Panzer - International War Games_, Hisao visits his son Kenji, the main Original Character, trying to get Kenji to stop blaming himself for a past incident (presumably when Kenji accidentally killed his sister). Hisao admits that he was too hard on Kenji, something that also applies to Kenji's older brother, but Kenji doesn't believe it. Unusually for this trope, Hisao turns far less conciliatory and calls Kenji out on not accepting his apology.

### _Harry Potter_

-   In _Brutal Harry_, Dumbledore tries to apologize to Harry for leaving him with the Dursleys and Harry won't hear any of it, as the subsequent abuse he underwent at their hands goes beyond anything that could be forgiven within reason. Moreover, Harry also calls out Dumbledore on being a hypocrite for apologizing for the abuse Harry went through, yet still enabling the exact same environment to occur in Hogwarts via turning a blind eye to the bullying problems and corrupt staff plaguing the school. The sequel, _Hero Harry_, reveals that Harry still hasn't forgiven the man and likely never will.
-   _A Cadmean Victory_: Harry does this twice, rejecting Ron's attempt to apologize for turning his back on him when he mistakenly believed that Harry had put his name in the Goblet of Fire, and Hermoine's apology for accidentally breaking his wand.
-   _The Peace Not Promised_: After Snape proves his loyalty and commitment to the cause, James and Remus attempt to reconcile their differences, only to find that Snape's not interested. The only reason he treats them with anything resembling civility is due to Lily's influence.

### _Hetalia: Axis Powers_

### _The Loud House_

-   In _Losing Him_, Lincoln rejects his family's attempt to apologize for kicking him out of the house and selling his things, as their casual cruelty wound up getting him _shot_.
-   _A Night To Forget_: After Luna, Luan, Lynn, and Lucy all arrange four different dates for their brother to take to the Sadie Hawkins dance, they guilt-trip him into trying to juggle all four without anyone finding out. When this completely ruins the night and his reputation, with all of the girls _and_ Ronnie Anne convinced he was stringing them all along, Lincoln angrily rejects Luna's attempt to apologize. It doesn't help that Lynn pushed him past his Rage Breaking Point by accusing him of _bailing_ when he first got home, failing to notice that he'd been beaten to heck and back.
-   _No Such Luck, No Such Love_:
    -   When Luna first attempts to apologize to Lincoln, he's still too angry to acknowledge her remorse, let alone accept her apology.
    -   When Lynn finally apologizes to Lincoln about blaming him for her loss, she unintentionally makes clear that she doesn't _really_ get what the problem was. Lincoln slaps her face in order to make a point about how saying "I'm sorry" doesn't magically erase the hurt.
    -   Discussed when Luna gets a drawing tablet for Lincoln, as she's worried that he'll see the gift as an attempt to _bribe_ him into forgiving her. To this end, she tries to figure out a way to give it to him without triggering an automatic rejection.
-   _Syngenesophobia_: Considering the severity of the sisters' crimes, this trope comes about.
    -   Played With; when the sisters visited Lincoln in Chapter 8 to apologize, Lincoln reacted with fear than actual anger. Earlier, this was Discussed earlier about what if Lincoln refuses to forgive them.
    -   This is Downplayed in Chapter 38, despite Becky and Mandee acknowledging Leni's remorse. Leni _still_ sent Lincoln to the hospital, and neither of the two wishes to hang out with her. They would only forgive Leni if Lincoln forgives her, however, Leni doesn't know if Lincoln _wants_ to forgive.
-   _What is a Person Worth?_:
    -   Downplayed, Lincoln points out to Lucy that considering everything she and the rest of the family put him through since the whole bad luck fiasco started, a mere "sorry" isn't good enough. To specify, he refuses to just hand over his family forgiveness on a silver platter and wants to have them _earn_ his forgiveness, and must be to _his_ satisfaction, not _theirs_. Chapter 10 reveals he's forgiving Lana and in Chapter 16, he finally forgives Leni, Luna, and Luan. Chapter 19 sees Lori making progress and as of Chapter 20, both the Loud parents have made big strides, though Rita's first steps were in chapter 18.
    -   Lynn's nightmare in Chapter 15 plays this to an extreme where she's the only person Lincoln will never forgive. She takes it badly, even after she realizes it was just a bad dream. And despite standing up for Lincoln in Chapter 22 when Ronnie believes Lincoln's cheating on her, Lynn seems to fully believe Lincoln's never going to forgive her.

### _Love Hina_

-   _Entering The Love Hina World_: After Tsuruko forces Motoko to have a Jerkass Realization about how she treated Keitaro and Anthony, Motoko attempts to apologize, only for them to assume that she was ordered to do so by her sister. Once they learn she's sincere, the boys make clear that while they might forgive her for how she hurt _them_, they can't forgive the way she's treated _others_, while Faye simply rejects her efforts outright and declares that everything she's done is completely unforgivable.

### _Miraculous Ladybug_

-   Commonly seen in post-"Chameleon" Salt Fics, such as this unnamed piece by ChaoticNeutral. Having had her warnings brushed off and dismissed, Marinette is unwilling to accept an apology that rings hollow — much less one that her classmates clearly _expect_ her to accept, no questions asked, and without any of them evaluating how they behaved.
-   _BURN THE WITCH_:
    -   Lila expects a few Crocodile Tears and a flimsy excuse will be enough to sway the soft-hearted Rose, even _after_ she was akumatized into Witch Hunter.
    -   Downplayed with Adrien, who during the course of the story has a Jerkass Realization about how badly he let his friends down by failing to warn anyone about Lila. Unlike Lila, he accepts that a simple apology won't be enough and he'll have to put in work to make amends. His classmates decide this is acceptable and leave the exact conditions up to Rose, since she suffered the most from Lila's manipulations.
-   _Burning Bridges, Building Confidence_: After Nino approaches Marinette and her Girl Posse to apologize, they hear him out, even offering advice on how to handle breaking up with Alya; however, they also make clear that he hasn't been fully forgiven, and that they're watching and waiting to see whether or not he's actually learned anything and is going to make any effort to change before they start truly forgiving him.
-   _Couturiere_: After recovering from being transformed into the titular akuma, Marinette takes a box of éclairs to Lila's place as an attempt to apologize for what she put her through. Lila stomps the box flat before slamming the door in her face.
-   _I See What You Do Behind Closed Doors_: After Lila's true nature is revealed, Mylene is the first to try apologizing to Marinette, claiming that there was _no way_ she could've known the truth. Marinette blandly reminds her and everyone else that she warned them. When the class then doubles down on insisting they're not to blame, Marinette decides that they're not worth forgiving — not while they're not only refusing to admit what they did wrong but are trying to convince _her_ that it's _her fault_ they dismissed her warnings as being fueled by petty jealousy.
-   _The Karma of Lies_ has this happen left and right when Marinette finally realizes that the way her classmates are treating her is not okay and puts her foot down. When her classmates try to apologize, she rejects their apologies and calls them out for obviously just wanting to get back on her good side now that everyone knows she's Ladybug rather than really being sorry for how they acted. Notably, Marinette _is_ willing to work with those who actually understand and admit what they were doing wrong and are putting in the work to change their behavior, even if she doesn't fully trust them yet. She only rejects apologies from people who obviously haven't learned anything and expect to be Easily Forgiven.
-   _The One to Make It Stay_: During _All the Laughs We Had in the Past_, Chloé gets akumatized and is responsible for the Black Cat Ring falling into Hawkmoth's hands.

-   In _Villains Are Destined to Die_, Penelope spent years being verbally abused by Reynald, who rejected her as an adopted sister. He even framed her for stealing a valuable necklace early on, which turned the rest of the household against her. Eventually she manages to face him and uses a combination of "The Reason You Suck" Speech, Armor-Piercing Question, and Did You Think I Can't Feel? to make him realize their "rivalry" was entirely one-sided, and she'd done nothing to earn his Irrational Hatred. It works, and instead of killing her as she feared, later on he offers an honest apology for all the harm he did. She calmly replies "I don't want it." The reason why is complicated, but it boils down to the fact that "Penelope" is actually Chia Seiyon, a Korean girl who has reincarnated into Penelope's similarly aged body. She thus considers that the apology should be given to the real or previous Penelope, and even though she herself suffered some amount of abuse by Reynold, she doesn't really care about fixing their relationship or even having one. This further spurs Reynold's character development, since from his POV he comes to think Penelope would rather cut ties with him and he resolves to do better.

However, she refuses to forgive them, and she forbids them from seeing their granddaughter ever again. On the partner's side, she's not willing to forgive them because she knows her in-laws never accepted their daughter was gay and partially believed the partner was responsible for "changing" her; they were eager to believe the prosecutor's lies because it gave them a valid excuse to get rid of her. It helps that she's also upset they allowed their granddaughter, whom she loves like a daughter, to be manipulated into thinking she was sexually abused by the partner.
-   _M\*A\*S\*H_:
    -   As an Establishing Character Moment for Charles.
        
        **Potter:** Up here, it's strictly meatball surgery. Patch them up and get them out.  
        **Charles:** Rather primitive, isn't it?  
        **Potter:** We've got a 98% survival rate, cowboy.  
        **Charles:** Charles. No offense intended, Colonel.  
        **BJ:** Offense _accepted_, Major.  
        **Potter:** Let's not get off on the wrong foot.  
        **Radar:** _\[enters\]_ Doctor Berman is going into heart failure. He can hardly breathe.

-   In _Mindhunter_, when Holden berates Bill for putting in a lackluster work performance, Bill finally tells him the _real_ reason he's been so preoccupied lately: that his son, Brian, was involved in the gruesome murder of another child.

-   In the _Riverdale_ episode "Anatomy of a Murder", Jughead attempts to apologize to Cheryl after his father is arrested for the murder of her brother (wrongfully, as it later turns out). She responds by slapping and hitting him until the other characters pull her off. (Though she herself later apologizes to Jughead for this, which he seems to accept).
-   _Seinfeld_:
    -   In the episode, "The Betrayal", when Jerry continuously apologizes to George for ruining his chances with a girl he had just met, George responds by saying "Stick your sorries in a sack, Mister".
    -   In "The Parking Space", Kramer feels slighted that George and Elaine went to a flea market and didn't invite him. They apologize to him for the unintended offense, but he rejects it, saying it wasn't good enough.
-   In the series finale of _The Shield,_ this is Ronnie's response to Vic when Dutch informs him of the charges being laid against him ("the last three years," a reference to the Strike Team's many dirty deeds). And he is _not_ the least bit subdued about it.
-   In _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, Odo tries making a verbal apology to Kira after he breaks with the Female Changeling, under whose influence he abandoned their resistance, leading to Rom's arrest, impending execution, and looming disaster for the Alpha Quadrant. Not surprisingly, she tells him that is "way, _way_ past sorry." (He does earn her forgiveness for helping them fight off the Dominion and a long conversation some episodes later.)
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   This happens quite a lot for some reason, particularly to Castiel, who spends half his time doing catastrophically awful things (e.g. his Season 6 arc sees him swallowing all the souls in purgatory, becoming drunk on power, declaring himself God, and committing genocide), and the other half desperately trying to atone for said awful things. Needless to say, he can't always fix things by just saying sorry, and although the Winchesters always forgive him eventually he still gets a fair amount of apologies thrown back in his face. For instance in this scene from the Season 8 finale:
        
        **Castiel:** Dean... I'm sorry.  
        **Dean:** For what?  
        **Castiel:** For everything.  
        **Dean:** Everything? Like uh... like ignoring us?  
        **Castiel:** Yes.  
        **Dean:** Like bolting off with the Angel Tablet and then losing it? Because you didn't trust me. You didn't trust _me_.  
        **Castiel:** Yes.  
        **Dean:** Nah, that's not gonna cut it. Not this time. So you can take your little apology and cram it up your ass.
        
    -   This happens to Sam various times when he tries to make amends for starting the apocalypse, and other people (understandably) aren't particularly forgiving. It also finally happens to Dean in Season 9 when he apologizes for letting a friend die, only to be reprimanded by the aforementioned friend (in ghost form) for being self-pitying and selfish, and is told that he's going to have to actually _do_ something to make it right, instead of just sitting around crying about it.
    -   Also occurs between Bobby and Rufus. Due to a mistake Bobby made when they were on a hunt in Omaha, Rufus broke up their partnership and the two had a strained relationship for years. When Bobby finally tries to apologize for what happened, Rufus turned him down instantly, despite the fact that they've been rekindling their friendship.
-   _Young Sheldon_: In "A Romantic Getaway and a Germanic Meat-Based Diet", when Sheldon apologizes to Missy for ratting her out, she opens the door, tells Sheldon "I hate you!" and closes it in his face.

    Music 

-   "Return to Sender" by Elvis Presley is about him writing an apology letter that his girlfriend keeps sending back unopened.
    
    I gave a letter to the postman  
    He put it in his sack  
    Bright early next morning  
    He brought my letter back  
    She wrote upon it  
    Return to sender, address unknown  
    No such number, no such zone  
    We had a quarrel, a lover's spat  
    I write "I'm sorry", but my letter keeps coming back
    
-   JoJo: "Too Little Too Late" is another song based on this trope because her likely narcissistic ex is now hoovering her as she is healing. "It's just too little too late, a little too wrong, and I can't wait. . ."
-   Despite her memories with him, Katy Perry burns up an (admittedly half-hearted) apology letter from her former boyfriend for something he did with another woman at the beginning of her _Part of Me_ video.
-   Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam's "All Cried Out".
    
    **Both:** Don't you know the hurt will cause an inferno?  
    Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame?  
    You were the one who left me neglected.  
    **Male:** I'm so sorry.  
    **Female:** Apology not accepted, led me to the broken heart you collected.
    
-   As quoted above, OneRepublic's song "Apologize" is based _entirely_ on this trope.

    Myths & Religion 

-   _The Bible_: God is generally presented as _extremely_ patient and forgiving, but there _is_ a point where even He will draw the line:
    -   Samuel rebukes King Saul for disobeying God's commands in destroying every single Amalekite (he only spared the king and their sheep and cattle). Saul sincerely repents, but Samuel tells him that God won't accept it and He has rejected him as king of Israel. (Depending on the interpreter, the reason for the lack of forgiveness varies.)
    -   Judaism includes a set of rules about the correct way to apologize. Included in those rules is that if you have wronged someone, then you have to apologize to them. You have to try sincerely to apologize up to three times; if they reject all three, you have fulfilled your obligation to your fellow man. Then you have the right to beg final forgiveness from God on Yom Kippur, the annual day of atonement.
    -   The Bible also repeatedly warns that one day, there will be a final judgment, and by then, it'll be too late to repent.
    -   According to almost every form of Christianity and Islam, there is no ministry in hell. It's too late to repent your sins and accept the love of Jesus or God into your heart once you're dead.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   In the _WWE_, John Laurinaitis demanded an apology from the The Big Show for making fun of his voice, even going as far as forcing him to kneel down and beg for his job. As The Big Show tearfully apologizes, Laurinaitis smugly rejects the apology and fires him anyways.
-   In 1998, to help build heat for Vince McMahon's then still-relatively-new persona as "evil boss" Mr. McMahon, gives Mick Foley a severe dressing down the day after Foley (wrestling as Dude Love) failed to defeat his nemesis "Stone Cold" Steve Austin at a pay-per-view event. Near the end of the scathing promo, Foley offers a tearful "I'm sorry," but McMahon angrily rejects it, berates him some more and then tells him his services "are no longer required."
    -   Vince McMahon has been on the receiving end of this as well. He once was held at gunpoint in the ring by an angry "Stone Cold" Steve Austin ... only for Austin to reveal he had a "Bang!" Flag Gun that revealed a white "Austin 3:16" flag (the infamous promo where McMahon pissed his pants in the ring), before dropping him with a Stone Cold Stunner. Several years later, Trish Stratus and others set McMahon up to have his philandering ways exposed (literally) to his wife, Linda; Vince tried to backpedal and apologize, but Linda demanded a divorce.
-   Bobby Heenan has had many of his apologies flatly if not angrily rejected by others, knowing he was trying to weasel his way out of the responsibility of a major attack or a miscarriage of justice.
    -   With Gorilla Monsoon, a classic example came on the January 23, 1989 episode of _Prime Time Wrestling_, a week after Heenan initiated a sneak attack of the Red Rooster by the Brooklyn Brawler, and when Monsoon got pulled into the middle of the fracas got knocked out. On the January 16 issue, Heenan smugly "apologized," but a week later when he tried to say he was sorry and that he never meant for Monsoon to be hurt, Monsoon scoffed at him and warned him that the USA Network and the WWF had put him on a short leash. A later example came with the September 11, 1989 edition, when Heenan pleaded for forgiveness, this time after he helped initiate a verbal and near-physical confrontation between his protege Rick Rude and Arch-Enemy Roddy Piper.
    -   Multiple times, when former proteges of his were making face turns, Heenan would berate them and slap them in the face, before the guy he tried to attack stalked him, prompting Heenan to do an Oh, Crap! and try to back off, only to get a massive beating (sometimes with Heenan trying to beg for mercy. At least one time, during his AWA days, it (kayfabe) ended with a beating so severe he wound up with a severe concussion and his being placed in a body cast.

    Theatre 

-   In _Lizzie_, the title character does a variant of this. In her first solo song, "This is Not Love", she comments that her sexually abusive father sometimes apologizes for his actions, but always ends up repeating them later. Lizzie understandably rejects these apologies, as well as his claims of loving her, albeit not to his face.

    Video Games 

-   _Absinthia_: Although Freya apologizes for working with Lilith and promises to help defeat her for real, Sera and most of the people of Katti Town understandably refuse to forgive her. They allow her to use the town's shops until Lilith is defeated, but only because they know that they need her for this task.
-   Near the end of _Assassin's Creed_, Altair apologizes to Malik for his arrogance at the beginning of the game, which got Malik's arm cut off and his brother killed. Malik rejects the apology, but not out of spite or anger. He explains that he believes Altair is no longer the same man he was before, so the "new" Altair owes him no apology in a rare, positive example.
-   In the _BioShock Infinite_ DLC game _Burial At Sea: Part 1_, an alternate version of Booker DeWitt, who turns out to be an alternate version of Zachary Comstock who ends up killing Anna as he struggles to take her from her actual father, another Booker DeWitt, tells Elizabeth that he is sorry for what happened. Elizabeth tells him that he's not sorry, but he soon will be... just before he is impaled to death by a Big Daddy.
-   _Blaz Blue Chrono Phantasma_: Ragna tries to apologize to Rachel for their earlier encounter, but Rachel doesn't accept it, saying that it's "hard to be angry at a worm". He then resorts to begging and kneeling, but that only makes Rachel pretend he's not even speaking to her.
-   In _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_, this happens with Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu, whose actions caused the second murder. Hiyoko Saionji refuses to forgive Fuyuhiko, partly because she's a jerkass and partly because the victim was her best friend, Mahiru Koizumi. Hiyoko refuses to forgive Fuyuhiko even after he goes into a Pose of Supplication, but is horrified when he attempts Seppuku. Sometime later, she becomes a little more tolerant of him, but then she's murdered a few days after that.
-   In _Devil May Cry_, Trish is working for Mundus, so when she reveals it to Dante and started attacking him with Nightmare, it failed. She doesn't fight back after this and tried to apologize, only for a furious Dante to point his gun at her and give her a pained "The Reason You Suck" Speech before leaving her behind, much to her sadness.
    
    **Dante**: Don't come any closer, you devil! You may look like my mother, but you're nowhere close to her. You have no soul. You have the face, but you'll never have her fire!
    
-   In _God of War Ragnarök_, following Brok's death, Sindri blames Atreus for it, since he sought out Tyr's help, only for Tyr to turn out to be Odin in disguise, who killed Brok after Brok saw through his disguise.

-   _Heavy Rain_ would have this if Ethan chooses to reject Madison for not telling him that she's a journalist all along.
    
    **Ethan**: You lied to me. I trusted you and you used me. Now I'll never be able to trust you again.
    
-   _Persona_
    -   In _Persona 2: Innocent Sin_, when Lisa and Eikichi remember what they had done to their friend Maya (they had trapped her in a burning shrine many years ago, nearly killing her), they attempt to apologize to her. Maya roughly dismisses them, saying that "I'm sorry" is nothing more than a "convenient phrase" used to transfer guilt onto others, then outright attacks them. Subverted when "Maya" turns out to be Maya's Shadow self. The real Maya helps defeat the Shadow and fully forgives Lisa and Eikichi.
        
        **Shadow Maya:** A thing can be unforgivable, but oh, if they apologize... I say there’s no reason to accept that suffering.
        
    -   The protagonists in _Persona 5_ can inflict a form of Heel–Face Brainwashing on people, convincing them to repent and confess to their crimes. Unfortunately for the major targets, they have all passed the Moral Event Horizon, and are doomed to suffer from this. One exception, though, is Hanae Oda, mother of Shinya Oda, the Tower Confidant- after her heart is stolen, causing her to regret being a jerkass who uses intimidation and bad behavior to get her way while advising her son to do the same, Shinya notes that he's gradually reconciling with her.
-   _Saints Row 2_: At Aisha's funeral, Johnny lays a No-Holds-Barred Beatdown onto Shogo Akuji, the reason the funeral is even happening in the first place. When they try to apologize, Gat _punches them through a tombstone_. Nothing says "Apology **not** accepted" like a concussion. And then being buried alive. Then again, the responsible party only apologized when things started going south for them, since they only came to the funeral to trash it and kill everyone there.
-   _The Sims 2_ has a bug that goes like this: Sim A wrongs Sim B in some fashion, causing them to become enemies; Sim A attempts to apologize; Sim B _appears_ to accept the apology, but then attacks Sim A.
-   In _Tomodachi Life_, when a Mii apologizes to a Mii that they had a fight with, there is a chance this will happen. When it does, the apologizing Mii falls into Sadness state, preventing them from doing anything or having their Happiness level increase. If the two Miis were best friends, sweethearts, or married, that's gone. Though with luck, the apology-rejecting Mii may come around and ask to be friends again.
    
    **Apologizing Mii:** Life is so unexpectedly tough right now. We didn't patch things up. AT ALL.
    
-   Towards the end of a pacifist run in _Undertale_, Asgore apologizes to Toriel for causing the whole mess that kickstarted the plot and wants to make amends for what he had done.

-   In _The Walking Dead: Season Two_, Clementine can choose to forgive or chastise Nick for mistaking her for a walker.

    Web Comics 

-   _Dracula: Ruler of the Night_: Minerva Westenra does this to the hunters, specifically Van Helsing when Helsing apologizes for her being turned into a vampire and offers her "peace" (i.e staking). She shoots back that not only did he fail to protect Lucy from Dracula, but likewise kept what was _really_ going on from her when she was under the impression Lucy's sickness was something standard. Minerva only found out otherwise _after_ she was kidnapped by Dracula's brides, met Dracula himself, was bitten by her now vampirized daughter, and became Dracula's most recent bride, and _willingly_ joins Dracula's fight against the hunters stating that while Dracula may be a bloodsucking monster, at least he's honest in his intentions.
    
    **Minerva**: You assume that this is the corruption speaking for me. I assure it is not, doctor. However good your intention was, the fact that you failed to follow through after not even giving me the courtesy of the true dilemma stings more than becoming one of these creatures. Even if he is a monster, Lord Dracul is at least true to his words. So keep your so-called "peace" _(Eyes glow as she levitates)_ but for my daughter, I will obey his wishes...and you all must die.
    
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Melissa attempted to apologize to Justin for outing him multiple times.

-   In _Schlock Mercenary_, Kevyn rather rudely insults Elf's intelligence on the basis that she dropped out of high school (even though he dropped out himself because he found it boring). After she demonstrates that she's smarter than Kevyn gave her credit for and he realizes that he owes her an apology, Kevyn goes with reverend Theo for advice. He tells Kevyn in no uncertain terms that Elf will probably reject the apology (though she accepts it once Kevyn apologizes sincerely).
    
    **Kevyn:** Reverend, what's the best way to apologize to someone?  
    **Reverend Theo:** Look them in the eye and tell them that you're sorry. The exact wording will vary depending upon how you've wronged them, and whether they already know they've been wronged by you.  
    **Kevyn:** I need to apologize to Elf for making her feel stupid.  
    **Reverend Theo:** Shout the apology at a dead run, and retreat under covering fire provided by troops loyal only to you.  
    **Kevyn:** "Exact wording will vary." Got it.

At the end of the episode, Herb makes it clear that he will never forgive BoJack, not so much for getting him fired, (Herb managed to do all right afterwards) but because BoJack was never there when Herb needed him most. As a result, Herb refuses to give BoJack the satisfaction of burying the hatchet before he dies.
    
    **BoJack:** Hey, I wanted to talk to you about... you know. I feel bad about what happened.  
    **Herb:** So, you're apologizing.  
    **BoJack:** Yes. I'm sorry.  
    **Herb:** _(completely calm)_ Okay. I don't forgive you.  
    **BoJack:** _(clearly surprised)_ Herb, I said I'm sorry.  
    **Herb:** _(as calmly as before)_ Yeah. And I do not forgive you.  
    **BoJack:** Uhhh, not sure you get what's happening here? This could be the last time that—  
    **Herb:** _(getting angry)_ _No._ I'm not gonna give you closure. You don't _get_ that. You have to live with the _shitty_ thing you did for the _rest_ of your life. You have to know that it's _never_, ever going to be okay!  
    **BoJack:** I really think that we'd both feel better if we...  
    **Herb:** I'm _dying!_ I'm not gonna feel better! And I'm not gonna be your prop so _you_ can feel better.  
    **BoJack:** You have to believe me, I did everything I could!  
    **Herb:** Yeah? Then why didn't you call me? _Huh?_ Twenty years, you didn't call me.  
    **BoJack:** Look, I-I-I wanted to, but I didn't think—  
    **Herb:** You know what it was like for me? I had nobody, everybody left. I knew all those showbiz phonies would turn on me, sure, but _you_?  
    **BoJack:** It's not my fault you got fired!  
    **Herb:** _I don't care about the job!_ I did _fine_, I had a good life, but what I needed then was... a friend. And you abandoned me. And I will _never_ forgive you for that. Now get the _fuck_ out of my house!

-   A most vicious Lost in Translation example appeared in an episode of _Ed, Edd n Eddy_. Eddy inadvertently disgraces Rolf by throwing one of his cucumber balls at a fence. When Double D forces Eddy to give Rolf a potted plant as a sign of being sorry, it turns out to be an even greater insult in Rolf's country and Rolf challenges Eddy to a duel. In the end, Eddy finally says sorry, but since he didn't have the traditional "Cupcakes of Sorriness" (which had been earlier suggested as something to give to Rolf as an apology), Rolf still gave him a Curb Stomp No-Holds-Barred Beatdown. At which point everything is cheerfully forgiven and Rolf invites the Eds to partake in the celebratory Eels of Forgiveness. Which involves pouring live eels down their pants. A beaten-down Eddy decides to just go with it this time.

During the public spectacle, Iggy overhears that Stinky and Sid were responsible for his secret getting out and, realizing he's punishing an innocent Arnold, tries to stop the event but is too late to save Arnold from humiliation.

As Bart grovels for forgiveness, everyone — even Uncle Sam who accuses Bart of causing America to lose its way — continues to chant "It's all your fault!". Thinking that's what will happen, Bart doesn't go in and tries to sneak into his room... only to end up on the roof after over-climbing.
