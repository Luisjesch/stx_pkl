People aren't perfect. It's an understandable fact. When a character recognizes this, they might try to improve or eliminate a stock vice (alcohol, masturbation, swearing, eating sweets), which in any other episode would be portrayed as completely normal. But for this episode, the problem must be _completely_ eradicated. Beyond clean living, this is a sterilization of a minor imperfection.

Of course, Cold Turkeys Are Everywhere, Status Quo Is God, and perfect characters aren't relatable for the audience. So, one end of episode Snap Back later, they're back at square one. And the simple problem is never exaggerated this much again.

This is common in episodes revolving around New Year's Resolutions, dieting, abstinence, re-finding religion, etc. Expect a family character to force others to participate alongside them.

Compare Compressed Vice, where a new fault is expanded and eliminated. Consider also "Flowers for Algernon" Syndrome and Mr. Vice Guy.
