_"Pokémon only do bad things because master bad."_

Monsters are born of human fears. Ghoulies, ghosties, long-leggety beasties, and Things That Go "Bump" in the Night, and they all share a common factor — they _threaten_. Their claws are sharper, their muscles are stronger, their fangs tear faster... you can generally count on monsters to be capable of hurting things, usually _you_.

And then there are these guys. These monsters aren't after you. They don't want to hurt you. Mostly, they want nothing to do with you in the first place. They might even be kind to you if you encounter them.

Benevolent Monsters are fantastic creatures that are usually no more dangerous than Real Life flora and fauna. Many times, they will even be _safer_, despite any indication of powers or prowess to the contrary. Any threat they pose to the good guys is often due to Poor Communication Kills (it could be that the Monster Is a Mommy) and may even be a case of Let's You and Him Fight, with the monsters joining forces with the heroes to take on the villains. Settings with Benevolent Monsters are usually the best residence for the Zombie Advocate, though be on the watch for Van Helsing Hate Crimes.

Note that for Benevolent Monsters to be in effect, non-maliciousness must be the default state of all or most of the monsters, so that malice or villainy becomes the rare exception to the rule. This can also apply to certain species of monster within a work, rather than all the varied types (_i.e._ the vampires in Setting X are all evil, but the werewolves are all Benevolent Monsters).

All of the above types of monsters are usually depicted as being evil and scary. Also closely related to the Reluctant Monster, which is a monster that may look frightening, but has no actual desire to harm people. Also see Dark Is Not Evil, where characters themed around dark or terrifying things are actually benevolent or at least not malicious, and Face of a Thug, which has the same general "looks scary but is actually nice" dynamic as this trope without necessarily being about monsters specifically. See also Domesticated Dinosaurs, where this trope applies to prehistoric animals.

Compare this trope with Humans Are the Real Monsters, which is this trope's blood brother; after all, if the monsters aren't evil, then _somebody_ else probably is. Compare and contrast with the Non-Malicious Monster, which is a monster that really _is_ very dangerous, but is _not_ consciously evil or malevolent; it is simply acting out of animalistic instinct (i.e. killing and eating people just to survive). Lastly, there's Not Always Evil, which would be when the monsters in question have other interests besides being villains all the time.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _The Demon Prince of Momochi House_: Main love interest Aoi Nanamori is a human\-turned-Nue.
-   The Demons of Galuna Island in _Fairy Tail._ They look quite freaky, but don't have an evil bone in their bodies. They even started a rumor that Galuna was cursed so people wouldn't come to their Hidden Elf Village and be horrified by their appearance.
-   _Heterogenia Linguistico_: The werewolves, Lizard Folk, minotaurs, and so on are just as sapient as humans, they just communicate in different ways. And far from being "monsters", they all have their own complex cultures and customs, which Hakaba has to learn to navigate. No one has been actively malicious to him, though some behaviors can seem rude or hostile to those unfamiliar with the culture.
-   _Pokémon_. In the anime, this comes up a _lot_. Check the quote from Team Rocket's Ekans from the anime's first season up top.

    Comic Books 

-   _Princeless_: The dragons breathe fire and eat knights because it is the cultural expectation of the humans that they will protect the princess until a worthy suitor comes to slay it and rescue the princess. The dragons are intelligent and generally don't realize that they're supposed to just die for the sake of the hero. Adrienne actually befriends her dragon and informs her of this. Sparky is resultingly horrified and happy to change the status quo.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Madam & Eve_: In one set of strips, a family of Tokoloshes move in next door to the Andersons.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: In this _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_ fanfiction, Monster X is essentially this to the human race. Monster X is a gigantic Kaiju and rather terrifying-looking, but it's overall highly benign and even benevolent to humans who haven't crossed it, and it goes more out of their way than even heroic Titans like Godzilla and Mothra do to avoid human casualties when it can. This trope is particularly prominent when Monster X tries asking terrified civilians for directions at one point.
-   _Godzilla: New Era_: The third Godzilla, later revealed to be the fully grown Junior from _Godzilla vs. Destoroyah_, is revealed to be this. Whereas his predecessors were fully destructive, he goes out of his way to protect humanity due to remembering being raised by a kindly biologist and being treated well by humans as an infant. This isn't immediately obvious however and required the G.P.N. to figure it out. His seeming incursions into civilization and hostile actions were revealed to be because he was aware of and chasing the Millennian the humans were ignorant of.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Beauty and the Beast_: The Beast starts out more or less as a monster in every measure, but under Belle's influence, he begins to show such qualities as kindness, thoughtfulness, selflessness and table manners.
-   The title characters in _The Boxtrolls_ are kind-hearted creatures that do little more than take trash to their underground lairs to make contraptions. The people above ground, however, fear them because they don't know what they really are, and are goaded along by the film's real Big Bad, who plots to use them to advance his social status.
-   In _Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2_, Chester V draws Flint and crew to the island by warning him of the human-eating Cheespider, with its taste for Live Corp. employees and its plans for global domination, but as the heroes explore the island, it seems that almost no other species on the island poses them any threat. Indeed, Flint's dad's biggest problem is the mischief from the pickle people. It turns out that, in stark contrast to the first film, even the Cheespider is benevolent; the animals all hate Live Corp, which has evil designs for the FLDSMDFR and the unnatural wildlife.
-   _How to Train Your Dragon_:
    -   _How to Train Your Dragon (2010)_: Despite the dragons menacing Berk, stealing their sheep and burning down their homes, it turns out that they do this at the behest of a colossal dragon queen. On their own, they integrate with such ease into Viking life that it boggles the mind. Indeed, as far as the movie is concerned, the Dragon Manual listing the threat of some dragons is a string of Informed Attributes.
    -   _How to Train Your Dragon 2_: The entire weight of dragon villainy rests on the shoulders of one man, Big Bad Drago. In _this_ movie, dragons only do bad things when made to do so by a bad man.
-   Pixar's _Monsters, Inc._ features this as the foundational Worldbuilding point — monsters scaring children at night is just business. Indeed, monsters would be perfectly content to leave humans alone if they weren't dependent on human children for energy. The same goes for _Monsters University_, the prequel. Besides the heroes, many of their co-workers and classmates are exceedingly unscary.
-   In _A Monster in Paris_, when Lucille faints after seeing Francœur's face, he automatically reaches out to catch her. The majority of the movie is Lucille passing off Francœur as a masked musician to allow him to perform in public. The true monster in the movie is the glory obsessed police commissioner looking to kill Francœur to save his reputation.
-   The monsters in _Monsters vs. Aliens_ have no malicious intent whatsoever, and are merely imprisoned to keep from scaring people with their presence. At least one, the Missing Link, likes to scare people for laughs, but otherwise, they're pretty decent.
-   The title character in _Shrek_ is an ogre who, while anti-social, isn't malicious in any way. He mostly plays the part to scare people away so he can live in peace. Once he's friends with you, he's loyal and true, if a bit cranky.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Godzilla's various incarnations have fallen under this as have other monsters in the Toho universe. After his Heel–Face Turn, the Showa (1955-1975) incarnation of Godzilla is a more heroic character that protects earth from various evil forces.
    -   Both Minilla and Junior are Gentle Giant versions of the Godzilla species who live peacefully alongside humanity. Like the Showa Godzilla, they are protectors of the earth.
    -   Mothra is by far the most benevolent of the Toho monsters. She's often portrayed as a guardian deity of the fictional Infant Island and will only attack to defend her Shobijin companions from being captured or to save her larvae from being eaten by predators.
    -   Biollante, thanks to the human DNA and spirit as part of her genetic makeup, is also a peaceful creature, except where Godzilla or threatening her father is concerned. She kills and drives off three intruders seeking the Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria in self- and home-defense, and in their first encounter, she seeks to neutralize Godzilla as well as join them together, since they have the same DNA. In their second battle, after she has evolved into her titanic crocodile-plant form, she ruthlessly tries to kill Godzilla, but again in order to stop his rampages.
    -   The film _War of the Gargantuas_ features the two titular monsters. One of them, Gaira, is a horrific green giant who feeds on human flesh. The other, Sanda, is also a giant, but he's far more peaceful due to being raised by humans rather than eating them. Sanda even performs a Heroic Sacrifice to save mankind from his brother's voracious appetite by fighting him to the death.
    -   The 2014 US version of Godzilla is capable of causing tsunamis just by walking out of the water. He doesn't mean to, of course. It's just that he's so huge he ends up causing destruction by _accident_. For the most part, he prefers to spend his time swimming peacefully in the oceans and feeding on Earth's natural radiation sources. The only reason he even showed up in civilization in the first place was to fight the comparatively more vicious MUTO.
    -   Although it would be a stretch to apply this to previous incarnations of the character that is normally a classic Non-Malicious Monster, _Kong: Skull Island_ treats Kong himself this way via Adaptational Heroism. Excluding accidents due to his sheer size, he's virtually harmless to humans who don't antagonize him first, and will even go out of his way to protect them.
        
        Kong's a pretty good king. Keeps to himself mostly.
        
-   Harry in _Harry and the Hendersons_. A Sasquatch that Mr. Henderson hit with his car and eventually befriends the family.
-   The title character in _A Monster Calls_ is a gigantic tree-man who seems to want nothing more than to help a boy come to terms with the possibility of his mother's death and his strained relationship with his grandmother. It's open to interpretation whether he is simply an Imaginary Friend, or — as a Freeze-Frame Bonus suggests — possibly the ghost of the boy's grandfather. There's also a scene where the kid and his mom watch the original _King Kong (1933)_, and are clearly sympathetic to Kong himself, mostly because — like the mother — his death seems inevitable.
-   _The Shape of Water_ takes this trope even further, with the heroine falling in love with the Amphibian Man she is trying to save from dissection. And yes, they do have sex.
-   The Troglodyte, a sort of giant Frazetta Man, in _Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger_ . When he first appears, the heroes are scared of him and prepare for a fight, but they quickly realize he's more scared of them than they are of him. Once they're able to communicate with him, he tags along for the rest of the adventure, even fighting alongside Sinbad at the climax and dying bravely.

    Literature 

-   _Animorphs_: The Hork-Bajir are fearsome looking creatures with blades sticking out in almost every direction, but when they are introduced, Elfangor stresses that they are good people when they don't have a Yeerk in their brain. The blades are actually for slicing apart the plants they eat on their homeworld. The Animorphs actually manage to free a few and find out it's true, they're some of the most chilled out characters in the series, if a bit dim.
-   Bogeymen in _Discworld_ have the time-honoured role of scaring kids, but there's no record of them actually _harming_ anyone, and the first ever bogeyman started to see itself as a protector, becoming the first tooth fairy.
    -   In fact, "monsters" in Discworld mostly have the same moral spectrum as humans so several of them are this. Angua is a vegetarian werewolf and Lawful Good watch member, and it's implied that the werewolf community, in Ankh-Morpork at least, largely police themselves and avoid hurting humans. Margolotta, Otto von Chriek and _many_ others are Friendly Neighborhood Vampires. The first _orc_ to show up in Discworld is a Badass Bookworm who tries to achieve worth by doing good work. The monstrous monsters like Wolfgang (a werewolf), Dragon King of Arms (a vampire) and Mr. Gryle (a banshee) are actually the minority of villains; most books' antagonists are humans.
-   In _InCryptid_, most sapient cryptids (the more fearsome-looking include dragons, chupacabra, and gorgons) are no more good or evil than any given human, and the non-sapient ones are as incapable of being evil as any mundane animal. The real villains are the Covenant of St. George, who want to exterminate all non-human sapients and many of the non-sapients. The major exception is the Johrlac species, of which almost all known members are, if not Always Chaotic Evil, operating on such Blue-and-Orange Morality that it makes no difference. The few non-sociopathic Johrlac are definitely Benevolent Monsters, though they look physically indistinguishable from humans.
-   As part of the double-twist ending of _I Sit Behind The Eyes_, the titular Entity is revealed to be this. After the first twist of the Narrator being a Tomato in the Mirror, who has been doing a Body Surf throughout the entirety of human history, it turns out that it only ever possesses Psychopaths and ruthless tyrants. The little girl it is currently possessing is actually an Enfant Terrible who had attempted to murder a local bully.
-   In the John Carter of Mars series, most of Mars' intelligent races are essentially Human Aliens, with the sole exception of the towering Green Martians, who have four arms, tusks, antennae, and are up to sixteen feet tall. Over the first book, Carter befriends a Green warrior named Tars Tarkas, who — by the end of the book - has became jeddak ("king", roughly) of the Thark tribe, and is a recurring supporting hero for the next few books.
-   E.E. "Doc" Smith's _Lensman_ series has the Velantians, Rigellians and Palaininans to name a few; monstrous sentient creatures which not only don't resemble humans (i.e. they are not even bipedal) but often have completely different sets of values - and who are wholly on the side of the good guys.
-   _Where the Wild Things Are_ by Maurice Sendak features Max, a troublesome child, who is sent by his parents to his room. After a series of escapades, he meets the titular Wild Things. While they frolic quite fiercely, they're not in other ways malicious.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_: In "Demons of the Punjab", the Thijarians used to be the universe's foremost assassins, but after the destruction of their homeworld, the survivors took on a mission of witnessing the deaths of people who died alone and unmourned. When they turn up on Earth to remember the unmourned of the violence triggered by the Partition of India, the Doctor, only knowing them by their outdated reputation, initially assumes they're on Earth for malevolent reasons.
-   In _Grimm_, most Wesen are harmless law abiding citizens. In fact, some are ridiculously harmless, like Eisbibers and Mauzhertz who tend to be quite docile and quiet. Although, there are some species that lean toward being Always Chaotic Evil.
-   _The Muppets_: Similar to Sesame Street below, the Muppets have a wide range of monsters, some of which are likely to eat you, but also a lot who are generally friendly, particularly Sweetums, a 7 or 8 foot tall ogre who's usually quite agreeable and helpful. There’s also Thog, a huge blue creature who is very gentle and kind.
-   _Sesame Street_ has long made a point of featuring the cuddliest of monsters, from Elmo to the easily-amused Count, to the ever-hungry Cookie Monster. The worst of the lot is usually Oscar, who's just the Grouch. Indeed, some of the nicest monsters are the toughest, scariest-looking, like Herry and Frazzle. In many of Herry's early appearances, he appears to be mean or frightening, but ends up showing his friendly side (often after he unintentionally scared others off).
-   Although most monsters on _Supernatural_ tend toward Always Chaotic Evil with a few exceptions thrown in, Season 11 introduces the zanna, a benevolent race of fae-type creatures who act as children's imaginary friends, guiding and helping them to grow up and moving on to a new child when the previous one no longer needs them.
-   A number of _Ultra Series_ feature Gentle Giant Kaiju, either as allies or as Monsters of the Week who are protected, assisted, and/or spared. Some notable examples are:
    -   Pygmon/Pigmon from the original _Ultraman_ is actually human-sized, but is a noteworthy mention here because it is friendly with humans and often helps the defense teams against the giant and less friendly monsters.
    -   _Ultraseven_'s Capsule Kaiju are a trio of monsters that Seven would call up whenever he needed a helping hand against the Monster of the Week.
    -   _Ultraman Cosmos_ featured these by the dozen, alongside many Non Malicious Monsters. Cosmos's duty was not to battle them for humanity like a typical Ultra might, but instead he often had to save them from the corrupting powers of Chaos Header and help them coexist with humans.
    -   _Ultraman X_ featured a Gomora Spark Doll who belonged to Daichi as a Tragic Keepsake from his parents disappearing during the Ultra Flare that set the series off. When the crew of XIO did an experiment to temporarily restore it to its normal form, it quickly became evident that it was extremely gentle, and was later visibly horrified seeing what happened when Dark Thunder Energy caused it to go on a rampage as EX Gomora.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Candyland_ has Gloppy, the friendly Molasses Monster of Molasses Swamp.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ and _Pathfinder_ are both full of monster types that tend towards good, and even the ones that are usually evil might have good individual members.

    Video Games 

-   A few of the Youkai in _Ayakashi: Romance Reborn_ could certainly qualify, considering they're much nicer than their classical depictions. It's most pronounced with Kuro, who is The Cutie and a Keet... and a Nue, which has a reputation for being a bringer of misfortune (which isn't true at all in the game).
-   _Bloodborne_: Your job is to hunt monsters who've been terrorizing a remote city, and most of what you find (including the humans) will attack on sight, but there are a few creatures who are quite friendly.
    -   The Messengers of the Hunter's Dream look like freaky little emaciated people, but they have a childlike innocence and adore hunters. They help you out through the game (they give you weapons, act as shopkeepers, deliver notes from other players, and so on), and you can even find small items that serve no purpose other than letting the Messengers play dress-up. It's surprisingly adorable.
    -   The Plain Doll's background info emphasizes her Uncanny Valley nature (the description of the Tear Stone calls it "naive" to think that a doll crying Tears of Joy is cute), but players are more likely to disregard this and focus on how she's one of the few characters in the game that are unfailingly nice to the player character (she won't even care if you kill her), she provides invaluable help by leveling you up, and will perform cute responses to gestures. She'll also become your caretaker if you get the _Childhood's Beginning_ ending and become an infant Great One.
    -   The Great Ones could be considered this trope at best and non-malicious at worst; they are described as "sympathetic in spirit" and seem to largely be trying to help out, with problems arising from humans being as alien to them as they are to us, and humans either biting off more than they could chew, very deliberately misusing the knowledge, or going to immoral lengths in an attempt to learn more.
-   In _Dragon Quest Builders 2_, not all monster tribes are affiliated with the destruction-worshiping Children of Hargon. Some, like the fat rats and bodkins of Furrowfield island, have a history of living in harmony with humans.
-   Umaro the Yeti from _Final Fantasy VI_, who is in fact a party member.
-   Beastmen in _Final Fantasy XIV_ are generally territorial and hostile towards the other races with only a handful being non hostile and willing to work with other people. Every beast tribe also has summoned a primal at least once, which causes damage to the land andtempering people to become the primal's slaves. The Namazu are only beast tribe that's actually friendly (only a few are hostile) and are willing to make trades with other people. They are also the only beast tribe that has never summoned a primal.
-   _Kingdom Hearts 3D \[Dream Drop Distance\]_ has the benevolent Spirit Dream Eaters who eat bad dreams and ally with you as opposed to the hostile Nightmare Dream Eaters who do the opposite.
    -   And in _Kingdom Hearts III_, Sora becomes a werecat-like monster himself while in Monstropolis, but remains kind-hearted and happy to play with Boo. He also qualifies as this in earlier games as a vampire and merman, two well-known monster types.
    -   Even among The Heartless, at least two examples of this exist, despite the fact that all Heartless are said to be mindless, instinctual beasts by default; The White Mushrooms from _Kingdom Hearts_, which don't attack Sora and only want him to use specific magic spells on them three times, even rewarding him with rare items if he does so, and the Flantastic Seven from _Kingdom Hearts III_, which also don't attack Sora and challenge him to minigames instead, and also reward him with rare ingredients to be used to cook stat-boosting food at the bistro in Twilight Town if he wins.
-   The Nether Update in _Minecraft_ introduces the Strider, the first passive mob exclusive to the Nether. By using its favorite food, warped fungus, and a saddle, the player can ride a Strider to safely traverse the vast lava lakes in the Nether.
-   _Moshi Monsters_: All of the monsters who belong to an established species (Zommers, Katsumas etc) are benevolent as are most of the Cartoon Creature's. The exception is C.L.O.N.C (the Criminal League Of Naughty Critters) which is a group consisting of all the villains.
-   The Walking Bushie in _Mother 3_ is a random encounter who, rather than attack you, will instead cast Lifeup α and Healing α on your whole party systematically until everyone is at full health, make your whole party feel refreshed with some fresh air, and finally greet them politely and leave. The closest it will come to actually "harming" the party is by solidifying one by becoming friendly and affectionate, unless you go well out of your way to bring Kumatora along who can hit them with Brainshock.
-   _Pokémon_ has gone far, _far_ out of its way to establish this (despite the fact that the mascot is a footlong rat that can _shoot lightning from its face_), with the inevitable result of Humans Are the Real Monsters; no matter how rational any given Pokémon is, you can generally expect the moral weight of its actions to be assigned to the trainer.
    -   In _Pokémon Gold and Silver_, Elm's aide waxes depressing about the starter Pokémon stolen by the Jerkass rival, and mentions that Pokémon turn evil when used by evil trainers.
    -   The main conflict in _Pokémon Black and White_ is that people treat Pokémon unfairly by taking them for granted, which would make sense only if the humans assumed they posed no more threat than the average well-kept housepet.
    -   Shadow Pokemon are a Double Subversion. The main premise of the games is that these are special Pokémon who will attack humans on command (as though they normally _wouldn't_), but these Shadow Pokémon are created by subjecting normal ones to what is suggested to be a kind of Mind Rape. They can be healed by good treatment, companionship, and sometimes even a visit from one of the Olympus Mons.
    -   _Pokémon Mystery Dungeon_ has one or two officially evil Pokémon, like the absolute _creep_ of a Gengar from the first installment, but they don't count for much since _all the characters_ are Pokémon. And even Gengar eventually reforms in a bonus quest, which reveals that he was originally a human (specifically, the one who abandoned Gardevoir and started the whole Ninetales legend that he was accusing you of perpetrating).
-   _Undertale_'s entire premise is based on this trope. Although in practice, it plays with it, as most of the "main" monsters the player meets do genuinely intend to hurt the player... they just don't quite realize that hurting actually hurts, or don't feel they have a choice, or it's their job, or it's for a good cause, or... you get the idea. The only actively malicious monster is Flowey, who isn't actually a monster at all, but the Soulless Shell of Asriel Dreemurr.
-   A single one of the Vipers in _Secret of Evermore_ is friendly, or at least neutral, and not only scolds you for striking him but also provides a handy save point in their lair. Dialogue with him implies that his entire Viper species were once little more than mere rivals toward humans who typically only did what they needed to do to survive or benefit their own kind, until _someone_ took command of them and made them be aggressive toward humans.
-   The Merchant in _Resident Evil 4_ is clearly infected by Los Plagas like the other insane villagers, but would much rather sell Leon firearms, _give him a firearm_ if he shoots some medallions for fun, or host a fun shooting gallery minigame for free. True he charges what are apparently exorbitant prices for his services, but since they use the archaic and rather worthless currency of Pesetas, it means he's selling you that rifle for about $80.
-   _World of Warcraft_: It bears repeating that just because the Horde have all the monstrous races - Orcs, Trolls, Tauren, Forsaken Undead, Goblins, Blood Elves, Nightborne and Vulperi - doesn't necessarily mean that they are always the bad guys or in the wrong.

    Visual Novels 

    Web Animation 

-   _Holidaze (2019)_:
    -   While Jangle is out frightening trick-or-treaters, it is implied that he has no real zeal for scaring, quickly losing steam as he does so on his own and takes no joy when his friends frighten off Jingle. It isn't until he meets Jingle does he come out of his shell and start socializing like a normal person.
    -   Jingle is a reindeer-like monster who represents the Spirit of Christmas. Because of this, he has zero desire to scare and all he cares about is spreading joy and cheer.

    Webcomics 

-   The titular _Erma_ is a Half-Human Hybrid Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl modeled after Sadako of _The Ring_, but though she tends to like pretty macabre things she's a sweet and friendly kid and generally uses her extensive powers (levitation, telekinesis, using TV screens as portals, etc.) for nothing more malicious than childish pranks (well, as long as you don't do anything stupid like threatening her friends or babysitter). She takes after her mother Emiko, who is a full yokai with similar powers but is a caring parent and is Happily Married to her human husband Sam.
-   In _Meadowhawk_, the dragons still have all the fangs, claws and spikes from the bad old days, but in modern times they're almost invariably pacifists and usually don't even eat meat.
    
    **Tater:** If history is to be believed, we were once a species of marauding monsters. Bloodthirsty, airborne, fire-spewing terrors. Look at any Dark Ages story, and there we are: "RAAAAWR!" Now we have food shelves, hospitals, we live in houses... most of out kind would be loath to harm even a fly.
    
-   _Muted_: Dendro is an adorable demon that gives hugs and emotional support.
-   In _The Order of the Stick_, Serini Toormuck has assembled a group of unusal non-humanoid monsters that even humans who might consider orcs and goblins to be people would probably see as abominations (in some cases because that's literally their creature type), apparently just by being nice to them. In particular, a beholder who sees her as a parental figure, and who really doesn't want to hurt anyone. This is in keeping with OotS's thesis that the Always Chaotic Evil races are only that way because everyone _expects_ them to be, and won't give them a chance to be anything else. Except vampires. Those guys are very specifically created to be irredemably evil, and also utter jerks about it.
-   _Pebble and Wren_: All the monsters we see are friendly and amicable, and quite a few of them live in harmony with humans.

    Western Animation 

-   _Class of the Titans_ had a few, most notably Cerberus; while he certainly _looked_ terrifying, what with his size, the venomous serpent for a tail, and the three skulls with glowing red eyes for heads, but for the most part he was a Big Friendly Dog, at least when his master Hades was around (which was most of the time).
-   _Fangface_ was a '70s animated show about a werewolf who was a good guy, and helped his human friends catch other monsters.
-   Disney Television's _Gargoyles_ were relocated from Scotland to Manhattan by The Chessmaster David Xanatos to serve as his bodyguards and enforcers. However, once the Gargoyles learned that they were being manipulated by Xanatos, they have a Heel–Face Turn, and instead work to defend the people of New York. Except for Demona, of course, who is a genocidal maniac.
-   _Inhumanoids_: the Inhumanoids themselves are pure evil, but the two factions of Mutore — the Granites and the genuinely terrifying-looking Redwoods — are good guys. There's also the weird magnetic being Magnokor, who is a good guy and has been keeping the Inhumanoids' leader, Metlar, restrained for most of human history.
-   _Kong: The Animated Series_: Kong is this due to Adaptational Heroism.
