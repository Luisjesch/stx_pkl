_"While the wee wife's away, a word on the subject of onanism: in this house, we don't masturbate. It's not a very pleasant thing to do. One hates to imagine young Chloe or Radclyffe scampering down the stairs of a Saturday morning, only to find you, double-bent on the sofa, pumping your fist!"_

A subtrope of Cringe Comedy. A character, thinking they are alone, decides to masturbate only to be interrupted by their partner, parent, sibling, best friend, The Vicar (for maximum laughs) or whatever. Seriously, people: next time just lock the door.

Usually Played for Laughs. Occasionally Played for Drama, except in Christian cinema, where masturbation, porn, and occasionally the internet frequently cause the primary conflict. Sometimes it may overlap with Mistaken for Masturbating. For when it is not a solo situation, see Interrupted Intimacy.

Compare with Parents Walk In at the Worst Time, when someone's parents catches them with another person. Contrast with I'll Be in My Bunk, when a character leaves the room in an awkward and obvious fashion which makes it clear that they are going to go masturbate.

    Advertising 

-   For a long time, Holeproof underwear's slogan was "One day, you're gonna get caught with your pants down".
-   An insurance advertisement had a similar slogan, with a naked man sneaking into their office to get his payout.
-   A 1-888-Smile-Info ad has an Office Lady coming back exhausted from home, stripping herself naked on her way to the bathroom, but before she can reach it, she's caught naked by a surprise party in her living room.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Featured in one of the fake volume previews for _Attack on Titan_, with Jean's mother walking in on him while he's dealing with the curse of puberty.
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_:
    -   Matsuri walks into Reo's room when she's barely-dressed and greatly enjoying running a fan over her bare crotch. Humorously, Matsuri doesn't react to her being scantily-clad (until her breasts pop out of his shirt), and Reo is only embarrassed because he saw her room was such a mess.
    -   When Kanade shows Matsuri a Pensieve Flashback of Suzu's life to explain why she exists as a Split Personality inside Suzu, she unintentionally starts with Suzu's shower the previous day, treating Matsuri to the sight of Suzu masturbating to him. She's not technically "caught", as they weren't actually there.
-   _Bleach_: In the manga, Ichigo returns from Soul Society only to walk in on Kon in his body with his hand down his pants, jerking off to an imagined threesome with Rukia and Orihime. Ichigo is not impressed.
-   _Bokurano_:
    -   In the manga, it's implied that Dung Beetle catches Anko like this at one point. She's none too happy about it. In a subversion, he caught her daydreaming and dancing when she's home alone, not masturbating.
    -   Mako "Nakama" Nakarai invokes the trope before fighting. The Alpha Bitch who bullies Mako is having sex with a guy (presumably her boyfriend) inside a hotel room within the fight area, and she asks Koyemshi to rescue the couple before any of them get a chance to get dressed so they end up naked first in the cockpit, where all the pilot children are. After Mako gives the Alpha Bitch a slap and a What the Hell, Hero?, they're sent inside a van on which the girl's mother is leaving the battle area. Given that the fight had not even started, is pretty much given that Mako did it on purpose, to teach the Alpha Bitch a lesson about caring for other people: it ultimately works, as Mako's arc ends with said Alpha Bitch acting more humbly as she helps clean up the classroom.
-   Happens in _Code Geass_ (the infamous "Table-kun" incident). Fortunately for Nina, Nunally couldn't see what was happening and is too innocent to realize what was going on. Probably. Hopefully.
-   At the end of the _Cube×Cursed×Curious_ OVA, the gang catches Shiraho wiggling on top of Sovereignty's sleeping bag and breathing in her scent. Shiraho doesn't take it well.
-   _Death Note_: Light Yagami uses hidden dirty magazines as an excuse for making sure other people haven't entered his room, knowing that there are cameras and bugs in his room. His father is shocked to see his son read such things, but L even remarks it's perfectly natural for someone his age.
-   _F3: Frantic, Frustrated & Female_: The opening scene has Sayaka return home early and catch her kid sis, Hiroe, trying desperately to get herself off with a vibrating dildo — except _she can't_.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_ is a 22-year-old virgin living on the roof of the middle school where he teaches. He works off the frustrations that come with being a Chivalrous Pervert, so it's no surprise that he's been literally caught with his pants down.
-   In one chapter of the _Gunsmith Cats_ manga, Minnie May is masturbating to a photo of her missing boyfriend Kenny when Becky walks in on her.
-   A double entry from _Haruhi Suzumiya_ when Kyon is closing the pictures of Mikuru's chest with star-shaped mole: He forgot to close the folder which had the name of "Mikuru" written as the folder name. It's busted by Haruhi spotting Mikuru having some "fun" with Kyon — which does not translate so well for the world.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ strongly implies that France was caught by Germany, with his pants down. France had been reflecting on his military history and telling himself how strong he was, getting more agitated, and red and blue-striped in the face all the while. Then Germany bursts in with a gun drawn looks horrified for a second then says, "I hate to disturb you when you're busy, but put your hands in the air".
-   In _I Don’t Like You at All, Big Brother!!_, Shuusuke was completely nonplussed when Iroha told him how much he masturbates (5 times a day!), down to which hand he uses. It turned out she snooped him through a telescope.
-   _The very first scene_ of _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean_ has Jolyne complaining that a prison guard caught her in the act.
-   _My Balls_. Subverted when Elyse puts Kohta under a sort of "hypnosis" so she can take advantage of him without his knowledge. He snaps out of it several times with her in... compromising positions.
-   _My Wife is the Student Council President_: It happens to Ui during episode 2, as she's fantasizing about having her first time with Izumi. She gets so into it that she starts dry-humping her mattress, which is the exact moment he walks in and catches her in the act!
    
    **Ui**: _\[mortified\]_ H-how long were you standing there??
    
    **Izumi:** _\[matter-of-factly\]_ Since right around the time you started to get into it.
    
-   Subverted in _My Dress-Up Darling_ when Wakana's grandfather walks in on him playing an H-Game as reference for the costume he's making. His grandfather writes it off as standard teenage behavior, but is more disturbed by his nonchalant attitude and the fact that he's taking notes.
-   In chapter 337 of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, Eva walks in on Chachamaru winding herself up (technically, powering self up, but it has VERY similar effects to sexual arousal) while calling out Negi's name. Hilarity Ensues since Eva is _very_ amused and pleased.

-   The pivotal moment of episode 1 of _O Maidens in Your Savage Season_ is Kazusa interrupting her childhood friend Izumi in his private moment of watching a porno about a woman getting molested on a public train. This greatly traumatizes Kazusa who had a crippling fear of sex.

-   In Episode 13 of _Osomatsu-san_, Osomatsu walks in on Choromatsu masturbating to a porn mag, earning the latter the Embarrassing Nickname of "Fappymatsu".
-   Played with in _Seitokai Yakuindomo_, naturally: Shino is concerned about her breasts, and then remembers a rumour that they become bigger if you massage them. So she starts to rub her breasts over her shirt when Takatoshi walks in. It's quite awkward, but then Shino tries to save face. How? By declaring that she's 'just sexually frustrated'. Takatoshi mutters that that isn't a very good excuse.
-   Alice learns the hard way in _Serial Experiments Lain_ that internet surveillance is more intensive than she thought... Of course, the fact her best friend is an omnipresent god who can materialise in Alice's room at will doesn't help either.
-   _Shimoneta_: In chapter 10, Ayame enters the girls' locker-room and finds Oboro pinned on the floor, with Taunkichi holding "her" legs open. Made more incriminating since Oboro's skirt was bunched around his waist and his panties were visibly soaked. Ayame takes one look at the scene, assumes she's interrupting, and ducks back outside without saying a word.
-   _To Love Ru Darkness_: Momo gets caught by her twin sister playing with her tail. Luckily for her, Nana is too innocent to realize what Momo was doing.
-   _Virgin Night_: A student gets caught masturbating by his tutor, which kicks off "The First Goodbye".
-   An implied near-miss happens to Maho Nitori in _Wandering Son_. She and her brother Shuuichi sleep in bunk beds and at the end of chapter 39 when Shuuichi is woken up by creaking sounds and looks to see a panicked Maho out of bed asking if he'd heard. As she leaves the room, her pajama bottoms have a dark stain. The situation implies either this trope, an aversion of No Periods, Period, or, what the heck, both. From the looks of it, it was probably a period stain; she also mutters something about whether had mom had "any", implying tampons or pads. Though she did act a bit too suspicious and embarrassed.
-   Happens to Satou when his mother walks in on him in the _Welcome to the NHK_ manga, with the added embarrassment that he's looking at Hentai at the time. And has set up a customized rig for internet porn in his parents' spare bedroom, complete with a leather massage chair. To make matters worse, he proceeds to stumble on the headphones cable, unplugging it and _flooding the room with ultra-loud girly sex moaning_. Satou freaking snaps then and there.
-   _Yuria 100 Shiki_ pretty much runs on this trope. At least, it does with the titular Yuria. The slightly more advanced Juria poses as an inanimate sex toy, so she's more likely to invert the trope, pretending to be "in use" by her owner to get out of situations that would reveal her true nature.

    Fan Works 

-   _Before the Silver Doe_ by Metafrantic takes this to ludicrous levels. First, Hermione walks in on Harry masturbating. Then, Harry walks in on Hermione masturbating. Then Harry masturbates to the thought of Ginny masturbating in the same way that he had caught Hermione masturbating. Then Hermione decides to watch Harry masturbate. And THEN Harry watches Hermione masturbate with the latter's consent and ends up masturbating to Hermione's masturbation. It becomes rather funny after a while.
-   _Code MENT_, naturally, handled the above _Code Geass_ example with the amount of tact and subtlety one would expect from an Abridged Series:
    
    **Nunally:** I think Nina's really sick. I walked in on her in the Student-Faculty Room and she sounded like a dying coyote.
    
-   In _Cyberpunk: Another Daybreak_, David is in the shower when he gets a call about Ark hacking a school bus full of elementary school kids.

-   The _Haruhi Suzumiya_ fic _The Coin:_ Haruhi has just begun to discover her Reality Warper powers; unrelated, she's in the mood for some, ahem, _relief_. Her mind wanders to Kyon while she's doing it, and moments later Kyon gets teleported outside her bedroom door. She gets her pants back on before she lets him in. It says a lot about their lives that neither of them think too hard about exactly how he got teleported.
    
    **Kyon:** _\[peering closely\]_ Are you flushed, Haruhi?  
    **Haruhi:** You're imagining things.
    
-   An _ER_ fanfic had Doug walking in on Carol as she was doing this. She is of course, self-conscious and embarrassed that he caught her like this, even as he tries to reassure her that it was beautiful to see her that way—the very reason he walked in was that he was so turned on that he wanted to have sex right then and there.
-   The _Discworld_ fic _The Graduation Class_, by A.A. Pessimal, explores one of _those_ little social embarrassments that are never, ever, talked about.

Miss Alice Band is faced with this dilemma with her room-mate and turns over some possible reactions in her mind...
    -   The same author mentions a scene where a group of female teachers are comparing notes concerning their respective schools. All are female, young enough to be attractive, and experienced enough to accept it happens with adolescent boys. The general consensus is expressed by a practically-minded Quirmian:
        
        _Ma Foi! The kind way is to pretend to be unaware it happens but to privately take it as a compliment. Boys will be boys, after all, and a boy of fourteen who does not relieve his physical need is an un-natural boy. If he thinks of me while he is doing it, it is a compliment!_
        
        ''Alice had agreed, relating what the Guild laundress had said to her about "it's true young boys are the focus for poltergeist activity, as the wizards say, miss. There's always a lot of bumping in the night, by all accounts, and lots of ectoplasm on their bedsheets the next morning!"

She figures it out within seconds: Luna walked in on Sundance (her roommate) and Hoyden (Sundance's coltfriend) mating (capping her long streak of luck walking in on them being romantic). In order to help avoid awkwardness, Celestia assigns Luna to duties that require her to leave Canterlot for a while.
-   Narrowly avoided in _RWBY: Scars_. Pyrrha knocks on Weiss' dorm door during a private moment, but Weiss had locked her door beforehand. It's a bit embarrassing for Weiss but Pyrrha didn't notice anything amiss.

    **Connie:** _\[deadpan\]_ Huh so that's how they do it...
    
-   At the start of _The Unfantastic Adventures of Bizarro No. 1_, Bizarro's son walks in on his father watching a porno movie with his pants down. Bizarro proceeds to swiftly pull his pants up, smash the monitor and ask: "What porno movies?"

    -   A similar moment occurs when one of Frank's friends charges his classmates to peep on his older sisters as they prepare for a bath.

    **Ned:** That would never have happened if you were wearing your slippers.

One thing leads to another, and eventually George's mother comes home and catches him masturbating, which shocks her so much it causes her to fall over and injure herself. Jerry is far more hung up on the fact that George was masturbating to _Glamour_ in the first place than he is about anything else.
    -   In "The Hamptons", Jerry's girlfriend walks in on George while he's changing after going swimming. While being seen naked would be embarrassing enough on its own, George also happened to be suffering "shrinkage" from being in the cold water, making the situation exponentially worse as it actually causes the girl to _laugh_ when she gets a glimpse of him down there.
        
        **George:** _\[calling desperately after her\]_ _**I WAS IN THE POOL! I WAS IN THE POOL!**_

-   In the _Stargate Atlantis_ episode "Grace Under Pressure", Rodney McKay is badly injured and hallucinates seeing his long-time crush, Samantha Carter. Even though he's well aware that she's just a figment of his imagination, he works with 'her' to try to help his situation. When 'Samantha' comes up with an idea that gives him much-needed extra time, he jumps up and hugs 'her'. He suddenly turns serious and moves in for an amorous kiss, but 'Samantha' spoils the mood by pointing out, "You do realize what you're doing here, right?" Possibly only a partial example, because the person who caught him was actually his own subconscious. (Rodney was a complicated guy.)
    
    **Rodney**: You are the worst hallucination ever!
    
-   Implied in an episode of _Supernatural_, although when two male characters who aren't having sex spend all their time together, it's to be expected.

-   The _Daily Mail Island_ sketch from _TV Go Home_ has a particularly horrifying example, where a teenage girl is caught masturbating by her parents ("She was debasing _everything_!

    Well it seems last night you caught me spankin' it // No use denyin' it, I was really crankin' it // Well, dry your eyes, don't be so sad, // if you could just forgive me, and talk to me, Dad.

During the mission brief, Yusuf Amir, the mission's boss, is not wearing any pants while partaking in cocaine and a prostitute's services, with his father, Abdul, later walking in on him, showing disappointment in Yusuf's hedonistic lifestyle.
    
    **Yusuf:** Don't judge a book by its cover, Father. That's what you taught me.  
    **Abdul:** When a book is called "Guns, Drugs, Hookers and No Pants" I think I don't need to read it.
    
-   A downplayed example In _Kathy Rain_. As the titular character makes her escape from the Sheriff Station's lock-up, she walks past Sheriff Boyks' office and overhears him in the middle of what is heavy implied to be a bit of Intimate Telecommunications.

-   In _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_, Bishop gets walked in on by his killers and he pulls his pants up and buckles his belt in a hurry, saying that he "was just doing inventory". Travis later gets caught by Henry while watching his Magical Girl Anime. If you listen closely, they were both watching the same thing, _Bizarre Jelly 5_.

However, she seems to be pretty into it the second time (at least) and is quite peeved when Aoi demands she stop.
-   In _Katawa Shoujo_, the first sex scene with Rin Tezuka begins like this. Hisao goes one night into her atelier and finds her naked save for her see-through shirt, barely lucid after spending several days trying to gain inspiration, and attempting to relieve herself with masturbation... or something similar, since she has no arms.

    **Critic:** ...this is awkward.
    
-   _Sonichu_ GET AWAY FROM THE INTERNET! I'M CUTTIN' IT DOWN! The general consensus is that Bob never actually caught on that Chris was masturbating, so this is kind of an odd example.
-   In _Survival of the Fittest_, this happens to Beth Vanallen - as Melina Frost walks in her. Particularly squicky as Melina then forces her to _keep going_ before effectively _joining in_. Depraved Bisexual indeed... Oh, and Melina uses a vase to help.
-   On _Not Always Right_, this woman is outraged at the appearance of pay-for-play pornography on her satellite TV bills, and even more so when the customer service representative asks if her adolescent son might be to blame.

    Western Animation 

-   In _The Amazing World of Gumball_ episode "The Shell", Gumball accidentally walks in on Banana Joe watching a video of a peeled orange being pulled apart. Considering that he treats taking his peel off like getting naked and has a box of tissues next to him... you get the idea.
-   An entire episode of _American Dad!_ is dedicated to masturbation. Stan reveals he has never masturbated before in his life and rather has repressed his urges through other, more 'wholesome' activities. In an attempt to instill this mentality in Steve, he tries to teach him woodcraft. Stan directs Steve to plunge a hot poker into a piece of wood that is held directly over Stan's lap, resulting in obvious (and painful) injury. The doctor gives him a special cream which he mistakenly thinks he must rub over the 'affected area' each day, essentially masturbating with lubricant. Stan soon becomes addicted to it and attempts to masturbate at any chance he can get.

    **Malory:** What was that?  
    **Archer:** Nothing.

    **Lois:** Oh my...  
    **Peter:** Do we... Do we rub his nose in it?
    
-   _Metalocalypse_:
    -   "Dethhealth" has a variation on this with Murderface.

There was also a fireman, his grandma, Obama, _The Golden Girls_, and other weird things.
    -   The episode where the band discusses "s\*cking their own c\*cks". It's time to take off for a show, Charles goes to gather the boys, only to find each in their room in a compromising position.
-   Happens to Orel in the "second" episode of _Moral Orel_ in the school bathroom by the janitor, which leads to the episode's... plot.
-   _Rick and Morty_ has these occasionally, generally involving the 14-year-old Morty. In one flashback, his 17-year-old sister Summer walks in on him. Although the context isn't necessary to understand the scene, it is worth mentioning that the flashback is shown in an episode where psychic alien parasites are altering people's memories to trick potential hosts into trusting them, sometimes convincing a person they've known the parasite for decades. The heroes eventually realize the parasites can only create _good_ memories, providing the protagonists with a way to figure out who's real and who's fake.
    
    **Summer:** Oh my god!  
    **Morty:** I thought you went to a concert!  
    **Summer:** We forgot the tickets! Why in the kitchen?!  
    **Morty:** I do it everywhere! Stop shaming me!  
    **Summer:** You're not the victim here!  
    **Morty:** I hate you and I was thinking about your friend Grace!  
    **Summer:** _\[inarticulate scream\]_
    
    -   Used bizarrely in the Season 3 Opening Credits, where Morty is shown (from behind) to be watching a video on a PornHub-colored site which features a woman pulling down underwear to reveal faces on each buttcheek. Cue Beth walking in, and he immediately slams the laptop closed and pretends to be asleep (and we can now see that he and Beth both have butts on their faces). Clearly, this is some alternate Morty's version of this trope.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   In an episode, after Bart had walked in on his parents having sex, Milhouse assures him that it's better to walk in on both your parents rather than just one.
    -   "Like Father, Like Clown" parodies this with a flashback where Hyman Krustofski catches his son playing with a seltzer bottle in the bathroom, which is a parody of a scene in the play Brighton Beach Memoirs where this trope is played straight.
-   _South Park_:
    -   In "Over Logging", Randy has gone for weeks without masturbating to internet porn, eventually near the end he sneaks into the camp's computer room, looks at a bunch of perverted things, and eventually ejaculates all over the room, everyone comes in thinking he was grunting in pain and with his pants down, he tells them that he was doing that because "a ghost was attacking him and left his ectoplasm everywhere".
    -   This was played for drama in an earlier episode when Butters caught his father masturbating in a gay bathhouse while he was _completely naked_. Butters didn't quite understand what was going on, but his father was mortified and ashamed.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: Even SpongeBob gets caught once in a while. The beginning of "Your Shoe's Untied" shows him relaxing in his easy chair, intensely watching a live-action anemone on TV. The anemone is gyrating to go-go music. SpongeBob leans forward, wide-eyed and smiling broadly... then his pet snail Gary slithers in.
    
    **SpongeBob:** _\[switching the channel\]_ I...I was just looking for the sports channel, Gary!
    
-   _The Venture Brothers_ has The Monarch watching Dr. Girlfriend seducing Dr. Venture on a video monitor. He starts rubbing his chest, his hand drifts downward...and stops abruptly when a henchman passes through.
