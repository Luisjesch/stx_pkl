_"There was a long period of time during which nothing much happened."_

A Time Skip is similar to the Distant Finale, but rather than coming at the end of a series, occurs somewhere in the middle, usually between seasons or Story Arcs. A Time Skip can also happen when a series gets a sequel that picks up after the Distant Finale. Naturally, this occurs far more in animated series and comics than in live action, unless a long period of time passes in real life. A mid-series Time Skip in a manga usually causes a break between series in the anime adaptation. It's also a common point in the story for filler to be fitted in.

A Time Skip also provides another advantage for animated series that isn't necessary for live-action series: after a certain number of episodes have passed it looks more and more ridiculous that the characters haven't aged. However, animation does not really allow for the extremely subtle effect of gradual aging. Thus, the best way to show aging has happened is to jump ahead to when they're older.

A Time Skip usually takes no less than three years, and may indicate a shift in the Competence Zone, or at least the characters' place in it. The Official Couple now has a kid, the kid sister... Wow! She Is All Grown Up! When a time skip occurs in a Shōnen anime or manga, you can bet that almost the entire cast will have Taken a Level in Badass.

Time Skips can cause/result in a dramatic shift in the tone of a series, especially if the main characters were kids or teenagers. Alternately, it can be a "The Next Generation" situation, with the children of the previous protagonists taking up the mantle of their parents. A common device of such a variation has the previous protagonists realizing that they now have to put up with the same shenanigans they put their own parents/commanding officers through.

A time skip may be used as well to link the origin story and the story itself, when the story does not take place immediately after the origin. Instead of using a Flashback within the main story, the story details the origin story at the beginning and provides a "many years later" screen to jump to the main story.

Tends to be used as a follow up to a Wham Episode.

Often leads to Ridiculously Successful Future Self for one or more characters.

In a story that runs on Webcomic Time, an occasional periodic Time Skip is almost a requirement to keep the time frame current with the real world. Some don't bother. Alternatively, multiple time skips can be chained together in any medium to produce a story with a larger time span at the expense of insignificant events between major plot turns — see Dashed Plot Line.

Thanks to the nature of time flowing forward and that ugly process known as "aging", live-action works can use a Time Skip to help make Role Reprises feasible in the event of a Sequel Gap.

Longer time skips tend to be a round number of years. See also: Offstage Waiting Room. And check for eyepatches. If the Time Skip is especially lengthy, see Distant Sequel.

A time skip that doesn't get covered in enough detail tends to be prime Fanfic Fuel. If canon doesn't have a time skip yet, fans may just write their own future scenarios for the characters in Flash Forward Fic.

Contrast Spin-Off Babies, which instead makes the characters younger, and Bait-and-Switch Time Skip, which only _looks like_ a long period of time has passed.

    Comic Books 

-   _Age of the Wolf_: The three stories have around a 15-20-year gap between them, showing the heroine aging from someone barely out of her teens to an old woman.
-   The _All-New, All-Different Marvel_ relaunch picks up eight months after the most recent Crisis Crossover, _Secret Wars (2015)_, with the time gap leading every returning title to change its status quo in some way, such as Parker Industries going from a struggling business to an international success. Many of the changes were explored further in flashbacks, but a few were never really explained.
-   _The Avengers_ #35 and _New Avengers_ #24 take place eight months after their respective previous issues, additionally teasing different changes in the status quo of the Marvel Universe that would later come to be in other titles in the following months, including Superior Iron Man, Thor losing his arm, the Fantastic Four going back to blue costumes. To avoid spoiling some of these changes, special Superior Iron Man, Tony Stark didn't appear in _The Avengers_ or _New Avengers_ until _Superior Iron Man_ #1 was published.
-   _Dawn of the Jedi_ ends up skipping the initial invasion. At the start of "Force War", the Rakata and the Je'daii have already been fighting for a year. The authors presumably rushed things so they could finish the storyline before Lucasfilm/Disney cancelled the series, which indeed happened.
-   _Image_ published the _Images of Tomorrow_ event with _Bloodstrike #25_, _Brigade #25_, _Stormwatch #25_ and _Supreme #25_, skipping ahead a year or more with major changes shown in these future stories, in an attempt to lead up to these future issues. _Stormwatch_ had a smooth transition to its future issue, _Supreme_ dismissed its issue as just a dream; _Brigade_ and _Bloodstrike_ didn't made it to #25.
-   The entire DC Universe jumped forwards a year following the Crisis Crossover _Infinite Crisis_, during which time Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman were out of commission. The weekly limited series _52_ filled in the events of the missing year in real time through the eyes of several minor characters.
-   In _Jupiter's Legacy_, the plot skips forward nine years after Walter and Brandon's coup.
-   _Legends of Baldur's Gate_: The comics are set decades after the games from which they were spun off. Minsc, the main link between them, spent the intervening time up as a statue which Delina, the main new character, accidentally brings back to life.
-   The fourth volume of the Pre-Crisis _Legion of Super-Heroes_ began with the words "Five Years Later", leading into a controversial Darker and Edgier revamp of the series. The Animated Adaptation also has a timeskip between seasons, or rather, _two_ timeskips in one: the second season takes place a couple of years after the first, and when the new Big Bad arises, Superman is brought back from the 21st century... but where season one Supes had been pulled from his Smallville days, season two Supes has been pulled from his Justice League days. Where everyone else has aged two years, Superman has aged about ten and goes from being the least experienced member of the team to an Older and Wiser adult hero.
-   _The New Universe_ was supposed to take place in real time, with each book happening in the current month. However, the writer of _D.P. 7_ decided that that was just a general guideline with the main thing being that one year in comic book time equaling one year in real life. His first story arc took about nine issues (9 months) but only lasted a few weeks in-story, so to catch up with the rest of the New Universe there is a time skip to the following year after that arc.
-   _Noble Causes_: The last eight issues, vol. 2 #33-40, take place five years after #32, during which time Rusty loses his humanity and starts acting like a robot, Frost becomes an accepted member of the family, and at least three marriages happen.
-   _Quantum and Woody_ skipped ahead to #37 after #17, then attempted to fill in the gap from #18-21 before being cancelled. _Q2: The Return of Quantum and Woody_ takes place twenty years later.
-   _Runaways_: Terry Moore's second arc jumps forward an uncertain amount of time, as demonstrated by the fact that Karolina has apparently gotten over Xavin and Klara has become acclimated enough to the modern world that she's able to beat Victor at videogames.
-   _Scooby Apocalypse_: Issue #21 jumps ahead two months from the end of Issue #20, but the most significant time skip is the six-month leap between Issues #25 and #26. Following Fred's death, the gang was able to successfully take control of the mall and the location is now a base of operations and is on its way to becoming a true survivors' encampment as Velma had hoped, currently housing of hundreds of humans who have managed to find their way to Albany. Oh, and Velma and Shaggy are now a couple.
-   _Secret Wars (2015)_: The first issue takes place during the incursion between the Marvel Universe and the Ultimate Universe. The next four issues take place eight years later, on God-Emperor Doom's Battleworld, formed from the remains of the destroyed multiverse. During this time, the two life rafts containing survivors of both the Marvel and Ultimate universes (led by Mister Fantastic and The Maker, respectively) were discovered and opened, causing chaos. Issue six jumps ahead three weeks, after a manhunt was issued for the Incursion survivors, framing them for the murder of Sheriff Strange (Doom secretly killed him).
-   _Sillage_: There's a time skip between issue #7 and #8. In this time, the mentor of Nävis, Mackel-Loos, died.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_ did an interesting variation of this: at the end of issue #125, Sonic is teleported across the universe, and spends the next several issues making his way back to Mobius. In issue #130 he finally makes it home, only to discover that — due to relativity — what had been a few weeks for him was actually a whole year on Mobius, during which many things had changed.
-   _Sonic the Comic_: Sonic and his friends were sent forwards into the future by Dr Robotnik in one of the earliest issues, during which time he had managed to make himself emperor of Mobius.
-   _Spider-Man: Brand New Day_ starts 100 days after Spider-Man was last seen by the public.
-   _The Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows_: After issue 12, the series skips ahead eight years to have Annie May Parker as a teenager.
-   In _Supergirl_ series:
    -   _Bizarrogirl_ begins six weeks pass after the end of _New Krypton_, a time during which Kara went missing.
    -   _Supergirl: Cosmic Adventures in the 8th Grade_, several months pass between issues #4 and #5.
    -   _Death & the Family_: The third issue begins two days after the ending of the second one.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage)_: The third volume starts fifteen years after the last one; its sister title _Tales of the TMNT_ sometimes fills in the gap with stories taking place during the Time Skip.
-   _The Transformers (IDW)_ skipped forward three years between the end of _The Transformers: All Hail Megatron_ and the start of the ongoing series. _The Transformers: Last Stand of the Wreckers_ has a few flashbacks that take place during the time skip.
-   Ultimate Marvel:
    -   _Ultimate Spider-Man_ Volume 3 has a one-year time skip between #22 and #23 after Rio Morales dies.
    -   _Ultimate FF_: Sue gets pregnant in Issue #5. Issue #6 takes place nine months later (no wonder why).
-   The _X-Men_ family of comic books used a time skip for a revamp of the line in 2000. It was only six months, but is still worth mentioning since it was uniform across all the X-Men spinoffs. Its success at revamping the titles is dubious; two were cancelled the following year, and another was revamped again. In part the Time Skip was used to introduce changes to line-ups and characters that supposedly happened in the intervening time, and which (according to the plan) were eventually going to be explained. For example, the X-Men had lost 1990s member Marrow and gained a rookie member in Thunderbird III, and reserve members Forge, Moonstar, and Tessa (Sage). Cable redefined himself and his mission following the supposed deaths of Apocalypse and Cyclops, Colossus had developed an Unrequited Love for Rogue, Nightcrawler had become a priest, Phoenix and Psylocke had somehow exchanged powers, and Shadowcat had received an Important Haircut and Took Levels in Badass and Jerkass. Most of the changes were never actually explained and in retrospect served mostly to confuse the readers.

    Comic Strips 

-   From the newspaper comics, _Funky Winkerbean_ was Frozen in Time for many years, following its High School cast. Then, out of the blue, it time-skipped nearly 20 years, almost re-syncing with real time, and follows both those same kids as parents, and their kids as well, attending the same high school. It was frozen for another stretch, but at the conclusion of a long story arc that ended in a character's death from cancer, it skipped another ten years. The intervening years are occasionally covered as flashbacks.

    Fan Works 

-   _Adventures of a Super Family_: After the first few scenes, the action jumps ahead six years in the future.
-   _Advice and Trust_: A minor in chapter 5. The last segment happens several weeks after the former.
-   Subverted in _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_, where Calvin and Hobbes are shown to have been stranded for 50 years, having to fend off their insane parents and eat tires for nutrition. It turns to have been All Just a Dream of Calvin's, though.
-   _A Crown of Stars_: Chapter 66 features two time-skips. The beginning of the chapter happens two weeks after the end of the former chapter. And the second scene happens five weeks after the first one.
-   _Always Visible_: It plays out in a strange way in the third act, when Galbraith gets into a taxi and ends up moving forward two months, with everyone around thinking that the inspector himself simply does not remember the current date.
-   _AIEchidna's Five Nights at Freddy's_ does this with almost every new entry, _Withered_ taking place four years after _Nightmare_, _Refurbished_ and _Afton_ taking place 6 years after _Withered_, _Springlocked_ has two, the prelude taking place 12 years after _Refurbished_ and the rest of the story taking place 18 years after _that_, and _Finale_ takes place 3 years after _Springlocked_.
-   _Darth Vader: Shattered Galaxy_ picks up five years after the end of _Darth Vader: Hero of Naboo_.
-   _Daylight Burning_: The story is set about eight years after the show's second season, which had been airing when it was written. As such, the characters are all aged up and have progressed through their lives to various degrees, such Twilight having gotten a grant to build a university in Ponyville, Fluttershy going through med school and working as a doctor's assistant, Rainbow Dash having gone through a relationship and bad breakup with Spitfire, and Spike having matured into a teenaged dragon and training in the Guard.
-   _The Devil's in the details_: While the events of _Far From Home_ still happened, the series completely skips over it, Peter describing what happened to Matt in "Returning Home".
-   _Diary of a Wimpy Kid: 25 Years Later_: As the title suggests, it takes place 25 years from the original series.
-   _A Diplomatic Visit_: The first chapter of the fourth story, _The Diplomat's Life_, picks up a few months after the end of the previous story. There's a few more later, including a six-year one between the final battle with the Pony of Shadows and the events of the epilogue.
-   After Chapter 10.7 in _Don't Lose Your Heart_, there's a nine year time skip to the events of the first _Kingdom Hearts_ game.
-   The _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ novel has a ten-year time skip between the final chapter and the epilogue, where Empath and Smurfette's wedding takes place. The other stories in the series are written to fill in the gap of that 10-year time period, to see how Empath and Smurfette progressed.
-   _The Equestrian Wind Mage_: Season 3 jumps ahead five years after the end of Season 2, when the long promised bridging of worlds between Equestria and Hyrule occurs, setting the stage for the final conflict between the heroes and the forces of the Church of Majora. Though this is something of a downplayed example, as the author also has Season 2.5, a series of interludes that expands on what happened during those years.
-   _Extended Stay_ starts off in relatively normal time, but begins to skip ahead in time after Chapter 10. Chapter 11 skips ahead to approximately six months after the Mistress discovers she is pregnant. The next two chapters take place a month after Chapter 11. Chapter 14 takes place four years after Chapter 13 and Chapter 15 takes place sixteen years after Chapter 14.
-   _The Forbidden Drink_: The sequel, _Return of the Titans_, picks up a month after the end of the first story.
-   _Ghosts of Evangelion_: Due to the nature of the story — it being a collection of small vignettes — this happens frequently. Most notably, the story at one point skips from Shinji and Asuka's daughter's adolescence in the 40's to her parents' demises in 2080.
-   _HERZ_: The epilogue happens twenty years after the events of chapter 12.
-   In _Hater Good Side Story Swayed Decisions_, a _Breadwinners_ and _Pickle and Peanut_ crossover, there is a time skip at the end of SwaySway and Sophee as middle aged adults being close friends again.
-   _House of Summers_: "Wait For Me" begins eight years after the end of "The Girl From Tomorrow". "Heart Sees Through Lies" is set twelve years after "Wait For Me".
-   _The Immortal Game_ skips ahead a month after the defeat of Nihilus. And after the Final Battle, the story cuts ahead a few weeks to show everyone adjusting to the post-war world and rebuilding. Then the last scene skips ahead an unspecified amount of time (long enough to completely restore Canterlot) to Alicorn!Twilight's coronation.
-   _Jewel of Darkness_ starts out when Raven was a little girl, but after a few chapters skips ahead several years to when she's a teenager for the "present" of the story. There's another skip of several months between the Jump City and Rivalry arcs, meant to simulate the break between seasons of the show.
-   _Limitless Potential_ has a 10-year gap between chapters 21 and 22, the latter entering the timeframe of the events of the Day of Sigma OVA in _Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X_.
-   _Mega Man Reawakened_ has two months pass between Arcs 3 and 4.
-   _My Family and Other Equestrians_ takes place before the "Equestria Games" episode of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_. After chapter 76, the story skips to the end of the season (so the Games and the battle with Tirek happen during this time) and shortly after the beginning of the following season.
-   The _My Hostage, Not Yours_ series skips several months between the first two stories, and a couple of years between the second and third stories.
-   The epilogue of _My Little Avengers_ skips ahead the better part of a year after Loki's defeat.
-   _Naru-Hina Chronicles_: Chapter 9 takes place one year after Chapter 8 and is appropriately titled "One Year Later...".
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide_:
    -   Chapter 1 starts out a while after the death of Kaworu. After Shinji visits Asuka while she's hospitalized, the story skips ahead several weeks.
    -   The epilogue happens three years after the final battle.
-   _The Night Unfurls_: In order to advance the plot, the training montage of Kyril's 4 apprentices are cut short into a couple of lessons and combat scenes, in order to avoid describing the "gitting gud" process one is expected to experience when playing _Bloodborne_.
-   _Out Of The Shadows_: This story is set roughly a couple of months after the end of the first movie.
-   The fanfic _Path of the Tyrant_ happens 10 years after _The Assassination of Twilight Sparkle_.
-   An in-universe example in _Pokémon Strangled Red_. After Miki dies in a trading accident, a year passes in the hacked game. Interestingly, the skipped year is tacked onto _gameplay_ time.
-   There is an unspecified but seemingly years-long gap between _Rolling in Beaches_ and _Atlas Strongest Tournament_.
-   _MLP Next Generation: Love Conquers All! Avarice Takes It All!_ picks up six months after the previous story left off.
-   The _Contractually Obligated Chaos_ series sees roughly three and a half years pass between the end of the first story and the start of the second, then four months between the end of the second and the start of the third.
-   _SAPR_: After the fic's version of the Battle of Beacon the story skips ahead several months in order to mimic the time skip that happened in _RWBY_ canon.
-   In _Sonic X: Dark Chaos_, there are short indeterminate time skips between most of the episodes. Only Episodes 55/56 and the episodes after 74 directly follow each other.
-   _Star Wars vs. Warhammer 40K_: Around halfway through the tenth episode, the entire story jumps ahead to weeks after the Senate became gridlocked in response to the Imperium's invasion of the Axum system. This is done to show the fallout of the Imperial occupation of Axum — the Republic is facing a sudden refugee crisis caused by civilians who fled Axum before it fell, while the Imperials have had time to entrench themselves on Axum and start purging the planet's non-human population. Most of the Imperial invasion force has moved on since then, leaving behind only a token garrison to defend their newly conquered holdings, presenting the Jedi with the opportunity to launch a counter-invasion to retake Axum and force the Senate to break their weeks-long deadlock.
-   _The Stars Will Aid Their Escape_ starts out shortly after Trixie ran away from Ponyville; after she gets the _Neighcronomicon_ from Herald, it skips ahead two years.
-   In _The Swarm of War_, at the end of the first arc the Overmind rules the planet, but cannot expand beyond until he consumes enough of the Warp Storm surrounding it to clear the way. It takes decades, but of course there isn’t much to tell about.
-   _Us and Them_:
    -   Following the Shinra raid on Corel, the story skips ahead ten years where we meet seventeen-year-old Aeris arriving in Midgar.
    -   After getting stranded on the Twin Planet, there's a skip of two years while Aeris and Sephiroth try to find a way to get back to Gaia.
-   _Villain Song (Roving Otter)_ : The movie is set eight years after Magnifico’s downfall and imprisonment.
-   The first fourteen chapters of _The Vow_ tell how Lord Shen and Lady Lianne meet, fall in love and are almost married, but Shen's canon banishment happens anyway in the end of the 14th chapter. The 15th chapter is used to narrate pithily how Lianne and Shen spend their three decades of separation, after which their story is included to the movie's plot. Later in the last chapter's epilogue, five years pass after Shen is forced to live imprisoned in Lianne's — who has become his wife — home with her and their son Zian before we reach the final scene.
-   _Young Justice: Darkness Falls_: There're three significant time skips within the story. One is from January to March, marking the leadup to Darkseid's first attack. Then there's the time between March and July where the League is mostly just training and rebuilding, and not much else is happening around the world. Finally there's a timeskip between the end of _Retaliation_ and the epilogue of 9 months.
-   _Zim the Warlord: Irken Reversion_ does this between its first two chapters, as Chapter 1 ends with Zim going into a coma that lasts 6 months, which he awakens from at the start of Chapter 2.
-   _Zootopia 2 The Movie_ takes place two years after the Nighthowler case.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Black Fox_ skips twice, with one passing from Rikka's Minor Kidtroduction to her Dangerous 16th Birthday, and then one more that moves to six months after, where the meat of the story takes place.
-   _Cars 2_ takes place four years after the first movie where Lightning has since won four Piston Cups. The third takes place six years after the second, where he is now a 7-time Piston Cup winner.
-   _Coco_: The epilogue skips forward to the next Dia de los Muertos, one year later.
-   Numerous examples from the Disney Animated Canon, frequently via a Time Skip song:
    -   A time skip occurs in _Bambi_ after his mother dies, and he appears as a fully mature buck. No montage here; just a hard cut. A midquel was made much later to fill in some of the time frame.
    -   In _The Fox and the Hound_ when Amos Slade takes Copper away for a hunting trip.
    -   In _The Lion King (1994)_ during "Hakuna Matata", we see Simba mature from a cub into an adult lion. Again, like with _Bambi_ a midquel shows some of the time frame in between.
    -   In _Hercules_ during "One Last Hope", a Training Montage takes Hercules from awkward teenager to buff and accomplished adult. The animated series spinoff is set during this time.
    -   In _Tarzan_ during "Son of Man", Tarzan develops from young boy to adult man, developing all the skills he needs to survive in the jungle, and inventing some other ones. This _also_ got a midquel placed in-between.
    -   In _Frozen_ during "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?", Anna grows from five to eighteen via a montage of her knocking on Elsa's door and asking the song's title, while Elsa is instead educated in repressing her powers. It also covers the death and funeral of their parents in the meantime, which sets up the rest of the film's plot.
    -   _Frozen II_ takes place three years after the end of the first movie. This is confirmed in the film itself, where Anna and Elsa say that their parents died six years ago; in the original film, it had been three years since the Queen and King were lost at sea.
    -   In _Moana_ during "Where You Are", which speedily covers Moana's growth, education, and conflict between the draw of the ocean and requirements of her people. And also the consideration of coconuts.
-   _Finding Dory_ briefly opens with Dory's childhood, showing how she got separated from her parents. The rest of the film is set a year after the events of _Finding Nemo_.
-   _Hey Arnold! The Jungle Movie_ takes place roughly a year after the events _Hey Arnold!_'s final episode "The Journal". Arnold has just finished fifth grade, having previously been in fourth grade.
-   _Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa_ opens with Alex's childhood back in Africa, where he is captured by poachers and sent to New York City. The specifics are unknown, but it happens before the September 11 attacks (the WTC Twin Towers can be seen). The film then cuts to the aftermath of the first film.
-   There is a timeskip of five years between _How to Train Your Dragon_ and _How to Train Your Dragon 2_, featuring new designs for the grown up protagonists. The third film, on the other hand, takes place a year after the second.
-   _Puss in Boots: The Last Wish_ takes place quite a while after _Puss in Boots_. The latter is set before _Shrek_, while the former is set after _Shrek Forever After_, during which time we see Shrek and Fiona meet, fall in love, and start a family of three children, so the time skip is at least several years. Puss also sounds significantly older, as _The Last Wish_ is released eleven years after its predecessor.
-   _Rise of the Guardians_ opens three centuries before present, when Jack Frost is granted his powers by the Man on the Moon.
-   _Space Chimps 2: Zartog Strikes Back_ takes place two years after the events of the first movie.
-   _Steven Universe: The Movie_ takes place two years after the end of the series' fifth season.
-   The unofficial sequel to The Tale of Peter Rabbit by GoldenFilms shows Peter and Mopsy, Flopsy, and Cottontail as older children (possibly in their teen years), judging by their voices.
-   There was a huge jump in time between _Toy Story 2_ and _Toy Story 3_, most notably with Andy having already graduated high school and going off to college. This was done to mesh with real time, since most of the kids who watched the first two movies _are_ already in college. Additionally, the voice actor for Andy had grown up and they wanted to use his voice for all three movies, so it made perfect sense that Andy had grown up to match his voice actor.
-   In _Turning Red_, there is a short one of a week between Tyler's birthday party on May 18, 2002 and the day of the 4\*Town concert. There is another right after the climax which skips to a few weeks or months later.
-   _Ralph Breaks the Internet_ is set six years after _Wreck-It Ralph_, matching the real-life gap between the two films.
-   _Your Name_ jumps forward in time 5 years 8 for Mitsuha and the Itomori residents for the final part after the evacuation of Itomori.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Amazing Spider-Man_ begins with Peter Parker as a child being dropped off to Uncle Ben's house by his parents, who are killed in a plane accident shortly after. The sequel does this again, only this time from the perspective of Peter's parents, revealing exactly how they died.
-   _Armageddon (1998)_ starts out showing the world of the dinosaurs being destroyed by an asteroid... followed by the title card "65 Million Years Later".

-   _Black Angel Vol. 1_ starts with the newborn Ikko being abducted from the hospital, then jumps ahead six years to Ikko witnessing the massacre of her family and being smuggled out of the country by her father's agents. It then jumps ahead fourteen years to the 20 year-old Ikko returning to Tokyo to start her Roaring Rampage of Revenge.
-   _A Bronx Tale_ has the first act with the main character as a 10-year-old, and a second where he's 17.
-   _Capps Crossing_: The movie's prologue is set one year ago. The movie itself is stated to be set in the present day.
-   The film _Cast Away_ has a four-year skip in the middle of it, between Tom Hanks' initial efforts to survive on the island, and his eventual escape from it.
-   _Christmas Blood_: The prologue is stated to take place on Christmas Eve, 2011, where we see the Santa Claus killer murder his latest victim and get caught and shot by the police. The movie then jumps forward to Christmas Eve, 2016.
-   _Claw (2021)_: After Julia and Kyle survive their ordeal with the raptor, the film jumps ahead a year to show them in LA, with Julia being welcomed to perform on-stage at a comedy club. Though this is actually a dream Julia's having.
-   _Clownface_: After Clownface kills Rick and kidnaps Zoe, the film jumps ahead one year.
-   _Clown Kill_: The film begins in a bar, and then jumps ahead six months to when Jenny returns to work.
-   _The Conjuring Universe_:
    -   _The Conjuring 2_ opens in 1976, as the Warrens deal with the Amityville case, five years after the previous film. It then jumps to a year later, the setting of the Enfield Poltergeist.
    -   _The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It_ is set in 1981. The Warrens' daughter, who is last seen as a teenager, has graduated from high school and is attending college.
    -   Most of _Annabelle: Creation_ is set in 1955, but the opening is set in 1943, and the ending skips to 1958, then 1970 (the setting of the first film).
-   _The Dark Knight Rises_ takes place 8 years after _The Dark Knight_ (twice the real-time gap between films). A Freeze-Frame Bonus in the second film establishes that film's year as 2008, putting the events of _Rises_ in 2016, possibly into 2017 and the main events of _Begins_ in 2007. However, it takes place 9 years after _Batman Begins_, and was released seven years after said film. _Batman Begins_ itself opens with Bruce Wayne's childhood, showing the accident at the well and his witness of his parents' murders.
-   DC Extended Universe:
    -   _Man of Steel_ is told in an anachronistic order, with frequent cuts between important parts of Clark Kent's life, including as a baby crash landing on Smallville, then a kid, a teenager, and finally an adult.
    -   _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ begins in 1981, with the murder and funeral of Thomas and Martha Wayne<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , then jumps forward to 2013, during the climax of _Man of Steel_, where we see General Zod's attack on Metropolis from the point of view of Bruce Wayne. The film then jumps forward 18 months, when the rest of the film is set.

After this ends, the film jumps to 1969 for the rest of the film, aside from a trip to 214 BC caused by the Dial.
-   _I Think I Do (1997)_ opens with the characters in college, when Bob makes a pass at Brendan that ends their friendship. The movie then skips ahead five years to when they meet again at their friends' wedding.
-   The James Bond series has had a few:
    -   _GoldenEye_ begins in 1986 with 007 and fellow agent 006/Alec Trevelyan infiltrating a Soviet chemical weapons factory, a mission that ends up going very wrong. The film then skips to 1995, where Bond is sent to investigate the theft of a prototype helicopter capable of resisting EMP attacks during a military demonstration in Monte Carlo and how it ended up in a radar facility in Siberia.
    -   There was a minor case in _Die Another Day_, where 18 months pass during the Artistic Titles.
    -   _No Time to Die_ has a couple — the first one from an undisclosed year (in which Madeleine Swann witnesses Lyutsifer Safin killing her mother) to the present day (in which Bond is ambushed in an Italian town visiting Vesper Lynd's tomb), and then a second one from that time to five years into the future, during which time Bond retires from MI6 service.
-   _Jumanji_:
    -   The first film has an intro in 1869, where the title game of doom is buried in the jungle. It then cuts to 1969, where the protagonist Alan finds Jumanji, and ends up sucked into it while playing with his friend Sarah.

-   _Killer Under the Bed_: The film begins with a girl hiding in a tool shed, then being accosted by an unseen attacker. Then the movie skips ahead one year.
-   _Killer/saurus_: After the intro scene plays, we get the title and opening credits. Then the movie skips ahead three months to Kayleigh and Jed waking up from their sleep.
-   The Marvel Cinematic Universe could technically be considered to have this trope between installments by virtue of the fact that, with few exceptions, the movie dates are released in accordance to their real life release date.
    -   _Captain America: The First Avenger_ is mostly a prequel to all of the other films, set during World War II. Then in the ending, Steve Rogers gets frozen in ice and wakes up during the 2010s...
    -   _Iron Man 3_ briefly opens on December 31, 1999, showing how pre-Character Development Tony Stark completely screws a guy and inadvertently leads to him becoming a villain.
    -   _Thor: The Dark World_ begins with Thor's grandfather defeating the Dark Elves led by Malekith, which happened thousands of years before the present day.
    -   The first scene of _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_ shows how a young Peter Quill gets taken by aliens.
    -   _Black Panther_ has two instances of this in the prologue. It begins thousands of years ago, as four African tribes that make up Wakanda are united by the first Black Panther. Then it skips to 1992, showing T'Chaka's tragic visit to his brother, N'Jobu, that will lead to problems in Wakanda's future. Then it skips once more to the present.
    -   The truest example of this in action is _Avengers: Endgame_, which jumps five years after the events of _Avengers: Infinity War_ from 2018 to 2023. Furthermore, despite the Timey-Wimey Ball at play, this remains completely _permanent_ in the end, setting the stage for the rest of the franchise going forward.

    -   _Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings_ starts in an unspecified year when Xu Wenwu finds the titular rings, followed him through history and ends with a scene in 1996 when he finds a village and fights its protector, with whom he would eventually father the eponymous character and his sister.

-   _None Shall Escape_—a 1944 film about a trial against a Nazi officer following the end of the then-ongoing second world war, told via flashbacks from the points of view of the witnesses at the trial—has several due to the story structure; each flashback/witness testimony is set a few years after the previous one. The first one by Father Warecki takes place in 1919 right after the end of WWI, the next one by Karl takes place in 1923 right before and after the Beer Hall Putsch before skipping ahead to 1929 and then to 1934 after the Night of the Long Knives, and the last one by Marja takes place during WWII.
-   _On the Buses_ films:

-   _Shredder Orpheus_ has a one-year time skip after Orpheus makes it out of the Underworld but loses Eurydice in the process, during which EBN gains even more broadcast control and Orpheus has become famous among the populace.
-   _Sniper The White Raven_ starts with the Russian invasion of the Donetsk region of Ukraine in 2014. "Raven" joins up, becomes a sniper, and goes on his first few missions. Then we get a black screen, and "Four years later," and a Sniper Duel. After that, we get a second time skip, to the Kiev region in February 2022, where Raven is still a sniper.
-   _Spotlight_ is mostly set in 2001, but the opening is set in 1976, showing how far back the Catholic Church has covered up the child sex abuse scandals in Boston.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   There is a three-year timeskip between the end original series (2266-2269) and _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_ (2272), then a larger skip to _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_ (2285, a gap of 13 years). _Khan_ directly follows into the next two films, but then there are further time skips over the other films, which are as follows:
    -   _The Motion Picture_ to _Star Trek II_ (2272 to 2285; 13 years)
    -   _Star Trek II_ to _Star Trek III: The Search for Spock_ (2285; both films happen right after each other)

    -   _First Contact_ to _Star Trek: Insurrection_ (2373 to 2375; 2 years)
    -   _Insurrection_ to _Star Trek: Nemesis_ (2375 to 2379; 4 years)
    -   The 2009 film starts with Kirk's birth in 2233 and the introduction of the main villain, then Kirk's childhood in the 2240s, then Spock's childhood, then Kirk in the bar fight (2255) and joining Starfleet, then three years after that (2258), the rest of the film. Later on, when Kirk meets Spock Prime, you could argue that the vision Spock shows him is another Time Skip, albeit one to an alternate future of 2387 (of the Shatner/Nimoy/Kelley _Trek_ timeline).
    -   _Star Trek Into Darkness_ picks up in 2259, six months after the events of the previous film. Incidentally, the real-life gap between filming was four years. Simon Pegg has even commented on the weirdness of picking up where they left off after such a relatively long break. Also, Kirk's speech at the end takes place in 2260, almost a year after the Vengeance crash-lands in San Francisco.
    -   _Star Trek Beyond_ begins about three years after the end of _Into Darkness_, in 2263.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   A ten-year gap between _The Phantom Menace_ and _Attack of the Clones_.
    -   A three-year gap between _Attack of the Clones_ and _Revenge of the Sith_.
    -   A nineteen-year gap between _Revenge of the Sith_ and _A New Hope_, the original Star Wars.
    -   Another three-year gap between _A New Hope_ and _The Empire Strikes Back_
    -   A one-year gap between _The Empire Strikes Back_ and _Return of the Jedi_
    -   A _thirty_\-year gap between _Return of the Jedi_ and _The Force Awakens_, matching the real-life Sequel Gap between the two movies.
    -   Averted with _The Last Jedi_, which begins immediately after the final scene in _The Force Awakens_.
    -   _The Rise of Skywalker_ picks up one year after _The Last Jedi_, during which, among other things, Rey's been honing her Force abilities.
-   _Strippers Vs. Werewolves_: The first scene of the movie is set in 1984, where we see a building called "Silvadollas" get blown up. Then it jumps ahead to 2011, where the bulk of the movie takes place. The movie skips ahead at the end to 2012, showing the surviving girls are now helping monster hunter Sinclair with his job as his werewolf posse.
-   _Terror Birds_: The intro of the movie shows the birds being airlifted to the ranch, then attacking some people who are supposed to be transporting them... then it skips ahead three months.
-   _Trick or Treats_: After Joan has Malcolm falsely committed to a mental hospital, the movie jumps ahead several years (it actually says that).
-   _Up the Front_: After Lurk is made a Colonel, the film jumps from 1914 to 1939.
-   The _Veronica Mars_ movie takes place at Veronica's ten-year high school reunion, nine years after the events at the end of the show's final season. Interestingly, this means that the film takes place in Next Sunday A.D., since Veronica graduated in the class of '06, so the film released in 2014 is presumably set in 2016 (although they don't say it outright).
-   _Werewolves Within_: The movie starts with a man being attacked and dragged off-screen by an unseen assailant. Then it jumps ahead 29.5 days.
-   _Why Don't You Play in Hell?_ jumps forward ten years after the first act, then does a little hand-holding to introduce the new actors playing the younger characters, even though they wear the exact same outfits as before.
-   _Wolves_: Cayden is a high school senior at the beginning, but later dialogue indicates he's in his early twenties. The extra time most likely elapsed during the Fugitive Arc.
-   _Women Is Losers_: At his urging, Celina has sex with Mateo on the roof after agreeing that she wants her first time with him.
-   _Wrath of the Titans_ takes place 10 years after the first film and also gives Perseus a 10-year-old son to boot.
-   _X-Men Film Series_: There can be fairly long gaps of time within the individual stories and in between some movies.
    -   _X-Men_: It begins in 1944, and then jumps to 2005.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   _X-Men Origins: Wolverine_: There is a 6-year gap after Logan quits Team X, but it hasn't been made clear when precisely in the The '70s and/or The '80s the story takes place.
    -   _X-Men: First Class_: Has a few scenes in 1944, and then moves forward to 1962.
    -   _The Wolverine_: There is a flashback from 1945, and the rest occurs in 2013. The Stinger is in 2015.
    -   _X-Men: Days of Future Past_: Goes back and fourth between 1973 and 2023. The Stinger is set _thousands_ of years ago in Ancient Egypt.
    -   _X-Men: Apocalypse_: The Distant Prologue is in Ancient Egypt 3600 BC, but the main setting is 1983.
    -   From _X-Men: The Last Stand_ to _The Wolverine_: 7 years.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   From the "Two Years Later" stinger of _The Wolverine_ to the 2023-era scenes of _X-Men: Days of Future Past_: 8 years.
    -   From _X-Men: First Class_ to the 1973 portion of _X-Men: Days of Future Past_: 11 years.
    -   From the 1973 section of _X-Men: Days of Future Past_ to _X-Men: Apocalypse_: 10 years.
    -   From _X-Men: Apocalypse_ to _Dark Phoenix_: 10 years.
-   _Youth (2017)_: The story jumps forward a few times. Among others, there's a time skip of one year after the end of the war, and after the troupe disbands, there's a skip of about 11 years to 1991.

    Literature 

-   _All The Skills - A Deckbuilding LitRPG_: After Arthur gets settled into Wolf Moon Hive, the story skips forward four years, to when he assembles his first Rare card.
-   Anne McCaffrey:
    -   _To Ride Pegasus_: skips around seventy years between the first book and its first sequel, with several main characters in the latter being children or grandchildren of characters in the former. One character who appears in both is Dorotea Horvath, who goes from being a small child to being an octogenarian grandmother.
    -   _Tower and the Hive_: There's a twenty year gap between the connected novels _Damia_ and _Damia's Children._ Damia finds out she's pregnant at the end of the former. The latter starts with that child (her eldest, Laria) about to head to another planet as a Tower Prime.
-   _Beowulf_ does it with "He ruled well / for fifty winters" and manages to have more years pass than letters are used to describe the passage of time.
-   _The Book Of The Ler_: _The Gameplayers of Zan_ is set in A.D. 2550. The second book, _Warriors of Dawn_, is set possibly millennia after. In the meantime, both the ordinary humans and their genetically engineered _ler_ offspring have colonised a large segment of the galaxy.
-   _The Black Arrow_: Book III starts some few months after Dick Shelton escapes from the hands of his guardian Sir Daniel at the end of Book II.
-   In _Brothers of the Snake_, there are huge time skips between the stories, ranging from two months to five years.
-   _The Chronicles of Narnia_: In _Prince Caspian_, the Pevensies return to Narnia to find that thousands of years have gone by there, while only one year has passed for them. Similar time skips occur throughout the series. Subverted in _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_, where the now fourteen-years-older Pevensies are chasing the white stag in the last chapter, only to be transported back to the real world as children.
-   The Tom Clancy novels, particularly between _Clear and Present Danger_ and _The Bear and the Dragon_, generally follow a pattern of pseudo-Webcomic Time, with generally around one or two years taking place between novels. Thus, a timeline which was originally set 20 Minutes into the Future began to lag behind into the past. His latest novel of the series, _Teeth of the Tiger_ rectifies this by staging an 8-10-year timeskip into the future.
-   Ian Douglass' _Heritage_, _Legacy_ and _Inheritance_ trilogies have time skips between them of century scale - the first takes place in the mid-21st century, the second in the 24th century, and the third begins at the end of the third millennium. As well, the second and third books of the Inheritance Trilogy have a timeskip of ~1000 years between them, with the third starting with the reawakening of Marines kept in stasis for centuries - but none of them are characters from the previous two books.
-   In the _Dreamblood Duology_, ten years go by between _The Killing Moon_ and _The Shadowed Sun_.
-   _The Dresden Files_ books use this on a miniature scale, generally having about a year between them, giving plenty of time for recuperation, healing, learning, and Noodle Incidents to happen. In _Ghost Story_, Harry unwittingly experiences a six-month timeskip in the course of a single conversation, apparently because it's easy to lose time when you've just been shot and killed.
-   The _Dune_ series skips _thirty-five hundred years_ between _Children_ and _God Emperor_, then another 1,500 years before _Heretics_. By comparison, the three-year skip during the first _Dune_ book (covering the early years of Paul leading the Fremen) looks like nothing.
    -   The _Legends of Dune_ series includes two trilogies separated by about 80 years with two characters (Vorian Atreides and Norma Cenva) present in all six books.
-   _Empire from the Ashes_: The third book, _Heirs of Empire_, starts a decade after the end of the previous one, and contains multiple other skips, covering over a decade itself.
-   _The Empirium Trilogy_: _Lightbringer_ includes a five year gap between the final chapter and the epilogue.
-   Several thousand years pass between _Ender's Game_ and its sequel, _Speaker for the Dead_. Though only a couple decades passed for Ender as he spent most of that time on relativistic starships.
-   Most of _Feral Creatures_, the sequel to _Hollow Kingdom_, takes place over a decade after the previous installment. While an exact time range isn't given, S.T. notes that his daughter Dee (who was a baby at the end of _Hollow Kingdom_) is now a teenager and the minor recurring feline character of Genghis Cat is mentioned to have become noticeably elderly.
-   _Forest Kingdom_: Between all the main series' books. Book 2 (_Blood and Honor_) is set seven years after book 1 (_Blue Moon Rising_), book 3 (_Down Among the Dead Men_) is set another three years later, and book 4 (_Beyond the Blue Moon_) is set twelve years after book 1, five years after the events of the end of the _Hawk & Fisher_ spinoff series, and two years after the events of book 3. Then book 5 (_Once in a Blue Moon_) is set one hundred years after the events of book 1 and eighty-eight years after the events of book 4.
-   _The Golden Demon_: Four years pass between the first and second volume, after which the protagonist changes dramatically from dutiful high school student to ruthless and renowned Loan Shark and the heroine has suffered from a disastrous marriage.
-   _Honor Harrington_: Early in the series, up to at least book 6, the novels always have a skip of at least one year between them. As the plot gets more complicated, this practice comes to an end.
-   _Hurog_: _Dragon Blood_ is set four years after _Dragon Bones_, and the protagonists are all adults, have grown more mature, and Tosten doesn't appreciate the protectiveness of his big brother Ward as much as he used to. And Ciarra is not mute anymore.
-   _The Icemark Chronicles_: Twenty years pass between book 1, _The Cry of the Icemark_, and book 2, _Blade of Fire_.
-   The first half of _I Think I Love You_ takes place in 1974 and follows the protagonist as a thirteen-year-old girl. The second half jumps ahead to 1998.
-   Lukyanenko's _Labyrinth of Reflections_ ends with Leonid meeting his Love Interest for the first time outside of VR. In _False Mirrors_, several years have passed, and they are now married. In fact, their marriage is on the rocks, especially since that first Real Life meeting at the train station never happened. It turns out Leonid dreamed it all, while suffering from Deep psychosis.
-   _Left Behind_: _Kingdom Come_ has a few time skips right in the story itself. It starts off at the beginning of the Millennium, then jumps ahead to 93 years later where it stays for most of it, then jumps again to the end of the Millennium.
-   _The Legend of Rah and the Muggles_ does it a lot, to the effect of making important things happen offscreen and Stouffer cock up basic arithmetic.
-   Sergey Lukyanenko's _Emperors of Illusions_ takes place four years after the end of _Line of Delirium_ with Tommy now having grown up (he was only 14 in the first book).
-   _The Lord of the Rings_ has a substantial time skip between the first and second chapters, to the tune of _seventeen years_ while Gandalf is off page researching the true nature of Bilbo's ring. There's also a skip of a couple of years between the penultimate and final chapters of the book.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Cory Herndon loves this trope. In both the _Mirrodin Cycle_ and the Ravnica cycle, there is a timeskip of five years between the second and third books. Also both times, the protagonist is as confused as we are, due to being in stasis in the first case and being dead in the second.
-   There's an eighteen year gap between the end of _The Miniaturist_ and the beginning of its sequel, _The House of Fortune_.
-   _Mortal Engines_ has a sixteen-year time skip between the second and third books.
-   _Gauntlgrym_, the first book of _The Neverwinter Saga_, covers nearly a _century_ during Drizzt and Bruenor's search for the titular dwarven homeland. We see only glimpses of their journey between large timeskips.
-   _The Parasol Protectorate_:
    -   There's an implied skip of a few months at the end of _Soulless_ between the events of the book proper and the wedding in the epilogue.
    -   _Changeless_ takes place three months after said wedding.
    -   Book 4, _Heartless_, takes place five months after the events of book 3, at the end of Alexia's pregnancy.
    -   _Timeless_, the fifth and final book, takes place two years after _Heartless_.
-   _Perry Rhodan_ regularly features Time Skips between arcs varying in length from a few years to a few centuries. The longer Time Skips have the nice side effect of whittling the cast down to more managable levels with everyone who was not immortal, a member of a particularly long lived race, a robot or AI, frozen in stasis or a godlike or ascended higher being having died of old age in the interim.
-   _The Pillars of the Earth_: Time skips happen between every part. The whole story is set in about forty years of time (or about fifty if one counts the prologue), which is not surprising considering the novel is about building a cathedral.
-   Beatrix Potter created two books featuring Peter Rabbit and later Benjamin Bunny and even one of his sisters as adults in the book _The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies_ and _The Tale of Mr Tod_.
-   _The Power of Five_: The beginning of _Oblivion_ features a 10-year time skip from _Necropolis_.
-   _The Princess Bride_: Used very pointedly. Because William Goldman claims to be "abridging" the original novel, he often cuts out chunks of what he claims are very boring pieces of narrative. The timeskip comes when Buttercup, having agreed to marry Prince Humperdinck, must go through a few years of royalty schooling in order to become a princess. Goldman says this is terribly dull and so he boils it down to simply this: "What with one thing and another, three years passed."
-   _Quantum Gravity_: There's a time skip where we come back to find that Lila has spent a lot of time in Demonia and married Zal and _Teazle_, of all people. There's another one which takes the trope literally, as Lila is catapulted forward fifty years.
-   _Retired Witches Mysteries_: Book 2 picks up six months after book 1 ended.
-   _Rip Van Winkle_, probably the most famous example, has a man drinking enchanted liquor and falling alseep in the Caskills, then waking up twenty years later, having missed The American Revolution.
-   _Sano Ichiro_: There is a five-year gap between the last two books of the series, _The Shogun's Daughter_ and _The Iris Fan_, though there are flashbacks of the interim period in the latter. Circumstances have changed greatly for Sano and those around him, and definitely not for the better.
-   _Schismatrix_ skips more and more time the longer it goes. The first four chapters all take place over the course of around 19 months, while the last two chapters alone contain skips of 53 and 32 years. Also, in universe, there is a group that practices "ice assassination", by forcing people to experience a time skip through cryogenics.
-   _The Shadowhunter Chronicles_:
    -   _The Dark Artifices_ is set five years after _The Mortal Instruments_. Emma, Julian, Livia, and Tiberius are now teens instead of tweens, Dru is a tween instead of a kid, and Octavian is a kid instead of a baby. Clary and her friends (barring Magnus) have also aged up to their twenties.
    -   _The Last Hours_ is set 25 years after _The Infernal Devices_. The former teenage/young adult characters are now middle-aged adults in the London Enclave and have children of their own, who are the main characters. Except for Tessa, of course, but her young looks are never a hindrance, and she is generally treated as a senior in the community.
-   _Shtum_: The last chapter takes place at the end of Jonah's first year at his new school, with Ben looking forward to Jonah's first fortnight-long stay at home and visiting Jonatan's grave in Bulgaria.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: George R. R. Martin originally intended to utilize a five-year time skip after _A Storm of Swords_. More than six months of labor later, Martin figured out it wouldn't work and had to start over. As of _A Dance with Dragons_, the series is still stuck in 300 AC, the year the events of _A Storm of Swords_ conclude in.
-   _The Space Odyssey Series_ has books titled _2001_, _2010_, _2061_, and _3001_. No points for guessing the length of the time skips. It's notable that a Human Popsicle from the first book plays a large role in the last one.
-   _Star Carrier_ jumps twenty years between book three, _Singularity_, and book four, _Deep Space_. Then-Admiral Koenig has been elected first to the USNA Senate, then to the presidency, and then-Lieutenant Gray is now a captain and commanding officer of the _America_.
-   _Star Trek: New Frontier_ has the three-year timeskip between _Stone and Anvil_ and _After the Fall_, during which time various characters have been promoted, changed allegiances, married, and, in some cases, previously implacable near-enemies have apparently become friends. Oh, and there was a major war (which was precipitated by the heroes in the novel before the jump).
-   _Star Wars Legends_:
    -   _Death Star_: There are multiple skips of several months. They never get announced; it's always through dialogue or the narration.
    -   _Galaxy of Fear_: _Death in the Slave Pits of Lorrd, or What I Did on My Inter-Term Break_, is an Interquel written over a decade after the main series came out, addressing the several things skipped over in that series' gap between _Army of Terror_ and _The Brain Spiders_.
    -   _Jedi Apprentice_: There's a timeskip of unknown length between _The Day of Reckoning_ and _The Fight for Truth_, in which Obi-Wan relaxes into his Jedi role a little farther and strengthens his bond with Qui-Gon.
-   _The Sword Of Saint Ferdinand_: The novel's Second Part starts about six years after the end of the previous half.
-   _Taiko_ skips over decades at a time, with the story beginning in 1536 and ending in 1583.
-   _The Tale of Genji_: The Uji chapters skip forward about twenty-five years and are about Genji's son and his peers (as the opening chapter says right off, Genji's dead). Since the Tale is often considered the first Novel (or at least the first psychological novel), it just goes to show.

-   The second book of the _Tough Magic_ trilogy, _Trenus_, skips about a month's worth of time from the first book.
-   _Under Suspicion_ frequently utilises time skips both in individual installments and between books, especially as the plots revolve around investigating cold cases.
    -   _I've Got You Under My Skin_: The prologue takes place five years before the main events of the book, while the epilogue takes place six months after the climax.
    -   _The Cinderella Murder_: The first three chapters take place on May 7th and May 8th 1994, introducing the reader to the Dempsey family and leading up to Susan Dempsey's murder from the perspective of her mother. It then skips ahead twenty years to the main part of the story in 2014. The epilogue is set two months after the story's climax. It's also set nearly a year after the events of _I've Got You Under My Skin_.
    -   _All Dressed in White_: The prologue is set just over five years before the main events of the story, introducing us to Amanda forty-three hours before her ill-fated wedding was to take place; the epilogue takes place a month after the main story is wrapped up. It begins two months after the epilogue of _The Cinderella Murder_.
    -   _The Sleeping Beauty Killer_: The prologue takes place on the day Casey learns her verdict in the murder trial; the story then picks up fifteen years later on the day Casey comes out of prison. The main story begins a month after the epilogue of _All Dressed in White_.
    -   The prologue of _Every Breath You Take_ is set three years before the main events of the story, during the Met gala where Virginia Wakeling dies. The main story Is set nearly three months after _The Sleeping Beauty Killer_.
    -   _You Don't Own Me_ is set a few months after the previous novel. The prologue takes place on the night of Martin Bell's murder, then skips ahead five years to the present day events. The final chapter takes place two weeks after the main story is concluded.
-   _Venus Prime_ features several time skips to cover the times that Sparta and Blake spend either in extended transit or establishing cover identities (the first book, for instance, has a two-year time skip to cover Sparta working her way through the Space Board bureaucracy, and then a six-month time skip to cover her training to become an Investigator.)
-   The _Vita Nuova_ begins with a brief prose section about Beatrice and Dante's first meeting in 1274 before segueing into Dante's poetry about her written from 1283 to 1293. The poet explains that he didn't want to go much into his youth since stories about kids often sound made-up.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: In _Talon of Horus_, there's a two month's time skip as _Tlaloc_ travels across the Eye to the nearest safe harbor, and then another few months as it makes its way towards the edge of the Negative Space Wedgie the book takes place in.
-   _Warrior Cats_: There is a 12-month skip between the first and second series (although this gap has been filled by _Firestar's Quest_ and _Ravenpaw's Path_), and a six month gap between the second and third series. The fourth series is also supposed to start around six months after the end of the third.
-   Seventeen years pass between _Whence Comes A Prince_ and the next book, _Grace In Thine Eyes_, of the _Lowlands of Scotland_ series by Liz Curtis Higgs.
-   Gregory Maguire's _The Wicked Years_ series features multiple time-skips. Book One alone has _four_, jumping from Elphaba's birth and infancy straight to Elphaba's time at university, through to the university crowd in their mid-to-late twenties, and finally to Elphaba in her mid-thirties. Book Two (_Son of a Witch_) starts out with Liir still a child only a little older than he was in _Wicked_, but quickly skips to his early-to-mid twenties. Book Three (_A Lion Among Men_) focuses on a different set of characters and actually goes back and forth compared to the main continuity, but has a lot of internal skips of its own as Brrr's life story is told in disjointed order from birth to middle-age. Finally, Book Four (_Out of Oz_) skips again to Rain (born at the end of Book Two) as a child of seven or so, and proceeds to follow her more or less continuously until the age of sixteen.
-   _The Witch of Knightcharm_: After the end of the orientation arc, the next episode takes place a month later, after the surviving students have recovered somewhat and gotten acclimated to the evil Wizarding School that they're stuck in.
-   Stephen Baxter's _Xeelee Sequence_ has many time skips. The book _Exultant_ hops back and forth between the first few nanoseconds of the universe and 28,000 years into our future, while _Ring_ starts in the year AD 3951 and jumps to AD 5,000,000.
-   C.T. Phipps' _Agent G_ series has a fifteen year time skip after _Saboteur_ that follows the release of Black Technology into the world and the transformation of society from the _present_ to a Gibosnian Cyberpunk dystopia.
-   _Wolf Pack_: After the prologue ends with Garrett and Phyllis discovering the wolf pups they've taken in have turned into human babies, the book jumps ahead 15 years to when said babies are teenagers.
-   _Worm_ has a two-year timeskip following the death of Behemoth, during which Taylor trains with the Chicago Wards, fights more Endbringers and Class-S threats than are covered in the story previously, and becomes a respected superhero, with the timeskip concluding on the eve of Taylor being admitted into the Protectorate and reuniting with the Undersiders. The skip encompasses _eight times_ as much time as the entire million+ word story preceeding it.

    Music 

-   _Kids Praise_: Apparently at least a few years were between the second an third albums, given that Psalty both got married and had triplets who had become more than old enough to speak in the intervening time. The third album begins with the kids decorating a barn for a welcome back party for Psalty.
-   C. W. McCall: "Jackson Hole" describes the people who worked in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in different eras, and jumps forward to new eras with every verse, starting in 1836, jumping a hundred years forward to 1836 and then forty years forward to 1976.

    Myths & Religion 

-   _The Bible_:
    -   In the _Book of Exodus_, there's a time skip in Chapter 2 from Moses as an infant to Moses as a 40-year-old Egyptian prince who sees a fellow Isralite in trouble, defends him from his attacker, and flees to the Midian desert in fear of being found out. Then at the beginning of Chapter 3, it skips to Moses being around 80 years old when God calls him to Himself through the burning bush.
    -   _The Four Gospels_: In the gospel of Matthew, there's at least a two-year skip between when Joseph is told that Mary is having a child by the Holy Spirit and when the three Wise Men pay the young Jesus a visit, then after that there's a skip to when Jesus is about thirty years old and is baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan. In the gospel of Luke, there's a twelve-year skip between Jesus' infancy and His being in the Temple in Jerusalem as a young boy, then it skips again to His baptism in the Jordan.
-   _The Odyssey_ is a sequel to _The Iliad_ and starts about one year later. It then lasts ten years, with time skips from one to seven years in the middle.

    Podcasts 

-   Across several _Cool Kids Table_ games:
    -   The first round of _Creepy Town_ takes place a week before Halloween as the victims set up the Creepy Town haunted house, and the next one is the night before Halloween while they do a dry run.
    -   The four children in the _Harry Potter_\-themed game _Hogwarts: The New Class_ are taken to Hogwarts in the spring, but spend a montage in the summer learning about the wizarding world so that they're not out of their depth when they start classes in the fall.
    -   _Sequinox_ has one between each pair of episodes during which the team fights low-level mooks, while the episodes themselves focus on bigger battles with stars and constellations.
-   The last two episodes of _1865_ skip ahead to 1867 and 1868 to cover the impeachment of Andrew Johnson.

    Roleplay 

-   The PBP board _Cerberus Daily News_' went forward one in-universe year after the conclusion of Mass Effect 3.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _BattleTech_ had a number of timeskips:
    -   The 20 Year Update made the jump from 3028, just after the 4th Succession War, to 3049, right before the Clan Invasion. The War of 3039 was presented as backstory.
    -   A much longer timeskip happened with the launch of _Mechwarrior: Dark Age_. It is set in the same timeline as _BattleTech_, just in 3132 instead of 3067 (where _BattleTech_ was at the time). Because of that, it presented the major Word of Blake Jihad, started in 3067, entirely as backstory to the Dark Age era. This also massively spoiled most of the major events of the Jihad era. Combined with the radical changes to the game's rules, moving to a CCG\-style rather than _BattleTech_'s standard board-game, fans were not pleased. The _Dark Age_ boardgame was later discontinued (though not due to lack of success; despite persistent rumors to the contrary, _Dark Age_ and its sequel _Age of Destruction_ were actually very popular), and the main boardgame and timeline has since caught up to it.
-   _Exalted_ has rules for instituting your own time skips, with recommended amounts of Experience Points earned by your characters during the skip as it's assumed they didn't spend the whole time sitting around doing nothing. These can range from months to decades, and can be necessary if you want your characters to get all the training time they need once they get into high Essence ranges (5+), or to make magical artifacts, or various other projects.
-   More than a few tabletop Role-Playing Games and settings put time skips between editions (if they don't just change the setting entirely):
    -   _Forgotten Realms_ has jumped years to centuries with changes in _Dungeons & Dragons_, and _Greyhawk_ has undergone some changes as well (when it still got support, anyway).
    -   _Shadowrun_ tends to change to keep the current edition about 60 years ahead of the real-world date when it's published, advancing the cutting edge of cyberware and other tech (and because Technology Marches On).
    -   _Magic: The Gathering_ has had jumps of months, years, or centuries between blocks as the story moves along or shifts to a different plane entirely. Between _Antiquities_ (the Brothers' War) and _Odyssey_/_Onslaught_ (some of the last blocks to take place directly on Dominaria) the game covered around 2000 years of Dominarian history. The _Urza's Saga_ block in particular followed Urza's millennia of plotting and planning from the very end of the Brothers' War to just before the Phyrexian invasion.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_ With the introduction of the Horus Heresy series, there is technically a time skip from the heresy to "present day", 10k years later. While the Horus Heresy game is built upon the same game system as "regular 40k", its points system does not seem to be balanced against the existing 40k system (with many saying that it has good internal balance, but will utterly crush any current 40k army). Forge World (the producer of Horus Heresy series) differentiate between the two by stating that certain models can be used in 40k, dubbed the "Age of Darkness", and gain extra rules to reflect how they're older technology, but also has adjusted point costs and rules. The Horus Heresy campaign books itself contains several time skips within the Heresy, as it took place across several years with only a few notable events happening (due to it being an intergalactic war). Between 7th and 8th editions there's a jump from the final days of the 41st millennium to a little more than a century later... or the next day, depending on where a given character was standing when time went weird.
-   _Warhammer: Age of Sigmar_: Between first and second editions; after the conclusion of the "Realmgate Wars" — the game's first narrative campaign series — there's a forward jump of about a century, which allowed for the introduction of the Cities of Sigmar as both a new faction and as main settings for a lot of the story going forward; they were built in the interim after the Realmgate Wars allowed Sigmar to establish beachheads in each Mortal Realm.

    Theatre 

-   At the end of the first act of _Aspects of Love_, Rose has written Alex a letter saying that she is pregnant with her daughter, Jenny. When the second act starts, Jenny is 12 years old, and she jumps to 15 later on.
-   A hundred years pass between the acts of _Sunday in the Park with George_.
-   Sixteen years pass between the third and fourth acts of William Shakespeare's _The Winter's Tale_, following his most famous stage direction, "Exit, pursued by a bear". The time skips are Lampshaded in the Prologue of _Henry V_:
    
    'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings / Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times / Turning the accomplishments of many years / Into an hourglass
    
-   In between the first two acts of _Our Town_, three years pass, and, between the second and third act, 9 years and the deaths of several characters, including Emily go by.
-   The second act of _Show Boat_ opens with the World's Fair of 1893, but with the change of scene skips a decade to see Magnolia and Ravenal's marriage unravel. From ringing in the new year of 1905, it abruptly jumps past World War I to 1927.
-   _Vanities_ does this at least twice (three times in The Musical). The first act/scene is in 1963, the second in 1968, the third in 1974, and the musical's finale is sometime in the mid 80's-early 90's.
-   _The Pitmen Painters_ goes through multiple timeskips, starting in 1934 and ending in 1948.
-   _Miss Saigon_ has a scene end with Kim and Chris embracing on the balcony of their apartment. The next scene is celebrating three years since the reunification of Vietnam.
-   _Prima Facie_: The second half of the story takes place 782 days after Tessa's rape, represented by numbers projected on the wall ticking progressively upwards. It makes a point about how long victims must wait for their cases to be heard in court.
-   In _The Rose Tattoo_, the first three scenes form a sort of prologue to the rest of the drama, which takes place three years later.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   Seven years pass between the end of _Trials and Tribulations_ and the beginning of _Apollo Justice_.
    -   There are minor time skips of only one year between the first three games of the series, as well as between the second three games.
    -   Downplayed with the _Ace Attorney Investigations_ duology. The second game picks up only ten days after the first one.
    -   In _The Great Ace Attorney_, about six months pass between the first and second games.
-   In _Strawberry Vinegar_, you will get a time skip to nine years later after the credits, with the exception of one bad ending.
-   In the True Ending of ClockUp's _Euphoria_, the final scenes take place three years after the main events have ended.
-   _An Octave Higher_ has varying time skips of several months for three of its five possible endings. The true story path begins with a five-year time skip after the end of the first act.
-   _Sunrider 4: The Captain's Return_ takes place six years after the disastrous ending of the previous game, _Sunrider: Liberation Day_.

    Web Animation 

-   _A Day With Bowser Jr_: This fanmade Mario series takes place in the near future, where Bowser Jr is in his teens.
-   _gen:LOCK_ opens in 2068 with the Union's attack on New York City, and then skipping ahead four years to 2072. Season 2 also picks up six months after the season 1 finale.
-   Some time happens between _Inanimate Insanity_ and _Inanimate Insanity II_, which is long enough for OJ to create a hotel with the money he won.
-   Volume 3 of _RWBY_ ends with the transition from Fall to Winter, during which Ruby fully recovers from her injuries and leaves for Haven with the remaining members of Team JNPR. Volume 4 starts 6 to 8 months after Volume 3.
-   In _Welcome to... Facebook!_, the titular guide is deactivated by its user a minute into the video, and it reawakens four months later, horrified to see what said user has done to her profile.
-   _CPU Championship Series_: Season 4 is set 2 years after Season 3, with the first tournament even being called TIMESKIP.
-   The second season of _Meta Runner_ takes place six months after the finale of the first. The third season had a much less drastic jump of a week.
-   _Lackadaisy_, the Animated Adaptation of the webcomic of the same name, is actually a Stealth Sequel, set a mere three-and-a-half months in the comic's future. The comic begins in earnest around May 21st, 1927. Its most recent strips have Venturous Smugglers Rocky, Freckle and Ivy making their debut as a whiskey-runners for a probationary supplier, while speakeasy saxophonist Zib and Professional Killer Mordecai concurrently realize through a police station encounter and mob informant grapevine that the feds are newly arrived in town. An open day planner on a station desk places these events no later than _May 31st of that year._ The Pilot Movie takes place in mid-September 1927, as referenced by speakeasy owner Mitzi May reading, out loud, a passage from Isadora Duncan's obituary. (Her real-life scarf-induced tragicomic death occurred September 14, 1927.) By then, Rocky and company are a slightly less green Caper Crew, the supplier is now a regular, underworld figures treat the Feds presence as common knowledge, and Zib, booked for public drunkeness and in jail for a two-month stint in-comic, is out amongst 'em and soused as ever.
-   ‘’Wolf Song: The Movie’’ has a few. The opening scene is Cerberus instructing his younger brother to find him 3 items needed for him to escape, it then immediately cuts to some time later where said brother of Cerberus reveals he is actually the Big Bad and conducts a brutal massacre of two different packs, with Koda, a juvenile survivor of the massacre vowing revenge on the guy that killed those he knew. The film then cuts to a snowstorm several months or years later where the rest of the plot kicks off.

    Webcomics 

-   _Cashmere Sky_: After the events of Volume One, Volume Two skips forward in time by seven years.
-   _Tower of God_ has a five year time skip between season 1 and season 2. The changes are rather great: the main character is definitely not who he used to be, he is about to meet new comrades, the setting went from the second floor<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  to the 20th and the tone is a bit more shounen-like, at least at first. Most of the important cast and Paracule are reintroduced later.
-   _The Order of the Stick_ had a time skip come out of the blue when we follow Roy, dead and in Heaven, in his reunification with his late parents. We actually see what transpires for him, but he finds out the hard way that he's been dead for three and a half months — he failed to notice the passage of time because in the afterlife the sun never sets, the weather never changes, and he never gets hungry or thirsty or tired. We then cut back to the other characters and catch up on their (rather grim) situation.
-   At first, _Dominic Deegan_ had each adventure following on the heels of the last. Lately, after every arc the comic skips forward a few months.
-   _Questionable Content_ is known for having a very sporadic case of _Webcomic Time_, where a single week's worth of strips can depict anything from a week's passage in-universe to a single one-minute long conversation. However, around comic 1311, a time-skip long enough for it to become winter and for Dora's hair to grow out, exposing her blonde roots, occurred. Judging by the length of her hair, Penelope's pining over Wil's absence, and the seasonal change, at least two or three months passed between one strip and the next.
    -   At strip 4846, Clinton states it's been months since the events of the previous arc. He didn't say how many in that strip.
-   _Coga Suro_ has an eighteen-year time skip between 'Coga Suro' and 'Coga Suro 2' \[imaginatively named sequel\].
-   _Arthur, King of Time and Space_:
    -   The webcomic had a timeskip after Merlin's death in the contemporary arc and the sabbatical. Although the sabbatical only lasted six months, the strip picks up again two years later, when present-day Guenevere is expecting her second child, and Merlin is about to get imprisoned forever by Nimue in the base arc/leave with his new apprentice Nimue in the space arc. It's since been established that previous cartoons have been pushed backwards so it's still "the present" in the contemporary arc, meaning Merlin didn't become an advisor to Obama, because he was dead before the election.
    -   A second sixth-month sabbatical took us forward 10 years, from Mark killing Tristram and Isolde, and the death of the False Guenevere/Fasha, in all the arcs to Contemporary Arthur announcing he was standing for the presidency.
-   _Darths & Droids_ has a two-year time skip in the "real world" at the same time as a ten-year time skip in the roleplaying game the characters are playing, between _The Phantom Menace_ and _Attack of the Clones_. And then another two "real" years, along with the three in-universe years, pass between _Attack of the Clones_ and _Revenge of the Sith_. This two-year skip trend continues with the subsequent movies, aside from _Rogue One_ and _Solo_ each being a Whole Episode Flashback recounted during other events.
    -   Lampshaded with the _The Last Jedi_ campaign, where Pete complains about having to wait two whole years to resolve the Wham Line from the end of the last campaign, given that in-universe no time has passed.
-   _Rumors of War_ features a two-month time skip between the first and second Story Arcs. In the first arc, the characters are en route to the city of Varna and encounter adventure during a layover, while in the beginning of the second arc they are implied to have not only reached their destination, but to have been there for some time. In the meantime, several characters have vanished and several new ones have appeared, owing to the comic's large cast.
-   Not too long after the reset _Fuzzy Things_ skipped forward two years, so that the main cast are eight instead of six years old.
-   _The Last Days of Foxhound_ skips seven months after FOXHOUND allies themselves against the Patriots, but other than that they seem to skip indeterminate amounts of time between major story arcs and even simple conversations within an arc.
-   The initial storyline of _Collar 6_ involves a spanking contest that's three weeks off, and the first year of story only covered a single day, so it was inevitable that they'd use a Training Montage.
-   _All Roses Have Thorns_ started off during the early 16th century, it is currently now in the 19th century, with various skips forward in time in between.
-   _Homestuck_. The story for the first five Acts takes place over a single day, disregarding Flashbacks and characters in the far future. Act 6 takes place about three years after that day...in an Alternate Universe. As the characters from the original universe travel to the new one (a trip which takes three years), the story of their journey is told through a series of vignettes in the Act 6 Intermissions, stopping at the beginning of the journey, 1 year into it, 2 years into it, and the end of the journey.
    -   During Act 4, there is a four-month time skip into a Bad Future where John has died fighting his Denizen way too early, and Jade could not enter the Medium and died too. It gets reverted though.
    -   After the alpha kids enter the medium, we see flashes of what they go through as we skip ahead 22 weeks.
-   _8-Bit Theater_ had a time skip relatively early on... Which was accidentally undone by "The Wizard Who Did It", while he was making dinner, before we really had a chance to see _anything_.
-   _Dumbing of Age_:
    -   Book 2 technically had one, which is a relief considering that it had been a year and the characters had barely finished the first few weeks of school. The problem? The time skip was _four days._
    -   Book 6 had another one, again lasting all of four days.
    -   Book 7 jumps forward _three_ days to skip the aftermath of Ryan attacking Amber with a knife...and getting the shit kicked out of him.
    -   Book 10 commemorates the comic's first decade by being the biggest Wham Episode thus far, and ends with a time jump of several _months_, with multiple strips forming a Time Passes Montage.
-   _Magician_ has an approximate 8 year time skip after part one where The Bad Guy Wins.
-   _El Goonish Shive_ skipped ahead six months in one panel, which is rather impressive considering that the entire ten-year long run of the comic had only encompassed about 5 months (not including brief flashbacks), starting on January 25th. The skip runs from June 30th to December 23rd.
-   _Drowtales_ had several.
    -   The first occurred in Chapter 1, where there was a 10-year jump.
    -   The next happened during Chapter 2, where there was a 4- or 5-year jump.
    -   The most significant storywise is a 15-year jump between Chapters 32 and 33.
    -   A three-year timeskip occurs between chapters 51 and 52.
-   Not an in-universe one, but a sketch page for _Forever 16_ has the main cast appear as 21-year-olds.
-   Ryan Armand used a time skip for a narrative purpose in his webcomic _Great_ After all sorts of wacky and over-the-top situations both before and after it, the protagonist is still not satisfied with his life despite spending the whole comic pursuing greatness — as it turns out, it is rather heavily implied that the best time of his life was when he was quietly living normally with his wife and kid, for a period of six years that was skipped over for his son to grow up, and that the readers don't get to see much of once the plot restarts.
-   _Girl Genius_ has protagonist Agatha (and the audience with her) go through one in-universe when she gets unwillingly dragged through a magical teleportation-portal. Thanks to outside events, the normally instantaneous trip takes two and a half years, during which things have gone pretty badly for all the rest of Europa.
-   In _Imaginatives_, after Kordon takes over at the end of _13 Stories of Hell_, there’s a ten year gap before the beginning of the _Dystopian Utopia_ arc.
-   _Plume_ jumps several months between chapter 9 and 10 as characters get used to their new situations, such as Corrick now accompanying Dom and Vesper and Tegan searching for them. It also gives Hunter time to track Vesper down.
-   _Cobweb and Stripes_ begins two years after the events of the film _Beetlejuice_, and contains a number of time skips within the story itself. For instance, chapter 14 takes place entirely on one day in July (Lydia's birthday); chapter 15 then jumps a few weeks into the future to late August, when she leaves to start college.
-   _Zebra Girl_: While Sandra was banished to the Subfusc for a few days top, time on Earth flew much more quickly. As such, exactly 1,666 days went by between her banishment and her comeback. Even Sam, who was skeptical about Sandra's return, is forced to admit that this is ominous enough.
-   _Table Titans_ has one between season 1 and 2. Of the original party consisting of Drake the cleric, Lulani the bard, Lefleur the thief and Draziw the wizard (and their pet blink dog), only Draziw and Lefleur remain, the fate of the others being unknown. At some point the remaining two also befriended the paladin Gar, the barbarian Valeria and the ranger Arroc. Draziw has also graduated from magic school, and has grown a beard.
-   _ReBoot: Code of Honor_ picks up "hours" after the end of _ReBoot_'s cliffhanger ending, with Mainframe being completely devasted and overrun by Megabyte's zombinomes.
-   In _Yokoka's Quest_, between each chapter is a time skip of a few weeks or months. The durations aren't explicitly stated, but can be inferred as lasting longer than just a few days from hair growing longer, learning to speak a new language, becoming adept at swordfighting, etc. Less than a year has passed in total between chapter 3 and chapter 9.
-   In _Crimson Knights_ two years pass between chapters 3 and 4. There are also several smaller ones between other chapters.
-   Not a huge one, but in _Ennui GO!_, at least two months have passed between Izzy's wedding in Part 1 to Max and co. starting high school in Part 2.

-   Happens twice in _Greek Ninja_ during the journey to and from Japan.
-   _Tech Infantry_ is mostly organized into seasons in conscious imitation of Myth Arc\-laden series such as Babylon 5, with a few shorter stories considered "TV Movies". The first two seasons take place a hundred years after a prequel movie, then time skips 20 years for third season, several decades more for the fourth season, then the fifth through seventh seasons are set several centuries later, then eighth season jumps back to an alternate timeline 20 years after the fourth season, then there's the Aborted Arc _Tech Infantry: Exodus_ spin-off project, set several centuries after the seventh season.
-   _Chaos Fighters II_ is set 100 years after _Chaos Fighters_ and _Chaos Fighters: Chemical Warriors_.
-   The second book of _Tales of MU_ starts at the beginning of Mack's second year at MU, truncating the ending of her first semester.
-   _Can You Spare a Quarter?_: The epilogue plays out eight years after the rest of the story, and it is the moment when Jamie - who is now an adult - finally breaks with the last vestiges of his past.

    Web Videos 

-   Asrika Films: The third act of _SpongeBob SquarePants_ Gag Dub "Tragedy in Mie Ayam Shop" uses clips from "Krusty Towers" and takes place three weeks after the part adapted from "Squid on Strike". In the video's context, the time skip fills the time needed for Mr. Krabs to renovate his _mie ayam_ shop after SpongeBob destroys it.
-   In _Noob_ this is implied by the level progression of the characters between two seasons. These gaps are loosely filled by the novels and comics.
-   _Video Game High School_: There's a timeskip after Brian leaves school. He gets a job at an arcade, takes over the arcade, becomes a respected businessman, well-loved by both his customers and coworkers... all in the space of _one day_.
    
    **Brian:** Ted? How long has it been? Twenty? Twenty-four hours?  
    **Ted:** You haven't aged a day!
    
-   _Critical Role_ has a few:
    -   The first is between Episodes 94 and 95, during which the members of Vox Machina pursue their own personal projects over the course of a year.
    -   The second is a twenty-year period between the end of the Vox Machina campaign and the beginning of the second campaign.
    -   The third is the mini campaign Exandria Unlimited take place six year after Campaign Two
    -   The fourth with Campaign Three, which happens 1 year after Exandria Unlimited.
-   _Out With Dad_: After season three, the series jumps ahead, with Rose going from being fifteen to beginning university.

    Western Animation 

-   _Arcane_: After the very first scene shows Vi and Powder as young children, the rest of Act 1 skips forward to Vi as a teenager and Powder still a kid. Act 2 jumps forward again, with Vi as a young adult and Jinx as a teenager.
-   Disney at one point was going to make an animated series based on _The Aristocats_ which turned Duchess's kittens Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz into teenagers. The idea got cancelled in 2006, but concept art of the characters do exist.
-   The _Ben 10_ franchise did this with every entry of the "classic continuity". The biggest was the five-year Time Skip between the original series and _Alien Force_ that was largely used to make the series Darker and Edgier. _Ultimate Alien_ takes place a year after _Alien Force_, while _Omniverse_ takes place a few months after _Ultimate Alien_, with aliens now living among humans generally peacefully; the series even takes advantage of the initial five-year Time Skip to have a fair number of interquel stories.
-   _Beware the Batman_ has a six-month time skip between "Reckoning" and "Nexus". This was done to allow Gotham City to heal after the black-out and mayhem created by Ra's al Ghul and to show the harmful effects that Alfred's departure from Bruce and Tatsu has caused on the former.
-   "The Adventure Begins", the two-part premiere episode of the 2006 revival of _Biker Mice from Mars_, establishes that ten years have passed since the events of the original 1993 series.
-   The first episode of _Castlevania_ begins in 1455 with Lisa coming to Dracula's castle to become a doctor and Dracula's wife. The episode then skips twenty years ahead to 1475 and shows Lisa's execution as a witch. It then skips ahead another year to 1476, which is then used as the show's "present".
-   Two years pass between the second _ChalkZone_ short on _Oh Yeah! Cartoons_ ("The Amazin' River", which would later be edited into the series episode "French Fry Falls"), which was the last one to air during the show's first season in 1998, and the third short ("Rudy's Date") which began the next season of _Oh Yeah! Cartoons_. This was brought upon by Nickelodeon; when production began on the shorts for the second season, Nick was interested into giving it its' own show. However, they requested that Rudy had to be a little older (he was eight at first and ten after the time skip).
-   _Darkwing Duck_. No less than 3 years pass between the pilot and episode 17, where Gosalyn remarks Darkwing turns into a camping maniac every spring (at least 2 of them would be needed for it to be a pattern), and that it's spring again. The implication is that all this happened right after the pilot, as Darkwing transformed from a totally inept nobody to one of the most respected superheroes on the planet, called in for help by the world police on a number of occasions. And between the end of the TV series and the comic by Boom! Kids, a year and a half has gone by.
-   _DC Animated Universe_:
    -   _Batman: The Animated Series_ had a follow-up called _The New Batman Adventures_, which took place a few years later and showed some changes in the characters (Tim Drake was Robin, Dick Grayson was Nightwing, and Barbara Gordon was much more active as Batgirl). Somewhat later (after the end of _Justice League_), according to Word of God, the Joker kidnapped Robin after Darkseid and Lex disappeared.
    -   _Justice League Unlimited_ takes place about a year after _Justice League_, after the League has built a new Watchtower and recruited a much larger membership.
    -   _Justice League_ itself takes place a few years after _Superman: The Animated Series_. It's not specified how many years exactly, but it's at least enough time for Superman's public image to have recovered somewhat after the events of the latter's Grand Finale “Legacy” and for a few more heroes to have established themselves.
    -   _Batman Beyond_ begins with Bruce Wayne's final battle as Batman, about twenty years after the previously-mentioned _DC Animated Universe_ series. The series proper takes place twenty years after that (about 40 years from the rest of the _DCAU_).
-   Nickelodeon announced their intentions to launch a teenage _Dora the Explorer_ series, where the main plots will often involve Dora going shopping at the mall and hanging out with the boys at school, maintaining her educational values from the original series by solving mysteries, and sport a slightly older character design. Interestingly, Nickelodeon did not intend to show off imagery of the new Dora until the fall toyline, releasing only a teaser silhouette of her. Some parents and children liked it, though some were worried about how much chickification Dora's about to go through. Nickelodeon properly unveiled her in attempt to settle the outcry. In the end, the ensuing series, _Dora and Friends: Into the City!_ lasted only 38 episodes and killed the series for a while.
-   _A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!_, the Live-Action Adaptation and Series Fauxnale of _The Fairly Oddparents_ is set 13 years after the series and Retcons the ending of _Channel Chasers_.
-   The Season 2 finale of _Generator Rex_ sends Rex forward six months into the future, with the status quo being affected by his absence during that time.
-   _The Legend of Korra_ takes place 70 years after _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ ended. Long enough that there are few surviving characters from the original series and the children of said characters are middle-aged adults. _Korra_ itself has a six-month time skip between Books 1 and 2. Then a three-year skip between Books 3 and 4.
-   _Looney Tunes_:
    -   _The Old Grey Hare_: Bugs and Elmer are shown in then distant year of 2000, where they are both old.
-   _Moral Orel_ does two timeskips in the second to last episode. It time skips from the Spring Season foward Six months to the fall season, then at the end of that episode it skips to Christmas.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ has its Dénouement Episode, "The Last Problem", take place an unspecificed number of years after the preceeding two-parter episode. It's implied to be at least a couple of decades though, as characters who were children and infants during the show's run are now adults, while Luster Dawn remarks that the era before Twilight ascended the throne was "so long ago."
-   _OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes_: Parodied in the season two premiere "Seasons Change", when K.O. comes back from a three-month Time Skip between seasons one and two to find a bunch of silly, nonsensical changes that have happened over the summer, like Enid becoming a mime, Rad turning orange, and background characters getting random redesigns. He’s not impressed. Even funnier, the few actually plot relevant changes like Darrell taking over Boxmore or Mr. Gar dating K.O.’s mom are shunted off to the background while the team obsesses over irrelevant things that get undone by the end of the episode.
-   _The Owl House_: At the end of season 2, the Hex Squad are stranded on Earth. Season 3 starts from there and soon skips to several months later, with a Time Passes Montage showing Luz's friends adjusting to life in the Human Realm and a few failed attempts at finding a way back to the Demon Realm.
    -   The epilogue takes place several years after the final battle, with the cast about to celebrate Luz's 18th birthday.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_: The episode "Act Your Age" takes place ten years in the future.
-   _Quack Pack_ was an animated series that aired which featured Huey, Dewey and Louie as teenagers.
-   _ReBoot_ combined a time skip with Year Inside, Hour Outside. During the third season, Enzo and AndrAIa found themselves trapped in the Game after losing it, moving from system to system. After their initial loss, the series time-skipped to Enzo and AndrAIa as adults, with significant but much less time having passed back on Mainframe.
-   A one-year time skip occurs in the _Road Rovers_ episodes "Dawn of the Groomer" and "Still a Few Bugs in the System".
-   _Rugrats_ Sequel Series _All Grown Up!_ follows the baby characters from the first series after a ten-year time skip, inspired by the show's tenth-anniversary special: a What If? episode that showed what it might be like if _Rugrats_ hadn't been Frozen in Time the length of its run. Despite popular belief, it actually wasn't intended to serve as a Poorly Disguised Pilot: the producers were far more interested in different spin-off ideas that would have mostly maintained the ages of the characters, such as a show about Angelica and Suzie starting preschool. However, the ratings for the special were so good (at 11.9 million viewers, the TV movie is the most-watched program in the channel's history by a wide margin) that Nick naturally wanted a spin-off of that instead. For its part, the preschool show (_Rugrats Pre School Daze_) would have four direct-to-video episodes made before being scrapped entirely.
-   In _Samurai Jack_, Jack has spent 50 years without aging a single day between Seasons 4 and 5, with at least one incident happening during that period of time causing him to lose his spirit. The episode titles even lampshade this, with the season premiere being labeled Episode "XCII" rather than "LIII", cheekily implying a few dozen significant events have been skipped over.
-   _The Secret Saturdays_ has this to start off the third season. Six months have passed and in that time: the Saturdays have become fugitives, with the Secret Scientists wanting to freeze Zak for eternity and the world blaming them for Argost's disappearance. Other things include Van Rook becoming broke and homeless, Zak's powers going haywire, and Doyle becoming a James Bond\-like spy for the Saturday family.
-   In the _SpongeBob SquarePants_ episode "I Was A Teenage Gary", after SpongeBob leaves for the convention, Squidward gets ready to relax...then it jumps to three days later when SpongeBob is coming home and Squidward neglected Gary the whole time.
    -   In "SB-129", the episode skips 2000 years into the future with Squidward frozen in the freezer.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_: There's a timeskip ten episodes into season three to give the impression of the Clone Wars dragging out endlessly (since the war only takes place in the three-year time period between _Attack of the Clones_ and _Revenge of the Sith_), providing an opportunity for new models and wardrobes for the main characters. Many of the characters have been redesigned (particularly Anakin, Obi-Wan, Ahsoka, Yoda, Padmé, and Palpatine), for example, and Ahsoka has created a second lightsaber and takes up Dual Wielding. The series' Anachronic Order also ends after this point (with the exception of "Revival", aired as the season 5 premiere but set later in the season).
    -   Another timeskip took place between Season 6 and the Un-Cancelled Season 7, with Anakin and Obi-Wan now in their _Revenge of the Sith_ outfits and the conflict starting to wind down. It gives the impression that the three periods of the show take place in each year of the war.
-   _Star Wars Rebels_: The series regularly has brief timeskips of between a few weeks and a few months between episodes.
    -   The last scene of "Path of the Jedi" takes place several weeks after the rest of the episode.
    -   A six-month timeskip takes place between Season 2 finale "Twilight of the Apprentice" and Season 3 premiere "Steps Into Shadow". The characters have changed significantly over that time, partly in reaction to what happened at the end of season 2.
    -   In the series finale, Sabine in the Distant Finale narrates a timeskip that covers the entire period during which _Rogue One_, _A New Hope_, _The Empire Strikes Back_, and _Return of the Jedi_ take place. The skip ends with a Sequel Hook.
-   _Superjail!_: There is a timeskip between the second season finale and the season three premiere.
-   _Steven Universe_ has the television movie take place two years after the finale, with the _Future_ miniseries picking up a few months after that.
-   _Total Drama_:
    -   _Action_ had a time skip from the finale, to the later special and the third season. It's not known exactly how long, although a year is probably the best guess (enough time for about half of Heather's hair to grow back, and most of them to try to grasp fame and fail at it).
    -   The 2023 reboot of _Island_ is explicitly stated to take place 15 years after the original _Island_, which took place in the Summer of 2007, placing the reboot in the Summer of 2022.
-   _The Transformers_ skipped about 20 years (from then present 1985 to 2005) between the last episode of the second season and The Movie, during which Cybertron fell to the Decepticons and two of the four biggest Transformers ever were built. There is also a timeskip in the Japanese animated continuity - there is a one-year gap between the end of _Transformers 2010_ (American season 3) and _The Headmasters_.
-   _Transformers: Rescue Bots_ sees Season 4 skip a few years after the first three seasons, reflected by Cody and Frankie being teenagers and the latter getting a baby sister. The series also takes place in the Transformers Aligned Universe, with the first three seasons being concurrent with _Transformers: Prime_ and the fourth being concurrent with _Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015)_, a fact reflected by Bumblebee going from talking with the beeps he did through most of _Prime_ and his _Rescue Bots_ appearances in the first two seasons, to being voiced by Will Friedle, as in the final four episodes of _Prime_ and _RiD_. Sideswipe from _RiD_ also appears.
-   Inverted with _Wacky Races_ spinoffs _Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines_ and _The Perils of Penelope Pitstop._ _Races_ took place during the time of its production, 1968, while the spinoffs are set decades earlier. Then again, Dick Dastardly and Muttley would reappear in their Vulture Squadron attire in 1985's _Yogi's Treasure Hunt_.
-   Every Season of _Young Justice (2010)_ takes place a certain number of years after the previous season. Season 2: Invasion takes place 5 years after the first season, Season 3: Outsiders takes place 2 years after season 2, and Season 4: Phantoms takes place a year after season 3.
