_Yarvis was almost certain he'd seen the same tree an hour ago, but then again, didn't all trees look alike? He shelved his doubts and followed the friendly, twinkling motes deeper into the forest._

A spectral light is spotted upon the misty moors one night. If by chance there are travelers who are lost, the Will-o'-the-Wisp's light is an alluring sight, but a savvy traveler knows that the light of the Wisp may only lead them further astray. The light itself is supposed to resemble a flickering flame. The explanation for the lights is that the areas where the flames were often seen were bogs, and the flames were the result of methane combustion in the air.

What the Will-o'-the-Wisp is depends on the source mythology and the individual work. Sometimes they are wandering ghosts, other times they are fairies, demons or nondescript spirits, and in some works they are simply living creatures with a natural glow and an elaborate hunting strategy. In appearance, they can appear as vague floating lights, humanoids carrying lanterns, buzzing insect-like beings and other, more unusual forms. Most of the time, Wisps are malicious, but on rare occasions they can be helpful. They are usually found in desolate environments, primarily moorland, bogs and marshes, but sometimes also in deep, trackless forests. Why exactly they seem so interested in waylaying travelers can be given any number of reasons. Some versions are simply a bizarre natural or magical phenomenon, while others are mindless or lost spirits who draw people along with them unintentionally. Others act out of cruelty and malice, or else are predators who feed on their victims' spirits, life energy, or fear and despair.

Etymologically, "Will-o'-the-wisp" is an archaism roughly translating to "Will of the torch", "Will" here being the given name, similarly to "Jack of the lantern", as both were described as wandering spirits bearing lights. The Latin name for it is _ignis fatuus_, "fool fire" (plural _ignes fatui_). Historically, they have also been known by a variety of local names such as friar's lanterns, hinkypunks and Wills-o'-the-wyke.

Wills-o'-the-Wisp tend to appear in desolate locations with a macabre history, appearing as vengeful apparitions or a lost soul wandering aimlessly. Wisps in video games function as a (usually) weak enemy found in graveyards or swamps.

See Hitodama Light for ghostly lights of Japanese folklore, Faux Flame for a supernatural illusion of fire conjured up by someone, and Spark Fairy for fairies or magical insects depicted as a point of light. When the wisp is explicitly a living, predatory being, see also Luring in Prey. Supernatural Light is the Super-Trope.

(A note on plurals: historically, the plural form was _Wills_\-o'-the-wisp. Many modern works use will-o'-the-_wisps_ instead. Having to choose, prioritize how the work being discussed spells it.)

     Anime and Manga 

-   _Digimon_: Kyuubimon's Onibidama is an attack in form of nine ghostly fireballs fired from the tips of its nine tails.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   The attack Will'o-wisp is initially portrayed as an offensive attack, unlike in the games where it's just a status debuff. In the games, it wouldn't affect Fire-types, but in the anime, Ash's Charizard got his by this attack as if it's a regular attack. Later generations would depict this attack correctly.
    -   All of Ash's Fire-types (except Incineroar) teach his Gengar how to learn Will-o'wisp, even though none of them actually know this move themselves. Gengar manages to learn it and uses it on Paul's Metagross to inflict the Burn status on it and win the battle. Gengar continues to use this move during the Master Tournament.
-   Invoked in _Pumpkin Scissors_. The 901st used Bottled Heroic Resolve in the form of a special kind of lamp oil burning at a specific frequency of blue light that drove them Ax-Crazy. At a distance, at night, this looked like Will O' the Whisps, and a legend sprang up around them that they were evil ghosts "guided by the Will-of-the-Wisp".

Its original text consist of lines from _The Rime of the Ancient Mariner_ describing ghost-fires on the sea, while its modern one references an in-universe myth of the ghost of a deceased woman wandering the moors at night with a lantern in hand, trying to find her lost brother and dooming the living who meet her to join in her endless search.

In its last appearance, Fi traps it on a floppy disc, keeping it captive and harmless indefinitely.

    Music

    Mythology 

-   In Brazilian Folklore, will o' wisps were said to be the Boitatá, an enormous fire serpent that went after hunters and loggers. Similar to a basilisk, its blinding brightness could drive people insane or cause death. Oddly enough, it could also try to crush people by turning into a burning tree trunk and in the state of Santa Catarina it was depicted as a cyclopean bull instead.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Jeff Hardy's masked gimmick, Willow The Wisp, in OMEGA. In TNA, it is stated Willow is nothing but a figment of Jeff Hardy's imagination. Willow's light show makes his surroundings deliberately monochrome.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: Will-o'-wisps are a mainstay of the game's Monster Manuals, depicted as malicious glowing orbs of light that haunt dangerous and deserted places like catacombs, swamps, and bogs with hungry monsters or traps that can kill the unwary (Pit Traps, Quicksand Sucks, etc.). They lure victims into these hazards and feed on their Life Energy (or their pain and fear depending on the edition). And while their behavior is uniformly malevolent across editions, their origins have never been consistent; sometimes they're fey, other times Eldritch Abominations, and still other times a form of undead.
-   _In Nomine_: Will'o'wisps are the least form of ghosts, having sacrificed every part of their spiritual selves save for sheer Will in their struggle to remain anchored to the physical world. They cannot affect the material realm beyond manifesting as balls of light or pockets of cold, and lack the intelligence to do much even if they could do more. They're sad, lonely, wandering things, lacking the ability to let go of the material realm and having long forgotten why they wanted to stay.
-   _Pathfinder_:
    -   Will-o'-wisps are aberrations resembling floating spongy orbs that glow with eery light but can selectively dim and modify their illumination to take on a number of forms — winged humanoids, floating skulls, and so on. They live in lonely bogs, moors and forests, usually alone but rarely in groups called strings or chandeliers, and lure travelers into the wilderness to feed on their fear and life energy when they die. Although they aren't fey, they're fairly common in the First World where the true fey live. In addition to common will-o'-wisps, there's also a large number of variants and related creatures:
        -   Dread wisps haunt the depths of the underground, and feed on despair as well as fear.
        -   Dune candles inhabit the depths of the desert. Their glow burns with true fire, and in addition to luring travelers into the depths of the desert or into areas prone to sandslides, they also enjoy just setting their victims aflame.
        -   Flickerwsips are lesser relatives of will-o'-wisps that resemble three-foot-long clumps of trailing hair that pulse with flickering yellow light. They have similar habits to will-o'-wisps, but feed on confusion and doubt instead of fear, especially the unease of lost travelers.
        -   Groetan candles serve Groetus, the god of the end times, and always take on the appearance of the skull-like moon that is their god. Their fires burn deadly cold.
        -   Voidgluttons are stronger relatives to will-o'-wisps and flickerwisps, and take the form of glowing, disembodied eyes and claws swirling around a seething black core. Their preferred haunts are sites of great misery, such as graveyards, prison camps, and battlefields.
        -   Spellvoids are a variant that, instead of eating emotions, feeds on magic and drains it from living spellcasters.
        -   Will-o'-the-deeps live over seas and occasionally large lakes. They tend to live in groups and use their collective light to create beautiful vistas and beacons that they use to lure ships into reefs and away from safe waters.
    -   The empyreal lord Ashava is a benevolent version of this. Her true form is a hazy sphere of silvery moonlight, and she entices others to follow her so as to lead them home (if they're living) or to the afterlife (if they're dead). Conversely, she despises true will-o'-wisps due to them deliberately leading people astray and encouraging fear of the wilderness and the night.
    -   The Lantern King, one of the Eldest of the fey, resembles a floating orb of light crowned with arcane symbols, endlessly wandering the roads and paths of the First World. He is speculated to be the father of will-o-wisps, in part because of his appearance and in part because he has many in his service, though he laughs off all inquiries on the subject without answer.
    -   Lampads, nymphs who live in cavern systems, can create glowing wisps of magical light, which they use to guide lost travelers to safety and to lure monsters to their doom.
-   _Shadow of the Demon Lord_: Jack-o'-lanterns are malevolent faerie creatures that love to lure travellers to their doom on the moors. From a distance, they appear as plumes of pale fire bobbing in the air, but when approached they transform into orange flames resembling leering faces.
-   _Shadowrun_: The Corpselight, or will o' wisp, is a mysterious magical being that looks like a wisp, floating about two metres above ground in desolate areas. They are solitary and malevolent, draining their victim's essence in a way similar to Vampires.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_:
    -   Marshlights are ethereal undead that cannot physically harm their victims, instead they mesmerise them and lead them into danger. They can only be harmed by magic weapons, which banish them in a single hit.
    -   The Marsh Lights spell allows a caster to create a number of lights within 100 yards of themselves and then send them off in any desired direction.

    Video Games 

-   _Ancient Empires_ has Wisps as a type of unit. They appear as bluish balls of light that increase the attack of nearby allied units. Their attack does increased damage to skeletons, but their base attack is still too weak for this to be effective.
-   _Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magick Obscura_: Several enemies are glowing balls of light found in swampy terrain.
-   _Darkwood_: Glares are strange floating orbs of red light that harm the protagonist if he looks at or touches them. They appear in the Swamp, surrounded by possible high tier loot to draw the protagonist into a deadly area filled with obstacles and traps. They will not harm other enemies, who will gleefully take advantage of the situation to rip you apart, and also appear during two different night events as early as the Old Woods Hideout: one where a Red Glare spawns at random places in the hideout, another where a Red Glare spawns at your current location, forcing you to move in order to avoid it.
-   _Diablo II_: The Willowisp monsters are ethereal undead that are transparent until they use their lightning attack. They shoot incredibly fast, come in packs that will focus fire on one character, and are some of the most prominent Demonic Spiders in the game.
    
    _Created from the vapors that rise from the dense jungle swamps, these mindless forms seek out the energy contained in all living things. While not evil in nature, their feeding habits do make them a serious threat to adventurers._
    
-   _Dragon Age: Origins_: Wisps are demons who lost their power by being in the physical world without a host for too long or by being destroyed, often by other demons. What remains of its mind clings to a hatred of all living things. Wisps mindlessly attack in the Fade while in the physical world, they pose as light sources such as lanterns to lead the living into dangerous areas. The Spell Wisp is a spell from the Creation tree summons a wisp that grants a small bonus to spellpower while maintained.
-   _Eastern Exorcist_ is a supernatural-themed game where several of your enemies are ghosts, while floating ghostly orbs resembling Willow-o'the-Wisps will appear in the graveyard levels. They materialize from orbs to ghosts after a while.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   _Oblivion_ has them as a mid-level monster encounter. They're incorporeal like ghosts (meaning they can only be hurt with magic, weapons made of silver, or magic weapons) and can use lightning-based magic.
    -   _Skyrim_:
        -   _Skyrim_ has glowing hostile creatures called Wisps, which are found near feminine, ghostlike beings called Wispmothers. Unlike the Will-o-the-Wisps in _Oblivion_, these can be hurt by any kind of weapon. Killing a Wispmother disperses the Wisps surrounding her. These also appear in _The Elder Scrolls Online_.
        -   Yngol's Barrow has mysterious orbs of light that follow and surround the Dragonborn, but they are harmless.
-   _Evil Islands_: Willow-o'the-Wisps are enemies that appear on the first island (especially around the swamp areas and around the City of the Dead) as a group of lights that start burning when attacking. They throw fire at you, an attack which isn't very damaging at later stages, but makes them quite a threat when first encountered.
-   _Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates_: An early scene has Latov, Yuri, and Chelinka watching the ignes fatui that hover over Lake Cyela — the ghosts of the people who died there when the Rela Cyel facility collapsed.

-   _Mortal Kombat X_: Ermac (who is a being made of thousands of souls shoved into one body) has green lights similar to these orbiting him in his Master of Souls variation. He can use them as projectiles to temporarily paralyze the opponent.
-   _Nexus War_: _Nexus Clash_ has them as some of the low-level minions of the Lich. They're not very effective in combat but they're cheap, can heal their masters with Life Drain, and their ghostly nature means that even invisible characters can't hide from them.
-   _Night Creatures_: Will o'wisps are slow-moving green lights found in the mire, and explode upon contact.
-   _Overwatch_ references this with the non-canon "Will-o'-the-Wisp" skin for Tracer, redesigning her into a glowing spectre who fires pistols of supernatural fire instead of futuristic energy pulses, and has a new justification for teleporting around beyond time manipulation. The non-canon backstory is that Tracer's spirit was ripped away from her body after a magical accident, but she's come to make peace with the world and uses her powers to her newfound benefit.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Will-O-Wisp (originally named _Onibi_) exists as a status move that inflicts the Burn status on the target Pokemon if it hits. It is commonly learned by Ghost-type and Fire-type Pokemon.
    -   A Pokémon that learns this move is Duskull, which has a light floating in its skull. In German, it's called _Zwirrlicht_, which is a wordplay on _Zwielicht_ (Twilight) and _Irrlicht_ (Will-o'-the-Wisp).
    -   It is also learned by the Litwick line, which take the shape of animated candles (Litwick itself), lamps (Lampent), or candelabra (Chandelure) lit with a ghostly blue flames, which they use to mesmerize people and consume their souls.
-   _Quest for Glory IV_: Will-o'-the-Wisps are the souls of dead children, and they hang around the swamp at night. Following them into the swamp, naturally, is foolish, but they're also there for a good reason. The Hero must capture a few of them in order to find one of the Dark One Rituals.
-   _Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale_: Will-'o-Wisps spawn when you spend too much time on a dungeon floor, The first time you see one, Tear recommends outright that you drop whatever you're doing and make tracks for the level exit. Most of the time, Wisps are not worth fighting due to lack of reward except they are the only enemies to drop Salamander Scales which are needed to make high-level items. Since you need a) _28_ Salamander Scales total to make all possible items once each and b) the drop rate of them is 1:50, you will have to kill a **lot** of these very dangerous enemies if you aim for 100% Completion of the item encyclopedia.
-   _The Rewinder_: Floating flames are a common sight in places containing spirit activity, although despite appearing in large numbers they're merely part of the background.
-   _Resident Evil 4_ has an inversion with the Merchant, in the sense that the lights he marks his shop locations with leads you towards safety. His various campsites are marked from a distance by a strong, blue flame that contrasts the darker environments. At one point, when Ada meets him during the course of Separate Ways, he considers his shop incomplete without it. In the remake, he has both a blue-flamed lantern and the larger lamp burning a purple flame. What's implied is that the reason the Plagas don't bother the Merchant is because of the blue-flamed lantern, the same type that Ashley can use to immobilize the Armaduras Leon has to fight to get the Lion Head in the remake.

-   _The Sims 3_: The "Late Night" Expansion Pack adds wisps that can be caught like butterflies and are quite valuable.

-   _Warcraft_:
    -   _Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos_: Wisps are Nature Spirits that act as the Worker Unit for the Night Elves. Their duties include mining gold from entangled mines, harvesting lumber without killing trees, creating buildings or being consumed to make Ancients. They also have the Detonate ability that blows the wisp up to drain mana, damage summoned units, and dispel buffs.
        
        Wisps also show up as a Lethal Joke Character in the final level, where the goal is to prevent the demon lord Archimonde from reaching the World Tree as more Wisps gather around it. When the level ends, the ending cinematic has the titanic demon lord start scaling the tree... then the Wisps start rushing him and use a mass Detonate, killing him with a World-Wrecking Wave (also a case of Cutscene Power to the Max, since Archimonde is immune to magic in gameplay, the Detonate spell wouldn't affect him, much less deal damage).
        
    -   In _World of Warcraft_, Night Elves turn into wisps when they die, allowing them to move much faster than the ghosts of other races and therefore resurrect quicker. Blizzard announced that Wisps would be a playable race for an April Fools' Day joke in 2006.
-   _We Know the Devil_: Venus sometimes sees these in the distance. It is a character tic that hints towards her element, and the nature she takes on when possessed.
