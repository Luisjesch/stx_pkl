Each rose represents a molecule of my heart that is yours.

**Kirk:** Shall we pick some flowers, Doctor? When a man visits an old girlfriend, she usually expects something like that.  
**McCoy:** Is that how you get girls to like you, by bribing them?

For centuries, flowers have been one of the main components of romance, relationships, and sometimes even sex.

Flowers are used, primarily, within these four contexts:

-   The context of courting and inviting, when one character gives to another a single flower or a bunch of flowers (normally in a bouquet), for example. Flowers may also appear in special celebrations, like the one year anniversary of a relationship or, especially, on Valentine's day;
-   The context of mending issues with their relationship, with the character who gives usually asking for forgiveness or a pardon. There's also the possibility of flowers being given to symbolize a breakup;
-   The context of dancing. Usually, it's the male who seduces the female with a flower, by running the flower across her body and/or lips. Alternatively, grabbing a flower with his teeth and mouth is also popular imagery;
-   The context of sex. Usually, there are petals on a bed, for example, although sometimes the flowers in their entirety may appear. In this case, put only the examples that have the flower/flowers in its/their entirety or very noteworthy scenes with lots of petals.

For bonus points, if there is a heavy presence of Flower Motifs, write down its symbolic/intentional significance, if possible.

They're sometimes seen as either part of or on its own as a Grand Romantic Gesture. It is also often paired with Chocolate of Romance.

Roses and forget-me-nots are among the most common romance-associated flowers in the West. There is overlap between Flowers of Romance and Something about a Rose, but the latter also covers of non-romantic examples. In Japanese fiction, expect to see Cherry Blossoms and lilies at some point.

Sometimes the recipient may react badly to being given such a gift, saying that Picked Flowers Are Dead. A suitor who has done their homework will instead gift live flowers in a pot.

Often overlaps with Chocolate of Romance or Garden of Love. Compare/contrast The Tragic Rose and Love Bubbles (aka Love Flowers). See also Queer Flowers for when LGBT characters hint at their romantic feelings through this trope. See also Distracted by the Luxury. Compare and contrast Alluring Flowers, which are often thematically or directly linked to sexual desire.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _After War Gundam X_, one of the earliest signs that Garrod is beginning to fall in love with Tiffa is that, when she's in the sickbay and he's under punishment in a cell, he sneaks out... but only to get her some flowers. Then he returns to the cell without any complaints.
-   Subverted in _Full Metal Panic!_ when Sousuke gives Kaname a bouquet of poppies as an apology for forgetting a study date. She's quite happy with them right up until he starts explaining how to harvest opium from them.
-   In _Fushigi Yuugi_, Soi and Nakago are having sex, and flowers are shown in front of them. Ironically, although Soi loves Nakago, it's debatable how he feels about _her,_ and they're sleeping together because Soi has sexual healing powers.
-   In _Hetalia: Axis Powers_, Germany gives flowers (and a ring) to Italy in the "San Valentino" comic.
-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_:
    -   An early chapter used this as part of a psychological test the Student Council took, where the number of flowers you wanted to take from a field revealed how big your crush was.
    -   Back in middle school, Miko received an anonymous letter of encouragement from one of her classmates that had a flower enclosed. It's unknown if the sender meant for it to be romantic, but she clearly views it as such (she had it laminated and keeps it as a good luck charm). It's heavily implied at the time and later confirmed that it was sent by Ishigami, though he admits that there wasn't meant to be any romantic meaning behind it.
    -   Given that his mother works as a florist, Ishigami's default idea for a romantic gesture involves offering flowers that have some sort of obtuse meaning behind them (such as their species names forming a backronym for a message). Kaguya has to keep convincing him that such things would come across as creepy rather than romantic.
    -   In the final chapter, Kaguya prepares a surprise for Shirogane by arranging for the entire school to celebrate him "graduating" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  with the rest of their graduating class throwing the flowers on their lapels in the air as a recreation of the balloons from his Grand Romantic Gesture to her back during the culture festival.
-   In the ending credits of the final episode of _Kill la Kill_, Gamagoori is seen holding a bouquet of roses almost certainly intended for Mako.

-   _Ranma ½_: Pompous Jerkass Tatewane Kuno offers a bouquet of roses to the "tree-borne kettle girl," not knowing her name, and unaware that she's Ranma in his girl form. Ranma is too flummoxed by this to react. His sister, Kodachi Kuno, also gifts a bouquet of red roses to Ranma while he's in his rightful male form. However, Kodachi tends to bestow black roses to adversaries as a veiled threat.
-   Considering the constant and fundamental presence of flowers in _Revolutionary Girl Utena_, it's quite amazing that the truly romantic moment involving roses only happened in the 1999 movie that featured the The Big Damn Kiss between Utena and Anthy. Although one could say that they also play a relatively important part in the series, just more subtly.
-   In a _Rurouni Kenshin_ filler anime episode, after Kaoru gets comically depressed over an Accidental Marriage deal with Kenshin falling through, Kenshin makes it up to her by bringing her flowers.

-   In _Tamagotchi! Yume Kira Dream_ episode 19, a rose is the item Yumecantchi summons for Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi to use to help get Righttchi's opponent Robosukitchi to a tea-serving robot competition they're facing off in. That rose ends up being given as a gift to a woman Robosukitchi really admires before both are brought to the site of the competition.

-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: Jaune brings Yang flowers on their first date. Yang is _extremely_ flustered, not least because she only asked him out by accident.

    **Jaune:** Really? I could always get you some more.  
    **Yang:** _\[giggles, slightly panicked\]_
