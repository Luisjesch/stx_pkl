**Valerius:** Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?  
**Maximus:** Home... Wife, son, the harvest.  
**Quintus:** Maximus the farmer... I still have difficulty imagining that.  
**Maximus:** You know, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

Someone who is in the position where they could do something much more significant, but still chooses an agricultural job for sentimental reasons.

When done with badass fighters, it is often used to symbolize that after seeing so much destruction and violence, they want a chance to actually do something constructive, put down some roots, and see some new growth, maybe as a way of dealing with post traumatic stress. In brief, instead of destroying life, they now seek to raise and maintain it. It might overlap with Real Men Wear Pink, especially when it is about flowers, or gardening, to show that this tough man always secretly wished for such a non-violent, nurturing pastime. For others, the pastoral life is particularly sweet because they've lived their entire lives on the move and this is the first place they can really call home, or maybe _this_ is what they have _really_ been fighting for all along (soldiers Fighting for a Homeland, for example).

It may turn out to be a harder job than they originally thought.

When it is professional agriculture, like farming, it often happens with politically or socially important figures, to show that they wish to be mere workers of the land. They might make snarky comments informing us that in fact, this is the first _really_ useful thing they've done. This sort of response is typical of the Cincinnatus, possibly an Ur-Example.

There are practical reasons for this as well. Being a good soldier requires waking up early, being punctual, and working hard under a rigid structure. Being a good farmer requires waking up early, doing chores punctually, and working hard under a strict timetable for planting and harvesting.

Later episodes establish that Goku is actually quite good at it and that his vegetables are very popular at the local farmer's market.

    Art 

-   Pieter Bruegel the Elder made many paintings about peasants and their daily lives. He especially admired the farmers and their hard work on the field.
-   _L'Angelus<small>◊</small>_ by Jean-François Millet a farmer couple are saying the Angelus<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  to close off the work day. (Millet could have intended at first to show the couple praying above the grave of their dead child. Salvador Dalí saw a copy of it as a kid, said he just had a feeling about it, and years later insisted that the Louvre x-ray the painting. Sure enough, the basket has what _might_ be a tiny coffin next to it which has been painted over. Millet could have started out to do a take on Courbet's _Burial at Ornans_, then changed it and put the church in the background, saying later he remembered his grandmother back on the farm always made the kids pause to say the Angelus.)

    Comic Books

-   _Dreadstar_: Vanth Dreadstar should be the ultimate example: the man destroys the entire MILKY WAY GALAXY, escapes to a different galaxy, and then he becomes a farmer. (Granted, it ended up simply being a 30-40 year "break", before he became involved in an all-out war in his NEW galaxy...)
-   _Firefly: Brand New 'Verse_ has Simon and Kaylee running a farm. Simon is a brilliant trauma surgeon, but he lost his chance to practice pretty much anyplace when he broke River out of the Academy. He could have probably made it as a doctor on one of the less controlled border worlds, though. And Kaylee is a skilled mechanic in her own right. They both liked being on _Serenity's_ crew, but probably decided settling somewhere would be better and less dangerous since they have kids by this story.

    **Vril:** Do not worry, officer: I am a _botanist_!
    
-   _Transmetropolitan_ ends with Spider Jerusalem, having fulfilled his contracts and taken down the bad guy, moving back up the mountain and growing vegetables.

-   _The Night Unfurls_: Kyril's wish is to own a farm and live out the rest of his life in peace after everything is over.

-   Arsène Lupin retired to garden for the Kaiser. And be the Man Behind the Man of Germany.
-   _Aubrey-Maturin_: Jack Aubrey opens _The Mauritius Command_ stuck in a tiny cottage, the great garden he dreamed of in previous books filled with puny wormy cabbages. As he's used to ship's food, the worms don't bother him so much. In general, Aubrey is a subversion of this trope: though he periodically makes plans for estates or agricultural projects, they're ill-fated, and he always goes back to sea (and to war) with relief.
-   Played straight in the _Bazil Broketail_ series. The final novel ends with the main character Relkin and his dragon Bazil retiring to a life of farming after their term of military service is up — ironically the very life they joined the military to avoid.

-   _The Black Arrow_: After surviving The Hundred Years' War, the old archer Nick Appleyard became semi-retired, so he planted an orchard and started growing cabbages.

-   Lampshaded in _Brotherhood Of The Rose_ by David Morrell. A retirement village for spies on the run has a high suicide rate which the man running it has to constantly hush up.

The Spymaster Elliot boasts that thanks to his love of rose-growing, he'll survive and thrive. So in an effort to drive him out of the Truce Zone, the protagonist destroys his rose garden.

    -   _The Discworld Companion_ says this in Vetinari's entry:
        
        _The Patrician has expressed a wish that, one day, he could retire and cultivate a garden. It will probably never happen. It is impossible to imagine him as a mere civilian. But if he did indeed take up horticulture, the roses would grow in lines, the garden would bloom on command — and the slugs would eat the caterpillars._

    -   Éowyn and Faramir do this as well. Though they technically end up _ruling_ the province of Ithilien, talk as if they're hearing the call to stop fighting take up gardening, and growing things instead of killing them.
        
        **Éowyn**: I will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor vie with the great Riders, nor take joy only in the songs of slaying. I will be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren. No longer do I desire to be a queen.  
        **Faramir**: That is well, for I am not a king... Let us cross the River and in happier days let us dwell in fair Ithilien and there make a garden. All things will grow with joy there, if the White Lady comes.

-   _Star Wars Legends_:
    -   _I, Jedi_: Main character Corran Horn's step-grandfather Rostek became a rather well-known horticulturist after retiring from CorSec, secreting the works of Persecuted Intellectuals and other banned information in his plants' genetic codes.

    -   In the _Hand of Thrawn_ Duology — it is revealed that Baron Fel was chosen to be the template for clones specifically to invoke this trope, so they would fight to defend their homes. It worked TOO well: the Devists decided that their loyalty to their land and families outweighed their loyalty to the Empire.
    -   The novel _The Old Republic: Deceived_ ends with the Republic-soldier-turned-spice-runner Zeerid Korr buying a farm and settling down with his daughter. He is then joined by Aryn Leneer, a Jedi Knight who has quit the order and has come to be with him.

In the final episode she asks the Machine, "Is this the part where you tell me that I should live out the rest of my days in peace? Grow an herb garden or something?"

Sure enough, when the other members of Team Machine have died or retired, Shaw is shown eagerly accepting another Number.

After his horrific experience with the Borg, he visits his family vineyard on Earth during his recuperation; while there he briefly considers giving up his Starfleet career to lead the tantalizingly mysterious "Atlantis project", which seems to have something to do with creating or making livable new land on or from the ocean floor - not only growing new life, but creating the space to house life.

In _Star Trek: Picard_, we see that Picard has indeed retired from Starfleet to run his family farm by this time, albeit leaving Starfleet on much more tragic terms.

    I'm gonna work the straw, make the sweat drip out of every pore_
    
-   Russian folk-rockers Otava Yo introduce this theme in a lot of their videos and the accompanying songs. A repeating theme in the videos is a sort of idealised Russia where simple peasant farmers strip everything back to the basics and live a happy healthy life.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Champions_ sourcebook "The Circle and M.E.T.E.". The Master is an extremely powerful sorcerer who once worked against the Allied forces during WW2. After surviving the atomic destruction of Hiroshima, he retired and created the Garden, an underground area filled with plants where he lives.
-   One reason why Shadowdale in the _Forgotten Realms_ has successfully weathered an awful lot of monster attacks, despite its small population and lack of heavy fortifications, is that several high-level player characters from Ed Greenwood's home D&D campaigns wrapped up their adventuring careers by heeding this trope and starting farms there.
-   In _Magic: The Gathering_, one of the most iconic white spells, "Swords to Plowshares", invokes this. It removes a creature from the game and gives its owner its power in life points. It is a reference to Isaiah 2:4 in _The Bible_.
    
    My mind has changed. My strength has not.
    
    -   Though this shift in attitude is played tragically straight in the block's story: After receiving the Mirari, Kamahl promptly lost his damn mind and went on a rampage, culminating in the death of his sister, Jeska, and ultimately causing her rebirth as Phage the Untouchable.

    Is to me a keen enjoyment,  
    For I'm naturally diffident and meek!

-   In _Blade & Soul_, the player character briefly considers throwing away their game-long goal to get rid of Jinsoyun at one point to become a farmer because it would be a simpler, less stressful life than being a martial artist. In the end, however, they decided that taking down Jinsoyun must be done and if they don't do it, no one else will. The player character can also help the villagers in Windrest, where they can fish, grow wheat and raise pigs for their students in exchange for upgrade materials.
-   One of the endings of _Brave Soul_ has the main character and his girlfriend getting stranded on an island with a crate of cursed agricultural tools that force anyone who touches them to work for a given amount of time. The final scene shows them like this.
-   _Cobalt Core_ Parodies this when Drake reveals to Smiff just what happened to a former Sidekick of hers. Namely, he gave up the pirate life in favor of settling down to become a farmer... something she considers far _worse_ than if he'd gotten killed in action or stabbed her in the back. Smiff expresses his sincere condolences for her loss.
-   Eirik of _Dead In Vinland_ is a Reluctant Warrior in the first place; he once participated in a Viking raid, which he regrets, and all he wants is to live a quiet peaceful life with his family.

-   One story arc in _Final Fantasy XIV_ deals with this. In the starting quests for the coastal city of Limsa Lominsa, you deal with the former pirates who are having trouble transitioning from bloodthirsty killers to farmers, and the Starter Villain is one such pirate who didn't like this enough to debate going to the serpent reavers.
    -   Inverted in the most literal sense with the Reaper job. The first Reapers were once pureblood Garlean farmers who were driven from their homes by invaders, forcing them to tap into the Void to gain dark powers (pureblood Garleans cannot naturally manipulate aether), allowing them to fight back while using their scythes as weapons.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   If you recruit General Wallace in the first official English release and keep him alive until the end, his epilogue with read that, after somehow winding up in Ilia, he spends the remainder of his days tilling the soil up there. Of course, he'd become a farmer after 30 years' worth of service as a knight to the Caelin house before he joins you, anyway, so it'd really be more correct to say that he went BACK to farming....

-   _Guilty Gear_: In a manner of speaking, the ending of -STRIVE- has Sol stripped of his Gear powers and returned to a human, living a peaceful life with Aria in a machine parts shop.
-   In _Harvest Moon_ this trope appears in most every game. Justified, since its a farming game. Most games have your Father die, with you taking his place. One notable time where this 'didn't' happen was _Story of Seasons (2014)_, where the Player Character, having been raised in a mostly Urban area, always wanted to be a farmer, so upon seeing an ad for working on a farm in the rural boondocks, you sprung at the chance.
-   Agent 47 from _Hitman_ became a gardener at a church following the events of _Codename 47_. Too bad the Mafia had to kidnap the local priest....

-   A depressing version occurs in _Mace: The Dark Age_. Mordos Kull's bad ending has him retire from mercenary work after failing to kill Asmodeus. He becomes a farm hand, but Asmodeus has fouled the soil, and the farmers cannot even afford to share their harvest with him.

-   When you're not exploring new lands, fighting off monsters, or building structures in _Minecraft_, you're probably farming resources. It's not hard to see why, either — farming is very low-risk, not very resource-intensive, gives you food to keep you going, and if you know the right villagers to trade with, can prove very profitable.
-   Jax in _Mortal Kombat X_, after being restored from his revenant form. He ultimately returns to the battlefield when Sonya asks for his help.
-   In the games where it exists as a mechanics, growing berries is one of the few things left to the player in _Pokémon_ after beating it.
-   In _Quest for Glory I_, you come across a centaur raking his field. In fact, that's all you ever see him do. But his description states that he looks very strong and has had his fair share of battles. If you attempt to fight him, the game simply won't let you, implying that it's _not_ a good idea.
-   In between the events of _Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2_ and _Rocket Knight (2010)_, it is revealed that Sparkster, the leader of the Rocket Knights, took up farming, got married, and even raised a son. During Sparkster's absence, his arch-rival and Evil Counterpart, Axel Gear, became the new leader of the Rocket Knights, but Sparkster returns to the Kingdom of Zephyrus when it is under attack by the Wolf Army and later, the Devotindos Empire, which was Axel Gear's plan all along.
-   Weber/Kross from _Rune Factory Frontier_.
    -   Hell, the whole _Rune Factory_ franchise might count, being a spinoff of its sister-series, Harvest Moon. Both the protagonists and their neighbors across all games dabble in the battlefield as much as they do in the sowing field, with varying degrees of success.
-   _Stardew Valley_ opens with your character leaving their Soul-Crushing Desk Job at Joja Corporation to take over the farm they inherited from their grandfather.
-   Invoked by Pacifist star nations with the "Agrarian Idyll" civic in _Stellaris_.

Rolling in one housing, entertainment and employment for pops can allow for powerful, non-specialised planets with very high raw resource generation and population growth.
-   Monomachus the Veteran Instructor and big guy in _Tears to Tiara 2_. Though he didn't let Hamil know until he died. Hamil prefers traveling. But part of his Aura Plan is to allow agriculture to flourish all over the empire.
-   Largo in _Valkyria Chronicles_. He always had a dream to have a vegetable garden, and eventually he did.

He retired with his family to Nagrand to live as a simple farmer, but was forced to rejoin the Horde when Sylvanas sent assassins.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_: This is Colony 9's subplot after the heroes liberate it. Fed up with a life of meaningless warfare, the commander decides to turn the colony's resources towards growing crops. Most of the sidequests found in the area deal with the results of this decision, such as dealing with subordinates who disapprove of the idea or helping the commander consult with other colonies who know more about how to farm properly. Notably, given that the concept of agriculture had been largely lost to the majority of the colonies, the party and commander encounter several pitfalls with their attempts to transition to it, such as blights, droughts, foraging monsters, and their first successful crops not being of an edible plant to begin with.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Checkerboard Nightmare_, Vaporware gets ticked that the only narrative roles available to robots are to angst about his non-humanity or go on indiscriminate killing sprees. He and his robot brethren rebel against this by farming.
    
    **Vaporware:** Strawberry farming provides me with total fulfillment. No failure to understand creation and what drives me here. No latent insecurities about being a soulless automaton here.  
    **Lyle:** I notice you and your robot friends just seem to be crushing strawberries in your fists.  
    **Vaporware:** I like to pretend that each one is one of mankind's goals.
    
-   The main protagonist of _Cucumber Quest_, a wizard-in-training with considerable talent, wants nothing more than to be "that nice old guy people go to for help with their crops or something" when he grows up. Too bad he's been volunteered to go save the world instead of getting a chance to go to magic school.

In the story's main timeframe, his great-grandson ends up a stowaway to a military crew exploring what has become a Forbidden Zone and his original job as a sheep herder contributes to emphasize just how out of place he is.
-   In _Solo Farming In The Tower_, Park Sejun is a relatively poor Korean who gets himself stranded inside one of the mysterious towers that began appearing all over the world. Stuck in a hole, and far away from discovery by any of the other people who have become Adventurers in the tower, he begins growing the groceries he had on hand at the time in order to survive. With the help of some friendly rabbit-monsters and other creatures, he ends up getting pretty good at it, and the Dragon in charge of the tower even makes him a Farmer(as a Character Class).

    Real Life 

-   In real life this was often driven by necessity. The vast majority of humanity for the vast majority of human history was focused on where their next meal was coming from, with the knowledge that food surpluses could be fleeting if they existed and often didn't. Most of the human population outside the elites had to work painstakingly bringing in food to feed everyone, and luck of the draw meant often times THAT wasn't enough. Moreover, outside of raw necessity there was a good chance farming was what you knew and felt comfortable doing. So it didn't matter if you were the savior of the realm in a legendary battle or champion of the people in an important issue, eventually you had to either go back to bringing in a harvest/flock or overseeing those who were.
-   Diocletian, the Emperor who ended the Crisis of the Third Century (i.e. the fifty-year period of successive Klingon Promotions for Roman Emperor) and invented serfdom in the West, setting the stage for the ultimate division of the Roman Empire, decided to retire to a big palace in Spalatum (now Split, Croatia) after 21 years on the throne. He spent most of the time gardening, and when asked to retake the throne, Diocletian replied: "If you could show the cabbage that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed."
-   Cincinnatus, who returned from his farm to assume absolute power over Rome for six months while the city faced an invasion. Having repulsed and conquered the invaders in three weeks, he gave up his dictatorship and went back home. Years later, he was called back to deal with an internal threat (an aristocrat was reportedly plotting to become the King): he came, summoned said aristocrat to defend himself from the accusations, had him killed and returned home. Within a day.
-   Feudalism IS basically this trope. Every knight and soldier was given a land grant to cultivate - which they then would cultivate and grant the rest to their own vassals as fief, all the way to the serfs, who were allotted land, but who were bound to it. Since agriculture is hard work, it also kept the knights and the soldiers fit. There is a saying in Spain that "only military and agriculture are honest trades".
-   Hitler's architect Albert Speer helped design and plant the garden in the Spandau Prison. He then spent all his free time walking around it, counting his laps. He was trying to walk around the world, you see.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Nice "Pride Goeth Before a Fall"-story: for all his power and grandiose plans for "Germania", this garden is the only thing of his projects that wasn't bombed, never built because of the war or demolished after the war (in Berlin, that is). <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   According to his journal, he also spent a couple of weeks drawing a modest house for one of his American guards as a farewell present (shades of season one of _Prison Break_ there...).
-   Inversion: Early Zionists thought this part of the way to make themselves into badass Israelis, not as a way to retire.
-   Several US presidents after leaving office:
    -   After two terms as President of the United States, George Washington retired to manage his plantation, earning him the nickname "The American Cincinnatus". The city of Cincinnati was named in reference to this nickname in his honor.
    -   John Adams and Thomas Jefferson did the same, although Jefferson's Monticello was a slaveholding plantation as well (so he managed it rather than toiling himself) and Adams was more a gentleman gardener.
    -   George W. Bush retired to his Texas ranch.
    -   Subverted with Jimmy Carter, who'd _planned_ to resume running his peanut farm after his presidency, but discovered that the trustees who'd held it in a blind trust during his single term had mismanaged it into bankruptcy.
    -   Dwight D. Eisenhower served two terms as President then retired to a farm near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The farm was donated to the United States National Park Services in 1967.
-   Wittgenstein retired to become a monastery gardener after writing his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, reasoning that with its publication, all philosophy was now completed.
-   Justified Trope: During the Three Kingdoms period in China, Cao Cao (as seen in _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_) mandated that the army re-cultivate the land ravaged by war.
    -   Quite a few famous philosophers and poets retired (or were forcibly exiled) to a life of gardening after trying out working for the Man and becoming disillusioned with the political system (or pissed off the wrong guy).
-   After surviving a life-threatening brain aneurysm during their 1995-96 tour, R.E.M. drummer Bill Berry retired from rock to work a farm in Georgia about a half-hour's drive from Athens.
-   Britpop band Blur's bassist Alex James produces cheese nowadays.
-   Roman legionnaires who'd served a lifetime tour of duty (about 20-25 years) could be granted farmland in lands they'd served in or helped conquer.
-   As World War II drew to a close the Willys-Overland company began to envision potential civilian markets for the Jeep. One of the first was as a "4-in 1" farm vehicle, taking over the roles of light tractor and stationary engine as well as a transporter that was both off-road capable and street-legal. While the first two roles never came to pass, the Land Rover Series I was based loosely on the same design, going on to become an Iconic Item for British farmers, gamekeepers and many other rural occupations ever since. The trope ended up coming full-circle a few years later when the Land Rover was selected as the Boring, but Practical option to replace the Jeep in British Army service, after the non-success of an Awesome, but Impractical custom-built replacement, the Austin Champ.
    -   For that matter, tens of thousands of individual Jeeps and other light utility vehicles were sold off as surplus after the war, many of which found their way into the agricultural sector.
-   Speaking of World War II, many veterans of the war discharged and went to agrarian lifestyles. One of the more famous was Major Richard "Dick" Winters, of the 101st Airborne, Easy Company. He reportedly made a promise to himself at the end of D-Day that he would find a farm somewhere after the war and spend the rest of his life there. After the war, he actually went to work at Nixon Nitration Works for a few years, but by the 1990s, he did, in fact, own a farm and grow crops and raise animals. Far from being just a simple farmer, however, he was quite rich, having patented an effective fertilizer, among other things. He also became a pacifist.
-   Raduan Nassar, a acclaimed Brazilian writer, quit literature in 1984, after only two novels and some short stories, to become a successful farmer without any explanations. In 2012, he sold / donated most of his lands, again, leaving everyone perplexed.
-   This has helped many veterans returning from the recent unpleasantness.
-   The cult leader Jim Jones did this in Jonestown. He stated that the settlement was highly self-sufficient and they got everything they needed of the land. However, the residents faced severe shortages, and a storm ruined their harvest. This is an example of how the trope doesn't always work out, especially if run by a sinister megalomaniac.
-   A less odious version was Stephen Gaskin's "The Farm", whose idealistic founders were inspired by LSD visions. It is still around today, but had to undergo philosophical changes in order to survive.
-   Near the end of the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong sent thousands of members of his Red Guard to the field. According to him, it was an opportunity for them to learn from the peasants. But he did it to get rid of them, as their witch hunts for suspected traitors were tearing the country apart.
-   Simo Häyhä (1905-2002), often said to have been _the_ most lethal soldier in existence, returned to his life as a farmer and hunter after World War II. He would become a successful moose hunter and dog breeder until the day he passed away.
-   Kenji Miyazawa, author of Night on the Galactic Railroad, gave up teaching at Hanamaki Agricultural School in 1926 to farm the land.
-   1979 Formula One champion Jody Scheckter currently spends most of his time as a biodynamic farmer. This includes buying, owning, and operating the Laverstoke Park Farm, a 2500-acre farm located near Overton, Hampshire, England.
-   Taylor Swift has stated that she plans to primarily spend her retirement years gardening.
-   The '80s pop star Kim Wilde once wrote a book on gardening.
-   After becoming the first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong took up residence on and managed a dairy farm in Lebanon, Ohio with his wife.
-   Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) was a hardline ultra-conservative known for being anti-black, anti-LGBT, anti-social programs and everything else, but he never forgot his rural beginnings and was concerned for small farmers. His agricultural bulletins ran on rural radio networks for decades. Five minutes of listening to Jesse Helms talk about beans. You'd never know it was the same man.
-   More generally, planting and maintaining a large garden or small farm is a common way to spend one's retirement, to the point of being a minor stereotype amongst Italian-Americans (see the entry for The Godfather above).
