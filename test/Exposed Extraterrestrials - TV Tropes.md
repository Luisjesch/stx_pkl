The smartest being in the universe can't waste time wearing pants.

_"You have intergalactic starships, but you don't have goddamned pants? How does a civilization's evolution just skip over that part?"_

Works that combine humans with non-human characters will often have the non-humans walking around stark naked (or as close as the Moral Guardians will allow) as they go about their everyday business. Genitals are never shown (or at least nothing that would be immediately recognizable as genitals to a human is); at best, these beings might wear a Seashell Bra or Fur Bikini to avoid Squicking their human companions.

While they will seldom mention any discomfort, savvy viewers might wonder how they regulate their body temperature or protect against environmental dangers, especially if they lack fur, feathers, scales, or something comparable. If the topic is raised, it'll usually be justified as either a religious or cultural norm, or Bizarre Alien Biology.

One might also wonder about the lack of pockets, though this might also be an issue for normally dressed humans in some settings.

Functionally, this helps to emphasize the otherworldly nature of the characters, as it contrasts the awkwardness of undressed humans against the easy comfort of the naked aliens/fairies/demons/whatever. It's also an easy excuse to provide some Fanservice or comedy, though almost always averted with Human Aliens. It can also simply be a form of cutting corners. After all, designing an otherworldly organism can be enough of a challenge without having to also design an otherworldly fashion sense.

May be an Innocent Fanservice Girl or Shameless Fanservice Girl if the character is a Green-Skinned Space Babe.

Also see Barbie Doll Anatomy, Fur Is Clothing, Monster Modesty, Our Nudity Is Different, and Non-Humans Lack Attributes. Creatures with a Clothing Appendage may _look_ clothed but actually be this. Compare National Geographic Nudity for a concept a little closer to home. Contrast with Little Green Man in a Can. The opposite trope of Enclosed Extraterrestrials. Not to be confused with a Broken Masquerade, which involves extraterrestrials (or otherworldly beings in general) being "exposed" to the skeptical masses.

    Anime And Manga 

-   _Dragon Ball Z_. Freeza and his brother Cooler wear nothing at all in their final forms. Their father King Cold wears only a cape, chest armor and Underwear of Power. Played With, as supplementary materials reveal the white (or other colors) parts of their bodies are actually a 'bio suit' their species is capable of generating, essentially being clothing generated from their bodies. Which means that while Freeza's final form _looks_ naked, he's actually wearing full body armor.
-   _Oh, My Sweet Alien!_: While she wears clothes in her Full-Body Disguise, the alien wife much prefers to be naked. It's actually a major part of her culture - when she and her husband visit her home planet, he has to adjust to how _nobody_ seems to wear anything.
-   Astral in _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_ doesn't wear any clothing apart from earrings (though there's not a lot to hide). Funnily enough, later in the series, we see that most Astral World residents do indeed wear clothes.

    Asian Animation 

-   _Happy Heroes_: Most Adelians (Kalo, Caesar, Arcas) tend not to wear much clothing.

    Comic Books 

DC Comics

-   Babe in the second _Atari Force_ series goes around wearing nothing. Justified as he's from a species that grow into mountains, and his "skin" has the consistency of granite.
-   _Green Lantern_: While the more human shaped lanterns tend to wear clothes, many of the more alien among them like Apros and B'ox do not.
-   Martian Manhunter's true martian form has no clothes, and he merely shapeshifts forms that have clothes.
-   _Teen Titans_:
    -   According to Starfire, Tamaranians don't place much value in clothes (they see nothing inherently unchaste about nudity and they're pretty much Flying Bricks, so Armor Is Useless). This is largely her justification for being both an Innocent Fanservice Girl and Ms. Fanservice.
    -   Miss Martian, much like earth's other Martian hero, is a Technically Naked Shapeshifter whose clothes are just part of her shapeshifted form to be more pleasing to the human eye.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: Rykornians are Hive Mind Plant Aliens that do not wear clothes.
    -   _Comic Cavalcade_: Sharkeeta and her fellow shark mermaids do not wear clothes or jewelry, and their modesty is preserved by their black shark skin extending far enough to cover their chests. This turns out to not be by choice and they resent the Amazons for keeping them isolated from the ocean and treating them like fish rather than women.
    -   Wonder Woman's counterpart in the Tangent Comics continuity (which was built on the premise of reusing familiar names for new characters who had very little in common with their namesakes) is an alien woman whose only clothing consists of armor that doesn't really cover much of her body.

Marvel Comics

-   _Guardians of the Galaxy_ Martinex is a crystalline transhuman from the planet Pluto. His body is composed entirely of crystal, and he never wears clothes.

Other Publishers

-   In _Astro City_, the Jarranathans are pink-skinned humanoid aliens whose only "clothing" are leafy vines that strategically cover any awkward bits.
-   In all of their incarnations, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are seldom seen wearing anything besides their bandanas and weapons, unless it's part of a disguise. Their shell is not of the removable kind.

    Fan Works 

-   Most _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ Human-in-Equestria fanfics feature an inversion, even if it is never mentioned. The (alien) humans almost always wear clothes in a society that only ever wears clothing to formal events, and is otherwise naked 98% of the time.
-   _Plan 7 of 9 from Outer Space_. Captain Proton tries to arrest an alien abductor for murder, kidnapping, reckless endangerment, and public indecency. "Why _do_ non-humanoid aliens go around without clothes anyway?"
-   Actually justified in Peter Watts _The Things,_ a take on _The Thing (1982)_ as told from the alien's POV. To a creature that can shapeshift and adapt to any environment, the idea of clothing is weird and horribly inefficient.
    
    "It feels almost obscene—an offense against Creation itself—to stay stuck in this skin. It's so ill-suited to its environment that it needs to be wrapped in multiple layers of fabric just to stay warm. There are a myriad ways I could optimize it: shorter limbs, better insulation, a lower surface:volume ratio. All these shapes I still have within me, and I dare not use any of them even to keep out the cold. I dare not adapt; in this place, I can only _hide._"
    

    Films — Animation 

-   When Crystal and Amber are revealed to be aliens in _Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders_, their true forms appear to lack clothing.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey_, the Station aliens are always naked, despite having furless skin and minimal body hair.
-   _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_ is another naked hairless alien. Lampshaded:
    
    **Gertie:** Was he wearing any clothes?  
    **Elliott:** No.
    
-   The alien family in _Mac and Me_, until they become American citizens at the end.
-   _Star Wars_
    -   Chewbacca is probably the most well-known example, though he does solve the pocket problem by wearing a Badass Bandolier. He's also covered in enough fur that protection from the elements is a non-issue.
    -   Hutts are always shown undressed, despite a lack of natural protective covering. Hutt hides are thick enough to shrug off blaster fire, though.
-   Mostly averted with _Paul_ from the 2011 comedy. He needs to be naked to turn invisible effectively, but the rest of the time, he wears cargo pants apparently hiding a Gag Penis.
    
    **Paul:** What? This is _small_ where I come from!
    
-   Almost every alien in _Men in Black_, save for the ones with a Mobile-Suit Human.
-   The aliens in _Signs_ wear nothing. This seems rather stupid when it's revealed at the end that water reacts to their skin like acid. So they're purposefully choosing to run around a planet covered in over 70% acid. That'd be like streaking on Venus. This lead to an interesting audience reaction. Though most of the alien tropes were played straight (patterns in crop fields, unexplained lights in the night sky), the monsters weren't _specifically_ stated to be aliens. Mixed with their apparent stupidity, this lead to widely-accepted Fanon that the creatures were actually demons.
-   The alien in _Super 8_. _**If**_ the alien had any garments, it's possible that they were confiscated for analysis by its human captors.
-   The aliens from _Cowboys & Aliens_ only ever wear their gun-bracelets. It helps that most of their skin is Immune to Bullets, though.
-   The movie version of _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ averts the matter of topless centauresses by putting them in (torso-only) armor.

-   Averted in _Independence Day_: What initially looks like naked aliens is later established to be some type of environmental/combat suit. Under the suit they're naked.

    Literature 

-   The nonhumanoid aliens in _Alien In A Small Town_ have no nudity taboo, but do wear functional clothing. The title alien wears a "life support belt" attached to surgical implants which helps him breathe Earth's atmosphere, and a translator device on a strap around his eyestalk.
-   Most of the Transhuman Aliens in _All Tomorrows_ don't wear clothes, with the exception of the Killer Folk and Bug Facers.
-   Pretty much all the aliens in _Animorphs_, except for some Yeerk hosts who wear minimal clothes to depict rank or faction. When Elfangor first met humans he was actually freaked out by Loren taking off her shoe, since he had assumed that was her actual foot. Ax has trouble understanding why he has to wear clothing while morphed as a human, and frequently refers to clothes as "artificial skin" and shoes as "artificial hooves."
-   In the _Discworld_, the troll Detritus is described, in _Moving Pictures_, as naked except for a ragged loincloth that _concealed whatever it was that trolls thought necessary to conceal_. This appears normal for trolls.
    -   _The Colour of Magic_ has Rincewind pulled into a tree's Pocket Dimension by some dryads. Neither the females nor the males wear any clothes, though any sexiness of this fact is offset by the fact that, like most sentient beings, they want to kill him.
-   The _Gaea Trilogy_ by John Varley features a number of different alien species (all created by the titular superintelligent living space habitat) who largely eschew clothing of any kind. Some, like the Angels, have furry coverings protecting their delicate bits. Whereas the Titanides are essentially centaurs and all appear female-looking, including breasts and exposed genitals, both horse-sized and human-sized. Later in the series, a few who have been converted to Christianity by missionaries from Earth are at least wearing clothing when in church. The difficulty of putting pants on a horse-type body is carefully not mentioned.
-   In Rick Griffin's _Hayven Celestia_ universe most sapient species are covered in fur or scales and wear little more than jewelry and tool belts. Unless they're in hazardous environments like open space or the krakun's sulfur-saturated homeworld.
-   Played for Laughs in _Hunting Problem_, a 1950's sci-fi by Robert Sheckley. A shapeshifting Starfish Alien is hunting three humans so he can bring back a Genuine Human Hide. He finally succeeds in capturing them, pulls out a knife and... we cut to the three humans racing away in their spaceship, wondering why some alien would steal their clothes.
-   _John Carter of Mars_: The Martians are confirmed nudists, despite the harsh conditions on Barsoom. Dejah Thoris, in her first appearance, is described in these immortal words: "She was as destitute of clothes as the green Martians who accompanied her; indeed, save for her highly wrought ornaments she was entirely naked, nor could any apparel have enhanced the beauty of her perfect and symmetrical figure."
-   _Known Space_:
    -   Protectors are transformed humans who've lost their gonads and gained enhanced intelligence. They put as much thought into protecting their groins as you do into protecting your armpits, and largely for the same reasons in addition to their skin already having hardened into a kind of biological armor. However, many of them see the value of carrying things, so they wear multi-pocketed vests.
    -   _Ringworld_: Unlike humans or the Ringworld's other species, the Grass Giants have no cultural sense of body shame and wear no clothing or adornments.
-   E. E. "Doc" Smith featured this in both the Lensman and Skylark universes, both with human (or humanoid) extraterrestrials and with definite non-humans (including flying lizards and even more grotesque forms). Whole planets were basically giant nudist colonies in space, with the inhabitants giving no more thought to their unclothed status than to the food they ate. Some races invert the trope.
-   _Lilith's Brood_: The Cthulhumanoid Oankali only wear clothes when they're deliberately trying to put humans at ease. Justified since they have sensory tentacles across their bodies, are tough enough not to need the protection, don't have (or need) genitalia, and come from a Planet Spaceship that maintains a safe environment for them.
-   Lampshaded in one of the _Sector General_ novels, when Dr. Conway muses that he should be able to easily find the Earth Humans among the crowd at the space station's "beach" by the fact that only they would be _wearing_ clothing.
-   Most aliens in _The Ship Who..._ wear clothes, except for Starfish Aliens like the Corviki. Not wearing clothing is one of the reasons why the natives of Angalia, roughly humanoid though they are, were evaluated as non-sapient. They pick up the habit, with Blaize's help, as part of a general effort to be reconsidered as people, as well as doing enough local terraforming to be able to mine and start farms.
-   In C. S. Lewis's _The Space Trilogy_, the King and Queen of Venus in are so attuned to the weather of the planet that they never need clothing. When the protagonist actually meets them in the second book, he's shocked by how little he notices there nudity, comparing it to the innocent nudity of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. It doesn't take long before the protagonist ditches his clothes because that's just what people do on Perelandra.
-   In Turtledove's _World War_ series of books, the Race never wears clothes except for practical items such as bandoliers, pouches, and occasionally body armor. Their idea of proper attire is to cover themselves with body paint. Somewhat justified in that the planets they had visited before were very, very hot, like their home star. For example, the polar regions on Home (the Race's home world) are so frigid by their standards that, at rare times, "frozen water" (snow) has been known to occur. And what's considered "pleasantly hot" by the Race is nearly fatal to Humans. They are utterly unprepared for Earth's far chillier climate, and suffer greatly in their campaigns in the USSR and America during the winter months.
    -   In the follow-up _Colonization_ series, the lack of clothing also causes problems with the Race's subjugation of Muslims, especially once the Colonization Fleet arrives, and females of the Race start to show up (although it's difficult for humans to distinguish Race males from females). One Muslim man asks a couple of Race soldiers (males) why they allow their females (and males too) to walk around naked. After all, aren't their minds constantly busy with thoughts of sex? The soldiers laugh at the notion—the Race only mates during the females' estrus season, and don't think almost at all about mating the rest of the year. The Muslim man proceeds to mention how Allah frowns upon such thoughts, and the soldiers casually mention not caring what some fictional deity thinks. The man looks at them in shock and leaves. Violent riots start soon after.
    -   By The '60s, many younger humans (in warmer regions, at least) have started to wear the bare minimum of clothing, prefering Race-style bodypaint. In fact, some wear nothing at all. By the 21st century, it's common to show nudity on TV, and the most popular show on American TV is a gameshow where the assistant is a hot girl named Rita who wears Minoan-style clothing (i.e. fully-exposed breasts), and many women in the audience are also topless (and not all are covered in bodypaint). At the same time, the host of the show is a human-raised lizard named Donald who puts on bodypaint for the show that makes it look like he's wearing a formal suit.
-   Centaurs in Piers Anthony's _Xanth_ series take pride in being nude, they see it as confirming their superiority to the rest of the world. One side character in one of the books has to take on this attitude after having gone through a transformation in order to be with her Centaur boyfriend, with limited success.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _ALF_ is smart enough to crack wise with the Tanners, but can't be bothered to put on a pair of pants.
    -   Averted in later episodes when he starts wearing clothes.
-   The 2016 _Arrowverse_ crossover event, "Invasion," features the Dominators, who are completely naked, in contrast to their comic counterparts. The producers said they were originally going to wear robes, but found them difficult to animate when they decided to make the aliens entirely CGI.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Sea Devils had to be given string vests at the last minute as someone objected to this issue late into production.
    -   The Slitheen when not in human suits. They even rejoice in their nakedness.
    -   While the Teller walks around in a full-body straightjacket for most of _Time Heist_, he and his mate are released wearing nothing at all.
-   _Stargate SG-1_: The Asgard are highly advanced grey space aliens, but never wear clothes. They quite visibly have no genitalia, since they reproduce through cloning. Lampshaded when both Sheppard and Mitchell first meet them, and their primary concern is wondering if Asgard are _supposed_ to be naked.
    
    **Carter**: What were you expecting?
    
    **Mitchell**: Well... _pants_, for one.
    
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_:
    -   Betazoids usually wear clothes, but they don't have much of a nudity taboo; most famously, their traditional wedding attire is nothing. In "Cost of Living," Deanna is horrified to realize her mother is considering going to her own wedding _clothed._
    -   Technically, Data, during his early years on Omicron Theta. He didn’t see the need for clothes, being an Android who didn’t suffer the elements. His creator had to program in a sense of modesty, since the neighbors objected to a naked “fully functional” humanoid running around.
-   Odo from _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ is ''technically'' naked most of the time, but since he's a shapeshifter it looks like he's wearing clothing and it's never really commented on. Of course, Odo's natural state is a gelatinous blob with no clearly defined organs, much less genitals.
-   Cole in _Tracker_, who had a hard time with clothing, and staying dressed in the beginning, probably related to Cirronians being energy beings.
-   "Grey" aliens in _The X-Files_ have no clothes. Except for the episode "Unnatural", when the Grey is wearing baseball clothing.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Most centaurs are depicted as such, not even bothering to get dressed for their hairless human half.
-   Similarly, mermaids are seldom seen wearing anything aside from maybe a Seashell Bra, yet they can dive into deep, cold ocean depths without any concern for their unprotected skin.

    Pinball 

-   The aliens in _Asteroid Annie and the Aliens_ wear little or no clothing.
-   The mermaids of _Barracora_ are completely naked, with no visible genitals.
-   Similarly, the sea nymphs of _Fathom_ wear nothing more than their sinister smiles.

    Radio 

-   _Journey into Space_: In _Journey to the Moon_ / _Operation Luna_, the Time Travellers do not wear clothes due to their armoured shells.

    Toys 

-   Zig-zagged in _Tamagotchi_. There are plenty of Tamagotchis that don't wear any clothing at all, but also plenty that do wear clothes (the latter type is more common in the modern releases). One of the series mascots, Mametchi, wears a black cap but no shirt or pants, while his friends Memetchi and Kuchipatchi completely lack clothing; Lovelitchi, on the other hand, does wear a shirt.

    Video Games 

-   The character Cosmo from the old MS-DOS game _Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure_.
-   In the indie game _Fez_, Gomez and all the other characters do not wear any clothing. Except for a fez, obviously.
-   Vasudan _fighter pilots_ in _Freespace_ are shown to wear armour-esque flight-suits just like their Terran counterparts, but otherwise every Vasudan shown wears not a speck of clothing. And show nothing.
-   _Halo_:
    -   ZigZagged across the franchise with the Brutes. In _Halo 2_, the Brutes are best described as a race of big, hairy Chewbacca clones, only wearing bandoleers and some tertiary armor pieces, while the Brutes in _Halo 3_ are all decked out elaborate suits of Powered Armor. _Halo: Reach_'s Brutes split the difference by low-ranking grunts go nude while high-ranking commanders wear armor.
        -   The Watsonian explanation for the contrast in the _Halo_ Expanded Universe is that there are two main "meta-clans" of Brutes, with one being more savage and primitive and the other more intelligent and sophisticated. The Doyalist explanation is that _Halo 2_ had a very rocky development, with a large amount of content tweaked or completely removed to meet publisher deadlines while in _Halo 3_ they were given armor to compensate for displacing the Elites as the primary baddies within the Covenant.
    -   Until _Halo 5: Guardians_, the standard Grunt wore a helmet, some chest armor, a methane backpack, and _absolutely nothing else_. In this case, the Grunts are cannon fodder who are not given much in the way of good equipment by their superiors.
-   _I Was a Teenage Exocolonist_: Sym is an Artificial Human made by an alien Wetware Body generator to which clothing is a foreign concept. If it weren't for Dys giving him clothes from the colony behind everyone else's back before the Player Character first properly meets him, Sym would be going around naked. In fact, in a conversation in which the Player Character and Dys exchange information about Sym they suspect each other to be unaware of, Dys spells out that Sym was naked when he first met him.
-   The titular character from the _Kirby_ series only wears hats occasionally. His red "shoes" are actually his exposed feet. Justified since he is only a ball with limbs.
-   Averted by most species in _Mass Effect_, but notably played straight by the hanar. Of course, given that the hanar are a species of floating jellyfish, it's difficult to think of what clothing they could possibly wear in the first place. Especially since they communicate by bioluminescent flashes.
-   In _Spore_, you can create an outfit for your creature in the Tribal, City, and Space stages. You do have the option of not giving them clothing but they will be weaker in Tribal stage. In the City and Space stages, clothing is only aesthetic.
-   _Starcraft_ has the Protoss, who play with this trope a bit. Although they largely appear to be Human Aliens, they are in fact sentient plants/fungi. Thus, they not only lack anything resembling mammalian genitalia (including being a rare subversion of Non-Mammal Mammaries), they also do not feel sexual desire (at least, not in the way humans do). They tend to wear little in the way of clothing, and even their armor has a tendency towards the stripperific. However, the few articles of clothing they do consistently wear are those which would cover genitalia on a human. On the other hand,their apparel choices need no justification.
    -   also in that game, a rare example of this with Human Aliens is Sarah Kerrigan in her Queen of Blades form (and in her final Xel'naga form). Technically, she spends much of _Starcraft 2_ naked: though nothing resembling human genitalia shows (since her body was reassembled and "improved" by Abathur). Though whatever the crazy space slug did, it doesn't seem to put Jim Raynor off (or indeed most of the fans).
-   Only six of the nine standard races seen in Startopia bother with clothing.
    -   Its sequel Spacebase Startopia has several race walk around naked or nearly naked, only doning clothes if they become employed. Other races it is unclear if they are wearing clothes or parts of their bodies look like clothes.
-   While most species in _Stellaris_ wear Space Clothes, some don't, particularly in the Arthropoid group. The game actually keeps track of this, allowing custom insults from nudists to clothes-wearing enemies:
    
    Behold the \[Species 1\] form, glorious and bared for all to admire. Contrast with the paltry \[Species 2\], cowering under their layers of cloth, knowing that the world does not want to see their sad frames.
    
-   _X-COM_: Aliens have a pragmatic sense of style: if they're not wearing armor or a suit essential to their survival, they go nude. The exception is _XCOM: Chimera Squad_, where after the fall of the Ethereals, the more intelligent races<sup>list&nbsp;</sup>  all wear clothing, though Sectoids seem to prefer going barefoot.
-   In _X: Rebirth_, the Lizard Folk Teladi rarely wear anything more concealing than a utility vest and a backpack, showing that they got nothing down there. Averted by their appearances in the older games, where they were often shown wearing armor, shirts, and vests, though they were only ever shown from the shoulders up, and were more anthropomorphic then.

    Web Comics 

-   See the centaurs bit above? In _Accidental Centaurs_, when encountering civilization for the first time, Alex learns at his expense that not covering one's upper half is considered indecent exposure for males too.
-   The Uryuoms from _El Goonish Shive_, being shapeshifters, can simply "delete" their private parts when not in use. However, none are seen naked outside of Imagine Spots, when it's also specified they do have use for clothing.
-   _Harbourmaster_: The Entomorph Insectoid Aliens don't bother wearing clothes over their exoskeletons unless they're placating ignorant human tourists. Ironically, their genitalia are both hidden and nowhere near the region that humans expect to be clothed.
    
    **Gilou:** ...But I doubt that tourist would have accepted it if Twinkletoes had just pulled a sock over the end of her tail.
    
-   Used hilariously in _Irregular Webcomic!_ involving Han Solo and Chewbacca.
-   _Jix_ and other Ambis usually don't wear anything except for occasional battle armor. Leading to several "did you just pull that out of your ass?" comments whenever one draws a gun (canonically they keep things in subspace, just like their extra mass for battle form).
-   All the non-human characters in _Marooned_.
-   Zigzagged for Gwog and his species in _The Petri Dish_. They don't have a nudity taboo but usually wear clothes anyway. Gwog's pet wears only a collar.

    Web Original 

-   According to _Cracked_, this is one of the reasons Aliens have a hard time conquering Earth.
-   _Hamster's Paradise_: The harmsters don't wear clothes covering their entire body because they are covered in fur which does a good enough job at protecting them from the elements. What clothes they do wear tends to be sparser and is either used for things like decoration, denoting status or things like pouches and vests for utility. About the only things they do wear that cover their bodies would be armor.
-   _FTL: Kestrel Adventures_:As in the game many aliens seem fine with walking around naked. Lampshaded in one episode when one of the humans notices a clothed rock man.
-   Most nonhuman species in _The Jenkinsverse_ hail from comfortable, hospitable planets. While clothing is useful for protection and warmth on Death World Earth, elsewhere in the galaxy clothing would have just been unnecessary effort in creating and cleaning it for no real benefit. Most alien species are therefore rarely clothed, except for some packs, bags and holsters in lieu of pockets.
-   _Starsnatcher_: Subverted with the Seizers. They look naked at first, but they're just wearing skintight bodysuits made of nanomaterials that mimic their bodies' natural color. Their suits contain plenty of pockets, and can even protect them from the harsh conditions of exoplanets. The Primogenitors appear to play this trope straight, however, from what little we see of them, as the narration never describes them wearing clothing. Then again, the ones we do see are part of their species' Space Amish.

    Western Animation 

-   Roger from _American Dad!_ was like this in the earlier seasons, before he realized he could go out in public and pass for human with clothes and a wig. His home planet is actually much colder than Earth, so he has no problem with exposure to the elements.
-   _Ben 10_:
    -   Gwen's grandmother in _Ben 10: Alien Force_. Of course, her entire body is luminescent. This actually seems to be the true form of all Anodites.
    -   Most of Ben's alien forms fall under this. Which is why when Rath debuted in _Alien Force_, nobody particularly cared that he didn't wear any clothes. Especially since he's not just an alien, but an alien tiger-man, so one could argue that he has even less reason to wear clothes than any other form (the humanoid ones anyway). Fast forward two whole shows later, and this becomes the ultimate Brick Joke when Ben meets other Apoplexians (Rath's species) for the first time... and they're wearing clothes. When Ben questions them about this, they tell him that of _course_ they wear clothes! Their species has a highly evolved sense of shame, and they're insulted that he even asked such a question! Cue Ben's horrified realization that he's been running around naked as Rath this whole time. In a later episode, it's discovered that a bug in the Omnitrix caused Rath's clothes to not be generated along with him, which promptly gets fixed, giving Rath a Masked Luchador outfit. In the reboot series, he's back to being naked again, but it never gets explained whether or not he's supposed to be that way this time around.
-   Rivesh Mantilax and Seruba Velak, from the _Doctor Who_ animated serial _Dreamland_ are aliens who go without clothing.
-   _Frisky Dingo_: Killface, the Villain Protagonist, doesn't wear any clothes and few people seem to mind. His son Simon _does_ wear clothes, making it all the more bizarre. Played with at the last moment of the series, when Killface's family, dressed royally, comes to Earth on their spaceship. His mother gets mad at his lack of clothes.
-   _Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids_: "Nobby's Nightmare" has Nobby's crush and her family turn out to be naturist aliens.
-   None of the main aliens of _Pet Alien_ wear clothes except for Swanky, who sometimes wears a bathrobe. "Day of the Naked Aliens" revolves around this, with Tommy teaching Dinko that humans wear clothes to hide their "naked stuff"; Dinko freaks out upon realizing he's been naked the whole time, while Gumpers doesn't care and even happily sings about being naked.
-   _Robot Chicken_: Parodied in a _Star Wars_ sketch where Han meets Chewbacca's family and discovers that they all wear clothes, leading for him to realize Chewie's been naked all this time.
-   _Rolling with the Ronks!_: Flash and his rival Rob are aliens who don't wear clothes.
-   All of the _Space Goofs_ go naked, except for Candy, who wears nothing but a half-apron around his waist.
-   The _Transformers_, as a race of living Transforming Mecha, rarely wear clothes... though occasionally they choose to put some on, for whatever reason. When Transformers _do_ wear clothes, they usually need to ditch them to transform anyways, so it may be one of the rare cases where clothing actually _is_ less practical than nudity.
-   _Tripping the Rift_: Chode is always naked. Interestingly other members of his species like his grandfather do use clothes, so go figure.
-   This trope appears amongst several of the various aliens that appear in _Wander over Yonder_, including the main duo, Wander and Sylvia, who only wear accessories that don't really cover anything. Lord Hater, Commander Peepers, and the watchdogs are far more modest though.
