The opposite of Berserk Button where a person does something that makes another person unpleasant, especially if it has bad consequences. Kindness Button is when you do something that a person finds so pleasant that he seems to enjoy it and even praise you for it, which you will obviously like. Or you do something you know the person likes. You give a compliment to the poor depressed girl and she will smile at you, and who knows, she might even go out with you.

Rare cases would be doing something so nice to someone who's a Jerkass which will turn him into a Jerk with a Heart of Gold or even a Nice Guy. Also, apologizing and making amends with others you've wronged might make them calm down and become happy with you can also be examples of this trope (although using a certain thing they like can easily earn you forgiveness). Often people who's afraid of angering someone (especially people with Hair-Trigger Temper) will push that someone's button. Doing so is often also make the presser Easily Forgiven if they're already guilty of something.

In cases where Even Evil Has Standards, reminding a villain of their standards may be enough to get them to reconsider their evil ways, or at least to stop and Pet the Dog. This is especially true if their standard involves a family member (Even Bad Men Love Their Mamas, Even Evil Has Loved Ones, Even Mooks Have Loved Ones) or a soft spot for the vulnerable (Would Not Hurt A Child, Never Hurt an Innocent). On the other hand, a more serious villain may see compassion as a Fatal Flaw that needs to be eradicated because Virtue Is Weakness.

This can invoke the philosophy that Good Feels Good. This can lead the character to be friendly to the other because they were nice to said character. Often related to Morality Pet and Morality Chain where the former is when a character shows kindness to the Jerkass and earns gratitude for it or just mentioning this is enough to soften the tough character up while the latter is about a character being the only reason why he remains on the side of good. It can be Cuteness Proximity if the thing in question is a cute fluffy animal. The non-sexual variant of Instant Seduction.

-   _Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?_: Liliruca "Lili" Arde at first was taking advantage of Bell Cranel's kindness, thinking that he was an naive idiot who didn't realize she was conning him. After she's beaten up and left for death by the members of her own familia, Bell comes back to save her. The fact that he shows to truly care for her causes her to rethink her opinion, even falling in love with him.

    -   In the first season, Azusa quickly realizes that everybody finds it adorable when she wears cat ears, which leads to her putting them on in the hopes of calming the tension when Mio and Ritsu start fighting.

-   In _One Piece_, this happens to Gin when Sanji gives him food for free so he doesn't starve to death.
    -   Similarly with Sanji himself, who is quite a jerk to most other guys, but if they are hungry, he will gladly make them some food, and he will even prepare special food for them if they are picky eaters. This is due to an incident in his past that taught him not to underestimate starvation, so he'll give food to anyone no matter if he likes them or not (but if he doesn't like them, he'll beat them up afterwards).
-   _Rebuild World_: For both Akira and Sheryl who are described as having distorted personalities from growing up in the Wrong Side of the Tracks, hugs are this. For Akira there's also baths.

-   In _Emma_, the eponymous protagonist is very snobbish and frequently complains about the Coles, a trade family that she thinks are putting on airs of gentility without being good at it. She's actually quite looking forward to turning down an invitation to a party they're planning, and is subsequently put out when it seems they aren't going to ask her.

-   In _Shadow of the Conqueror,_ it surprises Lyrah to find Daylen expressing so much guilt for what his "father" did, and her regard for him improves enough that she tells him that he's nothing like Dayless the Conqueror.

-   _Scrubs_: Dr. Kelso has one "good" day (following the only time per year he and his wife have a romantic evening together) where he's actually in a good mood.

Depending on the choices you make, possibly in more ways than one.
    -   Garrus, a Troubled, but Cute soldier who's dealt with tragedy after tragedy in his life gains Undying Loyalty to Commander Shepard if the player chooses to accept his friendship. Again depending on how you play, it can progress much deeper than that if you play as a male or female.
