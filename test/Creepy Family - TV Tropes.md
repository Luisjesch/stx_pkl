These families are not like the others: they range from friendly monsters to real psychopaths, and sometimes friendly psychopaths. Well, families tend to have things in common. Members tend to look, behave and act similarly, whether because of genetics or upbringing, a family normally has traditions, internal rules, shared hobbies and a whole microculture. This is what happens when the family is unusual.

The two most well-known examples are _The Munsters_ and _The Addams Family_. Both sitcoms ran from 1964 to 1966 and shared a basic premise; a family that scared people, and both were not only amazingly successful but also had a strong impact in popular culture. Other than that they had a key difference: the Munsters are monsters acting like humans, the Addamses are (ostensibly) humans acting like monsters.

A case of It Runs in the Family and very often a behavior that identifies The Clan, most of the cases show a Nuclear Family albeit often with cases of Nephewism and, ironically, in most examples they are not Dysfunctional Families. Nonhuman examples often involve a Monster Mash via Random Species Offspring. Sometimes overlaps with Quirky Household, when it's an entire village, it's a case of Halloweentown. Contrast with The Family That Slays Together for the horror version, not to be confused with Creepy Uncle.

The gloomy atmosphere of the family is however disrupted when the third child is born: Alan, a colorful, cheerful, goofy and constantly-smiling little boy.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _The Addams Family_ had a movie in the 1990s known by the same name, _The Addams Family_, that was critically and financially successful, thus producing a sequel, _Addams Family Values_. Both centered on Uncle Fester to some degree, and the children as the secondary plot. The second one wasn't as successful commercially, so a third movie was never made.

    Literature 

-   Ray Bradbury wrote several short stories about the Elliotts, a family of supernatural creatures with special abilities. It comprises all sorts of bizarre creatures: ghosts, never-explicitely-named pale nightly bloodsuckers, a werewolf, a witch able to see through other people's eyes, and Uncle Einar who is a very big man with very big wings.
-   Costa Rican writer Daniel Gonzalez Chaves in his children's novel _Leonor; aventuras fantasticas_ has a creepy family; the Quintrala del Osario, the family of main character Leonor (a pale, thin, scary-looking Goth girl) which includes her father, a greenish incredible tall man; her mother, an attractive, yet eccentric, Gothic-looking woman, and her grandmother, that looks like the classic hag. They also live in a haunted house and her father has a factory of knives. They are all friendly people never-the-less.
-   H. P. Lovecraft was a big fan of this trope, he uses it frequently; the Marsh family in _The Shadow Over Innsmouth_, the Whateley in _The Dunwich Horror_, the Potters in _Witch's Hollow_, etc. Horror in Lovecraft's work was very often related to families and bloodlines.
    -   If we count the Cthulhu Mythos lore, there are entire family trees made of Eldritch Abominations.
-   _The Suicide Shop_ gives us the Tuvache family, the owners of the titular suicide shop (a business family selling the ways to off yourself in an awful dystopian future). All named after famous people who killed themselves, they disdain things such as joy and optimism and encourage in their house and clientele depression, self-hatred and morbidity (resulting in a strange form of abusive parenting played for dark laughs). Mishima is the shop owner who sees death as a business and has a true love for seppuku, while his wife Lucrèce cooks the poisons they sell and uses famous suicides as bedtime stories. Their son Vincent is a severely anorexic Mad Artist with a head wrapped in bandages due to his violent and painful chronic headaches, while their daughter Marilyn is an overweight and depressed teenager constantly wallowing in the sorrow of being ugly, useless and alone. The Tuvaches being the Tuvaches, they see Marilyn as an average teenager and treat Vincent as a fantastic genius. But all will change when the third child, Alan, proves to be a cheerful and merry little boy that tries his hardest to bring laugh and smiles around him.
-   The Pagham-on-Sea series by C. M. Rosens, which includes _The Crows_ and _13th_, has a complex, inbred Half-Human Hybrid Eldritch Abomination family, and focuses on one particular branch of them (the Porters). The family is a cross between an English _The Addams Family_ and _Firefly Trilogy_, with middle-class aspirations. The family members range from Obliviously Evil to I Just Want to Be Normal to fully embracing their monstrous natures. Ricky Porter is an Anti-Villain cannibal who has tendrils coming out of the back of his head and can transform into an eldritch god, and can see the future. Wes Porter is a Millionaire Playboy Anti-Hero who drives people insane because his image can never be captured or remembered, and his absence in people's heads drives them to dark, desperate deeds to try and recall what he looks like; Katy Porter is a teenage girl who transforms into a vengeful devouring god, an example of The Poorly Chosen One and It Sucks to Be the Chosen One. Other family members appear in the main series and its related short stories/novellas, with various roles and mutations.
