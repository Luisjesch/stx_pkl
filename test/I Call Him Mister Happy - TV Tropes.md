Why should army men be the only ones to name their weapons?

Some guys get a kick out of naming their penis. The female equivalent (genitalia or breasts) is rarer, but not unheard of; a woman referring to her own breasts as "the girls" seems to be fairly common. The names themselves vary; sometimes it's their own name with 'Little' in front of it, sometimes it's something meaningful, like a reminder of a particular night, and sometimes it's just plain for fun. In real life, though sharing is rarely done with those capable of caring.

What these examples tend not to mention is why a man would voluntarily use the word 'little' in the description of his penis. It seems to be a form of anthropomorphism, in which the penis is thought of as a person (who, obviously, is littler than the real person who gave the penis its name...Or Is It)?

Arguably, the trope namer is Robin Williams who appears to have introduced the phrase "shaking hands with Mr. Happy" way back in 1979.

See Meet My Good Friends Lefty and Righty for those who name the non-intimate parts of their body. Also see Unusual Euphemism. Compare and contrast The Body Parts That Must Not Be Named, when people avoid the proper words for the bathing suit parts. I Call It "Vera" is when someone gives a personal name to the _other_ kind of weapon.

-   In the Chespirito play "11 & 12", Chespirito's character calls his testicles with those numbers (and the rest of his limbs with other numbers, "1" for the head, for example). He donates one of his testicles to another man who lost his in a traffic accident and one of the big comedic sequences of the play is everybody in the cast tossing an accidental Hurricane of Euphemisms about bad things that are going to happen at different times of the day, with the worst of it for eleven and twelve o’clock.
-   _Me and My Dick_ takes place in a world where people can talk to their genitals, who are personified by actors dressed like dicks and pussies. In the former camp are the protagonist's penis "Dick", Weenie and Big Tallywhacker, and in the latter are Miss Cooter, Flopsy and The Old Snatch.
-   _The Vagina Monologues_ has a monologue about the healing experience of holding a naming ceremony for the female speaker's genitals - renaming it from "Itsy-Bitsy" to "Vulva."

-   One of the guests in Lippa's _The Wild Party_ is quick to correct his hooker Dolores about the proper name for his penis.

    **Dolores:** You gotta give 'em a chance!  
    **Man:** Well, can they write a tune? Can they inspire a nation? Y'know, "c'mon kid, c'mon kid, Alexander's Ragtime Band..." Now there's a great tune for ya. Can they touch Irving?  
    **Dolores:** _\[putting her hand on his crotch\]_ I can touch Irving.  
    **Man:** ...His name's George.

    -   From I looked into the Abyss, and it Winked (Parts 3 - 6), after Josh had a Gender Bender and returned to reality after being ripped out it:
