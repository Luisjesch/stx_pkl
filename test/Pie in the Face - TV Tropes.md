**Mayor:** Sam, I'm going to...  
**Sam:** Hit me with a pie? Well, I suppose even the mayor deserves some fun now and then. Here you go. _\[hands her a pie\]_ What? Waiting for an engraved invitation? Fine. Here you go. This is a direct order. Hit me with a pie.  
**Mayor:** This is a trick, isn't it?

A classic gag, tossing a pie into another person's face. Usually, this is a cream pie to get the proper Covered in Gunge effect. For extra comedy value, the victim might take a taste of the pie and note it's not bad.

This Practical Joke was a staple of silent movie comedies, which came up with most of the variants. Often, a missed throw would result in an Escalating War pie fight. The all-out pie fight is a Forgotten Trope in movies, but still shows up elsewhere. A popular gag with this trope is where someone tempts fate by yelling "Let me have it!".

Real Life celebrities and politicians sometimes have this happen to them as a protest. For example, Anita Bryant and Bill Gates have been pied in public. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

On TV, the pie is often just whipped cream or shaving cream sprayed into a pie pan, which gives a similar effect while being much cheaper than baking up a whole pie just to throw it. Shaving cream is often considered better aesthetically than whipped cream, as unlike whipped cream, shaving foam does not melt under hot studio lights.

The trope is also one of the most common and ancient forms of Slapstick and has been applied universally almost ever since its inception.

See also Edible Ammunition, Food Fight, Food Slap, Food Shove Gag, I Taste Delicious, Produce Pelting, as well as Carrying a Cake (this is one possible, but not inevitable, result of performing that trope badly).

        **Wontkins:** Nah, just give me the pie.  
        _(Wontkins gets pied)_  
        **Wilkins:** Sure you wouldn't like a cup of Wilkins to wash it down?
        
    -   And in another one, he is hit in the face by a strawberry shortcake:
        
        **Wilkins the frog:** Want some Wilkins coffee with your strawberry shortcake?  
        **Wontkins:** Can't say that I do.  
        (_Wontkins gets... er, caked_)

He finds it annoying, but ultimately harmless (especially compared to the Doctor getting shot by a Dalek and forcing a Regeneration), and is willing to let bygones be bygones... even when it happens multiple times in one Loop. To top it off, he's taken to collecting the abandoned pie-shooting bazookas.
-   In _The Guile of the Traveller_ Altair and Minerva make a Quidditch bet where the loser has to pay ten galleons and throw a pie at Dumbledore. Harry then ups the stakes by suggesting that the loser also take a picture of the results and send it to the _Daily Prophet_.

She decides not to go through with it when it turns out to be not only doable but rather sadistic, since it's months of him never being able to show his face without it getting pied. By the endgame, he'd be a broken shell of a man known by everyone as 'Pieser', and Taylor would be thought of as a villain.

    Films — Animation

    **Heimlich:** _\[playing a baby\]_ Baba all gone! Baby wants PIIIIE!  
    **Francis:** _Pie?_ He asked for it. Should I give it to him?  
    **Molt:** Yeah! Give him pie! Give him pie!
    
-   _Care Bears: Journey to Joke-A-Lot_: The pie-in-the-face is one of the funny things that Funshine Bear sings about in the song "Make 'Em Laugh."
    
    **Funshine:** _A pie in your face / A banana in your ear / Pull a chicken from your hat / And make him disappear._

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Laurel and Hardy made money by selling pies to throw in their short film _The Battle of the Century_, which codified this trope.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  For a long time much of the second reel that had the scenes setting up the pie fight (involving a fixed fight and a banana) was lost; however, in June 2015 a collector found a well-preserved full copy of the second reel. The restored film was screened in 2017.
-   _Beach Party_: During the surfers' brawl with the bikers, Ava calls Von Zipper "my hero." Dolores says "That does it" and pies her. The brawl quickly devolves into a pie fight.

Everyone gets pied; villain Hedley Lemarr tries to avoid the carnage by ducking back into a restroom, but someone's waiting for him in there, and Lemarr comes out with his face completely covered by the pie he was hit with.
-   _Bugsy Malone_ is a parody gangster movie with child actors (including a young Jodie Foster) and used pies instead of handguns. It also had "splurge guns", based on the Thompson submachine gun, with drum magazines that allow rapid pie firing. Ironically, in the climax, Bugsy and Blousey are the only characters to come out unscathed beyond the residue of the other missiles.
-   _Carry On Loving_ combines this with a Running Gag: throughout the film, which is about a matrimonial agency, there's a young couple who appear in various scenes just enthusiastically making out with each other. In the climactic Foodfight!, the young woman stops kissing her man long enough to look up and see what's going on and gets a cream pie in the face. She doesn't even wipe it off but goes back to making out again.
-   _Cats & Dogs_: During the opening scene where the Brody family's dog Buddy was chasing a cat, they came across a woman who was baking a pie. The cat jumps on her and knocked her on the floor.

She didn't caught the pie this time and it landed on her face.

-   The "lost scene" from _Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb_ is a massive pie fight in the Pentagon's War Room. Cut for not quite fitting the darkness of the rest of the movie; and because everyone was laughing during the one take they could shoot and they couldn't waste time doing another shoot.

-   A Running Gag in _Go West, Young Lady_. Initially Bill throws her ruined pie at Killer Pete in anger at his destroying her Endangered Soufflé, only to miss and hit Tex in the face just as he was about to grab Pete. Later, she takes a second ruined pie and flings it over her shoulder—blaming it for everything that as gone wrong—only to hit Tex in the face as he comes in to propose (again).
-   _The Great Race_ has one of, if not the, largest pie fights ever. The scene cost 200,000 dollars to shoot over 5 days and required 4,000 pies. Including one that's so big, it can't be thrown; it's a huge multi-layer cake, and two different people get knocked into it at two different times (actually just Jack Lemmon playing two characters).

-   _Killer Klowns from Outer Space_: The Klowns throw _acidic_ pies at a security guard, which reduces him to a pile of bones and whipped cream, ending with one of the Klowns sticking a giant cherry on top. Interesting to note that the pies used were not the traditional pie tin with whipped cream, but actual fruit pies that hit the guy with quite a bit of visible force.
-   One of the earliest recorded pie scenes was a Mack Sennett short in which Mabel Normand is pied, but she does carefully remove her glasses first.
-   _The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob_: Commissioner Andréani receives the cheesecake that was intended for David's Bar Mitzvah in the face, courtesy of Rabbi Samuel.
-   _Monty Python_:
-   In _The Muppet Movie_, there's a variation on this trope — the heroes accidentally crash their car into a billboard for Aunt Amy's Custard Pies, sending the giant custard pie upon it flying right into the windshield of villain Doc Hopper's car.
-   _Nanny McPhee_: At Cedric's wedding, after Mr. Jowls is laughed at by Mr. Wheen after being hit by a cake, he takes a cake and hits Mr. Wheen in the face with it, smearing it all around. Them erupting into laughter a moment later starts a food fight.
-   In _No Kidding_, Matron gets one from Cook as revenge for being called "woman" one too many times.

-   _The Return of Captain Invincible_: Captain Invincible does a rapid fire version of this. In a _gun fight!_
-   _The Shaggy DA_, notable for a cigar punching right through the pie.
-   _Singin' in the Rain_:
    -   Kathy Seldon says "Here's one thing I learned from the movies"—lampshading her use of the trope as she throws a pie angrily at Don Lockwood. However he ducks and it hits Lina Lamont instead—as often happened in previous movies, so this is as much a straight as a subverted version of the trope. This also creates a It Began with a Twist of Fate, because this results in Lamont getting Seldon fired from her catering job, who is then amenable to working with Lockwood, so that they fall in love. Which is exactly what one would expect to happen in a romantic movie, ironically confirming Seldon's remark, and perhaps even an indirect way of Breaking the Fourth Wall, since her remark is made as if she was not in herself in a movie, but the trope plays out in a way which makes sense only if she actually is in a movie (as she is).
    -   Cosmo in his song "Make 'em Laugh":
        
        _You start off by pretending you're a dancer with grace  
        You wiggle 'till they're giggling all over the place  
        And then you get a great big custard pie in the face_

-   The Three Stooges did this numerous times, most notably in the short _In the The Sweet Pie and Pie_.
-   A savory variant occurs in _Valley Girl_ when, at the Valley High junior prom, Julie shoves a platter of guacamole into Tommy's face. This sets off a food fight, which Julie and Randy use as cover to escape the venue.

-   In Stephen Manes' _The Obnoxious Jerks_ four of the Obnoxious Jerks enter the school talent show.

It not only gets Toby addicted to goblin fruit until she finds a hope chest, but also leads to her unconsciously using her Dóchas Sidhe powers to make herself almost human, just so she can get a better high.
-   Robert Bloch puts a nasty spin on this in his short story "Sock Finish".

-   _Vorkosigan Saga_: For a high-tech version of the traditional pie fight, see the butterbug butter battle near the end of _A Civil Campaign_.
-   _Wearing the Cape_ has the Pieman, a thrill-villain who always delivers two pies to his chosen public figures: the first by box and the second a few days later, in public, to the face.

    Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping my load,  
    A pie in the face for being a sleepy bull toad
    
-   Ron Mael gets one on the cover of Sparks' album _In Outer Space_.
-   Steve Aoki does this with a cake at each of his live performances. Fans usually line up in the front row with a "CAKE ME" sign in hand.

    Print Media 

-   The cover of the January 1972 "Is Nothing Sacred?" issue of _National Lampoon_, giving one to Che Guevara.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   A pie in the face is something any aspiring WWE Diva can expect at some point in her career, especially around Thanksgiving. Past victims include Sunny, Mickie James, Ashley Massaro, Michelle McCool, Kelly Kelly, Layla, the Bella Twins, Rosa Mendes, Joy Giovanni, Vickie Guerrero, and Stephanie McMahon. The men also sometimes get it in diva-related segments, as has happened to Big Show and Santino Marella.
-   At the July 4, 2016 edition of Raw, a huge food fight broke out backstage. Kevin Owens thought he’d gotten through unscathed.... until someone (it was never found out who) hit him in the face with a pie.
-   Toni Storm's final feud in WWE involved getting a pie in the face twice by Charlotte Flair on an edition of SmackDown; Toni puts a pie in Charlotte's face as revenge the following week.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Fraggle Rock_: In "Fraggle Wars," the World's Oldest Fraggle explains to Red that they're supposed to hate the Cave Fraggles because they have no sense of humor. He says that they think the best part of getting a pie in the face is cleaning up afterward. Hitting the World's Oldest Fraggle and the Cave's Oldest Fraggle in the face with pies turns out to be the key to preventing a war between the Rock Fraggles and the Cave Fraggles.
-   In the opening for _The Jim Henson Hour_, the Swedish Chef lobs a pie that hits Fozzie Bear in the face.
-   A regular happenstance in _Les Guignols de l'Info_ for French philosopher Bernard-Henry Lévy, following a pair of such incidents in Real Life. There was even a parody of the movie _JFK_, with BHL being pied in the face treated like JFK's assassination.
-   _The Mr. Potato Head Show_: Queenie Sweet Potato loves her sugar cream pies. At one point, she accidentally got some pie slapped onto her face, and when Mr. Potato Head's test audience loved it, he added a segment to his for-Toddlers episode where a large number of pies were thrown in Queenie's face.
-   _The Muppet Show_:
    -   In the Sandy Duncan episode, she gets pied by Behemoth for calling him ugly. (She's _trying_ to say he's beautiful inside.)
    -   Fozzie gets one from a rival comedian bear in one episode, and from Paul Simon in another.
    -   At the end of the Candice Bergen episode, Kermit appears with a "pie for Fozzie Bear" (the culmination of a Running Gag where Fozzie would call there was "\[X\] for Kermit the Frog"). When he pies Fozzie, some of it splatters onto Bergen, and Fozzie says "Look what you did!"
-   _Sesame Street_ during the song "Surprise," with even the viewer getting pied.
-   _Tales of the Tinkerdee_: The supernatural rules of the setting mean that, when a witch takes a custard pie to the face, lightning flashes. When Princess Gwendolinda and Taminella Grinderfall (witchiest witch of them all!) both claim to be the real princess, they pie them both to figure out who the witch is. Just roll with it, folks.

    Roleplay 

-   At the climax of the Ninja arc of _We Are Our Avatars_, the Shredder was defeated with a Boston Cream Cake to the face.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Blood Bowl_, one of the cards you can use to perform a sneak attack on opponents is called "Custard Pie", and it specifically involves this trope. For it, one of the players has snuck a pie into his jersey and throws it at another player. If it hits them, they get knocked down.
-   Shown on the "Humiliation" Consequence card in _Kitsune: Of Foxes and Fools_, not to be confused with the "Humiliated" Trick card which depicts a _plunger_ to the face.
-   _Netrunner_ gives us the ICE card "Pi in the 'Face". We assume the effect is virtual.
-   Hasbro's juvenile game _Pie Face!_ has a mechanical device with an arm that holds a sponge that is covered with household whipped cream to simulate the pie. On his turn, a player places his face in the target area of the device, spins the spinner, and twists the handle that number of times. Much like a slot machine, players never can be sure when the payoff will come. The player then scores points for the number he spun if he doesn't get the pie in the face.
-   In the RPG _Toon_, this is a surefire way to Boggle a character.

    Theatre 

-   _Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl_. The sketch in question was originally written by Cleese and Chapman for a 1968 sketch show, _We Have Ways of Making you Laugh_. (It was of course only one of several recycled sketches the Pythons used on stage, most of the others being from _At Last the 1948 Show_.)

    Theme Parks 

-   Fozzie accidentally pies himself with a remote-controlled one in Disney Theme Parks' _Muppet\*Vision 3D_.

    Toys 

-   The game Pie Face is all about this trope. Players roll a die for the number of times to turn the crank, stick their face through a hole in front of a hand holding a pie, and turn it that number of times. If the pie doesn't get launched in their face, they give another player a turn. Whoever gets hit with the pie loses.

    Video Games 

-   Johnathan from _Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin_ can throw cream pies at enemies. When leveled up it's also one of the most powerful Dark-element weapons in the game, making it the perfect tool to take out superboss Richter Belmont.
-   In _Dead Rising_ there's a few places with pies, which you can eat for one hit point or throw at zombies. Score a direct hit to their face and the pie will stick, leaving them unable to see you. If you attack them and knock off the pie, you can pick it up and throw it again. This is also used as one of Frank West's attacks in _Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3_, where he throws a pie at the opponent's face. It only sticks for a second though.
-   _Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance_ has a Mystery Room in the Item World where a Fight Mistress will ask you if you want to use a pie. Say yes, and she'll use it to pie a Witch in the face (with animations ranging from using a whole stack of pies to one that explodes like a bomb!). Afterwards, the Fight Mistress will give the player a Pie (which counts as a Fist weapon; its Ambusher innocent ensures the target won't counter-attack the wearer).
-   _Dungeon Crawl_:
    -   The 2013 April Fools' Day update briefly added Jester as a playable background; they started with a stack of pies that could either be eaten or thrown at enemies to temporarily blind them.
    -   Later on, the Killer Klowns found in the Realm of Zot were given the ability to throw pies. These do surprisingly heavy damage for confectionery, and also carry one of several nasty effects like Silencing you or making you unable to drink potions.
-   _Dragon Age: Inquisition_: If you agree to play pranks with Sera in the _Trespasser_ DLC, what follows is a _montage_ of the two of you gleefully pieing random people - and then each other. It's a Call-Back to a potential dialogue from the main game, in which Sera assures the Inquisitor that they're not evil enough to deserve any worse treatment than a pie in the face.
-   _Excitebots: Trick Racing_ features floating clown heads on some tracks. If you successfully land a pie on their face, you will be rewarded with three stars and the terrain shifting for a better route.
-   In _Honk!_ clown protagonist Lola has a never-ending stack of pies which is good for a distraction.
-   In _Injustice: Gods Among Us_, The Joker's super move starts by throwing a pie into his opponent's face, allowing him to move in for the rest of the attack (filled with crowbar-smashing and explosions!). In _Injustice 2_, his new Limit Break is instead initiated by lobbing a gas canister at his enemy, but if he's equipped with "Side Order of Pie" gear, it returns to being a pie to the face.
-   _Kingdom of Loathing_ "This is a cream pie, which has been expertly balanced for throwing." Other players can be targeted giving them the 'Hilarious!' effect of 'Pie in the Face'.
-   The only way to defeat the terrifying, monstrous, bloodthirsty Yeti in _King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!_ is to throw a cream pie in its face. This was not one of its best puzzles.
-   _Makai Kingdom_ has these as weapons, though their basic purpose is to heal their targets.
-   _Super Mario Party_: The minigame Pie Hard has two teams of characters throw cream pies at one another, with more continually being restocked on the tables in the back of their respective zones. As the characters get hit, they get more and more of a Covered in Gunge look.
-   In the PC adaptation of _Muppet Treasure Island_, Pops runs a store where he has installed the Anti-Buccaneer Lunch Launcher, a catapult that tosses pies, to keep pirates from raiding his store. Pops pays you one doubloon for each pirate you attack, but takes one doubloon away for each customer you attack. You'll need to earn enough doubloons to buy one of his costumes to be more presentable to Jeeves, the butler of Squire Trelawney.
-   _NetHack_ has a cream pie item, which causes blindness. On the one hand, stealing from shops will result in Keystone Kops showing up to pie you and beat you with rubber hoses until you die. On the other hand, pieing something does not count as an attack, and the pie takes up the weapon slot, which makes it very useful for characters attempting pacifist conduct.
-   _Pet Society_ had a mystery box that could either give your virtual pet some random cool item or an apple cake to eat, or the cake ended up in the pet's face. The pet would laugh at the incident.
-   _Power Pete_: The clowns in the Magic Funhouse department are fond of doing this. Luckily, Pete can get them right back with the exact same weapon.
-   _Rugrats: Royal Ransom_: This is how the clown enemies attack you.
-   Peacock from _Skullgirls_ has a pie in the face as one of her attacks, which fits into her repertoire of slapstick moves and cartoon references.
-   One of the scenarios in _The Three Stooges_ video game is based on the _The Sweet Pie and Pie_ short mentioned above. To get the best score in this scenario, you have to throw all your pies, and avoid getting hit by pies thrown by the opponents. Like all the scenarios, it gets harder each time you redo it, with more pies required and the opponents becoming faster, but the payoff becoming greater.
-   The Pie Throw is a whole gag (weapon) track in the MMORPG _Toontown Online_. You start by throwing slices, then bigger pies, and then you start throwing _cakes_ at your enemies.
    -   The boss battle against the VP features this heavily in a real-time combat form, where you first throw a pie into a compartment in his body to stun him and then knock him back with more pies in the face until he reaches the edge of the arena and falls.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ Tag Force Games:
    -   In the ones with the GX cast at least, you can play a Dodgeball-esque minigame. One of the things you can throw is a Pie. It disables whoever is hit by it for a couple of turns.
    -   Also in the Third Tag Force Game there's a sandwich throwing minigame. One of the things that needs to be avoided is Pie.
-   _Twisted Wonderland_: The Union Birthday/Birthday Jacket card sets always end with the birthday boy receiving the 'gift of good fortune' from whoever was summoned by the Magical Birthday Dice, which turns out to be this.

    Web Animation 

-   This is how Discord scores first blood in his _DEATH BATTLE!_ against Bill Cipher.
    
    **Discord's Letter:** _(telepathically voiced)_ Dear Princess Celestia, _(summons chef's clothes and a flaming cream pie)_ today, Bill Cipher learned an important lesson... about friendship.  
    **Bill Cipher:** _(almost throws up from his eye)_ Ugh, GAG! _(troped, eye and left hand destroyed)_ OW! MY EYE!!
    
-   _The Most Epic Story Ever Told in All of Human History_: In “The Most Epically Inspirational Sports Movie Ever”, after Ridiculously Epic’s failed attempt at cheating in the skateboarding competition causes him to fall off of the platform, his face lands in a pie.
-   In the _RWBY_ episode "Best Day Ever," Weiss gets one in her own face compliments of Nora. Cue a massive food fight between RWBY and JNPR after that.

    Webcomics 

-   The humorous comic _Epic Battle_ makes pie fights Serious Business.
-   _Ennui GO!_: Frequently done by Sarah as a mood lightener, and usually referred to as "creampies" with tongue firmly in cheek. The joke is taken to the extreme in one strip where Sarah jumps on Izzy and hits her in the face with a pie she's holding between her thighs.
-   _Freefall_ blatantly foreshadows it starting one strip. It only takes a few strips before the pies fly.
-   It took more than a few tries for him to get it right, but _Girl Genius_ has a minor Spark who's developed a special pie that calms people down when he tosses it in their face.
    
    "_Yes!_ Extra butter! _Less nutmeg! **I'm a genius!**_ Ha! Take _that_, Brillat-Savarin!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> "
    
-   This EGS:NP strip in _El Goonish Shive_ features pies that, when thrown in a person's face, transform that person and their clothes.
-   Happens a few times in _Homestuck_, mostly from Nanna, who loves to play tricks on people, even her own grandson and her Alternate Universe self.
-   In _The Order of the Stick_, Xykon is bribed into paying attention to a strategic discussion with Redcloak by the prospect of seeing one hobgoblin throw a pie in another one's face.
    
    **Xykon:** Eh, seems kind of tame...  
    **Redcloak:** _(sotto voice)_ They don't know that I infested the pie with acid-spitting beetles.  
    **Xykon:** Let's talk tactics.
    
-   At the end of _Ozy and Millie_, Millie's father starts a pie fight during the wedding of Ozy's father and Millie's mother. Strangely, this is a sign that he _approves_ of the match (Food fights are a traditional part of dragon weddings. This is why they had so many pies lying around in the first place).
-   _Pacificators_: Aphrodite did this to Muneca.
-   In this _PvP_ strip, fantasy LARP plus Civil War re-enactors plus Klingon LARP plus a broken-down catering truck equaled one rather bizarre pie-fight.
-   In _Rusty and Co._, Mimic gets one from a bugbear channeling Fozzie Bear. And who doesn't know when to stop.
-   In _Scary Go Round_ Hugo gets hit in the face with an apple pie. It's so hot (one molecule away from magma!) that it grievously injures him, forcing him to drop out of the election.
-   _Schlock Mercenary_ opined that "a spontaneous celebration is really only one short hop away from being a riot." Then the chef made some pie.
    
    **Kevyn:** That could have been worse. I could have chosen that moment to issue new weapons.  
    **Tagon:** I think I have pie crust in my spleen...
    
-   _Sheldon_: This strip has Dante throwing a mud pie in Arthur's face.
-   UltraCar in _Shortpacked!_. It started out here and remains her (she body-swapped to a Robot Girl, long story) weapon of choice for humiliating meat-sacks.
-   _Sluggy Freelance_ played with the cream pie to the face in one strip.
-   _The Whiteboard_:

    Real Life 

-   The University of Victoria's Engineering Students' Society has an annual fundraiser on March 14, Pi Day (3.14 - get it?) One person makes a donation to have an individual of their choice pied; the victim can dodge the pastry by matching the donation. Some good-natured individuals allow themselves to be pied but donate as well.
-   Same with University of Calgary's own ESS. _**Oh, Crap!.**_ This would be a Berserk Button had it happened outside of Engineering or if an informal restraining order was never made.
-   The Biotic Baking Brigade, a San Francisco-based left-wing activist group, specializes in throwing pies in the faces of those it regards as its political foes.
    -   Former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien was once pied by a member of this group. (It also happened to Stephane Dion, one of his key ministers; the difference is that Dion launched a lawsuit against them.)
    -   As mentioned at the top of this page, Bill Gates suffered a similar fate on a trip to Belgium.
-   Indeed The Other Wiki has a page devoted to people who have been "pied" at some point. It goes so far as to note, "This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it."
-   And then there are the organizations that are dedicated to pieing people. Like these people. Or this guy.
-   The King of Sweden was attacked by a Strawberry Tart in 2005 by a 16-year-old boy. The King was reportedly "Surprised, but unhurt". In a hilarious case of Over-reaction _and_ Easily Forgiven, the Court then charged the boy with Lèse-majesté and Treason only to then sentence the boy with six months' probation. One assumes they wanted to put the fear of God into him.
-   In recent years, it's become common for a professional baseball player who gets a game-winning hit to be rewarded with a shaving-cream pie to the face from his teammates. Actually, it can apply to any player who does particularly well during a game, i.e. a pitcher who throws a no-hitter.
-   _Skippy's List_ references one particular incident where pies, to be thrown at the unit CO, would be auctioned off for a charity fundraiser. The pies, however, would be "voluntarily" bought by individual soldiers. So Skippy, being The Loonie that he is, decides that a traditional cream pie would be too blasé, and goes with something a little nontraditional...
-   In the 70s, science fiction critic Charles Platt pied magazine editor Ted White in the face at a convention. Sadly, White didn't see the funny side.
-   The infamous anti-gay activitist, Anita Bryant, famously got a banana-cream pie smashed in her face by gay-rights activist, Tom Higgins, during a press conference on October 14, 1977. When Bryant's granddaughter publicly came out as gay in 2021, many media outlets were quick to joke that this was another pie in the face for her, albeit a figurative one this time.
-   Since 2010, the Furry Fandom convention _Rainfurrest_ has featured the tradition of pieing staff members in the face if their charitable donation goals are reached.
-   The first time Fred Rogers ever turned on a television, he saw footage of people throwing pies in each other's faces. The violence disgusted him enough that he decided to devote his life to gentler television programming. Pies in the face are directly responsible for _Mister Rogers' Neighborhood_.
-   A variant of this has been carried out in New Zealand with lamington cakes — twice.
-   Per Rule 34, it is also a niche sexual fetish.
-   The Belgian writer and anarchist Noel Godin specialises in pieing public figures who he thinks deserve it. After pieing Bill Gates, he supposedly said "My work is done here." Another target was Jean-Luc Godard, who found it Actually Pretty Funny, and a recurring target is French philosopher, socialite and TV windbag Bernard-Henri Lévy, who really, really doesn't find it funny at all (which is one of the reasons why Godin keeps doing it.)
-   An activist once threw a pie at anti-feminist Phyllis Schlafly, injuring her eye in the process.
-   In May 2017, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce was pied in the middle of speaking a business conference, by a local Christian farmer who was protesting Joyce's support for marriage equality.
-   As a variant, it's not that uncommon for newlyweds to shove wedding cake in each other's faces and the like. As they generally agree to it beforehand, it's not considered assault or the like. Although there have been cases where it was _not_ agreed on beforehand, and some marriages have ended there and then.
-   Emma Thompson seems rather fond of doing this. At one point, she even said "You can't imagine what satisfaction can be gotten from throwing a pie into someone's face."
