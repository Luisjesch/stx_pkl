_"There's just one problem... **You're talking to the wrong Harvey.**"_

A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.

Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities "switch", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.

Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.

The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a "good" personality, and a "bad" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The "good" personality may have trouble controlling the "bad" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the "good" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If they’re lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.

Compare and contrast with Double Consciousness, Mind Hive, Sharing a Body, Two Beings, One Body, and Talking to Themself. May overlap with Identity Amnesia. Also compare Many Spirits Inside of One, where a person is possessed by multiple independent spirits; and Napoleon Delusion, where a person falsely believes their body is inhabited by the spirit of a famous figure. When this happens to a superhero, it's often a Superpowered Evil Side. Shapeshifting is sometimes involved. If the personalities go back and forth, Flip Personality ensues.

If the two personalities are aware of each other, expect a Gollum Made Me Do It situation to develop. Resolving it may require the weaker of the two to say "I'm Not Afraid of You!" If the Split Personality gets its own body it becomes either a Literal Split Personality or Enemy Without (if said personality is antagonistic or evil). See also Heroic Safe Mode for one explanation as to how a side like this can be created.

    Films — Animated 

-   _The LEGO Movie_: As a spoof of the Good Cop/Bad Cop routine, the film has a police character who changes between a Nice Guy persona and a tough guy persona by rotating his head, with the creative name of "Good Cop/Bad Cop".

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Adaptation._, Donald Kaufman writes a script titled _The Three_, in which the serial killer, the cop chasing him, and the victim the cop falls in love with are all the same person. His brother Charlie points out how idiotic and filled with Fridge Logic the film is.
-   _Black Swan_ is clearly meant to make the viewer think this is going on, but it ultimately leaves it ambiguous as to whether Nina has a split personality or not; the case could be made either way.
-   _Crime Doctor's Man Hunt_: Irene Cotter was completely dominated by her sister Natalie. When Natalie left home, Irene was completely lost and could only cope by pretending to be Natalie. Eventually it reached the point where she completely became Natalie whenever she assumed the identity, and it was as Natalie she committed the murders.
-   _The Dark Crystal_ pushes the Jekyll & Hyde trope to extremes when the urSkeks, in an attempt to purge all evil from their nature, split themselves into the very, very good (but largely helpless) Mystics and the evil and proactively murderous Skeksis. They get better.
-   Surprisingly averted with Two-Face in _The Dark Knight_. Several other diagnoses can surely be made. For one, he still likes to make simple moral decisions based on a coin flip, and acts... should we say, chaotically. He uses the coin when deciding the fates of the people he holds responsible for everything that happened to him in the last day or so. He's on a revenge spree, using the coin to illustrate the arbitrariness of it all.
-   The British horror movie _Dead of Night_ has one story about a ventriloquist, Maxwell Frere (Michael Redgrave), who believes that his dummy, Hugo, is alive and wants to leave him for another ventriloquist. The truth is open to interpretation, but Redgrave's performance strongly implies that Hugo is Maxwell's split personality, as there are shots where Maxwell's lips are moving even when it's "Hugo" who is talking.
-   _Fight Club_ features the unnamed narrator being manipulated by Tyler Durden to create the title club and destroy buildings, and he's eventually revealed to be this.
-   The Twist Ending of _Dressed to Kill_ reveals that Dr. Elliott inhabits an alter-ego, the murderous transsexual Bobbi.

-   One of the protagonists in the Russian comedy _Gun with a Silencer_ "becomes" a woman between midnight and noon. One hilarious scene involves "her" being examined by a gynecologist, who takes one look at the plumbing, drinks a shot of vodka, and says "she's healthy".

-   In _Hide and Seek_, David tries to figure out who his daughter's imaginary friend, Charlie, is. The Reveal shows that David is Charlie, and Charlie was the one who murdered his wife.
-   _Identity_ has a plot twist revealing that the characters are all split personalities in a Battle in the Center of the Mind.
-   Gollum and Sméagol ("Stinker" and "Slinker") from Peter Jackson's _The Lord of the Rings_ live-action movies. The two personalities frequently carry on conversations, to the point that they're practically two minds consciously coexisting simultaneously in the same head. This split-personality theme is less pronounced in the earlier animated movies and the original books, but still present. See entry under Gollum Made Me Do It.
-   Brazilian movie _Loucas Pra Casar_ has Maria Lúcia, a woman with long-lasting marriage obsession, finding out her boyfriend has two lovers, exotic dancer Lúcia and overtly religious younger woman Maria. Then at the altar she finds out all three were her - Maria Lúcia and her partner liked to act out sexual fantasies, but she became Lost in Character.
-   _The Machinist_, which is _sort of_ a deconstruction of both _Fight Club_ and _Crime and Punishment_, explores the psychological side of this and the kind of trauma that can cause it.

-   The Farrelly Brothers' movie _Me, Myself & Irene_ is about a mild-mannered cop who is routinely abused, leading him to eventually flip out and become a jerk.
-   _Mr. Brooks_ is a deconstruction of this trope. Earl, the protagonist, is a respected and wealthy industrialist who is haunted by a man named Marshall who urges him to murder couples in their own homes. But Earl is clearly conscious that "Marshall" is merely the projection of his own killer instincts.
-   Axel Palmer, the killer in the original _My Bloody Valentine_.
-   Tom Hanniger, the real killer in _My Bloody Valentine 3D_.
-   In the movie _Peacock_, the painfully shy John (Cillian Murphy) has a more confident personality named Emma who makes him breakfast and lays out his clothes every day, like a wife would — which is precisely what everyone thinks she is when she is accidentally discovered. The personalities are aware of one another, but they have no memory of the other's experiences. John gets increasingly panicked as Emma begins to 'control' him more, and Emma eventually 'murders' John by staging his death and presenting as Emma only.
-   In the movie _Primal Fear_, the shy and gentle Aaron, on trial for killing the archbishop, is revealed to have a split personality named Roy who is much more outspoken and aggressive and did in fact kill the clergyman. At the end, we find out that Aaron doesn't actually have a split personality; the more disturbing truth is that _Roy_ created _Aaron_ and has been hiding behind the fake personality for years.

-   In _Psycho Beach Party_ you learn very early on that Chicklet has at least two other personalities.
-   Carter in _Raising Cain_ has several, including the amoral Cain and his "fall guy" Josh.
-   Played for laughs in _Serenity_ where Simon briefly suspects that the mysterious "Miranda" could be an alternate personality of River (as it turns out, Miranda isn't a person at all). A couple of seconds after he raises the possibility, both of them burst out laughing at how ridiculous and cliched it would be.
-   _Split_ concerns a man with 23 different personalities, three of which are conspiring to summon a 24th.
-   _Sybil_, based on the 'true story' of Shirley Ardell Mason.
-   _The Three Faces of Eve_ is about a timid housewife named Eve White who learns that her splitting headaches and blackouts are the result of having developed a wilder and more free-spirited personality named Eve Black. A more neutral third personality who calls herself just "Jane" eventually emerges too. The film ends with Jane becoming the dominant and sole personality.
    -   After this film was released, the number of Americans diagnosed with MPD/DID increased quite dramatically; this rash of copycats causes part of the skepticism surrounding the disorder's existence. Both book and film were _extremely_ inaccurate to the real Chris Costner-Sizemore's situation. She later wrote two of her own books and went on lecture tours to explain that a) she had really been multiple, but b) her doctors, sensing a money-making book and film opportunity, distorted and exaggerated her story.
-   By Nick's choosing in _Youth in Revolt_.

    Music 

-   On Maeror Tri's _Multiple Personality Disorder_, each track corresponds to the function/role each personality tends to assume, based on now-outdated psychological theories about the condition:
    
    1\. The Administrator
    
    2\. The Anaesthetizer
    
    3\. The Revenger
    
    4\. The Protector
    
-   SHeDAISY's song "Lucky 4 You" uses multiple personalities in an almost comedic sense.
    
    "Number 5 just cries a river a minute,
    
    7 wants to tie you up and drown you in it,
    
    14 just wants to say so long, bygones,
    
    32 wants to do things to you that'll make you blush,
    
    10 would key that El Camino that you love so much,
    
    And there ain't nobody wants to mess with 23.
    
    Yeah, lucky 4 you, tonight I'm just me."
    
-   Cage 9's song "My Doppelganger" (a.k.a. "Doble Opuesto") is about a guy who hurts his girlfriend (and possibly other people) via his other half, and apparently doesn't seem to understand it's himself until later in the song.
-   In the early years of his career, Eminem presented himself as having a split personality between Marshall Mathers, the serious, insightful rapper, and Slim Shady, the thuggish rapper with a dark sense of humor. He has occasionally revisited this concept later on, notably in the video for "Monster".
-   The Vocaloid song Ten-Faced is about a shy girl who develops no less than ten different personalities, none of whom share memories or realize the others exist. They all end up falling in love with the same guy, who only wants to date one girl. Hilarity Ensues. They deal with the problem in the end by performing a Split-Personality Merge.
-   In The Megas song "GeminEye", Gemini Man is shown as having two personalities who initially don't realize their connection to each other: Gemini, a fearful man with a hired killer after him, and GeminEye, a tough Private Detective that he hires to protect him.
-   Genesis: _The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway_ is a Rock Opera notorious for its impenetrable surrealness and conflicting interpretations by the band's own members. One of them, brought up by drummer and future frontman Phil Collins, claims that the album is about dissociative identity disorder. This is exemplified by the myriad of dichotomies in Rael's life (Rael vs. John, masculinity vs. femininity, trust vs. distrust, etc.) and the convergence of them all at the album's end (at the time, merging was the go-to treatment for dissociative identity disorder).

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Mick Foley had three alters: sadistic Cactus Jack, psychotic Mankind, and Chick Magnet Dude Love.
-   Rather than pretend Shannon/The Governor and Daffney were different people, TNA presented them as split personalities. Presumably this means Lucy, Draculetta and Shark Girl are also split personalities of Daffney.
-   Will White/Bill Black, seen in Fringe Pro Wrestling. Each one is convinced that they are the only one that exists and doesn't know about the other but Will White claims to hear voices and Bill Black talks to himself.
-   Kane seems to have developed a split personality. The helpful and somewhat dorky guy in a suit: Corporate Kane and the vicious fire-wielding Demon Kane. Corporate Kane seems to have no idea about Demon Kane.
-   There's Abyss from Impact Wrestling. Abyss is a crazy monster, sort of a mix between Kane and Mankind. Joseph Park is a fat, goofy lawyer. For a while, they were said to be brothers (obviously you never saw them in the same room at the same time), but eventually TNA booked it so that Park snaps and "turns into" Abyss when he gets mad.

    Roleplay 

-   _Destroy the Godmodder_ has lots of these. It's become a running gag.
    -   Then the GM came down with a bad case of this.
    -   Some of the players mess with this by having other characters try to take over their posts.
-   Kaleigh Jones from v1 of _Survival of the Fittest_ had two, in the form of child-like "Carly" and nymphomaniac "Freya". Bizarrely, Kaleigh seemed capable of deciding which of her personalities was in control and when.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Call of Cthulhu_ supplement _The Asylum and Other Tales_, adventure "The Madman". An investigator is driven insane by exposure to the Cthulhu Mythos and develops an evil alternate personality.
-   In _Champions_, you can purchase the Multiform power as a "partial multiform", just making mental changes. However, since dissociative identity disorder tends to be more subtle, the game recommends representing it by purchasing the differing powers/stat changes with the limitation that they can only be used when one personality is in charge (this will tend to be a lot cheaper).
-   In _Dungeons & Dragons_, the Demon Lord Demogorgon has two heads, but it wasn't until the 3rd Edition that a source mentioned that each had a separate personality. The personality of his left head is named Aameul, the right is named Hethradiah. His two personalities rarely cooperate, and are often fierce rivals. Aameul favors deception, while Hethradiah favors destruction. Strangely, this war within himself often turns out in Demogorgonï¿½s favor. For example, one legend tells how Hethradiah formed an alliance with a powerful lich queen, which left her vulnerable to assassins sent by Aameul. When they killed her, Demogorgon gained her power and lands, so both sides of him benefited.
-   _Eclipse Phase_, unsurprisingly given the ubiquity of Brain Uploading, has multiple ways this can happen:
    -   Split Personality is a mental disorder that can result from events like a botched fork merge or infection with an alien nanovirus.
    -   Multiple Personalities bioware surgically partitions the brain so it can host an additional Ego, often a fork of the main Ego or a friend of theirs. The Egoes can swap off on control of the body and both have full access to the morph's brain implants so one can fight while the other hacks, for instance.
    -   A Ghostrider Module is an implant that can run an Infomorph, they can't take control of the body unless it has a Puppet Sock implant but they can remotely control drones.
    -   The Fenrir is a tank-sized Synthmorph that needs to host six Egoes sharing control to work at full capability.
-   _GURPS_: A character may be created with multiple personalities. Depending on the "point value" of each personality (they may have different abilities), this can actually count as an advantage! The trigger is a roll against IQ in a "stressful situation"; fail the roll and switch personalities. (If you have more than two, the new one is chosen at random.)
-   One of the narrators in the _Hunter: The Reckoning_ Wayward creedbook is Kirsty McCallum, a woman who'd previously had multiple personalities and integrated them; when she was imbued, she split again, her alternate taking the full force of the Wayward imbuing, seeking the elimination of all supernaturals by any means necessary.
-   The premise of New World of Darkness fangame _Janus: The Persona_ is this combined with Superpowered Evil Side.
-   _Orpheus_: One of the Flatliners is Jeffrey Rose, a serial killer with no less than seven other personalities, and each one of them a serial killer in their own right. Making matters more complicated, after Rose's death, his ghostly form develops yet another personality, though at least this one is dedicated to killing Spectres.
-   _Planescape_: The elvish spy Farrow has 15 personalities — each a devout member of a different one of the setting's cutthroat factions.
-   In the _Ravenloft_ campaign, there is Malken, the Darklord of Nova Vaasa. His original personality is Sir Tristen Hiregaard, a nobleman who is _not_ actually evil (listed as Lawful Neutral on his character sheet) and actually perceived as benevolent by some people (it depends on who you ask). However, a dark curse transforms him into a brutal killer called Malken whose victims are often the people Hiregaard himself cares about. No-one in Nova Vaasa save for Hiregaard truly knows Malken's identity; he himself had been unaware for the longest time, believing that he'd managed to keep the curse under control by ordering his servants to lock him in his rooms when he felt its onset, but Malken typically escaped.
-   _Shadowrun_ 5th Edition sees the introduction of "Cognitive Fragmentation Disorder," a nanovirus infection which overwrites the mind of the host with that of its own. Over the course of the disease, victims are subject to expressing one, two, or as many as _twelve_ different personalities as different personality "strains" fight for dominance.
    -   Personasoft/Personafix software have also been a thing since 1st Edition, being software that essentially overrides the mind and personality of the person inside with an artificially created one when they're slotted through a simsense module or datajack. Benign variants crafted for the consumer can allow people to voyeristically 'ride' with a new personality different from their own, while other variants (commonly used on unwilling subjects) entirely subsume the original. In the worst cases, the latter may malfunction during operation, often with horrific consequences given who are commonly slotted with them.
-   This tends to be a common Derangement for members of Clan Malkavian in _Vampire: The Masquerade_. In addition to the _Bloodlines_ example below, the Chicago setting has Evan Klein, who has several personalities, none of which are aware of one another, and some of which aren't even aware he's a vampire.
-   This is actively cultivated by the Eldar of _Warhammer 40,000_. An undisciplined Eldar mind is capable of terrifying extremes — the species spawned a Chaos God during the depravity of the Eldar golden age — so they develop different personae for wartime and peacetime to ensure that they don't lose themselves in bloodlust. They don't always succeed, and Eldar who become trapped on the Path of the Warrior will lose their old identities and take up the name and armor of an Exarch who came before them.
-   In _Wraith: The Oblivion_ most wraiths and Spectres are split personalities, splitting post-mortem into the Psyche, reflecting their consciousness in life, and the Shadow, reflecting their self-destructive traits. Wraiths have the Psyche as the dominant personality, while Spectres have the Shadow instead.

    Visual Novels 

-   Miku in _A Profile_ claims this, but Kaine claims it's incredibly unlikely because not only is DID extremely rare, but her behavior simply doesn't match up to what it should be because the claimed personalities are aware of each other, which defeats the whole point. He's mostly right, but not entirely.
-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   Ben and Trilo seem to have something similar to Batman's Ventriloquist, in that Ben's doll Trilo acts as if it has a mind of its own and routinely beats up its owner. Trilo also seems to forget he's a doll at times - at one point, he tries to get Ben to sing with him in a round.
    -   In _Spirit of Justice_, Uendo Toneido has four of them. The "main three" include Uendo the fairly average rakugo performer, Patches the happy-go-lucky jester, and Kisegawa the stern female courtesan. These three personalities are all conscious at the same time, and decide which one will take over based on which is most appropriate for the situation. The existence of a fourth personality named Owen which takes over when the other three are unconscious is eventually revealed, and briefly suspected of being the case's killer. This is very quickly disproven, however, upon the reveal that Owen is a timid 5-year old boy. It's implied that Owen is the "core" (original) personality the others split from. While simplified, this is a fairly realistic depiction of Dissociative Identity Disorder, down to one of the alters being significantly younger than the others (a "little" in psychology parlance).
-   In _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_, Genocide Jack is an infamous Serial Killer and the Ultimate Murderous Fiend. Jack is the split personality of Toko Fukawa, who was developed to help Toko cope with her traumatic childhood. Despite killing boys she thinks are cute, Jack doesn't actually kill anybody during the course of the game, despite being a suspect twice. Jack says that it's because she'd have to be pretty stupid to kill anyone in the Deadly Game, since she would be found guilty immediately if she used her Calling Cards. The two switch when the active personality either goes unconscious or sneezes. They share general knowledge, but not memories. Toko is gloomy and anxious, while Jack is a gleefully sadistic Large Ham. Toko absolutely hates Jack, and living in the same body as her causes her a great deal of guilt and stress.
    -   In _Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls_, the two of them learn to live a little more harmoniously, thanks to Toko using a taser to switch at will. Jack retains her Pragmatic Villainy in that she's sworn to not kill anyone else, because that would mean that she wouldn't get to see her "master" Byakuya Togami anymore, the one man she's met that she doesn't want to kill. In addition, Toko and Jack's relationship is expanded to say that the two of them also share emotions as well as knowledge (though they still don't retain the other's memory). It's how Toko and Jack can both obsess over Byakuya, and how Toko's growing friendship with Komaru Naegi also transfers over to Jack.
-   Mitsuki/Shiho in _Double Cast_, with Shiho being her regular personality and Mitsuki being her yandere personality. The latter personality was created due to the trauma of Shiho seeing her sister(who was also named Mitsuki)'s body and her love/hate relationship with her.
-   _Extra Case: My Girlfriend's Secrets_: The original game upon release refers to "Seira" as a form of Dissociative Identity Disorder, who manifested due to Sally's belief that she doesn't deserve love. The 1.1.0 update changes the doctor's report to be more ambiguous about her true nature and refers to her as a "Shadow" manifestation of Sally's self-hatred.
-   Averted in _The Fruit of Grisaia_, this is suspected of Michiru, however she actually shares her body with the consciousness of the girl whose heart donation she received. At the start of the story, Other!Michiru only comes out when Michiru needs help while Michiru is left with no memory of it happening, but by the end they've learned to cohabitate.
-   In _Mystic Messenger_'s Another Story, Unknown/Saeran is depicted as having a split personality. The implication is that unlike in the normal story where he doesn't have a split personality and is just Brainwashed and Crazy, Another Story takes place a couple of years earlier when the brainwashing hadn't completely wiped out his original kinder self (Ray) yet who can still keep his more psychotic personality somewhat in check.
-   In _Remember11: The Age of Infinity_, Keiko Inubushi suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder (or so we're told), resulting in her being sent to the SPHIA psychiatric hospital when one of her personalities commits several murders. Later, protagonists Kokoro and Satoru allow their companions to believe this about them (They are actually undergoing a series of Freaky Friday Flips, but find that its easier to convince their companions "I have two personalities", rather than "My mind randomly switches with somebody else's"). The novel even touches upon the legal implications for DID which allowed Keiko to be considered criminally insane much to the anger of family members of her victims.
-   _Shall We Date?: Ninja Shadow_ has Kagura and his "other self", Homura, who was "born" from Kagura being the Sole Survivor of a ninja squad that failed a mission in the worst way possible. They're a Sensitive Guy and Manly Man duo in one body: Kagura is quiet and gentle plus very sweet to everyone and one Hell of a Super Stoic Shop Keeper, while Homura is a brutal Blood Knight who considers Kagura as his Only Friend and is completely devoted to him.
-   Lisianthus of _SHUFFLE!_ absorbed the soul of her unborn sister while still in the womb. The two take turns being the dominant personality. In the original visual novel she has no name but is known as Reverse Sia. Giving her the name Kikyo becomes a plot point.
-   In _Sunrider Liberation Day_, Asaga develops one as a by-product of overusing her Super Mode. While Asaga herself is a cheerful Genki Girl and self-styled Hero of Justice, the new personality is a merciless Knight Templar fixated on meting out “justice” to the entire galaxy and will push Asaga to kill anyone it considers to be evil. The new personality only has control when Asaga uses her powers, but both personalities are aware of each other and actually hold a conversation at one point.
-   Tohno/Nanaya Shiki from _Tsukihime_, with a twist: _neither_ of them is the original. His main Tohno identity was added after "the incident" via brainwashing, which also 'killed' the original, but it remains as his main identity even after he finds out the truth. The alternate Nanaya identity is a mechanism for dealing with his murderous instincts, identity issues, and sundry other mental problems who was patterned after the psychotic killer Tohno erroneously believes the original Nanaya would have been like if he were still alive (in fact, the original Nanaya was a perfectly pleasant child who valued the lives of others, albeit a bit aloof, something of a shut-in, and thoroughly traumatized).
    -   And then from the spin-off _Hana no Miyako_, there's also Shiki/SHIKI Nanaya, which is further complicated by the fact that SHIKI may or may not be the selfsame Shiki Nanaya from Tsukihime.
-   _When They Cry_:
    -   In _Umineko: When They Cry_, Rosa is seen by her daughter Maria as having one in order to justify her abusive behaviour, interpreting her mother's violent mood swings as being possessed by a "Black Witch".
    -   In _Ciconia: When They Cry_, a majority of Gauntlet Knights have multiple personalities. The narration points out that their condition is _not_ Dissociative Identity Disorder, which is caused by trauma and has only one "personality" awake at a time, but that they are born like this and have all their personalities active at once (most of the time; it's said that privacy between personalities _is_ possible), which makes it easier for them to perform the mental multitasking required to operate Gauntlet technology. The politically correct term for these individuals is "Congenital Parallel Processor", or "CPP" for short. The CPPs we know so far are Mariana, whose personalities are apparently always in conflict over who's in control, Naima, who can apparently change at will to a personality that best suits the situation, and most notably, the protagonist Miyao, whose split personality is the female Meow, although "coming out" as a CPP is treated _very_ seriously, and it's probable that even more of the characters might be CPPs.

    Web Animation 

-   In _50% OFF_, there are multiple personas holed up inside Haru's brain that have conflicting interests and personalities, most notably the "Impulsive Haru"
-   In _Alfred's Playhouse_, there is the superficially happy but very needy Alfred Alfer, who is secretly traumatised by his abusive childhood and uses a fantasy world to avoid thinking about his abuse, and there is vengeful, megalomaniacal Dictator Alfred, who wants to rule the world and is cruel to Alfred.
-   In _Algicosathlon Camp_, Navy has 3 alters (Yvan, Nave and Nivi). Their circumstances of development are unknown (aside from Nivi's, partially). Yvan seems to be triggered by strategy talks and hateful thoughts targetted at other contestants.
-   One episode of _My Story Animated_ is about a teenage girl named Robin with three personalities. She developed DID as a child but didn't realize it until her late teens.
-   In _Happy Tree Friends_, Flippy's evil personality, Fliqpy, is triggered by reminders of the W.A.R.
-   In _Inanimate Insanity_, Evil Paper is triggered by the words "Idiotic Island."
-   _Red vs. Blue_:
    -   The Director of Project Freelancer needed multiple Artificial Intelligences for his program but only had enough resources to create one, made from his own brain patterns, the Alpha. To get around this, he subjected Alpha to enough Mind Rape to cause its psyche to fragment. The fragments were then harvested and retooled into independent AI, and as you can imagine more than a few ended up unstable. Worse, the main antagonist of the _Reconstruction_ series has about eight of those fragments inside his head at the same time, and his/their goal is to collect the rest and reunite with the Alpha.
    -   In season 13, Doc, after spending several months trapped in another dimension and then lost in the caves of Chorus, eventually developed a split personality of his own- and it's exactly identical to Omega/O'Malley, the AI that once controlled him during the Blood Gulch Chronicles.

    Webcomics 

-   You know how Yumie and Yumiko from _Hellsing_ are mentioned above? The webcomic _And Shine Heaven Now_ takes it one step further, where it's revealed that aside from Yumie, Yumiko has _nine more personalities_ that were being suppressed by Iscariot. She suffered a temporary Heroic BSoD when Heinkel released them as the personalities sorted themselves out. In a big twist though, Yumiko was never the original personality. She was just led to believe she was such because she's the easiest to control.
-   _Bob and George_: George has an attack before the personality realizes it has the wrong character — and work.
-   In _Buster Wilde Weerwolf_, Bernard the straight human and Buster the gay werewolf share the same body.
-   Chelsea Grinn of _Chimneyspeak_ has four, progressively less sane, personalities.
-   Somewhat minor character Clive/Ernest in _Concession_: Clive is passive and straight, while Ernest is gay and rather assertive.
-   _Drowtales_: Sharess. In the Daydream Archive Story dealing with her life after becoming a disembodied entity of Pure Aura (Aura is the Drow equivalent to a soul) she battles a couple of Nether Gods, consumes their essence, rewrites the existence of the entirety of the Nether Plane that had currently been attacking the Drowtales Main Archive's world while simultaneously sealing all portals into that plane with herself lost on the other side of the portal. Once that is done, she promptly shatters into thousands of tiny individual consciousnesses, each with the individual ability to rewrite the physical reality of the Nether World she found herself inside of within a few hundred meters of herself. They can consume other copies of herself to access the ability to manipulate reality on a wider scale. Their children also have this ability. So yeah, that's thousands of Mini-Gods running around upon this poor unsuspecting Nether World...
-   _Dumbing of Age_: Amber copes with her trauma and stress by creating Amazi-Girl, a vigilante modeled after Batman. The twist is that _Amber_ is the dangerous one, because it's Amazi-Girl who shares Batman's stoicism, strict moral code, and self-control. After _Amber_ nearly guts Joyce's would-be rapist Ryan, Amazi-Girl embodies this trope even more, as she's been going out fighting crime...and Amber has no memory of it.
-   _Homestuck_: Calliope and Caliborn. She is probably the sweetest, kindest, most innocent character in the entire comic, and she uses the most passive class possible in the game. He, on the other hand, is evil, has the most active class possible in the game, loves to pretend he's Jigsaw, and is turned on by his disgust for tender, non-sexual displays of affection.
    -   This is _normal_ for juveniles of their species. At what amounts to puberty, one of the personalities "kills" the other one and takes over the body permanently. At least in this specific case, the two personalities have been aware of each other since early childhood and communicate through notes. They're ... not fond of each other. What's not normal, even by their species's standards, is using SBURB's Dream Land mechanics to kill the other personality way ahead of schedule.
    -   There's also Gamzee, though in his case there seems to be _three_ personalities: a 'good' host personality, which is kept dominant to begin with by Sopor slime and two 'evil' (or rather, sociopathic) alters.
-   _Gemini_ is a slice-of-life about Bernie and Z, and their life as multiple (and Z being a trans woman.)
-   In _General Protection Fault_, the Mirror Universe Nega-Trish _claims_ to be "schizophrenic" to explain her occasionally slipping mask, and the regulars' brief encounter with Posi-Trish. Both Nick and Patty realise that a geek with a psychological disorder would use the correct term for it, therefore she's lying.
-   In _Jix_, the titular character is the second personality of an invader, Remula, from an alien race who was surveying Earth. She stayed on Earth until she was sane again. She's manifested two more personalities since then, Lamerix the Mad Scientist and (male) superhero The Ambis.
-   Kano, the protagonist of _Kagerou_, has several personalities. The personality that answers to "Kano" is initially not aware of the others.
-   In _Moon Crest 24_, Derek and Dwayne both have the spirits of Drake and Daniel inside them respectively. And while Dwayne and Daniel are aware of each other, Derek and Drake are not.
-   _Mountain Time_ has Donna the Bears, who has multiple personalities that are all bears.
-   Anna/Susan Enfield from _Sire_, due to being a descendant of Edward Hyde.
-   _The Wotch_:
    -   Repeated transformations into a mind-altering form seem to cause this. For example, the 'Lilly amulet' causes the wearer to turn into a slightly hyperactive gender-bent child. At the beginning of the comic, the minds of Evan and Lilly are separate (Evan is gone while turned into Lilly, and vice versa) except for one incident where their minds were switched. Lately, however, Lilly seems to be present even while Evan is himself. Similarly, while the Jason-Sonja transformation was a simple Gender Bender, they seem to be diverging slightly as Sonja gains time existing.
    -   Weres seem to be similar, with the normal form and were form having separate minds (e.g. Yukio/Yukiko). Samantha and Katie are exempt because of the amulets that specifically suppress the were-mind and leave the normal mind in control, to the extent that they never developed separate minds in the first place (though Katie transformed once or twice without the amulet, all examples of multiple-personalities were developed over multiple and/or long-lasting transformations).
    -   Myrh (formed when magical slime ate Lord Sykos' maid) goes through a short time with this when a mind-meld with Ming and some jellybeans cause her human and slime portions to rebel against each other, as the slime attempts to become Ming.

-   Pretty Pink Ponytails from _Angel of Death_ has an alter named Anita who sometimes takes over.
-   Merry, in the _Whateley Universe_, has four personalities: Chaddy, her more innocent child self; Chad, her cynical, distrustful, early adolescent self; Merry, the most normal one and the dominant personality; and Mai, an evil AI she defeated that took up residence in and merged partially with her mind. Eventually these four were separated into pairs when Merry got accidentally cloned; Chad and Chaddy now live in Petra's head, while Merry and Mai now live in Paige's. And to those of you wondering why two of those personalities have male names... it's the Whateley Universe. Figure it out. Fey, meanwhile, doesn't so much have a Split Personality as she _actually has_ another person in her head, specifically Aunghadhail, an ancient Sidhe queen who died millennia ago but is now Back from the Dead, sort of.

-   _Everyman HYBRID_ heavily implies this:
    
    **Evan:** You may scare Evan, but he's just a bitch.
    
    -   Jossed later in the series—it turns out Evan's alter-ego isn't a true split personality, but a demonic entity that periodically takes control of his body.
-   _Marble Hornets_ is another example from the Slenderverse; Tim is presented with a surprisingly realistic version of dissociative identity disorder. As a result of long-lasting childhood trauma implied to be caused by the Operator, he develops an alternative personality state that appears throughout the series. This other personality, called "Masky" by the fanbase, moves and behaves like an angry or scared child, does not speak, and wears a mask over his face. He is implied to be a protective personality that split off to keep Tim safe from the Operator and often works with another masked individual (dubbed "Hoody") against the Operator and Alex. Tim himself has no recollections of the times when Masky is fronting and experiences frequent blackouts and amnesia. He also takes medication for an unnamed mental health condition.
    
    The other masked man, Brian, is more or less revealed in the comic issue 3.5 to not be plural himself.
    
-   Spoony has a split personality named "Dr. Insano" — for _Kickassia_, at least.
-   _Ten Little Roosters_:
    -   Ryan Haywood's "Mad King" persona from _Let's Play Minecraft_ is treated as this, to the point where he's afraid he actually killed Gavin Free and Michael Jones in the first two episodes. In actuality, this was part of Barbara Dunkelman's Evil Plan to frame Ryan as the murderer.
    -   In _Eleven Little Roosters_, it turns out that the Saboteur went insane at some point before the start of the series and developed an alternate persona encouraging them to betray the rest of the Rooster Corps. It's Gavin the 3rd, and his evil (well, evil_er_) persona is his supposed support coordinator, Operator Mikey.
-   From Venturian Tale's videos, we get Johnny Ghost and Jimmy Casket. Johnny is a (mostly) sane paranormal investigator, and Jimmy is an insane mass murderer, whose weapon of choice is a knife.
-   _Welcome To The Table_: When hardline Republican Texas takes his hat off, he becomes Austin, who manages to both out-hipster and out-woke California.
    -   Beach California is a laid-back Surfer Dude, and a far cry from the usual uptight hipster personality.

    Real Life 

-   Anne Heche once claimed to have multiple personalities. Celestia was an embodiment of God, writing essays on love and inventing a Conlang for use in prayer. She was still functional and active in film and TV all this time. Celestia disappeared after Heche took Ecstasy, went on an expedition in search of aliens who might help her, and woke up in a hospital with friends nearby, realizing that people did care about her.
-   American Football legend Herschel Walker is probably one of the most interesting real life cases of DID, as despite the disorder (or, possibly, because of it) the man was otherwise the very image of mental and physical toughness. When he was growing up he was actually somewhat overweight, as well as being crippingly shy and having a speech impediment. He was consequently bullied throughout elementary and middle school. The trauma eventually led to him creating an alternate "superhero" persona, which did a truly massive amount of exercise and took up sports as a coping mechanism. These changes would eventually lead him to play College Football at Georgia, where his Olympic level speed and immense size and strength more or less allowed him to run through anyone on the field, which naturally produced some of the most spectacular plays in the history of the game. Imagine superman playing football, and you get an idea of what it looked like. He wasn't diagnosed with DID until he retired from the NFL and his angry persona suddenly no longer had an outlet.
-   Kenneth Bianchi, one half of The Hillside Stranglers, attempted to set up an insanity defence. He claimed to have another personality named Steve Walker and, according to Bianchi, Walker was the killer - Bianchi himself was innocent. He managed to fool a couple of psychiatrists before a real multiple, Chris Costner-Sizemore (the real-life group/system on whom _The Three Faces of Eve_ was based) spotted him as a phony, it was confirmed via a simple trick by another doctor, Martin Orne, and the whole charade collapsed.
-   Probably the most well-known case of DID and the one credited (or blamed) with introducing the concept to the public, is _Sybil,_ whose story was published as a bestselling novel and adapted into a mini-series starring Sally Field.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Long before _Sybil_, however, _The Three Faces of Eve_ (book and film) and _The Five Of Me_ (book and film) about a British multiple, were well known to American audiences.
-   _The Minds of Billy Milligan_ is another non-fiction novel that explores a young man with twenty-three personalities. Milligan was tried for a series of rape-and-abductions in the 1970s and was the first (and to date only) person found not guilty by reason of insanity due to DID. His highly publicized story appeared in newspapers and magazines _before_ the publication of _Sybil_. Interestingly, Milligan was able to integrate at will and de-integrate again; he described it as unpleasant and didn't recommend that multiples try it.
-   There have been several autobiographies written by people with DID; for instance, Nellie Parsons Bean's _My Life as a Dissociated Personality_, writen in 1908; _The Flock: The Autobiography of a Multiple Personality_ by Joan Frances Casey (Fawcett, 1992) and _When Rabbit Howls_ by the Troops for Truddi Chase. Truddi Chase has also appeared on _The Oprah Winfrey Show_. Chris Costner-Sizemore, the real Eve, wrote her autobiography in two books, _I'm Eve_ and _A Mind Of My Own_. Ann Garvey's _Ann's Multiple World of Personality_ is an account of everyday living as a non-integrated multiple. There are lots of books by and about multiple personality here and here.
-   In 2019, Jeni Haynes, who has _2500 different personalities_ due to the extreme abuse her father put her through, made history by testifying in court with six of those personalities, each detailing a different part of her abuse. Putting a multiple on the witness stand was more commonly done in the 1980s, with Juanita Maxwell's murder trial and the testimony of Sarah Hood in Mark Peterson rape case, where a multiple accused a singlet<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  of taking advantage of her condition; several of her people took the stand to explain how their system worked.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
