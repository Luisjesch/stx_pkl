_"Bad books on writing and thoughtless English professors solemnly tell beginners to Write What You Know, which explains why so many mediocre novels are about English professors contemplating adultery."_

You don't say?

Seriously, though. In fiction, it is relatively common for the main character to be a writer or a reporter. This is in large part because many narrative works of art are initially driven by writers themselves (novelists, playwrights, screenwriters, etc.)

Interestingly, such characters are only occasionally Author Avatars. As the page quote indicates, one of the main pieces of advice writers hear is "Write What You Know", and since, as writers, they know writing, they have some idea of how a writer would react in a given situation. This trope is almost unavoidable when the setting revolves around a Show Within a Show and may lead to a Writer's Block Montage. Making characters who are writers by trade has a number of advantages for a narrative:

-   It helps get past the whole Realistic Diction Is Unrealistic problem, since a writer would be expected to know how to use big, fancy words.
-   Journalists and other kinds of nonfiction writers generally are expected to have investigative skills and an attention to detail that are useful to many kinds of plots, such as crime-solving.
-   Even if they don't use those skills in the plot, journalists are generally close to a wide variety of local important people like politicians and big events like disasters, but not actually one of those people or part of those events. This is the in-universe reason why Superman and Spider-Man went into journalism in the first place: so they could keep their ears to the ground and find out when and where superheroes are needed.
-   Freelance writers and journalists have a semi-plausible excuse for their One-Hour Work Week.
-   Fiction writers in-universe, because of that same "write what you know" principle, can theoretically have every Chekhov's Skill an amateur could plausibly have if they had researched it for a book.
-   However, writers who don't write also don't get paid, which means this can become One-Hour Work Week if the writer never actually gets around to doing any writing, or if they spend too much time doing something other than writing. In a one-off story, this can be handwaved on the basis that the character can always write a book about precisely the adventures they just experienced.

This can tie into the Framing Device, particularly if the story is written in the first person, i.e. the writer protagonist had an adventure, wrote up his account of it, published it, and this is supposedly the book you have just read.

As a corollary to this, there are a disproportionate number of movies about the movie industry, a disproportionate number of plays about actors and playwrights, a disproportionate number of songs about singers, and so on. Comic book authors similarly have the tendency to include the Sequential Artist. It is also probably why so many books praise the idea of reading books while suspiciously eyeing other forms of media.

Particularly clever or cynical writers have also been known to invoke a little Creator Career Self-Deprecation and write stories in which Writers Suck.

Super-Trope of "How I Wrote This Article" Article, which is writing about not knowing what to write anymore, and Writer's Block Montage. For characters who only become writers once they have some interesting stories to tell, see I Should Write a Book About This.

-   Sumiregawa Nenene of _Read or Die_.
-   There's also a number of manga about making manga, or at least doujin: _Genshiken_, _Comic Party_, _Doujin Work_, _Bakuman。_, _Even a Monkey Can Draw Manga_, _The Unpopular Mangaka and the Helpful Onryo-san_, _Ah... and Mm... Are All She Says_...
-   Manga that contain characters that are writers are also plentiful: _School Rumble_, _Naruto_, _Junjou Romantica_, _Kodocha_, _Otaku no Musume-san_ and _Fairy Tail_.

-   _Bakuman。_ is a manga about manga, with the main characters being a manga artist and author, and is coincidentally produced by a writer and an author as separate people.
-   Himeko's mother from _Hime-chan's Ribbon_ is a writer of young women's romance novels who often takes ideas from the real world into her stories, with little changes.
-   _Galaxy Express 999_ does this several times. At one point, a poor person Tetsuro meets is a would-be anime creator (who we are told, did manage to get her anime created), and episode 58 features a ghost who was a would-be manga writer in life. Episodes 60-61 have another would-be manga artist, and another one shows up in episode 101. And 111 too.
-   Sai Nanohana, father to Jubei-chan, popular writer of samurai period pulp, and Author Avatar.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable_ introduces the famed mangaka Kishibe Rohan, whose Stand lets him read and write into people like they are books. He shares many personality quirks with Hirohiko Araki, such as doing lots of research and preferring to experience things hands-on before writing them into their works. Rohan would later become the protagonist of multiple Spin-Off series, including the _Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan_ series.
-   _Fairy Tail_ has Supporting Protagonist Lucy who has spent much of the series writing a book. The trope is even played with when she tries to trick a villain by saying she needs to go the bathroom. The villain has prepared for such a cheap trick and shows Lucy a bucket that she may use instead of a toilet. Lucy pretends that she is actually going to use the bucket. The villain is embarrassed and looks the other way, and Lucy uses the opportunity to kick him in the crotch. She then notes that despite the bathroom trick being one of the oldest ones in the book, it actually worked and that she might use it in her own novel.
-   _Daily Lives of High School Boys_ have the "literature girl," who wrote a Romance Novel... and then trying to re-enact the scene herself.
-   Sae of _Hidamari Sketch_ is a seventeen-year-old who's already writing commercially.

-   Nitori from _Wandering Son_ shows a knack for writing throughout the series, typically being the one to write scripts for the school plays and often being shown writing. In high school, she even begins writing a book that can best be described as an in-universe version of the manga. When she goes to college at the end of the manga she says she wants to get into a writing-related career.
-   Nozaki of _Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun_ is mainly a Sequential Artist, but he sometimes writes plays for Hori of the school drama club in exchange for Hori drawing backgrounds for him.

-   _The Comic Artist and his Assistants_ is a comedy about pervy manga artist Aito Yuuki and his staff of Beleaguered Assistants.
-   The protagonist of _ERASED_ is a struggling manga artist, which doesn't have that much relevance to its main plot of traveling back in time to catch a serial killer.
-   The protagonist of _Dagashi Kashi_ wants to be a manga artist, but his art isn't that good.
-   _Kaasan: Mom's Life_ stars a mother who works as a mangaka.
-   _Nichijou_'s tritagonist Mio is an aspiring mangaka who draws yaoi doujin in her spare time. Fellow Four-Temperament Ensemble member Mai has also written at least one unpublished manga...though her style tends toward the same absurdist humor that runs the series.
-   Episode 10 of _Paranoia Agent_ shows an anime studio struggling to put a pilot together. The creators are overworked, irresponsible, and hostile towards each other; and the episode plays out like Satoshi Kon and Madhouse's twisted sadomasochistic fantasy of ending it all.
-   While she doesn't have anything published, Ayano in _Asteroid in Love_ is actually a budding fantasy novelist. She left the Literature Club for the Newspaper Club mainly because the former seems to be more interested in literary criticism than creative writing, while the Newspaper Club's president is willing to provide feedback on her writings. Her limelight chapter shows she takes so much time writing that her classmate notices she keeps Asleep in Class.
-   _Why the Hell Are You Here, Teacher!?_: The eleventh arc, starting with Chapter 101, focuses on Minamoto, a teacher who's also a mangaka, and Kobayashi, a student who dreams of being one as well.
-   _The Kindaichi Case Files_:
    -   Itsuki is a freelance writer who used to write for a weekly paper a decade ago. That being said, he functions more as an Intrepid Reporter in many a mystery case arc.
    -   In _The (37-year-old) Kindaichi Case Files_, Fumi, as an adult in her late 20's, works as a mystery novelist.
    -   Some of the individual case arcs have a writer as among the participants in a given case. Which role said writer plays varies, depending on the case arc in question.

Enid Coleslaw of _Ghost World_ was an artist, as is Dan Pussey of _Pussey!_ It's alluded to in _David Boring_ that the title character is a multimedia artist. At least two of the main characters (including _the_ main character) of _Ice Haven_ are writers. _Twentieth Century Eightball_ is a collection of short-stories from Clowes, _many_ of which are about artists (_Art School Confidential_, _Ink Studs_, etc.).
-   _Transmetropolitan_'s main character, Spider Jerusalem.
-   Steve Rogers (a.k.a. Captain America) has worked as a comic book artist — even illustrating a _Captain America_ comic!
-   Tintin is nominally a reporter, although he has only rarely been seen to file any stories.
-   _Wild's End_. The main group includes a writer and reporter. Then we are introduced to two eminent sci-fi writers. There are multiple sequences where these characters sit and write about their experiences.
-   In _Dream Country_, the third book of _The Sandman (1989)_, a struggling writer gets famous thanks to his imprisonment and rape of Calliope, the Greek muse. He buys her from another writer, whom it is implied became famous through the same means. Unsurprisingly, Calliope is not thrilled about this arrangement; neither is the title character, with whom Calliope once had a child and who delivers some karmic justice to her captor.
-   The first main character introduced in _Strikeforce: Morituri_, Harold Everson, is an aspiring writer. He writes about his adventures with the Morituri and dreams of living on through his work like Hemmingway.
-   The _Astro City_ story "Where the Action Is" follows the tribulations of a comic book writer.

    Comic Strips 

-   Jon Arbuckle of _Garfield_ was specifically identified as a cartoonist in early strips, at least before he essentially became a full-time Cloudcuckoolander loser guy. In the cartoon, however, his profession regularly drives the conflict in the plot.
-   The father in _The Family Circus_ is also a cartoonist. The family seems to be based on Bil Keane's. His son in the strip, Jeffy, shares the name of his son in real life, who eventually took over doing the strip.
-   Michael Patterson of _For Better or for Worse_. His first novel is a best-seller.
-   Sydney in _Dykes to Watch Out For_ is an academic writer and there have been other minor characters like Deidre and Anjlai who write but main character and semi-Author Avatar Mo has creator Alison Bechdel's bibliophile tendencies instead of being a writer herself.
-   Pretty much everybody in modern _Funky Winkerbean_ is a writer or comics artist, is going to become a writer or comics artist, is a writer or comic artist's girlfriend/wife, has their life revolve around writing or comics in some other capacity, or is about to be Put on a Bus. In this universe, writers are the _only_ successful and fulfilled individuals, and are irresistible to the opposite sex. Especially if they write comics.
-   Val in _Retail_ is an aspiring one, and hopes to someday be able to afford to quit Grumbel's in order to devote her time to it. Cooper's new job at the end of the comic, which pays twice as much as Grumbel's did, finally allows her to do so.

    Fan Works 

-   Naruto in _A Growing Affection_ ghost wrote for Jiraiya during the time skip, and helped with the outline for the next few books as well.
-   Vale, the protagonist of the _Hunger Games_ fanfic _Some Semblance of Meaning_, wants to be a writer, even if she simultaneously acknowledges this aspiration as "unrealistic". Her writer's mind affects her perception of events at times, and her storytelling actually comes into play when Kit asks her on his deathbed to tuck him in, and she tells him about a "land without districts" where good people go when they die, and later, when she echoes that story during the final confrontation.
-   One of the sidestories of _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_ features Gary meeting a former Pokémon trainer-turned-novelist named Casey Snagem, who has written many best-sellers. In another, it's revealed that Elite Four member Lorelei writes magazine articles and light novels under the Pen Name "Prima".
-   Played with in the _Dragon Age_ series _Skyhold Academy Yearbook,_ in which students Rory and Jim are aspiring writers. Specifically, they write in-universe fanfic about their teachers. It’s actually a device for the (real) authors, allowing them to write Alternate Universe stories about the characters and include them in what is already an Alternate Universe fanfiction.
-   In _A Prize for Three Empires_, Carol Danvers is a pretty successful novelist.
-   Both Klar Kent and his wife Lyra from _Superman of 2499: The Great Confrontation_ are reporters. On top of it, Lyra is a popular writer.
-   The imagination of Wendy in _Not Old, Alone or Done For_ hasn't changed much since childhood. She puts it to good use through writing.

    Films — Animated 

-   The corollary to this is "Most animators are artists." In _Tangled_'s musical number "When Does My Life Begin?", Rapunzel demonstrates a wide variety of talents, but the only one of them that becomes crucial to the plot is her art skill.
-   In the Novelization of _Turning Red_, Mei and her friends are all fanfic writers.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _An Angel at My Table_ is a biopic of New Zealand writer Janet Frame.

-   Holly Martins winds up as one after the end of the film.
-   _Barton Fink_ is about a writer suffering from writer's block, written while the Coens themselves were having difficulty with _Miller's Crossing_. This writer really wants to make arty, weighty, important movies about the plight of the common man (mainly Fink), similar to his successful play, but gets assigned a wrestling picture instead.
-   In the film _Croupier_ the protagonist is a novelist working as a croupier for a day job. The film really starts to get interesting when he commences writing a thinly disguised roman á clef entitled _I, Croupier,_ the plot of which resembles his own life.
-   Charlie Kaufman's _Adaptation._ is a particularly surreal take on this trope. Kaufman himself (as played by Nic Cage) is the protagonist, and the movie is at least in part about the writing of itself. Then it gets even more surreal. The writer credits for the movie include Donald Kaufman, Charlie Kaufman's _fictional_ twin brother, who's also a character in the movie, and also a writer (and also played by Nic Cage).
-   The Jet Li movie, _Dr. Wai in "The Scripture with No Words"_, in which Li plays a Non-Action Guy for once, a writer picturing himself as a badass adventurer he created on paper. All the action scenes in the movie are Imagine Spot which Li puts himself in while thinking about how to progress with his latest story.
-   _Stranger Than Fiction_ also uses the device in an eerie, roundabout, and darkly humorous manner.
-   _Sunset Boulevard:_ Protagonist and narrator Joe Gillis is a screenwriter, and this proves important — he catches Norma Desmond's interest as she believes he can help her complete the script of her great comeback film. To complete the triangle, Joe's girlfriend Betty is another aspiring screenwriter.
-   _Shakespeare in Love,_ naturally.
-   Marty's father becomes a bestselling science fiction author in _Back to the Future_.

-   Brother Gilbert in _Dragonheart_ wants to compose epic ballads, and spends part of the film trying to write one about protagonist Bowen.
-   It would be shorter to list the Woody Allen movies where one of the main characters _isn't_ a writer.
-   _Lady in the Water_: There is a writer whose future work is destined to save the world. Did I mention that M. Night Shyamalan plays the character himself?

-   In _Withnail and I_, the character only officially known as "I" is a writer, but all he writes is "just thoughts, really." His writing serves as the movie's occasionally Fauxlosophic Narration.
-   In _How to Lose Friends & Alienate People_, which is based on a memoir by a British journalist, most of the characters are journalists (and a lot of them have hobbies such as writing poetry or novels).
-   _The Coward_: Protagonist Amitabha Ray is a screenwriter who accidentally runs into his ex-girlfriend while road-tripping to get ideas for his next story. (Even better, he shares a last name with the writer/director of the movie, Satyajit Ray.)

-   _Factotum_: Chinaski is working toward becoming a writer.
-   _Following_: The protagonist is a struggling, unemployed young writer.
-   In _The Shining_, the fact that the protagonist is a writer who is suffering severely from writer's block is the reason the family goes to the hotel in the first place.
-   _The Third Man_: Holly Martens, the protagonist, is an American pulp Western writer - in this case, it's drawing attention to the fact that he's somewhat afflicted with arrested emotional development, considering Harry Lime to be basically a good guy because they were friends once. At least until he gets a look at what Lime was really like.
-   _Basic Instinct_: Catherine Tramell, the female lead, is a crime novelist. And a particularly manipulative and genre-savvy one at that; by the end of the film it's revealed that she set up almost every event to emulate her own book.
-   _The Door In The Floor_: The protagonist is a children's book author and artist.

-   _Cabin by the Lake_ centers around a scriptwriter's problems to write a satisfying conclusion to his story... and is also a serial killer.
-   _In the Mouth of Madness_: Sutter Cane is the most popular (horror) writer who ever lived and he's _the villain_ no less. At its core, the film looks at what the awesome power of writing means to the characters who occupy the novels themselves.
-   Baltimore Hall of _Twixt_ is a writer, with the difficulties of writing a plot and avoiding being pigeonholed in one's genre being almost as center-stage as the vampire-related killings.
-   Both _Swimming with Sharks_ and _The Player_ are centered around some producers in Hollywood, and of course, the trouble they get from writers.
-   _Set It Up_: Harper, one of the protagonists, is an aspiring sports journalist. Her boss, Kirsten, is a prominent one.

-   Super me (2019) is a movie about Sang Yu, a financially broken writer, and all the movie remarks how he is a "good writer".

    Literature 

-   _The Lord of the Rings_ is itself the Framing Device variant of this. Which is why so many other fantasy writers/stories do it. Tolkien claimed to be the translator of a book originally written by Frodo (and also Frodo's original manuscript was lost, and Tolkien was actually translating a work copied by an anonymous human). Slightly averted in that Tolkien wasn't a professional writer (he was a professor of Philology, or as we would say in America, Historical Linguistics). But since Tolkien is primarily known as a writer (despite having researched and edited a section of the Oxford English Dictionary and revolutionized his professional field), it seems fair to list this here. He probably invoked it because he realized he wasn't the world's best writer (he wasn't) and because he was trying to make a mythology (which he pretty much succeeded in doing, more or less). Frodo can be seen writing the book at the beginning of the movie, and then hands it to Sam in the last scene before getting on the ship to Valinor. In-universe, Frodo is of course continuing a family tradition: with Bilbo Baggins having authored _The Hobbit_. Bilbo writing his book is actually the reason why Frodo goes on his adventures to begin with: because Bilbo decides to skip the second part of his birthday party in order to take his finished book to Rivendell (it was Lord Elrond who originally requested the book). When he does so, he leaves the Ring behind: Gandalf then seizes the moment to convince Frodo to undertake the journey to destroy the Ring.
    -   Tolkien also invoked the trope outside of his books. He had a professor alter ego called Lowdham, and an academic in-universe alter ego Pengolodh, which names he used to write articles about his invented world without tooting his own horn.
-   Morag Gunn, the protagonist of Margaret Laurence's novel _The Diviners (1974)_, is a writer.
-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_:
    -   Ford Prefect's job as a writer for the eponymous Encyclopedia Exposita provides him with an excuse to go on his dangerously irresponsible adventures. His problems with his editors (who butchered a long, complex, beautifully written article he spent fifteen years on into two words) are a major point in the series.
    -   And Arthur Dent worked for the BBC. Take a guess at who Douglas worked for. This gets lampshaded in the Quandary Phase of the radio series, where Arthur's producer is played by the original producer of _Hitchhiker's_, Geoffrey Perkins. A significantly Downplayed Trope in this case, however: in the first volume of the novel this fact is confined to a single brief mention that he "worked in local radio" that never really comes up again afterwards, and indeed Adams never quite gets around to going into specifics, so Arthur could just as easily have been a sound engineer or even a presenter.
-   The _Raffles_ stories are framed as memoirs by Raffles's friend Bunny Manders, who, outside of being a writer, works as a journalist in the stories proper.
-   Richard Matheson:
    -   "Mad House" focuses on a writer with a nasty case of writer's block, among other problems.
    -   And the protagonist in _What Dreams May Come_ was a writer for television. He was made a pediatrician in the movie.
-   Pat Murphy:
    -   In _Adventures In Space And Time With Max Merriwell_, the title character is an author who meets living avatars of his Pen Names on a cruise. The other characters all take a writing workshop with him. The character Pat Murphy (Pat Murphy often names characters after herself) writes a blog called The Bad Grrl's Guide to physics. Murphy is a science writer.
    -   In _Wild Girls_, two twelve-year-old girls write a story together. When they win a writing contest, they get to take a writing workshop with the eccentric Vera Volante.
-   Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle:
    -   Allen Carpentier, the protagonist of _Inferno (Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle)_, is a Speculative Fiction writer, just like Niven and Pournelle. In some ways, Carpentier seems to represent Niven (more so than Pournelle), and expies of many other SF authors and other then-famous personages appear in the story, but at the same time, Carpentier's depiction is used to savage personal shortcomings that Niven himself might reasonably have.
    -   _Footfall_ features several sci-fi authors, including clear Author Avatar versions of both authors as well as one of Robert A. Heinlein, brought together by the government to help think up ways to fight an alien invasion.
    -   _Lucifer's Hammer_ (partly based on a scene from the first draft of _Footfall_ that their editor demanded they expand into a novel in its own right) features writers and journalists among the characters living through the collapse of civilization after a major comet impact.
-   Jo March (later Bhaer) of _Little Women_ is pretty much a perfect example of an Author Avatar (although in general, done quite well).
-   Robert A. Heinlein loves this trope. Among his protagonists who are writers who bear more than a passing resemblance to the author or friends of his:
    -   Jubal Harshaw of _Stranger in a Strange Land_, who writes in a variety of genres and media, under a bunch of pseudonyms.
    -   Hazel Stone of _The Rolling Stones (1952)_, who writes a pulpy sci-fi adventure TV series.
    -   The nameless protagonist of _—All You Zombies—_, who spends some time writing stories for a "True Confessions" magazine, and gets the nickname "The Unmarried Mother" partly from this fact.
    -   The protagonist of _The Cat Who Walks Through Walls_ is a fiction writer who lives on an orbital space colony.
    -   The final chapter of _The Number of the Beast_ is a huge cross-dimensional convention attended by sci-fi authors and characters from multiple fictional universes.
-   Quite a few of Stephen King's protagonists are also writers.
    -   Novelists:
        -   _Misery_: Paul Sheldon is the author of a best-selling series of Victorian-era romance novels surrounding the heroine character Misery Chastain. The antagonist, a fan of his books, doesn't like the way he tried to conclude the series and goes off the deep end.
        -   _'Salem's Lot_: Ben Mears
        -   _The Dark Tower_: He's written himself into the story (though not as the protagonist).
        -   "Word Processor of the Gods", a short story in the collection _Skeleton Crew_.
        -   "The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet", also in _Skeleton Crew_: Reg Thorpe
        -   _The Tommyknockers_: Roberta "Bobbi" Anderson, a writer of Westerns although it's a bit of a misdirection, as she actually becomes the first victim, and her friend Gard, a poet, steps in as the true protagonist.
        -   _The Dark Half_: Thad Beaumont
        -   _It_: Bill Denbrough, a horror writer.
        -   "The Langoliers", a novella published in the collection _Four Past Midnight_: Bob Jenkins is a mystery writer who does some Genre Savvy analysis of the situation.
        -   "Secret Window, Secret Garden", also in _Four Past Midnight_: Mort Rainey
        -   _Desperation_, and _The Regulators_: Johnny Marinville
        -   _Bag of Bones_: Mike Noonan is a novelist suffering from writer's block.
        -   _Lisey’s Story_: Scott Landon (Lisey's deceased husband)
        -   "The Body" (AKA _Stand by Me_) Gordon Lachance
        -   "Umney's Last Case", a short story in _Nightmares & Dreamscapes_
        -   "The Road Virus Heads North", a short story in _Everything's Eventual_: Richard Kinell, a horror writer.
        -   "Big Driver", a short story in _Full Dark, No Stars_: Tess, a mystery writer.

        -   Selena St. George in _Dolores Claiborne_ is a journalist.
        -   _The Colorado Kid_: Three of the four main characters are reporters or otherwise work for a newspaper.
        -   _CELL_: Clayton Riddell is a writer of graphic novels.
        -   _The Tommyknockers_: Jim Gardener is a poet.
        -   "1408", a short story in _Everything's Eventual_: Mike Enslin writes non-fiction books about haunted places.
        -   _The Shining_: Jack Torrance is working on a play and has a pile of short stories under his belt.
        -   _Carrie_: Sue Snell wrote a book about her experiences.
        -   _The Stand_: Harold Lauder is an amateur writer. He writes fantasy stories in the second person plural, and later a personal diary.
        -   _The Green Mile_: Paul Edgecombe is the narrator, a main character, and also writes a huge portion of the book.
        -   In _Doctor Sleep_, Chetta is a poet and her granddaughter's husband is a history professor taking a sabbatical to write a book.
    -   The protagonist in _Joyland_ is a magazine writer/editor.
-   Stephen King's son, Joe Hill, has got in on the act to some degree, too. Though his first two novels bucked the trend by having main characters who were musicians, his third novel _NOS4A2_ follows the protagonist from childhood and has her grow up to become a successful author and illustrator of children's books. A number of his short story protagonists are writers too, such as the main character of "Best New Horror".
-   The first book in the _Legacy of the Aldenata_ series by _John Ringo_ starts off with a clear Author Avatar sci-fi writer being called in as an expert by the government to help deal with the consequences of First Contact with aliens. A clear equivalent of David Weber is mentioned as being in the same group.
-   The primary protagonist of the _Troy Rising_ series by John Ringo, Tyler Vernon, was originally the author of a webcomic called _TradeHard_. By the end of the first book, he is by several orders of magnitude the richest man in the world, who (as is mentioned several times) "talks to the US President when Vernon makes the time in Vernon's schedule".
-   The male protagonist in _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ was a writer.
-   John Irving loves this trope.
    -   _The World According to Garp_. Garp's first two novels have plots that are similar to Irving's first two novels. In fact, a rejection letter Garp receives for one of his stories was one that Irving received in Real Life for the same story.
    -   The narrator of Irving's _The 158 Pound Marriage_ is a semi-successful author of historical fiction. The novel describes but also results from an author's frustrating, year-long research trip to Vienna, which yielded no intriguing fictional narratives but did yield a hot wife.
    -   _A Widow for One Year_. Ruth Cole, the protagonist, is a successful writer. Her father, who is a main character in both sections of the book, is a writer/illustrator of Not for Children children's books. Her long-lost mother writes detective fiction.
    -   The youngest sister in _The Hotel New Hampshire_ writes a book.
    -   Daniel Baciagalupo in _Last Night in Twisted River_ is a novelist. A novelist whose books include one on Vietnam, and another on abortion.
-   Kurt Vonnegut:
    -   His novels have the recurring character of Kilgore Trout, though _he's_ not exactly how the author consciously inserts himself into his stories. (Actually, if Trout is based on anybody, he is based on Theodore Sturgeon, of Sturgeon's Law.)
    -   The main character in his novel _Cat's Cradle_ is a writer who starts out doing research for a book he's planning to write about the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Later in the story, he takes an assignment from a magazine to visit the island of San Lorenzo and write an article on it, where he gets more than he bargained for.
-   Erica Jong:
    -   _Fear of Flying_ and its sequels, _How to Save Your Own Life_ and _Parachutes and Kisses_: Isadora Wing is loosely based on Jong and the stories on her personal life.
    -   _Sappho's Leap_ is about the poet Sappho.

-   Jake Woods and Clarence Abernathy, respective protagonists of the first two books in a trilogy by Randy Alcorn, are both newspaper columnists.
-   The dual narrators of the _Ambergris_ book _Shriek: An Afterword_ are an ex-gallerist and an ex-historian respectively, and both earned their living for much of their lives as freelance writers of various essays and articles. Since the book is a fictional autobiography, the financial problems associated with the profession are often in the foreground.
-   Greg Bear's science fiction novel _Queen of Angels_ revolves around a novelist, playwright, and poet, who has just killed eight people. Another main character is also a writer.
-   Dean Koontz seems to be quite fond of this trope; to name just a few examples, the protagonist of his book _Cold Fire_ is a reporter, and in _Lightning_, the main character is a novelist.
-   Henry Fitzroy, the vampire from Tanya Huff's _Blood Books_ series (turned into the TV show _Blood Ties (2007)_), is a romance novelist. In the TV version, he writes and draws graphic novels.
-   Lily from _The Secret Life of Bees_ discovers and professes her talent for writing, mostly fiction.
-   L. M. Montgomery often used this trope:
    -   Anne Shirley in _Anne of Green Gables_ publishes various short stories that are published. Several times in the series people accuse her of writing friends and family into her stories. The Anne books are in many ways autobiographical with Anne's life reflecting many events in L. M. Montgomery's life including the deaths of her children.
    -   In _The Blue Castle_ has a mysterious writer who ends up with a close connection to the main characters.
    -   _A Tangled Web (1931)_ there is an unseen book-writing lady that is mentioned. Some characters live in the hope that she will "write them into a story". Others live in terror of her doing exactly the same thing.
    -   Emily, of the _Emily of New Moon_ books, knows she not only wants to be a writer, she _is_ a writer with all of herself. The people around her can use this need to manipulate her if they want — promising her that she can go to college, no strings attached, but only _if_ she gives up writing fiction for the entire time. And in the third book, Dean Priest tells her that _A Seller of Dreams_ is, basically, "cute," because he's jealous of her writing and wants her to give it up, even though he realizes it is an unfinished masterpiece.
-   William Goldman's _The Color Of Light_ is about this trope. It goes a bit over the top in lampshading it, though.
-   Scheherazade gives the impression of being some Arab Coffeehouse bard's ideal woman.
-   Dr. Watson is, of course, a medical professional, but it's on account of his writings about Holmes that Holmes is so well known. Of course, the stories he writes that make Holmes famous are the same ones that _we read_, so this could be the world's first meta example of the trope.
    -   Being one of the few doubled tropes on this page, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was also a doctor. Naturally a doctor-writer would write about a doctor-writer.
    -   Bram Stoker's _Dracula_ goes even further. It's presented as a series of journal entries and articles compiled by Mina Harker, and the construction of the book itself assists the heroes in uncovering Dracula's secrets. So the writing of the book is actually a plot point within the book.
-   Judy Abbott, the heroine of _Daddy-Long-Legs_, goes to college specifically because of her writing. Her anonymous benefactor likes a funny essay she wrote about the orphanage where she grew up, and agrees to sponsor her education so she can become a writer. Over the course of the story, she becomes a published author of short stories and then novels.
-   The narrator in Nikos Kazantzakis's stunning novel _Zorba the Greek_ is a writer, an attribute for which Zorba often pokes fun at him.
-   The narrator of the framing story in _Life of Pi_ is an author who wrote a historical fiction novel that should technically have been amazing, but to him was so unlikely to raise any eyebrows in book publishing that he tossed the entire manuscript. Then at a café he met someone who told him about a young Indian man named Piscine...
-   In Vladimir Nabokov's _Lolita_, the narrator Humbert Humbert is a literature professor, and although he never refers to novels that he has actually published, he does tell Charlotte Haze that he was working on a novel when she finds some very suspect entries in his journal.
    -   He is writing a rather large scholarly piece on the works of Rimbaud, Verlaine, and Baudelaire, which I believe is actually published early on in the novel. This is a common trope for Nabokov, at least for his English language novels; almost every one of them features some sort of writer as the protagonist. As we approach the end of his career, the number of similarities between this writer/protagonist is notably increased. Nabokov notes this, and frequently takes a poke at his protagonists for being shades of a more 'real' life.
    -   According to legend, the implications that this trope presents almost led Nabokov to destroy his materials for Lolita, on the fear that people would think he was actually Humbert.
    -   One of Nabokov's books actually begins with a scene the protagonist is watching out his window that he decides he wants to use to start his novel someday.
-   In Tempe O'Kun's _Windfall_ Max is an aspiring writer, while Kylie's mother Laura was the lead writer on the Show Within a Show that they acted in.
-   The lead of P. G. Wodehouse's _Life Among the Chickens_ is a writer named James Garnet. Early in the story, he shares a train carriage with a pretty young woman who (unbeknownst to her) is reading his novel, and says to her father that she likes the protagonist. The following quote forces the reader to frown at the novel and go "hang a minute!"
    
    "But I like Arthur," said Phyllis, and she smiled—the first time Garnet had seen her do so.
    
    Garnet also smiled to himself. Arthur was the hero. He was a young writer. Ergo, Arthur was himself.
    
    -   Also, both members of the Alpha Couple in Wodehouse's _Something Fresh_ are writers for the same pulp magazine publisher. In fact, Ashe Marson's character Gridley Quayle becomes a minor plot point because Freddie, son of the Earl of Emsworth, is a huge fan of his, which makes Freddie all too willing to give Ashe the prized scarab he stole from his father, who in turn stole it from Ashe's employer by accident.
-   One of Hercule Poirot's friends in _Third Girl_ is a middle-aged mystery-writing Englishwoman, much like Agatha Christie, who tries a spot of amateur detecting. And, in accordance with the tropes of the genre, is clonked over the head shortly thereafter.
    -   Agatha Christie has several characters who are writers, including Ariadne Oliver and Miss Marple's nephew Raymond West, both of whom appear repeatedly in supporting roles throughout her stories.
-   The narrator-protagonist of _The War of the Worlds_ is an academic author. H.G. Wells wrote a lot of non-fiction alongside his novels and short stories, though he is less known for the former today.
-   The protagonist in Terry Pratchett's non-Discworld short story "Final Reward" is the author of a long-selling series of barbarian fantasy novels.
    -   From the _Discworld_ novels, William De Worde started off as a freelance letter writer, then later becomes a newspaper publisher and journalist in _The Truth_. Appropriate when one realizes that Pratchett was originally a journalist himself.
    -   In _Maskerade_, Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg travel to Ankh-Morpork after they learn Nanny's been cheated out of royalties from her risque cookbook. The throwaway gag about spelling "famine" with seven letters is a Shout-Out to the same error that occurred in Real Life.
    -   In _Snuff_, Vimes has to meet with a famous children's book writer Miss Beedle. Walking up to her house, he muses that he has no idea what writers do at home. Possibly sit in their nightgown drinking champagne. A footnote remarks that this is completely true.
-   The protagonist of _The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant_ is a successful writer whose life quickly turns to shit. When things start getting better, he refuses to believe it is real...
-   _The Tomorrow Series_: Both Ellie and Chris are writers.
-   French author Bernard Werber loves to put writers as characters: journalists and novelists are all over the place, it seems.
-   British author and cartoonist Ros Asquith has done this several times. Letty in the Teenage Worrier series (although her dream is to become a film director, she frequently mentions that she is a published author as well), Cordelia in the _Girl Writer_ series, and Flowkwee in _Letters From an Alien Schoolboy_ are all examples.
-   An egregious example is Jonathan Franzen's _Freedom_, whose story is largely told from the perspective of Patty Berglund writing her autobiography. Even though Patty knows she isn't too smart and otherwise shies away from intellectual life, she seems to write about as well as Jonathan Franzen does in the rest of the novel.
-   Although her calling in life is to be a Guardian, Mercedes Lackey creation Diana Tregarde's income comes from writing romance novels.
    -   Her Author Avatar in the _Heralds of Valdemar_ series is a historian and chronicler, as well. She only gets a speaking role in the _Exile_ series, however.
-   _House of Leaves_ is a more indirect use of this trope. To quote the quote on its page, "It's a book about a book about a film about a house that is a labyrinth."
-   Betsy in the _Betsy-Tacy_ series is all about telling stories in the early books, then naturally progresses to a writer as she grows older. She shares her passion for writing with her future husband. This makes sense, as Betsy was basically an Expy of the writer Maud Hart Lovelace, who was also married to another passionate writer.
-   The narrator-protagonist of Carol Shields's _Unless_ is a writer and translator.
-   _The Red Tree_ follows Sara Crowe, a writer suffering from an intense block after the suicide of her girlfriend.
-   In _The Book of Joe_, the protagonist is Joe Goffman, a successful author struggling with his writer's block.
-   In _Fame_, there's only a single character in the entire novel who doesn't see himself as a writer or character. The rest of the cast consists of three writers, a forum addict, a number of fictional characters, a world-famous actor, a man who invents his own new life, and a woman who ends up as a fictional character against her will.
-   Lord Peter Wimsey's love interest Harriet Vane is a mystery writer. And that's not the only similarity between her and Dorothy Sayers.
-   _Wonder Boys_ — both novel and film — is about an English professor who is stuck in the middle of writing an endless, soul-sucking Door Stopper of a novel.
-   Charlie Bucktin, the main (but not titular) character of Craig Silvey's _Jasper Jones_, is an aspiring author. And so is his dad.
-   Tosca Lee's _Demon: A Memoir_ is premised around not one, but two main characters as writers: one, an editor who has tried and failed for years to write novels, and second, a demon with a marvelous storytelling gift but no ability to physically write and publish his story. Hence, a partnership (of sorts?) is born.…
-   _Kill time or die trying_, being based on real events, most of which the authors were present for, features the authors themselves as characters. Subverted, in that the fact their being writers is barely mentioned, apparently to avoid spoiling the fun of trying to figure out which characters are the authors.
-   Jack McEvoy in the Michael Connelly novels _The Poet_ and _The Scarecrow_ is a journalist just as Michael Connelly was before becoming a mystery writer. Said reporter ends up uncovering serial killers in both stories.
-   A very literal example of this trope, Stephen Glass, former journalist for _The New Republic_ and who is most well-known for partially or wholly fabricating many of his stories, went on to write a semi-fictional novel about a journalist who is caught fabricating his stories.
-   Ben Mason was a poet before he was turned into a zombie.
-   Meg in _This Tragic Universe_, by Scarlett Thomas, is a Starving Artist paying the bills (just) with ghostwritten genre fiction while trying to write a "proper" novel that has gone through multiple rewrites over several years. (And yes, she's contemplating adultery).
-   In many a Chivalric Romance, the narrator praises generosity to minstrels, and the porter — who, being in charge of the door, could keep minstrels out — is often the Butt-Monkey of the tale.
-   Tom Holt has two in _My Hero!_; the protagonist is a writer of Heroic Fantasy adventure stories, and the second is a mysteriously-vanished western writer who has gotten Trapped in TV Land and needs the help of the first to escape from the story.
-   _The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica_ takes this trope and runs wild with it. The main characters, as revealed at the end of the first book, are Charles Williams, C. S. Lewis, and J. R. R. Tolkien—additionally, H. G. Wells, James Barrie, and other notable authors are prominent side characters. They are initiated as Caretakers of a fantastic dimension called the Archipelago and the Imaginarium Geographica, which is an atlas of everything that ever existed in myth and fable, which ultimately results in each of them deciding I Should Write a Book About This (which become the classics we know today).
-   In the new All Souls Trilogy, the main character Diana Bishop is a historian (with a specialty in Alchemic Texts) who just so happens to be a witch, an extremely powerful one, who pretty much holds the fate of the three creature races — witch, deamon and vampire — and maybe the world in her hands. The author, Deborah Harkness, is _also_ a historian — this is her first fiction work. Taking that into account, we can see Harkness having the same reaction to Matthew Clairmont, a vampire; he's about fifteen hundred years old? THINK OF THE HISTORY HE'S LIVED THROUGH!!
-   The _Mervyn Stone_ series by Nev Fountain. Whodunnits about the former script editor of a cancelled sci-fi series by a playwright and _Doctor Who_ audio-drama writer.
-   _The Last Dragon Chronicles_: David's a geology student, but becomes a writer through Gadzooks' help. d'Lacey confesses that David is a kind of Author Avatar. Then it turns out that David is an in-universe fictional character who was written into existence by his landlady's ex-boyfriend.
-   In _The Master and Margarita_, the Master is a writer of a particularly un-Soviet persuasion, just like the author himself. And many antagonists/victims of demonic pranks are politically motivated literary critics, the same sort of people who made Bulgakov's life miserable.
-   In _The Trail of Cthulhu_, four of the six protagonists have professions relatives to writer. Shrewsbury, Clairborne Boyd, and Horvath Blayne are scientists focused on humanities (the former about occultism, the two latter about ethnology), Nayland Colum is a novelist. Indirectly, Andrew Phelan has been hired by Shrewsbury because he has some skills in a secretary job, among other things. The less relevant protagonist to this trope is Abel Keane, who is a theology student aiming to become a priest.
-   In Helen Cresswell's _The Bagthorpe Saga_, Mr Bagthorpe is a scriptwriter for The BBC.
-   The narrator's father in Jean Robinson's _The Strange But Wonderful Cosmic Awareness of Duffy Moon_ writes a cooking column under the name Grace Gallagher.
-   Yuri Zhivago of _Doctor Zhivago_ is an aspiring poet and novelist, something he seems to have been inspired to do by his uncle, Kolya Vedenyapin. Indeed, the third main plotline concerning his life, alongside his love life and his struggles in the midst of the Russian Revolution, is his striving to become a renowned writer.
-   Mary Higgins Clark's novels often feature female protagonists who are writers. A few examples: Sharon Martin (_A Stranger Is Watching_) is a newspaper columnist, Menley Nichols (_Remember Me_) writes children's books, and Jean Sheridan (_Nighttime Is My Time_) is a historical writer.
-   Writer Stephen Gordon, the protagonist of _The Well of Loneliness_, doubles as an Author Avatar.
-   Rhona, the protagonist of _A Harvest of War_ has written a shelf's worth of books.
-   Nicodemus, the narrator and protagonist of _The Letters From Nicodemus_, works as a writer of haggadas (parables or moral lessons).
-   The alien Paul in _Alien in a Small Town_ earns his living writing his observations about human culture from an outsider's point of view.
-   The lead character of _The Walker Papers_ is Joanne Walker, a mechanic turned shaman turned beat cop turned detective. She has an incongruous degree in English literature and nerds over language in-character.
-   Cody Lennox in "At First Just Ghostly" is an American writer visiting a London s-f/fantasy convention. He's burnt-out, drinks too much, and cannot come to grips with the loss of his wife.
-   The Protagonist and narrator of Debra Adelaide's novel _The Household Guide to Dying_ is an author of popular how-to books, the "household guides" to things including gardening and laundry. And when she finds out she is dying of metastatic cancer, she sets out to write her last book, the titular _Household Guide to Dying_.
-   The Protagonist of Andrew Nicoll's novel _The Love and Death of Caterina_ is one Luciano Hernando Valdez, a highly popular and respected writer from an unnamed Latin American country. The problem is that he is suffering from writer's block and all he has from his new novel is "a thin yellow cat crossed the road". And then he meets Caterina, a young student who admires him and also writes.
-   Philip Roth wrote a series of novels about Nathan Zuckerman, who, like Roth, is a famous Jewish-American novelist, who was born in 1933, grew up in Newark, and had his greatest success with a controversial, sexually explicit book.
-   Isaac Asimov:
    -   "The Dead Past": Nimmo is a science writer, and extols the virtues of such In-Universe. He takes the information from scientists, synthesizes it into a narrative, and creates explanations that non-specialized readers can follow. It affords him a broad basis of scientific understanding, rather than a narrow view. Isaac Asimov has shared that this is how he views himself, a Science writer more than a Science Fiction writer.
    -   "Galley Slave": Published in 1958, this story revolves around the work of a galley slave for a university. By this time, Dr Asimov had collaborated several times on creating university textbooks for publisher Walker And Wilkins, as well as being the sole author for several other nonfiction books on the subjects of physics and chemistry. The story goes into quite a bit of detail as the antagonist bringing a lawsuit against US Robotics is at risk of losing his reputation on the basis of the proofs created by EZ-27. Professor Ninheimer's rant at the end goes into detail about the joy of writing.
    -   "Hell-Fire (1956)": The story is told from the third-person limited/omniscient perspective, but the focus for most of it is Alvin Horner, a reporter from the _Continental Press_.
    -   "Kid Stuff": Jan Prentiss is a writer, like Dr Asimov, writing for a Bland-Name Product version of the same Pulp Magazine that printed this story.
    -   "Nightfall (1941)": Theremon 762 is a newspaper reporter who has come to the astronomy tower to report on the eclipse, and he's used as an audience proxy, providing someone the astronomers can explain things to.
-   An example with a dark twist: Winston Smith, the unassuming protagonist of _Nineteen Eighty-Four_, works as a writer for the Ministry of Truth, his specific job being to redact inconvenient news stories or incorrect predictions made by the ruling Party, and replace it with propaganda he is told to make up from whole cloth. He says that his writing is the high point of his life. His love interest, Julia, is also a writer, albeit of amateur pornographic novels and other tripe meant to keep the populace distracted and happy. Author George Orwell was a highly experienced writer, and was wearily self-aware about the nature of the literary world, and it shows best here. Orwell also worked for the BBC during WW2, and observed Britain's wartime propaganda broadcasting at first hand. In some respects, the Ministry of Truth is, pretty much exactly, the wartime BBC.
-   In the science fiction novel _The Night Mayor_, the protagonists, Susan Bishopric and Tom Tunney, are authors of computer-based interactive narratives, the closest thing to being a writer in a world where recreational reading has pretty much died out. Several scenes have Susan reflecting on aspects of the writer's life, such as dealing with the same old questions from fans and interviewers, and the annoyance of a key plot point being nullified by the march of science shortly after publication.
-   Sir Mark Turner from Courtney Milan's _Unclaimed_ is the Victorian moralist author of a popular treatise on chastity... whose interactions with his adoring fans sometimes have the comic ring of experience. "I'm not a saint. I'm not a holy man. I just wrote a book." "Your humility, sir—your good nature. Truly, you are an example to us all," Tolliver insisted.
-   The _Nikki Heat_ books (a Defictionalization of the Show Within a Show books from _Castle_) feature deuteragonist and Author Avatar Jameson Rook, who's a journalist rather than a novelist, but otherwise is a clear Self-Insert of Richard Castle.
-   _De Griezelbus_: The Big Bad Paul Onnoval is a horror author and something of A Darker Me of Paul van Loon himself, while several of Onnoval's In-Universe stories feature similar authors. One story goes for a bit of Self-Deprecation with an author who hires a secretary to handle all his fan mail, who turns out to be a demon that gives his fans a spell that turns them into monsters. In another one, a sinister author invites one of his fans to a fictional town where the creatures in his stories are allowed to live but cannot leave, before revealing that the fan is also fictional.
-   _Adrian Mole_ fancies himself as a writer, as well as a diarist. In his Stylistic Suck novel _Lo! The Flat Hills of my Homeland_, his protagonist Jake writes a novel _Sparg from Krong_, in which Sparg writes a novel _A Book with no Language_.
-   Margery Lawrence's _Miles Pennoyer_ mysteries are largely framed as accounts of cases solved by Pennoyer that are later relayed to his friend and personal chronicler Jerome Latimer. The character of Latimer introduces himself in the "foreword" of the first collection as a former solicitor and current writer of moderate success.
-   Taken to a new level by Ellery Queen, a mystery novelist whose main protagonist is a mystery novelist named Ellery Queen. Despite the direct connection, Ellery (the character) isn't an Author Avatar; Ellery the character is a well-spoken gentile writing while living off a large inheritence<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> , while Queen the pen name was a collaboration between two working class New York Jews; the connection was purely a marketing gimmick.
    -   Because Ellery Queen is popular in Japan, many popular Japanese writers have done the same pen name-protagonist connection, inluding Reito Nikaidou, Rintarou Norizuki, and Alice Arisugawa, who goes a step further by writing \*two\* series featuring writers named Alice Arisugawa, who are also the authors of each others' Mutually Fictional series, thus making them examples In-Universe as well.
-   _The Impossible Us_: We meet Nick as his career evolves from freelance editor to novelist (one published novel in his past notwithstanding), including a brief scene meeting his agent.
-   Carl Hiaasen has used this trope in a few of his novels.
    -   In his first solo novel, _Tourist Season_, Brian Keyes, the main character, is a former reporter turned Private Detective, while the Big Bad is an opinion writer for the same newspaper the main character used to work at.
    -   His fourth novel, _Native Tongue_, is about Joe Winder, a former newspaper reporter who is now writing PR for a theme park that serves as a Take That! towards Walt Disney World.
    -   In his sixth novel, _Stormy Weather_, two of the main characters, newlyweds (though not for long) Max and Bonnie Lamb work for a PR firm, and in her Back Story, we learn Bonnie was a journalism major who went into PR when she couldn't find much work in journalism.
    -   In his seventh novel _Lucky You_, Tom Krome, one of the main characters is a former investigative reporter now working for a small town newspaper who covers what seems like a fluff story - a part-time veterinarian's assistant wins the lottery - that turns into something more.
    -   His ninth novel, _Basket Case_, is about Jack Tagger, a former investigative reporter who has been banished to the obituary desk after insulting the new owner of the paper.
-   In _November 9_, dual protagonist Ben is a writer who aspires to get published someday. During their first meeting, Fallon challenges him to write a romance novel given he previously stated he had little interest in or experience with the genre, and he decides to write a story based upon his own relationship with Fallon. Also scattered throughout the novel are examples of Ben's poetry, where he discusses his inner thoughts and feelings.

-   The two main characters of _Spaced_ are Tim, an artist who wants to write his own comic book, and Daisy, a print author with no ideas.
-   Tv series _Get Shorty_ much like in the original Elmore Leonard novel and film of the same name, Much of the story is about getting funding for, and otherwise making a movie.
-   In _Just Shoot Me!_, everyone works for a magazine. The only one in the main cast who is a writer by profession is Maya, although Dennis has shown some writing prowess, penning (among other things) at least two screenplays, a few songs, an advice column, and most of his boss's "autobiography".
-   Rory of _Gilmore Girls_ is a journalist.
-   _Sex and the City_: Carrie is a newspaper columnist.
-   In both _Kolchak: The Night Stalker_ and its short-lived retool _Night Stalker_, Kolchak was a reporter.
-   Canadian channel TVO used to run a program called _Write On,_ which offered grammar lessons as short TV sketches. Yes, it's about as strange as it sounds, but the characters were journalists. You can view an episode here
-   _30 Rock_: Liz (TV writer) is an Author Avatar by Tina Fey's own admission.
-   Dennis Potter was a writer who suffered from severe psoriatic arthritis. His best-known work was the TV series (later made into a movie) _The Singing Detective_, about a writer who suffers from psoriatic arthritis. A difference is that the writer in the TV series wrote pulp detective fiction, while Potter mostly wrote rather surreal TV series.
-   The cast in _How I Met Your Mother_ aren't writers by trade, but they do enjoy spending _hours_ brainstorming sit-com joke lines. On top of that, Barney is a popular blogger, Marshall writes songs as a hobby, and Ted and Barney compose dueling poems in _The Sexless Innkeeper._
    -   Ted may be an architect, but he does love to wax douchey about literature and poetry.
-   During his retirement from the FBI, David Rossi of _Criminal Minds_ supported himself as an author and lecturer. Although he is a nonfiction writer similar to the real-life profiler John Douglas.

-   The father in _8 Simple Rules_ was a sports columnist.
-   Raymond, of _Everybody Loves Raymond_, is also a newspaper columnist.
-   The main protagonist of the show _Bored to Death_ is a struggling writer who even has the same name as the creator of the show (Jonathan Ames).
-   Jerry on _Seinfeld_ is, like his Real Life counterpart, a comedian; many episodes show Jerry struggling to write new material for his act. When, in the episode "The Pitch", he and George pitch a "show about nothing" to NBC execs, this is a direct parody of the creation of the show by the real Jerry and Larry David.
-   _Californication_: Hank Moody has written several novels and at least one screenplay (though he loathed the film adaptation), and is suffering from writer's block at the start of the series.
-   Gabrielle from _Xena: Warrior Princess_ may not have been a writer in the same way the others are, but as a bard and chronicler of Xena's adventures, it's probably as close as we get. There's even an episode about her writing a story about Xena. Virgil, Joxer's son, is a poet, much like his real-life namesake.
-   The first season of _Mad Men_ revealed that most of the men in Sterling-Cooper have secret novels or plays they are working on. When one of them manages to get his short story published, he earns the immediate envy and respect of everyone else in the office.
-   _The L.A. Complex_ was all about struggling young actors.
-   Kip and Henry from _Bosom Buddies_ worked in advertising. Henry was a copywriter (and Kip an artist). Henry believed their experiences living in drag would "make a great book."
-   In _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, the captain's son Jake starts working as a journalist and writing short stories and novels in his spare time by about the middle of the series.
    -   The episode "Shadowplay" has Ben Sisko's son Jake trying to work up the courage to tell his father he wants to be a writer instead of joining Starfleet. Ben accepts this once Jake finally tells him
    -   And in "The Muse" has a literal muse feeding off Jake writing. Creator Ron Moore even commented "...the notion of this exotic, beautiful, older woman who comes to you and gets excited by watching you write is like the most ridiculous idea! Only a writer would come up with that." Memory-alpha
    -   Also, in "Far Beyond the Stars", Sisko experiences some type of vision or hallucination of an alternate reality in which he is a writer for a science fiction magazine in the 1950s. Many of the other major characters are also writers or otherwise affiliated with the magazine. Rather ironically, one of the main characters whose alter ego is _not_ a writer is...Jake Sisko, the writer. (Likely this is because it was important to the story that "Benny Russell" be the only African-American on staff.)
-   In _Mama ist Unmöglich_, Mama is a popular mystery writer. She has friends in the police and sometimes runs into fans as well.
-   In _The Affair_, Noah has just published his first book when the story begins and is thinking about the second. His father-in-law Bruce Butler is a famous writer who remarks with contempt that everybody has a book in them, but almost no one has two.
-   Parodied and Played for Drama in _The X-Files_ episode "Milagro," where Mulder's next-door neighbor is a writer who's a self-indulgent, pretentious fantasist. But it turns sinister when he reveals he's writing a book in which Scully is his love interest and he moved next door to Mulder in order to see more of her.
-   _Masters of Horror_: The episode "Valerie on the Stairs", which is based on a Clive Barker short story, concerns a writer moving into a boarding house for struggling writers and coming face to face with characters who escaped from a Round Robin story written by the other residents. Finally, he realizes that he was also invented by the residents and ceases to exist when the story finishes, making it a case of a writer writing about writers writing about a writer.
-   _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_'s favourite subject is English, and she writes for the school paper, later majoring in journalism in college. One episode uniquely draws a distinction between journalism and fiction writing, as Sabrina struggles to give her stories good Character Development.
-   _Jane the Virgin_: Jane is an aspiring romance novel writer.
-   _Gossip Girl_'s Dan Humphrey is an aspiring writer.
-   _Party of Five_ makes one of Julia's main characteristics her love of writing. Given the sheer amount of drama in her day-to-day life, she's bound to have a lot to write about. She ends the series with a book deal.
-   _Once Upon a Time_ introduces August, who carries around a manual typewriter with him and claims to be in Storybrooke doing research. This is just a cover and he's actually a grown-up Pinocchio here to make Emma believe in herself again.
-   _Million Yen Women_: The protagonist Shin is a fiction writer.
-   _Get Shorty_: The story revolves around gangsters creating a film, with an emphasis on developing the screenplay. One of the gangsters gets credited as the screenwriter and is tasked with making changes to the script, even though he's really not a writer.
-   _The Secret Life of Us_: The original main character, Evan Wilde, is a novelist who manages to get published early in the second season.
-   _Madam Secretary_: Liz's sole official act as acting president in the season 2 premiere is to pardon a journalist imprisoned for defying a court order to give up her source (prompted by her son doing a school project on the journalist).
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: Elrond is a scholar and was introduced writing a speech for Gil-galad.

    Music 

-   Referenced in the song "Paperback Writer" by The Beatles, in which a man who wants to be a paperback writer has written a book about a man who wants to be a paperback writer.

    Theatre 

-   _Trixie True Teen Detective_ has Joe Sneed, a writer who wants to write hard-boiled detective novels, but is stuck working in a syndicate stable writing perky-girl-detective stories instead.
-   The Musical of _Little Women_ uses this, of course, following the book, but it's amusingly evident when Jo, in the song "Weekly Volcano Press," supposedly reading aloud her story, reads something that sounds more like a script for a _musical_ ("The forest is dark and spooky. Clarissa enters, her clothes in disarray...") than a past-tense short story normally would.
-   Mark from _RENT_ is a would-be filmmaker who has written a few screenplays (which he burns). His friend Roger spends the musical singing about how he wants to write a song.
-   The protagonist of _City of Angels_ is a writer trying to adapt his novel into a Film Noir. The antagonist is a meddling executive.
-   Occurs twice in the canon of Stephen Sondheim: the Broadway songwriting team of Franklin Shepard and Charley Kringas in _Merrily We Roll Along_, whilst both Georges in _Sunday in the Park with George_ are artists who struggle to be understood and accepted by their peers, much like Sondheim himself.
-   Cliff Bradshaw in _Cabaret_ — naturally enough, because the show ultimately derives from novelist Christopher Isherwood's memoirs kept while he was living in Weimar Berlin.
-   In _Fly by Night_ almost all the characters have some connection to musical theatre and/or songs. Harold is a songwriter and a guitarist, his father is an opera enthusiast, Daphne is a singer/actress, and Joey Storms is a Broadway playwright.
-   _The Seagull_ starts with Konstantin trying to impress his mother with a play he wrote and directed. His failure drives the rest of the play.
-   _My Sister Eileen_ and its musical adaptation _Wonderful Town_ have the aspiring young writer Ruth Sherwood, based, of course, on the Ruth McKenney who wrote the non-fictional stories which inspired the play.
-   The Framing Device of _Man of La Mancha_ has Miguel de Cervantes himself having to make up parts of his story of Don Quixote as he goes along.
-   Andrew from _Sleuth_ has become wealthy as a successful writer of popular, though now old-fashioned, crime fiction novels, which feature an aristocratic amateur detective, St. John Lord Merridew.

    Video Games 

-   Alan Wake is a Stephen King\-esque writer who gets caught up in a scenario similar to his books. _Penny Arcade_ explains.
    -   The game also has a more direct invocation of this trope by having a character that's a game developer (who's in an insane asylum... with some pretty fun dialog). Interestingly, this happens very rarely in video games which seems to imply that video games seem to be one of the media that bucks the trend. Why this is is another question.
    -   The books Alan is famous for are noir-inspired crime thrillers that are basically _Max Payne_, Remedy's previous series. They even have the same voice actor playing the character during voice-over "excerpts" of the books. A reader of Alan's says he's "a little heavy on the metaphors", which is the previous games' best-known feature.
-   Interestingly, _Catherine_ is a video game where the protagonist is a video game designer.
    -   And for a bonus, romantic fidelity is big part of the story.
-   _Comix Zone_ is about a comic book writer whose Big Bad managed to trap him inside his own comic book.
-   The title character in the Dana Knightstone series is a historical novelist.
-   The protagonist from the _Dark Seed_ games is a writer.
-   Varric Tethras from _Dragon Age II_ and _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ writes books on the side, which are often thinly veiled retellings of his friends' adventures. The Framing Device in _II_ is his telling a story about Hawke, and a side quest in _Inquisition_ is about tracking down the last chapter of his attempt at a Romance Novel.
-   The _Dead Reckoning_ series of hidden object games from Eipix Entertainment usually has a writer of some sort as the player character. For example, in _Sleight of Murder,_ the protagonist is a screenwriter, while in _Death Between the Lines_ they're a novelist.
-   _Fatal Frame_:
    -   _The first game_ has Junsei Takamine, who enters the cursed Himuro mansion for the sake of research for his next book. It ends horribly for him.
    -   Kei Amakura from _The Tormented_ is a non-fiction writer.
    -   _The fifth game_ has Ren Hojo, an anthor who heads into Mt. Hikami after coming across a photograph of a young girl he keeps seeing in his dreams.
    -   The main character in _Manor Memoirs_ is a writer having difficulties with her latest book.
-   The titular character of the _Gabriel Knight_ series writes supernatural mysteries which are "loosely based" on his own experiences.
-   Adrienne Delaney from _Phantasmagoria_ is a best-selling novelist, particularly well known for her book _Blue Moon Rising_.
-   The only named protagonist of _History Civil War: Secret Missions_, Edward “Eric” Hogger, aspires to become a writer before the Civil War. The back-up short story of the game details possibly a page from Eric’s diary.
-   The protagonist of _Scratches_, Michael Arthate, is a rising horror writer; In _Last Visit_ the protagonist is an unnamed reporter.
-   _Segagaga_ is about running Sega as a company, producing and distributing games. Played with, however, as the characters in the company's games are real and help with development (Amigo from _Samba de Amigo_ is a high-level programmer, for instance), the development process itself plays out like a normal video game, and past SEGA systems are actually spaceship-like weapons.
-   Harry Mason from _Silent Hill_. Possibly not a very good one.
-   _Tokyo Tattoo Girls_ was developed by a subsidiary of the Nikkatsu movie company, and one of its main protagonists is Chocho Choufu, an aspiring actress that adores the types of movies Nikkatsu creates.
-   _Toonstruck_ stars the aptly named Drew Blanc, a struggling cartoonist.
-   Gets VERY meta in _Umineko: When They Cry_. The games are, in fact, an IN-STORY novel, written by...THE CULPRIT, who in one scene in the manga version, is shown becoming the Witch Beatrice, as she realizes she can move people around like pawns on a gameboard. Though, 3-6 are written by a different person...who is also one of the main characters.
-   The character _OMORI_ from the video game title of the same name is a teenager with a penchant for writing and doodling. He literally has a book where he jots down his observations of his foes in a rather creative, yet dark way. He even has a skill where he can make an enemy sad with the use of a sad poem. This is a holdover from his original appearance in the _Omoriboy_ comics, where he owned and wrote a blog in addition to his usual writing and drawing.

    Webcomics 

-   Slick from _Sinfest_ is sometimes seen trying to write a literary masterpiece. He also does poetry slams in the earlier strips.
-   Davan of _Something\*Positive_ is, for a time, the writer of a webcomic. He also has a regular job as the personal assistant of a theatrical producer; this job on occasion makes use of his writing skills, such as when he has to rewrite a show's script.
-   The Shakespeare character in _Irregular Webcomic!_ works in an office doing some sort of writing, and writes _Harry Potter_ Fan Fiction on the side.
    -   Well, he is William Shakespeare, you know.
-   Lynda Levac of _Penny and Aggie_ is a columnist for a parenting website.
-   David in _Living with Insanity_.
-   In the modern arc of _Arthur, King of Time and Space_, Arthur writes a webcomic, as did Merlin until his death.
-   Parson Gotti, the protagonist (See what they did there?) of _Erfworld_, has a webcomic of his own (kinda), hamstard.com. He's also a strategy gamer in what amounts to a world built on strategy game tropes.
-   Doc Rat has a minor character who makes comics.
-   Two of the five main characters of _morphE_ are writers. Tyler Dawn is an English major who was trying to get published and Asia Ellis is a reporter.
-   Gary, one of the lead trio of _Ménage à 3_, is a wannabe comics artist. In addition, Yuki, a major secondary character, is a wannabe comics writer (and the daughter of a manga creator), and sometimes collaborates with Gary. On top of that, Yuki, plus lead character Zii and secondary character Sonya, are in a band — and the comic's co-writer Gisèle Lagacé used to be a professional musician. (Sonya, the band's bass player, even looks a bit like Giz, who played bass.)
-   The protagonist of _Can't See Can't Hear But Love_, Geun Soo, is a comic artist forced to quit after he starts going blind.

    Web Original 

-   A _Cracked_ article discusses how Hollywood films get other professions wrong by extrapolating from the experiences of Hollywood writers: 6 Things Movies Love to Get Wrong About the Workplace.
-   The Icebox Radio Theatre is based out of the small town of International Falls, Minnesota. Their biggest show is _Radio Icebox_, a comedy-drama about a radio station set in the small town of Icebox, Minnesota, starring — among others — the creator of IBRT, Jeff Adams, as JJ, the station manager. The other show is _Scoop Sisters Mysteries_, about women running a paper in the small town of Icebox, Minnesota, who keep stumbling into mysteries. This seems to be a different Icebox from _Radio Icebox_, as are all the other shorts they keep making<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
    -   Both series have made a point about how hard it is to run such old media (radio theatre and print newspapers, respectively) in this high-tech, fast-paced, get it done yesterday world. IBRT doesn't have the benefit of the strange meteor in the lake that blocks outside radio and TV signals (and attracts weirdness). Presumably.
-   Not writers, but the cast of Marble Hornets is mostly made of film students.
-   _WitchCraft SMP_: Like her content creator counterpart, El documents her experiences in the competition to become Supreme Witch in the form of videos which she shares with others. In the epilogue, she finds her calling in content creation, and uses her illusion magic to manipulate the algorithm and make herself world-famous.

    Western Animation 

-   Andy French of _Mission Hill_ works at a mattress store, but he's an aspiring cartoonist. At least one episode deals with his discouragement over all the rejections he's gotten sending his comics to various magazines.
-   Ginger Foutley of _As Told by Ginger_ was a writer. The show specified that she was a gifted poet, but it was inferred that she was an all-around talented writer. She starts writing songs as she gets older.
-   Mikey on _Recess_ is a writer of epic poetry.
-   _Rugrats_ - Susie's father Randy is a writer for the Dummy Bears TV show in-universe.
-   _Doug_ is a writer and cartoonist; in fact, many episodes open and close with him writing in his journal.
-   _Daria_ is a talented writer, while her best friend Jane is an artist.
-   Brian from _Family Guy_ writes as a hobby, although he's not very good.
-   _BoJack Horseman_ creator Raphael Bob Waksberg noted this in an interview, observing that the show spent a lot of time satirising the production and acting sides of Hollywood but not much of the writers and that as a result, it could come across a little self-congratulatory. Therefore in season five, they introduced the character of Flip, the creator of a gritty prestige drama who is totally convinced of his own tortured genius despite most of his scripts coming out nonsensical. In a more traditional version of this trope, Diane is a genuinely earnest and capable writer.

...Wait, so if _most_ writers are writers, does that mean there's some writers who _aren't_ writers?
