He's Luke Skywalker. He's here to rescue you.

_"He will face the fiercest foe  
when another needs his aid,  
He will dare to defy Death  
even though he is afraid,  
He works not just for glory  
and he does it not for gain,  
But because he knows that others  
will be spared a greater pain."_

The Hero is a character who overcomes adversity and challenges by performing great acts that demonstrate their strength (physical or mental), ingenuity, and valor. In modern works, heroes are also often the primary source of goodness in the story or will fight on its behalf against a Big Bad. In contrast, heroes of classical works frequently engaged in heroics to protect their honor, pride, and vanity, as past societies put much stock into such values. In this classical conception, being The Hero was more about accomplishing some great feat against a worthy opponent, rather than upholding and protecting some noble intention.

While The Hero is often The Protagonist and The Leader, these tropes are not the same. The Protagonist is the principal character of the story who drives the plot forward. The Hero tends to be The Protagonist (see Hero Protagonist) just because baked into the hero's definition is a forward-moving, basic narrative structure (hero faces some challenge and has to figure out a way to overcome it). The Leader, on the other hand, is simply a character who sits at the head of some group or organization. Often times The Hero will be The Leader because idealized versions of The Hero and The Leader share many of the same traits (strong, resilient, righteous, noble, proactive, morally upstanding, well-liked, charismatic, confident, brave, etc.), making The Hero a logical choice in the narrative to also be The Leader. That said, not all heroes are The Leader and not every example of The Leader is also The Hero.
