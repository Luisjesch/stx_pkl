_"You and your group of nerds fall into a pit and it's full of dynamite and you blow up. The end."_

This is what happens in Tabletop RPGs when the Game Master gets utterly fed up with the players: he kills them _all_ spectacularly. It is essentially the GM deciding to take his ball and go home.

Precisely what drives a GM to this extreme varies. Perhaps somebody was a Rules Lawyer once too often. Perhaps the gaming group mocked his plotting skills a bit too much. The players might have spent all their time going everywhere but where the plot wants them to. Maybe the group consisted entirely of Munchkins. Maybe they didn't like that "totally awesome" GMPC as much as the GM did and tried to kill him in his sleep. Or maybe the players are just Too Dumb to Live. Or maybe, just maybe, the GM is a sadistic bastard who's determined to see the players fail _at any cost_.

Regardless of the cause, if the GM goes as far as Rocks Fall Everyone Dies, the campaign has failed on a grand scale. Maybe it's time to stop the metagaming, let somebody else GM, or just find a new gaming group altogether.

A lesser form of this trope can target just one particularly annoying player, often with a bolt of lightning. Since the GM is the local god, this works even if the target character is underground, in a Faraday cage, wearing a static discharge bracelet. Merely threatening players with lightning can also be effective in controlling players. The first edition _Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Masters' Guide_ even suggested using "blue bolts from the heavens" and "ethereal mummies" on PCs to keep their players in line.

The webcomic _Something\*Positive_ provides the Trope Namer in this strip. The underlying concept stretches back to the beginning of Tabletop RPGs, having been seen in the extremely deadly AD&D adventure _Tomb of Horrors_ in 1975 (and quite likely used by individual DMs even before that). This ending is a Tabletop Games form of Shoot the Shaggy Dog, or "Everybody Dies" Ending when premeditated. A subtrope of Total Party Kill. When the players decide to detonate the game instead of the GM, it's Off the Rails. A nigh-unbeatable Beef Gate used this way is sometimes referred to as a "Grudge Monster" or "Grudge NPC." Compare to Dropped a Bridge on Him for generally abrupt, unceremonious deaths.

Not to be confused with Big Rock Ending.

**NOTE: This is not just a trope for everyone in a story dying. That is "Everybody Dies" Ending.**

**Also, do not add examples about the extinction of the dinosaurs. Although their extinction likely involved literal rocks falling from space, they are not a part of this trope. They too fall under "Everybody Dies" Ending.**

    Anime and Manga 

-   Early in _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, Yami Bakura was an evil dungeon master whose goal was to steal his players' souls. When the series' protagonist managed to nearly beat him, he attempted to self-destruct and kill EVERYBODY. (The RPG allowed less freedom of rock-falling since it's played on a set game board.)

    Comic Books 

-   B.A. from _Knights of the Dinner Table_ finds himself forced to do this to his players constantly, just to keep them in line—two are dedicated Hack and Slash types, another is a Rules Lawyer.
    -   Every GM who isn't Patty Gauzwieler will pull this at one point or another in the comic. The most infamous is Weird Pete's Temple of Horrendous Doom, an obvious jab at the Tomb of Horrors. Actually subverted when they play the Temple of Horrendous Doom - everyone dies, yes, but that's just the start of the adventure.
    -   One nice storyline, after the group pulled off some particularly annoying feat of munchkinry, rather than declaring a RFED, B.A. manipulates the characters that the same players play in his _other_, science fiction campaign, into nuking his fantasy world (and thus, their fantasy characters) into oblivion.
    -   Averted when Weird Pete gets into a battle of wills with Sara over whether he can manage to kill off her player-character. After he arbitrarily declares the entire dungeon falls on her PC, Sara simply invokes a magical debt to survive it and then uses class level skills to begin digging her way out. When Bob asks Brian, "So who's losing?", Brian answers, "The architecture."
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: In the Farasian Shores arc, there's a flashback where Zecora tried to play Ogres & Oubliettes with her friends, but they wouldn't stop arguing, so she ended the game by saying that their characters all died in the desert.

    Comic Strips 

-   Jason does this to Paige in one _FoxTrot_ strip, purely to annoy her. After a week's worth of strips setting up the game, Jason causes the cave to collapse and kill the entire party after Paige's _very first turn_.
    
    **Jason**: Your bodies will remain undiscovered for... \*roll roll roll\*... 82 centuries!
    
    -   This could also be a reference to the classical adventure _Tomb of Horrors_ where, yes, the very first door in the beginning paragraph has a collapsing trap that can kill you.
-   In a _Calvin and Hobbes_ strip Calvin initiates a Derailed Fairy Tale in the story his father is reading, so Dad just has the tiger eat everybody to end the story.
    -   In another strip, Dad gets sick of always reading the same story to Calvin at bedtime, so he decides to tweak it a bit. One Gilligan Cut later, and Hobbes is wondering if the villagers will ever find Hamster Huey's head...

    Fanfiction 

-   A deliciously silly _Dragon Age: Origins_ fic on the now closed BioWare boards had Alistair as DM resort to this after a staggering amount of player stupidity from Morrigan, Sten, Wynne, and Oghren. "Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies" was actually the title.
-   In the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fic Ponies Play D&D, Spike gets fed up with the group's constant arguing over every decision they come across. When Rainbow Dash attempts to slaughter the archangel NPC about to spell out the party's next objective, his patience snaps and he traps the party in a cave with a massively overpowered Stone Ogre. Applejack unwittingly averts a Total Party Kill by rolling a timely nat 20 and decapitating the Ogre in one blow.
-   River mentions this trope by name in the _Firefly_ fic, _Forward_, when she's captured on Persephone and brought before Ornstintz, after intending to kill him. During her interrogation, when he comments on her foolishness for thinking she could come alone and kill him, she casually rattles off the names of several asteroids in unstable orbits she could have _very_ easily destabilized and targeted him with.
    
    **River**: Rocks fall, everyone dies.
    
-   _Knowledge is Power_: This is literally how the author kills off the cast in the original timeline.
-   Amastroph's _Nuzlocke Comics_ spinoff ends with his sociopathic Kricketune slaughtering the entire cast ("which went well, by the way") and becoming a God of Evil Genosect, explicitly due to boredom with the story.
-   How Bajoran ex-NCO Kanril Eleya's run at the Kobayashi Maru scenario turns out in "The Universe Doesn't Cheat". Eleya attempted Xanatos Speed Chess against the computer, initially looking like she was going to try to talk her way out but instead planning to shoot her way clear, and then repeatedly changing her tactics when the computer tried to compensate. The computer finally gave up all pretense of pretending to be a fair test and spawned a Klingon battleship in a weapons blind spot to "kill" her (which just got her mad at the instructors).

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Towards the end of _The Fall_, Roy tries to end the story he's telling by killing off the characters in brutal ways. Alexandria objects and starts taking control of the story by stepping into it.
-   Mission Control attempts to do this in _Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over_ by spawning a powerful lava monster when they realize that the Big Bad is Railroading the party. It doesn't work because falling into the lava is harmless.

    Folklore 

-   A story passed around since the 1980s now about a GM who killed a player character because of his player's architectural ignorance: Not knowing what a "gazebo" was, the player decided to _attack_ it rather than, say, _ask_ what it was. After numerous attacks with no effect, the player decided to leave, at which point the GM announced, "It's too late. You have awakened the gazebo. It catches you and eats you." <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
    -   The story appeared in a mid-1980s _Mensa Bulletin_ newsletter, so it's at least Older Than the NES.
    -   This story was widely popularized in the gaming community by the comic _Knights of the Dinner Table._
    -   Referenced in the Steve Jackson card game _Munchkin_, where a Gazebo really is an enemy monster that players may encounter. A rather scary one, too. And if you try to run away from it and fail, it really will pounce and kill you.
    
    "You must face the Gazebo—ALONE."
    
    -   Also referenced in _Nodwick_ at one point; in one of the last few issues, a gazebo was the location of a fault in space-time which an evil god planned to exploit.
    -   The comical _D&D_ supplement _Portable Hole Full of Beer_ actually includes monster stats for "The Dread Gazebo".
    -   As well as in the _Order of the Stick_ board game, where you can accidentally land on the Gazebo and wake it up, if you're not careful.
    -   Also referenced in _Dungeons & Dragons Online_.
-   A similar story<small>◊</small> was provided by a demotivator: after a wizard forgot what a "gong" was and began hurling magic missiles at one (sample dialogue: "A sonic attack! Quick, everyone, cover your ears!"); the DM responds, "OK, while you're distracted the door sneaks up behind you and slits your throat."
-   One story tells of a player who was annoyed by the DM, the Dungeonmaster's Girlfriend, the DM's and his girlfriend's characters and possibly the whole campaign and contrived to covertly gather massive quantities of explosives using innocuous ingredients including barrels of stale urine. Using some advanced chemistry and geometry knowledge, the player managed to turn the city in the valley where the player party as well as every NPC of note stood into a crater, _forcing_ the DM to say "Rocks fall, everyone dies."
-   One story that gained some fame tells about a campaign focusing on a group of heroes trying to find and defeat a Lich before he can raise an undead army. They arrive at a kingdom and decide to prode on anything they can, including their stance on homosexuality. The DM says that, while homosexuality isn't forbidden, gay marriage isn't allowed. The group suddenly decides they want to change the direction of the story into overthrowing the ruler of the kingdom and establishing a democracy and they finally convince the DM to follow this thread. When the group finally overthrows the goverment, the Lich arrives with his now massive undead army and proceeds to destroy the kingdom and everyone in it. The end.

    Literature 

-   Used as a plot point in _Bimbos of the Death Sun_. After Appin Dungannon<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is murdered at a sci-fi convention, protagonist Jay Omega (another guest author) takes over the "Celebrity _D&D_" and uses it as part of a plan to expose the murderer. During the game, he hits Runewind with a Humiliation Conga that ends with his getting curb-stomped and killed; this causes the Loony Fan to flip out and attack Jay. He confesses that he's trying to save Runewind "again" — he broke into Dungannon's hotel room, saw a chapter where he was planning on killing off Runewind (only not really), and shot the author in order to "save" the character.
-   Robert Fulghum describes telling a story to his children. He thought he had finished conclusively and the kids were asleep, only to hear them ask for "the rest of the story." He would resort to apocalypse. "Suddenly a comet hit the earth and blew everything to pieces." A moment of silence, and someone would ask "What happened to the pieces?"
-   Happens in _Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules_, where Susan forces Greg to play _Magicik and Monsters_ with Rodrick. (Long story.) Greg is prepared for the worst game-session of all time, when Rodrick, who happens to be player AND GM in this session, just decides that all the adventurers fall into a hole filled with dynamite and die in the very first turn. Greg is relieved.
-   In "How to Write Good," a humorous essay by Michael O'Donoghue of _Saturday Night Live_ and _National Lampoon_ Magazine fame, the author advises the aspiring writer that if he is having trouble finding a suitable way to close out his story, he should simply end it with "Suddenly, everyone was run over by a truck. -the end-". There are a few caveats: If writing a story set in England, it should end with "Suddenly, everyone was run over by a lorry. -the end-". If set in France, "Soudainement, tout le monde etait écrasé par un camion. -finis-". If writing a story about ants, "Suddenly, everyone was run over by a centipede. -the end-". "In fact," O'Donoghue says, "this is the only ending you need ever use." In a footnote, he cautions: "If you are writing a story about trucks, _do not_ have the trucks run over by a truck. Have the trucks run over by a _mammoth_ truck." And the entire essay ends in a Call-Back, with "There are many more writing tips I could share with you, but suddenly I am run over by a truck. -the end-".
-   _The Years of Rice and Salt_: All the characters we have been following through one incarnation end up in a Tibetan mountain village, which is wiped out by an avalanche. However we will meet them again in different reincarnations, or waiting in the bureaucratic hells for their next assignments.
-   The William S. Burroughs short story "Ali's Smile" ends with a slag heap collapsing on the town, killing everyone.
-   In the _Star Trek Expanded Universe_, Montgomery Scott dealt with the Kobayashi Maru scenario by attempting a technobabble trick that worked on paper and therefore apparently so within the simulator, but not in reality. The computer retaliated by spawning more Klingon warships than existed in the entire Empire at the time. As for Starfleet Academy, they pretty much went "ha ha, very funny" and transferred Scotty away from command track to engineering, which was what he wanted all along.
-   _Games Night_ by Johnny Nexus (about a TTRPG played by a group of gods and how this affects the lives of the mortal characters) ends this way quite literally. The Allfather announces the end by having rocks fall on all the mortal characters because the other gods are getting restless, bored or just hate his out of nowhere twist about the world the mortals live in.
-   In _The Devil's Dictionary_, Ambrose Bierce relates the story of a pair of writers working together on a Round Robin, only to begin suffering from severe Creative Differences and squabbling incessantly. Eventually, one of the writers gets fed up with it all and writes a chapter in which the entire cast dies horribly in a shipwreck then quits, leaving his former partner to sort the mess out alone.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Frasier_. In a variation on this, Niles got so upset at Frasier's over-directing a radio play in "Ham Radio", he decided to take action.
    
    **Niles:** Okay, that's it. Never mind all that. I'm just going to take this gun off the table. _(fake gunshot)_ Sorry about that, O'Toole; I guess we'll never hear your fascinating piece of the puzzle. _(two fake gunshots)_ Or yours, Kragan and Peppo! Could the McCallister sisters stand back to back? I'm short on bullets. _(fake gunshot)_ Thank you. _(to Roz)_ What was your name again, dear?  
    **Roz:** Mithuth Thorndyke.  
    **Niles:** Thank you. _(fake gunshot)_ Oh, and also Mr. Wing. _(fake gunshot, and sound of muted bell on Mr. Wing's hat)_ And, of course, one final bullet for myself, so the mystery will die with me. _(fake gunshot. Niles taunts Frasier)_ HA.
    

    Manhua 

-   The previous DM in _Infinity Game_ did this to his world by wiping out everybody except D.D./Trishia, an NPC, but mostly because he was insane and bored. This killed the players, who were in the game at the same time, in real life.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Deliberatly invoked, and summoned by name, in "Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies", a one-shot by creator Friv Yeti: "a game that is likely to be 95% character creation and 5% actual play time", for people who like character creation and worldbuilding better than actually playing.
-   Steve Jackson Games's _Toon_ actually has a table of 'Apocalyptic Big Finishes' in the back of the _Toon Ace Catalog_ sourcebook, for when the characters don't quite make it to the end and you need a quick way to end things. Of course, no-one dies, but the principle's the same.
    -   Steve Jackson Games's _Munchkin_ card game features a card that's actually called Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies. It can cause every player in the game to be killed if played at the right time. It was illustrated by the Trope Namer, too.
-   _The Apocalypse Stone_ was a Second Edition _Dungeons & Dragons_ module deliberately designed for DMs that wanted to do this, in preparation for starting over with Third Edition. In it, the players steal a MacGuffin that triggers the end of the world. They can undertake quests to prove they are worthy to die heroically, but in the canonical ending, can't really do anything to prevent the world from imploding. However, the book included several cop-out scenarios to save things at the last minute in case the DM gets cold feet (or is being threatened with death himself…)
-   In the _Call of Cthulhu_ boardgame _Arkham Horror_, the players race to seal gates opening in the town of Arkham before a Great Old One (randomly decided at the start of the game) awakens and they have to fight it, which is difficult but (sometimes) possible to win. If the Great Old One threatening to awaken is Azathoth, however, the players _automatically and instantly lose_ if he awakens, as his first "attack" is to _destroy the world_.
-   _F.A.T.A.L._ has for the highest level caster _job_ the spell F.A.T.A.L., which kills everything on whichever planet the game is set... obviously including the caster and his fellow party members. It's also possible to cast this _by accident_ if you make a bad roll on the spell-fumble chart. Considering the rest of the game, this is arguably the Golden Ending.
-   This is the typical ending of many _Paranoia_ missions where the players have somehow managed against all odds to squeak through with some of their backup clones intact. Actually, speaking of those clones, sometimes this is how the mission _starts_.
-   Cheating in Pinball. This causes the TILT message to appear, ends the current chance immediately, and permits the ball to drain without further play. Some machines even take this to the next step by _completely locking down_ and requiring the owner to manually restart the machine with a code or specialized key before playing can resume; others simply have the game lock down for a set amount of time, after which it will reset. OF course, this is not always a retaliation to cheating attempts; for more advanced pinball machines that have delicate mechanics and electronics, the TILT function also serves to protect said mechanics by locking them into a safe position in the event that the machine were inadvertently toppled or bumped by an impact.
-   TSR's _Tomb of Horrors_ ran with this trope with a vengeance. Of the potential entrances into the Tomb, at least one will drop a ceiling on you and your party. Before even actually getting into the dungeon proper. And it's not even the worst trap by a long shot.
-   In _Werewolf (1997)_, a merciful moderator will usually have himself be the first night's victim just to keep the game going for the players. However, if they choose, they will be part of the game, with the "Moderator" card. Per the rules of the game, their card is kept hidden just like everyone else. Should a majority vote be cast to lynch the moderator, it is within the moderator's authority to kill off everyone who voted to lynch him.
-   In _Planescape_, this is actually one of the _purposes_ of the Lady of Pain. As her in-universe "job" is essentially keeping Sigil ticking along by rendering anyone who screws over the city as a whole Deader than Dead, dungeon masters are told to go right ahead and use her to kill off any players they feel are being campaign-wreckingly disruptive. A willingness to abuse this aspect of her is one of the reasons why Planescape _players_ tend to feel less fondly of her than dungeon masters do.
-   _Dark Heresy_ and its sister games, given the nature of its universe, when the events of campaign aren't already trying to cause a Total Party Kill, has a particularly long list of ways the Game Master can plausibly deal with player characters/parties/entire planets that have screwed up in spectacular fashion. This also includes having "(Ork) Roks fall, Ork Waaaaagh!, Everyone Dies".
-   If you stand in the way of the The God-Machine from _Demon: The Descent_, it will start taking actions against you. If you successfully resist its attempts on your life, it will consider you not worth its resources and move on. If you keep on causing troubles for it and actually becoming a threat, it will pull all the stops and dump this trope on your head.
-   In the _Dungeons & Dragons_ sourcebook _Elder Evils_, a group of wizards tried summoning Pandorym, an Eldritch Abomination, so they could threaten the gods themselves. The gods smote them for their insolence.

    Video Games 

-   The AI in _AI Dungeon 2_ can be quite the temperamental GM at times, with seemingly random actions leading to the player characters' death. Notably, this rarely ever results in an actual Game Over, with the story sometimes continuing onward as if the player dying never happened.
-   _PlanetSide_ was shut down with this trope, with the final moments before the servers were taken offline highlighted by meteor showers killing everyone still connected.
-   If _NetHack_ encounters a fatal bug, the last messages it gives you are "Oops...", followed by "Suddenly, the dungeon collapses."
-   The above example can be found in _Crypt Of The Necrodancer_: Some characters have exclusive weapons that prevent you from picking up any other type of weapon, and attempting to ditch them by certain exploits in hopes of obtaining a more convenient one will have you instantly die for "cowardice".
-   This is the preferred method among MMOs for closing up beta test servers, though generally with a bit more variety than rocks. This can range from giant demon invasions to UFO attacks to legions of fire-wielding little girls.
-   In _Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn_, the game summons Arkanis Gath to immediately One-Hit Kill you if you attack any characters that are necessary to advance the plot. This is basically a way to prevent players from getting stuck if they kill someone who prevents them from advancing the plot. In the original, of course, doing that causes them to be replaced by Biff the Understudy.
-   In the 550-point and 580-point versions of _Colossal Cave_, you are warned not to use a particular magic word near water. If you ignore that warning, the most likely result is that you will turn into a jellyfish and die; but there's a small chance that the entire dungeon will collapse on you, your extra lives will be revoked, and you'll be summarily ejected from the game.
-   _Shin Megami Tensei_:
    -   _Persona 3_'s Superboss has some very specific (if unwritten) rules about the kinds of Persona and attacks you can and can't use. If any of these rules are broken, the boss will heal themselves back to maximum, then use Megidolaon to hit you for 9999 damage, killing you instantly.
    -   Later games in the series aren't as strict with the rules for the bonus boss, but they all share one: don't use the Omnipotent Orb, an accessory which nulls all damage except for Almighty. Megidolaon does Almighty damage. Guess what your punishment for using the Orb is.
    -   _Persona 5_:
        -   The Bonus Boss in _Persona 5_ does not punish you from using the Omnipotent Orb, but if you take too much turns to reasonably hurt them, they will All-out attack you and end the battle instantly without fail.
        -   In _Royal_, during January, the Bonus Boss, which is the complete form of the aforementioned bonus boss, will do the same if you don't damage her by 5000 HP within 9 turns, with her second and third trials also requiring Technical Damage and Critical Damage **every turn**. And yes, she _can_ All-out attack even if she's just one enemy. Furthermore, if you drop her HP to 25% or below, every 6 turns she will use Concentrate, then cast a Megidolaon doing around 2700 damage on average, unguarded. It's survivable if you are lucky, however.
        -   While it's fairly difficult to trigger, the True Final Boss of _Royal_ will cast a Megidolaon doing around 1300 damage (Which almost always equates to instant death) if you take too much turns trying to kill them. A similar instance happens during Cognitive Wakaba's battle much earlier on.
        -   A non-gameplay example happens when the Big Bad starts rolling his control plan out for real. It starts by Tokyo begins to merge with Mementos to form the Qliphoth World, followed by your entire party being wiped out from existence while writhing in pain. It turns out that the Big Bad, also known as the Holy Grail, had manipulated the public so they think that the Phantom Thieves do not exist. And not only the Holy Grail is the kickstarter of _everything_, your whole journey up to this point is a game for him...and a game that only he can win.
    -   The ultimate bonus boss of _Digital Devil Saga_ will instant-kill your entire party with a Gaea Rage that does at least 4 digits of damage if you go into battle with any immunities or throw up any immunities in mid-battle. A boss of similar class in _Digital Devil Saga 2_ does the same, but with the _slight_ mercy of simply removing immunities instead of ending the battle before it even starts if you start the battle with immunities.
-   The _Star Wars_\-based MUD _Legends of the Jedi_ once used a Chiss invasion to kill off the galaxy during its annual timeline reset. In this case, though, the admins did it because they wanted to do something interesting instead of just having everyone's characters vanish into the night.
    -   Note that a Chiss invasion is something just as logical as rocks falling out of the blue and killing everything. This race practices martial pacifism according to all canon sources.
-   The ending to the original campaign for _Neverwinter Nights 2_ seems to be a sort of homage to this trope; after you kill the Final Boss, the temple collapses, killing over half your party (Casavir, Elanee, Grobnar, the Construct, Bishop, Qara, and _maybe_ Zhjaeve, for those curious, though before the expansions it was implied to be a Total Party Kill) and causing the Player Character to disappear, never to be seen again. (In this case, "never" lasted as long as it took the developers to make an expansion pack.) Being a _Dungeons & Dragons_ game, it's exactly the kind of ending a Trolling Creator would design.
-   In _Borderlands 2_, the beginning of the D&D-themed DLC _Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep_ has Tina doing this at the beginning of her campaign, where she introduces a dragon that can't be damaged and downs you with a single attack. She's then told by Lilith that killing the party is bad DM etiquette, at which point Tina revives the player and replaces the dragon with a random skeleton.
-   Piss off the Kami of _Ryzom_ by harvesting materials from an area for too long, and you and everyone around you will get hit (and killed) by the full brunt of their wrath.
-   Although the trope is usually averted in the _Dragon Age_ series, it's invoked by name in the first story DLC for _Dragon Age: Inquisition._ In _Jaws of Hakkon,_ it's possible for resident author Varric to meet an Avvar fan of his books. The Avvar claims he has read all the versions of Varric's _Hard in Hightown_ crime serial, including the banned version. Varric, who is already incredulous to encounter a reader in an otherwise mostly illiterate mountain settlement, takes this in stride.
    
    "Nice to know the 'rock falls, everyone dies' version found its audience."
    
-   _Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War_:
    -   Though it's not clear how many die and how many survive, this is how Sigurd's army is destroyed in Chapter Five, but with meteors instead of rocks. Sigurd himself is personally executed by Arvis.
    -   A high-profile Fan Remake of _Genealogy_ ended the first chapter this way as an April Fools' Day prank when the developers realized that they wouldn't be able to finish the whole game using _Blazing Blade's_ engine. They did this by throwing about a dozen copies of Legion/Roro onto the map when the chapter would normally end, who would then proceed to wipe the floor with the player's army, shouting "FE4A is dead!" as they attacked.
-   _Dead by Daylight_ has the Endgame Collapse. When a gate opens, or the killer shuts the hatch, the Entity notices and a timer starts counting down. The timer is two minutes by default, but slows down if a survivor is in a Dying state or hooked. Once time runs out, if any survivors are still on the map, the Entity _personally_ kills them. This isn't particularly subtle - massive spiky tendrils erupt from the ground and impale any survivor still present.
-   _Hades_: After Persephone moves back into the underworld, your run through the game continues as usual; but since there's no reason for Zagreus to stay in the surface and he has to die somehow so that he can return to the Underworld, the narrator makes up an explanation for how Zagreus died after reaching the surface in a variety of ways. Or doesn't. (This was also what happened after beating the game during Early Access, before the ending was added).
-   In _X Com Enemy Unknown_, in the _Long War_ mod, if you take too much before launching the final mission the game spawns a horde of alien battleships that immediately start tearing down your satellite network and can't be defeated by your air forces. The reason? During the early versions of the mod, the streamer Beaglerush managed to exploit the travel time of the shuttle to the alien base and back (you can cancel the mission before starting it) to make your headquarters finish anything that was queued (production, research). Normally, when you unlock the final mission, time advance is disabled and thus you shouldn't be able to complete whatever you forgot to finish.
-   In _Inscryption_, Leshy has a very particular story in mind for your playthrough, which includes you dying at certain points so he can reset the map and introduce a new mechanic. If you manage to progress further than expected by beating the first phase of the Angler on your first run or the first phase of the Trapper in your first two runs, Leshy will declare "TOO FAST, TOO SOON" and glitch the game. This replaces the Angler's/Trapper's second phase with a nearly-unbeatable wall of Grizzly Bears, forcing the player to die.
-   When you're at Zee in _Fallen London_ and your Troubled Waters menace reaches 8, but you don't have a more plausible cause for your unfortunate demise, this is what the game picks for you. Glim falls, everyone dies. It even comes with a hefty stack of glim as a consolation prize. And in case you start thinking this might be a viable way to grind glim, the developers later added another failure state after the first seven Glim-falls where your character gets sent to the State of Some Confusion (i.e. goes insane with paranoia trying to predict the next Glim-fall) instead.

    Webcomics 

-   A wonderful _Something\*Positive_ strip is the Trope Namer. She had it coming.
-   In the _VG Cats_ comic Skittles, a game-mastering Aeris declares everybody dies from the plague transmitted from a rat Leo wanted to turn into a weapon.
-   The Dungeon Master decides that everybody dies in this strip of _DM of the Rings_. He apparently changes his mind though, as they're all fine in the next page.
    -   In an early strip, he threatens to strike everyone with 2d6 lightning damage when the players refuse to stop quoting _Monty Python_. It doesn't work, because Legolas sees the violence inherent in the system. The DM finally gives in and refers to him as a "Bloody peasant!"
-   Used as a response to... let's call it "criticism", of 4th edition D&D in this strip of _Ctrl+Alt+Del_.
    
    **GM:** An illithid appears and forces the cleric to tear out his own spine. The illithid then feasts on the cleric's brain. The cleric is dead. Forever. Rest of the party is fine.
    
-   A _Darths & Droids_ alternate strip in which the GM finally has enough of Qui-Gon's continual attempts to "cast Summon Bigger Fish". Fish fall. Everyone dies.
    -   Ironically, though, the player characters aren't included in the "everyone dies"...only the characters needed to continue the plot.
-   This strip from _The Wotch_ features the individual variant.
-   This strip of _Casey and Andy_ also features the individual variant.
    -   See also this strip.
-   Invoked by name by Parson Gotti of _Erfworld_ in this page and the pages preceding it. He wins a game that he has deduced to be basically unwinnable by uncroaking an extinct volcano causing... well, you know the rest.
-   _Absurd Notions_ shows a genuine party-killing deathtrap in this strip.
-   _Emergency Exit_ has one when the final boss of the RPG is killed in one hit.
-   Alluded to in this strip of _anti-HEROES_.
-   Tony from _Real Life Comics_ does this quite a bit when DMing. His favorite is "A dragon eats you."
-   _Penny Arcade_'s Tycho firmly believes that this is the final goal of _all_ GMs. Observe his prowess at it here.
-   This strip of _Does Not Play Well With Others_ demonstrates a rather disgusting, but highly amusing, total party kill.
-   After having the last campaign torn apart in one session and ragged with frustration at the nitpicking of the current one, the DM of _Friendship is Dragons_ turns to this. Fitting that Applejack's last statement before she sets the DM off is the classic Tempting Fate line of "Trust me, I know what I'm doing."
-   _Nerf NOW!!_ D&D arc had this in a Rebus Bubble.
-   Matt in _Dork Tower_ often does this (mostly to Igor). Usually it's understandable, but sometimes he can be petty. On one occasion he sent a bolt of lightning at Carson's character in revenge for healthy gaming snacks, after all the other players had announced _their_ intent to kill Carson's character for the same reason.
-   Doc of The Whiteboard says this after test firing a gatling paintball gun with curved backspin barrels. "BZZZRRRRRAAAAAAAATT!
    
    **Doc**: This is kind of a 'rocks fall everybody dies' type of weapon, isn't it?
    
-   In _Homestuck_ this is how reality ensures that You Can't Fight Fate. Deviation from the predestined path of the alpha timeline creates a doomed offshoot timeline and leads to the inevitable death of anything and everything inside, while also causing time shenanigans that push the alpha timeline back onto the correct path. Essentially, reality is the game master, and it doesn't like it when you fuck up the campaign.

-   In the "Dungeon Master" episode of _A Crap Guide to D&D_, JoCrap gets fed up when none of his players will listen to him as the DM, so JoCrap rejects all of their actions and then kills them all by having the Big Bad drop a mountain on top of them. This causes all of his players to leave the table.
-   The Spoony One, in his _Counter Monkey_ series of videos, tells of a _Shadowrun_ campaign that had gone so far Off the Rails, that he was forced to do a Total Party Kill to bring everyone back down. Spoony even suggests doing this once the party gets too rebellious, if only to remind them who's in charge. To give the reader the reason why it went so bad, the PCs brutally murdered a few museum guards and _janitors_ all because they were too stupid to wear masks after bungling through an easy heist at a public museum. Spoony was so disgusted by them he had to bring in "falling rocks" from a completely different game <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and kill them as they tried to escape in the sewers.
-   In _Avatar Adventures_, the first time the gang decided to restart the RP they ended the current one by having everyone killed by a god of reality in one strike.
-   _LoadingReadyRun_ 's _Desert Bus for Hope 4_: A New Hope. After raising $1,000 for the specific purpose, viewers were treated to Jer Petter's Temple of the Lava Bears. For an indicator of just how this went, Wil Wheaton personally called in and advised any remaining party members to cast "Don't be a Dick" on the GM.
-   In the French audio webseries _Reflets d'Acide_, one character has a nightmare of the GM punishing him with the French equivalent, the falling necropolis. The advantage of the necropolis over rocks is that if the character(s) somehow survive the falling damage from the necropolis, then they have to survive the zombies inside, then the lich lord...
-   _Darwin's Soldiers_ features a mild version of this the end of the second RP when Crimson Base levels Pelvanida with a massive airstrike. Word of God states this was done because the GM wanted the RP to end and it was starting to drag on.
-   Al Bruno III's _Binder of Shame_ includes an anecdote entitled "The Day I Killed The Entire Party Before The First Combat Encounter", involving an incident with a character's motorcycle.
-   Non-RPG example: Paul Twister uses this word-for-word to describe a nasty trap involving boulders levitated by magic, hovering over some treasure that he needs to retrieve, but if he does, his Anti-Magic will disrupt the spells...
-   _Door Monster_ featured a sketch showing a group of adventurers in a fight in a forest, speaking the lines of their players, and getting in an argument with the Big Bad who's speaking as the DM. After mounting frustration, all the adventurers are crushed by falling rocks that appear out of nowhere. From below the rubble, one of the adventurers _still_ tries to rule-lawyer that since he has the Rock Catching Feat...
-   _Critical Role_ DM Matthew Mercer jokingly threatened this by name when the group spent too long making jokes about NPC Captain Santy of the Shore Shanty in Episode 107 - "Does he sell sea shells by the sea shore?" It would have been an impressive end considering they were in the middle of the ocean at the time.
    -   Played for Laughs in _Critical Role: Campaign Three_ where Matt says this trope by name after the group had mentioned sexual innuendos one too many times.
-   _The Ballad of Edgardo:_ Initially attempted by the mods on both Edgardo and A Guy Called Squid, swarming them with dangerous monsters at the behest of the rest of the playerbase who wanted them dead. Once they survived, the mods became apathetic about the whole matter and didn't try again... right until the end of the tale, when the most powerful player in the setting has taken an unstoppable infinite power punch to the face and refused to keep playing after that; every player except the three _rioted_ on the forums until the ultimate version of the trope was called and the forum was _shut down_.
-   _TFS at the Table_ had an interesting take on this. hbi2k=, one of the players, decided to leave Team Four Star at the end of 2018 when the campaign was on holiday break. DM Chris Zito had to do a lot of rewriting to keep the plot going without one of the most important characters, which lead to the very next session starting with a Time Skip of two months, during which time the party failed its mission and was seemingly killed when the city of Eburkal exploded. The players picked up from that point with Lanipator returning to his original character Wake Scalebound<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  while Grant and Brian rolled up new brand-new characters. Unlike most examples, the players agreed to this in order to keep the story going.
-   According to TierZoo, which discusses various zoology topics in terms of tier lists in a fictional MMORPG called "Outside", this is why the dinosaurs were wiped out at the end of the Cretaceous period (though the extinction event itself, as noted in the introduction, is **not** to be confused with this trope). Specifically, the Serial Escalation of the overall top-tier status of the various dinosaur builds, to the point where they out-competed most if not all the other players all over the world, reached its peak during the Late Cretaceous, and the developers realized that there was only one way to restore balance to the metagame: implementing a balance patch that would render the top-tier dinosaur builds unviable.

-   Non-game example: the _Celebrity Deathmatch_ bout between Hanson and The Spice Girls suddenly ended when Marilyn Manson severed the bank of lights above the ring, causing it to fall on the two opponents and killing them. His reason was simply because the music of both bands suck. The real Hanson and Spice Girls were reportedly quite upset about this.
