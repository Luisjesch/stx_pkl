Turtles are often fairly long-lived animals, especially compared to other creatures their size. The common tortoise a species native to the Mediterranean area and often kept as a pet, is fully capable of outliving its human owners. Giant tortoises, such as those native to the Galapagos and Seychelles islands, are the longest-living land vertebrates of all: Galapagos giant tortoises often live to a century in the wild, and one specimen lived for one hundred and seventy years in captivity, while Seychelles giant tortoises are thought to reach around two centuries of age — their tendency to outlive human observers has made their exact lifespan difficult to verify.

The result is that tortoises and turtles have obtained well-earned reputations as immensely long-lived animals, something that often carries over to their portrayals in popular culture. Turtle characters are often very old, much older than other characters they interact with. The association of old age with wisdom and life experience is carried over and naturally brought to extremes — since they're so old, these ancient reptiles can be expected to have seen and done a great many things over their long, long lives, and to have had time to accumulate extensive troves of wisdom and insights to share with younger and more inexperienced characters. The fact turtles are seen as (physically) slow is also a factor — presumably they spent a lot of their long lives thinking _very carefully_ about things. In worlds of Funny Animals, Talking Animals, Civilized Animals and the like, tortoises tend to be cast as various iterations of the Mentor Archetype. Depending on the individual experiences and disposition the aged chelonian in question, they may be a Cynical Mentor, an Eccentric Mentor, an Old Master or any other subtrope, but regardless of the type turtles and tortoises are some of the likeliest animals to be cast as wise, old mentor figures.

This can extend to turtle-themed characters, even if they are not actual turtles themselves.

See also Sturdy and Steady Turtles, Shy Shelled Animal and Turtle Island for other common portrayals of turtles and tortoises in fiction. See Lovable Lizard for another reptile commonly portrayed in a positive light.

    Advertising 

-   One televised ad for Tootsie Pops has an animated boy query some characters: "How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?" The boy asks this question of Mister Turtle, who concedes that he never made it without biting through the hard candy shell. Mister Turtle may not have the ready knowledge, but he's wise enough to admit his shortcoming with an honest answer.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Dragon Ball_: Master Roshi, the Turtle Hermit and Goku's first mentor. He's an old man with a prominent turtle motif — he leads the Turtle School and carries a turtle shell on his back.
-   _Mori no Ando_: The wise old turtle whom the animals go to for advice and who appears to be able to read kanji.

    Art 

-   In _Beast Fables_, werereptiles have long lifespans, especially tortoises (who can live for three centuries), so they have a tradition of passing knowledge up and down through the generations.

    Comic Books 

-   _Bamse_: It is implied that the turtle Skalman is much older than any other regular character in the franchise, and he also is very smart and wise.
-   _Nnewts_: In Book 1, while running from the Lizzarks, Herk meets a turtle-like creature. Herk is suspicious of the turtle because of the Animal Jingoism between amphibians and reptiles, but the turtle turns out to be friendly and wise, and gives Herk some advice.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Finding Nemo_: This trope is referenced at the beginning of the movie when Nemo mentions that a schoolmate told him that turtles can live for a hundred years. Later on, Crush the sea turtle is a bit of a twist on the trope. While at first he doesn't _act_ like a typical wise old mentor, being instead a laid-back Surfer Dude, he still gives Marlin useful advice for his quest... and when Marlin asks him his age, he answers that he's a hundred and fifty — and _still young_.
-   _Kung Fu Panda_: Master Oogway, the mentor to Po's own mentor Master Shifu, is incredibly wise and old, the inventor of Kung Fu and one of the greatest masters of that martial art in history, and still badass enough to drop the nigh-unstoppable Tai Lung with a lightning-fast nerve strike pattern.
-   In _The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists_, an _Archelon_ named Archie aids Littlefoot and his friends on their quest, dispensing valuable wisdom and coming to their rescue on multiple occasions.
-   In _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf - Mission Incredible: Adventures on the Dragon's Trail_, Slowy is not a turtle himself but has it as an Animal Motif. He wears a suit of green armor that has a turtle shell on the back, perfect for a slow but wise chief.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Brazilian movie _Super Xuxa contra Baixo Astral_ stars Vovó Cascadura, an elderly turtle who guards the Tree of Knowledge and imparts her wisdom on the titular heroine on her journey to save her dog Xuxo, who was kidnapped by the main villain.

    Literature 

-   _The Grace of Kings_: Lutho, one of the members of the pantheon, has the sea turtle as his "pawi" (totem) and is the god of fishermen, divination, mathematics, and knowledge, and in practice basically the good Trickster God counterpart to another god in the pantheon, Tazu, who is the god of chaos and chance and is rather malevolent. Lutho, like the other gods, manipulates humans behind the scenes to achieve his desired (benevolent) ends, and in one instance plays the role of Old Master to one character, an intellectual master-strategist, and gifts him with a magical Great Big Book of Everything. The reader is clued into the fact that the wise old man is Lutho, partly because he's described as looking rather like a turtle.
-   _The Land of Green Ginger_: The Button-Nosed Tortoise is actually a magician under the effects of a Forced Transformation, but is still as wise as he was when he was a magician.
-   _Liaden Universe_: The Clutch Turtles are an alien race who resemble anthropomorphic turtles, who live a long time and are known for carefully considering every action before they take it. The one who gets the most page time, The Edger, is nearly nine hundred years old — and considered young and reckless by the standards of his people.
-   _The Neverending Story_: There is a mountain-sized turtle named Morla the Ancient One, the oldest living creature in Fantastica besides the eternal Childlike Empress and Old Man of Wandering Mountain, who offers some useful advice at a key point. She is so old and cynical that she believes there is nothing of interest or importance left in the world, and no longer cares whether she continues existing.
-   _Spellsinger_: In the magical world where animals talk, wear clothing and live alongside humans, the wizard Clothahump is a turtle. He's the closest the setting has to Wizard Classic, except, as a turtle, he isn't into robes and pointy hats.

-   _Elden Ring_: Miriel, Pastor of Vows who watches over the Church of Vows, turns out to be a giant tortoise (wearing a mitre on his head). He explains some of the history of Rennala and Radagon, and can teach the player magic spells. He doesn't even balk at studying "heretical" magic, saying that heresy is merely an invention of man. Turtles in general are viewed as wise animals in the Lands Between. Many Mage Towers are locked by a puzzle telling you to "seek three wise beasts", which amounts to tracking down three spectral turtles nearby and slaying them.
-   _Final Fantasy V_: The ancient Sage Ghido, a talking turtle around the size of a human, is the oldest living creature in the world, supremely wise, monumentally sarcastic (especially towards Bartz) and can engage Exdeath in hand-to-hand combat that leaves the young adventurers positively flabbergasted. He still needs help flipping over if knocked on his back, though.
-   _Touhou Project_: Genjii is a giant wise old turtle that serves as main character Reimu's advisor and means of flying in the early games.

-   The Game Mod _Ridgeside Village_ has Torts, a turtle that has lived for many generations in the eponymous village and is loved by many of its inhabitants, especially the children.
