_"She wants a little bit of earth  
She'll plant some seeds  
The seeds will grow  
The flowers bloom  
Their beauty just the thing she needs..."_

Maybe it's just a tree they've been tending to for years, a farm full of fruits and vegetables, or a flower they've just planted. Whatever the case, the Gardener is someone who grows and takes care of plants, and this often shows how much they care about living things in general.

The Gardener may be a farmer, gardener, someone doing it for a hobby, or someone simply caring enough about a certain plant in particular to want to keep it alive. May use magical/enchanted or highly advanced items for better results, although regular shovels or watering cans are more likely to be in use. Often what becomes of those who experience Call to Agriculture. A Caring Gardener cares about everything from humans to the grass beneath their feet.

Compare Green Thumb, which is about plant controlling powers, and Fertile Feet, where a person's powers cause plants to instantly grow whenever their feet touch the ground. But if they fall into a Heroic BSoD, they might end up with a Neglected Garden. For the opposite of the Caring Gardener, see Weeding Out Imperfections, where a villain compares "useful" people to flowers and "useless" people to weeds.

Truth in Television, especially as a hobby for older children and retirees.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Haru of _Beastars_ is the only member of her school's gardening club and tends to a large rooftop garden on one of the school's buildings. She also goes out of her way to keep all the plants and flowers in the campus healthy and looking their best. Being a rabbit who was always pitied for her size and defenselessness, taking care of plants was one of the things she did to cope because for once she was a protector instead of being the protected. While discussing gardening with Legoshi, she states that her and the plants "need each other."
-   Shiemi of _Blue Exorcist_. Ever since she was a young child, Shiemi loved gardening. While Shiemi is a sweet girl, she's also painfully shy and never ventures out of her grandmother's garden until Rin and Yukio intervene. She becomes an Exwire, but still loves plant life and her knowledge in gardening can be useful on occasion.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_: Harzak Lolas, the caretaker of Lindy Blueshake, also gardens as a hobby.
-   Senshi from _Delicious in Dungeon_ grows vegetables in the backs of earth golems. He's also highly respectful of the titular dungeon and always tries his best not to harm it in any way, even when harvesting resources (e.g. never hunting too many members of one species at a time).
-   _Fruits Basket_: Yuki Sohma, the polite and soft-spoken "Prince" of the school, has a private vegetable garden that he refers to as his "secret base". His willingness to reveal it to Tohru and letting her help him take care of it is a notable sign that he's opening up more to her.
-   Kenichi Shirahama of _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_ is a member of the gardening club. A whole chapter is dedicated to some thugs who seek revenge on him destroying the plants he and fellow member Yuuka Izumi are tending to, and they frantically try to save as many as possible afterwards.
-   Lucoa from _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_ is a former agricultural goddess who does volunteer farm work in her spare time (and she does it all by hand rather than using her magic). It draws a sharp contrast with her normal role as a Comedic Shotacon.
-   Fred of _Moriarty the Patriot_ cares for the gardens for the Moriartys and is very fond of the roses especially, and is also one of the only members besides William of the Moriarty crew to take an active interest in helping people individually.

-   _Samurai Executioner_: A condemned prisoner asks Asaemon to decapitate his prize chrysanthemum before taking his head, and then spend a year growing a new one before decapitating it too. Asaemon complies, but finds that he cannot decapitate the one he grew himself. The old gardener had killed someone in a rage for carelessly damaging his flowers, and wanted Asaemon to understand his mindset.
-   Flowertchi from _Tamagotchi_ is an Innocent Flower Girl who is often seen taking care of the flowers at Tamagotchi School, as well as the garden at her own house.
-   _Tiger & Bunny_: In season 2, Barnaby Brooks jr. had filled his minimalistic Ascetic Aesthetic apartment with various plants that he loves and cares for when returning from his hero duties. It reflects his warmer and kinder deposition after the events of the first season.

    Comic Books 

-   The _DC Comics_ character Poison Ivy from _Batman_, is a subversion, as a villainous gardener, hurting people, instead of helping them, usually caring only for plants and not for people. Over the years, she has gained several plant-based powers, although her backstory is usually kept as her starting as a mundane gardener/botanist.
-   Storm of the X-Men maintained a wide variety of plants in her attic room of Xavier's mansion and was genuinely remorseful and guilt-ridden to find them all dead after her long sojourn in space.
-   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: Played With. The Amazon sculptor Iphthime values plants and gardens as a hobby and seems like a very mellow mediator rather than as stubborn and competitive as most Amazons. However she aided in the plot which kicked of the Themysciran Civil war even if she turned on the saboteurs once she realizes just how far they intended to go, she still aided in their plot to frame the Bana for defacing and mining the memorial at Dooms Doorway.

    Fan Works 

-   _Rocketship Voyager_. Agritech Keshari runs the Air Garden that recycles the air and provides vegetables for the eponymous rocketship. She is the Caring Gardener version as she acts as The Confidant for the crew, and even offers to make a Heroic Sacrifice to get them back home.
-   The Warhammer 40,000 fic _A Wolf In The Garden_ portrays _Nurgle_ of all people as this. Though it's Justified with _this_ version embodying all of Nurgle's _positive_ aspects, which his Chaos counterpart actively purged from himself and sealed behind The Veil along with the other Chaos Gods.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh_: In _The Blustery Day_ and _Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, Too_, it's established that Rabbit loves tending to his vegetable garden, and that it's not wise to mess with it in any way, shape or form. Further expanded on in future ventures.
-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Forgotten Friendship_ introduces Wallflower Blush, a Canterlot High School student who's tending to a small garden on school grounds. She's rather proud of being in the gardening club, even though she's the sole member... and pretty much the only person to _know_ about the garden. She proves to be a subversion of the trope, as she's actually the angry, embittered main villain of the special who sees the plants as the closest thing she has to friends and nearly wrecks Sunset Shimmer's life over her rage at feeling isolated. She gets better toward the end of the special, and she's later joined in the club by Derpy Hooves and Roseluck.
-   _Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars_: The first two NASA employees Tom and Jerry meet are a pair of men who have artistically decorated the lawn and nearby hedges, and are deeply upset when Tom and Jerry's antics start destroying their work.

-   In _Ophelia_, the title character has a fascination with plants. She's kept potted plants on her bedroom windowsill since she was a child (her collection has grown substantially over the years), weaves flowers into her hair and demonstrates knowledge on plants and their properties and/or symbology, such as correctly identifying a flower as poisonous belladonna and her distribution of flowers and herbs based on what they symbolise. Her interest in gardening and nature helps underline her as nurturing and kind-hearted.
-   In _Saving Grace_ the widowed protagonist is a dedicated gardener. She won't even let a withering pot plant die because she wants to help the plant. This kicks off the story for the financially distressed woman.
-   _Solarbabies:_ The Warden uses some of his limited drinking water rations to make a flower grow in the middle of the desert. Strictor kills the flower just to be a jerk.

    Literature 

-   Brother Francis, the gardener at the American Embassy in _Good Omens_, who teaches young Warlock about caring for all living things, even Brother Slug and Sister Potato Weevil. May in fact be St Francis of Assisi (except in the TV series, where he's Aziraphale in disguise.)

Even after finding out that it wouldn't help her with magic at all, she continues to do it as a hobby well into her teenage years, much to the confusion of everyone around her.
    -   Mary tended the flowers in her family's garden when she was younger, and it was Alan commenting on her green thumb that caused her to fall in love with him in the original game.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Warhammer 40,000_: Horrifically subverted with the Garden of Nurgle, an Eldritch Location devoted to the concept of disease, corruption and decay filled with monstrous flowers.

-   _Harvest Moon_:
    -   Nina from _Harvest Moon_ is the sweet and perpetually happy daughter of the local florist.

-   _Tattered World_: Robin is the resident gardener, having gotten into the hobby as a child when her grandmother snapped her out of a Dumb Struck state by having her sing to a cabbage to help it grow better (when in reality, she stepped in to care for it behind Robin's back).

    -   Played straight with Perfuma, the hippie-ish princess of Plumeria, who's one of the kinder and friendlier princesses. While she has Green Thumb powers, she also seems to garden in general - in "The Valley of the Lost" she even complains about how hard it is to get it right when watering cacti.
    -   Inverted with Shadow Weaver, who takes up gardening in season four without becoming any less of a Manipulative Bastard; as pointed out in this post (link contains season 4 spoilers), her garden, which she's constantly pruning, is a microcosm of how she treats people - she raises them to serve her own purposes, shapes their growth, and tries to cut away the parts that don't serve her ends.
-   _Steven Universe_: Rose Quartz was the most caring member of her team, being the start of Gems caring about humans, and also has some plant-based powers, that she uses to garden.
