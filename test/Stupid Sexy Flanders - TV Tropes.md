_"You know, it's not gay if you think Rudy's hot. We all think he's hot. My God, you're beautiful."_

You are completely heterosexual, you are very much attracted to individuals of the opposite sex and you certainly aren't gay. But, you know, there are some examples of the same sex whom you can't help but admire. You can appreciate good looks and a sexy body regardless of gender. If taken far enough you just might say something that sounds wrong even in context. Indignation usually follows.

This often doesn't mean anything significant regarding your overall sexual orientation, though often you are just as caught off guard as the people around you. When applied to specific individuals who tend to provoke this response to people in general, see Even the Guys Want Him and Even the Girls Want Her.

If done enough times as a Running Gag, writers actually planning to out a character later can use this as foreshadowing. In some of these cases, this may be caused by a Closet Key. If it's taken seriously but isn't a set up for a reveal about the character's sexuality, it can sometimes lead to If It's You, It's Okay.

Nearly all Wholesome Crossdressers, and many Bifauxnen are subject to this gag at least once.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Occasionally, the "victim" is given peace of mind by discovering their totally platonic (really!) crush is really Sweet Polly Oliver.

This is Truth in Television, with women being _much_ more open about it. Quite frankly, if a guy were to say something like that to another, more often than not, the response would be, "What are you, gay?" Contrariwise, gay men are generally more likely than lesbians to joke about who they would switch teams for. When straight men do profess attraction to other men, it often takes the form of Gay Bravado—the concept being that they're not _really_ attracted to guys, they're just so straight they're not scared to _pretend_ they are (or alternatively, so comfortable with their mostly-straightness that they aren't afraid to admit to occasional "lapses").

Trope Namer comes from one of Homer Simpson's quotes from _The Simpsons_. While he's attempting to recall his skiing lessons, his mind shifts to a skin-tight ski-suit-wearing Ned Flanders moments prior, who waggles his buttocks while exclaiming the suit makes it feel like he's "wearing nothing at all". Cue Squick from Homer and the trope invoked.

The term "GAR" (always in capitals) is memetically used to describe a male character who induces this through **sheer badassery and Hot-Blooded\-ness**. This term originated on 4chan's /a/, originally describing the character Archer from _Fate/stay night_.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In episode 12 of _Student Council's Discretion_ Ken is afflicted with a case of Stupid Sexy Flanders when Nakameguro shows up.
-   The eponymous character of _Hayate the Combat Butler_ is known to have androgynous features and has induced many uncomfortable feelings among guys every time he is forced to crossdress.
-   Several instances in _Sailor Moon_ even after Haruka Tenoh is revealed to be a woman. Haruka herself certainly doesn't mind the attention, even going so far as to playfully flirt with some of the Inner Senshi (particularly Usagi).
-   _Agravity Boys_: The feminine looking Chris has male friends who fear they may find shirtless Chris attractive.
-   In the harem comedy _Ai Kora_, Handsome Lech protagonist Maeda is freaked out to learn that New Transfer Student Haiji Kikuno is a bisexual Love Freak who has the hots for him because of his "pure heart". Maeda is further freaked out when he learns Haiji has his ideal butt.
-   The _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ short "Viral's Sweet Dream" is pretty much all about Viral's issues with this.
    
    **Viral:** Why was I dreaming of _Kamina_!? Well, I guess I'm allowed to have sweet dr- NO, NO! NOT SWEET! _NOT SWEET!_
    
-   In _Ranma ½_, most of Ranma's classmates find themselves attracted to his female form, even though they _know_ that he's really a guy. The reason for this is most likely that he's susceptible to extreme Clothing Damage, especially in his female form, and that his curse actually gives him the real body of a girl. To quote one chapter of the manga, "We don't care! She's still hot!" ...much to the disgust of the female classmates.
-   Present in _Urusei Yatsura_, most notably with Ryuunosuke, who gets hit on from both ends... the girls, who know damn well she's a girl, love her because she cuts the figure of a bishonen man so well, and the guys love her... well... because they're horndogs, and know that she has an impressive-sized bust when her boobs aren't tied down.
-   Basically the entire premise of _Maria†Holic_, in which the lesbian protagonist transfers to a girl's school so she can be around a lot of pretty girls - and is very very annoyed when the prettiest girl turns out to be a cruel, rude, crossdressing boy... and she still gets nosebleeds when he flaunts his femininity
-   _Girls Bravo_: In season 2 episode 6, the main character Yukinari is forced to dress up as a girl, in order to host a gaming tournament. His disguise is so convincing that even the local pervert Fukuyama mistakes him for a pretty girl. This makes for one of the most humorous scenes in anime when Fukuyama finds out his true gender. Watch the moment of truth here.
-   _No Bra_ is a delightful little manga about two _male_ childhood friends who move away from each other and don't see one another again until they're all grown up... The protagonist stays largely the same as he was before, just taller, but his friend Yuki...<small>◊</small>
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Hatake Kakashi is widely suggested to be handsome underneath his mask. It's enough to make a ramen waitress, and her father, blush.
    -   In episode 53 the normally straight Jiraiya tells Naruto after seeing him in just his boxers (japanese version) "You're quite sexy when you're naked." and (english version) "You know, you have quite a tight sexy little body."
    -   There's Naruto's exchange with Haku, which just happens to occur while Haku is walking through the forest with a basket in hand, clad in a soft-pink outfit and allowing every lock of his long brown hair to flow down his back. At the end of the conversation, Haku Tells Natuto that (Contrary to what most anyone on earth would believe) He's a boy.After the reveal Naruto laments "But you're better looking than Sakura!"
-   Stupid Sexy Sonic from _One-Punch Man_. Dude Looks Like a Lady indeed, and only Flashy Flash can rival him in that department
-   _Bleach_ has quite a list of these characters. Ichigo, Byakuya and Ukitake just to name a few.
-   _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_: Upon meeting Natsu Tanimoto, Kenichi spends as much time worrying that he'll steal Miu as he does just being utterly _floored_ by his good looks.
-   In _Skip Beat!_, Kyouko inflicts this on one of her female co-stars while acting as Natsu, prompting this exchange between said co-star and her friend after the co-star gazes off into the distance with Love Bubbles.
    
    "What is this, this ticklish and itchy feeling?"  
    "Love?"  
    "AAAAAARGH!"
    
-   Hideyoshi Kinoshita from _Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts_ who looks like a girl, speaks like an old samurai and (tries to) act like a guy, all but insists he's male but has about as much success in convincing people as Bridget or Ranmaru. This leads to quite a few awkward moments, especially when he gets chosen to be the official "round girl" for the summoning war in episode two of the anime. One joke is that "Hideyoshi" has become its own gender designation within the story as both men and women object to him changing in the men's room, and Hideyoshi himself refuses to enter the women's room.
-   Konori Mii from _A Certain Scientific Railgun_ provoked this from everyone in episode 13 while in her swimsuit, including Kongo Mitsuko's _snake_. No small feat, considering the other girls were already strutting some nice guns in their swimsuits, and let's not get into Kuroko's Barely-There Swimwear...
-   _Bakemonogatari_: At one point, Psycho Lesbian Suruga admits she'd totally date Koyomi if he didn't already have Senjogahara. It may or may not make it an even stronger example since she was in love with Senjogahara herself.
-   In one episode of _Natsume's Book of Friends_, Natsume gets possessed by a female youkai who occasionally surfaced through his voice and mannerism. Kitamoto and Tanuma can't help but find the result uncomfortably attractive. There's also the time where, without any sort of supernatural aid, he managed to fluster a lesbian.
    
    **Hinoe:** ..._Dammit_, you look so much like Reiko! _Why do you have to be a **man**!?_
    
-   _One Piece_:
-   _Happiness_: The entire male population of the school is conflicted between the knowledge that Jun is a guy, and the fact that he makes a very convincing girl.
-   In _Trigun_, one of the Roderick Thieves, Nagi, gets a bit slap-happy when he sees one of the slaves they've just captured eyeing Legato for too long. The Vice-Chief is pretty sure he knows what about Legato is making Nagi so antsy.
    
    **Vice-Chief:** I get it. He's almost _horrifyingly_ handsome, but you're too cruel.
    
-   _Otomen_: Ooji Suzaku's sheer sex appeal makes even _Kasuga_ flustered. His nickname is "Prince Pheromone."
-   The eponymous character from _Kunisaki Izumo no Jijou_ looks so much like a girl that he tends to attract unwanted attention from men, much to his chagrin.
-   Ranmarou from _Ikoku Irokoi Romantan_. Gondou, who is straight and in love with Kaouru, is tempted by him.
-   Played for laughs in _Attack on Titan_. Team Dad Reiner heavily hints that he's gay, but that doesn't stop him from occasionally expressing the desire to marry Christa whenever she's being particularly cute.
-   Kiba in _High School D×D_ at one point gender bended himself temporarily and dressed as a nurse to take care of a sick Issei. Even though Issei knew he is a dude and his best friend in the club, he can't help but be attracted to him. Made worse by the fact that Kiba as a girl _is Issei's type of woman_.
-   _Baccano!_'s Victor Talbot considers being really, really ridiculously good looking to be yet another reason why Huey Laforet is a terrible person.
-   Griffith of _Berserk_ has been known to have this effect on people, most notably Sir Laban.
-   In _If Her Flag Breaks_ Megumu glomps Souta who appears confused and says "Hold on, why does he smell this nice?! And his body's soft!"
-   Anri and Shiro, both being effeminate Bishōnen attract this from guys a lot in _Adekan_. In one scene Shiro is walking in a public bath and since he's so androgynous guys assume he's female and ogle him before looking conflicted when realizing he's a guy.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_: The strip where Italy gets a request to "keep his eyes open longer than 10 minutes"
    
    **Italy:** Eh? But I'm handsome enough as I am now, or not?  
    **Germany:**: Think about how you'll be even more handsome and open them!?  
    **Italy:** Got it! _\[opens his eyes\]_ Like this??  
    _\[Italy sits there with big wide eyes; Germany looks disturbed, and ends up slapping his hand over Italy's face\]_?  
    **Cuba:** _\[laughing\]_ What is it? Was his face so preposterous??  
    **Germany:** Ah... how to call this... maybe 'too limpid' would be fitting.
    
-   Ferid, a flamboyant, openly Depraved Bisexual vampire, in _Seraph of the End_ invokes this trope as part of his odd sense of humour when he says about Yuu who is crying, "Awah! What's with that cute reaction?" while blushing and saying he thinks he knows now why Mika is so attached to Yuu.
-   Izumi of _Love Stage!!_ is harassed by three guys who want to find out his true gender due to his feminine looks. They lift up his shirt and are disappointed initially before they notice how sexy Izumi looks especially with him blushing and crying. They stutter flabbergasted that since Izumi is so pretty they'll make an exception for him.
-   _Fairy Tail_'s Sting and Rogue. A very erotic image of Sting and Rogue was uploaded by Hiro Mashima on his Twitter. Both boys are having a very intimate moment with one another while naked and taking a bath. Both are blushing and become seemingly aroused and hard while ogling at the other's phallus. Sting eying Rogue's with a lecherous gaze and expression of admiration while Rogue's jaw is wide open being deeply astonished and turned on unable to take his eyes off Sting's.
-   In _Shuukan Shounen Hachi_, when the guys are discussing which girls in the class they find cute, _everyone_ stops short of saying "Mikeya" before picking a girl. They all embarrassingly admit it afterwards. Cue a Sneeze Cut of Mikeya fishing on the harbor.
-   _Persona 4: The Animation_:
    -   "If I had to choose, I'd choose you (Souji/Yu) you're so handsome and reliable." Says Yosuke.
    -   During the Crossdressing Pageant, on seeing Teddie in an Alice outfit, one male spectator declares, "I'd hit it."
-   _Shishunki to Danshikou!? to Nakano-kun_ (_Puberty, an All Boys School!? and Nakano-kun_): Played with in that it _looks_ like this trope on the outside as protagonist Hajime Nakano finds his heart racing due to his classmates at his all-boys school, noticing that several of them smell nice, that one or more are particularly cute, and so on. However it's a subversion because what Nakano doesn't know is that literally _every_ student except for him is a Sweet Polly Oliver, so he's being attracted to girls without realizing it.
-   _That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime_: All those under Rimuru Tempest know that at the bare minimum he's a genderless slime, and more specifically has a male identity, but many of his male servants can't help but find him cute and attractive in spite of most of them viewing themselves as straight. It definitely helps that his Shapeshifter Default Form is based off the beautiful human hero Shizue Izawa after he assimilated her dying form as per her request, and that he keeps putting on feminine clothing at the behest of his _female_ subordinates.
-   Matsuri of _Ayakashi Triangle_ was turned female but still identifies as male. Soga knows this, but ends up falling in love with him anyway, constantly trying to fight his attraction by reminding himself that Matsuri is a guy.
-   In _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, Emily Sevensheep and Yue Ayase are trying on their new soldier uniforms, and the latter bemoans that it's too big for her, looking adorable in the process. Emily blushes and turns away, thinking about how cute Yue looked. It's heavily hinted later on that Emily is crushing on Yue _hard_ and that was just the start of it.
-   Asuka of _Asuka Hybrid_ has a complicated crush on his roommate, Yayoi. At first it seemed like straightforward attraction to a cute girl, but he's a little unsettled upon discovering she's biologically male, yet still passing a little too well as a girl for comfort. This is even more complicated for Asuka as he discovers this shortly after he himself is turned female, making him unsure if this attraction is because he's still a boy who thinks Yayoi is a girl, or if he's becoming a girl inside attracted to Yayoi for being a boy. To settle this, he ends up poking Yayoi's crotch in her sleep — he responds with immediate disappointment, which ironically reassures him that he's still straight.

    Comedy 

-   Louis C.K. has a routine about having this reaction to Ewan McGregor in his special "Shameless".
-   Jamie Foxx has an extended routine exploring this happening when he met Prince. While ice skating.
-   Ron White has a routine about pointing this tendency out to a homophobic cousin.
    
    **Ron:** Look, we're all gay. It's just different degrees.  
    **Ray:** No way, man! I'm not gay.  
    **Ron:** Okay, do you like watching porn?  
    **Ray:** You know I love porn.  
    **Ron:** Do you only watch the kind that's two women?  
    **Ray:** No way, man! I like watching a man and a woman makin' love.  
    **Ron:** Okay, do you like it best if the man is tiny and flaccid?  
    **Ray:** No way, man! I like big, hard, throbbing... Huh. I did not know that about myself.
    
-   Jimmy Dore realized he was gay for Jude Law when he saw _The Talented Mr. Ripley_.
    
    **Jimmy:** Remember that other guy in it, Jude Law? Well, ever since I saw that movie...I think...I could be queer for him. And have never had a homosexual feeling ever in my life (that I ever acknowledged). I mean, he was _beautiful_, he was prettier than the girls in that movie! And it caught me surprise; I'm watching the movie and I find myself going, "I wonder what he's gonna wear in the next scene. I hope it's linen. Ooooh, it's a pancake hat on a scooter! FRICKIN' **HOT**, THIS GUY!"
    
-   This and a lot more of male insecurities are the central theme in _¿Quien Pidio Pollo?_, a stand-up comedy set by the Colombian actor Antonio Sanint.
-   Bobcat Goldthwait admits this about actor Rob Lowe in his standup routine, and provided the page quote for the A Pretty Boy Index page.

    Comic Books 

-   _Blacksad_ has gotten interpretation (and reaction) from many male fans, which it may owe its gay fanbase to.
-   Willow engenders this reaction in Buffy's roommate Anaheed in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 9_ #1:
    
    **Anaheed:** That's what ragers are for! Your friends are sweet, and wild, and Willow has made me bi-curious but don't tell her that.
    
-   Daken was this to Venom and Bullseye in _Dark Avengers_. Add to that the fact that Daken is bisexual and also emits pheromones which can make him influence people of the opposite gender. Making his Stupid Sexy Flanders a _superpower_.
-   ''Deadpool has a fanboy moment with Thor and remarks that he finds him to be very attractive before becoming embarrassed that he said it out loud. Another time, he was overjoyed when, due to limited space in the car they needed to take, Captain America had to sit on his lap. Really, Deadpool does this often enough with enough different characters that he moves into Ambiguously Bi territory.
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   One issue has the title hero go headfirst through the windshield of a car where one male police officer is commenting about Spider-Man's form-fitting costume to his male partner. After a beat panel, the first officer points out Spider-Man's toned butt.
    -   Norman Osborn gets subtext with Peter/Spidey and during the _Return Of The Green Goblin_ arc of Ultimate Spider-Man, we get to look at things through Norman's eyes during a conversation with Spider-Man. The voices in his head tell him things like "kill him" "skin him" "burn him" and "kiss him".
-   _X-Men_: Mystique is mostly attracted to women (which makes her relationship with Rogue questionable to say the least); her longest, indeed her only real relationship, was with her lover Destiny; but she will have sex with men if she feels there is something to be gained (money, from B. Byron Biggs; security, from Sabretooth; power, from Senator Brickman) and she will completely lose her head over a totally unsuitable man who will usually end up abusing her in some shape or form, which will lead her to leave him, and then come back to enact a HORRIBLE revenge (e.g. Senator Brickman, whom she strangled during sex, after which she screamed at him, "How was that? Was it GOOD FOR YOU?").

    Fan Works 

-   Spider-Man, but only if you watch him dance, apparently.
-   There's some _Touhou Project_ fanart out there of Marisa thinking about stupid sexy Flandre.
-   Dio getting this reaction from male fans is something of a running gag whenever he's brought up. _Especially_ on SpaceBattles.com.
-   _A Crown of Stars_: During a talk with Asuka, Ching tells she is straight, but she needs an ice water bucket when she sees sexy, busty, Fiery Redhead Rayana.
-   _Advice and Trust_: Rei becomes extremely close with Shinji and Asuka to the point she confesses she loves both. Unfortunately Shinji and Asuka love her but not in that way, and they don't believe they can handle a threesome. Still, Asuka can not help to think about it sometimes. In chapter 8 she mutters: "Stupid sexy Rei..."
-   _Doing It Right This Time_: In chapter 2 Asuka has this reaction when she sees Rei trying a new dress. When she realizes she is staring she says herself "Stupid hormones". That scene led Asuka to realize she was not as straight as she thought and she liked both Shinji and Rei.
-   _Nobody Dies_ has this occur in chapter 14 with Ritsuko having thoughts about Maya in a plugsuit. What makes it notable is that not only is a direct homage to the trope-naming scene, it helps her come to terms with her sexuality and paves the way for an eventual Relationship Upgrade with Maya. Also, Ritsuko is moreso annoyed by it than grossed out.
    
    Misato took things into her own hands, packed up the adult novelties into the largest crate she could find and had them launch it via Eva catapult into the Pacific. Maya looked heartbroken but carried on, and Ritsuko stares at her computer and sighs.  
    _"It's like I'm wearing nothing at all."_  
    A grimace, image of her assistant's nicely toned posterior in blue spandex passing her vision.  
    _"Nothing At All."_  
    Shaking a bit as she walks.  
    _"NOTHING AT ALL."_  
    She sighs. Rubbing the bridge of her nose and slumping back into her chair, she rests her folded hands on her lap and shrugs.  
    "Stupid sexy Maya," she says, "Well, alright. I guess I'm a lesbian."  
    A bump against a wall and Ritsuko turns, just as Maya quickly gathers up her folders and runs back into the hallway. Akagi could swear she heard the girl squeal.
    
-   Mentioned briefly in _Princess (Laburnum Steelfang)_; Julien is a Transgender man, and can pass quite easily to anyone who doesn't know enough about lemurs to tell the difference. To other lemurs, however, it's a different matter, and surgery isn't really an option for him. Maurice mentions how awkward it is to work for a male-identified king who so strongly resembles an attractive female.
-   _Respawn of the Dead_ has a Shout-Out to the Trope Namer, except he actually _is_ wearing nothing at all at the time.
    
    "Stupid pretty Medic\[.\]"
    
-   In _Thinking In Little Green Boxes_ after Neville returns from Asgard, Draco has to remind himself to sneer not to stare.
-   _Hivefled_: Karkat and "female fetishist" Kanaya are both rather disturbed to realise they've been bordering on caliginous flirting when arguing.
-   In one side story to _Mare of Steel_, Rainbow Dash gets turned into a colt by Red Kryptonite. This still does not stop her from flirting with her Love Interest Thunderlane once she starts turning back into a mare, and Thunderlane has to try _very_ hard not to get turned on by her/him.
-   Due to having a link to Ranma's thoughts in _Zero Interface_, Louise starts finding Kirche attractive. While following them to the city, Ranma's thoughts leave her so distracted that she frequently has to dismount before she ends up doing something that'd make her fall off the horse anyway.
-   Rei is this for Asuka in _Neon Metathesis Evangelion_, causing her to mutter "Stupid cute Rei".
-   Regardless of sexuality, pretty much everyone in _Bait and Switch_ is attracted to Shinji in Yui's body. The only exceptions seem to be Gendo (who's furious that Yui didn't really come back) and Fuyutsuki (who still sees Shinji as Shinji).
-   _With This Ring_ has OL's relationship with Superboy. OL is mostly straight (though is well-aware that sexual identity is very fluid), yet finds himself surprised how drawn he feels towards Superboy, both on an emotional and physical level. It becomes a moot point anyway, since OL isnt comfortable with dating someone who's technically two months old (being a clone and all), and Superboy becomes romantically involved with Miss Martian like in the canonical show.
-   Duke Devlin from _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_. This is what Joey Wheeler says of Duke: "What does he have that I don't got?...besides the fangirls?...and the pretty hair?...and those gorgeous green eyes?" Duke then reminds Joey about his "sweet ass", and Joey admits, "Yeah, and a sweet ass too! But other than that, he's got nothing!"
    
    **Male Narrator:** Warning: This episode contains copious amounts of Duke Devlin. Women with heart conditions are advised to not look directly at Duke Devlin. This also applies to women without heart conditions; he's very pretty. See? See how pretty he is? He's very pretty. I'd like to run my fingers through his hair, and I'm just a voice.  
    **Yami:** _(about Duke)_ Mustn't... look... directly at his face... So beautiful! No words to describe it... They should have sent a poet!
    
-   Alucard in _Hellsing Ultimate Abridged_ has this reaction when he encounters the androgynous cat-boy Schrodinger.
    
    **Alucard:** Ah. The return of the "why?" boner.... _With a vengeance._
    
-   Izuku in _Nemurizuku_ is described as causing a crisis of sexuality in his entire class when he spends the day acting (and dressing) like Midnight.
-   When Nevareth Bladestrife rips his shirt off in _Luz Belos: Princess of the Boiling Isles_, Luz has to mentally remind herself that she has a girlfriend.
    
    _'I have a girlfriend! I have a girlfriend!'_ she thought, _'I really hope Amity doesn't find out about this.'_
    
-   _The Boy Who Cried Idiot_: Downplayed. Martin agrees that he's gay "for Lincoln" and describes Lincoln as beautiful a lot, however most of the time, he doesn't do romantic things with Lincoln but instead tries to be his friend.
-   _Switcheroo AU_: In "Bispearl", Bismuth finds Pearl's evil look attractive.
-   _Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse:_ Despite the ten years spent pretending to be a boy thing, Ukyo still thinks of herself as a straight woman. Unfortunately, her beloved boyfriend (and technically fiance) Ranma is a Sex Shifter cursed with Involuntary Shapeshifting into a _very_ attractive redheaded girl when splashed with cold water. It's something of a Running Gag that Ukyo will find herself reacting with attraction or even arousal to Ranma in female form, which the other members of the crew like to tease her about.
-   Taylor in _Ultra Beast of the Bay_ is extremely distracting to both Lisa and Victoria. The latter of which is especially confused how a six foot humanoid cockroach that's fighting off a food coma still manages to radiate an aura of "I'm sexy and you're all beneath me."

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Victor/Victoria_, a musical about a woman who poses as a female impersonator, features a gangster who knows full well she's a woman, but has to convince everyone _else_ that this trope isn't at play.
-   Played for laughs in _Orgazmo_:
    
    **Dave the Lighting Guy:** Dude, I don't wanna sound like a queer or nothin', but I think you got a hot ass!
    
    **Dave the Lighting Guy:** I don't wanna sound like a queer or nothin', but I think unicorns kick ass!
    
    **Dave the Lighting Guy:** I don't wanna sound like a queer or nothin', but I'd kinda like to make love to you!
    
-   From _True Romance_:
    
    "Elvis looked good. I mean, I ain't no fag, but Elvis was prettier than most women, you know? \[...\] You know, I always said if I had to fuck a guy \[...\] if my life depended on it, I'd fuck Elvis."
    
-   Norm MacDonald's character in _Dirty Work_ "understands why women find Sean Connery sexy," and steals a _From Russia with Love_ poster from the site of one of his schemes.
-   _Borat_:
    
    **Borat:** You telling me the man who try to put a rubber fist in my anus was a homosexual?
    
-   _Hamlet 2_'s musical-within-a-movie has a song about how Jesus is this:
    
    _Immaculate conception really makes my day  
    But the dude's got lats that make me feel gay!_
    
-   In _Hair_ a long haired hippie named Woof is asked by a shrink whether he was gay. He replies with "Well, I wouldn't kick Mick Jagger out of my bed, but uh, I'm not a homosexual, no."
-   Beca in _Pitch Perfect 2_ tries to insult the German team leader but all she can come out with is stuff like "You're physically flawless" and "Your sweat smells like cinnamon". She mentions to her that "Just because you're making me _very_ sexually confused does not mean I find you intimidating!"
-   _Death Note_: The live-action movie gives us the Spaceland bus driver describing Light as "quite a good-looking guy — not that I'm into guys..."
-   In _Dr. Jekyll & Ms. Hyde_, Helen's allure attracts every man in the office she works in, even attracting the attention of the homosexual Yves (much to his confusion).

    Literature 

-   Seregil of the _Nightrunner_ series is a Pretty Boy with a tendency to cause these moments among his male friends, either while he's disguised as a woman or dressed provocatively. For one friend in particular, the awkward moments are indeed foreshadowing for subsequent gayness.
-   Raziel is very prone to giving Biff some of these in _Lamb: The Gospel According To Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal_. Sure, Biff hasn't been laid in about 2,000 years, but sometimes you have to wonder. There's even a scene Biff _demands to see his angel-junk_ before the straight part of his brain realizes when he's doing and makes him stop. He insists it was purely curiosity. Raziel is also _literally_ stupid, and is described as being as dumb as a sack of hammers.
-   Terry Pratchett very explicitly lampshades the "man cross-dressing is _beautiful_" trope in _Jingo_ before utterly and wonderfully subverting it. The man in question is Nobby Nobbs, who carries a card signed by the Patrician certifying that he is almost certainly human. Because it's often necessary.
    -   He is extremely reluctant to change out of his female clothing, and afterwards Nobby is, for reasons never adequately explained (well, except for Rule of Funny), prone to volunteering to be used as the ostensibly female bait in any "sting" operation. Despite the fact that the beautiful and actually female (and hypercompetent, as she's also a werewolf) Angua is also in the Watch, and is frequently _partnered_ with Nobby for these operations. Very few people actually have Stupid Sexy Flanders reactions to Nobby, despite his expectations.
-   In _Maledicte_, heterosexual man Gilly finds himself baffled by his attraction to Mal. A case of Dramatic Irony, since he doesn't know (but we do) that Mal is actually a woman in disguise.
-   In the _Parrish Plessis_ novel _Crash Deluxe_, Parrish has this reaction to Glorious, the _Amorato_ who's been assigned the job of training her — even _before_ Glorious starts regularly dosing her with pheromones.
-   In _The Lighthouse Duet_, Valen encounters a very attractive young lad while out on the town, and spends the rest of the night finding his thoughts drifting back to him. That night, he dreams about the boy, and in the morning, is vexed to find that these dreams were _wet_ dreams.
-   Lux in _Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle_ is at one point made to crossdress to take part in a beauty contest. His costume lacks the usual wig, so it's obvious to the audience that he's male, but they see no problem with this.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _2 Broke Girls_: In "And the Model Apartment," the girls rent their apartment out, expecting some loser guests. Instead, they find Martha Hunt, Lily Aldridge and other Victoria's Secret models showing up.
    
    **Max:** Shoot, now I'm gay.
    
-   _30 Rock_:
    -   The episode "Believe in the Stars" has Tracy dressing up as a white woman to prove a point. When he runs into Frank and Toofer, he asks, "Do ya think I'm sexy?" in a high girly voice. Frank laughs, "C'mon Tracy, we know it's you," then swallows hard and says, "And yes."
    -   When Liz guesses (wrongly) that Elisa's dark secret is that she is a man, Elisa retorts "Do you want to see me naked?" Liz's response? "Sort of." Of course, Elisa is played by Salma Hayek.
    -   In another episode, Liz and Frank fall for the same delivery boy, leading Frank down a journey of self-discovery. And then there's this quote from the same episode.
-   In _A Bit of Fry and Laurie_, a character is showing off his fascist uniform:
    
    **Hugh Laurie:** You look absolutely great! If I was homosexual I'd want to buy you a drink, at the very least.  
    **Fascist:** Thanks. If I was homosexual I'd have a pint of lager.  
    _\[awkward pause\]_  
    **Hugh:** As it is, I like birds.  
    **Fascist:** Me too!
    
-   In the _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ episode "A Hen in the Wolf House", Fitz and Simmons watch Mack, Simmons commenting on Mack's immpressive physique, asking Fitz if he agrees. Fitz replies that he _must_ agree, since "Simmons" isn't real, just a hallucination created by his subconscious.
-   In _Blackadder_, we have Lord Blackadder and "Bob".
    -   _Blackadder Goes Forth_ had this happen for Lieutenant George when he dressed up in drag for a variety show, and ended up catching the eye of General Melchett who went as far as _proposing to him_. Blackadder ended up having to fake "her" death to get out of that.
-   On _Boy Meets World_, Topanga has a moment of this in one episode:
    
    **Topanga:** If it's any consolation, I think you can do a lot better than Jennifer Bassett.  
    **Shawn:** You think so?  
    **Cory:** Wait a minute, Topanga, have you looked at her?  
    **Topanga:** Okay, so she's pretty, she's tall, she drives a red new convertible, oh heck, I'd go out with her.
    
-   _Buffyverse_:
    -   Early plans for _Buffy_ included having one of the Scoobies come out as gay (logically, either Willow (who eventually did) or Xander (who didn't)). The former's chances became markedly increased with occurrences of this trope after her Evil Doppelganger episode, in which Real Willow comments, "I'm so evil and skanky. And I think I'm kinda gay."
    -   From the same verse: In one of the early episodes of _Angel_, this bit of dialogue occurs with Doyle, otherwise shown to be straight:
        
        **Doyle:** Just look at him, going out to fight evil, his long coat swinging behind him in a mysterious and attractive manner...  
        **Cordelia:** Do you need a moment?  
        **Doyle:** I'm not saying _I'm_ attracted, but...  
        _\[Angel comes into the office, says some heroic-sounding stuff, and marches off with his coat swinging in slo-mo.\]_  
        **Doyle:** Maybe I'm a little attracted.
        
    -   In "Superstar", everyone in Jonathan's world is hot for Jonathan. Buffy, looking for clues, asks Giles if he has a Jonathan Swimsuit Calendar. He replies "No! ...yes. It was a gift!"
    -   Xander has a few of these moments.
        
        **Xander:** No one is judging you. It's understandable! Spike is strong and mysterious, and sort of compact, but well-muscled...  
        **Buffy:** I am not having sex with Spike! But I'm starting to think that _you_ might be!
        
-   In the _Castle_ episode "Anatomy of a Murder", Castle is speculating about how a saucy love triangle might have led to a doctor's death when this happens:
    
    **Beckett:** How much TV do you actually watch?  
    **Castle:** Enough to know that this nurse McClintock will probably be super hot.  
    _\[the very hot but also very male nurse McClintock appears\]_  
    **Beckett:** Care to revise your theory?  
    **Castle:** Not what I was expecting, but no, I'll stand by it.
    
-   _Charmed_: Phoebe, during her brief time as The Empath, nearly had to flee the room during one episode because of a man who had the hots for her sister Piper.
-   On _The Colbert Report_, one of Stephen Colbert's threat-down's was "threats to his heterosexuality" and number one on the list was "attractive men" such as Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt. As he puts it, "I'm not gay, but I'm human."
-   _Community_: In "The Politics of Human Sexuality", Troy says that he lost the basketball match with Abed because "\[his\] eyes are too gentle and mysterious".
-   _Corner Gas_: Officer Davis avoids going on fishing trips with Hank, because hearing Hank's suprisingly poetic fish talk gives him "Strange feelings. _Tingly_ feelings."
-   _Cory in the House_: Cory finds himself lusting after a pair of chiseled legs in a pair of Daisy Dukes, only to find, to his eternal Squick, that they belong to one Jason Stickler.
-   _Friends_
    -   Chandler's reaction to a photograph of Tag: "Wa-ha-how! Don't show this picture to Monica! And please don't tell her about the 'Wa-ha-how!'"
    -   When they found out that Phoebe spoke French, Rachel said, "Oh! You're so sexy!"
    -   In another episode, Phoebe was stunned upon seeing Monica in lingerie, saying that she had "the breasts of a Greek goddess."
    -   There's also one episode where Denise Richards plays Ross's cousin, and all the guys (yes, even Ross) are turned on by her. Every time she shows up on screen, the intro of "I'm Gonna Love You Just A Little Bit More, Baby", a song by the late Barry White, plays in the background, while her hair floats in the wind. The episode ends with her showing up at Phoebe's house, who opens the door, has the exact same reaction as the guys (same sexy music, etc), and having an inner monologue that ends with _Go for it! She's not YOUR cousin!_
    -   In the episode where Brad Pitt plays Will, an old friend of Ross's, when Ross sees him and notices he's now fit he blurts out "Will! Hot stuff!" He then immediately questions himself for saying that first before anything else.
    -   Monica's reaction to Ross and Rachel's babysitter for their daughter.
        
        **Rachel:** Do you see what all the guys see in her?  
        **Monica:** I wouldn't kick her out of bed. _\[Rachel looks at her awkwardly\]_ No more vodka for me!
        
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Jon Snow has gotten this at least once, from the repulsive Craster of all people. This man, who infamously takes his own daughters as wives and makes more daughters to marry down the line, admits that he finds Jon "prettier than half of his daughters''.
    -   _Littlefinger_, who hates Ned, calls him "an even more impressive specimen" than his brother Brandon, who was already noted to be a Hunk in-universe.
-   _Generation Kill_: Remember, you're not gay if you think Rudy is hot.
-   _Glee_: As of 3.02, Mike finds Kurt's sashaying super distracting. Also, in "Hold On To Sixteen" Santana, a lesbian, says that even she felt something stirring in her "lady loins" when she saw Sam do that "magic sex dance".
-   _The Golden Girls_: Played for Laughs with Blanche Devereaux, who is so convinced of her own incredible sex appeal that she assumes that her female roommates must naturally feel this way about her. In one episode, she and Dorothy have lied on Rose's application for an award. Dorothy starts feeling guilty when Rose wins, and, when she leaves their cabin on the train they're riding, turns to Blanche: "Blanche, I'm glad we're alone. There's something I think we should do." Blanche's response? "Dorothy, I like you as a friend, but I think I'll pass."
    -   In another instance, Dorothy words some concerns over a lover in a misleading way. Blanche immediately thinks that Dorothy's somehow become attracted to her, and makes a metaphor-laden speech about how it can't be.
-   _The Good Place_: Tahani is Eleanor's frenemy turned genuine friend, not her love interest, but Eleanor occasionally has to admit that Tahani is very beautiful.
    -   In "Tahani Al-Jamil", Eleanor is going off on one her usual rants about Tahani to Chidi, only for it to end somewhere quite different from she started:
        
        "She wants everyone to think she's such a perfect princess just because she's tall and glamorous and has cappuccino skin and curves everywhere and now I'm complimenting her and kind of turned on."
        
    -   It happens to Eleanor again in "Michael's Gambit" when she describes Tahani as a "hot, rich fraud with legs that go on for days" and has to pause her monologue to say, "Side note: I might be legit into Tahani."
-   _Henry Danger_ and _Danger Force_: Many of the characters in _Henry Danger_ and its spin-off _Danger Force_ often play with this trope, often going so far as calling people of the same sex they admire "hot" sometimes, but often drifting into "Have I Mentioned I Am Heterosexual Today?" moments quickly afterwards, **especially** Ray, Henry, and Jasper. However, since the two shows are aimed towards kids and young teens, they don't go _too_ far with it beyond just using thinly-veiled and disguised innuendo, that the parents can appreciate, even if the kids and teens don't understand it.
    
    -   Example from Henry Danger:
    
    From the episode "The Trouble with Frittles":
    
    _(Ray is wearing a wedding dress after Schwoz pranked him)_
    
    **Jasper:** I don't know, Ray, I'm actually kinda liking the dress on you.
    
    _(Ray looks at Jasper angrily)_
    
    **Henry:** And there goes that good old inappropriate Jasper humor.
    
    **Jasper:** I didn't mean it like that, I just meant it has a nice figure on him.
    
    **Henry:** Dude you are literally making it even worse.
    
    -   Another example in the episode "My Phony Valentine":
    
    _(Henry brings his beautiful date to the Club Soda, a lounge/nightclub for kids and young teens and amazes everyone there with how gorgeous she looks)_
    
    **Charlotte:** Wow Henry your date is hot!
    
    **Henry:**(jokingly) Hey, back off she's mine.
    
    **Charlotte:** (giggles) I didn't mean it like that.
    
-   In _House_. This is very true of Chase.
    -   Wilson and House appraising coworker Chase:
        
        **House:** _\[on Chase\]_ Little girls who kiss frogs expect them to turn into you.  
        **Chase:** C'mon! I'm not that good-looking.  
        **House:** Yeah, you are.  
        **Wilson:** _\[agrees\]_ You kinda are.
        
    -   More comments about Chase:
        
        **House:** What makes a guy start drooling? _\[sarcastically\]_ Chase, were you wearing your _short_ shorts?
        
-   On _How I Met Your Mother_ Lily mentions that her friend Robin (who is a woman) is many things: "Friend, confidante, occasional guest star in some confusing dreams that remind me a woman's sexuality is a moving target." Lily's not-that-secret desire to make out with Robin was a recurring gag on the series, with her jokingly suggesting it only to declare it "Stupid...so stupid...". They make out near the show's end, though Lily realizes she liked the idea of it more than the actual kiss.
-   _iCarly_: Carly and Sam agree: Tasha's hot.
-   _Keen Eddie_: In one of the countless bromance gags, Monty encourages Eddie to to yet again stand up their intimidating boss Superintendent Johnson, and says, "It kind of scares me, _but I like it_." He adds that it's what he's looking for in a relationship, and that he thinks he's attracted to Eddie. Later, during the confrontation in Johnson's office, Monty tries to make a quick exit before the shit hits the fan, and means to tell Eddie "I'll leave you" on his way out. But, it comes out, "I love you.".
-   _Merlin2008_: There's also this gem about Arthur from "Sweet Dreams":
    
    **King Alined**: Every woman in the land is attracted to this boy! I'm almost attracted to him myself.
    
-   _My Hero (2000)_ has this happen whenever George kisses someone for one reason or another. He does it to Tyler in one episode and Stanley in another. He also admits that he quite liked kissing Tyler. Another episode introduces Xil, a female Ultronian claiming to be George's fiance, who also attracts the attention of other women.
    
    **Janet:** Look! George isn't going to marry her because, well, becuase...he doesn't _fancy_ her!  
    **Mrs. Raven:** Janet, I'm _straight_, and I think _I_ fancy her!  
    \* From _Mystery Science Theater 3000_, Mr. B Natural. Mr. B is played by a woman.
    
    **Joel:** _\[swooning\]_ Oh, Mr. B...
    
    -   The Trope Namer is referenced in the episode featuring _Avalanche_ as a character, a skier, is shown from behind, leading Crow to reference the scene.
-   _The New Adventures of Old Christine_: A guy briefly dates Christine. During that episode, all of the women who have even momentary contact with him take photos of him on their phones, which they trade and discuss whenever he's mentioned. In addition, he confuses the hell out of Matthew.
-   Michael Scott's epic mancrush on Ryan the Temp on the U.S. version of _The Office_. He gives Ryan the "Hottest Office Member" Dundie award, openly admits he'd sleep with Ryan (in "The Fire"), and calls Ryan "sweetcheeks" once in Season 3. And there are many more examples.
-   In _Parks and Recreation_, Leslie Knope has used the term "beautiful" to describe her best friend Anne on a fairly frequent basis.
-   _Quantum Leap_ featured a variation: the first time Sam leaped into a woman, Al was quite disturbed to find himself attracted to his friend's new body. One possible explanation given was "latent homosexual tendencies," which he immediately dismissed. Oddly enough, it never happens again despite Sam leaping into a few other women over the course of the show.
    -   Those later episodes also indicate that Al sees Sam as Sam, not the person he leapt into, while the opposite was true in the episode mentioned above. Fanon guesses that the "disturbing attraction" incident led the Project to fine-tune the connection between Al and Sam so it wouldn't happen again.
-   _Red Dwarf_: Probably the best example of this is Ace Rimmer (whatta guy!). Indeed, the ostensibly straight alternative universe Kryten went so far as to proposition Ace; when Ace points out that the man has a wife and family, he confirms this but says "A guy like you can turn a man's head."
-   _Seinfeld_: George gets all anxious and upset after he gets a massage from a male therapist...when someone mentions Evander Holyfield and how he's a good-looking man, George gets worse...then more so seeing a poster of Holyfield.
-   On _Shadowhunters_, Alec has been a tightly-controlled, terrifyingly competent demon-hunter who barely cracks a smile from the moment we first meet him... to the moment he meets Magnus, at which point he gets a giant goofy smile, blushes, stammers, and then immediately flees.
-   _Sherlock_, being a show rife with jokes about the Holmes/Watson bromance, has this sort of thing crop up from time to time. One of the most iconic instances involves John commenting on Sherlock's _cheekbones_ in "The Hounds of Baskerville". Sherlock has the decency to just look confused.
    
    **John:** You being all mysterious with your - cheekbones. And turning your coat collar up so you look cool.
    
-   _The Suite Life On Deck_: While checking out chicks:
    
    **Woody:** How about that one? Cute, blonde, nice legs. And, carrying a textbook, repressed bookworm, badly in need of good time.  
    **Zack:** That's Cody!
    
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   In the comedic Season 5 episode "Changing Channels," the Trickster starts throwing Sam and Dean into different TV shows (and each is a thinly-veiled Affectionate Parody of an existing TV show and/or genre) in an attempt to get them to "play their roles" in the Apocalypse. He first tosses them into Dean's Guilty Pleasure show, _Dr. Sexy, M. D._, which is a nice Take That! to _Grey's Anatomy_. When Dean sees Dr. Sexy walking down the hallway, he immediately gets all flustered and embarrassed and looks at him in an admiring and slightly flirty way. It turns out to be the Trickster in disguise and Dean figures it out because "what makes Dr. Sexy sexy is that he wears cowboy boots, _not_ tennis shoes!"
    -   In Season 6, Dean witnesses his angelic BFF Castiel making out with the demon Meg, and his impressed reaction has much shading of this. In Season 8, after battered-from-Purgatory Castiel emerges from the bathroom looking like himself, Dean's open-mouthed expression is also quite telling.
-   In later seasons of _That '70s Show_, Fez obviously had a man-crush on Kelso. To the point that, in one episode, he saw an erotic dream about Kelso, too disturbing even for him (and for Kelso too, after he learns) . As Fez later mentions, his admiration of Kelso's looks is "purely aesthetic".
-   _Titus_: In "Tommy's Not Gay", Titus has a moment in the neutral space where he talks about how everyone has had at least one moment where they are flipping through a Muscle Magazine "'cause you're a man" and upon seeing a well-toned man, he talks about his large biceps, ripped abs, and he briefly starts swaying his hips before he realized what he was doing. Throwing the magazine while screaming, he quickly did five push-ups and walked off, talking about going to a strip-club.
-   Eric from _True Blood_. Half the guys in Fangtasia are psyching themselves up to "offer themselves to him" and have erotic dreams about him. Also, in one episode Mr. Gus tells Pam "I'm no homo (homosexual), but he (Eric) is a _handsome_ devil."
-   Berta of _Two and a Half Men_ mentions that its a shame she's only into men because she finds Charlie's latest girlfriend attractive. She then thinks "Maybe if I put a mustache on her..."
    -   Walden's debut episode had him get a lustful reaction from every single female character, including Charlie's lesbian therapist, making it this trope for her.
        
        **Therapist:** _\[after hugging Walden\]_ ...Huh, maybe I'm _not_ gay...
        
-   _Will & Grace_: One episode has a woman causing this reaction in Camp Gay Jack. The woman was actually a transitioning trans woman who was "Karla from the waist up, and Karl from the waist down" until The Operation.
    -   In another, Grace is feeling insecure because her husband Leo is going on a Doctors Without Borders trip to Guatemala with a very gorgeous female colleague (played by Nicolette Sheridan.) When Leo tries to tell her she has nothing to worry about because she's not his type, Grace quickly snaps, "Oh, please, she's everybody's type, hell, _I'd_ do her."
-   In _Wizards of Waverly Place_, anyone who is an elf has this effect on people.
-   _Zoey 101_: There's quite a lot of same gender subtext between characters. Michael, for example, once called a boy attractive.
    
    **Logan:** Why do you waste your time with the drama club? Why don't you go up for the football team or something?  
    **Chase:** Because the drama club is loaded with hot girls, and I've seen the football team. They're not hot.  
    **Michael:** I don't know, man, Dave the quarterback's a pretty handsome dude.  
    _\[Chase and Logan look at Michael oddly\]_  
    **Michael:** I've said too much.
    

    Music 

-   Roy Zimmerman's song _Dick Cheney (Sexiest Man Alive)_ is about this trope.
-   The song "Andrew In Drag" by The Magnetic Fields features a protagonist who finds himself secretly attracted to his male friend after he puts a dress and a wig on at a party as a drunken joke, and then crestfallen that he'll never see "her" again after he takes the dress and wig off.
    
    _A pity she does not exist, a shame he's not a fag  
    The only girl I ever loved was Andrew in drag  
    I've always been a ladies man and I don't have to brag  
    But I've become a mama's boy for Andrew in drag_
    
-   A song by Draco and the Malfoys titled "Tom Felton's Kinda Hot" embodies this particular trope.
    
    _And even though I'm straight, I'm not ashamed to say: Tom Felton's kinda hot._
    
-   The band Gay For Johnny Depp (http://www.gayforjohnnydepp.com/)

-   Dani Shay sometimes has this effect on straight girls.Here
-   Flight of the Conchords has the song "Bret, You've Got it Going On" in which Jermaine attempts to cheer up Bret.
-   Voltaire seems to have a bit of this for Keanu Reeves in the song "Future Ex-Girlfriend".
    
    _And no one cares that you love Keanu,  
    Oh, what's the difference anyway?  
    Everybody knows he's gay,  
    Okay, I don't really know that,  
    But let's face it, he's too hot to be straight_
    
    -   Not to mention Johnny Depp... in a thong.
-   The song "No Homo" by The Lonely Island begins as a defense and demonstration of this but then amplifies into ridiculousness.
-   In _Shake It Up_, CeCe, commenting on Deuce's predatory girlfriend of the week: "No wonder Deuce like's her more than me. _I_ like her more than me."
-   Frank Zappa's "Punky's Whips" is ten solid minutes of this, chronicling Terry Bozzio' attraction to the androgynous guitarist of the glam group Angel.
-   Josh Homme from QotSA is famous among fans for this.
-   Franz Ferdinand's "Michael".
-   On the YouTube page of Shakira and Rihanna's "Can't Remember to Forget You" the majority of the comments is from women and girls, either stating that seeing this video is what made them realize they're lesbian, or that they're straight but that this video might be changing their minds about that.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Classical Mythology: Zeus, despite being prone to produce an offspring with any pretty woman he lays his eyes on, does this with young Ganymede. He finds him so beautiful that he kidnaps him to Olympus, names him his personal cupbearer (replacing or joining his own daughter Hebe) and grants him immortality so he can stay beautiful forever.

    Roleplay 

-   This happens in _Darwin's Soldiers_, to which Aimee mentions how she can see how Hailey thought that Subject 19 was cute.

    Video Games 

-   _Bungo to Alchemist_: Tōkoku Kitamura is an intensely pretty Dude Looks Like a Lady who wears Elegant Gothic Lolita fashion, so he ends up inciting this reaction often in his associate and the resident womanizer Katai Tayama.
-   Bridget's third ending in the story mode of _Guilty Gear XX_ involves him (a boy in a nun habit) fighting Johnny, a lady's man who flirts with everything remotely female in his path. Johnny flirts with Bridget before the fight... and then collapses in abject horror afterwards, on realizing what he just did.
-   _Fate/stay night_: Tohsaka gets turned on by Saber at a few points in the original VN Hentai game, though this aspect is removed for subsequent media.
-   In an odd femme jealousy subversion of this, Serra from _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_ starts trying to lay out terms of being around the camp to this beautiful blond girl who just joined their ranks. During the conversation Serra discovers this beautiful blond girl is a Monk named Lucius, and Lucius is quite certain he is in fact a monk, and male. However, given he looks like this<small>◊</small> it's hard to blame her for her conclusion.
    -   There are a lot of characters who face the viewer in their official art. They do not, however, follow Legault's<small>◊</small> method of planting a smirk on his face and looking like he _enjoys_ the attention. And posing rather seductively.
-   In _Mask of the Betrayer_, a male PC with a high enough Charisma stat can catch Gann in one of these.
-   Going by his later reference to the "strapping blood elf," Martek in _World of Warcraft_ is _not_ confused about the gender of that one "hot babe" in his tall tale. He just doesn't seem to care.

-   Oghren has a brief outbreak of Stupid Sexy Nathaniel in _Dragon Age: Origins – Awakening_:
    
    **Oghren:** The whole "quiet and stoic" thing must get you a lot of action, huh?  
    **Nathaniel:** I take it you're an admirer, Oghren?  
    **Oghren:** What? No! No! Well, not unless— _No!_
    
-   In _Tales of Symphonia_, an optional scene has both Raine and Colette commenting on Sheena's body, much to her embarrassment.
-   In _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door,_ one sidequest has a Goomba man ask you to introduce him to a cute Goomba girl. You're supposed to show him Goombella, but if you show him Koops instead, he'll start off admiring Koops's shell before catching himself. Poor Koops says it "doesn't make him feel attractive."
-   _Final Fantasy XIV Stormblood_: The Trope Namer is referenced at the hot springs in Kugane, with a Roegadyn man in his smallclothes as Flanders and a Hyur fellow in Homer's position. Incidentally, there is an "Emperor's New" set of armor/accessories which, when glamoured over anything, will make it _look_ like your character is wearing "nothing at all".
    
    (...Stupid sexy Roegadyn...)
    

    Visual Novels 

-   In _CLANNAD_, Tomoya initially goes through this with Hiiragi Kappei in his arc in the visual novel due to Kappei's androgynous appearance.

    Web Animation 

-   In _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_, Dominique, Inquisitor Karamazov's literal right-hand man, is sexually confused by Stripperiffic Fabulous Custodes.
    
    **Dominique:** Hey, Fyodor, we're surrounded again. But this time by a bunch of half-naked men. Its like a ruddy ocean of bare nipples and bulging muscles. _It's making me moist_.
    
-   _Homestar Runner_:
    
    -   The website does an annual review/mocking of photos of fan-made HSR costumes. In the 2005 edition, Strong Bad was baffled by a hot woman dressed in a Homestar costume. ("_Hot Homestar?!_ My brain is splitting in half!") He screams and runs away when the real Homestar walks in, offers him a back rub, and calls him "sweetie".
    -   Strong Bad invokes this on himself when he has an Imagine Spot regarding what he would do if he re-did the email "sisters". He imagines trying to Serenade Your Lover... but the only person it works on is Homestar.
    
    **Strong Bad:** No, no, no, no, no! That is not right at all! Making Homestar dressed as The Cheat fall in love with me is not what I had in mind!

-   _El Goonish Shive_:
    -   According to the rules, any straight Gender Bender becomes bisexual for the duration. Also, the "Female Variant Five" setting (and Ellen's "Venus" beam based on it), in addition to turning men into exceptionally beautiful women and making women more, er, "womanly", makes the victim extremely attractive to any non-relative, whether they like girls or not, for 48 hours (of a 30-day duration). Unsurprisingly, these two things lead to _lots_ of Stupid Sexy Flanders moments, most notably when the revelation that it only lasts the first 48 hours causes a lesbian to come out of denial. And then there's Tedd without his glasses, a borderline Wholesome Crossdresser (albeit an unintentional one). However, Justin, who is gay, doesn't actually think he's attractive to him (or other gay men).
    -   As explained in the comic, Tedd is _too_ girly for gay men (well, Justin at least) to find attractive. Straight men, on the other hand...
    -   It's hard to say if this is a subversion, inversion, reversion, or just plain weird. Female Elliot objects to his girlfriend ogling Male Susan, leading to the following exchange:
        
        **Sarah:** I'm sorry, Elliot, but _look at him!_  
        **Female Elliot:** ...Yeah, I guess he _is_ hot.  
        **Female Tedd:** Um, dude...?  
        **Female Elliot:** What? I'm wearing a skirt, and I have boobs. I'm not going to start worrying about my manly image _now_.
        
    -   Noah has been informed in the past that he has this ability:
        
        **Noah:** I have been told I could make straight men see rainbows.
        
-   As _Fur Will Fly_ points out, the opposite<small>◊</small> is definitely possible.
-   Aragorn assuming Legolas was a ridiculously sexy woman was something of a Running Gag in _DM of the Rings_:
    
    **Aragorn:** Your character is seriously hot. She's hawt with a capital "HAW".  
    **Legolas:** My character is a man!  
    **Aragorn:** Your character portrait says differently. _**ME-OW!**_
    
-   _Nanoha Rr_: Chrono became the butt of this gag when the _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_ Fan Webcomic _Nanoha R'r_ portrayed Yuuno as pretty enough for guys to have crushes on him. Observe<small>◊</small>.
-   Kano from _Kagerou_. Granted, Dude Looks Like a Lady... or is that Dudes Look Like A Lady?
-   In _Dominic Deegan_ Kiya has a Stupid Sexy Reinhold moment. That he is a man is not so much of a problem here, but the fact that he's a Calanian.
-   In _The Dragon Queen_, caretaker and guardian Rodney finds himself attracted to his cross-dressing ward and immediately orders Bradley to never wear such clothing again in his presence. He gets called on it later and repents.
-   This strip of Webcomic _Three Panel Soul_.
-   _Brawl in the Family_ takes this trope regarding snake and runs with it.
-   Hazel in _Girls with Slingshots_, when Jaime's sister Fiona comes to visit.
    
    **Hazel:** No... no, I don't _like_ boobs... I don't _like_ boobs!  
    **Attendant:** _Everybody_ likes boobs, honey.
    
-   Succubus Dabbler from _Grrl Power_ inspires this whenever she turns on the succubus charm to the max (she loathes having to lower it "below ten" in her own words) and straight women who see her in this form can be seen repeating "Not a lesbian!" in their minds over and over. Meanwhile, men have to remind themselves that they're married, or that she's a subordinate.

    Web Original 

-   Cracked.com's columnists (male and female) seem to have a giant crush on fellow columnist Soren Bowie, sometimes seemingly using any excuse to include photos of him in an article.
-   This trope is often the case with the "Ridiculously Photogenic Guy" meme.

    Web Videos 

-   _The Nostalgia Critic_:
    -   In his _Independence Day_ review, the Critic has this with Will Smith.
    -   And again with Keith David.
-   While she can't stand the movie, The Nostalgia Chick mentions a few times that Pocahontas is extremely hot.
    -   While Lindsay Ellis is bisexual, her character is presented as straight (except for the odd invoking of this trope).
-   _The Spoony Experiment_: Spoony wasn't worried about being gay, but a different sexual kink: He was just ranting against gamers who consider the underaged Rikku hot, when they slip in a picture of a \*ahem\* well-developed cosplayer in a kinky Rikku costume, distracting Spoony for a moment before cursing the "Stupid Sexy Cosplayers".
-   _Frothy Pint of Metal_: Happy Viking has this reaction to the members of _Týr_, who like to play shirtless.
-   _Honest Trailers_: _The Hunger Games_ has the narrator doing this to Liam Hemsworth ("I'm not gay, but would \*bleep\* Gale's \*bleep\*).
-   _Pretty Dudes_: Everyone knows that the other characters are attractive, and occasionally seem to lose their heterosexuality (which turns out to be foreshadowing). Most notably, Alexander is very noticeably aroused after challenging Zario to seduce him, and Sunji keeps casually mentioning that he would have sex with Ellington if Ellington ever wanted to.

    Western Animation 

-   A gay version of this appears in _Archer_. After Cyril and Lana break up, the latter seemingly sleeps with every man in ISIS as revenge. When Cyril finds that openly gay Ray is in line, Ray remarks:
    
    _"Girl, please... nobody is that gay."_
    
-   _Futurama_:
    -   In "War is the H-Word", Zapp Brannigan thinks he is dealing with this, when he finds himself attracted to "Lee Lemon" who he believes is male. He is relieved to find that it's actually Leela in disguise.
        
        **Zapp:** Leela! So it's you I've been attracted to! Oh God, I've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman!
        
    -   In the OVA "Bender's Big Score", Bender's response to seeing Constantine's (the guy Michelle dumped Fry for) ass:
        
        **Bender:** Ooh, nice! Now I see why she left Fry.
        
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   The fact that Ned Flanders is a chiseled male specimen is highlighted in more than one episode. The trope's name comes from a line uttered by Homer in the episode "Little Big Mom".
        
        **Ned:** Feels like I'm wearing nothing at all! Nothing at all! _Nothing at all!_
        
    -   Also happens in the episode "Lisa the Tree Hugger".
        
        **Homer:** This is all your fault, with your nonthreatening Bobby Sherman-style good looks! No girl can resist your charm!  
        **Jesse:** This was her choice, Mr. Simpson.  
        **Homer:** I'm sorry, I wasn't listening, I was lost in your eyes.
        
    -   There's another example in _The Simpsons Movie_ when Ralph Wiggum, after seeing Bart naked, proclaims "I like men now!"
    -   In "Hungry, Hungry Homer", while Homer is convincing Sherri to go to a dance with Bart (which he does by dressing up like a kid and infiltrating the class):
        
        **Homer:** Who would you rather go with?  
        **Sherri:** Tommy.  
        _\[cut to Tommy, who looks so angelic he is literally bathed in sunlight\]_  
        **Homer:** Well, duh! He's breathtaking. But Bart has inner beauty, like you'd find in a rodent. _\[cut to Bart gnawing on a cracker like a rat would\]_
        
    -   Averted with Hans Moleman. Nobody's gay for him... except in "Three Gays of the Condo".
        
        **Gay Man in Military Costume:** You're coming home with me!  
        **Moleman:** _\[in his old army uniform\]_ Yes, Colonel.
        
-   In _Clone High_, this happens when Joan of Arc disguises herself as 'John Dark' to get closer to Abe by joining the basketball team. This backfires when JFK starts to question his orientation...
    -   Lampshaded as thoroughly as possible:
        
        **Joan of Arc:** _\[in an obviously fake deep voice, wearing an obviously fake mustache but still otherwise a teenage girl\]_ My name is John Dark.  
        **George Washington Carver:** As in Jeanne d'Arc, the French name for Joan of Arc?  
        **Joan:** No, nothing like that. _\[shifty eyes\]_
        
-   In the _SpongeBob SquarePants_ episode "Squilliam Returns", when Squidward tries to picture his rival, Squilliam, in his underwear (in order to face Squilliam face to face), he also imagines him with a really buff body: "Oh no, he's hot!"
-   In _Total Drama_, Owen couldn't stop staring at Justin. Then again every girl on the show couldn't stop either.
-   In _Amphibia_: After discovering pictures of young local badass grandma, Anne and Polly give in to their curiosity and look for more hot pictures of her younger self.
-   _The Fairly Oddparents_: Upon seeing Mr. Turner in a speedo, Dinkleberg remarks "Hey, looking good Turner!"
    -   From the Ms. Dimmsdales pagent (the b-plot revolves around Timmy's Dad demanding the right to participate in the pagent to prove that men can be as pretty as women...for some reason).
        
        **Catman:** Say, think I can get her phone number?  
        **Timmy:** That's no she, that's my Dad!  
        **Catman:** So you have it then?
        
    -   Mr. Turner thinks teen pop sensation Chip Skylark is delicious and considers Mr. Crocker gorgeous (though hates him for it, thinking Crocker is eyeballing his wife).
-   _South Park_:
    -   The "Christian Rock Hard" episode. Although parodies, the lyrics of some of Cartman's songs are pretty clear examples...
        
        Whenever I see Jesus, up on that cross, I can't help but think that He looks kinda hot...  
        I wanna get down on my knees, and start pleasing Jesus: I wanna feel His salvation, all over my face...  
        And of course — Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled-up and toned...
        
    -   "Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub" takes this one all the way.
-   Octus has one of these moments regarding Lance in the _Sym-Bionic Titan_ episode "Phantom Ninja". When Ilana remarks that she doesn't get what the girls at school see in Lance, Octus replies:
    
    "Dark hair. Bedroom eyes. Moody demeanor. I totally get it."
    
-   In the _Dan Vs._ episode "Family Camping Trip", Dan has moments like this with Elise's ex, Colby.
-   Beezy to TCFM on _Jimmy Two-Shoes_. Then again, that may be because he looked just like him.
-   In _Family Guy_ Peter somehow ended up sleeping with Bill Clinton after he slept with Lois. This is because it's Clinton.
    
    **Peter:** Wow, you are _good_. You are REALLY good!
    
    -   One episode revolves around Peter going back in time to when he was 18 back in the 1980's to relive his youth. When meeting up with Lois, she's planned for them to go see _Zapped! (1982)_ on their date because she figures Scott Baio is androgynous enough that neither of them would be gay for watching it.
    -   Peter's donation of his sperm leads to him having multiple kids that look like him. One is an attractive Sassy Black Woman who hits on Chris. He's conflicted by this and says "SO MANY CONFUSING FEELINGS!!"
-   _The Boondocks_ episode "Pause" plays with this, especially this scene.
-   _King of the Hill_ Bobby Hill's favourite NASCAR driver is Jeff Gordon. Why? Because "he's handsome".
-   _Atomic Betty_: At the end of the episode "No Business Like Snow Business" Betty gets on the boys' hockey team, unbeknownst to Penelope and her friends who swoon over "him" from the stands. Then Betty takes her helmet off. Penelope storms off angrily while her friends just laugh it off.
-   A G-rated, non-sexual variant pops up in the _Bob's Burgers_ episode "Bob, Actually". Louise delivered a Valentine to Chloe Barbash on behalf of Regular-sized Rudy, but Chloe doesn't care and admits to only flirting with Rudy to get quiz answers. Louise is furious at Chloe for stringing Rudy along, but she can't seem to help commenting on how pretty and nice-smelling Chloe's hair is.
-   In the second webisode of _The Critic_, Jay goes through this when he's reviewing _Gladiator_:
    
    **Jay:** The story of men in togas, wrestling to the death, glistening in sweat... OH MY GOD! I'M GAY! Wait a minute, Jay. Pull yourself together! Heather Graham... Heather Graham... Heather Gra-HAM! Ok, I'm back.
