The one member of the heroic team who is most often shown cooking. May or may not be the only member who _can_ cook, but is usually the absolute _best_ cook in the team. May be, but not necessarily, a chef by profession. May be viewed as more important than The Hero or the Team Mom if separated from the team with either or both of those two, but this occurs only in more comical situations. Hilarity Ensues if this character is also a Lethal Chef.

May express friendship for their teammates in a non-romantic form of Through His Stomach.

Often overlaps with other character archetypes, with more humorous variations including the Big Guy and The Trickster. Compare Camp Cook and Supreme Chef.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Moe "Suzu" Suzuya in _Asteroid in Love_ frequently makes pastries to the Earth Sciences club, and, in one instance, spent some time teaching Mikage chocolate-making.
-   The title _Blue Exorcist_ Rin is this, of the Supreme Chef variety, mostly during the camping trip. Though the festival arc shows him being almost single-handedly responsible for his class's onigiri stand being so popular.
-   Mao from _Chūka Ichiban!_ is a variation. In a Cooking Duel show where almost _every_ main character and antagonist is a master chef, he is far and away the best of the lot. He's also the one who most often solves problems with his cooking as his lack of the complicated ancestral techniques most of his opponents bring to the arena forces him to pick up a talent for improvisation. He does have a superhuman sense of taste and eidetic recall of ingredients on his side, however.
-   Jet Black of _Cowboy Bebop_, since Spike and Faye are too lazy to cook.
-   Chang/006 from _Cyborg 009_. The anime version is a professional chef. And he _loves_ using his fire-breathing power in the kitchen. This was so important to the team that the 2001 anime dedicated _a whole episode_ to him and his cooking's impact on the group.
-   _Darker than Black_: Hei. Badass superpowered Anti-Hero ninja assassin Of Doom. And, according to the omake, really, really good cook.
-   Senshi from _Delicious in Dungeon_ is a Supreme Chef who specialises in cooking the monsters his team encounters during their Dungeon Crawling. The rest of Team Touden help usually help him with the cooking prep. He takes his job very seriously, insisting not only on feeding them but also on providing a healthy, balanced diet, and scorns the preserved rations used by other adventurers as a result.
-   _Fruits Basket_: Tohru's arrival saves Yuki, Kyo and Shigure from a lifetime of takeout (not to mention being swamped by dirty dishes).
-   _Hidamari Sketch_: Similarly, Hiro cooks for the residents of the Sunshine Apartments. It doesn't help her weight watching at all...

-   _Inuyasha_: Kagome often cooks for her friends, and brought snacks from her own time. The only one not properly appreciative is InuYasha, whose palate was ruined by over a century of having to live on whatever he could. Ramen and daikon radishes are all that he appreciates.
-   Arata of _Iono the Fanatics_, who joined Iono's harem after she mistook the Sobame (Concubine) audition for a Sobaya (Soba chef) audition.
-   In _Junjou Romantica_, Misaki is frequently seen cooking and is probably the only character who can cook, with Usami and Shinobu's incompetence reaching Lethal Chef proportions. (His sister-in-law comments that she feels shy about serving him dinner, since he's a better cook than she is...)
-   Kana from _Kanamemo_, replacing Yume—much to the delight of the rest of the team.
-   Reeves from _Kurogane Communication_.
-   _Laid-Back Camp_: Whenever the cast go to camp, Nadeshiko has been cooking for others.
-   _Love Hina_: Shinobu is the resident chef at the Hinata Apartments despite being one of the youngest.
-   Hayate for the Wolkenritter in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's_, which almost gave the rookies a heart attack when they saw their Commander reprise that role during their trip to Earth in the first Sound Stage of _StrikerS_.
-   Akito is a secondary chef and a back-up mecha pilot in _Martian Successor Nadesico_ but as he is the main character we see more of him than head chef Ms. How Mei, so he appears to be more the Team Chef than she does.
-   Sai Saici, the Neo Chinese fighter from _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_, is a Chef of Iron and very good at it. He also enjoys cooking large amounts of Chinese food for his friends when he has the chance.
-   Kimihito is this in _Monster Musume_. He's pretty good at it, too, which is a good thing since the only member of his Unwanted Harem with any interest in cooking is Miia, who's a serious Lethal Chef.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ has Konoka, Chizuru and Satsuki. Also, Nagi Springfield's old team the Ala Rubra had Eishun (Konoka's father, interestingly).
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: Shinji isn't explicitly stated as the only main character who can cook, but Fan Fiction likes to imply that. Of course, the only kitchen we see is "Chez Katsuragi", and she's definitely a Cordon Bleugh Chef with shades of Lethal Chef.
-   Sanji from _One Piece_ is a gourmet chef as well as a very strong fighter, which is important considering the nature of many of his pirate crewmates. He fights using only his legs so that he can protect his "chef's hands". And Heaven help you if you either dislike his table service or waste food. On another note, Sanji has experienced firsthand what it is like to starve on the sea, and will _never_ refuse to give food to _anyone_.
-   _Persona 4: The Animation_: Yu is the only person on the Investigation Team who is shown to regularly cook, and is apparently quite good at it.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   Brock. Even humans find his Pokémon fodder quite appetizing. Even without his flirtatious exploits, this is the reason Brock is on the team after Tracey got his Greyhound ticket. Ash, being the major battler, isn't as keen on cooking as Brock, Misty doesn't like dredging up thoughts of her irresponsible sisters (that, and the one notorious incident had her getting carried away), Dawn's skills as a Coordinator (failures aside) as well as her budget don't leave much room for culinary discipline (though to be fair she compresses it well), and the less said about May's cooking, the better. There's also a really good reason Brock fell into the job so well, which he manages to put into amazingly tactful terms:
    -   Cilan of _Pokémon the Series: Black & White_ picks up the slack after Brock's permanently Put on a Bus. It helps that he came from a Gym which doubled as a café.
    -   _Pokémon the Series: XY_ divides this role to two of Ash's Kalos friends.
        -   Clemont took this role after Brock and Cilan's permanently Put on a Bus. He's a good cook and treats his meals like any other invention (only this time, it won't explode in his face).
        -   Though not Serena is shown to be an excellent baker, making a lot of sweets like macron and cake that both Pokémon and humans (especially Ash) enjoy.
    -   Being from her family that runs a local restaurant, Mallow of _Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon_ is naturally an excellent cook for her Alolan classmates.
-   Diamond from _Pokémon Adventures_. He doesn't showcase his abilites very much and is more often seen eating, but he is very good at making high quality Poffins with difficult berry combinations. He also baked a pie to lift Platinum's spirits as he firmly believes that good food makes people happy. Earlier in the story he made tea and Old Gateau for her as well.
-   _Ranma ½_: Kasumi Tendō is the lifeline for her (mostly) halfwit extended family. Of the others, one is a Lethal Chef, one is too busy making money and the others just eat a lot.
-   _Rurouni Kenshin_:
    -   Kaoru's close friend Tae Sekihara. In fact, she has her own restaurant.
    -   Same goes to her twin sister Sae.
-   Makoto a.k.a. Jupiter in _Sailor Moon_, and she is actually good. She has to be, though, as her parents are dead and she lives alone. (How she supports herself is left unstated.)
-   Rey of _Saint Beast_ loves to cook and always takes control of the kitchen.
-   Hakkai in _Saiyuki_.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: Nia decides to take up cooking after joining the Dai-Gurren Dan, because she was tired of feeling useless and wanted to contribute in some way. Unfortunately, she's apparently a borderline Lethal Chef, but everyone avoids telling her that because they don't want to hurt her feelings. Everyone except Simon, who for some reason loves Nia's cooking and suffers no ill effects from it.
-   In _Tenchi Muyo!_, Ayeka's sister Sasami is in charge of the kitchen in the Masaki household. Her cooking is so good that she can get her Picky Eater sister to eat her most hated food if she's the one in charge.
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul:Re_, Haise Sasaki is one to his squad as a result of being the Team Mom. When he's too busy to cook for them, Shirazu and Saiko fret over what they'll eat since neither of them can cook. Ironically, Sasaki is a Supreme Chef, even though he's incapable of eating his own cooking.
-   Yun in _Yona of the Dawn_. Jaeha and Zeno do know how to, but Yun is _such_ a good cook that they'd rather not. Yun frequently gets marriage proposals from men who have tasted his cooking, and he seems to view it and his other Team Mom duties as just how he expresses his concern for the others.
-   From _Yotsunoha_, Nono is the official Team Chef, making food to feed her friends including Yuzuki.

    Asian Animation 

-   In _Happy Heroes_, Sweet S. does most of the cooking for the other Supermen. Unfortunately, her food tastes absolutely awful and the other Supermen will do anything in their power just to avoid eating it.

    Comic Books 

-   Among _Die Abrafaxe_, this role is fulfilled by Califax in the original team and by Caramella in the distaff version.

    Fan Works 

-   Greedy Smurf, the Supreme Chef in _The Smurfs_ cartoon show, is this in _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ since he isn't the only chef in the village.
-   In _Four Horsewomen-Family Is Forever,_ when Charlotte gets sent to rehab, she winds up in this role with her new friends there, including Sheamus, The Hardy Boyz and Big Eater Braun Strowman. She finds that cooking helps her to clear her mind and not want to do drugs.
-   In _Neon Metathesis Evangelion_, Shinji cooks lunch boxes for Asuka and Rei every school day, and dinner for them and Misato every day. And he _likes_ that role - that way he can contribute without needing to pilot.
-   Sonata Dusk in _The Rainsverse_.
-   In the _Shadowchasers Series_, most branches of the organization have a housekeeper who cooks for them, but in _Ascension_, Ophelia does it, claiming it was the one useful thing her mother taught her.
-   Cheney in _The Tainted Grimoire_.
-   Irina in _Unfinished Business (The Thing)_ is the official cook (among other basic duties), and she is actually shown cooking much more frequently than the Team Chef who appeared in the 1982 movie. Also doubles as a Supreme Chef when it's suggested that her cooking is better than Nauls.
-   Aldonza in _Zero Context: Taking Out the Trash_ serves as the caterer for Circe and Marc's wedding, taking advantage of the facility's well-stocked kitchen and her Super-Speed to work on _thirty_ recipes at once. The wedding guests are in agreement that she does good work.

    Films — Animation 

-   For someone who possibly doesn't even _need to eat_, Genie in _Aladdin_ summons a whole lot of food, including a roomful of baklava. He also manages to impress the Sultan with his cooking skills (not that it's hard to impress the sultan) and in the series once conjured a large sandwich on his head and said, "Hey Al! Lunch is on me!"
-   "Cookie" Farnsworth from _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_. Not exactly a Lethal Chef, but his "cuisine" isn't the most attractive.
-   Pictured above from _Kung Fu Panda_: At one point Po makes his father's restaurant's famous noodle soup for the Furious Five. This ends up playing no small part in warming their opinion toward him.
-   Long John Silver from Disney's _Treasure Planet_, the movie being an adaptation of _Treasure Island_.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Murdock from _The A-Team_ seems to approach cooking the same way he approaches flying: with great skill and supreme disregard for conventions or common sense. Steaks seasoned with cordite and served with a side of antifreeze are a staple in his repertoire, and were apparently appreciated by the team. Also, his coconut curry tapenade with toast points is the only way to make B.A. calm down after being duped into flying.
-   Kenny from _Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead_ falls into this role after the titular events leave him and his siblings without adult supervision. Unlike most examples, Kenny starts out unable to cook a frozen waffle, but is shown steadily improving his skills over the course of the film.
-   Clemenza from _The Godfather_ has shades of this, teaching Michael his pasta sauce recipe because "You never know, you might have to cook for twenty guys someday."
-   Samwise and Bombur from the film versions of _The Lord of the Rings_ and _The Hobbit_, respectively.
-   Staff Sergeant Storm from _The Thin Red Line_.

    Literature 

-   Polgara in _The Belgariad_ and _The Mallorean_, to the extent that the other characters avoid disagreeing with her too much because she hangs over their heads the threat of eating cabbage soup all the way home if they annoy her. Fortunately, she is usually right, so this doesn't matter all that much. The fact she's also a Supreme Chef helps a lot...though doesn't stop Silk from needling her about "gruel".
-   Doug's grandma in _Dandelion Wine_.
-   Rita in the _Dexter_ series. Dexter is not normally effusive, but heaps praise on her cooking.
-   The Eighth Doctor in the _Doctor Who_ Expanded Universe. One character notes that he has an "almost maternal urge" to feed people, and he occasionally acts like a bit of a Single-Issue Wonk on the topic of things like parsley sauce. Not only does he express affection by cooking for people, he also manages to be a Jerkass via cooking. However, one of his companions is at least capable of throwing together non-lethal meals.
-   Keisha in _Fish in a Tree_ is an excellent cook. Her specialty is making muffins with words baked inside of them.
-   In _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_, when Harry, Ron and Hermione are starting to get on each other's nerves after roaming Britain for a while, Ron complains about Hermione's cooking and she demands to know why she's the one who always ends up doing the cooking anyway.
-   Leo from _The Heroes of Olympus_ is fills out this role. He uses his fire-powers to start a cooking fire and his Utility Belt of Holding can break out ingredients.
-   Samwise Gamgee for the team in _The Lord of the Rings_. While all hobbits can (and happily will) cook, the narration notes Sam to be a Supreme Chef even for hobbit standards, skill further honed by the general lack of ingredients on the journey and the need to improvise. When he has to get rid of his cooking equipment for stealth purposes, he's, for a moment, heartbroken.

-   Sgt. Escrima in the _Phule's Company_ series. Also a Supreme Chef and a Chef of Iron, who took his Legion name from his preferred fighting style (which he teaches to other company members, including the captain) and is quite physically and emotionally capable of hospitalizing would-be food critics.
-   Kostas, in the _Prince Roger_ series by David Weber and John Ringo, who becomes the head cook for the caravan of human marines and their Mardukian allies. He also counts as a Supreme Chef, for his ability to produce the most amazing meals out of swamp water and day-old _atul._ In _We Few,_ the survivors use his recipes in the restaurant they open.
-   Bistèque of the French Kid Detective novels _Les Six Compagnons_ fills this role in the eponymous team.
-   Before he was made a bridge man in _The Stormlight Archive_, Rock was trained as a cook in his family. His cooking is very good, despite his complaints that "lowlanders" can't enjoy proper Horneater meals(Horneaters can eat and digest shells, bones, and other things humans cannot). His nightly stew was the first step in Bridge Four becoming True Companions.
-   Gong Su from _Temeraire_. He was originally a dragon chef<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  hired on to cook for Temeraire, but crept into the role of cooking for Temeraire's human crew as well by virtue of being the only one on the crew who's any good at it. He’s also a spy employed by Mianning, crown prince of China, keeping him informed on Temeraire (who as a Celestial dragon is also Chinese royalty) and his captain, Laurence (who is technically also Chinese royalty).
-   Long John Silver from any version of _Treasure Island_.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Buffy Summers on _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ reveals her talents as a cook by making a surprisingly good Thanksgiving dinner.
-   Bill Gannon tried to be this on _Dragnet_, but Friday quickly realized he was also a Cordon Bleugh Chef / Lethal Chef and steered clear of his creations as much as possible.
-   Mike Stoker on _Emergency!_ was a frequent cook for the squad. Roy even got his wife mad saying he liked Mike's spaghetti over hers.
    -   Like many real-life firehouses, the crew at Station 51 took turns with cooking and other chores, with storylines about someone's cooking skills (or lack thereof) occurring often. Also, Mike Stoker (his real name) was a real-life LA fireman who didn't appear in every episode, so putting him in the kitchen (out of sight) could have been the show's way of getting around any non-appearances.
-   Johnny "Drama" Chase on _Entourage_, who buys a condo _just_ for the kitchen, and who is more upset than E when E's french press coffeemaker gets broken.
-   Monica in _Friends_, as the gang seem to eat dinner at her apartment almost every night. She's also a professional chef and really good at it.
-   _Game of Thrones_: The Reach is the provider of food for most of the Seven Kingdoms.
-   Izzy Stevens in _Grey's Anatomy_ is this for her intern (and eventual resident) coworkers, especially at the home that she, Meredith, and George share. This is played with by the fact that Izzy bakes an absurd amount when she is in distress, normally resulting in more harm done than good.
-   Corporal LeBeau in _Hogan's Heroes_ is the resident chef, and either cooks as part of the current plans or just for dinner.
-   Lily on _How I Met Your Mother_.
-   Eliot Spencer from _Leverage_ is the Team Chef and a lethal combatant, but isn't a Lethal Chef - in fact, it's commented on more than once that he's an exceptionally skilled cook. Granted, this doesn't mean that he can't use his food (or the implements used to make it) to deadly effect - in one episode, he kills a man with an appetizer (...maybe).
-   Dwayne Pride from _NCIS: New Orleans_ isn't just the guy in charge of the NOLA branch; he's also the guy who cooks breakfast for his team before they go out to handle the case of the day.
-   Gerry Standing on _New Tricks_ has frequently shown his cooking prowess by cooking well-liked and classy meals for family and his UCOS friends. Given the reveal of his family being established and respected Smithfield Market butchers, his talent and intelligence for cooking and food makes sense.
-   On _Our Miss Brooks_, Mrs. Davis is the only main character typically seen cooking. Miss Brooks is less capable; in one episode, she goes so far as to describe her personal specialty as Campbell's Soup. There are some exceptions in episodes where Miss Brooks assists Mrs. Davis with her cooking, and in episodes where Mrs. Conklin appears. Most notably subverted in "The Cafeteria Strike" when Mr. Boynton uses his mother's meatball recipe to get Miss Brooks out of trouble.
-   Much from _Robin Hood_ - not that anyone ever appreciated it.
-   _Super Sentai_:
    -   Genta/ShinkenGold from _Samurai Sentai Shinkenger_ is the one we see doing most of the cooking aside from Mako/ShinkenPink the resident Lethal Chef. The rest of the Shikengers are the most frequent customers at his sushi cart. He actually is pretty boring cook, as many say his sushi is bland but edible enough, he dreams of getting two Michelin stars; and his curry rice is excellent but he wants to be a sushi seller alone.
    -   Don/GokaiGreen from _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_ goes a step beyond with this trope and actually keeps his teammates' dietary information on hand, so that he can suitably alter their portions based on their needs. When Gai/GokaiSilver is added to the crew, he joins Don in this role and even improves on the recipes he's written.
    -   Spada/KajikiYellow from _Uchu Sentai Kyuranger_ was a chef by trade before he became a Kyuranger and joined La Résistance against Jark Matter. He prepares incredible meals at the drop of a hat, throws Gratuitous Italian words around<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and his nickname in the team's roll call is "Food Mei-Star" (which he says while performing chopping motions with his hands).
-   Most Starships in _Star Trek_ have a replicator in the galley that produces cooked food, but _Star Trek: Voyager_, having to conserve energy, has Neelix as an actual chef. Unfortunately for the crew, he is also a Cordon Bleugh Chef (he's not bad per se, but as an alien his tastes are quite different from the mostly human crew).
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_'s very own Captain Sisko cooks (but only when he feels like it), having been tasked to many duties at his father's restaurant as a boy. It is implied that his cooking is rather good (but one would suspect you basically have to be a friend or family to get a taste).
-   _Star Trek: Enterprise_ has a chef, simply "Chef", because replicators were still quite crude at the time. This chef is never shown but often referred to. This is made fun of in the final episode where Commander Riker assumes the role of the chef in a simulation of the _Enterprise_, allowing the chef to be "shown" but as Riker playing his role.
-   James May on _Top Gear_, who seems to be the only one of the three with any interest in cooking.
-   Andy Botwin on _Weeds_, who even gets hired as a caterer on a porn set.
-   Neil on _The Young Ones_.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Band of Blades_: One of the special abilities available to Rookies is "Home Cooking", which allows them to reduce the stress levels of their squad after serving up a meal.
-   _Dead of Winter_: One of the playable survivors is Loretta Clay the cook, whose special ability lets her create food for the Colony. This can be lifesaving, as comestibles are in short supply after the Zombie Apocalypse and usually need to be found at random by scavenging.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ has cook's utensils as one of the tool proficiencies characters can take — one that presumably isn't taken very often, when thieves', cartographers' or smiths' tools provide more obvious game-mechanical benefits. The supplement _Xanathar's Guide to Everything_ has a section fleshing out some of the possibilities of these more flavour-based toolkits, and describes ways that a Team Chef can provide the party with more palatable and morale-inspiring meals than, say, a foraging Ranger, and can also provide insight as a food taster or positively influence an NPC Through His Stomach.
    -   Expanded on further with the Chef feat in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything. It grants proficiency with cook's utensils if you don't already have it, and on top of that lets you cook a meal during a short rest that will boost everyone's healing similar to (and stacking with) a bard's song of rest, as well as having an option to make snacks instead that can be eaten within 8 hours to provide a small boost of health at will.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy_:
    -   Halflings serve this role in the Empire, and even have a camp kitchen made from a modified steam tank. A mercenary unit of halfling chefs slingshot boiling soup on their enemies.
    -   Ogre Butchers prepare the food for their fellow ogres (read: what their fellow ogres killed) and serve as priests of the Great Maw.

    Video Games 

-   _Disgaea_: Hanako from the second game, Mr. Champloo from the third, and Killia in the fifth.
-   In _Evolve_ the task of cook falls on Bucket, primarily because being a disembodied robotic mind allows him to work on cooking at any given moment without detracting from whatever he's doing.
-   _Fate/Grand Order_: Several Servants are so good at cooking that they are actually in charge of Chaldea's kitchen. Those include EMIYA, Boudica, Tamamo Cat, Minamoto-no-Raikou and Beni-enma. Ryougi Shiki (Assassin), is also on their league, but isn't part of the kitchen team like the rest due to her aloof nature.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Quina Quen in _Final Fantasy IX_ is an apprentice chef who at one point helps Eiko prepare a feast for the team.
    -   Penelo in _Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings_. For some reason. Over the course of the game, her cooking improves to the point of actually being quite good.
    -   Ignis in _Final Fantasy XV_. Whenever the party camps out in the wilderness, he is the one who cooks status-boosting meals for everyone. He's such a brilliant chef that merely collecting a new ingredient can be enough for him to think up a recipe for a new dish. He even prepares great meals for them after he has been blinded.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   In _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_, Lowen is this and also the local Big Eater. It's justified since he's said to come from a family of cooks, with both his grandfather and father working as chefs for the Pheraean court.
    -   Oscar in _Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance_ and _Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn_ is the best cook of the Greil Mercenaries.
    -   In _Fire Emblem: Awakening_, we have Stahl and Gaius. Some of their supports have them use their cooking skills to bond with others — and if the other party is a girl, it may lead to a Relationship Upgrade.
    -   _Fire Emblem Fates_:
        -   When the player builds a Mess Hall in My Castle, _everyone_ in the army can potentially get a chance to be the team chef for the group. The results can go from excellent to hilariously bad.
        -   In-story, no matter which route is taken, Girl Next Door\-type Mozu becomes the cook for the Avatar's army group; many of her supports are about her role as such _and_ how skilled she is at it.
    -   _Fire Emblem Engage_: Subverted. One might _assume_ that Brunet fills this role, due to how he usually wears chef-like attire, and always talks about food and cooking. However, even after he’s recruited, anyone could potentially be the one to cook for Alear. With that said, Brunet is, unsurprisingly, the best chef in the game, as he's one of the only characters who can make an SS meal and rarely makes anything below a B (if he does, then it's intentional, due to wanting to experiment with new flavors). Brunet was actually supposed to be the Solmic royal chef, but he ended up losing the contest that determined that title.
-   Jam Kuradoberi from _Guilty Gear_, who fights to fulfill her dream to be the best chef in the world. At least two of her XX endings have her either cooking or feeding others. (Like Ky).
-   James Vega in the Citadel DLC for _Mass Effect 3_ can be seen the morning after the _Normandy_ crew party, cooking huevos rancheros for breakfast.
-   In _Mass Effect 2_, the role fell on Mess Sergeant Rupert Gardner, generally considered by the _Normandy_ crew to be the only man in the universe who can make an MRE taste _worse_. However, a quick pit-stop proves that when Gardner has the right ingredients, he's at the very least competent.
-   _Mass Effect: Andromeda:_ Nakmor Drack, a fifteen hundred year old and upward krogan, takes up the role of being the _Tempest's_ chef after joining the team. He's apparently really good at it. Just don't steal a taste while he's cooking.
    
    **Peebee:** Tastes good already.
    
    **Drack:** THIEVES GET SANDWICHES.
    
-   In _Persona 4_, the protagonist can become this if the player knows what they're doing when cooking a meal to share with friends.
-   In _Persona 5 Strikers_, Joker cooks the meals during the Phantom Thieves' road trip across the country, having updated his repertoire from just curry and coffee to replicating the local cuisines of the places the Thieves visit.
-   Arven in _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_ is this to the Player Character's friend group, and his storyline revolves around collecting ingredients for Medicinal Cuisine. He later reveals that, like Brock in the anime, as a result of his Parental Abandonment he basically _had_ to become a good cook. In the postgame he resolves to become a professional chef and cook healthy meals for mons.
-   Hai Yo from _Suikoden II_ may not be the only character who can cook, but his is the only cooking that is significant in gameplay.
-   Elzam von Branstein from _Super Robot Wars_ is this through virtue of being a Supreme Chef, though most on-screen instances occur when he's still cooking for the _enemy_ team. When it comes time for him to don a Paper-Thin Disguise to compliment his official Heel–Face Turn, he uses the moniker Ratsel Feinschmecker, which means "Mystery Gourmet" in German. It doesn't exactly help to hide his identity.
-   In _Tales of Symphonia_, three members of the total party excel at cooking: Genis, Regal, and Sheena. As he is introduced first Genis is treated as the Team Chef at the beginning of the game but Regal is the one who gets a small cooking themed side quest and a chef's outfit to go with it. The party also has one Lethal Chef, Genis' older sister Raine.
-   In _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_, Manana is the Ouroboros' de facto cheffypon, a status in which she takes great personal pride. When the party dines at the canteens of the various colonies, Manana will come up with her own variation of their meals that she can then cook for the party at other rest points. These meals confer bonuses in things like boosts to experience gain and enemy drop rates, at the cost of either sourced ingredients or silver Nopon Coins.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  She later takes part in a cookery contest in the City, as part of Miyabi's Ascension Quest, and blows the judges away with her patented Manana Doodlenoodles.

    Visual Novel 

-   _Fate/stay night_: The Protagonist Shirou cooks a lot for the various female characters who are visiting or freeloading at his house. He's so good at it that Saber, a Servant who doesn't need to eat, becomes obsessed with his cooking. It goes to a point that he has an entire spin-off dedicated of him cooking for other people throughout the _city_. His Team Chef qualities obviously carry over to Archer, his alternate future self, who plays this role in other spin-offs, most notably in _Fate/Grand Order_.
-   _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_: Hanamura's talent is his cooking. He's very skilled at it, so he's in charge of cooking for his classmates. He even uses his skills to murder someone (albeit, the wrong target) and hides the murder weapon within food, a place you would not think of. Since he's executed after the first chapter, his classmates note the significant drop of quality of their meals because of it.

    Webcomics 

-   Bitty from _Check, Please!_, with baked goods. The "team" part is literal, since the comic is about college hockey players.
-   Gozazi is the Team Chef for Paollo's guards in _City of Somnus_, baking waybread, cooking breakfasts, making sandwiches and caring so much about feeding everyone that hearing the word "hungry" brings him out of a panic attack. He's also quite a bit rounder than his teammates, but no less competent in action.
-   _Girl Genius_: Chef from Master Payne's Traveling Heterodyne Show. Most of his cooking is used in the humourous, ballistic context, but he proves to be adept at knocking together meals for consumption too.
-   _The Order of the Stick_: Though he does not often cook for his team, Belkar has skill ranks in Profession (gourmet chef), and shows a master chef's prowess when called upon to do so.
-   Bud from _Precocious_, especially with baked goods. To the point that if you see one of the _adults_ baking something delicious it's probably to his recipe.
-   In _Stand Still, Stay Silent_, Mikkel is the one who handles the cooking. Besides his cookies (adored by Lalli), his meals tend to be on the barely edible side. This may or may not have some small something to do with that crate of candles the team initially got delivered instead of their food supply. Worse, the very unbalanced replacements (tuna, tuna, tuna, some oatmeal, veggies and randomly assorted, mostly-used oddments) got the unplanned inclusion of an extra mouth to feed. All of which replaced _any_ hope of attractive menu-planning with a roulette wheel of a store cupboard and a ticking down timer.

-   In _Alvin and the Chipmunks_, Theodore and Eleanor are usually the ones seen cooking. Though we rarely get any indication that they're cooking food for anyone other than themselves.
-   Katara cooks for the rest of Team Avatar in _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, experience built from having become the woman of the house following her mother's murder. Her Waterbending skills help immensely in the preparation and serving of soup, as seen when she bends a whole potful into Appa's mouth.
-   Monterrey Jack from _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_. Mind you, whatever he cooks is bound to have cheese in it. The other Rangers don't let Dale cook, and Gadget's cooking apparently tastes like machine oil.
-   Bender from _Futurama_ — another Lethal Chef (literally, if you have a second helping).
-   Roadblock in _G.I. Joe_. He almost attended the Escoffier school in Paris before deciding to join the military, and requested the role of company cook after being appalled by the military food. Although he was relegated to heavy weapons guy for his ability to carry a squad mounted gun by himself, he still cooks for the Joes occasionally and it's very much appreciated.
-   Zane in the earlier seasons of _Ninjago_.
-   Carrot from _Ready Jet Go!_ is the one who cooks most often throughout the series. He cooks many strange Bortronian dishes, but is otherwise a Supreme Chef.
-   Greedy Smurf has this job among _The Smurfs_, and given the fact that he has to cook for a hundred, he does a pretty good job. In one episode, he got upset because no-one appreciated his work, and went on strike; the rest were quickly _lost_ without him.
-   Junko in _Storm Hawks_ is the one most often shown cooking, although Piper can cook too. Mostly because Junko is a Lethal Chef, which makes for more humour.
-   Mikey is this in the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)_ show. He's not a very good one though.
-   _Teen Titans (2003)_: While all the main characters are shown cooking something at some point, Cyborg is the one shown cooking for the Teen Titans gang most often. Robin usually cooks for himself, no-one else wants to eat Beast Boy's vegetarian food or Starfire's alien food, and the less said about Raven's cooking, the better.
-   _Ultimate Spider-Man (2012)_: Sam takes over this role when the team temporarily moves into Peter's house.
