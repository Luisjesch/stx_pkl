**Paul Kirby:** What was that?  
**Billy Brennan:** That's a Tyrannosaurus.  
**Alan Grant:** I don't think so. It sounds bigger.

For many decades, _Tyrannosaurus rex_ was seen as the undisputed king of the dinosaurs and the largest predator that ever walked the Earth. However, in recent years, an even larger predator entered public consciousness: _Spinosaurus aegyptiacus_.

Early reconstructions depicted _Spinosaurus_ pretty much as either a _T. rex_ with a sail on its back or a bipedal _Dimetrodon_. Then, it was discovered it had an elongated, crocodile-like skull and relatively large front limbs with massive claws — this was the way _Jurassic Park 3_ introduced it to the general public. However, even _more_ recent discoveries found it had surprisingly short hind legs and a paddle-like tail, which suggest it was a semi-aquatic fish hunter. _Spinosaurus_ was definitely one of the weirder dinosaurs, looking like a cross between a crocodile and a giant duck, with an additional dorsal sail jutting out of the water like a shark fin (which is threatening on its own). The second revision has yet to penetrate the pop consciousness, unfortunately.

Despite this, fictional spinosaurids will typically be depicted as fully terrestrial, human-eating predators, as opposed to the amphibious fish-eaters they likely were in real life. There is limited evidence that spinosaurids occasionally preyed on terrestrial animals, but likely nowhere near as often as fiction would suggest. Sometimes, they will be depicted swimming, but that's about it.

Despite not being contemporaries, spinosaurids (particularly _Spinosaurus_) are often seen as the Unpleasant Animal Counterpart to the _T. rex_ — when a work features a heroic _T. rex_, the antagonistic predator will often be a spinosaur. This is because, aside from the fact that the most famous member of their family is bigger than Tyrannosaurus rex, their crocodilian appearance adds to their scary, villainous image. The two will more often than not end up fighting each other.

Fictional spinosaurids will usually be either _Spinosaurus_, or its smaller, sail-free relative _Baryonyx_ — in educational media, _Suchomimus_ may occasionally pop up, but the others (namely _Ichthyovenator_, _Irritator_, _Oxalaia_ and _Vallibonavenatrix_) are pretty much unheard of.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Dinosaur King_: Spiny the _Spinosaurus_ is one of the dinosaurs used by the villains. _Baryonyx_ and _Suchomimus_ also appear in a couple of episodes.
-   _Doraemon_:
    -   A _Spinosaurus_ attacks Suneo during the episode "Running Away to the Cretaceous Period" of the 2005 anime series, but a T. rex saves him by fighting the Spino and pushing it off a cliff.
    -   At the end of the movie _Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur 2006_, the villains send their pet _Spinosaurus_ to kill the protagonists. Fortunately, their tamed T. rex goes to fight the Spino and manages to defeat it.
    -   Subverted in the 2021 remake of _Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur_ where some _Spinosaurus_ (with short hindlegs and a kink in the sail) appear but only as background animals, and don't even interact with the heroes.
-   _One Piece_: Page One, one of the villains of the Wano Arc, has the power to turn into a Spinosaurus. The introduction of his Spinosaurus form came before the discovery of the paddle tail, but he was retconned with the more accurate tail afterward. Being fully-terrestrial is a requirement in this case, as Devil Fruit users are innately incapable of swimming.
-   _Reborn! (2004)_: The villainous Kikyou has Spinosaurus-related powers.

    Comic Books 

-   _Age of Reptiles_: Downplayed with the protagonist _Spinosaurus_ from "Ancient Egyptians". While it mostly acts like a normal animal, it can still be highly vicious at times, notably when he murders the offspring of a female _Spinosaurus_ in the hope of mating with her.
-   _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_: In the Don Rosa story "Return to Forbidden Valley", Scrooge and his nephews are at one point hunted down by a _Spinosaurus_ which is pretty eager to eat them. Since the story was written in the 1990s, this spinosaur is depicted as a carnosaur with a sail on its back as was commonly believed at the time.
-   _Fantastic Four_: In issue 345, a _Spinosaurus_ attacks the Fantastic Four and some military soldiers. Since the issue is from 1990, the Spino's head is more similar to that of a _T. rex_ than to the real animal.
-   _Flesh_: _Spinosaurus_ appear among the various predatory dinosaurs that overrun the Trans-Time base. Notably, this comic predates most other appearances of _Spinosaurus_ in fiction by almost 25 years.
-   _Jungle Girl_: The titular heroine is confronted to a very aggressive _Spinosaurus_ (that looks suspiciously similar to the one from _Jurassic Park III_) in the first two issues.
-   _Jurassic League_: Aquaman is a _Baryonyx_ and while still a hero, is characterized as more ruthless in comparison to the other Dinosaur heroes.

    Eastern European Animation 

-   _Pangea – The Neverending World_: A terrifying _Spinosaurus_ appears at the end of the film, where it tries to devour a baby _T. rex_.

    Fan Works 

-   _It's not the Raptor DNA_: Carnifex, son of the spinosaurus from _Jurassic Park III_, is an Ax-Crazy killer with severe mental instability who always loves to violently fight and has zero respect for tyrannosaurus rex. Rather fittingly, he's also the personal pet of current InGen CEO Daemon Bridges, the closest thing the story has to an overall Big Bad.
-   _The Bridge_: Subverted the trope with the Lost World RPG taking the place of _The Lost World: Jurassic Park_. The _Spinosaurus_ from _Jurassic Park III_, nicknamed "Snoke" by the players, is the apex predator of Isla Sorna. While it does menace the group when they stumble into its territory, as it chases down and wrecks the mobile trailers, it becomes something of an Anti-Hero as it kills the insane mercenary whom was chasing the expedition group. Later the players accidentally summoned it during the confrontation with the game's final boss, an Ultimasaurus, and Snoke engages the hybrid in a Behemoth Battle. Knowing the _Spinosaurus_ was the only thing that stood a chance at beating the hybrid, the expedition team help tilt the odds in Snoke's favor so he score a narrow victory. Afterwards, with no reason to attack the players, the _Spinosaurus_ leaves peacefully.
-   Subverted in _Dinosaur King Retold_, where Spiny the Spinosaurus is now a member of the D-Team rather than the Alpha Gang.
-   Played with in _Prehistoric Park Reimagined_. The spinosaurs featured are largely portrayed as simple animals trying to survive or likewise obeying their instincts both in the wild and in their subsequent new homes at the titular zoo. The spinosaurus, however, are nonetheless portrayed as animals that are very much not to be messed with lightly, if at all; particularly since they are hungry enough at the time to not only duel against carcharodontosaurus for the sake of opportunistically eating meat from an iguanodont carcass rather than spend large amounts of time trying to find the fish they usually like to eat, but also to swallow rescue team leader Drew after he interrupts their efforts at acquiring the iguanodont meat and proves luckless enough to be standing within their reach after they decide to give up the carcass as a result of said interruption.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs_: Rudy the giant, albino _Baryonyx_, is The Dreaded to most of the residents of the Lost World (even Momma T-rex) and is Buck the weasel's eternal nemesis.
-   _The Land Before Time_:
    -   A _Spinosaurus_ serves as the main antagonist of _The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers_.
    -   The villains in _The Land Before Time XIII: The Wisdom of Friends_ are a pack of _Baryonyx_ (albeit very inaccurately portrayed).

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Age of Dinosaurs_: A _Spinosaurus_ is one of the dinos rampaging in Los Angeles.
-   _The Hatchling_ ends with a _Suchomimus_ menacing the cast, eating a dog one of them owns.
-   _Jurassic Park_:
    -   _Jurassic Park III_ may very well be the Trope Codifier, with an antagonistic persistently predatory _Spinosaurus_ acting as the film's Big Bad. After surviving the first attack, Alan and Billy mention that the _Spinosaurus_ was never on InGen's officially disclosed list of the various species they had bred on the island, which makes Alan wonder what else they've been hiding. Supplementary material implies that it acted the way it did because of torturous experimentation in its youth.
    -   Smaller spinosaurid _Baryonyx_ pops up in _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_. One attempts to eat Claire and Franklin, whilst another is auctioned off at Lockwood Manor.
    -   _Jurassic World Dominion_ has a juvenile _Baryonyx_ using its jaws to decapitate Rainn Delacourt.
-   _Transformers: Age of Extinction_: Scorn the Dinobot turns into a mechanical _Spinosaurus_. While a hero (mostly), he's unarguably a savage who only submits to Optimus Prime's leadership after Optimus beats Grimlock in single combat. In battle, he delights in the destruction he can cause with his sword and sail spines.

    Literature 

-   _Dinotopia_ mostly averts this, with spinosaurids being portrayed no differently from other dinosaurs. Played very straight with Jagga, the Suchomimus antagonist of the novel _Survive!,_ however. As one supporting character says, "Jagga thinks life is killing and devouring."
-   _Animorphs_: _Megamorphs_ #2 has the team going back in time, where Rachel and Tobias meet a pair of spinosauri. The pair immediately decide to attack and try to eat them, even in the time travelers' _Deinonychus_ morphs, and don't give up until one gets knocked out by a stun gun carried by a member of an alien race that happens to have a base nearby.
-   Inverted in _Spiny_, a childrens' book where a _Spinosaurus_ family is the main focus, and are depicted positively.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Monsters Resurrected_: The first episode has an incredibly oversized<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  _Spinosaurus_ as an invincible monster that brutally kills all other creatures it encounters, including other giant theropods and an enormous crocodile, with only a single swipe of its claws. The documentary itself goes out of its way to describe how _Spinosaurus_ may as well have been the ultimate predatory dinosaur.
-   _Planet Dinosaur_: The first episode revolves around _Spinosaurus_, showing it hunting giant sawfish-like skates and later getting into a fight (which it wins) with a _Carcharodontosaurus_ over a carcass during a drought. However, it is zig-zagged in that the _Spinosaurus_ is portrayed as no more malicious than any other predator and its death at the end (implied to be a result of its injuries from the abovementioned fight) is portrayed in a tragic light.
-   _Primeval_: Zig-zagged. Whilst a _Spinosaurus_ appears as the villain in the fourth season premiere, it doesn't seem to be trying to eat anyone in spite of being a huge predator; it's just dangerous because it's a large, panicked animal in a populated area. When Conner and Abby wind up trapped in the past with the _Spinosaurus_, they seem to successfully establish a territory next to its that it stays out of. If it catches them out of their territory it will chase them back, but stops at the boundary.
-   _Terra Nova_: Downplayed in "Nightfall". An _Empirosaurus_ (a fictional cousin of _Spinosaurus_) attacks Terra Nova, but only because it was scared and hurt by the Sixers.
-   _Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger_: The summer movie _Gaburincho of Music_ introduces Zyudenryu Tobaspino, the first of the twenty-four Zyudenryu, which gets taken over by Ferocious Knight D (AKA "Deathryuger"), and serves as the main threat of the film. Even free of his control and allied with the team later in the series, Tobaspino is the most brutal of the Zyudenryu, as it forcibly seizes other Zyudenryu in a "Forced Biting Combination" to transform into a Zyuden Giant, which Daigo notes as it playing rougher than even Gabutyra.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: _Spinosaurus_ appears in the 3.0 _Monster Manual 2_ as a larger and more powerful dinosaur than the _Tyrannosaurus_ (which appeared in the core _Monster Manual_). In addition to being a Gargantuan creature instead of a Huge one (thus larger than a _Tyrannosaurus_ by the game's rules), it is also stronger, has powerful claw attacks in addition to its bite, and is able to unleash a Mighty Roar that induces the Frightened condition. It's also noted in the flavor text as being far more aggressive.
-   _Warhammer_: The forests of Lustria are home to numerous creatures that are dinosaurs in all but name (and the main reason there are no dragons in Lustria). One of the deadliest is the _Troglodon_, a spinosaur-like terrestrial creature that dwells in grottos and compensating its blindness with using whiskers and its tongue to track down prey. They are vicious and territorial creatures who will attack unprovoked, the only exceptions being fork-tailed Skinks who can instantly tame them.

    Video Games 

-   _ARK: Survival Evolved_:
    -   A variant of _Spinosaurus_, dubbed _Spinosaurus aquareliga_, is depicted as an intelligent and versatile hypercarnivore that feeds on both aquatic and terrestrial wildlife, regardless of size. Its divergence from its real life counterpart is actually justified here, however, in that this _Spino_ evolved its more formidable characteristics due to living on an island full of animals just as dangerous as it is (_Extinction_ retcons this with the reveal that all ARK creatures are genetically-engineered to reclaim Earth from The Corruption). It should be notable that, unlike most depictions, this _Spinosaurus_ follows the newer reconstructions as short-legged and semi-aquatic.
    -   _Baryonyx_ appears as well, and is very popular as a mount for water or caves due to its small size, relatively high attack power, fair jump distance, and ability to stun-lock swimming creatures with a spin attack. Unlike _Spinosaurus_, it cannot eat red meat, only fish (or kibble).
-   _Carnivores_: The sequel and its updated port, _Dinosaur Hunter_ has _Spinosaurus_ as one of the huntable dinosaurs and as a carnivore, it would immediately register you as prey if caught on sight. Amusingly, it is far smaller than the actual animal is, given the fact that it is hunted in-between _Velociraptor_ and _Ceratosaurus_ (the latter turns out to be bigger, no less).
-   _Dino Crisis 3_ has the player face off against a spinosaurus bioengineered for amphibiousness dubbed the Miaplacidus twice, which has three methods of attack: spitting high-pressure jets of water, bitting or clawing and swimming towards the player.
-   _Horizon Forbidden West_: The Slaughterspine is a combat machine with a design inspired by the spinosaurus, armed with an array of spine-shaped plasma cannons along its back and tail and a plasma beam launcher in its mouth, with its Apex counterpart being the highest-levelled machine in the game. This makes it stronger and even more deadly than its T. Rexpy counterpart, the Thunderjaw. However, they don't spawn near each other so Spinosaurus Versus T. rex is averted... Until the _Burning Shores_ DLC, which places a Thunderjaw and Slaughterspine next to each other, allowing players with the override codes to finally pit the two against each other.
-   _Jurassic Park_:
    -   _Warpath: Jurassic Park_ predates _Jurassic Park III_ in depicting _Spinosaurus_, and portrays it as a smaller theropod with a typical carnosaur-shaped head.
    -   Any video game tie-in to _Jurassic Park III_ is bound to have the _Spinosaurus_ either as the main antagonist or as the last and most powerful opponent to fight in a game.
        -   _Jurassic Park III: The Arcade:_ The _Spinosaurus_ is the first boss of the game, but doesn't stop there, soon tailing you behind as the second boss and persisting until the end, being the penultimate and last boss.
        -   _Jurassic Park III: Island Attack_: The _Spinosaurus_ is encountered early in the game and starts chasing Alan Grant in a segment that is meant to teach players how to dash. After that, it doesn't make an appearance until the last level where the chase is longer and more strenuous.
        -   _Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor_: _Spinosaurus_ is the last dinosaur to be encountered and is treated as a boss where it advances towards the Player Character at the treetops in an attempt to lunge towards it with a series of bites. Unusually, it uses its sail as a thrusting weapon, an aspect that obviously cannot be applied realistically to the dinosaur in any way.
        -   _Jurassic Park: Dinosaur Battles_: The _Spinosaurus_ is one of the six usable dinosaurs in the game, although it is the last one to be obtained. Two different types also serve as strong enemies in the last map of the game. The Final Boss is the _Prime Spinosaurus_ personally commanded by Dr. Corts who manages to provide a tough challenge (unless you're playing as the Ankylosaurus).
    -   A predating example of the above comes from the PS1 tie-in game of _The Lost World_ where _Baryonyx_ is the primary enemy of the first level of "The Hunter's" segment of the game. While strong and durable, the Hunter's variable weapon arsenal allows him to quickly dispatch of them.
    -   _Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis_: While one of the most popular dinosaurs to exhibit, the _Spinosaurus_ is also one of the most difficult to manage. It is a temperamental and territorial animal that, like the _Tyrannosaurus Rex_, demands that it needs live food for hunting and can quickly enter a Dino Rampage if left unchecked.
    -   _Jurassic World: Evolution_: The list of spinosaurids that can be cloned for a potential Jurassic World are _Spinosaurus_, _Baryonyx_ and _Suchomimus_. Downplayed in comparison to the other depictions as they can be sociable to members of their own kind and their social needs can be enhanced via the _Secrets of Dr. Wu_ DLC, and as far as other carnivores are concerned, all of them have a more tame stress level compared to the Hair-Trigger Temper of several large and smaller carnivores, making the spinosaurids less prone to trying to break out of their enclosure during a storm. That said, they are predators who will prey on other dinosaurs just as much as they do towards fish.
        -   Played straight with the _Spinoraptor_, a hybrid clone of the _Spinosaurus_ and the _Velociraptor_ who proves itself to be just as aggressive as its other hybrid contemporaries, the _Indominus Rex_ and the _Indoraptor_.
-   _Jurassic: The Hunted_: A _Spinosaurus_ nicknamed Spike is the final boss that relentlessly chases the heroes. At one point, it battles and kills a _T. rex_.
-   _ORION: Prelude_: _Spinosaurus_ is one of two large theropods in the game, alongside the _T. rex_ and is a vicious opponent that takes a lot of hits and is a persistent threat if encountered. The game's "Rampage Mode" also encourages players to play as dinosaurs, including _Spinosaurus_ and to wreak as much havoc as possible.
-   _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_ introduce the Ice/Dragon\-types Frigibax, Arctibax, and Baxcalibur, who can use their sails as bladed weapons.
-   _Primal Carnage_: _Spinosaurus_ is one of three dinosaurs that represent the "Tank" class, alongside _Tyrannosaurus rex_ and _Acrocanthosaurus_. As the name suggests, they are meant to be the powerhouse of the dinosaur faction of the game, compensating speed for strong attacks and defense. In regards to distinguishing itself from its contemporaries, Spinosaurus has more use of its arms and its roar raises fellow dinosaurs' defense. That said, it is the slowest out of the three.
-   _Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase_: The tie-in video game feature several _Spinosaurus_ (though they could also be the lesser known _Acrocanthosaurus_, given their shorter skulls and sails) appear as some of the most dangerous enemies in the prehistoric level.
-   _Zoo Tycoon_: _Spinosaurus_ is an adoptable dinosaur in the original game with the installation of the _Dinosaur Digs_ expansion pack, which was released around the same time as _Jurassic Park III_. While it also has been rendered outdated and inaccurate due to Science Marches On, it averts the Spinosaurus Versus T. rex trope due to being coded to always lose when pitted against a _T.rex_ (which is the most powerful animal in the game, only the _Deinosuchus_ having a chance against it). However, it's still extremely aggressive and will repeatedly attack the electric fences required to contain it.

    Web Animation 

-   _Dinosaur Office_: Some _Spinosaurus_ appear in a few episodes. Although they are a bit more civilized than most of the other examples on this page, they are still perfectly capable of attacking and devouring other characters when they are angry.

    Web Video 

-   One of the Starter Pokemon from _Pokemon Amber_ can evolve into a _Spinosaurus_\-based form called Spinozar who while difficult to tame at the start, can form a strong bond with you. It's Spliced-variant on the other hand, is far more destructive and uncontrollable.

    Western Animation 

-   _Dink, the Little Dinosaur_: A pack of _Spinosaurus_ threatens the protagonists in the episode "Mystery of the Broken Claw". In another episode, a _Baryonyx_ tries to eat Crusty. Notably, this series aired in the '80s, before we knew much about spinosaur anatomy or that the two species were even related, so _Spinosaurus_ is depicted as a generic carnosaur with a sail and walking in the old-fashioned tripod stance, while _Baryonyx_ is depicted as a quadruped, and a specialized turtle hunter (even though its narrow jaws were hardly suited for cracking shells).
-   _Dino Squad_: Averted with Fiona who turns into a Spinosaurus but is still one of the good guys.
-   _Dinosaur Train_: Subverted in "The Old Spinosaurus and the Sea". When Buddy and his family go to the Big Misty Seas, they are worried about the _Spinosaurus_ who lives there. However, when they meet him, he turns out to be a mostly friendly guy (if a bit grumpy) who only eats fish.
-   _Dinotrux_: Shredadons are the species of Dinotrux who are half-_Suchomimus_ and half-scrap metal shredder. They are very territorial species of Dinotrux who are even feared by scrap collectors due to their shredding mechanism rendering any unlucky Trux into the show equivalent of ludicrous gibs. This trope however gets subverted by one Shredadon who ultimately becomes friends with Ty and the gang after Ace repairs his trademark shredding mechanism.
-   _Gigantosaurus_: The Season 2 finale introduces Spino who arrives to terrorize Cretacia.
-   _Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous_ introduces a trio of _Baryonyx_ who hunt as a pack. When one is shot and killed, the other two specifically hunt down and kill the culprit. Season 4, meanwhile, reintroduces the _Spinosaurus_ from _Jurassic Park III_.
-   _Justice League Action_: Some _Spinosaurus_ are among the dinosaurs that ravage Booster's park in the episode "Booster's Gold".
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_:
    -   In the episode "Tempus Fugit" of the 2003 series, the heroes are sent to prehistoric times and are promptly attacked by a _Spinosaurus_.
    -   A robotic _Spinosaurus_ is used by the Triceratons to fight the turtles in the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ special _Half-Shell Heroes: Blast to the Past_.
-   _Teen Titans_: The _Jurassic Park III_ example is homaged in the final arc of season 4, when Beast Boy, Starfire and Cyborg have to fight evil duplicates of themselves. At one point Beast Boy transforms into a _T. rex_, while his evil clone transforms into a _Spinosaurus_ to fight back.
