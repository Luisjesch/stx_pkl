Your park is worse than your plight.

**Mildred**: Traffic warden? Mmm, well, you've been turned down for worse jobs. I suppose being turned down for this one is a step in the right direction.  
**George**: Oi, they might not turn me down. I've got all the qualifications.  
**Mildred**: What _qualifications_ are needed?  
**George**: None.  
**Mildred**: Right, you've got it.

Traffic wardens are civilian staff employed by the police to enforce parking laws. Their handiwork can be seen if you ever park in a prohibited area or let your meter run out for just one... damn... second!

The name "traffic warden" is most common in the United Kingdom. In America, the typical disparaging term is "meter maid" (used for either gender), though their official name in their municipality might be something like "parking enforcement officer."

Since the job is entirely limited to handing out tickets for breaking minor laws that most people feel immune to, they've acquired a reputation for being burdensome, petty and obnoxious, providing little benefit to society and generally just making things worse for everyone. Because of the hate, they're typically portrayed negatively. Of course, this is often shown to create a Vicious Cycle, where traffic wardens quickly become aggressive and mean because of the way they're treated by the public.

If a traffic warden shows up in media, expect tempers to be lost and arguments to follow.

Contrast with Meddlesome Patrolman.

    Advertising 

-   A McDonalds advert in the UK featured a traffic warden trying to put ticket on the windscreen of a monster truck.

    Comedy 

-   Constant targets for Jasper Carrott (and many other stand-up comics). "Some people, you give them a peaked cap and they start _building camps!_"
-   On sketch starts with a man in the street who sees a cop writing a ticket for a car with an expired meter in front of City Hall.
    
    "I'm not paying that."  
    "Say what?"  
    "I'm not paying a cent of that fine."  
    "No?"  
    The cop finishes writing up the ticket, then starts a new one.  
    "Then how about one for the broken tail light?"  
    "Nope."  
    "The tires are worn."  
    "Don't care."  
    "The license plate is dirty!"  
    "Fine by me."  
    Finally the cop runs out of faults to find (and tickets) and smugly looks at the man, who shrugs and walks away. Then the mayor comes out of city hall with his car keys in hand to find his windshield covered in tickets...
    

    Comic Books 

-   _Gaston Lagaffe_:
    -   Gaston's (who interprets No Parking Allowed signs as parking spots no-one ever occupies) longtime foe Longtarin, who while an actual cop, seemingly lives only to give parking tickets. Their rivalry sometimes reaches escalating prank war proportions.
    -   A one-panel gag shows Gaston having crashed his car into a parking meter... and putting a coin in it anyway, under Longtarin's glare.
    -   One strip has Gaston deploy a robot with a buzzsaw that starts cutting down the meter. When Longtarin confiscates it, Gaston retaliates with a dog-shaped robot that pees on the meter. Revolted by its sheer tastelessness, Longtarin turns his back on it, so he doesn't see the dog is little more than a four-legged reservoir of concentrated acid.
    -   One strip has Longtarin lying in wait for the meter to expire with seconds left to go... then Gaston's gull flaps down with a coin in its beak, inserts it, and flies off, reducing Longtarin to tears.
    -   Longtarin has a Catchphrase: "Is that a traffic sign or a giant lollipop?" Naturally, Gaston uses it against him.
    -   Gaston leaves a gas reservoir in his car but forgets to close it. Longtarin approaches to write it up... and the car lifts off in front of him, driving him a to a nervous breakdown.
    -   Gaston parks under a tree in front of a No Parking sign, right under Longtarin's nose. As the patrolman readies his notebook, Gaston reassures him, hooks the car's roof to a chain dangling from the tree, then hauls it straight up, revealing he'd installed a pulley system on the tree.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _The World Is Not Enough_, James Bond splashes two wardens (played by those featured in _Clampers_) in a tight turn with the Q-Boat. Many cinema audiences in the UK cheered at this scene. Amusingly, the wardens were _not_ told just how wet they were going to get (a small reservoir worth of water soaks them).
-   _Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels_ has a traffic warden held prisoner by the criminals and beaten up, then recovered by the heroes — who can't resist beating him up themselves.
    
    **Eddie:** I fucking hate traffic wardens.

    Literature 

-   In _Good Omens_ the angel and demon protagonists both come upon a traffic warden writing a ticket, and both assume traffic wardens were created by the other's faction.
-   When Sergeant Colon and Corporal Nobbs found themselves in charge of the _Discworld_\-equivalent of this department ("A chance to be 'self-financing' and not be shot at"), the over-zealous clamping policy went so far as to include _buildings_ as targets, including the Opera House and the Patrician's Palace. It _could_ be argued that buildings do impede the flow of traffic somewhat.... Of course, Colon is a reasonable man and recognizes that Vetinari was parked on business. He's also willing to overlook the offense if the accused presents credible evidence of a free pint, a free meal, and/or information. Possibly the best trick they pulled (subsequently busted by Vetinari) was for Nobby to disguise himself as an old woman and cross the road extremely slowly in front of oncoming traffic, getting people to stop long enough that Colon could ticket them.
-   In the Tom Holt novel _Who's Afraid of Beowulf?_, the heroes find their vehicle has been clamped while they were in the museum. The king responds to this by drawing his sword and cutting the clamps off. All bystanders cheer.
-   One of the few sympathetic portrayals of traffic wardens was in the Julian Symons novel _A Three Pipe Problem_. Needing eyes on the streets, the hero Sheridan Hayes recruits the local traffic wardens: they know the streets, are out every day, and no-one pays them any attention.
-   _Wolf in Shadow_ takes the problems with privatizing this position to its natural extreme: the rights to ticketing cars in one neighborhood are purchased by the local crime boss, who turns it into an outright extortion racket. At one point they clamp the car of one of the heroes, despite it clearly being labeled a police vehicle. Said hero beats the clampers to a pulp with his bare hands, to the general cheers of all witnesses.

    Live-Action TV

-   _Red Dwarf_:
    -   In the episode "Camille", Lister tries to break Kryten's programming and teach him to lie. Succeeding, Kryten describes a banana as a "small, off-duty Czechoslovakian traffic warden", which was changed to Tasmanian in the Czech dub, perhaps because that country does not have them.
    -   In the episode "Back to Reality", the crew wake up to find that Red Dwarf was a virtual reality program. Kryten's real identity turns out to be "Agent Jack Bullit of cybernautics".

Neither the men of Blue Watch nor the police officer who initially responded bother to hide their amusement.

    Radio 

-   _That Mitchell and Webb Sound_ had a series of sketches called "Old Lady Job Justification Hearings," in which people have to explain what they do and "how it _helps_" before a panel of kind but firm old ladies. These include a snotty futures trader, a snotty PR guy, and the two comedians themselves, who are all gradually brought to realize that their careers are a waste of time. However, the one about a traffic warden has him start off as depressed because everyone's so down on traffic wardens, until the old ladies' questions give him a chance to explain that the rules he enforces are necessary and known to all drivers and that parking tickets provide a lot of revenue to the city. They declare his job a good one and reward him with cake.
-   One of Denis Norden's monologues on _My Word!_ has him meeting an old girlfriend who is now "walking the streets", by which he turns out to mean she's a traffic warden. The reveal that he still carries a packet of the Curiously Strong Peppermints that were a part of their courtship encourages her to overlook that he's overrun his parking meter. He doesn't tell her that he's been feeding them _into_ the meter, because they happen to be the same size as a 10p coin.
