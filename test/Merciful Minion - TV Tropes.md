Even the most hands-on villain can't take care of imprisoning or killing _all_ the heroes personally. Ordering an underling to attend to such duties is common. Sometimes, the underling volunteers to "deal with" the hero ... and releases him instead.

There are several possible explanations. Perhaps the underling is a mole in the villain's organization. Perhaps the underling feels he "owes" the hero and chooses this form of repayment. Perhaps the underling is going through a Mook–Face Turn, or simply expects the good guys to win and wants to score points toward a pardon.

A variant occurs when the minions receive a letter ordering an execution from a king, often of his mysterious bride. They often exile the bride, so that when the king returns, he will not be able to carry out the sentence. The letter has usually been tampered with.

Compare to If You're So Evil, Eat This Kitten! (where the villain orders an underling to "take care" of the hero as a loyalty test), Alone-with-Prisoner Ploy (which is just as likely to be information-passing as "time to escape"), Pet the Dog (where the villain shows some kindness to highlight their redeeming qualities), Even Evil Has Standards, Minion with an F in Evil, Helpful Mook, and Noble Demon. Can overlap with Death Faked for You. Contrast with Sparing the Final Mook, where a hero spares an overmatched mook, usually after defeating a whole group of other mooks.
