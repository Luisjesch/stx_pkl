This is an offshoot of the Stock Light-Novel Hero that stars an Everyman and Non-Action Guy. He's usually in a world that's Like Reality, Unless Noted or Urban Fantasy. He can have a variety of "mundane" jobs, such as an Ordinary High-School Student, Salaryman, NEET or a Hikikomori not far from what we'd see in Real Life. Sometimes he's even a Light Novel author or videogame creator himself.

The main and _most important_ difference between the Everyman and his Hero counterpart is that fighting is _rare_ for him. While the Stock Light-Novel Hero is usually expected to fight or defeat a Villain of the Week or Arc Villain and frequently gains cool or stylish new abilities to combat new foes, the Stock Light-Novel Everyman is either a Non-Action Guy or he is expected to solve more mundane problems. The sort of problems he and his True Companions encounter are defeated with words or guile rather than fists. His Unique Protagonist Assets are based on social, academic or career talents, such as having Awesomeness by Analysis or being The Heart or Living Emotional Crutch of his social group.

For the Heroes, the story often picks up right when there's some sort of Call to Adventure, or they begin training/education for some sort of special or important destiny. The Everyman's story, however, starts when he's made some brand new acquaintances, made some sort of achievement or found himself in the middle of some kind of trouble, mystery or wacky misadventures, but otherwise his normal, mundane life is uninterrupted.

Appearance-wise, he differs from both the Stock Light-Novel Hero _and_ Stock Shōnen Hero, in that he is often not quite as Bishōnen as the former, but also not as wild, unkempt or macho as the latter. He is Ridiculously Average right down to his appearance. Some examples even have "dead" or drooping eyes that make them seem aloof, hostile or disinterested or Idiot Hair that emotes on its own.

Also, unlike his "Hero" counterparts, he often has more Classical Anti-Hero qualities: more flaws, doubts or moral failings. Of course, when backed into a corner, he will usually do the right thing, and is much more likely to act on Enlightened Self-Interest than genuine altruism.

_Like_ his other counterpart, however, this type of character also often gains a "harem" of Love Interests who fight or compete over him, and in some cases, gaining said harem _is_ the Inciting Incident and focus of the story. Because of this, some examples may outright overlap with a standard Harem Genre protagonist.

Compare and contrast the Unfazed Everyman, which some of these characters can be if they have a particularly strong Weirdness Censor.
