Some things can't be un-seen. Or un-heard.

AKA the male orgasm.

While women situate themselves between The Modest Orgasm and The Immodest Orgasm, due to the Double Standard, males are usually not shown climaxing on screen/panel. Or it's very brief.

But not always.

When a male is shown experiencing a particularly intense climax, he generally can't control himself either and utters grunting sighs and growls instead of the more typically female yelps and squeals. It can go up to an utter scream, but that's rare. It is often accompanied with a gritty or silly face, rolled eyes, clenched teeth, and foretold by naughty words and sweat. Is sometimes featured/parodied in Orgasmic Combat.

In the event that a man attempts to fake this, expect his partner to be unconvinced.

Compare/Contrast The Modest Orgasm and The Immodest Orgasm. Can be Truth in Television, though it is sometimes exaggerated in fiction to make the hero seem macho.

-   In _Ah... and Mm... Are All She Says_, Tanaka advises Toda to focus more on the female character's face than the male's during a climax scene, since most of the hentai magazine's readers are (presumably heterosexual) males.
-   _Guts_ in the third Golden Age Arc movie during the love scene with Casca.
-   One particular mention goes to the infamous "goosh goosh" _Tokyo Tribe 2_ scene. Not for the faint of heart.

    Literature 

-   The title character of _Sabriel_ overhears one in the next room of an inn.
-   A common theme in Alexei Kremzar's books, including _Educating Sarah._
-   Simona Ahrnstedt combines this with The Immodest Orgasm in her sex scenes. And she's got plenty of them.
-   At the low end of the grunting scale, in Kurt Vonnegut's _Slaughterhouse-Five_, "Billy made a noise like a small, rusty hinge. He had just emptied his seminal vesicles into Valencia."
-   In _The Life And Opinions Of Tristram Shandy_ the elder Mr. Shandy believes the quality of the (male) orgasm determines the quality of the offspring. He is approaching a great climax with his wife when she deflatingly asks him if he remembered to wind up the clock, a household chore in those days. He forever after blames the resulting paltry dribble for his son Tristram being such a disappointment. The book was written in 1759.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Fellow Travelers_:
    -   During Christmastime, Hawkins Fuller performs fellatio on his lover Tim Laughlin, and the latter grunts when he orgasms.
    -   In 1957, Tim is the "giving" partner when he and Hawk are engaged in anal sex, and the former muffles his orgasm by biting and sucking on the latter's shoulder while groaning in pleasure.
-   On one episode of _Frasier,_ Lilith and Frasier happen to both go to the same summer weekend retreat with their dates. Believing that Lilith is having sex in the next room, Frasier starts leaping up and down on his bed making certain noises. He takes the silence he's met with as a sign that Lilith is enjoying herself even more. In reality, she's out having a stroll, and she walks in as he's getting into it. To add to his embarrassment, his girlfriend walks in, too.
-   Done many, many times in _Game of Thrones_ (Tyrion Lannister is introduced during one), and one of Theon Greyjoy's makes him look like he is being electrocuted.
-   Two short instances in _Glee_ features the character Finn do this TWICE, each time VERY noticeable to the audience by his expression and his grunts and groans. This, however, isn't as big as other examples, usually just down to a couple of "oh"s and finally a grunt when he unsuccessfully tries to stop it.
-   Frank in _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_ gets his own entire gratuitous sex scene in _Lethal Weapon 5_ (as his demand for funding the movie). No one else enjoyed that scene.
-   _Law & Order: UK_. As the detectives and prosecutors watch the tape of CP Alesha Philips' rape, DS Matt Devlin stands as far away as possible and turns his back (he's in love with her). Unfortunately, he can still hear everything and visibly cringes when her assailant lets out one of these.
-   Trevor from _MTV's Pets_ does this often while masturbating.
-   Done various times in the short lived softcore series _Nightcap_.
-   Several years ago, _Saturday Night Live_ did a parody of the Herbal Essences commercials, with "Herbal Essences" for men. A bunch of men in a court room, washing their hair, and making grunting noises. Here is a newer version of this...
-   Male characters orgasming in _The Tudors_ tend to do this a lot.

    Music 

-   Parodied by Eminem in a skit on _The Slim Shady LP_.
-   Such grunts form a (ridiculous) part of the intro to Elastica's "Line Up". (It's a song about groupies, so it's totally appropriate, guys)
-   "Hot Shot", by Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, could be read as some hammering Wham, a strangled Bam, and a very perfunctory Thank You Ma'am.
-   Heard in Rammstein's "Rein Raus"
-   The Stranglers' _Peaches_ has a fairly unambiguous bit towards the end where singer Hugh Cornwell gets, me er, _'overcome_ by all the comely ladies in bikinis he is ogling on the beaches. On stage he even _mimed_ masturbation, to make it clear to those who hadn't got the idea what the grunting noises betokened.
-   The rhythmic male and female grunts in Fleetwood Mac's "Big Love" seem to indicate this.
-   The voice constantly panting "undercover" near the end of Alan O'Day's "Undercover Angel" also suggests this.

    Video Games 

-   Jason Brody has one in the bad ending of _Far Cry 3_. Then he dies.
-   The Player Characters of the _Five Nights in Anime_ games have hilariously cartoonish moans whenever receiving Out with a Bang at the hands of the lusty enemies.
-   _Duke Nukem 3D_: the titular Duke during the ending does some pretty loud grunts with a babe who wanted some more _action_. Thankfully it's not shown.
-   Similar to FNIA, _Only Cans_ has the talking soda cans make hilariously cartoonish moaning, hissing, and fizzing sounds when the player spritzes them.

    Webcomics 

-   _Ménage à 3_: Male responses in the comic's numerous sex scenes vary, but some occasionally make some noise. Notably, Gary's first time involves a very audible "virginnnnGhhggnnn", to Kiley's shock. (Strip #539, December 15, 2011, NSFW.)
-   _Sandra on the Rocks_: Pierre's first time with Sandra produces some fairly restrained but audible moans of "Oh Sandra". What neither of them know, unfortunately, is that they have witnesses at that moment — and Eloise isn't going to take this scene well.

    Web Original 

-   Subverted in the "Thanksgiving" episode of _The Damn Few._ Sealy's (off-screen) falsetto barks and squeals top out in an ecstatic, "mmmmmmmI'matopsecretNavy_SEAL_!!!!!"
-   Subverted by The Nostalgia Critic. Whenever he reenacts an orgasm (and trust us, he's done it a lot), there's no grunts involved, just high-pitched gasping and squealing. But then the character is pretty girly anyway.
-   Also subverted with SiIvaGunner infamous meme character Loud Nigra, who does a very, very loud and overly long scream when he's orgasming.
-   The infamous _Shrek is Love Shrek is Life_ incarnation of the epynomous ogre has the tendency of letting out a mighty roar when he reaches his _climax_. Can also be considered a rare male example of The Immodest Orgasm.
-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_:
    -   Vegeta during the hysterical scene in episode 34 where he and Bulma conceives Trunks. Complete with Galick Gun.
    -   Other episodes indicate this is the case for other (every?) male characters, such as a non-canon scene between Future Gohan and Bulma with a Masenko, Goku and Chi-Chi with a Kamehameha while conceiving Goten, or Krillin with a Scatter Bullet that destroys the Krillin Owned Counter.
-   Zabuza (also voiced by Lanipator) at the beginning of episode 6 of Naruto The Abridged Comedy Fandub Spoof Series Show.

    Western Animation 

-   Parodied in the episode "Altruists" of _The Ren & Stimpy Show Adult Party Cartoon_, a scene of sawing a log is INCREDIBLY heavily implied to represent a homosexual sex scene, complete with begging and a very joyous Grunting Orgasm from Stimpy. See it for yourself (NSFW, obviously).
-   Cleveland in _Family Guy._ "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH-and boom goes the dynamite."
    -   Peter makes a loud moan when he finishes with Bonnie in a parody of _The Great Gatsby_.
-   Brock Sampson in _The Venture Brothers_, as his old college roommate Rusty can attest.
-   _South Park_: Randy Marsh in the episode Over Logging as he jacks off to internet porn. His moans are so loud that the characters outside thought he was being attacked by a tiger.
