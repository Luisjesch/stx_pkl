**Maeve:** He's having dick problems.  
**Adam:** Yeah? What would you know, Wiley?  
**Maeve:** Girls talk, clodpole. Aimee said you can't cum.

Anorgasmia is the inability to reach orgasm.

In popular culture, the person with anorgasmia is usually female and just as often heterosexual. Either she has trouble reaching a sexual climax by masturbating, or she has never had a partner who was able to sexually satisfy her. The woman might start faking orgasms, just to please her partner or out of fear of embarrassing him.

Almost without exception she will eventually experience orgasm in the end. Either by discovering a way to successfully masturbate herself or, more commonly, by finding the right partner or having her current partner learn how to do it properly. When the partner eventually reaches orgasm it is usually combined with The Immodest Orgasm, as if all her year-long frustrations are finally yelled out in one extravagant finale. Can also be combined with Bigger Is Better in Bed.

This trope is popular in erotic stories, but also in more mainstream scenarios. Can be both Played for Laughs and Played for Drama.

Anorgasmia is also Truth in Television. More women than their partners would dare to admit encounter anorgasmia in relationships at some time. Even though both partners might be tempted to blame the other, it can be attributed to other factors, such as stress, traumatic experiences, a Paralyzing Fear of Sexuality, an Incompatible Orientation, certain (physical and mental) health issues, or certain medications (such as antidepressants, or even _birth control pills_). Also, contrary to what popular culture often preaches, it's not something that is always "solved" if you have reached it once. Even in happy and stable relationships, it's possible that occasionally a partner might be unable to have an orgasm. Only when it occurs so often that it puts a strain on the relationship can it become a problem.

Even though in Real Life men can encounter this problem too it doesn't occur that much in popular culture. When male anorgasmia does appear in stories, it's usually considered a desirable mark of exceptional stamina — even though the inability to ejaculate can be very frustrating and even painful for men. The fact that some men can ejaculate without experiencing an orgasm is practically inexistent in popular culture.

This is also an increasingly prevalent problem thanks to the increasing use of anti-depressants (for reasons why consult your personal socialreformician). Many anti-depressants can make it difficult or impossible to achieve orgasm or (worse?), make it possible to achieve orgasm _without the associated pleasure_. Whoof. People who experience this tend, for reasons obvious to many, to reach a depressive state equivalent to that they'd hoped to escape.

Compare Lousy Lovers Are Losers, where the lack of orgasm _is_ one partner's fault.

See Wikipedia for more information on the subject and consult a sexologist if you need advice.

Also not to be confused with people desperately trying to avoid having an orgasm.

    Anime and Manga 

-   The main plotline of _Nageki no Kenkō Yūryōji_, known in the US as _F3: Frantic, Frustrated, and Female_. Hiroe Ogawa is suffering this trope, and the story is about the various (unsuccessful) attempts to resolve this.
-   Played seriously in _Futari Ecchi_ when Yura had a bout of not feeling anything during sex and not reaching a climax due to being completely exhausted from the summer heat.
-   A male example that's played for drama in the hentai manga _Secret Plot Deep_. Wholesome Crossdresser Yuya gets together with classmate Mari, who has just confessed that she's in love with him...but during the ensuing sex, while she has multiple orgasms over the course of an hour, Yuya doesn't even orgasm once, which frustrates Mari to the point of crying and blaming herself for not being an effective enough lover. Yuya has to assure her that the problem isn't with _her,_ but with _him;_ as it turns out, his inability to climax is because he had previously been raped by Mayumi, which in turn compounded the complex he'd already been suffering due to his cross-dressing (which Yuya took up in the first place because of a rather _warped_ home situation with his parents loving his deceased twin sister more than him and mistaking him for her when he came out of the shower one day). As a result of all that, Yuya admits, he can't climax normally no matter how he wishes he could. Yuya eventually confides that the only way he can climax is by being on the receiving end of anal penetration, which Mari happily provides.

    Comic Books 

-   Konstantin Romanov from _Nikolai Dante_ while maintaining his Secret Identity as the Lord Protector routinely has both male and female sex workers sent to him. When he suggests to one seductress that they take a break in the middle of sex, she notes that he hasn't orgasmed. He tells her that he never does. The act itself is mostly just to remind himself that he still lives after Nikolai left him for dead aboard the _Potemkin_ during the war. In any case, Konstantin tends to burn his sexual partners to death once he's done with them.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Red Ears_: Played for Laughs in this comic strip.

    Literature 

-   In Michael Moorcock's "Gloriana" the titular queen is forever bemoaning the fact that she can't have orgasms, and because of the palace's peculiar acoustics, the entire court can hear her. Of course, when she finally does the entire court gets to hear that as well.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Cowboy Bebop (2021)_. Faye Valentine has her first orgasm (that she remembers, as she has no memory of who she was before being woken from being a Human Popsicle) with lesbian Wrench Wench Mel.

-   _House of the Dragon_: Daemon's sexuality is deeply rooted to his emotions, and if he's feeling bad or worrying about something else, he can't do it. He struggles to finish with Mysaria in episode 1.01, at least in part because he's upset that his brother will replace him with a new heir. He breaks off their sexual encounter and sullenly wraps a Security Blanket around himself, while Mysaria assures him that no one can replace him. In episode 1.04, Daemon nopes out of a sexual encounter in a very Ambiguous Situation. In isolation there's no reason to think it relates to his ability to perform sexually, but in this context of his broader sexual history, it's a possible reason. In episode 1.05 we meet Daemon's despised, divorced-in-all-but-name wife Rhea, who mocks him about being unable to finish. However, Daemon's sexual problems are very contextual. He goes on to sire six children under what's implied to be circumstances where he feels more secure.
-   _Scrubs_ features an episode in which Turk and Carla are about to have sex, then the camera moves to the side... then back, to see them both laying in bed looking distraught, and Turk says, "That's never happened to me before," heavily implying that Turk was unable to perform or finished too quickly. Later, as each is talking about what went wrong to their respective friends, it's revealed that Turk was fine, but Carla couldn't have an orgasm. They work it out by talking about the anxiety she was feeling about them having become more serious and all the things that could be wrong now that they were getting closer instead of just having fun together

    Music 

-   Frank Zappa: On the album _Fillmore East, June 1971_ the track "Do You Like My New Car?" features a sketch where Mark plays himself, while Howie plays a groupie who is in awe of Mark's "professionalism as a rockstar." Yet she tells him that she's "unable to come" unless he sings "his big hit song to her." Being part of The Mothers Of Invention Mark of course never had a hit single, but since he used to be a member of The Turtles too he just sings "Happy Together" to her. This sketch was also based on reality, as Mark did once encounter a groupie who had this request.

    Webcomics 

-   _Ménage à 3_:
    -   Amazonian sex goddess DiDi is, for the first several years of the strip, unable to reach orgasm during sex. This is largely because men are overwhelmed with her beauty and can only last a few seconds with her, but on one occasion Peggy performs cunnilingus on her until Peggy's jaw goes numb, without solving the problem; in addition, she appears to fake satisfaction to avoid disappointing her boyfriends. Her desperate need for an orgasm leads to increasingly jerkish behavior. She _does_ eventually shake this problem, but then gets the impression that the orgasm meant she's in love and enters Stalker with a Crush mode.
    -   Sandra admits to problems reaching orgasms in an early strip, but this seems to be less of a problem for her; there are hints that she reaches climax sometimes when drunk, if only because it inspires her to have bizarrely kinky sex.
