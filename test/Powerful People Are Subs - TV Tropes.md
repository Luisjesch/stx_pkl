"I don't want to hear another sound out of you, not a moan, not a grunt, nothing. But if you can be good, I might just have a little treat for you."

**Luke Skywalker**: He kept calling me "Skywalker". Because I don't have a title — I'm not a senator, I'm not a general any longer, I'm not an ambassador. He used the word like an insult.  
**Mara Jade Skywalker**: He could have called you "Master". Like I do sometimes.  
**Luke**: I don't think it would be the same as when you do it.  
**Mara**: It better not be... _Skywalker_.

There's an old cliche that people in positions of authority tend to be submissive when it comes to sex. For one reason or another, they prefer being subs in BDSM or are otherwise submissive during sex. This often relates to power-play. Another reason why this trope can occur is that the person is a leader most of the time so they enjoy having someone else take the role instead.

This often pops up as a joke as well. For example, the serious executive, or another high-ranking individual, has a secret thing for dominant females. This is to a certain extent Truth in Television, much to the delight of unscrupulous journalists everywhere (many a politician has had their career ended after being busted with a dominatrix). Of course, this is not always the case. Indeed, many people are very consistent: wanting to be either leaders or followers in all aspects of their life.

Compare to Aggressive Submissive for when someone has an aggressive personality but does a 180 when it comes to anything sexual, and Brains and Bondage for when BDSM is favored by smart people (who are often powerful as well). For the non-BDSM variation, see Authoritative in Public, Docile in Private. See also Best Her to Bed Her and All Amazons Want Hercules, where the person is only willing to love someone that's stronger than they are.

-   _Nana & Kaoru_: Female lead Nana Chigusa is the vice president of the student council and aspires to be an attorney, but you wouldn't know it when she's having one of her "breathers" with her boyfriend and dom Kaoru Sugimura. It's in large part a stress relief outlet for her from the expectations of being the school's star student and athlete.

    Comic Books 

-   At one point in _The Losers_, Aisha follows her target (the immensely feared warden of a Hellhole Prison) to the brothel where he goes to be dominated. She waits until the dominatrix has him tied up before entering, chases the woman out, and takes a moment to note the irony of a man who is so feared and has literally decided if others live or die on a whim being in such a predicament. Then she goes to work on him Jack Bauer style.

    Fan Works 

-   The _Harry Potter_ fic “Different manor” explores the idea that Harry fundamentally resents the responsibility he’s been forced to take on due to the prophecy and his status as the "Boy-Who-Lived", to the extent that one of the reasons he falls for Daphne Greengrass is that she takes charge and just asks him to submit to her, basically allowing him to get away from his responsibilities and let her deal with things. Even when presented with the power of the Elder Wand (which is noted to have a corruptive influence on most of its wielders), Daphne reflects that the Wand can’t work on Harry because all he truly wants is to submit to her rather than to rule on his own (Daphne is tempted by the wand herself but is able to put that desire aside by focusing on her desire for Harry himself).
-   In the _Star Wars Legends_ fanfic _Encounter on Myrkr_ (NSFW), Mara accuses Luke of being one and claims she knows the type (in the end, it is revealed to be a little role-playing, so the veracity of her statement is unknown):
    
    "I saw men like you - powerful, rich, men with connections, men who held the power of life and death over others in their very hands. They would come to the lowliest and vile drinking establishments to slum with the locals. They came for one reason, one particular kind of woman... These powerful men who had others trembling at their feet wanted a woman to dominate them. They wanted to feel helpless at the hands of another. They got a sick sexual arousal out of being abused and degraded. That is the kind of type I think you are."
    
-   A _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_ fic _So Let's Go Home and Draw the Curtains_ set after the Crimson Flower storyline has Edelgard publicly as the powerful, strong, and independent emperor of Adrestia, who keeps Byleth merely as a lowly advisor and aide that nobody acknowledges. In private, they are secretly married and he is unquestionably the dominant in their bedroom, as she finds joy in letting go of her responsibilities by submitting to him and treating him as her master.
-   Implied in _A Good Compromise_, which opens with professor and combat veteran Captain Tyria Sark engaging in some light bondage with her husband where she's the one tied down.
-   _My Pain, My Thrill_ revolves around Princess Peach finding out that she's a masochist. The problem is that her lover, the equally powerful King Bowser, _isn't_ a sadist. He Does Not Know His Own Strength and tends to leave scars during sex, but he hates seeing Peach injured, even if she consents to it.
-   Luo Binghe in _A Thorn Amongst The Flowers_ is a fearsome Demon Emperor that won't hesitate to lord his authority around. However, he happily and rather eagerly allows his First Consort to bind him in rope and verbally dominate him — said Consort notes that even if Luo Binghe intended for the session to be some kind of apology towards him, the guy is a little too into it.
-   The _RWBY_ fanfic _Vale's Underground_ makes Cinder an example. She's a psychopathic, sadistic mob boss who keeps everyone under her thumb. However, she also seems to enjoy it when guys are rough with her during sex.

I know you liked playing the good-boy role, but for you, it sometimes seemed like just a role that you liked playing, like a lot of you educated professional types—whether gay, straight, or 'straight, but…'—do, and then when you're done playing, you put your expensive Italian suits back on and go back to being yourselves. That's not what I wanted. I wanted something that was really real."
