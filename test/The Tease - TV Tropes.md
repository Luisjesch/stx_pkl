_"Favours to none, to all she smiles extends."_

This trope describes a person who loves to flirt with others and playfully generate sexually interest, often from the main character. Maybe they'll try Erotic Eating a chocolate-dipped strawberry. Maybe they'll sidle sensually or walk with an extra sway in their step, accentuating her elegant legs near their target. Maybe she'll go all the way and outright hint at an _offer_ of sex. Almost always, the teased person will act in various comical ways. As you can imagine, this trope is often used for Fanservice, teasing the audience as much as the characters, because Sex Sells.

Certain characters only tease their Love Interest: in those cases the teasing is romantic, with the In-Universe expectation that they will eventually hook up. This trope can very easily overlap with Ready for Lovemaking if a character in an Official Couple teases their lover. Other characters tease people just for the hell of it. If the target is Not Distracted by the Sexy, expect The Tease to become frustrated and either give up or up the teasing to dangerous levels. (Possibly mixed with a morality plot if the target suddenly decides to accept an "offer" that The Tease never expected to be taken up on.)

Occasionally, this behavior is given a dramatic justification: it's revealed that this insincere sexual aggression is really a way of feeling powerful and in control, covering up deep-seated emotional insecurities, thus explaining why they can never act on them. See Tsundere and Yandere for other common ways fictional character cover their emotional insecurities.

This trope is often associated with the Hard-Drinking Party Girl and is a standard tactic of The Vamp and the Femme Fatale. Male examples often overlap with The Casanova if they'll flirt with literally anyone. It is not to be confused with either the Innocent Fanservice Girl, or a character who usually doesn't tease people, but ends up in a certain situation requiring them to Show Some Leg.

Compare with The Gadfly, a nonsexual version of this trope to provoke a reaction for amusement. Also compare with Shameless Fanservice Girl. Not to be confused with The Teaser.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   Botan from _7 Seeds_ reveals this side of hers later on. She has no problem being (half) naked in front of other people and is even willing to give some eye candy in order to distract someone.

-   Leone from _Akame ga Kill!_ shamelessly flirts with Tatsumi. She constantly shoves his face into her breasts, violates his personal space, pries into his love life, and even _licked his face_ to mark him as her own. However, given that she blushes whenever he treats her nice it's subtly implied that she does develop a real interest in him. Though that still doesn't stop her from continuing her flirtatious behavior towards him.
-   Riko Mine Lupin IV in _Aria the Scarlet Ammo_. She knows that Kinji's Hysteria Mode is triggered by sexual arousal and shamelessly takes advantage of this (and of the information she has about his brother) to be very... _close_ to him — under the pretext of helping him activate HSS at will, but Kinji doesn't really buy it. Later, though, she understands that Kinji is more aroused by Aria than by her, and does such things as imitating Aria's voice in a sensual tone or licking her neck in front of him. Yes, her Tease status actually has a practical use.
-   Aiko from _Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts_ is this to the extreme, any appearance she makes is to tease boys, especially Tsuchiya. And when she says she's not wearing any panties or a bra, she is very likely telling the truth.
-   _Bakemonogatari_ has _nine minutes straight_ of Hitagi starting naked, getting dressed and undressed again in front of Koyomi. Then the next episode starts with her talking about how beautiful she is and constantly skipping for absolutely no reason at all. They did not long after.
-   In _Bleach_, Yoruichi likes to show herself naked in front of Ichigo, because of his hilarious reactions.
-   Dokuro from _Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan_ acts this way to the main character Sakura, when she's not brutally murdering him with her giant club.
-   Hagino from _Blue Drop_ starts doing this toward Mari as she gradually breaks through her composed stance.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_:
    -   Mikoto's mother Misuzu is happy to crush her boobs against Touya's arm while he's showing her something. Though apparently he's just as much of a harem protagonist as his son Touma, so maybe it's not really Misuzu's fault. His wife Shina certainly blames him more than Misuzu.
    -   Touma thinks Lessar is doing this when she keeps flipping up her skirt and talking about seducing him. She's actually trying to seduce him to tie him more closely to England (though she _does_ like him for real). Touma is not amused.
        
        **Lessar:** What's wrong with you!? You should just do what any man would and jump me already!  
        **Touma:** I don't think there's anyone on the planet who would blame me if I slugged you for what you just said.
        
    -   WORST, the Evil Twin of the MISAKA network, tries to seduce Accelerator with some Erotic Eating. It completely fails, since he views the clones as somewhere between his sisters and his daughters, but definitely _not_ love interests.
        
        **Misaka Worst:** Should Misaka use her tongue seductively as she licks \[the ice cream\]?  
        **Accelerator:** Who are you trying to please by doing that? Yourself?  
        **Misaka Worst:** Well, there is that. If it would be devastating to your relationship with Last Order, Misaka will let you touch her tits and ass, but doing it now would seem rather pointless.
        
-   _Don't Toy with Me, Miss Nagatoro_ can be pretty much summarized as Nagatoro sexually teasing Senpai all the time while calling him a pervert.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Bulma's mother, Panchy, is rather flirty in both _Dragon Ball_ and _Dragon Ball Z_.
    -   Bulma's _daughter_ inherited the teasing trait. It was shown in _Dragon Ball GT_ when she flirted with two older men while Vegeta, her father, was driving. Bad day for those guys.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   Lucy, although it's usually overshadowed by other character traits, or just not plot-relevant. However, she does vocally admit to putting effort into being cute for this purpose, although her outfits also tend to be overshadowed by the more Stripperific outfits worn by... well, everyone. Other "clues" are also semi-frequently given, such as Erza's reaction to some of her underwear in a drawer.
        
        **Lucy:** Aww, come on. How much is it really worth? Surely you can cut me a deal. _\[later\]_ That trick usually works! So much for using my feminine wiles...
        
    -   Loke/Leo is a rare male example. Although he has shamelessly flirted with multiple girls, he gets a real kick out of playing Lucy. He uses quite a few one-liners around her and emotionally opens up to her on a personal level to get closer to her, but whenever she's about to get close he admits that he was just screwing with her.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_:
    -   Tsuruya in the novels really likes suggesting to do some intimate stuff with Kyon (and Mikuru). Kyon doesn't fall for it.
    -   In fact, Haruhi herself sometimes does it:
        
        "Swimsuits! Swimsuits! Everyone get dressed in your swimsuits and meet in the hall! Hee hee, I've helped choose these two cuties' swimsuits! You must be looking forward to them, right Kyon?" Haruhi revealed an expression of "I know what you've been thinking already" and smiled evilly, revealing her white teeth.
        
-   While there are many beautiful women in _High School D×D_, Akeno Himejima is the Queen of Tease. It doesn't help that she is _actively_ pursuing the Mistress role and is considered equal to Rias in terms of beauty. Bonus points for the teasing being much to Rias's chagrin, most of the time. ...Didn't we mention that Rias and Akeno are Heterosexual Life-Partners and both are in love with the protagonist Issei?
-   _Imaizumin-chi wa Douyara Gal no Tamariba ni Natteru Rashii: ~DEEP~_: Ruri likes to have romantic advances as a game with Imaizumi even if he's not entirely comfortable with it.
-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_: Iino is normally a repressive stick in the mud who balks at the very idea of anything sexual happening on the school campus, yet she begins to show a more wicked side of herself towards Shirogane once their Senpai/Kohai dynamic is in place despite not being attracted to him in the slightest. It does a good job in getting across the fact that she feels comfortable enough to fully let her guard down around him (something that she doesn't even do with her best friend Osaragi).
-   Tomoe from _Kamisama Kiss_ is another rare male example. He is Bishounen Little Bit Beastly Kitsune who is not wholly unaware of his attractiveness and can be quite pragmatic about employing both his looks and his charms when it suits him. To prove a point, he acts like this towards Nanami once. Oh, to add more fun to the mix, he is a Shapeshifting Seducer too.
-   Kazuma of _Kaze no Stigma_ for a rare straight male example. It's very clear how she feels but by the end of the show he's _still_ just teasing, even though he's inadvertently revealed that she's the closest living person to him now.
-   Aikuro Mikisugi of _Kill la Kill_, Ryuko's homeroom teacher and secret Sexy Mentor, loves nothing more than annoying her with suggestive comments, stripping, and a complete disregard for personal space.
-   In something of a cross between this trope and The Gadfly, Manabe from _Kotoura-san_ is a rare male example. He finds amusement (and even some arousal) in having sexual fantasies involving the title character, knowing that she can read his mind and that she embarrasses easily. In fact, to him, it's no fun to picture her in compromising situations like that _unless_ she can see and react to them.

-   _Lupin III_: Fujiko Mine is well aware of her sex appeal and will readily use her feminine wiles to get what she's after. But her policy is "look, but don't touch", so her clients and would-be suitors are usually left wanting after she's swindled them and run off with the goods. And her favorite fall guy happens to be Lupin III himself.
-   Sheryl Nome of _Macross Frontier_ shows no remorse about invoking this, even on occasion invoking it on another girl (such as teasing Nanase about her voluptuous figure). Her teasing ranges from subtle and innocent to sexy and blatant, and she's especially fond of invoking it on love interest Alto Saotome.

-   _Maria Watches Over Us_:
    -   Sei has this trope written all over her. Most of her obviously sexual teasing is directed at Yumi, though.
    -   Sachiko is also not above acting seductively toward Yumi, especially in the first and fourth anime seasons.
-   Kanade from _Mayo Chiki!_ is a big one towards Jiro. Particularly hilarious during the beach scene in episode 7 when she makes some really erotic noises and suggestive lines as he tries to nonchalantly put sunscreen on her, embarrassing him a lot in the process.
-   In chapter 60 of _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_, Ilulu admits that she sometimes submits herself to bouncing her breasts because she finds Taketo's reactions cute. The anime version of that scene instead has her talk about how she likes sleeping due to being set before his introduction, though there is an anime original segment later on where she smirks after catching him staring at her breasts.
-   The arachne (half woman and half spider) Rachnera from _Monster Musume_, even by this manga's standards. She pretty much starts putting the moves on Kimihito - albeit in a mocking fashion - even before she moves in. Once she does move in, she spends an entire day trying to get into his pants.
    -   Zombina also acts like this around Kimihito, as she flirts with him on a fake date and purposely tries to make him nervous by getting him to sew her breast back on. However, she secretly admits to her friends that her affection for him grew real.
-   _My Dress-Up Darling_: At first, Marin has absolutely no problem with letting Gojo measure her body while she's only wearing a bikini, or show him off some sexy lingerie she's trying (even suggesting she would try a sexier one if he asked her). As the story advances and she develops feelings for him, she starts getting more and more flustered around him, though she still does it as her way to show that she's genuinely attracted to him.
-   _My Hero Academia_ has the superheroine Mt. Lady, an Attention Whore who enjoys reveling in the Male Gaze, as shown in the very first episode:
    
    **Mt. Lady**: A pleasure to meet your ass-quaintance!
    
-   _Naruto_ has the title character's Sexy Jutsu, which appears to turn him into a naked woman. This results in a Nosebleed for any male who sees it. Well, except for Killer Bee, who No Sells the Harem Jutsu, Sexy Jutsu's upgraded version.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_:
    -   Evangeline orders her Robot Girl squad to strip Negi naked and throw him into the bath with her while she changes to her busty adult form, only for her to start phrasing things in the dirtiest way possible before licking the cut on his arm.
    -   To a lesser extent, a number of girls in the class make liberal use of Marshmallow Hell (especially Ayaka). Of course, Negi is ten, so none of the girls actually get anywhere.
    -   Many of Konoka's actions towards Setsuna look like flirting, such as the time she gives Setsuna a Finger-Suck Healing. It's ambiguous whether Konoka is doing it intentionally, but Chapter 252 heavily implies she isn't anywhere as innocent as she pretends to be. Konoka kisses Setsuna for a Pactio and makes it last way longer than it needs to. After that, the resident pervert Chamo asked if they wanted to just skip straight to a full pactio, commenting on their kiss being the longest yet.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: Asuka does this all the time to Shinji (when she's not angrily berating him for allegedly perving on her):
    -   One example is when Asuka demonstrates thermal expansion by cupping her hands over her breasts and asking him to calculate how much bigger they've become as a result. Shinji stammers that he doesn't know anything about all that.
    -   At episode 9 she pulls a curtain between them and calls it the "Wall of Jericho," ostensibly warning him not to come near her. At the moment it was not clear if she was intentionally dropping a hint (Bible-savvy viewers will remember that the Wall of Jericho is best known for _falling down_). During her utterly awful Mind Rape at the...wings? of Arael, it is made clear that she knew very very well what happened to the Wall of Jericho, and was hoping Shinji did too. Unfortunately he didn't.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Nami. Beyond her manipulations of Sanji, she also hits on a variety of shopkeepers to get discounts.
    -   In the Punk Hazard arc, Monet briefly talks about going on a date with Law when he returns to the lab.
    -   Wanda the dog Mink of the Mink tribe. After explaining that, far from despising humans, her kind mostly just see them as a variety of Monkey Minks with less hair, she also adds that there are those who wouldn't necessarily consider humans _un_attractive either... while licking Luffy's face again.
    -   In the Wano arc, Komurasaki/Kozuki Hiyori likes teasing with the people she's friends with or people she actually likes as opposed to her "marks" who are usually corrupt crooks she takes for all their worth. She especially likes poking fun as Zoro's flustered responses whenever she brings up how they shared a bed.
-   Panty of _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ plays this at least once in almost every episode. Way too much to count. Knowing her...
-   Ranma of _Ranma ½_ is a Gender Bender thanks to a fall in a Jusenkyō spring. While he desires nothing less than to be cured, he is still more than willing to use his female form's attractiveness to his advantage. Mostly, he uses this to charm guys into giving "her" free food or extra helpings, something a Big Eater always welcomes, but he also enjoys using it to mess with the ever-so-shy (and clueless) Ryōga Hibiki.
-   _Rebuild World_: There is a lot of overlap between this and The Gadfly with Akira's Virtual Sidekick Alpha, and his two fellow Private Military Contractors Sara and (to a lesser extent) Elena. Alpha being Invisible to Normals does this partially to try and manipulate Akira, and uses the excuse that she's trying to prepare him to resist a Honey Trap. Elena and Sara tease Akira but also their other friend Katsuya. Akira is frequently Not Distracted by the Sexy (especially if it's during a bath), having trauma induced Paralyzing Fear of Sexuality from his Dark and Troubled Past.
-   _Rune Soldier Louie_: Celecia is both a tease and a bit of a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing, where Louie's concerned. She's genuinely a very kindhearted person, but she isn't above using his feelings for her to her advantage; only to run off immediately after he's suited her purposes. Melissa and the others hang a massive lampshade on it at the end of the 9th episode (seen at 18:15-18:57, here).:
    
    **Melissa:** _\[Smirking\]_ Do you _still_ not get it, Louie? That girl was just pretending so she'd get on your good side. That way, she could have _you_ stop the machine.  
    **Jeanie:** _\[Irately at Louie\]_ You're just lucky we were all on the same team.  
    **Merrill:** _\[Smug grin\]_ Let's put it this way, Louie: elf girl used you. But as they say: "bitches will be bitches..."  
    _\[The girls laugh as Louie realizes he's an idiot.\]_
    
-   _Sailor Moon_: Sailor Neptune, Michiru, likes getting a rise out of people and flirting. She's also been shown to intentionally get her girlfriend Haruka jealous.
-   Chihaya of _Samurai Harem: Asu no Yoichi_ tease Yoichi this way. It doesn't seem she's ever been serious about taking it too far, just seeing how far she can push him before she gets stopped (by her elder sister when she goes full-out). She writes manga, so it's very clear what she's looking for.

-   Ikuto from _Shugo Chara!_ is a shameless tease and a rare male example. He has the ability to make even the most mundane things he says or does _drip_ with seduction and sexual undertones, and he loves to ruffle the heroine's feathers, sometimes pretending like he's flirting with her or about to kiss her, only to pull a "Just kidding!" right when she's good and flustered. No wonder their relationship is the way it is.
-   _Star Driver_'s Kanako Watanabe exists to make Takuto thoroughly uncomfortable with her increasingly suggestive comments.
-   _The Story Between a Dumb Prefect and a High School Girl with an Inappropriate Skirt Length_: Student Council President Yamato Nadeshiko enjoys teasing Vice President Kaoru Kogori, who's head-over-heels for her "gal version", but doesn't realize they're the same person.
-   Chizuru in _Student Council's Discretion_. Except it seems like if Ken actually tried anything he would probably burst into flames, melt, or get eaten by some invisible monster. Something bad, in any case. She's a little too scary, in any case.
-   Takagi of _Teasing Master Takagi-san_ combines this with The Gadfly and Loving Bully, causing no end of frustration, embarrassment and furious blushing for Nishikata.
-   Ryoko from _Tenchi Muyo!_ Of course she means her offers towards Tenchi, but she teases others.
-   _The Testament of Sister New Devil_:
    -   Mara's favorite hobby is trying to get a rise out of Basara, such as claiming to be wearing a Naked Apron in the first episode, only to then reveal her clothing underneath.
    -   Chisato takes it further. In one scene at her apartment, she has Basara stand behind her while she prepares dinner for him. Then tells him to wrap his arms around her waist and hold her tightly against him. Basara goes along with it but says it's improper, since she's his aunt and because she's underdressed.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Chisato asks if that's how he _really feels_. Before he can answer, she rubs her backside against his crotch and smirks upon feeling him get an erection, through his pants. Basara pouts that was unfair.
-   _To Love Ru_:
    -   Momo regularly sneaks into Rito's bed and in one notable instance pops up between his legs and offers to help him with his love problems. She even freely admits that she wants to be his mistress. And this before the sequel _Darkness_, where she no longer hides her lustful desire towards Rito!
    -   Risa is just as bad, but unlike Momo who only messes with Rito, Risa likes to tease everybody, male or female; she enjoys Skinship Grope a little _too_ much, once pushed Rito onto her bed and began stripping him, regularly feels up Yami-chan's legs and just generally acts as sultry as possible.
    -   Mea has a desire for Rito to lick her body and at times teases him by asking him to do it to her despite being in front of people.
-   Kureha from _Tokkô_ tends to be a tease. Saya also acts as a bit of a tease towards her own brother Ranmaru.
-   Ami from _Toradora!_ occasionally tries it with Ryuuji. It mostly seems to be a way for her to grab attention while keeping on top of the situation.
-   Jura from _Vandread_ likes to use this trope on Hibiki, especially whenever their mecha are merged together.
-   Urushibara does this a lot to Moroha in _World Break: Aria of Curse for a Holy Swordsman_. Though she usually only does it if Satsuki is present, as she seems to enjoy provoking the latter any time she gets too friendly with him.
-   Victor from _Yuri!!! on Ice_ constantly flirts with Yuri, invades his space, cuddles him, gets naked in front of him, and even jokes about them sleeping together or becoming lovers. Subverted later on when we find out that Victor was dead serious the entire time, and has been in love with Yuri since their Forgotten First Meeting.

    Comic Books 

-   _The DCU_:
    -   _Catwoman_ is well-known for using her sexuality as a weapon. The most obvious case is her flirting with Batman.
    -   _The Legend of Wonder Woman (2016)_: Etta will talk flirtatiously with most attractive men but claims and proves to be actually quite picky about who she'll even go out with on even a single date, requiring that they have a good heart as well as good looks.
-   _Marvel Universe_:
    -   _Spider-Man_: Black Cat always loves to get Peter flustered, whether or not they're actually dating at the moment. She notes that he gets so cute that she can't help herself. Mary Jane Watson does this too especially after Spider-Man defeats his enemies.
    -   Young Loki's life mission since some years seems to be to flirt with everybody in the Marvel universe, with no concern of gender or sexuality. They were already a troll and kind of Medium Aware — now they're also Otherworldly and Sexually Ambiguous and know how to invoke their stance as Mr. Fanservice.
-   Amy's "crush" in _Sonic the Comic_ is implied to just be her teasing Sonic because she likes to see him flustered, in contrast to all other continuities where she's a Smitten Preteen Girl.

    Fan Works 

-   _Cabin Fever: Parting Shot_: Marcy and Karen both become this after having a few too many drinks, and subsequently engaging in a saucy striptease in front of three of their male friends. Marcy relishes having three horny guys gawking at her naked body. Though Karen's thoughts aren't explicitly stated, she knows one of the guys is crazy about her, and she doesn't seem to have any reservations whatsoever about showing him what he's been missing out on.
    -   Implied to be Karen's established role in the aforementioned guy's life. He's loved her from afar for years and apparently she's been leading him on for pretty much the whole time, while simultaneously keeping him in friendzone limbo.
-   _Code Geass: Paladins of Voltron_: Would it be Milly if she wasn't this?
-   In _Dragonball Abridged_, Bulma is accused of being "a cocktease" by Krillin, who finds himself a bit... pent up after she spends the better part of a long spaceship trip in which they're cooped up together in her underwear, and he can't exactly "take care of it" because the only place with privacy on the ship is the bathroom, and Krillin can't do it there because the toilet keeps screaming at him in German.
-   Deconstructed in _The Flash Sentry Chronicles_. Like in canon, Rarity flirts and teases with Spike. However, she has also flirted and teased others as well, but they were adults who eventually caught on with what she was doing, while Spike is just a young dragon, and thus he didn’t know that she didn’t truly recuperate his feelings. It also caused Rarity to realize too late that she was Taking Advantage of Generosity with her teasing of Spike, which came to a head in the chapter "Spike’s Heartbreak", where Spike learned the hard way that Rarity was in a relationship with Lightning Blitz.
-   _Gunslinger Girl_ OC character Verotrois likes to tease the male employees of the Agency, annoying her fellow cyborgs whenever she does this with their handlers whom they usually have a crush on due to their conditioning.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ fanfic _Gankona, Unnachgiebig, Unità_: Let's just say Italy was one to both Germany and Japan when he Cosplayed as Sailor Moon.
    
    "Hey guys!" The sight that greeted the pair dropped two mouths into oblivion, their blood rushing south faster than the speed of light; impossibly short skirt which showcased voluptuous hips and crimson calf-high boots on legs that stretch on for miles, that cute little red bow on a white blouse that hugged all the right places and elegant gloves which encased lithe arms...it was a miracle upon the holiest upon holiest and merciful of miracles that the ship did not spontaneously detonate in a gory explosion of blood and guts at that very instant. Wink. Two-fingered salute. "Sailor Vene reporting for duty!"
    
-   _Ghosts of Evangelion_ deconstructs this. Misato flirts with Shinji because she enjoys a good joke. It never occurs to her that Shinji can think she is being serious or her behavior is hurting Asuka (who has a crush on Shinji):
    
    **Misato:** Believe me, Shinji, I'm not some—- some pedophile who's into younger guys. I just thought, "Maybe this will work," and gave it a shot. That's all it was. I promise, Shinji, you don't need to worry about that. You really don't.  
    **Shinji:** But you always teased me. All that sex stuff, and the skimpy clothes, and...  
    **Misato:** Oh, come on, Shinji, I was just teasing! Look, kid, there's only one man in my life, and you aren't him. Don't read too much into things that aren't meant to be taken seriously! I was just teasing you, that's all. I'll admit it went too far, and I'm sorry if it hurt you, but I'm telling you right now that I don't view you that way at all. It's important that you understand that.
    
-   _HERZ_: Kurumi spends the whole time teasing Shinji and trying to seduce him, much to his terror and Asuka’s wrath.
-   In _Incarnation of Legends_, Lusserina purposefully wears Stripperific clothing to tease others stealing looks at her, winking at Bell, and giving him a playful smirk when he catches him staring at her.
-   _The Many Dates of Danny Fenton_: Two Words: Felicia Hardy. Who is not shy on heavily flirting with Danny.
-   Neo in _Mending the Knots_ is very fond of using her illusions to tease Jaune, such as making him think she's naked when she's actually fully clothed.
-   _The Night Unfurls_ has a couple.
    -   Downplayed for Olga from the original version, who occasionally makes flirtatious remarks towards Kyril, but this merely overlaps with being The Gadfly, and she doesn't behave this way towards other people. Neither has she done anything drastic. His inevitable reaction would be to bluntly talk through her attempts to flirt.
    -   Shani is the mistress of the Rosie, so this behaviour is to be expected. She doesn't hesitate to Show Some Leg or walk in a suggestive way towards Kyril when the two meet. She even offers Kyril to relax, though he politely declined.
-   In a side story of _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, Misty shows some shades of this when she drags Ash to go on a swimsuit-shopping spree with her. Though in her case, it's partly because she's attracted to him. This later carries over to the main story, showing that Misty's behavior also rubbed off on Iris and Anabel, both of whom start being more open about their own interest in Ash.
-   _Quirk: Incubus_: Since flirting has sexual connotations, Ruki has taught Izuku to do it regularly as a socially acceptable means of stockpiling power with his quirk. Izuku often does this to Bakugo both for this reason and to get a rise out of him.
-   _The renegade hero!!!....Invader Zim?_: Jinmay loves to poke fun at Gaz by implying she has a crush on Zim, or otherwise acting provocative towards her regarding their own relationship.
-   _Son of the Sannin_:
    -   Mei Terumi loves using her good looks and charms to mess with people, _especially_ with Zabuza Momochi. The two eventually end up getting married.
    -   Fu shows some shades of this after the timeskip, nonchalantly asking Hinata if she and Naruto have already had sex with each other, while also hinting that she'd like to have it Shino (while she's staying at his home, no less).
-   _To Belong_: Sinbad accidentally flirts with Esmeralda right in front of her girlfriend, Jasmine. Sinbad doesn't know that Esmeralda's taken, but Esmeralda likes seeing Jasmine get jealous and worked up so she lets him flirt with her.
-   In _Unstable Equilibrium_, Asami liked to tease and flirt with Korra even before they were officially dating.
-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: Yang is very flirty all the time, and often jokingly says "it's a date!" whenever she plans an outing. She's rather flabbergasted when Jaune takes those jokes seriously and treats them as real dates, complete with hand-holding and flowers. Since she's a Tomboy, she's never had anyone treat her in a real romantic manner, and has no idea what to do with herself.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_, Mai Valentine does this, especially just to see Joey squirm.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Sugarpuss in _Ball of Fire_ seems to enjoy flirting with the shy English professor Bertram while she waits to elope with her fugitive boyfriend. At first, she tries to Show Some Leg to convince him to live in the mansion he shares with his colleagues and then continues to use this tactic to make him allow her to stay longer. She demonstrates what the phrase "yum yum" means and smooches him a couple of times, and re-enacts the first time he became attracted to her. It works like a charm, however, it worked a little too much because the next day, Bertram proposes to her.
-   _Best in Show_: Scott Donlan doesn't hesitate to ogle or flirt with anyone who catches his eye, despite already being in a relationship.
-   _The Eiger Sanction_:
    -   Women hitting on Hemlock usually make a point of crossing their legs in his eyeshot.
    -   When Hemlock balks at climbing further, George takes off her top (and she's not wearing a bra) to give him incentive to keep climbing, but by the time he gets up there she's vanished, much to his annoyance.
-   The parody of Mystique in _Epic Movie_ is certainly this. She originally found Peter unappealing for being a loser, since he was considered an outcast due to his lame power of "Chicken Wings". However, after finding out that he was gonna be the King of Gnarnia, she suddenly found him incredibly attractive. The night before the final battle, she walked over to him rather sexily, teasing him and eventually seducing him into having sex with her. She continued to tease him in bed by transforming into his desires using her shapeshifter powers.
-   In _A Foreign Affair_, Marlene Dietrich is the epitome of this trope to the MPs that plan to take her to HQ and question her. But she has a convincing way to seduce them.
-   _G-Force_: Juarez to Darwin and Blaster. When Darwin complains about her keeping them in confusion and desperation, she replies that is exactly how she likes it.
-   Nellie in _The Half-Breed_ strings along several men — dating Sheriff Dunn, canoodling eponymous half-Native American Lo and meeting him in the forest for trysts, dating local businessman Jack Brice. In the end, she tells Jack that he's the only man she ever loved.
-   A relatively uncommon male example of this with Father Leon, the Sexy Priest in _Léon Morin, Priest_. He is clearly tempting all the sexy, horny women in the village with the promises of erotic delights that he has no intention of delivering because he's a priest. He even goes so far as to brush the cheek of poor frustrated Barny, his main target, with the sleeve of his cassock during a church service. What's unclear is if Leon teases Barny and all the other lonely women as a means of roping them in to the Catholic Church, or whether he does it For the Evulz.
-   _Liz In September_: Coqui openly flirts with Liz early on, and tries to seduce her although she's got a girlfriend. Liz nearly gives in, but a call stops them.
-   _The Story of Temple Drake_: How Temple gets her rocks off, by luring all the bachelors in town to spend time and money on her, and letting them feel her up, but never actually having sex with them. One annoyed suitor says "You always do that. Fire a man up and then poof, put him out." Someone else writes on a bathroom wall, "Temple Drake is just a fake/She wants to have and eat her cake."
-   _A Woman's Testament_: Kimiko does this for a living. She's a bar girl who wears provocative clothing, cuddles up to men, strings them along, gets them to fork over some money in expectation of sex...and then she doesn't provide the sex, usually resorting to an I Have to Iron My Dog excuse. She has taken up with many men, but she says that she's only had to have sex with them twice, because every other time she's been able to get out of it (after getting the money).
-   _Young & Wild_: Antonia says Daniela is an "Evangelitease" for flirting with her and then running off. The two have sex after this.

    Literature 

-   The very first sentence of _The Little House_ reads "Mélite took to the company of men with great ease, and only kindly souls and the best of friends did not consider her a flirt." <sup>In the original French,&nbsp;</sup>  And certainly, Mélite enjoys the power she holds over the Marquis Trémicour when she is allowed to dictate the pacing of the tour of his private residence, and especially when she can frustrate his clumsy, amorous advances. But the narration goes out of its way to clarify that her intentions are innocently coquettish, never malicious.

-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   Margaery Tyrell. Despite Cersei's best attempts to get her to commit adultery so she can be discredited, it seems that Margaery flirts but is too clever to let it go any further.
    -   Seems to be a Tyrell family trait: Margaery's brother, Loras "The Knight of Flowers" Tyrell, regularly puts on a show of distributing white roses to his female fans during tournaments before singling out one to give a red rose to, all designed to pump up his reputation as a knight and, incidentally, obfuscate the fact that he's _very_ gay in a very much non-gay-friendly setting.
    -   In _The Sworn Sword_, Lady Rohanne has a single plait that she plays with coquettishly whenever she's flirting with Dunk. When it's time to leave her, he cuts it off as a souvenir.
-   _Spice and Wolf_:
    -   Holo loves to tease her partner Lawrence by flirting with him about their relationship.
    -   Lawrence seems to be well able to give back all that he gets in this department. Despite her centuries more experience, he seems to do better in the long run with this trope. Lawrence ups his game in the second arch; at that point, he was almost matching her blow for blow and actually won once.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Renegade Slayer Faith does a Grand Theft Me on Buffy and encounters vampire Spike while dancing at the Bronze. She proceeds to explain in lurid detail exactly what a hot chick with Super-Strength could do to him if she wished, but then smirks and says, "But it would be wrong." Spike is needless to say furious, but thanks to his inhibitor chip can't do anything about her taunting. At least, not that season.
    -   When Spike first gets his Restraining Bolt, preventing him from biting humans, Buffy taunts him with her uncovered neck.
        
        **Buffy:** Oh, look at my poor neck. All _bare_ and _tender_ and _exposed_. All that blood just _pum-ping_ away.  
        **Spike:** Giles, make her stop!
        
    -   Played for Drama in "When She Was Bad". Suffering a Heroic BSoD after her first Not Quite Dead moment, Buffy lapses into Alpha Bitch behavior, doing a Mating Dance with Xander at the Bronze, then after raising a hint of Rescue Sex, walking out on him.
-   Kate Beckett in _Castle (2009)_ loves to drive Chivalrous Pervert Rick Castle up the wall with her comments and her flirting. It's even lampshaded in one episode:
    
    **Castle:** You should really moonlight \[as a dominatrix\]. Trust me — you would make a _fortune_. Come on, isn't there anything you would like to do with your handcuffs besides arresting criminals?  
    **Beckett:** No... _\[seductively\]_ but there is one hot, wild, _kinky_ thing that I do like doing...  
    _\[Castle's elbow slips off the table as he stares at her earnestly\]_  
    **Beckett:** _\[flatly\]_ Putting killers behind bars.  
    **Castle:** _\[disappointed\]_ See, you're already a tease — you're halfway there.
    
    -   Deconstructed in the fourth season when, owing to a chain of misunderstandings and secrets, Castle eventually comes to believe that it really _is_ all just a joke to her — and, since he's fallen deeply in love with her by this point, does not take it well. Which causes a bigger mess when he starts lashing out, much to Beckett's hurt and confusion since she actually _is_ in love with him as well.
-   Played for laughs on _Criminal Minds_, in which the not-involved Morgan and Garcia mutually tease each other. Their sexy phone banter is seen usually once an episode, and while their team no longer even notices their outrageous flirtations, it tends to send others for a loop.

-   Kid-friendly example in _iCarly_. Carly mentions that she's making piña colada lip gloss. When Freddie asks if it actually tastes like it, she asks him if he wants to find out. He eagerly agrees. She leans in... only for her to rub some of it on her hand and smoosh it against his lips.
-   Selina Kyle from _Gotham_ is a teenage example. She frequently flirts with Bruce Wayne and even steals a few kisses off of him just to make him shy.
-   Ziva in _NCIS_ frequently sends Tony's blood pressure ridiculously high on purpose.
-   Alexis Rose on _Schitt's Creek_ loves to telegraph her sexual availability regardless of her relationship status: "I'm a little bit single, even when I'm not!" She flirts shamelessly with Mutt in Season 1, and she also gets ready to tease a hot young man on a motorcycle, only to discover it is Ted, her former fiancé whom she dumped for being too nice. She also flirts with an amused but uninterested Patrick, which leads her to conclude correctly that the young businessman is interested in her brother. Eventually, in order to win Ted back, Alexis must become a better person rather than rely on her usual flirty techniques.
-   _The Shannara Chronicles_: Eretria constantly flirts with Wil and Amberle during Season 1, while also denying she's attracted to them.
-   _Stargate SG-1_: Daniel assumes Vala is this. He's wrong, as she has real feelings for him, but she certainly teases other male cast members with no intention of putting out.
-   In _Two and a Half Men_, naive Jake asks a girl what her lip gloss tastes like and when she asks if he wants to find out he says "sure". She leans in for a kiss, but Jake scrapes his finger over her lips then put it in his mouth.
-   Cat in _Victorious_ is completely good-natured, but shown to be quite flirtatious.

    Music 

-   "I Know What Boys Like" by The Waitresses features a woman bragging in a Deadpan Snarker tone about how much of a tease she is.
    
    I got my cat moves that so upset them
    
    Zippers and buttons, fun to frustrate them
    
    They get so angry, like pouty children
    
    Denied their candy, I laugh right at them
    

-   From "When You're Alone (It Ain't Easy) by Journey:
    
    "She told me she'd be there, She phoned me today. Little girl, big teaser, So I'm on my way."
    

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Alissa Flash's gimmick (besides Sensational Sherri eye paint) used to be that she would wear a jacket that exposed a sports bra, and then zip it up so no one could see it. Can you imagine that the fans in the Impact Zone booed her for this?
-   This became The Beautiful People's gimmick, following their reunion in TNA, which began with Angelina Love and Velvet Sky promising to strip, only to admit they lied. Love and Velvet have even leaned in almost mouth to mouth during their entrances, only to pull away when the camera zooms in and give nothing but a mocking finger wag.
-   Molly Holly, in a very Leaning on the Fourth Wall way. Her _WWE Divas Undressed_ shoot included her showing cleavage in a pajama top with most of the buttons unbuttoned except for the one that would actually have shown her breasts if she unbuttoned it, clearly aware that viewers would want her to unbutton that button and that she wouldn't do it.

    Video Games 

-   In _Bayonetta_, the titular Hot Witch will invoke this trope during _most_ of her screen time. Notable examples include: straddling/fake kissing Luka, letting several angels strip her naked before donning her usual Spy Catsuit made of Magic Hair in the second game's opening (complete with inappropriate moaning), slowly dancing with a stripper pole during the credits and dressing like a Naughty Nun at her own fake funeral.
-   Morrigan from _Darkstalkers_ is a succubus who likes to taunt Demetri with her charms, knowing that he is smitten with her... at times.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   Isabela teases just about everyone during party banter in the second game, especially Carver and Aveline.
    -   Morrigan is a milder version in the first game; she limits her teasing to the Warden, Sten, and Alistair but certainly does tease those three quite a bit.
    -   Zevran is like this with everyone except the player character (whom he will happily have sex with). In particular, he enjoys teasing Morrigan, Leliana, Wynne and Alistair. On a couple of occasions, Oghren too. Most of it seems to be for trollish reasons.
    -   _Dragon Age: Origins – Awakening_ comically reveals _Oghren_ to be this; Sigrun finally responds to his drunken come-ons and he doesn't take her up on it, and she crows that he's all talk.
-   _Fallout 4_: K-LEO, the sultry, seductive owner of Goodneighbor's weapons store. She's also an _Assaultron._ Interestingly, she accuses you of being this trope if you decide not to buy any of her wares.
-   _Galaxy Angel_:
    -   Forte Stollen sometimes shows shades of this, putting on a seductive voice to tease Tact. On the sequel trilogy she also teases her protegé Kazuya on occasion.
    -   In _Galaxy Angel II_, Tequila is the only one among the Rune Angels who actively flirts with Kazuya for fun. Her teasing grows more substantial if she's romanced. Kahlua does this too, since it's slightly easier for her as the oldest member of the group, but Tequila definitely does it more often.
-   Kaeya from _Genshin Impact_ seems to be interested in the player character romantically, and outside of serious moments, most of his dialogue consists of flirtations and asking the player out on dates. Some dialogue options allow you to tease him back, though not as much as he does.
-   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III and IV_ has Musse Egret constantly teasing that she wants to get together with Rean, her teacher. She cements her interest in Rean in _IV_ by catching him off-guard and kissing him at the beach with just the two of them while wearing swimsuits. Whether Rean reciprocates or not however depends depends on the player.
-   Kyrie from _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's Portable: The Gears of Destiny_, who hits on both Fate _and_ Chrono during her matches against them.
-   In _Megadimension Neptunia VII_, Neptune, as Purple Heart of all people, manages to be this towards one of the villains of the game.
-   Sylvia Christel from _No More Heroes_, almost sadistically so. Of course, the person she's teasing is Travis, a bit of an easy target and she easily becomes his Lust Object, convincing him to go along with the fights by promising to sleep with him when he reaches 1st place (she doesn't). In _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_ she acts much the same way, even trying to tempt him _again_ with the promise to sleep with him if he gets to 1st place. He refuses it at first, but she begins to brag about how she's a Sex Goddess and a Yoga Master and he's interested again.
-   Sayoko Uehara, the character for _Persona 4_'s Devil Social Link, makes her introduction by hitting on the protagonist, and does it some more for the next 3 or so levels of the S-Link. Then she stops being playful as we see another side of her...
-   Falls-From-Grace of _Planescape: Torment_. She's a succubus, after all, even though she's a lapsed one, and she's not above joking about it.
    -   For instance, attempting to unequip her bodice:
        
        _"We don't know each other well enough yet."_  
        _"I'm afraid if you were to remove that... I would be naked."_
        
    -   And equipping a ring:
        
        _"Oh! Does this mean we are engaged?"_  
        _"A ring? Without a proposal? How improper!"_
        
-   In _Potion Permit_, Helene is well-aware of her feminine charm, which she uses to flirt with you and Dean.
-   From _Quest for Glory III_, the Welcome Woman, Janna Jamir. The player can flirt with her, but nothing ever comes of it (though it's a good and quick way to build your Communication score), and it should also be pointed out that _she's married_. Not that it stops her from often being the instigator of the exchanges. Additionally, she'll strike a sexy pose (well, by the standards of 256-color VGA graphics c.1992) when she goes to get your meal if you choose to flirt.
    
    **Janna:** It is not just the room you warm with your sunshine, oh prince of passion. Your words inflame my cheeks and other places.
    
-   Ada Wong from _Resident Evil_ is a professional Femme Fatale who playfully flirts with Leon Kennedy while fighting against him and using him for her own secret agenda. She usually leaves him every time after manipulating him. However, she eventually develops real feeling for him, but her seductive behavior doesn't cease.
-   Leon in _Rune Factory 4._ Even if you _don't_ pursue his Romance Sidequest, he still relentlessly teases the player with various flirtations. He also constantly teases Forte, much to her chagrin.
-   Keiji from _Sengoku Basara_ is a male version, though he doesn't use his own charms. Rather, all he needs to do to make his favourite victim and resident Chaste Hero Yukimura blush is mention that he should find someone to love.
-   _Shining Resonance_: Rinna is a habitual flirt and a troll, which makes her the most forward of all the girls in Yuma's harem. She'll usually toy with him long enough to get a reaction, before letting him know she's joking. But it can be subverted if the player chooses to have Yuma woo her. In which case, all her teasing turns out to be genuine attempts to gain his affections.
-   _Silver Falls Gaiden: Deathly Delusion Destroyers And Ruby River_ has Mimmet, who came to the camp in search of Bull Brandish, hoping to catch him in a state of undress after swimming. When she realizes that he isn't there, she tries flirting with Gus, which fails due to him desperately searching for his missing husband. Minutes later, she tries flirting with Bass, only to be shot down immediately due to his depression over his failed marriage.
-   Rouge the Bat from _Sonic the Hedgehog_. She sarcastically flirts with Knuckles, Shadow, Sonic, Tails, Eggman... (Though the first two could also be not so sarcastic.)
-   _Super Robot Wars: Original Generation_: Excellen Browning. What? Teasing your fellow pilots to see you in Bunny Suits doesn't count? Or walking around in nothing but a towel. Or mercilessly hitting on the guys she knows are either shy or easily flustered around women. She leaves it at that except in the case of her Single-Target Sexuality. She typically claims to be straight but states she would make an exception for certain women.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   Played for Laughs with Anise from _Tales of the Abyss_. Anise _thinks_ she can be this and she tries, but due to being 13 and looking about 10, she fails hilariously, most notably in one skit appropriately titled "Operation Sexy Anise... Failed?!", in which Anise wears her bathing suit to distract/stun monsters with her "sexiness" and thus leave them open for attack. Luke and Guy tease her by saying the monsters seemed drawn to her and ask her to wear it again for the next battle.
    -   Judith from _Tales of Vesperia_ loves making Raven faint.
        
        **Judith:** I wonder if I should show a little more, you know...?  
        **Raven:** Oh, yes! OH _GOD, YES!_
        
    -   In _Tales of Xillia 2_, Muzet acts like this to the guys. All of her unique victory quotes with them involve teasing, and she really loves doing it to Ludger and Jude in cutscenes/skits. With the exception of 'tethering' with Jude and Gaius, she doesn't ever take it further. If Ludger maxes her affinity, her victory quote will change from teasing to one where she _apologises_ for teasing him all the time.
    -   Zaveid from _Tales of Zestiria_ will flirt with every female member of the party, but it doesn't appear to be serious at all. He even says a flirtatious line to a female comrade if he's casting a _healing spell_ on her.
-   Karura in _Utawarerumono_ does this a lot. Although she's generally joking or simply, well, teasing, it's pretty clear she would like to be taken up on her offers.
-   _A Very Long Rope to the Top of the Sky_: Svetlana towards Gainer, since he's unattached, and she's blatantly displaying her body:
    
    **Svetlana:** Why, Gainer, did you come all this way to see me?  
    **Gainer:** Uh...  
    **Svetlana:** Whoops, looks like I accidentally dropped my knife. How careless of me! Let me slowly bend over and pick it up.  
    **Gainer:** ...
    

    Visual Novels 

-   _Fate/stay night_:
    -   Rin Tohsaka admits that she finds Shirou's reactions to her teasing/tormenting hilarious. He gets extremely embarrassed and shy just being alone with or near her or even just seeing her in _non-school clothing_. On the other hand, she herself gets rather flustered by how straightforwardly honest he is. Although she is something of a love interest, she's not flirting, just enjoying his awkwardness.
    -   This gets turned on its head in the _Unlimited Blade Works_ route, where she and Shirou actually do hook up. Shirou eventually starts getting her back by taking her jokes at face value, which in turn causes _her_ to get all embarrassed and flustered.
-   Hiroki in _Canvas 2_ enjoys flirting with his students. Contrary to what you might expect, he never gets in trouble for it.
-   Sakazaki Yuuya of _Hatoful Boyfriend_ shows signs of this. He's a massive tease but his flirtations seem to be more for fun than serious — he's actually too busy to "take you somewhere nice" or just about anything else.
-   Shion Sonozaki in _Higurashi: When They Cry_ likes to hit on Keiichi to make her twin sister Mion (who has a crush on him) jealous, by doing such things as squeezing his arm between her breasts. She doesn't have any real feelings for him though, because she's only interested in Satoshi or at least that was the case at first. In Meakashi-hen, she admits she's started to fall for Keiichi later on because as she puts it, both twins always had the same tastes, as Mion admits that she liked Satoshi too. Compare with Mion, her gadfly sister.
-   Kurugaya from _Little Busters!_ loves to tease Riki by doing things like casually asking him to take a bath with her or sending him a photo of a striped piece of paper and telling him it's of her panties because she finds it adorable how flustered he invariably gets. It takes him a while to realise that, while she's very adept at dishing it out, she isn't at all used to getting it back, and when he starts teasing her a little after they start going out she gets every bit as flustered as he does.

    Webcomics 

-   _El Goonish Shive_ has two. One insists on shapeshifting into _attractive_ females, and the other combines it with being Innocent Fanservice Girl through having Single-Target Sexuality.
-   Akila, resident Nature Spirit and Ms. Fanservice of _The Noordegraaf Files_. Due to her being a literal nymph, she's able to catch the gaze of quite a few characters - and she milks it for all she can get.
-   _Oglaf_: Mistertique, a.k.a. The Clit Tease is a rare heterosexual male example. His whole schtick involves seducing women, then leaving before actually doing the deed. Since, y'know, that would ruin the **Masculine Mystique**. (Not that this makes him less desirable in-universe.)
    -   In one storyline, a "tease and denial expert" is shown responding to a summons for breaking a... rather particular curse:
        
        Make this man come without touching his cock
        
-   In the fan comic _Roommates_ we have Mr. King (aka the Erlkönig), who is a heterosexual male and to quote the fans a "bloody flirt" to several female characters (seems to try this with any woman who doesn't know him well enough).
-   _Boyfriends._: Nerd is a much bigger tease than his cutesey demeanor would suggest and he has quite a lot of fun getting a rise out of his boyfriends with his shenanigans.

    Web Animation 

-   Deconstructed in the _Manga Women's Eden_ episode _The tragic fate of a woman who wanted to be treated like a princess forever_: When Himeko found out her charms didn't work on Yuki-san, she tried to flirt harder to steal him from her superior Choko-san. Moreover, she didn't stop trying to flirt with Yuki-san _even on his wedding day_, causing her superiors to find out and order her to take a break before demoting her to a smaller branch.

    Web Original 

-   _Critical Role_: Vex'ahlia's general demeanor. She's very fond of calling people "dear" and "darling", especially while trying to charm them into giving her stuff/doing her favors, accompanied with a trademark flirtatious wink.
    -   Jester continues this in the second campaign, being the most flirtatious member of the Mighty Nein, particularly around Fjord, but also with Beau and Caleb on occasion. It is for an entirely differnet reason than Vex, as Jester grew up in an environment where all conversation was flirty and sexualized, which really shaped the way in which she herself socializes with others.
-   Doug Walker tends to act like this for fun and fanservice, even including jokingly flirting with his brother.
-   Ashe Gogus in _Ilivais X_ certainly is this. Her comments are never overtly sexual, but she's extremely flaunty and every other sentence she spouts has something to do with boobs.
-   Sarah does this to Danielbeast a bit in _lonelygirl15_ series 1. Then she tells him to back off when she decides he's taking it too seriously.
-   Dr. Tease from The Nostalgia Chick's show flirts with everybody just for fun. Her full name is basically a pun for "cocktease" ("Doctor Coquette Tease").
-   Gay male example: Jeremy acts like this toward Simon in _Shadow of the Templar_ even after they get into a sexual relationship, mainly because it flusters/irritates Simon and possibly also because it's the easiest way for him to express his deeper feelings for him.
-   _Whateley Universe_: In "Boston Brawl", Nikki and Billie delight in tormenting Hank by exaggeratedly flirting with him and draping themselves over him.

    Western Animation 

-   _Batman: The Animated Series_: Catwoman maintains the flirtatious nature of her comic book counterpart by coming onto the dark knight himself in every episode featuring her. She and Batman always have a romantic moment in their encounters, but she'll usually leave him by the end. It sadly ends with their relationship going nowhere, with her abandoning him after he saves her yet again.
    -   Poison Ivy loves cozying up to Batman while trying to kill him. In her debut episode "Pretty Poison" she practically treats their encounter like a date, coyly slinking out from behind a tree, sensually rubbing his shoulders, even giving him what's effectively a goodnight kiss. And, based on her passionate moaning while they locked lips, Ivy honestly enjoyed doing it. Too bad he had to kick her in the face, ruining their "late night rendezvous."
-   _Family Guy_: In an off-hand joke, Lois describes all women as this when she Experimented in College. It's the reason why she went back to men.
-   _Justice League Unlimited_, "Task Force X": After Colonel Flag introduces Lawton to Sans Souci as the explosives expert, she immediately begins coming onto him and flirts with him throughout the entire episode.
    
    **Lawton:** I know, I've seen the pictures.  
    **Sans Souci:** _\[smiling\]_ And that's all you're gonna get to see, killer.
    
-   _Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart_: A subtle example with Tanya Keys, who consistently trolls Mao Mao with her pranks, pet names and sultry voice.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Child-friendly example, Rarity constantly utilizes her charms and good looks to get her way.
-   All of Red Hot Riding Hood's musical numbers have her dancing as provocatively as possible usually wearing a Sexy Backless Outfit and singing songs about wanting arms wrapped around her.
-   In _The Venture Brothers_, Molotov Cocktease is the target of constant Belligerent Sexual Tension with Brock, but it can never be resolved, due in part to her chastity belt.
