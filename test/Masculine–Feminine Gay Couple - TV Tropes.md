_"Americans are more accepting of gays when they're in a clear-cut gender role relationship. Like Ellen and Portia."_

When it comes to gay couples in media, this is the most common setup for them. Whichever gender they are, one is very feminine while the other is very masculine.

For gay male pairings, this means a Manly Gay or Straight Gay character and a Camp Gay or Macho Camp one. For lesbian pairings, a Butch Lesbian and a Lipstick Lesbian. This usually also shows itself in their character designs, with one being shorter and daintier (sometimes even twinky if male) than their One Head Taller, and often more muscular, lover.

This trope goes back to the idea that there must be a "man" and a "woman" in a same-sex relationship, and often invokes Opposites Attract. Because this trope is often based on this misconception, it's less common in works written by actual queer people. In real life, at least where queer men are concerned, a Camp Gay man and a Manly Gay man are unlikely to be each other's type, and any exceptions would be noteworthy _because_ they're exceptions (such as a Chubby Chaser and The Bear). With lesbians it's not as cut and dry, but not all queer women are pure butch or fem, and many resent being pigeonholed into such categories. However, fiction only cares about averting this trope when it means pairing together two Manly Gays or Lipstick Lesbians for fanservice reasons. Two Butch Lesbians or Camp Gays in a relationship are all but unheard of where the media is concerned.

For more platonic versions see Tomboy and Girly Girl and Sensitive Guy and Manly Man. Also, see Uke and Seme for Japanese tropes heavily associated with this concept. See also Gay Guy Seeks Popular Jock, where the gay guy is generally less conventionally masculine than the popular athlete. Depending on what sort of story we're watching, there may be a wedding with a Gay Groom in a White Tux. See also Lover and Beloved, which focuses on age difference, but usually has the older partner (the Lover) as being more masculine while the younger partner (the Beloved) is usually more feminine.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Akuma no Riddle_, Tokaku and Haru become a couple at the end of the manga. Tokaku is a stoic Bifauxnen and assassin, while Haru is a sweet Girlish Pigtails\-wearing Pollyanna.
-   Ymir from _Attack on Titan_ is a tall, muscular young woman who usually wears trousers and is The Lad-ette. Ymir's in love with the shorter and more feminine Krista.
-   A Hide Your Lesbians variation occurs in _Canaan_ with Canaan and Maria. They never make the full leap to romance but their relationship is heavy on the subtext. They're also a Starcrossed Lovers example, with Canaan's life as an Action Girl not meshing well with Maria's civilian life.
-   _Citrus_: Mei has a more masculine personality (aggressive, dominant, emotionally cold) while Yuzu is much more feminine (energetic, fashion-obsessed, stereotypically girly).
-   Played with in _Gunbured × Sisters_. Maria, a dhampir who grew up fighting to survive on the streets, seems at first glance like a Butch Lesbian, with a short fuse, foul mouth, and more boyish taste in clothing, not to mention being much more of a physical fighter than Dorothy. Dorothy, a nun who is seemingly the Lipstick Lesbian of the two and passes herself off as a proper lady and prefers long gowns, is actually the more dominant and sexually rapacious partner between them (Maria is a Reluctant Fanservice Girl at best).
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_: Chibitalia and Holy Roman Empire are a Puppy Love example. Chibitalia is a meek artist who wore female clothes while HRE is a bold warrior who wears boy's clothes. Played with as HRE actually mistook Chibitalia for a girl. As an adult, Italy became a keet and started wearing men's attire.
-   _The Island of Giant Insects_: Lesbian Jock Matsuoka and Lipstick Lesbian Mami.
-   In _Kase-san_, Yamada is a sweet, shy girl who loves flowers, while her girlfriend Kase is an outgoing athlete with Boyish Short Hair.
-   _Lonely Wolf, Lonely Sheep_ is about two women named Kakimoto Imari who fall in love and bond. Big Imari is tall and tomboyish while Little Imari is petite and girly.
-   _Love Gene XX_: Enforced by law in-universe. Women are split into two demographics: Adams, who take traditionally masculine roles such as breadwinning or fighting, and Eves, who take traditionally feminine roles such as homemaking and bearing children. It's shown multiple times in-story that when a pair of Adams tries to get together, the law states one of them has to become an Eve for it to go through.
-   Suzu from _Love Me For Who I Am_ is a Long-Haired Pretty Boy who likes crossdressing. He has a more boyish-looking and overprotective boyfriend named Haruto.
-   _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid:_ Kobayashi is sufficiently androgynous to the point that she is often mistaken for a man, while Tohru has a large bust and wears conventionally feminine clothes. Kobayashi goes to work, Tohru stays home and keeps house.
-   _My-Otome_ and to a far lesser degree _My-HiME_ have Natsuki and Shizuru. Natsuki is a Badass Biker Action Girl while Shizuru is Ojou Lady of War. In _My Hime_ they only have Ship Tease which after a lot of trouble from Shizuru turns into a Relationship Upgrade at the end, but _My Otome_ has the two clearly as a couple.
-   Konoka and Setsuna from _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_. Konoka is a very girly and cheery Ojou with healing powers while Setsuna is a serious swordswoman with some Bifauxnen looks who is determined to protect Konoka from anything. This aspect of their relationship is emphasized on some occasions when they dress up and Setsuna ends up wearing male clothing to contrast Konoka's elegant dresses.
-   _Revolutionary Girl Utena_ has the butch Utena and femme Anthy, who are also Lady and Knight. Both are bisexual as well. This is pronounced even more in The Movie as Utena crops her hair short and turns into a bifauxnen while Anthy grows her hair.
-   Flum and Milkit from _Roll Over and Die_. Flum takes on the profession of Adventurer, which effectively make her the breadwinner of their relationship, on top of being a Short Tank and an Action Girl, Flum is obviously the masculine side. Meanwhile Milkit takes on the role of the housewife in all but name.
-   Haruka and Michiru from _Sailor Moon_ are one of the most iconic examples in manga. Haruka is a cool bifauxnen who always wears the boy's school uniform and Michiru is her Ojou girlfriend who plays the violin. This is somewhat an example of Character Exaggeration in the '90s anime. In the manga, Haruka is still butch but has her feminine moments and even occasionally wears girly clothes. In the '90s anime, she is much more masculine and is even a Bokukko (in the manga she uses the girly pronoun "atashi"). In the manga, Haruka actively disguises herself as male while in the 1990s anime, she's a tomboy who just gets mistaken for male.
-   Subverted in _Sweet Blue Flowers_. Yasuko is Fumi's first girlfriend. She's a tall, boyish-looking girl who prefers masculine clothes outside of school and is the captain of the basketball team. Yasuko, however, doesn't enjoy being forced into a masculine role in order to fit people's expectations and is actually bisexual, not lesbian. Yasuko and Fumi break up, and after being Put on the Bus Yasuko grows her hair out and undergoes a Girliness Upgrade. Fumi's girlfriend at the end of the manga is her short, girly childhood friend Akira.
-   Tetsuo and Taichi from _Yuureitou_ become this in the epilogue. Tetsuo is a cool-headed Byronic Hero transgender guy and Taichi is a sensitive Lovable Coward Distressed Dude that Tetsuo meets. The two start out with an Odd Friendship that quickly ends up romantic. This aspect of their relationship is emphasized when Taichi is forced to be Disguised in Drag and pretends to be Tetsuo's wife. He initially loathes it but soon finds it comfortable and notes that he wouldn't mind being Tetsuo's cross-dressing lover.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batwoman_ comics contain several variations:
    -   Downplayed with Kate Kane and Sophie Moore. Kate was more masculine in appearance than Sophie, but both were skilled Army cadets.
    -   Played straight when the earlier relationship between Kate and Renee Montoya is depicted in flashbacks, with Renee being definitely butch. This evens out and becomes downplayed when they reconnect years later, with Kate being more butch than previously.
    -   Subverted with Kate and Maggie Sawyer. At first glance they fit the archetype, with Kate being femme and Maggie being butch, however, they are both in fact butch. The versions of the characters in _DC Comics Bombshells_ are both femmes.

Rikki is a short-haired tomboy and her outfit's far more utilitarian, akin to a Wrench Wench getup.
-   _The Girl from the Sea_: Morgan is short-haired and slightly tomboyish. Kelpie has long hair and more of a feminine look while in human form. It's not that big of a contrast though, making it downplayed.

-   On-off lovers and central characters Maggie (femme) and Hopey (butch) in _Love and Rockets_. Maggie was feminine even in her most punk period during her youth, while Hopey went back and forth as a young woman but got very butch when she was older.
-   _The Sandman (1989)_: Subverted with lesbian couple Hazel and Foxglove who are both butch, then played straight as Hazel starts dressing in a more conventionally feminine way after she gets pregnant.
-   _Shortcomings_: Sasha is rather feminine and she describes an ex-girlfriend of hers who looked like a handsome young man. Ben questions why a woman who likes women would date someone boyish since to him it seems like it defeats the purpose.
-   _Tim Drake: Robin_: Tim's neighboring boat in the marina is the home of Tammy and Lauren, a lesbian couple with one muscular butch partner and one dress wearing femme partner.

    Fan Works 

-   _Another Day in Bluffington Duology_: Patti and Beebe play with this trope.

Being a god of Pride, Stoltur is vain, bold, and assertive, while Caerulus, a god of Humility, is more empathetic, sensitive, and merciful. However, while Stoltur is the dominant partner, he has been helping Caerulus build his self-esteem by taking turns in being dominant/submissive during sex and encouraging him to take lead in general. This is extremely beneficial for Caerulus, who went through a particularly bad Trauma Conga Line that all but destroyed his sense of self-worth by the time he got out of it.

-   In the _Plan B_ fanfic _Interpretive Steps for a New Tango_, neither Bruno nor Pablo is particularly feminine but the heteronormative Argentinian culture they grew up in causes them to assume that they have to conform to masculine/feminine roles if they try out things like dancing, and Pablo's fear that he's being forced to play the submissive "woman" role to Bruno causes him to temporarily break up with him until he realizes that they don't need to follow this trope to be happy together.

-   _Batwoman (2019)_: Kate and Sophie were an example during their relationship. The former is quite butch in her looks, while Sophie's very feminine. The same goes for Kate with Julia and Reagan, who are both very feminine too.
-   _Betty_: Kirt dates a very femme girl, while she's a Butch Lesbian herself.
-   _The Boys (2019)_: "We Gotta Go Now" has this enforced In-Universe by the marketing team of Vought that, for PR reasons, think Queen Maeve and her ex-girlfriend Elena should be respectively portrayed as a Lipstick Lesbian and a Butch Lesbian, "like Ellen and Portia." Even though Queen Maeve is not even a lesbian. That goes without mentioning Vought's decision to switch Maeve's so far largely tomboyish image into that of a Lipstick Lesbian, rather than simply handing that role off to Elena and at least avoid a jarring shift in their marketing. Instead it's proposed for Elena, who is more of a Lipstick Lesbian, to make herself over as a Butch Lesbian, which she of course refuses.
-   _Carnival Row_: Vignette and Tourmaline dated in the past. Later they rekindle their relationship and marry. They're a Tomboy and Girly Girl pair.
-   _Cold Case_: In "Best Friends" Butch Lesbian Billie and Lipstick Lesbian Rose become a couple.

    -   Another prominent romantic relationship was between fashionable Lovable Alpha Bitch Paige and tough-as-nails delinquent/bad girl Alex.
-   _Deputy_: Butch Lesbian Bishop dates Lipstick Lesbian Genevieve. They break up as Genevieve doesn't accept Bishop's coming out as nonbinary. Bishop moves on and dates Julie, another Lipstick Lesbian.
-   _Euphoria_: Rue is pretty tomboyish, compared with Jules's highly feminine attire and looks.
-   _Everything Now_:
    -   Mia is a fairly tomboyish girl, with short hair and grungy, boyish clothes. Both the girls she's linked to, Carli and Alison, are quite feminine.
    -   Camp Gay boy Will later becomes involved with more masculine bisexual boy Theo.
-   _Extraordinary Attorney Woo_: Episode 2's client is revealed to be a closet lesbian in a Secret Relationship with her "best friend." The client is feminine and has long hair and makeup, while her girlfriend is a suit-wearing Bifauxnen with a short haircut.
-   _Feel Good_: Conventionally feminine George and really boyish Mae.
-   _Fellow Travelers_:
    -   Straight Gay man Marcus and Drag Queen Frankie date in the early 1950s.
    -   Jokingly invoked by Timothy Laughlin when he and his ex-boyfriend Hawkins Fuller are at a fancy fundraising gala while attired in tuxedos. Although they're both Straight Gays, Tim is a Pretty Boy while Hawk is Tall, Dark, and Handsome, so Tim recognizes that some people who see them together might assume that he's the "feminine" partner.
        
        **Tim**: It feels like we're on a date.  
        **Hawk**: I should warn you, I may make a pass.  
        **Tim**: A girl can hope, can't she?
        
-   _First Kill_: Girly Juliette and tomboyish Cal become a couple.
-   _Gentleman Jack_ pairs the outrageously masculine (for the time period) Anne Lister with the very feminine Ann Walker.
-   Subverted on _Glee_ with Kurt and Blaine. It would seem at first glance that Kurt is the fem partner and Blaine the masc. Kurt may be more outwardly flamboyant, but Blaine isn't _quite_ Straight Gay himself, and their personalities, mannerisms, and interests ultimately have more similarities than differences.
-   In a _The Golden Girls_ episode in which Blanche and Dorothy are mistaken for a lesbian couple, Blanche is all too happy to declare that she handles the cooking and cleaning, while Dorothy "takes out the garbage."
-   _Gossip Girl (2021)_: Max's dads are an example before breaking up. Roy is a Straight Gay average guy, and Gideon's a Camp Gay crossdresser with long hair.
-   _Gotham Knights (2023)_: A downplayed example as femme lesbian Stephanie and tomboyish bisexual Harper get together near the end of the first season. Neither is that pronounced however in their style.
-   _The Haunting of Bly Manor_: The feminine Dani falls in love with and ultimately marries Jamie, the more masculine gardener of Bly Manor (both are lesbians).
-   _Hightown_: Jackie is quite butch, and her ex-girlfriend was very feminine. She also knows another female couple who have this dynamic. Later she's also with Leslie, who's more feminine as well (although the contrast isn't as strong).
-   _In the Dark_: Jess, who's feminine, and her second girlfriend Sterling, who has very butch looks in comparison.
-   _Intergalactic_: Butch Lesbian Verona and Ash, who's a more feminine bisexual woman, get involved over the course of the first season.
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_: Louis de Pointe du Lac and Lestat de Lioncourt are depicted as the "bride" and "groom" when Louis is held by Lestat in a Bridal Carry after their Metaphorical Marriage, plus Louis moves into Lestat's townhouse, which is analogous to a wife relocating to her husband's home after their wedding (this was standard practice during The Edwardian Era). Louis is the younger and more slender Pretty Boy of the two men, with his beauty being remarked upon In-Universe, whereas Lestat is more conventionally handsome with a square jawline and broader shoulders. During lovemaking, it's generally Louis who's the bottom and Lestat who's the top, and because the latter is mentoring the former in vampirism, Lestat and Louis are also Lover and Beloved. Although Lestat is only slightly larger and taller than Louis (Sam Reid is 178 cm / 5'10" while Jacob Anderson 175 cm / 5'9"), his vampire strength is _much_ greater than that of his boyfriend due to Lestat being a lot older, so in a fight, Lestat can easily turn Louis into a bloody pulp, but the latter can't even leave a scratch on the former. Claudia dubs Louis as the "housewife" when she's irritated at how passive Louis is in the face of Lestat's more aggressive personality. There's also the gossip around town that Lestat is Louis' Sugar Daddy despite the latter being rich in his own right, a rumour that Louis never openly refutes even though it's emasculating for him to be perceived as the "kept woman." In "The Thing Lay Still", they dance together at the Mardi Gras ball with Lestat leading and Louis in the female position. Lestat intends to forge his own Vampire's Harem with Louis as the male equivalent of his Top Wife and Antoinette Brown as his second wife, who was previously his mistress and whom Lestat has turned into a vampire.
-   _Intimate_: Gruff, emotionally unavailable Leo is in a relationship with the feminine Florian. Their roles in the bedroom are also clearly defined at Leo's insistence. After their straight friends tell them they are considering switching things up in the bedroom with her pegging him, a fight ensues when Leo outright calls Florian the '"woman" in the relationship.
    
    **Leo:** I don't mean biologically speaking, just… of course we're both men… but on a social...  
    **Florian:** …level we're a gay couple between two men.  
    **Leo:** …in which you're the woman.  
    **Florian:** I'm not a woman! And I'm not gonna turn into one because, I dunno, I'm letting you pay for my coffee once in a while… or because I'm bossy? Is it that? Cause you're the top you’re the "male part"? If Isabella takes Max from behind, does that make her the man in their relationship then?  
    **Leo:** In that moment, maybe, yeah.  
    **Florian:** Is _this_ the only way you can feel comfortable with being gay?
    
-   _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_ parodies the idea in "Mac Fights Gay Marriage." Charlie and Frank are considering entering a domestic partnership for health benefits, but neither wants to be "the woman" in the relationship. They decide to consult Mac's ex Carmen (the only LGBT person they know), who frustratedly explains to them that _neither_ of them would be "the woman" because they're both men.
-   _Jupiter's Legacy_: Jacinda is a short-haired tomboy, her girlfriend Gabriella has long hair and more of a feminine look.
-   _Kröd Mändoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire_: Arcadius (Manly Gay) and Bruce (Camp Gay), before the former was killed.
-   _Law & Order_: The episode "Married With Children" involves a woman being tried for the murder of her ex-wife, who had sole custody of their daughter after their divorce. When it's mentioned that the defendant was a stay-at-home mom and the victim the family breadwinner, the judge makes a snide comment about not expecting a gay couple to fit such a "traditional" dynamic.
-   _A League of Their Own (2022)_:
    -   Butch Lesbian Vi, the gay bar's owner, is married to Edie, a Lipstick Lesbian (unofficially, this being the 1940s).
    -   After adopting her butch style, Max begins a relationship with the more feminine lesbian S (Esther).
    -   Lupe, a Butch Lesbian, dates the pitcher of the Comets, a Lipstick Lesbian.
-   _Lip Service_:
    -   Cat, a Lipstick Lesbian, seems to prefer soft butch women, dating Sam and Frankie (who both qualify).
    -   Tess, also a Lipstick Lesbian, dates Fin (a proud Lesbian Jock).
-   _The L Word_:
    -   Shane is bifauxnen and always dates more feminine women.
    -   Jenny is pretty girly and thus had this dynamic with the very butch Moira (before his transition to Max anyway). She also later dates Shane for a short period.
    -   Mostly girlish Alice has a relationship with tough Butch Lesbian soldier Tasha.
    -   Elegant, high-class femme Helena hooks up with her intimidating butch cellmate Dusty while in jail.
-   _The Mick_: Sabrina (a girl with long hair who likes to wear blouses, skirts, or dresses pretty often, while having traditionally feminine interests) is with Alexis, a short-haired lesbian jock in "The Juice" who's only shown wearing her uniform and workout clothing. They don't last long, however.
-   _Motherland: Fort Salem_: Raelle is a short-haired, taciturn tomboy. Scylla is long-haired, having a more average feminine appearance. They become lovers at Fort Salem during basic training.
-   _The O.C._: Marissa, a privileged rich girl, had a relationship with Alex, a bad girl bartender.
-   _Once Upon a Time_: Ruby and Dorothy. Downplayed as they're both Action Girls, but Ruby (who wears stylish clothes and makeup and has salon-perfect hair at all times) presents as much more traditionally feminine than Dorothy, who wears a practical and utilitarian dress, ties her hair back in a simple ponytail and is generally rougher and more unkempt.
-   _One of Us is Lying_:
    -   Cooper is more Manly Gay and a jock. His boyfriend Kris is a bit camp; he's flamboyant and wears earrings.
    -   Janae is a Butch Lesbian who starts dating Maeve, a much more feminine bisexual girl.
-   _Only Murders in the Building_:
    -   Mabel, who favors a feminine style, is revealed to be bisexual as she dates tomboy lesbian Alice in season 2.
    -   Camp Gay Howard and more Straight Gay Jonathan get together in Season 2.
-   _Orange Is the New Black_:
    -   Nicky and Lorna are Friends with Benefits (though Lorna later cuts off the benefits). The former is a loudmouthed Lad-ette with Messy Hair and the personality of a frat boy, the latter is a sweet, cheerful, idealistic, always dolled-up Girly Girl.
    -   A downplayed example with Piper, a privileged, somewhat naive, self-described WASP, and her regular Love Interest Alex, a street-smart Aloof Dark-Haired Girl and former drug dealer who grew up poor.
    -   Piper also serves as the feminine to her Love Interest in season 3, Stella, an androgynous girl with Boyish Short Hair and many tattoos.
    -   Poussey Washington is a Sassy Black Woman who keeps her hair buzzed. Her looks and mannerisms are conventionally unfeminine. Her German girlfriend who we see in flashbacks, however, was very feminine. She later dates Brook Soso, a bubbly, insecure Granola Girl.
    -   Season 5 has Big Boo, a Brawn Hilda who is by far the most butch character on the show, having a sexual relationship with Linda, a very elegant businesswoman (who is pretending to be an inmate.)
    -   Season 6 has the long-haired, conventionally feminine Daya romantically involved with the short-haired pimp/drug dealer Daddy who is clearly a Butch Lesbian (although for Daya it's Situational Sexuality, and Daddy may be transgender).
    -   Nicky briefly has a relationship with Egyptian ICE detainee Shani, who's very feminine.
-   _The Pact_: The Butch Lesbian Cat (who has short hair, masculine dress sense, and an Ambiguous Criminal History) enters a relationship with the feminine bisexual Tish.
-   _Pandora_: Jax and Cordelia, her ex, are a mild example. The former has long hair and is more prone to wear stylish dresses. Cordelia has short hair and is more tomboyish in her clothing style. She'll wear a dress at formal affairs though.
-   Discussed and defied in the first episode of _Queer Eye (2018)_, where the heterosexual Tom asks the gay Bobby if he's the husband or the wife in his marriage. Jonathan and Bobby point out that it's a misconception, a little sexist, and that lines between masculinity and femininity are becoming increasingly blurred, even with straight couples.
    
    **Bobby**: We both wear the pants.
    
-   Tony and Steve from _Reaper_ are two gay demons who have been together since before they fell from Heaven. While both are pretty campy, Tony is the more aggressive of the two and is more traditionally masculine, while Steve wears bright pastels and is the more effeminate and levelheaded of the two sticking with the original plan of simply being good when Tony and the other reformed demons instead try to violently slay the Devil, ascending back to angelhood in the process.
-   _RFDS (2021)_: Matty isn't _very_ campy, but he is a flight nurse rather than a doctor and is nonconfrontational and a little neurotic by nature, and does a drag act in episode 8. He starts a relationship with Ferret, a Manly Gay hunter he meets on the job with Eliza.
-   _The Rising_: Neve is a short-haired young woman with masculine clothing who's a biker. She and Alex, a woman around her age with long hair and a more feminine dress style (but not by much), become a couple (in spite of Neve being a ghost while this happens).
-   _Riverdale_: Kevin plays up the Camp Gay and Gay Best Friend stereotypes. So far his main love interests were Moose (a macho Armored Closet Gay football player) and Joaquin (a member of a biker gang).
-   _Roswell, New Mexico_: Season 2 sees Isobel, who's fairly feminine (with long hair, wearing makeup, jewelry, skirts, etc often) date a more butch female bartender who has short hair and more masculine attire.
-   Averted on _Rupauls Drag Race_, where several contestants have been romantically involved with other drag queens (including other contestants), or someone else more on the Camp Gay side. For instance, the husband of season 4 contestant Chad Michaels is a costume designer who created most of Chad's dresses on the runway. From what we've seen of the queens' partners, either on the show or on social media, the majority aren't without some level of camp.
-   _Schitt's Creek_: The effete, style-obsessed, high-strung, and woefully nonathletic David is paired with the Straight Gay Patrick, who was closeted for most of his life.
-   _The Shannara Chronicles_: Tomboy Eretria is with Girly Girl Lyria in Season Two.
-   _Spartacus: Blood and Sand_ uses this sometimes. The first example is butch gladiator Barca and gentle slave Alexios, which ends tragically when Barca is murdered and Alexios is unable to defend himself from being repeatedly raped by another Jerkass gladiator, driving him to kill himself. In the latter part of the story, hot-headed macho gladiator turned rebel Agron is paired with the gentler, calmer, and less intimidating, though still pretty deadly, Nasir. Other gay pairings in the show don't have this arrangement.
-   _Swarm_: Dre, after adopting the name Tony and a more masculine look (short hair, T-shirts, jeans, boxers) becomes involved with Rashida, a feminine woman with long hair who wears fairly revealing blouses or dresses.
-   _S.W.A.T. (2017)_: In "Never Again" Chris, a fairly butch woman, is dating Kira, who's quite femme. In an unusual example, both are bisexual.
-   _Switched at Birth_: Natalie is fairly feminine, in contrast to her girlfriend Hilary, who's more masculine and has short hair. The latter pointedly refuses to wear a dress for the prom, going in a tuxedo instead. They get barred as a result, because their school dress code requires girls wear dresses. In protest, they stage their own prom dance on the lawn outside with friends.
-   _Tipping the Velvet (2002)_: A lot of the lesbian couples the series display this dynamic. Here it's shown as working-class butch women who are in men's clothing beside aristocratic rich feminine lesbians wearing fine dresses, hats, etc., the accepted high society attire of the day.
-   _Twenties_: Hattie's been with Lorraine and Ida B. While she's very butch, to the point of being mistaken for male, both are quite feminine.
-   _Utopia Falls_: Reserved and more girly Sage is slowly drawn into a romance with bold, tomboyish Brooklyn during the first season.
-   _Vida_:
    -   Vidalia was feminine, while her wife Eddy is really butch.
    -   In the second season, feminine Emma gets involved with Nico, who's butch.
-   _We Are Who We Are_: Discussed by Richard while speaking with his wife Jenny. He claims all same-sex couples must have this dynamic, that it couldn't work anyway else. Sarah and Maggie are an example in terms of their clothing/hairstyles to a mild degree, though otherwise don't qualify.
-   _The Wilds_: Mildly butch lesbian Toni and feminine Shelby officially get together in Season 2 once Shelby's admitted her attraction to women. Toni's ex Regan was also more femme, we see in flashbacks.
-   In _Will & Grace_, Will is the manly man to Jack's feminine man. Behind the scenes, the actor who played Will won the part over an actual gay man who was perceived as too manly to be a convincing gay man (which is Hilarious in Hindsight, because the actor in question was John Barrowman).
-   _The Wire_ Kima is a Lad-ette and her wife is a ladylike academic. Omar's first onscreen partner, Brandon, is very effeminate, but later seasons has him mostly paired with other Straight Gay men.
-   _Yellowjackets_: Van is a butch lesbian who has short hair and masculine clothing, while her girlfriend in the 1990s, Taissa, wears her hair long initially with a more feminine dress style.

    Music Videos 

    Theater 

-   Downplayed with _The Children's Hour_ and its second film adaptation. It's not noticeable due to Values Dissonance; however, Martha was considered tomboyish for the time. Her Ambiguously Bi best friend and crush Karen is more of a girly girl compared to her. The two are Mistaken for Romance by a student, which causes a scandal. Martha is very closeted about her sexuality and ends up Driven to Suicide before she gets to even date a woman.
-   _RENT_ has the Straight Gay\-bordering-on-Manly Gay Collins with the flamboyant, more feminine queer character Angel (whose gender identity is not really clarified).

    Video Games 

-   _Atelier Ayesha: The Alchemist of Dusk_: Regina's boss Glide tells her that she won't find a husband if she carries on with her hard-drinking, monster-fighting lifestyle. Regina replies that she can always marry Ayesha. However, this **is** an _Atelier Series_ game: Regina's _behaviour_ may be in-universe butch, but visually this would be a very Feminine/Feminine couple.
-   Zig-zagged in _Cyberpunk 2077_:
    -   Male V's Gay Option is Kerry Eurodyne, who himself blends a lot of masculine and camp traits. V can be made to look either very campy, with long, colorful hair, makeup, feminine clothing, and long, painted nails, or almost indistinguishable from a perceived straight man. You can't, however, make him act in a camp way. Behavior and personality-wise, Kerry will usually be a more feminine one, due to his leaner build, Guyliner, slight lisp in some dubs, and penchant for drama, contrasting V's more stoic nature and more muscular build. While Kerry is fully capable of protecting himself, he has nothing on V, who works as a mercenary and is practically a One-Man Army.
    -   Female V's Gay Option is Judy Alvarez, who, likewise, cannot be neatly put in either the "butch" or "femme" box. Female V can also be anywhere from a typical butch, to a very feminine woman. Judy's more introverted and works as a techie, and while she can take a more active role, she prefers to stay on the sidelines. V, on the other hand, is a mercenary One-Man Army like her male counterpart, with a Ladette personality. Worth noting that Judy's past girlfriend was a very femme Maiko, and it's implied she was in love with the Femme Fatale Evelyn, making her the more masculine one, with her more tomboyish clothing, penchant for working with machines and fiery outbursts.
-   _Dead Estate_: Cordelia and Fuji are the game's Official Couple, with Cordelia being a curvy, large-breasted Hot Witch and Fuji being an incredibly tall and ripped Amazonian Beauty.
-   _The Devil in Me_ features one of Supermassive Games' first ever confirmed same-gender romantic couples, pairing the Butch Lesbian Jamie with the Lipstick Lesbian Erin. It's quite the contrast to the studio's first potential queer romance in _The Quarry_ (which came out just a few months prior), in which Ryan and his Gay Option love interest Dylan are both very much presented as low-key Straight Gay (or bi) guys with no especially stereotypical behaviours of any sort.
-   _Dragon Age II_ lets you play with this. A male Hawke (especially the default with the beard and rugged look) seems pretty "butch" compared to Fenris or Anders (your uncle will even say that he doesn't have to ask "which one of you is the girl" if you're romancing one of them). Hawke can be designed and played much less butch, but the male love interests are pretty no matter how you swing it.
-   _Dragon Age: Inquisition_:
    -   If neither Camp Gay Dorian nor Manly Pansexual Iron Bull is romanced by the Inquisitor, they will eventually fall for each other.
    -   Also, since the Inquisitor's looks and personality are entirely up to the player, any gay or lesbian relationship they pursue can end up like this.
-   _Haven (2020)_: In both same-sex romance options, Kay is the emotionally vulnerable, animal-loving biologist and expert cook, while Yu is the more hard-nosed mechanic. Their appearances also invoke this, albeit the other way around; Kay is taller, slightly more muscular, and has short hair, while Yu is shorter, fairer-skinned, and has long, flowing hair tied with a ribbon.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _The Last of Us Part II_: Ellie and her girlfriend, Dina, with Ellie being more masculine and Dina more feminine. Ellie is a Butch Lesbian, with oversized clothes and shoulder-length hair (with some kept in a bun), while Dina has much longer hair and somewhat more fitting clothes. Dina is a Friend to All Children who loves romance books, cats, and wants to settle down on a farm one day, while Ellie prefers comic books, dogs, and doesn't seem to be as family-oriented. After the timeskip in the epilogue, we see Dina washing dishes and hanging out laundry to dry, while Ellie is tasked with herding their small herd of sheep, and writes about hunting a boar in her journal. Their hobbies somewhat subvert this: Ellie likes to draw, play on her guitar and write lyrics, while Dina has a penchant for electronic devices and likes to tinker.
-   _Life Is Strange_ franchise Downplays this, but it's still present.
    -   _Life Is Strange_: Both Max and Chloe are rather tomboyish. As kids, they played pirates and drew superhero comics. Chloe is a tall, aggressive ladette punk girl with short blue hair who steals a gun, and is quick to get physically aggressive. For her part, Max goes by a gender-neutral nickname, is almost always seen wearing unisex clothing, "doesn't get" makeup, and wears a loose, jaw-length bob. However, she's shorter, more sensitive and supportive than Chloe and even likes going to tea rooms with her friend Kate.
    -   _Life Is Strange: Before the Storm_: In this prequel, Chloe is still a rather butch punk rocker, though not quite as hard as she gets to be three years later, in the original game. Her romantic partner in this game, Rachel, is a Girly Girl with a Tomboy Streak. She wears her hair long, shows an affinity for fashion and cosmetics, and has a much girlier room than Chloe. However, her personal fashion style is quite grunge, preferring torn flannel shirts and jeans to more feminine attire.
    -   _Life Is Strange: True Colors_: Alex and her Gay Option love interest Steph are both for the most part tomboyish women with similar Nice Girl temperaments. However, Alex notably dons a skirt for the spring festival where she can ask either Steph or Ryan out on a date (which Steph comments on with some surprise, since she wasn't aware Alex even _owned_ a skirt), while Steph is never seen wearing anything other than trousers or shorts. If you choose to hook them up together, Alex being significantly shorter than Steph will become more obvious whenever they kiss or hug, which also plays into this trope.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   A lesbian Commander Shepard is always the "butch" one in every relationship, whether it be with Liara, Kelly, Samantha, Diana, or Samara. Although the last one is a Lady of War only _slightly_ more femme than Shepard.
    -   Downplayed with a gay male Commander Shepard. Kaidan Alenko and Steve Cortez are not effeminate by any means, but Shepard himself is a tough-as-nails Manly Gay and there's still a clear Sensitive Guy and Manly Man dynamic.
-   _The Outer Worlds:_ Parvati sees herself and Junlei as potentially being one:
    
    **Parvati:** Will she think I'm as pretty as I think she's handsome?
    
-   _Pokémon X and Y_ features a subtextual version between Brains and Brawn Frank and Sly. Psychics are effeminate-looking young men while Black Belts are muscular and masculine. Frank and Sly have some heavy Ho Yay in their dialogue.
-   In the Distant Finale game of _Power Instinct_ series, _Groove on Fight_, there's Rudolph Garthheimer (selectable character and also Sub-Boss) and Damian Shade (NPC in Arcade version and Secret Character in the Sega Saturn port), which also are the first gay couple in the series.
-   _SIGNALIS:_ In the game's final chapter, Elster is revealed to have been in a relationship with her Gestalt Officer Ariane. Elster is a cold and stoic Robot Soldier, while Ariane is a warm and passionate human non-combatant.

    Web Animation 

-   _The Acorn Princess_ follows two gay couples—the titular princess and her knight Nutalia, and the Flower Prince and his lover Beetle. Nutalia and Beetle are the more masculine of the pair, the former being a coolheaded and dashing figure while Beetle is muscular and boisterous, while Acorn and Flower are more soft-spoken and sensitive.
-   The page image is from Harry Partridge's "Stephen The Lesbian".
-   _Hazbin Hotel_: Played with in regards to girlfriends Charlie and Vaggie. Charlie has a Tomboyish Name, prefers to wear suits, and is a bifauxnen, whereas Vaggie has a more feminine name, wears dresses and hair bows and looks more conventionally feminine. However, Charlie is more soft-spoken, cheerful, and optimistic, while Vaggie is more aggressive, grumpy, and cynical.

    Webcomics 

-   Bernard and Ward in _Angel Down_ form one of these, with Ward being Straight Gay bordering on Manly Gay, Meanwhile Bernard is a full-blown male Meganekko.
-   _Crimson Dark_: Kari is revealed as being a lesbian, and fairly masculine in her appearance. Ren, though she also has boyish short hair, is the more feminine partner, somewhat girlish in comparison.
-   _Darkest Night_: Butch Lesbian Mags is secretly having sex with Ava, a more femme girl who has a boyfriend. Later she gets involved with her feminine trans woman friend Nessa after she and Ava break up.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, both Ellen and Nanase and Catalina and Rhoda. The former pair have shifted over time as to who is more masculine/feminine but they're rarely equally butch/femme. The latter pair are clearly butch/femme with Catalina being a Tomboy and Rhoda being more of a Girly Girl.
-   _Everything is Fine_ features same-sex couple Sophie and Kate. Sophie wears a tuxedo to the trial, while her wife Kate wears a dress.
-   In _Friendly Hostility_, Bootsie asks Collin and Fox at one point which one of them plays the woman. Collin is incensed and chews her out, saying that a gay couple doesn't need one member to be more feminine than the other and that his love of cock has no impact on his masculinity. Fox, however, correctly guesses that Bootsie was actually referring to the plaid skirt she found while doing their laundry and explains that Collin sometimes likes to roleplay as a slutty Catholic schoolgirl while they're having sex. So Collin _is_ more feminine than Fox, but not by that much considering that he's also an aspiring dictator who Hates Everyone Equally.
-   _Learning with Manga! FGO_ features this duo in the form of the Male Protagonist and Astolfo, the romantic counterparts to Gudako and Mash. The Male Protagonist is perpetually horny (a trait usually associated with overeager boyish types) and fairly average in masculine looks, while his crush Astolfo is more subdued, wears a lot of reds and pinks, and is pretty to the point of borderline femininity. Later strips would show that the Male Protagonist invokes the trope since androgynous boys (and Ambiguous Gender Identity people in general) are his type.
    -   The one time we see Dr. Roman in any kind of pairing, he (a passive long-haired Pretty Boy in canon) is forcibly paired up with the Berserker from _Fate/stay night_ (a beefy, masculine brute).
    -   The Children Kingdom invokes this with their designated "parents," as they choose Altera (a warrior with anger issues whose historical counterpart was male) to be their father and Helena and later Mash (both level-headed and somewhat calm women) to be their mother. Averted appearance-wise, as all the girls in question are femme.
-   _Lovebot's_ leading couple consists of Xada, who while having luxurious long hair is muscular and has the generally masculine job of robot repair/customization and computer hacking; and Lacey, a sensitive robot who prefers pastel colors and often wears feminine leaning clothing.
