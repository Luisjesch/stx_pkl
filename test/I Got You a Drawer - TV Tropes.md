Poor dope thinks there's something in there for him.

Sue knows that Bob is going to give her a present — a really romantic present. After hours (or days) of giddy anticipation and increasingly extravagant guesses, she arrives at Bob's apartment for the big moment. With a big smile, Bob walks over to his dresser and pulls out one of the drawers, but when Sue moves closer in to peer into the drawer it's completely and totally empty. The big gift was _nothing_? Is this some kind of joke? A cruel kiss-off?

Nope — Bob's gift _is_ the drawer.

Used for showing the escalation of a relationship with characters who so far have been emotionally guarded or whose previous relationships have all been strictly casual, but who now want to show their lover that they're ready to let them into their lives. Often carries the implication of exclusivity, if it did not exist already. May also mark the slide from Friends with Benefits into an actual relationship.

It's a move with repercussions. Not only does offering a drawer allow Sue the practical expedient of leaving clothes at Bob's place indefinitely, but the gift of a drawer also carries symbolic resonance, since dresser drawers (especially the sock drawer) are not only for the keeping of one's most personal garments, but are also proverbially places where people stash away secret valuables and important mementos — a solid, protective, intimate space to store things of sentimental meaning. Plus, a drawer _opens up_ — just like Bob is doing. Cute, huh?

The drawer can signify a shift into a long-term relationship. Leaving a toothbrush says the lover is sleeping over for the time being, but giving a drawer implies shared space and time and the prospect of a future together — and a permanent end to the walk of shame. On the flip side, could also mean that the carefully compartmentalized space of a dresser drawer is the _only_ part of Bob's life he's ready to open up to Sue.

If the intimacy upgrade is unwanted, it might lead to the awkwardness of an unwanted gift.

-   _Burn Notice_: A close variant in "Bloodlines". After Fiona is forced to move out of her house, one of the criteria for a new place is that there has to be room for her souvenir snowglobe collection. At the end of the episode, Michael offers her a board of lumber as a present, which is to be a shelf for the snowglobes in his loft. He finally spits it out after some fumbling: "I want you to move in."
-   _Castle (2009)_: Halfway through their first season as a (secret) couple, Castle and Beckett exchange romantic Valentine's Day gifts. After Castle's goes awry (he accidentally slips his gift, a pair of beautiful earrings, into Beckett's boss's blazer instead of hers, leading to a wacky misunderstanding), we get the big reveal of Beckett's gift: a drawer. Of course, this being Castle, it takes him a minute to get it, and he feels all around the inside for his promised romantic present.
-   In _Friends_, Chandler, who was always trying to fend off Janice in their earlier encounters, now has feelings for her but paralyzed by his fear of commitment. When Joey tells him to face his fears, he goes all in, and the gift of a drawer is only the first in a series of increasingly over-the-top commitment-filled gestures that backfire badly. In this case, it's literally the gift of a drawer — he gives her some contact paper and then hands her the actual drawer itself.
    
    **Chandler:** Well, wait there's, more. See, the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. _(gives her a drawer)_ See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.  
    **Janice:** Oh, you didn't have to do this.  
    **Chandler:** Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.  
    —>**Janice:** Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer?

    **Cameron:** Why would I keep inviting you over if I didn't want you there?
    
    **Chase:** You always kick me out every morning. You never offered me a drawer, never cleared out your closet for me. I was just a visitor.

    **Hathaway:** I know, but now you're communicating a little too much.
    
    **Ross:** This is important. Can I have a drawer?
