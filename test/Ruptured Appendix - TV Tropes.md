_"Nurse, it's an appendix!"_

When writers want to add a little drama but don't want to spend a lot of time building up symptoms and later dealing with recovery, they'll dust off this old chestnut: The Burst Appendix.

What makes appendicitis great for writers is that it can affect an otherwise completely healthy character with little or no advance warning (in sharp contrast to real life appendicitis, for reasons explained below), a sort of Sickness Ex Machina if you will, and instantly creates a sense of ticking-time-bomb tension as the character must get the appendix removed before it explodes. The situation also takes delightfully little time to fix: rush your character through some emergency surgery, spend a few seconds admiring the cool, new scar, and that's it; roll credits.

You can expect fictional portrayals of appendicitis to ignore all of the other symptoms associated with it in favor of the intense, stabbing and often completely debilitating pain that appears in your abdomen. While this is a major symptom, as well as typically being the biggest red flag that something is very, very wrong with your body, it is not the _only_ symptom — others include mild fever, forms of irritable bowel syndrome, nausea/vomiting, loss of appetite, among other unpleasant things. In fact, many of these symptoms (especially the fever and nausea) often come _before_ the intense abdominal pain arrives.

As a fairly common and thus well-known condition, appendicitis/ruptured appendix also falls under Small Reference Pools. Tonsillitis, and occasionally gall stones, can get similar treatment. Gall stones also add some drama in that they are less dangerous but have _extremely_ similar symptoms to the appendicitis, thus adding suspense due to the need to distinguish them.

If you have severe stomach pain in the lower right side or that started there and spread,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  go to an emergency room. _Do not_ take an enema or laxative or otherwise try to force a bowel movement — the pressure/stimulation of bowel contractions can cause the appendix to rupture. Also, _have the surgery_, because while it may give you a scar (which will be quite small if they use an laparoscope) and may result in some occasional bowel issues later in life due to the appendix hosting beneficial bacteria, both of those can be easily dealt with — and the surgery is the only absolute cure that ensures the condition won't worsen and kill you, or return if cured via antibiotics or other nonsurgical treatment.

-   In Roald Dahl's autobiography _Boy_, Dahl tells of how his older sister died from appendicitis, which devasted their father. This also happened with his older half-sister, who was successfully treated. He later recalls being so homesick during his first term at boarding school that he tried Playing Sick by faking appendicitis, just to be able to go home for a few days. The school doctor was fooled, and Dahl was taken home, but another doctor wasn't fooled (the lack of physical symptoms, despite the boy's Large Ham performance in screaming with pain, was a dead giveaway), and agreed to keep Dahl's secret.
    
    **Roald Dahl**: You might think it silly that a nine-year-old could imagine that he would get away with a trick like that, but I had sound reasons for trying it on. My ancient half-sister had actually _had_ appendicitis, so I was able to observe her behaviour at close quarters.
    
-   Lu Clarke has one in _Cherry Ames: Mountaineer Nurse_ by Julie Tatham. Since she's in a remote valley, she barely makes it to the hospital in time.
-   In George R. Stewart's 1949 novel _Earth Abides_ Isherwood Williams, who has survived a global plague and is one of the few survivors on Earth, makes a list of positive things that may indicate his survival.

-   _The Garden of Sinners_ has an excellent example: The main villain of the third novel, Fujino Asagami, has a severe case of appendicitis, which leads her to believe she'd been stabbed. (It's complicated.) By the end of the episode, her condition has worsened to a point where even immediate attention is pointless; she's vomiting blood and barely able to crawl. And that's before we mention the killer chasing her, or the repeated rapes she endured previously. It ends comparably well for her, when Ryougi Shiki (who can kill any_thing_) kills _the appendicitis inside Fujino_ with her powers and saves her life.

When Mrs. Zimmerman gets to the hospital, it's revealed that the pain was too high to have been her appendix. Mrs. Zimmerman tells Rose Rita that she suspects it was actually the effects of a dark magic curse someone used on her.
-   _The Hunt for Red October_: Due to drunkenness while on duty, a surgeon botched removing an inflamed appendix from the wife of Marko Ramius, the organ bursting because the doctor took too long to try to sober up by breathing pure oxygen.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

Thankfully her appendix remains in one piece and she recovers.
-   _Lethal White_: Cormoran's nephew Jack's appendix actually does rupture, and it nearly kills him.

-   _This Side of Paradise_: Around the beginning of the novel, Amory's appendix ruptured in the middle of a trip in Italy, likely the result of his mother making him have multiple Breakfasts in Bed. He had to be sent to New York to get a operation to deal with his ruptured appendix.

    Real Life 

-   This trope is Truth in Television — and it's actually _quite_ common that almost everyone has at least _heard_ of appendicitis or an appendix injury.
    -   It's also surprisingly common for assumed appendicitis cases to turn out to be false alarms...and sometimes, they don't realize this until _after_ the offending organ is removed!
    -   It's common for childhood appendicitis to be mistaken for stomach flu—even by the doctors. This can result in the child not getting their appendix removed until after it has ruptured. Worse still, it may end with the poor kid dying as a result of peritonitis, with the parents Outliving One's Offspring.
-   Harry Houdini died of a ruptured appendix, which may or may not have been exacerbated by someone punching him in the stomach a few days earlier—one theory is that he may have attributed the early symptoms of appendicitis to pain from the blow, and did not seek help as soon as he would have otherwise.
-   Leonid Rogozov, a Russian doctor, got appendicitis. While on an expedition in Antarctica. Where he was the only doctor. So he operated on himself.
    -   This led to a policy of preemptively removing the appendix of critical staff members (with their consent) before any trip to the base.
-   Similar to the Rogozov example above, some jobs and/or activities that involve traveling to remote areas where evacuation is difficult or impossible will also require or at least suggest preemptively removing the appendix.

He demanded to be sent home to Japan to die, and somehow, against all odds, recovered once he was back in Japan, becoming one of the very, very few people to survive a ruptured appendix and subsequent peritonitis.
-   Masaki Koh, a gay adult video star, developed appendicitis but refused surgery for several reasons (including appearance and that his condition was so advanced that the surgery itself could have ruptured the appendix) and instead chose nonsurgical treatment with antibiotics and the like. Unfortunately, his appendix ruptured, and he would later die from abdominal peritonitis.
-   Ringo Starr, drummer of the The Beatles, nearly died at age six from peritonitis; he missed a year of school while recovering and remained sickly for most of his childhood as a result.
