**Nancy:** What I learned in the dream clinic. That's what I'm trying to prove, Mother. Rod didn't kill Tina and he didn't hang himself. There's this guy. He's after us in our dreams.  
**Marge:** But that's just not reality, Nancy.

Sometimes, in fiction, the dreamer isn't the only one seeing his or her dream. Sometimes another character sees the dream or can enter it and become part of it. Sometimes it's played straight, other times for laughs, with a statement like, "Hey, this is my dream!" or "Hey, it's your dream."

Sometimes characters do this for malevolent reasons, seeking to terrify and/or harm the dreamer for their own purposes (like Freddy Krueger); others devote their abilities to protect dreamers from such threats (like Doctor Strange).

Compare/contrast Dream Weaver and Dream Stealer, which can overlap. Also compare/contrast with Shared Dream, where characters all have a shared, collective dream. Not to be confused with Dream Spying. See also Talking in Your Dreams. If a Dream Walker is able to take objects bacl into the waking world, see also Taken from a Dream.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _18if_: Protagonist Haruto Tsukishiro, by virtue of being trapped in a Dream Land, can enter the dreams of others.
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_:
    -   Ayakashi are spirits that can enter humans' dreams by possessing them. When an ikon possessing Lu drains her life until she loses consciousness, it tries to attack her in her dreams to take the rest. Suzu can effectively enter dreams as well via creating an omokage Remote Body, but this also seems to connect things to _her_ dreams, and thus her subconscious.
    -   Matsuri is a more complicated variant. When he exorcises an ayakashi from someone, he sends a fragment of his spiritual power into them, and if they're dreaming it appears to them as Matsuri's Residual Self-Image. However, while this fragment acts as Matsuri would (though it seems incapable of speech), the actual Matsuri has no awareness of what is sees and originally didn't even know it _existed_.
-   This is Yuko's primary demonic power in _The Demon Girl Next Door_, overlapping with Dream Weaver. Yuko can enter the dreams of basically anything capable of dreaming, as long as she and her target are both asleep, and while there, she can manifest into being virtually anything she can imagine. Thing is, she doesn't have a very good imagination. She initially thinks that it's a pretty lame power to have, until her initial uses of it show that her dream manipulation is just a Required Secondary Power for what she's really capable of: manipulating the subconscious mind of the dreamer, as dreams are the window into the subconscious. When she finds she can do things like plant unconscious suggestions, create phobias or cravings, or even overwrite emotions to make bitter enemies into grudging friends, she realizes her abilities are a lot more dangerous than she thought and is disgusted with herself, even though her friends remind her that all she had ever used her powers for is to bring happiness to the people around her.
-   _Doraemon: Nobita's Three Visionary Swordsmen_ have Nobita and Doraemon having adventures in the dream world of Yumemiru, and feeling lonely, Nobita actually convinced Doraemon to use the machine to drag his friends Shizuka, Suneo and Gian _into_ his dream. Much to the annoyance of the latter two, since Gian is dreaming about holding a global concert while Suneo's about to dream of going to a vacation in Mars.
-   _Uta∽Kata_ starts off its main plot with the protagonist seeing a girl come out of a mirror and settle into her life; but she realises the same girl appeared in her dreams, and recalling how those dreams went becomes an important piece of foreshadowing.
-   In _X/1999_, Hinoto's sister Kanoe is more of this than a Dream Weaver (save for the TV series). Also Hokuto Sumeragi straddles the line: she can enter other people's dreams, alright, but has very few _actual_ influence on them _and_ can only do it when she herself is asleep, while the others can do it when awake too.
-   _Why the Hell Are You Here, Teacher!?_ has a chapter where Mad Scientist Nanjou-sensei invents a machine to do this to Tadashi. Of course being the genre that it is, it's an Erotic Dream.

    Comic Books 

-   _Anderson: Psi-Division_: Both the Sisters of Death and Judge Death have invaded Judge Anderson's dreams on separate occasions.
-   _Bone_: Those with a powerful dreaming eye have the ability to influence or invade the dreams of others. Dragons are naturally powerful dreamers and seem to have this ability as a rule, which comes in handy when the Great Red Dragon is forbidden from directly interfering with the war, as he can still guide Thorn and Fone Bone through their dreams.
-   Doctor Strange has occasionally entered the dreams of clients to help them. His enemy, Nightmare, can control dreams and gain power through them.
-   In _Lucy Dreaming_, Lucy and her friend Welsey enter the same dream more than once. Not only that, in the first issue, Lucy encounters someone else who is having the same dream, who she later suspects is Welsey's missing father.
-   As originally established in the show, Princess Luna from the _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (IDW)_ has this ability. She's even described as the "Protector of Dreams".
-   _The New Universe_ character Nightmask has this as his superpower.
-   In Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker, the Dream World and its hub city of Genesis is explained as the result of the collective dreaming subconscious of humanity. Lucid dreamers are able to experience the collective dreams of everyone else given form as a specific place.
-   _Rising Stars_: One person has this power.
-   _The Sandman (1989)_:
    -   In "Sandman: The Doll's House", Rose Walker can do this during her brief time as a dream vortex.
    -   Dream himself can also do this, of course (being the Anthropomorphic Personification of dreaming) and regularly uses this ability throughout the series. Special note must be made of the time he hijacked a car that was being used as the set for an Erotic Dream and drove to London in it.
-   Ramona Flowers from _Scott Pilgrim_.
-   A little-seen mutant in the _X-Men_ comics named Rem-Ram has this as his power, as a sort of telepathy which works only on the sleeping. He can contact the mind of a person who is awake, but that causes him severe pain and possible neurological injury.
    -   A more powerful but just as discreet mutant is Fontanelle, the daughter of the villainess known as Black Womb, whose power consists indeed of walking into people's dreams and finding whichever she needs for intelligence.

    Fan Works 

-   _Cave Dancers Pretty Cure_: In Episode 4, Cure Dream enters a shared dream between Gobo and Red Fraggle to encourage them not to give up on their search for the Dance Crystals.

Her Opposite, the Lord or Lady of Nightmares, also has this ability. In the epilogue of the third story, Luna and Pharynx begin training Moondancer to dreamwalk as well, via Luna sharing her Mantle to make Moondancer the first of her Dreamguards, and the two (and Pharynx) soon discover that Luna and Pharynx's foal is likely to have this power naturally as well, via tapping their Mantles.
-   _Half Past Adventure_: Robin has this as part of zhir Combo Platter Powers, much like zhir great-grandfather Jake.

-   Luna enlists Scootaloo's help for this in _Moonlight_ to combat the nightmares induced by their mysterious opponent. Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom later join her to help.
-   _The New Adventures of Invader Zim_: Dib spends most of Episode 9 doing this, using a spell he's found to explore the dreams of all the other main characters.

Comes into play again in Episode 21, when he uses it to free his friends from the Lotus-Eater Machine that Norlock put them in.
-   _Past Sins_: _Glimpses 2_: "Dreams": Involves Twilight travelling into Nyx's dreams.

    -   Anabel discovers she can do this when she tries to force herself to sleep in Chapter 41. She ends up entering the dreams of Ash, Delia, and Iris.
-   _A Shadow of the Titans_: One chapter features Jade, as an extra credit assignment, using a spell to visit the dreams of her teammates.

-   _Steel Soul Saga_: _Steel Spirit_: In the first chapter, "Sparks of Faith", when Sweetie Belle thinks about Luna's powers to do this to stop nightmares, but she's not exactly a pony:

-   _Tantabus Mark II_: Combined with Dream Weaver; as in canon, Luna travels the dreams of her subjects to help them with their nightmares. The fic starts because Luna decided she needed some backup and repurposed her old Tantabus project to help.

The Tantabus ends up teaching a couple other ponies how to use dream magic.

-   Dream-walking is a part of Discworld magic, as both Wizards and Witches know. Unseen University even teaches how to do it to suitably inclined student Wizards and describes it as Walking The Astral Planes. Witches tend to pick it up informally and call it Stepping Out.

In a later tale, he has to rescue a daughter from the Dungeon Dimensions. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Later, his Witch-daughter meets a deceased Ancestor in a dream, who takes advantage of being outside time to show her some History. Bekki uses this knowledge to annoy her History teacher.

-   In _The Last Witch Hunter_, Chloe is one of rare witches gifted with this skill. It's considered a Dark gift and Kaulder tells her that the dreamwalkers used to be the Witch Queen's deadliest assassins (Your Mind Makes It Real is in effect), but Chloe uses it for the light side.
-   _The Matrix_ is a variant on this.
-   _A Nightmare on Elm Street_ centers on this type of thing. The villain Freddy Krueger, an undead serial killer, can enter anyone's dreams at will and manipulate them as much as he wants, using his powers to torment and slaughter his victims in increasingly creative ways. Any damage he does in a dream crosses over into the real world, making for some truly horrendous scenes.

    Literature

Later she starts learning on her own to create dream chambers and enter others' dreams, while shaping hers.
-   This is common in _Chronicles of the Kencyrath_:
    -   This gives an interesting twist to Erotic Dreams. If both people are in the dream as themselves, in control of their own actions, would dream sex be considered real? Timmon tries many times to have an Erotic Dream with Jame Once he's kicked out of the dream, in favor of another lover.

She later learns that she can pull an angel into her dream at will, which becomes useful for getting around her father's ban on premarital relations between Jessica and her angelic boyfriend...
-   H. P. Lovecraft's Dreamlands can be accessed by anybody who knows how, and you can actually meet other dreaming people there.
-   _Malazan Book of the Fallen_:
    -   K'rul appears in Kruppe's dreams because he can't fully manifest in the real world at the beginning of the series. He uses him as a connection to everyday mortal life in the waking world, informs him of happenings far away and even steers him to influence the power players in the city of Darujhistan. He also uses his dreams to organize the complicated rebirth/soulmeld of Silverfox, which involves not only dream walking, but Time Travel as well.
    -   Played with in the dreams of Udinaas. He does not himself walk in other people's dreams, but others, especially gods and those seeking power, are drawn to _his_ dreams like moths to a flame, sharing information with him, trying to seduce him to join their side or trying to spy on him. Udinaas eventually learns to banish anyone he doesn't want inside his dreams but just the fact that he has to guard against them means many a sleepless night for him.

-   In _The Wheel of Time_, Dreamwalkers can, among many other things, visit the dreams of others if they are so inclined.

-   _Charmed (1998)_: One of the only non-magical threats the sisters faced was the Dream Sorcerer, a human scientist who found a way to enter and control women's dreams. He used it to terrorize and murder (a la Freddie Kruger) women who rejected him.
-   _Roswell_: Isabel has this ability, and she seems to need a photo of the person to touch to be able to do this. Whether this is actually needed, or just because Isabel hasn't had proper training in the techniques is not clear. In the books that inspired the series, all the aliens can do this, and they can also bring humans into other people's dreams by holding their hand while they enter the dream.
-   In an episode of _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_, Sabrina gets a part time-job as a Sandman, which involves her using magic sand to help mortals sleep.

It is ultimately revealed that Daniel was truly appearing in Teal'c's dream at this point, bending the Ascended's rules against interference to offer his friend emotional support until the rest of the team could rescue him.
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   Angels can enter dreams to speak with the dreamer and deliver messages if they need to. This is sometimes the only way angels can communicate with Sam and Dean, who are often warded against (via hex bags) or physically marked against (via writing etched onto their ribs by Castiel) angels finding them personally. Castiel regularly visits Dean in his dreams, enough to that Dean has gotten used to it, but he's unnerved when Castiel says that it's not a secure space and they need to find a more private place to talk.
    -   Played for Laughs when Fallen Angel Anna walks in on an Erotic Dream Dean is having (involving two strippers in angel and devil costumes) much to his embarrassment.
    -   Azazel, the yellow-eyed demon, is also shown to be able to communicate with people this way, though he can sometimes also influence the dream.

    Music 

-   In David Byrne's song "The Dream Police", there's an entire justice system to prosecute crimes committed in sleep.
    
    Everyone has the same dreams, on different days of the week.  
    We are the watchdogs of your mind, we are the dream police.
    

    Myths & Religion 

-   A recurring notion in mysticism is that two people can and will share a dream if they are sufficiently connected, ideally emotionally so, in real life. The kicker is that the active dream world, the "Astral Plane" of the mystics, stands outside time and space. Just because Bob dreamt that Alice entered his dream and they interacted in a "real life" sort of way does not mean that they both had the same shared dream on _the same night_. Alice might remember having that dream ten years ago — or she may not have it for another twenty years. _Illuminatus!_ creators Bob Shea and Robert Anton Wilson described dreamspace as the _MorgensHeuteGesternewelt_ — the "tomorrow-today-yesterday world".

    Podcasts 

-   This is Rose's ability in _The Bright Sessions_.
-   The horrifying power of the main character in _The Magnus Archives_. At first it seems like his bad dreams are a reaction to trauma, but it is eventually revealed that they don't belong to him at all. When the Archivist takes a statement from a victim, he causes them to have constant nightmares of their own trauma, which he then enters in order to watch them suffer. Over and over and over. And here we thought that the Archivist's patron, the Ceaseless Watcher, was the fluffiest Eldritch Abomination in town.

    Roleplay 

-   In _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_, Zia can view other people's dream as a result of her telepathic powers. The downside being that it prevents her from getting a good night's sleep.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine_: Sosunov magic is focused around dreams, including the option of walking into one to communicate with people or defend them from Outside-spawned dream horrors. The Dream-Witch character is also capable of this, despite not being a Sosunov or, for that matter, human (technically speaking).
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: The 3.5th edition supplement book _Heroes of Horror_ supplies ideas and optional rules to create dream (or nightmare)-like sessions. This includes purposeful or accidental entry of a dreamworld from the waking world. It's only natural that it also features certain feats based on interpreting and entering the dreams of others, called Oneiromancery.
-   _In Nomine_: Angels of Blandine (Archangel of Dreams) and demons of Beleth (Demon Princess of Nightmares) do this as a matter of course. It's also possible for others to learn to do it.
-   _Pathfinder_: Dream and nightmare dragons, night hags and alebrijes can pass through the Material Plane, the Ethereal Plane and the Dimension of Dreams at will, entering and exiting dreaming minds as they please.
-   _Promethean: The Created_: One First Edition supplement introduced the rare "Dreamborn" Prometheans; rather than being made in the traditional way (i.e. digging up corpses and bringing them Back from the Dead) these Prometheans were instead created from people's _dreams_ of doing that, sometimes intentionally, sometimes by accident. They consequently have a Bestowment that allows them to enter the dreams of people nearby (whether they want to or not) and their Wasteland effect causes a plague of nightmares, with the Dreamborn Promethean as the boogeyman they all share. Unusually however, the Promethean can't _interact_ with the dream or dreamer at all, and is instead a powerless observer; Prometheans being what they are, they're denied _any_ connection with humanity, even on that basic level.

    Video Games 

-   Kaname Date, the protagonist of _AI: The Somnium Files_, is a detective who can use a special machine to "psync" with people, allowing him to see their dreams in order to extract clues from their subconscious. But given how dreams are, the information he gains this way can be somewhat unreliable.
-   The title character of _Alundra_, as well as Meia, has this as their main power and use it to free people from the nightmares created by various dream demons.
-   In _Animal Crossing: New Leaf_, this is implied to be an ability of your character as you can share your town and enter the towns of others via the Dream Suite. And these shared towns are explicitly stated to be dreams.
-   The Hunter of _Bloodborne_ is one, he travels across the land of Yharnam to seek a solution to halt the source of nightmare brought by the Great Ones.
-   _Da Capo_: Protagonist Jun'ichi has the ability to view other people's dreams when he sleeps. He doesn't like it much, saying that in practice, most people's dreams don't make any kind of sense, are often very boring, and the whole thing just leaves him not getting as much rest as he'd like. Also, it happens whether he wants it to or not.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   The Fade is where all races (barring the Dwarves) go when they sleep, though only Mages are capable of remaining self-aware whilst in the dreamworld. Because of this unique ability, they developed certain magical rituals involving lyrium, allowing them to enter the Fade whilst awake, enter another person's dreams, or allow them to release people from demonic possession, by attacking the demon at the source. Mages who attain full Dream Weaver status are known as "somniari" to the elves, though those are incredibly rare.
    -   _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ has Solas, an expert on the Fade who regularly visits it just to hang out with spirits. He doesn't appear to be a Somniari, but at one point has a lengthy conversation with the Inquisitor while they're both dreaming. Given his real identity, he might as well as one of the somniaris, the oldest and original ones in fact.
    -   _Physically_ entering the Fade, as opposed to lucid dreaming, is nigh-impossible without extremely potent magic such as the Eluvians or the Anchor.
-   Alice Drake, the heroine of _Dreamkiller_ has the ability to enter and exit dreams at will, and she uses her powers to infiltrate her clients' nightmares to purge them of their phobias by destroying the monsters inside their dreams.

-   _Elona_ has a wizard that can randomly show up in your character's dreams by accident. To make up for bothering you, he teaches you a random spell, including some potentially rare ones.
-   In _Farnham Fables_, the dreamgivers Ethrea and Althea are spirits who can travel into people's dreams. Althea the Nightmare mostly uses these abilities to Poke the Poodle, like in Episode 4 where her "evil plan" basically consists of making Theresa do a Fetch Quest. The ending of that episode also reveals that Ethrea can link people's dreams together, which she does to Andrew in order to put an end to Althea's mischief.
-   _Final Fantasy VII_ has a segment where Tifa dreamwalks inside Cloud's dream.
-   The playable character in _Hollow Knight_ gains the ability to enter dreams with a Dream Nail. For the most part this is merely used to invade the dreams of slain bosses so that you can fight stronger versions of them, but it is also a very plot important key ability used to enter the White Palace of the Pale King, which was transported into the realm of dreams and sealed within the void of a Kingsmould, as well as the dream of the titular Hollow Knight wherein you can confront the True Final Boss.
-   In _Kingdom Hearts 3D \[Dream Drop Distance\]_, Sora and Riku are tasked with diving into the dreams of sleeping _worlds_ to reawaken them. A late-game development also reveals that the Drop mechanic and the Dream Eater emblem on Riku's new outfit were because Riku had actually spent the whole game in _Sora_'s dreams.
-   _MARDEK_ had a dream reality in Chapter 3. It's not exactly walking through someone's mind, but it's shaped by human thoughts.
-   This is the main gameplay gimmick of _Mario & Luigi: Dream Team_. Pi'illo Island has many magical pillows on which Luigi can fall asleep, creating a portal to the Dream World that Mario can enter. It's not just Luigi's dreams you can enter either. If you fall asleep next to someone, you end up in the same Dream World as them. Hence how you get to enter Big Massif's dream in Wakeport and Bowser's Dream in the final dungeon.
-   Entering other characters' dreams is required at certain points in the _Neverwinter Nights 2_ expansion pack, _Mask of the Betrayer_. The shaman Gannayev-of-Dreams has this power innately, and One-of-Many can learn to do this, depending on the player's actions.
-   _Pathfinder: Kingmaker_: Used when Linzi, a bard who can send messages via dreams, and the Storyteller concoct a spell that allows her and the Player Character to enter the Big Bad's dreams.
-   In _Piglet's Big Game_, the titular Piglet has the ability to visit the dreams of other Hundred Acre Wood denizens while they're fast asleep through a magic telescope, and the goal of the game is to help his friends with their problems within their dreams and fending off Heffalumps and Woozles along the way.

    -   _Wild ARMs 3_ has The Saint who appears in the dreams of the leader of the Arc of Destiny, as well as the Dream Child from Shane's dreams. In reality, they're both the Dream Demon Beatrice, using her dream walking powers to manipulate people for her ultimate goal of creating a Filgaia where she could live in.
    -   In _Wild ARMs 4_, the seller of the Black Market is implied to be a dream demon, with one of the NPCs in the city receiving nightly visits in his dreams by someone who tells him to go buy stuff from the Black Market. This would certainly explain why the Black Market deals in levels rather than money.

    Webcomics

-   _Archipelago_ has a number of dream walkers:
    -   Prince Paollo is a highly skilled one as the crown prince of the Eastern Continent, where this and dream weaving is a very respected talent.
    -   Snow does this as well, by stealing Paollo's power. He uses it to induce nightmares in his enemies.

    -   If a Sburb player's dream body is dead, then any time they sleep, their consciousness travels to the Dreambubbles in the Furthest Ring. This shared dreamscape also doubles as the afterlife for Sburb players—from every parallel timeline in existence. That makes _a lot_ of folks capable of stepping into one's dreambubble.
    -   Wayward Vagabond is _not_ a Sburb player, so he gets normal dreams when he sleeps. Somehow, god-tier Vriska Serket was able to jump into one of his dreams and talk to him (in Morse code) anyway. It probably has something to do with Vriska's psychic mind-control powers.
-   _Lovely Lovecraft_: Anyone who enters the Dreamlands. Prominent examples include Carter, Howard, and Hildred.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: Incubus is able to do this. Unusually, it appears to be a power entirely unique to him and not caused by his Key or his training — it is simply something he can do. He uses it to drop in on Allison in her dreams and play the role of Evil Mentor to her.
-   _Legend of the Blue Diamond_: Dream Dwellers are wolves that go into the dreams of wolves near them. Briar is a Dream Dweller.
-   An example appears starting here in _The Mansion of E_, though it's not clear who exactly is doing the walking.

Later, in the video _Dora's 3rd Nighmare_, we see that some guys, including the Author Avatar, are giving Dora the same kind of nightmare on purpose. They use some kind of dream computer system, which ends up getting hacked by a demonic Big Bird.

Fortunately, with the help of Sultan's late father, who still haunts the palace, Iago and Abu learn that the only way to communicate to Aladdin and the others is to enter their dreams while they sleep.

-   Bill Cipher of _Gravity Falls_ is a two-dimensional inhabitant of a Void Between the Worlds called the Nightmare Realm, who interacts with the dimension Earth is located in by appearing in people's dreams. Whenever he appears before someone, the surroundings turn black and white, and when he leaves, people act like they've come out of a trance. When the Author first met him, it was while he was taking a nap after reading an incantation to summon Bill, and Bill shows up to harass him in his dreams several times after that. Worse still, Bill has Reality Warper powers within the dreamscape and may even inflict Demonic Possession on those who foolishly make a deal with him. Ironically, his ability to enter minds is also his greatest weakness, because if he enters a mind and it gets wiped at the same time, Bill is erased along with it.

In "For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils", Luna is shown as able not only to enter a pony's dream, but redirect it to help them learn An Aesop.
    -   "Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?" shows that Luna is capable of pulling an entire town into a Shared Dream. It's also shown that Luna created the Tantabus, a creature of shadow and nightmares to punish herself for her actions as Nightmare Moon.
-   In the _Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker_ short film, all dreams play out within the Dream World, which means that Dream Walkers can be involved with the affairs of other Dream Walkers. However, threats specific to one Dream Walker, such as Poet's Night Terror, can't be confronted by other Dream Walkers. The definition of a Dream Walker in the short film and the comics is different from here, treating a Dream Walker as a Guardian type Lucid Dreamer.
