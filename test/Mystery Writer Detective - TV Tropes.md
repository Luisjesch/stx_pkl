_"There are two kinds of folks who sit around thinking about how to kill people: psychopaths and mystery writers. I'm the kind that pays better."_

Simply put, a mystery writer who solves actual crimes. After all, who better to unravel all the twists and turns of a mystery than someone who creates them for a living? Possibly a result of Write What You Know.

In real life, police detectives do sometimes bring in civilian consultants to help bring new perspectives into an investigation.

One example of a mystery writer getting involved in an actual case is when Sir Arthur Conan Doyle became concerned that police had pinned the murder of Marion Gilchrist, a rich, old woman on the wrong person. A small-time thief, Oscar Slater, was caught selling a piece of her jewelry soon after her death, and he seemed to be a logical culprit. Doyle thought the case had to be more complicated than a burglary-gone-wrong. He worked on the case and found out that police had hidden evidence that could have implicated her family members. He managed to get Slater out of jail for murder, but the true killer was never identified.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Case Closed_: The protagonist's father, Yusaku Kudo, is a mystery writer who occasionally steps in to solve mysteries when his son is stumped.
-   The leads from _Kamen Tantei_ kind of subvert this. Yes, they're mystery writers who investigate mysteries. But the female lead, especially, is a "fairplay" mystery writer living in a world where ghosts, psychic powers, "all a dream" endings, and fictional characters come to life (including the title character) make it impossible to use logic and common sense to actually solve mysteries.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_: Kaye Daye, one of the Mystery Analysts of Gotham City.
-   Gabe Webb from _The Maze Agency_. Well, True Crime Writer to be accurate, but close enough.

    Film 

-   In the 1959 film version of _The Bat_, Cornelia is rewritten as a mystery writer renting the mansion for some inspiration, which she gets in spades.
-   In _Big Driver_, Tess decides to use her skills as an investigative writer to find out the reason behind what happened — if she was a random or targeted victim — and, especially if the latter, how best to use that information to her advantage.
-   A Double Subversion appears in _Dial M for Murder_. Mark Halliday, a crime author, manages to independently formulate Tony's murder plot _entirely by accident_. Rather than trying to solve the crime, Mark thinks of a story that Tony can tell the police to exonerate Margot, which just so happens to be exactly what transpired, approaching Tony with the idea under the assumption that Tony (who Mark thinks is innocent) will do anything to save his wife. However, Mark quickly realizes that his fabricated plan was what actually happened.
-   Paula from _The Ex-Mrs. Bradford_. Although she's not the best detective and needs the help of her husband, she's pretty good at finding great clues.
-   _Lady on a Train_: While in a train halted at a station, Nikki Collins witnesses a murder committed in a nearby building. When she goes to the police they think she's read one too many mystery novels. She then enlists popular mystery writer Wayne Morgan to help with her sleuthing.
-   In _The Mad Magician_, Alice Prentiss writes murder mysteries. When a murder happens in her own house, she sets out to solve it. She does a very creditable job and contributes at least as much to the solution of the crime as Lt. Bruce.
-   In _Ring of Fear_, Wallace calls in Mickey Spillane (playing himself) to investigate the sabotage at the circus because of his fame as a mystery writer.

    Literature

-   In Chris Ewan's _The Good Thiefs Guide_ series, Charlie Howard is a thief who solves murders who has written several mystery novels about Faulks, a thief who solves murders.
-   Harriet Vane from the _Lord Peter Wimsey novels_ is another example. Her first appearance is as a _suspect_, after her recent ex is killed by the same method she is researching for a story.
-   In the Michael Slade novel _Ripper_, a whole **bunch** of mystery writers gather for a Mystery Dinner event on an isolated island, and end up hunting — and being hunted by — a killer in their midst.

-   Ian Ludlow in the _Monk_ novel _Mr. Monk and the Two Assistants_ has a consulting contract with the LAPD, and turns out to have used his side gig to commit murders which he frames other people for, then writes novels based on them.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Temperance Brennan, from _Bones_. She writes mystery novels, and she also helps solve crime. Although her career as a forensic anthropologist is probably more important to her ability to solve crimes than her alleged skill as a writer.

-   McGee on _NCIS_ is a special agent, who wrote a best-selling novel... which he would have preferred his coworkers never knew existed. Once they know, however, it becomes useful; in one episode, he is able to use his fame to get into a club as part of an investigation, something the other agents wouldn't have been able to accomplish. He continues to write additional novels, one of which forms a plot in a different episode where one of his readers takes things a bit too seriously.
-   Maxwell Beckett (Edward Woodward) in _Over My Dead Body_. He's a former Scotland Yard researcher (although everyone seems to think he was an inspector) who became a mystery novelist, and at the beginning of the series is approached by a reporter who came to him for help after witnessing a murder through her window and because he was her favorite author. After they solve this mystery, they became fast friends and begin to work together as amateur sleuths to solve crimes.

-   Parodied in _Old Harry's Game_, when Satan summons the spirits of Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie to solve Edith's murder, but they turn out to be completely useless. Dame Agatha suggests her own plots, regardless of their relevance, and Sir Arthur keeps going on about ghosts and fairies.

-   Paul Temple from _Send For Paul Temple_, plus its various spin-off films, television series, novels, and comic strips.

    Video Games 

-   _AkaSeka_: Edogawa Ranpo is basically this trope personified. Not only is he a mystery writer who solves crimes, he is also _obsessed_ with solving them, to the point where he actively seeks out cases to solve, acts like a little kid being given candy when asked to investigate crimes, and whines when no mysteries are taking place.

    Web Original 

-   Reggie becomes this due to the number of murders he helps solve in _Where the Bears Are_.

    Real Life 

-   A Real Life partial example might be Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. From The Other Wiki: "Conan Doyle was also a fervent advocate of justice and personally investigated two closed cases, which led to two men being exonerated of the crimes of which they were accused." See here.
    -   Granted, Conan Doyle had actual forensic training, and he had been a detective and lecturer himself before writing the Sherlock Holmes stories.
