_"Sorry we're late, your Majesty, Carla and I were stacking over Gatwick — I had to come around three times before I'd made my final approach!"_

— **Hugh Dennis** (as **Nicholas Sarkozy, President of France**), _Mock the Week_

Maybe it's the lower air pressure. Maybe it's travelling at 500 mph. Maybe it's just a desire to do what few people have ever done. The complimentary wine probably plays a part. It's unclear, but sometimes people just like to have sex on aircraft. Usually in the toilet, which is not exactly the most romantic location on the planet (nor spacious on most airplanes), but is one of the few private places. Occasionally, however, the more bold will attempt it at their seats.

The Other Wiki has an article on this. It is worth noting that the airline company will probably sue you, since it's of questionable legality. There are, however, dedicated companies for this sort of thing (however, despite the name of the Trope, there is no actual "club" of this name). Realistically, given the layout of most modern-day airplanes, unless it is very late at night and everyone is asleep and no attendants are looking, it's difficult for two individuals to enter the same washroom at the same time without being noticed, much less exiting when the odds of someone waiting to go in is very high. And not to mention the flexibility it takes for even two people of normal body weight to even get into position to do the deed in an airplane bathroom.

For the stage beyond the Mile High Club, see Zero-G Spot. Compare Three-Way Sex in terms of sexual rubicons all men are supposed to aspire to.

There is also the 'Meter High Club' sometimes called 'Mile Post Club' for people who have had sex on trains; with sleeper services this is a lot more practical and legal, but also common place in the days of 'closed compartment' trains. However, these days sleeper trains are more and more of a rarity and coach style seating is replacing compartments, making the lavatory once more the last place one can... discuss Uganda...

-   Discussed in an episode of _The Friday Night Project_ sketch show. In an audience Q&A, a flight attendant asks special guests Girls Aloud if they've ever done it. They not only denied it, they found the idea strange, questioning why anyone would have sex inside a small bathroom on a plane.

    It was love at first sight, Romeo and Juliet  
    **Kate:** He looked pretty rich and I was down on m' luck  
    So I charged him a fortune for a flying fu...

-   Crops up a couple of times in _Ménage à 3_:
    -   In a guest strip (August 2 2010, between #333 and #334, NSFW), Dillon claims to have joined it— in the cockpit.
    -   Senna and Gary have sex on a private jet _en route_ to Paris (Strip #780, August 20th 2013, NSFW funnily enough). Gary asks if they've joined the club; the answer would be "yes". Although they're eventually interrupted, penetration had occurred, and although the aircraft was on its landing approach by then, they must have been at least a mile high when they started.
-   _Quantum Vibe_: While riding a Space Elevator, Bobinardi asks a female subordinate if she's considered joining the "thousand mile high club".

In The Rant, the author notes that she heard this joke a lot back when she lived in Denver herself.

    Western Animation 

-   In an episode of _American Dad!_, Stan and Francine are having sex in a bunch of different places.

Neither one of them figures out that it's a Sexual Euphemism.
-   In a Halloween episode of the _The Simpsons_, Kang and Kodos select Marge for their "cross-breeding program".
    
    "To put you at ease, we have recreated the most common spawning locations of your species. You may choose either: the back seat of a Camaro, an airplane bathroom, a friend's wedding, or the alley behind a porno theater."
    
-   In Episode 3 of _The Boys: Diabolical_, the Great Wide Wonder is revealed to have done a plane-less variant of this to two female students from Columbia University, taking them way up high for a "flying fuck". Unfortunately, high altitudes lead to extremely cold temperatures, resulting in the women freezing to death and possibly suffocating. Even worse, Wonder didn't care about how the cold would affect them as it was "part of the fun" for him, and apparently never bothered to retrieve their bodies from orbit.
    
    **Billy Butcher:** Thing is, it's a bit fucking cold way up there. And by the time they twigged that he didn't give a shit, that it was part of the fun for him... it was too late. As far as we know, they're still up there in orbit.
    

    Other 

-   There is a Fun T-Shirt that said "Million Mile High Club" and had a picture of astronauts having sex. It should be pointed out that the "highest" any astronaut has flown is roughly 300,000 miles, the distance to the Moon, and no woman has left Low Earth Orbit (700 miles), but "Three-Hundred-Thousand Mile High Club" just doesn't have the same ring to it.
