When in space, do as the cylons do.

_"A ménage-à-trois, baby! Two's company, three's a ménage!"_

Also known as a "ménage-à-trois"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  or a "threesome."

The most common forms of sex involve two people. Supposedly it feels pretty good. So what's the most obvious way to take this steamy dynamic and ramp it up? Add another person — preferably a sexy one.

This trope is most commonly used as a form of basic Fanservice, and — due to Male Gaze and Most Writers Are Male reasons — the third person in this scenario is usually a woman, and the important in-focus character is usually a man. Who these women are or why they're willing to get into a threesome is rarely considered important information. Oftentimes, both women won't even have Nominal Importance and will exist entirely to show off how manly the guy is for having a threesome. This aspect of the trope is shown in one recurring aspect of the sex act — it will sometimes start out with the two women making out for an extended period of time before eventually "inviting" the man to join in, conveniently shortly before we Fade to Black. Naturally, this form is very common in pornography.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

As a narrative tool, most dramatic tension is built in the lead-up to the act, with characters discussing how or why they want to do it. It can also be used to develop sexual tension during the act by having the male character do it with his girlfriend and a third party, only to discover that he kind of likes the third party _more_. Some audience members will be annoyed that his getting too much sex is supposed to count as a "problem." One common variation that turns the trope into a joke involves a man's girlfriend suggesting to him that they do a three-way, and he quickly and eagerly accepts, only to discover at the last minute that the third party is a dude. This puts him in the hilarious situation of either having a Gay Moment or admitting that he was being hypocritical in only wanting three-way-sex when it fulfilled _his_ fantasy.

Like any sex-related trope, Double Standards apply. If a woman acknowledges to have partaken or to desire the 2 males/1 female variation of this trope, expect people around her to view her with disgust or at least with suspicion because My Girl Is Not a Slut. In real life, the 2M/1F ménage-à-trois is just as common a fantasy among women as the 2F/1M is among men. And of course, there are also one-gender variants (FFF and MMM) to play around with, but they're mostly consigned to the Minority Show Ghetto.

The Super-Trope to Twin Threesome Fantasy. For specific examples of MFF, MFM and MMF variants, see A Threesome Is Hot.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  This is an easy way of raising the stakes in an Everybody Has Lots of Sex setting. Compare Mile-High Club in terms of sexual rubicons that all men are supposed to aspire to. If one member of the threesome is not participating, but just watching, that'll usually involve Sex in a Shared Room (although it often doesn't apply in threesomes due to consent issues).

If the sex is just one part of a three-way relationship, it's Polyamory. See One True Threesome for Shipping examples, and Threesome Subtext for implied examples.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_: Played for drama and fanservice in _"Uncanny Eighth Wonder no.2"_, in which Athena gets brainwashed by Blowjob. Clara and her girlfriend, Mei, double-team her with a pair of strap-ons until she finally climaxes hard enough to return to her senses.
-   When the group visits the lamia village in _Monster Musume_, multiple lamias proposition Kimihito for threesomes, foursomes, basically any level of group he wants, since lamias are All Women Are Lustful personified and there's only one other man in the whole town and his age means his stamina isn't what it used to be. Kimihito being Kimihito, he of course isn't interested.
-   In _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, Nodoka fantasizes about Three Way Sex (Saishoudoukin) between Negi, Yue, and herself. There's a Censor Box involved, but it doesn't obscure the fact that in the fantasy, all three are naked and Yue appears to be sitting on top of Negi. Much to the amusement of Chamo and Haruna.
    
    **Chamo:** "Saishoudoukin." Well... you sure know some hard words, young lady. I guess they don't call you a book lover for nothing."
    
    **Haruna:** "To have such an immoral and lewd plan coming out from _you_, what a surprise."
    
-   _Rosario + Vampire_: 11-year-old Cute Witch Yukari seems perfectly fine with having one of these with Moka and Tsukune. In fact, it's one of her main ambitions in life.
-   _Sailor Moon_: In the Makaiju Arc of the anime, Usagi fantasizes about Mamoru in both his guises (Tuxedo Kamen and Moonlight Knight), making this also Screw Yourself. Usagi didn't learn that Moonlight Knight was Mamoru's guise or better said — sort-of other self until the end of the Makaiju arc itself.
-   _Sekirei_: Matsu, after waking up one morning attempting to kiss Minato, accidently kisses Musubi instead, which neither were that bothered by. While Musubi did believe she kissed Minato at first Matsu told Minato she'd be very interested at the thought of having a threesome with the two.
-   Played for Laughs in _Servant × Service_. Though she was most likely joking, Kaoru mentions she wouldn't mind having a threesome with her brother Yutaka and his coworker Yamagami when Yutaka brings a drunk Yamagami in her apartment.

    Comic Books 

-   _Circles_: At one point in the '70s, Paulie + Arthur + John lived together and they were all in a close relationship.
-   Elves in _ElfQuest_ are bisexual and tend to open relationships. Stable trios include Pike/Skot/Krim, Scouter/Dewshine/Tyleet, Cutter/Leetah/Skywise, and temporarily Cutter/Nightfall/Redlance. Then there's Skywise/Vurdah/Ruffel/Maleen, particularly in _The Heart's Way_. The pre-battle orgy in Book 4 shows Skywise with at least 2 unnamed Go-Backs, and Nightfall and Redlance mixing it with another unnamed couple. In the Futurequest storyline it's suggested that Kullyn, Jink, and Tamia will enjoy a threesome at the end of the story, all having previously had twosomes with each other.
-   _Fine Print_: Lauren is shown having an explicit threesome with a man and woman during one of her many hookups.
-   _Omaha the Cat Dancer_ has two major incidents. The first was with Joanne initiating it partially to keep Chuck and Omaha entertained while she is hiding them from a murderous businessman's minions. The second was when Omaha and Chuck celebrate their first New Year's Eve party after reuniting after an extended break up. Specifically, Chuck had invited Omaha's boyfriend whom she met during that separation to the event and to show his appreciation for that guy's support of Omaha during that tough time, Chuck invites him to participate in a threesome and a fun time is had by all.
-   _Raptors_: After the Molina twins have captured Vicky, there's a threeway scene between Drago, Camilla, and Vicky, made rather uncomfortable because of the Twincest and Questionable Consent involved.
-   _Watchmen_ features one. Sort of. Briefly. The three involved are Silk Spectre II, Dr Manhattan, and ... Dr Manhattan, who has duplicated himself because he thought Laurie would enjoy it. There are _additional_ duplicates working in his lab at the same time, which really pisses her off because she thinks he's treating her like "something that needs to be done".
-   Colossus of _X-Men_ apparently had a threesome the first time he was in the Savage Land (chronicled in _X-Men: Vignettes_). During a later visit, one of the girls strongly hints that her son is _his_ son, but he's oblivious.
-   A recurring event in the _XXXenophile_ comics written by Phil Foglio:
    -   Four-way sex between a man and three dryads appears in the volume 2 story "Tree's A Crowd".

    -   Volume 6's "Wish Fulfillment" features the male genie dividing into a Mind Hive of three clones in order to better please his female human lover.
    -   Volume 7 has "Rule of Three", in which a Love Triangle between male human spacefarer Omar, his long-lost female human lover Trillby, and his alien lover Snixor is resolved courtesy of Snixor being a hermaphrodite and the three deciding that this makes a threeway relationship quite viable.
    -   Volume 8 opens with "Overly Familiar", in which a female witch, her male familiar (a cat turned human) and the witch's patron spirit Cernunnos have a threesome to cure her of the miscast Love Potion spell she applied to herself. The next story, "I Swing The Body Electric", has a cute Robot Girl getting it on with the six male members of her crew. Finally, "The Monster Under The Bed" has incestuous lesbian twins being sexually ravished — much to their pleasure — by an unseen male monster under their bedsheets.

    Fan Works 

-   _Advice and Trust_:
    -   Discussed, after Rei has been ordered to spend some more time with Shinji and Asuka (who, unbeknownst to anyone else at that point, are now an item). Asuka firmly vetoes the idea while Shinji protests that it genuinely hadn't occurred to him. Then we find out that Rei wouldn't say no if they offered either… Asuka's Unusual Euphemism for it, "The Israfael Special", went on to become a minor meme on the forums where A&T is posted.
    -   It's also implied during Asuka's birthday party that Kensuke had a threesome with his two girlfriends while on a camping trip.
-   Lelouch and his girlfriend Milly have "played with" other girls in _The Black Emperor_, sometimes together.
-   _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ fic _Bruises Fade Like Memories_ has the three Spider-Men trying this out for the first time before the two older variants have to leave. Since this arrangement is Peter 1's first time, the former two make sure their younger counterpart is as comfortable as possible.
-   In _Code Geass: The Prepared Rebellion_, Lelouch has a threesome with C.C. and Sayoko after the Battle of Saitama Ghetto.
-   _A Crown of Stars_: Discussed. During a sex ed talk, Rayana mentions Shinji and Asuka that in some alternate timelines they had a very happy three-ways relationship with Rei. However, Asuka declares she does not intend to share.
    
    **Rayana**: You’ve got a true innocent here, Asuka. Careful breaking him in. Hmm, would you like some of my helpful pamphlets?  
    **Asuka**: Wait, there are way too many legs in that picture…  
    **Rayana**: Just the right number for three people.  
    **Asuka**: …three?  
    **Rayana**: I wanted to be prepared for any questions you might have. After all, there was that one worldline where you, Shinji, and Rei-chan were in a very enthusiastic threesome, \[…\] You spent most nights together playing "who can wear out Shinji first?" Shinji never got much sleep, but never seemed to complain.
    
-   In the _Discworld_ of A.A. Pessimal, Miss Alice Band wakes up with two _very_ close friends following an evening spent drinking strong liquor and losing inhibitions. Alice, Dolores and Steffi have their night of drunken abandon in Clowning Is A Serious Business''.
-   In the _Lost Girl_/_Castle_ fic "Fae in Heat", when Bo travels to New York to find a Wereling, she suffers serious injuries in front of Castle and Beckett before she and Kenzi can kill it. After compelling the couple to take her to Castle's apartment, Bo takes it a step further and engages in a threesome with Castle and Beckett for Intimate Healing.
-   _From Bajor to the Black, Part II_: Eleya states that her roommate Jazz once brought home a girl _and_ a guy (which led Eleya to Need a Freaking Drink), and she refers to a Noodle Incident where she woke up with a hangover next to two Klingons with a cracked rib and "several bruises in embarrassing places".
-   Germany, Italy, and Japan undertook this towards the end of _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ fanfic _Gankona, Unnachgiebig, Unità_. Let's just say Prussia, Spain, and France _definitely_ enjoyed the sight.
-   Most _Hurog_ fanfics: Laying Foundations ends with an implied threesome, Human Magic has a more explicit one, all with Tisala, Ward, and Oreg, the fandoms OT3
-   One of Marisa's **many** sex jokes in _Imperfect Metamorphosis_ involves inviting Reisen to have a threesome with her and Reimu. Reimu is unamused.
    
    "We haven't even gotten the strap-on out yet. You're welcome to join in if you want, ze. Make it a party."
    
-   _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Tempest Rewrite_: The final chapter (not counting the epilogues) details the wedding night of Mina, Emma and Orlando; for the fic in general, sex scenes with exactly two people are in the minority.
-   _Linked in Life and Love_: One of the first things to happen is an (offscreen) lesbian fourway between the members of Team RWBY. Except two of the girls are sisters, so they definitely were not doing anything to each other. All four end up in a relationship together. It's lampshaded repeatedly throughout the story that even by the already strange standards of the world and culture, _starting_ a long-term relationship this way is just plain bizarre.
-   In _The Logia Brothers_, Luffy's first time was with both Nami and Nojiko, though it was downplayed as Nami and Nojiko didn't interact with each other for obvious reasons and instead take turns. When Mikita joins the crew, it becomes a more standard threeway.
-   _My Immortal_ has Ebony, Vampire and Draco have a threesome in Chapter 43. Plus Voldemort's past self.
-   _A New Hope (Danganronpa)_, being Hotter and Sexier than its canon material, includes some detailed sex scenes. This includes two three-ways: one with Makoto, Mukuro, and Hina, and later with Hajime, Chiaki, and Mikan.
-   _New Tamaran_:
    -   Supergirl's favorite way of satisfying her sex addiction is with Wonder Girl and whoever happens to be available.
    -   Bumblebee, Aqualad, and Speedy fully embrace being Friends with Benefits.
    -   On the villain side, Cheshire and Blackfire engage in threesomes with Scarecrow (who consents) and Red X (who doesn't).
    -   In the second chapter of the sequel _Justice Returns_, Raven awakens Robin/Nightwing, whose naked body is entangled with those of Starfire and Barbara Gordon.
-   _Superwomen of Eva 2: Lone Heir of Krypton_: In chapter 13's Omake Misato and Asuka are fighting over Shinji. When it is evident Asuka has the upper hand, Misato talks her into "sharing" him, hinting she knows "things" and she can teach them both. Asuka agrees, and she is about to kiss Shinji… when Pen Pen wakes him up from his dream. Shinji was **not** amused.
-   The Marvel Cinematic Universe fic "Tingle" features at least two major scenes involving a threesome with Peter Parker, Yelena Belova and Kate Bishop (Peter also observes that Polyamory has been on the rise since the Blip meant that people came back after a five-year gap to reunite with spouses who had married other people). While Peter is the least experienced, the women are always patient with him, to the extent that even when Yelena declares an interest in pegging Peter she affirms that she'll let him decide when he's ready for that.
-   In _To Undo it All_, Yoruichi manages to get Ichigo to admit that in the previous timeline, Ichigo's first time was a threesome. Unohana later deduces that Ichigo's partners were herself and Yoruichi, simply by noticing exactly how Ichigo would avoid the subject.
-   _Total Drama_:
    -   _The Legend of Total Drama Island_: Several PG-rated references:
        -   Downplayed when Cody meets Katie and Sadie and sizes them up as "threesome material".
        -   Cody occasionally discussed the trope with Noah. These discussions typically take the form of Cody invoking the trope in reference to Katie and Sadie, and Noah defying it. Noah disdains threesomes because, as he puts it, “any bird worth making out with in the first place would be worth my undivided attention”; so if offered two girls, he would rather make out with them one at a time.
    -   _Second Chance at Love_: While not full sexual intercourse, the tenth chapter ends with basically this, with it made crystal clear this will be happening more in the future.
    -   _Unbreakable Red Silken Thread_
        -   Ever since Heather fully embraced her bisexuality, she and Cody have been having threesomes with other ladies. These apparently started late in high school and continued into college. They are common enough to have made the couple minor celebrities on campus, with most characters knowing about them. They even have a series of rules in place. Cody doesn’t ask for threesomes or pick the girls. In exchange, Heather doesn’t go off on her own after girls, talks with Cody about her choices beforehand, and doesn’t try to manipulate girls into their bed.
        -   Lindsay and Tyler partake in this as well, although only on special occasions such as hollidays and birthdays.
-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: Since Salem really wants grandchildren, she tries to convince Cinder and Pyrrha to double-team her son Jaune. Except Cinder is basically Jaune's sister, and Pyrrha refuses to be a homewrecker because Jaune already has a girlfriend. Also, Jaune isn't there.
-   In _With This Ring_, Karon and Holly offer Paul the chance for a three-way in the Spring in Blume arc. He ultimately turns the offer down since there were too many unpredictable emotional variables and it could mess with her rehabilitation.
-   _Xtremly Scray_ has the Ebony Expy, Harry Potter, and Draco have a threesome _in limbo_ after they slit their wrists and die.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _1900_ features a bizarre two male, one woman variation where protagonists Olmo and Alfredo visit a prostitute who gives them simultaneous hand jobs, then suffers an epileptic seizure while in bed with them. Unlike most examples, this scene's used more to emphasize the difference in their characters (Olmo, the Working-Class Hero, expresses compassion towards the young woman while Alfredo, the Upper-Class Twit, belittles her, triggers her seizure by forcing her to drink alcohol, then leaves while she's recovering) than to provide titillation.
-   _À l'aventure_:
    -   Sophie has sex with both a man and woman whom she's seeing in a BDSM relationship.
    -   Sandrine, Mina and Sophie later have a threesome when hypnotized by Greg (with their consent) to experience the most intense sexual pleasure of their lives as well.
-   In _American Psycho_, Patrick has threesomes with call girls several times. Then, he usually tortures them to death.
-   _Black Mama, White Mama_: Ruben, a drug lord, has sex with two sisters (without any explicit stuff).
-   The most important Three-Way Sex scene in history came in 1966 film _Blowup_. Thomas the hip London fashion photographer has sex with two would-be models. Even though the film used a Sexy Discretion Shot cutaway after the clothes came off, the nudity cost the film any chance at approval under The Hays Code. In response, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the film anyway, and the Hays Code became a thing of the past, soon replaced by the MPAA rating system.
-   _Blue My Mind_: At least four men at a club get Mia to give them fellatio as she's clearly intoxicates. She fellates two before Gianna comes into the room and gets her away.
-   In _Chasing Amy_, Holden feels insecure that he has less sexual experience than his girlfriend Alyssa (Alyssa participated in a three-way with two men in High School, which saddled her with the unfortunate nickname "Fingercuffs" and convinced her to swear off men for a while), and things are awkward with his best friend Banky because of Banky's repressed feelings for Holden. To solve both problems at once, Holden proposes that the three of them all have sex together. Banky tentatively accepts, but Alyssa is insulted, and both relationships end.
-   Featured in _A Clockwork Orange_ where Alex brings home two girls he meets at the local record store. The entire scene is sped up and set to a synth rendition of the "William Tell Overture". The scene in the original book is decidedly less hot, seeing as the girls are _nine years old_.
-   Not actually seen in _Darling_, which came out one year before _Blowup_. What we do see is Diana and her lover Miles in the apartment, as Diana's former lover Robert comes by, only to leave in embarrassment. That's followed by shots that reveal an Asian woman in the bedroom of the apartment, in front of the mirror, dressed only in her underwear.
-   _Duck Butter_: Fourway, actually. Nima suggests Fay and Kathy, a couple Sergio knows, have group sex with them. Sergio is not happy with the idea, but goes along. When the four start kissing though, Nima starts getting uncomfortable, so she calls it off.
-   _Entre Nous (2021)_: Discussed when Simon asks if Elodie and Laetitia ever have threesomes. She's contemptuous, saying that's every straight man's fantasy, obviously suspecting he wants one with the two. Laetitia says they don't engage in them. Simon says he'd like one with Laetitia and some women other than Elodie (whom he dislikes). Laetitia shows no interest in this, but does end up having sex with him alone.
-   _The Girl From Monday_: Nobody wakes up to find Jack and Cecile having sex. Later the three of them are lying in bed together under the covers of his bed.
-   _The Guard_: Gerry has offscreen sex with two prostitutes who are both dressed as Gardai officers.
-   In _Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle_ it is explicitly offered by Freakshow and his wife. While they debate whether or not to accept, Freakshow offers to make it a Four Way, which causes them to flee in terror.
-   _Holly Slept Over_: Noel proposes this between Audra, Holly and himself after Pete suggests the idea. They agree, having sex offscreen with him and each other. He gets jealous though after they start kissing when he's not involved. Holly's been in them already more than once and says they did great when it's over.
-   _I Love You, Beth Cooper_: Beth's friends Cammy and Treece sleep with Rich near the end, leading him to decide he's possibly bisexual, not gay (they're disappointed as it was too fast).
-   In _Ken Park_, Peaches has a threesome with Shawn and Claude.
-   _Kiss of the Damned_: Maia has sex with a man and woman in the house.
-   _Love (2015)_: There's a very lengthy, explicit threesome as Marcus, Omi and Electra all have sex together.
-   In _Magic Mike_, Mike and his girlfriend Joanna have a three-way with a woman that they don't know. Later on in the movie, Joanna approaches him about a three-way with Brooke (it doesn't happen).
-   _Professor Marston and the Wonder Women_: William, Elizabeth and Olive, as a polyamorous trio, all have sex together multiple times.
-   _The Rapture_: Sharon, a swinger, has a threeway early on with a man and woman.
-   _Rough Night_: Blair reluctantly sleeps with Pietro and Lea, the horny neighbors, since she's very worried that their security cameras caught the homicide. Although she seems to enjoy it at the time, she's quite unhappy to learn it was All for Nothing afterward, because their cameras don't work.
-   _Safer at Home_: The double standard is played up when during a game of Never Have I Ever, Jen reveals to the rest of the group meeting online that she has had a threesome of the one girl, two guys variety. Her boyfriend is disturbed despite the fact that it was over ten years ago and as she points out, he has a past too. They get into a bad argument.
-   _Sex and Death 101_: Roderick has sex with Bambi and Thumper, a (supposedly lesbian) couple.
-   In _The Sex Monster_, Marty convinces his wife to have a threesome with another woman. Then she wants to have another one, except really more of a twosome.
-   _A Simple Favor_: Emily claims she and Sean engaged had this with his T.A. Beth, although he denies it later.
-   _Spring Breakers_:
    -   The Twins always have threesomes with girls together.
    -   Brit, Candy, and Alien all have sex together near the end of the film.
    -   Shortly after this, Big Arch is shown having sex with two women as well.
-   In _Star Trek Into Darkness_, Kirk gets a call from Starfleet while he's in the middle of a Twin Threesome Fantasy with a pair of Caitians. They're less than pleased.
-   _Sweetwater_: Josiah is seen about to engage in it with his wives.
-   _Undercover Heat_: Dirty Harriet police officer Cindy Hannen (Athena Massey) goes undercover in a high-class whorehouse to catch a murderer. She discovers the fake clients set up for her cannot be relied upon and when faced with real tricks decides to sew her "Wild oats" and enjoy a sexual adventure as a real prostitute, transforming from tomboy into Fair Cop via a Girliness Upgrade, essentially Becoming the Mask. Also played with when she does a roleplay as a (dominatrix-y) cop for one of her unwitting clients and indulges in a threesome with an attractive married couple.
-   _Virgin Territory_: Lorenzo is bathing when two nuns get in the tub with him and they have sex. Later on another pair come into his room for this too.
-   _The Voyeurs_: At one point, Sebastian's shown getting up from bed after having had sex with two models.
-   _Where the Truth Lies_: The catalyst for the film's plot is a threesome gone wrong. Vince and Maureen had sex, after which she did it with Lanny too. When the two were in the middle, Vince came on to Lanny, who rejected him. Maureen saw and realized Vince is really bisexual. She demanded money not to out him as a result, which would be a social death sentence since this was in the 50's. Their valet Reuben killed her later to prevent this as her demand was too high to be satisfied.
-   One of the selling points of _Wild Things_ was a threesome between Neve Campbell, Denise Richards, and Matt Dillon. (The others were Girl on Girl Is Hot and a surprisingly complex plot.)
-   The climax (heh) of the Mexican film _Y tu mamá también_ features such a scene between the female lead Luisa and the two male leads, Julio and Tenoch. It's actually important for the film's story, as it exposes the underlying attraction between both boys. At first, Julio and Tenoch focus their attention on the incredibly lovely Luisa, but as she kneels to the ground to pleasure them both, the camera focuses on Julio and Tennoch as they begin to passionately kiss. Notably, the threesome ends the friendship between both boys, as they can only manage an awkward silence after waking up next to each other and never speak to each other again, except for a chance meeting months later.
-   _Young & Wild_: Daniela fantasizes about having a threesome with her boyfriend Tomás and Antonia, a woman she also likes.

-   _Black Iris_ has an instance that manages to be plot-relevant. When Blythe, Laney, and Armin give in to their mutual Unresolved Sexual Tension, someone gets a picture of them and uses it for blackmail. It's the typical MFF/FMF variant, but slightly different here in that both girls are bisexual anyway, and have plenty of sex without Armin.
-   _The Change Room_: Shar often engages in these as part of her sex work, usually women with their boyfriends seeing her together.

    I can best describe the state I subsequently entered as one of unrelieved busy-ness. Boy, was I busy! I mean there was just so much to do. You go here and I'll go there- okay, now you go here and I'll go there- all right, now she goes down that way, while I head up this way, and you sort of half turn around on this...

-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: Either it's just a kinky Dornish thing, or an interest in threesomes runs in the Martell family.
    -   Oberyn Martell and Ellaria Sand — a couple — like to share. They're both bisexual. Once they get a whore for the third party, and another time Ellaria expresses interest in Oberyn marrying Cersei so the three of them could have threesomes.

    -   Tyene Sand (also Oberyn's daughter) and Arianne Martell (Oberyn's niece) had — or at least tried to have — a threesome with Drey Dalt when they were young.
-   The Star Wars Expanded Universe subverts this. In the _Dark Nest Trilogy_, Zekk and Jaina become part of a Hive Mind and have a lot of sex. Zekk realizes that adding Jaina's _other_ Love Interest, Jag would be… nice. Jag, upon finding that his romantic rival now had the same feelings for him as did his romantic interest, refused to comment.

    Live-Action TV 

-   An early episode of _The 100_ has Bellamy waking up in bed with two girls. Part of a general pattern of Bellamy getting laid a lot in Season 1, thanks to Power is Sexy and looking like Bob Morley.
-   _Angel_:
    -   In "Carpe Noctem", an old man has been trying to reclaim his youth by taking over the bodies of young, fit men from the gym across the street from his retirement home. The first of the men we see the old guy possess has apparently just been engaged in a threesome with two women, just before his body melts from the inside when the old man's spell wears off. It's later sort of subverted, however, when it's revealed that the women were actually prostitutes.
    -   In "The Girl in Question", in addition to reportedly having a herculean physique, the Immortal has the stamina of a racehorse, as Darla and Drusilla can attest. (To Spike and Angel's vast annoyance, as Darla and Dru never let them do it 'concurrently'.)
    -   Perhaps they asked the wrong girl—in the comics it's revealed that Buffy's favourite sexual fantasy involves a bondage threesome with Angel and Spike (while dressed in a Naughty Nurse Outfit), and in a later comic issue she reveals another sexual fantasy involving two different film characters played by Christian Bale.
-   _Avocado Toast_: Discussed when Elle jokingly suggests she, Jake and Molly have a threesome when she's learned Molly's parents an open marriage, saying this runs in the family. "Way too soon", replies Molly.
-   _Babylon 5_: Centauri are polygamous, and their \*ahem\* Exotic Equipment kind of makes it easier to have them all at once. In one episode where Londo gained the right to divorce two of his three wives, but was having trouble deciding which ones, two of them tried to persuade him with a threesome, but the third refused to participate. Later in the series finale, Emperor Cotto is introduced in bed with two women, responding to a messenger with an aggravated "Whaaattt?!"
-   Baltar is shown to have done it with a Number Three and a Number Six in _Battlestar Galactica_. Quite an achievement since he's basically their captive at that point. Oh, and both women, being Ridiculously Human Robots, are strong enough to effortlessly snap his spine if they wished to.
-   In _The Boys (2019)_, the superhero Queen Maeve deals with her girlfriend leaving her by grabbing two buff guys for a threesome (she's bisexual, but her corporate overlords at Vought are marketing her as a lesbian because it's "easier"). When her handler Ashley finds her in bed with them, she chastises Maeve for endangering her public image. Maeve is too upset to care.
-   _Brave New World_: Along with public orgies, threesomes appear to be common in New London (we see many happening). Lenina turns down an offer for one after she's grown discontented with her society's ways.
-   A season one episode of _Californication_ has Hank and Charlie having a rather messy one with a woman. The episode is titled, appropriately enough, _The Devil's Threesome_.
-   In _Coupling_, Patrick proposes a threesome to his girlfriend, and she's very eager, but he doesn't realise until he's already waiting naked for her that the third party she invited was, in fact, Jeff.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Captain Jack Harkness mentioned waking up with his erstwhile executioners the morning after they were supposed to well, execute him, and says they're a nice couple and they've stayed in touch. In _Torchwood_, he mentions having once been involved with a pair of twin acrobats.
    -   Also in _Torchwood_, one of the team Owen picks up a woman in a bar with an alien lust spray. Then her angry boyfriend shows up. Since this is _Torchwood_, Owen just sprays the boyfriend too and is implied to have had sex with both of them at once. (Technically, he sprays _himself_ with the stuff. Whether this makes it less rapey depends on whether it just makes him smell _really good,_ or actually impairs their judgment.)
-   An episode of _Dream On_ featured Martin dating a woman who wanted a threesome with him and his best friend Eddie. At the end of the episode, they decide to go through with it.
-   Subverted in _The Drew Carey Show_, when Drew and a lesbian both get the same woman's phone number at a wedding and both start dating her. Since the two got rather competitive over who got to have sex with her first, she proposes a threesome. Drew ends up accidentally falling asleep on the couch while the two women go upstairs to start without him. By the time he wakes up, they've both already left, having fallen in love and decided to take a trip across the country together. Neither of them is ever seen on the show again.
-   _Elite_ features a rare MFM threeway relationship between Carla, Christian, and Polo. They get multiple scenes of each of them making out with each other and getting down and dirty.
-   _Entourage_:
    -   Eric's girlfriend's best friend suggests they all do it. Her motivations are treated as suspect and are the first thing Eric brings up with his (male) friends. They conclude that what she _really_ wants is to have sex with Eric's girlfriend, and Eric being around is just a plausible excuse for her to suggest it. Though not considering this in itself to be a dealbreaker, Eric ultimately decides against the proposal. But when he offhandedly mentions to his girlfriend that he "didn't think you'd be into it", she insists that they _do_ do it, apparently interpreting Eric's statement as some sort of remark on her not being adventurous enough.
    -   When Turtle and Drama, after spending days trying to impress the same girl asks her to make a choice, she simply takes them both by the hand and leads them upstairs. Cue uncomfortable silence the next morning due to accidental "crossing of swords".
-   _Fellow Travelers_: Subverted. Hawk tries to draw Tim into a threesome with him and Craig, Hawk's boyfriend. Tim goes along reluctantly at first, but Hawk stops before Tim can fully join in.
-   _Friends_:
    -   In the episode "The One Where Ross and Rachel Take A Break", Chandler and Joey once thought they might end up having sex with the same woman. When Joey asked who would go where, Chandler suggested flipping a coin:
        
        **Joey:** Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?  
        **Chandler:** Well, if you don't know that I'm not sure I want to do this with you!
        
    -   Hilariously subverted in a hypothetical What Could Have Been episode, where Ross and Carol—still married—agree to have a threesome with Susan, who was then only a... _friend_ of Carol's. Ross, tossed aside during most of the act, finds out the hard way about his wife's homosexuality. He made and ate a sandwich halfway through. They didn't mind.
        
        **Ross:** You ever go to a party and think, "Would anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
        
    -   In the episode "The One with the Jellyfish", it was revealed that Phoebe was conceived from a threeway between her parents and the girl who ended up being her adoptive mother.
-   Pete and Dawn from _Gavin & Stacey_ attempt one with a guy they met off the internet to try and spice their relationship up. It doesn't work out.
-   _Gossip Girl_:
    
    -   In the third season an upcoming threesome was announced and created a lot of publicity. Reactions among the fans quickly went from excitement to boredom when it turned out that the threesome was between Dan, Vanessa and Olivia (guest star Hilary Duff). Two of the show's least popular characters together with a guest character few people cared about. The whole thing is generally considered one of the _least_ hot moments on the show.
    -   Chuck seems to have more than his fair share, and both Nate and Blair lecture Dan about the unwritten rules for the activity.
    
    **Nate**: Look man, I know things. I've been to Europe. Chuck Bass is my best friend. The third person is supposed to be a stranger.
    
-   _Hemlock Grove_: Roman and Peter have a spontaneous threesome with Miranda in season 2. They both feel weird about it the next morning, while she's just like "it's the 21st century, guys!".

-   _House of Cards (US)_: Frank, Claire and their secret service agent Meechum have a threesome together, and, surprisingly, it's triangular: Frank and Meechum are clearly having sex with each other (Frank's bisexuality had been set up in the previous season).
-   A major goal for Barney in _How I Met Your Mother_; he bought a wrestling-championship-style belt to be awarded in such an occasion. In one episode, he quotes the Bro Code's guidance on the matter: "No eye contact during a Devil's Threeway." (A Devil's Threeway being two men and one woman, implied to have happened between George Washington and Benjamin Franklin.) He also claims in another episode to "almost" have had a 4-way. In addition, Ted may or may not have scored one. He refuses to say, but it's strongly implied. Yes, this is a story he's telling to his kids.
-   _In From the Cold_: Anya tempts Su-Yin using a promise that she would have a threesome with him and Faina, which gets him to do lots of favors for her.
-   _In the Dark_: In Season 3, Murphy has one with Felix and another woman they meet while on the run, to cover up who they are partly but also as Sex for Solace on Murphy's part.
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_: A MMF variant occurs briefly with Louis, Lestat and Lily in the series premiere. Both men are nude while she's topless and is sandwiched between them, but their foreplay doesn't get very far because Lestat activates his vampire skills to make Lily fall asleep. After she dozes off, Louis and Lestat continue having sex on their own.
-   _Just Shoot Me!_:
    -   In "Two Girls for Every Boy", Maya and a lesbian model get revenge on Finch, who tried to hook them up, by pretending they're willing to have a threesome with him but only if he completes an insane list of impossible tasks before sundown. Throughout the day, Finch is able to get anything he wants from fellow men simply by mentioning that it will help him in this goal (a mounted policeman even gives him a ride on his horse). After he fails miserably, the crowd of men waiting to know if he had succeeded (where they all failed apparently) is disappointed when he shrugs and says no… cue a Slow Clap moment for his effort.
    -   In "The Two Faces of Finch, Part 2", Betsy seduces Finch by promising him a threesome. He becomes squicked out when he realizes that Elliott is the intended third person rather than another female.
    -   In "The Goodbye Girl" Finch manages to set Elliot up with two women.
-   _The Little Drummer Girl_: Helga invites Charlie for a threesome with her boyfriend the night before the mission, but Charlie declines.

-   In Season 7 of _Mad Men_, Don has one of these with Megan and one of her acting friends in California. It was Megan's idea.
-   _The Magicians_: Quentin, Margo, and Eliot have a threesome while "high" on emotion magic.
-   In _The Mists of Avalon_, Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot get into bed together so as to help her conceive. Both have sex with her, thinking perhaps Arthur is the one who's infertile, while he would be happy to have a child whom Lancelot fathered.
-   _Mohawk Girls_: Zoe has sex with two guys together for stress relief.
-   _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ featured a fake-documentary sketch about village idiots, centering on one Arthur Figgis (John Cleese). When the narrator asks "What about his relationships with women?" the scene cuts to Figgis in bed with two gorgeous and apparently naked women, saying, "I may be an idiot, but I'm not a fool."
-   In _Mr. Show_ after Lyle unsuccessfully asks out 2 of the female scientists living in the Biosphere with him (both of who have dates with other scientists), he asks the only female scientist left, who also has a date. He says there should be no one left<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . She reveals she's going to spend the night with the scientist who another woman had plans with.
    
    **Lyle**: …he's sleeping with Dr. Shaddock.  
    **Dr. Laura Balance**: I know. I'm joining them later for a threesome thing.  
    **Lyle**: But what about _me?!_  
    **Dr. Laura Balance**: It's a threesome.
    
-   As per its Everybody Has Lots of Sex notoriety, _Nip/Tuck_ seems to engage in this trope with a fair amount of regularity. Most of the time it's just Christian doing it because, you know, he's Christian (in fact, he did this so regularly that he's participated in both the twin variant _and_ the mother-daughter variant on separate occasions), but a couple of plot-focused examples stand out:
    -   Matt agrees to engage in these with his ex-girlfriend lesbian cheerleader and her also-a-cheerleader lover, who feels that her new girlfriend is getting turned off the relationship because she's "not getting enough cock". After a few weeks, the other girl ends up dumping her for Matt.
    -   Sean and Christian engage in one with a high-class call-girl. Notable for sounding like a subversion of the "one guy two girls" dynamic while actually being completely unlike most examples of the trope. It's not really a "threesome" so much as it is "they take turns mounting her".
-   On _The Office (US)_, Michael brags that Todd Packer had a three-way with two saleswomen they met in a bar. Considering how repulsive Todd Packer is onscreen, however, it could just be Michael telling tales. Or considering how naive Michael can be, the women might have been prostitutes.
-   _Pandora_: Atria exits the showers with a man, then a woman to Tom's dismay. Later, he's seen lying in bed with two women as well. It's only implied in both cases.
-   On _Passions_, Charity had a threesome with the two shirtless hunks she was dancing with at the ski lodge club.
-   In _Peep Show_ Jez had been planning to dump his scary girlfriend until she suggests doing a threesome. Though the third person is a stranger, it is someone who detests the whole idea and the event is implied to be pretty horrible.
-   _The Power (2023)_: Roxy has sex with Gabriel in "Just a Girl" and it turns out she'd also been with Becca, who's disappointed that they finished without her.
-   Happens a few times in _Queer as Folk (UK)_. The show being what it is, all of the participants were men.
-   The Double Standard attached to the trope is discussed in an episode of _Quincy, M.E._, as an analogy to the one attached to alcoholism (one of Quincy's female coworkers is alcoholic). (If a guy wakes up in bed with two women, he's awesome. If a woman wakes up in bed with two men, she's a slut.)
-   _Roswell, New Mexico_: Has an MMF variant with the love triangle of Michael/Alex/Maria having one after a traumatic incident. Instead of adding more drama to the fire it provides Alex and Michael with enough closure to move on from each other (at least for a short while), Maria and Alex with the assurance that nothing will come between their platonic love for each other and Michael and Maria with a fresh slate to build their relationship on.
-   _Scrubs_:
    -   Todd, when pressed, admits he's had a threesome. Normally he would flaunt information like this, but it wasn't the "cool kind." This was before his sexuality was revealed as "The Todd". In later seasons, he became involved with a pair of swingers.
    -   Elliot's old friend Melody claimed to have been in a threesome. When J.D. asks if it was 2 girls and a guy or a "Devil's Threesome", she answers "all girl". This causes every man in the room to slap a nearby table in a fit of horniness.
    -   When Turk and Carla told JD they had something to ask him (and it would mean a lot to them if he said yes), he got the mistaken impression they were suggesting a threesome.
        
        **JD:** _\[thinking\]_ Oh my god, _would_ I have a threesome with Turk and Carla? Well, it's certainly flattering and I don't think they'd tell anyone...  
        **Turk:** Will you be my best man?  
        **JD:** _\[disappointed\]_ Oh...
        
-   _Seinfeld_:
    -   In "The Switch", George comes up with an idea on how to successfully pull off the titular switch: the act of breaking up with a girl in order to date her roommate instead, an Impossible Task if there ever was one. The man proposes a "ménage-à-trois" with the roommate to his girlfriend, who becomes disgusted and breaks up with him. She later complains to the roommate, who outwardly expresses sympathy but is secretly flattered she was included. The man then calls their home during a time he knows the roommate will be there but his now ex-girlfriend won't, flirts with the roommate, and asks her out. The original girlfriend is still disgusted and wants nothing to do with the man, so she tells the roommate that if she wants to date that sick pervert so badly she can have him. Problem is, when Jerry tries it, both women are into the idea, which freaks _Jerry_ out enough for him to end the relationship.
        
        **Jerry:** I can't! I'm not an orgy guy!  
        **George:** Are you crazy?! This is like discovering plutonium _by accident_!!  
        **Jerry:** Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything! I'd have to dress different, I'd have to act different! I'd have to grow a moustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions. I'd need a new bedspread, new curtains. I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirdo lighting. I'd have to get new friends; I'd have to get orgy friends. No, I'm not ready for it.
        
    -   In another episode, George discovers that his girlfriend has a male roommate, which makes him uncomfortable (especially since he looks a lot like George). He convinces his girlfriend to make the roommate move out but then discovers that the velvet furniture he loved belonged to the roommate and would be leaving with him. He then tries to weasel out of the relationship entirely by proposing a "ménage-à-trois", hoping to disgust the girl and get her to break up with him. However, it turns out that the girl had already been discussing such a thing with the roommate beforehand and they're both delighted to find out George is into it too. Cue Big "NO!" from George.
-   _Sex and the City_:
    -   Charlotte's boyfriend expresses interest in a threesome and she goes for it, even though Samantha advises her that the only way a threesome is good is if you're the third party they bring in for it. It ends badly; her boyfriend is more interested in the other woman than with her.
    -   Samantha has been dating a guy for some time, and he asks for a threesome as a birthday present. Samantha is quite jealous, but he kicks the other girl out of bed when she calls him "Daddy" mid-sex.
    -   Samantha has been listening to her neighbours having sex Right Through the Wall and starts to join in from afar. They invite her to join in in person, but they're too unattractive for her.
    -   Samantha (noticing a trend here) is propositioned by two Gay Best Friends of hers since they want to find out what it's like to be with a woman. It doesn't end well, because they can't bring themselves to do anything.
    -   One time, Miranda contacts a couple online who are looking for a woman to join in a threesome. Miranda actually has no intention of going through with it, though; she's just looking for validation that she _could_ have one if she wanted to.
-   In an episode of _Special Unit 2_, a pair of Medusa sisters pick up men in clubs with the promise of a threesome and, when they're alone, they show their real "hair," petrifying the poor saps. O'Malley goes in undercover and is immediately approached by a pair of sisters offering the same proposition, followed by the Medusae doing the same. He is torn between the two pairs of sisters until one mentions that she's not wearing any panties, tipping the scales in her favor. Incidentally, she is a Medusa. He's been hunting Links for a long time now, so they don't catch him off-guard, although he probably would've rather gone with the other sisters, who actually meant what they said.
-   The whole point of _Threesome_ is that Mitch, Alice, and Richie have a threesome in the pilot.
-   _Trigonometry_: Episode 5 reveals that Gemma, Kieran and Ray had one, as they all wake up naked in bed together. This was spontaneous after a long buildup of desire between them all.
-   _Two and a Half Men_:
    
    -   After Alan and Charlie meet several members of a women's volleyball team in a bar:
    
    **Charlie:** Come on Alan! Get your priorities straight!  
    **Alan:** I do have my priorities straight! I've had a wife for eleven years, but I've never had group sex!  
    **Charlie:** Don't bother; it's an overrated male fantasy.  
    **Alan:** Really?  
    **Charlie:** No, are you kidding?!
    
    -   Jake is implied to have a pair of girlfriends for this purpose in at least one episode.
    -   Alan later breaks up with a girl because their sex life was boring, just moments before she could reveal that she agreed and had invited her hot friend over to help spice it up.
-   _The Vampire Diaries_:
    -   Rebekah/Damon/Sage in season 3; as part of Damon and Sage's plan to read Rebekah's mind, they invite her over in a situation that looks very three-somey, though Sage is ultimately sidelined.

-   In _Vikings_, Ragnar and Lagertha offered to share their bed with Athelstan (who declined since he was a monk).
-   _Why Women Kill_: Taylor, Eli and Jade have a threesome together. Later, they meet another couple who Jade had sex with in a bar.
-   In _The Wire_, Jimmy McNulty has a threesome with two prostitutes while he is undercover during a bust. He ends up justifying it as, "I was outnumbered." and has to write a report on why he did it, as obviously he wasn't meant to "close the deal" before the raid. Bunk warns him that his report will make him a Baltimore PD legend. Sure enough, in season 5, Dozerman brings it up and McNulty only partially denies it.
-   _You Me Her_: Jack, Emma and Izzy decide to have a threesome, though first they do some research on just how it works (they watch some porn but find it unrealistic). They all manage to improvise and have an enjoyable time (before they're interrupted anyway), but they resume it soon. After this they continue having threesomes together, with their relationship growing into polyamory.

    Music 

-   The Britney Spears song "3" is about threesomes.
-   Katy Perry's "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)":
    
    Last Friday night  
    We went streaking in the park  
    Skinny dipping in the dark  
    Then had a ménage à trois
    
-   Beck's song "Debra" is about a man trying to woo a girl named Jenny, where he says:
    
    I wanna get with you  
    Girl, and your sister  
    I think her name's Debra
    
-   "Triad" by David Crosby.
-   Marilyn Manson's "(s)AINT" video cuts right to the chase, with Manson engaging in an _all-male threesome_ with two cross-dressing male hookers — portrayed by his ex-bandmate, Gidget Gein, and Eric Szmanda of _CSI_.
-   Two-thirds of "Surf City" by Jan and Dean are all about this trope. The Go-Gos replaced the line "Two girls for every boy" with "Two boys for every girl" in their cover version of the song.
-   "Wild Streak" by Hank Williams Jr.:
    
    Wild Streak  
    I want to jump in the sea  
    With two hot mamas and  
    Get it on
    
-   "Two For The Price Of One" by ABBA
-   "The French Song" by Joan Jett.
-   "I Got It From Agnes" by Tom Lehrer:
    
    Pierre gave it to Sheila

    He got it from Francois and Jacques  
    Haha, Lucky Pierre
    
-   A rare 2M/1F version in "Ménage" by Black Sheep featuring Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest. By the end of the song, it turns into a 3M/1F four-way.
-   Starting at the 1:52 mark in her video for "Hangin' In", Tanya Tucker hooks up with 3 muscular, bare-chested hunks for a 3M/1F four-way.
-   "3-Way (The Golden Rule)" by The Lonely Island is about this. The eponymous golden rule is: It's not gay when it's in a threeway. But being a comedy song, it doesn't really mean that.
    
    _It's okay when it's in a 3-way  
    It's not gay when it's in a 3-way  
    With a honey in the middle, there's some leeway  
    The area's grey in a 1-2-3-way  
    Normally, I don't get down with dudes  
    But tonight is a special exception  
    (Great!)  
    See, you're my best friend through thick and thin  
    Now it's time to make a triple connection  
    (Lights off)  
    Here in the dark  
    (Here in the dark)  
    It's hard to tell  
    (So hard to tell)  
    Where her body ends  
    (La lala)  
    And my homie's begins…_
    
-   "Culture Shock" by Olivia Newton-John.

    Theatre 

-   In the musical _Cabaret_, one of the musical numbers presented in the cabaret was "Two Ladies" including the master of ceremonies and two ladies in bed.
-   In A Slenderman Musical, there are multiple instances where two people in the same body do sexual acts with another individual or discuss the logistics of doing so. Add that to Samuel and Jordan's three-way with the Slenderman, and this trope becomes an important plot point.

    Video Games 

-   In the opening cutscene of _Dm C Devil May Cry_, Dante brings two strippers from a club in his trailer. This is a departure from his original iteration who's a Celibate Hero.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   In _Dragon Age: Origins_ it is possible to have a threesome (or _foursome_) with pirate queen Isabela under a few circumstances: if a female warden is romancing a hardened (that is, more cynical and selfish) Alistair, she can proposition Isabela for sex and invite Alistair along. If a male or female warden is romancing a hardened Leliana and propositions Isabela for sex, Leliana will insist on joining you to "keep an eye on things". If a male or female warden propositions Isabela for sex under any situation and Zevran is present, Isabela will invite him to join you; this can result in a warden + Isabela + Zevran threesome, or a warden + Isabela + Leliana +Zevran foursome (but not a foursome with Alistair—he will refuse).
    -   In the dwarf noble starter area, it is possible for a male dwarf noble to sleep with two "noble-hunters". They insist on taking turns instead of any "three-to-a-bed", though.
    -   In _Dragon Age II_, there is a possible threesome, also involving Isabela: at the resolution of Zevran's sidequest, Isabela will proposition him for sex. If Hawke protests, she will tell him or her, "You can come too."
-   In _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_, the Dunmeri Tribunal (a trio of Physical Gods) engage in this with each other, according to Vivec's _36 Lessons_ series. (Though sex amongst gods likely isn't as we mortals understand it.)
-   In _Fire Emblem Fates_, if Niles is called up to an Avatar of either gender's room for "bonding" _and_ said Avatar's spouse is there, he can imply that he'd be up for this:
    
    "If you two don't have anything planned for tonight, I can think of a few suggestions."
    
-   In the _God of War_ games, Kratos can have a threesome in each. In addition, Aphrodite in _God of War III_ is busy with two slave girls when Kratos arrives, and invites him to join (but then a foursome is averted when the other two ladies are relegated to the sidelines, providing commentary on the player's skill with Aphrodite in the following Quicktime event).
-   Difficult but possible: In _Jade Empire_, it is possible to have sex with Silk Fox and Dawn Star at the same time if you have high enough persuasion skills and are male, or Silk Fox and Sky for either gender.
-   Subverted in _Mass Effect_. If you flirt with both Liara and the human squad mate they will eventually confront you. Shepard can suggest a three-way, however Kaidan and Ashley won't agree and will break off the relationship.
    
    **Shepard:** "I love it when women fight over me."
    
-   _Summertime Saga_: A few of the sexual scenarios involve three-ways, including Odette and Grace, and Debbie and Diane. There's even a four-way with Roxxy, Becca, and Missy.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Double Homework_: The MC ends up in a polyamorous relationship with his twin sisters, including threesomes.
-   _The Eden of Grisaia_: Makina and Sachi ambush Yuuji, tie him up and have their way with him.
-   The Nasuverse uses Deus Sex Machina and Intimate Healing more than once, so this trope tends to take place sometimes:
    -   In _Tsukihime_ fan-disk _Kagetsu Tohya_ is the unlockable side story 'Flower of Thanatos', where Shiki can have a passionate threesome with maid twin sisters Hisui and Kohaku.
    -   In _Fate/stay night_, the first erotic scene in the _Fate_ route is between Shirou + Arthuria/Saber + Rin. _(With Saber in the middle, even.)_
    -   Fan-disk _Fate/hollow ataraxia_ has a gorgeous hot dream scene between Shirou, Sakura, and Medusa/Rider.
-   Played for absolutely _horrifying_ Fan Disservice in _Saya no Uta_, where Fuminori and Saya _rape_ Yoh.
-   The _School Days_ franchise has its share of this tope too:
    -   The player can make Makoto score a threesome with _both_ Kotonoha and Sekai either in on the rooftop of the school or in Sekai's own bedroom. If they do well enough in the game, the three stay together in a Polyamory relationship.
    -   _Summer Days_ adds threesomes with twin sisters (Kazuha and Futaba), two regular sisters (Otome and Karen), and mother and daughter (Youko and Sekai).
    -   Subverted in _Cross Days_, where Makoto can convince Hikari, Nanami _and_ Roka to gather for sex, but they don't engage in _actual_ three-or-four-way action. First Makoto does Hikari while Roka talks to Nanami and then fingers her to orgasm, then Makoto fucks Nanami while Hikari and Roka chat and watch over them.
    -   Played "straight" in the route with Makoto, Taisuke and Yuu/ki.
-   _Shale Hill Secrets_: In Episode 7, the MC can end up in a threesome with Maggie and Halley, who are revealed to be bisexual and had been on the verge of becoming lovers when they were teenagers.

    Web Comics 

-   _Kimchi Cuddles_: Baxter, Soliloquy, and Lilly try to have one, but Baxter drops the ball. He's not good at multitasking.
-   _Least I Could Do_:
    -   Rayne ends up sleeping with another guy in addition to the girl he tried to pick up. He's not too happy about the dude, but they're a "package deal" and he's apparently just heteroflexible enough to handle it.
    -   A small storyline centers around him trying to get a threesome with two girls going. It would have succeeded, but he pushed his luck in trying to make it a fivesome. Impersonating a police officer probably didn't help much either.
-   Shows up often in _Ménage à 3_, though maybe not _quite_ as often as the title makes some people expect, with most gender permutations. Some examples:
    -   Flashbacks shows Zii's foursome with (male) triplets (exhausting) and her threesome with two male former band-mates (abortive due to male-male hang-ups). Another flashback shows Zii's abortive attempt to organize a surprise six-way orgy for Yuki, which ran into the problem of the latter's phobias.
    -   Zii gets a threesome with Sonya and Jake. The night ends badly, but no one is objecting at the start—and Jake subsequently develops an excessive taste for (mostly off-screen) group sex.
    -   Matt manages to bag two cast members (one male, one female) from Dillon's play, simultaneously.
    -   Nathan organises an encounter between himself, Amber, and Dillon (in drag), though he mainly just watches.
    -   Zii gets Erik and Adrien into bed simultaneously, the first night that they all meet.
    -   Amber offers Gary a threesome, and he fantasises about her and Chanelle. Unfortunately, she means with her and Dillon, which isn't to Gary's tastes, so that fantasy quickly ends. He does get his fantasy realized and expanded later, though.
    -   Yuki and Sonya's "sex contest" for Gary's favours culminates in a (pre-arranged) three-way encounter, which ends in disaster (unless you count Gary having sex with Kiley as an indirect consequence), as Gary for one should have expected, when Yuki's issues kick in, again.
    -   Zii, Sonya, DiDi, and Peggy wind up in what has to be called a lesbian orgy, though that's mostly about two pairs at any given moment.
    -   Matt arranges a foursome with Gary, Kiley, and Peggy, for complex reasons of his own which he doesn't fully disclose to the others. As a result, when Kiley discovers what's going on, she storms out. However, the others all stick around, so it reduces to a threesome.
    -   Kiley offers Sonya and Yuki therapeutic assistance with their mutual problems. Given how Kiley is approaching this, and the nature of those problems, these sessions may end up looking a lot like lesbian threesomes.
    -   In one of the last story arcs of the comic, Peggy proposes a threesome with two of her co-workers, Jane and Vince, who are both extremely attracted to her. However, the two are such Platonic Life-Partners that they are both Squicked by the idea of merely seeing each other naked, much less doing anything sexual with each other. Peggy says it's either that or nothing, so they down sufficent Liquid Courage to make the experience bearable and reluctantly agree to it, since they both _really_ want to sleep with her. When they get back to Peggy's house, she leaves to go get some "equipment" and leaves the two soused paramedics in her bedroom alone together. She's gone less than a minute, but by the time she comes back, the two of them have skipped from Platonic Life-Partners straight to passionate lovemaking and declaring their desire to move in with each other and have babies, and completely ignore Peggy, whose metaphorical boner is killed on the spot watching the spectacle.
-   Dora from _Questionable Content_ gives her opinion on the subject.

    -   When Steg and Suria get stranded in the desert in Track 6, one of the ways they pass the time is taking turns suggesting potentials thirds for a threesome, bringing up characters like Redd, Blue, Elizabeth, and even Billy. This turns out to be foreshadowing for Track 8, where they invite Dakota to join the two of them. Dakota is ultimately too shy and self-conscious to get intimate with Steg and Suria, but the three end up in a compromise where Dakota watches the two of them and brings himself to climax.
-   In _Schlock Mercenary_, the husband of a woman who was "gate-cloned" suggests this. The two women are of one mind in their disagreement with the idea.

-   _Rick and Morty_:
    -   In "Mort Dinner Rick Andre", Rick's nemesis Mr. Nimbus notices Beth's and Jerry's "sex-positive" vibes and invites them to have a threesome with him. They're cautiously interested, especially when they each think the other really wants to give it a go, but admit to each other in The Stinger after they arrive for it that they were really doing it more for each other than themselves, and decide to head home...only for Mr. Nimbus to let them in and reveal that he's _quite_ well-endowed, at which point, Jerry and Beth are quite happy to partake.
    -   In "Bethic Twinstinct", Earth Beth and Space Beth start an affair behind Jerry's back. When he finds out and later confronts them about it at the end of the episode, he tells them that his biggest issue was really just them keeping it a secret from him (which Earth Beth admits was wrong) and he's okay with it if it makes her happy, which quickly leads to the Beths getting it on right in front of him while he encourages it. This ends up being a big turn-on for all three of them, and while the audience (and Rick, Summer and Morty) can only hear and not see what happens next, it's heavily implied to turn into a threesome soon after.
