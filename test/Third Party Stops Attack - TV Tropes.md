This trope is about an action, in which someone interrupts someone else's attack meant for a third party. The attacker, the attacked and the interrupter can be a bad guy, good guy or neutral, and they may or may not have relation to each other. The interrupter may be a Threatening Mediator.

Ways of accomplishing this include:

-   The interrupter disables the attacker's means of attacking (such as holding off the attacker's limb before the latter managed to punch/kick the would-be victim) or paralyzing them entirely.
-   The interrupter defends the would-be victim against the attacker's attack, be it close or ranged. The defending move may be as simple as blocking/parrying the attack, to the more complex ones such as shooting a flying bullet away or casting a protective spell on the would-be victim.
-   The interrupter assaults the attacker before the latter manage to harm the would-be victim.

Compare Diving Save, when the third party instead moves the would-be victim out of harm's way, and Taking the Bullet or Tuck and Cover, when the third party absorbs the attack themselves. Also see Thwarted Coup de Grâce and Conveniently Timed Attack from Behind. For a variation where no physical action is taken to stop the fight, see Battle-Interrupting Shout.
