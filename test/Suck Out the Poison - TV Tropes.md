_Now if a snake should bite you, don't you worry, fret or shout  
Just call my name and I'll be there and I'll suck the poison out  
"But what if I should sit on one and it gets me in the end?"  
She said "That's when you'll find out, that I'm a real true friend."_

Alice and Bob trek through a desert. Bob unwittingly steps on a snake - and, unfortunately for him, it's venomous. Immediately, Alice starts sucking out the poison to buy him some time before they find real aid...

**Do Not Try This at Home.** This used to be taught up until recently-ish, but as it turns out, A) All the bacteria in your mouth could cause an infection in the wounded person; B) Sucking out of a thin puncture will only make the area swell, and C) You're too late - the moment a person's heart beats after a bite, the venom is already circulating around their body anyway.

Note that this trope, like most snake-bite "cures", became popular because it _seems_ to work. This is helped by the fact that people survive the vast majority of venomous snake bites even without treatment, and a large proportion of snakebites are 'dry', meaning the snake releases no venom anyway. So, someone gets bitten, someone else 'sucks out the venom' (even though there is no venom), and the person gets better (simply because most people do), and both parties become convinced that sucking out the venom works!

In reality, the currently advised First Aid for snakebites is to keep the victim calm, prevent them from moving, and arrange for them to be transported to the hospital. In Australia, a country packed with things that can and will bite or sting you at a moment's notice, pressure immobilisation bandages are also recommended.

May be used as a form of Intimate Healing. Similar to Kiss of Life, as both require pressing one's lips to an injured party's body, but since _any_ part of the body can be poisoned, it's as likely to be gross or funny as sexy. A subtrope of Worst Aid.

    Advertising 

-   Rowan Atkinson did a series of Barclaycard adverts in the 1990s where he played an incompetent spy (later used as the basis for his Johnny English character) whose assistant would call Barclaycard to get them out of sticky situations. In one ad, they are stranded in the jungle with a comrade who has been bitten by a snake. The assistant wants to call Barclaycard's international rescue service, but Atkinson ridicules this idea and suggests they suck out the poison - until he discovers the wound is in a rather sensitive place and agrees to call for help. Given the "buzzing flies" sound we hear, the wound might also have turned gangrenous.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Bastard!! (1988)_ has Dark Schneider take a blow from a poisoned sword while protecting a love interest, and then tells her she'll have to suck out the poison.

-   During the Angel Fall arc of _A Certain Magical Index_, Touma falls comatose from a wound inflicted by a poisonous blade wielded by the serial killer Jinsaku Hino.

-   _Change 123_: Played With in Chapter 29, with the location of the bite makes this covered by Rule of Funny. Kosukegawa is seemingly bitten in the crotch by a viper and passes out. Panicked, Tsukishima, Fujiko, and Hino strip off his shorts in order to suck the poison... but then they notice he doesn't have any bite marks and that the viper actually missed him since he's so small, it only managed to bite his shorts and he has only passed out due to shock. He wakes up moments later, pantless with all three girls staring at his crotch and commenting on his Teeny Weenie, prompting him to have a Naked Freak-Out.
-   Done in _Cross Ange_ by Tusk to save Ange's life from a venomous snake. Worth noting is that Ange was still running in the rain after she was bitten and was still quite a ways when she found Tusk, who's still tied to a tree thanks to her. Worse for Tusk, though, the snake bit Ange on the thigh near her crotch, damned if he did, damned if he didn't.
-   Kyu does this to Megumi in _Detective School Q_ when they're trapped in a sealed room and a Meiousei member releases a snake that bites her on the leg. Subverted because, even with that treatment done, Megu _still_ needs to get an injection of the appropriate antivenom and treatment in the hospital before she fully recovers.
-   The vampire-like Arystar Krory from _D.Gray-Man_ can remove Akuma poison from another person by drinking their blood.

-   _Eiken_ has this in one chapter with Densuke and the resident ill girl going on a date in the woods and her getting bitten by a snake. Because it is unclear to them if the snake is venomous or not, she insists that he suck out the potential venom, which he is reluctant to do, since it bit her in the butt.
-   Chiyo does this for Yuu in _The Elder Sister-like One_ in order to suck out the mosquito saliva from his bug bites (she's an Outer God, so she can actually do that). It backfires when she gets to a bite that he already treated, causing her to get a mouthful of foul-tasting medicine.
-   Done in the _Fushigi Yuugi_ OAV, when Miaka sucks poison out of Tasuki's wound. She takes this one step further, in that she attempts to cure Tamahome of a monster possession by sucking the monster out of the bite wound used to make it enter his body.
-   Gon tries this in an early _Hunter × Hunter_ chapter. It doesn't work.
-   Myoga the flea from _Inuyasha_ do this a few times:
    -   Early in the story, Myoga sucks the poison from Human!Inuyasha when he was poisoned by a youkai. Myoga grew to almost the size of Shippo and passed out. Although Inuyasha didn't need to fully recover. He just needed to last out the night until he regained his Healing Factor.
    -   Later, Myoga did the same thing to the entire main cast (except Inuyasha, who didn't need it).
-   Done by Kyosuke to Madoka, who was bitten by a snake, in _Kimagure Orange Road_.
-   In _Lord Marksman and Vanadis_, Tigre has to suck out the poison from Limlisha when an assassin's snake bit her. Where did the snake bite her? Well...
-   _Monster Musume_:
    -   Used when Kimihito is forced to suck experimental fertilizer out of a rampaging dryad. Since she's a Plant Person that stores fluids in her breasts, this works.
    -   In a later chapter Cerea is stung by an Asian giant hornet, Kimihito offers to suck out the poison (complete with a commentary box Lampshading that this doesn't actually work). Where was she stung? Her nipple, of course. In the next chapter, she admitted that she was never actually in any danger from the sting, she was just using it as an excuse to get intimate with him.
-   Averted in the Zabuza Arc of _Naruto_. When Naruto takes a poisoned weapon to the back of the hand, Kakashi instructs him to open the wound and let out the poisoned blood from his system. This was pretty hardcore until he is then reminded to stop the bleeding before he bleeds to death. Admittedly, using a _kunai_ to slice open your bloodstream carries a very significant risk of causing the wound to become septic. But they're ninjas, and he has a Healing Factor (though at the time neither he nor his teammates knew about that last bit).
-   Pictured above: _Ninja Scroll_: Jubei attempts this after Kagero was bitten by a venomous snake, but she quickly stops him by kneeing him and explains she has her own toxin in her body that'll negate the poison...and would've killed Jubei if he had actually managed to start sucking.
-   Subverted in _One Piece_.
    -   During the Impel Down arc, various characters are afflicted by the cocktail of poisons produced by Warden Magellan's devil fruit powers. Most of the survivors simply received an antidote the prison keeps on hand. Luffy, on the other hand, was injected with hormones generated by Ivankov's fruit, intented to aid Luffy's immune system in fighting off the effects of the poison.
    -   During the Whole Cake Island arc, Luffy eats the skin of a fish so poisonous it kills most people instantly. ue to his encounter with Magellan's poisons, Luffy's body is able to produce enough antibodies to keep him just barely alive. Reiju is able to suck out the poison, but this is because everyone in her family has some kind of genetic enhancement that grants supernatural powers. In Reiju's case, she is not only immune to poison, but able to injest it, allowing her to drain all of the poison from Luffy.
-   San's introduction in _Princess Mononoke_ shows her attempting this on Moro. It doesn't work because the iron bullet poisoning Moro is never removed.
-   Attempted in awkward places by Kiyoshi and Mari in Ecchi manga _Prison School_, resulting in them ending up in what is referred to as the "Uroboros" stance. Used with a twist however in that the snakes were never actually venomous, having been put there by Big Bad Keito to invoke this trope for blackmail purposes.
-   Subverted in _Rurouni Kenshin_. Yahiko was once poisoned, and when Kaoru was about to try this, Megumi (who is a doctor/pharmacist) stopped her and said that would just complicate the injury. She then makes an actual antidote.
-   A bonus _Slayers_ Yonkoma strip parodies this: after Lina is bitten by a venomous snake, Gourry volunteers to suck out the poison, much to her embarrassment. He swallows. He spends the next week bedridden.
-   Some kind of essence of evil poison in the episode of _Wedding Peach_ where Limone reveals his past with Yuri.
-   Done by Hiraga to Roberto in _Vatican Miracle Examiner_ when the two priests are visiting Africa, in a rather homoerotic way, which involved sucking noises and Roberto moaning Hiraga's name.
-   _Why the Hell Are You Here, Teacher!?_:
    -   Ichiro attempts this on Kana when she gets bitten while swimming at the beach, in the worst possible spot. She passes out, but not because she was poisoned, but because he hit the wrong spot.

-   In _Revelations_, at the end of chapter 11, Túrante sucks out the venom from Aragorn. Túrante the vampire is the only character who can do this.

The team is thinking, and finally they give the answer "The man should try to get to the nearest village, and there, to ask someone to suck the venom out." Then the correct answer is revealed: A blunt-nosed viper never bites above the knee, and if your penis is that long, you can suck the venom out yourself.

-   _Oglaf_ had a comic where a guy got bitten on the dick and it swelled. So big that the healer insisted on getting down on it instead of sucking it. At least he died happy.

-   In _Sluggy Freelance_, Torg does a variation of this by sucking out the alcoholic drink that got into Gwynn's eye. Umm... yeah.

And then later we see that Dracula _did_ remove the venom... by _scraping and licking_ (never mind that Grim has no _blood_)... on Grim's _arm_.

    Real Life 

-   Robert Baden-Powell (of Boy Scouting fame) is often credited for promoting this technique for snakebite. He first heard of it observing Hindu Fakirs and snake charmers in India, who have used the "suck the poison out" method since time immemorial. Snake charmers today often use an even easier trick - they de-fang the cobras with a pair of pliers.
-   According to the official biography of Genghis Khan, he was saved by his companion Jelme after being hit with a poisoned arrow. The description by people who knew such things was definitely neither clean nor pretty: the first thing weakened and dazed Temujin saw the next morning was ground around him all _splattered with his blood_ which Jelme had to spit out in process of cleaning his wound.
-   Likewise, a legend says that Eleanor of Castile saved the life of her husband, King Edward I of England, by sucking a wound on his arm made by a poisoned dagger wielded by assassin Edward had just killed after the assassin snuck into his bedchamber and tried to kill him in his sleep. Even if she did do this, it is unlikely this had any affect on his survival, as he was severely weakened for months after the attack. Still, he and Eleanor were known to have a Perfectly Arranged Marriage, so it is quite plausible that she tried.
-   When J. R. R. Tolkien was a toddler in South Africa, he was bitten by a tarantula. He ran through the long grass to his nanny, who sucked the poison out.
-   Many camping and hunting stores sell "Venom Extractors" or "Snake Bite Kits" next to the first aid kits. While these devices are undoubtedly safer for both the rescuer and victim, they don't actually extract any meaningful amount of venom from snake bite wounds. You're much better off following the advice of actual medical professionals.
