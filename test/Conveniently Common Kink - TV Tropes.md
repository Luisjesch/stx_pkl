_"The Web brings people together because no matter what kind of a twisted sexual mutant you happen to be, you've got millions of pals out there. Type in 'Find people that have sex with goats that are on fire' and the computer will say, 'Specify type of goat'."_

— **Rich Jeni**

Alice has a problem. She's recently realized that she gets really, really excited from waxing cucumbers. But who on Earth would share a fetish for applying a shiny glaze to vegetables? Surely Alice will have to keep this desire a deep, dark secret.

Surprise! It's been Bob's life-long ambition to become a full-time cucumber waxer, he just never found anyone he could share it with. And Alice and Bob live in total gratification ever after, or at least for the duration of the story.

A staple of erotic fiction: love is never having to explain your fantasies. Whoever you choose for a partner will happen to share them (or at least be _really_ receptive), regardless of how unlikely this is or in what situation you present them. Some stories make angsting over this a plot point; most don't try.

A form of Contrived Coincidence. May be a symptom of Author Appeal. Compare Everyone Is Bi, Rule 34.

    Comic Books 

-   In a quick throwaway scene in _Transmetropolitan_, a woman stops by a man who's sitting on the ground, crying his eyes out, to ask him what's wrong. He tearfully explains that he doesn't have any friends- because he keeps eating them. To his delight, she says "Me too". Then she asks him whether he's hungry.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: Under the pen of their creator, William Moulton Marston, Diana and Steve Trevor are both inordinately pleased about getting tied up consensually and are into "loving submission". As the book was being published in the 1940s and was aimed at children, the sexual connotations are never directly addressed. And given Marston's personal preferences, pretty much every heroic character given any characterization is fond of "loving submission to women".

    Fan Fiction 

-   In one _iCarly_ fanfic, _iFight Crime With Victorious_, Carly gets to use a different power, superhuman strength, and gets excited from being able to defend herself rather than relying on Sam all the time. Nearly every character with superhuman strength reveals at some point that they get off on being so strong as well.
-   Strangely, a freakishly large amount of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ Lemon/Smut fics are BDSM or bondage or something along the lines of that. And everyone involved, whether Joyce, Willow or anyone else is into it - though, to be fair, no Buffy character ever passed up an opportunity to comment on the kinky potential of chains, Joyce included, so there's at least some evidence here. Less justifiable are Crack Ship options such as Buffy/Dawn getting the same treatment.
    -   There is one story where the kinks were shared by an entire, apparently bisexual, household of newly activated Slayers, Willow, Dawn, Buffy, Xander, Faith and the neighbors, who, when it comes to the female ones, including an underage girl, were also apparently all bi. Everyone Is Bi to a new level. The kinks: Humiliation, spanking, BDSM, public nudity, lesbian incest between sisters and groping.
-   Played with in _Cup of Tea_ as Phoenix was extremely intimated by Kristoph's interest in hardcore BDSM and only got into for his lover's sake. Phoenix comes to enjoy it but by that time the romantic aspect of their relationship is gone.
    -   Zigzagged with Phoenix and Edgeworth. Edgeworth is disgusted when he found out and Phoenix doesn't expect for him to try as he would rather have an emotionally fulfilling relationship than force him into something he doesn't want. Edgeworth does gradually get into it because he likes the act of Phoenix getting pleasure as opposed to liking BDSM itself.
-   Discussed in _Maleficent_ fanfic Your Servant Mistress - it is mentioned that dominant women are rare, and Diaval is mistaken for dominant, while he's actually submissive. Of course, Maleficent has a fetish for dominating men.
-   Inverted in a _Harry Potter_ fanfic where a Crack Pairing who would otherwise have nothing in common gets together because they discover their respective kinks for wearing silk stockings and touching silk stockings worn by someone else fit together nicely.
-   Played straight with most _Hurog_ one true threesome fanfic - complementing the Ho Yay between Oreg and Ward, the woman involved will be a Yaoi Fangirl and share her man if she's allowed to watch.
-   In _TMI_ (a _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ sex comedy), a game of Truth Or Dare leads Twilight to confess to her friends that she has a thing for interspecies porn. Rarity—who's already painted as a zebra because of an earlier Dare from the same game—reveals that _she_ has a thing for costumes and elaborate roleplaying, and asks if Twi is up for a little "rumble in the jungle". Then in the sequel, _TMI 2: The Rainbow Connection_, Rainbow Dash realizes she has a fetish about being a Badass in Distress, so she asks if Twilight and Rarity would roleplay as hostile natives and take her captive. (In part three, the answer is yes, and actual porn ensues).
-   The Dark Fic, possible Troll Fic _Pattycakes_ (Another My Little Pony fanfiction) has everypony in Ponyville into age play, being willing to take a drug that'll reduce their mind to an infintile state temporarily, even Rarity of all ponies is into this sort of thing! The only ponies opposed to it are Scootaloo and Rainbow Dash, but with the latter, she has it forced on her and eventually has her mind permanently regressed into a fully-grown foal.
-   _Code Geass: The Prepared Rebellion_: Kaguya has a cuckquean fetish and happens to be infatuated with Zero, who has two different mistresses at the time, and is liable to gain several more. C.C. even lampshades that the best way for Lelouch to keep Kaguya happy would be to marry her then continuously have sex with other women in front of her.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Fat Slags_ goes a step further. While the title characters are in London, they don't just happen to meet a Chubby Chaser. Instead, a mega-rich media mogul gets hit in the head, suffers a change of personality and "coincidentally" _becomes_ a Chubby Chaser.
-   Parodied in _Not Another Teen Movie_, when Catherine laments that she's never had a guy take a dump on her chest. A teenaged boy proclaims, "That's appalling! I can't believe no one's ever taken a dump on your chest".
-   In _Secretary_, Maggie Gyllenhaal wants to be a submissive. She works for James Spader, who wants to be a dominant. Sex ensues.

    Literature 

-   _Honor Harrington_:
    -   Surprisingly happens to (of all people, really) ultimate badass Victor Cachat. After he got himself a girlfriend at last, after all those years of being a Celibate Hero, he kinda snaps and heaps all his pent-up frustration (they've also got a serious argument just before) on her when they finally found the time to do the horizontal mambo, and wallows in misery and self-guilt afterwards. To his astonishment, Thandi _just so happened_ to be into SM, and actually wanted it _more_. Hilarity ensued indeed — the teasing poor Victor received from her and his self-appointed Cool Big Sis Ginny Usher made him "dark and utterly miserable".
    -   In addition to poor Victor, there was the collision resulting from the meeting of Thandi's Amazon Brigade of genetically-engineered mercenaries/terrorists with the genetically-engineered former slaves/terrorists/freedom fighters of Jeremy X. Two groups of hardened killers finding their (metaphorical) Opposite-Sex Clone, and stuff happens.
-   The YA novel _Flipside_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  provides a non-pornographic example. The main thrust of the story, so to speak, is the coming of age of a Wholesome Crossdresser, and it just so happens that the girl he's been lusting after for years becomes attracted to him when he's in a dress.
-   There's a book called the _Best Case Scenario Handbook_ (a parody of the _Worst Case Scenario_ one) that includes an example of these among various examples of extreme cases of good fortune. It's to the effect of someone's wife or girlfriend confessing to an interest in an unidentified sexual act that happened to be that guy's hidden fetish.
-   _John Ringo_'s A Deeper Blue has Mike Jenkins enjoy serious BDSM games, and Anastasia is a serious pain submissive. One of their favorite games is him trying to get some information from her: "I never did find out that cookie recipe".
-   _Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation: Mo Dao Zu Shi_: It's clear in the extra chapters that Wei Wuxian and Lan Wanji share a few kinks like bondage, biting, and even a rape kink. Wei Wuxian really likes blabbing out rape play scenarios whenever they get naughty and enjoys teasing his partner until he snaps and he gets tied up. Lan Wangji indulges along his partner's kinks, loves to tie him up if provoked enough, and his Erotic Dreams reveal that he indeed likes the rape play scenarios (much to his embarrassment) that Wei Wuxian comes up with during sex.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Subverted in _Sex and the City_, where the protagonist wrestles with herself over whether to indulge her date's urination fetish. She offers him compromises ("we could use warm tea..."), but is rebuffed.
    -   Played straight when Miranda's boyfriend likes to talk dirty during sex. At first she is reluctant to do so, as he urges her to talk dirty. Then she starts to like it.
-   A subversion from _Scrubs_: Elliot finally breaks down her boyfriend's resistance, and gets him to tell her (off-screen) what his sexual fantasy is. She instantly flees in horrified disgust. All the audience learns is that it _doesn't_ involve chains, whips, candle wax, role-playing, lasers, hamsters, or Mexican apple thieves.
-   This from _Coupling_:
    
    **Sally:** How is this ever going to work?
    
-   First averted, then played straight on _Seinfeld_. George develops a fetish for eating during sex. His Girl of the Week as of the start of the episode was squicked, and they broke up. However, in a later scene from the same episode, he meets a woman who is similarly aroused and wants to do it with him.
    
    **George:** Is...that pastrami?
    
    **Vivian:** Yes, it is...I find it to be the most sensual of the salted cured meats. Hungry?
    
    **George:** _Very._
    
-   A G-rated version appeared once on _Sesame Street_ of all places! In a live-action fairy tale scenario, a prince is wooing on a princess from a different kingdom, and mentions that the princess he marries must be able to _fix a sink_. Luckily (or conveniently), the princess says that she's the best sink-fixer in her kingdom; she even holds up a wrench as she says this!
-   In _Blackadder II_, Bob/Kate tells Lord Flashheart that she can't run away with him in her wedding gown because she's realized she prefers wearing boy's clothes. Flash responds "Weird. I always feel more comfy in a dress!" So they swap outfits and _then_ run away together.

    Stand-Up Comedy 

-   Steven Wright once recounted a tale in which he boarded a bus and met a nymphomaniac who's into Jewish cowboys. After she explained her problem to him, Steven introduced himself as "Bucky Goldstein". Lewis Grizzard also told a variation of it occurring on a train, and the fellow introducing himself to the nympho with the line, "Hopalong Ginsberg, at your service".
-   Averted with a girl Louis C.K. once went out with. They were making out, but every time he tried to take things further, she stopped him. The next day, she expresses disappointment that they didn't have sex and asks him why they didn't. A bewildered Louis of course said it was because she kept stopping him, so he naturally assumed she didn't want to. She then told him that she was hoping he'd go for it anyway, since she had a fantasy of a guy getting so sexually frustrated by her repeated refusals that he can no longer control himself and forces himself on her. Louis said that she should have told him that, as he would have happily played along if he had known, but she said she couldn't tell him because she needed it to feel "real and dangerous". Louis proceeded to mock how unlikely her fantasy is to _ever_ be fulfilled by _anyone_.
    
    **Louis:** What are you, out of your fucking _MIND_?! You think I'm just going to _rape_ you on the off-chance that _hopefully_ you're into that shit?!
    

    Webcomics 

-   Subverted in this _Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal_. The lovers share interests in BDSM and feet, but then the lady reveals that she has a fetish for armadillos, which weirds the guy out. Then it's revealed that the scenario was a "realistic sex book for kids" to teach them that this trope does _not_ apply in real life.
-   _Collar 6_: The entire world is apparently into BDSM. The start of the divergent history of this world was an ancient (as in, Roman or earlier) discovery of Atlantis, and how they had perfected a lifestyle/society/government that combined BDSM with spirituality in such a way that it led to world peace and sexual-lifestyle-based Ki Manipulation. The few areas of the world that didn't ascribe to this are referred to as "Puritan".
-   _El Goonish Shive_:
    -   Elliot and Sarah both have superhero-related fantasies.
    -   Tedd, who's into Gender Bending and furries, and Grace, who is a shapeshifting alien squirrel-girl.
-   The Basitins in _TwoKinds_ have a Word of God\-supported species-wide foot fetish. Considering how sexually repressed they are, unwrapped feet can stop a room full of Eastern Basitins with ease.
-   In spite of clothes being a cultural option in _Bittersweet Candy Bowl_, if you wear clothes and show your undergarments, things can get _interesting_.
-   There are a _lot_ of BDSM practitioners in _Sunstone_. Largely justified, though, as they all either met each other through the scene or entered the scene due to meeting each other.
-   In _Housepets!_, Joey, a dog who likes dressing as a cat, met his girlfriend Squeak, a mouse, when he pounced on her and she turned out to be into that.

    Web Original 

-   "My miniature stallion". For people who don't want to actually see it, it's 2 people discussing on camera how they found true love and got married over their shared love of being fucked by small horses.
-   The furry propensity towards these was deconstructed in these three stories. In each story, a character gets their hands on a latex transformative goo that just happens to be their fetish. Respectively, the substance _makes_ the potential host _think_ they have a fetish for it, it's actually a weapon to kill the addressee and everyone else in the house, and the host is a mentally unstable man having a psychotic break who thinks he's in one of the porn stories he reads.
    -   In gay transformation fetish stories, an awful lot of the men/boys transformed just happen to have undeclared crushes on their male friend who is usually transformed along with them. The friend, if they don't like dudes already, starts to by the end of the transformation.
    -   When couples in a TF story want to "try something new", and one of them picks something up from The Little Shop That Wasn't There Yesterday, their partner never finds it too odd to indulge in. For that matter, the partner who bought the transformative MacGuffin is never squicked out by it when the salesperson shows it to them.
-   One of the hosts of the ageplay-based _Big Little Podcast_ episode about communication tells a story about a man he used to chat with who had a diaper fetish but, due to growing up in the 40s and 50s kept it as secret as possible. He revealed it to his wife only once they were in their 60s and the kids were all out of the house only for _her_ to reveal her own stash of the exact same fetish items.
-   In The Nostalgia Chick's review of _Sleepy Hollow (1999),_ she plays the scene where Katrina sees the weird marks on Ichabod's hands and just smiles at him. The Chick jokes that this must be the first time she found someone who fits her weirdly specific fetish.
-   From Cracked's "9 Strangest Episodes in the History of Power Rangers:"
    
    "Also, the summary of the episode describes what happens to Tori, the Blue Ranger, as being 'bound to a cactus,' so if that happens to be your exact fetish (and this is the Internet, so it is), get ready for a good time".
    

    Western Animation 

-   _Family Guy_ plays this for laughs, of course, by showing a couple that remains happily married, because one has the perfect fetish for the other.
    
    **Asian Reporter Tricia Takanawa:** Tom, I'm standing in the bedroom of Judy and Glen Isaacs. 10 years married and still in love. What's their secret? Judy has an inoperable brain tumor the size of my fist, and that just happens to be Glen's fetish.
