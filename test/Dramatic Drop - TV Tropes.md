Good thing he wasn't holding the baby.

Dramatic Drop is kind of a step-sib to Dropped Glasses and Slow-Motion Drop. Something very startling or utterly shocking is announced or discovered — and the person encountering the shock literally drops what they're holding in astonishment. It most often falls ...and falls... and shatters at their feet — an aural punctuation mark to the bewildering announcement.

It usually occurs in specific situations:

-   The person is given shocking or bad news, or sees someone unexpected come into the room, and they drop what they're holding, so it falls to the floor, and breaks.
-   The person was doing something and is in trouble.
    -   The person was minding their own business when the bad guy comes and yanks them out of their day. What they were doing falls to the ground, broken or otherwise ruined.
    -   In examples played for comedy, characters may drop things they're holding if an attractive character comes their way.
    -   If a younger character does something or says something outrageous or rude, you can expect this trope to be played out by their parents or people nearby.
    -   The person was minding their own business, and fell ill or succumbed to some injury or illness they were previously unaware of. What they were doing gets dropped. In particular, seizures, heart attacks, catatonia due to major emotional trauma (or Heroic BSoD), etc., are frequently announced by dropping crockery.
    -   The person _dies_.
-   The person drops something in order to make a mad dash to save something more important/valuable.
-   The person is suddenly the victim of Mind Control and turns immediately to the task they've been commanded to do.

This is a very commonly used trope. It used to happen quite frequently with telephone receivers left dangling when someone gets shocking news, but the advent of cordless and cellphones has caused that usage to fall out of favor and usage. Used comedically in parodies of the ending of _The Usual Suspects_.

When the news gets cut off as the massacre begins, Nunnally drops the plate.

-   _Star Wars Expanded Universe_: In _Leia, Princess of Alderaan_, it's narrowly subverted when Moff Quarsh Panaka meets Princess Leia while holding a teacup and saucer. As Queen Amidala's former chief of security, Panaka is seriously shocked upon seeing Leia because of how much she resembles her biological mother, which is helped along by the fact that Leia had to borrow a traditional Naboo "jubilation dress" from Queen Dalné. As a result, Panaka nearly drops his cup, but manages to recover in time to only splash tea on himself.
-   In _Faith of the Fallen_, from Terry Goodkind's _Sword of Truth_, Nicci "was only dimly aware of the eggs hitting the floor" after being informed that Richard had been taken prisoner.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Used semi-humorously on _9-1-1_, when a man stuck in traffic stops to get a hot dog and drink from an equally-stuck food truck. He asks two other customers what they're giggling about on their phones, and when shown an online clip of the cause of the highway stoppage — a middle-aged woman in mid-nervous breakdown, standing on an overpass platform and alternately screaming at and flashing the road below — he immediately drops his purchases and takes off running, as the woman in the live viral footage is _his own wife_.
-   In the _Angel_ episode "Sanctuary", Wesley walks into an alley intent on attacking Faith, who just spent the last couple hours torturing him.

-   One of the most memorable episodes of _Mr. Bean_, "Back to School Mr. Bean". Bean drops the pastry he's eating after a Double Take when his car gets flattened by a tank. To be fair, he _did_ ignore the "Reserved Parking" warning and removed the traffic cones earlier at the episode's start.

    -   In one episode, Blackadder "accidentally" drops a tray full of refreshments after the Prince insults him one time too many, leading him to the brink of resigning at that very moment.

    -   In one episode, Big Mike drops his danish (a huge shift in moment-to-moment priorities for the character) when the fire alarm is pulled at the Buy More.

He intended to drop her off only twelve hours after they left, but they arrive twelve _months_ into the future. Rose's mum thought her daughter was _dead_, and she's so stunned at her daughter's sudden return (while Rose has no idea of how much time really passed) she drops her coffee mug and it smashes into pieces... what a waste of good Joe. And then she furiously bitch-slaps the Doctor when she hears that he's responsible for whisking away her beloved child for a year.
    -   "Boom Town" has it just offscreen: The Ninth Doctor goes to confront a previous enemy, who is currently Mayor of Cardiff, and asks her receptionist to tell her "The Doctor" is there to see her. He goes in, the Doctor turns, waits... and looks rather smug when he hears something shatter.

-   _Jejak Suara Adzan_: In the penultimate episode, Ririn drops the cup that she was holding, shattering it, when she collapses unconscious due to her heart problems.
-   _Kamen Rider Double_: This is the Character Tic of Kazu, who drops whatever he's holding almost every single time he's asked a question or is told something even remotely dramatic. (This is in almost every scene he's in.) He hardly even seems to be fazed by this in any way, regardless of what he may be holding, be it a spoon, a suitcase, a teacup, etc., even if the object breaks. It seems to be foreshadowing towards his telekinetic powers, and becomes a Brick Joke when he transforms into the Utopia Dopant by dropping the Utopia Gaia Memory and letting his Gaia Driver suck the falling Memory in.

The actress's reaction in the first take was genuine, and the director decided to keep it in later takes.
-   In one episode of _Matlock_, a woman drops a tea tray when she walks into her living room and sees the murder victim lying dead on the floor. This turns out to be a plot point, because the absence of tea stains on the carpet confirms Matlock's suspicions that she was the murderer, and she dropped the tea tray deliberately to feign surprise for the benefit of an onlooker.
-   Wendy is consoling herself with ice cream from the carton because she just screwed up _badly_ and got sent home by her boss, _The Middle Man_, when roommate Lacey casually mentions that the Villain of the Week is hanging out at the restaurant from which she just quit working.

Lampshaded and played with in the same episode: Randy tells Stottlemeyer to put down his coffee mug so he won't drop it when he hears the news. He puts it down, but when Randy tells him that Linda is dead, he picks it up again and hurls it against the wall.
-   _Mortified_: Taylor drops the bowl she is carrying when she looks at the window and sees her father pumping iron in the backyard in "Parent Teacher Night".

    **Rumpelstiltskin:** You will serve me my meals, and you will clean the Dark Castle... You will dust my collection and launder my clothing... You will fetch me fresh straw when I'm spinning at the wheel... Oh! And you will skin the children I hunt. For their pelts.

He has to go back to get the Commandments since he had broken the Laws, and God apparently had failed to keep a spare copy.
-   Judas reportedly spilled his salt when Jesus announced that someone would betray him. (This detail does not however appear in the Bible. A huge amount of folklore has grown up to fill in the details of Biblical stories, much of it originating centuries later in medieval Europe. It would have been quite odd for the Disciples to have salt on the table, as salt was a precious commodity in First Century AD Rome.)

    Real Life 

-   A less dramatic, but memorable example occurs during a lecture by L. Ron Hubbard on the events of OT III. When he gets to the part about how Xenu used his last moments in office (he was about to be forcibly "un-elected") to "goof the floof", an attendee can be heard dropping their pencil, apparently in shock. Hubbard comments on this:
-   According to Rob Halford of Judas Priest, this happened when he came out of the closet in 1998, which was basically a slip of the tongue. During an interview with MTV, he accidentally said "Speaking as a gay man..." while he was talking about something else, and the next thing he heard was the sound of the producer dropping his clipboard in shock.
-   In the book _Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ_, one example of emotional reaction is a waitress who dropped a tray of six dinners in shock when she saw a woman who had long, curly red hair like the woman her husband left her for.
