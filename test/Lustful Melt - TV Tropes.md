A fairly common staple of Western Animation, this trope involves a character being so enamoured with another, their whole body turns into a puddle of goo. Can be used as the female equivalent of Something Else Also Rises (and often is, as seen in a lot of 1990s Warner Bros. Animation cartoons, like _Animaniacs_ and _Tiny Toon Adventures_).

Male characters can experience this too, but it's either used as a Censor Decoy if the censors don't want implications of erections to be shown or if the writer wants to move past metaphorically showing an erection or ejaculation and go straight to metaphorically showing an orgasm/post-coital come-down or if the writers want to show that a male character isn't as masculine as he appears to be (this is going by the knowledge that if the Something Else Also Rises trope is shorthand for an erection, then the Lustful Melt is almost always the female equivalent and putting feminine traits in a masculine character is almost always good for a laugh or some character development).

A Sub-Trope of I'm Melting!, Harmless Liquefaction and a (sometimes) Distaff Counterpart of Something Else Also Rises. Contrast Shameful Shrinking.

    Advertising 

-   An ad for raspberry flavor M&M's Premiums features Green making a passionate speech regarding the candy - and finding that Red, Yellow and Blue are all melting in response to her performance.
-   A series of humorous ads for Norton Antivirus 2011 involved celebrities (representing cyber criminals) wanting to do bad things to critters/inanimate objects/etc (representing the viewer's PC/identity/etc.). The viewer had the choice to deny or allow this to happen. One of these was David Hasselhoff and an oscillating fan. One of the "allow" outcomes was Hasselhoff seducing the fan, causing it to melt.

    **Hasselhoff:** _\[in German\]_ I am a sex machine. You are a wind machine. Let's get it on. _\[fan melts\]_

    Fan Works 

-   _The Forbidden Drink_ has Amity do this as a result of Luz turning into an Amazonian Beauty after drinking Titan Blood in a desperation move to stop Belos from using it. The rest of the cast teases her relentlessly for _literally_ melting into Abomination Goo, a rather advanced magical technique, over Luz's physical changes.
-   In _The Owl Lady's Chick_, after Amity kisses Luz on the cheek for getting her library card back, Luz, who was wearing The Mask and thus subject to Toon Physics, melts into a puddle.
-   This parody of _Steven Universe_ has Pearl having some, ahem, issues with her physical form upon seeing Rose in a pretty bikini.
    
    **Pearl:** You look resplendent.
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Amélie_, but here it represents heartbreak rather than lust. You could say that she dissolved into tears.

    Music 

-   Barry Louis Polisar:
    -   In "With A Giggle and A Hug and A Tickle and A Kiss", the singer describes his unexpected falling in love as "melting in \[the beloved's\] arms".
        
        _It's hard to think I'd let myself be captured by your charms_  
        _In the middle of a snowstorm I'm melting in your arms._
        
    -   "You're As Sweet as Sugar On A Stick" has a line where after kissing his beloved, the narrator expresses his pounding heart as "Like water down a drain, dropping drip by drip".

    _I melt every time you look at me that way  
    It never fails anytime, any place  
    This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt  
    I melt_
    

    Webcomics 

-   This is a quirk of Muko in _Furry Fight Chronicles_ when surrounded by attractive females or aroused to a certain level. Weirdly enough for a comic that doesn't rely very much on Toon Physics, it later becomes treated in-story as a weakness that needs to be addressed after Muko undergoes Character Development and realizes that her lust is preventing her from becoming a true Combagal.
-   In _Sidekick Girl_, Illumina does this after meeting the mysterious Maelstrom ... not realizing that his secret identity is her boyfriend.
