**Dean Chesney:** God helps those who help themselves.  
**Nate Ford:** And I help people who can't.

— _Leverage_, "The Cross My Heart Job"

A heroic party whose official professions are defined vaguely enough to allow them to go on all sorts of adventures. Generally requires only one catch (like simply being paid) to take any job no matter how unusual or apparently trite, and all are treated with the same amount of professionalism.

A noticeable trend is for these groups to be some variation of either mercenary work or detective work. If dealing with supernatural forces, you _literally_ have a Who You Gonna Call? on your hands. Adventure Guild is a subtrope commonly found in a Role-Playing Game 'Verse.

People who do this stuff without getting paid generally have Chronic Hero Syndrome. A variant might be that they'll charge based on the client's ability to pay, lowering or even waiving their fees if the case is interesting enough or the customer is in dire enough straits.

Someone who wanders from place to place doing this is a Knight Errant.

Named for the slogan of Angel Investigations in _Angel_. Their original line was in fact "We help the hopeless" but it mutated into "helpless" at some point.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   _City Hunter_: Most of Ryo's works involves protecting helpless and sympathetic clients from assasins, and while his work motto is only working for beautiful women, he willingly takes jobs from desperate men and children without a paycheck.

-   The ninjas from _Naruto_ are rather like this, jobs ranging from mercenary work to finding a lost cat.
-   The MITHRIL Organization from the _Full Metal Panic!_ series, on an international scale. They are, amongst other things, hired by the UN to clean up civil wars and stop ethnic cleansing.

-   _Magical Princess Minky Momo_: Her mission is to help spread happiness and joy to those most desperately in need of it.
-   In _Hajime no Ippo_, Takeshi Sendoh's backstory has him as an ex-gang leader whose followers actually fought against other gangs to counterattack their abuse of other students. And ever since he was a child, Sendou strove to protect his friends from bullies: his motto was "Leave this to me! I'm gonna protect you ALL".
-   The Black Knights from _Code Geass_ are told that their missions is to protect the weak. Even if they are at times being manipulated, they do eventually manage to fulfill this role.
-   _The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service_: The characters use their various abilities (supernatural or not) to aid ghosts move on to the afterlife. The ghosts usually tell them to sell their no-longer-necessary material goods as payment.
-   Lupin and the gang from _Lupin III_ (though mostly the anime adaptations and _not_ the original manga). They're career criminals, but will often help out those in need, especially if they're being harassed by even worse criminals.
-   Sawamura Seiji in _Midori Days_ uses his considerable martial prowess to this end because he was bullied as a child.
-   Starwind and Hawking Enterprises in _Outlaw Star_ has a slogan that just screams, "We'll do anything, please pay us!"
    
    **Jim Hawking:** _Hello! You've reached Hawking, from Starwind and Hawking Repairs! We fix everything from tractors to relationships, so how can we help you today?_
    
-   While not originally their intention, the Straw Hat Pirates in _One Piece_ have reluctantly done this on various occasions throughout the manga's (and anime's) run.
-   Automail mechanics, in the _Fullmetal Alchemist_ universe, do this. They provide artificial limbs for people who would otherwise be incredibly helpless.
-   _The Big O_: Roger Smith, a "negotiator" (something of a cross between a mediator and a private detective), prides himself in accepting jobs from children and the elderly. Being independently wealthy, he accepts remuneration according to the client's ability to pay, and will work _pro bono_ if necessary.
-   The titular organization from _UQ Holder!_ are a group of various immortals who help those that society has forsaken. They also hunt down evil immortals that give good immortals a bad name.
-   The Yorozuya in _Gintama_ regularly take on odd jobs and end up helping all sorts of people and not just for the money.
-   Minako Aino from Sailor Moon just can't stop herself from helping anyone in need she stumbles upon, especially in her solo series, no matter the trouble she may get in doing so (once got late to school, once she nearly missed a lottery she wanted to take part in and ended up winning it as _Sailor V_, and once she nearly exposed her Secret Identity), and without asking for rewards (and the one time she _was_ given a reward for helping a mangaka completing the next chapter before the deadline Artemis convinced her to give it back).
-   In _Tokyo Shinobi Squad_, this is the philosophy of the Narumi-kai. They refuse to take jobs they consider dirty and immoral, only fighting to help the less fortunate from those who would harm them. Unfortunately, in a crime-ridden city like Tokyo, this means their paychecks aren't particularly large. Jin's stubborn refusal to take on jobs from well-paying clients who'd use him for dirty tasks earns him the ire of the office designed to regulate shinobi activity as they try to strongarm him into doing these jobs.
    
    **Jin:** I didn't become a shinobi to curry favor from the elites. I'm only taking on the jobs I want. Nothing has changed.
    
-   This was Touch Me's main _raison d'etre_ in _Overlord (2012)_, and why he formed the party Nine's Own Goal. In _YGGDRASIL_, players who picked the monstrous Heteromorphic races were often bullied by those that picked Humanoid or Demi-Human ones, and the mass slaughter of Heteromorphs was even a requirement to take certain job classes. Touch Me, a Heteromorph himself who liked to role play as a Knight in Shining Armor, would swoop in to save any fellow Heteromorph who was under attack, including protagonist Momonga.

    Comic Books 

-   _Jon Sable, Freelance_. Although Jon is a mercenary, he charges on a sliding scale of fees. And if he believes in the rightness of a particular cause, that fee may be purely nominal.
-   _Heroes for Hire_ Power Man and Iron Fist, though if the cause is just enough, they'll waive the fee.

-   _Doctor Strange_ has occasionally been known to investigate supernatural cases for a fee.

-   There is a reason why Superman was called "Champion of the Oppressed" back in the Golden Age. Despite having the powers of a god and could take over the world with barely a thought, he'd rather stop runaway trains and rescue cats from trees. Demonstrated in this quote:
    
    **Black Adam:** You fight for the Wizard?  
    **Superman:** I fight for those who can't fight for themselves!
    
-   Supergirl can't stop herself from helping people in need. During the early Silver Age she spent more time protecting the weak and making people happy anonymously than fighting super-villains. "Help for all" is, actually, her motto.
    
    **Supergirl:** My cousin once said in an interview that he stood for "Truth, Justice and the American Way of Life". If anyone asked me, I'd say I stand for "Hope, Help and Compassion For All."
    
-   _The Walking Dead_ has _Negan_ of all people state that the concept of society is _built_ on this trope, further adding to his Anti-Villain nature.
    
    **Negan:** Maybe you fucking nutcases need me. Because if that's how you do things, you're so fucked in the head you might as well be dead bodies pretending you're still fucking alive.
    
-   _Zorro_: Although Lady Rawhide initially begins her career out of a desire for revenge, she quickly moves on to Zorro's goal of fighting injustice and helping the poor and downtrodden.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Origin Story_, it is noted several different times that Alex Harris (the Kryptonian superhero known as Superwoman) spends more time helping people and stopping natural disasters than she does fighting supervillains. She actually calls the Avengers out for being more interested in fighting amongst each other than helping people.
    
    You people call yourselves heroes, but all you're doing is running around fighting each other! When was the last time you fed the hungry? When was the last time you helped irrigate a desert? When was the last time you were there for someone who just needed a friend? That's what being a hero is all about. You're all like children, throwing temper tantrums.
    

    Film 

-   _A Few Good Men_ has the Marines realizing that "We were supposed to fight for the people who couldn't fight for themselves."
-   The eponymous team in _Ghostbusters (1984)_, whose philosophy, as Peter says in a television ad, is that "no job is too big, no _fee_ is too big!" Though they do milk business customers like the Sedgewick Hotel for all they're worth, they're more forgiving when it comes to private individuals like Dana and Louis.
-   _Seven Samurai_ gives a somewhat ambivalent and often cynical treatment of this. It's remake, _The Magnificent Seven (1960)_, plays the whole situation as straight, unambiguous heroics.
-   The Jedi in _Star Wars_ are an order of peacekeepers who go about the galaxy defending the Republic and those who are a part of it. Although they aren't a part of any law enforcement, they do command a lot of respect and influence, and sometimes even their very presence is enough to help someone out.

    Literature 

-   Skeeve's team and later the _M.Y.T.H. Inc._ crew (in "Some kind of MYTHsomething" by Robert Asprin) seems to take any client who can meet their fees. Admittedly, they've built up such a reputation by now that not just anyone can afford to hire them.
-   Repairman Jack from F. Paul Wilson's series of novels will fix anything, barring mechanical appliances.

-   Sir Michael from the _Knight and Rogue Series_ by Hilari Bell is like this. It gets him in some trouble.
-   The Steel General of Roger Zelazny's _Creatures of Light and Darkness_. "Behold the one who comes upon scenes of chaos, and whose cold metal hand supports the weak and the oppressed."
-   Travis McGee, from John D. MacDonald's novels. He usually gives his profession as 'salvage consultant'. His normal fee is the half of value of whatever he is hired to recover; if the client object he's quick to remind them half of the lost property/money is considerably more than none of it. Will occasionally wave the fee entirely For Great Justice.
-   Tamora Pierce has a character named Kel — the heroine of the aptly-named _Protector of the Small_ quartet. Kel spends most of her time outside training kicking the collective asses of anyone who picks on helpless people. She's _good_ at it, too.
-   Harry Dresden from _The Dresden Files_, the only professional wizard in Chicago. A lot of people ask him why he fights so hard, so unswervingly, for the muggle population that doesn't even believe in the things he fights. Behind the facade of snark, the real reason is that he doesn't think it's right that anyone, any_thing_, is picking on the helpless.
    -   The Knights of the Cross are also known for this. There are only three of them, but each one is the bearer of a sword whose hilt has one of the Nails of the Cross worked in - the same nails that were impaled into Christ. They travel the world and help people. Believing in the big G isn't a necessity either, even though they work with literal angels. They just have a strong conviction of helping those who are in danger.
-   Downplayed in Witcher universe. Sure, witchers are mutated, raised and trained to kill monsters, Walking the Earth for rest of their days and actively seeking dangers to fight... but being characters from Low Fantasy Deconstructor Fleet they do it for reasonable price and only when they find it worth the hassle. Or when rent is due.
-   K.A Applegate's _Animorphs_ series plays this trope straight — in several books, the characters (who are fighting a guerrilla war against an occupying alien force) complain about missing school, yet they always end up skipping school _anyway_ to fight the good fight.
-   _Star Wars: Allegiance_: The Hand of Judgment doesn't even get paid. They are five stormtroopers who left the Empire—or, as one of them says, "The Empire left us" when the ISB went after one of them for refusing to kill unarmed civilians; this incident made them realize that the Empire was no longer what it had been when they signed up, so they stole an ISB ship and fled. From there, while they argued about what to do, they kept running into situations where Imperial citizens, or people they _thought_ were Imperial citizens, were in danger, and they kept trying to help them.

-   Some of Discworld's recurring protagonists fulfill this role. When asked why, their response is usually along the lines of "because _someone_ has to."
-   This is one of the Ideals of an order of the Knights Radiant in the _The Stormlight Archive_.
    
    _"I will protect those who cannot protect themselves."_
    
-   One of the jobs of the Seeker of Truth in Sword of Truth series. Because of all of the world-threatening dangers that Richard ends up fighting, he very rarely has time to help the little guys. Knowing this, when he _does_ have time, he teaches them to help themselves, often leading by example. It's surprisingly effective.
    -   Kahlan had a similar moment, but only if the definition of 'helpless' includes "tiny military force pitting themselves against hilariously larger force".
-   The Thirty in David Gemmell's _Legend_ are a group of warrior-monks destined to die in battle. They only fight once in their lives, and so choose only battles that appear to be hopeless.

-   In Mercedes Lackey's Tarma & Kethry stories, part of the Valdemar setting, Kethry's magical sword 'Need' compels her to help any woman in trouble. Sometimes, even if the woman in question doesn't WANT help.
-   The titular heroes of _The Mouse Watch_ do more than fight R.A.T.S. and solve crimes. They save animals (and humans) who are in any kind of danger, and their training video says their duties can include "helping an elderly person cross the street" and "helping build a well for a thirsty village".
-   _Sherlock Holmes_ is one of the most iconic examples. As a Private Detective, many of Holmes's cases are brought to him by clients needing help, up to and including Inspector Lestrade and the rest of Scotland Yard. Holmes charges his clients for his efforts, but he'll sometimes waive the fee for clients who have limited means and/or especially interesting problems. He's also been known to ignore requests from the wealthy and powerful when their cases don't interest him in favor of commoner clients whose problems appeal to him.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Angel_, Angel Investigations started with the slogan "We help the hopeless", as its original advertising slogan, but it evolved into "helpless" in later seasons, and in at least one instance, "We hope you're helpless."
-   _The A-Team_:
    
    "In 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire... The A-Team."
    
-   _The Goodies_ in that, when they're not carrying out zany schemes for themselves, they actually do want money for what they do, but they usually do it so _badly_ that they're lucky if they get off scot-free. In one episode they pledged to not do any more charity work and the next person who wanted help better pay up for it... and then the next person who walks in is a beautiful woman. They promptly forget their pledge, and help her anyway.
-   _The Equalizer_ does this to atone for the things he's done as an agent for "The Company". In the pilot he just asks for the client to donate a small fee to charity in payment, and he implies that he's already made enough money through his work for the Company (enough to afford a Jaguar and expensive apartment) not to charge people.
-   _Knight Rider_
    
    "Michael Knight. A young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless, the powerless, in a world of criminals who operate above the law."—the Opening Narration
    
-   Paladin in _Have Gun – Will Travel_
-   _Vengeance Unlimited_, for one million dollars or a favor.
-   _The Pretender_ does it for free, since he can steal from the baddies' bank accounts.

-   The WWE tag team, sometimes trio, The Acolyte Protection Agency (APA for short) hired themselves out to various underdog faces for bodyguarding, six-man-tag-teaming, and general-purpose ass-kicking. They even had a few faux-commercials for their services, with the tag line "APA: 'cause we need beer money!"
    -   Also see Kronik late in the run of WCW, though they were just as likely to take a job For the Evulz.

-   The crew of the good ship _Serenity_ in _Firefly_. As an added bonus, some of their jobs _do_ involve helping the helpless; for instance, upon realizing that one of their jobs involves _exploiting_ the helpless, Captain Mal does a Heel–Face Turn and brings the stolen loot back. In the words of Mal: "We rob from the rich and sell to the poor."

-   _Leverage_ has this from the second episode on (in the pilot each of the 5 thieves made out with over $32 million on short-sold stock).
    -   _Leverage_ is an odd duck because, unlike most other examples of this trope, the characters really don't need money very much at all and are therefore never broke. But then, international thieves are a lot like stock brokers: if the guy's broke, he's probably not worth hiring.
-   _Sanctuary_ has a slight twist on this, as the main characters generally help abnormal humans, while fighting the more dangerous ones.

-   _Doctor Who_: The Doctor and whatever companions are hanging with him this week- whether it be creepy statues or the end of reality itself. Not really a 'profession', of course; the Doctor does it for the glory of seeing everything cool in the universe and helping people.
    
    **The (Twelfth) Doctor:** I'm not a good man! I'm not a bad man! I'm not a hero! I'm not a President! And no, I'm not an officer! You know who I am? I am an _idiot_... with a box and a screwdriver, passing through, helping out. And I don't need an army, I never have.
    
-   _Person of Interest_ is about an ex-CIA officer who needs a sense of purpose and a billionaire software developer with a conscience; they help people who are _going_ to be the victims of violent crimes, according to the predictions of a government surveillance supercomputer. In other words, Big Brother helps the helpless.

-   In _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, following the events of _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_, the organization begins to reformat itself back into this, which was its original purpose before everyone got ideas about "stopping threats before they start." Skye has a quick conversation to this effect with the leader of a Differently Powered Individual colony.
    
    **Skye:** He could hurt people!  
    **Jiaying:** Those people aren't my concern.  
    **Skye:** Well, they're mine. I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
    
-   _The Defenders (2017)_
    -   _Daredevil (2015)_: Nelson & Murdock is a firm that provides legal services to working class residents in Hell's Kitchen that can't go anywhere else. For instance, they decide to defend Karen Page because Matt knows from her heartbeat that she's innocent, she admits that she doesn't have any money to afford an attorney, and she's their first client in the seven hours since Matt and Foggy signed the lease for their office space.
    -   _Jessica Jones (2015)_: Jessica Jones' private investigation business caters to all walks of life. She's reliable enough (when sober) that high-price attorneys like Jeri Hogarth and corporate billionaires like Joy Meachum are willing to employ her services. That said, she puts aside the issue of money whenever it comes to helping those that Kilgrave has victimized.
    -   _Luke Cage (2016)_: Luke's initial superheroics against Cottonmouth are all in the name of the innocent Harlem residents that Cottonmouth harasses and intimidates. In fact, a Running Gag of the show is people offering Luke money in exchange for his superheroics, or telling him he could charge money for his services, and Luke refusing (especially funny given Luke's "Heroes For Hire" past in the comics).
-   In _Elementary_, Sherlock, unlike most incarnations of Sherlock Holmes, doesn't charge at all for his services, relying on the fact his family is _very_ wealthy, and his dad will pay the bills as long as he's clean. Lampshaded by an exception early on; when he expresses his dislike of a bank by charging them twelve times his usual fee, he tells Watson he's going to have to make up a usual fee. And then multiply it by twelve.
-   The _Helmets_ TV spot, devised by the campaign group Crimestoppers, depicted members of the general public this way, showing a group of predatory men repelled from accosting two young women by the presence of patrolling citizens in police helmets, with the message being that a culture of vigilance in reporting crime helps reduces its occurrence.
-   In _The Magician_, Tony Blake is independently wealthy, and will freely use his skills to aid anyone he thinks is facing injustice.
-   _Star Trek: Picard_:
    -   Jean-Luc Picard is among the very few people in the Alpha and Beta Quadrants who wanted to save Romulan lives when the Romulan star was about to explode. His personal mission is to rescue Soji from the Zhat Vash. In "Stardust City Rag", he describes her to Seven of Nine as:
        
        **Picard:** Someone who has no else to help her, someone who will likely die if I don't.
        
    -   As a Qowat Milat acolyte, Elnor chooses to bind his sword to Picard's quest because it meets the requirements for worthiness, i.e. it's a lost cause. Protecting Picard (a fragile elderly man) and rescuing Soji (a sentient android whose life is in grave danger) requires Elnor to confront the Tal Shiar _and_ the Zhat Vash on his lonesome, which would be an impossible task for anyone who isn't a Qowat Milat.
        -   Technically, Elnor is not Hugh's qalankhkai because he didn't swear the oath, yet he behaves exactly like one. Hugh is a Non-Action Guy, so Elnor takes it upon himself to be his bodyguard, and he supports Hugh's goal to seize control of the Artifact from the Romulan Free State because the latter had sanctioned the slaughter of the xBs. Even after Hugh dies, Elnor is still willing to implement Hugh's plan because, as the older man reminds Elnor before he passes away, it's a lost cause.
    -   The goal of the Fenris Rangers, a vigilante group which includes Seven of Nine, is to help those who have no one to help them in the lawless regions of the former Romulan Neutral Zone.
    -   As the Executive Director of the Borg Reclamation Project, Hugh supervises the recuperation of ex-Borg drones who have recently undergone the reclamation procedure. The xBs are the most loathed people in the galaxy, so virtually no one is willing to make the effort to understand that they're victims who need help. Hugh was once part of the Collective, so he knows all too well what it's like to be in their place, and he tries his best to care for those who have no else to care for them.
-   In the South African series _Shadow_, the title character is a Vigilante Man who funds his activities by stealing from whatever gangster he takes on in the course of an episode, and sometimes he passes on some of this money to the client if he thinks they need it.

    Music 

-   "The Protomen" has Megaman helping the populace who cryptically/symbolically chant 'We are the dead.'

    Tabletop Games 

-   The majority of adventuring parties in any given Tabletop Games, especially _Dungeons & Dragons_, also tend to be like this, as a cheap and easy way for the Game Master to get the adventure started.
    -   A particular Hat of the Lawful Good alignment.
        -   Neutral Good characters can often fit this as well.
    -   Superhero RPGs are perhaps an even better example.
    -   In contrast, _Dark Heresy_ characters distinctly don't help the helpless. In fact, since the players work for the Inquisition, chances are they are actively killing the helpless just in case they happen to be Chaos tainted.
    -   _Shadowrun_ teams with any sort of ethics at all tend to fall into this category. Of course, most Shadowrunners are immoral scumbuckets who'd slit their own mama's throat for a single nuyen, but the player characters are exceptions. Hopefully.
-   Troubleshooters from _Paranoia_ treat all jobs with the same amount of professionalism. That amount is zero. They find trouble, they shoot it.
-   In _Forgotten Realms_ — pretty much all and any adventuring groups, chartered or not, that have no strict official affiliation. This is to be expected, as this setting was married to _Dungeons & Dragons_ from a very young age.
-   The Knights Hospitaller in _Infinity_ are an order of warrior monks who see it as their sacred duty to help others. From protecting their allies to going on high risk missions to liberate captives and prisoners of war.
-   While the vast majority of mercenaries in _BattleTech_ are _not_ this; the Brotherhood of Randis are. A Christian order of Humongous Mecha pilots, the Brotherhood operates in the impoverished and pirate infested worlds of the Periphery. When they aren't delivering righteous beatdowns to said pirates, they are building schools and hospitals. Any money they receive in thanks is invested into their organization.
-   _Princess: The Hopeful_: This is the specific Duty of the Champions, who regain Wisps whenever they help someone do something they couldn't do on their own or protect the innocent from harm.

    Video Games 

-   _Elite Beat Agents_ ...but they mainly just dance around to music so people have the courage to actually do the job themselves.
-   Chromas from _Phantom Brave_, including the protagonist Marona.
-   The motivation of Phoenix Wright. Of course, he'd _like_ to get paid and take cases like a normal lawyer. It's just that almost all of his clients are close personal friends, dead broke but obviously innocent, or find some way to shanghai him into getting involved in the case. His sense of justice doesn't let him turn the jobs down.
-   Interestingly, both factions of the _Command & Conquer: Tiberium_ saga, the Global Defense Initiative and the Brotherhood of Nod, lay claim to this trope. GDI frequently rescues civilians from the horrors of war and disaster, while Nod's entire ideology revolves around offering sanctuary and purpose to the downtrodden.
-   Garrus describes his team of mercs as this in _Mass Effect 2_. Shepard can be this in every game if the player chooses.
    
    **Shepard:** Listen, you're stuck here until this quarantine is over. That could take weeks. What you really need is to get this problem solved right now. That's what I do — solve problems.
    
    -   Tali even does some Lampshade Hanging: "What is it about you that makes people think we enjoy being in harm's way?"
-   The protagonists of the _Dragon Age_ games can optionally be played as this kind of Small Steps Hero. They can take time out of their saving-the-world adventures to do things like give money to an orphaned child or track down supplies for homeless refugees. Some of their companions, most notably in _Dragon Age: Origins_, may express frustration or even outright contempt for these tendencies.
    -   Cole from _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ is obsessed with helping people due to his empathic abilities; he used to be a serial killer who would target people who wanted to die, until he finally understood that this was wrong. Now he instead works to help everyone around him in every way he can; the Inquisitor can gain approval from Cole by helping everyone they meet, even if Cole isn't in the active party at the time. It's suggested that this is because he's a Spirit of Compassion who was trapped in the material world.
    -   At the end of _Inquisition,_ and again at the end of its final DLC _Trespasser_, this can be seen in a few ways depending on the player's choices. If Leliana has been made Divine Victoria, she rededicates the Chantry to this cause. If Blackwall is released, he takes to Walking the Earth and doing exactly this by bringing hope to people like himself. And if the Grey Wardens are not banished from Orlais, they sever ties with the motherhouse at Weisshaupt and commit themselves to doing more than just hunting darkspawn to help the people of Thedas.
-   Samus Aran's missions _Metroid_ series are generally simple; investigate a disturbance on a planet, exterminate all the metroids, etc. But in quite a few games, she goes above and beyond the strict terms of her contract due to her own heroic sensibilities. The two most extreme examples are perhaps _Prime 2_ (sent to investigate the missing Bravo team; ends up saving an entire planet from the same creatures that killed Bravo Team), and _Fusion_ (Sent to exterminate the X Parasites, ends up _defying her orders_ and breaking her contract in order to exterminate not only them, but also destroy the illegal, Federation-run Metroid cloning project and the planet of SR-388). One can only imagine her collecting her meager contract for the investigations that kicked off each adventure. As far as _Fusion_ goes, she might not even get paid for that mission, given the end result.
-   The _Star Fox_ team routinely goes on interplanetary campaigns to eliminate Lylat System-spanning empires because they honestly want to save the system. Of course, they always make a point of collecting their (often _extremely_ large) payment for the job. They have to eat somehow.
-   This is one of the reasons Petra gives to Scarecrow in _Emerald City Confidential_ when he asks her why she became a detective.
-   Invoked in _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_ in terms of how Militaires Sans Frontières are operating in Costa Rica. As a country with no military force, it is defenseless against the invading CIA-backed Peace Sentinel force. Even after it becomes apparent their clients are associated with the KGB, MSF continue with their mission until the CIA is pushed out of the country.
-   In _Xenoblade Chronicles X_, BLADE's primary mission is to recover the Lifehold core, but they're generally designed to be able to respond to anything and everything that the citizens of New Los Angeles need. From fighting off dangerous Indigens and hostile Xenoforms, Scouting the planet and installing Data Probes, solving domestic disputes, finding lost pets, and anything else under Mira's five moons. Granted, BLADE IS divided into divisions that supposedly specialize in more specific fields but any BLADE, regardless of division, can accept any job if they feel they can handle it. So it's not uncommon for, say, a Harrier to provide marriage counseling, or an Outfitter to gun down a rampaging Millisaur if they need to. This is justified in universe, as humanity has only been living on the planet for a couple of months prior to the game's start, and they know next to nothing about it. Such flexibility is ideal in a situation where anything can happen.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_
    -   In the series' mythology, this falls within the realm of Stendarr, the Aedric Divine God of Mercy, Justice, and Compassion. He is a protector deity and heavily associated with Restoration magic. His Commandment states: "Be kind and generous to the people of Tamriel. Protect the weak, heal the sick, and give to the needy."
    -   Fittingly, in _Skyrim_, the Vigil of Stendarr is a Church Militant order dedicated to hunting down and destroying supernatural threats to mortal life, including Daedra, Daedra worshipers, vampires, lycanthropes, and others. The Vigil formed in the wake of the Oblivion Crisis with the goal of preventing any similar incidents. The Vigil believes itself to be doing good and helping the helpless, which is, for the most part, accurate. They'll cure disease free of charge and work to eliminate supernatural threats to mortal life. However, they can also veer into Knight Templar territory pretty easily.
-   In his solo ending, Heath from _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_ moves to Ilia and becomes a mercenary, where it's noted that "\[h\]e fought not for country, but for people in need."
-   This becomes Will's entire mission in life in _Advance Wars Days of Ruin_, after finding the entire world destroyed and being rescued by Brenner's Wolves. Most notably is when he throws a villain's attempt at Breaking Him By Talking by admitting that the villain's right and that it doesn't matter:
    
    **Waylon:** Stuff it junior! You and your little toy soldiers make me sick! All self-righteous... Struttin' around like you own the damn joint... You ain't helpin' people because you care! You do it to feel important! You're a hypocrite, and you ain't better than me! Least I'm honest! Least ol' Waylon's honest about who and what I am!  
    **Will:** ...Maybe you're right. Maybe we are the same. You do what you want to do, and so do I. You fly around and act like a jerk because it's what you want to do. And I help people because it's what I want to do. Does that make me a hypocrite? If I do nothing, people will suffer. People will die. You say I do this to feel important, and maybe you're right. But if that saves even one life, then it's worth it. Understand?  
    **Waylon:** Why, you little sack of crap! I heard enough! Folks like you never live very long, anyway. I'm gonna bury you, kid!
    
-   _Red Dead Redemption II_: The Van der Linde Gang's philosophy as summarized by Dutch is "we shoot fellas as need shootin', save fellas as need savin', and feed 'em as need feedin'." However, the romantic nature of the crusading outlaw becomes _brutally_ deconstructed over the course of the game; if Dutch indeed wanted to help others and retreat from the modern world while spreading his quasi-Luddist philosophy, he could've started some sort of anarcho-primitivist collective and lived peacefully in the wilderness. But his insistence on maintaining an Old West gang and fighting injustice through force of arms means that the modern world will always be at his heels hunting him down. Just being a band of outlaws in the first place requires them to fend off other, more vicious gangs for territory and dominance, leaving little time for heroism, while Dutch himself slowly becomes (or is revealed as) a tyrant who doesn't allow anything less than unwavering loyalty in the ranks. Ultimately, all they've got separating them from the O'Driscolls in the eyes of the law is a code of ethics and a mission statement, and the law doesn't give a damn about good intentions. Whether Dutch sincerely believes in his Robin Hood ideals or is using them as an excuse to justify a life of crime is left up to the player, but taking advice from Micah, a trigger-happy psycho who's only looking out for number one, is what ultimately dooms the gang.
-   _Trails Series_ has the Bracer Guild who are paid to help out their customers and hunt down monsters to protect the citizens. The protagonists also end up doing this but it varies from game to game.
    -   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky_ has the protagonists Estelle and Joshua Bright who start out as Junior Bracers in the Bracer Guild and work their way up in the ladder.
    -   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero and Trails to Azure_ has the Special Support Section, a branch of the police who are emulating the ways of the Bracer Guild branch at Crossbell to win back the citizens, who see the police as ineffectual and corrupt.
    -   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel_ doesn't really have a group but Olivert, after his experiences in Liberl, decided to emulate the bracers way of thinking by having one class in a military school consist of both nobles and commoners to see if they can lead the way for both classes to work together. Of course, it helps that the Bracer Guild doesn't have a branch in the Erebonia Empire due to the events that happened back in the _Sky games_.
    -   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak_ has the Spriggan occupation with Van Arkride being one such person who has an office called the "Arkride Solutions Office" (even though his employees just decided to join him on a whim without his consent). Unlike the Bracer Guild, Spriggans are notorious for accepting requests that can skirt along the line and even break some laws.
-   _Jagged Alliance_: Downplayed. A.I.M. ends up on the side of the good guys a lot of the time, but it is implied that the organisation cultivates this image after the events of the first game (securing production of hugely valuable medicine) gave them a lot of good press. Also, several mercenaries comment that it is nice to work for the good guys. However, this doesn't change the fact that A.I.M. is an organisation of mercenaries and their members expect to be paid handsomely for their services, or that several members of the organisation have worked for some pretty damn unsavory people.

-   Tagon's Toughs from _Schlock Mercenary_. When confronted with an angry pacifist, Captain Tagon responds:
    
    **Tagon:** But they're almost always bad guys, and we only do it for the money.
    
-   Quentyn from _Tales of the Questor_. As "Questor" is essentially something of a cross between a community champion and a sword for hire.
-   The titular Revenant Braves in _Circumstances of the Revenant Braves_.
-   _The Dragon Doctors_, a group of the best magical doctors in their respective specialities whose mission is to help people (charging if the patient can pay; being sponsored to help those who can't) suffering from mundane to magical ailments. Given the prevalence of magic in the setting, this lets to their involvement with demons, fast-evolving parasites, assassins, a criminal organization of gender-benders, shamanic serial killers, etc.
-   The N-M-S from _Sam & Fuzzy_, owned, headed and led by the protagonist duo. They're... Not very successful.
-   The Help Service from _Hell(p)_. In accord with the rather cynical setting, they are Only in It for the Money.

    Web Original 

-   _Fire Emblem on Forums_:
    -   _Demon Soul Saga_: The philosophy of the Helper's Club and its president, Saya Akitsuki. If you make a request on the billboard in front of their club room, the club will do its best to fulfil it, and their general audience are, well, those in need of help.
-   In _The Gamer's Alliance_, the Union Workers do this, shielding people who have nowhere else to go.
-   The Knights of Fandom try to do this for users of Tumblr who are left feeling helpless by anonymous hate messages (and other circumstances).
-   Given that _Critical Role_ centers around a group of nerdy-ass voice actors playing Dungeons & Dragons, several adventures involve the protagonists being hired to fulfill some task.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: While trying to prepare for the final battle against Fire Lord Ozai and fighting his forces across the globe, the Avatar and his friends will always stop to help those in need.
-   _Ben 10_ lives and stands by this trope. He will anyone in need, whether Alien or Human.
-   _Adventure Time_: Finn makes it a personal point to help anyone in need.
-   _Kim Possible_: From babysitting to saving the world, "she can do anything".
-   The Disney animated show _The Weekenders_ has a charity organization called "Helpers Helping the Helpless," where helpful helpers help helpless people needing help. Description courtesy of the lady in charge losing her thesaurus (she finds it later). Not _quite_ this trope, but the name is there.
-   In the Disney show _Mighty Ducks: The Animated Series_. The one with alien crime fighting duck people. The squad of commando ducks is pursuing a warlord from their world named Dragaunus to earth. While searching for him, they come across crime around every corner, but choose to ignore it, since Dragaunus is their top priority. It's not until the former thief of the group gives them a speech, about how if they continue to allow crime to prosper, then they are equally responsible. It's after this speech that they devote themselves to fighting crime in the city, while searching for Dragonis.
    
    It's not our problem.  
    If we don't fight evil wherever we find it, then were no better than Dragaunus.
    
-   _The Real Ghostbusters_ have been hired by everyone from a pair of young children and a kindly old lady to a Hollywood studio, NASA and the French and Japanese governments. Thankfully, they take that into account when deciding what to charge the customer.
-   _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_ have the motto "No case too big, no case too small" in their theme song. And they appear to follow that principle...
-   Most incarnations of _Scooby-Doo_, whose teenage heroes, a roaming, freelance detective agency in later versions, stumble into just about every paranormal situation imaginable on a weekly basis and take it upon themselves to help the people they've met and debunk the (usually) fake ghost.
-   Jack from _Samurai Jack_ is an example of this, helping everyone he met in his journey and fighting evil in general. Unfortunately, a major conflict with this is that he feels compelled to help anyone in need even at the expense of his journey to find a way home.
-   _Wander over Yonder_ is all about this trope, with lending a helping hand being Wander's modus operandi. "The Wanders" states that he does it so much because he knows what it's like to be in that situation.
-   Parodied with _Smiling Friends_, where it's the main job of the characters to make people smile. This causes them to get into all sorts of wacky zany misadventures. As an example, the very first episode outright hits them with having to help someone so far gone he's got a gun aimed at his head and refuses to put it away.
