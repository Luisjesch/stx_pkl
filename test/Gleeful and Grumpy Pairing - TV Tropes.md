What happens when you combine The Pollyanna and The Cynic? You get a Gleeful And Grumpy Pairing. Often a source of comedy wherein the gleeful character gets the grumpy character into wacky situations that the former never would have thought of. But they can also be a great source of heartwarming moments, where the optimist can bring out the best in the grump... Or it could backfire, and the grump could bring out the worst in the optimist.

A Sub-Trope of Odd Couple and Red Oni, Blue Oni. Compare Cynic–Idealist Duo (where the dichotomy of the characters comes from their externalized worldviews, rather than internalized personalities), Tomboy and Girly Girl, Sensitive Guy and Manly Man, Rude Hero, Nice Sidekick. Sister trope to (and known to overlap with) Ham and Deadpan Duo and Straight Man and Wise Guy. Smart Jerk and Nice Moron can also, and almost always does overlap with this trope, difference being the duo contrast in intelligence as well as temperament.

-   The European Disney Ducks Comic Universe has this dynamic with cousins Fethry (gleeful) and Donald (grumpy).

Joey is more optimistic and excitable, while Chandler is more snarky and pessimistic but not _that_ grumpy, and he and Joey often share enthusiasm for the same things.

    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_:
        -   Downplayed and played with Harry Kim and his best friend Tom Paris in the early seasons.

        -   Tom and B'Elanna also become a bit like this when they get married, since she's short-tempered as mentioned, while he's become a bit more of a jokey goofball by that point.
        -   As Tom became less serious and Harry matured, they were each often paired in this way with Tuvok. As a Vulcan security officer, Tuvok was as deadpan/emotionless and serious as they come, juxtaposed against either human officer's happier and more friendly disposition

    Toys 

-   BIONICLE: Kopaka, especially early on, is a grumpy, lone wolf type with a bit of a Jerkass streak. Meanwhile Pohatu is gregarious, cheerful, and does his best to try to get along with everybody.

    Video Games 

-   In the _Animal Crossing_ series, The pelican sisters that run the Post Office, Pelly and Phyllis, are this.

Banjo will try to make pleasant conversation with everyone he meets, even if they're a boss character who's about to try to kill him, whereas Kazooie is very rude and snarky, often getting herself and Banjo into trouble, as several of the bosses wouldn't have fought them (and, in case of Nipper, would be willing to help) if not for her insults.
-   In _Dragon Age II_, Hawke's younger twin siblings Bethany and Carver fall into this.

-   Sora and Riku from _Kingdom Hearts_, especially more noticeable after the latter's Heel–Face Turn. Sora is a energetic and kindhearted hero who is always with a bright smile on his face and with a cheerful attitude, and uses light-related abilities. Riku is calm and composed, but also very troubled and brooding due to his past experiences, as such he doesn't smile very often and uses dark-related abilities. This is also reflected in their clothing and hair color and style, with Riku's color palette and appearance always having a much more bleak and dark appearance compared to Sora (save for _III_, where Sora is wearing all black with red highlights while Riku wears a much cheerier palette).
-   In _Soma Spirits_, the main duo is Heart, the gleeful guardian of the World of Joy, while his brother Soul is the grumpy guardian of the World of Sorrow.

-   Played with a few times in _RWBY_:
    -   Played straight and later averted when, during initiation, the energetic and pure-hearted goofball Ruby Rose is teamed with the rude, sassy, grumpy Weiss Schnee. However, as the series progresses, Weiss gradually lets down her guard to become her own sophisticated level of cheerful and friendly, and Ruby learns when to be more serious when she needs to be.
    -   Downplayed and also later averted with partners Blake Belladonna and Yang Xiao Long, who were also partnered during initiation; Blake, though generally friendly, starts off incredibly pessimistic, reserved, and gloomy, and Yang is an optimistic, high-energy jokester. Both of them come to terms with their tragic pasts, leading to Blake becoming more open and happy and Yang learning how to become more calm and understanding.
    -   Nora Valkyrie and Lie Ren, childhood friends, initiation partners, and romantic interests with each other at first downplay this trope, with Nora being a hyperactive, optimistic chatterbox and Ren being quiet and reserved, though still friendly and helpful. However, after a series of tragedies and rifts, Ren grows into much more of a grump, becoming a bitter pessimist that, though still in love with Nora (who has maintained her optimism and general eccentricity), leaves both of them with conflicted feelings about each other.

    Webcomics 

-   _Batman: Wayne Family Adventures_: Skylar, Damian's friend from art class, is a bubbly Cheerful Child; Damian is a rough-edged Heroic Comedic Sociopath. Stephanie isn't actually sure how it works; she and Tim theorize that Skylar may secretly be a Kent because they're the only family that can tolerate a Wayne's typical grouchiness long-term.
-   _Pixie and Brutus_: Pixie, a naïve kitten, rarely feels sad or notes anything nasty about events in her life (though the latter changes slightly during strips in which she's older). Brutus, a Shell-Shocked Veteran, experienced a lot of horrible things during his career and maintains a gruff and occasionally hostile stance even after becoming a civilian pet. However, he slowly unbends under Pixie's influence.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, a filler strip inverts this with Grace (or someone in the form of Grace) filling the role of the grumpy quiet calm one while Susan (or someone in the form of Susan) fills the role of the gleeful excitedly playful one.
-   Gabe and Tycho of _Penny Arcade_ have this dynamic. Gabe is a cheerful, excitable goofball, while Tycho is a moody, cynical bore.
-   In _Questionable Content_, Faye, a recovering alcoholic, becomes this with her robot co-worker Bubbles, who's a former military droid and something of a Shell-Shocked Veteran (it's complicated, however.) Faye's troubles in the past have mostly come from her preference for numbing herself with booze and not talking to others about her problems, so she takes it on herself to be Bubbles' cheerful friend and confidante, not entirely to Bubbles' unalloyed pleasure to begin with. However, it works out in the end: they become close friends and, eventually, lovers.
-   Zimmy the Crow and Stretch-Web Ant in _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ are this, with Zimmy constantly serious and grouchy, while Stretch grins, cracks jokes, and does silly things with his Rubber Man powers.
-   Alex and Ethan in _Immaterial_, not quite to the point of Manic Pixie Dream Girl, but she's a fairly impulsive Plucky Girl who brings the clinically depressed, cautious Deadpan Snarker on the wackiest adventure of his life (to date).

    Web Videos 

-   This is the whole gimmick of the _Game Grumps_. Arin is the "grump" and John/Danny is the "not-so-grump." They aren't just pretending to fit into these roles, either, as some of the crew's most famous (near) rage quits come from Arin. John, the original not-so-grump, is consistently a jokester while Danny, the second not-so-grump, is famously chill even when he gets angry at a game.
-   _I'm a Marvel... And I'm a DC_: The pairing of serious-but-justice-oriented Rorschach and the psychopathic Deadpool became a meme, resulting in the creation of several buddy cop videos.
-   _The Nostalgia Critic_ regular Hyper Fangirl's sheer enthusiasm for fandom often contrasts against Critic's grumpy, snarky attitude, particularly in episodes like "Old Vs. New: Spider-Man" when she vehemently defends films she loves that Critic mocks as bad. Sometimes Critic brings her in to have a more positive opinion to contrast against his, and other times she scares him too much for him to protest against her fangirling (or she literally kidnaps him).
-   _Sanders Sides_:
    -   Patton (Morality) is generally the gleeful one to Virgil's (Anxiety) grumpy one when they interact. Where Patton is Thomas's heart, and thus is the heart of the Sides, Virgil is the gloomy Goth personification of Thomas's anxiety. While Virgil initially acts antagonistic towards Thomas and the other Sides, Patton's friendliness softens Virgil over time, and Patton eventually starts calling Virgil his son, which Virgil (mostly) appreciates (even though they are technically the same age).
    -   Patton and Roman (Creativity) also often act as the gleeful ones to Logan (Logic) when Logan is being particularly stubborn and serious.
-   Bowser Junior and Chef Pee Pee from _SuperMarioLogan_ have this respective dynamic. Junior loves making Chef Pee Pee play games with him, take him to fun places, and cook food for him. Chef Pee Pee, however, hates having to look after Junior, especially because it's one of the many responsibilities that Bowser gives him.
-   The Schue-Horyn twins of _Wayward Guide for the Untrained Eye_ often have this dynamic, where pragmatic, serious Intrepid Reporter Artemis is often frustrated by her laid-back brother's puns and wild theories. When those theories start looking more and more likely, however...
-   Nana and TT from _Cream Heroes_ qualify. Nana is a greatly loving and friendly orange cat who loves to rub around and snuggle up to other cats while TT is a grouchy grey tabby who prefers her own company. Somehow they've become good friends.

-   _BoJack Horseman_:

BoJack is a snarky, depressed washed-up sitcom star who tends to see the worst in the world due to his harsh upbringing, while Mr. Peanutbutter is a ridiculously peppy former sitcom star who constantly finds success without even trying and treats BoJack like his best friend despite the latter wanting nothing to do with Mr. Peanutbutter. They also double as a Cynic–Idealist Duo.
    -   BoJack is also contrasted against his roommate Todd, a cheerful slacker who constantly has wacky ideas that get on BoJack's nerves. However, BoJack's cynical, overly judgmental attitude often makes Todd feel less confident, and part of his story arc is learning to break away from BoJack.
    -   Deconstructed with Mr. Peanutbutter and Diane's marriage. While Diane is chronically depressed and always sees the worst in the world (Sarah Lynn even compares her to Daria at one point), Mr. Peanutbutter is very loving and tries to get Diane to have fun, such as by throwing her an incredible surprise birthday party. However, Diane gets frustrated that Mr. Peanutbutter expresses his love in such grandiose ways despite her constantly insisting that she doesn't like that sort of thing, while Mr. Peanutbutter gets offended that Diane never appreciates his optimistic worldview and keeps getting involved in very depressing and risky causes. This inability to reconcile their attitudes eventually leads to their divorce.
-   _Bonkers_: The titular character and Lucky Piquel have this respective dynamic. The duo are a pair of cops who work together to solve crimes in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California.

    -   The kids (Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Webby), are, of course, kids, making them more playful and innocent than their grouchy uncle. It even rubs off a little on him as he warms up to them.
    -   Launchpad McQuack, Scrooge's personal pilot/muscle, possesses extreme patience and almost always looks on the brighter side. His kookiness and Scrooge's temper means the older duck spends a lot of screen time yelling and snarking at him, despite the Interclass Friendship between them.
-   _DuckTales_:
    -   Snarky Lena initially befriends gleeful Webby for less-than-honest reasons as part of her Aunt Magica's evil plot to get to Scrooge McDuck. But Webby's unconditional love and self-sacrifice lead Lena to reject this plan.

-   _Hilda_:
    -   Downplayed with Hilda and Frida. Hilda is a fearless adventurer girl who loves the outdoors and Frida, while friendly, is The Perfectionist and Control Freak who becomes a nervous wreck and loses her temper when things don't go her way. Becomes a deconstruction when it ends up causing a Plot-Mandated Friendship Failure between them. When they reconciled with each other, it became a reconstruction; Frida learned that she doesn't have to be perfect, while Hilda learned to take things into consideration.
    -   Following the Plot-Mandated Friendship Failure mentioned above, Frida has this dynamic with Kelly who is grumpy and cynical, in contrast with her affable and sociable personality. It becomes a deconstruction when it's clear that Kelly is only trying to befriend Frida in an attempt to turn her into a Marra, so when the attempt fails she resorts to pushing her towards the Black Hound in order to save her own skin.
    -   In season 2, Hilda seems to have this dynamic with her mother, Johanna albeit downplayed as well. While friendly herself, Johanna ends up getting upset about Hilda keeping her in the dark about her adventures that she grounds her as a result.

    -   Mindy and Mitchell's relationship directly mirrors Jet and Sean's. Mindy is a Cheerful Child who is enthusiastic and curious about everything.

    -   Ned Flanders and Homer Simpson have this respective dynamic. Ned is very jovial and kind, even when he is being mistreated, and has two well-behaved children. Homer abhors Ned out of jealousy for both his good lifestyle and popularity, as well as Ned's insufferably pious and goody-goody demeanor. Homer is also quick to get angry, especially when his three children (particularly Bart) misbehave.

-   _Thomas & Friends_:
    -   Sodor's two medium-sized tender engines, Edward and James have this dynamic. Edward is kind and patient, and doesn't mind what work he does, whereas James is vain and temperamental, hates doing jobs that are dirty, and prefers pulling coaches.
    -   Sodor's two express engines, Rebecca and Gordon, also have this dynamic, perhaps best exemplified in "Gordon and Rebecca, Coming Through!". Gordon has been working on Sodor for a very long time, loves to go fast, hates pulling goods trains, and is sometimes bossy to the other engines, especially if they're on his tracks, whereas Rebecca came to Sodor much later than Gordon, loves to travel at her own pace, doesn't mind pulling goods trains, and is very polite to the other engines, often letting them go ahead of her.
    -   The two engines who work on the Arlesburgh/Harwick branch line, Ryan and Daisy, also have this respective dynamic. Ryan is a cheerful and hard-working tank engine who is kind to everyone he meets and doesn't mind what work he does. Daisy, on the other hand, is a classy, sassy diesel railcar who prefers to do just what work she chooses and no more. She spends a lot of her time resting in her shed, doesn't like pulling coaches or trucks, and is particularly rude to coaches like Annie, Clarabel, and Henrietta.
    -   Salty the Dockyard Diesel and Cranky the Crane have this respective dynamic whenever they work at Brendam Docks. Salty is a cheerful diesel who enjoys working by the sea and telling tales of the sea to the engines who visit.
