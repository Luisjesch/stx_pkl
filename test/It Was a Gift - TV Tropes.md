How to indicate something The Hero owns is cool, or important, or plot-significant — there are a lot of ways, but one of the most common is to make it a gift from another character. Two birds with one stone, since it can delineate character, and the relationship between two of them, as well as play up the importance of this object. If it is part of the Back Story, often the character will relate it with great pride, which makes a good Framing Device. Even an otherwise useless gift may help you on your quest. It can also be used to disguise the MacGuffin's plot-device status (particularly the Memento MacGuffin) or to introduce Chekhov's Gun in a subtle way.

May also explain an incongruous possession.

The Powers That Be make the most impressive sources, but ordinary characters can serve. Mentors, Anonymous Benefactors, the Reasonable Authority Figure, and parents are likely to present such an item, which may be a physical manifestion of So Proud of You — as is the dead little sister. When the gift comes from an equal, it is likely to be reciprocal, often marking Fire-Forged Friends. It is not unknown for them to have strings that only become evident later.

Ancestral Weapon sometimes falls into this, but only if the character was particularly chosen to receive or inherit the weapon. The Cool Sword is particularly likely to be a gift. Partly, no doubt, because there are so many Cool Swords out there. Take Up My Sword and Passing the Torch often involve such a gift, a concrete expression of what is being passed on. The Lady's Favour is a subtrope.

Note there is no reason why it can't be an Evil Weapon. Or under a curse or any number of unpleasant things.

Contrast Give Me a Sword, which is temporary — though it may convert into this after the fight is over. Super-Trope of Supernatural Aid. See Ancestral Weapon and Protective Charm for common gifts.

Not to be confused with The Gift, or GIFT.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Bleach_: Orihime Inoue's hairpins, which double as Tragic Keepsakes since they were a gift of her dead older brother. When she grows some more, she uses them as lapel decorations instead.
-   _CLANNAD_: When Ushio is looking for the lost toy robot she just recently got from her father Tomoya, he suggests that he could buy her a new one. But she refuses and tells him that it is the first gift she ever got from him. At this moment, Tomoya finally realizes his bond with his daughter and how much he loves her.
-   _Code Geass R2_: Rolo's heart-shaped locket charm on his cellphone was a birthday present from his fake older brother Lelouch. Despite being a ridiculously girly gift (Lelouch was thinking of his real sister Nunnally when he got it), Rolo refuses to part with it and is extremely protective and sentimental about it.
-   _Digimon Tamers_: Impmon is gifted a toy gun by his partners to help him in the fight against the D-Reaper. Impmon takes it even though he knows it won't be much help, but at the same time he is so moved by the gesture and their restored bond that he unlocks a new evolution in Beelzemon Blast Mode, turning the toy gun into a powerful weapon called Blaster.
-   Played with in the 2006 anime adaptation of _Fate/stay night_. On their date, Shirou takes Saber to a stuffed animal store and after she angrily stomps off upset when it seems that he's judging her for finding a lion doll cute, he buys it for her. Due to other pressing matters, he never gets the chance to give it to her and the anime closes on a shot of the lion doll sitting on the desk of Saber's bedroom.
-   _Gunslinger Girl_
    -   While not as largely plot-impacting as the rest of the things from this page, it can be seen in a few chapters that Rico has a cuddling pillow given by her handler Jean. Considering the cold, aloof fish that Jean is, it seems out-of-character for him to give her something like that, until we see in a flashback that Enrica has one too, likely a gift from her Aloof Big Brother. This serves to show us cracks in Jean's Jerkass Façade.
    -   Triela has this attitude to the weapons issued by her handler Hilshire. She doesn't react well when her pistol is taken off her by Pinocchio, and when Hilshire suggests upgrading to a more modern shotgun she refuses to give up her Winchester trench gun, even though thanks to her increasing memory loss she can no longer remember where she got it.

    -   Subaru mentions in Sound Stage N for the first movie that Cinque's most prized possessions are a pair of step stools that their father made for her.
    -   Vivio's Sacred Heart in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid_ is a gift from her Nanoha-mama after she had deemed her skilled enough at using magic.

    -   In the backstory of _ViVid Strike!_, Rinne's adoptive mother gave her a tiepin for good luck on her first day of school that she became particularly attached to, especially once she found out that it was a family heirloom. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by bullies on the day her grandfather died, and -much like with Vivio's bunny- it served as the design basis for her Transformation Trinket.

-   _Only the Flower Knows_: Misaki's flower necklace turns out to be a gift from Kawabata, so he can look at it and remember someone is there for him after his grandfather's death. He appreciates the sentiment, and also has feelings for Kawabata, so he wears it every day under his shirt.

-   _Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun:_ Just prior to the second year starting for the Misfit Class, a group of thirteen students including the titular Iruma who went from roughians and troublemakers to being one of the strongest, most devious, and popular classes, and achieving many things that even one would be worthy of high praise, are gifted a trinket. These vary from earings, headbands, and so on. They come from the special tutors they had, family members, and a high ranking retired demon. These are given to celebrate these young demons and Iruma's growth as well as mark them as skilled and dangerous demons who these gift-givers believe have even greater potential.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, Solomon Muto has one of only four copies of the legendary Blue-Eyes White Dragon, given to him as a gift from Arthur Hawkins after Solomon saved Arthur's life.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Dark City_. Subverted in that it's probably just a prop assigned to him by the Strangers; his memories of it being a gift are fake.
    
    **Inspector Frank Bumstead:** _It was a gift from my mother. She died recently. I keep it with me to remind me of her._

But in a deleted scene Gimli talks about his gift - Galadriel wasn't sure what to give him, so he asked for a single strand of hair from her head, and she gave him three. Legolas's surprised smile, and Gimli's satisfied tone, make this a rather heartwarming scene - especially if the viewer is familiar with the origin of the Silmarils.
    -   Earlier, the trope is invoked when Aragorn - prior to setting out with the Fellowship - attempts to return the Evenstar pendant which Arwen had given him as a sign of her intention to choose a mortal life with him. She's hurt by the action and tells him, "It was a gift. Keep it."

At the end of the book this proves to be symbolic, because Taran faces Dorath again, this time fighting with a sword Taran had forged himself, and when the two swords meet, it is the sword of his childhood that shatters.

    -   Similarly, in _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_, Dumbledore leaves Harry the Sword of Gryffindor in his will; sure enough, this and Dumbledore's other bequests play roles of varying significance. Also significant are Harry's seventeenth birthday presents: the traditional watch had belonged to a dead member of the Order of the Phoenix, Molly's brother, and Ginny's kiss — to be easy to carry — makes it clear that she's going to wait, even though she knows he's going into danger.

    -   The Invisibility Cloak was also a gift, as was the Marauder's Map, both of which were indispensable to many of his adventures.

-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_ has a number of swords like this. Usually these are Ancestral Weapons and in many cases such gifts become Take Up My Sword, but a few don't fall under either category:
    -   Very early in the first book, Jon has a small sword tailor made for Arya, Needle. It becomes her most valuable and prized possession.
    -   Jon gets one himself after saving the life of Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont gives Jon his valuable heirloom Longclaw and has the bear, the sigil of house Mormont, on the pommel carved into a wolf, the sigil of house Stark (specifically designed to resemble Jon's direwolf Ghost). The criteria of Take Up My Sword isn't fulfilled until some books later.
    -   In a non-sword example, Tyrion Lannister, who has been taking being kidnapped pretty well up to that point, really begins to lose his temper when the Stark soldiers decide to eat his horse. It was a birthday present from his brother.
    -   Illyrio Mopatis gives Daenerys Targaryen three dragon eggs as her wedding gift. Those eggs are going to be _very_ important later on.
    -   Deconstructed in the backstory. King Aegon IV Targaryen is remembered as one of the worst kings Westeros ever had, especially for his tendency to really get around and consequently father dozens of bastards. His favourite child was his bastard son Daemon, because he was Targaryen on both sides, handsome and strong, and extremely skilled with a sword. It was to him that he gave the Targaryen family sword Blackfyre, instead of to his legitimate son Daeron, a Bookworm, whom he suspected of being his wife's bastard with their brother Aemon. Since the sword is traditionally passed down to the heir to the throne, some took this as a sign that Aegon wanted his bastard Daemon (who took the surname Blackfyre after the sword) to inherit instead of Prince Daeron. This, combined with many other factors, led to a rebellion in which Daemon and his followers attempted to seize the throne. When he was killed and his army defeated, his sons and supporters took the sword with them into exile. They continued to try to seize the throne for another 80 years before the last Blackfyre was killed in the final invasion and the sword was lost.

Not only that, they are particularly useful to a girl in knight-training. Among them are magical bruise balm, exercise equipment to strengthen her arms, a saddle for her horse, and a new knife and matching sword. The "mysterious benefactor" turns out to be Sir Alanna, the first lady knight, who presumably, as the sole heir of two large estates, has money to burn. It's implied that these gifts are things Alanna wished she had as a page/squire. An exceptionally notable and heartwarming payment was when Kel got to keep Peachblossom for _four years._
    -   Alanna herself has her own gift: the mirror with roses on it that her oldest son gave her when he was little. She still uses it to scry twelve years later.
-   In _The Treachery of Beautiful Things_, Jenny's necklace with the heart-shaped locket.
-   _Vorkosigan Saga_:
    -   In _Shards of Honor_, Cordelia finds Aral in a drunken stupor and a colorful tropical shirt. The shirt turns out to be a gift from the men who served with him at a former post, most of whom are dead.
    -   In _A Civil Campaign_, Miles shows Ekaterin the scalps in the attic — presumably presented to his grandfather by his subordinates. As they are presents, doing anything with them is complicated.
-   _Warhammer 40,000 Expanded Universe_ novels:
    -   _Horus Heresy_
        -   In _False Gods_, Horus carries a golden sword, forged for him by a battle brother when he was made Warmaster.
        -   In _Fulgrim_, Ferrus Manus carries a golden sword. When he had first met his brother primarch Fulgrim, they had challenged each other, and Fulgrim had made the sword, while Ferrus Manus made a warhammer. Astounded by the other's skills, they had given each other the weapons they had made to seal their friendship. When Fulgrim fails to sway him to Horus's side, they fight, and Ferrus Manus breaks the sword, making Fulgrim realize that the break is irrevocable. Fulgrim takes back the warhammer and has his ships open fire on the Iron Hands.
    -   The _Space Wolf_ novel _Wolfblade_ recounts a story that, among other things, tells how Ragnar got his frostblade. Indeed, in the Frame Story, explaining it is the motive for telling the story.
    -   In the Backstory of Simon Spurrier's _Lord of the Night_, the Night Haunter had named Sahaal his heir and decreed that he should receive the _Corona Nox_ as a symbol of that, which was why it's being lost was so important.
    -   In _Dawn of War II_, the governor tries to justify having the Space Marine sword Wisdom by claiming it was a gift. It doesn't save him.
    -   In _Gaunt's Ghosts_, Ibram Gaunt's swords are both gifts. His first came from the hand of his dead mentor, General-Commissar Oktar. When it is ruined in battle, he receives the power sword of Hieronymo Sondar, the founder of Vervunhive, while he tries to defend it in _Necropolis_, and carries that sword thereafter.
    -   In _The Carrion Thone_ by Chris Wraight, Interrogator Spinoza's prized possession is her Crozius Arcanum. This was gifted to her by a Chaplain when she once had an assignment with Space Marine chapter, the Imperial Fists. Not only did Chaplain Erastus give her his personal scrimshawed, bone-encased sacred weapon, he had it resized for her human hands and trained her how to use the still massive weapon effectively. This gift and extra services are especially generous as Space Marines and the Inquisition normally don't get along.
-   In _The Wide-Awake Princess_, Gwendolyn is showered with gifts for her sixteenth birthday. One of them the fatal spinning wheel.
-   In _A Wrinkle in Time_, Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which give the children gifts before sending them off, which proves crucial.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Used in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_. Tara offers Willow a dolls-eye crystal that belonged to her grandmother, but Willow refuses on the grounds that it's a valuable family heirloom. But after they spend the night "casting spells", Willow turns up at her dorm the following morning holding the crystal, implying that she accepted it as a love token.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Jon Snow has a small rapier specially made as a parting gift for his little sister Arya, which becomes the only part of her old life she retains by the end of the season.
    -   Jon gets one himself after saving the life of Lord Commander Mormont. In gratitude, the Lord Commander has his Ancestral Weapon Longclaw remade and presents it to Jon.
    -   Brienne receives the sword Oathkeeper and a new set of armor as a gift from Jaime Lannister.
-   _The Little Drummer Girl_: Charlie's bracelet, which Gadi gave her (which is pretended to be from Salim as part of her cover).
-   Parodied in _Scrubs_. JD is excited at being invited to the birthday party of Dr. Cox and Jordan's son before he's reminded that he's only being allowed in because he has a Spongebob costume. JD hastily defends it with, "It was a gift," before adding in his narration, "From me to me."
-   In _Supernatural_, the pendant that Dean _always_ wears around his neck was a gift from his brother Sam, who gave it to him to show that Sam considered Dean more of a parent than their father John (the pendant was originally to be a Christmas gift for their father). "Always", that is, until season five, when it turns out to be a tool for locating God, and he _reluctantly_ lends it to Castiel.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Greek Mythology: Perseus was given his sword, his mirror-like shield, and winged sandals by Athena and Hermes.
-   Excalibur is sometimes said to be a gift from The Lady of the Lake to King Arthur.
-   In the _Saga of the Volsungs_, Odin appears at the wedding of Signy and King Siggeir and drives a sword into the tree Barnstokk, and only Signy's brother Sigmund could pull it out.

    Theater 

-   In _A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum_, a set of three rings showing a gaggle of geese (at least seven), given by a father to his two children, stolen in infancy by pirates, play an important part in the denouement.
-   _The Merchant of Venice_: One of Shylock's most notable human moments is buried in his 'wicked old miser-Jew' ranting about how his daughter, who recently eloped with an enemy of his, taking all his money and jewels with her, were dead if it meant he could have his riches back—the scene is a friend of his reporting her progress across the Mediterranean, and he gets especially vitriolic after finding out that Jessica traded the turquoise ring for a pet monkey. Turns out that particular ring was a gift from his dead wife, before they married. In fairness to Jessica, she probably didn't know this.
-   The silver candlesticks in _Les Misérables_ represent Jean Valjean's holiness and ongoing quest to be a good man. They were first given to him by the Bishop in the aptly named "Proluge/The Bishop", after he stole the rest of the Bishop's silver. The fact that the Bishop lied to the police by confirming Valjean's claim that the silver was a gift from the Bishop, and that the Bishop gave him _more_ in addition to what he had already taken, is what sets Valjean on the path of righteousness.
-   _Wicked_ has Elphaba's hat, which actually _wasn't_ meant as a sincere gift at first. Galinda, before she was Glinda the Good, or even friends with Elphaba, received an ugly black hat from a non-fashion-conscious relative and regifted it to Elphaba to wear to the party thinking she'd be humiliated. When she was able to stand out in a positive way instead, she and Galinda started warming up to each other, and during the entire time they were friends and after they parted, Elphaba kept the hat and it became her Iconic Item as the Wicked Witch.

    Video Games 

-   The "Vampire Killer" whip from _Castlevania_ series is given to the Morris family sometime during early 19th century and stays with them until the year 1999 as a keepsake before the next rightful owner of the Belmont Clan appears. John and Jonathan use it anyway to deal with certain threats that wish to bring back Dracula prematurely.
-   _Devil May Cry_:
    -   For the twins, Yamato and Rebellion to Vergil and Dante respectively, are passed down by Sparda. Their mother Eva also gave them their own halves of the Perfect Amulet.
    -   Midway through _Devil May Cry 4_, Nero is already in possession of the Yamato (the katana that Sparda and Vergil once used), but he still asks Dante to let him keep the sword to fight with, as he needs it in order to save Kyrie. In the finale of the game, Dante lets Nero keep the sword permanently as a gift "worth giving" when Nero tries to return it to its rightful owner, Dante. Of course, Dante merely wants it to "stay in the family", and the revelation in _Devil May Cry 5_ retroactively means he already realized that Nero deserves the Yamato during their second fight in _DMC4_.
-   The incongruous possession variant occurs in _Eternal Sonata_ — if you have Retto explore Viola's bedroom, he finds a teddy bear, which strikes him as odd. Then he spots the gift tag.
-   _Final Fantasy_
    -   As is eventually revealed in _Final Fantasy VII_, the Buster Sword was a gift from a dying Zack to Cloud, which sort of explains why it can never be sold (polygonal limitations explains the rest). In _Crisis Core_, the Buster Sword was a gift from a dying Angeal to Zack, who then used it exclusively (but only the blunt side, in order to "prevent wear, tear, and rust"). Even before _that_, the Buster Sword was a gift from Angeal's very poor parents to Angeal when he joined SOLDIER after the weapon was forged.
        -   Mentioned briefly in _Dissidia Final Fantasy_:
            
            **Cloud:** It's not heavy, it's a memento.
            
    -   Tidus of _Final Fantasy X_ also had his signature weapon, the Brotherhood, as a gift from Wakka, who originally made it for his dead little brother Chappu, who coincidentally (and remarkably) resembled Tidus. Chappu's refusal to use the weapon was something of a sore point with Wakka, as Chappu chose to fight with an Al Bhed machina weapon instead, and eventually died fighting Sin.
        -   Tidus also gets a longsword in the beginning from Auron, a "gift" from Jecht. Considering you can sell it as soon as you acquire Brotherhood, it tells you a lot about how Tidus feels about Dad.
-   _Mega Man ZX_ has Livemetal/Biometal Model Z, under the ownership of Giro. When he dies a little later into the game, he entrusts the metal in the hands of his apprentice(s) Vent/Aile. In the sequel _Advent_, they tell Ashe/Grey that it's not theirs, but rather a "memento" from a dear friend.
-   _Odin Sphere_
    -   Gwendolyn's magic spear was given to her by her mortally wounded sister. So it's understandable why she gets upset when she learns her father gave it away to the Shadow Knight, Oswald, as part of a bribe. Luckily, Oswald only wants Gwendolyn's love and is perfectly happy to give the spear back to her.
    -   Oswald also presents Gwendolyn with the magic ring Titrel, describing it as the only gift he has that's worthy of being presented to her. Gwendolyn turns around and delivers the ring directly to her father Odin, who wants it in order to control the Crystallization Cauldron. She's immediately filled with regret when Odin tells her the lengths to which Oswald was willing to go for her sake - even moreso when Oswald finds out and takes it to mean that she has no feelings for him, which sends him over the Despair Event Horizon. Gwendolyn later _storms the fairy kingdom of Ringford single-handed_ to retrieve the ring after it's stolen, and flatly refuses when her father demands that she hand it over, declaring that she'd rather die than part with the token of her husband's love.
-   In _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_, delivering Kofu's wallet ends up counting as an impromptu Gym Trial, since the player was about to challenge him when he ran off and dropped it on the way to an auction. The second half of the DLC reveals that it was a gift from his protogé Katy, which explains why it resembles a Venonat (she uses Bug-Types).
-   Professor Layton's Signature Headgear is a gift from his girlfriend.
-   _Sands of Destruction_ averts this trope with Morte, perhaps as yet another way to mark her as "odd" in comparison to the rest of the team (as if being the Token Evil Team Mate out to destroy the world with great enthusiasm wasn't odd enough).
    -   While Morte's first sword, the Nameless Blade, was given to her by the local blacksmith of the Bacchitav Caravan, she shows no particular attachment to it and is equally happy with any sword; she cares more about the strength of the weapon than where she got it. The blacksmith himself considers it to be an Old Shame and desperately wishes to replace it (which grants you her Infinity -1 Sword if you take him up on his offer), but not because being stuck with an inferior weapon could be dangerous to a fellow Sand Tribe member; he's just worried someone will trace it back to him and think his skills are still as poor as when he forged it. She also has no problems trading in clothes which were given to her by Feral women, though as she had no prior relationship to them, it's not quite as odd.
    -   Played straight by most other characters and various weapons and armor they receive; they're obviously happy to have items of sentimental value as well as practical power. Luckily, the two coincide more often than not.
-   In one of the endings to _Street Fighter Alpha 2_, Ken gives Ryu his famous red headband (which Ken had been previously using as a hair tie). Previous to this, Ryu had been wearing a white headband.
-   Played for Laughs in _Tales of Vesperia_. When Judith meets Yuri, she notices the Sorcerer's Ring (commonly used in the series to solve puzzles) and asks if it was a gift from a girl. When Yuri admits that it was, Judith comments that they must have a "special bond", which causes the 21-year-old Yuri to groan that he hopes not—it was given to him by the Hot-Blooded 15-year-old mage Rita.
-   In "The Champions' Ballad" DLC for _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_, refighting Thunderblight Ganon enough times will have Urbosa's spirit ask Link to give her diary to Zelda once the whole business with Calamity Ganon is over, primarily because she's written down memories of Zelda's mother (including when the Queen first introduced an infant Zelda to Urbosa).
-   In _Atelier Lydie & Suelle: The Alchemists and the Mysterious Paintings_, Ilmeria's atelier is filled with cute plush toys, which she insists were all gifts from other people, though the twins suss out the truth pretty quickly.
-   In the arcade and Arcade Archives versions of _Sunset Riders_, stage 5 has El Greco as the boss, who tosses away his red sombrero as all players head back to their positions. However, if one of the players happens to be Cormando, that player will not return to their position unlike the others; instead, they remain where they were as El Greco says “Adios, amigo.” Then, he will toss the red sombrero in the direction of Cormando, who catches it and swaps the red sombrero with his own, in which the red sombrero remains for the rest of the game.

    Web Animation 

-   _RWBY_: Ironwood groomed Winter's career so that she would be capable of inheriting the Winter Maiden powers, the very thing he wanted her to have. However, when he tries to claim credit for this in Volume 8, she angrily tells him that he chose nothing because she was given a gift. Penny chooses Winter to receive the Winter Maiden powers to protect them from Cinder, because she has faith in her and she considers Winter her friend. Winter's transformation is therefore rooted in Penny's sacrifice, their relationship, and their rejection of everything Ironwood stood for.

    Web Comics 

-   In _The Adventures of Shan Shan_, Cassie has a lunchbox from her Disappeared Dad.
-   In _Alice and the Nightmare_, Alice gets a collar-like necklace with a mirror from her mentor, who tells her that with this, her strength will be Alice's strength. It's as transparent a Chekhov's Gun as any.
-   In the webcomic _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_, Daniel Ti'Fiona long wore a signature robe; in a flashback we finally learn it was given to him by his friend Wildy San when he graduated from Adventurers School.
-   The ring in _Girl Genius_. "Some kind of connector from the gas system turned to a ring by Gil during his abortive marriage proposal, to give to Agatha, worn by Agatha until she needed to fake her death, found by Gil on what appeared to be her body, worn by Gil on a chain about his neck thereafter. She was quite touched when she realized that.
-   _Gunnerkrigg Court_
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   Thanks to time travel shenanigans, John ends up receiving the same present three times, with added modifications each time. The final version (a cybernetically enhanced toy rabbit (the one from _Con Air_, no less) carrying an array of lethal weapons) is both instrumental in the rise of power of the main villain, and John's victory in his first battle against said villain.
    -   At the same time, the presents sent by John to his friends prove instrumental in defining Dave's appearance, Rose's weapon of choice, Jade's liking for wearing blue and gardening, and the very reason that the four kids know each other in the first place.
-   In _Kevin & Kell_, when Rudy graduated from Caliban Academy, he gave his trademark bone necklace to his little sister, Coney.
-   Zoe's chest tattoo in _Sluggy Freelance_ was a necklace given to her by Torg. It was revealed to be cursed the first time it activated and turned her into a camel, bonding to her skin. The necklace was found later as evidence of Zoe's death.
-   _Unsounded_: Matty treasures his hat because his frugal and emotionally distant father gave it to him.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: Katara's necklace, from her grandmother by way of her mother. Important in that it gets stolen partway through the first season, then retrieved again; has plot significance in "The Waterbending Master" as well. Also, "The Avatar State" opens with a gifting scene reminiscent of (and slightly parodying) Galadriel's gifting of the party in _The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring_.
    
    **Master Pakku:** _(in a serious and ceremonial manner)_ Katara, I want you to have this. _(cut to a close-up of the amulet, showing that it is a triangle with a wave-shaped pattern of blue color with a crescent moon on the top.)_ This amulet contains water from the Spirit Oasis. _(cut to behind Master Pakku as he hands the amulet to Katara, who is standing in front of Appa and next to Aang)_ The water has unique properties. Don't lose it. _(his face softens)_  
    **Katara:** _(respectfully)_ Thank you, Master Pakku. _(she embraces him and then walks off screen; Aang steps forward and Master Pakku produces an intricately-decorated brown box)_  
    **Master Pakku:** Aang, these scrolls will help you master waterbending, but remember they're no substitute for a real master.  
    _(Aang looks up at Katara, who is on top of Appa, and then exits to the left as Sokka steps forward)_  
    **Master Pakku:** Sokka. _(Sokka looks at him proudly and expectantly.)_ Take care, son. _(Pakku pats Sokka's arm, giving him nothing; Sokka's expression becomes very dejected and embarrassed)_
    
-   In season 3 of _The Owl House_, it's revealed that part of the reason why Luz is such a big fan of _The Good Witch Azura_ series is because her father gave her the first book shortly before he died and reading it helped her during her grieving period.
-   Inverted in the _SpongeBob SquarePants_ episode "Krab Borg". SpongeBob and Squidward are smashing Mr. Krabs' stuff, and he's screaming about the costs and they get to a blender. Mr. Krabs stops screaming, saying it was a gift, in disregard.
-   Mr. Know-It-All (Bullwinkle J. Moose) shows—and ultimately fails—how to train a monster. When he gives up:
    
    **Rocky:** What are you gonna do with him, Mr. Know-It-All?
    
    **Mr. Know-It-All:** What do you mean what am _I_ gonna do with it? Happy birthday, Rocky!
    
-   _Work It Out Wombats!_: In "Measure for Measure," Ellie loses her hat. Her hat was very important to her because it was a present from her gammy.
