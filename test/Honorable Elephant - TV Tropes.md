Maybe monkeys can get away with lounging on the ground, but elephants must be held to a higher standard.

_I meant what I said, and I said what I meant!_

_An elephant's faithful, one-hundred percent!_

Thanks to its size, the movements of an elephant tend to be slow and ponderous. While it's impossible to know whether an elephant's inner life is more somber and dignified than, say, that of an otter, it certainly _looks_ that way. This impression of elephants is compounded by the fact that elephants are observed engaging in what appears to be reverence for their dead. It seems likely that they are aware of their own mortality, given that when encountering fallen members of their kind, elephants will pause and observe, to the point of picking up and inspecting loose bones they might find. The prodigious memory of elephants also makes it seem that their lives must be more burdened by history and the past than animals with less powerful memories, which exist more "in the moment".

An anthropomorphized elephant or mammoth will typically be honorable and stoic. A young elephant may be more playful, but is unlikely to be a willful troublemaker. Ironically, while in Real Life female elephants tend to be the most involved in the complex social behaviors which make them so easily identified-with, fictitious elephantine heroes tend to be males — perhaps because something so massive and thick-skinned as an elephant seems masculine even when the beast is female.

Some aspects of Real Life elephants, such as their excellent memories, may be portrayed widely in fiction, while other aspects, such as the feeling of Unstoppable Rage and lust males feel during _musth,_ may be played down. Except in the case they encounter dirty rats.

Compare Genial Giraffe, another friendly animal that is often seen together with elephants. The polar opposite of the Cruel Elephant.

    Anime and Manga 

-   In _Aggretsuko_, the president of whatever company the characters work at is an elephant. He's kinda forgetful and a little incompetent, but he's a Nice Guy and a Reasonable Authority Figure, especially when compared to folks like Hog Honcho/Director Ton, Scatherine/Tsubone, and Boss Buffalo/Yagyū. It should be noted, though, that Eaglette/Washimi, one of Retsuko's best friends, is the President's personal secretary, so how much of this is his normal behavior and how much of this is Eaglette pulling strings to help her friend have a good time at work is unknown.

-   _The Jungle Book_: Hathi the elephant, like his book counterpart, is the temperate but righteous leader and lawgiver of the jungle.

    Comic Books 

-   _Green Lantern_: Brother Warth is a member of the Blue Lantern Corps., hand picked by its leader.

    Eastern European Animation 

-   _38 Parrots_: Elephant is shy, bookish and constantly apologizing.
-   _Adventures of Mowgli_: Hatkhi from the Soviet adaptation is a very respected and dignified authority figure, akin to a lawkeeper, and with none of the goofy traits of his Disney counterpart.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Kaiju Revolution_, the Skull Island Mammoths are a species of kaiju-sized mammoth that are generally peaceful and serve an important role in the island's ecosystem by creating large game trails that are utilized by many of the native plants and animals.
-   Martha the mammoth from _Prehistoric Park_ is amongst the animals rescued for the titular park in _Prehistoric Earth_. Much like in the series she's originally from, she's a gentle soul and she even ends up being used to combat against a rogue female t. rex that the story's villains attempt to use to cause chaos at the park for the sake of their own plans.
-   Most of the prehistoric elephants rescued in _Prehistoric Park Reimagined_ prove to be largely friendly and agreeable gentle giants. Martha in particular is every bit the kindly Gentle Giant that she was in the original _Prehistoric Park_ (even managing to sympathize and form a bond with Jerk with a Heart of Gold security chief Nikolai). But just to be safe, all the adult males are largely kept separate from the youngsters and adult females at the park, just in case.
-   In _This Bites!_, Funkfreed (the sword-turned-elephant belonging to Spandam of Cipher Pol 0) comes into the possession of self-insert hero Cross.

    Film — Animated 

-   Tika from _Barbie as the Island Princess_ is a downplayed version. While she is generally sweet-natured and kind, she does have rather bratty moments, such as going out of her way to sabotage Ro and Antonio's relationship.
-   _Dumbo_: The title character is playful but never malicious. The Matriarch invokes this trope ("We elephants have always walked with dignity.") but is actually a Cruel Elephant behind her dignified facade. Mrs. Jumbo plays it straighter, not that it helps her.
-   _Ice Age_: Manny is an honorable mammoth. He feels morally obligated to return a human baby to his family even though he knows that the child could one day grow up to be a mammoth-killer, and although he's grouchy and reclusive at times, he's definitely the most principled and moral of the main characters.
-   In _The Jungle Book (1967)_, Hathi is like an honorable, respectable (if not too bright) British army officer.
-   _Tarzan_: Tantor may be a Cowardly Lion, but when his friends are in danger he overcomes his fear and helps them.

-   _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_: Behemoth — a Kaiju who resembles a cross between a mammoth and a ground sloth — plays with this; he's portrayed as destructive under Ghidorah's command, but later proves to be a docile and beneficial creature once Godzilla takes charge, restoring much of the Amazon rainforest just by walking around. Though only appearing in a few scenes, he's become a fan favourite, in large part for his weird, striking design.
-   _Mowgli_: This incarnation of Hathi is more true to his book counterpart, being a benevolent ruler of the jungle. He saves Mowgli from a tiger pit and later gathers the other elephants to help the boy defeat Shere Khan in return for showing him the hunter who shot part of his tusk off.

And then they have a word with the old man...
-   Stella, the old circus elephant in _The One and Only Ivan_, is good friend with the gorilla Ivan. She's reserved and doesn't have Ivan's willful denial of how bad their situation is, and tells him stories.

He knows she wants Ruby to have a better life somewhere else and promises anyway.
    -   Ivan also has the impression that bull elephants are like silverback gorillas - stoic, dignified, rarely angry except in protection of their families. If Stella knew otherwise, she didn't tell him.

The latter is a forest guardian protecting the environment and defending his own territory, causing Ultraman Great to put him into a Deep Sleep rather than killing it.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   The Bible: A likely candidate for the Behemoth, a biblical creature mentioned in the Book of Job, is the now extinct giant Syrian elephant. Described to show the limits of man's power against God's nature, Behemoth is described as the most powerful land animal on the planet. In particular, the wording used to describe its greatness imply both physical and intellectual might. It's so big it has to use trees for shade and has giant horns/tusks it can gore the Leviathan with — certainly a beast that shouldn't be trifled with. Yet it spends its days peacefully in the fields and swamps, eating grass as the smaller beasts play around it, showing that it's a Gentle Giant herbivore if left in peace.
-   Buddhism: The Buddha was an honorable elephant in several of his previous lives, and the popularity of white elephants in Thailand has to do with Buddha taking the form of a six-tusked white elephant.
-   Hindu Mythology: Played entirely straight, as elephants often symbolize wisdom, grace, power and kingliness. Eight divine elephants carry the world on their backs, and a white four-tusked elephant is the mount of the storm god Indra.

They've also been observed doing the same with dead humans.
