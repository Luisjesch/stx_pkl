    Anime & Manga 

-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: Lippy is an embodiment of desire and pleasure, and one of her powers is "Love Wave", which makes people so sexually-sensitive they'll collapse in ecstasy without any other stimulation. Matsuri could barely even stand to _pull her phone out of her pocket_.
-   This is the special power of the titular character in the Hentai series _Demi the Demoness_. She can fire a bolt that makes the target orgasm so hard that they explode.
-   Larcade from _Fairy Tail_ has the magic power to inflict copious amounts of pleasure on his victims, all but stated to be the sexual kind. Those subjected to it long enough will have their bodies and minds overloaded until they die. The most basic form of this is a widespread spell that only affects those who are heavily implied to have had sex already, though if he bothers to focus it on one person he can induce a similar effect whether they've "tasted the forbidden fruit" or not.
-   In _Torako, Anmari Kowashicha Dame da yo_, Megumu Udou's nickname, Bullet, comes from the fact that she has a vibrator inserted in her at almost all times. Takano holds the switch and turns it on for her from time to time, though sometimes forgets to turn it off, such as in chapter two when doing so nearly causes Bullet to stumble into traffic.

    Comic Books 

-   _Click!_ is a series of erotic Italian comic books written and illustrated by comic book creator Milo Manara. The first volume features an attractive but passionless woman, Ms. Claudia Cristiani, who is married to an older, rich man. After she is abducted by a scientist and a remote-controlled device is surgically implanted into her brain, its activation makes her become sexually insatiable. The three sequels roughly follow a similar story. There was an entire series on Cinemax back in the '90s loosely based on this story.
-   In one issue of _Manhunter_, Kate Spencer's tech guy brags that he could reconfigure her suit to put her in a state of perpetual orgasm if she wanted him to. She declines.
-   Fuji from _Stormwatch_ is an Energy Being who's kept in a containment suit so that he doesn't dissipate into nothingness. Due to the conditions of his suit and the constant buffeting of his nervous system by his own energy, he has an orgasm every five minutes. No wonder he's so happy.
-   The character Orgasm Lass from _XXXenophile_ by Phil Foglio is essentially a living version of this. By touching someone, she can generate intense pleasure in them, triggering an orgasm in any being capable of experiencing one.
-   The French comic _Yiu_ has the titular Action Girl's Mission Control guy use the implants in her brain to give her a mini-orgasm in the middle of a delicate mission. Yiu is not amused.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Captain Proton and the Planet of Lesbians_, the Death Ray of the evil Queen Sapphia is changed via Reverse Polarity to provide Electric Instant Gratification, ending the final battle when everyone experiences a simultaneous orgasm. Proton then gets an irate call from the President of Earth, demanding he arrest the nefarious villain who just shot a sex ray at the United States, starting a nationwide orgy.
-   In Discworld fic shorts by A.A. Pessimal, gathered together as _The Civilian Assistant_, Sam Vimes tetchily demands an explanation of of his Disorganiser Imp is to what this bloody _Vibrate..._ function is actually _for_. Angua von Überwald and Sally von Humperdinck immediately see a use, and make cryptic references as to what _else_ it can be used for. Captain Carrot is seen to frown in bewildered perplexity and ask what possible use a woman can find for something that vibrates so strongly. Angua does the face-palm thing.
    
    Oh, good grief, Carrot...
    
-   In the _Star Trek: Voyager_ Slash Fic _Good Vibrations_, Chief Engineer B'Elanna Torres modifies her sonic shower into an all-over vibrator and has Seven of Nine join her. Warning: NSFW.

    Film — Animated 

-   Since the main villain in _Rock and Rule_ is interested only in Angel, he sidelines her bandmates by having his gloved henchmen issue them "Edison balls," which are luminescent pink spheres that instil giggling euphoria and mindless detachment in their recipients. This effect lingers, even when the guys are put on a bus destined for Ohmtown.
    
    **Angel:** Mok, what have you done to them? They're mindless.  
    **Mok:** Oh? I hadn't noticed.

    Literature 

-   _Animorphs_: Tobias gets hooked up to a machine that stimulates his brain's pain and pleasure regions (in this case, he remembers happy memories like being on a trampoline or eating ice cream). He's able to avoid the worst of it by hiding behind his hawk body's instincts, but was very close to breaking when rescued.
-   The '70s pulp series _The Baroness_ opens with a plot involving a drug that makes the user orgasm. The villain behind it also has followers addicted to Electric Instant Gratification, and plans to get world leaders hooked on his drugs and devices so he can Take Over the World.
-   In _The Gap Cycle_, zone implants are capable of giving orgasms to those in whom they are implanted. Surprisingly, Angus Thermopyle never uses this function on his victim, Morn Hyland, preferring to just render her inert whenever he rapes her.
-   A new device in _A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Dealers_ allows people to experience the dreams of others, including sexual ones.
-   In _Ringworld_, a device called a "tasp" can remotely stimulate the pleasure centers of a being's brain. It is very addictive and use of it on someone without their consent is highly illegal. While it does not explicitly cause orgasm, Nessus (a manipulative alien) uses it to make Prill (a humanoid whose help the protagonists need) addicted to sex with Louis Wu. It is also compared to sex when the narrative muses that "all women have a tasp" that they use to manipulate men to do their bidding.
-   Boyd Upchurch's 1971 _Sex and the High Command_ centers around one. A heavy-handed satire on feminism, it has a female scientist (who is also running for President) inventing an herbal compound called Vita-Lerp. Normally used as a rejuvenating skin cream, when encapsulated and then vaginally inserted, it _not only_ brings about an intense orgasm but also induces pregnancy. Since this makes men intimately obsolete, women decide to overthrow society and run things themselves. The horror!

    Live-Action TV 

-   One sketch in _The Armstrong and Miller Show_ features a place called "Pleasure Planet", with hand-held devices that have this effect on the people who hold them.
-   Discussed in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_. The Scooby Gang capture a taser blaster from the Initiative and try to figure out how it works. Willow suggests just pushing buttons to see what happens, but Xander replies that since they're fiddling with a "blaster", randomly hitting buttons is not high on his agenda. He then adds that if it were called the "Orgasminator", that would in fact be his desired approach.
-   _Doom Patrol (2019)_: Flex Mentallo, whose superpowers let him cause a wide variety of different effects by flexing various muscles, accidentally causes orgasms for everyone on Danny Street (and the street themselves) by flexing the wrong one.
-   One episode of _The Drew Carey Show_ has Mimi receiving a pair of remote-controlled vibrating panties as part of her and Steve's efforts to conceive a child. Much to her horror, Drew gets his hands on the remote control and uses it on her.
-   A virtual reality "game" from the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "The Game" stimulates pleasure centers in the humanoid brain, making the device addictive to the point of even sounding orgasmic. Worse, it also renders the _Enterprise_ crew too euphoric to mind being boarded and overrun by the K'tarians that designed the game.
-   Episode 1 of the short-lived series _Valentine_ has the Goddess Aphrodite prove herself to a human woman by giving her a "straight shot of unconditional love".

    Music

-   Motörhead actually did a song titled "Orgasmatron".
-   The Simon & Garfunkel song "The Big Bright Green Pleasure machine" has the titular device all but said to do this for people who can't get sex in the ordinary way, as a satire of advertising/consumerism.

    Video Games 

-   In _Mass Effect 2_, a side conversation between a friend-zoned turian and an oblivious quarian introduces a quarian suit program that is apparently a masturbatory aid. The Shadow Broker's dossier for your quarian teammate Tali says she installed and uninstalled it in her own suit half a dozen times, before buying the deluxe version.

    Webcomics 

-   One _Cyanide and Happiness_ strip introduces a superhero whose power is "Having sex with women just by looking at them". Another man is astounded that he can bring women to orgasm at a glance, and he clarifies that _he's_ the only one who actually experiences it; otherwise, everyone would know his secret. The other man tells him that ejaculating every time he sees a woman doesn't qualify as a superpower.

    Western Animation 

-   _Æon Flux_: Peculiar Anti-Villain Trevor Goodchild catches Anti-Hero &A Elig;on by surprise and connects an air hose to her pressure suit. Held in place by her now-rigid suit, she identifies the gas filling it: "Bliss gas!" Aeon starts moaning with delight. Strangely, Trevor's pressure suit is hooked up to the same tubing, so that he also gets dosed with bliss gas. Aeon and Trevor somehow push this gas back and forth to each other in a bizarre allegory for sex. Of course, in Peter Chung's world, weirdness is de rigeur. In a different episode, Trevor regularly gives (a specific) woman an orgasm by surgically stimulating her spinal cord. It's a kinky show.
-   _Archer_: In "The Big Con", mad scientist Krieger develops a ray that causes the target to orgasm or days.
-   _Big Mouth_: "Nick Starr" is set in a dystopian future, where the adult Nick is a lonely man who can only achieve orgasm using a product called "Oh Yeah!", which he breaks open and sniffs to arouse himself.
