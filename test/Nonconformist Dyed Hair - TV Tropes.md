_"Interest in your bold rejection of social norms as evidenced by your dyed hair."_

In fiction, it's rather common for characters who are rather unconventional to also have hair dyed an unnatural and usually bright color, such as pink, blue, green, or purple. This is applicable to a wide variety of character types: punk rockers, free-spirited artists, people who are not really right in the head, goths, people from conservative backgrounds dipping their toes into rebellion, and many more. It also allows for a wide variety of hairstyles, such as hair dyed a single bright color, the tips of the hair being dyed, a few bright streaks, colorful mohawks, or hair that sports multiple colors.

The rationale for doing so is quite simple: these characters reject societal conventions and stand out in a crowd, so they reject 'conventional' hair colors as a visual signifier. They contrast people who stick to their natural hair colors or, if they do dye their hair, keep it to other natural colors or subtler, more elegant color modifications like highlights. For example, a traditionalist or conservative parent might dislike the fact that their child dyes their hair orange. School dress codes also tend to prohibit "unnatural" hair colors.

This trope is slightly weightier for natural brunets because it takes more work to put and maintain color on dark hair compared to blonde hair. In addition, characters from predominantly dark-haired populations stick out even more than they would in communities where some people are already varying shades of brown, blonde and red. For example, the Gyaru Girl dyes or bleaches her hair (and darkens her skin, in the case of the _ganguro_ and _yamanba_ types) to contrast the Raven Hair, Ivory Skin beauty standard in Japan. Nonconformist Dyed Hair is something of an Evolving Trope as well, since dyeing your hair an unnatural color has been much more common and accessible since the 2010s.

Colorful hair dye is a prime vector for an Expository Hairstyle Change. Someone experimenting with rebellion might dye their hair to signify this newfound freedom. Conversely, someone cleaning up their act might grow out their hair out and cut off the dyed parts, or dye their hair back to a 'regular' color. A Former Teen Rebel might be seen with dyed hair as a Funny Flashback Haircut, for example.

Sister Trope to Quirky Curls, another hairstyling choice that indicates someone is quirky. There may be some overlap with Delinquent Hair, which covers any hairstyling choices that mark someone as a troublemaker. Compare and contrast My Hair Came Out Green, which is when the character didn't mean for their hair to come out an unnatural color after a dye job, Mistaken for Dyed, where someone born with unnatural hair might cause a kerfluffle because of its nonconformist connotations, as well as later iterations of Elderly Blue-Haired Lady, for the grandmas who _choose_ to dye their hair odd colors. See also Kaleidoscope Hair, which might happen if they change colors frequently.

    Literature 

-   _Can You See Me?_: In _All the Pieces of Me_, New Transfer Student Annie has rainbow coloured hair that Tally compares to a unicorn. Tally finds her a little scary, because she's never met someone who looks different on purpose, like she doesn't mind being stared at. Annie later stands up to Tally's thieving, bullying "friends" instead of changing herself to fit in with them, like Tally does. Tally eventually realizes that it's better to be alone than to cut off pieces of yourself to fit in, and that Annie would make a much better friend than any of the girls in Tally's group.
-   _The Dresden Files_: As a teenager, along with having numerous tattoos and piercings, Molly Carpenter would dye her hair various colors, as an act of rebellion against her parents, especially Charity.

-   _Hannah Swensen_: Subverted in _Lemon Meringue Pie Murder_. When Michelle Swensen first appears in person, she comes off a bus with green streaks in her hair and some other nonconformist changes to her appearance (especially the clothes), to the point where Hannah didn't even _recognize_ her until Mike pointed her out, and thinks this trope is in effect. She visibly relaxes when Michelle explains that she was in a student play earlier that day, and just hadn't had time to change out of her costume or wash the spray dye out of her hair before she needed to catch her bus.
-   Inverted in _The Hunger Games_, where having quirkily dyed hair is a huge fashion trend in the materialistic and out-of-touch Capitol. For example, Effie has pink and purple hair, and Katniss's styling team wears their hair in a myriad of colors. Katniss, a rebel from the poorest district, is admired for her "natural beauty" (which includes her undyed brown hair).
-   Haley Dunlap from the _Juniper Sawfeather_ trilogy has always wanted to be one of the popular kids, but in _Echo of the Cliffs_, she stops trying to fit in and instead becomes the leader of the school rebellion against Mrs. Slater and the Student Council. She cuts her hair short and gets magenta highlights.
-   _Leia, Princess of Alderaan_ describes the teenage years of the aforementioned Amilyn Holdo. As a teenager, she dyes her hair wild colors and wears vibrant clothes, to distance herself from other Gatalentans, who are usually serious and prefer pale greys and whites. She's toned down her style as an adult, though she still has unconventional clothing and purple hair during her service with the Resistance.
-   _Maya's Notebook_: After nearly two days' worth of travel from California, Maya finally arrives to the remote Chiloé Island and is instantly recognized by her host.

-   Bertie in _Théâtre Illuminata Trilogy_ is constantly dying her hair different colors, showcased on each of the book's covers - in the first, it is Cobalt Flame blue, in the second, black and red, and the third, white. While the colors themselves are as dramatic as the theater she grew up in, the constant changes contrast the unchanging nature of the theater.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: Wylla Manderly is a bold Plucky Girl who openly declares her loyalty to the Starks while everyone else seemingly kowtows to the Lannisters and their allies. Her dyed green hair emphasizes her free-spirited nature and contrasts her with her sister Wynafryd, a quiet and composed Proper Lady with natural brown hair.

-   _Cobra Kai_ as part of his new more confident Hawk persona, Eli's Mohawk haircut goes through several different colours (Red, Blue and Purple) as the series progresses.
-   _Gilmore Girls_: Lane _attempts_ to do this in "One's Got Class and the Other One Dyes" by turning her black hair "Manic Panic Purple" to match her punk rock persona. But once it's done, she chickens out at the thought of her mother seeing it, and dyes it back to her normal color. However, she takes some joy in the fact that her hair is still _technically_ dyed, and keeps the one picture Rory took of her purple hair as a token of her brief rebellion.
-   _Ginny and Georgia_: Ginny experiments with a more unconventional hairstyle in Season 2, which includes dying blue streaks into her hair.
-   _Glee_: The very classically feminine and blonde popular girl Quinn goes through a short-lived rebellious phase in season three, which involves dyeing her hair pink, getting piercings, and dressing in dark colors. Zig-Zagged, since it was later revealed/retconned that Quinn's natural hair color is auburn, so her blonde hair was an example of _conformist_ dyed hair.
-   This is a plot-point in _Halo (2022)_. When Kai-125 follows John-117's lead in pulling out the Emotion Suppression pellet, she puts some streaks of pinkish-red in her hair using grease from her sniper rifle—one of the first signs of individuality from any SPARTAN. Miranda warns her that even this minor act of rebellion is a 'glitch' that her mother (Dr. Halsey, who created the SPARTANs) will not tolerate.
-   _House of Anubis_: Downplayed with Patricia in season 1. While her hair isn't technically dyed so much as she uses brightly-colored clip-on hair-streaks, it's another way of marking her as the tough, alternative "goth pixie" who stands in contrast to the rest of The House, such as being Nina's Foil and Sibuna's independent, anti-heroic Lancer.
-   _I May Destroy You_: Arabella has pink hair in the present and purple hair in the past. She's a free-spirited feminist writer.
-   _Jessie_: In "Karate Kid-tastrophe", Emma goes through a temporary rebel phase. She dyes her hair purple for this episode and starts dressing like a goth.
-   _Lizzo's Watch Out for the Big Grrrls_: Aspiring Grrrl Moesha shows up in blue and yellow hair, to go with her multiple tattoos and facial piercings.

-   _The Rising_: Neve is a tough, rather butch bisexual girl who's a Badass Biker with the tips of her boyish short hair dyed pale blue.

-   _Sex Education_: Maeve has naturally dark hair, and in the first season it's dyed blonde with pink streaks. She's the school's surly, rebellious outcast from a Trashy Trailer Home, and an outspoken feminist with a (slanderous) reputation for being promiscuous.

    Music 

-   Bowling for Soup: Implied in "Star Song", which carries a "Be Yourself" aesop:
    
    _Your mother's so happy you became a cheerleader  
    Homecoming queen, just like your older sister  
    'Til you dyed your hair pink, and she said what were you drinking?  
    And it never did sink in it don't matter what they think..._
    
-   Eminem, who bleached his naturally dark brown hair blond in 1998 to play his Ax-Crazy alter-ego Slim Shady, frequently uses this trope in his lyrics. His dyed hair launched a famous '90s Hair fashion trend, which worked beautifully with Slim Shady's role as The Virus, corrupting America's children with The Power of Apathy. Slim also came to signify Eminem's fame, relevance, dark side and drug addiction, so especially in his mid-period work, bleached-blond hair is used as a symbol of him relapsing back into his old misbehaviour (in Kayfabe).
    -   In the music video for "The Real Slim Shady", Eminem is flanked by factory-made dyed-haired youths representing rebellion in the hearts of kids — the Slim Shady lurking in every single person.
    -   In the music video for "Stan", Stan (a Loony Fan taking Eminem's persona literally) bleaches his hair to emulate his idol. He's also, as it turns out, murderously insane.
    -   "Sing For The Moment": The first verse describes a nonconformist child from a broken home with "dyed hair" whose parents fret that he is brainwashed from rock and rap music.
    -   Em returned to dark hair in 2008 to signal getting clean of his drug addiction. This was seen as such a potent signal that fans worried he was relapsing when he bleached it back in 2013 (which ended up being for his most mature album up to that point, maintaining only the playfulness of his blond older persona).
    -   Eminem also has an example of _conformist_ dyed hair when sarcastically debating becoming a mainstream manufactured Teen Pop star in "I'm Back":
        
        Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?

-   _Fate/Grand Order_: In her First Ascension, Sei Shounagon has bright blue and red stripes in her otherwise black-colored hair, and said black-colored hair turns pink upon her Second Ascension. This reflects how the carefree and energetic writer's appearance is based on modern youth (such as wearing modern clothing and playing with a phone in her animations). It also serves as a contrast to fellow Heian-era author and rival, Murasaki Shikibu, who has dark-colored hair and is old-fashioned.
-   In _Life Is Strange_, Chloe Price's most notable feature is her bright blue hair. She's a rebellious and angry punk who was expelled from the same school the protagonist, Max Caulfield, attends. She has her natural blonde hair in flashbacks (and an alternative timeline where her father lived), and while she still has a rebellious streak, she's a lot less overtly angry and contrarian. In the sequel in the timeline where she lives, her hair is now much longer, and only dyed on the ends, and she's much chiller (and has a better relationship with her step father).
-   _Mass Effect_: Asari "maidens" (young adults) are known for going a little wild for their first couple centuries of life, which often includes dyeing their skin or their scalp to colors other than its natural pale blue. Ereba, an asari you meet in _Mass Effect 2_, discusses this in the context of her relationship with her krogan boyfriend Charr who's trying to get her to marry him.
    
    **Ereba:** It's fun to join a mercenary guild or dance at bars for a few centuries, but eventually you hit the matron stage, you know? Then you get your back tattoo removed, let your scalp go back to its natural blue, and settle down with someone dependable.

-   _Persona_:
    -   _Persona 2_: Eikichi dyes his hair dark blue with a lighter blue patch at the front to match his Visual Kei aesthetic and his dreams of becoming a rock star. The dye is temporary because he thinks his conservative father would disapprove.

    -   _Persona 4_: Kanji dyes his hair blond in order to play up his delinquent reputation, which allows him to hide his actual secret, that being his interest in sewing and crafting. The Golden Ending introduced in _Golden_ shows him with his natural hair color, indicating that he's come to terms with himself.
    -   _Persona 5_:
        -   Ryuji dyes his hair blonde _because_ everyone thinks he's a deliquent, as a minor form of rebellion against the teacher that ended his dreams of a sports career and his former friends that abandoned him. However, that's as far as it goes, and he's actually a perfectly nice and decent guy.
        -   Futaba, the quirky hacker and hardcore gamer Otaku dyes her hair orange, even though she never leaves the house.
-   Abigail from _Stardew Valley_ is interested in the occult and enjoys adventuring in the mines and playing video games, to her parents' dismay. She dyes her hair, something her mother, Caroline, specifically dislikes. There are plenty of denizens in the setting with hair colors that would be considered unusual in real life (including Caroline herself), but Abigail's the only character who's explicitly stated to have dyed hair.
-   The delinquents in _Yandere Simulator_ dyed their hair blond. If the player wants to join the gang, she has to purchase blond hair dye.

    Visual Novels 

-   _CLANNAD_: Sunohara's blond hair is actually dyed, and his real hair color is a greyish blue that's similar to his sister Mei's hair. While he doesn't do much that's nonconformist aside from skipping class and being a Cloudcuckoolander, the fact that he bleaches his hair at all still marks him as a delinquent by Japanese standards. He dyes his hair back to his original one when he's about to get a job and it stays that way.
-   _Havenfall Is for Lovers_: Overlapping with Delinquent Hair, town troublemaker JD has a punk aesthetic and hair dyed in flame colors.

-   _DuckTales_: Lena has streaks of dyed pink hair, marking her as an edgy teen in contrast to clean-cut Webby. Subverted by the reveal that Lena is Magica's shadow, and was thus born with her hair already like that.
-   _The Legend of Korra_: Suyin and her family are the wealthy, powerful, and respectable leaders of Zaofu, and all have naturally dark hair due to being Fantasy Counterpart Asian. Of her children, Huan is the most artistic and expressive; he goes from long hair with an undercut in season three to long hair with green streaks in season 4.
-   _The Loud House_: Sam has a strip of aquamarine dyed into her hair, which goes with her aesthetic as a punk rocker.
-   Zigzagged in _The Owl House_. Amity Blight, a natural brunette, dyes her hair green on her mother's orders so she'll match with her older siblings' naturally green hair (which isn't considered an unusual hair color on the Boiling Isles), to symbolize how controlling her mother is. As her feelings for Luz develop and she decides to think more about what she wants for herself instead of what others expect of her, she dyes her hair purple to show how she's no longer going to just be what her mother wants.
-   In _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, Mayor Mare is an inversion: her hair is naturally vivid pink, but she dyes it gray, making her look older and more befitting an authority figure, but also making her stand out among the pony populace for not having brightly colored hair.
-   _Ready Jet Go!_: Implied to be the reason for the blonde streaks in Auntie Eggplant's hair. None of the other Bortronians have that in their hair, and Eggplant has been shown to surprisingly cunning. This means it could very well be a rebellious fashion statement.
