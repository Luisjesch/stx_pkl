_"Then let me keep it simple: once a month on the full moon, you return the book to me, followed by a night of_ paaaaaassionate fornication. _Aaaaand you get to keep it for the rest of the time, hm? Sound fair, my little imp?"_

The act of trading sexual favors for non-sexual favors: having sex with someone you wouldn't want to have sex with "for free" — or even if it's someone you _would_ do "for free", you let them believe otherwise — in exchange for gifts, doing work for you, or the like. The whole thing may or may not be portrayed and/or perceived as _really_ being a form of prostitution.

This trade may be portrayed in a neutral manner, or it may portray either the sex-trader or the service-trader as more or less a victim of the other. In either case, the act is often closely related to at least one other trope.

Neutral versions (As in, they are either equally good or equally bad)

-   For Happiness: They both get something they want, and everyone is happy. Life is good.
-   Sex Is Evil: They both get something they want, and they are both immoral creeps.
-   Sex Is Evil, and I Am Horny: They both get something they want, _and_ they are both pitiful creeps.
-   Casual Kink: _Any_ of the "unlucky sex-trader" or "unlucky service-trader" variants below, but as a Safe, Sane, and Consensual sexual role-playing game.
-   Pizza Boy Special Delivery: The exchange is little more than an excuse for sex.

"Unlucky sex-trader" versions:

-   Entitled to Have You: The service-trader just keeps nagging the sex-trader about sex that she/he doesn't want, until she/he finally gives in with an "okay, but at least do something for me as well". Alternatively, he/she does something for her/him first and doesn't reveal until afterward that the help actually came with a price tag.
-   Sexual Extortion: Sure, the sex-trader is the one taking the initiative, but what choice does he really have if the service is the only source of the medication his dying child needs, or the like? (In regular Sexual Extortion, the service-trader pushes An Offer You Can't Refuse on the sex-trader).
-   Scarpia Ultimatum: In a more odious version of the above, the service-trader demands sex in exchange for the life of the sex-trader's loved one. There's no real choice here.
-   Manipulative Bastard: The service-trader weasels his way into the sex-trader's bed with promises he never intends to keep and might not even be able to keep.
-   Drugs Are Bad: The sex-trader is addicted and will do anything to get his fix.

"Unlucky services-trader" versions:

-   A Man Is Always Eager: Alice exploits Bob's sex drive to get whatever she wants.
-   Gold Digger: The sex trader wants money... and lots of money... and even more money. They may also pretend to fall in love with their mark and perhaps will even invoke the Murder Tropes to get the "inheritance" faster.
-   Manipulative Bitch: The sex-trader makes the eager service-trader think he'll be getting sex in return for doing her a favor, but she has no intention of actually giving him any.
-   Lysistrata Gambit: Something of an inversion, where one party withholds sex from another in exchange for resources or a personal change.
-   The Schlub Pub Seduction Deduction: When the only reason a beautiful woman would come on to an unattractive man is if she has ulterior motives.

"Portrayed either way" versions:

-   Sleeping Their Way to the Top: The sex-trader offers sex in return for a promotion, a better job, or a higher social status which the services-trader can provide. May run the whole spectrum from plucky underdog overcoming adversity by acting out of the box, to a cynical and shrewd manipulator using underhanded tactics to get the prize over more skilled or deserving competitors.
-   Casting Couch: An actor (model, singer, etc.) sleeps with a producer to get the role. This is a Sub-Trope of Sleeping Their Way to the Top in which the "service" is specifically a part in a cast.
-   Sextra Credit: The "service" is better grades for a student and the services-trader is a teacher or professor.
-   Compensated Dating: A light form of prostitution that may or may not include sex; the focus is more on a "dating" relationship in which one partner (who otherwise might not be interested) is compensated with lavish gifts. It's often a sub-trope of the Gold Digger.
-   I Have Boobs, You Must Obey!: When a woman (hence the trope name) uses her sex appeal to convince another to do something she wants.

While one can certainly consider this a form of whoring, the sex-trader rarely intends to make an official career out of The Oldest Profession from making deals like this. The various uses of this trope are all Truth in Television, though not universal and some occur more than others. Compare Pragmatic Pansexuality. Contrast Platonic Prostitution, where one partner _is_ a prostitute but they _don't_ have sex. If a person is accused of doing this, it's a Success Through Sex Accusation. If a person perceives having sex as something they do solely for services and has hangups having sex with someone they're emotionally intimate with, this can be a variant of Romance and Sexuality Separation.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Blade of the Immortal_:
    -   When Rin and Manji meet for the first time, Rin attempts to convince Manji to become her bodyguard and help her get her revenge on the Itto-ryu, but Manji blows her off. After explaining how he can't just work for _anyone_ who wants him to kill for them (his curse requires him to kill a thousand evil men to be freed from his immortality but whose judgement can he trust about who is "evil"?) he challenges her to prove to him that she's really ready to give up _everything_ for her revenge. Misunderstanding him, she resignedly tells him he can do whatever he wants to her, but she's only just starting to undress when Manji smacks her across the face in appalled anger, since Rin looks like his late little sister.
    -   Played with shortly afterwards, after Manji kills Kuroi Sabato, the man who actually cut down Rin's father — he agrees to bodyguard Rin for four years until she's grown up and filled out properly, then he'll sell her to a brothel for far more than he can get for her now. Rin is not amused. This arrangement is pretty much never mentioned again.
-   _Berserk_: During the Golden Age arc, Governor Gennon of Chuder has young boys as hand servants that he molests and rapes constantly. To provide funding for the Hawks, Griffith slept with him, an act that fucked Griffith up badly and left Gennon with an obsession with him that would ultimately lead to his death at Griffith's hands in the Battle of Doldrey.
-   _Gate_: It is common in the Empire for people to use sex as a bribe or reward. Tuka considers selling her body to pay for her stay in Alnus and Princess Piña orders Bozes to sleep with Itami to get him to forgive her knights for beating him up (which doesn't work, since after psyching herself up for it, on entering Itami's room Bozes finds him having a tea party with the demihuman maids and slaps him). They are very surprised when the JSDF turns these offers down.
-   _Higehiro_: After Running Away From Home, Sayu survived for months by doing this. Yoshida is the first man to turn her down, letting her stay at his apartment without demanding sex (especially since she's _only 17_).
-   Lucoa tries offering herself to Shouta in exchange for room and board in _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_, though he understandably doesn't take her up on her offer (he's under the impression that she's actually a succubus). In her defense, this was after she had already offered him endless riches, supernatural charisma, and boundless magical powers; all of which he turned down for various reasons.

    Comic Books

-   In _Morbus Gravis_, the protagonist Druuna has to endure the Sexual Extortion variant: Her boyfriend is very ill and in her desperation for medication, she begs a disgusting old doctor to have sex with her.
-   _Whatever Love Means_ portrays traditional gender roles (man works, woman is housewife) this way (some would say rather unfairly).

-   _Sin City_: Leibowitz has to force a false confession out of framed cop John Hartigan, but after beating him for several days he starts complaining that his back is getting sore, so instead brings in a prostitute and offers her to Hartigan to see if the carrot works better. She's not that happy with the whole thing since Hartigan is accused of being a pedophile serial killer.
-   _Fine Print_: The Cubi do this, offering humans the best sex ever for their sexual energy, which is used to grow food they need.
-   _Red Ears_: In one of Dany's original comics, a rather buxom woman in a fur coat orders a taxi for a very long (ergo, expensive) drive. When they arrive at their destination, she says she doesn't have any money, but isn't wearing anything underneath her coat and offers to pay him another way. The driver rejects the offer because he doesn't have any change.

Martha believes that Karen is better off without her while Karen can't imagine life without her best friend Martha. After three weeks of arguing, Karen is at her wit's ends. After a heated argument with Martha, Karen decides to use sex as a way to get Martha to agree with her.

-   In _Promises Kept_ and its two sequels, Zuko allows Azula out of the asylum so that she can get information about their mother from their father. Her tactic of getting Ozai to talk is seduction.

Zuko gets his information but at the cost of Ozai brutally raping Azula, causing her to begin hallucinating again after a period of lucidity.
-   The AU _Firefly_ fic "Treasure" has one that's out of desperation. The economy collapsed, jobs are scarce and Zoe and Wash just became parents.

Fortunately, she doesn't have to do it. They run into pirates and after River's Waif-Fu takes care of things, they find a large stash on the pirate ship and Zoe can call it off.

It's just that of my unborn child._" She's put up for medical inspection of course. She uses sex to convince the doctor to back up her story. This is her stock and trade, really. Roxie wound up in jail in the first place because she killed her lover after he (cruelly) revealed he lied about being able to get her into show business just to get her into bed. She also tries to convince Billy Flynn to take on her case with this offer, but he brushes her off, as he's Only in It for the Money.

-   _Casablanca_: Chief Renault demands bribes, in the form of either money or sex, to issue travel permits to refugees on the way to the US. What keeps this from being Sexual Extortion and a gleeful trip across the Moral Event Horizon is that he never actually _demands_ sex; if the refugees decide he is asking too much and prefer to try their luck in Casablanca or manage to raise the money, he'll accept that without question.
-   Timmy Lea in _Confessions of a Window Cleaner_ is often paid in this manner, although it's implied on a few occasions that they hired Timmy primarily for sex rather than his window cleaning services.

    -   Discussed in _Grave Peril_: A homeless girl named Lydia comes to Harry for help, and he tells her that he wants something in return. She misconstrues it as a request for this trope and he quickly stops her because A) he just wanted more information, not sex, and B) she doesn't even look legal anyway. He comments in his internal monologue that it's probably not the first time she's traded sex for favors.

        -   In the short story "Bombshells" Harry Dresden's Fairy Godmother, Lea, notes that in the Norse myths of Freya reclaiming some stolen treasure from the Svartalves, the concept she simply kissed each of them is a Bowdlerization. They wouldn't let go of something that valuable for so little. She slept with the Svartalves. All of them who wanted it.
        -   In the same short story, a man was caught spying on Svartalf territory. He is able to negotiate his freedom if he spends the whole night with any Svartalf who would have him.

Falco rejects the offer, partially because he was badly burned last time he got involved with a female aristocrat.

-   Hitchhiker ghosts in _Ghost Roads_ can only receive favors freely given, and sex is the only way Rose Marshall has to repay people for rides or meals. She doesn't particularly mind because there can be no consequences (ghosts can't get pregnant or diseases) and it's an experience she wished she'd had in life. She's also not above using "a trip to the woods" to delay someone long enough to miss their appointment with death.
-   In _The Curse of M_, Katje, who was a High-Class Call Girl before she was captured and sent to the Institute, has sex with Doctor von Rached in exchange for small amenities, and because she figures (correctly) that he won't perform any truly nasty experiments on her so long as she's entertaining.

He meets a woman who offers to host him if and only if he has sex with her. He says he doesn't want to. She says she won't host him otherwise. He reluctantly agrees. There's a lot of focus on Lancelot's discomfort and the Questionable Consent nature of this. At the last moment the woman lets him out of the deal because he's so visibly uncomfortable.
    
    **Hostess:** Sire, my house is prepared for you, if you will accept my hospitality, but you shall find shelter there only on condition that you will lie with me; upon these terms I propose and make the offer.
    
    **Lancelot:** Damsel, I thank you for the offer of your house, and esteem it highly, but, if you please, I should be very sorry to lie with you.

    **Jet:** Sounds to me like blackmail.
    
    **Woodcock:** Damn right it is, but Jet, you are black and you are _male_.

He tries to bluff her by subtly enticing her with the _possibility_ of sex since he notes that she loves the chase, enough to make her want to take him on again in order to pursue him.

    -   Atia is introduced having sex with Timeon, who is disappointed in discovering she's actually more interested in the White Stallion he's just acquired. Unlike the usual version of this trope, Atia has the power in this situation, as she's a Roman noblewoman and Timeon is a Jewish horsetrader who secretly works for Atia as a hired thug. So it's an Establishing Character Moment — rather than just bribe Timeon to give her the horse Atia has sex with him, then puts him down with a Backhanded Compliment when he complains of her hidden agenda.

The story ends with the two women planning to get a new bed as well, with the implication being that they'll furnish their house this way.
-   On _My Name Is Earl_, this is apparently how Patty the Daytime Hooker gets her lunch, at least on Tuesdays. (It's her "Tuesday Afternoon Special.") She traded sex for a burger, fondling for curly fries, and a peek at her genitals for a pickle. Her lawyer asked to be recused from the case.
-   Mentioned repeatedly in _The Golden Girls_.

    Pro Wrestling

It all started when Bad News Brown confronted WWF president Jack Tunney on the set of the Brother Love Show and, after being dissatisfied with answers he was getting into why he wasn't getting a shot at Savage and the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, kicked the trope into effect by implying that Miss Elizabeth was seducing him and suggesting the two exchanged "favors" so that he would protect Savage from sure brutal defeat at Brown's hands. Tunney angrily denied the accusation (which led to Brown nearly assaulting Tunney) ... and needless to say, Savage wasn't very happy at all. In the end, Brown was a beaten man.

    Video Games 

-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, you can get Isabela to teach you the Duelist specialization with this trope, though the sex happens offscreen. If your character is female, you can also suggest this to Dwyn as payment for fighting to defend Redcliff, but he will decline.
    -   In _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, one of the options to conclude Josephine's questline involves offering "an unforgettable night" to a noblewoman as payment for the ennobling of a family.
-   Inverted in _Fallout 2_: if the Bishop family godfather in New Reno finds out you've been messing with his wife or daughter, he'll "hire" you to do various jobs for him for free.
-   _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines_:
    -   One of the earlier levels involves you trying to get a powerful explosive from a bunch of mobs. If your character is female and has a high enough seduction level, you have the option to offer this to their leader as payment. Since you are a vampire, however, no sex needs to ensue: your character instead just bites the mob boss in the neck and sucks some of his blood, leaving him with blurred memory and the vague impression something sexy happened.
    -   Venus, the owner of a Night Club in Downtown, has been resorting to this to pay her debt toward Russian mob Boris whenever she can't pay with money. One of the quests she gives you involves killing Boris so she won't have to do it anymore (though having high levels in Domination or Presence can get him to simply back off).
-   _World's End_ has a downplayed version of this. Ivan asks to borrow Oksana's red stone, the source of her magical powers, to see if he can make it work as well. To do so, she demands sexual favors from him. This isn't seen on screen, and the language is vague enough to either imply actual sex or something more like a striptease. Ivan does it, and Oksana does live up to her end of the bargain. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In the backstory provided for Cunningham in the _Silent Hill: Downpour_ tie-in comic, she agreed to sleep with her boss to get Murphy transferred to the prison she worked at, hoping to get revenge on him for supposedly severely injuring her father.
-   _Grand Theft Auto IV_: Mohammed, one of Roman's cab drivers, brags about how he allows his female passengers to pay for their fare with their bodies.
-   _Shantae: Risky's Revenge_: Apparently, doing a "sultry dance" is how Barracuda Joe got into Ammo Baron's army. Or something:
    
    **Barracuda Joe:** Name's Barracuda Joe, and this here's the BATTLE TOWER.  
    You got a PASSPORT?  
    \[No\]  
    Sorry kid. Citizens only.  
    Go see the AMMO BARON.  
    Enlist and he'll get you straightened out.  
    That or do a saucy dance.  
    That's how Barracuda Joe got in.
    

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Double Homework_, this is the motivation behind Lauren's sexual openness with the protagonist. She will go all the way with him in return for the social currency of having a famous boyfriend.

    Web Animation 

-   Gamer Poop parodies it in one of the _Skyrim_ videos, where a woman, unable to afford the fee to prepare her upcoming wedding, negotiates an alternate form of payment by sleeping with the wedding planner. It would have potential for drama were it not for both of their hilariously enthusiastic and casual attitudes and the fact the scene lasts less than thirty seconds.
-   _Helluva Boss_: After stealing Stolas' grimoire to gain access to the living world, Blitzo ends up developing a transactional relationship with the prince: once every full moon, Blitzo must return the book and spend a night of "passionate fornication" with Stolas if he is to continue using it for his business. It's also worth mentioning that the whole deal started because Blitzo's aggressive attempts to subdue the prince and steal his grimoire ended up arousing Stolas instead. As the series progresses this gets deconstructed, as Stolas and Blitzo are developed to be immensely love-starved individuals that could develop a truly loving relationship, but the context in which it was started as well as the power imbalance between their respective social status are major obstacles to the both of them realizing real romance is an option.

Unfortunately for her, the Heavy misinterprets it as the former and blows her off because her clothes would not fit his frame.
