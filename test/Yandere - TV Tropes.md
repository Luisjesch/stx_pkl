She loves you, and she'll do anything to have you. **ANYTHING.**

_"You'd actually be attractive if you didn't have crazy eyes."_

"Yandere" is derived from the Japanese words _yamu_, meaning to be sick (mentally or physically), and _deredere_, meaning affectionate or loving. Simply put, a _yandere_ is someone who is lovesick, someone who has been driven to insanity by extreme obsession or love, thus resulting in abnormal behavior if not violence. Take the Tropes Love Makes You Crazy, Love Makes You Evil, Love Hungry, and Stalker with a Crush, and condense everything into a singular personified character archetype.

The word "yandere", a term that blossomed in moe fandom, refers to a character who is crazy about someone else... often literally and violently. Yanderes are usually identifiable by their blank eyes when they go crazy, blood being soaked on them for the majority of their screentime, carrying at least one signature weapon that they use to kill and/or attack others for the majority of their screentime, a mostly Moe appearance or at least an appearance that will deceive others, psychotic behavior, and a tendency to attack and/or kill people who would get in the way of their love. Many of them are Ax-Crazy. "Benign" cases don't even need to bring weapons or violence into the mix: just a well-established aura of menace and the feeling of dread if you step out of line is enough. When on the Good Guys' team, they are often the Token Evil Teammate (or at least the fourth type of the Anti-Hero).

The character almost always appears perfectly cute and harmless on the surface... but underneath they may be obsessive, controlling, and sometimes just plain insane. This is bad news for anyone unfortunate enough to be the object of a Yandere's obsession, as nothing will dissuade the Yandere from the notion that they are theirs and theirs alone. But even _more_ pity should be saved for anyone who gets in the way, as this psycho-obsessive is amazingly unwilling to put up with any rivals to their often genuine affection. Most Yanderes have a history of mental instability, but some have always been just a little bit "off", perhaps the product of a Dark and Troubled Past and a good round or more of Break the Cutie. If a Yandere ever goes off the deep end, they are likely to go Ax-Crazy, taking up the psycho weapon of their choice and doing things to people straight out of a horror movie. Sometimes, they're also going to be revealed as a Psychopathic Manchild (or womanchild if the Yandere is female). Usually their target is whoever they perceive to be in the way, but if the person they love rejects them or leaves them, they may well decide that they would rather see the person dead than with another or themself because they're nothing without them, which may well lead to tragedy.

Interestingly, while Yanderes are usually villains by dint of their psycho and murderous nature, they can still be perceived as Moe if they manage to gain enough tragic audience sympathy. A sympathetic Yandere often has the person they love as a Living Emotional Crutch, and goes completely crazy and murderous at the thought of losing them, either romantically or otherwise. Worst case scenario, they'll go into a Never My Fault fueled Villainous Breakdown, at which point they lose the sympathy points.

Their insanity may also add to their sexual appeal in a perverse way, verging into the territory of Romanticized Abuse and Power Dynamics Kink.

Their Stock Phrase will be "If I Can't Have You… _no one_ will!"

Part of the _dere_ family along with Tsundere (cranky outside, sweet inside), or sub-groups; Kuudere (cold outside, sweet inside), and Dandere (asocial outside, sweet inside). However, those are all sweet inside, while the Yandere is sweet outside, crazy inside. While a Sweet Tsundere may have some similarities with a Yandere (especially if jealousy is one of their vices), the Yandere will often patiently endure things that will send any Tsundere utterly bonkers, but the Yandere's jealous, possessive and obsessive nature won't let them accept the possibility that the person they love can be happy without them. Unlike most Tsunderes, including sweet Tsunderes, a Yandere is usually a Girly Girl with a Tomboy Streak, or even a Girly Bruiser, since she is girly and lovey dovey outside, but violent inside.

Such characters are mostly female, but male examples exist. Compare with the Violently Protective Girlfriend, who can become Ax-Crazy when the love interest is in danger, but is otherwise _**much**_ more stable mentally. At the very least she's more likely to keep her uses of force proportionate to the situation: someone flirting with you will be more likely to cause her to react with a Death Glare instead of a chainsaw. If the admirer is crazy, but tends to be the one who gets violently abused by their affection, then this is Mad Love.

When two Yanderes form a relationship, they are a Yandere Couple.

See also Clingy Jealous Girl, Crazy Jealous Guy, Love Makes You Evil, Love Makes You Crazy, Stalker with a Crush, Stalker Shrine, Domestic Abuse, Violently Protective Girlfriend, Villainous Crush, Always Save the Girl, and If I Can't Have You…. Compare Stepford Smiler, Psycho Supporter, and I Have You Now, My Pretty. May God have mercy on you if you are caught in a Psychotic Love Triangle (a love triangle with two members being Yanderes). Contrast with Bitch in Sheep's Clothing, in which a character is consciously using the illusion of purity and niceness to cover up a sadistic true nature (though a BISC _can_ become a Yandere if we add obsession and mental instability to the mix). At the extreme, A Love to Dismember can occur. Due to their often violent nature, they are likely to be The Unfettered. The more savage examples are also very likely to be Faux Affably Evil. Don't confuse with _Yandere Kanojo_, a manga which surprisingly doesn't involve actual yandere (except for one case, in which the victim had it coming. It ends well, though). Also contrast Cute and Psycho a.k.a. Yangire, who is also sweet and crazy, but whose craziness _isn't_ tied to love, and Lacerating Love Language, if the character's violent tendencies are restricted to their object of affection and not perceived threats to their relationship. Pretty much _every single character_ that can be considered a Yandere is also a Memetic Molester, as that’s when a character is portrayed as a Yandere by fans, canon or not.

    Advertising 

-   These commercials from Virgin Mobile actually advertise from a Yandere's point of view. She's seen sitting in a tree outside his house on a stormy night and talking about how they just had the best first date ever and she can use her phone to check on whether he's mentioned her yet and if his exes are hotter than her and that she can "check his Four Square profile for patterns." "And it's only $25 a month! That's _crazy_ right!?" _(horror lightning)_ Then there's a sequel to this ad featuring the same girl in another guy's closet.

    Asian Animation 

-   Ouyang Xueli from _Cupid's Chocolates_ is a terrifying one that was main character Jiang Haoyi's Childhood Friend before she turned into a Jerkass Tsundere obsessed with beating Haoyi at anything that could be a competition after being convinced by her mother that it was the best way to gain Haoyi's heart, only for this to backfire when he only distanced himself from her. Her Establishing Character Moment is to blast the door to Haoyi's classroom, throw several blades that nearly hit him and then give him a deep-tongue Forced Kiss while telling Xia Zitong (who had just asked him out on a date) that he's taken, while Haoyi begs for help before she tries to rape him. Her obsession began when, after an attempt to do Operation: Jealousy on him became a humiliating failure (as the involved guy not only dumped her in public, but did so because he was marrying another girl), she decided Haoyi was the only good thing in her life and desperately do everything in her hand to prevent him from leaving her.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina_ the Mole King goes Ax-Crazy when Thumbelina rejects him and chooses Tom instead.

-   _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_: Frollo is a strange one. It's certainly not love, for obvious reasons. It's also not just the desire for sex, because then _any_ woman would suffice. It's more like an unhealthy obsession. Which, of course, fits the definition of Yandere to a tee. Now throw in a ridiculously rigid version of Catholic sexual morals, and you get one of the greatest Disney villains of all time.
-   Bowser from _The Super Mario Bros. Movie_ is madly in love with Peach. His primary goal in the movie is to marry her, but he plans to do so under the threat that he will destroy her kingdom if she doesn’t accept his proposal. Throughout the movie, he comes to despise Mario under the suspicion that the Italian plumber is trying to woo Peach and tries to have Mario killed out of jealousy. Bowser also does try to carry out his threat to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom after Peach rejects him.
-   In _Megamind_, Hal turns into one for Roxanne. He harbored strong possessive feelings for her before he gained his powers. Once he got them, he felt like he finally had a chance with her and showed off his powers to her. Unfortunately, she didn't return his feelings, despite his belief that he should have her since he's a superhero. This leads to him taking his anger out on the city and almost killing her by throwing a _bus_ at her.
-   Gabi the Poison Dart Frog from _Rio 2_ takes a look into the -dere side of this trope. On her own, she's a Genki Girl who is affable to anyone she comes across. However, the reason she's a villain is her love for Nigel the Cockatoo, which is explored in her Villain Song, "Poisonous Love". In short, she's driven to be psychotic due to her love of Nigel, proudly proclaiming that she'd murder any bird for his sake.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Pele — the Hawaiian Goddess of Lava is known for her fiery temper. She fell in love often and most of those young men were not fortunate to escape with their lives. The incredible details of some of the stories is what really makes her special.
-   Dido in _The Aeneid_. When Aeneas leaves Carthage, Dido curses him and all of the surviving Trojans, then commits suicide. It bears mentioning that said curse involves _damning their two future nations to constant savage bloodletting_.
-   There is a Japanese folktale concerning a woman named Kiyohime who, when rejected by the object of her affections, a monk who took a vow of celibacy, turns into a dragon and incinerates both him and herself when he tried to hide from her underneath a giant bell. More information can be found on The Other Wiki.
-   The huldra of Scandinavian folklore are a type of fairy who appear as beautiful women with cow or horse tails. Although they are often eager to marry, they are also very strict and demanding, and if you even think of turning one down, she will kill you. This being folklore, this is of course only one version, albeit a common one... though one of the variations is simply to change marriage to being lovers.
-   Ishtar (Inanna) of Mesopotamian Mythology. All of her lovers ended up dead, which is why Gilgamesh turns her down when she asks him to marry her. Cue Ishtar running to her daddy, pitching a fit, and threatening to cause a Zombie Apocalypse if he doesn't give her the Bull of Heaven instead (even though doing so will cause a drought.) She later has her husband Tammuz/Dumuzi Dragged Off to Hell for cheating on her while she was off trying to conquer the underworld.
-   The story of the 4 winds in Lakota mythology. They were all in love with the goddess Wohpe. She chose the South Wind, because he wasn't so vocal about it. The North Wind tries to steal her away from his younger brother every winter. The North Wind is represented by the color white, and the South Wind is represented by the color red.
-   Classical Mythology:
    -   Persephone turns a nymph into a mint plant, and then stamps on her, for daring to flirt with her husband Hades. The weird thing is that Persephone originally ended up as Hades' wife when Hades _captured her and forced her into marriage_, so either Persephone experienced some form of A Match Made in Stockholm that led her to become jealously protective of him, or, as some interpretations of the story state, Persephone always loved Hades and could not act upon her feelings due Demeter's possessiveness of her. Hades has kept faithful to Persephone and seems to treat his wife well.
    -   Demeter is a rare motherly-love yandere. It was always implied that she was screwed up in the head like most of the Greek gods, which can be seen as an inciting factor for Persephone sticking with Hades if her kidnapping was indeed staged, but in response to her daughter being kidnapped, Demeter curses the earth to have all of its crops wither away for three months per year, essentially creating winter. In essence, Demeter responds to her beloved daughter being abducted by unleashing her wrath onto everybody who had _no_ involvement in it.
    -   Suprisingly Artemis, at least according to Homer's Odyssey. When Calypso was complaining about the Double Standard of male gods being allowed to screw willy-nilly while the female goddesses aren't. She mentions how, Artemis shot Orion in jealousy after seeing him being carry off by Eos, goddess of dawn.
    -   Hera, wife of Zeus. Half or more of the myths about her and about the only thing she is remembered for is pursuing horrible vengeance on the lovers of Zeus and their offspring. (Zeus being by far the most powerful of the gods, there was nothing she could do to harm him directly.) The worst acts were probable against Lamia and Hercules. Hera either stole or in the worst stories forced Lamia to kill her own children turning her into a monster. The latter she tormented his entire life in one way or another, but the worst would be inflicting madness on him causing him to murder his own family. The 12 Labors that made him famous were ironically for a crime he arguably had no control over. She seemed tolerant of Ganymede, however. She apparently stops trying to torture Heracles after he dies, ascends to full godhood and marries her daughter, or at least there are no myths telling of it. But would having Hera as a mother-in-law really make things better? Probably not.
    -   Ironically, Hera was also the _victim_ of a Yandere in one story, along with Artemis. The story varies Depending on the Writer (Homer, Virgil, and Ovid have all told versions) but the giant brothers Otus and Ephialtes (collectively called the Aloadae) wanted to storm Mt. Olympus and gain Artemis for Otus and Hera for Ephialtes; strange part is, they seemed capable of _doing_ it. One version claims they built a mountain even bigger than Olympus to lay siege to it, most say Zeus' thunderbolts couldn't hurt them, and most also say they were able to capture Ares and stuff him in a jar for thirteen months. Eventually, Artemis either surrendered to Otus or tried to seduce him in order to free Ares (again, depends on the writer) which made his brother jealous because Hera hadn't even noticed him, and the two fought; Artemis changed herself into a doe and jumped between them (possibly her plan or Apollo's plan the whole time); the Aloadae, not wanting her to get away, threw their spears and simultaneously killed each other, not invulnerable to their own powerful blows.
    -   The god Zephyros, the West Wind had an obsessive crush on the demigod Spartan Prince Hyacinthus. Hyacinthus however chose Apollo instead. A jealous Zephyros murdered Hyacinthus via a discus to the head.
    -   Medea of Greek myth is a scary one: when Jason left her, she _burned her rival alive_ with a fire so intense _it set the royal palace on fire_, set the city of Corinth on fire for being ruled by the man who got Jason to dump her, and killed her own children to end his line (A Fate Worse Than Death for the ancient Greeks). It was so bad that Hera, who, as Jason's protector, the one who had set him with Medea, and was supposed to be the one to punish Jason for his oathbreaking, couldn't find anything to add onto of what Medea had already done, limiting herself to let him live as he lost all his glory and was reduced to a beggar (basically, letting what Medea had done stand). One of Jason's sons, Thassalus, did survive his mother's attempt on his life, and managed to reclaim the throne of Iolcus.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Gudrun and Brynhild in the Saga of the Volsungs.
-   Some interpretations of Paradise Lost posit that _Lucifer_ is basically the greatest yandere of all times, unable to suffer the knowledge that God would rather be loved by a fallible, mortal, corrupted humanity than by the Morning Star himself.
-   Asmodeus is the demon of Lust because he was the Stalker with a Crush on Sarah and killed all of her suitors before being defeated by Tobit.
-   According to Islamic interpretations, Lucifer (known as _Iblis_ or _Shaytān_) was evicted for his pride, but also jealousy - he loved God, but refused to accept Adam, believing him to be an inferior creature that is not worthy of God's love, thus swore revenge by tempting humanity away from God.

    Roleplay 

-   _Survival of the Fittest_:
    -   Zachariah Johnston from TV1. He started out as an dorky kid with autism who happened to have a crush on Mae St. Clair. However, he becomes jealous of Shawn Morrison (the other part of the Love Triangle), and has flat out attacked other characters who he thinks will hurt her or steal her away, most notably Harold Smythe.
    -   Robin Pounds from Program v2 becomes incensed when Shawn Bowe-Crooke abandons her, and tracks him down specifically to destroy him and everything he loves.
-   _NoPixel_: Four Tee is an aromantic variation by way of having been isolated for most of her life and not having an understanding of how love and romance function. She "loves" everyone on her friends list and is so seemingly whimsical to be disarming and endearing even to folks she's not friends with. However, she's also extraordinarily bonkers, is obsessed with her friends to stalkerish extremes, will not hesitate to go full-tilt psycho to anyone who harms or slights her friends, and has murdered friends for "leaving" her.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Exalted_
    -   Lilith is a rare sympathetic example. She _was_ normal and sane, but was mentally tortured by her absolute horrifying monster of a "husband" Desus so _badly_ that she shattered into a mental, slightly Ax-Crazy wreck who was a sad little puppet for Desus. By the period the game takes place in, she's recovered - somewhat, and this is after going feral and living in pure chaos for the better part of _2,000 years_ - although she tends to understandably explode into a frothing rage whenever she sees something related to Desus - which is unfortunate for Desus' reincarnation, Swan, who, while not a _hero_ exactly, is still a _lot_ better person than Desus ever was.
    -   Adorjan is a Yozi who's gone seriously yandere. One of the more powerful Charms she offers to her chosen does _ridiculous_ amounts of damage, but has the side effects of a) doing some of that damage to yourself, and b) getting Adorjan "interested" in you if you ever use it on her. As the Quotes page says, her hatred is safer.
    -   Also from the Yozi pile is Kimbery, who's a cross between this and every overbearing mother ever. She loves her "children" with all her heart and ladles them with all sorts of gifts... at least, until she thinks that they'll betray her, at which points she drowns them in poison and acid, both literally and metaphorically.
-   _Legend of the Five Rings_ allows you to give your character a yandere stalker via the Bad Fortune: Secret Love disadvantage, netting you a few extra Experience Points at the cost of having some unknown Non-Player Character out there in the world who will stop at nothing to have your character all to him- or herself.Like almost all Disadvantages in this particular RPG, it is basically a blank check for the GM to screw you over. Popular Secret Loves include your daimyo or the daimyo's spouse, Scorpion Clan members and insane(r) oni. In modern versions this include Spider Clan members, Tainted individuals or maho-tsukai.
    -   Kyoso no Oni, one of the four Oni Lords, is pretty much the patron saint of Yandere and scorned lovers in Rokugan.
-   The Deceivers from the Third Edition of _Nobilis_ love everything and think that the best way to express that love is to strip things of the toxic lies that enshroud them and hide their true nature. Lies most people call "existence."
-   _New World of Darkness_:
    -   The Galateids from _Promethean: The Created_ tend to have this as their Torment. Seeing as they embody the sanguine humor, their periods of Torment tend to involve giving into murderous obsession over others; the book lists the example of abducting an unrequited lover's girlfriend, holding her at knifepoint, and demanding the lover choose between the two.
    -   Princesses of Mirrors from _Princess: The Hopeful_ have the downside of getting insane whenever they abuse their magic. One of the possible insanities they can develop is to become a Yandere, the trope being even referred by name. Since their Charms include powers helping seduction and the ability to literally peel someone's beauty off their face, this is _not_ a good thing.
-   In _Warhammer 40,000_, the Chaos god Nurgle fell in love with Isha, the Eldar goddess of life. After Nurgle rescued Isha from Slaanesh, he expressed his love for her by imprisoning her in a cage and killing any warriors who attempted to rescue her. Now he uses her as a test subject for his plagues.

    Theatre 

-   _Carmen_: It starts with Don José going to jail for Carmen — and _keeping the flower she gave him_ the whole time. He comes back and joins her group, but he can't deal with how she flirts with other guys. He picks a knife fight with her new lover — _a bullfighter_ — over her, and when she's sent him away for good, he meets her outside of the arena and kills her.
-   Donna Elvira for _Don Giovanni_. She gets better.
-   Brünhilde for Siegfried, in _Goetterdaemmerung_.
-   Canio from _Pagliacci_ learns that his wife Nedda is cheating on him, and loses it. At first, the audience thinks he's giving a very emotional performance, but soon realize this is for real. Canio kills Nedda and Silvano and gives a Bond One-Liner.
-   Scarpia from Puccini's _Tosca_ could count, seeing how he doesn't hesitate to endanger Floria Tosca's lover Mario Cavaradossi in order to get her to sleep with him.
-   Count di Luna is this towards Leonora in Verdi's _Il trovatore_. Not only is he furious about Leonora being in love with Manrico, but he chases them down and tries to kill Manrico in order to have Leonora to himself, only to realize that Manrico was his own _brother_. But by then, both Manrico and Leonora are already dead.
-   Prince Golaud from Debussy's _Pelléas et Mélisande_ becomes this way after his wife Mélisande falls in love with his half-brother Pélleas and has an affair with him.
-   Leos Janácek's opera _Jenufa_ has Laca, who becomes angry with the titular character for loving his brother Steva and not him and even slashes her face in anger when she refuses to return his affections. This leads poor Jenufa to being abandoned by her fiancé, who dumped her in spite of being attacked by his own brother and _hooked up with the pretty daughter of the mayor_. Even more, Jenufa and Laca become a couple by the end.
-   There's also Barnaba from Ponchielli's _La Gioconda_, who lusts after the titular singer and tries to kill Gioconda's beloved mother and the lovers Laura and Enzo in order to get her, though he fails in killing the lovers thanks to Gioconda's help. However, Gioconda stabs herself before he can have his way with her.
-   Abigaille from Verdi's _Nabucco_ is this to a T. She loves Ismaele, but Ismaele is in love with Fenena. Furious, Abigaille threatens to accuse Fenena of treason, but Ismaele refuses to do so, thus leading to Abigaille's plan for revenge.

-   In _Avenue Q_ Christmas Eve is usually a Tsundere but in "The more you ruv someone" there are lines which depict her as a possessive type 3.
-   Abigail Williams from _The Crucible_ fits this trope like a glove. After her boss John Proctor ends their affair, Abigail jumps at the opportunity to have his wife Elizabeth arrested and executed for witchcraft. It backfires _big time_. Elizabeth's pregnancy keeps her from being executed; John takes the blame upon himself and chooses execution over admitting witchcraft and losing his land, which would leave his family homeless.
-   _Hamilton_ casts King George III of England this way. _You'll Be Back_ could be a yandere anthem:
    
    I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love.
    
-   _Heathers_ has J.D. to Veronica. They actually managed to ramp it up from the movie. Check out these lyrics from the song "Meant to Be Yours:"
    
    ''You chucked me out like I was trash,  
    for that you should be dead.  
    But, but, but!  
    Then it hit me like a flash;  
    What if high school went away instead?  
    Those assholes are the key,  
    they're keeping you away from me.  
    They made you blind,  
    messed up your mind,  
    but I can set you free!
    
-   Jackie-O from _The House of Yes_. She kills her twin brother, whom with she has been having an incestuous relationship for most of their lives, when he attempts to regain a life of normalcy with his utterly average fiancee.

-   Nessarose from _Wicked_ is this only for the musical. She developed feelings for Boq when he decided to talk to her during the dance. He certainly didn't help his situation by telling her that she was beautiful in an attempt to make it less obvious that he's there because he felt bad for her. That and he was doing it because Galinda asked him. Over the years, Nessa ruled over the Munchkins and had restricted their rights because of Boq. Once her sister granted her the ability to walk, he thinks that she no longer needs him and decides to try leaving her for Galinda. Her response is to use Elphaba's magic book to try making him hers. Unfortunately, she shrinks his heart and Elphaba is forced to give him a tin form so that he doesn't die.

-   The titular character of _Miss Julie_. She has a destructive crush on her driver, and uses her power to push him about, teasing him, playing with him, until circumstances get out of control.
-   Bluebeard, for Judith and all the other women he kills and keeps forever.
-   _Othello_, who smothers his wife to death because he thinks she's been unfaithful. There's also Iago, by way of Alternate Character Interpretation, who may have committed all his acts of villainy out of lust for Othello.
-   _The Phantom of the Opera_: Erik, the eponymous Phantom, towards Christine. Erik captures Christine's lover and gives her the choice of being with Erik forever or watching her lover die. Ultimately subverted as, when Christine _does_ choose Erik, he realizes that he can't force her to love him and lets her go.
    -   In the theatrical sequel _Love Never Dies_, Meg Giry has become one: she has fallen in love with the Phantom, now her employer at a pierside show in Coney Island, New York. When she sees how much he still loves Christine, Meg goes insane and kidnaps Christine's son, leading to a rather ... explosive finale.
-   Lucy from _13_ is a milder version of this trope. She looks like your Average Self-Concious Teengage Girl, but just _mention_ Brett and she becomes Clingy Manipulative and Bitchy. She may not be willing to murder, but she is willing to ruin a few social lives.
-   Depending on the interpretation, The Governess from _The Turn of the Screw_. This only works in the interpretation where The Governess is insane, the ghosts are not real, and she has the hots for Miles, killing him to protect him from corruption, or for her secretive employer, wanting to dramatically save the children to win his attention and respect.
-   Andrea, in one of the skits of _Voices from the High School_.
    
    _"Yeah, I know. the jerk's waiting. So go. I haven't got a gun. Yet."_
    
-   The title character of _Wozzeck_, for Marie.
-   Salome, the Princess of Judea at the time of Jesus, is this toward Jokanaan (John the Baptist) in both Oscar Wilde's play _Salome_ and Richard Strauss's opera adaptation. Whenever she's around Jokanaan she can't stop saying "I want to kiss your lips!" When he, predictably, wants nothing to do with her so long as she remains uninterested in Christianity, she uses a seductive dance to trick her stepfather, Herod, into giving her "anything she wants," which ends up being Jokanaan's severed head on a plate.
-   As in the film, Norma in _Sunset Boulevard_ is this towards Joe, effectively keeping him financially dependent on her, emotionally blackmailing and manipulating him, keeping tabs on what he's doing and who he's spending time with (when not with her) and when he finally decides to get out of the relationship she shoots and kills him, citing the parallel relationship between Salome and John the Baptist.
-   By golly, Death in _Elisabeth_. His ideas of things to do to win the titular Empress' love include sabotaging her marriage (or at least gloat in her face as it breaks down), and killing her oldest daughter and only son. There's a reason a fan overlaid You'll Be Back from _Hamilton_ over Death's solo at Elisabeth's wedding and it fits perfectly. _I will kill your friends and family... to remind you of my love._

-   One of the newer characters in _Happy Tree Friends_ is Mr. Pickels, who is a platonic yandere for another newer character called Lammy. He does _not_ like her showing affection to anyone other than him.
-   The entire point of _How to Deal with a Yandere_, a step-by-step comedy series in walfas that has to Joey how to deal with his yandere girlfriend, Lily.
-   Doki from _There she is!!_ starts as a fairly minor example of this: She does chase Nabi around the city and can't take "No" for an answer, but otherwise doesn't seem to be all that crazy or violent. Her love craziness reaches its apex midway to Step 3, until she becomes saner, but only after Nabi agrees to become her boyfriend. While it could be seen this way, keep in mind, "There She Is" is all about showing Nabi and Doki's relationship in a condensed form. It can also be interpreted that Doki's trying to chain away Nabi's social qualms with their relationship, as can be seen in the later steps.
-   _RWBY_: Adam Taurus can be seen as one, due to his obsession of Blake Belladonna, who left him.
-   _RWBY Chibi_:
    -   Nora's obsession with Ren results in her trying to cook Ren into a "love potion" or trying to heal a broken leg with The Power of Love with a bedside manner that is straight out of _Misery_.

-   _Gossip City_:
-   _hololive_: Many members have displayed yandere tendencies to varying degrees, but three members in particular have it as a defining personality trait.
    -   Korone Inugami from _hololive_ GAMERS is a pretty severe yandere if given the chance, especially in regards to Okayu Nekomata. When Subaru Oozora told her in _Minecraft_ that Okayu was both kissing her and being cute with Kureiji Ollie, Korone responded with a foreboding, "Eh?", before proceeding to beat Okayu up. Other members, including Mio Ookami, have noted that Korone gets absolutely _scary_ when she goes yandere, and even has empty irises<small>◊</small> for when she becomes a yandere. Even her viewers aren't safe, as when Korone gets messages from them explaining how much her videos mean to them, she'll accept the compliment, but not before making remarks of how they've probably said things like this to other women, and that if she relaxes them so much, they've probably fallen asleep on her.
    -   Rushia Uruha from _hololive_ Fantasy isn't as violent of a yandere as Korone, but she's _very_ equal-opportunity about being one. If her chat ever makes references to other members of _hololive_, she immediately catches on and accuses them of leaving her for other streamers, and whenever other members want to decide where to hang out with her, notably Shion Murasaki, she pressures them into hanging out at her house. She also denies herself being a yandere, as when her chat asked for a yandere ASMR from her, she made sure that they wanted it not because they like yanderes, but because they like _her_. Rushia even offered to have her viewers partake in a suicide pact the day she inevitably goes down.
    -   Ceres Fauna from _hololive_ -Council- is one to humanity as a whole, due to effectively abandoning her by evolving to become part of civilization, leaving their nature roots behind. Fauna insists that she isn't mad, and that she _loves_ humans, but expresses how humanity _belongs_ with her, stating her intentions of winning them back. Either patiently with her streams to change their heart, or forcibly restraining them and turning them into saplings.
-   _hololive ERROR_:
    -   Nanase Furukawa is this, though not entirely by choice. Part of the personality shifts caused by the spirits of Aogami Forest was amplifying her attraction towards the New Transfer Student into a full-blown obsession. It gets so bad that she begins seeing other girls, such as Shino Misora, as garbage solely due to being around the transfer more than she is, rubs in Shino's face how they will not be able to go out all together, outright considers killing off her friends solely because one of them told her to stop antagonizing others and she took it as them wanting to stand between her and the transfer, and eventually lashes out at Shino, telling her how she's worthless and that she should just disappear.
    -   In a weird twist, Shino Misora turns out to be yandere towards _herself_... sort of. The blue-eyed other Shino ("other" meaning "not the protagonist") is extremely insistent on the protagonist Shino "going back" with her, not clarifying anything and simply chasing after her when she believed to have been denied. Mind you, she was _not_ denied: the main character version of Shino simply wanted answers, and would've likely gone with the other Shino had she been told the reason why she needed to. She eventually relaxes about it, becoming rather cold and sardonic when her protagonist self continuously refuses to go along. On the other hand, the _brown_\-eyed other Shino is more of the possessive, Homura Akemi-esque type, wanting to keep her protagonist counterpart within the Perfect World - a Lotus-Eater Machine showing a happy idyllic school life where everyone wants nothing more than to be Shino's friend - at all costs and being more than willing to exploit her status as being In the Dreaming Stage of Grief after having realized she was Dead All Along so as to make it happen... all to ensure that Shino remains happy, and on _her_ terms.
-   _Manga Soprano_: Saya kidnapped his ex-girlfriend Asami when he stopped a fire that occurred at her wedding between her and Yuto. He tried to force her to take him back but she resisted and she was rescued by Ram, by calling her yakuza family and Haru who is a hacker.
-   This is the premise for a lot of episodes of _Reina's room_. Many female characters fall madly in love with the main protagonists especially after they did something nice for them.
-   _Uta's RomCom Manga Dubs_: Misono has a crush on her childhood friend Haruto and is obsessive with him, she also scares Saya into leaving her house after the latter claims to be Haruto's girlfriend.

-   In _Alien Abduction Role Play_, Acktreal Domma is an alien whose job it is to handle unknown species collected from other planets. She normally approaches her job in a very business-like manner, not making things harder or more for herself or for her subject than it needs to be. So it says a lot when she starts threatening to eat her human subject, but then admits to having feelings for them. She thinks that her desire to eat the human has been replaced by romantic feelings, but later on as she spends more time with them, the two get mixed up in her head, and she has at least two feral episodes wherein she tries to eat the human and her crewmates.
-   _Ascension Academy_ features Esmae, a spirit with a poor understanding of social conventions, lacking in empathy almost entirely, and with an unnatural draw and connection to Chipz. All of this mixed together created a potentially dangerous Yandere. During the First Year, Esmae was convinced to stab Chipz in the heart by Victor, claiming it would 'make him love her forever'. Thankfully Chipz is a vampire and survived the incident, though this effectively squashed her chances of actually getting with him as it destroyed his trust in her. Later in the Second Year after Chipz and Vevina became very close following a confession from Vevina, Esmae kidnapped Chipz, held him as sword point, and forced him to promise to stay in her room for the night. Because she is a spirit, it is dangerous to break a promise made to her, so he was forced to do so. Thankfully she slowly lost interest in Chipz over the course of the Second Year as it became apparent he had no romantic interest in her.
-   The Pope in _Breaking Providence_ is initially introduced as a Reasonable Authority Figure who sees Marcus as a chance to make up for her greatest failure. She agrees that the excesses of the church and nobility need to be curbed and makes a point of protecting Marcus after he frees a Dark General. However, as the story goes on, it becomes increasingly clear that she doesn't simply want to "make amends for not protecting Marcus's father"; she wants to be with Marcus at any cost and is convinced she should help him conquer the Empire, if not do it herself in his name<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Just before the end of the story, she tries to overthrow the Princess, whom Marcus has shown feelings for, just so she can rule in his name. After beng thwarted and imprisoned, she eagerly allows herself to be magically enslaved to him purely because it means she can be by his side, even if it means serving at his feet.
-   The Creepypasta Cloak and Dagger, in which a girl (probably) steps out in front of her crush's girlfriend's car, killing her when she swerves out of the road.
-   _Cracked_ noted in this article that the behavior of a woman who might follow _Cosmo_'s suggestions on intimate relationships could very well end up acting like this. The suggestions are downright possessive, obsessive, and overall psychotic. Everything from feeding a boyfriend laxative to crushing his testicles... all over perceived and potentially groundless possibilities of infidelity. At no point did any of the suggestions involve leaving the boyfriend; it was all about _punishing_ them.
-   The character of Rift from _New Vindicators_ seems like your usual young teacher/superhero until her obsession with Michuru comes out. Then people start dying.
-   _Obscured Eyes_: Played with. Daisy is obsessed with Isabella, and she wants her all to herself, but it's purposefully left unclear if Daisy also has romantic feelings for her.
-   _RPC Authority_: Invoked by Japanese Evil, Inc. Kabushiki Kawaii, who deliberately created a line of Brainwashed and Crazy Cyborg Sex Slaves to sell to men with a yandere fetish. One recovered by the Authority ends up falling for a female researcher, much to her displeasure.
-   _Shadow Unit_: Betty Johnson, the gamma of "Always Crashing in the Same Car." The crazy seems to have started because while she was pregnant, she walked in on her husband raping and killing a woman and subsequently miscarried. The first manifestation of her gamma powers was mind-controlling her husband into killing himself; every year since, she finds a man with the same name and mind-controls him into believing he's her husband. Then she commands him to kill himself on the anniversary of her first husband's death. Most of the episode is from her perspective, through letters she wrote to Reyes; she not only seems to believe that all the Tom Johnsons she married were actually the same man, but she insists to the end, even after being arrested and sent to Idlewood, that "our love is forever".
-   _SCP Foundation_:
    -   Taken to extremes with SCP-1805, a sex doll which comes alive when a man has sex with her and which considers the man to be her "husband". On the one hand, she's so devoted to her "husband" that she'll willingly let him mutilate and dismember her. On the other hand, she's so jealous that the man spending too much time with his _own children_ will make her go Axe-Crazy. And to put a final, weird twist to it, she instantly loses all interest in her "husband" the moment he dies, since marriage is, after all, "til death do us part".
    -   There's also SCP-1269, a mailbox which sits in front of a house in Massachusetts, USA. If a woman aged 23 or older moves into the house for SCP-1269, mysterious unaddressed letters, which are directed at the woman and highly romantic in nature, manifest inside the mailbox every four days. If you attempt to remove 1269 and replace it with a normal mailbox, both disappear, with 1269 appearing back in its usual spot and the other mailbox appearing in a dumpster 25km away with an extremely hostile and possessive letter inside it. SCP-1269 was recently kicked up to Euclid status when a male D-Class moved into the house with the female D-Class resident only to go missing some weeks later, his battered and mutilated corpse was found in the dumpster. Examples of letters found:
        
        1) _The color of your eyes reminds me of the depth and expanse of the night sky, a vast dazzling macrocosm of soft velvet and glimmering pinpricks of light._  
        2) _The wind was blowing and I thought it whispered your name sadly because that is what my heart is doing please write back_  
        3) _FUCK YOU YOU PILE OF PLASTIC AND WOOD SHE IS MY EVERYTHING YOU ARE NOTHING TO HER IT WAS A FLING AND I KNOW IT I'M DOING HER A FAVOR_  
        4) _YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A TOOL FOR HER USE BUT I AM MORE I AM HER EVERYTHING AS SHE IS MINE SHE USED YOU SHE USED YOU SHE USED YOU AND NOW YOU'RE WHERE YOU BELONG_  
        5) _WHAT IS A MAN BUT A PILE OF SHIT THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF MY LOVE HOW CAN SHE EVER LOVE YOU WHEN YOU'RE SO EASILY BROKEN SHE NEVER EVEN LET YOU TOUCH HER I SAW THE WAY SHE LOOKED AT YOU WITH HATRED AND NOW SHE WILL LOVE ME FOREVER_
        
    -   A less prominent example is told through an experiment log in the SCP-404 document, where a Class-D had a sexual relationship with a girl throughout their teen years, until she moved onto another guy, so he cut the breaks on his car and slit his throat when he crawled out of the wreck, and got arrested for it. The girl was the Class-D's sister by the way.
    -   SCP-962 is a giant steel tower that wants to help the "great ones" (humans) by mutilating, enslaving, and/or killing every non-human organism in the area around it. It also sends us "high quality" poetry.
-   "I'm sorry to god for what i have done. I love my family so I kill all my family. It's the only thing I can do to stay together with them F O R E V E R!"
-   Annabelle Wynters from Under the Van Gogh, though perhaps as a direct cause of Love Makes You Evil, Love Makes You Crazy, and some Manipulative Bastardry.

When it becomes clear that him and the Raxar are never going to happen, Jon builds a Colossus, moves it over the Raxar homeworld, and declares that it's "prom night."
