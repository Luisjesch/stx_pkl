_"Unbelievable. I usually fall for the whipped cream bikini every time."_

Ms. Fanservice approaches her target. Wearing her tightest blouse, she sidles up to him, runs her hand down his arm, puts on a soulful look, smiles at him sweetly, does the "push-up" thing to accentuate her cleavage...

And her efforts to seduce the guy fall completely flat.

Why? Usually because the intended "victim" is completely and totally above such things. Or maybe he just knows better than to play her game. Maybe he has absolutely no idea what she's doing. Or he's pre-occupied. Or he's just not attracted to her in particular, women in general, or anybody at all. Or, more simply, he is taken and is faithful.

May result in a request to Please Put Some Clothes On, depending on the nudity level of Ms. Fanservice at the time. Compare to Not Distracted by the Sexy, where people aren't intentionally ignoring the fanservice so much as they don't seem to notice it in the first place. If the object of seduction is an enemy, the seductress may ask Aren't You Going to Ravish Me?. Can play a part in a character's decision to Defect From Decadence. Often used in tandem with Ready for Lovemaking, to better subvert it. Contrast, Lust Makes You Dumb, where a character gets in trouble for letting their desire for sex control them.

    open/close all folders 

    Advertising 

-   A Coors Light commercial features a guy coming home to find lit candles all over the apartment, a trail of rose petals, and a note on the refrigerator written in lipstick saying "Come and get me". As he opens the fridge door, his girlfriend appears in the doorway wearing lingerie. He doesn't even notice her; he's too interested in the Coors Light "Cold Activated Window" beer in the fridge.
-   This is the trope IN AN ELEVATOR!
-   Played for laughs in an Arby's Roast Beef commercial. A group of construction workers are oblivious to the many pretty women who walk by but start hooting and hollering when a guy walks by carrying an Arby's bag.
-   An ad for the Windows phone shows a lady standing in front of her bed in a sexy nightie, trying in vain to distract her husband from his phone.
-   A Levi's Jeans commercial has a woman (after being unable to go into a women's bathroom to change her pants) go into the men's washroom and see a (seemingly) blind young man twirling his cane. She proceeds to change in front of him, then walks up to his face and zips up her jeans in front of his face (to no reaction whatsoever). She walks out of the washroom, and another man comes out of an adjoining stall. The "blind" kid hands the cane back to the older man (who is actually the blind one) and tells him he wouldn't believe what just happened.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Maeda from _Ai Kora_, who is only attracted to his "Ideal Parts". Even if a girl is trying to get his attention through normal sexual attractiveness if it has nothing to do with his Ideal Parts he shows no interest.
-   One chapter of _Ayakashi Triangle_ has Soga getting a wish from Rochka that he uses to stop getting sexually embarrassed around Matsuri. He doesn't flinch even when he ends up staring at Matsuri's bare breasts. Matsuri squeezes them around Soga's arm to see how much he can take, but then the spell wears off and Soga passes out as usual.
    
    **Soga**: My rival is a bit exposed. So what?
    
-   Sylvie Lumiere from _Baccano!_ is sexy enough to attract the attention of women as well as men. Maiza is completely immune, however.
-   In the _Battle Royale_ manga, Mitsuko Souma strips naked in order to try to seduce Kazuo Kiriyama, and later kill him. Kiriyama can feel no emotions, and Mitsuko's unoriginal plan not only fails miserably but backfires spectacularly when she is tortured and then shot in the face. Disturbingly enough, it does seem to have worked a little. This is the first (and almost only) time we ever see Kiriyama display clear emotion, smirking as he intentionally and repeatedly shoots to wound rather than kill.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_:
    -   Oriana Thompson learns the hard way that once he's pissed at you, Touma Kamijou won't stop pounding your face in no matter how sexy you're acting.
    -   Accelerator does this multiple times. At one point he tears a little girl's robe off in the middle of the street to confirm her identity and later walks into the same little girl and two busty older women in the bathroom. Both times, he is completely uninterested in the nudity.
-   _Code Geass_:
    -   During the Cupid's Day episode, one of Milly's plans to stop Lelouch involves putting a bunch of scantily-clad girls in suggestive poses in his way. However, "Lelouch" is actually Sayoko in disguise, and she just jumps over them. For extra comedy points, Sayoko says "Those bodies have no effect on me!", causing the appropriate confused reaction from the girls, and Lelouch asking her to "please quit making me say such things".
    -   And in the first season, Suzaku manages to tackle a completely nude Kallen to the ground after catching her bathing on a deserted island. He proceeds to... arrest her, looking only at her face. Would be a case of Not Distracted by the Sexy but he starts out the conversation by apologizing, presumably very much aware of the fact that she is naked, and then quickly forgets the "naked" part in favor of "charging me with a knife" part.
-   _D.Gray-Man_: Mimi tries to seduce Lavi in an attempt to do some spy work for Lulu Bell. He ends up ignoring her and paying more attention to Lenalee.
-   _Death Note_:
    -   Misa Amane goes to various lengths to entice her fiancé Light Yagami into bed. These include parading around in a corset and panties or a sexy nightdress. She also becomes quite frustrated when Light doesn't want to interact with her. Which is pretty much all the time, unless he needs her to do his dirty work.
    -   The only thing he _does_ notice is when she announces to L that he hasn't slept with her yet.
        
        **Misa**: There's no need to be so shy.  
        **Light**: _What?_  
        **L**: Yes, no need to be so shy, Light.  
        **Light**: I'm not!  
        **L**: No need to be so serious either.
        
    -   We also have Halle Lidner, who gets her kit off in front of Mello, a man she hardly knows, without hesitation. She then has a very suggestive shower, and offers Mello a place to stay, in a very seductive manner which as we all know can only mean one thing. Mello is completely unaffected by Halle's behaviour, and instead points a gun at her. This isn't the first time that Mello has ignored attempts at seduction from beautiful women: he shows no interest in the women snuggling up with the other mafia leaders, and it would seem that those women have learned not to bother with Mello due to his lack of interest.
    -   Earlier on, Light looks through pornographic magazines to fool the Kira Taskforce into thinking that _that's_ why his room is elaborately locked up. His response?
        
        **Light**: This is boring.
        
-   On several occasions, Chiho from _The Devil is a Part-Timer!_ has attempted to get Maou's attention via flattering clothing or revealing swimsuits that accentuate her pair of one-pound hamburgers. To her frustration, she never gets even a hint of a reaction. He's fully aware that she has a crush on him and what she's doing, but he's playing dumb to avoid hurting her feelings.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   In the very first episode/chapter, Bulma offers to let Goku feel up her butt in exchange for his Dragon Ball. Goku's response? "I don't wanna touch your dirty butt."
    -   Again, in the 21st Tenka'ichi Budokai, Ranfan whose entire fighting style relies on Fanservice to let the guard down of the predominantly male fighters, tries this on Nam, an ascetic monk. Nam, thinking about his villagers in the drought in his homeland, closes his eyes and quickly defeats Ranfan (although he was flustered during the match when she started stripping).
-   One of _Fairy Tail_'s running gags is that whenever Lucy tries to distract someone with her sex appeal, it never works. Lampshaded by Happy the one time someone is _finally_ Distracted by the Sexy in the anime.
-   _Food Wars!_ is rife with beautiful and sexy girls, but the titular protagonist doesn't care one bit about the blatant Male Gaze around him. He doesn't make a big deal after walking into the bathroom while Megumi is there, doesn't seem to care about Ikumi's Stripperiffic outfits, and when he accidentally bumps into Erina out of the bathrooms, he is only surprised to see her instead of looking at her cleavage or legs.
-   In _Full Metal Panic!_'s Beach Episode, Kaname specifically wears a rather revealing bathing suit in an attempt to get Sôsuke's attention. Unfortunately, he doesn't notice, which ticks her off (among other things that day).
-   Dungeonmaster's Girlfriend Kasukabe from _Genshiken_ puts on her shortest skirt, her tightest shirt and starts draping herself around Cloudcuckoolander Kousaka while talking to him in the sexiest way possible. His answer? "Thanks, but I'm going to line up for a videogame release in Akihabara."
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_:
    -   As Kyon is flirting with Mikuru, Haruhi kept trying more and more revealing attire, culminating in a partial bunny suit (as in, she wasn't wearing part of it, not that she wore it with something else) but was entirely ignored. This did not go over well with her.
    -   Kyon seems to ignore every aspect of Haruhi's fanservice-oriented outfits except for how socially disruptive they are to everyone else. "Seems" being the operative word, as he is a notoriously Unreliable Narrator.
    -   It's also possible that her troublesome behavior and attitude simply override any sexual appeal he (consciously) feels for her at this point.
-   _Hot Blooded Woman_: Downplayed with the resident Chaste Heroine Haji. Due to spending a long, long time with her incredibly attractive friend Hanseo, she's become completely immune to any pretty boy, despite the cast being full of them. Even if they try using their charms to lure her (in the case of Muhyeon - at first), she's also brainwashed by Hanseo enough to not notice anything other than thinking that they might be asking her for a duel.
    
    **Moya**: This is Hanseo?! No wonder Haji is immune to pretty boys...
    
    **Hanseo**: If she fell for faces, she would kiss my foot long ago.
    
-   This is the crux of the plot for chapter 175 of _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_. Kaguya finds herself in a lovey-dovey mood and wants to have some quality time with Shirogane, but he's trying to catch up on all his paperwork before the school trip comes up. He proceeds to ignore all her attempts to flirt with him, including braiding his hair, sitting on his lap, hugging him, and giving him a kiss on the cheek. Once he actually does finish up his work however, he proceeds to "pay her back threefold" for all her teasing.
-   In Episode 6 of _Kotoura-san_, Yuriko attempted to seduce her Childhood Friend Dai'chi multiple times. Dai'chi was plainly uninterested, to Yuriko's chagrin.
-   In the _Lupin III_ franchise, Jigen can usually be counted on to ignore the flirting women. But any of them _might_ ignore Fujiko.
    -   _Lupin III: Part II_: An episode has Lupin working for Fujiko's Aunt. After being incentivized to work by getting fanservice from a hologram of Fujiko, he starts to tune her out. When the _real_ Fujiko shows up, he completely ignores her.
    -   _Lupin III: Episode 0: First Contact_: Fujiko takes a shower in Jigen's apartment, comes out in just a towel, and tries to seduce him by leaning over to show her generous cleavage off, and then when he ignores that, starts to drop the towel. He uses the barrel of his magnum to hold it on her body while simultaneously threatening to shoot her if she tries that again. This is also a slightly defining moment for Jigen, as he is the only one consistently unaffected by Fujiko's appearance (even Goemon is affected; he just blushes and looks away when she's naked, though).
    -   _Lupin III: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine_: Jigen's Origins Episode has a similar scene where he at first pretends to be accepting her offer, then grabs the knife she was concealing and threatens her with it. He's also shown ignoring Ciccolina in his flashbacks.
-   When Alice makes an appearance in _MÄR_, all of the characters comment on how Stripperiffic she looks. Except for Ginta (her summoner), who never even seems to look her way. Even Babbo, who changes into the form, is embarrassed about it. Given that we _know_ he's a normal boy for his age (he makes several comments about Dorothy and very clearly has a crush on Koyuki/Snow), it makes you wonder. _Although_ it might have just occurred to him that gawking over Alice is technically gawking over _Babbo_, which he certainly wouldn't want.
-   When Killer Bee refuses to teach _Naruto_ how he learned to control his tailed-beast, Naruto tries to use the Harem Jutsu to persuade him... and literally gets the door slammed in his face for it, much to his surprise.
-   _Negima!_:
    -   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ does this a lot, given as the seductress' target is usually Negi, who is ten years old. The most obvious one is probably when Evangeline goes into full vamp mode, stripping him naked and dragging him into a bath with her and licking the cut on his arm. The attempt at seduction fails completely. Interestingly, his ability to Ignore the Fanservice becomes a plot point when School News Paper News Hound Asakura tries to give him a bit of Marshmallow Hell in order to make him expose his magic and Unmasque The World. He doesn't respond to this and sees through her disguise quickly. She's naturally insulted when he tells her quite frankly that her breasts seem small in comparison to her Disguise target (she was otherwise indistinguishable).
    -   In the Stealth Sequel _UQ Holder!_, an adult-looking Evangeline/Yukihime offers to allow main character Touta to gaze upon her naked body if he can pull the towel she is wearing off. He manages to remove the towel, but declines the offer to look at her because "he isn't interested in the naked body of an old lady".
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Zoro was the only one not to go peek at Nami and Vivi bathing. Even Vivi's own father and Parental Substitute went to do it! Zoro got lost on the way to the wall.
    -   This happens with Luffy when Boa Hancock is completely naked before him, with the first thing he says after seeing this is "there is no food back here", and then asking where is the food. Boa is both frustrated and disappointed at this.
-   Haruhi seems to be the only girl in _Ouran High School Host Club_ immune to the Host Club's charms, not that it stops Tamaki from trying. The only time she seems genuinely twitterpated is at the mention of fancy tuna.
-   In the Manhwa _Pervert Club_, Bo Eeni is a hot college student who is an unabashed pervert. She purposefully doesn't wear underwear and will expose herself while pretending not to notice she's doing so because she loves the looks on men's faces. She's immensely frustrated at the complete and utter failure of all her efforts to get a reaction out of Du-Jun, who hates perverts... because his dad is a pornographic film director and a huge pervert.
-   Jin in _The Pet Girl of Sakurasou_ blatantly ignores Misaki's advances. He does love her though, but finds himself unworthy of her.
-   In _Please Twins!_, Mike ignores all the fanservice provided by... well, every single female in the series. Therefore, they logically conclude that he is gay (he isn't). Hilarity Ensues.
-   In a very early episode of _Pokémon: The Series_, a battle comes down to Ash's Metapod (cocoons capable only of hardening themselves to defend from attacks) and his opponent's. In the middle of this stalemate, the camera cuts to Misty in a bathing suit getting some sun. Those must have been some really dedicated trainers to not notice _a girl changing clothes right next to them_. Then again, one of those trainers _is_ Ash, the poster boy for Chaste Hero.
-   During Mousse's introductory story in _Ranma ½_, Ranma, who is stuck in female form, tried to pass off her girl body as an elaborate disguise meant to humiliate the Chinese martial artist — going as far as to equate his Hidden Weapons style as magic tricks and dressing up as a Playboy Bunny magician's assistant. Mousse was so enraged that he systematically destroyed Ranma's (already scant) clothing, leaving her wearing nothing but shoes and a few centimeters of fabric on her crotch and derriere. The Fûrinkan audience was crying tears of joy, but Mousse remained fully focused on tearing the remains of the "disguise" to pieces. (It doesn't hurt that while Mousse is Blind Without 'Em, he's almost blind even _with_ his glasses on.)
    -   Subverted in the manga, when Ranma converts one of his unisex outfits into a bikini so that guys will want to take him out on a date and buy him lunch. When this doesn't work, he's horrified, thinking that he's no longer appealing to men. But as it turns out, there just aren't any men on the beach, because the owner of the island forbade any males to be there.
-   One episode of _Goku Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_ subverts this, with a group of men not interested on Kaere's panty shots... because they're more interested in anime girls' panties. Japan's government hires them to keep State secrets because they're immune to Honey Traps.
-   Blair in _Soul Eater_ is always trying to seduce Soul, to no avail. Although he notices it in the first episodes, he gradually becomes used to the skimpy outfits and boob hugs. Even though he is always insisting he is "cool" and that "cool guys like girls with big boobs" he never actually does anything with Blair.
-   Happens once in the first series of _To Love Ru_. When Saki wants to "beat" Lala by stealing her boyfriend, she tries to seduce Rito with a Marilyn Maneuver scene. However, Rito is too busy and totally ignores her.
-   _Yakitate!! Japan_ does this with Suwabara Kai and Monica. She tries to wreck his concentration by stripping to a bikini; he counters by stripping to his loincloth and the Cooking Duel continues.

    Comedy 

-   There's a classic joke about a female student who is failing her class, and came up to her male teacher, behaves suggestively around him and tells him that she'd do _anything_ for him to get her to pass the class. His only request is for her to study harder.
-   Another joke goes like this: A friend asks a man how he got such a cool motorcycle and the man says that one day he was just minding his business when a beautiful woman drove up to him on this motorcycle, jumped off it, tore off her clothes, and told him, "Take what you want." The friend nods in approval at this explanation, saying, "Good choice. The clothes probably wouldn't have fit."

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   The page image with Harley Quinn comes from _The Batman Adventures_. The context is covered in more detail in the Western Animation adaptation below.
    -   Batman himself is an example. The only woman who can _consistently_ mess with him in the first place is Catwoman, and his attraction to her will _not_ stop him apprehending her (if he feels she's earned it; a lot of things Selina does are illegal, but done to stop something worse from happening).
    -   In _Robin (1993)_ Tim is immune to attempts at distracting him with flirtations and sexy wiles, which frustrates some of his opponents like Lynx who tried to get him to let down his guard by flirting to no end. It irritates some of his allies too, like Kon-El when Tim's reaction to some sex-bots of attractive women in the Teen Titans and Justice League is to blow them up.
-   When Ava Lord of _Sin City: A Dame to Kill For_ allies with Wallenquist, he tells her, "I'll warn you once and only once, Mrs. Lord — do not flirt with me. I have no use for your charms." Interestingly, despite being the most powerful crime lord in the city and having a number of drop-dead gorgeous women who work for him such as the assassin Mariah, Herr Wallenquist is never shown being involved with any woman (or man, for that matter), implying that he's completely uninterested in sex in general.
-   _Superman_:
    -   In _Superman: Brainiac_, Cat Grant suggests that Clark should get Lasik since surgery worked wonders for her (while not so subtly showing off her augmented chest). Without ever taking his eyes off her face, he replied, "I didn't know you used to wear glasses." Amusingly enough, after several panels of Clark looking her in the eye, she stops and checks her breasts, presumably to make sure they're working properly.
    -   In _Smallville_ Season Eight comics, Bruce Wayne deduces that Superman is "taken" after witnessing a rescue and notes that "there were over forty women in that crowd, and his gaze didn't deviate once. Superman or no, he's still a man."
-   In _X-Wing Rogue Squadron_, Soontir Fel, the best Imperial pilot alive, is assigned to a corrupt admiral who pushes a scantily-clad woman at him, telling him to "enjoy her" rather than keep going over the defenses of the world. Fel says his wife would not approve, the admiral says that neither would _his_ wife, but no-one would know. But Fel would, and he's much more interested in plans for defending the planet from Rebels. This is basically a sort of Pet the Dog for him. Most fans would also note that Fel's wife is much hotter than the woman the corrupt admiral was offering.
-   In an issue of _Fantastic Four_, Reed and Sue get into a fight over this. Sue changes her costume to an outfit that is outright Stripperiffic, but Reed, while he notices the new suit, simply concentrates more on his work and asks when the roofers were supposed to arrive.
-   A Played for Laughs example in _New X-Men_: During Stryker's assault on the school, Dust stumbles out of her room in her underwear because X-23 knocked her out and stole her abaya<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  to sneak after Jay, of whom she was suspicious. Rockslide sees her and immediately freaks. Not because Sooraya is quite attractive and she's currently in her _underwear_, but because he's not allowed to see her _face_!
-   _Vampirella_: In Issue #36 of the Brandon Jerwa run, Vampirella's allies express discomfort in her more ruthless approach to building her monster kingdom. When Vampirella's boyfriend Adam goes to talk to her, she suggests they have sex instead. Adam, while finding the proposition tempting, refuses and insists they have their talk.

    Fan Works 

-   The East Clock Town Guard in _The Blue Blur of Termina_, who not only didn't buy Tatl's halfhearted attempt at flirting with him but actually threatened her with imprisonment if she persisted.
-   _Child of the Storm_ plays with this as far as Harry (who starts the story at 13) is concerned. While he's rather clearer headed around attractive women/pretty girls than most straight boys his age even to start with and has a typically Gryffindor chivalrous streak, he's still a Hormone-Addled Teenager. He learns to do this by chapter 68, thanks to sheer embarrassment brought on by a mixture of Darcy's habit of glomp hugs and somewhat intimate psychic training with the famously gorgeous Betsy Braddock (who, thanks to a psychic connection to her twin brother, has basically Seen It All and instead finds it amusing, and his embarrassment endearing). Peculiarly, this actually increases the UST between him and Carol, as it's yet another sign that he's a genuine Nice Guy who puts their friendship first, rather than a 'nice guy'. For his part, after chapter 70, she's more or less the one person who can reliably elicit a flustered reaction from him, up to and including a Crush Blush.
    -   Betsy also drops a Modesty Towel in front of Peter Wisdom twice when she first meets him. The first time is to judge his character (since she can't read his mind thanks to his shields), and he explains that even if he wasn't too tired to do anything, he's dealt with The Fair Folk and other supernatural beings that use sex as a distraction before and knows not to fall for that trick. The second time she does it is just to get on his nerves.
-   Lampshaded In _Death Note: The Abridged Series (kpts4tv)_:
    -   Later when Misa snuggles up next to Light wearing nothing but a Black Bra and Panties:
    -   Takada strips down in front of Mello and Mello's response is to donate her clothes to charity.
-   _The God Empress of Ponykind_: The Emperor ignores Slaanesh's attempts to seduce him before running her through with his sword.
-   _The Headhunt_ has a scene where Dul'krah, Clan Korekh interrogates a half-Orion mafia capo who tries to turn her chemically assisted feminine wiles on him. He No Sells it, having prepared for the interrogation by getting himself injected with a chemical that blocks her pheromones.
-   Shirou Emiya in the _Fate/stay night_ and _The Familiar of Zero_ Crossover _The Hill of Swords_ is able of doing this to incredible amounts, managing to ignore the attention seeking of Kirche, Siesta, Tabitha when the latter isn't reading AND Eleonore who turns out to be a _closed masochist_ who started loving him after he treated to _murder_ her if she won't stop (she didn't). It goes so far that Kirche glomps Shirou, pressing her admirable chest against his head and he resumes the conversation he's holding as if nothing happened.
-   Tsunade in the NSFW story _Kage Sexbomb_ outright gropes Naruto who reacts with open anger that she's trying to waste his time by distracting him while he's training. While he _is_ interested, when Tsunade claims any man in a five-mile radius would literally kill to be him right now, Naruto retorts that she might see Hokage as a worthless title, it means everything to him and since he's not a prodigy like others, he has to train as much as he can to reach said title.
-   _The Last Prayer_: Multiple women try to seduce Naruto for various reasons and all fail because they think they're seducing a hapless virgin, not someone who has very regular sex with two beautiful women (though not at the same time). While a flash of cleavage might be distracting for some, Naruto barely even glances.
-   In _Mabel in Butterhurst_, Sebastian isn't entertained by Naomi's "tight-fitting dress" as a normal twelve-year-old boy would be...however, he reveals immediately afterwards he's not a normal twelve-year-old boy (see the Really 700 Years Old trope on the work's page).
-   _The Night Unfurls_: In the original version, Shani attempts to seduce Kyril twice by showing skin. Kyril, on the other hand, merely focuses on conversing and is disinterested in her advances. As expected of a Celibate Hero who won't react when interacting with Ms Fanservices.
-   In _A Protector's Pride_, Ichigo shuts down Rangiku when she tries to tease him with her body in order to stay at his place. As Ichigo puts it, he is the sometimes assistant of a doctor and knows Yorichi so she has nothing he hasn't seen before; furthermore, while sex with her would no doubt be mindblowing, he's far too tired to care right now.
-   In _Total Drama Comeback,_ Heather lures Ezekiel away from anyone else and kisses him. We then get a Confession Cam segment where she talks about how easy it will be to manipulate a simpleton who has no experience with girls...and then another segment with Ezekiel, noting that he's fully aware of what she's doing because _duh,_ he already knows that she hates him. That said, they're dating by the end of the story.
-   In _Can't Have It Both Ways_ Fleur Delacour decided that Harry was her ideal mate and hit him with a blast of Veela allure while he was walking to class. His only concern was finding Hermione so she could help him figure out what was wrong with the stupefied Neville who was standing right next to him.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_: Any attempt from Tea to seduce a male character is either encountered with this trope or obliviousness.
-   _The Red Dragon's Saber_: This is discussed when Artoria Pendragon faces Raynare and her Fallen Angels. Artoria thinks the Fallen Angels wear skimpy outfits to distract their opponents and tells herself that her Knights of the Round Table are too disciplined for that to work. Or at least she _hopes_ they are.
-   In _This Bites!_, Cross has forced himself to do this a few times, especially whenever his female crew members try to get a rise out of him by showing some skin.
-   _With This Ring_: After Bleez answers Paul's long-distance call wrapped in a towel — before seeing his girlfriend and hurrying off to get dressed — Paul explains to Jade that she frequently does things like that, but as he's an empath, he can tell that she's not serious about it, just following orders from her superiors in the Thanagarian intelligence service. She's a decent friend, but not actually all that into him, which he finds to be a turn-off.
-   _Vow of the King_: Like canon, Rangiku flirtingly implies she'll sleep with Ichigo if he lets her stay at his house. As Ichigo has been sharing a bed (both platonically and sexually) with Nemu, he's completely uninterested.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Ice Age: Continental Drift_: Used with Scrat against the Sirens. While they nearly successfully lured the other characters with various appealing opposite-sex characters, when they try it on Scrat with Scratte, he looks for a moment, only to then turn away to continue searching for the acorn treasure. The siren then immediately turns into an acorn, which then does get his attention. It backfires when Scrat accidentally kills the siren while trying to bury the "acorn." This causes all the other sirens to attack him, but Scrat escapes.
-   _Tangled_: While being held captive by Rapunzel, Flynn tries to charm her into letting him go with a pretty-boy pouty face he calls "the Smolder". Rapunzel, who has no experience with romance in any capacity due to her sheltered upbringing, just stares at him in confusion.
    
    **Flynn:** (_mid-smolder_) This is kind of an off-day for me, this doesn't normally happen.
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Chieko's story in _Babel_ is a dramatic example.
-   When Bunny tries to seduce The Dude in _The Big Lebowski_, his reaction is mostly one of baffled amusement. When he sees her in a porn film, later on, he seems more interested in fixing a drink and jokingly misinterpreting the plot ("Lord, you can imagine where it goes from here." "He fixes the cable?"). Even when he eventually _is_ seduced by Bunny's "stepdaughter," Maude, he seems more bewildered than anything else.
-   _The Big Sleep_:
    -   The crazy younger sister turns up in Marlowe's bed, but he gets her dressed and drags her home. She's homicidally angry with him for turning her down.
        
        **Marlowe:** She tried to sit in my lap while I was still standing up.
        
    -   The older sister puts the moves on Marlowe too, but less blatantly. She also gets upset when turned down, but she's not as histrionic as her sister.
-   In the 1971 British horror film _The Blood on Satan's Claw_, Angel Blake tries to seduce Reverend Fallowfield, but being a good man of the cloth, he pushes her away.
-   In _The Cannonball Run_, the Lovely Angels pair driving the Lamborghini have been using their assests to avoid speeding tickets and other consequences of their reckless driving. This works fine till they are pulled over by a female trooper.
-   Roxie Hart of _Chicago_ briefly tries the seduction route to get Billy Flynn to represent her, until he informs her, "You mean one thing to me and one thing only. Call me when you get 5,000 bucks."
-   In _The Clones of Bruce Lee_, Bruce #2 is completely unaffected by the naked prostitute he finds in his hotel room. Good thing, considering she was an assassin sent by Dr. Ny to assassinate him.
-   In _Clueless_, Cher attempts to seduce Christian. Unfortunately, he's not really into girls.
-   In _Cruel Intentions_, Sebastian successfully seduces Cecile, the woman that Kathryn originally bet he would be able to sleep with. Kathryn later tells Cecile how to learn the art of sex from Sebastian. Cecile, in turn, tries to seduce Sebastian by climbing on top of him half-dressed while he's working. Sebastian literally shoves Cecile off the bed like a toy and keeps typing.
-   In the 1987 movie version of _Dragnet_, Joe Friday rejects a topless model and only acknowledges a stripper hovering over him with a polite "Ma'am". He falls for \[The Virgin\] Connie Swail because she is every bit as straight-laced and ultraconservative as him, which also explains why he didn't pay much mind to the earlier fanservice (though, when pressed, he had to admit the aforementioned model's breasts were quite lovely... bordering on spectacular.).
-   2005's _Fantastic Four (2005)_. Susan Storm arrives explaining the outfits that would later be adopted as those of the FF and wearing her own so that it nicely exposes her cleavage... and it for a moment it looks like Reed Richards is astonished by how good it looks on her... until he starts proclaiming how impressed he is with the materials they are made out of, and how they are designed to correspond to the group's molecular structure. Cue a displeased look from Sue.
-   _Gentleman's Fate_: Mabel (Marie Prevost) is sending out all sorts of mating signals to Mike, one of Frank's minions. In one scene she comes out in a tight dress, turns around, and obviously and deliberately shakes her bottom at him. He does not pay attention, instead focusing on his game of solitaire.
    
    **Mabel**: Well you might take a look!  
    **Mike**: At what?  
    **Mabel**: At me!
    
-   In the (musical) film adaptation of _Hairspray_, Velma attempts to seduce Wilbur, meeting with utter failure, so she resorts to physical force to put them in a compromising position for his wife Edna to see.
    
    **Wilbur :** My heart only beats for size 60.
    
-   In _Hitman_ the protagonist agent 47 receives very direct approaches by Nika, but he just doesn't want to be bothered (and, being engineered from birth to serve as an assassin, probably doesn't have much of a sex drive anyhow).
-   _James Bond_:
    -   James turns down Bibi (Lynn-Holly Johnson) after she shows up naked in his bed, offering herself to him in _For Your Eyes Only_. Apparently she's supposed to be too young.
    -   In _Diamonds Are Forever_, Blofeld orders Tiffany Case to put something on over her bikini so his henchmen won't get distracted.
-   _Jason's Lyric_: When entering the restaurant where his love interest, Lyric, works at, Lyric's vain co-worker with a heaving buxom, Marti, welcomes Jason and his friend, Rat, in a seductive manner. But, Jason is oblivious as he's immediately distracted by Lyric's beauty.
-   _Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle_: When the heroes must sneak into a vehicle warehouse being guarded by some gun-toting Mooks, they decide to have Ruby flirt with them as a distraction. Since Ruby is the avatar of Shrinking Violet Martha, Bethany needs to give her pointers on how to seduce guys, which becomes awkward considering that Bethany's own avatar is the short, fat, and male Professor Shelly Oberon. But when Ruby/Martha finally gains the confidence to put the moves on the guards, she discovers that they're only programmed to say stock phrases and _can't_ respond to anything, fanservice or otherwise—so she cuts the knot by beating them up instead.
-   In _Kingpin_, two corrupt bowlers fix a tournament by stationing Ms. Fanservice next to the lane to throw the other bowlers off their game. A farmer in denim overalls isn't at all flustered... until one of the characters produces an adorable baby lamb.
-   _Life Blood_: When Brooke and Rhea enter the gas station, Rhea tells Brooke to distract Dan, the clerk, while she closes the blinds. However, Dan knows that if two gorgeous, scantily clad women enter his station and one of them starts flirting with him, then he's about to be robbed, and panics.
-   In _Mad Max: Fury Road_, the group comes across a naked woman atop a tower screaming for help. Max, the only man present, immediately refers to her as "bait". He’s right. Said woman is a member of the Vuvalini, the tribe the group was searching for as Furiosa is a descendant, and the only reason the group wasn’t caught in an ambush was that they recognized her as one of their own.
-   Classic example in _Malice_: Nicole Kidman's character starts playing footsie with Bill Pullman's under the table, telling him in a breathy voice how she misses him and still wants him, to which he coldly replies "I think you dropped your shoe."
-   _Mean Guns_: Crow is the only gangster who seems perfectly cognizant that Barbie is a liability who will turn a gun on them the first chance she gets, only letting her tag along with him and Hoss because they can use her as bait. His partner is not as wise.
-   In _Moulin Rouge!_, Satine's blatant acts of sexiness are ignored by Christian, but not because he isn't interested.
-   In _The Naked Gun 33 1/3rd_, Tanya tries to distract a guard. She tries the old flash the leg, spinning the shoulder straps of her dress around, but none of it works. She finally gets him by seductively playing with bubble wrap. He shoos her away from the bubble wrap and begins playing with it himself.
-   In _Plan B_, Bruno strips down to his underwear while getting ready for bed and saunters out to meet Pablo in a clear attempt to seduce him or at least get confirmation that he's attracted to him. Instead, Pablo only glances briefly at him before turning off the lights and heading back to his own bedroom, leaving Bruno staring after him in confusion.
-   In _Planet of the Apes (2001)_, Leo pays absolutely no attention at all to the drop dead gorgeous Daena even after she puts the full liplock on him. He _is_ attracted to a female ape from the same film, however, which might cast some aspersions on him...
-   One of the jokes in the song "Bad Jokes" from _A Prairie Home Companion_:
    
    _Gramps turned 90 the other day, everybody was there  
    We were all gathered around him, sitting in his big armchair  
    When a beautiful young naked woman stood up in front of the group  
    She offered him some super sex and he said "I'LL TAKE THE SOUP!"_
    
-   In _The Producers_, as Max and Leo return to their office after the premiere of _Springtime For Hitler_, Ulla approaches Max in a zebra stripe bikini, and excitedly asks, "We make love?" Dejected over the failure of his Zany Scheme, Max rejects Ulla's offer, and tells her, "Go to work." She then breaks out into a sexy dance, as Max trained her to do whenever he said that phrase, but he and Leo don't stick around to watch.
-   In _Scary Movie 2_, Theo attempts to vamp Dwight to get the keys to escape the haunted house. It doesn't work. Not because he isn't attracted to her, as he gets quite aroused by her flirting, but because he takes her offer to "help him out" the wrong way. Dwight, who has to use a wheelchair, refuses help from anyone, so he just starts blowing himself. She has to knock him out to get the keys.
-   _Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation_: Captain Dax, a disgraced but still veteran soldier, is approached by a female trooper who wants to bed him in order to implant him with an alien parasite. He rejects her advances and instead orders her to do 200 push-ups so she can work off all her "excess energy" as he nonchalantly walks away.
-   The Rebbe's son does this to a female undercover cop in _A Stranger Among Us_.
-   There is an ignored naked girl waiting in the bed in _Trading Places_. The prostitute is also mostly ignored in many (not all) scenes.
-   The scene in _True Romance_ in which Clarence confronts Alabama's ex-pimp, Drexl has a pretty nifty example. Drexl informs Clarence he has taken no notice of the pair o' titties on the tv screen next to him, which he says shows that Clarence is focused entirely on him and thus is likely terrified instead of the composed tough guy he's pretending to be. He's partly right; Clarence is indeed a complete novice at intimidating criminals, but he nonetheless responds with a neat retort that among other things explains both yes he has noticed, and no he does not care. Of course as a Quentin Tarantino hero he's already seen the movie and can rattle off its title and release date.
-   In _U Turn_, the protagonist Bobby finds himself stranded in a weird crapsack town in the middle of the Arizona desert. Among other annoying people he encounters is a reasonably attractive (Claire Danes) local girl (her character may or may not be underage, though—she certainly acts like it) who keeps throwing herself at him, perhaps as a possible ticket out of town. Even though he keeps rebuffing her, her interest provokes the jealousy of her hotheaded boyfriend, who keeps getting in Bobby's face for it and ends up causing him problems.
-   In _Warlock: The Armageddon_, the Warlock picks up a promiscuous woman on the road, who then makes a pass at him in his car. He doesn't react at first but eventually responds by scalping her and throwing her out.
-   _Waterworld_ "You have nothing I need". Those were the Mariner's words when a woman offers her body if he'll agree to spare the life of the little girl she's charged to protect.

    Literature 

-   In _Agatha H. and the Airship City_ by Phil and Kaja Foglio, Princess Zulena declares that "There's no male guard on this ship that can resist a beautiful and oh-so-lonely princess." She's wrong; one of two scenes where the princess gets her comeuppance.
-   In Raymond Chandler's novel _The Big Sleep_, a beautiful young lady turns up naked in Philip Marlowe's bed and tries to seduce him. He states that his blood is just as warm as the next guy's, but the girl is involved with his current investigation and obviously has a few screws loose. Plus he's angry that she broke into his private dwelling. He tells her to Please Put Some Clothes On and forces her out the door. She takes it very badly indeed.
-   In Aldous Huxley's _Brave New World_, the Savage makes a concerted effort to ignore what Lenina is offering.
-   In _The Demon Princes_ final volume _The Book of Dreams_, Alice Wroke is under orders from the villain to seduce Kirth Gersen, who has had four books worth of experience in situations like this already. He spends several chapters either ignoring her Sexy Secretary outfits or telling her to cover up.
-   In the _Doctor Who Eighth Doctor Adventures_ novel _Camera Obscura_, the first chapter concerns Noble Demon Sabbath meeting his Morality Pet _du jour_. She's a violent, troubled, crazy teenage girl. Being used to men sexually harassing her, she decides to Show Some Leg to get him interested, as she's in a Bedlam House and would like to leave. He ignores what she's doing until she gets bored with it. When she suggests that he might have prurient motives for hiring her, he's neither startled by nor interested in it. By the end of the book, it's implied that they're having some sort of chaste love affair.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   Harry Dresden frequently encounters beautiful but dangerous beings.
        -   In Harry's first encounter with Lady Maeve, the youngest of three Queens of the Winter Fae Court, involves her in a young and nubile body and summoning her handmaiden from a pond, naked and very perked up. In exchange for engaging in sex and offering his first child as payment, Harry would be given the information he seeks. It takes some cold water dropped on his groin to help resist, but Harry says no.
        -   Lara Raith is a high ranking member in her father's White Court of Vampires<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . She is capable of seducing many a man to her chamber with ease. Each time her business with Harry could lead to sex, Harry refuses. Even after Lara tries a We Can Rule Together idea, saying she has more than enough "food" from other mortals, Harry rebuffs her advances. He is the first one she has sought in over a hundred years to do so.
        -   In the first book, when reporter and love interest Susan Rodriguez accidentally drank a love potion instead of an escape potion and wound up trapped in a magic circle with an acid-spitting toad demon outside and a dosed-up Susan making forays into attempted rape inside.
        -   For several years Harry endured the Shadow of the Fallen Angel Lasciel in his head. Her sole purpose was to get Harry to fully accept her true form into his body. She typically took the form of a tall, beautiful woman, or even at times other women Harry finds attractive as part of her seduction. Harry resists her temptations the entire time.
        -   When Harry saves the young woman who would become his apprentice from a bad situation, she hopes this would be the start of a Rescue Romance. She even presents herself to him fully naked. For Harry, this is a no-go because not only is she just short of 18, she is also the daughter of a dear friend who he sees as a mix between father-figure and big brother. Harry tosses a pitcher of cold water on her to point out it won't happen.
        -   In the fifteenth book _Skin Game_ Harry encounters a powerful fire-using warlock named Hannah Asher, who has a very hot body. She flirts with Harry as well, but he shuts her down and references many of his past experiences with beautiful but deadly women as a reason.
    -   The human John Marcone, the ruling crime boss of Chicago, over the course of the series becomes deeper entangled into magical affairs. At one point the aforementioned Lara Raith offers to make their business go to the next level. Marcone refuses, making him the second man in more than a century to say no to her sexual advances.
    -   Magical mercenary Binder has two base rules to live by. The first one is "No Personal entanglements." For this reason, he won't engage in some sex with his current partner, the aforementioned Hannah.
    -   Played for Drama when Thomas Raith, Lara's brother, falls afoul of this trope offscreen at the beginning of _Dead Beat_. Being an incubus, he's incredibly sexy but can't turn this off. This leads to a female employee at a job he's working at attempting to force herself on him, and his getting fired when they're caught in a compromising position. Sadly, this happens all too often in real life (see the folder below).
-   In the first _Warhammer 40,000 Gaunt's Ghosts_ novel _First and Only_, Major Rawne and his adjutant are negotiating with some local gangsters for contraband, ignoring a nearby stripping dancer in the process.
-   In the Forgotten Realms series, Obould, a King of Orcs which is a species not highly thought of in most works would have the most beautiful of his species dance and rub against him while he was eating and he would ignore them just to show how in control he was.
-   In _Heart In Hand_, Darryl is completely indifferent about women trying to flirt with him. The biggest example of this was him being hit on by a gorgeous woman who was able to tie a cherry stem into a knot with her tongue and ignoring all that in favor of proving that she wasn't as big a hockey fan as she had claimed to be. Being attracted to exactly one person (who happens to be a man) over the course of the story will do that to you.
-   In _Magic's Pawn_, of Mercedes Lackey's _Heralds of Valdemar_ series, a tavern wench tries to seduce protagonist Vanyel while he is en route to the city of Haven. His complete disinterest surprises her — and more importantly, him, because thanks to some rather bigoted parents, he's been sheltered all his life from knowing about homosexuality.
-   Ward of _Hurog_ several times - he simply doesn't like sex without love.
-   Subverted to hell and back in _Gottes Bodenpersonal - eine unwahrscheinliche Liebesgeschichte_: A female \-presenting hooker is annoyed by a guy who hands out flyers about the evils or prostitution to her customers. She tries to get rid of him by seducing him. He ignores it. She goes and fetches an underage male hooker, intending to expose the man's hypocrisy. Doesn't work, either. When she's attacked by a customer, the annoying preacher guy saves "her" and finds out "she" is actually male-bodied. When they later meet, the hooker now male-presenting and not fanservice-y dressed, the other man is suddenly a lot _more_ interested.
-   In _The Twisted Thing_, Mike Hammer finds a naked woman Ready for Lovemaking in his bed, but doesn't take up the invitation. He mentions afterwards that she went about it the wrong way, as he likes to be teased a little.
-   In Terry Pratchett's _Mort_, when the title character knocks on Ysabel's bedroom door, she quickly adjusts the neckline of her nightgown to be a bit more revealing, then invites him in. Mort simply tells her to follow him, since he needs her help looking something up in the library. As he heads out, he adds, "And put something on, you're overflowing."
-   Robert A. Heinlein
    -   In _The Number of the Beast_ this is how Zeb and Deety clue to the fact that the "park ranger" accosting them is an alien; Deety's abrupt striptease does not distract him or even engage his interest.
    -   Also in _The Puppet Masters_ (book and film). Heinlein's standard litmus test for identifying non-humans usually involves boobs. Fair enough.
-   Though one would hesitate to describe it as "literature", there is a scene in which a waitress in a tavern is trying to seduce the main character of _The Orb of Xoriat_ (she is actually trying to get him to ask her to dance, but sex is implied in later conversation). She has a disproportionately-excessive response (leading a band of assassins to him) later in the book.
-   In _Shadow of the Conqueror,_ Tuerasians have _very_ lax modesty standards, so having the self control needed to pull this trope off is an important virtue among them.
-   In _The Shadow of the Lion_, Lucretia resents that Eneko and Marco spurned her advances despite magical aphrodisiacs. This is just another reason for her to kill them as painfully as possible.
-   Many Jedi in the Star Wars Expanded Universe. Most notably Corran in _I, Jedi_ — the Big Bad tempted him, and he thought about it, but he didn't bite — and Luke's son Ben in _Invincible_. In the prequel era, Anakin, of course, manages to Ignore the Fanservice from anyone but Padmé.
-   In _Stone of Tears_, Richard demonstrates that he can ignore the fanservice while shooting arrows at a target — right up until the fanservice starts to give him a handjob.
-   In Plato's _Symposium_, Alcibiades attempts to seduce Socrates, even going so far to literally sleep with him, but fails because Socrates is above such things. This makes this trope Older Than Feudalism.

    Live-Action TV 

-   On _30 Rock_, Jenna was shot down trying to use her cleavage to get into a restaurant.
    
    **Liz:** How long is the wait?  
    **Maître d'hôtel:** About 45 minutes.  
    _(Jenna unbuttons her blouse)_  
    **Jenna:** _(in a sultry voice)_ Are you sure about that 45 minutes?  
    **Maître d'hôtel:** _(a little bemused)_ Yeah.
    
    -   Although the joke there is that _not_ getting her a table actually allows him to stare at her chest for 45 minutes.
-   _Babylon 5_:
    -   In "GROPOS", Garibaldi backs out of sex with "Dodger", a very hot little pistol of an infantrywoman who was just seeking a little R&R sex before going off to the trenches for battle and to her death because he had (unrequited) feelings for Talia.
    -   Sheridan completely blows off the advances of Ms. Musante, the political officer recently assigned to him, while she is undressed in his quarters, in "Voices of Authority". He does kiss her at one point, but that's just to distract her from a hologram of his second-in-command appearing in the room. Once that's over with, he takes one look at her, declares that it must be colder in here than he thought, and leaves on the pretext of adjusting the thermostat.
        
        **Musante:** I've never known who a man who could find so many ways to say "no" to a simple proposition.
        
-   In _Barney Miller_, the squad encounters a High-Class Call Girl - she's the victim of a semi-related crime - who throws herself at Dietrich to a ridiculous extent. As it happens he's trying to swear off sex and does his best to ignore her. When she tries to test out her seductive new perfume on him, the normally sardonically good-humoured and virtually unflappable Dietrich snaps, "Lady, will you _**get your stinking hand out of my face?**_"
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_: Shelly Godfrey (actually a Number Six Cylon) tries to seduce Commander Adama, but this only makes him suspicious of her.
-   _The Big Bang Theory_:
    -   In "The Big Bran Hypothesis" (Season 1, episode 2), the guys are working on building a TV shelf from Ikea, and are paying no attention to Penny. Trying to get their attention, Penny mumbles that she'd take off her clothes. Silence ensues as the boys ignore her.
    -   In "The Dumpling Paradox" (Season 1, episode 7), the guys are playing _Halo_ when Penny walks in with a bunch of lady friends and says that they want to have sex. The guys don't even seem to hear her and continue playing, to which Penny then tells her friends "Told you so." Leonard pauses the game ten seconds after they have left, thinking he heard "something."
    -   In "The Contractual Obligation Implementation" (Season 6, episode 18), the girls go to Disneyland and come back dressed as the Disney Princesses. Bernadette and Penny easily turn on Howard and Leonard with their costumes, but Sheldon ignores Amy.
    -   In "The Cooper Extraction" (Season 7, episode 11), several What If? scenarios are depicted. In one narrated by Amy, Penny is trying to seduce Sheldon. When stripping down to her bra and shorts, all Sheldon says is that her breasts look asymmetrical.
-   Xander succeeds against the entire female cast of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ in "Bewildered, Bothered and Bewildered" when a sex-appeal spell has been cast on him. "Buffy. No, please don't open that raincoat." Also an example of Above the Influence as the females of the town are under the influence of the spell (which Xander cast). Buffy herself is occasionally shown ignoring cute guys as a sign that she's in a funk, such as in her opening musical number in "Once More with Feeling", in which she dismisses a bare-chested model offering to "repay" her for saving his life. "Whatever."
-   _Burn Notice_: While not an intended seduction, when Fiona misinterprets Michael saying he's 'coming over' she opens the door wearing nothing but an open shirt over her underwear and holding a glass of wine... and Michael and Sam just stroll past her while tossing off a casual greeting. Sam spares her one glance, Michael doesn't even _look_ at her.
-   In _CSI: NY_, Mac Taylor's ability to remain completely focused on his job when said job lands him in a room full of half-dressed Roller Derby queens, one of whom is visibly trying to throw herself at him, is nothing short of impressive. That said, though, he does have practice.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   In "Rose", the Doctor first meets Jackie Tyler while she's in her dressing gown. A fact that Jackie gleefully notes, saying that "Anything could happen." After a brief pause, the Doctor simply says "no" and leaves the room.
    -   Amy attempts to seduce the Doctor at the end of "Flesh and Stone". The Doctor refuses because he realizes she's just having an extreme case of pre-wedding jitters and really loves her fiancé (and in general, he shows pretty much zero sexual interest towards her at all).
-   Topher from _Dollhouse_. Joss Whedon apparently enjoys this trope.
    -   This trope goes for all the dolls, at least in "inactive" mode. The Dollhouse is filled with incredibly hot and fit young men and women who do everything from yoga, massages and _showers_ together, but their child-like minds make them impervious to this. So it triggers a real double take when one of the male dolls, Victor, gets an erection.
        -   The one guy in the Dollhouse who can't ignore the fanservice is considered as one of the series' most depraved villains.
-   _Firefly_: Mal attempts to do this to Companion-trained Saffron in "Our Mrs. Reynolds". He fails: "Oh God, I'm going to the special hell." Wash succeeds, though. But then again, Wash beds down with his Amazonian Beauty wife every night (who, as he reflects, can kill him with her pinkie), while Mal sleeps alone pining after the gorgeous hooker. Also, Mal is married to Saffron (or thinks he is, at any rate), while Wash is of course married to someone else.
-   In _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_, Phillip was too busy with his work to notice that his wife was wearing nothing but plastic wrap in an attempt to seduce him. Later averted when he replays the day in his mind, just realized what she was wearing at the time, and goes to ask her to give it another try.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Stannis Baratheon seems to have this reputation, given what Queen Cersei has to say about him when asked what she would do if he and his men managed to claim the capital.
        
        _The Red Keep would hold for a time. Long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. Where it anyone else outside those gates I might have hoped for a more private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon — I'd have a better chance seducing his horse._
        
    -   This also happens with Tywin Lannister — he goes to coerce Oberyn Martel into being a judge during an important trial. Oberyn is mid-orgy at the time, but Tywin doesn't even change his facial expression as several naked, attractive whores walk past him.
-   _The George Lopez Show_: In "Trick or Treat Me Right", Angie wears a sexy police officer costume for Halloween but George is too depressed over his mother's recent insults about his dyslexia as well as her general habit of insulting him. Ernie, on the other hand, is more than happy to show his appreciation.
-   In a late-episode _Get Smart_, Agent 99 tries to distract a KAOS agent with a sexy come-on and is stunned when he just walks by. After 86 subdues him and is then worried when he finds he's not an agent, 99 tells him they're safe, as his eyesight wasn't that good.
-   In one episode of _Ghost Whisperer_, Melinda is dressed in a low-cut nightgown as her husband Jim comes home from work dead tired. He's too tired to notice when she slips it off...until she crawls into bed with him.
-   _Gossip Girl_'s Serena van der Woodsen tries to orchestrate a cunning scheme in season three, to expose Jenny's boyfriend Damian as a sleaze and make her dump him. The idea is for her to do her usual Ms. Fanservice thing and Nate will walk in with Jenny just as Damian is throwing himself at Serena. She fails to take into consideration that Damian might not want to jump her bones the first chance he gets, and the plan of course fails.
-   _Hell's Kitchen_: Some female contestants have tried to get a leg up by seducing Gordon Ramsay. They've all failed miserably.
-   In one episode of _Hogan's Heroes_, a German scientist tries to seduce Carter (who is pretending to be a chemical weapons specialist), even plying him with wine. Fortunately for Carter, he's the only Chaste Hero of the group and finds her advances scary. Good thing too, since the wine is poisoned. The scientist is a defector.
-   Robin goes nuts in _How I Met Your Mother_ in an attempt to seduce Barney into a one night stand (which should be an easy feat given he's The Casanova). Her attempts range from everything from a laser tag Lara Croft outfit to Girl on Girl Is Hot to outright showing up at his door in lingerie. He doesn't even notice. He was holding out because his ultimate goal was a lot bigger than a one night stand.
-   This happened in an episode of _The Love Boat_ when some of the passengers and crew were held hostage. First, guest-star Barbi Benton tried to seduce the hostage-taker. When he states that "I like the blond one", Julie tries, but also to no avail.
-   _The Office_: During a talking head in Season 9, Dwight says he fast-forwards past the nudity in _Game of Thrones_...to get to the beheadings.
-   In season 2 of _Parks and Recreation_, Leslie is the judge in the Miss Pawnee pageant, but ends up extremely disheartened when everybody else on the panel votes against her and give the award to the dumb-as-a-brick (and kind of racist) hot girl instead of the much plainer but also smarter and more accomplished contestant Leslie likes. This trope comes up when Louis C.K.'s character comes by to try asking Leslie out again (despite her blowing him off earlier over his ignorance of important women in politics); he brushes past the hottie everyone else is fawning over without giving her a second look (just a " 'scuse me, buddy") and Leslie decides to give him a chance after all.
-   In _Rome_, Cleopatra VII, the woman who succeeded to keep her kingdom by seducing both Gaius Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony, tried to use her wiles on Octavius, Caesar's successor and the new Emperor of Rome. In response, he is polite, understanding, charming, and _not fazed for even a second by her come-ons_. While Octavius is shown to act out some sexual kinks with his Roman wife, he is definitely more interested in pursuing power than lust. His patriotism is also so strong that he looks down on the idea of bedding a foreign queen. Cleopatra's response to this is well known.
-   _Scrubs_:
    -   Happens when Jordan tries to seduce a boy from across the hall. He is nice to her, calls her "ma'am", and leaves. In utter Ma'am Shock, she gets so much botox that she can barely talk.
    -   Also happens to Perry. Heather Locklear as the pharmaceutical rep that Perry hates just based on the fact she works for a drug company trying to seduce him to prove a point. It doesn't work, but then she out and out tells him she's interested in him, and they end up in bed and a short rel'p the ends when Perry's pregnant ex-wife shows up, wanting Perry back.
-   In _Selfie_, Eliza points out she's "always being eyed" when Henry mentions being eyed for a promotion. He says that she means it a different way, and she challenges him to try not to look. She then begins dancing provocatively while he ignores her. It is then subverted at the very end, where he just glances at her rear a little, and she catches him looking.
-   _Sex and the City_:
    -   When Samantha has nude pictures taken of herself she was grievously offended when the photo developer made no comment on them. Later, a delivery guy notices said picture on her wall and receives a 20 dollar tip when he compliments her ass.
    -   Happens to Charlotte, when she gets a sexy nightgown to try to arouse some interest from her husband Trey. He's dismissive, telling her that the nightgown just isn't her. She is able to get his attention when she starts touching herself, however...
-   When Irene Adler, sexy dominatrix extraordinaire, tries to seduce Sherlock Holmes in the BBC's _Sherlock_, his response is to check her pulse and look to see if her pupils are dilated, so he'll know if she's actually attracted to him. Also, when she shows up Naked on Arrival, he calculates her exact body measurements using his Sherlock Scan — which he uses to deduce the combination to her safe.
-   In _Smallville_:
    -   "Nicodemus'': Lana tries to seduce Clark and Lex with little success.
    -   "Heat": Desirée ineffectively tries to seduce Clark. And, shortly thereafter, Jonathan is unimpressed with her nudity. Her meteor power is another story.
    -   "Rush": Played with. Chloe at first succeeds in getting Clark to make out with her, but once the red kryptonite is removed, he barely gives her a second glance.
    -   She does it again in "Devoted", wearing nothing but his football jersey, then plants a Forceful Kiss on him.
    -   She does it again in "Escape", when she ambushed him in the shower, completely naked.
-   Spartacus's masters, in their various efforts to manipulate or reward him, repeatedly send the slave Mira to spend the night with him, but each time he rejects her, as his heart belongs to his estranged and later dead wife Sura.
-   An episode of _Spin City_ had the team trying to get a new chair for the office, but the guy in charge wouldn't give it to them because they had broken it by racing in the corridor. When the girls tried to seduce him, he didn't even look up. They decide that he is gay and send Carter after him, but he quit in disgust before they could confirm it.
-   _Everyone_ does this with Vala in _Stargate SG-1_.
    -   Daniel finally relents in the series finale, when he realizes she wants more than just a roll in the hay. They end up an item... and then hit the Reset Button.
    -   The same applies with Anise of the Tok'ra, in spite of the outfits she wears.
-   On _The Thin Blue Line_ Patricia tries to improve her sex life with Raymond by coming to bed in a silk nightie. Unfortunately, it doesn't get his attention until she mentions how much it cost...
-   In _Twin Peaks_, Agent Cooper finds Audrey Horne naked in his hotel bed. He's not interested, though, as she's too young for him.
-   Parodied in _Yes, Dear_. Kim tries to seduce Greg so she can get pregnant again to no avail. After she leaves, Greg pours ice down his pants.

    Music Videos 

-   In the video for "Call Me Maybe" by Carly Rae Jepsen, she tries to get the attention of a hunky guy she likes by washing a car sexily (and hilariously). It does not work as he is gay, as she later finds out when he gives his number to the (male) guitarist of her band.
-   Stevie Ray Vaughan does this during the guitar solo in the video for "Cold Shot". His wife (who is fat an not very attractive) comes in in a skimpy outfit and tries to get his attention. When he ignores her, she grabs his guitar out of his hands and starts smashing it. Stevie just reaches behind the couch, grabs another guitar and continues playing.
-   Whitney Avalon's video "Let's Not Talk About That" has Whitney sexily dancing alongside Jordan Maron, only for Jordan to be more interested in talking about political topics then dancing.

    Mythology & Religion 

-   Another Older Than Feudalism example: Joseph, in The Bible, was repeatedly approached by the wife of his master Potiphar. Since sleeping with her would've betrayed his master and God, he refused her over and over. Finally, she attempted to rape him outright, then accused him of same when he ran off to escape her.
-   Possibly the Ur-Example would be Gilgamesh completely rejecting the Goddess of Love Inanna/Ishtar because he's heard her lovers tend to go through some hell once she's done with them. Of course, spurning her doesn't get him into her good graces either...

    Professional Wrestling 

-   The Jeff Jarrett/Owen Hart team was managed by Debra, who used her looks to distract their opponents and help them gain wins, as she had no actual talent to rely on if needed. So, Jarrett/Hart won a Tag Team Title shot against the Big Bossman and Ken Shamrock of The Corporation. Pat Patterson forced Bossman and Shamrock to drink saltpeter, which, as he put it, "makes you keep the right head up and the other one down." It worked, but Jarrett/Hart still found a way to win the titles.
-   Stacy Keibler had some of those when she first came into the WWF and was manager/distraction for The Dudley Boys.
    -   In one match, she pulled up her short-shorts and wiggled her ass at Jeff Hardy. He responded by smacking her rear end, causing her to fall off the ring apron.
    -   She tried the same tactic during a match where the Dudleys were challenging Billy & Chuck (who were doing an Ambiguously Gay Duo gimmick) for the tag team titles. She wiggled her ass at Billy Gunn, who just waved his hands at her like he didn't care. She got offended and hit Billy with one of the title belts, causing the Dudleys to lose by disqualification and prompting them to fire her as their manager by driving her through a table.
-   "Your mammary glands don't impress me," as said by Kane to Trish Stratus.
-   "The Lethal Weapon" Steve Blackman defended the WWE Hardcore Title against Albert (w/Trish Stratus) on the October 5 (taped October 3), 2000 _WWE SmackDown!_. Trish started taking off her coat to distract Blackman, who proceeded to drown her in fire extinguisher spray, and then did the same to Albert, en route to winning the match after a flying kendo stick shot.

    Roleplay 

-   In a side-story for _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_, Melissa tries to get it on with her boyfriend Daigo while he's busy painting. He distractedly ignores her advances... until she says that she'll just find another guy to sleep with, which triggers the Crazy Jealous Guy in him.

    Theatre 

-   _Damn Yankees_:
    -   Lola declares in-song that she's irresistible and has an accompanying strip-tease routine. Only this time with Joe, what Lola wants, she doesn't get.
    -   The other ballplayers have a comic song all about keeping their minds off sexy women: "The Game."
-   In _Cat on a Hot Tin Roof_, Maggie walks around in her lingerie, trying to get her husband, Brick, to have sex with her again. However, he's disgusted by her and refuses even to touch her.
-   Cirque du Soleil's _Zumanity_ had a segment where a (world-class - seriously) pole-dancer tried to get her husband's attention away from a football game, to no avail.
-   Quickly forgotten in the ten million cover versions, but this is the basic plot behind the song One Night in Bangkok.
    
    _I get my kicks_ above _the waistline,_ sunshine!  
    

    Video Games 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_ has Dahlia Hawthorne, who leaves every male character she meets lovestruck... except for Miles Edgeworth. Although she doesn't so much do fanservice as cuteservice.
    -   In the first game, Edgeworth and Phoenix are both immune to the charms of April May. Though Phoenix was originally intended to get "heart eyes" when she turned up on the stand.
-   This happens in _Batman: Arkham City_ between, ironically, Batman and Catwoman. Catwoman, who has a very obvious crush on Batman, walks around with a very revealing costume, flirts with him, and even saves his life at a pivotal moment in the storyline. Batman ignores her in favor of Talia. He ignores Catwoman much less in _Batman: Arkham Knight_, but even then, he isn't swayed much when she asks him outright to sleep with her.
-   In _Final Fantasy VI_, a woman in a bar tries this on Cyan in the first town you reach after the Phantom Forest. He brushes her off because his wife and son were poisoned about an hour ago by Kefka. Poor timing.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   In _Genealogy of the Holy War_, Sigurd met up with Sylvia, a Dancer who tried to flirt with him, and he completely dismissed her as just a kid that should just hide, despite showing off her... assets, probably because at that point he's a married man (with Deirdre) and a fully devoted husband. An omake spoofs this, as recounting the experience to Levin, Sylvia concludes with, "I knew it, he's gay."
    -   In Fates Prince Xander completely sees through all of Charlotte's attempts to flirt and seduce him in their support chains. Mostly because he's already heard and read reports about her. Their first interaction is actually him reprimanding her for this exact behavior.
-   Regime Superman in _Injustice: Gods Among Us_ displays little interest in Regime Wonder Woman slinking into the room wearing a revealing dress, even though they are sleeping together. This is due in large part to his lingering feelings for Lois Lane.
-   In _Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories_, Larxene flirts with Axel near-constantly and has zero respect for his personal space. He doesn't blink twice. Of course, Larxene isn't _really_ flirting with him as much as trying to get on his nerves, but Axel's too cool-headed to get annoyed.
-   _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_: In a cutscene, Snake launches into Description Porn upon being handed a custom-made 1911 pistol — completely disregarding the woman who gave it to him, who just moments ago stripped half-naked, expressly for his benefit. If you look at her, she's actually slightly peeved at this when he starts gushing about the gun.
-   In the humorous adventure game _Nippon Safes Inc._, resident Ms. Fanservice and Femme Fatale Donna tries to seduce a hotel concierge (who for some reason looks like Spock with a five o' clock shadow) but it turns out he's gay.
-   In _Resident Evil 5_, Excella Gionne is introduced in her Stripperiffic dress, touching all over Big Bad Albert Wesker, talking about their plans and claiming she's interested in something "much _bigger_" and glancing down right before sliding her hands down to below his waist level. He really doesn't care. In fact, he shuts her up and gets her to leave, much to her annoyance.
-   It's a miracle Sonic or Shadow manage to ignore Rouge's multiple attempts at seducing said hedgehogs. It gets to the point of questioning Shadow's sexuality for the fact that he teams up with her on a multiple basis and hasn't even looked at her Stripperiffic outfit, while she was fighting, flying, or whatnot.
    -   Shadow hasn't looked at Rouge's outfit because he's too busy staring at what it covers.
-   Downplayed for _Super Robot Wars_: Kyosuke Nanbu does appreciate and love his girlfriend Excellen Browning. It's just that he tends to ignore her Ms. Fanservice aspects.
    -   From the same franchise, Sanger Zonvolt isn't easily distracted from any fanservice shenanigans even if it's from the resident Innocent Fanservice Girl, Kaguya Nanbu, or even from Morrigan Aensland.
-   Any role that has Roleblock immunity in _Town of Salem_.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Grisaia Series_: Yuuji tends to do this whenever Amane tries to seduce him. At one point he walks in on her changing (in his room), and responds by blatantly ignoring her state of undress, grabbing a drink from the fridge, and talking to her normally.

    Web Animation 

-   _Red vs. Blue_: The Reds find an underground camera system that happens to show Sister's physical examination. Sarge and Simmons are quite interested, Grif screams at them to stop looking at his sister and Donut complains about the blue base having much nicer lighting than theirs. And Doc, who's _administering_ the physical, is too busy trying to work around Sister's gratuitous posing.
-   During the episode "Lewd Lingerie" of _Neurotically Yours_, Germaine's second attempt at screwing with guys in the store (the first time resulted in a guys head exploding) is met with no interest. Because it's Franklin
    
    **Franklin:** Please bitch, I'm here shopping.
    

    Webcomics 

-   _The Order of the Stick_:
-   When Gwynn parades around in a belly dancer outfit in _Sluggy Freelance_, Riff is more concerned with that fact that Dr. Schlock stops breathing once he sees her. So Riff tells Gwynn she looks fat.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Tedd tries to argue with his father based on Grace's exposed skin. Mr. Verres casually tells her to button up.
-   Fa'Lina in _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_ will occasionally flaunt her large breasts, often when she's trying to lighten the mood; she gets frustrated when no one seems to notice.
-   Ignoring the Fanservice isn't something at which the cast of _Ménage à 3_ are very competent, but...
    -   Zii has a spectacularly hard time doing so when supposedly advising Sonya what to wear for a date with Gary — not surprisingly, as Sonya is actually taking the opportunity to try and seduce Zii.
    -   Also — "Hello? Naked girl upside down on a pole here!" (7th July 2009, NSFW). Sandra and DiDi get men in a _strip club_ to ignore the fanservice.
-   In _Plume_, local Hooker with a Heart of Gold and quite an eye candy Tegan attempts to seduce Corrick, whose only reaction is mild irritation.
-   In _Girl Genius_, the titular genius and Mad Scientist Agatha is working on an invention to save the lives of Gil and Tarvek, her two suitors. Gil is shirtless, Tarvek is completely naked after previously only being in a bedsheet. She completely ignores Gil's lack of shirt, and apparently no-one involved notices Tarvek's lack of pants until someone else points it out.

    Web Original 

-   _Can You Spare a Quarter?_: Graham pretends to not notice or turns down all of Jamie's attempts to flirt with him. Graham understands that the kid has survived on the street, in part, by selling himself for sex and is thus not surprised, but he does not reciprocate.
-   In the 7th _Chrono Hustle_ story while Jack Masterson is attracted to Aphrodite, her beauty and nudity don't impede his ability to think clearly, and he is completely immune to her seduction powers.
-   The basis of "Roadside Ass-istance", a "PG-rated porn film". And yes, it was made by James Gunn.

    Western Animation

-   ''American Dad!':
    -   In one episode, Francine tries to sweet talk some CIA scientists into giving her a top-secret formula. She tries brushing the straps of her dress off her shoulders, and shimmying off her panties and tossing them at the scientists, but they don't react at all. When she mentions she has _brownies_, however... BROWNIES!!
    -   In another episode, Steve and Roger are trying to find inspiration to write an erotic novel while eating at a diner, where they're attended by two skimpy blond waitresses. As they constantly keep running into boring ideas, the aforementioned waitressess get into increasingly erotic situations in the background involving fixing an air conditioner. Neither Steve or Roger pay them any attention.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_:
    -   The episode "Mad Love" shows Harley Quinn trying to get the Joker's attention by wearing the skimpiest red night dress that could **ever** have been allowed on a children's cartoon and lying suggestively in front of him seen here. He roughly shoves her away, too absorbed in his plans. Later, Harley gets closer to killing Batman than anyone else in the series because Mr. J spends more attention on ''him'' than he does on her.
    -   There's also the scene in "Beware the Creeper" where she celebrates their anniversary by rising up out of a giant pie covered in banana filling, and it's ambiguous whether she's wearing anything underneath (other than her hat). She's also singing "Happy Anniversary" like Marilyn Monroe and asking him to try some of her pie. The Joker promptly throws her out, telling her to quit fooling around and find the Creeper.

First, she attempts to seduce the bodyguard outside Bieber's dressing room by flashing him; he responds by saying "I'm not into that", leading her to bribe him with frozen yogurt instead. Then, when she gets inside Bieber's dressing room, she attempts to seduce him by saying "I'm your mom's friend, Mrs. Robinson". When Justin fails to get the reference, she tries again and says "I'm Stifler's mom", but again, the reference goes over his head.
-   _Futurama_:

    -   In the episode "The Prisoner of Benda", Bender steals Amy's body so to utilize her body to seduce a guard. This fails the minute he encounters Basil, who as a robot obviously isn't going to be distracted by a human woman. Bender has to resort to punching him out.
    -   In "Zapp Dingbat", Zapp Brannigan loses interest in Leela and instead turns his attention towards her mother, Turanga Munda (who just divorced her husband), but Leela thinks that is just an Operation: Jealousy.

    -   In "The Six Million Dollar Mon", Fry is trying to eavesdrop on Hermes and Bender's conversation, and Leela and Amy are showering together, trying to get Fry to help them.
        
        **Leela:** Fry, could you come in here and rub on this new scented body oil?  
        **Fry:** In a second, I'm eavesdropping.

    Real Life 

-   According to comedian Eddie Griffin, a theater was showing two movies once when he was a kid. One was a porno, the other was a Bruce Lee movie. Guess which one was completely empty?
-   St Thomas Aquinas was once captured by his family and was ordered to stop pursuing a religious vocation with the Dominicans. One of those attempts to dissuade him, devised by his brothers, involved bringing in a harlot to seduce him because they believed that a liaison would be enough to force him to stop pursuing his vocation out of shame. However, the moment the harlot tried to seduce St Thomas, he grabbed a burning brand, drove her away, and traced the sign of the cross with the brand. Afterwards, St. Thomas went into prayer and was said to have fallen asleep while two angels girded him with a white cord. From that day forward, St Thomas never experienced even the slightest motions of lust.
-   J. Michael Straczynski said that Shari Shattuck was disappointed in him for not being on set when her nude scene in the _Babylon 5_ episode "Voices of Authority" was filmed. He explained that Craft Services was serving ribs for lunch that day, and after a man gets past the age of forty he'll think "Nude woman... ribs... nude woman... ribs... RIBS!" (Come to think of it, Captain Sheridan's reaction to the nude scene in-universe is an example of this trope too.)
    -   Hayley Mills reported this when she made the transition from teen star to adult actress- she was embarrassed and shaking at doing her first nude scene, then noticed the sound man was doing a Crossword Puzzle.
-   Some men have been fired after turning down advances from their female boss. However, given the often gendered nature of sexual harassment policies, this can be difficult to prove.
    -   In one case, a man was groped and hit on by a woman during his lunch break in a bowling alley, then returned to his workplace to find _he_ had been accused of sexual harassment. Luckily, he was able to use the security camera to prove his innocence.
    -   The novel and film _Disclosure_ examine this phenomenon.
