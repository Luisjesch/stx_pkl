I've got my eye on you...

If a character is deranged or has just lost it for a moment, one eye is drawn as being very different than the other. Commonly, the Mad Eye (or its iris/pupil) is much larger than the other. Can also double as an unspoken Oh, Crap! moment. For extra effect, may be paired with Twitchy Eye.

    Anime & Manga 

-   When she gets angry, Revy in _Black Lagoon_ has clear white irises, to accentuate her inner turmoil.
-   Whenever someone is emotionally broken in _Elfen Lied_(which is _often_) they get these, along with a Kubrick Stare.
-   Just about everyone in the _Hellsing_ manga.
-   _Solf J. Kimblee_ in a late chapter of _Fullmetal Alchemist_ when he's telling Pride about how screams are soothing to him.
-   A favorite shot of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_' resident Mad Scientist, Jail Scaglietti, when he's taunting the Time-Space Administration Bureau via broadcast.
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_ has a lot of "emo-distortion" expressions, Mad Eye being just one of the effects. Rika busting this out in the second season is truly a sight to behold.
-   Kurt Godel from _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_
-   Marik of _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ did this from time to time, though he was crazy all the time, and this was because it was his dark side.
    -   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! R_, Yako Tenma has this going on at least once in just about every one of his appearances after his Start of Darkness. He's not quite right in the head, in case you couldn't tell.
-   The entire cast of _Deadman Wonderland_ exhibits this, sometimes as their default expression. It fits since most of them are clinically insane to some degree.
-   Ryuga does this quite often in _Metal Fight Beyblade_. It succeeds in making him appear quite off his rocker (and he is).
-   _Vassalord_: 86 has this as his default expression. And when 86 gets serious somehow his eyes get even crazier looking!
-   Chuck from _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ has one large white eye and a smaller black one.
-   _Tokyo Ghoul_ has two variations of this.
    -   Protagonist Kaneki Ken has one, as a result of being a Half-Human Hybrid. His right eye remains normal, but his left is prone to giving away his Ghoul nature. He frequently wears an eye-patch to conceal it. (It turns out to be a tell-tale sign of any Half-Human Hybrid, known as One-Eyed Ghouls.)
    -   Kureo Mado, a sadist CCG Investigator obsessed with killing Ghouls to produce new anti-Ghoul weapons, has one lazy eye and one that is almost always bulging.
-   _Sword Art Online_: Sugou Nobuyuki/Oberon's right eye bugs out<small>◊</small> while he's gloating to Asuna in episode 18. That same eye later gets this treatment in the real world after Kirito stabs him through it with the Pain Absorber set to zero; it's permanently bloodshot, with visible veins/scarring extending in all directions from it<small>◊</small>.

    Comic Books 

-   _Johnny the Homicidal Maniac._ Quite a lot of the time, really. But then, he's insane quite a lot of the time.
-   Anything by Jhonen Vasquez has this.
-   _The Mask_: \[1\]<small>◊</small>
-   Falling under the "Deranged Character" subset are The Joker's eyes as drawn in _Batman: RIP_. There, one of his pupils is drawn slightly larger than the other, giving him a dangerous and mentally off-kilter look. The effect is so slight that it's only noticeable in close-up shots of the character, but it's definitely there. Then again, he is a Monster Clown with enough crazy to fill Arkham Asylum's halls ten times over.
-   Most Returners in _Dead Eyes Open_ seem to have one eye permanently open with a shrunken pupil.
-   A specialty of Alan Davis. In the classic Detective Comics story "Fear for Sale", he combines this with an Expressive Mask.

    Comic Strips 

    Films — Animation 

-   In _9_, 6 has one eye slightly larger than the other as a permanent feature, confirming his Cloudcuckoolander status.
-   In _An American Tail: Fievel Goes West_, Wiley Burp teaches Tiger how to intimidate someone using "The Laaaayyyyzzzzyyy Eyyyyye!" which is essentially an intentional evocation of this trope.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _The New Guy_, Luther teaches Dizzy his "Crazy Eye" which consists of squinting one eye and opening the other wide.
-   _Pirates of the Caribbean_
    -   Ragetti's wooden eye has this effect. It's too big for his socket, the wrong color, and always pointing away from his real eye.
    -   Many of Davy Jones' crewmen also have mismatched human and sea-creature eyes, notably Maccus the shark and Koleniko the pufferfish.
-   When Ellie comes Back from the Dead at the climax of _Pet Sematary (2019),_ her right eye has a blown pupil and won't focus on anything without her conscious control, drooping down otherwise.
-   _Valley of the Fangs_: One of the film's lesser villains, Sun Lan, has a huge bulging eye in all his scenes. It looks like this.

    Literature 

-   The aptly named Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody from _Harry Potter_ has a magical replacement eye. It's bright blue, the size of a golf-ball, has 360 rotation and can see through just about anything. It's also virtually never looking in the same direction as his other eye.
-   The unnamed old man in _The Tell-Tale Heart_. One eye, due to some deformity, is described as a "vulture eye" with a film over it. However, the eye drives the old man's _roommate_ to insanity (whether this roommate is their servant, their apprentice, a caretaker or even their spouse is never mentioned).
-   The Scarecrow from _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ is described as having one eye larger than the other (accompanied by mismatched ears) due to poor artistry on his creator's part. He never really loses his cool at any point in the book, and he is never depicted as any crazier than the rest of the Ozians, so it might be considered Subverted.
-   The Red Right Hand of the mercurial Serial Killer Karkas in _Galaxy of Fear_ is that he has one "crushed" eye.
-   _Scorpion Shards_: Everyone maddened by Dillon gets one dilated pupil and one pinpoint pupil.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   _Hogfather_ brings us Jonathan Teatime, a Faux Affably Evil and thoroughly insane member of the Guild of Assassins, whose Glass Eye is the _less_ scary one. The one that still works has an abnormally tiny pupil; he's described as "\[looking\] at the world through a pinhole". Even his boss Lord Downey, a man who in the prologue accepts a contract on the local equivalent of _Father Christmas_ from a mysterious hooded spectre, finds him rather unnerving.
    -   Carcer, a particularly violent armed robber who Sam Vimes was pursuing at the start of _Night Watch_, doesn't stop at just _one_ Mad Eye. At one point he's encountered by a cavalry officer who immediately and correctly pegs him as a dangerous madman:
        
        _He'd seen eyes like that on the battlefield._
        

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Roger Delgado's portrayal of the Master is very handsome and charming but has strikingly different eyes. One is always much wider than the other, which is unfocused and almost squinted. The effect is very disturbing.
    -   The Fourth Doctor's eyes do not quite ever point in the same direction, which is a really big part of how mad he looks. (The actor is perfectly capable of pointing both his eyes in the same direction when not in character.) His pupils are also noticeably off-centre.
    -   The Tenth Doctor also has slightly asymmetrical eyes. When one fan gave David Tennant's mother a painting they'd done of him with Self-Fanservice strongly averted, she commented that it was a bit boss-eyed, to which Tennant replied, "Face it, Mum, I _am_ a bit boss-eyed."
    -   In _The Invasion_, Vaughn's right eye is half-closed through most of the serial, until he turns against the Cybermen; after that, it's wide open.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Having a literal Mad Eye is Older Than Print: Cuchulain, the Irish folk hero. Whenever he went into one of his unstoppable rages, one of his eyes would get smaller and the other would get bigger. " ... he sucked one eye so deep into his head that a wild crane couldn't probe it onto his cheek out of the depths of his skull; the other eye fell out along his cheek." Now _thats_ a Mad Eye.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Brian Pillman, after he became a loose cannon. Though it was more like a madman with a lazy eye, rather than anything exaggerated.
-   Cibernético has a split right pupil. And though he has had his bouts with madness, this is more a sign of, well, being a Cyborg.
-   Kane had one on Monday Night Raw after unmasking. One eye was an icier blue with a smaller pupil.
-   Kzy of Dragon Gate seems to have the same affliction Kane does. More noticeable in fact because Kzy's other eye is brown.
-   As seen in the National Wrestling Alliance, Wrestling Is, Chikara and such, Sinn Bodhi's right pupil tends to become an X.
-   Cedric Pain in Reality OF Wrestling has a tiny left pupil.

    Puppet Shows 

-   The Vigar puppet on _B.R.A.T.S. of the Lost Nebula_ was the first one with different sized eyes to be approved by Brian Henson.

    Tabletop Games 

-   One _Paranoia_ mission has a General Ripper who "glares at his subject with one bulging and one squinting eye: paranoid fear and clinical suspicion".

    Theme Parks 

-   The Ghost Galaxy in _Space Mountain: Ghost Galaxy_ has one skeletal-eye-socket and one giant blue nebula-eye.

    Video Games 

-   King K. Rool from the _Donkey Kong Country_ game series has one eye that is often bloodshot, and tends to bulge out.
-   _Earthworm Jim_: Jim himself.
-   In the re-render of _Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories_, Vexen gains one of these.
    -   Master Xehanort seems to have a rather nasty case of one in the 2.5 remix cover art.
-   Laverne from _Day of the Tentacle_ has one eye bigger than the other permanently. Which one depends on what side of her head you're looking at.
-   Similarly, Doug Rattmann from the _Portal_ games has one pupil permanently larger than the other. He's also a paranoid schizophrenic.
-   The female model for the Malkavian clan in _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines_ has two different colored eyes—one blue, one yellow. Malkavian vampires are "enigmatic and deeply disturbed," marked by their clan's curse to suffer from some form of permanent madness, and have a history of acting as a higher-up vampire's on-call Mad Oracle. In the game, if you're to play as a Malkavian, all of your dialogue options are expressed through Cryptic Conversation and Word-Salad Humor, as well as gaining the ability to know information before anyone's told you and predict future events.
-   Whenever Glottis from _Grim Fandango_ gets excited about cars, or customizing something else with a motor or wheels, or gambling, he goes crazy-eyed, rapidly switching from one side to the other.
-   In the Creepy and Cute pack for _Spore_, one of the added emotes (for the creepy side of things) is a version of this. Hilarity Ensues when _your creature is covered entirely in eyes._
-   In _Nintendo World Cup_, characters would get this when stunned by a tackle.
-   _Plants vs. Zombies_:
    -   Crazy Dave. He's craaaaaazy.
    -   All the zombies in the game also have larger left eyes.
    -   The Strawburst plant in the second game has a staring right eye.
-   For some reason, Liara in the _Mass Effect_ series is often shown with one eye squinting slightly more than the other, prompting many a joke along this line.
-   Chris Redfield on the cover of the original _Resident Evil_ portrays this trope. Curse those zombie dogs.
    -   In _Resident Evil 7_, in the message Mia leaves for Ethan during the flashback to her escorting Eveline on the ship, one of her pupils is much larger than the other.
-   The Agents of Doom from _Ratchet & Clank_ sport mismatched eyes, to go with their slasher smile and tendency to giggle.
-   Incorporated into the designs of several of the animatronics from _Five Nights at Freddy's_. In the first game, Foxy has one normal eye under his eyepatch and one drooping eye; in the second, the Mangle has one eyeball and one tiny glowing light on each head.
-   When you face off against Sans in _Undertale_, his left eye changes from its normal "all black with a tiny iris of blue light" appearance to the blue expanding to give him the appearance of a glowing blue iris set against black sclera and a pinprick pupil, whilst his right eye remains normal. Given the fight only takes place if you're undergoing the Genocide route, it emphasizes just how hard you pushed him over the edge.
    -   Seam in _Deltarune_ has a large button for his right eye, giving him this effect.
-   In _Pillars of Eternity_, the mad priest and Token Evil Teammate Durance's profile resembles an ash-covered Grigoriy Rasputin, but with his left eye visibly bulging. And he is quite nuts, an eloquently hammy preacher of a goddess of flames and struggle whom he angrily calls a whore for abandoning him.
-   _Pizza Tower_ has Peppino, whose eyes are regularly drawn mismatched to reflect how he is either crippled by anxiety or insane with fury.
-   _Shantae and the Seven Sirens_: Golems have one big yellow eye with tiny pupil and one rectangular eye socket much larger than the other small, yellow, pupilless eye.

    Webcomics 

-   Black Mage, from _8-Bit Theater_ does this a lot, and was stuck for a while after a particular bit of frustration. As he put it after listening to one of Red Mage's "plans", "That's so stupid I can't even see straight."
-   The titular amorph from _Schlock Mercenary_ has one eye that is literally larger than the other, and the cartoonist is consistent about which is which, and what side each is on. Since Schlock can move his eyes around it doesn't really matter though.
-   Several characters in _Girl Genius_ do this sometimes... and there's one, a construct, who really _does_ have one eye bigger than the other.
-   Bob from _Bob the Angry Flower_. When Bob's scorching feral mania comes to the fore, he gets the Mad Eye.
-   Vatsy, the insane journalist from _Vatsy and Bruno_, is always drawn with one eye in shadow to accentuate his wrong-ness.
-   Happens occasionally in _Narbonic_. Most notable when Mad!Dave "convinces" the Daves to hire him as their mad scientist liaison.
-   Kano of _Kagerou_ is frequently seen with pupils of very different sizes, though his actual _eyes_ are the same size. The effect is halfway between Mad Eye and heterochromia.
-   Nova from _Keychain of Creation_, especially when in Mad Scientist mode.
-   Used in _Commander Kitty_ to show intense pain, or to illustrate the sudden, terrifying feeling of being the Only Sane Man amongst a crazy crew that insists you get a costume change.
-   In this _El Goonish Shive_ sketchbook strip, Dan gets this while explaining his "master plan".
-   _Drowtales_: One cameo character, Cac'bolg<small>◊</small>, has eyes like these. This emphasizes the fact that he's a member of Vel'Vloz'ress, the most messed up and chaotic faction in all of Chel'el'Sussoloth. Also, he seems to have some kind of obsession with poisons.
-   _Sequential Art_: One of the denizens sports this expression after spending too long near Hillary's disembodied happiness. Too long being something like five minutes.

    Web Animation 

-   Jason from Element Animation's _The Crack_ has heterochromia, with one eye having a green iris. Also accentuated by his permanent case of red sclerae.
-   Bubs, from _Homestar Runner_, definitely looks like this, but is no crazier than the rest of the cast.
-   The eponymous character from _Spoilsbury Toast Boy_ has this permanently<small>◊</small>, as does his sister.
-   _Zero Punctuation_ will sometimes show these, usually of the Oh, Crap! variety, having a character with one eye as a ring and the other as a circle.
-   Nutty from _Happy Tree Friends_ has this for _both_ his eyes, each in a different variety: one with a constantly contracted pupil and one lazy green eye, the latter as a result of his sugar addiction. Interestingly, when he is cured in one episode, the differing colour remains while the lazy eye disappears, suggesting that part to be natural heterochromia rather than madness-related.

    Web Original 

-   This guy: o\_O

    Western Animation 

-   Bumi from _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ is a Crazy is Cool Old Master with exceptionally refined earthbending powers, surprising wisdom, and an asymmetrical stare.
-   Many characters from _Invader Zim_, including the titular invader on occasion.
-   The anger-prone Mr. Demartino from _Daria_, to the point where it looks like he's always on the verge of having a stroke.
-   Shado the Brain Thief from _Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law_. His mad eye alternates from right to left.
-   Uncle Ruckus in _The Boondocks_ is a delusional Boomerang Bigot with a very fake-looking glass eye that accentuates the ludicrousness of the character and his racist rants.
-   _The Tick_ — the title character, who is never entirely straight.
-   Vince from _Rex the Runt_, one of the more random oddballs in claymation: given to random fits of Pavarotti and tangential one-word sentences.
-   The starring spider in the (still unfinished) Art Institute of Portland student production _Tangled Web_, sometimes. Then again, he's decided to become a vegetarian and is desperate to avoid the delicious, delicious fly that's just landed in his web, so can you really blame him?
-   VERY evident on _Ed, Edd n Eddy._ "Boy Double D. Eddy never stares at ME like that."
-   In _The Critic_, Duke Phillips once answered a reporter's question by telling him to "stare deep into the hypnotic powers of my EEEeeevil eeeye!" It apparently works.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   Discord has red eyes with two irises of different sizes to illustrate his chaotic nature.
    -   This look is sometimes briefly applied to characters as an unspoken Oh, Crap! moment.
    -   This happens to characters when they suffer Sanity Slippage, often combined with Twitchy Eye.
-   Two-Face gets this treatment as an effect of stylization in _Batman: The Animated Series_, as does Jonah Hex in the episode "Showdown." Characters that aren't completely human, such as Man-Bat and Clayface, sometimes do this.
-   Dr. Mystico on _Freakazoid!_, as if his introductory speech weren't enough of a giveaway.
-   Icarus from _Hercules_, with a permanent red eye (possibly bloodshot, given he flew too close to the sun).
-   Débora from the _Clanners_ shorts has a big left eye with a red iris as opposed to the right eye being smaller and black outlined white. In eating form, both eyes are colored like the right eye but the left eye is still bigger.
-   In the animated adaptation of _Donkey Kong Country_, whenever King K. Rool is particularly surprised, only one of his eyes bulges wide, as a nod to his game counterpart.

    Real Life 

-   Anisocoria, or asymmetric pupil dilation, can be a sign of serious neurological problems. This is also one of the first things EMTs and Paramedics check for when they suspect a concussion. Most carry penlights specifically to test this by shining it on the pupil and seeing if it reacts. That said, it can also merely be a byproduct of severe past injury to the eye, such as with David Bowie, who owed his distinctively mismatched eyes to being nearly blinded in a childhood fight<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   Sir Patrick Moore, who for nearly sixty years was the face of popular astronomy on BBC TV, had this appearance - permanently - after a lifetime of obsessively looking into the heavens through the eyepieces of optical telescopes. (While undeniably eccentric, Moore could not be called insane.)
-   John Ritter had a slightly distorted pupil in his right eye, which was a result of birth defect known as coloboma, a congenital malformation of the eye causing defects in the lens, iris, or retina.
-   Thom Yorke of Radiohead fame has a perpetually droopy left eyelid — he was born unable to open his left eye at birth due to paralysis, and one operation he had at a young age was botched, leading to its current state. Thom decided against further corrective surgery and actually decided to hold onto his look as a personal badge of pride: "At that point I decided I liked the fact that it wasn’t the same, and I’ve liked it ever since."
