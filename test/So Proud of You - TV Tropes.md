_"You are nearly there. Very close. We are... so proud of you."_

Our young hero has accomplished! Perhaps they have triumphed, perhaps they have decided to undertake a Heroic Sacrifice, perhaps they have proven worthy to respond to the Call.

How can this be fittingly celebrated? Why, have them be told how proud people are of them!

Normally this is said only by people who have reason to be proud: their parents, a Parental Substitute, their mentor, the Team Dad, A Father to His Men, etc. This is usually done for a young hero, whose skills might have been in doubt, and had unquestionably been formed by the person saying it. It may happen very early in the story, as proof that they are ready for the call, but is more common at the end to validate their Character Development.

May also be a form of encouragement after a character has progressed a certain amount but is feeling discouraged.

There is the form "I'm so proud of you." Or "We are so proud of you," if one can speak for more than one (such as a mother or father for both parents).

Then there is the form "Your father would have been so proud of you." Normally addressed to fatherless heroes, though any Disappeared Dad may qualify them. May be spoken by the mother, or by any other mentor. They may not want, even in this moment, to have a Not So Stoic moment, and so distance themselves from the praise. They may be aware that the child craves his father's approval, and would value this. They may also not want to claim too much credit, since saying "I am so proud of you," implies that they have a reason to be proud.

While "father" is the most common, "Your mother (or other figure) would be so proud of you," is also possible, in similar situations. "You should be proud of yourself" is another alternative, which ascribes even more of the credit to the person themselves.

This is, in fact, what the "Well Done, Son" Guy craves, but the hero has not usually been striving with their eye on it, and the speaker is willing to tell them, freely.

This trope can also be Played for Laughs when the child does something despicable or even outright criminal, and the parent approves of their deviant behavior. The Doting Parent does this all the time, and gushingly so, which means the one they are so proud of is likely terribly embarrassed. Alternatively, the trope Don't Tell Mama exists because a crook wants to hear this and doesn't want their parents to be disappointed in them for taking up a life of crime.

One variation takes up the form of The Ghost. The one who is proud of the other has died prior to the protagonist's great accomplishment. The happy ending may include a scene with the spirit of the deceased party looking down and smiling proudly. Sometimes the protagonist gets to see them. Sometimes only the audience does.

Contrast It Has Been an Honor, where the character is usually addressing someone he has not formed, though he may have led him. Also contrast Disappointed in You.

See Your Approval Fills Me with Shame for when they don't want this praise.

Also see Like a Son to Me.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the anime version of _Atelier Escha & Logy: Alchemists of the Dusk Sky_, Lucille, a wealthy heiress who dreams of making medicine and curing all disease gets this from her father after the vaccine she submits to Central is chosen as the best of the submissions.
-   _Bleach_: During the second Vandenreich invasion, Byakuya comes to Rukia's aid after her opponent releases his true form. He directly acknowledges how far she's come and how strong she now is. She's so overwhelmed by Byakuya's acknowledgement, that her confidence is instantly restored, allowing her to thrash her opponent.
-   By the end of _Code Geass_ Lelouch says this to Nunnally, though while she's under Geass as he's pulling a Thanatos Gambit that requires him to be the most hated person in the world, acknowledging how far she's come and how she isn't helpless needing her big brother all the time to protect her. It's more poignant considering he briefly breaks his Evil Overlord character and takes the time to say this to her despite the fighting going on outside; and his Knight Templar Big Brother status makes it very meaningful as he now can fully trust her to be okay without him.
-   Subverted in _Death Note_, as Soichiro Yagami finally confirms on his deathbed that his son Light isn't the mass-murderer Kira. He is.
    -   Played straight when _Ryuk_ says this to Light at his graduation ceremony...
-   In _Dragon Ball Z,_ right before Vegeta sacrifices himself in a (failed) attempt to kill Majin Buu, Vegeta embraces his son, Trunks, and says "I want you to know that... you have made me proud."

-   In the final episode of _The Galaxy Railways_, The Hero Manabu gets to hear this from his father in a sort of vision thing.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_ has Truth praising Edward when he finally realizes the lesson no other alchemist has before: Their friends and family are more valuable than alchemy.
    
    **Truth**: _\[grinning with delight\]_ You've done it! That's the right answer! Good job! You beat me! Go ahead! Take him home! The back door's right over there! Goodbye, Edward Elric!
    
-   _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_. In "Solid State Society" Aramaki goes to visit a mentor in hospital. It's not a dignified sight — his mentor is dying alone and in pain, rambling incoherently, with only his SexBots to tend him. When Aramaki goes to leave however, the mentor appears to mistake Aramaki for his son and says, "I'm glad an old fool like me sired a genius like you."
-   In _Gintama_, Okita's older sister and foster mother Mitsuba says how proud of him she is in her last moments. What results are the only tears Okita sheds during the entire series.
-   In _Girls und Panzer_, Hana's mother, after a period of estrangement from her daughter over her doing tankery, comes to a flower exhibit that Hana put on, concedes that doing tankery enabled her to bring a new sense of personality to her flowers, and admits that while her methods are different, they are good on their own merits. At the end of the tournament, Maho tells Miho that her way of fighting is different from the Nishizumi style and that she's glad she has found her own way of tankery. Even Miho's mother is shown at one point sighing, before smiling and applauding for Miho's victory.
-   In _High School D×D_, after Sairaorg's mom finally wakes up from a long coma, she sees her son and tells her she's proud of him. It causes him to shed a Single Tear.
-   Kikyo from _Hunter × Hunter_ is a rather twisted example of this trope. Being part of a Big, Screwed-Up Family of Professional Killers, she regularly praises her son Killua for doing ruthless things like assaulting her or taking her hostage.
-   An interesting double subversion happens in _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_: Kenichi's masters first chastise Kenichi for risking his life on a mission and put him on a house arrest. But later Kenichi's Cool Big Sis mentor Shigure secretly sets him an eavesdropping device through which he hears that his masters are actually celebrating his courage.
-   _Little Busters!_:
    -   In the visual novel, Kyousuke thinks that he's proud of Riki at several points, but the anime introduces a scene where he explicitly says this to him, after the accident when Riki and Rin are in the process of saving everybody:
        
        _I never imagined you'd be able to do all that. You've grown far stronger than even I'd hoped. I'm glad. I'm proud of you, Riki. You have finally… surpassed me._
        
    -   It's also present in the drama CD, made before the anime, in which the climax involves Kyousuke and Riki standing on the beach in the water, Riki crying because he's so happy to see Kyousuke back, and Kyousuke telling him he's proud of all he's done and how he's taken care of the Little Busters in his absence.
-   _Lyrical Nanoha_:
    -   Chapter 36 of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid_ has Nanoha saying the following to her unconscious daughter after she had just watched her give her all in her match against Miura.
        
        **Nanoha**: You were splendid, Vivio.
        
    -   This also implied in _StrikerS_ when Nanoha is brought to tears upon seeing Vivio standing up on her own after Nanoha had to hit her with _five_ Starlight Breakers to free her from the control of the Saint's Cradle. Although, it's possible that it was simply out of the sheer relief of being reunited with her daughter.
-   In _Medaka Box_, Medaka briefly dies, and her consciousness briefly awakens in a room where Anshin'in had meant to meet her at one time. There she finds the lost spirit of her mother, Hato Tsurubami. Tsurubami tells her that she doesn't need to fight any more. Medaka, however, refuses to accept that, even after her mother asserts to her about the way the world is. Although she doesn't deny her logic, Medaka states that she'd rather question the way the world is rather than just accept the way it is, especially because of how much she loves people. After she leaves, Tsurubami reflects on her own inability to continue fighting, and that there's only one thing that hasn't ever changed about her: how happy she was to have given birth to Medaka.
-   _Gundam_:
    
    -   Toward the end of _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_, Dr. Kasshu, Domon's father, is released from his cryonic state and acts as his son's adviser when it comes time to deal with the Dark Gundam once and for all. But before Domon heads off, he adds this: "You've grown up. You've really grown up, Domon."
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_ has a heart-wrenchingly powerful moment in Phase 40 (Phase 38 in the Remastered Version as Uzumi Nara Athha is preparing to sacrifice himself to allow the newly-created Three Ships Alliance to escape, as he presents his adopted daughter, Cagalli Yula Athha, with a picture revealing that she is Kira's twin sister. Despite the revelation that Cagalli and Uzumi are not related, he nevertheless acknowledges her as his own child as he sends her off, much to her horror as she knows she's about to lose him for good.
    
    **Uzumi Nara Athha:** I feel _very_ fortunate to have been your father.
    
-   Played for Laughs in _Monkey High!_ — when Macharu's dad sees that his son, who very strongly resembles a monkey, manages to get a beautiful girlfriend, he lets loose a large stream of Manly Tears and says this trope to Macharu.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   There's a moment somewhat like this when Naruto's father, the Fourth Hokage, is shown telling Naruto that he believes in him, that Konoha can be rebuilt, and he's counting on him.
    -   Iruka Umino invokes this trope numerous times throughout the series, constantly praising and encouraging Naruto when everyone else ignored or mistreated him. During Naruto's battle with Pain, Iruka can be seen smiling with immense pride at everything Naruto has accomplished.
    -   It's even better when Naruto returns from a deadly battle with Pain and the ENTIRE VILLAGE — the vast majority of whom have hated him his entire life for something he didn't do — cheers his return. He also earns a hug from his crush, who previously considered him an annoying friend. That particular moment is lessened because Naruto did not hug her back, which, in retrospect, foreshadowed what was to come nineteen chapters later.
    -   It is revealed that before his death, Fugaku said that he was proud of Itachi, no matter what. This same sentiment is carried over when Itachi declares, no matter what Sasuke does, he will always love his younger brother.
    -   Kakashi told his father he was proud of him, which also counts as Forgiveness.
    -   This is Kakashi's reaction when, during Team 7's final mission/battle together in the manga, Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke successfully pull off Kakashi's plan to defeat Kaguya, using absolutely flawless teamwork.
        
        _That was picture-perfect. Right now, the way you all are together...**I love you.**_
        
-   Hakase has this reaction in Chapter 75 of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ when Chachamaru attacks her due to a breach in privacy.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_:
    -   After Shinji's first battle, Misato tells him that he did a noble thing and he should be proud, but he doesn't take it to heart due to the pain it caused him.
    -   Later in the series, after another battle, his father Gendo tells him by speakerphone that he did a good job. He actually really takes it to heart and feels good about it, given that his father is usually a cold-hearted jerkass towards him.
    -   In the last episode Shinji decides that he wants to be himself and to "stay here," the theatre scene disappears, and all the other characters congratulate him including Gendou and Yui.
-   _One Piece_ has a non-parent variation: following the Whole Cake Island arc, several of Luffy's friends from around the world are shown reacting with elation and praise towards Luffy's latest achievements and new bounty, with Vivi, Koby, Rebecca, Shanks, and Sabo among them.
-   Both of Luluco's parents do this on separate occasions in _Space Patrol Luluco_. Keiji bursts into tears over the fact that she's managed to grow up fairly normally despite their family situation in the first episode, and Lalaco says that she's grown into a fine woman upon seeing her resolve to confess to Nova in episode 12. The moment with Lalaco is even more powerful since her eternally smug grin is replaced with a gentle smile of motherly affection.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: "You became a taller man than I was." Such are the words of Kamina's ghost to Simon.
-   The _Trigun_ manga has a version of this for Wolfwood. But instead of a parent figure saying it, the children of the orphanage throw confetti out of their escape ship to tell him "welcome home." They've realized that the brutal, cynical, hardass man who just killed himself to save them is not only one of them but is actually their beloved "big brother" who left them just a few years prior. He's maybe in his late teens and only looks (and fights) like a full-grown man because of artificial enhancements.
-   Toward the end of _Wandaba Style_, Teen Genius Susumu's father tells his wife that she should say this to their son, since he surpassed them both. We don't find out whether she does or not, though.

    Comic Books 

-   _All Fall Down_: This is played for laughs when IQ visits IQ Squared in prison.
-   _Astro City_: Many characters have this; even the retired villain Quarrel readily admits that he's proud of his daughter's heroic career.
    -   In "The Menace From Earth", Zo's mother ie ecstatic after seeing his high aptitude scores, as they indicate he's an extremely talented Zirr and may get to choose his own role in Zirr society.
-   _Batman_:
    -   _Batgirl_: In _Batgirl (2000)_, Alfred gives Cassandra Cain this speech on Batman's behalf.
        
        **Alfred:** You have achieved more in your few short years as Batgirl than many costumed heroes manage in a lifetime. You have saved countless lives, brought justice to the wicked and helped this city regain hope during the most difficult time in its history. I know for a fact that Master Bruce is immeasurably proud of you...and grateful for all that you've done.
        
    -   _Batwoman_: When Kate Kane comes home to her father and explains that she's been separated from the army, he naturally wants to know why.
        
        "Article 125, that's homosexual conduct."  
        "Yes, sir."  
        "Why couldn't you tell him what he needed to hear?"  
        "I'd have been lying."  
        "Then you kept your honor and your integrity. I'm proud of you. Your mother would have been, too."
        
    -   _Identity Crisis_: Jack Drake tells Tim he's proud of him as Tim heads out as Robin for the night. Shortly later that same night Jack's final words are:
        
        _I love you Tim, just like your mother loved you. What you do for all those people, it's worth it Tim. Never question it. It's worth it._
        
    -   _Red Hood and the Outlaws_: Jason Todd is insanely surprised when Superman tells him that Batman vouches for him and the Outlaws. This touched briefly in #17, and in #18 the reader finally gets to see Bruce, both in Jason's memories and in the present, admit how proud he is of him.
-   _Flashpoint_: Thanks to some time-travel shenanigans, The Flash delivers a message to Bruce from an alt-universe Thomas Wayne, which brings tears to the man's face.
-   _The Mighty Thor_: Odin is generally a terminal case of Cannot Spit It Out, but he did get to this point towards the God(dess) of Stories incarnation of Loki in issue #16 of _Loki: Agent of Asgard_, going so far as saying that Loki is a worthier son than Thor (they were on kind of bad terms those days)... and then Loki _rejected him_. The end must be nigh or something. Oh. Wait.
    -   This is a running theme in Thor's relationship with Odin in modern times, especially since JMS' run in the mid 2000s, to the point where in Aaron's run, present Thor was resigned to a bad relationship with his father, and old King Thor bluntly told young Thor (the Thor of about 1000 AD) that he'd never get what he wanted most — not Mjolnir, but Odin telling him that he was proud of him. Then at the very end of that run, at the end of _War of the Realms_, Odin grabs all three Thors (who'd time-travelled to abuse a loophole to get at Malekith) in a massive hug and tells them he's proud of them. Their utterly baffled expressions are both hilarious and depressing.
-   _Preacher_:
    -   A _stunningly_ dark subversion in Garth Ennis's series. Jesse Custer breaks the back of the man who shot his father in front of his eyes, then later killed his mother (or so he thought) and generally acted like a world-class sociopath... all the while teaching Jesse to ride, shoot, fight and fix engines. What are Jody's last words to him? "Prouda' you, boy..." Custer reacts by snarling out "DIE!" and strangling whatever life is left in him.
    -   Also, near the end, when Jesse is getting ready for his final fight, the Cowboy, who has appeared several times to him over the course of the comic to inspire him, appears and tells him this.
        
        **Jesse:** Hey. I want to thank you.  
        **Cowboy:** Thank me fer what...?  
        **Jesse:** For bein' a goddamn hero.  
        **Cowboy:** Hell, pilgrim, I'm just a... broke-down, wore-out ol' cowboy. But this broke-down, wore-out cowboy wanted ya to know, He's prouda ya.
        
-   _Secret Warriors_: During _Dark Reign_, Phobos used his powers to briefly cause Norman Osborn to have a breakdown by telling him that even though he thinks he's in control of his Green Goblin persona, he's not & he _will_ fail. His father Ares (Who it should be noted was aligned with Osborn at the time) is stood off to the side watching, with a proud look on his face that all but says "That's my boy".

-   _Superman_:
    -   In _Superman: Secret Origin_, Jimmy laments to Superman of his "Well Done, Son" Guy status with his family, and how they didn't expect much of him when he left for Metropolis. This causes Superman to remember when he left Smallville and the exchange he had with his parents.
        
        **Clark Kent:** I'll make you proud.  
        **Jonathan Kent:** You already do.
        
    -   In _The Unknown Supergirl_, Linda Danvers reveals her foster parents that she is Superman's cousin. Her mother says she is proud of her.

    -   In _Supergirl (Rebirth)_, _Supergirl_ has a flashback in which her father Zor-El said he was proud of her compassion and hopefulness during a school excursion:
        
        **Zor-El:** The Kamnium in the lake petrified these animals ages ago. They're not going anywhere.  
        **Kara:** Exactly. They're stuck here. But If I holo-photo them all, then a little piece of them can escape with me. It's pretty strange, I know. Everyone else thought so.  
        **Zor-El:** That's because no one else would ever see it that way, Kara. I would never say that's strange. That's Hope. That's what the crest we wear stands for. That's why I'm proud you're my daughter.
        
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _DC Comics Bombshells_: Hippolyta's bodyguards, Episteme and Techne, initially fight Diana when she comes to steal the royal armour and bracelets, but they reveal that they approve of her actions and will lead the Amazons to her side when she calls for them.

    Fan Works

    -   Has Thor (formerly James Potter — the first attempt at the whole 'humility' experiment had mixed results) express this to Harry on several occasions.
    -   In the sequel, Doctor Strange expresses this twice to his former student Wanda Maximoff, also formerly his ward. In the former case, he states that his choosing her to succeed him is not what makes her the best person to take his place; on the contrary, he chose her _because_ she was the best person to succeed him. Since the two have had an often difficult relationship, owing to Strange's deeply manipulative nature and skills as a master Truth Twister (he never lies, but is rarely honest), it's actually rather sweet.
-   _Seraphina's Tea Quest_: Captain Shalala personally visits the Health Clinic to tell Sora how proud she is of her for defeating the Ranborg threatening to destroy the clinic, even if it resulted in her catching Purple Spot Pox.

The DCU

_Dragon Age_

-   _Beyond Heroes: Of Sunshine and Red Lyrium_: He doesn't say it out loud (and it's implied that he doesn't really need to), but Varric has a moment of this kind of thinking in this _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ AU. After the defeat of the Big Bad, he watches the Inquisitor — Bethany Hawke — receiving the thanks of her advisory council and thinks that he's never been prouder of anyone in his life. Dorian interrupts by teasing him about the "ridiculously dewy-eyed expression" he's wearing.

_Dragon Ball_

-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_:
    -   In episode 51, Future Trunks finally stands up to Vegeta after enduring several episodes' worth of abuse from his (alternate timeline) father and blasts Vegeta over the horizon.

        **Vegeta:** Huh, this is a new feeling: pride in someone else...

    -   The late Serizawa's son Ren (who, by the way, is _not_ a mass-murdering Evil Genius obsessed with killing Godzilla like he was in _Godzilla vs. Kong_) receives the "Your father would have been so proud of you" form from Mark Russell, in Chapter 17, and he's visibly touched to hear it.

_Neon Genesis Evangelion_

-   _Advice and Trust_: Subverted. Shinji sought his father’s approval and praise for a long while, and when Gendo congratulated him for his part in defeating Sahaquiel, he felt happy… but after hearing how his father had treated Rei, he decides he was a fool for desiring his approval and being happy of having it earned that time.
-   _Ghosts of Evangelion_: Asuka says she is proud of Ryuko when her daughter stands up to her:
    
    **Asuka:** You little brat. Not even your father talks to me that way.  
    **Ryuko:** Tch. He calls you out on your bullshit all the time. Misato does, too. I'm not an idiot, mom; I see what's going on around me. How the hell would I have the nerve to speak up otherwise?  
    **Asuka:** (laughing and hugging her) You stupid little brat! I'm glad to see you take after your father in ways other than musical talent!  
    **Ryuko:** Cut it out, mom! Jeez, you're embarrassing me!  
    **Asuka:** I'm proud of you, little girl. I truly am.
    
-   _HERZ_: In chapter 10 Gendo manages to show he is proud of his son:
    
    _Gendou looked like he was going to say more. Instead he smiled, a genuine smile that spoke of love and how proud he was of the fine young man his son had grown up to be._
    
-   _Higher Learning_: In the last chapter, Yui and later Gendo tell Shinji that they are proud of him.
-   In _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide_:
    -   After Shinji makes amends with Asuka, Misato tells that she's proud of him:
        
        He felt her move, heard the rustle of skin and cloth as she rose from the chair. Then he felt her hand on his knee. "You were there for her, and that's hard enough," she said, so quietly it was barely a whisper. Yet the depth of her caring was obvious and welcome.  
        When he failed to react to her touch, she added, "It's been a bad day for everyone. Don't feel like you have to worry about homework tonight. You've earned a little break. I'm proud of you."  
        Shinji could not tell her how much those words meant to him, nor refuse to accept the weight they placed on his shoulders.
        
    -   Unexpectedly, Shinji gets praise from his father after telling he doesn't want to forget his mother, not matter how much it hurts:
        
        "I … I don't believe that," Shinji brought up his head. "I won't forget about mother. I miss her, and it hurts, but I won't forget."  
        Gendo's hard, dark eyes met him, his features carved out of stone, completely devoid of any emotion, good or bad.  
        Shinji stood his ground, even though he knew he sounded like a little boy who missed his mother. For better or worse, that was exactly what he was. Gendo could admonish him for it, but it was the truth, and he would rather live missing his mother than forget her because it hurt too much. His father had forgotten; to Shinji that was yet another sin.  
        To his surprise, Gendo nodded. "Then you are a stronger man than I."
        
-   _The One I Love Is..._: After the Final Battle, Fuyutsuki tells Shinji that his mother would be proud of him for what he had done.

    **Gendo**:_"That boy, he is uncorrectable."_  
    **Ritsuko**:_"Is that pride I hear in your voice, Advisor?"_  
    **Gendo**:_"The boy successfully shattered SEELE's plan for the next step of evolution and gave a big "Fuck You" to Keel Lorenz himself, completely burned my scenario along with any hope of reuniting with his mother, and bit me in half. Literally. Then, he proceeded to refuse the godhood I devoted my life to and the endless ecstasy of Instrumentality so he could return to the deserted wasteland we once called home, only to be beaten half to death by the deranged banshee he fell for… saving mankind in the process. What's there not to be proud of?"_
    
-   _The Second Try_:
    -   During her Mind Rape, Asuka sees a vision of Aki, and they have a mother-daughter moment. Right after saying goodbye to her, someone touches her shoulder, and Asuka turns around and sees her mother Kyoko smiling down to her, and nodding approvingly.
    -   When Yui is saying her final goodbye to Shinji, the narration states that she's proud of her son.
    -   Gendo's final thought toward Shinji having achieved happiness, upon which the story ends.
        
        But Gendo couldn't follow the discussion much longer. The low chatter faded out and the veil before his eyes seemed to grow again, leaving the picture of this family lingering in his mind as the last one before sleep slowly consumed him again.  
        A family...  
        Unnoticeable to him, he smiled at that thought. That was what he had always wanted. He had almost forgotten it over the path he had taken in these past ten years, but... they had been like that once too. Only with Yui gone, there had been a critical part missing that he couldn't see replaced by anyone else but her. Without her, they couldn't have possibly been happy.  
        Now Shinji had all he had ever wanted for himself. A life with people who loved him without question. People he could be happy with.  
        Gendo felt envy toward his son for that. But most of all, he –- for once -– was as proud of him as a father could possibly be.

When he makes contact with Tommy and Kimberly as the representatives of Earth's current Rangers, Zordon affirms that Tommy has always been one of the best Rangers he has ever known, and adds that he is glad to see Kimberly returned to both the duty of a Ranger and Tommy as well. As an extension of his respect for Tommy, Zordon affirms his belief that the Dino Thunder team will prove worthy of the power they must gain to defeat Xondar's forces simply because Tommy has chosen then, and when Xondar finally expresses regret, Zordon proclaims Tommy as "the truest example of redemption", assuring his grieving brother that Tommy is a worthy example to follow.

    **Gouken:** "You certainly were… I spent endless days wondering what horrors awaited Shinji in his next training session, how you would blow up next. But…" (smiling) "I worry no longer. You've grown into a stronger, more balanced person."  
    **Asuka:** "I guess so… But I couldn't have done it if you hadn't put up with me."

-   _Once More with Feeling_:
    -   Subverted. Shinji was overjoyed when his father praised him after stopping Sahaquiel... but after a while he decided that he had clung to his father's praise in a pathetic way.
        
        Once in his life, he would have leapt at the offer from his Grandfather, in the same pathetic way he had clung to his Father's praise after he had stopped the 10th Angel, letting those three worlds play over and over in his head.  
        \-("Good work, Shinji...")—
        
    -   Played straight when Misato praised Asuka after the latter fought Sandalphon.
        
        So don't give a damn about those armchair Generals second guessing you either Asuka. You're a hell of a pilot — today was the toughest battle we've ever been in and you handled yourself incredibly well. Regardless of our motives going into this, you rose to the challenge today. I'm proud of you — and Rei of course.

Jumba then tells Stitch how he hoped to create a genetic experiment that would surpass all the others as his masterpiece of evil, and to Jumba's initial disappointment, all of that changed when Stitch found his one true place and a family, and Jumba tells Stitch, "You are my greatest success, and I am very proud of you."

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Adventures Of Sinbad_: Probably counts as an inversion, Rumina being the series's Vain Sorceress and arguably main recurring villain that Sinbad has to deal with.
    
    **Sinbad:** Rumina would be proud.
    
-   From _Batman Begins_:
    
    **Rachel Dawes**: Your father would be very proud of you. And so am I.
    
    -   This is a callback after an earlier What the Hell, Hero? moment when she says he would be ashamed of him.
-   Occurs at the end of _Big Fat Liar_ at the conclusion of Jason's big plan.

    **Jason:** I wanted to gain your trust back, Dad.  
    **Mr. Shepard:** You've earned it.
    
-   _Black Widow (2021)_. Played for Black Comedy when Alexi (the former Soviet supersoldier Red Guardian) expresses his pride to his "daughters" for growing up to become such excellent killers.

-   Parodied in _Freddy Got Fingered_, where Gord and his father get on this subject and spend the better part of several minutes just saying "Proud!" to each other.

-   A particularly lovely moment in _The Goonies_ comes when Data's dad, an inventor like his son, tries to take a picture with a spring-loaded camera though it fails. Data tells his father that it's all right, since he cannot hug a photo. His dad responds with "You are my greatest invention."

-   In _Iron Man 2_, it comes in a slightly different form. It's more accurately _confidence_ that the hero will eventually make him proud, but it's really the same thing. Tony Stark recalls that his father was "cold and calculating," and that he "never told me he loved me, \[and\] never told me he liked me"). Thus, when Nick Fury tells him that his dad always believed he would carry on his legacy and take the arc reactor to the next level, Tony scoffs at the notion. Later, while going through his old man's stuff, he stumbles upon a recording his father left that was meant only for him. In it, he reveals that all of his life's work had always been for Tony. He also states that he is confident his son would change the future where he could not, and leaves him with this final message,
    
    **Howard Stark**: What is, and always will be, my greatest creation... is you.

-   Papa Smurf shows this to Clumsy near the end of _The Smurfs._

    -   Episode III — _Revenge of the Sith_:
        
        **Obi-Wan**: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be.
        
        -   Which makes what happens later in the film bitterly tragic.
    -   Episode VI — _Return of the Jedi_: Not verbally expressed — but Darth Vader tells Luke "You were right about me" and dies with the smile of a proud father on his lips.

Despite being blown away across the field, Antiope smirks in approval of having made her niece such a great warrior.
-   Sebastian Shaw towards Erik in the climax of _X-Men: First Class_, whom he congratulates for finally becoming a superpowerful mutant. It's pretty goddamn creepy, considering Shaw is an ex-Nazi Mad Scientist who destroyed most of Erik's life to motivate him to become what Shaw always dreamed Erik would be.

-   In what became a Tear Jerker for some in hindsight, the final image of Chris Candido on live television was of him letting The Naturals know this after they beat America's Most Wanted for the NWA World Tag Team Titles on a TNA show.
-   SMASH owner Yoshihiro Tajiri made the public announcement in February 2011 that he was very proud of his student KUSHIDA before acknowledging that he would be leaving the roster to wrestle full time for New Japan Pro-Wrestling in April.

-   Ric Flair's happy teared congratulations to Charlotte when she wins her first title in wrestling, proclaiming she'll be the greatest of the Flairs.
-   Treacherous Advisor Konnan may not have had Prince Puma's best interest at heart, but he couldn't help but show pride and congratulations when he outlasted Mil Muertes and Johnny Mundo, among many others, to become the first Lucha Underground Champion.
-   An odd case was Velez herself saying this to the older, more established wrestler Mercedes Martinez, which was basically Velez's way of excusing Martinez repeatedly putting her individual career before their Tag Team and Power Stable.

    Religion 

-   _The Bible_:
    -   In the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, when Jesus was baptized in the Jordan, the heavens opened, the Spirit came upon Him like a dove, and a Voice from Heaven said, "This is My beloved Son, with Whom I am well pleased." And also, "You are My beloved Son; with You I am well pleased."
    -   In the gospel of Matthew, in the Parable of the Talents, when two of the three servants who were given talents by their master came back and reported that they made double of what they were given, their master said, "Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful in a few things, you shall be ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord." This is contrasted with the third servant who was given only one talent, but didn't do anything with it except bury it and then return it to his master, to whom his master says, "You wicked and slothful servant, why didn't you leave it with the bankers so that I could have received back my own with interest?"
    -   The final judgement is this for those in humanity who believed in Jesus.

    Roleplay 

-   Played for Laughs in _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_. Mirielle, a student with a perfect record, needs to get everyone out of the school without alerting them to the presence of bombs. She does so by jamming up a microwave, starting a small fire, and lying to the principal about it when the fire alarm goes off. Her best friend Zia, who overhears this with her telepathy, is so proud of the bad influence she's had on her buddy.

    Toys

    Video Games 

-   In _Assassin's Creed III_, Haytham Kenway's last words to Connor has him saying that he's proud of him to an extent and that Connor has shown courage, strength and conviction. He caps it off by saying that he should have killed him long ago, which is sort of his way of considering him a Worthy Opponent.
-   In _Atelier Meruru: The Apprentice of Arland_, Meruru gets this from her father, Dessier, if she achieves her goals.
-   The first _Baldur's Gate_ game does this really well; if Khalid is in your party, and your character is Good, then he will compliment you, saying, "Gorion would be so proud of you" (Gorion is your foster father). Since this usually only occurs when you do some significant Good act, it does make your character feel like a hero.
-   In the Season of Infamy mission "Shadow War" in _Batman: Arkham Knight_, if the player chooses to destroy the cure instead of giving it to Ra's al Ghul, Ra's tells Batman how proud he is for letting him die (Ra's won't actually die in-game, but his daughter Nyssa indicates he has at most days to live).
-   _Borderlands 3_: Played for Laughs. When Clay discovers that one of his men faked his death, killed his team, and sold out the survivors to the maniacs ruining their planet, Clay is very impressed with how much he got for the deal ("Two planets and enough money to build a waterslide between them").
    
    **Clay:** I'm proud of you, man. You're living the dream. _\[chuckles\]_ Vault Hunter; kill this traitorous son of a bitch!
    
-   Mission Control in _Deep Rock Galactic_ is an easily annoyed Deadpan Snarker at his worst, but knows when to praise you for your professionalism and success. He's especially proud of you for coming so far when you earn a promotion.
-   _Die Hard: Vendetta_ sees the return of John McClane from the Die Hard films, and John's daughter Lucy a rookie cop like her dad. The Nakatomi Plaza level ends with a cutscene where Lucy kills the Big Bad and uttering her father's trademark "_Yipee-ki-yay, motherfucker!_", and John is quite proud of it.
    
    "That's _my_ girl!"
    
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   _Dragon Age: Origins_:
        -   If you are playing the Human Noble origin, you will eventually go through the gauntlet to retrieve Andraste's sacred ashes.

And Lastly in the Landsmeet where your people, including your father, have been kidnapped and are about to be sold into slavery. Rescuing him has him express that he's never been anymore proud of you and gives you a dagger that belonged to your late mother. And once again if you survive killing the Archdemon and he wishes your mother was alive to see you.
    -   _Dragon Age II_:
        
        -   There's a note in the Hawke Estate that reads "I'm very proud of you. Love, Mother." Easily missed, but hardly forgettable especially after your mother is killed by a crazy mage. Additionally, your sister Bethany or brother Carver will give you one if they manage to survive until the final battle.
        -   Leandra actually tells you this twice, once through written text, again as she dies in your arms.
        
        **Leandra:** I love you. You've always made me so proud.
        
        -   If Bethany is brought along in the _Legacy_ DLC, she acts as a proxy so the siblings' late father can give one. As she was his only mage child, he had to spend the extra time with her to minimize the risk of Power Incontinence and Demonic Possession, but he was no less proud of Hawke and Carver, or "his little soldiers/his scoundrel and his soldier" as he called them.
-   _Dragon Ball Fighter Z_:
    
    -   If Goku or Piccolo win a match while on a team with Ultimate Gohan, they may tell him this in their victory screen. Goku's line had a passive-aggressive "finally" attached in the demo, but this was removed from the finished product after fans pointed out how jarring and out-of-character it was.
    
    **Goku:** Gohan! You've gotten a whole lot stronger. That makes me proud.  
    **Piccolo:** I'm proud of your growth, Gohan. That was an admirable performance.
    
    -   Goku also has a more to-the-point version with SSJ2 Gohan.
    
    "Gohan, I'm proud of you."
    
-   Cranky Kong in _Donkey Kong Country_ is generally a cranky old ape who belittles the heroes for not being as good as he was when it comes to beating the game quickly or finding all the secrets. In the second game, he mellows out a bit but is still judgmental of Diddy's performance at the end of the game, which is based on how many Hero Coins you found. If you do manage to find all of said coins, Cranky admits that he was wrong and is proud of Diddy for proving himself as a hero.
    
    **Cranky Kong**: I'm not afraid to admit it, Diddy m'boy. Even I'm wrong occasionally. You're as a big of a hero as they come. You must take after me and Donkey. Well done!
    
-   Guan Yu in the _Dynasty Warriors_ games. His children are warriors in the service of Shu just like him, and he makes it a point to show them how proud he is of them, calling them the future of Shu.
-   In the end of _Eternal Darkness,_ the ghost of Alex's grandfather appears to tell her how proud of her he is, for holding her own against Pious and the forces of the ancients themselves. He also offers her one last bit of help, sealing away the summoned ancient for her—while all the others who were killed in possession of the Tome of Eternal Darkness got to strike a blow to the artifact of the ancient, actually stopping the summoned beast is his contribution.
-   In _Fallout 3_ , The PC's father basically gives you one of these at the Jefferson Memorial, if you've been playing the good side of the Karma Meter.

    -   _Dissidia Final Fantasy_ gives us Tidus' storyline, where after Tidus defeats his father in battle Jecht tells him "You've grown up strong." Coming from Jecht, well, those who played Final Fantasy X may well be moved to sniffles.
        -   Alternatively, _Final Fantasy X_ has Tidus tell Jecht that he's proud of him during Jecht's final moments.
    -   In _Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates_, Latov says that he's proud of how strong and good Yuri and Chelinka have grown just before he moves on to the true afterlife.

-   Titania says this to Ike in _Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance_. In the Best Ending of _Radiant Dawn_, too, Almedha is proud of Soren for "having lived and grown strong."
-   _Jak and Daxter_:
    -   In _Jak II: Renegade_, Jak leaves the group in a huff after an argument with Keira right before the critical Class Two race, leaving Daxter to take his place. After Daxter wins the championship, Jak comes back and tells Daxter that he's proud of him. Daxter's gives an excited "Really?".
    -   Then there's Damas in _Jak 3_, who says that he's proud of Jak after the latter wins an arena match. He then swiftly tries to keep up his disguise of the tough guy warrior king by saying what he's really proud of is the training program. Which, coupled with all of the other fatherly moments in the game Damas and Jak have, makes the revelation that he was Jak's father hit home even harder.
-   At the end of _Half-Life 2: Episode Two_, as Alyx and Gordon prepare to leave in a helicopter to rescue Judith Mossman, her father Eli tells her, "I just… wish all this didn't have to fall on _you_, Alyx. Your mother would be so proud."

-   In _Knights of the Old Republic_ going out of your way to do a lightsided deed with Juhani in the party will get a similar response to Khalid: "This is how a Jedi acts, with honour." It's easy to forget being a Jedi is more than stabbing things with a lightsaber.
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_, King Dorephan says this to his son Prince Sidon after Divine Beast Vah Ruta is freed from Ganon's corruption. Sidon seems surprised by his father's praise, feeling that Link was the one who did the bulk of the work subduing the Vah Ruta. Urbosa also wants Link to convey how proud of Zelda she is.
-   _Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon_ has Trickster Mentor E. Gadd remark on Luigi's bravery before the final battle, after spending the entire game making jokes at the character's expense and hinting that Luigi wasn't his first choice.
-   In the _Mass Effect_ series:
    -   In _Mass Effect_, if you bring Liara to Noveria, as Matriarch Benezia is succumbing again to the indoctrination, the last thing she says as herself before attacking you again is "Liara, you always made me proud." Benezia is Liara's mother.
    -   In _Mass Effect 2_:
        -   Samara the Asari Justicar has a variation. During the process of fighting her Serial Killer daughter to the death, she heaps abuse on her, but after she is dead she tells Shepard how proud she is of her daughter's strength and cleverness.
        -   A Paragon Shepard invokes this trope just before the Final Battle, asking the surviving squadmates to make him/her proud in the final Rousing Speech.
    -   In _Mass Effect 3_:
        
        _"You did good, son/child._<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  _You did good. I'm proud of you."_
        
-   An extremely warped example occurs in _Octopath Traveler II_. During Hikari's story, Ritsu tells Mugen that General Rou turned traitor and helped Hikari, so Ritsu killed him and brought Rou's head to Mugen as proof. Mugen promotes Ritsu to general on the spot, commending him for his skill in the process. When Ageha asks if Mugen actually believes him, Mugen replies that he realizes Ritsu is lying (Hikari had already fought Rou, and Ritsu simply finished him off in an attempt to make the failed arms trade not a complete bust). However, Mugen is still pleased by this turn of events, since he _is_ impressed by Ritsu getting creative to turn the situation in his favor.

As Jack starts explaining the story he is reading and the view changes to John, the audio begins to fade and replaced by light piano notes, implying John lost his concentration in favor of admiring his son.
-   The ending theme of _R-Type Final_ is actually _called_ "Proud Of You", and includes the words as Gratuitous English lyrics. (Unfortunately, Fresh Games butchered the game's finale and replaced the song with Blue Man Group's "Piano Smasher," giving a more Downer Ending feel.)
-   After defeating the final boss of _Solatorobo_, Baion admits that he is proud of Red for standing up for his friends (and the world), even though he initially considered him a failure. His mother Merveille also says that she is quite proud of him as well, though she never considered him a the spectacular failure that his father did. Perhaps notably, they are only his biological parents and did not raise him, nor was he actively seeking their approval or even incredibly interested in where he came from.

    **Flynn**: I am so proud to call you my friend, Yuri Lowell.
    
    -   Before that, we have _the whole party_ doing this to Karol after he holds the line against a dangerous boss that had the rest fully trapped. Lovable Coward that he is, this is the final moment of Karol's development into a badass. And everyone is proud of him. So _very_ proud.

In the corner, a small smile creeps across the (apparently asleep) Oobleck's face.
    -   In "Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back", when Yang is training with her father Tai, he gives her a harsh wake-up call about her over-reliance on her Semblance and her simple fighting style. When they have one last spar before dinner, she fights him to a standstill, leading him to say "Now you're using your—". He doesn't get an opportunity to finish before she trips him and catches him before he falls. He looks up at her and gives the warmest smile yet seen on the show.
    -   Yang gets it again in "Lighting the Fire", this time from her Missing Mom. Raven congratulates Yang on making it to her hideout, citing her patience, determination, and strength in making the journey.

Syphile barely has time to call out Quain'tana on her lousy parenting skills before Quain'tana breaks her neck. Quain'tana remarks that Syphile finally displayed the inner strength needed to be Sarghress.
-   Subverted and discussed in _Dumbing of Age_: Leslie would _like_ to say she's proud of Becky for finding her own path, but her own issues about the phrase-namely that her parents _only_ said that if she did what they told her to do-make it hard for her to do so.

Then he drops a Secret Test of Character on her by offering her the chance to have a child, and she refuses, on the grounds that she can't offer the first of her species' second generation a stable home like it deserves.
        
        **Florence:** Was this a test?  
        **Bowman:** I needed to see if you would choose based on your needs or the needs of your species. The correct answer was to choose what was best for your species. Instead, you chose on what was best for the pup. There's a funny thing that happens when you know the correct answer. It throws you when you get a different answer that's not wrong.
        
-   _Girl Genius_:
    -   He doesn't say it directly to his son, but after Gilgamesh Wulfenbach defeated an entire army of war machines singlehandedly, his father Baron Klaus Wulfenbach, normally a "Well Done, Son" Guy while grooming his son to take his position some day, expresses perhaps the highest praise of Gilgamesh he is capable of to Dr. Sun, with a huge, beaming grin on his face.
        
        **Dr. Sun:** I do hope \[being forcibly dragged, while recovering from horrible injuries, from a hospital bed to a window and back again to see Gilgamesh's feat\] was worth it.  
        **Klaus:** _Anything_ — being paralyzed for _life_ — would be an acceptable price for seeing what I have seen my son do this day. Oh, _yes._
        
    -   Carson von Mekkhan gives one to his grandson Vanamonde, when he offers to be the first to test Agatha's Mad Science brewed coffee.

        **Vanamonde:** _\[aside\]_ Besides, if the regular coffee set her off, who knows what this will do.  
        **Carson:** I'm proud of you, m'boy.
        
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   John's Dad is constantly telling him this, probably in response to the self-abusive graffiti John wrote on his wall in his sleep.

One of Dad's favourite ways of spreading the encouragement is through leaving John little printed notes.

Later, this acquires a bitter connotation to Elan.
    -   Ian expresses pride in Haley's subtlety — while refusing to believe that Roy is really the leader.

    -   When Zuko returns to the Fire Nation his father tells him he's proud of him and why. It's a creepy scene, since Ozai is praising Zuko for _killing Aang._ It's also something Zuko didn't actually do.
    -   There's the finale, when Zuko is reunited with his uncle. It starts with Zuko outside the tent, paralyzed with shame at his betrayal of his uncle. He only goes in once Katara gives him assurance (a tearjerker in itself, given that Katara used to hate him). When he goes in, he finds uncle asleep, so Zuko kneels and waits the entire night for Iroh to wake up, all the while stewing in his own shame. When Iroh wakes, he turns away from Zuko as Zuko makes his apology, giving you the impression that he actually is ashamed of Zuko and angry at the betrayal. It's only when he turns around and fiercely embraces Zuko that you realize that Iroh was just trying to keep it together because he was filled with such joy and pride in his adopted son for finding his way back to the light.
    -   At the end of the series, Hakoda exclaims he's the "proudest father in the world".
    -   Not to mention Katara taking Aang aside to tell him how proud she is of his progress, just before the Black Sun invasion. That one got a little sidetracked, though.
    -   And in _The Legend of Korra_, Tenzin, after witnessing Korra restore Lin Beifong's bending to her in the season finale, tells her "I am so proud of you, _Avatar_ Korra". The final point that subverts the Bittersweet Ending the series was building up to. He does it again later, telling Korra that she's achieved more in the last five years than most Avatars do in an entire lifetime. He also expresses pride in the achievements of Jinora when she leads Korra into the spirit realm, and newly minted Airbender Bumi when he leads the trainees to defeat some poachers. Basically, when the universe isn't conspiring to make him lose his dignity, Tenzin is a full-time so-proud-of-you engine.
-   At the end of "King Badou vs. the Pirates" from _Babar and the Adventures of Badou_, after the situation with the pirates is resolved, Babar tells Badou "You're going to make a fine king one day, Badou. I am very, very proud of you."
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_:
    
    -   After Batman is exposed to Scarecrow's fear toxin, he starts seeing images of his father calling him "a disgrace".
    
    **Alfred Pennyworth:** That's rubbish. I know your father would be proud of you because... _I'm_ so proud of you.
    
-   _Big City Greens_: The phrase is said three times in "Homeshare Hoedown"; the first two by Bill to Cricket for learning how to cater to his homeshare tourists (when in reality it is irritating him) and letting him share the kids' room with them, and the third by Gloria after teaching Cricket and Tilly to be "cultured, urban sophisticates".
-   _Captain Planet and the Planeteers_: Gaia says this in regards to the Planeteers _at least_ three times.
    -   In "Volcano's Wrath", when the kids rush off to stop Sly Sludge, she says, "Children. They make a mother proud".
    -   At the end of "Fare Thee Whale", after they've exposed Plunder and Blight's scheme, she tells them, "I'm proud of all of you".
    -   In "Future Shock", after Ma-Ti takes the zap meant for a little girl, the future Eco-Villains are wiped out from existence and Zarm dematerializes, Gaia hugs the boy and declares, "I'm proud of you, Ma-Ti. You did the right thing today".
-   _Danny Phantom_: The Mansons said this to their daughter Sam (and her friends) after they foiled the Big Bad of the episode. Considering how Sam and her parents don't get along, it's a positive moment.
-   The _Defenders of the Earth_ episode "A Demon in His Pocket" (in which Kshin disobeys an order not to touch Mandrake's sorcery books, then has to confess when the demon he summons in a misguided attempt to "show" the school bullies runs amok in Central City) ends with the following exchange:
    
    **Kshin**: Mandrake, I'll take my punishment like a man. But please don't send me away!  
    **Mandrake**: Who said anything about sending you away?  
    **Kshin**: Shogoth showed me the future. How you would send me away if I told you about him and... and...  
    **Mandrake**: And you told me anyway. That took a lot of courage, Kshin.  
    **Kshin**: You're not gonna send me away?  
    **Mandrake**: No. This is your home, now and forever. You'll still be punished, but no-one's sending you anywhere, Kshin.  
    **Kshin** _(sobbing with relief):_ Oh, Mandrake, you can trust me! I'll never disobey you again! I'll make you so proud of me!  
    **Mandrake**: You already have, Kshin. You already have.
    
-   In the _DuckTales (1987)_ episode " Top Duck", Launchpad's family finally gets the chance to tell Launchpad how not-ashamed of him they are at the episode's end.
    
    **Ripcord**: Launchpad, will ya shut your beak and listen to me for just one minute? I'm so proud of ya, I'm about to explode. But you never give me the chance to say so.  
    **Launchpad**: R-r-really? You're not just saying that?  
    **Birdy**: Oh, we're all proud of you, Launchpad.  
    **Loopy**: Like, totally, to the max, for sure!
    
-   The Grand Finale of _DuckTales (2017)_ provides a rather dark example when Bradford pushes Black Heron into the Solego Vortex. Seeing as she had spent the past fifty years trying to get him to embrace his inner supervillain, all she does is smile and comment "Oh, Bradford, how _villainous_." before she's wiped from existance.
-   A darkly humorous one occurs in _Evil Con Carne_. When Major Dr. Ghastly creates a robot army for Hector, Hector entrusts Skarr to keep an eye on them. Skarr then has the robots reprogrammed to obey him by putting his name on the controls. Afterwards, Skarr has Ghastly create a robot in his image that he calls his son, Skarr Junior. And when Skarr entrusts Junior to watch over the robot army, Junior puts his name on the controls to take over the robot army. When Skarr realizes that his son has betrayed him, his last words before he’s killed are that he’s proud of his son.
-   _Futurama_ episode "The Route Of All Evil" sees Cubert and Dwight starting a newspaper delivery service that performs so well that they manage to usurp Professor Farnsworth and Hermes — their own father figures — out of Planet Express, partly out of revenge for how poorly they mistreated them in their endeavors. However, the stresses of keeping up with the ever-increasing demand catches up to them, and they tearfully ask their fathers for help, admitting that in the end, they just wanted to make them proud of their accomplishments, prompting this reaction:
    
    **Hermes**: _Proud of you?!_ You ruined us with sleazy business practices, and a complete disregard for human decency! _(beat)_ Of course we're proud of you!  
    **Farnsworth**: Damn right we are!
    
-   _Gargoyles_: Goliath to Angela at the end of "Mark of the Panther":
    
    "Your quick thinking helped us defeat Anansi. I am proud of you, my daughter."
    
    -   This is especially heartwarming as it marks the moment that he finally acknowledges her as his daughter. Note that the lack of acknowledgment wasn't because he ever disapproved of her personally, but because gargoyles traditionally didn't keep track of who laid which eggs.
-   _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)_: Prince Adam usually receives some variation of a Disappointed in You comment from someone once an episode, normally his faher, King Randor. Naturally, none of them are aware of Adam's secret identity as He-Man, the effort he puts into protecting Eternia, and how his carefree attitude is mostly just how he relaxes between world-ending crisises. Still, He-Man usually gets all the praise while Adam has to good naturedly take whatever criticisms come his way. This all changes in the 'Secret of the Sword' movie, where Prince Adam is able to return his sister Adora to Eternia after she'd been kidnapped to another world as an infant. Adora gives Adam and not He-Man full credit for going to another world and bringing his sister home. Randor, crying Tears of Joy from having his daughter returned, goes over to Adam and tells the Prince exactly what he thinks of him before giving Adam a big damn So Proud of You hug.
    
    **King Randor:** Son, I want you to know that today you've made me the happiest man in all of Eternia.

        **Batman**: They'd love it here, don't you think?  
        **Lord!Batman**: Who?  
        **Batman**: Mom and Dad. They'd be _so_ proud of you.  
        **Lord!Batman**: ...Just drive.

Princess Celestia makes it quite clear that she couldn't be prouder to have Twilight Sparkle as her personal student after Twilight deliberately disobeyed Celestia's stipulations for passing the test in order to ensure that King Sombra is defeated once and for all.
    -   Celestia to Twilight, _again_, in "Magical Mystery Cure". This time in **song**!
    
    "_You've come such a long, long way_  
    _And I've watched you since that very first day_  
    _To see how you might grow_  
    _To see what you might do_

-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Played with in "Brother's Little Helper", when Bart, whacked out on way too Focusyn, hijacks a tank and runs amuck around town.
        
        **Nelson:** You've raised the bar for all of us, Simpson; and I thank you. \*bows\*  
        **Bart:** Wow! Praise from Caesar!

    -   In "The PTA Disbands", Bart and Lisa realize that each has the other's packed lunch by comparing the notes that Marge had left in each. Lisa's reads, "We're so _very_ proud of you." Being _The Simpsons_, the treacle is cut by Bart's note, "Be good. For the love of God, _please_ be good."
    -   "Bart Gets an F" ends with the family having this reaction to Bart's barely-passing D-minus grade, giving it pride of place on the refrigerator where Lisa's A grades typically go.
