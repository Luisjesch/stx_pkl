_"Ugly Dog Theory: In a comedy, whenever someone is being pummeled with insults, it's always the last and most seemingly innocent insult that evokes a heated response. Example: 'You're ugly, your mother is ugly, your brother is ugly and your dog is ugly!' Response: 'You can't talk that way about my dog!'"_

Someone accused of Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking only takes serious offense to the claims of jaywalking.

After being given a Long List of their flaws and transgressions, a character responds by selecting one of the flaws and saying "I am not (flaw)!" as if to imply that all the other flaws were all spot-on. For maximum comedic effect, offense is taken to the mildest one in the list, or the offended has to ask the offender to repeat the one he's insulted by ("Hey, I am NOT a... um, what was that last one again?") which insinuates that all of them may be accurate. Frequently, they'll be entirely justified. Despite the name, the character doesn't always pick the _last_ one. If their Berserk Button comes up, it's going to offend them more than any other insult. It can be used sarcastically with Lovable Rogues, and a staple of the Deadpan Snarker. Sometimes refuting the most easily refuted charge can discredit the whole string for an in-story audience.

Alternatively, a character may take umbrage at _all_ the insults, but address the one that bothers them most rather than getting into a point-by-point argument or address one that isn't a matter of opinion. Sometimes, it's just that only one of the set of insults actually matters, to either the speaker or target or both.

This can also be used for character exposition. A villain may not care about being called a brute or a sadist, but be offended by being called a wimp.

In Real Life, it's done as an Insult Backfire, as they respond to the petty insult while ignoring the larger ones as if to say "It's not worth my time".

A variation on this is for the character to claim that the string of insults is a half-truth, letting the viewer try to decide which parts are true or not. It's occasionally inverted with a bullying character playing the Jerk With A Heart Of Jerk card and "apologizing" for an insult in a way that degrades the insultee(s) more. For example, calling an entire group of people "pigs" and then saying: "I'm sorry. I hope I didn't offend any pigs." Or calling someone "ugly" and, when an apology is demanded, saying: "Okay, I'm sorry you're ugly."

Compare My Friends... and Zoidberg, Insult Backfire, Non Sequitur Distraction, Wrong Insult Offence. This is a case of the character on the receiving end of Comically Missing the Point.

    Advertising 

-   A series of Coke Zero ads featured various animate body parts. One, in particular, had the French Jerk eyeball (who was earlier admiring his own beauty in a mirror) inform the pair of Cockney-accented tongues that they are actually drinking Coke Zero, not Coke like they think they are (because only the eyeball can actually see what is written on the bottle).
    
    **Tongue:** Y'know, we don't like you, Eyeball. You know why? Because you're a big. Fat. Liar.  
    **Eyeball:** _\[gasp\]_ I am _not **fat**_!

They object to the last one, on account of her not wearing one either.
-   In the first _Bakemonogatari_ novel, Araragi is impressed by Senjougahara's vocabulary. She tells him that it's not that she's good with words, but that he's "an illiterate bum."

It's when he muses that her daughter might be his child that he finally crosses the line. Athena clamps her hand over his mouth long enough to set the record straight about who Clara's real father is, then uses her legs to crush his spine.

    -   In one manga chapter, for reasons that make as much sense in context, Nozomu brings in his "second opinion" of his students, who are (mostly <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) gonk guys in wigs who imitate their mannerisms. When the one for Yaoi Fangirl Harumi shows up and announces a Slash pairing preference, Nami muses at how similar they are. Harumi, angrily indicates that she isn't like that- she prefers a different "top", and declares they (the pairings) aren't alike at all. Thus, she implies that this detail is the only one she contests and her response supports the depiction of her as an obsessive Yaoi Fangirl.
-   In _Slayers_, of all the names Xelloss gets called, he's only visibly offended when Filia calls him "garbage".
-   A variation from _Space Pirate Mito_. The Galactic Patrol is looking for the main character, Aoi Mitsukuni, and to flush him out, they announce his "crimes" to the general populace, hoping they'll hand him over. In order, this includes being the son of a wanted Space Pirate, seducing woman, being a ten-foot monster (and apparently a gremlin), and disrespecting his parents, since he injured his mother and ran away.

(He really meant the last one, though the first is also true).

-   John Mulaney uses this a lot in his comedy. For example:
    
    "When I was a boy I was often confused with a woman, sometimes, over the phone, because before puberty I had a voice like a little flute. I was once on the telephone with Blockbuster Video \[...\] I'd called them a couple of times in one day to ask about a movie. And I called for a third time \[...\] And the guy at Blockbuster went "Hey lady! I'll _tell_ you when we get _Addams Family Values_!" But look, I wasn't offended as a boy being confused with a lady. I was offended as a lady, who was getting pushed around by this chauvenistic asshole who works at _Blockbuster Video_, talking to me like I'm some floozy!"

    **Caller 2:** He sure is. At least that's what his nephew Donald said.

    **Scrooge:** _\[completely deadpan\]_ You think I'm old? You wound me.

    **Hal Jordan:** What is, Amon? Me about to break your nose with your father's ring?  
    **Amon Sur:** You dying here. Killed by Sinestro's army. Alone. You've been despised and abandoned by your corps.

-   The _Touhou Project_ fanfic _Monsters In Paradise_ features this exchange between Kanako and Suwako, concerning the recreation that the latter seems to enjoy:

    **Ichigo:** Don't call me a child.  
    **Urahara:** And you skip right over with the frightening part.
    
-   _This Bites!_: Chapter 7.

    **Zoro:** I am _not_ grumpy.  
    **Soundbite:** **THAT'S** _what_ **_you_** PROTEST?
    
    -   Chapter 25: After Robin accidentally insults everything about Shogun Octavio and his country (due to Vivi not reading the translation guide thoroughly), Octavio says he would have laughed off all of them except they insulted his surfing ability, which is unforgivable.
    -   Chapter 25, after the chapter's events, a couple of listeners express their thoughts:
        
        **Buggy:** A Devil Fruit user being a natural surfer, better than someone who was literally born for the sport? That's just insane.  
        **Alvida:** It does sound ridiculous when you say it like that, doesn't it? About as ridiculous as surviving an execution attempt thanks to a lightning bolt striking the tower.  
        **Buggy:** Indeed.  
        **Alvida:** Or as ridiculous as how losing some freckles can make a world of difference in helping people perceive your natural beauty.  
        **Buggy:** Yes, that's... just as ridiculous.  
        **Alvida:** Or as ridiculous as a nearly no-name clown-themed pirate from the East Blue managing to survive two days in the Grand Line, much less two months.  
        **Buggy:** Okay, now that's just insa— WHAT THE HELL DID YOU JUST CALL ME, WOMAN!?

    **John:** What I wanna talk about is where the Hell do you get off talking about me like that to the cops?!

    **Sinbad:** Wait a minute. I didn't lie.
    
-   _South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut_
    -   A hilarious reversal of this trope:

-   This was even done in _Citizen Kane_ (1941). It should be noted that during the time period this scene takes place, being called an "anarchist" would be like being called a communist or a terrorist.

    **Jack:** You're being a common nuisance.  
    **Sean:** What did you just call me?  
    **Jack;** 'Nuisance'?  
    **Sean:** No, the other one!

**Jack:** You're still just a common killer.  
**Sean:** What did you call me?  
**Jack:** 'Killer?'  
**Sean:** No, the other one!

-   Happens in _Hocus Pocus_, though this has more to do with the witches being from the nineteenth century and not _quite_ grasping modern slang.
    
    **Jay:** Man, how come it's always the ugly chicks that stay out late!?  
    **Winifred:** Chicks?
    
-   _In & Out_ combines this with Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking during a clip from the fake Oscar-winning movie _To Protect and Serve_ (which is a spoof of Oscar Bait cliche). In the fake movie, Danny is a gay soldier who's being drummed out of the service after being outed. The following exchange occurs during a climactic military tribunal:
    
    **Attorney:** Your sergeant came across the following items in your footlocker. Will you kindly tell the court if they are yours. A letter to another soldier?  
    **Danny:** Yes, sir.  
    **Attorney:** A photograph signed "Danny, San Francisco"?  
    **Danny:** Yes, sir.  
    **Attorney:** An autographed copy of _Beaches_, starring Bette Midler?  
    **Danny:** GIVE THAT BACK!
    
-   _In Bruges_ combines this with Even Evil Has Loved Ones and a whole lot of crude language.

    **Harry:** You fucking retract that statement about my cunt fucking kids!  
    **Ken:** I retract the statement about your cunt fucking kids.

    **Tony Stark:** "Textbook... narcissism"? _\[looks at Fury\]_  
    **Nick Fury:** _\[level stare\]_  
    **Tony Stark:** ... Agreed.
    
-   _Juan of the Dead_: Juan and Lázaro need to get zombies to come out of hiding. Simple screaming does not do it. Lázaro tries name-calling, shouting "Iconoclasts!" and "Bastards!" Zombies don't appear until he yells "ANARCHO-DISSIDENTS!"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In _Laurel Canyon_, Christian Bale sarcastically thanks his mother (Frances McDormand) for encouraging his fiancee (Kate Beckinsale) to fit in, noting that she's spending her time getting stoned and reading _Spin_ magazine. His mother retorts, "I've never read _Spin_."
-   Woody Allen's _Love and Death_:

    **Chelsea:** I am _not_ in denial!
    
-   _Major Payne_:

    **Clayton:** This may amuse you.  
    _\[gives Laurience a newspaper with a gossipy article about his experiments.\]_  
    **Dr. Laurience:** You told them all this!  
    **Clayton:** Me? Why me?  
    **Dr. Laurience:** How should I know? Your mind is just as twisted as your body. Don't forget, if I leave out one injection...  
    **Clayton:** I don't mind dying, but to be accused of journalism!

    **Jack:** You sprung a man from jail, commandeered a ship of the fleet, sailed with a buccaneer crew out of Tortuga, and you're completely obsessed with treasure.  
    **Will:** That's not true! I am NOT obsessed with treasure.  
    **Jack:** Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.
    
-   _Pretty Persuasion_: When the English teacher is being accused of sexually molesting his students, Randa testifies that he told her "I'm gonna touch your boobs". He bursts out that he would have used "breasts".
-   In _The Quick and the Dead_, Herod is more offended at Cort telling the Lady to back out of the tournament—rather than how, immediately after, that they argue over which one of them will kill him.
-   In _Revenge of the Nerds_, Stan Gable taunts Ogre to get him to raise the barbell he's trying to lift:
    
    **Stan:** Get it up! Come on! You're shit! You're nothin'! You're scum! You suck! YOU'RE NICE!  
    **Ogre:** _\[finally lifting barbell\]_ NO, I'M NOT!
    
-   _Robin and the 7 Hoods_:
    
    **Foreman:** For four weeks, this jury has listened to the testimony. The defendant not only supposedly killed the sheriff...he started the Chicago Fire and killed Cock Robin.  
    I've been a house detective for years and I've seen good ringers. I think the prosecution deserves congratulations for having the best collection of shifty-eyed, double-crossing two-faced liars.  
    This jury declares the defendant innocent.  
    **Guy Gisborne:** Who mentioned Cock Robin?
    
-   In _The Room (2003)_, combined with an Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking. Though in all fairness, this was likely _meant_ as "If you're lying about that, you might be lying about his hitting you" — except we _do_ see him drink.
    
    **Claudette:** Well, at least **you** have a good man.  
    **Lisa:** You're wrong. He didn't get his promotion. And he got drunk last night. And he hit me.  
    **Claudette:** Johnny doesn't drink!
    
-   From _Shaun of the Dead_:
    
    **Liz:** You, hang out with my friends? A failed actress and a twat?  
    **Shaun:** Well, that's a bit harsh.  
    **Liz:** Your words, Shaun!  
    **Shaun:** I did not call Diane a failed actress!
    
    -   Justified in that calling a friend a "twat" would fall under Vitriolic Best Buds. Bringing up someone is suffering failure in their career, however, is low.
-   From _Suburban Commando_, after General Suitor suggests the President tell his men to surrender the battle which Suitor is clearly winning:
    
    **President:** I will not ask my people to give up everything they know, to serve a sadistic, egotistical, homicidal maniac!  
    **General Suitor:** I do not consider myself egotistical! _Proud_, maybe...
    
-   _Tall Tale_: You can insult Pecos Bill to his face, or you can insult his mama or his horse. But don't ever insult Texas or you'll regret it.
-   Done in _They Call Me Trinity_ where Trinity is explaining to Bambino (his brother) why they had to beat somebody up.
    
    **Trinity:** He called our mother an old... _\[whispers\]_  
    **Bambino:** She is.  
    **Trinity:** She's not that old.
    
-   _Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri_: When Robbie calls Mildred "an old cunt", Mildred snaps back "I'm not old!" (although it is done with good humour, to show that she didn't take the insult seriously).

-   _A Chorus of Dragons_: When Tyentso confronts Gadrith over having murdered a friend of hers and experimented on his soul, he is completely unfazed at her accusations — but he does take genuine offense at her claim that he botched the actual soul-binding.
-   _Ciaphas Cain_: Cain writes at one point that "Bribery and threats are popular methods for getting what you want, but the Inquisition is better at both and tend to resent other people using them." Inquisitor Amberly Vail replies in a footnote, "Entirely untrue. The Inquisition is most definitely above such petty emotions as resentment."
-   _Code Name Verity_: Queenie recalls when a German she was interrogating called her a "filthy English whore". "A whore— maybe I'll consider that in desperation; filthy, it goes without saying; but whatever else the hell I am, I AM NOT ENGLISH." In reality she was insulted because she's _Scottish_, but the anger was in character for her interrogation persona: a fellow German.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   _Making Money_ features this exchange between Cosmo Lavish and our hero, Moist von Lipwig:
        
        _Cosmo half-turned, to make certain the crowd heard everything he said. "You are a thief, Mr. Lipwig. A cheat and a liar, and embezzler and have no dress sense whatsoever."  
        "I say, that's a bit on the harsh side," said Moist as the men swept through. "I happen to think I dress rather snappily!"_

    -   In _Proven Guilty_, Harry calls Murphy a "savvy cop chick". Murphy objects to "cop chick" and Harry amends it to "police chick" and she is fine with that.
-   From the _Honor Harrington_ series, specifically the fifth book, _Flag in Exile_:
    
    **Honor:** Gentlemen, in case you missed it, this is Captain Brigham, my chief of staff. Keep an eye on her and don't let that calm demeanor fool you. She has a low and evil sense of humor.  
    **Mercedes:** A base libel, Milady. My sense of humor isn't low.
    
-   Hercule Poirot. You can call him annoying, you can call him meddling, you can call him troublesome, you can call him short, but _don't call him French_. Truth in Television: This is, indeed, a Berserk Button for many Belgians; like calling a Canadian American or a New Zealander Australian.
-   From Christopher Moore's _Island of the Sequined Love Nun_:
    
    "I get you out of typhoon alive and you just yell and say bad things. I quit. You get new navigator. Roberto say you mean, nasty, Chevy-driving, milk-drinking, American dog fucker."

-   In L. Jagi Lamplighter's _Prospero in Hell_, Ulysses is deeply offended that an article describing him as a murderer says that his name came from James Joyce's book and not Homer.
-   In _Snow (2004)_, when Ka sees that a local newspaper has printed a front-page article accusing him of being a spy and inciting civil unrest, he is most bothered by its referring to him as a "so-called poet."
-   Done brilliantly in a _A Song of Ice and Fire_, when Brienne calls Jaime a monster.
    
    What makes it even funnier is that the king in question was insane and about to kill a lot of people so the regicide was justified.
    
-   A hilariously values-dissonant example in _To Kill a Mockingbird_: Jem is worried about a gang coming after his father, and Atticus assures him that there have never been any gangs in Maycomb. Jem says the Ku Klux Klan "got after some Catholics one time." Atticus says, "Never heard of any Catholics in Maycomb either."
-   In the _Wizard in Rhyme_ series, following an unusual entrance and some accidental magic, Matt is accused of being an evil sorcerer on grounds of conjuring a thunderstorm, turning base metal to silver, flooding the job market with unskilled workers and turning an innocent baker into a toad.

    **Phanan:** Hey. I resent the use of the word _miserable_.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   In an episode of _30 Rock_, Avery is detained in North Korea. Eventually, her captors let her appear on television to explain how she's being treated:
    
    **Avery:** For the past three weeks, I have been honored to partake in a political reeducation regimen. I have voluntarily taken several floggings for being an arrogant American.  
    **Jack:** That's okay. She's tough. We do a lot of pirate-themed sexual role play. I'm a parrot.  
    **Avery:** Also, I spend eight hours a day breaking concrete blocks to learn to be an obedient worker.  
    **Jack:** No problem. She pays a thousand dollars an hour to do that with her trainer.  
    **Avery:** And I have concluded that capitalism may be flawed.  
    **Jack:** WHAT ARE THOSE MONSTERS DOING TO HER?!
    
-   From _Absolutely Fabulous_, Edina is concerned that when she dies, she won't leave a legacy behind:

    -   In "Broken Promises", Mack refers to Aida as a crazy, murderous sex bot. Her creator, Dr. Radcliffe, objects — he never had sex with her, they're just friends. Fitz facepalms at this.
-   _Angel_ is particularly sensitive to this.
    -   Example in episode "Conviction":
        
        **Bad Guy:** You pathetic, little fairy.  
        **Angel:** Hey! I am _not_ little.
        
    -   In the comics, Faith screws up. Again. This time working as a bodyguard for Kennedy. She's protecting a wannabe rock star, who is into underage girls, when her father storms in and Faith finds this out she attacks him, the rocker turns into a demon, and Kennedy has to intervene. When Faith explains what happened she is most upset not that their client was attacked but the suggestion she condones what he did.
-   A variation (possibly an inversion) from _Arrested Development_, after the publicist has just told the family that Michael is the most likeable member of the family:
    
    **Publicist:** There are very few intelligent, attractive and straight men in this town.  
    **Tobias Fünke:** Well, that leaves me out.  
    _\[silence, everyone stares\]_  
    **Tobias Fünke:** She did say single, right? I-I-I thought she said single.
    
-   _Barbary Coast_: This exchange in "Funny Money":
    
    **Jeff:** If they think you're a beady-eyed killer...  
    **Cash:** What do you mean 'beady-eyed'?
    
-   _Battlestar Galactica_:
    
    **John Cavil:** Yes, but Fives in general haven't been that impressive thus far. One of your counterparts managed to get himself outted back on Ragnar Station.  
    **Aaron Doral:** I can't understand how he was discovered... I heard it was Dr. Baltar.  
    **Cavil:** Well, I'm not talking about that exactly. I'm talking about the fact that you're walking around this fleet wearing _that_ jacket, and more importantly, that _face_. You're recognizable.  
    **Doral:** Uh... Well... His jacket was burgundy... This is _teal_...
    
-   On a Dutch channel, BNN, there was a short-lived spoof of _Jerry Springer_ called Jimmy Hopper. One of the stagehands was a homosexual. When one of the guests refused to be calmed down by a "Dirty faggot", the stagehand jumped up and screamed "I'M NOT DIRTY!" and attacked the guy.

        **Troy:** _Whoa!_ That's a _good_ Jeff! How did you do that?

    **Jane:** You don't _what_?  
    **Oliver:** And I don't buy the "crazy, wacky Jane" thing. And I don't buy the you 'follow the philosophy of plants' thing. I think you're terrified you're not interesting enough, so you'll make up any old rubbish just to get attention. Do me a favour: look in the mirror. The way you look as if you have to try.  
    **Jane:** I am _so_ bisexual!

    **Dr. Brown:** I can't believe you think my beard is ugly.
    
-   From _Eureka_:
    
    **Jack Carter:** It's only a matter of time before Allison sees you for who you really are: which is a smug, selfish, Einstein-wannabe with no moral compass and only one functioning kidney.

    **Jack Carter:** Day's not over, is it?

They'll die in pain, and they'll do it so that plump little lords like you can enjoy their warm summer afternoons down south in the capital.

-   _Little Heroes_ was a mid-1970s show, locally produced by WXON-TV 20 in Detroit. It was an apparent attempt to do a modern version of Hal Roach's _Our Gang_, aka _The Little Rascals_.

A recurring line between them was:
    
    **Spy 1:** You are ze idiot, you are ze fool, you are za im-be-seel, you...are...za...NERD!  
    **Spy 2:** I am NOT za nerd!!

-   A _M\*A\*S\*H_ episode has a variation of this.

    -   And at the end of "Need to Know".

-   In the _Stargate SG-1_ episode "Citizen Joe", after a list of things O'Neill should be denying...

You once visited a planet called Argos, and the nanites in your blood caused you to age artificially. You've had the entire repository of the Ancients' knowledge downloaded into your brain. Twice! You have a thing for _The Simpsons_, fishing, Mary Steenburgen, the color peridot, and you're a terrible ping pong player.  
    \[...\]

    **Scotty:** No sir, they also compared you with a Denebian slime devil.  
    **Kirk:** I see.  
    **Scotty:** And then they said that you were...  
    **Kirk:** I get the picture, Scotty.  
    **Scotty:** Yes, sir.  
    **Kirk:** And after they said all this, that's when you hit the Klingons.  
    **Scotty:** No, sir.  
    **Kirk:** No?  
    **Scotty:** No, er, I didn't. You told us to avoid trouble.  
    **Kirk:** Oh, yes.  
    **Scotty:** Well, I didn't see that it was worth fighting about. After all, we're big enough to take a few insults, aren't we?  
    **Kirk:** What was it they said that started the fight?  
    **Scotty:** They called the _Enterprise_ a garbage scow, sir.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

-   _The Thick of It_:
    -   Any discussion with Malcolm Tucker is usually filled with insults, but even he has his limits:
        
        **Oliver Reeder:** Malcolm! You're bullying me, and I dunno why you're bullying me...  
        **Malcolm Tucker:** How dare you! _How dare you!_ Don't you ever, _ever_ call me a bully! I'm _so_ much worse than that.
        
    -   More of an Insult Backfire that one... a better example would be Malcolm's attempt to derail Geoff Holhurst's leadership bid:
        
        **Malcolm Tucker:** First, you've got no credentials — you're so backbench you've actually fuckin' fallen off... secondly, I'm going to tell the _Mirror_ about all the drinking... and thirdly, I'm going to tell the _Mail_ about the affair... and fourthly, you've got a tiny head...  
        **Geoff Holhurst:** No I haven't!

    Pro Wrestling 

-   During a feud in ECW, Terry Funk attempted to provoke Cactus Jack into fighting him due to Foley relinquishing his hardcore ways and showing his support for rival company WCW. Funk's initial attempts to call out Foley were unsuccessful as he called Foley's wife, mother, and his children whores in succession. But he successfully managed to provoke Foley to the ring after calling WCW President Eric Bischoff a homo. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  The two did a reprise of this exchange in 2006 in the hype of their upcoming tag team match at ECW One Night Stand 2006. This time, however, Funk's final insult was that WWE sucked, causing Foley to cheap shot Funk with a punch.

-   A variation (or an aversion) appears in radio comedy _About A Dog_, after Muriel's lover turns out to be married. Sarah is her daughter:
    
    **Sarah:** Oh Mum, I'm so sorry.  
    **Muriel:** Oh, it's my own fault. I'm just a silly old woman.  
    **Sarah:** Mum, you're not silly.  
    **Muriel:** _\[pause\]_ And?  
    **Sarah:** And you're not an old woman.
    
-   The _Adventures in Odyssey_ episode "Aloha, Oy!" has an odd twist:
    
    **Doris Rathbone**: Oh great, we're stuck out on the ocean in a soggy, rickety old rust bucket!  
    **Captain Quid**: Soggy, aye. Rickety, perhaps. Old rust bucket, maybe. But rat-infested?  
    **Doris**: I didn't say rat-infested!  
    **Quid**: I know, but she's also rat-infested.
    
-   This appears in a famous Sal & Richard prank call from _The Howard Stern Show_. While calling a public access television show, the caller asks the panel if he can "ask that fat white bitch a question". One of the male panelists responds with "She's not white!" after they cut the caller off.
-   _Safety Catch_:
    
    **Simon:** First up, I'm going to stop being an arms dealer! I fell into it in the first place, I've never wanted to do it, and it's basically a job for warped, amoral sociopaths!  
    **Boris:** Hey! I'm not warped.
    
-   Ghost, from _True Capitalist_ radio, is often accused of being a racist, shapeshifting Jew. His response is always "I'M NOT A JEW!" In one episode, he was assaulted by a caller who, in a parody of _Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer_, called him a racist, a fruitbowl, a hambone, and a reptilian. However, Ghost only raged once he brought up "Hannukah night," failing to even notice the line after it accused him of beating his son.
    -   Another instance has a caller claim there's a party at Ghost's house with "free beer, a mountain of cocaine, and girls under 18". Ghost's response is "I don't do cocaine!". Knowing him, one would think he'd react to the "girls under 18" part.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _F.A.T.A.L._ provides a real-world example. The author's retort to the game being described as "the date-rape RPG"? That there are no rules included for dating.

    Theater 

-   A variation is used in the musical _1776_. Abigail Adams recites a list of her faults that her husband sent her in a letter; John insists that he didn't mean most of them, but is forced to admit that "You _are_ pigeon-toed". In a later scene, John begins to list his own faults and Abigail reassures him, but concedes, "You _are_ pigheaded."
    
    An actual honest-to-god historical exchange; it's paraphrased from a series of letters written while they were courting. At first glance, the Adamses had an interesting and slightly tumultuous marriage, but it's only partly true. You just need to read the letters with the right mindset. John and Abigail were pretty much the only happy marriage of any of our founding fathers (the others were either full of tragedy or were political marriages), and they enjoyed the back-and-forth. Honestly, you could say they were the closest thing to soulmates you could find.
    
-   Inverted in the 2003 musical _Avenue Q,_ when Lucy the Slut tells a jilted Princeton that she isn't going to cling to "some well-hung baby face kid, who leeches from his parents and can't get his act together!", and then stalks haughtily away. Princeton slowly faces the audience and says, "I think I heard a compliment in there!" and proceeds to follow her off-stage.
-   During one of their arguments in _Boston Marriage_, Claire calls Anna an "evil old bitch". Anna immediately and indignantly denies being old but lets the rest of the description pass without comment.
-   In Woody Allen's play _God_:
    
    **Writer:** May I remind you, you're a starving, out-of-work actor whom I've generously consented to let appear in my play in an effort to assist your comeback.  
    **Actor:** Starving, yes... Out of work, perhaps... Hoping for a comeback, maybe — but a drunkard?  
    **Writer:** I never said you were a drunkard.  
    **Actor:** Yes, but I'm also a drunkard.
    
-   From _Next to Normal_:
    
    **Natalie:** Oh, you're one of those pretentious stoner types.  
    **Henry:** That's totally unfair!... I'm not pretentious.
    
-   In _The Norman Conquests_, Ruth tells her husband that he's "deceitful, odious, conceited, self-centred, selfish, inconsiderate and shallow." Norman angrily denies being shallow.
-   From the 1974 musical adaptation of _The Phantom of the Opera_ (by Ken Hill, not Andrew Lloyd Webber):
    
    **Carlotta:** And-a _you_ keep your tubby torso out of this, you fat little faggot!  
    **Faust:** What do you mean, "little"?
    
-   In _The Scarlet Sails_, Assol learns that Mrs. Menners and Menners Jr. refuse to drop their charges against her father. She is shocked but continues to plead with them.

        **Judge:** I mean the bank robbery!
        
    -   When Darkwing is called a second-rate jerk, he objects saying that he's a _first-_rate jerk.
    -   Inverted in "Just Us Justice Ducks" when Darkwing is beating himself up over failing to prevent the Fearsome Five from taking over the city.
        
        **Darkwing Duck:** I'm dirt. I'm worse than dirt. I'm lower than low! I am not the Terror that Flaps in the Night! I am the self-centered boob who hands over the city at the drop of a dime! I'm a...a gipnoid, a slug, a sput-mothering jackanape!  
        **Launchpad:** \*sincerely\* Ah, c'mon. You're not a slug.
        
    -   An exchange also occurs at the end of the episode "Mutantcy on the Bouncy" after Darkwing and the Rubber Chicken defeat Cement Head.
        
        **Rubber Chicken:** And you did pretty good...for a vain, pig-headed, loudmouthed, snooty, egomaniacal waffle-brain!  
        **Darkwing:** Hey! I am not vain!
        
-   In an episode of _Dave the Barbarian_, Uncle Oswidge suggests using his magic to deal with a zit that Candy is freaking out over, leading to the following exchange:

    **Oswidge**: I'm not that short.

-   In the _Ewoks_ episode "Party Ewok", Kneesa rebukes the leader of a gang of punks called the Pugs by saying that he's just a dirty, no-good common thief. The leader of the Pugs replies "Who are you calling 'common'?"
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   In the episode, "No Chris Left Behind," Lois reads a heading from a very outdated school textbook (this was an alternate scene that was used when aired on Cartoon Network and on DVD; the FOX version used a different take in which the heading Lois reads is about Israel being an up-and-coming country):
        
        **Lois:** "Negroes: America's Dancin'est Rape-Folk." That's _awful_! We don't use the word "Negro" anymore!
        
    -   In "Back to the Woods" Peter impersonates James Woods and goes on TV to talk about how he (meaning Woods) is making a wacky comedy movie about the September 11th terrorist attacks. And it'll co-star David Spade as the voice of the plane.
        
        **James Woods:** _What?! I would NEVER work with David Spade! That ... dwarf! That ... skinny ... chicken-shit!_
        
    -   In "The Tan Aquatic with Steve Zissou", Chris's bully Kyle calls Peter things such as "big, dumb butt-face" and "dorky, fat numb-nuts", but it's only when he calls Peter a "poop-nose" that he gives him a No-Holds-Barred Beatdown.
    -   A variation happens in the Donald Trump episode, where Trump tells Peter that his show has taught Jewish, black, and gay jokes to countless children. Peter insists that they don't use as many gay jokes anymore.

    -   "Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?":

    -   "When Aliens Attack", after Amy replaces her stolen bikini top:

        **Amy:** _French?!_
        
    -   Fry in "War is the H-Word", being dressed down by Zapp for cowering from battle:

        **Fry:** That wasn't cowardice!
        
    -   In "Bender's Big Score" when Professor's doomsday bomb is replaced with a rose and note saying "You've been scammed, sweetheart."

    -   Played with in "The Farnsworth Parabox":

-   _Grossology_:
    
    **Paige:** I came for a party and no creepy, weirdo, Goth loser is going to stop me!

-   _Invader Zim_
    -   In "TAK: The Hideous New Girl":

Pizzazz snaps back that she is not loud.
-   _Justice League_ episode "The Brave and the Bold". (Although the Flash _would_ be insulted by that word in particular.)
    
    **Gorilla Grodd:** Humans are slow, ugly, immoral, and have an unpleasant body odor!  
    **Flash:** Hey, who you calling slow?
    
-   From the "Animal Attraction" episode of _Kim Possible_:
    
    **Ron:** _\[reading from a book\]_ "The Pink Sloth is an outcast, a follower, socially inept, and smells of overripe fruit." I do _not_ smell of overripe fruit!
    
    -   And when a rotten banana peel came out of his pocket...
-   An example from the _King of the Hill_ episode "Traffic Jam," at the end of the episode, Hank and Roger are joking with each other using "Yo' Momma" jokes.
    
    **Roger 'Booda' Sack:** It's been so long since yo' momma's last bath, that her hairy armpits smell like propane gas!  
    **Hank:** Now hold on there, fella, a joke's a joke but now you've gone too far. You see propane is actually odorless, what you smell was put there by man for safety reasons...
    
-   In the _Loonatics Unleashed_ episode "Apocalypso":
    
    **Queen Athena:** I liked how you dealt with the obnoxious one with the big beak.  
    **Danger Duck:** Hey! I'll have you know my beak is exactly the right size for my head!
    
-   _Looney Tunes_:
    -   The 1948 short _Daffy Duck Slept Here_:

        **Daffy Duck:** _Unsanitary?!_
        
    -   Daffy Duck goes to this well again in the 1953 short _Muscle Tussle_, after his girlfriend dumps him for a bodybuilder.
        
        **Melissa Duck:** Goodbye, you scrawny little nine-pound weakling.  
        **Daffy Duck:** How do you like that? Calling me a scrawny little nine-pound weakling... when it's perfectly obvious I'm a scrawny little _ten_\-pound weakling. Humph!
        
    -   In _Dumb Patrol_, set during World War I: Bugs Bunny, sent by the Allied Nations to vanquish Germany's deadliest pilot, Baron Sam Von Schpamm (AKA Yosemite Sam), drops Sam a letter and a boquet of flowers:
        
        **Sam:** What's this? _(reading)_ "Dear baron: Roses are Red / Violets are Blue / A Leghorn's a Chicken / And so are you"?! Why, that dummkopf! He even spelled "Baron" with a small "b"! _(reads some more)_ "P.S., I enclosed a big "B" in the flowers."
        
-   In one episode of _The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack_, Peppermint Larry refuses to extend credit to Flapjack and Cap'n K'nuckles because "Everybody knows you don't have any money!" K'nuckles indignantly replies "Stop lyin'! Not _everyone_ knows that."
-   Once per Episode on _Megas XLR_, when Coop decides Let's Get Dangerous!, he gives a monologue listing off all the reasons that the Monster of the Week deserves the ass-whooping they are about to get. The last item on the list — and the one Coop is by _far_ the angriest about — is always something extremely petty and trivial. Or something that was actually his own fault.
-   A slight variation, from _Mission Hill_:
    
    **Andy:** I run strip clubs and date sleazy women.  
    **Shelly:** Hey, how's that supposed to make me feel?  
    **Andy:** Sorry, not women. Woman. Just you.  
    **Shelly:** Oh Andy, you say the sweetest things.

        -   "To Where and Back Again – Part 2": Trixie and Discord constantly argue back and forth with each other while on their rescue mission with Starlight and Thorax. While they are powerless without magic and arguing over which of them is more useful on the mission, Discord says that, once the throne is destroyed and he has his magic back, he'll be all-powerful again and be able to easily save their friends, while she'll still be "a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist". Trixie is incensed at being called "self-absorbed".
            
            **Trixie:** Self-absorbed?!
            
-   _Phineas and Ferb_: A visual version comes up in an episode; Phineas mentions they've made a chariot for Candace that looks just like her... and is actually a repulsive gorgon. Candace responds while wearing a scowl that looks _just_ like the chariot:
    
    **Candace:** Oh, that's ridiculous! I do _not_ have wheels!

-   Played with a few times in _The Simpsons_:
    -   "Hurricane Neddy": Ned Flanders goes berserk and insults several of the people who tried unsuccessfully to rebuild his house after a hurricane struck. One can tell he was starting to run out of good insults by the time he got to Moe:
        
        **Ned:** You ugly, hate-filled man!  
        **Moe:** Hey, _hey_, I may be ugly and hate-filled, but I... um, what was that third thing you said?
        
    -   "Simpson Tide". When Homer is suspected of having defected to Russia, Grandpa Simpson is interviewed as to whether his son is a Communist:
        
        **Brockman:** Could Homer Simpson be a Communist? His father spoke out on his behalf.  
        **Abe:** My Homer is not a Communist. He may be a liar, a pig, an idiot, and a Communist, but he is _not_ a porn star!
        
    -   In a straight example (episode "Sideshow Bob Roberts"), Mayor Quimby was described as an "illiterate, tax-cheating, wife-swapping, pot-smoking Spend-o-crat", to which he was shown to reply: "Hey, I am no longer illiterate!" (while watering a cannabis plant in his closet).

    -   From "The Crepes of Wrath", Bart divulges to a French policeman the various injustices he's suffered while there: the owners of the chateau he's staying at work him to death, they make him sleep on the floor, and they put antifreeze in the wine. His response: "Antifreeze in the wine! That is a very serious crime!"
    -   A variation on the theme was when Otto thought Homer called him a bum, and he didn't mind that; in fact, he admitted it. However, when Bart pointed out that Homer had _actually_ called him a "sponge", not a bum, Otto really got angry.
    -   In "Baby, You Can't Drive My Car", Homer calls Mr. Burns a crazy, wrinkly, short piece of garbage. Mr. Burns is only upset about being called "short".
    -   Meta-example: in "Simpsons Confidential", John Ortved's oral history of the show, former showrunner Mike Reiss describes the Brazilian Tourist Council's complaint about the episode "Blame It On Lisa":
        
        "When the Simpsons came to Rio, they encountered grinding poverty, rat-infested slums, pickpockets, kidnappers, and wild monkeys. There are _no wild monkeys_ in Rio."
        
    -   In "Covercraft", after Apu leaves Homer's cover band for a bigger, more successful one, Lisa tells Homer he doesn't need to be jealous.
        
        **Homer:** I'm not jealous, I'm envious. Jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have. Envy is wanting what someone else has. What I feel is envy.

    **Mr. Krabs:** Well, if I was a robot - which I'm not! - at least I'm well put together; not some rusted-up, steam-driven, pile of junk!  
    **Plankton in the robot:** Who are you calling "steam-driven"?
    
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ has a scene where General Grievous confronts Jedi Master Eeth Koth:

-   In the _Total Drama Island_ episode "That's Off the Chain", Heather seems more shocked than insulted when Lindsay finally loses her temper and flips her off while calling her "a two-faced, backstabbing, lying little \*bleep\*", but what really seems to hurt is when Lindsay follows it up by telling her "And by the way, your shoes are _tacky_!"
-   From _Total Drama Action_:
    
    **Izzy:** If I can handle hand to paw combat with a polar bear, I can handle a bald emotionally withdrawn cook in a Halloween costume.  
    **Chef Hatchet:** Who are you calling a cook?
    
-   _Wander over Yonder_, with a side of I Resemble That Remark!:
    
    **Fortune-Teller:** Wait! The skies have shifted! The stars do not say you will be a strong and powerful leader! Now the stars say you are immature, awkward, and emotionally unstable!
    
    **Lord Hater:** I AM NOT EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE!!! _(flips table)_
    
-   From the _Young Justice_ episode "Satisfaction:"

    Real Life 

-   _Not Always Right_ has conversations such as this and this.
-   When Michael Buckly made fun of rival figure skaters Evan Lysacek and Johnny Weir on his YouTube show _What the Buck?_, declaring that the wannabe-macho Evan and flamboyant Johnny were "totally doing it" and probably texted each other all day, Johnny posted the following message to Buckley's MySpace in response: "Love it, bitch! We totally don't text!"
-   George V of the United Kingdom: When H. G. Wells' remarked at the beginning of World War I that the British royal house of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (in addition to being a mouthful) was "alien and uninspiring",<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  King George (allegedly) responded: "I may be uninspiring, but I'll be damned if I'm alien!" (Considering how relations were with Germany at the time, he picked the right part to complain about.) George changed the name of the House to The House of Windsor, which it remains to this day. Not only that, but he relinquished all his titles outside of the United Kingdom, struck off all the royal honours of any member of the house that fought for the Central Powers, and demanded (and got) a bill from Parliament allowing him to strip those relatives of their British peerages as well.
-   Mike Tyson is attributed to have said "He called me a rapist and a recluse. I'm not a recluse." Considering that he was convicted of and spent jail time for sexual assault, the first bit is pretty much water under the bridge.
-   In an interview on the show _The Screen Savers_, Jhonen Vasquez (creator of _Johnny the Homicidal Maniac_ and _Invader Zim_) responded to host Kevin Pereira's comment that fans considered him "a goth king", saying disdainfully: "King, yeah, but goth... I mean, that's just arrogant."

-   Max Mosley, Formula One boss and son of British Fascist leader Oswald Mosley sued _The News of The World_ for alleging that he took part in a sadomasochist Nazi-themed orgy with five prostitutes on the grounds that there was no Nazi theme to the event. He did admit in court that the "sadomasochist orgy with five prostitutes" part of the allegation was essentially correct; it was the allegations of Nazism that constituted the defamation. Didn't stop people from invoking Those Wacky Nazis. Having German army jackets present and people speaking German might have had something to do with that.
-   Inverted in The Other Wiki's article on toilet paper orientation. The _Weekly World News_ once alleged that, because dictator Kim Jong-il watches the Home Shopping Network, is a member of Oprah's Book Club, and complains about toilet paper that's over instead of under, he is secretly a woman.
    
    "The story's subhead reads, 'Dictator Kim Jong-il is a Woman', although North Korean officials have argued that Kim is not, in fact, a dictator."
    
-   Rue McClanahan had this to say about her iconic role on _The Golden Girls_: "People always ask me if I'm like Blanche. And I say, 'Well, Blanche was an oversexed, self-involved, man-crazy, vain Southern Belle from Atlanta. And I'm not from Atlanta.'"
-   During an interview, Tim Schafer once labeled Robert Kotick, Activision's CEO, as "a dick" and "total prick", and accused him of not actually being interested in games, but rather in the money to be had in them, Activision's response? "Hey, he does like games!"
-   On a darker note, the first commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, Rudolf Höss. When accused of the murder of three and a half million people in The Holocaust, Höss replied, "No. Only two and one-half million—the rest died of disease and starvation."
-   Lady Gaga once went on _The Tonight Show_ and was asked if there were any annoying rumors she'd like to dispel. Most people expected her to deny rumors she was a hermaphrodite, but she chose just to clarify that she wasn't from Yonkers.
-   The Westboro Baptist Church protested outside a Bill Maher stand-up gig in Kansas, handing out fliers that referred to him as "Christ-hating half-Jew pedophile rape-enabling Catholic Bill Maher." His response on _Real Time_? "How dare you call me a Catholic!"
-   William Wallace, when accused of a number of crimes by the English after being captured, only defended himself by saying he was not treasonous because he never swore loyalty to the English monarchy or any of its servants.
-   From ThinkGeek.com, in the product description for the d20 soaps: "We are NOT weirdo, basement-dwelling outcasts who never shower. We do so shower."
-   An anti-war British politician once called Christopher Hitchens "a drink-sodden ex-Trotskyist popinjay". Hitchens replied, "Only some of that is true." He later elaborated "He says that I am an ex-Trotskyist (true), a "popinjay" (true enough, since the word's original Webster's definition is a target for arrows and shots) and that I cannot hold a drink (here I must protest)."
-   After Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was shot, the shooter was linked to a white nationalist group known as American Renaissance. A government memo reported, "The group’s ideology is anti-government, anti-immigration, anti-ZOG (Zionist Occupational Government), anti-Semitic." Jared Taylor, the head of American Renaissance, responded that his group was not anti-Zionist.
-   Steven Seagal was accused of driving a tank into a man's house, flanked by dozens of police in Riot Gear, and shooting the man's dog because the man allegedly ran a cockfighting ring. Steven's response? He was outraged that someone would say he'd hurt a dog. (Turns out the dog bit wasn't true after all.)
-   _South Park_ episode "Go God Go" portrayed Richard Dawkins as a hateful man who has an insane lover Mr. Garrison and a bad British accent. The actual man himself, after seeing the episode, complained about the bad British accent.
-   Howard Hughes was a highly controversial figure due to his eccentricity and, to some extent, his wealth. His synopsis of his fame:
    
    "I'm not a paranoid deranged millionaire. Goddamit, I'm a billionaire!"
    
-   One controversy that arose from DC Comics' New Universe reboot was _Teen Titans_ member Starfire (featured in _Red Hood and the Outlaws_) being reduced from Action Girl into a slutty Ms. Fanservice. Even the 7-year-old daughter of a comics fan complained about how Star spent the whole comic posing in a bikini and never did anything remotely heroic. DC's response? "Thank you for talking about our comics, but maybe you should monitor what your child reads."
-   There's an English legal anecdote about a judge who was called a "big-nosed bastard cunt" by an angry defendant. When his wife was told about this, her response was "but you haven't got a big nose".
-   One of the British politicians jailed over expenses fraud was told by a journalist that people working with him had described him as arrogant, autocratic and rude. Right on schedule, he said he didn't think he was rude.
-   A YouTube commenter, responding to this video:
-   The English actress Nell Gwyn was The Mistress of King Charles II of England. When an angry mob stopped her carriage, calling her a "Catholic whore" (they mistook her for Charles' _other_ mistress, Louise de Kérouaille, a French Catholic from Brittany) she replied "Pray, good people, be civil.

    "These Republican leaders have not been content with attacks on me, or my wife, or on my sons. No, not content with that, they now include my little dog, Fala. Well, of course, I don't resent attacks, and my family don't resent attacks, but Fala does resent them...I am accustomed to hearing malicious falsehoods about myself...But I think I have a right to resent, to object, to libelous statements about my dog.
