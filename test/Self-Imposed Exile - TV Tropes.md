_"He was training a new generation of Jedi. There was nobody else left to do it, so he took the burden on himself. Everything was going great, until... one boy, an apprentice, turned against him and destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible. He just...walked away from everything."_

So you did something bad. It could be intentional, accidental, or against your will. Whatever you did, the act was so bad that there's nothing you can do to make up for what you've done, and a severe punishment is in order. Now that society hates you and the law is after you, you are left with two choices — either face society's contempt and accept your punishment or exile yourself from society.

This is the self-imposed version of The Exile where instead of society exiling the character, the character exiles themselves from it. For one reason or another, the character separating themselves from society will realize that because of the gravity of what they've done, society has no place for them. Another reason for their self-exile may be because they want to avoid punishment from law enforcement. Either way, the self-exiled character will be lucky if they can find the resources to survive outside of society, and if they aren't lucky, law enforcement will manage to catch up with them and arrest them.

Sometimes a person could be a part of a Government in Exile, even if they were not associated with the actions that led to that exile. For example the descendants of deposed monarchies may choose to continue to stay away from the current regime, even if the deposing antagonists died off generations ago. The modern descendants are not persecuted because they are so far removed that they are practically commoners at this point, especially if they are actually naturalized citizens of whatever country their deposed ancestors fled to. They may have more affinity for the country they were born in, as opposed to the country from which their royal or noble ancestors were exiled. And the current regime (which may be different from the deposing regime) may have no interest in an old ruling family whose status even its modern descendants no longer consider relevant. On the other hand, the descendants may still regard their once distinguished heritage with reverence but accept that You Can't Go Home Again, potentially tinged with a little Old Shame.

Compare No Place for Me There when a character exiles himself because of his well-meaning, but questionable deeds to create a better world. Also related to You Can't Go Home Again and Starting a New Life.
