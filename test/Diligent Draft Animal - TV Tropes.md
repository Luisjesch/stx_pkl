Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night...

_"Boxer was the admiration of everybody. He had been a hard worker even in Jones's time, but now he seemed more like three horses than one; there were days when the entire work of the farm seemed to rest on his mighty shoulders. From morning to night he was pushing and pulling, always at the spot where the work was hardest. His answer to every problem, every setback, was ‘I will work harder!’—which he adopted as his personal motto."_

Draft animals (donkeys, horses, mules, oxen, and water buffalo) are seen as symbols of determination, endurance, and servitude. This trope is when donkeys, horses, mules, oxen, and water buffalo are portrayed as hardworking animals that do a majority of the manual labor or use their strength to outplay their competitors. They are also used to symbolize determination, diligence, industriousness, and servitude.

In Western European cultures, horse riding and caring were once considered the sole purveyance of men. Riding was also associated with nobility, as owning and keeping a horse was expensive, making horse ownership a symbol of wealth. When ranchers in the American "Wild West" rode horses as they rounded up cattle, it became associated with agriculture, farming, and self-reliance.

Despite being seen as stubborn and stupid, mules and donkeys are seen as a better option than horses when it comes to manual labor because they are physically stronger and can carry more loads than horses. Hence mules and donkeys are called "Beasts of Burden" for carrying such heavy loads on journeys. The difference between a pack animal and a draft animal is that draft animals pull loads but do not carry them (horse and cart for example) whereas pack animals carry loads on their backs for transportation.

This trope doesn't strictly apply to horses and mules, oxen are also valid as a diligent draft animal. Oxen were originally used to plow fields and are still used for that reason in some countries. Horses eventually succeeded oxen specifically because they were seen as faster and more efficient.

For this trope to apply, it must involve donkeys, horses, mules, oxen, and water buffalo either as an animal or a motif, or physical features akin to the animal. A straightforward example of the trope would be where they are in an environment that shows their compulsion to work or shows their strength and hardiness with manual labour (like farm work or an industrial setting).

It doesn't always have to apply to manual labor or physical strength, as the animal or person must be shown working hard to achieve a goal and training hard to achieve their dreams.

For other entries on hardworking animals, see Mole Miner and Virtuous Bees. Automaton Horses is a related trope, where horses and other working animals are treated in a story essentially as machines.

It can go with Cool Horse but that horse trope is more about warhorses than workhorses. Stubborn Mule is about donkeys and mules being seen as stubborn and stupid, which may or may not overlap with this trope. Brutish Bulls is about bulls being portrayed as quick-tempered and violent. Virile Stallion is when horses are used as symbolism for unbridled masculinity and the male sex drive.

Despite Boxer's low intelligence, he's a hard worker and dismissive of the threats the pigs impose since he believes that every problem on the farm is a result of him not working hard enough.

-   _Classical Mythology_: Hephaestus, the god of fire, metalworking, and stone masonry, was associated with donkeys.
-   _Eastern Zodiac_: The second sign of the Chinese and Vietnamese zodiacs, the ox and the water buffalo (respectively), signify hard work, practicality, and down-to-earth people.
-   _Norse Mythology_:
    -   Svadilfari was the horse that belonged to the master builder who agreed to make the walls of Asgard and made a deal that if he could build the walls before winter, he could take Freyja as his bride as well as the sun and moon. However, the builder neglected to mention that Svadilfari was magical and was able to move so swiftly that the builder could finish the walls within a few days. Fearing the outcome, the Aesir gods demanded Loki fix the problem, which he did by transforming into a mare and distracting Svadilfari. When Loki finally reappeared and returned to Asgard, he was accompanied by a foal. This magical horse was named Sleipnir, and ended up as Odin's favourite steed.
    -   In another myth, a Swedish king named Gylfi promised a beggar woman the gift of all the land she could plow in a single day, not realizing that she was actually Gefjon, the goddess of the plow. Gefjon rallied her sons together in the form of gigantic oxen, and took a lot more land than Gylfi had intended to give, dragging it out into the Baltic Sea, where it became the isle of Zealand. In 1897, the Danish sculptor Anders Bundgaard began a spectacular statue of Gefjon and her ox-sons, which now sits as part of an elaborate fountain display on the waterfront of Copenhagen, the largest city on Zealand.
