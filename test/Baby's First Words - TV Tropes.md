_"Anyway, Simon and I have this little bet on what her first word will be. Simon thinks it will be 'Dad'. But I know it's going to be 'Mum'. Isn't it, Molly? Mum, mum, mum."_

Unless somebody is mute, there comes a time when everybody says their first word. Sometimes, this is as young as six months, other times it's as old as two, and sometimes even older in people with certain disabilities and (in some, but by no means all cases) with autistic people. But anyway, this trope covers a baby saying their first word in fiction.

Sometimes, the whole plot is about the family trying to get the baby to talk, other times it only takes one scene, and other times, a Flash Back to a character being a baby and saying their first word happens.

When Played for Laughs, common gags include the baby not talking until the parents give up and _then_ they say their first word, the baby's first word being a ridiculously big word for a baby, the first word having to do with something they really like (for example, a Big Eater having "dinner" as their first word), the first word being rude (for example, a swear word, an insult, or a minorly impolite word such as "poop"), the baby's first word stemming from them copying another character's catchphrase, and the baby becoming 100% verbal after saying their first word.

Commonly, the people will be trying to get the baby to say their name or their position in the family (for example the mother trying to get the baby to say "mommy"), and this may lead to arguments between the parents over whether the baby's first word will be "mommy" or "daddy".

If the baby does say "mommy", "daddy" or a person's name as their first word, it might lead to an emotional (as in making you cry happy tears) moment.

If somebody could talk all along but they never do up until now, that's Suddenly Speaking. If they become verbal extremely fast, it's a good bet they're a Brainy Baby. Can overlap with Early Personality Signs.

-   _Gakuen Babysitters_: At the end of Usaida's Sick Episode, the infant Midori — who so far could only incoherently babble — pulls on his pants and exclaims "Udda!" twice; the shocked Ryuuichi wonders whether or not that was her attempting to say Usaida's name. Midori's mother's reaction after being informed that her daughter spoke the name of her **babysitter** instead of, say, either "Mama" or "Papa" is to pout in frustration while grudgingly telling Usaida that it's probably unfair to blame him for this coincidence.

    -   In "At the Movies", the first word Tommy ever said to the adults was "Reptar" to try to tell them that he wanted to see a _Reptar_ movie after seeing a commercial for it on television. This gets a Call-Back in a later episode, "Incident in Aisle Seven", when Tommy sees a commercial for Reptar Cereal, and he tries to tell the adults that the wants some. Stu believes that Tommy is saying "Rip-roar", and Didi believes that Tommy is saying "Riffraff".

    -   In _Rugrats in Paris: The Movie_, the first word Chuckie ever said to the adults was "No!" in an effort to keep Chas from marrying Coco LaBouche. In post-_Rugrats in Paris_ episodes, "No" is the only word Chuckie ever says to the adults, regardless of whether or not it makes sense in that context.
-   An episode of _The Simpsons_, "Lisa's First Word" was all about this, as Homer and Marge told the stories of Bart's & Lisa's first words while awaiting Maggie's.
