"You can't imagine what I pay for contacts."

_At the same time, the thrones are big many-eyed orb-like things. That have flashy lights. So God rides a chariot made entirely out of multi-eyed flashing orb creatures that are actually angels. I can't help but feel that God would totally win a low-rider contest._

Most people only have two eyes. This is generally considered a good thing — it's part of bilateral symmetry, those elements of nature that make sure you only have two arms and two legs. However, if somebody has _three or more_ eyes, well... you want to avoid those people. Sometimes they're harmless but freaky, other times they're actively evil, and occasionally they represent spiritual enlightenment. Sometimes opening a "third eye" shows a level of Psychic Powers, but sometimes a creature will have many eyes so it can _freak you the fuck out_.

Having some Extra Eyes can become Nightmare Fuel if done right or Nightmare Retardant if done with Special Effects Failure (although if done wrong, it can still be freaky).

Contrast Eyeless Face, where it's the _lack_ of eyes that's freaky, or Cyclops, for a creature with a single eye. A Sister Trope to Eyes Do Not Belong There, as the extra eyes have to go somewhere, and not always the usual places. Super-Trope to Third Eye. Also compare and contrast Extra Digits, which is a subtle and not immediately noticeable physical anomaly.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ has quite a few.
    -   Unit-02 has four eyes, two per side. It's worth noting that the green eye-orbs on the sides of the Eva's head are artificial; the Eva's real eyes are on the front of the face, behind a shutter-like apparatus. The Eva permanently loses its upper right eye at the end of Rebuild 2.0 and has a cybernetic replacement in 3.0.
    -   The _Rebuild of Evangelion_ series gave us a number of Evas with an unusual distribution of eyes:
        -   Unit-01 gains a Third Eye on the forehead when it enters its pseudo-evolved form.
        -   Mari's Unit-08 has eight green eyes in a vaguely five-pointed-star formation.
        -   The Mark.09 is initially a Cyber Cyclops of the same head design as Unit-00 but gets decapitated while breaking Shinji out of WILLE's custody. During the finale, it grows a new head that has two rows of red eyes: six in the top row and four in the bottom row for a total of ten eyes.
        -   Unit-13 has four eyes that change coloration depending on the pilots' status: yellow during normal operation, red when Shinji takes exclusive control and Kaworu's death causes the lower pair to fade out. Unlike Unit-01, Unit-13 does not gain an extra eye during pseudo-evolution.
        -   Not really an Eva but the Wunder's bridge is a hollow head of the same design as the Mark.09's new head, with nine eyes in the top row and seven in the bottom row for a total of sixteen eyes.
    -   Lilith's design in the original series had a purple mask with seven eyes. The Mark.06's face without its helmet has the same design but in the Eva's case, the eyes appear to be real.
-   Hiei of _YuYu Hakusho_, especially in his demon form, which has eyes sprouting all over his body. In _Yu Yu Hakusho Abridged_, Yusuke lampshades how being covered in eyes is a bad idea.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_:
    -   Tenshinhan has three eyes, which according to Word of God comes from having distant alien ancestry.
    -   A more alien example would be Guldo of the Ginyu Force, who has four eyes: two on his face, and two larger eyes on the sides of his head. Hence, he's the only member of his team who doesn't wear a scouter.
-   Garyu of _Lyrical Nanoha_, who has four eyes. Also, Sein, who has a third eye built into her right index finger, so that she can see where she is going when she passes through solid objects.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ has a monster called Thousand-Eyes Restrict. It has, well, a thousand eyes, each of which has tremendous hypnotizing potential. Yami must blind all of them simultaneously if he's to have any chance of winning. And he does, of course. By using a combination of Kuriboh and the Magic Card Multiply. Who says that little fluff ball's useless?
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_ has a good example of it with Yubel which is justified by her being a (In Japan hermaphroditic) demon at the time. In the flashback when she was human she had 2 eyes.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_ also has the Hundred Eye Dragon, which is easy enough to describe.
    -   Infernity Death Dragon also has a ludicrous number of eyes, but at least they're all on its _head_.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V_ has Raid Raptors - Rise Falcon, a mechanical falcon with six red eyes that light up ominously on its head.
-   In _Hellsing_, Alucard's hellhound familiar/transformation is basically an amorphous dog-like mass of eyes and shadows. Alucard himself also has a number of eyes that appear on his body sometimes when he is released.
-   The long running manga series _3×3 Eyes_ revolves around this trope.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist_, Envy's true form has extra _everything_, but the creepiest are the many, many eyes which can be found, among other places, on his tongue and gums, and _in the corners of his eyes_, like frogs' eggs.
    -   Also Pride and Father's true forms...
-   Kishin Asura, the Big Bad of _Soul Eater_, has black hair patterned with white to look like eyes, has a third eye on his forehead, and has another pair of eyes where his pupils should be.
    -   He also has eye markings on the back of his hands, and on the skin scarves that cover his head sometimes.
-   Wisely from _D.Gray-Man_ has five eyes; the three on his forehead can read minds.
-   Zommari Le Roux, Espada #7 of _Bleach_ fame, has many extra eyes in his power-up form. Initially, it's stated(by his opponent) that he only has fifty, but after guarding against the attack said opponent was using on him, he reveals a couple more eyes hidden in slits in his forehead.
    -   And on the subject of _Bleach_, there's his boss, Aizen. The final forms that he changed into as the Hougyouku ascended him had lots of eyes.
-   _MÄR_'s Chimera has multiple eyes hidden under her bangs.
-   Some aliens in _Space Adventure Cobra_ are four-eyed humanoids. Most notably Dan Brad in the "Rug-ball" story arc, the captain of the rival team. He proves to be a Worthy Opponent in the end.
-   In _Haré+Guu_, Guu<small>◊</small> sports these once or twice.
-   _Digimon_:
    -   In _Digimon Tamers_, all of the Four Holy Beasts/Sovereigns have four eyes. Xuanwumon/Ebonwumon pulls this off by having two heads. There's also Beelzebumon from that season (and from _Fusion_), who has three eyes.
    -   _Digimon Frontier_ introduces us to Duskmon, the corrupted Human Spirit of Darkness, who has _nine_ eyes (only two are on his face), and Sefirotmon/Sakkakumon, who is basically made of eyes.
    -   Shademon from the _Digimon Xros Wars_ manga is a vaguely-animalistic mass of shadow and eyes that possesses people.
    -   In _Digimon Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Who Leapt Through Time_, Quartzmon's humanoid section has six eyes on its face, which also appears on the tiny cube that is its core.
    -   Charismon from _Digimon Universe: App Monsters_ has eyes all over his armor, from which he deploys his (also eyeball-themed) drones for both Sinister Surveillance, laser-y death, and defensive barriers.
    -   Eyesmon from _Digimon Adventure: (2020)_ is basically a serpentine Living Shadow covered in eyes, with the ones on its head capable of doing Duskmon-style Beam Spams. Its final form, Nidhoggmon, is a city-sized serpentine abomination also covered in eyes, including on its tongue. NeoDevimon also has six eyes in place of a normal face.
-   The Abh from _Crest of the Stars_ have this as one of their more overlooked differences from non-modified humans. All (genetic) Abh have a diamond shaped compound eye in the middle of their foreheads. Most of the time on screen it is covered by some sort of head gear which is used to connect to computer systems as part of their Unusual User Interface.
-   _Monster Musume_: Rachnera the arachne has three sets of eyes on her face.

-   _Sgt. Frog_:
    -   Gyororo, with a total count of 7! And... they also shoot lasers... for some reason...
    -   Nevula (Alisa's "Daddy") can open multiple eyes at random but usually just looks at the world through one.
-   Fafnir in _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_ has four eyes in his dragon form, which is probably supposed to be a Visual Pun on the fact that he wears glasses in his human form.

    Films — Animation 

-   Cobra Commander in _G.I. Joe: The Movie_, as the result of an experiment gone horribly wrong.

    Literature 

-   _Cakes in Space_: The Poglites, as well as quite a few of the cake monsters, have plenty of eyes.

    -   Twoflower was accidentally portrayed as having four eyes on the cover of _The Colour of Magic_ when artist Josh Kirby took the book's description of Twoflower's glasses a bit too literally.

        -   Don't call me soap! \*ZAP!\*

-   Seen in several alien species in the _Perry Rhodan_ universe. This is usually little more than descriptive detail, but becomes a plot point in one issue during the "Second Empire" arc when disguised human agents on a hostile planet give themselves away and get captured because the locals literally have two extra eyes in the backs of their heads while the agents, despite their masks, can still only see in one direction. (The first to inadvertantly tip an alien off does so simply by _turning around to address him_.)

The Other Wiki's description of it is awesome: "Under the influence of science fiction, Rob fears that a walnut will steal his imagination and his thumbs. Danny Thomas guest-stars."
-   One of the critters on a Discovery Channel program about hypothetical alien lifeforms has four eyes: one pair for vision on the always-dark side of its planet, the other pair for use on its ever-lit side.

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Classic series Silurians have a third eye in the middle of their forehead which gives them psychic powers.

-   _Power Rangers_/_Super Sentai_:
    -   Shuten/Retinax of _Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger_/_Power Rangers Wild Force_, has eyes all over his body.

-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: At the end of "Will The Real Martian Please Stand Up?", one of the characters proves that he's an alien by taking off his cap and revealing the third eye in the middle of his forehead.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1985)_: In "The Uncle Devil Show", Joey uses the magic that he learns from the _Tim Ferret and Friends_ video to give his pet poodle Ben four eyes.

    Music 

-   The Misfits' "20 Eyes" is all about this trope.

    Music Videos 

-   A great deal of Tool's music videos are a fan of this.

    Myths & Religion 

-   This trope is Older Than Feudalism with Argos Panoptes, or Argos All-eyes, a giant in Greek mythology who had four eyes (or two faces) in early versions of his myth, and 100 eyes all over his body in later stories. It is said that he was the one who killed Echidna, the monster who gave birth to nearly every other monster in Greek mythology and later on was tasked by Hera to guard Io (who she had turned into a white cow) from her philandering husband Zeus and as such was slain by Hermes. Afterwards, Hera used his countless eyes to make the pattern on the peacock's tail.
-   Descriptions of Angels in _The Bible_ portray them as having multiple eyes, wings, and heads (and many combinations thereof). Since most of these are in either the symbol-heavy apocalyptic genre (Revelations) or the prophetic visions (Ezekiel), they are probably not meant to be taken literally.
-   Indra. When it came to horndoggery, he was at par with Zeus. It was a bad idea to screw over Sage Gautama (or more precise, his wife) and an even worse one to get caught in flagranti. The sage cursed him with a thousand...let's keep it at that it were only eyes after Brahma put in a good word for Indra.

    Pinballs 

-   Many of the aliens in _Big Bang Bar_ either have extra eyes or just one.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Beholders have one large central eye and ten smaller ones on eyestalks. With a busload of subspecies and related creatures, even more in the _Spelljammer_ setting. And in most it's far from a decorative feature.
    -   The gibbering mouther is a monster that's essentially a gelatinous mass covered with eyes and constantly jabbering mouths. In some editions, they gain an eye every time they eat a victim.
    -   This is also the form of Moander, god of decay, who appears as a pile of rotting stuff swarming with stalks-tentacles ending with eyes, mouths and whole bodies it absorbed.
    -   The umber hulk (think a hybrid of a stag beetle and a gorilla) has four eyes, two of which can cause confusion in an observer. The 1st Edition _Monster Manual_ artwork actually played this off well, portraying the creature in such a way that the viewer's attention repeatedly moves from its insectile outer pair of eyes to its human-like inner pair, switching back and forth in a vain attempt to "meet its gaze". Confusion, indeed, much like an optical illusion.
    -   The _Book of Vile Darkness_ contains a spell that blocks a corridor by summoning a shifting wall of eyeballs. Not only is it hard to get through but anyone who gets too close will be sucked in and turned liquid, his eyes added to the wall.
    -   In 3.5th edition, there exists a group of magic 'items' called grafts. These are generally organic things which can be pernamently added to a character's body to give some bonus or new ability. There's a whole slew of eye-based grafts, courtesy of Beholder Cultists.
    -   Aboleths have three eyes which, unusually, are all aligned vertically.
    -   Father Llymic has three eyes in a horizontal row, which is also the only consistent physical trait that his brood shares.
-   _In Nomine_: Seraphim and their Evil Counterparts Balseraphs appear as six-eyed winged serpents in their true forms.
-   _Pathfinder_: While there are exceptions, art of fungus leshys usually depicts them with multiple eyes scattered across their faces.
-   _Vampire: The Masquerade_ has the Salubri, a vampire clan whose biggest distinguishing feature is the third eye on their forehead. Due to the diablerie of their clan's founder Saulot by Tremere and the long campaign of demonization they suffered, they're nearly extinct, with very few modern Kindred being part of the clan, and most being in hiding.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: The growth of additional eyes is a very common Chaos mutation. Of particular note are the Navis Nobilite, who are a sanctioned noble caste of stable mutants whose forehead-mounted third eye allows them to see, understand and navigate the Warp. Its other properties are unclear, but it's been stated by at least one author that looking into it will send normal men mad, and by others that it's an outright One-Hit Kill.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy_: After millennia of worshipping the Spider God and exposing themselves to the toxins of countless spider species, some Forest Goblins have developed... unusual traits. The Goblin Great Shaman model attached to the Catchweb Spidershrine mount in 8th Edition, for instance, has three pairs of eyes stacked vertically, mimicking the spiders that he worships.

    Theme Parks 

-   On the Green Planet in _E.T. Adventure_ at Universal Studios, some of the aliens have multiple eyes completely surrounding their heads.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_, for all its crazy-looking characters, doesn't have many examples to offer. There is Kalmah, the squid\-inspired Barraki warlord, who has a third eye on his forehead. Though he can't use it, as Pridak blinded it by _stabbing it to the point of not working anymore_ in a dispute.

-   _City of Heroes_ has a Third Eye option for faces, as well as one option with what appears to be four alien eyes on each side of the face.
-   Boobus Tuber, an enemy in _Commander Keen_, has multiple eyes. This is fitting, since he's a potato.
-   In _Dark Souls_, the Channeler enemy has six eyes across three rows.
-   Subverted with Q-Bee in the _Darkstalkers_ series. The two eyes on top of her head are in fact her only eyes. The ones in the "normal" place on her face are fakes. That's why she always has her head bowed.

    -   Protheans/Collectors also have four eyes, but they have two eyes on each side of their head, forming a horizontal line of four. Their eyes appear to be able to move independently of one another. A Prothean who'd been in suspended animation for a _very_ long time asks "How do you see with only two eyes?"

While some of them have one or two eyes (who appear as Cannon Fodder and mech/saucer pilots, respectively), three-eyed 'Noids are tough ground troops, and four-eyed 'Noids are even _tougher_ and are implied to be field commanders. Finally, there's the Big Momma Tyhrranoid, who has _nine_ eyes.
-   There are a few Pokémon with additional hidden eyes where you might not have expected them to be:

    -   Subverted with Meowstic, Pokémon based on the Scottish Fold breed of housecats. Meowstic's ears are normally folded, but they can open up to reveal what appears to be more eyes, but the truth may be even freakier in that they are actually extra _brains_.
    -   Exaggerated with Stakataka: It resembles a crude brick building, and every single brick it's made of has a glowing blue eye of its own. Most of them are merely facing inward, though more of them will turn around to face out whenever it attacks.
    -   Mr. Rime looks innocent enough, but he has an extra pair of eyes on his torso. Their expression is synchronized with Mr. Rime's normal eyes.

-   _Touhou Project_:
    -   Yukari Yakumo can open dimensional gaps which are typically full of eyes.
    -   In _Subterranean Animism_, three of the characters have a third eye on their chest. Two of them (Satori and Koishi Komeiji) have theirs on their external hearts and have psychic powers because of it. Satori plays the trope straight, as her eye is open and allows her to read thoughts. Koishi subverts it, as she permanently CLOSED her eye, because A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Read and reading it makes people hate you, in the process shutting down her own feelings and thoughts, but this in turn allows her to manipulate people's subconscious. The third one, Utsuho Reiuji, has a massive eye à la Sauron in her chest, but it seems to be either decorative or a reactor.
-   In _Where in Space Is Carmen Sandiego?_, suspects can have zero, one, two, or many eyes.

    -   One microbe Thaddeus meets while shrunken has several eyes and wants even more.
-   _Ruby Quest_ gives us the three-eyed title character and a Lovecraftian version of Tom Nook. Sure, the latter doesn't have eyes _on his face_...
-   _Schlock Mercenary_: While having multiple eyes is not a medical concern for Sergeant Schlock's species (they grow them on trees), the chain of events that leads to him acquiring them reaches a quite unnerving climax in the emotional confusion of this strip. All sorts of fun things happen to these eyes before the status quo returns. And no, this is not Status Quo Is God - the acquisition of the two extra eyes and the losses of the same in two separate incidents are _all_ associated with climactic awesomeness.

On the flip side, Chromastone, Ghostfreak, Feedback, Nanomech, Upgrade and Wildvine only have one (though Nanomech has four in _Omniverse_), and Wildmutt doesn't have any. Max's old friend Xylene has three. Exaggerated with the aptly-named Eye Guy, who has eyes everywhere on his body except his face.

-   Played With in the episode "Chalkboard Bungle" of _Animaniacs_. At one point, the Warners keep goofing off whenever Miss Flamiel turns her head. She eventually tells them that she has eyes in the back of her head. "Really?" replies Yakko. "So do we." All three twist their bodies around to show that Dot and Yakko each have a pair of eyes on the back of their heads (meaning that they would have four eyes total), while Wakko has a whole mess of eyes.

-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_: Tom, Star's demon ex-boyfriend, has a third eye in the middle of his forehead.
