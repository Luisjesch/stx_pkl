_"You cannot shake hands with a clenched fist."_

— **Indira Gandhi**, Prime Minister of India

Knuckle Cracking happens when a character cracks their knuckles to show that they are ready to deal out a whuppin' or tackle a challenge. Frequently used as an intimidation tactic in fights, this is a particularly effective way of showing that The Stoic is bothered enough by someone to get serious. Cracking knuckles may also be sign that a character is ready to get to work on a particularly arduous task, especially one that requires a lot of muscle. Comes in two varieties: raising one's hands and proceeding to use hand A to fold the fingers of hand B in towards hand B's palm, and then immediately using hand B to do the same with hand A. Another kind involves cracking both hands at once by lacing the fingers together a la Finger-Tenting and bending them away from the palms, pushing one's hands either down towards the ground, forward away from your chest, or some angle in between, such that one's arms take on a wishbone shape. A less common variant, sometimes seen in martial arts films, involves cracking the knuckles one-handed by slowly and dramatically clenching one's hand into a fist.

Sometimes the knuckle cracking sound is removed, maybe for the sake of realism, maybe because some people find it too squicky and then it will be replaced by the hero crushing something in their hand. Bonus points if it's made out of metal, points removed if it's only a paper note.

Sometimes other joints are cracked as well, most often in the neck. Cracking joints in the shoulders or back provides a convenient excuse to flex your muscles and show off your powerful physique. Another reason for this is to flex the muscles, loosen the joints, and open the blood vessels which helps to improve blood-flow and reduce the strain and potential damage from overexerting a stiff body part.

A Sub-Trope of Kinetic Clicking. Compare and contrast with \*Crack!\* "Oh, My Back!", in which a character's joints crack painfully, often to show that they are aging or have an injury.

Since Ryōga constantly does things like lifting immense boulders and smashing walls by banging his head against them in frustration, this isn't surprising
    -   Ranma is pretty fond of the "cracking knuckles and popping joints to show he's getting serious" version, and much like Inu-Yasha he favors the "cracking fingerjoints with an open fist" method. Also, in at least the anime version of Hinako's arrival, he effortlessly bends a yen coin completely in half after taking it from her. Between _thumb_ and _forefinger_.

-   _The Palaververse_: At the end of _Wedding March_, a photo op:
    
    “All those curious ponies and journalists and clicking cameras as well. I reckon we’ll come out well in that one they got us both to pose for.”  
    “You cracking your knuckles, me brandishing the sabre, both of us looking battle-hardened and swashbuckly as we ever were?”
    
-   _Rise of the Minisukas_:

Upon hearing that, Sakura narrows her eyes towards Kiba and walks closer to him while cracking her knuckles before hurting him in a way that he makes a loud howl of pain that various animals could hear from afar.
    -   In the omake from Chapter 62, Kanji asks why the word 'kunoichi' is a thing. Tenten makes a passionate speech about why that word is a thing and how proud she is to wear that title. However, while grinning, Kanji asks why not using the other word, which is _she_\-nobi. Tenten is in disbelief that he asked that question just to make that pun. Soon after, she has some killing intent towards the boy, approaches him slowly, and cracks her knuckles before asking in a soft voice if he thinks everything she just said was a joke. The next paragraph indicates that Kanji now has a comically-large bump on his head that causes him pain.
    -   Anko does this three times in Chapter 72:
        -   The first time is when she warns Naruto and Fū not to pull any prank on her or else they'll regret it.
        -   The second time is before she manages to scare two civilians who were negatively talking about Fū.
        -   The third time is before she does some one-on-one sparring with Fū.

    -   During the ROOT arc, when Jiraiya asks if brute force would work against the wall preventing him and his group from pursuing Danzō, Tsunade walks towards the wall while cracking her knuckles, only stopping when Hiruzen says that he doesn't recall any case where brute force would work and that Tobirama designed the wall to be as impenetrable as possible.

    Films — Animation 

-   Before their bot fight in _Big Hero 6_, Yama cracks his neck with his hands. Hiro tries to imitate him, making a cracking sound effect vocally.

-   North cracks his knuckles just before he confronts Jack Frost about his "center" in _Rise of the Guardians_.
-   In _Turning Red_, Mei cracks her knuckles while Ming cracks her neck as they prepare to clean the temple.
-   Another example of "character who has no bones and is therefore invincible but shows being invincible by cracking his neck despite having no bones after being beaten up" is in _Ultimate Avengers 2_, when the alien Nazi shapeshifter (who is kind of a colony of slugs) does this after falling from a great height.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Random Task in _Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery_ does this. Largely as a parody of Odd Job from _Goldfinger_, the ultimate Stoic.
-   _Blade II_: After drinking his fill of blood and rejuvenating, Blade gives his neck and knuckles a nice crack while limbering up to tear through a small army of Faceless Goons.
-   In _The Dark Knight_, when the Joker is captured, and taunting the cop assigned to watch him, he finally gets a rise out of the guard, who tells him "I know you're gonna enjoy this. I'm just gonna have to enjoy it even more." The Joker's only response is to stoically crack his neck.
-   At the end of _Kick-Ass_, 11 year old Mindy McCready aka Hit Girl is going to school for the first time, when two older kids try to shake her down for her lunch money. Cue Hit Girl cracking her knuckles with an evil smile, then the camera pans away as we hear the bullies screaming in pain.
-   _Kung Fu Hustle_ uses it as a parody of/homage to (it's hard to tell which with Stephen Chow) Bruce Lee, when the Landlady menaces Brother Sum with knuckle-cracking to warn him away from Pig Sty Alley.
-   Bruce Lee likes this one:
    -   An old standard of Kung Fu movies is to have a group from a rival school (often Japanese) come in and start disrespecting the Hero's school and his recently deceased master, maybe making a pass at his girlfriend. _Fist of Fury_, which uses the Chin Woo school as a basis, has a scene where this occurs and we get Lee standing there, taking the insults but with a knuckle crack to show how angry he is getting and to step up the tension.
    -   On the flip side, an example of the "cool" variety, before his fight with Chuck Norris at the Colosseum in _Way of the Dragon_, both fighters step up to each other take off their shirts and then turn around to warm up. Norris only does some knuckle cracking before starting on some karate moves but Lee goes on to crack his entire upper body and show off his muscular definition.
-   In _The Great Outdoors_, Chet does this at the beginning before proceeding with The Art of Bra Removal in a frisky scene with his wife. This precedes the two of them getting caught in said awkward situation by his brother Roman and their family.
-   Agent Smith cracks his neck a lot in _The Matrix_ films.
    -   He cracks his knuckles _and_ his neck during the subway fight in the first movie.
    -   As the Agent Smiths start to wander off at the end of the Burly Brawl in the second movie, several of them crack their necks as an ensemble.
-   _Men in Black_. After the Bug kills Edgar, dons his new Edgar suit and climbs out of the hole made by his crashing starship, he cracks his neck.
-   _Mortal Kombat_
    -   Subverted with some random mook in the first movie, right before he promptly got owned by Sub-Zero.
    -   Played straight in _Mortal Kombat: Annihilation_. Perhaps a little _too_ straight. Shao Kahn must have a really bad neck, because he barely moves his head and it still cracks.
-   _My Demon Lover_, a film where Nick from _Family Ties_ turns into The Devil whenever he gets an erection, has the, er... "hero" going nuts over a misplaced pack of Fritos followed by some gut-wrenching knuckle cracking.
-   In _Pacific Rim_, Raleigh and Mako have Gypsy do this before a major fight. Presumably, the pilots themselves are limbering up for the fight and the jaeger is merely matching their movements. Moments like these help remind the viewer of the humanity living within the giant mecha.
-   _Resident Evil (2002)_. After she succumbs to the T-virus infection and turns into a zombie, Rain Ocampo does the neck cracking variant just before she attacks.
-   In _The Sandlot_, Benny cracks his knuckles (_one handed_) when he faces off with The Beast.

-   In _Snatch._, "One-Punch" Mickey stretches and cracks his knuckles to warm up for a fight _while_ his opponent his pounding on him.
-   Ted Brooks from _Snow Dogs_ tends to do the neck cracking variant. As does his biological father Thunder Jack. At one point, even Nana the Border Collie does it.
-   _Undercover Brother_: After killing three guards with his bare hands, Lance does a neck crack.
-   In the _X-Men Film Series_, it appears a side effect of mutant healing factors is mutant joint-cracking, with Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike really going at this trope for all it's worth. Deathstrike really crunches those fingers of hers. Of course, they don't have to worry about arthritis. Justified in Deathstrike's case, since her claws are inside her fingers. They need to be kept loose, and are probably sore quite often. Bonus points for adding a metal clanking noise when they crack their knuckles, hinting at their adamantium skeletons.

    Literature 

-   _Discworld_:
    -   In both _Soul Music_ and _Maskerade_, the Librarian cracks his knuckles before he begins playing the organ, which the narrator notes takes a while when you have as many knuckles as an orang-utan.

        He cracked his knuckles. There was an echo.
        
-   Uncle Andrew does this in _The Magician's Nephew_, when he's cornered the children in his attic room. Interestingly, he doesn't show any inclination to start a (physical) fight; the cracking seems to have been designed to make him more intimidating (and generally creepy).
-   Variation in _Titus Groan_, in which Flay is constantly followed around by a leitmotif of joint-cracking, and his Let's Get Dangerous! scene involves him wrapping his knees in bandages to allow him to sneak up on his enemy without his skeleton betraying him.

Then it becomes an Overly Long Gag when Urkel, Richie _and_ 3J all become literal Bruce Lee Clone and begin cracking and whining noises.
-   _The Flash (2014)_. Subverted when Felicity Smoak tries this while bragging about her Hollywood Hacking skills.

-   In _Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain_ Venom Snake can "Knock" by twisting his prosthetic wrist around, causing it to crack loudly and spark, drawing attention towards his location.

-   In _ULTRAKILL_, V2 does this before his boss fight in Greed in Act 2. V2 shouldn't even _have_ crackable knuckles, what with him being a Killer Robot with a self-made arm, but It's Personal and he's got a slight flair for the dramatic.
-   _Warframe_ has Lavos, who cracks his knuckles as part of his Idle Animation. Curiously, he's not a brawler by design.

-   The Bull from _Tower of God_ gave us a loud and muffled example of neck cracking.
-   _Van Von Hunter_ sort of plays with this trope; the signature move of the Flaming Prince is saying "I will CRUSH you like this \[noun\]!" while acting this out. Often said object is something he really does not want to crush, due to it being valuable or very painful.

    Web Original
