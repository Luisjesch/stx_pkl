_"Th-th-th-th-that's all, folks!"_

An element that appears at the conclusion of every episode, chapter, or Story Arc. It can be dialogue, narration, or Paratext. Either way, it informs the audience that the episode/arc is over, without resorting to a generic "The End" or "To Be Continued..." title card.

For some viewers, On the Next and Closing Credits tend to function like this (even though that's probably not the intent of the creators). Oh, Cisco! is the variation that ends every ep with a joke, which may lead to everybody laughing. May include a catchphrase.

A Sub-Trope to Once per Episode and Super-Trope to So Once Again, the Day Is Saved. Shows, especially aimed at young children, often end with a Wrap-Up Song. See also Signing-Off Catchphrase.

-   CBS's Saturday morning block in 1987:
    
    "That's a wrap!" (...right here on CBS! \[Yeah!\])
    
    -   A similar version was used during the following season:
    
    "See you next Saturday!" (...here on CBS! \[Yeah!\]) "That's a wrap!"
    
-   PBS Kids block in the 1990's:
    
    **P-Pals:** (singing) This is, PBS! Woo-hoo-hoo! (P-Pet barks)
    

    Anime & Manga 

-   Many anime shows have the ending theme start to Fade In during the last scene.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_. The only exception is one episode in which Maes Hughes dies; this episode ends with his funeral and the credits roll under the minimal brass and drum stings that open the Amestris leitmotif.

-   _Black Lagoon_, except for episode 15, which changed the ending theme to "The World of Midnight."

-   _My-HiME_ and _My-Otome_, except for the endings of the two major Story Arcs in each.
-   _Fushigi Yuugi_. When Nuriko dies, however, his character song "Kaze no Uta" is used.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_ and its sequel series _Destiny_.

-   _City Hunter_ ends on a stylized freeze frame of City Hunter (and the client sometimes) with the music coming up.

-   The _Mahou Tsukai Tai!_ OAVs. Anime _really_ likes doing this.

-   _Mushishi_. With a _different song every episode_.
-   _Kodocha_ starts the ending theme at the beginning of whatever revelation or confrontation the episode will end on. Many fans have made a game of seeing who can predict exactly when the music will start.

-   From _Space Battleship Yamato_: "Hurry Star Force<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , there are only\_\_\_days left to save the Earth..."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Kamen no Maid Guy_ has the countdown to Naeka's birthday.
-   Episodes of _Cowboy Bebop_ ended with a small text slogan on a black background; most episodes ended with "See You Space Cowboy..." Certain episodes that were dramatically significant ended differently, usually with a line that indirectly related to the character development that had occurred. "You're Gonna Carry That Weight" was used at the close of the final episode after Spike and Vicious (possibly) kill each other.
    -   The best subversion was in the episode with Andy, a literal Space Cowboy. At the end of the episode, after he's been defeated, he shows up again, now a samurai. Sure enough, the ending says "See you Space Samurai..."
-   _The Big O_ ended with a black-and-white text card, reading either "We Have Come To Terms" or "No Side," depending on the results of the negotiations in the episode, or "To Be Continued" for a multi-part story. The holiday episode used "Merry Christmas" instead.
    -   Interestingly, Season 2 was a completely uninterrupted string of "To Be Continued"'s all the way to the last episode of the season (and thus, the series). The very last frame of the show finally gives us "We Have Come To Terms" (yeah, sure, I guess you can call it that, show).
-   _UFO Baby_ has Wannya writing on his electronic diary.
-   _Almost_ entirely done in _Code Geass_, as virtually every episode of both seasons ends with some form of a cliffhanger (and on top of that, a decent percentage of the cliffhangers involve screwing over/complicating the protagonist's plans in some way).
-   Every episode of _Hamtaro_ would end with Laura saying that it had been a great day, that the next day would be even better, and Hamtaro squeaking in agreement.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_ does the "To Be Continued..." sign at the end of every episode on the corner of the screen. The narrator, at least dub-wise, always says some sort of speech relating with the last scene to overlap with this.
    -   Actually, this is a somewhat-regular occurrence in anime (and other Japanese TV shows as well) with continuing stories (i.e., it doesn't always happen). Each episode until the finale will say "Tsuzuku" (which means "To Be Continued). Once a show reaches the final episode, it will then say "Owari" ("\[The\] End").
    -   A variation of the above occurs in _One Piece_. The first two episodes had "TSUZUKU" in a large font. All episodes thereafter say "TO BE CONTINUED" in English with big letters.
-   Every episode of _Transformers: Super-God Masterforce_ ended with the narrator exclaiming "Now, you too use the Masterforce to TRANSFORM!"
-   In _Hidamari Sketch_, Yuno (or any character who's the center of the episode's story from the second season) got a Furo Scene reflecting that episode's events at the end of each episode.
-   _Harukanaru Toki no Naka de - Hachiyou Shou_ not only has the Ending Theme fade-in thing, but also uses the time between the start of the fade-in and the start of the actual ending sequence to put on the screen a _tanka_ poem that somewhat reflects the events of the episode. This effect doesn't change even when the default ending song gets replaced in some of the character-centered episodes; the only time it gets altered is the series' finale, where the ending song plays over the next-to-the-last scene, and the poem appears at the very end of the episode.
-   _The Tatami Galaxy_ features a sequence at the end of every episode except the final one to signify the continuation of the "Groundhog Day" Loop by having the main clock of Watashi's university rewinding and the events of the episode flashing by, to be immediately followed by the ending theme.
-   About every short episode of _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ ends with "To be continued... maybe".
-   Each episode of the _Non Non Biyori_ anime, with the exception of the last of each season, ends with two of the main cast standing between "That's all for today" and bowing towards the screen.
-   At the end of the majority of episodes in _Kirby: Right Back at Ya!_, a star-shaped closing iris pans in onto Kirby, who is usually doing a happy pose. There is also a tune that plays with it.
    -   Later episodes add a short skit afterwards, which is a few seconds long and changes every episode. These are removed in the dub.
-   The many iterations of the beloved anime/manga _Tensai Bakabon_ usually ends its segment with Papa turning to the camera and saying “koredeiinoda!” Or, “it’s going to be alright!” when in a heated situation.
-   _Mahoromatic_ generally has sweet and light-hearted storylines, but there's a tragic undercurrent running through the series which is reinforced at the end of every episode, where we get a title card telling us how many days Mahoro has left to live.
-   In _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_, chapters normally end with the narration giving the results of the current Battle of Wits (plots that span multiple chapters usually save it until the last one). The anime kept this format, though it happens multiple times per episode due to each one adapting several chapters.
-   _Excel♡Saga_ has the "Today's experiment" screen, which almost always reads "Failed", but is occasionally switched up with other grades.
-   When every episode of the _Asteroid in Love_ anime ends, the ending theme usually plays 10-15 seconds before the ending credits start running. In nearly every episode, Mira gives a summary and how she thinks of the episode's events, with the exception of the sixth and tenth episodes, when it's used to deliver a Wham Line and a Wham Shot, respectively.

    Audio Plays 

-   Every audiobook from Audible ends the same way.
    
    _Audible hopes you have enjoyed this program._
    
-   The cassette tape and CD versions of Disneyland Records' book and record read-along sets usually<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  end with this:
    
    "That was the end of the story. If you would like to hear it again, (just) turn the tape over / just put the disc back to track one."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    

    Comic Books 

-   _X-Men_ sometimes has the (X) sigil at the end of an arc to indicate that particular arc has completed.
-   _PS238:_ "Class dismissed!"
-   _Suske en Wiske_: Each album traditionally ends with Wiske winking at the audience.
-   _Nero_: In the color albums almost every album traditionally ends with a waffle feast.
-   _Lucky Luke_ always ends with Lucky Luke driving off into the sunset while he sings _"I'm A Poor Lonesome Cowboy"_. The same about its animated adaptations, _Daisy Town_, _Ballad of the Daltons_ and the _Lucky Luke_ animated series.
-   _Asterix_ always ends with the Gauls having a celebratory feast. And tie and gag Cacofonix while they're at it lest his music ruins the feast. Later on, the Gauls just treat it as tradition. Unless Cacofonix is saving the day, or if one person cannot make the banquet.
    -   In which case, Fulliautomatix, the one who usually handles Cacofonix, is usually the one tied up.
-   Every issue of _Transmetropolitan_ ends with a variant on the three-eyed smiley face that represents the Transient movement.
-   Every issue of _Watchmen_ ends with an epigraph, which quotes the source of each issue's title.
-   "You are now leaving _Astro City_, please drive carefully."
    -   Except for the "Pastoral" issue, which has "Caplinville City Limits - Come Back Soon!"
    -   And in issues that are part of a larger arc, it's "Astro City Department of Public Works - Under Construction."
-   With _very rare_ exceptions, every issue of _Groo the Wanderer_ would end with a Moral.
-   The last panel of each _The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes_ comic has an encircled A in the corner.
-   Early _Captain America_ stories would end with Steve and Bucky back at Camp Lehigh, usually in trouble for neglecting their army duties while off being superheroes.
-   Most stories in _Astro City_ end with a street sign reading "You are now leaving Astro City. Please drive carefully." Issues that are part of a larger arc end with "Astro City Department of Public Works - Under Construction."
    -   Except for "Pastoral", which ends with "Caplinville City Limits - Come Back Soon!"

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Little Nemo_, Nemo wakes and falls out of bed or is woken up by something in the last panel of every page.
-   Each Sunday edition of _Heathcliff_ ends with "Kitty Korner", which talks about something unusual or otherwise interesting that happens to a cat (and sometimes his / her owner). These are usually based on submissions by readers.
-   _Marmaduke_ has it's own version of this (with dogs, of course), called "Dog Gone Funny". It even made it into Ruby-Spears' adaptation (which was part of their Heathcliff series<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ).

    Eastern European Animation 

-   _„Kérem a következőt!”_: All episodes end with Bubó turning towards the camera and telling a Spoof Aesop in the form of a quote from one of his former professors before the iris closes on him.

    Fan Works 

-   In _The Legend of Total Drama Island_, every chapter posted to date except for the prologue ends thusly: "The hour was growing late, so Brett's mother left off her tale and suggested that he prepare for bed."
-   Almost every chapter in _Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles_ ends with the line, "Author's Note: Blessings!" This is sometimes followed by a selection of Bible verses.
-   Each edition of the _Halloween Unspectacular_ anthology series ends with a parody of Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start The Fire", performed by E350, with lyrics reflecting the stories contained in that respective edition. The sole exception is the ninth volume, _This is fine_, which ends with a Downer Ending cliffhanger as the Bus Driver succeeds in destroying E350's life.
-   _The Palaververse_: Each of the main stories ends with Alloy bringing Celestia tea and her wishing Alloy a good night:
    
    **Moonlight Palaver:** “Go on then. You'll want some rest after today. I'll deal with the pot and cup myself.”  
    Alloy found his voice. “Yes, Your Majesty.” He bowed stiffly and turned to depart.  
    “Sleep well,” said Celestia at his back. “The world will keep spinning. It can scarcely do much else.”
    
    **The Tempest:** She rose from her slight slump, snapping out of whatever mood had held her, and turned to smile at Alloy. “Retire for the night, Alloy. Tundra and I shall attend to the tea tray. Sleep well. The world will continue to spin.”  
    Alloy bowed and turned, and he heard Celestia’s soft voice at his back. “I will make sure of it, come what may.”
    
    **Wedding March:** She looked up at Alloy, tired magenta briefly swallowing him up, and she nodded. “Thank you for the tea, Alloy. Do give Burro and Gellert adequate warning tomorrow, if you think they need some sudden, dire distraction from their hangovers. And get a good night’s rest.”  
    Allow swallowed, and nodded. “Yes, Your Majesty.”  
    “The next day shall dawn,” Celestia murmured as he turned to leave. “I … _we_ will all make sure of it.”
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   James Bond movies' endings have evolved since _Dr. No_, but the vast majority (at least pre-reboot) end with a scene of Bond and the Bond Girl together, often with a Double Entendre One-Liner to close out the movie.
    -   Bond movies also nearly always end with the statement during the ending credits: JAMES BOND WILL RETURN.
        -   In the older movies, that statement would include the next movie's name, sometimes incorrectly; _For Your Eyes Only_ was originally supposed to follow _The Spy Who Loved Me_.
    -   In a documentary about the making of _The World Is Not Enough_, the makers commented that "You need an ending that's _like_ 'Bond and the girl escape in a rubber raft while the villain's base blows up', but isn't _actually_ 'Bond and the girl escape in a rubber raft while the villain's base blows up.'"
-   In the Christopher Reeve-era Superman movies, he flies off into space every time.
-   Harry Potter has the last line in every film except for the last one, where he shares an exchange with his son, instead.
-   Every _Scary Movie_ film ends with someone getting hit by a car.

    Folklore 

-   Armenian folk tales almost always end with some variant on the phrase "Three apples fell from heaven; one for the storyteller, one for the listener, and one for whoever pays good attention."

    Literature 

-   Compare the last words from each of the _Wayside School_ books:
    -   _Sideways Stories from Wayside School_: "Everybody booed."
    -   _Wayside School is Falling Down_: "Everybody mooed."
    -   _Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger_: "Everybody oohed."
    -   _Wayside School Beneath the Cloud of Doom_: "Everybody chewed."
-   _Sharpe_ novels usually end with the title of the book, e.g. _Sharpe's Tiger_ ends with "It was Sharpe's tiger."
-   Every book in _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ ends with a letter to the editor (thoroughly detailing where he may find the manuscript of the next book) and a full page illustration which contained a hint about a certain theme within the next book.
-   Standard fairytale ending: "And they \[all\] lived happily ever after \[except for _X_\]."
-   Arabian Nights endings are more restrained "They lived happily until there came to them the One Who Destroys All Happiness." (i.e., death) Sweet dreams, kids!
-   Every _Discworld_ Watch novel ends with Vimes and the Watch being rewarded usually by the Patrician, and often in a way that reflects the changing politics of the books:
    -   Originally, in _Guards! Guards!_, the gag was that the only reward they wanted was a small wage increase, a kettle and a dartboard. (And even then, Sergeant Colon thought they were pushing it.)
    -   _Men at Arms_ starts out the same way, before it turns out that the _reason_ Carrot wants a new kettle is because he plans the Watch's increase to 56 officers (from six), and the reopening of the section houses. Vimes becomes Commander of the Watch and (reluctantly) a knight.
    -   In _Feet of Clay_, the Patrician does a McCloud Speech, saying that since Vimes has upset every Guild leader in the city, his wages will have to be increased again. "And I expect they need a new dart-board in the Watch House? They usually do, I recall."
    -   In _Jingo_, Vimes insists there's _nothing_ the Patrician can offer that will make him accept a Dukedom ("We've got the Watch set up, we've almost got the numbers, the widows and orphans fund is so big the men are queuing up for the dangerous beats, and the dartboard we've got is nearly new!"), before getting caught off-guard by Vetinari's suggestion that the history of Sam's regicidal ancestor might be re-examined. Nobby and Fred, meanwhile, are rewarded by being put in charge of Traffic Control ("A chance to be 'self-financing' and not get shot at.")
    -   Since Vimes is still in Uberwald at the end of _The Fifth Elephant_, it's Rhys Rhysson, Low King of the dwarfs who rewards the Watch for their aid. This includes the very political aknowledgement of Cheery (an openly female dwarf) and Detritus (a troll) as friends of the Low King. Vimes is given a dwarfish battle-axe, an ironic thing for a king to give a Vimes.
    -   At the end of _Night Watch_, Vetinari suggests commemorating the Watchmen who died on the 25th of May, but Vimes shoots this down. He reiterates there's nothing he wants ("We don't even need a new bloody dartboard!"), but the Patrician again catches him off-guard, this time by re-opening the Treacle Mine Road Watch House.
    -   _Thud!_ ends with Vimes in Uberwald again. Sybil says that Vetinari would be wondering how to reward him, and he replies "He can go on wondering. I've got everything I want." ... leading to an Ironic Echo Cut back to the city, where Carrot is telling the Patrician that "Commander Vimes wouldn't settle for anything less" than sixty new officers to join the Watch.
    -   Played with in _Snuff_; the reward scene comes two thirds of the way through the book, complete with Vimes getting a new title as King of the River for saving _The Wonderful Fanny_. When Vimes and Vetinari have their conversation at the end the Patrician is _not_ in a mood to reward him.
-   _The Riftwar Cycle_: "Ah, Arutha, you take all the fun out of life!"
-   In the epilogues (or prologues) of the books of _A Song of Ice and Fire_ by George R. R. Martin, the P.O.V. character narrating that chapter dies.
-   At the end of every _Clue_ book, Mr. Boddy is supposedly killed.
-   Every book in the _Sweet Valley High_ universe (Twins, High, University, etc), ended with a preview of the next book, as something that may have been hinted at throughout the book's plot (a couple arguing, a person feeling pressured about school/home) now took center stage in the book's final chapter.
-   Every book in the _Captain Underpants_ series ends with George & Harold shouting "Oh no!" and "Here we go again!". Up until the fifth book this was accompanied by Mr. Krupp being turned back into Captain Underpants and running off but since the 6th book it has always been George Harold, and may a few other characters involved in a _Here We Go Again!_ type of ordeal.
-   Every installment of Rosemary Wells's _Voyage to the Bunny Planet_ books ends with the star character of the book observing the Bunny Planet in the night sky and realizing with delight "It was there all along!"
-   The final chapter of each installment of _Lockwood & Co._ (save the one-off short story _The Dagger in the Desk_) opens with a newspaper account summarizing the key case of the book. These accounts, however, usually lack key details that have been deemed by the authorities to be too sensitive for public ears, such as iron magnate John Fairfax being the murderer of Annie Ward in _The Screaming Staircase_, or that the woman the public knows as Penelope Fittes is responsible for the epidemic of ghosts in _The Empty Grave_. These accounts also provide at least some detail as to Lockwood and Co.'s involvement in the cases, though also usually heavily edited. The lone exception is the fourth book, _The Creeping Shadow_, in which their involvement is kept entirely secret in an effort to try to protect them, not that it does much good.
-   Isaac Asimov's "...That Thou Art Mindful of Him": Each chapter is followed by a chapter Na, such as chapter 1a, 4a, and 8a. Each subsection starts with "\[Name\] sat alone", where the name is someone who was in the previous chapter. The last chapter ends with two characters sitting alone.
-   _Redwall_: Many books in the series, especially the later ones, end with a statement to the effect of "The gates of the Abbey are always open to friends."

    Live-Action TV 

-   Before 24-hour TV and radio stations became commonplace (and still used if a station needs goes off the air for something like maintenance), most U.S. TV stations would show a sign-off announcement, the U.S. anthem (or "High Flight" as narrated by William "Cannon" Conrad), a prayer from a local church leader, followed by a test pattern.
-   _Arrested Development_: Every episode ends with fake previews for next week that subvert real teasers that reality tv and dramas often use to build interest.
-   _The Bozo Show_: Every episode ends with _The Grand March_. It's where audience follows Bozo the Clown to the exit.
-   _Welcome Back, Kotter_: Part of a bookend, where each episode began and ended with Kotter telling a joke (usually ending in a bad pun) about one of his relatives.
-   _Superior Court_: The 1980s courtroom drama (promoted as bringing "real people, real cases, real drama" through presentations of fictional cases) always ended each story with a "Where Are They Now"-type epilogue, telling viewers what happened to the principal characters of each case. Sometimes, if a major social issue was involved, the narrator told what happened as the result of said case.
-   _Quantum Leap_ always ended with Sam leaping into a new identity and saying "Oh, boy." The scene would then double as the beginning of next week's show. Most of these scenes contained no connection to the story that had just ended, so that they could be swapped between episodes if the network felt like changing the air order. Some syndication packages have the same ending appended to multiple episodes.
-   In _The Prisoner (1967)_, a photo of Number 6's face rises from a bird's-eye view of the Village. Bars slam shut.
-   _Yes, Minister_ almost always (_Jobs For The Boys_ was an exception) ends with a character, usually Sir Humphrey, saying "Yes, Minister" - in an astonishing variety of different intonations. When the title was changed to _Yes, Prime Minister_...
-   _The Tracey Ullman Show_ always ended with Tracey (in her post-costuming dressing gown) emphatically telling the audience to "Go home!" Homaged at the end of the credits for her HBO series _Tracey Takes On..._.
    
    **Cast and crew:** _\[as Tracey is leaving the soundstage\]_ Good night Trace!  
    **Tracey:** Go home!
    
-   Carol Burnett always tugged on her ear at the end of her shows.
    -   It was a holdover from her days on stage. She did this as a covert way of saying "I love you" to her grandmother.
-   _Knight Rider_ (and probably a lot of 1980s action series) ended with stock footage of the car, and earlier episodes had a narrative epilogue as well.
-   Up until about the start of The '90s, most Sit Coms would end on a freeze frame, with the studio audience applauding the episode.
-   The freeze frame was parodied by _Police Squad!_, where the credits would roll while the principal characters _stand really still_, and everything around them continued moving. (Plus, before each freeze frame scene, Drebin would casually rhyme off every criminal caught in the series to date as part of a conversation.)
-   Quite a few series have the credits music kick in a few seconds before the credits. _Doctor Who_'s electronic "scream" comes to mind.
    -   And _EastEnders_' iconic "Dun-dun, dun, dun, d-d-dun-dun." drumbeats. In fact one episode of _EastEnders_ even had the latter two blended together in one episode; when Bradley and Stacey Branning were at a _Doctor Who_ convention, the "scream" was played as part of the convention 'atmosphere' just before the drumbeats showed up so one segued into the other.
-   _The Waltons_ would end with the family telling each other "good night." Cue the panoramic view of their household and The Stinger.
-   On _The Good Night Show_, the host (either Nina or Melanie) would say goodnight to Hush the Fish and sing "Hey, OK."
-   Most episodes of _Sliders_ ended with the group sliding into the next world. In the earliest episodes, they tried linking one episode to the next with a _Quantum Leap_\-style tag scene, but the tags couldn't be shuffled between episodes because the characters' clothing needed to match. When the network aired a cliffhanger resolution the week _before_ the cliffhanger, the producers gave up.
-   Almost every episode of _Star Trek: The Original Series_ ended with music playing over a shot of the Enterprise sailing through the starfield. This is usually preceded by a bit of banter where Kirk makes a quip about Vulcans, and then Spock retorts with a quip about humans, or vice versa.
    -   Most first season episodes of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ ended with Picard or Riker saying "Engage" and the Enterprise departing to bombastic music. They dropped this later on.
-   _Dragnet_ usually ended with the narrator describing the fate of the accused over a shot of the perp looking uncomfortably at the mugshot camera.
-   _Seinfeld_ ends every episode with a freeze-frame and the show's signature bass-line playing.
-   _Sesame Street_: From Season 1 to Season 45, each show ends with the "sponsor" announcement: "_Sesame Street_ was brought to you today by ..." the featured letter(s) and number. Following this was a listing of corporate sponsors.
    -   From Season 1 through 31, They would also end the show with the phrase _Sesame Street is a production of The Children's Television Workshop._
        -   Starting in Season 46, the sponsor announcement is dropped, and it just goes straight to the credits where the Muppets sing "Smarter, Stronger, Kinder".
-   _The Electric Company (1971)_: The show used two:
    -   During the first season (1971-1972), the last act of each day was the soap opera parody "Love of Chair," followed by "And now, the last word ... " where a word, often having to do with one of the sounds of the day was read.
    -   For the remainder of the series (1972-1977), a "next episode" teaser was played instead ("Next time on _The Electric Company_, the cook says ..." followed by a frozen action shot and a muted "wah-wah"-type sound.) This was omitted on the final episode of each season.
    -   In turn, much like _Sesame Street_, the corporate credits — a listing of corporate sponsors — was played. Before the roll, one of the cast members read the following: "The Electric Company is a production of ... the Children's Television Workshop.")
-   Every episode of _NCIS_ between "Bete Noire" and the season 1 finale ended with the same shot of Gibbs' computer running a photo database ID search attempting to identify the terrorist from "Bete Noire", signifying Gibbs' obsessive quest to find the mysterious terrorist Ari.
-   Every episode of _Mama's Family_ ended with an Establishing Shot of the house, and Mama always spoke the last line, which was always a zinger.
-   Almost every episode of _Boston Legal_ ended with Denny and Allan discussing the episode's Aesop (or lack thereof) over Scotch and cigars on their balcony.
-   _Doogie Howser, M.D._ always ends with Doogie typing in his journal about a lesson he learned from the events of the episode.
-   _The Two Ronnies_ ended with their catchphrase of "It's goodnight from me..." "...and it's goodnight from him."
-   Most _Top Gear_ episodes end with Jeremy Clarkson saying "...and on that bombshell..." or variants thereof, with few exceptions. (Such as when Clarkson was caught and devoured by a pack of hunting dogs.)
-   _Beakman's World_ always ended just like it began: Don and Herb Penguin give an Oh, Cisco!\-type joke, then turn off the teevee.
-   The classic '50s sitcom _The Honeymooners_ almost always ended with Jackie Gleason's saying to his wife "Baby, you're the greatest" followed by a kiss.
-   With the exceptions being the first part of a two-parter (or the first two parts of the series opener when divided into three parts), every episode of the original _Battlestar Galactica_ series ended with a shot of the fleet and Lorne Greene's voiceover describing the premise of the series.
    
    "Fleeing the Cylon tyranny, the last Battlestar, Galactica, leads a ragtag fugitive fleet, on a lonely quest. A shining planet known as Earth."
    
-   Every episode of _The Daily Show_ ends with a "Moment of Zen," which is usually a funny clip pertaining to something mentioned during the show.
-   _Made in Canada_ (generally known elsewhere as _The Industry_) always ended with a character, usually Richard (Rick Mercer), looking at the camera and saying "I think that went well," usually when something has gone terribly wrong for another character. Alternatively, the character for whom something has gone terribly wrong (usually Victor or Alan) will look at the camera and say, "This is not good."
-   Most shows by Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer conclude with a characteristic musical duet (sometimes with changed lyrics to fit the episode). _Vic Reeves Big Night Out_ had "Oh Mr Songwriter," _The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer_ had "I Love the Smell..." and _Shooting Stars_ had a reprise of the opening "Welcome to Shooting Stars."
-   Once every episode of _Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego_ ends, there's only one more thing that needs to be done, AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?! "Do it, Rockapella!"
-   _Roundhouse_ would end every episode with an occasionally random segue into the line "Reprise the theme song, and roll the credits!"
-   _The Red Skelton Show_: "Good night, and may God bless."
-   On _The Red Green Show_, The Possum Lodge meeting is called. Red gives a risqué message to his wife, and then says "On behalf of me and Harold and everyone else here at Possum Lodge... keep your stick on the ice."
-   _Wonder Woman_ ended episodes on a freeze frame of Lynda Carter smiling.
-   _Touched by an Angel_ ended (and began) with a dove flying around the scene. No matter how the scene started. There's even one in a Snow Globe! An exception to the dove was made if the episode focused on non-Christian characters, such as an episode examining a family's conflicting views towards Judaism, although the camera moving up to look towards Heaven was maintained.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_ always ended with an epilogue by series creator Rod Serling concluding with the words "...in the Twilight Zone." or something similar. Serling actually started appearing on screen after the first season finale "A World of His Own", in which the character Gregory West broke the fourth wall to talk to him.
-   Most, but not all episodes of _The Banana Splits Adventure Hour_ ended with a closing skit in which Fleagle would "adjourn" the club meeting; he would usually say "The Banana Splits Club is now officially adjourned," or some other variation.
-   The Mickey Mouse Club: Now it's time to say goodbye to all our company M-I-C... see ya real soon! K-E-Y... Why? Because we like you! M-O-U-S-E.
    -   The '90s version then cuts into an upbeat Dancing Theme.
-   _Johnny Bago_ sends a letter home to his mother, giving her news about his travels...and the Mafia intercepts her mail, so they also know what he's up to.
-   In the sketch show _A Bit of Fry and Laurie_, every episode of the last 2 series ended with Stephen Fry making a bizarre cocktail and serving it up, after instructing Hugh Laurie "Please Mr Music, will you play?" Laurie played the theme tune on the piano (and made trumpet noises with his mouth), and each show concluded with the toast "soupy twist."
-   Frequently occurs on news shows, with the anchor's trademark signoff. Edward R. Murrow's "Good night and good luck," later stolen by Keith Olbermann, who now uses "That's Countdown, on this the \[XXXXth\] day since the previous president declared Mission Accomplished in Iraq. I'm Keith Olbermann, good night and good luck."
    -   As the George W. Bush Presidency started winding down, he'd add, "Congratulations on getting through another day of this crap."
-   _Cold Case_ has this down to a science. Every episode concludes with a sombre montage which is bound to include:
    -   Period music from the same time as the flashback segments of the preceding episode.
    -   Shots of the major characters in the case doing things in the present, as both their "present" and "past" selves.
    -   The case itself being re-filed in the evidence room, with the word "closed" stamped on it.
    -   An apparition of the murder victim (s), seen briefly by one of the detectives (or one of their loved ones) before fading from sight.
-   Many old game shows, especially those produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman, would end with The Announcer signing off for the show over the ending credits, audience applause, and scenes of the winners. For example, "This is Gene Wood speaking for _Family Feud._ A Mark Goodson Television Production." Substitute name of show and announcer's name as needed. (Occasionally this would be accompanied with a short production or legal note, e.g. "The third contestant on today's show was found to be ineligible and his prizes were forfeited.") _The Price Is Right_ is the only show that still does this.
    -   Speaking of _The Price Is Right_, when Bob Barker was the host, he ended every show since the '80s by imploring people to spay or neuter their pets.
-   At the end of _Kenan & Kel_, Kenan would ask Kel to grab three random items, meet him at a random location, and call him a random nickname. Kel would then end the episode with his trademark, "Awwww, here it goes!"
-   Amanda Bynes ended every episode of _The Amanda Show_ by telling the audience, "Well, that's our show. I gotta go \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. See ya!" The blank would always be some bizarre or impossible task, such as "overthrow Canada" or "stir-fry a bikini."
-   _Lost_ consistently ended with the word "LOST" in white over a black screen, but for one notable exception: when Season 5 ended with the explosion of the hydrogen bomb, it was reversed so that "LOST" was written in black over a white screen.
-   _Charmed_: every season ended with a door, mostly that of the Halliwells' house, being telekinetically closed by Prue, by a ghost of a dead Halliwell, like Prue, or just closing.
-   _Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction_: Jonathan Frakes would end each story with a pun.
-   Every episode of the BBC sitcom _The Vicar of Dibley_ (except one) ends with the Vicar telling the verger Alice a joke. Alice usually doesn't get the joke, so the Vicar has to try, unsuccessfully, to explain the punchline. Only one episode does not end with a joke, but in that episode the joke is at the beginning.
-   _Tales Of The Riverbank_ would end with the narrator starting to relate an anecdote...
    
    "But that is _another_ story."
    
-   Nearly every episode of _Mork & Mindy_ ended with Mork's report to Orson. ("Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.") The exceptions are the Christmas Special, the finale of season 3 (which ended with Mork and Mindy confessing their love to one another), and several season 4 episodes.
-   Every episode of _Pee-wee's Playhouse_ ended with Pee-Wee riding on his red motor scooter after flying out of his playhouse. Later episodes showed him wearing a red one-eyed monster helmet, and also had him fly past Mt. Rushmore.
-   _Reading Rainbow_: "\[I'll/We'll\] see ya next time!"
-   Brum the sentient car would always return to the museum, and the curator would discover a memento of his latest adventure in the back seat.
-   In _Mystery Science Theater 3000_, one of the mad scientists would end the show by pushing a button to cut off the transmission. In fact, Dr. Forrester's "Push the button, Frank," became something of a catch phrase. (During season one it was "File this, Larry.") This was dropped when the show moved to Sci-Fi Channel.
    -   After the ending credits there was usually a "stinger", a short bizarre scene or quote from the film they watched that episode.
-   The first few episodes of _The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin_ ended with a despairing scream from Reginald. This was phased out.
-   _Wipeout (2008)_: "Good night...and big balls."
-   "Jesse's got metal to burn and sparks to fly! The next _Monster Garage_ challenge ...is just...around...the bend!"
-   In _Teletubbies_, the Teletubbies say "Bye-bye" when they go back to the Tubbytronic Superdome as the Sun Baby sets.
-   In _The Avengers (1960s)_, Steed and Mrs Peel would depart the area into the distance in whatever conveyance was available or appropriate.
-   _Frasier_ ends with 'Tossed Salads and Scrambled Eggs' being played over a scene.
-   _Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In_ always ended with Dan and Dick saying goodnight (Dan: "Say goodnight, Dick." Dick: "Goodnight, Dick!"), followed by the joke wall, some blackouts then have the sound of one person clapping during the ending graphics and the NBC snake logo.
-   _American Bible Challenge_: "If you don't know your Bible, you don't have a prayer!"
-   Every episode of _The Man Show_ ended with girls jumping on trampolines over the credits.
-   "And the clown jumped over the moon!"
    -   Heyyyyy... WHO MADE THIS BIIIIIG MESS?
-   _Mr. Belvedere_: The titular Mr. Belvedere writing in his journal making observations about his host family.
-   _3rd Rock from the Sun_: The family, sitting on a rooftop, discusses what (they think) they've learned about human civilization.
-   Every episode of _Dong Yi_ will end with a close-up shot of Dong Yi before cutting into the credits.
-   _MacGruber_ sketches end with a cry of "MacGruber!" over a shot of the location exploding.
-   Every episode of _Spooks_ ends with a colour-inverted version of the episode's final shot, before (with the exception of season finales) cutting to the On the Next.
-   Each _Fortysomething_ episode ended with Paul and Estelle going to bed at night.
-   Every episode of _2 Broke Girls_ ends with a counter showing the amount of money the titular characters have saved up to start their cupcake business. It can go up or down depending on what happened in the episode.
-   Most _Cheers_ episodes had an abrupt ending — the last word (typically a Punchline) was immediately followed by a cut to black.
    -   An exception: In one episode, Sam did an old The Three Stooges trick. Saying "come here, porcupine," he grabbed Rebecca's nose between two fingers of his clenched fist, then slapped his fist away. When she told him that hurt, he said it was all in fun like with the Stooges. She immediately repeated the same trick on him. They cut to black just as her hand connected with her fist. Then there was the sound of a very loud slap. Then Sam yelled, "OW! Hey, the Stooges didn't bleed!"
    -   Sometimes, one more line can be heard. In "Death Takes A Holiday On Ice", which ends with Carla heading to the backroom to play a game of billiards. After the cut to black, we hear the cue ball hitting the balls and one falling into a pocket.
-   Nearly every episode of _Scrubs_ ends with JD comparing and tying together all the different plot threads in a voiceover, either learning An Aesop or making an observation of some sort. Subverted as often as not in later seasons, but the lack of a summation to make sense of everything usually only occurs in particularly bleak or jarring episodes (for example, "My Lunch").
-   _King of the Nerds_: Each episode concludes with the eliminated contestant marching out of the mansion, as they narrate their last goodbyes and wistful music plays... until one of the hosts taps an iPad, obliterates them the moment before they set foot off the property, and makes a cheesy pun about it.
-   From 1973 to 2001, all but two episodes of _Mister Rogers' Neighborhood_ ended with Rogers singing "It's Such A Good Feeling".
    -   The two exceptions were opera episodes from The '80s, where the song was presumably cut for time (they also opened with a Truncated Theme Tune).
    -   Before that, from 1968-70, every episode closed with the song "Tomorrow". The 1971 season featured a different closing song ("The Weekend Song") on Fridays, while the 1972 season featured a rotation between "Good Feeling" and the two previous songs.
-   Every episode of _JAG_ ended with a freeze frame, usually of one or two of the main characters either smiling or showing a concerned look.
-   _Good Luck Charlie_ had Teddy's last entry in the video diary for that episode, which always ended with a Title Drop.
-   _Pyramid_: "For now, Dick Clark...\*Military Salute\*...So long."
-   _Press Your Luck_: "Until next time, this is Peter Tomarken saying thanks for pressing your luck, bye-bye!"
-   Nearly every episode of _Duck Dynasty_ ends with the Robertson clan gathered around the dinner table, where Phil (or occasionally Willie) prays over the food, followed by Willie narrating the Aesop.
-   _Singled Out_ always ended with the set turned into a dance floor open to all of the day's contestants.
-   The UK version of _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_ ended with "It just remains for me to thank (the four panelists), Richard Vranch at the piano, this is me, Clive Anderson, saying goodnight. Goodnight."
-   _Hee Haw_ always closed with the assembled cast singing a "so long" song. Originally, it was a somber-toned, "We love the time we spend with you...." changed in the last season to a more upbeat, "So long, we sure had a good time..." The credits would then run under a jaunty version of the theme, followed by Cathy Baker poking her head through an opening in the wall and announcing perkily, "That's all!"
-   Every episode of the Nickelodeon version of _Robot Wars_ will give out an advisory warning that building a robot is extremely dangerous and should not be attempted without great care.
-   _Soul Train_:
    
    **Don Cornelius**: "That oughta do it for a while, I hope we can do it again on these same stations, and you can bet your last money, it's going to be a stone gas honey! I'm Don Cornelius, and as always in parting, we wish you love...peace...and..."
    
    **Dancers**: "SOUL!!"
    
-   Every episode of _Happy Days_ ends with offscreen singers reprising the last few lines of the theme song ("These happy days are yours and mine, happy days!").
-   "I Love Lucy is a Desilu production."
-   From 1969 to 1974 there was a French Canadian family sitcom where every episode ended with anyone of the characters exclaiming "Quelle famille!" (literally, "What a family!"). The title of the show? You've guessed it.
    -   Which makes it also a case of Title Drop and of Family Title (kinda).
-   _Deadtime Stories_ has the main characters of the current story, and the two kids who are being read the story, screaming at each other when something scary happens at the end.
-   _Zoboomafoo_: At the end of every episode Chris, Martin, & Zoboo would sing the goodbye song "Animal Friend". Chris and Martin would leave animal junction on another adventure and Zoboo would return to the wild.
-   _The Sunny Side Up Show_: During split-screen credits, the hosts read more viewer messages as well as occasionally a birthday card. They then mention _The Sprout Sharing Show_ and _The Good Night Show_ before saying goodbye to the viewers.
-   Every episode of _Midnight Caller_ ended with Jack Killian signing off on his radio show. And every episode of _that_ ended "Godnight, America, wherever you are."
-   _Life With Elizabeth_ would end with the announcer breaking in with "Say good night to the people.", the actors on screen breaking character and saying "Goodnight!" to the audience and then returning to what they were doing for a few seconds before the closing credits.
-   Every episode for Studio 100's _Kabouter Plop_ ends with Plop saying "Plopper De Plop" at the viewer and his hat would rise up.
-   "...and that will bring this case to a close. That will do it for this edition of _The People's Court_, and remember:
    -   If someone is suing you, and you're convinced you did nothing wrong, don't be afraid to stand up for your rights. Go to court."
    -   If you are in a dispute with another party, and you just can't seem to work it out, don't take the laws into your own hands, you take 'em to court."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   "_The Jeffersons_ was recorded on tape before a studio audience."
    -   Along with many other American sitcoms before and after this one, going well into at least the late 1980s, in most cases with variarions (e.g., "filmed", or "taped" rather than "recorded on tape").
-   _Fixer Upper_ always ends with the couple being shown their new home inside and out, followed by footage of them with their friends and/or extended family having a large gathering inside the house.
-   _Tiere bis unters Dach_: Until season 6, every episode ended with Greta or Nellie (or in one case Pauline) turning to the camera and smiling, followed by a freeze frame.
-   _Kids Court_: During the show's closing credits. Host Paul Provenza would ask the kids in the studio audience on what their situation problem is. And would ask "Do you think it's fair or unfair?" And the kids in the studio audience usually reply "UNFAIR!" in unison.
-   Most episodes of _Pretty Little Liars_ end with a short "A" P.O.V. Cam scene.
-   _Tales from the Darkside_:
    
    "The Darkside is always there, waiting for us to enter, waiting to enter us. Until next time, try to enjoy the daylight!"
    
-   Each Monty Hall era of _Let's Make a Deal_ would end with Monty doing various "quick deals" with random audience members while the credits are rolling.
    -   "(The All-New) Let's Make a Deal is a Stefan Hatos-Monty Hall production! (This is Jay Stewart speaking!)"
-   Preschool series _The Big Garage_ had this line from Pump at the end of every episode, as Rusty was called home to Scrapland by Scrap:
    
    **Pump:** Oh well, that's it for another busy day at the Big Garage. I'm sure things will start to quiet down now.
    
    **Scrap:** Rusty!
    
    **Pump:** But not too quiet! (laughs)
    
    **Scrap:** Rusty! RUSTY!!!
    
-   Every _Morecambe and Wise_ show ended with the duo doing a (straight and non-comedic) song-and-dance routine to the standard "Bring Me Sunshine" with the credits rolled over them.
-   _Without a Trace_ concluded every episode with a blurb on a _real_ missing persons case, narrated by a cast member, resulting in at least five people being found. (Episodes that aired in foreign countries—Australia, Hong Kong, etc.—featured their own cases).
    -   In one episode, where it turned out that the Victim of the Week had committed suicide, viewers were directed to a suicide hotline.
-   The _Batman (1966)_ TV show had an every _other_ episode ending. Most plots spanned two episodes, with the first half ending in a cliffhanger and the iconic to-be-continued announcement: "Tune in tomorrow - same bat-time, same bat-channel!"
-   Every episode of _Harry Hill's TV Burp_ broke halfway with a ridiculous fight, and ended with a ridiculous musical number related to something from another show Harry has just been making fun of—often featuring the person being made fun of. Harry then closed the show with "That's all from us!"
-   The 1999 _Zoom_ series:
    -   Each episode of Seasons 1 and 2 end with the "Address Song".
    -   Each episode of Seasons 3, 4 and 5 end with an online ad.
    -   Each episode of Seasons 6 and 7 end with an outro where the Zoomers say that it was the end of their show and thank the viewers for watching and say bye.
-   _Mimpi Metropolitan_: Every episode ends with a quote (related to the episode's plot or ending) being displayed on screen and spoken by one of the characters to the audience.
-   Every episode of _Riget_ sees series creator, Lars von Trier, showing up during the end credits to deliver a closing monologue, during which he usually cracks some dry jokes about the plot of the episode and delivers a bit of Script Wank. He then always finishes his monologue by wishing the viewers a pleasant evening, and reminds them and reminding them, in case they wish to spend more time with the series, they should be prepared to "Take the Good, with the Bad," as he first does the sign of the cross followed by the sign of the horns.
-   _Chockablock_: Each episode ends with Chockabloke or Chockagirl "checking out", before pressing a button on Chockablock's mainframe, getting into the Chockatruck and driving off as the credits begin to roll. The last thing shown is a (post-credits) shot of Chockablock powering down in an empty studio.
-   Ever since the Third Doctor era, _Doctor Who_ almost always ends its episodes with the iconic "electronic scream" (which can be spelt out as "EEEEEEEIIIUUUUUUWH!"), a sound effect that is comprised of a metallic, high-pitched synth note descending in pitch (like if it was screaming) alongside a deep, vibrating synth note ascending in pitch. Considering the classic series usually ends their episodes on cliffhangers, it makes sense to have the sound effect play at the end of the episode. The sound became so iconic to the fans, to the point where this sound is used at the start of the show's theme throughout the revival series (in addition to being used at the end of each episode).

    Music 

-   Overkill ended their first four albums with a numbered part of the Overkill saga (though the last part "Evil Never Dies" wasn't titled as such), and continued it on Immortalis.
-   Iron Maiden 's The First Ten Years series always ends with commentary by Nicko on the tracks from the release. A further part discussing "No Prayer For The Dying" was included on the album's US pressing.
-   All of Bathory's early albums have a nearly identical outro track called "The Winds of Mayhem."

    Podcasts 

-   Every episode of Within the Wires ends with "you time", where three incongruous and seemingly-random things are suggested for your relaxation (in the first season) or for purchase from the museum gift shop (in the second season).
    
    OK, our time is done. It’s you time now. Time to stop by the museum gift shop. Grab yourself a souvenir book of paintings about **potato cannons**. Pick up a poster featuring **a vulture in a tuxedo**. And buy a commemorative vase made out of **baby back ribs**. (From season 2 episode 2)
    
-   Every regular episode of _'80s All Over_ ends with the Embassy Pictures logo music, followed by the VHS tape being taken out of the VCR and popped into a rewinder, fading out on the sound of it being rewound. This also serves Bookends to the traditional opening of each episode, which has a tape popped into the VCR and the Play button pushed.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Each of the vignettes leading up to "The American Dream" Dusty Rhodes' debut in the "WW \[blank\]" ended with an off-screen vocal (usually the person Dusty just "helped") saying "Hey, aren't you...?"

    Puppet Shows 

-   On _Bear in the Big Blue House_, Bear performs the "Goodbye Song" with Luna. He then gives a brief goodbye to the viewer, summing things up for the episode, and turns off the Big Blue House's attic light. He then remembers that he has something else to say, turns it back on, says it, and then turns the light back off.
-   Every episode of _Oobi_, including those that leave the title character Out of Focus, will end with him telling the viewers, "Oobi, you, friends!" before saying goodbye. Children voice will also say goodbye to him.
-   The closing theme for _The Muppet Show_ built up to a drumroll pause that allowed Caustic Critics Statler and Waldorf an opportunity for one last joke at the show's expense.
-   Episodes of _Mopatop's Shop_ ended with the big clock in the shop going off, prompting Mopatop and Puppyduck to close the shop.
-   _Lamb Chop's Play-Along_ "This is the song that doesn't end...yes it goes on and on my friend. Some people started singing it not knowing what it was, and they'll continue singing it forever just because" (repeat!)
-   _Barney & Friends_: "I love you, you love me, we're a happy family...."
    -   Most episodes featured a segment called "Barney Says," where Barney recaps the episode, but it's not nearly as iconic as "I Love You."
-   _Sesame Street_ episodes end with a recap of the letter and number of the day. If an episode has an _Elmo's World_ segment, that will always be the penultimate segment of the episode.

    Radio 

-   The "News From Lake Wobegon" segment of _A Prairie Home Companion_ ends with the monologue, "And that's the news from Lake Wobegon, where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children... are above average."
-   "Well, that's all the time we have this week for _The Vinyl Cafe_. Special thanks to _\[musicians and special guests\]_ and Anton Szabo for the technical assistance. Dave Amers is the founding producer of _The Vinyl Cafe_, Louise Curtis is the production assistant, Julie Penner is the music producer, Meg Masters is the long-suffering story editor. _The Vinyl Cafe_ is produced by Jess Milton. I'm Stuart Maclean, in _\[location\]_. So long for now." (CBC Radio)
    -   Other than radio talk shows, this is also common in radio sportscasts as well. Even TV sportscasts do it occasionally. In fact, this is common to any radio show since they can't quickly scroll (or whatever) the credits for all to see.
-   _Car Talk_ ends with Klick and Klack noting that you've frittered away another perfectly good hour before reading the credits - then reading some fake credits such as "...Our optimetric firm is C.F. Eye Care, Our personal chef is Howard M. Burgers, Our researcher is Paul Murky of Murky Research, assisted by statistician Marge Innovera..." and concludes with:
    
    **Klick**: "And until next time... don't drive like my brother."
    
    **Klack**: "And don't drive like _my_ brother!"
    
-   _Yours Truly Johnny Dollar_ actually used the same line as the ending, the title and the conceit. Johnny Dollar was an insurance investigator, and each episode was an explanation of the expense report he was typing up for his bosses (all of which, of course, had extremely dramatic and entertaining reasons). At the end of the letter/the episode, he would state the total, occasionally commenting that it was unusually low and "I must be slipping!" Then he'd sign the letter "Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar."
-   Most (all?) NPR shows end with the host saying "This…is NPR." In the past it was "This is NPR, National Public Radio."
-   _Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me_ ends with funny predictions from the three panelists, usually escalating some news item from that week's show, followed by Bill Kurtis saying, "And if any of those things happen, panel, we'll ask you about it on _Wait Wait Don't Tell Me!_"
-   At the end of _The Burns and Allen Show_, George typically cued his wife to say good night to the audience. Contrary to what most people think, Gracie would then say, "Good night!"
-   _Mark Steel's In Town_ ends with Mark reading a pastiche of a well-known story with connections to the town he's in, bringing in as many of the Running Gags from the preceding stand-up routine as possible, and often claiming that this is what the author actually wrote, because that's just what the town's like.

    Theatre 

-   Shows of the Crazy Horse cabaret of Paris always end with the massive pole dance number "You Turn Me On".
-   _Tou Stage_ productions always end with a song and an elegant parasol dance, which doubles as a curtain call for the principal actors.

    Video Games 

-   Every _Mario Kart_ game ends with Rainbow Road, which is the hardest track in every game it appears in. (Usually, anyway) The retro cups in _Mario Kart DS_ and _Mario Kart Wii_ don't close with Rainbow Road, but they do from _Mario Kart 7_ onwards.
-   _Paper Mario_ and its sequels had "END OF CHAPTER" followed by a plot summary after the defeat of each major boss.
    -   In fact, nearly every Mario game has something like this: Hopping on the pole, playing a card-matching game, or in the 3D games getting a magic star-shaped item signified the end of a normal level, and usually the rescue of some significant being signified the end of the Zone (Toads/Princess in the original, Kings of the Kingdom in the third).
    -   _Super Paper Mario_ also narrates Timpani/Tippi and Blumiere/Count Bleck's backstory piece by piece once each chapter is ended.
-   For the Genesis _Sonic the Hedgehog_ games, the non-final acts of each zone would be concluded by whizzing past a revolving sign that changes from Robotnik/Eggman's face to Sonic's (or another character if Sonic's not the one being used). _Sonic 3 & Knuckles_ and _Sonic Mania_ maintained this tradition, even when there was a miniboss at the end of these zones, by having the sign fall from the sky after you defeat the miniboss.
    -   The final act of each zone would conclude with you opening a capsule of captured animals after the boss fight.
    -   _Knuckles Chaotix_ instead ended every zone by having a giant ring fall out of Dr. Eggman's latest contraption.
-   _Devil May Cry_: When you clear a mission in the classic continuity games, the screen is punctured with bullet holes, then shatters to reveal the ranking screen. In the _Special Edition_ of _Devil May Cry 4_ and _Devil May Cry 5_, playable Vergil's missions end with the screen being slashed instead, as a reference to him relying on his trademark Yamato katana instead of firearms.
-   Race victories in _Need for Speed: Most Wanted_ are punctuated by a camera zooming in and taking a picture of your car.
-   After important events (For example, saving Mesarthim in Asellus' game, or receiving the gift for a new school of magic in Blue's) in _SaGa Frontier_ ends with a portrait of either the protagonist you're using, or an important character from it.
-   _Ōkami_ ends every boss battle with a victory howl from Amaterasu. (It gets subverted in the battle against Yami when he doesn't stay down the first time and drains all the power from Ammy, but then Ammy comes back to kick ass anyway.
-   In _Astal_, when the title character clears a level, he does a Fist Pump and yells "YATTA!!" (even in the English version).
-   When Japanese video games released in English display "owari" (which consists of the hiragana o, wa, and ri) at the end of the credits, it will usually be replaced by "END," in which the three English letters substitute each of the three Japanese kana.
-   Every game in the _Ace Attorney_ series ends with the protagonist shouting "OBJECTION!"
    -   The second game suggests that the _player_ shout it into the DS microphone. Of course, you don't have to; just press A at that point and the ending will still play.
-   Every _Goemon Impact_ boss battle in _Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon_ (except the last one, being the Final Boss of the game) ends with Impact punching down the boss at its moment of defeat, then the boss blows up, one of Impact's eyes flashes, then the _Mystical Ninja_ logo drops down.
-   _Suikoden_ games typically end with still screens rattling off every character you recruited for the hero's army, and their fates following the game. Occasionally, these things would reference earlier or later games. In a few instances, depending on the player's actions, the ending text could differ for certain characters.
-   _Every_ mission in _Mass Effect 2_ ends with an after action report from the Illusive Man and a snippet of his theme.
-   In _inFAMOUS 2_, every time after absorbing a Blast Core, the screen will go black and inform how many miles The Beast is away from your location, and how many Blast Cores is still needed to activate the RFI.
-   Once the final hit is landed in every _Mega Man_ game, the boss explodes, victorious music starts playing, and then Mega Man jumps in the middle of the stage to absorb the power of the Robot, before cutting to a scene that shows what weapon you got. Dr. Wily begs for mercy at the end of each game in the Classic series.
    -   In the _Mega Man X_ series, X or Zero instead stoically watch the spectacular explosions given off by the boss upon defeat, then a victorious fanfare plays. Afterwards, they strike a pose, teleport out and your new ability is explained.
-   In _Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest_ if you land on the target from high enough, it's different depending on the character you control. If its Diddy, he gets a boombox and sunglasses with his hat turned sideways and he starts rapping (in oohs and ahs, as he is a monkey). If it is Dixie, she pulls out an electric guitar and plays a sweet solo. Afterwards, they both run off.
-   Beat a boss in a _Kirby_ game? Expect to see two extra Kirbies inexplicably pop up for the Kirby dance.
-   In _The Walking Dead (Telltale)_ you start off an episode with a "Previously on" and end an episode with a trailer for the upcoming episode. Seeing as Telltale releases most of their games in this style in chapters staggered across a year, this helps as a reminder what actually happened and wets your appetite for the upcoming parts.
-   The first four games (both console and handheld) in the _Skylanders_ series all ended with Spirit Advisor Eon telling the Portal Master AKA the player; "The journey with your Skylanders and \[\[gimmick Skylanders of the game\]\] is only just beginning".

    Western Animation 

-   Porky Pig's catchphrase at the end of many _Looney Tunes_ shorts, "T-T-T-That's all, folks!"
    -   It wasn't always Porky. In the early days it was said (minus stutter, of course) by various characters, like Bosko or Buddy. For the early _Merrie Melodies_, it was a nameless jester character. There are even a few cartoons that end with Bugs Bunny saying, "And that's the end!"
-   In a nod to the first game's ending, every episode of _Earthworm Jim_ would end with a cow falling on somebody. Sometimes it would fall on Jim, sometimes it would fall on the villain, and sometimes it would fall on the very thing that Jim spent the entire episode trying to save. "Opposites Attack" featured an Evil Cow falling on Evil Jim.
-   In _Inspector Gadget_, after his nefarious scheme is foiled, Claw would threaten, "I'll get you next time, Gadget! Next time!", followed by his cat howling, over the end credits.
-   _Tiny Toon Adventures_, in a nod to _Looney Tunes_, had several of the show's characters giving their own unique parting words:
-   Similarly, _Animaniacs_ has a final gag with the Warners (or sometimes other characters) popping out of the water tower.
-   _Pinky and the Brain_ usually ended with this exchange, or a slight variation on it:
    
    **Brain**: "Let's get back to the lab and plan for tomorrow night."  
    **Pinky**: "Why, Brain? What are we going to do tomorrow night?"  
    **Brain**: "The same thing we do every night, Pinky: try to Take Over the World!"
    
    -   Here are some of the slight variations:
    
    "_try to take over the world from Joyce DeWitt!_"
    
    "_try to take over Chia World!_"
    
    "_try to take over Oz!_"
    
    (in an episode that takes place in Shakespearean times): "_try to take over the Globe...Theater!_"
    
    (in a Very Special Episode where the Brain gets hooked on cigarettes): "\* coughs\* try to quit smoking. Hand me that Nicorette patch."
    
    (in episodes where Pinky and the Brain actually have to _save_ the world from Brain's Arch-Nemesis): "The same thing we _didn't_ do last night, Pinky: _try to take over the world!_"
    
    (in the episode where the Brain gives sentience to the Earth) "Well, there's one thing we _can_ do: _try to take over the moon!_"
    
    (in Wakko's Wish) "_plan for the sequel where we'll take over the kingdom and the world!_"
    
    (in which the Brain suffers a Never Recycle Your Schemes crisis)  
    **Pinky:** What now, Brain? Back to our mushroom house to prepare for tomorrow night?  
    **Brain:** No, Pinky. We shall stop at a pharmacy and purchase a tube of denture adhesive and then attach our bodies to the bottom of Air Force One.  
    **Pinky:** So we can take over the world?  
    **Brain:** No, it's just fun, fun, silly-willy... narf.
    
    (in which the duo become popular children's show characters in The '50s)  
    **Brain:** Come, Pinky. We have work to do.  
    **Pinky:** You mean taking over the world?  
    **Brain:** No, Pinky. Finding a good hiding place.
    
    (in which the Brain tries to create a story about himself as a folklore hero)  
    **Pinky:** What are we going to do tomorrow night, Big Crabby See-Saw Kwanzaa Hot Mutton Chop Zeke<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ?  
    **Brain:** Work on learning each other's names, and then... try to take over the world!
    
    (last, but not least, in a rare daytime episode involving their "day jobs" as lab mice in mazes):  
    **Brain**: We must prepare for tomorrow morning.  
    **Pinky**: What are we going to do tomorrow morning?  
    **Brain**: The same thing we do every morning, Pinky: run through that stupid maze.
    
    -   And of course, there's the subversion in the episode "Ambulatory Abe":
        
        **Brain:** Come, Pinky, we must—well, you know.
        
    
    -   There's also the trademark voiceover ending of "They're dinky, they're Pinky and the Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain..." just before the end credits music. Certain episodes change this slightly in either the wording or the delivery. The Halloween episode had demon voices saying it followed by Pinky's catchphrases and the Devil yelling "Stop that!"
-   _Three Delivery_ ends each episode the same way: The trio and Nana put the rescued recipe in the cookbook before returning to the restaurant for another comedic moment.
-   Nearly every episode of _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_ ended with a shot of the titular protagonists and the narrator exclaiming, "And So Once Again, the Day Is Saved, thanks to... the Powerpuff Girls!" The only exceptions are when the ending segment is purposefully subverted.
    -   Where the girls don't save the day, in "Him Diddle Riddle": "And so... uh... hmm... yeah."
    -   When the girls get fed up with the people of Townsville's attitude and force them to destroy a monster without the girls' help: "... the day is saved with no thanks to the Powerpuff Girls. Hey... I did that all by myself!"
    -   When the Time Travel episode reveals Mojo Jojo's caused the Stable Time Loop that led to the girls' existence: "And So Once Again, the Day Is Saved, thanks to the Powerpuff Girls... but thanks originally to Mojo Jojo who, once again, had a hand in creating the Powerpuff Girls!" This variant was also used when it was revealed that he caused the Chemical X accident, which led to the creation of the Powerpuff Girls.
    -   When the episode centered around a couple of elderly heroes who were out to fight their out-of-retirement, equally elderly foes, and Blossom refused to allow the girls to intervene: the episode ends with all the old men falling over and breaking various limbs. Instead of the narrator, an in-story newscaster says over the end card "in this reporter's opinion, all this could have been avoided if the Powerpuff Girls had just saved the day."
    -   The episode "Boogie Frights" ended with the narrator beating the audience over the head with the ironic use of "the day is saved" while the girls try to sleep in their bed (Bubbles in particular was not bothered at all).
    -   The episode where Antidote X is introduced ended with, "And the day is saved thanks to the normal little girls".
    -   In the episode where the Powerpuff Girls are given a curfew, letting the villains run amuck at night, they finally beat them when they're told it's Daylight Savings Time and it's actually an hour earlier ended with "And the day is saved thanks to... Benjamin Franklin for coming up with the idea to move clocks back an hour to save on lamp oil, and the Powerpuff Girls!"
    -   "And so... for the first... and final time... \* sniff\* the day... is saved... thanks to the Powerpuff... Bunny! \* sniff\* \* sob\* "
    -   The Narrator was very uncomfortable the one time he was forced to announce that "the day was saved by... Mojo Jojo, Fuzzy Lumpkins, and Him!?"
    -   He also once had to say that The Powerpuff Girls saved the day... even though they were the ones who caused the trouble in the first place...
    -   The episode _A Very Special Blossom_ ends with the Narrator saying thanks to only Bubbles and Buttercup, and not to Blossom (who was sent to custody on stealing the golf stuff from the golf shop). And we see Blossom behind bars.
    -   The episode "Criss Cross Crisis" ended with Bubbles and the Narrator swapping bodies with Voices Are Mental, so the ending lines are narrated with Bubbles's voice instead.
    -   In "Uh Oh, Dynamo", when the Professor forces the three to fight the Monster of the Week in a Humongous Mecha, resulting in Townsville getting destroyed, the outro has the narrator calling him out on it.
    -   The Narrator tries to say the ending line in "The Headsucker's Moxy", but forgets due to a headache, due to falling victim to the Robbing Leech. Also, the girls and "THE END" never appear.
    -   "Super Zeroes" ended with, "So once again, the day is saved... with _no_ thanks to Liberty Belle, Harmony Bunny and Mange... but to the one and only Powerpuff Girls!"
    -   "Stray Bullet" ends with the narrator saying how Bullet the Powerpuff Squirrel saved the say in squirrel language.
    -   "Simian Says" saw Mojo kidnap the Narrator and take his role to try to get rid of the girls. Once they stop him, they find the Narrator locked in a closet. He ends the episode, and the girls give him a ride home.
    -   "Nano of the North" ends with the regular line, only the girls are shrunken in size, with a tiny voice to match. "THE END" appears small as well.
-   In _Superjail!_, dumb recidivist criminal (and arguably main character) Jackknife escapes from the titular The Alcatraz at the end of every episode only to be recaptured at the beginning of the next.
-   Nearly every episode of _Scooby-Doo_ ends with the villain of the day being unmasked and then saying "and I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for You Meddling Kids!"
    -   Afterwards, Scooby would give his trademark "battle cry" (if you can call it that) of "Scooby-Dooby-Dooooooooooooooo!!!" (although, this didn't happen until later), usually after he initiates one last gag.
-   In _The Flintstones_, every episode ended with Fred being locked out of the house by the cat and trying in vain to get back in.
-   Animal's "_Go_ bye-bye!" skit at the end of every _Muppet Babies_ episode, usually with him engaged in some dangerous activity as Gonzo fruitlessly tries to stop him. This occurs after not just the credits, but also the closing logos as well.
-   Each episode of _C.O.P.S._ end with the scene going to a still frame, which then pans out to reveal it is actually a photograph being entered into a police file. Team leader Bulletproof then restates the name of the episode and closes the file while saying "Case Closed." Subverted in part one of the two-parter, when Bulletproof leaves the file open and ends with, "Case... continued?"
-   Every episode of _Dora the Explorer_ ends with Dora and Boots (and sometimes a friend who accompanies them) telling the viewer what their favorite parts of the episode were.
-   _Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist_: "You know what the music means. Our time is up."
-   Every episode of _Birdman (1967)_ would end with Birdman flying into the sky, bellowing his own name, often followed by Avenger cawing.
-   As a parody of Oh, Cisco!\-type endings, every _Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law_ episode ends with the cast and a few walk-ons laughing uproariously at something (or nothing).
-   Most episodes of _Doug_ end with Doug writing a journal entry stating what he learned from all that.
-   The Playhouse Disney "Tasty Time with Ze Fronk" shorts usually end with "Get out of my kitchen you silly cat!" complete with Ze Fronk chasing Dom (the cat) around the kitchen.
-   In the _Action Man (1995)_ cartoon series, each episode ends with Action Man reflecting about the missing memory he has recovered during that episode.
-   Nellie the Elephant dreams of going back to the jungle where all the other elephants lived.
    -   Subverted in one episode, when Nellie gets stuck on the train, and can't get out, and wants to go back to the jungle, but she can't. Until she squiggled and wiggled and bumped, and left with edited Stock Footage.
-   Every episode of _The Ghost and Molly McGee_ ends with a Smash Cut to the show's title against a black screen as the last line of the theme song is sung.
-   Just about every single episode of _House of Mouse_ would end with Mike Microphone presenting a different sponsor parodying a different Disney movie. For example, one such sponsor is that of a magic spritzer that can make Eeyore gain a smile on his face, and turn Grumpy into Happy.
-   _Count Duckula_: "Good night out there, _whatever_ you are."
-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_: "End transmission."
-   _Lilo & Stitch: The Series_: The episode's featured experiment in its one true place; however, a third of the episodes end with the experiment being captured by Gantu, and it takes until the end of the series until they are finally released.
-   _Little Bill_: "Little Bill, who are you talking to?"
-   _Little Einsteins_ end each episode with the team and the unseen audience (and the viewers) giving a hand as they recap on the art (or artist) and the music and its composer featured in the episode. This was mostly spoken in the first season. The second season has a song carrying the same purpose.
-   Nearly every episode of _Blaze and the Monster Machines_ ends with the scene irising out on Crusher getting the last joke of the episode (especially his subplot introduced in Season 2). This was mostly dropped by Season 4.

-   _Phineas and Ferb_
    
    **Phineas:** Oh, there you are, Perry.  
    **Perry:** _(chortles)_  
    **Ferb:** _(insert one-liner here)_
    
    -   Expect a guitar strike at the _really_ end of each episode.
-   _Albie_: someone shouting "AAAAAAAALLL_BIIEEEEEEEE!_"
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Every episode (except for the more action-focused multi-parters) ends with the episode's featured character announcing the moral of the episode. The first season has Twilight write Celestia a letter beginning with "Dear Princess Celestia..." explaining what she's learned. Starting with season two, the rest of the cast begin writing letters as well, and the show shifts to more of an ensemble series as a result. The show started to phase out of this ending in Season 3. In season 4, the letters to Celestia were replaced with a journal that the main characters all wrote in. From season 5 onward this device was dropped completely.

-   _The Jetsons_: George, trapped on the dogwalker running for his life, shouting "Jane! Stop this crazy thing!"
-   _Olive the Ostrich_, a series seen in the U.S. on PBS Kids Sprout always has a very specific ending.

Olive pokes her head out of the sand and her mother comments that she's daydreaming again. Olive protests that she was having such-and-such adventure and her father comments that her head's been in the sand too long. Her brother laughs, but the narrator states that Olive wasn't listening because she was already dreaming up her next big adventure.
-   _Project Gee Ke R_: Moloch's plans are foiled again, and he utters an angry, "_Geeker..._"
-   _Sushi Pack_ ends with the Pack jumping into the air and shouting "Sushi Pack!"
    -   The only exception is the episode "Lights Out," when Unagi helped them save the day and all six of them shouted "Go Planet Earth!"
-   Each episode of the _Madeline_ cartoon (including the original specials) ends with the narrator saying, "And that's all there is. There isn't any more." Those lines originally appeared at the end of the first _Madeline_ book.
-   Each Commander McBragg segment (first seen on Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales) ends the same way:
    
    **(unnamed second character):** Commander, \[calls him out on his bragging with a pun or some other funny saying\].  
    **Commander McBragg:** Quite.
    
-   _The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!_: "Until next time, everybody, Do the Mario!"
-   With the exception of the series finale, every episode of _Redwall_ ends with scenes from the episode being shown as part of a tapestry while the show's theme plays.
-   All of the "Peabody's Improbable History" segments in _Rocky and Bullwinkle_ ended with Mr. Peabody (or on rare occasion, Sherman) making a horrible pun. This carries over to _The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show_, where each time travel story ends the same way.
-   In _Tickety Toc_, every episode ends with Tommy and Tallulah making it to Chime Time so they can stand on the clock's platform and drum and trumpet to mark the time.
-   Every episode of _Lolirock_ ends with the main characters singing a song (since they're part of a band, and all). Interestingly, even though the song's always the same one, it avoids using Stock Footage most of the time.
-   Most of the _3-2-1 Penguins!_ episodes ended with the Rockhopper flying off into the night after Jason and Michelle finished praying.
-   On _Wild Animal Baby Explorers_, the explorers imitate something done by one of the animals they saw in the episode, then sing a song about how great they are, followed by a brief concluding segment.
-   This happens in _The Addams Family (1992)_, where half hour episodes mostly end with one of the family members deciding to conduct a family dance for resolving the problem of the week. One proposes a dance that another family member dismisses because of some requirement not being met, leading to another dance being suggested and the family agreeing to groove to that one.
-   _SpacePOP_: To TOTALLY Be Continued!
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: Starting from Season 9B and especially from Season 11, almost every episode ends with an Iris Out.
-   The final part of each 4-part story on _Underdog_ usually ended with three people, not the same ones each time, mind you, saying, "It's a bird! It's a plane! It's a frog!" Underdog would then reply with, "Not bird, nor plane, nor even frog, it's just little old me-" at which point he'd crash into something and sheeplily finish: "Underdog."
-   _Chalkzone_: Every full episode ends with a music video featuring Rudy, Penny and Snap, complete with band names for the appropriate situation such as Rudy and the Chalkzone Band, Rudy and the Chalkzone Gang, or Rudy Tabootie and Chums.

-   Each episode of _B.O.T. and the Beasties_ ends with B.O.T's nose finally glowing green and him heading up to his pod, sometimes the beastie will watch and then run off screen. It's always held by the narration "All data collected for \*insert Beastie here\*, mission complete!"
-   _Animal Mechanicals_ had "Can we Mechana-do it? We Animal Mechanical can!" followed sometimes by the group cheering or just enjoying the island around them.
-   Each episode of _BB3B_ would end with the plot tied up before zooming out to reveal a fleet of Sprogs heading to Earth.
-   Every _Blue's Clues_ episode ended with Steve or Joe thanking the viewer for their help, singing "The So Long Song" and then saying goodbye to the viewer before going to the credits. At the end of the credits, Blue shows up one last time, playing with her ball, and then either winking to the audience (Steve's episodes) or barking to them (Joe's episodes) before the book the show was set in closed and the closing logos appeared.
-   _Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum_: Every episode ends with the kids back in the white void (like in the episode's cold open), and they thank the viewer for joining their awesome adventure to meet the episode's historical hero.

-   _Let's Go Luna!_: The episodes end with Luna going back into the night sky and reminding the others that there's always tomorrow to learn more about the world.
-   _Oh Yeah! Cartoons_: Every short (with the exceptions of _Planet Kate_ and _Fathead_) ends with a clip of a character(s) from the short (usually but not always the main character) appearing in the _Oh Yeah! Cartoons_ logo while shouting the series' title (though the one for "Max and his Special Problem" and "Max and the Pigeon Incident" instead has Max raise a finger and then shrug while grunting).
-   _The Magic School Bus_ ended episodes with a segment featuring a fictional producer getting called about things the episode got wrong with the daily subject (which is accurate to the books the series is based off). Sometimes the producer was a male, sometimes it was a female, sometimes it was both of the two producers, and on some occasions the person taking the calls was someone from the episode.
