_"We Never Sleep."_

— **Motto of the Pinkertons**

An agent of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, "Pinkertons" for short, "Pinks" to their enemies.

Founded in the 1850s by Allan Pinkerton, the Pinkertons were often hired by corporations such as the railroad companies to investigate crimes against them and the activities of labor movements. Made famous by their protection of Abraham Lincoln from an assassination attempt prior to his taking the oath of office. In the 1870s, they added government work to their portfolio, as the Department of Justice did not have the infrastructure to do massive investigations on its own. (This work dried up in 1893 with the passage of the "Anti-Pinkerton Act", which prevented the US government from directly hiring Pinkerton agents.)

In addition to their notorious and much-reviled strikebreaking work, the Pinkertons were also active in chasing down outlaws who had pulled train jobs or major bank robberies. And if you were wealthy enough, you could hire them for regular detective work as well. The Pinks were well known for brutality and ruthlessness in their methods; in fiction, even when they are pursuing more laudable goals, this tends to give an unfavorable color to their portrayal.

It's believed the phrase "private eye" comes from the Pinkerton Agency's symbol, an open eye (which rather hilariously came to look like the CBS eye in later years). Dashiell Hammett was a former Pinkerton agent, and used his experience to inform his stories.

After the 1930s, the Pinkerton Agency largely concerned itself with security services. They were bought and merged with a Swedish security company called Securitas AB, and they are now known as Securitas Security Services USA, Inc. Poetically, Securitas is now the subject of unionization attempts. But that still hasn't stopped companies like Amazon from using Pinkerton operatives to spy on workers and labor unions.

Compare and contrast with Private Intelligence Agency, which is what the company does nowadays after Securitas purchased the company and its assets. Hilariously unrelated to Real Men Wear Pink.

No relation to the Weezer album _Pinkerton_, though the agency did file a Frivolous Lawsuit against the band, accusing them of trademark infringement. (The case was thrown out immediately.)

    -   At the start of the "Death Cell" storyline Tex is framed for murder and it's mentioned they've been contacted to help find information to prove his innocence and catch the culprit before he and his accomplice can start an Indian war and have the Navajos evicted from their reserve. By the end of the storyline Tex and his pards have identified the culprit and found enough evidence to convict him and prove Tex' innocence on their own... And the Pinks reveal they have identified _every single other member of the organization and provided enough evidence to arrest them_, without even appearing on-page until one of their agents shows up to reveal what they've done in the meantime.
    -   The "Pinkerton Lady" storyline chronicles Tex' first encounter with them, as he, then young and wanted for murder, found himself involved with them saving Abraham Lincoln's life from an assassination attempt.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   The Hollywood western _3:10 to Yuma (1957)_ and its 2007 remake feature Pinkerton agents escorting an armed stagecoach filled with bank notes through Arizona. Pinkerton agents are seen throughout the 2007 version, and it's worth noting that in the remake the main Pinkerton is both a badass and deeply unpleasant character.

-   The 2005 movie _The Legend of Zorro_ has Pinkerton agents extorting the wife of Zorro to help them investigate a secret society trying to prevent the 1850 admission of California to the Union. Rather anachronistically, since the Pinkertons weren't formed until after that event.

Fish, the American lurking about the Chimneys mansion as murder and identity theft and all sorts of crazy things are going on, is a chance for Agatha Christie to indulge in American jokes like Funetik Aksent and Wacky Americans Have Wacky Names and Separated by a Common Language. That is, until the end, when he's revealed to be a Pinkerton agent tracking the jewel thief who is only part of a complicated mystery.
-   _Sherlock Holmes_:

-   Pinkerton agents figure in an episode of _Copper_. They are not portrayed in a positive light.
-   In _Damnation_, one of the main characters, Creeley Turner, is a pink who is let out of jail in order to end a farmer's strike led by his pinko brother.

-   In the HBO series _Deadwood_, the Pinkerton Agency and its agents are occasionally referred to by several of the show's characters, often ominously or with contempt. Even _Al Swearengren_ thinks they're below his admittedly low moral standards! Miss Isringhausen, Sofia's tutor from the show's second season, is eventually revealed to be an agent of the group.
-   On the _Ellery Queen_ episode "The Adventure of the Mad Tea Party", the victim's butler is an undercover Pinkerton, which doesn't stop him from being a suspect.
-   "The Ten Li'l Grifters Job," an episode of _Leverage_, featured the team infiltrating a murder mystery costume party and had Eliot costumed as Charlie Siringo, a real-life Pinkerton agent. Given his history as a retrieval specialist, bodyguard, occasional government operative, and mercenary who now helps take down the Corrupt Corporate Executive of the week (at least one of whom he worked _for_ in the past), the comparison is appropriate.
-   In Book Two of _North and South (U.S.)_, Orry Main enlists an ace Pinkerton detective to find his stray wife. Eventually, the gumshoe chafes at what is becoming a full-time assignment.
-   One of the main characters of the short lived series _Peacemakers_ (basically _CSI_ IN THE OLD WEST!) was a former Pinkerton agent. One episode also featured a legendary Pinkerton agent gone rogue as the perp.
-   _The Pinkertons_ naturally centers around these, featuring their founder Allan Pinkerton in the pilot, while one of the main characters is his son William. Incidentally the actor playing Pinkerton, Angus MacFadyen, has the same background as his character, both having been born in Glasgow, Scotland.
-   In the _Timeless_ episode "Mrs. Sherlock Holmes", the Lifeboat crew travels to 1919. When a cop confronts Rufus and Flynn at a crime scene, Rufus claims that they're Pinkerton detectives named John McClane and Hans Gruber. Flynn ruefully smiles at being given the name of the (European) bad guy. The cop then addresses them as a "couple of dicks", causing Rufus to take offense, only for Flynn to acknowledge that they're indeed a "couple of _detectives_".

    Newspaper Comics 

-   In the _Funky Winkerbean_ storyline in which Summer investigates the historic mystery surrounding silent comedy star "Butter" Brickle (which starts off looking like a No Celebrities Were Harmed "Fatty" Arbuckle, before going off in a completely bizarre direction), her interviewee, Cliff Anger, says the Pinkertons investigated, including Dashiel Hammett, but what they found wasn't conclusive.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Deadlands_, the Pinkertons are the original Men in Black organisation, eventually becoming the Agency. (Real Life Writes the Plot on this one: once the writers discovered that the Pinkerton agency was still around and active, although as a private security company, they wrote a name change Retcon to avoid legal issues).
-   Not actual Pinkertons in _Rocket Age_, but the Wolfgang & Long Detective Agency shares similarities with them, running investigations across the solar system for nations who can't readily reach criminals.

    Video Games 

-   Booker DeWitt, the protagonist of _BioShock Infinite_, is a former Pinkerton Agent who was apparently expelled from the organization due to "behavior beyond the acceptable bounds of the Agency".

-   _Red Dead Redemption II_ has Andrew Milton as one of the game's antagonists, who pursues the Van Der Linde gang. He does state that he's been seconded to the U.S. Government, but in reality, he's working for Leviticus Cornwall. Pinkerton Agents appear throughout the game as Mooks. The game also establishes that Edgar Ross was Milton's protégé before becoming a Bureau Of Investigation agent and he appears alongside Milton, rarely speaking until after Milton's death.
    -   Securitas AB attempted to sue Take-Two for royalties over the use of the Pinkerton name in _Red Dead Redemption 2_, but Take-Two filed a countersuit over "using trademark law to own the past" and Securitas dropped it.

    Real Life 

-   Dashiell Hammett, author of _Red Harvest_, _The Thin Man_, and _The Maltese Falcon_, was a Pinkerton detective. His experience working for the Pinkertons led him to develop communist sympathies, eventually getting involved in left-wing politics full-time later in life. Ironically, both Pinkertons and communist sympathizers are both known as "Pinks".<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
