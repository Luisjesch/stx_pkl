Getting postmodern with the trope?

**De Sardet:** Are you trying to blackmail me?  
**Aurélia De Vespe:** Oh what a horrid word! Come now, I would never do such a thing. Let's just say that I'm ensuring your loyalty.

This trope dates back to movies in the 1930s (and possibly earlier). A character discovers that she is the target of blackmail and confronts the blackmailer, who — while not denying their actions — would rather call it something prettier, like a "comprehensive insurance policy". The line is virtually stock dialogue now; as a trope, it is at the very least discredited. It was already being lampshaded in the '50s, and since then it's only used for laughs (or period flavor) these days.

Variations on the theme sometimes appear for other "ugly" words in various situations where the perpetrator can't or won't deny the substance of the accusation, but insists on softening it with a euphemism.

Many times, the character will claim that something is extortion instead of blackmail or vice versa. It appears that fictional characters are more comfortable admitting to that since "X" Makes Anything Cool.

According to free advice.com, extortion happens when someone gets money, property, or services through coercion, e.g.: threat of violence, destruction of property, improper government action, or withholding testimony. Blackmail is when a person threatens to reveal information about a victim or his family members that is potentially embarrassing, socially damaging, or incriminating unless a demand for money, property, or services is met. Even if the information is true or actually incriminating, a person can still be charged with blackmail if he or she threatens to reveal it unless the victim meets his or her demand.

## Examples using the word "Blackmail"

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Kurokochi_: the titular corrupt inspector blackmails every local politician because he knows their dirty secrets. However, he just mentions whatever secrets they have and acts as if his bribes were gifts, letting the politicians give the money of their own volition instead of forcing them to do it. It seems to work like a charm since he's wealthier than anyone in the police force.
-   In _Persona 5: The Animation_: Sojiro has an exchange like this for Youji Isshiki, Sojiro's adopted daughter Futaba's uncle. Youji had abused Futaba while she stayed with him, and had demanded that Sojiro pay him a large sum of money in exchange for Futaba's custody.
    
    **Sojiro:** So that's what you're after?! Using Futaba as a bargaining chip for money?  
    **Youji:** It's not good to assume things like that.
    
-   _Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs_: Due to his cohort of Impoverished Patrician noblemen classmates proving Fair-Weather Friend in the past, Leon blackmails them all by giving them free warships from his shipyard, that Leon threatens to cut off from repairs and resupply if they don't fight under him, terming it "Friendship". Should have Read the Fine Print.

    Comic Books 

-   In _2010_ story arc _Day of the Dollmaker_, Catherine Grant blackmails Lana Lang to get Supergirl to help her. When called out on it, Cat claims -pretty obtusely- that it was not blackmail.
    
    **Cat:** And I'm not blackmailing anyone. I merely asked Lana to ask her friend to help me.
    
-   Subverted in _Omaha the Cat Dancer_ when Joanne has incriminating info on some bad guys, but she will not specify what she wants for it right now. The potential recipient refuses to accept the info blind but is persuaded otherwise when Joanne tells him that the info would be damaging to his interests as well. When the man growls this is blackmail, Joanne remarks, "It's all blackmail, I'm just choosing sides."
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW)_: In #98, April warns Doctor Stockman she's got dirt on him, and it will be released publicly if anything bad happens to her, her family or her friends.
    
    **Doctor Stockman:** _"So it's blackmail, then? Extortion."_  
    **April:** _"I like to think of it as more of an insurance policy."_  
    **Doctor Stockman:** _"Semantics."_
    
-   _S.W.O.R.D_: Abigail Brand lets Gyrich know that his attempted coup of her organisation nearly led to Earth's destruction, she has all the evidence needed to prove it, and the only way she'll keep it to herself is if he quits and tells the higher-ups that she has no need of a co-command.
    
    **Gyrich:** This is blackmail.  
    **Brand:** I prefer "squeezing your unexplored hairy planetoids in a vise".
    

    Comic Strips 

-   In one early _Dilbert_ storyline, an abusive skunk shows up at Dilbert's doorstep.
    
    **Skunk:** Don't worry. Skunks only spray musk when scared.  
    **Dilbert:** Then why is your tail twitching?  
    **Skunk:** I'm scared you won't fix me a big bowl of strawberry ice cream.  
    **Dilbert:** This is blackmail!  
    **Skunk:** No it's not. I'm just easily frightened...Now I'm scared you won't sing the entire score from _Cats_ while I eat.
    

    Fan Works 

-   In _Blurring Reality_ Tom Riddle threatens to not dance in the Hogwarts year-end ballet unless Harry takes the role of the Hero, which would mean cancellation of the production and the loss of Fred and George's chance at a contract.
    
    **Harry:** You bastard, that's blackmail!  
    **Tom:** Not really. I'm just enforcing your guilt. It only works on certain people with a special kind of conscience.
    
-   _The Fifth House_:
    
    **Harry:** Hermione reads romance novels? Seriously? You know, this is going to be used against you. I shall tease you mercilessly!  
    **Hermione:** Are you threatening to blackmail me?  
    **Harry:** Such an ugly word, blackmail. Think of it more as incentive, to do my homework. For the rest of our stay here at lovely Hogwarts.
    
-   _Harry Potter and the Shadowed Light_:
    
    **Ragnok:** \[Rita Skeeter's\] stories never say what you want them to - she’s unreliable.  
    **Harry:** Ah, but I know how to make her do exactly what I want.  
    **Ragnok:** Blackmail?  
    **Harry:** I’d prefer ‘persuasive handling’.
    
-   _Harry Potter - Three to Backstep_:
    
    **Harry:** Still, it seemed to almost be like I was pretty much blackmailing them.  
    **Daphne:** What some call blackmailing, others call politicking in backroom deals.
    
-   _HERZ_: Subverted. The Chinese Government tried to build its own Eva in a top-secret facility. The monster went out of control, obliterated the facility and started to rampage through China. A Chinese commanding officer pleaded Misato dispatching her Evas. She retorted she would deploy them… in exchange for information on where the other Evas were being built. When the officer complained about it being blackmail, her reaction was "So what?"
    
    **Commander Hai:** This is an emergency. Many lives are at stake. Your charter allows for action now.  
    **Misato:** Indeed.  
    **\[...\]**  
    **Commander Hai:** What is your price?  
    **Misato:** Information. On where the other Evas are being built. All of them.  
    **Commander Hai:** You can't expect us to know all that. And what makes you think..  
    **Misato:** ..that you would know? \[...\] That thing was built in Lop Nor. Using technology from SEELE and Chinese military resources. I'm sure this will be an interesting revelation before the UN Organs and the world media...  
    **Commander Hai:** That's blackmail!  
    **Misato:** I'm also perfectly happy to let this thing continue its grand tour through your heartland and population centres. I don't have to do anything until the UN to get its paperwork done or until it reaches Japan itself...
    
-   From _Looming Darkness_ we have Dark Link quoting this almost word for word in chapter 9.
-   _The New Adventures of Invader Zim_: Early in Season 2, Zim attempts to coerce Gaz into serving him by threatening to expose how she betrayed Dib at the end of Season 1. When Gaz incredulously asks for confirmation that he's actually trying to blackmail _her_, he smugly says that blackmail is a "nasty" word, but confirms that he is. Things only get worse for him from there.
-   The _My Hero Academia_ fanfic _Throw a Chair Through a Window and Call It a Day_ has Midoriya be a user of this under the impression that it makes them sounds less intimidating. He first renames "psychological warfare" to "a slight emotional manipulation of peers", and later calls an interrogation "a slightly more intense and focused interview".
    -   When informed that giving alternate names to things makes them _more_ intimidating and not less, he tries renaming psychological warfare to "extremely thorough observations and control over a friend's mental state and functions".
-   In _An Unepic Pony War In The Nondistant Future_, to keep Shining from taking sides in her little war with Cadance, Twilight writes him a letter threatening him with humiliating pictures (though they would be equally humiliating to her) and ends it with:
    
    Postscript: Brother, blackmail is such an ugly word
    
-   In _When Reason Fails_, according to Shoto, "blackmail" is too negative. He prefers "aggressive persuasion techniques".
-   The _Family Guy_ fanfic _Wipe The Slate Clean_ has this mild subversion on the trope, between Brian and Stewie when Stewie plans to blackmail Brian:
    
    **Brian:** So... it's blackmail, is it?  
    **Stewie:** Blackmail _is_ such an ugly word. How about the word "extortion"?  
    **Brian:** Extortion's a good word.  
    **Stewie:** But unfortunately completely inaccurate. Extortion is when I just... _beat you until you give me what I want!_  
    _(Stewie pulls out a baseball bat and starts whacking Brian on the back and shins)_  
    **Brian:** Damn! Ow! Stop that! Okay, okay, blackmail it is!
    
    -   It is also a shout-out to every show that ever said blackmail was interchangeable with extortion — and by this page, you can see there are quite a number of them.
-   _With Confidence_: When Izuku confronts the Principal with ample evidence of how the school not only turned a blind eye to the bullying he received for being quirkless, but actively _encouraged_ it for years, he declares that something can only be called blackmail if the person being threatened _knows_ that their actions were unethical and illegal. As Principal Akashi would prefer feigning ignorance, well... he'll play along with that, provided that those mistakes are _corrected_ moving forward.
-   Inverted in a chapter of _X-Men: The Early Years_ where blackmailed Warren uses euphemisms and blackmailer Scott tells him to call it what it is.
    
    **Warren:** Okay, okay. I'll go get my keys. Though I don't know why I'm so nice to you two.  
    **Scott:** _(rolling eyes)_ I believe you being nice had nothing to do with it. If I remember correctly, the word you're looking for is blackmail. Oh, yes it's coming back to me now. Something about you gluing Professor Xavier's favorite pipe back together. You broke it and I caught you gluing it with Hank's special glue in the kitchen.  
    **Warren:** Blackmail is such an ugly little word and so harsh. We are going to get so much mileage out of this from Bobby. I think I'm going to have him wash my car first. I'll come up with something more humiliating later.
    

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Turning Red_, Tyler tells Mei that he has done her a "favour" by not telling her mother about her hustling of her panda form and views blackmailing her into attending his birthday party as asking for a favour back.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Played straight in _The Bad and the Beautiful_.

-   In _Bedtime Story (1964)_, Freddy stops his general from disciplining him by reminding that if he does, his inability to curb Freddy's rampant misbehavior will be exposed. He says, "'Blackmail' is such an ugly word, sir. Couldn't we use the word 'persuasion'?"
-   Chad in _Burn After Reading_ blackmails an ex CIA agent for money, but sees himself as a "Good Samaritan" rather than what he really is.
-   _Burn Notice: The Fall of Sam Axe_:
    
    **Admiral Gregory Maitland:** That's blackmail!  
    **Sam Axe:** No, actually, sir, I believe this form of extortion is known as _greymail_. It's much nicer than blackmail.
    
-   _Death of a Cyclist_: When Maria says the Spanish word for "blackmail"—_chantaje_—Rafa sneers "That's such an ugly word, and not even Castilian." This is a sneaky reference to dictator Francisco Franco's insistence that the Spanish film industry exclusively use pure Castilian Spanish.
-   _Dial M for Murder_
    
    **Tony:** I was hoping sooner or later I might catch you at something and be able to...  
    **Lesgate:** Blackmail me?  
    **Tony:** _Influence_ you.
    
-   Inverted in _Downstairs_.

    **Karl:** That's just the word I was trying to remember.
    
-   In the film _Edge of Tomorrow_, Major Cage attempts to extort General Brigham rather than fight the aliens. It nets him a bust to private and put right on the front lines.
    
    **General Brigham:** Are you blackmailing me, major?  
    **Cage:** I would prefer...not to be filming acts of heroism and valor on that beach tomorrow.
    
-   Inverted in _Entrapment_, where Gin is shown the evidence of her theft of the Rembrandt by Mac. She claims it's "entrapment". Mac counters that entrapment is when a cop does this to a thief. When a thief does it to another thief, it's just blackmail. Then it turns out that Mac is an FBI informant.
-   Hilariously subverted in _It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World_:
    
    **Chief Aloysius:** _(on the phone with the mayor)_ Now you know the word for this your Honor: it's called blackmail!
    
-   In _Kind Hearts and Coronets_, Louis sees through one of Sibella's schemes: "Not only are you trying to blackmail me — an ugly word, but the right one, I think — but you're trying to bluff me as well."
-   From _The Loved One_:
    
    **Joyboy:** That's blackmail!  
    **Dennis:** My dear sir, blackmail is not a word to be bandied about by gentlemen.
    
-   Played straight in the Stanley Kubrick film _Paths of Glory_.
-   Inverted in _Tenet_:
    
    **Protagonist:** If you and I were to make an arrangement…  
    **Kat:** An arrangement? You mean blackmail? You can’t be afraid of the word.
    
-   Inverted for great effect in _They Call Me Trinity_ when the title character threatened to tell people his brother wasn't a real sheriff.
    
    **Bambino:** That sounds like blackmail.  
    **Trinity:** Yeah, it does.
    
-   A variation in _TRON_: When Alan Bradley asks Kevin Flynn if he's using his hacking into the ENCOM computer system for embezzling, Flynn says that embezzling is such an ugly word and instead points out that his hacking into the system is to gather evidence that Ed Dillinger was stealing from his work.
-   Subverted in _You Only Live Twice_ considering whatever Blofeld thinks of the word, blackmail, its closely related term, extortion, is fine with him with as the essence of his business.

    Literature 

-   _Adrian Mole_ uses this phrase in _The Wilderness Years_, when he has been sworn to secrecy about an affair between Brown and Megan.
    
    God, blackmail is an ugly word. I hope Brown doesn't force me to use it.
    
-   The novel _And Heres To You_ by Brian "Arkle" Webber has main female character Alicia Mitchell use this exact line on a co-worker at an office party. Partially Justified by the character's internal monologue revealing that she was directly quoting Bender from _Futurama_ when she did so.
-   Subverted in Ayn Rand's _Atlas Shrugged_:
    
    Rearden said calmly, "In my youth, this was called blackmail."  
    Dr. Ferris grinned. "That's what it is, Mr. Rearden. We've entered a much more realistic age."
    
-   Terl of _Battlefield Earth_ has an obsession with finding "leverage" over his opponents that rivals J. Edgar Hoover.
-   Averted in the _Conrad Stargard_ series by Leo Frankowski. When Count Lambert tries to force Conrad Stargard into an Arranged Marriage with his daughter, Conrad erupts, "But this is filthy, rotten blackmail!" Count Lambert replies, "Yes it is, isn't it."
-   Inverted in _The Culture_ novel _The Player of Games_. The protagonist is blackmailed by a drone and the drone actually says something like "What I'm doing to you is called blackmail." Presumably, since The Culture is a utopia, the protagonist might not actually know what blackmail is. Alternatively, the trope's being invoked: the protagonist is a games theorist very used to concepts of threat and leverage, and the drone is relying on emotional emphasis to sell its (objectively poor) position and catch the protagonist at another weak moment. Out-of-universe, it's arguably a subtle bit of foreshadowing.
-   _Fifty Shades of Grey_: When Christian Grey does it, he prefers to call it "leverage". And he's not averse to doing things to create "leverage" such as (threatening to) rape people in public. Seriously, whenever he offers you something and then asks you to use it, don't deny him in any way, shape or form. Ever.
-   In _The Final Reflection_, Krenn attends an interstellar peace conference as part of his home planet's delegation. A Rigellian delegate attempts to sway Krenn's delegation with an offer of substantial "administrative expenses", and protests when Krenn prefers to call it "bribery".
-   _Going Clear_ states that L. Ron Hubbard didn't consider his practice of gathering the embarrassing secrets of his followers through the "Auditing" process and then holding it over their heads to be blackmail. In his mind, blackmail was done to extract money from people. He was extracting obedience.

-   In _Hullo Russia, Goodbye England_, the pilots of Britain's nuclear deterrent strike jets are vulnerable to blackmail. The Russian spy who attempts to compromise Flight-Lieutenant Silk over his affair describes what he does as "working for the Press", the implication being that if Silk does not play nicely, his MP wife will be embarrassed by his affair becoming common knowledge. Especially since Silk is paying cash to the lady for "cello lessons". A local bookie also threatens to go to the CO if another pilot's gambling debts are not paid in full, and "have a concerned discussion as to his little problem. You can't have a man with a gambling problem in charge of nuclear weapons, can you? It's my **public duty**."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In the Tamora Pierce novel _Lady Knight_, Kel has decided to commit treason to save refugees and is angered when she finds people willing to help — they'll get charged, same as her. One of them teasingly says she won't get to use the potentially very helpful maps he brought unless they come with her.
    
    "That's blackmail," Kel said through a thick piece of bacon.  
    "Actually, it's extortion." That was Lofren, whose father was a magistrate. "Blackmail implies—"  
    His squad-mates dragged him to his feet and took him to saddle their mounts. Kel was grateful. Lofren was happy to talk about matters of law at length, in detail, to anyone who would listen.
    
-   Inverted — very strangely — in Hugh Laurie's novel _The Gun Seller_:
    
    "You followed me here."  
    "Tut. Followed is such an ugly word. I prefer 'blackmail'."  
    "What?"  
    "But, of course, it means something completely different. So all right, let's say I followed you here."
    
-   In _Lolita_, Humbert corrects himself when fantasizing on how he will "blackmail" his wife Charlotte into letting him spend more time with Lolita, saying that "blackmail" is too harsh and suggesting "mauvemail" as a lighter term.
-   Variant: In the _Lord Darcy_ novel _Too Many Magicians_, when the Marquis of London pressures Darcy to take a case, Master Sean calls it blackmail:
    
    "'Blackmail' is perhaps too strong a word," Lord Darcy said thoughtfully, "but I will admit that no other is quite strong enough."
    
    -   To clarify, it isn't blackmail: the Marquis isn't threatening to expose any information, to seek any incriminating information, or in fact to do _anything_. And the Marquis is stopping short of actual villainy; while circumstantial evidence threatens an innocent man close to Lord Darcy with a murder conviction, and the Marquis is far too intelligent for his professed satisfaction with the current investigation to be genuine, if pushed far enough he wouldn't really let this stand. The never-stated issue here is entirely who will do the work and whose pocket the expenses of investigation will come out of. Thus the quote.
-   Lord Peter Wimsey himself engages in a little blackmail in one of the short stories, but he would of course not use that word.
-   In _The Many Mysteries of the Finkel Family_, Lara is annoyed when Benny accuses her of spying on people. She prefers "investigating."
-   Eric Idle's _Rutland Dirty Weekend Book_ contains a letter to critics in which Idle explicitly states they will be paid bribes for a good review of the book, and subject to physical violence for a bad review, and notes that blackmail is an ugly word, "but in this case, it's also a very accurate one."
-   Abe Mazur from _Vampire Academy_, never blackmails. "It's much easier if people simply see reason..."

-   _Burn Notice_ has the occasional use, as spies use plenty of doublespeak. One episode has Jesse convincing a target to follow Michael's plan, or some information is getting to the media.
    
    **Wayne Meyerson:** Wait. Are you _blackmailing_ me?  
    **Jesse:** Yeah. But... let's not call it that. Let's call it 'a potential win-win'.
    
-   In _Diff'rent Strokes_, Arnold gets into a fight with the bullying son of the landlord's brother who is subbing for a short time. This leads to a loud confrontation where the brother confronts Mr. Drummond, threatens to evict the family and provokes Drummond to punch the blowhard out. Later, the Landlord comes to the Drummonds saying that he approved of his dumb brother being put in his place. However, he also exploits a lease violation that the brother found to raise the rent on the Drummonds, with a veiled threat of eviction to convince them to give in. When Drummond protests that this is blackmail, the landlord responds "I prefer to think of it as plea bargaining". The punchline is after the Drummonds cave in to this threat, the father tells the kids that this is the result of his act of violence. However, when asked if it was worth it, Mr. Drummond immediately remarks it was for having the pleasure of shutting a bully up.
-   In the _Doctor Who_ story "Logopolis", the Master manages to accidentally unleash an entropy field which destroys a _quarter_ of the universe, simply because he didn't fully understand the consequences of interfering with the titular planet's mysterious operation.

    **Bodie:** That's a very coarse way of putting it!  
    **Doyle:** _(laughs)_ Oh, you mean there's another way?  
    **Bodie:** _(in posh accent)_ Yes, I prefer "interrogation", "investigation" on account of the fact that I'm very conscientious about my work.
    
-   In _The Rockford Files_ episode "The Empty Frame", Angel tells his brother-in-law "When it's in the immediate family it's not called blackmail. It's called family spirit."

"Collateral" has to be something that would be personally damaging if it were to be made public. Nude pictures and videos were apparently common, but the "collateral" doesn't even need to be true; Sarah states she was videoed making allegations against her husband and family, including that her husband was abusing their son. Any attempt to leave DOS or refuse the orders of your Master is backed by the threat of releasing your collateral. "Collateral" is the most-often used term to describe this, only when some extra punch is needed do they call it what it is: blackmail.
-   _Yes, Minister_ gave us a version of this, when the black, male revolutionary leader of a small African nation threatens to give a strongly nationalist speech in Scotland unless the Government gives him £50 million (around $115 million in 1980, when that episode aired).

-   Lampshaded and subverted on _Greg the Bunny_:
    
    **Leo:** ... and I thought, what a coincidence! Your show is hiring a Singing Mailman and I... have your dirty tape?  
    **Dottie Sunshine:** You're blackmailing me?  
    **Leo:** _(as Jack Nicholson)_ Blackmail is such a dirty word.  
    **Leo:** _(as himself)_ Jack Nicholson, _Chinatown._ And yes.
    

    Radio 

-   A spoof of this trope, from the British radio series _I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again_:
    
    **John (Cleese):** So... it's blackmail, is it?  
    **Graeme (Garden) :** Please. Blackmail is such an ugly word.  
    **John:** All right. How about... _fishpaste_?  
    **Graeme:** Much better.  
    **John:** So... it's fishpaste, is it?  
    **Graeme:** I'm afraid so.
    
-   Lampshaded in _Round the Horne_:
    
    **Kenneth Horne:** "This is blackmail!"  
    **Kenneth Williams:** "Call it what you will!"  
    **Horne:** Alright, this is "iff-eff-iquana", and "iff-eff-iquana" is an ugly word!

    **Tassiter:** Oh, go to hell, John.
    
-   _Metal Gear Solid_:
    
    **Snake:** So, you're blackmailing me?  
    **Col. Campbell:** I prefer to think of it as helping to make you come to a decision more easily.
    
-   Humorously averted in _The Outer Worlds_:
    
    **Player:** Are you suggesting extortion?  
    **Silas:** _That's_ the word! "Extortion"! Been on the tip of my tongue all day.
    
-   _Quest for Glory V_ gives us this exchange:
    
    **Arestes:** Watch yer backside, matey. Blackmail is a very risky profession.  
    **Ugarte:** Blackmail, me? I would not put it quite so crudely as blackmail. I prefer to think of it as, say, keeping a secret. I am very careful with my secrets.
    

    Visual Novels 

-   _Galaxy Angel_: In Milfeulle's route in the second game, she gets Noah to cooperate by offering her some food as a token of friendship, and Noah agrees to talk about what she knows if she's given more. Tact calls her a "mercenary", to which Noah replies she'd rather be called an "utilitarian".

    **Mom:** Come on, Rie, Licia's eating her natto~ You don't want to lose to Licia, do you?  
    **Rie:** It's a competition?  
    **Mom:** Of course it is. I'm going to give you affection points throughout the day, based on your behavior. Who knows? If you earn over twenty affection points, I might even give you an autograph~  
    **Rie:** That's called blackmail, Mom.
    

    Webcomics 

-   In _Buck Godot: Zap Gun for Hire_, there is an inversion where the blackmailer, Buck, attempts to soften the situation but the victim is having none of it.
    
    **Buck:** Call it peace of mind.  
    **Vree:** I'll call it blackmail and pay it if it gets you out of my embassy.
    
    -   There is a subversion, also with Vree, near the end of the comic as well.
        
        **Etarre:** Why, I'm sure you'll give us such wonderful trade terms, I'll forget all about it \[the sensitive information\]!  
        **Vree:** But- But that's BLACKMAIL!  
        **Etarre:** Oh wonderful, we understand each other perfectly!
        
-   _Exterminatus Now_ has a wonderful scene:
    
    **Lothar:** You're blackmailing someone, aren't you?  
    **Virus:** _(with hurt expression)_ We prefer the term "extortion".  
    **Eastwood:** Hey, it's not _our_ fault if Commander Schaefer leaves videos of his secret chicken fetish lying around. _Anybody_ could've broken into his apartment and found them.
    
-   _Goats_, here:
    
    **Scroggs:** Blackmail is such a negative term. Let's call it Proactive Synergy Reallocation.  
    **Ix:** Let's call it Susan. Ix always like that name.
    
-   _Hero Oh Hero_ inverts this:
    
    **Archibald (The Iron Judge):** You are on thin ice, foreigner. I'd suggest you quit provoking me.  
    **Guy:** Provoking? That's cute, Archie, really cute. I think the word you're looking for is _blackmail_.
    
-   Played entirely straight in this _Narbonic_ strip. There's a slight twist, in that due to Artie's self-image as "the good one", he's trying to convince _himself_ what he's planning isn't blackmail.
-   In _Schlock Mercenary_, regarding menacing the Sol system with the PDCL:
    
    **Kevyn:** That wasn't blackmail. That was, I don't know... passive extortion?
    
-   From _Soap on a Rope_:
    
    **Max:** Joe, you're blackmailing people!  
    **Joe:** "Blackmail" is such a negative term. I prefer "mail of color".
    

    Web Original 

-   In _Final Fantasy VII: Machinabridged_, after the residents of Junon learn that Cloud's party is Shinra's most wanted fugitives:
    
    **Old Man:** I think it would be in your best interests to wait at the inn, until our leader is ready to speak with you.  
    **Barret:** And if we don't?  
    **Old Man:** Then I'll just have a word with Shinra instead.  
    **Barret:** Oh my god, are you blackmailing us?!  
    **Old Man:** Just think of it as "involuntary volunteering."  
    **Yuffie:** As long as you're not extorting us!  
    **Barret:** Oh my god, why are you here?
    
-   When Ayla and Jadis confront some would-be extortionists in the _Whateley Universe_:
    
    **Jadis:** Ooh. That sounds like blackmail. And blackmail is such an ugly word.  
    **Ayla:** I prefer "intentional torts". At least it sounds like some deliberately tasty desserts.
    
    -   Given that not only did they both already know that the 'evidence' being held over them was a particularly absurd case of Out-of-Context Eavesdropping, but also that the would-be blackmailer had inadvertently triggered a plan of Ayla's that left _three_ different groups of opponents Out-Gambitted and put one of them under his thumb, a certain smugness was understandable.
-   In the aftermath of accusations that CNN threatened to DOX a Reddit user if he posted hateful messages again, CNN clarified that this wasn't their intention and was merely trying to state they made no deal with the Reddit user in question. At least one forum poster pointed out that CNN wasn't helping its case because claiming that you don't like to think of what you're doing is blackmail is the first thing anyone says when they blackmail you.

    Western Animation 

-   _Futurama_, "Anthology of Interest I":
    
    **Bender:** There's nothing wrong with murder. Just as long as you let Bender wet his beak.  
    **Leela:** You're blackmailing me?  
    **Bender:** Blackmail is such an ugly word. I prefer extortion. The "X" makes it sound cool.
    
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)_, "Michelangelo Meets Mondo Gecko"
    
    **Mr. X:** Blackmail is such an ugly word. I prefer ripoff.
    

## Examples of a different Ugly Word

    Anime & Manga 

-   From _FAKE_:
    
    **Dee:** So you are in cahoots with Berkeley after all, aren't you? I knew something was up.  
    **Diana:** Awww, cahoots is such a mean, ugly word. We're more like childhood friends, if anything. Swear to God.
    
-   From _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_:
    -   In Episode 9, "Be Thou For the People":
        
        **Ed:** _(having just received a small pouch of gold from Lieutenant Yoki)_ This supposed to be some kind of a bribe, Yoki?  
        **Yoki:** That is such an ugly word. Why don't we just call it "equivalent exchange"?
        
    -   And then later in the same episode:
        
        **Yoki:** No! You swindled me!  
        **Ed:** That's such an ugly word. Why don't we call it "A gift from you to me"?
        
-   _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_: When Miu realizes that Rimi's shoes have gold soles, she outright states her intentions to beat her up and take her shoes as prize, intending to sell them for money. When she's called out on that being stealing, she calls it "spoils of war".
-   _One Piece_: Since slavery is technically illegal, the World Government refer to the Celestial Nobles' human auction halls as "employment assistance offices". Not that it fools anybody.

    Comic Books 

-   _Joker's Asylum: The Riddler_:
    
    **Jessica Duchamp:** The painting. You're stealing it.  
    **Riddler:** "Stealing" is such an unpleasant word. I prefer "acquiring". It's much more aesthetically pleasing to the tongue.
    
-   Used by Countess Invidia in _Les Légendaires: Origins_:
    
    **Kasino:** You want to.... _murder_ Jadina?  
    **Invidia:** Oh, let's not use such words! I am merely talking about luring her in a situation that will result in her death.  
    **Kasino:** THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING!
    
-   In a _Peanuts_ strip where Linus brings flowers to his teacher, Charlie Brown tells him he won't get anywhere with bribery. Linus prefers the term "pump priming".

    Comic Strips 

-   In a _Dilbert_ Sunday Strip, the Pointy-Haired Boss confronts Alice for having made personal calls on the job (to tell her family she was working late), saying it's "like stealing from the company." After handing him a dollar to more than cover the phone bill, she presents him with her own bill for "$40,000 in unpaid overtime that the company stole from me."
    
    **Pointy-Haired Boss:** That's not stealing; that's being competitive.  
    **Alice:** I think I'll be competitive with a few bushels of office supplies later today.
    

    Fan Works 

-   Nilvac and Sebboh, from _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_, react this way to being called "evil". They prefer "dark".
-   In _Candy For Your Thoughts?_, when Alejandro is trying to convince Gwen to manipulate Cody:
    
    **Gwen:** You want me to _lie_ to Cody?  
    **Alejandro:** Lying us such a strong word. I prefer flirting to your own advantage.
    
-   _Goin' KABOOM!_: Vlad doesn't like the use of the word "slave" to describe what he's doing to Katie. He prefers "to call it an unpaid internship and gaining a long term errand girl".
-   In _He's Not Dead Yet_ Harry plans to get Snape to violate the restraining order he's currently under.
    
    **Neville:** Lord Potter, I would be delighted to join in your pursuit of vengeance.  
    **Harry:** No, Neville, not vengeance. That is such an ugly word. Call it 'payback.'
    
-   _Losing Control_:
    
    **Cedric:** Merlin Daph, you sound like you want to overthrow the government.  
    **Daphne:** Overthrow is such a strong word. How about modernize and make more effective. The more people we have that think like us, the easier it will be.
    
-   _Once Upon a Time in 1917_:
    
    **Edward:** You bribed a nun?  
    **Elizabeth Masen:** No, dear, I made a donation to the poor.
    
-   _Our Blades Are Sharp_ has a traveling Tyrion and Jon Snow happening on a crowded inn.
    
    **Jon:** Mayhaps, we should try elsewhere?  
    **Tyrion:** You forget who you're traveling with, a crowded inn is no problem for a Lannister.  
    **Jon:** You mean to swindle someone out of their room? Like Lann the Clever with Casterly Rock.  
    **Tyrion:** You know my family's history. And swindle is such an ugly word. I prefer convincing with a slight edge. And this is hardly Casterly Rock.
    
-   When Ash confronts Sabrina in _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, he calls her out on her murdering innocent people just for considering them "unremarkable". She replies that "it's more akin to weeding than murder". Also, turns out that she stole from a Pokémon Coordinator the use of Psycho Cut with a Kadabra's spoons to create Laser Blades, and she insists that she didn't "plagiarize" the move, but learned it legitimately.
-   In _Potter, Inverted_ Sirius shows off by interpreting Lina's coat of arms.
    
    **Sirius:** Sable; a chevron inverted and indented vert, in base a dragon... er... tué, I suppose, gules; over all a sword inverted or... Um... that would be... constancy, faithful service and a love of fire; enlightened warrior - I suppose that means a combat mage, in our case - plus two references to your surname; and a defender of treasure... no wait, the dragon's dead, so... you're actually **advertising** that you're a thief?  
    **Lina:** I prefer 'asset recovery specialist'.
    
-   _Son of Morgaine_:
    
    **Ariana's ghost:** I thought you'd have loved to spend some time with your darling sister. Aberforth loves to talk to me.  
    **Dumbledore:** Yes, but you don't torture him, do you?  
    **Ariana's ghost:** Torture is such an ugly word. I prefer amuse.
    
-   _Thief is such a harsh word, Harry_:
    
    **Blaise:** You're a thief Draco-  
    **Draco:** Thief is such a harsh word. I see myself as a modern day Robin Hood. You're my merry men, and I'm your heroic leader.
    
-   _Thousand Shinji_: When Shinji seizes a firm, an employee accuses him from "looting" them. Shinji takes offense to the term "loot".
    
    **Shiro:** You ruined us just to loot us, didn’t you?  
    **Shinji:** Loot is such a pejorative term. I prefer the phrase ‘hostile takeover with extreme prejudice’.
    
-   The _Bleach_ fanfic _Uninvited Guest_, when it is claimed that Yumokin is being murdered rather than sacrificing his own life, he says "Murder is such a harsh word. Accurate, but harsh."
-   This example comes up in _The Vow_ about Lord Shen's methods to enforce obedience from the citizens of Gongmen City.

    Films — Animation 

-   In sequels to _Aladdin_, it's nearly Iago's catchphrase to say "Hate/traitor is such a strong word".
-   In _Atlantis: The Lost Empire,_ Milo accuses Rourke and the crew of being mercenaries.
    
    **Rourke:** Mercenary? I prefer the term "adventure capitalist."
    
    -   Considering he outright describes himself and his crew as mercenaries just a few scenes later, it's likely he was just _mocking_ Milo's naivete.
-   While it was used _in_ blackmail, in _Batman and Harley Quinn_, Batman lords knowledge that many A.R.G.U.S. agents, including Sarge Steel, have frequented a brothel that caters to the BDSM crowd over Steel's own head to force cooperation. Steel himself responses by claiming in many countries, the reason for his visits would be considered "therapy". That said, this is an instance of both types as Bruce himself does calls it an "exchange" when Steel calls him out on the tactic.
-   From _The Boss Baby:_ "'Hate' is a strong word. It's the right word, but still."
-   In the _Lucky Luke_ movie _Go West !_, the villain, Mr Crook, keeps being called "a crook" by everybody. His answer? "Come on, that's a bit too harsh a word !". <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Ratatouille_: Django insists to Rémy that their scavenging garbage for food is acceptable practice, since "It's not stealing if nobody wants it."
-   _Robin Hood (1973)_:
    
    **Little John:** You know sump'n, Robin, I was just wonderin' — are we good guys or bad guys? You know, I mean, uh, our robbin' the rich to feed the poor...  
    **Robin Hood:** "Rob?" Tsk tsk tsk tsk — that's a naughty word; we never "rob." We just... sort of borrow a bit from those who can afford it.  
    **Little John:** "_Borrow?_" Huh. Boy, are we in debt!
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Accepted_:
    
    **Bartleby Gaines:** Eh, Stalking's an ugly word. I prefer obsessively shadowing.
    
-   _Back to the Future_:
    -   In _Back to the Future Part II_, Doc "borrows" some old newspapers from the closed-down Hill Valley Library in 1985-A.
    -   In _Back to the Future Part III_, as Doc Brown is unveiling his plan of returning Marty back 1985 (as he went to 1885 to presumably rescue Doc), he starts to say "We're going to hijack...", before freezing, immediately correcting himself and placing emphasis on new terminology with a wide, toothy grin, "_**BORROW**_... the locomotive..." Later, when the _**borrowing**_ is taking place, the conductor asks if it's a hold-up. Doc responds that "it's a science experiment."
-   An odd variation occurs in _The Blues Brothers_ when Elwood admits that he hasn't kept track of the old band as well as he said he did while Jake was in prison. The odd part is whether or not Elwood's choice of words is better than Jake's.
    
    **Elwood:** Well, what was I gonna do? Take away your only hope? Take away the very thing that kept you going in there? I took the liberty of bullshitting you, okay?  
    **Jake:** You lied to me.  
    **Elwood:** It wasn't a lie, it was just...bullshit.
    
-   _Chinatown_:
    
    **Gittes:** She was cheating on him. Were you?  
    **Mrs. Mulwray:** I dislike the word "cheat".  
    **Gittes:** Did you have affairs?  
    **Mrs. Mulwray:** _Mr. Gittes_.
    
-   In _The Freshman (1990)_, in a variant of this trope, the following dialogue occurs near the end:
    
    **Clark:** So this whole thing as been a scam?  
    **Carmine:** This is an ugly word, 'scam.' This is business. If you want to be in business, this is what you do.
    
-   From the Vietnam War documentary _In the Year of the Pig_:
    
    **Senator Thruston B. Morton:** We've put over three million of them into what I would call a concentration camp. They call it a "refugee center".
    
-   _Jurassic Park_ has an inversion with this line:

**Ian Malcolm**: What you call discovery, I call the rape of the natural world.

-   _Kong: Skull Island_: Brooks dislikes hearing the seismic charges they're going to drop on Skull Island described as bombs. He calls them "scientific instruments".

**Slivko:** You hear that, boys? We're scientists now!  
_\[Soldiers laugh\]_

-   _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_: when Quatermain is introduced to Nemo, he refers to him as a "pirate".
-   _North By Northwest_ begins with a scene of Roger Thornhill stealing a taxicab for himself and his secretary, Maggie, by falsely telling the man who hailed it that she's "a very sick woman".
    
    **Maggie:** (_after the cab takes off_) Poor man.  
    **Thornhill:** I made him a happy man. I made him feel like a good Samaritan.  
    **Maggie:** He knew you were lying.  
    **Thornhill:** Maggie, in the world of advertising, there's no such thing as a lie; there's only the expedient exaggeration. You know that.
    
-   In _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl_, Will & Jack have this exchange:
    
    **Will:** We're going to steal a ship? \[looks at the _Dauntless_\] _That_ ship?  
    **Jack:** _Commandeer_; nautical term. We're going to commandeer..._that_ ship. \[points at the _Interceptor_\]
    
-   In _The Rocketeer_, once it's revealed that Neville Sinclair is actually a Nazi spy:
    
    **Jenny:** Everything you told me was a lie.  
    **Neville:** It wasn't lies, Jenny, it was acting.
    
-   From _Spider-Man_:
    
    **Peter:** Spider-Man wasn't trying to attack the city... he was trying to save it! That's slander.  
    **Jameson:** It is _not!_ I resent that! (_beat_) Slander is spoken. In print, it's libel.
    
-   Spock does this frequently with the word 'lie' in the _Star Trek_ movies.
    -   _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_, when Spock reveals that "Hours would seem like days" was a code:
        
        **Saavik:** You lied.  
        **Spock:** I exaggerated.
        
    -   _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_:
        
        -   After Spock opts not to inform Starfleet of their plan to rescue Kirk from Rura Penthe:
        
        **Valeris:** A lie?  
        **Spock:** An omission.
        
        -   Which becomes an Ironic Echo when Valeris refuses to give the names of her fellow conspirators:
            
            **Valeris:** I do not remember.  
            **Spock:** A lie.  
            **Valeris:** A choice.
            
    -   _Star Trek (2009)_, during Spock's meeting with Spock Prime:
        
        **Spock:** How did you persuade him to keep your secret?  
        **Spock Prime:** He inferred that universe-ending paradoxes would ensue should he break his promise.  
        **Spock:** You lied.  
        **Spock Prime:** I... implied.

    Literature 

## By Author:

-   David Eddings uses this several times in his various book series. Silk is the patron saint of this trope.

## By Title:

-   From _An Acceptable Time:_
    
    **Polly:** You let that man kidnap me.  
    **Zachary:** Oh, sweet Pol, don’t call it that. They made it very clear to me that the healer wouldn’t come near me if I didn’t bring the goddess to them.
    
-   In _Artemis Fowl_, Artemis discovers that Mulch has been lurking around Fowl Manor to steal things.
    
    **Mulch:** _Lurking_ is not a nice word. Makes me sound like a sea serpent. I like to think I was hiding in the shadows. Cool, like a cat burglar.  
    **Artemis:** You eat cats, Mulch.
    
-   _Discworld_: Reacher Gilt, anticipating his co-conspirators' thought processes in _Going Postal_, contemptuously muses that (at least for them) "embezzlement" is such a _difficult_ word.
-   _The Door into Summer_:
    
    **Dan:** Well, first, which one of you cooked up the swindle? Or did you plan it together?  
    **Miles:** That's an ugly word, Dan. I don't like it.
    
-   _Dragonlance_: Kenders use to "borrow" other people's personal belongings (or just picked it up, or just wanted to have a look at it ...)
-   _The Dresden Files_: Informed by Harry Dresden that there've been two attempts on Harry's life since he was hired to follow him, a private investigator opts to discontinue his assignment, remarking that "accomplice" is an ugly word, as is "penitentiary".
-   In the _Star Trek_ novel _The Final Reflection_, a Rigellian diplomat tries to sway the Klingon protagonist Captain Krenn at a summit by discussing vast sums of money... Krenn simply states that "Klingons do not believe in bribery," to which the diplomat replies, "That's a _terrible_ word to use for — administrative expenses."
-   In the novel _Foundation's Triumph_, the Three Laws-Compliant robots must use this type of phrasing when they tell human mentallics it may be necessary to seriously harm Hari Seldon to stop what they view as another robot group's interference.
    
    "It may become necessary..."  
    "To kill?"  
    "Persuade."  
    "But it is deeply embedded within Hari. To change it may cause him serious harm."  
    (Beat) The robot said "Regrettable." Then it croaked out "Necessary..." and left the room.
    
-   In _The Hobbit_, Glóin tells Bilbo, "You can say 'Expert Treasure-hunter' instead of 'Burglar' if you like. Some do."
-   From "The Movie They Said Could Never Be Made" in _The Joy of Clichés_ by Nigel Rees:
    
    **Dr. Big:** You're just like all the others. You think I'm mad, don't you?  
    **Side-Kick:** Not mad, but how about _geisteskrank_?  
    **Dr. Big:** _Geisteskrank_ is such an _ugly_ word!
    
-   In one of Ernest Bramah's _Kai Lung_ stories, what most fantasy stories would call the thieves' Guild refers to itself as the "Joined-Together Band of Excrescence-Removers and Superfluity Adjustors".
-   In the first _Kingdom Keepers_ book, Wayne says that Finn would only "borrow" Walt Disney's pen, as opposed to stealing it. Possibly inspired by the exchange in _Robin Hood (1973)_, above.
-   For most of the book _The One and Only Ivan_, Ivan insists that the small glass-windowed space he is confined to isn't a "cage", it's a "domain", the same word he uses for the territories of wild gorillas. Ruby's arrival, and the death of the elephant who always called it a cage, shakes his complacency and his general attempt to Cope by Pretending that things are fine, so he ends up reconsidering.
-   In _The Scarlet Pimpernel_, Marguerite calls Chauvelin out for forcing her to spy on her peers (to uncover the Scarlet Pimpernel's identity) to ensure her brother's safety.
    
    "Fie! two very ugly words, fair lady," protested Chauvelin, urbanely. "There can be no question of force, and the service which I would ask of you, in the name of France, could never be called by the shocking name of spying."
    
-   Sherlock Holmes's client brings up the ugly word after Holmes politely attempts to avoid it in "The Problem of Thor Bridge":
    
    **Holmes:** This case is quite sufficiently complicated to start with without the further difficulty of false information.  
    **Client:** Meaning that I lie.  
    **Holmes:** Well, I was trying to express it as delicately as I could, but if you insist upon the word I will not contradict you.
    
-   In _Spock's World_, McCoy insists on his hacking being called "borrowing" rather than "stealing."

    Live-Action TV

-   _The Basil Brush Show_:

    **Steven:** Well, rearrange this then. Grounded. You. Forever. Are!
    
-   Used on _The Big Bang Theory_, about a robot belonging to NASA that Howard brought with him to Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.
    
    **Penny:** Does NASA know you're using that thing as a napkin holder?  
    **Howard:** Are you kidding? They still think it's in a secure locker at JPL.  
    **Penny:** You _stole_ it?  
    **Howard:** _Borrowed!_ The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.
    
-   Two nonsensical examples in _A Bit of Fry and Laurie_:
    
    **Stephen Fry:** I dislike the word brothel, Mr. Jowett. I prefer to use the word brothels. Yes, this is a brothels.  
    (Note that it was a shoe shop.)  
    and  
    **Hugh:** You certainly came prepared, didn't you?  
    **Stephen:** I prefer to put it this way: I certainly came prepared, didn't I?
    
-   In the _Blackadder Goes Forth_ episode "General Hospital", during a discussion of spying, Melchett becomes so concerned with what's "a dirty word" and what isn't that he loses touch with the actual subject entirely.
    
    **Melchett:** "Security" isn't a dirty word, Blackadder. "Crevice" is a dirty word, but not "security".  
    _\[later\]_  
    **Blackadder:** Well, good thing your job<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is also your hobby.  
    **Melchett:** Now there's another dirty word: "job".  
    _\[even later\]_  
    **Darling:** We've found a leak.  
    **Melchett:** Now "leak" is a positively _disgusting_ word.
    
-   In the finale of _Boston Legal_:
    
    **Carl Sack:** Fired is such an ugly word, Alan. An accurate one, but...
    
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   In the third season finale, when Buffy informed Wesley that she was through taking orders from the Watchers Council...
        
        **Wesley:** This is mutiny!  
        **Buffy:** I call it "graduation".
        
    -   Also:
        
        **Buffy:** So...am I crazy?  
        **Willow:** Well, "crazy" is such a strong word...  
        **Giles:** Let's not rule it out, though.
        
-   _Burn Notice_: But at least Brennen admits it.
    
    **Michael:** You're forcing me to break into a weapons manufacturer?  
    **Brennen:** "Forcing" is such an ugly word. Encouraging. Incentivizing... No, you're right, let's go with forcing.
    
-   _Castle_ has a suspect in one episode who isn't fond of the word "stalking". But he did follow the victim around for a few days...
-   _El Chavo del ocho_: When Quico chides el Chavo for pretending to sleepwalk at his house to steal a bag of bread, Chavo's response is "But I didn't steal the bread. I just _ate_ it."
-   _The Comic Strip Presents_ episode "Space Virgins from the Planet Sex" has alien women needing human men to get them pregnant. They shy away from the term "sex slave" in favour of a description of being forced to have sex.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   In "The Big Bang", the Doctor, saying goodbye to a young Amy, mentions, "Did I tell you that I stole the TARDIS? Well, borrowed." His subsequent description of the TARDIS as "ancient and modern at the same time and the most brilliant blue ever" allowed Amy to remember it at her wedding to Rory as "Something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue."
    -   Brought up again in "The Doctor's Wife":
        
        **Idris (the TARDIS in a human form)**: Then you stole me. And I stole you.  
        **The Doctor:** I borrowed you.  
        **Idris:** Borrowing implies the eventual intention to return the thing that it was taken. What makes you think I would ever give you back?
        
-   In _Downton Abbey_, when the Countess Dowager asks Doctor Clarkson to make some "amenagements" with the truth to help Cora reconcile with Robert.
    
    **Dr Clarkson**: So you want me to lie to them and say there was no chance at all?  
    **Countess Dowager**: Lie is such an unmusical word.
    
-   _Family Matters_:
    
    -   In the episode "False Arrest", Carl is confronted by Buddy Goodrich, a celebrity whom he'd arrested earlier in the episode for assault. Goodrich tries to talk Carl out of putting him on trial because he could simply have his assistant lie to the jury to counter any bad press that would come from the incident. Carl, of course, is having none of it:
    
    **Carl:** So what you're gonna have him do is lie? Commit perjury?  
    **Goodrich:** Those are such ugly words, Carl! They're true, but still...they're very ugly.
    
    -   When that doesn't work, Goodrich tries to offer Carl money for a one-time appearance on his show, which Carl also rejects:
        
        **Carl:** So what you're offering me is a bribe?  
        **Goodrich:** Ooh, another ugly word!
        
-   In _Farscape_, when Rygel is accused of "snurching" (_Farscape_\-ese for "stealing"), he responds "I don't _snurch_, I... _procure_."
-   From the _Frasier_ episode "The Devil and Dr. Willly":
    
    **Babe:** I'm just talking about having a little fun. After all, when I'm having fun, I'm happy. When I'm happy, I work harder. When I work harder, you become famous and powerful. Isn't that what you want? Fame and power?  
    **Frasier:** I like to think of it more as "influence", really, but...
    
-   An episode of _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_:
    
    **Will:** You hustled me!  
    **Pool Shark:** Hustled is such an ugly word. I like to call it creative money management.
    
-   Subverted in _Haven_:
    
    **Duke**: Lying is such an ugly word...but yeah, I lied.
    
-   The MacGuffin in one _Hogan's Heroes_ episode is a collection of artwork taken from occupied France for a high-ranking German official's private collection — described as "not 'stolen'... 'confiscated'".
-   In _Jessica Jones (2015)_, Kilgrave, serial mind rapist, doesn't like the word 'rape', despite that being exactly what he did to Jessica, Hope Schlottman, and almost every woman he's encountered. He seems to acknowledge that's exactly what he did when Jessica confronts him on this, but denies it at first and later mutters that he doesn't like what he does being described that way.
-   Averted in the _Kraft Suspense Theatre_ episode "One Step Down". When sleazy No-Tell Motel owner Homer Fargis tries to get money out of wealthy Janet Cord for _almost_ cheating on her husband, she replies "That's blackmail!"—and he responds with a Blunt "Yes".
-   On an episode of _Life_, Charlie Crews abducts the Big Bad by waylaying his chauffeur and picking him up in his own car. When the victim points out that "this is a kidnapping," Charlie parks the car and begins to explain why he doesn't like that word and doesn't feel it applies in this case. The villain then says, "No, detective, you misunderstand me. This isn't a kidnapping. _This_ is a kidnapping." Cue a tire iron smashing through Charlie's window.
-   Don West in _Lost in Space (2018)_ hates to be called a smuggler. He's an _importer_ of rare goods.
-   Combined with Brief Accent Imitation in _Lovejoy_ when some former soviets ask if an official is "Coorv-ed"
    
    **Tinker:** I think he means "Bent"  
    **Lovejoy:** I prefer "Coorv-ed".
    
-   _M\*A\*S\*H_ has a few examples, generally involving Klinger.
    -   In the episode "Morale Victory", where Hawkeye and BJ get named morale officers, Klinger shakes them down for a 3-day pass to go on an errand for them.
        
        **BJ**: You thief!  
        **Klinger**: "Thief" is such an ugly word. Shall we say "entrepreneur"?
        
    -   A little later in the same episode, they find out Klinger was going where they wanted him to anyway:
        
        **Hawkeye**: You just stole a 3-day pass from us.  
        **Klinger**: "Stole" is such an ugly word. Shall we say "creatively acquired"?
        
    -   Subverted in "The Price":
        
        **Klinger:** Bribery is such an ugly word. Ugly, but fitting.
        
-   In "The Scarlet Letter" episode of _The Mentalist_, the line is fairly self-explanatory.
    
    **Minelli:** You abused a corpse to get a confession.  
    **Jane:** Used. Used a corpse. There's no "ab".
    
-   _One Hundred Deeds For Eddie Mc Dowd_:
    
    **Justin:** I hate you!  
    **Eddie**: Justin, hate is a very strong word.
    
-   _Person of Interest_: Finch, to Carter in "Baby Blue":
    
    **Carter:** You hacked into his company?  
    **Finch:** 'Hacked' is such an ugly word.
    
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   In the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield", Kirk accuses Lokai of stealing, making off with, whatever, the shuttle. Lokai replies, "I do not _make off_ with things! My need gave me the right to use the ship! Mark the word, sir: The _use_ of it!"
    -   In _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, Garak isn't pleased with Siskos' encouragement to help him with a rescue mission.
        
        **Garak:** Commander, this is extortion!  
        **Sisko:** Hm... yes, it is.
        
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_: In "Concerning Flight", the villain Tau is a Space Pirate turned Arms Dealer and has this as his Establishing Character Moment.
        
        **Alien Buyer:** Your prices are said to be unreasonable.  
        **Tau:** Unreasonable is such a strong term. But if I can't sell to you, I'll sell to one of the other colonies in your system. A violent sort, your neighbours, aren't they? I'd hate to make your life difficult by offering my weapons to them. But if you don't give me a choice...
        
-   _Succession_: While reading obituaries of their father, the siblings muse that wording like "man of his age" is a polite way to say "racist and lenient on sexual assault".
-   _Switch (1975)_: Pete isn't counterfeiting money, he's _simulating_ it.
-   _The Umbrella Academy (2019)_: Klaus thinks that 'cult' is a very negative term, and prefers his to be called an 'alternative spiritual community'. Allison refuses to play ball and reiterates that he started a cult.
-   _Who's the Boss?_, "Not With My Client You Don't": Angela's assistant calls "hooker" an ugly word and prefers "call girl".
-   _Yes, Minister_:
    
    -   This is an almost character-defining trope for Sir Humphrey Appleby, who usually merges it with spectacular Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness.
    
    **Bernard:** It is a bit of a cover-up, isn't it?  
    **Sir Humphrey:** Certainly not, Bernard. It is a responsible discretion exercised in the national interest to prevent unnecessary disclosure of eminently justifiable procedures in which untimely revelations would severely impair public confidence.  
    **Bernard:** I see. _\[beat\]_ It's like Watergate?
    
    -   In another episode, Sir Humphrey assures Hacker that, if a certain report is unfavorable, it will never see the light of day. He's then offended when Hacker refers to that as suppression.
        
        **Sir Humphrey** Suppression is the instrument of totalitarian dictatorships, we don't talk of that sort of thing in a free country! We simply take a democratic decision not to publish it.
        
    -   From the _Yes, Prime Minister_ episode "A Conflict of Interest":
        
        **Hacker:** You mean he's indiscreet?  
        **Humphrey:** That's such a pejorative word. I prefer to say he's obsessively honest.
        

    Music 

-   From "Erase" by They Might Be Giants:
    
    Think of this as solving problems  
    That should never have occurred  
    Please don't call it "strangulation"  
    That is such an ugly word
    

    Podcasts 

-   _Quest in Show_: When Suzy expresses discomfort at stealing Queen Manon’s things, Prose advises her not to think of it as stealing. When Suzy asks what should she think of it as, Prose replies, “Not stealing!” She then suggests “rehoming”.

    Roleplay 

-   Happens twice with Ivy in _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_. First she creates a robotic drone that then orders a Nintendo Switch for her without taking any money from her account; when her friend Luna points out that that's stealing, she rephrases it as 'getting it for free'. Then, when she needs to find a bucket of water to put out a fire, she 'borrows' one from a nearby garden, she doesn't steal it.

    Video Games 

-   When the AI declares war on you in _Civilization V_, one of the quote they may use is "Backstab is such an ugly word. Shall we instead say I am just "reinterpreting" our supposed friendship?".

-   In _Disgaea: Hour of Darkness_, after we find out the real reason of **CAPTAIN GORDON, DEFENDER OF EARTH!**'s mission to the Netherworld, this conversation takes place:
    
    **Kurtis**: Hmph. They're nothing but pawns to you, huh...  
    **General Carter**: What an ugly way of saying it, Kurtis. I prefer to call them the "heroes who sacrificed their lives for the earth". Muhahahahaha!!
    
-   _Fallout: New Vegas_ has Mr. House
    
    **Courier:** In the meantime, you'd rule Vegas as some kind of dictator?  
    **Mr. House:** I prefer the term 'autocrat'.
    
-   _Final Fantasy VI_ with Locke, and his insistence that he's not a thief, he's a "treasure hunter". Naturally, he often "hunts for treasure" in other people's homes. But press the issue and he might rip your lungs out. Or at least steal your clothes.
    
    "Bah! Semantic nonsense!"
    
-   In _Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates_
    
    **Aleria:** She's a sacrifice to your god?!  
    **Chaspel:** "Sacrifice" is such a harsh word. "Catalyst" sounds so much nicer.
    
-   _Galaxy Angel_: On Milfie's route in Moonlit Lovers, Tact calls Noah a "mercenary" when Milfie convinces her to help them by offering her some food. Noah replies that she would prefer to be called an "utilitarian".
-   In _Geneforge V_, a bandit argues over semantics.
    
    **Emogene:** I object to the word "extort". It is an ugly term. We are helping them. If they are so tight with their coins that they can't pay us for this service, it is a good thing we are here to teach them manners.
    
-   _God Hand_:
    
    **Gene:** This arm makes me popular among the hellish set.  
    **Conchita (a demon):** _Hellish?!?_ We prefer "supertropical".
    
-   This exchange is brought up in _Jak II: Renegade_ when the words "forced labour trade" are mentioned:

    **Krew:** Uh, I prefer "freedom challenged".
    
-   In the German version of _Kingdom Hearts II_, Demyx responds to Goofy accusing him of being a thief with "Dieb –- was für ein hässliches Wort!", meaning "Thief –- what an ugly word!".
-   In _Kathy Rain_, the titular character has this conservation when confronting Father Issac with the Red Scythe plant, which has psychedelic properties.
    
    **Kathy:** You know something about this plant, right?  
    **Father Issac:** Oh, yes, a link to the divine. They help by preparing the body for unity with God.  
    **Kathy:** So, you've drugged people with it?  
    **Father Issac:** Such a crude choice of words. It has been _one_ component of my sacred work, yes.
    
-   _Persona_:
    -   In _Persona 3_, when SEES confronts Ikutsuki and learns of the latter's intentions, this happens twice in the same conversation:
        
        **Yukari:** In the video from my father... He said to defeat the Shadows... Was that a lie too?  
        **Ikutsuki:** Ah... He did record that himself. ...Of course, I had to make some modifications.  
        **Mitsuru:** You doctored it!?  
        **Ikutsuki:** I _corrected_ it.
        
        **Yukari:** You used both me and my father!  
        **Ikutsuki:** "Used" is such an ugly word. It was for the sake of the world, so how could it be wrong?
        
    -   In _Persona 5_, one of the Confidant bonuses received from formerly-crooked politician Yoshida<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  lets the party demand more money from enemy Shadows they're holding at gunpoint. Said bonus is called "Fundraising".
-   _Pokémon Insurgence_:
    
    **Zenith:** Mind control is such an ugly term. I prefer "mind optimization".
    
-   In _Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal_, during an episode of Supervillain Weekly:
    
    **Supervillain Weekly Host**: Lawrence, tell us a bit about this top-secret "super weapon" being constructed on Planet Daxx?  
    **Lawrence**: Well, "super" is such a strong word... For that matter "weapon" may be a tad overdoing it.
    
-   From _Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_:
    
    **HK-50:** Clarification: "Assassin Droid" is such a crude term, master, reserved for durasteel drones with only the most archaic kill-programs. The function I perform has been referred to as "wanton slaughter". I prefer to see it as a means of facilitating communication, resulting in the termination of hostilities.
    
-   From _Star Wars: The Old Republic_:
    
    **NPC:** You're Insane!  
    **Sith Inquisitor:** Insane is such a harsh word. I prefer differently rational.
    
-   _Thief II: The Metal Age_, while looting a ruined city:
    
    **Garrett:** Archaeologist sounds so much more dignified than Thief.
    
-   Cheekily Subverted in _Xcom 2_, when accessing the black market to buy ADVENT materials:
    
    **Alien Alloy Tooltip**: "Stealing" is a harsh word for how we acquired these alloys. Accurate, but harsh.
    

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Spirit Hunter: NG_, Ban is fond of using nice euphemisms for his dirty work.
    -   Rosé gets annoyed with Ban for extorting the high-schooler Akira. Ban retorts that it wasn't 'extortion', he was just 'collecting fees' that he was due.
    -   When Rosé talks about breaking-and-entering into the Miroku residence, Ban rephrases it as them 'investigating' the place. Rosé makes fun of him for being so hung up on the terminology.

    Webcomics 

-   Mr. Butch from _Chopping Block_ is not a "serial killer". He prefers the term "High Yield Afterlife Inducement Broker."
-   Inverted in _Intragalactic_:
    
    **Captain Glee:** "Unofficial incentive" is such an ugly... pair of words. Let's just say I bribed you with full knowledge that I'm violating the law.
    
-   Much like Haley, Mordekai from _Irregular Webcomic!_ is a "Lovable Rogue".
-   Revolver Ocelot in _The Last Days of Foxhound_:
-   Gav in _Nukees_, in a way illuminating his character.
    
    **Gav:** "Better" is such an ugly word...
    
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   Haley Starshine dislikes being called a thief. She prefers "Freelance Wealth Redistribution Specialist".
    -   Also, when Vaarsuvius' mate questions where V got a massive power boost:
        
        **Vaarsuvius:** I negotiated an exchange with three gentlemen from... other planes of existence.  
        **Inkyrius:** _Which_ planes?  
        **Vaarsuvius:** Those in the ventral position.  
        **Inkyrius:** You _sold your soul to fiends??_  
        **Vaarsuvius:** Technically, it is more of a fixed-term lease with an occupancy date yet to be determined!
        
-   This ''Pibgorn'' strip:
    
    **Stan:** These creatures you treasure, they are as good as dead unless you follow my instructions to the letter.  
    **Pibgorn:** So they're hostages!  
    **Stan:** "Hostage" is such an ugly, sordid word ... yes. They're hostages.
    
-   _Schlock Mercenary_ has a few examples. On the rare occasion acknowledging their status as mercenaries is politically inconvenient, the Toughs and others will be called "security and armed response." There's also:
    
    **Petey:** "Spy" is such a short ugly word. I prefer "espionage". Those three extra syllables really say something.
    
-   In this _Sluggy Freelance_ strip, the Evil Chancellor doesn't like the term "bad guy", preferring to be called "morally challenged".
-   _Spacetrawler_: inverted, "Please, don't call it a gift. Call it a bribe."
-   _Unsounded_: The Aldish insist on calling the rebellion in Avelpit the Foi-Hellick "Affair". This lets them play down the brutality with which they put down the rebels and their families and makes the whole thing sound like it was Roger Foi-Hellick's idea rather than a populist uprising which he had a part in leading.

    Web Original 

-   _Critical Role_: In episode 84 of the first campaign, Kima _tries_ to invoke this, but poor Grog doesn't really get such subtleties.
    
    **Kima:** If Mr. Vord starts coming round asking questions? ...Tell him you haven't seen me.  
    **Grog:** Lie?  
    **Kima:** No, no... Just tell him you haven't seen me.  
    **Grog:** _(Confused)_ But I have seen you...  
    **Kima:** Tell him you haven't.  
    **Grog:** _\[Turns to Vex and Pike for help, the expression on his face causing the entire table to erupt into minutes-long peals of laughter.\]_
    
-   Similarly, this post on the (now disused) old NationStates forums, memorialised in someone's signature:
    
    _Extortion is such a nasty word.  
    I much prefer "magnolia". "Magnolia" is a much nicer word._
    
-   This<small>◊</small> demotivator. They're not pirates, they're _preemptive nautical salvage experts_.
-   Genocide is such a harsh word...
-   "Pre-release" used to be a euphemism for "stolen from the Chinese factory it was made in" when it came to Transformers action figures. Internet Personality Vangelus rejects this euphemism, preferring "Stolen Chinese Toys".
-   Parodied in one _Show of the Weekend_ for _Outside Xbox_, which has Luke defend his choice to harvest all the Little Sisters in _Bioshock_ by saying "harvested" is such a harsh word and he prefers "murdered". It takes him a moment to realise that it didn't go the way he planned.
-   _Texts From Last Night:_
    
    **(928):** whats a positive sounding word for "exploit"?
    
-   Calling the trope Jack Bauer Interrogation Technique is much more professional-sounding than 'Violent physical abuse until they give you the information'.
-   One Internet meme consists of an image macro of a sketchy-looking guy with a moustache reading "Kidnap? I prefer the term 'surprise adoption'."

    Western Animation 

-   _Archer_: When Archer is training Cyril to be a spy early in season one, he stresses that to us the term "call girl" and NOT "hooker". Unless they're dead (which happens with surprising regularity to Archer), then they're hookers.
-   In _Batman: The Animated Series_, when a captured Batman is put on "trial" by the inmates of Arkham Asylum and district attorney Janet Van Dorn helps him as best she can by sowing discord among the criminals:
    
    **Harley:** Ha! You're just jealous because you don't have a fella who's as lovin' and loyal to you as my Puddin' is to me!  
    **Van Dorn:** Ah-ha. And I suppose it was that same "loyalty" I saw the last time you escaped and "Puddin'" here finked on you in hopes of getting time off!  
    **Harley:** _(dejected)_ Is that true, Puddin'?  
    **Joker:** _(sheepishly)_ "Finked" is such an ugly word....  
    **Harley:** _(grabs Joker and starts shaking him)_ You lousy, scum-sucking creep!
    
-   _Biker Mice from Mars_: As Ronaldo Rump says, kidnapping is such a harsh word. He prefers to describe Charley as a "reluctant guest".
-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_, "Op LEADER": Chad calls "traitor" an ugly word. Which he isn't.
-   _Dan Vs._:
    
    -   Played Straight in "Technology," where big tech CEO Barry Ditmer prefers "guiding synaptic processes from afar" to "mind control."
    -   Subverted in "Anger Management":
    
    **Amber:** "Extortion" is such an ugly word. I prefer..."extortion".  
    **Dan:** That's the same word.  
    **Amber:** I said it nicer the second time.
    
-   In _Danny Phantom_ when Danny calls Vlad a Green Bay Packers fanatic. Vlad openly admits it.
    
    **Vlad:** Fanatic is such a negative word... but yes.
    
-   In _Elena of Avalor Song of the Sirenas_, when Elena accuses her cousin Cristobal of betraying their family, he replies, "Betrayed is such a nasty word." But when he thinks about it, he can't think of a better word and he concedes "no, you're right, betrayed works."
-   On _Invasion America_, this exchange takes place:
    
    **Cale Oosha:** TREASON!  
    **Dragit:** Revolution.
    
-   _Metalocalypse_: The band members don't like talking about dying (when it's them); they prefer the term "hamburger time".
-   Inverted in _Phineas and Ferb_. When it's suggested that Mitch is essentially a zookeeper, he feels that "sort of legitimizes the whole thing," and prefers to be called a poacher.
-   Played with in _Rick and Morty_
-   _The Simpsons_:
    
    -   Homer posing as 4th-grader:
    
    **Homer:** _(to Sherri)_ C'mon, why won't you go out with Bart?  
    **Sherri:** He's a smelly, ugly dork!  
    **Homer:** Ugly is such a smelly word.
    
    -   Another _Simpsons_ example:
    
    **Lisa:** You're replacing me?  
    **Homer:** Now, Lisa, "dumping" is such a harsh word. Let's just say I'm _replacing_ you.
    
    -   And another:
    
    **Marge:** Did you jimmy open Mr. Burns' liquor cabinet?  
    **Homer:** Jimmy is such an ugly word. Unless you're talking about Jimmy Smits. Mrrow!
    
    -   In the Treehouse of Horror Bartificial Intelligence
    
    **Bart:** Did you replace me with this tinker toy?!  
    **Homer:** Replace is such an ugly word. We upgraded.
    
-   _Spider-Man: The Animated Series_:
    
    **Michael Morbius**: I borrowed this equipment from the ESU Science Department.  
    **Felicia Hardy**: Pilfered.  
    **Michael Morbius**: ...Borrowed.
    
-   _Spongebob Squarepants_:
    
    -   The series includes a variation in "Bucket Sweet Bucket".
    
    **Mr. Krabs:** _(takes the safe out from his throat)_ And I bet you tried to steal this, too.  
    **Plankton:** _(chuckles)_ Well, steal is such a strong word.
    
    -   Also parodied when, in order to try pleasing an important food critic after Squidward's demeanor nearly makes him leave, Mr. Krabs offers a Krabby Patty. But the penny-pinching crustacean is unable to get past the F in "free" (spraying spit all over the critic during the attempt) and switches to "complimentary."
-   _Star Wars Rebels_. Lando Calrissian thinks that "smuggler" is such a small word. "I'm more of a galactic entrepreneur."
-   In _The Venture Brothers_, the Guild of Calamitous Intent also don't like morally charged phrases like "good guys" or "bad guys", and insist people use "protagonist" and "antagonist" instead. In all fairness, with guys like Brock Sampson running around, it is a legitimate complaint.
