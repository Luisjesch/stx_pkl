A common trope, this is the use of a freeze-frame at the end of a work.

The moving image, most typically if not always a close up of a character's face, turns into a still. It may or may not get a zoom. The character is usually in a dramatic pose, or with a specific expression. Freeze. Roll credits.

The character is usually the protagonist, and the pose can be of a variety, but often a smile, laugh or a Double Take.

Though now a technique used more meaningfully — often to connect with the character — or as parody, in some Eighties whodunits it was treated as a standard of its television show format.

In the field of Film Studies, scholars promote François Truffaut's _The 400 Blows_ as the earliest notable use (or Ur-Example). At the end there is a freeze and then zoom on the young protagonist's face as he looks, conflicted, at the camera. The scene was also used as both the original promotional and cover image for the film, possibly the first time such a scene has made it into mass marketing.

One variation is a 'flash' sequence, when there is a freeze frame featuring the initial credits before possibly a Stinger and then the actual credits.

This trope can be specific kind of Fourth Wall-breaking, in instances when a character looks directly into the camera, but still is not completely breaking the fourth wall as it is often treated as an addendum to the actual work. It may also be a Pastel-Chalked Freeze Frame. Compare Group Picture Ending and "YEAH!" Shot.

-   _Backstreet Dreams_ combines this with Off-into-the-Distance Ending, with Dean, Stevie, and Shane driving to California, where there's a special school Dean hopes will help Shane.
-   _God Told Me To_ ends with a shot of Pete's face, along with a caption saying he was committed to the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.
-   _The Abduction of Saint Anne_ ends with Anne waving.
-   _Electra Glide in Blue_ has a very lengthy final shot set to "Tell Me." Wintergreen is killed in a Sudden Downer Ending, and over the course of several minutes, the camera backs away from his corpse on the highway until he recedes into the distance. Then the image freezes and stays that way for about a minute before the colors fade to black and white. Then the credits roll over the image.
-   _Jimmie (2008)_ ends with a freeze-frame on Jimmie's face after the Dolphins win first prize at the swimming competition.
-   Parodied and lampshaded in _Odd Squad: The Movie_, where the main 7 suit up in Odd Squad suits, and pose for the camera. After standing in the same spot for a while, Oscar asks how long they have to hold the pose.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Sitcoms do this extensively, especially during The '80s, usually punctuating a last gag. Kenneth parodied this in an episode of _30 Rock_, when he did his own personal freeze frame ending, while everyone else puzzled at him suddenly standing in a frozen Milking the Giant Cow pose.
-   _Another World_ would end all its episodes like this in the eighties.
-   _A Bit of Fry and Laurie_: Parodied in the pilot episode. The final sketch is a send-up of terrible Australian soap operas, and ends with a dumb joke and a freeze frame...except that the camera is still rolling. The credits roll in their entirety while Hugh does a ridiculous expression and Stephen balances on one foot.
-   _CHiPs_: The Stingers use multiple freeze-frames during the scene.
-   _Corner Gas_: Every episode ends this way, and it is actually lampshaded in "Lacey Borrows".

-   _Degrassi_:
    -   _Degrassi Junior High_ and _Degrassi High_ ended every episode with a static shot of the focus character as the credits rolled. The only exception was the final episode of _Junior High_, "Bye-Bye, Junior High", where the credits play over the school burning down.
    -   _Degrassi: The Next Generation_ followed suit but it did not play over the credits. It was retired after the ninth season.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Part two of "Genesis of the Daleks" uses this for a cliffhanger, ending on a shot of Sarah falling from the scaffolding around the Thals' missile.
    -   Part three of "The Deadly Assassin" infamously ends on a freeze-frame shot of Goth attempting to drown the Doctor. The cliffhanger drew so much outcry from Moral Guardians that it actually got producer Philip Hinchcliffe kicked off the show; the offending footage was wiped from the master tape, and the cliffhanger was altered around this. However, off-air U-matic recordings of the uncensored version survived, and the original cliffhanger was restored from these for home media releases.
    -   "Revelation of the Daleks" closes with the Doctor and Peri deciding to go somewhere more lighthearted after their trip to Tranquil Repose turned out to be anything but. The Doctor comes up with an idea and tells Peri that "I'll take you to—" before getting cut off by a freeze-frame into the credits. This was meant to lead into the next season's opener, "The Nightmare Fair", where he would've finished the sentence with "Blackpool," but a BBC-imposed 18-month hiatus led to the entire season being rewritten. The footage of the complete line was consequently thrown out.
-   _Farscape_. The episode "Nerve" freezes on John Crichton screaming in agony as he's Mind Raped in the Aurora Chair.
-   _Hogan's Heroes_: First utilized a flash-freeze frame beginning in Season Five, when previous producer Edward H. Feldman had been promoted to executive producer (a position the series didn't previously have); this carried on for the remainder of the show's run.
-   _The Krofft Supershow_. Each of the show's recurring segments ended this way to highlight the specific writers, directors, and other crewmembers for those particular segments.

-   _M\*A\*S\*H_ began using the flash variation in Season Six, usually to acknowledge the show's ever-changing story editors (or script consultants as they were eventually called), program consultants, and to acknowledge creative consultants Gene Reynolds (co-creator and previous producer) and Alan Alda. Also depending on the nature of the episode, the variation of the music cue would differ: standard episodes included a short variation of the show's main theme, sombre and poignant episodes would exclude music altogether, and particularly dramatic and Downer Episodes would use a slower and more melancholy arrangement. This continued up until the Grand Finale.
-   About four-fifths of _Miami Vice_ episodes end this way, with some even ending in a death. Notable examples were "No Exit" where the apparent Karma Houdini criminal of the episode ends up being shot by his abused wife and in "Florence Italy" where the killer, a race car driver who has been eluding capture all episode long, ends up crashing his car into a wall at high speed after being surrounded by police.

-   _NCIS_: This happens not just at the end of each episode, but the end of every segment, as well. The freeze frame is always black and white.
-   _Odd Squad_:
    -   The end of the episode “Disorder in the Court” has a variety of characters jumping into the air with a simultaneous “Yeah!” Lampshaded during Oscar’s Where Are They Now voiceover, when he ends it with “...and Danny T. remains frozen in middair until this day.”
    -   The season 2 and 3 finales also end on freeze-frames, both with the main agents using gadgets against oddness.
-   _Orange Is the New Black_: The season 4 finale, focusing on Poussey's backstory in light of her death, ends with the image of her by the river in New York City, smiling into the camera. The actress noted how that's not a thing that OITNB does, but after seeing it knew that the producers and directors were right to do it. Aside from ending the story well, the set-up of the shot evokes _The 400 Blows_, and so may be additionally referring to and invoking a lot of the unfair judicial practices and discrimination.
-   _Police Squad!_ parodies this Once an Episode. Everyone on screen stops moving beneath the credits, but the camera continues to roll, so everyone is still blinking, breathing and trying hard to maintain their pose as their expression twists into a grimace with the strain. Props fall over and coffee continues to pour until it overflows a character's cup. In one episode, the caught perpetrator doesn't freeze with everyone else and starts running around the room trying to escape. In another, a policeman enters the room after everyone freezes, so adopts various 'freeze' poses to try and fit in.
-   The 1992-3 Australian Police Procedural _Phoenix_, most notably in the episode "Give A Dog A Bone" which freezes on a detective being groin-punched by one of his colleagues.
-   _The Professionals_
    -   "When the Heat Cools Off" ends with an imprisoned cop killer being told his plan to get his conviction reversed has failed, and he'll now spend the rest of his life in prison for another murder he had committed. The scene freezes on him angrily pounding a fist on the table.
    -   "Fugitive" presents a sympathetic view of a female terrorist that CI5 captures. She gets shot in the back by another terrorist as she's fleeing towards an escape aircraft, and the episode freezes on Cowley cradling her dead body.
-   The _Red Dwarf_ episode "Balance of Power" ends on a freeze frame of Lister leaping into the air in victory. This was done as a pragmatic measure: while filming the scene, Craig Charles landed badly and injured his back, rendering the end of the shot unusable and preventing reshoots.
-   _Seinfeld_ had the short freeze frame from the beginning for Larry David (Seasons One through Seven) and Jerry Seinfeld (Seasons Eight and Nine) as executive producer, and co-executive producers George Shapiro & Howard West.
-   Every _Space: 1999_ episode ends this way.
-   Almost every _Starsky & Hutch_ episode ends this way.
-   Every _Switch (1975)_ episode ends with one.
-   _Threesome_ did this routinely, sometimes with the main cast's credits over it, before The Stinger.
-   Used at the end of the final episode of ITV mini-series _Tina And Bobby_, after a silent montage of Tina and Bobby having fun and laughing together after coincidentally meeting on a train. As Tina is laughing, she turns and it freezes when she is looking into the camera, then fades to the "doom slate".
-   Happens on plenty of the ever-quirky "TV show you and I used to be on together" skits from _The Tonight Show_.
-   The Grand Finale of the 2017 series of _The Worst Witch_ ends on a freeze-frame of Mildred and her friends celebrating Mildred's promotion to Head Girl at assembly.

-   Tears for Fears:

    Theatre 

-   _The Inspector General_ by Nikolai Gogol ends with the officials hearing that the _real_ inspector wants to see them. According to the author's instructions, everyone is supposed to freeze in place (in thoroughly described positions) until the curtain falls over a minute later. Few performances have managed to follow these demands to a letter; Vsevolod Meyerhold actually used dolls for the scene.

    Web Animation 

-   A few episodes of _Let's Go! Tamagotchi_ end on a freeze-frame of a character. For example, one episode ends on a freeze-frame of Memetchi and Flowertchi.

    Western Animation 

-   The _Big City Greens_ episode "Fill Bill" ends with a freeze-frame of the Greens jumping happily.
-   The last episode of _The Boondocks_, "The New Black", ends with a photo of Riley Freeman running away from an angry mob of mentally-challenged children.
-   _Code Lyoko_ does this twice. In "Log Book," it freezes on Odd jumping in the air in a victory pose while Jeremie claps for the return of Ulrich's diary. In the episode "I'd Rather Not Talk About It", it ends with a still of Jim complimenting Jeremie on his courage.
-   _Family Guy_: Parodied in an episode where Peter leaps into the air in a happy victory and the scene seems to freeze, but then Lois asks how he's remaining in mid air, to which Peter panicky states he has no idea what's happening and can't get down.
-   _Fancy Nancy_: After Nancy learned that at her School De Fancy, everyone has their own way of being unique, she and her friends celebrate and the episode freezes on them doing a "YEAH!" Shot as the screen fades to black.
-   The first episode of _LoliRock_ ends in a freeze-frame of Iris, Talia and Auriana high-fiving.
-   The _Nature Cat_ episode "Skip It" plays this very similarly to the _Fancy Nancy_ example above, with Nature Cat shouting "Let's rock!" as the gang jumps in the air and the camera freezes on them as the screen fades out.
-   _The Simpsons_ episode "Any Given Sundance" parodied the ending of _The 400 Blows_ (compare).
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_ episode "Band Geeks" uses a freeze-frame ending where Squidward jumps in the air.
-   The Season 2 finale of _Wander over Yonder_ ends with a freeze-frame of Wander and Sylvia flying toward the camera in their orbble with Hater's ship chasing them.
