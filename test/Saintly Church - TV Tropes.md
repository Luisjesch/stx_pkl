The Church that is Always Lawful Good or Neutral Good. It is honestly interested in the saving of souls, promoting spiritual growth, and are generally shown to be simple, pure, and Good, like the Big Guy upstairs.

These are the Churches where you can find religious people good with children, animals, and the elderly. Kindly priests and other religious types ready to give help or good advice to any troubled heroes are to be had here, and in the more fantastical types of setting, clerics give healing of both the physical and spiritual to the wounded adventurer and resurrect the occasional dead teammate. Should the heroes ever meet The Pope or local equivalent of this church, more often than not, they will find themselves standing before a Reasonable Authority Figure very ready to hear what they say.

Crystal Dragon Jesus optional. Church Militant also optional because being good doesn't mean you can't kick ass.

In Speculative Fiction settings, the more likely you have an Always Chaotic Evil monster race that is hurt by holy powers, the more likely it is that the church will be good instead of evil. Sometimes this kind of Church may be portrayed alongside one of the corrupt or evil ones for contrast and to help emphasize the pure goodness of the religion.

Most Real Life churches would see themselves this way, and a good many of them are right, but even so, **No Real Life Examples, Please!** - This means that they are also too common anyway.

This will be replete with Good Shepherds, but they can also be found in the Corrupt Church, just as Sinister Ministers might be found here.

Sub-Trope of The Church. Contrast Path of Inspiration. The Evil Counterpart of this trope is the Corrupt Church. The polar opposite is Religion of Evil. Compare Church of Saint Genericus.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The Belkan Church of the Saint King in the _Lyrical Nanoha_ devotes its resources to building schools and hospitals and provides assistance to the Time-Space Administration Bureau whenever they can. In the third season, the Bureau itself (for whom all of the heroes work) has been revealed to have a darker side, so the Saint Church remains as the only incorruptible authority in the setting.
-   _Trinity Blood_ has Abel Nightroad as a friendly and goofy fellow. The head of the church is also a Nice Guy. Other members of the church are less heroic.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ has a church-related arc, wherein the clergy are supposed to be of the "kindly old man" variety, even though we never do meet them. The local nuns are, in fact, mages in nun habits.

    Comic Books 

-   in the _Hellboy_ comics, the church, and holy men in general are generally portrayed positively. Most priests are pretty nice guys and their blessings are genuinely effective against minor demons, though big ones like Helldad can shrug them off. Even vicious ones like the Inquisitors from _The Island_ and the Witchfinder General were usually the lesser of two evils. The Mignolaverse's cosmology is based on early Celtic mythology, corresponding to the time when the churches of the white Christ were around, but not necessarily dominant.
-   For the most part, the Catholic Church in _Warrior Nun Areala_ is portrayed very positively, as being an organization working directly under the authority of Heaven, empowered to hunt down and battle the forces of Hell, and optionally more mundane villainy such as Nazi masterminds. The order of Warrior Nuns is armed with weapons that, while lethal to demons and the undead, do not harm humans.
-   In Marvel's What If?... story where Wolverine became the Horseman of War future is a wannabe utopia where humanity has united under the threat of War (as in Wolverine, not war). There are retreats, held by monks, for people who wish to practice peace more than other people. The monks are the ultimate keepers of peace, teaching the way on non-violence in a world without war. One of the monks is Brother Xavier, who really is Wolverine, who has learned how to keep his anger in control.

    Film — Animated 

-   _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ split the character of Frollo into two characters, the Sinister Minister everyone knows, and the friendly and kind Archdeacon, who is essentially the novel version of Frollo before he becomes corrupted.
    -   Furthermore, alternative interpretations of scripture and religion are a theme present throughout the entire movie, shown best in Quasimodo and Frollo's songs "Heaven's Light" and "Hellfire", respectively.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _The Blind Side_: Christian charity is part of what motivates the Tuohys to help Michael.
-   _The Bravados:_ The local church is presented as a benign institution. The (non-villainous) characters view it so seriously that even Deputy Primo, the jail guard, takes a break from his duties to attend mass (with Sheriff Sanchez filling in for him). At the end of the movie, the priest is both firm and sympathetic while talking to Douglass about the moral implication of his Roaring Rampage of Revenge.
-   _Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter_: Naturally, when Christ Himself is out smiting evil He's going to have some disciples doing likewise.
-   In _The Minion_ Dolph Lundgren is a warrior priest who is a member of The Knights Templar. They hunt demons with blessed holy gauntlets fitted with spikes.

-   In _Of Gods And Men_, the French monks caught up in the Algerian civil war are like this. They've provided medical care and social services to their Muslim neighbors for decades, and are shown studying the Qu'ran. When Islamist insurgents try to kidnap the doctor at gunpoint, the abbot insists that if they bring their injured comrades to the monastery, the doctor will provide care no questions asked. The monks are as good as their word. When an opportunity to flee the violence arises, they all refuse because the villagers need them and, after all, Jesus wouldn't run from violence. They all get kidnapped and executed.
-   Where _The Purge: Election Year_ included a church where a politically-minded minister appealed to the wealthy pro-Purge elites by fusing worship with politics and Purging, _The First Purge_ has one that gives shelter, support, and community to the poor residents who do not wish to participate in the experiment... until white supremacists blow them up. It's also mentioned that the Pope has condemned the Purge.
-   _Star Wars_: The Jedi are like monks with laser swords. They catch criminals and mediate conflicts. Whether they are this trope though, depends on who you ask. Their portrayal in the Prequel Trilogy can be read as the Corrupt Church, although fans debate this. Also, it isn't technically a religion: although it tends to act like one.
-   The Catholic Church is depicted positively in _The White Sister_, with no corrupt or unsympathetic characters working for it. In particular, the "marriage to the Church" scene, in which the heroine officially becomes a nun, is portrayed with solemn reverence for the rituals taking place.

    Literature 

-   Almost all of the religious organizations in _The Dresden Files_ are good-aligned. This series runs on All Myths Are True and Fantasy Kitchen Sink, so there has to be a benevolent god who acts through saints, priests, and knights. This isn't necessarily the same thing as the entire institution being benevolent, it's just that Harry specializes in dealing with the magical bits of the world, and the magical bits of Catholicism are based in the mythology of absolute goodness. The priests in the church that don't have the power of faith and so on just don't show up in Harry's bailiwick. Most specifically St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago where Father Forthill resides, but there's also the Buddhist monastery that Mouse the Lion Dog puppy came from.
-   The churches run free hospitals in _Jennifer Government_, where everything down to the ambulance service is privatized. Volunteers for the hospitals take the hospital's name as an auxiliary surname.
-   The Christian Church in _Quo Vadis_ is unambiguously good. Its members live simple, happy lives, standing above the depraved environment surrounding them in Ancient Rome.
-   In the backstory to H. P. Lovecraft's _The Haunter of the Dark_, the evil Nyarlathotep-worshiping cult are routed by a Catholic/Baptist alliance between Father O'Malley and the Reverend Drowne. At the climax of the story, a group of Italian Catholics attempt to contain the avatar of Nyarlathotep within its prison using candles, but, sadly, it slips through.
-   David Weber's _Safehold_ books has the Church of Charis, created in book two in response to the corrupt Church of God Awaiting, headed by Archbishop Maikel Staynair.
    -   From the _Honor Harrington_ series, most religions are implied to be this, including Second Reformation Catholic (Queen Elizabeth III), Third Stellar (Honor herself), and the Church of Humanity Unchained (Grayson edition), which, although highly conservative and somewhat sexist, is largely good - personified in leader Reverend Hanks. Obviously, the Masadan variant - well, not so much.
-   The Universal Brotherhood in E.C. Tubb's _Dumarest of Terra_ books. The "monks" are pacifistic, doing good among the downtrodden, oppose the machinations of the Cyclan, and frequently assist Dumarest against them.
-   _Discworld_
    -   While originally nasty, the Omnian religion becomes one of these once Brutha becomes Cenobiarch at the end of _Small Gods_, because he strains out the nastiness.
    -   Implicitly (re)combined with Church Militant in _Unseen Academicals_, in which Mightily Oats is mentioned to have brought "Forgiveness" to the wild places of Uberwald, both in the literal sense and in the sense of a large axe.
-   The Catholic Church in _A Canticle for Leibowitz_ is portrayed as being the sole retainer of knowledge from the times before the Fire Deluge.
-   In the Lord Darcy series, the Church polices both itself and the Empire's sorcerers, using magically-Talented Sensitives to check that its members remain free of corruption.
-   _Song at Dawn_ is said to be led by a "genuine innocent" (Innocent III) and the church in Narbonne is only antagonistic to the heroes because its archbishop has a personal grudge against one of them. The rank and file members are genuinely zealous about reclaiming the Holy Land, preaching self-discipline, and steer clear of Knight Templar territory.
-   In Poul Anderson's "The Live Coward", the abbot is a shrewd politician. Nevertheless, Wing Alak knows better than to offer a direct bribe. When the abbot does ask for return, it's for technical expertise to advance farming on his planet — and for himself, some books on astronomy translated into their language, asked for with such touching curiosity about the stars that Alak resolves to keep it, though his job calls for him to break such promises without mercy.
-   _Kindling Ashes_: The Temple of Lua and Soan is a complicated example. They provide Giselle a bath and a warm meal just for showing up and looking like she needed it, but also because she wants to become an initiate. She's there on a gold smuggling assignment because no one would think to look for a hidden cache there, but Giselle thinks that this means that part of the clergy is part of the operation. She generally has a poor opinion of them because they think she's possessed, and she is, but by a dragon instead of an evil spirit but the clergy of this region isn't likely to see a difference because of the recent dragon war.
-   _Journey to Chaos_:
    -   The Priesthood of Zaticana spend their time volunteering as translators, starting summer reading programs, and running public libraries.
    -   The Brotherhood of Death work as hospices and also police in the case of necrocraft crimes.
-   In the _Village Tales_ novels, Dr. Jettou's _masjid,_ Monsignor Folan's Roman Catholic parish (and the diocese of Clifton), the Nonconformist chapels, and for that matter, despite all the ecclesiastical quarrels and church politics, the whole Church of England – especially the Alternative Oversight parishes of the setting, under Canon Paddick –, are very explicitly this. (Ask the poor and suffering, and they'll tell you so. So will wives and children of those domestic abusers who've been … persuaded to repent … by some militant churchmen.) So, for that matter, are all the faiths represented in the novels to date saintly: Judaism and the Salmons' charities, Sikhism with its _seva,_ Nepali Hinduism as represented by the local colony of retired _Gurkhas_...

    Live-Action TV 

-   The nuns of Nonnatus House on _Call the Midwife_ exemplify this trope, always caring for their poverty-stricken patients while refusing to pass judgment on them, to the point where the show may very well contain the most positive portrayal of Christianity of the past decade.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "New Earth": The Sisters of Plenitude run a hospital founded by charity to heal the sick. They take _oaths_ to do nothing but heal the sick. One of them says that the "people farm" thing was a last resort because nothing else they tried worked fast enough to heal all the sick people coming to them. When Cassandra releases the clone-humans, they quarantine the hospital to prevent anyone else from getting sick. They are still in the hospital when this happens. On the other hand, however, most of them express severe callousness towards the clones, not seeing them as real people and thinking nothing of incinerating clones who develop a consciousness.
    -   "The Impossible Planet"/"The Satan Pit": The Beast, who claims to be Satan, was imprisoned by a group called the Disciples of the Light, who are implied by the religious themes in the story to be a religious group who opposed the Beast because he was doing evil.
    -   "The Time of Angels"/"Flesh and Stone" introduces a militarized church from the 51st century. It provides heroic soldiers that help the Doctor neutralize the Weeping Angels. Octavian gives the sense that this is a routine mission. They're even helping criminals atone for their crimes (albeit in the sense of a parole officer).
-   The Way of the Prophets in _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_. Granted, for most of the series its leader is Sinister Minister Kai Winn, but it's made clear that she doesn't have that much influence on what the church itself believes, and her subordinates continue to be Good Shepherds.
-   _Galavant_ introduces The Order of Our Father of Perpetual Refrain. They are very hospitable, providing meals, drink, and baths to travelers. Even the "bad boy" among them is not _too_ bad because he's a monk.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Church of Pelor... and every church of good-aligned deities in _Dungeons & Dragons_ that are on the ball.
    -   Other major examples in the Third Edition standard cosmology are Hieronious (valor, heroism, etc.), Kord (strength), Moradin (patron of dwarves), Corellon Larethiean (patron of elves), Garl Glittergold (patron of gnomes), Yondala (patron of halflings), and Bahumat (lord of all good dragons).
    -   In the _Forgotten Realms_ setting, Ilmater tends to be this especially, but then, he is Crystal Dragon Jesus more than most. Also the divinely-granted spells of the worshipers of Sune, Goddess of Beauty and Love, are the closest thing to weaponized love in the setting.
        -   Tamara is also a good example, being the Neutral Good Draconic Goddess of life, light, mercy, and healing. Tamara's also noted to be the kindest and most benevolent of the draconic pantheon.
    -   A good Eberron example is the ancestor-worship of the Elves of Aerenal, which is Neutral Good and splits its time equally between giving advice to the still-living Elves and beating seven shades of undead crap out of the Blood of Vol.
    -   The Ministry of Elemental Good.
    -   The _Dragonlance_ setting has the Church of Paladine, which had become a Corrupt Church by the times of the Cataclysm, but, reborn under the guidance of Elistan, now fits the bill.
    -   In short, almost any church to a Good deity will either have extensive charitable operations or a generally benevolent police force, if not both.
-   _Warhammer_:
    -   The Church of Sigmar in the Fantasy version. They're the good guys, but it's more an example of Lawful Good Church Militant, except for the Witch Hunters, of course. Even the good ones are pretty vicious.
        -   The Temple of Shallya, goddess of healing and mercy, and also non-violence, what is quite hard a commitment in such a violent world as Warhammer.
    -   Elven deities range from pretty good to Axe-Crazy, but Asuryan especially usually comes across as a good guy. Making the Awesome Moment of Crowning into a Secret Test of Character helps.
-   The Brotherhood from _Mutant Chronicles_. Soulsaving Crusaders to a man, and willing to torture suspected heretics and assassinate dissidents. They also run charitable hospitals, schools, and soup kitchens, maintain the only universally recognized bank and currency, and mediate in corporate disputes.
-   In _Magic: The Gathering_, The Church of Avacyn on the plane of Innistrad is the only shining beacon of hope for humanity in a plane full of many horrors, most of them undead in one way or another. The church employs various Catholic-esque imagery, such as the Mark of Avacyn, a vaguely cross-like symbol used in many of the same contexts, and naming its prominent members as "Saints" (during life rather than posthumously). Unfortunately, its patron angel Avacyn is AWOL— until _Avacyn Restored_, where she breaks out of the Helvault to restore the Balance Between Good and Evil.
-   In _Pendragon_, individual Gamemasters are given the option of portraying the Roman Christian Church and the British Christian Church as providing a civilising and compassionate influence during a dark and brutal era... or, alternatively, portraying either or both as decadent and corrupt.

    Theatre 

-   _Marie Antoinette (Musical)_: Agnés, as the main representative of the Catholic Church in the German and 2006 Toho productions, tends to act as the moral compass of the show.

    Video Games 

-   _Castlevania_: The Church throughout the franchise is usually a helpful organization that assists the vampire hunters in their adventures.
    -   _Castlevania II: Simon's Quest_: "To restore your life, shout in front of the church.", which means "Go inside and talk to the priest." Don't shout at buildings, man.
    -   The Catholic church which employs Yoko and Arikado in _Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow_ and _Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow_, keeping an eye out for strange supernatural happenings and intervening when it is demonic.
-   The Churches of the usually unnamed deity in the _Dragon Quest_ series are almost always kind and helpful, which stands to reason given more often than not God Is Good in _Dragon Quest_. Even on the rare occasion God Is Evil in though, its followers are not and will supply services like curing poison, reviving dead characters, and telling you many experience points until a character levels up. And in most games, the churches also function as the main Save Points completely free of charge. That's certainly one way to save your soul.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_ Throughout the series, the Temples of the Eight (later Nine) Divines are portrayed as uniformly benevolent. They are dedicated to the Aedric deities who sacrificed large portions of their divine power in order to create Mundus, the mortal plane. According to some interpretations of the myth, the Divines sacrificed so much power that they actually are _dead_, but "dream that they are alive" and can still influence events on Mundus through the faith of their followers. Worship of the Divines has been the official religion of the various Cyrodiilic Empires of Tamriel since the foundation of the first (where it was adopted as part of the Bargain with Heaven struck with the Aedra which allowed the First Empire to form). Their benevolence is in sharp contrast to the typically evil (or at least ill-intentioned) Daedric cults (though the Daedra themselves operate on a very Blue-and-Orange Morality) and Corrupt Churches like the Tribunal Temple.

-   _The Legend of Zelda_ The Temple of Time is the most famous and reoccurring example. It is always a safe place for Link because it has a wall around it, though it is open to all. Originally the sealed temple in Skyward Sword and was used as the Old One's home, and where Link places the Master Sword. Between Skyward Sword and Ocarina of Time Rauru repurposes it as the entrance to the sacred realm, making a Secret Room to hide the Master Sword and the sacred realm entrance, so that evil cannot steal the Triforce, and the Sealed Temple is renamed the Temple of Time. Tens of Thousands of years later it can be found in Breath Of The Wild, though it's in a much worse state due to the The Great Calamity
-   Several standalone churches in _Fallout 3_. The player can donate to them to increase their karma.
    -   Even the ones that get people killed are well-meaning and misguided (and you can make them realise the error in their ways)
    -   The Mormons, now called "New Cannanites" in _Fallout: New Vegas_ are portrayed as largely benevolent and always willing to offer help in the form of protection or medicine to anyone willing to put up with their preaching. They were almost completely wiped out after a tribe working for Caesar's Legion took advantage of Sacred Hospitality by getting them to open their doors to them and razing their town to the ground. Even their most infamous member, Joshua Graham, is portrayed as a force of good, albeit a very conflicted one.
-   The Light of Kiltia in _Final Fantasy XII_. Benevolent, politically-neutral (their priests are forbidden to engage in matters of the state), and deeply protective of refugees and pilgrims. It is implied, however, that in the mythology it shares with _Final Fantasy Tactics_ and _Vagrant Story_, its diminished political power allowed the Church of Glabados and the Müllenkamp cult to appear from within its ranks.
-   The Prontera Church in _Ragnarok Online_ is a force for good, training Novices as Acolytes who then become Priests: support classes that specialize in healing/buffing adventurers and fighting dark monsters with holy magic. Acolytes can also become Monks that fight with their fists. The Church is on cordial terms with the Prontera Chivalry and Castle, who train Knights and Crusaders.
-   Danette's parents were part of one of these in _Soul Nomad & the World Eaters_. One was a priest, the other a mage. Revya's group also protects one of these from Thurists.
-   Depending on who you ask: the Church of the Holy Light in _Warcraft_ 'verse. Their offshoot, the Scarlet Crusade, is less so. Disgruntled members of the Scarlet Crusade also have their own reformist organization, the Argent Dawn, which is an equal opportunity employer and even has high-ranking _undead_ members. They have been at least complicit in some pretty awful things though, because of being so tied to the Alliance.
    -   Also, again depending on who you ask, the Sisterhood of Elune. In general they appear benevolent and have done some very much objectively good things (like rescuing the Worgen). On the other hand, they rule Kaldorei society with an iron fist, are paranoid about arcane magic, and have a distinct tendency towards Fantastic Racism. While the Kaldorei certainly see the Sisterhood as this trope, not everyone else does.

-   The church of Nisan in _Xenogears_, led by Sophia as its Holy Mother.
-   The Church in Palm Brinks in _Dark Chronicle_ counts because its sole purpose is to allow you to recruit Priest Bruno. It also lets you get a few photos for the photography mini-game. You place a similar church in Balance Valley, which is where Priest Bruno eventually moves in. This one is much more important than the one in Palm Brinks, as it forms the basis for an important place of worship in Monica's time.
-   The Zedem church in _Startopia_ is old-fashioned and moralistic but seems genuinely well-intentioned, spreading the word by evangelism and its adherents being nonviolent ascetics. Much more importantly, they pay the administrator a _lot_ of moolah if you let them set up a church on your biodeck and bring in converts — a more high-risk, high-reward alternative to more secular alternatives of dealing with sinners.
-   The Church of the Holy Maiden in _La Pucelle_; although the game actually questions the notion of faith in gods at some points (and even their goddess, Poitreene, herself claims not to be perfect at one point ) the Church is still largely a force for good that cares for the people. On the other hand, their rivals, The Church of the Holy Mother, turns out to be a Religion of Evil in disguise but has more worshipers.
-   The monk and his church in _King's Quest II_ help Graham a great deal. The Fan Remake? Not so much...
-   _Shining in the Darkness_ has a church where you can save your game.
-   The Septian Church from the _Trails Series_ have a surprisingly squeaky clean record, with no real visible sign of corruption in any of the games. They also have quite a few combat-capable priests that manage to _avert_ going Knight Templar.
-   The Temple of Palfina in _Hexyz Force_. When they learn that Cecilia inherits Palfina's power, they throw all their support behind her despite her reputation as a slacker.
-   The temples (which seems to be an expy of the Catholic Church) in _Dokapon Kingdom_ cures you of your status ailments and serves as a checkpoint.
-   In the _Lufia_ series, churches serve as save points, and also have other functions such as teaching magic to party members.
-   The Chantry of the _Dragon Age_ series _tries_ to be this, it honestly does. Unfortunately, history has shown us that it is also self-important, intolerant, and extremely brutal in many of its methods, not to mention that on several occasions it has removed verses from the Chant of Light (their version of a holy book) in order to suit their political aims. By the end of _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, however, the player can do a lot to remedy this through their choices in the story and by influencing the appointment of the new Divine. They can also just as easily make things a whole lot worse.
-   The Church of the Harvest Goddess in the _Harvest Moon_ series. They're typically run by a kindly minister who will always listen to your troubles, even though you can often talk to the Harvest Goddess for yourself and see how she's doing. In the games set in Mineral Town (_Harvest Moon: Back to Nature_ and _Back To Nature For Girl_, and the _Friends of Mineral Town_ games), the church is a vital place where you can raise your friendship with the townspeople by confessing your sins, get cursed tools blessed to make them usable, and even get rare mushrooms from the pastor, who likes to garden a bit. In the Wii games (_Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility_ and _Harvest Moon: Animal Parade_), it plays host to several festivals, and you can use it in Animal Parade to pray for the wishes of the townspeople to come true.
-   _Octopath Traveler_, unusually for a JRPG, depicts religion positively. The Church of the Sacred Flame is an unambiguous force for good who worship the twelve benevolent gods of the world. Ophilia, one of the eight Travelers, is a full-fledged cleric who was adopted by the church's Archbishop years ago, and goes on a journey to rekindle the Sacred Flame, helping out everyone she finds along the way. The antagonists are instead a Religion of Evil who worship Galdera, the thirteenth god who turned on the others.
-   In _Fire Emblem_, light and healing magic are derived from faith and therefore the units that use them are typically members of the local church. As such, many of the religious institutions in the series are portrayed as forces for good, though the exceptions, as well as individual Sinister Ministers, do exist.
    -   _Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade_'s Saint Elimine's Church has the distinction of being so far the only major religion that has been portrayed as outright benevolent; the villains that come from the Church are shown as traitors that joined Arcard or Roartz.
    -   In _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_, the Church of Seiros does have its problems, but is ultimately dedicated to upholding order in Fódlan. On three of the four routes, they ally with you to bring an end to the war that dominates Part II.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Terinu_ The Holy Den Mother is almost universally worshiped by the Vulpine and is generally portrayed as a benevolent Mother Nature.

    Web Original 

-   _Critical Role_:
    -   As Sarenrae is the goddess of healing and redemption, her clerics are pleasant folk. Her temple in Emon, for instance, is always open to those in need. They charged 100 gold for a Greater Restoration on Tiberius but only to cover the cost of the spell component (diamond dust) and nothing at all for diagnosing/disinfecting Vex's vampire bite or the bit of glissfoil Keyleth requested.
        
        **Cleric of Sarenrae**: We're happy to heal.
        
    -   The Platinum Dragon/Bahamut is more about sending out his paladins to smite evil For Great Justice. His Platinum Sanctuary is nigh-unanimously recognized as the safest place to seal away dangerous artifacts like the Horn of Orcus.
-   In the Forest Bed, the Servants of Voice seem to fill the social niche of Christianity, running schools, hospitals, and orphanages. Note that their goddess Voice is the lady of the underworld.

    Western Animation 

-   The Air Nomads in _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ are heavily implied to have been a Buddhist-inspired variation of this, mostly according to the backstory and a lot of Word of God. They used all the money they made to support others, they fought only in self-defense, and the last surviving Air Nomad, the eponymous Last Airbender, makes reference to various Air Nomad wisdom from time to time. It's notable that as a whole, they were so spiritual that their entire culture could Airbend, while in the other Nations only a certain percentage can, though this may be related to their small population.
    -   This is so much a part of airbender culture that in one late episode when Aang is conferring with his past incarnations to try and find a relatively peaceable solution to the problem of Fire Lord Ozai, he has a Heroic BSoD when the previous Air Nomad, Avatar Yangchen, admits that killing Ozai is the best solution available to Aang. When a method to deal with Ozai without killing him presents itself, Aang takes it without question, even though he's risking his soul to do so.
