Painfully shy and quiet, the Shrinking Violet is the withdrawn character, usually but not always female, who walks through the school hallways with her head down and wants nothing more than to blend in with the scenery to avoid all attention because she believes that her presence is worthless or unwanted. Often The Quiet One. Expect her to apologise a lot. She will usually be better than average in scholastic classes, and her appearance will often be pretty in a bookish sort of way, although not all shrinking violets need to be geniuses or nerds. Bonus points if she has long dark hair that hides her eyes.

The reasons for her (lack of) self-confidence vary, but they usually include intimidation (or bullying) by the popular ones, or being the youngest and more sheltered daughter in the family, or in more dramatic cases, a personal event that convinced her that the world would be better off if she just shut up. In other cases, the Shrinking Violet actually manages to avoid the brunt of fights or taunts that more vocal outcasts take, presumably because she's so quiet that she might as well be invisible.

Some Shrinking Violets will accept their status, but be plagued with that nagging feeling that they can be more than they assume. Other Shrinking Violets will hate their crippling insecurities and want to reach out to others, but be paralyzed by fear of rejection. Some start out hating their fears, but learn that Fear Is Normal. Unlike The Snark Knight, they didn't choose to be alone, but feel powerless to change it. They may even harbor a secret crush on a popular male classmate, or even on a male classmate who frequently gets picked on, which they, time and time again, cannot spit out. Prone to blushing. Some versions may be Prone to Tears as well, while others are better at repressing their emotions.

One advantage to being the Shrinking Violet is that, being outside the viciously popular circle, the few friends she manages to make are the loyal, lifelong ones who'd give their right arms to help a true friend in need. Which they will, because the Shrinking Violet is invariably of the sweet-tempered, delicate type who makes a great friend and a lousy criticism taker from the Alpha Bitch or her Girl Posse.

In the end, the Shrinking Violet will always find her inner beauty and strength with the help of her newfound friends (or lover), Grow a Spine, and blossom into a mature, self-confident woman who would make her parents proud. Well... not always. But generally. Sometimes the shy exterior remains towards strangers, and it's only the new friend (and the audience) who gets to see the wonderful person inside. The Beautiful All Along discovery is optional, but highly recommended.

In stories taking place in an Asian-like place, particularly Japan, the Shrinking Violet may grow into a Yamato Nadeshiko; still unassuming and possibly quiet, but no longer weak. Silk Hiding Steel is another possibility, which her reputation as this trope will strengthen.

In rare cases, a Shrinking Violet's mousiness will conceal a malevolent and/or violent personality. Sometimes, this is also used to conceal the extremely creepy Uncanny Valley Girl.

A male version of this trope may be treated as an instant Butt-Monkey for everyone to martyr, or just called out as an emo (unlike the female one, who is so sympathetic that beating her up or even yelling at her is akin to a MAJOR offense for her friends), or he might be given the role of sympathetic Plucky Comic Relief and overlap with a Lovable Coward. A male Shrinking Violet protagonist will usually face a conflict that finally forces him to come out of his shell, or he'll be thrown headlong into sociability and adventure at the start of the series by a Genki Girl, Magical Girlfriend, or Manic Pixie Dream Girl. However, straight examples are not uncommon, especially for younger boys.

Shrinking Violets are often associated with cool colors, especially violets/purples and sometimes blue, in their clothes, eye, or hair color. See also Shy Blue-Haired Girl.

If two Shrinking Violets fall in love with each other, expect them to be Twice Shy.

    Music 

-   mothy's song Daughter of White (and hell, the character of Clarith in general) is a major one of these.
-   Queen's "Sheer Heart Attack" seems to describe one of these, with the lyrics "Well you're just seventeen, all you wanna do is disappear..."
-   Alessia Cara's debut single "Here," written after realizing how much she hates parties and large crowds.
    
    Right next to the boy who's throwing up/Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more/Oh God why am I here?
    

    Podcasts 

-   Yuki from _Sequinox_ is rather shy, especially when it comes to people she has a crush on. When she's fighting in her Magical Girl form as Winter, though, she becomes a Large Ham.

    Roleplay 

-   _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues:_
    -   Harriet is withdrawn, self-loathing, and feels she doesn't deserve the attention or love of others. She frequently appears to be skittish, and her dialogue contains a lot of ellipses.
    -   Ivy is shy, introverted, has a stutter, hates standing out, and has strong self-esteem issues. While she can stand up for herself, or for her friends, the moments are few and far-between.
    -   Jenna is quiet, shy, and tends to fret over the little things. This has worsened since she gained her power, which turned her into a mass of insects and all but forced her to constantly hide herself with a hoodie.
    -   Josephine is very reclusive, and suffers from a low self-esteem and distrust of others. She fears that people will think she's annoying if she tries socialising with them. She can barely even manage to say hello when she comes across Hyeon.
-   Gloria Benson in V4 of _Survival of the Fittest_. She's always whispering, stuttering, _and_ blushing when she speaks. Even when she talks to her friends, she's painfully shy/quiet, and keeps apologizing for what she says. Lucy Ashmore, also from v4, qualifies as well. She's just as shy, due to bullying. Sometimes this slides into Cute Clumsy Girl territory as well, due to her nervousness.
-   _We Are Our Avatars_: At first, Marcia did not like talking with the others. But she warms up to them and becomes more friendly over time.

    Theater 

-   Laura from _The Glass Menagerie_ fits this to a T. She is so shy that she cannot leave the house or get a job, and (hooray symbolism) spends a lot of time caring for her collection of fragile, delicate glass animals.
-   Some productions of _Hamlet_ play Ophelia this way.
-   The titular character of _Dear Evan Hansen_ is a male example, with his severe social anxiety and low self-esteem leaving him fitting this trope perfectly.

    Web Animation 

-   _Ayasaki-san_: Miyu acts cool in front of everyone, but she's actually shy in front of Chiaki.
-   _DC Super Hero Girls_:
    -   Miss Martian is this way. When introduced to Wonder Woman in episode 1 she turns invisible and she later does the same when Poison Ivy tries to talk to her. Apparently this is common for her and the only person she seems fine around is Starfire.
    -   Poison Ivy (who, in this series, is an introverted but kind-hearted girl rather than an Eco-terrorist), is, rather appropriately, this. She even admits at one point she is a "plant person, not a people person."
-   _DSBT InsaniT_: Paper Boy is incredibly meek and stutters when he talks.
-   _Manga Soprano_:
-   _Sekai No Fushigi_: Momose isn't flashy lacks confidence in herself in contrast to her friend Kitegawa. This leads to men taking advantage of Momose because of her passiveness which leads Kitegawa to protect her. When Saejima fell in love with her, Kitegawa tried to keep him away from Momose, but soon warmed up to him after seeing his sincere love for her.

    Web Videos 

-   _The Autobiography of Jane Eyre_: Jane is a quiet and lonely girl who doesn't have any friends and any good family. She's nice, but has No Social Skills. It's quite unusual that such a girl would start vlogging and sharing her life with the internet. She considers it a challenge and a brave thing to do, and she would like to get some help from her viewers.
-   Subverted in _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_. The title character is painfully shy, and has been quietly in love with a girl from his laundromat for months. Ironically, his alter ego is a megalomaniacal villain who wants to rule the world.
-   In _Hi I'm Mary Mary_, Mary avoids showing her face in full in the series, citing the fact that she's shy.
-   lifeattheextremes has documentaries on what it's like to have the DSM recognized personality disorders including the avoidant.
