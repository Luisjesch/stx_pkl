**T-Rex:** Wow! The plants are nice and the birds are singing and the sun is almost down from the top of the sky. What a beautiful day!  
**Dromiceiomimus:** But T-Rex, what if beauty is nothing but an illusion? What if we're all nothing but dreams within dreams that, for an instant, imagine themselves to be real?  
**All:** OH SHIIIIIIII\-

Sometimes serious, but often a comedy trope. When faced with something, most or all cast members in the scene _panic_. Related to Crowd Panic, except it's not about the Living Prop characters. Expect The Stoic or Only Sane Man to get everyone to shut up for long enough to deal with the problem, if they don't and panic just like everyone else, the scenario is definitely treated seriously.

This trope name doesn't mean an actual mass of fecal matter, but it's not necessarily unrelated to Bring My Brown Pants.

    Literature

    -   _Prince Caspian_, Aslan's roar:
        
        "Aslan, who seemed larger than before, lifted his head, shook his mane, and roared. The sound, deep and throbbing at first like an organ beginning on a low note, rose and became louder, and then far louder again, till the earth and air were shaking with it. It rose up from that hill and floated across all Narnia. Down in Miraz’s camp men woke, stared palely in one another’s faces, and grasped their weapons. Down below that in the Great River, now at its coldest hour, the heads and shoulders of the nymphs, and the great weedy-bearded head of the river-god, rose from the water. Beyond it, in every field and wood, the alert ears of rabbits rose from their holes, the sleepy heads of birds came out from under wings, owls hooted, vixens barked, hedgehogs grunted, the trees stirred. In towns and villages mothers pressed babies close to their breasts, staring with wild eyes, dogs whimpered, and men leaped up groping for lights. Far away on the northern frontier the mountain giants peered from the dark gateways of their castles."
        
    -   _The Last Battle_: It happens when every thinking being in the world sees Aslan standing in a doorway. Good goes past him through the door to Heaven, and evil does not go through the door. Most approaching the door are completely terrified of him.
    -   In _The Voyage of the Dawn Treader_, the sailors react this way when they realize the implications of landing on the island where dreams come true. It sounds like an absolutely fantastic place...until you remember that nightmares are also dreams.

-   _Left Behind_: In _Glorious Appearing_, during the 'sheep and goats' judgement, this is the reactions of the unsaved and those who had taken the Mark of the Beast when Jesus condemns them to the Lake of Fire for never caring for poor, destitute and starving people.
    
    **Jesus Christ:** _"Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry, and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave Me no drink; I was a stranger, and you did not take Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick and in prison, and you did not visit Me. Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me. You will go away into everlasting punishment."_

    **Entire team:** Oh fuck.
    
-   In _The Wheel of Time_, the tenth book, _Crossroads of Twilight_ could be essentially summed up as 800+ pages of every channeler on the planet going through an _epic freak out._ Granted, it's because they're sensing enough of the One Power to "crack the world like an egg," and they don't know whether it's being used by the good guys or the bad guys. Though, eventually, several characters get tired of freaking out, and basically state that if the beacon of power was going to destroy the world, it would have done so already.
-   In _Worm_, this is the reaction to the realization that the Slaughterhouse Nine have arrived in the city by any teams that have found out before they announce their presence. Aftewards, it is the reaction of the rest of the city.

        -   Everyone at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields gets two of these back-to-back.

Then second when Halbarad unrolls the banner of Gondor, showing that Aragorn has defeated the Corsairs.
        -   The Dunlendings at Helm's Deep, when Gandalf arrives with reinforcements _behind_ their position. The only person who knew anything about this was Aragorn: and even he only knew Gandalf had some kind of plan, but not what it was.
        -   The inhabitants of the Shire when they realize who "Sharkey" is. Luckily, Wormtongue chooses that moment to literally stab him in the back.
    -   In _The Fall of Gondolin_, the people of the city are holding a night festival to celebrate the coming of the spring when they notice a faint red glow crowning the northern mountains.

A very frantic cleaning session immediately ensues.
-   In _Farscape The Peacekeeper Wars_, Crichton _finally_ gives the warring Skarrans and Peacekeepers exactly what they'd wanted from him for years: a wormhole weapon.

-   Miserable: This happens near the end of the video. After the giant woman eats bassist Kevin Baldes alive the surviving members of the band do this shortly before running for their lives. Jeremy even appears to be mouthing the F-word when it happens.

    Religion 

-   _The Bible_: Revelation 1:7 says this regarding Jesus' Second Coming:
    
    _Look! He is coming with clouds,_
    
    _and every eye will see Him,_
    
    _even those who pierced Him._
    
    _And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him._
    
    _Even so, Amen._
    

    Theatre 

-   The famous "silent scene" at the end of _The Inspector General_ by Nikolai Gogol is an _epic_, several minute long Mass "Oh, Crap!" moment, described in great detail, when the officials learn the guy they were buttering up was a phony, and the _real_ Inspector General wants to have a talk with the Mayor.

    Video Games 

-   This trope was the result of the original Leeroy Jenkins' charge into the Upper Blackrock Spire Rookery in _World of Warcraft_. It's also the reaction of the entire raid when a main tank dies unexpectedly or the boss hits his enrage timer. A smaller version happens during dungeon groups composed mostly of DPS (e.g. three rogues and a priest or shaman) with no main tank when the healer/heal tank dies.
-   _Wild ARMs_ had the Quarter Knights pull this off when Mother tells them about her true objectives. It was even worse in the remake.
-   _Final Fantasy VI_ has this when a message is brought to the Elder of Narshe about the Empire attack. Everyone present (the Elder, his men and all the player characters so far) take on their shocked face.
-   _Final Fantasy XIII_ has an excellent instance of this, with looks of abject horror from the entire party when Primarch Galenth Dysley reveals his true form as the fal'Cie Barthandelus.
-   From _Mass Effect 2_'s _Arrival_ DLC, the entire team at Project Arrival begins to panic when Shepard breaks through the sedatives and wakes up, and s/he is PISSED! Cue Curb-Stomp Battle.
    
    -   In the final mission of _Mass Effect 3_, Hammer Task Force is preparing to storm the Conduit, when Harbinger lands on the far side. The entire force panics, and makes a desperate charge. It almost works.
    -   Earlier on Mars, all of the Cerberus troops had this reaction upon realising _who_ the Alliance had sent.
    
    **Cerberus Trooper:** Holy shit! It's _SHEPARD!_
    
    -   The Reapers actually appear to do a double-take upon noticing the utterly _enormous_ fleet pouring through the Mass Relay, hellbent on retaking Earth and the Citadel from their control. How big is the fleet? Potentially, it's all of them. All the turians, all the krogans, all the quarians, all the geth, etc.
    -   From the tie-in Twitter feeds, the Reapers are implied to be having a collective Mass "Oh, Crap!" upon realising that none of their forces during the invasion of Earth have managed to confirm the whereabouts of "Hostile Target Shepard". Because that means Shepard is _still out there!_
-   In the _Fallout 4 Nuka-World_ DLC, there is the optional-quest "Open Season." In it, The Sole Survivor decides to _kill all the Raiders & their Bosses_ in Nuka-World and free all their captives. The moment that the Survivor kills the first Raider Boss, _every single raider_ in the park, even those of the different raider-factions, realizes what is happening and desperately try to kill the Sole Survivor, but since they know s/he is hunting them all down they all realize they are now completely screwed.
    -   In fact, the situation is so bad that the Nuka-World Disc-Jockey announces while on the air that he is _getting the hell out of the park_, and takes his radio show off the air permanently then-&-there.
-   In _I Miss the Sunrise_, this is the crew's reaction to encountering a jamming pulse for the first time. Justified, considering that it disables the safeguards that make Nonlethal Warfare nonlethal.
-   _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_: The reveal trailer for Sephiroth shows him illiciting shocked gasps and looks of utter horror from the playable cast (_especially_ Cloud) after Worfing Galeem.
-   Anytime World's Strongest Man Lu Bu appears in the _Dynasty Warriors_ games, expect every Mook and even some generals to react this way.
-   In _Dragon Age: Origins – Awakening_, you can induce this in a bunch of kidnappers if you imported a character from the original game by pointing out that you are the Hero of Ferelden. Some of them apparently jump off a cliff rather than face you.
-   In _Fantasy Life_, everyone in the royal court of Castele reacts this way to Yuelia showing off her human form in public for the first time. They do it again immediately afterward, but with Confused Question Marks appearing over their heads instead of exclamation marks when she tells them she's an angel, and one of the daughters of God.
-   In _BoxxyQuest: The Gathering Storm_, this tends to be the party’s reaction whenever STORM shows up, and for very good reason.
-   The _Trials of Mana_ remake has all of the characters in your group give this expression when they witness the power of the Black Rabite.
-   _Doom (2016)_: In the backstory, Samuel Hayden and the expedition exploring Hell first became interested in the temple holding the Doom Slayer's Sarcophagus because the demons started _panicking_ when they approached the place. They figured if something was in there that could scare the Legions of Hell half to death, they wanted it.
-   When Giratina comes out of the Distortion World because of Cyrus' actions at Spear Pillar in _Pokemon Platinum_, not only do Dialga and Palkia (Giratina's _siblings_) each take a step back, but the Lake Trio (Legendaries in their own right) visibly panic.
-   _Angry Birds 2_: The pigs collectively give a faint "Uh-oh!" when you use the Golden Duck and Mighty Eagle spells.
-   In _Mario Plus Rabbids Sparksof Hope_, everyone in the party (including Bowser and _Edge_ and excluding Rabbid Rosalina) freaks out upon seeing a giant Wriggler chasing them.
-   In _Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader_, the party's encounter with a Word Bearer Chaos Space Marine inspires a range of reactions ranging from It Has Been an Honor to outright _horror_ at the thing's gruesome psionic presence. The subsequent battle justifies it.

    Web Animation 

-   _Final Fantasy VII: Machinabridged_:
    -   A (semi-) serious example in Episode 25, when a brainwashed Cloud prepares to bring his Buster Sword down upon Aerith. The rest of his friends are understandably horrified.
    -   Happens again in the Finale Movie when Sephiroth goes One-Winged Angel, although strictly speaking, that instance is more of a Mass "This Is Gonna Suck".
-   _Super Mario Bros. Z_: Episode 6, when Mecha Sonic shows up, and again, when he does this. Luigi's Oh, Crap! expression is particularly epic.
-   _RWBY_:
    -   In Volume 2's "No Brakes", the Vale populace is bewildered when the White Fang's train bursts from the underground, with Team RWBY still dazzled from the impact. Then the Grimm emerge from the breach, causing a mass panic.
    -   Volume 3's "PvP" outdoes the previous entry by having _two_ such instances, and on an even larger scale. First, the world witnesses Pyrrha's accidental _murder_ of her opponent, Penny, with nobody able to control the broadcast. Second, the Grimm invade the kingdom of Vale _en masse_, with one giant Nevermore making its way to the stadium and the White Fang carrying more on board of their ships.
-   _Super-Hero-Bowl!_ had this in the third installment, _Super Showdown Bowl!_ when every single character, may it be heroes or villains, realize that Oscar the Big Bad had access to _all_ their powers.

    Webcomics 

-   In _8-Bit Theater_, the _entire universe_ goes Oh, Crap! when Black Mage becomes the ruler of Hell.

-   _Darths & Droids_ generally follows most of Jim's more unhinged plans with pictures of the other characters looking worried, concerned or pensive.
    
    **Jim:** (as Han) I'm out of my usual good ideas. I gotta try something crazy.  
    **Ben:** (as Chewie) :|  
    **Annie:** (as Leia) :|  
    **Sally:** (as C-3PO): I'm gonna sing the Doom Song now!
    
-   Inverted in _DM of the Rings_. When a massive troll attacks the group, they gleefully rush to finally kill something besides orcs.
-   _Dragon Ball Multiverse_: Pretty much everyone except Broly and Vegetto during their fight is freaking the _fuck_ out.
    -   Averted with Zen Buu, though. While he freely admits that the fight was impressive, he doesn't appear shocked, or even worried. That's _after_ he saw Vegetto go Super Saiyan 3.
-   This was the general reaction to Gilgamesh Wulfenbach of _Girl Genius_ incinerates a colossal war machine by calling lightning down from the sky. It wasn't a harbinger of doom for most of the characters who had their reactions depicted, but it certainly caused a city-wide double take and hanging jaw.
-   _Guilded Age_: After a highly explosive item ends up in an active volcano by accident, four of the five heroes present display some rather impressive Oh, Crap! expressions. The fifth, Gravedust, sticks with one that seems to say You Have GOT to Be Kidding Me!...
-   _The Order of the Stick_: In one of the strips (warning: spoilers!) we have the resistance scouting party's reaction when they return to base and find that not only have the villains overrun it, but _Redcloak himself_ is there.
    -   Another example: The remaining members of the Order, having just been through a lot are at a door a the end of a hallway when _Xykon_ opens it from the other side.
-   _Scandinavia and the World_: World War 3, here I come!
-   _Erfworld_: At one point, a war council shares a satisfied chuckle when their prediction - that an ally will soon betray them - is magically confirmed to be very likely. Then the implications set in.

    Web Videos 

-   In Achievement Hunter's "Let's Play Minecraft" episode one, we get this. Gavin, who had been playing the PC version of Minecraft before they went to the 360 version, disappeared to make a bucket and get some lava. He returns to find the house the others built...and dumps the lava on top of it. At that point, we have this reaction:
-   In _Counter Monkey_ Spoony describes this reaction from the party when they realize that the person they just threw a bottle of acid into the face of is not, as they thought, an evil cultist, but their current employer: Tempus Thales, the brutal, unkillable avatar of a war god. At their next session they're feeling optimistic that he'll get over it if they just stay out of his way, only to encounter this again when he reveals his hideously burned face to the city and declares a ten thousand gold bounty on the party member who threw the acid.
-   Almost everybody gets this reaction at the end of the _SuperMarioLogan_ episode "The Golden Egg!" after Jeffy wishes for the titular golden egg, which rendered it useless since he already had it at the time.
-   _Scott The Woz_ has a subdued instance of this trope in "Borderline Forever". After Team F\*cked's efforts to convince people the blue border is real fail, Jeb points out the error in judgement they just made:
-   During the _Mighty Nein_ campaign, the team encounter an old crone who cursed one of the Nein into a goblin form, and requests an 'exchange' of misery from one team member to another. Jester, the cheeriest of all the players has a rather _unusual_ play...
    
    "Jester": ''That cupcake was sprinkled with the Dust of Deliciousness, which makes any food taste far better... and also gives you disadvantage on Wisdom and Wisdom saving rolls. I then cast... _**Modify Memory**_...
    
    (the entire table): (silently losing their collective shit)
    
    -   The cherry on top is that the crone is a trickster who delights in others misery, while Jester is a Trickster Cleric who wields a _lollipop warhammer_. And she got the better of the old crone, with an enchanted cake. No wonder the table had this reaction.

    Western Animation 

-   _Back to the Future_: In "Gone Fishin'", Jules, Verne, and Marty all become jaw-droppingly horrified when they overhear the currently four-year-old Doc Brown's Uncle Oliver planning one final stunt for his nephew before "Daredevil Brown" retires from the business: going over a waterfall in a barrel.

-   The Team Squad has this reaction to Lord Commander turning into a Titan and _immediately_ killing Bolo by stabbing him and ripping his head off. When Gary and Quinn - who are in the loading bay - get back to the others, they are all looking shocked at Bolo's head floats by.
    
    **Sheryl**: Bolo...  
    **Little Cato**: HE KILLED BOLO!!!  
    **Avocato**: This... this can't be happening  
    **Bizkit**: Believe it. It's happening  
    **Gary**: We need to go GO GO GO!!!  
    **Little Cato**: _HE KILLED BOLO!!!_
    
    \* The final episode of _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_, "Goodbye to Bloo", ends with Mac stating that while he was going to move, he's only moving next door (rather than to another city, like the others first assumed), taking his former neighbor Louise's old apartment. Unfortunately, the new place where Louise herself is moving to doesn't allow imaginary friends, so she has to leave her friend, the much-maligned Cheese, at Foster's.
    
-   In the _Gravity Falls_ episode "Not What He Seems", Dipper, Mabel and Soos get this reaction after Dipper reads aloud The Author's notes about a mysterious machine that was referred to earlier as "doomsday device" by The Men in Black. The notes conclude with "If the clock ever reaches zero, our universe is doomed!" The clock in question is _only a minute and a half from zero._

-   _Legends of Chima_: the tribes' response to finding that Mt. Cavora has suddenly stopped flowing after they push back the Bat tribe swarm that was circling around it.
-   _Metalocalypse: The Doomstar Requiem_ has one in song:
    
    **Pickles:** Oh my god! Our old manager!  
    **Skwisgaar:** Oh my gods! My old guitar teacher!  
    **Nathan:** Oh my god! Our old groupies!  
    **Murderface:** Oh my god! A douchebag nightmare!
    
-   On _Moral Orel_ the main Running Gag is that some adult in Moralton will give Orel a piece of advice which he'll misinterpret, leading to him doing extremely bad things while trying to do good. When Reverend Putty finally realizes this root cause of so much havoc, he addresses the whole town, telling them, "The next person that inadvertently sends Orel Puppington down the wrong path could be responsible for damning all our souls". Everyone in town gulps simultaneously.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:

        -   The entire Mane Six have one when they realize they only have fifteen minutes until the inspector's train pulls in.

    -   At the end of Part 1 of the Season 6 premiere, "The Crystalling", when baby Flurry Heart unleashes a sonic cry that shatters the Crystal Heart, the reaction from the Mane Six and the Royal Family is one of absolute horror and shock, especially the looks on Celestia and Luna's faces as they've all just been put in mortal danger.
