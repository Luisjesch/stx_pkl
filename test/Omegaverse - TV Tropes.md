The Omegaverse, or the Alpha/Beta/Omega (A/B/O for short) dynamics universe is a setting originating from and primarily found in Fanfiction, most commonly of the Slash Fic variety. Finding its origin in _Supernatural_ Real-Person Fic, it quickly spread to other Fandoms and eventually to original Erotic Literature, Romance Novels, Manga and Manhwa. Although individual components of the Omegaverse like Mate or Die or Mister Seahorse are much older, the specific merging of tropes into one common setting started in The New '10s, making it one of The Newest Ones in the Book.

While some aspects are switched around, left out or added, the basic components stay the same: humans in this otherwise mostly normal setting, have an additional, just as important "dynamic" or second sex next to gender. Based on the now discredited concept of Alpha and Beta Wolves, alphas usually are dominant, aggressive and sport Exotic Equipment, while omegas are more submissive and might be able to get pregnant regardless of biological sex. Betas, who are just regular old humans, are often relegated to background characters, while the main focus of A/B/O stories is usually an alpha-omega couple. How the structure of society changes with the addition of the A/B/O types can also be handled quite differently from author to author. A/B/O type may be more important than gender, so alpha/omega couples are the norm, while an alpha/alpha heterosexual couple might be discriminated against. Often, there exists a Fantastic Caste System, where people of some type (most commonly omegas) are oppressed or one type is exceedingly rare and valuable. Other common components are pheromone emission and knowing their partner by scent, bonding for life and sexual heat cycles. When someone hides their type through behavioral changes or suppression medication, there might be some sort of Gender Reveal when they are found out.

Stories containing Omegaverse usually fall on the explicit side and can be either Porn Without Plot or Porn with Plot, but tamer works exploring the gender and societal dynamics (not unlike fiction from the New Weird movement) do exist and are not uncommon.

## Tropes frequently found in this setting include:

-   Bizarre Human Biology: Alpha Females and Omega Males are both hermaphrodites, while Alpha Males (and in some cases, Alpha Females) have a canine-like bulbus glandis.
-   Blanket Fort: Omegas are frequently stereotyped as "nesting", which are often depicted as small in-house forts made of pillows and blankets, which Omegas will often instinctively make when nervous or expecting.
-   Claimed by the Supernatural: Alphas will sometimes bite an Omega that they are physically or sexually attracted to in order to 'Claim' them, leaving a bite mark that will prevent the Omega from being attracted to anyone else (and prevent other Alphas from being attracted to the Omega).
-   Deliberate Values Dissonance: Often invoked by authors, since Omegas are often treated as second-class citizens with limited rights in comparison to Alphas and Betas (with treatment of Omegas often ranging from "Stay in the Kitchen" to being legally perpetual minors in the custodianship of an Alpha or Beta), and some Omegaverse stories are set in pre-modern times where this trope would be in force regardless.
-   Depending on the Writer: The mechanics, physiology, and reproductive anatomy of Alphas and Omegas can vary between authors.
-   Everyone Is Bi: Alphas and Omegas are as likely to be within a same-sex relationship as a heterosexual one — to the point that gay or lesbian Alpha/Omega couples are _much_ more common than heterosexual couples that are both Alphas or Omegas.
-   Fantastic Caste System: Alphas are often depicted as forming an Omegaverse society's upper or warrior classes, while Omegas are usually submissive and either an oppressed underclass (that often goes into hiding) or relegated to service and hospitality industries.
-   Fandom-Specific Plot: Omegaverse stories are as likely to be AU fanfics of pre-existing franchises as they are not.
-   Hermaphrodite: Both Omega Males and Alpha Females are fully-functional hermaphrodites with both sets of reproductive organs.
-   Homosexual Reproduction: Gay couples where one (or both) men are Omega Males, and lesbian couples where one (or both) women are Alpha Females, are as capable as procreating as a heterosexual couple.
-   Masculine–Feminine Gay Couple: Practically ubiquitous in same-sex Alpha/Omega pairings, with the Alpha being the more masculine partner and the Omega being the more feminine one.
-   Mating Season Mayhem: Omegas go into Heat whenever the ovulate, releasing a pheromone or odor that can induce Rut (a state of increased sexual arousal) in Alphas. Omegas are often incapable of controlling their heats, and Alphas are often incapable of controlling themselves when in rut.
-   Mindlink Mates: Some more overtly magical Omegaverse settings may depict Alphas as able to make telepathic connections to an Omega that they've 'Claimed'.
-   Mister Seahorse: Omega Males are as capable of getting pregnant as Alpha, Beta, or Omega females are. This trope is one of the most famously associated with Omegaverse, to the point of this trope being used as the definition of Omegaverse in Google Definitions, and the trope page on This Very Wiki has a brief summary of Omegaverse on the trope's fanfic examples page.
-   My Instincts Are Showing: Both Alphas and Omegas are often depicted as having animalistic instincts, especially when an Alpha is in rut or an Omega is in heat.
-   Non-Heteronormative Society: Some interpretations of the Omegaverse depict the setting as being entirely non-heteronormative, where same-sex couples aren't something to bat an eye at. Others will depict society as mostly heteronormative, but make a Bigotry Exception if one (or both) members of a gay couple are Omega Males, or if one (or both) members of a lesbian couple are Alpha Females.
-   Not Safe for Work: Given the Omegaverse's origins and strong associations with online erotica, an Omegaverse story being NSFW is pretty much given as a default.
-   Signature Scent: Alphas and Omegas have their own unique scents, the former of which can use to 'Claim' the latter.
-   Smart Animal, Inconvenient Instincts: A rare non-Furry and non-sapient-animal example, since Alphas and Omegas both have some animalistic instincts (mostly pertaining to rut/heat).
