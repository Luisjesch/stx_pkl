_"I simply LOVE this sensual feeling!"_

Sometimes, when a combat scene becomes a bit _too_ vocal and noisy... it stops sounding like fighting. The grunts and yelps and groans start to sound less like hostility and more like rough sex. Related to Cat Fight (and the possible cause of the related Fanservice). Of course, if you have a character that's Too Kinky to Torture, the moans may be genuine pleasure.

While in some cases this may be deliberate, interviews with actual voice actresses and vocal directors indicate that many seemingly clear cases of this are actually a case of Pareidolia, as the voice actress was nether directed to give such an impression nor actually trying to do so.

For those occasions when the characters actually are getting turned on, see Sex Is Violence, Combat Sadomasochist, and Interplay of Sex and Violence.

    Anime & Manga 

-   There are several episodes of the English dubbed _Angelic Layer_ that if you just black out the screen you would not believe it's a kids' anime. Especially since all the actors deliver their lines somewhat suggestively. (It doesn't help that there's actually a dominatrix doll complete with electro-whip.)
-   Grell Sutcliffe of _Black Butler_ during her battle with Sebastian.

-   Revy in _Black Lagoon_ tends to enjoy gunfighting a bit too much...
-   _Get Backers_: Takuma Fudou tends to have this, but only when he fights with Ban.
-   _Gonna Be the Twin-Tail!!_: Tail Yellow is an exhibitionist whose attacks involve losing pieces of her armor. It gets extreme enough to make one wonder how the show actually managed to pull a TV-14 rating in the US.
-   Fasalina of _GUN×SWORD_ has a tendency to moan and get excited as if having an orgasm while piloting her Humongous Mecha Dalia of Wednesday by _dancing_ on a stripper pole.
-   The Impaled with Extreme Prejudice defeat of Rip Van Winkle in _Hellsing_ is even worse in the OVA version, in which Maaya Sakamoto (perhaps deliberately) lets out a series of orgasmic moans. This gives the whole scene a soundtrack well suited for a hentai with imagery that's anything _but_ sexy. The English dub (and Kari Wahlgren) opted not to go this route.
-   _High School Of The Dead_ makes it clear that Saeko isn't "all there" when she gleefully recounts how she'd once beaten a would-be rapist within an inch of his life. Except it had nothing to do with him trying to rape her — she just liked the feeling of beating the ever-living crap out of someone with a wooden sword. Taken to its extreme, she literally achieves orgasm from it. Which is seen near the end of episode 9, where she gets off from Takashi crushing her breast and his 'take charge' attitude, which causes her to arch her back and moan. Then she hits the big "O" after cutting down a wave of zombies<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   The Tokyo Pop release of the _Ikki Tousen_ manga (_Battle Vixens_) added this as Dub Text for the Fighters.
    -   In the anime, Hakufu's first fight with Ryomou involves a certain chokehold that makes this, um, literal.
-   _Maken-ki!_: Yan-Min activates her "Reilii" by summoning her Jingu, which takes the form of a twin-tailed lash, then having both ends of it enter her body. The process causes her to arch her back and moan as if she's getting off from it, while Takeru gets a nosebleed watching it happen.
-   _Naruto_: Hidan is a literal sadist. His religion does encourage it to the utmost because its main commandment is total carnage and he has to ask Jashin for forgiveness when he isn't allowed to kill an opponent. It's strongly implied that he has an orgasm when he impales himself to finish off Asuma.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ gives us Tsukuyomi. Seriously, you could take the dialogue from the fight scene with Setsuna and replace it with porn and no one would know the difference.
-   _Queen's Blade_: Taken to literal extremes with Nyx, who allows her sentient staff, Funikura, to tentacle rape her in exchange for magical power. During which, it forces one of its tendrils into her mouth and makes her swallow several large mouthfuls of what appears to be semen. She's usually mortified once the effect has worn off, but definitely seems to enjoy it as it's happening.
-   _Reborn! (2004)_: Belphegor, during his battle with Gokudera.
-   In the DiC English dub of _Sailor Moon R_ when Serena is fighting Wise Man with the Silver Crystal.
-   One of the reasons why _Witchblade_ has such a fantastic dub is because the English VAs made the combat scenes sound even more orgasmic and sexual, which is impressive considering what Mamiko Noto gets up to in some of her other roles. Of course, the Japanese version comes across merely as not unequivocably blatant. It's still far past "subtle".

    Comic Books 

-   In _Grimm Fairy Tales 2018 Cosplay Special_, Skye Mathers is ambushed in the changing room of a costume store by a skinwalker. The sounds of combat invoke this response in the substance-addled store clerk who comments "Sounds like someone's having fun".
-   This turns into Destructo-Nookie (not seen of course) in _The Prisoner of White Agony Creek_.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   In the French movie _8 Women_, Catherine Deneuve and Fanny Ardant get into a Cat Fight, and roll on the floor trying to pin each other down. Before long they aren't so much fighting as fondling one another.
-   In the first film adaptation of _Carrie (1976)_, Margaret White's moans and cries as she is crucified with a lot of carving knives by her own vengeful daughter sounds like she's either having one hell of an orgasm or experiencing religious rapture. Both possibilities were probably completely on purpose, considering her character.
-   In _District 9_, the first sign that something is seriously wrong with Koobus is the breathy laughter and orgasmic sigh he lets out when he shoots an alien point-blank.
-   _Fight Club_. The film plays constantly with the suggestion that the club members are lusting after each other, getting off on the fighting in a sexual way, and possibly even screwing offscreen. Most of the fight scenes are heavily sexual, and there are some scenes between the two main characters which are rather racy, in a combative way. (\*cough\* the gun \*cough\*)
-   _James Bond_:
    -   _Never Say Never Again_: Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera) gets a little _too_ excited by killing, especially Bond's assistant.
    -   _GoldenEye_: Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen) is downright overt about it, calling deadly combat "foreplay". A notable example is when she guns down an entire roomful of technicians and officers at Severnaya with a Kalashnikov, moaning with pleasure while doing so (crosscut with Natalya's panicked breathing). Followed by a truly great Eye Take from General Ourumov.
-   Just watch this _Rush Hour 3_ sequence...
-   _Undercover Brother_ has the Cat Fight in the shower between Sista Girl and White She Devil.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the _Doctor Who_ story "The Evil of the Daleks", the Daleks shove Victoria into a body scanner to check her health. This appears to be a painful experience for her at first, but her expressions slowly change<small>◊</small>...
-   Rod and Tara's duels in _Double the Fist_ invoke this to build up the Unresolved Sexual Tension between them. Their ridiculously brutal over-the-top duels are the only scenes where they show respect and genuine affection for each other, and both seem to enjoy it entirely too much whenever the other lays them out with a particularly badass move.
-   A somewhat stomach-turning variation occurs in an episode of _Jonathan Creek_, where it turns out that a close-up video of a woman's face in apparent sexual rapture was actually a recording of her murder, with a pitchfork as the weapon no less.
-   One episode of _The Nanny_ has Fran and Maxwell playing orgasmic ping pong. (And no, this is _not_ a euphemism for something.)
-   In _Rome_, Titus Pullo and Gaia perform this trope in the kitchen...
-   During the _Smallville_ Season 8 finale, Lois Lane gets into a Designated Girl Fight with resident Dark Action Girl Tess Mercer. They end up wrestling on a desk, their bodies pressed firmly against each other, and grunting in precisely the sexy-sounding way that this page's opening text describes. The fact that this was the culmination of an entire season's worth of Homoerotic Subtext and Foe Romance Subtext (well, at least on Tess's part) just made it fit this trope even more. When Season 9 premiered a few months later, Tess actually lampshades this, noting that "Things _did_ get a little physical," wiggling her shoulders suggestively...and then she asks Lois whether she'd like to "pick up where we left off." Lois declines.
-   In the _Supernatural_ episode "Devil May Care" (S09, Ep02), sounds of moaning and grunting come from a rocking van while Tracy beheads a vampire inside the van.
-   The fight scene in the Kiss Kiss Bang Bang episode of _Torchwood_, between Jack and John.

    Music 

-   In Samsas Traum's "Der Froschkönig", the screaming while the frog king is killed by wolfes also sounds like... something else.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   WWE is particularly bad when it comes to its Diva matches.
-   Male example: Bubba Ray of the Dudley Boyz was often said to have a 'euphoric look' in his eyes by the commentators after dropping a victim through a table (that was kind of the team's thing in the WWE). He didn't discriminate much about what gender the person was, either.

    Sports 

-   Tennis. The sport is notoriously accompanied by constant grunting, which often leads to this kind of association.
    
    -   As shown in this video, Rafa Nadal has the habit of grunting every time he hits the ball. It's gotten more than one girl flustered.
    -   The Williams sisters. Robin Williams points it out:
    
    _"Tennis used to be <click>_ (softly) _'Oh!' <click>_ (softly)'' 'Oh!' And then the Williams sisters started playing tennis: AIIGH! AIIGH! AIIGH! 'Forty-love.' 'Naw, that's good love, baby.'" <mimes smoking a cigarette>
    
-   Women's fencing at the Olympics also gets a lot of added appreciation from the male audience.
-   Women's curling sounds particularly awkward when you aren't paying attention.
    -   **All** curling can have that effect - in order to get the team to sweep a rock so that it holds its line (just go with it), the skip will often call out "Hard!" or "Harder!" followed by "Hurry!" It gets better in combination. "Hurry! Hurry hard! Harder! Harder! Yes!"
        -   Followed often by "Whoa, that's good" to get them to stop. When can then be followed by any number of potentially compromising statements, positive ("Nice!" "Sweet!" "Good lie!") or negative ("Rough shot!" "Bad curl," and the like - or even "Caught a hair" for a shot that went unexpectedly off-kilter).

    Video Games 

-   Some of the Japanese voices from _Aion_ are quite... disturbing.
-   If you listen to the sound files of the Reyvateils in battle in _Ar tonelico II: Melody of Metafalica_, you'll quickly notice how they sound like they're... you know... Like, when they say something along the lines of "Give me more!", "This power... it's flowing inside me!!", or "It's overflowing!" Bonus points with the fact that they also moan, groan and scream as such.
-   _Batman & Robin_ for the Tiger Game.Com. Listen to it here starting at 13:40.
-   _Batman: Arkham Series_:
    -   Poison Ivy is already an alluring sex bomb throughout _Batman: Arkham Asylum_. But during the final boss battle with her, she definitely makes some... interesting noises when you attack the giant plant she's fused with. The whole imagery is also strongly vaginal.
    -   Catwoman's shrieks of pain in _Batman: Arkham Knight_ sound more like she's on the verge of climaxing.
-   Play _Baldur's Gate_ with a fully female party and cast a fireball at the party's feet: like an audio clip from a lesbian orgy.
-   _Bayonetta_. And not just the title character. Of course, the game deliberately set out to _parody_ characters such as _Devil May Cry 4's_ Gloria, so it's to be expected. It becomes obvious it is a parody when you discover that Bayonetta can defeat Joys by using a Wooden Horse and an S&M routine.
-   _BlazBlue_:
    -   Litchi Faye\-Ling. Seriously, hit her with a combo with your eyes closed and listen to those supposed moans of pain.
    -   It gets worse if you pit her against fellow Ms. Fanservice Noel Vermillion. Then, you have Litchi's sensual-sounding moans with Noel's meek cries and apologising. It sounds like lesbian pornography.
-   Probably due to bad voice acting and such, in _Bloody Roar 4_, if you keep on hitting Nagi after you beat her, she'll let out an... uh... rather uncanny moan as if for sex...
-   _Brütal Legend_: Emperor Doviculus sometimes makes outright moans of pleasure when hit. Given that he's the leader of the S&M-themed Tainted Coil, it's obviously intentional.
-   Appropriately, the female enemies in the Lust circle of _Dante's Inferno_ are quite, ahem, _vocal_ during combat, but their squicktastic design deters from the fetish appeal quotient considerably.
-   The male player character in _Dark Souls_ makes some very sensual grunts when being hit.
-   _Destiny of the Doctors_, a _Doctor Who_ game: the Fifth Doctor's moans as he gets tortured by the Master are quite... something. Close your eyes for maximum effect.
-   Gloria's first appearance in _Devil May Cry 4_. Someone who posted the scene on YouTube actually said "I hope I don't get in trouble for posting porn."
    -   To say nothing, of course, of the Lucifer acquisition scene. "First, I whip it out! Then I _thrust it_!"...
-   _Diablo_
    -   Moreina (the Rogue) has some unusual "gethit" grunts before she screams a drawn-out death noise which contrasts with the Sorcerer/Jazreth's old man "Daaaughh!!!" and the Warrior/Aidan's "Augh-oofh!" death sounds.
    -   The Sorceress/Isendra in _Diablo II_ has some rather soft-sounding grunts whenever she's hurt compared to the more pained sounds of other characters, followed by that weird "Aaaaaahh...!" she sometimes rattles out upon death compared to the other, more genuine death screams.
-   Go listen to the Korean voice lines for the Academic from _Dragon Nest_.
-   In _Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth_ and _Etrian Odyssey Nexus_, assigning the "Sultry" voice to a character gives them some very suggestive lines. In the English dub, only available in _Beyond the Myth_, this leads to lines like "Things are getting _steamy!_" (when several other party members are dead) and "Does it _hurt?_" (when using certain attacks). In the Japanese dub, you get several flirty giggles, and a pleasure-filled moan when activating a Force Boost.
-   In _The Evil Within 2_ you fight a large number of decidedly female monsters which make a variety of noises, from croaking akin to Ju-on, to singing eerily like a child, and occasionally moans and grunts. Most of these are innocuous enough, typical monster grunts and moans, but a boss called Obscura who is a conglomeration of different female bodies and an old-fashioned camera, is another story. Every movement and every attack she makes sounds like some sort of audio excerpt from a video that asks if you're 18 or older before viewing. So much so that certain online gamers have noted it while fighting her.
-   Vanille from _Final Fantasy XIII_. Slight moans for pretty much ANY attack EVER. Due to her emotional \* gasps\* being similar, it's unclear if she gets pleasure from fighting or just has constant arousal. Then, if there was ever any doubt, her final move with her Eidolon has to be seen and heard to be believed (Here).
    -   Her "combat" sounds during her summon are even _better_ (or worse?) in English.
-   When any character in _Siren 1_ starts to get tired, he or she will begin to... pant. This includes Tomoko and Miyako, who are 14, and Harumi, who is **8**.
-   Hotaru Futaba in _Garou: Mark of the Wolves_ has basically an explosive orgasm as a super move.
-   In _Guilty Gear_, I-No gets really into it, including making sexual comments when she defeats the player.
    -   Further, if I-No fights Dizzy, whose battle cries involve her begging her uncontrollable powers to stop, it sounds like rape.
    -   And then there's Raven. He is an extreme masochist thanks to his immortal body and his otherwise mostly-dulled sensations and as such makes some... Interesting sounds when hit. Especially when he invites it on himself.
-   The female Rebels' pain sounds in _Half-Life 2_. Probably not very noticeable while you're playing, but you'll definitely hear it if you go into the sound files and listen to them on their own. Especially one after another.
-   In _Heroes of Might and Magic II_, start a melee fight between Steel or Iron Golems and Archers. Then _listen_...
    -   _Grunt!_ "Aah!" _Grunt!_ "Aah!"
    -   Also when a stack of archers/rangers dies, they let out a sigh that sounds more like a mid-coitus whimper than a death whimper.
-   Black Orchid in _Killer Instinct_. In both the first game and the sequel, whenever you injure her, you may as well ask if she wants a cigarette after.
-   In _League of Legends_ if you kill Ahri her death cries (_especially_ in Chinese) all sound like she just had a climax, and even sighs softly in most of them as if she's enjoying the afterglow. Considering she's based on a Gumiho and half her normal voice clips are flirting with her summoner, the other half talking about seducing and killing her foes, this was probably intentional.
-   _Left 4 Dead_ and _Left 4 Dead 2_ have had interesting... edits with the character sound files.
    -   At his death, the Smoker sometimes gives what sounds like a sigh of relief. Sometimes he even says "Yay!"
    -   And the same goes for _Team Fortress 2_, another Valve game.\[1\].
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_, Link's battle and stamina pants and moans are far from subtle, _especially_ heavy lightning damage and he makes them constantly. You can hear a lot of them here.
-   _LEGO Adaptation Game_:
    -   _LEGO Batman_. Not a combat example, but the sounds which come up whenever a character grabs onto a climbable ledge can easily be quoted out of context. Yes, even with Robin.
    -   All the LEGO Adaptation Games, in fact. Although in most of the others, it's when you start _pushing_ a _pushable object_ across the _special pushable object area_.
-   Amon in _Lufia: Curse of the Sinistrals_ says this in a...oddly-enthusiastic tone:
    
    **Amon:** "When it hurts...it hurts!"
    
-   _Marvel vs. Capcom 3_ contains both an intentional and most likely unintentional example. Morrigan in either language does this _very_ intentionally. As for the unintentional one... switch Chun-Li's voice to Japanese. You're welcome.
    -   By the same token as Morrigan, Lilith from _Darkstalkers 3_ has win quotes that are **incredibly** suggestive. Makes sense, considering she was born from Morrigan's soul, but nonetheless can be quite squicky.
-   Done lots of times in _Metal Gear Solid_, which is interested in the intersection between violence and the fanservice with which it's handled when watching a movie or playing it in a video game. It's most common in the first game and most obvious with Gray Fox (Snake's best friend, shouts "Hurt me more!!" a lot), but Sniper Wolf ("I'm going to send you a love letter. A bullet, straight from my gun to your heart."), Liquid Snake (why does he take his shirt off to beat Snake to death? Why does he take _Snake's_ shirt off to beat Snake to death?), Revolver Ocelot (long silver bullets, etc., etc) and Vulcan Raven (running around an arena, grunting and panting) all do this. Shows up less often afterward, with the exception of Python in _Portable Ops_, the BB Corp members in _4_, and Vamp in both _2_ and _4_.
-   The _Metroid Prime Trilogy_ averted this for the first two installments, as most of Samus's reactions to taking damage sounded just like ordinary grunts or quiet exhalations. Then the third game came around, and while it kept a few of the previous SFX, it also added _much_ louder moans/screams from her that sounded like something very pleasant had happened between her legs...
-   In _Neverwinter Nights_, a lot of the grunts and such in combat sound very, very strange when strung together incorrectly. The author of _A Dance with Rogues_ (a Hotter and Sexier module for _Neverwinter Nights_) didn't actually need to get new sound effects for the sex scenes.
-   Sylvia Christle lampshades this about Travis Touchdown in _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_.
    
    "All you feel is ecstasy when you kill. It's like you're getting off. Seriously...you need help."
    
-   In _Ōkami_, Waka's mini-boss fights involve you deflecting the swords he launches at you with Power Slash. When he's hit by one of those, he makes a rather interesting noise... Of course, it's not all that interesting, but it's gained so much Memetic Mutation that you can't avoid looking at it as this.
-   In _Overwatch_, some of the female characters make the occasional suggestive moaning sounds when they're killed, notably Mercy and D.Va. In an interview with some of the voice actors, the voice director said it could get "too sexy" and she had to tone it down a bit. To her credit, there's only a handful of death cries that sound sensual. However, the sounds made by most heroes when they're burning plays this trope straight.
-   All female sand monsters in the _Prince of Persia: Sands of Time_ trilogy. The ninja-type women actually say innuendos — repeatedly — when you fight them.
    -   The female enemies in _Prince of Persia: Warrior Within_ are probably the most obvious ("So much pleasure in pain.")
-   In _Quake II_ the Iron maidens make a lot of gasping and moaning noises
-   Nearly _every_ Real-Time Strategy game's "painful grunt" quotes when put together sound like this, it doesn't sound as bad in the game itself as you only hear one grunt.
-   The opening of _Resident Evil – Code: Veronica_.
-   All of the _Rumble Roses_ girls.
-   In _RuneScape_, the female players and humanoids gasp suggestively when they are hit.
-   _Severance: Blade of Darkness_: Blade Of Darkness has Amazon as one of four playable characters, and every sound she makes when performing the attack or receiving damage sounds like she's having a powerful orgasm.
-   Amy Rose in most _Sonic The Hedgehog_ games in which she's playable. _Sonic Adventure_ actress Jennifer Douillard was especially fond of this, although it still exists in a toned-down form nowadays.
-   In _Splatoon 2_, some of the pained sighs and moans made by male Octolings upon getting splatted or submerging while injured can most definitely be taken out of context. Furthermore, male Octolings have slightly more effeminate appearances and mannerisms when compared to their Inkling counterparts. This has led to many bara jokes among fans.
-   The Xbox 360 port of _Soulcalibur_ lent itself to this, or at least the Japanese dub did.
-   Juri in _Super Street Fighter IV_ seems to be leaning in this direction.
-   The eroge fighting game series _Strip Fighter_ is full of this, naturally. Even the few playable male characters have some rather suspicious battle cries. This comes full circle with the characters Iku and Riyona, who both are ascended extras from software used to put together erotic dialogue. To that end, Iku’s battle cries are nothing _but_ moans. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Though this is downplayed with Riyona, who also has typical fighting game voices alongside her more naughty ones.
-   _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_:
    -   Normally, the characters sound like they're fighting and there's nothing sensual about it. However, in sound test mode, if you go through a character's voice sounds in sequential order, they make all kinds of varying grunts and yelps which gradually increase in volume, culminating with your character's death cry: an extended scream. All of these sound files are played with no background music with echo effects turned on, so that if you close your eyes (or someone is listening from the next room) it starts to sound like hentai or something. Snake and the princesses are prime examples.
    -   Marth's Star KO scream sounds like he just had a massive orgasm.

-   Certain human enemies in the _Tales Series_, usually bosses, make grunts that may sound at least slightly sexual. The player characters do this too.
-   In _Tekken 3_ (not sure about the others), Nina sometimes sounds like she's doing something other than fighting after being hit by an opponent. It's more noticeable in end-of-round/match replays which occur in slow-mo, thus distorting the sound somewhat and drawing it out.
-   In _Tekken 4_, Christie Monteiro exhibits this trope, particularly her loud moans after being defeated.
-   All deaths of female characters in _TimeSplitters_.
-   _Unreal Tournament 2004_ had an announcer that was In Love with Your Carnage up to the point that she was having an Immodest Orgasm if you managed to score a Monster Kill.
-   In _Warhammer Online_, some people find the women's screaming in combat is rather disturbingly similar to The Immodest Orgasm.
-   Go fight a female Vrykul in _World of Warcraft_.
    -   Not to mention Paletress.
    -   Male human NPCs also sound a smidge too relieved when they die.
    -   Maiden of Virtue
    -   The Succubus, of course. Particular their death cries.
        -   Of course, for demons Death is Cheap, so for succubi, it's just a little death.
    -   We can probably add the Dryads here as well, sadly as enemies they are very rare, and appear only in a few places, such as Maraudon and the Nexus.
-   Many, _many_ characters on the English voice track of _Yggdra Union_. May or may not be because either the voice acting or the voice directing was _really, really bad_, as the Japanese voices don't sound anywhere near as sexual.
    -   A few monsters in its spiritual prequel, _Riviera_, have death cries that sound like this. Even with the Japanese voices.

    Web Animation 

-   Bit of a meta example in the case of _RWBY_. The crew acknowledges that while the girls are recording their yells and grunts for battle there's two ways they can sound: Like they're having sex or like they're taking a poo.
    -   Blake in particular tends to be pretty vocal when she's fighting, especially in the "Black" trailer, and it definitely sounds like this trope.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   Sun Ce and Taishi Ci's fistfight in _Farce of the Three Kingdoms_ is filled with double entendre. It's heavily implied that they bang for real when Taishi Ci surrenders.
-   Spoofed in ProZD's skit "when a game's audio is more suggestive than you realize", where Archibald's voice lines ("I'm coming!" "I'm finished") sound suggestive.
-   _Tales of MU_: "STOP! HAVING! ORGASMS! WHILE! I! AM! DEFEATING! YOU!"

    Western Animation 

-   _Batman: The Animated Series_:
    -   Roxy Rocket does this a lot. It's her whole purpose, actually.
    -   In a bit of a Meta\-example, Andrea Beaumont in _Batman: Mask of the Phantasm_ was named after voice director Andrea Romano due to Kevin Conroy's deliberate invoking of this trope by ending a recording of a series of grunts and moans of Batman getting beaten up, with a moan of "Oh, _Andrea!_"
-   In _Code Lyoko_, some of the grunting and other fight audio for the Lyoko Warriors, especially Yumi and Aelita, (d)evolves into this after a while.
-   _Drawn Together_: Clara and Foxxy do this in the first episode.
-   _X-Men: The Animated Series_ has Jean Grey, who is surprisingly very useless, and is often getting knocked around, leading to lots and LOTS of moaning and grunting and other strange sounds.
