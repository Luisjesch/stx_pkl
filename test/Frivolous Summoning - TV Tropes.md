**Kochin:** I have scoured the planet for you for the last fifty years. With you lies my only hope. Eternal Dragon, I beseech you! With your bountiful mystical power!... could you please melt the ice off my front door?  
**Shenron:** E-excuse me?

When someone tells you they'll be there if you need them, they generally have something specific in mind. But with somebody at your beck and call, it can be hard to resist the temptation to call them when they're not actually needed. This can be either supernatural (such as through a Summoning Ritual) or mundane (such as through a signal or phone call), and the reasons for doing it can range from laziness to pettiness to stupidity. In either case, done too much, the summoned person-turned-Beleaguered Assistant may eventually refuse to help anymore. May then become a Crying Wolf situation when a real need to summon them arises.

Often a form of Mundane Utility. Compare Inconvenient Summons, for when it happens where the summoned person is already busy, and Wasteful Wishing, which can overlap.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the original _Dragon Ball_, Commander Red of the Red Ribbon Army wants to summon the Eternal Dragon in order to make himself taller. Those working under him are not at all happy with him when this gets out, especially since his selfish desires have caused a significant fraction of them to be killed by the One-Man Army that is Goku.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   Back in the past when Lucy was little, she was given Aquarius's key and would often summon her just to have a playmate, to Aquarius's annoyance. This is the reason why she's usually so belligerent to Lucy in the present time of the story whenever she's summoned, as Aquarius held a bit of a grudge for it, despite Lucy having long grown out of her childish mentality.
    -   Lucy ends up taking a quest to help a town that needs water as their central fountain has been broken. Lucy summons Aquarius to fill in by having Aquarius stand in the middle of the broken fountain and using her urn to produce water until the town has their fountain fixed. While the town is understandably happy that they got water again, Aquarius ends up being less than pleased at being used by Lucy as a temporary replacement for a broken fountain.
    -   While Lucy has summoned Cancer on several occasions to help, one notable incident stands out as this. Lucy near the end of the Tartaros arc summons Cancer to make Wendy's short hair long again after the latter cut it earlier in the arc. While Cancer is perfectly fine doing this, it wasn't something Lucy had to do for Wendy and she could have just let Wendy grow her hair out again normally.

    Comic Books 

-   _Dungeon Monsters_: In volume 2, the sorcerer Horous and his friend Alcibiade land their flying mount at the top of a tree and they don't know how to get down, so Horous summons the gigantic demon Azdebaroth to ask him to put them on the ground. Ironically, the two are attacked by a hostile tribe shortly after and Alcibiade suggests that Horous summon the demon Azdebaroth again to help them, but Horous reveals that he can only summon him once every nineteen years.
-   _Mélusine_: The witches in this setting have a bad habit of this.
    -   An early strip has Mélusine getting frustrated by a summoning spell not working well enough, and finally calling a powerful demonic spirit by literally throwing everything she has in her cauldron... only to ask him to help finding a pair of earrings she lost.
    -   In _Inferno_, Mélusine and her aunt Adrazelle are seen summoning undead, ghosts and demons in a complex ritual sequence... to serve as pieces for a life-sized chess game.

    Fan Works

-   _The Violet Room_: Myde comes across a stand where some kids sell handmade bracelets and stuff in exchange for doing something scary.

    Films — Animation 

-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Friendship Games_: The movie opens with the girls (save Twilight) suddenly being called for an emergency. Turns out it was from Pinkie who did so at the request of Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo who wanted to see them "Pony Up"; that is, show off their magic powers when they play songs. Naturally the girls aren't amused they were pulled away from other activities for that.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Batman Forever_: Chase Meridian switches on the Bat Signal to tell Batman that Two-Face's coin is his Achilles' Heel, and having made this Captain Obvious statement, starts hitting on him. Batman realises that Chase just wanted an excuse to chat, and tells her, "You called me here for this? The Bat-Signal is not a beeper."

    Literature 

-   In the short story "Silly Young Billy Goat", a young, anthropomorphic billy goat is given a bell by his grandfather and told to ring it when he's "in danger". However, the goat doesn't know what "in danger" means, and so uses it to tell Grandpa that a fly, then a straw, has landed on him. When a wolf attacks the goat, the grandpa initially doesn't come (in a variation on Crying Wolf but without deliberate lies) but thankfully saves him just in time. The story has An Aesop about what danger really means.
-   _Children of the Nameless_: Miss Highwater is one of the most infamous succubi in existence, a skilled manipulator and seductress who has previously brought down nations by targeting the right people at the right time. Davriel summons her to be his accountant. While initially she's extremely annoyed that he's wasting her talents, it turns out that he looked over all her old demonic contracts and realized how her Exact Words and Loophole Abuse screwed over all her previous masters. She is touched that he genuinely (and correctly) thought she'd be great at dealing with his paperwork.
    
    **Miss Highwater:** I'm not ashamed of what I am or how I look. But... it's nice to be recognized for something else. A thing I've always prided myself on, but virtually every other person — mortal and demon alike — has ignored. So no, I don't think Crunchgnar is completely right. Perhaps we were all created for a specific purpose, but that doesn't prevent us from finding other purposes as well.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Last Week Tonight_: During the 8th season, there was a Running Gag about John Oliver being able to summon George Clooney whenever he wants and irritating him with pointless summons.
-   In the _Sherlock_ episode "The Sign of Three", Sherlock texts Lestrade for "help". The latter assumes the worst because of the unusual way of contacting and the messages' briefness and leaves an important crime scene in haste while also ordering "maximum backup". Apparently, Sherlock only needed some help while preparing for Watson's wedding which he didn't care to elaborate in his text to Lestrade, as when he arrives at Baker Street, this dialog ensues:
    
    **Sherlock:** Do you know any funny stories about John?  
    **Lestrade:** What?!  
    **Sherlock:** I need anecdotes. You didn't go through any trouble, did you?
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   _Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st Edition_, _Dungeon Master's Guide_: One of the possible items on a Necklace of Prayer Beads is the Bead of Summons, which allows the wearer to summon their deity. If the wearer doesn't have a good reason for summoning them, the deity will take the Necklace as the _least_ punishment for doing so.
    -   _Priest's Spell Compendium_ Volume 1. The Council of Spirits spell allows a shaman to summon an entire group of spirits to debate important issues. If the issues the spirits are asked to resolve are routine, petty, or personal in nature, the spirits may punish the shaman for wasting their time.

    Web Animation 

-   In the third episode of _AFK Arena: Just Esperia Things_, with all other options being exhausted, Niru uses a ritual to speak to Qaedam — inventor of necromancy and lord of the undead — to help with his son Daimon's math homework. Qaedam is furious at this because not only was he being called over something so silly, but he was powerless to help his own son with the exact same assignment.
-   Pretty much the whole point of _The Summoning_, which revolves around Witch Girl Claire attempting dark rituals to summon demons for notably mundane tasks. The animated short has her summon a white, jagged-faced blob creature named Scaroar for the purpose of "eliminating some scum from \[her\] life forever". This is quite literal: She wants it to clean her bathroom. To be fair, this does at least seem to be the demon's purpose.

    Webcomics 

-   In _8-Bit Theater_, this is subverted. After Drizz'l summons Lich and the two begin arguing, Lich protests that he wasn't summoned to argue semantics with an elf, and compares it to summoning a demon to get help with homework. The subversion comes in as Drizz'l actually summoned Lich to kill the other Dark Warriors and just got sidetracked.
-   _Belzebubs_:
    -   In one flashback strip, Lilith and Leviathan summoned a demon on Halloween just to ask him for candy. He is not happy, but Lilith notices his breath smells like Skittles so he reluctantly gives them some candy anyway.
        
        **Demon:** Listen, little shits. Have you idea who you're dealing with? Do I look like someone who'd come bearing sweets?  
        **Lilith:** Your breath smells like Skittles.  
        **Demon:** Fine.
        
    -   In another strip, the family is playing Scrabble and Lucyfer plays the extremely long name of a demon Sløth has never heard of, and doesn't think exists. Lucyfer summons the demon right then and there just to prove he's real.
        
        **Lucyfer:** Hearken to my tongue, o Azhragogrugroggin! Demon sultan of the unsung, show me thy horned noggin! Heed my humble plea, reveal thyself to me!  
        _\*PUFF\*_  
        **Lucyfer:** Sorry, Azh. Just trying to prove a point. Want a cookie?

-   Denied in _Things Mr. Welch Is No Longer Allowed to Do in an RPG_:

    Western Animation 

-   _Big Hero 6: The Series_: In the episode "Mayor for a Day", Richardson Mole, who won the titular position, begins to abuse the Big Hero 6 emergency helpline to summon them for autographs, playing with action figures, moving a mini-fridge, appearing on his podcast, and giving him a massage.

-   _DuckTales (2017)_: When Gizmoduck teams up with Mark Beaks to become Waddleduck, rather than acting as an actual hero, Beaks has him respond directly to Waddle user requests, leading him to be summoned for things like parallel parking a car, providing relationship counseling, and feeding Louie grapes.
