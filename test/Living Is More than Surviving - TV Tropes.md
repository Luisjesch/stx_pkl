_"I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really — get busy living, or get busy dying."_

There are situations when characters are in a dangerous situation and steps must be taken to survive, whether it is keeping safe from natural dangers, or escaping from the consequences of the follies of their civilization.

However, this can be taken too far when the result is the characters constantly living in fear or complacency without end, such as hiding from the world even when the situation has changed or there are responsibilities to recognize.

This Aesop comes when at least one character begins to realize that all their community's focus on survival is producing a life that means nothing beyond giving into their fears or sloth. Instead, the characters realize that they have to have more in their lives, something to live or work for. This puts them in conflict with the others who refuse to change and demand the dissenters fall back in line and re-enter their shell. This will climax with the heroes saying something like "No, I'm tired of surviving where the only thing waiting for us is death, I want something to live for!"

In the end, the heroes manage to convince the whole community to leave their stifling fear and enter the world with all its risks and work for something constructive and meaningful. As a result, everyone finds that they are happier and up to the challenge.

This stems back to how humans are called _Homo sapiens_ for good reason: every creature on the world, including humans, have the instinct to survive, but only humans (other sapient species in speculative fiction notwithstanding) can think beyond survival — that is, comfort, wealth, expression, and many more.

In the Pyramid of Needs by Abraham Maslow, this trope is fulfilling everything above level 2.

This, in a way, is the opposite of Ambition Is Evil: that is when trying to improve your lot in life is a bad thing, probably leaving you Lonely at the Top. This trope is when having no ambition beyond not dying early is a bad thing.

A Motivational Lie may be used to instill this in someone. As an inversion, Beware the Living or anybody who follows this creed but is Too Dumb to Live.

-   _The Wicked + The Divine:_ Inanna's personal philosophy is a variation on this. As he and the others of the pantheon have only two years at the most to live after their emergence as gods, he's decided that rather than regret the life he won't have or fear dying, he'll take the opportunity to embrace the confidence godhood has granted him and live the remainder of his life to the fullest. He chides Baphomet for trying to kill him to steal his remaining years of life by pointing out that living for a little bit longer won't mean anything if he spends his borrowed time terrified and desperate.

As it turns out, the humans, and even the robots on board, are thoroughly sick of the pampered yet utterly meaningless existence they live.

    Film — Live-Action

-   _Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior_. Papagallo offers this to Max while trying to persuade him to stay and help the settlement. He can take his vehicle and leave but would end up little different from the Marauders besieging them. Or he can stay and join a community and build a future for himself. Tragically Max is so burnt out from losing his family he refuses to take up the offer even after circumstances force him to help out anyway.
-   A recurrent point in _Slow West_. "There is more to life than survival. Jay Cavendish taught me that. I owe him my life. Ho for the west."

-   Discussed in The Penumbra Podcast:
    
    **Alessandra:** Dying's easy; you've only got to do it once. You can never stop _surviving_. You've got to get up and do it all day, every day. _That's_ what's hard.  
    **Juno:** Hard doesn't mean the same thing as worthwhile.

-   An episode of _Gargoyles_ examined this trope.
    
    **Coldstone:** You said that destroying my brother is the only way to survive. Is that all there is for us, mere survival?

    Real Life 

-   A quote attributed to Jack London illustrates this (only the first line is confirmed as being his):
    
    I would rather be ashes than dust!  
    I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot.  
    I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.  
    The function of man is to live, not to exist.  
    I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them.  
    I shall use my time.
    
    -   Others include:
        
        "The proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time."  
        "I'd rather sing one wild song and burst my heart with it, than live a thousand years watching my digestion and being afraid of the wet."
        
-   An interesting case comes from an aphorism of Friedrich Nietzsche. "To live is to suffer. To survive is to find some meaning to the suffering." While the sentence flips around the meaning of both words, making it Surviving Is More Than Living, it is very much this same notion expressed: there is more to existence than suffering, and finding something that makes it "worth it" is central to living a fullfilling life, in contrast to simply trying to minimize the pain.
-   Comes up a lot in the discussion of whether or not to continue life-support for someone who is comatose, and whose prognosis is poor. Many people don't wish to "pull the plug on" a loved one, but there's also the consideration that that person might not ever wake up from their coma, or might be brain-dead, or might wake up but be permanently and _severely_ disabled, such that they might not ever be able to enjoy life, take care of themselves, or live a normal life ever again. Not helping matters is the fact that many people don't think about these things until it's too late, and don't prepare for them or discuss it with their loved ones. Which means family relationships may be torn apart (sometimes irrevocably) when members can't agree on "what \[their loved one\] would want." (Which may or may not be what they would _actually_ have wanted. And even close family members or spouses aren't necessarily better at making these decisions than strangers would be.)
    -   It's also one of the major factors in the euthanasia debate; whether or not someone in critical condition—either doomed to die in agony or in an And I Must Scream situation, either way with any hope of a normal life lost—should be allowed a more peaceful, painless death like is done with terminal pets, especially if the patient themselves requests it.
-   This is the whole point of "co-existing with the virus" doctrine when dealing with the COVID-19 Pandemic in mid-2021 and onwards. Given on how the "Zero Covid Policy" would be realistically ineffective at best, or would result in an economic collapse at worst, they decided to shift to a policy of vaccinating people and wearing masks while maintaining semblance to everyday life in order to sustain economic balance and allow people to have some kind of normal existence after prolonged isolation.
-   This is the dilemma many people with depression and other serious mental illnesses face, believing that the best they can hope for is simply struggling for survival without actually enjoying life and staying alive out of obligation. Helping them see beyond that and create a better life for themselves is a major part of recovery.
