_"This is Shiver City. It's usually completely covered with snow and ice. It's perfect for penguins."_

Penguins are the most iconic animals from Antarctica. Since they're among the few large organisms that can survive its year-round sub-zero temperatures, they're a visual shorthand for places with cold climates in fiction, even if they're not native to said place. You won't find penguins in Alaska or Siberia for example, and please don't get us started on imaginary Arctic penguins and their polar bear friends. This association with snow and ice, as well as their generally cute and rotund physiques, may also be why they are fairly common staples in Christmas media, despite otherwise having no connection with the holiday and Santa having the same polar bear issue of living on the other side of the planet.

This is Truth in Television, but Reality Is Unrealistic. Only two species of penguins live solely in Antarctica (though a few more live on sub-Antarctic islands), and the others can be found on the coastlines of Chile and Argentina, South Africa, Oceania, or even as far north as the Galapagos Islands. However, although there are a lot of tropical species of penguins, they need to live in places with cold waters (e.g. the Humboldt Current in western South America, bringing frigid waters from Antarctica). Research indicates this being a consequence of wing-propelled birds failing to catch fish in water temperatures above 15ºC, and indeed the Arctic counterparts to penguins, auks, seldom live in warm waters either.
