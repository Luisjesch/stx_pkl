Japanese ghosts and those they possess are traditionally depicted as surrounded by floating blue flames known as _hitodama_. The victims of possession traditionally tend to keep their free will, but are plagued with fatal bad luck.

The possession part is rarely played straight in anime. People dressing as a ghost will usually tie burning candles to their heads to simulate the light. Being surrounded by ghost lights are a visual indicator of someone who is already a ghost. (Usually three, because Japanese tradition assigns humans three 'higher souls' and seven 'base souls' and the latter stay with the body after death.) Some ghosts can use this form as Ball of Light Transformation.

Sometimes, when a character is "possessed" by mortification or depression about something, they will be portrayed as squatting in a (possibly nonexistent) corner, back turned to the main cast, with a black halo and ghost lights.

Interestingly, _hitodama_ (or _kitsunebi_ or _onibi_) are created by rotting compounds of a body. Although these lights give a ghostly/comical atmosphere on TV, it's perfectly possible to witness them in real life by this explanation, and who knows what they mean then...

Subtrope to Faux Flame for "flames" that aren't actually fire. See also Spark Fairy (fairies or magical insects depicted as a point of light) and Will-o'-the-Wisp (a light that leads unwary travelers into danger). Can be considered a type of Magic Fire.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _.hack//SIGN_: A blue flame symbolically appears in the background when Bear explains to Mimiru that their enemy is not an entity that can be simply attacked but is both nowhere and everywhere.
-   _Cardcaptor Sakura_: Played for Laughs when Kero dons hitodama and a Creepy Monotone when he is particularly annoyed at Sakura - because she got to eat a delicious cake and he didn't. Then Tomoyo appears behind Sakura and reveals she got him a slice anyway.
-   _Case Closed_: In an early case, the detective boys think a house is possessed by a ghost when they see a light in the window. (It turns out to just be from a candle.)
-   _Fairy Tail: 100 Years Quest_: The Spirit Dragon Slayer Reiss can conjure hitodama flames to attack (which he refers to as souls, prompting Natsu to chew him up for using souls as weapons), as well as reap souls, making them appear as hitodama flames.
-   _Hayate the Combat Butler_: A priest only has lights around him after it is revealed that he's actually a ghost.
-   _Hell Teacher Nube_:
    -   Nube-sensei likes to introduce himself to his new class by strapping candles to his head to mimic this effect... and then swinging, Tarzan-like, into the classroom, or try to play-exorcise a doll. The irony is that Nube is such a tremendously powerful spiritualist and exorcist that he can summon the real thing at will, but will only do so when he actually needs to.
    -   Many of the Obake that Nube encounters are naturally surrounded by hitodama.
-   _Inuyasha_: Kikyo is surrounded by the blue spheres of human souls at many times to sustain her resurrected body.
-   _Joran: The Princess of Snow and Blood_: The blue flames that consume Sawa's face in her changeling form are evocative of _Hitodama_, particularly since her body is partially skeletal in this state.
-   _Junji Ito Kyoufu Manga Collection_: In "Bog of Living Spirits", ghostly flames are seen around the bog where someone may have recently died. It turns out that these are the spirits of two obsessive girls hoping that the deceased, their fellow classmate, is still alive, and waiting for him to surface again.
-   _The Kindaichi Case Files_: There was an urban legend of a woman who turned into a demon in a snowstorm who is accompanied by hitodama light. This freaks Hajime out as the cabin owner tells him he saw a hitodama earlier. It's revealed to be a fire caused by the suspect to destroy an improvised ice bridge.
-   _My Lovely Ghost Kana_:
    -   The titular Kana naturally sports several balls of flames surrounding them. They are a good indication of her mood, since there are more of them and they make little "pop" sounds when she is especially happy.
    -   Also used amusingly when Daikichi finds an old "dead" cellphone and discovers that Kana can use it to keep in touch with him. A stylized hitodama is her chat icon and takes place of the signal meter on her phone.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_: Ghost Aisaka Sayo usually _isn't_ wreathed in hitodama, but can produce them if needed.
-   _Psyren_: Mithra manifests and controls hitodama-like flames called "kagaribi" (Bonfires) as her Psi power. She can apparently use them to forsee events and communicate from afar. Coincidentally or not, her body is almost rotting and she's actually "possessed", only by an Eldritch Abomination from outer space who wants to devour the Earth to restore its youth.
-   _Ranma ½_:
    -   The ghost girl Kogane Musashi manifests ghost lights when she's trying to be scary and when she arrives/departs.
    -   Gosunkugi fakes the hitodama in the traditional way with candles tied to his head.
-   _Sgt. Frog_:
    -   The ghost girl is often accompanied by hitodama.
    -   Dororo tends to sulk in the corner with hitodama around him when his "Trauma Switch" turns on.
-   _Shaman King_ has shamans who travel with at least one spirit, who is usually in the form of a wandering ball of fire. They can also force their ghost-pals into weapons, empowering them with their spirit ally, and wreathing the weapons in the flame. In this case, the hitodama have faces, mouths, and usually part of the original spirit's clothes/hair. The stronger the connection, the more of the original spirit can be seen.
-   _To Love Ru_: Oshizu has her "pure" ghost form, with floating flames around her, the same purple tint as her ghost body. These lights are not visible while she's in her artificial body.
-   _Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun_: Hanako has two of these that constantly float around him, which are a clear indication that he's a ghost. His twin brother Tsukasa Yugi has these as well since he's also a ghost, though his are black instead of white.

    Literature 

-   _INVADERS of the ROKUJYOUMA!?_: Sanae, the ghost, has weaponized the lights floating around her.
-   _I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level_: Beyond the near-constant floating, Rosalie looks so much like a normal non-ghost girl that the main signifiers for her status as a spirit are the two blue Faux Flames constantly floating near her head.
-   _Nansō Satomi Hakkenden_: After Daisuke's father commits seppuku, Lord Satomi spots a flame next to him which briefly takes the shape of a woman and embraces him, implied to be the soul of his dead mother.
-   _Spellsinger_: Gneechees are floating flames which appear whenever Jon-Tom's spellsinging is on track and particularly powerful. They aren't the _cause_ of magic, exactly, but their presence facilitates or enhances it. They normally cannot be seen because they actively dodge away whenever you try to look at them directly. When Jon-Tom is in M'nemaxa's plane, he discovers each is actually the soul of a deceased person. Because of this spoiler, gneechees have different interests and affinities, and so Couvier Coulb must summon particular musically-inclined ones when retuning the broken duar in _Time of the Transference_.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Return of Ultraman_ has _Hitodama Kaiju_ Femigon, an alien entity made of fire that possesses women (and only women). When possessing humans, they gain pyrokinetic abilities and will transform into a rooster-like monster that feeds on fire.

    -   Late at night in the original game, you can sometimes come across Wisp, the wandering ghost. He explains that he needs your help to retrieve five spirits resembling hitodama lights, which slowly float around the town. If you bring all five spirits to him before sunrise, he'll do you a favor.
    -   Wisp returns in _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_, where he gives you a similar task. If you attempt to speak with him, he will mistake the player for a ghost, causing him to become startled and his spirit to split into five pieces — once again resembling hitodama lights — that scatter around the island. As before, Wisp will reward you for gathering all five.
-   _Blank Dream_: The living awareness of the Mirror World appears to Mishiro as a floating blue flame.

-   _EarthBound (1994)_: The Zombie Possessor inflicts hitodama as a status ailment.
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Star Resistance_: The latter half of Stage 3 is populated by the ghosts of the Shakun Star's violent past. Some of these take the form of warriors with Fog Feet who hover, use attacks similar to Sharkungo, and sometimes possess battle tanks. The rest are composed of floating, flame-like wisps who float aimlessly from one side of the screen to the other. The Hitodama Light type is especially prone to filling the screen and saturating it in single-shot bullets.
-   _Final Fantasy X_: The Pyreflies are fragments of souls who haven't been "sent". If they are not sent to the other side by a summoner, they'll turn into one of the monsters you battle.

-   _Fire Emblem Fates_: In the _Birthright_ and _Conquest_ routes, Lilith will appear on the My Castle battle map as a blue flame after her Heroic Sacrifice.

-   _Ghost Trick_: The default form for a ghost is a little blue wisp of flame.

-   _Musya_ has ghostly hitodama flames as weak enemies, who can be extinguished with a quick swish with your spear.

-   _Street Fighter EX_: Garuda is surrounded by floating flames in his intro when faced as a boss in _EX2_ (_Plus_) because he is a demon dressed in samurai-like armor. His Soukondan super technique allows him to weaponize these flames.

-   _Tomodachi Life_: The sick/sad animations in the Japanese games show the ghostly embers of possession forming next to the character instead of the Personal Raincloud seen in the US and EU versions.
-   _Touhou Project_:
    -   _Touhou Youyoumu ~ Perfect Cherry Blossom_:
        -   Youmu Konpaku has a phantom half always present and independently visible around her. There's an Asian belief that human souls actually have two parts (Kon and Paku, hence her name). There's the immortal "higher" soul (Kon) that either becomes a ghost, like Yuyuko, or enters the cycle of reincarnation, and the transient "lower" soul (Paku) that animates the body and houses the earthly passions and which could, after death, become an unintelligent evil spirit, such as those seen in _Subterranean Animism_. Youmu's phantom-half is apparently her higher soul, while her lower soul remains in her human body, giving it life.
        -   Yuyuko Saigyouji is the princess of a ghost palace (and a ghost herself), and is continuously surrounded by hitodama. She can use them as an Attack Drone in combat.
    -   _Touhou Chireiden ~ Subterranean Animism_: Rin Kaenbyou is surrounded by what appears to be small balls of flaming _skulls_ — appropriate, since her job is to carry off corpses into the underworld. In some spell cards, she is accompanied by _zombie fairies_, which look pretty similar (though a later guidebook claims that they're just normal fairies who like to dress up). The _Wild and Horned Hermit_ manga reveals the skulls are "evil spirits", which are what souls carried off by kasha turn into.
-   _World of Warcraft_: Night elf characters will turn into small glowing blue balls (with, if you zoom in close enough, a face) as they return to their body.
-   _Yodanji_: The Hitodama is a "character class" that can become available. Difficult, but Awesome to use since they're One-Hit-Point Wonder outside of a possessed body.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   When the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne is driven from Maya's body in _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_ (specifically, the third entry, "Trials and Tribulations"), it turns into nine blue flames forming the outline of a magatama before disappearing.
    -   In Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice, during trials that take place in the Kingdom of Khura'in, fitting with the spiritual nature of the kingdom, the player's number of remaining lives are represented by icons of greenish hitodama flames.
-   When appearing to Akira in the underpass, the spirit Kakuya from _Spirit Hunter: NG_ is followed by two small, flickering orbs of flame. One of the game's trailers has her on a dark street, lit only by the light of her hitodamas.

    Webcomics 

-   _Circumstances of the Revenant Braves_: The form Musashimaru takes when on the physical plane is essentially a hitodama.
