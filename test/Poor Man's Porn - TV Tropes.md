**Buffy:** _The Pagan Rites_, checked out by Alexander Harris.  
**Xander:** Alright, alright, it's not what you think.  
**Willow:** You like to look at the semi-nude engravings?  
**Xander:** I guess it _is_ what you think.

There are some things that all humans need from time to time. Apart from food, shelter and love...they need sex, or failing that, at least porn. Unfortunately, it's not always so easy to come by, even as an adult — maybe it's a more straitlaced era where pornography is uncommon or hard to come by even for the most resourceful people (or maybe you can come by it, but you can't talk about it on television!) Or maybe the urge, shall we say, has only just set in and there's no actual pornography nearby. What to do?

The obvious answer is "find something that's almost as good and work with that". After all, if it works, it works. There are three main variants of this trope.

**Educational Porn**: Thanks to National Geographic Nudity, something containing nude or scantily clad people that is intended for cultural or educational purposes can be co-opted for titillation. _National Geographic_ magazines are the most commonly cited here, for obvious reasons. Never mind that the photo subjects have no reason to adhere to Western beauty standards, resulting in floppy breasts, tribal piercings, and so on; a 13-year-old boy is not picky when the _urge_ is upon him. Similarly, workout tapes with scantily clad women, sporting events, nudist magazines and marital "how-to" guides also fall into this category, and were even sometimes slyly marketed as "legitimate porn" in the past.

A particularly extreme variant of the above is **Religious porn**: Many religions have holy texts containing at least _some_ sexual content (for example, the _Song of Songs_ in _The Bible_), as well as teachings that condemn your soul for the idea of doing what that makes you think of doing. Generally used in media to portray a character struggling under a deeply religious upbringing, or to make fun of the hypocrisy of the religious. It is also the most 'moral' of all the possible material used for this, and therefore the easiest to plausibly disguise if a character is caught doing it. Religious porn has a long history in the art world, with many a Renaissance erotic nude being nominally a handsome Israelite hero or a beautiful female saint or Adam and Eve - modern perusal of Michelangelo can feel more Educational than Religious. Due to the _guilt_ being a big part of what makes this trope funny (as well as a turn-on for many), finding it in the context of religions with more sexually positive views is far more rare, but jokes about the illustrations in the Kama Sutra are in no way uncommon.

**Advertising Porn**: Because Sex Sells, advertising is usually full of slightly erotic and suggestive images — so why not make use of that? While there's no nudity, lingerie/underwear catalogues and similar can be used for somewhat more sexual purposes than they (supposedly) were intended. And where some fetishes are concerned, it doesn't have to be the least bit risqué; someone with a foot fetish can make do with a furniture ad if the person on the couch is attractive and barefoot. In some countries with more relaxed attitudes than the Anglosphere, advertising _may_ feature nudity. This sometimes leads to the phenomenon of English-language TV shows about the weirdness of foreign advertising — which can feature healthy doses of Fanservice.

**Scrambled Porn**: Mostly seen in shows from the 80's and 90's, as newer technology has made it obsolete, a character will try to make out a pay-per-view television program—porn in this case—that has been scrambled by the cable provider because the character hasn't paid for it. Every so often they might claim to see a nipple...wait no those are her eyes. This particular variant died out in the late 90's with the rise of satellite TV and digital cable. Nowadays you'll simply get a blank screen if you turn to a channel you're not subscribed to or a pay-per-view program you haven't bought. If scrambled porn was before your time, you can get an idea of what it looked like with this Safe For Work YouTube video of scrambled Discovery Channel here: Scrambled Cable Channel. You can see how the occasional recognizable object would come into sight.

Still Truth in Television. Before the Internet rose in the 1990s - 2000s, there was a real social and physical barrier up between the average person and pornography. You actually had to go to a porn store to buy it (newstands and convenience stores only had softer stuff like _Playboy_), or get a catalog from which you could order it. Many people were worried to the point of paranoia that their job or church would get word that their car was seen in the parking lot of the seedy adult bookstore, or someone would see them buy _Playboy_ at the tobacco store. And if that's how much trouble the adults had, the teens surely had it worse — usually having to locate their parents' Porn Stash when no one was home or to be lucky enough to find it in a Dumpster Dive.

Times have changed because The Internet Is for Porn, and anybody with a connection can see as much porn as they like and whatever kind they like, making this a largely Forgotten Trope. Although Internet censorship is turning this into a Cyclic Trope. What has changed is the price. It used to be you not only had to go somewhere to get porn; but it was expensive, too. Nowadays anyone can have a collection that dwarfs (perhaps in more ways than one) their parents'/grandparents' stashes — in an evening — and all fitting on an easily-stashed USB key. However, the underage may still have trouble secretly accessing porn if their internet usage is closely monitored by a parent who is tech savvy enough to prevent the workarounds that usually foil more clueless parents, or if they don't own a computer in the first place, or if they're still on 56K dial-up or DSL.

All of the above aside, some people just have very unusual tastes. They can find everything from certain types of clothing to certain types of professions or skills to be turn-ons when most people wouldn't.

In British Media, this trope is still prevalent due to Values Dissonance and Ofcom regulations including the watershed, so not entirely discredited.

Anime & Manga

-   In Episode 13 of _Osomatsu-san_, it's revealed that Jyushimatsu gets off to a Bug Encyclopedia (yes, of _literal_ insects).

Comics

-   In _Twisted Toyfare Theatre_, one of Dr. Doom's evil plans involved intercepting the Fantastic Four's mail just so Reed Richards wouldn't be able to get off on awkward tribal totty in _National Geographic_.
-   Subverted in _FoxTrot_: Roger thinks Jason is growing up after he comes home from a garage sale with an armful of _National Geographic_s. After all, why else would a young boy want them? As it turns out, the geeky Jason and Marcus want them for the articles, in particular the Apollo 11 issue.
-   There was an article in _MAD_, where one of the captions showed a kid jerking off to _National Geographic_. All we see of the magazine is the cover: "TRIBAL WOMEN".
-   Hobbes once mentions checking out the hot tigress babes on the _National Geographic_ covers. (Of course, Fridge Logic sets in because, really, aren't tigers _always_ naked? Maybe the tigresses in question had been _shaved_...)
-   The animals in _Liberty Meadows_ were once seen getting excited about a nature documentary, on the mating habits of African Wild Dogs.
-   Marvel Comics had a two-issue crossover between Wolverine and the Punisher — whose artists apparently have a rivalry of some sort: the Punisher issue had the Punisher make a fool of Wolverine by subjecting him to morbidly over-the-top physical injuries, and finishing up by keeping him indisposed by parking a steamroller on top of him. The Wolverine writers got even in round 2 by having Wolverine trash the Punisher's van, and finding an enormous collection of, ahem, "men's weightlifting magazines" in the front seat.
    
    **Punisher:** It's an investigation! Those men are all suspects!
    
    **Wolverine:** Sure. Right. Whatever you say.
    
    -   Likely a reference to the film _Murder by Death_ in which San Francisco-based detective Sam Diamond is questioned by his secretary about all the bodybuilder magazines he keeps at his office. "They was all suspects!"

Film

-   In _The Strawberry Statement_ movie: "Do you remember that... _National Geographic_ you have in your back room? Yeah, well this one is a white version of page 43."
-   In _Kick-Ass_, the protagonist is initially a nerd who is ignored by the female populace of the school and, in his own words, 'easily excitable', so _National Geographic_ is, as shown, enough for his tastes then.
-   In _Porky's_ one of the character is seen to use _National Geographic_ to "kick start" his member for his daily measuring routine...
-   In _Bernie_, the prosecutor observes that Bernie subscribes to a men's fitness magazine without being very athletic himself.
    -   Historically, fitness and sport publications have been a source for beefcake porn for men in homophobic cultures.
-   _976-EVIL_: Early in the film Hoax can be seen reading from a _National Geographic_ magazine for this use, but his religious mother catches him red-handed.
-   In _Colonel Kill Motherfuckers_, Nicholas masturbates to pictures of pottery in _National Geographic_. And pictures of gorillas.

Literature

-   Implied in Mark Twain's _Tom Sawyer_ when the eponymous character finds his girlfriend peeking into technical literature on anatomy belonging to the teacher, which was notable as this kind of literature was outlawed _exactly because of this trope_ (well, as the book is set in a mid-19th century Missouri village, it is completely justified).
-   In David Klass's _You Dont Know Me_, John appears to be using the _National Geographic_ for this purpose (when he actually just happened to flip to that page). His mother just shrugs it off and says that it's normal, but her boyfriend is considerably less understanding.
-   In the _Red Dwarf_ novel _Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers_ Rimmer calls out his double on their habit of being aroused by pictures of Renaissance paintings.
-   The Morris Gleitzman book _The Other Facts Of Life_ references this trope at the beginning. Ben's mother finds a _National Geographic_ magazine, complete with a barebreasted tribeswoman picture, in his bedroom, and insists that his father talk to him about sex, since such a magazine in a 12-year-old's bedroom "can only mean one thing". It turns out that Ben is puzzled by her insistence that it must be sexual, as he has been preoccupied with the idea of third world hunger.
-   In _Colin The Librarian: The Chronicles of Ancient Threa - Volume 3 or Maybe 4_ by Rich Parsons, Colin sees the main perk of working at the library being access to _National Geographic_.
-   Discworld
    -   Mentioned in _Wyrd Sisters_ which clarifies that witches do _not_ perform rituals naked and that detail was included because many books about witchcraft are written by wizards, who are men who don't get out much.
    -   That same joke returns in _Good Omens_ with the character of Anathema Device, who is noted to be wearing practical clothing as opposed to this trope.
    -   When the wizards are exploring the Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography's study in _The Last Continent_, a couple of them become very interested in some of the books with illustrations of islanders who "exist in a state of Nature within their own skin".

Live-Action TV

-   _M\*A\*S\*H_ mentions this one a few times - Radar talks about how his Uncle Ed used to punish him for looking at the nude tribeswomen in _National Geographic_. Most of Hawkeye's mail for the first few seasons consists of different nudist magazines.
    -   When Hawkeye and Trapper are leaving for R&R in Tokyo, Henry tells them to stop at a bookshop where he's ordered some old Japanese prints under an assumed name. ("Some things never change, if you get my drift.")
-   Referenced in _Frasier_: Frasier talks about sharing a room with Niles and being kept up all night by the latter's looking at _National Geographic_s under the bedcovers. When Niles asserts he was only looking at the maps, Frasier replies that this is what made it so weird.
-   An episode of _Married... with Children_ had the librarian trying to seduce Bud by getting him hot. When he studied in the library, she'd recommend books with the sexiest nudes and mark the pages as what he should study. Predictably, he's caught masturbating and nearly gets expelled for it.
-   One episode of _Friends_ mentions this: Joey is giggling at a _National Geographic_ magazine, and Chandler asks him if he's looking at the naked tribeswomen. As it turns out, he's looking at a pig.
-   _Chappelle's Show_ presented a Parody Commercial for _Third World Girls Gone Wild_; the video was a documentary film of topless tribeswomen performing a presumably traditional dance.
    -   In a similar vein, _Saturday Night Live_ had a Parody Commercial (here) for a homemade DVD featuring The Shake Weight that guys can watch as if it were porn (the Shake Weight is real, but it's probably not intended to titillate in that fashion).
-   In the "DNA" episode of _Red Dwarf_, after Kryten gets turned into a Human, he finds that a triple-deluxe vacuum cleaner in an appliance catalogue gives him a double Polaroid.
-   _Oz_:
    -   Referenced in a season five episode of, when Ryan O'Reily is talking about Hawaii in the drug rehabilitation group, explaining that he read about the well-endowed women in "National Pornographic", with the impressive full-colour photographs.
    -   The inmates' favourite program is the children's TV show "Miss Sally's Schoolyard", because Miss Sally has large breasts.
-   In one episode of _Bottom_, Richie and Eddie get into an argument about whether the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel is pornography. Attempting to prove it is, Eddie pulls out their art history book with a picture of the ceiling in it - and finds it falls open to the exact page:
    
    **Richie**: How dare you accuse me of masturbating!
    
    **Eddie**: Who said anything about masturbating?
    
    **Richie**: You did, just then!
    
    **Eddie**: I did not, I just said it's odd how it always falls open at that precise page!
    
    **Richie**: Yes, you did, and the reason you said that is because you know that's the picture I always look at when I'm having a w—\[stops himself a second too late\]
    
-   An episode of _Black Books_ features an audio version of this, with a subplot basically involving Fran masturbating while listening to the Shipping Forecast because she finds the voice of the man who was delivering it that evening irresistibly arousing.
-   In an early _Buffy_ episode, it's revealed that Xander regularly checks out rare occult books on witches "to look at the semi-nude engravings".
-   _The Doctor Blake Mysteries_: In "Death of a Travelling Salesman", the presence of a large stack of bodybuilding magazines is taken as evidence that the victim was homosexual. (The show is set in the 1950s and bodybuilding magazines were the closest thing to gay porn available.)
-   _Mad Men_: Ken tells a story about, when he was a teenager, going to see an "educational" movie about sex that was obviously thinly-veiled porn. He saw one of his teachers there, but it set up a situation of "mutually-assured destruction"; neither of them could get the other in trouble for going to the movie without exposing that they were there, too.
-   Variation in _That '70s Show_. Instead of National Geographic Nudity, Jackie gives Kelso a copy of Cosmo magazine so that he can get in touch with his feminine side and relate to her better. She notes that she removed the reproductive health related material so that he wouldn't get distracted by it. At the end of the episode, Kelso has found an uncensored copy of the issue, and the boys are huddled around him. What they're looking at is implied to not even be nudity, but a diagram of the reproductive system that they confuse for a map of Six Flags, which makes it even stranger that they're clearly getting off on it.

Music

-   The refrain of "The Bad Touch" by the Bloodhound Gang mentions acting out the animal mating scenes in nature programs that originally aired on the Discovery Channel (and since moved to sister channel Animal Planet).
-   "The Real Slim Shady" by Eminem quotes a line from "The Bad Touch" implying that said nature programs can be used for this purpose.

Radio

-   A Running Gag in _Round the Horne_ was Kenneth Horne's collection of magazines about the benefits of a naturist lifestyle, which he read for the articles.

Tabletop Games

-   An article on setting _GURPS Dungeon Fantasy_ games on the Discworld suggests that part of the popularity of the older Monster Compendiums published by the Order of Subterranean Taxonomy is that, after a few days underground, delvers become very interested in the sketches of succubi and sylphs. Any similarity to 80s teenagers and the first edition _Dungeons & Dragons Monster Manual_ is entirely coincidental.

Video Games

-   Possible example: Dr. Langford in _BioShock_ mentions that the paganistic Splicers holed up in Arcadia have been breaking into her lab and stealing, among other things, her _National Geographic_ collection and muses with disgust, "They're feathering their disgusting shrines with it, I suppose, the sick bastards."
-   In _Deltarune_, NPC classmate and part-time librarian Berdly mentions an overdue book entitled _How to Draw Dragons_, and describes the cover as featuring a mauve dragoness wearing lipstick and "... well, \[Kris will\] know it when \[they\] see it." Kris' own description notes that the dragoness on the cover is dressed "immodestly" and that their brother Asriel is likely not going to return it. It later crops up in Chapter 2 as one of Noelle's <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  interactions with a Poppup<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .

Webcomics

-   Taken to the extremes in _Joe vs. Elan School_. Amongst all the other ways being kept at the titular Boarding School of Horrors damaged his psyche, Joe mentions in an aside that being a hormonal teenager cooped up in a place where every expression of sexuality were strictly forbidden and would be met with punishment, including merely looking at someone of the opposite sex in the "wrong" way, made him rather desperate for any kind of way to release the tension. He remember that he frequently would flip through the math textbooks he was handed, to see if there were any female stock-photo models in them and if they had any kind of exposed skin, noting that even the sight of a female ankle would be enough to make him feel hot and bothered.

Web Original

-   The Channel Awesome group review had The Nostalgia Critic getting off to George Takei's biography.
-   From _Cracked_'s The 5 Most Unexpected Things About Life at Guantanamo Bay: "This isn't to say that no one wanted that magazine for its own merits. Once a guy asked, 'Hey, in National Geographic I hear they have ... boobs, yes?'"
-   _SCP Foundation_: SCP 1839 is a textbook called "The Reproductive Methods of Bony Fish" that makes the reader think they're a fish. The article for it acknowledges that the book could be used for sexual purposes (though this is discouraged), if the reader was a fish like yourself.

_While its content may list several sexual techniques, please don't use this book for personal pleasure._

\- Dr. U. R. A. Fish

Western Animation

-   In an episode of _American Dad!_, Stan shows Steve an anti-masturbation film to keep him from touching himself. In the video, a young boy is home alone and can't decide what to do. He finds a copy of National Geographic with the headline "Women of the Bush" and walks into the bathroom with it, so it's quite clear what he's doing in there.
-   In the episode of _Beavis And Butthead_ where the titular duo become magazine telemarketers, during their interview, Butthead asks if they'll be selling adult magazines. Beavis gives the example of _National Geographic_.
-   _Bob's Burgers_: In "Carpe Museum", Zeke spends his time on a field trip to the local natural history museum showing Gene all the exhibits that have boobs in them.

Other

-   Robin Williams - in _Live On Broadway_ he asserts this was the case for him.
-   Dave Barry also referenced the phenomenon.
-   Russell Baker asserts this is the reason why knowledge of geography is on the decline - back in the day, _National Geographic_ was all they had, so some real knowledge was picked up on the way.
-   According to Encyclopedia Dramatica, Wikipedia is filling this void in the modern era - after all, someone who walks in suddenly is less likely to be bothered by you looking up something on Wikipedia than by seeing a porn website. However, since Wikipedia is not censored, it still contains a fair amount of NSFW material that can do the job. Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger has written an essay accusing Wikipedia of having a "porn problem".
    -   Wikimedia Commons is even worse/better, depending on your view. The Other Wiki has roughly five images per article, Commons is _nothing_ but images.
    -   Several jurisdictions reportedly prohibited unsupervised access to Wikipedia for minors at schools just for that reason.
    -   Cracked had something to say about this with its 6 Most Terrifying Sex Illustrations on Wikipedia (Mostly work safe).
-   For anyone with surfing behind a filter, DeviantArt may also fit the bill. Why else would the "artistic nude" pieces get so much attention?
-   Comedian Tony Martin - in his book _A Nest of Occasionals_ he recounts the time that he and his step brother found some of the same _National Geographic_s in the school library their parents had bought for them and, upon comparing them, were horrified to find that for several years their mum had been removing the pages which had any pictures of naked tribal women on them.
-   Sex ed pamphlets and some anatomy books can have moderately explicit images. In some books, the diagrams of various human systems are superimposed on a photorealistic image or even actual photograph of a naked woman.
    -   Teenage boys often noted that in sex ed textbooks a picture of a man's sex organs are fully rendered and detailed, while a woman's are usually rendered with a diagram of the uterus and fallopian tubes, often in cross-section. If a drawing of a vagina from the outside was shown, the labia (the "lips") were almost never shown spread apart to see the parts. This has changed, and any teenager with an internet connection can see a picture of an open vagina on Wikipedia.
    -   Along the lines of trying to avert this trope, the instructions of how to apply a tampon are often the most simple line drawings possible. Yes, teenage boys have checked in the instructions from the box in the bathroom.
-   _National Geographic_ themselves acknowledged this trope in their 1988 centennial issue.
-   In the 1970's, a sub-genre of pornographic films popped up known as "White Coaters". In the legal battles regarding the obscenity charges laid against _I Am Curious (Yellow)_, the Supreme Court ruled that a film cannot be obscene if it has educational merit. White Coaters tried to exploit this by having the film be introduced by an actor in a white coat claiming to be a doctor or scientist, explaining that what you're about to see is absolutely meant for anthropological and educational use and nothing else.
-   Ever wonder why there are so many fitness videos released before the 1980's? It's not because people want to be fit.
-   Parodied in _Touhou_ fanart: Rinnosuke finally realizes why Wriggle Nightbug was so interested in a field guide to insects.
-   Reportedly, 24-hour sports channels that focus on gymnastics are very popular in Turkey, because erotic channels are banned.
-   Singer Bob Geldof, in the book of the TV series _Geldof In Africa_, refers to childhood memories of how Africa was portrayed to him as a youngster... including the fact that the National Geographic gave him the first pictures of naked women amongst its inhabitants—despite the otherwise strictly Catholic educational establishment he was attending, they let it fly because the _National Geographic_ was _educational!_.
-   Most of the men's exercise magazines including _Beach Adonis_, _Face and Physique_, _Muscle Boy_, _Men's Workout_ and _Exercise for Men Only_ are popular with gay men for this very reason.
-   _ESPN the Magazine's_ annual "Body Issue" features various professional athletes doing artistic nude photos. While the actual photos are tastefully done—genitals and women's nipples are always covered by props or limbs, and their poses relate to their sport rather than being sexually alluring—the fact remains that the photo subjects are pro athletes of both sexes and a diverse array of races and body types, all at their physical prime, baring it all for the camera. It's hard _not_ to...appreciate the artistry at hand.
-   _Sports Illustrated's_ Swimsuit Issue _started out_ the same way, back when the magazine was a little less rigorous on what defined "sports content" to begin with, having an issue on tropical getaways to exotic locations in the Caribbean in the middle of February seemed perfectly logical. Even as recently as the mid-90's, the Swimsuit issue still doubled as a regular issue of SI with the usual articles about sports.

    Advertising Porn 

Comedy

-   Ben Stiller's character uses lingerie ads during the infamous "hair gel" scene in _There's Something About Mary_.
-   The titular character in _Meeting Daddy_ is a strict Baptist who disapproves of premarital sex, so he makes his daughter and the man she is engaged to sleep in separate rooms when the man comes to visit the family home in Georgia. The man becomes seriously sex-starved and starts fantasizing about all the things that turn him on; he mentions at one point to his fiancée that he's always had a fetish for old-fashioned bullet bras, and used to masturbate to pictures of women wearing them. As it happens, the fiancee's mother used to wear a bullet bra, and the girl slips it on under her blouse in the hopes that her boyfriend will notice. He does.
-   In _Adaptation._ Charlie Kaufman beats it to the picture of Susan Orlean on the back panel of her book _The Orchid Thief_.

-   In _Time Changer_, the protagonist (a Christian fundamentalist theology professor visiting from the 1800s) complains to a clothing store manager that a mannequin dressed in lingerie will "arouse impurity" among the customers. He is surprised when the manager replies that Nobody Ever Complained Before. (We don't actually see the offending display, but the store looks a lot more like Sears than Victoria's Secret.)

Literature

-   In the _Laura Caxton_ series, Laura uses this as "The Reason You Suck" Speech: the vampire who's trying to kill her used to be, and psychologically still is, "a sad little man who used to jack off to the bra ads in the newspaper".
-   In the business directory section of the _Discworld_ spin-off _The Complete Ankh-Morpork City Guide_, there's a listing for a corsetry maker that mentions the full catalogue is available discreetly and contains "hundreds of GIRLS in corsets". Apparently, they've worked out where the primary market is.

-   _Seinfeld_: In the infamous "Contest" episode, George drops something off at his parents' house when no one is home. Sitting down to wait for them, he spies one of his mother's copies of _Glamour_ and, needing a way to kill time, decides to go to town. His mother promptly comes home and catches him in the act, which shocks her so badly she collapses and injures herself. As a result, George swears off masturbating for good, thus inspiring the creation of the titular contest.

-   In _Peep Show_, the best thing Jeremy can find for masturbation is a gaming magazine with a rather conservative picture of a "sexy hobbit" on the cover, around which he tries to construct an elaborate fantasy.
-   In one episode of _The Wire_, Landsman (who usually openly looks at much more dirty magazines at work) is seen perusing a Victoria's Secret catalogue. When asked why he made the change, he remarked, "Change of pace. They look pretty hot with their clothes on, too."
-   In one episode of _The Inbetweeners_, Jay masturbates in an old people's home over the problem pages in women's magazines (which he describes as "wanking gold"). Later, when he's been through them all (even having to wank over Fern Britton), he finds a black and white photograph of a woman in a bikini. Hilarity Ensues.
-   _Bottom_ again: Richie repeatedly demonstrates a willingness to masturbate to anything with a picture of a woman in her underwear in it.

Newspaper Comics

-   Similar to the _Calvin and Hobbes_ example above, there's a _Get Fuzzy_ where Satchel quickly snags a magazine when the mail arrives and runs out of the room. Bucky comments, "_Field and Stream_: the Victoria's Secret Catalog for dogs." The outdoors = lots of trees = lots of places for dogs to relieve themselves?

Western Animation

-   _The Simpsons_: In part 2 of "Who Shot Mr. Burns?", Moe is forced to admit under a lie detector test that he's going home to "ogle the women in the Victoria's Secret catalogue". When this is flagged as yet another lie, he admits it's actually the Sears catalogue.
-   In one _Family Guy_, when Stewie finally succeeds in derailing Peter and Lois' plans to conceive a fourth child (about twenty seconds after he stops trying), Peter takes a lingerie catalogue into the bathroom.
-   In the _South Park_ episode "Cartman Sucks", Butters is taken to a religious camp for bi-curious boys with the intention of removing their non-heterosexual tendencies. In one scene Butters' roommate is scolded by a counselor for having a men's underwear catalog from the 1980's hidden in his dorm room.
-   In the _Gravity Falls_ episode "Scary-oke", Dipper sneaks into his Grunkle Stan's bedroom, and ends up finding a trunk full of women's fashion magazines. Dipper is rather put-off ("Euw! Pretending I never saw that..."), perhaps guessing the most-likely reason his crusty old great-uncle has back-issues of "Lady Swimwear" and "Fully-Clothed Women Magazine".
-   _The Family That Dwelt Apart_: As the narration relates that the only thing the Pruitts ever went to the mainland for was the mail, one of the younger Pruitts is looking at the Sears catalogue. Mainly, the brassiere section.
-   _Mission Hill_:
    -   In "Porno For Pyro", Kevin's repression and anxiety when it comes to regular porn causes an incident that leads to the school bullies being put on trial for attempted murder, and when the whole thing is cleared up during the ending, he vows to stick to lingergie catalogues from then on.
    -   In the script for the unproduced "Supertool", it turns out that Andy's advertising firm invokes this trope using subliminal messaging; taking advantage of America's puritanical and repressive culture by inserting subtle sexual imagery in their ads, leading to a case of stealth-Sex Sells. And we do mean _stealth_, something as simple as mascot for a brand of canned pasta can invoke the response.

Other

-   Department store catalogs are the epitome of this, particularly any containing listings for swimwear, underwear and lingerie. And we're not just talking catalogs from recent decades either; flip through the old Sears catalogs from the early 1900s and some of the females drawn wearing underskirts and modesty garments were kinda cute...
-   Interestingly, one of the ways you could buy porn pre-Internet was by ordering a free catalog from a distributor. This presented an interesting twist as sometimes _the catalog itself turned into Poor Man's Porn_. The reason many of these catalogs were censored or pictures printed really tiny was not because of censorship laws, but they wanted people with the catalog to _actually order something_, not just use the catalog.
-   Something similar to the above exists with internet porn as well. Porn sites often walk a tightrope of providing just enough preview content—text descriptions, photos, and brief videos—to entice viewers into buying/subscribing, but not so much that they can just masturbate to the previews.
-   Brian Posehn mentions that a young boy can get off on anything, up to and including pictures of bras without women in them.
-   Chris Rock wrote in his book _Rock This!_ about his mother finding and disposing of his pornography collection when he was a kid. Needing a substitute, the best he could come up with was a box of Aunt Jemima pancake mix. He starts to fantasize about her being younger and more attractive...only for Uncle Ben jump from a box of rice and yell at him for trying to seduce his woman.
-   Real Life - during Operation Desert Storm, soldiers were forbidden to possess pictures of scantily clad or nude women (after all, they are operating in the Middle East where standards for modesty are very high), so made do with more fully-clothed and covered models instead.
-   Many religious "kick-the-porn-habit" self-help books mention being turned on by lingerie ads. These books also have to walk a fine line because self-help books usually tell stories so readers know they are not alone... but those stories can also be used for "poor man's erotic fiction", or "suggestions for poor man's porn".
-   The January 1992 _Mensa Bulletin_ cover became controversial due to its "pornographic" nature, with readers even writing in accusing the magazine of feeding their pornography addictions. The model was wearing a fairly modest negligee. Some Mensans later made fun of the discussion by complaining that one of the following covers, which was of flowers, was offensive because the flowers on the cover had their sexual organs showing.
-   In one column, Dave Barry talks about taking the Land o' Lakes "Butter Maiden"—the Native American woman (formerly) on the front of a package of Land o' Lakes butter—cutting out the box of butter she's holding in front of her chest, folding it so that her knees show in the window, and drawing crude nipples on the kneecaps so that it looks like her tunic is open and showing her breasts. At one point, the company cropped the image into a close-up of her face to stop teen boys from turning her into an exhibitionist, before removing her altogether (probably for being a Braids, Beads and Buckskins stereotype rather than this trope).
    -   An episode of _The Simpsons_ had a scene where Bart demonstrates the trick to Lisa, which gives her the idea to pretend she has Native American heritage for a class project.
-   Many straight women and gay men like to look at the Abercrombie & Fitch catalog because of the naked guys in them.
-   Most gay and bisexual men will admit to at one point having kept the packaging their underwear came in for this exact reason. In fact some will insist that the hot underwear models were an early Closet Key for them. Underwear companies that cater to gay men, like Andrew Christian, tend to be utterly shameless in invoking this trope, having online commercials that are basically "Watch these half-naked muscular guys have fun in our underwear!" For bonus points, some companies (including Andrew Christian) will feature actual gay porn stars in their ads.
-   Similar to the above underwear entry, long-form infomercials for exercise equipment can serve as porn for people attracted to men. Most feature at least one extremely muscular shirtless male model demonstrating the machine's capabilities, which usually involves a full-body workout that leaves them pumped up and sweaty. Lean and muscular women occasionally feature in the ads as well, so Amazon Chasers can also enjoy them. The Shake Weight was particularly infamous for this, to the point that even Ellen Degeneres was joking about it on her talk show even though her comedy is usually raunch-free:
    
    **Ellen:** (Using the Shake Weight) I don't know what this is preparing me for but I hope I never find out...
    

    Scrambled Porn 

Film

-   _American Pie_: In the opening sequence, Jim is caught by his parents trying to watch scrambled porn.
    -   Later, Oz mentions that "if there's a channel that should be illegal it's the 'all-woman's channel lifetime supply of pantyhose or some shit." and Jim, that "Ariel, man. She's so hot!".
-   Parodied in _Not Another Teen Movie_ during the opening sequence when Janey is watching "She's All That". While not completely scrambled, it does look grainy and wavy.
    -   Watch in Spanish here.

Live-Action TV

-   _The Drew Carey Show_ has an episode where Drew, Oswald, and Lewis try to to watch scrambled porn because Drew believes that the cable company will turn him in if he has both Cartoon Network and porn channels.
    -   It turns out it's the surgery channel they're watching, not the porn channel.
-   Al and Bud try this in an episode of _Married... with Children_, turns out it was an elbow.
    -   When NO MAAM goes to Washington DC, the first thing Al does is have Ike unscramble the porn channel.
-   In the VH1 series _I Love The 80's_, scrambled porn was mentioned:
    
    "Masturbation by itself won't make you go blind, but masturbating to scrambled porn just might."
    
-   _The Goldbergs_ had this with Adam and Barry discovering a scrambled porn channel, and it becomes something of a bonding experience until they try to find a way to "fix" it...

Web Original

-   Referenced in _Gaijin Smash_.
-   _Homestar Runner_: Though the primary point seems to be the violence rather than the porn, in the Strong Bad Email "rated" Strong Bad, Coach Z, and Bubs watch an R-rated movie on scrambled cable. One line in the "movie" is a sexy-sounding female voice saying "Two underwears", implying that the porn is there nonetheless.

Western Animation

-   One episode of _The Simpsons_ reveals Moe is too cheap to unscramble the porn channel at his bar. It turned out to be an advertisement for shoe inserts.
    
    **Moe:** I've been writing creepy letters to _that_?
    
    -   One of the comics had Moe describe some superstitions, and he started claiming that a lucky shirt of his would help him get _real_ lucky...before confessing that he'd end up at home watching scrambled porn. No confirmation whether it was the ad or not.
    -   Another episode had the Springfield police at a college checking out surveillance on the CCTV, but when they decide to check out the coed's dorm room activity, needless to say it's scrambled.
-   Not surprisingly, _Robot Chicken_ takes a stab at it. Watch here.

Real Life

-   Older television sets had a focus knob which the especially persistent masturbator could turn to bring more focus to the scramble — you never got a perfect picture, but could see more than a regular scramble.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Unfortunately this required _constant_ attention to keep up with the constantly changing screen — and usually using your dominant hand, too.
    -   It was also possible in some cases to get a clearer picture by turning the channel-change dial halfway between the designated channel and the next one up.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Like the focus knob, this required attention, and like the focus knob, the channel dial went the way of the dodo eventually.
-   Moviebob references this in his review of _Heavy Metal_. He points out that the reason this movie was such a big deal was, back then, "boobs were really hard to see". Before the internet, if young men wanted access to nudity, they either had to steal Playboys from the least responsible male authority figure in their lives or use "tin foil and pie plates to unscramble Cinemax for a couple of seconds".
-   Technology eventually marched on, and beginning in the very late 1980's, cable-ready televisions and VCR's (meaning they could be directly wired to receive cable tv rather than needing a separate box) had a chip that recognized the scrambled signal and replaced it with a solid blue screen. Not really a blue screen of death, but it certainly dashed hopes here and there. Also, some TV sets actually offered a way to _turn off_ the feature buried deep in the settings screen for those who truly need it — it's just that no one ever reads the manual to find out about it.
-   However, it's not quite a Discredited Trope in the United Kingdom, given the controversy surrounding opt-in filters for "adult" material.

    (Sac)religious Porn 

Comics

-   The cartoon book "Heiterkeit braucht keine Worte" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  has a Danish cartoon about why the (fictional in-universe) Illustrated Bible was a bad idea.
    
    **Two spoiled children:** "Show me the scene with Potiphar's wife again!"
    
-   A _Playboy_ cartoon depicts a colonial-era Puritan reading the Bible to his children, one of whom requests "the part where Abimelech looks out the window and sees Isaac 'sporting' with Rebecca."
-   Gore Vidal told of an old Hollywood screenwriter he knew (The Wise Old Hack) who referred to Biblical/Classical epics as "Teats and Sand" movies.

Film

-   _A Clockwork Orange_: Alex is forced to take Bible classes as part of his rehabilitation. He mostly focuses on the passages describing bloody battles and royal concubines to imagine himself in either situation.

Literature

-   The first description of the female orgasm in literature was written by the 9th-century nun and polymath Hildegard of Bingen, in a description of the religious rapture she experiences with a recurring fantasy of an angel with a beautiful face who penetrates her through the heart with a flaming spear. Needless to say, there was little else available in a convent.
-   The Song of Solomon from _The Bible_ is basically erotica.
-   The Talmud suggests that seeing women's clothing—on a clothesline—is erotic.

Live-Action TV

-   Richie in _Bottom_ masturbates to the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel regularly enough that his art book falls open on that page.
-   On an episode of _M\*A\*S\*H_, Father Mulcahy finds that a patient has an interest in reading the Bible, only to find out from what part he's reading that it's the _Song of Solomon_. At that, Mulcahy politely advises he reads something in the Bible that is less... "inspirational."

Tabletop Games

-   _Exalted_ has Regent Fokuf, the Puppet King of the Realm, spending his private time jacking off to the holy texts of the Immaculate Order. It's basically the equivalent of reading The Bible and indulging one's self to the Song of Solomon.

Video Games

-   The Vestal's origin comic in _Darkest Dungeon_ shows her getting excited by religious murals in her convent, before being chastised and recoiling in shame.
-   In the _Dragon Age_ franchise, the leader of the setting's dominant religion (basically their version of the Pope) is the always-female Divine. The late Divine Rosamund was elected at 19 and was noted for her beauty, and as a result she was the subject of a great deal of unauthorized art and literature.

Anime & Manga

-   In _Dragon Ball Z_, Master Roshi has been shown drooling over women's aerobics programs on television...in spite of the fact that it's been shown several times over that he owns pornographic magazines.
    -   Referenced in an episode of _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_ where Roshi is in the middle of leering at an aerobics program when Oolong points out that he can get ACTUAL pornography from the Internet. Roshi says that being able to enjoy things like this is what separates the connoisseurs from the mere perverts.
-   Roshi's example has been faithfully followed by a whole generation of Dirty Old Man mentors, chief among them Happosai of _Ranma ½_.

Comics

-   In _Soulsearchers and Company_ #3, one of the videos in Baraka's Porn Stash is an aerobics tape.
-   In a _Big Nate_ strip, Nate tries to teach Spitsy to attack cats by showing him Ellen's cat calendar. Spitsy immediately runs off with it and starts drooling over it like Nate's showed him porn.

Fan Works

-   _The Bolt Chronicles_: Canines seemingly consider the magazine _Dog Fancy_ to be suitably titillating. Referenced in "The Cameo" and "The Seven."
-   _This Bites!_: After the SBS gets a visual component, Zoro's shirtless workout routine quickly becomes its most popular programming among female viewers. Cross is _very_ annoyed by this, not least of all because he has to keep blacklisting female viewers who call in with inappropriate comments about.

Film

-   _Born American_ (1986). One of the protagonists in the gulag gets hold of a coin and tries to purchase medical care for his friend. The Friend in the Black Market says it's not enough, but as the protagonist is a young man he could use it to buy... _(puts a finger through hole in coin and leers)_ We then cut to several male inmates, including the protagonist, looking through vents into the women's shower. Contrary to the usual Girls Behind Bars trope, the women are rather unshapely.
-   At the very beginning of _Clockwise_, headmaster Brian Stimpson apprehends (over a loudspeaker) a group of boys who are looking at some pictures. They then drop the pictures, briefly revealing they are of naked women.
-   In _Grandma's Boy (2006)_, Alex uses a Lara Croft action figure as visual stimulation while staying over at his friend's house due to not having access to anything better.
-   In _Good Boys_, Max uses a video game's Character Customization menu for this before his dad interrupts. From the looks of it, he's into the game's Amazonian Beauties. He and his friends later discover real porn, though, and are disgusted by it.
-   _Pitch (2009)_: Jim masturbated over the football team in his high school yearbook, having lusted after them in secret.

Literature

-   A Deleted Scene from _Life, the Universe and Everything_ (later included as an extra in special editions and added, in abridged form, to the radio adaptation of _And Another Thing..._) revealed that the Galactic Government has incredibly strict anti-pornography laws, passed — perhaps surprisingly — by President Beeblebrox, which happen to go into explicit detail about all the things that aren't allowed to be portrayed in any way. This means of course, that they are the _only_ portrayal of such acts available, and may be accessed for a small fee. Nobody knows for certain where the money goes, but it's obviously Zaphod Beeblebrox.
-   The _Discworld Post Office Diary_, in its list of prohibited items, says that the Post Office will deliver saucy, and even naughty postcards, but not rude ones. It adds that anyone unclear on the difference may, for a small fee, peruse examples of all three categories in the Post Office archives.

Live-Action TV

-   _Bottom_:
    -   _Bottom_ has a running gag about Richie and occasionally Eddie masturbating to the news when read by newsreader Sue Carpenter. At one point, Eddie gives Richie a 'play telescope' for Christmas, which is a toilet roll tube with a crude drawing of Sue Carpenter in a bikini on the beach taped over one end.
    -   In one episode, Richie and Eddie get off on 'pornographic doodles' of the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and "Meryl Streep" that Eddie has been printing on his forged banknotes. Later, when they hand a "£27" note to the bartender, he finds himself overcome with the need to run off to the bathroom...
-   Exaggerated in _Extras_ when a guy is Caught With His Pants Down with a novelty pen that had a picture of a pinup girl on the side.
-   In an early episode of _Fresh Off the Boat_ Eddie tries to pass off a “sexual harrasment in the workplace” training video meant for his dads employees as porn to his class mates. It works, a bit too well actually and it soon starts to spread amongst the middle school populace.
-   _Gen V_: In "Jumanji" the main group find themselves trapped within Cate Dunlap's mind. A mental image of Soldier Boy shows up, bragging about how Cate, who was kept imprisoned in her room by her parents, learned to masturbate with a Soldier Boy pillow, and still does.
-   _GLOW (2017)_: Sam Sylvia's pitch to the network for GLOW is "porn you can watch with your kids".
-   _Peep Show_ features an episode where Jez decides to make some money by donating his sperm. Because the clinic has not provided him with any porn to get him in the mood, he's forced to improvise with the only thing he has on him — a five pound note with a picture of a young Queen Elizabeth II on it ...

Music

-   In the music video to "Anxiety" the boy in the evil dentist's waiting room reads the "True Police Yearbook". Headline: "So Sex Hungry - She Killed For It!"
-   "Weird Al" Yankovic: The video for "Amish Paradise" has a shot of an Amish porn magazine, in which a woman shows off her ankle.

Western Animation

-   _American Dad!_: Roger's nude portrait of Haley that Steve had been masturbating with (it was a neck-down portrait, so he didn't know it was his sister) is sold at auction. Steve resigns to going back to "squinting really hard until stuff looks like boobs".
-   One episode of _The Critic_ has lovelorn Jay Sherman fantasizing about _The Statue of Liberty_ who he imagines seducing him and taking off her robe for him. He's quickly stopped by a police officer who points out to him a sign that forbids him from doing just that.
-   _Rick and Morty_
    -   In _The Ricks Must be Crazy_, Rick and Morty are stuck three levels deep in recursive universes. This universe is relatively new, so it doesn't have any technology, and therefore, no porn. While Rick takes several weeks trying to find a way to escape back into their own universe, the teenaged Morty grows increasingly sexually frustrated, before he finally snaps and angrily demands that Rick hurries up in finding a solution, telling him the situation has taken such a toll on him that he recently masturbated to "a curvy piece of drift wood."
    -   Several episodes imply the ever-pathetic Jerry does this sort of thing a lot, with his family being utterly repulsed by it and not even _remotely_ believing his excuses, like the Victoria's Secret he had stashed under a mattress or a _mannequin leg_ he keeps hidden which poor Morty and Summer stumbled upon once.
-   _The Simpsons_: In the episode "Bart vs. Australia", when the man in Antarctica tries to check which way his toilet flushes, he discovers that the water in the bowl is frozen. Another man walks into the bathroom with a swimsuit magazine and is disappointed to see.

Real Life

-   A common complaint of public and academic library staff is patrons using the art and photography collection for masturbation, sometimes right in the library.
-   Women's magazines such as _Cosmopolitan_, _Glamour_ and the like are theoretically not supposed to be wank fodder for teenage boys raiding their mom's stash, but in reality, they feature almost as many scantily-clad women as the likes of _Maxim_, so there you go.
-   Olympic events featuring attractive female athletes are notorious as this. Running jokes such as "well-rounded athletes" and being appreciated only by "men of culture" are mandatory.
-   Television shows and movies featuring exceptionally attractive actresses sometimes serve this purpose too. Shows like _Married... with Children_ and _Charlie's Angels_ had Ms. Fanservice characters as some of their primary appeal.
-   This trope is a criticism of some cosplayers, particularly female ones who upload pictures of themselves in their costumes. The No True Scotsman fallacy can be used to attack them as "fake geek girls" who aren't really interested in geek culture but are just trying to make money off horny nerds. This is further complicated because _actual_ sex workers do cosplays more and more frequently to appeal to parts of their fanbase (as well as the reverse situation where cosplayers start doing adult work), either for a payday or because they genuinely are One of Us, blurring the line between "normal" hobbyist cosplayer, "mainstream" Fanservice Model, and outright porn star.
