**Al:** Don't worry, it won't cost much... cause I'm gonna build it myself!  
**Bud:** Mom, I'm scared.

It's an idea that you see often in sitcoms: whenever a plumber/exterminator/repairman/whatever is needed for something around the house, the father (usually, but not always, a Bumbling Dad) almost _always_ says something along the lines of, "You don't need to call a professional; I'll take care of it." Often, he enlists the help of one of his sons (never a daughter), then the attempt to economize backfires horribly.

Can result in a D.I.Y. Disaster, where a mechanical device's functions are switched around. For strictly plumbing-related projects, see Do-It-Yourself Plumbing Project. Compare and contrast Duct Tape for Everything.

    Advertising 

-   An ad for a French building supply store has an enthusiastic amateur drill a hole in the wall, then blow on it to get the dust out. It somehow _blows the dust back in his face_, to which his wife rolls her eyes and heaves an exasperated sigh.
-   Seen on a repairman's truck: "We repair what your husband fixed".
-   One of the Dumb Ways to Die is "Do your own electrical work." From the same vid, we get the guy who tried to teach himself how to fly. It ends as well as you expect.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Inuyasha_, the title character accidentally damages the handlebar to Kagome's new bicycle. While she goes to school, he volunteers to fix it. Given his lack of knowledge on bicycles — or anything else from the modern era for that matter — things quickly get out of hand, and by the time Kagome gets home, the bike is in even worse shape.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Calvin and Hobbes_: Calvin occasionally tries to fix things around the house (including more than one ill-fated plumbing incident), and usually ends up causing more destruction than when he tries to destroy things.
    
    -   When Calvin's dad is trying to fix his bike, Calvin says this:
    
    **Calvin:** Why bother? On the rare occasions when you know what the problem is, you usually make it worse and hurt yourself in the process!  
    
-   _Crabgrass_: In this comic, after his mom refuses to buy Miles a pair of shoes that light up when you walk, his dad offers to make some. Knowing how this is going to end, Miles begs his dad not to, but to no avail. Indeed, the resulting shoes are outright ridiculous, much to the amusement of Kevin.
-   Roger makes a habit of this in _FoxTrot_. In his best effort, he manages to burn his silhouette onto the wall while trying to light the furnace. It's even been invoked on at least one occasion; Jason convinced him to make his own homemade wine (to predictably disastrous results) as a way to get back at Andy after she'd banned him from playing _Diablo II_.
-   _Garfield_: Jons attempts to repair things around the house have a great chance of turning into this, like in the title panel of this comic.

    Eastern Animation 

-   _Pat and Mat_ have it as their entire shtick.

    Fan Works 

-   This is the reason for the horrible broken-down state of the _All Guardsmen Party_'s ship, the Occurence Border. The ship was carelessly treated by previous owners (a series of dumb or impressively unlucky Rogue Traders), and so not only is it half the length it should be (The prow fell off. Multiple times), the myriad failures in equipment have resulted in kludges kludged on top of other kludges, so absolutely _nothing_ works as it's supposed to, and only the sticky notes put on everything by the resident engineers will give you any good directions (sometimes, at least). The ship is also very warp-tainted, and the most common fix for _that_ is just to wall off the affected area. Tech-priests consider it an abomination in the eyes of the Omnissiah.
-   Implied in _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_:
    
    **MTM:** And yet, this isn't half as dangerous as the time your Dad tried to fix the toaster.
    
-   A Noodle Incident in the _Kill la Kill AU_ fanfic, _Breaking and Entering_, mentions something like this happening to Ragyo. She tried to fix a microwave and got a screwdriver in her hand for her trouble.
-   Hits Twilight hard in the _Triptych Continuum_: while kicking a patron out, she puts a crack in the library door — a crack which she decides she _must_ fix herself. It doesn't exactly proceed as planned.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _The Crazy Family_, The father hits an ant nest and water main after digging a new basement.
-   The basic plot of the Buster Keaton film, _One Week_. The newlyweds try to build a house with a full kit, but a rival sabotages the parts numbering. Obviously, professional house builders could have spotted the problem long before the couple does.
-   The Three Stooges are pretty much the kings of this trope. One short has them building a dream house for their wives, which ends up being something out of a Picasso painting with a set of stairs leading to nowhere and a door on its side.

    Jokes 

-   One customer in a computer repair shop overhears the clerk, instead of repairing the faulty computer, claims it's just a minor glitch and give the owner a moderately-long list of instructions on how he can repair it himself. After the owner happily goes away, the customer asks "Hey, does your boss approve of you losing money by telling people how to fix their equipment themselves?" "Sure", says the clerk, "they spend here a lot more, so that we'd repair things they fixed".

    Literature 

-   A mild version in _Adrian Mole_, when the teenage Adrian takes it upon himself to paint his bedroom with a colour he likes (black), deciding that at his age he can no longer live with Noddy wallpaper, and the other Toyland idiots running round the walls. He does the job without stripping the paper, and uses a half-inch brush. Predictably, the job takes a very long time, and things keep showing through the paint, even after several coats, especially "Noddy's bloody hat bells". He resorts to using black felt tip pen to erase them when his paint runs out. The end result of this project is that the room looks dark and gloomy, and dog will no longer stay there, whimpering to be let out.
-   Bree Pym decides to repaint her bedroom early in _Aunt Dimity and the Lost Prince_. Unfortunately, she does so during a February cold snap and cannot open the windows for ventilation without risking freezing and/or bursting the plumbing pipes. This brings her to Lori's doorstep in hopes of a place to stay for a few days.
-   Jack Prelutsky takes this to comically exaggerated heights in his poem "I Wish My Father Wouldn't Fix Things Anymore." (note: PDF link) Everything the father in question fixes works after a fashion, but not in quite the intended way—for instance, a toaster that previously didn't pop now pops even when disconnected.
-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire_, what Harrenhal probably needs to get fixed up properly is a major cash injection, mass evacuation, a good six or more decades of constant scaffolding and an army of masons, carpenters, blacksmiths, plasters, plumbers and all their suppliers. Failing that: ten years and a wrecking crew would do to start back at scratch. What it generally gets is... bodge jobs on a budget that never address any of its core issues because no lord it has had since Harren the Black built it can afford to anything else.
-   Older Than Radio: Jerome K. Jerome's _Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)_ features a brilliant story about Uncle Podger hanging a painting along these lines.
-   In Diane Duane's _A Wizard Alone_, Senior wizard Carl provides an instance of this when Kit stops by and finds him trying to rewire the lights in the kitchen, despite his housemate's repeated suggestion that he call an electrician:
    
    "We're expert enough to change the laws of physics temporarily," Carl muttered. "How hard can wiring be?"
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   The entire point behind _Canada's Worst Handyman_, a Spin-Off of a similar series for driving. Five handymen are taken to a building in need of renovation with the person that nominated them. They are given a series of challenges, ranging from making a worktable to installing a ceiling fan to installing disco balls. The show also includes several challenges where all five handymen are brought together to do a larger project. The end of each episode includes ‘Most Improved’ who leads the next group challenge and ‘The Worst’ who is given ‘homework’ to do with the host. At the end of a season, the host and two experts decide that season’s worst.
-   In one episode of _Coach_, Luther and Dauber try to install a new floor in Hayden's rec room (After their first, off-camera attempt resulted in a floor that was decidedly not level). They lose control of the cement mixer and in the final scene of the episode are part of the new floor, as the cement has risen above their ankles and hardened.
-   Community: Pierce tries to fix the outlet in Annie's apartment as she moves out.
-   _Doctor Who_: The Doctor, in all his incarnations, has a pathological dislike of manuals of any description or for any item. Being the Mr. Fixit of the universe, this should actually make you worry a bit, as it can blow up spectacularly in his face. And, everybody else's. Still... he does manage to gaffer-tape up the worst of any mess you stick him near in imaginative and often innovative ways. Even if he caused the mess in the first place.
-   _Emergency!_: In the aptly-named episode "Breakdown", the paramedic truck breaks down and the paramedics try to fix it themselves, much to the annoyance of the regular mechanic who doesn't appreciate them doing his job. Sure enough, the problem keeps coming back, and even forces them to abort a run. The mechanic eventually solves the problem and the Station Captain bluntly tells the paramedics to leave future mechanical problems to him.
-   Frank Barone in _Everybody Loves Raymond_ fancies himself as an ace repairman and handyman. As he is retired, his good intentions are focused on his son Ray and daughter-in-law Debra, who live just over the street. Frank's doom-it-himself blunders include alienating the whole street by using power tools at seven on a Sunday morning; destroying Debra's bathroom with a bodged repair on the shower; destroying both Marie's and then Debra's stoves with bodged kitchen repairs; painting Ray's house the wrong colour; and causing the stairs to collapse at Ray and Debra's.
-   Carl on _Family Matters_ was infamous for being absolutely _terrible_ with housework, yet determined to be a man and fix it himself to save a few bucks. A Noodle Incident involving a spice rack ended up with the family staying in a hotel for a week while professionals fixed the mess, just to give you an idea. He tried to install a shower for his mother and somehow ended up crossing the pipes so turning on the sink turned the shower off. _That's_ how bad he is. He also almost burned the house down trying to fix a toaster, and his birdhouse was condemned by the Audubon Society. Perhaps more poignantly, he also electrocuted himself trying to fix a lamp and would have died if Steve Urkel hadn't performed CPR to save his life.
-   _Fargo_: Played for Drama when Lester, a spiteful Henpecked Husband, tries and fails to repair the washing machine himself. His wife belittles him for it, the argument escalates, and he murders her.
    
    **Pearl:** You killed my washing machine!  
    **Lester:** _\[stammers\]_ ...I was being a man.  
    **Pearl:** But you're not a man, Lester. You're not even half a man.
    
-   In the _Fawlty Towers_ episode 'Gourmet Night' Basil insists on fixing the car himself despite Sybil's orders, resulting (of course) in the car being unfit for use when he most needs it. Also the methods of the cowboy builder O'Reilly in 'The Builders', whose slogan is "no job too cheap".
-   _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_: Judge Philip Banks was a highly respected attorney, and becoming a judge only improved his reputation. Unfortunately, he crossed into full Bumbling Dad mode whenever he tried to fix something around the house. His attempt at fixing the stove burned off his butler Geoffrey's eyebrows, his attempt at fixing the toaster caused Geoffrey to get hit in the eye with a piece of toast, his attempt at fixing the phone killed the line, and his attempt at fixing the sink caused a major leak.
-   On _Grand Designs_, clients who try to save on money by being their own project managers inevitably end up causing delays and cost overruns due to their inexperience. Kevin McCloud always advocates for the hiring of proper professionals because the upfront costs are almost always cheaper than having to fix mistakes.
-   _Hannah Montana_: When Jackson learned how much plumbers usually charge for their work, he convinced his Dad to hire him for a smaller (but still big enough to convince Jackson) amount. Jackson's Dad was furious at the results and called a professional plumber. Surprisingly, the plumber concluded Jackson actually prevented something _worse_ from happening and said Jackson could be a professional plumber.
-   Practically the whole shtick of _Home Improvement_'s Tim Taylor, who would (of course) apply Tim Taylor Technology. (Except of course when it _did_ work. This usually occurred when he stopped _assuming_ he was doing it right and did things like double-check measurements and read the manual.)
-   _Its All Relative_ did this in one of its few episodes: the son-in-law to be breaks his fiancée's gay dads' fancy cappuccino machine, and _his_ father tries (and fails) to fix it.
-   _Married... with Children_'s Al Bundy also espouses a Doom It Yourself philosophy. His family stays out of it, but sometimes he gets his NO MA'AM buddies to help him, who are all just as incompetent as he is.
    -   One time, all the NO MA'AM members' wives started a betting pool on which husband would fall off the roof next, and on what.
    -   In one episode he claims he is inspired by his grandfather (who apparently had the nickname "Grandpa Hook" because of this).
    -   In one episode, after countless attempts to fix the roof (making it worse in the process and falling off several times) he actually succeeds in fixing it _and_ the TV antenna. Sadly, he can't avert this Trope, as the episode ends with him hanging upside-down from the roof by wires, yelling for help.
-   The cast of _MythBusters_ often does this on purpose, disabling safety features on the items they test in order to see how catastrophically they can fail. For example, in several myths involving water heaters, Adam and Jamie blocked off the safety valve so that the heater would explode once enough pressure built up.
-   _Our Miss Brooks_: In "Do It Yourself", Mr. Conklin starts the plot in motion when he burns down his garage after a misguided attempt at fixing the electrical wiring.
-   The guys on _Pawn Stars_ are frequently offered classic cars, which can sell for huge prices. Unfortunately, some of these cars' owners did their own mechanical work, and it turns out they were so incompetent that they actually _weakened_ their cars' performances and resale values. As a result, Rick Harrison and his crew frequently have to turn the car owners down, because it'll cost more to get the cars working properly than they'll be able to sell them for.
    -   Also common with antique metal objects, especially guns. People find them and decide to clean them up with steel wool, destroying all value from the object.
-   Invoked on _Red Dwarf_. Lister cuts Kryten in twain to rescue him from a crashed ship, then rebuilds him and seems to have a _lot_ of wiring and a printed wiring board the size of a colour copier's engine board left over, but just asserts that that's just what happens when you try a bit of do-it-yourself. Until it is quickly shown that part of that board's functions were to allow Kryten to control whether he walked backwards or forwards...
-   _The Red Green Show_ got a lot of mileage out of this trope. "If it ain't broke...you're not tryin'."
-   The DIY Network's _Renovation Realities_.
    -   And inverted on fellow DIY show _Disaster House_. The point of that show is to take a house already scheduled for demolition and _intentionally_ inflict all manner of calamities upon it until such time as they do something so bad to the house that the insurance company calls the whole building a write-off, at which point they tear it down as originally planned and start again with another house. After the anvil has been rolled down the staircase, the car has been driven through the garage at speed, the herd of sheep has finished their pooping session, the elephant has finished clogging the toilet, the indoor lucha libre match or roller derby has concluded, the sand castle has been blown apart with C4, or the piano has been dropped through the roof, then and only then do they get around to undoing what their chaos has wrought. Discussions of what insurance will cover and pleas to leave things to the professionals due to the sheer scale of the disaster in question are common. (The thing that finally did in the first house, by the way: simulating ice and snow buildup with a garbage truck. Placed on the roof.)
-   _So Awkward_: In "Science Chic", Jas accidentally wrecks the shelves in Mrs Rennison's office, and Mr Salford is roped into repairing them. Jas mistakenly thinks her dad is a DIY expert - he is actually hopeless but has never had the heart to tell Jas.
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: "Genesis" begins with the _Enterprise_ testing some new weapon upgrades in an asteroid field. Worf decides to add a few improvements of his own, which results in one of the test torpedoes veering off course, forcing them to retrieve it with a shuttle.
-   Frank in _Step by Step_ closely follows the Tim Taylor model of home handyman studies; at one point he assembled a gas barbecue and had a few bits left over. They turned out to be parts of the regulator system which prevented the device from being launched across town trailing a huge fireball. He found that part out the hard way.
-   Endlessly on _Top Gear_ — the presenters have tried to build their own electric car, space shuttle<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and "Mitsubishi Evo" (nee Renault Avantime), generally for less than the cost of the real thing.
    -   The _Ground Force_ crossover for Sports Relief involved applying this trope to _somebody else's property._ The only part that wasn't Played for Laughs was the reaction shot from Sir Steve Redgrave, the _very_ burly Olympian who owned the place, who was _not_ pleased (and had the presenters genuinely fearing that he'd punch one of them).

    Music 

-   Bernard Cribbins' "Right Said Fred" is a farce about three removal men trying to shift an unidentified piece of furniture and making increasingly drastic bodges until Fred ends up knocking a ceiling down on top of his head.
-   Parodied in "Power Tools" by Ray Stevens. The narrator finds himself wanting to fix things up, but Hilarity Ensues. When he ends up in the hospital, he ends up obsessing over his power bed... and then getting stuck in it.
-   "When Father Papered the Parlour", which debuted in 1910, begins in the approved manner with Father announcing that it would be wasteful to pay professionals when he can do the job himself, and continues on with several verses' worth of disaster, including the mysterious disappearance of the piano, and a glue catastrophe that results in one of the daughters having to be hurriedly married off to her boyfriend because they've become literally inseperable.

    Podcast 

-   _Well There's Your Problem_ covers these for their Patreon-only bonus episodes, instead of the public works projects covered by their main episodes. The tone of these episodes tend to be significantly lighter than the regular ones, since DIY projects usually don't come with two-digit bodycounts or perpetuate systemic injustice.

    Radio 

-   The poet Pam Ayres wrote a poem about DIY going very wrong, with a repeated caustic line which her father often used: "You might as well have left the job alone". The poem ends as follows:
    
    What we should have done - I knew it!  
    Was get someone in to do it.  
    We might as well have left the job alone.
    
-   Fibber of _Fibber McGee and Molly_ often gets into projects of this type.
-   One of Denis Norden's monologues on _My Word!_ describes him repairing the light in the fridge himself, after he sees what the electrician is charging. He's adamant that this was a success; the light now works. The boiling ice cubes are just an unfortunate side-effect.
-   Many episodes of _The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show_ use this trope, from coloring Julius' hair with fabric dye, fixing the dishwasher with disastrous results, to buying a live steer to save money on steak (which it doesn't).

    Video Game 

-   _Hidden City_: Zigzagged in one side quest where Alford Stone wants to assemble a protective charm to guard his store from robbers. With the players help, he successfully builds the charm, but he didn't realize that the device emits a horrible screeching noise which lasts for hours when triggered. He ends up getting fined for disrupting the City and is ordered to disassemble the whole thing, leaving him worse off than he was before.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

    Western Animation 

-   _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_: The 'Mazing Man story in "Four Star Spectacular!" revolves around 'Mazing Man repeatedly demolishing and rebuilding a fireplace in an attempt to rescue a cat, with predictable results.
-   _Bat Pat_: Martin, the oldest of the 3 Silver Kids, may be smart, but he is terrible at building stuff (unlike his younger brother Leo, who is a Gadgeteer Genius).
-   BoJack Horseman attempted to fix up his family's old vacation home in Michigan. Suffice to say, his neighbor eventually bails him out.
-   _Classic Disney Shorts_: The Goofy short "Home-Made Home" has Goofy bumbling his way through putting together a pre-fab house. Despite struggling with such hazards as sheet glass and a rogue paint sprayer, he somehow manages to finish the house, but the exterior is garishly-decorated in clashing designs. Not to mention the place ends up falling apart thanks to the guests at Goofy's housewarming party getting a little too rowdy.
-   _Code Lyoko_: Sissi's Bumbling Dad Jean-Pierre Delmas boasts to be skilled with small electronic devices... but when he tries repairing his daughter's cellphone, he ends up impaling it with a screwdriver. (It does spare Sissi from being controlled by XANA's next attack through cell phones, though.)
-   _Dexter's Laboratory_: "A Dad Cartoon" revolves around Dad spending a Saturday washing the family car. His attempts at doing so causes increasing damages to the car, with Dad saying he'll "clean it now, fix it later", until he finally loses his temper, throws all the damaged parts back into the car, and pushes it over a cliff. The ending reveals that the entire ravine is filled with cars that have suffered similar fates.
    -   Mom specifically refuses to let him indulge in this trope when the house wiring acts up, calling a professional electrician instead.
    -   Another episode shows Dad's idea of gardening, which mostly involves obsessively pruning any plant life in the garden down to the bedrock. Dee-Dee gives some of Dexter's plant growth formula to the plants just to give them a fighting chance, which ends up mutating them into plant monsters.
-   _Dogstar_: In "The Quick and the Dog", Zeke attempts to fix the food synthesizer. It results in him and Alice being drenched in dog food.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_: Dad's attempts at fixing household appliances often doesn't end well. For example, "Invasion of the Dads" makes it a Running Gag that his attempts to fix _anything_ (such as a wobbly leg on a desk) result in a giant rush of water flooding the house, even when logically impossible.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   In "Peter's Daughter", Stewie convinces Brian to help him restore an old house, which they can then sell for a profit. Since neither of them have any idea of what they're doing, they just end up wrecking the house even more, to the point that the second floor _collapses_ at one point. They end up blowing up the house to get their money back through the insurance, only to remember too late they had an electrician working in there that day.
    -   In another episode, Peter breaks open the front of the house trying to put in four extra front doors, allegedly part of a house restoration tv show, but actually caused by OCD compulsions.
-   _The Looney Tunes Show_: "The Shelf" begins with Bugs Bunny refusing to pay the hardware store $20 to install a shelf, insisting he can do it himself. By the end of the episode, he has demolished his house.
-   In the _The Loud House_ episode "Home Spun", Lincoln cites this as one of the reasons the Loud family's house is in such a bad state.
-   Subverted when the _Robot Chicken_ sketch America's Most Tragic Home Videos shows a clip of a man attempting to fix a lawn mower himself and ends when his daughter announces she's pregnant.
-   _Rugrats_: In "The Pirate Light", Grandpa Lou keeps a list of all the times Stu's injured himself doing home repairs. According to Lou, Stu somehow managed to get "nine stitches and a case of pinkeye" from changing a refrigerator light-bulb.
-   _The Simpsons_. Homer is a frequent offender, with most of his DIY work falling asunder in short order. Of note is the time he tried to build a barbecue pit and instead, he wound up creating a jumbled mess that ends up getting mistaken for a modern art sculpture.
    
    **Nelson:** (After Bart wipes out on a bike Homer tried to put together himself) Ha-ha! Your dad's not handy!
    
    -   In "Hurricane Neddy", all of Springfield comes together to help rebuild the Flanders house after it's destroyed in a hurricane, only to predictably end up with an unlivable hovel that collapses right after the grand tour is done, since none of them have any sort of construction experience on top of their usual incompetence and stupidity. This ends up being the straw that breaks the camels back, causing Ned to erupt into a massive "The Reason You Suck" Speech for the whole town, the end result of bottling up all his negative emotions since childhood.
    -   _Treehouse Of Horror V_: In a parody of _A Sound of Thunder_, Homer gets his hand stuck in the toaster (_twice!_), smashing it to pieces in a panic to get loose, and when he tries fixing it afterwards, he somehow managed to turn it into a functional time machine! On a related note, Homers idea of "the right tools" to fix it involves using a rock to break open the casing.
-   One episode of _Sitting Ducks_ had the main duck try to install a satellite TV dish by himself. Not only does Hilarity Ensue, but his antics make the news, where the anchorman (Er, duck) refers to him as a 'hapless do-it-yourselfer'.
-   _Star Trek: Lower Decks_: In "Veritas", Rutherford does some tinkering to the Red Alert speakers in the repair bay where he and the other ensigns usually hang out. His goal was to make them extra-loud, but instead they stopped working entirely, causing the four of them to all be late at their stations when the next emergency comes along. The funny thing is, Rutherford _is_ a professional engineer, the person one would call to do this kind of work. But he's also a junior officer, not quite the miracle worker engineers like Scotty or O'Brien are.
-   _Taz-Mania_: The entire plot of "Home Despair" as Taz attempts to repair a hole in the wall before his parents get home. Hugh even notes that the writers couldn't think of anything else for the episode.
-   Hanna-Barbera character _Wally Gator_ also fell victim of this trope. Long story short: by the time he started believing a plumber would be needed, the zookeeper told him to call the coast guard instead.
-   _The Woody Woodpecker Show_:
    -   Charlie Beary, from a segment of the show, always tries (and fails) to do difficult chores by himself to save money, such as working on the pipes when his wife would rather call a plumber.
    -   Andy Panda's father tried to tar his roof to save the money he'd have to spend if he hired a professional. Seeing the results would make Mrs. Beary glad she's not Mrs. Panda.

    Real Life 

-   It's not just dads who fall victim to this trope. Virtually everyone having to "make do" with a damaged implement in an emergency (or from lack of funds) can coax it to work with a little jury-rigging or Percussive Maintenance, which makes the user think the problem is really fixed and continue using it without a proper repair. The latter is often what _really_ destroys the implement in the end by aggravating the initial defect.
-   A Dave Barry column deals with the columnist's attempts to do this with his plumbing system. Highlights include "a spider the size of Mike Tyson" and Barry's assertion that the Roman Empire collapsed when they tried to install plumbing in it.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Dave Barry also has a Doom It Yourself _book_ called _The Taming of the Screw_.
-   Firearms enthusiasts have their own name for this; they will often describe a poorly or hideously modified gun as the work of "Bubba Gunsmith", or say that the gun has been "Bubba'd".
-   If the dad in question is one of those "doesn't read the manual" types, this can very well turn into Truth in Television. Even if he gets it right, it almost always takes such an unexpected amount of time and money that it'd be easier to just hire a pro in the first place.
-   The site There I Fixed It is built from this trope.
-   College kids in dorm rooms also fall victim to this trope, especially when it's something the school's maintenance team doesn't repair. A little bit of duct-tape, some creative thinking, and....voila! Instantly fixed. Also an instant fire-hazard, but the joy of triumph overshadows anything else. At least for the next three days, until it breaks... again. And catches fire this time.
-   In an IRL example, there's a common misconception that the notorious Red and Yellow Lights Of Death (or "RROD" and "YLOD") on the Xbox 360 and PS3 (respectively) can be fixed by blasting the graphics chips on the systems with hot air from a heat gun, and many tutorials exist on YouTube demonstrating how to "repair" your game console in this manner. The fact of the matter is that this is at best only a temporary fix, and in most instances it actually causes irreparable damage to the GPU's heat sensors and the system motherboard, to the point where even a professional may be unable to repair the system. Long story short: you should not be trying to repair a fried game console.
-   With the release of Xbox One, a number of gullible users fell for an Internet hoax that gave a list of easy-to-follow instructions on how to make the console backwards compatible with Xbox 360. If you followed the instructions, you ended up putting the console into an infinite reboot loop that made it unusable.
-   Upgrading a PC is _usually_ simple enough to avert this trope, at least on the hardware side of things, but British gaming magazine _PC Format_ once received the following letter (paraphrased from memory):
    
    _Dear PC Format, I was in the middle of installing some more RAM when my flatmate walked up behind me and touched me on the shoulder. Suddenly_ the screen went blank _and my PC has refused to boot up since. He'd been walking barefoot on the nylon carpet and might have picked up a static charge. Does he owe me for a new motherboard?  
    Yours, etc._
    
    -   The correspondent received No Sympathy from the editors. In short, he was trying to install RAM while the system _was still turned on._
-   The website Dark Roasted Blend is _chock full_ of this kind of stuff. Most of it is hilariously nightmarish — the "Crazy Wiring" section will have you either rolling with laughter or cowering in terror.
-   The infamous "Groverhaus," a 2006 attempt by SomethingAwful moderator Grover and his wife to expand their house entirely by themselves. While Grover had previously worked as a contractor, he was not experienced enough to take on a project this big, and the end result was a Frankensteinian mishmash of disparate ideas crudely built together with supplies bought from Lowe's and Home Depot. Among other things, the front entry was crammed into the edge of one of two staggered garages, the stairs were given unnecessary insulation and had an odd, purposelessly shallow cranny built right next to them, and the whole building was held up by a single support wall placed in the middle. The house was so poorly built that it failed to meet building code certifications— leading Grover to acquire a certification license just so he could approve the house himself. The DIY project became infamous among the SomethingAwful userbase for just how poorly executed the whole affair was, with the state of the Groverhaus becoming the subject of memes on the site; Grover eventually shut down the thread that detailed the construction process as a result.
-   When Bitcoin became popular, people began to make computers specifically to "mine" them, resulting in frankensteinian "mining rigs." Sadly, people have been permanently injured or even killed in "mining accidents".
