Oh. Hey.

_"We was fucking. He killed them while we was fucking!"_

Alice and Bob are in Bob's bed having a... sexual interlude. In bursts a messenger — let's call her Carol — who has some important news to tell Bob. Instead of getting mad or awkwardly excusing himself so he can go take care of this new business in another room, Bob decides this development will _not_ interrupt his activity. Instead, he remains in bed, completely naked and sometimes doing what he was doing until then, talking with the messenger as if he were sitting, fully-clothed, in his office. Alice's reaction varies; it can be anything from a freaking out over their modesty, active, cheek-burning shame to boredom, impatience or disinterest. Note that it is almost always the male character who is doing something else, and the female character who reacts to this behavior.

It is important to note that the people who are likely to engage in Coitus Uninterruptus are villainous characters, or those who are of ambiguous "morality", typically to disrespect and/or deliberately offend the viewing character. A heroic character would usually be expected to feel some amount of anger or embarrassment upon being interrupted in this way, and would attempt to protect the modesty of his partner, whom he presumably would not want to subject to the associates' or strangers' gawking. Since perversion is a common trait among villains (as a way of marking them as unsuitable partners), Coitus Uninterruptus is a good way to show that a bad guy is particularly nasty. Villains who are extremely nasty may not even bother to _stop_ the sex act once Carol has burst in through the door, instead continuing to bump and grind away while listening to the message and/or giving orders. Disgust may register on Alice or Carol's face, but neither of them will dare speak a word of protest, since it's obvious such a villain has very little empathy for other people, and might even be in the habit of killing underlings for the slightest infractions.

One less common form of Coitus Uninterruptus is to have an Alice and Bob engage in sex while in the presence of other people, who might watch or simply go about their business, taking no notice. If the idea of it is that someone is watching or because the characters have no other option, though, that would be Sex in a Shared Room. Again, it's usually villains or the morally ambiguous characters who have a tendency for this sort of behavior — at least in _non-pornographic_ movies — although heroic types who are labeled as "sexually adventurous" might engage in it as well (they'll be less inclined to allow young children to witness it, though). In more recent works, protagonists may engage in Coitus Uninterruptus in order to show their coolness, aloofness, or just plain general superiority to other characters (i.e. "common" people). Or conceivably it could even be used in a stressful or dangerous situation, as an extremely eccentric version of Stiff Upper Lip. Like the villains, they are putting down the lesser characters by showing no respect for their sensibilities while making a general territorial statement.

Related to Make-Out Kids, which is a PG-rated version of this trope. A Sexposition scene may involve this. Contrast with Come Back to Bed, Honey (when a character tries to lure their partner back to bed), Unfocused During Intimacy (a character is distracted in the _middle_ of sex) and Post-Coital Collapse (a scene starts with two characters having just finished having sex).

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Anne Freaks_, while no one walks in on the couple, answering the telephone during intercourse seems nothing extraordinary.
-   In _Berserk_, one of the Black Dog Knights brings his master Wyald an order from the King of Midland while he's having sex with one of a harem of naked women. Wyald is merely annoyed as he keeps going and tells the messenger he’s busy. However his interest is raised by the news that Griffith has escaped from prison. As he finishes he throttles the woman until she falls to the floor unconscious (or possibly dead), and stands up completely naked as his face is revealed to the reader. It’s the appropriate Establishing Character Moment for The Hedonist and a Serial Rapist.
-   _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_: Zigzagged between Heavy Metal and Athena during the _"MILF of Steel"_ epilogue story.
    -   It begins with Heavy Metal raping Athena as he gloats about how he defeated her 20 years ago, and how he and the rest of her enemies took turns with her, before finally gang raping her all at once. Then has the audacity to ask if her daughter, Clara, might be his child since he knows Athena gave birth to her sometime after the incident.
    -   Athena doesn't bother to stop him from banging her. Instead, she looks him in the eye and tell him he's wrong. She explains she had already slept with her husband and was pregnant with _his_ child, before Heavy Metal and his men got to her. Then while he's still inside her, Athena tightens her legs around his waist and uses her immense strength to crush his spine.
    -   _"Honey, Hold Me Tightly!"_ is a 3-part epilogue doujinshi that concludes with Clara giving her virginity to her girlfriend, Mei. Which happens during their battle with Phantom Spectre, who was insulted because they were so busy having sex, that they forgot Spectre was _even there_.
-   _The Familiar of Zero_:
    -   This, combined with Not What It Looks Like, happens in the second episode of the second season. Early that morning, Agnes, one of the knights of the realm, barges into Louise's room to report that Princess Henrietta (a close Childhood Friend of Louise's) has been kidnapped. The camera pans down to reveal... Louise, shirt half-open, breathing heavily, and gripping a riding crop. Saito is shirtless, unconscious, and covered in scratches and bruises.
    -   This trope is averted three times in one episode, twice by Saito and Henrietta, once by Louise and Agnes.
-   Nakago from _Fushigi Yuugi_ experienced both sides of this phenomenon, once as the villain being interrupted (by an underling who burst in on him while he was undergoing a healing sex treatment) and once as the messenger, delivering news to the perverted Kutou emperor, who was engaged with a pair of creepily laughing concubines at the time.
-   The ORGA children from the anime _Gilgamesh_ break into the bedroom of the series' Psycho for Hire with the intention of asking him a few plot-pertinent questions only to find him _in flagrante delicto_. He's thoughtful enough to answer their questions (although whilst being unashamedly naked for the first few exchanges).
-   _Golgo 13_ has occasionally had informants walk in on him while he was screwing a random woman, all the while his expression doesn't change one bit.
    -   On one occasion, police officers arrested him while he was having sex. When he stood up, he didn't... how shall we put this... "lay down". One cop was surprised, the other disgusted.
-   Non-villainous example: In _Haré+Guu_, the stupid couple lives up to their name when Marie (who was trying to get Haré to like her) asked them how they met and fell in love. They proceed to reminisce and reenact the whole thing, including having Pixellated sex right in front of the 11 year old girl.
-   _Hybrid × Heart Magias Academy Ataraxia_: Reiri holds an audio conference during the epilogue of volume 13, while she's having sex with her biological brother, Kizuna. She pauses midway through the conference when she realizes she's about to cum and abruptly closes the com-link. Then, after catching her breath, she asks him to do it _again_.
-   Happens in _Ikki Tousen: Dragon Destiny_, where Kakuka from Kyoushou's Power Trio and his girlfriend Kaku Bunwa like to discuss strategies when they're having sex.
-   In the Hentai _Jiburiru: the Devil Angel_, the rules state that only women can become angels that battle demons, and in order for her to charge her powers she needs to have sex, and in order to gain new powers she needs to use different techniques and kinks. Naturaly, her boyfriend uses this as an excuse to have sex as frequently as possible, and in episode 4, they are engaging in a bondage session, when one the villains teleports into their room to challenge the girlfriend to a fight, and the boyfriend answers the challenge while he's mounting his girlfriend.
-   Misaki and Usami in _Junjou Romantica_ are walked in on twice; once by Aikawa, second time by Aikawa and Isaka. Usami doesn't seem to care that much, while Misaki tries to flee for his life. Isaka as far as sits on the bedside and says he'll give them ten minutes to finish up _and then keeps sitting on the bedside_. Usagi is not happy about the interruption. However, considering the fact that he's a Bunny-Ears Writer who is notorious with deadlines to the point that Aikawa has almost killed him (literally) on 5 separate occasions trying to get the work in on time, the only thing either Isaka (childhood friend and head editor) or Aikawa (battle-hardened personal editor) think about is those elusive manuscripts (and getting him to even _try_ to promote his books)! Poor Misaki...
-   In _Kite_, the Big Bad Akai walks in on his partner Kanye having sex with what looks like a prepubescent girl. Kanye stops, draws his gun, sighs, says "Oh, it's just you," and then continues on with the sex.
-   In Chapter 32 of _Magical Girl Spec-Ops Asuka_, Brigadier pulls double duty having sex with her girlfriend Pick Scissors Abby while on the radio coordinating the operation against the Magical Five in Ukraine. And she's still doing a good job pleasuring Abby while issuing orders.

-   In Chapter 15 of Maka-Maka, Jun and Nene continue to get it on despite the ringing doorbell, and then a ringing cellphone. And then, in Chapter 19, Nene talks on her cellphone _during_ the act.
-   The Big Bad of the _Meiou Project Zeorymer_ manga is a picture-perfect example of the "doesn't stop having sex even after the messenger bursts in" example given at the top of this page.
-   In Chapter 13 of _Minimum_, Satou's sister talks on her cellphone while she's being fucked by some guy in his (the other guy's) bedroom. Her euphoric speech is borderline unintelligible.
    
    **Satou:** _(Sex or the phone, choose one dammit...!!)_
    
-   Played sickeningly straight in _Monster_ during a scene in which a child wandering around a red light district finds a man about to have sex with a prostitute in a back alley. The man actually tells the child to watch what he's going to do. Made worse by the fact that A) he's a school teacher and B) pays the child afterwards.
-   In _Ninja Scroll_, at one point Kagero reports a massacre to her chamberlain. He's preoccupied. She's disgusted... and possibly jealous, depending on how you interpret the face she makes, since she's a Poisonous Person who can't even kiss someone without lethally poisoning them.
-   In _Nyaruko: Crawling with Love!_, Tamao calls her friend Nyarko's cellphone, only to be told that now isn't a good time... in between moans and gasps of "Oh, Mahiro-san~!" Of course, since this is Nyarko, she's faking it (as usual); it turns out they're in the middle of a horde of monsters, and Mahiro yells at her to quit fooling around and do something before they get killed.
-   This trope is played with, er, more than once in the manga _Our Kingdom_ where Rei will frequently be trying to make-out with Akira when someone walks in on them. Akira's reaction? Horrified embarrassment and denial. Rei's reaction? Kick them out (viciously) and get back to what he was _trying_ to accomplish.
-   In _Sakura Gari_, Souma rapes his servant Masataka, and he doesn't stop when his younger sister catches them despite Masataka's pleas.
-   In the beginning of _Samurai Champloo_, the daimyo's son openly fondles the breasts of one of the women who are with him, while ordering food at Fuu's restaurant.
-   In the rather unsubtle Seinen manga _Übel Blatt_, one major villain — a huge man — is introduced raping a small young girl who goes unnamed. When he is interrupted, he doesn't stop — he murders one of the two messengers by punching through his head, then, once he's done, he hands the young girl off to his horse. Only then does he address the messengers directly. Whether she's killed or not isn't shown, but she gets a very long scream for someone who's being trampled.
-   _Yosuga no Sora_:
    -   In Episode 8, Sora walks in on her brother having sex. Instead of stopping when he sees her standing there, he just looks at her as he continues thrusting.
    -   In Episode 11, it's Sora and her brother who get walked on. Sora is in the middle of her orgasm. And once again, he just continues.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Artesia Afield_, the Palatian mercenary captain Daemander gives a Camp Follower the business in the same tent as several of his lieutenants discussing their employer (Artesia herself). It's the second kind, since the lieutenants obviously find nothing strange about Daemander's actions and don't even take any notice. He only stops pounding the girl when he detects Artesia and her two bodyguards in the tent using an invisibility spell.
-   _Dominic Fortune_ has a double example where one man is having sex with a callgirl while on the phone to another man who is being orally serviced by his secretary. Both men are apparently able to keep the conversation going without the other man being aware.
-   In _The Eternal_, Ikaeden goes to talk with Kurassus while the latter is indulging his extreme tastes with some sex slaves, two of whom might already be dead (one's in a gas mask, another's hanging over a fire, and the other is bent over in front of him as he slices up her backside). Not only does he invite his commanding officer in; in the middle of the conversation, he breaks off mid-sentence: "Of course, Ikaeden, I — their openings are much better when they are cut wider..."
-   Subverted in the graphic novel adaptation of _A Game of Thrones_: Maester Luwin walks into the room just after Ned and Catelyn Stark had sex to deliver a message to the latter. Catelyn reads it then gets up _completely naked_ to burn it in the fireplace. When Ned is taken aback at this, Catelyn points out that Luwin has delivered all their children.
-   In Manifest, Big Bad Saturn has sex with his psychic aide and lover Sibyl while his generals and advisers report on the status of his kidnapped daughter. He briefly stops to yell at the generals, and then asks Sibyl "Who told you to put your robe back on?" before the camera cuts to the next panel.
-   One issue of _The Outsiders_ had Starfire and Jade walking into Shift (a kind of clone of Metamorpho) and Indigo (a robot from the future) having very strange sex in the Pequod. Indigo sensed them coming, but didn't want to spoil the mood.
-   A rare heroic (or at least non-villainous) example takes place in one story in Phil Foglio's _Xxxenophile_ ("K'nitchers at an Exhibition"). A human official's wife starts to get frisky with him during a meeting with the extremely non-human locals. Very frisky. At the end of the meeting, he worries about having offended the locals, while the wife replies they were more likely to offend the houseplants, as the aliens have no idea what they're doing. Meanwhile, in another room, the head local and his companions have much the same discussion! (The only thing that is even remotely a possibility as being their "activity", as least that is visible, is a tiny puff of smoke or vapor above one of the aliens' heads.)

    Fan Works 

-   Played for horror in _Fallout: Equestria - Project Horizons_. Blackjack storms into the office of Stable 99's insane overseer, who proceeds to chew her out while anally raping P-21 with an oxygen bottle.
-   Happens in this Sirius/Lupin fic. Made hilarious by how nonchalant the person walking in on them is.
-   Happens offscreen in this _Persona 5_ fic. When the Phantom Thieves find out that Joker and Ann have been getting busy in Palaces, Makoto points out that they carry the risk of being interrupted by Shadows. Joker flippantly responds that it _has_ happened before, and Ann lustfully reminisces on his ability to multitask. Ryuji is impressed, Makoto isn't.
-   _Servant Shenanigans_: Cu always forgets to lock the door his and Emiya's room, so all too often whenever anyone wants them for something - like poor Mordred - they catch them in the act. They always continue.
-   _Superwomen of Eva 2: Lone Heir of Krypton_: In chapter twelve's omake Misato and Kaji step inside the former's apartment and find Shinji and Asuka making love on the kitchen floor. Misato started screaming them, but they "cheerfully ignored her".
-   _That Elder Wand_ combines this with Interspecies Romance to efficiently horrify Twilight Sparkle and Harry Potter.
-   In _That Epic Plan_, Beyond tries to initiate sex with Light in front of the taskforce, including Light's father.
-   In the _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_ fanfic _Stolen Moments,_ Sena walks in on Noah and Mio. However, because they've only been introduced to the concept of sex a week ago, they don't have the same strange culture around it most people do; they're all embarrassed, but not _that_ embarrassed, and no one sees anything wrong with Sena asking a quick question before leaving.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Very early on, _American Pie presents: Beta House_ gives us an example of the "morally ambiguous" variety.
    -   The second _American Pie_ film has Jim's father walk on him near the beginning. The six pack of beer he then drops on the floor is used as a crude visual metaphor.
    -   Likewise, the third _American Pie_ has Jim talking to his father in his restaurant...while Michelle is under the table. When he's forced to stand up at a certain point, the other patrons are shocked.
-   _Art of the Dead_: When Douglas Winter is going through his house to trying to tell his family that he has acquired the final painting in the set, he enters his son Richie's room and discovers Richie and his girlfriend Becky about to get it on. They are so wrapped up in each other that they don't even notice the interruption.
-   In one scene of _The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans_, a drug-starved McDonagh harasses a couple and illegally searches them for drugs. The girl, who has a pipe and a stash on her, shotguns with him to avoid any trouble. It turns into a bit of tongue wrestling that spirals into them pants-less and bumping bits _in front of her boyfriend on the hood of his car_. But what really nails this scene to the trope is when the disgusted boyfriend tries to leave and McDonagh shoots his gun in the air and orders his _audience_ to keep watching.
-   In _Black Angel Vol. 1_, Chiaki has a telephone conversation with Nogi while the senator is performing cunnilingus on her.
-   Most famously subverted in _Boogie Nights_, where the porn-star wife of a man (William H. Macy) engages in Coitus Uninterruptus with other partners right in front of him, on a regular basis; eventually he gets fed up, and ends up fatally shooting her, her lover(s), and then finally himself.
-   In _Class Act_ when Duncan is caught having sex with Damita by his dad. He didn't exactly get out of position. Then again, he was probably stunned by how happy his dad was that he wasn't gay.
-   Subverted in the 2004 movie _Crash_. Detective Graham Waters (played by Don Cheadle) is having sex when his mother calls asking about his missing younger brother. He hangs up, telling her he can't talk because "I'm having sex with a white woman." The white Hispanic lady in question is not amused at his dismissive treatment of his family and interrupts coitus herself.
-   _The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover_ is a very surreal movie in which the Wife and Lover have sex in the kitchen of a restaurant while the staff continues working around them.
-   _Deconstructing Harry_: In Harry's novel, Ken is having sex with Leslie at a time when they think everyone has left the house. Then his blind grandmother comes in, and he refuses to stop. They both manage to escape undetected as she can't see them, but only narrowly.
-   Brazilian movie _Divã_ had protagonist Mercedes going after her friend's daughter for advice. The girl is having sex when she was supposed to be studying ("I'm giving it a break" "Yeah, you're giving in"). Mercedes just closes the door and talks with the girl from outside (of course for one of the questions, Mercedes just assumed the moaning was the answer).
-   In _Drive Angry_, Milton is having sex with a waitress in a motel room when she asks why he hasn't taken his clothes off. He answers, "I never disrobe before a gunfight", promptly followed by several people breaking into their motel room armed with various weapons. He just proceeds to kill them all without even withdrawing from the waitress. Notably, the experience leaves her terrified out of her her wits and quite possibly traumatized.
-   The scene in _Euro Trip_ where Jamie gets mugged while the camera store girl is giving him a blowjob. Jamie is too ecstatic to care that he's handing over all the group's passports and money.
    -   Later on when Scottie and Mieke are having sex in the confessional booth they're both so lost in their sexual rapture that they barely acknowledge a middle aged woman confessing to them that she's been cheating on her husband - Scottie blankly tells her that God will forgive her and then she is frightened off when she realizes what's going on when she sees Mieke's shapely ass almost literally shoved into her face (in the original version of the scene the old lady actually comes back to watch and offers sex tips to the young couple before finding a man of her own to pleasure her in the adjoining booth — Scottie and Mieke still don't notice her).
-   _Go_: Simon won't stop having sex with the two women he met at a wedding even when he notices the hotel room is on fire. They don't feel the same way once they notice the fire.
-   In _The Great White Hype_, rocker/boxer Terry Conklin makes out with a groupie while negotiating with promoter Fred Sultan and his team. It's treated as perfectly normal.

-   _James Bond_, particularly in _The Spy Who Loved Me_ and _Moonraker_ (where Bond continues in front of his superiors - it helps that he's seen only by camera).
    -   By _For Your Eyes Only_ it was threatening to become a regular fixture:
        
        **M:** Well done on your mission, 007! We're patching you into a live video feed to the Palace and the White House, _without_ first checking to see if you're having sex!
        
    -   Whilst _Moonraker_ is universally regarded as one of the worst 007 films, it does contain the funniest version of this, after Bond has been caught trying to punch his ticket into the Hundred Mile High Club.
        
        **M**: My _god_, what's Bond doing?
        
    -   Which is followed by an _even better_ one:
        
        **Dr. Goodhead:** Take me around the world one more time...
        
    -   The final scene of _A View to a Kill_ is of Bond and Stacey in the shower together when a robot with a remote camera on it piloted by Q homes in on them. Q makes a face and reports back to M that Bond is alive; Bond turns and sees the robot, throws a towel over it, and then turns back to Stacey as if nothing happened.
    -   Similarly, in _Quantum of Solace_, Bond answers the door naked. Neither he nor Mathis even allude to the fact that he has no pants.
    -   Also in _Tomorrow Never Dies_. As Bond and his girl du jour Wai Lin flee from the bad guys, Bond drives their motorcycle over the roofs of several buildings, eventually crashing through an apartment. The copulating couple inside keeps right at it, not even looking up, implying that they're so into each other (so to speak) and what they're doing that they genuinely didn't even notice.
-   _Police Academy_'s Commandant Broussard gets orally serviced by hooker Georgina Spelvin while making a speech to a visiting group of foreign policemen (she is concealed in the base of the lectern he is standing behind).
-   In _Rain Man_, while Charlie and Susanna are making love, Raymond wanders in, sits on the bed, and watches TV.
-   The film _Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves_ portrays the Sheriff of Nottingham as an unrepentant pervert who won't even allow his sex partners to cover up during Coitus Uninterruptus. Late in the movie, he also attempts to rape Maid Marian in full view of the priest and witnesses _during their wedding_.
-   Appears (the extreme version) in _Shakespeare in Love_ during a conversation between Kit Marlowe and Richard Burbage. None of the characters involved is really a villain, and none of them seems particularly disturbed about it. Marlowe mildly scolds Burbage for wasting his energy, and then proceeds to carry out a perfectly normal conversation.
-   In an extreme and probably the greatest example, the movie _Shoot 'Em Up_ has the protagonist in a gunfight with five men, while having sex at the same time. Apparently _great_ sex, to judge by Monica Bellucci's reaction, though that might have at least partially been screams of fear. This is naturally, like everything else in the movie, taken to the point of parody.
-   In the Australian film _Strictly Ballroom_, not only does the villain get a phone call while having sex with his wife, but after hanging up he proceeds to gripe about it to her while she's still gasping in ecstasy.
-   In the _Dirty Harry_ film _Sudden Impact_, one of the male villains is having rough sex with a woman, and hurting her, and enjoying that it hurts her, when the phone rings. He continues to have painful (to her) sex with this woman, while on the phone, after answering the phone with an obscene response.
-   In one scene in _Throw Momma from the Train_, Margaret is able to have sex and carry on an intelligent telephone conversation with her agent at the same time. (Well, after Owen, who had snuck into the room to kill her and is hiding behind the couch, "helpfully" pushes the phone to where she can reach it.)
-   Implied in Michael Bay's _Transformers (2007)_, with Sam Witwicky and Mikaela Banes making out on Bumblebee's bonnet, while the other Autobots look on.
    -   And Bumblebee _was_ his first Lemon.
-   _The Tripper_: When Samantha is looking for Ivan she slides the van door only to find Jade and Muff having sex inside. They don't stop while telling her that they haven't seen him.
-   _Up the Chastity Belt_: Richard and Winnie continue having sex despite Lurkalot and Braggart having a running swordfight through the room.
-   _Vet Hard_: When Koen and Katja are getting it on in the Business Class Lounge (well, sort of), he gets a phone call from Bennie and takes this (considering he is here on a mission for Bennie, and Katja just tagged along), while Katja just "takes care of herself". Bennie hears Katja's moans in the background and after hanging up shouts "we should have left that bitch at home!".
-   In Lu Chuan's _Wang De Sheng Yan_, emperor-to-be Liu Bang is about to be overrun by his erstwhile master Xiang Yu, but his friend Zhiang is initially rebuffed by Liu Bang.
-   In the movie _Where the Truth Lies_, Kevin Bacon's character measures his flings by how they react to being seen naked by hotel staff, although usually not during but immediately after sex.

    Jokes 

-   A Frenchman, an Englishman and an American were discussing the definition of _savoir-vivre_ (a French term that translates to something like "knowing how to live"/"having mastered the art of life"):
    
    **The American**: Well, if I came home one day unexpected and found my wife with a lover in the bedroom and I just walked away as if nothing had happened, I'd call that _savoir-vivre_.
    
    **The Englishman**: Well, if I came home one day unexpected and found my wife with a lover in the bedroom and I just said "A-hem" and walked away, I'd call that _savoir-vivre_.
    
    **The Frenchman**: Well, if I came home one day unexpected and found my wife with a lover in the bedroom, screamed "What the HELL is going on!!" and slammed the door, and they can CONTINUE - THAT is _savoir-vivre_.
    

    Literature 

-   _The Belgariad_: The Nadrak king Drosta Lek Thun admits that he Invokes this, often "holding court" in brothels while in bed with a pair of escorts. Playing up his image as a debauched sybarite — which, as he's happy to admit, he is — both encourages people to underestimate him and keeps away priests of the local divinely-mandated Religion of Evil, stealthily undermining their political power.
-   Combined with a Fakeout Makeout in the _Belisarius Series_. Ethiopian prince Eon is touring Malwa-occupied India with Belisarius, and presenting himself as a spoiled teenage horndog with an insatiable appetite for the local prostitutes. This is all so the heroes can smuggle the fugitive Princess Shakuntala to safety by disguising her as one of Eon's camp followers. When Malwa soldiers burst into Eon's quarters during their search for Shakuntala, a naked Eon tosses her onto his bed, covers her with his body and some sheets, and thrusts vigorously while bawling at the guards for the interruption (without actually stopping his simulated intercourse), leaving the Malwa so scandalized that they barely search his room before fleeing. Eon is mortified and apologizes profusely to the princess, though Shakuntala is simply amused that not all of Eon was faking.
-   Happens in the _Captive Prince_ series when Laurent and Damen finally get together. It causes a cute moment of culture shock because while the latter is embarrassed, the former doesn't think anything of it due to coming from a country where semi-public sex is normal.
-   Earlier in _The City Who Fought_, Simeon interrupts Channa and Amos having sex to tell them that despite their efforts at privacy, he can see them. They do not appreciate this and chew him out to the point where he's genuinely chastised and decides to do better. Of course, not long after that he gets an alert - Space Pirates will dock in forty-two minutes - and realizes that the two are having sex again. He doesn't want to interrupt but this is a legitimate reason, so he does. Channa, hearing the forty-two minutes part, decides that there's enough time to finish and manages to climax after a few seconds more. _Then_ they attend to the emergency.
-   In the Culture novel _Use of Weapons_, a flashback from the protagonist's life shows Elethiomel pissing off his step-brother through this trope. Cheradenine had heard his sister crying out, and when he goes to see what happened, finds her having sex with Elethiomel, who greets him nonchalantly. Cheradenine then runs out, while his sister cries and Elethiomel laughs.
-   In the Herman Wouk novel _Don't Stop the Carnival_, the main character buys a hotel on a Caribbean island, but runs into many problems in the very first day. One of these is that when a middle-aged couple go to their room, they catch the bartender having sex with one of the maids. What really shocks them is that he doesn't even stop, just says something like "Oh, hello, I though you checked out".
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   Near the end of _White Night_, Harry Dresden walks in on Ms. Demeter sitting on John Marcone's lap. Being a Deadpan Snarker to the fullest, he immediately curses himself... for not arriving ten minutes later, as he would have then walked in "_in media res_", which would have been infinitely more awkward for Marcone.
    -   In the short story _Backup_ narrated by Thomas, he ends up talking to Lara on the phone while she's quite audibly having sex. She gives her usual combination of threats/instructions and only gets distracted for a second.
-   In Eric Flint's _Forward the Mage_, the notorious highway robber Rascogne de Sevigneois simultaneously makes love to one of the passengers of the stagecoach he's robbing, and fights a duel with another passenger who takes exception to him seducing another man's wife. It's implied that the only things visible are Rascogne's head and sword arm.
-   Allen Steele's _A King of Infinite Space_ has a slight subversion. The guy doing it is portraying a slave-owning villain, and part of that is a very public blowjob, all to get the protagonist to man up, escape, and try to rescue his girlfriend. It's part of a Batman Gambit.
-   Played entirely straight in _Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil_. The Man doesn't even pull out or wilt, just pauses for a few seconds while people pass the bush he's behind.
-   _The Shadow of the Lion_ has a rare example with sympathetic characters, when Francesca saves Erik and Manfred from the schiopettieri.
-   The main villain in _Silver Wolf, Black Falcon_ is mentioned doing this. Though he dismisses the woman (who never appears again and never had a name in the first place) once he realizes how important the message is.
-   In the Dale Brown novel _Sky Masters_ a redshirt takes an alert call while he is getting disinterestedly... serviced.
-   In the novel _Sleeping Around_ by Catherine Townsend, the protagonist types up an article on a Blackberry and calls her boss to make sure it's been received, all while her boyfriend is going down on her.
-   It occurs off-screen, but in _A Song of Ice and Fire_, Lady Nym says she was in bed with the Fowler twins when news of her father's death reached her.
-   A rare version of Played for Laughs in one Stephanie Plum novel: Stephanie and Lula walk in on a skip and her boyfriend in the middle of an enthusiastic make-up. Stephanie is embarrassed but former hooker Lula just critiques the woman's performance.
-   When Jagang first corrupts the Sisters of the Light in the _Sword of Truth_ series, it's strongly implied that he is getting a blowjob from several already corrupted ones while he is speaking to them.
-   In _Wizard and Glass_, villain Eldred Jonas is having sex with his mistress when they hear an oil patch getting blown up by the heroes. They don't stop, because they "had reached the point where it was impossible to stop, even under threat of death or dismemberment."
-   The book _WTF!? Survival Guide_ lists one of the things to do if your partner gets a phone call during nookie as "Make a game of it!" see how long your partner can remain coherent while you screw her while she's on the phone, and maybe even let the other guy play too!
-   _The Book of Ahmad Ibn Fadlān_, the travelogue of an Arab envoy who travelled in Central Asia and Eastern Europe in 921-22 CE, mentions this twice in connection to the Rūs:
    -   Certain slave traders from the Rūs regularly visit the land of the Volga Bulghars. The slavers reside in large wooden houses where several of them live together with the beautiful slave girls they offer for sale. The slavers are used to having sex with their slave girls in full view of their companions, and if a customer happens to come in to buy slaves from a slaver who ist just having intercourse, "the man does not get up off her until he has satisfied himself."
    -   The king of the Rūs presides over his trusty company of four hundred retainers on an elevated throne (which is "immense and encrusted with the finest gems") where forty slave concubines sit by his side, and sometimes he has sex with one of them in front of his retainers "without coming down from his throne".
-   _From Russia with Love_. Darko Kerim is having sex with a Honey Trap when a bomb placed against the wall of his house explodes. The girl's understandable Freak Out is not helped by the fact that Kerim insists on finishing.
-   In Robert Anton Wilson's _Schrödinger's Cat_ trilogy one "Stu Spudnik", likely a No Celebrities Were Harmed version of _Playboy_ magazine founder (and Mr Wilson's ex-boss) Hugh Hefner, has been inspired by a supposed history of the Roman emperor Caligula to force as many employees as possible deal with him while he is being serviced by one centrefold model or another—-it is unclear whether he gets off more on the physical pleasure or on his employees' uncomfortableness.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the _The Almighty Johnsons_ episode "Folkmoot", when Stacey and Zeb hook up because of Sjöfn's powers, other characters repeatedly walk in on them, but they don't stop.
-   Occurs in _Angel_'s fifth season, though not for the usual reasons — Eve and Angel are under a spell forcing them to carry out Lorne's (unintentional) instructions, and if other people want to walk into the room and discuss what's causing everyone to behave oddly, they'll just have to deal.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In Episode 9 of _Band of Brothers_, this trope is subverted, as Captain Speirs walks in on Private Janovec having an "intimate moment" with a German fraulein. Naturally, Janovec gets out of bed and salutes Speirs. (No, not THAT way!)
-   Baltar on _Battlestar Galactica_ would often have this happen with his Not-So-Imaginary Friend. When seen from the perspective of the character who walked in on him (e.g. Starbuck), he appears to be masturbating.
-   In the UK _Coupling_ Jane and Oliver's first time is interrupted by Steve to tell them Susan was having a baby. Steve and Susan then stay to chat.
-   Sweets and Daisy were interrupted at least twice on _Bones_. She ran after Brennan and left him sitting on the floor frustrated the second time.
-   In one episode of _Brothers & Sisters_, Kevin and Luke are just about to have sex when Sarah's great timing makes her knock at their door at this precise moment, prompting Luke to call her "Sarah Interruptus".
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_. In "Smashed", Buffy and Spike are making out so passionately they don't even notice the building is collapsing around them, including a massive beam that crashes to the floor seconds after they've moved out of its way.
    -   They're so preoccupied that they don't even notice that they're causing the building to collapse. The next morning when they wake up, Buffy asks when the house fell down.
    -   Then, in "Gone", Buffy is turned invisible and is having sex with Spike when Xander walks in looking for her—Spike pretends he was doing push-ups. Naked. In his bed. Buffy, invisible at the time, had no problem trying to keep the sex going while Xander was still standing there.
-   In the _Curb Your Enthusiasm_ episode "The Larry David Sandwich", Larry answers a phone call while having sex with his wife. She's quite upset about it, and when he hangs up, she tells him to "get off".
-   There's a scene in _Farscape_ where Crichton walks in on D'Argo and Chiana. Funny because it happens _twice in one episode_ - the first time Crichton is suitably distraught, but the second time he's so upset about his own problems that he just sits down right there and starts talking to D'Argo (even casually acknowledging Chiana partway through), prompting D'Argo to say sarcastically, "Well, why don't you just sit down and tell us all about it?".
-   Recurring sketch "The Shags" in _The Fast Show_ features a couple having sex while, for example, the removal men carry their bed into their new home (they cheerfully tell the jaw-dropped neighbours how pleased they are to meet them).
-   In the _Firefly_ episode "Out of Gas", we see a flashback where Mal goes to the engine room to get a status report on repairs to find his mechanic-at-the-time Bester busily putting it to a local girl with a starship fetish. Bester had... a hard time pulling himself away from his new friend to tell Mal why the ship wasn't fixed yet. But the girl in question was Mal's future mechanic Kaylee, who proceeded to impress Mal by correctly diagnosing and fixing the engine problem right then and there. It's even implied that they'd only been doing it in the engine room in the first place because Kaylee wanted get a look at the engines, and was busy diagnosing the problem while Bester was occupied. Kaylee _really_ likes engines.
    
    **Kaylee:** I saw the problem plain as day when I was down there on my back before.
    
-   _Friends_ brought us Joey's (offscreen, though audible) performance in a porn movie. In which he performs this trope as a photocopier repair man.
    
    **Joey:** I can't get to the copier, I'm thinking "What do I do? What do I do?" So I just watch them have sex!
    
-   _Frontier (2016)_: When Grace comes back to Fort James and finds her Alehouse has been turned into a brothel in her absence, she storms into Chesterfield's room where he's having sex with Imogen at that moment. He doesn't let her presence interrupt him and just continues his business in front of her.

    **Tom Ryan:** Sergeants Ryan and St. John, Palm Springs P.D..  
    **Brenda:** Can you get back in 10 minutes?  
    **Tom Ryan:** Cheaper than renting a video.  
    **Cassie St. John:** Are you Brenda, the manager?  
    **Brenda:** Is there any way this can wait  
    **Cassie:** We're here to talk about Mark Ripley, one of your tenants.  
    **Brenda:** There's no one here by that name.  
    **Cassie:** We traced a phone number by Ripley to his condominium apartment in this complex. J4. (Tom shows Brenda a photo)  
    **Brenda:** That's Donnie. Donnie Travis. Apartment J4. Nice guy. Great swimmer. Great body!  
    **Cassie:** Great.
    
-   In Season 7 Episode 16 of _House_, House conducts a meeting with his team while lying in bed with a hooker. Several times.
-   In the HBO miniseries _John Adams_, of all things, the title character bursts into Benjamin Franklin's suite to find him engaged in a game of bathtub chess with a French noblewoman. Seeing as how it is 1777 and all, Adams finds the scene so scandalous that he barely manages to stammer that Franklin has been appointed as lead ambassador.
-   In Christopher Titus's comedy special _Love is Evol_, he tells the story of his own conception. It involves his father going to his ex-girlfriend's (Titus' mother) house which eventually leads to sex (though, since his mom was crazy, his dad was of course palming a blade, just in case), in a segment that incinerates the line with a tactical nuke, then pisses on the irradiated ashes. In the middle of it, her new boyfriend shows up, banging on the front door and crying. The elder Titus reviews his options:
    
    I figured I could stop and be offended, **or...** I could get louder and become the offender. That’s right, kid. You were conceived during revenge sex.
    
-   The _Misfits_ Christmas Special features an embittered, corrupt Priest counting some wads of stolen money and receiving oral sex from a girl in a Santa hat (for extra evil points, she's under the influence of a sex-pheromone-manipulating superpower at the time, so he's actually sexually assaulting her). When he is interrupted by a group of six people, he just holds a conversation with them as though absolutely nothing unusual was happening. Although he does pull a few interesting facial expressions.
-   In _Nip/Tuck_, Escobar Gallardo uses this to intimidate Sean.
    
    "If I wanted it to be, this _\[i.e. the random girl he's plowing\]_ could be your wife".
    
-   Although not sexually explicit, Nick walks in on Schmidt and Jess's sister Abby in season 3 of _New Girl_. Schmidt is tied up, lying on the kitchen countertop with an apple in his mouth as Abby stands at the stove. Nick is horrified, but Abby simply looks up at him and says non-chalantly "I'm melting chocolate."
-   _Peaky Blinders_: Tommy Shelby apparently doesn't believe in knocking and bursts in on his brother John and John's wife Esme mid-sex. His excuse is that they should've locked the door, as it could have been anyone. John and Esme are much more annoyed that embarrassed. After he leaves, John and Esme start back up again.
-   In a nastier than usual example of this trope, in Season 8, Episode 3 of _The Practice_, instead of seeing the example we get it in the backstory. A woman was cheating on her husband with his best friend for _six years_. When the judge asks him how he finally discovered his wife's affair, he explains that he came home from work earlier than usual one day to pleasantly surprise her. He discovered his best friend's car outside but thought nothing of it; his best friend sometimes comes over to fix things after all. So he went into the house, and discovered his best friend and his wife having sex...and when his wife and the man's best friend saw him arrive, they reacted by continuing to have sex. The judge and jury are outraged upon hearing this. To be fair, the woman defends herself by saying that she was in the middle of an orgasm when her husband walked in and was therefore not mentally clear enough to stop, but this does not win her sympathy with the judge since in order to be climaxing she had to have made the choice to have sex first.
-   _Queer as Folk (US)_ has Brian Kinney, local The Casanova, engaging in various sexual acts with a pair of twins. He is interrupted in the throes of passion by a phone call informing him that his father has passed away. The twins express their condolences, and suggest they leave. Brian's response? "Who told you to stop?"
-   _Rome_'s Atia frequently engages in sex whilst household servants are about. This says more about her character than it does about how historical concepts of privacy may have differed from our own. Marc Antony, from the same series, also is a frequent engager of public sex (once stopping his entire legion to have sex with a shepherd girl they ran across) and he's also portrayed as a mean, predatory character.
-   Used as a standard running gag on the HBO series _Sex and the City_, in order to underscore the women-characters as being liberated (or jaded) beyond modesty.
    -   Samantha and Richard are engaged in sex on his private jet, while both casually converse with the Pilot who walks in, embarrassed.
    -   Charlotte is having sex with her husband, Trey, while his mother Bunny barges into their apartment unannounced; rather than being embarrassed and covering up, both simply laugh at Bunny, embarrassing her into never bothering her again (see "territorial dominance," below).
    -   Samantha is having sex _Basic Instinct_ style with a villain, when the police barge in to arrest him; unfazed, she calmly asks what the problem is, and the embarrassed officers ask her to "please remove your handcuffs from him, so we can put on ours."
    -   Samantha actually averts this in one scene while on a double date with a new girlfriend. When the other woman starts performing oral sex on her date in the _middle of a crowded restaurant_, a shocked and disgusted Samantha storms out.
    -   Miranda begins dating someone (played by Will Arnett) who enjoys having sex in public places. Although at first she finds it arousing and exciting, things take a turn for the worst when they finally have sex at his apartment. Lying on the bed, he's just about to climax when his parents walk in, and he receives further gratification. He finishes as his parents stand there, unamused but not completely horrified (as if this has happened before). Miranda is humiliated and needless to say, stops seeing him.
-   The UK comedy _Shameless (UK)_. Fiona walks in on Kev and Veronica in the act. "Sorry, I came in the back way." "You're not the only one." After Fiona's asked what she came over to ask, they're right back at it. Almost before Fiona's even off-screen.
-   _Snuff Box_ Matt is interrupted by the girl he's screwing's boyfriend, while being filmed by his own date: "Either go away or stay and watch. Either way, shut up!"
-   Happens frequently in _Spartacus: Blood and Sand_.
    -   Lucretia and Batiatus casually discuss business while stripping and being "fluffed" by their slaves before sex, without ever even looking at them. This is shown to be the ultimate in Roman decadence: having slaves to do your foreplay for you.
    -   Barca and Pietros also have sex in their cell, within plain view of anyone who walks by; but really, where else could they go?
    -   Many slaves are also forced to have sex in front of the Romans during fancy parties as a twisted porn show. It's deeply traumatic experience for many of the slaves involved.
    -   Many members of the Rebellion later get up to having sex in the open streets after they have occupied the city of Sinuessa, although the main cast do not.
    -   The cheaper Roman brothels are shown to almost exclusively function like this, as they don't have private rooms.
-   _Six Feet Under_:
    -   When Hiram visits for dinner, Claire walks in on Ruth and him squeezed into the corner of the kitchen giggling. In a Daydream Surprise, Ruth and Hiram are actually having sex, and he turns around to non-chalantly greet her.
    -   In season 3, Brenda's mother buys a painting by Claire's art teacher Olivier at a charity art show. Brenda returns to her mother's apartment after the event and walks in on her having sex with Olivier. Rather than stopping, Olivier continues thrusting. Her mother appears apologetic, and implies they couldn't stop because they were past the point-of-no-return.
-   A version of this trope appears in the _Torchwood_ episode "Adrift". Gwen walks in on Jack and Ianto having sex, or getting there (lots of really heavy making out and both are shirtless, but we don't see if there are pants). She's embarrassed and leaves, but Ianto chases after her (after putting a shirt on) to find out what she wanted. Jack makes a half-hearted attempt at putting his own shirt on and likewise goes to find out what she wants. Once they talk to her, Jack immediately calls Ianto back to the other room to continue sexy-time. While Gwen is still standing there.
-   In _Trailer Park Boys_, Ricky and Lucy gamely — and loudly — carry on trying for a baby while a chain of people strike up a conversation with them from outside their trailer window. Not only do they not stop, they go at it hard enough to collapse the trailer.
-   Played straight on _True Blood_: Sookie and Pam walk in on Eric entertaining Yvetta for six hours straight in his basement. He casually leaves the dancer, still chained up, to discuss the whereabouts of her fiance in his altogether.
-   In _UnREAL (2015)_, Quinn the hard-bitten reality show producer is barking orders to the production crew over walkie-talkie while her boss Chet is plowing her from behind.
-   _Without a Trace_. An episode starts with two FBI agents going at it when the woman's phone rings. Although the man halts his, um, movements, he remains on top of her (and presumably inside her as well) while she has a perfectly normal conversation with their supervisor, even sneaking in kisses in between words. They get back to it after she hangs up and not until _his_ phone rings do they stop.

    Music 

-   Dar Williams' "The Pointless, Yet Poignant Crisis of a Co-ed":
    
    Well sometimes, life gives us lessons sent in ridiculous packaging
    
    And he gave no apology
    
    He didn't pull up the sheets, and I think he even smiled as he said to me:
    
    "Well, I guess our dreams went up in smoke - heh, heh"
    
-   In The-Dream's "I Love Your Girl", rapper Young Jeezy who makes a guest appearance describes himself as the "Type of nigga to take a phone call while he serving you".
-   Dillie Keane's song "Dogging," about an older couple making out (and then some) in their new car. Eventually, a crowd gathers, the police arrive and join in the fun as does a film crew and gives the couple a spot on a new TV program
-   In the video for Girl Band's single "Paul," which revolves around a whole cast of Depraved Kids Show Hosts in farm animal costumes, the backup-dancer protagonist walks in on the star, a veteran actor who plays the yellow rooster, banging a much younger woman in the dressing room. They both turn to him, smile, and sing. This may or may not be real, as the protagonist by this point has descended into a drug-induced subjective reality.

    Stand-Up Comedy 

-   In "Pedro And Man At The Drive-Inn" from Cheech & Chong's _Los Cochinos_ album, Man goes over to the next car over to ask for something that they could use to pry open the trunk with, only to find a guy making out with a girl inside the car. The two of them keep going at it, though, as Man is given something just before the climax happens.
-   Christopher Titus learned that his conception was a result of this. His mother, Juanita, called his father, Ken, over to her place when he was on leave from the National Guard, greeted him in practically nothing, and they proceeded to go at it... and then her boyfriend starts knocking at the door. Ken realized he had two options - become offended and leave, or become the offende_r_ and continue. No points for guessing which he decided on.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Queen of Swords in _Princess: The Hopeful_ provides a downplayed example, and also one where the interruption is for the woman. She is known run her country while simultaneously kissing and cuddling a lover on the throne.

    Video Games 

-   _Crusader Kings II_ has an event during feast event chains where one of your guests gets, uh, overexcited and bangs a serving girl in full view of the party. Depending on various factors your character may be embarrassed by this, or possibly impressed by the male participant's virility.
-   In _Rimworld_, colonists assigned to do jobs during sleeping hours will cheerfully walk into bedrooms while couples are right in the middle of "lovin'" to lay down flooring, sweep up dirt, or fix wiring without anyone batting an eye.
-   In _The Sims 2_ if you get a pair of characters to "woohoo" in the changing room of a clothing store, any other characters in the clothing store will cheer for you.
    -   Which can lead to unintentional comedy if the audience includes the sim's family members.
        -   Aside from children, who will run to the cheering, see what is happening, realize who it is, and _run away in humiliation_ (to the edge of the lot).
    -   Well, some of them just look exasperated. Especially the cashiers. Also, this works for photobooths too.
    -   Better yet, they seem completely oblivious even when "woohooing" in their homes/hotels/etc. They won't "start" woohooing in bed or in the hot tub with other sims in the room, but once they're in the middle of it, any number of sims can walk in and out as they please.
        -   Of course, that rule applies only to sims who are a child or older, they'll do whatever they want if a toddler or baby is in the room
    -   It gets slightly disturbing if you get your sim to tell their cat/dog to "try for kitten/puppy". Assuming the cat/dog accepts, upon entering a kennel _any_ sim in the vicinity will then run to the kennel where the cats/dogs are "dancing the horizontal tango", and will then proceed to cheer…
    -   Averted in the original _The Sims_, though—other Sims walking in (in the relatively few circumstances when Sims could actually "woohoo") would cause the woohoo-ers to break it up.
    -   Also averted in Sims 3 if you have a couple attempt to go for it at a stranger's house, you'll be called out for inappropriate behaviour and kicked out.
    -   Mods and hacks that install sexual behavior do not usually include the privacy requirement that ordinary Woohoo does, so two sims may start engaging in the activity while an other sim is in the room and it will not faze anyone.
-   In _Yearning: A Gay Story_, one of your possible visits to the Queers & Allies club room can lead to you and James walking in on Dan having sex with another man in the room and Dan, being a proud manwhore, doesn't stop even when he realizes you and James are there. Judging from James' resigned reaction to all this, Dan doing this is a regular occurrence — and if you're pursuing Dan, it's fully possible for _you_ to be the man Dan has coitus uninterruptus with in front of James.
-   In _Yumina the Ethereal_, during the sex scene with Nayuta Kagura, the "action" will be... projected on the gym's screen. Nayuta doesn't stop it.

According to Snadhya's "sister" Khaless this is a regular occurrence and a way for students to earn favors.

-   In _The Last Days of Foxhound_, President Solidus gets a call from Ocelot at the same time as he's getting something else, too.
-   _Ménage à 3_ is occasionally prone to this trope, being a sex comedy about a lot of people with little shame and weird priorities. See the comic's own page for examples.
-   _Oglaf_: In "Ranger Ron Returns!", it turns out that even Destroyer Deities are prone to the awkwardness of this trope, so people keep the world from ending by staging a week of constant sex around the prophesied date of his return.
    
    **The Redeemer of Purity:** Um... I'll just come back next year, okay?
    
-   In _The Order of the Stick_, Belkar is awesome enough that he doesn't need to stop making out with someone just to stab someone else.

-   Referenced in _Questionable Content_ where Faye's little sister was caught during cunnilingus with her girlfriend by their mother, who didn't know she was a lesbian.

-   In _Think Before You Think_, Julia walks in on Becky and Jason in her dorm room while they're getting undressed. Becky reacts nonchalantly to the interruption.

-   _Code Ment_: In episode 12, we get the moment from _Code Geass_ where Nina was busy pleasuring herself on a table. In the original show, when Nunually entered, Nina respectfully stopped despite Nunually being blind and unaware. Here...
    
    **Nunnally**: Lelouch, there you are. I think Nina's really sick. I walked in on her in the student faculty room and she sounded like a dying coyote.
    
-   In _The Gamer's Alliance_, Dreadlord Leraje of the Northern Horde doesn't stop having sex with a female slave even when his lieutenant Nobuo arrives to deliver a report.

Nobuo keeps his cool, albeit barely.

-   _Archer_
    
    -   It appears that the major problem that caused Lana to break up with Archer was his habit of accepting phone calls from his mother during sex, without even pausing the act.
    
    **Archer:** It's OK, I can do both.
    
    -   In _Jeu Monegasque_, an entire scene has Mallory talking to Archer while he's lounging in a hot tub. When she leaves, a woman surfaces from the water, revealing she had been giving him a blow job the whole time. He considers her a Sex Goddess since as he says: "Not many women can bring me to orgasm in front of my mother."
