_"This fun, all-ages activity brings history alive! All you need is a bow, an arrow, an apple, and an idiot."_

Shooting an apple or some other item off another character's head, to show off one's Improbable Aiming Skills. Usually with a bow and arrow.

This is based entirely on the legend of William Tell, though the same story has existed before his time in similar variations. In the legend, William Tell, who originally came from Bürglen, was known as an expert shot with the crossbow. In his time, the Habsburg emperors of Austria were seeking to dominate Uri. Albrecht (or Hermann) Gessler, the newly appointed Austrian Vogt of Altdorf, raised a pole in the village's central square and hung his hat on top of it, demanding that all the townsfolk bow before the hat. When Tell passed by the hat without bowing to it, he was arrested. (In some versions, Tell told Gessler that he didn't know about the law, but then boldly insulted him by saying he'd never have bowed before it even if he had.) As Cool and Unusual Punishment, he was forced to shoot an apple off the head of his son, Walter. Otherwise, both would be executed. Tell was promised freedom if he successfully made the shot. On 18 November 1307, Tell split an apple balanced on top of his son's head with a bolt from his crossbow. Gessler noticed that before the shot Tell had removed two crossbow bolts from his quiver, not one, and after the shot asked him why. Tell replied that if he had killed his son, he would have turned the crossbow on Gessler himself. An enraged Gessler had Tell arrested, but he escaped then later ambushed Gessler and shot him through the heart.

Needless to say (and since when has that ever stopped us from saying?), **Don't Try This at Home**. There's a _reason_ the trope-naming incident was such a big deal: _It's shooting a deadly weapon at a small object near a person's head._ Mess up, and someone is likely going to become seriously injured or even die.

Sometimes played for laughs like the target suggesting a more suitable fruit on his head, like a watermelon!

A common variant involves shooting something, like a cigarette or a straw, out of the target's mouth. Compare Close-Call Haircut and Hat Damage. Sister trope to Near-Miss Groin Attack, which involves the other end of the body.

Compare Splitting the Arrow, the signature feat of another legendary Master Archer. Also compare Knife-Throwing Act, another high-stakes display.

    Advertising 

-   In one of the old Federated commercials in the 1980's, Shadoe Stevens (as Fred Rated) shoots merchandise off the head of a female assistant (apparently missing his last shot, as he gets a squeamish look and frantic stage hands rush past him to assist the girl).
-   This ad for Gillette featuring Tennis player Roger Federer.
    -   Also this Head ad featuring tennis players Maria Sharapova and Novak Djokovic. Djokovic challenges Sharapova to show off her sharpshooting skills by hitting a tennis can off his head. Sharapova ends up hitting him in a...sensitive place.
-   One PSA of old showed a fellow (in Robin Hood's Iconic Outfit) pulling off the stunt. Everyone celebrates, and that means drinks all around. So, then there are murmurs of "bet he can't do it again", and drunk logic being what it is, the whole scene is set up again, but with everyone drunk....
-   An amazingly irresponsible bubblegum ad from The Golden Age of Comic Books has a kid demonstrating his skill as an archer by shooting the bubble being blown by his bubblegum-chewing buddy. You can check it out here at _Comics Make No Sense_.
-   One of Jim Henson's Wilkins Coffee commercials has Wilkins shanghai Wontkins into this. Evidently, he missed his target.
    
    **Wilkins:** We can still use the apple again!
    
-   Averted in a Red Bull commercial where William Tell has a shaky hand so his son gives him Red Bull to sharpen the mind and the body. Tell then realizes he should shoot the apple, then put it on his son's head.
-   An Italian ad for an apple-flavored candy has a Robin Hood-like William trying his famous stunt... with said candy in lieu of an actual apple. By everyone else's reaction after he shoots the arrow, he didn't hit it...

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Coffin Princess Chaika_: In season 1 episode 8, Toru and Chaika do this performance.
-   _Fist of the North Star_ used this as a Kick the Dog moment in an early episode, with one of Diamond's men forcing a villager to try to shoot a can off the head of his son with a bow and arrow. When the father can't go through with it, the scumbag takes it upon himself to "help" him, taking hold of the bow and arrow in a Hands-On Approach fashion, but deliberately shaking up the poor guy's aim just to be a sadistic asshole. When the arrow finally does get launched, Kenshiro intervenes before it can go into the boy's throat, catching the arrow between two fingers with _Nishi Shinkuu Ha_ before sending it into the mook's shoulder.
-   In episode 12 of _Jewelpet Happiness_, Apel kidnaps Sango and ties her to a fake tree in a theatre, then puts a mochi on her head and challenges anyone to shoot it with a bow and arrow.

There's some point about being trapped in a destined eternal horror.
-   _Samurai Champloo_. In "The Art of Altercation", our three adventurers are (as usual) broke, so raise money with a demonstration of their swordplay.

It doesn't help that Mugen and Jin are visibly hung-over from last night's debauchery.
-   A variation of this occurs in episode 9 of _Upotte!!_. Sig annoys HK by calling her Chuusuri-chan, and Chuusuri shoots the cover on the book Sig was reading on the beach named Wilhelm Tell, which featured an arrow piercing an apple on the cover.

-   In _Urusei Yatsura_ this is the traditional duel of the Mendo family: shooting an apple on the head of the opponent... Using a _cannon_. Upon finding out, Ataru demanded to know how they had managed to not die off already if they do such stupid things.

    Comic Books 

-   The William Tell scene is parodied in _Asterix in Switzerland_, where Asterix meets the local Swiss people who are having an archery contest. A little boy eating an apple is ordered to hang the target on a tree and while he is busy doing this, he balances his apple on his head. While Asterix is aiming and waiting until the boy is ready, Obelix sneezes which causes Asterix's arrow to be fired involuntarily. The scene is subverted by the arrow hitting the bull's eye of the intended target, when it _looked_ like it might have hit the apple. The Swiss liked the spectacle, but still feel that "something is missing", causing one of them to mutter: "Yes, but what?"
-   In one Golden Age _Batman_ story, Batman fast-talks the Joker and Penguin into a marksmanship competition where they shoot small vases off his and Robin's heads. Both of them make the shot, enabling the heroes to use the vase shards to cut the ropes they're tied with.
-   In a _Tim Traveller_ story in _The Beano_, Tim, unable to make a hole in his conker, goes back in time to find William Tell. William, bored with constantly shooting apples on various people's heads, relishes the extra challenge that comes with shooting such a small target.

    _\[beat, followed by Gaston working intensively\]_  
    **Fantasio:** Sudden insomnia, huh?

-   _Suske en Wiske_: In "Lambiorix" Tante Sidonia has to aim her longbow (and not a crossbow, as you might think) at the apples on Suske and Wiske's heads. Trying to hit two apples with one arrow is a bit more complex than what William Tell had to accomplish, but she manages to pull it off by aiming at a pillar left from them, which causes the arrow to ricochet to the right splitting both apples in the process.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage)_: The turtles do this as a form of training... and to make fruit salads for their picnics.

-   In the cartoon book _I Hate Computers_ a computer, duh, is the target. (Too bad the book is from 1984, so it was a bit too early for an "Apple" bonus gag.) To even the odds a bit the shootist has a gun...and is blind.
-   Part of Willie's Knife-Throwing Act in _Modesty Blaise_.
-   Used in a _Mutt and Jeff_ strip:
    
    **Jeff:** I pitch a pretty good game of baseball! Hold still, Mutt, and I'll knock this apple off the top of your head!  
    **Mutt:** What? Are you crazy?  
    **Jeff:** Why? I'll bet cha two bucks I can do it?

So, by aiming at Severine, Silva actually won the contest, because the glass fell off her head as she slumped to the ground.

    Folklore 

-   William Tell, of course.
-   Henning Wulf, or von Wulfen, of Wewelsfleth in Holstein sided with Count Gerhard in 1472 and was banished by King Christian I of Denmark. In a folk tale, the king had him shoot an apple off his son's head, and a window in the Wewelsfleth church depicted the boy with an apple on his head, pierced through by the arrow, while Henning's bow was undrawn but there was another arrow between his teeth. Between archer and boy there was a wolf.
-   The earliest version of this trope may be from the 12th century, in Saxo Grammaticus' version of the story of Palnatoki, whom he calls Toko (_Gesta Danorum_ Book 10, chapter 7). Toko is made to shoot an apple from the head of the future king Sven Forkbeard, his foster son. Notable that it's Svein's real father Harald Bluetooth who knowingly does this to his biological son.
-   One related story turns the motif on its head: after matching him in swimming and in other shooting contests, King Olaf of Norway converted Eindriði Pansa (the Splay-Footed) from heathenry by shooting at either a chess piece or a writing tablet on Eindriði's son's head. The king's shot narrowly missed but the boy was unharmed; Eindriði gave in to his mother's and sister's pleas and did not try the feat himself.

    Gamebooks 

-   _Lone Wolf_ — _The Kingdom of Terror_: Lone Wolf witnesses such a scene in the city of Varetta, although one that doesn't involve bow or crossbow. In a huge tavern filled with soldiers, some men punished for cowardice are standing in line with a fruit on their head, while a rider on horse from the same regiment tries to skewer it with a lance! Naturally, the watching mercenaries are taking bets on whether the cavalier succeeds or fails.

    Jokes 

-   Two boys are playing this trope. The boy with the crossbow shoots — but hits the other boy's left eye instead. He shoots again — hitting the right eye.
    
    **Now-blind boy:** I'll go home!  
    **Boy with crossbow:** Come on, don't be a spoilsport!  
    **Now-blind boy:** I have to, my mom said I have to be at home when it's getting dark!
    
-   In another joke, three grown (and drunk) men are playing this with a woman being the "target". The first man manages to shoot through the apple. He declares: "I am William Tell!" The second man shoots through the arrow and the apple. He declares: "I am Robin Hood!" Then, the third man shoots through... her forehead. He declares: "I am sorry."

    Literature 

-   In _1066 and All That_, the unpopular reign of Rufus is brought to a Good End this way:
    
    "Rufus was hunting one day in the New Forest, when William Tell (the memorable crackshot, inventor of Cross-bow puzzles) took unerring aim at a reddish apple, which had fallen on to the King's head, and shot him through the heart. Sir Isaac Walton, who happened to be present at the time, thereupon invented the Law of Gravity."
    
-   In a _Babylon 5_ Expanded Universe novel, G'Kar fantasizes a variation of this while a prisoner on Centauri Prime during the Shadow War... a variation involving Emperor Cartagia, a large gun, and a raisin.
-   In Sonmi's storyline in _Cloud Atlas_, Boom-Sook Kim gets drunk and does this to Sonmi after his friends mock his marksmanship. He starts with a melon and moves down to increasingly smaller fruits. This is what leads to Mephi taking Sonmi away from him and placing her in a more friendly environment.
-   In the first _Doom_ novel, Flynn Taggart reminisces on the day his comrade and best friend Arlene Sanders first joined the Marines and took care of any latent Stay in the Kitchen mentality they had by participating in a William Telling contest with the best marksman in the unit. They both took a turn with an apple on the head and being the shooter, and both hit the apple. Some of the guys started calling her "Will" afterwards. It's the first hint of her marksmanship, which Flynn admits is much better than his.
-   On _Gor_ the Wagon Peoples had a similar thing as a contest of skill - a slavegirl would stand in profile holding a piece of fruit in her teeth and a warrior would lance it while galloping by on the local equivalent of a horse. They'd do it while she was facing him head-on.
    -   And if she really loved him she would swallow. To explain: a girl accidentally stabbed in the back of the mouth was shown to have been swallowing the blood released by the (non-fatal) injury rather than let her owner lose face by forfeiting the contest.
-   In Heinrich Kramer's 1486 _Malleus Maleficarum_ (Book 2, chapter 16), a similar story to the William Tell legend occurs: Punker, Puncker, or Puncher of Rohrbach in the Upper Rhineland is said to have been ordered by "a very eminent person" in about 1430 to prove his extraordinary marksmanship (regarded by Kramer as a sign of consorting with the devil) by shooting a penny off the cap on his young son's head without disturbing the cap. He, too, kept a second arrow in reserve to kill the prince in case he failed.
-   James Bond does this in _The Man with the Golden Gun_. Infiltrating Scaramanga's business as his assistant, Bond is told to liven up the festivities after a meeting between criminals at Scaramanga's unfinished hotel. He asks to borrow Scaramanga's gun, and uses it to shoot a pineapple that a singer is wearing on her head.
-   _Monte Cassino_ by Sven Hassel. Porta takes up shooting at the Americans with a bow and arrow, and adopts the name Red Flame (for his red hair) after killing eight officers in two days. An Alaskan sergeant takes offense and challenges Porta to shoot a forage cap that he places on top of his helmet. If he misses, he and the other Native Americans in the unit will hunt Porta down and castrate him. Porta makes the shot successfully and is acclaimed by both sides, until their commanding officer turns up and angrily orders everyone to get back to fighting the war.
-   In the "Tale of Heming Aslaksson", an Icelandic short tale from the _Book of Flatey_ (c. 1390), Harald Hardrada challenges the archer Hemingr to shoot a hazelnut off his younger brother Björn's head, which he does.
-   In one book of _The Lightbringer Series_, Gunner, generally regarded as the greatest shot in the world, claims he can do this with a captive Gavin Guile. Gavin ups the stakes by putting the apple _in_ his mouth and presenting his profile instead of the traditional shot off the top of the head. Even further complicating this is the fact that they're doing this on a rocking boat rather than on land. Gunner nails the shot.
-   In _Slay And Rescue_ by John Moore, Prince Charming dares a man who says the tales of his skills are exaggerated to shoot an apple off his head. The man succeeds, but before the arrow strikes, Charming has drawn his sword and split the arrow lengthwise.

    -   One of the plays in _Suikoden III_, which includes William Tell... and can _screw up_ if you pick incompatible actors as William Tell and his son. Will net a boo, but who cares, it's funnier that way!

-   _Taz-Mania_: According to "Unhappy Together", 'William Tell' is favourite game of the Platypus Brothers and Daniel gets quite upset when he thinks Timothy is playing it with Taz.
-   An episode of _Total Drama Island_ had a "Reverse Willam Tell" challenge, wherein one member of each team must balance an arrow on their heads, while a teammate must fire crabapples<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  from a slingshot—blindfolded, no less—to try to knock the arrow off.
-   Happened on _Tom and Jerry_ at least once, with the apple on Jerry's head.
-   In the Van Beuren Studios Little King cartoon "A Royal Good Time", the King has his servants place apples on their heads, which he perfectly shoots off with his rifle as he moves along.
-   For some reason this was part of a "Cutest Kitty" competition on _The Twisted Whiskers Show_.
-   One scene of _The Venture Brothers_ has Hank and Dean trying to do it to each other. It doesn't work out very well.
-   In a non-projectile example, Aviva from _Wild Kratts_ tests the raptorial forelegs for the Praying Mantis Power Disc on Jimmy, snatching an apple from on top of his head. Jimmy is clearly nervous that he's going to be struck by the oncoming appendages.

    Real Life 

-   This is such a common problem that many archery clubs will ban you outright for mentioning the legend or joking about performing such a stunt.
-   William S. Burroughs accidentally killed his wife while trying to shoot a drinking glass off her head with a gun. This incident is revisited in The Film of the Book of his work _Naked Lunch_.
-   This kind of trope was also done with guns, by Annie Oakley. There was a bit in her act where she would shoot the ash off her husband's cigar.
    -   At one point, Kaiser Wilhelm was in the audience. Annie's husband asked for volunteers, as he always did, and to his surprise the Kaiser stood up. Annie pulled off the trick, and after World War I started said she regretted not shooting a few inches further down the cigar. (She sent the Kaiser a letter asking for a second shot. To no one's surprise, he never sent a reply.)
-   Straddling the line between Real Life and folklore are the tales of American Mountain Man Mike Fink. Several stories tell of him and his friends shooting cups of whisky off each other's heads. One account of his death says that in 1829 in a drunken stupor, when aiming at a mug of beer from the head of his longtime friend, John Carpenter, he shot low; shortly thereafter, his other longtime friend, Talbot, retaliated by killing Fink, using Carpenter's pistol.
-   The designers of a the Wrist-Rocket slingshot did this using their dad as the person that was at risk for a commercial. It was never put in the ad because, after they shot the scene but before they televised it, they realized people might look at that and then try it at home. But that didn't stop one of the designers from later talking about the un-televised ad on television at a later time. Even better was that the slingshot was so powerful that the rock punched a clean hole right through the apple. Their father tilted his head to make it look like it had been knocked off.
-   While playing this with his brothers growing up, author James Thurber was shot in the eye with an arrow. He lost his sight in that eye and eventually became permanently blinded in the other eye.
-   In 1990s Latvia, a hapless (or gutsy) thief tried to steal fuel from a National Guard motor pool and ended up being subjected to an _epic_ Humiliation Conga. After he got caught, his punishment was to be tied to a post and have the bored Guardsmen try to shoot a plastic cup off his head with their AK rifles. By the time the police arrived, the would-be thief had soiled himself in terror several times over, not aware that the soldiers were firing blanks. The cops, not planning to allow such a filthy individual into their patrol car, drove off and let the guardsmen do whatever they wanted to him. So the thief was given an extra beating just for good measure before being cut loose. (It goes without saying that nobody ever tried to steal fuel from the National Guard again.)
