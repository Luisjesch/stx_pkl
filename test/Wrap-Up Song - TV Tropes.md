_So long, farewell, to you my friends._

_Goodbye for now, until we meet again._

Congratulations! You've just finished writing the first few episodes of your new television show. But probably because your demographic is young and wants things to be predictable, or that you want to be different from other shows, you decide to add a song to close out every episode.

In order to create a sense of unity between the creator and his audience, and/or between all the fans of the show, a song may be used as an Every Episode Ending. Often, the presenter will address the fun they had for that episode, but emphasize that now it's time to conclude the episode and say goodbye to everybody. As a spark of hope they'll be informed to tune in next week or the next day, depending on how frequently the show airs.

In most cases, an Wrap-Up Song is used at the end of children's programming; on occasion it is the final number in a piece intended for an older audience, usually variety shows (which is doubtless where this trope got its start). May double as — or occasionally be replaced by — a Solemn Ending Theme.

A sub-trope of Every Episode Ending.
