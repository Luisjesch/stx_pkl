_"What if you had a universal remote…that controlled your universe?"_

A form of Magic from Technology whereby a TV remote control works on reality itself. Somehow, the remote imbues its wielder with bonafide Reality Warper abilities, such as being able to control time with the pause, fast-forward, and rewind buttons, take away people's voices with mute, or even change the entire environment by "channel-hopping". Although, callous users may find out that Reality Warping Is Not a Toy.

Sister Trope to Rewriting Reality. See also Handy Remote Control, which is far more mundane.

    Advertising 

-   A couple of Pepsi commercials revolved around this trope.
    -   A Diet Pepsi commercial features a woman fast-forwarding through a musical on her TV, before hitting the "reverse" button, which drains her glass of Diet Pepsi. She uses the remote to refill her drink, then decides to flip channels on her cat, changing to a dog and finally a handsome man, who she proceeds to spend time with.
    -   Another Pepsi commercial features a boy watching Shakira perform on his TV. His sister calls him out, causing him to spill his Pepsi on the remote, which turns her into his mother who tells him to do his homework. The boy promptly changes channels on her, flipping to his father and then an old man dancing to the music, which he powers off. He then presses a button on the remote which zaps Shakira into his room, who proceeds to take his Pepsi and kiss him, then returns on the TV enjoying his drink. The old man suddenly reappears with the remote to the boy's surprise.
    -   Also utilized in a commercial featuring Kylie Minogue with a similar premise to the above Shakira commercial.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Invoked by Misaki Shokuhou in _A Certain Magical Index_. She frequently uses a remote control to control people's minds; however, the mind control power comes from her own body/mind, the remote control is only there because she likes the idea of using it that way.
-   _Doraemon_ has a remote-control shaped gadget (literally called the Universal Remote in some English translations) which allows the user to pause, rewind, or fast-forward their intended targets. It happens to be used in one manga issue that displays Nobita's jerkass moments, where Nobita asks for said remote with the excuse that he's rushing his homework and wants some extra time only to use it for playing pranks, including rewinding Suneo who's sketching near a park (cue a confused Suneo seeing the pencil drawing he spent an hour working on _undoing itself_), pausing Shizuka to peep at her changing and slowing down before beating up Gian after deliberately picking a fight with him. When Doraemon threatens to confiscate said remote, Nobita decides to just pause Doraemon instead, only for Doraemon to come prepared with a mirror - cue Nobita pausing himself, with a pissed-off Gian, Suneo and Shizuka approaching in the last panel.

    Comic Strips 

-   Subverted in one _Calvin and Hobbes_ daily, where Calvin turns off the TV with the remote and then, inspired, points it at his father and clicks.
    
    **Calvin:** _\[when his dad remains in place\]_ Rats.
    
-   One _Rose is Rose_ comic strip has Jimbo teasing Pasquale by pretending to be affected by the TV remote.
    
    \[press\]
    
    **Jimbo:** _\[walking backwards out of the room\]_ "Rewind" pressed and myself at control remote the pointed I if happen would what, Pasquale, hey?
    
-   _Vid Kid_ had this as its central premise. The titular character had a VHS remote that applied its effects to reality. For example, hitting the pause button would freeze a person on a block of ice, rewind and fast forward could allow for time travel, and eject could remove a memory from someone's mind. Of course, the effects would be different depending on the context, giving Vid Kid New Powers as the Plot Demands.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Click_ features Adam Sandler finding a universal remote at Bed, Bath, and Beyond that allows him to pause and fast-forward time, among other settings. The problem emerges when it turns out that it saves his preferences and starts acting on its own, deteriorating his relationship with his family and causing him to miss out on his entire life.
-   _Creepshow 3_: The plot of the first segment, "Alice", centers on the title character's father finding one of these. Whenever Alice's father presses one of the buttons on the device, the whole family except for Alice changes ethnicity (i.e., the "Color and Hue Settings" button makes her family turn African-American, and the "Subtitles" button makes her family turn Hispanic).
-   _Epic Movie (2007)_ has a parody of the _Click_ remote, which the characters use to win the battle of Narnia.
-   In _Funny Games_, the TV remote is used to literally rewind the film so that Paul can stop the protagonists from foiling his scheme.

    Literature 

-   The _Goosebumps_ short story "Click" is about a boy who comes across an advertisement for a "Universal Remote Control" sold by The Little Shop That Wasn't There Yesterday that works on reality itself. He quickly starts to abuse it for various petty reasons, like cheating on a school exam, which eventually alienates him from his best friend. At the end, he accidentally makes the world vanish when he presses the "OFF" button in frustration, only to find that the batteries have run out. This story was also adapted into an episode of _Goosebumps (1995)_.

    Live-Action TV

-   _Goosebumps (1995)_: The whole premise of "Click" is that Seth is given the Verona XG-20 Universal Remote Control, which gives him the powers of a Reality Warper. While he initially only uses it for mild pranks, he gradually becomes Drunk with Power when he realizes the full potential of the device.
-   _Round the Twist_ has an episode called "Spaghetti Pig-Out" based on the Paul Jennings story that features the remote that can control real life, although it lacks the "looking like green chocolate" attribute that it has in the book.

-   The late 1990s Finnish electronic song "Freestyler", from Bomfunk MC, has a music video revolving around a teenager traveling the subway who realizes that his MP3 player has powers over reality and can pause, rewind, or fast-forward people around him.

When Mr. Wilson refuses to reward the boys with cookies for helping him, they use the rewind function on him as payback, getting him in trouble with his wife. Later, they use the slow-motion and pause functions to help the police catch and arrest a pair of bank robbers. At the end of the episode, Mr. Wilson asks Dennis and PeeBee to use the fast-forward function on him one last time so he can put the wallpaper up again. PeeBee does so, but the Time Tuner breaks, leaving Mr. Wilson stuck in fast-forward.
