_"That body of light is the sign of a super-dimensional life-form. ... He eats dimensions for lunch!"_

For this type of being, sustenance goes well beyond organic matter—or any kind of matter, for that matter. More dangerous than a Horde of Alien Locusts and those who feed on blood, Life Energy, or even planets, what it eats does not even exist tangibly, for it feeds on _existence itself_. Such individuals often are Eldritch Abominations or display The Power of the Void.

See also Reality Warper, which is about controlling reality instead of eating it, Abstract Eater which is the super trope to this, and Clock Roaches which are guardians of causality that eliminate things that threaten it. The eaters' feeding habit may cause Ret-Gone.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _EDENS ZERO_: The Chronophage is an Eldritch Abomination that feasts on the time of planets, which reverts them to an earlier state depending on how much time is eaten, ranging from decades to millennia. This essentially overwrites a planet's present existence and history with its own past, creating a sort of pocket Alternate Timeline. What's more is that those who manage to escape the planet will not only avoid getting overwritten themselves, but also won't be affected by whatever changes may occur to their past selves, thus allowing two versions of the same people to co-exist free of any Temporal Paradoxes. Conversely, anyone left behind who wasn't there in the past will be erased from existence.

    Audio Plays 

-   _Big Finish Doctor Who_:
    -   The Neverpeople, who consume time, erasing people from existence and almost destroying the Web of Time. Then Zagreus, the personification of Anti-Time, who could destroy the Universe if released.
    -   "The Time Machine" has the Creevix, Insectoid Aliens who are the masters of time from the next universe along. They consume potential future and in an Alternate Timeline consumed the Universe after entering on 23 November 2013. With a massive Timey-Wimey Ball, the Eleventh Doctor influences his previous selves to stop their plan.

    Comic Books 

-   _The DCU_:
    -   In _Crisis on Infinite Earths_, the Anti-Monitor destroys and absorbs the energies of many universes to become stronger.
    -   _All-Star Superman_ has the Chronovore, a monster that eats time. When it feeds, the surrounding environment and creatures suffer Rapid Aging.
    -   Mister Mind from _Shazam!_ almost becomes this in _52_, bringing the 52 alternate universes in existence (their main differences being the parts of the respective realities which he "ate").
    -   _Final Crisis_ introduces Mandrakk the Dark Monitor, a normal Monitor corrupted into a vampiric being that feeds on the Bleed, the dimension between realities that separates and defines them.
-   _The Mighty Thor_: The Black Winter is a cosmic entity that does to entire universes what Galactus does to planets.
-   A motif in the latter half of _Seconds_ is that falling snow takes the appearance of consuming the fabric of the current reality.

    Fan Works 

-   _Black Queen, Red King_ has one in the form of Oblivion. Discord claims that Oblivion was created to consume all of reality itself.
-   In _King of Kings, Ruling over Rulers_, Ayavan is capable of consuming the timeline of living beings.
-   In the _Pony POV Series_, Makarov absorbs other beings, which causes them to be Ret-Gone'd. The author describes him as an "Existence Vampire".
-   In the Magical Girl Crisis Crossover _Shattered Skies: The Morning Lights_, Joker unleashes one of these upon the Precure universe. "The entity" consumes and ret-gones every Precure continuity after Go Princess, and manages to consume all possible futures from the remaining ten continuities before it's finally stopped. It leaves a catastrophic Time Crash in its wake.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _The NeverEnding Story_: The Nothing is consuming the land of Fantasia. If it isn't stopped, Fantasia will be destroyed.

    Literature 

-   _The Atrocity Archive_ has an infovore, an extrauniversal intelligence that feeds on quantum information, causing the Alternate Universe it was summoned into to gradually collapse.
-   In _City at the End of Time_ by Greg Bear, the Typhon manifests as this at the end of time, untold trillions of years in the future. The Typhon eats away at the _logic_ of the universe; within it, nothing makes sense, and the rules of nature no longer apply. The last city in existence, the Kalpa, only just barely holds the Typhon at bay with its reality generators, and they have slowly been failing.
-   The _Cthulhu Mythos_ story "The Space Eaters" by Frank Belknap Long begins with a conversation between the narrator and his friend on such Eldritch Abominations:
    
    _"Suppose there were a greater horror? Suppose evil things from some other universe should decide to invade this one? Suppose we couldn't see them? Suppose we couldn't feel them? Suppose they were of a color unknown on Earth, or rather, of an appearance that was without color?... What could we do? Our hands would be tied. You cannot oppose what you cannot see or feel. You cannot oppose the thousand-dimensional. Suppose they should eat their way to us through space!"_
    
-   In _Discworld_, the Things from the Dungeon Dimensions want to invade the Disc because their home is sorely lacking in reality. They believe invading the Disc and consuming its reality will make them more real, though it's stated to be as futile as the ocean trying to warm itself with a candle.
-   _The Langoliers_ has an airliner fly through a "time rip", landing at an airport with all its passengers but ten disappeared. The ten passengers, who were all sleeping during the passage through the rift, are all stuck in time such that time does not move forward (although they can move within that frame). Eventually, they see mysterious ball-like creatures with sharp gnashing teeth literally "eating" the surrounding existence itself, approaching them...
-   _Shakugan no Shana_: The Denizens of the Crimson World are monsters from another world who consume the "power of existence" of humans. If they eat your power of existence, you're Ret-Gone'd from reality. Interestingly, the majority of the cast are such monsters, and a significant number of them try to find a way to get around their morally indefensible diet. They eventually find a way, thanks to Snake-Yuuji.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_: In "The Time Monster", the Master attempts to control a powerful being called Kronos, whom the Doctor refers to as a Chronovore, or time-eater.
-   _Loki (2021)_: Alioth is an enormous beast that consumes anything that is sent to the void at the end of time. He Who Remains originally used it to win the multiversal war by having it eat all of the other timelines.

    Multiple Media 

-   _Transformers_: While Unicron _appears_ to be a "mere" Planet Eater, he actually feeds off of existence itself in his bid to eliminate all of reality and be truly alone. In every continuity, he's the same individual, at some different point in his existence. Some universes he devours, others are saved from him, and he's shunted to the next one to begin the cycle anew. According to the Transtech Cybertronians, Unicron has successfully terminated 1,176,325 universes so far (out of 15,962,782 catalogued by them). He actually managed to devour all of creation at one point, but it was re-created while he slept. He was rather annoyed when he woke up and realized he'd have to do it all over again.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Mage: The Awakening_: The Abyss as a whole constantly gnaws at reality, for it is anti-reality made manifest, a realm of contradiction, paradox and negation opposed to existence as we know it.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
    -   The Eldrazi titans were exactly this before being trapped in a physical form on the plane of Zendikar by three powerful planeswalkers. Now they simply nom Zendikar from the inside, turning everything they meet to dust.
    -   While each variety of atog has its own diet, the chronatog is the most bizarre and is described as feeding on time... somehow. In the card game this is represented by the player skipping his next turn.
-   _Planescape_: The entrope is an artificial lifeform created by the doomguard, a powerful philisophical faction in the setting which believes in the inevitability of death and decay. It possesses the capacity to consume planar barriers, the results of which can be very dangerous due to the majority of such organisms being located in the Inner Planes.

    Video Games 

-   In _Blue Planet_, overheard thoughts of Sufficiently Advanced Aliens reference something they call an "ontovore". The word's etymology suggests that it refers to something which consumes existence. They also refer to the same thing as an "acatalepsis event". Not a whole lot is known about it, and it's implied that even thinking about the subject is dangerous to one's mental health.
-   _Chrono Cross_ has the Time Devourer, the main antagonist of the game and the fusion of Lavos and Schala from the previous game.
-   _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_: Alduin the World-Eater, whose raison d'etre is to devour the universe at the end of time to make way for the next world. In the current one, according to some theories, he jumped the gun: it wasn't time for the world to end, which was why first the Tongues, then the Dragonborn were able to defeat him. He also seems less interested in destroying the universe and more interested in _ruling_ it.
-   Neo-Exdeath from _Final Fantasy V_ declares its intent to consume all memories, dimensions, and existence, so that it too will disappear, forever.
-   _Grey Goo (2015)_ has The Silence. Little is known about it, but it's capable of consuming literally everything it touches and leaving behind nothing but darkness. That black mass of empty space in the sky at night where there's a gap in the stars? That's The Silence. It eats light, sound, and, well, pretty much everything.
-   _League of Legends_ has the non-canon "Dark Star" skins for several champions that are built off this concept, turning them into Cosmic Entities who annihilate and feast off entire galaxies at a time. The line is codified by Dark Star Thresh, an Anthropomorphic Personification of a black hole who believes time is a cog in a dying machine, and is already responsible for the cessation of multiple _realities_ by the time he hits Runeterra.
-   The Maelstrom, a force of pure chaos and destruction itself, from _LEGO Universe_.
-   _Marathon Infinity_ has W'rkncacnter, who as soon as it escapes from its prison in the sun screws with reality just by existing, and _then_ it starts eating.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_ has two:
    -   From _Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)_, there's the god of time and light Solaris, who plans to devour all of existence.
    -   _Sonic Generations_ has the Time Eater, a creature that eats holes in space and time and throws Sonic into places he's been to before (including one that he has visited before, but also technically didn't and probably shouldn't be able to return to). It turns out that it's an Energy Being that Eggman and his past self turned into a cyborg-mech-abomination.
-   The Greater Scope Villains of _Star Control Origins_ are beings only referred to as the Gluttonous Eyes. They are extra-universal entities that somehow consume _information_ and spread chaos in their wake. How exactly someone is supposed to fight or resist such entities is unclear:
    
    **Captain:** Maybe there's something else we could feed these things?  
    **Xraki:** har/joke/har. you plan plot/scheme/trap. plot/scheme/trap is also order/information. gluttonous eyes feed/consume
    
-   Superboss Culex from _Super Mario RPG_ claims to be this, in his Badass Boast.
    
    _"I am matter... I am antimatter... I can see your past... I can see your future... I consume time... And I will consume you!"_
    
-   In the last level of _Tasty Planet_, the Grey Goo eats "Time Itself". When even this is eaten and there's absolutely nothing left, the Grey Goo implodes and become the next Big Bang.
