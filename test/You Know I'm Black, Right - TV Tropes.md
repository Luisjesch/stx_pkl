_"Then they'll say some stupid shit like, 'Oh, Karen, I didn't notice you're black.' Don't say that to black people. We're really codependent, and we're worried about your blind ass."_

— **Karen Williams**

When a character says or does something racist, sexist or homophobic in front of the Token Minority, Token Girl, or Ambiguously Gay person, either because they're an Innocent Bigot or because they said something easily Mistaken for Racist. Usually, the character will respond with a caustic one-liner like "I'm Standing Right Here".

This can be played for laughs with a Token White. Otherwise, it usually pops up in the Very Special Episode, after which the characters go back to totally ignoring the issue.

Usually, this would be more offensive than You Are a Credit to Your Race, although this will of course depend on the personalities involved.

The logical conclusion of You Know What They Say About X.... See also Insult Friendly Fire for this sans racial components, and Forgot the Disability for a similar variant regarding disabled characters.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   A Fantastic Racism example in the 2008 special _Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!_; upon seeing Tarble's alien wife Gure, the Muten Roshi comments that "Saiyans pick strange wives", which understandably ticks off Bulma and Chi-Chi, the two Earthling wives of the main (Saiyan) characters.
-   Elma and Fafnir team up at one point in _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_ to take on an army of brainwashed Order and Chaos Dragons. Fafnir declares his intention to kill all of the Order dragons present, which Elma obviously takes offense to. He then amends his statement to wanting to kill half of them.

    Comic Books 

-   _Astro City_: A boisterous, money-grubbing comic publisher did _not_ know that the supervillain Glowworm was black before depicting him as a white supremacist in a Jack-in-the-Box story. The results were not pretty.
-   He doesn't say anything actually racist, but early in _A God Somewhere_ a white guy is helping his Token Black Friend move to a new place. He opens the box he's been carrying to see a multitude of Black History books inside. Puzzled, he asks his friend why the friend has so many of these books and why he reads them. The friend just _looks_ at him and after a moment the white guy is going "Oh, right..." then tries to explain that he sometimes forgets his friend is black. That doesn't exactly fly either.
-   An inversion in _Magneto: Testament_. The protagonist's sister says that the people where she works think she is German. Her father responds with a tired: "You _are_ German, Ruthie."
-   In _New X-Men_, Rockslide taunts Anole, who's gay, by calling him a "big sissy". Anole immediately opens up a can of whoopass on him, which is kind of impressive considering Rockslide is twice his size and made out of lava, and Anole is more like a human artichoke. As it happens, Rockslide didn't know and was just being his usual insensitive self, but Anole's not interested in excuses.
-   When Prospero is introduced in _PS238_, Kevin "Emerald Gauntlet" Kramer says he must be an invader because he's an alien. Ron "Captain Clarinet" Peterson, son of the setting's Superman Substitute, takes offence, and also points out aliens gave Kevin's dad his gauntlet (he's the Green Lantern expy). Kevin's response is "You just don't know anything about aliens."
-   In _Quantum and Woody_ issue #4, Quantum is repeatedly called "noogie" (a substitute for the n-word) several times by a homeless street-dweller. Quantum, whose costume covers his entire face and body, asks the guy how he knows he's black. "You're **black?** S-Word!"
-   In the _Secret Wars (2015)_ Police Procedural tie-in _Thors_, Rune Thor makes a rude comment about "muties" and their unwillingness to cooperate with the police, prompting Storm to remind him that "You know you're standing right next to a mutie, right?" Giving the line to the only black character in the comic makes the subtext even more obvious.
-   Image Comic's dark vigilante Shadowhawk fights an Evil Counterpart named Hawk's Shadow, a white supremacist who targeted criminals, thinking that Shadowhawk is doing the same (in Hawk's Shadow's mind, "non-white" is the same as "criminal"). This led to The Reveal, where Shadowhawk takes off his cowl for the first time, revealing that he is black.
-   _Spider-Man Family #9_: Jean Grey of the X-Men gives a speech about how people treat mutants, people always assuming the worst and treating you like a freak and running scared at the slightest provocation...then realises she's talking to Spidey and Bruce Banner. "Oop" indeed.
-   Downplayed in DC Comics' _Steel_: Natasha Irons says to her white friend, "Boris, in case you haven't noticed, I'm black", before realizing that he's just such a ditz it honestly hasn't occurred to him there's an unfortunate association in giving her a watermelon<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  as a gift.

    Comic Strips 

-   _The Boondocks_: Jazmine is biracial and doesn't identify with one specific racial identity. When she meets Huey (who is black) he instantly pins her as black. But when she meets Cindy (who is white), Cindy doesn't notice she's half-black until Jazmine mentions it after being uncomfortable with Cindy's patronizing talk. Cindy pinned her as "just a little tan, like Mariah Carey."
-   In one _The Far Side_ panel, an elephant is in a bar getting ready to fight a guy while his friend holds him back and says, "Relax, Jerry! He probably didn't know you were an elephant when he told that last joke."

    Fan Works 

-   In _Chaldea Daily Life_, Lancer Artoria decries the French are a superstitious and cowardly lot that will strike first in the French-British War. Both the Saber and Beserker Lancelot decide it's not the best time to bring up that they're French.
-   In chapter 39 of _Crimson and Noire_, when Wayzz scolds Trixx for protesting against his partner Fu using the Turtle Miraculous and that he's acting like a human child, Trixx snark that Wayzz acts like a boring old human. Fu tells them to stop arguing and reminds Trixx that he and Marianne are "boring" old humans themselves.
-   In _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_'s version of _Dragon Ball: Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans_, titled _Plan to Eradicate Christmas_, Ghost Freeza calls the Saiyan protagonists "monkeys", which his comrade Ghost Turles, a Saiyan himself, objects to.
-   In _The Empress Returns_, Sister Ruth expresses distrust of the psyker Angelique, saying that there is too much that can go wrong with a psyker's power and that she would operate better without her. Twilight Sparkle (whom the Sisters all but worship as the Empress' Chosen Student, not to mention a bit more stable than Angelique), points out that she herself is a psyker, to which Ruth quickly backtracks that psykers are great before hiding her face with embarrassment.
-   _Heroes of the New World_; during a war meeting of the Whitebeard Pirates, Izou loudly declares that all oni are a vicious, inhuman, brutal race that bring nothing but trouble (referring to Yamato seeking to join the crew). He is briefly stalled when Namur, a Fishman, snarls that he never thought he'd hear similar racist remarks to what he's faced in the past aboard Whitebeard's ship, leaving Izou to weakly defend himself before Whitebeard tells him to shut up and drop his prejudices fast.
-   _the holy or the broken_: Taking place in 2002, Enrico Pucci reaches out to Giorno Giovanni to help complete his father DIO's plan to reach Heaven and wipe out the Joestar bloodline from existence (which Giorno notes include ten-years-old Jolyne Cujoh). But when Giorno lists the Joestars that would be killed, he adds that Pucci forgot one: 16-years-old Giorno Giovanni<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , which he declares before killing Pucci with a venomous snake and destroying the bone of DIO needed for the Heaven Plan.
-   Played for Drama in _RWBY: Scars_ when a flashback shows Neo (who is a reptile Faunus) asking her father Roman why he refers to Faunus (including his deceased wife Eon) as "animals". Roman replies that he's gotten used to saying the term when mad, but he'll try to stop using it.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist_ fanfic _Son of the Desert_, Havoc, Breda and Fuery make racist complaints about Ishvalans being religious nuts which angers Edward and Alphonse Elric who are both half-Ishvalan and atheist.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Epic (2013)_, Nod and Ronin's mockery of the "Stomper" (MK's scientist father) and the revelation that they've been misleading him for years doesn't go over well with MK. When she points out that she was a Stomper as well, there's a bit of awkwardness.
-   This exchange from _The Simpsons Movie_:
    
    **Mayor Quimby:** I hereby declare a state of emergency: CODE BLACK!  
    **Lenny:** Black?! That's the worst color there is! _\[to Carl\]_ No offense there, Carl.  
    **Carl:** _\[not even shaken\]_ Nah, I get it all the time.
    
-   In _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_, Spider-Gwen calls Kingpin a pig in response to the fact he's hosting a charity gala in the name of a man he killed. Spider-Ham immediately glares at her and reminds her "I'm _right_ here."

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _All About E_: Johnny, E's employer, insults Arabs to her face with a variety of slurs. She stares at him incredulously (as he also views her as his best employee)-it's soon revealed she's herself of Lebanese Arab ancestry. Johnny doesn't know, or perhaps care it seems.
-   In the film _The Jerk_, Navin Johnson (Steve Martin) is courted by various groups courting his financial backing after he strikes it rich. One group wants him to invest in a housing development, explaining that they intend to keep _certain people_ out—when Navin doesn't get it, they just say it outright: "the niggers." They're unaware that Navin was actually raised by a black family (and oblivious to his own whiteness for decades), so he retorts "Sir, you are talking to a nigger!" and kicks their asses with sudden martial arts skills—all except Iron Balls McGinty, that is.
-   _A Knight's Tale_: At one point in the film, Roland remarks "Women, eh?" to Kate. She is not at all amused and scowls at him before he realizes what he just said.
-   In _The Luck of the Irish_, Kyle's Love Interest Bonnie tries to inspire him by talking about his Irish roots, pointing out how Irish immigrants would often get low-income jobs because no one wanted to hire them. Cue Kyle's Token Black Friend interrupting her by pointing out that, at least, _they_ got paid. Bonnie shuts up.
-   In _Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves_ Duncan goes off on a rant about the Moors, then off-handedly asks Azeem what kind of name "Azeem" is. When Azeem replies, "Moorish", Duncan is shocked (since Duncan is blind, he didn't know Azeem's ethnicity before that) and slightly terrified (since this film is set during one of the Crusades, there is a Holy War going on between their cultures).
-   In _Southland Tales_, African-Americans actor Boxer Santaros tags along with LAPD police officer Taverner when the latter openly admits to him that the police are only out for the blacks. Santaros is taken aback and removes his sunglasses as if to say "dude, I am black too". Subverted when it turns out that Taverner was only joking.
-   At the beginning of _Stand by Me_, Chris, Teddy, and Gordie are sitting in their tree-house, playing cards, when Chris decides to tell a joke.
    
    **Chris:** How do you know if a Frenchman has been in your back yard?  
    **Teddy:** Hey, I'm French, okay?  
    **Chris:** Your garbage cans are empty and your dog's pregnant.  
    _\[Chris and Gordie laugh\]_  
    **Teddy:** Didn't I just say I was French?
    
-   _Tropic Thunder_: Inverted. Kirk Lazarus is a white Australian playing a black man, and has to be constantly reminded by the actual black man Alpa Chino that he is not, in fact, black.
    
    **Kirk:** _\[to Tugg\]_ What do you mean, _you people_?  
    **Alpa:** _\[to Kirk\]_ What do **you** mean, _you people_?  
    **Kirk:** _\[still to Tugg\]_ Huh!?
    
-   _White Hunter, Black Heart_: John Wilson (a No Celebrities Were Harmed version of John Huston) and Pete Verrill are having dinner with Mrs. MacGregor, who starts making remarks about the Jewish people who were in London in WWII. Verrill immediately tells MacGregor he's Jewish, but she doesn't believe him and continues making her remarks. Wilson gets back at her by telling a story about a similar woman he had known during the war, who had also made anti-Semitic remarks at a dinner gathering, until he shut her up by calling her "the ugliest bitch I've ever dined with".<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Wilson starts to say the same thing to MacGregor, but figures she's gotten the point.

    Jokes 

-   A racist white woman in the Deep South calls up the local army base and invites them to send some soldiers to her house for Thanksgiving. "But no Jews" she adds. Come Thanksgiving, she opens the door to find a group of black soldiers. "There must be some mistake" she says. "No ma'am," says one of the soldiers. "Sergeant Greenberg never makes mistakes."

    Literature 

-   In _The Babysitters Club_ series, this happens in the first chapters of several books as an attempt to introduce the characters to new readers. Some of the forgotten attributes are forgivable, such as the girls momentarily forgetting that Stacey is diabetic, but others are completely baffling, such as somehow _forgetting that Jessi is black_.
-   In the second _Night Huntress_ book, _One Foot in the Grave_, Cat gets really pissed about her team's racism against vampires without remembering that she is half-vampire herself.
-   In _Robots and Empire_, after D.G. Baley makes an Auroran warship retreat, he notes what cowards Spacers are. Of course, he speaks to Gladia at the time. Fortunately, she limits herself to sarcastically agreeing with the captain to his embarrassment.
-   In _X-Wing: Solo Command_, there's a bit after Tal'Dira tries to assassinate Wedge where Wedge goes to Nawara Ven and asks him if the phrase "one-leg-hopping maniac" (something Tal'Dira had said about Wedge during the incident, a mangling of his Manchurian Agent trigger phrase) has any significance in Twi'lek culture. Nawara says, "You're asking _me?_" and gestures to the prosthetic leg that took him out of the cockpit permanently back in _The Bacta War_.
    
    **Wedge:** Sorry. And yes, I am asking you.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   In an episode of _3rd Rock from the Sun_, Dick has this happen to him multiple times in the same few minutes, so, in order to prevent it from happening to him again, he puts a sticky note on his secretary reading 'Nina is Black'. It was actually a running gag that the Solomons literally could not tell the difference, and eventually seemed to conclude the difference was entirely cultural. In one episode, Sally had to compare the color of the skin on her own arm to Nina's to remember if another person was black or not.
-   One episode of _All in the Family_ has Archie invited to speak at a funeral of a co-worker who he, being the kind of guy he is, had been making anti-Semitic jokes in front of for _years_. It isn't until the funeral itself that Archie learns the guy is Jewish. Clearly the guy was too polite to ever mention it, found the jokes rather funny, or both. Still, Archie is at a loss for words.
-   In _Angel_, Cordelia calls Willow, who has broken up with her boyfriend and acquired a girlfriend in Cordy's absence, to ask her about her old friend Harmony's irritating behavior.
    
    **Cordelia:** _\[on the phone\]_ Oh! Harmony's a _vampire_! ...All this time I thought she'd become a great big lesbo! _\[Beat\]_ Oh. Really? ...well, that's great! Good for you!  
    **Willow:** _\[dryly\]_ Thanks for the affirmation.
    
    -   During an episode of the parent series, _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, while trapped in a musical, the cast is forced to sing what they think is going on in "I've Got A Theory," Xander muses that it could be witches. Cue glares from Willow and Tara. He follows up with:
    
    **Xander:** _\[Beat\]_ Which is ridiculous 'cause witches they were persecuted, Wicca good and love the Earth and woman power and I'll be over here.
    
-   Similarly, Jake in _Becker_:
    
    "I'm a blind black man, we just **sail** through life."
    
-   A literal and funny version on _Blind Justice_, when Jim (white and blind) jokingly claims that he was unaware of his (black) co-worker Tom's race.
    
    **Tom:** I'm just a well-rounded brother from East Flatbush.  
    **Jim:** You're black?  
    **Tom:** _\[in disbelief\]_ Get the...  
    **Jim:** No, are you serious? You're a black man?  
    **Tom:** Jim! You didn't know?  
    **Jim:** No. How would I... _\[gestures to his eyes\]_  
    **Tom:** You just thought you was working with Eminem for the last four months? How could you...  
    **Jim:** No, I just...  
    **Tom:** How could you not _feel_ my blackness?  
    **Jim:** I thought you were just kinda... groovy.  
    **Tom:** _\[Beat\]_ Groovy?
    
-   In an episode of _Boardwalk Empire_, Nucky is discussing his plan to rig the election and his ally Chalky White responds negatively to his saying "We'll have spooks vote" until it's clarified he meant literal dead people, as "spook" was also a racial slur at the time.
-   From _Community_ a few members of the study group (and Chang) are riffing on a bad movie. The (relatively) Troubled Sympathetic Bigot Pierce tries to do so too, but his horribly racist and sexist attempts somehow fall flat.
    
    **Pierce:** "Directed by Kim Yang." Asian. Can't drive, can't direct.  
    **Chang:** Dude, I'm right here.
    
    -   Another example occurs when Britta declares "I can excuse racism, but I draw the line at animal cruelty!" only for Shirley to immediately reply "You can excuse racism?"
-   On one of Judge Miliani's cases in _Court TV_, the plaintiff informed the judge that the defendants were — _ugh_ — lawyers! ...It turns out, so are all judges.
-   Somewhat parodied in a deleted scene of _Criminal Minds_, in which the line was not actually meant to be racist, but is jokingly taken that way. When Reid (white) tricks Morgan (black) into losing at Gin on the plane, he gloats, "When are you people going to learn never to play cards with a magician?" Morgan replies, "What do you mean 'you people'?"
-   Once on _The Daily Show_, Aasif Mandvi interviewed a community leader who made anti-Muslim comments to his face. At one point he casually said, "You do know that I'm a Muslim, right?"
-   Invoked in the series version of _Dear White People_: when Sam White does her Malcolm Xerox radio show on how a friend of hers, Reggie, was immediately held at bay with a gun by campus police after they were called to a party where he was involved in a fight with someone, somebody calls her up and disagrees with her stance that it was unprovoked. She immediately accuses the caller of just being blind to the reality of what happened thanks to his "white privilege"... only for the caller to dryly inform her that he's an African-American.
-   _Degrassi: The Next Generation_:
    -   "Pride, part 1": When Paige asks Spinner to carry her beach bag, which happens to be floral patterned, he tells her that he can't, because it make people will mistake him for a "homo". Spinner then realizes it was a mistake to say that in front of Paige's brother, Dylan, who is gay:
        
        **Spinner:** I didn't mean "homo" as in "gay", I mean "homo" as in...  
        **Dylan:** ...Milk?
        
    -   Later, Jimmy catches Spinner writing "_Marco is Gay_" on a wall in the boy's bathroom, and says, "What are you going to write next? ...Something about me being black?"
-   In _Downton Abbey_, the Granthams host the wedding ceremony for their cousins' daughter, who is marrying a Jewish man. One of the guests (one of the Crawley family's Yorkshire neighbours) commends them for "putting on a brave face" in front of such ghastly race-mixing. Lady Grantham reminds her that her father was Jewish (her maiden surname is the extraordinarily Jewish "Levinson") and she is completely at ease with her Jewish heritage; the guest slinks off, mortified.
-   In the Puppy episode of _Ellen_ Ellen discusses coming out to her therapist, who is played by Oprah Winfrey:
    
    **Ellen:** You don't understand. Do you think I want to be discriminated against? Do you think I want people calling me names to my face?  
    **Therapist:** Have people commit hate crimes against you because you're not like them.  
    **Ellen:** Thank you.  
    **Therapist:** Have to use separate bathrooms and separate water fountains and sit on the back of the bus.  
    **Ellen:** Oh man, we have to use separate water fountains?
    
-   One episode of _The George Lopez Show_ featured a racist scout leader for Max. During a discussion of how one can tell how different marks on an animal show whether they're aggressive, the scout leader compares it to how a cute blonde would be less suspicious than a Mexican. George responds by reminding him that _he's_ Mexican.
    
    **Scout leader:** I mean, yeah, but I mean, well, not _you guys._ I mean those "me no speake" Mexicans.
    
-   The British TV biopic _Hughie Green: Most Sincerely_ has a scene, possibly taken from real life, in which Green and his producer are holding an audition for Green's TV talent show. Green is enthusiastic about one candidate, but his producer says, "You know he's black, don't you?" Green rejects this racist attitude out of hand and passes the candidate over his producer's objections.
-   In an episode of _The Jeffersons_, George seriously has to save face after making stupid "zebra" jokes about his in-laws to a wealthy prospective client, one who is _also_ one of two inter-racial spouses. (Of course, simply apologizing is something George can't make himself do, so he makes the situation _far_ worse in his attempts to make better.)
-   In a variation, one episode of _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_ involving a white supremacist group has Munch being the one to find anti-Semitic literature in the group's headquarters. Given the nature of the group, though, they really don't care, and one of them even insults Munch to his face after realizing he's Jewish, although it turns out she's an undercover officer just playing up the part to ingratiate herself to the real ones.
-   In one episode of _M\*A\*S\*H_, Major Winchester is upset to learn that his sister is engaged to an Italian. Father Mulcahy tries to make light of the situation, but then Winchester comments, "At least she isn't marrying an Irishman." Mulcahy simply grabs his lunch and storms off without saying another word. In the same episode, he makes a derogative remark about "dark-skinned olive pickers" in front of Lebanese-American Klinger. Unsurprisingly, Klinger is not amused.
    
    **Winchester:** How would you feel if your sister was marrying a swarthy, dark-haired olive picker?  
    **Klinger:** She did. And for your information, Major, so did my mother and my grandmother not to mention the future Mrs. Max Klinger, whoever she is!
    
-   In _Picnic at Hanging Rock_, there's a non-verbal example. Irma makes an off-hand remark about "savages" while the four girls are walking through the woods, leading Marion, who in this adaptation is half Aboriginal Australian, to turn around and give her a long, pointed look.
-   On _Psych_, there have been a few moments where Gus has to point out to Shawn that he's black, including the Civil War reenactment episode and the time Shawn asked him to investigate a tanning salon.
-   In _Queer as Folk (UK)_, Nathan moans that his best friend wouldn't understand what he's going through because she's straight; she snaps, "I'm black. And I'm a girl. Try that for a week."
-   In the fourth season of _RuPaul's Drag Race_, Jiggly Caliente talked about how she's completely turned off by the idea of dating another Drag Queen, which offended Sharon Needles because at the time she was _in_ a long-term relationship with another queen (Alaska Thunderfuck).
-   In a Very Special Episode of _Smart Guy_, Yvette and her friend Nina get jobs at a small store in the mall, where Nina is given the following job:
    
    **Nina:** It is my happy task to follow black people around the store to make sure they don't steal.  
    **Yvette:** You know this is going to affect our friendship.
    
-   A variation happens on _Sports Night_ the first-season episode "The Apology". Dan is forced by the network brass to apologize on-air for remarks he made in a magazine interview calling for de-criminalizing drugs. In defending his position, Dan compares himself to Rosa Parks sitting in the front of the bus, but eventually agrees to do the apology. When the network brass leaves, Isaac, his boss, who's African-American, has this to say to Dan:
    
    **Isaac:** You know I love you, don't you?  
    **Dan:** Yeah.  
    **Isaac:** And it's because I love you that I can say this: no rich, young, white guy ever got anywhere with me comparing himself to Rosa Parks. Got it?  
    **Dan:** Yes, sir.  
    **Isaac:** Good.
    
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_: Inverted in "Take Me Out to the Holosuite". The Vulcan-supremacist Captain Solok makes a broad generalization about the inferiority of human emotions, without regard for several cast members in the scene who are not, in fact, human.
    
    **Ezri Dax:** Did I forget to wear my spots today?  
    **Quark:** All that intelligence and he _still_ doesn't know what a human looks like!
    
-   Generally averted in _Supernatural_, despite multiple opportunities for it. Dean frequently bashes angels in front of Castiel, who never complains or tries to argue with him about it. Demons, on the other hand, will sometimes get testy if the heroes make disparaging remarks about demons in front of them, even though the entire demonic race is pretty much pure evil.
-   _Timeless_: The group's token black guy points out in the very first episode that there is literally no time period in American history that's safe for him.
-   _Welcome to Sweden_: Bruce disses Swedes and Sweden to Malin Åkerman (she's a potential client). She then tells him _she_'s Swedish in annoyance, before making clear he won't get her business.
-   The episode of _Yes, Dear_ where Jimmy became a housemate on _Big Brother_ might qualify here. Although nothing offensive was said, when Jimmy asks the resident black, gay housemate his opinion on the attractiveness of a female housemate, he responds with "You know I'm gay, right?". Jimmy attempts to correct himself and restart the conversation by making a remark about one of the men's abs instead.
    
    **Black, Gay Guy:** _(in confessional)_ That's what I like about Jimmy. He didn't even seem to care that I'm gay... or notice... Tomorrow I'm gonna tell him that I'm black!
    

    Theater 

-   In _Hamilton_, the title character gripes to George Washington that Virginians are all alike (in that they're self-interested hypocrites). Washington sternly points out that he _himself_ is a Virginian, so watch it.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Video Games 

-   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, if a non-City Elf meets Bann Vaughan Kendels in the prison, it's possible for him to explain his attitude toward City Elves by basically saying Elves aren't people. He will say so even if the Warden _is_ an Elf and/or if Zevran, the team's elf, is present. Considering he is at this point trying to convince you to free him, this doubles as Too Dumb to Live.
    -   Big Bad Loghain and The Dragon Ser Cauthrien can also both admonish the Warden for putting a stop to Loghain's slave-trading in the Denerim Alienage even if the Warden is an elf—especially a City Elf from the Denerim Alienage. What possessed them to think that explaining the benefits of selling elves into slavery would work on an elf (especially one born and raised with family and friends in the affected alienage) is anybody's guess.
-   Can happen in _Dragon Age II_ as well if you're playing a mage Hawke and you choose the right set of responses when talking to Cullen after a quest. He'll say that "mages aren't people like you and me," even if you're wearing obvious robes, carrying a staff, and _he's seen you casting spells in front of him during an earlier fight_. What's even funnier is that Hawke (yes, even Mage-Hawke) can agree with him. In front of your mage party members.
    
    **Anders**: ...Why do you do this right in front of me?
    
-   The trend continues with _Dragon Age: Inquisition,_ where Boomerang Bigot Sera badmouths elves (especially those of the Dalish culture) every chance she gets, even if you're playing a Dalish Elf who's romancing her. Yes, she's aware that you're Dalish. No, she's not concerned with how offended you may be.
    -   If you bring Cassandra (a devout human Andrastian) to the Temple of Mythal, and choose to honor the ancient elvhen rituals, she will disdainfully ask "why are we wasting our time with this heathen nonsense?" even if you're playing a Dalish Elf, and even if you've made it clear before that you follow the elven religion.
    -   Mother Giselle, while very kind, accepting, and open-minded, is a Chantry cleric, so every bit of advice and encouragement she has centers around Chantry teachings and faith. It's a little awkward for non-human Inquisitors, though a Dalish Inquisitor in particular can repeatedly point out, "You know I worship the elven gods, right?"
    -   Commander Cullen's opinion of mages has improved from his previous appearances, but he occasionally makes some harsh statements about the dangers of too many mages running around unsupervised. A mage Inquisitor can angrily remind Cullen that everything he said also applies to them.
    -   Happens with Iron Bull if the player is a Qunari. When you first recruit him and ask him about the Qun, he at first dismisses you as Tal-Vashoth but the player can point out that their parents were the ones who chose to leave the Qun, they're still judged by their appearance and are asking someone who can empathize with them. Bull then takes back what he says and admit the player (and their parents) doesn't act like any of the hostile Tal-Vashoth he's met.
-   This can happen in _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_ as a side effect of Welcome to Corneria. In the Fantastically Segregated city of Windhelm, NPCs are known to mutter about "damn Dark Elves" and "damn Argonians", even if the Dovahkiin happens to be one. Borders on Too Dumb to Live if a player is trigger-happy.
-   In _Final Fantasy X_, Wakka makes several bigoted remarks about the Al Bhed in front of Rikku (Al Bhed) and Yuna (half Al Bhed, though he doesn't know it at first). The rest of the party lets it slide at first, but they, particularly Rikku and Tidus, start calling him on it later.
-   Played with in _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_, where CJ has been working with Wu Zi, a Triad leader who tried hiding the fact that he's blind but fails spectacularly. When CJ responds to Woozie's big reveal by saying "(long pause) NO SHIT!", he then asks if Woozie knows he's black, quoting the trope title verbatim. The Triad's response? "I'm blind, Carl, not stupid."
-   _Mass Effect 2_:
    
    **Shepard:** You? I said a badass, not some scout whining like a quarian with a tummyache.  
    **Tali:** I'm Standing Right Here!
    
-   In _Sam & Max: Freelance Police Season 2 Episode 1_, Bosco makes a comment that paranoia is 'what separates us from the animals'. Sam looks offended and caustically responds that the saying 'plays better with the non-dog-and-rabbit crowd'.
-   _Star Wars: The Old Republic_:
    -   An alien (any species except human, cyborg, or Sith Pureblood) protagonist, regardless of class, can invoke this at least once. Especially alien Imperials, given the Empire's Fantastic Racism to non-humans and most Imperial characters' tendency to forget this fact when talking to you. Also an alien Smuggler when explaining why they're siding with the Republic against the Empire, given how the Empire tends to enslave anyone that looks like you.
    -   An alien Sith Inquisitor gets it from _two_ angles: on top of the previous example, the Inquisitor's Backstory is that they're a slave who was freed and sent to Korriban's Sith Academy when they were found to be Force-sensitive. You often find yourself reminding Imperial slavers that they're talking to a former slave, such as an army officer investigating why some of the slaves in an uprising on Dromund Kaas have started killing other slaves—they turn out to be a homegrown cult that aspires to become Sith.
        
        **Inquisitor:** _(to the skeptical officer)_ A slave _can_ become Sith. Never forget that.
        
    -   The Sith Warrior's companion Vette does some of this, too: she was a slave as a child, escaped, and was captured and re-enslaved by the Sith when she was caught graverobbing on Korriban (the PC has several opportunities to remove her shock collar and free her). As a consequence she tends not to take kindly to voicing support for slavery or cruelty to slaves.
    -   In the flashpoint "A Traitor Among the Chiss", Aristocra Saganu explains that Chiss consider Force-users to be "impure, contaminated," in reference to one that Chiss aristocrat Zenta is sheltering. A Force-sensitive PC will sarcastically remark, "You know how to make me feel welcome."

    Web Animation 

-   Episode 11 of _Arby 'n' the Chief_ found the Arbiter playing _Grand Theft Auto IV_ online with some friends, when they were joined by an irritating, obviously white suburban kid pretending to be a tough black gangbanger. Upon yelling "Don't hate da playa, hate da game, honkies!", one of the Arbiter's friends responds "Uh, FYI I'm actually black", which causes the kid to say "Oh...really?"
-   In _Red vs. Blue_, the Blue team sees someone wearing pink armour in the Red base. They gush over there being a girl over there, and how unfair it is that they didn't have one, only for Tex to cut in with:
    
    "You do realize that I'm a chick, right? And that I'm standing right here?"
    

    Webcomics 

-   _8-Bit Theater_ likewise combines this with Fantastic Racism when Red Mage, in the process of explaining one of his needlessly complex and stupid plans, is interrupted by Black Mage, while standing right next to Thief:
    
    **Black Mage:** Let me stop you right there before I am honor-bound to cut you like an elven whore.  
    **Thief:** Hold on. _Elven whore?_ Do I even have to explain why that's offensive to me?  
    **Black Mage:** Look, if your mother had made dresses, I would have called her a tailor instead.
    
-   _Anecdote of Error_: While in detention for breaking the vase in the museum and trying to stop an Alemi soldier by themselves, Shimei flips out and says this is what happens when housekeepers are allowed to play with magic. (Never mind that it was at least partly her fault as well.) When Luntsha, who is a housekeeper, hears her say this, she replies, “I’m sorry, WHAT?!” Then Shimei goes on a classist tirade. Ironically, Shimei is the setting’s equivalent of black.
-   _Bram & Vlad_: In the Meeting arc, Summer gets in trouble when she says that vampire hunters with vampire heritage are disgusting near _Blade_.
-   Minmax in _Goblins_ accidently offends Kin at one point, by using the term "monster" derogatively towards Dellyn while forgetting that Kin is a Yuan-Ti.
-   In _Loserz_, when Carrie comments to Alice that her friend Jess coming out of the closet is disturbing, Alice responds with something similar to this trope.
    
    **Carrie:** Doesn't that freak you out? Isn't that totally gross?  
    **Alice:** Let Me Get This Straight.... You're asking one of the only black girls at this school if she should be repulsed by somebody because she's different?
    
-   Parodied in _Rob and Elliot_. Elliot makes a joke about a "dumb guy," prompting Rob to blow up in his face: "My mother was dumb! I'm half dumb!"

    **Landon:** _Barkeep!_ My friend isn't drunk enough to agree with me yet!
    
-   A _Shortpacked!_ strip has a character express disdain that Bumblebee cannot talk in the Transformers Film Series or _Transformers: Prime_... within earshot of a mute woman. The look on her face tells him how inappropriate that was.
-   In this _Something\*Positive_ strip, a white male Pagan ran across a Davan-created webcomic taking a potshot at Wicca and works himself into a righteous anger over the "persecution":
    
    **Pagan:** You'll never know what its like to live with the pain of your ancestors being oppressed for who they were! That they lived in fear because they might get lynched! To know that the suffered so I'd have the right to —  
    _\[Beat Panel with African-American Wiccan Kim staring at him\]_  
    **Kim:** Do you need some time to comprehend why saying that to me makes you stupid?  
    **Pagan:** ...No, I think I've got that figured out.
    
    -   Inverted in another: Aubrey is reprimanding one of her employees, who accuses her of being prejudiced against white people. Aubrey points out that she's half-white (the other half is Asian).

    Web Original 

-   _Prolecto_ plays this for laughs, when Vivian complains about being judged by her skin color. In this case, being blue. The black officer in front of her coughs.

    Web Videos 

-   Happened in _Game Grumps_, though it wasn't the minority in question who actually used the trope. From _Nickelodeon Guts #3_:
    
    **Jon:** I'm sorry I offended anybody with Down's syndrome, I am apt to do these things. Offend people. Barry, put in something else, like "Jew"!  
    **Arin:** Please edit that, Barry, the only Jew of all of us!

    **Lana:** _Racist_? I'm black—  
    **Malory:** Oh, put it back in the deck.
    
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: Toph's friends (especially Sokka) have a tendency to forget that she's blind, since her Disability Superpower is such that it doesn't slow her down much. This tends to lead to many of Toph's great one-liners.
    
    **Sokka:** Toph, when I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like.  
    _\[Sokka holds up a "Wanted!" Poster of Toph\]_  
    **Toph:** Well, it _sounds_ like a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what's _on_ the sheet of paper.
    
    **Katara:** What is the meaning of this!?  
    _\[Katara holds up the same "Wanted!" Poster\]_  
    **Toph:** I don't know! Seriously, what is with you people!? I'M BLIND!!
    
    **Toph:** _\[on the group's plans to visit the Spirit Library\]_ I say you guys go ahead without me.  
    **Katara:** You got something against Libraries?  
    **Toph:** I've held books before... And, I gotta tell you, they _don't_ exactly "do it" for me.  
    **Katara:** Oh, right. Sorry.
    
    **Sokka:** It's so dark down here! I can't see a thing!  
    **Toph:** Oh, no! What a nightmare!

Cue the Bailiff immediately objecting.
-   _Danny Phantom_ has this:
    
    **Danny:** How can I trust her \[Paulina\]? She's a girl, girls can't keep secrets! _\[Danny notices Sam looking at him crossly\]_ Uh, except for you, you're...different.

-   In the _Steven Universe_ episode "Rocknaldo," Ronaldo maintains that his inflammatory pamphlet about "Rock People" isn't specifically targeted at the Crystal Gems because, unlike the Gems, Rock People have gems in their bodies, can pull forth weapons and are capable of shapeshifting.

-   In the _Superman: The Animated Series_ episode "Knight Time", when Superman teams up with Robin in order to find out what happened to Bruce Wayne, they discover that he may be under an alien mind-control.
