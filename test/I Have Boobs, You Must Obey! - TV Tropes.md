Obey the hypno boobies!

_"It's a level eighty female-only persuasion spell. We try not to over-use it."_

How do you get something you want from another person? Logical arguments, diplomacy, trading, bribery, force, or — if you are a woman trying to persuade a man — the mere fact of having tatas. And due to Buxom Beauty Standard, the bigger, the more effective it is.

Yes, because writers think All Men Are Perverts, women don't even need to _pretend_ that getting sex is a likelihood or even a possibility. All they have to do is possess secondary sexual characteristics to get men to do their bidding. We mean, They're Men, They Can't Help It, right?

Manipulative seduction, of course, _can_ happen in real life, but is rarely (if ever) this straightforward. This is another one that fell somewhat out of favor by The New '10s, except when it's Played for Laughs, which is where it works best. At one point a common gag was to have a woman try this on a male character who would turn out to be gay, but this version is becoming a Forgotten Trope in recent times.

For related tropes, see any number of similar story beats about women showing off to cause stuff to happen: Distracted by the Sexy, Favors for the Sexy, Honey Trap, Lysistrata Gambit, Screw the Rules, I'm Beautiful!, Sexposition, Show Some Leg. For more forceful and violent methods of using one's breasts to persuade people see Torpedo Tits. See Lust Makes You Dumb for characters who are likely to fall for this.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Assassination Classroom_: Early on, Nagisa lists "breasts" as one of Koro-sensei's weaknesses after noticing the latter ogling Irina Jelavic, a Femme Fatale assassin sent by the government to kill him. This is later exploited during a game of cops and robbers when the students bribe Koro-sensei with a racy photograph to let them out of "prison", and again on Valentine's Day when Kaede gives him a picture of Aguri Yukimura in a bikini as a distraction.
-   In _Ben-To_, Sen Yarizui uses this on both Hana and You to get them to join the Half-Priced Food Lovers club.
-   _Bleach_: Rangiku Matsumoto's not above using her appeal to help her get what she wants, such as the time she tried to convince Ichigo to let her sleep at his house by unbuttoning her already partially undone blouse. Aside from the occasional reference (usually comedic, but sometimes insulting) in the manga and its related omakes, the anime takes this much further and has a field day using Matsumoto's chest as actual weapons to help her manipulate men (usually Hisagi).
-   Faye Valentine in _Cowboy Bebop_ hints that this may be the reason behind her iconic outfit.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Bulma tries to invoke this occasionally. It seldom does much good: Yamcha is too bibbledy over her to be useful, Vegeta is too much of a Jerkass, and though Goku will usually help her out, it's because his Grandpa taught him to be nice to women, not because he is particularly attracted to them.
    -   One subversion in the original _Dragon Ball_ actually involves Bulma offering a lot more than a peek to General Blue, who is consequently _horrified_ by the prospect, hinting his tastes run... elsewhere.
    -   The only time this tactic has worked for Bulma is when she has to cajole Master Roshi into giving up a dragon ball. Due to forces unexpected, she ends up giving the Turtle Hermit a bit more than she thought she did...

-   One episode of _Golden Boy_ has a busty blonde as an office boss.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_: Urumi often uses her feminine charms to get her way, like when she pretended to seduce Onizuka when they first met, or when she teased her tutor by offering him her panties if he could solve an impossible math problem.
-   Ukraine tells Russia to 'show them your breasts!' in a flashback _Hetalia: Axis Powers_. However, Ukraine has boobs that even have their own sound effect, while Russia's a dude. In the same scene, there's a Funny Background Event: little Belarus, listening to Ukraine's speech and making snow boobs.
-   In episode nine of _Kamen no Maid Guy_ Naeka infiltrates a cake shop for her friends to find out why the place is so successful. It turns out it has nothing to with the food because it's terrible. It's just that their mostly male customers are completely enamored with the waitresses all of whom have large breasts.
-   Basically the central conceit of _Manyu Hikencho_: in this manga's version of medieval Japan, a bigger bust confers wealth and social status for the woman possessing it. The Manyu Ninja clan exists to manipulate this society for the shogunate's benefit by deflating the breasts of enemies of the state to get them outcast.
-   Naruto, despite being _male_, tried to use this on Killer B via shapeshifting. It doesn't work, since B Likes Older Women. It worked on Jiraiya, though.
-   Momoko Kibitsu from _Ōkami-san_ and her "kibidango" that she uses to control her three fanboys (and Urashima) in a very tongue-in-cheek reference to the legend of Momotarō.
-   Invoked and lampshaded in _Otaku no Musume-san_. The author even goes so far as to put in a sidebar note "Are huge breasts truly righteous!?"
-   The H-anime _Private Psycho Lesson_ tells the story of a hypnotherapist who uses her ample chest to hypnotize her patients.
-   Suggested in the Beach Episode of _Rahxephon_. Ayato's drawing ability becomes known, Cathy McMahon subtly rubs one of her breasts in Ayato face, 'suggesting' that he pick her as his next subject.
-   _Ranma ½_: What do you get when you take one protagonist that's a Manipulative Bastard with a Heart of Gold and make him a Genderbender? That's right. This trope.
-   _Rosario + Vampire_: Kurumu Kurono may be a succubus who has the power to charm men into loving and obeying her, but having breasts big enough to suffocate the main character only makes it easier.
-   _Symphogear_: When pulling an I Surrender, Suckers on Hibiki, Vanessa makes sure to emphasize her very generous chest (which somehow seems to be soft despite being _made of metal_). Hibiki is _extremely_ flustered by this, giving Vanessa an opening when she opens up her jacket and reveals that she has missiles built into her bust.
-   Chapter 3 of _Torako, Anmari Kowashicha Dame da yo_ has Enma getting roped into promising to show off her boobs to any boys who help her defeat Torako. It works, as she has a small army ready to take on Torako. However, when Torako sees them, and sees that Enma is clearly embarrassed by the whole thing, she swings a _steel beam_ at the boys and politely tells them they shouldn't bully. The boys immediately fold, declaring Enma's bra size isn't worth risking their lives for, and not even Enma throwing her bra off on the spot will persuade them to return.
-   The drug dealers in _The Voynich Hotel_ try this when under fire from an assassin by holding up a paper saying “we’ll show you our tits if you let us go”. It fails, with the assassin somewhat apologetically saying he’s gay.
-   _You're Under Arrest!_ had one chapter about a topless mugger who used her breasts to distract targets before tasing them. "She" turned out to be a man wearing a harness with fake breasts attached to it that were rigged to shock anyone who touched him. The girls took him down with a bodysuit that had guns hidden in the breasts.

    Comic Books 

-   _Asterix_: The series provides a non-boobs example: Cleopatra may be an angry witch, destroying vases and sentencing people to death for petty reasons, but who will dare argue with her? She has such a pretty nose!
-   _Batman_: To get access to a corpse, Tim Drake had to dress as a female med student in a costume apparently created by Alfred. When Tim complains about the bust being too big<small>◊</small>:
    
    **Alfred:** I made them big enough that you would get preferential treatment, but not so big that you'd be remembered.
    
-   _Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash_: Bree is fairly proud of getting Ash to buy her a lot of stuff with his employee discount just by walking up to him in a low-cut shirt.
    
    **Bree:** When you've got tits like mine you only have to tease— boys'll do just about anything if they think they might get a taste.
    
-   _Knights of the Dinner Table_.This is Bridget Keating's standard tactic. It notably doesn't work when she runs up against a security guard she had dissed the year before, and who remembers her only too well.
-   _Lady Death_: In the "Unholy Ruin" story, Lady Death's ally Hanax is placed under a spell that turns him against her. When her own magic fails to free him she resorts to showing him her breasts. It doesn't work either as the magic is too strong.
-   _Power Girl_: Power Girl (the Most Common Superpower incarnate) tried to use this a time or two with varying levels of success. Lampshaded in _Superman/Batman_ "Nevermind arc" when Superman, while he is trapped in Power Girl's body, gets information from a hotel manager.
    
    **Superman:** I wish all my interrogations went so easily.  
    **Batman:** It appears that there are more effective techniques than a rubber hose...
    
-   _The Ultimates_: During a fight with the Hulk, The Wasp had to distract the Hulk. So, she just undid her top and showed her boobs in all their glory.
    
    **Nick Fury:** A double PHD and all you could think of to distract the Hulk was the Mardi Gras special!?!?
    
-   _X-Men_: Emma Frost has admitted to dressing in Stripperiffic outfits to throw people off guard and better manipulate them. In issue #10 of _Marauders 2019_, she and Pyro are confronted by guards while sneaking around a Russian ship. Emma partially flashes her breasts at the guards and then uses her Telepathy to make them shoot each other.
-   _Young Avengers_: Lampshaded by Kate Bishop and her Kree boyfriend Noh-Varr:
    
    **Noh-Varr:** Have I mentioned I have mind control saliva?  
    **Hawkeye:** It's okay. Many parts of my body are mind control.  
    **Noh-Varr:** This is true.
    
-   _Young Justice_: The first villain the team ever fought literally had this trope as her superpower. After she had retrieved a Super-Cycle from an archaeological dig, mousy but slightly hot Nina Dowd was transformed into the voluptuous Mighty Endowed. ME's power was the ability to shine, er... headlight-type beams from her newly ample bosom, hypnotizing all men who saw them. The responses from the guys were hilarious. For the record, she was defeated when her newly gigundus breasts caused her to lose her balance and fall flat on her face, blocking her powers. In a later appearance, she literally had to have a pair of male minions help her stand.

-   Attempted but not successful in _Bordello of Blood_.
    
    **Rafe:** I'm not going to tell you those aren't the Breasts of the Century, but I'm just not digging the owner, so why don't you put those away - you're just not my type.
    
-   In _The Cannonball Run_ a pair of jumpsuited beauties in a Lamborghini use this to evade speeding tickets. It ends up backfiring on them when they try it on a cop who, as they soon discover, has her own impressive assets in this area.
-   In _Change of Habit_, Barbara convinces some men to help her move furniture into her apartment by walking down the street in a short dress slipped off her shoulder.

    **Angelique:** _\[rips her suit off\]_ With THIS!

-   In _The Heat_ Mullins invokes this when Ashburn is trying to seduce a mobster, telling Ashburn to "use your boobs!" Ashburn shoves the man's face into her cleavage. At least it worked.
-   In _Jennifer's Body_, Megan Fox's character uses this to get drinks despite being underage. She later cites this trope almost by name to her best friend, telling her breasts are like smart bombs: you point them in the right direction and the magic happens.
-   During the rescue sequence of _The Living Daylights_, Bond gets a little help from this trope; his Big Beautiful Woman helper on the east side of the Berlin Wall distracts a guard by unveiling her assets. When last seen, the distracted party is planted face-first in them while the defector escapes.

-   _Munich_: This is a distinctly unfunny aversion. A female assassin kills a member of the Israeli team, and when they come for revenge, she exposes her breasts to them and tries to bargain. They shoot her dead right where she stands.
-   In _Star Trek: First Contact_ and in later appearances in the television series, the Borg Queen seems to be consciously applying this trope. The Borg are extremely unsexy cyborgs, yet for some reason her (entirely mechanical) body has a decent pair of "nodes" and is designed so that her head and torso (the only parts of her that are organic) fit into it so that it looks like a rubber bodysuit with a low-cut neckline. Needless to say, her behavior is flirtatious and her technique for trying to subvert Data is outright seduction.
-   _Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines_: Subverted. The TX is speeding in a stolen convertible and a police officer stops her. She spots a big Victoria Secret billboard with a model wearing a wonderbra and inflates her bust size before the cop walks up next to her. It works and the cop is momentarily distracted by her cleavage, but instead of using it to get away with speeding, she kills him for his gun.
-   In _Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets_ in the climax of the movie Valerian, the main hero and a soldier has to choose between surrendering the MineralMacGuffin to someone who really needs it and right then or asking the OneWorldOrder first and wait for new orders. Laurelin, his love interest, clearly spells out that while Valerian got the ultimate choice, he'll blew every possible chance to pursue his romance with her if he chooses wrong as he'd prove himself "unable to know what love is". Valerian takes the most honorable choice, but to finally hook up with Laurelin.
-   In _Vlog_, Brooke conducts an experiment to see if she can snare a man solely through the power of cleavage alone. She succeeds, commenting that she could stay in the restroom for 20 minutes and Brandon will still be waiting when she comes out.

-   _White Chicks_: "Oh, Honey, you are so barking up the wrong tree right now."

As Harry comments, "He didn't stand a chance".

-   _Siren Novels_: In _Undercurrent_, Vanessa asks an EMT about the latest siren murder, which he isn't supposed to talk about. Because of her siren beauty, he happily tells her everything he knows, which isn't much.
-   In _Warbreaker_, Blushweaver - the goddess of lust and honesty - shamelessly employs her divine mammaries to manipulate her fellow gods.
-   In _The World Inside_, Aurea tries this on Siegmund to get him to keep her and her husband from being forced to move to the newest urbmon, even though she knows it is unlikely to succeed in a society where anyone is generally anyone else's for the asking, sexually.
    
    She approaches him, pulls her shoulders back, unsubtly lets her nipples come thrusting through her garment of mesh. Hopeless. How can she magic him with two pink nubs of stiff flesh?

    -   Subverted in another episode. In an effort to reduce Mary's parking ticket fines, Officer Don has her assigned to a judge who is easily influenced by cleavage.

Double subverted in The Tag when the same judge offers to reduce the fines and eliminate the contempt charge if she spends the weekend with him at a hotel. Mary turns him down on the basis of his choice of hotel.

    -   One episode begins with the cast discussing who's going to say what about Joey's new show without hurting his feelings (they pass around the Damned by Faint Praise standbys like "the lighting was good."). Phoebe doesn't have to say a word — she just presses him against her chest. His response? "... It wasn't _that_ good." It later turns into a Brick Joke when his show gets canceled. As Joey is completely distraught, he asks "It was a good show! Right!?" Then _both_ Rachel and Phoebe press him against their chests simultaneously.
    -   In "The One With All the Football," Rachel, Monica and Phoebe have to figure out some way to defeat the guys in a football game.

-   _Kröd Mändoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire_: Aneka easily gets things from men (even enemy soldiers) by having sex with them, though much of this just seems like an excuse (since she does it _a lot_).

    -   Unusually for this trope Mazikeen is quite willing to use it on the ladies as well.
        
        **Chloe:** How did you get in here? _(the police station)_  
        **Maze:** Let's just say Samantha at the front desk is no longer into men.
        
-   In a Halloween-themed edition of _Mike & Molly_, Victoria Flynn follows the science-fiction theme her family adopt for costumes by making herself up as Eccentrica Gallumbits, the Triple-Breasted Whore of Eroticon Six with the addition of a prosthetic third breast. She uses this as her own Trick to disperse some over-age and yobbish trick-or treaters, by flashing all three breasts at them. zipping up her top after making her point, she declares
    
    If I had four of these, I could rule the world!
    
-   Played quite literally in _Misfits_ where one girl has hypnotic tits. That isn't a figure of speech, her (involuntary) power is to cause men to stare at her breasts and then do whatever she tells them to.
-   Haley on _Modern Family_ prepares to bring this trope into play when she needs to obtain the last of a very popular toy as a Christmas present and it has just been grabbed by a man. As she adjusts her cleavage and makes her approach, she overhears the man on his cellphone and realizes that he is a Camp Gay. Foiled, she has to find another way to get the toy away from him. Jay also uses this to land a big deal with a difficult customer. He has Gloria present from a brochure about his products, while holding it strategically positioned beneath her breasts which are showcased by a low-cut top. The client is absolutely mesmerized.
-   The _My Parents Are Aliens_ episode 'Fangs For The Mammaries' has Sophie develop this mentality and use her shape-shifting powers to enhance herself to space-hopper proportions. It works perfectly on the male cast apart from Josh.
    
    **Brian:** I want to say 'no' and yet your nicky-knacky-noras make me powerless to disagree!
    
    **Sophie:** See? It gets them every time!
    
-   On _New Girl_, Cece tries to use this on Schmidt (explicitly to lure him into sex when he insists he needs to work). He manages to resist, pulling a gender-swapped Lysistrata Gambit, in part because he's upset she was bragging earlier about having all the control in their relationship.
-   In _The Office_, Jan gets Michael to rekindle their relationship by getting implants. Michael had no desire to get back together with her until she showed him the goods. Michael maintained that it was not shallow but "emotionally magnificent".

-   In the first episode of _Outlaw_, Lucinda (Carly Pope) tells Eddie that she's going to get the construction plans she needs from a government office by flashing her breasts.

-   A Season 5 episode of _Reno 911!_ saw the female deputies assigned allegedly bulletproof vests that are styled far more like sexy bustier corsets, accentuating their cleavage. Deputies Williams and Weigel use their "assets' to non-violently subdue recidivist meth fiend "Big Mike" (who is wildly swinging a samuari sword), mesmerizing him and luring him into a waiting police car. They even "put 'em on the glass" for good measure.
    
    **Deputy Williams:** Hey! Get your ass in the car!
    
-   Elliot and Jordan on _Scrubs_ both do this fairly frequently. Although Elliot would use this on J.D., at times she had some ethical dilemma because she didn't want to build a reputation on her sex appeal (with others telling her it is okay because as a female doctor she got the short end of the stick anyway). Jordan, not being a doctor or even a real working woman, has no qualms about that. At one point, Elliot believes that her breasts have miraculous healing powers that enable her to cure sick patients by showing them off.
-   _Seinfeld_:
    -   In the episode "The Gum", Elaine does it by accident; a button falls off from her blouse, resulting her showing a great amount of cleavage, but she doesn't notice it, until she easily convinces a policeman to tell a florist to disconnect a hose he was washing the sidewalk with.
    -   In another episode, while meeting with an NBC executive, George is caught looking at his teenage daughter's cleavage, so the executive turns down their idea for a show. To get revenge George and Jerry make Elaine basically shove her cleavage in the executive's face, thus causing him to reconsider the show.
-   On _Spartacus: Blood and Sand_, especially in the case of Roman women such as Ilithyia and Lucretia, you can tell a woman wants something based on her showcasing them while making her request or demand. Averted with slaves however, as they are often forced to go topless by default, making it a case of their masters and mistresses saying "You have boobs and _you_ must obey".
-   Averted in the _Stargate Atlantis_ episode "Trio", when McKay, Keller and Carter are trapped underground, and McKay suggests that Carter should offer a glimpse of her breasts to motivate a group of boys to help them. Carter, appalled and incredulous, refuses. Keller just ignores him.
-   _Star Trek: Enterprise_ revealed that the entire Orion race basically works this way.
-   Donna in _That '70s Show_ works this one out and subsequently manages to convince guys of things by just showing her bra strap. She also lampshades this one with a downward look:

-   _Will & Grace_: Karen Walker tries to do this to a cop (Vince) when pulled over for reckless driving by making them talk to him in baby voices. It doesn't work.

    -   Straight: On the premiere episode of _Shotgun Saturday Night_, January 4, 1997, Goldust (w/Marlena) faced The Sultan (Rikishi) (w/Mr. Bob Backlund). At one point, the Sultan had Goldust trapped in the Camel Clutch. Marlena got up on the apron and, with her back to the camera, lowered the top of her dress (though she was wearing a paste-on bra), causing Backlund to freak out and attempt to cover the Sultan's eyes. Goldust ultimately won by countout, and Marlena was jokingly announced as the "winner."
    -   Averted. Crossed with Real Life Writes the Plot: Under her own name, she was the manager for the Radicals (Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn) in early 2001. Saturn had faced Mike Bell on the May 12 (taped May 7), 2001 episode of _Jakked_ in a match where Saturn got dropped on his head and retaliated by stiffing the heck out of Bell, leading to him being Put on a Bus for a few weeks. On the May 21 episode of _Raw_, Terri entered the APA's office and attempted to distract them by pouring their beer on her white shirt. Later, the APA faced Saturn and Malenko (w/Terri, who had changed to a robe) in a match where, as Saturn's punishment for stiffing Bell, the APA beat the heck out of him, with Bradshaw No Selling Terri flashing him. This led to Saturn's gimmick of saying goofy things that always ended with him saying "You're welcome!" and carrying around a mop he called "Moppy."
-   Miss Jackie Gayda. She flashed Rob Conway, with her back to the camera, during the Rico\-Rob Conway (w/Rene Dupree) match on the January 26, 2004 _Raw_, leading to Rico winning the match.

    Visual Novels 

-   While Maya Fey of _Ace Attorney_ is reasonably small-breasted, her (dead) sister Mia has a much larger bosom. On one occasion Maya channels her to fill out a waitress outfit that Maya was wearing, thus convincing an older witness with a maid fetish to give them information. Mia is not pleased about her role in the ploy. It's also used in one of the short oekaki comics in the Case Files manga, where Maya channels Mia in order to get the waiter to give her another serving of pork... And in case 3 of the first game when a kid (a witness) will not cooperate with Phoenix, but will do whatever Mia tells him to.
    -   April May, a witness in the second case of the first game, deliberately invokes this. She dresses in revealing clothing, and one of her sprites has her deliberately bouncing her chest to draw attention to it. It works so well that when she appears in court, Phoenix has to remind the judge that there's supposed to be a cross-examination after she testifies. Once the cross-examination actually gets underway, however, she flips out after Phoenix pokes one hole too many in her flimsy story. None of the characters appear the least bit interested in her sex appeal after that.

Then she takes photos of Makoto groping her boobs, sends them to Sekai and uses them to force Sekai to break things off.

    Webcomics 

-   In an _Easy Skankin_ guest comic crossover with _Ansem Retort_, Dingy tries to invoke this on Duke to get him to do a guest comic for her. He points out that her boobs violate the Geneva Convention, and also that, if he did this, she would have to admit that she was lazier than a sprite comic artist. She relented.
-   In _Casey and Andy_, time-traveling Jenn gives this as the reason why the younger Casey and Andy have to agree to help her time-travel back home.

    -   Hell, Satan explains what finishing touches she put on woman come Creation.
-   Sometimes used by Lilah in _Ctrl+Alt+Del_ to make Ethan do things. These were used to instantly cure him of his addiction to _Everquest_; an addiction that otherwise took _at least two weeks_ of therapy to cure.
    -   Ethan claims to have learned from this, and later attempts to use his penis to create this effect on Lilah. This does not work at all.
-   Daisy from _Daisy Is Dead_ tries to do this, but it only worked when she was still alive. Being a zombie complicates things.
-   Defied in _Dominic Deegan_:
    
    **Barkeep:** Very nice, Melna, but you still have to pay for those beers.
    
-   _Enjuhneer_: Penny tries it out on Julian here, but is mortified that it actually caused him to put a petty concern of hers above his finals. Kali later makes uses of Lyta's boobs to open doors.
-   _Far Out There_: Technically, Layla doesn't _flaunt_ her boobs (usually), but she most definitely has them, and the boys absolutely obey.
-   Jamie of _Girls with Slingshots_ is a Big Beautiful Woman and curvy all over. The curves she's rocking up front are especially powerful, and she knows it.
    -   She routinely relies on her busty charm for favors, and doesn't take any money to buy drinks at a bar because "That's what boys are for". This backfires when she's at a gay bar: Jamie is shocked that her "powers" don't work.
        
        **Hazel:** ...Your breasts aren't currency here!  
        **Jamie:** Powers... weakening...
        
    -   It's so second-nature to her that when an extra-cold winter forces her to stash the cleavage, she doesn't understand why everything becomes more expensive and less convenient. She's rather taken aback to discover that even her closest friends have been swayed by it.
        
        **Jamie:** You've been giving me _boob discounts_?!
        
    -   Jamie later explains that she's not joking when she says her boobs are magical. She really does have magically enchanted breasts. So do all the women in her family, ever since her ancestor received a Gypsy Curse from a kind Gypsy who ensured she'd be Cursed with Awesome. Jamie teaches her sister that their well-endowed family's magic must be wielded responsibly.
-   _Grrl Power_'s Dabbler, being a succubus, has literally hypnotic breasts, which she uses to troll straight girls and titillate anybody with any attraction to females. Sydney's plan for defeating Vehemence requires distracting him with Dabbler's jiggling jubblies.

-   _Misfile_: Ash, being an involuntary Gender Bender, is understandably reluctant to exploit her rather ample chest in this way, leading bewildered flat-chested Missi to fantasize about what she would do if she had Ash's "assets".
-   Jade's sister, Miranda, in _Pv P_ does it to virtually anything male. It only has about a 50% success rate. Brent tries to resist it (and usually does), Cole has too much business ethics, Reggie is blind, and Max is (at the time closeted) gay. It works perfectly on Francis and Jason and most passers-by. Miranda typically counters this with a rapid fire approach.
-   _Orneryboy_: Dirtygirl is losing a video game session, but finds a way to distract Orneryboy and turn the tables on him.
-   This is a life strategy of Julia Greenhilt from _The Order of the Stick_. When she tries this on Durkon ("Don't you want to pay attention to the girl with the boobs?") and he doesn't react, she decides he's gay _and_ catatonic. He later (off-screen) subjects her to a talk about respecting her body.

    **Bay:** "Man, I hate having to resort to this."
    
-   _Schlock Mercenary's_ Edward Bunnigus has this as part and parcel of her "exotic dancer" gene package. However, her bundled hyper-intelligence package enables her to _weaponize_ it. Overreacting Airport Security beware.
-   Intentionally parodied by Robin DeSanto in _Shortpacked!_ who wants to use her body to influence people, only she just can't figure out _how_.
    -   It's mainly because she's trying to seduce a gay guy.

-   Sahira of _Spinnerette_ jokingly refers to this as "Wonder Twin powers." Spinnerette treats it as an actual superpower on par with her own abilities, though Sahira's more relaxed about it.
-   Inversion in _Yet Another Fantasy Gamer Comic_, where Wolf's status as having the best ass in the Underdark allows him to sleep his way up the ranks — he's a male Drow in the female-dominated world of the Dark Elves.

    **Tink:** She means get more out.

    -   She attempts it (and fails) in another episode, trying to get something out of some CIA agents. Lowering the straps of her dress doesn't work, giving him her panties (taken off right in front of him) doesn't work, but the second she mentions her brownies his partner charges over in a Humongous Mecha and takes them. "He makes it hard to negotiate," the first scientist remarks.
-   During an early episode of _Family Guy_, Peter recalls trying to get out of a speeding ticket by pulling his shirt up to expose his man-boob. It doesn't work.

-   _Frisky Dingo_: Sinn with her disguise as "Hooper" is appointed the new leader of the Xtacles, they rebrand themselves the "Decepticals" and have a statue of "Hooper" they worship. Awesome X immediately deduces they appointed "Hooper" for "his" tits, though he admits they are awesome and is disappointed when a cheer is broken up.
-   _Regular Show_ inverts and uses this trope in a strange manner. Muscle Man ends up shirtless during his date with Starla at the skating rink. He flexes his pecs in such rapid succession that they begin to glow. Any female that looks at them becomes entranced.
-   _Robot Chicken_:
    -   The sketch "The Lion, the Witch and the Locker", a parody of _The Chronicles of Narnia_. The RC-nerd wound up in Narnia and the White Witch asked him to help her to defeat the talking lion, Aslan (referred to "an allegory for Jesus" and "the Jesus-allegory-lion").

Eventually, everyone's so determined to make her their friend that they devolve into cavemen and begin fighting each other. Bebe chooses to defy this trope, and eventually the boys learn how to do so too. This is shown when Wendy walks in after getting breast implants and the boys just laugh at the ridiculous size.
-   Used in an episode of _Stroker and Hoop_ where a henchwoman had the ability to hypnotize people regardless of gender by getting them to stare at her breasts. She also swirls them around, like a hypno-spiral.
-   Invoked accidentally by Heather in _Total Drama_ when she tries to cut Harold's tether during the water-ski challenge, but her shirt got swagged off a nearby tree branch leaving her topless. Harold, who got a full sight at Heather's boobs during the incident, becomes distracted and crashes into a rock losing the challenge. He spends the rest of the episode in a trance uttering the word "boobies".
