_"I wouldn't say a word that could be reckoned as injurious,  
But to find a mother younger than her son is very curious."_

When you subtract the age (or apparent age) of a child from that of their parent (mother or father, despite the trope name), this results.

Often done to justify a Mrs. Robinson or Stacy's Mom, but sometimes, the mother in question _really was that young_ when she gave birth. Sometimes she only appears this way because of the art style.

In Real Life, a girl can conceive about two weeks before her first menstrual cycle, which commonly occurs (on average) at around 11 or 12 years old these days (although carrying a child to term before physical maturity is risky and has a higher chance of Death by Childbirth; Henry VII's mother was thirteen when she gave birth to him and couldn't get pregnant again because of the damage to her reproductive organs) and in rare cases this can occur at an even younger age, such as _five years old_.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

Faked parentage

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_: At one point when the Principal and homeroom teacher come for a visit in the Ryouzanpaku dojo, Miu forces Sakaki and Shigure to pose as her parents. While Sakaki does look within the age range despite being in his early thirties, the Principal quickly notes that Shigure looks way too young to be Miu's mother (she's 20-21 at the start of the story, and Miu is 16), on top of neither of them having any physical resemblance to her.

    Fan Fiction 

-   _RainbowDoubleDash's Lunaverse:_ In a non-cannon fic, a pony called Midnight claims she is the sister of a foal called Thesis, who was brought to life via magical mishap. Thesis is too young and naive to notice the logical inconsistencies, even when she considers Trixie and Twilight her mothers. The other foals of Ponyville, meanwhile, do catch on to some of the inconsistencies there, but since Thesis knows how she was created, this just convinces the kids their parents were lying about the whole "stork" business.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Tracy Jordan's adult son on _30 Rock_ is far too old. In an aversion, Tracy sees through the deception immediately (while his friends assume the Cloudcuckoolander was actually taken in).
-   Discussed in the _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ episode "T.R.A.C.K.S", when Agents Coulson and Simmons are posing as father/daughter family. Simmons comments that Coulson is "far too young to have a daughter my age." (Though it would seem she's just being polite: the official website states that Coulson was 49 and Simmons 26 at the time the mission took place, meaning that they could easily be father and daughter at their respective ages.)
-   _Good Luck Charlie_: One episode has Gabe trick his elderly teacher into believing that his teenaged siblings PJ and Teddy (in thinly veiled disguises) are his parents. It almost works.
-   In the _Only Fools and Horses_ "And the Unlucky Winner Is...", Del wins a family holiday for the Trotters by entering a children's art contest with a picture painted by Rodney when he was 14. In order for them to be eligible to claim the prize, Rodney (who's in his early 20s) has to pose as a 14-year-old boy, with Del (who was 16-17 when Rodney was born) pretending to be his father. Del at least has the sense to claim Cassandra, about the same age as Rodney, as a stepmother.
-   In the _Our Miss Brooks_ episode "The Wrong Mrs. Boynton", Miss Brooks unwittingly offers to masquerade as Mr. Boynton's mother. This is in spite of the fact she is actually a couple of years younger than her Love Interest. It Makes Sense in Context.
-   In _Rome_, Niobe gives birth and successfully (for a while) passes it off as her daughter's child- her daughter is thirteen. (Romans often had children that young).

    Western Animation 

-   In _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ season 3, Sokka and Katara fake being Aang's parents at a Fire Nation school. The two of them are barely older than he is and wear unconvincing disguises (Sokka wore a fake beard, Katara wore a pillow stuffed under her shirt to make her look pregnant) to pass themselves off. To really blow some heads, just remember that in terms of pure chronological age, he could be their great-great-grandfather, and somehow, Aang could pass himself off as a Miniature Senior Citizen when entering Omashu.

Writers Cannot Do Math

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Cardcaptor Sakura_: It is never stated how old Syaoran's mother Yelan is, only that she looks very young and beautiful enough to stand out in a universe _populated_ by The Beautiful Elite. She is, however, _thought_ to be somewhere in her mid-to-late 30s, and possibly married as a teenager. This is never confirmed because she is only seen in the first movie.
-   Justified in _Dragon Ball Super: Broly_, where Bulma intends to use the dragon balls to make herself five years younger and Goku guesses she's probably done this a few times before.

    Comic Books 

-   _Kill Killer_ features a story with a "Dirty Callahan"-like killer of pedophiles who, after a lengthy period in prison for beating the supposed killer of his five-year-old child, reunites with his partner, the mother of the child... a 19-year-old teenager. Someone obviously couldn't make a subtraction... Or maybe that was the point.
-   The "30 Years Later" arc in the _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_ has Sonic and Sally become parents, although they still look like their teenage selves. Shadow doesn't count since he's immortal, but how the HELL does the now 45-year-old Sonic still look 15?!

    Fan Fiction 

-   In _The Future Briefing Island_ Midnight is Momo's mother. This caused several issues that were pointed by some readers <sup>explaination&nbsp;</sup> , which the author amended by making Midnight a couple years older than her canon age and stating that she only had Momo a year after graduating from UA.

    Film 

-   _The Count of Monte Cristo (2002)_: Dagmara Domińczyk was twenty six at the film's release. Henry Cavill, who played Albert, the son of her character Mercedes, was nineteen. Meanwhile, Jim Caviezel, who as Dantes turns out to be Albert's true father, was thirty four, which is _slightly_ better. Justified in all cases due to the time frame involved, and the needs of the actors to play their younger selves.
-   _Sorceress_: Robert Ballesteros plays antagonist Traigon both when his daughters are newborn infants and then two decades later, after they're aged up. Both the actresses (twins Lynette and Leigh Harris) are only two years younger, which is glaringly obvious in the film. This _might_ be due to his magic keeping him young: that's not shown though.
-   _Tales of an Ancient Empire_: Janelle Marra, who plays Rajan, was 31 at the time, only seven years more than Inbar Lavi, playing her daughter Alana. Even worse, Michael Pare plays Oda, father of Aedan, played by Kevin Sorbo, who was born less than a month _before_ him. They look about the same age as their onscreen kids, given this.

    Literature 

-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   In the official Black family tree includes birth and death dates; if followed exactly, Sirius' grandfather had his mother when he was only 13. J. K. Rowling is on record that math isn't her strong suit, so many fans assume she just misplaced a decade. Then again, given the Blacks' status as a Big, Screwed-Up Family, it could conceivably be accurate...
-   In W.E.B. Griffin's OSS series, one of the major characters is the son of a Hollywood star, who, if one believes her official studio biography, gave birth to him at thirteen. However, this is entirely due to the studio claiming that she's younger than she actually is due to the fact that she always plays The Ingenue, and they need to make her look as if she's young enough to plausibly play that role (They try not to draw attention to the fact that she has an adult son - who is only legitimate because she married the father for one year to avoid any possible scandal connected to the pregnancy - whenever possible).
    -   In fact, they did everything they could to cover up or erase the evidence, and the mother ends up believing her own "official" bio. When he confronts her, she not only flatly denies that he's her son, but that she could possibly have a son in the first place.
-   In Jane Yolen's Arthurian novel _Sword of the Rightful King,_ it says early on that Gawaine is only four years younger than Arthur (which actually fits well with the early legends). However, a little later Merlinnus reminisces that Gawaine's mother/Arthur's secret half-sister, Morgause, was seven when her mother was pregnant with Arthur. Since the story never implies that Morgause gave birth at 11, this was probably a mistake.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _One Life to Live_, Greg is explicitly stated (in courtroom testimony, no less) to have ten years' experience as a fully licensed practicing neurosurgeon, putting him in his early 40s at the youngest. His mother is played by an actress in her late 40s, and to make things interesting he has a 15-year-old sister. All the characters were introduced during 2009 so SORAS isn't involved.
-   In the third episode of _Girl Meets World_, Topanga tells a small child that she's 30. Topanga and Cory have a daughter, Riley, in 7th grade. If Riley is the normal age for her grade (12-13), Topanga had her when she was 17-18. Given that _Boy Meets World_ goes through Topanga's second year of college and she had no children up until that time, clearly someone didn't do the math. That or she was simply lying about her age.
-   According to _That's So Raven_, Chelsea was born in 1989. That makes her 28 at the start of _Raven's Home_. She has a 4th-grade son and her similarly aged friend Raven has _6th grade_ twins. Either _Raven's Home_ takes place 20 Minutes into the Future, Writers Cannot Do Math, or the two had kids _really_ young.
-   On _Charmed (1998)_:
    -   One episode shows a family tree of the Warren clan, which is a mess of continuity and logic errors. Among them is that Grams would have been 13 when Patty was born. Her age was later retconned to being twenty when Patty was born. Ironically their actresses Jennifer Rhodes and Finola Hughes are actually thirteen years apart in age - although this could be justified by Patty dying in the 70s while Penny only died right before the series began, so Jennifer Rhodes would be playing her across various years in the girls' life.
    -   A rare case with a father. The first actor cast in the role of Victor Bennett, Anthony Denison, got recast after only one episode precisely because he looked far too young. According to Holly Marie Combs, a note from the studio was that he looked more like a slightly older love interest than a father.
-   Pearl Forrester on _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ is played by an actress who is actually two years _younger_ than the actor playing her adult son Clayton. In fact, she actually raised him to adulthood _twice_ due to him being turned into a baby at the end of season 7. Even following the Time Skip, she appears no more than middle aged. Needless to say, the mantra is in full effect here.
-   _Stargirl (2020)_: Given that Hina Khan is only 32, that would mean Anaya was possibly underage when she had Isaac, whose actor looks like he's in his early twenties.
-   _Dark Desire_: Maite Perroni, who plays Alma, was born only fifteen years before Regina Pavón, who portrays Alma's daughter Zoe. Consequently, she looks more like her older sister. There's also no indication that Alma had Zoe as a teenager.
-   Parodied in _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody_. The episode "The Suite Life Goes Hollywood" has a potential sitcom being made about the characters, and Carey is aghast when the actress cast to play her (the mother of eleven-year-olds!) is only twenty-two.

    Video Games 

-   _Dead or Alive_: Ayame, the mother of Hayate, Kasumi, and Ayane. She's had three kids, Hayate being in his early twenties and Kasumi and Ayane being in their late teens (17 and 16, respectively, in the original game), and in her every appearance so far, she doesn't appear to be much older than Kasumi.
-   In _The Sims 3_, Boyd and Susan Wainwright are 11 days until Elder while playing in normal lifespan (AKA they're 62 SimDays old), while their daughter, Blair, is in her very first day of Young Adult (31 SimDays old), meaning that Blair was born while both her parents were in their very first day of Young Adult, and thus she would have been conceived when her parents were teens in "normal gameplay". In the meanwhile (a completely different family/household but still in Sunset Valley) Leighton Sekemoto is 19 days until Adult (basically middle-aged) while his son, Sam, is on his first day of toddler. This is because, while 1 SimDay = 1 Year in the Child, Young Adult, Adult, and Elder Stage, it equals 6 months in the Baby, Toddler, and Teen life stage.
    -   _The Sims 2_ has a few as well; Brandi Broke of Pleasantview is 22 days away from elderhood and Andrew Martin of Riverblossom Hills is 27 days away from elderhood, and both have teenage sons. This would indicate that they were teen parents, but this, of course, is impossible in-game and their memories clearly show them as becoming parents after reaching adulthood.
-   _Super Mario Bros._: Not the case anymore; but the Koopalings were once considered to be Bowser's children along with Junior. Bowser himself is only a few years older than Mario (who is 24), and the Koopalings are all teenagers or young adults. If they're considered Bowser's children; Bowser would only be about ten years older than Ludwig (the eldest).
-   Due to poor translation rather than poor math, an NPC in _Mega Man Battle Network_ says that ten-year-old Lan's grandfather, the famous Dr. Tadashi Hikari, is forty-five years old. Yikes. Later games in the series clarify that Tadashi _died_ at forty-five (of a genetic heart problem) before Lan was born.
-   Professor Oak is around 47 in _Pokémon Red and Blue_. He already has a grandson that is around 11 and a granddaughter that is several years older than that. This means that both Oak and his son had kids in their teens, which is not likely what Game Freak intended.
-   Most of the playable characters in _Dynasty Warriors_ and _Samurai Warriors_ are in their prime age, even those with adult children. The most egregious is probably the Cao family. Cao Cao, the patriarch, is stated to 34, while his son Cao Pi is 27. Cao Pi himself has a son, Cao Rui, who serves as an NPC. This means that Cao Cao was _7_ when he had Cao Pi, and Cao Pi himself must still be a child when he had Cao Rui.

    Web Comics 

-   All the main heroines in _How I Became Yours_.
    -   Katara would have become a mother at age 15 had Mai not induced a miscarriage, and in the epilogue (taking place when she's 23), she has several children who look to be at least 5 years old.
    -   Toph would have been 21 at the time of the epilogue, and she also has seemingly kindergarten-aged kids.
    -   Azula, since she got pregnant during the comic, would have been 17/18 when her child was born.

    Western Animation 

-   On _Gravity Falls,_ the Whole Episode Flashback shows a baby that is probably meant to be Dipper and Mabel's grandfather, Shermie (whom we never see as an adult). "More than ten years" pass before Stan meets Ford again, then another thirty years before the main events of the show. So at this point, Shermie would be a little more than forty years old, but with twelve-year-old grandkids? Even if you assume that "more than ten years" is closer to twenty, that's cutting things pretty close.
    -   Gets Lampshaded in _Gravity Falls: Lost Legends,_ where Shmebulock's String Theory includes the possibility of Blendin's Time Travel being involved.
    -   Granted, this is all based on the assumption that the baby is Shermie. A common fan explanation is that Shermie is actually older than his brothers and the baby was Shermie's child (presumably the twins' father).

Combination/Actually That Young/Other

    Anime and Manga 

-   In the original version of _Digimon Tamers_, Ruki/Rika's age was 10, and her mother Rumiko was 28, meaning she was 18 when she had her. In the dub, Rika's age was increased to 12, which, assuming her mother's age wasn't changed, would make Rumiko 16 when she had her. Rumiko's own mother Seiko is 49, meaning she was 21 when she had Rumiko and in her late 30s when she became a grandmother.
-   This is often the case for most of the parents in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_, who are usually married and/or have children by the time they're in their very early 20s. One of the few exceptions would be Holly Kujo née Joestar, who had Jotaro at the reasonable age of 28. Her paternal grandmother, Lisa Lisa, had her son when she was around 32.
-   Diva from _Blood+_ looks, sounds and even acts very youthful, if not childish and immature. She becomes this after she rapes and kills Riku., who happens to be 13 years old. She does mature slightly a year after the Time Skip.
-   In _Sword Art Online_, Kirito and Asuna adopt the AI Yui as their daughter. At the time, Kirito and Asuna are 16 and 17, respectively. Yui, by virtue of being an AI, is like an 8-year-old despite in fact being 2.
-   Konata's mother Kanata from _Lucky Star_ looked incredibly young throughout her life and (sometimes) acted accordingly. This fact gave fuel for some interesting speculation about the preferences of Konata's father Soujirou.
-   _Tomo-chan Is a Girl!_ gives us Carol's mother Ferris. An extra chapter shows Carol's father Eddie proposing to Ferris, who says she can't get married because she's 13; Eddie freaks out because he thought she was _older_ than him due to her working as a waitress<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and being ridiculously overdeveloped for her age. And then after Ferris accepted the proposal, she mentioned "the little one inside me", triggering a Heroic BSoD in poor Eddie.
-   _Masamune-kun's Revenge_: The title character's mother, Kinue Makabe, looks, acts, and dresses like she's about 9-or-so years old... despite being 42 with two teenage kids.
-   _Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms_: Maquia is from a tribe where Immortality Begins at Twenty with fifteen years old being the aging-stopping age. Adopting a normal human baby at age fifteen technically makes her a Supernaturally Young Parent, but she is also passing as a normal human and her son's biological mother, causing many to mistake her for having had him quite early in life.
-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_: Hakari's mother, Hahari, gave birth at age **13**, via artificial insemination because her lover was about to die from an illness.
-   _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_ has Kagaya, head of the Demon Slayer Corps. He is 23 at the start of the story, and his eldest child is 9, so he was 14 when he became a father. It's revealed that the members of his family are suffering from a curse due to Muzan Kibutsuji being related to them, resulting in all of them dying before the age of 30, so Kagaya _has_ to have children young in order to raise a successor. His wife also counts, having been 17 when their eldest daughters were born.
-   Julia Murai of _Great Teacher Onizuka_ had Kunio when she was 13, and was subsequently disowned by her parents. She somehow managed to get a job, an apartment, and raise a baby as a teenager in Tokyo, one of the most expensive cities in the world. By the time of the series, she's 27, and most of Kunio's male classmates (and his teacher) regard her as a Stacy's Mom. This naturally is a sour spot for Kunio. The Live-Action Adaptation age lifted her to 34, having had Kunio at 17.
-   _Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs_: Despite her looks, Chisaki's mother Hiyori is 36, meaning that she had Chisaki (who is 15-16) at either age 20 or 21.
-   A side-story in _Princess Princess_ revolved around Akira's family from _Family Complex_. Tohru and Yuujirou meet his family, who are all ridiculously good-looking, and begin to guess what Akira's relation is with each of them. The first person they meet is actually the mother, who is a petite woman that barely looks to be old enough to have _four_ children, with two of them already of college age. The same holds true for his father, who easily gets mistaken for Akira's older brother.
-   _Yo-kai Watch_: Lily Adams is supposedly in her thirties. She has the loose flowing hair and facial cast of a college student, and in the show is only about six inches taller than Nate, who is ten years old.
-   _YuYu Hakusho_: Yusuke's mother is only 28, with Yusuke explicitly stating she gave birth to him when she was only 14 (she was 15 in the manga at the time).
-   _A Bride's Story_: Due to the customs of the region and period, this is played straight by Karluk’s sister, Seleke, who has four children, the eldest being eight (that said, the middle two, Torkcan and Chalg, seem to be twins). When Karluk and Amir visit his uncle’s place, one of the women has at least two children (a toddler and a baby) at the age of eighteen. Indeed most mothers in the story seem to have their first child in their late teens.

    Comic Books 

-   A variation: in _Fantastic Four,_ for years, Ben had made casual references to his Aunt Petunia, who had clearly at least helped raise him and who was always understood to be really, really old. When writer/artist John Byrne finally introduced her, she turned out to be young and pretty — not just enough to subvert Ben's stories (the implication being that he was joking), but enough to seem borderline implausible for someone who'd raised him. Since then, we've learned that Ben's uncle did indeed marry a much younger woman than himself, but more to the point, when she showed up at Ben and Alicia's wedding recently, she was portrayed considerably older-looking and said half-jokingly that she'd seriously let herself go in recent years.

    Fan Works 

-   _Past Sins_
    -   Twilight adopts the magically generated Nyx. Biologically, they're a late teen<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and child respectively, and that's not even going into the newly-made or millennium-old question with Nyx. And things get even _weirder_ when Nyx is artificially aged up to an adult _horse_...
    -   There's also the fact that some of Twilight's blood was used in the ritual to resurrect Nightmare Moon (due to her status as the Element of Magic), possibly making her a Truly Single Parent or with some influence from Princess Luna.
-   _Aki-chan's Life_ is a particularly extreme example, with fourteen- or fifteen-year-old Asuka and Shinji being parents of a four-year-old girl. Time travel was involved.
    -   Of course, even in the previous story, Asuka was probably only about fifteen or sixteen when she gave birth to Aki. Even that's just a guess on her and Shinji's part as they weren't bothering to keep track of time after the apocalypse.
-   _The Child of Love_: Asuka gave birth to Teri when she and Shinji were fifteen. During her birthday she admits she is too young to be a mother.
-   _Ghosts of Evangelion_: Kyoko is only a few years older than her daughter because she was a bodiless soul for twenty years.
-   In RainbowDoubleDash's Lunaverse, Ditzy Doo was just _barely_ legal when she got pregnant with Dinky.
-   _Bait and Switch_: When Yui returns from EVA-01 (actually Shinji in his mother's body), she's only twenty-four due to not having aged after spending a decade without a body.
-   _The Differentverse_: Twilight hatched her adoptive son Spike when she was eleven. She's 21 in the present day.
-   _Oversaturated World_: While Ditzy Doo presumably _gave birth_ to Dinky at a more normal age, she subsequently decided to send Dinky back in time to spend time with her teenage self, ending up in this trope.
-   This is a plot point in _Red Jewel Diaries_ when Fate tells Lindy that a DNA test said that her biological father is Clyde. Lindy instantly points out that it's impossible since Clyde was only 10 when Alicia (the girl Fate was cloned from) was born. When Fate does some investigating, she finds out that her father was actually an aged up clone of Clyde who was (at most) three years old.
-   _Black Sky_: Dorea Black gets herself married after her fifteenth birthday and immediately gets pregnant with twins. Her husband also is an example since he was only sixteen when she conceived, and almost six years spent in cold storage ensured he _stayed_ sixteen while the kids are now five years old, which logically would mean he fathered them at _eleven_, almost twelve years old.
-   _Child of the Storm_:
    -   Lily and James Potter, with the author calculating that Lily would have got pregnant at 19 and a half. Of course, the case is a touch odder here, since James was Thor in mortal form (and entirely unaware of it), meaning that he was technically 1500 when Harry was conceived.
    -   Minerva McGonagall was no more than 20 when she got pregnant with Clint's mother, by Bucky Barnes.
    -   The Carter-Danvers-O'Neill family has the high end of this (i.e. children being born between 19-21 years old) in several generations, with the author admitting that he didn't realize until too late that he was trying to fit too many generations into too short a time-span for more standard gaps. In particular, Jack O'Neill is the second child of Alison Carter, Peggy Carter's little sister (actually, her daughter by Steve Rogers), who was born in 1945, is a Brigadier General and has an adult daughter, Sharon Carter, who's a qualified SHIELD Agent when the story starts in late 2006. This means that he was born 1966 at the very latest, when his mother was 21, implying that she was at most 20 when her first child, Marie, was born, and that he was about 20 or so when Sharon was born - a nod is given to this when it's mentioned that Sharon was 'something of a surprise to her parents' in how early she arrived.
-   _Dragonstone_ features a wedding between Jon Stark and Margaery Tyrell, both being thirteen years old only - the agreement was that they would wed after Margaery's first period, and she's older than Jon. She gives birth to their firstborn son Duncan when she's only fourteen.
-   In _Arcadia or Bust_, Claire is mistakenly thought of being NotEnrique's teen mom by Bill Miller as he is threatening her.
-   In _Married to the Koopa King_, Bowser has eight kids and several are preteens but he's not even thirty. He was married at fifteen to a slightly older girl and began having kids right away.
-   Zinnia in _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, while her age isn't explicitly stated, is heavily implied to be somewhere in her mid-teens, and her daughter Aster is already a toddler. In this case, it's justified, as a later side story reveals she was raped.
-   _Warm Milk and Galaxies_ parodies the famous _The Empire Strikes Back_ scene where Vader is revealed as Luke's father, crossing over with _My Hero Academia_, where All for One as The Emperor reveals to Izuku as Luke that _Shigaraki_ as Darth Vader was his father. Shigaraki seems to be in his mid-20s, while Izuku's 15. It turns out to be All Just a Dream of Izuku's, and his real father gets a kick out of it when Izuku tells him.
-   _Steal the Truth, Reach Out For Your Heart_: In the years since _Persona 4_, Yukiko has become a mother of two young kids with a third on the way by the time she’s 26. Her firstborn child, Tsuneo, is 6 years old, meaning she gave birth when she was 20, which Word of God confirms.
-   In _Safe Anchorage_, Jeyne gives birth to her Child by Rape at 13.
-   In _Freedom's Limits_, Madavi and Smador are indicated to be only around fourteen or fifteen years old when their eldest child is born. This is justified, as being quite young and unworldly (including not realizing female humans have some biological differences from female Orcs) pregnancy never actually crossed their minds when they began having a sexual relationship.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _May December_: Gracie and Joe's first child was born when she was thirty-six and he was _thirteen_ (and he is, in fact, the same age as Gracie's son from her previous marriage); as a result, Joe looks more and acts like his children's older brother than their father. While in his late thirties in the present day, a time that Elizabeth notes is when most people are just starting to consider having kids, he has a college-aged daughter and two twins who are about to graduate high school.
-   _Tommy Boy_: Tommy's new stepmom Beverly (Bo Derek) looks very young for someone who has an adult son (Paul, Rob Lowe). It later turns out that they aren't actually a mother and son, but a pair of married con artists who scammed Tommy's father.

    Literature 

-   _Acid Row_:
    -   Melanie Patterson isn't even twenty yet, already has two children and is six months pregnant with her third child. She had her first child, Rosie, when she was only fourteen.
    -   Gaynor Patterson is indicated to be unusually young for a _grand_mother; both her youngest son and her eldest granddaughter are four-years-old (her son is actually younger than her granddaughter by a few months). Gaynor's eldest daughter was in her early teens when she first got pregnant and it's implied Gaynor herself started having children when she was quite young.
-   _A Brother's Price_ justifies this trope by changing the definition of "mother". All sisters of a child's birth mother who are still part of the same family group<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  are her mothers. This makes possible a situation in which someone's mother is the same age as her, or possibly even younger.
-   Seems to be pretty heavily implied as the norm in _Allegiant_, given that Natalie and Andrew were together before they entered Abnegation together, and that the Bureau requires that all persons entering the experiment promise to have a minimum number of children to ensure the survival of their "corrected genes".
-   In _Die Alchimistin_, Sylvette gives birth at eight. It isn't clear whether it was fully natural or the Big Bad stimulated her puberty somehow (he was probably able to do that).
-   In _Alice, Girl from the Future_ the Pirate Queen first appears as a strikingly beautiful woman in her twenties. She is also the mother of Rat who is definitely much older than that, which is lampshaded by the hero. Then her young face turns out to be a mask, and what lies beneath is so horrid that the author doesn't even describe it.
-   The medieval fantasy world of _The Hero Took Everything from Me, So I Partied with the Hero’s Mother!_ is one where giving birth at the age of 15 is not unusual, though it is also a world where few people live past the age of 50 as well.
-   In _Magic or Madness_, all magic-user parents were absurdly young when they had their kids because magic is Cast From Life Span (and if you don't use it, you go insane). This causes several problems, since said mothers weren't mature enough to properly raise children.
-   Played for Drama in _We Can't Rewind_: Denise is indicated to have given birth at _eleven_. Later, due to a "Freaky Friday" Flip, her daughter Jaymee also manages to give birth at age _ten_, albeit from her mother's adult body.
-   In the Colleen McCullough novel _The Touch_, heroine Elizabeth gives birth to her daughters Nell and Anna at 16 and 17, respectively. When Anna is raped and impregnated at 13, she becomes an example of this too and makes Elizabeth an absurdly youthful _grandmother_.
-   In _The Giver_, Jonas mentions that "birthmothers", like everyone else, have their profession chosen for them at the age of twelve, and that they start having babies not long after that.
-   In the _Earth's Children_ series, Ayla gives birth to her son, Durc, when she is _eleven_ years old. It's worth noting that this is normal among the Clan, since they mature faster than the Others. However, since Ayla is one of the Others, having a baby at such a young age puts a considerable strain on her and she nearly suffers Death by Childbirth. Jondalar later tells her that most women of the Others are at least in their early teens when they give birth for the first time, which is still considered too young by some people. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Eleanor & Park_: Eleanor’s mother Sabrina is somewhere in her thirties, which is awfully young to be a parent to a teenager and four other children. A conversation between her and Eleanor’s stepfather imply that she got pregnant with her daughter when she was in high school, making it a Teen Pregnancy.
-   In the young adult novel _Mama Had A Little Store_, the protagonist, who is about 12 years old, comments on how young a classmate's mother looks. The classmate, who lives in poverty and whose community is discriminated against for their race, replies, "She twenty-five."
-   _Meg Langslow Mysteries_: In "No Nest for the Wicket," Merg looks up some photos of Mayor Pain George Pruitt’s ancestors and observes a picture of one woman glaring at her husband shortly after the birth of their fourteenth child (she went on to have three more). She notes that the woman would have been too young to babysit by modern standards when she had her first child. Possibly subverted with the later reveal that the picture and accompanying news stories are fakes made to prank the Pruitts, and it isn't even clear if that couple existed.
-   In _A Tree Grows in Brooklyn_ Sissy gets married right after she turns fourteen and has a stillbirth on her fifteenth birthday.
-   _While My Pretty One Sleeps_: When Neeve talks to a woman who was recently fired from one of Gordon Steuber's sweatshops, she's shocked when the woman mentions her daughter also worked for Steuber, as Neeve thinks the woman looks no older than her late twenties. The woman says her daughter is only fourteen, implying she wasn't very old herself when she got pregnant. Neeve is particularly disgusted that Gordon would exploit such vulnerable people.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_: In "The Doctor Dances", the Doctor discovers that Nancy, who claims to be Jamie's sister and looks young enough to match, is actually his mother, having gotten pregnant when she was 16.
-   _Boardwalk Empire_: Jimmy Darmody's first scene in the pilot with Gillian plays as if he's meeting his mistress (an assumption many characters make) as they appear roughly the same age and she is very affectionate with him. We later discover Gillian was sexually assaulted at age 12, resulting in Jimmy's conception. It also explains her general lack of boundaries, both with her son and many other men.
-   In _Waco_, Michelle was twelve when Koresh had a 'vision' that she would be his second wife. She is fourteen at the time of the series, with a toddler named Serenity.
-   In _Shameless_, Ethel has a Child by Rape from her 65 year old husband Clyde at the age of 13.
-   In _iCarly (2021)_, Freddie has a ten-year-old stepdaughter named Millicent. Millicent's mother Gwen seems to be around the same age as Freddie (mid-late twenties), which would make Millicent a product of a Teen Pregnancy.
-   _The Crowded Room_: Emmy Rossum played Candy Sullivan, Danny's mother, when he's both a little boy and young adult. Tom Holland plays Danny, who's nine years younger than her. It's somewhat justified as it turns out she had Danny while just seventeen.

    Music 

-   Gender flipped in the folk song _He's Young But He's Daily Growing_. A woman whose age is "twice twelve" complains of her arranged marriage to a much younger boy. The last verse of the song usually begins, "At the age of fourteen he was a married man; at the age of fifteen the father of my son..." In one version the boy was married at twelve and a father at thirteen.

    Radio 

-   In an episode of _In Our Time_ looking at _Oedipus Rex_, one guest says that it's a mistake for Jocasta to be played by an older actress because "she cannot be more than about 52. Oedipus is about 38 or 40. \[...\] So Oedipus turns up at 20, this brilliant young buck, and gets off with this incredibly sexy woman, who's around 31." She doesn't really elaborate on this.

    Myths & Religion 

-   In Celtic Mythology, specifically _The Cattle Raid of Cooley,_ Cú Chulainn is said to be seventeen when he dies. He also mentions that his son Connla was seven when Cú Chulainn killed him. For added weirdness, Connla was conceived when Cú Chulainn pulled a Dub Con/Best Her to Bed Her situation on the mother, Aífe, which _definitely_ falls under Troubling Unchildlike Behavior.

    Theater 

-   In _Romeo and Juliet_, Lady Capulet offhandedly mentions that she was the same age as her daughter when she gave birth to Juliet (thirteen), implying that she's only 26- to 28-years-old at the very least. However, at one point, Lord Capulet implies they had other children who died. Juliet may have been the youngest of several offspring, all the rest deceased.
    -   Given how much blood is shed due to the feud, it's not hard to believe that several Capulet siblings were killed by Montagues before the action of the play began.
-   In _Next to Normal_, Diana and Dan both claim that, when their son was born, they were each "a child, raising a child". During a flashback, it's revealed that Dan was 21 when Diana got pregnant, but it's never actually stated how old Diana is.
-   In _Elisabeth_, Archduchess Sophie takes charge of her oldest granddaughter from her mother Elisabeth, claiming that it was because a child couldn't raise a child. In real life, Sisi gave birth at the age of 17, ten months after her wedding. Her other children (Gisela and Rudolf) were born when she was 19 and 21, and was also whisked away by Sophie senior for the same reason. The musical featured what amounted to a custody battle, which Sisi won at the end of act 1.

    Video Games 

-   _Harvest December_:
    -   Masaki finds out that his girlfriend Yuki Towada's parents are both 34, and realizes that since Yuki is 17 that means her parents were the same age when she was born.
    -   In August, a mystic ceremony causes both Yuki and the goddess Shiro to become pregnant with Masaki's children. Shirou gives birth in December that year, while Yuki gives birth during her and Masaki's graduation.
-   In _HuniePop_, Jessie is 36, but has a daughter (Tiffany) who is 20. Jessie makes no secret of the fact that she got pregnant at 16, and in fact, this is why she dropped out of high school and went to work in the adult entertainment industry.
-   _Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War_ leans hard on the medieval ethos of when people were considered adults who could start their own family. This is most obvious with Ethlyn, the protagonist's younger sister, who is eighteen when the game begins and has recently given birth to her first child with the husband she is Happily Married to. By the time the first generation ends she is twenty and has a newborn son.
-   Supplementary material for _Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia_ reveals that King Lima IV became king of Zofia at a fairly young age, and the given timeline means that he was _at most_ in his early/mid-thirties at the time of his death. Hidden data in the game also gives his two surviving children's ages as 21 and 17. This means that Lima couldn't have been much more than 12-13 at the time of Conrad's conception if one is incredibly generous with the description of "young." Considering Lima was a notorious womanizer and implied Royal Brat, it's unclear if the writers actually meant for him to be that young of a father or if they simply didn't realize the implications.
-   In _The Last of Us_, Joel tells Ellie that he didn't go to college because he already had his daughter. That means he wouldn't have been older than about 18 when she was born. Sarah was twelve when she died in the prologue, which means his birthday the day before she died would have probably been his 28th, 29th, or 30th.
-   In _Yakuza 6_, Haruka Sawamura, adopted daughter to the main playable character Kiryu Kazuma, is revealed to have given birth to a newborn son, Haruto, while Kiryu spent three years in prison, as a result, he goes out on a wild goose chase to find the father for a majority of the game's plot.
-   In _Shinrai: Broken Beyond Despair_, Rihatsu Shinpuku was born on March 10, 1975, while her daughter Raiko was born on August 14, 1996, making Rihatsu less than 21 years old when she got pregnant with Raiko. Raiko's older sister, Reiko, was born on November 5, 1992, meaning that Rihatsu gave birth to her at _17_.
-   _The Sims_ games starting from _2_ allow you to invoke this by using age-defying items such as The Elixir of Life and The Age Freeze Potion, allowing a sim to stay youthful even as their children age and grow up. From _3_ on, it's possible to manipulate the lifespan of each life stage, so that a sim could become this.
    -   The Create-A-Sim mostly averts this; In _2_, adults can only be made siblings or spouses to other adults, never parents, and the same applies to elders. Similarly in _3_', adults can only be siblings, spouses or romantic partners to other adults or young adults. In both _3_ and _4_, however, a young adult can be parent to a teenager, and _4_ also allows an adult to be parent to a young adult, potentially creating this situation.
-   Discussed and lampshaded in _The Walking Dead: Season Two_. In the "Go with Jane" ending, a man who needs Clem's and Jane's help, will ask Clem if the baby she's holding is hers. He quickly corrects himself, seeing how Clem is only 11. AJ, the baby, was the son of two adult survivors from Clem's old group, who she is now taking care of.
-   _Trials of Mana_ mentions that Angela looks very much like her mother, True Queen Valda. Said queen looks barely older than her daughter.
-   _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_: Arven looks like he’s in his mid-to-late teens, but his parents, Sada and Turo, look like their in their early-to-mid twenties. It turns out that the Sada or Turo (depending on the version) that the player has been following is actually an AI replica that they created, and the real Sada/Turo died long ago during a lab accident, explaining why they look so youthful.

    Web Comics 

-   In _Sleepless Domain_, when Kokoro begins to tell Undine the story of how she came to be and why her windows don't match her curtains (as is typical for Magical Girls here), flashbacks showing her mother Mitsuki when she finds out she's pregnant show her as not looking much older than Kokoro, who's a teenager. Kokoro soon confirms that her mother was seventeen when she had her. This is a plot point: magical girls who get pregnant while still active lose their powers when they're transferred to the child in the womb, which is why Kokoro has her mother's blue eyes. The MGSI is _very_ keen on covering that up, because it would remind people that magical girls are human, and not perfect soldiers willing to live and die for the city like they want people to believe.
-   Jean Poule in _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ is clearly too young to have three teenage-looking daughters, but they're artificial (and also clearly not human). Counting a robot and a Mechanical Abomination, she's got two _grandchildren,_ too.
    
    **Voluptua**: (to Jean) _"And your family has too many kids. But you know that."_
    
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, this is implied by Elliot's mother responding to Ellen's arrival with thinking that she had always wanted a daughter and then that this time she won't have to drop out of anything, and then confirmed when Sarah realizes that she would have had to have been 21 or younger when she gave birth to Elliot.

    Web Original 

-   In _Ace Attorney according to an AI_, Vera Misham, who was 19 as of the present-day portion of Turnabout Succession, is the mother of a five-year-old son in Case #6.
-   _Kittisaurus_: When Dr Kim examines Nana (then referred to as the mother cat), he remarks that she is barely two years old technically making her a teenager when she gave birth to her sons. Fortunately, when her kittens are old enough, Claire has her spayed so this won't happen again.

    Western Animation 

-   In _The Amazing World of Gumball_ episode "The Singing" Mrs. Jötunheim states that she just turned 28 and is the mother of Hector who is in middle school, which is around 11 or 12. This implies that Hector was conceived when she was 16 or 17.
-   Exaggerated in _Drawn Together_, Foxxy Love, despite being _20_, has a teenage grandson. Of course, since it's established that cartoons don't age and since she is from the 70s, it could be a justified situation. Another episode showed that **babies** can get pregnant, so it's still plausible.
-   _Family Guy_: In "To Love and Die in Dixie", after Meg tells her friends that Chris is going to be killed, a _five year old girl_ tells Meg that she has a daughter of her own who would most likely grow up to admire Meg.
-   _The Jetsons_ has the 33-year-old Jane Jetson being mother to the 15-year-old Judy Jetson. While it _seems_ like a case of Writers Cannot Do Math at first, the show was made in 1962 and at the time, it was common to marry at a young age, so Jane may very well have been intended to have been a teenage bride and mother. Either that or _The Jetsons_' universe runs on different calendar.
-   The _Captain Planet_ episode “101 Mutations” is about puppy mills. Linka says that one of the dogs looks too young to be a mother. The sad fact is that puppy mill dogs are usually bred when they’re still puppies themselves.
-   In _South Park_, Kenny is actually the middle child in his family (despite him being resurrected all the time): he has an older brother named Kevin and a younger sister named Karen. While his dad Stuart looks around the same age as the other South Park dads (40s-50s), Carol looks like she’s in her 30s AT MOST. Kenny is now ten years old, so it’s likely that Kevin was a teen pregnancy.
-   _The Simpsons_ shows that Kearney has at least one kid. While we’re not sure exactly how old Kearney is, in one episode he says he’s both “a teenager and the parent of a teenager”. If this were true, he would have had to conceive his first child at six years old, since he would have to be 19 and his eldest kid 13 for this to make sense. Squick indeed.
