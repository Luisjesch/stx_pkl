With their long ears, twitchy noses, and rounded fluffy bodies, bunnies are often used in media to invoke feelings of sweetness, innocence, childishness and general cuteness. Real rabbits can be used for this, but so can stuffed rabbits or other types of toy rabbits or rabbit related accessories. Characters meant to be viewed as cute might have a rabbit-related Animal Motif. Very energetic personalities and Nice Guy (or Nice Girl) personalities are often common with these characters.

Stuffed bunnies might also be used to invoke the concept of children caught in a horrific situation if used in an Empathy Doll Shot. Contrast Hair-Raising Hare and Killer Rabbit, and compare Playboy Bunny.

See also Cute Kitten, Precious Puppy, and Ridiculously Cute Critter.

Not to be confused with Bridge Bunnies.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_:
    -   Negi Springfield wears a bunny costume during a part of the festival arc. While he is wearing the outfit, his normally serious behavior is replaced with childish enthusiasm, and other characters comment on how cute the outfit makes him.
    -   Nodoka sometimes wears a bunny backpack as a cute accessory to her adventuring outfit.
-   _Ouran High School Host Club_ uses a bunny motif for the "Boy Lolita" character Honey to help establish his identiy as the cute character of the Host Club. He frequently carries a stuffed rabbit called "Usa-chan", uses a "bunny kick" as one of his martial arts moves, and is himself sometimes compared to a rabbit. He also has bunny patterns on many of his belongings, and a bunny background pattern is sometimes used in the manga in panels that feature him.
-   _Pita-Ten_ has an angel named Misha who wears bunny shaped hair decorations which signify her childish and cute characterization.
-   Vivio in the _Lyrical Nanoha_ series has a bunny motif associated with her, fitting her bright and positive personality. In _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid_, even her Device is shaped like a bunny.
    -   Vita also had a stuffed bunny, whose design can be seen on her nice hat.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   Standoffish and cool Rukia has a soul candy dispenser with a cute bunny face on it.
    -   Lampshaded when Ichigo learns that Rukia was trying to get that one for _him_ when she got Kon (who came in a duck-faced dispenser). He calls her on the cutesyness and, in a sort of nervous anger, she responds that she likes bunnies.
-   In _Nura: Rise of the Yokai Clan_, Kana Ienaga has pink bunny decorations on her bag.
-   The _Happy Happy Clover_ anime and manga<small>◊</small> by Sayuri Tatsuyama is fond of this trope.<small>◊</small> Just about every rabbit<small>◊</small> is like this.<small>◊</small> Especially Mallow<small>◊</small> and Clover.<small>◊</small>
-   _Fruits Basket_ has Momiji, who is possessed by the Spirit of the Rabbit. He's the only Member of the Zodiac who really embraces his Zodiac form, as evidenced by the bunny plushies, bunny hoodies, bunny backpacks, bunny stationary, and being the first male Juunishi to hug Tohru on purpose. Somewhat subverted, though, since he's actually one of the most emotionally mature of the Sohmas (even though he looks like the youngest).
-   Bokko/Captain Bunny<small>◊</small> from Osamu Tezuka's "The Amazing 3" is an older example in Anime/Manga going as far back as 1965. She was voiced by Corrine Orr in the English Dub.
-   This is one contributor of _Is the Order a Rabbit?_'s cuteness; the town is literally full of cute bunnies. Businesses also often have "rabbit" in their names.
-   Sanrio is fond of this trope. As of 2008, there are three anime shows that star talking rabbits. Such as My Melody, Ruby and The Sugarbunnies. In 2010, a new Sanrio character series was created called "Wish Me Mell"<small>◊</small> which stars a friendly rabbit named "Mell" who is meant to be a character that expresses the feelings every one has, simply stating "Thank you", "I am sorry" or "I like you!", connecting hearts in the process. While the character hasn't gotten an anime series yet, she's pretty popular in Japan to the point that Sanrio even gave her an official a Facebook,Twitter, and Vine account. There's also BonBonRibbon<small>◊</small> that was created in 2012. Who is another rabbit character. Let's just say, Sanrio really loves rabbits.
-   Iyo one of the talking stuffed animals from<small>◊</small> _Animal Yokocho_.
-   _Mimirin_ from _Shima Shima Tora no Shimajirō_. The only one word that can adequately describe her is _Dawwwwwwwwww!_
-   From _Jewelpet_, there's Ruby, who's the protagonist, as well as Luea, Luna, Io and the non-canon, light novel only Lollip.
    -   There are also the Sweetspets Eclan and Macaronia.
-   Patty Rabbit<small>◊</small> from the 1986 series _Maple Town_ is a very caring and adventurous rabbit. She really cares for her friends and family, especially her baby brother and her best friend Bobby.
-   _Suzy's Zoo: Daisuki! Witzy_: Lulla, who's a musical fluffy plush white rabbit. It doesn't get any better than this.
-   In _BanG Dream!_, Tae Hanazono owns _twenty_ rabbits, one of which she calls her "boyfriend" and whom she even takes to see her perform in concert. In the video game spinoff _BanG Dream! Girls Band Party!_, one event has a bunch of her school's bunnies escape, and she and her friends work together to get them all back, with the associated gacha cards featuring them playing with or trying to catch the shy critters.
-   Deconstructed with Haru from _Beastars_. Because she's a rabbit, everyone treats her like she's an adorable, defenseless creature, and she hates it. The main reason she Really Gets Around is because she feels that people only ever take her seriously during sex.
-   Lavie of _Lapis Re:LiGHTs_ takes care of two rabbits in Flora Girls' Academy and in EP 3, her friend and fellow LiGHTS member Ashley uses a bunny patch to fix her PE uniform.
-   Chapters 94 and 95 of _'Tis Time for "Torture," Princess_ are mainly an excuse to draw adorable rabbits (Chapter 94 sees Krall use one as the day's "torture", while Chapter 95 is Torture's perspective on 94's events).
-   _Hyakunichikan!!_: Adorable five-year-old Chiho is often associated with rabbits, especially her expressive Girlish Pigtails. Later on she and Shuuto adopt a pet rabbit she found as a stray.

    Asian Animation 

-   Netflix cartoon _Harry and Bunnie_ Has the titualur Bunnie as something of a subversion. Bunnie is nice enough normally, but he stole Harry's magic wand in the first place causing the whole conflict in the first place.
-   _Pleasant Goat Fun Class_: Miss Earth, the rabbit who guides the goats around the amusement park rides in the season _The Earth Carnival_, is a pretty adorable and nice little rabbit.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Total Drama Island_ reimagining, _The Legend of Total Drama Island_, the gentle and inoffensive D.J. finds and adopts a bunny during the camping challenge, as per canon; but where the original played the trope more or less straight, the reimagining subverts the trope when the bunny's grisly demise triggers a conflict storyline.
-   Khilari's _Everything's Better With Bunnies_ is based off this trope: it's an AU where Loki involuntarily shapeshifts into a bunny whenever he's upset.
-   Shampoo's Badass Adorable credentials get pushed up a notch in _Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse_ after she eats a Zoan-type Devil Fruit; the Rabbit-Rabbit Fruit. It actually merges with her pre-existing Jusenkyo Spring of Drowned Cat curse and causes her to turn into a _cabbit_, which is noted to be utterly adorable. Even Ranma, utterly terrified of cats, think Shampoo is too cute to be scary in this form. But she can still kick all the ass she needs to.

    Films — Animation 

-   In the sequel to _The Emperor's New Groove_ called _Kronk's New Groove_, near the end of Kronk's story about the citizens getting tricked by Yzma for lying about the potion turning them young. Near the end of the chase between her and the angry old people, she turns herself into a cute pink bunny which makes the elders gush and start forgiving her until she gets grabbed by a bird and is later seen inside a bird's nest near the end of the film.
-   In _Rise of the Guardians_ there is Bunnymund, which is reverted to the size of an adorable little rabbit, once children all over the world stopped believing in the Easter Bunny.
    
    **Jamie**: What happened to him? He used to be huge and cool, and now he's cute!
    
-   Deconstructed in _Zootopia_. In Zootopia, this is the widely acknowledged stereotype of bunnies, though only other bunnies can call bunnies cute, and Judy gives the Innocently Insensitive Clawhauser a friendly reminder of this. Fans speculate that non-bunnies calling bunnies cute means their personal merits, their intelligence in particular, aren't being valued.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _8 Mile_, B. Rabbit's friends insist that his name is because of his speedy rapping and promiscuity, but it's later revealed to be the pet name his mother gave him for his big ears, buck teeth and extreme cuteness. Later in the movie, she gushes over his cute face and tells him that he'll always be her little bunny rabbit.
-   _Cool World_:
    -   Double subverted with an unnamed bunny character seen gambling with Holli's goons. He/she is one of the only doodles who look sane compared to the others, but does go Hair-Raising Hare mode on the doodle police officers when they ignore seeing him/her cry about getting cheated by said goons. By climbing up on one officer's face. The bunny then goes "Pretty Please", starting the chase scene with the cops and goons.
    -   The mother bunnies children also fit this trope, despite only having a brief scene prior to Holli and Jack's sex scene.
-   Roger Rabbit from _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ can be this sometimes, especially in his cartoon shorts, but you don't want to get on his bad side when something personal happens.

    Jokes 

-   Defied in this one which borders on Black Comedy: a little girl walks into a pet store full of bunnies and asks the clerk in a sweet, kiddy voice, "_Exc-kuse_ me, _mither_, can I have have a _widdle_ bunny?"  
    The clerk, seeing a Cheerful Child in his shop, decides to entertain her. "Yes, sweetie, of course. Would you like a cutie _bwown_ bunny, or a little _fuwwy white wabby_, or maybe a _bushy gwey wabby_ with a cute _widdle pinkie nosey_?"  
    At which point the little girl replies, "I don't _fink_ my pet _pyfon_ gives a _thith_."

    Live-Action TV 

-   On _Psych_, Gus attempts to use bunnies to break the news to Shawn that he has a secret girlfriend. It doesn't work. Then it does.
-   In _M\*A\*S\*H_, the resident Country Mouse owns a bunny named Fluffy. Said Country Mouse is one of the most innocent people in the series.
-   The live-action edutainment show geared towards infants called _Harry The Bunny_ stars a cute young bunny named Harry.
-   _Schitt's Creek_ has an In-Universe example when Alexis sets up a bunny cam in Kindly Vet Ted's office to help adopt out the animals. However, Ted ends up giving some accidental Fanservice to the bunny cam viewers by getting undressed in front of the camera after his run.

    Literature 

-   Beatrix Potter used this trope many times in her children's books, like _The Tale of Peter Rabbit_ and _The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies_. The bunnies were always presented as cute and adorable.
-   The little-known _Emily the Rabbit_ books by Claire Masurel and Susan Calitri has the adorable-beyond-words titular character. No relations to D.W.'s classmate who shares the same name and species.
-   _Pat the Bunny_ by Dorothy Kunhardt—which most people have at least read once in their childhood.
-   _Guess How Much I Love You_ by Sam McBratney and Anita Jeram—another childhood classic.
-   _Abigail_ from Hallmark's line of Interactive Story Buddies toy and book series.
-   _Okies_ has a rather adorable artistic main character that's as cute as a button. It helps she has a twin sister who shares similar traits.
-   Rosemary Wells is fond of bunny characters in her books. _Max and Ruby_, _Bunny Planet_, and _Read To Your Bunny_ are great examples.
-   The covers of some editions of _Watership Down_ may have vaguely implied this. The actual story, on the other hand...
-   _The Velveteen Rabbit_ is a stuffed rabbit, but still evokes this.

    Music 

-   _Doctor Steel_ flirted with adorkableness once; after visiting a music website whose anime-inspired animation seemed to consist of "Tiny Little Bunnies Eating Hamburgers", he wrote a song about it.
-   In the video for _Ladytron's Ghosts_, many rabbits add cuteness to imagery that would otherwise be quite dark. It's in context a Shout-Out to _Watership Down_, as one of the lyrics alludes to "prince of a thousand enemies".
-   Snuggle Bunny (Schnuffel) is one of Jamba!'s more well-known mascots. He's a cute little gray and white lop eared rabbit who sings adorable, Chipmunks\-eqsue songs, many of which are very catchy.
    -   A few years later, Jamster created a second bunny character named Snuggelina (Schnuffelienchen) who is Snuggle's girlfriend and both really love each other.<small>◊</small> There are two songs by Snuggelina that mainly focuses on her relationship with Snuggle both in German and English while one is her singing about a Butterfly.
-   K-pop girl group _NewJeans_ apparently LOVES this trope so much that there's a _huge metric ton_ of rabbit imagery in their albums, music videos, and merchandise. Now, where to begin...
    -   Their bunny mascot (shown on four of the album covers) is possibly the most famous of the subject. If we want to described it, it's a rabbit drawn in a 90s-style cartoon roller-skating, complete with a heart symbol in each of her eyes. Made even cuter when there's now an animated picture of the same bunny happily hopping up and down<small>◊</small>, and its two hands were holding what was now the said girl group's official lightstick.
        -   But wait, there's more! Now there's also this image<small>◊</small>, featuring the same bunny, cutely blowing up a candle of a cake, smiling as the flame on top of it went out.
        -   And apparently, the bunny mascot has 5 other colored versions of the mascot, with each of them representing each of the members. The yellow bunny represents Minji, the pink bunny represents Hanni, the green bunny represents Danielle, the blue bunny represents Hyein, and the generic white represents Haerin. It's worth noting that the aforementioned colored bunnies were present in each of the members' individual "New Jeans Bluebook" albums.
        -   The 5 bunnies also first appear in a teaser of the said group debuting soon at that time, as shown in this GIF.<small>◊</small>
        -   And guess what! They also finally got a short animation of them, entitled "Let's Make A Cake Together". And be warned, this video contains TONS of cuteness. It starts off with the green rabbit holding a giant strawberry, followed by the white rabbit carrying stars (and what was speculated to be sprinkles). It later cuts to the pink rabbit.....who was actually not helping at all and is busy eating the cream. Then there's a blue rabbit, who effortlessly manages to bring a giant candle, _while the top is still flaming_, and the yellow bunny is also shown cheering her friends. And near the end of the short, it reveals a super adorable cake resembling a giant bunny. The rabbits celebrated the hard work as they circled around the cake, except for the pink rabbit, who was still busy eating and didn't care about the whole situation that was happening surrounding her.
    -   The bunny caps that were worn by the group members in the "OMG" music video. Enough said.
        -   Speaking of the "OMG" music video, the girl group collaborated with a popular cafe named Nudake, to promote the new single released around December (and for a limited time). In this collaboration, Nudake released 5-colored rabbit-shaped mini cakes, complete with a red heart in the middle of the heads that was certainly too cute to eat. At that event, they also released many Christmas-themed items, and it also features their bunny mascot (again), but this time, wearing a scarf and can be seen riding on Santa's sleigh on one of their items.
        -   Also related to the latest album above, the official website of the girl group used to have a feature where it shows a house in the middle of a snowy landscape, and in front of it shows a realistic baby rabbit (and it also moves), which is adorable enough. One of the cutest parts of the website features a bunny snowman, in the middle of the card, which also has writing at the bottom that says "Winter Comes". As the card was clicked, it shows an interactive DIY card that lets you decorate a digital replica of the aforementioned Nudake bunny cake, which you can choose in 5 different colors and put cake toppers on. As you finish your card, it starts displaying your finished cake while a snippet of "Ditto" is played in the background.
        -   The website also used to have an interactive camera where it lets you take a picture of yourself, and decorate your photo with adorable, yet realistic bunny silhouettes and of course, the five-colored bunny mascots.
    -   Around the time the girl group released their latest album "Get Up", Line Friends started a collaboration with them and released what was possibly _one of their most adorable creations_. Ladies and gents, say hello to the "Bunnies"!
    -   In Coca-Cola's music video "Be Who You Are (Real Magic)", the girls are seen piloting a auper adorable humongous rabbit mecha, and also seen accompanied with rabbit-eared camera bots, which was also pretty cute.

    Pinball 

-   In _Slick Chick_, the various Playboy Bunnies are accompanied by a distinctively cartoonish rabbit.

    Puppet Shows 

-   In _The Jim Henson Hour_, Bean Bunny's role as the Ridiculously Cute Critter is repeatedly lampshaded.

    Toys 

    Video Games 

-   _Jumping Flash!_: Robbit himself. Because why else would you be a robotic space rabbit?
-   _Doom_: Used for humorous effect in the episode "Thy Flesh Consumed". The finale of the original campaign saw Doomguy heading home to earth to find it overrun by demons. As if the invasion itself wasn't bad enough, they even killed his pet rabbit Daisy and stuck her head on a spike. And if you thought Doomguy was mad at the demons _before_...
-   In the _Touhou Project_ series, we have the Spin-Off Yonkoma manga _Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth_, which is filled with cute bunnies. This page is just one of the many examples.
-   The Pokémon Buneary, Azumarill, Bunnelby, Scorbunny and Lopunny to an extent. Averted with Diggersby.
-   In _True Love Junai Monogatari_, one of the items in the Hidden Shop is a rabbit pendant. You should buy it if you want to romance Remi Himekawa, who will ask for it if she sees it.
-   _Power Pete_: The Fuzzy Bunnies, which escaped from a cage in the Stuffed Animal Zoo (which is in the Doll Department of the Toy Mart) and scattered throughout the store, prompting the title character to escape from his packaging and set off to round them back up and return them to their proper place.
-   _Reader Rabbit_: Especially the late 90s redesign.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_: Cream the Rabbit. Polite, shy and kind, it's no wonder that she has a Broken Base in the Sonic fandom — one faction loves her for her Moe qualities, while the other doesn't like how she ranks the cutesy factor off the charts.
-   _The Legendary Starfy_: There's an entire SPECIES of them on Planet Bunnera. They even have magical shapeshifting powers!
-   In _Ensemble Stars!_, this is naturally the theme of the unit Ra\*bits, which has a cute, sailor-suited, youthful look. Nazuna in particular is associated with bunnies - the kanji in his surname means 'two rabbits' (he even draws them as bunnies in his signature) and he has pet rabbits at home - and he is often called cute by the other characters, much to his irritation given that he is a third year and would rather be treated as a Big Brother Mentor.
-   The Mascot Mook for the _World of Mana_ is a small, yellow, limbless lagomorph known as a Rabite. While adorable beyond measure, they are usually newbie fodder and don't pose much of a threat... so long as their fur isn't colored black.
-   _Snuggle_: There's Snuggle himself, the rabbit with big eyes who always makes cutesy facial expressions.
-   A bunny mask serves to help indicate Neon Violet from _Neon White_ as a cutesy, upbeat, childish girl, in contrast to Neon White's demonic mask.
-   The _Galaxy Angel_ gameverse has space rabbits aboard the Elsior, which Vanilla often plays with. She even adopts one for herself though it sadly dies of old age, leaving her heartbroken.
-   Bianca from the _Spyro the Dragon_ series is a rabbit mage who is considered quite cute by the other characters. In her first appearance in _Spyro: Year of the Dragon_, she does try to present herself as a Hair Riasing Hare, but instead comes off as Endearing Dorky, thanks to her status as a Minion with an F in Evil. Particularly noticable is halfway through the Evening Lake worlds, where she undergoes a Heel–Face Turn with accompanying Good Costume Switch, part of the change being taking down her hood to show off her rabbit ears, presumably to make her look cuter to the viewers.

    Webcomics 

-   In _AntiBunny_ at least 90% of the cast are bunnies.
-   _Blade Bunny_ - The title character has bunny ears. Why? It makes her look cute. And her name is Bunny.
-   In _Penny and Aggie_, when Sara gushes over how "cuuuuute" she finds the title characters as a couple, dancing bunny faces appear around her head.
-   A rare dramatic example in _El Goonish Shive_. At one point late into a story arc Susan angsts majorly and begins to awaken magical powers, which are about to go haywire. Jerry the Immortal manages to cast serenity magic to calm her down, which manifests itself as cute, fluffy animals surrounding her, two of which are bunnies.
-   The whole point of _Scenes from a Multiverse_'s Bunnies Planet, in the Zones of Adorable.
-   In _Unfamiliar_, Planchette has a cute bunny familiar named Winston, who’s as adorable as he is a Deadpan Snarker.
-   Some _xkcd_ characters prefer to call them "buns". This comic has Cueball applying for a grant to introduce the pygmy rabbit to the eastern US — but not for any practical reason, just because they're adorable.

    Web Original 

    Western Animation

-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Fluttershy, to emphasize her shy cuteness, has a pet rabbit (named Angel, no less), although he doesn't always act cute and cuddly. She also mentions "cute bunnies" in one of her songs.
-   Subverted (in a non-Hair-Raising Hare way) in the _South Park_ episode "Pip" (parodying _Great Expectations_). Pip tries to prove to Estella that she is not an unfeeling monster, because an unfeeling monster wouldn't hurt a cute little bunny rabbit (which Pip pulls from Hammerspace).
    
    ESTELLA: I told you, Pip. I have no heart.
    
    PIP: But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all! Look at this adorable little bunny.
    
    ESTELLA: Oh my. 'E's very cute.
    
    PIP: You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck. _Estella breaks its neck_ ...Oh. But look at _this_ bunny. There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies._Estella kills bunny #2_...Right...
    
    -   Estella ends up stopping at 25 baby bunnies. Not because she felt bad, mind you, but because she got _bored_... and Pip takes that as evidence that she's got a heart.
-   _Winx Club_: Bloom's kawaii pet rabbit Kiko is an example.
-   The _ChalkZone_ episode "Chocolate Brunch" has Snap finding some Easter eggs he was going to eat with Blocky, and chocolate bunnies end up hatching from the eggs. While Snap still wants to eat them, Blocky refuses as the bunnies are too cute. Eventually, Snap gives in due to their cuteness.

-   As noted under Literature, subverted by _Watership Down_. While rightfully considered a classic of animated film, it has traumatized no small number of children since it's release in 1978 because of misinformed parents sitting them down to watch the movie about the cute, adorable bun—OOOOOHMYGOOOOD!
-   One of the characters in the 1980's version of _Strawberry Shortcake_ was an adorable bunny named Hopsalot.
-   The 1991 direct-to-video film _Timmy's Gift_ by Precious Moments stars a young angel named Timmy, who's following a light from Heaven. Throughout the film, he encounters various talking animals.
