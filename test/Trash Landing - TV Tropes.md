_"Ah, nice and soft garbage bags. Nothing hard or jagged is ever in one of those."_

Someone's long fall is broken by an open dumpster full of garbage bags or an open heaping trash pile. The trash will usually be softer than anything else in the immediate vicinity — you'd think there's a high chance of broken glass or sharp metal objects in there, but this is hardly ever a problem... maybe fictional people are better at wrapping it in cardboard.

Sometimes the trash just happens to be there, which is a lucky break if the person falling wanted to live. People Driven to Suicide who land in one of these will likely be unhappy about the Unwanted Rescue.

Sometimes, the person doing the falling aimed for the trash.

When the character picks themselves up, there is a good chance they will stop to remove debris or food from their clothing. More often than not includes a banana peel. For large trash piles, they might not need to stop — trash will fall off their clothes as they move. Bonus points if someone tries eating items from the trash.

Another common variation, limited solely to comic uses, generally to kids' shows and mostly to people who really deserve it, is the big-ol' pile of horsesh... er, manure.

May serve as a way for our heroes to end up Down in the Dumps.

Compare Dumpster Dive, where the character deliberately enters a garbage pile to retrieve something and Slipping into Stink, for a short fall (as in falling over, not falling from the sky) into something gross. Also see Living Crashpad and Car Cushion.

**Note:** This is a very risky stunt, and unless the only alternative is certain death, it would be best to think twice about doing this in real life. At the very least, you'll almost certainly break bones and, given what people throw away, are likely to get multiply stabbed and injected with garbage and garbage juice. (The manure pile, while disgusting, is also less likely to kill you, assuming you don't land wrong — but still, don't try it unless there's no alternative.)

    Literature 

-   Spider Robinson's _Callahan's Lady_ includes a short story with a villainess with some Applied Phlebotinum that forces the characters to do anything she asks them to.

It could have been worse though — the rubbish pipe ends at an incinerator, and had luck not been with them, they would have been burned alive!
-   _Discworld_: When Moist von Lipwig jumps from the window in _Going Postal_ he lands in manure. This causes him to think, "On the positive side, this meant that he had fallen into something soft. On the negative side, this meant that he had fallen into something soft."

-   In the _Chuck_ episode "Chuck Versus the Marlin", Sarah and a Fulcrom agent fight on a rooftop. Chuck arrives just in time to see them both go over the edge, but running to the edge he discovers that they landed safely in a dumpster.
-   _CSI_ has an episode where a liquor store robber jumped out a window and into a dumpster to escape the cops, but in a subversion of the Soft Glass trope, the window glass cut into his neck and killed him.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   In "Inferno", the detached TARDIS console drops the Doctor into a rubbish tip at the story's conclusion.
    -   In "Survival", the Doctor is thrown from the explosion when neither he nor the guy he's playing motorcycle-chicken with swerves in time. He lands face first (and arse up) in a pile of rubbish someone was nice enough to leave lying in an abandoned field.
    -   "Boom Town": Blon Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen's emergency teleporter allowed her to escape 10 Downing Street, unlike the rest of her family — but she wound up in a skip on the Isle of Dogs.

-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_:
    -   _Daredevil (2015)_: The episode "Cut Man" opens with a seriously wounded Daredevil being found in a dumpster. He'd been ambushed but was able to escape, and presumably fell into the dumpster while fleeing across rooftops. Later a criminal comes looking for him and gets captured by Daredevil who does a High-Altitude Interrogation, then drops him into the same dumpster.
    -   Invoked in _Jessica Jones (2015)_. Kilgrave has told Will Simpson to jump off a building, so Jessica saves him by knocking him out, dragging him down to the alley beneath the building, and dropping him in a dumpster. When he wakes up, she tells him that he jumped off the building and landed in the dumpster. Since Simpson believes he fulfilled Kilgrave's command, the compulsion to jump goes away.
-   Tested by the _MythBusters_ — if you're _certain_ there's nothing dangerous under that top layer of trash, it's doable. Their "best case" setup assumed a dumpster used by a mattress factory and thus full of foam scrap; it did a better job of cushioning Buster's (and later Adam's) fall than the regulation stunt airbag.
    -   However, on the flip side (and the main factor working against this trope's practicality), if you're _not_ absolutely sure that the dumpster's safe, it probably isn't. When the Mythbusters went to a waste disposal facility to look through dumpsters, they noted that the three that they selected at random to look at had items like medical waste, rebar and wood slats, which would likely severely injure anyone jumping into the dumpster. The expert they talked to backed up those findings, noting that dumpsters filled only with soft material, such as the mattress factory example above, make up a very, very small percentage of the total garbage received.
-   In an episode of _The Nanny_, Fran agrees to go out with a guy whom she had rejected in High School. Then he asks her to marry him or else he will jump out of a window and kill himself.

-   An episode of _NCIS: Los Angeles_ has Hetty, of all people, sneak out of a locked-down building this way. After landing in the dumpster, she lays still for a few seconds, having the wind knocked out of her, but seems fine otherwise. She does mention that she's getting old.
-   _Person of Interest_ had a more sensible version when a man does a Destination Defenestration into a crate of styrofoam packing pellets. Even then he's stunned for several minutes (and would probably have broken his neck smashing through the plate glass).
-   Recycled In Space with _Quark_, a short-lived sci-fi comedy about a spaceship whose job is to pick up garbage. In the final episode, the captain is subject to Dramatic Space Drifting when the computer goes homicidal and strands him outside the spaceship. Quark is able to release the garbage loading chute and drop inside.
-   _Roswell_: In "The Morning After", this is the way Max and Michael get out of the Sheriff's office. Granted, it was a two stories fall and there was nowhere else to land but the dumpster.
-   _Scrubs_: Ted accidentally falls off the hospital roof after being startled (while contemplating suicide). He is saved by landing on a pile of garbage bags that the Almighty Janitor and his sidekick had been hiding on a lower roof as part of a money-making scheme.
-   Like in _L&O SVU_ above, in _The X-Files_ episode "Essence" a foe falls off a roof while fighting Mulder and Scully. He seems to land safely in a garbage truck... but then the compactor is activated.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   This trope can occasionally be seen being played straight on wrestling whenever there's a backstage brawl. One example is when The Undertaker had Hulk Hogan tied to the back of his motorcycle and was dragging him around backstage only for Hogan to go crashing into a pile of empty cardboard boxes, while the announcers played up how painful that apparently would be.

-   Naegi in _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_ at the end of the fifth trial drops several stories (depending on how many levels down the trial room is) into the school's trash dump without any complication, despite falling headfirst next to a solidly-built desk and chair. Some hours later Kirigiri does the same thing, with a cup of ramen stuck to her head as the only consequence. Later on, the two of them make it back to the first floor on a ladder that takes them roughly half an hour to climb.
-   _Deltarune_: In Chapter 2, after the boss fight with Berdly on the rollercoaster, the main trio are launched off the unfinished track, but escape more or less unharmed by landing in a garbage pile at the Cyber World trash dump.
-   In _Dying Light_, hero Kyle Crane uses trash piles to break his fall. At one point he wonders if he'll ever land on one full of rusty knives.
-   Played straight by accident in the _Left 4 Dead_ games. Several spots with drops and windows have trash bags just high enough to prevent fall damage if the player lands on them. One of them in the second map of "No Mercy" is part of a meta strategy in Versus mode.

-   During _The Matrix: Path of Neo_ this is averted during the chase level, you either jump off the balcony and land a few feet away or run down the stairs.
-   In the video game adaptation of _Men in Black_, near the beginning, you're being fired upon while descending a building's fire escape. You can't descend all the way down because you'll die before the enemies get within the range of your weapons, so your only choice is to leap down into the dumpster.
-   At the beginning of _Perfect Dark Zero_'s Rooftops Escape mission, Jack conveniently lands in a trash bin after being knocked off the rooftops.
-   In _Resident Evil 4_, Leon and Ashley escape from a part of Saddler's island compound by jumping down a trash chute, and come out no worse for the wear. The same chute can be used to dispose of a few Militia Ganados with a crane beforehand, but all bets are off as to whether they die when tossed down it or just move off after landing.
-   _SPY Fox_ does this in the opening cutscene of _Cheese Chase_. The stunt seems to have been planned out, as seconds later the dumpster collapses to reveal Fox ready for action on his SPY Scooter.
-   In _Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose!_, if Buster loses a life, he will sometimes fall into a dumpster.
-   _Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego? (1997)_ ends with Carmen doing this when escaping from ACME headquarters. The dumpster she lands in transforms into a car, but one of the characters holds it in place before she can use it. The scene then cuts to Carmen in a cell behind laser bars, and the credits roll.
-   _XenoGears_: To infiltrate Solaris's main base, Fei, Elly, and Citan enter through the garbage deposal facility by getting sucked by the trash carrier before landing on even more trash on an upper level.
-   _Yandere Simulator_: Yan-chan can position a dumpster just so, so that a student she pushes off the roof will land in it. The reason for doing this is that it makes it possible to hide the body by covering it up with more trash.
