**Archie:** But why the heck are we playing seniors in the show? I mean, we're juniors in real life.  
**Kevin:** Well, senior year is just so much more kickin' for the storyline. Teens on the cusp of the rest of their lives.

The last year of High School is ripe for drama. Instead of being naïve freshmen or complacent sophomores, seniors have graduation looming over their heads and are thus under more pressure. This trope encompasses the struggles students experience in their last year of high school.

Going off to college is the biggest issue — middle-class and rich students are panicking about getting into (often prestigious) schools, which may conflict with characters who are resigned to entering the workforce after graduating. Characters who were previously aimless in previous years now have to get their act together, as a Graduation for Everyone ending is not guaranteed. Many countries also conduct university entrance exams which seniors must study for long in advance. University often means that the high school friend group is breaking up, and characters may struggle with the possibility of being apart from their friends, high school boyfriends/girlfriends, and family.

Because of this major upcoming change, seniors also end up nostalgic. Barring the New Transfer Student, they've spent the last couple of years in this school and will surely miss it, so major school events are now much more important. There will be a lot of emphasis on the last big sports game, as well as dances like prom and homecoming. Any "Last Day of School" Plot focusing on seniors just about to graduate will likely be filled with mayhem. The work may or may not have a High School Rocks vibe depending on how much the characters enjoyed their school experience.

Insecurity and uncertainty about _college_ graduation is a similar, albeit less common, beast. In this case, the conflict will be about the expectation of becoming fully-fledged adults after graduation, and characters will struggle to find jobs or grad school programs. Still, these stories share similar themes about leaving a school and a group of friends behind.

Note that not every story with a senior year cast qualifies for this trope. There must be an emphasis on graduation and what comes after it.

The Coming of Age Story is often set in senior year for this reason: it's a very transient and change-filled time that has a lot of dramatic potential. This often overlaps with Bittersweet 17 as many seniors are about that age. Growing Up Sucks might be a factor as well. Contrast First Day of School Episode, Graduate from the Story, where graduation writes seniors out of the plot and the story continues without them, Freshman Fears, which portrays students at their first year at a secondary or tertiary school having struggles or fears, and Second Year Protagonist, which puts the protagonist in a middle year to avoid senior year stress.
