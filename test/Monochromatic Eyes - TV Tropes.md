**Victim:** Uh... about your eyes, sir, did you injure them?  
**Jei:** _They merely reflect one whose soul has been touched by the Gods._

In Real Life, some people have different colored irises, but what they can't have is a pupil, iris and sclera be the same color. In fiction, however, this isn't an issue, and you can get characters with eyes that have only one color.

This trope is used to highlight the unnatural and the alien in a work. One common application is Mind-Control Eyes. In some anime and manga, Blank White Eyes are used to indicate shock. In speculative fiction, Prophet Eyes are used to indicate prescience or clairvoyance.

Many modern comic books have superheroes' eyes turn pure white while wearing masks. Apparently, this is to make them look more "disguised" than they would with just their (normally pretty flimsy) half-masks. This does, however, have the drawback of dehumanizing them in the eyes of some fans. Blank eyes coupled with Glowing Eyes of Doom usually indicate that someone is using his/her power (e.g. spellcasting) or about to.

Specific subtropes include Black Eyes of Evil (pure black eyes indicating that serious evil is present) and Red Eyes, Take Warning (pure red eyes means something really bad is going to happen).

    Anime and Manga 

-   _D.Gray-Man_:
    -   General Winters Socalo has completely white eyes. This serves to enhance that fact that he is Ax-Crazy.
    -   Skin Bolic as well. Interestingly he didn't have them prior to his Noah awakening which means he gained those while losing his sanity under the influence of the Noah memory.
-   In earlier adaptations of _Cyborg 009_, Albert Heinrich (Cyborg 004) has white eyes with no irises or pupils. In the 2001 anime series, his eyes have light blue sclera and dark blue irises with no pupils.
-   _Dragon Ball_: Several aliens are drawn with entirely red eyes, like the Saiyan Great Apes, Burter, and Cooler's final transformation. Broly is also notable for always being drawn with Blank White Eyes as a Legendary Super Saiyan, emphasizing his Berserker status. In _Dragon Ball GT_, Baby starts out with pupiled white eyes but develops reflective, solid blue eyes that look more like lenses as he develops.
-   _Godzilla: Singular Point_: Salunga possesses blank white eyes.
-   Several _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ characters have this, including Japan, Norway, and Liechtenstein.
    -   Also, Turkey's eyes are white with his mask.
-   Although he always wears a mask, Meta Knight from _Kirby: Right Back at Ya!_ usually seems to have yellow eyes. His eye color changes with his emotional state, but it's always a single color (although it does phase between two or three colors on occasion). In the games, he has solid white eyes when unmasked though from _Kirby: Planet Robobot_ onwards, his eyes are yellow with or without the mask.
-   In _Lyrical Nanoha_, performing a Unison with either Reinforce gives you solid blue eyes. Reinforce Zwei herself also has solid blue eyes.
-   A couple characters in _Naruto_ are drawn this way (not counting ones that may just have black iris which don't stick out from their pupils), including Gaara, Ino, Kakuzu, Karin, and Kurotuchi.
    -   The Byakugan of the Hyuga clan comes pretty close to monochromatic. The iris and sclera are both white, but just barely different enough shades to be distinguishable. The pupil, on the other hand, blends in completely with the iris.
-   This is used for characters in the future of _Now and Then, Here and There._ No explanation was offered about why they all have it, except for Abelia.
-   Most ordinary residents of Tokyo/New Townsville from _Powerpuff Girls Z_ have solid eye colors.
-   Cheza the Flower Maiden from _Wolf's Rain_ has wholly red eyes. You can see the different parts, because there are darker areas, but no other colours. One creator interview explains that they first considered just red irises, but that had been done before, and they wanted her to look not-so-human.

    Comic Books 

-   _Black Moon Chronicles_: Haazheel Thorn has some pretty scary eyes, as he lacks pupils. This is just one hint that he's only half-human.
-   Concrete's eyes go completely black when he uses his "night vision", but otherwise look "human" despite their inhuman vision. He squicks out a kid out trying to show them off.
    
    **Concrete:** I have owl eyes when I want 'em. See?  
    **Boy:** EUHHH! Change 'em back!
    
-   _New Gods_: Darkseid has solid red eyes. Depending on the Author, when looking very, very close, he actually has barely-distinct square-irises similar to those of Galactus.

-   Essence from _Red Hood and the Outlaws_ has solid black eyes.
-   _Relative Heroes_ antagonists Kittyhawk and Napalm have solid white eyes.
-   Lord Morpheus from _The Sandman (1989)_ has starfield eyes, although usually they're depicted as pure black.
-   Johnny Alpha of _Strontium Dog_ has pure white eyes, because he's a mutant.
-   Starfire of _Teen Titans_ has solid green eyes. Her animated counterpart has green irises and green-tinted whites. Her eyes do turn to a monochromatic glowing green when she uses her powers, however.
-   Jei-san of _Usagi Yojimbo_ and anyone he "possesses".
-   _Watchmen_: Dr. Manhattan has white eyes with no visible pupils.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_:
        -   The somewhat inconstant coloring of Golden Age comics results in Queen Atomia being depicted with solid green eyes which give her an even more inhuman appearance—mostly in smaller panels—though it's clear she's meant to have a thin slit pupil splitting the poisonous green.
        -   The Gremlins (which are extraterrestiral) have large solidly dark blue to black eyes.
    -   _Wonder Woman (2006)_: The Gargareans have solid milky white eyes, as they are an army of the dead their eyes are made to resemble those of the dead whose eyes end up with a milky film under the lens.
-   _X-Men_:

    -   Storm has eyes that turn solid white when she uses her powers.

    Fan Works

-   In _The Keys Stand Alone_, Paul's eyes turn fully golden when he uses his power/magic sight. He was stuck with them that way for a few chapters until Cirelle helped him gain control over them. Also, the wizard Shaamforouz has golden orbs for eyes.
-   In _Life Is Worth Living_ it is explained why the future people from _Now and Then, Here and There_ have monochromatic eyes: Over the years a genetic mutation arose where this showed up and regular-eyed people were driven out of the gene pool. The reason that Abelia has regular eyes is because she was brought into the future from the past.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Brahms: The Boy II_: One night, when Liza is trying to find Brahms' identification number, she shines her flashlight in his face. His eyes go solid white, and he vomits a cloud of bugs in her face, which was just an episode of Liza's.
-   The _Cloverfield_ Monster has completely black eyes. This was deliberately chosen to evoke Great White Sharks.
-   Godzilla in _Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack!_ has pure-white eyes to indicate that he's the Big Bad of the film. That, and he's also the ''original'' Godzilla resurrected/controlled/fueled by the vengeful spirits of the forgotten soldiers who died in WWII.
-   Pinhead, of _Hellraiser_ fame, is eerie enough with over a hundred nails sticking in his head - but the solid black shark eyes he has make it _worse_.

-   _The Jurassic Dead_: The undead dinosaur's eyes are a solid white.
-   _Kuntilanak_: Sometimes, a characters' eyes will go solid white, which indicates that they're a spirit.
-   In _MirrorMask_, the queen of the city of shadows and Helena, once she is hypnotized and made to be the princess as a replacement for the queen's runaway daughter, who has now taken over Helena's life, have monochromatic black eyes. Helena's eyes turn back to normal once Valentine helps her remember who she really is. The one servant who sees Helena after she has her normal eyes back doesn't seem to notice. Granted, he was far away and the room was dark.
-   MonsterVerse:
    -   Methuselah in _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_ has blank, beady eyes, visible while he's emerging out the ground, and they seem to be glowing ominously.
    -   The Dark Titan Camazotz in the spin-off graphic novel _Kingdom Kong_ appears to be missing one eye, but the other one is milky white and blind.
-   The Spirit of Christmas Past in _The Muppet Christmas Carol_, making it terrifying.

-   _X-Men: Apocalypse_: En Sabah Nur's and Storm's eyes turn white when they actively use their mutant abilities.

    Literature 

-   When the Elimist from _Animorphs_ takes on a humanoid form to speak to the teens, he is described as having eyes that look like a starfield - black with myriad little white dots in the distance.
-   In _Brimstone Angels_, Farideh and her sister Havilar have these, being _Dungeons & Dragons_ tieflings (see Tabletop Games below). Farideh has one solid gold eye, one silver one, while Havilar's are both gold.
-   _The Broken Sword_ by Poul Anderson downplays this: though elves' eyes have pupils, they're "hard to see" and the eyes glow dim blue.
-   Blanc Isolde, _Cerberus High_'s resident frosthound\-canid, has pure white eyes and Mystical White Hair. As a result, he is treated like a unicorn around the school.
-   In Louise Lawrence's post-apocalyptic young adult novel _Children of the Dust_, a mutation arises among the survivors of a nuclear holocaust, resulting in offspring whose eyes are white with black pin-prick pupils. Most animal species, including humans (who are also born with white fur all over their bodies) are affected.
-   The di'Taykan of Tanya Huff's _Confederation of Valor_ have this. Rather than a single discrete pupil and iris their eyes are made up of hundreds of microscopic pupils embedded in a solid, single coloured mass of muscles that widens and shrinks them depending on ambient light conditions and is capable of shutting them completely, giving this appearance.
-   A rule of magic on Discworld is that the eyes are the one thing no-one can magically disguise. Most Discworld gods have some sort of monochromatic eyes, depending on the nature of the deity in question; The Lady has blank emerald green, and Fate has a starfield. Illustrations show the others as having blank golden-white glowing eyes.
    -   Vorbis, the villain of _Small Gods_, has eyes of pure black.
    -   Kaos has all-black eyes that turn silver when he's angry.
    -   Ymper Trymon, when possessed by the Things from the Dungeon Dimensions trying to enter reality through his head, had eyes that were holes into blankness.
    -   Coin the Sourceror had many-faceted eyes of solid gold colour.
-   _The Doorway and the Deep_: Nash's eyes go solid white whenever he uses his keen, which allows him to see long distances, making him an excellent look-out.
-   The Fremen in _Dune_ have all-blue eyes. It's a sign of long-term Melange consumption.
-   Ursula K. Le Guin has used this trope a couple of times in her _Hainish_ novels. In _City of Illusions_, Falk has yellow irises that fill the whole visible part of his eyes, indicating that he comes from another planet. In _Four Ways to Forgiveness_ Havzhiva, a Hainishman, is practically the only person on Yeowe whose eyes _aren't_ monochromatic. His lover finds them exotic, as you'd expect.
-   The Star-Eyed Goddess of the Shin'a'in in Mercedes Lackey's _Heralds of Valdemar_ series, as her name suggests, appears as a woman with starfield eyes.
-   The elves of Michael Stackpole's novel _Fortress Draconis_ and its sequels have Monochromatic Eyes, usually in metallic colors, as juveniles. Since elves are immortal, they gain adulthood status (and regular eyes) through a ceremony, and the inability of a group of elves to do this because their island is in enemy hands is a plot point.
-   In David Eddings' _Malloreon_, the protagonists keep running into ambushes set by one particular villain, Naradas. They know it's always the same guy because witnesses and captured enemies always described the same way; his eyes are pure white, with only pupil being anything other than white.
-   In _Percy Jackson and the Olympians,_ Briares has monochromatic brown eyes.
    -   Kronos (possessing Luke) has creepy golden eyes.
-   In one of Stephen King's short stories, "The Man in The Black Suit", a boy out fishing in the forest meets the Devil. Among his other inhuman attributes, said Devil had eyes that lacked irises, pupils and whites. Instead they were completely orange like the flickering flames dancing in a stove.
-   In the Star Trek Expanded Universe novels, the Damiani race have eyes of solid white or silver, while Seleneans have monochromatic green eyes.
-   Arkanians, of the Star Wars Expanded Universe, have pure white eyes. Chiss, on the other hand, have glowing red eyes - it's never mentioned in The Thrawn Trilogy if they're solid red or just the iris, but Pellaeon is never able to read his admiral, although in Outbound Flight Car'das can see Thrawn's gaze shifting from one thing to another. The cover to one of the Hand of Thrawn books seemed to hint that there are whites to Thrawn's eyes, even if they're not white, but the comic books and other visual depictions always make the eyes solid red.
    -   Flim used "self-powered surface inserts" to simulate this when impersonating Thrawn.
-   Jorenians, from the _Stardoc_ universe, have solid white eyes. In _Blade Dancer_, Jory—a Terran/Jorenian hybrid—has solid _green_ eyes. No reason is given for this.

    Live Action TV 

-   _Carnivàle_:
    -   Brother Justin Crowe, whose eyes go completely black when he's feeling especially demonic.
    -   As do Sofie's.
-   John Locke had one black eye and one white eye in a dream sequence in _Lost_.
-   _Grimm_: A Grimm's eyes appear the deepest possible black but only to Wessen.
-   Data (Brent Spiner) from _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ as an android has completely yellow eyes with a small dot of a pupil. Referenced by Spiner when he released a musical album entitled "Ol' Yellow Eyes is back".
    -   A better example is Geordi (while still wearing the VISOR), whose eyes were entirely white due to a birth defect.
-   Meg and Ruby and Sam, as of Season 4's finale have black eyes in _Supernatural_; Lilith's eyes are white. Oddly enough, the Yellow-Eyed Demon—Azazel—only gets yellow irises.
    -   To indicate different ranks, maybe? All of the lower level demons have black eyes, but of the demons with different eye colours - Azazel (yellow), Alastair and Lilith (white), the Crossroads demon (red) - Azazel, Alastair and Lilith are all much more powerful than than your standard Mook. The Crossroads demon wasn't particularly hard to kill, but has a special job and therefore a different 'paygrade'?

    Music 

    Pinball 

-   Seen on the alien leaders in _Firepower_

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Common in 4<sup>th</sup> edition races. They appear on the eladrin, an elf variant with an extra-strong connection to the Feywild; tieflings, diabolically tainted descendants of an empire-wide Deal with the Devil; the Noble Savage Goliaths; and the reincarnating, Semi-Divine Deva.
    -   Some depictions give the Drow elves solid red or white eyes to accentuate their Always Chaotic Evil status.
    -   Metallic and red dragons' eyes slowly become monochromatic as they age. The pattern goes: silver for silver dragons, gold for gold dragons, green for bronze dragons, aqua or teal for copper dragons, a sort of off-gold for brass dragons, and glowing red-orange for red dragons.
    -   The default form of changelings from _Eberron_ usually have them sport colorless or blank white eyes.
-   When _Magic: The Gathering_'s fairy-tale world Lorwyn is transformed into the dark and gloomy Shadowmoor, the kithkin's eyes grow huge, lose their pupils, and glow faintly gold. It symbolizes the Hobbit Expies' change from slightly superstitious rustic folk with empathic powers to paranoid castle-dwellers with a full-blown hive mind.
-   Downplayed by _Pathfinder_ elves: they have very large, shiny irises, which make their eyes look monochromatic and come across as disconcertingly alien to observers.
-   The elves in _RuneQuest_ have monochrome eyes. They're actually humanoid plants.

    Video Games 

-   Mephisto, the Big Bad of _Alundra 2_, has a pair of these.
-   _BARK (2022)_: The puppy's owner is shown with solid white, angry eyes. This is meant to make him look scarier in the dog's eyes.
-   _Basingstoke_: All of the characters in the game have their eyes as one solid colour.
-   The player character(s) in the _Blood_ series have all-red eyes, likely related to their service to Tchernobog prior to the first game.
-   The Player Character of _Buddy 2016_ has these, as does a giant Monster Clown.
-   _Burger & Frights_: The bloody woman you see throughout the game has solid white eyes.
-   _Claws of Furry_: All four cat ninjas have these.
-   In _Dark Souls II_, the player character's eyes become completely white in Hollow form.
-   War from _Darksiders_ has these ones.
-   In _Delta Rune_ Seam's left eye is a black orb and his right eye is a orange button.
-   In _Don't Starve_, it's a common trait among some characters to have solid white eyes. The only exceptions are Wickerbottom's Black Bead Eyes and Woodie, Warly, Webber, Wilbur, and Woodlegs which are all males with solid white eyes.
-   Fubuki from _Disgaea 2_ has eyes that are completely white. Incidentally, they're not because of his supernatural nature (he's a demon, but so is everyone else in the game), but because his eyes were severely damaged when he was young, making him blind.
    -   One of the defining characteristics of Majins and its expys (besides their jacked-up stats) in any Nippon Ichi game are their monochromatic eyes. Lord Zetta, whose appearance also resembles Disgaea's Majins, has white, iris-less eyes. Interestingly, his offspring Petta has white irises.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   Some Bosmer (Wood Elves) in the series have all-black eyes, while some Dunmer (Dark Elves) have all-red eyes.
    -   Sheogorath, the Daedric Prince of Madness, has variously appeared either with all-green eyes or with cat-like eyes. Given that all Daedric Princes are shapeshifters who can choose to manifest in whatever form they like, this is rather justified.
    -   Characters who have been resurrected using the Staff of Worms have all-black eyes.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   _Final Fantasy IV_: Most illustrations of Cecil Harvey as a Dark Knight give him a helmet with solid white eyes.
    -   Many of the animals and monsters in _Final Fantasy XIV_ have a singular eye color. Aside from human enemies, the number of enemies that avert the trope are exceedingly rare.
-   _Ginger Beyond The Crystal_: If you look closely at the druids' eyes, you'll see that they're solid yellow.
-   In _Ian's Eyes_, all the zombies have these.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_ - In his One-Winged Angel form, Ansem's eyes turn completely orange, with paler spots where his irises should be.
-   _Left 4 Dead_'s zombies have all white eyes. This is partly because it's creepy, but mostly because it takes less computing power to render all white eyes than actual eyes.
-   Fi from _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_ has them in a pretty shade of blue, matching pretty much the entire rest of her body.
-   Several characters both masked and unmasked from _Mortal Kombat_ have the white variant of these. Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Raiden, Shinnok, etc.
    -   In _Mortal Kombat X_, the revenants who are under Quan Chi's control (except for Scorpion, who still has the white variant) have a golden-red variant of these. In the same game, Raiden (combined with his Evil Costume Switch, which is black) gets a reddish-orange version of monochromatic eyes after he purifies the Jinsei and absorbs its corruption.

-   The raptors trying to eat the soldier in _1916 - Der Unbekannte Krieg_ have solid white eyes.
-   Kreia of _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_ has monochromatic white eyes, which become monochromatic black in her Sith form. She tells the player character that they look that way because she doesn't use them, preferring to see with the Force. Apparently she _could_ restore her sight, she just doesn't want to since, as we all know, Your Eyes Can Deceive You.
-   In _Mass Effect_, Asari eyes turn solid black when they're mind-melding.
-   _Metroid_:
    -   _Metroid Prime 3: Corruption_ has Samus, in her highest state of Phazon corruption. You can see her clear bluish-white eyes reflected faintly in the scan visor, complete with non-glowing Tron Lines running down her face.
    -   _Metroid Fusion_ also has the SA-X's completely white eyes. You only get a very quick close-up to see this when the player first sees the SA-X.
-   Nue Houjuu and, if you peer closely at her portraits, Patchouli Knowledge from _Touhou Project_.
    -   Due to Alphes' drawing style, most of the girls in _Immaterial and Missing Power_ had these. It seems to have been averted for _Scarlet Weather Rhapsody_, though.
-   _Pankapu_: Pankapu has solid light blue eyes.
-   _Prayer of the Faithless_: The monochrome version of Color-Coded Characters of Aeyr and Mia on the Start Screen have pure red and blue eyes, respectively.
-   _The Prince of Landis_: The Guest who crash-landed on Earth has eyes that are a solid green colour.
-   The blarg alien species from _Ratchet & Clank_ all have all yellow or all orangish eyes. Chairman Drek on the other hand has all blue eyes- a very luminous blue at that.
-   _Shantae and the Seven Sirens_: The Empress Siren's eyes are a pure blue, making her look more inhuman, and therefore villainous, than any other siren, who all have pupils and scalerae.
-   Aliens in _The Sims 2_ have shiny black eyes.
-   One of the entities pursuing you in _Smile_ has solid white eyes.
-   M. Bison and Dhalsim from _Street Fighter_ are like this in most incarnations (although unlike the others, Dhalsim isn't a villain). In all games after _Street Fighter II_, Sagat's eye (that isn't covered) is entirely white.
    -   Akuma/Gouki also has these sometimes.
    -   Gen, Rolento, and Hakan also have solid white eyes. Other characters with solid colored eyes are Necro (yellow) and Oro (red). However, Twelve averts this trope. He appears to have solid black eyes, but they're suppose to be empty eye sockets... and _then_ you'll realize that he actually has eyes with red irises hidden within those sockets in his _Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike_ ending.
-   _World of Warcraft_:
    -   Draenei, a very holy race, have blue glowing eyes.
    -   Night elves normally have silver or bluish glowing eyes to go with their innate supernatural awareness. Night elves with druidic potential have glowing eyes have "amber" eyes... which are more like yellow or gold glowing eyes.
    -   When the Blood Elves split off from the High Elves, their light blue glowing eyes turned green to reflect their addiction to demonic or arcane magic.
    -   Worgen have monochromatic glowing eyes in a variety of colors. (Or the boys do, at any rate.)
    -   Death Knight characters get glowing monochromatic eyes to match the nasty variety of raw magic that infuses them.

    Web Animation 

-   Coach Z from _Homestar Runner_ has eyes that are pretty much just circles on his face (in fact, in a trailer for Strong Bad's Cool Game For Attractive People, his eyes are _invisible_ on some displays). However, this is nothing new in the Homestar Runner world, seeing as how the title character doesn't even have arms.
-   Bitey from the Brackenwood series is another example.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Charby the Vampirate_, the quickest way to tell the difference between normal vampires and the elite vampires is that the elite vampires have monochromatic eyes while regular vampires have normal eyes.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, the Demonic Duck and Commander Jaguar both have this type of eyes. In the case of the Demonic Duck though, whether the natural state of his eyes is intended to be completely yellow or completely black is not clear.
-   In _Erfworld_, these are extremely common among the residents of the titular setting. Parson, an Earthling who was magically pulled into Erfworld, stands out for having pupils and sclerae; when he starts Going Native, his character design loses the pupils. Some locals, like Caesar and Maggie, have the inexplicable ability to roll their eyes anyway.
-   The masked-with-white-eyes look is popular with both heroes and villains in _Everyday Heroes_.
-   Standard for the characters of _General Protection Fault_.
-   Dimo from _Girl Genius_ has entirely yellow-green eyes. Which apparently glow in the dark. Then again, he _is_ a Jägermonster.
-   A few characters from _Gunnerkrigg Court_. The Regional Fairies start off with Milky White Eyes; upon becoming human, they get grey eyes with pupils that are only visible in extreme close-ups. Ysengrin has beady green eyes, and Reynardine, when assuming wolf-form, has beady yellow eyes.
-   The Trolls of _Homestuck_ all have eyes with yellow-orange scleras (and normal pupils), except for Sollux, who has one completely red eye and one completely blue eye (to match his 3D glasses.)
    -   Terezi's eyes are completely red, again matching her shades. They were originally normal Troll eyes, but turned completely red when she was blinded.
    -   When a character dies, they get Blank White Eyes.
-   The comics set in the Rhymes With Bitch universe in _The KA Mics_ have white "Little Orphan Annie" type eyes. Zog & Sten from Drunk Aliens also have one color eyes.
    -   Aradia Megido had these originally. She got better.
-   Richard in _Looking for Group_ has all-yellow eyes.
-   Magic in _Magical Misfits_ causes magic users to have Monochromatic Eyes.
-   In the webcomic _Polandball_, all characters have pure white eyes.
    -   In fact, on the subreddit, it is against the rules to draw irises of any kind.
-   Some of The Fair Folk have these in _Roommates_ like The Erlkönig, his daughter (dark blue, purple), Dark!Jareth (dark blue), "Odile" (unknown, but light). Also occasionally the Shadow!Cast from _Such Stuff Dreams are Made on_ (Fae magic empowered versions of normally non-magic characters) in ways bordering Mind-Control Eyes.
-   Similarly, the heroine of _Spinnerette_, in homage to the comic book character she's based on.
-   Both the Varn and their Galapados soldiers in _Terinu_ have solid golden eyes.
-   The Aesir and Vanir have these in _Thistil Mistil Kistil_: Thor's are green, Freyr's are yellow, and Odin's one eye is blue.
-   All the gods in _Vanadys: Tales Of A Fallen Goddess_ have eyes that are one solid color (which color it is depends on the god in question). The titular Fallen Goddess generally wears Cool Shades to hide her solid blue eyes.
-   In _Yet Another Fantasy Gamer Comic_ Drow have Monochromatic Eyes (red in coloured panels), true to their _Monster Manual_ description.

    Web Original 

-   _Critical Role_: Zigzagged. Tieflings usually have monochromatic eyes, but while Mollymauk's eyes are entirely red, Jester's magenta eyes do have irises and pupils. This, among other things, hints at the fact that Jester isn't a fullblood tiefling, as her father is a water genasi.
-   _Dad_ combines this with heterochromia. The character of Lazlo appears to be a normal woman, until her eyes open, revealing one to be pure pink and the other pure blue, both lacking irises.
-   The protagonist of _Running with Rats_, Alix Black-Eyes, has eyes that are uniformly black.
-   Some of the mutants in the Whateley Universe. Jericho has all-white eyes and is blind. Ash has all-black eyes.
-   Anyone unfortunate enough to contract a ZALGO infection (somewhat related to the Chtulhu mythos).

    Western Animation 

-   _Ben 10_: Anodites in their true forms have this, as do all of the Plumbers Helpers except Cooper and Pierce.
-   In _ChalkZone_, Snap's eyes are circular, blank, and white.
-   _Final Space_: A lot of celestial entities display this overlapping with Glowing Eyes of Doom: Invictus in both its astral form and released form plus all its hosts who have Mind-Control Eyes, the serpent god Werthrent on Ash's homeworld, most of the Titans including Oreskis, and Phil.
-   Antogone from _Frisky Dingo_, who is possessed by ants.
-   Russel of the Gorillaz always has circular blank white eyes, and 2D's are entirely black.
-   From _Invader Zim_, the Irken race, along with some other alien species.
-   Dick Knubbler invoked this in _Metalocalypse_, when he got robotic eyes to replace the ones he lost in a submarine accident, which are completely green (unless he gets mad).
-   The changelings from _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, both pre- and post-reformation. Pre-reformation, they had blue eyes. Post-reformation, the eye color seems to depend on the changeling, with Thorax and Pharynx having purple eyes, and Ocellus having light blue.
-   _Oh No! It's An Alien Invasion_: The standard Brainling Mooks have eyes that glow a solid bright green.
-   In the 2018 reboot of _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_, Hordak has crimson eyes with no visible irises or pupils. Imp also has light yellow eyes with no visible irises or pupils. Shadow Weaver's eyes are usually shown as white slits, but that's a result of her mask; when it's removed, she has Hellish Pupils instead.
-   The Borgs Cybron, Replicon, Grenader and Lazerette from _Skysurfer Strike Force_.
-   From _Skywhales_ the aliens' eyes turn black when they're about to turn into skywhales.
-   Offay from _Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!_.
-   _Teen Titans (2003)_:
    -   Gizmo appears to have blank white eyes all the time. His pupils only appear in an animation goof in the episode "Car Trouble".
    -   Aqualad from the same series has monochromatic black eyes.
    -   As does Fish Person Gill Girl from _Teen Titans Go!_
    -   Red Star's eyes are constantly a blank green as a result of the experiment that gave him his powers.
    -   While Hot Spot is powered up, his eyes are completely white.
-   _Transformers_:
    -   Autobots and Decepticons have solid blue and red eyes respectively. Justified by being, ya know, robots. Some of them<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  do get pupils in _Transformers: Animated_, as this makes it easier to emote.
    -   _Beast Wars_ went a similar route, with some characters having 'unlit headlight' eyes with kind of a 'pupil' at the center, but most having solid color eyes that extended to their mouths and even facial vents.
    -   Played with in _Transformers: Prime_; some characters have 'unlit headlight' type eyes, while others, such as most of the Autobots, have actual visible eyeballs where the color is in a lit up 'pupil'. Makeshift is only known Cybertronian with blank white optics.

    Real Life 

-   People with severe cataracts sometimes have totally white eyes. If the cataracts are that severe, the person is also blind.
-   There's a congenital Birth Defect that can cause this too, but considering said defect (Anencephaly) tends to kill people it isn't exactly common.
-   Eye tattoo is a process of injection of ink under the conjunctiva, a thin external layer of the eye. It can easily make eyes look completely black, but no other coloring can be solid - iris is a little complicated and the pupil is black because it's simply a hole.
    -   Black sclera contact lenses provide a similar but reversible effect.
-   While not truly "eyes", night vision goggles (which are usually green) can give this effect when turned on(if you look at the back of the lenses).
