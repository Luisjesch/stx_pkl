_"Hi, hi! The more important it is to others, the more it's worth to steal. It's great watching dithered faces!"_

Kleptomania, from the Greek root words _kleptein_ (to steal) and _mania_ (obsession with, madness). In the real world, it's an obsession with collecting or hoarding things (which are typically small items like paperclips or pens, which the sufferer may or may not be even aware they stole) with no regard to any material gain. While it might seem quite mild, it can lead to compulsive shoplifting and is often comorbid with personality disorders, which can make things even worse.

In fiction, it's the trait of a Lovable Rogue and is frequently played for laughs. "Sufferers" tend to outright enjoy the act of theft, steal anything that isn't nailed down (particularly if it's valuable, in contrast to Real Life sufferers), gleefully enjoy the material rewards, and may well be a Karma Houdini for this (compared to actual sufferers of kleptomania, who feel an impulse to steal regardless of the value of the item and often feel guilty afterwards). They are distinguished from other thief-related tropes by the fact that they steal for the pleasure of stealing and frequently have trouble leaving something valuable be. They may or may not be outright described as suffering from kleptomania. Sympathetic characters are often Mr. Vice Guy.

In the animal realm, this is a trait of packrats, ferrets, monkeys, and some birds, most famously magpies.

Compare For the Evulz. Characters who might have this trait include the Lovable Rogue, the Gentleman Thief (particularly if they do it out of boredom), and the Token Evil Teammate. They are often an Impossible Thief. The Kleptomaniac Hero is given this trait by the player's own actions (which may be lampshaded as this trope) but not necessarily characterized as such. This character may make liberal use of their Five-Finger Discount card. See also Sleight of Handiness.

You know they've met their match when you hear the words "Oi! Give Me Back My Wallet!"

Also not be confused with a certain Stand, or the The Rolling Stones' album it references either. See Thieving Pet for the animal version of this trope.

    Literature

-   Anne Meredith from _Cards on the Table_ is a known thief who committed murder after her employer discovered her stealing habits.
-   Alton the butler from _Lord Edgware Dies_ discovered the victim's body and did not report it immediately. Instead, he saw it as an opportunity to steal cash that was lying about nearby.
-   Played with in _Hickory Dickory Dock_, when it seems there's one of these at large in a student boarding house. Not only was Celia actually faking to get the attention of a psychiatry student she's in love with, but she was actually given the idea by a fellow lodger... who turns out to be the accomplice of a third resident who is a smuggler and used Celia's faked condition to disguise the creeping around he had to do in the course of his activities.

-   _Discworld_:
    -   Moist von Lipwig — it's a Running Gag that he keeps stealing Drumknott's pencil and certain samples of paper.
    -   Nobby Nobbs. _Thud!_ brings up the problem of why Nobby is allowed to be on the City Watch despite his thieving ways. It's because he's an old friend of Sam Vimes, he seldom steals anything of value, and (like Fred Colon) has a keen ability to read the mood on the streets as well as his ability to sneak around where the (worse) criminals can't see him. Nobby's ability to steal without being seen has also come in handy a few times and is part of the reason he is still employed.
    -   The Nac Mac Feegle are an entire race of people with a deep and abiding love of stealing (and drinking, and fighting, preferably all at the same time).

-   In _The Iron Teeth_, goblins don't _steal_. Humans are just really touchy about people rescuing shinies they leave lying around.
-   The eponymous Locke Lamora, of _The Lies of Locke Lamora_, once had it said about him that "if he had a bloody gash across his throat and a physiker was trying to sew it up, Lamora would steal the needle and thread and die laughing. He... steals _too much._" Lamora was 5 years old at the time.
-   Jeremy Koji in _The Mental State_ is an inmate who suffers from kleptomania. The main character actually weaponizes this as part of a complicated plan to maintain indefinite control over the prison populace and infiltrate the primary antagonist's organisation. By the end of the story, Jeremy is completely cured of his condition, as his new life as a police informant is more than exciting enough to fill the void that was bothering him.
-   In the second era of the _Mistborn_ series, Wayne, the PTSD-suffering sidekick of Wax, will frequently steal small items. Sometimes he does it for a specific purpose, sometimes for no apparent reason. He always leaves something in exchange, though, but the value is not always similar. Wayne insists that he is trading, even if the value is completely disproportional, i.e. stealing a ludicrously expensive aluminum gun from the police and leaving a drawing of it in its place or in the inverse case, stealing a minor item and leaving an aluminium bullet behind.
    -   It gets to the point when the heroes discover that a certain Artifact of Doom was stolen, they immediately stare at him out of habit, even though he'd never entered the vault before. Turns out that he did steal the artifact, but didn't realize what it was. The real treasure was never inside the vault, instead hidden as part of a statue at the entrance. Wayne lifted it (this time without replacement because the building was abandoned), thinking it was an expensive chunk of solid aluminum.

-   _So This is Ever After_: Lila is a thief who's cheerfully, unapologetically kleptomaniacal, constantly stealing things wherever she goes. She met Arek and Matt through stealing from them.
-   The main character of Mary Anderson's book, _Step On a Crack_ suffers from an odd sort of kleptomania where she feels compelled to steal certain items over and over in conjunction with nightmares and occasional fugue states. All of her problems stem from repressed memories of her real mother.
-   _Villains by Necessity_: Arcie is the former leader of the (now defunct) Thieves Guild and pockets everything he comes across, even if they happen to be owned by his traveling companions.
-   Played for Drama (a small amount of drama) in the X-Wing Series novel _Wraith Squadron_. A bit character who interviews to join the eponymous squadron is rejected when he, apparently compulsorily, swipes a framed picture from the commander's desk. (It's mentioned that he is facing charges for several other equally petty thefts, but is confident he'll be cleared.)

    Live-Action TV 

-   An episode of _ALF_ dealt with this when one of Tanner's neighbors is revealed to be a kleptomaniac. Alf caught her stealing some of the family's jewelry and confronted her son, who he had become friends with, and he had to explain that his mother simply couldn't help it.

-   _Breaking Bad_: Marie has the compulsive urge to steal small objects from stores and open houses, particularly while under stress.

It does eventually escalate to the point where she tries to steal her sister's baby, although considering the situation that led to it, it's hard to blame her.
-   _The Brittas Empire_: It is revealed in the episode "Sex, Lies, and Red Tape" that every time Helen falls pregnant, she gains the urge to shoplift unnecessary stuff (one of the things shoplifted was a wedding dress that was too small for her). She had been convicted at least seven times before the events of that episode, leading to her freaking out when she was caught.
-   Gina from _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_ apparently has a habit of swiping objects and Terry has to specifically task Rosa to keep an eye on Gina when they visit Holt's house. Unfortunately, she'd already stuffed her bag full of loot.

Sure enough, she has it, and everyone instantly realizes that she's responsible for everything else. She takes off, and in his futile efforts to find her, Luka learns that she was also stealing from the bar where she previously worked.
-   _Frasier_: One woman calls into Frasier's show and reveals she's recently started stealing things because it gives her a thrill to take them.

Her story inspires Frasier, who's recently realised how dull his own life is, to steal a keepsake from his neighbor when she asks him over to help change a lightbulb.
-   _Friends_: One of Rachel's Guys of the Week frequently steals cash from her purse and walks off with one of her jackets when she's not looking.

-   _Game of Thrones_: Even after Daenerys commands Kovarro not to steal anything from their host Xaro Xhoan Daxos, he takes a golden wine chalice, dumps the wine, and takes the chalice.
-   On _Gilmore Girls,_ Jess, in his early episodes, would steal things for his own amusement, to alleviate Small Town Boredom after going From New York to Nowhere.

-   Played for Drama (and somewhat more realistically) in an episode of _Law & Order: Criminal Intent_ when a couple of murderers are caught when one of them can't resist stealing an eggcup from their victims' home. This leads to a somewhat Narmy ending where her partner screams "EGGCUP!" at her while he's hauled off.
-   Parker from _Leverage_ is an prolific pickpocket. She poses as a kleptomaniac when the team needs to infiltrate a rehab facility, and in the same episode, she pickpockets someone _accidentally_ because it's so reflexive for her.

-   A more realistic than usual example on _My Name Is Earl_ of all things, with a recurring character who is shamefully compelled to steal pens and _only_ pens, regardless of how many he has already, and regardless of the fact that he doesn't even _want_ the pens. Still Played for Laughs, though.

The woman leaves in a huff, but not before taking a folding chair along with her.
-   In an episode of _Waiting for God_, several residents report items missing from their rooms. It turns out to be resident ditz Betty who's absent-mindedly stealing everything.
-   Neal Caffrey from _White Collar_ has this problem, especially early in the series. As a convicted felon and confidential informant for the FBI, it probably isn't a good idea to pick his handler's pocket, yet he still does it. Even though, considering the characters, and the fact that Neal tends to give what he steals from Peter back almost immediately, this probably amounts to good-natured teasing in the context of their relationship, doing this to a federal agent doesn't say much for Neal's self-preservation. Lampshaded by Mozzie, another thief who likes stealing things just as much, but does not have the impulse control of a two-year-old.
    
    **Mozzie** (after Neal steals a painting despite the fact that it would be incredibly obvious that he stole it, and he could go back to prison for a long time if someone found out): You're like a child.

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   _Dragonlance_: The Kender are an entire race of pseudo-Hobbits who are relentless thieves that will pick pockets and break into locked chests/drawers/houses without even consciously thinking about it, to the point that the "kender greeting" from other races is to swear and protectively clutch at one's valuables. Worse, they do this out of intense natural curiosity, meaning every single kender is convinced that they're only borrowing interesting things in good faith, and will certainly return them. Except they often wander off and forget the whole thing... but they're utterly convinced that they're not doing anything wrong. In fact, accuse a kender of being a thief and he will protest at length. Kender always have dozens of pockets in which they keep their various pilfered goods. As a gameplay mechanic, a Kender can check their pockets to try and find an item of trivial value that they have stolen without remembering. This trait is one of many reasons why kender are considered The Scrappy of the setting and even of _D&D_ as a whole.
    -   _Half_\-kender keep the kender tendency to unthinkingly "borrow" interesting things, but tend to feel worse about it as their human side lets them have a better understanding of concepts like ownership and private property. On the plus side, they tend to be better at remembering to _actually_ return the things they pick up; on the negative side people tend to react negatively to them since they still tend to pick up things and don't look like kender so you don't realize you have to take measures to protect your stuff.
-   _GURPS_: The semi-felinoid alien Sparrials in the Space setting have Kleptomania as a trait in their species template.
-   _Warhammer_:
    -   The Skaven of Clan Carrion are shameless thieves, and will gladly help themselves to anything they think they can get away with filching — even within the clan, a Skaven of Clan Carrion only truly owns what he's currently clutching in his own claws.
    -   _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_: The Halflings are stereotyped as having sticky fingers, but the reasoning behind it is quite complex. Halflings usually live in large villages where everyone is more or less related. This leads to property rights being rather fluid; if something is missing, it's probably been borrowed by someone who needed it and who might or might not bring it back, but who really cares since we can borrow someone else's. This attitude, when transferred to human or Dwarf society (both of whom are _very_ keen on personal property) easily comes across as skuzzy.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   The Blood Ravens obsessively collect artifacts of historical value, especially anything that might hold a clue to their lost history. Fanonically, this is exaggerated (perhaps not terribly so), to the point of grabbing anything that might be of historical value, a useful weapon or piece of wargear, or bling for the heck of it.
    -   Orks of the Deathskulls clan have a marked tendency to filch anything that catches their eye, regardless of whether it's clearly unattended, just laying around, in another Ork's pile of stuff, or in another Ork's pockets.

    Toys 

-   Ox and Wedgehead from _UglyDolls_ are compulsive thieves with the tendency to "borrow" from others without the intent of returning. They claim it's their magic trick of turning your stuff into their stuff.

    Video Games 

-   _100% Orange Juice_: Marie Poppo kickstarts the plots of the various campaigns by stealing other characters’ valuables. This is also demonstrated by her Hyper “Ubiquitous” where it has her teleport to another character and steal their stars. Turns out she (or rather, _they_) do this to lead everyone to Tomomo.
-   _Assassin's Creed III_: A side-mission assigned to Connor by Daniel Boone entails the investigation of none other than the Sasquatch. Keeping with the generalized "nothing is actually supernatural" trait of the larger franchise, it turns out that the creature is actually a very big, very hairy man living in the wilderness who, when found by Connor, admits to being a kleptomaniac but is ultimately harmless. After learning the truth, Connor just leaves him alone.
-   Adventurers with the Kleptomania negative quirk in _Darkest Dungeon_ randomly half-inch stuff out of curios in the dungeons. Unusually, it's considered to be one of the _very worst_ quirks a hero can have, for two reasons. One, the Hamlet runs entirely on the loot economy, and anything stolen by a Kleptomaniac adventurer isn't coming back. Two, a lot of items you can interact with need a special item to make safe - keys, purifying herbs, holy water - and Kleptomaniac adventurers don't bother, meaning they tend to cost a bit more in bandages, antivenom, and medical treatments from all the blight, bleed and diseases they pick up from opening trapped chests and rooting through the guts of decaying sea creatures.
-   Billiken is a more aggressive version of this in _Devil Survivor 2_ - he compulsively mugs other demons (or tamers) and has no qualms about killing. Once he depletes your wallet, he can hit you with the powerful _Barrage Strike_ move.
-   The thief units in _Disgaea_ are given this characterisation.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series, this is a cultural trait of the Khajiit. As their language has no word for "rules" and they take a rather _loose_ view of what constitutes personal property, this is unusually Justified. In their culture, taking things that belong to others simply isn't seen as wrong. Unsurprisingly, this leads to significant Culture Clash with the other races who consider the Khajiit taking things to be "theft", and the Fantastic Racists of those races use it against the Khajiit to bar them from their cities and even to justify slavery. Additionally, Khajiit who've lived among other cultures have shown the ability to grasp the concept.
-   _Moshi Monsters_: Zigzagged. Tiki the toucan tends to steal objects with the intention of just borrowing them but neglecting to return them. Baz Barnacle takes things from his cousin Buck and sells them, but as far as he's concerned, he's just borrowing them. Raffles the Sneaky Tealeaf steals objects a lot but he always gives them back.
-   _Overlord_: Jewel the Thief is one of the Fallen Heroes who defeated the last Overlord. Representing Envy, she obsessively steals items simply for the sake of stealing them, losing all interest in the item once it's hers. She was corrupted by the Wizard, possessed by the slain Overlord, into following her base desire.
-   Shir Gold from _Phantasy Star II_ has a random chance of stealing from every armory, armor shop, or item shop you enter with her in the party. The downside of this is that she'll also hightail back to your base, even if you're currently on an entirely different planet.

-   The twin ghosts at the Labyrinth of Amala in _Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne_ will take the nonviolent approach: they will offer you tea for a very low sum. The tea is drugged, and they will kick you and our demons back into the entrance of that Kalpa, after helping themselves to more of your money, of course.
-   _The Sims 3_: You can give your Sims the "Kleptomaniac" trait. It lets you swipe three items per day. However, the item your Sim steals is random.
-   Spies in _The Sims Medieval_ can steal from other Sims as well as from the messenger posts. Because of this, spies can get more money more easily than almost any other profession.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_ has Rouge the Bat, a "professional treasure hunter". Often she makes no attempt to hide how she wants to steal the Master Emerald from Knuckles, either.
-   The Villager in the _Super Smash Bros._ series is portrayed this way, whose Pocket move allows the Villager to grab objects not already held by someone else, store it, and use it later. This includes nearly all projectiles in the game, most of the items that occasionally drop onto the stage, and anything left on the ground by any character's moves (including things that shouldn't logically be able to fit in the Villager's trousers' pocket, such as energy blasts, lightning bolts, and Rush).
-   Garrett of _Thief_ usually gives "the rent is due" as an excuse for his thieving, or has some other objective he needs to accomplish. However, it is clear from his actions and dialogue that he really enjoys theft. For example, when a museum in _Deadly Shadows_ boasts that its security is impenetrable, Garrett takes it as a personal challenge.
-   Marisa Kirisame in _Touhou_ figures that since a human lifespan is so much shorter than the lifespans of the Youkai that make up so much of the cast, she can just "borrow" whatever she wants from them, and they can have it back after she's dead. Unsurprisingly, it doesn't convince anyone, and sometimes the victim will take what's theirs back. It also just so happens that Marisa's an Immortality Seeker...
-   Nekomiya Mana of _Zenless Zone Zero_ is semi-reformed criminal gangster who's still a firm believer that everyone's wallets are also her wallets. Regardless of whether or not she's obtained consent or you realize she has it now.

    Webcomics 

-   Thief in _8-Bit Theater_, who steals from everyone (both via outright sleight of hand and contracts with legal mumbo jumbo) to finance the search for a cure for his sick father. When this is done he still steals everything that's isn't both nailed down and on fire.
-   Uru of _Archipelago_ compulsively steals from his teammates even when transformed into a jabberwocky , and Credenza always makes him return the items or pretends she just found them and returns them herself.
-   The pixie Feiht in _Chasing the Sunset_ regards anything shiny as there for the taking. (Spelling her name backwards gives you a clue to her personality.)
-   Sam Starfall in _Freefall_ is good enough at pickpocketing that his sticky fingers become a problem when he tries to go honest. At one point, the Mayor's assistant tests whether he's dead or just unconscious by waving a wallet under his nose, and concludes he's only stunned when he instinctively bites down on it.
    
    **Sam:** "Honest Sam" is what they'll call me.  
    **Helix:** You've got somebody's wallet again.  
    **Sam:** This could be a problem. I have no idea how that got there.
    
-   "The Raccoon" from _Kiwi Blitz_. He steals "random crap" purely for thrills, and doesn't mind returning it when forced to do so. A later flashback shows that he literally has kleptomania.
-   The dungeon rats in _Latchkey Kingdom_ like to collect "treasures", which can be actual artifacts or random junk they found and liked.
-   _Megatokyo_: Meimi Sonoda and her daughter Yuki. They often only realize they have stolen something when on their way home. Their kleptomania is tied to their powers. Meimi is an expy of Saint Tail.
-   Spring Clean of _Star Mares_ is a hoarder of 'collectibles,' with a particular fascination for shiny things - including ancient mystical artifacts that are part of the inner workings of immortal cyborg generals.
-   Sette Frummagem from _Unsounded_. Her dad is a head of the thieves' guild, so it's no surprise that she would become a pickpocket. What _is_ a surprise is how _good_ she is at it.
-   Sidney Malik Of _Widdershins_ is cursed with this. Walking through a crowd could result in an extra ten wallets with no effort from him. He isn't happy with the curse and it may have played a part in him being expelled.

    Web Original 

-   Drivena steals everything from a seemingly worthless amulet to a pen from the police station in _Aegeroth: A Checkered History_.
-   Hazard from the _Whateley Universe_ is a known kleptomaniac.
    -   As is Packrat, who has been caught stealing anything that looks interesting, regardless of how dangerous it might be.
    -   Belphegor, in keeping with his codename<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , is both a capable (if arrogant) inventor and a lazy slob; he's also a notorious thief of other inventors' equipment and ideas. While he isn't as compulsive about it as Hazard, he is widely despised for this and several other unpleasant aspects of his personality. His mental duplicate, Belphoebe, has proven to be a lot less irritating over all, though she's still quick to rip off others when the opportunity arises. Mind you, theft is common among the Mad Scientist students in general; Belphegor is merely the most blatant about it.

    Web Videos 

-   Nott in _Critical Role_ feels especially compelled to do this when she spots fancy jewelry or attractive baubles. And in the following campaign, Fearne makes a habit of this as well, simply because she doesn't see anything wrong with taking something if she wants it.
-   _SMPLive_: At first, Wilbur steals because Schlatt & Co. convince him to, but later he does it just because he can.
-   Joseph from _SuperMarioLogan_ is implied to be one, since "Joseph's House!" reveals he efficiently stole Bowser Junior's Clown Car and house painting as well as Cody's Go-Kart trophy. At the end of the video, however, Junior and Cody take the Clown Car and trophy with them when they flee from Joseph's run-down house after extremely getting scared by a Boo.

    Western Animation 

-   _Centaurworld_: Glendale the gerenuk centaur is a compulsive kleptomaniac, and often needs to physically restrain herself from stealing objects to hoard in the portal on her belly. She later says that taking what doesn't belong to her makes her "feel alive".
-   Swiper the Fox from _Dora the Explorer_ is one of the most iconic examples of this trope. Once an episode showing up at random times to steal whatever is relevant to the plot from Dora and Boots. Though everyone saying "Swiper no swiping" three times before he takes anything always makes him back down.
-   _DuckTales (1987)_: While a common thief otherwise, Dijon seems to suffer from kleptomania, being unable to resist stealing even when not intending to, including stealing worthless junk like old shoes.
-   _Futurama_: Bender. Just as well he seems to have near-infinite space in his chest, though in one episode he goes on such an epic spree of kleptomania that he nearly fills it up.
    
    **Fry:** Come on, Bender. I'm sure there's plenty of cool stuff to swipe.  
    **Bender:** I don't know, Fry. I feel like, for the first time in my life, I've stolen enough.  
    **Fry:** What?!? Snap out of it! _\[slaps Bender\]_  
    **Bender:** Wow, thanks, buddy. Don't know what came over me. _\[sing-song\] Oh, I love stealin'. I love takin' things._
    
-   In an episode of _Goof Troop_, Pete accidentally turns Goofy into one using hypnosis.
-   Grunkle Stan from _Gravity Falls_ will steal anything he wants or needs, from waxworks to light bulbs. While he does have his reasons, such as having spent his late teens to his late twenties living alone in poverty, it's mostly due to his greed and the fact that he seems to genuinely enjoy breaking the law.

-   _The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh_ has a recuring trio of packrats who steal anything that catches their eye. They insist they are not stealing because they "pay" for whatever they take by replacing it with walnuts.

-   In the 2018 reboot of _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_, Entrapta has no moral qualms about petty theft. On two separate occasions, she steals someone's tiny food. When she needs a six-sided hex driver, she enters Hordak's sanctum without permission and takes one.
-   Homer Simpson from _The Simpsons_ has been known to steal beer mugs from Moe's, office supplies (including computers) from work, and especially just about anything from Ned Flanders. One episode had him get a job at a Walmart parody only to find out every employee has a shock collar on their neck. When his coworkers told him they all knew how to disable the collars and steal everything that's not nailed down, they asked him not to judge them. Homer not only doesn't judge them but he steals an entire cart of TVs right then and there.

-   Mr. Krabs in _SpongeBob SquarePants_. One episode had an amusement park hosting a "Free Day" where everything in the park was free. Mr. Krabs took this to mean _everything_, including streetlight lightbulbs and _the egg of the star attraction._
-   Red X in _Teen Titans_ outright states that he steals for fun.
-   The mysterious pickpocket in the _Tintin_ episode "The Secret of the Unicorn" is revealed to be a kleptomaniac old man who doesn't see anything wrong with collecting wallets (he doesn't even empty them out, just puts them on a shelf in alphabetical order).

    Real Life 

-   A common misconception is that magpies steal shiny objects to line their nests, though studies seem to show that, while Magpies do indeed enjoy stealing objects, they have no attraction to shiny things over other objects, and are actually often nervous of them since they are unfamiliar and may pose a threat.
-   This ferret. Ferrets and mustelidae in general are well known for this.
-   Monkeys are known to steal food, backpacks, phones, or anything they can take from people.
-   One of the unfortunate tendencies of King Farouk of Egypt was his habit of stealing from his hosts. He famously stole a pocket watch from the British Prime Minister (nobody's quite clear whether it was Winston Churchill, Neville Chamberlain, or Clement Attlee), and filched a sword from his brother-in-law, the Shah of Iran. He thus obtained the unenviable nickname, "The Thief of Cairo." He was overthrown in 1952.
