_"Frail? You? Serra, you have no need of any escort to protect you. Even the most hardened criminal would flee in terror after five minutes in your company."_

The single most powerful deterrent to kidnapping in all fiction (and certainly in the mundane category) is to be so annoying that the kidnapper requires an active force of will to keep their sanity. What makes them annoying isn't important. In truly bizarre cases, the kidnappers can be annoyed because their victim insists on being kind, upbeat, and forgiving even through torture. The point is, nobody wants to be around them and that ransom note looks increasingly unimportant as compared to the promise of not having to deal with the Anthropomorphic Personification of "damned pest" day in and day out.

This can lead to an especially awkward situation when it turns out that the extortee doesn't want the hostage back. Expect much comedy to abound in this scenario, in part because a sufficiently vicious kidnapper would not get in this situation in the first place. Foiled by niceness once again, it seems.

This trope is a fairly old one. O. Henry's famous example "The Ransom of Red Chief" executes this trope using a pair of kidnappers (and a particularly bratty kid as the "victim") back in 1910, and there are stories, jokes, and folk tales going back to the Middle Ages and beyond of someone who escapes damnation because the Devil Himself doesn't want to deal with her (and it was almost _always_ a her, because the Middle Ages were like that).

It's fairly common for this trope to be invoked if the captive is particularly Genre Savvy or cunning. Subversions, aversions, and defiances of this Trope usually (although not universally) involve the kidnapper hitting a Rage Breaking Point and demonstrating how much of a bad idea this was, being unrelentingly evil in the face of said annoyance, or the hostage finding out the hard way that whatever is the final objective of the kidnapper they don't need to be alive (or at least conscious) for it to be achieved.

Compare Too Spicy for Yog-Sothoth, where the captive is intolerable even to the most hardened captor, Prefer Jail to the Protagonist, where the villain is forced to flee from the hero's presence even if it means being re-incarcerated, and Talking the Monster to Death, where the captive directly challenges the captor's beliefs and motivations. Contrast Poisonous Captive, who insidiously subverts and undermines the captors. If you pity the kidnappers because they're about to get their asses kicked by the kidnappee, then that's Mugging the Monster. Also compare Defiant Captive, who is more 'uncooperative' than simply 'annoying'. See also Sick Captive Scam, which is another trope that works better when the captors don't want any harm to come to the captive.

Not to be confused with Stockholm Syndrome, in which the kidnappee develops pity/amicability with the kidnapper; Contrast Lima Syndrome, in which the kidnapper actually starts to _like_ or feel sympathy for the victim.

    Anime & Manga 

-   An early episode of _Dragon Ball GT_ saw Goku, transformed into a child by the Black Star Dragon Balls, get kidnapped by a gang of thugs. (Well, technically he goes along with them willingly, not realizing that they are kidnappers.) He forces them to spend all of their money on food for him, undermines their attempts to negotiate a ransom from his friends, and in the end simply flies away when it's time to go home.
-   In _Hetalia: Axis Powers_, Germany, America, England, and France have ALL, on separate occasions, tried to hold Italy prisoner. It never works out.
    -   Germany has recently taken Italy prisoner. Germany, bored out of his mind and furious that Italy doesn't even want to escape, is pushed to the limit when Italy starts singing Germany a song. The song starts out as complimentary, but it then starts to insult Germany's attitude, food, "scary tourists" and overly abrasive girls. Italy is shipped back home in a box before he is even finished singing.
    -   The Allies shipped Italy back to Germany _twice_, once after America captured him (although they were willing to keep him like a dog until he insulted England's cooking, at which point America immediately decided not to keep him), then again after France captured him. Both times, the box had 'FUCK' written on it, in big, bold letters.
-   In _Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle_, you will feel sorry for the demons who kidnapped Princess Syalis of the Human Nation as they constantly feel the wrath of the Princess in her quest for the perfect sleep.
-   In _Zoids: New Century_, Polta and the Backdraft Group have kidnapped Leena. While he calmly attempts to negotiate, Leena can be heard in the background shouting down her kidnappers and harassing them. Polta stops talking twice, once to order them to restrain her and another after asking "excuse me a minute", when she threw something that hit him in the face. He leaves the video call to stop her and returns visibly beaten and disheveled, but successful at least.

    Audio Plays 

-   _Big Finish Doctor Who_: This is the Fifth Doctor's reaction when he discovers that Peri has been abducted by kidnappers who have mistaken her for Queen Anne in _The Church and the Crown_.

    Comic Books 

-   Happens a few times in the _Asterix_ stories.
    -   In _Asterix the Gladiator_, Cacofonix is captured by a Roman prefect to give to Caesar as a gift. The suffering of the kidnappers only increases on their journey as they spend more and more time with Cacofonix's singing which however ends up giving them a much more effective threat than the whip for the galley slaves who promise to do their best if this inhuman torture stops, which it does in the old-fashioned way. And as for Caesar, he doesn't deserve pity either, as he is not the one guarding Cacophonix's cell but rather some poor soul of a legionary.
    -   In _Asterix in Spain_, Romans try to get a village of Iberians to surrender by holding the chief's son Pepe hostage. Pepe is, of course, a Bratty Half-Pint who drives the Roman soldiers guarding him up the wall, complicated by the fact that Julius ordered for no abuse or punishment against the child (in order to better indoctrinate him) and is little better when Asterix and Obelix offer to take him home to his father.
-   There has been at least one _Batman_ story wherein Alfred is kidnapped by thugs with ambitions towards the Wayne trust fund. Unfortunately for them, Alfred is generally portrayed as a Retired Badass with shades of Battle Butler.
-   In The DCU, Lobo, Karnevil, and The Joker have all been kicked out of hell at one point or another. Lobo for throwing wild parties and causing massive damage to demons and property, Karnevil for annoying/freaking out the demons by constantly pointing out better torture methods, and the Joker for being the Joker.
-   _Impulse_ #50: "Impulse Agent of the Bat". Bart is drawn into a Batman/Joker conflict and the combination of his Super-Speed and short attention span prove to be too annoying for The Joker.
-   Features in a _Judge Dredd_ story, where a criminal kidnaps a woman for ransom after she frees him in the mistaken belief that Society Is to Blame. Of course, she's so saccharinely annoying that he's soon begging to be taken to prison just to get away from her.
-   Lucky Luke's fiancee in the album of the same name is kidnapped by the Dalton gang as bait to get Luke. Like most examples of this trope she gets on Joe's nerves and leads the rest of the boys to housework and chores. Instead of doing the obvious thing of tying her up and gagging her, they surrender.
-   The Marvel Universe robot character Machine Man (Aaron Stack) was nudged toward sentience by the alien Celestials at his creation. Years later, they abducted him and took him into space. They then returned him to Earth with little explanation for their actions. Suffering from self-esteem issues, Aaron claims they returned him because they thought he was boring and obnoxious.
    -   A flashback in _Nextwave_ (which may or may not be real) has the Celestials telling Aaron that he's a loser. Complete with L on the forehead. And they mock him further when he Wangsts about it.
        
        **Celestial:** Aaron Stack, you who were called Machine Man. You have travelled with us for three hundred and sixty cycles by your reckoning of time. There is now something we have to tell you. You are total ☠☠☠☠.  
        **Aaron:** ... What?  
        **Celestial:** No. Really. You're ☠☠☠☠. We've taken a year of you. We're taking you back to that orbiting trashcan you call a planet. And dumping you there. ... You're turning away from us. We are speaking to you and you're turning away from us. This is exactly the kind of ☠☠☠☠ we're talking about here.
        
-   _Mortadelo y Filemón_: in the story where Mortadelo's and Filemón's nephews appear, they are kidnapped by a soon-to-be judged criminal that demands all proofs against him as payment. The two children proceed to make his life a living hell for his troubles. Of course, it ends up working for him when the kids destroy those proofs as part of his games.
-   In the first arc of the _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (IDW)_ comics, Chrysalis gives the Mane Six three days to find and rescue the Cutie Mark Crusaders, partly because that's when the Comet of Doom will be in position, but mostly because she's _already_ starting to get annoyed by their constant chatter and cutie mark obsession.
-   _Tintin_:
    -   Abdullah, the son of Emir Kalish Ezab, is a Spoiled Brat and an absolute terror who constantly pulls painful pranks on his captors in "Land of Black Gold", even when he's actively held at gunpoint by Dr. Mueller. This also leads to the villain's capture, as Mueller tries to shoot himself with the gun Abdullah gave him to avoid capture, but it turns out to be a squirt gun full of ink.
    -   While she isn't thrown out, Bianca Castafiore's stay in a San Theodoran prison in "Tintin and the Picaros" is very stressful on the guards, who keep coming out of her cell with spaghetti on their heads because it wasn't cooked to her liking. When she is rescued by Tintin and the revolutionaries, she wants to break into song, which is met by a hasty "No! No!" by Captain Haddock and the San Theodoran officer.

    Comic Strips 

-   An old _Bloom County_ strip features Bill the Cat being traded to the Soviets in a prisoner exchange, causing one character to remark "Such a fate even the evil empire don't deserve!"
-   _Doonesbury_: The Red Rascal's been captured by terrorists, but he had just googled a certain Ear Worm.
    
    **Red Rascal:** ...Friday. Gettin' down on Friday! Everybody's lookin' forward to the weekend!  
    **Terrorist 1:** Aggg...  
    **Terrorist 2:** No! No more!
    
-   One _Piranha Club_ story arc had Mother Packer being kidnapped. Much asskicking ensued.

    Fan Works 

-   A good portion of _Calvin and Hobbes III: Double Trouble_ is Calvin and Hobbes annoying Chill (his kidnapper). Rupert and Earl exploit this in order to kill Calvin.
-   In _Conversations with a Cryptid_, this happens to the poor sods who decide to kidnap Izuku. All for One is _not happy_ about how they tortured his only child, and both rescues Izuku and turns the lot of them into chunky salsa.
-   In _Earth and Sky_, at one point Diamond Tiara is abducted by the Changelings... and is shortly after kicked out of their hive, because even they can't stand her.
-   Defied (in a most soberingly brutal fashion) on _I Against I, Me Against You_: Rarity's attempt to pull this trick on the Big Bad (explicitly referencing the episode "A Dog And Pony Show") ends with said Big Bad (a violent psychopath Knight of Cerebus, unlike the Goldfish Poop Gang that were the Diamond Dogs) murdering a fellow prisoner Mauve Shirt right in front of Rarity in retaliation.
-   _Infinity Crisis_: In _Gamma Relations_, when Tony states how Bruce has been kidnapped Pietro asks who they should be sending condolence cards to.
-   _The Lord of the Rings_ fanfic _the Ransom At The Redhorn_ explores the situation where Elrond's wife Celebrían (daughter of Galadriel) is taken prisoner by Orcs. The canon tells us unspecified torments were suffered in the Orc-Den. But, as Thranduil Oropherion Redux points out, the reality of who _suffered_ torments and who _inflicted_ the torments might be rather different. It is noticeable Elrond was not in much of a hurry to get his wife back.
-   Deconstructed in _The Rise of Darth Vulcan_. When Diamond Tiara gets kidnapped by Darth Vulcan, she whines and screams and cries and kvetches and does everything this trope involves—so the evil overlord just proceeds to treat her as brutally as possible until she lets it off. He later comments that this trope doesn't actually work in real life.
-   _To The Limit_ has Orihime using her powers of Rejection to give Aizen his "Terrible, Horrible, No-Good, Very Bad Week." It proves extremely effective in driving him up the wall and releasing her from captivity

    -   What happens when Meme is imprisoned in the AU arc.
    -   Also what happens to the poor, poor, MAFIAA\-serving mons tasked with taking Dintel to more or less the in-universe version of Hell. It ends up with them _kicking him out of there_.
-   In _Miraculous Showdown_, Jack Spicer kidnaps Chloe Bourgeois to intimidate her father, the mayor, into handing over the control of Paris to him. Chat Noir warns Jack that kidnapping Chloe won't end well, and sure enough, Chloe's Spoiled Brat attitude drives him up against the well. By the end of chapter 6, he is begging Ladybug and Chat to take Chloe away from him.
-   In this _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind_ fancomic, La Squadra kidnaps Giorno and tries to hold him for ransom. It doesn't go as planned.
    
    **Risotto**: And if you don't comply to our demands—  
    **Bucciarati**: _(holding a check with "daycare" written on it)_ Do you take check?  
    **Risotto**: What.  
    **Bucciarati**: And can you let him know we'll pick him up after Narancia's eye appointment? _(meanwhile, Giorno is creating a snake to bite Prosciutto and a swarm of flies to chase Pesci)_
    

    Films — Animation 

-   In _How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World_, an attempt by the heroes to capture Grimmel the Grisly goes bad and, in their haste to retreat, Ruffnut is left behind. When Grimmel locks her up, she starts babbling literally non-stop about all sorts of trivial nonsense (including her annoying twin brother, her love life, and her hair braids) until he snaps, releases her, gives her a dragon fledgling to ride, and tells her to just get out. Ruffnut is quite proud of how she used her talent to be annoying this way. Unfortunately, she's not nearly as clever as she thinks; Grimmel also heard her babbling about the Hooligan tribe's new island base and had her followed back to them.
-   Deconstructed in _Rango_; when Beans is kidnapped by the bad guys and gets defiant/irritating, Rattlesnake Jake just starts beating and choking her to force her to comply. When she continues resisting, he almost kills her and only stops when Rango interrupts him.
-   In _Strange Magic_, The Bog King kidnaps the fairy princess Dawn in order to get back a love potion. Unfortunately, she's been hit with it, and falls in love with him and can't stop singing about it, driving everyone in the castle up the walls. He solves this by using her desire to please him by convincing her to go to sleep.
-   In _The Swan Princess: Escape from Castle Mountain_: Clavius, an Evil Sorcerer, kidnaps Queen Uberta, who manages to redecorate the dungeon, get good food and get the Clavius' minion Knuckles confused enough to follow _her_ orders instead of his. She also keeps complaining about how it's her birthday. She doesn't even stop when Clavius turns her into a bunch of different animals.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Baby's Day Out_ has three bumbling kidnappers completely unable to keep one baby corraled, with hilariously painful results. The baby isn't _trying_ to hurt anyone, he's just going about his adventure. It's the kidnappers themselves who are getting into trouble.
-   In _Dennis the Menace_, Switchblade Sam is initially okay with taking Dennis hostage, but Dennis being his usual mischievous self, he doesn't make things easy for Sam.
-   _Fresh Meat_: After springing Ritchie, the gang decides to hideout at the Crane family's house. Unfortunately, once it's revealed that Cranes' are a Cannibal Clan, it isn't long before Ritchie's gang are the ones that are in trouble.
-   French movie _Le Grand Chef_ is an adaptation of _The Ransom of Red Chief_. You do the math.
-   The main character in _High Strung_ spends most of the film complaining about whatever is within his view. At the end, he is dragged away by Death (played by Jim Carrey), who eventually lets him go because he complains so much.
-   In _Midnight Run_, Jack is a licensed bounty hunter, not a kidnapper, but otherwise the dynamic is the same, as Mardukas annoys the bejesus out of him with his constant irritating questions. The same film showcases a defiance of this trope when rival bounty hunter Marvin gets a hold of Mardukas: Mardukas starts trying to be annoying, but Marvin just knocks him out with one punch and by the time Mardukas wakes up again, they've made it all the way to Las Vegas and Marvin has handcuffed him to a toilet and is taking pictures of him as proof he's got him so he can sell him out to The Mafia.
-   _The Mummy Returns_, too, couldn't resist dragging this one out. ("Are we there yet?" "No." "Are we there yet?" "No." "Are we there yet?" "NO!")
-   _No Deposit, No Return_ — again, the kidnapees are child terrors.
-   In _Pure Luck_ (and the original French movie _La Chèvre_), an extremely accident-prone woman goes on a vacation and ends up getting Easy Amnesia. A guy sees an opportunity (correctly assuming her family to be wealthy) and takes her, figuring he could get a lot of money for her return, once she remembers who she is, that is. By the time the detectives find the guy, he has lost all his money to her bad luck and is in debt to a drug dealer. He explains that he ended up passing her off to another guy. Naturally, things aren't much better for that guy either (she costs him a plane, for one).
-   The entire plot of _The Ref_. A jewel thief takes a couple hostage while he tries to get out of town, only for him to find out the hard way how dysfunctional they are. And _then_ the rest of the Dysfunction Junction shows up for Christmas dinner, which means he has to pretend to be the couple's marriage counselor in order to keep from arousing suspicion. Hilarity Ensues.
-   _Ruthless People_ is all about this trope (and You Can Keep Her! too).
-   _A Straightforward Boy_ is a 1929 short film about two kidnappers who grab a Japanese boy, only to send him back after the boy proves way too irritating.
-   _Tales of Halloween_: In "The Ransom of Rusty Rex", two kidnappers abduct what they believe to be the son of a millionaire. However, their victim actually turns out to be a malicious goblin that has been plaguing the millionaire's life for years. Now that it is gone, he has no intention of ever taking it back.
-   In "Weird Al" Yankovic's movie _UHF_ janitor/uber-popular children's show host Stanley Spadowski drives his Mafia captors crazy with his inane guessing games and loud rendition of the theme from _Bonanza_. It's not entirely clear if he even knew he'd been kidnapped; he was blindfolded and being driven away at gunpoint before he realized that they weren't pizza delivery guys.
    -   To give an example as to how inane the guessing games were, Stanley was trying to get them to play I-Spy... while he was blindfolded.
        
        _Stanley_: I'm thinking of something orange. Something orange. Give up? It's an orange!
        

    Literature 

-   Jasmine's attempt to kidnap Matt from a casino hotel in _The Affix_ goes _way_ south from the outset. Having lost a few marbles already, Matt is starting to understand the probability-breaking gem he's stuck with, and uses it along with his newfound brashness to tweak her repeatedly until her eye twitches—then tries to make her other eye twitch. Then the kidnapping is interrupted by a third party and her night gets a whole lot worse.
-   In _Animorphs_ one Yeerk is practically driven _insane_ by his own host. Said host constantly recited _Henry V_, so when the yeerk finds the Time Matrix the first thing he does with it is kill the inspiration for that play, just to silence him.
-   The now-out-of-print children's picture book _The Barons Booty_ is about a nefarious but soft-hearted Wicked Baron who kidnaps a nobleman's dozen-or-so young daughters while gloating in rhyme about the ransom he plans to demand for them. The children turn out to be cute but demanding, and the kind-hearted baron is worn down trying to keep them happy. To his shock, the girls' father declares that he is rather enjoying his break from them and sees no reason to take them all back. The baron ends up bankrupting himself bribing the father to let him return the kids.
-   Saki's "The Disappearance of Crispina Umberleigh" inverts this trope by having the kidnap victim be odious enough that the kidnappers successfully extract eight years' worth of ransom from her family by threatening to _return her._ Even though, as it turns out, they don't actually have her.
-   Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_:
    -   The Nac Mac Feegle, a race of belligerent, six-inch tall, red-haired, kilt-wearing blue men (also known as pictsies) were rumoured to have been thrown out of Fairyland for being drunk and disorderly. This trope is even more perfectly exemplified in _Wintersmith_, the third book featuring them, where they accompany the young man Roland to the Underworld to rescue the goddess Summer. Roland gets across the river Styx by paying The Ferryman, who readers may find familiar, the classical two pennies, but when he retrieves Summer and wants to cross back the other way, the Ferrier demands another sixpence, which Roland doesn't have. However, when the Feegles say that if Roland stays, they're obligated to stay with him, the ferryman quickly changes his mind and lets them go.
    -   In _Carpe Jugulum_, where Granny Weatherwax is about to march off into the woods after the Magpyrs. Mightily Oates (a visiting Omnian priest quite unaware of Granny's reputation) asks the villagers:
        
        **Oates:** Aren't you going to stop her? There are _monsters_ in that forest!  
        **Villagers:** So why should we care what happens to a bunch of monsters? That's Granny Weatherwax, that is.
        
    -   In _Feet of Clay_, a gang takes Angua (a werewolf) hostage. Their injuries are reported as "self-inflicted".
-   In the _Enchanted Forest Chronicles_, Herman the dwarf is really tired of helping girls spin straw into gold and then claiming their firstborn children along with a share of the cash. It's not that he doesn't like the children, it's just that they're expensive to feed, forcing him to run the same dodge all over again to get more money.
    -   His dialogue implies he's long since stopped _trying_ to kidnap children; first he legally changed his name to Herman to make his name easy to guess (it never worked), then he tried moving out away from everybody. People still find him and keep managing to talk him into spinning more straw into gold, and he always gets stuck with more children. The children themselves are generally well-behaved, and he does like children and takes good care of them - it's the _situation_ which is unfortunate.
-   _Forest Kingdom_: In book 1 (_Blue Moon Rising_), Prince Rupert arrives at a dragon's lair only to find a dragon who desperately wants to be rid of an aggressive, tomboyish, _loud_ princess who was sent to it to die. When asked later why the dragon is helping them, Rupert answers that he rescued it from a princess.
-   The short story "A Good Boy" by Desmond Warzel references "The Ransom of Red Chief" by name. The titular boy turns out to be a lot more than just an annoyance, though...
-   In P. G. Wodehouse's short story "Helping Freddie" (later rewritten for the _Jeeves and Wooster_ series as "Fixing It for Freddie"), a young Upper-Class Twit comes up with a Zany Scheme to help his friend Freddie, whose fianceé has broken up with him. He kidnaps a small boy who he thinks is the fianceé's cousin, intending for Freddie to bring the kid home and play the hero. Then the boy turns out to be unrelated to the fianceé, his actual guardian turns out to be in quarantine, and our hero is stuck with him for the rest of the story.
    
    _By Jove, you know, till I started to tramp the place with this infernal kid, I never had a notion it would have been so deuced difficult to restore a child to its anxious parents. It's a mystery to me how kidnappers ever get caught._
    
-   _Hondo Ohnaka's Not-So-Big-Score_: Hondo and his gang spend a lot of credits and go through a lot of humiliation as part of their scheme to kidnap several wealthy cruise ship passengers. They only people they kidnap (and grudgingly have to release for a Comically Small Bribe of some alcohol) are a Defiant Captive who won't beg to be released for money, a Mock Millionaire, and a Spoiled Brat whose fiancee refuses to pay for her release.
-   _Jennifer-the-Jerk Is Missing_ has a group of kidnappers who can't stand their 8-year-old charge, who is a colossal Jerkass for her age, and keeps complaining and mocking everything and everybody (yes, even the people trying to save her) through the book. By the time the protagonists find Jennifer, she is notably tied to a chair and gagged, while her adult valet who was abducted with her is less restrained, even if he is nursing a severe concussion.
    
    **Kidnapper:** That kid's driving me nuts! I'm restraining myself all the time! I keep wanting to bust her in the chops every time she opens that big mouth of hers!
    
-   Happened in the novel _Jimmy The Kid_ (a sequel to _The Hot Rock_) by Donald Westlake, and the movie based on the book.
-   In a Polish poem, _Pani Twardowska_, the Devil comes to claim the soul of a wizard, Sir Twardowski, after he visits Rome (accidentally, an inn Twardoski just happens to visit is called "Rome"). There was, however, a part of the deal that allowed Twardowski to give the Devil three last tasks, and failing one would result in breaking the deal. The first task is to build a cathedral from various absurd materials like Jews' beards and in an impossibly short time, which the Devil manages. The second is to bathe in holy water, which he, very reluctantly, forces himself to. The third task is to live with Mrs. Twardowska. The Devil gives up.
-   O. Henry's "The Ransom of Red Chief" is a Trope Codifier. The titular "Red Chief" (what the kid calls himself in his first game, Cowboys and Indians) is so awful, that the _kidnappers_ had to pay a ransom to his father to take him back! Totally understandable, as the kid was no mere Bratty Half-Pint, but rather both a Motor Mouth and a precocious Magnificent Bastard. One memorable scene involves one of the kidnappers being ambushed in his sleep and nearly scalped with his own knife.
    
    _"What you getting up so soon for, Sam?" asked Bill._  
    _"Me?" says I. "Oh, I got a kind of a pain in my shoulder. I thought sitting up would rest it."_  
    _"You're a liar!" says Bill. "You're afraid. You was to be burned at sunrise, and you was afraid he'd do it."_
    
    -   When the hapless duo _did_ finally get the boy back home, he wanted to stay and play with his abductors, so his own father had to hold him back to give them time to flee on foot, with the fat Bill outrunning his fitter counterpart by a mile and a half in his haste to leave the terror behind.
-   In _Ratbags and Rascals_, a collection of short stories by Robin Klein, 'The Kidnapping of Clarissa Montgomery' is an example of this. Clarissa is an obnoxious Rich Bitch who complains constantly and bullies her kidnappers into submission, forcing them to learn French verbs, beating them at cards and even sending out her own ransom note and collecting the briefcase with the ransom in it as she can't trust the kidnappers to do a good job. The briefcase contains no money, just a note from her guardian saying 'Do not want Clarissa back. She is too irritating and bossy. You can keep her. Glad to get rid of her.' Clarissa then takes over the gang.
-   The kidnappers in "The Snatching of Bookie Bob" by Damon Runyon successfully get a $25,000 ransom for him. Unfortunately for them, they spent their time waiting for the payment gambling with Bob, and end up owing him $50,000.
-   In _The Voyage of the Dawn Treader_, Eustace is such a miserable person to be around that the slave-dealers who kidnap the crew cannot sell him and try, without success, to give him away for free.
-   _Wagons West_: in _Montana!_, the Indians come to regret having captured the three women, as they have created a bunch of complications from demanding proper eating utensils to wanting to interview the chief.
-   _When The Robbers Came To Cardamom Town_: The robbers kidnap aunt Sophie so that she can cook and clean for them. She immediately turns this around and makes them wash and clean not only their home, but themselves as well! When constable Bastian, the baker and the sausage maker show up to save her, she doesn’t want to leave, because she’s determined to make the robbers into decent people. In the end the robbers can’t take her ordering them around anymore, and when she falls asleep, they return her to her home.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Angel_ combines this one with Enfante Terrible in "I've Got You Under My Skin": after discovering a young boy is possessed by a demon, Angel Investigations exorcises it and then tracks its physical form down to kill it... a fate the demon welcomes, as the little boy was so evil by himself that the demon found himself trapped in a hellish mindscape for years.
-   On _The A-Team_, in the season 3 episode "Bounty", resident lunatic Murdock is abducted by bounty hunters thinking they can use him to find the team. He manages to drive them crazy before they even get back to their hideout.
-   _Babylon 5_ presents a nonantagonistic version: Garibaldi arrests G'Kar for assaulting Londo Mollari (long story). Sometime later, Garibaldi notes that a petition was passing around because the station population thought Garibaldi's men were torturing G'Kar. What was _actually_ happening was that G'Kar was singing to pass the time. But that wasn't what got him out early. Instead, the station was about to go under martial law and Garibaldi needed his security out on the beat, not guarding an otherwise model prisoner.
-   _Doctor Who_: In "The Fires of Pompeii", Donna is abducted by the Sibylline Sisterhood while the Doctor's back is turned. When he shows up to rescue her, neither of them are very concerned about the fact that Donna was about to become a Human Sacrifice (mainly for blasphemy, but also for being, well, _Donna_).
-   On _Dynasty (2017)_, Fallon is abducted and quickly drives her kidnappers nuts by complaining about them only asking for $15 million for her, cutting her hair into bangs, and complaining about her surroundings like it's a hotel. And _then_, they also net Fallon's step-mother Cristal so the two women bitch at each other constantly.
-   _Fantasy Island_ had a B-plot that involved two kidnappers trying to ransom Tattoo. He and Mr. Roarke are both quite familiar with the Red Chief story, referred to above, and Tattoo is roughly child-sized...
-   _Father Brown_: The robbers in "The Great Train Robbery" who abduct Mrs McCartney and Lady Felecia to cover their getaway soon regret it. The two women are soon directing their behaviour and dictating the ransom note.
-   On _General Hospital_, after being kidnapped by goons working for her husband's enemies, Laura Spencer proceeded to drive them crazy with her mood swings, demands, and cravings—she was 5-6 months pregnant—then genuinely began to worry them by complaining of abdominal pains. Her husband burst in to save her just as one of them decided to relent and release her, at which point it turned out she'd been faking everything.
-   An episode of _Grimm_ has a Wesen with a grudge against Sean Renard kidnap his young daughter Diana. When the kidnapper first calls Renard, the latter starts to panic at first, then he remembers that Diana is _the most powerful Hexenbiest in history_ and no moral qualms about torture and murder. So, the next several times the kidnapper calls, Sean reacts very casually, doing everyday things, such as going out for a jog, figuring the guy will eventually beg him to take Diana back. Yeah, that's exactly what happens, and Diana even asks Sean if she can come back and "play" some more with the guy later, much to the horror of the kidnapper, who has been beaten to a pulp by the girl's Mind over Matter abilities.
-   On _Hawaii Five-0_, a pair of kidnappers are abducting the teenage daughters of a rich private school for ransom. The cops are thrown to find their bodies in a van and figure their latest victim must have gotten lucky and gotten away. As it happens, the "schoolgirl" is actually a North Korean spy who had been posing as a teenager to get closer to a local Army Intelligence officer. Too late, her captors realized they were dealing with a very lethal agent.
-   The protagonists of _Hogan's Heroes_ were technically POWs, but this Trope could apply a lot. In fact, in one episode, Col. Hogan made a public announcement over a radio (giving support to the German army that was obviously sarcasm) that even got Hitler's attention. Hitler's orders were: "If this man ever tries to escape, LET him!"
-   In the first season finale of _Killing Eve_, Villanelle kidnaps Irina, Konstantin's young daughter. Irina responds to being dragged all over Moscow by a hotheaded psychopath who has a gun by... arguing with her, screaming at her, and in general going out of her way to _make damn sure_ that Villanelle is just as miserable as she is. Konstantin even predicted this would happen.
    
    **Konstantin:** I need to find my daughter. She's going to drive that woman _crazy_.  
    **Kenny:** Is she really annoying?  
    **Konstantin:** _\[choking back tears\]_ She's so annoying. She's amazing, but _so annoying_.
    
-   In _M\*A\*S\*H_, a pair of North Korean infiltrators drop Major Burns off on the road. In the brief conversation that ensues, they explain that they don't need a hostage anymore, he's driving them crazy, they're not in the mood to torture him, and he should go back to the 4077th because it's the best thing he can do "to help our side."
    -   A few seasons later, Major Winchester hires a North Korean spy as a houseboy. In one of his last communications to his people, the spy replies "And in regard to kidnapping Major Winchester for questioning, forget it. He is one big jerk."
-   This happens in an episode of _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_, but it's unique in that the victim _intentionally_ tries to drive the abductor nuts. Lord Zedd gets the idea of making Kimberly his queen, so orders Goldar to kidnap her and use a spell of mind control. The first part is successful, but the spell doesn't work for some reason; so Kimberly pretends it does, doing a rather good impression of Rita, which reminds Goldar only too well how bad a temper she has. He doesn't let Kimberly go (although it is hinted he wants to), but the act does distract him long enough for Billy to find them.
-   One episode of _Murphy Brown_ had Murphy get kidnapped by a group of activists who wanted more publicity for their cause. She eventually annoyed them to the point where they let her go (The fact that everyone they tried to announce her kidnapping to either thought Murphy was pranking them or decided You Can Keep Her! didn't help).
-   _The Nanny_: From the end of "The Bank Robber":
    
    **Fran:** Oh, my God! That poor man!
    
-   Subverted in an episode of _Stargate SG-1_; the team gates into a museum and ends up taking a security guard (and a bunch of guests) hostage until they can find a way to gate out. When the security guard has made himself into enough of a pest, Mitchell simply duct tapes his mouth shut.
    
    **Mitchell:** Should have thought of that sooner.
    
-   On _Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt_, in the season 3 episode "Kimmy Steps On A Crack," aspiring cult-leader Gretchen turns out to have kidnapped a bunch of teenage boys to keep as "child brides." While they are less rumbunctious than most examples on this list, and just sort of messy, lazy and useless, the result is still this trope, as Gretchen finds herself spending all her time cooking for them, cleaning up after them, and generally acting like their mother.
-   _Weeds_: Celia Hodes is kidnapped by her daughter and her boyfriend the rebel leader. They intend to ransom her, but no one is interested. They then plan to sell off her organs for cash but find out she's had chemotherapy so no one will want them. Celia then "makes herself useful" e.g. by organizing the rebels' firearms, but manages to provoke a fight between her daughter and the rebel leader, breaking up their relationship. The daughter leaves, and the rebel leader lets Celia go.
-   _Young Sheldon_: In "A Therapist, a Comic Book, and a Breakfast Sausage", Sheldon goes somewhere without telling anyone, making his parents frantic as they try to track him down. George attempts to lighten the mood by saying that there's no way Sheldon is being held prisoner somewhere; after a very short while, the kidnapper would beg them to take him back.

    Music 

-   To add a male example, German folk song "Des Schneiders Höllenfahrt". Devils drag a tailor to hell so he makes them new clothes. They are in for a world of pain. _Seitdem holt der Teufel keine Schneider mehr, es gehe, wie es wöll._ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   The old Irish song "Killieburne Brae" is about a loud and annoying woman who is dragged off to hell, then terrorizes the demons there in all kinds of colourful ways. She is eventually sent back to her husband, with the moral that "women are worse than the men/when they go down to hell they are truant again."
    -   "Scolding Wife" doesn't go so far, but does include the line:
        
        _And if the Devil would take her, I'd thank him for his pain_
        
    -   Heather Dale covered this song under the title "The Farmer's Curst Wife"
-   Heather Alexander performed a similar song, "The Devil and the Farmer's Wife."
    
    "Now I've been a devil for most o' me life, but I ne'er was in Hell 'til I met with your wife."
    
-   Brazilian song "Sequestraram a Minha Sogra", by artist Bezerra da Silva, the title of which translates to "They Kidnapped My Mother-In-Law". As the story in the song goes, the kidnapper _had to pay a ransom to return her_.

    Radio 

-   Happened more than once with Sub-Lieutenant Phillips in _The Navy Lark_. He was kidnapped several times, and virtually every time the Troutbridge crew had to be forced to take him back for reasons of either annoyance or if he cooperated with his kidnappers he ended up doing more damage to them than armed opposition would have.
-   The _Stanley Baxter's Playhouse_ episode "Two Desperate Men" is "The Ransom of Red Chief" in 1930s Perthshire. They finally decide they have to return him when he tries to drive their car and nearly crashes it. The father takes the car as part of the anti-ransom, and the story ends with them walking to Glasgow.
    
    **Hughie**: You tried to set me on fire! You are a very bad boy!
    
    **Logan**: You're a kidnapper, so you can't tell me off. Now I'm going to sleep for a bit, but when I wake, you're getting burnt proper.
    

    Theatre 

-   The play _Bones_ by Peter Straughen is made of this trope - although in a fun variant, instead of being annoying, the 'kidnappee' (Reg Kray) is just a dangerous, badass gangster, and something of a Magnificent Bastard who soon has his kidnappers either terrified or practically in love with him.

    Video Games 

-   In a bit of background conversation in _Diablo III_, an old soldier and his wife reminisce about the time she was kidnapped by barbarians, and the soldier describes how he was beside himself until they brought her back with an apology. His wife comments that their leader still sends her a bundle of hides every year.
-   Discussed in _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_. An example of this trope doesn't actually occur in the game, but, given Serra's personality, it becomes quickly apparent why Erk would come to this conclusion about her.
-   In _The Last Remnant_, a sidequest involves rescuing a merchant's son from kidnappers. The catch? The son is a yama, a race of 10-foot-tall powerhouses (and said son is one of the larger ones), and the three kidnappers are qsiti, a race of 2-foot-tall reptilian creatures, with knives that would barely scratch the yama's skin. Rush even says something to the effect of "Which one of them actually needs help?"
-   Used in _Serious Sam II_, where the literal dragon, after kidnapping the hilariously ugly princess, decided to surrender her to Sam without a fight; he refuses, and they fight over who has to take her. Sam wins and agrees to take her if he can also take the magic artifact he was after.
-   In a comical skit in _Tales of Destiny 2_, Nanaly Fletch imagines herself being a Damsel in Distress. Then Loni Dunamis offers to be her Knight in Shining Armor... because he pities any villains that kidnap Nanaly for her tomboy-ness. Cue to the bonecrusher.
-   _Team Fortress 2_: The Soldier, a deranged, jingoistic gung-ho idiot with No Indoor Voice, claims to have spent time in POW camps...and all of them broke before he did. Of course, this being the Soldier, whether those were _actually_ POW camps is somewhat ambiguous.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   Subverted on _7-Second Riddles_. One of the potential solutions for a riddle involves annoying a kidnapper into freeing you, but it's the wrong answer; the correct answer is to try and befriend the kidnapper, to make it harder for them to hurt you.
-   Both times that The Annoying Orange got kidnapped by Jigsaw.
-   In an episode from _BlackBoxTV_ (a serious horror example of this trope), a couple kidnap a young girl with the intent to force her family to pay for her back, but then don't hear anything. No police report, no callback on their ransom, nothing. The couple, a man who does have some level of moral compass and a woman with a drug habit and surly attitude, begin becoming frustrated. Eventually, the kidnapped girl turns the tables, using her supernatural powers to lock the woman in her bedroom and viciously attack her with a supernatural teddy bear with razor teeth and sharp claws. The kidnapped girl then forces both the man and woman to become her "perfect parents", acting like a nuclear family out of the '50s. Should they refuse, the kidnapped girl will kill them both with her powers. It is essentially implied that the parents of the girl didn't want her back as this was the life they were forced to live as well, and likely split the second they were free.
-   Subverted in episode 6 of _Helluva Boss_. When Blitzo and Moxxie are captured by a pair of human agents and interrogated, they annoy the agents into walking out of the room to consider different tactics. While they are in another room they listen in on the two and find out their plan of annoying the agents until they give up and release them, and the Agents gas them with Truth Serum in response.
-   An episode of _RWBY Chibi_ has Cinder kidnapping Jaune and Ren. Jaune sings the Camp Camp theme song to successfully annoy Cinder into throwing them out of the car.

    -   Yakko and Dot challenge Death at checkers to bring Wakko back to life, with their lives at stake. Death exploits Exact Words so he can take all three of them (they asked to "be with their brother again") — but then he realizes he'll have to host the three loons in the underworld for all eternity, and he lets them go. In other episodes, they get Dracula and Satan to let them go for the same reason. They subvert their own pattern in a later episode, as this _fails_ to work on an Army drill sergeant; he just assigns them to worse duties. That is until he can finally stand it no longer, goes insane, and becomes a camp counselor.
    -   One episode features something so horrible, even the Warner siblings can't deal with it: Baloney the Dinosaur. Even dropping multiple anvils on him only gains them a temporary respite.

-   _The Boondocks_ had this happen twice in the episode "Let's Nab Oprah". In an attempt to kidnap Oprah Winfrey from a book signing, the bumbling duo Ed Wuncler III and Gin Rummy accidentally kidnap Maya Angelou instead. They have to dump her out of the van after she starts repeatedly kicking Gin Rummy. The two try again by breaking into Oprah's studio, but they end up going into Bill Cosby's dressing room instead. They decide to cut their losses and just kidnap _him_, but he's so annoying they have to let him go fifteen minutes later.
-   In the Bugs Bunny cartoon "Bugs and Thugs", Bugs is kidnapped by a pair of gangsters. He drives them so crazy that when the police arrive, the criminals beg the cops to arrest them to get them away from him.
    -   The same gag is used in the earlier "Racketeer Rabbit".
        -   Locking the baddies in a stove, _turning the gas on_, and then throwing a match in to explode it is really a whole new level of "driving crazy".

However, Mugman proves to be still be cheerful and hoping Cuphead will save him, even when the heat is turned up and being told his brother is dead after 80 years<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . By the time Cuphead reaches the Underworld, it's the Devil himself who's near broken after trying to torture Mugman all day, to his lampshaded frustration.
    
    **The Devil:** Oh, come on! I've been torturing you all day. Will you just break already?  
    **Mugman:** I really don't know what you're talking about.  
    **The Devil:** _\[grumbles and walks away in a huff\]_

-   In _The Life and Times of Juniper Lee_ episode "The World According to LARP", the demon warlord Maret told his two moronic henchmen to nab June's younger brother Ray Ray as a hostage, but they nabbed her teenage brother Dennis himself.
