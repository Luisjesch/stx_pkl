A character, or mass of characters, that are used for breeding without having a choice in the matter.

Reasons behind this include: belief that it will promote scientific interest, belief that it will make future generations stronger, belief that it will assimilate a group, belief that it will assert dominance of (and "breed out") a race, practical means for turning a Slave Race into a Servant Race, or even attempting to ensure the survival of a race following a large tragedy in the most relatively benign cases. Or baser reasons like Lust or Ego.

Regardless, don't expect them to care about the victim's feelings on the matter. When it involves sex, by definition, this is a Rape Trope, since the person's consent is a non-issue. Even when the slave is _willing_, the fact that they _are_ a slave without any real ability to choose makes this Questionable Consent at best.

Sub-Trope to Chosen Conception Partner and Made a Slave, without the person having a choice in the matter. Is most often a specific form of a Sex Slave, though Speculative Fiction tropes can skip the sex entirely. Often used for titillation and Fanservice, especially in Fan Fiction and Pornography, but it's also used to help to show just how insane, corrupt, or downright evil the enemy is.

This almost always involves a female being forced to bear offspring for an enemy group, though it does occur with males as well. When a male is the victim of a female, it's generally played as comedic, desirable, and/or a mark of the male's sexual prowess. In the rare case when a male victim is taken seriously, he's almost always killed after the woman confirms her pregnancy (or immediately after sex).

Sister Trope to Accidental Pornomancer. Often overlaps with Mars Needs Women, Mate or Die, or Abduction Is Love. Might also overlap with Lady Land or No Woman's Land. If female (or male in some stories), they may be a Baby Factory. Eunuchs — castrated men, often enslaved — are the inverse of this trope, historically considered useful in a Standard Royal Court precisely because they _can't_ breed and thus can't threaten succession by founding upstart dynasties or knocking up the ladies of the Royal Harem.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  See also People Farms.

**NOTE: Though it's undoubted that this has happened in Real Life at various points in human history, _no real-life examples should be posted._**

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Berserk_: The Midland women captured by Emperor Ganishka's forces are put in a magic device that infuses their unborn child with demonic energies, turning it into a demon called a Daka. The Daka then bursts its way out of the womb, killing the host, as a way to strengthen the demonic army.
-   _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_: During chapter 16, Hana reveals it was the Japanese government who created Blowjob. They captured Zenovia and performed experiments on her to learn the secret of her strength, but their instruments couldn't pierce her body. So they resorted to having her repeatedly raped and impregnated by supervillains until they had an army of offspring with superpowers. Which is what caused Zenovia to turn to villainy and seek revenge against all of humanity.
-   In the last part of the _Karin_ manga, it's revealed that this is what happened basically to every incarnation of Sophia "Spirit of Psyche" Pistis, a female vampire with the ability of bestowing fertility on other vampires, which is very important since they're a Dying Race. For thousands of years, she was reborn within the body of a vampire of the Armash bloodline (Karin's maternal family) and forced to have a child to continue that bloodline. And this would have ultimately happened _to Karin herself_ (aka the latest Psyche) had her Badass Family not gone into a Roaring Rampage of Rescue _and_ given her Laser-Guided Amnesia so that she could have a normal life and break this "cycle"... Ultimately, Sophia was reincarnated again as Karin and Kenta's daughter Kanon and was able to "rest".
-   In _Monster Musume_, Miia was supposed to bring back a human male to breed with her entire village because lamias are all born female and this is their only way to perpetuate the species. On screen, this only happens in a Dream Sequence where Miia imagines her "darling" Kimihito in this situation, eventually too exhausted to do it when her turn comes.
-   In _World's End Harem_, exactly five men in the whole world survive the purge which a virus carried on against all other men on Earth. The surviving women rose to power and now demand that these five men produce children that can bring about a new human race, one of which was denied the "demand" and was _outright_ kidnapped into a life of sexual slavery.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Arak: Son of Thunder_, the Black Pope has women kidnapped and turned into sex slaves and breeding stock in huge numbers, gloating about his intent to invade the surface with those bred for it.
-   In _The Authority_, Regis Slzfi headed an empire on an alternate Earth that turned all of China into a rape camp in an attempt for his dying race to produce offspring.
-   _Batman_: In one story-line in _Tales of the Dark Knight_, Batman, who had just started working as a vigilante, actually enjoys what he does until he meets the Monster of the Week — the son of a Nazi female scientist who looks down on him but grows somewhat fond of Batman, trying to get him to have a child with her. Partially through her son's help, Batman manages to escape and swears to never think of what he does as 'fun' ever again.
-   In _Paranoia,_ the protagonist King is drugged into being one — he comes home from work, gets pulled onto the sofa for sex with his wife Ala, then leaves the room... only to enter _another_ room and repeat it over and over. It is a ruse by a secret society to induce pregnancy and record the process for training purposes.
-   _Preacher_: The Grail has turned _Jesus Christ's descendants_ (with Mary Magdalena) into this, keeping them in a cage, and forcing brother and sister to interbreed to "keep His bloodline pure". The sole surviving descendant is catastrophically inbred and obviously lacks any divine powers, but the Grail is intent on pushing him as the new Messiah. Herr Starr decides to take over the Grail because they're so blind to reality.
-   _R.E.B.E.L.S._ reveals in the 22nd issue of Volume 2 that Psions procreate by enslaving their women and forcing them to undergo impregnation against their will.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: After attacking and enslaving their men, the villainous women of Mercury keep them around for hard labor and reproduction purposes.
    -   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: The Amazons of Bana-Mighdall have perpetuated their tribe by offering a select few of their male opponents the chance to survive by becoming their breeding slaves. They keep the men in stalls like animals.
    -   _Wonder Woman (2011)_: The New 52 established rather shockingly where Amazons come from and repopulate their ranks. Turns out like Sirens they find nearby ships of sailors; have relations with them and upon which they kill the Men and throw them overboard.

    Fanfiction 

-   In _Wish Carefully_, eight magically powerful girls between the ages of 13 to 25, collectively known as the Cabal, were kidnapped to be breeding stock for the higher ranks of the Death Eaters as a solution meant to inject some fresh new blood into their small gene pool. The girls are continuously impregnated until the end of their fertile years with their children either being taken from them or to share their fate.
-   In _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, the Bloodline King orders his Emissary to kidnap Misty's older sisters to be used to breed more Bloodliner children.
-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_: Malleus's slaves, who also doubled as Sex Slaves, as said:
    
    To Malleus, the poor girls chained naked to the walls were nothing but objects of convenience, there to sate his lusts and produce offspring.
    
-   _Khaos Omega_ puts an interesting twist on the concept, thanks primarily to a trap orchestrated in 2811: Because of how much experience she's had with two special pregnancy-themed upgrades Jet had picked up (one in 2020, the other in 2210), Anise is given an "ability", permanently active, that causes any eligible release inside her to automatically impregnate her. Due to it, she's essentially a "perfect" breeding slave, especially to the Echo Hornets (whose co-leaders Fontina Evans and Michaela Martin orchestrated the trap and gave her the "ability" in the first place). She'll willingly enter such a mode on other occasions, including one that led to her unlocking a new power simply classified as "Beyond Diva" through a revelation from a friend of the girl Anise took a breeding slave-themed trap for.
-   in the _Firefly_ fanfic _Salvage Mission_, Jayne Cobb is tracked down by Captain Mal after being tortured and later sold into slavery by the Alliance. The plantation owner says he sent Jayne to the breeders soon after buying him because he hoped the muscular Jayne would put size and strength into his offspring. It didn't last long because they inherited Jayne's stubborn,ornery streak, but it took a big toll on Jayne. After Mal buys Jane and gets him safely on the shuttle he's flying, Jayne breaks down, telling Mal how the girls could be as young as 13 and between breeding and birthing, their bodies got wrecked and they could die. He indicates it was closer to rape for him, too, saying they'd give him drugs to stop him refusing and somehow leaving him no choice in doing it.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   The villainous, eponymous monsters in the _Alien_ franchise do this to any species they encounter, specifically humans. By design, the Xenomorphs were created to invoke every possible means and horrific result of rape, including impregnation. As such, those humans they don't kill they typically bring back to and cocoon within their nest, where they will be impregnated by a facehugger. The "birthing" process, however, is fatal.
-   In _Bone Tomahawk_, The female Troglodytes are literally nothing but baby factories, because all of their limbs are cut off and their eyes are cut out.
-   _Conan the Barbarian (1982)_: During his stint as a gladiatorial slave, Conan was, shall we say, put to stud.
-   In _Don't Breathe_, the Blind Man has been keeping Cindy - the woman who killed his daughter - prisoner in his basement until she agreed to have his child (via artificial insemination). After she is killed, he attempts to use Rocky for the same purpose.
-   _Evil Breed: The Legend of Samhain_: While attempting to escape the cannibal lair, Shae finds an American tourist (identified in the credits only as 'The Breeder') who has just given birth to a stillborn baby. She is being held prisoner so the cannibals can bred from her: the Cannibal Clan being so inbred that their females are now all sterile.
-   In _Mad Max: Fury Road_, Immortan Joe's five "Wives" are this, with each being given three chances to bear him a healthy male child before being cast out. If the implications about the "milk mothers" who are treated like livestock and constantly milked to provide sustenance to the Warboys is true, he's gone through quite a few of them. The plot of the movie concerns Furiosa betraying Joe to liberate his five current "Wives", leading to Joe launching a relentless chase after her to get them back.
-   In _Timber Falls_, Ida and Clyde kidnap Sheryl and Mike and attempt to force them to conceive a child for Ida to raise. From The Teaser, we know this is not the first time they have tried this.
-   _Vampire Diary_: Vicki tells Holly her mom was used this way by the male vampires, getting pregnant with vampire babies repeatedly while living in a house they kept her in for this purpose. Her sister and her were going to become this too, before Vicki ran away.

    Literature 

-   _Animorphs_:
    -   The first two free Hork-Bajir mention this in "The Change".
    -   In the Alternate Timeline shown in "The Familiar", humans being bred is also mentioned. In this case, it's rather easy to do given that Puppeteer Parasite powers are used.
-   In _Aria the Scarlet Ammo_, Vlad abducted Riko Mine Lupin after her parent's death and kept her in a cage in the hopes of assimilating her genes, as he did with many people before (since she descends from a very powerful family). But since after some experiments he considers her a genetic failure, he intends to use her to produce a child that he could actually use. Whether he means fathering the child himself isn't made explicit though — the series isn't _that_ dark.
-   The main villains of the _Bazil Broketail_ novels use this as their main means of producing soldiers. Human women are used to breed imps as their primary infantry unit and animals are used in a similar fashion to breed their heavy units like trolls and ogres.
-   _The Belgariad_: The Dryads, who have only females, capture human males to reproduce with.
-   In the _Black Jewels_ books, this overlaps with Sex Slave for Damon and Lucivar, although due to various reasons the baddies never actually succeed in getting them to impregnate anyone.
-   The whole reason the cribs exist in _A Brother's Price_ is so that women who can't afford husbands can get pregnant by the men held captive in said cribs.
-   _The Chronicles of Dorsa_: Akella learns her crew have been turned into this in Persepos after their capture for the Order of Targhan (an all female group). They have fathered a dozen children or so, with their shadow infection rendering them obedient drones. Additionally, they're the caretakers of the children. She's outraged with her crew being used as "stud horses" like this and frees them.
-   In _Goblin Slayer_, the goblins often subject the women they capture to this treatment, as goblins in this series are an all-male One-Gender Race and can't reproduce except with women from other races like humans or elves. This means every goblin is a Child by Rape, and the whole race exists solely to Rape, Pillage, and Burn, and the more women they can capture, the faster they can grow their population, and the bigger a threat they can become. The women involved are killed when the goblins have no more use for them, and those that survive are often traumatized for life. They also don't take particularly good care of their captives; Shield Maiden, one of the survivors, had her eyes ruined in the process.
-   Mentioned in John Norman's _Gor_ series. Sex Slaves are common, and it's mentioned that there are bred slaves. The dominance/submission issues involved are often explored.
-   Handmaids in _The Handmaid's Tale_ by Margaret Atwood. Women of reproductive age who had "lived in sin" by the standards of the Republic of Gilead are sent to the Rachel and Leah Re-education Center. After being re-educated, the Handmaid then stays with an upper-class family and is regularly raped by the Commander in the hopes that she will get pregnant with a live, unmutated baby on behalf of his barren Wife. If she fails, she gets two more chances with this with two other families. If she fails those, then she's sent to the Colonies.

-   Tindwyl in the Brandon Sanderson _Mistborn_ novels was used as a breeding slave in the Lord Ruler's breeding program for the Terris people.
-   _Orc Eroica_: Orcs habitually took female prisoners as sex slaves during the war because they're a One-Gender Race that must reproduce using females of other species, and by orcish tradition, they had to have defeated the woman in combat. One of the concessions of the peace treaty with the victorious human-led alliance is that the humans provide the orcs with female prison inmates to breed with so that their species doesn't die out.
-   _The Power_: The few (10%) of men left in Bessapara are used as "studs" to impregnate the ruling women, with no other purpose.
-   In _Re:Monster_, goblins are pretty weak monsters but can reproduce quickly, with gestation taking 20-25 days and baby goblins reaching sexual maturity in another ~30 days. However, female goblins have a low fertility rate, so some tribes will capture women of other races in order to make more goblins faster. The main character, Rou, was actually a human who died and got reincarnated as a goblin. When he first sees the half-dozen human women (with no idea which one is his mother) his tribe keeps for recreational and breeding purposes, every one of them is an Empty Shell, not even able to speak due to the psychological trauma. He secretly brings them deadly poison so they can choose whether to take their own lives. They all do. Some time later, when his tribe captures more human women, Hoburou challenges the tribe leader to a duel, beats him, takes control of the tribe, and forbids them from kidnapping or raping any more innocent women. Though when attacked by elves, Rou does "convince" the resulting captives via drugs into being 'companions' for his tribe, which includes the men as well; after they give in and agree to it, they seem as well off as anyone else.
-   In _The Ship Who..._, this is the fate of women captured by the Kolnari, and all their female children and grandchildren for several generations until they're considered to have produced low-caste Kolnari. Male children are castrated and made to work in demeaning positions such as medics. Whether female Kolnari capture people for this purpose for this is unknown, though they do torment them, as do male Kolnari who like men.
-   Salt wives in _A Song of Ice and Fire_ are often this, frequently being women captured by the Ironborn and then used to make children.
-   _Star Wars Legends_: Kuati nobles are said in _The Bounty Hunter Wars_ to keep _telbun_, slaves used for both recreational and procreative sex. In _X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble_ Erisi Dlarit and Corran Horn use a Kuati noblewoman and her _telbun_ as their cover ID during The Infiltration, and Erisi tells an Imperial customs agent that she's come to Coruscant with her _telbun_ to conceive, following family tradition.
-   In _Time Enough for Love_ Lazarus Long recounts a time he bought a brother-sister "breeding pair" of genetically modified slaves with the intent to free them on a planet where two hundred years before he himself had been made a slave. In fact, the two he bought turned out to be his great-great-great-grandchildren.
-   Male Ayyad from the _The Wheel of Time_. They are not taught anything and only basically know how to feed and dress themselves. They have no names and are referred to as "the male". At age 16 they are hooded, cloaked and presented to any female Ayyad that want children. At age 21 "the male" is studded again then executed and cremated.
-   In the second _The Wolf Chronicles_ novel, it is revealed that when Borlla had vanished in the first book, she had not died as her packmates thought, but instead was being kept as a slave by the Greatwolves to breed with so that the Greatwolves don't become too inbred. A few other young wolves, including males, are also being kept by them for the same purpose.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In an episode of _Buck Rogers in the 25th Century_, men are lured to the planet Zanthia, which has become an artificial Lady Land following the capture of the entire male population as prisoners of war, to serve as slave studs. Luckily for Buck, the woman for whom he's purchased (and dressed in as fetishy an outfit as you'll see on a man on American TV in the 1970s) is more interested in rebelling against her mother, the Prime Minister who instigated the slave policy.
-   _Earth: Final Conflict_: Lily Marquette gets captured by aliens and used for breeding.
-   _The Handmaid's Tale_: This is the Handmaids' role, to provide children for the Commanders.
-   In _Helix_ it is shown the immortal Michael maintained a forced breeding dungeon to accomplish his wish to have an immortal child (2x10 - Mother).
-   _Sliders_:
    -   Wade is written out by being captured by CroMags and sent to a breeding center.
    -   The episode "Love Gods", where all males are rounded up and used for breeding (with human females who are lucky enough), including Quinn.
-   In _Stargate SG-1_ the Jaffa do double-duty as Slave Mooks and as living incubators for Goa'uld larvae. It's not purely a one-sided deal though, as the larvae push the host Jaffa's system far beyond the abilities of any normal human being, such as increased durability and strength.

    Mythology & Religion 

-   One of Heracles' lesser-known feats occurred during his stay with the Amazons alongside Theseus. The queen, wanting to enjoy Theseus' company as long as possible, told them they were prisoners until Hercules had impregnated 50 Amazon women. Being, well, Hercules, he did so in _one night_.
-   _The Bible_:
    -   In the _Book of Genesis_, Rachel and Leah's maidservants Zilpah and Bilhah, respectively, become this for the two women that are married to Jacob. Rachel first sends Zilpah to conceive the children Rachel has been unable to (Joseph and Benjamin come quite a bit later), and when this is successful, Leah has a fit and sends Bilhah to Jacob's bed, with Bilhah conceiving as well.
    -   Later on, Jacob's firstborn son Reuben sleeps with Bilhah, and Jacob becomes so upset that upon his deathbed he denies Reuben the firstborn blessing. This wasn't Jacob being petty; by sleeping with one of his father's official sexual partners, under the custom of the time Reuben was asserting his place as head of the entire Israelite tribe - _before_ his father was in the grave. It was a _huge_ insult.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Imperium of Man in Warhammer 40,000 counts this amongst one of the many, _many_ tropes it exaggerates: It's a theocratic authoritarian nightmare of an empire whose main driving factor is that it can throw trillions upon trillions of people into the meatgrinder of a Forever War and have it be a viable tactic, but all those people have to come from somewhere. At least one Space Marine Chapter has 'Breeding _Worlds_' worlds. The Death Spectres recruit new members of the Chapter by scouring worlds for the best possible female candidates. They are taken to their homeworld of Occludus or nearby planets designated as "breeding worlds". The population of these Death Spectre-held planets are then supposed to breed future Aspirants. To support its "breeding worlds", the Chapter raids human-inhabited worlds of the Ghoul Stars; as a result, the local humans often regard the Death Spectres as just as dangerous as Xenos horrors. The details of them aren't disclosed, but considering their designation is distinct from the Hive Worlds whose chief export is also people, it's not hard to imagine what the people upon such worlds are subjected to.
    -   The Daemonculaba. Created by both the Iron Warriors and the Dark Mechanicum, these are breeding slaves used to create new Chaos Space Marines through an _outstandingly_ grotesque process. It starts with being 'unborn' as a mere mortal, and ends with being reborn as a slave to darkness.
-   _Dark Sun_ has the Muls, a race of human/dwarf hybrids which slave owners create by forcibly pairing human and dwarf slaves to produce a superior Servant Race — usually male dwarves with female humans, since human women tend to be more fertile (and more expendable) than dwarf women. Since muls avert the True-Breeding Hybrid trope unlike the more well-known half-elves and half-orcs, the population is literally only sustainable by the constant forcing of human/dwarf interbreeding by slave owners. They double as a form of Wicked Wastefulness, since the strain of bearing a mul infant often leaves the mother infertile or dead.

    Theatre 

-   In _A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum_ Fertila The Populator is a breeder slave purchased by the family to produce more slaves. She saves Pseudolus's life early on by refusing to mate with just any other breeder slave and insisting on having him as a choice.

    Video Games 

-   In _Dragon Age_, the Darkspawn often capture people alive and drag them back underground where they are force-fed the flesh and or blood of darkspawn. Men become ghouls while the women are turned into Brood Mothers — Huge, obese monstrosities riddled with Body Horror that do nothing but birth new Darkspawn.
-   In _Duke Nukem Forever_, there is a scene where women are captured, stripped, cocooned, and impregnated by alien creatures. Apparently, their bodies also _explode_ when the alien spawn emerges. Two recurring minor characters, the "Holsom Twins", suffer this fate while Duke quips sarcastically. This is widely considered to be the low point of the series.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   According to background information, the Breton race resulted from the selective breeding of high-ranking Aldmer men with especially attractive Nedic (human precursors) women they took as second wives/concubines. The Bretons would eventually out-populate either parent species in the region. Typically the children of a human/elf interbreeding would be the same race as their mother and only have a small number of minor traits from their father, but the Aldmer spent so long using Nedic women as their concubines and fathered so many children that elven characteristics became much more commonplace within the human population in High Rock and the Bretons became their own distinct race.
    -   St. Alessia, the "Slave Queen", was Born into Slavery in the Ayleid city of Sard, now known as Sardavar Leed. Sard was well known as a slave breeding center, and this likely would have been her fate had she not escaped. She would later lead the Alessian Revolt to overthrow the Ayleids and would be named as the first Empress of Cyrodiil.
-   In _Final Fantasy VII_, Hojo intends to force Aerith to become this for Red XIII, who fortunately disagrees. In the Stealth Sequel _Final Fantasy VII Remake_, he takes it even farther and suggests making her this for all of SOLDIER. The rest of SHINRA is disgusted by the idea.
-   _Saints Row: The Third_: Oleg was captured and used as a base for an army of physically powerful, but mentally flawed, clones, in a non-sexual example.
-   _Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness_: The building used to create dragon units consists of a chained-down dragon queen Alexstraza, forced to lay eggs to produce young that will fight for the Horde. You can even build several of her. This is averted via Retcon later; according to a book in _World of Warcraft_, she was forced to make her _adult_ children fight for the old Horde.
    -   Furthermore, Deathwing's plans included turning his "sisters" Alexstrasza and Ysera into this for himself, regardless of the fact that, after being corrupted by the Old Gods, his body turned so hot that he burned three of his consorts to death while trying to mate with them, with the fourth one barely surviving the mating, which gave her permanent burn scars.
-   _Pokémon_: It's a meta example, but anyone who has played their fair share of games may tell you how the Pokémon named Ditto is used. It can breed with any Pokémon except for anyone in the Undiscovered egg group, which mainly consists of Legendary Pokémon and Baby Pokémon. Some lampshade the tendency of players to use it for breeding by bypassing the censors and giving it offensive names on the Global Trading System. There's even memes about it..
-   _Mortal Kombat 11_
    -   Discussed in an intro between Cassie Cage and Kollector.
        
        **Cassie:** Earthrealm has nothing for you.  
        **Kollector:** My slavers need breeding stock.  
        **Cassie:** _Automatic no!_
        
    -   After besting Johnny Cage in the _Aftermath_ story, Sindel tells him that this is the future she has in mind for him and Sonya. Too bad for her Shang Tsung and Fire God Liu Kang had other plans.
-   A non-human version happens in _Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!_. A female A.I is mindwiped and the remaining factory default is used to massproduce robots. It's also an interesting example as it's the (arguably) _good guys_ who do this out of desperation, and had they had more time they would have used any other option.
-   In _Minecraft_, the player can do this if they construct a villager farm to breed villagers en-masse. This can be used to supply villagers for trading or to support an iron golem farm (as villagers spawn iron golems).
-   _Mass Effect_'s Krogan race inverts this trope. After being hit with the Genophage, which cuts their fertility rate by 99.9% to curb their Explosive Breeder biology, the Krogan are a Dying Race and fertile females are _insanely_ valuable, to the point where the backstory mentions fertile Krogan women using their fertility to acquire major political and military influence. Striking a fertile female is considered one of the worst crimes possible to the Krogan, and a clan of fertile females being threatened is one of the few things that will get all Krogan tribes to band together and defend the clan.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Sable's Grimoire: A Dragon's Treasure_, Sable believes that Drakan's father is such a slave, as the man is kept imprisoned in a block of crystal for centuries at a time and is released only when Drakan's mother wants to mate with him. Sable fears that he himself will meet the same fate if Drakan ever becomes a full dragon.

    Webcomics 

-   _Demonseed Redux_: The main war strategy for demons is to breed en-masse with non-demons and overwhelm the heaven with numbers. The lifespan of the slaves is rather short as a result.
-   In _Drowtales_ the warlord Quain'tana uses her daughter Mel'arnach as this after a timeskip, in return for not outright killing Mel earlier. This is because Quain'tana herself is unable to have any more children but needs to secure a blood-related heir to the clan and in fact took the protagonist, Ariel, from her real mother Mel as an infant for this purpose and Mel has had three children — two boys and a girl — in the 15 years after this deal was made. She was also used much more indirectly for this by her lover, Snadhya'rune, who took her genetic material under false pretenses and made a child who was carried to term in a Uterine Replicator. Mel has apparently failed to notice or deluded herself into ignoring the similarities between the two situations.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, according to Hedge, this was Damien's plan for Grace if he couldn't find enough chimeras to build himself an army.
-   When _Evon_ was captured by the Cabal Maximus attempted to use her to breed an army of super-sorcerers. He was only stopped by a higher-ranking Cabal member who wanted her for a different reason.
-   _Homestuck_'s Jake English is captured by a cyborg with the explicit purpose of being turned into one of these. Jake is completely broken by this and tries to isolate himself from others out of shame and self-loathing.
-   In _Unsounded_ this is the fate of any fertile woman in territory conquered by Alderode. After the dammakhert (a particular branch of the comic's version of magic) is 'installed'' and since any child conceived in the dammakhert is automatically sorted into one of the Aldish castes, the Aldish army instigates mass rape with the specific intention of breeding as many children as possible; both to replenish the castes back in Alderode and to erase the conquered people.

    Web Video 

-   Played for Laughs in _So This Is Basically..._ _Pokémon_ to poke fun at how a less-charitable interpretation of many of the game's mechanics is a whole lot of animal cruelty:
    
    Once in a while the game takes a break from brutal dogfights to remind you that Pokémon is about friendship. Oh, wait, this one doesn't have the nature I was looking for. Don't worry, _YOU CAN BE A BREEDING SLAVE!_
