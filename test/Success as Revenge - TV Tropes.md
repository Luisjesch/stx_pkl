_"Living well is the best revenge."_

— **George Herbert**, "Outlandish Proverbs", 1640

It is often said that Revenge is a dish Best Served Cold. However, some people think it's best not served at all.

Distinct from Forgiveness (though there can be overlap), this is when a character who _could_ seek revenge instead chooses not to. Not because they forgive their enemy or understand them, or because they worry that revenge will turn out to be ultimately unsatisfying, or even because seeking revenge would be impractical. But simply because they know it's better for them to live their own life. They might rub it in their enemy's faces if they get the chance, though. Other times, while the character will never take revenge, the audience will be shown how the enemy ruined their life through their own actions.

Essentially an aversion of Revenge Before Reason. Can also involve Know When to Fold 'Em. Not uncommon to involve Evil Cannot Comprehend Good, as their enemy cannot understand why anyone _wouldn't_ want revenge. Contrast Paranoia Gambit, where the important part of the revenge is to drive the enemy crazy believing you will perform a more regular revenge when you're doing this instead.

    Fan Works 

-   In part 2 of _Interviews with a Screenbug_, Taylor Hebert doesn't bother tormenting Emma when they finally meet again in Hollywood years later as she's already so successful that it's pointless. Instead, she offers a bit of genuine help in getting her an audition and the only revenge she gets is that Emma is auditioning to be an Alpha Bitch in a high school movie.
-   _Maria Campbell of the Astral Clocktower_: Sophia grew up an albino in a world where people take Albinos Are Freaks to an extreme, typically assuming they're all just reincarnations of Seath the Scaleless, an evil albino dragon. She was completely friendless until she met Katarina as a teenager, and she managed to grow up as a happy, mostly well-adjusted woman. Then she becomes a founding partner of Nightflower Factory, the first fireworks factory in the country, where she is making lots of money from this new fad. She takes manic glee in charging all her old bullies (and everyone else, but especially the bullies) an obscene amount of money. She's especially amused at how quickly the court whispers about her turn from calling her "that scaleless freak" to "that ethereal beauty."
-   The _My Hero Academia_ fanfic _Revenge is a Life Well Lived_ runs on this trope. When Dabi is sent back to past, his first thought is to kill his little brother Shouto and their Abusive father Endeavor for revenge. However, he instead kidnaps Shouto and decides to raise him, as a means of turning him against Endeavor. As the fic goes on, Dabi becomes more empathetic and attached, and in time he is satisfied with the life he builds and doesn't want to kill anyone. Instead he takes great pleasure in rubbing in Endeavor's face how much better off his family is without him.
-   _The Palaververse_: When talking about Saddle Arabian religion, they now believe that God Is Evil, hating their Creation and:
    
    its more philosophical inhabitants inclined to regard the very act of living happy lives as an act of defiance against the Creator.
    
-   _Wish Carefully_: As Lucius bitterly notes, while the Death Eaters and other dark-aligned figures are suffering in the Hell that their own ideologies created, Harry Potter, as well his fellow Light-aligned friends and family, have been noted to be living it up in the new magical society they created in the Pacific Islands, with Harry being rumored to have fathered _a dozen_ children. Voldemort was not happy when he learned about this and it only drove him further into Ax-Crazy madness.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Legally Blonde_: Elle goes out of her way to attend the same law school as the boy who dumped her, hoping in parts to win him back and in parts to show him up.

    Literature 

-   _Cradle Series_: Lindon was spat on and mistreated his entire life by the people of Sacred Valley, who saw him as a cripple who couldn't do anything useful. He spent that life trying to make something of himself regardless and never considered fighting back. When he discovered that a great catastrophe was coming, he left the Valley to train to become strong enough to defeat it. When he finally comes back, he tries to get all his old enemies to evacuate. They _cannot_ understand why he would possibly want to help them, assume it's all a trick, and try to murder him multiple times.
-   _Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs_: In volume 1, after befriending both Livia and Angie, Leon advises them that the best revenge on their respective opponents (Livia's bullies, Angie's ex-fiancé and his new girlfriend) is to be happy, because directly taking revenge on somebody is too much work for too little gain. Leon's way, the other person will see you being happy despite them and it'll make them miserable.
    
    "Classic revenge takes an insane amount of effort, and it only makes the other person unhappy. Meanwhile, you don't really get anything in the process. You both go down together. If you're going to spend that much effort on something, you might as well spend it on making yourself happy."
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Atlanta_: After leaving Princeton (for what's revealed to be a very minor misdemeanor that gets escalated out of all control or proportion), Earn says that he was motivated to come back to Atlanta and make a success of his life to show them he didn't need them. He does ultimately earn a lot of success, but the implication gets deconstructed in "The Homeliest Little Horse". Earn discusses at therapy that, while all the success has given him a lot of material benefits, he's never really faced his past so his success doesn't mean as much. He eventually comes around to it, though.
-   _Harry & Meghan_ ends with the titular couple living their best life in a beautiful house in California, surrounded by family and friends. Harry, having been hounded by toxic British tabloids his entire life and feeling like his role in his family was to deflect criticism from his older brother, feels free and happy, though he misses his home country and friends he left behind.
-   _Seinfeld_: Discussed in the episode "The Revenge". George quits his job and when he tries to return, the boss won't hire him back and tells him he's a loser. George plans to get him back by slipping a mickey. Jerry suggests the best revenge is to live well, but George says there's no chance of that. And later in the episode, Jerry does a stand-up scene where he talks about the concept. He states that it wouldn't work in a Charles Bronson movie and goes on a spiel where Bronson has his family killed by thugs. A person suggests to Bronson he should get a new car, a custom-made suit, and a home makeover to get back at the thugs.

    Music 

-   R.E.M.: The opening track on _Accelerate_, "Living Well Is the Best Revenge", revolves around the narrator facing an onslaught of insults, attacks, and other vitriol and brushing them all off in favor of simply living life to the fullest.

Sing like this, you talented fuck."
