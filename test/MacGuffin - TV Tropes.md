A MacGuffin, every one of them<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

_"In crook stories it is almost always the necklace, and in spy stories it is most always the papers."_

"MacGuffin" (a.k.a. McGuffin or maguffin) is a term for an object or element in a story that drives the plot, but serves no further purpose. It won't pop up again later, it won't explain the ending, and it won't do anything except possibly distract you while you try to figure out its significance. It usually takes the form of a mysterious artifact, package, or weapon that everyone in the story is chasing, though in some cases it won't even be shown.

To determine if an object is a MacGuffin, one can ask certain questions:

-   _Is the nature of the item or the item itself interchangeable?_ If the item is of great value - and is desirable or important solely because of that value, rather than any properties of the item itself - there is little difference between a diamond, a priceless painting, or an exotic statue, as the objectives surrounding it would differ only trivially: The plans surrounding its theft would be largely the same, the mission to transport it to a specific place would be largely the same, and the investigation to locate it would be the same. When reading the story or script, replace the name of the item and ask if the story is all that different.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Is the nature of the item irrelevant to the plot?_ All MacGuffins have some extraordinary value, whether it be monetary, prestige, historical significance, supernatural power, or forgotten knowledge. These things are often, but not always, explained in detail within the story so that the audience understands the characters' desire for the item. These elements, however, are not vital to build the plot; any narrative usefulness from having the item is either nonexistent (often due to No MacGuffin, No Winner) or relegated to the coda of the story, when the plot and the desire for the item is over. In other words, if whatever function the item may have is actually relevant to the plot (such as a magic sword being used to cut something that is normally uncuttable), it is not a true MacGuffin (contrast MockGuffin, for when an object that isn't really a MacGuffin is mistaken for one).

If it passes both of these criteria, then congratulations - it's a MacGuffin!

A common MacGuffin story setup can be summarized as "Quickly! We must find X before _they_ do!". While a MacGuffin is technically a kind of Plot Device, that term actually encompases much more, referring to anything that motivates a character to get from point A to point B and beyond (an important distinction to make): This could be as simple as an invitation to the party; the invitation gets the plot going but is not the goal of the characters. Compare Magnetic Plot Device, which is an explanation of why the characters are getting into repeated adventures.

The term "MacGuffin" was popularized by Alfred Hitchcock, who credited one of his screenwriters, Angus McPhail, with the creation of this concept and the name for it, citing a particular school-boy joke:

A man is riding on a train when a second gentleman gets on and sits down across from him. The first man notices the second is holding an oddly shaped package.

"What is that?" the first man asks.

"A MacGuffin, a tool used to hunt lions in the Scottish highlands."

"But there are no lions in the Scottish highlands," says the first man.

"Well then," says the other, "That's no MacGuffin".

Hitchcock and McPhail were not the first to formulate this concept: Silent-film actress Pearl White starred in cliffhanger serials (most famously in the film _The Perils of Pauline_) in which the characters spent most of their screen time chasing each other for possession of a roll of film, or some other doodad. This device occurred so often in White's serial films that she routinely referred to the coveted object as a "weenie", using the term precisely as Hitchcock would later use "MacGuffin".

In academic circles, MacGuffins are sometimes called the Golden Fleece, after the artifact from the myth of Jason and the Argonauts. The Fleece was first mentioned by the Greek poet Simonides, which makes this trope Older Than Feudalism.

If you want to start arguing that your favourite series' most awesome magical thing isn't a MacGuffin, remember that Tropes Are Tools. Having a MacGuffin is not necessarily bad writing, depending on how it's handled — concretely defining or giving a central role to the object of a chase can _detract_ from a work, if the point is to focus on the characters.

MacGuffin sub-tropes:

-   Accidentally Broke the MacGuffin: When someone breaks the MacGuffin when they needed it.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Artifact of Attraction: If the object itself is inherently irresistible.
-   Artifact of Doom: If the object itself is inherent but at the same time can prove to be pure evil. Which can result in insanity, death, or worse.
-   Artifact of Hope: An object that would be ideal for slaying an otherwise unslayable evil. Odds are that unslayable evil will want it too just to make sure the hero can't use it against them.
-   Clingy MacGuffin: Inversion of this trope — its most important attribute is that the person who has it wants to be rid of it.
-   Demanding Their Head: A bounty is placed on a character with specific orders to cut off their head and return with it.

-   Hostage for MacGuffin: The heroes have the MacGuffin. The Villain has a hostage and wants the MacGuffin. Trade ya?
-   Hostage MacGuffin: The hostage _is_ the MacGuffin, the thing the heroes are searching for.
-   I'm Dying, Please Take My MacGuffin: A character has the MacGuffin. (S)he dies after giving the MacGuffin to another character (usually the heroes) and asking them to take care of it.

As you might have guessed from the sheer number of sub-tropes, this is a very common trope in fiction. So common, in fact, that it has its own page on The Other Wiki.

**Do not confuse with Plot Device. Please, don't.** Also not to be confused with the tribe from _Brave_, or anyone of Scottish descent. Also not to be confused with a breakfast sandwich served in McDonald's restaurants.

-   The _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_ Story Arc _Great War in the Bizarre World_ features the Luminous Ray, which is needed by the goats to lift the mind-control placed on the bees but is also being sought after by the wolves.

    Fan Works 

-   _Bring Me to Life_ has a couple of examples:
    -   The Keystone, a crystal which the First needs for its plan to access the Eye of Creation and destroy reality.
    -   Hope's Dagger, a weapon forged at the dawn of time, which is the only thing capable of harming the First.
-   "Browncoats at World's End" turns Jack Sparrow's compass (_Pirates of the Caribbean_) into one for the crew of _Serenity_; after they find themselves trapped in the past and separated from their ship, their only clue is that they must find Jack Sparrow in order to find their ship, eventually guessing that the compass must be held by the right person to truly find _Serenity_ (for example, Mal cannot use it as he is torn between the ship and his love for Inara).
-   _The Captain of the Virtual Console_ has the Runestones, manifestations of players' love for gaming.
-   In _Daphne Greengrass and the Boy Who Lived_, the Order of the Phoenix all acknowledge that the prophecy about Harry and Voldemort is basically this. Even without knowing the exact content of the prophecy, they all agree that it wouldn't be that useful to Voldemort even if he acquired it, but by encouraging their enemy to focus on retrieving the prophecy they ensure that the Death Eaters aren't going to do something more dangerous.
-   _The New Adventures of Invader Zim_ has the Meekrob crystal containing the codes that lead to Project Domination, which all three teams are after (Zim and Tak and their respective allies to conquer Earth with it, Dib and his friends to stop either of them from doing so).
-   In _The Night Unfurls_, the Pantielle ancestral sword serves this purpose in the _Ansur Arc_. Its only purpose is to give Kyril a secondary reason to go to Ansur — to find it and return it to its rightful owner. His primary objective is to ascertain the situation in this place, to see whoever important is in cahoots with the Black Dogs (and root them out if necessary). Kyril even says that the sword is merely for ceremonial purposes, not something practical to fight with.
-   In _Pokéumans_ the Gemstone Files take this role at first, but are later replaced by the Dimensional Gems.
-   In "Doctor Who in the Multiverse of Madness", when the Thirteenth Doctor visits the Marvel Cinematic Universe, learning of the Infinity Stones prompts her to compare them to the segments of the Key to Time, as each were six powerful artefacts that could come together to give the wielder great power.
-   In _The Prayer Warriors_, during "The Battle With the Witches", the heroes look for five keys to get into Dumbledore's office in Hogwarts. One is carried by Ginny, another by Ron, a third by Harry, and a fourth by Hermione. It's unclear who has the fifth key, since after the fourth key, the Prayer Warriors break into Dumbledore's office and kill him.

    Fairy Tales 

-   In _Catherine and Her Fate_, the skein of silk that Catherine's Fate gives her is so apparently worthless that she nearly throws it out. It has, it turns out, two properties: it is exactly the color needed to sew the king's wedding garments, inspiring him to say that she shall have its weight in gold, and it outweighs his entire treasury, thereby inspiring him to demand her story.

    Gamebooks 

-   The titular Stone from _Zaltec II: The Generation Stone_ serves as this.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   World Tag Team Championships were a Macguffin in the heyday of the National Wrestling Alliance. While the NWA forbid its member promotions from crowning their own World Heavyweight Champion, they were free to create "World" champions in other weight classes and divisions. Thus, most NWA promotions had a World Tag Team Championship that was just a glorified regional title never defended outside of the territory. It also made the promotion look better to fans, who thought they were being treated to World Championship caliber matches even when the World Heavyweight Champion wasn't in town. Of course, most local fans had no idea that other World Tag Team Championships existed; unless they read the Apter wrestling magazines. In which case, it was often confusing seeing these titles listed as "NWA World Tag Team Championship (Memphis version)" or "NWA World Tag Team Championship (Mid-Atlantic version), etc."

    Tabletop Games 

-   The _Paranoia_ adventure "The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues". The title Black Box. What it does is eventually revealed, in some versions of the adventure, but it's unlikely your player characters will live long enough to discover it.
    -   The _High Programmers_ variation also recommends throwing in some "Cow Creamers", side goals for the Ultraviolets to fight over so they can trade them to a NPC.
-   The "Honor & Intrigue" system has a character attribute actually called "MacGuffin". Taking it turns one of the items in your character's possession into a future MacGuffin.
-   Referenced in _Mistborn Adventure Game_, where the book uses the term "Macguffin" to describe a Secret that has no function other than to be the thing everyone wants. For example, a vast hoard of precious metal that may or may not exist, and which is of little use anyway, because the world is coming to an end and there's nothing to buy with that wealth.
-   In _Warhammer 40,000_, a Standard Template Construct fragment makes for an all-purpose MacGuffin. STCs were machines from the Dark Age of Technology containing the sum total of human technological knowledge, plus the capability to build any device. No working STCs exist anywhere in the 41st Millennium, but a printout from the STC's library can be worth entire solar systems, so the Imperium will use every means at their disposal to grab one.
-   Most of the _Dungeons & Dragons_ campaign _Dragon Heist_ is a chase after the Stone of Golorr, a sentient but basically useless artifact. There is a coda where the Stone points the way to a dragon hoard, at which point the dragon reveals itself to be the Big Good and makes the "final battle" a doddle, but the real story is already over by then.

    Theatre 

-   In _Iphigenia in Tauris_, the MacGuffin is an image of Artemis, which if stolen would bring liberation to Orestes from his mental toils, as was promised by Apollo.
-   In _Philoctetes_, while much is made of Philoctetes' special bow (received from Herakles himself) the plot itself is not really concerned with its purpose as much as the choices the characters make because of and in spite of its importance.
-   In _Sherlock Holmes_, the MacGuffin is a packet containing letters, photographs, jewelry etc. that were sent to Alice Faulkner's late sister by a foreign gentleman who seduced and ruined her, and the villains want it out of the picture now that he wants to marry. The name of the gentleman is merely whispered inaudibly, and the sister's name is not revealed either.
-   In Agatha Christie's _Spider's Web_, the root of the trouble is something hidden in the house by the previous owner, which unscrupulous people are trying to get hold of. Until the denouement, neither the audience nor the characters (with one exception) even know what it is, only that it's said to be worth thousands of pounds.

    Theme Parks 

-   At Universal Studios:
    -   As in the first movie, the all-powerful AllSpark shard is this in _Transformers: The Ride_.
    -   In _Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast_, Jimmy's advanced Mark IV rocket ship is sought after by the Yolkians, who believe that it can be used to enslave the earth if duplicated.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Queen of Thieves_: In "Becoming the Gilded Poppy", Jett's story of how he joined the Poppy involves him stealing some item. Beyond it being valuable enough to steal, the nature of the item is so unimportant that no one even remembers what it was; visually, it's depicted as a pixelated blur.
    
    I grab the—whatever it was—and slip it into my jacket.
    
-   Mary's eye in _Shikkoku no Sharnoth_. We know what the eye does for _her_ but exactly how it would really help anyone else who acquired it is vague. They simply want it.

    Web Original 

-   Deconstructed with the discs on the _Dream SMP_, especially in Season 2. Materially speaking, they're worthless, and indistinguishable from any other copy of Cat or Mellohi on the server. However, Tommy ascribes a lot of sentimental value to them, and both Tommy and Dream give them more and more symbolic value as the struggle between them progresses, becoming representations of the power Dream has over Tommy and L'Manburg. Over the course of the Vengeance Arc, Tommy starts to believe that getting the discs back will remove the power Dream has over him and thereby end all conflict (which is wrong, but not an unreasonable conclusion to come to), and with Techno egging him on, goes to greater and greater lengths to get them back. His Heel Realization at the Green Festival happens when he realizes he'd been wrong to put the discs over his friends and country, and while he doesn't stop chasing them, he keeps his priorities in check from that point onward. However, Dream has no such realization and continues to treat them as all-important to the point of putting them on literal pedestals, and sabotages himself at multiple points to get them, and his taunting Tommy with the discs is what ultimately leads to his downfall. Tommy and Dream both experience the consequences of giving the discs ultimate importance, but while Tommy uses those consequences to learn and grow into a better and wiser person, Dream refuses to confront any realistic flaws, and that's why Tommy wins.
-   The Project Orwell software in series 1 of _KateModern_, which is mysteriously absent from the second series.
-   _The Ningyo_: Christopher Marlowe's piece of the map leading to The Ningyo.
-   The Nostalgia Chick has a jar of mayonnaise that has been transformed into one by Lord MacGuffin.
-   The Tower of Pimps, a stack of four gold blocks on an obsidian block pedestal, in _Rooster Teeth_'s, "Let's Play _Minecraft_". Nothing fancy, just bragging rights material for whoever wins the challenge of the episode.
-   The dimensional transponder in _The Cartoon Man_ which turns out to be a pen the characters found earlier. In the third movie, the Glove of the Animator becomes one as well.
-   This trope was featured in Episode 2 of the TV Tropes podcast _On the Tropes_.
-   The Rise of the Budget remake of Troopers has the Orb. Lampshaded, of course.
    
    **Dread Lord**: I kinda feel like the Orb is this vaguely defined MacGuffin.
    
-   The campaign in _LARPs_ features a magical artifact called the Eleventh Eye.
-   Dave Sindelar of _Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings_ coined the term "Gizmo MacGuffin", to refer to a MacGuffin that is a type of advanced science fiction technology that is not used, but only fought over. An example from many serials of the 30s and 40s is a death ray that the good guys and the bad guys fight over.
-   The Imperial Hereditary Seal in _Farce of the Three Kingdoms._ Sun Ce openly refers to it as a Plot Device, and everyone treats it as though it is important, although it really doesn't bestow anything. Later the narrator steals it from Cao Cao's effects in order to use it to legitimize Liu Bei.
-   _Overly Sarcastic Productions_ has a video discussing the subject, citing the Infinity Stones as a textbook example, having great power but only being used to power up the villain at most (the Time Stone is the exception, since it's used as a Chekhov's Gun), while the One Ring is a subversion, since its inherently corruptive nature is intrinsic to the story, and could not be replaced with any shiny jewelry.
-   In _Potion Seller_, a knight is trying to purchase the strongest potions before heading into battle, and the potion seller refuses to serve the knight on the grounds that the potions are too strong for the knight to handle. The video is entirely about the knight and the potion seller arguing about the potions, and the actual nature of the potions themselves is never really elaborated on.
-   The grand prize for competition-based Object Shows rarely if ever gets mentioned but it remains the driving force for why the contestants want to compete in the first place. The prize can be anything under the sun no matter how ridiculous, oddly specific or unwanted it turns out to be as listed below:
    -   A dream island for _Battle for Dream Island_ and _Battle for Dream Island Again_ and a "BFDI" and "BFB" for _Battle for BFDI_ which all double as a MacGuffin Title.
    -   A million dollars - _Inanimate Insanity_ (The one which popularise as the standard prize), _Inanimate Insanity Invitational_, _Battle On Murder Island_, _Battle Show Cool Yeah_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , The first season of _Excellent Entities_ , _Fight in Flight_, _Jeopardized Objects_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , _Object Connects_, _Object Cringe_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , _Object Madness_, _Object Oppose_, _Object Overload_, _Paper Puppets_ and _The Strive for the Million_
    -   A billion dollars - _The Big Competition_, _Object Invasion_ and _Object Twoniverse_
    -   Other amounts of money such as one hundred million dollars (_Battle of the Breeds_), a trillion dollars (_Battle For A Trillion Dollars_), one bajillion dollars (_Extraordinarily Excellent Entities_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ), five million dollars (_Object Havoc_), ten million dollars (_Object Oblivion_ and _Object Lockout_), _three_ dollars (_Show Host Object Show_) and a hundred-thousand dollars (_Object Universe_ and _Town Attack_)
    -   A manor - _Object Cringe Again_, _Object Lockdown_, _Object Show_ (Plus a million dollars) and _Race to the Mansion of Tomorrow_
    -   A wish for anything - _Animated Inanimate Battle_, _Battle For A Wish_, _Challenge to Win_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , _Object Towel_ (Plus a towel), _ONE_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , _Victory Will Be Mine_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and _Wishful Thinking_
    -   _The Almost Valentinesly Object Show_ has one of becoming the host's girlfriend/boyfriend/partner since he specifically made the competition to find one and he's not picky.
    -   _Battle for Circle_ had a circle despite everyone being identical anthropomorphic circles themselves.
    -   _Battle for the Right to Beat Derp to Death_ is self-explanatory.
    -   _Burger Brawl_ offered a Burger King gift card for life even though all the contestants don't like the fast food there but still wanted it for bragging rights.
    -   _The Daily Object Show_ has several with The Really Good/Bad/Neutral/Chaotic Smelling Lotions (Seasons 1, 3, 6 and 7 respectively), a hyper-realistic one-dollar bill (Season 4), a "dream island" (Season 8) and a Jack In The Crack coupon and McDonalds gift card (Consolation Prize for seasons 1 and 7).
    -   A toy guitar from _The Wiggles_ for _Greeny's Grand Game_
    -   _Nice Show For Weenies_'s enticing prize of a billion-dollar cheque and an unlimited credit card instantly convinced the contestants to stay in the competition despite being forcefully kidnapped.
    -   _The Struggle for the World_ probably has the biggest prize in which the winner becomes the president of the entire planet of Earth.
