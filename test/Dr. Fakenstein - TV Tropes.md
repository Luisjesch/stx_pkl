Being the Trope Codifier for the extremely popular Mad Scientist trope, it's not a wonder that _Frankenstein_'s titular doctor<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  would have his own share of Expies, but there are some that go as far as ripping off his name too. Apparently, it's a popular practice for writers to name Mad Scientist characters after the most famous one in fiction (either as an Homage or Parody, or to drive the point home that those characters are supposed to be **MAD!**).

Most of the time, it's an exotic-sounding surname starting with "Franken" or ending with "Stein" (as in Albert Einstein, another popular codifier of this trope). "Victor", despite being a fairly common name, may also count as this trope if the character in question is known for dabbling in dangerous, questionable science involving giving life to dead/inanimate beings (even more so if said character has a German-sounding surname or is German himself) as the reference to Victor Frankenstein becomes obvious in that case.

Sometimes a member of The Von Trope Family. Very often accompanied by The Igor, another heavily parodied character. Compare with Frankenstein's Monster, for the kind of experiment this character is probably into, and Franken-X, for when the name "Frankenstein" is used to refer to the creature Frankenstein created instead of Frankenstein himself.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Franken Fran_ has Fran Madaraki, a cute Frankenstein's Monster. While she was most likely (erroneously) named after the monster, she still fits the trope on virtue of being an expert surgeon that creates horrors of her own.
-   _Soul Eater_ has Dr. Franken Stein, another deliberate Expy and a typical Mad Scientist, albeit a heroic one.
-   A more subtle example would be Franky from _One Piece_. After surviving a gruesome accident, he had to rebuild most of his body with mechanical parts from a ship, becoming a cyborg in the process (thus, following the theme of rebirth present in the _Frankenstein_ novel).
-   Dr. Franken von Vogler, from the _Giant Robo_ OVA, is actually a subversion. He was introduced as a classic Mad Scientist at first, but turned out to be just a victim of bad PR.
-   _Blood Lad_ has a Dr. Franken who creates Akim Papladon, a demon that steals body parts of his liking.

    Comic Books 

-   _Runaways_: Chase Stein's parents, Victor and Janet Stein, are a pair of Mad Scientists whose inventions are used by their son. The father's name should tell you everything.
-   In _Madman_, the titular character's civilian identity is Frank Einstein. Supposedly, Doctors Flem and Boiffard named him for Frank Sinatra and Albert Einstein, but Frank _is_ a resurrected dead man with a scarred face and bolts in the sides of his neck...
-   In a _Rantanplan_ comic, the titular dog and Averell Dalton are kidnapped by two scientists named Frank and Stein (the latter also having Einstein Hair).
-   Professor Martin Stein is the man responsible for the reactor that created _Firestorm_. As such, he is often perceived this way (the 2004 run of the comic gives him Einstein Hair for good measure).
-   An Elseworlds _Superman_ one-shot story called _Superman Monster_ had a version of Lex Luthor called Viktor Luthor. He finds some Krypton techology from the rocket that brought Kal-El to Earth and uses it to help him give life to a reconstructed human being.
-   The main villain of the _Madballs_ comic book published by now defunct Marvel Comics subsidiary Star Comics was a Mad Scientist named Dr. Viktor Frankenbeans.
-   A recurring character in _Count Duckula_ comics was Dr Frankenstork.
-   A Pig-Iron solo story in _Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!_ pitted him against the similarly-built Frankenswine's Monster, created by Dr Victor Frankenswine.

    Films — Animation 

-   Tim Burton's _Frankenweenie_, a remake of the 1984 short film of the same name, is both a parody and homage to the 1931 film _Frankenstein_. Frankenweenie is about a young filmmaker and scientist named Victor Frankenstein (natch) who brings his dog back to life.
-   Dr. Finkelstein from _The Nightmare Before Christmas_, Halloweentown's resident scientist and creator of Frankenstein's Monster\-inspired Sally.
-   In _Scooby-Doo! Frankencreepy_, Velma's original family name is revealed to be "von Dinkenstein" (it was changed to just "Dinkley" during immigration). Turns out she is also the descendant of a Mad Scientist and even ends up becoming one herself, although through hypnosis.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ has Dr. Frank-N-Furter, the infamous crossdressing Mad Scientist played by Tim Curry.
-   _The House by the Cemetery_ has this as part of a twofer homage: the Mad Scientist villain is Dr. Freudstein. (This is a less certain example, though, as it is pronounced _\-steen_).
-   Jeffrey Franken from _Frankenhooker_ is a "bio-electro technician" (whatever that means). He tries to revive his dead wife by reconstructing her body with pieces from dead hookers.
-   Played with in _Young Frankenstein_: the name is spelled the same, but Fredrick insists the pronunciation is "FRONK-in-Steen"... at least until he jumps off the slippery slope and fully embraces his family legacy, at which point he _demands_ to be called by the usual pronunciation.
-   Blaxploitation film _Blackenstein_ has yet another Dr. Stein who creates the eponymous monster.

    Literature 

-   _Franny K. Stein_ is about Franny, a seven year-old practitioner of mad science.
-   _Rowley Jefferson's Awesome Friendly Spooky Stories_: In story 11, _The Science Project_, Victor ends up becoming a Dr. Frankenstein parody, but is actually expanded upon because he does more than create Frankenstein. Of course, Frankenstein is still his most famous creation, but Victor did some cool stuff.
-   In _Thief of Time_, Jeremy Clockson says to The Igor that he's heard some people really come alive in thunderstorms, and Igor says yes, that used to happen when he worked for Dr. Finklestein...
-   Considering its title, it's no surprise that _Vic and Frank: Necromancers_ loves this trope.

Interestingly enough, Dr. Frightenstein also doubles as a spoof of the Classical Movie Vampire... complete with full _Dracula_ regalia (except for sneakers) and speech full of Vampire Vords. He prefers toast instead of blood.
-   In _Beetleborgs_, Dr. Baron von Frankenbeans appears occasionally to check in on his creation (named simply "Frankenbeans").
-   _El Chapulín Colorado_ had an episode where the main antagonist is called Dr. Panchostein. The characters even called him "same as Frankenstein, but in Totonaca version".
