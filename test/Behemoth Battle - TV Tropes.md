**Hermes:** We're jerked! Nothing can stop a monster that big!  
**Prof. Farnsworth:** Nothing except an even more equally big monster!

What's better than having a huge monster? Having two huge monsters! Then making them fight each other!

A staple of monster- and kaiju-focused movies (but in no way limited to that medium), where two giant creatures square off in a no-holds-barred fight, just because they can. Makes for great visuals and even more collateral damage. As a highly visual trope, only examples shown on-scene should be added.

The word _creature_ should be interpreted quite liberally here. It matters more how it looks than how it functions. Giant humanoid robots and other Humongous Mecha are explicitly included. For battles between giant machines and biological creatures see Mech vs. Beast.

In no small degree builds on Rule of Cool and Cool Versus Awesome. See also Monster Mash. Primate Versus Reptile is an especially common variant, thanks to the iconic fight scene in _King Kong (1933)_. Following _Jurassic Park III_ (2001), the Spinosaurus Versus T. rex pairing also gained some popularity.

Any film set in a Lost World or Hollywood Prehistory setting will likely have such a scene.

Examples are generally sorted chronologically.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   The Super Robot Genre, starting with _Mazinger Z_, is based on this with giant Humongous Mecha battling giant creatures or robots (depending on the work).
    -   The movie "_UFO Robo Grendizer, Getter Robo G, Great Mazinger: Kessen! Daikaijuu_" has these mecha (from different shows) allies to battle a giant prehistoric monster (more bigger than them) surviving unknowingly in the depths of the oceans.
-   _Attack on Titan_: The Titans don't normally fight each other and go exclusively after humans, but starting on the "Battle Of Trost District" Arc, the Rogue Titan was introduced and it exclusively attacks other Titans because said Titan is Eren Yeager himself, having come into his power as a Titan Shifter. Naturally, this leads to Titan duels and _brawls_ as more Shifters are revealed that can completely wreck cities as if they're made of Styrofoam.
-   _The Big O_: the eponymous Humongous Mecha battles other robots (called Megadeus) and a few giant monsters over the course of the series.
-   _A Certain Scientific Railgun_: One such battle occurs at the end of the Dream Ranker Arc between Mikoto Misaka manipulating a giant skyscraper-sized iron-sand puppet against the Doppelganger of Ryoko Kuriba having created a similarly-sized puppet made of city debris.
-   The _Darkstalkers_ series is usually about human-sized monsters fighting each other, but the _Night Warriors_ OVA adaptation decides to kick things up a notch in the final battle against the Big Bad, where a giant-sized Huitzil robot appears specifically to fight Pyron. Normally the same size as the rest of the cast, Pyron in turn grows to the same size to do battle.
-   In _Digimon Adventure: (2020)_, there are plenty of large Digimon running around and multiple fights that could be said to be this, like Mugendramon vs. DoneDevimon, but special mention has to go to Episode 50's clash: Goddramon and Holydramon vs. Milleniumon. When Milleniumon is put on the back foot by the two holy dragons teaming up on him, he evolves into the absolutely _colossal_ ZeedMilleniumon, who makes the aforementioned Goddramon and Holydramon (who themselves make average Kaiju-sized Digimon like WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon look like ants in comparison) absolutely microscopic.
-   _Fairy Tail_
    -   Several of these happen, usually whenever dragons are involved. Makarov's Titan form versus Acnologia at the end of the Sirius Island Arc, Atlas Flame versus Motherglare while Natsu and Future Rogue fight on their backs at the climax of the Grand Magic Games, and Igneel versus Acnologia near the end of the Tataros Arc.
    -   Exaggerated in _Fairy Tail: 100 Years Quest_ during the battle between Wood Dragon God Aldoron and Gajeel supersized by Brandish's Command T magic. Most dragons are about the size of large buildings. Aldoron's _height_ alone is about that of a large mountain (and adding in his length would be more comparable to a small _mountain range_), while his opponent has to be super-sized via magic to a comparable size explicitly compared to a mountain.
-   In the final installment of the anime Godzilla trilogy, _Godzilla: The Planet Eater_ there is one between Godzilla and his arch-enemy Ghidorah.
-   While most dragon fights in _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_ involve one or both parties in human form, Tohru and Elma's falling out in the backstory had them both fighting in full dragon form, with the battle reducing an entire city to rubble and the final clash resulting in a Pillar of Light so large that it was visible from space.
-   _Naruto_ has Bee/Gyuuki and Naruto/Kurama battling 5 other tailed beasts. The resulting brawl is so intense and fast-paced that it even leaves Guy comparing it to Destroy All Monsters. And this is _before_ they pull out their Tailed-Beast Bombs.
    -   Others include Gaara's attack on the Village, which was combated by Naruto and Gamabunta (with a combined transformation into the Kyuubi), Hashirama's Wood Style summons against Madara's Kyuubi+Susanoo, Kurama vs the Oostutsuki statue in _The Last_, and ultimately, Naruto/Kurama's battle against Momoshiki in _Boruto_, joined in with Sasuke'a Sunano'o.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: The eponymous EVA mechs are used by NERV to fight angels, which resemble weird giant aliens with no uniform appearance. the only thing that qualifies them as "angel" is that they have a "blood pattern blue", and halos.
-   _One Piece_: On Little Garden Island, there are two giants who have battled against each other for about a century. They've forgotten the cause for their battle, and now they just do it for fun.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_: Several battles between legendary Pokémon: Groudon vs. Kyogre, Dialga vs. Palkia, etc. Then there are a few interesting ones involving giant versions of normal-sized Pokémon.
-   The final episode of _Taboo-Tattoo_ involved Touko and Izzy having fused together fighting Arya, who had fused with her sisters.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ starts off as a typical battle between Humongous Mecha who over the series escalates into galaxy sized ones.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Several battles between Egyptian God Cards, between the God Cards and the Great Leviathan, and between Zorc and Exodia, the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon, and Horakhty.

    Arts 

-   _Carta Marina_:
    -   While Ziphius, a "terrible sea monster" (actually a swordfish), is swallowing a whole seal, it is itself attacked by an unnamed monster which is sinking its teeth into Ziphius' side.
    -   South of the island of Tile, a whale (balena) is being attacked by an orca.

    Comic Books 

-   One issue of the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ Season Eight comics features a fight between Giant Dawn and Mecha-Dawn, while a delighted Xander watches.
-   Near the climax of Earth X, a cohort of Celestials have invaded New York City. Reed Richards and Black Bolt work together to summon the one being who can fight them. The Celestials may be the size of buildings, but Galactus is the size of _the horizon._
-   In _The Goon_, the title character is temporarily transformed into a giant gorilla so he can fight El Hombre Lagarto.
-   _Kaijumax_ is an odd example: the series is about a prison for giant monsters, and it's told on their scale. They may not _look_ giant to the reader, but they definitely are.
-   The climactic battle in _Lanfeust de Troy_ is fought between giant energy clones of Lanfeust and Thanos over Eckmül.
-   Marvel's _Shogun Warriors_ series is built around this trope. The titular trio of Humongous Mecha fight a range of equally huge Kaiju, robots and Magitek horrors (and some that are much, much bigger). There are a handful of scenes where the Shogun pilots end up facing smaller foes without their giant robots, but they're very much the exception to the rule.

    Documentaries 

-   _Prehistoric Planet_:
    -   The first episode features a sequence between two adult _Mosasaurus_, the planet's largest and most powerful carnivore during the end of the Late Cretaceous. The narration states such battles can be deadly, and fossils of mosasaurs have been discovered with teeth of other mosasaurs embedded in them.
    -   The second episode features two huge male _Dreadnoughtus_, each nearly fifty metric tonnes, battling for control of the females in the mating grounds. The battle is brutal, with both animals slamming into each other on their hind limbs, stabbing with their thumb claws, and raking each other with their teeth. Because they're so huge, it takes tremendous energy to fight like this, and the loser dies from exertion.
    -   The third episode features a fight between two _Quetzalcoatlus_, one of the largest flying animals to ever live, specifically instigated between a mother defending her eggs and a rival female attempting to destroy the nest to remove competition for her own offspring.
    -   The tenth episode features a battle between two male _Triceratops_ (an old one and a younger one) fighting for mating opportunities. The younger male is six tonnes, while older male is said to weigh _ten tonnes_.
    -   The tenth episode also features a fight between a _Tyrannosaurus_ (one of the largest ever land predators) and a pair of _Quetzalcoatlus_ (one of the largest ever fliers), though unlike the other examples, this combat consists mostly of posing and threat displays, and never gets physical apart from a few brief pecks from the _Quetzalcoatlus_.
-   _Sea Monsters A Prehistoric Adventure_: A 29-foot _Tylosaurus_ finds himself fighting a larger individual of the same species. The skirmish concludes with the death of the smaller tylosaur.

-   _J-WITCH Series_: The chapter "Big Trouble, Bigger Jade" features a fight between Jade (who's been grown to about fifty feet by a growth spell Gone Horribly Right) and Gargoyle (a magical stone creature of roughly the same size). With some help from Cornelia, Jade eventually wins.
-   _Super RWBY Sisters_:
    -   The final battle of Super RWBY Sisters involves Bowser getting gigantic through magic, while the Mario Bros, Peach and Team RWBY get turned gigantic through the use of several Mega Mushrooms. After which a brawl the behemoths ensues, ending with the heroes beating Bowser in the fight.
    -   The Goomba Squad fights an actual Behemoth at Bowser's Castle in RWBY: Superstar Saga plus Bowser's Minions. If it weren't for the Koopalings backing them up, they would have lost, plus becoming the Behemoth's dinner.
    -   In RWBY Partners in Time a Shroobified mutated Behemoth started to fight the heroes after eating Dark Weiss alive, but Esdeath quickly dispatched it.
    -   Two Behemoths showed up in RWBY: Bowser's Inside Story. A Fawfulized Behemoth shows up right after Esdeath frees Sephiroth from his petrified prison, much to Weiss's and the Winter Ops' dismay. And then another Behemoth shows up to help aid Heartless Bowser, where it would attack Ganondorf and Sephiroth, the former proceeding to fight it and the latter letting Ganon take care of it and only stepping in if he needed to.
-   _Jackie Chan Adventures: Olympian Journey_: During the climax of the Poseidon arc, the Six-Eared Macaque (amped by Poseidon's powers) and the real Sun Wukong (using the Armor of the Eight Immortals) both grow to massive sizes during their clash in London.
-   A quit common occurance in _The New Age of Monsters_. Kaijus that hate humans constantly clash with kaiju that want to protect humans, Jaegers or EVAs. The only fights that are _not_ this are those involving the Symphogears.

    Film — Animated 

-   The ending of _Ark_ reveals that there are actually _two_ Arks on Alcyeon, the Ark of York being hijacked by the evil vizier, Baramanda, while there's a second Golden Ark hidden underground. The film's ending have Amarinth piloting the second Ark and battling Baramanda in order to save the remaining population of Alcyeon.
-   The climactic battle from _Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV_ features gigantic statues coming to life and battling it out with demons just as enormous in the middle of a city, all of that while the protagonist and the villain fight on top of the larger combatants, jumping from one of them to another. It's about about as epic as it gets.
-   In _How to Train Your Dragon 2_, two Bewilderbeasts, gigantic ice-breathing dragons, fight each other, one protecting the Glacial Sanctuary from the other one which serves the Big Bad, Drago Bludvist.
-   _The Land Before Time_ has the battle between Littlefoot's mother (an _Apatosaurus_) and Sharptooth (a _Tyrannosaurus rex_), two of the biggest and most powerful dinosaurs in the franchise.

-   In an earlier version of _Turning Red_, Mei was going to turn into a kaiju-sized red panda equaling her mother and battle her all over Toronto.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   The Trope Maker is probably _The Lost World_ (1925), which had a fight scene between an _Allosaurus_ and a _Brontosaurus_. Stop motion effects were provided by Willis O'Brien, who also did...
-   King Kong fights giant monsters in every installment:
    -   _King Kong (1933)_: King Kong fighting a _Tyrannosaurus rex_. This might be the Trope Codifier for modern giant monster fights in movies, and seems to have invented the Primate Versus Reptile variant. He also fights a giant plesiosaur and a _Pteranodon_ in less iconic — but still pretty cool — scenes.
    -   _The Son of Kong_: Kong's son fights a "dragon" (which resembles a nothosaur) and a giant cave bear.

    -   _Godzilla Raids Again_ (1955) is against Anguirus (his first enemy, and later frequent ally).

    -   _Kong: Skull Island_ has King Kong fighting against giant reptilian monsters called "Skullcrawlers", and at one point also fights a Giant Squid.
    -   _Godzilla vs. Kong_ is self-explanatory. It has the biggest version of Kong ever seen (he was only maybe a _teen_ in _Kong: Skull Island_), dwarfing the Japanese version by a large margin. The film features two major battles with the pair, as well as Kong fighting a pair of snake-like kaiju called Warbats, a swarm of bat-like Hellhawks, and a "battle" between Mechagodzilla and a giant Skullcrawler, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, and _both_ Kong and Godzilla against Mechagodzilla in the very Final Battle.
-   Many of Ray Harryhausen's films featured monster battles:
-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_ features a scene where mountain-sized stone-giants fight each other, unaware of the adventuring party below them. The part of the book the scene is based on describes it in much less detail.
    
    **Balin:** This is no thunderstorm — it's a thunder-_battle!_
    
-   _Jurassic Park_:
    -   _Jurassic Park III_ (2001): a _Tyrannosaurus rex_ fights a _Spinosaurus_.

-   _One Million B.C._ had an infamous fight scene between a pair of slurpasaurs. Stock footage of the scene was used in a lot of B movies throughout the '50s and '60s — you can find a full list over on the slurpasaur page. If you've seen much _Mystery Science Theater 3000_, though, you've probably seen this fight scene several times.
-   _Pacific Rim_: Giant robots fight giant extra-dimensional monsters.

-   Two examples shows up in the schlocky 70s Taiwanese fantasy film, _Sea Gods And Ghosts_. The protagonist is a Dragon Prince with Voluntary Shapeshifting powers who can turn into a giant Chinese _long_ at will.
    -   Halfway through the film a vengeful warrior god turns himself to a kaiju-sized monster to battle an ancient guardian, a giant albino ape (so a King Kong with white fur, if you prefer). The warrior god appears to be winning and the Prince, after realizing his Sword Beam couln't scratch the warrior god, turns himself to his dragon form and joins the fray. He wins, vapourizing the warrior-god with his Eye Beams.
    -   The film's climax has the prince and the Big Bad, both of them turning into dragons, clashing underwater, with the Prince winning.
-   The Shaw Brothers Toku classic, _The Super Inframan_, have the battle between Inframan and the Spider-Monster climaxing with both combatants growing themselves to kaiju size and duking it out. Inframan wins by lifting the Spider-Monster and flnging him onto a power generator, the subsequent explosion which brings Spider-Monster down to regular size, at which point Inframan finished off Spider-Monster via Giant Foot of Stomping.
-   The _Snake_ trilogy, where the first is a Chinese Foreign Remake of _Anaconda_ while the sequels took on a more distinct identity of their own, adds an increasing amount of prehistoric monsters as the movies goes on. The third movie in particular have the film's bunch of adventurers trapped in a jungle full of T. rexes before finally meeting the titular snake, which turns out large enough to battle and devour half a dozen T-Rexes all at once.
-   Several non-Godzilla Toho films prove that you don't need your most famous monster in order to have some epic fights:
    -   _Frankenstein Conquers the World_ (1965) pits a giant version of Frankenstein's Monster against the subterranean saurian Baragon (who would as mentioned above later go on to fight an evil Godzilla). The alternate ending also has him against the giant octopus from _King Kong vs. Godzilla_.
    -   _War of the Gargantuas_ (1966) serves as a sequel to the above and features two Frankensteinian monsters, Sanda the brown gargantua who is a good guy who likes and protects humans and its kind-of spawn Gaira the green gargantua who is violent, savage and eats people. Naturally, they end up fighting. Gaira also briefly fights a giant octopus at the beginning.

    -   _Space Amoeba_ (1970): The climax of the movies features a battle between a giant turtle called Kamoebas and a monster crab named Ganimes when the titular alien loses control of both monsters.
    -   _Yamato Takeru_ (1994), a fantasy adventure film that nevertheless manages to make its final fight a confrontation between Physical God Tsukuyomi Scaled Up into the Yamata no Orochi and Yamato Takeru's ultimate form, the giant armored god-warrior Utsuno Ikusagami.
    -   The _Rebirth of Mothra_ trilogy (1996-1998) has Mothra Leo fight a terrifying opponent each film: the devastating Death Ghidorah, the aquatic Dagahra, and finally King Ghidorah himself.
-   Capping the list with a really _odd_ example; _War God_ has a trio of Martians invading earth with their enlarging rays, super-sizing themselves into skyscraper-sized behemoths to crush earth's cities, and humanity's faith managed to summon a savior - Guan Yu, kaiju-sized!

    Literature 

-   The _Dream Park_ novel _The Barsoom Project_ features two examples: the War-Bots simulator scenario in which two opposing diplomats face off in control of Humongous Mecha, and the finale of the Fimbulwinter Game, in which the Big Bad in the form of a Terichik battles the Inuit hunter-god Torngarsoak.
-   In the finale of _The Brothers Lionheart_, Jonathan vanquishes the dragon Katla by rolling a boulder on her that pushes her into a waterfall. Karm, the 'lindworm' that inhabits the waterfall attacks Katla, and Jonathan and Skorpan watch in awe as the two monsters fight each other to death.
-   In _Journey to the Center of the Earth_, the explorers are caught in the middle of a fight between an icthyosaur and a plesiosaur.
-   In _The Kaiju Preservation Society_, while traveling from Honda Base to Tanaka Base in the _Shobijin_ airship, the new arrivals to Kaiju Earth become unintentional witnesses to a battle between two kaijus, one of which they know and which should've been picked up on the _Shobijin_ radar due to the tracker placed on it. The airship has to rapidly gain altitude in order to avoid becoming collateral damage. Later on, the losing kaiju ends up having its biological nuclear reactor explode, which isn't that uncommon when two kaiju fight.
-   In _Prehistoria: The Raptor's Tail_: A battle breaks out between a _Deinocheirus_ and _Therizinosaurus_ with the protagonist caught in the middle. Seen from the perspective of a wolf-sized raptor trapped between them, it results in the clashing megafauna looking like enormous kaiju.
-   In _Ragnarök_, the first sequel to _Valhalla_, an internet sequence features a fight between a colossal crab with a mountain for a shell and a gargantuan arctic fox. The battle wrecks half the Nikkei site, throwing the world into economic turmoil for the rest of the book.
-   The climax of _Ready Player One_ features the main characters turning into Ultraman and MechaGodzilla to battle each other. In the movie adaptation, Ultraman is switched out for The Iron Giant.
-   The climax of _The Yellow Fog_ has the giantess witch Arachne duking it out with Tilli-Willi the clockwork sentient mecha (who is assisted by Carfax the giant eagle).
-   _Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle_ has a very brief version of this. Rosa activates her Drag-Ride's Devil Machia Mode, which transforms it into a Humongous Mecha. She grabs Iblis (which resembles a giant demon) with one arm and crushes it with brute strength, then obliterates Poseidon (which resembles a giant squid) with a simultaneous barrage from all of her cannons.
-   In _The Voyage of St. Brendan_, St. Brendan the Navigator and his crew are pursued by a giant fish that wants to swallow them. Upon their prayers, another nondescript "great monster" appears that fights the first monster and kills it. A few chapters later, under very similar circumstances, the voyagers witness a battle between a gryphon and another giant bird.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Book of Boba Fett_ has Boba Fett's rancor being used by him to take down the Scorpenek droids of the Pyke Syndicate, which are giant robots that are otherwise immune to blaster fire because of their shields.
-   In the mockumentary TV film _Dragons: A Fantasy Made Real_, there is a fight between a _Tyrannosaurus rex_ and a Prehistoric Dragon and his mother.
-   Serves as the climax of nearly every _Super Sentai_ episode starting with _Battle Fever J_ (and by extension, every _Power Rangers_ episode), where the Monster of the Week pulls a Make My Monster Grow and the heroes counter by summoning their Humongous Mecha. However, the concept for a climatic battle between giant opponents originated from Toei's _Spider-Man_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  live action series.
-   The _Ultra Series_ was built off the idea of bringing this trope to the small screen. The franchise started as a Monster of the Week mystery/horror series where the Monster was more often than not gigantic, but really took off when _Ultraman_ added a Super Hero to transform and battle said kaiju one-on-one.
    -   Occasionally, the monsters get to battle each other as well. In fact, _Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle_ features _only_ battles between the various kaiju from the franchise's history in a Mons style.
    -   _Ultraman_ and its many sequels, spinoffs, and remakes ended up spawning the _Kyodai Hero_ genre, which is focused around superheroes like Zone Fighter and Spectreman who turn giant-sized to battle kaiju.

    -   Season 2 introduces the Six Ear Macaque, another behemoth-sized simian monster (not unlike Wukong in the previous season) going on yet another rampage, until Wukong decide to enlarge himself to battle the Macaque.
-   The Toho drama series _He of the Sun_ features a crossover battle between the man-eating giant Gaira from Toho's own _War of the Gargantuas_ and Kiyla, an insect-like _Ultraman_ monster with literal Glowing Eyes of Doom.
-   _Arrowverse_
    -   The Season 3 finale of _Legends of Tomorrow_ sees the Season's Big Bad Mallus (a demon who already towers over most of the human characters) facing off against the Legends who used the six Zambezi Totems to perform a Fusion Dance into a building-sized, fully-sentient Beebo (a stuffed toy that was itself also a Mcguffin in an earlier episode).
    -   A Season 1 episode has Ray Palmer reverse the polarity of his shrinking Atom suit to become a giant in order to fight the massive Leviathan robot sent by Vandal Savage to destroy the rebels.
    -   One of the episodes of _The Flash (2014)_ Season 5 features Killer Gorilla Grodd (recurring adversary of the heroes) versus King Shark (who just performed a Heel–Face Turn).
-   _Prehistoric Planet_:
    -   In the first episode, an old male _Mosasaurus_ relaxing on a coral reef gets attacked by a younger male, and the two duke it out in a ferocious underwater battle.
    -   In the second episode, the giant sauropod _Dreadnoughtus_ gather in large numbers in a desert to compete for mates. Two males engage in a violent fight, standing on their hind legs while trying to push each other to the ground, delivering massive stabs with their thumb spikes and brutal bites with their rake-like teeth. The loser ultimately falls to the ground and is unable to get up due to its massive weight, eventually ending up dead.
    -   In the third episode, a female _Quetzalcoatlus_ gets in a fight with another female that attempts to destroy her nest.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _BattleTech_ (1984): Tactical wargame centered on giant piloted robots (or _mechs_). Had a focus on team tactics, ie groups of mechs fighting each other. Spawned the BattleTech Expanded Universe franchise.
-   In the _Greyhawk_ setting module WG7, _Castle Greyhawk_, a battle between an Apparatus of Kwalish and an iron golem piloted by an orc takes place on level 5. It's an Affectionate Parody of FASA's _BattleTech_ game (the orc is even named "Fahzah").
-   _King of Tokyo_ is all about kaiju battling each other.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Clash of Titans shows two colossal monsters prepare to fight as some humans look on.
-   _Mecha vs. Kaiju_: See if you can guess what the two main classes of Behemoth are. Occasionally you get inter-kaiju battles, who's proven largely bulletproof but is defeatable by other kaiju, which hate it passionately for no particularly clear reason.
-   _Monsterpocalypse_ has this as its main premises, with every kaiju stereotype duking it out with one another. From giant dinosaurs, apes and Super Robots, to ravenous aliens, Martian tripods and Eldritch Abominations.
-   _Pathfinder_ has a number of monsters of the kaiju type, most of them stand-ins for Toho characters, and their fluff text describes their long history of fighting each other. That said, featuring a giant monster battle in an actual campaign would be very difficult to make interesting for the players.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_ which has has several faction who have massive mechs called Titans. Tyranids possess kaiju sized bio-titans, and Necrons have a couple of bad-tempered flying pyramids, one of them serving as the cage for the furious shard of an Eldritch Abomination. Initially, these were restricted to the mass-combat \[\[Gaiden Game/Specialist Game\]\] _Epic 40,000_, but later editions added the smaller versions of these to the main game.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: This is the Kaiju archetype's central gimmick. They can be Special Summoned to the opponent's field by tributing one of their monsters, and Special Summoned to the owner's field if the opponent controls a Kaiju. The default result is two behemoths taking over whatever battle was happening before to fight each other.

-   In _Dino Rex_, you control gigantic dinosaurs fiercely battling each other as part of a man's quest to become the ruler of the ancient world.
-   In _Fallout 4_, you may come across with Behemoth, a type of gigantic Super Mutant.

The resulting clash terrorizes the inhabitants of the Lostbelt, who genuinely believe this to be a duel between gods.
-   On one memorable location on Gran Pulse in _Final Fantasy XIII_ (2009), you encounter a behemoth (a huge and nasty monster type) and a giant dog-like monster fighting each other. The two of them block the passage to your destination but are so consumed by their fight that you can sneak past them with a bit of luck. If they do spot you, it results in a Mêlée à Trois where you can play one of them against the other to make it slightly easier.
-   _Freedom Planet 2_ is not afraid to have the player fight giant robots, but there is one situation where this trope is utilized. Aaa allows the team to commandeer the BFF-2000 - a boss from a previous stage - after the rest of his robotic "buddies" were corrupted by Syntax's Code Black and hijacked by Serpentine.

-   While the _Pokémon_ series has had Legendary Pokémon duke it out from time to time, a major element of _Pokémon Sword and Shield_ is the Dynamax phenomenon which temporarily turns otherwise-normal Pokémon giant in battle. Pokémon Gyms in the Galar region are built on areas where the phenomenom can be harnessed to have giant trained Pokémon fights in front of an audience.
-   _Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue_ have a few select bosses (Loki, Darebolico, Olympius, and Queen Bansheera) who, upon their initial defeat, then turns kaiju-sized, necessitating you to summon the Train Megazord to continue the fight. In such instances however the stage shifts to a Phantom Zone so as to avoid damaging civilian structures and prevent collateral damage.

    Webcomics 

-   _Girl Genius_: The fight (2012) between Franz Scortchmaw, the Bone Gnawer of the Heterodynes, and "Pretty Boy" (no name given, despite his gentledragonly manners). Rather low on the collateral damage for a monster fight, though.

Courage, in an attempt to rescue Muriel, undergoes a similar transplant to turn himself into a similar monster. The two initially battle it out conventionally in Paris, before the fight between them devolves into a painting competition, and later, Courage feeding Eustace a ton of giant croissants.
-   _Futurama_:
    -   "Anthology of Interest I": A giant Bender is attacking the city, so Professor Farnsworth enlarges Zoidberg to fight it.
        
        **Hermes:** We're jerked! Nothing can stop a monster that big!  
        **Prof. Farnsworth:** Nothing except an even more equally big monster!
        
    -   "Benderama": Bender combines with his nanoreplicants to form one giant Bender to fight an alien giant.
-   Both _Godzilla: The Series_ and _The Godzilla Power Hour_: Godzilla versus Monster of the Week.
-   Despite the number of Mega-Mutes in _Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts_, including the titular character once she learns how to shapeshift into a Mega-Jaguar, there are very few fights between Mega-Mutes in the series, until the finale when Dr. Emilia reverse-engineers Kipo's genetic modifications to transform herself into a Mega-Walrus.

-   One of Terry Gilliam's _Monty Python_ animations was about an invasion of killer cars that were defeated by atomically-mutated giant cats. Unfortunately the cats then ate the city.
-   Lampshaded in the _Phineas and Ferb_ episode Doof Dynasty. The medieval Chinese versions of the protagonists pilot a giant terracotta warrior into battle against Doofus Kahn's mecha dragon. Monogram sees the fight and remarks: "Man they would love this in Japan."
-   In the _Pinky and the Brain_ episode "Tokyo Grows", Brain attempts to take over Tokyo by disguising Pinky as the giant monster Gollyzilla, turning him into a giant with a reversed Shrink Ray, and then turning himself giant too and saving the city by fighting Pinky. Hilarity ensues when the real Gollyzilla shows up and Brain fights him instead of Pinky.
-   _Primal (2019)_: One of the show's protagonists is a female _Tyrannosaurus rex_ named Fang, who ends up fighting another Prehistoric Monster at least Once an Episode. She fought other tyrannosaurs who ate her nestlings, a giant snake, wooly mammoths, giant bats, a Giant Spider and a monstrous ape-man. The show's other protagonist, Spear the caveman, also gets turned into a giant and fights said ape-man after it seemingly kills Fang.
-   _Steven Universe_:
    -   Gem fusions are massive, ranging from "has to duck to fit through a door" to "the size of a building". Pit the two biggest ones against each other, and you get the Behemoth Battle that is Alexandrite versus Malachite, a fight that takes up nearly an episode, only interrupted by a watermelon riot.
    -   "Change Your Mind" has two:
        -   First off, Blue and Yellow Diamond (who aren't fusions) get into a fight when their views about their long-lost younger sister Pink Diamond get the better of them (one of them has had a Heel Realization, and it takes the fight for the other to have one too).
        -   Then there's the Diamond Mecha, piloted by White Diamond versus the _enormous_ fusion Obsidian, composed of Steven, Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl. Obsidian, while much smaller than the Diamond Mecha, uses her BFS to cut off its hands and reach the head, where she screams into its eyes. The Crystal Gems are then able to climb inside to confront White after being defused.
    -   The Sequel Series _Steven Universe: Future_ has a climax where Steven's stress and repressed mental issues lead to him transforming into a Godzilla-esque monster as large as a mountain. The Crystal Gems fuse into Alexandrite trying to restrain him, but are defeated instantly. The Cluster, taking the form of a giant arm, has somewhat more success, restraining the Steven-monster for several minutes. Finally, this trope is also defied by Garnet, whom Yellow Diamond transforms into a giant: instead of fighting Steven, she gives him a Cooldown Hug that everyone else joins afterwards.
-   _The Transformers_: The combiners tower over regular Transfomers, so the few times combiners get into fights count as this. However, Season 3 introduces Metroplex (who is part of Autobot City, a fortress scaled to Transformer-size) and Trypticon, who is created in the first few episodes when the Constructicons bring an actual human city to life and grant it a Tyrannosaurus Rex-like robot mode. Trypticon is so gigantic he is able to smash the original Autobot HQ to pieces, volcano and all.
-   _The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald_: The climax of the rare sixth and final video _The Monster O'McDonaldland Loch_ has a battle occur between Simon (the titular Stock Ness Monster) and his robot double built by the video's villain Stiles.

    Real Life 

-   Most massive real world predators actually tend to avoid each other, or when there is a chance encounter prefer to use threat displays rather than simply duke it out, the obvious reason that it's too risky for both parties. Exceptions include:
    -   The battles to the death that occur when sperm whales prey on giant squid. Many whales carry the scars of these titanic fights.
    -   Occasions of predation between large carnivores and equally massive herbivores can also count in the minority of cases the predator isn't attacking a young or weakened prey item. An example of the fossil record would be conflicts between _Tyrannosaurus_ and _Triceratops_, with teeth and horn caused scars found on each other as proof of titanic battles.
    -   Even more interesting than the Sperm Whale/Giant Squid conflict would perhaps be the prehistoric encounters between _Carcharodon megalodon_ and _Livyatan melvillei_ (the former a giant shark, the latter an older version of a sperm whale with bigger teeth). There's little evidence they actually did battle with each other, but the fact that they were the two largest predators of their time and place and that they were roughly the same size would make for a very intriguing (while infrequent) scenario.
-   Surprisingly this _does_ happen from time to time with megafauna herbivores in greater degrees than with carnivores due a combination of factors ranging from higher population, having less danger of starving due to not needing to chase down their food, and Herbivores Are Friendly being very much averted in real life with most species who aren't skittish being highly aggressive.
    -   Here's one example of a hippopotamus engaging in a fight with a few white rhinos. Here's another one where a hippo confronts a cape buffalo.
    -   Male elephants during musth become highly territorial and aggressive, and often engage in battle, locking tusks and wrestling each other to submission.
    -   In the 1960s, electrical workers in Nebraska found the fossilized remains of two mammoths that had died while locked in combat. Their tusks had gotten tangled into one another, and it was likely they had fought over a mate, were unable to free themselves after getting stuck together, and ultimately died of exhaustion.
    -   Male elephant seals (the largest extant pinnipeds in the world, with some specimens in the range of 4 tons) will engage in brutal fights during the breeding season much like their namesakes. Since they lack legs, the majority of these fights consist of males body slamming and biting each other, and both will usually be Covered in Scars by the time one backs down or dies.
    -   If male sauropods fought to establish dominance for breeding rights like many modern herbivores, then clashes between members of the largest genuses like _Argentinosaurus_, _Alamosaurus_, and _Sauroposeidon_ may have been the greatest example of this trope to ever occur in the real world.
