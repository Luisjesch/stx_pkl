A Hate Sink is a character who is _intentionally_ made (by the work's creator) to be vile and unsympathetic to the audience. While your average Jerkass or Complete Monster can fill the bill, an ordinary scumbag works just fine, especially in stories where the main antagonist has no 'face' (e.g. in a film about a natural disaster) or the Big Bad's motives remain sympathetic even when their deeds are evil. This character is written to draw fire, and to provide appropriate catharsis for the audience when karma finally catches up to them.

The Hate Sink is not The Scrappy: the writers _wrote_ the Hate Sink to be hated, while the Scrappy garnered a Hatedom on his own. But it is possible for a Hate Sink to become a Scrappy if the audience hates him for reasons _other_ than what the creators intended. <sup>Example&nbsp;</sup> 

So to summarize:

1.  The Hate Sink is a character created by the author with the **express intention** of being loathed by the audience.
2.  The Scrappy is a character which was not created to be loathed, but still is.<sup>Examples&nbsp;</sup> 

Often overlaps with Complete Monster, which is a character whose vile deeds have cost them the sympathy of the audience, though even a Complete Monster can be charismatic, while a Hate Sink never can. Also compare Anti-Role Model, where the character is designed to be a bad example to the audience; Love to Hate, when the viewers actually enjoy this character _because_ of how effective they are at being hatable; The Heavy, which is about the impact for the story; Jerkass, who may be unlikable, but stays above the Moral Event Horizon; and Jerks Are Worse Than Villains, which is when fans hate the jerkass character more than the actual villain.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Contrast with Anti-Villain, when a villain has sympathetic traits; and Laughably Evil, when a villain is funny and thus entertaining (though in some cases a villain can be both sympathetic and funny).

If all of the work's other _characters_ hate this individual instead of the work's _audience_, then they are instead Hated by All, although the two tropes can and frequently do overlap — a character being Hated By All is often a good indication that the audience is supposed to hate them as well.

**Notes:** Just because a villain goes out of their way to be as mean and/or horrible as possible doesn't mean they are a Hate Sink. This is a very specific type of villain that invokes repulse and loathing, as in that sort where you won't find charisma within them at all. You'll only feel disgust for them and want them to die as quick as possible and preferably in a cathartic, horrifying and/or undignified manner. Villains like Emperor Palpantine and Voldemort lack sympathetic qualities and can be incredibly vile in their worst moments, but it doesn't mean that they're literally designed to be unlikable; whereas something like Dolores Umbridge or the MCU literation of the High Evolutionary will kick dogs left and right for petty reasons and have crimes largely grounded on Realism-Induced Horror. Of course, a Word of God would be a definitive confirmation in this case, even if the villain becomes way more popular or charismatic than expected.
