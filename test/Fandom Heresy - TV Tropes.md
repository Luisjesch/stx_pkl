Please don't list this on a work's page as a trope.  
Examples can go on the work's YMMV tab.

**Mason:** The new _Star Wars_ movies are way better than the older ones anyway.  
**Shawn:** Whoa.  
**Gus:** ...We are dealing with a crazy person.

Among Fandom there are some topics which, once mentioned, will cause endless, passionate debate over which faction of the Fandom is correct. Then there are some things which it seems like _everyone_ in the Fandom agrees on. _Of course_ Alan Moore is one of the best comics scribes out there. _Of course_ the American adaptation of _Coupling_ sucked. And _of course_ _Garfield_ has been going downhill for years. How could anyone think otherwise?

Well, inevitably there are one or two fans who do. Actually voicing these opinions which run contrary to Fandom consensus, however, can entail some risk. You might get some funny looks if you said you preferred the Japanese _GoLion_ over the American _Voltron Lion Force_. If you say you liked _Voltron Vehicle Force_, however, prepare to be treated as a Fandom pariah, along with comments that you're obviously not a _real/true_ fan. Essentially, this is the Fandom variant of The Complainer Is Always Wrong.

Sometimes, this trope can even extend to fans who hold opinions that are only tenuously related (or, in some case, _entirely unrelated_) to the work in question - which run contrary to Fandom consensus. Can exist in the form of "you can't be a true fan of Band X, if you also like Band Y or you don't also like Band Z".

By the extension of the above two paragraphs, in certain circles, the term "true fan" is the fandom equivalent of Godwin's Law. It's like declaring "I believe in \[X\] because I'm a 'regular' fan". In other words, if someone plays/invokes the "\[X\] because _I_ am a true fan" , then they automatically lose the argument.

"After a rather influential message by M Sipher in 1997 the term 'true fan' has taken on a whole new meaning among some TransFans. It's a sort of twist on Godwin's Law where anybody who accuses somebody of not being a true fan automatically loses any argument, and is often discounted as a buffoon afterwards."

**Please note, to count as Fandom Heresy it must be said by someone who _is_ part of the Fandom.** For example, someone saying "_Breaking Bad_ is stupid" or "_Discworld_ is boring" doesn't count. However, a _Breaking Bad_ fan saying, "Ozymandias is an overrated episode" or a _Discworld_ fan saying, "Sam Vimes is the lamest character in the series" would definitely count.

A very commonplace, fandom-independent example of Fandom Heresy is disliking the main character, or the Ensemble Dark Horse if the main character isn't also the most popular character. Doubly so if you say that said character is a copy of a character from another series. Being a fan of a Hate Sink (in a non-Love to Hate way) or The Scrappy is just as universal an example of heresy, for equally obvious reasons.

See also Fan Dumb for another way to hit the Berserk Button of certain fandoms. Compare with Broken Base, where the two sides of opinion are more equal rather than one overwhelming majority against a minority "heresy"; as well as Sacred Cow, in which the "heresy" includes even non fans. Not to be confused with Fandom-Enraging Misconception, which is for common factual errors about works that particularly annoy their fans.

This trope is extremely dependent on biases and sometimes it may make you feel uncomfortable if you do not hold their views. However, do not lose heart: It's all right to keep your opinions and be a 'heretic' if it's being truer to your heart and you are not directly harming anyone. You just probably need to be extra careful on how you express your opinion, but you will eventually find a community or friend where your opinion wouldn't look too much like a heresy. Don't let the biases of the loud fandom listed below prevent you from enjoying (or _not_ enjoying) the media.

___

## Examples:

-   Professional Wrestling

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   For the anime community in its entirety, mentioning 4Kids Entertainment will get you targeted by the community as a whole due to things they're done in their dubs such as bowdlerization, Dub Induced Plotline Changes, and more. With the exception of some voice actors associated with them (such as Dan Green or the original _Pokémon: The Series_ cast), it's best not to say anything positive about 4Kids no matter how nostalgic their dubs are to you.
-   _Berserk_: Do not approve of Griffith's heinous actions during and post-Eclipse, otherwise you'd be on the receiving end of Guts's Dragonslayer.
-   _Bodacious Space Pirates_: It's not a good idea to suggest pairing any female characters with males to the fandom unless you want to get blasted by the Bentemaru, and don't _even think_ about speaking negatively about Marika/Chiaki and _especially_ Jenny/Lynn, the latter notable for being revealed to be an _outright couple_.
-   _Bunny Drop_: Never mention the second half of the series where Rin falls in love with and marries her adoptive father to the fandom, given that its infamy is so great that both the anime and live-action adaptations ignore it in favor of a more familial approach.
-   _Cardcaptor Sakura_: Even if you were a relatively innocent kid that wasn't aware of the original when it came out, it's best not to mention the dub, let alone that you like it, to most fans, as many consider it to be one of the worst anime dubs ever made. This is mostly due to as while the Americanization and removal of any romantic relationships (even the heterosexual ones) in a mostly ROMANCE series wasn't bad enough, in an effort to make to show gender-neutral (read: suitable for a male audience), they cut out any episodes not focused on Syaoran to make him a co-protagonist with Sakura (possibly even make _him_ the main character over Sakura). Even simply referring to the series as _Cardcaptors_ is enough to set fans off.
-   _Cowboy Bebop_: You think the Netflix adaptation was better than the anime? You liked how Julia was revealed to be the Big Bad the entire time? Well, congratulations, because you now effectively have a bounty on your head that every oldschool anime fan will want to collect!
-   _Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School_:
    -   Overlapping with the games, do not say that you approve of the method Junko Enoshima used to turn Class 77 into the Remnants of Despair being Ryota Mitarai's brainwashing animation, as the fandom sees it as an underwhelming explanation.
    -   Similarly, do not speak positively about Kazuo Tengan being the mastermind of the Future arc.
-   _Death Note_ fans will be writing down your name in the blink of an eye should you praise any aspect (unless it's Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Ryuk, who even they'll admit did a pretty good job) of Netflix's adaptation of the series.
-   _Digimon Adventure 02_:
    -   While liking the Matt/Sora couple will make some fans upset at you, don't even dare to say that it made perfect sense and not an Ass Pull.
    -   Similarly, do not say anything positive about the series' Distant Finale.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Either trashing on it or saying it doesn't exist is recommended if you ever decide to bring up _Dragonball Evolution_ to fans of the franchise, but praising the movie or admitting it's not bad... good luck trying to summon Shenron, because there's a high chance that there'll be no trace of you left by the time they're through with you.
    -   Do **not** compare Goku to Superman, and if you don't want a SSGSS Kamehameha to your face, don't suggest Superman is stronger.
    -   Regarding Broly, as of his re-introduction in _Dragon Ball Super_, saying that you prefer pre-_Super_ Broly over his current iteration will result in one heck of an ass-kicking, as his _Super_ iteration is considered to be a much better character than he was before.
-   Please refrain from bringing up the animated adaptation of _Earwig and the Witch_ to Studio Ghibli fans. If you do... the result would almost make the curse that transforms someone into a pig from _Spirited Away_ look _sedate_.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Don't say anything even remotely positive about Shou Tucker. Otherwise, you'll be turned into a chimera yourself.
    -   Never say you were okay with Maes Hughes' death, as the character was well-liked and his death was considered very heartbreaking to the fandom.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_: Don't tell a fan that you enjoyed the Endless Eight arc of the anime, or you'll be praying to Haruhi herself for a way to stop the hate mail.
-   _Hayate the Combat Butler_: _Never_ say anything even remotely positive about Hayate's parents, as what they do at the beginning of the series was enough for them to be unanimously hated by the fandom.
-   Hentai: To hentai fans, the two biggest sins that a hentai can commit are "NTR" and "Ugly Bastard", both things despised by fans of the genre. Saying you approve of such themes will cause fans to tear you apart.
-   _Infinite Stratos_: The fandom has a rather big one: if you even _dare_ to make a _microscopical_ amount of criticism to Charlotte Dunois... Well, may God save you from the backlash you will suffer.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   Speedwagon is a beloved character in the fandom and is considered nigh untouchable when it comes to criticism. However, if you trash him and certain users know where you live, it's best to move out of the country to avoid the firestorm of poison rings, stolen steamrollers, free-moving bombs, baseball bats or Stand barrages that'll be heading.
    -   If you really want to a fan of the series, here's a handy piece of information: do _not_ skip parts. Because of the targeted harassment that many a part skipper has faced over the fandom's long history, it's really not a good idea for one to not read or watch a part of the original manga or anime adaption, because doing so will let you miss a huge chunk of the story overall. If you decide to do so... the Ultra Security House Unit awaits you.
-   _Komi Can't Communicate_: The fandom has a sacred rule; never make lewd art or the like of Komi-san (unless it's with Tadano). Otherwise, be ready to face the angry fandom.
-   _Love Hina_: Due to her treatment of Keitaro, saying that you like the main heroine, Naru Narusegawa, will result in you getting the same beating that Keitaro does from the girls.
-   _Love Live!_: To put it simply, don't insinuate that any character is anything short of a lesbian to the fandom. Just _don't_. And if you draw porn of the characters having sex with dudes, prepare to be punished even more by the fandom, and we don't mean Nozomi's "washi washi".
-   _Macross_: Bringing up the American "adaptation" _Robotech_ is bad enough (the only reason why you won't be unanimously shot down on sight is because a good portion of _Macross_ fans used to be _Robotech_ fans). Bringing up Harmony Gold, the creators of _Robotech_ who are infamous for being the reason the _Macross_ franchise suffered No Export for You until _2021_ and for suing other companies into oblivion for even the slightest cases of perceived copyright infringement of characters they didn't create yet own the distribution rights to, is enough to draw the anger of the entire fandom and _will_ get you unanimously shot down. Protoculture forbid you say anything positive about Harmony Gold, otherwise you can expect yourself to end up in a remake of the end of _The Wings of Farewell_: Being blasted apart by the combined power of an array of Wave-Motion Guns. And once the dust is settled, they'll summon the _Battletech_ and _Transformers_ fandoms as well to make sure nothing left of you remains, considering those franchise have also been sued by Harmony Gold in the past.
-   _My Dress-Up Darling_: Never say anything negative about Marin Kitagawa or ship her or Gojo with anyone but each other.
-   _My Hero Academia_:
    -   Disliking Izuku Midoriya or calling him a bad protagonist because he "cries all the time" quickly became this for fans, with many clarifying that he rarely ever cries in later arcs except for when it's deemed appropriate, such as Sir Nighteye's death. Even though he _did_ cry quite a bit in the first few arcs, him crying was quite understandable given the treatment he had to endure for (initially) being quirk-less, which can make some of the criticism lean uncomfortably close into the Men Don't Cry stereotype that ends up promoting toxic masculinity.
    -   Calling out Inko for having gained weight since Izuku's childhood. A lot of fans don't take kindly to people saying she has become ugly or unattractive due to gaining weight and put down those who say it by pointing out that it would be perfectly normal for a (technically) single mom to do such a thing. All things considered, should you be foolish enough to do this... well, it _won't_ end well, to say the least, as you'll have the misfortune of being on the receiving end of a gargantuan pummelling, courtesy of Izuku himself as he goes absolutely berserk and _brutally_ beats you up with a thousand United States of Smash with the rage of a thousand suns.
    -   Saying that you like Mineta, or at the very least saying that you think he's a good character, will get you no shortage of death glares from the fandom since he's widely seen as The Scrappy of the _entire series_, as well as one of the most notorious scrappies in manga and anime in the last few years.
    -   Do you like Overhaul? Do you think he's cool? Do you want him to be redeemed? Congratulations. You now have the entire fandom's undying hatred. Even feeling the slightest amount of sympathy for him in his current state is enough to set some fans off and get you on the receiving end of a whooping courtesy of the entire 1-A Class.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   While opinions on the War Arc is split on whether it's good or not, do not say that the Invasion of Pain Arc isn't good, else prepare to face Pain and his Six Paths.
    -   Bringing up Sequel Series _Boruto_ to the fandom is not a good idea as they don't have a high opinion of it, and doing so will basically get you on the receiving end of being pummeled by Kurama or by the crowd, in Kurama's honor. You may be able to get away with saying positive things about the _Boruto_ manga, however, as it's considered to be much better.
-   _Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind_: Never bring up the butchered edited version _Warriors of the Wind_. If you do, the fandom will leave you stranded in the Toxic Jungle where you'll be attacked by giant mutant insects. Even Hayao Miyazaki hated the recut.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   While (unlike other adaptations they've done) praising the Netflix adaptation can be considered okay, never say it's better than the manga or anime.
    -   _Never_ speak positively about Ace's death at the hands of Akainu, otherwise be prepared to meet the same fate as him.
    -   Also, **do not** speak positively of the Celestial Dragons or the fandom will ensure you die a slow and painful death.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   Anime fans tend to despise the show's use of Comic-Book Time, so saying Ash staying 10 years old is a good creative decision will cause fans to break out the torches and pitchforks and hurl them at you. The creators of the anime _themselves_ repeatedly get a ton of flak whenever they'd re-confirm his age.
    -   Mentioning or supporting the "Comatose Ash Theory" (that Ash has been in a coma the entire series) will cause the fandom to cry Berserker Tears and launch a large Electro Ball at your house.
    -   Saying that you liked _Pokémon the Series: Black & White_ or that it's your favorite part of the anime is enough to make its fandom go ballistic, as it's derided for various problems such as reverting Ash back to a novice Trainer, Iris (and sometimes Cilan) being considered The Load, how Team Plasma was handled in the anime, and more. Even just bringing up the Meteonite Arc that had to be dropped due to the Tohoku Earthquake in 2011 will cause fans to want your head on a pike over how it ended up ruining the saga as a whole.
    -   Fans do not want to be reminded of _Pokémon: Genesect and the Legend Awakened_ due to the fact that it introduced a second Mewtwo in a situation where the original would have fit in perfectly. If you want to piss them off, claim that you liked the movie or its Mewtwo. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   When it comes to villains, do not speak negatively about Pokémon Hunter J's villainous aspects, as she's considered to be one of the most serious and terrifying villains in the anime. Failure to comply with this will get you turned to stone.
    -   Say that you like Tobias and that it was fine for Ash to lose against him and not even a full team of Legendary Pokemon will save you from the fandom's wrath.
    -   Bringing up the end results of the Kalos League will cause a ton of hate from the fandom to erupt at you, given the major controversy over the outcome. For bonus points, claim that you _approved_ of Alain's victory over Ash. It’s okay if you say you like Alain, as he does have his fans. It’s also okay to bring up the other League losses, as they didn’t get nearly as much backlash as Kalos did (except maybe Sinnoh).
    -   Regarding the fallout of "Electric Soldier Porygon", do not tell fans that you're okay with Porygon being Exiled from Continuity, as fans are upset over not only Porygon getting banned from the anime but also its evolutions never being able to appear in the anime at all (especially since Porygon itself was not even the cause of the incident). You can say that the episode's banning is completely understandable, but not Porygon's banning.
    -   Do not speak positively about the 2015 DVD of the _Adventures of the Orange Islands_ season to the fandom, as they are upset at the way Viz Media butchered it. This is due to two Missing Episodes having the appearance of Jynx with her original coloring. One of them happens to be _Lorelei/Prima's spotlight episode_, meaning one of the Kanto Elite Four has been officially Exiled from Continuity <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  by TPCI solely due to Jynx, something fans are sure to be unhappy about.
    -   While fans are divided over the merits of the Pokémon movies (whether they're just vehicles for various Mythical Pokémon or have stories that would be more than welcome in the series proper), never say that any of the movies after _Genesect and the Legend Awakened_ are better than any that came before it. In addition, saying anything negative about the first Mewtwo, Lugia, Latias & Latios, Lucario, or Keldeo's roles in their respective movies will get you stuffed into the Defense Mechanium of Altomare.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_:
    -   Never, ever, _ever_, try to redeem Kyubey. While there was a certain level of wiggle room about it in the earlier days of the fandom, the events of Rebellion have pretty much ensured that he is utterly hated by the fandom at large and any attempt to see 'his point' will get you torn apart by a legion of Magical Girls who would say otherwise.
    -   Writing any of the Magical Girls as straight is not something one does in the fandom without scorn. Partially because the list of male characters who get focus and are thus likable is very small (the only male character who gets any respect from the original series is Madoka's dad for example, and spin offs like the mangas and Magia Record add very few others) and partially because of all of the Les Yay in the series, writing any Magical Girl as straight is tantamount to walking over a pit of lava on a flimsy rope in turns of safety. The only member of the original Magical Girls who could even be attempted to written as straight and not get you pillared is Mami, and that is partially because Rebellion partnered her with Nagisa and the fandom would rather have Mami be straight than attracted to a elementary student, but the fandom would rather still pair her with another Magical Girl if at all possible. Even the Magical Girls who do clearly show attraction to guys are expected by the fandom to be either Bisexual or in denial of their true sexualities in fan works, no exception.
-   _Rent-A-Girlfriend_: Do not criticize the main heroine, Chizuru, unless you want the fanbase to seek out and assault you.
-   _Revolutionary Girl Utena_:
    -   Do not suggest that Juri and Miki have any romantic chemistry whatsoever, or else the fandom will verbally brutalize you, even if all your other ships for Juri are femslash ships. In fact, ship _any_ het pairing in the series at all and you'll get this result.
    -   Don't say anything positive about the manga or Chiho Saito. If you do, the lightest punishment you'll receive is a lecture on why Saito is the devil incarnate for something she said over a decade ago and changed her mind about later on.
-   _Rosario + Vampire_: Do not ship Tsukune with anyone besides Moka Akashiya or say he should be with any of the other girls. You're still allowed to like any of the other girls, but do not deny the ship of Tsukune/Moka.
-   _Rurouni Kenshin_: Saying that you liked the _Seisouhen_ OVA will get you hacked apart for its Happy Ending Override. For the record, you'll know how despised that one is when not only most fans deny _Seisouhen_'s existence, but even Nobuhiro Watsuki himself, who didn't write it, shares the same opinion too.
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   Something you should never do is say that any of the Senshi are straight or ship them with males, including the Shitennou (despite them having female forms), as giving the Senshi male love interests in any capacity is dangerous. The only straight pairing you can get away with liking or supporting is Usagi (Sailor Moon)/Mamoru (Tuxedo Mask).
    -   Suggest that _Sailor Moon Crystal_ is any good, or that it's your favorite adaptation. Even if you acknowledge its flaws, be ready for a slew of screaming about the animation and the characters being "ruined" and accused of supporting heteronormativity and misogyny, as well as a tirade on how _Crystal_ is the cancer killing the entire franchise.
-   _School Days_: While a huge Jerkass and womanizer, defending Makoto for _any_ reason will cause the fans to summon both Kotonoha and Sekai to rape you, force you to impregnate them and kill you.
-   _Spy X Family_: Don't approve the actions of Murdoch Swan, else fans may "mistake" you for a mosquito.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: Do not tell a fan that you were okay with Nia's death at the end of the series, just one reason being it coming out of nowhere during _Simon and Nia's wedding_ of all things. Doing so will lead to you being on the receiving end of a huge whooping.

    Comic Books 

-   _Archie_:
    -   Don't say that you like the new continuities better than the original.
    -   Never bring up the film adaptation of _Josie and the Pussycats_ to the fans of the series.
    -   When it comes to ships involving Archie, don't say that you like the ship of him with Cheryl better than Betty or Veronica.
    -   Don't say that you like Ginger Lopez in her first appearances where she replaces Cheryl in those comics that Cheryl was originally in.
-   _The Boys_: Never say Homelander can beat another Superman Substitute and even worse, never say he can beat up the original himself. It's up to the point where the "Omni-Man vs. Homelander" fight in _DEATH BATTLE!_ shows just why.
-   _Captain America_: Never state that you thought the "Captain Hydra/Stevil" plot twist from _Nick Spencer's Captain America_ and the ensuing Crisis Crossover _Secret Empire_ was great. Otherwise, expect to be beaten by the entire Marvel fandom for professing your approval of one of the most ill-thought attempts to upend the status quo in comic book history, one that went against everything the character stood for. And when the fandom comes to beat you up, they can and will do it all day.
-   _DC Comics_:
    -   Do not speak positively about _Identity Crisis (2004)_, as it's considered to have started one of the worst eras in the franchise.
    -   Speaking positively about _The New 52_ will also get you in trouble, due to it being considered a terrible Continuity Reboot that was eventually undone.
-   _Fantastic Four_: It's not a good idea to mention _any_ of the film adaptations to fans, especially the 2015 movie due to its Ashcan Copy status.
-   _The Flash_: If you value your life, never say anything positive about _Heroes in Crisis_. It was so hated that DC decided to do a massive damage control for this story and make it look like it never happened in the first place.
-   _Judge Dredd_: Do not say that you liked the 1995 Sylvester Stallone film, just two of the reasons being that the titular character took off his helmet, something that is considered sacrilege by the fandom, and shoehorning the characters from the other _2000 AD_ stories such as the ABC Warriors and the Angel Family.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_:
    -   It's not a good idea to **ever** mention Ken Penders, mainly due to the fact that his lawsuit against Archie Comics over his characters and concepts not only lead to a Cosmic Retcon\-induced reboot that got rid of _any_ characters created by former writers, but also eventually led to the cancellation of the comic itself and even has had repercussions throughout _the entire franchise_ as a whole. Speaking his name _will_ lead to everyone harnessing the powers of the seven Chaos Emeralds to verbally attack you so severely that you might need a trip to the local psych ward.
    -   Interestingly, while the story was once praised by fans, nowadays, speaking positively about _Endgame_ is almost guaranteed to land you on a watchlist, mainly due to the plotline of the main character himself getting framed for Sally's supposed murder being considered by most fans as idiotic.
    -   Do not speak positively about Drago Wolf, not because he's a Hate Sink, but because he's considered to be a bad villain.
    -   In a similar vein, saying anything positive about Knuckles' father, Locke, will lead to the fandom "microwaving your baby".
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   Professing fondness for _One More Day_ will have fans take you in to be on the receiving end of a brutal beating courtesy of Peter himself, as they despise that story for undoing Peter and Mary Jane's marriage via Ret-Gone, which was Joe Quesada's main goal with the story. To a lesser extent, the story reversed years of character development for Peter Parker and Aunt May (Peter being a teacher and an Avenger and May discovering Peter is Spider-Man). Needless to say, it's so horrifically bad that it's up to the point where there's actually a Revenge Fic fan-comic that shows Peter and Mary Jane themselves going all out to retcon Joe out of existence as revenge for doing this story.
    -   In the same topic, you can debate of your favorite ship (either MJ, Felicia, Gwen or any other girl he dated before but definitely _not_ Carlie Cooper) but the consensus in the fandom is still the same: Spider-Man should be married and have kids and if he should be separated from said wife, it should be via a divorce, and saying a married or a divorced Peter can't work or he should not age is 100% sure of making the fandom angry against you. Thanks to _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_, the fandom saw the idea can work.
    -   Any kind of appreciation for _The Amazing Spider-Man (2022)_ is as dangerous as fighting Peter when he isn't making jokes, due to it starting off with a vaguely defined incident that rendered Spider-Man even more of a Hero with Bad Publicity than he usually is, followed by a blatant attempt to take Mary Jane off the table as a potential love interest, and then killing and resurrecting Kamala Khan at the drop of a hat.
    -   Don't _ever_ suggest that Miles Morales is not a _"real"_ Spider-Man unless you want to be attacked by a venom blast. He may be a Legacy Character, but Miles Morales is just as much of a Spider-Man as Peter Parker is, which is only reinforced by the comics, as well as adaptations like Insomniac's _Spider-Man_ games and the _Spider-Man: Spider-Verse_ films.
-   _Superman_:
    -   Never, _ever_ bring up Matrix, Linda Danvers, Cir-El, or Ariella Kent to fans of Supergirl and when talking about Supergirl.
    -   If you ask who would win a battle between Superman himself and a Superman Substitute, the only good answer is Superman himself, especially if you decide to make him fight Homelander. In this case, the result is always "Superman wins without being touched once". Needless to say, any dissent will lead you to be epically curbstomped by Superman himself.
-   _X-Men_: It's not wise to say anything negative about the original five members.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Comic Strips 

-   _The Addams Family_: Bringing up the straight-to-video _Addams Family Reunion_ will have you blown up by Uncle Fester.
-   _Peanuts_: Regardless of the ships involving Charlie Brown, do not deny the ship of him with the little red-haired girl.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Coco_: Don't say that you approve of Ernesto de la Cruz and his actions (except praising Benjamin Bratt's performance), otherwise you'll _wish_ the fandom never remembered you for that.
-   _Despicable Me_: Go up to any fan and say that you still like the Minions and they're the best part of the movie and even merely mentioning them. Those poor little critters got hit by this like a truck by the time the prequel got released.
-   _Disney Animated Canon_: Do not say that direct-to-video sequels are better than the original movies. With some caution, you may be able to get away with praising most of them, but saying you liked it more than the original is a huge no-no, _especially_ if the original was a Disney Renaissance film.
-   _The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Disney)_: Do not speak negatively about Frollo's status as a villain, as he's considered to be one of the best ones in all of Disney's animated canon. You can hate Frollo for his personality and actions, but not his villainous aspects. Otherwise be prepared to meet the same fate as him.
-   _Kung Fu Panda_: The fandom is very protective of the Po/Tigress ship and will use the Wuxi Finger Hold on you if you _dare_ say you don't support the pairing.
-   _The Land Before Time_: Saying anything positive about the direct-to-video sequels will have you snatched up by the Sharptooth.
-   _Lilo & Stitch_: Don't _ever_ speak ill of Lilo in any fashion unless you want to get blasted to smithereens by Stitch, as fans are incredibly protective of her. Criticizing Lilo's successors (Yuna and Ai) is fair game due to how divisive they both are, but criticizing Lilo herself is _absolutely_ off-limits.
-   _Tangled_: Don't even imply that Gothel cared for Rapunzel even a little or else be prepared to endure the Flame Wars that erupt, alongside discussions about Abusive Parents and how Gothel treated Rapunzel like an object.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Alien_:
    -   Are you considering speaking bad about _Aliens_, considered by the fandom to be the defining film in the series? If you do, fans will leave you to be brutally killed by the Xenomorph. Same applies to the first movie.
    -   Similarly, do not speak positively of _Alien³_, as fans loathe that movie for the _massive_ Happy Ending Override of the much beloved ending of _Aliens_. Do so and you'll be taken out by another Xenomorph.
-   _Back to the Future_:
    -   Criticizing the two sequels is understandable, but criticizing the original or calling it a "bad film" will either get you covered in cow manure or worse, get hanged, drawn and quartered by everyone, their parents, and their grandparents as it is considered to be the most beloved movie by many movie fans.
    -   Fans are very happy with how the series bowed out gracefully after three films, so do not suggest that it's time for a _Back to the Future Part IV_, or worse, a remake of the original.
-   _Batman Film Series_:
    -   Criticizing the first movie is a sure way for fans to leave you to be beaten by the Caped Crusader himself as it is the most defining movie of all time. _Batman Returns_ can be criticized to an extent, and many are divided on whether or not it's better than its predecessor, but you must still concede that it's better than the next two films.
    -   Do not say anything positive about _Batman & Robin_ or be prepared for another beating from the Caped Crusader himself.
    -   Do not say that Michael Keaton is a bad Batman and don't say that George Clooney is a good Batman. Opinions vary on Val Kilmer's portrayal of Batman, but general consensus is that he was worse than Keaton, but better than Clooney.
-   _The Dark Knight Trilogy_: Criticizing _The Dark Knight_ in any way is a good way to either get run over by the Tumbler or more likely, get _yet another_ beating from the Caped Crusader himself. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is especially off-limits to any criticism (though it is okay to say you like Mark Hamill or Jack Nicholson better.) Christian Bale's portrayal of Batman has been criticized somewhat, but he's still considered one of the best actors to play Batman, with only Keaton and Kevin Conroy being okay to prefer over Bale.
-   _Citizen Kane_: The quickest way a critic or film school teacher can kill their street cred is to trash this film. This is ironic since the film itself was an Acclaimed Flop in its day, and it only became Vindicated by History in the 50s and 70s, so if Kane has that reputation, it took a while to get there and did undergo "the test of time".
-   _"Crocodile" Dundee_: While the two sequels can be criticized, criticizing the first movie will get you stabbed by none other than Dundee himself.
-   _DC Extended Universe_: Despite the good qualities, even if you want to be beaten to death by fans of the cinematic universe just like how Superman and Doomsday did with each other, speaking positively of _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ is, dare we say it, **not welcome**, as even fans of its early output question numerous bizarre decisions such as the casual killing off of Dick Grayson and Jimmy Olsen, the shoehorning in of other Justice League members, Batman frequently violating his Thou Shall Not Kill rule, the characterization of Lex Luthor as a capering loon, the titular fight ending over both of their mothers being named Martha, adapting _The Death of Superman_ only two films in, overall being too grim for its own good, and causing massive shake-ups that eventually resulted in numerous Aborted Arcs and the entire franchise being Cut Short. If you do decide to commit to that... well, good luck having fun out there.
-   _Die Hard_:
    -   Speaking negatively about the first movie will have fans knocking you off the top floor of the skyscraper, as it is considered a classic.
    -   Do not say anything positive about the fifth movie or be expected to do the same outcome as above. Even Bruce Willis disowned this entry.
-   _Disney_: Given their notorious reputation, it's a bad idea to speak positively of any of the _Disney Live-Action Remakes_ of their animated films and an even worse idea to say that any of them (although _Cinderella (2015)_ and _The Jungle Book (2016)_ are frequently given free passes) were better than the originals.
-   _Gamera_:
    -   Breathe a single word of criticism about _Gamera 3: Awakening of Irys_ and the fans will force-feed you to a swarm of Gyaos.
    -   Criticizing the rest of the Heisei Era is also unwise, but likelier to be tolerated.
-   _Ghostbusters_
    -   The first film is considered a classic to many moviegoers, so criticizing it will cause the fandom to have the Stay Puft Man crush you under his foot. The sequel can be criticized, but you must still concede that it's better than the 2016 reboot.
    -   Do not speak positively about the 2016 reboot to fans of the series, as they view it with absolute disdain. Otherwise expect the exact same outcome from above to happen on you.
-   _The Godfather_: Do not say that Part III is better than the previous two movies.
-   _Godzilla_:
    -   Criticizing the original film. No matter what your opinion of all the other films are, you're asking for an ass-kicking courtesy of Godzilla himself if you insult the original on any form. The _only_ possible criticism you could get away with is the voice-acting and editing changes in the English dub, and even that's pushing it.
    -   Speaking positively about the 1998 film will lead to the same result as the above example. Even simply calling the titular character "Godzilla" will lead to this, as the fandom instead refers to him as "Zilla" and states that he is NOT Godzilla, a sentiment even shared by Toho themselves.
    -   To a lesser extent, insult Mothra (especially regarding her tendency to be underutilized or Stuffed in the Fridge) and her fans _will_ come after you, as even professional film critics have found out.
-   _Halloween_: Do not speak positively about _Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers_, which was so negatively received that the next film ignores it and the two that came before it. Otherwise, you'll be killed by Michael Myers himself.
-   _Highlander_: While the sequels can be criticized, saying anything bad about the first movie will have fans leaving you to have your head sliced off by none other than MacLeod himself.
-   _Indiana Jones_:
    -   Saying that Indy's involvement in _Raiders of the Lost Ark_'s plot was irrelevant and that the outcome would've been the same even if he did nothing will cause the fandom to melt your face.
    -   Never bring up Indy nuking the fridge in _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_ to fans of the series due to its controversial nature, unless you want the same result as the above example to happen.
-   _Jurassic Park_: Regardless of your opinion of any of the sequels, criticizing the first _Jurassic Park_ or saying negative things about it will get you snatched up by a random dinosaur, preferably Rexy, as the original movie is hailed as a true classic that continues to be just as relevant and breathtaking even decades after it came out.
-   _The Lord of the Rings_:
    -   While criticizing the movies for individual aspects (i.e. Gimli's Adaptational Comic Relief, Denethor's Adaptational Villainy, etc) is okay, don't dare to say that they are bad movies, bad adaptations, or worse, that they "aged poorly", because not even having the One Ring will allow you to escape from the fans' wrath.
    -   You may say that _The Hobbit_ movies or worse, _The Rings of Power_ series are better than the LOTR movies at your own peril.
    -   May the Valar have mercy on your soul if you say you prefer the theatrical cuts over the extended versions.
-   _The Matrix_: The original film is held in very high regard by not just the fandom, but also movie fans in general, with the film considered to be one of the greatest and most influential of all time. Trashing the film will lead to the fandom forcibly unplugging you.
-   _The Natural_: While at the time it was released you could get away with it, nowadays saying that you liked the original novel's bleaker ending will lead to you getting sent flying into the field lights, as the film's ending is considered by many, both film and baseball fans, to be one of the most spectacular home runs depicted in fiction.
-   _Planet of the Apes_: Don't tell fans that you actually liked the Tim Burton movie. It will NOT end well, because the movie is almost universally hated.
-   _Predator_:
    -   The first movie is considered to be the most greatest film of all time. Saying anything bad about it will have fans leaving you to be killed by an invisible Predator.
    -   The other three entries are considered Contested Sequels and can be criticized to the extent, but don't say any one of them are better than the first movie. Do so and you'll be taken out by a Predator once again.
-   _RoboCop_: You can criticize the two sequels and its remake all you want, but criticizing the first movie, seen by critics and moviegoers as one of the absolute best action/R-rated movies of its own decade, will get you shot by none other than RoboCop himself. It'll be far, _FAR_ worse when he shoots you in the crotch.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_: Unless you are joking, _never_ say you preferred Sonic's original design to the one that got used in the film. If you do, get ready to watch one of the most divided fanbases in history come together to ensure you end up stranded on the mushroom planet.
-   _Space Jam_: Regardless of opinion toward the original, say something not negative about _Space Jam: A New Legacy_ and you might as well have signed your death warrant.
-   _Spider-Man Trilogy_:
    -   Do not speak negatively about _Spider-Man 2_, considered to be the best of the three films in the trilogy, or else expect a visit from Doc Ock.
    -   Never say that you like the Andrew Garfield duology better than the Tobey Maguire trilogy.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   Do not decide to criticize _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_, considered to be the best out of all the _Star Trek_ films, in any way. If you do, at best, the fandom will leave you marooned for all eternity in the center of a dead planet.
    -   One sure-fire way to lose whatever role you have on the Enterprise, get ganged upped on by the fandom and forcibly ejected out of the starship is blurting out that you liked _Star Trek: Nemesis_ or that it was not as bad as a lot of people made it out to be, as this movie is **highly controversial** among the Star Trek faithful due to numerous key reasons such as the blatant copying of Wrath of Khan's plot, its main antagonist, the assassination of what made any of the characters so compelling, it serving as a awful finale to The Next Generation era, and the downright offensive handing of the very idea of a Mind Rape. Not helping matters is that the director of the film never watched _Star Trek_ before and didn't care about contradicting any of the characters.
    -   Saying that any of the J. J. Abrams films are better than most that came before them will get you sent to the brig. However, you can get away with saying that they're better than a couple of prior ones despised by the fandom (such as the aforementioned _Nemesis_, for instance).
-   _Star Wars_: It should be noted that the Star Wars Fandom has a MASSIVE Broken Base, so pretty much _any_ statement about the various films or TV series, whether positive or negative, will tick off at least part of the group. These are some of the biggest examples:
    -   You can criticize the Prequel Trilogy, and you can criticize the Sequel Trilogy, but criticizing the Original Trilogy? What happens afterward will be enough to make Order 66 look like a worthy act of vengeance. You can get away with criticizing certain things about _Return of the Jedi_, such as Leia being forced into being Jabba's sex slave and wearing a metal bikini, the Ewoks and the reveal that Luke and Leia are siblings even though they'd kissed a few times before, but you must still say that it's a good film overall and better than all _Star Wars_ media that came after it.
    -   Don't say anything positive about Jar Jar Binks. In the words of Jar Jar Binks, if you do...yousa dead.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   In many parts of the fandom, speaking negatively about Order 66, considered to be one of the best (albeit sad and tragic) scenes in the whole franchise, is, in no small part, ‘’unwelcome’’. If anything, doing this will get you shot down by the Clone Troopers.
    -   Do not say anything even remotely critical about the following _Star Wars_ characters or you will be fed to a Sarlacc: Darth Vader <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  (and don't even suggest that he didn't deserve his redemption.), Luke Skywalker<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Princesss Leia Organa, Han Solo<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, R2-D2, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Boba Fett<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  (This also applies to his "father" Jango to a lesser extent), Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Darth Maul and Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus.
    -   Saying that the Sequel Trilogy is better than the Prequel Trilogy can get part of the fandom to have Clone Troopers and Separatist Droids shoot you down, but say the Sequel Trilogy is better than the Original Trilogy, and you'll be targeted by the Death Star.
        -   On the other end of the spectrum, meanwhile, saying the Prequels are better than the Sequels will get you fed to a Rathtar, but saying that they’re better than the Originals would get you frozen in carbonite never to be thawed out.
    -   Don't say that you like the edits in the Special Edition version of the Original Trilogy better than the original version, except for fixing the Special Effects Failure and using the image of Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine in _The Empire Strikes Back_. Otherwise be prepared to be hunted down by the Jedi Order.
    -   Do not speak positively about the _Star Wars Holiday Special_, considered to be _the_ worst entry in the entire franchise. The fandom would sooner admit to liking Jar Jar Binks, and that's saying something, not to mention George Lucas himself said that if he could, he would destroy every last trace of the holiday special.
-   _Terminator_:
    -   Speaking ill of _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_, considered to be THE best entry in the series and a Sacred Cow altogether, will cause the fandom to send a T-800 to target you for the most brutal type of termination. If you do survive this deathly takedown and buckle down on the claims by spreading unwanted criticism to the first movie, which, despite not being as masterful as the second one, is loved by many a movie consumer, more and more Terminator models will descend onto the battlefield... and the end result will be _disastrous_.
    -   The above results will be even more brutal and get even more Terminators in on the action whenever you say that any of the movies after _Judgment Day_ are good or that any of them are your favorite, which will end up with you on the receiving end of the worst fate anyone can get. This is due to the later entries being derided for reasons such as undoing the second movie's ending or causing many a Fan-Disliked Explanation. There are even fans that prefer the unused ending to _Terminator 2_ (which shows John Connor as adult and Judgment Day never happened) since it would've prevented any lackluster sequels from happening.

    Literature 

-   _American Girls Collection_:
    -   Don't say anything negative about the original three characters — Samantha, Kirsten, and Molly.
    -   Don't say that you like the BeForever reboot line over the original.
-   _Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation: Mo Dao Zu Shi_:
    -   Preferring the Live-Action or _Donghua_ over the novel is fine for the most part, but don't say anything positive about the changes in the live-action (like the Yin Iron plot) or the censorship itself as it is a surefire way to piss off fans.
    -   While many fans are cool if one is uncomfortable in the novel's explicit scenes, especially the Incense Burner extras, they will bring their wrath down if one accuses the novel of romanticizing sexual assault. People have written down so many large essays explaining how the book tackles the topic of consent and how both have a Conveniently Common Kink.
    -   Related to the example above, there will also be similar reactions if one will argue about how Live-Action Wangxian are "soulmates" and so pure, healthy, and consensual compared to their novel counterparts. In fact, preaching that _The Untamed_ is a perfect example of how to properly portray a gay couple will have fans harshly pointing out the irony of the draconian Chinese Censorship not allowing any kind of intimacy in the drama, changing the romance to be a bromance with heavy subtext at best. They'll also mock you for preferring a censored gay romance over a version where they're literally Happily Married.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   While liking the movies is fine, do not say that they are better than the books. Otherwise, the _Avada Kedavra_ spell is all that will await you.
    -   Don't praise the film versions of _Goblet of Fire_ and _Half-Blood Prince_ as good adaptations of their source material. It is okay to say that you liked some specific scenes or moments in those films, but you must still regard them as failures overall.
    -   As much criticism as fans have for the mainline _Potter_ films, you should still avoid ranking the _Fantastic Beasts_ films above them. You have some leeway with the first one, which has its defenders, but any ranking of the eleven _Wizarding World_ films absolutely must bottom out with _Crimes of Grindelwald_ and _Secrets of Dumbledore_.
    -   Don't say that _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_ is canon. Fans would sooner accept _My Immortal_ as canon, and that's saying something.
    -   For all of its bickering, the fandom agrees on only one thing: Dolores Umbridge is to be utterly despised at all times. In fact, she is so hated that Draco in Leather Pants is never used for her.
-   _The Hunger Games_: While liking the film series is fine, don't say that you like them better than the books.
-   _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_: Praising the film adaptations is a surefire way to get the fandom to want to burn you at the stake, as they are widely despised by not just the fanbase but the author of the books as well (to the point that he even wrote a letter on his blog for kids to show their teachers if they try to show the movie in class). Heck, even mentioning the films is enough to set some fans off.
-   _Re:Zero_: Rem is a character that's held in very high regard by the fandom. Because of this, saying anything negative about her can earn you the fandom's ire. Same thing goes for approving Subaru choosing Emilia over Rem.
-   _Sword Art Online_:
    -   Saying you like the Fairy Dance arc; perhaps the one thing the fandom and hatedom agree on is that it is the worst arc in the entire series, due to applying Chickification to Asuna, a gross Big Brother Attraction plot with Suguha, and extremely gratuitous fanservice moments, including one infamous moment mentioned below:
        -   Mentioning the scene where Sugou Nobuyuki tries to rape Asuna in any way will incite the rage of the fanbase. But only if you do so while implying that fans enjoyed the scene, as even they despise that moment and sincerely wish it never happened.
        -   Do not say anything good about Sugou Nobuyuki to the fanbase, mainly due to the spoiler-tagged event above. Just don't.
    -   Also for that matter, do _not_ in any way compare SAO to _Berserk_ else face the wrath of both sides.
-   _Warrior Cats_: It is absolutely wise to NOT admit you ship Thistleclaw and Spottedleaf/Spottedpaw, defend Thistleclaw’s actions or claim Spottedpaw was in the wrong for breaking up with him or else fans will completely sink their claws into you.

    Live-Action TV 

-   While liking any host of _106 & Park_ after AJ and Free (or perhaps Big Tigger and Julissa) is no problem, saying they are better hosts than AJ and Free could be a way to get you kicked out the intersection of East 106th Street and Park Avenue.
-   _Adam-12_: Do not say that Kristin Harmon was a better Jean Reed than Mikki Jameson.
-   _ALF_: Do not speak positively about the TV movie. In fact, don't even say it's canon.
-   _Arrow_: Do not say that you like Felicity Smoak to fans of the series or approve of her and Oliver Queen becoming an Official Couple, as she's considered to be the most controversial character in the whole _Arrowverse_.
-   _Batman (1966)_: Do not say that Lee Meriwether or Eartha Kitt was a better Catwoman than Julie Newmar.
-   _Bewitched_:
    -   Do not say that Dick Sargent was a better Darrin than Dick York or that Sandra Gould was a better Gladys Kravitz than Alice Pearce.
    -   Do not say anything positive about the movie or fans will cast a cursed spell on you.
-   _The Big Comfy Couch_: Do not say that Ramona Gilmour-Darling was a better Loonette than Alyson Court.
-   _Breaking Bad_:
    -   Do _not_ say that "Ozymandias", one of the highest-rated episodes as well as one of the most acclaimed doesn't deserve to be so in the "Breaking Bad" fandom, if you don't want to go to Belize.
    -   Similarly, don't imply that Jesse deserved his suffering during the final episodes.
    -   _Better Call Saul_: Unless you want to get shot by Lalo, do not imply Howard Hamlin deserved his fate.
-   _Buffyverse_:
    -   Don't ship Buffy/Riley, even if you respect the attempt at writing a healthy relationship.
    -   Don't say that you approved of Tara's death, mainly due to her being a lesbian.
-   _Charlie's Angels_: Don't **ever** say anything positive about the 2011 version.
-   _Crocodile Hunter_: You must **never** say anything bad about Steve Irwin, or else you'll face death by crocodile (or possibly stingray).
-   _Dexter_: Do not say that Season 4 (Trinity Killer arc) isn't the best season.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Saying anything positive about Joffrey Baratheon, Ramsay Bolton or Walder Frey is _strongly_ discouraged, unless you want to get caught in the crossfire of the Red Wedding.
    -   Don't say that the writing in Season 8 was good and undeserving of the backlash it got, or else be ready to be torched by Drogon.
    -   Similarly, do _not_ say that the actors didn't give their A-performances in the said seasons, as many of them were lauded for their He Really Can Act performances. Do so and you'll torched again by Drogon, just as if the first one wasn't enough.
-   _Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies_: If you're a fan of the show, you ship Lydia and Cynthia, and you absolutely do not headcanon Cynthia to be anything other than a lesbian. Also, 'Merely Players' is above reproach within the fandom.
-   _How I Met Your Mother_: Never say that the original ending infamous for its twist and undoing Ted, Barney and Robin's Character Development is better than the alternative ending.
-   _The Joy of Painting_: If you value your life, you will only say good things about Bob Ross.
-   _LazyTown_:
    -   Don't ever say anything negative about Stefan Karl Stefansson or say that the "We Are Number One" meme is unfunny, overrated, or dead after Stefan's passing in 2018, since said meme was used for Stefan's GoFundMe for a cancer treatment.
    -   Don't say that Chloe Lang was a better Stephanie than Julianna Rose Mauriello.
-   Pro tip: Do _NOT_, in any manner insult Mister Rogers, unless you want to die at the hands of an entire neighborhood comprised of millions.
-   _Mr. Robot_: Unless you want to be executed by the Dark Army, do NOT ever call out Angela's bullying and betrayal of Elliot in Season 3.
-   _The Mod Squad_: Do not say anything positive about the movie or fans will arrest you.
-   _The Munsters_: Do not say that Pat Priest was a better Marilyn than Beverly Owen.
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_: The Joel/Mike sides are set, and it's notorious fuel for a war, especially in the pre-Tropes days (aka the mid-1990s). It doesn't help that Joel Hodgson and Michael J. Nelson have been known to ignite these flames time and again.
-   _Once Upon a Time_: Don't tell a fan of the show that Emma was right to try to take Henry away from Regina near the end of Season 1. They will quickly pounce on you for doing so.
-   It's not really a wise idea to say to _Power Rangers_ fans that the original _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ sucks, as its iconic status will most likely result in them blasting you with the Megazord.
-   _Roseanne_: Do not say that Sarah Chalke was a better Becky than Lecy Goranson.
-   _Saturday Night Live_:
    -   Saying you liked or trying to even defend the Jean Doumanian run (1980-1981) would be a very big mistake, as it was the season that nearly killed the show and it has since been considered Canon Discontinuity.
    -   Whilst liking Colin Quinn's time as the Weekend Update anchor would be fine, saying you liked him better than Norm Macdonald will make the fandom extremely angry at you, especially now after Macdonald's passing in 2021.
-   Go ahead and say anything positive about the New Class in front of the _Saved by the Bell_ fans. Be prepared for fans of the original series chasing you at Bayside High School to no end.
-   _Scarlet Heart_: Go up to a fan and say you think _Moon Lovers_ is better than the original series. Go on. Try it. Even fans of the remake almost universally agree the original is better.
-   _Sesame Street_:
    -   Saying that you unironically like Elmo will have older fans strongly teach you a lesson on how you should leave certain things in the past rather than stick with them. And yes, it won't be pretty.
    -   Don't even THINK about making even an _ounce_ of criticism regarding the episode dealing with Mr. Hooper's death<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , considered to be one of the best episodes of the entire series, as doing so would also be seen as disrespectful.
-   _Star Trek_
    -   _Star Trek: The Original Series_:
        -   Speaking negatively about the episode "City on the Edge of Forever", in contention for being the best episode in the entire franchise, will cause you to suffer the same fate Edith Keeler did.
        -   It is highly illogical to speak positively of the notorious episode "Spock's Brain", arguably considered to be the worst episode in the whole franchise, unless you want angry fans to remove your brain.
    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_:
        -   Never profess any fondness for Wesley Crusher to the fandom, especially as he's notable for being the former Trope Namer for Creator's Pet.
        -   Criticizing "The Best of Both Worlds" two-parter, the other episode in contention for being the best episode in the entire franchise, will get you assimilated by the Borg.
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_: Speaking positively about the infamous "Threshold" episode is a good way to make the fandom throw you in the brig, given the bizarreness of the episode.
    -   _Star Trek: Enterprise_: The final episode of the series is Terra Prime and mentioning an episode that does not exist will not make you friends.
    -   _Star Trek: Picard_: Believing that the first and/or second seasons were better than the third will get you tied up and tossed at the Borg.
    -   _Star Trek: Strange New Worlds_: Don't attack the Musical Episode or fans will think you are a killjoy.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   _Andor_: Do not say that Andor isn't one of the best Disney Star Wars shows (along with _The Clone Wars_ and _The Mandalorian_) else you'd have the Empire hunting you.
    -   Saying something the tiniest bit negative about _The Mandalorian_ (The first two seasons at least. Season three wasn't as well-received as the previous seasons.) is enough for Din Djarin himself to hunt you down. Even many Original Trilogy purists consider it the best piece of _Star Wars_ media outside the original trilogy. The Child/Grogu is especially off-limits to criticism.
-   _Stranger Things_: Do not say anything ill about Eddie or his death, otherwise you'd be hearing some very familiar clock chimes.
-   _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody_: Don't say anything positive about Millicent<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  or fans will channel their inner Maddie Fitzpatrick and shove confectionaries down your throat.
-   _That '70s Show_: Saying anything positive about Randy from the final season will have fans channel their inner Red Forman and put their foot in your ass.
-   _Top of the Pops_: Due to the infamous reveal of his true nature, **never** mention Jimmy Savile to fans of the show, as they would rather not associate it with someone that is considered the most monstrous sexual predator in UK history.
-   _Two and a Half Men_: While opinions on the Walden seasons vary, don't say that you like the Walden seasons better than the Charlie seasons. And never, _ever_, say that you like the series finale. Even fans who like the Walden era will tear you a new one for that.
-   _The Wild Wild West_: Go up to a fan of the series and say you thought the movie was fantastic. Just make sure to put your affairs in order first.

    Music 

-   Never say that you like Justin Bieber unless you're really a fan of him.
-   Don't say that you like _Kidz Bop_ unless you're under 10.
-   Michael Jackson:
    -   Many fans of the King of Pop do **not** take kindly to those bringing up the child molestation accusations levied against him (especially since said accusations were reportedly proven to lack evidence), so don't accuse him of such to them.
    -   Mocking his lighter skin tone (which was at least partially caused by the skin condition vitiligo) or his cosmetic surgeries (since the exact number of procedures he had done is widely disputed, and Michael reportedly suffered from Body Dysmorphic Disorder) are considered to be in poor taste after his passing, especially if you say he was "trying to be white", as Jackson was very much proud of being black.
    -   As far as his music goes, don't say anything negative about _Thriller_ or to a lesser extent _Bad_. Otherwise you'll get hit by, you'll get struck by, a smooth criminal, so beat it.
-   _The Wiggles_: Most fans won't care if you like Sam, just don't say he's a better yellow Wiggle than Greg. And whatever you do, never, _ever_ bring up Emma, Lachey, and Simon.
-   Vocaloid:
    -   Hatsune Miku is a character held in very high regard by the fandom, so speaking negatively about her is not a wise move unless you want to be beaten to a pulp by a leek. You might get away with criticizing her high exposure due to Hype Backlash or her NT version, which has become divisive amongst the fanbase, but criticizing Miku herself is a no go.
    -   In regards to producers, do _not_ ever criticize the late Wowaka or Samfree, as both are considered to be legends amongst Vocaloid producers, especially after their unfortunate passings. Doing so is a quick way to invoke a entire fandom chasing you out of town.
-   Don't list pre-_Cowboys From Hell_ albums as part of Pantera, unless you truly want to be fucked, as even the band considers it as a 'heresy'.
    -   Only good things are allowed to be said about Dimebag. You disagree, prepare to be fucked far beyond driven.
-   Several within Metallica:
    -   The first four albums, and to a lesser extent, The Black Album, are a Sacred Cow, so fans will have you ride the lightning if you criticise them.
    -   Don't say you like St. Anger (or God forbid Lulu) if you wish the fans won't make you broken, beaten and scarred.
    -   **Never** put any other bassist above Cliff Burton. Otherwise, the fans would summon Cthulhu up your ass.
-   Never say Black Metal isn't Satanic to the more serious fans, unless you want to end up like Euronymous and your house be the target of arson.
-   Korn: Do not make any jokes regarding "Daddy", do not make any nightcore/daycore versions, and it's advised you only make a cover if you have similar experiences.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Battletech_: As with the _Macross_ fandom, do not bring up Harmony Gold in a positive light, considering them suing FASA over a perceived case of copyright infringement led to good portion of the early mecha designs being Exiled from Continuity as "The Unseen" for decades. If you do, you can expect to have the whole _Battletech_ fandom gunning for your head - if the _Macross_ fandom hasn't already blasted you apart to smithereens by that point.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy_:
    -   Don't ever say you liked the lore of _Warhammer: The End Times_, an Audience-Alienating Ending wherein The Bad Guy Wins meant to Torch the Franchise and Run, unless you want the Ordertide to come crashing down your door. In particular, trying to defend Mannfred von Carstein for what he did at the end (being the Spanner in the Works who screwed over the Forces of Order's last ditch attempt to save the world and continuing to have Joker Immunity in the setting that followed) will result in an even longer beating.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Like the aforementioned Mannfred, speaking positively about Erebus (the architect of the Horus Heresy who also continues to have Joker Immunity) will get you convicted of heresy in the eyes of the fandom, especially from Imperium fans.
    -   Mentioning Matt Ward is like mentioning Ken Penders to Archie Sonic fans. The man is a Promoted Fanboy reviled by the rest of the fandom for many reasons, most infamously for his Creator's Pet treatment of both the Ultramarines and Grey Knights as Purity Sues and his Creator's Pest treatment of the Sisters of Battle. In particular, do not _ever_ bring up the "Khornate Knights" incident - wherein the seemingly incorruptible Grey Knights slaughtered a bunch of Sisters to make amulets out of their blood and a story so lore breaking that it was immediately declared Canon Discontinuity - to any fans of franchise, let alone those of the Sisters, unless you want to be burned at the stake for heresy. He is also infamous for writing High-Tier Scrappy Game-Breaker codexes that ruined the meta. In short, unless you're talking about his portrayal of the Necrons (which has been accepted by the fandom to some extent), speaking his name at all let alone in a positive light is enough to have you marked for Exterminatus.
    -   Saying that you like _Warhammer+_ is enough to make you a complete pariah among the fandom, in particular earning the permanent ire of content creators and fan animators. In order to push for its success, Games Workshop not only "hired" a bunch of major fan animators (most infamously _Astartes_) only to lock their projects behind the paywall of its streaming service, but most unforgivably began to impose a Fan-Work Ban that forbade the creation of _any_ unofficial fan works - animations in particular - at all regardless of if their creators were making profit off them or not, which led to several notable fan works such as _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_ and Dong Gool Troll's 40k Lore Comic being Screwed by the Lawyers as a result. If you do say you like and use this service, you _will_ be marked for an immediate Exterminatus.

    Technology 

-   Do not say you like the Model A of BBC Micro unless if you want the Beeb's fans to force you to like the Model B. The Model A was seen as a crippled piece of hardware stripped of its expandability by the Beeb's fans.
-   Please, for goodness' sake, don't say you like the Amiga CD 32, CDTV or God forbid Amiga 600 or 300, if you want the Amiga fans not to burn you.
-   Although saying you like Windows Vista, 8.1 or 10 would still have half of the fandom defend you, having a positive opinion on Windows 8 (or worse, Windows ME) can cause Windows' fans to BSOD you.
    -   Likewise, having a low opinion on Windows XP is also a fast track to having the fandom attack you, as the version in question is treated as a Sacred Cow.
-   Within the Commodore 64 fandom, don't say you prefer the 8580 revision over the original 6581 SID chip or say the former is a 'corrected' version. The SID fans and musicians regard the 6581's flaws as 'features', so saying 8580 is better would be interpreted as insulting and the fans would force you to forevermore listen to 6581 sounds.
-   Within the Linux community, don't say you use Ubuntu. Their opinion on the distro is It's Popular, Now It Sucks!.

    Theme Parks 

-   Disney Theme Parks:
    -   Don't ever suggest that you prefer the second or third incarnations of _Journey into Imagination_ over the first incarnation and don't _ever_ say that you prefer Dr. Nigel Channing over The Dreamfinder. Both are easy ways to inspire Disney fans to imagine creative ways of destroying you.
    -   Unless you want to get baked into a cake by fans, don't say you like the infamous cake overhaul Cinderella Castle had gotten for Walt Disney World's 25th anniversary. Likewise, don't ever suggest you like the Sorcerer Mickey arm placed on Epcot's Spaceship Earth from 1999-to-2007 or the Sorcerer Mickey hat at Hollywood Studios that served as the park's icon from 2001-to-2015, just don't.
    -   Although _Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: BREAKOUT!_ at California Adventure is not regarded as being a bad attraction in of itself, don't say you prefer it to _The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror_ unless you want to die in a plummeting elevator.
    -   Saying that you prefer _Space Mountain Mission 2_ or _Hyperspace Mountain_ over the original _Space Mountain: From the Earth to the Moon_ is an easy way for Disneyland Paris fans to shoot you from a cannon to the moon.
    -   Saying anything positive about _Superstar Limo_ is not a wise move unless you want to get run over by a limo driven by Disney fans and miss your movie premiere in the process, as the ride is widely considered to be the worst dark ride Disney has produced.
    -   Given it is regarded as the Magnum Opus of the Disney theme parks, don't talk negatively about Tokyo DisneySea unless you want Disney fans to throw you into Mount Prometheus.
    -   Unless you want to be shot with a blunderbuss by the Swedish Chef, regardless of how dated it might be, don't _ever_ talk negatively about _Muppet\*Vision 3D_, as the show is regarded to be a Sacred Cow by both Disney Park fans and Muppet fans alike due to it being the last Muppet project directed by the late Jim Henson prior to his tragic passing in 1990. And don’t you dare say that you approved of it being removed from _California Adventure_ in favor of a _Frozen_ sing along.
-   Universal Studios: While fans generally don't care if you like _The Simpsons Ride_, trying to suggest that it's superior to _Back to the Future: The Ride_ is a very easy way for fans to want to hold you for treason. Especially _Back to the Future_ fans.

    Toys 

-   _American Girl_: No one liked the BeForever revamp. _No one._ It was the worst thing ever second only to Mattel buying the company.
-   _amiibo_: Don’t even THINK about taking an amiibo out of the box, as collectors of them despise such a practice.
-   _Lalaloopsy_: Fans will sew your eyes with buttons if you say that the reboot Netflix line is better than the original.
-   _Monster High_: Saying that you like G2 will get fans in a tizzy.
-   _Transformers_:
    -   Criticizing G1 will have fans send an Autobot to destroy you, as G1 is considered a Sacred Cow. That being said, overly idolizing G1 and bashing everything else just for not being "GEEWUN" is considered to be just as big of a red flag.
    -   For a comics-related example, saying you liked the IDW portrayal of Star Saber as a psychopathic religious zealot is a fandom sin so severe that even Primus would never forgive you for.
    -   Saying that you like the third-party figures can sometimes leave the fandom unhappy. Third-party upgrade kits are fine, though.

    Video Games — General 

-   For the video game community as a whole, _**never**_ say you approve of microtransactions in games. To a lesser extent, this can also apply to paid Downloadable Content (especially on-disc DLC), although free DLC can be considered acceptable.
-   When it comes to movies based on video games, do not say that the movies are better than the games they're based on.
-   When it comes to fighting games, saying that the Happ joysticks are better than Sanwa or Seimitsu will have fans comboing you to death.

    Video Games — Specific Titles 

-   ''Baldur's Gate": There are various topics that are quite risky to mention. Namely:
    -   Be careful if you criticize either the first _Baldur's Gate_ in comparison to _Baldur's Gate II_, particularly if your point of view is influenced by more modern games such as Dragon Age and Baldur's Gate III, or vice versa if you criticize the sequel in comparison to the first game, particularly if your point of view is influenced by classic Gold Box games and old pen & paper rpgs. The flamewar is lurking and in both sides there are certain opinions that are generally not well received, particularly because they are perceived by the majority as taking the games out of their contexts.
    -   Never ever link as a reference the (un)famous blogger Lilura, who got banned by most communities associated to this game for the very harsh and uncompromising bashing of the sequel compared to the first game, and her unorthodox general opinion about the evolution of c-rpgs.
    -   _Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear_ in relation to the Gamergate controversy and similar issues can ignite hot flamewars with a minority of vocal complainers who claim that there is a lgbt agenda in action. Sometimes even discussions whether it is a worthy addition to the saga can lead to a clash between different opinions, but these are more general.
    -   Never say to _Baldur's Gate III_ fans that you think it is not a true part of the series. Conversely, never say to fans of the original saga that the new installement makes it look outdated and flawed.
    -   If you don't want to make virtual enemies, avoid throwing trash on Imoen.
-   _Banjo-Kazooie_:
    -   To put it in a way Gruntilda would say it: "Criticizing the sequels is okay, but the original, that is nay. Say anything bad about the first _Banjo-Kazooie_, and the fandom will make your credibility go kablooey!"
    -   As Gruntilda would put it: "Say that _Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts_ is better than the first two, then be prepared for what the angry fandom is going to do to you."
    -   "If you say you liked the Cloud Cuckooland Canary Mary race, be prepared for the backlash from the fandom that you'll face."
-   _Battlefield_: Out of the dozen or so "mainline" games in the franchise, saying that _Battlefield Hardline_, the original Battlefield Vietnam or _Battlefield 2042_ is the best game in the series will get you ridiculed.
-   _Castlevania_: Do NOT criticize _Super Castlevania IV_ due to its Sacred Cow status. Otherwise, you'll be CRUCIFIED.
-   _Command & Conquer_: Saying that _Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight_ - a game viewed by the fandom as _the_ Franchise Killer and one so reviled many fans pretend it never happened - is your favorite or is canon will have you subjected to the combined force of an Ion Cannon, Nuclear Missile, and Rift Generator.
-   _Devil May Cry_:
    -   While not to the same extent as the reboot, saying that you liked _Devil May Cry 2_ will cause the fans to destroy you with a powerful Devil Trigger.
    -   Given that _Devil May Cry 3_ is considered by many to be one of the best games in the series, if not _the_ best, speaking negatively about it will get you slashed by Nero with the Yamato.
    -   Just mention _DmC: Devil May Cry_ to a fan. Expect to be slashed apart over things such as the changes to Dante and the Take That!'s to the original continuity.
    -   Even if you can deny it, the absolute banger of a character theme known as "Bury the Light", as featured in the Special Edition of _Devil May Cry 5_, is one that can’t be spoken ill about under any circumstances. If you just happen to do that… To put it mildly, there will not be any motivation to fight back against the fired-up fanbase that _will_ be the storm approaching towards you.
-   _Dino Crisis_: Do not speak positively about _Dino Crisis 3_ or that you liked it, as it's considered a Franchise Killer due to abandoning the Cliffhanger of the second game in favor of dinosaurs IN SPACE.
-   _Doom_: The less said about the Columbine High School shooting, the better. Otherwise prepare to either be blown to smithereens by the Cyberdemon or worse, ripped apart by Doomguy himself.
-   _Donkey Kong Country_:
    -   While most fans won't mind it if you like _Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!_, suggesting you prefer it over _Donkey Kong Country_ or _Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest_ (or Retro's titles) is not recommended unless you want the fandom to throw barrels at you, as it is regarded to be vastly inferior to those games by fans. Likewise, don't say you like Kiddy Kong or that you prefer to play as him over Dixie Kong or fans will throw even more barrels.
    -   As well regarded as _Donkey Kong Country Returns_ and _Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze_ are, in some circles, saying you prefer them over Rare's original trilogy is a good reason for hardcore Rare fans to steal your bananas while you're sleeping and probably shove your little buddy into a barrel.
    -   _Never_ suggest you prefer the Tiki Tong Tribe or even the Snowmads over the Kremlings, unless you want to earn the fandom's wrath and have King K. Rool blow up your home with the Blast-o-Matic.
-   _Dwarf Fortress_: Anyone who doesn't share the fandom's opinion on elves and necessary unnecessary violence will be accused of this sooner or later, and then subject to traditional dwarven punishment by magma... erm, "unfortunate accident", or whatever Death Trap the fandom has for the dissenter.
-   _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_: Do not agree with Delphine or Esbern about killing Paarthunaax despite everything he has done for humanity as well as the Player Character, else you'd be on the receiving end of a very angry Shout.
-   _Fallout_: Due to the very negative reception of the entry, saying that _Fallout 76_ is a good game or that you like it will get you targeted and nuked out of existence by the majority of the _Fallout_ fandom.
-   _Final Fight_: Don't **ever** mention _Final Fight Streetwise_, as fans regard it having killed the franchise by making it a supernatural horror game.
-   _Five Nights at Freddy's_:
    -   Series wide: When it comes to discussing various theories about the series to the fandom, don't even **think** of bringing up the idea that the entire series is just the hallucinations and fever dreams of a brain-damaged child, unless you want to be stuffed inside an animatronic suit.
    -   _Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach_: While you can get away with complaining or criticizing most of the game, never say you don't like Glamrock Freddy, as the fandom widely considers him a Sacred Cow due to his All-Loving Hero nature, Parental Substitute like relationship with Gregory and being the first time that the player actually gets to see an animatronic be as nice as the series has previously claimed them to be. Otherwise you'll be, yet again, stuffed inside an animatronic suit.
-   _Genshin Impact_:
    -   Do not speak positively about Amber from a gameplay perspective, as she's considered to be the weakest character by the fandom. It's perfectly fine to speak positively about her from a story perspective, however.
    -   Do **NOT** bring up the game's first anniversary, as the rewards given out during that event were considered to be _very_ disappointing by the fans.
-   _God of War Ragnarök_: Don't say that Kratos didn't deserve his redemption, otherwise be prepared to be hacked apart with the Blades of Chaos and the Leviathan Axe, both at once.
-   _Goldeneye 1997_: One of the house rules in the fandom is to never play as Oddjob. Even saying you can always point down and shoot at him won't do anything to save you if you play as him.
-   Do not bring up, or worse yet, praise _Snoot Game_ to the _Goodbye Volcano High_ fanbase unless you want a meteor dropped on you, as they regard it as a Shallow Parody made in particularly bad faith and its content flying in the face of what _Goodbye Volcano High_ promotes.
-   _Guilty Gear_: While there is a lot of contentious stuff in every installment of the series, saying you don't like Daisuke Ishiwatari's music will get you hit with every Instant Kill simultaneously and Heavenly Potemkin Bustered for good measure.
-   _Half-Life_: Speaking positively of the mod _Hunt Down the Freeman_ will cause fans to either use the Gravity Gun to send you flying or sic a Headcrab on you. And as for the latter, yeah. It won't be pretty.
-   _Henry Stickmin Series_: Don't _ever_ say that Charles isn't funny or helpful, and **never** say you were okay with his Heroic Sacrifice in the "Valiant Hero" route of _Completing the Mission_.
-   _Honkai Impact 3rd_: One of the mangas for the game had a moment where Seele kissed Bronya. Said kiss had to be removed in accordance with China’s censorship laws. For the sake of your health, don’t ever say that removing the kiss was justified, regardless of the Values Dissonance.
-   _The Idolmaster_: Treating _Idolmaster: Xenoglossia_ as part of _The iDOLM@STER_ is considered by the fanbase as sacrilege, mainly due to it being a mecha anime as well as the characterizations of Yukiho and especially Chihaya. You can get away with liking it _as long_ as you consider it seperate from the rest of the franchise.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_: Whatever you do, never even remotely praise the Time Travel plot point originating in _Kingdom Hearts 3D \[Dream Drop Distance\]_. In the eyes of most fans, it was rushed, rendered everything that the heroes did pointless, and pushed Xehanort straight into Invincible Villain territory.
-   _The King of Fighters_:
    -   While you can get away with hating his personality and actions, actually hating Rugal Bernstein's actual status as a villain or his difficulty as a boss is off-limits, as many fans consider him to be one of SNK's vilest and thus finest antagonists, alongside appreciating the brutal challenge fighting him is. Criticize either, and you'll probably be slashed apart courtesy of the Genocide Cutter.
    -   Saying to the fans that you liked K9999 is generally a bad idea, as even SNK despises the character, eventually removing him from 2002's updated rerelease and replacing him with the more original and likable character Nameless. Do so anyway, especially to fans of Nameless, and expect to be burned alive by a Rinkou.
        -   In _The King of Fighters XV_, it's all but stated the character Krohnen is actually K9999 in disguise, having undergone Character Development and being less of a Tetsuo clone. As a result, it _is_ possible to get away with liking the _current_ iteration of the character.
    -   As practically everyone in the fandom have concluded _The King of Fighters XII_ to be little more than a glorified demo for _The King of Fighters XIII_, expect a total smack down if you say you loved it or consider it to be one of your favorite games of all time.
-   _King's Quest_: It's not a good idea to say that you liked _King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!_, considered to be one of the worst entries in the series. Speaking positively about Cedric will also cause the fandom to gang up on you.
-   _Kirby_ on its own is already a Sacred Cow, but among fans the biggest way to get yourself crucified is to criticize _Kirby Super Star_. The game is considered one of the best in the series and claiming that it's a bad game is sure to get you murdered.
    -   Depending on the fan though, it _is_ possible to get away with saying the Updated Re-release, _Kirby Super Star Ultra_, is better than Super Star.
-   _The Last of Us_:
    -   _The Last of Us_: Do not say that you agree with the Fireflies' decision to sacrifice Ellie for the Cordyceps vaccine<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  or that Joel was in the wrong for massacring the Fireflies in order to save Ellie.
    -   _The Last of Us Part II_: Don't say that Joel deserved to be killed by Abby for his actions in the previous game, or you'll be clubbed just like he was.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   Do NOT criticize _Link to the Past_ or _Ocarina of Time_ to the fandom due to their Sacred Cow status. Do so, and you're going to get CR-UC-IF-IED! Debating over which of the two is the better game, however, is a different story.
    -   On the topic of _Ocarina of Time_, the Water Temple is notably infamous for various reasons and considered to be the worst dungeon in the entire series (even Shigeru Miyamoto apologized for the dungeon). Saying anything positive about the Water Temple (unless its the acclaimed Dark Link miniboss fight), or worse, boasting that the dungeon isn't that hard and those who find it difficult are wimps, and not even the full Triforce will protect you from the fandom's deserved wrath.
-   _Marvel vs. Capcom_: Do not speak positively about _Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite_ to the fandom, due to Executive Meddling turning it into a vehicle for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, heavily favoring the Marvel characters over the Capcom characters, and barring any _Marvel_ characters whose film rights weren't owned by Marvel (mainly _X-Men_ and _Fantastic Four_ characters).
-   _Mass Effect_: Do not mention the original ending to the third game around fans of the series. To put it lightly, it's _widely disliked_.
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   _Mega Man (Classic)_:
        -   _Mega Man 2_ is considered a Sacred Cow in the original series. Saying anything bad about it will have fans blasting you with the Mega Buster.
        -   _Mega Man 10_: Do not bring up the Easy mode. Ever.
    -   _Mega Man X_:
        -   Saying the first game is bad. The sequels all have their fans and detractors, but the first game is considered by many to be, if not the best in the series, one of the best.
        -   Speaking positively about _Mega Man X6_ or saying it's one of your favorites in the series will likely get you yelled at by the fandom, mainly due to its severely rushed state (in America, where it came out first, _Mega Man X6_ was released _the same year_ that _Mega Man X5_ was in that country) and unforgiving difficulty. That said, the one unambiguously positive thing you can say without having to worry about backlash is the soundtrack.
        -   Bringing up _Mega Man X7_ in a positive way is sure to rile up the fandom due to the various problems with the game, mainly the gameplay. If you say you like it or that it's one of your favorite entries in the series, angry fans will want you to "BURN TO THE GROUND!"
    -   _Mega Man Legends_:
        -   Do not say that you dislike the Bonnes, considered to be among the best characters in the series, or else expect a full-scale attack from Servbots and Bonne mechs that Mega Man will not rescue you from.
        -   Do yourself a favor, and don't say you weren't upset with the infamous cancellation of _Mega Man Legends 3_, as fans consider it a great tragedy that effectively killed the _Mega Man Legends_ series. If anything, doing so will result in the same as above.
    -   Do not speak positively about _Rockman X Over_ to the fandom, or else they'll blast/slash you with the Mega Buster/X-Buster/Z-Saber/etc. in response.
-   _Metal Gear_:
    -   Bringing up _anything_ to do with the series after Konami's firing of Hideo Kojima after _Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain_ (not to mention releasing _Metal Gear Solid 3_ Pachinko and _Metal Gear Survive_) will illicit rage from fans.
    -   If Konami ever decides to make a _Metal Gear_ game without Kojima’s involvement, don’t. Ever. Support it. For example, this instantly became the case with the aforementioned _Metal Gear Survive_.
    -   Speaking ill of _Snake Eater_ — the series' Sacred Cow and generally in contention for being one of the greatest video games of all time — is, for lack of a better term, _**ill-advised**_.
    -   _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_: While you can, albeit with much caution, criticize anything else about the game, criticizing the soundtrack will cause you to get beaten down Senator Armstrong-style.
-   _Metroid_:
    -   Best way to get a whoopin'? Criticizing _Super Metroid_. It's unanimously considered a landmark game and a masterpiece of level design and craftsmanship by fans and critics alike. Decades after its release, it is still considered the best game in the entire series and one of the greatest video games _ever made_, so if you go after it, you might need to equip the Varia Suit to resist the flames.
    -   The first _Metroid Prime_ is another game that's considered risky to criticize, since it's often considered to be in the same league as _Super Metroid_ due to how masterfully it navigated the Video Game 3D Leap.
    -   If you say that you liked the gameplay of _Metroid: Other M_, fan opinion is mixed enough that you'll get some amused scoffing at worst. Say that you liked the story on the other hand, or (Chozo forbid) that it is one of your favourite entries in the series, then expect a complete derailment of the conversation as seemingly everyone in the fanbase arrives to signal to Raven Beak that you disrupted the natural order, and it will hurt. **A lot.** At one point, hate for _Other M_ was to the point that even suggesting that the game had the _potential_ to be good garnered the same result.
    -   While no longer the case, prior to the release of future games that proved it wasn't the harbinger for the franchise's death, saying anything kind about _Metroid Prime: Federation Force_ was simply a verbose way of requesting _your_ death at the claws of Ridley. Hate for the spin-off was so strong from the moment of its reveal that even the much-maligned _Other M_ was seen in a better light for a while, due to it having Samus as the protagonist rather than some faceless Federation Space Marines.
-   _Mortal Kombat_: The first three games (with _Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3_ to the extent) are the closest that the franchise has to a Sacred Cow and as such, are highly regarded. Criticizing them will have fans performing a gruesome Fatality on you.
-   _Persona_:
    -   Don't mention the Beginner and Very Easy modes from _Persona 3 Portable_ and _Persona 4 Golden_, respectively, let alone state that you're okay with the existences of these modes, to fans of the series. And if you hold the opinion that it's okay to play on these modes, point out that they're _optional_, or worst of all, **play** on those modes, well...let's just say it's really upsetting that Trafuri doesn't exist in real life.
    -   _Persona 5_: Unless it's a Love to Hate opinion, never say anything positive about any of the game's antagonists, excluding maybe (Akechi and Maruki), due to their various unlikeable natures, or else expect the fanbase to enter your Mental World to deliver a beatdown to your shadow self.
-   _Pokémon_
    -   _Pokémon Red and Blue_: One of the biggest ways to anger the fanbase is to proclaim that Gen I is the only true Pokémon Generation and reject all Generations that came after it, as such closed-minded nostalgia is never tolerated by the fandom. It's still okay to like Gen I or have at as one of your favorites as long as you respect the other Gens, though.
    -   _Pokémon Gold and Silver_: It's not a good idea to speak positively about Delibird, a Pokémon so poor that it's the franchise's poster boy for Joke Characters. You can speak positively about its future Paradox variant Iron Bundle, however.
    -   _Pokémon Diamond and Pearl_:
        -   Go ahead and say that you didn't mind the NPC trade with Mindy <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Fans despise this in-game trade mainly due to its trollish nature.
        -   In many parts of the fandom, criticizing _Pokémon Platinum_ is bound to get you in trouble, as those people consider it one of the best entries in the main series.
    -   _Pokémon Black and White_:
        -   Do not speak positively about the designs of the Vanillite and Trubbish lines, considered by most of the fandom to be among the worst Pokémon designs.
        -   Don't even imply that Ghetsis cared for N in the _slightest_, as it's made pretty clear that he saw N as nothing more than a means to an end and used him in order to fulfill his plans.
        -   Do not say that you didn't like the stories in either pair of games, given that this generation was the first to actually be story and character driven instead of having an Excuse Plot.
        -   Do not speak negatively about _Pokémon Black 2 and White 2_ to the majority of the fandom (unless it's about the game's Bonus Feature Failure due to the Dream World shutting down in 2013), as it's seen in the same positive light as _Platinum_.
    -   _Pokémon X and Y_:
        -   It's not a good idea to say that you were okay with the games not getting follow-ups (such as an Updated Re-release or sequel) of any kind, as it means that the various problems _X and Y_ had will never be fixed.
        -   Don't say anything positive about the postgame, or better yet, lack of postgame, as the only such location is a single town with only one notable attraction.
    -   _Pokémon Sun and Moon_:
        -   Do not say that you like Alolan Dugtrio or Alolan Persian's designs, as most fans consider them to be either lazy or awful.
        -   You're free to praise any of the new additions and changes to _Sun & Moon_ that _Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon_ brought to the table...except the story, which is generally regarded by the fanbase to be far weaker than that of _Sun & Moon_, mostly owing to much of the depth of Lillie's dysfunctional family being removed and many of the new story elements (particularly the Ultra Recon Squad and where they're from) turning out to be superfluous and/or wasted. Saying that the story in US/UM is better than that of the previous games is thus highly unrecommended.
    -   _Pokémon Sword and Shield_: While there's nothing wrong liking anything else about the game, saying that you're okay with "Dexit" (where not every Pokémon can be brought into games starting with _Sword and Shield_) _will_ make at least a lot of trainers in the fanbase want to use Zacian and Zamazenta to annihilate your partner Pokemon out of existence.
    -   _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_: Do not say anything positive about Geeta as a Champion, much less Top Champion, as she's considered to be the worst one in the entire series.
    -   Regarding Pokémon League Champions, Lance, Steven, and especially Cynthia are held in high regard in most parts of the fandom (Cynthia, for instance, is known for having one of the hardest battles in the series) and are considered to be the best Champions in the series. Criticizing any of them is not a good idea unless you want fans to have Lance's Dragonite, Steven's Metagross, or Cynthia's Garchomp annihilate you.
    -   Opinions on villain teams and villain team leaders are quite mixed and stating who is the best/most evil/etc. will at worst lead to debates over your answer, but even thinking about saying anything positive about Team Flare (unless it's the anime version of them) will not go over well with the majority of the fandom. For some reason, it's been decided that they are the worst villain team. If you do, expect many people to say you are a child for liking their plan or saying you are no real fan.
        -   In a similar vein, its not a good idea to speak positively about Team Yell or Macro Cosmos or even say that they're evil, especially since the former is just a group of rabid fans more than anything.
        -   On the other hand, criticizing the villainous aspects of Team Rocket, Team Galactic, or Team Plasma (or their leaders Giovanni, Cyrus, and Ghetsis, respectively) can also be a bad idea, given that each of them are considered to be popular villains in most parts of the fandom.
        -   Largely due to the scale of his plan, the majority of the fandom considers Cyrus (and by extension, Team Galactic) to be the most dangerous and threatening villain in the series. Saying that he isn't can cause them to turn against you.
    -   "We want each region to feel unique." This statement has been used by Game Freak to justify the removal of several beloved game mechanics and quality-of-life features from game to game (the DexNav, walking Pokémon, the PSS etc), often only to replace them with far less-liked replacements. Agreeing with this line of logic is subsequently a good way to get yourself raked over burning coals by the angry fandom.
    -   Given their lore, abilities, and powers over time, space, and creation, Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, and Arceus are considered to be the most powerful Pokémon. Canon-wise, stating an opinion of them not being gods or any Pokémon being more powerful than them is not a good idea. This can also apply to Ultra Necrozma to a lesser extent.
        -   On a related topic, do not say that Dialga and Palkia's signature moves, Roar of Time and Special Rend, aren't canonically the most powerful Pokémon moves, given their effects over time and space.
    -   While the mechanic had started out as divisive when it was first introduced in Generation VI, Mega Evolution has become very well-regarded by most of the fandom, who didn't take kindly to it being Demoted to Extra in Generation VII and omitted completely in Generation VIII and on. Saying you dislike Mega Evolution or saying that mechanics such as Z-Moves, Dynamax, and/or the Terastal phenomenon are superior to it? Well, it's a shame Arceus will not be around to save you.
    -   When it comes to Shiny hunting, never count any guaranteed Shiny encounter (such as Lake of Rage Gyarados, the gift Dratini/Gible, or the Hidden Grotto Haxorus) among the Shinies you caught, as the fandom only considers Shinies that are found by chance in the wild or similar means as such.
    -   Due to three consecutive generations having a Fire/Fighting-type starter line (Blaziken, Infernape, and Emboar), saying that you're okay with any more starter Pokémon having that type combination will set off the fandom. Even a Fire-type starter Pokémon just remotely resembling anything Fighting-type (such as Incineroar or Cinderace) can anger fans.
    -   Drawing any dark-skinned character (ex: Nessa, Bea, Nemona) with a lighter skin tone will upset the fans. It's to the point where _Pokémon: Twilight Wings_, an official production _overseen by Game Freak themselves_, got flak for depicting Bea as light-skinned.
    -   In recent years, the franchise has started to experience overt nostalgia pandering, mainly towards Gen I, with the abundance of Gen I Pokémon present in regional Pokédexes, and the majority of Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax Forms, regional forms, convergent forms, and the like being Gen I Pokémon, which has started to tick off the fanbase as such Pokémon at times overshadow newer ones. Saying you support Game Freak's pandering of older Pokémon will get the rest of the fandom pissed at you.
    -   Overlapping with _Sonic the Hedgehog_, don't even mention _Sonichu_ to the fanbase, or else expect both _Pokémon_ and _Sonic_ fans to unite in order to electrocute you and shred you with the Chaos Emeralds.
-   _Raiden_: Fans will give you a stink-eye if you say that your favorite weapon is anything other than the Bend Plasma, known as the Toothpaste Laser.
-   _Ratchet & Clank_: While they were praised by fans and critics when they first came out, saying that _Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters_ and _Secret Agent Clank_ are great entries will get you blasted by the titular duo's arsenal. Even Insomniac Games themselves tend to ignore these two titles most of the time.
-   _Ridge Racer_: Fans of the series really care whether Reiko Nagase is included in a game, to the point where the games that don't have bombed. Because of this, don't tell a fan that you're okay if Reiko is absent from a game.
-   _Saints Row_:
    -   Do not say anything negative about _Saints Row 2_ unless you want to be buried alive like Shogo. And while _Saints Row: The Third_ and _Saints Row IV_ are okay to like, don't even suggest that they are better than _Saints Row 2_. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Do not say anything positive about either the Alternate Continuity game _Agents of Mayhem_ or the 2022 Continuity Reboot either, or the same as above will happen. The latter was so poorly-received that it was a Creator Killer for Volition.
-   _Silent Hill_:
    -   Do NOT mention _Silent Hill: Homecoming_ to the fandom. Just don't do it. Save yourself the headache you'll get from facing Pyramid Head if you consider doing so.
    -   If you value your life, do _not_ bring up what happened with _Silent Hills_ to the fans, much less say you were okay with its infamous cancellation. The less said about this, the better, and doing so will get you instantly killed by Pyramid Head.
-   _Skullgirls_: **Never** say that you approve of the current owners of the franchise removing all Fanservice from the series, or else the entire fandom will pummel you.
-   _Sly Cooper_: Saying you approve of Penelope's Face–Heel Turn in _Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time_ or the ending of the game will garner the hate of the fandom, many of which have even disowned the game to preserve the happy ending of _Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves_. Some fans even apply this to the entire game overall.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_:
    -   The Sega Genesis games <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  are the closest that the franchise has to a Sacred Cow and are held in high regard by most of the fandom. Criticizing them is a good way to set them off. The same can also go for _Sonic Mania_.
    -   It's not a good idea to say that _Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)_ was a good game or that you liked it, given the many problems with it, such as its rushed and unfinished nature, its incoherent story, its numerous amounts of glitches and bugs, or the character of Princess Elise, who is also notorious for kissing a dead Sonic. This also goes for _Sonic Boom_ for the same reasons.
        -   Conversely, saying anything negative about _Sonic '06_'s soundtrack or the villain Mephiles the Dark can also be a bad idea.
    -   Most Russian _Sonic_ fans first discovered the Sonic series in the _Adventure_ era with _Sonic Adventure_ and the _Sonic X_ anime, thus they consider the Darker and Edgier plots and atmosphere a Sacred Cow. Any mention of _Sonic Lost World_ or the _Sonic Boom_ franchise in a positive light will turn them against you.
    -   People who got into the franchise through _Sonic X_ are more likely to call Sonic "Sonikku" than those who got into it through other media. Calling Sonic that, even if you justify it in your fanworks as an Affectionate Nickname Amy gives Sonic, will cause the fanbase to do the dirty work of nailing you with a Super Peel-Out.
    -   Whatever you do, _do not_ tell any number of the fanbase that you agree with the "Sonic Mandates", as these rules that Sega has made in recent years that restrict various things that were created beforehand has caused untold amounts of damage on the entire franchise. Most notably, "Classic" and "Modern" Sonic are meant to be separate from one another, with characters or elements that have only appeared in one forbidden from appearing in the other. For example, "Classic" characters such as Mighty, Ray, and Nack/Fang cannot appear in anything "Modern", while "Modern" characters such as Shadow, Cream, and Blaze cannot appear in anything "Classic". These mandates effectively limit what can be done with the _Sonic_ universe, and if you do decide to tell the public your positive opinion on the guidelines... to put it mildly, it's too bad the Chaos Emeralds haven't become a reality yet.
-   _Splatoon_ has a rather fractured fanbase, but a few opinions will make the Big Runs look like a nice walk in the park compared to what the fans will to do you.
    -   Saying you dislike any of the Idol Singer characters — especially Marie, Marina, or any member of Deep Cut — is a great way to get almost every fan of the series to launch Tenta Missiles at your head.
    -   If you _really_ want the ink to fly, say you ship Pearl and Marina with anyone except each other; the two are quite heavily Implied Love Interests, and there's enough Ship Tease for "Pearlina" (including Marina canonically having a crush on Pearl) that most fans of the characters consider it a One True Pairing anyway.
-   _Star Fox_:
    -   A good way to get yourself lynched by the fandom is to criticize _Star Fox 64_, as it's considered a Sacred Cow and the best entry in the series, with none of the entries that came after able to match it.
    -   Bringing up the quality of _Star Fox Zero_ will irk a number of fans, but speak positively of the gyro-based controls the game has, and fans will blast you without warning.
-   _Street Fighter_:
    -   _Street Fighter II_ and _Street Fighter IV_ (with the updated editions to an extent) are considered Sacred Cows. Criticizing them will set off fans to perform a Super Combo on you in a most brutal fashion.
    -   While liking _Street Fighter III_ is fine, saying it's better than _II_ will earn a bit of an ire, most likely due to Akira Yasuda's regret.
    -   Don't say that you like the vanilla version of _Street Fighter V_ over the _Arcade Edition_ and _Champion Edition_.
-   _Streets of Rage_: Saying that you prefer the localized version of _Streets of Rage 3_ over the Japanese version, due to its bowdlerization, changing the story, increasing the difficulty, and ending the game at Stage 5 on Easy, will get you beat up by every playable character in the series.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   Similar to the "Sonic Mandates" above, the "Mario Mandates", as they're called, are rules that Nintendo has made which dictate what creators can and can't do when designing _Mario_ characters. This forbids the creation of unique characters that are various Mario races (Goombas, Koopas, Toads, etc.) starting with games such as _Paper Mario: Sticker Star_ and forbids the re-appearance of any such characters made before the mandates, which greatly restricts creativity and forces such characters and enemies to look more generic. Saying that you support these mandates to any fan of the franchise will result in you being left at Bowser's mercy, complete with him ripping a chunk of hair off your moustache just for good measure.
    -   Do not say that Mario and Luigi's last name is "Mario" (and if Word of God says it is, don't accept it as such) unless you want the fandom to roast you with Fire Flowers.
    -   _Super Mario Bros._, _Super Mario Bros. 3_, and _Super Mario World_ are basically Sacred Cows, so criticizing any of them will cause the fandom to pummel you.
    -   _Super Mario Galaxy_: You're better off not speaking positively about the Spring Mushroom, due to its awkward movement and controls.
    -   _Paper Mario_:
        -   Do not say that _Paper Mario 64_ and/or _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_ aren't the best games in the series unless you want a whooping. Which of the two is better than the other happens to be a different discussion, however.
        -   Even so much as mentioning _Paper Mario: Sticker Star_ around seasoned _Paper Mario_ fans is enough to result in the same thing as the above, for reasons such as dumbing down the story or having generic Toads all over the place at the expense of other NPC Mario characters (caused by the "Mario Mandates" above). If you imply that you think _Sticker Star_ is better than any of the first three games (especially _64_ and _The Thousand Year Door_), you're in for even more of a world of hurt from the fandom. _The Origami King_ is generally safe to bring up, and while _Color Splash_ is a Contested Sequel, it doesn't attract the same level of vitriol as _Sticker Star_.
        -   Saying anything bad about Vivian, who is considered to be one of the best _Mario_ characters _period_ due to a combination of her sympathetic backstory, her Character Development where she gains the will to defy her Big Sister Bully, her usefulness in combat, her unique design, and being one of the best representations of a transgender character in video games, will result in the fanbase forcing you to fight both Bonetail and the Shadow Queen at once.
-   _Super Smash Bros._:
    -   _Super Smash Bros. Melee_ is held in high regard by the _Smash_ community. Regardless of opinions of any of the other games in the series, never say anything negative about _Melee_.
    -   Do not voice any approval for _Brawl_'s random tripping, as both casual and competitive fans regard it as an unfun Scrappy Mechanic, and was additionally seen as a bad idea in hindsight by Masahiro Sakurai himself, enough to be dropped from future games.
-   _Team Fortress 2_: While it's all right as a fan to talk shit about the game receiving no support from Valve, individual weapons, playstyles, Fandom VIPs, etc., saying you don't like the game itself is a great way to get crocketed by a Soldier with an Australium rocket launcher, as the game is one of if not THE biggest Sacred Cows in the entire FPS genre.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Touhou Project_: When it comes to the fandom, something you shouldn't do is criticize Sakuya Izayoi or say she's a bad character. Otherwise, expect lots of angry fans, especially those that are fans of the earlier Windows era games such as _Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil_, to send dozens of knives your way.
-   When it comes to _ULTRAKILL_ weapons, the Alternate Marksman is by far the worst of any Scrappy Weapon in the game, due to its mechanics which trade crowd control splitshots of its original versions for single-target ricochet damage boost, seen by the fandom as much more inferior given how the niche could both be filled through the alternate variant of the Piercer, and how it's a loss of a _crucial_ crowd control attack in the player's arsenal. To that end, you're better off not using the weapon at all, because you'd likely get scorned real bad for having the thought of that cross you. Even the wiki gets in on it:
-   _Undertale_: Due to everything that he has gone through, it is considered especially bad etiquette to either refuse to forgive Asriel, or not provide him a Cooldown Hug. Otherwise be ready to have a bad time with Sans.
-   _Until Dawn_: Do not hate Wolfie, and do not under any circumstances let him die. Otherwise, the fandom will be locking you outside and leaving you to be ripped apart.
-   It's considered taboo if you prefer the original arcade version of _U.N. Squadron_ (_Area 88_ in Japan) over the SNES port.
-   Do not bring up _Valis X_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in front of the _Valis_ fandom, as they regard it as having killed the franchise by making it mindless porn.
-   _Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune_: Don't mention Honda in relation to this game. This partly has to do with Honda not being known for rear-wheel drive vehicles, let alone 4WD, other than the S2000 and the NSX (which was finally added in _Maximum Tune 5DX+_) and the game is heavily focused around powersliding, something that wouldn't make sense in a FWD car.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles_:
    -   Treating _Xenoblade Chronicles 1_ as anything less but one of the best games ever or opposing Shulk being in _Super Smash Bros._ does not sit well with fans.
    -   For _Xenoblade Chronicles X_, do **not** mention the censorship to fans. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  The resulting backlash can put Cauldros to shame.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_: Do not tell a fan that you didn't find _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Justice For All_'s final case exciting, as it's considered to be one of the best cases if not _the_ best case in the series.
    -   On the subject of _Justice for All_, splurging out anything positive about the game's widely hated third case will cause the fandom to prosecute you so hard even Phoenix Wright himself wouldn't be able to get you out of it. Unless you're speaking of the anime edition, to which the fandom will pull a 180 and vouch for your acquittal, allowing Phoenix Wright to pull an easy 'Not Guilty' verdict.
-   _Danganronpa_:
    -   The third trial from _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_ has gained a **whole lot** of infamy from the fandom, due to reasons such as Mikan Tsumiki's motive being the much-maligned Despair Disease, the fact that it would have been impossible for her to pull off both murders in the way and timeframe she did, that Hiyoko Saionji's murder wasn't elaborated upon, the rushed nature of the trial itself, or most infamously, Mikan's execution. As such, it's not a good idea to mention anything positive about it, and if you do, just be sure prepared for what brutal execution you'll get from the thousands of fired-up individuals, especially those who like Mikan.
    -   For _Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls_, do not say anything good about Haiji Towa, considered by the fandom to be the most hated character in the whole series.
-   _Doki Doki Literature Club!_:
    -   Do not say that Monika did nothing wrong, or else the fandom will delete you. You're still allowed to sympathize with Monika, like her, or say that her actions were understandable, but don't ever say she was in the right for what she did to Sayori, Natsuki, and Yuri.
    -   Saying even the _slightest_ thing positive about Natsuki's father, due to his all but explicitly stated treatment of Natsuki, or that he's not as bad as fans make him out to be, will lead to your death **and** deletion, especially since despite never actually appearing, he's very unlikable.
-   _Renai X Royale_: Speaking positively about Mari with get you in trouble with fans and readers, mainly due to her personality as well as her actions, both past and present, towards the main character. Speaking negatively about Yuna will get you in trouble with pretty much those same people.
-   _Tsukihime_: When it comes to the fanbase (as well as fans of the _Nasuverse_ as a whole), one way to make them want to suck the blood out of you is making a **single** mention of the anime _Shingetsutan Tsukihime_. In fact, there's no Tsukihime anime as far as they're concerned.

    Web Animation 

-   _DEATH BATTLE!_:
    -   While most if not all Death Battles have at least some contention regarding their victors from watchers, a literal death battle will ensure if you approve of who the victors were in _Gaara vs Toph_, _Yang vs Tifa_, _Ben 10 vs Green Lantern_, or, most infamously of all, the second _Goku_ vs _Superman_ fight, as those four are despised by fans for reasons such as flawed research, accusations of favoritism, or even the victor cheating.
    -   On the other hand, there are a few bouts where nobody disagrees with the results and doing so is not a good idea. For example, everyone is in agreement that _Omni-Man vs. Homelander_ had the correct victor, and any dissent will lead to the 3 fandoms coming at you to feed you your own heart, especially when considering that even the official Twitter accounts for both series approved the outcome.
-   _GoAnimate_: Don't _ever_ defend the character who got grounded, or else be prepared to be the one to have a Punishment Day, courtesy of Boris himself.
-   _Happy Tree Friends_: Even just belting out that "Youtube Copyright School" is not a bad episode to fans of the series is a surefire way to have them out for blood, as it's seen as less of an episode of HTF and more of a punishment for uploaders who get a copyright strike on YouTube <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   _Helluva Boss_: You really want to tick off some HB fans in record time? Create/like any NSFW works featuring Octavia, Stolas' 17-year old daughter, for obvious reasons. Even 'questionable' artwork of her will have them clamoring to have you blocked and reported, and no amount of arguing 'it's just a 2d drawing' or 'it's fictional' will dissuade them.
    -   On a lesser but still infuriating note, attempting to do any problematic ships will also cause outrage.
-   _hololive_: Do **not** say that you approved of Rushia Uruha's termination, or else the fandom will scream at you as loudly as she does.
-   _RWBY_:
-   _SMG4_: Even just saying something mildly positive about Francis or that you're okay with him will lead you to experience the fury of a thousand sun-related memes and get sent to the Cancelled Dimension (or The Internet Graveyard), as he's considered by the fandom to be one of the most despicable villains in the series, especially since he killed Desti.

    Web Original 

-   _Channel Awesome_: For all that is holy, **never** speak positively about _To Boldly Flee_, as the movie is considered not only to be awful, but what started the fall of _Channel Awesome_ as a whole.
-   _YouTube_:
    -   It's best for you not to say you were fond of any YouTube Rewind from 2018 onwards, as they're despised by viewers of the platform and contain far more dislikes than likes as a result.
    -   Speaking of dislikes, saying you approve of the site's removal of the dislike feature (the button's still there but the dislike count isn't viewable by the public) is the best and easiest way to get decried by basically everybody on the platform, likely in the form of several lengthy video essays. In addition, saying you approve of the heightened censorship and mislabeling of videos "for kids" due to COPPA, the increasing amount of videos whose comment sections have been disabled (both kids and music videos), and the heightened amount of inconvenient advertisements will get you a similar reaction.
    -   If you even have a _slight_ approval of fraudulent copyright strikes, expect the whole of Youtube userbase to start a violent Flame War on you.
-   _The Rising of the Shield Hero_: Do you like Princess Malty in any way other than a Love to Hate manner? Are you sexually attracted to her? Then, good on you. You just earned the combined wrath of the entire fandom.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_:
    -   One way to get yourself chastised by fellow amateur geniuses is to say good things about the infamous _Planet Sheen_ to fans of the original show, as they have no fondness for it, especially since _Planet Sheen_ crashed and burned not long after debuting. It's rather telling that even John A. Davis, Jimmy Neutron's creator, went on to say that he found a whole show focused on Sheen a _very_ bad idea, since in his words, Sheen is a character who works better in "small doses".
    -   Never, _ever_ ship Jimmy with Betty. He's supposed to be with Cindy.
-   _Adventure Time_:
    -   Do not say anything negative about Marceline, unless you want the fandom the suck out all the red from you.
    -   While you don't necessarily have to have it as your favorite pairing, speaking negatively of Bubbline (Bubblegum and Marceline) will get you in trouble with most of the fandom mainly due to them kissing and becoming a couple again in the Grand Finale.
-   _American Dad!_:
    -   Don't say anything positive about "American Fung", which is the most hated episode of the entire series.
    -   Saying that you don't like "Gold Top Nuts" will get you referred to as a "Tiffany's boyfriend".
-   _Amphibia_:
    -   Mentioning AdmiralDT8 anywhere would cause, at minimum, people to react in total disgust and mockery, and at most, all Disney lovers around the world to slam into your house at breakneck speed, break off the cord of your monitor, and fire a massive beam at whatever's in there point blank, destroying them once and for all. There is a **extremely good** reason why discussion of him is outright banned in some parts of the fandom to the point where bringing him up in social media is highly discouraged. <sup>why&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Drawing Anne's hair with points instead of curves will bound to get people angry at you and your artwork. It got so far as to people criticising the show's creator for drawing Anne "incorrectly".
-   _Arthur_: Do not say anything positive about the episodes "Arthur's Big Hit" (which even _Arthur_'s creator Marc Brown disliked) or "So Funny I Forgot to Laugh".
-   _Avatar_ franchise:
    -   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
        -   So much as mentioning the live-action movie will lead to trouble. At least half the fandom refuses to acknowledge that it exists and the other half that does sincerely wishes it didn't; this includes the creators of the animated series themselves.
        -   It is strongly discouraged to trash Uncle Iroh for any reason whatsoever.
        -   When it comes to villains, do not say that you dislike Azula, considered to be one of the most popular and competent villains in the series.
    -   _Legend of Korra_: When it comes to Shipping, the fandom has this rule: Never hate on Korra/Asami, due to the fact that they became an Official Couple at the end of the series, notable for being one of the first confirmed same-sex couples in children's Western Animation. It's doesn't have to be your favorite ship, however, you can ship her with someone else but hating the ship or using a Die for Our Ship is a big no-no.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_:
    -   Don't admit you like "I've Got Batman in My Basement" unless you want to be attacked by vultures, as it's widely regarded by fans and the show's staff as the worst episode in the entire series.
    -   Don't say anything positive about the episode "The Terrible Trio", as Bruce Timm isn't too fond of.
    -   Saying you like the Joker's infamous redesign in _The New Batman Adventures_ is a good way to find yourself thrown out of a window by Mr. J, given how widely hated the redesign is (even by the staff of the show).
-   _Beavis and Butt-Head_: Do not say anything negative about "The Great Cornholio", as it is considered by the fandom to be the best episode ever made.
-   _Ben 10_: For reasons similar to _The Powerpuff Girls (2016)_ and _Teen Titans Go!_ below, mentioning the reboot to the _Ben 10_ fandom will lead to them bringing up a strong alien in the Omnitrix to use to utterly destroy you.
-   _Blue's Clues_: While you can say you didn't mind any hosts after Steve (such as Joe) or even that you liked any of them, never say any of them was a better host that Steve unless you want fans to call you some very unpleasant things.
-   _The Boondocks_: Do not tell a fan that there is a fourth season. Even \[adult swim\] themselves said that it does not exist.
-   Cartoon Network:
    -   It's probably best that you don't mention _any_ of the channel's live-action shows around fans of the channel. To put it simply, their hate is so massive that this very wiki's page for them had to be cut in the past.
    -   The channel has an... infamous reputation regarding its reboots of various cartoons from fans of the channel and said cartoons. Saying that you like _any_ of their reboots will not end well for you.
-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_: Saying that the show shouldn't have gotten the _Galactic Kids Next Door_ sequel series or saying that you agreed with Cartoon Network's reasoning for rejecting it (namely, they claimed that they weren't interested in giving old shows another run, only to Greenlight the Ben 10 and Powerpuff Girls reboots in the same year) will result in every Kids Next Door operative gunning for your head.
-   _Danny Phantom_:
    -   Just bringing up Word of God saying that all the ghosts in the series, sent to the Ghost Zone or otherwise, are actually monsters from another dimension can motivate the fans to make you a sitting duck for mockery and humility, as the general consensus is that it doesn't make sense and goes against the series as a whole. In fact, even the show's wiki rejects this explanation.
    -   Saying that you liked the Grand Finale Phantom Planet (or even Season 3 in its entirety) will get you on the fandom's bad side due to the direction fans consider it to have gone down.
-   _Doug_: Do you consider the Disney run to be better than the Nickelodeon run? Because if you do, make sure you're wearing asbestos underwear for when angry fans flame you.
-   _DuckTales (2017)_: Unlike his 1987 counterpart, it's not a good idea to say anything positive about Doofus Drake.
-   _Ed, Edd n Eddy_: Do not say anything even a _little_ bit positive about Sarah or Lee Kanker.
-   _The Fairly Oddparents_:
    -   Saying that you liked the three live-action movies <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  will most likely enrage the fandom, especially those who are fans of _Channel Chasers_. Even considering them canon can lead to this <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
    -   Similarly, do **not** say anything positive about the live-action spinoff/reboot _The Fairly Oddparents Fairly Odder_, as it's just as hated as the live-action movies.
    -   While saying you like Poof will still have half the fandom defend your opinion, and saying you like Chloe will only lead to some upset fans, saying you like Sparky or that he's a good character to the fandom will cause the flames to be seen all the way to Yugopotamia. Even critics, staff members, and network executives hated the character, leading to his immediate removal come the following season.
    -   Do not say that _Channel Chasers_ was a bad special, as the fandom considers it to be the best entry in the entire series. The most you can get away with is saying it has a couple flaws, but even that's pushing it.
    -   Saying you liked the infamous episode "It's a Wishful Life" or that it was a good episode will get the fandom angry at you, as even the writers and Butch Hartman themselves don't look fondly on it.
    -   Speaking positively about how Trixie Tang was handled in the episode "Just the Two of Us" can get you in trouble by fans, due to how the episode ended up turning Trixie into a crazed Yandere.
    -   When it comes to Shipping, do not speak negatively about Timmy/Tootie to the fandom, unless you want the majority of them to attack you. Unlike other examples, however, you can still ship Timmy with someone else, but using Die for Our Ship with Timmy/Tootie is a big no.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   While saying that you like the post-cancellation seasons will have half the fandom defend your opinion, it is **not** a good idea to say that you enjoyed "Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q". Even people who are willing to defend the later seasons hate that episode.
    -   Similarly, if you liked "Seahorse Seashell Party", it's best to keep that opinion to yourself. Again, much like "Screams of Silence", not even fans of the later seasons like that episode.
    -   Bringing up Brian's fake-out death is a good way to piss off the fandom, as everyone agreed that it was a terrible ratings stunt and that the four episodes involving it were written extremely poorly.
-   _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_: "Everyone Knows It's Bendy" was already very disliked upon its initial airing, mainly because of the plot being mostly driven by the characters acting like idiots or out-of-character, but has progressively gathered more and more hatred among fans of the series and even people outside of the fandom for just about every single aspect they can point out at the titular Bendy instead, to the point that they place him among the worst of their character/general opinions seemingly for the sake of getting some kicks (even Lauren Faust herself has admitted to hating Bendy). Any small mention or speech about the episode or Bendy being good in the slightest is guaranteed to get you relentlessly, messily pummeled with neverending, burning hatred.
-   _Gargoyles_: Do not tell the fandom there is a third season, especially since Greg Weisman and the comic book continuation say otherwise.
-   _Gravity Falls_:
    -   The fandom has an interesting one. Alex Hirsch had originally Jossed that they are before stating that the twins were raised non-religiously, but if you even dare to suggest the Pines collectively aren't Jewish, even if you phrase it in a way where they're still Jewish _theoretically_ speaking, you'll be met with quite a bit of hate, whether or not you try to bring up what Alex said.
    -   In an interesting case, while the character was initially disliked for understandable reasons, after the episode "Northwest Mansion Mystery", which revealed the cause of her behavior, and her ultimate decision to oppose it, it's now a bad idea to say anything negative about Pacifica Northwest. And don't say that you don't like the ship of her with Dipper Pines.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Hey Arnold!_:
    -   When it comes to the fandom, do not say that you ship Arnold/Lila. He's supposed to be with Helga, especially with _Hey Arnold! The Jungle Movie_ making them an Official Couple.
    -   Disliking Helga, bashing her, or calling her ugly is one of the most excessive ways to rile up the fanbase.
    -   Don't say anything positive about "Arnold Betrays Iggy", which is unanimously considered to be the worst episode of the series.
    -   On the other side of the spectrum, don't say anything negative about "Helga on the Couch", considered to be one of the best episodes of the series.
-   _Kid vs. Kat_: When it comes to Shipping, shipping Coop with Phoebe is a _huge_ no-no. Fans prefer him to be with Fiona.
-   _The Loud House_: Never, _ever_ ship Lori and Bobby with anybody but each other.
-   _Miraculous Ladybug_:
    -   Do not even dare to say anything good about the episode "Chameleon", or say that it wasn't as bad as most fans claim. It's easily the most disliked episode of the entire series for a reason.
    -   It's not a good idea to bring up Thomas Astruc's decision to have Chloe join the Big Bad at the end of Season 3, as fans are upset over the fact that it means her redemption arc was thrown out the window, especially after it was shown she could change.
    -   Don't ever speak positively about Félix to the fandom, mainly due to his personality and actions. In fact, Thomas Astruc deliberately made him a _major_ Hate Sink.
    -   It is **not** a good idea to be a fan of or say anything even a _little_ bit positive about Lila Rossi.
-   _Moral Orel_: While it's acceptable to like him based on the merits of how he's written, suggesting that Clay Puppington is in anyway sympathetic or redeemable is a horrible idea unless you want eternal damnation, especially given how he treats Orel. There's a reason many fans cite "Nature" as one of the most realistic portrayals of physical/emotional abuse at the hands of an alcoholic parent in all of media.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: It's **not** a good idea to say anything negative about Fluttershy.
-   _Ninjago_:
    -   It's generally a bad idea to bring up Season 11 around Ninjago fans and an even worse idea to say it was your favorite season.
    -   Similar to Season 11, fans tend not to be particularly pleased when Hands of Time is brought up, though they tend to be more forgiving about it than with Season 11.
    -   Saying anything bad about the Oni Trilogy (Sons of Garmadon, Hunted, and March of the Oni) _will_ get you Spinjitzu'd in the face. The best you can get away with is saying that March of the Oni was lackluster compared to the other two.
    -   Before the Oni Trilogy, the one season you couldn't insult was Possession, at the time considered to be the show's best season and even nowadays considered to be very strong.
    -   Do _not_ bring up the brief love triangle between Jay, Cole, and Nya. It is commonly considered the _worst_ thing the show's ever done and, depending on the fan, may even be considered worse than Season 11.
-   _The Owl House_:
    -   Unless you want the fandom to send a death hex to you, don't ship Luz and Amity with _anyone_ but each other (_especially_ not with Hunter) or say you dislike the two as a pairing, since they're the Official Couple and the One True Pairing of the show.
    -   Alternatively, suggesting you ship Amity with _any_ of the male characters is not a wise move and is a guaranteed way to get labeled as a lesbophobe by nerds everywhere due to the fact that she is canonically a lesbian in the show.
-   _Pinky and the Brain_: The fandom has one rule: ganging up on anybody who mentions _Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain_ to them. To put it simply, the _Pinky and the Brain_ writers themselves were against it, making an episode demonstrating why adding a third character to the show was _not_ a good idea, and the 2020 Animaniacs reboot in fact completely ignores the spin-off.
-   _The Powerpuff Girls_: A easy way to get beaten up by the girls themselves is to say anything positive about the 2016 reboot to the fandom, for reasons such as animation errors, the episode "Horn Sweet Horn'', shoehorned references to current memes and trends, or other unpopular changes made over the original cartoon.
-   _Ren & Stimpy_: Do yourself a favor, and never bring up _Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"_ in a positive way to a fan, or they'll do to you what Ren threatened to do to Stimpy and Sven in ''Sven Hoek".
-   _Rick and Morty_:
    -   Saying that Season 5's "Rickdepedence Spray" was a good, great, or one of the best episodes of the show will eventually lead to most of the fandom brutally murdering you and throwing your corpse out into space, mainly due to the premise and conclusion of the episode featuring _heavy_ amounts of Squick, up to the point of Nausea Fuel.
    -   The same rule applies to all enjoyers of any of the incest-related plots, such as the giant incest baby, Beth making out with her clone (although that's more selfcest), or a fortune cookie predicting Jerry would have sex with his mother.
-   _Samurai Jack_:
    -   Saying that you were okay with Season 5's premiere being suddenly delayed in favor of the Season 3 premiere of _Rick and Morty_ is enough to stir up rage from most fans, mainly due to the action being considered trollish towards _Samurai Jack_ fans.
    -   Unless you have the need to get your arms sliced open by multiple swords, **NEVER** bring up Ashi's death at the end of the series to fans of the show. The event was so negatively received that the canonical game _Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time_ did away with the scene in question with Ashi surviving in the Golden Ending.
-   _Scooby-Doo_:
    -   Do not say that Scrappy-Doo is better than the core five characters, or else the fandom will gang up on you. Remember, he's the Trope Namer for The Scrappy for a reason.
    -   Don't say anything negative about _Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated_, as it's often considered to be one of the best shows in the franchise, maybe even _the_ best.
    -   Don't even _think_ of saying anything that isn't negative about _Velma_ to the fandom - due to its reviled reception - as those meddling kids won't let you get away with it.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Do not speak positively about the infamous episode "The Principal and the Pauper'', or else you will receive the sentence for anyone in Springfield bringing up the events of the episode, which is punishment by torture.
    -   Under no circumstances should you say you liked "Lisa Goes Gaga" or "The Musk Who Fell To Earth" either, as both of these episodes are even _more_ reviled than "The Principal and the Pauper".
    -   Do not ship Patty Bouvier with any male characters as she is canonically a lesbian in the show.
    -   Likewise, do not ship Waylon Smithers with any female characters, as he's canonically gay. (And even when shipping him with male characters, tread carefully, as Burns x Smithers and Moe x Smithers shippers can get quite... _territorial_ about their respective ships.)
-   _South Park_: It is _**NOT**_ a good idea to say that Stephen and Linda Stotch are your favorite characters (or say anything remotely positive about Stephen and Linda in general). Otherwise, bad things will happen. Very, _very, VERY, **VERY**_ bad things, and meeting the same gruesome fate as Chef is only the tip of the iceberg.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_:
    -   If you ever speak positively about the spin-offs _Kamp Koral_ or _The Patrick Star Show_ to those who mainly consider the original 3 seasons to be the pinnacle of the show, expect them to subsequently string you up in a major city's town square for all to see, mainly because they consider them a desecration of the late Stephen Hillenburg's wishes.
    -   Saying anything negative about the episodes "Band Geeks", "Chocolate With Nuts", or "Idiot Box", considered by the fandom to be the holy trinity of _SpongeBob_ episodes, will get you forcefully put into a box and sent to a marching band to be traded for chocolate.
    -   Speaking positively of the infamous episode "One Coarse Meal" is a good way to land yourself on the fandom's hit list, especially since all of the cast and even one of the co-writers don't look fondly upon it.
    -   For similar reasons to the above example, if you liked "A Pal for Gary", better keep that opinion to yourself.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_:
    -   Do not say anything negative about this series. While it was rather contentious early on, it improved significantly over time, to the point where it's widely considered to be the best animated _Star Wars_ series, one of the best _Star Wars_ TV series overall (alongside _The Mandalorian_ and _Andor_) and better than the Prequel Trilogy films.
    -   Ahsoka Tano is a character who is considered sacred by the fandom, and saying anything negative about her can and will lead to you being targeted and then fired at by both Death Stars, Starkiller Base, and every single Xyston-class Star Destroyer, all at once. Interestingly, Ahsoka started off as mainly disliked, but as time went on and she was given notable Character Development, she cemented herself as a popular character, showing that she had to gain the positive reputation she has today, something the fans say she has earned and, at the end of the day, simply makes the aforementioned all the more justified.
    -   Do not speak positively about Pong Krell to the fandom, other than to praise him as a villain. To put it simply, he's to the _Star Wars_ fandom what Dolores Umbridge is to the _Harry Potter_ fandom.
    -   Don't say anything negative about Darth Maul's return, as it's agreed that Maul was an under-utilized character in _The Phantom Menace_ as well as the arcs featuring him being some of the best arcs in _Star Wars_.
-   _Teen Titans (2003)_: Even so much as mentioning _Teen Titans Go!_, much less that you like it, to geeks, nerds, animation addicts and superhero fans everywhere can and will be quite a painful experience, as you're be facing a entire barrage of rants about why the show itself is poisoning the goodwill of animated television adaptions of iconic DC Comics brands. While the show is widely hated across the board, it's especially _**dangerous**_ to bring it up to fans of the original show.
-   _Thomas & Friends_: Don't _ever_ say that you like Seasons 8-16, Seasons 22-24, or _**especially**_ the _All Engines Go_ reboot, or else the fandom will do to you either what 'Arry and Bert tried to do to Stepney or what happened to Smudger, and it won't be pretty.
-   _Total Drama_:
    -   If you liked/enjoyed _All-Stars_, keep that opinion to yourself.
    -   It is **not** a good idea to say that "Sundae Muddy Sundae" is your favorite episode. If you do, there's a good chance you might get eliminated by the fans.
    -   On the flipside, saying you dislike _Island_ is asking to be thrown off a 10,000 foot cliff into a lake with sharks.
