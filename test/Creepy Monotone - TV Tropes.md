_"He kept giving these line readings with all this inflection in them. I kept telling them that it had to be less, a lot less — like a robot. He kept saying it sounded so flat. Everybody else was looking at me too and was asking me if I was sure. To them, it sounded flat. I think it really sells it."_

Normally, people who are calm tend to speak in a clear, even voice that doesn't vary too much from word to word and is immensely reassuring to the listener. This isn't always a good thing, however. A perfectly monotone voice usually means just the opposite of sanity, safety, and cause for reassurance; usually, it means the speaker is mind-controlled, crazy, an impostor, or is being threatened with death. In these cases, the creepy monotone is a sort of Glamour Failure to clue in the hero that any of a dozen things may have just gone wrong.

Usually, the creepy monotone varies from a calm monotone in that no word or syllable is stressed _at all_, even when they should be. This is the difference between saying "Oh hello!" and "Oh, hello." Even Spock Speak sounds more natural and less unsettling by comparison. Contractions are often omitted, as are specific or explicit mentions of names and facts, depending on the cause of the monotone. Here are some common scenarios for the Creepy Monotone.

-   _"Yes, I am fine. I'll be even better once I load my gun, though."_ The character has just suffered a Heroic BSoD or one too many rounds of Break the Cutie and/or is about to go completely homicidally berserk. Usually paired with jittery motions, twitching, or a Broken Smile.
-   _"Hello, do you have some raw meat?"_ One of the hero's friends or family has been Demonically Possessed, Brainwashed, or mind controlled via The Virus and are exhibiting Virus-Victim Symptoms. Usually, they're normal, except for odd behavior.
-   _"Good morning annoying sibling, I am your sister Melanie."_ An evil duplicate (Robot, Clone, Shapeshifter, Doppleganger, or what have you, even zombie/ghost possession/mind control) has replaced the character. Their tell will usually be not knowing names and facts about their host and friends, knowing _too much_ about their host, assuring everyone that they are Most Definitely Not a Villain, or a radically different personality. May be Too Dumb to Live at things the real one — or even anyone without too much Fish out of Temporal Water and minimal Genre Blindness — could do perfectly fine. A _protagonist_ doing this, impersonating the _hero_ while the hero is doing something else, is almost inevitably going to be the one that will be the most idiotic and provide either Fanservice or tons of Squick and Fan Disservice.
-   _"Yes, dear. I'm fine. Please bring the MacGuffin to the Haunted Castle, won't you?"_ Hubby is being coerced by force to trick the hero into a trap, often includes an Out-of-Character Alert to try cluing the hero in to their being kidnapped. "How is our pet poodle Muffin?"
-   _"I am sorry. If it's any consolation, this likely won't hurt much."_ If a character is _introduced_ speaking like this, then all bets are off. If you're lucky, they're just an Emotionless Girl or The Stoic, but odds are they're an Evil A.I., Sociopath, Ax-Crazy, or some other seriously dangerous character.
-   _"Hello! My name is Sally! It is very nice to meet you!"_ A case of Vocal Dissonance leads people to think her naturally frigid, emotionless, unfriendly voice means she's evil or at least an Emotionless Girl but she's actually a very warm-hearted, friendly, and kind person. She just happens to have a voice that can turn your blood to icewater instantly. People's first perceptions become a running gag.

Machine Monotone is a Sub-Trope. You may wish to compare Dissonant Serenity. Can make a very effective Deadpan Snarker. Compare Tranquil Fury, Alternate Catchphrase Inflection, and Voice of the Legion.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Morgana in _.hack//SIGN._
-   R. Dorothy Wayneright from _The Big O_ is monotone because she's an android (well, gynoid, technically). However, she is _not_ emotionless, making it hilarious when she verbally abuses Roger in a calm, soothing voice.
    
    "You're a _louse_, Roger Smith."
    
-   Sawyer from _Black Lagoon_ talks like this because she uses an artificial voice box to speak as her voice box was damaged.
    -   Revy's a classic example: The moment she stops acting maniacal during a gunfight and acts suddenly calm, **run**.
-   Sosuke Aizen's English voice from _Bleach_; his VA, Kyle Hebert used HAL as an a inspiration.
-   When Lilika in _Burn Up! Scramble_ uses her Psychic Powers, she gets Mind-Control Eyes and speaks like this. Usually, she blurts out something embarrassing about Rio.
-   Clare from _Claymore_ speaks like this to emphasize her stoic badassery.
    -   Priscilla, rather more creepily, after she becomes an Awakened One.
-   _Cowboy Bebop_:
    -   Vincent Volaju of _Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door_.
    -   Vicious.
-   In _Death Note_, L and Near, both brilliant, ruthless detectives with No Social Skills, are both prime examples of this trope.
-   Muzan Kibutsuji from _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_. He almost always speaks in a soft-sounding monotone, which makes him pretty unsettling whenever he's butchering someone.
-   _Digimon Frontier's_ Dark Trailmon. He's actually very HAL-inspired, in design and in voice. (Ironically, he's not _evil,_ just creepy: you expect the Dark Trailmon that you meet in the Dark Terminal during a hallucination caused by Duskmon, the Warrior of Darkness, after he ambushed you and kicked your butt on the Dark Continent to be a little... dark.)
    -   Prior to that, _Adventure_ had Machinedramon, who _was_ dark.
    -   Many Nightmares from _Digimon Tamers_ came from J-Reaper, who was even darker.
-   The Androids from _Dragon Ball_ are supposed to be a Machine Monotone variety, although Android 8 uses a _little_ more inflection than most, and (in English), 17 and 18 can get pretty emotive depending on situational context. 13 is an aversion, because he’s outrageously boisterous to _begin with_.
-   Yuki Nagato from the _Haruhi Suzumiya_ speaks in a monotone, though she's not really that creepy, especially when compared to Ryoko Asakura.
-   Given that she's an Emotionless Girl that drags people down to hell, Ai of _Hell Girl_ always speaks like this. The times when she doesn't is normally a time that you're REALLY screwed.
-   In _Higurashi: When They Cry_, speaking in this tends to show up in the main cast whenever things about the Town with a Dark Secret or Oyashiro-sama's curse start getting unearthed. More specifically, those under the influence of Hinamizawa Syndrome start _imagining_ the people around them doing this, compounding their paranoia.
-   Shigure of _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_ has No Social Skills due to a really awful upbringing (her own father _never bothered to name her_; a friend of his finally did so when she was around 10), and what little dialogue she delivers is typically extremely flat. She, however, is distinctly not The Stoic; she just expresses her feelings with her body language and her actions.
-   Paul von Oberstein from _Legend of the Galactic Heroes_ has a trademark monotone and is one of the grey characters of the series. While he has thrown his lot in with Reinhard, he also has his own goals and apparently has little need for the fellowship of the other admirals. His actions lead to the death of Siegfried Kircheis, Reinhard's closest friend in an assassination targeting Reinhard. He is also a participant in the events that lead to Oscar von Reuental's rebellion, although he later exhibits something, not unlike sympathy.
-   Sucy Manbavaran in _Little Witch Academia_ speaks in a morose and raspy monotone, which adds to her generally unsettling nature.
-   Precia Testarossa from _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_ is a monotone speaker and just a wee bit nuts on top of it.
-   Johan Liebert from _Monster_ constantly speaks in a calm, quiet monotone as part of his Dissonant Serenity. Anyone who hears it will likely end up dead.
-   _Naruto_
    -   Shino Aburame. (when he talks, anyway.) Somehow, this makes him even creepier than being a living hive for 4 million insects would by itself.
    -   Gaara would fit this. Even after his Heel–Face Turn, he still retains his gruff-yet-emotionless monotone way of speaking. Old habits die hard, it seems.
    -   And Itachi Uchiha, whose voice, though not quite a monotone, stays very even whether he's chatting with his partner or predicting your death.
-   Rei Ayanami from _Neon Genesis Evangelion_. She's practically the poster child for this trope when she does talk. Though she still has noticed subtle changes in tone if you pay attention. So it's not completely monotonic, actually. The Creepiness is up to the viewer to behold.
-   In the last OVA, after being possessed by an evil doll spirit, Akane from _Ranma ½_ starts talking in a low monotone voice, even while Showing Off the New Body.

-   _Sgt. Frog_: Kululu, who gets inexplicably high pitched when he gets particularly excited about something (usually terrible or destructive), which actually makes him even creepier.
    -   There's also the Keronian resonance ritual, which acts as a bonding ritual of camaraderie between fellow countrymen far from home, but to anyone else it sounds like a satanic cult initiation...
-   Dr. Stein the Mad Scientist in _Soul Eater_ speaks in this in the English dub. He keeps on doing it even after turning out to be a Stealth Mentor.
    -   Crona does this using this as a normal tone of voice. His/her voice becomes sing-song and insane when his mind is snapped by Medusa, complete with a Slasher Smile and Laughing Madness.
-   Death Gun/Sterben from _Sword Art Online_. Due to his mask filtering out his voice, it appears almost completely drained of emotion. His icy tone gives a haunting quality to all his lines promising to kill someone.
-   The Anti-Spiral leader in _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_, and Nia when she's changed into an Anti-Spiral. Once the protagonists get the better of him, he snaps and starts getting Hot-Blooded.
-   Legato Bluesummers of _Trigun_ almost always spoke with a monotone (or simply very calm) voice.
    -   And then you find out that his English voice is _Kenshin Himura_ of all people...
    -   Subverted in the manga: after being crippled by Knives for trying to kill Vash, he turns Axe-Crazy, but still talks with the creepy monotone.
-   Nerabu in _Tweeny Witches_ maintains a level tone in all situations.
-   _Vamp!_ has the character of Shizune, who is notorious for speaking with one of these.
-   Both of Aiko's parents in _Vampire Princess Miyu_ speak in very flat, unemotional voices and have very slow speech patterns; this makes them sound _horribly_ creepy, even when they seem to be very kind persons aside of this "detail". This _very_ subtly hints that they are actually Dead All Along.
    -   Miyu's father also speaks similarly in the flashbacks, which complements his totally emotionless personality quite well. This is because, after Miyu's mother bit him, he became an Empty Shell.
-   From _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_, Judai does this when he is taken over by the Supreme King/Haou. Well, in the Japanese version at least. The English Dub puts a reverberation in his voice.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V_ gives us Yuya's "Awakening". Half of the time he's screaming in rage. The other half is a monotone that says "die".

    Comic Books 

-   _The Avengers:_ In his early days, the Vision was noted to speak with no emotional inflection regardless of what he was saying, even when it should've been typically bombastic Silver Age dialogue, and even the other Avengers acknowledge it's a little unsettling (represented by his speaking in _italicised_ fonts).
-   Rorschach from _Watchmen_ speaks in a low, growly monotone (other characters remark on its unsettling quality) with odd, near-Hulk Speak clipped sentences. "Yes. Good night. Remember it often." He has flashes of eloquence, too, which are unnervingly at odds with this style of delivery.
    -   His mode of speaking is shown by his unique speech bubbles, with no words ever **bolded** or _italicised_ for emphasis like the other characters'. By contrast, his speech bubbles in flashbacks to before the Blaire Roche case indicate a totally normal voice.

    Fan Works 

-   _Bird_ features Charnel, who talks very calmly and evenly, and whom Taylor tends to find soothing. Then there is Mimi who can default to thus when under the influence of her power, described by Taylor as 'robotic'.
-   The robotic clones in _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_.
-   In _Ghosts of the Past_, sequel of _Child of the Storm_, Maddie seems to have this, as part of her Emotionless Girl and Living Weapon shtick. She picked it up from her boss, Nathaniel Essex, who is described as very rarely showing emotion. Notably, as her Heel–Face Turn progresses, she starts doing this less and less.
    -   Her cousin, Harry, also starts doing this when he's on the far side of Tranquil Fury. It's generally a sign that things are getting very, very bad.
-   Fiona from _Kira Is Justice_.
-   _Tales of the Undiscovered Swords_: Sasanoyuki, in keeping with his Emotionless Boy personality.
-   In _The Very Secret Diary_, based on Ginny's story in _Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_, Ginny has this voice while possessed, and it starts to bleed into her conscious voice.
-   Rarity in _Pages Of Harmony_ after Twilight Mind Rapes her into being devoid of emotion to take Generosity.
-   _Advice and Trust_: Rei's monotone voice is the result of being drugged to the gills on tranquilizers and mood suppressors. When she starts talking like this again after a long stretch of being more emotionally demonstrative than usual, Shinji and Asuka immediately realize that something is very wrong.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide_: Rei's voice is this. Her monotone voice unnerves Shinji because it reminds him of the death of the former Rei.
-   In _The Loud House_ fanfiction _The Nightmare House_, Lori's nightmare involves her siblings saying, "We don't need you" in a monotone voice similar to Lucy's.
-   The Puppet speaks like in _Something Always Remains_.
    -   Later on, Vesper Belrose does as well. Considering she merged with the Puppet after her death, she adopted its robotic speak and speech patterns.
-   Downplayed with Carlos in _All Mixed Up!_, whose voice is noted to sound like a haunting and depressed version of Lord Rectangle's voice. It's fitting for him though, since he thinks he's been long forgotten by Odd Squad.

    Films — Animated 

-   In _Despicable Me 2_, Agnes is working on a speech to give to her future Mommy whenever Gru finally finds someone to marry, and when she recites it she speaks in absolutely flat monotone almost like a text-to-speech program.
    
    **Gru:** \[_Trying to look impressed, instead of horrified_\] Wow! That—was...something _else_! I _really_ liked the way you _smiled_ at the end—? Let's try this _one_ more time, but a _teensy bit_ less...like—a _zombie_, o-_kay_...?
    
-   In _Happy Feet_, there is a minor penguin character who sounds like a dead ringer for Hal 9000. He even calls main character Mumble "Dave".
-   Owlman in _Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths_ (voiced by James Woods) speaks in a calm, collected, and calculating manner which makes him quite creepy. Frequently a source of horror given what his character is like.
-   Andy gives us this lovely line in _Toy Story 2_: "I don't want to play with you anymore." It causes Woody to wake up screaming from the nightmare.
-   AUTO from _Wall E_, who was based on HAL 9000. (Helps that, at least in English, it's actually spoken by a computer.)

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Men in Black_, the bug in the Edgar suit demands sugar water from Edgar's wife. OK, so his creepy monotone is very gruff and hostile-sounding, but that basically matches Edgar's pre-bug personality as well.
-   Any and all characters in _Sin City_, including the heroes, have an extremely dry and calm manner of speaking, bordering on creepy monotone. This is exemplified with Marv, who always speaks in a soft, calm manner, bordering on the nonchalant, even when brutally torturing and murdering somebody. Roark Jr, before his run-in with Hartigan, speaks almost like HAL. After that, though, he's a lot more expressive.
-   HAL 9000 of _2001: A Space Odyssey_ speaks in an eerily calm and soothing voice, though he occasionally displays some emotions: prideful and even apologetic and, at the last, fearful, making him the most developed character in the film.
-   Uncle Charlie from _Shadow of a Doubt_
-   Bruno Anthony from _Strangers on a Train_
-   Hannibal Lecter from the _Hannibal Lecter_ film series (_The Silence of the Lambs_, _Hannibal_, and _Red Dragon_). Anthony Hopkins based his performance on HAL 9000.
-   Travis Bickle from _Taxi Driver_ often does this, especially when narrating.
-   Reverend Harry Powell from _The Night of the Hunter_.
-   Patrick Bateman from _American Psycho_.
-   Jonathan Crane in _Batman Begins_ is this after he's been given a massive dose of his own fear toxin and Batman, who's already kind of intimidating, is interrogating him.
-   After Selina Kyle is almost killed by her boss Max Shreck in _Batman Returns_ for knowing too much, she repeats the same words that she said upon entering her apartment in a previous scene, only in a creepy monotone of the first variety: "Honey, I'm home. Oh, I forgot. I'm not married." This turns out to be a prelude to Selina's impending Freak Out and transformation into Catwoman later in the scene.
-   Bart, a rogue cop in _Southland Tales_ flatly insists on tagging along to a (fake) domestic disturbance with Taverner and Santaros and executes the couple on arrival. A creepy monotone delivered by Jon Lovitz is surprisingly unnerving.
-   _It Came from Outer Space_ (1953). The aliens who've copied human forms talk this way, severely flipping out the real humans who don't believe their repeated claims that they don't mean any harm.
    -   Not just monotone; these voices are like someone speaking inside a box; unnerving in the street or at home.
-   _28 Days Later_ has a variation, where a drugged Hannah is monotonously scaring the soldiers by telling them how Jim is killing them all.
-   _Full Metal Jacket_: "Seven. Six. Two. Millimeter... Full... metal... jacket..."
-   _No Country for Old Men_: Anton Chigurh speaks in a flat, emotionless manner, making him all the more scarier.
-   Dr. Manhattan in _Watchmen_. In one scene, Ozymandias remarks that he knew that Manhattan still had feelings; they were just too subtle for others to notice. He uses this to his advantage.
-   John Malkovich's character in the 2000 TV miniseries of _Les Misérables_, perhaps as a result of trying to avoid any accent as he is not talking in his mother language.
-   The citizens of Sandford in _Hot Fuzz_ do this after Nick Angel exposes their dark secret.
-   The evil townspeople of "Nilbog" also do this in _Troll 2_ while trying to force the protagonist to eat a poisoned bowl of ice cream and, in the process, prove that even a creepy synchronized monotone can turn into hilarious narm (or maybe even disturbing kink) with the right line:
    
    "Open your mouth, my little friend! Please, open it!"
    
-   Raven in _Cecil B. Demented_ somehow manages to combine this with Perky Goth to great effect.
-   The robot GERTY in _Moon_ is voiced by a very monotone-sounding Kevin Spacey. In the end, the trope is subverted as GERTY turns out to be mostly benevolent, going so far as to perform a Heroic Sacrifice.
-   Cameron Vale in _Scanners_.
-   "Max", the AI of the spaceship from _Flight of the Navigator_, speaks in a dull, robotic monotone at first. Then, after doing a scan of David's brain, abandons this trope when he accidentally picks up some human personality traits and starts sounding like a robotic Pee-Wee Herman (naturally, as Max is voiced by Paul Reubens).
-   Would-be presidential assassin Mitch Leary from _In the Line of Fire_.
-   Sy Parrish in _One Hour Photo_ spends the majority of the film talking in a very soft-spoken, almost robotic monotone, reflecting his disturbing lack of a personality, although he does show emotion at times, especially near the end of the film when he starts to lose it.
-   The aliens in the first _Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)_, when no real humans were around to fool. Such as "I put the pod in the baby's crib. Soon there will be no more crying."
-   The nameless narrator in _Fight Club_ sometimes slips into this, both in his narration and his dialogue in the film.
-   Interestingly, Darth Vader talks like this in the first Hungarian dubbing of _The Empire Strikes Back_, even keeping up the emotionless tone during his dramatic confrontation with Luke. Nostalgic fans often cite this as their favorite Vader voice, but others claim it came off more as "reading a script" than "acting".
    -   Much later, Supreme Leader Snoke from _The Force Awakens_ is introduced with a low and malevolent voice, coupled with a deep echo for extra chills. Physically his appearance looks ancient with a tone that can go from sinister calm to bellowing frustration within a split second.
-   _Star Trek Into Darkness_ has the subdued John Harrison as its villain, employing a monotone which barely shows any emotion (other than anger). It's a contrast with the hammy Nero from the previous movie, and Ricardo Montalban's original incarnation of the character.
-   _X-Men: Apocalypse_: This is how Apocalypse sounds when he informs Professor X, "I'm here for you, Charles." The voice is quite chilling, and it forebodes that Xavier will soon be in _really deep trouble_.
-   J. Robert Oppenheimer's "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds" dialogue concerning the creation of the atom bomb comes off as this partly because he was saying it for the non-dramatic documentary _The Decision to Drop the Bomb_ and partly because of the grim subject matter.
-   The Zec from _Jack Reacher_.
-   The titular protagonist in _Lucy_, after gaining superhuman mental abilities, speaks in a matter-of-fact monotone, whether discussing human biology with Morgan Freeman or torturing a drug kingpin.
-   The Caller in _Phone Booth_ rarely speaks in anything but a casual, matter-of-fact voice while he holds a man hostage with a sniper rifle. The fact that it's Kiefer Sutherland speaking adds to the effect.
-   The Oompa-Loompas sing like this in _Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory_.
-   Dr. Phillip Decker from _Nightbreed_. Decker speaks in a calm, low, monotone register. He makes it seem like he does it because he wants to soothe his patients. He's in fact an unempathetic, murderous psychopath.
-   _Shrooms_: _(Axe to the head)_ "I love you, Jake".

    Literature 

-   In the _Discworld_ novel _Hogfather_, Mr. Jonathan Teatime — a rogue, sociopathic Psycho for Hire — unnerves people with his creepy monotone. It's one of the signs that he doesn't really see people as _people_ worth communicating with, another being his habit of gratuitously murdering them.
-   In _Five Go to Smuggler's Top_, the allegedly deaf servant Block speaks in a monotone, and also has an expressionless face.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   The Big Bad Lord Voldemort speaks in a calm, flat tone of voice; this, perhaps even more than his use of Soul Jars and his utter lack of compassion, makes him terrifying. Except for when he gets agitated. It comes across more like him trying to achieve this trope but failing every now and again.
    -   As Crouch Jr. proves, people who have drunk Veritaserum (Truth Serum) also speak like this.
-   The demon from the Neil Gaiman short story "Other People" speaks in "a voice that carried with it no sorrow, no relish, only a dreadful flat resignation." It is utterly expressionless for the whole story.
    
    **Narrator:** That's inhuman.  
    **Demon:** Yes.
    

-   In _The Stormlight Archive_, the man whom Lift calls Darkness has a calm, flat voice to match his completely emotionless demeanour, even while he's trying to lynch a young child. He turns out to be Nale, the Herald of Justice, a Time Abyss who's spent the last 4500 years Walking the Earth slowly going insane because it was _better_ than the hellish duties of the Heralds. No wonder Lift doesn't think he's even human.
-   _The Wheel of Time_:
    -   Myrddraal have voices that sound like crumbling bone and are utterly devoid of emotion or inflection. Not only is this incredibly creepy, but it makes Shaidar Haran, the Mouth of Sauron for the Dark One, even _more_ disturbing by comparison.
    -   In the last book, the Sharan accent is described in this vein; a Sharan Ayyad who is part of Demandred's army is described as sounding like "all the music was gone from her voice."
    -   Rand lapses into this in _The Gathering Storm_ after he crosses the Despair Event Horizon. Before he recovers, his voice is flat, mild, and skin-crawlingly terrifying to everyone around him.
-   Ax-Crazy valet Brinkley from P. G. Wodehouse's _Thank You, Jeeves_, though, like everything in the book, it's Played for Laughs.
    
    _Brinkley was at the door, begging me to come out and let him ascertain the colour of my insides; and by Jove, what seemed to me to add the final touch to the whole unpleasantness was that he spoke in the same respectful voice he always used. Kept calling me 'Sir,' too, which struck me as dashed silly. I mean, if you're asking a fellow to come out of a room so that you can dismember him with a carving knife, it's absurd to tack a 'Sir' on to every sentence. The two things don't go together._
    
-   In _Murderess_, James, the boy from Chopped Tree Inn, talks like this when _welcoming_ Lu. His mother quickly sends him away when he scares Lu too much.
-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire_, Lord Roose Bolton, being a devoutly stoic Soft-Spoken Sadist, always speaks in whispers so faint that people have to lean close to hear him. His tone is constantly described as unsettling, emotionless and cold, as he believes that avoiding passion is the key to staying young.
-   _Temeraire_: When Temeraire meets his old enemy Lien in _Black Powder War_, she delivers an eloquent, chilling description of everything he's cost her and how utterly she plans to destroy him in Revenge, all in a flat, emotionless monotone. Temeraire is badly shaken when she finally leaves.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Breaking Bad_ and _Better Call Saul_: Gustavo Fring is a lethal guy to lock horns with, but he talks with the most creepy yoga-like serenity. Gus becomes more menacing whenever he _does_ raise his voice.
-   _Black Bird_: Larry Hall is a serial killer and pedophile who constantly speaks in a flat, emotionless affect.
-   In _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, Dark Willow, when she snaps at the end of season 6 and goes on her Roaring Rampage of Revenge (or would it be "Creepy Monotonous" Rampage of Revenge?): "Bored now."
    -   What makes it even creepier is that the monotonous "Bored now" is the exact line used by an alternate version of Willow wherein she was an evil badass vampire chick. Dark Willow was basically her vampire double sans the vampire.
-   _Daredevil (2015)_:
    -   James Wesley speaks in a very flat monotonous tone, which combined with his glasses makes him very intimidating as a mouthpiece for Fisk.
    -   Wilson Fisk is no sloucher either in this department when he's giving long-winded soliloquys.
    -   Dex whenever he attempts to feign empathy with some sort of variation of "It's hard, it's really hard".
-   _Deadliest Warrior_ gives us Brahm Galligher, who seems to be incapable of speaking in anything _but_ a creepy monotone. Unless he's swinging a halberd around.
-   _Dexter_:
    -   Subverted. Half the fun of most dialogues the title character takes part in resides in the way Michael C. Hall delivers his lines, in an emotionless creepy monotone that should trigger the "serial killer alarm" in the minds of even the most oblivious of the other characters. Except, of course, it never does. "Why, in a building full of cops - all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul - is Doakes the only one that gets the creeps from me?"
        -   Inverted when he snaps and kills the used car salesman for insulting Rita. Cue scared "he's freaking crazy!" reaction.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Daleks use a mechanical, staccato voice delivery, but they tend to increase both speed and volume for emphasis. Also, there's quite a bit of variation of individual voices. Creepy, yes; intensely emotional, and very monotone — only the single tone used isn't flat apathy, but rather a consistent bent of shrieking hysterical rage. When they're not grating out staccato bursts of antipathy, it usually means something's very, very wrong.
    -   The Cybermen from "The Moonbase" onwards speak in a flat, mechanical tone of voice in the '60s, the '70s (i.e. "Revenge of the Cybermen"), and the Revival Series. In "The Tenth Planet", they spoke in a creepy emotionless sing-song modelled on early 'singing computers' like IBM 7094, while in the '80s, they spoke in a projected shout similar to that of the Daleks (though deeper and more drawn out).
    -   The sociopathic and terrifying Himmler-Expy Nyder in "Genesis of the Daleks" has this as his affect. He's remembered as one of the scariest supporting characters in the story because of this, even next to Davros and the Daleks.
    -   The robots in "The Robots of Death" — one of the many reasons they invoke the Uncanny Valley In-Universe. The sequel _Corpse Marker_ establishes that this monotone has become fashionable for humans to affect, especially those of upper classes.
    -   The creepiness in "The Impossible Planet" consists mostly of the creepy monotone of the Ood and the computer system being possessed by Satan.
    -   "Human Nature"/"The Family of Blood": The Family of Blood sported eerie monotones for a little while after they started inhabiting human bodies... and then all four of them went stark raving mad.
    -   Used to great effect in "Silence in the Library", where an AI retelling cries of panic and pain in utterly emotionless creepy monotone makes the situation seem scarier than it would be if they were reproduced verbatim.
    -   "Resolution": When controlled by the Dalek, Lin speaks like this.
-   In the _Firefly_ episode "Objects in Space", River announces to the bounty hunter Jubal Early that she has "melted away" into the ship _Serenity_, becoming part of it, in a creepy monotone. It becomes even more chilling when she alters her tone just a tiny bit for the line
    
    "Not talking to River. You're talking to _Serenity_. And Early? _Serenity_ is _very unhappy._"
    
-   The Observer in _Fringe_. On first seeing him, this trope leads the viewer to believe that he's got something devious going on, but he turns out to be more ambiguous than that.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Peter Baelish always speaks in a smarmy, wry half-whisper. Not too creepy and even somewhat affable when he simply converses with his peers, but he uses the same tone when describing the things he did to poor women who displeased him, or telling a helpless girl, that she's totally safe with him.
    -   One of the prisoners at Harrenhal speaks this way in "Garden of Bones" when explaining that her entire family has recently been tortured to death.
    -   Styr the Magnar pairs this with a guttural voice and a Softspoken Sadist to breed a great Obviously Evil voice.
-   Sylar from _Heroes_ could _possibly_ pass for a perfectly ordinary, non Serial Killer type, except that he seems capable only of a creepy monotone or murderous rage. No middle ground.
    
    **Sylar:** This is usually the part where people start screaming.
    
-   _The Late Show with Stephen Colbert_ had a segment where Stephen started talking in clipped, unsettling tones about The Formula (Which was, in fact, baby formula but he thought it sounded weirdly sinister), and it's becoming a running gag when stories lend themselves to demanding The Elixir from an emperor's tomb or a self-described Unstoppable Apparatus.
-   _Lost_ gives us Benjamin Linus. "Of course, if I was one of them, these people that you just assume are your enemies, what would I do? There would be no balloon so I would draw them out to a really secluded place, like a cave or some underbrush, a good place for a trap... an ambush. And when your friends got there a bunch of my people would be waiting for them. Then they would use them to trade for me. I guess it's a good thing I'm not one of them, huh? ...You guys got any milk?"

-   _The Outer Limits (1995)_: In "Family Values", Gideon typically speaks in one, though he does occasionally vary his tone when expressing anger.
-   This is one of the reasons Mesogog, from _Power Rangers: Dino Thunder_, is one of the scariest villains in the _Power Rangers_ franchise. He never raises his voice at all. Even when expressing extreme anger, frustration or threats, he stays completely calm. Since he is a half human/half dinosaur hybrid, he combines this trope with Snake Talk, which makes him even more creepy.
-   _Red Dwarf:_ In the episode "Quarantine", Rimmer maintains an entirely level monotone while asking the others if they think there might perhaps be something... amiss with his behaviour. After he's mentioned he's been watching them argue, entirely silent, for two (maybe three) hours.
    
    **Rimmer:** I'm sitting here in a red and white-striped gingham dress... and army boots. You think there's nothing amiss?
    
-   Lucius Vorenus from _Rome_, while in the middle of a Heroic BSoD. Even for a man who is normally quite reserved and has little problem with legally sanctioning killing, uttering the same line over and over while covered in blood can get rather creepy.
    
    **Lucius:** Where are my children?
    
-   One _Saturday Night Live_ sketch featured sincere and heartfelt testimonials for The Amazing Alexander, a Broadway hypnotist act.
-   The Borg from _Star Trek_ speak like this, along with Voice of the Legion. Individual Borg that have been separated from the Hive Mind also start off with a creepy monotone, though as they develop their own personalities, they usually segue into Deadpan Snarker or Spock Speak.
    -   Award for creepiest borg monotone goes to Locutus' line: "Your resistance is hopeless... Number One."
        -   Almost everything Locutus said was terrifying.
        -   It's worth noting that Picard used the Locutus monotone while interrogating the liberated drone Hugh, who recognized Picard as Locutus.
    -   Lt. Commander Data also qualifies for this trope. There are situations where, combined with his natural Dissonant Serenity, Data's calm demeanor can be downright nightmarish.
        -   Data spends most of "Masks" being a Large Ham after a number of alien personalities take over his body. Before Data or anyone else understands what is happening to him, however, he calmly asks LaForge a chilling question in a haunting monotone:
            
            **Data**: Geordi? What does it feel like when a person is losing his mind?
            
-   Summer Glau is good at creepy in general. In _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_, Cameron regularly speaks in a constant, soft-yet-creepy monotone. However, the show also plays its _absence_ to excellent effect. The absence of the creepy monotone we're used to is what made the scene where Cameron recites not only word for word, but also inflection for inflection a "classmate's" emotional bathroom rant for the principal creepy.
-   _Ultra Series_:
    
    -   _Ultraman_: Ultraman himself when he and Hayata first met - he has an odd echo to his voice, and this appears to be his speaking voice rather than telepathic inter-alien communication.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   _Ultraman Z_: Kaburagi speaks like this when possessed by Celebro, with an added reverb effect to his voice for maximum creepiness. He slowly loses this trait as the series goes on and Celebro's Mask of Sanity starts cracking, revealing the raving psychopath beneath.
    
    **Kaburagi**: _Kiete karekareta._ (I'm feeling good.)
    
    -   Fitting for a modern retelling of _Ultraman_, every Extraterrestrial in _Shin Ultraman_ speaks this way, including Ultraman himself. This serves mainly to emphasise how mysterious and far beyond humanity they are.
-   Robert Stack would often host his segments on _Unsolved Mysteries_ in what was supposed to probably be a very flat, newscaster-type voice. However, the tone of his voice and the creepy nature of the show sent it careening into this pretty quickly.
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   Eugene Victor Tooms from "Squeeze" and "Tooms" bare-ly has an-y in-to-na-tion at all and talks real-ly slow-ly. It's ser-i-ous-ly freak-y.
    -   Donnie Phaster, the Serial Killer in "Irresistible" with a fetish for dead women's hair, has a creepy, calm, flat voice and almost never blinks. Somehow, he can get strangers to see him as charming and affable for a short while. He turns out much later to have become or always been a demon.

    Music 

-   Some musicians, like David Byrne and Peter Murphy, are known for frequently employing an affectionless creepy monotone singing voice.
-   "I Want My Innocence Back" by Emilie Autumn has plenty of this.
-   Radiohead:
    -   "Fitter Happier" uses this trope (perfectly monotone as only a computer can be) in addition to _insanely_ creepy lyrics.
    -   _Kid A_ and _Amnesiac_ feature Thom Yorke giving a dry, monotone performance on a number of tracks in order to produce a decidedly detached mood.
-   "Hide and Seek" by Imogen Heap.
-   Nu-Italo (eg. Eiffel 65) songs often used vocoders to this effect.
-   "Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto".
-   "I Tried So Hard to be Good" by The pAper chAse.
-   OK Go's cover of _The Muppet Show_ theme song.
-   Tyler the Creator does this in his song "Fish," which details the thoughts of a man who is either Albert Fish, a cannibalistic, pedophilic, necrophilic Serial Killer and rapist, or someone with an incredibly unhealthy obsession with fish.
-   The female lead singer's vocal performance in The Flying Lizards' cover of The Beatles' "Money (That's What I Want)."
-   Evelyn Evelyn speak like this and often sing like this. Despite being Conjoined Twins they aren't presented as evil or creepy because of it. They, however, had a _very_ horrible childhood and have poor social skills, which likely resulted in them speaking in monotone.
-   The Protomen feature this in Act II's "Give Us The Rope," where the crowd's vocals are toneless shouting, in contrast to the emotional, dramatic music backing them.

    Pinball 

-   Although Zaccaria's _Time Machine_ avoids the Machine Monotone of earlier talking pinball tables, the Scientist's speech is decidedly monotonic and somewhat disturbing.

    Radio 

-   A panel segment on _Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me_ involved a study purporting that women found men speaking in a monotone to be sexy, leading to a hilarious attempt to invoke this from announcer and scorekeeper Carl Kasell:
    -   They also discussed how the inverse of a creepy monotone can be just as off-putting:

    Roleplay 

-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! East Academy_, Marcus uses this during his Breaking Speech to Gretel.

    Tabletop Games 

-   This is one of the suggested options for the voice of Friend Computer in _Paranoia_.
-   On the few occasions in _Warhammer 40,000_ that Necron Lords have spoken, they have been unusually polite and cultured speakers possessed of a truly chilling calm, which may make some sense, given that they are the still-sentient leaders of a race that now exists as, for all intents and purposes, undead robots.
    -   "Lucky creatures... At long last... you have found... the tranquillity... of death..."

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Dangan Ronpa 2 Goodbye Despair_, Mikan Tsukimi dips into this when she's fingered as the killer of chapter 3. This is a _stark_ contrast to her normal method of speaking, meek and full of stuttering.
-   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_:
    -   In Trials and Tribulations, Viola Cadaverini is said to speak with a creepy monotone, laced with subtle _death threats_.
    -   In Dual Destinies, a particular, usually-emotional character has a line with his face turning completely stern, and part of his forehead **torn**, not bleeding. He's The Phantom, a master spy who was just impersonating a deceased detective, whom he had murdered.
        
        Fulbright: "Aw. Look at what you did to my mask."
        
-   In _Spirit Hunter: NG_, what makes Yakumo's dissection of living girls all the more unsettling is how calm he is when doing it, his voice perfectly level and measured.

    Web Animation 

-   _The Music Freaks_: Combined with her being an Eerie Pale-Skinned Brunette, most of Rosemeadow High is afraid of Sadie.
-   In _RWBY_ the Albain Brothers talk very calmly, with soft, purring voices that give off a sinister vibe. Throughout a tense conversation with Blake and Ghira, their tone and modulation barely rise, and they keep the same flat voice while casually discussing informing Adam about Blake's whereabouts. It's one of several reasons Sun finds them creepy. Averted Trope as they attack the Belladonna estate, where they yell like one would expect in the tense situation of a fight.

    Webcomics 

-   _Awful Hospital:_ The Ambiguously Human Dr. Man's voice is described as "cheerfully emotionless", with the particularly eerie quirk that it _never_ changes tone, only volume.
-   _Homestuck_'s Gamzee _possibly_ speaks in monotone; it's hard to be certain exactly how his text quirk would be vocalised. At any rate, he later goes off the deep end, and upscales his wHiMsIcAl CaSe AlTeRnAtIoN to whole lines of text, meaning that he alternates between barely audible and screaming in rage. Aradia also speaks like this.
-   _Kagerou_'s Kano speaks like this, according to the author.
-   Likewise, _Remus_'s Seth Williams apparently speaks like this. even when he's about to carve someone up like a Thanksgiving turkey.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, based on Magus reaction to Ashley's comment and the lighting here, it seems she delivered the line in this voice.

    Web Original 

-   _El Anticristo_ and _Andale Ramiro_, two Hispanic dudes from Youtube who say the most aggressive things about anything via a by-definition-monotonous speech synthesizer, are famous for doing that.
-   SSJ2 Gohan speaks like this in _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_. It's downright terrifying.
-   Gary from _Red vs. Blue_. Voiced by _Microsoft Sam._
-   Nacht from the Whateley Universe. A number of other students at Whateley Academy are utterly terrified of her.
-   The hovercat from _Water-Human_. Like Gary above, he's voiced by Microsoft Sam.
-   There are various internet CGI cartoons featuring anthropomorphic pig-things speaking with monotone voices.
-   In _Noob_, Ystos sometimes speaks like this when using his assassin avatar.
-   Melissa Hunter's portrayal of Wednesday Addams in _Adult Wednesday Addams_ is based on the Christina Ricci version and speaks in the same kind of monotone that Ricci did in the films.

    Western Animation 

-   _DC Animated Universe_:
    -   In _Batman: The Animated Series_, Mr. Freeze never really deviates from his cold, chilling (no pun intended) monotone, providing juxtaposition to the emotional depth of the character. It's quite effective. Word of God has it that his voice actor, Michael Ansara, struggled with this element of the role — his instinct was to _act_, and he had to be constantly reminded to be flat and robotic. Especially creepy in the _Batman Beyond_ episode "Meltdown", in which he stops being simply apathetic and starts being straight up merciless.
    -   Terminal, a one-shot _Batman Beyond_ villain, is another good one. This from the man (Michael Rosenbaum) who went on to play the Flash. It's especially creepy considering how Terminal is the leader of a gang of Jokerz. "You're not laughing. He's not laughing."
    -   The Joker _himself_ in much of _Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker_. Less laughing, more menacing.
    -   Jeffrey Combs as both the Scarecrow in _Batman: The Animated Series_ and the Question in _Justice League_. The difference being that Scarecrow's is creepy and Question's was hilarious.
        
        **Question:** _\[singing\]_ Fell in love again. What am I gonna tell my friends?
        
    -   Question's speech to Luthor in "Question Authority" falls right into this trope, however, being disturbingly calm.
    -   Braniac in _Superman: The Animated Series_ and _Justice League_.
-   _Dilbert_: The smartest garbageman in the world. He also has access to all kinds of equipment no garbageman should possess.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   In "Treehouse of Horror IV", Bart is turned into a vampire. He rejoins the family and monotones, "Hello, mother. Hello, father. I missed you during my uneventful absence."
    -   "Treehouse of Horror V" has anyone who's been "re-Neducated", the final phase of which consists of people getting a total frontal lobotomy.
        
        **Bart & Lisa:** Joiiin us, fatheeer.  
        **Marge:** It's _bliiiiiiiis_.
        
    -   Also used in "The PTA Disbands", coupled with Troubling Unchildlike Behavior.
        
        **Marge:** There's just something about flying a kite at night that's so... unwholesome!  
        **Bart:** _\[looks up to his parent's window over his shoulder\]_ Hello, mother dear...
        
    -   In "Bart on the Road", Lisa has to tell Homer that Bart had rented a car with a fake ID and was trapped in Tennessee. Homer's face goes red and he says calmly, "Yes. That's a real pickle. Would you excuse me?" He puts on a radiation helmet and screams incoherently for a while, causing the faceplate of the helmet to fog up. He then takes it off and says, now using the monotone again, "Alright, I have thought this through. I will send Bart the money to fly home. Then I will murder him."
-   Raven from _Teen Titans (2003)_.
    -   The Brain also speaks in a rather creepy, electronic one.
    -   Slade also speaks in an eerily calm voice.
        -   Slade is played by Ron Perlman, who used the exact same monotone when narrating as Fire Lord Sozin from _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ in "The Avatar and the Fire Lord".
-   _Animaniacs_: Yakko and Dot slip in and out of this after getting whisked off to the middle of nowhere by the Grim Reaper.
    
    **Yakko:** We accept.  
    **Dot:** To accept is to yield.  
    **Yakko:** To yield is to allow oncoming traffic the right of way.  
    **Dot:** Your breath is like the breeze of a landfill.  
    **Yakko:** Food particles are wedged between your teeth.
    
-   Ignignokt, the green mooninite from _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_.
-   Ultron in _The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes_. Not helping is that he can't change his expressions, and his head is designed to look like an ant. Even worse, before he turns evil, he speaks in a much more emotional and upbeat fashion, meaning this is most likely intentional on his part.
-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_:
    -   The Delightful Children from Down the Lane play with this trope - while sometimes, they speak in monotone, they also can have emotional responses, such as anger and frustration, etc. However, they all speak at the same time.
    -   Lampshaded and subverted with _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_'s Billy in the crossover special, in which he can't seem to keep up with them.
    -   The episode "Operation: D.A.T.E" has the Delightful Children using a Mind-Control Device on a lot of kids they invited to a party in their mansion. As a result, they get Mind-Control Eyes and keep saying "Join us..." in a monotone sounding voice.
    -   The Interesting Twins From Beneath The Lane also speak in monotones, but they behave much more individually although they are Finishing Each Other's Sentences.
    -   Minor villains Mr. Wink and Mr. Fibb speak in monotone. Though they do show emotion sometimes.
-   Her flat-tone delivery is most likely one of the reasons why _Daria_ is so unpopular in school. The audience usually finds it endearing, but to most other people, she's "the freaky quiet girl".
-   In _The Fairly OddParents!_, HP and Sanderson speak in such boring monotones that their voices are very low and deep. Even their Evil Laugh is dull and without affect.
-   _Futurama_:
    -   Played for Laughs with the Hypnotoad. Anyone it hypnotizes speaks with no inflection, simply praising glory to the Hypnotoad.
    -   Parodied in "Raging Bender", when Hermes comes back from vacation with a green slug on his head and explains in a creepy monotone that they had to make an emergency stop on the Brain Slug Planet. Throughout the episode, he tries to trick the others into wearing brain slugs.

-   Amon in _The Legend of Korra_. Scary enough on his own, but combine his creepy monotone with voice actor Steve Blum using his scariest voice...
    -   Even worse when you throw the mask into the equation and never know what he looks like until the season 1 finale.
-   Dr. Barber from _The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack_ speaks in a monotone all the time, mmmmmm, yes.
-   While everyone might want to forget _Mega Man (Ruby-Spears)_'s "Curse of the Lion Men", it does fit here. After Tar flash-reprograms Wily's robots and Roll, Protoman _very flatly_ tells him that he's now their leader. Made even more unsettling since no one else being mind-controlled during that episode invoked this trope (except perhaps Roll).
    -   Earlier than that, Mega Man's voice becomes flat (along with a Brief Accent Imitation) when he was under Wily's control.
-   The Regis Mark V in _Megas XLR_ speaks exclusively with a rapidly-delivered but completely neutral tone of voice. It makes sense as it's a robot, but the way it says it makes it sound like assimilating everything non-organic into itself is as natural to it as breathing is to a human.
-   Baudelaire says that Maxwell Madison Jr. from _Phantom 2040_ speaks this way as well.
-   The Twins from _Superjail!_ speak in a low, quiet, gentle monotone voice - a stark contrast to the Warden's loud, flamboyant, inflected way of speaking.
-   Shockwave of _Transformers: Animated._ He even gives a Shout-Out to HAL 9000, saying "I'm afraid I can't let you do that" to Ratchet. Though in his disguise as Longarm, he talks normally.
    -   The same show's version of Megatron has this to a lesser degree. Amusingly, he once modified his voice to impersonate Bulkhead, but kept the monotone.
-   The _Transformers: Prime_ incarnation of Shockwave also very rarely emotes, which fits into his occupation quite well. Even on the rare occasions he's angry it barely rises above the monotone, which combined with his face just makes him even _creepier_.
-   In _Wakfu_, Rushu is normally a hammy villain. When he is forced to revert to his true form while fighting Goultard, he briefly slips into a cold monotone, the implication being that he's not really having fun anymore.
-   Tino from _The Weekenders_ started talking like this when he was made fun of for crying during a showing of _Romeo and Juliet_, so he decided to become emotionless.
-   The Emily clone in _World of Tomorrow_ speaks in a monotone voice, claiming to have almost no emotions due to Clone Degeneration.
-   King Ramses talks like this on _Courage the Cowardly Dog_.

    Real Life 

-   Not all languages have the same range of inflection, resulting in speakers of a language with a lower range when learning a new language with a bigger range (for example Dutch speakers learning English), tend to sound monotone.
-   A bit of Truth in Television: behold flat affect, a common symptom of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and the psychotic disorders (which includes schizophrenia). Some autistic people and people with aphasia also don't display emotion "appropriately"—that is, in ways similar to the majority—despite feeling it deeply, because they simply don't know how or it doesn't feel natural to them.

-   Stephen Hawking spoke like this, though it was because of the synthesizer he had to use to speak _at all_. He was actually quite personable. His lectures certainly drew crowds.
    -   It's not just Hawking. Anyone who speaks using an artificial voicebox has no choice but to use a monotone, as the mechanism doesn't allow for inflection and tone. (For reference see Ned Gerblansky on _South Park_, or any number of laryngectomy patients in anti-smoking public service announcements.) Later, Hawking was offered improved software that could affect tone better and use a more appropriate accent; he turned it down because the synthesiser is recognised as being his voice.
-   Christopher Walken may be the best example of this trope, so much that even Wikipedia acknowledges it!

-   David Tanny uses a voice for his songs and podcasts that is basically a cheerful monotone. Especially unsettling when what he sings about contains Squick, as it frequently does.
-   Carl Sagan sounded like Agent Smith before sounding like Agent Smith was cool.
-   Used by Robin Williams to show one of the ways you can find out if your neighbors have been taken over by aliens.
-   In an interview, Alfred Hitchcock explained that raving lunatics are not scary. He said it was the dead calm voice you can't reason with. He made a finger gun gesture and said in a deadly calm voice "I don't want to do this, because my mother always said you shouldn't hurt people." Very creepy.

-   For some reason, Japanese PA announcers, regardless of who they are, seemed to be trained to be as monotone as possible.

-   Alan Rickman was fond of this, often playing sinister characters who combined such a delivery style with Cold Ham, Dramatic Pause, and Evil Sounds Deep.
