_"Monty Python. Where are they now? Well, they're here in this cupboard."_  
_\[Opens cupboard; they are in fact inside\]_  
_\[Closes cupboard\]_  
_"...Sad, isn't it?"_

A kind of epilogue where we're shown what happens to the characters, places, and/or the setting after the series. It usually gets about a minute or two during the last extended credits of a Grand Finale, or a less intrusive version of the closing credits may roll over it.

A staple of the Very Loosely Based on a True Story films, it differs from a Distant Finale in that we get little flashes (such as photographs, still frames, little captions, narration/voiceover, or a Montage of individual clips) that tell us what happened to the characters, instead of a full scene with dialogue or character interaction. If it shows how each character meets his maker, a Deadly Distant Finale. Can be used to create a Fast-Forward to Reunion. If it happens while the credits are rolling, it might overlap with Creative Closing Credits. In video games, this may be done in the form of a dynamic Modular Epilogue. For works Based on a True Story, this often overlaps with Real-Person Epilogue where the real inspiration for the fictional character is shown. Might overlap with Right Now Montage, when it shows Slice of Life scenes. How We Got Here is the exact opposite of this trope.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

-   _For Better or for Worse_ ended its 29-year run on August 31, 2008 with a strip showing what happened to the members of the Patterson family. Detractors of the strip nicknamed it the 'Strip of Destiny', since it was...a tad Anvilicious in hammering in traditional female roles, what with Deanna quitting her pharmacy work to start a sewing school, and that Elizabeth would be a wife, mother, and teacher for life, and only The Un-Favourite April fulfilling her dream job. This coming on the heels of Elizabeth marrying the Creator's Pet via Strangled by the Red String, and...well, it's no wonder it's also nicknamed the 'Settlpocalypse.'

    **Rapunzel**: Eugene!

-   blink-182's video for "First Date" does this at the end.
-   Bobbie Gentry's "Ode to Billy Joe"; they all lived sadly ever after.

-   And Korn's _Twisted Transistor_.
-   The Statler Brothers' "Class of '57," which was a look at a high school class and what had happened in the years since graduation. A nostalgic but oft-bittersweet song, some of the members go on to blue-collar careers (such as the deliveryman for Sears, the housewives who sell Tupperware or play organ at the local church, the factory worker and the mill worker), while others become leaders in their community (a teacher, an insurance salesman and grocery store owner). One becomes extremely rich (the Cattle Baron), another marries a multi-millionaire. There are tragic tales, such as a classmate who ends up in a mental institution and the young man named Freddie who, after his wife leaves him for another man, commits suicide. And then there are classmates they lost track of, such as Mavis. The chorus' underlying theme is one of high hopes and dreams being complicated when they realize they're in the real world and not with the protection of high school.
-   Van Halen's music video for "Hot for Teacher" ended this way, with Alex going on to become a gynecologist, Michael Anthony becoming a champion sumo in Tokyo, Eddie ending up in a mental ward, David Lee Roth becoming a game show host, and special guest Waldo going on to an uncertain fate after graduation (he became successful with wealth and women, implied to have become a pimp).

-   _American Top 40_: During the Casey Kasem era, this was a frequent feature, where he would update listeners on a popular act or one-hit wonder of past years, usually prior to 1970, and tell what had happened since their last major hit. The feature was parlayed into two _AT40_ specials, called "Disappearing Acts," which was exclusively one-hit wonders and stories about what had happened to these artists since their one brush with fame.

    Theatre continued to live his over-the-top lifestyle. How this hasn't gotten him fired from his bartending job yet is beyond us. Maybe he owns the bar?

-   _Hamilton_'s final song "Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story" lists out what happened to the major characters that live on after Alexander dies in his duel with Aaron Burr.
-   _The History Boys_ has one of the most depressing ones. Poor old Posner. 'Mrs Lintott describes him as living a lonely life, keeping "a scrapbook of the achievements of his one-time classmates" and having "a host of friends... though only on the Internet, and none in his right name or even gender." She concludes by saying "He has long since stopped asking himself where it went wrong."' He gets a (somewhat) happier ending in the film.
-   _Oslo_ tells the story of the secretive back channel conferences that laid the groundwork for the signing of the 1993 Oslo Accord between Israel and Palestine. The actors portray real people involved in the peace talks — as such, when the show ends and the actors deliver a rapid-pace summary of declining Israeli-Palestinian relations from 1993 through 2016 (the year of the show's premiere), the political recap is interspersed with updates on the status of the key players. The death dates of several of the involved politicians and negotiators are declared, with each deceased character leaving the stage when they have recounted their cause of death (be it from assassination, age, or illness).

    Visual Novels lives on the same shelf as Video Games above. They get along really well, and have even begun to share each other's interests. 

-   At the end of every single main series _Ace Attorney_ game (the full game—not just one case), during the credits, there's an epilogue that shows all the characters with unique models (except the killers, and those who have been arrested for other crimes, such as Sal Manella or Machi Tobaye), and what's happening to them after the game ends. Most of them have bugger all information though. Some actually talk about them getting involved with whatever it is they're doing next time you meet them.
    -   There are a few exceptions. The Judge appears in the epilogue of the first game he appears, but no other. Likewise Winston Payne and his brother, Gaspen Payne. The only killers who appear are Ashley Graydon, the final culprit of _The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures_, Courtney Sithe, the third culprit of _The Great Ace Attorney: Resolve_, and Beh'leeb Inmee, the third culprit of _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice_.
    -   Due to the first game's fifth case being a bonus case added to the DS remake, both the fourth and fifth cases have one of these. It's the only game in the series with multiple epilogues.
    -   The DLC cases in recent entries of the series contain short scenes as their epilogues; their characters are not shown in the credits after the main cases. In the DLC case of the fifth game, Marlon Rimes, the villain (though he actually hasn't killed anyone), isn't seen on-screen, but it is shown that he still works at Shipshape Aquarium. In the DLC case of the sixth game, Pierce Nichody, the villain, is still a killer, so he isn't present at the ending, which shows the Sprockets' wedding.
    -   _Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_ also has one of these, depending on how you view it. Luke wonders what Phoenix and Maya are doing once they returned home, cut to them in a courthouse with Edgeworth making a cameo.
-   The Crea route in _Duel Savior Destiny_ ends with us following the heroines as they return from a patrol/cleanup of sorts, showing they're still active in the military. Crea herself is running the country and has a son. When the seven of them all meet up again, Taiga returns home.
-   _Fleuret Blanc_ combines this with Modular Epilogue: you're only guaranteed to see the fate of the judges, Florentine, and Roland. The other members' stories (and that of the Chateau itself) are only revealed if you've completed their subplots; otherwise, the ending slides just have a question mark with the caption "X's future remained a mystery..."
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_'s final arc, Matsuribayashi-hen, concludes with this style of epilogue detailing what happened to all the main cast members after their victory over Takano.
-   _Kindred Spirits on the Roof_ has a variation. On the final day of the main story, as Yuna and Hina are going to help Sachi and Megumi have Their First Time that evening, Yuna briefly crosses paths with each of the other couples and thinks about how they're doing.
-   _Last Chance in Xollywood_: A downplayed example in the second-to-last chapter, where the production of Love Dies Screaming wraps and the narration details what the crew does immediately after. Then the final chapter where several years have passed comes, and the narration talks about all the characters' whereabouts, and whether you still are (or were, in the case any of them have passed away) in good terms with them. There are different lines of dialogue, and different achievements, in the event your relationship stats with any of them were particularly good... or particularly poor.
-   In each ending in _Lake Of Voices_ where you manage to get to the shore safely, you get a short description of everyone's fate depending on the choices you made.

-   The Perfect Ending of _Melody_ manages to tie in all the major characters.
-   _Shinrai: Broken Beyond Despair_ has scenes showing what the surviving cast members are up to in the credits. One such scene can change depending on whether Kotoba lived or died.
-   Starting from the second game, the _Tokimeki Memorial_ series make use of such epilogues in the flagship games of both the Standard and the Girl's Side branches of the series.

    Webcomics joined his behind-the-times brother in his quest for comedy, posting some of the funny doodles online. 

-   _8-Bit Theater_ _finally_ ends on one of these. To note, White Mage is tracking down the Light Warriors to give them _some_ credit for fulfilling the prophecy, the Dark Warriors are now world-renowned heroes having received the credit for everything the Light Warriors did, Red Mage has set up a group for sole survivors of mysterious sects with Dragoon, Thief is now living peacefully in Elfland as the King, and Black Mage and Fighter have disappeared with none of the others being sure of where they are (turns out they're exactly where they started when the comic began).
-   The epilogue of _Adventurers!_ tells how every single character ended up.

-   _Errant Story_ ends this way, starting with a stunning portrait of Sarine and continuing with her report about what happened to key characters (Meji, Sara, Jon, herself, their daughter Mari) and places (Emerylon, Praenubilus Astu, Tsuiraku, others not named).
-   Book five of _Fans!_ has Shanna writing a book of her experience during the God Machine incident as a framing narrative, closing with Shanna recounting the current activities of her old friends, notably Rikk and Ally inviting Rumy to join them as a polyamorous union. T. Campbell had planned on this being the final chapter, but a couple of years later he brought the comic back, set shortly after Shanna's book was published.
    -   The final arc of the _Fans!_ revival ends with a series of wordless single-panel pages showing the future of the strip's cast. Rumy resumes her art career, the Oberfs have their first child while also bonding with Soulson (Rumy's child with an alien from an early arc), Di hooks up with Dexter and Rico starts noticing Helga. The last strip shows the entire cast as crewmembers of an Enterprise Expy seeking new adventures.
-   _Get Medieval_ (though a few named characters got left out, most notably Oneder, Iroth's bodyguard. Worse, The Big Bad gets a Karma Houdini.)
-   After completing _Inverloch_, Ellerton drew bonus pages for each character with a short written summary of what they did after the story ended.

-   The Dark Id's let's play of _Drakengard 2_ ends with one, which describes the chaos and death caused by the "heroes'" destroying both the Knights of the Seal and those seals that hold the world together.

It also foretold the retirement of The Paper in Strong Bad Email #173.
-   Matt Willson has a (unfinished) teaser for a project called 8 Hours, which, from the looks of it, has this sort of effect for _Bonus Stage_ and his earlier project High Score.

    -   M. Night Shyamamalamasamakun's body was never found, which is considered a "twist".
    -   Japanese Michael Bay shot nothing but incoherent battle footage throughout the events of the entire movie. The finished product is said to have still made more sense than _Transformers 2_.

    -   Princess Koyuki's reign brought peace to her people... in addition to becoming a porn star.
    -   Joe Hokage (the abridged series' equilivant of Hiruzen Sarutobi) still has people teasing him about his name.
    -   Iruka (credited as "the annoying sensei guy") wrote the longest _One Piece_ fanfiction of all time.
    -   Turkeylegs wasn't around to tell us what happened to him, but if he were here, we think we would say... "Thank you, Turkeylegs. I am honored by your very presence. You are my friend."

    -   The Rower still rows.
    -   Masako and Vegeta had lots of fun at Six Flags and eventually finished their movie (Naruto: The Abridged Movie).
