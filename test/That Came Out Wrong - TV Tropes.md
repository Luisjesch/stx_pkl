_"Funny how you can say something in your head and it **sounds** fine..."_

A character says something innocuous, but it can easily be misconstrued as something really dirty. Different from Innocent Innuendo in that the audience isn't misled—it's just the character isn't filtering their thoughts properly. Other, more dirty-minded characters may make fun of the speaker or chime in with "That's What She Said!" More commonly, the speaker catches herself and, after a Beat, acknowledges it with the title phrase or something to the same effect like, "You know, now that I'm saying this out loud, I realize how ridiculous/idiotic/wrong it actually sounds".

Several tropes can be used as a result of the things that come out wrong. For example, if a character says something that unintentionally includes Ho Yay in it, then that character often gets Mistaken for Gay as a result.

A related phenomenon is this sequence:

1.  The inadvertent Double Entendre is said.
2.  The speaker moves on to something else, while everyone else is awkwardly silent.
3.  The person closest to the speaker says "Wait for it."
4.  Cue dawning realization and a flustered explanation from the speaker.
5.  The person or people spoken to show an odd reaction towards the speaker through responding either verbally or through body language after the words have been said. For example: Heh Heh, You Said "X".

Verbal Backspace may be employed to select a more appropriate phrase. May degenerate into Digging Yourself Deeper or Freudian Slippery Slope. See also Freudian Slip, Open Mouth, Insert Foot, Lampshaded Double Entendre (which this is a subtrope of, specifically one where the same speaker is also doing the lampshading) and Ambiguous Syntax.

Compare Accidental Innuendo, where this isn't intentional on the writer's part. Also compare to Lying by Omission, where the misrepresentation is generally both precise and intended on the character's part. Related to It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time in a non-innuendo way, where an idea sounded good in your head but turns out to be terrible out loud.

Not to be confused with Came Back Wrong. Basically the verbal version of Not What It Looks Like.

And she's good. **Barry**, when he was alive, he told me even **he** couldn't see how she did some of the tricks. And this **wasn't** even on stage, this was in the Satellite on the JLA table.

-   _Knights of the Dinner Table_: B.A.'s repeated use of the phrase "I've got wood for sheep" while playing a Bland-Name Product version of _Settlers of Catan_. He never works out why everyone else is cracking up.
-   _Zits_:
    -   The history teacher once makes one: "And the Vikings in their pillaging made off with lots of booty." Needless to say, the class was over after she said it.
    -   Likewise, one earlier Sunday strip is made of this trope, in which a museum guide calmly gives the class a tour on "the many wonderful examples of tools", causing Jeremy and Hector to mutter "Tools" at each other and dissolve into barely contained giggles. The guide goes on to explain to the class how "Some tools are very large... some are nearly microscopic", then asks them "Can you think of a tool you have in your pocket right now? What tool do you use every day?" It's a wonder they kept straight faces for as long as they did.
    -   The 9 October 2013 strip has Connie tell Jeremy and Sarah to have fun and then feels the need to clarify that she meant _scholarly_ fun and tells them to "study hard - I mean well".

    Fan Works 

-   Most of the dialogues of the Homestuck fancomic _Alabaster: The Doomed Session_ are filled with innuendo, both intentional and completely accidental.
-   _Naruto: Rend_
    
    **Naruto:** Hey Ichigo. You got a minute.  
    **Ichigo:** Naruto? What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be catching up with that woman? What's her name... Hinata?  
    **Naruto:** She's getting dinner with Nel. Besides, we're roommates so we'll have lots of time together.  
    **Ichigo:** _\[raises eyebrow\]_  
    **Naruto:** It's not like that!
    
-   In _Amazing Fantasy_, Izuku says the day after he got a grasp on his Venom Strike and shocked Peter again, he tried it again and let the sparks fly... before admonishing the reader and saying that they know what he means.
-   _Another Wedding Alone_:
    
    **Harry:** Do you know who wants to date me? Gold diggers and Draco. No one else. Not Luna, not Hermione, not Hannah, not Susan, not-  
    **Ron:** I get it, mate. Times are dry, you have to keep busy with your own wand... wait, that didn't come out right!
    
-   Don Paolo invokes the trope by name in the humorous _Professor Layton_ story _Beloved My Cheeseburger_. When the story's _other_ villain states that Layton is the only one who could possibly stop him, Paolo objects.
    
    "I can stop you!" Don Paolo snapped. "I'm greater than Layton! I build flying machines and soup up cars to turn them into gliders! Not to mention I'm extremely handy with latex!" He paused. "That came out wrong."
    
-   _The Best Revenge_ has this non-sexual variant during a dinner between Narcissa, Draco, Harry and Snape:
    
    **Narcissa**: My son, the quidditch fanatic. No brooms this year, Draco. How are you going to console yourself?  
    **Draco**: With potions. Er-I mean-studying and learning how to make potions. In Potions class. Not taking them. Eeww.
    
-   _Blackened Bluebird_ has a Played for Drama example. Knowing that May is a tragic victim of circumstance and Salem's manipulations, one of Ozpin's agents offers her the chance to defect, telling her that Ozpin can find a way to remove the grimm blood she has been infused with and make "everything just like it was before". What they mean is preventing May's transformation into a half-grimm abomination. However, May transitioned using that grimm blood infusion, so what it comes across as is "Ozpin wants to detransition you." Understandably, she reacts poorly.
-   _Blackened Skies_: Teruteru enjoys making racy remarks as part of his wannabe Lovable Sex Maniac persona... and also as a coping mechanism, as he tries to deal with the stresses of the mutual killing games by cracking jokes. This is so deeply ingrained that he honestly struggles with _not_ making lewd comments - something that naturally causes friction with the other students, who repeatedly make clear that they're not amused.
-   _The Bolt Chronicles_:
    -   In “The Paris Trip,” Mittens has sex with Berlioz the night before she leaves for home. During the airport cab ride the next morning, Bolt asks a clearly sad Mittens “What’s gotten into you anyway?” She breaks into a mischievous smile, thinking that sometimes the best jokes are unintentional.
    -   In “The Coyote,” Bolt inadvertently lets slip to Charlie the Coyote that he and Mittens (who the coyote is hoping to catch and eat) are sexual partners.
        
        **Charlie:** _\[with a knowing look\]_ Ohhh, now I see. You’re fattening her up, saving the choice kitty bits all for yourself.
        
        **Bolt:** _\[blustering\]_ Will you puh-leeze drop the subject already? I guarantee you, nobody’s gonna taste her choice kitty bits but me. Mittens is MINE, darn it! MINE!
        
        **Charlie:** _\[blinking incredulously\]_ Um, hang on a sec. Are we even talking about the same thing anymore? You’re actually saying you have feelings for… a cat?
        
        **Bolt:** _\[eyes widening as he shifts uncomfortably\]_ That’s enough! You’re getting me all discombobulated — I can’t even think straight! Look, none of this matters, okay? You just get your shabby carcass outta here and leave my cat alone!
        
-   In _The Bridge_, Monster X attempts to steal Aria Blaze's magical necklace, called the Heart of a Siren. At one point, he says, "Surrender your heart to me, and I will keep it safe." Aria starts furiously blushing, while Monster X groans and says he was talking about the necklace.
-   In _Bruce Has a Problem_, Commissioner Gordon talks with his daughter about her resuming a relationship with Dick Grayson, when he had been under the impression lately that she had been playing for the other team, as it were:
    
    **Gordon:** Not that there's anything wrong with that! I mean, If you'd actually told me, I would have been completely supportive of any of your lifestyle choices.  
    **Barbara:** I'm not a lesbian, dad.  
    **Gordon:** Well, obviously not, since you obviously like Dick—  
    **Barbara:** _\[stares at her dad for a long moment before suddenly cracking up\]_  
    **Gordon:** That's not what I meant!
    
-   Chris Dee's _Cat Tales_, in the fourth story, "Catfight": Bruce is talking to his (dead) father's portrait, in an attempt to resolve some issues:
    
    "If I had a nickel for every time I said I'd take her down, and she tried to flay me with that whip while I tried to get the cuffs on her..."  
    Bruce stopped as his imagination caught up with the words he was speaking, and he envisioned his conservative, middle-aged father's reaction to this evocative imagery.  
    "It's not as kinky as it sounds," Bruce lied.
    
-   In _Choose Your Snake_ Barty Crouch Jr. comments on Voldemort's fixation on Harry.
    
    **Barty:** He'd like it if you were his follower but you'll never bow to him. It makes you interesting.  
    **Harry:** Great. Either follow the madman and become his plaything or let him be my stalker and become his plaything. Either way, I'm screwed.  
    **Barty:** You know... your statement could be taken the wrong way.
    
-   In _Christian Humber Reloaded_, Vash, after killing Soku, apologizes to the kids for doing it in front of them, because he doesn't want his enemies to find out that he has "a thing for children". This was meant to show that he is a Friend to All Children, but the kids initially think he's a pedophile.
-   In _Daphne Greengrass and the Boy Who Lived_, Daphne initially worries about being a victim of this despite her friendship with Harry, Ron and Hermione, as she feels that she has to insult the likes of Neville when interacting with her fellow Slytherins to avoid making trouble for her family but worries that Neville and others will think she means such comments about how he’s basically a Squib.
-   In another Beast Boy/Raven example, _Deadpan Love_ has Raven telling her teammates (after the two had their first date) that she's going to bed. Beast Boy saying "I'll join you" certainly didn't sound right in the context. Thankfully, Raven isn't too angry at the slip.
-   In _Deception_ Harry demonstrates his ability to change into a _floor lamp_ to Draco and McGonagall.
    
    **Harry:** You can even turn me on, oh, that didn't sound right, I meant you could turn the light on.
    
-   From _Death Note: The Abridged Series (kpts4tv)_:
-   _A Destroyer's Remorse_: Sena suggests she and Lanz "do a workout." Lanz thinks it's a great idea. Sena's father rather snippily asks _exactly_ what they mean by "workout." Lanz just blinks and talks about their normal weights, calisthenics, and cardio routine, while Sena realizes what her father was implying.
-   _Doing It Right This Time_: When Misato and Asuka argue about Shinji's shooting skills, this exchange happens:
    
    "The rookie did good," Misato declared. "In fact, I think he did better than your first time, Asuka."  
    "My first time was at the age of seven," Asuka retorted. "Besides, it's all just point and squirt; you'd expect a boy to be capable of that by his age." Then she thought about what she'd just said. "Ugh! Please don't ever quote that out of context. Or at all, in fact."
    
-   In _Do You Believe in Fairies?_, Evelyn asks Toby if he wants to "watch Netflix and chill". When he starts blushing, she rethinks her wording and understands what she accidentally said.
-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_ has a few of these, several centered around characters only knowing one definition of the word "Balls". Goku is also a fountain of material for this, but never quite realizes it.
    -   There's also the accidental calls to George Takei...
        
        **Goku:** Then he went and brought this really _horny_ guy!  
        **George:** Oh my.  
        **Goku:** Who's that, King Kai?  
        **King Kai:** It's George Takei. Somehow we made this into a three-way.  
        **George:** _Ohhhh my!_  
        **King Kai:** _Call!_ Three-way _call!_
        
    -   During Popo's training session:
        
        **Tien:** No! Chiaotzu, my partner!  
        **Yamcha:** ... gay.  
        **Tien:** Hey, at least I don't spend all of _my_ free time living alone with a cat!  
        **Yamcha:** Hey, at least _I_ get some puss— wow, that did NOT come out right.
        
    -   From a later episode, when the Ginyu Force arrives on Namek:
        
        **Ginyu:** Now, Jeice, we need to touch on Freeza's balls.  
        **Jeice:** Uh, Captain...  
        **Ginyu:** Yes, yes. Realized it the moment I said it.
        
    -   With all the innuendo Cell spouts, it was inevitable he'd slip up sooner or later:
        
        **Cell**: I'm gonna need that time machine, so I can—  
        **Trunks**: Go back in time and absorb the Cyborgs.  
        **Cell**: So I can achieve my—  
        **Trunks**: "Perfect" form.  
        **Cell**: Okay, you _suck._ You are sucking _all_ the fun out of this! _I'm_ the only one who sucks here, boy—that came out wrong.  
        **Trunks**: Nah, sounds right to me.
        
-   In _Albus Dumbledore and the Harbinger of Magic_ Cedric apologizes to his fellow Triwizard Tournament competitors for being a poor sportsman during and after the First Task.
    
    **Fleur:** I got an extra point out of it, and you lost two points. For me, that is enough of a punishment.  
    **Sophithea:** And I am going to spank your bottom in the next two tasks so hard that no one will remember the first task by the time I am done. That may not have come out like I intended.
    
-   _Equestria Girls: Friendship Souls_: While Shining Armor is training Twilight Sparkle, she complains that she's in pain. He says, "Your body will adapt, and it will get easier, but it always hurts the first time..." Twilight gets embarrassed as he realizes how dirty that sounded and says, "Yeesh, never thought I'd be saying stuff like that to my little sister."
-   _Fantasy of Utter Ridiculousness_: This exchange takes place in the middle of a conversation that was going nowhere:
    
    **Reisen:** ...You could use some work on your metaphors.  
    **Patchouli:** _\[aims her spellbook at Reisen\]_ Mind your own business. This is between me and the rat, no-one else. Unless you like being rabbit stew, in which case feel free to fly between us.  
    **Reisen:** I don't need to catch your eyes to be a distraction! ...Wait, that didn't come out right...
    
-   In _Fate Revelation Online_ Diabel spars with Shirou so the latter can make him a sword. When Diabel arrives to pick up the sword, Lisbeth, having recently had a discussion about a Diabel/Shirou pairing, completely misinterprets them discussing the spar.
    
    **Shirou:** It's ready. If you're prepared, I can give it to you now. _\[Lisbeth takes notice\]_  
    **Diabel:** Thank you. But if you're so rough every time, then even if it's amazing, this will be the last time. _\[Lisbeth starts blushing\]_  
    **Shirou:** Ah. I'm sorry, I just got excited.  
    **Diabel:** _\[deciding to mess with Lisbeth\]_ In that case, I look forward to receiving more from you in the future. But as it is, I am prepared for it right now.  
    **Shirou:** _\[completely oblivious\]_ Right.  
    _\[Lisbeth panics\]_
    
-   _Fever Dreams_ has poor drunk Matsuda...
    
    **Matsuda:** It was so horrible. I- I feel like I've violated Misa-Misa just by listening to those lies being told to her... I don't want to have sex with two men and Misa-Misa at the same time... (\*everyone stares\*) No, no, I'm not with this guy, he's just my friend who has sex with my other male friend. I really like women a lot and any women who want to be with me, I'll respect them incredibly hard and skillfully with all the right respectful lines that I'm going to learn.

-   _A Game of Cat and Cat_: "(In)Effective Communication": As the chapter title says. A request for details was almost misinterpreted as an expression of incredulity:
    
    Kazuya waved off the compliment. "That's different. I had help. _How did you survive?_"
    

Soma bit back the urge to give a sarcastic reply. The longer this conversation went on, the more he was sure that Kazuya lacked any capacity for subtlety; if he thought Soma was being an idiot, it would have shown on his face.  
"Let me rephrase that before you get the wrong idea," Kazuya added when he saw Soma's expression. "When… um… monsters attacked, how did you stop them from killing you? Are you good at dodging or running? Do you attack so fast that they can't hit you, or are you so strong that you can destroy them with one mighty blow? What kind of armor do you favor?"

    **Zatanna:** Usually doesn't.

    **Ginny:** As you saw for yourself, Harry can take care of himself when it comes to mum. You know she has a soft spot for him.

The Hyuga then says she wouldn't even know where to start if she was, only for Tenten (who's a weapon specialist) to tell her "I could lend you a whip."

    **Marinette:** Yeah. I mean, I've had sleepovers with people besides Alya, but this is definitely my first time having one with guys.

    _\[long Beat as Marinette, well aware of Adrien's social cluelessness, tries to think of the best way to explain the implications of what he just said\]_  
    **Adrien:** Umm, Mari? I didn't say anything weird did I? Sorry, it's just, you started blushing suddenly but I wasn't sure if it was something I said or not.  
    **Marinette:** No, well, I mean yes, but it's okay. I figured you probably didn’t even realize what you said. _\[Adrien shakes his head. Marinette blushes again and continues trying to figure out how to explain this; she turns back to him and clears her throat_\] Okay, basically, boys and girls don't really have sleepovers together, except maybe sometimes when they're little kids. So, like, a boy and a girl having a sleepover at our age, for example, kind of implies that they’re doing _something_, if you catch my drift. _\[Adrien does not catch her drift; Marinette sighs, grabs his shoulders and looks him in the eyes\]_ Listen carefully, because I'm sure I can only manage to say this once without combusting. When a boy and a girl have a sleepover, it’s usually because they want to have sex. So, what you said about me being popular and having sleepovers with everyone basically implies that you think that I—  
    **Adrien:** _\[turns "what was probably a yet-undiscovered shade of red"\]_ Oh my gosh I'm so, so sorry!

    **Pearl:** Even if your ridiculous plan succeeded, you’d only have two brains to snack on anyway since I’m a Gem. Which means I don’t _have_ a brain. (_beat_) Wait, I didn't mean it like that!

-   It happens to poor Izzy in _My Little Pony: A New Generation_ when she comes to Maretime Bay and tries to introduce herself to the Earth Ponies that live there, all of whom are terrified of Unicorns and believe they are evil mind-reading witches:
    
    **Izzy:** Now, I know what you're all thinking—
    
    **Sprout:** AAAGH! SHE'S ALREADY READING OUR MINDS!!!
    
-   In _Shrek_, the title character briefly leaves Princess Fiona behind temporarily because he "has to save his ass." He was actually referring to Donkey (who is exactly what it says on the tin), but Fiona thought he meant he was going to abandon her, causing her to call him out for the action.
    
    **Fiona:** What kind of knight _are_ you?!  
    **Shrek:** One of a kind.
    
-   _Wreck-It Ralph_: _Hero's Duty_ has the unfortunate trait of sounding like "Hero's Doody," a pun on another word for excrement. Vanellope takes advantage of this. It's even intentionally used in its commercial's tagline: "It's the biggest Duty of all." Or, you're supposed to read it as "It's the biggest doody of all!"

    Films — Live-Action

-   _The Art of War_:
    -   The Action Survivor is getting annoyed at Neil Shaw when he starts giving her orders after virtually kidnapping her.
        
        **Julia Fang:** It must be nice to assume that I will bend over for you whenever you please. _\[Neil Shaw starts to speak\]_ It's bend over backwards, I know!
        
    -   Averted when Neil Shaw later tells her to strip (because he thinks a tracking device has been planted on her). When she objects, he just shouts her down rather than doing a Verbal Backspace.
-   _Black Sheep (1996)_: Towards the end, Mike tries to reveal that Governor Tracy had committed voter fraud in her last electoral win.
    
    **Mike:** Listen, we've all been screwed by Governor Tracy! And now, I'm gonna screw her!  
    _\[everybody gasps in disgust\]_  
    **Mike:** I mean, I have evidence here you need to know about now before it's too late!
    
-   _Circle_: After the Lawyer is swiftly killed because he argued that they should kill the Lesbian before she molests her own daughter:
    
    **Husband:** What if he had a point?  
    **One-Armed Man:** Just drop it already!  
    **Husband:** No, not about the gay stuff.
    
-   _Clue_ has this exchange in one of the three endings:

    **Wadsworth:** I know. So I choose to expose myself.  
    **Colonel Mustard:** Please, there are ladies present!

-   _Deadpool (2016)_: In the Flashback, Wade Wilson is shown on a mercenary job, scaring away a teenage girl's stalker. A phrasing issue occurs as he's threatening the creep.
    
    **Wade:** Even _look_ in her general direction again, and you will learn, in the worst of ways, that I have some hard spots too! _\[Beat\]_ That came out wrong. _\[leans in, whispers\]_ _Or did it?_ _\[kisses him\]_
    
-   Occurs repeatedly in _Down Periscope_ when the Captain Dodge is introducing their _female_ dive officer to the ship's otherwise all-male crew.
    
    **Dodge:** I know this is an unusual situation. Can't be easy for Lt. Lake here to be thrown into a jungle such as this, and I know it will make things hard on all of us... _\[laughter\]_ ...Let me re-phrase that. It's going to make things _difficult_ on all of us as well. But if we just work together as a team, I'm sure we can handle ourselves... _\[more laughter\]_ ..._comport_ ourselves as professionals.
    
-   _Get Smart_: When KAOS discovers the identities of the CONTROL agents, Larabee volunteers to go out to the field:
    
    **Larabee:** Let me out there, sir! I have no problem exposing myself.  
    **Agent 99:** Do you ever think before you speak?  
    **Larabee:** No, I just whip it out there. Seems to work best.
    
-   _Grosse Pointe Blank_:
    
    **Debi:** You're a psychopath.  
    **Martin:** No, no. Psychopaths kill for no reason. I kill for money. It's a _job_... That didn't sound right.
    
-   A little one crops up in _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_, which is a little weird in retrospect given that the two characters in the scene (Harry and Hermione) are about 14 years old:
    
    **Hermione:** Harry, you told me you'd figured that egg out weeks ago! The task is two days from now!  
    **Harry:** Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.  
    **Hermione:** Wouldn't know. We don't actually talk about the tournament. Actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's more of a physical being.  
    **Harry:** _\[snicker\]_  
    **Hermione:** I just mean he's not particularly loquacious.
    
-   The ending to _How To Be Single_ has a very awkward Ho Yay moment between Alice and Robin.
    
    **Alice:** I know I can unzip my dress, but I want you to do it for me. _\[Robin gives a weird look\]_ That sounded really weird. I want you to watch me unzip my dress. _\[Robin still has a weird look\]_ That sounded very sexual. That's not what I meant.
    
-   Martha says this in _Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle_ when she gets in an argument with her gym teacher about how pointless gym class is. At the end of the argument, she says "Who wants to spend their time acting like a gym teacher?" before she remembers who she is talking to. The next we see her is in the principal's office.
-   _Jurassic Park (1993)_ has a scene where Gennaro (while watching a presentation) asks "Are these characters auto... erotic?" (presumably trying to say "automated" or "animatronic" but saying a mix of the two by mistake.) Hammond just says "We have no animatronics here", but is clearly struggling to maintain his composure.
-   _Laughter in Paradise_: During her spirited defense of Captain Russell in the courtroom, Shelia declares "This is bloody justice!"; earning her a shocked look from the magistrate. She then holds up one of Russell's novels, a western titled _Bloody Justice_, that she was referring to in order to prove he had an occupation.

    -   In _The Avengers (2012)_, Agent Coulson is a huge fanboy of Captain America.
    -   In _Iron Man 3_, Happy tries to describe to Tony what Killian's holographic presentation to Pepper on the mind looks like.
        
        **Happy:** He's showing her his big brain. _And she likes it._
        
    -   Peter Quill gives one in his Rousing Speech in _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_:
        
        **Peter Quill:** When I look around, you know what I see? Losers. _\[everyone looks at him\]_ I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff.
        
-   In _Night School (2018)_, Mila (a juvenile delinquent attending night school with various adults) attempts to defy this when she tells Theresa (a former teen mom and fellow night student) that she's going to try and get into college after getting her GED because seeing the other night school students has given her more incentive not to turn out like them. When she starts apologizing for how that might come across, Theresa assures Mila that she understands what the younger girl means, and even suggests that they try and get into the same college so that they can be study partners.
-   In _Plan B_, Bruno and Pablo have a Seinfeldian Conversation about how they wish they could have filmed the world as they saw it as children. Bruno remarks, "Let's go to the movies one of these days," to which Pablo automatically agrees, then there's a subtle Beat as it dawns on them that Bruno's statement sounded a lot like he was asking Pablo out on a date. Pablo asks him, "Why did you say that?" and Bruno replies, "I don't know. Free association, I guess." May also count as a Freudian Slip, considering that Bruno is in denial about being attracted to Pablo for most of the film.
-   _Raising the Wind_:
    -   When Mervyn tells the others about Mrs. Deevens, his deaf landlady:
        
        **Mervyn**: The point is, you see, the landlady's absolutely as deaf as a post. They couldn't be more perfect. You have to write everything down for her. Well, there's no use banging on her door or anything like that. I banged away for _hours_ yesterday. (Beat) Nothing happened.
        
    -   When Mervyn tries to convince the others to let Miranda move in with them, he remarks that they're all "bosom friends". Once he realises what he's said, he stutters and stammers and tries to explain that he's had her in mind to move in for a while.

-   _Shaun of the Dead_: The group is hiding in a pub from the zombies, trying to be as quiet as possible, when the jukebox suddenly starts playing "Don't Stop Me Now":

    **David:** What.  
    **Shaun:** The jukebox!
    
-   In _Sherlock Holmes (2009)_, Irene Adler leaves Holmes chained naked to a bed with a pillow covering both his privates and the key to the chains. Holmes's efforts to persuade the chambermaid to help him could have been worded better:
    
    **Sherlock Holmes:** Madam, I need you to remain calm and trust me; I'm a professional. But beneath this pillow lies the key to my release.
    
-   In _She's the Man_, Paul said to Viola before she enters Ilyria, even lampshading:
    
    **Paul:** Just remember, inside every girl, there's a boy. _\[pause\]_ That came out wrong, but you know what I mean.
    
-   In _Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)_, while Tom and Maddie try to sneak Sonic into a building through a luggage bag, the two people next to them can hear Sonic and ask if his child is in his bag. Tom says no, but then clarifies that "yes, it's a child, but it's not mine", which prompts the other two people to walk away looking visibly weirded out.
-   In _Transformers (2007)_, Sam has a Freudian Slip and blurts out to Michaela:

-   _Up Pompeii_:
    -   Lurcio trying to tell the audience what he does for Ammonia:
        
        **Lurcio**: I say "mistress", I mean don't I mean we... well I don't mean I... er, well... I mean I _serve_ her. (Beat) No, no, I mean, um, I try to give her satisfaction, I- Oh, form your own opinion.
        
    -   When Lurcio asks a Christian how he survived being thrown to the lions:
        
        **Lurcio**: Oh, what happened? Did Nero have his thumb up? (Beat) I'll rephrase that.
        
-   _X-Men: Apocalypse_ has this when Professor X visits his old flame Moira McTaggert (whose memories he erased the last time they met):
    
    **Xavier:** It's wonderful to see you again — to, to meet you again for, for the first time, uh — you've got a son?!  
    **Moira:** _\[puzzled\]_ Yes.  
    **Xavier:** Does he have a husband? Uhm...
    
-   In _X-Men: First Class_, the loud-and-clear message of Xavier's Oh, Crap! face after he says "they were just following orders." Played for Drama, as it was Magneto, someone who has been "at the mercy of men just following orders before", that heard him. Needless to say, he wasn't happy.

    Literature 

-   _Ascendance of a Bookworm_: While reading these, note that Myne is a seven year old girl as far as most people are concerned and that both Ferdinand and Benno are single adult men:
    -   Early in Part 2, Myne needs to change outfits in the Gilberta Company, but the fact that the employee changing rooms are in the attic doesn't mix well with her low stamina. Benno's solution is to have a screen set up in his office and call a female servant to help Myne change. When Myne's friend Lutz comes down from his own changing room and sees Myne in her new outfit, her explanation is that "Benno helped".
    -   In Part 3, Ferdinand mentions the fact that he (unwillingly) ended up watching Myne take a bath while he was visiting her Past-Life Memories in a way that makes it sound like he and Myne took a bath together.
-   Courtesy of Clockpunk from "Clockpunk and the Vitalizer":
    
    **Clockpunk:** Dr. Awesome seriously has to give me more to work with, lest this... this ne'er-do-well pound me into the concrete.  
    Hm. Not the best choice of words.
    
-   Averted by Mustrum Ridcully of _Discworld_: he's blissfully unaware of saying anything wrong about the University's mighty organ, which is a Johnson (that is, the University's giant pipe organ was made by Bergholt Stuttgart "Bloody Stupid" Johnson), and nobody wants to correct him as this would only lead to further embarrassment.
-   In _The Dresden Files_ book _Turn Coat_, Harry offers to help the leader of the White Council, the Merlin, prove the innocence of Morgan, as the politics involved in the situation prevent the Merlin from finding anything helpful without making it look like he's trying to save his own ass. When he asks why Harry intends to help him, Harry responds, "Because your balls are in a vise and I'm the only one who can pull them out." Cue arched eyebrow from the Merlin.
    
    **Harry:** Okay. That came out a little more homoerotic than I intended.  
    **Merlin:** Indeed.
    
-   _Falling Up_ by Brian J Bromberg: Gregg is in a bar with a drunk Alvaro, who shows him a sketch he made, then demands to know what Gregg has been working on:
    
    **Alvaro:** I showed you mine, now you show me yours!  
    **Gregg:** You mind not screaming that so loudly?
    
-   In _Heart In Hand_, this conversation happens after Alex agrees to let the producers of his reality TV hockey show with Darryl pay for their plane trips and jokingly dubs it a "booty call":
    
    **Darryl:** Look, aren't you going to feel guilty if a tv network ends up paying for - for booty calls, as you said? I still can't believe you said that, by the way!  
    **Alex:** Wait, is that trick question or something? First, nobody take what I say seriously, Darryl, and two, why feel guilty? I mean, yes, is definitely going to be booty call, but they also gonna film us!  
    _\[Beat\]_  
    **Alex:** Er, I didn't mean like that.
    
-   In _The Heroes of Olympus_, this is said word for word when Annabeth says she'll "flash" Leo to get his attention.
-   _Keeper of the Lost Cities_: In _Lodestar_, Sophie and Keefe hold hands as they levitate through an area. Sophie has recently manifested as an Enhancer, which makes her enhance the abilities of whomever she's touching — in this case, Keefe's empathic abilities. Keefe, who has not yet been informed of this, voices his observations:
    
    "So, quick question," he said as they picked their way through an especially dark hallway. "Is there a reason I keep getting this crazy rush every time I touch your hand?" He cleared his throat when he realized how that sounded, "What I mean is, your emotions always feel strong. But now they're on another level."
    
-   In _The Rise of Kyoshi,_ Kyoshi is surprised when Rangi, Yun's overly-serious and attractive female bodyguard, comes to sleep in her tent while they're in hostile territory.
    
    "Shouldn’t you be sleeping with Yun?" Kyoshi said.  
    Rangi’s head snapped so fast she almost snapped her own neck.  
    "You know what I mean," Kyoshi said.
    
-   In _The Sacred Blacksmith_, Cecily asks Luke to forge her a katana, but he refuses. She declares she will prove herself worthy to wield one, puts her hand over her chest, and says she wants him to look at her. Luke blushes and Lisa gets excited. Cecily realizes what she just said and gets really embarrassed, trying to explain that she wanted him to see her heart and soul, not her body.
-   _Scrapped Princess_: After capturing the Cassull siblings, Princess Seness challenges Shannon to a duel. When he asks why, she meant to say she wanted him for her army since she knew he was a D-Knight. Except she didn't say it that way:
    
    **Seness:** _\[smug grin, while drawing her sword\]_ I want you, Shannon Cassull, and I intend to have you.  
    **Raquel:** _\[gasps and covers her mouth in alarm\]_ My! How forward!  
    **Sness:** _\[irate\]_ Don't get the wrong idea! I only want you for my army!
    
-   _Spy School_: Lampshaded in one scene where Warren is being questioned once by the CIA.
    
    **Warren:** I don't know anything, my mind is completely empty. Wait a minute. That's not what I meant...
    
-   A variation happens in _Sword Art Online_, as the characters in question don't realize how wrong it came out _until a few hours later_. Kirito tells Asuna that he wants to spend the night with her, and given that he said it right after they saved each other from a murderer and confessed their love with a kiss, it's no surprise what Asuna assumed. So naturally, when she turns the lights off and strips down to her underwear, Kirito awkwardly tries to explain that he didn't mean it _that_ way, much to her anger and embarrassment.
-   In _Unlimited Fafnir_, Yuu is questioned about his first meeting with Iris. He summoned a wave of water to interrupt Iris's summoning after a Naked First Impression. But the way she describes it, it makes him sound like a pervert trying to rip her clothing off, which doesn't help his situation any.

    Pinball 

-   Narrowly averted with Stern Pinball's _Mustang_; the Spelling Bonus drop targets for G-E-A-R-S were originally supposed to spell S-H-I-F-T until someone noticed what would be written if someone knocked down the letter "F"...

    Podcasts 

-   A discussion of the novelization of the _Doctor Who_ story "The Aztecs" on the _Doctor Who Target Book Club Podcast_ about a possible reference to Jesus goes over one panelist's head, despite the character in the book being crucified, leading the host to say, "But that's just it... that kinda nails it down..." before falling apart in a fit of giggles.
-   Subverted in the RiffTrax for _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_, during the battle of Gondor. Apparently that came out exactly _right_:
    
    **Bill:** Nice. Nothing like a good sack. Always cheers me up.  
    **Mike:** _\[snickering\]_ I bet it does.  
    **Bill:** Yeah, a sweaty, blood-soaked sack will always improve my mood!  
    **Mike:** Wow.  
    **Kevin:** Bill, might want to reconsider your choice of words about the battle...  
    **Bill:** ...Battle?
    

    Pro Wrestling 

    Radio 

-   In The BBC Radio 4 comedy _God Squad_, the tiny Christian Society at a university has accidentally started an environmental protest at the Freshers' Fair, and realise that the reaction they're getting from other students is the most positive support they've ever had. Despite being bad at public speaking, the organiser attempts to capitalise on this by talking about all the things environmentalists and Christians have in common, like wanting to protect the planet, and the life upon it. She concludes "I am pro-Earth! And I am pro-life! ...oh, no."

    Roleplay 

-   _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_:
    -   Ciro tries to advise Michal on controlling his superpower, only to realise with embarrassment that his advice sounds like it's referring to something more salacious:
        
        **Ciro:** You just have to put up with it until you can get back to your room. Or sneak off somewhere private, like a toilet or something, and let it out...
        
    -   Since Harriet has nowhere to stay for the night, Sebastian offers to shack her up in his house. His wording causes her to worry that he'll do something 'strange' to her, much to the amusement of his friends.

    Theatre 

-   _Boston Marriage_ has subplots involving a fur muff that Claire received as a gift, and Anna's oven needing repairs that can't be carried out until replacement parts arrive, which combine to produce the moment when Anna's maid innocently declares, "While I was admiring your muff, your parts came."
-   In _Holy Musical B@man!_, while Green Lantern is having a conversation with Superman, GL reveals that he knows Superman's obvious secret identity. He then tries to make him feel better by saying, "Come on, nobody cares who Superman is."
-   Said pretty much verbatim by Warner in _Legally Blonde_ during the breakup scene, when he accidentally implies he thinks Elle is tacky (it's unclear whether he actually thinks that, but he clearly didn't mean to say it).
    
    **Warner:** I'm gonna need somebody serious  
    Less of a "Marilyn", more of a "Jackie"  
    Serious  
    Somebody classy but not too tacky —  
    **Elle:** WHAT?  
    **Warner:** Okay, that came out wrong...
    
    -   In a later scene, when Elle takes Emmett clothes shopping, she comments about how she loves shopping for men and "watching them change right before my eyes"... just as Emmett is trying on some things in the dressing room.
        
        **Emmett:** Don't watch me change!
        
-   In _The Music Man_, the mayor mixes up a few words in his speech and ends up insulting his wife. The extent to which this is played up or glossed over depends on the production.
    
    **Mayor:** The Wa Tan Ye girls of the local wigwam of Heeawatha will present a spectacle, my wife — (Beat) _In which_ my wife, Eulalie MacKecknie Shinn, will take a leading part.
    
-   Noah Smith's stage version of _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_:
    -   While providing medical care to Cybel, a prostitute, Jekyll tells her that she needs to be in bed, then quickly adds "And I mean _resting_."
    -   Helen lowers her neckline to show Jekyll a birthmark and asks what he thinks; he responds "That's a very lovely neck" before verbally backspacing.
-   The song "Putting It Together" from Stephen Sondheim's _Sunday in the Park with George_ features this lyric:
    
    Gotta keep a link with your tradition  
    Gotta learn to trust your intuition  
    While you re-establish your position  
    So that you can be on exhibit...  
    _\[Beat\]_  
    So that your _work_ can be on exhibition!
    
-   Invoked verbatim in Samuel D. Hunter's play _The Whale_: "There are other people, people like Charlie, for whom this amazing plan doesn't fit. You can't fit a round peg in a square hole, and you certainly can't fit a morbidly obese gay peg in a Mormon hole... that came out wrong."

    Video Games 

-   _Anarchy Reigns_: The Baron challenges Sasha to a fight. Jack asks if he has the endurance, and the Baron shouts that "I'll be done in thirty seconds!" Then it hits him.

    **Girl:** Indeed...  
    **Ezio:** Wait... that came out wrong.

-   From _Batman: Arkham Knight_, courtesy of the Riddler.

-   _Borderlands_ series: Multiple games:
    -   From _Borderlands 2_, out of Moxxi:

    -   From _Borderlands 3_, out of Marcus's ammo vending machines:

    -   In Hendry's first visit, he tries to figure out how to relate to his daughter better by striking up a conversation with Freya and Aqua for ideas. Unfortunately, leading with asking about their age and about "what kinds of things kids like doing" comes off in a way he didn't intend. It doesn't help that he suddenly moves closer to the girls while doing so.
    -   In Episode 2, Lucas tries helping Riona with her singing career amidst the prejudice by suggesting that she should "sell" herself, to Jorji's shock since he thinks he's talking about sex work.

        **Lucas:** No Pops, not that kind!!
        
-   _Dragon Age: Origins_ has awkward, virginal Alistair agree to sex with a female Warden romancing him thus, if she initiates it: "I don't know, I'm willing to give it a shot if you are."

You weren't joking about the idiot part" - but Alistair will be very hurt and dump her if you do this.

This sends Yamakage into a panic, wondering what he'd done to warrant the Namazu kidnapping his daughter and holding her for ransom. As it turns out, Yamakage's daughter had gotten lost and wandered too close to the serpent-infested One River, so the Namazu had escorted her to the safety of Yuzuka Manor. What Gyoshu meant to say is that Yamakage's daughter is with him and to come pick her up.

-   _Acts of Gord_:
    
    **Notes to self:**  
    Talking to a person about being into the hardcore gaming scene is completely different than talking to them about the hardcore anime scene. In future, I must find a new adjective.
    
    And do not, I repeat, do not say "if she is really into the hardcore anime scene, I can get import DVD's from Japan and Hong Kong" when I'm talking to a 14-year-old girl's mother.
    
    Further notation: Do not attempt to salvage this by then saying "I mean, I can get DVDs from Japan that you can't get here."
    
    Next time, say "really likes anime" and "can get DVD's not on sale here yet."

    "Yeah! Nikki keeps fondling my bling-bling!" From the hoots of derision, I could tell that I could have phrased that better.

-   _Honest Trailers_: In the trailer for _Zootopia_, the narrator has several missteps when talking about the film's messages.
    
    **Narrator:** So settle in for a fantastically animated, well-told lesson about disproving stereotypes, even though the fox character really is sneaky, the weasels do cheat, and the sloths are slow. Oh, wait, no. Does this mean _I'm_ racist? I owned a bunch of rabbits when I was a kid. I mean... No, they were mine, but not that I... You know, not like they're property or, uh... Look, I love rabbits, okay?! This... That came out all wrong! Go to starring! _Go to starring!_

-   _Joueur du Grenier_ do this from time to time.
    
    -   For example in the TMNT special:
    
    **JdG:** Relatively speaking, the racism was okay... \[beat\] That's absolutely not what I meant.
    
    -   And again in the _Duke Nukem Forever_ review, where he complains that "at least in the earlier games the women didn't talk." before clarifying he meant that at least they didn't spew vapid, innuendo-filled idiocies like they constantly do in _Forever_.
-   _Jerma985_:
    -   From "Jersey Boys in Sentry Town":
        
        **Jerma:** _\[after he died anticipating Star\_ to tell his story\]_ Yeah but I was paying attention to the notion that you were going to tell the story, that's it, as I was sitting there, whacking the gun<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  \*STAR\_ tried to stifle his laugh\*
        
    -   Lampshaded in 'The Lob Slobs', after Jerma talked with a weird voice and explained to STAR\_ that he has to be 'in the mood' for the video and STAR\_, Jerma then imitated a typical shipper's reaction in the comments section:
        
        **Jerma:** Hey, did you see that top comment? Jerma wants to be in the mood for STAR\_ mwuh mwuh mwuh-
        
-   _Linus Tech Tips_: In "The Fatal Flaw in HP's Omen 45L broke me":
    
    **Linus:** You will end up with the same great 45L design, just with less HPenis choding it up. I need a sponsor to cleanse my palate.
    
-   _Marik Plays Bloodlines_: Happens very often to Marik. They are usually accompanied by the sound of Bakura bursting into laughter in the background. Marik rarely gets it.
    
    **Marik:** This isn't the first time I've shot in a guy's face!  
    **Bakura:** _\[dies of laughter\]_  
    **Marik:** Why are you in such a giggly mood, Bakura?
    
-   The Nostalgia Critic does this in his Old vs. New for _The Karate Kid_ with the line: "What's the better movie that everybody wax off to? That sounded really bad."
-   _Outside Xbox:_ On "Show of the Weekend" for 26 January 2019, Mike and Luke are talking about decluttering, and the idea that one should get rid of everythat does not "spark joy." Mike is not keen.
    
    **Mike:** Every single bit of my junk sparks joy.
    
-   _RebelTaxi_:
    -   Pan-Pizza did this when describing the lime Raven during his video on the _Teen Titans (2003)_ episode "Nevermore" (which he considers to be Old Shame), and it was later recycled for his review of the show on YouTube.
    -   Pan brought up that Tara Strong, the voice of Raven, threatened to beat him up once. When Pan re-used the joke for his review of the series, he added one extra clip afterwards.
        
        **Tara Strong:** You all should be ashamed for watching this.
        
-   In _Screen Junkies_' "Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's Wedding Surprise!" video, Dwayne Johnson discusses his role to officiate Nick's wedding to his fiancee. What he said was:
    
    **The Rock:** Today I'm going to marry Nick Mundy! _\[Beat\]_ Let me clarify... to his fiancée.
    
-   _Tekking 101_: In his video about Kido in _Bleach_, talks about a Bakudo spell called the "Numbing Finger" and Urahara using it on Rukia. He corrects himself... by phrasing it even worse.
    
    **Tekking101:** So basically Urahara just like, taps Rukia and... that came out wrong, uh, Urahara FINGERS Rukia. Okay, that's better.
    
-   _True Capitalist_: One day, while presumably talking about guns (as he has made numerous references to Texans being allowed to carry concealed guns), Ghost said that "I always walk around here in Texas, with my strap on... uhh well that didn't, that didn't really, that didn't really sound right." As opposed to a "strap-on" by any chance?
-   Karolina Żebrowska: In her "Breaking Down Tall Vampire Lady's Iconic Look" Karolina says _"I did notice a lot of 1930s inspiration and if I was to date her—if I was to date her charact—if I was to assign the character to a particular time period"_

    **Marceline:** Finn, you're like an ant to him.  
    **Finn:** Oh, yeah? Well _this_ ant's about to get in his pants!  
    **Marceline:** _\[raises an eyebrow\]_ What?  
    **Finn:** _\[blushing\]_ Well — you know! Because I'm going to make him uncomfortable while I release those souls!
    
-   _American Dad!_:
    -   One episode has Jeff running off to Burning Man with a brainwashed Francine. Stan suggests that he and his daughter Hayley should date to get back at Jeff/Francine.

    -   In "Rough Trade", Stan is mistakenly arrested for domestic abuse and to get him out of it, Roger pins the blame on a Jerkass co-worker. The cops find Neo-Nazi paraphernalia in his car, and the guy points out that "this is America", so his freedom of speech is protected. However, the head detective is Jewish and has the guy taken to his car, obviously to beat and/or kill him. As the cops drag him off, the Jerkass says "What is this, Nazi Germany?! ...Wait, that would be awesome!"
-   This happens so frequently in _Archer_ that someone, usually Archer, will almost always say "phrasing" whenever it occurs.
    
    **Mallory:** You wanna play me hard?  
    **Sterling:** Phrasing.  
    **Mallory:** Well, then, you better nut up!  
    **Sterling:** Phrasing!  
    **Mallory:** Because I've swallowed just about all I'm going to take from you!  
    **Sterling:** HEY! PHRASING!
    
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ shows:
    -   Non-sexual example from _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
        
        **Zuko:** I want my father to not think I'm worthless.  
        **Iroh:** I'm sure he doesn't! Why would he banish you if he didn't care?  
        _\[Zuko shoots him an angry glare and walks off\]_  
        **Iroh:** ... That came out wrong, didn't it?
        
    -   Book Four of _The Legend of Korra_ provides one of the few instances that this trope is Played for Drama.
        
        **Korra:** _\[to Katara\]_ Of course I'm frustrated! A crazy man poisoned me, and now I can't dress myself, or cook for myself, or-or do anything for myself, and this whole time, my friends have been out helping the world while I'm stuck with you, and you can't even heal me! _\[Beat\]_ That came out wrong.
        
-   The _Beetlejuice_ episode "Mom's Best Friend" had the Ghost With The Most turning into a dog but he can't revert back because of a restrictive collar around his neck. Sweet, innocent Lydia brandishes a pair of scissors and says "I know how to fix it. I'll cut it off!" B.J. shrieks in fright.

Cue Kevin, who retorts that Ben will make many more mistakes as he charges to the rescue. He immediately lampshades that that wasn't the way he meant the words.
-   The _Bojack Horseman_ episode "Ruthie" has Princess Carolyn say this verbatim after referring to her bearded assistant Judah as her "hairy number two".

Timmy then realizes his mistake.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   When Brian tells Lois that a lovestruck Meg made him eat the hair from her (literal) pie, her response is to punch him. He tries to explain, but is only able to say that Stewie had some too, which results in another punch.
    -   Played with in another episode when Peter is teaching Meg how to find a boyfriend. Obviously referencing the idiom "Beating someone off with a stick", Peter says to Meg "Soon you'll be beating off guys with both hands". The audience 'waits for it', but Peter being Peter, he doesn't catch onto what he said.
    -   The same episode does a similar gag with Lois and Chris.
        
        **Lois:** All right, now that we've practiced kissing and cuddling, it's time to practice eating out... at a fancy restaurant!
        
    -   In "Peter's Got Woods", when Brian dates Meg's African-American teacher Shauna and tries to be a kiss-ass to her:
        
        **Brian:** You know, I've always wondered why they named it after James Woods, you know? I mean, there's gotta be somebody more deserving. Like, just, you know, off the top of my head, uh, I don't know, Sidney Poitier, uh, Reggie Jackson, Martin Luther King, uh, you know, those are just three names that come to mind.  
        **Shauna:** Brian, that's a great idea! We should get them to rename the school after Dr. King.  
        **Brian:** You like Dr. King? Because I love Dr. King. I love MLK, man. He's-He's my guy. He's-he's... I mean, I love all black people. You know, I mean, if I... if I could take all the black people in the world, and just, you know, just buy a farm somewhere and, and let them all... Uh, whoa, you know, what? That, uh, actually, that didn't really come out right.
        
    -   In "He's Bla-ack!", Lois and Donna get into a fight, leading Lois to declare that the Griffins will have nothing to do with "that Brown family". Stewie reminds her that what she just said can sound really bad out of context.
-   The pilot to _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_ had a humorous scene where Duchess proposes to Mac's older brother Terrence that they work together, but Terrence is grossed out because he thinks she is coming on to him.

    **Terrence:** Oh, man! I think I'm going to be sick!
    
-   The _G.I. Joe: Renegades_ episode "Dreadnoks Rising" had the sheriff respond to a compliment from his crush by stating that she should see him out of uniform.

-   _Gravity Falls_: In "Soos and the Real Girl", when Soos realizes his crazy virtual ex-girlfriend Giffany has followed him on his date with Melody, he excuses himself with "Could you sit tight? I have to go to the bathroom for a long time... not in a weird way!"

-   _Johnny Bravo_: In the episode "Third Dork From The Sun", when Johnny inadvertently ends up on an alien game show, the bonus round is against an alien with a massive brain in a contest for absorbing thoughts. But when he tries it against Johnny, his head explodes.
    
    **Johnny:** Ha! Maybe next time you try to absorb a person's mind, you'll make sure he _has_ one! Wait, that didn't come out right.
    
-   In the _Justice League Unlimited_ episode "Epilogue", as Amanda Waller explains to Terry how she had his father's reproductive DNA replaced with Bruce Wayne's to make Terry Bruce's son:
    
    _\[flashback shows a shot of the original Batman being bandaged by a paramedic as a technician collects a sample from a bloodstain\]_  
    **Amanda Waller:** Bruce's DNA was easy enough to obtain. He left it all over town.  
    _\[end flashback, Terry raises an eyebrow\]_  
    **Amanda Waller:** Not _remotely_ what I meant.
    
-   In the _Kim Possible_ episode "Ill-Suited", Ron steals Kim's battlesuit and uses it to cheat his way into the position of star quarterback of the football team out of fear that Kim would dump him for a jock (based in part on misunderstanding a conversation he overheard). This is revealed when Professor Dementor uses a remote device to take control of the suit, whilst Ron is still in it. He attempts to explain his position... poorly at first (whilst being controlled to fight Kim).
    
    **Kim:** You cheated your way onto the football team!  
    **Ron:** Yeah, but that was just a perk. I was really trying to cheat on _you_... _\[notices Kim's angrier expression\]_ —For you! To win you!
    
-   Inverted in a _King of the Hill_ episode where Dale needs the help of a very attractive woman to exterminate a flock of pigeons that have infested the alley:

-   _The Loud House_: In the episode "Pipe Dreams", after Mr. Loud installs tons of security measures to keep the kids from entering the secret bathroom he and Mrs. Loud build for themselves, and also a mechanism to trap them inside if they do manage to get in, Mrs. Loud cheers "We'll catch them with their pants down". She then realizes how that can be interpreted considering it involves a bathroom and quickly states it's just a metaphor.
-   _The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack_: In "Oh, You Animal", Bubbie attempts to explain about her and Flapjack:
    
    **Bubbie:** He doesn't live _with_ me. He lives _inside_ me. _(pause)_ My mouth! He lives inside my mouth! _(pause)_ That sounds weirder than it is.
    
-   _Rick and Morty_: When Rick invents glasses that allow the wearer to view alternate realities, Beth and Jerry learn that their alternate lives where Summer was never born are far more glamorous and interesting than the ones where she was, including their current lives. When Summer expresses distress at the revelation, Beth explains that in the other lives "since you were never born, we \[Beth and Jerry\] were free to live our dreams. That sounded wrong, that sounded very wrong!".
-   The title character of _Ruby Gloom_, shortly before a major public appearance, gets what's supposed to be a motivational speech from her friend Misery. It doesn't help that Misery gets so worked up over the speech that she's practically shouting by the end of it.
    
    **Misery:** Oh, yeah — don't worry about failing, even though you only have this one day to get it right and if you mess it up you'll never be invited back ever... that didn't come out right. See you there.
    
-   A subversion in an episode of _Sealab 2021_. Marco leaves some tamales outside Quinn's door and tells Debbie that they should leave without bothering him because he'll probably be "busy with that hooker for awhile." Cue Debbie's outraged "WHAT?! A HOOKER?!" and several minutes of people going "Uh-oh!" Finally:
    
    **Debbie:** I can't believe he’s with a hooker!  
    **Marco:** No, no! He's watching _T.J. Hooker_.  
    **Debbie:** I thought you said he was with a hooker.  
    **Marco:** No, he's watching _TJ Hooker_. On television.  
    **Marco:** _\[laughs\]_  
    **Debbie:** _\[laughs\]_  
    **Marco:** _\[laughs\]_  
    **Debbie:** _\[laughs\]_  
    **Marco:** _\[laughs\]_ ...with a prostitute.  
    **Debbie:** WHAT!?!
    
-   _The Simpsons_: In "Last Exit to Springfield", Mr. Burns tries to bribe Homer, who has recently become the union leader. It doesn't work out quite right due to his choice of words:
    
    **Mr. Burns:** We don't have to be adversaries, Homer. We both want a fair union contract.  
    **Homer:** _\[thinking\]_ Why is Mr. Burns being so nice to me?  
    **Mr. Burns:** And if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.  
    **Homer:** _\[thinking\]_ Wait a minute. Is he coming on to me?  
    **Mr. Burns:** I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what's the harm?  
    **Homer:** _\[thinking\]_ My God! He _is_ coming on to me!  
    **Mr. Burns:** After all, negotiations make strange bedfellows. _\[chuckles, then winks at Homer\]_  
    **Homer:** _\[thinking\]_ Aaaaagggh! _\[out loud\]_ Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm flattered, maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no!
    
-   In the _Sonic Boom_ episode "Blue With Envy", this exchange occurs between Swifty the Shrew and Tails when Sonic challenges the former to a race to see who's the fastest:
    
    **Swifty:** Man, can you believe that guy? What a lameoid!  
    **Tails:** That lameoid is my best friend! That didn't come out right.
    
    -   In another episode, "Fortress of Squalitude", where Eggman invites Amy to help him decorate his lair and the others try to disuade her:
        
        **Amy**: Is it so hard to believe Eggman might actually respect my talents?
        
        **Sonic**: Well, yeah! Wait, that came out wrong...
        
-   _South Park_ both subverts and plays straight. For example:
    
    **Cartman's mom:** _\[rings up Kyle's mom\]_ Uhm, Sheila? I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently, your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.  
    **Kyle's mom:** ... ... excuse me?
    
-   _Star Trek: Lower Decks_:
    -   "No Small Parts": An argument between Mariner and Ransom about whether he is too hard on her immediately goes south in exactly the way that you'd think. Bonus points for Ransom trying to unknot his use of the word in front of Freeman, Mariner's _mother_. For the remainder of the conversation, he holds a PADD in front of his crotch.
        
        **Ransom:** From now on, I'll make sure to give you special attention.  
        **Freeman:** No! Be as hard on her as you always are!  
        **Mariner:** Yeah, be hard on me!  
        **Ransom:** I'm only hard on you when you make me hard! I mean I'm— I'm not hard right now! I mean I could— I could get hard, if I wanted to, but I'm not hard right now. I'm so sorry! You're both great!

-   Owen of _Total Drama_ has done this repeatedly.

-   During a party to celebrate Team Voltron's first victory in _Voltron: Legendary Defender_, Princess Allura tries to bond with Pidge, bringing up the fact that they've both lost their fathers to the Galra to presumably coax her into talking about being in the midst of a Sweet Polly Oliver. Pidge replies "Yeah but I'm going to get mine back." (which is true as her father is merely missing while Allura's has been dead for 1,000 years) before looking horrified.
-   _Xiaolin Showdown_: When Jack Spicer hears that the good guys don't have a plan:

-   _Young Justice (2010)_
    -   A serious one occurs in "Homefront". Robin and Artemis are looking at the security footage to find out what ambushed their friends, only for all four cameras to be wiped out while recording the ambush.
        
        **Robin:** That's it. All four are dead.  
        _\[Artemis looks at him in horror\]_  
        **Robin:** _\[hurriedly\]_ The cameras. I meant the cameras.
        
    -   A more humorous version happens in "Humanity".
        
        **Zatanna:** Tornado never knew _my_ moves!  
        **Robin:** And I bet you've got some good ones!  
        _\[Beat\]_  
        **Robin:** Whoa! Sorry, that may have come off a little too Wally.  
        **Zatanna:** I don't mind.
        

    Real Life 

-   Comedians Laurel and Hardy would create foreign language versions of their films by reshooting scenes while reading cue cards containing phonetic translations of their English scripts. When watching a film with a Spanish speaking audience, the duo was surprised when the audience burst out in laughter at what was supposed to be a mundane line. Stan Laurel inquired about it and was delighted to learn that an unintentional mispronunciation had transformed his line into a crude joke.
-   This pastor's blooper reminds us all of the importance of good enunciation while preaching.
    
    **Preacher:** Lot chose to go pinch his tits— excuse me... um, "pitch his tents" is what I said, and you heard nothing else here, this is Church! \[_laughter from the congregation_\]
    
-   The BBC is a state-funded broadcaster obliged to be even-handed in politics. This certainly precludes calling Members Of Parliment rude names. Which makes this occasion of James Naughtie accidentally making the worst spoonerism of "Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt", here pronounced with an extra C rather amusing. Note also the "coughing fit" that follows.
-   British cricket commentator Brian Johnston was well known for generating highly quotable gaffes, including the often quoted "The bowler's Holding, the batsman's Willey". His fit of giggles when co-commentator Jonathan Agnew's said "He just didn't quite get his leg over"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  when Ian Botham was given out after accidentally knocking over the wicket while batting, was voted the favourite moment of sports commentary by BBC Radio 5 listeners.
-   iPhone's Autocorrection function can cause... amusing effects on your text messages.<small>◊</small> Android doesn't seem to do much better, though. There's an entire website dedicated to this.
-   People with Asperger Syndrome. Because they are much more socially naïve than most people, they tend to fall into this while talking. It may take longer for them to realize it, too, because they often have trouble reading others' facial expressions—in fact, unless there's a more obvious cue (such as someone bursting out laughing), they may not realize their mistake at all, and even then they may not know what, exactly, the problem is.
-   It's possible to trip someone up in saying this or "putting words in their mouth" so to speak if they're not focusing on what you are saying:
    
    **Guy 1:** Don't worry. I'm the man!  
    **Guy 2:** You the man.  
    **Guy 1:** I'm the man.  
    **Guy 2:** You're a pedophile.  
    **Guy 1:** TO THE CORE! (Beat) Wait, WHAT??!
    
-   There was one caused by badly translated supertitles during a performance of _Tosca_. Tosca ordered her lover to change the eyes of a Madonna he was painting from blue like his model's to dark like Tosca's. The supertitles translated the line as "Give her black eyes" and the audience burst out laughing. This caused the soprano playing Tosca to storm off the stage in rage.
-   During Rooster Teeth's RTX 2015 panel for _RWBY_, the creators were showing off some merchandise, ending with the reveal of the Volume 3 poster. Wanting to show the detail of the poster to the audience, Miles Luna and Kerry Shawcross fight with the Windows Photos program they're using before Kerry finds the zoom option. Since the program zooms in on the center of whatever it looks like and the poster central figure is main heroine Ruby Rose, it unfortunately zooms in on her crotch and hips, sending Miles, Kerry and the audience into hysterics and Lindsay Jones, Ruby's voice actress, to admonish them before joking around herself.

-   TV news reports, morning shows, etc can be prey to this, especially when the anchors try to improvise or banter.
-   An urban legend tells of a woman pulled over for speeding. She offers to buy some tickets to the policeman's ball, but the cop responds with "Sorry ma'am, state policemen don't have balls." After realizing what he said, he tears up the ticket and walks away rather than have to face her in traffic court.
-   A non-sexual example in this post on Reddit, in which the poster explains that they've mostly quit smoking cigarettes, but sometimes they do give into temptation. Or, as they put it, "sometimes I do crack." Responses pounce on it immediately, but the original poster was evidently clueless.
-   Just a few months after the Boston Marathon bombing, The Hives played in the city. Frontman Pelle Almqvist decided to interact with the appreciative crowd... in a way that didn't sit well with the recent tragedy: “This song’s for everyone in Boston. It’s about stuff blowing up. It’s called 'Tick, Tick, Boom'.” The following day, the band had to send an apology, with Almqvist stating the bombing "never once crossed my mind while on stage, and of course it should have."
-   Travelling Renaissance Faire performer Jacques Ze Whipper regularly takes requests at his shows, and when someone suggested "All The Single Ladies" by Beyoncé, Jacques says "Okay, I will do 'All The Single Ladies'," and _instantly_ realizes what came out of his mouth. When all the women in the audience cheer, he says "The song, people! The song!"
-   In 2017 during a press conference, a reporter tried to ask Philadelphia Eagles coach Doug Pederson about his quarterback Carson Wentz' meteoric ascent and whether it might be concerning to see a young quarterback elevate so quickly (as this can sometimes result in a One-Hit Wonder and regression). Unfotunately, the reporter ended up asking Pederson about whether he was worried about a "premature explosion". Pederson was unable to keep a straight face at that one.
