"Do I have something on my face?"

_Honestly i kind of just want to see his skull like is it, solid where there would be eyes and a nose._

— _gameranx_

The human brain is hardwired to recognize faces. Humans will even see faces where there are none, such as The Man in the Moon. So there is something very disturbing about a person without a face. Meet The Blank.

The Blank is a humanoid character with no face. Perhaps it is a disguise to unsettle opponents. Perhaps they were a victim of some entity that steals faces, a common form of Transformation Horror. Or perhaps they're just that good at poker. How the character is able to see, breathe and talk without eyes, a nose or a mouth is not likely to be resolved — although robots, aliens and monsters might have an easier time justifying this.

While The Noseless or No Mouth characters often have part-time facial features with Sudden Anatomy, this seems to happen less often with The Blank. Presumably, The Blank is generally done for dramatic impact, while those others are sometimes simply for creator convenience.

Not to be confused with The Faceless, which is where a character's face is hidden from view rather than nonexistent. Compare Faceless Eye and Eyeless Face. The Nondescript might as well not have a face, given how tough theirs is to recall. See also Malevolent Masked Men and its extra-blank subtrope White Mask of Doom.

Has nothing to do with _Story of the Blanks_, or with _Warhammer 40,000_ Anti-Magic.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Even though facial features, especially the eyes (compare Eyeless Face), are crucial to convey emotions, it is a common trope in manga and anime to make use of blank faces to also convey emotions. Such emotions could be something like a feeling of inadequacy, a loss for words, a complete void in one's mind or heart, or an aura of uncertainty, mystique, rage, or coolness. The blank face could be completely blank, or still retain the nose, the mouth or the eyebrows, but mostly it lacks the eyes. One common way to justify the blank face is to use highly contrasting shadows regardless of the lighting conditions, especially if a character has a sharp, defined brow ridge, or long bangs. More often than not, the character's bangs, which normally magically stay clear from the eyes or the brows, are deliberately extended to cover the eyes when a blank face is needed. In certain pornographic works where the female character's physique and expressions are the focus, especially during sex scenes, the male character, apart from having no voice-over or even lines, may have no eyes whatsoever either.
-   The Pict in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ are an entire species of faceless aliens.
-   A one-shot character's face was not drawn for most of the chapter in _Chibisan Date_.
-   _Doraemon_ had a gadget who erases faces used in one episode, where the faces are then redrawn with a special gadget pen. Nobita tried using this gadget to make himself more "handsome" to impress Shizuka (getting an artist friend of his to sketch his new face) but inevitably Gian and Suneo found out about it. Eventually, the three of them decide, screw that, they'll have the artist redraw from scratch… but alas, said artist broke his drawing arm in an accident, which Nobita and gang doesn't find out until _after_ erasing all their faces.
-   Canti from _FLCL_ has a TV for a head. However, he expresses emotions well enough with gestures.
-   Truth from _Fullmetal Alchemist_ is blank all over, save when his face is contorting into a sadistic grin, or when some poor idiot is about to lose a chunk of himself to it.
-   _Inuyasha_:
    -   One of Naraku's incarnations starts off this way, until he starts stealing people's faces (leaving them faceless and dead).
    -   There is also the Un-Mother in the episode when Sesshomaru first appears, a faceless woman who impersonates Inuyasha's mother in an attempt to steal his soul.
-   Symbolic example in _Magi: Labyrinth of Magic:_ when Alibaba meets his father, the King of Balbadd, his face (and hands) are shown as blank darkness. Later, on his deathbed, Alibaba finally asks the King if he ever really loved Alibaba's mother; when he confirms that he did, his face is suddenly revealed.
-   In _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_, practically every OZ Mobile Suit has a face dominated by a flat, square camera sensor. This takes on another dimension later in the series, when the Mobile Dolls are introduced.
-   In _The Promised Neverland_, Queen Legravalima's final form has a head with no discernable face. In addition to it being incredibly creepy, especially coupled with her incredibly calm and relaxed posture and way of speaking, this form gives her a _very_ rapid Healing Factor that covers her entire body—the only surefire way to kill a demon is to Go for the Eye—meaning she has no weaknesses.
-   _Rurouni Kenshin_: Like Decoy Octopus, one Shinomori Aoshi's Ninja Elite Mook named Hanya more or less destroyed his own face so that he can be a Master of Disguise.
-   _Queen Millennia_: A Millennial Thief who kidnaps Hajime has a solid round black head which turns out to be a mask Selene wears. In later appearances the face at least has a shape.
-   In _Sailor Moon_, one makeup-themed Monster of the Week accidentally erased her own face. She was trying to draw it back with eyebrow pencil on when Sailor Moon zapped her.
-   In the first season OP of _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_, female students are shown with facial features blanked out and various kanji written on them.
-   _School Rumble_: "_WHEN DID THIS FACELESS MOB OF EXTRAS START CHASING ME!?"_
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: One of the defining traits of the ganmen robots is that they have large faces. Thus, when the enemy Anti-Spiral robots show up, the Gurren Brigade are visibly disturbed that _they don't have faces._
-   In _I Think Our Son Is Gay_, this trope is used twice to indicate a _hypothetical_ person as Tomoko thinks about something. In Chapter 18, it's Daigo's hypothetical girlfriend when the potential of Incompatible Orientation is discussed, and the second time is in Chapter 40, when Tomoko admits she considered what is a "happy family" for her children at one point, this appears as Hiroki's hypothetical wife.

    Arts 

-   Giorgio de Chirico made spooky use of featureless mannequins in several of his paintings, including "The Disquieting Muses."
-   Several sculptures by Kevin Francis Gray are of metallic human figures with their faces hidden by waves of what might be cloth, or might simply not have faces at all. In particular, "Face Off", "Pearly Girl & Pearly Boy", and "Hold Tight" give off this impression.
-   René Magritte used faceless, suited figures in many of his paintings as well. However, "Son of Man" is not an example, as though the subject may appear, at first glance, to be faceless, if you look closely you can see a single eyebrow and part of an eye.
-   _The Scream_: The central character has no hair, nose, eyebrows, or ears, further accentuating the eerie sensation of its excruciating and distorted expression. The two figures in the background also don't have distinguishable features.
-   Venus of Willendorf has no visible face. While her breasts and her vagina is quite detailed, her head is covered in small bumps that can be seen as hair hanging in her face or as artistic license.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   A very early story (_Detective Comics_ #34, 1939) features a man whose face has been erased by the villain. Weirdly he could still speak and there is no indication in the story that the condition is reversible. Hilariously, he hardly even seems to care. He scares Bruce Wayne in the first few panels, but both men shrug it off like he just stepped on his foot or something.
    -   Another one-shot Batman villain is Dr. No-Face. No prizes for guessing what his gimmick is.
    -   Particularly disturbing is another No-Face (no relation to the guy above) appearing in _Battle for the Cowl: Arkham Asylum_, where he tops off an already creepy comic by painting his face to look like the Joker. _Why_ he has no face is even more disturbing; he glued a ceremonial mask on (long story) and his father _tore it off_ when he saw him wearing it. (It later turns out, however, that he doesn't exist, and Jeremiah Arkham has been hallucinating all of his "special" patients. Whether that makes him _more_ or _less_ disturbing is another question...)
-   In the original series of _Batman and the Outsiders_, one storyline had Halo having a recurring nightmare where her face was pulled off like a mask, revealing her to be faceless underneath.
-   _Chick Tracts_ portray God as this.
-   In _Crisis on Infinite Earths_, the Anti-Monitor briefly causes the Psycho-Pirate to lose his face in order to bring him to submission.
-   The _Doctor Who Magazine_ strip gives us Shayde, whose head is a featureless black sphere.
    -   And the faceless children from "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night".
    -   A _Doctor Whoa_ strip speculated that the reason for the Tenth Doctor's regeneration would be having his face worn away from too much kissing.
-   During Grant Morrison's run of _Doom Patrol_, Flex Mentallo describes a number of his former teammates in one issue. Among them is the Fact, whose appearance and name are a clear homage to/parody of The Question. The Fact goes on to feature (sort of) in Flex's own miniseries.
-   John Doe, the Generic Man, a villain from DC Comics' _The Heckler_, is not just blank-faced, his body is an outline with a plain white interior. His face sometimes has a description of his emotions where the mouth should be. He can turn anything he touches equally featureless (but labeled).
-   Johnny Sorrow, a villain from _Justice Society of America_, has no human face... but pull aside his mask and you die.
-   The demon Trifoms in _Lori Lovecraft: The Big Comeback_ has no features on his head (just some vague protuberances), but eyes and a Belly Mouth on his torso.
-   The android Zero from _New Mutants_ and other books in the Marvel Universe.
-   Megaman from the _Nova_ series in the Marvel Universe.
-   The Global Peace Agents in _O.M.A.C._ use masks to make themselves appear blank-faced. In _Final Crisis_, the new Question, Renee Montoya, appears to become the first Global Peace Agent. The implication is that the blank-face masks worn by all Peace Agents in O.M.A.C.'s future are based on the Question's mask (and probably use a "later generation" of the same technology).
-   The Question from The DCU could be considered the Trope Codifier. It's usually a mask, but he likes giving people absurd explanations when they ask about it.
-   Minor Marvel Comics villain Ruby Thursday (first appearing in _The Defenders_) is a sexy Mad Scientist with a shape-shifting blob of red plastic for a head; its resting state is a featureless sphere. The closest she ever gets to having a face is a pair of glowing "eye" dots that only appear when she needs to indicate which direction she's looking.
-   A Marvel-published issue of _Scooby-Doo_ dealt with a faceless phantom trying to scare an inventor into giving up his plans for a teleportation device. Turns out the phantom, when unmasked, was a schmuck who feared teleportation devices would render airlines obsolete and he wouldn't be able to see the stewardesses. And the clincher was the inventor's teleportation device was phony. Shaggy puts on the featureless mask and cracks an obvious joke:
    
    **Shaggy:** That man tricked us. I have lost face.  
    **Scooby:** Ouch!
    
-   The Awesome Android from _Fantastic Four_ is an artificial person with a blank grey cube for a head. He can't talk, and when he appears working in a law firm in the pages of _She-Hulk_, he uses a chalkboard to communicate. He later upgrades to a modern tablet device that connects to his CPU via Wi-Fi; one wonders why he continued to communicate via text at that point, rather than acquiring a text-to-voice application.
-   The Chameleon from _Spider-Man_ has no face of his own when not impersonating someone.
-   One alien scheme in _Strikeforce: Morituri_ involved an alien "healer" plant, which killed people by making their skin overgrow their mouth and nostrils, leaving the faces of their corpses covered only with skin.
-   _The Tomb of Dracula_:
    -   The Faceless Fiend can transfer features or body parts from others onto his featureless form, leaving blank flesh on his victim in its place. This also somehow kills his victims.
    -   The Dimensional Man, a minor villain in the Marvel Universe created by Steve Ditko, who also created The Question.
-   While most of them have some kind of recognizable humanoid features, a fair few Transformers essentially have _no_ facial features beyond a single glowing eye, such as Whirl (who at least benefits from an Expressive Mask) and Shockwave; the IDW comics explained this as being a form of deliberate mutilation used as punishment. Somehow, a more traditionally Blank Transformer face can become profoundly disturbing.
    -   Other characters have a visor-and-faceplate arrangement, such as Chromedome, Tailgate and Rewind, which gives the general outline of eyes but no other details (although Expressive Mask is sometimes in place, and Tailgate starts venting energy while under stress that gives the impression of tears). It's confirmed that this _usually_ means a lack of a traditional mouth, since the lack of lips means that Chromedome has been trying and failing to make a dismissive "pfft" noise for _four million years_.
-   Rorschach, the Captain Ersatz of The Question in _Watchmen_, a particularly weird example because of the shifting patterns of his mask. It seems like you should be able to project facial expressions onto it, but you can't.
-   There was a group of faceless people inhabiting a jungle valley in Carl Barks's Uncle Scrooge story named _The Many Faces of Magica de Spell_.
-   The original _West Coast Avengers_ miniseries features a villain who _calls_ himself "The Blank" (picking it up from a bystander in the bank he's robbing at the time), a petty thief with nothing but a pistol and a stolen force field belt that makes him bulletproof, hard to grab, and makes his entire body look like a light gray silhouette when active. After escaping the newly-formed team in their first encounter, he entirely sensibly decides that he is badly outclassed against "real" superheroes and should leave town ASAP — unfortunately for him, other events prevent him from doing so, leading to his eventual apparent Disney Villain Death.
-   In one of the early issues of _W.I.T.C.H._, Will dreams that she's woken and looked in the mirror to find that she has no face! Then she tries to draw one on with a black marker before being woken up.
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 5: When Deimos and Phobos steal the soul of Veronica Cale's daughter, she's left with no facial features. Luckily, she doesn't need to eat or breathe in this state, but she's left entirely unresponsive, including not aging alongside the other kids her age.
-   The _X-Statix_ villain Mr. Code has a Question\-style featureless mask with a barcode printed on it.
-   Yor, the Faceless Hunter from Saturn, an obscure DC Comics space villain best known for his appearance on _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_. His people have evolved all their facial features away; their ears expanded and took in visual information, they smelled with their skin and also photosynthesized through it while developing telepathy for communication.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Dick Tracy_: The Blank, a.k.a. Frankie "Faceless" Redrum, considered to be the first true supervillain that Dick Tracy fought, was a disfigured criminal who hid his hog-like face behind a featureless, flesh-colored cloth mask attached to his face. In the _Dick Tracy_ live-action film, in which the character is downgraded/retrofitted as a generic vigilante alter ego of Femme Fatale Breathless Mahoney (conceived mainly to eliminate Big Boy Caprice's gang so that she can have Dick Tracy), the mask is changed to a generic stocking mask and Mahoney simply talking in a husky voice.
    -   Interestingly, even though Redrum hardly appeared in the strip at all, the Blank became one of Tracy's most intriguing and iconic foes — so much so that, when plans were first made in the 1980s to do a movie version, the Blank was the very first villain that the screenwriters thought to include.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ fic _The Avatar's Love_ by Rain And Roses, Aang has his face stolen by Koh. Katara then has several nightmares throughout the story, most of which end with her uncovering Aang's face only to reveal that it's completely blank.
-   Slender Man fic _By the Fire's Light_ features the tall, dark, and faceless Slender Man as the antagonist.
-   In _Child of the Storm_, The Slender Men have blank white mask like faces. Somehow, they can still shriek. And yes, _men_. There are thousands of them and for added Nightmare Fuel, they can shapeshift, they can fly, they travel by shadows, they're mercenaries from the Winter Court and implied to be the children of something _even worse_.
-   The Face is a comic book parody character used in short stories of comic book fan fiction by Ben del Mundo. He was created on November 20, 2004, and was inspired by the DC Comics character, the Question. His attire consists of a costume of gray, complete with trenchcoat, fedora, pants, and gloves. In addition he wears a faceless mask in order "to strike fear into the hearts of his enemies" and uses his journalistic investigative skills to solve crimes.
-   In _Five Minutes to Save the World_ Hermione used human experimentation to create supposed super-soldiers known as the Faceless. As a punishment by magic for going against the natural order of things, every one of them is _literally_ faceless.
-   From The Fog: One of the alternate skins that Herobrine may use is the default skin completely devoid of facial features.
-   In _The Loud House_ fanfic _The Nightmare House_, Lola's nightmare involves parts of her face falling off until she has no face.

-   In the long _Final Fantasy VII_ fic _Sink to the Bottom With You_, our heroes face up against faceless soldiers, among other similar horrors cooked up by Hojo and hiding out in the Midgar Sewers.
-   _Sword Art Online Abridged_ has a temporary example in Episode 15, when Leafa refuses to believe that Kirito's mission to rescue Asuna isn't some sort of prank at her expense, and Yui demonstrates just what she can do with her admin privileges - giving Leafa several seconds to try to scream when her eyes, nose and mouth are deleted from her avatar.

    Films — Animation 

-   Radio from _The Brave Little Toaster_, who for some reason, unlike all of the other appliance characters in the film, actually lacked a face.
-   _The LEGO Movie_: President Business rubs off Good Cop's face so Bad Cop won't be hindered by his morality. Luckily, Bad Cop later crudely restores it with a marker upon his Heel–Face Turn.
-   Just pick any of _The Mind's Eye_ series, and you're guaranteed to find at least one humanoid figure lacking a face and, much more frequently, anatomy. One submission in the first in the series even goes as far as to lack the _blank itself_, reducing the character's head to a thin ring.
-   The Princesses Rhyme and Reason in the Chuck Jones animated version of _The Phantom Tollbooth_, as well as the Terrible Trivium, as in the literature version mentioned below.

    Films — Live-Action

-   The killer in _The Boogeyman (1980)_ is described as this, though he's really just a guy with stocking over his head.
-   In _The Brothers Grimm_, one of the girls loses her face to a mud baby. You might forget it for a time.

-   In _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_, when Joel escapes with the memory of his ex-girlfriend into an already-erased memory, the characters he sees are distorted and have no faces. In another scene, he confronts the memory of his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend (who, coincidentally, is erasing his memories) he forcibly turns him around, but since he's only ever seen him from behind all he gets is the back of his head again.
-   _Faust: Love of the Damned_: Jade has childhood nightmares about a faceless man who raped her that she called "Smooth Man".
-   _The Intruders_ has a nasty one named Hollow Face, a sort of storybook monster who steals children's faces.
-   The trope was subverted in the film adaptation of _Johnny Got His Gun_; makers of the film included extensive dream/fantasy sequences with actor Timothy Bottoms to get around the fact that his character spends the entire novel with a blank, box-shaped mask over his completely destroyed face.
-   The faceless dancer from _Legend (1985)_.
-   Xayide in _The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter_ starts out this way. Then she puts her face on. Watch it here.
-   Will Turner finds a faceless corpse in _Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest_. The man had his face sucked off by the tentacles of the Kraken, an event Gibbs mentioned earlier in the film. (Just in case you needed reminding, this is from the same director as _The Ring_...)
-   _Revenge of the Sith_: A rare good example are the Kallidahin, who harbor Obi-Wan, Bail Organa, and Yoda after the two Jedi return from their duels, as well as trying to save Padme.
-   A soldier in _Saving Private Ryan_ gets his face blown off during Omaha Beach, though that's actually quite distinctive: people would readily be able to recognise that.
-   A particularly screwed up<small>◊</small> instance in the slasher film _Smiley_.
-   The reflective robots guarding the bomb on the train in _Sucker Punch_.

-   In the _Give Yourself Goosebumps_ book _Welcome to the Wicked Wax Museum_, one of the possible endings was that your face gets stolen, and the front of your head only has smooth, blank wax where it used to be.

    Literature 

-   In _Alien in a Small Town,_ Indira has felt self-conscious and "stared at" all her life. She finds it enormously comforting that her alien friend is a good listener and literally does not have a face.
-   In _The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant_, the Sandgorgons have no facial features.
-   The protagonist of Alfred Bester's _The Demolished Man_ is haunted in his nightmares by The Man With No Face (Looming. Silent.) Diagnosed as his subconscious denial of his business rival as his father.
-   The SF novel _Eudeamon_ by Erika Moak uses this trope. An earlier version of it can be found online here. Suffice it to say, much of this story qualifies as horror, even though technically it is a _love story_.
-   In Author Mary SanGiovanni's books _Found You_ and _The Hollower_ the big bad is a faceless creature in a fedora hat and trench coat who uses bogyman tactics to break you so he can feast on your fear and despair.
-   In Clive Barker's _The Hellbound Heart_ (which would become _Hellraiser_), the Engineer (a fifth cenobite known by reputation by Frank at the story's beginning), doesn't show up until the end. This _may_ be a questionable example if he was only given human shape by virtue of occupying Julia's wedding dress.
-   Zig-zagged with The Big Bad of James Stoddard's fantasy novel, _The High House_. His head just appears as a white roundish mass with no features. However, occasionally, either his Slasher Smile mouth or his eyes will be visible on it. When the hero kills him at the end, all his features become visible and he looks just like an ordinary human being.
-   In one of _The Indian in the Cupboard_ books, Omri's father is accidentally sent back in time to inhabit a faceless Iroquois Indian corn doll. He becomes a miniature of his human self, with a flesh-and-bone face, but no features. Doubles as And I Must Scream.
-   _Johnny Got His Gun_ could be said to be a pioneer of this trope going into full-blown horror territory, with the novel's main character (who lost his arms, legs, and face in an explosion during World War I) spending the entire novel with a featureless box-shaped mask covering up the face portion of his caved-in skull. It also gets points for coming up with a way for someone without a face to communicate in a realistic fashion (he uses Morse Code).
-   From _The King in Yellow_, the Stranger in Pallid Mask aka the Phantom of Truth, whose equivalent haunts the protagonists in one of the short stories. He is a living corpse whose face is white smooth like a mask. The Stranger might also be Hastur "the King in Yellow" of the Cthulhu Mythos.
-   In _The King of the Swords_ by Michael Moorcock, Corum, an incarnation of the Eternal Champion has to face god of Chaos "Mabelode the Faceless" (or perhaps "Mabelrode").
-   H. P. Lovecraft's nightgaunts.
-   Indirectly used in Terry Pratchett's _Men at Arms_, when Carrot offers to reveal the face of a killer to a clown. Surrounded by painted eggs which document the make-up worn by professional clowns, he shows the witness an unpainted egg. As the Fools' Guild indoctrinates clowns to think of their make-up as their _real_ face, the clown retreats in horror from the "faceless" egg. In truth, Carrot has deduced that the murderer isn't a clown at all.
-   One of the titular _Midnight’s Children_ has this power. Downplayed in that he does still have eyes (of a sort) and a mouth-like hole.
-   Simon R. Green's _Nightside_ series has the Harrowing, unstoppable constructs with no faces, who are a constant source of terror to John Taylor throughout the series.
-   In _Paradox Bound_, the Faceless Men have been around since the founding of the US, tasked with protecting American history from accidental or intentional changes by people “skidding” across history. They also protect the Dream, an extremely powerful artifact that can be used to remake the country to a single person's desires. When people are recruited by the Faceless Men, they undergo surgery that removes their facial features and grafts the feeling of certainty into them, as well as the ability to move through history at will. Certainty allows them to know exactly what is around them up to a certain range, which is how they are perfectly fine without eyes. It also makes them very hard to kill, as they can calculate the precise way to position themselves to make bullets bounce off their bones harmlessly at just the right angle.
-   The Terrible Trivium<small>◊</small> in _The Phantom Tollbooth_.
-   In Tanya Huff's _The Silvered_, the protagonist tries to practice healing magic on an injured rabbit. To her horror, when she tries to close up the holes in its skin, she closes up _everything_—mouth, ears, and nose. This winds up being how she kills the Big Bad, who has protections from everything except healing magic.
-   In _The Stand_, people see Randall Flagg in their dreams with a black hole for a face, and many assume that's what he'll look like in person. Thus, one of his many nicknames is The Man with No Face. When they do meet him, he appears normal enough... usually... but since he's a Humanoid Abomination, it's hard to say what he truly looks like.
-   The E.F. Benson story _The Step_ features this.
-   The _Tales to Give You Goosebumps_ short story "Broken Dolls" features a creepy old woman who crafts dolls, but doesn't include facial features on her creations. It is later revealed that she uses a type of magical gel (referred to as "dolly jelly" by the protagonist's younger brother) which not only robs the unfortunate victims of their faces, which then end up on the specific doll, but their souls apparently become trapped in the dolls, too.
-   In _Those That Wake_, the man in the suit is described as being hard to describe, with a lack of facial or clothing features but definite familiarity.
-   _Till We Have Faces_: Orual's favorite In-Universe bit of Wild Mass Guessing about her veil is that she wears it to hide a vast emptiness where her face would be. This theory in particular helps her intimidate wily politicians and brave soldiers into ceding to her demands.
-   In the third _Warrior Cats_ book, Fireheart has a nightmare of a faceless queen losing her kits.
-   In _Who?_ by Algis Budrys, a scientist kidnapped by the Soviets is returned to the West as a cyborg after suffering severe injuries during his kidnapping. His face is just a blank metal mask, one arm is mechanical and the other might be a transplant, so how do the authorities know if he really is the scientist or a well-briefed spy impersonating him?
-   _Vorkosigan Saga_: Elli Quinn becomes this in _The Warrior's Apprentice_ when she takes a plasma burn to the face. Fortunately, plastic surgery does wonders in the future.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Parodied somewhat on _30 Rock_. On a show within a show episode, we see a manager whose face appeared to be blurred for the camera, but we learn he has "Blurry Face Syndrome".
-   Tom has a vision of Maia sans face in _The 4400_. The combination of The Blank and a Creepy Child pushed this scene into fearsome overdrive. Also, he can't see her face is because she's just been the subject of a Ret-Gone via Time Travel, making the whole thing _that much worse_.
-   In an episode of _Akumuchan_, Ayami has a dream where one of her students is completely face-less. To remedy this, one of the other students attempts to draw a face on him so that he can be "normal".
-   The true forms of the aliens in the _Are You Afraid of the Dark?_ episode "The Tale of the Thirteenth Floor"; in fact, the protagonist turns out to be one too at the end.
    -   The people who had their faces stolen in "The Tale of Many Faces". She couldn't take away their personalities, though. Not true blankness, actually.
-   _The Avengers (1960s)_: In "Death's Door", Lord Melford has a nightmare about attending a peace conference where he is greeted at the door by a faceless man. Steed and Emma later discover he had been drugged and the nightmare staged. During the final fight against the bad guys, Emma shows up wearing the costume and mask used to create the faceless man.
-   The Batman parody _Bat Thumb_ had the Villain No-Face, who had no face, and whose evil plot was to disperse the same chemical which caused him to lose his face throughout the city.
-   _Black Mirror_: In "USS Callister", Daly does this to Nanette, and can do much worse at any time. This is a reference to "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream" and a possible Shout-Out to both movie version of "It's a Good Life" and the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Charlie X", where a woman's face is _also_ removed by a misanthropic Manchild with godlike powers.
-   The Bringers on _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ are sort of this, given that they seem expressionless, emotionless and have skin growing over where their eyeballs should be. The show's creators specifically commented that making them look like deformed humans was creepier than most of the other demons they used.
-   The Human Being mascot of Greendale on _Community_, consists of a faceless white nylon bodysuit.
-   _CSI: Cyber_: In "Click Your Poison", the bad guy is laundering money by playing against himself in an on-line poker site. This is represented on-screen by the identical faceless figures sitting around a poker table.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   In "The Masque of Mandragora", Count Federico does a Dramatic Unmask of the astrologer Hieronymous, who is dressed in the mask and robes of his cult, only to get a nasty shock when he finds his face is just a glowing light after absorbing the Mandragora Helix.
    -   All the humans who have their faces stolen by aliens in "The Faceless Ones".
    -   The Raston Warrior Robot from "The Five Doctors".
    -   The Cybermen's killer androids from "Earthshock".
    -   In "The Caves of Androzani", Sharaz Jek uses faceless warrior androids as grunts.
    -   The Wire's victims from "The Idiot's Lantern". The police are under pressure to keep things quiet with the coronation happening, so they're just bagging the victims up and locking them in a Black Site.
    -   The Silence (or Silents) could partially qualify; as they lack most facial features, save for two bulbous eyes, and a slit for a nose.
    -   The Handbots in "The Girl Who Waited", which is commented on by the Doctor, and later lampshaded when Old Amy disarms one of them and keeps it as a pet, she draws a face on it and names it Rory.
    -   "The Name of the Doctor": The Whisper Men, who are minions of the Great Intelligence, could also qualify as such. Aside from a freakish looking mouth, they otherwise completely lack facial features.
-   In _Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights_ all the actors in the "Untitled Street" sketch are given blank faces so they can be as neutral as possible.
-   Blank-ness turns lethal on _Fringe_, when a string of victims' facial features start rapidly growing over, causing death by suffocation. Even a tracheotomy can't save them, as the growing tissue quickly seals any such airholes as fast as they are made.
-   _The Haunting Hour_: In "Scary Mary", chanting Mary's name three times in front of a mirror will summon the Mirror Monster Scary Mary, who will send her three faceless servants through the mirror to drag the summoner back so Mary can steal their face.
-   The Green Man from _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_ wears a faceless spandex bodysuit.
-   In _Kamen Rider Double_, the True Final Boss Utopia Dopant does this to all of Shotaro and Phillip's friends in the penultimate episode, since Phillip's emotional turmoil will accelerate his evil plan. Too bad for him all he really did was trigger one of Shotaro's finest Moments of Awesome.
-   _Leverage_: In "The White Rabbit Job", the team disguise themselves as crash test dummies of the target's employees (It Makes Sense in Context) with blank faces.
-   _Look Around You_ contains a couple examples of this:
    -   In the pilot episode, it is explained that the "queen" of a calcium molecule escaping makes the entire molecule unstable and can lead to the dreaded "Helvetica Scenario". What exactly happens is unclear, but the end result is the victim losing their face. Clip
    -   In the last episode of Series 2, Prince Charles ends up looking faceless after Leonard Hatred sprays him with his "Psilence" liquid skin. (It's not explained how His Royal Highness is able to breathe after this happens, but he seems to manage.)
-   Parodied in _The Mighty Boosh_ - Vince describes Howard as "generic-looking" and when he paints his portrait, paints his face as a big pink circle, like a balloon. Howard's uninterested Love Interest Mrs Gideon agrees that it looks just like him, and later on Dixon Bainbridge draws a sketch of Howard the same way.
-   _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ had The Face Stealer in one episode, who could steal faces even through the Rangers' helmets, leaving them mindless zombies.

-   _Sapphire and Steel_ encountered one of these in Assignment 4 (named Mr. Shape in the credits); aside from being faceless, most of the time he could use two actual faces (both of them pretty nondescript).
-   _Spitting Image_ featured a number of literally faceless bureaucrats.
-   When we finally see Anubis' face on _Stargate SG-1_, it's just a dark swirly energy-thing.
-   In the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Charlie X", Charlie turns a laughing crewwoman into a faceless freak.

-   _Star Trek: Picard_: In "The Impossible Box", Soji's father appears in her memories this way, which is a clue that they were faked.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1985)_: In "A Matter of Minutes", every minute is built by faceless blue construction workers who are seemingly incapable of speech.
-   _Ultra Series_:
    -   Zetton from _Ultraman_ has a glowing orange patch that shoots fireballs in place of a face.
    -   Satanbizor and Bizorm from _Ultraman Gaia_, as a homage to Zetton.
    -   Greeza from _Ultraman X_ has a featureless orange dome for a head with glowing, pulsating lights within.
-   _Wednesday_ has faceless students as background characters at the academy for supernatural creatures Wednesday Addams is forced to attend.

    Music 

-   The cover of the Boards of Canada album _Music Has the Right to Children_ shows a faceless family.
-   Stephen Jones' album cover _Beautiful_ features Stephen Jones himself with women with no faces.
-   One of The Monkees' albums, _Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd._, uses this trope in its cover art.
-   The interior art of Pink Floyd's _Wish You Were Here (1975)_ depicted a faceless man in the desert dressed in business attire and hawking Pink Floyd records. He probably falls somewhere between The Blank and Invisibility because while he definitely seems to have a head, his limbs are clearly invisible, which ties in with the album's theme of absence.

-   "The Actress" by Joe Iconis is about a struggling actress who literally belts her face off during an audition. This actually works in her favor, as her lack of unique features means people only care about her impressive voice. Unfortunately, it also means nobody cares about anything else about her, and they don't notice when she dies because all she already does is scream. It appears to be a metaphor about how the industry shuns uniqueness.

    Music Videos 

-   Probably one of the _least_ strange things to appear in the Deranged Animation that is the music video for "I Miss You" by Björk.
-   The surreal music video for the Manic Street Preachers' "If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next" features a faceless family — they have noses although no nostrils but their eyes and mouths are simply papered over with blank flesh. Combined with the song itself, it's very disturbing.

    Myths & Religion 

-   The _noppera-bō_ of Japanese myth like to do this as a way to scare people: They're shapeshifters, and once they've finished playing with their latest victim, they wipe away their current face before vanishing.
    -   From the same mythos, _mujina_ sometimes scare people by posing as noppera-bō (when mujina are their own sort of creature rather than another name for tanuki, anyways.) Westerners primarily know of both from Lafcadio Hearn's short story "Mujina", which has led to noppera-bō being identified as mujina in works such as _Dungeons & Dragons_.
-   It's unclear whether or not a mythological character with no facial features actually exists in Chinese Mythology, but one parable told by Daoist philosopher Chuang Zu tells the story of The Blank "Hun Dun": the other gods took pity on him and tried to give him regular facial features like everyone else, but the process ends up killing him.
-   The Grey Man of Pawleys Island, South Carolina has a reputation as a benevolent version of The Blank. A faceless man in a dapper grey suit and hat, he strolls down the beach whenever a hurricane is due to hit the island, allowing just enough time for residents to escape to the mainland. While no one knows exactly who he is the ghost _of_, the Grey Man is credited with saving thousands of lives over the past century and a half.
-   The udug/uttuku demons of Mesopotamian Mythology were nameless and formless beings most frequently described as a dark shadow or an absence of light.

    Podcasts 

-   The Silent One, a recurring enemy in _Dark Dice_ is described as having no facial features except for three empty eye sockets.
-   One of the recurring characters in _Welcome to Night Vale_ is the faceless old woman who secretly lives in your home. Despite her lack of facial features she can see and speak, and would like to know your wifi password.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Deadlands: Hell on Earth_, the abominations known as the Nowhere Men appear as man-shaped humanoids; their build and rough features matching men's exactly, but they are devoid of facial features. Their eyes and mouths are sealed up and their noses and ears merge seamlessly into their skulls.

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: The _Basic D&D_ Known World and _AD&D Mystara_ settings feature a monster called the _mujina_, which is based off of a misidentification of the Japanese _noppera-bō_. Angels are also faceless in 4th edition. According to the Word of God, this is a change made specifically to evoke this trope.
-   _Legend of the Five Rings_: The Lying Darkness can give incredible stealth and mimicry skills to ninja — the only cost is a literal and figurative loss of identity. Their faces become smooth as eggshells when they're not imitating someone — when they revert to their shadowy selves, they can cause their features to melt off, revealing this blank slate and seriously freaking out whoever sees the effect.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
    -   This overlaps with White Mask of Doom in the Phyrexian Machine Orthodoxy (the Porcelain Legion to be more precise) and their Grand Cenobite Elesh Norn. The "porcelain" plates they wear on their faces look like masks, but actually grow as a part of the body of native Phyrexians and are grafted organically into the bodies of new, usually involuntary converts. Elesh Norn herself is only a partial example — contrarily to the majority of her legion, the lower part of her face is still visible under her extravagant plate.
    -   The elemental spirit Muldrotha doesn't have a face, as such — her head is a featureless orb of swamp water, with no features save for a pair of horns a glowing light at its center.
-   _Pathfinder_: Whisperers, fey described in the _Bestiary 6_, have a pale light that shines where their face should be.
-   _Scarred Lands_: In _Swords and Sorcery Creature Collection_, Face Stealers in their natural form look like tall, slightly distorted lanky humanoids covered in shaggy hair, with unnaturally long arms and a horned ferret-like head that seems too small for its body. However, a face stealer is seldom encountered in its natural form as it can magically peel away the faces of their victims, leaving the unfortunate souls with no facial features, just raw flesh covering their heads and two nostril holes where the nose should be.
-   _Vampire: The Masquerade_: The story of Jaggedy Andy, one particularly nasty case of Body Horror courtesy of Sascha Vykos. Long story short, Andy pissed off Vykos enough that Vykos used Vicissitude to flatten his entire face. While Andy was dying from suffocation, Vykos had one of their Sabbat goons Embrace him. Now Andy is forever doomed to unlive with a face without orifices. He can subvert this by chiseling his face to reopen his eyes and mouth, but being a Vampire means all damage will be healed when he goes to sleep. And the worst part? Andy noted that this isn't the worst Vykos can do.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Eldar Harlequins provide a straight example from the same universe. Being Monster Clowns, they wear elaborate Harlequin costumes which can cause various hallucinations or delusions to afflict enemy troops. The models often often depict them with a mask that is half The Blank and half face.
    -   Dark Eldar Mandrakes sometimes have completely featureless faces (though some only lack eyes, and some only lack mouths).
    -   Some Chaos Champions in Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000 are without facial features as a gift from their fickle divine patrons. Usually with no loss of sensory ability. One classic Chaos Champion of Tzeentch model from the late 80s was sculpted to represent this mutation.
    -   The helmets of the Tau evoke this and Cyber Cyclops, by contrast with the usual Rage Helm style.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_: One of the Mutations that can be inflicted by Chaos exposure causes the person's facial features to crawl away, leaving them completely blank. They somehow retain their senses of sight, hearing, and smell, and lose the need to eat and drink, but are forever hungry and thirsty.

    Theatre 

-   _The Bat_: The Bat wears a featureless mask (although up close it can be seen that it has eyeholes). This causes witnesses to describe him as being without a face.

    Theme Parks 

-   At Disney's Hollywood Studios, the walkaround characters include the green army men from the _Toy Story_ films...who have green mesh over their face, probably not scaring any children at all.

    Toys 

    Video Games 

-   _Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere_ does something like this with COFFIN\-equipped planes that have no outwardly visible cockpit; it's not as disturbing as a faceless human being would be, but it's still jarring the first time you really notice it.
-   Blanca, the cat with no face from _Animal Crossing_. Because this is a game where An Interior Designer Is You, you get to _give her_ a face! Using a magic marker!
    -   In _Animal Crossing: New Leaf_, Blanca takes a different role, more akin to the mythical Noppera-Bo (See mythology for more). Instead of letting the player draw on her face, she becomes the April Fools event character, shapeshifting into villagers and letting the player decide who is the real villager and who is Blanca.
-   _Bendy and the Ink Machine_'s Sammy Lawrence never had his face shown during the first four chapters. In _Chapter 5_, when Henry finally sees his face, there isn't one - just a head made of ink. This was later debunked in the credits of _Chapter 5_ but it's presumably his face is covered in ink.
-   _The Binding of Isaac_: Angels are generally depicted this way, with the exception of the Angel Baby enemies and some angel familiar items. Statues in angel rooms lack faces, as do Uriel and Gabriel. _Afterbirth_ adds a Seraphim transformation that turns Isaac himself in to an angel, which also gives him a blank face.
-   Hakumen from the _BlazBlue_ series always has his face covered by a featureless white mask. His name means white face or blank face.
-   Noroko from _The Black Heart_ normally has no face. Until she begins screaming.
-   In _BoxxyQuest: The Gathering Storm_, Anonymous is completely lacking facial features. It’s an especially notable example since he’s one of the lead main characters, who isn’t meant to be scary at all. Interestingly, his blankness only gets brought up in conversation once, in an optional scene at that, when Til struggles to guess whether or not he’s “smiling.”
-   The Elementalists in _Braveland Wizard_ are the only unit with no facial features whatsoever.
-   In the Flash game _But That Was Yesterday_, all of the characters have no facial features except for a nose.
-   The Tall Man from the _Chzo Mythos_ and Trilby at the beginning of the first game and in _The Art of Theft_.
-   The undead German soldiers you fight in the Otherworld level of _The Darkness_.
-   Aside from the giants, none of the stick figures in _Defend Your Castle_ have faces.
-   In _Devil Survivor 2_, generic JP's members are drawn without a face for a literal version of Faceless Goons. However, they have a face in universe.
-   At the end of _D'LIRIUM_, the protagonist, Ada encounters her friends, apparently alive despite their deaths inaugurating the start of the game, but completely faceless and in a state of torment. Whether the player decides to kill them or not triggers the Multiple Endings.
-   In _Doki Doki Literature Club!_, A Glitch in the Matrix makes Natsuki's face disappear at a moment when she's being mind-controlled.
-   _EverQuest_ has a faceless god in Cazic-Thule, the god of fear. It's worth noting that the rest of his body is _heavily_ muscled and brutal-looking, and he has _four_ arms. And no face. So how _do_ you tell whom he's most likely to put those arms to use on?
-   True Assassin from _Fate/stay night_ turns out to have had no face after Dark Sakura kills him and removes his mask.
-   Nobody in the game _Feel the Magic: XY/XX_ or its sequel have any kind of distinguishing facial characteristics, aside from one instance, each, of a beard and a mustache.
-   Faceless Squall from _Final Fantasy VIII_. It's so creepy, it's even the game's Nightmare Fuel page image!
    -   The Final Boss has no face either.
-   The _Ghostrunner_ has no face, only a visored head. This helps the player project themselves onto him.
-   None of the characters in _The Granstream Saga_ have any faces (observe), a stylistic choice which some people found disturbing. The only exception is that characters with moustaches still have them drawn on in the right place.
-   The Flash game _Gretel and Hansel 2_ introduces creepy squiggly _things_ that steal faces from other people. Their victims are turned into Blanks and lose all motivation and drive along with their faces - they can't even _move_. This even applies to their _ghosts_.
-   Several _Grow_ games have humanoid creatures named Onkies (singular is "onky") who have no face but they still manage to look cute with their interactions and how they seems to be made of wax or modeling clay.
-   In _Heart of the Woods_, Madison spots Tara outside in a snowstorm, and only realizes "Tara" is an illusion when she sees that "Tara" doesn't have a face.
-   Apparently, Xion from _Kingdom Hearts_ was faceless at one point or another, or rather she has a face, but what people see in her depends on who they have connections to or what they expect to see in her. The implication is that anyone who has no connection to either Sora or Ven will see Xion this way.
-   In _Krunker_, due to (intentional) graphical limitations and stylistic choice, all of the boxy characters have no faces.
-   Dark Link from the _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_. In most games he doesn't even have eyes.
-   The homunculi in the last few levels of _Mage Gauntlet_ have no faces, and many appear to be decaying or covered in tumors. They appear again in _Wayward Souls_ as the Faceless. Justified - they're Whitebeard's failed alchemical clones.
-   The Cyborgs (the enemies with treads for legs, not the Mjolnir Mark IVs) in the _Marathon_ series.
-   While he's not entirely faceless, Decoy Octopus from _Metal Gear Solid_ cut off his nose and ears in order to make his disguises more convincing.
-   The shareware _Mike's Cards_ does this with the default court cards<small>◊</small> as of version 1.8 (August 2001).
-   Guardians from _Nuclear Throne_ have vaguely humanoid or animal shapes, but all of them have a tiny active portal where their face would be.
-   The many Toads held captive in the Temple of Shrooms in _Paper Mario: The Origami King_ have no faces, walk around like zombies, and are functionally lobotomized. They actually do have faces; it's just that Hole Punch, the boss of the temple, punched them out and stored them away. Destroy Hole Punch and the Toads get their faces back.
-   Ideal Maki/Mary of _Persona_ becomes this way in the Lost Forest when she figures out she is not the real Maki.
    -   In _Persona 2: Innocent Sin_, Shadow Maya still has a face in her character portrait, but her character sprite has no eyes (the only facial feature visible on the sprites) to make her effectively faceless when she shows up. It's the first of several (obvious) signs that something is very wrong with her, though it's surprisingly easy to miss at first but for a subtle feeling of wrongness about her appearance.
-   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice_, Inga suffers from prosopagnosia, so he remembers everyone this way. When a Divination Seance is held after Inga is murdered, showing what he saw in his final moments, his killer has no face, and his true killer exploits this to try to frame someone for the crime.
-   In _Pokémon Sun and Moon_, UB-01, UB-03 and UB Burst aka Nihilego, Xurkitree and Blacephalon respectively have nothing resembling a face, likely to highlight their alien nature. Blacephalon still remains ambiguous with the yellow dots on the floral objects decorating the sides of its head appear to be eyes (since it can blink).
    -   Staryu and Starmie are more ambiguous due their cores.
    -   Zygarde is similarly ambiguous; it has geometric patterns on its face that _could_ be interpreted as eyes, but it's hard to tell.
    -   Roggenrola just has a hole where it's face should logically be. It's evolutions have similar holes in places where eyes would normally be implying Roggenrola's face might actually be a single giant eye.
        -   The truth is worse. The Pokedex explains that hole is an EAR.
-   Tipp in _Ring Fit Adventure_ is rendered in a superflat style that simply doesn't show his face.
-   A boxing game based on the _Rocky_ movies for the Colecovision features fighters without any facial details.
-   Johnson from _Schwarzerblitz_: his face keeps on oscillating between all possible features, resulting in a blurred image (portrayed in-game as a featureless black face with white eyes).
-   The bubble-head nurses from _Silent Hill_. A lot of the more humanoid monsters in the series tend to lack faces too, or have Eyeless Faces. Although, you're lucky if that's the only thing wrong with them.
    -   Even Pyramid Head is this. In fact, Pyramid Head was designed visually to be this taken to the extreme: not only is he missing a face but his head isn't even _vaguely_ shaped like a human head; this was to make him come off as completely emotionless; his aura of sheer purpose and oppression marred only by faint traces of physical pain.
-   _Sunless Sea_: The Delightful Adventuress has a sidekick called Barnabas, who is an Unfinished Clay Man created with no face. He normally wears a mask to cover this up and the Player Character only learns he's Unfinished after you're done transporting them. After the Adventuress backstabs both of you and bury you alive in the Tomb of the First Emperor, the narration mentions that Barnabas, despite having no face, is _very_ expressive about how he feels about the betrayal.
-   Generic nameless soldiers in _Super Robot Wars_ tend to be this, both good and bad. It's not too noticeable if they're wearing space suits, but some of them look rather creepy.
-   In _Talesof Symphonia_, There is a Rare faceless enemy called the Gentleman, wearing a suit and tie. Wait a second...
-   The Shalebridge Cradle in _Thief: Deadly Shadows_ has the staff of the orphanage-turned-asylum, shadowy silhouettes created from the memory of the Cradle, representing the faceless adults keeping order between the children. They're really really scary.
-   The title character in _Tiny Thief_ has a nose but no other visible facial features.
-   The "Nopperabu" effect in _Yume Nikki_, which is a reference to the _noppera-bo_, spirits from Japanese folklore that appear to be ordinary humans, but have no faces.
-   Ethan, Synaptic and C6 robot from _Call Of Duty Infinite Warfare_ have this, since they're robots and have no facial features.
-   _Transistor_: The Breach() Function's source, unlike all other Functions' sources, doesn't have a Subject picture, instead being a faceless humanoid silhouette with a blue light coming from its chest, due to data corruption.
-   _Warframe_:

    Visual Novels 

-   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice_:
    -   The Holy Mother, the founder of the Khura'inese belief system and first ruler of the Kingdom of Khura'in, is traditionally depicted with a blank face on murals or artifacts, with a depiction of her face being considered to be blasphemy. The only artifact that shows her face is a small statue of her inside the Founder's orb, which is normally filled with opaque wax to hide said statue.
    -   Late in the game, Inga Karkhuul Khura'in, the prince consort of Queen Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in, is revealed to suffer from prosopagnosia, which makes him see everyone as being this.

    Web Animation 

-   None of the humans in _An Adventure of Sheep and Chicken_ have faces.
-   _ASDF Movie 4_: "Well, I stole your face!"
-   Pumkin of _Baman Piderman_. And, technically, Squib and the Tubas.
-   All humans in the _Madness Combat_ universe lack a face. People only begin getting individualized features when they become important story-wise, but in most cases they will still lack a mouth and eyes. Sanford, Jebediah, and the Auditor take special note for having a mouth, facial hair, and eyes respectively.
-   The premise of _Blank: A Vinylmation Love Story_ involves a pair of unpainted Vinylmation figures. In fact, a fair amount of the cast is faceless.
-   The claymotion serie _Klay World_ features clay figures without any face.

    Webcomics 

-   The Figure from _The Artist is Dead!!_ is a living, unfinished figure sketch. In an ugly raincoat.
-   Ghoul runs into one of these in _Autumn Bay_.
-   A few characters in _Cat Legend_, notably Mindy, have had their faces erased after they told a secret they were to have never known.
-   In _Champions of Far'aus_, the goddess Sarlise wears a mask because she doesn't want to disturb people with the fact she doesn't have a face.
-   This is what happens to people whose faces are stolen in _City of Blank_. What's worse, their faces can never be given back, and the victims usually die from suffocation.
-   _Coga Nito_: The lifeless robot shell Eric builds, as well as the black duplicate BB later inhabits both sport blank glass domes for faces.
-   Ma'am, Madam, Lady, etc., and Qstickman from _Educomix_.
-   Jerry from _Ennui GO!_ is a homeless man whom Izzy meets early in the comic. He initially has no facial features, so Izzy (and on one occasion, Renee) try to draw some onto him, but they don't stick.
-   _Erma_: Aunt Mayumi is a noppera-bō from a family of Youkai and therefore has no facial features other than a slight protrusion where her nose would be. She's somehow able to eat with the area where her mouth would be, though it's not shown how. She's never shown speaking, though it's unclear whether she can.
-   In Chapter 18 of _Gunnerkrigg Court_, Robot S1 fights a large, bull-like robot whose head is just a square slab of metal. Zimmy and Antimony run into "Nobodies" in Chapter 19, who have nothing but black smudges where their faces should be. Apparently, this is also how _real_ people sometimes look to Zimmy.
    -   Chapter 25 introduces a subversion in Kingbot. He's introduced with a face that's a featureless slab (aside from two small eyes), but he found a way to give himself facial features.
-   Mr. Three from _Hero Oh Hero_, who is a Humanoid Abomination and speaks entirely in unintelligible TV static. He seems friendly though.
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   Three of the guardians (John's dad, Rose's mom, and Dave's bro) all only have one notable facial feature (Dad's nose, Mom's mouth, Bro's glasses). Bec, Jade's guardian (and pet dog) lacks any features whatsoever. The facelessness is either an art style or a representation of how the four kids see their guardians.
    -   Doc Scratch has no facial features whatsoever, what with his head being a gigantic cueball.
    -   In Act 6, the facelessness of the Guardians continues with Alpha!Dave, Alpha!Rose, and God Cat.
-   The faceless villain from _The Incredible and Awe-Inspiring Serial Adventures of the Amazing Plasma-Man_ is named, appropriately enough, Blank. Though he does wear goggles.
-   The true forms of angels in _Kill Six Billion Demons_ can evolve with their personality. In "Wielder of Names", White Chain is criticised for having developed a very human (and female) looking form, naturally including a face. When she's finally had enough and decides to side with some extremist angels, she tears off her own face, leaving only a hole all the way through the back of her head.
-   _Lovely Lovecraft_: Night Gaunts lack faces in their true Dreamlands forms, but they gain faces in their Earthly forms. Their Dreamlands appearance is consistent with the real H. P. Lovecraft's tales, although he makes no mention of them appearing differently in the waking world.
-   All of the characters from _Nebula_ are faceless, since they are personifications of The Solar System, and are represented with the planets/celestial bodies for heads
-   In _Mias World_, we are introduced to King, who has no face. Not to mention not having any sort of distinctive details save for the small, fake crown hovering above his head.
-   In the _Oglaf_ strip "Fairest" (NSFW), the subject of the storyteller's tale is a woman with a cube-shaped head and no face.
-   In _Parallel Dementia_ while Visage has a White Mask of Doom and actually does have a face underneath, albeit an undead one, his undead minions are all faceless horrors.
-   Three from _A Path to Greater Good_ has just a white, plain expanse for a face under that mop of black hair.
-   T.O.E. in _Rice Boy_ and _Order of Tales_ is a machine man with a small circular screen for a head.
-   A very major antagonist in _Sam & Fuzzy_ is even CALLED 'Mr. Blank.' That's his name. He drinks tea through his mask. He belongs to a sect within the ninja mafia called the 'blankfaces'; elite operatives trained from childhood, who all use masks like this (different colours are apparently used to tell them apart; the only other blankface shown is called Mr. Black and wears the exact same outfit, only, you know, _black_.)
    -   Mr. Blank's face is eventually revealed retroactively when it is revealed he had infiltrated the supporting cast before the start of the current arc in a clever disguise — namely, by taking his mask _off_. Mr. Black's face is revealed in a Flashback.
    -   There's also a somewhat different sect that uses the stitching on their masks to make letters. There's a plot focusing around Mr. X and Mr. Y, though Mr. X seems to prefer leaving his mouth exposed.
-   In _YU+ME: dream_ , Faceless Man is an example of this trope, though he does eventually grow a mouth of sharp teeth.

Child Facelings, on the other hand, are mischievous and hostile. Some will try to murder survivors, others are simply pranksters.

-   There's _Justice League Unlimited_'s Question. As in the comics, his seemingly blank, featureless face is just a mask, which he affixes to (or releases from) his face with the help of an aerosol sprayed on his face. The spray also changes his hair's color, from its true red shade to the brunette tint he's normally seen in as the Question.

The script described him as a caricature of Harrison Ford, but DiC Entertainment was afraid of legal repercussions from Ford and George Lucas.

-   _Transformers_:
    -   Shockwave's face is made up of one big, menacing eye, without even so much as a faceplate. The appearance is fitting, as he's the most "robot-like" of all the characters, having few, if no, emotions similar to humans.
    -   More recently, the _Transformers: Prime_ version of Soundwave. His faceplate occasionally shows data he's browsing but never betrays himself. Add on the fact he's The Voiceless, speaking only _once_ in the entire series before attempting suicide and it's quite disturbing.

    _"You're on a scenic route through a state recreation area known as the human mind. You ask a passerby for directions only to find he has no face or something. Suddenly, up ahead, a door in the road. You swerve, narrowly avoiding..._ The Scary Door_."_
