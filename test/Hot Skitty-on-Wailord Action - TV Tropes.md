Love conquers all, including plausibility.

_"If he's a planet, how could he make a baby with your mother? He would smush her."_

The usual intermediary step between an Interspecies Romance and a Mix-and-Match Critter.

In Video Games where you Gotta Catch Them All, and where "them" are Mons, often the only way to acquire every last critter in the game is to, well, breed them. This may involve somewhat conventional animal husbandry, or stranger things, but the important thing is that there are not always reasonable limits on what can be bred to what. The unintentional (or intentional) ability to produce this phenomenon is attributed to Gameplay and Story Segregation.

In a broader sense, this may apply to any work of fiction in which two grossly dissimilar species are somehow capable of interbreeding. This pretty much misses the point of the term "species", which is supposed to indicate _which_ animals can breed successfully in the first place.<sup>Note&nbsp;</sup> 

If the result of this unholy union isn't a Half-Human Hybrid or some variety of Mix-and-Match Critter, then Gender Equals Breed may very well apply, with the offspring being strictly one of its parent species. It’s also possible that the child is a completely different species from either of their parents.

In case you did not understand all that: To make a long story short, it's basically a giant animal in a romantic relationship with a small animal. So, how can they make babies?

This is somewhat Truth in Television, because as strange as this may seem, there ARE species in the real world which display this same sort of extreme dimorphism, to the point where they have been miscategorized as wholly different species in the past. Anglerfish males, due to being basically just parasitic appendages to females, are arguably the most famous example. This just might be one of these cases. However, most of the time, Pregnancy Does Not Work That Way in Real Life.

The trope name itself comes from the GameFAQs boards, where the user "Endgame" made a topic containing the name and elaborated (see the Video Games entry on this page for explanation).

Compare Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex. See Also Interspecies Romance, Boldly Coming, and Hybrid Monster. See Bestiality Is Depraved for when it’s a human and an animal. See G-Rated Sex for when this is seen as Unfortunate Implications and therefore defied with a means of reproduction that avoids mating like normal animals. If they're the same or very similar species, it can be Huge Guy, Tiny Girl or Tiny Guy, Huge Girl.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _½ Prince_ has the cast trying to figure out how Gui's pet phoenix would be able to mate with Prince's pet _meatbun_.
-   Subverted in the ending of the _Akame ga Kill!_ manga. Tatsumi is turned into a giant dragon, but he and Mine still get married and retire to raise a family in the countryside. However, Mine got pregnant _before_ Tatsumi became a dragon.
-   _Basquash!_ teases a coupling between Sela and Naviga. The problem is that Sela is a moderately-sized (albeit thin) human woman and Navi is a friendly, twenty-foot tall giant. Considering Sela goes on and on about getting the "genes" from the best Basquasher around, and Navi is pretty damn good, well... try not to think about it too hard.
-   _Beastars_: Partially a Deconstruction. Different species can have sex each other, but the less related the two species are, the lower the chance of having offspring. So it is possible, but very unlikely, for a reptile to have a child with a mammal. And if two very different species have a child, the results are often not pretty.
    -   Legosi is a grey wolf who is in love with Haru, a rabbit, who is also half of his size. Before their relationship started, Haru had sexual relations with several other males of different species of herbivores, including Louis the deer. They have so far remained chaste due to the danger that Legosi might unintentionally eat her during sex. When the topic of compatibility comes up, Haru asks Legosi to show her his genitals so she can check if they will have problems when they finally do have sex.
    -   Bill, a tiger, has had sexual relations with a female Zebra, mostly because they are both striped species.
    -   Legosi's maternal grandfather is a Komodo dragon who accidentally got a grey wolf pregnant. Their child, who was Legosi's mother, was born looking like a grey wolf, but when she reached adulthood she started changing into a reptile, which caused her to be Driven to Suicide. It is possible that Legosi may go through the same thing, but currently he looks mostly like a grey wolf other than having slightly reptilian eyes, high pain tolerance, and immunity to Komodo dragon venom.
    -   Melon is half leopard and half gazelle. He inherited a combination of instincts from both parents, which has given him several serious psychological issues, and got neither parents' sense of taste and so can't enjoy eating any kind of food. Legosi worries that if he ever does have kids with Haru they may have the same problems as Melon.
-   _Berserk_ in one of the most horrific and gut wrenching displays of Mars Needs Women goes full into this showing that the various demonic Humanoid Abomination Apostles (some of whom are 20 feet tall or resemble shoggoths) totally go after and rape human women who of course usually die in the process. Wyald one such Apostle tried to have his way with Casca in his One-Winged Angel colossal ape demon form and was thankfully brutally stopped by Guts whom sliced his tongue phallus off. Poor Casca wasn’t so fortunate in the Eclipse however where she’s violated by several Apostles many times her size before being sexually assaulted again by Femto in his inhuman Physical God form. Thanks to being Made of Iron Casca survives but understandably her mental state shatters and she mentally regresses to a child for years.
-   _Dragon Ball_ has multiple couplings of size and species disparity such as the giant Ox-King and his normal-sized late wife or the even more extreme Tarble the Saiyan and his tiny alien wife Gure whom is not particularly humanoid. More recently there’s Broly another Saiyan and Cheelai a Green-Skinned Space Babe whose size difference is a little _worrying_ though granted his base form isn’t too much bigger than her, unlike his giant Super Mode. Speaking of Cheelai, Beerus a Humanoid Cat alien shows sexual attraction to her in _Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero_ and considering male feline spine penises it’s probably best not to imagine how that would work.
-   _Dragon Half_:
    -   This manga features, unsurprisingly, the offspring of a human and a dragon. She basically looks like an adorable teenage human girl with horns and a tail, she's super strong, and her name is Mink for some reason.
    -   Princess Vina too. When you're tired of looking at her humany cuteness, drop a heavy weight on her and go "Aw!" over her slime-moldy cuteness.
    -   Both of those involved shapeshifting from a non-human into a human form. Vina was born as a slimemold, she had to learn magic to change into something humanoid.
-   Shows up in _Interspecies Reviewers_. While visiting the fairy brothel, the males have to be measured to see which of the girls (if any) they're compatible with.
    -   Taken up to eleven with the introduction of marriage. The miracle of marriage guarantees that a husband and wife will be compatible, regardless of species. Demonstrated with an eight-foot-tall ogre and his six-inch-tall fairy wife.
-   _Inuyasha_:
    -   Inuyasha's demon father and human mother. The Inu no Taishou does have a human form, but his true form is the size of a mountain. Notably, Inuyasha himself is a Little Bit Beastly, but otherwise completely humanoid, while his fully demon half-brother Sesshomaru is also normal-sized but with a much larger (although not anywhere as large as his father's) true form.
    -   Actually, this is not just for the parents of Inuyasha, but for the parents of all hanyou. Because only powerful youkai can look like humans, and look completely different in their true form, and are often even much larger.
    -   Miroku attempts to rescue a princess in the manga and finds that she is beautiful but tiny, like Issun Boshi (Inch-High Boy). He scrutinizes her for a moment before muttering that "it could work". Sango is disturbed but likely not surprised.
-   In _Nyaruko: Crawling with Love!_, this one of many reasons for Mahiro's resistance to Nyarko's advances; she's an alien whose race helped inspire the Cthulhu Mythos, and while she may _look_ like a cute girl, that's just the most pleasant of her 1,000 forms, the other 999 of which would probably make his mind snap like a dry twig. Nyarko, for her part, seems convinced that they can reproduce and wants to have "enough kids to start our own soccer team" (her own words).
-   _One Piece_:
    -   There are people called "Wotans", a hybrid race of Fishman and Giants. While Fishman are generally taller than humans, Giants are dozens of feet tall, which brings up an interesting question of how that works.
    -   The Fishman Island arc has the union of the merman King Neptune and the mermaid Queen Otohime, who are roughly giant-sized and human-sized, respectively. Otohime then somehow gave birth to Princess Shirahoshi, who even as a baby looked about 10 times as big as her mother. Even if we concede that mermaids lay eggs like fish do, there's no way she could have laid something as large as Shirahoshi, not to mention that a pregnant mermaid is depicted in the background of one episode. (Unless Shirahoshi simply had a hell of a growth spurt during the months following her birth, but that's a big stretch.)
    -   Fishman and mermen in general have this trope to an extent, as they never seem to mind what species of fish they're based off of. And their genetics keep past generations in memory for much longer than humans; a pufferfish fishman and a wolffish merman have been shown to be brothers.
    -   Big Mom and pretty much every one of her husbands was this due to her being 880cm (28'10½"), but in particular is the coupling that produced Normande, her half-human/half-dwarf daughter, meaning one of her partners was a Dwarf. Considering the size of Big Mom and the fact _One Piece_ Dwarves are small enough to easily stand in a normal-sized human's hand, it's probably best not to think to much on how that worked.
-   Kasai and Uwabami in _Oumagadoki Doubutsuen_. He's an armor-wearing rhino man in his transformed state, and she's a young woman whose hair ends in three snakes.
-   Subverted, oddly enough, in _Pokémon: The Series_. While romances do sometimes occur between different Pokémon, they are almost always either similar in appearance (Meowth, for instance, has had crushes on a couple of other cat-like Pokémon) or at least the same type. There have, however, been a couple of Pokemon that seemed to have something approaching romantic feelings for their human trainers, including Ash's Chikorita. Also, the move Attract works on any Pokémon of the opposite gender. This trope is played with a little when Jessie's Wobbuffet, despite the fact that it looks like a blue punching bag with stubby legs, fell head-over-heels in love with a wild Kirlia (a human-like Pokémon) so much that it disobeyed Jessie to protect her. It wasn't clear what the Kirlia thought about this.
-   _Ranking of Kings_: Daida's father is a giant big enough to hold a full grown person in his hand, his mother is a human woman of average height. Questions about the logistics of his conception easily come to mind. The best implied explanation so far is that his mother has Healing Hands, making her more likely than the average person to know something that can help things along.
-   _RuriDragon_: Ruri's mother is a human and her father is a dragon the size of a house. When she asks her mother how she was conceived, she tells Ruri to ask her father. When she asks her father, he starts trembling and tells her to ask her mother.
-   _The Seven Deadly Sins_: At the end of the story, it's revealed that King, a fairy about the size of a human, and Diane, a giantess, had a child together. Though Merlin did give Diane magical pills that shrink her to human size and Diane later mentions she ran out of the pills because there were a lot of "occasions" where she needed them.

    Comedy 

-   In Bill Cosby's old "Seattle" routine, he describes the Seattle Zoo's attempt to induce their old male gorilla to mate. As a last resort, they shoot him with an aphrodisiac-filled dart, which the ape pulls out and throws away when it does nothing for him. Unfortunately, it strikes a hippo.
    
    **Bill:** And the hippo went wild! I mean, everything... birds, trees, grass, garbage cans. He was all over the place. As a matter of fact, they have some of the weirdest looking animals out in that zoo now... they have a giraffe with a hippo's head and his neck can't hold the head up!
    
-   Kevin Smith often tells a story about his dog Mulder, a huge chocolate lab, whom Smith had assumed was asexual due to a total disinterest in humping anything. Then he brought home Shecky, a miniature dachshund too small to get fixed. Mulder was all over Shecky the first time she went into heat.

    Comic Books 

-   They were brainwashed, of course, but during the _Atlantis Attacks_ storyline, the Deviant Ghaur used the Mark of Set to place seven heroines — She-Hulk, Storm, Dagger, the Scarlet Witch, Marvel Girl, the Invisible Woman, and Andromeda — under his control into a group called the Brides of Set, under the pretense that they would mate with Set and produce offspring. This never actually happened, but seeing as Set is a titanic snake-god with seven heads, the gods only know _how_ it would have been done. Magic, probably. (After Set was defeated, his backup plan, trying to use the Brides as sacrifices to resurrect Set, was a little more believable, but it still failed.)
-   In the French comic _Black Moon Chronicles_, there's Ghorghor Bey, who is a several meters tall half-human, half-ogre. One could only wonder how his parents had sex, until Ghorghor got his own spinoff where it was revealed that his mother was raped by a young ogre during a pillage. Late in the story, Wismerhill gifts Ghorghor a ring that allows him to shrink at will. The only point of this gift was allowing him to have normal sex.
-   Cerebus the Aardvark got it on with a human woman and had a mostly-human child. Apparently all the dominant aardvark traits manifest in the toes.
-   D.P. 7 has David Landers, whose superpower is basically super-gigantism, start a relationship with Stephanie Harrington, a normal sized woman.
-   _Firebreather_ stars the offspring of a pairing between a human woman and a giant dragon, which resulted in a scaled, orange-skinned, four-fingered, but essentially human-looking offspring. She tried to explain how this happened, but we don't know because her son covered his ears. Apparently it was quite simple.
-   In Gambit's 2013 series, he is pulled into Camelot and is approached by several beautiful pixie women no bigger than his hand. When he returns, it's hinted that he had sex with them. _How_, exactly, we're never told. However, it's possible that size-shifting is involved, as Pete Wisdom used to _date_ the sister of one of them, implied to be his ex Tinkabelinos a.k.a. 'Tink' (imagine Boadicea as a punk rocker and you've got the idea).
-   _Gold Digger_ has a race of women who evolved into giants to fight the monsters on their island while the males stay at normal size. It was noted that the "equipment" of men and women on the island had evolved in a way that allowed mating.
-   This has been a common observation of The Incredible Hulk and his multiple much smaller-sized lovers and wives. Though granted Betty, Jarella, Umar and Caiera all have Super-Toughness and are otherwise supernatural/alien to justify not getting crushed in sex (Betty even having sex with him in her Red Harpy form). Marlo Chandler is the exception being unmistakably human when she was Mr. Fixit’s girlfriend yet clearly survived any night of passion they likely had. She-Hulk likewise has several human male love interests who are much smaller than her and have not been Snu Snu-ed to death likely due to her self-control. Granted the only partner Shulkie had when she was well and truly hulk-sized was Thor, who could absolutely survive it.
-   In _Invincible_ it's an actual plot point that Viltrumites can breed with pretty much every species with Nolan mating with a female bug alien to produce Oliver and Oliver himself marrying and impregnating this lovely creature.
-   In a _Johnny the Homicidal Maniac_ sidestory comic, some really, _really_ stupid aliens visit Earth and force a man to Mate or Die with a chicken in order to study human reproduction (they thought the chicken was a human female... Did we mention they were really stupid?). The result are freakish half-human half-chicken hybrids, with the details of their conception and gestation being blessedly skipped over by the story.
-   Larry Niven's article "Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex" details just why Superman can/should not reproduce with human ladies. Of course, given how often his powers change, this probably won't be what stops Superman and Lois from having children.
-   The minor Marvel Comics character Epsilon Red is only able to survive in a vacuum. Shaky science, but fair enough so far. In a flashback (set well after he was turned from an ordinary human into a spaceman), his wife is shown to be pregnant. Think about that for a moment.
-   Briefly mentioned in _Runaways_, when two characters discuss the possibility of a normal-sized woman getting impregnated by Galactus. He's not the father, Ultron is - which makes even less sense at first glance.
-   _Saga_:
    -   One of the reasons why Marko and Alana weren't careful in their relationship was because they weren't sure if their species could interbreed (even though the Landfall and the Wreath are both very human-like in form), resulting in Alana getting pregnant and kicking off the whole plot.
    -   When Alana needs to get an abortion after her second pregnancy is lost, Prince Robot IV tries to pass her off as his wife, as her relationship with an enemy Wreath would draw attention. The sheriff they meet expresses surprise at the claim that the people of Landfall and the Robot Kingdom can interbreed.
    -   On the same planet, the heroes also meet an outlaw family, consisting of a human man, a centaur woman, and their son, who resembles a centaur with a skeletal horse head jutting out his abdomen.
-   The pre-reboot _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_, based on the _Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)_ continuity, has Sonic the Hedgehog's girlfriend as the half-squirrel, half-chipmunk Sally Acorn. There have been a fair number of "future" substories where the two of them are married and have kids. This is later subverted when it's revealed that the "Mobian" species is simply one single Funny Animal species that happens to have interbreedable sub-species/races that are much more apparent than humans' different skin colors. For the standard of Sonic and Sally's generation, almost every possible pairing outside of Knuckles and Julie-Su are of the different animals (hyena/rabbit, skunk/cat, hedgehog/fox, hedgehog/mongoose, fox/mongoose) yet they are not very different in terms of physical appearances and social functions. For example, King Rob O' The Hedge (the cousin of Amy Rose) was married to an Echidna woman named Mari-An and they had a child together. He was clearly a hybrid, even though he physically resembled an Echidna (i.e. his mother).
-   The example with Set becomes a little stranger when you consider Yith, a character who first appeared in _Spider-Man, Quality of Life_, who is Set's descendent. While Set's offspring and grandchildren tended to be abominations like himself (members of the family line include Echidna, Typhoon, and Cetus, according to most sources) Yith seems mostly human, resembling a human woman with a long, snake-like tail instead of legs and reptilian eyes. Exactly where her family lost most of the "monster genes" over the centuries and how it happened isn't known.
-   _Sub-Mariner_: Namor has absolutely no issue with having sex with Eldritch Abomination sea life twice his size and is only disgusted at Hope Summers’ prejudiced squick reaction to it. He’s a Flying Brick so can come out unscathed from most interspecies coupling.
-   An issue from Alan Moore's run on _Swamp Thing_ has a humungous technoorganic Living Ship using Swampy's genetic material to create half plant/half machine hybrids. There’s also the business of Abigail Arcane Swamp Thing’s human wife having sex with him, which the comic depicts in rather “abstract” and mystical fashion instead of going into the technicalities of a woman having intercourse with a Swamp Monster.
-   Smax from _Top 10_ is the child of a yeti-like ogre and the warrior-woman he captured and raped. She may have survived the pregnancy... if she didn't have twins.

    Comic Strips 

-   In one _Bloom County_ arc, Hodge Podge and Rosebud, respectively a jackrabbit and "basselope" (basset hound/antelope) had jackabasselope children.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Monsters, Inc._ fanfiction _Angela's Pet Monster_, Randall (a lizard-like monster) and Lucille (a saluki dog) have puppies together.
-   In a parody of the typical Interspecies Romance seen in _Zootopia_ fics, _Born to Be Wilde_ features the explicitly sexual relationship of a spotted hyena and...a rat. A wheelchair-bound rat. No one in-universe knows how it works either.
-   There exists a _Chronicles of Narnia_ fanfic in which there were many not-oblique-enough references made to Ettins (akin to extremely large orcs) who abducted humans (men, surprisingly) in order to produce magically-viable offspring, since generations of inbreeding and incest had destroyed the health of the Ettin line. The abducted humans, unsurprisingly, usually didn't survive much past the experience<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   Some dark corner of the internet hosts a _Dragon Age: Origins_ fic that pairs the Warden with the Archdemon (who's a 100+ foot long dragon-cum-Eldritch Abomination). Squick.
-   _Hivefled_ involved the Grand Highblood doing terrible things to Gamzee, and then helpfully provided a size comparison chart. Keep in mind Gamzee is tiny for even a pre-final-pupation purpleblood, but noticeably bigger than most young trolls. GH also regularly has consensual sex with Condesce, who isn't much bigger than Gamzee; at least they had thousands of years to practice.
-   In _How does it work_ Harry exhibits a disturbing level of interest in how Hagrid's human father and giantess mother could possibly have conceived him. Not to mention the logistics of female human/male giant encounters...
-   Averted to a degree in the _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_ fancomic, _Of Mice and Mayhem_. During the prologue, Chip acknowledges his feelings for Gadget but refuses to act on them because he believes she will one day want to have children, which wouldn't be an option for them since he's a chipmunk and she's a mouse. This is later worked around, as a previous gene splice between Dale and Gadget left Gadget the ability to mate with chipmunks.
-   _Pony POV Series_:
    -   In Dark World, Rarity and Spike are an Official Couple, with Spike now being a full-grown dragon and far larger than she is. Loose Canon taking place after the series is over has other characters lampshade it with some level of Squick involved. Spike implies Rarity's ascension to Alicorn status has something to do with it.
    -   A flashback to the time when Luna became Nightmare Moon also shows a half-Dragon/half-pony hybrid, showing the two species can actually mate and produce offspring. In the same Loose Canon as above, it's shown that Rarity actually ends up pregnant with Spike's child.
-   In _The Potioneer's Assistant Rebrewed_ Harry's best guess at the genetics of Mishon, a hybrid elfling who speaks Parseltongue, is half house elf and half dragon. Sirius points out the size discrepancy almost immediately.
-   Parodic _Redwall_ fanfic The Search pokes fun at cross-species shipping, involving a male otter and female squirrel going on an epic quest to find a workable lube, namely the extremely rare Kaywhy plant.
-   There has been at least one _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ fan fic where Odo and Nerys not only have intimate contact, but their union produces an offspring. If Changelings are anything like Amorphs, that could result in a relatively simple birth on either partner for so many reasons.
-   _Taylor Varga_: Taylor is explicitly stated to be capable of conceiving offspring with a regular human, despite the fact that as a half-demon she no longer even functions via biology as conventionally defined.
-   _One Piece_ fanfiction _This Bites!_ explains that the reason why Alabastan Kung Fu Dugongs look like turtle/armadillo-shelled seals is because they descend from a _massive_ series of Interspecies Romance between manatees and turtles. As in, the parent races _crossbred themselves into extinction_, leaving behind only their new armor-plated pinniped offspring. It's actually something that the dugongs themselves are a little embarrassed over.
-   _'Twas Beauty Kissed the Beast_ is an intentional parody of the trope; it pairs Rarity (a pony) with King Kong (a multi-story-tall gorilla).

    Films — Animation 

-   _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers (2022)_ reveals that after the original series Gadget (a mouse) and Zipper (a housefly) got married and are now the parents of 42 mouse/fly hybrids akin to the Dronkeys mentioned below.
-   The Troma distributed _Chirpy_, a horrifyingly detailed short featuring a bird having sex with a horse. It's best known for being reviewed by Diamanda Hagan, who has made videos out of audiences reacting to it.
-   The Cartoon Network original movie for _Firebreather_ has the main character Duncan, whose mother is a human and father is a massive Kaiju. It's Lampshaded in one scene when his mother tries to explain how its possible, only for him to refuse to listen.
-   _Leo the Lion_ ends with the titular protagonist and Savannah (_an elephant_) having babies, which are a pair of hideous elephant-lion hybrids.
-   Referenced in _The Lion King 1 ½_, where Timon (a meerkat) proposes to Shenzi (a hyena) to stall for time.
    
    **Timon:** Shenzi Marie Predatora Veldetta Jacquelina Hyena... would you do me the honor of becoming... my bride?  
    **Shenzi:** _\[pending several seconds of shocked horror from both sides\]_ I don't think so!  
    **Timon:** Shenzi Marie, please. I know what you're thinking: "We're too different." "It'll never work." "What will the children look like?"  
    **Shenzi:** Ooh, that violates so many laws of nature!  
    **Timon:** Listen to me! The problems of a couple of wacky kids like us don't amount to a hill of termites in this nutty circle-of-life thing. And so I ask you: If not now, when? If not me, who? I'm lonely...
    
-   _Meet the Robinsons_: Uncle Fritz’s “wife” is a Hand Puppet called Aunt Petunia, and they have children together. While it’s very possible that they’re adopted (after all, the movie is partially about adoption anyway), their children actually do resemble the both of them, so who knows?
-   _Shrek 2_: At the very end, we're shown Dragon and Donkey's offspring. According to the action figures, they're called "Dronkeys". They're pretty strange-looking, too- they’re donkey foals with dragon wings. Amusingly enough, the gag started life when the first movie came out, as a short comic in a Mad Magazine. The animators probably thought "Why the hell not?"
    
    **Donkey:** Look at all our little mutant babies!
    
-   _Trolls Band Together_: After retiring from BroZone, Spruce, now going by Bruce, married Brandy, who comes from a race of muppet-like people known as Vacaytioners, who are about fifteen times taller than Trolls. They have ten hybrid children together; when John Dory asks how that's possible, Brandy admits they doesn't even know.
-   In Ralph Bakshi's _Wizards_, Elinore is a human-size half-human/half-fairy, whose mother was the tiny latter, a size comparison can be seen here. One can only imagine what the birth must have been like…

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Discussed Trope in the 1993 remake of _Attack of the 50-Foot Woman_. Nancy, who by this point is so big that she requires an in-ground swimming pool to bathe, proposes rekindling her marriage with her (average-sized) husband. His incredulous retort asks if he will need a wetsuit and a flashlight.
-   _Big Top Pee-wee_ features a Freak Show which includes the circus owner's wife, who is small enough to be carried in his shirt pocket, which he often does. How a relationship between a couple of such a size difference would work is never addressed and left to Rule of Funny.
-   In _BrainDead_, the backstory of the zombie plague involves diseased rats raping monkeys in Sumatra, creating the undead and contagious Sumatran Rat-Monkey.
-   Interspecies prostitution in _District 9_. Apparently, the Prawns are hermaphroditic, and have organs for both options. Brain Bleach, anyone? However, they can't produce young, as can be seen by the malformed and stillborn attempts at fusing Prawn and human DNA.
-   _Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald_ confirms that humans can interbreed with house elves, a race of spindly two-foot tall magical creatures.
-   One script of _Galaxy Quest_ has this ending for Fred and Laliari. Thankfully, this was not shown. Laliari is a Thermian, a species of Starfish Aliens who look like an octopus eating a squid. She uses a hologram to "dress up" as human, but apparently _takes it off to have sex_. "Ohhhh that's not right" indeed!
-   _The Golden Child_ has Kala, a female human/dragon hybrid, one of whose ancestors was supposedly raped by a dragon.
-   Quoted above is a line from _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_, after it is revealed that Peter is the son of Ego the Living Planet, a Celestial who, as his title implies, is a living planet. Since Peter's mother, Meredith Quill, was an ordinary human, Drax wonders how Ego could have gotten her pregnant with a son, but Ego has a human-sized avatar that he can use for mating.
-   In _Hellboy II: The Golden Army_, it is discovered that Liz is pregnant with Hellboy's children. The film never explains exactly how this works, but in the comics, Hellboy is the magically-conceived offspring of a rather large demon and a human witch, which may help explain it.
-   In _Jurassic World_, one of the Verizon investors assumes that this is how the _Indominus rex_ was created. Dr. Wu has to explain otherwise.
    
    **Jim Drucker:** How did you get two different kinds of dinosaurs to...you know...? _(makes awkward hand gestures)_  
    **Dr. Wu:** Oh, _Indominus_ wasn't bred. She was _designed_.
    
-   In _Splice_, at the climax, the human/multi-animal hybrid Dren, a teenage female in physiological age, engages in sexual intercourse with her father. Needless to say, a major cause of Squick. Later Dren becomes (?) male and impregnates their mother. It's that kind of a movie.

    Jokes 

-   Two Mad Scientists talk about their latest experiments:
    
    "I crossbred a hedgehog with an earthworm. The result was: One yard of barbed wire!"  
    "Interesting. But I managed to cross a pig with a letterbox. The result: A piggybank!"
    
    -   These jokes are known behind the Iron Curtain as Michurin jokes, from Ivan Michurin, a Real Life slightly Mad Scientist known for his work on crossing (plant) species.
    
    Why did Michurin have no kids? Cause he crossed his wife's legs!
    
-   There is a joke about a man who crossed a cockroach with a watermelon — now, there is no bothering with getting the seeds out.
-   Then there's the guy who crossed a Blue Tit with an enormous pear tree, and was very disappointed to get an enormous pair of blue trees.
-   What do you get when you cross a human with a goat? Kicked out of the petting zoo.
-   What do you get when you cross a cow with an octopus? A visit from the ethics committee and immediate withdrawal of your funding.
-   Two hunters in a Kenyan bar are discussing the meanest animal in Africa, one claiming it's the lion, the other claiming it's the crocodile, and ask the bartender to play tiebreaker. The bartender tells them it's neither animal, but their offspring, the crocolion, an animal with the head and paws of a lion at one end, and the head and legs of a crocodile at the other. The hunters refuse to believe him, claiming such an animal couldn't exist, as it can't poop. "And why do you think it's the meanest animal in Africa?"
-   What do you get when you mix an Elephant with a Rhino? Elephino.

    Literature 

## By Author:

-   Chuck Tingle's writings tend to involve a man's torrid affair with such creatures as unicorns and dinosaurs to living objects such as plans or shirts and even concepts such as the Hugo Awards or the very concept of the book itself.

## By Title:

-   Subverted in _Animorphs_, due to the morphing technology that allowed Elfangor to take human form when he conceived Tobias with Loren.
-   In _Book of the New Sun_, the Undine are an alien race of beautiful albino women who are 60 feet (18.29 m) tall. They're the "Skitty"... ...the "Wailord" of this relationship are their husband/fathers Abaia and Charybdis, Eldritch Abomination that are multi-headed, tentacled horrors the size of mountain ranges and who will bring about the end of the world.
-   The _Captain Underpants_ book "The Tyrannical Retaliation of the Turbo-Toilet 2000" implies this with the offspring of a bionic hamster and a time-traveling pterodactyl. The main characters have differing reactions to this; while Harold ponders what circumstances could lead to the interspecies relationship, George is only able to repeatedly say "EWWWWWWWW!"
-   _Discworld_:
    -   In the novels, the reason for all the Mix-and-Match Critters in heraldry is because the heralds insist on drawing all the designs from life, and there's not really enough space to keep all the animals, so they get a bit...close.
    -   The wizards on Discworld never got very far in figuring out genetics, as their initial experiments in crossing garden peas and fruit flies only resulted in a green bean thing that buzzed.
    -   _Guards! Guards!_ has the swamp dragon Errol and the "king". Errol can sit on a person's shoulders while she weighs several tons and was once mistaken for a castle turret. They're not properly speaking of the same species, but they _are_ at least of _related_ species, and some real-world species show sexual dimorphism almost this extreme.
    -   It's mentioned in _Snuff_ that an unnamed dwarf and troll have set up housekeeping together. Perhaps fortunately, Vimes is cut off before he can ask the inevitable question...
    -   While actual offspring aren't mentioned, Nanny Ogg's tomcat Greebo is infamous throughout Lancre for being eager to fight and/or rape pretty much any wildlife he encounters, up to and including a she-bear which was innocently digging for roots. Apparently he once tried to rape a four-horse lumber wagon. No mention of how _that_ turned out.
-   In _The Dunwich Horror_, a human woman and an Eldritch Abomination locked out of time and space have some rather...unique offspring. For extra Squick, the woman's father may have acted as an intermediary. Thankfully, the story avoids giving us any specifics.
-   The half-human, half-bird Quetzals in _Flora Segunda_ are said to be the result of human women mating with male eagles. Even in a world with magic, it's hard to figure out how that one would work.
-   The _Gaea Trilogy_ features Titanides, creatures biologically engineered by a gigantic half (or more) mad alien, specifically based on human mythology. She gives them _three_ sets of genitalia: a horse-sized male _and_ female set on the horse half, and a human-sized male _or_ female set "in front". They are cross-fertile with humans, at least with the front set: Gaea (the alien) is _exceptionally_ good at biological engineering. The cross-breeds are... peculiar, having the basic centaur body but with human feet instead of hooves, or even stranger combinations.
-   In Glen Cook's _Garrett, P.I._ books, the main character's homeland of Karenta is full of this. Because the human empire is at war, many jobs have been filled by various creatures (trolls, dwarfs, elves, etc), all of which seem to be able to breed with each other and humans, sometimes in such variety that it's impossible to tell exactly what a creature is unless you know their great-grandparents.
-   _The Golden Flower Pot_ by E. T. A. Hoffmann is a story of a human who fell head over heels for a magical creature looking mostly like a blue eyed gold-green snake and sometimes like a human lady — a daughter of a salamander and green snake. The green snake, in turn, was a daughter of Lily and Morning-wind. The main antagonist of the book is the child of a feather from a dragon (slain by the Morning-Wind) and a sugar beet. Fairyland family trees can induce vertigo like this.
    -   His other books had all Alchemic Elementals trying to know a human closer. And one young man manipulated into unknowingly trying to romance a clockwork automaton.
-   In Arthur Machen's _The Great God Pan_, the eponymous deity impregnates a woman who was surgically modified to be able to perceive him in all his glory, and was instantly driven insane by the experience. The child was physically more human than in Lovecraft's tale, though.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Hagrid's mother was a giantess (in this universe, violent, 20-foot-tall humanoids) and his father was an ordinary, if somewhat short, human wizard. In the fourth book, he asks Madame Olympe, another half-giant, which one of her parents was the giant — so apparently, some women managed.
    -   Hagrid himself also bred manticores (creatures from Persian mythology with the head of a man, the body of a lion and the tail of a scorpion) and fire-crabs (tortoises with jeweled shells that shoot fire out their rear ends) to produce blast-ended skrewts, which resemble 10-foot, headless, armored scorpions that move by jet propulsion. In this case, more than justified by A Wizard Did It (albeit a failed one).
    -   In the Potterverse, cross-species breeding is strictly monitored by the Ministry of Magic, and experimental cross-breeding without Ministry supervision is a criminal offense.
    -   Veelas are humanoid creatures that appear to be beautiful women most of the time (and project a Charm Person effect that affects any male in the vicinity), but their real form seems to be something more akin to a siren. Nevertheless, they can breed with humans. Fleur Delacour's maternal grandmother was a Veela, and Fleur inherited a portion of her grace and beauty.
    -   Human wizards apparently can reproduce with goblins, who are much shorter than humans. Professor Flitwick, according to Rowling herself, has a dash of goblin ancestry.
    -   Averted with hippogriffs, which Hagrid seems to breed by mating them with each other. In traditional mythology they are the offspring of a horse and a griffin.
-   In Dean Koontz' urban fantasy mystery _The Haunted Earth_, the plot is driven by the offspring of a terrestrial god and an alien god, one of whom manifests as a storm.
-   In _Horton Hatches the Egg_, a half-elephant, half-bird is created by the titular elephant sitting on a bird's egg... which he had no part in creating, one might add. It's supposed to be Laser-Guided Karma: Horton did the work, so he _deserves_ to be the mother, even though that's biologically impossible.
-   In _InCryptid_, male dragons can grow to the size of a bus, while female dragons are outwardly identical to humans. One wonders how they reproduce.
-   In a nod to "The Shadow Over Innsmouth", _The Jennifer Morgue_ brings us human/Deep One hybrids. The deep ones themselves are alien fishmen, but some of the human hybrids can be startlingly attractive (which helps when breeding with humans, of course), and the protagonist muses that he now understands why some people take to solo nude snorkeling off secluded beaches... Reference is made to the rather fishy-looking and ugly residents of Innsmouth from the original story, and they are implied to be a particularly in-bred group, and would look pretty peculiar even in the absence of Deep One genes.
-   One of the books in Mercer Mayer's _Little Critter_ series entitled "Just a Little Different" has a character that has a turtle father and rabbit mother.
-   In the _Merry Gentry_ series by Laurell K Hamilton, one of Merry's partners is the son of a female (human-sized) sidhe and a male (doll-sized) pixie (the trope is actually averted since the pixie turns out to have had the ability to change from pixie to human size). Merry herself also participates in non-reproductive sexual acts with several (doll-sized) demifae.
    -   It also turns out that there is human/fey porn in the world, which gets discussed. This includes humans with the previously mentioned demifae as well as a Jack-in-Irons (a 12 foot (3.66 m) tall troll-like fey) with human partners. Notably, Merry (who brags about how much larger than normal humans her lovers are) actually turned down sex with a Jack-in-Irons once on the grounds that she wouldn't survive due to his size.
    -   There's also a minor character in the first book who's an 8 foot (2.44 m) tall, vaguely wolf-like wildfae (he was originally human who was voluntarily changed) who's mentioned as having a human wife and family.
-   There is a rather horrid image in Sir Thomas Malory's _Le Morte d'Arthur_ about a giant who has abducted the Duchess of Brittany: he hath murdered her in forcing her, and hath slit her unto the navel. Squick!
-   In _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_ it is inverted. Almost all the characters are the children of ordinary humans and Greek or Roman gods, but these gods can take any shape they like, and therefore look like particularly attractive people when they seduce humans.
-   In Mary Brown's _Pigs Don't Fly (But Dragons Do)_ the protagonist ends up making love to a dragon, who to be fair was transformed into a human for a time, but it is later revealed that he was transforming back and forth during their time together. This results in a pair of half-dragon twins being hatched by the end of the book _Draggone's Eg_.
-   _Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Supervillain:_
    -   Bull, an eight-foot tall anthropomorphic bull, has a wife, who, as far as we know, is completely human, and had a daughter with her. Penny's brain almost breaks thinking about it.
        
        **Penny:** I would just file this under "There's someone for everyone out there."
        
    -   We eventually meet his wife, Irene, in _Please Don't Tell My Parents I've Got Henchmen_. She's not a normal human—she's actually _smaller_. She's about the same size as her thirteen year-old daughter.
-   In _Reamker_ (a Cambodian poem based on _Ramayana_), Hanuman, a vanara woos Sovanna Maccha, a mermaid. They eventually had a child who is a half-vanara half-mermaid.
-   _The Reynard Cycle_: This is how the Chimera reproduce. Many of them appear to not be above kidnapping humans as unwilling lovers.
-   The issue is raised in _The Sacred Diary of Adrian Plass_, after Leonard claims that "vquex" is a valid Scrabble word, meaning "the product of a giraffe mating with a ferret".
-   In _The Silmarillion_ Morgoth the 70-foot God of Evil makes advances towards Lúthien the human-sized elf maiden. Thankfully she puts him under Forced Sleep before a non-consensual case of this occurs. Granted Morgoth can change his size but still… brr.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   Author George R.R. Martin apparently had the same mechanics-related thoughts. In the far north of Westeros, humans are occasionally abducted by giants. Abducted men have produced half-giants who have since further interbred with humans. The abducted women...don't survive.
    -   The fool Patchface survived three days at sea after a shipwreck, though he lost his mind in the process. One rumor for how he made it is that mermaids taught him how to breathe water in return for "his seed".
-   The _Star Wars Expanded Universe_ has Sith alchemy, which explains why so many species are variants of humans (and presumably capable of playing HSOWA straight), as well as why species hold physiological elements of vastly different taxa, e.g. Mon Calamari having elements of both mollusks and arthropods. Or Falleen having elements of both reptiles and mammals. Basically the Sith were really big on HSOWA.
-   _Song in the Silence_ from _Tales of Kolmar_ by Elizabeth Kerner is about a woman who, on first meeting a house-sized dragon, discovers that she possesses the capacity for Truespeech (dragon telepathy). She and the dragon fall in love they can never consummate and wrestle with the implications of this trope until the dragon is killed and mysteriously reincarnates in humanoid form.
-   The hero of Tad Williams' _The War of the Flowers_ is shepherded through Faerie by, well, a fairy. Several times people assume they're boyfriend and girlfriend, squicking him out. He later asks how such a relationship would even be possible. The answer? "Surgery." This was a Magitek universe, so this was not a flippant answer. The surgical/sorcerous procedure which could accomplish the deed was a significant plot point. Eventually, the tiny fairy does hook up with a much larger character. They have tentative plans for him to have the compatibility surgery, since it's easier going "from large to small". The hero still had trouble processing this information.
-   _The Weakness of Beatrice the Level Cap Holy Swordswoman_ has the relationship between Beatrice (human) and Boo Boo (an Iberian Orc who's four metres tall and nearly four metres _wide_). They haven't actually gotten to the point of this trope, due to Boo Boo being a Chaste Hero, but it is frequently discussed (both by Beatrice herself and by her friends). What makes this stranger is that one character claims that Iberian Orcs are capable of interbreeding with any kind of plant or animal, with no explanation of the logistics of this.
-   In one of the books in Christopher Stasheff's _A Wizard in Rhyme_ series, the wizard encounters a Dracogriff, the offspring of a male dragon and a female griffin.
-   In the _Xanth_ novels, any two species of creature are capable of breeding and having viable offspring. This is due to the abundance of unmarked, naturally occurring Love Springs, which (generally) cause unsuspecting people and animals who drink the water to immediately and involuntarily mate. It also magically ensures offspring. The result is either Mix-and-Match Critters like a centaur or a werebeast of some sort. All of the chimeric creatures in Xanth, such as mermaids, are literally the result of interspecies breeding. As this is a rather abrupt and off-putting experience, cross-species couples actually interested in enjoying the experience generally use 'Accommodation Spells'. Perhaps the best example of this is the case of Becka from _Dastard_. Her mother was a young maiden who fled into water while being pursued by a dragon. As it turned out, the water was a Love Spring and the dragon was a male...Becka is an example of the were-creature phenomenon, being able to swap between cute girl and hand-chomping dragon forms.
    -   The issues of childbirth is also averted as children are delivered by stork.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ all but the True demons are apparently partially mortal, and many have inferred this means that there was actual _breeding_ going on between them. This seems physically problematic. Two True demons have been seen — Olivikan, an enormous armored insectoid snake creature, and Illyria, a massive, taloned, armored creature with, admittedly, tentacles. Nevertheless, how exactly either of them would go about breeding with a human raises a few questions.
    
    -   It will be explained later that the true demons did not mate with humans in a natural way, but created the humanoid demons using their own kind of magic. For example, a comic shows that the first vampire was created by a true demon infecting an ordinary human with his "essence."
    
    -   Whistler, who was introduced in season 2 as a half-demon hybrid, reveals in the season 9 comics that his parents were a pure demon and one of the powers that be.
    -   In the series and the comics of _Angel_ you can see several half-demons. These invert this trope, however, because most humanoid demons are still human-like enough to mate easily. That does not apply to the parents of Nash and Pearl. They are playing this trope straight.
-   In _Eureka_, Deputy Andy, an android, has sex with SARAH, the AI of Carter's _house_. While they could have averted this by just using the finger uplink gag they used in the beginning of the episode ("wrong port"), Andy instead comes walking out of a random door as he zips up his pants. Carter and Jo can only stare in confusion.
-   Discussed in _Game of Thrones_. In Season 5, Roose Bolton conceives a child with Fat Walda, and the maesters inform him it will be a son. After Roose tells Ramsay the news as leverage against him, Ramsay uses this trope to taunt Roose, questioning how he was able to do the deed with his lady wife.
    
    **Ramsay**: So, how did you manage it?
    
    **Roose**: Manage what?
    
    **Ramsay**: Getting her pregnant.
    
    **Ramsay**: Of course, but how did you... find it?
    
-   An episode of _The Golden Girls_ featured the character Rose dreaming of a peaceful, Utopian future, one where bears would live in harmony with field mice, "But they wouldn't be able to mate or else the field mice would explode."
-   In _The Goodies_ Graeme crossbreeds dogs with other animals and then somehow dogs with household furniture in the episode Frankenfido.
-   On _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_, Herc and Iolaus befriended a mixed couple consisting of a centaur man and a human woman. And they had a son. Who was also a centaur. This is, of course, because in this show centaurs aren't really a separate species from humans. There are no female centaurs, every centaur has a human mother.
-   The titular doctor of _House_ asked this question flat-out of a patient's mother who was a little person married to an average-sized man. "He put me on top of him and spun me like a top," was her reply. Her daughter was in the room at the time, and a markedly revulsed look crossed her face. How true this was is up in question, as at the time, the woman was deeply entrenched in the Snark-to-Snark Combat with the good doctor, but the presence of their daughter is proof that they have at least done the deed.
-   _Last Man Standing_ has a more mundane/realistic version. Larabee shows up at the Baxter residence accusing Muffin, Vanessa's little lapdog, of impregnating his purebred German Shepherd, stating that he's the only male dog in the neighborhood. Mike initially needs to be convinced that Muffin is even _male_, and after being convinced that he is, questions exactly how the little dog would even be able to reach the larger dog's genitals, and is only willing to admit that Larabee's right when the two dogs demonstrate (just off-screen, of course).
-   In the final episode of _Lexx_, the titular Living Ship, dies of old age, but not before giving birth to a smaller newborn ship. The other parent that helped produce the offspring was a dragonfly. A normal dragonfly from Earth. Forget Skitty and Wailord, inches long insect and Manhattan sized insectoid spaceship is _way_ more bizarre. It helps that the ship is the woman in this situation.
-   In one episode of _QI_ (season D, episode 3) about dogs, all four panelists were given two canine plushies and asked by host Stephen Fry to show how dogs mate. Some panelists had plushies that were wildly different in size from each other. The discussion mentioned that (in theory at least) a chihuahua and a great dane could breed. Alan Davies then quipped, "They would need either a ladder or a ditch." That line then became a Running Gag throughout the remainder of the episode.
-   Subverted on _Roswell_, where a certain type of organism was used to manipulate the human and alien DNA and allow the creation of the human-Antarian hybrid children.
-   _Saturday Night Live_ did a sketch about a Hooker with a Heart of Gold who's only nine inches tall played by Tina Fey.
    
    **Priest**: Makes you wonder. How the guy upstairs fit such big heart into such a small body!  
    **Bartender**: Yeah. Also, how do guys do it with her?
    
-   _Son of Zorn_ is about an animated He-Man Expy having a child with a live-action human woman. Their son’s upper half looks like that of a normal, live-action human’s, but his bottom half is animated (however that works).
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   In the original series, Spock is the most famous example. Given that two humans can have a problem if they are of blood types, say, A+ & B-, how the heck do beings with copper- and iron-based globin get anywhere? Though some material mentions it took some technical intervention.
    -   This is mostly justified in that in one episode of TNG, the crew finds evidence that all the factions, including Klingons and Romulans, were tampered with by an ancient race with traits of all races. They found planets with evolving life and decided to step in, and force their evolution in their image.
    -   It's also further touched on directly in an episode of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_. When Dax (a Trill) announces that she and Worf (a Klingon) are going to try to have a baby, Bashir, the station's medical officer, looks crestfallen for two reasons: one, he knows Dax is truly out of his reach forever<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and two, _he's_ apparently going to be the one who has to make Trill and Klingon genetics play nicely together. He even warns Dax to not get her hopes too high, because it'll apparently be a real challenge.
    -   But apparently played straight by Voyager, since B'Elanna Torres is a Klingon/Human mix, with no indication of any special circumstances needed for her birth. In addition, the doctor engaged in some minimal but not excessive precautions for her and Tom's child (3/4 human, 1/4 Klingon).
-   One episode of _Tales from the Crypt_ reveals that the Cryptkeeper's parents were a deformed human male and a female mummy, who encountered one another in a sideshow.
-   Implied in _Tracker_, given that Mel is revealed to have Cirronian ancestry.
-   In _Xena: Warrior Princess_, human woman Ephiny marries and has a child with Phantes, a centaur man. The child is named Xenan and grows up to be an ally of Xena's.

    Music 

-   The novelty song _Buntz!_ tells of a highly acrobatic tryst between a British ship's-mascot dachshund and a classy female Afghan.
    
    _But now throughout France a new dog breed abounds:  
    The famous Marseille Afghan short-legged hound!_
    
-   Fatally averted in Eric Bogle's _Little Gomez_, in which the randy chihuahua's St. Bernard paramour got bored (and sat down) just a bit too soon. He did however bag two poodles and a labrador, and made an attempt on a wombat.
-   The song The Dragon's Lamentable Love, about a woman and a male dragon.
    
    "True love died 'cause nothing fit. That's the long and short of it."
    
-   Da Yoopers have a song called "Chiquito War", about a mosquito-chicken hybrid bred through a combination of this trope and Black Comedy Rape.
-   The Brobdingnagian Bards song "Do Virgins Taste Better?" wonders why dragons prefer kidnapping virgins to any other kind of person.
    
    "Dragons and virgins. Dragons. And virgins. The mechanics alone boggles the mind."
    
-   my mother-in-law is a scorpion, somehow a giant female scorpion mated with a male human, and gave birth to a completely human looking daughter.
-   brentalfloss' song "Link Up With Me" is a love song directed towards the Great Fairy in _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_, estimated by Brent to be five stories tall, including entreaties for "tiny Hylian/giant fairy romance".

    Myths & Religion 

-   Older Than Feudalism: Shows up a few times in Classical Mythology:
    -   Zeus, that philanderer of mythological proportions (pun very much intended) often seduced human women in the guise of animals, such as a bull or a swan. Or a shower of gold.
    -   In one particularly notable incident, Zeus transformed himself into a beautiful white bull to seduce Europa; she got on his back, and Zeus (as the bull) whisked her off to Crete. Some stories have it that Zeus changed himself back into human form to do the deed; others do not. In either case, the result was the royal line of Crete.
    -   Continuing the bulls-on-Crete theme, Minotaur was born of this sort of a union. King Minos of Crete angered the sea god Poseidon by refusing to sacrifice a bull (given to him by Poseidon for that very purpose), so Poseidon cursed his wife Queen Pasiphae to fall in love with that same bull. Daedalus, who later built the maze the Minotaur was kept in, built a hollow cow that Pasiphaë could climb in, and gave birth to the Minotaur.
    -   Aphrodite was born out of foam on the waves when Cronos — Zeus' father — threw Ouranous's, _his_ father's, penis and testicles into the sea... without the rest of him. So Aphrodite's birth is not only mind-boggling, it also shows her to be a generation older than Zeus and his siblings. Presumably, her mother is Thalassa, an obscure female personification/goddess of the sea. According to Hesiod in _Theogony_, at least.
    -   The origin of the centaurs takes the cake: Ixion was invited to Olympus by Zeus. However, Ixion intended to seduce Hera while there (a flagrant violation of Sacred Hospitality). Zeus created a cloud-woman named Nephele that looked like Hera to trick Ixion. Ixion had sex with Nephele, who gave birth to Centaurus. Centaurus, deformed and outcast, lived alone on Mount Pelion and mated with the mares that lived there, producing centaurs. And now you know!
    -   The cake above may be taken by the Happily Married couple of Echinda and Typhon. Echidna was a human snake woman who married her something-incesty husband (myths vary on what exact form of incest it is), the giant dragon/snake/man creature Typhon, who was big enough to lift mountains and battled the entire Greek Pantheon and defeated Zeus in their first battle. Their surprisingly faithful union created legendary monsters including the multi-headed dog Cerberus, the Nemean Lion, the multi-headed Hydra, the giant eagle that ate Prometheus's liver daily, and the Chimera.
-   Irish mythology: Adding to the "Top God(s) of the pantheon are kinda kinky" motif in western cultures, when God Couple The Morrigan and The Dagda meet up for an annual romantic meeting by a river, Morrigan shapeshifts into a Giant Woman so big she straddles the ford, meanwhile Dagda stays human sized. Considering both gods are known for their libidos, it's hard to say which one would've dreamed this up.
-   The Bible may or may not feature this (depending on your interpretation) in the form of the Nephilim. Angelic fathers, human mothers.
-   Many American Indian stories feature the resultant monsters of HSOWA as why species exist today.
-   In Egyptian Mythology, there was a minor fertility goddess named Tawaret, who herself was a mix-and-match-critter (she was part lioness and part hippo, with some attributes of a human female). And she, being a fertility goddess, was nearly always pregnant... and her consort was Sebek, who took the form of a crocodile. (Who was depicted variously as traveling on her back... or even literally a part of her.) Her Darker and Edgier inverse was the demoness Ammit, who devoured souls deemed "unworthy" when measured against the Feather of Ma'at.
-   Genbu, the Guardian of the North, winter, water, and a minor association with fertility... consists of a giant tortoise having sex with a giant snake. (May or may not be consensual sex, depending on whom you ask.)
-   In the mythologies of several ancient European civilizations, though it's often attributed to Greek, you have the basilisk. It is hatched by a rooster from the egg of a serpent or toad. Depictions range from giant snake (it is the King of Serpents, after all) to various snake/rooster combinations.
    -   On the flip-side, you have the cockatrice, which is created when a toad incubates the "egg" of a rooster. Depictions are similar to those of the basilisk, though they tend more towards either direct fusion (first half and legs are rooster, back half is serpent) or winged dinosaur-like forms.
-   From European Mythology, we have the Tarasque, a six-legged beast with a lion-like head and turtle shell. It's the offspring of a Bonnacon, a bull that sprays burning dung from its rear... and the Sea Monster that is the Biblical Leviathan, whose name is used to describe _absolutely massive_ stuff.
-   In Australian Aboriginal folklore, the platypus was born from the union of a duck and a water rat. Makes sense.
-   Human women marrying serpents — typically royal ones, such as princes — is a common theme in many mythologies and folk tales, including Lithuanian, Russian, and Chinese. These marriages usually result in children. Though in most tales, the serpent is a shapeshifter and can assume a human form.
    
    -   In addition to human marrying a serpent, Chinese poem Seventh Sister and the Serpent tells how the other six sisters were so envious that they tried to outdo Seventh Sister by marrying a marten, a monkey, a rabbit, a pheasant, a panther, and a tiger.
    
    **Sixth Sister** said: "Marrying a Serpent prince isn't as good as marrying a tiger!"
    
-   Some early European descriptions of African wildlife told of a beast that looked sort of like a camel with a leopard's spots, hence its name of cameleopard. We know it as the giraffe.
-   Due to a mistranslation, the animal known as the antlion (that is, it preys on ants as a lion preys on smaller animals) ended up in medieval bestiaries as a myrmecoleon, an animal born from the mating of a lion and an ant, and was doomed to starve as one parent eats meat and the other eats plants.
-   Inverted in the Greek myth of Atalanta and Hippomene, where the pair Making Love in All the Wrong Places (a temple to Zeus) caused Zeus to turn them into a pair of lions. While this might seem like an Unishment, the Ancient Greeks believed lions and lionesses could not mate with each other, splitting the lovers apart.

    Podcasts 

-   _Mission to Zyxx_ sees Dar (recognized as towering above human scale) and Nermut (a lizard person nineteen inches tall) hook up a few times.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   The Iron Sheik, gentleman that he is, once related in an interview about how he walked in on André the Giant having sex with a normal-sized woman. He likened it to a "bear fucking a rabbit, if the rabbit could get on top."
-   Alexa Bliss & Braun Strowman (Team Little Big) were literally built on this trope when they teamed together during the WWE Mixed Match Challenge. In fact, the entire basis of the team was the difference in size and constant flirtations.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Meet the Feebles_ by Peter Jackson<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> :
    -   An elephant named Sid is said to have had sexual relations with a chicken. Said chicken then brings up a paternity suit against Sid, who claims the baby isn't his ("She slept with half the chorus!"). It becomes apparent, however, that the baby was, in fact, fathered by Sid, as it's seen that the baby is a cross between a chicken and an elephant.
    -   Also the boss of the theater (a walrus) is having an affair with his secretary (a cat). On screen.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Dragons can change shape into nearly any living creature, and can mate with anything into which they change shape to produce viable half-dragon offspring. Well, _some_ dragons can change shape like that. Others... sometimes A Wizard Did It (merging traits from two species doesn't always mean there was any mating involved; just look at most of the origin stories for the owlbears), sometimes the dragon could have changed shape by learning spells that allows changing shape, and sometimes no explanation is provided.
    -   The increased amounts of splat books have brought increasingly outlandish (and Squicky) variants of the above half-dragon, such as the half-infernal and half-celestial, the half-troll, the half-illithid, and even the half-golem (though the latter two have nothing to do with parentage). Most of these, being templates that are applied to other creatures, have far too few limits on what they can be placed on.
        -   A 1/2 dragon 1/2 black pudding (think the blob) is a _canon_ creature from a module, if you really want to go "huh".
    -   Several editions of the game have talked about the fecundity of goblinoid races, which include goblins, hobgoblins, ogres, and orcs. They could easily interbreed with each other, with humanity, and with several other species. It seems that developing new monsters for the game mostly consists of finding two creatures already in the game and figuring out what happens when they have sex.
    -   See also the _Book of Erotic Fantasy_. Yes, it's a real book (though unofficial). Or "The Complete Guide to Unlawful Carnal knowledge" (includes rules for hybrid children, critical hit rules for Groin Attack, and "Porno periodical for humanoids" treasure tables). Or "Nymphology. Blue Magic." (Mongoose Publishing, Encyclopaedia Arcane series). Invariably contains mix of Fetish supplements, Mix-and-Match Critters close-up supplements, things You Do NOT Want To Know (whoever you are), and lots of jokes. The _Book of Erotic Fantasy_ actually has _a friggin' TABLE_ for this kind of thing. Complete with cloud giants and 1" tall sprites interbreeding. Brain Bleach now, please?
    -   Of course, the true madness lies in the fact that successive halves technically do nothing to dilute the effect of each one... and the half-dragon template can be applied multiple times. Counting the half-dragon possibilities listed in the _Draconomicon_, it is possible (if impractical) to create a Half Amethyst, Half Battle, Half Beast, Half Black, Half Blue, Half Brass, Half Bronze, Half Chaos, Half Chiang Lung, Half Copper, Half Crystal, Half Deep, Half Emerald, Half Ethereal, Half Fang, Half Force, Half Gold, Half Green, Half Howling, Half Li Lung, Half Lung Wang, Half Oceanus, Half Pan Lung, Half Prismatic, Half Pyroclastic, Half Radiant, Half Red, Half Rust, Half Sapphire, Half Shadow, Half Shen Lung, Half Silver, Half Song, Half Styx, Half T'ien Lung, Half Tarterian, Half Topaz, Half Tun mi Long, Half White, Half Yu Lung Dragon... Gelatinous Cube. So bad, it's awesome.
    -   But the real kick is that you can have a half-dragon _dragon_. Pink dragons (half-white reds or half-red whites) are especially powerful, as the template changes natural cold/fire vulnerability into _immunity_. An electrum dragon (half-gold, half-silver) would do the same deal... Except not be evil. And pink. Back in the 1st Edition era, a _Dragon_ article inspired by artists' color wheels proposed that the standard-issue green dragon already _is_ a product of this trope, having arisen when blue dragons mated with yellow ones. Statistics for yellow, orange, and purple versions of chromatic dragons were included.
    -   Humans also seem to be able to breed with many things as well. When a Half-X is a race and not a template, the "Half" is assumed to be human. Mr. Welch, of "Things Mr. Welch Is No Longer Allowed to Do in an RPG" fame, apparently uses this to imply that elves are easy.
    -   Green Ronin sourcebook "Bastards and Bloodlines" contains guidelines for turning anything into a half-template. Yes, anything. The cover of this book features a half-illithid drow (with both exposed cleavage and a bare midriff). It includes the half-beholder template. The first three creatures in the book are the Alicorn (Elf/Unicorn), the Aellar (Elf/GIANT EAGLE) and the Blinkling (Halfling/BLINK DOG). It is a very strange book.
    -   _Forgotten Realms_ has a share of its own.
        -   Speaking of dwarfs and elves, Myth Drannor was named so "In deference to a visionary elf of old who found the love in him to marry a dwarf." And yes, in _Forgotten Realms_ dwarfs of both sexes have beards<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , elves of both sexes don't. This one isn't too hard to imagine; unimagining it is another question. Elaine Cunningham's take on this particular combination you may see here.
        -   Of course, the experimentation justification can't be used for the Draegloth, a product of hot Drow priestess on Glabrezu action. What makes this one especially squicky is that Glabrezu are incapable of altering their appearance, meaning that someone had consensual sex with a _hideous, giant, four-armed, pincered, dog-faced_, unholy abomination of the universe. One of the Drizzt Do'Urden novels actually not-quite-_shows_ this happening. In Menzoberranzan (at least) the "valedictorian" of each class of priestesses is accorded this "honor" as part of the graduation festivities; indeed, Drizzt's sister partook of this herself when _she_ graduated (though thankfully without "offspring"), and considers "It brought me power" to be justification enough — before, during, _and_ after. Thoroughly Squicky, even though the "action" takes place off-screen.
        -   The _War of the Spider Queen_ series finally proved that the presence of **one** Draegloth is all that needed to not only turn a bunch of bickering, scheming, backstabbing drow on a mission for the sake of Religion of Evil into a party of rather likeable characters, but also do the same for another half-demon and half-shadow dragon half-drow. There are bastards, and there are... **bastards**.
        -   There's an entire House of Gold Elves who not merely played with this, but had a _crossbreeding program_, so now it consists of Daemonfey (half-fiends) and Fey-ri (tieflings). Apparently, old elven villains could be "outbastarded" only in a literal sense... The survivors of House Dlardrageth are balor's daughter Sarya, her son from a vrock Ryvvik, and son of her brother and a marilith Xhalh. Three clans of Silver Elf fey-ri joined them, though these supposedly got more of succubus or incubus blood.
        -   "The Singing Sprite" inn (Secomber) is named after its founder's wife. Because she _was_ a sprite (as in, 2' tall winged fairy) and habitually sang atop the tables. Granted, that guy, while human, _was_ a wizard...
        -   There's a half-dragon... half-remorhaz.
    -   Before 3rd Edition, humans, orcs, and ogres were all interfertile. Humans mating with either always produced half-orcs or half-ogres (who were themselves fertile with each other and all three species), but orc/ogre pairings had it differently: a female orc mating with a male ogre would produce an "orog", basically a large orc that's smarter than either of its parents, while a female ogre mating with a male orc would produce an "ogrillon", a small ogre that's less intelligent than both parents _and_ is inexplicably covered in bony nodules that give it an armor bonus; orogs are fertile but ogrillons are not. They dropped these complicated ideas in 3E and made no mention at all of orc/ogre hybrids, but orogs did return in _Forgotten Realms_ as simply a large subspecies of the main orc race. Even more confusingly, an orog in _Birthright_ was just the setting's equivalent of an orc.
    -   All that was probably the reason for doing away with half-breed templates in 4e. Wizards of the Coast parodied the template system with a fake leaked 4e Character Sheet on April 1st in 2008 with the race entry containing "Half-.../Half-.../Half-...".
    -   Second and Third Edition also had "Mongrelmen", a race of we're-not-quite-sure-whats that presumably arose through interbreeding of various humanoids. Basically the epitome of LEGO Genetics, they are patchworks of parts from different races. The supplement _Races of Destiny_ has the nonhuman asymmetry toned down to where they look like some vague demihuman of another race. A dwarf meeting a mongrelman would think he was a short elf; an elf meeting one might believe him to be a tall dwarf... the basic rule was "a mongrelman can pass for any humanoid race except the one of the person he's talking to."
    -   _Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil_ introduces half-elementals as some of the major villains, which should be impossible, because elementals are _not_ anatomically compatible with most mortal beings. (The template says that the base creature can be "any corporeal creature with an Intelligence Score of 4 or more". This can even include some undead creatures, which normally can't sire or bear children via regular means. The module _does_ say that magic and/or divine power is often involved in their birth as a way of explaining this complication.)
-   _Exalted_:
    -   Barring certain Charms, the only way for Lunar Exlated to produce beastmen is to either have sex with a human while in animal form or sex with an animal in human form.
    -   There are implications that Luna and Gaia may involve this. Luna can shapeshift into all manner of forms (some of them truly colossal) and is suggest to only really get fulfillment out of their relationship when Gaia's main bodies (some of which can be the size of planets) are around.
    -   The mutable nature of reality in general in the Wyld facilitates all manner of this. For instance, the most common ancestry of stone lions is the encounter between a lion and a rock.
    -   One Solar crafted charms to seduce a mountain. Not the mountain's god, the actual _mountain_.
-   _Munchkin_ has the Half-Breed card, for Half Anything Hybrids. Elf/dwarf? Fine. Elf/gnome? Fine. Orc/dwarf? Fine. This moves into the seriously disturbing when the Dungeon of Ridiculous Races (letting you have _as many races as you can find_) kicks in; how does being half-elf, half-orc, half-gnome, half-dwarf, and half-halfling (quarterling?) sound? Arguably even _worse_ are the 1/3-Breed and Chimera cards in the seventh expansion; 1/3-Breed lets you have three races, while Chimera means **two or more races at all times**, with the card being lost if you go below this. Whimper.
-   _Pathfinder_: A lot of the _D&D_ examples also apply, though they get played for horror with the ogres; since Pathfinder styles itself as the Darker and Edgier setting, Golarion ogres are styled for Hillbilly Horrors and they often rape their partner to death. Even if they survive, the Half-Human Hybrid of such an assault is a monstrosity known as an Ogrekin, which is always horrifically deformed. Despite the above, _Pathfinder_ goes out of its way to explain that most of the half-whatevers in the world (with the exception of half-elves and half-orcs) are a result of A Wizard Did It. That is to say, it was done via magic instead of biology, not that a wizard did it with whatever. Note that's _most_, not all, and there are still canonical instances of people mating with dragons/celestials/fiends/what-have-you.
-   _Ponyfinder_: Interspecies Romance is rare, but not unheard of, and can happen among species with considerable physical differences from one another. Viable hybrids available as player options include pony satyrs (human/pony hybrids) hippogriffs (griffon/pony), and the children of purrsians (quadrupedal winged felines) with both ponies and humans.
-   _Shadowrun_: The standard fantasy races (elf, dwarf, orc (spelled ork), and troll) are explicitly said to be human subspecies. Interbreeding is possible in any combination, although children always match one of their parents (or sometimes revert to human); there are no mixtures. There is flavor text to the effect that a dwarf carrying a troll fetus would probably need major medical assistance to complete the pregnancy.
-   _Warhammer_: During the End Times, the supplement books introduce Orgoth Daemonspew, whose claim to fame is that he's half daemon by birth. His mom was a human witch while his dad was a _Great Unclean One_, who's essentially a 20 foot (6.1 m) tall mountain of rotting fat.

    Theater 

-   In _Into the Woods_, it's _heavily_ implied that Jack gets it on in some manner with the Giantess at the top of the beanstalk (the line is "And she gave me food and she gave me rest, and she drew me close to her giant breast"). It's also pretty clear that the Big Bad Wolf intends to rape Little Red Riding Hood. And her Granny.

    Video Games 

-   Half-Ogres from _Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magick Obscura_ plays the size differences between the two races in a rather dark light... If the female's the human, at any rate. The pre-created Half-Ogre player character is described as the offspring of a human male and an ogress with 'exotic tastes'.
-   In _Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal_, the god Bhaal is revealed to have had children with everything from chinchillas to dragons and giants in his attempt to cheat death. This ability seems to have been passed down to his offspring; his son Yaga-Shura, a fire giant, tries have a child with a human woman. Bear in mind that fire giants are 12 ft (3.6 m). tall and around 7000 lbs (3100 kg). A player character who isn't a dwarf (as no one romances them) can bear children with elves. Albeit, gnomes and half-orcs (with the official patch) are stuck to Aerie and Viconia, respectively and exclusively. And Viconia wont dally with an elf unlike the other potential romances.
-   In _BlazBlue_, Kokonoe is the offspring of Jubei, who's a talking cat that's about the size of an average housecat, and Nine the Phantom, a human witch.
-   In _BloodRayne 2_, there is a gargantuan female vampire known as Sleez that refers to Kagan (a human-sized male vampire) as "her love". Given that Kagan is established to have bred with countless different women to create more powerful vampire children and that several of Slezz's offspring are used as test subjects by their siblings, the possibility he somehow copulated with her is not ruled out.
-   In _Devil May Cry_ Greater-Scope Paragon Sparda, a insectoid-looking demon knight with no visible genitalia<small>◊</small> got Eva his human wife pregnant with twins Dante and Vergil. We can hopefully assume he did so using his human form… unless it was a _The Shape of Water_ situation. Worth noting Sparda was apparently an immensely attractive Sex God by demon standards with the demoness Nevan (who’s human-shaped) in _DMC3_ remembering her time with Sparda with nostalgic lust.
-   In most iterations of the _Digimon_ franchise, Digimon are usually sexless creatures born from data. However, one notable exception exists in _Digimon World Dawn/Dusk_, in the form of "matching". Two Digimon from two copies of the game can be used to create a new Digi-Egg, and in some cases it's the only way to get certain species in some versions of the game. However, unlike Pokemon, it's less reliant on actual species; any two digimon can match, and getting specific kinds of eggs requires matching two digimon belonging to very broad categories (such as "Dark", "Plant", or "Dragon") as well as specific stats.
-   The early _Dragon Quest Monsters_ games are the lords of this trope. While monsters are grouped into families based on type, any matchup will succeed as long as the prospective parents are of opposite genders. Dragons and birds, undead and plants, slimes and animated objects, and the offspring will nearly always be something other than either of its parents. On top of that, the child will have the potential to learn all powers of its species, all powers of both parents' species, and any powers either parent knew at the time of conception, allowing for some truly evil twinking.
    -   The series revises the breeding mechanic in _Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker_ and seems to solve the problem. Instead of each monster being male or female, they can be Positive, Negative, or Neutral, and the process is known as "Synthesis". Synthesis requires a positive and negative monster, with a neutral monster substitutable for both (however, you _cannot_ synthesize two neutral monsters). Imagine the two monsters you pick being pureed in a blender, then having the concoction froze into a new monster. This could explain why you lose your monsters after synthesis.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   There are 17 sub-breeds of the Khajiit, with the phases of the moons determining which one they will become. At birth, they're almost indistinguishable from plain old regular kittens, but what they will become as adults becomes obvious fairly quickly. These sub-breeds can supposedly range in size from house cats, to a number of variations of humanoid Cat Folk, to outright tigers large enough to be ridden as steeds in battle. Additionally, the offspring any pairing produces has nothing to do with the parent subspecies, but rather, the phases of the moons under which they are born.
    -   Several in-game books and backstory details state that each race of Men (Imperial, Breton, Redguard, Nord) and Mer ("Elves" - Altmer, Dunmer, Bosmer, Orsimer) can indeed interbreed, with the race of the offspring being virtually identical to the mother (averting All Genes Are Codominant) with a few of the father's traits potentially sprinkled in.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  These races can vary greatly in size and appearance. There are reports of _Giants_ and _Ogres_ interbreeding and producing offspring with the other races of Tamriel, of whom even the largest are at most half the size of an average Giant or Ogre.
    -   Though unconfirmed by modern scholars, it is believed that the Minotaur race is the result of Saint Alessia (a human woman) having a romance with the Aedric half-bull demigod Morihaus.
    -   While there are no examples of offspring being produced by a Khajiit pairing with a race of Man or Mer, there are several examples of those races at least having sex with a Khajiit. Like real-life cats, male Khajiit have _spines_ on their penises, which obviously make the act extremely uncomfortable for a female. The original _The Real Barenziah_ in _Daggerfall_ has a (very NSFW) scene with a Khajiit and the titular Dunmer princess where this detail comes up. The book appears in the later games, but said scene is unsurprisingly censored (both in-game and in-universe). Additionally, in _Morrowind_, there is an option Romance Sidequest line with a female Khajiit named Ahnassi, though the relationship is only implied. _Morrowind_ also has an easily missable throw-away line hinting at this trope: in Suran, there is the "House of Earthly Delights," which is essentially a strip club. If the Player Character is a male Khajiit, one of the strippers will comment "Not another Khajiit. I'm still smarting from the last one."
    -   One race that is not believed to be able to interbreed with the others are the egg-laying Argonians. However, that doesn't stop _sex_ from happening. One book introduced in _Morrowind_ (and reappearing in every game since) is "The Lusty Argonian Maid," in which an Imperial male and the titular Argonian maid...treat the subject from a different standpoint. ("Polish my spear" indeed...) with the Argonian maid taking the Imperial's innuendos quite literally.
    -   _Oblivion_ has Agronak gro-Malog, "the Gray Prince", who is half-orc, half-human. Or, as it turns out, half-human _vampire_. The result is a non-vampiric, but _very_ pale Orc.
    -   In _Skyrim_, Hadvar makes a joke about this upon finding out that the Player Character is the Dragonborn (a mortal with a dragon's soul and powers).
        
        **Hadvar**: "'Dragonborn', huh? Was it your ma or your pa that was the dragon?"
        
    -   Lyris Titanborn in _The Elder Scrolls Online_ has giant somewhere in her lineage, which led to the death of her mother. She thought her father blamed her for the death, but he blamed himself for not being careful.
        
        **Gjalder**: The blood of giants flows through my veins. Your mother was a Nord. I gave her my seed without thought for her safety. That's why she died. Not because of you, child. Because of me!
        
-   _Final Fantasy_: "The blood of giants flows through my veins. Your mother was a Nord. I gave her my seed without thought for her safety. That's why she died. Not because of you, child. Because of me!"
    -   Terra from _Final Fantasy VI_ is a half-human, half-Esper hybrid. Madeline (Madonna in the SNES version) is an ordinary human female who wandered into the Esper World by accident; Maduin is an enormous Gigas/satyr-like Esper who barely looks humanoid. The narrative does away with the particulars by having the same-sized sprites perform a sparkly dance, at the end of which their sparks join together in the shape of a baby. Awww.
    -   Acquiring colored chocobos in _Final Fantasy VII_ requires you to breed chocobos you've captured and leveled up. Despite the squickiness, breeding their children, this a mild example and pretty much what people do in real life.
        -   This is also pretty much how real specialized breeding works. There's a good reason purebred dogs have so many genetic disorders...
        -   Forget Chocobos; Hojo tries to breed Aerith (a 22-year-old human woman) and Red XIII (a talking lion) together, causing HSOWA and Mate or Die in one scene (Keep in mind, Hojo is a Mad Scientist who has already infused dozens of people with alien DNA (some in utero) and pumped Vincent Valentine so full of monster genes that he's now an immortal shape-shifter).
    -   Word of God in _Final Fantasy XIV_ states that all of the five original playable races can interbreed with one another. This includes the diminutive Lalafell, who tend to cap out at around three feet in height, and the massive Roegadyn, a race where 6'5" (2m) would be considered short.
        -   In the lore, there's the claim that this universe's version of Shiva "laid with a dragon", making her the most heinous heretic of Ishgard's dragon-hating society. You eventually learn this is probably just them further demonizing her, as while she was genuinely and truly in love with the dragon Hraesvelgr (who loved her back just as much), he's the size of a tractor-trailer truck while she was a regular Elezen, so the odds of them having actually consummated are... pretty unlikely. The fact that dragons reproduce asexually also puts a damper on the idea.
-   _Flight Rising_'s dragon-breeding mechanic can run into this if you're paying attention. Try pairing a male Imperial<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  or Guardian<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  with a female Fae<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> !
-   In _God of War_ The Titan Cronos is a giant big enough to strap an entire building to. _God of War II_ shows his wife, Rhea, as the size of a normal human.
-   _Hades_ features the titular god of the Underworld who in this telling is a Hulk-esque three meter tall while his wife Persephone is human-sized, yet they were able to produce their son Zargeus (he was a still born at first but was revived). Of course given Persephone is a goddess this is far easier to accept than other examples.
-   The monsters of _Jade Cocoon_ can be merged with one another, creating interesting Mix-and-Match Critters.
-   A human/human example in _Jak and Daxter_: Krew, who is so ludicrously huge that he needs a hover chair to move around, managed to have a kid. The sheer mechanics of it are mind-boggling!
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   The asari are a humanlike race which can mate with any species and produce viable offspring. This is gotten around by intercourse not being strictly necessary, that the asari and their partner temporarily merge the bio-electricity of their nervous systems and the asari uses the effect of that to randomize a parthenogenic(self-generated) offspring. One asari mentions a past relationship with an elcor, an alien race that can be described as an intelligent flat-faced hippopotamus. Peebee, a squadmate in _Mass Effect: Andromeda_ is the daughter of an asari-elcor couple.
    -   Played for laughs after Grunt's loyalty mission if you kill the thresher maw. EDI mentions that the feat has sprouted several breeding requests for Grunt, and one for Shepard (which happens regardless of the player's gender). Bear in mind that everybody on that planet is, like Grunt, a krogan. Your average Krogan looks like this<small>◊</small>. There are also at least two confirmed asari who have had children with krogan. Which actually makes more sense than it seems, since as both races live for centuries a match with any other alien race is doomed to be tragically short.
    -   In 3, Liara's father (also asari) had a child with a hanar, a jellyfish like alien. During Blasto, the titular hanar gets some action with an elcor.
    -   Also, a FemShep who has romanced Garrus since _Mass Effect 2_ can get a dialogue scene near the end in which he mentions wanting to find out "what a turian-human baby looks like." This is the only one that would be according to the game world, impossible, as cross-breeding by different genomes can't happen, and even if it could, turians have Mirror Chemistry and cannot even digest human food.
-   Related to World of Darkness's aversion to this trope, people in _The Matrix Online_ have roleplayed Exiles which were a mess of hybridization, including a part vampire, part succubus, part Valkyrie mongrel. Might be justified since it's all code in a virtual world.
-   Neil Cicierega's _Monster Breeder_ has few actual restrictions on which of the "original" monster types you breed, mostly in the form of the Blob eating things. This is a list including gremlins (which seem to be based on the movie, based on tags, making them about the size of a dog) and leprechauns (presumably the size of a little person) at one end of the scale, and the _Loch Ness Monster_ at the other; you can't even _catch_ Nessie unless you buy a vehicle upgrade so you have room. (The results are a "Gremnessie" and a "Lochnechaun", in case you were curious.)
-   _Monster Girl Quest_ has monsters being a One-Gender Race who need human men to reproduce. Note that monsters range from tiny fairies to Kaiju-sized (one example being the Kyoryuu, a giant dragon who has _trees growing on her back_).
-   _Mortal Kombat_ gives us the Shokan, a race of half-human/half-dragon hybrids.
-   On the _Neopets_ website, there's a book that lampshades the oddity of Neopian family lines, such as a Skeith (a dragon) and a Zafara (a dragon-like canine) having a Lupe, an Ixi, and a Gelert (a wolf, a goat and a dog) as their offspring.
-   _NeoQuest II_ has this with pretty much every NPC that has children. For example, in a village in Chapter 3, one family is made up of an Acara (a cat/goat hybrid) father and a Wocky (fox) mother, who have children who are a Cybunny (rabbit) and an Uni (unicorn).
-   In the _NiGHTS_ series of games Nightopians and Nightmarens, two completely different species, can create an unholy Mepian hybrid. Try not to think about it too much.
-   _Octodad_. Octodad is... an octopus masquerading as a human, and his wife is human. Their two children are also human. At the end of the sequel once the secret is finally revealed to the family (though the daughter already knew), the son wonders how he and his sister came to be from this marriage.
-   The _Parappa The Rapper_ universe is implied to work this way by Word of God, though the results haven't been hinted at.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   A majority of the 900+ Pokémon are divided into 15 "egg groups" based loosely on biological niches and appearances, such as "Bug," "Mineral," or "Fairy;" only Pokémon that share an egg group can produce offspring. Theoretically, this should help curb this trope so that only Pokémon that are sufficiently alike can breed. In practice, the categories are still too broad to actually enforce this. Even the "Water" category, which is split into three subcategories (amphibious, vertebrate, and invertebrate) is subject to this, and so the jellyfish-like Tentacool can mate with the coral-like Corsola because they're both in the "Water 3" group.
    -   The series as a whole provides an extreme example with the Trope Namers: Skitty is a two-foot tall housecat-like Mon, and Wailord is a forty-seven-foot long _whale_. Yet because the game places both of them in compatible breeding groups, a player can pair them up and produce viable offspring of either gender. (Bulbapedia, the largest Pokémon wiki, even describes the term's etymology in further depth for those interested.)
    -   And sometimes the egg group placements just don't make any sense, even when viewed only in the context of a single Pokémon. Gardevoir's family appears human-like, but until _Pokémon Sword and Shield_, it wasn't in the "Human-like" egg group. It was only in the "Amorphous" group, which is primarily given to Blob Monsters like Muk and Slugma or gaseous Pokémon like Gastly and Castform.
    -   Taken up to eleven with the pairing of Pokémon that prey upon each other or are natural enemies in the wild, like Zangoose and Seviper or Mareanie and Corsola.
-   In _Princess Maker 2_, one of the potential suitors you can get is a dragon. Now, he can at least transform to a human form, but the implications are still a little bit uncomfortable.
-   Demons in the _Shin Megami Tensei_ games can be fused with one another, or in some games simply sacrificed, to create new demons. As demons don't gain much power through play, unlike the human characters, this is the only alternative to negotiating with more powerful creatures.
    -   In _Shin Megami Tensei IMAGINE_ it's explained further, the demons lose their physical forms and their Magnetite (Energy) is fused to create a new form.
    -   Averted two separate ways in _Persona_: In the first and second ones (Persona 2 is a duology), you simply acquire "cards" (small fragments of energy) from demons, which you then make into Personas. In _Persona 3_ and _Persona 4_, the "Personas" are just shards of your personality, not independent lifeforms.
-   _Sonic Adventure_ and its sequel both include Chao gardens. Chao may be trained and any two may be crossed, with the usual Lamarckian mechanics coming into play. This doesn't affect anything outside of the garden, though.
-   In _Stellaris_, taking Xeno-Compatibility ascension perk allows different species to start making new half-breed pops, even if the combination can seem bizarre like fungoids mating with avians. However, this is averted with lithoids, who can only do this with other lithoids.
-   The piñatas of _Viva Piñata_ could be bred (I'm sorry, _romanced_) to produce offspring—this was a key point of the game. In most instances, piñatas were disinterested in those outside their own species, which avoided such Skitty and Wailord moments, but in one instance apparently-unlikely cross-species breeding could occur. The swan piñata Swanana and the pig piñata Rashberry could have hybrid offspring when certain requirements were met, producing the winged pig Pigxie. Which the parent species were apparently so ashamed of that they'd start fights with it. Even the in-game encyclopedia refers to this offspring as a horrible mistake. Unfortunately, there were only a few clues in the game as to how to breed this hybrid piñata, leading to another instance of Guide Dang It! to figure out how.
    -   Some of the requirements for the Swanana, which include building it a house, setting up a fountain, and giving it an expensive necklace, led to the remark, "The things I have to do for a pig's trophy wife."
-   The _Warcraft_ 'verse has Malorne the stag god falling in love with Elune, the night elven moon goddess. Their offspring Cenarius, a stag/elf demigod, was then raised by Ysera the dragon. Cenarius' son Zaetar then fell in love with the earth elemental princess Theradras, which led to the birth of the brutish centaur race.
-   One weird example in _World of Warcraft_ is Anara and Azuregos; he's a blue dragon, and she's a _spirit healer_. (Azuregos is first seen when he's hiding out in the Spirit World, a sort of in-between place used by deceased to enter the afterlife, or possibly return to the mortal world; he's unwilling to go either way, because he's in love with Anara.)
    -   Azuregos hangs a lampshade on the trope when discussing his relationship with Anara:

    Web Animation 

-   Tom from _Eddsworld_ gets his hair from his father and his Eyeless Face from his mother. Said father and mother are a pineapple and a bowling ball respectively.
-   Presumably how the title character of _Satina_ came about. Being that her father is an average human, and her mother is a demon who is _at least_ 7 meters (Or 22 feet) tall.
-   The _Team Fortress 2_ fan video Spy and Pyro starts off as what seems like a TF2 parody of _Looney Tunes_, but then becomes a sex story between BLU Spy and RED Pyro. The video ends with Pyro giving birth to Spyro the Dragon (Get it? Spy + Pyro = Spyro).

    Webcomics 

-   _8-Bit Theater_:
    -   It has a "Hot Monster on Red Mage action" with the result, that Red Mage himself was turned into the monster's offspring. The monster, of course, was a lot taller than RM, so that it first looked more like it was trying to squeeze him, rather than to rape him. It was explained by the monster having a third gender to "impregnate" (or rather, transform) other species.
    -   And the less said about the Hot Witch on Dragon-God-King Action that occurred earlier, the better. Notable for horrifying the protagonists, individuals who are most commonly horrifying others with their actions.
    -   Lich, an animated skeleton, has an apparently human wife and his son Vilbert is a _vampire_. This is eventually called into question and it's mentioned it involved Mind Control at some point.
-   Averted in a couple of ways in _21st Century Fox_ with minor character Veronica, who is a vampire bat. It's stated she was in an internet relationship with Cecil, a giraffe, before the beginning of the series. She explains a few times that's why a more physical relationship wouldn't be feasible. Later in the comic she gets in a relationship with another minor character, a mouse, and they discuss children opportunities... adoption or getting the father's genes transferred gene by gene to the mother's species.
-   _Chainmail Bikini_ had the Munchkin character Josh created that was one-third human, one-third Drow and one-third Ogre. The other players note that this is physically impossible, which Josh himself doesn't care about. So page #10 is called "Three's Company" and the last panel is a hilariously dubious image of how it'd "work".
-   _The Comic Adventures of Left & Right_: Owldog's father is a giant talking owl and his mother is a dog.
-   Lampshaded in _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_ in an exposition strip which mentions a dragon and an anthro-canine who got married and have two children. The author vociferously refuses to answer the inevitable question, though there's an obvious answer given that the one known dragon in the series, Pyroduck, has been passing himself as a humanoid being for most of the series.
    -   The same kind of explanation is used for half-dragons in _Drowtales: The Moonless Age_ , and various Tabletop Games settings.
    -   Also in _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_, a character in the story is a Kangaroo Rat, and has several half-Kangaroo Rat sisters. The "half", however, is taken both ways, as his sisters are all _Kangaroos_. Their parents are a Kangaroo Rat and Kangaroo (see Marshmallow Hell for details).
    -   This strip explains that the children of Taur and Biped couples will always take after the mother. Apparently it's due to Amber's Fridge Horror considering how painful it would be for a biped to give birth to a taur.
-   The _World of Warcraft_ fancomic _Druids_ features a male Tauren and a female Worgen couple. And if that's too much there's one arc where she gets raped by a dragon.
-   Myces from _Fairy Dust_ has a 40cm fairy mother and a 2,20m troll father. How they managed to conceive is a question that was asked, but never answered.
-   Lampshaded in _Gorgeous Princess Creamy Beamy_:
    
    "Then why is her belly not distended with a squirming brood of grubspawn?"  
    "Because I'm not from this planet! Our biochemistry is totally different! He'd have more chance trying to impregnate a native _plant_ than he would me!"  
    "And even that would be impossible! I used to do it with fruit all the time and nothing came of it!"
    
-   _Grrl Power_: Sydney starts dating Frix, who's 6-7 feet tall, and comes from a race where the women are 9+ feet tall. Sydney herself is closer to 5'0". Eventually, she asks Dabbler if there's something that can help with the 'proportion' issue; Dabbler confesses that she prepared a solution once _she_ heard they were dating. Also, Frix already had some experience with the particular solution used.
-   In _Gunnerkrigg Court_ a cross between humans and _Fire Elementals_ is apparently possible.
    
    **Coyote:** What an interesting first union that must have been!
    
-   In _Jack_, almost every character is an anthro, so crossbreeding is just expected to happen. Oddly, though, it seems not only mammals, but also amphibians, reptiles and _insect_ anthros can crossbreed freely, and the parents features somewhat scramble in the offspring. The obvious result is that few of the "mortal" characters are totally "purebreed".
    -   The "Case Of The Travelling Corpse" points out that most species prefer to breed/interact within their own species like the killer. Still, crossbreed families are pretty normal. The child of a mammal and an insect usually ends up looking cute, green and mostly non-insect, for example.
    -   Given the backstory, this becomes more plausible as all the anthro races were deliberately engineered by humans some time in the past, and are probably human inside with cosmetic changes on the outside.
-   In _Kevin & Kell_, it seems that even being of the same taxonomic order or class is not necessary for successful cross-species matings. The fox/wolf cross (Rudy) almost seems ordinary when seen with the rabbit/wolf cross (Coney), the wolf/sheep cross (Corrie), the fennec fox/formerly human rabbit cross (Francis), the tortoise/weasel cross (not named in the strip), or the bat/formerly human hedgehog cross (Turvy).
-   _Last Res0rt_ gets in on it too; the Celeste apparently consist of nothing BUT Hybrid Monster people who breed with all the other species within the comic to make more hybrids. And then they add WINGS on top of all that.
-   In a oneshot comic named Meeting the...Parents?, a "tigerpixie" — an anthropomorphic tigress with insect wings and antennae — introduces her boyfriend to her parents: a huge tiger and some finger-sized insect.
    
    **Lizard boyfriend:** Welp... This answers some questions, but raises so many new ones...
    
-   One _The Order of the Stick_ comic showed the inherent Squick of family life as a half-orc, the joke being that, in D&D, half-orcs are considered a little bit squicky because they're implied to usually be the result of rape, while in the comic, the kid is squicked because her parents are sickeningly, mushily in love.
    
    -   They also contemplated the origin of the legendary Owlbear. When Elan suggested that an owl and a bear mated, Belkar expressed hope that the owl was the male in the relationship, as otherwise certain problems would surely arise.
    -   #721 reveals Enor the bounty hunter to be a hybrid of a ogre and a dragon.
    -   The Ancient Black Dragon is related to at least three half-dragons, one of which seems to be a half-dragon centaur.
    -   One of the strips made for _Dragon_ magazine features a vampiric half-dragon half-troll lycanthropic fiendish snail.
    
    **Snail:** "Tremble at my illogical glory!"
    
-   _Sabrina Online_ has this in spades.
    -   Sabrina's boss is a skunk with stripes because her grandfather was a white tiger.
    -   Thomas is a part wolf, part fox hybrid. And when Amy becomes pregnant with his child...
        
        **Amy:** Back in prehistoric times, when we were little more than animals, a squirrel like me would only be prey to a wolf like you. But today, we're two different species, but we're also a couple, and I'm carrying our child. Kind of interesting, zoologically speaking.  
        **Thomas:** Zoologically speaking, shouldn't this also be impossible?  
        **Amy:** Well, that's why we have comic strips.
        
    -   But if that wasn't disturbing enough already, Tom's lupine father drops this piece of advice for Amy:
        
        Hope the kid doesn't take after my side of the family, or you're in for a ride, girl!
        
    -   There is also the side-character, Carly the Chinchilla, who also married a wolf _much_ taller and broader than her.
    -   And Sabrina married a raccoon, producing their own raccoon/skunk hybrid.
-   The races of Medius from _Slightly Damned_ are all able to breed with each other to make hybrid offspring that are usually but not always sterile and have features of both parents, called mixlings or bitzas. This is surprising because several of the races (possibly all of them except humans, and including jakkai despite looking mammalian) reproduce by laying eggs. It also is weird when you learn than merfolk in this setting are based on sea slugs rather than fish, and the fact that fairies appear to be too small to breed with other races. The page on the comic's website that explains this has a drawing of a cross between a fairy and a khamega (who resemble giant bipedal turtles). It is unknown if the same rules apply to angels and demons (also egg layers), who aren't native to Medius. One character expresses interest in seeing what Buwaro's (fire demon) and Kieri's (water angel) theoretical child would look if it is possible.
    -   Romantic relationships between demons of different elements seem to be fairly common despite the physical differences, with the largest demons (eatth) are over 12 feet tall and the smallest (water) just being around 5 feet tall. Word of God has stated that when demons of different elements have children they usually have the father's element but occasionally will be the same as the mother.
    -   The twelve divine guardian animals are also able to breed with the races of Medius, although they can each turn into one of the races so it's more justified. This is an important plot point. It's later revealed that the reason why Rhea was killed in the beginning of the story is because she is descended from one of the guardians, specifically Moku the snake, because the villain's plan involves killing the guardians and anyone descended from them. Heathcliff Sinclair may also be descended from one of the guardians, but denies it.
    -   This is Averted in the author's other comic _The Junk Hyenas Diner_. It is impossible for interspecies couples to have kids, with the exception of human/mutant pairings since mutants are descended from humans, so interspecies couples just adopt. This makes sense since it is a science fiction comic unlike Slightly Damned.
-   In _Space Trawler_, Dimitri is basically seducing his way through the galaxy, hitting on and usually sleeping with basically anything female, sapient, and consenting who can physically mate with a human. We're not talking Green-Skinned Space Babes either. We're talking a woman who looks like a bright pink cross between an anteater and a giraffe, a green egg-shaped insect alien with antennae, an orange person with a worm-shaped head and gills (although also with a bangin', suspiciously humanoid body in a form-fitting jumpsuit), and a mauve creature with a profusion of long thin prehensile tentacles on the bottom and a tall, _glowing_ cylindrical appendage on top. Link. Among others. Many others.
    
    **Choan:** What about the furry-faced one?  
    **Nogg:** Him? Dimitri will sleep with anything that has a sexual compatibility index over 50%.  
    **Choan:** Is Nogg correct, Dimitri? You and I have a 74% compatibility.  
    **Dimitri:** A beauty like you? How could I say no?  
    **Choan:** I'll see you after dinner in my quarters then.
    
-   Subverted in _Tally Road_—after several sexual exploits that are plainly cross-species, the first time any sex with like-species individuals occurs, the guy's seen putting on a condom. Apparently cross-species pairings are infertile.
-   “TinderSkitty” is about an anthropomorphized Skitty and Wailord who are head-over-heels for each other.
-   _TwoKinds_:
    -   Double Subverted. There are three civilized races in the setting; Humans, Keidran, and Basitin. As far as anyone knows, breeding between the races is impossible. _Until_ Flora, the human main character's keidran wife, somehow becomes pregnant with his child. It's implied this is because of divine intervention, with one of the powers-that-be allowing it to happen instead of preventing it as has been done up to this point.
    -   Also happened with Raine's parents. Her mother was a templar, her father was a Keidran who had mastered the ability to perfectly transform himself into a human. They had sex and her mother got pregnant, and was _very_ surprised to deliver a Keidran-looking child. Raine inherited her father's ability, but can't control it, and will revert to her Keidran form without magic suppressing items.
    -   Played straight with Princess Reni's grandparents, a dragon and a human princess. Reni would much rather not contemplate the mechanics of their union.
-   _VG Cats_: And that's where the robot skeletons in Doom 3 came from!
-   _Yet Another Fantasy Gamer Comic_:
    -   Gren (a goblin) and Bob (a Beholder). How does that even work? A sketch on the site shows their hypothetical offspring from a scrapped storyline wherein Gren would have a nightmare about her future children. It could charitably be described as Ugly Cute.
    -   Another instance has the lonely minotaur character decides to stay and live with the lonely gynosphinx character ten times his size. In his own words, "With magic, anything is possible." Though this was less about _mating_ and more about companionship (and the Sphinx's gazongas being big enough that the minotaur could fit his whole body between them). Eventually the question is answered: sphinxes know magic, and she turns one of them into the other's species when they're feeling... affectionate.

-   Poster "Bloodlines. Answering the questions you never wanted asked.<small>◊</small>", possibly referring to "Bastards and Bloodlines" (see above).
-   Invoked twice in Chorocojo's Lets Plays of _Pokémon_ games: in his Emerald run Misty throws a Seviper and a Pikachu into the daycare to see what happens (it's implied Seviper ate Pikachu) and in Fire Red Sammy likes watching a show called _Will They Breed_, and they were showing whether a Croconaw and Kirlia could breed when the show is interrupted by breaking news of Silph Co. being invaded by Team Rocket.
-   In _Farce of the Three Kingdoms,_ Sima Zhao manages to reproduce with Lady Wang, a normal human. Their sons are You, who takes after his mother, and Yan, who is a more visibly Half-Human Hybrid. How Sima Yi managed to _father_ Zhao is entirely unexplained.
-   There's a trio of Mons-based web roleplaying games, unofficially known as the _Hidden Crossroads_, that use this trope. The first such site allows for any two creatures to breed via a special item; the results are Mix-and-Match Critters. The other two sites have several different types of Mons that can only be obtained via breeding, but they're all variants on the same species.
-   _Looming Gaia_: While most species can't produce hybrids, demons can have children with any people with souls (except for nymphs, who are infertile). This includes gnomes, who are several times smaller than them, though it's very rare.
-   The series of artwork (often NSFW) about adventurers by Fredrik K.T. Andersson (author of _Pawn_) includes a character best described<small>◊</small> as "Bard who knocks up _every critter in creation_". And is so much surprised by the results one may suspect he was drunk half-blind during those encounters. This one<small>◊</small> is safe-for-work, if potentially hurtful for a brain. Of all living beings he had troubles only with elves. Also, there's "Dragon and Succubus". Speaking of which—
    
    **Elf Ranger:** And _what_ part of "_naked chick_ standing on top of a _dead dragon_" didn't say _major demon_ to you?!  
    **Human Bard:** _\[lifted off the ground by a happy embrace of "chick" with hooves and spiked tail\]_ uhm... the "naked chick" bit... ?
    
-   A Let's Play of _Pokémon Mystery Dungeon_ lampshaded the cross-chain breeding found in the core series. After Jake and Sheldon rescue a Plusle and Minun pair (the latter named Hankosha) and rescuing a Magikarp (who is also named Hankosha), the Magikarp explained that the Minun is his great grandson. The author then added:
    
    And to those wondering: Hankosha + Feebas female (both Dragon egg group) = Feebas male + Marill female (both Water 1 egg group) = Marill male + Minun female (both Fairy egg group) = Hankosha.
    
-   _Tigtone_ features the Fertile Centaur, who manages to impregnate a Queen Bee, among many other things.
-   Duckyworth, while reviewing _The Wild_ (formerly his most hated film until _Eight Crazy Nights_), he gets horrified by thinking what would happen if Bridgett (a giraffe) and Benny (a squirrel) got together, by imagining a mutant giraffe/squirrel-mishmash.

    Web Videos 

-   _Dream SMP_: Wilbur, a (presumed) human, apparently had sex with Sally, a _salmon_, at one point, and he himself the product of a relationship between Philza (a Winged Humanoid) and a _Samsung smart fridge_. Even weirder, his son with Sally is a humanoid _fox_. The fandom (and Phil) has tried to explain this by assuming both women had shapeshifting powers, but Wilbur the content creator is _very_ adamant that no, his character fucked an actual fish and Phil's character fucked an actual fridge.
-   The very end of The Nostalgia Critic's review of _Zeus and Roxanne_ showed half-dog and half-dolphin offspring of the two titular animals.
-   When Little One in _Tales From My D&D Campaign_ has to explain that his mother was a dragon, one of the other players brings up this trope. However, Little One explains that dragons can assume human form if they so desire.

    Western Animation 

-   A series of Tex Avery cartoons asserted that the car, home and farm "of tomorrow" would include crossbreeds of both living beings and inanimate objects— corn crossed with Mexican jumping beans to make it hop into your mouth, etc.
-   In _The Amazing World of Gumball_, Interspecies Romance is quite regular in Elmore, and the children can be either parents' species. Some of these pairings are rather strange (the main character is a cat who loves a fairy) or problematic (one student is a cactus in love with a balloon, who she's in constant danger of popping). A few very much beg the question of mechanical possibility: Jamie's dad is a small green humanoid, but her mom is a cube more than two meters to each side. Even stranger, Hector's mom is a witch much smaller than a human while his father is a giant said to be so huge people get lost in his _belly-button_. It must have been really, really painful getting the baby in and out.
-   In the "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue of _Amphibia_, it is revealed that Bessie, a snail, and Joe Sparrow, a sparrow, mated and had a few snail/sparrow hybrids called “snirds.”
-   _Ben 10: Alien Force_ introduces the Half-Human Hybrid Plumber kids; all of them being, well, alien hybrids. One of the first ones seen is half Pyronite, half human. Pyronites are beings made of magma, are constantly on fire, and live on a _sun_. The only mix that might be weirder would be a half Galvan (Greymatter), what with a Galvan being a six-inch tall, bug-eyed, grey alien...
    -   Though the weirdest has to be Gwen. An energy being? How'd that work? One can only guess it was halfway between the standard fashion and magical creation.
        -   Gwen is one relative removed from that lineage. Her father is the son of Max Tennyson and Verdona, her energy-being grandmother. As Verdona demonstrates, she can outright warp reality on a whim. Creating human organs was probably simple. The "spark", as she called it, carried on in her offspring from that point.
        -   It gets weirder when you realise that said "spark" won't necceserily 'take'; Besides Verdona, Gwen is the only member of the family with Andonite powers, the rest (including Ben) being merely carriers.
    -   Not only that, but Ben HSOWA's the entire High Breed _race_ at one point, injecting DNA from all the other species of the universe into the High Breed.
    -   It should be noted that interbreeding is primarily a human-on-alien thing, not an alien-on-alien thing. Apparently, it's one of humanity's greatest assets that it can take the best traits of other species and add them to its own gene pool.
    -   The Plumber Kids finally get an explanation in _Omniverse_: Turns out that they were actually genetic experiments of humans having alien DNA spliced into them, thanks to Kevin's Human/Osmosian hybrid DNA (Osmosian being a sub-species of humanity). Kevin's absorption powers in the DNA allowed the Rooters (Plumber black ops) to hybridize themselves with aliens and the Plumber Kids were experiments, whom after their plan was a failure, Servantis, the leader, rewrote their memories.
-   _CatDog_ comes close: A male frog and a sasquatch are the protagonists' parents... by adoption.
-   In _Celebrity Deathmatch_, the Loch Ness Monster falls in love with Fran Drescher because, apparently, he thought her laughter was a mating call. Later on the same episode, it's hinted that she had no problem in returning Nessie's affections...
-   Gandhi's raisin trip on _Clone High_:
    
    **Geldhemoor:** I am a hunkeycorn — half hummingbird, half donkey, half unicorn.  
    **Gandhi:** A hummingbird and a donkey doing it? I hope your mom wasn't the hummingbird.
    
    -   Not to mention that Geldhemoor later offered to lay Gandhi. Thrice.
-   Discussed in _Disenchantment_ several times, when Elfo, an elf who is about three feet tall, gets into a Fake Relationship with a curvy, twelve-foot giantess.
    
    **Bean:** Come on, Dad. You can't stand in the way of true love. He's an elf; she's a giant. It must be so hard for them already. _(lowers voice)_ I mean, think about it.  
    **Zog:** _(grunts, shakes head)_ I never want to think that thought again.
    
    -   It turns out Elfo himself is the son of a male elf and a female ogre.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   In "Screwed the Pooch", Carter thought Brian knocked up his prized greyhound. When the puppies were born, they looked amazingly like Ted Turner...
    -   Brian did father a perfectly normal human child with Tracy.
    -   One of the show's famous Cutaway Gags took place on Noah's Ark and, due to the lack of specific guidelines on mating, an elephant and a penguin managed to make offspring. Noah is none too pleased.
    -   "Into Harmony's Way" featured a parody of _Muppet Babies (1984)_, but rather it being about the Muppets as babies, it is about babies of the Muppets, showing Kermit and Miss Piggy's son "Kermie Jr.", a disgusting half-frog half-pig hybrid begging to be killed.
    -   "Stewie Is Enceinte" has Stweie impregnate himself with Brian's DNA and give birth to a litter of deformed human-dog hybrid babies.
-   In _Futurama_, anything which qualifies as a robot can apparently date another robot. This leads to Bender having a brief love affair with _the ship_.
    
    **Bender:** In order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400 ton booty.
    
    -   There have also been human/robot (and robot/head) relationships, despite it being taboo.
    -   In the third episode Amy tries to set Leela up with an energy being. She is later seen leaving with it herself.
    -   Kiff also ends up pregnant to Amy and Leela, despite not only being alien but also technically androgynous.
    -   Then there's Yivo, who can mate with everything (at once).
-   _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_ gives us the union of Irwin's parents, the father being a Dhampyr (though this was only revealed even later, he appears entirely human), the mother being a several-millenia-old mummy. Irwin's dad even says having a son is "leaving a whole lot of questions that don't need to be answered".
-   In _Harley Quinn (2019)_, Doctor Psycho, who has dwarfism, was formerly married to Giganta and has a son with her.
    
    **Poison Ivy:** Quick sidebar — how did _this_ work, sexually?  
    **Doctor Psycho:** _\[easily storming inside between Giganta's feet\]_ Not great!
    
-   One episode of _Kaeloo_ had Kaeloo, a frog, and Mr. Cat, a cat, decide to see if they can have a baby. Subverted since they decide not to have one, though Quack Quack has an Imagine Spot showing the viewers what would've probably happened: orange, whiskered tadpoles.
-   In the _Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"_ episode "Altruists" Stimpy puts on a female duck costume to make the guard duck fall in love with him, when they start making out Stimpy lays eggs with contain half cat and half duck creatures.
-   The _Rick and Morty_ episode "Vindicators 3: The Return of World Ender" has a failed attempt at this when Vindicators Supernova (a Starfire parody who's the physical embodiment of a dying star) and 1-Million Ants (a sentient ant colony in a vaguely humanoid shape) had an affair that managed to result in a pregnancy, only for said offspring to die in the womb due to being "Half collapsing star and half ant colony". The _Vindicators 2_ mini-series also showed that the miscarriage itself resulted in a massive explosion that destroyed a planet.
-   Hot turtle-on-cat action in _Rocko's Modern Life_. And one of their offspring was a steer because a steer friend helped hatch the singular egg, so one presumably took after him. Don't worry about it too much.
-   The Daughters of Aku in _Samurai Jack_. Originally assumed to be simply a title of seven sisters raised by an evil cult as assassins, this was eventually revealed to be _literally true_; while it _is_ plausible for Aku to shapeshift into a human, their conception was anything but ordinary. (Aku was summoned by the cult, and out of amusement, he donated some of his dark essence by spilling it into a goblet. Much to his surprise, the high priestess _drank it_, and her seven daughters were conceived as a result.)
-   In _The Simpsons_ episode "Simpsons Tall Tales", Homer-as-Paul Bunyan falls in love with the normal-sized Marge and eventually asks her when they might be able to have sex. Marge tells Bunyan!Homer that she needs to take a few more yoga classes.
-   An early episode of _South Park_ about genetic engineering is titled "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig", and one of the scenes shows exactly that. Double example: the pig later had children, but the father was actually Mr. Garrison.
-   In an episode of _Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends_, a frost giantess falls in love with Iceman and tries to make him marry her. She doesn't see anything unusual about this, but he's terrified.
    
    **Iceman:** I can't marry you! You'll probably step on me!
    
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_:
    -   Parodied in "Rock-A-Bye-Bivalve", a passerby notices SpongeBob and Patrick walking a baby scallop together, and tries to make sense of the apparent inter-species relationship.
    -   And of course, the never-to-be-answered question of how Mr. Krabs (a crab) ended up with his daughter Pearl (a _sperm whale_), especially since he doesn't even seem to be married.
-   _Squidbillies_:
    -   In the Pilot Episode, Early Cuyler had romances with his morbidly obese human lover, Krystal, and while he was in prison, she was pregnant with Rusty, who, shortly after his birth, was abandoned in an empty chicken bucket to be raised by Early's sister Lil. 15 years later, Rusty finds Early working on a chain gang and they reunite.
    -   And years later from that, half-land squid, half-human Rusty and his all human girlfriend Tammi have an apparently all human child that she names Macho-man Randy Cuyler.
-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_:
    -   Tom's father Dave is a normal man, presumably from Mewni. Meanwhile, his mother Wrathmelior is a Kaiju\-sized Big Red Devil.
    -   Subverted with Eclipsa and Globgor: the latter is even bigger than Wrathmelior, but we later see that he's a Sizeshifter.
-   _Steven Universe_ is the son of a male human and a living gemstone alien. While she is about eight feet tall, in this case the weirder question is how they managed to conceive when her body is actually made of Hard Light. However this works, she had to give up her physical form in order to give birth to him, and in the process passed on the gem that serves as her Heart Drive.
-   _The Wuzzles_ were cartoon characters that were hybrids of two species. They included Bumblelion (bumblebee/lion), Hoppopotamus (rabbit/hippo), and Eleroo (elephant/kangaroo).
    -   Lampshaded on _Robot Chicken_ with a flashback of a lion having sex with a bee (_somehow_), shown just to illustrate the point.
-   _Young Justice (2010)_ features a romance and eventual marriage between Superboy (a Kryptonian clone) and Miss Martian, whose real form looks like this. M'gann being a Voluntary Shapeshifter, we can probably assume she only ever got passionate with Conner in her humanoid Green-Skinned Space Babe form (especially given how ashamed she is of her true form and hides it constantly) despite Conner accepting her hideous White Martian form with no sign of disgust.
