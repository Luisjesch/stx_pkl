The Ball of Light Transformation is a peculiar form of Voluntary Shapeshifting, where a character becomes not another creature but a flying orb, mote, speck, flame or tiny star made of light. Size, color and brightness can vary.

Such a form is often invulnerable, light being intangible, or at the very least very hard to hit thanks to its small size and mobility. Some can even goes through walls, or slip through tiny spaces. Although many will just use this form as an alternate means of Flight.

This is a power commonly associated with fairies and similar creatures. Can be a variant of Elemental Shapeshifter, with light or Pure Energy substituted to other elements.

Contrasting with this transformation as a standard power, it can also be a one-time event when a character is metamorphosed, resurrected, ascended to a higher plane of existence or other life-changing event.

The popularity of this trope in film or live-action TV can be linked to it being a very easy special effect.

Compare with Energy Beings, Spark Fairy and Will-o'-the-Wisp, for things that have this shape permanently.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Mikujin, the Robot Buddy sidekick from _Doraemon: Nobita's Dorabian Nights_ has the ability to turn himself into a fiery orb of fire at will. Earlier on Mikujin (who seemingly ditched Doraemon and gang) comes back and rescues the heroes when their sleeping pods are flung into a storm by the villains, and Suneo said they were rescued by a ball of flames, which everyone scoffed at and said he's dreaming. That ball of flames turns out to be none other than Mikujin, much later in the story.
-   _Eto Rangers_: The Jyarei Monsters, the Jyarei Elite and even Jyarei Queen Nyanma herself are all capable of turning into balls of light. For the Monsters and the Elite, they do this to invade the Novel Worlds; in Nyanma's case, she uses it when she goes to Mugen on certain occasions.
-   The first season finale of _Hell Girl_ sees this used as an alternate form of flight. Ai becomes a ball of purple light when escaping the spider so that she can take her revenge on Hajime and Tsugumi in the world of the living. Her minions do the same, albeit in colors corresponding to their straw doll forms, to follow her in hopes of talking her down.
-   _Natsume's Book of Friends_: When the gods Fuzuki and Houzuki decide to leave Mount Misumi, they and their followers transform into balls of light to depart from the mountain.

    Comic Books 

-   _Mélusine_: Fairies like Mélisande can turn into a small ball of light. Mélisande mostly uses it when needing to fly faster than with her fairy wings. Notably, on her first appearance in the comic, Mélusine confuses her for a firefly and catches her in a glass jar. Also of note, when Mélisande uses it to sneak into Mister Haaselblatt's office after being egged on by the other witch's school students.
-   _Spider-Man_: Will O' the Wisp can fly by making himself lighter than air and expelling a trail of excess molecules behind him. He gives off so much light when he does this that he looks like an ethereal glowing sphere.

    Films — Animation 

-   In the _Disney Fairies_ movies, Clarion the Queen Fairy often shows up first as a trio of floating lights that then coalesces into her physical form.
-   _DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp_: Unlike other genies who would rather turn into smoke, the genie in this movie (and anybody he brings inside the lamp with him) becomes a small cloud of sparks or a mote of light to enter/exit the lamp.
-   The Blue Fairy from _Pinocchio_ first appears as a bright light that looks like a star before taking the form of a beautiful woman. Then she departs in the same way.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader_ has Lilliandil, Ramandu's daughter, falling from the sky as a blue star before taking human form. Then she rises up again in the same shape. It's implied, though, that the star is her true form and that she could take any she wish.
    
    **Lilliandil:** If \[my beauty\] is a distraction, I can change form.
    
-   Helena Ravenclaw, being a ghost, has this power in the second part of the film adaptation of the seventh book of the _Harry Potter_ series, _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_.

    Literature 

-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_: The espers are depicted as turning into balls of red light when in Closed Space.
-   This is the true form of the Terrestrials in Eric Frank Russell's "Metamorphosite". The apparent captives turn into blindingly bright light at the end of the story — their humanoid appearance was simply A Form You Are Comfortable With.
-   _The Stormlight Archive_: This is the power of the _nex-im_ brand of Fused. The Fused spirit can eject from its body as a ribbon of reddish light, leaving behind a hollow husk of carapace. The Fused then flies with extreme speed in its ribbon form before recreating its body at the destination point. The only way to kill a Fused of this brand (inasmuch as you can ever kill a Fused, anyway) is to either kill it so quickly that it has no chance to eject, or to bait it into using four bodies in a row to fight you instead of retreating to replenish its Voidlight on the fourth jump.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Babylon 5_. "The Deconstruction of Falling Stars" has a being who's watching the events of the episode do this to reveal that he's in the future, and that humanity has evolved into Energy Beings much like the Vorlons before them.
-   In _Charmed_ this is an ability of the Whitelighters, called orbing, and their primary means of transportation. Although the "ball" shape is probably based on episode budget, because it isn't used every time. Their transformation looks more like _Star Trek_ teleportation.
-   Kamen Rider Meteor from _Kamen Rider Fourze_ transforms by being enveloped in a Sphere of Power that flies away, performing a Dynamic Entry upon landing as an explosion of energy and revealing his Rider form once it has faded.
-   _Merlin_:
    -   The Sidhe, which in this series are small blue-skinned fairies, often appears as small, blue balls of light flying around.
    -   In the episode "Goblin's Gold", the title goblin can turn into a mote of light. He uses it to escape pursuit and fly through walls, but also to enter a human's body and attempt possession, successfully with Gaius.
-   In the Series Fauxnale for _Mystery Science Theater 3000_, as the Satellite of Love crew approaches the edge of the universe, they become balls of light corresponding to the main colors of the characters (Mike=Blue, Crow=Yellow, Servo=Red, Cambot=White, Gypsy=Purple). Of course, when the series was Uncancelled, they reverted back to their regular forms.

-   The hero of _Space Sheriff Gavan_ starts using an energy form to fly and fight enemies as the series goes on. He once meets an opponent with a similar power, San Dorva; when he turns into a ball of light, Gavan responds in kind and they tussle for a while in the air as red and blue balls of light, respectively.
-   In _Stargate SG-1_ and the rest of the Stargate-verse, people who Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence take the form not of a ball of light, but of a luminous blob with waving tendrils. Ascended Ancients can then take this form at will, but they're pretty much Energy Beings all the time by this point — though they can also resume a material form if they wish.
-   This is the true form of the Organians in the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Errand of Mercy". The amiable old men turn into blindingly bright light at the end of the episode — their humanoid appearance was simply A Form You Are Comfortable With.
-   The various Ultras from the _Ultra Series_ have demonstrated abilities to transform themselves into balls of energy for interstellar travel. The pilot of _Ultraman_ in fact has Ultraman in the form of a glowing red orb pursuing the space monster, Bemular, in the form of a blue orb, both of them who ends up crashing in the mountains of Japan.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Caribbean legends speak of a kind of evil hag known in different parts as soucoyant, loogaroo, asema, or Ole-Higue. Whatever the name, she appears as an old woman by day, but by night transforms into a ball of ghostly fire (leaving her skin behind) and flies off to suck the blood from people. The way to destroy her is to find the discarded skin and salt it; depending on the legend, she then either becomes poisoned by the salt when she puts the skin back on, or is unable to put it on at all and perishes without it.

    Tabletop Games

-   _Shantae: Half-Genie Hero_: Hypno Baron's Castle has Cute Ghost Girl Ikki who's invulnerable to damage when using her ball-of-light form to travel around the room and not attacking, having to detransform to attack.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Champions of Far'aus_, Monstrovs with Light, Arcane, or Shadow power sets, as opposed to ones without them, get a third form in addition to their humanoid and monster forms, referred to as "amorphous" forms, that are more-or-less ball-shaped forms made of the respective magic type. The amorphous form No-Sells non-magic and non-elemental based attacks, and can fly in the air, and through most objects, giving Monstrovs without air or lighting power sets the ability to fly, but the form actively drains their energy.
-   In _Super Temps_, superhero High Voltage (which, as is easy to guess from his name, has electric powers) can use a "travel form" to fly, which is a ball of energy surrounded by lightning bolts.
-   _XRS_: When flying at speeds above mach 3 the XRS is engulfed in radiation, becoming a being made of pure energy.
