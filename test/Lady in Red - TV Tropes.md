_"Red. Red. RED. **RED**, Charlie boy. Red is the color of sex! Burgundy is the color of hot water bottles! Red is the color of **sex** and **fear** and **danger** and signs that say, '**Do. Not. Enter.**'"_

Lady in Red is something of an old-fashioned trope, where The Vamp or the Femme Fatale was designated by having her wear bright red formal wear. A Lady in Red is sexy. The Lady in Red wasn't necessarily a slut, but she was strongly sexual, and often had a strong personality. In more prudish times the Lady in Red was considered almost dangerous. Red clothing is also associated with prostitutes, chorus girls and other dancers, and other women attempting to be sexy.

_This trope is about the character type, not the dress itself._ A character wearing a red outfit does not always make her a Lady in Red. For example, according to Chinese mythology, a woman who dies in a red dress, or commits suicide in one, is able to come back to haunt those who wronged her, which leads to a multitude of ladies in red dresses in Hong Kong horror movies. These ladies are not necessarily a Lady In Red. Additionally, in Bollywood and throughout Southeast Asia, red is more associated with marriage and love than with sex. Thus, a woman in a red sari is almost never a Lady In Red. The basis of this trope comes mostly from Western culture.

This trope is for grown women only; for little girls, see Little Dead Riding Hood and compare Princesses Prefer Pink.

Compare Little Black Dress, Pink Means Feminine, Pink Is Erotic. Contrast with Virgin in a White Dress, Widow's Weeds, and Red Hot Masculinity. The Glamorous Wartime Singer is often a Lady In Red, as is The Chanteuse; sometimes, the dress will be a Happy Holidays Dress or Sexy Santa Dress.

Not to Be Confused with _The Woman in Red_, though Kelly LeBrock certainly wears one in the film and all promotional materials.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Black Butler_ has Madame Red (her real name is Angelina Dalles-Barnett but it's a nickname she earned due to her red hair), Ciel's aunt. She's a free-spirited young widow who likes to have fun and is flirty with everyone she meets. She wears red because it's the color of blood: she is Jack the Ripper.
-   Erica Blandelli of _Campione!_ is a quite beautiful Magic Knight Lady of War, often seen wearing an elegant red dress (she's even known as "Diavolo Rosso", which means "Red Devil" in Italian). She's very passionate and forward about her feelings for Godou Kusanagi, making her a rare heroic example of a Femme Fatale.
-   _Madlax_ wears a crimson red cocktail dress in the first episodes into battle. And even the man she's about to kill admits she looks gorgeous.
-   Kaolinite from _Sailor Moon_. Interestingly, she changes to black after her apparent death and resurrection.
-   _One Piece_: In her introductory arc, Boa Hancock wore a revealing red blouse that showed much of her chest and a loose sarong that exposed her long, slender legs.
-   Yumi Komagata from _Rurouni Kenshin_. Notably, she used to be an oiran before joining up with Shishio.
-   _Ranma ½_: Played for laughs with Ranma Saotome's girl form. She's one of the most (if not _the_ most) attractive women in the entire series. She knows it and plays it up for all the benefits she can possibly get, especially in the manga. Ranma's seductive ways are highlighted by her typical red shirt, her red hair in the anime, and, at one point, a red Qipao dress from some official art. Plus, in general, she's just seen in a lot of red clothing.
-   _Phantom Quest Corp._: Ayaka Kisaragi is stunning for a woman her age and is the series' resident fanservice character. Each episode opens with her wearing a form-fitting red dress (also featured on the cover art), which has a low-cut back and a split seam to show off her legs, along with a matching pair of high-heels. It gives her the look of a lounge singer,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  but she's actually an Occult Detective.
-   Ran of _Ryu the Cave Boy_ is a dark-skinned woman who wears a red dress and no shoes, alongside a pretty red flower in her hair.
-   _Revolutionary Girl Utena_:
    -   In the anime version of _Revolutionary Girl Utena_, Anthy wears a red dress during the Rose Duels as she's the bride and the prize of the tournament. The sexual and dangerous connotations become more and more apparent as the show goes on as it's realized that she's sleeping with her brother, serves as his Dragon and seduces and tempts various other characters (often at Akio's behest)
    -   Touga and Akio are a Rare Male Example. Touga is associated with red roses, has red hair and his outfit is lined with red. Akio wears red and drives a red sports car. They're both a bit slutty, serve as the main Mr. Fanservices and use sex and love to manipulate and charm everyone around them.
-   _Zombie Land Saga_: Yugiri's association with red and the adult nature of her work as an oiran evoke this trope. Though she subverts the moral ambiguity of the classic Lady in Red, instead being a kind and heroic figure. Her red dress while performing "Saga Jihen" evokes the image even further, as the song itself is written as a tragic song of romantic yearning.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batwoman_: Kate Kane in her first appearance in the DCU series _52_. She's described as having "the kind of beauty that leaves you _breathless_," while wearing a brilliantly red dress.
-   _Crimson_: The series had two prominent ladies in red: the resident monster hunter Scarlet Thinbaut X, who wore an all-red sexy combat suit evocative of _Little Red Riding Hood_ and the Big Bad Lisseth, dressing in a long-red gown sporting some Navel-Deep Neckline. While both characters qualify as Ms. Fanservice, they fit the trope in different ways with Lisseth being openly seductive, while Scarlet serves as The Hero's Love Interest. Scarlet's ancestor Marraine also used to be one, wearing a red cape that marked her as off-limits to any lower louts and available only to noblemen.
-   _Daredevil_: Elektra wears a red Leotard of Power and is as known as a devilish temptress as she is for her deadly fighting skills.
-   _Lady Death_: Satasha wears a red Stripperiffic outfit and is a Lipstick Lesbian. Her friend Wargoth harbors feelings for her despite being aware of her orientation.
-   _The Mighty Thor_: When Thor was first dating Jane, Odin did not approve of his son dating a mortal, so he sent Amora the Enchantress to seduce him and break them up. Amora chose the best vamp outfit she could: a red slinky dress complimented with a white mink coat.
-   _Raptors_: Camilla Molina wears a bright-red fetishistic bondage gear with a red coat, as befitting a sexy vampire temptress like her. At the end of the series, Vicky Lenore takes up her mantle by wearing the same outfit and continuing Camilla's mission.
-   _Sin City_: The title character in "The Babe Who Wore Red" is a beautiful Damsel in Distress whose striking red dress is the only object of color in the otherwise black-and-white noir story. She turns out to be a subversion of the trope, as she's actually a nun who considered forsaking her vows.
-   _Vampirella_: Vampirella is a female vampire who wears a red sling-bikini and whose seductiveness is her trademark.
-   _Wonder Woman_: In _The Legend of Wonder Woman (2016)_, Etta spends months trying to get Diana "Prince" to wear something that flatters her, and when she finally manages it at a dance Diana is in a floor-length sparkling red dress that clings to her curves and leaves Steve Trevor momentarily speechless.

    Fan Works

-   _Once More with Feeling_: Asuka wears a very "adult" red dress to the school dance, one that takes Shinji's breath away.
-   _Rampage of the Rail Bandits_: Bonnie purposely invokes this to get the trucks to do her will.

    Film — Animated 

-   _Aladdin_: When Jafar takes over, he puts Jasmine in a skimpy red harem dress, for obvious reasons. She is still wearing it when she tries to seduce him.
-   Esmeralda wears a red pole-dancing outfit in "Topsy Turvy" in _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_. Ironically, in Real Life, red is considered bad luck for the Romani, and Judge Frollo was watching her dance in public... Bad luck indeed.
-   In _The Swan Princess_, the imposter Odette's dress was slinky red and black, as opposed to Odette's usual virginal white.
-   Subverted, then the subversion is lampshaded by Jessica Rabbit from _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_. She's gorgeous and wears a very revealing long slinky shiny dress, showing some legs and lots of cleavage, but she is a Nice Girl through and through.
    
    **Jessica:** I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.

-   Downplayed in _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1_.

    Literature

Nina, whose favorite color is red and to whom the color is most associated, is also sensual, really knows how to enjoy the finer things in life, and is "built like the figurehead of a ship carved by a generous hand". She also works in a brothel and could be considered a Femme Fatale (literally, if you take into account her Grisha abilities).
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: Cersei doesn't always wear red, but she wears it enough that it's noticeable. Justified, because it's her family color. And Melisandre, who _always_ wears red. Also justified: she wears red for religious reasons.

    -   In "Surprise", Drusilla wears red in contrast to the virginal Buffy, Drusilla having already been 'corrupted' by Angel like Buffy soon will be.

    -   In "Wild at Heart", sultry nightclub singer Veruca makes love to the microphone while wearing a red blouse and red lipstick, all the while locking eyes with Oz. Willow is not happy; quite rightly as it turns out, as Oz cheats on her with Veruca later in the episode.

-   _Doctor Who_: "The Next Doctor" has Miss Hartigan, who wears a bright red dress while crashing a funeral and responds to a cleric's criticism with "Is it too exciting?" Given the time period, such bright outfits were commonly worn by prostitutes to attract the attention of potential clients, hence their outrage when she should be wearing something more somber.
-   _Firefly_: Inara Serra is a classy companion, which is something between a therapist, geisha, and courtesan. Captain Mal Reynolds would describe her profession as whoring. She wore such a dress at the beginning of "Shindig". It is bright red and in two pieces, conveniently showing Inara's midriff. The skirt part is very long and rather slinky and tight.

She next appears at the constabulary's New Year's gala ball in an off-the-shoulder red dress with a beaded fringe, together with a red feathered hair ornament. After telling William about her decision to become a psychiatrist, he expresses doubt that she came there to tell him that, and she blurts out that she and Darcy have separated. Moments later, they're kissing, framed in a doorway with fireworks exploding in the sky around them.
-   _The Nanny_: The opening theme lampshades that Fran is Lady in Red: "She's the lady in red while everybody else is wearing tan". In the pilot episode, she comes down the stairs to a party wearing a red dress while the piano player sings "The Lady in Red".
-   _Red Dwarf_:
    -   Kochanski is Dave Lister's Love Interest and, most would agree, out of his league. In season 7, Kochanski's default outfit is a tight red shiny uniform that screams "sexy lady". In one episode, Lister gives Kochanski a beautiful red sparkly dress as a present, but she wears it only in Kryten's Imagine Spot where he imagined Lister and Kochanski as a couple who sent him away.
    -   Princess Bonjella, rescued by Ace Rimmer from Space Nazis in "Stoke Me a Clipper", wears a long tight red dress. There'll be time for explanations later. And hopefully, some sex...

She's shown to be seductive and sexually enticing by the way the lead singer is enamored with her, and the way she seems to playfully toy with him throughout the video.

    -   Muffy from _Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life_ is an expy of Eve. She's the local bartender. She's the most flirtatious bachelorette. If you marry her in the Updated Re-release version she will trade her skimpy red-and-black dress for a more conservative baby blue one.
