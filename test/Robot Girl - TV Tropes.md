Body of titanium, heart of gold.

**Charley:** You know, little girl, you freak me the hell out. On the outside, you're just pretty as a picture, but on the inside, you're a...  
**Cameron:** Hyperalloy combat chassis.  
**Charley:** ...is that a complicated way of saying "scary robot"?

She's gorgeous, she's sexy, and she's got a 50,000-mile warranty. She's the Robot Girl, a staple character archetype in anime. Most commonly found in science fiction and Sentai stories, but not exclusively. Despite their artificial nature, Robot Girls are never — well, hardly ever — sexless; they are at the very least cute as hell, and more often drop-dead gorgeous, if not outright seductresses. Robot Boys are not unheard of, but they usually take on more robotic characteristics than Robot Girls do. Despite how cute or sexy she may be, though, the Robot Girl is often a dangerous opponent in a fight, even if they're only created to do common household chores.

Common characteristics of a Robot Girl are their artificial human-like skin that covers their inner frame as opposed to metal or plastic plating (such as the Fembot), a beautiful and fully articulated face, synthetic hair and other organic characteristics that makes them appear and feel more human than any other types of humanoid robots. Think the _Terminator_ but as a cute girl. (Which has been done already.)

Sometimes the character is shown to be an android by some unusual accessory to cue the audience. Due to the popularity of _To Heart_'s Multi, having headphone cups, air vents or antennae for ears is almost universally understood. Other times, like Aigis (pictured at right), visible mechanical joints are another dead giveaway.

However much the robot girl trope slides closer from either end of the anthropomorphism scale, their human face and hair will almost always be the last thing to be roboticized by any character designer aiming to invoke this trope. Their arms or legs may even be fully robotic but their human torso will almost likely be preserved in the design. Often opting for a skin-tight hi-tech looking jumpsuit to emphasize their feminine features such as many of the female robots of the _Mega Man_ franchise and its many offshoots.

The robot girl is not necessarily always depicted as a mechanical being. The character type can also encompass cyborgs, Artificial Humans, Artificial Intelligences and Virtual Ghosts with female on-screen or holographic avatars.

While not unheard of in American shows (_My Living Doll_, _Small Wonder_, _Mann & Machine_) the robot girl on American TV tends to be a gimmick or MacGuffin on which to hang a series concept rather than a character type in its own right.

Of course, Japan being the worldwide leader in consumer electronics, androids are quite popular in that country. These androids could be male, but because Most Writers Are Male, most of them are sleek, sexy females. (Technically they would be gynoids, if one cares.)

_Very_ often an Innocent Fanservice Girl. After all, why in the world would a drop-dead gorgeous female facsimile have any conception of chastity, much less modesty, programming notwithstanding? If the Robot Girl is the lead female or at least an important one, this innocence and naivety can be a large part of their character or even the theme of the work.

Robot girls are often, but not always, depicted with a monotone emotionless personality to further emphasize that they're a robot and not an actual girl. Examples of this have included Cameron from _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_, Eve Edison from _Mann & Machine_ and Rhoda from _My Living Doll_. Unless, of course, the robots are programmed from the start to simulate - or even genuinely experience - emotion, such as the Cylons from _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_ or the Replicants from _Blade Runner_.

Compare Fembot (for when Robot Girls are more robot than girl), Projected Man (for when the Robot Girl is a hologram) and Robosexual (and Sexbot). A few may also be a Robotic Spouse. Contrast Uncanny Valley Girl and Spaceship Girl.

## Examples

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   Night, of _Absolute Boyfriend_ and _Zettai Kareshi_ (the live action drama of the anime/manga) is the Spear Counterpart of this trope, it being more obvious he's robotic in the Drama.
-   Sigel in _Ah! My Goddess_ started out as a mannequin advertising an antique shop. Skuld then added some features, including artificial intelligence and the signature Rocket Punch.
-   No. 30/Thirty Nanba from _A.I. Love You_ is a computer program brought to life.
-   Nuku-Nuku and Eimi from _All-Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku_.
-   The title character Maico from _Android Announcer Maico 2010_ (Image<small>◊</small>) is a Robot Girl. But whenever referred to as a robot, she insists, "I'm not a robot." She prefers to think of herself as an android (which is also wrong, the correct term would be Gynoid).
-   The Angels in _Angelic Layer_ are similar, though they're about a foot tall and controlled by their users. The _Angelic Layer_ manga is set in the same universe as _Chobits_ and states that Angels were forerunners to persocoms.
-   _The Animatrix_ has an absolutely heartbreaking, and horrific scene during The Second Renaissance sequence featuring one. During the anti-machine movement, a robot girl made to look human is smashed to bits by a group of men who rip away her clothes, synthetic skin, and hair until there's nothing but a metallic skeleton left. All while sobbing that she's "real."
-   Naomi Armitage and the other "Thirds" from _Armitage III_ are a partial subversion since they easily can and do pass as fully human, to the point that they can even reproduce with humans. The "seconds" from which they descended were intentionally designed to fit this trope, however.
-   Astro Girl/Uran from Osamu Tezuka's _Astro Boy_ franchise is the younger sister to the titular protagonist. In the 60s series, she was built by Professor Ochanomizu as a birthday gift to Astro. In later chapters/episodes, Ochanomizu creates robot parents for Astro with the introdution of Rin (Astro's robot mother) and Ethanol (Astro's robot father) so he won't feel lonely after Tenam neglects him.
-   Nei from _Avenger_ is one, or so she believes. She's actually the first human girl born on Mars - specifically outside of the colonies that have settled on the planet's surface. She's been acting like a ''Doll'' in order to avoid drawing attention to herself.
-   Alita/Gally from _Battle Angel Alita_.
-   The hIEs in _Beatless_.
-   R. Dorothy Waynewright in _The Big O_.
-   Sylvie, Anri and the other sexaroids from _Bubblegum Crisis_.
-   _Chobits_ has the Persocoms, of which the main character is one. While male persocoms are actually quite common, since the main human cast is male, the majority of persocom characters in the series are female.
-   In _Concrete Revolutio: Choujin Gensou_, the superhero Earth-chan is a satellite which transforms into a robot girl in order to aid people in distress.
-   The SISTERs in _Coyote Ragtime Show_.
-   _Cutey Honey_ in all of her incarnations except _Flash_, the magical girls version. Though she wasn't actually human _there_ either.
-   Princess Ixquic and Leina in _Cyborg 009_. The first was built by (apparently) aliens to be one of the guardians of a gold pyramid; the second was created by a Mad Scientist to become the Soul Jar of _Adolf Hitler_, of all people.
-   In _Da Capo_, the robotic clone of one of the girls is distinguished by a keyhole (for winding) in the back and occasionally spewing smoke. Of course, only the male lead learns that it's not the real girl.
-   Minatsu Amakase from _Da Capo II_.
-   Korone the Liladan from _Demon King Daimao_
-   One of the earliest (and youngest) robot girls is Arale from Akira Toriyama's _Doctor Slump_, who in physical appearance is only around 12 years old, despite being 18 by the end of the run. That few others realize this is the series' main Running Gag.
-   Kurika Kurinohana (a.k.a. Clicker) from _Dokkoida?!_.
-   Annapuna and Unipuma - the Puma Twins from the _Dominion Tank Police_ manga and anime series - were revealed, close to the end of the original manga, as androids - Ostensibly 'love dolls', although they take offense at this designation. In the second manga series, their android nature was on the table all the time, even becoming a plot point on at least two occasions. Interestingly, in the anime the issue was ignored completely, even as an implication.
-   _Doraemon_ have a one-shot gadget, a robotic girlfriend named Roboko which Doraemon produces after Nobita complains Shizuka doesn't care for him much. Everything went well initially, with Roboko beating the snot out of Suneo and Gian when they tried picking on Nobita, but then Roboko turns out to be a Clingy Jealous Girl who starts targeting Shizuka the moment she starts chatting with Nobita. Hilarity Ensues as usual.
-   Riruru from _Doraemon: Nobita and the Steel Troops_ is a robot designed to look like a young human girl to infiltrate earth, and guide her robotic superiors to facilitate an invasion. But after being damaged and salvaged by the heroes before getting saved by Doraemon and friends, and especially befriending Shizuka, Riruru ends up having a change of heart.
-   Android/Artificial Human#18 of _Dragon Ball Z_ is a more destructive take on the trope, as she (and her siblings, most notably her twin brother #17) was built specifically to cause destruction. In an alternate timeline, she manages to eradicate the most powerful fighters in the world with her brother until they are both destroyed by Future Badass Trunks, who came back from the main timeline after helping the main cast destroy another android, the Big Bad of the saga Cell (it's not as confusing as it sounds). In the main timeline however, they are able to be subdued (mostly through the appearance of the Trunks from the future altering the timelines and Cell's interference) and she survives to marry one of the main cast. She does actually have biological parts (so she's more of a cyborg than an android), so is capable of producing a daughter and becomes a mother... An extremely powerful mother, but a mother nonetheless.
-   _El-Hazard: The Magnificent World_ features Ifurita, a wind-up weapon of mass destruction in the form of a curvaceous cutie. Her appearance and attitude vary wildly between the OVA and TV universes; in the former she evolves from an emotionless killer to a borderline Artificial Human, while in the latter she wavers between brainless and outright loony.
-   Ropponmatsu #1 and Ropponmatsu #2 from _Excel♡Saga_. In the anime, they're two distinct entities, while in the manga, there is only one Ropponmatsu core switched between the two bodies.
    -   Iwata becomes one for a time when he gets cancer and his brain is put in the Ropponmatsu 1 body as a stopgap measure to keep him not dead. He's quite pleased because he's always liked Ropponmatsu 1, seeing as she's a tall, well-built adult woman, but he gets into an argument with actual Ropponmatsu in body number 2, who's always gotten on his nerves. Iwata gets ready to throw down...and falls over as Ropponmatsu mocks him because she always found body 1 to be clunky and unreliable, and reveals that her personality was different (read: nonexistant) in this body because all her processing power was taken up staying upright.
    -   He also ends up in 2's body for a short while, much to his extreme displeasure.
-   Drossel from _Fireball_, interesting in that she doesn't look even remotely human beyond her basic body shape, but has an unusually human (and bitchy) personality.
-   Nano-Nano Pudding from _Galaxy Angel Rune_ and the game it's adapted from, _Galaxy Angel II_, is a living nanomachine Lost Technology taking the form of a young girl with a tail.
-   Mechanical humans abounded in _Galaxy Express 999_ and its sequels thanks to various plots about humans abandoning their old flesh bodies for mechanical bodies as well as android characters. Some of the main female robot girls would be be Claire, Yuki, and Promethium.
-   More examples of robot girls who are also Humongous Mecha: KouRyu and AnRyu from _GaoGaiGar FINAL_.
-   Most of the fembots in _Ghost in the Shell_ count, as do female full-body cyborgs, including the lead character, Major Motoko Kusanagi — the difference being that the former are still AIs which aren't truly intelligent, while full-body cyborgs are humans who have had most or all organic parts of their bodies replaced with mechanical substitutes, up to and including most of their brain. The Tachikomas also share a lot of the tropes associated with the archetype, despite the fact that they have tanks for bodies.
-   In _GunBuster 2_, Nono is actually a Buster Machine. She is clearly stated to be gynoid (female android) even before that.
-   The protagonists in _Gunslinger Girl_ are brainwashed cyborgs.
-   In _Haruhi Suzumiya_, Yuki and the other Humanoid Interfaces arguably count, although Yuki has the good fortune of not getting picked for the maid job.
-   _Heaven's Lost Property_: All the Angeloids are subservient android girls with wings, built for specific purposes and completely devoted to following their master's orders.
-   _HuGtto! Pretty Cure_ has Ruru. She starts off as a villain, but joins the Cures and eventually becomes one partway through.
-   Pion of _Humanity Has Declined_. And Oyage is a Robot Boy. Though their true forms are deep space probes.
-   Odette from _Karakuri Odette_, though she gradually develops human-like emotional traits that further qualify for Ridiculously Human Robots instead. A more straight Robot Girl would be Asia from the same.
-   In _Key the Metal Idol_, titular character Key acts as a prototypical example of this trope: Key herself insists that she is a robot, and demonstrates very little emotional affect for much of the series, much to the concern of the characters who serve as her guardians. These characters are almost uniformly convinced that Key is not a robot but rather a deeply traumatized young woman who retreated into a robot persona, which they indulge as the only identity Key will respond with. Nevertheless, Key's past it intertwined with much mystery and phlebotinum-style weirdness, including mechanical automatons that hunt her, and scientists who are obsessed with her, so the truth of her nature remains somewhat in question until the end of the series: she is more or less what her friends believed her to be; a young individual who has survived prolonged human experimentation, the violent loss of her family, and other forms of trauma and has adopted the robotic persona as a coping mechanism. But while she may not be a robot, her actual identity is no less fantastical: she is instead a Psychic Child of almost Little Miss Almighty proportions. Her Quest for Identity takes the duration of the series, but in the end, she gets an at least somewhat happy ending and seems to be healing at last. Thus in the end, the story is a direct deconstruction and aversion of this trope.
-   June from _Kokoro Library_.
-   Angela from _Kurogane Communication_, later accompanied by the even more human-like Lilith and Alice.
-   Moe, a French-made bisque automaton-turned-Tsukumogami, from _Love Hina_ (anime only).
-   The Combat Cyborgs of _Lyrical Nanoha_. There's also the female Wolkenritter and the Unison Devices, who are basically programs with physical forms.
-   Aiko from _Magical Pokaan_.
-   Mahoro and Minawa from _Mahoromatic_. Partially subverted in the series by having Mahoro constantly on the lookout for "dirty thoughts" on the part of Suguru Not to mention confiscating his porn collection. Being innocent herself, this creates a paradox. This argument happens in the series' second season, where Mahoro and Suguru's grandfather arguing the point, with the grandfather winning. This convinces Mahoro that _she_ is perverted.
-   The Gamia sisters, Erika, Lorelei... from _Mazinger Z_ (and Minerva X in the _Shin Mazinger Zero_ manga). Possibly Marquis Yanus from _Great Mazinger_ is one as well, since the Mykene grafted their brains in robotic bodies to survive underground, but it is harder to say with her.
-   Tima from _Metropolis (2001)_.
-   In _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_, we have two examples — and surprisingly, neither is female (well, as far as can be proven). It is heavily suggested, if not stated outright that Tieria is not entirely, perhaps not at all, human. Then, during the series finale, Lichty of all people turns out to be at least part cybernetic. This still can't save him, sadly.
    -   The first season epilogue introduces Tieria's evil twin Regene, and the second season goes on to imply that they, Big Bad Ribbons Almark, and the rest of the "Innovators" are artificial constructs. _And_ we see the first clearly female-bodied example: Anew Returner.
    -   It's also possible that they are cyborgs; while at least two of them are quite clearly part of mass cloning projects (Bring being the pilot of a very large number of kamikaze MS at one point, and Ribbons himself walking into the room and killing Regene while his own corpse bleeds on the floor) they are clearly capable of inducing Innovator traits in ordinary humans like Louise (who also has a cybernetic left hand).
-   Sayuri, Brooke, Vivian and the other "dolls" who serve Professor Machinegal in _Moldiver_.
-   In _Mother Keeper_ Syal and Mother are both robot girls. Syal is a battle cyborg and Mother is simply a computer made to look like a little girl. Both look ridiculously human though Mother doesn't seem to speak.
-   Marie from _My Dear Marie_.
-   Miyu from _My Hi ME_ and _My-Otome_. _Definitely_ designed for combat and war.
-   Lila, is type of android called a Humaritt from the Ecchi action series _Najica Blitz Tactics_. She is tasked along with the main protagonist (Najica) to track down rogue Humaritts, which can be identified from behind by a 3 letter serial in the form of a tramp stamp.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_:
    -   Chachamaru. Evangeline also has a number of Robot Maids serving in her resort. And to fulfill the hotness part of the trope, part of her Mid-Season Upgrade was an improved synthetic skin that essentially makes her look like a normal girl with robot ears. Naturally, there was a scene of her taking a bath soon after said upgrade.
    -   In an...interesting variation on the idea, Haruna uses her artifact to create a full size robot body for Sayo to use. Of course, Sayo can't actually possess it, but instead possesses a small doll that sits inside the robot body and pilots it like a Humongous Mecha. Being an Otaku Haruna naturally built so many guns into the thing that it's wonder that it's able to move.
-   Nano from _Nichijou_ is a robot who appears to be a perfectly normal human girl—aside from that huge Wind-Up Key sticking out of her back. The eight-year-old Professor who created her also likes to modify her body with useless additions, just for the heck of it, and the Professor refuses to remove the darn key "because it's cute." This doesn't always make Nano too happy, since she so much wants to come across as an ordinary girl. She eventually learns to love the key as part of herself in the end.
-   Malfina from _Outlaw Star_ is a bioroid who was created to serve as navigator for the titular ship as well as to be the maiden of the Galactic Lei Line. This causes her a great deal of distress to begin with, but Gene eventually convinces her that her artificial nature doesn't make her less human.
-   "D" from _Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure_ is effectively a Robot Girl for most of the story.
-   Mea from _Popotan_, a robot maid who also guards the other girls (Ai, Mai, & Mii) on their journey through Time.
-   Flandre, Francesca, and Francette from _Princess Resurrection_.
-   Meika from _Punch Line_ looks like a little girl but is a twenty year old robot. Being a robot doesn't give her any advantages over humans besides being very smart.
-   In Queen's Blade Rebellion, the little elf Yuit creates Vante, a robot girl incapable of speech (beyond one sound), but apparently cognizant and emotionally aware.
-   Arguably subverted in _Real Drive_, where android Holon clarifies that she isn't a woman in any real sense, and has no sexual identity beyond superficial programming meant to make her appealing for male users, and that she could change to a male body at any time without losing any sense of her real identity as a sentient machine.
-   The _Rozen Maiden_ are arguably a fantasy-based example, as opposed to straight(ish) science fiction. Specifically, they're dolls. They do have a clockwork mechanism that requires them to be wound up to be able to live, walk, talk and the like, but they also need a roza mystica, which would roughly translate to a soul to the dolls, and there's a lot of things they can do that clockwork engineering can't accomplish alone.
-   The entire Female Gender including Lime, Cherry, Bloodberry, Tiger, Panther and Luchs (among many others) from _Saber Marionette J_.
-   Mecha-Rin-rin-chan, an android double of herself that Rin-rin from _Sister Princess_ builds as a future companion for her brother Wataru when all his sisters have grown up and moved on to their own lives.
-   Titular character of _SoltyRei_.
-   Kurumi, Saki, Karinka and about 50 others from _Steel Angel Kurumi_.
-   At the end of the Alicization arc of _Sword Art Online_, Alice becomes a robot girl in the real world when her Fluctlight is transplanted into an android body, making her the world's first truly Artificial Human.
-   The autoscorers of _Symphogear_, being alchemical machines with the forms and personalities of women. On a more abstract level, Shirabe has this trope as a personal motif. She’s not literally a robot, but her status as the cast’s Emotionless Girl combined with a techno leitmotif and the most mechanized arsenal of the main heroines<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  do a lot to give this impression.
-   There are many androids of both genders in _Time of Eve_. On the female side, there are cafe regulars Sammy, Akiko, and Rina.
-   In _Totsugeki Pappara-tai Totsugeki! Pappara-tai_, there was originally one, then three, then five, then eight, then was about to become seventeen in total through out the entire manga... (Also, Dr. Shooba. N. Einstain answered the excellent question of "Why do we make robot girl... and not robot guy?" in vol. 9.)
-   Ai in _Video Girl Ai_, though since she was created by a VCR, she's not technically a robot. The same goes for Len in the sequel manga, _Video Girl Len_.
-   The title characters of _Wings of Vendemiaire_ are Steampunk automata that look like teenage girls.
-   Alpha, Kokone, Maruko, and the other Alpha from _Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou_ (manga and OVA). Alpha also meets a robot boy. She asks him if there are others. He does not know, but he tells Alpha that male models are somehow weaker than female ones, which explains why the female-looking robots prevail.
-   Dolores from _Zone of the Enders: Dolores, i_ is very much a Robot Girl. Innocent, kind of ditzy, and occasionally clumsy. A scary combination in a 100-feet-tall almost-godlike Humongous Mecha.

    Comic Books 

-   _Aphrodite IX_, ''Aphrodite IV'' and ''Aphrodite V''.
-   Beautie of _Astro City_ is an adult-sized robot replica of a popular children's toy. She fights crime even as she wonders about her own enigmatic origins.
-   The independent comic _Geisha_ is about Jomi Sohodo, an android originally built as a sex slave, but who was instead taken in by a kind, decent man who raised her as a real person alongside his own children. She's a talented painter and wants to make a career of it, but prejudice against androids makes this difficult. She ends up joining her adoptive father's "family business..." as a professional bodyguard.
-   Bonnie of _Last Man Standing_ is one.
-   Marvel Comics has a few examples:
    -   Jocasta from _The Avengers_, created by the evil male robot Ultron to be his bride; and later, Alkhema, who had a similar origin. Neither of these relationships worked out. Later on, Ultron showed up in female form himself.
    -   The Fantastic Four's receptionist is a robot named Roberta. She has a human-shaped upper body, so she looks human sitting behind her desk, but below that she has wheels. In the strictly non-canon _Fin Fang Four_ comics, she's dating the hulking but gentle robot Elektro; it's very cute.
    -   The protagonists of the _Livewires_ miniseries include three lovely Robot Girls (sorry, Construct Girls), each one a different take on this trope, from the snarky Cute Bruiser to the nearly-human viewpoint character.
    -   _X-Men_:
        -   Detective-Inspector Karima Shapandar (a.k.a. Omega Sentinel) was an unwilling victim of the Sentinel program's brief foray into converting normal humans, but her love for her mutant boyfriend Neal Shaara (Thunderbird III) allowed her to overcome her programming. She even joined the X-Men and became a more dedicated member than he was... until the mutants declared themselves a separate nation and shut her out. When her Sentinel programming flared up again, she didn't have any support to help her fight it off, and ended up a villain.
        -   When the computer running the Danger Room achieved sentience, it self-identified as female and built a body to match, calling herself Danger.
        -   Minordomo, the overly excitable Perky Female Minion to Mojo's robotic manservant Majordomo. Tends to overheat and shut down from sheer exuberance, which manifests as a heart attack. Fortunately, she has a reset button.
-   DC Comics has a few examples:
    -   In _The Black Ring_, Lex Luthor has a robotic Lois Lane for a sidekick.
    -   Platinum, Copper, and Nameless from the _Metal Men_.
    -   Indigo from the relaunch of the _Outsiders_, who is also revealed to be a Brainiac from the future.
    -   In _Superboy and the Ravers_, the Horizon Event DJ is revealed to have been an android the entire time when she's destroyed and her inner mechanical workings are exposed. She never quite seemed human but given that Event Horizon is an extraterrestrial nightclub that exists in a pocket dimension that was never any reason to expect her to be a robot.
    -   The limited series _Superman: Metropolis_ involves alien nanotech causing the city itself to become self-aware. She falls in love with Jimmy Olsen. Of course.
    -   Another example involving Jimmy Olsen, from _Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen_, starts with him finding a maiden in a snowbank, apparently a young woman from Viking times who had been frozen for centuries. It turns out that "Helga" is actually a gynoid and that Jimmy's fan club are using it to make Lucy Lane jealous.
-   Lyla Lay from _Paperinik New Adventures_. Lots of characters drool over her in the series' run, and probably a fair amount of readers too. Did we mention she's also a duck?
-   Richie Rich's robot maid, Irona.
-   Guri from the _Shadows of the Empire_ Star Wars multimedia event, which included comics, as well as the follow-up _Shadows of the Empire: Evolution_ comics. Most sensors short of a full medical scan are fooled into thinking she's an ordinary human. Which is rather the point, since she's also an assassin droid.
-   _Sky Doll_ is named after wind-up gynoids designed and used mostly for men's convenience and pleasure. Sky Dolls are happy with being slaves and sex objects, actual women are oppressed and seem to have the rights of house furniture, and men as well as the religious government prefer things just the way they are.
-   In _Y: The Last Man_, expensive male _actroids_ are used for comfort/sexual purposes in Japan after the death of all the men. Self-proclaimed manga fan Yorick is quite delighted by this.

    Comic Strips 

-   Another, very early American twist: a 1943 continuity arc in the Mickey Mouse comic strip introduced Mimi, a sexy robot girl who wooed Mickey in a sci-fi scenario. In the story's climactic battle, Mimi was actually blown apart during a Heroic Sacrifice; interestingly, she was treated as dead and never reassembled, making this decidedly **not** a Robot Disney Death.

    Fan Works 

    Films — Animation 

-   The _Robot Carnival_ segment "Presence" features one built by a man trying to compensate for his distant relationship with his own family.
-   _Tekken: Blood Vengeance_: Alisa.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The "Mecha" Gigolo Jane that appeared briefly in _A.I.: Artificial Intelligence_.
-   Annalee Call from _Alien: Resurrection._ It is interesting how fast other characters forget that they used to think about her as a human when they find out, though supplementary material implies there is some pretty bad blood between autons and humans...
    
    Johner: "Can't believe I nearly fucked that thing."
    
    Vries: "Yeah, like you've never fucked a robot!"
    
-   The title character in _Alita: Battle Angel_ is a total replacement cyborg: a "very human brain" in a cyber body.
-   The Fembots (though these were not of the Fembot variety) from the _Austin Powers_ series, usually equipped with machine-gun jumblies.
-   Any of the female replicants from _Blade Runner_ fit this trope, mainly Rachael.
-   Invoked as part of the plot to rescue the children in _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang_. Trudy disguises herself as a Doll-on-a-Music-Box, a present for the villain ruler.
-   Since there's no separate male version of this trope (for now), the titular _D.A.R.Y.L._ (short for Data Analysing Robot Youth Lifeform) technically qualifies.
-   Kristy Swanson's character becomes a "sort of" one of these in _Deadly Friend_.
-   _Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine_: Goldfoot constructs human-appearing robo-gals who seduce weathy men into marrying them, and then steal their assets. In the sequel, _Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs_, he uses them to assassinate assigned targets.
-   Despite being a machine, Ava from _Ex Machina_ is very female and very attractive. Many of the scenes that highlight her sexiness simultaneously draw attention to her artificial nature. Caleb does ask Nathan why he didn't just design her as a sentient black box instead, but Nathan points out that supplying the robot with a gender identity gives it a reason to interact with the outside world (while it turns out he also wanted sexbots, giving her along with the others physical sensation for this too).
-   _Future World (2018)_: Ash is an android who's basicially indistinguishable from a human, made in the form of a beautiful young woman. Except for her slightly metallic-looking blue eyes, nothing really gives it away at first.
-   The eponymous _Galaxina_ from the 1980 sci-fi spoof, played by Dorothy Stratten, is a robotic crew-woman on a space cruiser.
-   In _Hot Bot_, the eponymous "Hot Bots" are all female Ridiculously Human Robots, that are simply played by human actresses.
-   _Inspector Gadget 2_ has Gadget Model 2 (G2 for short), a "female" android police officer who Inspector Gadget ends up falling in love with (despite the fact that he's just a cyborg.) Like the above mentioned _Hot Bot_, G2 is a Ridiculously Human Robot, as she can feel emotions and even cries at one point.
-   _I Love Maria_ is a 1988 Hong Kong science fiction film, in which a gang leader created a female armed robot named Pioneer II, which was modeled after his girlfriend's face, leading her to develop a strong hatred for the robot. Later on, the robot is sent to hunt down one of the gang's members (and as well as a researcher working for the police), who became dissatisfied with the direction the gang is headed, only for Pioneer II to malfunction and be reprogrammed (hilariously, he confuses the robot to be Maria, whom she was modeled). Pioneer II slowly begins to develop feelings for the human characters, and is later given a human disguise.
-   Kay-Em 14 from _Jason X_, whose creator Tsunaron is strongly implied to be in a sexual relationship with her. When Jason Voorhees comes aboard the ship, Tsunaron upgrades her with a combat suite that allows her to actually kill Jason, until he in turn gets upgraded into "Über Jason" and takes her head off. She still survives the film as a disembodied head, with Tsunaron promising to rebuild her body.
-   M3GAN is a robot programmed to protect Cady from both physical and emotional harm. The AN in M3GAN actually stands for "android."
-   The iconic Robot Maria from _Metropolis_. In the novel Rotwang, the scientist who creates her, says that it's far more likely for a man to create a woman than another man.
-   One of the segments in _Movie 43_ features an MP3 player that is the size and shape of a human woman. Not surprisingly, the user base ends up using it for "other purposes" besides listening to music... despite a cooler in the lower end.
-   _My Girlfriend Is A Cyborg_. In spite of the title and use of the word in the film, she's actually a robot.
-   Roberta from _Not Quite Human II_.
-   _The Perfect Woman_ is a 1949 British comedy (based on a play) about an inventor who creates a robot with an appearance based on his niece, and hires a young man to take it out on a date as a field test. The film is noted for its lingerie scenes, which are fairly risqué for its period.
-   _RoboGeisha_. It's all there in the title.
-   Valeria in _Robot Holocaust_.
-   In _Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes_, Miss Ivory is revealed to be a clockwork automaton built by Spring-Heeled Jack and also his lover.
-   _Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_: Dr. Totenkopf's lieutenant turns out to be one of these, to Sky Captain's surprise. She is an excellent fighter and dedicated to her work, serving as the de facto main villain since her creator has been Dead All Along.
-   _Space Sweepers_ has "Dorothy," an android with a powerful hydrogen bomb hidden inside her that's indistinguishable from a young human girl. Subverted in that "Dorothy" actually **is** a human girl whose real name is Kot-nim, and instead of a bomb she's the host to a colony of powerful nanomachines. The real robot girl in the movie is Bubs, who is more of a Tin-Can Robot with a masculine voice until she gets upgraded with lifelike skin grafts and the appearance of a pretty human woman.
-   Megagirl, from the Team StarKid musical _Starship_.
-   In the original film (and its remake) and the book version of _The Stepford Wives_, all of the women in Stepford have been replaced with obedient androids. This was kept in the 2004 remake. Some of the sequels to the original film changed this process to simply the women getting brainwashed.

-   _The Thief of Bagdad (1940)_ featured an automaton dancing girl, given by an Evil Chancellor to a sultan who liked mechanical toys. When he went to embrace the dancing girl robot, it stabbed him.
-   In _Toys_, Alsatia (Joan Cusack) is revealed to be a robot at the end of the movie.
-   _Vice (2015)_: The most prominent is Kelly, one of the main characters and an artificial who escapes from Vice's facilities. While appearing human, her insides are a mix of organic and mechanical parts.
-   _Virtuosity_: Sheila 3.2, Virtual reality sex doll, whose sole function is to deduce your psychosexual needs, and fulfill them: "Sheila 3.2 is collecting information from 136 aspects of your physiology. Your heart rate, pupil dilation, vocal intonation, syntax..." She was scheduled for download to a super strong regenerative body, capable of shape-shifting into the IA virtual avatar. Subverted because the _male_ IA SID is the one who ends up being downloaded.
-   Almost all of the women in _Westworld_ (and Roman World and Medieval World too).

    Jokes 

-   The standard sci-fi romance plot is: Boy Meets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Builds New Girl!

    Literature 

-   In the _Adam Link_ series, robot Adam eventually gets a robot wife, of course named Eve.
-   Sheen of the _Apprentice Adept_ series: A sentient robot designed to appeal to protagonist Stile's personal tastes without being blatant enough to make him suspicious that she was a robot. (He figures it out anyway.)
-   In _The Adventures of Stefón Rudel_, Stefón creates two of these out of android parts and names them Stefanie and Kiki. Luckily they do not also become part of his collection of girlfriends.
-   In _Alien in a Small Town,_ Indira discovers her boyfriend hasn't just dumped her, he dumped her for an android. To her way of thinking, the ethics of this depend entirely on whether or not "Kim" is sentient and whether she is free. If she's both, then dating a robot is kinky but not inherently objectionable. If she's not sentient, then he's dumped her for a _sex toy,_ which means he never wanted real love in the first place. If she's sentient but not free, then he's dumped her for a _slave that he owns._ It's strongly implied Kim is nonsentient (even if she is perfectly capable of passing a Turing Test), and he owns her like any other object. Indira does not take any of this well.
-   In the New Series Adventures of _Doctor Who_ the Tenth Doctor encounters a cute cyborg girl named Silver Sally, whose components run on steam. However it is revealed that she is actually a murderous pirate who murdered a poor girl and transplanted her own cyborg parts on top.
-   Charlie, from _Five Nights at Freddy's: The Silver Eyes_, _Five Nights at Freddy's: The Twisted Ones_ and _Five Nights at Freddy's: The Fourth Closet_, though her true nature isn't made apparent until the third book; she was the first child killed by William Afton, and her father created four different animatronic bodies for her soul to inhabit (it didn't work, but his love for Charlie and grief over her loss gave said animatronic bodies something resembling life and a soul). Elizabeth Afton/Circus Baby also counts as one; she even steals Charlie's fourth body and poses as her in the ending of the second novel.
-   The classic (1938) short story _Helen O'Loy_ by Lester del Rey. A medical student (Phil) and a mechanic (Dave) modify a household robot to have emotions. While Phil is away Dave activates Helen, who learns about love (from watching soap operas!) When Phil comes back home Dave has already fled from her affections, but changes his mind and marries her. On his death Helen requests that Phil shut her down and bury her with Dave. Phil does so, even though it's revealed that he'd fallen for Helen too.
-   _House of Robots_ has Brittney 13, a robot designed to experience "adolescent human emotions," which she does... all the time.
-   In _Neo Akihabara Meipouchou_, R. Sena is one in a line of mass-produced gynoids, designed to look identical, but with distinct personalities.
-   _The Mark of the Dragonfly_: Annaturns out to be a lifelike robot, who was herself unaware that she wasn't a human.
-   Deirdre in C. L. Moore's "No Woman Born" is technically a Cyborg, although only her brain is organic. At the end, it's implied that she may be slipping into Emotionless Girl territory, because Cybernetics Eat Your Soul.
-   Penny becomes one of these in _Please Don't Tell My Parents You Believe Her_, a human soul trapped in a robot body. Possibly also Polly Vinyl Chloride.
-   Olimpia from "The Sandman (1816)". Perfectly human in appearance, although a bit too precise in music and singing.
-   The protagonist in _Saturn's Children_, a novel by Charles Stross. A Robot Girl Sex Slave no less, in a universe where humans no longer exist.
-   _Space Academy_: Trish becomes one of these once she successfully acquires a Space Cadet Sally bioroid body (implied to be a sexbot). She immediately attempts to break it in with Vance, which causes him no end of consternation.
-   Guri, from the _Shadows of the Empire_ Star Wars multimedia event novel.
-   Galatea from the backstory of _Soon I Will Be Invincible_. A sentient robot who became a member of the Champions.
-   Automata in _Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle_, who resemble twelve-year-old girls with animal ears, and act as the managers of the Ruins. They must follow the orders of Xfer (a race of humans who built the Ruins and the Automata) and Lords (a ruling family whom the Xfer serve).
-   Maggie, the protagonist of _Virtual Girl_.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Rommie, from _Andromeda_. Not to be confused with her hologram and AI duplicates.
-   The female human model Cylons from _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_. In Six's case, they're even specifically designed to be sexy. Needless to say they succeed in this aim. As with most Robot Girls, they're also capable fighters. It's likely not a coincidence that Boomer is drop-dead beautiful either. And it works, given the lengths their lovers go to protect them. By the end of the series, it becomes clear that there is really nothing robotic about the biological Cylons at all, other than that they can talk to computers by sticking their hands in the sink.
-   The Fembots from the original _The Bionic Woman_ series.
-   April and the Buffybot made short appearances in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_.
-   The prequel series _Caprica_ has this as well in the form of the first Cylon, Zoe Graystone. However, she's also a major subversion, as she doesn't look like the human-model "skinjobs" but rather is the faux-consciousness of a 16-year-old school girl downloaded into the ultra-robotic-looking proto-"Centurion" Cylon. She does have an avatar version of herself, which looks completely human.
-   Colon (pron. "Cologne") from _Choujuu Sentai Liveman_ was an early example, although she was unambiguously mechanical at a glance. She was specifically built to serve as a base operator, but jumped into battle far too often for her own good.
-   Android from _Dark Matter (2015)_, who is also, in a way, a Spaceship Girl thanks to her uplink to Raza's systems.
-   Cyborg Shibolena from _Denji Sentai Megaranger_ was close or far from this. Beauty check, Busty Check, Panty Check.
-   _Don't Look Deeper_: Aisha is an android made to appear like a beautiful human woman, though she doesn't know this at first. She's so convincing other people are fooled too, not just her. Aisha's given away only when an injury shows her metallic innards.
-   _Get Smart_ - Octavia is a KAOS Femme Fatale agent who seduces information from CONTROL's #2 men. Hymie the robot is promoted to #2 as he would be immune to her charms - only she's a robot herself, and the two fall in robo-love.
-   _The Good Place_:
    -   Janet is walking, talking, infinitely more helpful version of intelligent personal assistant programs like Siri or Alexa (Eleanor even calls her "Busty Alexa" at one point), providing information about the afterlife to residents of the Good Place. However, she's neither a robot nor a girl; rather, "she" is a genderless interface for the celestial mainframe. The human characters repeatedly refer to her as one and/or the other, and Janet always has to correct them.
        
        **Janet:** Not a robot.(...) Not a girl.
        
    -   She also has an Evil Counterpart in the Bad Place in the form of Bad Janet, a blonde bimbo in a black leather jacket who goes out of her way to be unhelpful before going back to checking her phone.
-   _Kamen Rider Zero-One_ has plenty of examples, with the most prominent one is the secretary Izu.
-   The live-action TV movie version of _Kim Possible_ has Athena, created by Drakken to destroy Kim only to find herself actually becoming friends with her; she sacrifices herself to save Kim, but is rebuilt by the end of the film with help from Kim's parents. She even shows off her true nature to Kim before the final act.
-   The short-lived science fiction cop show _Mann & Machine_ featured Eve, a highly intelligent but emotionally childlike android.
-   _My Living Doll_, a 1963-64 sitcom, starred Julie Newmar as Rhoda, a secret government project to create a robot astronaut.
-   On _MythBusters_, during a demonstration of a lie detector test, Grant is asked whether he has ever thought of building a female robot. He is very embarrassed, but doesn't deny it.
-   _The Outer Limits_ loves its robots, and occasionally combines it with Tomato in the Mirror. It being an anthology, some episodes have it turn out better than others for robots and/or any humans who love them than others.
-   Tenaya 7 in _Power Rangers RPM_' is a rare villainous example. Also her counterpart in _Engine Sentai Go-onger_ Kegalesia, whose robotic identity is given away by the valves and pipes coming out of her otherwise human-like body.
    -   Much earlier than that there was Archerina of _Power Rangers Zeo_, although she was much more metallic than most other examples, lacking in synthetic skin or coloration.
        -   Archerina's Japanese counterpart, Princess Multiwa of _Chouriki Sentai Ohranger_.
-   E.R.I.C.A. from the _Sliders_ episode "State of the A.R.T."
-   Vicki from _Small Wonder_.
-   _Stargate SG-1_ features female human-form Replicators, including Carter, one designed specificially to look like Dr. Lieutenant-Colonel Samantha Carter.
    -   Harlan also replicated SG-1 as robots to help him maintain his underground facility. Harlan is also a robot, and a barmy one at that.
    -   Also, the gynoid who created the replicators in the first place. As toys.
-   The _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episodes "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" (Andrea), "Requiem for Methuselah" (Rayna Kapec) and "I, Mudd" (various female androids).
-   Lal, Data's "daughter" from the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "The Offspring".
-   Seven of Nine from _Star Trek: Voyager_ is an interesting case. As a former member of the Borg, she was born human and was assimilated at a young age. Even though her connection to the Borg was severed and her human appearance and organs reasserted themselves after most of her Borg parts were removed, she still had to relearn human emotion and retained a few cybernetic implants.
-   Invoked on _Target Women_ in response to a creepy skincare commercial that showed the same "clone woman" over and over as a lab subject.
    
    _New Olay Professional Pro X! A specialized team of dermatologists and Olay have designed Pro X to resignal your skin so it looks more like it did when you were younger._  
    "But can a robot lady learn... to love?"
    
-   Cameron from _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_. Counts also as Emotionless Girl. It is strongly hinted that Cameron was made to be attractive deliberately. Her appearance was based on a resistance fighter named Allison Young, who was implied to know future John Connor personally.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_:
    -   Alicia in "The Lonely" is left by a sympathetic space captain with a prisoner who's been sentenced to exile on an isolated asteroid.

-   Rachel from the _Weird Science_ episode "The Copper Top Girl."

    Manhwa 

-   Chevrolet from _3 Level Combination_.
-   All of the EA robots from _Metal Heart_.

    Music 

-   Abney Park's _Herr Drosselmeyer's Doll_ described a steampunk version of the Robot Girl.
-   A chrome-y one gets her Marilyn Monroe on on the cover of Aerosmith's 2001 album _Just Push Play_.
-   The music video for "All Is Full of Love" by Björk, probably the inspiration for SVEDKA\_GRL (See below under Real Life).
-   Charli XCX's "Femmebot" may or may not be from the point of view of a literal robot girl, with a ton of liberally-peppered and playful robot metaphors that at least invoke this trope.
    
    _Go fuck your prototype_  
    _I’m an upgrade of your stereotype_  
    _Don’t come with a guarantee_  
    _I’ll use you up like you’re my battery_  
    _I feel the sparks between us, electric shock_  
    _Hot-wired if you mess it up, I’ll self-destruct_
    
-   Da Yoopers also had an unrelated song with that title on their debut album.
-   "Yours Truly, 2095" by Electric Light Orchestra: "I met someone who looks a lot like you, she does the things you do, but she is an IBM."
-   Robot Noodle from Gorillaz is an example, premiering in Phase Three. Probably a deconstruction, too—it's completely unlike the real Noodle and it turns out Noodle is not, in fact, dead. On top of that, this robot girl is vapid, incredibly violent, subservient to her creator, and generally not at ALL like Noodle.
-   The focus of Kokoro (from either perspective) is on a Robot Girl seeking a heart.
-   "FTWWW" and "Mastas of Ravencroft" by Mad Gear & The Missile Kid imply sex with android girls.
-   R&B singer Janelle Monáe portrays an alien Robot Girl named Cindi Mayweather in _Metropolis_, a quadrilogy of Concept Albums about Cindi's struggles after she falls in love with a human.
-   The title character of the Voltaire song "The Mechanical Girl," created by a tinker who made her as a second daughter. When a king whose wife ran off on his steed seeks to take her for his new queen and take her away from her father, things go quite badly for his royal highness.
-   "Robot Girl" is the title of a song by Was (Not Was). Guess what it's about.

    Mythology 

-   In _The Iliad_, Hephaestus is served by automatons in many forms, one group being servant girls of living gold, making this one Older Than Feudalism.
-   The smith Ilmarinen makes himself a wife of gold in _The Kalevala_. However, he could not actually bring her to life and she remained hard and cold, so he ended up scrapping her.

    Pinball 

-   _Pin\*Bot_ features a couple of robot girls on the back plate and the Jet Bumpers.
    -   _Bride Of Pin\*Bot_ **is** one, though the game involves her becoming a real woman.
-   The T-X from _Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines_.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: Debatably, female-identifying Warforged in the _Eberron_ setting are a magitek version of this trope, though they don't have any physical female characteristics unless they deliberately adopt them.
    -   Someone also homebrewed Robot Girls as a playable race. In gameplay terms, they're vulnerable to abilities that specially target inanimate objects, but since they're a person's soul in an artificial body, they get a CON score.
-   _New Horizon_: The Wafans, three entire races of Wave Form Androids, come in both male and female flavors across the board.
-   _Transhuman Space_: This setting offers a huge range of "cybershell" bodies on which AI software can be installed. Some "Cyberdolls" are inevitably built to resemble attractive human women — sometimes for innocent reasons, and sometimes not.

    Roleplays 

-   In _Alchemical Solutions_, Taylor Hebert gets uploaded into a new synthetic body.

    Theatre 

-   In the ballet _Coppélia_ the mysterious girl Franz has fallen for is actually a mechanical robot built by Dr. Coppelius.

    Video Games 

-   Mei Fang from _Arcana Heart_.
-   Robogirl, the appropriately-named ally from _Billy vs. SNAKEMAN_. Subverted; her 'robot body' is actually a shell she wears due to a weakly-defined anxiety about 'real' people. You help her get over it in the Pizza Witch storyline, and she takes off her shell, revealing a real flesh-and-blood person.
-   In the DLC of _BioShock 2_ Minerva's Den gives us the failed Robotic Little Sisters.
-   Eve in _Blaster Master Zero_ is an android who helps out Jason on his quest to find Fred and beat back the mutants. Jason even develops feelings for her, despite her not being an actual human. by the 2nd and 3rd games, Eve gets infected by the mutants and her body changes to the point where she becomes an actual living organic lifeform.
-   _BlazBlue_ has several, most notably the Murakumo Units and Kusanagi.
-   Dominique in _The Bouncer_.
-   The Arma Machina glyph in _Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia_ transforms Shanoa into a female automaton (distinguished from the presumably-male enemies by copper-colored Robot Hair and a flared body to resemble a dress). She's completely impervious to harm in the form and can destroy Spikes of Doom on contact, but her movement is extremely slow and getting hit by enemies drains her MP, which ends the transformation when it runs out. Amusingly, enemy automatons will fall in love with her on sight, following her around and even fighting other enemies for her.
-   Curly Brace is one of these in _Cave Story_.
-   There's lots of them in the Japanese MMO _Cosmic Break_, such as Crimrose and Lily Rain.
-   In _Dokapon Kingdom,_ female characters who use the Robo-Knight character class turn into robot girls with floating ponytails that turn into wings.
-   The Elemental Dolls from _DoDonPachi DaiOuJou_ and the Elemental Daughters from _DoDonPachi DaiFukkatsu_.
-   _Endless Frontier_ gives us Aschen Brodel, Haken's android friend and voice of reason, who pulls triple duty as not only the Robot Girl, but resident Deadpan Snarker AND Genki Girl all in one package (depending on whether she's overheated or not). KOS-MOS and T-ELOS from _Xenosaga 3_ (the game is a Massive Multiplayer Crossover) are also there.
-   _Enemy Zero_ has one. Laura, the player character.
-   _Etrian Odyssey III: The Drowned City_: The female version of the unlockable Yggdroid class is somewhat unusual in that, while cuter than the male counterpart, is far more visibly robotic than how the trope is usually presented. While the face is visibly human apart from the color and eyes, the rest including the hair would have no chance of being able to pass as human. Olympia meanwhile has a more proper face and hair and is able to convincingly pass as human for a good chunk of the game. That is until she removes her cloak and reveals her body to fall into more SkeleBot 9000 territory.
-   The E-series of _Gadget Trial_ are at least partly biological versions of this, made from biometal. Each is supposed to be the equivalent of a full military unit in power, and they create more of themselves by a sort of mitosis.
-   _Galaxy Angel II_ has Nano-Nano Pudding, who is a living Nanomachine colony who resembles a young girl (although she's capable of Voluntary Shapeshifting to alter her appearance) as one of the available love interests.
-   Tio from _Grandia II_.
-   The main character in _The Guardian Legend_ is a robot girl that transforms into a spaceship. She's given no name in the English version, though in Japanese she was named Miria.
-   In _Infinite Space_, Mad Scientist Gavriil Minas takes a broken HELP Android (The In Game Encyclopedia) and makes in to one of these. She has 5,000 kelvin Degree cutting claws, her eyes shoot laser beams and she has the best combat stat in the entire game.
-   Junebug from _Kentucky Route Zero_ has gray skin and makes mechanical noises when she walks, and is finally revealed to be a robot late in Act III when she tells Ezra she was built to clean up the Elkhorn mine.
-   Orianna, the Clockwork Lady, is a playable champion in _League of Legends_, modeled after a ballerina. In the original lore she was built by the father of a real girl who died while training to join the League, while after the Continuity Reboot she’s instead a Ship Of Theseus—namely, the result of her father replacing parts of her original organic self as they failed from a poison she had contracted helping out from a chemical spill in Zaun’s Sump—with Orianna herself replacing her healthy heart with a Hextech Crystal to give her father a transplant in turn. In game (as developed for the original lore), she’s a very creepy and unnerving individual, imitating humanity while lacking human characteristics. In the new lore, she acknowledges her lost humanity while being curious as to what she is now—and whether there are others like her.
-   Herbert, from _The Legend of Dark Witch 2_, is an android that leads the elite group of researchers that make up the first set of bosses. She is capable of flight and her area of expertise is _alchemy_ of all things.
-   _Luminous Arc_: Despite having a pronounced evil edge to her Iris, the Steel Witch is very cute. She also talks like a Dalek.
-   _Lunar Knights_, the robotic attendants at the Solar Bank and the store and also the seemingly more human robotic female aide to the the resident Mad Scientist.
-   _Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of the Superheroes_: The Secret Character known as Shadow Lady is Chun-Li from an Alternate Universe who was forcibly turned into a brainwashed cyborg for Shadaloo. In retaliation for foiling their operations, Shadaloo kidnapped and robotized Chun-Li for the sake of transforming her into M. Bison's top assassin. Unlike Shadow — a brainwashed Charlie Nash, who escaped shortly after being transformed — Shadaloo added a Restraining Bolt to Shadow Lady's programming so she would remain fully loyal to them, essentially turning her into a emotionless minion. In her ending however, Shadow Lady overcomes Shadaloo's brainwashing, regains her original memories as Chun-Li, and allies with Shadow in taking down Shadaloo.
-   In _Mass Effect 3_, when Shepard travels to the Mars base, s/he encounters a Dr. Eva, who is actually a robotic infiltrator sent by Cerberus. Eva's body is disabled and taken back to the Normandy to recover data. Eva reactivates, but EDI, the ship's AI, is there to stop her. In the subsequent AI combat, EDI seizes control of Eva's body and subsequently uses it as a physical avatar.
    -   Not only that, but EDI has the potential to become Joker's Love Interest in Eva's body, especially if the Synthesis ending is chosen.
-   Roll and Splash Woman from _Mega Man (Classic)_, plus Alia and Iris (among others) from the X series, Alouette and others from Zero. (It's also not unheard of for Zero to be mistaken for one.)
    -   Naturally, when Roll appeared in _Tatsunoko vs. Capcom_, _Viewtiful Joe_ was more than a little attracted to her.
        
        _"A cute robot girl that's also a maid? You know, there is such a thing as overkill."_
        
-   Being a Spiritual Successor to the _Mega Man_ series, _Mighty No. 9_ brings us Call, Mighty No. 2 Cryosphere, and Mighty No. 3 Dynatron. Ray/Raychel is also this, though it isn't as obvious.
-   Another Spiritual Successor, _20XX_, has Nina, the Mega Man-equivalent player character.
-   _METAGAL_ has Meta and her eight sisters, who she has to fight to return them to normal after they've been reprogrammed into battle robots. One of them<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  even has a Gender-Blender Name.
-   _Metallic Child_: Has Rona, the first Metallic Child ever born. She lost the ability to move by herself, and thus is reliant on the player to be her guide through the game.
-   _Metaloid Origin_ has Erika and Neva. It also has Zeta, who is a robot _boy_, even if it is hard to tell.
-   Patricia Wagon the main character in Mighty Switch Force! is a cybernetic cop (first game) and/or a firefighter (second game). Although some official material states that she's a Cyborg as opposed to a full robot.
-   Marina Lightyears, the protagonist of _Mischief Makers._
-   As of _Mortal Kombat 11_, Frost, Sub-Zero's Distaff Counterpart and hated rival, is a Cyber Lin Kuei. Her body had undergone significant cyberization, such that some of her animations show her head and arms being easily detachable.
-   Miss Marshmallow from _Mother 3_.
-   Experimental Princess Farrah Day from _Nefarious_, who was designed to be the perfect princess.
-   In _NieR: Automata_ there are the YoRHa units, combat androids sent by the surviving humans on the moon to combat the alien robots that has invaded Earth, the female unit 2B being the main character. Devola and Popola also return from the original _Nier_, or to be more exact, two Devola and Popola model robots who are unrelated to the previous ones.
-   Shinatama, is an android or SLD (simulated life doll) who was subsequently Kidnapped, Tortured, and Blown Up. She acts as a liaison to the main protagonist Konoko in _Oni_.
-   _Persona_:
    -   Pictured above: Aigis from _Persona 3_, an anti-Shadow war machine built in the shape of a human because (it was believed at the time) only a human can summon a Persona, which is the only way to fight Shadows effectively, and that The Mind Is a Plaything of the Body. That turns out to be true in more ways than one; while she starts out with a very robotic affect, as she interacts with the rest of the cast, she grows more and more human. FES added Metis in "The Answer," though strictly speaking, she isn't actually a robot, but a personification of Aigis' internal conflict.
    -   _Persona 4: Arena_ adds another one, Labrys.
    -   _Persona 5 Strikers_ adds yet another one named Sophia, codename: Sophie. Though since she doesn't have a physical body in the real world like the prior examples she's more of a sentient computer program than a traditional example.
-   In _Phantasy Star Online_, the raCaseal character class were Robot Girls, and most of their costumes were maid like, including a large bow on the back and a skirt. One of their hairstyles even had a little hat appropriate for a nurse or maid. They were joined in _PSO: Episode 2_ by huCaseals. Their costumes were more ninja-like in design.
    -   The sequel _Phantasy Star Universe_ has 'casts' as a playable robot race. They can be male or female, and are hugely customizable in looks, from barely human looking to your classic Robot Girl Maid With Antenna. Kinda unique in that if you wanted to, you could have a sexy _male_ robot running around. Furthermore, there are multiple supporting NPCs that are casts. One of the more plot relevant is the pink haired Lou, who features significantly into episodes 1 and 2 of the game. Also, an early trailer for the game indicates that one of the main heroines was a 'cast,' but was eventually replaced by the newman Karen Erra.
        -   Introduced in _Phantasy Star Portable_ and later appearing in the main version of the game, Vivienne is a model of a new type of cast. Running repeated missions with her gives the player a unique opportunity to sculpt her personality as she asks you questions about her enviroment. You can, in fact, have her call you "master."
-   Continuing from the above, _Phantasy Star III_ and _Phantasy Star IV_ both had them. In _III_, there is an entire "race" of sentient mechanical humans (called cyborgs in the localization due to a mistranslation, though they have no organic components; later in the series, they're called androids like in the Japanese to reflect this), represented mostly by black-and-silver Wren-types (male) and Mieu-types: lithe, leotard-clad, claw-wielding, red-haired and overall more human-looking Robot Girls. In _IV_, the Robot Girl who joins your party is Demi, a unique model that some fans speculate is a custom design of Wren, a thousand-year-old Wren type.
-   ANI from _Phoning Home_ is a robot with a head and arms on top of a ball that identifies as a female.
-   Raki Saionji, from _Piece Of Wonder_.
-   KARA from Quantic Dreams' latest tech demo.
-   Ernula from G.rev's _Senko no Ronde_ is an android girl that also consists of several duplicates of her. Cuilan, an android _boy_, is often be mistaken for one. Ranatus from _DUO/2_ also fits this trope.
-   _SIGNALIS_: Replikas are mass-produced bio-mechanical androids built to perform various menial tasks, according to their make and model. Each model uses a human template for both appearance and personality. Replikas are almost exclusively female; of the nine or so Replika models described, the only males are the ADLR units, which are one of the rarest types. The main character, an LSTR (Elster) unit, is based on a soldier from the Great Offscreen War, making her a stoic survivalist good at tolerating isolation and high-stress environments.
-   _Soaring Machinariae_: All of the automatons shown in the game are female, including the protagonist Iris.
-   _Soul Calibur IV_ has Ashlotte, a robotic Elegant Gothic Lolita sent to capture Astaroth. Her profile describes her as being "something that would eventually be called a machine," which makes sense when you remember the series takes place in the **16th century**.
-   _Starbound_: The Glitch are an entire race of sapient robots (who, because of certain reasons, believe themselves to be living in medieval times), so half of them qualify. You can play as one, as well as invite them to live in your homes and work on your crew.
-   One of the stranger examples in video-gaming was the adjutants from _Starcraft I_ and _StarCraft II_. Though a robot, in _Starcraft I_, it was initially seen as a bald, bio-mechanical woman's head that had a robot voice. They were redesigned in _StarCraft II_, that appeared to be cuter, less explicitly human, and not like a borg. Being initially a face and a voice, the adjutant had some of the least potential to be sexualized. Cue _Starcraft II_, which produced the cuter, more feminine adjutant, cue the fanart. In the later missions, there's also another adjutant that played a bigger role in the plot, and you could tell just by looking at her.
-   Lamia Loveless in _Super Robot Wars Advance_ is also a biological version. Though not seen in-game, in the OVA, she bleeds and has mechanical parts for body.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   Tabatha from _Tales of Symphonia_.
    -   Incarose from _Tales of Hearts_ basically defines all the dangerous things in this trope. Also Corundum. In fact, almost every robot in the game, regardless of gender, is pretty much crazy. Except Kunzite.
    -   _Tales of Graces_ has the Humanoids, robotic children which are varied between boys and girls. Most notably, though, is Protos Heis/Sophie, as well as the adult Emeraude, though in her case, this isn't revealed until her "death", as she was a robotic clone of the real Emeraude from centuries ago.
-   Alisa Boskonovitch from _Tekken 6_.
-   _Triggerheart Exelica_: Triggerhearts Exelica, Crueltear and Faintear.
-   _Unreal Tournament 2004_ has a bit of a send-up of the character type with Devastation, Liandri's latest domestic gynoid entered in the tournament as a marketing stunt. Her status as Super-Powered Robot Meter Maid is handwaved with the explanation she's in the tournament to demonstrate the model's agility and AI adaptability (her armored shell and combat abilities don't come standard) and her womanly figure is described as being based on a "popular adult holoactress" in another bid to boost sales.
-   Miss Bloody Rachel from _Viewtiful Joe 2_ is a good example. She was built specifically to take down Joe and Silvia but instead is befriended by them. And then she gets zapped, frying her circuits, but it's not permanent.
-   Tesse from _Waku Waku 7._ She's also a Robot Maid.

_Xenoblade Chronicles_:

-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 1_: Fiora becomes one due to being made into a Faced Mechon. She becomes human again in the ending.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles X_: All the human women would count as this, due to the humans using mimeosome bodies in the voyage fleeing from Earth's destruction. They plan to use them while exploring Mira until they reclaim the Lifehold where they can be transferred back into their biological forms.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 2_:
    -   Poppi is this game's version of the Xeno series tradition of having one of these as a party member. Poppi is an Artificial Blade built by Tora, a Nopon who wanted to be a Driver but didn't have the potential. Her initial form, Poppi α looks like a little girl, Poppi QT <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , her Mid-Season Upgrade, looks like a Robot Maid and her final form, Poppi QTπ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is designed like an idol singer.
    -   KOS-MOS from _Xenosaga_ is also in the game as a Rare Blade, with T-Elos following her in a later update.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_: This game keeps the tradition alive by adding Ino to the Expansion Pass. Similar to Poppi from the previous game, Ino is an Artificial Blade built by a Nopon who couldn't become a Driver otherwise. Except that doesn't actually make any sense in Aionios; the strange nature of the world means that everyone has abilities similar to Blades, and Drivers don't exist. The Ouroboros are therefore very confused by Ino.

-   Emeralda from _Xenogears._ Despite being a nanomachine colony that can freely morph into nearly any shape, she usually takes the form of a cute young girl, an appearance which came from her "parents" (previous incarnations of the main characters). Or, if an optional (but quite easy) Side Quest is completed, a hot green-haired woman. Who quickly becomes the most powerful character in the game.
    -   From the same game, Tolone, the cyborg girl representing the Elements. According to Xenogears Perfect Works, her body is 90% cyberized.
-   KOS-MOS from the _Xenosaga_ series is the canonical robot girl, with a surprising twist at the end.
    -   Momo from the same series, as a Realian, also qualifies, though Realians are organic rather than mechanical.
-   A.D.A. and Pharshti in the _Zone of the Enders_ series are both similar in concept to Dolores (see the anime section), although A.D.A. ain't quite as self-sufficient (She can't move her frame by herself like Dolores and Pharshti can).

    Visual Novels 

-   Tanya and Julia from _Bionic Heart_ are androids. Both can hold their own in combat, and Tanya often serves as the Innocent Fanservice Girl.
-   Kotomi Ichinose from _CLANNAD_ isn't actually a robot, but Tomoya commonly compares her to one mentally, due to her blank expressions, total lack of social skills, and incredible memory and intelligence.
-   The titular _Lucy ~The Eternity She Wished For~_ is one who also has emotional responses.
-   Yumemi (Reverie in the Fan Translation) from _Planetarian_.
-   Colonel Sebastian Moran in _Shikkoku no Sharnoth_ used to be a biological human, but her body appears to have been almost entirely replaced by Engine Machines. As a little girl, she was the Sole Survivor from a small village destroyed by a Metacreature attack; when on the brink of death she was both saved _and_ rebuilt into a Robot Girl by M, which is the reason why she's completely devoted to him.
-   Stella Silver from _Shining Song Starnova_ is a prototype android designed to be the perfect Idol Singer.
-   Multi from _To Heart_ is probably the earliest example of this trope in a Dating Sim context.
-   Ilfa, Silfa, and Milfa are a trio of sister robot girls in _To Heart 2_ and its various spin-offs.
-   Luna from _Virtue's Last Reward_ is a robot girl.
-   R-Komadori from Cute Monster Girl\-themed Eroge _Princess X_ is the robot girl love interest, and the princess of an empire of machines hidden in the Antarctic. Aside from a few visible seams on her body she's almost indistinguishable from a normal human, unlike the lesser machines of her empire which look more like standard robots (or less; her personal maid 42 is a large floating cylinder which can only communicate by repeating _"Jawohl Mister")._

    Webcomics 

-   _Angel Moxie_: Ms. Konk. Her creator makes some drastic changes to her, revamping the scary old lady robot to a bubbly, ditz, with a body like a supermodel.
-   Eve from _Applegeeks_ is a robot made, predictably, from a Mac computer to be a girlfriend for Hawk. Some of her first actions in life are wrecking Alice's (Windows) PC and _detonating an Apple store_ because she was _jealous_.
-   _Ask Dr Eldritch_ has Helen, the Doctor's Robot Maid. He really hates it when people call her a Sexbot, though, so don't.
-   _Ayuri_: Aside from being made of plastic, Kay seems like an ordinary human woman.
-   _Bigger Than Cheeses_ has two robot girls: The Ditz Lei and sex fiend Cleo (which often crushes her chosen beau Thanatos with her comic-robot-level strength)
-   _Comedity_: Alice, a girl with robotic looks, who due to the comic's Life Embellished nature is the stand-in for the author's computer.
-   _Commander Kitty_ has the Alpha Droids aboard Zenith Central. Along with Zenith herself, Nin Wah's clone, and a good portion of the galaxy's population.
-   _Dresden Codak_: Fitting the cyborg part of this trope is Kimiko Ross, whose legs, an arm, a eye, some of her spine are all cybernetic post-Hob, and she even has an input jack in her upper back.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Susan initially mistakes Grace for one of these thinking Tedd couldn't have possibly have a real girlfriend and must have made one instead.
-   Kotone of _Experimental Comic Kotone_, although she's so realistic-looking that none of the characters that weren't explicitly told so (that is, everyone except for the nameless protagonist) don't realize that she's a robot. She also fits the Token Mini-Moe and Not Blood Siblings requirements (_ExCoKo_ is a parody of a Dating Sim).
-   Prism from _Flaky Pastry_ turns out to be one.
-   The Muses (and Princess Anevka) from the webcomic _Girl Genius_. Otilia, the Muse of Protection, easily the most badass-looking Robot Girl of all time.
-   Aversion in _Gunnerkrigg Court_: Jones is not a robot.
-   Aradia in _Homestuck_ becomes one, although in this case it's a ghost of a girl that's posessing a robot body.
    -   And then she explodes and comes back to life again as a time goddess.
-   _Jayden and Crusader_ has two, Computer and Computer Version 2. The first one was temporarily almost a main character, but the second one showed up twice and was never seen again.
    -   Computer came back and boy is she angry.
-   Evalyn Zeronius/Zero-Girl from _Iron Violet: The Shy Titan_ is a combat robot girl with super-speed. Humorously, she is capable of having emotion, but is unable to express it properly, causing her to be constantly deadpan.
    
    **Yuri:** So you're a fan of the Magical Princess Knight Celtia games too?  
    **Evalyn:** \[emotionless\] Affirmative. Her whimsical girlish adventues excite me. I am giddy with anticipation for the new game.  
    **Yuri:** Y-yeah...I can...see that...
    
-   42 of _Kiwi Blitz_ is this, imported from a friend of Mr. Frohlich who lives in Japan.
-   _Last Res0rt_ has two types (debatably): CG-86 is referred to as a "Defective Stepford." Gangrel and the Cybees, on the other hand, are a little too small and plush to be "typical" robot lasses, and we've already seen male versions as well.
-   _Magic and Physics_ has one in the form of Morgan Lillup. Which could constitute as some form of accomplishment as it is a Stick-Figure Comic.
-   Played a little bit with Momdroid from _Mechanical Buddy Universe_. She was originally never built as a female and is just a completely androgynous combat android. However after she discovered a war orphan she decided to adopt, she put on artificial skin to give herself more human appearance after the child was intimidated by her initial looks. And as luck would have it, she had a female face lying around amongst her possessions. She later commissioned for additional parts to further complete her appearance. She does however seem to have something of a complex about her adoptive son seeing her without this fake face even though he is much older now and not as easily scared as when he was a baby.
-   Ping from _MegaTokyo_ (remember that both, especially Megatokyo, are largely influenced by manga); notice, however, that Ping _does_ have a modesty programming, and seeing Largo in his boxers can make her panic. She also has a programme routine which means that although she is “anatomically correct” she retains discretionary control over this.
-   Sulla from _O Human Star_ is one. She's not that sexualized, but she is very cute.
-   _Questionable Content_ has many, many examples dues to the existence of AnthroPCs and their ability to use a humanlike chassis. There are a lot seen throughout the series, but the most notable are below:
    -   The first and most seen was Momo, Marigold's Moe Anthro-PC. Originally looking like a chibi schoolgirl, in strip 2000 she upgraded to a more human-proportioned body later (but still looks somewhat young and anime-ish. Momo is a curious example in that she has been specifically shown on at least three occasions to have an active libido, but for reasons of her own, presents as a more-or-less pre-teen girl. Momo is implied to be “anatomically correct” (not least, the Running Gag about “eel handling” in her original chassis) and May appears to believe this, but her pre-teen appearance makes this a subject best avoided.
    -   Momo also presents the dilemma of the cost and financing of robot girls. Idoru appears to be a commercial enterprise, selling AI bodies which appear to cost as much as a car, for no clearly defined purpose. This becomes a plot point between Momo and Marigold. It doesn’t appear when Hannelore buys Winslow a chassis, but Hannelore is implied to be independently wealthy so can presumably afford it.
    -   May is a robo-convict who first appeared as an avatar inside Dale's smart-glasses, as a (reluctant) AI helper. She later got out of Robot Jail and went to crash with Dale in a proper (albeit ill-maintained) body. May is another example of the cost/benefit issue, because her (state-provided) chassis is clearly at or near the end of its useful life, and has no funds available to maintain it. May certainly **isn't** "anatomically correct." (This doesn't stop her having **some** kind of sex with Sven, though.)
    -   Bubbles, a former combat droid who worked in the same underground fighting ring as Faye. The ring was run by Corpse Witch (yes that IS her name), another example of this trope but one that errs more on the 'robot' side. Bubbles’ take on the cost/benefit issue appears to be that HER chassis appears to be military-surplus; the termination of the programme meant that she was allowed to retain it upon discharge, but Corpse Witch implies (and Bubbles appears to believe) that the government could reclaim it at will. Bubbles’ anatomically correct status isn’t known. (Although Faye hasn't complained).
    -   Various minor characters may, or may not be. Melon, a recent minor character, doesn’t appear to be, and is quite happy walking about wearing only a sweatshirt. Officer Roko, no information. Seven is more of a Tin-Can Robot although she DOES have an electronic libido, by her own account. None of the “Male” robots have been shown to be anatomically correct.
-   Orphaned Series _Rumble Fall_ over at Wirepop had Demeneos the mechdoll, an Expy of KOS-MOS.
-   _Shortpacked!_ has UltraCar's current form, a redhead with retractable rolling skates.
-   _Skin Horse_ has Violet Bee, actually a drone remote-controlled by the mysterious Goldbug. Her/its creator later links the body to Nick Zerhakker instead.
-   Oasis of _Sluggy Freelance_ was originally revealed to be a robot, though later plotlines revealed this to be false.
-   _Times Like This_ has Nicki, the Robotron-brand MIRA, or Multifunctional Interactive Robotic Assistant. Manufactured in 2023, purchased secondhand by Cassie in 2027, and now living in the present time.
-   Doris in _Val and Isaac_ is an adorable, blue-haired female robot. Her girlfriend Minnow is certainly very fond of her.
-   _Yosh!!_ counts many robot girls as characters: Miyo, Nami, Toyoko, Lien and Rieko, a robot fox girl with the soul of a human. It is stated that their creator, Shiden, made thousands of them (all female) and occasionally uses them to attempt to conquer the world.

    Web Original 

-   The short story "And," combining this trope with hints of What Measure Is a Non-Human?.
-   _Destiny Factor_ has two; Sammy 64, who looks about Terry's height, and Virus... who'd stand out in a crowd due to height. Virus is debatable due to another set of genetalia she has...
-   Several works by James Franzen include robot girls, most notably _MTC Saga_.
-   Sweetie Belle in _Friendship is Witchcraft_ is very blatantly robotic, yet nobody, including her family or herself, ever notices. In a case of Dramatic Irony, she accuses her biological (but less empathetic) sister Rarity of being one.
-   _Girl Robot_, a Web musical.
-   The Japanese branch of hololive has a high-spec robot girl named Roboco. Aside from her obviously mechanical arms and legs and her three-toed feet, she's nearly indistinguishable from a regular human.
-   _The League of S.T.E.A.M._ has a clockwork cyborg girl (R.O.S.E.) used for zombie hunting.
-   Deconstructed in the Creepypasta _My Father's Hiding Something in the Attic._ After dying in a car accident, a girl's mind was digitized and placed in an imperfect android, which causes her crippling pain. While it was attempted with her mother, something went wrong, leaving her trapped in the computer.
-   Penny Polendina from _RWBY_. Penny's character is an allusion to _Pinocchio_, being a highly-advanced android designed to have a personality and the ability to generate an Aura like a normal human, to serve as the inventor's daughter (and an Atlas military asset, because the doctor needed funding from _somewhere_). She is a curious and friendly girl, eager to understand human emotions and relationships while worrying that she is not a real girl. Towards the end of Volume 3, she's destroyed in the Vytal Festival, strangled by the strings of her own weapon during the fight with Pyrrha. In Volume 7, she reappears, having been rebuilt, though it's noted that due to the method of her creation, this would be the only time. Her humanity is affirmed when she's given the Winter Maiden powers by their previous bearer at the end of the season, chosen over the intended candidate thanks to displaying greater warmth and kindness to the elderly woman. However, she ends up dying once more at the end of Volume 8, with the cruel irony of this final death occurring just moments after having become a flesh-and-blood human.
-   SCP Foundation provides a rare example that is sex-free - if only because it's an actual girl - with SCP-191, Cyborg Child. It is a girl who was kidnapped and suffered Unwilling Roboticisation by a Mad Scientist, that even rendered her horribly disfigured (most notably, the left half of the face and skull and her jaw were replaced by robotic implements).
-   Laurel from _Skyway Mechanix_ is a very realistic robot.
-   Female golems in _Tales of MU_, especially Two, are the Magitek equivalent.
-   _Teen Girl Squad_: In Issue 15, Japanese Culture Greg tries to date a clunky robot named Chizuko and gets "UNCANNY VALLEY'D" to death for his trouble.
-   She's my little bit of heaven, even better than real life, / She's the version 2.7 motor-actuated wife.
-   _Nightmare Time_: Emma's double is revealed to be this, and is determined like hell to take over her life, even if it means murdering the original.

    Western Animation 

-   The _Batman Beyond_ episode "Terry's Friend Dates A Robot" is about the school's biggest nerd suddenly getting a very attractive girlfriend. As the episode title already spoiled for you, she turns out to be a robot that he commissioned from the same company that makes Batman's robotic training dummies. Eventually he gets her reprogrammed to act more like a real girlfriend, which results in her becoming lethally jealous of the new female friends that the nerd gains through his new-found popularity.
-   _Beverly Hills Teens_: A robot girl is rendered on Chester's computer monitor during the intro—Then in a bright flash, she's right _outside next to him_.
-   The title characters from _Challenge Of The Go Bots_ also have gender (Crasher, Small Foot, and Pathfinder being the most prominent female cast members), but with the significant difference that they are _cyborgs_ (in the Brain in a Jar sense) rather than true robots, and so they probably _do_ have biological gender, at least on a neurological level.
-   _Dan Vs._: Ilsa, a one off character from "Technology," is a robotic aid to CEO Barry Ditmer that takes the form of a human woman. She speaks in a robotic cadence and has various technological accessories. Her name is also meaningful, being an A.I.-cronym for "Independent Logistics and Security Android."
-   _Green Lantern: The Animated Series_ has Aya, an artificial intelligence that builds herself a robot body (in 2.1 seconds!) when Kilowog tells he she needs a body to be a Green Lantern. Also counts as Spaceship Girl.
-   In _Kim Possible_, the heroes were tasked with tracking down a woman who had allegedly stolen robotics technology from her older male former partner, a self-proclaimed robotics genius. She and her boyfriend are completely unhelpful when they reveal they talked with her partner. In the end, it turns out no, no, she's human, it's not that. Rather, _she_ was the genius roboticist, the former partner was a fraud trying to steal her glory, and _her boyfriend_ was a robot.

-   The American Mega Man cartoon made Roll not only older and more attractive looking, but also a serious Action Girl, which Mega fails to recognize. In the first episode, she one-shots Fire Man _with a vacuum!_
-   An American twist on the trope: Jenny in _My Life as a Teenage Robot_ is less interested in saving the world than hanging out with high school kids, even though she can certainly hold her own in a fight.

-   Honorable mention goes to Sari from _Transformers: Animated_, a Half-Human Hybrid of Cybertronian and human. Her heritage gives her circuitry under the skin and hands that unfold into blasters, combined with a human digestive system, possibly nervous system and skin, among others. In the beginning of season 3 she receives a self-induced upgrade, going to being more machine than man, fitting the trope more accurately.
    -   Many female Transformers also fall under fembots.
    -   _Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen_ has Alice, the hottest Decepticon ever.

    Real Life 

-   Japan, of course, is working on making them a reality This, this, and this are some examples.
-   JSK Robotics is currently building a robot that looks a bit like a cross between Shinji and Rei
-   ELIZA, the parser program designed to fool a Turing Test by rephrasing anything that is said to it as a question, was presented to testers as being a live woman. Its designer was later appalled when some people started hailing this bit of transparent stage trickery as true artificial intelligence.
-   An inventor in Canada has been building Aiko, a robot in the design stages that is intended to be capable of everything from household chores to security duties to, yes, "companionship."
-   SVEDKA\_GRL, the mascot of a brand of Swedish vodka, has Hartman Hips, the Most Common Superpower, and is in general hot enough to float over the Uncanny Valley in a peculiarly alluring manner.
