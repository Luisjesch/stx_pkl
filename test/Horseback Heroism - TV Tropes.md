_Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?  
Late at night I toss and I turn  
And I dream of what I need!  
I need a hero!_

Combine a Rearing Horse, a Big Damn Heroes rescue, some guns or a sword, a pinch of Dramatic Wind, and you get Horseback Heroism. The sight of "Lightning" rising up on his hind legs while thunder cracks in the background is enough to tell everyone involved that the Day is well and truly Saved.

This is an old trope, though this hero is by no means riding a "dead horse" when he uses it to rescue friends or lovers. It's just that awesome.

Updated versions may substitute a Cool Bike or Cool Car for the horse. In which case you can expect My Horse Is a Motorbike.

Not to be confused with The Cavalry, who only sometimes ride literal horses.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Cesare - Il Creatore che ha distrutto_, The Watson Angelo has his Meet Cute with the titular Cesare Borgia when Cesare rescues him on his faithful horse Romulus. (The Moody Mount that was trying to throw Angelo off is named Remus, and was a gift from Cesare to the head of Angelo's association. Angelo eventually learns to ride Remus, and Remus is given to him, allowing him to join Cesare as a horseback hero).
-   _Kaiketsu Zorro_: As staple of _Zorro_, the anime also uses the trope basically at least once per episode.
-   _Moriarty the Patriot_: In chapter 73, William arrives in Vermissa Valley to save Sherlock (and Billy) where they're pinned down in a bar by the enemy, on a white horse and a sword.
-   In _Revolutionary Girl Utena_, Akio swoops in on horseback in the nick of time to save Utena when she falls off of another horse. Of course, given that he's systematically working on molding Utena to fit the classic "princess" role, it's strongly implied that he orchestrated the whole thing so she would further associate him with her childhood prince.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   Dark Knight Gaia/Gaia the Fierce Knight and his retrained versions invoke this, as this monster's whole aesthetic is about being a badass knight riding a mount. Gaia is often given badass moments to show this trope off, such as defeating Saggi when Yami Yugi is in disadvantage, destroying the Cocoon of Evolution to prevent the summoning of the Perfect Ultimate Great Moth, the ritual animation sequence of Chaos Soldier/Black Luster of Soldier, defeating one of the Big Five, or when Yami Yugi resurrects Gaia from the Graveyard to reveal that he predicted in advance that the Sangenma/Three Egyptian Gods would be defeated.
    -   The Nameless Pharaoh and his servants ride on horses to chase after Thief King Bakura. The Doma arc, which knows of the content of the final arc, foreshadows in the first half of the arc by making Yami Yugi ride Rebecca's horse to go after Raphael.

    Comic Books 

-   Batman does it in _The Dark Knight Returns_ after a nuclear EMP strike knocks out all motor vehicle transport.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Modesty Blaise_: When Sir Gerald's would-be assassin is fleeing on a motorbike in "The Killing Distance", Willie chases after him on a horse. And it's awesome.

    Fairy Tales 

-   In fairy tales classified as types ATU 314, _Goldener_, and ATU 502, _The Wild Man as Helper_, the hero is given a horse and armor to fight in a war to protect his father-in-law's kingdom. For example: _Iron Hans_ and _King Goldenlocks_.
-   In Norwegian tale _The Princess on the Glass Hill_ and its variants, the hero tames three horses of different colours and rides each of them to reach the princess atop a steep glass hill (sometimes as part of an "Engagement Challenge").

    Films — Animation 

-   _Shrek 2_:
    -   Spoofed with Prince Charming, who rides to rescue Princess Fiona from her tower, only to find the ogre Shrek had gotten there well before and rescued her already.

-   Many _Zorro_ films feed this trope. Zorro's signature pose is raising his sword on top of a rearing horse.
-   Done in _The Lone Ranger_, especially in the scene where the Lone Ranger and Silver appear _on top of a building_ to lasso a gatling gun.
-   In _The Good, The Bad, The Weird_, Do-won comes charging into the Ghost Market on horseback to save Man-gil from Chang-yi. He later charges into the middle of a Japanese cavalry troop.
-   _Gladiator_ opens with a Big Badass Battle Sequence in which General Maximus leads Roman cavalry into action against a Germanic tribe, even though Roman tactics were actually centered around their infantry. It does however enable to make our hero to look more badass than if he were leading the action from behind a shield wall. In his first gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum, Maximus ends up on a White Stallion taken from the charioteers he's fighting.
-   An Invoked Trope in _And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself_.
    -   Villa is skeptical about Raoul Walsh, the American actor sent to portray him, and so the two men compete in showing off their horse-riding and shooting skills. Fortunately Walsh is good enough to satisfy Villa.
    -   During the train ambush, Thayer sets up his cameras under fire, points them back at the train and shouts "ACTION!" Cue Villa and his cavalry riding out of the rail cars straight into battle.

-   _Hot Fuzz_: When Sergeant Nicholas Angel returns to take on the conspiracy, he rides into the town square on horseback at a casual canter, wearing enough weaponry to outfit a platoon.
-   In _Sunset_, Tom Mix and Wyatt Earp are flying to Mix's ranch to rescue Tom's girlfriend Nancy from gangsters when engine trouble forces their plane down. Discovering they are only 15 miles from Mix's ranch, they borrow horses from a couple of friendly cowboys, and come charging to the rescue on horseback.
-   _Jumanji: The Next Level_: When the heroes are surrounded by mandrills and it looks like this is going to be the end for them, they Alex (as 'Seaplane') comes galloping in on a black stallions and scatters the mandrills.

    Literature 

-   The Rohirrim, Gandalf on Shadowfax, and various other instances in _The Lord of the Rings_.
-   A frequent occurrence for _Zorro (2005)_.
-   Occurs a couple of times in _The King's Justice_:
    -   Duncan fights for his life when his army is surrounded by Loris' troops and the main Mearan army, then casts a spell for a diversion while ordering Dhugal to leave and warn Kelson.
    -   Kelson and Morgan, riding with their forces, cast spells to save Duncan from arrows as he's being burned at the stake.
-   Sandor Clegane's rescue of Sansa in the second book of _A Song of Ice and Fire_ certainly qualifies, even though technically he's afoot at the outset. Still counts, though: he appears in the nick of time, prevents her from getting pulled off her horse and raped, swings up onto her horse in front of her, and gallops her to safety through a rioting mob. Another instance is his rescue of Arya when she suicidally tries to save her mother at the Red Wedding. This one's odd because he _does_ show up a horse (as lightning illuminates the scene, even), and _does_ ride up to her at a gallop while rain pours and thunder rolls...and then whacks her unconscious with the flat of an axe. (So that he can take her away from the unfolding slaughter.) Heroic!
-   The deghans in the _Farsala Trilogy_ clearly _think_ they're this, and in the beginning they are - it's mentioned that Farsala is one of the few countries to have an effective cavalry. However, they are easily defeated by Hrum foot soldiers.
-   _1632_: Morris Roth, in the novella "The Wallenstein Gambit"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , assumes the role in the defense of Prague from Holk's mercenaries, but not just with the traditional rearing horse and sword waving. As the defenders first gathered he did all that, but when Holk's goons showed up the next day, Roth, riding a horse borrowed from Pappenheim, simply kept his uptime rifle close to hand, ready to use. His coolly awaiting the arrival of the mercenaries served the purpose of calming his poorly trained troops far better than the sword waving routine.
-   In the second _Time Scout_ book, Skeeter uses his hard-earned horseback skills to win a duel in the Roman arena, then pole vault out and save a friend from slavery.
-   _Journey to Chaos_: After Nolien mana mutates into a unicorn, Tiza rides into battle like a mounted knight.
-   _The Empirium Trilogy_: During the annual horse race, Rielle sees a horseless Audric about to be attacked by assassins from an enemy country. Without a second thought, she rides to where he is and uses her powers to stop their assault.
-   The Heralds of Valdemar invariably ride graceful white horses, who are their Bond Creatures and reincarnated comrades-in-arms. Heralds who've completed their Equitation classes can do anything on horseback that they can do on foot, including diving headfirst into a river to rescue drowning victims.
-   _House Of Night_ vampyres dislike technology, so every House has a stable of fine horses and offers its students training in equestrianism. This comes in useful in _Hunted_, when the heroes escape Neferet's grasp by fleeing her House on horseback. It's a risky endeavour, since the streets are dark and covered with snow, but they eventually get to safety.

    Live-Action TV

-   The fifth episode of _Burn Notice_, "No Good Dead", features the Cool Car variant. Michael says, "When your back's against the wall and time is running out, there's nothing like seeing an old friend." Cue the Cool Car moment as the perfectly restored 1973 Dodge Charger (destroyed at the end of the last season) comes screeching into frame, driven by Fiona.
-   _Doctor Who_: At the climax of "The Girl in the Fireplace", the Doctor jumps a horse through a _mirror_ to save the day.
-   _Game of Thrones_: Lyanna Stark is officially introduced galloping at the Winterfell grounds.

Nowhere in the pages of history can one find a greater champion of justice! Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear! From out of the past come the thundering hoofbeats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!"

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Exalted_, most characters with ability-based charmsets like the Solars and Sidereals can do this to one extent or another. The Solars invoke the trope the hardest though, particularly Hero Rides Away.

-   The boxart of _BIONICLE_'s special-edition Toa Lhikan & Kikanalo set depicts the hero Lhikan riding the rearing beast, despite the fact that in the story, he never shares a scene with any Kikanalo.

-   The _Assassin's Creed_ games give you a button specifically for making your horse rear up.

-   Bartz of _Final Fantasy V_ comes riding in on his charger to save Lenna, and then Lenna and Galuf. This being _Final Fantasy_, though, his charger is a chocobo. And the chocobo kind of had to talk Bartz into the second instance.
-   In _Paladins_, you start each match, and return after each respawn, riding into battle on horseback to get to the battle faster.

(And if you think about it, he's trying to do this to impress another _pony_. What would they think of this?)
    -   He does it again with more success while he is in the shape of a humanoid dragon-knight during the shared dream in _Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?_, choosing a giant-sized Derpy Hooves as his mount and the Pegasus mare enthusiastically going along with it.
