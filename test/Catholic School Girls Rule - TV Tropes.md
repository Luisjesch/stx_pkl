_"Catholic school girls. The uniform's what does it for me."_

The belief that girls who attend Roman Catholic schools are sexy and/or promiscuous by their very nature. (After all, how else do you end up with all those Naughty Nuns?) Any accurate resemblance to reality is purely accidental.

As Roman Catholicism teaches that sex is to be strictly reserved as part of marriage, it is widely believed that children in Catholic families or attending Catholic schools are not taught about sexuality in a way that promotes an informed understanding of themselves, their bodies, or sexuality in general.

This feeds into an idea that, since Catholic girls supposedly know nothing about these things, they would therefore be a lot easier to seduce than more "enlightened" girls who "know better". Alternatively, even those who know differently may feel that a Catholic girl striving to be innocent is a desirable virgin, making for a greater challenge to seduce, and thus a "greater prize" if she can be wooed into the bedroom.

There's also the notion (which is sometimes Truth in Television but usually just wishful thinking, given the fetish-fantasy nature of the trope) that a seemingly chaste schoolgirl may only be going through the _motions_ of chastity and religiosity for the benefit of parents, teachers, and clergy, similarly to a Seemingly-Wholesome '50s Girl, and is just itching for a chance to reveal her less-than-holy side the moment no one's looking, with all that repression leading to a simmering cauldron of typical teenage hormones just looking for a chance to boil over in a plethora of exciting ways in an attempt to rebel.

And of course, for some, there's good old nostalgia, as plenty of Catholic school alumni can fondly remember (and perhaps embellish) their own hormonal teenage years. Alternately, those who actually attended a Catholic school for a decent stretch of time may be much _less_ prone to this trope: seeing a uniform (especially one involving skirts and dress shirts) worn by both attractive and unattractive girls, possibly even one's own family members, for years on end can make one lose interest in the uniform rather quickly.

Regardless of the (admittedly squicky) reasoning behind it, the trope has led to the fetishization of the standard "schoolgirl uniform", Catholic or otherwise, frequently modified to Stripperiffic specifications. This outfit usually consists of a button-up shirt, sometimes worn with a tie (in more exploitative media, the shirt is worn without a bra, and knotted so high up that the girl in question is simultaneously baring her midriff completely and showing off a _lot_ of cleavage); usually a blazer or jacket of some kind, and frequently a couple of sizes too small; a short, pleated skirt that may or may not be in some kind of plaid; knee-high socks or stockings; polished black loafers or Mary Janes; and often pigtails. Oh, and you can expect panty shots to be a frequent occurrence... unless, of course, she's not wearing any. Needless to say, any girl who actually shows up to class like this would be thrown in detention faster than you can say "Jailbait." The uniform will sometimes be depicted as being worn even outside of school.

When this outfit shows up in films and TV shows, it's almost always done through Dawson Casting. Likewise, when it's done by fully-grown women, it's almost always a case of Fanservice in action.

In Britain, where the trope isn't associated with Roman Catholicism to quite the same extent (due to uniforms being much more common in both private and state primary and secondary schools), this look is identified with the "_St. Trinian's_ Girl", after a series of Boarding School comics and subsequent live-action film adaptations of that name. The trope is also more broadly regarded as being squicky in the UK since the style of uniform is more strongly associated with the real children who wear it there. Most real-life schools with this kind of uniform opt for an office-wear dress code rather than actual uniforms for sixth form (final two years, so 16-18-year-old) students, making this style of uniform a more specifically child-like look. St Trinians skilfully avoided any accusations of bad taste by limiting the girls to only two distinct types, the Lower 4th (who were the exclusive focus of Searle's cartoons) who were a group of feral little monsters who were barely human and the Upper 6th(added to Searle's original anarchic concept to give the films some sex appeal) who were (literally) uniformly hotties who were 20 if they were a day. This trope has an Eastern equivalent in Joshikousei, a fetishizing of Japanese schoolgirls wearing another distinctive uniform.

This trope's Spear Counterpart is arguably the Mormon Missionary: young men often from sheltered backgrounds living in close quarters with other young men doing God-knows-what behind closed doors (most likely religious study but don't tell that to a fetishist). Though in this case, the outfit itself usually isn't sexualized but the idea of a repressed young person with simmering sexuality below a prim and proper exterior is all too familiar.

This trope is slowly becoming discredited, since many real-life Catholic schools have changed their uniforms to polo shirts and khaki pants and skirts, especially as more schools come to realize that what looks pure and innocent on a nine-year-old can take on a rather different context (intentionally or otherwise) when worn by a 16-year-old after the "summer growth spurt."

A subtrope of Adults Dressed as Children. Compare and contrast Preacher's Kid. Not to be confused with Naughty Nuns or Nun Too Holy.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Referenced in the Exam Battle side stories of _Sailor Moon_, as Rei goes to one such school and gets some attention from men purely due to the uniform (even if it's a sailor outfit), while Minako got scoffed at by her public school uniform, much to her chagrin.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Discworld_ of A.A. Pessimal, the canonical setting of the Convent School of the Spiteful Sisterhood of Seven-Handed-Sek (SHS) is expanded upon and is revealed to have the Discworld's equivalent of Catholic Schoolgirls. Compared to the Assassins' School,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  SHS is more mainstream and typical of the sort of general education the Disc gives to its daughters. Who are tended by kindly and caring nuns with a deep commitment to educating their charges and turning out well-adjusted young ladies. It's not _their_ fault they get girls like Shauna O'Hennigan and Rebecka Smith-Rhodes-Stibbons.

    "Crash and burn, space-jockey!" gloated a Maquis at the adjourning table. "Don't feel bad. That dame's as prickly as a Martian cactus."  
    "Maybe." Paris was too experienced a Lothario to give up at the first knockback. "Half-Venerian, half-Brazilian, and raised as a convent girl. Could be interesting..."
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _5ive Girls_: This Syfy original movie revolves around "sinners" who are sent to a Catholic reform school and are forced to wear naughty schoolgirl outfits. The events of the movie turn two of them into lesbians for some reason. Bizarrely, this may even be justified, since everyone involved is either part of a conspiracy with a demon or being manipulated by someone who is, and the girls are being groomed for sacrifice.
-   The teen girl protagonist of the Mexican film _Amar Te Duele_, is shown to be attending an exclusive all-girls Catholic school, as expected, in other scenes, her classmates are shown drinking heavily and doing drugs.
-   _Bedazzled (2000)_ (2000) Elizabeth Hurley's Devil wears a schoolgirl outfit, as one of a whole series of Fanservice-type costumes.
-   _Cabin Fever 2_ plays this trope for maximum squick in a scene featuring a stripper in a midriff-baring, miniskirt-wearing Catholic schoolgirl costume and bearing a burst cold sore (an early sign of the flesh-eating disease featured in the film, for those of you playing at home). Her performance goes overall fine until she takes off her top and reveals that her breasts are ''covered'' in pustules. (One of her spectators indicates that he would still tap that.)
-   _Catholic Ghoulgirls_: This no-budget film features these as the main heroines. It also features some arrestingly hammy action poses.
-   The late 19th C. equivalent occurs in _Colette_. Willy develops a fetish for women dressed as Claudine in her schoolgirl smock.
-   _The Craft_: The girls all attend a Catholic School, and their uniform seems to be worn quite conservatively for the most part, but when Bonnie's scars are healed, she drops the tights (in favour of a Grade C Zettai Ryouiki), tie and blazer to invoke this on purpose.
-   _Cruel Intentions_: Both Sarah Michelle Gellar and Reese Witherspoon do the Catholic Schoolgirl thing.
-   _Deadtime Stories_: "Little Red Running Hood" opens with Rachel taking off her school uniform and running her hands all over her body as she fantasizes about her boyfriend.
-   _D.E.B.S._: _And_ Girl on Girl Is Hot, in a tiny-budget film about a secret government all-girl spy training academy, whose uniform is like this whether studying or on a mission. Their sworn enemy, Lucy Diamond falls for the best student after seeing her in their uniform.
-   _Dogma_: Salma Hayek as Serendipity is wearing a schoolgirl uniform and working as a stripper when the protagonists first meet her.
-   In _Election_, Tammy Metzler ends up being sent to a Catholic girls' school by her parents (a prospect that actually delights the teen lesbian, though she begs her parents not to make her go there). At one point we see her trying on a uniform and being visibly turned on by it.
    
    "Catholic school was great! I mean, the teachers kind of sucked, and they were supposedly way more strict, but you could get away with _murder_."
    
-   In _Eternal_, Irina dresses as a private school girl when she lures a boy away from the bus stop and feeds on him.

-   Tom Stahl's wife does a cheerleader routine before having sex with him in _A History of Violence_.
-   _Jennifer's Body_: While she isn't actually a Catholic schoolgirl, Jennifer is shown on the poster wearing this kind of outfit, which shows off her long legs. She doesn't wear this in the film, however.
-   _The Kentucky Fried Movie_: This is the entire point of the parody sexploitation film trailer _Catholic High School Girls in Trouble_. The iconic clothing doesn't actually make an appearance, mostly because there is very little clothing involved at all.
-   _Kill Bill_: Gogo Yubari, one of O-Ren Ishii's Elite Mooks, dressed in a more realistic Catholic schoolgirl uniform. Interesting, considering she was Japanese, and thus more likely to appear in Sailor Fuku. Possibly another hint at how "off" she was.
-   Referenced in _A Life Apart Hasidism In America_ when one Hasidic woman says that the Hasidic school uniform skirts extend at least four inches below the knee and claims that the longest Catholic school skirts are five inches above the knee. She's obviously ill-informed.
-   In _Lizzie Borden's Revenge_, Vanessa spends the movie a very short plaid skirt and white blouse knotted underneath her breasts, white knee socks, and black high heels.
-   _Loving Annabelle_: All of the school girls wear the stereotypical uniform, while none of them we see actually _follows_ Catholic rules on sexuality (Annabelle being a prime example, with her same-sex affair).

-   _Pretty Persuasion_: Discussed between two male teachers who actually work at a Catholic girls' school. Also, while the teacher who is later accused of statutory rape by the Fille Fatale protagonist is in fact completely innocent of that crime, he does ask his adult girlfriend to dress up as a student.
-   _Scary Movie_.
    -   In the first movie, Shannon Elizabeth's character gets this, gunning for Rule of Funny and Rule of Sexy.
    -   _Scary Movie 3_ has Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy in schoolgirl outfits.
-   Referenced in _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World_, when Scott admits with a certain scandalized pride that Knives is an actual Catholic schoolgirl, with the uniform and everything.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows_: Megan Fox (as ace reporter April O'Neil) disguises herself as a nympho schoolgirl in order to blend in with a group of women on a bachelorette party so that she can gather intelligence on the villains.
-   The _St. Trinian's_ series is set in British Boarding Schools for young ladies. While all the younger students are crazy-evil the sixth formers (aged 16-18 (legal age in the UK being 16)) all wear their uniforms as small as possible.
-   Diane, in _Trainspotting_. Subverted in the fact that Renton has no idea she's underage when she picks him up (out of uniform, natch) at a club.
-   In the opening of _Transporter 2_, Frank is unsuccessfully carjacked by a Zettai Ryouiki girl in a pleated tartan skirt. After wiping the floor with her carjacking gang, he suggests she's got some homework to do. She runs off.
-   The 'cool girls' on _When Evil Calls_ wear their uniforms so they resemble St. Trinian's girls; especially Molly, the school's resident sex bomb. Karen deliberately invokes this when she attempts to seduce Mr. Dale by perching on the edge of his desk in an extremely short plaid skirt with the top buttons of her blouse undone under her tie.
-   _Wild Things_ gives Denise Richard's character a non-plaid variant for the threesome scene. It's not there for long.
-   _William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet_ has the rowdy Montague boys Lecherous Licking their own nipples and shouting "I am a pretty piece of flesh!" at a busload of Catholic schoolgirls. The girls shriek in delight and the old nun at the wheel steps on the gas to get them out of visual range as quickly as possible.
-   _The World's End_: Friday nights at The Mermaid are called "School Night". All the girls dress like this; the boys dress like Catholic schoolboys, too. Even Basil gets in on the act, dressed as a professor in cap-and-gown. Apparently this was all the Network needed to do to get DNA from Peter, Andrew, and Gary.
-   In _Zombies! Zombies! Zombies!_, Harley's stripper costume is an abbreviated schoolgirl uniform.

    Jokes 

-   A bus from a Catholic school for girls crashed, killing all onboard. They gathered up at the pearly gates and Saint Peter came out with a bowl of holy water. He asked the first girl if she had ever acted inappropriately with a boy, and the girl said she had kissed one once. St. Peter said she merely had to dip her lips in the water and she would be free to enter. The next girl had touched a boy once. St. Peter said she merely had to dip her hand in the water and she would be free to enter. Suddenly there was a ruckus at the back of the line as a girl pushed her way forward. Saint Peter said, "There is no hurry, everyone will get a turn." The girl responded, "I just want to gargle before Cathy has to put her butt in it."

    Literature 

-   Realistically averted with Laura Denker in _Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret._ She's the tallest and most developed girl in the sixth grade, and all the boys stare at her. But she attends public school, she is not as fast or slutty as the other girls assume, and her Catholicism is only briefly seen when she goes to confession after school—and just before it, Laura calls Margaret out directly on how she _knows_ how everyone talks about her and that she's tired of it.
-   Used for Fan Disservice in _Goodbye Darkness_ by William Manchester. While on a WW2 battlefield, the author sees a hallucination of a sexy New England schoolgirl who tries to incite him out of his foxhole to his doom. When viewed up close however she has rotting flesh and jagged teeth.
-   In Stephen King's _Hearts in Atlantis_, one of the main characters, Pete Riley, remarks that Catholic school girls give the best handjobs; he's changed his mind about a lot of things, but that's not one of them.
-   In Simon R. Green's _Hex and the City_, a Nightside novel, John Taylor sees the succubus Pretty Poison dressed in a girl's school uniform. As succubi appear differently to each individual, as fits their personal sexual fantasies, John Lampshades this trope by musing that he must've seen too many St. Trinian's films as an adolescent.
-   In the Kate Daniels novel _Magic Strikes_, Kate asks Raphael if he has a costume kink: nurse, French Maid Costume, et cetera. He responds instantly with "Catholic schoolgirl". He then starts imagining his crush wearing a Catholic school uniform and tunes out of the conversation with Kate.
-   In _Wicked Lovely_, Aislinn and co go to a Catholic school. It isn't gone into much, given that the series tends to be pretty cynical/dark/serious in tone, but Leslie definitely fits this stereotype. At least until she was raped. The guys who harass Aislinn in the first book also comment on this, pulling on her skirt, etc.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _8 Simple Rules_: Bridget wears a schoolgirl uniform for Halloween and even her grandfather thinks she resembles a stripper.
-   _Alias_: Jennifer Garner dressed as a Catholic schoolgirl.
-   On _As Time Goes By_, Sandy goes to a policeman's ball where the women dress as _St. Trinian's_ girls and the men as policemen. Jean and Lionel find this squicky until they see that Sandy has decided to dress as a fourth former, and the policemen are dressing as Keystone Kops.
-   _The Benny Hill Show_, plenty of the "Hill's Angels" wear this outfit as occasionally so does Benny himself.
-   _The Big Bang Theory_: In the episode "The Anything Can Happen Recurrence" it's mentioned that Bernadette sometimes dresses up as a Catholic schoolgirl for sex with Howard. At the end of the episode, Amy tries to make up with Sheldon for lying to him by dressing as one herself - unsuccessfully.
-   In one episode of _Boy Meets World_, Shawn gets excited when he finds on the subway a group of Catholic schoolgirls who "ditched their nun" (and yes, they were wearing the uniform).
-   Played for laughs between Danny Reagan and his partner in _Blue Bloods_:
    
    **Jackie:** I used to wear one of those. Christian Leadership Award four years running.  
    **Danny:** What happened?  
    **Jackie:** I discovered boys. Then I was hiking up that short skirt...  
    **Danny:** Great, now I have to think about you in that uniform all day.
    
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_
    -   Darla, a vampire who's at least four hundred years old, dresses like a Catholic schoolgirl because she is taunting Angel for being in love with teenage Buffy, despite the fact that Sunnydale High doesn't require uniforms. Darla's also wearing that outfit to get boys. As in 'to get dinner'. Check out the opening sequence of the pilot episode, when she's wearing that same outfit to lure a leather-jacket-clad tough guy into a place where she can bite him. It's a great take on the usual Sex Signals Death scene in slasher films. If you don't know Darla's a vamp, it's got a huge HSQ.
    -   21-year-old Buffy dresses in a plaid skirt while dressing younger in order to seduce 17-year-old jock RJ in "Him".
    -   Faith informs Spike that she used to wear a schoolgirl's uniform for an ex-boyfriend who liked to whip her (fans speculate this may be the character of "Spanky" from Angel).
    -   Similarly, in its spin-off series _Angel_, Lilah dresses as a schoolgirl to jointly seduce Wesley and mock him for being in love with the bookish geek girl, Fred. She succeeds in seducing Wesley, but when he tells her to leave the glasses on, the expression on her face suggests he may as well have said Fred's name during the height of passion, it stung that much.
    -   In the season 8 comics, one of the slayers wears one to lure a vampire to get information from him.
-   The Athenian Academy uniforms in _Caprica_. Technically, they're not Catholic but Greek polytheists but in virtually every other way it applies. Plus, at least two of the girls _were_ monotheistic, though not Christian, much less Catholic.
-   While not Catholic, the school uniform in _Deep Love_ is very similar to this and one of the johns in the first episode was very adamant when he said Reina and Ayu had to be in their school uniform.
-   Defied in _Degrassi_. First Clare wore something approaching your standard schoolgirl uniform. But it was played as childish, not sexy. Fiona's time in a New York prep school included her attempt to redesign them to be this, but we never got to the endpoint of that. When Degrassi itself experimented with using school uniforms they were designed to be as unflattering as possible. This Truth in Television; as is the fact that the girls seem to have wasted no time figuring out how to shorten the skirts without permanently doing so.
-   The main cast of _Derry Girls_, though as this is set in Catholic-majority Ireland this is the standard. They're not particularly promiscuous, except for Michelle, at least in her personality and general image (she refers to guys she likes or at least hot guys in general as "absolute rides", for one).
-   _Doctor Who_ had Time Lady companion Romana wearing a very _St. Trinian's_ style uniform in the "City of Death" serial. Lalla Ward, judging by interviews and the production notes, came up with the idea and didn't realize it was a fetish.
-   _Glee_ is set in a public school, but Rachel Berry tends to favor this kind of attire. And is routinely mocked for it.
-   _Gossip Girl_: most of the girls have a very...unique...take on the Constance Billiard uniform. One reviewer commented that the St. Jude's boys must feel like they're on the set of a porno every single day.
-   _Grange Hill_: Mostly averted. The students (except for the sixth form, 17 & 18 y/o) all wear school uniforms, but as they're played by actual school-aged children, they dress appropriately in actual school uniforms. A few of the 15 and 16 y/o girls do seem to get away with wearing high-heeled Mary-Janes, but that's the extent of it.
    -   The school teaching staff, however, held a sponsored "teachers dress in your old uniform" day to raise a little extra money for essential equipment. Two of the three female teachers wore their old school uniforms, of which one actually looked too little girl and cutesy to count for this trope, but the second was practically was a textbook definition of the trope. (The third female teacher came in her old-fashioned "cap and gown" teaching attire from when she started in an old Grammar School.)
-   _Greg the Bunny_ has an episode in which a girl uses the Catholic Schoolgirl meme to lure Seth Green into a compromising position and blackmail him.
-   In _Grounded for Life_, Lily has to go pick up uniforms as part of her school's switch to a uniform dress code. As Lily tries on a uniform and shows it to her dad and his brother, she laments "Who's gonna find me attractive in this?" Sean and Eddie look at each other as if they're both thinking "Don't say it. Let it drop!"
-   _House_: In "House's Head," he has a hallucination in a sensory deprivation tank of Cuddy in a schoolgirl outfit. She isn't in it for long though.
-   _How I Met Your Mother_: Marshall and Lily's stripper daughter wears a variation of this when performing and even when made pregnant by an elderly Barney. Robin also wears one at the beginning of her DVD, making the gang assume she has done porn but it is actually the introduction to her "Let's go to the mall" teen pop video.
-   _Inspector Morse_. In "Last Seen Wearing", Morse and Lewis are in a car watching the teenage girls at an expensive private school play hockey. Morse mentions how grateful he is to whoever it was that invented the sports skirt and made it a compulsory uniform.
-   _The Kids in the Hall_ once had a sketch where a diner was next door to a Catholic high school, and the two guys working there were always ogling the girls who came in, that is, until one of them, played by a pre-fame Neve Campbell, is arrested for killing her teacher...for ogling her.
-   _Las Vegas_: Sam informs Delinda that she likes to play "the naughty schoolgirl".
-   _Lingo_: The female co-host of this Game Show once wore a classic schoolgirl uniform.
-   _The L Word_: This happened in one episode for some reason.
-   One MTV spring break special hosted by Jerry Springer had two college guys admit to fantasizing about Britney Spears' "...Baby One More Time" video for this trope. Jerry, of course, teases them but does satisfy their fantasy by having two girls in schoolgirl uniforms come out and dance for them.
    
    **Jerry:** So your fantasy is you wanna wear one of those skirts?
    
-   On _My Name Is Earl_, Patty the Daytime Hooker went to Catholic school back in The '80s, and she transformed her uniform into the "sexy" version. 20 years later, she tries to invoke the trope again, but it doesn't _really_ work due to the toll that time (and working in The Oldest Profession) has taken on her body.
-   _NCIS_:
    -   Kate states that she spent twelve years at Catholic school. Tony asks her if she still has the pleated skirt. She's also wearing it when Dinozzo imagines her, post-death.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  When Dinozzo's imagination has an imaginary wind blow the imaginary skirt up around her imaginary waist showing her imaginary, and very skimpy, panties, imaginary-Kate is not amused!
    -   Abby has also been known to dress up like that.
-   Mischa Barton did it in _The O.C._. Not surprisingly, it was Sweeps Week.
-   On _The Office (US)_, Michael comments on the hot picture of a Catholic schoolgirl hanging near Stanley's desk.
    
    **Stanley:** That's my daughter. She goes to private school and I'm taking the picture down right now.
    
-   _The Professionals_. In "Where the Jungle Ends", Bodie and Doyle pretend to kidnap the villains' adolescent daughter dressed in her schoolgirl uniform in order to provide them with vital information. The girl in question expresses disappointment that they are unwilling to ravish her but Doyle excuses himself as having been "Not feeling well lately".
-   Gretchen in an episode of _Prison Break_. Obligatory gif<small>◊</small>.
-   _Saturday Night Live_:
    -   Subverted by Molly Shannon's "Mary Katherine Gallagher" character. Mary Katherine is a Catholic schoolgirl, all right, and wears the standard uniform, but though she may at times imagine _herself_ to be hot, the other characters (and the viewers) certainly don't.
-   _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_: in season 7 the Fates show up to try to guide Sabrina through her romantic troubles in the form of 3 teenage uniformed schoolgirls.
    -   Although Hogwarts, of the _Harry Potter_ franchise, is obviously not a Catholic school, one memorable _SNL_ sketch spoofing the Potter series featured guest host Lindsay Lohan as Hermione and played up the uniform fetish aspect, the outfit notably tighter in the chest due to her "developing" over the summer holidays.
-   Alexei Sayle, in his show _Stuff_ once said that his Jewish secondary school was next door to a catholic girl's school 'Or, as we called it, the Virgin Megastore'.
-   _Series/Scrubs_ . In the episode 'My Sacrificial Clam' when Elliot's boyfriend suggests they roleplay a scenario where she is a naughty girl called to the principal's office she immediately advocates buying a schoolgirl's outfit as soon as possible as she has work in the morning. When the female staff at Sacred Heart fawn over a handsome new gynecologist the character of Jordan dresses as a schoolgirl in order to seduce him.
-   _The Sweeney_. DS Carter makes some lurid comments about the attractiveness of girls in school uniforms in "Taste of Fear". On another occasion, Jack Regan is meeting an informant in the park when a couple of schoolgirls walk by and one of them bends over to pick something up. Seeing how Regan is Distracted by the Sexy the informant quips: "I could be arrested for doing what you're thinking!"
-   In _That '70s Show_, Starting in Season 5, Donna goes to a Catholic high school and has to wear the uniform for perfectly legitimate reasons. Doesn't stop the boys from going crazy over it (and even seems to appeal to Jackie).
    
    **Donna:** Man, what is with you guys and this uniform?
    
    **Fez:** It makes us want to corrupt you.
    
    -   Even Red makes note of her uniform when he sees Eric drooling.
    
    **Red:** I'm going to have to lock him in his room and pull his eyes out.
    
    -   The uniform is very not-Fanservice-y, with a knee-length skirt and shapeless blouse/sweater combo, and looks utterly hideous on Laura Prepon's rather zaftig figure.
    -   In another episode, Kelso states that he likes Catholic school girls because "they were never taught about sex so they don't know what not to do".
-   _Thunder in Paradise_: the character of Alison (Playboy Playmate Heidi Mark) turns up to the resort wearing a risque schoolgirl outfit (as she IS a schoolgirl) which she then strips off for a dip revealing her pink string micro-bikini.
-   The girls uniforms in _Tower Prep_.
-   In Tropical Heat PI Nick Slaughter takes a case involving a bevvy of beautiful teenage uniformed schoolgirls who almost inevitably turn out to be involved in drugs, prostitution and murder. He goes undercover as an English tutor teaching them 'Romeo and Juliet', his friend Spider pointing out it is the story of a doomed forbidden romance between an adolescent girl and an older man who both end up dead in the end.
-   The most memorable usage of this outfit in _Two and a Half Men_ is most definitely _not_ fanservice. In one episode, Charlie and Alan go to their mother's house to talk to her about something. She repeatedly tries to blow them off over the intercom, saying that she's busy. They're persistent, and she eventually comes to the door dressed like this. Their reaction is pretty much what you'd expect.
-   However Alan's 20-something girlfriend Kandi does indulge in this fetish for him, something which gains Charlie's approval ("Good choice"). He dresses as a priest for her.
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   In the episode 'Signs and Wonders', Mulder and Scully go to a church that practices snake handling and the following conversation takes place...
        
        **Scully:** Snake handling... didn't learn that in Catechism class.
        
    -   It might also be worth mentioning that Scully was raised Catholic... _and_ she had an affair with one of her professors in medical school.

    Music 

-   Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler first appear in Roman Catholic schoolgirl uniforms in the video for Aerosmith's "Crazy". Later in the video, they appear in less. Aerosmith is led by Liv Tyler's father, Steven Tyler.
-   The Hugo nominated "Fuck Me, Ray Bradbury", courtesy of Rachel Bloom, plays this trope for all it's worth. Happy Birthday, Ray!
-   The otherwise bewildering and impenetrable video to the Blue Öyster Cult single "Joan Crawford Has Risen from the Grave", which features a _lot_ of Catholic Schoolgirls in various stages of demurity, semi-dress, and vampirism, pursued by a seedy pervert with a stunning resemblance to keyboards man Allen Lanier.
    -   The BOC also use this trope in the album track "Unknown Tongue", in which a devout Catholic Schoolgirl pursues the mysteries of the Stigmata.
-   The Cocky Sticks' minor club hit "I'm a Catholic Girl, Of Course I Swallow."

-   Billy Joel's "Only the Good Die Young" is a partial subversion, in that Roman Catholicism could be seen as a stumbling block to the singer getting the goods. But only partially, because that stumbling block only makes the girl more attractive to the singer.
-   Lyn-Z Way of Mindless Self Indulgence often wears a slightly-less Stripperiffic version of a Catholic schoolgirl outfit during live shows.

-   The Trope Namer is "Catholic Schoolgirls Rule" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. According to Anthony Kiedis' autobiography, _Scar Tissue_, the inspiration for the song came from an actual teenage Catholic School girl who he slept with during one of his earlier tours.
-   Frank Zappa wrote "Catholic Girls" about Catholic Girls dabbling in oral sex.

-   The video for Sleigh Bells' "Infinity Guitars".
-   Every female human being under the age of 22 is dressed in a Roman Catholic schoolgirl uniform at the beginning of the video for Britney Spears' "Baby, One More Time...". Not so coincidentally, every female human being of any age had an automatic Halloween costume that year. Thanks, Britney! The video has been widely parodied and pastiched, most notably by model Charlotte Mc Kinney and her backing singers in the series 'Lip Sync Battle' in a performance that made the original look positively tame.

-   Queen inverted this big time in their "I Want To Break Free" video. We see a nubile schoolgirl from behind only for "her" to turn around and reveal it to be band member Roger Taylor in drag.
-   Divinyls lead singer Chrissy Amphlett had a fondness for performing in this outfit.
-   A rare non-sexualized example in Grimes' "Genesis" music video. Makes sense since Grimes was raised Catholic and went to a Catholic school.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Stacy Keibler showed up on the runway wearing a Roman Catholic schoolgirl uniform. Her appearance was the height of hotness. The reactions from the middle-age-or-older men around the runway were the height of terrifying.
    -   WWE has put on several "schoolgirl" matches, which give their female wrestlers an excuse to dress like this and beat each other with school-themed weapons like yardsticks to the delight of the audience.

    Video Games 

-   _Escape From St. Mary's_: The group of girls you talk to wear uniforms without using this trope, but the fashion show features students modeling uniforms to the sounds of "I'm Too Sexy."
-   _I=MGCM_: St. Charles Academy has schoolgirl uniforms that are already sexy, especially with a short skirt, and they don't seem to have strict rules about dress codes. Lilly has her Custom Uniform of Sexy, which is tight and has exposed cleavage, especially when she's being a Gyaru Girl. Marianne, one of the St. Charles schoolgirls and Lilly's best friend, is revealed to secretly draw NSFW doujins as well as general mangas.
-   _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines_: several characters wear variations on schoolgirl outfits, and some versions of the female protagonist can also don similar garb. It's explicitly being used as fetishwear and stripper outfits.
-   _Varicella_: If you look in palace courtesan Miss Sierra's wardrobe, a Catholic school uniform is one of her fetishistic outfits.

    Visual Novels 

-   Downplayed in _Princess Evangile_. On one hand, it _is_ an H-Game that features schoolgirls studying in a private school founded by a Catholic mission, so this inevitably happens once the protagonist picks a romantic route towards the end. On the other, many of the girls who study there are not promiscuous whatsoever, having never seen any young men their age up until protagonist Masaya's acceptance into the school as part of an "experiment".

    Webcomics 

-   In _Banzai Girl_, Jinky Coronado and her friends spend a lot of time battling monsters and aliens in their very short school uniforms.
-   In _Birthday Gift_, Anna tries to seduce a new student, Ginger. She's halfway there by the first... meeting.
-   The private school version rules in _Eerie Cuties_.

-   _Ennui GO!_: During a theme park field trip, newly-Amicable Exes Vanitas and Andromeda partner up for the sole purpose of flirting with the students of a Catholic girls' school that's also at the theme park. In the process, the latter finds out why there's a Catholic school in Key Manati; apparently, Naughty Nuns have to come from _somewhere_.
-   Subverted in _Everyday Heroes_ by Carrie, who is a devout Catholic, but goes to a public high school and dresses like everyone else.
-   _The Order of the Stick_: The trope is invoked by Sabine who decides that killing Roy while dressed as a schoolgirl will be a major turn-on for Nale.
-   _Wapsi Square_: When the Golem Girls first appear, they are dressed this way. And drunk.

    Web Original 

-   The Bad Catholic Girls, of John Kricfalusi's _The Goddamn George Liquor Program_.
-   _Hot For Words_, the youtube "phenomenon", has host Marina Orlova dressing up in this uniform with alarming frequency.
-   _The Nostalgia Critic_: In a Rare Male Example, the knowledge that the Critic went to catholic school (and you know how he grew up) put some _really_ dirty thoughts into fan's heads.
-   _Sailor Moon Abridged_, episode 12/13:
    
    **Serena:** Who died and made you school security?
    
    **Raye:** Satan.
    
    **Serena:** But you go to a Catholic school!
    
    **Raye:** Catholic girls taste better.
    
-   The characters in SOTF-TV each get alternate outfits inside their daypacks, usually either Fanservice-y, humorous or both. Naturally, a character (specifically, Mikaela Warner) gets this costume.

-   _Archer_: Archer had two prostitutes dressed as schoolgirls. Noodle Incidents ensued, apparently.
-   In the Britney Spears\-Christina Aguilera match on _Celebrity Deathmatch_, both wore an outfit like this, although the fight went from Fanservice to Fan Disservice (as they tended to do on the show) rather quickly.
-   Fruity of MTV's _Downtown_ dated a Catholic schoolgirl who turned out to be utterly psycho.
-   In _Family Guy_, Lois does sexual roleplay by dressing like one and doing a Coy, Girlish Flirt Pose.
-   _Hey Arnold!'s_ Olga Pataki.
-   The denomination of Penny’s high school in _Major Lazer_ is debatable, but she and her classmates definitely have the uniforms and the attitudes.
-   _O'Grady_: In "Cut the Cord," Harold is partnered with a Catholic school girl named Misty for a big brother/sister program, and he tries to resist falling in love with her.
