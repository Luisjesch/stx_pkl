_Been up since 6:30, two days crowded into one  
Put away the dinner dishes and my work still isn't done  
If I had three arms, I could do what I need to do  
There's too much going on to just get by with two_

You look in the mirror and see three heads looking back at yourselves with five eyes and seven arms and think to yourselves, how do we septo-wield? Or better yet, how can we write our book, cradle our baby, and make paper airplanes at the same time? Practice, that's how.

It is rarely explained how users of this trope have the coordination to pull all this off in the first place, since normal humans typically lack the skill to perform two different tasks with their hands. Justified in the case of extremely non-human entities which may have evolved to use their excess limbs in many different tasks at once with ease.

Please note this has surprisingly little to do with Excuse Me While I Multitask, if you're thinking about wielding weapons with many arms you still need some form of Multiarmed Multitasking; it just belongs in Multi-Armed and Dangerous. If your extra limbs are for walking, they belong in Spider Limbs or possibly Handy Feet. And then there's if it's just a Vertebrate with Extra Limbs.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Squid Girl_, Ika appears to specialize in this with her tentacle hair.
-   _Franken Fran_ oftentimes attaches her head to a special multi-armed body in order to perform particularly complex surgery.
-   Briareos Hecatonchires of _Appleseed_ fame possesses a cyborg body that includes the ability to control more limbs then he actually has, to the point of apparently running a aircraft carrier by himself, but is mostly shown using multiple guns in his Landmate.
-   Umba, Alita’s engineer in the Motorball arc of _Battle Angel Alita_, has a specialised robotic harness that features 20 arms, all of which he can control independently and perform the work of 10 engineers simultaneously. He uses them to replace all four of Alita’s limbs, damaged in a crash, in under six minutes.
-   Science teacher Ken Tatara in _Nurse Hitomi's Monster Infirmary_ has four arms, which he puts to good use (often gesturing with one or two arms while lighting a cigarette with the others).
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: The Gogyosen fight with a remote avatar that all five members control together. It can grow four extra skeletal pairs of arms to perform the hand signs for five times at once, either separately or together for more power.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Ironwood_, first mate Tif makes full use of all four of her hands while having a threesome with a djinn and a crewmate.
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   Doctor Octopus is very good at using his tentacles to do this. According to the most reliable source, he could use his tentacles in combination with his regular hands to do one complex task and two simple ones at the same time. And there were also several stories where the "complex task" was a heated battle.
    -   The 2019 _Spider-Ham_ mini has Ham meet Parker Peterman, an alternate universe Spider-Man who grew six arms and developed a hobby for each set that he does all at once. Even when he's rescuing Spider-Ham he's using a spare set to carve a wooden duck.

    Fan Works 

-   There was once a _Mortal Kombat_ fan fic where Sheeva was driving somewhere with the heroes, and had two arms on the wheel, one on the transmission, and one out the window (and no, it doesn't mention how she learned to drive).
-   _Zany To The Max_
    -   Sekoila Zarner has four arms and four legs, and she is a great example of this trope.
    -   Usually subverted with Wacka and Wakka. They have two arms each, so if the arms on Wacka's side are doing one thing, and the arms on Wakka's side are doing another, it doesn't count. However, if one of Wakka's (or Wacka's, it doesn't matter) arms is holding a book, while her other arm is holding a glass of water, it _does_ count.
-   Briefly shown in an _Oversaturated World_ sidestory. Ditzy is outside her universe and sees Sunset Shimmer holding the thing together with twelve arms, while using an additional four to heal the cracks in reality. Sunset also grows an additional head just to talk to her without getting distracted.
-   From the Parody Fic _B'Elannarella_
    
    Sprouting a dozen extra pairs of holographic arms, the Doctor launched into a fierce rendition of _Das Axtzeichen im Rücken des Bären_ by Netonostridarimachii, a piece that could normally only be played by an entire orchestra of Tonarian octopoids with multiple personality disorder.
    

    Films — Animation 

-   Kamaji in _Spirited Away_ operates the bathhouse boiler room. He has six spidery arms, which he uses to multitask: reaching into the hundreds of herb cabinets, pouring boiling water, grinding potions with his yagen (related to a mortar a pestle, but using a wheel in a narrow trough) and responding to wooden tags on ropes signalling requests from the bathhouse above.
-   _Monsters, Inc._: Mike and Celia book a reservation at a Japanese food restaurant to have a romantic dinner. The chef is a multi-armed monster who uses the extra limbs to prepare sushi at record speed.
-   _Monsters University_:A multi-armed monster is seen cramming for his final exams by holding up several textbooks and reading from them, and another is seen drinking several cups of coffee to stay alert.
-   _The Princess and the Frog_: During the la Boeufs' masquerade party, a guy in an octopus costume uses the tentacles to hold glasses of wine. When he sees a dog in a mermaid costume chasing two frogs wearing a disembodied giraffe's head, he looks baffled and pours out all his drinks at once.
-   _Treasure Planet_: Long John Silver isn't multiarmed but still manages to pull off this trope in the kitchen, thanks to his multi-purpose cybernetic arm with little armlets.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Men in Black_:
    -   The twin Mission Controls.
    -   The mail-sorting alien in _Men in Black II_.
-   From _Spider-Man 2_, Dr. Octopus does this when he rebuilds the new sun-generator machine, with his long metallic tentacles. Justified by the tentacles being intelligent in their own right and each one having its own camera.
-   _Star Wars: Attack of the Clones_ featured a restaurant run by a chef with four arms named Dexter Jettster a Besalisk, subverted in that the diner owner has only one primary arm.
-   At one point in _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_ the Voluntary Shapeshifter T-1000 grows a third arm to pilot a helicopter and load a machine gun at the same time.
-   The bar-tending octopus cartoon from _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_.

    Literature 

-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_:
    -   In _Life, the Universe and Everything_, Arthur's extreme Unknown Rival Agrajag has built a Temple of Hate devoted to him, the centrepiece of which is a giant statue of Arthur with multiple arms. He discovers that each one of them depicts one of the many, many times he has (unwittingly) caused the death of one of Agrajag's former incarnations.
    -   Subverted with Zaphod Beeblebrox, who gave himself a third arm and then does nothing at all with it. (Except, supposedly, ski-box.)
-   A four-armed One-Man Band appears in the _Discworld We R Igors Diary_.
-   Vyr Cossont in _The Hydrogen Sonata_ had an extra pair of arms added so she could play the fiendishly complicated instrument required for T. C. Vilabier's 26th String-Specific Sonata For An Instrument Yet To Be Invented, catalogue number MW 1211 (aka, the Hydrogen Sonata).
-   _Xandri Corelel_: The Ongkoarrat, who resemble six-legged sloth bears, can program a computer and knit a sweater at the same time.
-   One of the later books in the _Land of Oz_ series, _Handy Mandy in Oz_, features the adventures of a seven-armed goat herder named Mandy who comes from Mt. Mern, where everyone had seven arms. Early on she explains how she uses her arms for different tasks.
    
    "This iron hand...I use for ironing, lifting hot pots from the stove and all horrid sort of work; this leather hand I keep for beating rugs, dusting, sweeping and so on; this wooden hand I use for churning and digging in the garden; these two red rubber hands for dishwashing and scrubbing, and my two fine white hands I keep for holding and braiding my hair."
    
-   In _Inventions Of Professor Vagner_ by Aleksandr Belyaev the titular professor uses only two hands, but actually trained himself to multitask with his two brain lobes and two body halves. By looking in two directions at once with different eyes, dancing polka and waltz simultaneously with different legs and so on. At one point he uses his right arm and right eye to demonstrate his research to a journalist, while his left arm and left eye are busy writing an article.
-   The _Mermaids_ trilogy has Octavius the octopus. He's first introduced using two arms to push aside the curtain of his cave, two to wash his cooking pot, one to hold a plate of food, and three to eat. In _Rani's Sea Spell_, Rani and Kai meet Octavius's sister Flora, who styles the sisters' hair, using some of her arms as curlers.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Pilot from _Farscape_. One episode notes that having the _mental capacity_ for Pilot's specific brand of multitasking is very uncommon and more important than the multiple arms themselves, because Pilot is required to manage and regulate dozens on-board functions at once.
-   The short-lived 1970s sci-fi sitcom _Quark_ featured Interface, a four-armed alien woman who worked as an intergalactic switchboard operator connecting calls between ships.
-   _Kamen Rider Fourze_ has the Hand Switch, which equips Fourze with an extra arm (attached to his _leg_) that's outright stated to be for this. While he works on solving a math problem, it _disassembles a bicycle_. Thus far its not been shown to have any type of combat potential.
-   The 1979 pilot for sci-fi sitcom _Starstruck_ features Dart, a four-armed alien creature who is the drummer in a band aboard a space station. Based on the pilot, if the show had been picked up for series a big chunk of the humor surrounding this character would be him handling multiple tasks at once.

    Music 

-   Played with in Trout Fishing in America's "Two Brains", in which the narrator proposes growing extra legs and arms (and a second brain) to keep up with everyday life, so he can do more at once without being stressed out. The first verse is quoted at the top of the page.
-   "Who Taught These Idiots to Drive?" presents the image of the jackass at the wheel occupied so:
    
    One hand dials his cell phone  
    One hand combs his hair  
    One hand's on the radio  
    And one is in the air
    

    Myths & Religion 

-   Hindu Mythology several gods (including Shiva and Vishnu) are usually depicted with multiple arms each holding symbolic instruments like scales and scythes and swords.

    Radio 

-   _Earthsearch_. When Android Surgeon-General Kraken goes mad and decides to overload the fusion engines, Darv informs him there's a thousand safety interlock codes he'd have to remove first. Kraken proceeds to demonstrate just how quickly an android with six manipulator arms can enter a thousand codes.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _GURPS_ has the Multiple Arms advantage available for player characters, but you also need to buy special coordination to use them fully- otherwise they are only good for holding things, not performing more than one task at a time.
    -   In _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_, the Ananasi werespiders can take this ability, though it's a fairly high-level spell, since it requires a fair deal of mental skill.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_
    -   Techpriests often add an extra limb that's practically an industrial tool on a robotic arm. They often add on tentacle-like mechandendrites which can serve many roles, including manipulation. And then with their practically unlimited options for body modification, they can take on more traditional takes of this trope.
    -   When it comes to Chaos and natural mutations, extra limbs isn't common, but it's far from unheard of.
-   One of the Shticks in _Toon_ is the Coat of Arms, a device that produces a practically unlimited number of mechanical arms with gadgets on them that let you do multiple things at once.
-   One early _Dragon_ article about how many actions a _Dungeons & Dragons_ PC can reasonably perform per round cited a player suggesting that their PC would draw a weapon, hold up a shield, drink a potion, and _with their free hand_ do something else. The article quips that unless the PC in question happens to be a six-armed Type V (a.k.a. marilith) demon, this isn't reasonable.
-   The _Dungeons & Dragons_ monster called "Spellweavers" have six arms, which are explicitly able to perform multiple functions simultaneously. In particularly, they can cast multiple spells simultaneously per round, something few if any other creatures in the game can do.

    Video Games 

-   In _Magrunner Dark Pulse_, the six-armed Gamaji is the main character's mentor and can be seen in-game manipulating multiple data screens and holding a cup of coffee at once.
-   In the _Mortal Kombat_ franchise, with its four-armed Shokan race, there are two examples of this: Sheeva, the Action Girl Shokan, can pose with her upper arms in _Mortal Kombat 9_, while her lower arms clap(by using her opponent's severed arms and hands, instead of her own): and in _Mortal Kombat 11_, Sheeva uses her four arms to play musical glasses as her Friendship. Another, non-Shokan character, the Kollector( who, as a Naknadan, has _six_ arms), can use two of his arms to examine the pieces he rips off his opponent's bodies and stuffs into his bag, while at the same time shredding his opponent with his other arms, and for _his_ Friendship, he becomes a One-Man Band.
-   The _pipa_ ghost from _The Rewinder_ has three arms, and uses all three when playing his _pipa_ (a Chinese instrument similar to the lute. His third arm turns out to be detachable though, in a cutscene where he stops playing and pulls one of his two left arms to be put aside.
-   Subverted in the _Pokémon_ franchise with the four armed pokemon Machamp. Its pokedex entry specifically states that "Any delicate or complicated work causes its arms to get tangled up".

    Web Comics 

-   _Schlock Mercenary_:
    -   Played with and subverted — and then played straight for good measure. One of the mercs, a guy named Andy, belongs to a race of four-armed aliens. During his initial interview, he bragged about quad-wielding handguns, but Thurl just pointed out that he still only had two eyes, so no matter how many weapons he's got, he'll only hit one target. There has been incidents where he HAS used it, though — including wielding a two-handed assault-rifle and two handguns at the same time — but it's been purely for intimidation-value. Or sometimes just for fun.
    -   Schlock himself has demonstrated on multiple occasions that he can not only form extra hands when needed, but also use them quite effectively. The fact that he can have multiple eyes (if he can get hold of them) means he can aim at multiple targets.
-   _Spinnerette_:
    -   Spinnerette uses her six arms to knit — all at once and while using silk she produces herself.
    -   Later on, Sahira copies Spinnerette's arms in order to clean her apartment faster. She's then seen to clean 6 different surfaces at once.

    -   When not fighting evil, Ally, Reece and Sheila are not above using all four arms to cut corners in mundane activities.
    -   The entire Enchanter race, which is naturally four-armed, is built around this trope.
-   Snap Fahrenheit, the titular main character of _How to Raise Your Teenage Dragon_, is a four-armed dragon.
-   Lakshmi in _Brat-Halla_ is based on the Hindu goddess of the same name which gives her the requisite four arms. Puts them to good use on a date with Loki.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: Cio's Coat of Arms gives her two extra sets of limbs, which, in her first appearance, she's using to maintain the accounts for the Den of Iniquity where she works. They also give a huge edge to her Paper Master magic.

    Western Animation 

-   Celebrity chef Elzar in _Futurama_. His species was given multiple arms specifically as a Season 1 joke for how cooking shows go too fast for viewers to cook along.
