_"My friends... you bow to no one."_

In many stories involving royalty (but particularly movies), there is a scene where someone is standing in a crowd of people. As part of a Moment of Awesome, and sometimes preceding an Awesome Moment of Crowning, the camera pulls back, and the entire crowd kneels before the character, moving in a pleasingly symmetrical wave as they do so. The character, who may have appeared minor seconds before, becomes the focus of the scene. This is usually because of one of two circumstances: either the character is a king, princess, or someone else to whom they _should_ normally kneel, but in an unexpected situation; or the character is someone to whom they would _not_ normally kneel, but unexpectedly do.

In the first instance, the character is a King Incognito who has just thrown off his disguise, or the subject of a Really Royalty Reveal. In the second, the actual king may have humbled himself and bowed to the lowly hero who has just saved the kingdom. By courtesy, everyone else will imitate the king and go along with it. Commonly, in this case, an antagonist will also be forced to kneel to the hero, whom they have recently insulted.

This trope is a very sharp contrast to Kneel Before Zod.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Near the end of _Doraemon: Nobita in the Wan-Nyan Spacetime Odyssey_, Hachi's gang all kneels before Nobita after Nobita's animal headscarf had fallen off, revealing Nobita to be an exact duplicate of their "god", as depicted on their city's sacred, Sphinx-like statue of their guardian deity.
-   In the 2001 anime adaptation of _Fruits Basket_, Kazuma Sohma kneels respectfully in front of Tohru Honda after she manages to bring Kyo back from both his despair and Painful Transformation and ultimately carries his cat form in her arms and back home.
-   _Fushigi Yuugi_
    -   When Miaka agrees to be the Priestess of Suzaku, she is amazed that everyone bowed to her.
    -   They also bow to Mayo in the 3rd OVA, to her surprise.
    -   In _Fushigi Yuugi: Genbu Kaiden_, all of Hokkan bow to Takiko after her Heroic Sacrifice in summoning Genbu and restoring the country, finally acknowledging her as the Priestess.
-   _Ginga Densetsu Weed:_ In the end, all the dogs bow before Weed after he defeated Hougen and his father said he surpassed him.
-   In _Kill la Kill_, after Ryuko has been freed of the mind control Ragyo put her in, she takes the time to gripe on Satsuki for all her lies and manipulations during the first half of the series, demanding that she be allowed to punch Satsuki in the face as a measure of compensation. Satsuki eventually relents and agrees that, while she did manipulate Ryuko with the objective of using her to fight Ragyo, doing so lost its purpose the moment Satsuki used Ragyo's own methods. She then casts aside her pride and bows to Ryuko, asking her to help her fight against Ragyo. Ryuko is so thrown off by this sudden display of humility that she admits she no longer feels like punching Satsuki.
-   In _My Hero Academia_, All Might (who, though having recently used up the last of his power, is still considered Japan's greatest hero) prostrates himself in front of Midoriya's mother, vowing to devote the rest of his life to training Midoriya to be a proper hero that might one day succeed him as the Symbol of Peace.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   King Nefertari Cobra does this to thank the Straw Hat Pirates for saving Alabasta Kingdom and his daughter Vivi.
    -   King Riku gets two of these. The first is when his King Incognito disguise is shaken at the bottom of the trash heap where the fallen gladiators are discarded, and everyone around him, both gladiators and toys, bow before him. The second is atop the king's plateau during Doflamingo's game, when the distraught civilians, confused and not sure what to do (since their options are fight Doflamingo and his gang or turn in Riku and Doflamingo's other targets), bow to him, beg him to save them, and ask what they should do.
    -   At the end of the arc, Admiral Fujitora gets on his hands and knees and apologizes to Riku for Doflamingo using the Seven Warlords system to escape capture and take over the kingdom. What's more, he does this while a live video is being transmitted to other islands. In other words, one of the strongest fighters in the Navy, the World Government's prime military force, just admitted to the world that the government he works for royally screwed up. This gets him chewed out by Akainu later, since he considers admitting fault to be even worse.
    -   After saving the Mermaid Princess, Shirahoshi, Saint Mjosgard kneels to her father King Neptune, apologising because one of his kind tried to take her as a slave.
-   In the anime of _Sailor Moon S_, when Usagi/Moon defeats _both_ Michiru/Neptune and Haruka/Uranus in fair combat as their last test, both stop attacking and respectfully kneel in front of her.
-   _Time Stop Hero_:
    -   Princess Clau Belltree and her entourage bow to Kuzuno Sekai after he rescues them from the monster Dark Shoggoth.
    -   Princess Sayuki Takegawa and her people bow to Sekai after he rescues them from a bunch of vampires.
-   _The Twelve Kingdoms_ has the Crowning Moment Of Awesome when the main character Youko (who, for complicated reasons has been joining rebels that are theoretically rebelling against her) mounts her ki'rin (thus revealing herself as Empress) and the ENTIRE ARMY falls on its knees.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_, Chancellor Foster and all the students of North Academy bow to Chazz Princeton after he dethrones the Czar and becomes their best duelist.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Equestria: A History Revealed_, during the Civil War flashback, Celestia does this to the crowd of ponies at Trottingham to apologize to them for her own failures.
-   The Sailor Senshi do this to Nanoha (who in this story is the reincarnated Moon Princess) in _White Devil of the Moon_ when they meet her for the first time as senshi. Hayate promptly snaps a picture for posterity and points out that princess or not, Nanoha's in military uniform at the time, so they should bow instead of kneeling.
-   At the end of _The Elements of Harmony and the Savior of Worlds_, Granny Bonnie and Faust the Scribe bow to Megan, Molly, and Danny for everything they've done for ponies. Later, everyone in Equestria was about to bow to them the same way everyone bows to the Hobbits in _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_. But Megan will have none of that.
-   At the end of the first book of _The Elements of Friendship_, when Queen Celestia shows up, Twilight and her friends bow to her. Celestia says they don't bow to her, and instead, she bows to them. The Canterlot nobles follow suit, though many of them are simply hoping to get Celestia's favor.
-   In _The Confectionary Chronicles_, Hermione’s interaction with Loki often involves her kneeling to greet him as a sign of her worship, which Gabriel accepts as the Loki-pagan part of him enjoys the show of respect, but each party has a silent agreement that Hermione will kneel or bow before nobody other than her god, first shown when Loki stops her even bowing to Morgana. However, when Loki kneels to Hermione at one point to offer her a boon as thanks for her faith in his goodness, it reinforces the significance of what he is asking her; even Gabriel can’t recall kneeling before anybody apart from his Father. Hel also kneels to Hermione when the two first meet, although in this case Hel’s intention is just to offer Hermione comfort upon entering her realm rather than to show any kind of ‘submission’.
-   In _Tok'ra Apocalypse_, while nobody in the SGC actually kneels to Sam and Dean, Teal'c states at one point that they "deserve greater honour than any human can bestow" after their actions protected two whole galaxies from the forces of Heaven and Hell. When General Hammond meets John Winchester in Heaven, he assures John that the other man has no need to salute given how the SGC owes John so much for teaching his sons the lessons they have shared with Hammond's old colleagues.
-   _The Mountain and the Wolf_: Daenerys makes her Big Entrance by swooping down on Drogon and landing in the throne room. By the time her subjects and courtiers enter, she's sitting on the Iron Throne, Drogon helpfully spreading his wings at the most dramatic moment. Everyone kneels and starts chanting "Long Live the Queen"... except, of course, the Wolf, who instead draws his sword, salutes her with it, and makes his approval known with his usual subtlety and class.
    
    Blood! For the Dragonqueen!  
    Skulls!!! For the Iron Throne!!!  
    LET! HER ENEMIES! _BURRRRRNNNNNN!!!!!_
    
-   In the _Triptych Continuum_, the moment Twilight (already an alicorn princess at this point) meets Doctor Gentle, she promptly curtsies to him as a sign of respect for his accomplishments as both a midwife and somepony whose unique magical innovation has saved so many lives. And she _remains_ in that position until he verbally acknowledges the sheer awkwardness of it all before releasing her.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Mulan_, the Emperor bows to the heroine. The crowd hastily bows with him, and so does the slimy Obstructive Bureaucrat. Again, the music swells. Must feel pretty good for someone who has gone through the whole movie fearing and feeling she's not good enough. Doubles as both a heartwarming and awesome moment, as, just before that, Shan Yu had commanded the Emperor to Bow Before Zod, and the Emperor had calmly replied _"No matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow to it."_ That's right, folks, "the mountain" cannot bow to the "howling wind", but it does bow to Fa Mulan. In a bit of Fridge Brilliance earlier in the film, one could say Mulan caused a literal mountain to bow by singlehandedly triggering an absolutely **massive** avalanche.
-   Happens in _Kung Fu Panda_ twice. Once in a dream sequence at the beginning of the movie in which Po dreams he's such a legendary warrior that the greatest warriors in China, the Furious Five, bow in respect to him. Also happens in the endgame, when Po defeats the Big Bad and the Furious Five actually do bow to him and call him a Master.
-   In Disney's _The Sword in the Stone_, Wart doesn't know what to make of the fact that everyone, including his belligerent foster father and brother, is now kneeling to him.
-   _Wreck-It Ralph_: The racers of "Sugar Rush" who were mean to Vanellope (not of their own doing) now go to their knees, begging forgiveness, when the game reset restores Vanellope to her rightful place as the game's ruling princess, much to her own surprise.
-   In _Joseph: King of Dreams_, when Pharaoh renames Joseph "Zaphnath-Paneah" and puts him in charge of Egypt, Potiphar, Joseph's former master, conspicuously and gladly kneels to him.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In Peter Jackson's _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_, Aragorn and Arwen (just crowned) kneel before the hobbits (including Trope Namer Frodo). All of Minas Tirith immediately follows suit, the music swells, and as the camera pulls back, we see the four hobbits, standing in a mass of royalty and nobility... and they're the tallest ones there.
-   In _Ever After_, Danielle walks into the throne room, and everyone kneels, as her evil stepmother turns in rising horror... before also dropping to her knees. Her kneel is more like a collapse of defeat.
-   In most versions of Robin Hood, this occurs when King Richard reveals himself to the Merry Men.
    -   Parodied (of course) in _The Court Jester_, when the identity of the true king is revealed in a thoroughly embarrassing manner.
-   In _The Princess Bride_, Buttercup is the object of a mass kneel twice, though one was All Just a Dream, and one old crone does not kneel to protest her throwing away true love.
-   At the end of _The Chronicles of Riddick_, the title character receives this treatment from the entire Necromonger army after killing the Lord Marshal. The reason: you keep what you kill.
-   In _Star Wars: The Phantom Menace_, Queen Amidala reveals herself and kneels before Boss Nass to ask for his support. Everyone in her party follows suit. Nass being who he is, he first laughs and then agrees to help her.
-   _A Knight's Tale_ involves an interesting non-literally-kneeling variation where Edward, the Black Prince of Wales, surprises the crowd by throwing off his cloak, frees William from the stocks, and knights him in front of the crowd that was only moments earlier pelting William with rotten vegetables, all the while proclaiming that William is a man to be honored. Thus, the scene contains _both_ variations all at once.
-   _The Scorpion King_: The movie climaxes with an epic sword fight between Matthayus and Memnon, with a legion of Memnon's reinforcements approaching to wipe out the La Résistance supporting Matthayus. However the moment Matthayus kills Memnon, the remnants of Memnon's army kneels.
-   The Indian film _Magadheera_ has an iconic scene where the hero fights a hundred enemies, _alone_ to save his kingdom, and winning. Cue the invaders' Emperor, and the rest of the invading army, kneeling in submission.
-   _The Wizard of Oz_: "Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!"
-   In _The Last Airbender_, Aang describes to Katara and Sokka a ceremony where everyone bows to the new avatar as he takes on his new responsibilities. He was scared and ran away. After the battle at the north pole, everyone bows to him again, and while still scared, this time he accepts his role.
-   Max Manus is being decorated by the King of Norway after a successful mission. Max tells the King he's an inspiration to them all, but the King replies that actually Max is their inspiration.
-   _Ode to Gallantry_ has the scene where the protagonist, appearing to be a beggar and drifter, proving himself as the true successor of his clan. Cue the entire clan including the seniors kneeling.
-   In _Avengers: Endgame_, Tony Stark snaps with the Infinity Gauntlet to wipe out Thanos' forces and preserve the Avengers' victory in bringing back the half of the population that Thanos snapped away in _Infinity War_, but at the cost of his life. In a deleted scene, after his death, all of the Avengers kneel before Tony's lifeless body, starting with Clint and including T'Challa, Thor, and Captain America, who are respectively the King of Wakanda, the King of Asgard, and the leader of the Avengers.
-   Surprisingly Averted in the Disney Live-Action Remake of _Mulan_. The namesake character in this film is far more submissive than her animated counterpart. The original Mulan certainly does respect the Emperor, but this version of the character is the one who bows to the Emperor (all the way to the floor) and devotes herself to his protection to an extant that it comes across as Blind Obedience rather than being a Humble Hero. The most this version of the Emperor does in this film is acknowledge Mulan's role in saving his own life, but never bows in respect as in the original film. Considering that the original scene in the animated film was so iconic (it's the page image for a reason), many viewers were unhappy with this change.

    Literature 

-   _At Play in the Fields of the Lord_: The local Indians kneel before their messiah, the god Kisu, who happens to be the local Anti-Hero.
-   In the first book of _The Kane Chronicles_, Horus kneels to Carter and Sadie in gratitude, and all the other gods of Egypt follow along.
-   In J. R. R. Tolkien's _The Lord of the Rings_, Aragorn bows to Frodo (the very one this trope is named after) and Sam at Cormallen during the honoring of the Ring-bearers, and at their banquet, Frodo and Sam are seated above the kings and are waited upon by Merry and Pippin, who are both knights themselves. Aragorn also has Frodo and Gandalf bring him the crown as part of his coronation, to symbolize that it's only through Gandalf's wisdom and Frodo's courage that Aragorn _has_ a crown to wear or a kingdom to rule. However, Frodo and Sam consider themselves loyal subjects of the King.
-   _Magehunter_ ends with the titular Magehunter and his ally, Reinhardt of Margrave, teaming up to defeat the mage Mencius and returning to their home kingdom, just as war is about to break out. Reinhardt's timely arrival stops the battle, where everyone present quickly kneels before Reinhardt.
-   _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_: In the first book of the series, Percy is just the new guy at Camp Half-Blood. When the campers start up a game of Capture The Flag, most of the enemy team gang up on him since he's inexperienced. Percy stumbles into a nearby creek, and suddenly feels a surge of power, and fights them off, but is then set upon by a hellhound, who is quickly shot down by Percy's teammates. Poseidon then claims him as his son, which then causes everyone to kneel down in respect (grudging, from some).
    
    **Chiron:** Stormbringer. Earthshaker. Lord of Horses. Hail, Perseus Jackson, Son of the Sea God.
    
    -   And then in the final book, _The Last Olympian_, Percy gets an honor guard as he exits Olympus.
    -   In the sequel series _The Heroes of Olympus_, Piper gets the same treatment when she's claimed and blessed by her mother Aphrodite.
-   _Star Wars Legends_:
    -   In _Shatterpoint_, when Mace Windu rescues several prisoners, one of them kowtows to him, calling him "Your Highness" and begging for the lives of his children. Mace tells him to knock it off, as Jedi are servants to ordinary people, not the other way around.
    -   Near the end of the Novelization of _Revenge of the Sith_, Yoda (having failed to defeat Palpatine) has a dialogue with the ghost of Qui-Gon Jinn, during which he acknowledges that Qui-Gon was always the superior Jedi. When offered the chance to learn the secret of true immortality, Yoda bows before Qui-Gon and becomes his apprentice.
    -   In _Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor_, Group Captain Klick (one of the original clones from Kamino) and his men kneel when they see Luke — because they know him as Emperor Skywalker. (It Makes Sense in Context.)
-   Happens to the Lord Rahl in the _Sword of Truth_; it's called a Devotion. It doubles as a protection from Dream Walkers, if it's done earnestly. Also done at Devotion Squares in the People's Palace, symbolically to the Lord Rahl, when he isn't present. May also have some calming psychoactive effects when done for extended periods of time in those Devotion Squares. When Richard and Nathan Rahl switch off being the Lord Rahl so as to maintain the Bond that protects their people from Dream Walkers, this ensues repeatedly.
-   _Tortall Universe_: At the climax of _Trickster's Queen_, everyone in the Balitang house kneels before Dove, the prophesied queen.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Two instances of it on _Charmed (1998)_, when the "Frodo" is someone who is an acquaintance of the Charmed Sisters but they don't know that he's been promoted: An elf bows before Leo (when he has become a high-ranking Elder Whitelighter, but he hasn't told Piper about it yet. And several demons bow to Cole when he has become the Source of All Evil, but this is still a secret from Paige and the other Charmed Ones.

-   The _NCIS_ episode "Call of Silence" involves a retired Marine Corporal (i.e. an enlisted man) who earned the Medal of Honor in WWII. When two other Marines and a naval Lieutenant Commander (i.e. a commissioned officer) see him wearing his medal, they immediately stand at attention and salute.
-   _The Outpost_: In the Season 3 finale, the population of the outpost kneel to Talon as their new leader after Rosmund sacrifices herself to kill Yavalla.
-   In the ninth season of _Smallville_ Clark is subject to the second variety, ironically provoked by Major Zod.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: In the season 4 finale "Redemption: Part I", Picard gives Worf a sendoff as he leaves to fight in the Klingon Civil War with Starfleet officers lining the hallway leading to the transporter room, with Worf's fellow officers also present at the transporter room.
    -   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_: In the pilot episode "Emissary", Captain Picard personally gives Chief O'Brien a sendoff by beaming him to the station.
    -   In the _Short Trek_ episode "The Trouble with Edward", Captain Pike similarly beams the newly-promoted Captain Lucero from the _Enterprise_ to her first command, the research vessel _Cabot_.

    Myths & Religion 

-   The _Ramayana_: After the war against Ravana's forces is won and Sita is rescued, Rama calls his generals to his throne to receive reward for their bravery. However, when Hanuman walks towards the throne, Rama breaks into tears and tells him that no treasure in existence is valuable enough to reward Hanuman for his deeds.
-   This trope's appearance in the _Book of Esther_ chapter 6 makes this trope Older Than Feudalism. This case is an example of the second variety. The Evil Chancellor Haman is Hoist by His Own Petard -when asked by King Ahashuerus what to do to honor someone who has performed a service to the king, he thinks, "Who would the king wish to honor more than me!?" Turns out the king wishes to honor Mordechai the Jew, Haman's sworn enemy.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Legend of the Five Rings_, a subversion of this occurs which is a crucial event in the history of the Emerald Empire. Shiba, a kami and divine son of the Sun and Moon, revealed his true identity to the people of Gisei Toshi. Instead of them paying their respects to him, Shiba himself knelt before their leader Isawa. This show of humility procured their help in defending the fledgling empire.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: During the Great Crusade, the Word Bearers were making a lot less progress than the other legions in conquering worlds due to their habit of building temples to the Emperor and trying to enforce his worship. The Emperor, who hoped to destroy Chaos by removing any and all forms of religion from the galaxy, not only had their temples and monuments razed but forced the entire Legion to kneel before the Ultramarines. So when Lorgar heard about certain _other_ gods who welcomed prayer and worship, he didn't need telling twice and started off the events that would lead to the Horus Heresy, the Emperor becoming the God-Emperor very much against his will, and a good part of making 40K the happy fun place it's so well known to be.

    Video Games 

-   If the Chosen Undead of _Dark Souls_ chooses to let the Kiln of the First Flame go out, ending the Age of Gods, the Primordial Serpents show up to bow before the new Dark Lord.

-   _World of Warcraft_ has a removed quest where players who obtain the Corrupted Ashbringer can go to the Scarlet Monastery, and the previously hostile Scarlet Crusaders bow to them and offer their loyalty.

    -   At the conclusion of the Siege of Orgrimmar, every faction leader of the Horde bows to Vol'jin when they acknowledge he is now the Horde's leader.

    Western Animation 

-   Happens in _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ episode "The Avatar and The Fire Lord", when Roku is revealed to be the new Avatar, the entire hall of people bow down to him. Being the earthly personification of the in-universe's equivalent of god, this reaction is justified.
-   At the end of the first season of _The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes_, Thor, Crown Prince of Asgard, bows before the mortal Avengers in gratitude for saving him and all the gods. Odin and his join Thor in hailing the Avengers, a stark contrast from Odin's dismissal of Earth's importance in the beginning of the season.
-   In _The Hair Bear Bunch_ episode "Raffle Ruckus", Peevly kneels and kisses Hair Bear's hand, pleading him to find the missing zoo animals (which the bears arranged as part of a bargaining chip).
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   In the season 3 finale, the mane characters and Princess Celestia do this to Twilight Sparkle, who became an alicorn as a result of creating new magic and ascended to princesshood.
    -   Also, Luna gets this in the Nightmare Night episode. Occasionally happens to Celestia if she appears suddenly, such as in _Fall Weather Friends_.
    -   Also, everyone in the Crystal Empire does this to Cadence in the season 3 opener — activating the Crystal Heart in the process.
    -   In _Equestria Games_, when praising Spike for saving everypony and the Games, Princess Cadance prostrates herself before him so that her entire body and head are level with the baby dragon's shoulders, and addresses him in the custom of her subjects as Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious.
-   _Star Wars Rebels_: In "Heroes of Mandalore", when Bo-Katan Kryze accepts the Darksaber, and therefore the title of Mand'alor, and holds it up high, all the Mandalorians kneel before her.
-   In season Four of _Winx Club_, the other Earth Fairies kneel to Roxy in gratitude for freeing them.

    Real Life 

-   The usual rule in the US military is that the lower rank salutes the superior rank. An exception is made for anyone who had been awarded the Medal of Honor: _every_ serving member of the military is supposed to salute them first. Because the MoH is awarded for outstanding courage on the battlefield (not to mention it's most often awarded posthumously), it typically goes to enlisted men and/or quite junior officers — so occasionally a senior general might find himself saluting a second lieutenant or a corporal. The kicker? It's not an actual _rule_ that they do that for Medal of Honor recipients. It's just something they _do_.
    -   Similarly, the soldier on guard duty at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier never wears rank insignia, so as not to outrank those buried there.
    -   Since the Battle of Camerone, Mexican troops are reportedly required to salute French Foreign Legionnaires, regardless of relative rank.
-   At the memorial service for the 2004 Madrid train bombings, the King and Queen of Spain bowed to the audience.
-   Lakotah holy man Black Elk was a dancer in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show in 1887 when they toured England and Europe. They did a command performance for Queen Victoria, who said they were the "best-looking people" she had ever seen. A few weeks later, Vicky celebrated her Golden Jubilee, and the Indians had front row seats at the parade route, when this happened:
    
    When she came to where we were, her wagon stopped and she stood up. Then all those people stood up and roared and bowed to her; _but she bowed to us._
    
-   According to traditional protocol, the Emperor of Japan bows to no one. The only exception was when he visited the Yasukuni Shrine, dedicated to the soldiers and others who died fighting on behalf of the Emperor. (That is, until 1978: then-Emperor Hirohito/Showa stopped visiting it, most likely because of the _huge_ political controversies surrounding the enshrinement in Yasukuni of 14 persons who had been executed or imprisoned as war criminals in World War II.)
