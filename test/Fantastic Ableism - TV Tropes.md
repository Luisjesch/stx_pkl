Fantastic Racism is common in fiction when different groups hate each other, be it cats and dogs or elves and dwarves. However, what is also common is when members of the same group have a disability that limits their ability to function, which they are looked down upon even though said disability may not exist in real life. Frequently, characters part of superpowered groups or species may lack powers and effectively be regular people by real-world standards, but are nonetheless treated as lesser. Fictional societies where this trope is in play are often built around whatever the disabled characters have trouble with or don't have, making life unfairly rigged against them. A Muggle Born of Mages will often face this trope. Another common way for this trope to be done is an animal lacking the ability to do something what kind of animal they are is known to be able to do.

Of course, the ableism in question does not need to be merely hatred and mockery towards a disabled group, but it can also take the form of patronization or a belief that the disabled need to be protected.

To qualify for this trope, characters part of the discriminated group _must_ have a disability of some sort. Merely being bad at performing a task or lacking a talent is not enough. If they cannot do an action because they do not know how to do it, it also does not count. Furthermore, characters must be discriminated against in some fashion by other characters.

Having uncontrollable superpowers _may_ qualify as a disability, though it must be treated as a disability. The powers must interfere with a person's life in some way, and issues with them cannot be gotten rid of solely through positive thinking, training, etc.

Characters who are hybrids between species may count if their mixed heritage results in them being unable to do certain things that members within the groups they come from are expected to do and are looked down on by said members. Also, it still counts if the disabled character is assumed to be a part of a certain species even if it turns out later that they are not.

People with real-world disabilities being discriminated against in a fantasy setting do not count. However, animals or imaginary creatures with disabilities that exist in real life can qualify as this trope.

For characters being individually targeted and mistreated for their handicaps, All of the Other Reindeer is often in effect.

It's important to note that this trope only covers characters within the same group being treated badly for a disability. Characters from a different group or species being looked down upon is Fantastic Racism. Supertrope to Super Supremacist. Overlaps with Fictional Disability. Frequently has associated Fantastic Slurs.
