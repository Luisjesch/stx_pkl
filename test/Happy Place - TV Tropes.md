_"I know a place where no one's lost,  
I know a place where no one cries,  
Crying at all is not allowed,  
Not in my castle on a cloud."_

Sometimes the outside world can be a cold, cruel place, full of mean, hurtful people and scads of author-induced pain. That's why the best solution to a world bent on making you suffer can be to just curl up into a Troubled Fetal Position, suck your thumb, and go to a Happy Place inside your head. The Happy Place is rarely uninhabited though; it may be populated by scantily clad harem girls/boys, Spirit Advisors, an inner child or three, or if one is particularly unlucky they'll be roommates (headmates?) with a Split Personality, Superpowered Evil Side or Enemy Within. The troublesome roomies usually want to pick a fight.

A character interacting with others (or himself) in their Happy Place is a good way of giving them depth and explaining their motivation without having them act out of character in the show. The Stoic or The Quiet One who will never talk about the trauma that left them so may well relive it inside their mind, confronting a spectre of their guilt in the form of a dead loved one or other inner conflicts. In its extreme the dreamer may make a Journey to the Center of the Mind, sometimes accompanied by another.

Some characters are lucky and have their trip to the Happy Place happen outside of a show's real time, making their time and exposition there happen "instantly." A Cloud Cuckoo Lander is seldom so lucky. They may enter a fugue state or literally go catatonic while visiting their Happy Place, though this may sometimes be for the best if it's induced by emotional or physical trauma. Usually this depends on the nature of the Happy Place. Then again, the reason the Cloud Cuckoo Lander is so strange might be because they live _there_ and visit real life.

There is one significant danger to the Happy Place, that being that if the resident has been sufficiently abused in the real world they might choose not to go back despite realizing it's fake.

Kinds of Happy Place:

-   Inner Monologue, a safe place for the character to get on a soapbox.
-   All Just a Dream (a la Dorothy, in _The Wizard of Oz_ film adaptation).
-   Personal getaway and spa, ideal for escaping torture and stressful situations.
-   Sitting on the Roof
-   Madness Place: The hyper-productive creative fugue state of the Mad Scientist.

For some reason, the Happy Place is often a beach of some sort.

See also All Just a Dream, Convenient Coma, Dream Sequence, Arcadian Interlude, Ghost in the Machine, Journey to the Center of the Mind, Angst Coma, Contemplation Location, and Spirit Advisor. Compare with Cuckoo Nest, The Final Temptation, Happy Flashback and Lotus-Eater Machine. This is often how Heaven is represented. Contrast Black Bug Room, which is just the opposite of a Happy Place. See also Bad Mood Retreat for a literal happy place.

This is in fact Truth in Television and is a short term way that many people with anxiety use to slowly function in the world.

    Anime and Manga 

-   In _Chrono Crusade_, Rosette takes a distraught Azmaria out to a beautiful lake surrounded by forest to cheer her up. Chrono notes that it looks very similar to the area where he first met Rosette, and it seems as though she comes out there often when she's upset. In the middle of their trip there, a demon comes and attacks them, kidnapping Azmaria and setting the forest ablaze. Although it's only briefly shown, it's obvious that Rosette is shocked at seeing her personal Happy Place destroyed.
-   In _Shaman King_ Bokuto no Ryu is constantly on the hunt for his. He joins Yoh to help him in his fight against Hao after he finds out that his best place was on his side.
-   Lily's flashbacks in _Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force_ show that she created one for her to escape in during her time as a lab experiment. It was during this period, when she was trying to escape from her gruesome reality, that she started to lose both her voice and her memories.
-   On one episode of _Sailor Moon_, Lita is making okonomiyaki while obviously in a very bad mood. When her friends try to get her to talk about it she says "I am not angry! I am in my happy place!"
-   In _Full Metal Panic!_, Sosuke has a real-life Happy Place, revealed at the end of the third novel (or the first anime): It's a secluded corner of Mithril's island base where he can just kick back and do some fishing. It may be the only place in the world where the perpetually battle-ready Sosuke actually unwinds and has fun, and he brings Kaname there because he wanted to share it with her.
-   In the _Hinageshi_ arc of the _Higurashi: When They Cry_ manga, _the entire plot_ takes place in one of these, save for a little scene at the end. Tired and disappointed in herself because she failed a college prep test, a lonely Mion returns to Hinamizawa, her home. Hurt when her friends seem to have moved on without her (they don't make time to welcome her back, a ceremonial doll that represents her is gone from the group of dolls that symbolize them- It Makes Sense in Context\-) she gradually becomes more isolated and depressed, thinking that she doesn't have a place in Hinamizawa anymore. Suddenly, she wakes up in her own room, friends surrounding her. They explain that she's recovering from the effects of a bad fever, and tell her that they thought she was coming back a week later than she did, and that her doll was removed to be repainted. This makes Mion feel better, and she cries Tears of Joy, and everyone is happy. And _then_ the manga switches to showing a comatose Mion, propped up in a hospital bed. For the first time since she fell into the coma, a doctor comments, Mion shows signs of life- she's crying, but still doesn't wake up. It's then that the reader learns this arc is actually a sequel to one in which the Hinamizawa Disaster occurred. This means that Mion was the only survivor of her village being _annihilated,_ and, because she couldn't cope with the pain, stayed permanently in her happy place- her dreams. It actually gets even sadder when one realizes the metaphor: Mion starts said arc bitterly disappointed at her failure, and wants more than anything her friends to tell her that they forgive said failure. Does this means she blames _herself_ for the Disaster occurring?

Nagito eventually confronts World Destroyer and attempts to kill both the AI and himself, knowing he could never possibly win. This allows him to remember reality, and World Destroyer explains the the dream was a reflection of Nagito's feelings and desires, which he finds embarrassing and dismisses before waking up in the real world.

    _"Slide."_
    
-   In _Happy Gilmore_, Happy's mentor encourages him to find his Happy Place in order to curb his anger and improve his golf game; said Happy Place consists of his grandmother being wealthy and his girlfriend wearing slinky lingerie and holding a mug of beer in each hand.

-   The most infamous scene in the movie _Show Dogs_ has the protagonist Max, a dog, having to endure a genital inspection prior to be accepted into a dog show. He remembers the advice of a different dog who repeats that he has to go to his "happy place", and so fantasizes about a musical scene that parodies _Dirty Dancing_.
-   _Sucker Punch_ is an especially confusing example- it shifts between at least three levels of reality, and in two of them- you know the badass group of Action Girls who've been following our protagonist and helping her fight her fears and grow stronger? Yeah, they're actually figments of her imagination. A blog entry tries to explain the madness, but even so, the film remains confusing- it's either a disgustingly misogynistic 'popcorn movie' that combined an incomprehensible plot with masses of fanservice, or a serious movie about a girl overcoming the trauma of sexual abuse to free herself from an insane asylum that mocks the very people who watch it for the fanservice. There are arguments to be made for both sides, and neither can really explain why the film has that dragon-slaying scene- though that likely falls under symbolism and Rule of Cool.
-   _Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead_ has "Boat Dreams", when you imagine you're on a boat with your friends, beautiful women, drinks etc. Especially useful when the Mafia is torturing you to death.

    Literature 

-   In _Dragon Bones_, Ward's happy place is his home, castle Hurog. He visits it when his brother Tosten is tortured to make Ward talk. Also, his mother's garden, but that's part of the castle. It is the only place where his mother is sober and normal, as it is his memory of her, not her actual self, that talks to him.
-   In the Tamora Pierce _Circle of Magic_ books, Briar creates a magical Happy Place for himself and his foster-sisters; the mental place in question is of the Sitting on the Roof category, and is the place where the four first solidified their friendship as children. It acts as an extension of their returned telepathy.
-   In the book version of _The Princess Bride_, Westley endures torture by imagining himself with Buttercup. However, this only works until Count Rugen brings in The Machine.
-   Hannibal Lecter built an entire Happy Palace, filled with his memories of culture and fine arts. He used it to endure his time in prison, and on long airline rides.
-   In the Stephen King\-as-Richard-Bachman book _The Regulators_, autistic and telepathic Seth manages to create such a refuge for his aunt/guardian Audrey (using a vacation she took in her college days as source material) to give her a way to get away from Tak's various torments.
    -   And in _The Dark Tower_, Sheemie Ruiz, a powerful but mentally-disabled psychic, can create a _physical_ happy place with his mind, and sends the protagonists there to protect them.
-   In one of the _Animorphs_ books, Taylor tortures Tobias by deliberately putting him in his happy place, then switching to unbearable pain, then back, and forth, and so on. This kept him from using his anti-emotion (including pain) mechanism.

-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire,_ Jaime and Brienne are captured by a gang of bandits. Jaime advises Brienne to go into her happy place when they try to rape her, instead of fighting back; attacking them will only make them angrier and likely to mutilate or kill her. Brienne, being a very staunch Action Girl, refuses the idea, and later Jaime is able to think up an idea that will keep the bandits from raping her at all...though it's a near miss.
    -   We later find out why Jaime advised this in particular. In his youth, Jaime was a knight sworn to protect a very insane, sadistic king. In particular, he was Forced to Watch while said king killed innocent people in horrific ways, and could not reconcile his honour (which demanded he serve the king faithfully) with his conscience. Thus, he used this trope frequently (the thing he visualized, in particular, was being safe and happy with Cersei, his lover.) However, when the king announced his intention to _burn everyone in the capital city to death,_ just to spite those coming to conquer it, Jaime was so completely horrified that he could not stand by. That's why he's known as the Kingslayer when the books begin, and reviled as a traitor without honour. He comments later to Brienne on the irony of being despised by so many for his finest act, _especially_ as it was Ned Stark, the exemplar of Honor Before Reason, that assumed the worst of Jaime when he came upon the scene.
-   Patricia Anne of the _Southern Sisters Mysteries_ reacts to finding dead bodies by mentally wandering the linen aisle of whatever store is having a sale that week, envisioning what kind of towels and throw pillows she's going to buy.
-   Merricat Blackwood in _We Have Always Lived in the Castle_ utilizes this when doing the week's shopping, treated like a pariah by the villagers, including kids throwing rocks at her; she shuts them out and begins to imagine she's living in a little blue house on the moon. She elaborates on this pleasant life all through the book, especially whenever she is anxious or afraid.
-   _Eden Green_ follows a rationalist young woman battling the needle monsters invading her city. As she recovers from a bad injury, she goes to her happy place: A quiet, isolated deer stand she visited years ago. Later, as her adventures begin to wear down her sanity, she mentally returns to the deer stand with increasing desperation.
-   The mind palaces in _The Traitor Son Cycle_ work like this. Every sorcerer has a mind palace, where they store memories and spells, and it's usually modelled after a place the sorcerer feels the most comfortable. Inside, the time passes more slowly than in real world, so on many occasions, people use them to pause, catch a breath and calm their nerves, or simply escape from reality for a moment.
-   _A Boy Made of Blocks_: During a camping trip, Sam gets scared when night falls. Alex tells him to close his eyes and pretend he's in _Minecraft_, and the two describe the imaginary landscape they explore to each other.

In _Do You Know Me?_ Skye, who is secretly afraid of heights, freezes up on a climbing course in the trees. Tally, trying to think of the opposite of her own happy place, tells Skye to imagine being in a cave or a dark cellar, which only freaks her out even more.
-   Ginny from _The Kitchen Daughter_ calms herself by imagining that she's cooking or eating food. The more stressed she is, the more elaborate the imagined meal is.
-   Hannibal from _Twelve Days_ imagines himself in "the Game," a giant house that doubles as a Memory Palace. Each wing has ten stories, each story has ten corridors, each corridor has ten rooms, each room contains ten objects, and each object has ten hooks, on which Hannibal hangs his memories. Hannibal loves being in the Game, where he's safe and alone, but never bored. In the real world, he spends most of his time attempting to draw the house, then either erasing it or crossing it out when he's done.
-   _The Witch of Knightcharm_: Elea Korhonen is a rookie witch trapped in an evil Wizarding School. After she arrives and sees a few of the horrors, including another witch getting slaughtered in a Wizard Duel for being insubordinate to an older student, Elea snaps and retreats to what's described as a 'mental fortress of solitude.' She's still physically present in a dangerous and twisted school, but in her mind she's somewhere safe and pleasant.
-   Kieran of _The Dark Artifices_ apparently used this to deal with beatings and torment during his time in the Wild Hunt, using his brother's cottage as a focus.

    -   Although we don't see it, Stark retreats to such a place when he's being tortured in the Aurora Chair by Scorpius. It's the one memory he won't let Scorpius have, and he ends up sharing it with Crichton when he too is put in the Chair.
-   _Titus_, of the eponymous comedy show, had a black and white room from where he'd have an Inner Monologue to tell the audience.

-   One episode of _The 4400_ has Tom having a hallucination of a happy life that lasts eight years from his perspective but occurs over a few seconds of real time.

It also nearly kills Diana when she choses to stay in the Happy Place rather than coming back to reality.
-   An odd variant appears in _The Drew Carey Show_, where Lewis has both a Happy Place (that he goes to) and a Happy _Spot_ (the stroking or scratching of which can send him to his Happy Place).
-   In an episode of the fourth season of _Coupling_, one of the characters accompanies her friend to antenatal classes and disappears to her Happy Place (complete with wine and a string quartet) when the actual mechanics of childbirth get discussed.

-   _Supernatural_
    -   The Djinn in "What Is and What Should Never Be" sends its victims here while he feeds on their blood. Highly disturbingly, Dean's happy place is where he can "rest", his father's still dead (yet still having the amazing ability to be able to bully him from beyond the grave) because a happy John would probably make his brain short-out, his perfect girlfriend looks the reaper from the season premiere, everyone thinks he's a worthless waste of space (because he's the one who thinks that) and his family all have wonderful lives except him. And the worst thing? He genuinely thinks that "It's still better than anything he has, especially since his mother and Sam are happy."
    -   Heaven, for human souls, is a mental world where they re-live their happiest memories, and even in Heaven Dean's life is pain.

He then visits Sam's version of Heaven, which is made up of memories where Sam escaped his family, including Dean.

-   Part of season 3 of _My Name Is Earl_ has Earl in a coma dreaming of being a character in a pleasant family sitcom called "The Hickeys", complete with many typical sitcom tropes including Laugh Track. It's revealed that the reason his subconscious created a Dom Com like that was because when he was a child, he would turn his attention to the TV when his parents would fight, and he wished he lived in a "perfect" home like the ones on TV.
-   Given a _beautiful_ double-subversion in _Burn Notice_, with borderline Ax-Crazy Action Girl Fiona, and the reason it's a double-subversion is because before Michael tells her to stop it, Tricia (who had her son kidnapped and is desperate to get him back) _is_ visibly relaxing with a much too peaceful smile:
    
    **Fiona:** Tricia, I want you to try something. It's a relaxation exercise I do in situations like this. I want you to close your eyes, and breathe deep... picture a peaceful mountain stream... picture yourself drowning the kidnapper in the stream. You're taking a rock from the stream, and raising it above your head, and with tremendous force you're bringing—

    -   A straighter example is in the fourth season premiere, in which Britta instructs Abed to make a happy place to help him cope with the change going on his life. The result is "Abed's Happy Community College Show," a cliche and stagnant Sitcom reality, complete with Laugh Track. When change begins to seep into Abed's imagined world, he retreats even further into "Greendale Babies."
-   In _As the World Turns_, Luke helps the claustrophobic neurosurgeon Reid calm down while they are stuck in an elevator by telling to go to his happy place. Reid's happy place is the brain, as he is very fascinated by brains,
-   In season 2 of _Hannibal_, Will Graham spends a lot of time imagining himself fishing in an idyllic river. He has to do _something_ to keep calm while he's stuck in a mental institution awaiting trial for murder. Nasty bits of the outside world do occasionally break in, though: bloated dead bodies floating past him, the Ravenstag walking on the riverbank, and the Wendigo rising from the water to stare hungrily at him, to name a few.
-   In _Brooklyn Nine-Nine,_ when Boyle and Terry find out that Diaz's aggressive attitude at the witness stand is due to her nervousness, they instruct her to find her "happy place" while testifying. It turns out that Diaz's happy place is a bit more violent than the conventional kind.

-   On _Raising Hope_, Burt pictures himself on an island where he's rich because he's the only one who knows how to clean the ocean, his favorite food grows on trees, there's a friendly native (named Pupukaka) who he always beats at foozball, and an entire harem of beautiful women (all of whom are his wife, Virginia.)
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_: The Guiding Tree of the Great Forest, which is part of the Talaxian afterlife which Neelix tells Naomi Wildman before she goes to bed in the episode "Mortal Coil", becomes this for Naomi at the end of the episode.
-   _Person of Interest_: In "6,741", Sameen Shaw mentions that her trainers instructed agents under torture to "take their mind somewhere else. Someplace safe."
    
    **Root:** Where did you go?  
    **Shaw:** Nowhere. The training was bull. There was no safe place. No escape.
    
    -   However, at the end of the episode, she confesses to Root that there _was_ a place she went to:
-   This is a common interpretation of Wonderland in _Adventures in Wonderland_. The series formula is that Alice has some kind of a moral conundrum or thinking about her homework. She then enters Wonderland, where the residents are in a similar situation - and after it is "solved", she returns and mentions she was thinking about it. This fits in with some common interpretations of _Alice In Wonderland_ as well.
-   In the _Broad City_ episode "The Matrix," Abbi is trapped in a hole in the ground with an injured ankle. She smokes weed and imagines going on dates with various celebrities.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_ features this trope in the episode "A Stop at Willoughby", in which a severely depressed ad executive dreams of getting off the train at a charming town from the 1800s called Willoughby, but something always wakes him from his dream before he gets off the train. By the end of the episode, he gets off and is able to reach his happy place, but in the real world, it is revealed that he jumped out the window of the train and committed suicide.
-   _The Punisher (2017)_: When Frank Castle is being tortured in "Home", he sustains his morale by imagining himself making love to his wife. This leads to a rather disturbing Interplay of Sex and Violence as his torturer is getting a lot of pleasure beating Castle to a bloody mess.
-   _Friends_: Monica suffers from a bout of insomnia after breaking up with Richard so Phoebe offers to help her with some meditative techniques. She tells Monica to picture herself in her happy place but Monica's version of that is Richard's living room. As this defeats the purpose of what they're doing Phoebe offers to "lend" Monica her own happy place: a meadow under a starry sky with waterfalls and fountains. This doesn't work either as the water imagery makes Monica need the bathroom.

    Music 

-   The Beach Boys' "In My Room".
    
    In this world I lock out  
    All my worries and my fears  
    In my room  
    In my room
    
-   Evanescence's song "Imaginary" describes one of these places. The lyrics talk about a "field of paper flowers and candy clouds of lullaby" that the singer escapes to because her life is "the nightmare I built my own world to escape".
-   Paul McCartney referred to "Yellow Submarine" as this.
-   In David Byrne's "Back in the Box", the narrator keeps going back into his box because he can't deal with the outside world.
    
    And now love's terrifying.  
    I cannot hide what I want.  
    You cannot hear me or see me  
    when I go back in the box.
    
-   Poets of the Fall has used the concept more than once.
-   _Vocaloid_: Deconstructed in _Dreaming Beats_ by Chuna. GUMI plays a girl who has vivid fantasies about being a powerful military general and a Messiah who promises to save a famished land, but all of it is little more than a maladaptive coping mechanism, as she believes she's been through so much pain and trauma that she's no longer fit to live in the real world. She gets so engrossed in her dreams that she refuses to wake up and eventually ends up in a coma.

    Radio 

-   The radio version of _Little Britain_ has a recurring sketch of a masseur who attempts to relax a very uptight client with various, horrifically inappropriate, methods, including a whale music CD which ends with the whales being slaughtered. In one episode, the masseur suggests thinking happy thoughts, though his idea of 'happy' involves a weeping old man being pushed down a hill in a wheelie bin by stone-throwing children.

    Theatre 

-   Harper from _Angels in America_ has a great many (Valium-induced) hallucinations that fill this purpose.

    Video Games 

-   _Xenogears_' lead Fei not only has several Split Personalities, but several hang out in their own Happy Place apart from each other and Fei. Poor guy's head must feel like a condo.
    -   Fei's MPD was a coping mechanism that young Fei's developed to deal with the painful experiments that his own mother (who was Not Herself, long story) put him through. Young Fei created a second personality (named Id, who calls the original "the coward") to bear the brunt of the trauma while the original personality retreated to a literal Happy place; a vault that contained all the happy memories that he had ever experienced. The inversion of this Trope also applies to Id, who's stuck in land containing nothing but the "unhappy" memories, due to the presence of a _3rd_ personality (the current Fei) that was created to contain the psychotic Id.
-   The entire plot of Kagetsu Tohya is based on how Shiki comes to realize that he's trapped in Len's version of a Lotus-Eater Machine, which is really more of what he would consider this trope. All she really wants is a normal, happy every day life. While inside, he's always fairly happy while staying in the bounds of Len's script. He doesn't have to fight vampires, he can be with all his friends and love interests, it's always exciting and hey, maybe there's a festival going on! But that's Len's happy place, and she's a dream familiar that dragged him with her while thinking she was helping him after Arcueid knocked him out on accident.
-   In the second large DLC for _The Witcher 3_, "Blood and Wine," the Duchess Anna Henrietta has a _physical_ happy place, a land of fairy tales and what not, that a sorcerer had made for her and her sister as a pocket dimension to play in when they were children. Though in the intervening years of their absence, the magic had started to wear thin, and stuff started getting a little warped. Rapunzel losing hope of ever being rescued, hanging herself with her own hair, then becoming a wraith that attacks Gerlat when he shows up. The Little Matchstick Girl gettign desperate and moving from selling matchsticks to selling fisstech. That sort of thing. Though the place later comes in handy when the Duchess needs to hide her sister from a mentally unstable High Vampire who wants her dead and simultaneously imprison her while they figure out what to do about the sister manipulating that vampire into killing knights she justifiably had a grudge against.
-   In _Project Origin_, one of the recurring visions Becket keeps experiencing from Alma is of a hilltop amidst tall, waving grass with a single swingset hanging from the tree. The significance of this scene doesn't become apparent until the end of the game, when you reach Still Island. The tree and the swingset _were_ real, but sandwiched into a muddy corner of the nuclear power plant's sewer system, and the place you ended up visiting is what she kept trying to imagine it as: the only Happy Place she had amidst all the experimentation and misery she experienced as a child.
-   In _Rayman 2: The Great Escape_, there is an odd alternate ending in the middle of the game. After beating a level called The Cave of Bad Dreams (actually the Black Bug Room of the god of that world), Rayman can choose whether or not to accept a huge pile of gold he does not need. If he does take it, the game ends on a shot of Rayman, very fat and happy, relaxing on a tiny tropical island, with the entire world around him in ruins. However, The Cave of Bad Dreams is a large Schrödinger's Butterfly, so it can't be known if the island is real or not.
-   _Rise Of Insanity_ is a horror game where you're a mental patient trapped in an abandoned, empty Bedlam House. There's a segment, however, where after your mind caved in, you suddenly find yourself in a greenhouse full of flowers, a beautiful outdoor park with plenty of trees, a peaceful lake with a rowboat, and a tunnel made of _marshmallows_ while calm, serenating violin music plays in the background. And then you wake up and you're back in your cell.
-   Subverted. Wonderland used to be this, in _American McGee's Alice_.
    -   Also subverted in the sequel, _Alice: Madness Returns_. Wonderland initially looks like it will be a happy place for Alice, and that her therapy has paid off, but things go wrong soon after she arrives.

    Web Original 

-   This infamous Creepypasta story turns this trope into high-octane Paranoia Fuel.
    
    It has been reported that some victims of violence, during the act, would retreat into a fantasy world from which they could not WAKE UP. In this catatonic state, the victim lived in a world just like their normal one, except they weren't being raped. The only way that they realized they needed to WAKE UP was a note they found in their fantasy world. It would tell them about their condition, and tell them to WAKE UP. Even then, it would often take months until they were ready to discard their fantasy world and PLEASE WAKE UP.

"Whoa. That _can't_ be good." As the pilot was never picked up, nothing ever really came of this.
-   In the second _Robot Chicken_ _Star Wars_ special, going into this was how Anakin was able to bring himself to kill the Jedi children — retreating into his memory of Naboo, where he and Padme fell in love.

    Real Life 

-   Going to your "happy place," or taking a mental vacation, is a recommended coping strategy for people with a variety of mental conditions (anxiety, depression, bipolar, borderline personality disorder, etc.) to deal with stressful situations, so long as these trips remain _short term._ If a person begins spending a significant portion of his or her time away from reality (this is called maladaptive daydreaming), it may be time to use other coping methods more often.
-   Autistic fantasy is a form of withdrawal into the mental world to avoid dealing with real people and situations. Despite the name, it is not restricted to those on the autism spectrum; individuals with personality disorders may also use this as an (unhealthy/lower level) coping strategy. Rather than a mental vacation, those who live these fantasies substitute the mental world for the real one and avoid taking actions that might resolve their problems.
-   Some autistic people have healthier variants. Some have a _task,_ like writing or drawing, that acts as their 'happy place,' where they can be undisturbed and work out their emotions. Others don't retreat into imagination at all, but just need to cool down in a quiet, private place.
