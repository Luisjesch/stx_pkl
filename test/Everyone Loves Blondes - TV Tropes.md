_"Never shall a young man,  
Thrown into despair  
By those great honey-coloured  
Ramparts at your ear,  
Love you for yourself alone  
And not your yellow hair."_

When there's one character who is meant to stand out because she's the most desirable, she's pretty much always going to be a blonde. She may be Book Dumb, but she is never ditzy or foolish if intelligence is even an issue. She might be attractive in her opinion but, more likely, it's everyone else who considers her exotic. If there's a group of girls, then all the guys will want the blonde. She may be the school's Prom Queen. She is the blonde whose seemingly effortless romantic abilities we see or hear about so much that she always seems to get her man, at least at first. She may blur the line between innocent and evil in her social goals. If a man's having an affair, she's the one he's doing it with. Not that she's trying to steal him away - she wants to be happy and it's just convenient that he finds her irresistible.

Many men have the type of being attracted to many fair haired women, especially if they have long legs and big breasts, but the lovable blonde herself is the kind of person who can attract anyone she wants and she probably knows it. No matter what his type normally is, he'll fall for her.

Whether it's a single person informing us of her attractiveness or all the guys wanting her, all anyone can say about her is that she's gorgeous, sexy, or beautiful, as if that's all there is to her. She may be actively charming, athletic, rich, or even smart, but her sex appeal is considered her biggest asset. Expect her to be energetic but not necessarily to the extent of the Genki Girl. One thing's for sure: the lovable blonde is no Girl Next Door. Often times she's a foil to a dark-haired character who is less glamorous and popular.

In Real Life blonde hair is fairly unusual. It's a recessive trait that radiates out from north-west Europe and even there most people aren't blonde. Blonde hair is also found in Melanesian people, from a different gene than the one found in Europe, though again, it's a recessive trait. It would be unusual for someone who doesn't have at least some Northern European ancestry on both sides to be a naturally light-skinned blonde or for someone who doesn't have at least some Melanesian ancestry on both sides to be a naturally dark-skinned blonde.

Compare the sexuality of the Brainless Beauty. Also compare Raven Hair, Ivory Skin and Redheads Are Ravishing. Contrast helpless, scatter-brained Dumb Blonde. Can be Plenty of Blondes. And of course, even Slashers Prefer Blondes.

    Advertising 

-   1960s ads for Lady Clairol hair dye included such taglines as "Is it true... blondes have more fun?" and "If I've only one life... let me live it as a blonde!".

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Berserk_, actually pretty heavily averted the main woman of the series: Casca is a dark haired (previous short) and brown skinned.
    -   The female Apostle uses her blonde haired-naked woman form to lure men to their deaths. She’s also the only other female character beside Casca to have sex with Guts, even if was just for the latter to kill the former.
    -   Played straight with Farnese who comes from noble birth but manages to become a good person after her Heel–Face Turn, and while she isn’t quite as attractive as Casca she’s still the second most important female character.
    -   Subverted with Nina she’s got nice hair and a good bod, but her Dirty Coward nature throws her into The Scrappy\-status for a lot of the fanbase.
-   Rangiku Matsumoto from _Bleach_ has golden blonde<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and is quite famous throughout Soul Society for her curvaceous figure. Shuhei Hisagi has a crush on her.
-   Richard from _The Case Files of Jeweler Richard_ is blue-eyed, blond, and gorgeous enough to stop traffic. Almost _everyone_ spends their time in his presence Eating the Eye Candy.

-   Teresa from _Claymore_, but just about everyone in this show is blonde, but as a Lady of War, Teresa is a standout.
-   Misa Amane from _Death Note_ a subversion; while she's a teenage knockout, Light isn't interested in sex with her only as a pawn to further his twisted goals. Misa also dyes her hair blonde.
-   _Dragon Ball_ franchise:
    -   _Dragon Ball_:
        -   Launch in her "bad blonde" side, which many would argue<small>◊</small> is even hotter than her blue-haired docile side; how Tien could ever run from that bombshell is something we'll never know.
        -   Bulma’s mother Panchy (yes that’s her real name) is blonde and as attractive as her daughter.
        -   Husky from the anime, the blonde Femme Fatale Spy.
    -   _Dragon Ball Z_:
        -   Android 18, no lessened by the fact she's a Cyborg (who can still bear children) had poor Krillin throwing everything away to save her, though can't say we blame him. Her daughter Marron is looker in GT too.
        -   Erasa from Gohan’s high school is a blonde sweetheart and unlike Videl was drooling over him from the get go, unfortunately for her subverted as like his dad Gohan has a type.

-   Caulifla and Kale from _Dragon Ball Super_ count as they can go Super Saiyan too (as if they weren’t sexy enough).

-   Lucy Heartfilia from _Fairy Tail_ for plenty of... reasons.
-   Saber from _Fate/stay night_ real hot Lady of War with Super-Reflexes to boot.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Riza Hawkeye is attractive, supportive, and handy with nine milometer pistols. Winry Rockbell even more as a loving child hood sweet heart enough to win the heart of main protagonist Edward Elric. There's also Olivier Mira Armstrong and her younger sister Catherine.
    -   There's also the main protagonist and his brother (when he wasn't stuck in suit of amour). Jeez this show has more blondes than Germany... oh wait.

-   Seras Victoria from _Hellsing_: beautiful when she was a human and now eternally attractive as a vampire (even when covered in blood) and the sexy British accent certainly helps.
    -   Integra is looker as well, hell the main females series are both blonde and beautiful.
-   In _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_, there are two notable blondes, and they are both total knockouts:
    -   Miu, the Deuteragonist and Love Interest to The Hero Kenichi. She's so pretty with her blonde hair and amazing figure that she spends the first half of the manga dressing in a way to conceal her appearance to avoid unwanted attention at school. She eventually learns to just accept it and stops hiding her appearance.
    -   On the opposite end is the Lucha Libre Rachel, who thrives on getting as much attention as possible.

-   _Naruto_:
-   Nancy Lee from _Ninja Slayer_ gets eyed upon by practically every male she encounters. Alas, in the show's setting of Neo Saitama, you do NOT want to be the center of attention.

-   _One Piece_, surprisingly averted as the two main females are a gorgeous ginger and dark haired hottie. The amount of attractive blonde girls despite the large cast is surprisingly small. Here’s the most notable ones:
    -   Kaya though she starts off as a Delicate and Sickly girl and slightly spoiled, is still beautiful enough to give Lovable Coward Usopp incentive to go running back home, hell she has six suitors trying to put a ring on her. She's also a doctor in training so can she patch up Usopp's injuries when he inevitably comes home... lucky bastard.
    -   Miss Valentine though she is downright psychotic is still very attractive and with her weight powers she can literally crush you with her ass.
    -   Conis from Skypeia... and being a literal angel helps.
    -   Kalifa from CP9 though her hair ranges towards more strawberry blonde she still manages to be The Ditz and a Femme Fatale Spy at the same time. Kalifa also gave Nami one of her toughest Designated Girl Fights in the series.
    -   Victoria Cindry manages to be this despite being a walking corpse. When she was alive Cindry was pretty much One Piece's Marilyn Monroe being a beautiful blonde actress who died tragically.
    -   Domino from Impel Down, though she's got some Nazi-vibes and is always wearing shades but certainly livens up that prison.
    -   Marguerite from Amazon Lily and if you can stand out in a island full of super babes, you're damn special.
    -   The late Queen Otohime of Fishmen Island, petty much the definition of Hair of Gold, Heart of Gold.
    -   Carrot from the Zou, a white Bunny-lady with blonde hair, she is very adorable and is surprisingly strong.
    -   Vinsmoke Sora Sanji’s mom sure she’s bedridden but that doesn’t make Sora any less attractive or the fact she’s the reason her third son has natural blonde hair, good looks and humanity.
    -   Stussy the blonde underworld boss of the “pleasure district”. It also turns out she works for CP0 and can kill a man with her pinky, but anything that makes her hotter.
    -   While female blondes are few and far between in One Piece, attractive male blondes are all over the place. Here’s<small>◊</small> the main ones.
-   _One-Punch Man_, no real female examples, but Genos is a In-Universe example being dubbed the “blonde Cyborg” and winning the public’s heart. While his friend and Foil Saitama is looked down upon for being a bald weirdo, regardless of how strong he is.
-   Carol from _Ouke no Monshou_ is blonde-haired, blue-eyed American girl dragged back in time to ancient Egypt. Of course, most of them have never even seen anyone with that hair color before, so she attracts a LOT of attention.
-   Panty Anarchy from _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ is fawned upon a lot of men (and gets laid a lot, too).

-   Kiyoh Bachika from _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ one Kittan’s younger sisters and despite being just a supportive character, she rivals Yoko for the Ms. Fanservice title. Especially early on in the series.
    -   Technically Nia counts as well though she’s blue-blonde, regardless she becomes attractive enough for Simon to turn his head (away from Yoko).

-   _Trigun_:
    -   Vash The Stampede himself counts, he’s quite the Hunk if you can look past all the scars, the missing limb and fact he’s not human. Vash is also a truly inspiring Hair of Gold, Heart of Gold, being a Badass Pacifist who draws good people towards him.
        -   Subverted with his brother Knives though no less attractive than Vash, he lacks any of aforementioned morals.
    -   The most notable female example isn’t even a canon one, but Marianne from episode 2 certainly fits this trope. Vash was particularly enamoured to point where he tried to spy on her and heartbroken to discover she was an undercover cop. Ironic since Marianne falls for him by the end of the episode.

-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Mai Valentine is a gorgeous blonde who has drawn the attention and devotion of no less than three male characters in the series.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_: Like the aforementioned Mai, Alexis Rhodes is blonde and has a number of admirers.

-   _Fables_:
    -   Cinderella par for the course, but instead of cleaning she works as a super spy, since Prince Charming turned out to be a massive asshole. Cindy really does kick some serious ass in her own comic-line and even kills the powerful witch fables Frau Totenkinder **with her slipper**.
    -   Oda Harp form _Fables Werewolves of the Heartland_, the beautiful daughter of Sergeant Harp (Bigby's old war buddy). Oda was meant to go and seduce Bigby and unite him the Story City as their "wolf messiah" and very nearly succeeded- but failed due to Bigby being loyal to Snow (his wife).

Starbuck laments that they managed to find the only place in the universe where blondes _don't_ have more fun.
-   In _The Many Dates of Danny Fenton_, two of Danny's dates that he actually gets along with well and learn his secret identity are Sabrina Spellman (specifically the one from _Sabrina's Secret Life_) and Supergirl, both blonde.

She's also cynically aware that she'll get handed lots of things such as college scholarships purely because of her beauty rather than any merit of her own.
-   It's been referenced several times on _Heroes_ that Nathan Petrelli likes blondes. His ex-girlfriends Meredith and Tracy are both blonde and he had a brief affair with Tracy's long-lost identical sister Niki.
-   _House of Saddam_: Subverted. Saddam gains the blonde Samira as his new mistress, so his brunette wife Sajida dyes her hair blonde as well to be noticed by Saddam. He simply dismisses it as "tacky", implying that it's Samira's youtfulness more than anything that he really appreciates.
-   In _Kyle XY_, Hillary is the blonde with whom Charlie cheats on his virginal girlfriend, who, interestingly enough, is also blonde. For the rest of the characters, it is not as good to not be a blonde like Lorie, who's gloomy, and Jessie, who's angry, vs. the good Nicole and Amanda. Gamer Andy, with her dark golden locks, is neutral.
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: Galadriel is the only light-blond person in the setting, and a lot of characters are awestruck by the sight of her. Even Sauron briefly has the hots for her.
-   _Mission: Impossible_ has Cinnamon Carter, played by Barbara Bain. Her talent for distracting the mark was pretty much her reason for being on the team. See also her Suspiciously Similar Substitute Casey in the final two seasons and Mimi in the episodes where she subbed for Casey. (Interestingly enough, averted in the Revival - with both Casey Randall and Shannon Reed being brunette.)
-   _In Plain Sight_: Mary and Rafe's wife tease him about his type: blonde, with boobs.
-   Aunt Hilda in _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_. While she fits the trope most, both Sabrina and Zelda are shown to be popular and fun loving as well.
-   _Schitt's Creek_: Alexis Rose is blond, vivacious and portrayed as very popular with most men. In fact, she tells her brother that if a man doesn't ask for her phone number, he's either newly married or he's gay.
-   Dr Molly Clock from _Scrubs_ - blonde and attracts most of the hospital.
-   Invoked in the _Shadowhunters_ episode "The Mortal Cup". Isabelle wears a platinum blonde wig while hunting the demon because they apparently like blondes more.
-   _The Vampire Diaries_:
    -   On the female side of this trope, we have Caroline Forbes and Rebekah Mikaelson. Both are blonde vampires and both have had a sizable number of lovers and people who have found them attractive. In Caroline's case she has been paired with Matt, Stefan, Tyler, Alaric, a minor character named Jesse and Klaus, giving her the largest amount of relationships in the entire series. Rebekah has also been with both Stefan and Matt and on _The Originals_ is desired by semi-antagonist and ally Marcel Gerard who is stated to have a thing for blondes stemming from his attraction to Rebekah.
    -   On the male side we have the aforementioned Stefan Salvatore and Matt Donovan. Both have dated Caroline, Rebekah and Elena. Stefan was also in a relationship with Katherine who still carries a torch for him and has also expressed attraction to Matt at least twice.
-   _Veronica Mars_: During one episode Veronica searches a teenage boy's apartment after he invited her in but instead finds a Porn Stash with nothing but blondes.

    Music 

-   "I Like Blondes" by Jameson Clark.
-   "Love Blonde" by Kim Wilde. (She explicitly denied the song is autobiographic!)
-   The song "Blondes (Have More Fun)" by Rod Stewart.
-   Subverted in "Brunettes (Do It Better)" by KIDFORCE:

    Pinball 

-   In WhizBang Pinball's _Whoa Nellie! Big Juicy Melons_, the three Mellon sisters are the blonde Melony, the medium-tan Hellen, and the near-black Ellen — yet the only one featured on the backglass, promotional materials, and The Merch is blonde Melony.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Madusa was an early version of this in her WWE persona 'Alundra Blayze'. Presented as a lovable, wholesome All-American Face and playing the 'beauty' in WWE's first Beauty vs Beast feud. She even got breast implants and a nose job while in the company.
-   The Beautiful People - presented as The Beautiful Elite of TNA - had each member as a blonde. Notably when the stable split, Madison Rayne became a brunette.
-   Debra Marshall was a sexy blonde in the Attitude Era who was responsible for coining the Unusual Euphemism 'puppies' for breasts (referring to her own gigantic rack). She had previously played a different type of blonde in WCW.
-   Kelly Kelly was the most notable example of WWE's PG Era. She debuted portraying a Dumb Blonde, but these aspects of her character were phased out. From about 2009 onward, she was promoted as the sexy one of the Divas - the one the commentators would gush over, the one getting all the photoshoots on WWE.com, and the one taking centre stage in Fanservice matches. She eventually became champion in 2011 and had a lengthier reign than many who came before her.
-   Sable was the first real notable example of this in WWE. A beautiful blonde, she was initially a valet for Triple H and Marc Mero. But her beauty led to crowds wanting more of her...leading to her becoming a proper on-screen character and eventually Women's Champion. She then subverted the trope with a Face–Heel Turn to become The Primadonna after her _Playboy_ cover sold millions.
-   Stacy Keibler was a charismatic Ms. Fanservice who was a very popular member of the roster, despite rarely serving in a wrestling capacity.
-   Trish Stratus is the real Trope Codifier as far as WWE's Divas go. She had the beauty of the Attitude Era girls like Sable and Debra, while also plenty of tenacity in the ring - to make her a Plucky Girl too. Notably Trish did have two heel runs, but they were both very short in comparison to her face pushes. Trish's status as this led to WWE trying to recreate her success with other blonde women in later years.
-   Torrie Wilson was the top Face of the Smackdown brand during the Ruthless Aggression Era. She was presented as sexy, lovable and heroic - becoming massively popular only a few months after her debut. Like Trish, she had a couple of heel runs, but they were very brief because fans loved her too much.
-   Carmella was a trashy heel when she debuted and had two-toned hair (brown and blonde). Around the time she turned face to become a Good Bad Girl, her hair became fully blonde.

    Video Games 

-   Curly Brace the Robot Girl from _Cave Story_ she’s lovable, cute, shows off her belly button and will do a Heroic Sacrifice to save you. Curly is even more attractive in other media like in _Blade Strangers_ where she has Adaptational Curves.
-   Tina Armstrong from the _Dead or Alive_ games. A tall, blonde and busty American pro-wrestler and show-woman who oozes sex appeal and appears in some of the most revealing costumes in the series. French DOATEC heiress Helena Douglas is also blonde and has a lot of admirers, both in-game and in real life. _Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate_ brought in Rachel from _Ninja Gaiden_. With her blonde hair, S&M-like attire, large cup size, variety of sexy outfits, and proud, mature personality, she has given Helena and Tina a run for their money in terms of flaxen-haired sex appeal.
-   Trish from _Devil May Cry_ is an unabashed Badass Biker dressed in leather with Navel-Deep Neckline, just try not too think too hard about the fact she looks identical to Dante’s mother Eva.
-   _Donkey Kong Country_: Candy is Donkey Kong's girlfriend and Diddy's is Dixie. Both of them are blonde... primates.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Yoshitaka Amano _really loves blondes_ which is why there are so many blondes characters, particularly female ones in the games, e.g Terra and Celes in _Final Fantasy VI_. Amano even drew Tifa as blonde despite her being brunette in VII.
    -   Rosa from _Final Fantasy VI_ is considered the World's Most Beautiful Woman, both Cecil and Kain are in love with her. Kain temporarily becomes a Crazy Jealous Guy when Rosa prefers Cecil over him.
    -   Evil example in Scarlet from _Final Fantasy VII_ and The Hero Cloud Strife is a male example.
    -   _Final Fantasy VIII_ has Quistis Trepe who has her own fan club made up of her students.
    -   Rikku from _Final Fantasy X_ is cute on the first game but becomes extremely sexy in the sequel and frequently cosplayed in Real Life.
    -   Tidus clearly invokes this as part of his star Blitzball player image. He's a natural brunet but dyes his hair blond.
    -   _Final Fantasy X-2_ has a male example. Gippal, leader of the Machine Faction. Gets a gasp/sigh from Yuna when they first meet and Rikku practically throws herself at him (though insisting they were never a couple). Also seems to be pretty popular with the Al Bhed.
-   Kat from _Gravity Rush_ there’s no better titillation there a scantly clad blonde girl flying at high speeds into buildings with her Gravity Master powers.
-   Fiona Belli from _Haunting Ground_ (whose is also Hair of Gold, Heart of Gold) may be Capcom’s most overtly sexualised female character. Starting off the game in Vapour Wear Fiona appeases every fetish possible with her curvaceous body and her large moving mammaries were actually too distracting for some players. In the game itself Fiona is So Beautiful, It's a Curse as every male in castle is attracted to her and sole other female wants to kill her out of jealousy.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_, though Link and Zelda started out as brunette in most appearances they are blonde, blue eyed and extremely attractive. There’s also Ilia from Twilight Princess and Linkle from _Hyrule Warriors_ who's Link’s Distaff Counterpart.
-   Hideo Kojima has a soft spot for blondes in _Metal Gear_ with Navel-Deep Neckline e.g Sniper Wolf, The Boss, and Eva. There’s also Paz from _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_ and Courtney from _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_
-   _Metroid_: Samus Aran and we wonder why<small>◊</small>. Lovingly based off Kim Basinger, Samus as a badass planet busting bounty hunter, is still the most cable and strongest Nintendo woman to date. Samus is also the most sexualised Nintendo blonde compared to Peach or Zelda.
-   Sonya Blade from _Mortal Kombat_ the biggest Ms. Fanservice next to Mileena, Sonya is so hot she’s attracted the likes of Kano (who kept a lock of her gold hair in original timeline), Shang Tsung and even goddamn Big Bad Shao Khan in the comics. Sonya’s daughter Cassie inherited her mother blonde hair and good looks, but her father Johnny Cage’s mouth.
-   Ann Takamaki in _Persona 5_ is a quarter-Caucasian Japanese girl and a natural blonde, which causes her to stand out and helped kickstart her modeling career. This ends up being a double-edged sword, as she's often subjected to rumors of being "easy" by jealous classmates and at the start of the game she's being preyed on by their depraved Evil Teacher.
-   _Street Fighter_ has many many blondes:
    -   Cammy White is the foremost blonde in Street Fighter and beautiful enough to rival to main female character Chun-Li. Also to wearing a skin tight Leotard of Power Cammy is actually Too Hot for TV at times being censored in the SFV trailer and in _Wreck-It Ralph_ wears she leggings to cover her ample buttocks.
        -   Fittingly Cammy was portrayed by Kylie Minogue in the movie adaptation.
    -   The second most sexy blonde is R.Mika the most apparent Amazonian Beauty, uses her ass cheeks as deadly weapons. Mika was also too hot for trailers and her butt slap was censored.
    -   The third blonde is Maki Genryusai who made her way into Alpha from _Final Fight_ and is extremely hot and Hot-Blooded.
    -   The fourth is Karin Kanzuki, Sakura’s rival and Canon Immigrant from the manga. True she is a haughty Alpha Bitch most of the time but she’s still attractive and leads the World Warriors in a crisis.
        -   As a side note Maki being Japanese dyed her blonde so it’s likely R.Mika and Karin (who are also Japanese) bleached their hair as well.
    -   The fifth is Kolin whose got shapely thighs and her alternate costumes reveal a shapely bod. Though Kolin is also a cold hearted Russian Tragic Villain who works for The Illuminati which might be a deal breaker.
    -   The sixth SF blonde is Falke one of the one experimental clones like Seth and Ed, Falke is very hot and her alternate costume consist of a Qipao, Spy Cat Suit and sexy Christmas outfit.

-   _Super Mario Bros._ has Princess Peach the legendary Damsel in Distress and while she is not sultry or as sexualised as Samus still is adorably cute and dreamy. Peach has attracted dozens of men across the games. Mario, Bowser, Luigi, Wario and TEC XX (a Hal Expy who falls in love with Peach).

-   All of The Stingers in _Jem_ are blond. While Rapture is low on the fanservice, Minx and Riot are a case of Ms. Fanservice and Mr. Fanservice respectively. Minx is a seductive German Dude Magnet with some mild vamp qualities while Riot is a hunky 80s glam metal singer who attracts women in flocks. Despite this, neither Minx nor Riot can attract the people they really want to be it.
-   _Kaeloo_: Ursula is a blonde girl who is considered to be very attractive in-universe to the point of attracting any guy who sees her.
