_"You have nice manners, for a_ thief_, and a_ liar_."_

The male version of the Classy Cat-Burglar may lack the cat jokes and themes, but he makes up for it with roguish good looks coupled with a breeding and style that manifests as a suave and debonair manner. He's usually a charmer, too—think James Bond without the government authorization.

He steals for the challenge/pleasure of the job and generally avoids violence while restricting his targets to those who can afford the loss. More importantly for plots, these characters will often go out of their way to stop more serious crimes—especially with lives at stake—either on their own or with the help of the police. As such they often adhere to Thou Shalt Not Kill and/or are Technical Pacifists. Murdering your target or stealing from them at gunpoint is not very gentlemanly. It's not uncommon for the GT to give at least a part of the goods he steals to the poor, often while very cynically commenting on social injustice and how the rich surely got their wealth with dirty methods, so it's only fair to steal from them and then give to those who need it.

Like the Classy Cat-Burglar, the Gentleman Thief usually regards the police with a certain amount of disdain and condescension, and frequently leaves behind "calling cards" announcing who performed the crime; especially confident versions may announce their targets in advance to ensure a challenge. With a Worthy Opponent such as a Sympathetic Inspector Antagonist chasing him, they may have a less adversarial relationship, verging at times on friendship (and, sometimes, fraught with UST of the Dating Catwoman variety), where they do things such as leaving Big Bad crooks behind for their rival to take the credit for arresting. They're usually a Badass in a Nice Suit, occasionally doing the Tuxedo and Martini look. As he may not enjoy _actual_ risks, the Gentleman Thief may decide that gambling is beneath him and cheat instead. Expect him to do so with sophistication. If he does gamble, expect him to be almost supernaturally lucky, or a tournament-grade player without peers. In many cases, they steal because they can and for the thrill, not out of an actual monetary need (since they are often rich)—though it may be a way to stave off Rich Boredom. This is also why they will never give up thievery for simple gambling.

They do exist in Real Life, yet their most usual technique is not stealing per se, but more like conning the victim.

Sometimes overlaps with Phantom Thief or Karmic Thief. Sister trope to Venturous Smuggler. See also Scoundrel Code.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Black Rose, aka Keith Harcourt, from _Ashita no Nadja_, is the perfect example of the GT with social leanings as he snarks at the idea of philanthropy and _noblesse obligue_ which Nadja and his twin brother Francis supports. Later, however, he decides to give up stealing—because Francis has been mistaken as him _and_ is willing to go to jail for his sake.
-   Ijyuin Akira, the Man of Twenty Faces, in _CLAMP School Detectives_: a young gentleman thief, he steals according to the direction of his two mothers. This character is based on Japanese mystery author Edogawa Ranpo's "Fiend With Twenty Face".
    -   This character also reappears as "Twenty Faces" in _The Daughter of Twenty Faces_, who, among other things, steals national treasures that have been mislocated due to war to return them to their rightful place.
-   Dark from _D.N.Angel_ is called a Phantom Thief, but he's definitely an example of a Gentleman Thief as well. He steals only works of art, sends a warning letter before every steal, and definitely thinks less of the cops. It's also later revealed that he has a reason for why he steals.
-   The title character in _From Eroica with Love_; the title is actually what he leaves on his calling cards.
-   Lunlun meets one of these in the Egypt episode of _Hana Noko Lunlun_, a charming and stylish middle-aged man who plans to commit quite the robbery of Ancient Egyptian jewels/relics/etc. and tries to use her as his Unwitting Pawn. Uncommonly for this type of character, he _is_ captured by his Inspector Javert—but by that time Lunlun's innocence and kindness has touched his heart, and is last seen keeping flowers in his cellar.
-   Phoenix, the male lead in _Honey Honey_. Also the Jerk with a Heart of Gold to the female lead's Tsundere Plucky Girl.
-   Gentle Criminal from _My Hero Academia_ patterns himself as one: he dresses in a fancy suit, drinks expensive tea before each "job", only steals from the rich and/or corrupt, and brazenly posts videos of his exploits on the Internet. He _will_ resort to (non-lethal) violence if he has to, but isn't fond of doing so and cuts it out of his videos.
-   The titular _Lupin III_ is usually portrayed as a chivalrous thief, who only targets those who can afford it, or simply have it coming. But it usually isn't long before he ends up revealing his playful side. Though when it comes to women, he ranges from a chivalrous perv, to a Handsome Lech. Depending on the Writer, that is. In general, he's most distinctly a gentleman in _The Castle of Cagliostro_ and the more iconic TV shows, while in the original manga and most adaptations to pull from it, he's more distinctly a huge asshole.
    -   And, on a related note, we have the _Lupin III vs. Detective Conan_ anime special, where Conan chases after Lupin and Co. and they have to team up to rescue Ran, who's been caught in a massive conspiracy.
-   The illustrious _Magic Kaito_ (if he isn't too perverted to count) that sometimes appears also in _Case Closed_. He actually has a justifiable cause: his main target is a gemstone that hides a secret that can be seen under moonlight, a secret that cost his father's life as it's also the target of a criminal organization. That's why he almost always targets famous gemstones.
-   Hikaru from the _Medabots_ anime parodies the trope with his secret identity of Phantom Renegade, to the point that his Japanese name is actually Kaitou (literally "Phantom Thief/Bandit") Retort. He dresses up in a Tuxedo Kamen\-esque suit, top hat and mask ensemble, and he's a thief who goes around preemptively stealing rare Medabot Medals in order to keep them out of the hand of the evil Rubberrobos gang... however, he's very much _not_ a cool character. He's clumsy, bungling, has a daytime job as a lowly shopkeeper, and gets no respect, to the point he frequently tries to desperately hype up his own alter-ego to the main characters, who couldn't care less.
-   Mamoru "Tuxedo Kamen" Chiba in the manga and Live-Action version of _Sailor Moon_, though only to find the Silver Crystal so he can recover his long-lost memories, and he stops when they do find it and becomes solely a superhero. Sailor Moon even comments "He's just like Lupin the Thief! He's hot!" when she first sees him in the manga. It causes severe friction between him and the Senshi in the live-action version.
-   Cobra from _Space Adventure Cobra_ is a gentleman thief in a Space Opera setting. Despite being one of the most wanted criminals of the galaxy, he ends up helping the Space Police and battling the Space Mafia more often than not.

    Comic Books 

-   The Mexican comic version of Fantômas, going so far as to wear a top hat, opera cape, and cane while performing his second-story jobs. (He eventually stopped doing that, however.) Not to be confused with the original French character of the same name (see below), who is an utterly evil serial murderer and terrorist-for-no-particular-reason.
-   Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin.
-   Zagar, by the Italian comic artist Jacovitti. This thief, master of disguises, is a parody of this trope.
-   Casanova Quinn from Matt Fraction's _Casanova_ was one of these for a while... until he became a Martini-and-Absinthe-flavoured superspy.
-   _The DCU_:
    -   _Batman_:
        -   The Riddler, occasionally. His personality varies, actually.
        -   The Penguin started out this way but eventually settled into a role as a semi-legit restauranteur/arms dealer.
        -   Michael Baffle was a one-shot Golden Age foe (and obvious Expy of _Raffles_).
    -   _Hawkman_: Subverted with the Gentleman Ghost. He may put on airs at times, but he's a highwayman through and through. Being the bastard son of an English noble that was treated like a peasant all his life, he _tries_ to invoke the image wherever he can, but it's clearly an act.
    -   The anti-villain/anti-hero named The Shade has been presented this way since the 1994 _Starman_ series, though he hasn't done much thieving recently.
    -   As of _Wonder Woman (1987)_ Angle Man has gotten a revamp that includes a nice suit and hat and become a friendly if more unpredictable thief who always does his best to compliment the ladies. He also pays back his debts when Donna helps save his life.
-   From _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_
    -   The Black Knight from Don Rosa's comics who is a rather obvious Captain Ersatz of Arsene Lupin.
    -   Paperinik (Donald Duck superhero alter-ego) started out as this, and his first heist was to steal Scrooge's money-filled _mattress **as he was sleeping on it**._ Even now, as a superhero, he's capable of stealing anything, as shown that time he decided to track down the local kingpin of crime by faking an amnesia-motivated Face–Heel Turn to get approached and literally stole _half of Duckburg **single-handedly**_ (he later gave everything back).
        -   His in-universe inspiration lord Quackett/Fantomius (of whom Paperinik uses a modified version of the costume and took the gadgets used in the first story) was one in the Duckburg of the Roaring Twenties, to the point the trope name is present on both the title of his own series _and_ the Calling Cards he leaves at every heist. His love for the challenge is so great that, in the second story of his series, his answer to the chief of the police proclaiming he wouldn't be able to break out of prison once he succeeded in arresting him was to let himself get arrested and unmasked as lord Quackett, tell the guard that night he was supposed to burgle a safe, break out without anyone noticing, burgle the safe, _get back to jail from the main gate and break out again in a way that convinced everyone he wasn't lord Quackett_, being extremely polite and gentlemanly all the time (after all, as the second son of an English duke, he actually is a gentleman).
-   Subverted with Hunter Rose in _Grendel_, who has all the usual hallmarks (stealthy, cultured, literary, over-educated, has been known to wear a tuxedo at times) but is actually a ruthless organised-crime boss who kills huge numbers of sometimes completely innocent people.
-   Fingers from the _Lucky Luke_ story by the same name is an odd example that seems to fit but not really represent the same idea... perhaps a parody or deconstruction. He's an impeccably dressed magician with superficial good manners and suave charm that the ladies automatically love, and as skilled a thief as only a magician can be. He steals things for the sake of doing it and isn't really all that greedy. Yet what he really is is a kleptomaniac with no goal in life who keeps getting into trouble for stealing. One of his problems compared to more straight examples is that he can't help stealing petty things openly.
-   _Marvel Universe_:
    -   Spider-Man:
        -   The elderly criminal, the Black Fox. (His schemes usually revolved around making a big score so he could _retire_ from crime.)
        -   There's also Walter Hardy, father of the Black Cat. Unfortunately, he's something of a subversion in that he keeps retiring because he causes more harm than he intends to. In regular comics continuity and the '90s cartoon, he's tricked into working for Nazis and nearly gets them a Super-Soldier formula. In _The Spectacular Spider Man_, he became The Atoner after killing Uncle Ben in a moment of weakness.
    -   Shen Kuei, aka "The Cat" (he even has a tattoo of a cat on his chest), who is both this trope and a rare male example of the Classy Cat-Burglar at times. He's not only a skilled thief, but he also has martial arts skills that rival his arch-enemies Shang-Chi and Iron Fist.
    -   Gambit from _X-Men_ is a master thief and king of the Thieves Guild of New Orleans.
    -   Fantomex, also from _X-Men_ and the _X-Force_, who Grant Morrison based on the classic pulp characters Fantômas and Diabolik.
        -   In the first issue of _Uncanny X-Force_, he raids the Tower of London on a wager with Wolverine and, upon losing (Logan beat him to the vault), agrees to pay Logan with a case of cognac, worth "two million dollars a bottle". It's not about the money, but rather, it's simply "his poison".
        -   This was heavily implied to be a bet between the two where the loser had to buy a case of alcohol for the winner.
-   The Rogue from _The Maze Agency_ (who never actually appears on stage). His Calling Card is a note informing his victims that their stolen paintings have been selected for his 'Rogue's Gallery' and 'signed' with a cartoon figure (a la The Saint's haloed stick figure).
-   The Phantom Blot of the '40s, a villain from _Mickey Mouse Comic Universe_.
-   _Nikolai Dante_ becomes one after joining the Romanov Dynasty. After being wounded in a duel, he took to the Hotel Yalta to recuperate and held a massive party. Unfortunately for him, he discovers that in order to pay the extravagant bill he's run up, he would be forced to bankrupt the province that he just saved. So, he decides to rob several wealthy guests while masked, seducing several women in the process, which causes him to be referred to as the Gentleman Thief.
-   Steve Ditko deconstructed this trope in the _Mr. A_ story "Count Rogue". The titular Count Rogue acted Affably Evil toward his marks (while insulting all of them in his head) as part of a complicated plan to embarrass a rival at his day job who had been promoted before him. Mr. A is the only person who doesn't buy into the mystique of the Count as a noble thief, except for a burglar who randomly breaks into the Count's home at the end of the story, and gives an oddly on-the-nose "Not So Different" Remark while trying to blackmail his way into a "partnership".
-   Deconstructive Parody in the _Viz_ strip "Raffles the Gentleman Thug", in which the titular character is a well-spoken, aristocratic Jerkass who goes around beating people up for no reason.
-   _Astro City_: Ned Carroway originally started off as a dapper criminal called the Gentleman Bandit.

    Fairy Tales 

-   The title character of The Brothers Grimm version of "The Master Thief" is implied to be one. He surprises his parents by driving up to their old house in a fine carriage, and they mistake him for a nobleman at first.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, the Black Arachnid is re-imagined as one of these. He and an Officer Jenny made a promise of becoming famous one day when they were kids, and he chose this path by stealing from horrible people and leaving behind evidence to expose their crimes.

    Films — Animation 

-   Flynn Rider from _Tangled_ starts out as this.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   David Niven used to play this type of character frequently.
    -   A.J. Raffles in the 1939 film adaptation of _Raffles_.
    -   "Sir Charles Lytton, the Notorious Phantom", David Niven's (or Christopher Plummer's) character in _The Pink Panther_ movies.
    -   Niven also plays Colonel Matthews, the titular character of _The Brain (1969)_, where he, two petty crooks, and the mafia attempt to hijack a train transporting the NATO millions to the new NATO headquarters. Hilarity ensues.
-   Alfred Hitchcock's _To Catch a Thief_ follows John Robie (Cary Grant), a reformed Gentleman Thief, as he attempts to discover who has been framing him for a new spate of burglaries. It turns out to be a Classy Cat-Burglar.
-   The titular character of Jean-Pierre Melville's gangster movie _Bob Le Flambeur_ (_Bob the Gambler_) is incredibly well-dressed, stylish, debonair, and gentlemanly.
-   Cobb and Eames from Christopher Nolan's later and slightly more expensive feature, _Inception_.
-   Cobb from Christopher Nolan's low budget feature debut, _Following_. Although this is later revealed to be a cover for his _real_ plan, which was to murder the Woman and implicate the Writer.
-   In _Death Walks on High Heels_, Nicole's father was one. He is murdered by someone searching for his last score : a million dollars worth of diamonds.
-   Sean Connery's character in _Entrapment_ is just the bearded Scottish version of Pierce Brosnan's Irish _Thomas Crown_. Except Connery shares his screen time with a Classy Cat-Burglar and the infamous Laser Hallway.
-   Baron von Geigern in _Grand Hotel_ is a partial subversion. He actually fits the trope quite well—urbane, sophisticated, suave gentleman hotel thief—except for the fact that he's apparently being forced to be a hotel thief due to being deep in debt to bad people.
-   The protagonist of _Headhunters_ is an art burglar who refuses to invade occupied homes, moves quickly, and leaves a replica for the owner.
-   Robert De Niro's character in _Heat_, Neil McCauley, is a somewhat more realistic version of the Gentleman Thief.
-   Simon Dermott in _How to Steal a Million_.
    -   Subverted—he is actually an art expert working to uncover a forgery.
-   Hudson Hawk in _Hudson Hawk_, who sings show tunes to synchronize his robberies.
-   The film version of _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ boasts the cheeky Cockney rogue Rodney Skinner, 'Genn'lemun Thief', as the Invisible Man, in lieu of the psychopathic rapist original Invisible Man, Dr. Hawley Griffin. Skinner apparently stole Griffin's invisibility formula. He kind of fails at the whole "gentleman" part. But he's adorable anyway. He's kind of a Composite Character; he has the powers of Dr Griffin, who was a Sociopathic Hero at _best_ and would have made it nigh-impossible to avoid an M-rating without toning down his character a bit,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and the backstory of A.J. Raffles.
-   Basically every protagonist in _Ocean's 11_, _Ocean's 12_, and _Ocean's 13_, as well as the antagonist "Night Fox" Toulour, though to a lesser extent.
-   _The Old Man & the Gun_: A biopic of Forrest Tucker, a career criminal bank robber who robbed banks for the thrill of it and was known for his dapper and gentlemanly bearing during robberies. In the film, it's his behavior that helps investigators link his various crimes throughout the midwest to the same man.
-   Frank of _Robot and Frank_ is not particularly classy or refined, but still shows aspects of this archetype, such as his meticulous research before each job and his insistence that only "those insurance company crooks" will get hurt from his heists.
-   Nick Wells (Robert De Niro) in _The Score_. He even owns a jazz club.
-   Miles Cullen from _The Silent Partner_ is a downplayed version of this trope, being more affable and down-to-earth than polite and gentlemanly. He also always dresses in a suit, but only because he's a bank teller and his job requires him to do so.
-   Pierce Brosnan plays a millionaire trying to be a Gentleman Thief in _The Thomas Crown Affair (1999)_. "It's just a game, love; it's just a game." Complete with a literal calling card: a pencil with the name of his firm left plainly at the scene of the final caper!
    -   And, of course, the original 1968 film starring Steve McQueen.
-   _Twenty Bucks_: Gentleman Jimmy (Christopher Lloyd) always wears a suit and tie to knock over liquor stores, with lines like: "Good evening, we were just robbing the store, will you both lie down on the floor, please? Right now, please." "Thank you, have a nice evening."
-   The nameless Robber (played by William Powell) from _Jewel Robbery_. He's dressed well and treats his victims with respect.
    
    As a matter of fact, I'm opposed to the American school of banditry. I studied in Paris. You have to work harder but you do acquire a certain finesse that is missing from the stick-em-up and shoot-them-down school.
    
-   In the French comedic World War II movie _Gramps Is in the Resistance_, the Super-Résistant takes his inspiration from the Gentleman Thief rather than American superheroes — including the tuxedo, top hat and cape — to fight the Germans in Nazi-occupied France, mostly by ridiculing them.
-   In _The Cocoanuts_, Harvey Yates presents himself as a debonair gentleman, but he's secretly deep in debt and enters a scheme with his partner Penelope to steal a valuable diamond necklace.
-   \* In _We're No Angels_, Jules, the most polite and sophisticated of the convicts, had a long career as a brilliant safecracker before committing a murder unrelated to his string of thefts.

    Literature 

-   Arsène Lupin, titular thief of the French series of short stories and books written by Maurice Leblanc between 1905 and 1939, and five additional volumes written by Boileau-Narcejac in the 1970s. Also moonlights as a detective. Pretty much the Trope Namer of Gentleman Thief, as the first collection of short stories on the character is called _Arsène Lupin: Gentleman Cambrioleur_ (Arsène Lupin: Gentleman Burglar). He's also the Trope Codifier, exhibiting many of the tropes associated with this trope and Phantom Thief: Calling Cards, being a Master of Disguise, wearing a tuxedo and top hat (and a Domino Mask sometimes), announcing his crimes ahead of time, fighting evil criminals, and displaying a romantic attitude in general.
-   Fantômas is a literary and cinematic Gentleman Thief from France, and came to exist in the wake of Arsène Lupin's success. He's also kind of a psycho-murderer as well, very much an anti-Lupin.
-   Subverted to pieces in the essay _Memoirs of a Private Detective_ by Dashiell Hammett:
    
    _Second only to Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is Raffles in the affections of the daily press. The phrase "gentleman crook" is used on the slightest provocation. A composite portrait of the gentry upon whom the newspapers have bestowed this title would show a laudanum-drinker, with a large rhinestone-horseshoe aglow in the soiled bosom of his shirt below a bow-tie, leering at his victim, and saying: "Now don't get scared, lady, I ain't gonna crack you on the bean. I ain't a rough-neck!"_
    
-   The Saint, AKA Simon Templar, is such a Gentleman Thief in the original stories (and also Ambiguously Brown as well, unusual in those days) that the TV series cleaned him up a lot, though not entirely. He doesn't always quite adhere to the code, though, in that he does not shrink from murdering criminals as well as taking their money. On one occasion, he ties the villains of the story up in an abandoned house, to which he then sets fire, leaving them to burn alive. Granted, they were going to do the same to him and his cohorts, but, still — not entirely gentlemanly behavior.
-   Philip Collin, aka Professor Pelotard, from the various books and short stories by Frank Heller. One thing that helps make Collin into one of the more memorable gentleman thieves is the fact that his first crimes are the same as his creator's, who, before becoming an author, was a swindler who went into a self-imposed exile in order to escape the Swedish police.
-   The Thieves Guild in _Discworld_ is said to run special courses for Gentleman Thieves. It's one thing being robbed, but it's annoying to learn that your possessions were stolen by a man in a borrowed suit.
    -   The Discworld Assassins' Guild has a large proportion of gentleman members; this is because the Guild runs one of the best schools on the Disc, specialist subjects aside, and many upper-class boys get their education there before going on to other careers. It's not all upper-class males, though; the school now has two all-girls houses, and offers scholarships to prospective students who are too poor to pay the fees but show potential to be _really good at killing people_. However, they never _steal_ anything — just as they don't expect the Thieves Guild to kill people. There's clear job demarcation.
    -   Moist von Lipwig may have scammed people out of all their money, but he has never committed a violent crime. Plus, after the challenge of his new job wore off, he turns to breaking into _his own building_. But the trope is somewhat deconstructed, when Mr. Pump states that, despite Moist's rules and gentlemanly nature, he's still killed 2.338 people, albeit indirectly, by the damage he's done to people's lives.
    -   In _Men at Arms_, though, Edward D'Eath seems to think there could be no such thing as a gentleman thief: "If he had trained as a Fool, he would have invented satire and made jokes about the Patrician. If he had trained as a Thief (of course, no gentleman would _dream_ of being trained as a Thief) he would have broken into the palace and stolen something very valuable from the Patrician."
-   Hugenay (Huganay?), the art thief from the kid detective series "The Three Investigators" is a borderline case. Began as Faux Affably Evil and choose to drop the faux later (even co-working with the heroes sometimes). In any case, he's still at large.
-   Quinn/Alex from Kay Hooper's _Once a Thief_ and _Always a Thief_ novels fits this to a T, though he prefers the term "cat burglar".
-   Several already mentioned on this page appear in the Massive Multiplayer Crossover that is _Anno Dracula_. In _Daikaiju_, Jeperson sardonically reflects that "Anthony Peak" (named, incidentally, after a species of lupin) is the sort of chap who steals a Formal Full Array of Cutlery in the correct order.
-   _The Baron_ was John Creasy's version of _The Saint_.
-   Silk, also known as Prince Kheldar, from _The Belgariad_ and the _Malloreon_, is an excellent example of this. Of course, he is also a spy. And a successful entrepreneur to the point that he can get away with the Mallorean government being aware of him being this trope and a spy (well, an important and very good spy. All Drasnian merchants are assumed to be spies), simply by being so integral to their economy that it'd crash if he withdrew.
-   _The Crimson Shadow_: Oliver deBurrows, a charming and chivalrous "highway halfling".
-   _Dinotopia: Journey to Chandara_ has a highwayman who robs travelers of all their possessions and gives them all of their loot from the previous victim.
-   _Drenai_ saga:
    -   Bowman, a Robin Hood-esque outlaw from _Legend_.
    -   Scaler from its sequel.
-   Jack Foley, an Elmore Leonard character (from _Out of Sight_ and _Road Dogs_). While he worked as a bank robber, he made a point of never using a gun while robbing more banks than anyone else in the FBI databanks. In the film version of _Out of Sight_, we get to see him in action, using only the _suggestion_ of violence to rob a bank teller: he even talks politely with the stressed-out girl during the whole ordeal, to the point where she reflexively wishes him a good day when he leaves. It's only when he's dealing with genuine thugs that Foley gets violent. In the follow-up novel, _Road Dogs_, an FBI agent desperate to arrest Foley is only obsessed with the ex-con because he's worried that the media will some day find out about Foley's story and turn him into a Gentleman Thief anti-hero.
-   Flambeau is a clever, strong, joking, and very tall jewel thief of the _Father Brown_ series by G. K. Chesterton. His name means "_torch_" in French. He liked to use paradoxical disguises (as in _The Queer Feet_). After several encounters with Father Brown, the trope was deconstructed in "The Flying Stars", in which Father Brown pointed out that he had thoughtlessly left a situation where an innocent person was likely to be blamed for the crime he committed and persuaded him that it was impossible to remain a honourable outlaw without Slowly Slipping Into Evil. He then reformed and became a private detective.
-   The title of Scott Lynch's _Gentleman Bastard_ series (starting with ''The Lies of Locke Lamora") is a nod to this trope. The main characters were raised in a street gang called the Gentleman Bastards and were trained in a wide variety of skills in order to pull of complex cons and thefts, especially against the wealthy upper-class. In reality the gang and Locke in partiuclar are a deconstruction of the trope, with skills to blend in with the upper class to pull their cons, but still a degree of brutal praticality needed to survive in the criminal underworld. Locke is known to the upper class as the mysterious gentleman thief the "Thorn of Camorr" and the wealthy generally expect him to live up to this trope, but in reality he won't hesitate for a moment to fight dirty or even kick a few dogs if needed. He still has his standards, but often takes advanatge of the expectation for him to act more nobely, such as when he escapes a Poison and Cure Gambit by punching the old woman trying to pull it on him in the face and stealing the antidote before fleeing.
-   The _In Death_ series: you can be sure that Roarke became this as he became an adult. He is as suave as they come and is certainly an expert at stealing.
-   In _The Iron Teeth_ web serial, the Robin Hood-like bandit leader the White Raven is an example of this trope. He was apparently honorable, charming, and rarely killed anyone.
-   Nobby Cranton from the _Lord Peter Wimsey_ novel _The Nine Tailors_ pretends to be a Gentleman Thief. The only impediment is that he isn't a gentleman.
-   Nicholas Valiarde (Donatien), a recurring character in Martha Wells's _Ile-Rien_ series and the hero of the novel _The Death of the Necromancer_, is a master art thief from whom no wealthy collector's mansion is safe.
-   Kelsier and his crew from _Mistborn_ by Brandon Sanderson. Breeze however is the culmination of this trope in the group. He lives the fine wines and finer suits, and is the most larcenous of the team, whereas the others are usually a little more hands-on and prone to mingling with the skaa.
-   The titular character in the _Montmorency_ series is an interesting twist on this. He is a gentleman and a thief, but not both at the same time at first. He often struggles about which one is his real self and ends up progressing from a common pickpocket to a spy for the British government, at which point he truly becomes a Gentleman Thief.
-   Nick Velvet (from a series of short stories by Edward D. Hoch) is a professional thief for hire, with a peculiar specialty: for a flat fee, he steals only objects of negligible apparent value. Since his first appearance in _Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine_ in September 1966, he has stolen such things as an old spiderweb (which he was then obliged to replace), a day-old newspaper, and a used teabag. His original fee for a theft was $20,000. In 1980, he raised it to $25,000 at the urging of his long-time girlfriend Gloria (who met Nick in 1965 when he was burgling her New York apartment); in the 21st century, his fee has risen to $50,000. Unlike many fictional thieves, Nick usually works alone on his thefts—in fact, until 1979, Gloria believed that Nick worked for the U.S. government.
-   Seregil and, later, Alec in Lynn Flewelling's _Nightrunner_ books.
-   The Jackal, in Catherine Fisher's _The Oracle Trilogy_, is a pretty good example.
-   Psmith, prone to occasional petty theft under the guise of "practical socialism", goes full-blown gentleman thief in his last installment, _Leave It to Psmith_, wherein he's hired to steal a diamond necklace. He's hindered by the fact that some rather less-gentlemanly characters have been put onto the same job...
-   Jean le Flambeur from _The Quantum Thief_ is a transhuman version of the character archetype, closely based on Arsène Lupin. He's a master thief in a day and age when upload-collectives rule the Solar System, and minds are a dominant currency.
-   _Raffles_: Raffles is a character who has been around in literary form since the 1890s. Invented by E. W. Hornung, who meant him to be a subversion of the trope: definitely not a nice guy, and stealing for profit rather than for fun or altruism. (See further discussion under Depraved Bisexual.) It was no use, though; Hornung's readers saw Raffles as glamorous anyway, and later incarnations of the character invariably make him into a hero.
    -   See the other Wiki for a list of works featuring Raffles. He has also appeared as a minor character in the webcomic _Scary Go Round_ (see below).
    -   The difference between Raffles as created by Hornung, and Raffles as developed by others was parodied by Jon L. Breen in "Ruffles versus Ruffles", where the no-good crook and the heroic adventurer are brothers: A.J. Ruffles and R.J. Ruffles.
-   _The Scarlet Pimpernel_: Although Sir Percy Blakeney is only a "thief" in that he "steals" people sentenced to the guillotine during the Reign of Terror - nonetheless most aspects of his character and methods conform to this trope, right down to leaving a calling card at the scene.
-   _Shadows of Self_ (second book of _Wax and Wayne_, sequel to _Mistborn_): The Marksman sets himself up as this, which is why Wax was willing to leave him to the city watch. But then the Marksman started killing people in the course of his robberies.
-   Eli Monpress of _The Spirit Thief_ is this, and also a wizard. His "light" (_it's hard to explain, you have to see it_, say all the spirits) makes it so that most spirits will do as he asks without a servant or a slave bond (as the good guys and the bad guys use, respectively), letting him pull off blatantly impossible acts of wizardry. His goal in life is to increase his bounty to one million golden standards (an insane amount, quoted as being more money than exists in the world).
-   "Slippery" Jim diGriz, the protagonist of _The Stainless Steel Rat_. Living in a future where only a genius could ever make it as a crook, diGriz considers himself a public benefactor who spices up the lives of local police and keeps money in circulation.
-   Gary Karkofsky a.k.a Merciless: The Supervillain without Mercy TM in _The Supervillainy Saga_ is this without the gentleman part. Described by the author as "Hudson Hawk with magic", he's someone who wishes he could rob banks and museums with impunity but constantly gets roped into fighting worse villains instead.
-   Panamon Creel from _The Sword of Shannara Trilogy_ does an amazing impression of one of these, yet at the core, he's far more of an Affably Evil highwayman than he is one of these, and he knows it, putting on the act in an attempt at convincing himself that he hasn't wasted his life.
-   Leighton, the villain of _The Thinking Machine_ story "The Missing Necklace", is a master jewel thief that Scotland Yard has been pursuing for years.
-   _Tortall Universe_:
    -   George Cooper of _Song of the Lioness_ is King of the Thieves and keeps "court", which has rules that he follows. He's a Worthy Opponent to the Lord Provost and has no problem befriending a couple of pages.
    -   Rosto the Piper in the _Beka Cooper_ books is sometimes speculated to have been a Scanran noble or similar because he's clearly well-educated and considered to be a very sensible Rogue.
-   John Tregarth from Elizabeth Peters' _Vicky Bliss_ series.
-   Walter Jon Williams's _Drake Maijstral_ series is entirely based on this trope. Drake is an "allowed burglar", which is actually a legal profession in the far future galactic empire. You may legally ply burglary as your trade if _and only if_ you are a _gentleman_ thief. You must always behave as a gentleman (or woman). Violence is forbidden. When you steal something, it doesn't become yours for 24 hours, and if you do get caught during that time, you must surrender politely or risk losing your license. And the thing you stole must stay under your control or that of a subordinate for the full 24 hours—no hiding it in a drainpipe and hoping nobody finds it. You are also expected to steal _classy_ things. Which is not to say that you _can't_ steal cash from a bank vault. But if that's _all_ you steal, you may be in trouble. Allowed burglars are literally judged on style.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The Kings go after a gentleman thief in the _Breakout Kings_ episode "One for the Money".
-   The Pontiac Bandit in _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_ isn't technically a gentleman, but he's pretty much this trope in almost every other respect (or at least as close as a car thief who only ever jacks Pontiacs can get). He's an incredibly affable, friendly, and likeable guy who clearly likes Detective Peralta, the police officer trying to catch him... but who clearly likes playing mind-games with Peralta and outwitting him to get away scot-free even _more_.
-   Jerry Fagin, an international jewel thief who made a single appearance in _Cagney & Lacey_ solely to challenge Cagney to a duel of wits. His first action is to pull a heist and plant evidence all over the scene that points to the police department itself. When this becomes clear, Cagney immediately says, "Jerry Fagin! Nobody else would do this with such unmitigated . . . style!"
-   Carlton Dial from _Fortune Hunter_ was a gentleman thief on the side of the angels.
-   The Cat from the _Funky Squad_ episode "Diamonds Are a Cat's Best Friend".
-   Autolycus, the King of Thieves of _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_ and _Xena: Warrior Princess_ fame.
-   _Hustle_ likes to play with this one. It's Albert's favourite character, despite him being a former cobbler. Mickey tends to be suave and debonair, as well. The others, not so much...
-   _It Takes a Thief_ was about a second-generation Gentleman Thief who was caught and given the choice of prison or helping the government. He chose helping the government. Inspired by, though not based upon, the 1955 Cary Grant motion picture _To Catch a Thief_ (see above). Notable for starring Robert Wagner as the thief and Fred Astaire!!! as his father, who says at the start of every third season episode, "I've heard of stealing _from_ the government, but stealing _for_ the government?".
-   Steve McBride, James McAvoy's character in Series 1-2 of _Shameless (UK)_, who is also known as a middle-class thief. His American counterpart also counts, though it's also deconstructed some as his criminal connections also give him (and by extension, the Gallagher family) trouble.
-   The Lupinrangers from _Kaitou Sentai Lupinranger VS Keisatsu Sentai Patranger_ are essentially this, being ordered to reclaim the items once stolen from Arsene Lupin aptly collectively named the "Lupin Collection".
-   _Leverage_
    -   Archie Leach, played by Richard Chamberlain was Parker's mentor and appears to still be effective despite being retired. He is almost never without his canes, one has a 6-inch stiletto blade and the other is a taser capable of delivering 10,000 volts. He once stole an ancient Chinese artifact by getting into a fancy party dressed as a waitstaff pushing a cake, which is hollow, past security before putting on his suit and walking about. A simple swap, after using the taser cane to make the lights go off, real sword into the cake and fake handle in the place, and he walks out without a second glance.
    -   The main crew plays with this idea. While they always are the Brains, Grifter, Hitter, Hacker, and Thief<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , the victims they are helping never know their roles, and the bad guys are sometimes made to believe that the roles have been switched. Sometimes that's the plan, and sometimes it's in response to a thrown curveball. Nathan, as the Brains, does play Gentleman Thief at times, as have the rest of them every so often. Some of the best episodes come when the team are forced into roles that are far outside their comfort zone.
-   _Mission: Impossible_: In "For Art's Sake", the IMF have to shut down a murderous gentleman thief and recover his store of stolen art.
-   Dennis Stanton, a Recurring Character in _Murder, She Wrote_, was a Gentleman Thief in his first appearance, although, in later appearances, he used his skills as an insurance investigator. He worked by three rules: he never steals from anyone who can't afford it, he never steals anything with sentimental value, and he makes sure that everything he steals is insured by the company who refused to pay for his late wife to have a life-saving operation.
    -   Another episode featured an art thief who eventually proved to be this: once exposed by Jessica he quite politely and affably admitted to his crimes, explained his motive, noted that he only stole insured works and he even returned the last work that he'd stolen (he'd fenced the rest). Of course, there was the matter of the murder committed during one of the thefts of which he was innocent.
-   Assane Diop of Netflix's _Lupin_. He based his thieving style on Arsène Lupin.
-   Mamoru Chiba, aka Tuxedo Kamen, in the Live Action Adaptation of _Sailor Moon_.
-   Subverted in the _Psych_ episode, "Extradition: British Colombia." Pierre Despereaux seems to be one of these, but as it turns out it's actually an elaborate art-insurance scam: the owners let Desperaux steal the art (who then presumably sells it on the black market or perhaps keeps some of it himself), so the cash-strapped owners can collect the insurance money rather than having to sell the art themselves (which is rather embarrassing).
    -   Played straight when he comes back in later episodes. He lives up to his previously fake legacy, and really _is_ an amazing thief and escape artist.
-   _Remington Steele_ was this kind of character before taking over his role as a private investigator.
-   Neal Caffrey from _White Collar_ presents himself like this but comes from a blue-collar background and a large payout is his primary motivation for committing crimes. Flashbacks also show that if he is low on funds, he is not above doing basic street-level cons.
-   _Wonder Woman_: Evan Robley in "The Queen and the Thief". He charms the Queen, is hired to steal the crown jewels, is clearly uncomfortable with guns or violence (although he does beg off from confronting Wonder Woman, so it may just be pragmatism), and joins forces with Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor to foil the evil plot of Ambassador Orrick. And is appointed an ambassador for doing so.

    Music 

-   French singer Jacques Dutronc has a song called "Gentleman Cambrioleur" about such a guy. A cambrioleur is a burglar, by the way.
-   In Woody Guthrie's "Pretty Boy Floyd", the titular outlaw pays off the mortgages of farmers facing eviction, leaves a $1,000 bill under a hungry stranger's napkin, and drops off a carload of groceries for families on relief. Near the end, Woody muses that some rob with a gun and others rob with a fountain pen, yet an outlaw would never drive a family from their home.

    Mythology and Legend 

-   Robin Hood, in his usual classic portrayals, robs from the rich and gives to the poor. In some versions, he is a former Noble, making him more literally a Gentleman Thief.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The point of the indie solo RPG ''Gentleman Bandit, to the point where the mechanics aren't about actually doing crime; they're focused on writing a poem about why you're doing crime.
    
    _You're a highwayman of the old guard, possessed of a fine suit and even finer elocution._
    
-   _Mutants & Masterminds_ has Magpie, who has the added advantage of being able to teleport (though he's still a skilled-enough acrobat, athlete, contortionist and escape artist to not _need_ that ability). His main foe was the sceond Raven, whom he shamelessly flirted with <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . He "admires beauty in all its forms", leaves a calling card at the scene of each theft, and his code of honor forbids him from stealing from those who have very little, or engaging in crimes with the potential to turn violent (i.e, kidnapping, murder, drug-running). As of 3e, he's taking on apprentices.

    Video Games 

-   Trilby, from the _Chzo Mythos_ and its platformer Gaiden Game, _Trilby: The Art of Theft_, all by Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw, of _Zero Punctuation_ fame, who stole his hat. This is most pronounced in _The Art Of Theft_: He only steals from the rich or other criminals, doesn't like resorting to lethal force, leaves his calling card with a picture of his hat, and anonymously donates one of his prizes to science. He'll even abandon heists if he's done too much damage (e.g. knocked out too many guards). After the events of _5 Days a Stranger_, he Goes Mad from the Revelation and is captured and made to work for the government.
-   Carmen Sandiego of the self-titled gaming franchise is a female variant. She's cultured and suave but is the world's best thief nevertheless. Her fashion tastes are conservative though (it _is_ a children's series), always in a full-length trench coat and wide-brimmed fedora, which is why she isn't under Classy Cat-Burglar. She was one of the best a star ACME agents until she took a Face–Heel Turn due to boredom.
-   Roguefort Cookie from _Cookie Run_, while not confirmed to be male, is pretty masculine presenting and otherwise fits the criteria. They dress in a fancy suit, top hat, and monocle and carry a Classy Cane. They steal almost exclusively jewls, leave calling cards, and are know for being very charming. They are also very friendly towards their two main rivals, Walnut Cookie and Almond Cookie.
-   Risque the thief, from _Dokapon Kingdom_. He acts similarly to Boo in the _Mario Party_ series, but instead of a ghostly cackle, he has a roguish laugh and a nice hat.
-   _Dragon Age II_ has Varric, a Merchant-Prince. He's even introduced stopping a pickpocket from robbing Hawke, pinning the thief to the wall with a crossbow bolt, then while he's trapped casually offers some advice on how to rob people;
    
    **Varric:** You know, I once knew a guy once who could take every coin out of your pockets just by smiling at you! But you, you don't have the _style_ to work Hightown, let alone the Merchants' Guild! _\[takes the coin back\]_ You might want to find yourself a new line of work? _\[punches him and pulls out the bolt\]_ Off you go!
    
    -   Hawke also falls into this role, at least in Act I where they're doing mercenary work, and in the "Mark of the Assassin" DLC where s/he assists a beautiful assassin in stealing a priceless jewel. Well, not really, but they are trying to recover something valuable.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   Throughout the series, when playing the Thieves' Guild quest line, it is often encouraged for the Player Character to be one. The Guild is generally violence averse, and several of the games offer greater rewards when Thieves Guild quests are completed without bloodshed, encouraging Actual Pacifism. You can also choose to dress in fancy clothing and rob only the rich outside of your quests and, since you generally make a lot of money easily in these games, you'll rarely ever have to steal for an actual living.
    -   In _Morrowind_, Thieves Guild Master Thief Gentleman Jim Stacey is one. He dresses in a full suit of "extravagant" clothing, speaks tactfully, and wants to revive the Bal Malogmer, an ancient group of Just Like Robin Hood thieves practice Karmic Thievery.
    -   In _Oblivion_, the Gray Fox serves as leader of the Thieves Guild. Once the curse on his Gray Cowl is lifted, he is revealed to be a literal example: Count Corvus Umbranox, Lord of Anvil.
    -   The late former Guildmaster Gallus in _Skyrim_ definitely counted when he was alive — he once formed a steadfast friendship with a guy _while he was robbing him_. This is especially noticeable when contrasted with the Arc Villain of the Thieves Guild storyline, Mercer Frey, who's revealed to be nothing but a treacherous cutthroat with zero class.
-   Somewhat subverted with Loxley from _Fallout_ who deliberately styles himself after Robin Hood, giving himself an exaggerated British accent and a "jolly-good" attitude that makes him stick out like a sore thumb against the gritty post-apocalyptic American landscape. He claims to not like killing, hates the cops and Water Merchants in the Hub, and has the others in his Thieves Circle donate part of their winnings to the poor, but his highly condescending nature make him less altruistic than he wants to appear as.
-   Balthier from _Final Fantasy XII_ is the embodiment of this trope.
    -   Locke from _Final Fantasy VI_ (though he prefers the term 'treasure hunter').
    -   Zidane from _Final Fantasy IX_, who is one of the nicest and well-adjusted heroes of the entire _Final Fantasy_ series despite being a Casanova Wannabe.
-   What Colm from _Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones_ grows into in his solo ending. If you get him to marry Neimi through supports, he gives it up to protect his new family.
-   Chat Noir from _Granblue Fantasy_ loves the thrill of the challenge and never acts maliciously towards his opponents. He generally tries to play fair by using a calling card to tip off his victims to see if they can beat him. And he looks the appearance right down to the monocle, top hat, and jewel tipped cane.
-   Sky Pirate Johnny from _Guilty Gear_.
-   Skye from _Harvest Moon DS_ has—are you ready for this?—a "Maiden Chick Beam" that _freezes_ women so that he can steal from them (of course, they're usually too busy swooning to stop him anyways). He also leaves a note before he steals, informing his targets of when he will arrive.
-   Daroach, leader of the eponymous gang of thieves in _Kirby: Squeak Squad_, certainly gives off this vibe, what with the nice hat and scepter. It's lampshaded in a few of his hints in _Mass Attack_.
-   The Phantom class from _MapleStory_.
-   In _Mass Effect 3_ Citadel DLC's casino mission, you come across a self-professed turian "con artist" on the prowl. He insists he is not a "con man", as those leave their marks angry. He, like other con artists, leave their marks smiling.
-   P.B. Winterbottom from _The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom_. It's always pie but still, he never paid for it.
-   In _Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine_ this role is filled (Naturally) by The Gentleman.
-   Invoked by the heroes of _Persona 5_, who moonlight as fancily dressed thieves who leave Calling Cards and target the wealthy and powerful who have exploited their positions to hurt others. Further, the Protagonist wields an Anthropomorphic Personification of his own psyche styled after Arsène Lupin, the Trope Codifier.
-   Mask☆DeMasque, from _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_, who carries out his thieving with Don Quixote\-esque enthusiasm. The _personality_ is not there, however, as Ron DeLite is a Nervous Wreck Cowardly Lion who steals primarily to support his wife's shopping habit.
    -   The Yatagarasu in _Investigations_, except the calling card is always sent _after_ the theft...and what the Yatagarasu steals is the "truth". In other words, they (yes, _they_) uncover, steal, and deliver to the media incriminating information regarding people who otherwise can't be touched by the law, so that they'll actually be forced to pay for their crimes. The Yatagarasu's signature music is even CALLED Gentleman Thief.
-   Sly Cooper is a cartoonish, raccoon\-ish, video game equivalent. He even has his own Worthy Opponent in the form of Carmelita Fox, with whom UST is a pronounced, recurring theme.
-   Mr. L, Luigi's Brainwashed and Crazy alter-ego from _Super Paper Mario_.
-   The Silver Zephyr in _Wario: Master of Disguise_ as the titular main character from the Show Within a Show Wario stumbles into (in more ways than one). At least until Wario stole the sentient magic cane which powered his transformations into his alter ego.
-   The Gentleman Thief from _Zork I_, naturally.

    Webcomics 

-   Monsieur in _Bandette_ is a highly-cultured, impeccably-mannered antiquarian book dealer, who is also a cat burglar who steals antiques and art objects from people who don't appreciate them enough.
-   Mr. Hyde robs banks, stores, and the rich, but he also takes pride in being well dressed and he even has a chivalrous side in _MK's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde_.
-   _Scary Go Round_ occasionally features "Raffles", who lives the trope so determinedly that he may well be designed as an Intercontinuity Crossover from the original _Raffles_ stories, despite the different time period.
-   The Hourglass of _Wake of the Clash_ is a thief of substantial popularity, rivaling that of Airstrike, whose fans can be seen right beside his, sporting themed merch during heists. He often spouts off cutting one-liners and clever insults at the heroes he faces and deftly maneuvers his heists to be as flashy as possible. It has been mentioned by the author that Hourglass will often play up their fights to make their escapades more entertaining to onlookers.

    Web Original 

-   The Onion: Bad Boy Fencing Star Implicated In Daring Jewel Heist.
-   Roman Torchwick of Rooster Teeth's _RWBY_ has the looks and attitude, though he's a straight-up gangster rather than the burglar or pickpocket associated with the trope. He's well-dressed in a white jacket and ascot, with a cigar and derby hat completing the look, full of snappy witticisms with a cane/RPG for a weapon.
-   Jeremy Archer from _Shadow of the Templar_. He uses non-lethal weapons to avoid killing people during his thefts, has sexual tension with Simon, the FBI agent chasing after him in the first novel (which stops being tension soon after), and acts as an occasional consultant for Simon's team on cases involving more dangerous criminals or that involve his area of expertise.
    -   The trope is kind of subverted in that, while he's extremely charming, any time he charms a woman, he does it with tongue firmly in cheek. It's implied that basically everyone knows he's gay (the team doesn't know because Jeremy doesn't want to mess up Simon's life). According to Word of God, he's bisexual with a preference toward men.
    -   It's also played with in that he falls pretty well under Classy Cat-Burglar (what with the Spy Catsuit and the Dating Catwoman with Simon), despite being male.

    Western Animation 

-   In Episode 53 of _Kaeloo_, Kaeloo and Stumpy pretend to be Gentleman Thieves.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Pinkie Pie describes Donut Joe as a Gentleman Thief expy of James Bond when she accuses him of eating the desserts on the train. It Makes Sense in Context. Twilight Sparkle is _very_ quick to correct her.
    
    **Twilight Sparkle:** Joe is not sleek, stealthy Con Mane! He's big, gruff, and messy!
    
-   Popeye encounters one of these in "Choose Yer Weppins".
-   The one-shot character Malloy from _The Simpsons_. After being caught at the end of the episode, he graciously returns the items he has stolen—immediately followed by tricking _the entire town of Springfield_ into searching for his buried stash while he escapes their jail.
-   Barack Obama, John McCain, and the rest of the thief club in the _South Park_ episode "About Last Night". Trey and Matt mention that _Ocean's Eleven_ was their inspiration for their theft plot, so that helps.

-   Red X from _Teen Titans (2003)_. He also has a bit of a Worthy Opponent relationship with Robin that occasionally delves into Friendly Enemy at certain points, with Red X deliberately placing himself in situations where he might be caught in order to help Robin (and, by extension, the rest of the Titans). It's made most obvious in the episode "Revved Up" when the two are racing on their motorcycles (and against other villains) in order to be the first to steal an already once-stolen case that is incredibly important to Robin. After a stray bomb throws Red X from his bike, Robin saves Red X's life by grabbing him out of mid-air and pulling him onto Robin's own motorcycle.
    
    **Red X:** The briefcase _really_ means that much to you?  
    **Robin:** _\[grimly\]_ You have _no_ idea.  
    **Red X:** Then go get it.  
    _\[Red X leaps off the back of the R-Cycle, then proceeds to effortlessly take out every other villain in the race, along with their vehicles, in about five seconds\]_
    
-   Phantom Limb from _The Venture Bros._ is another example. It is canon that Phantom Limb is the descendant of Fantômas.

    Real Life 

-   In his memoirs, badass early-1900s detective Frederick Porter Wensley refers to the Spider, a brilliant Gentleman Thief who turned to a life of crime for a sense of adventure.
-   The "Dean of American Bank Robbers", Harvey Bailey.
-   Son'ka the Golden Hand (Сонька Золотая Ручка) was a famous lady thief and con artist of Imperial Russia during the late 19th century, who casually robbed the rich bourgeoisie of tens of thousands of rubles, posing as an aristocrat.

-   There was a period when the fashion for stage magicians included exploiting this image. When performing for wealthier groups, part of the act would usually include mingling with and pick-pocketing from the audience (and ostentatiously returning the loot).
-   Samuel Bellamy, better known as "Black Sam", achieved a reputation for being known as the "Prince of Pirates", and he even likened himself to Robin Hood, and his crew called themselves "Robin Hood's Men" and sometimes called their captain the "Robin Hood of the Sea". His appearance was that of a tall, strong, well-mannered, and very tidy man, by which time he was known as "Black Bellamy". He captured more than 50 ships, and his accumulated wealth is estimated today to be worth $120 million in 2008 dollars. His leadership style was democratic, and he was well-liked by his men. Sadly, his life was cut short when he was killed at age 28 in a shipwreck off the Massachusetts coast.
-   Stede Bonnet was known as the "Gentleman Pirate" due to having been moderately wealthy before turning to his life of crime, which was instigated by a desire to get away from his nagging wife (and possible mental illness). He treated his crew like employees and paid them regular wages, as opposed to splitting whatever plunder they got. He even served under Blackbeard for a time, at least until Blackbeard ditched him and ran off with his share of the loot. Unlike Black Sam, Bonnet wasn't well-respected by his men as his lack of experience led to him making asinine decisions like challenging a Spanish man-o'-war.
-   Forrest Tucker, who spent his whole life up to his late 70s robbing banks with a gentlemanly manner.
-   Black Bart the stagecoach robber earned notoriety for his courtesy during robberies. He never swore, never fired his shotgun, and left behind whimsical poems after two of his robberies.
-   _Winona Ryder_, oddly enough. She had an infamous event where she was arrested for shoplifting, but generally has a reputation for being a Nice Girl, and even the _cops who arrested and interrogated her_ described her as a "nice lady".
-   Matthew Brady, AKA "Gentleman Brady". A servant, probably a groom, who stole a few small food items and a basket in England and was transported to Australia, he became a bushranger after escaping and was known for his courtesy, especially towards women. He also had a reputation for quick wit, responding to the governor posting a price on his head by offering a reward for the governor's! One article on his career reported that when robbing a reverend's house, the priest begged them not to disturb his wife, so the gang plundered the house in dead silence. When Brady's luck ran out and he was sentenced to hang, his cell was full of gifts sent by admirers, there were multiple petitions to spare his life, and while he did complain at having to share the gallows with a cannibalistic serial killer, he was reported to Face Death with Dignity.
