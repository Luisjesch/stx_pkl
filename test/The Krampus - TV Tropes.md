"Greetings From Krampus!"

_Sei nur brav und niemals keck,  
Dann der Krampus schaut um's Eck._<sup>translation&nbsp;</sup> 

— Message on greeting cards on _Krampusnacht_

Krampus is an Alpine mountain demon who figures heavily in the December traditions of Central Europe. According to legend, Krampus accompanies St. Nicholas during the early Christmas season. Depending on the story, Krampus is either a regular demon enslaved by St. Nicholas to do the Saint's bidding, or is a demon who willingly and gladly works as St. Nicholas's partner. Krampus acts as the Bad Cop to St. Nicholas's Good Cop, warning and punishing bad children, in contrast to St. Nicholas, who instead rewards good children.

In the Alpine regions, Krampus takes the form of a giant demon covered in goat, ram, or bear fur, his head sporting large horns with a long, slavering tongue often hanging out of his mouth. Depending on the story, Krampus may have chained shackles on his wrists, signifying his enslavement to St. Nicholas. Generally though, Krampus will be wearing several large bells (as a warning to any who hear them that he's coming), along with a large wicker basket and birch rod. If someone has been bad, Krampus will either threaten a beating with his birch rod or actually give one. If his target has been particularly bad, then Krampus stuffs them into his wicker basket, and drags them off to punish them for their crimes. Depending on the story, Krampus will either bring them to St. Nicholas's home, Krampus's own mountain underworld, Hell, twelfth-century Moorish Spain, or simply Scare 'Em Straight and bring them back home.

Traditionally, young men in Southern Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czechia, Switzerland, Croatia, Slovenia, and even Northern Italy dress up as the Krampus during the first two weeks of December, particularly on the evening of December 5, known as _Krampusnacht_, and roam the streets in grand, sweeping parades through town. Often, they will go after adults in the audience who are in on the fun, especially tourists encountering their first "Krampus Parade" or attractive young women. Curiously, despite their fearsome appearance and reputation, the (plural) Krampusi are generally fairly kind to children, generally exempting them from the shenanigans they pull on the adults.

Despite the frightening overtones, Krampus is quite a popular character in the Alpine countries. He brings some harmless "scary" fun to the Christmas season, not unlike what happens at Halloween.

He is also not alone as the companion of St. Nicholas; several other countries have their own similar traditions:

-   Belsnickel, a fur-clad, filthy, bearded man from the Palatinate region of southwestern Germany along the Rhine, the Saarland, and the Odenwald area of Baden-Württemberg.
-   Knecht Ruprecht, a German character who performs a similar role (though more as a stern authority figure than a nasty devil).
-   Lady Perchta, an Alpine female version of Krampus who can either be drop-dead gorgeous or hideously ugly.
-   Père Fouettard (Father Whipper, sometimes localized as Father Flog), a French version usually depicted as a dark-haired and black-wearing Santa Claus who whips misbehaving children.
-   Čert, a Czech and Slovak boogeyman said to kidnap naughty children in a sack and take them to Hell.
-   Zwarte Piet, a Dutch boogeyman said to kidnap naughty children in a sack and take them to Spain. (Which, given the Dutch history with Spain, might as well have been Hell to the Early Modern Dutch.)<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Tonton Macoute, a Haitian boogeyman said to kidnap naughty children in a sack,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  though to where isn't exactly specified.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   The Yule Lads, a group of 13 Icelandic troll-like beings who historically caused mischief during Christmas, but became more Santa Claus-like in modern times.

    Comic Books

-   _Doctor Who Magazine_:
    -   Krampus appears as a species in "Red Christmas." They are a red gaseous species (otherwise looking like typical Krampus) that feed off negative emotions to survive, using a psychic fog to separate people from loved ones and send them into states of panic. They are very weak against bright light, which is revealed when the Doctor used both the sonic screwdriver and the roof light of his TARDIS to disperse their fog.
    -   Amy, Rory, and Mels encounter (and defeat) the Krampus as eight-year-olds in "Imaginary Enemies". However, the version depicted has very little to do with the legends - he is the Evil Counterpart of Santa and a member of the Trickster's Brigade, and he looks like a black-bearded Santa in a colour-reversed white suit with red fur trimming.
-   _Evil Dead 2: Revenge of the Krampus_ is part of the _Evil Dead 2: Revenge of_ series, this one has Ash saving a kid who has been taken by Krampus.

It is currently in Development Hell, however. You can read the first few pages here.
-   Krampus appears in the 2010 story "Grounded" in the erratically published Paul Dini comic _Jingle Belle_. He's introduced lamenting how Santa's "gone soft" and gotten too lenient with putting kids on the "nice" list, which has pretty much put Krampus out of work.
-   In the miniseries _Klaus (Grant Morrison)_, Krampus (rather than being the servant/partner of Santa) is Santa's enemy who feeds on bad children and corrupts things with his mere touch.
-   There is a five-issue comic book series created by Brian Joines and Dean Kotz with Krampus as the main character, appropriately called _Krampus._

    Fan Works 

-   In _Earth-27_, Krampus (or as he used to be called, "Krampos") is a satyr who works for Santa Claus. He's an Adaptational Nice Guy, only really persecuting naughty children—or Nazi officers, apparently.
-   The fanfiction _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ comic series, _Chibi Prussia_, has a Christmas story arc where a young Hungary warns Prussia that Krumpas will come for him because of his naughtiness. Hilarity Ensues as a terrified Prussia tries to defend himself from Krumpas and ends up tackling Germania to the ground as Hungary and Austria have a laugh. It comes to a rather amusing end as the real Krampus passes over punishing Prussia since Germania's already spanking him, then carries off Hungary and Austria for being naughty and scaring Prussia.
-   _J-WITCH Series_: As shown in "A Jolly J-WITCH Xmas", Krampus is a demon who once fed on the souls and flesh of children who were corrupted by negative emotions, until Saint Nicholas and his elf allies sealed him away in an Arctic tomb.
-   The _Invader Zim_ oneshot _Knows if You've Been Naughty_ features Krampus coming after Gaz after she shows some particularly nasty Christmas behavior. He assaults her with a switch beating, as per the tradition, and then proceeds to abduct her to the North Pole, where she's transformed and brainwashed to serve as one of Santa's elves, making presents for nicer children for the rest of her life. In some twists on the original folklore, he's shown not as a demon but as a man who's an inverted Santa Claus, being rail thin and all in black; he notably states that he does _not_ eat naughty children (in fact, he's vegetarian); and he and Santa actually appear to be close friends.
-   Krampus is a semi-popular monster for custom dolls and original characters in the _Monster High_ franchise.
-   Given the nature of _The Guardians of Childhood_ book series and its movie adaptation _Rise of the Guardians_, it's inevitable that there would be many fanfictions/fanarts/ocs based on the Krampus. One of these, _The Sabbat_, features the Krampus as Nicholas St. North's predecessor, as one of the Guardians of the Sabbat. And as the opening of the story shows, he's a dangerous individual.
    -   For similar reasons, many people make fan versions of Krampus for _The Nightmare Before Christmas_.
-   In _Shadowchasers: Ascension_, a minor villain named Victor used a deck that included an Xyz Monster based on the character; Ophelia was the only one who recognized the reference, leading to this exchange:
    
    **Ophelia:** ...but it was a rather scary story, and not too pleasant to tell during the holidays, so the legend of Krampus was rarely mentioned outside of the Alpine countries, while everywhere else, St. Nicholas evolved into jolly old Santa Claus, a guy who would never dream of using such scare tactics.
    
    **Dante:** Maybe it would have been a good idea… A guy like this might have convinced kids to behave more than Santa threatening to leave coal in their stockings.
    
-   In _Undertale_ King Asgore also plays the role of Santa for the monsters. So, in the spirit of the popular grimdark AU Underfell, this blog made Underfell!Asgore as the Krampus.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Astro Monster Holiday_ is a strange film that has Santa and Krampus celebrating Christmas with other characters such as The Queen of the Galaxy, The Queen of the Unicorns, The Dark Lady, and the literal devil.

It stars George Buza as Santa, Rob Archer as Krampus, and William Shatner as the narrator DJ Dan. There are in fact two different Krampuses in this film. One is a transformation some people will undergo when they are deeply enraged during the Christmas Holiday. The other was an evil anti-Christmas demon, who turned out to be a hallucination by a Mall Santa.

-   _Krampus_, a horror-comedy from the director of _Trick 'r Treat_ about The Krampus attacking a Dysfunctional Family who must band together to stop him.
-   _Krampus The Christmas Devil_ is an indie movie released in 2013 about a detective who searches for missing children while dealing with the trauma of when he himself was kidnapped as a child. In this movie, Krampus is Santa Claus's evil brother.

-   _Krampus The Reckoning_ is about a disturbed young girl named Zoe whose "imaginary friend" turns out to be the Krampus, who she uses dolls to summon to kill anyone who she deems "naughty." The twist ending reveals that Zoe is a ghost, with the implication being that the Krampus is just a manifestation of her powers, and not the real one.
-   The Krampus in _Krampus Unleashed_ is trapped in a coal-like "summoning stone" that activates and releases it when exposed to fire. According to the film's lore, St. Nicholas would place small pieces of the stone in the shoes and stockings of his enemies, who would then be slaughtered by the Krampus when they obliviously placed the garments by a fire to dry. The Krampus itself is seemingly nothing more than a mindless killing machine that rips apart and eats anyone that it comes across; it's sucked back into the stone when there's no one left to terrorize, and while it can be killed, this merely results in the summoning stone re-birthing it.
-   _Kranky Klaus_ is a documentary about an Austrian Krampus tradition.
-   Despite being called _Mother Krampus,_ said movie is actually a take on Frau Perchta. It was likely named the way it was due to the prior _Krampus_ movie.

-   _Pagan Warrior:_ After being driven out of his castle by Viking invaders, a Saxon king summons Krampus to defeat the Vikings and regain his castle. This ends badly for all concerned.
-   There is much debate over _Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale_ and whether the antagonist in it is a Bad Santa, a Krampus, or Joulupukki. Given that it is a Finnish film, it is more likely that it is Joulupukki. Note that the characters in the movie always speak of Santa Claus/Joulupukki. The modern Joulupukki is the Finnish version of Santa Claus, usually treated as interchangeable; his name means, nonsensically, "Christmas goat", and by some accounts, this originally referred to a goat accompanying St. Nicholas that sounds very much like Krampus. Returning to the movie, its depiction of "Santa" might have been inspired by Krampus, although in-universe, there are old depictions of "Joulupukki" as being like that. (All save maybe the mildest one (left) seem to be fabrications for the movie.)
-   _Santa Krampus_ is a short indie film by Jerry Williams.
-   _Slay Belles_ stars three women (who for some reason are cosplaying on Christmas) who end up releasing Krampus and have to team up with a very casually dressed Santa to defeat him.

But as he discovers on _Krampusnacht_, Krampus is not bound by human laws, and in this tale, his reputation of going after children is a myth, for children are young and don't understand. Adults, on the other hand, are often guilty of murder and bigotry, and are more deserving of the punishment he brings.
-   In _Pv P_ Krampus becomes Scratch Fury's new Christmas persona in the 2011 Christmas arc.

-   "The Krampus Song" on Newgrounds, done to the tune of "My Favorite Things" from _The Sound of Music_.
-   The author of _Planetary Moe_ made this shonen anime concept doing a twist on the Santa/Krampus dynamic — in this depiction, Santa and Krampus would be portrayed as twin brothers who always inherit their positions from the previous member of their line, Krampus clearly being portrayed in a Dark Is Not Evil manner here. In this particular generation, however, Santa decided to opt out and this made Krampus completely lose it, eventually judging _everyone_ as naughty, turning them into coal and dragging them into his realm. The plotline, apparently, would've been for Santa to take up the mantle again, fight and save his brother and restore order to the holiday. Also, there's buff elves, a Cute Bruiser Mrs. Claus and laser-shooting reindeer. There's a reason a lot of the commenters are disappointed that the anime in question isn't real.

-   The Youtube channel _Krampus Nights_ has a promo video that tells the tale of a naughty child getting taken by the Krampus, followed by a brief history of the creature.

Stan releases him and he kidnaps Steve. In the end Santa kills Krampus with Stan's help but it then turns out that Krampus was good (he punished kids because he cared about them) and Santa was evil (he spoiled kids rotten no matter who was naughty or nice because he makes money off of it), and Jack becomes the new Krampus.

-   The Big Bad of the Christmas Special _Christmas is Here Again_, Krad, is pretty obviously based on the Krampus, given his goblin-like appearance and the fact that he supplied Santa with the coal that the naughty kids recieved, to the point where both the above-mentioned _Isle of Rangoon_ review and Diva's review of the film identify him with the Krampus. Although he's never referred to as such, his name starts with the same first three letters although his name is just "Dark" backwards.

It turns out that there are 2 different children's songs being sung about it in Drusselstein and it can be interpreted that it is actually a merging of Santa Claus and the Krampus.
-   In the _Robot Chicken_ Christmas Special 'X-Mas United', the final twist in that story is that there's no way Santa Claus can be The Nerd's biological father because he's sterile...and also that The Nerd's mother had also had sex with the Krampus, specifically noting that the Krampus convinced her to do it without a condom. The Nerd, unable to accept that the Krampus is his biological father, returns home and says to his stepfather that as far as he's concerned, he's his real father, much to the stepfather's irritation and the Krampus's disappointment.
