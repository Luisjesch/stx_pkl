He could at least have taken it out of the bag first.

**Archdeacon Robert:** Someone's coming. Quick! It might be the area Dean. Eat it!  
**Adam:** What? Come on.  
**Robert:** Eat it in the name of Church unity. Eat it. Eat it all!

Done something unspeakable with something edible? Then there's only one way to destroy the evidence: eat it, or at least make someone else do it. Eating Solves Everything after all.

Often played for laughs, especially if the evidence is something that no-one would normally consider edible.

If the evidence is a human body, things become rather more morally awkward, and may result in the body being Fed to Pigs instead.

Sister-trope to Swallow the Key. May induce I Ate WHAT?! afterward.

Not to be confused with Feed the Mole.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the manga of _Death Note_ it's explained that Light eats the killer scrap of paper he used to kill Higuchi with.
-   One chapter of _Franken Fran_ had a man attempt to serve his murdered daughter to the guests at her birthday dinner. Unfortunately, Fran instantly recognized the human meat for what it was, being a surgeon.
-   In _The Garden of Sinners_, when Araya Souren asks how Lio Shirazumi will hide the body of his first murder, he responds by EATING THE BODY IN **THREE HOURS**.
-   Used in _K-On!_ when the club is allowed to sell their teacher's guitar, Ritsu attempts to keep most of the money from the girls by telling her it sold for much less than what was paid. The teacher then asks for the receipt, which has the real amount on it. Ritsu tries to eat the receipt before finally handing it over.
-   Happens in at least one instance during the second _Lupin III_ series. A small time thief actually managed to steal a rare diamond, but was caught. Just before his capture, he swallowed the diamond so it couldn't be found. While the authorities searched for it, he... retrieved it and hid it in the cistern of the toilet in his prison cell, but never got a chance to take it with him from the high security prison before he was released. The elaborate scheme for the episode revolves around Lupin and company breaking into the prison to retrieve the gem themselves.

    -   When Kodachi gets a photo of a Not What It Looks Like scene between her and Ranma, she makes hundreds of copies and scatters them everywhere. Ranma proceeds to catch and eat them all.

Note that this was less to hide how terrible it tasted from her (she was the first person to find out), but more from desperation to return things to the way they were, so that he wouldn't have to reveal whether he loved Akane or Ukyo better. Before that, he devoured every okonomiyaki that Ukyo made with it, but that was to protect her from eating them out of pride, and potentially making herself terribly sick.
