"Here to lend a helping fin!"

In fiction, dolphins will be portrayed primarily as heroic and helpful creatures. They're a marketable species of hero, partly because they're cute and partly because of real-life stories of dolphins saving human lives, either by guiding them to shore, fending off sharks or helping them to remain afloat until help arrives.

Sometimes overlaps with Friendly, Playful Dolphin, or Sapient Cetaceans, or both. Compare Warm-Hearted Walrus, Sweet Seal, and Playful Otter. Contrast Devious Dolphins.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The titular hero of _Ajooba_ was cast into rough seas as a baby by the villain who murdered his parents, and would've drowned if not for a bottlenose dolphin saving him and bringing Ajooba to a nearby fishing village. In the film's events, the adult Ajooba will occasionally seek help from his old dolphin friend, usually as a messenger; and late into the film the same dolphin managed to summon a Giant Crab to save the hero who's about to be executed.

    Literature

-   _Venus Among The Fishes_ is about Coral and her brother Snapper who are sent on a journey to save their pod from orca attacks.

It is also strongly implied that the same dolphin discouraged Lupus from deliberately leaving behind another diver who had been trapped by a giant octopus, though in fairness to Lupus he had a good reason for wanting the trapped person to die. The same scene is also in the Live-Action TV adaptation.

-   _Dolphin Trilogy_: In _Destiny and the Dolphins_, John, Vinca, and Syn have been captured by diamond thieves who plan to torture John, rape Vinca and Syn, and kill all three of them as revenge for the fight they put up earlier.

Liir soldiers are called "Black Swimmers" and are _never_ permitted to interact with civilian Liir, lest their murderous tendencies corrupt the entire species. As far as the planet-bound Liir are concerned, the Black Swimmers are all dead to them. They hold a funeral service for each Liir who signs up to join the fleet. And as for the Suul'Ka themselves, the Eldritch Abomination Abusive Percursors everyone lives in quiet fear of? They're Liir Great Elders gone mad with power and the fear of death.

    Real Life 

-   It has become increasingly popular in non-fictional media to portray dolphins as Always Chaotic Evil, due to cases of dolphins killing their own young, but in practice it is unclear what percentage of dolphins are like that, etc. At the very least, it should be regarded as depending on the individual dolphin. Dolphins have also been known to rescue humans, after all.
    -   One of reasons why dolphins are so popular may be exactly that similarity to humans in that they are capable of doing very... erm, humane deeds, as well as things completely opposite of these.
    -   It also helps that things that seem morally reprehensible to us are, when it comes to animals, practically always a case of Blue-and-Orange Morality. Actions such as eating your own (or a rival's) offspring are present in many animals, for instinctual reasons we can't always understand easily. When it comes down to it, dolphins are still one of the select wild species in which empathy and playful behavior are consistently observed, including species other than their own - things such as going to great lengths to help stranded fish, whales, or even humans. The idea that dolphins are in any way more "immoral" than any other animal seems to be based on the higher expectations people have for dolphins, but they are still wild animals. Hard as it is to reconcile the image of Flipper the friendly dolphin playing with kids and saving stranded people from wrecks with the same animal that will eat its young, aggressively fight other sea creatures and sometimes even "rape" them, they are still wild animals, and some of their actions will inevitably come off as savage and ruthless to humans.
-   It's been suggested that the Real Life stories of the Heroic dolphin pushing humans to land or somewhere they can be rescued, is a selection effect. The situation may be a Fridge Horror version of the Friendly, Playful Dolphin: the Dolphin wants to play with him, and pushes him in any direction. The ones who live to tell the tale are pushed toward safety (just by chance). The ones who don't, aren't. There are, however, reported cases of dolphins deliberately doing things clearly intended as life-saving, including chasing off sharks to defend others.
-   Inverted in the recent case of a dolphin coming to a human diver for help.
-   Pelorus Jack was a wild New Zealand Risso's dolphin who was famous for escorting ships through the notorious French pass from 1888 until his supposed death from old age in 1912. After a (potentially drunken) sailor abord the _SS Penguin_ shot at him, Jack became protected under New Zealand law, making him the first individual sea creature to achieve such a feat. According to legend, Jack no longer helped the _Penguin_ after the incident which led to its shipwreck in 1909. In his honor, New Zealand had two military mascot bulldogs named after him aboard the HMS _New Zealand_ in World War I, and since 1989 Jack has been the mascot for the Cook Strait InterIslander ferry service.
-   Moko, a wild New Zealand bottlenose dolphin, was hailed as a hero for leading two trapped whales to safety.
-   While they are apex predators and thus prone to a bit more of the Predators Are Mean trope when it comes to public perception, Orca arguably fit this trope better than a majority of other dolphin species. Pods are extremely protective of one another, they've been known to team-up with humans to hunt other whales, and despite having more than enough intelligence and strength to do so, there has never been a confirmed case of an orca hunting a human; even the recent cases of orcas ramming and/or sinking boats off the Iberian coast are theorized by at least some biologists to be instances of overblown play behavior. All cases of orca killing a human are captive individuals with dubious mental health or the deaths were accidents. And yes, despite their nickname of "Killer Whale", orca are indeed the largest species of true dolphin.
    -   In a case of society changing, a pod of Australian killer whales would regularly help whalers to capture prey, the whalers leaving the carcass overnight so the orcas could eat their fill.
-   In the summer of 2023, video surfaced (no pun intended) of a young orca approaching a group of boaters for help in freeing an adult orca, presumably its mother, who was entangled in a fishing net. After a rescue team was called to the scene, the calf guided them to the trapped orca's location, allowing them to free it. The video can be seen here.
