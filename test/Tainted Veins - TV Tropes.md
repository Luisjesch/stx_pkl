_"He has veins on his forehead now, which is the official_ Star Trek _code for "This poor bastard is in for a horribly painful transformation and/or death." Seriously, if you are ever yourself in a_ Star Trek _episode and you see this happening to yourself,_ turn your phaser on yourself. _There is no hope if you have a veiny head unless you are an alien or a main cast member. Just put yourself out of your own misery."_

_Sometimes I feel I've got to (dum dum) run away I've got to (dum dum) get away from the pain that you drive into the heart of me..._

In general, the tendency of people suffering some sort of abnormal condition to develop highly visible, off-color veins all over their body or near the distressed areas.

Might be due to catching a bite from someone/thing infected with The Virus, or as a manifestation of a villain's Red Right Hand after willingly succumbing to The Dark Side or The Corruption. It's also possible if the character is suffering a Super-Power Meltdown, Power Degeneration, or as a side effect to taking too much Psycho Serum. A vampire, werewolf or other supernatural critter hit with Depleted Phlebotinum Shells inducing a burning reaction (or even just partial sun exposure/blood starvation) may develop Tainted Veins because their glamour is failing. Special mention goes to zombie bites for always creating nasty necrotic veins wherever they bit.

Expect characters with a Healing Factor (or with friends possessing Healing Hands and or a Magic Antidote) to quickly and neatly reverse the appearance of these veins.

See also Volcanic Veins for when they glow. Compare Vein-o-Vision, which is where a character has a power that makes them see the world this way. May involve a Wound That Will Not Heal.

This is a Justified Trope (Tropes Are Not Bad): There are toxins that cause venous thrombosis (clotting of blood in veins) which can make surface veins visible and dark — especially if the clotting is in deep tissue in an affected limb.

-   A Downplayed example in _Naruto_: activating the Byakugan technique causes the veins around the user's eyes to noticably bulge due to increased blood flow to the eyes.
-   Owning to his tendency to forcibly insert himself right into the bloodstream and organs of his opponents to extract 'information', Armisael in _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ causes this to both the Eva he's attacking and the pilot of the Eva. Let's just say that Rei's encounter with Armisael looked incredibly painful.
-   Kurumi from _School-Live!_ gains these on her right arm, the right side of her neck, and a bit of the right side of her face, after her close brush with zombification. It is unsure if this will be permanent however, as she's treated quickly but there are signs the treatment wasn't permanent.
-   These have a tendency to show up whenever someone's using their powers in _Snow White and Seven Dwarfs_. With it being a series about being Blessed with Suck, they're generally not a good sign.

-   _Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves_: Near the end of the film, Holga is mortally stabbed by Sofina's blade. To visually indicate that a wound from a Red Wizard's blade is so fatal it can't be healed by regular magic, veins around the wound begin to darken and spread.
-   The vampires in _Interview with the Vampire_ had visible veins on their faces, too, but that was as much due to their creepily transparent porcelain white skin as it was to their veins being full of freshly drunk blood.

        -   If you look closely, you can see that Hela has faint but visible black veins on her shoulders, forehead and around her eyes and jawline.

        -   When Thor and Loki are zapped by the shock devices (which likely contain a neurotoxin) for long enough, they develop purple veins.
