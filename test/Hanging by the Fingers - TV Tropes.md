"Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?"

A character is holding onto a ledge or rope by their fingers far above a rocky chasm or atop a building. One by one, each finger loses its grip. To ramp up the tension, the ledge or rope may be wet, or rain is falling. Or someone or something may peel the fingers off slowly, one by one...

The trope is often paired with a villain at the ledge stomping on their hands or peeling the finger off. When there isn't a villain around, another hero or their ally will try to grasp their hands.

If they do fall, their death isn't certain if they are a hero, especially if they are "wearing" Plot Armor. If they need to survive for plot purposes, they may grab a vine/gutter/drainpipe in mid-air or land on a conveniently-present soft surface (bales of hay in a Period Piece or a pile of garbage bags in modern stories).

Villains who are dangling by their fingers near the end of a story (when they have no Plot Armor) may lose their grip and plummet to their death, giving a satisfying moral about how "crime does not pay". Villains in kids' movies have a high propensity to lose their grip and fall to their doom, because Moral Guardians find it more acceptable than having a scene where the hero stabs the villain ten times.

If the creator wants to do Fanservice, they may show a female character from below with a gratuitous Panty Shot. If Played for Comedy or Played for Drama or whatever have you, the rescuer may themselves fall and have to be grabbed by an even stronger person.
