_"I see no difference between things and people."_

The Sociopath is a character with a marked Lack of Empathy, a self-centered disposition, a disregard for social norms and ethics, a propensity for using charm, lies, manipulation or outright violence to get his way, a reckless and impulsive streak, and a heart black as pitch. They show no remorse and can describe gruesome events in a nonchalant manner that many find creepy. The Trope Namer is an old edition of the DSM which used the term to refer to a personality disorder now known as Anti-Social Personality disorder.

Sociopaths are frequently candidates for Complete Monster, as by definition they have no remorse or even the capability for it. They are sometimes given a Freudian Excuse, usually involving horrific abuse that conditions them to believe that Humans Are Bastards. From a psychological perspective, however, sociopathy does not have any better reason to be there than any other sickness (although negative experiences with other human beings will change the way it manifests). See UsefulNotes.Lack Of Empathy for more detailed information.

While The Sociopath is often associated with other Above Good and Evil personalities, many examples with morals also exist, but they are more likely to suffer from Moral Myopia, or subscribe to a self-centered moral code.
