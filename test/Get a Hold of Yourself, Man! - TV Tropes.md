_"When a man strays from the right path, a kind man needs the courage to raise his fist and correct him."_

The hero has just gone off the deep end under stress. Proving himself to be Not So Above It All, he grows increasingly hysterical, mean, unresponsive or (w)angsty, at a time when his team needs his unaffected ability the most. How do you fix him?

With human-centered Percussive Maintenance, of course!

His Sidekick, Distaff Counterpart, right-hand man or woman, love interest (especially the ladies of the Tsundere or Broken Bird kind) or superior jolts him back to his senses with a sharp slap, a straight-up punch to the face, a shake to both shoulders or an Angry Collar Grab, and occasionally a retort for him to get his head out of his ass already (see entry title for the archetypal one). The shame-faced hero says something along the lines of "Thanks. I needed that." Less appreciatively he'll say "Not even my dad hits me!", but will eventually calm down.

Alternatively in a program wanting to limit the potential for imitation violence, a glass of cold water may be used to bring the subject back to their senses.

Might overlap with the Dope Slap; also compare Zen Slap, when a Zen master does this to their disciple for the purpose of enlightening them. May also be used on a Hysterical Woman — even by a man. Similar in spirit, but not so much in execution, to Don't Make Me Take My Belt Off!. Compare with Quit Your Whining, in which it is verbal, but this trope can be used to spice it up. If you need to lay a full-on beating to snap someone out of it, see Beat the Curse Out of Him. A form of Tough Love.

The _MythBusters_ tested a myth based on this trope and found that — at least when dealing with someone who's merely tired and frazzled — a slap to the face _does_ help the slapped person regain his or her focus. Apparently the surprise and minor pain of a slap kicks in the "fight or flight" response and temporarily boosts adrenaline and related hormones. Nevertheless, it should be applied with extreme caution, as even a successful instance can easily go wrong and turn hysteria into aggression rather than concentration - often aggression against the slapper, obviously. Furthermore, smacking someone when you don't know what's wrong with them can easily do more harm than good.

    Fan Works 

-   _Alternate Tail Series_:
    -   At the start of the Edolas arc, Gajeel punches Pantherlily to snap him out of the Heroic BSoD from failing to stop Edolas from taking Fairy Tail.
    -   Played for Laughs later in the same arc, with Levy slapping Gajeel when he falls into "The-End-Is-Nigh" rant after seeing the Earthland and Edolas versions of Mira fighting each other.
-   Gohan had to punch Goku in the cheek in an attempt to get Goku to snap out of being frozen in terror after Vegeta went Super Saiyan 3 in _Goku's Wish: The Return of Broly_. Subverted in that it doesn't quite work.
-   _The Child of Love_: In chapter 9 Misato is trying to get Shinji moving to go with her and save Asuka, but the sudden shock has paralized him, so she resorts to slap him to get him focused:
    
    **Misato:** "Grab your stuff off the floor and put it on in the car! I told you, there's no time to waste!"  
    **Shinji:** "Will you at least tell me what's going on!!!!?"  
    **Misato:** (losing patience) "ASUKA'S GONNA GIVE BIRTH SOON!!!!!! Now hurry up, Shinji-kun!"  
    **Shinji:** "No...what the...?"  
    _He stands there trembling._  
    **Misato:** "Hurry UP!"  
    **Shinji:** "I..."  
    _Misato slaps him. Shinji doesn't even flinch._  
    **Misato:** You're supposed to be a man now. ACT like a man! Come with me, NOW!"  
    _He then grabs his clothes off the floor, and Misato half-drags him to the car, where Kaji is waiting for them._
    
-   _The One I Love Is..._: After killing the last Angel Shinji feels more depressed and lonelier than ever and he implies he wants to commit suicide. Misato slaps him and points out that if he dies all hurt his friends went through and all sacrifices they did will be meaningless.
    
    _"Why am I the one who always stays alive? Why do people have to sacrifice themselves for me? I'm not worth it! My life is not worth so much pain. I should have been the one to die. Maybe there's still time to put an end to the pain."_  
    _"Shinji!"_  
    _I gasped as I felt Misato's hand hitting my cheek._  
    _"Don't you ever say that, Shinji! Don't even dare think about it! If you die now, then all the sacrifice and suffering your friends went through would become meaningless! Don't disgrace them!"_  
    _The words hit me even harder then her hand. I had never thought about things this way._
    
-   In _Dragon Age: The Crown of Thorns_, the The Wise Prince protagonist applies a very strong backhand to Faren, the dwarven commoner, in order to snap him out of a serious case of shut-down brain that the latter ended up in after being shoved into his worst nightmare by the Sloth Demon. He follows it with a Cooldown Hug of epic proportions. Big Brother Mentor indeed.
    
    "There is no blood on your hands!" (and he was speaking literally)
    
-   _Evangelion 303_: In chapter 8 Shinji flips out after seeing Asuka's war plane crashing down and he loses control of his own plane. Gendo's reaction was quoting the line almost verbatim.

-   In _Fail to the King!_, Almaz is subjected to this trope _twice_: Once in Chapter one to snap him out of his three-day long Heroic BSoD, and again in a later chapter to prevent another from surfacing in the middle of an invasion. Both played largely for laughs, naturally - this is a Disgaea fic after all.
-   _Rise of the Minisukas_: Shiki starts losing it when Shinji is kidnapped by an Angel. Leader's quick slap snaps Shiki out of it and lets her focus on their "search, rescue and annihilate" mission.
    
    Shiki shouts in an uncharacteristic display of raw anguish, snapping Leader out of her shell shock. Leader slaps Shiki out of her state and stares her in the eye.  
    "Anta Baka!" Shiki blinks and nods, her face now a visage of vengeful fury.
    
-   In _The Second Try_, Asuka delivers this trope almost word for word to Shinji in chapter 2, thankfully without the slapping, when he seems too downcast to even try to take care of himself.

Rainbow Dash responds by smacking her, telling her to never belittle herself like that again, and giving a Rousing Speech that pulls Scootaloo back to normal and enables her to help Dash destroy the woebeghoul.
-   In _Post Nuptials_, Twilight floors Shining Armor with a punch to the face when, in the midst of a Heroic BSoD, he considers canceling the wedding.

-   In _White Devil of the Moon_, Nanoha's in the middle of a Heroic BSoD after finally confirming that she is the resurrected Princess Serenity, that her past life was just one big colossal failure, that the Senshi's sacrifices were in vain because Serenity killed herself in grief, that this is could have been avoided if Queen Serenity did better in teaching Princess Serenity and that all of these memories are driving her to the point where she isn't sure where Serenity ends and she starts. Fate solves this problem by making her feelings known and kissing her.
-   In _Mega Man: Defender of the Human Race_, Roll does this to Mega in episode 11, slapping him and lecturing him back to his senses—though it takes more than that to fully convince him.
-   In the _Darkwing Duck_ / _DuckTales (1987)_ Death Fic _Two Worlds, One Loved One_, Scrooge clouts Darkwing with his cane, sensing that he's thinking about giving up, and scolds him for even considering dishonoring Launchpad's memory by not continuing with his good work.

-   In _Shatterheart_, Syaoran has been refusing to eat or to leave his room for days. Kurogane tries to shake him out of it, which triggers memories of being tortured to death, causing a screaming panic attack.

-   _Soul Eater: Troubled Souls_: Once Crona experiences a Heroic BSoD at a shocking revelation, Ragnarok puts his foot down and brings Crona out of it with this speech.
    
    **Ragnarok**: Alright, Crona, you listen to me, and you listen to me good. Get up. On your feet. After all that stuff we talked about, don't turn into a hypocrite. I ain't scared no more, I'm ready for this! You shouldn't be either. I'm with you! Albarn's with you! Hell, if everyone else was here, I'm sure they'd have pom-poms at the ready too! So what if you're not completely human? I'm not either! You gotta learn not to take everyone's crap at face value. It's like what Albarn is saying – you're you! Can't anybody change that!
    
-   In _Ace Attorney_ fanfic Turnabout Blue Earth _Iris_ of all people gives one to Apollo after he learns that his client is responsible for murder, although not the one she's accused of, and he refuses to continue defending her, despite case being far from over.
-   In the 21st chapter of _Old West_, Beans has to slap Rango when he's angsting over the upcoming court with the Big Bad.

-   _Simple Gifts_: Watson contracts influenza, complete with high fever, just before Christmas. Holmes splashes the delirious doctor with cold water to startle him back to normal, and Watson promptly deals him a surprisingly painful left hook with his injured arm.
-   _Remnant Inferis: DOOM_:
    -   Downplayed. When Ruby was having a Heroic BSoD after they get trapped in Hell, the Slayer lightly taps her on the back of the head to snap her out of it, though it still hurt as much as an actual punch to the back of the head would.
    -   Inverted and defied. Taiyang was absolutely pissed at the Slayer for dragging his daughters into Hell (figuratively and literally) and tries to punch him in the face to calm himself down, only for the Slayer to catch his punch and respond in kind with his own. Qrow even finds it bemusing that the Slayer didn't let Tai punch him.
-   _Funeral for a Flash_: After being told that his uncle Barry Allen did not survive the Crisis after all, Wally West is panicking and babbling incoherently until Hal Jordan shouts his name loudly to calm him down and get him to listen.
-   _The Flash Sentry Chronicles_: In _The Knight of Friendship_, Flash goes through a Heroic BSoD after losing to Cold Steel and failing to finally become a Royal Knight. When he refuses to listen to Twilight when she finds him in the mountains and tries to get him to come back with her, arguing that she doesn't understand all the struggles he has had to go through to get to where he is now, she gets his attention by angrily throwing snowballs at him, instead of one of her usual speeches on friendship, and shouts he isn't acting like the Flash she knows. The results of this are zig-zagged. This initially only makes Flash madder until he tackles her and pins her to the floor screaming in her face to stop it. While he has her pinned though, he sees Twilight sobbing and she gives an Anguished Declaration of Love to him which gets him back to normal.
-   _Liquid's Resident Evil_: In _Downfall_, Claire finds herself dealing with a hysterical, panicking Sherry after saving her from a Licker.

-   _Read the Fine Print (Evangelion)_: Shinji starts screaming hysterically when a demoness shows up in their apartment, so Asuka slaps the back of his head to shut him up and calm him down. It works.
-   At one point _Mortal Kombat Khronicles_, Jade has to do this to Queen Sindel, while the latter is too wrapped up in her past failures to protect her daughter and realm to act on the situation at hand.
-   _Arc Corp_: Chapter 47 has Blake follow up kissing Jaune with this in order to mentally shock him enough to stop his complete forced transformation into an anomaly. Downplayed in that the kiss by itself brought him back to his senses and she knew this: the slap was because this was the second time he ordered her to abandon him and contact his family to Mercy Kill him, and she hates how little he and everyone else values his life.
-   _The Roboutian Heresy_: In "The Cadian Apocalypse" Ciaphas Cain becomes the first, and possibly only person in history to deliver this trope to a Custodes after the shockwave from the Emperor's death puts them over the Despair Event Horizon. Being a Custodes, the only reason he doesn't break his hand is because he had some bionic augmentation in that hand. By some miracle, this _works_.
    
    **Cain:** "Are you going to be the first Custodes ever to be executed for cowardice ?! Custodes or not, you are still a soldier of the Imperium, and I am still a Commissar. If you don't get your head back into the fight so help me I will shoot you where you stand! Is that understood ?!"

-   U2's "Stuck In a Moment You Can't Get Out Of" is all about the narrator doing this to a friend.

    Pinball 

-   In _The Lord of the Rings_, Gandalf sometimes speaks this trope's name word for word when the ball enters Paths of the Dead.

    X corpsing? SEND FOR THE MAN!
    
-   MsChif did this to Ministry Of Hate Stablemate and Gateway Heavyweight Champion Nikki Strychnine, to get him to stop thinking about "love" and focus on defending his title.

    _(Loyal Royal Advisor backhands him)_  
    **Miller:** Thanks, I needed that.
    
    -   And it's done again at the end of the Intermission.
    
    **Gonzo:** Intermission!? Wait a minute!! Why wasn't I told about this?! This is an outrage!! OOF!! Thanks, I needed that.  
    **Rizzo:** Don't mention it.
    
-   _The Muppet Show_: In the Hal Linden episode, since Statler and Waldorf have been saying for years that they could put on a better show, Kermit lets them be the hosts. Statler and Waldorf then cancel all the regular acts.
    
    **Link:** Oh, we have been cancelled! Do you realize that we've been cancelled? Oh, no! We have been ca-a-ancel-el-el-ed...! _\[Miss Piggy slaps him across the face.\]_  
    **Miss Piggy:** Will you try and act like a grown-up? It's only for one show.
    
-   On an episode of the short lived MTV series _Super Adventure Team_, Chief Engineer Head literally slapped Dr. Criswell blind trying to get him to snap out of his funk.

    Radio 

-   Parodied in the _Hamish and Dougal_ episode "Trapped!":
    
    **Hamish:** Help! We're trapped between floors! Help!  
    **Dougal:** Hamish, you're getting hysterical.  
    (_SLAP! SLAP! SLAP!_)  
    **Hamish:** Well, don't just stand their applauding, do something!  
    **Dougal:** All right!  
    (_SLAP! SLAP! SLAP!_)  
    **Hamish:** Ow!  
    **Dougal:** Now, control yourself. Or next time it's the face.
    
-   _X Minus One_: In episode eighty-three, adapted from Theodore Sturgeon's "A Saucer Of Loneliness", Jason Bernaides slaps Janet Boyce to prevent her from killing herself.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_
    -   The Player's Handbook 3 for 4th Edition includes Skill Powers, such as "Snap Out of it", which is pretty much this trope.
        
        _A smack across the face brings your ally back to his or her senses._
        
    -   _Dungeon_ magazine #28 adventure "Night of Fear". Goddle is one of the NPCs trapped in Crellar's Trading Post with the doppelganger. At some point he will panic and become hysterical until someone slaps him.
-   _Pathfinder_ has a magical club (from the Inner Sea Temples sourcebook) known as the Censuring Placard. Though it can be used to remove status buffs from enemies, it's just as effective at breaking Charm Person effects on allies.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Fairly common among the Imperial Guard. When they're not being executed for cowardice, that is.
    -   Orks have a similar rule where morale tests can be passed by the boss dealing a few good thwacks to his underlings. It tends to be lethal more often than not, but orks aren't awfully concerned about it.

     Web Animation 

-   _Helluva Boss_: When Colin begins freaking out that the C.H.E.R.U.B. have accidentally killed a human, Keenie promptly slaps him and tells him to get a hold of himself.

    Real Life 

-   During the Sicily campaign, General George S. Patton slapped a soldier suffering from shell shock in two separate incidents. One was later found to be suffering from malaria, the other was Just Following Orders after repeatedly requesting to stay with his unit. It almost ended Patton's career, proving that this isn't a good idea to try for real. As a side note, the soldier Patton slapped later said, "He was probably pretty well worn out himself." Combat can do strange things to people. Patton's popularity and effectiveness as a battle commander saved him. All the same, Patton's boss ordered him to apologize. It doesn't work if it is "shell shock" (PTSD), either. Anyone who's been in the Armed Forces can tell you that, combat experience or not. A person that far gone has usually spent themselves keeping a hold for as long as they have. This was parodied during the extensive _Patton_ movie pastiche in _The Simpsons_ episode "Bart the General". Bart (the "Patton" of the parody) does it, but just like actual Patton he gets scolded for it, this time by Grampa Abe (as the superior officer of the parody)
    
    **Grampa:** You can push them out of a plane, you can march them off a cliff, you can send them off to die on some God-forsaken rock, but for some reason you can't slap them.
    
-   In some sects of Zen Buddhism, a monk walks the room during meditation sessions with a light, flat stick. When a meditating monk loses their focus because they starts to get tired or fall asleep, they will lean forward to get a light slap between the shoulder blades with the stick, which triggers the reaction to give the adrenaline to make them fully awake again, to be truly present-minded.
