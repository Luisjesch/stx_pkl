A Queer Establishing Moment is the moment when a character is revealed to be LGBTQ+.

In older works, this was often Subtext, as taboos around the topic made it harder for queer characters to be too apparent in media, especially with the The Hays Code. However, plenty of media is willing to be more open, explicit, and even casual about the topic, and has been for quite a long time.

This moment can come either as a clear moment when a character says something such as Sorry, I'm Gay or mentioning an Incompatible Orientation, or more subtle variations such as pointedly not denying attraction to someone of the same gender. Some moments can lead to a Trans Audience Interpretation if the moment remains only as subtext. The reveal can turn into a Wham Line if it has significant ramifications to the plot.

This trope can overlap with Coming-Out Story if said story is not the main focus of the work. See also LGBT Awakening, when the character in question first realizes their gender or sexuality, and Bi-Wildered for characters who might be confused about a reveal of queerness.

Compare Word of Gay for when a creator confirms a character's orientation or identity outside the context of the story, though it remains ambiguous In-Universe. Examples may use Adaptational Sexuality. Compare and contrast Ambiguously Gay and Ambiguously Bi, and Alcohol-Induced Bisexuality, which may overlap if the moment is left as subtext. This trope, however, is usually quite confirmed in canon.

The resolution of this was after the battle in Wano was over, and Yamato said there was no mixed-bathing, followed by two frames of the hot springs: one with the girls, including Kiku, and one with the boys, including Yamato, confirming that he's a trans man.

On top of that, she was nearing puberty and angsted about the possibility of looking like her father (who is a huge, manly guy). Following a heated argument with him, she noticed that she was starting to grow facial hair, which caused an immense mental shock due to her dysphoria. All of these factors combined caused her to have a fatal heart attack. As she died, her father cried out "Masao", which is revealed to be Lily's deadname.

        -   Speaking of Johnny, there's multiple indicators throughout the game that he's not straight, either. The most obvious example is a conversation you can trigger if you go to Dicky Twister, a gay strip club:
            
            **Johnny:** Huh, last time I was here I was with Kerry. This Latino hunk gave us a lapdance. Cheeks so smooth I could almost see my own reflection.
            
            **V:** I thought you prefer girls.

After receiving a pep talk from both Goldlewis and Ky, Bridget finally gets to courage to stand up and declare herself a girl.
-   _Ikenfell_ features a Cast Full of Gay, with some needing no explanation (for example Petronella and Ima are nonbinary and openly use they/them and Ze/Zir pronouns respectively; Gilda openly comments on how attractive she find other girls). That said, this trope still comes up a few times:
    -   The only confirmation Rook (who's masc presenting and uses he/him pronouns) is nonbinary is a flashback where he asks Safina not to call him dude.
    -   Ibn Oxley and Bax are shown to be close but aren't confirmed as a couple until Bax makes a Love Confession and gives Ibn a Cooldown Hug after the Final Boss fight.

One of the items is an emote that bares a direct reference to _Brokeback Mountain_, a gay romantic drama about two cowboys.

    -   K'Sante debuted in 2022, and unlike previous examples was very quickly established as gay with his introduction video, which establishes his romance and falling-out with another man — a hunter named Tope — with their relationship informing a major story beat in K'Sante's backstory.
-   _The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories_ uses a Bait-and-Switch. It teases J.J and Emily as a lesbian couple, but the actual twist is that J.J is a trans girl.

-   From _Overwatch_:

    -   While there were subtle hints shown earlier, the cutscene after you complete the Taurus Temple reveals that Jun is gay and Tatsuya is bisexual. Tatsuya is asked to pick which of his friends he's interested in, and Jun is the Gay Option. If you choose that, Lisa is stunned and feels quite awkward to find out he swings that way. This has an effect in gameplay, as Jun and Tatsuya get a joint contact, and the Tatsuya/Lisa joint contact is lost for the rest of the game. No, the two options do not function the same way.
-   _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_: During one of Ciri's playable flashbacks, she can respond to a question about if she's attracted to the stable boy who befriended/saved her, by confirming she prefers women.

The issue is how her grief over the deaths of her parents is being exploited by the villains, and how Blake's platonic faith in her old friend helps bring her back from the edge.
    -   While discussing with Weiss whether they should protect Atlas or Mantle, May Marigold says her activism in Mantle caused her Atlesian parents to disown her as a son. In response, May made it clear their _daughter_ was disowning them in turn.

At the time of publication she was non-binary but beginning to get more accustomed to being referred to as female. Xan being a trans woman then sticks for the rest of the comic.
