He majored in evil at the University of Yellow Peril.

**Penny:** Your "arch-enemy"?  
**Sheldon:** Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr. Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spider-Man. The Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel... You know, it's amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate schools should do a better job of screening those people out.

Science created the atom bomb, it unleashes monsters, it angers the gods — Science Is Bad. As a corollary to this, intelligence in media is often used for evil, or belongs to the Mad Scientist.

At least half of the characters in Comic Books whose names begin with "Doctor" are evil. Even the good Doctors are often weird, being prone to mad science, a blind pursuit of forbidden knowledge, or proving their critics wrong.

Actual practicing _medical doctors_ are usually exempt from the evil title, probably because it's hard not to get behind a surgeon or doctor who actively works at saving people's lives, even if they're a jerk. Those who aren't in a Medical Drama tend to get less slack on this, though. In a nutshell, it's a mitigating factor, not an exception. (See "Mad Doctor".)

Interestingly, "Professors" aren't evil nearly as often as doctors, though Professor Blackhearts are not unheard of; this can be explained by the fact that Professor is associated with teaching, wisdom and a scholarly lifestyle (attributes of The Mentor), whereas Doctor seems to imply hands-on experience.

Notably enough, it's actually possible to get a doctorate in the study of evil. The field is called _Ponerology_, although very few universities actually offer such a degree. _Definitely_ issued by the Academy of Evil.

Compare Mad Scientist, which is often synonymous with this, as is Evil Genius. When they're Not That Kind of Doctor, there's overlap with Aristocrats Are Evil, in that the _title_ is an indicator.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  The Dr. Jerk may or may not be this, but is almost always a medical doctor who is a Jerkass. If they had a medical license but lost it due to ethics violations, they had a Doctor's Disgraceful Demotion. If they switch sides in a conflict for pragmatic reasons, they may become Doctor von Turncoat.

Dentists and psychiatrists are technically doctors, but see Depraved Dentist and Psycho Psychologist for examples of when _they_ turn evil or insane.

And yes, the trope title can be abbreviated as M.A.D.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Black Butler_:
    -   The manga has a doctor who seems relatively normal and kind. He made prosthetic limbs for circus performers who had lived on the streets before being rescued by Baron Kelvin. Nice, right? Sure, until we learn that those wonderfully crafted prosthetic limbs were made from bones. Bones of _children_ that were captured and kept in cages until more bones were needed. When Ciel learned this he was NOT happy.
    -   In the anime, one of the people behind the Jack the Ripper case is Doctor Angelina Durless. You know, Madam Red.
-   The Doctor from _Black Cat_. Evil. Although technically his superpower is healing (e.g. reattaching limbs), he's much more interested in the pursuit of knowledge, to the point where he's perfectly happy to conduct human experiments and attempt to vivisect a little girl.
-   In _Cage of Eden_, the closest thing the series has to a Big Bad is Takashi Nishikori, the doctor who holds the Pyramid group in thrall with a combination of threats and psychological tricks. He gained power in the first place by spreading a disease, and then only giving the cure to those who swore loyalty to him. Except for the previous leader and said leader's daughter. Those he watched die. And it turns out he isn't even a real doctor.
-   The viewer is assured that Big Bad Doctor Muraki from _Descendants of Darkness_ is a real doctor, and he is occasionally seen doing doctor-type things... when he isn't committing murder, rape, and tormenting the main characters.
    -   One of the doctor-like things he does is run a black-market organ-trading ring on a cruise liner. Another is encourage the cloning research of a protégé of his grandfather's... by killing women and cutting off locks of their hair for samples.
-   _Doctor Slump_: the titular doctor, Senbei Norimaki, not only has created Arale, but also creates lots of strange inventions which usually backfire in some funny way. Then, you have his enemy, Dr. Mashirito, who focuses on creating robots strangely named _Caramel Men_.
-   Dragon Ball:
    -   Doctor Gero of _Dragon Ball Z_. Evil. His degree is likely in the field of engineering, and he is acknowledged as a truly brilliant scientist, if only he'd stop making evil androids and cyborgs.
    -   _GT_'s Dr. Myuu. Definitely evil, created the parasitic Baby. Later, teamed up with Gero to concoct an evil plan that allowed _Hell to invade Earth_.
    -   On the good side, we've got Bulma's father Dr. Briefs, who is mildly eccentric (he delays an interstellar manned space journey for weeks to install a cappuccino machine in the craft) but generally helpful.
    -   Dr. Hedo, Gero's grandson, is introduced as having been in trouble with the law and shares his grandfather's passion for creating cyborgs (though he refers to himself as a biologist and medical doctor first and foremost). Ironically enough, he turns out to be good, even heroic, if a little misguided and naive... which allows the villains to trick him into making superweapons for them, believing he's fighting on the side of justice.
-   The manga _EDD or Eliminate Dangerous Doctors_ is this. It involves an organization whose sole purpose is to rid Morally Ambiguous Doctorates through questionable and illegal means, including murder, invasion of privacy, and espionage.
-   The titular _Franken Fran_. She isn't so much morally ambiguous as much as she is determined to keep her patients alive through ANY means. Borderlines on this when she's feeling spiteful of someone who wronged her. She even takes requests.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_ has quite a few doctors since alchemy is a field of study as well as a practical military strength. Most of these doctors were working for the shadow government to create Philosopher's Stones using prisoners of war... but special mention goes to Gold-Toothed Doctor, the man responsible for the creation of Wrath, the implanting process for which took the lives of around 11 test subjects.
    -   Shou Tucker, who made his own wife into a talking chimera to get his State Alchemist license, and made his daughter into one to keep it. In the manga omakes, he is the only character to end up going to Hell. Which is saying something — at least one of the ones who went to heaven was a psychopath who loved blowing up people for kicks and giggles.
-   Dr. Jackal aka Kuroudou Akabane, from _Get Backers_ is quite amoral... though not really "evil" (he only kills those who get in his way, and has never been known to harm women or children). Likes to slice people up with his special scalpels and giggles in a rather _unique_ way while doing so. His backstory shows that he was a dedicated surgeon in the past, but then his best friend's son died despite all his efforts to save him...
-   The Doktor (sic) from _Hellsing_: Evil. Part of a (Neo-)Nazi organisation, makes vampires and all that fun stuff. To complete the evil combo he also has a sixth finger. (You only notice it if you put attention in his hands as this is never mentioned in the manga.)
-   Dr. Jail Scaglietti of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_. Big Bad inter-dimensional criminal Mad Scientist who specializes in biological research and manipulation. Definitely evil.
-   _Mazinger Z_: Dr. Hell is a Mad Scientist and the Big Bad. He also was a Large Ham. To be fair, knowledge or science did not make him evil; Abusive Parents and shitty early life experiences convinced him Humans Are Bastards. He devoted himself to learn science because it helped him to keep himself sane. However, after his sanity finally slipped out due to too much abuse, he decided to use his scientific knowledge to make everyone pay.
-   In _Minamoto-kun Monogatari_, Minamoto Kaoruko fancies herself a sociologist, so much that she strives to re-enact the story of Hikaru Genji with her gynophobic nephew, Terumi, and a _selected_ group of her students in university, each one of them with psychological traits similar to those of Genji's conquests and of course, this is not played for salvation or comedy. Needless to say, this screams **unethical** everywhere, if only for the enormous risk this poses to the fragile psyche of her subjects.
-   Most of the adult characters from _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ have doctorates in something. Examples such as Kozo Fuyutsuki (Gendo Ikari's Yes-Man (but with his own reasons)), Yui Ikari (The Chessmaster, according to some readings), Ritsuko Akagi ('cause committing mass 2nd-degree murder the dummy system is a sane act) and Naoko Akagi (just pure crazy, up to and including murdering Rei I for calling her a "hag"). And all of them are pricks in one way or another.
-   _One Piece_: Doctor Vegapunk. Not introduced yet, but his reputations far precede him; presumably evil, and certainly eccentric. Invented a process that lets inanimate objects swallow fruit. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Trafalgar Law: Subversion. His reputation seemed to be painting him as this, but it turns out he is actually a decent guy, although cold and cruel at times. He was also trained from early childhood by his parents, who were both renowned physicians and surgeons.
    -   Dr. Hogback: Evilutionary Biologist.
-   Scythe Master from _Phantom of Inferno_ is eventually revealed to have a doctorate in psychology. It explains how he was able to erase Ellen and Reiji's memories, and brainwash the Zahlenschwestern into being, though it's subverted because he doesn't use the title of "Doctor".
-   _Rebuild World_: Doctor Yatsubiyashi is introduced at a medical clinic treating Akira's injuries while trying to sell him medicine with a Sickly Green Glow. He later sets up a Mad Scientist Laboratory looking clinic in the slums of Kugamayama, where he offers the poor residents two choices: pay, or be subject to Playing with Syringes in exchange, in order to circumvent having to go through official trials. Even later, Yatsubiyashi sets up a field clinic in a warzone where he gives seriously injured hunters three options: Pay way more than what the treatment should cost, do favors for him, or hobble through the war-zone to the nearest base. And then there's striking a Deal with the Devil to make and plant Evil Knockoff hunters to act as Agent Provocateur during the assault on Tsubaki's sanctum, in exchange for data on Lost Technology.
-   _Sailor Moon_: Souichi Tomoe; evil, possessed, had a Tyke-Bomb that ended up on the good side. Does a Heel–Face Turn in the first anime at the end of his arc. Interestingly, the title "Doctor" has only been used in a dub, possibly to cement this trope. His official title is _Professor_ Tomoe, both in reference to running a school but also presumably losing his original title after being shunned by the medical community for shady experimentation.
-   Dr. Nii Jianyi from _Saiyuki_: so very, _very_ evil. The lead scientist working for Gyokuman Koushou, He's actively trying to resurrect Gyumao, an action that will likely bring about the end-of-days, because he's _bored_. Plus, as it turns out, he's actually a Sanzo, with the power to _negate existence_. He's also responsible for some of the major evils in the series, such as Brainwashed Kougaiji and Kami-Sama to name a few, particularly creepy, examples.
-   The Doctor, aka William Conrad, from _Trigun_. Evil, although reluctantly so.
-   Dr. Faker from _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_. Actually, he may have a legitimate doctorate, but he's still a Mad Scientist. Or so we think. As it turns out, he's not very mad at all, and is more like a Well-Intentioned Extremist.
-   The Doktor from _Yu Gi Oh ARCV_. His work involves implanting parasites into people's brains and brainwashing them. While he works for the Professor towards a somewhat noble goal, the Doktor himself takes a lot of pleasure in his work. He expresses zero concern for his puppets, and talks to Yuya, simply to brag about how he can't rescue the captives.
-   "Doctor" from _YuYu Hakusho_ (Chapter Black saga): Evil, does a Heel–Face Turn. Is also an actual _medical_ doctor. And Dr. Ichigaki, an evil, scheming Mad Scientist.
    -   The Doctor is freaking insane when Yusuke fights him. He kills at least 10 people, slices open one of the good guys' spines, slashes another one's stomach, and is generally evil. He also controls his body chemistry so that he can stay conscious the entire time while he's unleashing killer bugs. And releases endorphins so he feels good as his arm is getting shot off. He eventually is knocked out/dies briefly but is brought back by Genkai.
        -   Because although he was _extremely_ evil, Yusuke at this point in his moral development can't handle killing a human, although killing demons has never provoked his conscience in the least. (Later on, after his genes activate and he's a demon, he offers to go find his ancestor Raizen some people to eat because he doesn't want the old guy to die, so apparently he gets over this.)
        -   Doctor never actually does a formal Heel–Face Turn, he just gets off Sensui's psycho train and disappears into the world with a new face courtesy of his plastic surgery skills, chuckling. Later, it is mentioned in the voiceover narration that he opened a dojo dedicated to psychic surgery.

    Comic Books 

_The DCU_:

-   The Doctor, from _The Authority_: Good, if often stoned and quite weird. Though able and willing to do some really nasty stuff in the name of good. Taking a country and freezing it briefly in time so it and all its inhabitants end up frozen and exploded in space, anyone?
-   _Batman_:
    -   Subverted with Hugo Strange, who despite holding a doctorate in psychiatry, is never called Doctor Strange (possibly due to the below), rather, he's always called _Professor_. Either way, he's evil.
    -   Before becoming The Scarecrow, Jonathan Crane held a doctorate in psychology and still sometimes refers to himself as "Doctor Crane", as despite being an insane supervillain, he views himself as a mere scientist dedicated to the study of fear.
    -   Nominally inverted by Victor Fries — while he _does_ have a doctorate, his supervillain name drops the "Dr." in favor of "Mr. Freeze."
    -   The Bat also finds himself fighting a number of other inversions who hold doctorates but don't include their title in their supervillain names including Dr. Isley (Poison Ivy), Dr. Quinzell (Harley Quinn), the aforementioned Dr. Crane (The Scarecrow), and Dr. Elliot (Hush).
    -   King Tut AKA The Pharaoh is also a professor and most likely has a Ph.D., but Doctor isn't part of his villainous name, either.
    -   The Crime Doctor: Evil... depending on the continuity. Pre-Crisis he was moderately evil; a gang boss who still held by his Inconvenient Hippocratic Oath. In _Batman: The Animated Series_ he was good, but pressurized into becoming a mob doctor by his evil brother. Post-Crisis, he's a bona fide Mad Doctor, a serial killer who wears Elton John sunglasses (taken as a trophy from his first victim, a female med student).
-   Doctor Fate from the DCU has a complicated history. He's Good in a cosmic sense, but this may or may not translate to giving much of a damn about humanity (especially in the versions where Doctor Fate is actually being _possessed_ by a Lord of Order as opposed to simply being a person in a costume), and in most incarnations doesn't actually hold an earned doctorate anyway.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Doctor Light: Two of them in The DCU, the male one (who also uses his surname as his moniker — Arthur Light) is evil, the female one is good (but very abrasive). It helps that the female Dr. Light happens to be a practicing medical doctor as well as an all-around scientist.
-   Dr. Niles Caulder, AKA, the Chief. Technically a hero, but caused the disasters that made the Doom Patrol metahumans and made them superheroes just to study them. He also tries to keep them in line through emotional manipulation and the most likely empty promise of making them normal again.
-   _The Flash_: Doctor Alchemy: at least 50% evil. His good side is a real doctor if not a medical one, but the evil half is more of mad sorcerer.
-   Dr. Mid-Nite of the JSA is a (super)heroic physician. An aversion, since he's definitely Good, not even a jerk, and actually did use to be a licensed and accredited medical professional. When they first meet, Black Canary is surprised to realize Mid-Nite really is a doctor. "Let's just say I've met a few Doctor Fill-in-the-blank types who didn't come close to the Hippocratic Oath."
-   Doc Magnus, creator of the Metal Men. Good, although he spent an Audience-Alienating Era brainwashed into a would-be world conqueror and is definitely a Mad Scientist as a group of less scrupulous doctors learned when they tried shanghaiing him to work for them in _52_.
-   _Robin_: The villain Doctor Ruthless. She doesn't go for the medical doctor slant as she is covered in armor, but no attempt is made to address whether she actually has a doctorate.
-   _Shazam!_: Doctor Sivana: Evil _and loving it_, and stark raving insane.
-   In _Superman_, Dr. Emil Hamilton started as a minor antagonist who quickly became Superman's go-to guy for technical know-how. He eventually became a villain.
-   Several characters in the WildStorm universe (where Authority takes place) have held the title of "The Doctor," but only the so-called "renegade" Doctor was explicitly said to be an actual doctor, being a heart surgeon. And, ironically, evil. The one given above was a (former) multi-media/dotcom billionaire and his successor was a Palestinian suicide bomber before getting his powers (also good).
-   _Wonder Woman_ villains Doctor Poison, Doctor Cyber, and (with what is probably the best super-villain name ever) Doctor Psycho: Evil. According to the _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_ tie-in comic, Doctor Cyber has multiple PhDs in _literature_.

_Marvel Universe_:

-   A Captain America story in _All-Winners Comics_ had a one-off Mad Scientist named Dr. Botan, who kidnapped people and merged them with plants.
-   Doctor Doom: Evil? Yeah. You have to be pretty evil for your father to make his servant promise to always protect _the world_ from _you_, _when you're a little boy_. He's also not a real doctor; he's got a degree from the University of Latveria, but it's a self-granted one that he "received" after he took over the country. To his credit, he _was_ a legitimately brilliant student at New York State University prior to being expelled for causing the explosion that disfigured him and has done enough original work that he could easily get a real doctorate if he really wanted to and wasn't a notorious criminal dictator. Oddly enough, he goes by doctor, while the legitimately multi-doctorate-degreed Reed Richards goes by mister in his super-id. This is probably an attempt at soothing his ego, as he has always been ruefully jealous of Reed's success in university.
    -   And then there's Doom's lesser-known cousin, Doctor Bob Doom, DDS, a one-shot She-Hulk villain.
-   _Doctor Strange_: Doctor Stephen Strange: Formerly a brilliant but callous and egotistical young surgeon. Currently good, but eccentric, possessing a lot of arcane knowledge he really doesn't have time to explain to you, so just stand back and let him save the day already.
-   A rather humorous example: Howard the Duck's foe Dr. Bong is a Mad Scientist and not a real doctor, but years after his conflict with Howard, he tries to earn a legitimate PhD in psychology. Unfortunately, his first patient during his internship is Deadpool, and suffice to say, that kind of messed things up...
-   Doctors Tony Stark from _Iron Man_, Reed Richards from _Fantastic Four_, and Bruce Banner from _The Incredible Hulk_. Good, but often with major Jerkass tendencies.
-   _Nova (2007):_ Doctor Evlyn Necker, an attractive but slightly shady scientist who turns out to be working as a mole for A.I.M., even if she's actually quite nice on-page (though naming her robot project "Minion" is pretty sus as it). When she returned a few years later in _Revolutionary War_, she'd scratched out the "morally ambiguous" bit and gone full Mad Scientist. Of course, given she's a younger, alternate version of the mad scientist who created Death's Head II for HYDRA, the madness was probably a given.
-   _Spider-Man_: Doctor Octopus, cephalopod-themed supervillain and Mad Scientist. Unlike most examples, he does hold an actual doctorate, although it isn't in medicine.
-   Dr. Jonas Harrow, occasional Spider-Man villain who is responsible for the Kangaroo and Hammerhead becoming villains; evil Mad Scientist, and not a very good one. He once did have a license to practice medicine, but he lost it for practicing illegal experiments.
-   Dr Oonagh Mullarkey is Mys-Tech’s most prominent scientist and responsible for creating or enhancing many of their superhumans and monstrous minions. She eventually gets tired of working behind the scenes, attempts to give herself superpowers and makes herself an even worse human being by exporting her conscience and the ‘good’ parts of her personality into _Plasmer_.
-   _Thunderbolts_: Dr. Karla Sofen, aka Moonstone, is one hell of a Psycho Psychologist (or Psychiatrist; either way, her knowledge of the human mind makes Karla a dangerous Manipulative Bitch).

Other Publishers:

-   _Atomic Robo_: Dr. Dinosaur, Robo's Arch-Enemy and batshit insane time-traveling(?) dinosaur scientist. He has a doctorate… from the University of Akkad in ancient Mesopotamia. He keeps his (four-thousand years old and baked in clay) degree hung up in his EVIL office. Robo is fairly certain it is not real but also has given up on arguing with Dr. D about it. Either way, he refuses to call him "professor".
-   _Blake and Mortimer_ live and breathe this trope. In rough order of publication;
    -   Dr. Sun Fo in _The Secret Of The Swordfish_. His field of expertise is never specified, and he spends most of the story as a Mouth of Sauron for the Big Bad, Emperor Basam Damdu. Definitely morally ambiguous, though: even State Sec boss Colonel Olrik and his men think he's a snake in the grass.
    -   Dr. Jonathan Septimus from _The Yellow "M"_ is the most infamous example. A medical doctor specializing in the human brain, he's developed technology allowing him to completely (or so he thinks) control another human's behavior. While he mostly uses it to remote-control his slave into committing crimes around London, he also sees him as "the perfect prototype of the citizen-robot of the future."
    -   Dr. Miloch Georgevitch is a Soviet scientist who's developed sophisticated weather-control technology, uses it to wreak havoc on Western Europe, and is planning to use it to enable a Soviet conquest of the continent. _That's just his day job_. On his own time, he's also tinkered with time travel technology, and before dying, he wills his time machine to Mortimer... after sabotaging it to ensure that it'll trap Mortimer in A Fate Worse Than Death, cycling through time without ever being able to return to his own era.
    -   Dr. Voronov: a KGB scientist who uses biological warfare to target world leaders on both sides of the Iron Curtain, in the hopes of restoring Stalinism to the USSR and despite the risk of starting a world war. Doesn't hesitate to use children as part of his schemes.
    -   Dr Z'ong, the main antagonist from _The Strange Encounter,_ is a downplayed version. A Well-Intentioned Extremist with a sympathetic motive, he's a time traveler from After the End, when the nuclear wars of the 21st century have doomed humanity to a slow death, and wants to help his people escape their fate. Unfortunately, he plans to do this by colonizing the 20th century and allying himself with deposed dictator Basam Damdu, reasoning that since he's actually managed to Take Over the World once, he's the one best qualified to help them rule it. Because his own era is so far from the twentieth century, Z'ong doesn't realize that his new ally is A Nazi by Any Other Name whose rule would be catastrophic for everyone, ultimately including the time travelers. (This becomes even more ironic considering that Basam Damdu had a massive nuclear arsenal of his own, and came within seconds of nuking the entire planet in a fit of rage while watching his regime collapse around him).
    -   The same book, however, finally gives us an aversion with Dr. Kaufman, the American scientist whose request for help brings Mortimer into the story in the first place. He's unambiguously one of the good guys, even accompanying Blake, Mortimer, and their FBI allies on the time-travelers' portal.
-   Lampshaded in _Pafman_, when a centaur villain presents himself as "Professor Sagittarius" and the main character complains "(All villains) are either professors or doctors".
-   _Tintin_:
    -   Dr. J.W. Müller, who first appeared in "The Black Island" as a Psycho Psychologist and member of a gang of forgers who tries to have Tintin admitted to his private sanitorium... after undergoing some "special treatment", of course. He later returns in "Land of Black Gold" as Professor Smith, and in "The Red Sea Sharks" as Mull Pasha.
    -   Dr. Krollspell from "Flight 714", a specialist in Truth Serums (with a loose resemblance to Dr. Mengele) who later switches sides after finding out that his employer, the Big Bad Roberto Rastapopoulos, intends to kill him.
-   _Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_'s Pharma, a rare example of a character who manages to be this _despite_ being an actual practicing well-respected medical doctor (at first, at least; he loses the job after attacking the facility he works at with a virus that liquefies the victim's internal organs).

    Comic Strips 

-   _Ink Pen_: Mad Scientist "Mr. Negato" admits that he was denied his degree.

    Fan Works 

-   The Discworld-set fics of A.A. Pessimal expand on the canonical concept that the Guild of Assassins also trains for, and confers, advanced degrees including a PhD, the Doctor of Assassination title. Education for Assassin schoolpupils does not end at the age of eighteen. Optionally, or by invitation, an exceptionally talented pupil may return to follow a University level track, studying for undergraduate degrees (B.Ass), the Masters degree (M.Ass) or even for a fully-fledged PhD. It therefore follows on that there are a lot of Doctors on the teaching staff, something bright pupils are wary of. Even if the doctorates were conferred by other institutions for other reasons, such as Doctor Smith-Rhodes having her PhD in Zoology, or - after much trying over two decades - Doctor Alice Band getting hers for Archaeology and History.
-   _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_ has Dr. Brainstorm, although he's usually a Harmless Villain and finds himself in an Enemy Mine situation twice.
-   _Crucible_ has Dr. Swan, a man who wanted to make his career by imprisoning an apparently amnesiac man to perform illegal treatments on him (which included direct electro brain stimulation). When the patient escaped with one of his nurses and years later, when the woman came back to look for jobs after her husband's death, he took revenge by forcing her into prostitution and later drowning her in drug abuses until she died from an overdose and her daughter was adopted. Karma came to bite him in the ass when her dead husband, who turned out to be the previously sealed Grim Reaper gave him a punishment.
-   Professor Kabuto from _Pony POV Series_ certainly counts. The Changelings' psychotic Alchemist Master and resident Mad Doctor, Kabuto views all other creatures as potential test subjects for his horrific experiments, which in the past has resulted in countless deaths of both other creatures and his own kind. He repeatedly attempts to get permission to or attempt to vivisect the mane cast and the other heroes he comes in conflict with. He also plays this trope literally, as he has a doctorate of some sort.
-   Averted with Dr. Sawbones from _The Rise of Darth Vulcan_. Yeah, he works for Vulcan and the Diamond Dogs, but only because he is a very dedicated doctor, with the compulsion to treat any injured creature that appears before him, no matter their allegiance, and is clearly disgusted by other quack medical theories, like the ones that encourage thestrals (batponies) to be malnourished, by preventing them getting the meat and blood they need to _survive_.
-   _Child of the Storm_ has Doctor Strange, as per canon — except that this version is a Chessmaster who manipulates the heck out of everyone in order to make the best possible future come about. While he's unambiguously on the side of good, he's also most definitely not sweetness and light, and he isn't afraid to get his hands dirty if necessary (remember, his main job is beating up/scamming Eldritch Abominations).
    -   The sequel gives us Doctor Nathan Essex, aka Sinister. He's a bad guy who regards the world as his petri dish, and Strange describes him as the master who taught freakin' _Arnim Zola_ everything he knows.
    -   Speaking of which, Zola himself qualifies, being an Omnidisciplinary Scientist who is willing to sink to any depths for the sake of science and/or advancing HYDRA's goals.
-   In _For the Glory of Irk_, Professor Membrane's new wife Moira, a fellow scientist, openly admits to being morally ambiguous. When Dib complains about this to his father, the Professor just happily says it's something they have in common.
-   Tarkin's Fist: Dr. Curu, an Imperial scientist in charge of Project Stork; an Imperial breeding program designed to increase the New Empire's population. The purpose of the project is to conduct medical experiments on pregnant women taken from Earth. These experiments seek to genetically modify the still developing babies in their mothers wombs to remove the Earth born human's dependency on potassium. Potassium turns out to be a rare substance in Imperial born humans and all other alien species. Furthermore, it turns out that Midichlorians, in addition to being a conduit between the Force and an individual, also serve as a substitute for potassium in aliens and Imperial humans. So removing potassium from a still developing fetus while engaging in other aspects of genetic manipulation results in the subsequent child developing a higher midichlorian count to compensate. These newly modified children, now genetically similar to baseline Imperial humans, are separated from their Earth born mothers and raised as Imperials. Curu himself sees his work as improving these unborn children; in his view a life in the Empire affords greater opportunities and rewards than life on primitive, war torn Earth.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Lilo & Stitch_: Dr. Jumba Jookiba: Self-proclaimed "Evil Genius." Not all that threatening, though.

-   Dr. Claude Belgon of _The Mysterious Geographic Explorations of Jasper Morello_, a “controversial biologist” who feeds people to a man-eating monster in the name of curing the plague ravaging his homeland.
-   Keith David as Dr. Facilier from _The Princess and the Frog_. He's a _witch_ doctor. And an evil one, since you ask.
-   In _Toy Story_, Buzz and Woody witness the sadistic Sid play doctor, sewing a plastic pterodactyl head onto his sister's doll's neck.
-   Played with in _Toy Story 3_:
    
    **Buzz:** Evil Doctor Porkchop!  
    **Hamm:** That's Mister Evil Doctor Porkchop to you!
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Dr. T, from the movie _The 5,000 Fingers Of Dr. T_, is an evil... piano teacher. The trope is subverted, however, by the writer of the film, who is most definitely good... Dr. Seuss.
-   _The Abominable Dr. Phibes_: Well, the clarifier gives it away, doesn't it? Evil, in a woobielicious sort of way, and terrifyingly inventive.
-   The main villain of the film _Amen_ is credited only as The Doctor, and is a member of the SS supervising the extermination camps.

-   _The Assignment (2016)_: Dr. Rachel Jane was a surgeon whose unethical and illegal experiments meant she lost her license. This didn't stop her though-she just went underground with them. However, this is contrasted with normal psychiatrist Dr. Ralph Gales who's assessing her and considers what she did completely wrong and notes she betrayed her oath as a physician.
-   _Austin Powers_: Doctor Evil: He didn't spend six years at frickin' Evil Medical School to be called "Mister", thank you very much.
-   Perhaps Doc Brown from _Back to the Future_ escapes this trope because he's not known as "Dr. Brown". Or perhaps because he is not evil. He does steal a train but it's only to save Marty not an evil scheme or for science. He jokes it is a science experiment, but it wasn't.
-   From _Batman & Robin_, we have Dr. Jason Woodrue, who creates Bane and tries to kill Dr. Pamela Isley when she rejects his offer to rule the world together. Interestingly, like in the Comic Books Folder above, Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze _don't_ use their doctoral titles.
-   Dr. Varnick in the first _Beethoven_ movie, a veterinarian who secretly does illegal experiments with animals.
-   _The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_: Dr. Caligari: Evil, but only within the hero's mind.
-   Very common in David Cronenberg's films, although there's rarely a pure-good or pure-evil doctor. In order of release:
    -   _Shivers (1975)_: Dr. Emil Hobbes is crazy. Dr. Roger St. Luc is okay until he turns into a rape zombie. Yes, you read that right. _Shivers_ is a screwed-up movie.
    -   _Rabid_: Dr. Dan Keloid is okay until he turns into a zombie.
    -   _The Brood_: Dr. Hal Raglan is also a bit unethical, and a bit of a fuck-up, but not really evil.
    -   _Scanners_: Dr. Paul Ruth is _very_ unethical, but not really an antagonist.
    -   _The Fly (1986)_: Dr. Seth Brundle is really sweet. Brundlefly, however, is not.
    -   _Dead Ringers_: Doctors Elliot and Beverly Mantle are... really fucking creepy.
-   Vincent Price's character in _Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine_ is a mad scientist who builds female robots as part of a Honey Pot scheme.
-   Dr. Mabuse, from a number of German films beginning with _Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler_ in 1922. Not only is he one of the original criminal masterminds, but he also uses "telepathic hypnosis" to force others to do his will. What's his ultimate goal? To spread as much fear and terror as possible and destroy the world, _then_ rule it. Yikes. Luckily, his own self-destructive tendencies ("M'abuse" is French for "I abuse myself") make him his own worst enemy.

-   _The Evil That Men Do_ (1984): Dr Clement Molloch advises South American dictatorships on how to torture people. He is definitely evil.
-   _Forbidden Planet_: Doctor Morbius is unconsciously evil, because With Great Power Comes Great Insanity. Awake, he's just a grouch.
-   Peter Venkman in _Ghostbusters_, who has degrees in parapsychology and psychology, usually only falls into the Dr. Jerk territory. However, at the beginning of the first film, he was worse, lying during a test on volunteers, simply because he didn't want to inflict the painful punishment on the attractive female one (much to the dismay of the other one).
-   _House of 1000 Corpses_ has Dr. Satan. Evil through and through, but he is arguably the best-named doctor of all time.
-   _The Human Centipede_: Dr. Heiter: A man with a vision. A vision that humanity cannot accept by any means, for good reason.
-   _James Bond_:
    -   _Dr. No_'s titular character, a nuclear physicist who moonlights as a criminal mastermind and operative of SPECTRE.
    -   Dr. Kananga in _Live and Let Die_, who happens to both a dictator and drug kingpin.
    -   _Tomorrow Never Dies_: Dr. Kaufman. Affably Evil but sadistic and cruel underneath. A professor of forensic science, who can zhoot you from Stuttgart und still create ze illusion of suicide. He is also an expert in torture, but he calls _that_ a "just a hobby".
-   A very subtle example in _Joe Versus the Volcano_. In the beginning, the protagonist is told by an apparently well-meaning doctor named Dr. Ellison that he has six months to live, due to an incurable condition called a "brain cloud". This is what inspires Joe to accept Graynamore's offer to volunteer as a Human Sacrifice for the natives he wants to make a deal with. It isn't until the final scene of the movie that Patricia tells him that Ellison is actually Graynamore's personal physician, meaning he's was likely lying to set Joe up, making Ellison an immoral violator of the Hippocratic Oath.
-   Doctor Miller is the evillest character in _The Legend of Frenchie King_, being responsible for the only death in the whole movie (besides his own) and suffering from Lack of Empathy. However, he's a non-threat for most of it due to being incapacitated.
-   The B-Movie spoof _The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra_ has both a good and evil scientist, both of whom are doctors.
-   _Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation_ has The Bone Doctor, a rogue agent thought dead, who specializes in osteo-torture.
-   Dr. Barton in _Next of Kin (1982)_ acts in a suspiciously aloof fashion and is evasive of the details of the heroine's past, including information on her unstable aunt Rita who may possibly be the malevolent presence alluded to in her mother's diary.
-   Dr. Herschel in _Patrick Still Lives_ keeps a group of comatose patients alive in his laboratory for the purpose of scientific research.
-   _Planet of the Apes (1968)_: Dr. Zaius: ethically questionable... OK, very unethical. In fact, an antagonist. He routinely performs lethal experiments on those inferior humans, although he later explains _why_ he's so wary of man.
-   _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ Dr. Frank. N. Furter: Okay, so we don't know if he's REALLY a doctor, but he's sure deep into the Mad Science. While initially he seems more hedonistic than evil, he turns out to be willing to deceive, manipulate and even rape people, cuts out half a man's brain for an experiment, later brutally murders that same man (yes, he survived having half his brain removed) just for upstaging him briefly, and _eats_ him as well as serving the meat to an unwitting Brad and Janet. He's a Bad Boss who whips his servant (really more like a slave) for disobeying him, and is also a prince from an alien planet who came to earth to conquer it before getting distracted by having sex with humans.
-   Dr. Blight from the Hulk Hogan vehicle _Santa with Muscles_. Likes to spray Lysol cans in a dramatic manner.
-   _Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_. Dr. Totenkopf and his team of Reluctant Mad Scientists from Unit 11.
    -   Although it is found that he does have a bit of a justification behind his dickery, even if it involves some atrocities along the way.
-   _Splice_ has two scientists that are similar to those in _Species_, namely becoming gradually more obsessed with their creation to the point of throwing ethical considerations out of the window and having sex with it.
-   Doctor Tolian Soran in _Star Trek: Generations_ was definitely NOT good. In fact, he killed Captain Kirk.
-   _Thank You for Smoking_ has the German scientist doing medical research for the tobacco companies.
    
    **Nick:** He's been researching tobacco for thirty years and hasn't found any conclusive evidence linking cigarettes and cancer. This guy's a _genius_. The man could disprove _gravity_.
    
-   _Transformers_: The Doctor. "Ve must hav ze brain on ze table! Chop-chop!" Even his little assistant-bots are designed so that he takes the data they've collected by impaling them to death (a rather inefficient use of resources, you'd think.) When asked what his doctorate is in, he has a tendency to reply with something like 'everything'.

    Literature 

-   _Ben Safford Mysteries:_ In _The Attending Physician_, eight doctors in Ben's hometown (one of them a Posthumous Character) have spent years billing for nonexistent operations, making patients get unnecessary operations and examinations, and diagnosing unnecessary drug prescriptions. Between them, they've cheated the government out of over a million dollars without a hint of remorse.
    
    _Lieutenant Doyle:_ Every single one of them is convinced he's got a God-given right to anything he wants and nobody should even ask questions.
    
-   From the Discworld are Dr. Cruces, head of the Assassins' Guild and user of the gonne in _Men at Arms_; Dr. Whiteface and the intimidating and humourless leader of the Fools' Guild. "Doctor" is a non-doctorate academic title.
    -   It is pointed out that the Guild of Assassins is not _just_ an educational institution offering the usual school-level stuff to pupils aged eleven-to-eighteen. It also trains for, and confers, advanced degrees including a PhD, the Doctor of Assassination title. What a degree in Assassination entails, let alone the postgraduate track, is left undescribed. Assassins who can legitimately call themselves "Doctor" are therefore to be more than usually feared.
-   The titular island-owner of _Dr. Franklin's Island_ is as amoral as they come — hybridizing animals with human genes, refusing to euthanize the ones that survive the process even if they do so in "very twisted forms", incorporating teenaged human castaways into the project and having them turned into monsters, and playing psychological games all the while. His assistant Doctor Skinner is... willing to go along with most of it (though he's shaken when he speaks to a rayfish that was once a girl) but can't stand the psychological torment, and alternates ineffectual attempts to help the teens escape with working for his boss as usual.
-   The Doctor (name not revealed), the illegally-practicing therapist from John Barth's novel _The End of the Road_: highly intelligent, sometimes very perceptive, but amoral, egotistical, and doesn't seem to be doing any good for his patients. Accidentally kills one of the main characters by performing an abortion, which he botches.
-   _Error of Judgement_: Dr. Prince is a callous careerist who cares far more for receiving acclaim as a surgeon than actually properly treating his patients and has unnecessarily removed dozens of healthy uteruses without the slightest remorse, just to get more praise for supposedly saving their lives by doing so.
-   In the afterword of her novel _Evil Genius_, Catherine Jinks says that she got the idea from watching her son playing with figurines of "Action Man" and "Dr. X", which got her wondering where and how supervillains get their degrees.
-   Doctor Frankenstein: Byronic Hero, obsessive to the point of foolhardy.
    -   Victor Frankenstein is a college dropout in the original book. The title is only given to him in later adaptations (as is the title Baron — his family do not hold a barony, and if they did then the title would belong to his father).
    -   In the sequels by Dean Koontz, Victor is indeed a doctor. Also, evil. Also, insane.
-   Dr. Fu Manchu from the novels by Sax Rohmer, "with all the cruel cunning of an entire Eastern race, accumulated in one giant intellect, with all the resources of science past and present, with all the resources, if you will, of a wealthy government... the Yellow Peril incarnate in one man."
-   Kind of an overarching trope in Genteel Interbellum Setting mysteries, especially those by Agatha Christie herself, wherein doctors are very frequently murderers. Several books reference the Crippen case and other murderous doctors who were in the public consciousness at the time. Additionally, doctors had access to large amounts of barbiturates, giving them the perceived ability to murder by drug overdose and get away with it.
-   _Green-Sky Trilogy_: Dr. (D'ol) Wissen was definitely stated to have his hand in some...unpleasant matters, and implied to have his hand in many more including ordering the murder of his research partner Dr. Neshom.
-   _A Harvest of War_: Guinevere Thyll has great medical skill but first and foremost she is a greedy, murderous warrior.
-   _Heart of Steel_ gives us Dr. Alistair Mechanus. All we (eventually) know about his education was that he graduated from MIT with a double major in biology and robotics and had a (rather tragic) psychotic break soon afterwards. Apparently the "Doctor" title is self-awarded.
-   Doctor T in _Imminent Danger and How To Fly Straight into It_ is an alien version of this. He purchases the heroine and her best friend to use as test subjects. On his first day with them, he removes the heroine's brain. Things only get worse from there.
-   _Incompetence_ gives us Dr. Rutter, a coroner who removes the faces of cadavers and stitches them onto the buttocks of other cadavers. _As a hobby_.

-   _John Putnam Thatcher:_
    -   The intrigue of _A Stitch in Time_ involves a hospital overflowing with corruption and ethics breaches.
        -   Dr. Wendell Martin, the murder victim, causes a patient's death through extreme negligence during an operation and (aided by his colleagues Wittke, Neverson, and Bullivant) tries to cover it up.
        -   Martin has been lying to patients about their health so they'll pay him for unnecessary gall bladder removals. When another doctor confronts him about this, Martin fires him.
        -   Martin, Wittke, Wittke's two sons (who are also doctors), and Neverson write their patients expensive (and sometimes unnecessary) prescriptions for drugs from a company that they secretly own while cheaply importing those drugs from abroad.
        -   Martin has been accepting cash payments for operations and not reporting them to the IRS.
        -   Dr. Bullivant, the head of the obstetrics department, had been performing abortions for money and writing them up as miscarriages, pre-Roe v. Wade.
        -   Neverson kills Martin to keep him from implicating the others.
    -   The villain in _Green Grow the Dollars_ has a PhD in botany and resorts to murder after a failed attempt to steal a colleague's work.
-   _The Lord of the Rings_: Saruman fits the trope. His "profession" seems to fit the scientist trope in many respects. He does "research" on the rings, and makes a classical Faustian slide into the realm of Evil.
-   In _The Mouse Watch_, Dr. Thornpaw is a Cyborg Mad Scientist who wants to Take Over the World. Since he's also a rat — literally — it's unclear who gave him his title.
-   In the _My Name Is Legion_ story "Home Is the Hangman", Dr. Leila isn't evil, per se, but she uses her patients for her own ends to run an extra-legal errand, resulting in her death.
-   _Riley McDaniels_: Doctor Wallace is rumored to be involved in moonshining and protection rackets. It eventually turns out that his medical practice consists of prescribing liquor for supposed medical reasons as a loophole to avoid laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol and giving an elderly patient Worst Aid to steal her money.
-   _The Scarlet Letter_ has Roger Chillingworth, the inquisitive and respected physician, uses his knowledge of medicine and people to manipulate Reverend Dimmesdale on several occasions to satisfy his own personal paranoia and nosy desires. Made more disturbing when he's shown to be getting an obvious _pleasure_ from watching his patient and implied personal friend squirm at his instigation.
-   Doctor Orwell from _A Series of Unfortunate Events_.
-   Dr. Grimesby Roylott, from the Sherlock Holmes story "The Adventure of the Speckled Band." Attempts to use a snake to kill his twin stepdaughters for their inheritance money, succeeding the first time; however, with a little help from Holmes, the snake turns on him before he can succeed again.
-   _The Silence of the Lambs_: Dr. Hannibal Lecter eats people, but call him evil and he'll explain just how small-minded the idea of 'good and evil' is and by the end of it you'll agree with him.
-   Dr. Nye, from _Skulduggery Pleasant_. A sadistic war criminal who was known for his experiments on prisoners of war. also helps that he's a creepy insect-like humanoid with long, spindly limbs, and visual evidence of once having his mouth sewn shut.
-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire_, the in-universe equivalent of the title "Doctor" is "Maester", and maesters are usually medical doctors. They are normally pacifists and do no harm. However, one disgraced maester, named Qyburn, was banished from the Citadel (i.e. got his license revoked) for experimenting on live humans and dabbling in necromancy. He served as a field medic in a company of psychos for hire and later multiclassed as a spymaster for a bitch-queen.
-   _Soon I Will Be Invincible_: Doctor Impossible, thanks to his Malign Hypercognition Disorder. He's an Anti-Villain, but he did get up to doomsday machine mark V.
-   Dr. Nikola, from the novels by Guy Bootby: Evil, but with a very likable disposition.
-   In _The Speed of Dark_, the doctors who invented the autism cure are extremely shady. They plagiarize and mislabel medical images and push Lou and his coworkers to go through the treatment all at once, even though one at a time would be safer. Because treating adult autistics isn't very profitable, Lou strongly suspects they have ulterior motives. They do — they want to market an attention-control treatment to employers. They test it on Lou's coworker Bailey, who ends up severely brain-damaged.
-   Dr. Evazan, who appeared in many _Star Wars_ Expanded Universe sources, such as _Galaxy of Fear_. Evil criminal Mad Scientist, and Immortality Seeker. Suffice to say that his criminal activities had _a lot_ to do with why his face was so scarred. Bonus points for having the In-Series Nickname "Doctor Death". He actually first appeared in _A New Hope_, but it was a minor role, as the drunk in the Mos Eisley Cantina who tried to pick a fight with Luke in _A New Hope_, only to get his ass handed to him by Ben.
-   Dr. Jekyll from _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_, particularly in the original book, where his reason for making the potion was essentially to do bad things and not get caught. His alter-ego, Mr. Hyde, averts this.
    -   Dr. Jekyll was, fittingly, a doctor in two subjects: Medicine and Law. Chapter two reveals he was a M.D. (Doctor of Medicine), a D.C.L. (Doctor of civil law) and a L.L.D, Legum doctor, Doctor of Laws. And before the obligatory Evil Lawyer Joke, those doctorates were truly morally ambiguous: The Medicine Doctorate allowed Dr. Jekyll to prepare the potion that unleashed the completely evil Mr. Hyde, but also let Jekyll do a lot of good in the world helping his patients after his My God, What Have I Done? moment. The Doctorate of Law allowed Jekyll to avoid the Undead Tax Exemption for Mr. Hyde and even helped Hyde to escape the law when Jekyll experimented with an involuntary Split-Personality Takeover, but it also allowed Dr. Jekyll to make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil Hyde has done.
-   Dr. Cable of _Uglies_ is a sadistic Super-Soldier. In _Specials_ she starts a war and almost takes over Tally's city.
-   Victor Vale from _The Villains Series_ is a subversion. As a med student with a vengeful, violent streak, and Mad Scientist tendencies to boot, he'd be a textbook example... except, thanks to an incident that landed him in jail, he was never able to complete his doctorate. He's more than a little annoyed about this. The second book introduces a straight example in Dr. Haverty, who has a penchant for vivisections and experimenting on human beings.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Angel_'s examples run the gamut from fantastical to the creepily mundane, such as Dr. Meltzer, an eye surgeon with animatronic limbs who stalks one of his patients.
    -   Though he only appears in one scene, a "Dr. Gregson" is responsible for surgically removing the heart from James in "Heartthrob". This renders James (a vampire who is bent on avenging his lost love) impervious to stake attacks. Gregson uses his medical practice as a cover for his species' custom of collecting rare organs.
    -   By and large, trusting anyone with a labcoat in Wolfram & Hart is... not a good idea.
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_: Doctor Gaius Baltar. Unwittingly sold out the entire human race to his Cylon girlfriend. Twice. Probably either True Neutral or Neutral Stupid.
-   The Evil Doctor in Season 3 of _Beauty and the Beast_.
-   _The Big Bang Theory_:
    -   It's been noted that Doctor Sheldon Cooper is "one lab accident away from becoming a supervillain". Leonard's mother, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter, can give you the closest thing to Mind Rape a sitcom grounded in something resembling reality can offer via her questionable usage of her psychiatrist skills. Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, while usually seeming to be less likely to snap than her boyfriend and Spear Counterpart Sheldon, has offered to have her lab monkeys kill someone more than once. Dr. Bernadette Rostenkowski-Wolowitz's work for a private pharmaceutical company supposedly curing diseases is also implied to be morally ambiguous — which is scary because she's always smiling.
        
        **Bernadette:** Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold.
        
        **Howard:** Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?
        
    -   The show also lampshaded the prevalence of these in comic books.
        
        **Sheldon:** You know, it's amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate schools should do a better job of screening those people out.
        
-   _Breaking Bad_: Walter White holds a Ph.D. in chemistry, which he uses to become the undisputed meth kingpin of the American Southwest.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Doctor Walsh slid from good to misguided to evil in short order before "being skewered by her own Frankenstein-like creation."
    -   Although he is probably not a true doctor, Doc may be an example.
    -   Also there was a Season 6 villain called "The Doctor" who dealt in transporting violent demons. It turned out to be Spike.
-   _Doctor Who_: The Doctor: Though good, _Trial of a Time Lord: The Ultimate Foe_ reveals that he has the _potential_ to become one of the most evil beings in the universe, and he can certainly stray into Good Is Not Nice territory at times.
    -   Also, exactly _what_ the Doctor got his doctorate in is never stated. Some of the earlier stories seem to indicate that he most likely did _not_ get his degree in medicine (save for a "purely honorary" degree from working under Dr. Lister \[of Listerine fame\]) but in law. As an interesting side note, the word "Valeyard" (the name of the Doctor's prosecutor and potential dark side) is said to mean "a doctor of law." The Eleventh Doctor claims that he has legitimate degrees in medicine and cheese-making (but he's an Unreliable Narrator, so who knows).
-   _The Flash (2014)_ has Dr. Harrison Wells who, although he is Barry's mentor in superheroics and thus technically one of the good guys, is rather prone to Shoot the Dog actions in order to keep Barry safe. He's eventually revealed to be the villainous Reverse Flash, zig-zagging this trope a little as it is unknown whether he also has a doctorate in his true identity as Eobard Thawne.
-   _Fringe_: Dr. Bishop, a mad scientist who specializes in bizarre "fringe science" written off by the rest of the scientific community. Probably Lawful Neutral as he seems to be a member of at least one Ancient Conspiracy.
    -   He does, however, have some (possibly laser guided) amnesia. It's possible that recovery of those memories would return him to a cackling evil mad scientist of epic proportions.
    -   Very, very morally ambiguous indeed. It seems he used to be highly arrogant and not always that concerned about ethics or possible consequences, and that he did do terrible things (including complex drug tests on children). However, it also turns out that most of those terrible things were done with good intentions and that he now feels extremely guilty and tries to atone.
    -   As for the _other_ Dr. Bishop, he's a Well-Intentioned Extremist, which probably makes him a morally ambiguous doctor as well.
-   In _Helix_, this is Implied of all the research scientists who work at the Arctic Biosystems base. All of them hold the title "Doctor," and come there to take advantage of the opportunity to perform research unencumbered by regulatory agencies. Lead researcher Dr. Hiroshi Hatake openly admits that he encourages his people to "push the envelope."
-   Doctor Mohinder Suresh of _Heroes_. A true blue good guy in the first season; evil tendencies started to creep in around the same time he started taking levels in badass in the second season. A screwed-up recipe for homemade Applied Phlebotinum resulted in something a Face–Heel Turn, though. The jury is out on whether he's good or evil.
-   Dr. House: Good, but only because he sees deathly ill patients as big puzzles and can't resist "solving" them: saving lives is viewed as collateral damage; he doesn't bat an eye no matter how bleak the prognosis is. Many of his actions when in the process of treating a patient are incredibly unethical, dangerous, unnecessary, or all of the above, and he makes all his choices based on his own selfish whims, but his seemingly evil actions almost invariably lead to a lifesaving cure for someone who would otherwise have been royally screwed.
-   Ritter Wulf from the Spanish series _El internado_ performed horrific, lethal experiments on children during the Holocaust, and started racial purity experiments at the Laguna Negra boarding school. 60 years later when confronted by Saúl, his only regret is not killing more Jews while he still had the chance.
-   The Big Bad of _The Kagestar_ is a criminal mastermind named Doctor Satan. If his name isn't enough to convince you he's bad, the fact that he's a Nazi scientist should be.
-   There's plenty of heroic scientists in _Kamen Rider_, but that doesn't stop doctors from popping up as villains often.
    -   Doctor Shinigami/Ikadevil was one of the main generals of the original _Kamen Rider_ series.
    -   _Kamen Rider Double_ has Dr. Isaka/Weather Dopant, who actually modified Gaia Memories to kill their users so he could take them and incorporate them and their powers into himself later on, and Dr. Prospect/Eyes Dopant, who performed horrifying experiments on children to turn them into psychics, planned to kill the failed subjects by electrocution, and planted eyes on them to watch them and kill them if they strayed out of the village. Prospect was responsible for the Despair Event Horizon of Katsumi Daido, the antagonist of the first W movie "A-to-Z: Gaia Memories of Fate".
    -   _Kamen Rider OOO_: Dr. Maki, whose obsession with endings led him to allow a bomber to continue his work and, ultimately, turn himself into a Greeed and become the Big Bad with the goal of ending everything except himself.
    -   _Kamen Rider Gaim_ gives us Ryoma Sengoku, who created all of the Drivers in the show. His ultimate goal is godhood, and he will do anything, including throwing the world into anarchy, and murdering someone who possessed the Forbidden Fruit within them, in order to achieve his goals.
-   _Lost_ has Dr. Juliet Burke (initially on the side of the Others, who have the dubious claim of "the good guys"), Dr. Ethan Rom (seems to have been evil, also part of the aforementioned Others).
-   On _M\*A\*S\*H_, Major Frank Burns is an immoral doctor and a _worse_ officer, likely only gaining the latter position because of the former. (One military judge who looks at his record — when Burns attempts to have Hawkeye court-martialed — claims that if Burns hadn't been drafted as a surgeon he likely would be working as a pastry chef.) In fact, a few episodes have hinted (and given straight admissions from Burns) that he cheated his way through medical school. (Of course, ask any actual member of the military, and he'll comment on how unrealistic _every_ character in the series was.)
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_: Doctor Forrester: Evil and goofy.
-   _Nip/Tuck_ has a patient in Season 3, who wants to have his leg amputated. His friend went to see a doctor in Mexico, the terrifyingly named Dr. Carrion.
-   _Power Rangers RPM_'s Dr. K, who was raised by Alphabet Soup operatives for weapons research and development. Although she's technically one of the "good guys," in a textbook case of Nice Job Breaking It, Hero, one weapon she created in particular — the Venjix computer virus — becomes the season's Big Bad after she uploaded the virus to blind Alphabet Soup's security servers in a failed attempt to escape her imprisonment. She spends her life afterwards trying to make up for her mistakes.
-   Borderline-parodied in _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_ "Sabrina the Teenage Writer," with Sabrina's poorly written Bond villain "_Dr. Bad_."
-   Dr. Reston, Elaine's psychiatrist boyfriend from the _Seinfeld_ episode "The Wallet" might count. He seems more interested in controlling people than helping them.
-   The titular Doctor of the Sid & Marty Krofft series _Dr. Shrinker_. His theme song even states that he's a madman with an evil mind.
-   _Smallville_ was the king of this trope. The wiki actually had a page on evil doctors! Metropolis University must be the world's leading college for obtaining a Morally Ambiguous Doctorate, because almost every single doctor appearing on the show is either evil or a Well-Intentioned Extremist doing unethical experiments For Science! (or, y'know, in return for Luthor money). Even a regular medical doctor (Helen Bryce) turned out to be evil in Season 3.
-   Mirror Universe Phlox in the _Star Trek: Enterprise_ episode "In a Mirror, Darkly" where Phlox's role on the ship is still the same but is now a (still odd and gleeful) sadistic expert of medicinal torture.
    -   The EMH on the _Equinox_ on _Star Trek: Voyager_. Since they removed his "ethical subroutines" he's psychopathic. Also, when they removed _Voyager_'s Doctor's ethical subroutines, he was ready to gleefully remove Seven of Nine's brain. This wouldn't be so bad, but he has a crush on her.
    -   Dr. Chaotica, the Mad Scientist villain from _The Adventures of Captain Proton!_ holoprogram.
-   _Super Sentai_:
    -   In _Choudenshi Bioman_, you don't get much more morally ambiguous when you're a Big Bad named _Doctor Man_ whose plan is to kill off the species you once were a part of.
    -   _Choujuu Sentai Liveman_ had _five_ villains who qualified as this, with the Big Bad being named Great Professor Bias and his human students named Dr. Kemp, Dr. Mazenda, Dr. Obular, and Dr. Ashura; all of the students were once regular human students but have augmented themselves biologically or mechanically as a show of their detatchment from their humanity in their selfish pursuit of power and knowledge. Considering Bias's students most likely got their doctorates from him, they may be almost literal examples. Also, while it isn't in their names, the aliens actually robots Guildos and Butchy probably count, as well. While Bias proves to be irredeemable, Kemp goes insane, and Guildos just dies too early, all of them make Heel Face Turns at some point when they find out what Bias is actually up to; even Kemp at the end is able to rebel against Bias after Megumi's words lead him to a Heel Realization about what he has done and how he regrets everthing.
    -   _Chikyuu Sentai Fiveman_: Galactic Scientist Doldora, who works as chief scientist and weapons designer for The Empire.
    -   _Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger_: Dr. Mikoto Nakadai/AbareKiller: Dr. Jerk and a White Ranger... but no heart of gold, and evil since he joins up with the Evolien to get excitement after spening his life bored with his perfection at everything. He did a Heel–Face Turn in the end though, just in time to die but does get a lot better in future appearances.
-   _UFO (1970)_: The vaguely sinister Dr. Doug Jackson appears to fill a number of roles in SHADO, ranging from psychiatrist and medical doctor to prosecuting officer. In one episode Commander Straker calls him "the eyes of the International Astrophysical Committee", implying that Dr. Jackson's role is to spy on him for his superiors (which would explain his wide-ranging brief). This is only enhanced by his noticeable Eastern European accent, which would automatically make the 1970's audience think of Cold War Espionage Tropes.
-   Doctor Dark, Big Bad in the second season of _Who Wants to Be a Superhero??_

    Music 

-   Several of the supervillains from Tom Smith's filk album _The Last Hero On Earth_.
-   They Might Be Giants:
    -   "Doctor Worm": He's not a real doctor, but he is a real worm, he is an actual worm.
    -   "Dr. Sy Fly" is about a deranged, fly-headed doctor with a propensity towards Meat Grinder Surgery.
        
        _He's going to have to amputate  
        He's going to chop off all that you got

        After which he'll play nine holes of golf_
        
-   Lordi: When "Dr. Sin is In", you want to be out.
-   Doctor Steel: No one's sure what he's a doctor of, exactly (he's said he's a Doctor of "Reality Engineering"); but he's bent on taking over the world using an army of robotic toys and brainwashed "toy soldiers" so that he can make the world a better place (for him).
-   Disc jockey Dr. Demento plays some.. interesting.. songs on his show.
    
    "They're coming to take me away, uh-huh. They're coming to take me away, ho ho, heehee, haha, to the funny farm, where life is beautiful _all_ the time and I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats and they're **COMING TO TAKE ME AWAY HAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaa...**"
    
-   Doctor X from Queensrÿche's concept album _Operation: Mindcrime_ has one.

    Podcasts 

-   Supervillains in _Red Panda Adventures_ who call themselves "Doctor" or "Professor" anything typically have the academic credentials to back up the title, such as Adolf Hitler's chief scientific advisor Professor Fredrich von Schlitz. This becomes a plot point in "The Empty Box" when the heroes have to track down a self-proclaimed witch doctor, Professor Hex. Between this trope and the fact most magical practitioners consider the term "witch doctor" offensive enough that they'd never use it to describe themselves, they are able to expose Professor Hex as an entomologist who had been poisoning his victims with a specific breed of fly.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Championship Wrestling From Florida and Georgia Championship Wrestling started being visited by Dr. X in 1969. In Jim Crockett's Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, the evil doctor gimmick was done away with in favor of pairing him up with Mr. X and calling him Mr. X #2.
-   "Dr. Death" Steve Williams. Usually a Heel, always a badass. He didn't come up with the name himself. He was a champion high school wrestler in Oklahoma during the 1970s, but broke his nose once during a match, and came back wearing a hockey mask the next night, with a local sportswriter calling him "Dr. Death."
-   A recurring gimmick in EMLL, though few were more immediately obvious than El Satánico Dr. No, even if he is usually just referred to as El Satánico. More obvious is "El Galeno Del Mal" Dr. Wagner, and his son.
-   Formerly known in Memphis as Downtown Bruno, Bruno Lauer arrived in WWE in 1991 as Dr. Harvey Wippleman.
-   _Kaiju Big Battel_: Dr. Cube. Evil, trying to take over the world with an army of genetically-modified Kaiju.
-   During his heel rapper period, John Cena proclaimed himself "Doctor of Thuganomics".
-   TNA: Dr. Stevie. Evil psychiatrist, has a habit of brainwashing his patients to become his submissive lackeys. Also probably not a real doctor, since his ECW and WWE past is mentioned. Better known as Eugene, Nick Dinsmore has competed for TNA's India partner Ring Ka King as Dr. Nicholas Dinsmore.

    Radio 

-   _Adventures in Odyssey_ had the evil Dr. Regis Blackgaard. Not sure what he's a doctor of. When his "good" identical twin brother Edwin came to town he introduces himself as "Mister"; Lucy, mistaking him for Regis, asked if he had to give the title back because he was evil.
-   In _Round the Horne_, a recurring villain was Doctor Chu-En Ginsberg, M. A. (failed).

    Roleplay 

-   The rather ironically-named Dietrich "Medic" Luzweit in _Dino Attack RPG_ would certainly qualify, being an unstable doctor who nearly lost his medical license after somehow removing a patient's skeleton. The only thing that kept him in action was the fact that a mutant dinosaur apocalypse had just started and there was a desperate need for people with medical training. Averted by just about every _other_ medic in the RPG, though.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Champions_ has the master villain Doctor Destroyer, who actually does have multiple earned doctorates (under his real name). Any adventure he's involved in is likely to end up with dead superheroes.
-   Doctor Mordenheim of Lamordia in the _Ravenloft_ campaign, an Expy of Victor Frankenstein; a Flat-Earth Atheist whose experiments in the creation of life were perceived by the gods as blasphemies, and was cursed by them. He's not the Darklord of Lamordia (his monster, Adam, is the Lord) but he shares the same Ironic Hell.
-   Given _Rocket Age_'s setting, there are many scientists who act... questionably, the Nazis in particular.
-   The _Savage Worlds_ plot point campaign _Necessary Evil_ features Dr. Destruction as the leader of Omega and includes lesser villains like Dr. Devolution. The entry for the last one lampshades the fact that so many supervillains had doctorates.
-   Dr Kholera, from _Spycraft_ fluff: Evil Mad Scientist. Very evil.
-   In _Warhammer_, Skaven scientists mostly make hideous mutants and terrifying war machines, often at the same time.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Fabius Bile, a geneticist who's reduced planets to shambling mutants and created a race of murderous superbeings. In battle, he shoots people with syringes that can make them _explode_. He's also thousands of years old, preserved by Black Magic pumped into his veins, and doesn't worship any of the Chaos Gods despite extensive dealings with them, which may actually be scarier than any of his other accomplishments.
    -   The Dark Eldar Haemonculi, from whom Bile actually learned his skills. They're functionally immortal Mad Scientists that specialise in all kinds of body modifications, from replacing their own blood with acid to turning people into horrible biomechanical abominations. In battle, they wield all sorts of freaky weapons, from guns that fire their own acid blood at enemies to syringe-gauntlets that cause the victim to grow out of their skin and caskets filled with invisible fiends that strip the flesh from their victim's bones.
    -   Ork Mad Doks/Pain Boyz are no more evil, and quite a bit more eccentric than other Orks. Probably Chaotic Neutral if pressed.

    Theatre 

-   _Arsenic and Old Lace_: Dr. Einstein: Evil assistant to an Ax-Crazy serial killer.
-   Older Than Steam: _Doctor Faustus_:
    -   Evil. He sells his soul to the Devil, for Knowledge and Power and Helen of Troy. Very Mad Scientist because Knowledge is one of his goals.
    -   Or, ambiguous: in some versions, he has his 7 years of Glory, and goes to Hell, ha ha ha, serves him right for being Evil. In some versions, Faust is presented as a sympathetic character who wants to be redeemed: when he fails, it is tragic Grand Opera, when he succeeds, it is happy ending Light Opera. Goethe has him as Distracted Neutral if not Chaotic Neutral more than anything else. He sells his soul for knowledge, and most opera versions of Goethe end right after Mephistopheles has done his job by pushing Faust firmly over the Moral Event Horizon. At the end of the second half, after much weirdness, Faust a Heel–Face Turn because he looks around and then gives _himself_ a What the Hell, Hero? speech.
-   Doctor Miracle from act III of _The Tales Of Hoffman._ His plot is to get the sick Antonia to sing herself to death. It takes place in Ancient Greece, so it would've been when the Hippocratic Oath was fairly new.
-   The Doctor from _Woyzeck_. A bit of a Punch-Clock Villain, although he also defenestrates his cat as a hobby. Gets a Villain Song in the rock opera version.

    Toys 

-   Advertisements for the Doctor Dreadful line of toys feature a goofy Mad Scientist named, well, Doctor Dreadful. The line includes the "Doctor Dreadful MD" toys, where the character claims the "MD" stands for "Monster Doctor". (And in one commercial, he produces a sheepskin to prove he is, indeed, a licensed Monster Doctor.)

    Video Games 

-   Sugita Genpaku from _AkaSeka_ may genuinely care for the well-being of his patients, but he is also a Mad Doctor who will try to operate on anyone he could find, even if their condition isn't that serious.
-   _Alice in the Mirrors of Albion_ has Mildred, the head nurse in the Albion hospital whose treatment methods are so horrible that prospective patients would rather try questionable folk remedies than suffer under her care.
-   Dr. Kira from _Arcana Heart_: Evil, Unusually young to have a doctorate, a mix between Doctor Evil and Brain as a little girl.
-   The villain in _Arthur Yahtzee: The Curse of Hell's Cheesecake_ is called Dr. Diablo.
-   _Battleborn_:
    -   With a background of having graduated from Archsciences Academy at the young age of 14, Dr. Beatrix Lucavi is an amoral scientist with a penchant for experimenting on living things.
    -   The moniker used by Thaddeus from the DLC Story Operation "**Toby's Friendship Raid**" in the 8th playthrough of the operation is Dr. Garrius Winglehopper. With the title of doctor accompanying it, the name is clearly styled after those of typical evil mad scientists and the like. Given Thaddeus' habit of constantly changing his name though, the doctor part is obviously just in name only.
-   _BioShock_:
    -   Dr. Suchong: Absolutely mercenary at nature and willing to commit scientific atrocities as long as he's paid well in the end.
    -   Dr. Tenenbaum: Created the Little Sisters and initially ambivalent since it's all For Science!. Eventually develops a maternal instinct and becomes The Atoner.
    -   Dr. Steinman: Lethally experimenting on people in order to satisfy his twisted perception of beauty. Evil and completely out of his mind.
    -   Dr. Lamb from _BioShock 2_ is an Enemy of Free Will and devoted to the destruction of individuality.
    -   Doctors Powell and Pettifog of _BioShock Infinite_, who think nothing of strapping Elizabeth into a painful energy siphon, ignoring her heart-wrenching cries for mercy and coldly torturing your sweet, adorable sidekick for _months_ to break her will. They even privately discuss killing her against the wishes of Big Bad Comstock. When Booker shuts down the siphon and Elizabeth gets the chance to (awesomely) repay their cruelty, the player will likely scoff in disbelief as they panic and urge Booker to turn the siphon back on.
-   _BlazBlue_:
    -   Dr. Litchi Faye-Ling: Good, compassionate, medical doctor, but corrupted with the Boundary, and currently amongst the antagonistic NOL, with Hazama around and her morality is in danger whether it will plummet hard to complete evil thanks to Hazama's influence, or she will retain it and consider it a Dirty Business to save the one she loved and herself.
    -   Relius Clover. Relius. Freaking. **Clover.** While never explicitly stated to have a doctorate, he is a master of science and alchemy, creating clones and Magitek weaponry. He's also a complete sociopath willing to torture people, kill his own wife and daughter and turn their corpses into living weapons, and kill God just to see what happens. He has no 'Doctor' title, but he does have another.
-   _Borderlands_: Dr. Zed: The last person you want near you with anything sharp, but one of the very few people that you can rely on in the Death World that is Pandora. May or may not have somehow been responsible for a Zombie Apocalypse.
    -   And speaking of Zombie Apocalypse, Dr. Ned: Turns out he's a bad guy... who knew?
    -   Possibly a subversion, given that Zed doesn't actually have a medical degree and references this frequently ("who needs one when you've got style?"). In the sequel, he has a rival in Doc Mercy, who, to Zed's frustration, _does_ have a degree, but is also a bandit and far more concerned with making wounds than treating them.

-   _Cave Story_: Dr. Fuyuhiko Date: As evil as they come. Master of the Player Punch. Actually _is_ a medical doctor.
-   _City of Heroes_: Doctor Vahzilok: Dr. Frankenstein turned even more evil and insane and with a veritable army of equally evil followers.
-   Doctor Thrax from _Command & Conquer: Generals_ is quite evil, or at best a religious extremist _a la_ Osama bin Laden. He wants you to tell stories of your defeat to your three-eyed grandchildren. He also wonders if he shouldn't have gotten his degree from a mail-order college. He specializes in bioweapons, especially anthrax.
-   In _The Council of Hanwell_, the Doctor likes to experiment with creatures called "anomalies". For use in the experiments, the Council will only give him prisoners who have been found guilty in a fair trial. When they run out of condemned prisoners, the doctor resorts to kidnapping people off the streets.
-   _Crash Bandicoot_: Doctor Neo Cortex: Evil.
-   _Dead Space_: Dr. Mercer, Challus: Evil, evil, _evil_ bastard. Who passed this guy in medical school?
-   _Deus Ex_: Dr. Jaime Reyes. Good guy. And _Deus Ex: Human Revolution_ has Dr. Megan Reed. The jury is still out, but evidence heavily suggests she's very amoral.
-   _EarthBound (1994)_: Dr. Saturn appears to be well-meaning if eccentric. Even so...
-   _Fallout 3_: In a game filled with sociopaths, Dr. Stanislaus Braun does his best to stand out: As controller and inhabitant of the Vault-112 virtual reality simulations, he has been continually torturing, killing, and reviving the other inhabitants of the simulation for 200 years, just to amuse himself. The only reason he enjoys this is _because they're real people, not just computer programs_; if you Mercy Kill everyone else there so they can't be revived, he'll act like a spoiled 10-year-old and get upset that you took away his toys. The fact that you've doomed him to being stuck alone in the simulation forever doesn't really register. When you get trapped in Vault 112, he offers to let you leave.... but only if you murder everyone else in the vault for his amusement. He's also the guy who designed most if not all of the other Vaults in the Vault Experiment, which goes a long way to explaining why nearly every Vault descended into madness and horror.
-   Yates from _Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark_ is a highly-skilled doctor who will only treat people if he considers them "deserving" or "interestingly afflicted", and he uses necromancy to reanimate dead patients as zombies. He isn’t evil, but he’s definitely amoral.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   _Final Fantasy IV_: Dr. Lugae turned Edge's parents into chimeras before turning himself into a monster. Even Rubicante is appalled by this.
    -   Dr. Hojo from _Final Fantasy VII_. Quite. Crazy. It's hard to find anything he did that is not For Science!. Arguably responsible for _every single calamity_ that happens in FFVII universe.
        -   Except Jenova. She fell before he was born. However, he did contribute greatly to making Jenova problem far worse (can you say Sephiroth)?
    -   _Final Fantasy XII_: Doctor Cid: Mad with power. And very theatrical.
-   The villain in _Flight of the Hummingbird_ is called Dr. Sinister.
-   _God Hand_: Doctor Ion: Evil as per his programming.
-   Dr. Venom from the MSX _Gradius_ games: Evil.
-   Dr. Baldhead, from _Guilty Gear_: Evil, murderous, insane; a medical doctor as well. It's implied that he does a Heel–Face Turn later in the series, but when he does, he changes his name to Faust, dropping the Doctor from his name. However, as he still practices medicine, other characters call him "Dr. Faust".
-   _Half-Life 2_: Dr. Breen, if not evil, then still the willing head of a puppet government.
-   Dr. Repulsor in _Heroes of Newerth_, a grinning goblin obsessed with magnets.
-   The Big Bad of the _James Pond_ series is the evil Dr. Maybe.
-   _League of Legends_ has Dr. Mundo, The madman of Zaun. As stated in his bio: In his eyes, you are already dead.
-   Though never called a doctor outright, you'd have to have a couple doctorates in badass to engineer MULTIPLE plagues which nicely complement each other, as Hakke Dal from _Maken X_ (Maken Shao on Playstation) so capably demonstrated. Also he shows he has no moral compunction against killing his own daughter should you brainjack her to use against him. The reason she was trapped in a psych ward in the first place was that he tested one of the first prototypes of the Uvad virus on her. He'd likely be BFFs with Killjoy above in his college days and may have even roomed with him. Also, he's an oddly black man in a game world full of greys. (Though all Hakkes intend to kill a lot of people to forwards their utopia, Dal seems to be the only one enjoying his work. Margaret is just Ax-Crazy and hopped up on designer drugs like Eugenics and Relativism. Big Bad Geist is actually one of the sanest members of the group, as both he and right-hand Yusef can be diplomatically reasoned within a couple endings, provided you made the appropriate storyline choices.)
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   Dr. Mordin Solus. Before you actually meet him, all you have is a name and the space station he can be found. As you investigate, everyone tells you that he's crazy and that they don't expect you to survive the encounter, the tales getting more horrid every time.
        
        _"He's not just a doctor. Doctors don't execute people and display their bodies as a warning."_
        
    -   When you meet him, he turns out to actually be quite crazy, but seems to be fully aware of what's going on around him and a genuinely nice person. He also seems to be a former member of the salarian Special Tasks Group and has tech powers to burn people alive.
    -   He is also revealed to be one of the leading scientists who spent some time re-engineering the genophage, an incurable genetic disease that causes massive rates of miscarriages in pregnant krogan to keep the numbers of the species low. He's aware that the bioweapon was ethically reprehensible, but does not regret his actions. He mentions that he started the clinic in Omega specifically so that he could do something less morally ambiguous in his twilight years.
    -   He then completely redeems himself in _Mass Effect 3_ by taking the elevator to the top of an exploding weather control tower to release the genophage cure over Tuchanka, humming his song from the previous game, _"I am the very model of a scientist Salarian..."_
    -   Also, Dr. Saleon from the first game. Need spare organs? Grow them in the natural environment of a subject's body!
-   Dr. Keith Fetus from _Meat Boy_ series who is on evil side. In Meat Boy universe, you don't even have to be born to get a university degree.
-   _Mega Man_: Dr. Albert W. Wily: Evil, but his creation Zero wound up fighting for the side of good.
    -   The classic series likes to play with this. Dr. Wily plays it straight, Dr. Cossack subverts it because he was blackmailed into it by Dr. Wily kidnapping his daughter, and Dr. Light not only outright inverts it, but he serves as Dr. Wily's good counterpart.
    -   _Mega Man Zero_: Dr. Weil: Waaaay more evil than Wily could ever hope to be. Definitely among the most evil on this list.
-   In addition to being a hilariously over-the-top Spy Fiction series, _Metal Gear_ deals a lot with questions of ethics in extreme situations. As a result, the series has lots of scientists with highly morally ambiguous pasts and presents.
    -   The prime example in the series and for the trope in general would be _Dr. Naomi Hunter_. She is introduced as the medical advisor for the operation on Shadow Moses, but is actually an agent planted by Ocelot. She murdered people, send people who trusted her into ambushed, and handed vital technology over to the enemy. Then she repents and helps Snake, disappears from prison, joins Ocelot again and develops weapons for him, and then has the guts to ask Snake to rescue her. Then she becomes Otacon's girlfriend and betrays him and Snake by stealing important data for Ocelot, again! She then switches sides again to help Snake a last time and commits suicide. And all the time she seems to be genuinely sorry for what she did but would do the same things again without hesitation. And she never really explains what she is trying to achieve.
    -   _Para-Medic_ starts as a genuinely nice young physician, but somehow got forced to sign up with the team in MGS3 after the events of the Virtuous Mission or would have had her license revoked (although she hints that she intended to do the mission anyways). MGS4 later reveals that she was _Dr. Clark_, who created the clones of Big Boss and made Grey Fox into the Cyborg Ninja against his will. She got killed by Gray Fox as payback for what she did to him, and partially after EVA/Big Mama told him that she was one of Zero's Patriots and told him to kill her.
    -   Also Otacon is in fact _Dr. Hal Emmerich_. While a good guy, he was too naive to realize he was building a superweapon, and after going underground with Snake, he frequently broke into high-security military computer networks to steal intel and blueprints for Snake's gadgets. Even before meeting Snake, he has done a few instances of hacking into high-security networks: One instance was when he hacked the FBI's central database while he was within the Engineering Research Facility branch of the FBI, which got him fired.
    -   Dr. Emmerich, Hal's father, was similar. Although a good guy, he did work with nuclear weapons and was involved in a project to create a perfect deterrent. Although he was initially willing to work on the project, it was only because he legitimately believed Coldman when he said that it wouldn't be used even once. Unfortunately, Coldman proved his lying/insane nature when he intended to launch a live nuke to test its retaliation abilities. By the time of _Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain_, he's betrayed Big Boss and is initially working for Skull Face to build new weapons, such as Walker Gears and Sahelanthropus. And later in the game, he commits an atrocity by engineering parasites as a bioweapon and releasing them on Mother Base.
    -   Strangelove worked with A.I. development, and also did torture Snake, although it is implied that she personally felt disgusted at herself for having to resort to torture. In addition, she intended to create the Mammal Pod so she could revive The Boss, find out what really happened in Operation Snake Eater, and clear her name. Her working to develop the Peace Walker weapon was more or less a necessary evil she had to put up with in order to do it.
    -   "Doktor" from _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_ also displays a rather distressing lack of both regular ethics and medical ethics considering he's supposed to be one of the good guys.
-   One of the villains in _Mystery Trackers 12: Queen of Hearts_ calls himself Doctor Cyanide.
-   Dr. R. Muckly, who you have to rescue from the Viet Cong in _NAM-1975_. It turns out, in a rather screwy manner, that he is a Mad Scientist who wants to use a Kill Sat to take over the world, and so you have to fight him as the game's final boss.
-   _Nintendo Wars_: In a subversion, Mad Scientist and Big Bad Caulder/Stolos from _Advance Wars: Days of Ruin_ is revealed to have been a doctor, but he doesn't use the prefix — he was kicked out of the medical academy for ethical violations. He's just _that_ evil.
-   Dr. Corvine from _Phantasmat 7: Reign of Shadows_ created a monster that only exists in the dark and can destroy _ghosts_.
-   Dr. Zomboss, from _Plants vs. Zombies_. He has a doctorate in Thanotonology.
-   _Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs_: Dr. Edward, aka "Ed the Thinker", legitimately operates as a doctor under the reasoning that when you spend most of your time thinking up evil plots, doing a few good deeds helps keep some balance in your life.
-   _\[PROTOTYPE\]_:
    -   Another Mercer for the list: Dr. Alex Mercer, the real one. Equally evil as Challus.
    -   Dr. McMullen: Evil. Not as much as Mercer, but still evil.
-   _Psychonauts_: Dr. Loboto, who harvests the brains of young psychic children and attempts to put them in psychic-powered tanks. His PhD is in dentistry, however, which makes one wonder why Coach Oleander has him working with brains.
-   _Ratchet & Clank_: Dr. Nefarious. As lampshaded by Captain Qwark in _A Crack In Time_; "In fact, I'm not entirely convinced he's a real doctor!"
-   _Resident Evil_: Dr. William Birkin and Dr. Alexia Ashford: The former being a megalomaniacal scientist who starts getting crazy about his research, which causes people to turn into zombies, and eventually causes the outbreak. This makes it okay to shoot him. The latter is another scientist who is also crazy about her designed virus, but also wants to rule the Earth. This also makes it okay to shoot her.
-   To help out the construction of the Angel Halo in _Shin Super Robot Wars_, Dr. Hell has already killed several humans in the process of perfecting the technique of creating obedient soldiers, or rather, mutilating them horribly enough that death would be preferable.
-   _Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri_:
    -   Dr. Prokhor Zakharov: Not evil, but completely, utterly amoral.
    -   Dr. Shen-Ji Yang: Lawful Evil.
-   _Skullgirls_: Valentine combines this with Battleaxe Nurse. She is frequently seen wanting to experiment on some of the cast's most unusual characters and her fighting style involves a liberal use of medical equipment. And while not a full-on villain, she's one of the most sadistic members of the cast.
-   Dr. M from _Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves_, who used to be The Smart Guy of the gang that Sly's father led. The "doctor" part of his name explains why all of his mooks are Mix-and-Match Critters.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_ has Doctor Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik: Evil. Nobody has any idea what Eggman's doctorate is in. Probably engineering, if the robots he designs are any indication.
-   Played for very dark laughs in _South of Real_. The Knight Templar responsible for all the nightmarish experiments in the mansion and the main character's past is, technically, a doctor. That is, he has a doctorate in the arts.
-   Doctor Killjoy from _The Suffering_, a 1900s level doctor who kills most of his patients in attempts to cure their mental problems. Like Josef Mengele, but British, and he can come back from the dead. EVIL! Still, he apparently has a genuine desire to help Torque with his problems even through extreme means.
-   Zahra from _Suikoden Tierkreis_, who is always a little _too_ excited to examine every non-human specimens in your base.
-   Túsū Wine from _Tale of Food_ studied under Huà Tuó and is a famed and skilled doctor in his own right, but he's also a raging, nasty Jerkass to all his patients even if he tries to help them, and doesn't hesitate turning them away before seeing let alone treating them.
-   Dr. Balfour and Dr. Neis from _Tales of the Abyss_, who between them created fomicry in the form we currently know it. They split sides into good and evil when Balfour who had since been adopted by the Curtiss military family and taken their surname gave up his research and declared a ban on fomicry, but Neis refused to do the same and joined the God-Generals so that he'd have the resources to continue.
-   The Medic of _Team Fortress 2_: Likely a confirmed doctorate, given that most of his team-mates refer to him as "Doctor", "Doc", "Herr Doktor" and the like. Fully aware that healing his team (actually a side-effect of his Medigun) means that they are that much more _efficient_ at killing the other team. By the way, his bio states he never took the Hippocratic oath. And TF Industries still hired him.
    -   Whether or not the Medic has any actual medical training is a Flip-Flop of God. The Medic's old bio states he has no certifiable training or experience (which doesn't mean much as the mercs were not supposed to reveal private info to each other, including each other's real names), while in the 'Meet the Medic" video he casually explains that he actually _lost_ his medical license due to an incident in which his patient lost his entire skeleton. The worst part? He laughs and jokes about it with the Heavy.
    -   The Engineer's backstory says he has 11 Ph.D.s, and he _seems_ to be a much more stable guy, although that's not saying much considering that the flavor text for _The Gunslinger_ is that he chopped his own hand off and replaced it with a robot replacement For Science!.
        -   There's also the fact that the Engineer's domination voice lines are surprisingly vicious and nasty for someone who cultivates a "Texan nice guy" persona. ("I'm a killer of men, Doc, that's the God-honest truth.") We're talking about a guy who builds killer sentry guns for a living and treats them like his children.
    -   And, if we take _Poker Night at the Inventory_ as canon, the Heavy Weapons Guy, of all people, has a PhD as well (granted, it's in Russian Literature, not any of the "hard" sciences, but still). His morality, like all of the other mercenaries, are strictly team-based, and he's definitely not sane, considering he talks to both his food and his guns as if they're alive in his in-game voice lines.
        -   Disproven in the official Valve TF2 comics, in which the Heavy is one of the most stable and smart members of the team. His backstory (in "Meet the Director" and "Cold Day in Hell") clearly shows he works as a merc not because he likes hurting people (although he does not object to it) but to provide money for his elderly mother and three sisters and because of a wish to punish "evil people" (although his definition of evil is pretty utilitarian, "anyone who hurts the people I like").
-   _Tekken_:
    -   Dr. Boskonovitch: Mad Scientist, generally shown somewhat on the side of good (ally of good-guy Yoshimitsu, for one).
    -   Dr. Abel: Evil. What kind of monster tries to blow up an innocent 400lb cybernetic killing machine with no voice? (Seriously... it's complicated. A.I. Is a Crapshoot, folks.)
-   The enigmatic W. D. Gaster from _Undertale_ seems to have one, given the dangerous nature of his creations (like the Core, the machine that caused the fatal accident and his implied connection to Sans' Gaster Blasters (as they are named in the files), as well as the fear certain NPCs express when discussing him.
-   Surprisingly, even _World of Warcraft_ has a few of those. Most of them are undead. However, the two who really stand out (both of them evil) are not. Scholomance boss, human, utterly insane, Doctor Theoden Krastinov (doesn't help that his title is "The Butcher"). More badass, gnome Dr. Weavil, obviously a blatant parody of Dr. Evil. He even has a minion called Number Two. No Mini-Me unfortunately...
-   Dr. Johannsen from _XIII_. Evil member of the XX conspiracy. Incidentally, arguably a harder boss than the next six bosses or so — apparently, doctors can be total killing machines.

    Visual Novels 

-   Dr. Shuu Iwamine from _Hatoful Boyfriend_ is often described as creepy by other characters, and with good reason. It turns out that his crimes vary from murdering various students, to forcing Nageki to murder innocent humans against his will, to _plotting the extinction of the human race_. He very nearly succeeds at that last one, too...
-   Dr. Ogai, in _Saya no Uta_. He apparently brought Saya to Earth and didn't really care if she eventually caused The End of the World as We Know It. He's the only human being in the story who can see her true form without going mad, and even names her for his deceased cat.
-   The titular doctor in _Therapy with Dr. Albert Krueger_ uses his therapy sessions to recruit for his dream eater army and kills patients he deems unsatisfactory. His doctorate isn't even in psychology or psychiatry—it's in _marine biology_.

    Web Animation 

-   The titular character of _Dr. Crafty_ actually does have a legitimate PhD; he's just not the one who earned it originally.
-   _Dr. Tran_: _Here Comes Dr. Tran!_
    
    "I am not a doctor!"  
    "He's a _real doctor!"_
    
-   _Bogleech_: Most of the main characters in The Fear Hole fall under this category, with some notable highlights including the Turkey Tree (It cures world Hunger! By eating people...), the Nanny bomb (It causes cancer... in pedophiles!), Professor Mellancholly shooting the adorable and childlike Antagonizer in the head and I THINK WE'LL LET THE CROCTOPUS DECIDE!
-   _The Gmod Idiot Box_ has Dr. Hax, an Artificial Human clone of Dr. Breen, who ruthlessly destroys all cheaters and hackers by launching monitors and applying the banhammer.

-   _RWBY_ has Dr. Arthur Watts, the technological expert lackey of the Big Bad.
-   Doctor Evil Congressman from _Society of Virtue_.
-   _Spoilsbury Toast Boy_: Dr. Jill, who prescribes death by drowning to cure a stuffy nose.

    Webcomics 

-   _8-Bit Theater_: Doctor Malpractice: Uh, you figure it out. In the employ of Chancellor Usurper no less.
-   _Ansem Retort_'s Dr. Zexion Doreone: A complete and utter Jerkass who once implanted an Oreo in one of his patients for no apparent reason; the Oreo fused with his DNA somehow, so the patient became half-man, half-cookie. He also planted a firecracker in Riku's liver, fashioned a new heart for Riku out of bendy-straws and a Hot Pocket, and replaced another guy's lung with a monkey's ass. Then there's the fact that during his time as Governor, he's been implicated in 5 sex scandals and 3 murder scandals. The only other person on the cast who likes him is Axel, who happens to be a sociopathic serial killer. Everyone else puts up with him only cause he's part of the cast.
-   The _Batman: Wayne Family Adventures_ episode "PhD" centers around Robin pointing out how a large amount of villains in Gotham have doctorate degrees, leading to a discussion regarding the correlation between higher education and supervillainy. Red Robin and Spoiler propose the idea that misguided people end up being pushed by their anti-social personalities to pursue higher learning, giving them the knowledge to conduct villainous experiments. This leads Robin to the conclusion that education is evil and that he doesn't need to go to school. Batman objects to that last part.
-   Dr. X of _Casey and Andy_. Evil. Goal: conquest of all Earth. Managed to conquer France once.
-   Dr. Hayter and the Ixzerite doctor at the Walnut Grove Health Center Victor's mom took him to see from _Charby the Vampirate_.
-   _Crossover Wars_: Dr. Catastrophe... although he was a respected scientist before being recruited to be an Evil Overlord.
-   In _Cuanta Vida_, the Blue Doctor is insane and many of his teammates don't want to get treatment from him or people will fetch his patients after the procedure to keep the doctor from performing "extra tests". He kills Liam and tries to kill Jeremy for being crippled and, in his opinion, useless. If he kills them, they would have been replaced.
-   Doctor Ink of _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_: His intro comic sets the tone for most, if not all, his appearances.
-   Dr. Aloysius Luprand seems to exist mainly to torment his roommate, but once in a while the puppy puts his knowledge to use. And then it gets creepy.
-   _Dr. Nonami_: Dr. Mechano is an evil madman.
-   _El Goonish Shive_: Dr. Germahn: Started as Mr. Exposition, although the role's been taken by others. Also technically doesn't exist in continuity.
-   _Everyday Heroes_ features Dr. Unpleasant, Dr. Gene Gromene, Dr. "Dark Anne" Troubled, and maybe more. It's not yet certain whether the Big Bad, Doc Tormentor, is an actual doctor or not.
    -   Played with when a wannabe supervillain comes up with the moniker "Dr. Destruction" but gets shot down because he doesn't actually have a doctorate.
-   _Follower_: Dr. Tolio. His character bio mentions an incident that ended with him being offered the choice between working for the FBI or life imprisonment. He also seems fully supportive of using the Chio as Super Soldiers.
-   _Girl Genius_: Almost any Doctor introduced. Hell, almost anybody introduced, often played with for laughs.
-   _Hanna Is Not a Boy's Name_: Doc Worth hasn't even actually got a doctorate; he dropped out of medical school. He doesn't let that stop him practicing medicine, and he's also terribly shady just generally. Hanna even implies that he developed a crush on Conrad because Conrad beat him up. And then there's Hanna's freaking torso, and the "classified" procedure Worth decides Hanna needs after being attacked by a ghost. It seems to be working out all right for Hanna, so, cool, but, also, WTF.
-   _Homestuck_'s Doc Scratch is an excellent host.
-   _Last Res0rt_: Dr. Daisy Archanis: Well, at least _Jason_ thinks she's evil... given that she's accused of / confessed during torture to taking down the Galaxy Girl Scouts, he might be onto something.
    -   Likewise, Dr. Qin Xu IS a vampire... and while that may not be enough, he's already admitted that he used to snack on his coworkers. So, y'know...
-   _Minions At Work_ supervillains include Doctor Coldblood. Who hates all mammals. Well, _almost_ all.
-   Dr. Edward Upton from _Misfile_, the protagonist’s father. He's a gynecologist who tends to creep out Ash's friends by remembering the details of their... ahem... girl parts.
-   Subverted/averted by _Nailbat_'s resident mad scientist, _Mister_ Simian. This trope is, in fact, lampshaded in the author commentary on the page of his first appearance.
-   Doctor Helen Narbon of _Narbonic_ is Evil with a capital E. Her clone "Beta" (the one who normally goes by "Helen" instead of "doctor Narbon") is less evil (she has her moments...) and never finished her doctorate.
-   Dr. Shark from _The Non-Adventures of Wonderella_ is introduced as your typical mad scientist bent on wreaking havoc. From that point on, though, it's zigzagged, with him only occasionally being villainous, and usually nicer and more ethical than the heroine herself.
-   In-story example in _Questionable Content_:
    
    **Jimbo**: Oh man, I gotta write that down. 'Doctor Heteronormative' would be a BITCHIN' name for the main villain dude.
    
-   In _Recursion_, Dr. Deathe is painfully aware of this trope, and insists that her name is pronounced "deeth" in order to avoid it sounding like, in her own words, "some kind of monster". "Doctor Death" _would_ be a good moniker for her, though, since she did once wipe out half the population of Kass in an effort to scare the other half into accepting her species-wide eugenics program.
-   The facility in which the entire story of _Ruby Quest_ takes place in, known as The Metal Glen, was — in a nutshell — built out of an odd, isolated, geological formation from out in the middle of a secluded loch for the specific purpose of doctors and medical researchers practicing/ testing treatments<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  without the need of the proper permits, license, or the possibility of criminal prosecution.
-   Played with in this episode of _Shortpacked!_.
-   _Sluggy Freelance_: Doctor Steve (megalomaniac, brainwasher, and Cloud Cuckoo Lander), Doctor Crabtree (killing and experimenting on people For Science!), and eventually Doctor Schlock (coward turned megalomaniac).
-   Dr. Universe from _Spinnerette_ — perhaps not evil so much as a Wild Card, but with a definite tendency to the terrifyingly... pragmatic.
-   _Stick Man Stick Man_: Doctor Max Destruction: a real doctor with a degree in astronomy (which entitles him to call himself 'Master of Space').
-   Marissa from _Sturgeon's Law_ has one, as she insists on pointing out at every opportunity.
-   In _Trevor (2020)_, Dr. Maddison bitterly refers to the other members of the medical team as "sadists with medical licenses" because of the experiments that they've been doing, although he's only somewhat right about some of them.
-   _Vigil_: Myriam seems to be a fairly benign version. She doesn't actually have a degree, due to being kicked out of medical school for failing the psychological test. And she's learned most of what she knows by robbing graves.
-   Chastopher from _Zoophobia_ is the Z.P. Academy's nurse, despite being, well...

    Web Original 

-   _SCP Foundation_:
    -   SCP-231 is a woman who can only be attended by medical personnel who haven't taken the Hippocratic Oath. Why? Because she has to be permanently strapped to a hospital bed, and once daily she has to be subjected to a medical procedure so horrific that most of the details can't be disclosed or else she gives birth to..._something_ which could cause untold death and destruction.
    -   Dr. Wondertainment, a person or organization dedicated to creating ridiculously dangerous toys and distributing them among children. Apparently more oblivious than evil.
-   Supervillains (and some superheroes) in the _Whateley Universe_ who don't actually _earn_ their degrees are generally the subject of derision and spite from anyone who actually has. Most of the B-list or higher supervillains with "Doctor" in their title, most notably Doctor Diabolik, actually have their bona fides, so putting that in one's codename just to seem more evil is seen as the work of an unimaginative poseur.

    Web Videos 

-   Dr. Insano's brother, Dr. Linksano of _Atop the Fourth Wall_, has now been created due to a crossing of parallel dimensions brought on by Dr. Insano during the Spoony-Linkara review of _Warrior #1._ The sequel to said review introduces the Insano equivalents of several Channel Awesome regulars, including The Nostalgia Critic, Film Brain, and... Beary (who uses a mind-controlled Benzaie to get around).
-   _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_: Dr. Horrible repeatedly informs us he has "a Ph.D. in Horribleness", even though he is a Technical Pacifist who pretty steadfastly refuses to endanger children and balks at killing.
    -   At least until Penny dies, at which point he starts playing this trope _dead straight_.
        -   Actually, this trope is deconstructed: He only becomes evil because Captain Hammer thinks all smart and nerdy guys are evil, and thusly treated him as a villain even when he was not yet one, so he became a villain because he was seen as a one anyway. And he is still better than Captain Hammer.
-   _KateModern_:
    -   Dr. William Griffin: Good, but formerly evil.
    -   Dr. Reece and Dr. Kavorkian: Presumably evil, but harmless.
-   _LG15: the resistance_: Dr. Leonard J. Alderman: Evil.
-   _lonelygirl15_: Dr. Calvin Hart: Debatably good, but fairly creepy.
-   The Outside Xbox crew often make jokes based on this trope. Possibly the best example, from their playthrough of _Cities: Skylines_, was a hospital named Dr. Andy's Horrortorium.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Dr. Insano of _The Spoony Experiment_, nemesis of Linkara and alter ego of Spoony. His running mate is Fu Manchu. And he wants to take the world (of course!)... WITH SCIENCE!!!!
-   _Unwanted Houseguest_: Doctor Litchfield. His medical license was actually revoked long ago, but there's no indication that his University rescinded his degree.

    Western Animation 

-   _Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers_: Dr. Owen Negata of BETA. Casually talking about using a teenaged boy as a control for a genetic experiment will land you here. Funny thing, he's considered one of the _good_ guys. GR could be a real Crapsack World.
-   _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_: Doctor Weird: Utterly insane. The same could just as easily be said for Doctor Wongburger.
-   _Archer_: Dr. Algernop Krieger. Batshit insane and possibly a clone of Adolf Hitler (Nope. The fact that he looks nothing like Hitler was the first clue). Once mentioned that he is Not That Kind of Doctor and, technically, not the other kind of doctor.
-   Clearly referenced in the _Arthur_ episode "Elwood City Turns 100!" When the class is being handed their roles in the town's centennial play, Buster misreads "Director" as "Dr. Ector" and immediately assumes he's the villain. And has a claw. When Buster later makes a surprise appearance on stage as an alien named Dr. Ector, he's not villainous, just oddly obsessed with dental hygiene. It Makes Sense in Context.
    -   Parodied in the "Dark Bunny" TV show. His arch-enemy is the "Doctapus," an octopus who apparently went to college and earned a doctorate.
-   _Captain Planet and the Planeteers_: Doctor Blight: Usually evil for the cash, the looks, or the fame, sometimes evil for the sake of being so.
    -   Duke Nukem also had a doctorate of some ill-defined sort. It's implied he's a walking radioactive rock because of his experiments, and Kwame calls him Dr. Duke Nukem once or twice.
-   _Challenge Of The Go Bots_ had Dr. Braxis, a Mad Scientist who allied with the Renegade Go-Bots. In the pilot mini-series, Dr. Braxis figured out a way to control human minds worldwide.
-   Professor Norton Nimnul in _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_. Then again, he may actually have obtained a physics degree and gone nuts afterwards. Some (chronologically) early episodes show him trying to sell alternative energy sources ranging from animal cruelty to danger to the public. That said, some of his later inventions could have earned him a fortune, had he tried to sell them instead of using them for criminal purposes. Nonetheless, you do _not_ want him to teach at universities.
-   Dr. Fossil, a one-time villain from _Darkwing Duck_: Evil.
    -   Dr. Reginald Bushroot: Evil, if a bit of a Woobie. (And the reason he turned evil was because of his two Jerkass co-workers, Dr. Larson and Dr. Gary.)
-   _Futurama_:
    -   Professor Hubert Farnsworth: Senile to the point of insanity, but mostly harmless. Has a penchant for creating doomsday devices, only keeps Amy around because she's his blood type, tries to harvest Leela's organs, is implied to be a cannibal, implanted Hitler's brain in the body of a shark, killed people for their stem cells, has been frequently cited for public nudity, and frequently, knowingly sends his crew on life-threatening adventures without warning, to the point of hiring replacements even before their demises are confirmed. In his youth, he created the modern robot, an ecological disaster. Opposed the legalization of Robosexual marriages, but eventually changed his mind.
    -   Averted by Amy Wong, who was finally awarded her doctorate in Season 6. Somewhat ditzy, but generally good.

-   Gorillaz bassist Murdoc Niccals earned a doctorate from an Open University course when in jail in Mexico. He claims he is now "legally entitled to experiment on monkeys".
-   Applies to _Harley Quinn (2019)_, set in The DCU where mad scientists and doctors abound.
    -   Downplayed with Harley and Ivy, who are both "doctors" — Harley is a psychologist and Ivy is a biochemist<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . However, while they are Anti Villains, their skills in their fields are never used to paint them as _evil_ — Harley made some breakthroughs with the Arkham patients, and the one time Ivy is seen doing science it's to save fellow scientist Mr. Freeze's wife's life.
    -   Parodied when Doctor Psycho tries to contact Darkseid on his phone. He scrolls through quite a few villainous "Doctors" before finding him. Riddler doesn't recognize one and asks who he is.
        
        **Doctor Psycho**: My dermatologist. I have adult acne.
        

-   In the _Justice League_ episode "Only a Dream", a Dream Weaver calling himself Dr. Destiny goes after the League. He gave himself the title; it wasn't granted by an authority.
-   _Kim Possible_: Doctor Drakken: Evil, but not especially dangerous. Not surprising given that he was a college dropout and therefore possesses no degree.
    -   Professor Dementor. Somewhat more competent than Drakken, who would rather steal his inventions than invent his own.
-   The witch doctor Dr. I.C. Spots from the _Looney Tunes_ short "Which is Witch" is Laughably Evil.
-   Professor Evil Professor from the _Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero_ episode "I'm Still Super!" has an actual PhD in Villainy.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_: Dr. Doofenshmirtz is evil, yet also incompetent. Sometimes Perry the Platypus doesn't even have to get involved to thwart his schemes; Doofenshmirtz once got beaten by a _potted plant_! It turns out he isn't actually a doctor, he just uses the title. His own daughter pointed out that his diploma was fake.
    
    **Vanessa:** Doctor? Since when are you a _doctor_?
    
    **Doofenshmirtz:** _(shows diploma)_ They don't give these out to just _anyone_, you know.
    
    **Vanessa:** _(reveals price tag)_ Anyone with fifteen bucks, they do.
    
    **Doofenshmirtz:** That's enough looking!
    
-   Herr Doktor from _ReBoot_. Obediently Evil. Whenever Megabyte needs to have something nasty done to a prisoner, this is the binome for the job.
-   Doctor Doctor is the most recurring villain from _The Secret Show_'s Rogues Gallery, a Mad Scientist and the leader of the organization T.H.E.M. (The Horrible Evil Menace), who is set to conquer U.Z.Z. and the world with her devices.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Dr. Nick Riviera, aka "Dr. Nick". Not truly evil, but clearly missing a few marbles, something his patients often suffer as a result of. He actually went to medical school (proven by a flashback) but it isn't known if he actually graduated, and while he practices medicine, he uses controversial and often illegal methods. To give some examples, in one episode a hospital review board brings up the accusations against him which include performing surgery with a knife and fork from a seafood restaurant and misuse of cadavers (he had put them in his car in order to use the carpool lane and get to work quicker). In another episode, he is asked to talk to the coroner, and he says, "Ugh, the coroner. I'm so _sick_ of that guy!" suggesting his patients get sent there rather often. (Ironically, this is the episode where Nick does Homer's double bypass surgery, and Nick actually does it right, but Lisa helps him a little.)
        
        **Dr. Nick:** Well, if isn't my old friend, Mister McGreg! With a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg!
        
    -   Dr. Julius Hibbert, post-Flanderization, can also qualify as being weaselly, up to the point where you may argue he's sort of evil. Originally, Hibbert was one of the few competent people in Springfield and often played the role of Only Sane Man, but Hibbert eventually became a doctor who seems to spend more time finding ways to have his patients sign away their right to sue before the inevitable malpractice issue than actually being a quality doctor. And he also profited heavily when all companies in Springfield eliminated their health care programs, forcing people to pay at a premium. Likely his most immoral action (by the standards of Real Life medicine) was approving of an obviously unhealthy eating contest (as it was in a restaurant he held half-ownership of) where one contestant actually died of beef poisoning and then claiming it was caused by another restaurant. That's not even getting into the fact that he obscurely offered to help _sell_ Maggie when Marge revealed she wasn't sure she could afford a third child. A Bait-and-Switch gag implies that he's been practicing medicine without a license, as he's shown gulping nervously when Bart and Lisa start putting out the town's secrets over the radio but ultimately finger Homer.
    -   "The Man Who Grew Too Much" reveals that Sideshow Bob has a Ph.D, and uses it to genetically enhance his own DNA, giving himself animal-themed superpowers.
-   Dr. Five Eyes from _Skysurfer Strike Force_.
-   _The Smurfs (1981)_ has Dr. Charlatan, who is really a Snake Oil Salesman.
-   Dr. Eggman from _Sonic Boom_. Evil, only kinda harmless. The episode "Mister Eggman" reveals he actually didn't get his doctorate in Evil Science, so he went back and got his degree since without, everyone started calling him Mr. Eggman, which was a bit less intimidating.
-   _South Park_: Professor Chaos: Evil, but harmless. Not actually a professor, but rather Butters wearing tinfoil.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_: Dr. Nuvo Vindi: Crazy and evil and more than willing to revive a former galaxy-wide plague virus just because he could.
-   _Street Sharks_: Doctor Paradigm: Crazy but his experiments don't always make much sense. Is obsessed with gene-slamming everyone and anyone he can get a hold of. Then there's Doctor Bolton, who's a really nice guy but is forced to go into hiding for most of the series, after getting an injection and experiencing some Body Horror.
-   Professor Chromedome from _The Tick_ is not only proud of being this, but he also calls out some other mad scientists at a convention for not being morally ambiguous enough!
    
    **Chromedome:** Bah! More varm fuzzy nice-nice! Vot good is science if no one gets hurt?! You should all be ashamed of yourselves!!! Vat vith your vorld peace und your moccasin valking und your potpourri! You are not mad scientists; **you are a bunch of hippies!!!**
    
-   Not to be outdone, the _Transformers Generation 1_ cartoon 3-parter "The Ultimate Doom" had Doctor Arkeville<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , the self-proclaimed evil genius who assisted the Decepticons in developing a microchip that could control human minds.
-   Speaking of _Transformers_, _Rescue Bots_ features the amoral, scheming, self-aggrandizing Doctor Thaddeus Morocco, voiced by Tim Curry.
-   _The Venture Bros._:
    -   Doctor Thaddeus "Rusty" Venture: Kinda Good. He isn't plotting world domination or looking for dogs to kick, but he is a bitter grouch at the center of a Sadist Show. And he did once build a wish-fulfillment machine that was powered by the heart of an orphan... and then there was the bit with reanimating the corpses of his enemies (and implied killing of the cloned bodies of his children) and selling them to the army. He isn't actually a doctor.
    -   Doctor Jonas Venture Sr.: Presented himself as good, but more and more is revealed to have been evil. He stayed on the side of good to keep his fame and fortune secure but was almost totally amoral in his personal life. Jonas was a frequent philanderer and was implied (and proven, in some cases) to have impregnated his friends' wives. He also held his own son Rusty in complete disregard, totally forgetting about him at best and using him as a guinea pig for dangerous experiments at worst. Additionally, he was not above blackmailing his friends into doing his dirty work. Even Jonas' successes in science are shown to be inspired by his poor impulse control, and were all later either tarted up for sale on the market (without much safety or quality control testing) or completely abandoned after losing interest.
    -   Doctor Jonas Venture Jr.: Good. He entered the superscience career completely believing his father's (hypocritical) messages of peacefully advancing mankind through science and technology, and used his own resourcefulness, charm, and motivation to totally surpass Rusty's career in a fraction of the time. His only negative traits were his smugness (mainly toward Rusty) and his tendency to get totally wrapped up in projects.
    -   Doctor Byron Orpheus: Good, but obnoxious and overbearing, and not above mind-wiping his own daughter repeatedly so she'll forget that her closet is the doorway to the underworld. He has a degree in Communications with a minor in Women's Studies, but accredits his doctor title to a higher power.
    -   The Phantom Limb was a professor before his lab-accident-powered Face–Heel Turn, and likely had a doctorate.
    -   Doctor Girlfriend/Doctor Mrs. The Monarch: Not only evil, but better at it than the Monarch himself. She acts as a moderating force on him, but if you assume that means she's secretly good you are sadly mistaken. It is later revealed her Doctorate is Honorary from donating money to an Evil College.
    -   Doctor Richard Impossible: Evil, and a similar case as Jonas Sr.: He starts out a trusted and renowned scientist, yet a total monster in his personal life. Richard's idea of clean energy is to use Cody's (incredibly painful) Man on Fire powers as a fuel source. He also had no qualms about murdering Rusty — not for hitting on his wife, but for trying to access off-limits sections of his facility. By Season 4, Sally's divorce with Richard pushes him completely off the deep end, and he sheds any preconceptions of being a good guy.
    -   Doctor Z: Affably Evil Card-Carrying Villain. Basically Dr Zin from _Jonny Quest_, but semi-retired. Pretty nefarious in his day, though.
    -   Averted with Dr. Billy Quizboy, despite his ethical sins of practicing medicine without a license (he eventually got one... via dubious means) and doing the sorts of surgeries that would make any Mad Doctor proud. He's one of the show's most morally decent characters (innocent enough to have once earnestly asked Dr. Venture if good really always triumphs over evil), it's just his specialty includes things like grafting a pony's face onto a human abdomen or adding one guy's head onto another guy's body.
    -   Professor Mike Sorayama and Think Tank (aka Dr. Nidaba), both evil professors. Think Tank is very Affably Evil, though, and he's a philosophy professor rather than anything science-y. Subverted with Professor Victor Von Helping, who's pretty close to Bad Powers, Good People (his powers aren't necessarily evil, but they're super-scary), but who deliberately rejected his father's evil ways.
-   Dr. Screwball Jones from _Wander over Yonder_ has an online PhD in cartoonish supervillainy, and does not take lightly to having his title ignored.
    
    **Wander:** Screwball, you try too hard!  
    **Dr. Screwball Jones:** _Doctor_ Screwball, if you please!  
    I've got an online PhD!
