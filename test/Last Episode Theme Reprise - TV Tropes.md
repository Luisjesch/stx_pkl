Since it's standard practice to make a Theme Song as awesome as possible, said theme likes to find its way into a privileged position in the final battle. At The Climax of the series, when things are at their most epic, the theme gets played over the show itself. Typically we'll get to hear the verses not played in the opening, and sometimes the whole song is strung together for once.

The opening or closing theme can be used. Often this serves as an ultimate Theme Music Power-Up. Often it serves in this capacity for the _show itself_.

This is also common in Video Games, the most common being a reprisal or orchestral version of the main theme over the final dungeon or ending sequences.

Sub-Trope of Title Theme Drop. Related to Diegetic Soundtrack Usage, where the theme is shown to exist in-universe. Compare Theme Music Withholding, when the theme song of the franchise as a whole is saved for an epic moment.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Cowboy Bebop_ plays "See You Space Cowboy", an alternate-lyric cut of "The Real Folk Blues", as Spike goes to face off against Vicious in the last episode.
-   _The Twelve Kingdoms_ plays "Getsumei-fuuei" at the end of Episode 39, which finishes the last major story arc. However, that episode is a Series Fauxnale, as there are still six more episodes to go.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_, with "Sorairo Days" during the climax of the final battle. While it's not the first anime to do this trope, it may have been the first to make the trope incredibly popular in action anime.
    -   An inverted case happens earlier. The song "Happily Ever After" is used as Simon's Theme Music Powerup in episodes 11 and 15, then becomes the closing theme tune in episode 16.
-   _Kill la Kill_ plays its second opening, "Ambiguous" during the final battle with Ragyo at Honnouji Academy.
    -   Even more notably, just as Ryuko blasts off into space to face Ragyo for the final time in the last episode, the chorus of the _first_ opening, "Sirius", plays.
-   _The King's Avatar_: In season 1, it happens in the final flashback on the beginnings of the rivalry between Ye Xiu and Han Wenqing.
-   Technically it's only the fourth-last episode, but it still counts when the extended mix of Yuusha Oh Tanjou kicks in for the final battle against the Primevals over Jupiter in _GaoGaiGar_.
-   _Lucky Star_, "Motteke! Sailor Fuku", a Dancing Theme, is used as the BGM to the cheerleader routine in the final episode.
-   _Magic User's Club_
-   Although the theme song 'Rondo Revolution' _didn't_ play during the last episode of _Revolutionary Girl Utena_, the song 'Rose and Release', sung to a similar tune, was. This trope was played straight with _Adolescence of Utena_, which could be considered a finale to the series in many ways.

-   Happens in both season 1 and 2 of _Shakugan no Shana_ and used best in the very final battle of the final season.
-   The first opening song for _Full Moon_ is used for exactly six episodes than abruptly dropped for the rest of the fifty-episode series. This comes off as jarring, considering Mitsuki's musical repertoire literally consists of about three songs and she knows how to sing this one. It's brought back for effect for the last several minutes of the final episode.
-   In Japanese, "Moonlight Densetsu" plays in the first-season finale of _Sailor Moon_. (However butchered the rest of that episode was, most North American fans prefer the DiC dub song, "Carry On").
    -   _Sailor Moon_ does it again in the finale of the last season, using the "Sailor Stars" opening theme during the final battle against Galaxia. Then as the special end credits of the finale roll, the original opening theme plays once more.
-   _Gundam_:
    -   _Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam_ features a slower version of its opening tune at the end of its final episode.
    -   _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_'s first opening song, "Flying High in the Sky", is used as the closing theme of the final episode.

-   _Space Battleship Yamato_, a.k.a. _Star Blazers_, did this a bunch with its opening theme being reprised as a slow violin-heavy instrumental towards the end of each season and in the movies.
-   The end of the last episode of _Neon Genesis Evangelion_', including the infamous "Congratulations!" scene, is accompanied by two different instrumental versions of its opening, "Cruel Angel's Thesis".
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   The final episode of _Dragon Ball GT_ plays the anime's opening theme "Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku" as Goku reminisce his life.
    -   The final episode of the original run of _Dragon Ball Z Kai_ featured a full version of the show's opening theme, "Dragon Soul." For "The Final Chapters" season's final episode, it featured a cover of "CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA" from _Dragon Ball Z_ as Goku takes off to take Uub as his pupil.
-   _Slayers Evolution-R_ does this with the second season's theme song "Give a Reason" during the final battle of the fifth season.

-   _Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood_ uses the second opening "Hologram" over the final episode's picture montage.
    -   An earlier episode also had a longer version of the ending theme, with the credits sequence intercut with part of the show (was it flashbacks?)
-   _F-Zero: GP Legend_ used the opening theme during the final climactic scene. The song used for this was "The Meaning of Truth" by Hiro-X.
-   _Cardfight!! Vanguard_ used this during the endgame phase between Aichi and Ren. The song used for that was "Believe in My Existance". The second opening to the series by JAM Project.
-   The _Bomberman Jetters_ anime used this in the last episode during the picnic scene after the series climax. The song used was "Boku Wa Gakeppuchi". The first opening to the series by Hideo Suwa.
-   _ARIA_ uses the opening theme from its first season in the last episode of... the third season.
-   The second season finale of _Minami-ke_ used the opening theme from the first season in the climactic Group Hug scene.
-   Inverted in two senses in _Ga-Rei -Zero-_, where "Paradise Lost" is put as the ending theme in the _third_ episode, _before_ being used as the official opening theme from episode 4 on.

-   The final episode of _Daily Lives of High School Boys_ has the series' theme song played one last time over the ending credits.
-   The _Kids on the Slope_ finale has two instances. First, Sentaro and Kaoru play "Moanin", the jazz standard they played together in the first episode, and then "Sakamichi no Melody", the series' opening theme, plays over the end credits.
-   The final episode of the first season of _A Certain Scientific Railgun_ does with both the first and second opening themes.
-   _The World God Only Knows_ uses the theme as Background Music for the last TWO episodes.
    -   Not quite as repetitive as one might expect, as this is an 8-minute song which is varied to say the least.

-   _Buso Renkin_'s finale featured a reprise by the opening theme _and_ the first ending theme.
-   _Eureka Seven_ has the theme playing for the last-minute rescue on the last episode.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_ has the second verse of the current opening, "Road to Tomorrow ~Going my Way!!~" playing during Yusei's last turn of the final episode.
-   The English dub of _Pokémon: The Series_ ended the first and thirteenth seasons this way. In both cases, the extended version of that season's theme was used.
-   Inverted in _Umi Monogatari_, as the theme plays at the beginning of the last episode in a more somber tone as Marin and Kanon are near death.
-   _Nurarihyon No Mago_ season 2 played the first opening theme of the season during the final attack of the last battle.
-   _Macross Frontier_ has its original theme song "Triangler" reprise over the epilogue, which also serves as the ending credits, only this time sung by the two lead females. Being a song about a Love Triangle in a _SHOW_ about a Love Triangle, this could be expected. Of course, the original show _never actually resolved_ said Love Triangle.
-   _Witchblade_ switched its opening theme song for the last half of the series. The original opening theme song _XTC_ comes back for the final episode, along with a new ending theme song by the same band.
-   _Steins;Gate_ uses the opening theme for the video game it was based on in the scene of Heroic Resolve when Okabe discovers how to save the world in the penultimate episode.
-   In the last scene of the first season of _Bakuman。_, the full version of the opening theme plays. Earlier in the episode, as the serialization meeting begins, the full version of the second ending plays.
-   In the last scenes of _My-HiME_, "Shining Days" plays. The extended ending has a "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue of sorts, with the full version playing over clips of the cast members. Both this show and _My-Otome_ also pull a variation of this trope by giving the finale the same _title_ as the opening theme.
-   In the Japanese versions of _Digimon_:
    -   _Digimon Adventure_ has Butterfly replay in the final moments of the last episode as the Chosen Children leave the Digital World on the trolley, waving goodbye to their partners. The theme also plays during the epilogue scene of _Digimon Adventure 02_, when the whole main cast of both seasons are shown visiting the Digital World with their children.
    -   In the penultimate episode of _Digimon Tamers_, Biggest Dreamer plays as the Tamers make a last stand against the D-Reaper.
-   The anime of _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ used "Sono Chi no Sadame", the show's first intro (which had been phased out after the end of the "Phantom Blood" arc) during "Battle Tendency"'s final moments in the battle against Kars, as Joseph sends him into space.
    -   "Diamond is Unbreakable" features an even bigger one, as the "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue is underscored by a remix of "Great Days" (the series' final opening theme) performed by the singers for _**all**_ of the _JoJo_ theme songs up to that point.
    -   The final scene of _Stone Ocean_ brings back "Roundabout" by Yes, the original end credits theme from the first season, signifying the end of the original timeline thanks to the Cosmic Retcon.
-   _The Last: Naruto the Movie_ includes a reprise version of the main theme heard in Part I of the anime. The original theme is used during the final battle.
    -   _Boruto: Naruto the Movie_ has a reprise of "Reverse Situation" for the climatic battle as well as a reprise of "Heaven-Shaking Event" for the final attack.
-   In the English dubbed version of the last episode of _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_, the original theme song (episodes 1-73) plays during the last scene.
-   _Star Driver_ uses the first ending theme for the final battle between Takuto/Tauburn and Samekh. It seems a little weird at first, since it's a girl band pop song playing over a huge fight between two Humongous Mecha in space while Earth is slowly in the process of dying, but still works.
-   _Captain Earth_ has the first opening theme, "Believer's High" by Flumpool, playing when Daichi commences the final battle.
-   _Get Backers_ uses its original opening theme "Stardust" as the ending to the 49th (final) episode. However, the North American DVD version, like _The Twelve Kingdoms_ above, added the standard closing sequence afterwards to accommodate translated credits.
-   _Tokyo Ghoul_ uses its first opening 'Unravel' during the final episode of season 1, as well as a softer version in the final episode of season 2.
-   _Little Witch Academia (2017)_ has its first opening theme, "Shiny Ray", play when Akko rescues Diana from her fall in the final episode.
-   _Lupin III: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine_ plays the finale of the penultimate episode to the instrumental version of the opening; ostensibly, to let us appreciate the opening in the next and final episode in a new light.
-   The very last scene of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha The MOVIE 1st_ (discounting the epilogue and the credits) featured a cover of the "Little Wish, Lyrical Step", the ending theme from the first season.
-   The final episode of _Fairy Tail_ has a reprise from the very first opening "Snow Fairy" when Lucy is shown getting an award for one of her novels. 'Don't say goodbye' takes on a rather heartbreaking context for longtime fans in that sense.
-   The final episode of _Ojamajo Doremi Dokka~n!_ has the theme of the first series, "Ojamajo Carnival!", play over the scene where we see the girls' lives after the events of the series.
-   _Pretty Cure_:
    -   _Maho Girls Pretty Cure!_ has the first opening play over the final scene of the last episode.
    -   _HuGtto! Pretty Cure_ omitted the opening of its final episode so it could play over its very last scene.
-   Episode 50 of _GO-GO Tamagotchi!_ (the Grand Finale of the anime television series in general) has a montage of clips from past episodes at the end featuring the theme song playing in the background one last time.
-   The final episode of _One-Punch Man_'s first season forgoes an opening sequence, instead including the show's theme as a backdrop for the climactic battle between Saitama and Boros.
-   _Major_: The first opening, "Kokoroe", is used as the ending theme for the 1st, 5th and 6th season finales in the anime. Given how the song's lyrics reflect Goro's growth from childhood to adulthood as he chases after his dreams, in every instance the song is played with a recap montage of his experiences up until that point in the series.
-   _Food Wars!_: Season 4's second-to-last episode features the first Season 1 opening, "Kibou no Uta" as an insert song during Azami's Villainous Breakdown, when Soma and Erina defeat Rindou and Eishi in the final bout of the _Regiment de Cuisine_. A piano version of the song plays during the final scene of the last episode, when Soma comes back from abroad and Erina welcomes him at his restaurant.
-   _Vandread_ uses its original opening theme "Trust" as the ending theme to the 26th (final) episode.
-   The final episode of the _Kuroko's Basketball_ anime has a reprise of its original opening theme "Can Do It" as Kagami scores the winning dunk to secure the Winter Cup championship.
-   The final episode of _Wolf's Rain_ has an opening Silent Credits to highlight how grim the situation is. The regular opening is later played as the closing theme for the final curtain call.
-   The final episode for season 3 of _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ reprises the season 1 ending theme "Sentimential Crisis" during Kaguya and Shirogane's First Kiss. While it isn't the end of the series, it does mark a major shift in the status quo.
-   _Pokémon: To Be a Pokémon Master_: the final episode ends with Type: Wild playing over the credits; the theme song most heavily associated with Ash's character in Japan, being a fitting send off for him finally being retired as the protagonist.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Austin & Ally_ ends with the now married Austin and Ally rehearsing the theme song on piano.
-   After nixing the very beloved theme tune "Overkill" in 2009, _The Bill_ brought the theme tune back to close their last ever episode.
-   _Kamen Rider_:
    -   Happens in the final two episodes of _Kamen Rider Double_, the first one being a Dark Reprise of the ending song "Cyclone Effect" as Philip and Shotaro fight together for what they believe to be the last time. The same episode had the main theme "W-B-X" play earlier during Shotaro’s solo confrontation against the Final Boss after coming to terms with succeeding his late mentor. The final epilogue episode uses the main theme to symbolize Philip and Shotaro once again reuniting to become Double.
    -   _Kamen Rider OOO_ has a slightly different approach, playing a slowed-down emotional version of the theme as Eiji, Hina, and Ankh spend one last night together before the final battle.
    -   _Kamen Rider Gaim_'s final episode is similar to _Double_'s, being an epilogue and using the theme to symbolize a broken relationship being restored. In this case, Mitsuzane is guilt-ridden over his actions over the course of the series, but when Kouta returns to help deal with a threat, Micchy gets closure by fighting alongside his friend one last time.
-   A _Super Sentai_ tradition. The theme plays in full to serenade the show out, while the ending footage is intercut with montages showing each Ranger's glory moments.
    -   _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_ has its theme song as Background Music for the final scene, in which the Gokaigers leave Earth and all the veteran Sentai teams get their powers back.
-   The Grand Finale of _Liv and Maddie_ ends with everyone singing an acoustic version of the theme song.
-   In the final scene of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_'s final episode, a careful listener can hear a slower version of the main title song in the Background Music. Considering the events of that episode overturn all the premises of the entire series, it's eerily appropriate.
    -   This trope also makes a more standard appearance, regular theme tune and all in "Prophecy Girl" when Buffy gets her second wind and goes after the Master in the season 1 finale. Not the last episode of the series, but good enough.
-   The original series finale for _Scrubs_ (the last episode of season 8) ends on a banjo instrumental of the theme song. A behind-the-scenes reel of the cast and crew saying goodbye to one another over the credits is accompanied by an a capella cover of the theme song by the in-universe cover band The Worthless Peons.
-   Used in the finale of the first season of _Dexter_, played while Dexter gives a narration and everyone cheers in his imagination.
-   _Stargate SG-1_: Used at the end of the 8th season finale, which was believed to be the series finale before it was renewed. After SG-1 defeats Ra when they travel back in time, the Egyptian slaves wave their stolen weapons around and a glorious rendition of the _Stargate_ theme plays in almost its entirety, signalling that the series had come full circle and returned to where the movie ended.
-   The main theme from _Rome_ plays over the last scene of the finale, as Pullo and Cesarion melt into the city's bustling crowds.
-   The final episode of ER played the original theme song over the beginning and the end. It really stands out as the theme song had not been used in several years.
-   The final episode of _Fraggle Rock_ ended with the Fraggles, the Doozers, the Gorgs, the Trash Heap, and Doc and Sprocket all singing the theme.
-   _The Wire_'s theme song changed every season—originally a cover of Tom Waits' "Way Down in the Hole" by the Blind Boys of Alabama, Waits' original version was used as the theme in season two, and three more covers were used for the following seasons. The series finale ended with a montage of what the most important characters were doing as the events of the series came to a close, the montage set to the Blind Boys of Alabama version of the theme song.
-   _The Wire_ inspired the closing montage of _Community_'s Series Fauxnale (last episode of season 3) and the use of the show's theme song over it.
-   _Father Ted_'s finale closed with the intro music playing over a montage of the characters' various exploits throughout the show. It was especially touching as the actor playing the title character, Dermot Morgan, had died shortly after shooting had completed, so the whole thing worked as a send-off to him.
-   The final scene in the final episode of _Star Trek: Enterprise_ did this with not just its own closing theme (aka "Archer's Theme") but also bits of the themes from _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ and _Star Trek: The Original Series_.
-   The very final minutes of the third series of _The Bridge (2011)_, as Saga and Henrik set out on their unofficial investigation of the murder of Henrik's wife, use the theme music as incidental music leading into the end credits. Notably, this includes portions of the song, "Hollow Talk" by Choir of Young Believers, that were cut from the opening and closing credits edit.
-   _Auf Wiedersehen, Pet_ had different opening and closing themes for each season, but the very last episode plays out with "Breakin' Away", the opening theme from Season 1.
-   An acoustic version of the theme song is played on the last scene of the _The Big Bang Theory_.
-   _Ultra Series_:
    -   _Ultraman Tiga_: The last episode has a slightly remixed version of "Take Me Higher", the series' opening theme song, playing as Daigo/Tiga has his Heroic Second Wind against Gatanothor in his Glitter Tiga form.
    -   _Ultraman Ginga_ has the series' second opening theme "Ginga no Uta" play in the final battle between Ultraman Ginga and Dark Lugiel.
        -   _Ultraman Ginga S_ has the opening theme "Eiyuu no Uta" play in the series finale in the battle of Ultraman Ginga and Victory against Vict Lugiel.

    Podcasts 

-   The Grand Finale of _The Adventure Zone: Amnesty_ features the track "Belligerence Limit", a kick-ass remix of the already kick-ass theme, which plays when Duck Newton figures out how to shut down Project Reconciliation once and for all.

    Video Games 

-   _Katamari Damacy's_ opening theme, "Katamari on the Rocks", later returns as the theme of the final stage, "Make the Moon".
-   _Kingdom Hearts_ and _Kingdom Hearts II_'s respective theme songs, "Hikari"/"Simple and Clean" and "Passion"/"Sanctuary", play upon the completion of each game.
    -   _Kingdom Hearts 3D \[Dream Drop Distance\]_ plays with this, though - an instrumental Hikari is the opening, and "Passion"/"Sanctuary" is the credits song.
    -   And the final results screen of each game plays a reprise of "Dearly Beloved", the opening menu screen theme.
-   _Wild ARMs 4_ has an extended version of its opening theme as last boss music.
    -   _Wild ARMs 5_ also uses the extended version of its opening theme as the music for the last boss. _Wild ARMs 2_ was the first one in the _Wild ARMs_ series to use an opening as the theme for the final battle. In its case, it used a non-vocal rock version of the first opening.
-   _The Wizard of Oz: Beyond the Yellow Brick Road_ plays a remix of it's opening theme "RIZ-ZOWAD" during the final dungeon. Appropriately enough, the game ends where it starts: on the Yellow Brick Road.
-   _Romancing StellaVisor_, a Fan Remake of _Hoshi wo Miru Hito_, plays a techno-rock remix of the title theme during the Final Boss.
-   _Final Fantasy IV_ plays "The Red Wings", the song from the opening cutscenes, during the first half of its final dungeon. The last battle theme also includes a dark variation on the World Map theme, and the "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue expands on the Underworld theme.
    -   _Final Fantasy VI_ includes the opening theme in Dancing Mad, the final battle's theme.
    -   _Final Fantasy VIII_ opens with the chorus of "Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec." The last battle against Ultimecia's One-Winged Angel form begins with a distorted voice repeating this same chorus.
    -   _Final Fantasy X_ opens with the hard rock song "Otherworld," which also serves as an Expository Theme Tune for the game. It's later heard as the theme of the Final Boss (more precisely, the Climax Boss, since the actual final boss is a Zero-Effort Boss).
    -   _Final Fantasy XV_'s final battle theme is a actionized remix of the game's main theme combined with the theme of the Big Bad, Ardyn.
-   At the end of _Chrono Trigger_, the game's main theme appears prominent during "World Revolution", the music for Lavos' second of three forms.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ plays a chilling remix of its opening theme during the battle against Dark Beast Ganon. The theme even increases in tempo and intensity the closer you get to the end of the fight.
-   _NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams_ has this trope play as a remix of the series theme, Dreams Dreams known as "Cruising Together" for the second act of the final stage, Bell Bridge, after Will saves Helen from a deadly fall. The vocals of this song are the original vocals for the Sega Saturn game's adult version.
-   Done in both the _Sonic Adventure_ games, as well as _Shadow the Hedgehog_ and _Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)_, which are _Adventure_ games in spirit. And _Sonic Colors_, which isn't.
-   All three _Super Smash Bros._ games do this, most notably the end of the Subspace Emissary in _Brawl_, with the translated lyrics.
-   A rock remix of "Goroch's/Gyorocchi's Theme" plays while facing the final boss of _Patapon 3_. There is another version of the theme called Gyorocchi Rock, but it only plays in two regular missions instead of a boss.
-   _Persona 3_ does this _twice_. The true Final Battle is set against "Battle Hymn of the Soul" / "Battle For Everyone's Souls," a Rock-Orchestra version of the _Persona_ series-wide theme "Aria of the Soul" / "The Poem For Everyone's Souls." Then the _final_ Final Battle (a scripted event) provides a heart-pounding Rap remix of "Burn My Dread," the opening theme of the game.
    -   _Persona 4_ has "The Genesis" for its final boss, which eventually plays a reprise of the boss theme "I'll Face Myself" and finishes with an orchestral remix of the game's leitmotif, "Reach Out To The Truth".
-   _Fire Emblem_
-   _Star Fox: Assault_ does this during its final boss fight with the theme heard when you turn on the game. It comes in triumphantly 43 seconds into the song. Bonus points if you can manage to break off the Aparoid Queen's dragon head and have Fox shout, "Here I come you evil space hag!"
-   _Mega Man Star Force 3_ also does this in the final story boss, Crimson Dragon. Not only this, but it's also an example of Diegetic Soundtrack Usage, because Sonia has written the song about Geo. Aww.
-   _Metroid: Zero Mission_. Once you get back your suit in Chozodia, the Brinstar Depths theme (first area) plays instead of the tense stealth music.
-   _Double Dragon Neon_ does this twice. The main theme of the game, and series as a whole, plays over the final boss battle. A lyrical version of the theme, titled "Dared to Dream", plays over the credits as the Big Bad's Villain Song.
-   In _The Second Reality Project Reloaded_, the music for the final level incorporates Distant Worlds into itself.
-   _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's Portable_:
    -   Cross medium example in the fighting game _The Battle of Aces_, which uses the non-vocal, electric guitar version of the opening from the _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's_ anime as one of two possible final boss music.
    -   In the sequel, _The Gears of Destiny_, the last phase of the Final Battle against the Unbreakable Darkness is accompanied by an arranged version of Romancers' Neo, the game's opening.
-   "Hopes and Dreams," the battle theme for the True Final Boss of _Undertale,_ is a remix of the game's opening theme, Once Upon a Time.

-   In _Call of Juarez: The Cartel_, the final shootout against your 2 teammates is set to a dramatic One-Woman Wail version of the _Call of Juarez_ title theme.

    -   The battle against Dark Purple Arfoire plays _More Soul! Continue_, the theme for the Zero Dimension Z arc.
    -   The battle against Affimojas plays _Delusion 4tune_, the theme for the Hyper Dimension G arc.
    -   The battle against Kurome does not play _Delusion Catharsis_, the opening for the Heart Dimension H arc, which is closer to an Award-Bait Song, and instead plays _The Vision Of Telativity_, which is the theme for the entire game as a whole.
-   _Metal Gear_:
    -   _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_: Five minutes into the final battle, the instrumental of "Snake Eater" plays, followed by the vocal version. And then you die.
    -   _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_ plays themes from all four _Metal Gear Solid_ games to date over the phases of its final battle, including "Snake Eater".
    -   _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_: The "Peace Walker Main Theme" plays over the last battle with Peace Walker, appropriately enough.
-   The ending theme of _Xenoblade Chronicles 2_, "One Last You", incorporates the melody of the title theme, the appropriately titled "Where We Used To Be".

-   _Haven (2020)_'s main menu theme, "The Beginning of Something", has an undoubtedly epic reprise as "Until The End of Time" during the Very Definitely Final Dungeon sequence.
-   _Bravely Default_ combines this trope with Theme Music Power-Up in its final boss theme. After the heroes receive the aid they need in order to stop Ouroboros from devouring the other worlds, and the fight draws towards the end, the music first plays a reprise of all four characters' themes, building in intensity, before launching into a triumphant final reprise of the game's main theme.
-   In _Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes_, both the final boss' theme and Silver Face's (the DLC boss) themes incorporate the series' iconic NMH Theme in a Dark Reprise.
-   In _Elden Ring_, the penultimate battle against Radagon has a reprise of the main theme playing over it.
-   In the _Touhou_ fangame _Gensou Shoujo Taisen_, the main theme, "Fantasy Maiden Wars ~ Mystic Dream" gets a Triumphant Reprise in the form of "Final Phase ~ Mystic Dream", which kicks in when the Final Boss, Makura, declares her final spell card, The Furthest Reaches of Dreams, and the protagonists respond by declaring their own spell card, Fantasy Maiden Wars.
