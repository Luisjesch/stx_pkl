**Chief:** Max, you realize you'll be facing every kind of danger imaginable.  
**Max:** And. Loving it.

A standard television plot. An assignment is received in The Teaser. A planning session is held (Avengers Assemble). Then comes The Caper or The Con, using a Master of Disguise and an A-Team Montage. The resolution is as close to end of The Tag as possible. At about the 40-minute mark, there is a Pseudo-Crisis.

The trope takes its name from the classic _Mission: Impossible_ television series, whose Impossible Mission Force did one of these every week. As such, note that not every impossible mission is an Impossible Mission.

For missions that actually _are_ impossible, see Impossible Task.

Not to be confused with the video game _Impossible Mission_. Also see Suicide Mission when the probability of dying is very high.

## Examples:

     Comic Books 

-   _Global Frequency_ is an anthology of mostly self-contained stories that used this sort of plot, although not every story follows its structure perfectly. The premise owed a certain amount of inspiration to the Trope Namer, concerning a Heroes "R" Us organisation that specialised bringing together people with very unusual and specific skills to solve particularly unusual and specific problems that required those skills.

    Fan Works 

-   The Midnight Verse story _Diamonds in the Desert_ is one long example of this.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The movie _Inception_ has this as the "inception" itself. Dom Cobb is used to steal secrets within a person's dream, implanting an idea in a person's mind is a whole different affair.
-   As with its televised source material, the _Mission: Impossible_ film series runs on this trope.
-   The _National Treasure_ movies regularly fell into this, with plots like stealing the Declaration of Independence and kidnapping the President of the United States.
-   _Paths of Glory_ combines this with Suicide Mission.
-   _The League of Gentlemen_ may be seen as an Ur-Example.
-   The heist in _Les Spécialistes_ involves Robbing the Mob Bank and has very few chances of success. The film's tagline plays this up with "It was impossible. They did it!".

    Game Shows 

-   In Series 4 of _Taskmaster_, Greg and Alex decide that Mel is _far_ too positive, and decide to give her the impossible task of hiding a _gigantic_ beach ball from Alex in only 5 minutes. It's an extra task, and she doesn't get any points for it, and it's purely in an attempt to push her to her Rage Breaking Point. It fails, and "aw heck" is just about the most they get out of her, which they note as being Mel's equivalent of an Atomic F-Bomb. They also force her to inflate the blasted thing, which took 45 minutes, _and_ to score a goal with it, which required deflating it which took an extra 25 minutes. She didn't get points for these either, and she _still_ refuses to get even the least bit angry even when she learns they were basically just messing with her for their own enjoyment.
    
    **Greg:** I'll cop to it: she is officially nice!
    

    Literature 

-   The _Grandmaster of Theft_ series is based around this.
-   As did _Modesty Blaise_
-   _Sixof Crows_ fits this to a T, with a group of teenagers breaking into and out of the most secure prison in the world.
-   _Spy Classroom_ defines these as a mission in which another group of spies already tried and failed - the enemy now knows that someone is actively after what they're guarding and will be ready for the next group to try. Such missions have a 90% failure rate, with casualties common. Dealing with them was the specialty of the defunct unit Inferno and is shaping up to be the specialty of their successor unit Lamplight.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Not surprisingly, the _Mission: Impossible_ television series featured this on a regular basis.
-   Despite its few episodes, _Firefly_ did two of these, in "Ariel" and in "Trash".
-   Similarly, this occurred regularly on _Alias_
-   Mercilessly parodied in the _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_ game "Improbable Mission," which had agents given missions involving high stakes but ordinary tasks, such as doing laundry or mowing the lawn.
-   Every mission of _Breaking In_ seems easy at first, until complications pile up into this.
-   In the South Korean television show _Dating Agency: Cyrano_, the case for Choi Darin seems to be like this, since the girl he likes hates him a lot. However, the Dating Agency guarantees a "100% success rate"...
-   Many episodes of _Dinner: Impossible_ fall into this pattern.

    Video Games 

-   In _Borderlands 2_, the task of entering the bunker where Handsome Jack is holding Angel prisoner is framed this way, with the next several story missions involving rounding up the tools and talent needed to break in.
    
    **Roland:** If it was a trap, she would at least have made it sound possible.
