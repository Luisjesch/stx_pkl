_Yeah!_

The popularity of ferrets has created a new kind of animal sidekick character, in addition to the old standbys of the loyal, dull Dog and the smart, snarky Cat.

The weasel (or ferret) is a cute, mischievous, playful mascot who nonetheless looks out mainly for himself and can be very critical of people around him. He's nowhere near as clever as he thinks he is, and swears up and down he doesn't have to be fussed over. Until he wants to be, and frankly he's not about to turn down free food or attention if it's offered. If the dog is the fighter class, and the cat is the mage, then the weasel is the thief.

Animal mascot personalities normally fall into the Cat or Dog stereotypes even if the author has tried to use a more exotic animal, like a bird or mouse — it'll still act like a Cat or a Dog. The Weasel Mascot personality, likewise, may apply to other mustelids — but weasels, otters, and ferrets are most common. The Weasel personality is rarely applied to badgers and wolverines however (the latter in case where Bears Are Bad News). Mongooses, despite being unrelated to weasels (they're actually closer to _cats_, of all things), are also prone to this sort of portrayal.

A major benefit of the Weasel personality is that it largely reflects the behavior of the real animal. The Weasel can make a good ironic deadpan snarker, without the nasty or untrustworthy streak commonly associated with the Cat, or the aggressive, scavenging nature of the Dog. There is _deep_ irony in the contrast between the two because weasels fared differently in older Western works, although this trope's ancestor can trace back to the weasels' fictional enmity against mythical Basilisks in European legends.

Many magical animal guardians are Weasel mascots, and most Weasel mascots are Talking Animals.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Uzume the ferret in _Ai Yori Aoshi_.
-   Kero-chan in _Cardcaptor Sakura_, although he's actually a lion cub.
-   Yuuno, from _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_ is another actual ferret. He's an exception to the character type, though—he's a bookish, shy mage that gets nervous and blushes around Nanoha. This is mostly because Yuuno is not actually a ferret, but a 9-or-10-year-old human boy who transforms into such; when this is finally revealed, Nanoha reacts predictably.
-   Japolo from _Shamanic Princess_ is a Talking Animal Battle Butler and would-be Mentor Mascot. He fancies himself full of important information and sage advice, but in reality his main contribution is snark and Plucky Comic Relief.
-   Hisashi Sakisaka, an occasional recurring character in the _Midori Days_ manga, has a weasel sidekick, Tomahawk, on his shoulder at all times.
-   Although the series is realistic, and he is an actual ferret, the anime _Strawberry Marshmallow_ has John, who belongs to the unbelievably-adorable Matsuri. John is cute, mischievous and playful, but that seems the extent of his Weasel Mascot traits.
-   Mepple in _Futari wa Pretty Cure_ has an incredible attitude, and is greedy, picky, and likes to guilt Nagisa into doing things for him.
-   Tart from _Fresh Pretty Cure!_, who insist that he's a 'cute fairy' and speaks with Kansai accent. He swings around being responsible (trying to help the Cures) and irresponsible (stealing the Cures' foods like ice cream) at times.
-   Used in _Spirited Away_, not that you'd be able to tell: the "Art of" book tells us that the character Lin is supposed to be a transformed weasel. She's sarcastic but sweet and quite cute.
-   Chamo from _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ (with Dirty Old Man tendencies to boot!).
    -   He would like to remind you he's an ermine, thank you very much.
    -   There is a specific punishment for mages in _Mahou Sensei Negima_: temporary transformation into an ermine. It is never stated directly, but some lines may imply that Chamo-kun did undergo such a penalty. Nevertheless, Chamo-kun always claims he is a regular ermine and mentions about his ermine family. He also revealed that he was banned from his home country for stealing panties from his girl ermine companions. This may be somewhat true.
    -   In the manga, he's pretty specific at several points in explaining he's an ermine sprite, which is where most of his powers — such as forming pactios and being able to read peoples' emotions — come from. He fled to Japan to find Negi to get him to hire him as a familiar so he wouldn't be punished for his panty theft.

-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   Ash's (previously Dawn's) Buizel is one of these despite the actual mascots being the Rodent of Unusual Size and the adorable yet overused Penguin. It initially followed in the tracks of previous badasses Charizard and Sceptile, and did a very good job of it early on despite being a Ridiculously Cute Critter. Unfortunately, it hit a losing streak later on.
    -   In its first appearance, Buizel was the mascot of the traveling troupe in _Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea_ and was the most prominent Pokémon until Manaphy appeared.
    -   Oshawott is the new mustelid on the team in _Black and White_.
-   Okojo-San from the titular manga and the anime _Siawase Apartment_'s Okojo-san is an ermine. He can't talk to people, but he can to the other animals in the apartment complex.
-   _Bleach_: While technically not a weasel, Kon sure has the personality for it.
-   In the manga adaptation of _Super Dimension Fortress Macross_, Minmay has one of these, a bizarre rabbit/weasel hybrid that probably doesn't exist in nature.
-   _Naruto_: During her Big Damn Heroes moment, Temari uses her fan to summon an eyepatch-wearing, scythe-wielding weasel named Kamatari that brings with it a massive swath of destruction against Tayuya. Which to anyone who knows Japanese is a pun on the word "Kamaitachi", which means "slicing wind", but "Kama" and "Itachi" means "sickle" and "weasel" respectively.
-   Einstein the ferret in _Alien from the Darkness_, whose main hobbies appear to be searching for fish and molesting its female owner. It's also an Evil Detecting Ferret, able to sence when someone is possessed by the evil alien.
-   Candy from _Candy Candy_ has a pet raccoon called Clean.
-   Kyubey from _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ is a cute ferret- or fox-like creature, but given the nature of the show it's a subversion. There's a good reason that a good chunk of the show's fans don't trust him at all. Wicked Weasel, after all<small>◊</small>. He seems to be less of a subversion by the end of the show.
    -   Zig-Zagged going into _Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie: Rebellion_. Turns out he never stopped being the evil git he is, and if anything his "amending" conversation with Homura only gave him the idea to exploit her to bring back the old witch system.
-   _Tenchi Muyo!_: Ryo-Ohki is Ryoko's pet that meows like a cat, yet eats carrots like a rabbit.
-   Nils from the animated adaptation of _The Wonderful Adventures of Nils_ has a hamster sidekick called Krumel who usually provides the voice of reason.

    Comic Books 

-   Seamus the pooka from _Blue Monday_.
-   Spip, _Spirou & Fantasio_'s snarky squirrel.
-   Played with in _Get Fuzzy_ with Bucky's silent ferret nemesis, Fungo Squiggly.
-   _Peach Fuzz_, where the ferrets are the main characters... at least, _they_ think they are. Their owners think they're just cute pets.

    Fan Works 

-   In reference to his Forced Transformation in _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_, some fan fiction makes Draco Malfoy a ferret animagus.
-   _Guardians of Pokémon_ has a pair of these, Jupei and Ki. This is not surprising as the author has stated that the fic was inspired by three anime: _Pokémon: The Series_ (of course), _Sailor Moon_, and _Cardcaptor Sakura_.

    Films — Animated 

-   Wilma, a singing Genki Girl weasel from _The Flight Before Christmas_.

-   _Harry Potter_ has Jarveys, smart-talking (very large) magical mustelids.
    -   Mr. Weasley's Patronus is a weasel, while Hermione's is an otter. (No wonder she married into the family.)
        -   The entire Weasley family have a strong mustelid motif going on, starting with their last name. They live in a home they call The Burrow, near _Stoats_head Hill and the village of _Otter_y St. Catchpole (which sounds a little bit like "polecat").
-   John Wesley Weasel from _The Book of the Dun Cow_is an Anti-Hero example; although fierce, stubborn and implied to be a Reformed Criminal, is extremely loyal to the rooster protagonist, is undoubtedly one of the good guys, and literally kills thousands of enemy mythical Basilisks single-handedly after one murders his Nice Mice friend.
-   _The Areas of My Expertise_: "Let's use my ferret to steal that diamond."
    -   _More Information Than You Require_: "New ferret, same old con."
    -   Taken to its logical conclusion with a mounted ferret skeleton on the back cover of the Darker and Edgier finale, _That is All_.
-   Ozzie from _Avalon: Web of Magic_ is an elf who was magically transformed into a ferret. Besides being more goofy than snarky, he's pretty much this trope exactly.
-   The title character of _Zucchini_ is a boy's pet ferret. The book was later adapted on _CBS Storybreak_.
-   In _Spellbent_, Jessie Shimmer's magical familiar is a Deadpan Snarker ferret named Palimpsest.

-   In Stephen King's _The Dark Tower_ books, the heroes are accompanied by Oy, a creature called a Billy-Bumbler which is said to resemble a cross between a raccoon, a badger, and a dog (although illustrations often make him look like a civet<small>◊</small>). While intensely loyal to Roland and Jake, he otherwise has the snarky, independent attitude common to this trope.
-   The main heroes in _Welkin Weasels_ are, as Exactly What It Says on the Tin, weasels. Stoats on other hand are their arch enemies.

-   The announcer on _Late Night Liars_ is a weasel.
-   In _Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide_ an actual weasel supposedly infests Polk Middle School (whose _official_ mascot is a wolf), and is the bane of the janitor's existence. It turns out to be pregnant and looking for a nest; it and its young are then adopted as second mascots by the moved janitor.
    -   The weasel ends up elected as the class president, over several more-qualified human candidates. (Actually, "more-qualified" is debatable...)
-   _The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson_: "Do we have a picture<small>◊</small> of me with my ferrets?"

-   _Torchlight_ launched with the choice of a dog or a cat as the character's animal partner, but a later official mod added a ferret as a third option. It has also been officially added as a pet choice in _Torchlight II_.
-   Kiki was Alpha Creations Softworks' mascot during the '80s.

-   Arco from _Arietta Of Spirits_, who even gets called a "flying weasel" by one of the human spirit characters.

    Webcomics 

-   Kiki from _Sluggy Freelance_. Although her Genki Girl attitude may make her a subversion.
-   Wendy Weasel from _Cwen's Quest_ plays straight (wo)man/big sister to titular character Cwen and keeps Cwen humble.
-   Menjou from _Candi_ — who adds the "embellished" to the comic's Life Embellished nature due to being telepathic, telekinetic and at war with the local Squirrel Mafia. His "girlfriend", Snowflake the albino squirrel, is his Distaff Counterpart (swapping psi powers for Eye Beams).

-   Annie from _Demon Of The Underground_. She was found in Pogo's pants and took on a group of mooks while he was busy.
-   _Girl Genius_:
    -   The Wulfenbach Bug Squad (more officially known as the Vespiary Squad) use heavily modified weasels to hunt down and destroy slaver wasps, the most dangerous of this world's **many** abominations of science. Although they have eight legs, they _are_ still, very much, weasels of some description. And, they are sooo cute (for a given definition of cute).
    -   Agatha herself acquired one after Tarvek rescued several from a crashed Vespiary Squad airship. After the Time Skip, Agatha keeps it close at all times because Tweedle modified her so that she literally can't live without him. Agatha modified the weasel to fill Tweedle's role.
-   Tragia from _The Secret Lives Of Flowers_. Being the main character, he defaults as this.

    Web Video 

-   _Critical Role_: Jester buys a red weasel from an animal salesman once and calls him Sprinkle. While the other animals the Mighty Nein bought at that occasion are quickly left behind, Sprinkle stays with them. He is frequently forgotten and thus nearly drowns on several occasions or gets caught in the blast of area spells. Turns out, he's actually Artagan, an immortal archfey and Jester's Warlock patron, who took the weasel form to be close to her..
-   On the _Dream SMP_ and the _Pirates SMP_, Eret's stream chat manifests as a large business of ferrets that follows them around. Their personalities depend on the individual chatter, but usually range anywhere from enthusiastic to snarky.
-   Kishido Temma of Holostars has a pet ferret named Hiyamaru that often sits on his shoulder.

    Western Animation 

-   Rufus from _Kim Possible_, though actually a naked mole rat.
-   Pabu from _The Legend of Korra_ (a sequel to _Avatar_) is a fire ferret — a combination of a ferret and a red panda. Yes, it's as adorable as it sounds. He is also the In-Universe mascot for the protagonists' pro-bending team, the Fire Ferrets.
-   _The Animals of Farthing Wood_ features the character Weasel, who is actually a rather sarcastic, selfish Deadpan Snarker.

    Real Life 

-   Ferrets do indeed tend to have very hyperactive and playful personalities in real life, with a special emphasis on _hyperactive_, which is something to keep in mind for households with small children; they're either asleep or bouncing off the walls, and what between playful ferrets would be an inconsequential nip might easily break a child's skin.
    -   They also like to chew on things, so by all means don't leave your leather goods within their reach. Or your keys. Or socks. Or shoes, potatoes, beer bottles, napkins, things made out of rubber, anything spherical, anything shiny (_especially_ anything shiny), anything that tastes good (and you'd be amazed what a ferret thinks tastes good, especially dangerous since consuming anything other than meat is likely to damage their pancreases), anything that bounces or makes an interesting noise, anything that'll fit under a couch, anything you'd be upset to lose for several months and then rediscover decorated with tiny toothmarks...compared with the effort that goes into defending one's chattels from marauding mustelids, child-proofing a house is dirt-simple.
-   Oh, and they're called "mustelid" for a reason; that word shares a root with "musk", and indeed they do have an odor, which some find pleasant and others find intolerable. And they tend to nip, and even the best of them defecate in corners, and most of the ones you find in the United States are severely inbred and thus prone to dying badly of cancer after six or seven years. In general, they're adorable little monsters if you've got the personality to put up with them, but they're definitely not for everyone.
-   US Military radar jamming insignia often feature a weasel mascot.
    -   The US Air Force uses the term "Wild Weasel" to refer to air strike tactics aimed at destroying enemy radar installations, thus blinding their Anti-Air, first during The Vietnam War and then during The Gulf War. Since this was based on detecting and then firing homing missiles at radar sites, it meant the attacking aircraft (or others flying decoy) had to attract attention to themselves. The unofficial slogan of Wild Weasel units, YGBSM, was coined when an Electronic Warfare Officer responded to a mission briefing with "You gotta be shitting me!"
