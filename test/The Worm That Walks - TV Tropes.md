**Buffy:** You and bug people, Xander. What's up with that?  
**Xander:** No, but this dude was completely different than praying mantis lady. He was a man _of_ bugs, not a man who _was_ a bug.

Sometimes, when you want a really scary monster, a giant insect just won't do. They've been done to death and look really cheesy to boot. But you still want a bug monster — what do you do?

Well, you call this guy. He isn't just _one_ bug — he's _millions!_ Millions of tiny creepy crawlies make up his body, as if his entire body is composed of Synchronized Swarming controlled by a Hive Mind. Sometimes it's worms, sometimes it's insects — bees are always good — and sometimes it's just any creepy thing you can think of.

Villains like this aren't always the most lethal but are often very hard to hurt. Trying to punch one is like trying to punch water (only far more disgusting). In some cases, they are almost impossible to kill, because if even _one_ of the creatures that makes up its body survives, there is the possibility that it will return (though it may take a while). Kill It with Fire is often your best bet.

In real life, these are called colony organisms or superorganisms.

Could be considered an extreme of the Totem Pole Trench. At times the members can retain their individuality and are just really well-coordinated. This trope is almost always combined with Healing Factor or even From a Single Maggot. Just don't confuse him with The Worm Guy, or Earthworm Jim, or the Ghost Who Walks. One to Million to One is a variant where a creature can become The Swarm, but it isn't its common form. See also Combining Mecha for the mechanical counterpart of this trope, and Body of Bodies for the vertebrate one. One justification for a Pest Controller.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Berserk_: The Godhand do not have bodies that exist in the material realm, so when they want to affect things, they need to take preexisting materials to make bodies from. Slan once made a body from troll guts, and Conrad made one from a mass of rats.
-   _Delicious in Dungeon_: For the longest time, it was an accepted fact that Living Armor was ordinary suits of armor that had been enchanted to move, but then Laios noticed an egg sac on the shield of the 'leader' of a group of them. After bringing the leader down and inspecting it closer, he learned the truth: Living Armors are colonial organisms made up of metallic-shelled mollusks all linked together in a humanoid shape. Much to his delight, they can, in fact, be eaten.
-   Gambon's mooks in _Fist of the North Star_ have a specialty called the Centipede Fighting whereby they hop on each other's shoulder to form, well, centipedes.
-   Done in the most Squicktacular way possible in _Fort of Apocalypse_. When the four juvenile delinquents escape from the frenzied prison into the zombie-filled streets of the city, they discover to their horror that the mountain in the middle of the street is actually a towering mound made of the rotting corpses of the undead, with a stark-naked figure sitting on the very top like a macabre throne. Then the mound starts moving.
-   In chapter 24 of _Franken Fran_, the Wandering Jew shows up. Despite being immortal, his original body except for his skeletal structure has long since rotted away. His curse of immortality solved the problem by _constantly summoning insects to replace his body_. He's essentially an undying skeleton with bugs for muscles and organs. Amazingly enough, this chapter actually has a happy ending for the poor guy.
-   Dokubachi in _Get Backers_ is the Bee that Walks (and flies and philosophizes and uses ki attacks...) whose body is a bizarre, super-specialized honeycomb that gives him all manner of bee-related abilities. Unusually for this trope, though, his final form looks completely human.
-   The "Carriers" from _Infection_ are basically colonies of maggots nesting within corpses of their victims, multiplying in such numbers that they burst out whenever the corpse opens its mouth. The problem only gets worse when they start growing in _size_ as well.
-   Naraku from _Inuyasha_ is composed of a giant, writhing mass of youkai, most of which are a mixture of snakelike, bug-like, and slimy in nature.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   F.F. from _Jo Jos Bizarre Adventure Stone Ocean_ is a mass of plankton that gained sapience and Stand powers, later taking up residence inside the corpse of a young woman so that she can join the heroes.
    -   Mrs. Robinson from _Jo Jos Bizarre Adventure Steel Ball Run_ (a _man_ with a Gender-Blender Name) was supposedly killed by men and hung out on a cactus only to revive. He uses his body to store various insects which he can control. What is _really_ creepy is that his power doesn't stem from a Stand — almost as if it's entirely fueled by some kind of, er, Nightmare Fuel.
-   In _King of Thorn_, the Medusa manifestation of Peter Stevens's psyche takes on this form.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Shino Aburame and the rest of the Aburame clan are not _made_ of bugs, but house swarms of energy-draining beetles in their bodies since shortly after their birth, perhaps even more disturbing than simply being composed of the insects — in short, they are basically human hives. A "Bug Clone" technique also exists, in which the user creates a clone of himself out of those beetles, truer to this trope.
    -   Orochimaru's _true_ true form (yeah, he seems to have a lot of those) is that he's made of snakes, while being a giant snake himself. What do the snakes look like? Well, they certainly don't do anything to take away his reputation as a creepy boy watcher. Even before that was revealed, it was evident he was made of snakes when he got cut in half and had them spring out of his halves to pull them together.
    -   Tsunade's Summon, Katsuyu the Slug, can dissolve into many smaller slugs, each of which talks and behaves like the original.

-   In _Tales of Wedding Rings_, the party encounters a Giant Spider which is really a colony of countless tiny, silverfish-like monsters that have joined together to form a single entity. Cutting off its limbs is nearly pointless, since the severed appendages will break apart into their component critters and swarm back into the main body, letting it regenerate.
-   Tommyrod from _Toriko_ gives off this vibe but is actually an aversion, as he is not literally _made_ of insects. He just stores eggs in his esophagus and vomits the newly hatched bugs at the enemy. This is somehow even more disturbing than the alternative.
-   Zazie the Beast from _Trigun_. In a metaphysical sense, yes, Zazie is "the worm who walks", but both of its bodies are perfectly normal humans. Zazie's _mind_ is made of insects — it's the current interactive hub for a Hive Mind of the native Sand Worms.
-   _The☆Ultraman_: Zamiba's default form is a mass of cave-dwelling critters which attack via Zerg Rush on victims. However, when push comes to shove, they will merge together into a massive Kaiju, which they do at the end of the episode to battle Ultraman Joneus.

    Card Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_ has Mindleech Mass from the _Ravnica: City of Guilds_ expansion. It's hard to see the individual leeches at card size, but when you look closer...

    Comic Books 

-   The _Birds of Prey_ foe Entity is a nanobot swarm that consumes an industrial spy and maintains his basic humanoid shape.
-   _Bone_: The Hooded One turns out to be a woman who was cut in half, then had her body put back and held together by the Lord of the Locust's insects.
-   The Swell's combined form in the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ Season Eight issue "Swell" (made up of all the individual Vampy Cat Play Friends).
-   In _Countdown: Arena_, there's an Alternate Universe version of Blue Beetle called the Scarab, who is a vaguely humanoid mass of blue scarabs. It eats its opponents, sometimes from the inside. Oddly for such a Nightmare Fuel creature, it's supposed to come from the Funny Animal world of Earth-26.
-   _Daniel X: Alien Hunter_: Played straight with Number 7, a human-alien being made up of a colony of ants. Not only was he partially responsible for the deaths of reality warper hero, Daniel X's, family, he also is the grandmaster of an interplanetary game where alien hunters kill innocent aliens for sport, resulting in the extinction of a peaceful, furry species whose culture is based on color. The utter subversion comes from Kilgore, who happens to be Number 7's "son". Much to his "father's" chagrin, Kilgore is a sweet, loving, trusting, and very geeky alien who becomes fast friends with Daniel X. When he "dies" by being reabsorbed back into his father, this unleashes Daniel X's berserk button, and he kills Number 7 by releasing a potion that disrupts the pheremone bonds the ants use to communicate in his body.
-   _Clone Wars Adventures_: Kit Fisto comes across one such organism in _Fierce Currents._ The Moappa seem like harmless little critters living on the Mon Calamari seabed at first, but can combine into a being capable of matching wits with a Jedi master. The best Fisto can do is disperse them with the Force for a few hours, while advising the Calamari to start getting along with both the Quarren and the Moappa.
-   This was the first enemy of Vicki Montesi and the rest of the _Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins_.
-   The first storyline of the Marvel comic spinoff series _Force Works_ had the alien Scatter as the enemy. The Scatter resemble armored humanoids, but as US Agent discovers, they're actually a swarm of sapient insects controlling the armor. It gets worse when he describes how he found this out, he was watching the Scatter climb out of the armor and eat the nearby civilians alive!
-   Shinomura from the _Godzilla (2014)_ tie-in comic _Godzilla: Awakening_ consists of a mass of much smaller, single-celled organisms.
-   In _The Goon_, chugheads are small Undead Child\-type monsters who can combine together into huge amorphous horrors. This is key to the resurrection of Labrazio, one of the villains, who appears more-or-less human but whose dead soul has actually been transferred into a pile of chugheads.
-   In one of his earlier adventures, John Constantine, _Hellblazer_ fights the hunger demon, Mnemoth, who manifests as a swarm of flies forming the shape of a giant fly. A similar creature, shaped like a man, appeared in The Movie, but was not identified by name.
-   Murder in _Hoax Hunters_ is something like this. He was an astronaut whose consciousness was split among a murder of crows when he died; the crows now share a hive mind and inhabit a space suit.
-   _Immortal Iron Fist_: The character "The Bride of Nine Spiders", who, when she lifts up her stripperiffic outfit, reveals a mass of rotted, webbed flesh swarming with spiders that she can use to Zerg Rush her enemies. She's an unusual Dark Is Not Evil example of this, as she's a neutral-to-good Perky Goth. Still not somebody to upset, though.
-   In _The Savage Dragon_ comic, one of the supervillains is Horde, a body possessed by worms. It's later revealed that this is the wizard Fon~Ti (who granted Mighty Man his powers) who was taken over by one of Mighty Man's enemies, the Wicked Worm.
-   She-Hulk also fought a similar villain, Cockroaches!
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   The one-shot villain The Thousand was an entitled school bully who discovered Spider-Man's true identity and tracked down and ate the corpse of the spider that gave Spider-Man his powers to try to gain the same powers, but ended up becoming a swarm of spider in a suit of skin. He wanted to devour Spider-Man and wear his skin to get his powers because he was convinced he deserved them more.
    -   So was Ms. Arrow, "The Other".
    -   And The Swarm, a Nazi scientist made of bees. Marvel loves their worms that walk.
        -   Averted with Swarm's counterpart from an unnumbered Noir Earth, Madame Swarm, who is a mutated bee-woman who can telepathically command other bees, although she does like to surround herself in a bee swarm molded to form a larger body.
        -   In a 2020 storyline in _Ant-Man_, Swarm gained three rivals, created by a mutated insect named Macrothrax, who forced Swarm to rebuild the device that originally turned him into a sapient bee-swarm to grant the power to assume humanoid form to three Hive Minded insect swarms it had created. Thus was born Vespa ("The Specter of Hornets"), Thread ("The Silkworm Ghoul") and Tusk ("The Rhino Beetle Hulk"). In what Ant-Man notes is incredible irony, these three entities look down on Swarm and regard him as impure, due to his consciousness being a transplanted human mind, rather than one crafted "organically" from the swarm itself.
    -   Spider-Gwen plays with this, as while she definitely _isn't_ this, her symbiote presenting itself as a colony of spiders whenever she changes in-and-out of costumes makes people who meet her _assume_ this to be the case until she explains.
    -   On Earth-11580, the local Spider-Man is named Spider**s**\-Man, resulting from Peter Parker falling into a huge colony of radioactive spiders instead of being bitten by just one; he was seemingly devoured by them, but actually his consciousness (or possibly just his memories — it thinks the former, most people who talk to it suspect the latter) was assimilated by them and they became a Hive Mind continuation of him. It frequently talks about eating people ...And That Would Be Wrong.
-   The Shredder was killed in the first issue of _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage)_. Every subsequent appearance is actually a colony of worms that were scientifically and magically conditioned to take on the mind and physical form of whoever they ate.
-   The Purple Ants in Jon Lewis's _True Swamp_ kill a man and use his skeleton as a framework to become one of these.
-   _Vampirella_: A recurring trend in the Dynamite series:
    -   The giant worm god Yad-Ath Yermellus manifested itself as a swarm composed of thousands of worms during a Battle in the Center of the Mind.
    -   The resurrected Von Kreist appears as a giant made of human _skeletons_ in another mind sequence.
    -   The demon Botis appears before a Vatican strike team in the physical world made up of hundreds of dead rats.
-   The second _X-Force_ once met a "spectre of death" who looked like a giant monster made up of worms and maggots, with some skulls and bones thrown in as well.
-   _Zombo_: Zombo at one point has to go up against "ZomBee", who is a giant mass of flesh-eating bees in the shape of a zombie.

    Fan Works 

-   _Dæmorphing_: Kelbrid are hive-minds of thousands of bioluminescent worms.
-   _Sharing the Nation_: Fluttershy post-ascension straddles the line between this, magical possession, and a form of Animorphism. Most of the time, she retains her regular pre-ascension body, but she also mentally inhabits all animals within a considerable range of herself and can burst apart into a swarm of smaller critters when injured or pressed, which can afterwards reassemble into her usual body.

    Films — Animation 

-   A heroic variation in _Batman Ninja_, first with a bunch of monkeys in golden armor making a giant monkey to face off a mech, and then _that_ fuses with a large legion of bats to form a giant Batman (with said monkeys forming the belt). Because why not?
-   In _Coraline_, the Other Bobinsky in his second appearance consists of nothing more than rats that have infested his old clothing.
-   One of the pink elephants from the "Pink Elephants on Parade" sequence in _Dumbo_ is made up of multiple elephant heads piled up to form limbs and a torso, with three heads on top.
-   _The Nightmare Before Christmas_: Oogie Boogie, the only inhabitant of Halloweentown who, though comedic, is outright evil instead of just playfully scary, is made of sackcloth sewn together over thousands of insects, spiders, scorpions, and a snake.
    
    **Oogie Boogie:** My bugs! My bugs! My bugs...
    
-   In _The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature_, a bunch of mice get inside a Hazmat Suit and walk around posing as a human.
-   In _Princess Mononoke_, a demon in the beginning appears as a giant, moving mass of worms. You don't want to touch it. Technically, all demons are forest gods corrupted and covered with the snake/worm things. May still apply though, since the things _almost_ seem to compose the body of the demons.
-   In _Ralph Breaks the Internet_, the Ralph clones created by Arthur join up to become one giant Ralph which performs a "King Kong" Climb.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The Syfy film _The Bone Snatcher_ has a swarm of demonic ants that achieve a rudimentary humanoid form using the bones of people they've eaten.
-   _Candyman_: When the Candyman opens his coat, he's revealed to be little more than a skeleton wreathed in the many thousands of bees that killed him.
    -   In _Candyman (2021)_, this becomes a thematic point. There's a mild Adaptational Backstory Change for Candyman, making him no longer a single ghost but a composite of several ghosts of black men who fell victim to white racist violence and especially Police Brutality, which the swarming bees now represent.
        
        _"Candyman ain't a he. Candyman's the whole damn hive."_
        
-   In _Constantine (2005)_, the title character is attacked by a demon made entirely out of various bugs (and at least one crab). Even its face, with nose and mouth and eyes. In a bit of hilarity, it's killed by being run over and splattered all over a car. Let's hope that driver has good wind-shield wipers.
-   _Critters 2: The Main Course_ has the ever-hungry alien pests gang up into a huge mouth-covered ball that rolls over a victim and leaves a stripped skeleton behind.
-   Chitti from _Endhiran_ starts out as your standard Terminator robot with Matrix effects, then he makes magnetized copies and becomes a macro-nanobot snake made of guys, taking the forms of a sphere, a cobra, and a giant, among others.
-   The Ra'azac in the movie version of _Eragon_ are composed of a variety of vermin and one eyeball.
-   In _Fright Night Part 2_, the undead... thing... Bozworth spends most of the film catching, identifying and then ingesting insects. When finally killed, he bursts open to reveal he's pretty much skin, skeleton, and lots of squirming little bugs.
-   Destroyah from _Godzilla vs. Destoroyah_ is a truly massive example, although as its component creatures are microbes, it appears solid to the naked eye.
-   Inverted in _The Human Centipede_. There, you have a large borderline insectoid made up of three humans.
-   A character in the film _Prince of Darkness_ delivers an unpleasant message to the protagonists before falling apart and collapsing into a heap of large black beetles.
-   In _Rats: Night of Terror_, Taurus gets infested with rats and becomes an example of this trope as a method the rats use to trick the gang.
-   Reedman from _Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen_ actually transforms from thousands of tiny sphere-like Decepticons (described by TFWiki.net as "Bakugan balls") puked up by Ravage.

    Literature 

-   _Animorphs_:
    -   The Nesk are ants that form themselves into larger bodies, as per this trope. Given that the same book includes a Historical In-Joke about broccoli being introduced from an alien world, it's entirely possible that normal ants on planet Earth are the descendants of the alien Nesk. This is, in fact, Word of God. Kinda puts the fact that ants were the morph that terrified the protagonists more than any others in a new light, eh?
    -   Also the Valeek in the first _Megamorphs_ book was a tornado made out of alien bugs.
-   Sort of in _The Book of Lost Things_. When the Crooked Man tears himself apart, bugs and worms fall out.
-   _Carnival in a Fix_: Late in the book, when the gang are faced with Rustlers in the old maintenance tunnels all under the park, Mr. O'Hare tries to intimidate them with a loud roar. It doesn't work, and in response, they come together to form an identical copy of him (made up of Rustlers) and roar right back. When the group turns tail and runs, they try to follow, but have to form their body into a snake to fit through the exit that they took.
-   The Vermiform in Steph Swainston's _Castle Circle_ series is one of these.
-   In Neil Gaiman's _Coraline_, Mr. Bobo is a trainer of mice. In the Other Mother's world, The Other Bobo is a being made of rats. In The Film of the Book, the Other Bobinsky (as he has been renamed) ends up turning into this as Glamour Failure sets in:
    
    **Coraline:** You're just a copy she made of the real Mr. B.  
    **The Other Bobinsky:** Not even that, anymore.
    
-   _Discworld_:
    -   In _A Hat Full of Sky_, young witch Tiffany dances with a human-shaped swarm of bees. This swarm is perfectly benign though, and it is considered a promising sign that Tiffany, unlike most people, isn't afraid of them.
    -   Borrowing a swarm of bees is something Granny Weatherwax does in _Lords and Ladies_.
    -   A minor version of this occurs in the character of Hex in the Unseen University: A "computer" controlled by the ant colony living inside it. A similar type of machine can be seen in the Glooper in _Making Money_, although that one is controlled by water and tides and the economy.
-   In _Doc Sidhe_, Duncan Blackletter's construct Adonis turns out to be composed (and animated) by a bunch of worms over an oversized humanoid skeleton.
-   _Dream Park_: In _The Barsoom Project_, the sins of humanity make an appearance in the Fimbulwinter Game as a swarm of monstrous insect-like vermin, which assemble themselves into four giant humanoid figures to put Humanity on Trial.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   In _Skin Game_ we see Tessa can assume this form, and she uses it to great effect in one of the most horrific scenes in the series.
    -   _Side Jobs_: In the short story _Restoration of Hope_, a troll is sliced open to reveal hundreds of smaller trolls inside a troll-suit.
-   The needle monsters (and people) in _Eden Green_.
-   One of the heroes of the grail in Eric Nylund's _A Game of Universe_ is a colony of insects which walks around in humanoid form, relatively.
-   _The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon_: The priest of the God of the Lost is composed of innumerable wasps endlessly crawling over a yellowing, decayed human skeleton. The God of the Lost itself is also one of these, taking the form of a black bear whose innards are mostly comprised of wasps.
-   The Villain Protagonist team in _The Goblin Corps_ by Ari Marmell has repeated dealings with worm monsters that infest and consume anyone they come in contact with, and take humanoid forms to attack when they aren't a raw swarm. Eventually it's revealed that when Morthul took over his kingdom, he turned the old king into this out of spite. The worms have been multiplying for centuries, underground and unnoticed, and they still _hate_ Morthul for what he did to them.
-   In _The Green Brain_ by Frank Herbert, humanity has reduced nature to just a few zones in the Brazilian rainforest. Nature fights back by evolving a race of bugs that can, in large quantities, imitate human beings. The story opens with one such Worm That Walks managing to con its way past the border guards so that it can enter and attempt to infest a clean zone.
-   _He Who Fights With Monsters_: Colin is a swarm of blood-sucking leeches that Jason can summon. "His" upgraded Bronze-rank form is much different than his previous Iron-rank form. Instead of a rolling pile of leeches, he shapes himself into a roughly humanoid shape, complete with a "cloak" of bloody rags.
-   _Inside Straight_, the latest novel in the _Wild Cards_ series, features a rare heroic version of this trope, one Jonathan Hive. He appears utterly human until he disperses into a cloud of bright green wasplike motes; he can also detach as few as one at a time, and even tends to have a few wandering about misplaced.
-   Inverted in Clive Barker's _In the Hills, the Cities_, in which tremendous walking figures are constructed out of _people_. To put this in perspective, the constructed being's "teeth" are made from children's shaved heads.
-   The assassin at the end of Iain M Banks _Look to Windward_ is a swarm of nanotech bugs.
-   H. P. Lovecraft:
    -   One common interpretation of the ending of _The Festival_, though it could just as easily refer to a single huge maggot.
        
        _Wisely did Ibn Schacabac say, that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain, and happy the town at night whose wizards are all ashes. For it is of old rumour that the soul of the devil-bought hastes not from his charnel clay, but fats and instructs the very worm that gnaws; till out of corruption horrid life springs, and the dull scavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it. Great holes secretly are digged where earth's pores ought to suffice, and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl._
        
    -   In _The Dunwich Horror_, the invisible monster, while made visible for enough time to make a hapless witness go mad with fear, is made up entirely from either worms, or, as the character puts it, "squirmin' ropes" or "sep'rit wrigglin' ropes pushed clost together", all of slime or jelly.
-   An assassination attempt in _Mordant's Need_ by Stephen Donaldson features human skins full-to-bursting with cockroach-like insects that puppet the skins and then break out of their husks in order to devour their new victims.
-   In _The Mote in God's Eye_, a bunch of "Watchmaker" Moties packed inside a spacesuit manage to briefly pass for human, with the help of a severed head.
-   In _The Nekropolis Archives_, Molog, the Demon Lord of Insects, has a body made out of millions of insects. The Watchers also tend to manifest in the form of insects, and gather together swarms of these component insects when they wish to assume larger forms.
-   Ygramul the Many of _The Neverending Story_ by Michael Ende, is a gestalt collective of toxic flying blue beetle-like insects that clump together in whatever arrangement suits their purpose best, from a giant spider-thing to a massive disembodied hand. Her deadly poison grants the dying victim the ability to teleport.
-   _The Occupation Saga_: The Roaches get their nickname from their insectile exoskeletons, which are really just machines they use to move about. They're actually colonies of amoeba-like organisms.
-   _The Outsider (2018)_: the titular Outsider is strongly implied to be this. Mysterious red 'worms' come out of its head after Holly bludgeons him.
-   The flying nanobot swarms in the Michael Crichton novel _Prey_ act like a computerized version of these — they even eat carrion, as per standard maggot behavior. As their intelligence develops through the course of the book, they learn to mimic human shapes, colors, and eventually _speech_. Turns into full body horror, when the main character discovers that the swarm has enveloped and taken over his wife. However, using an electro-magnet, the swarm dispels from the body, revealing his real wife (now a shriveled skeleton) who is still alive. She is able to relay her last words before the device breaks and the nanobots overtake her body again.
-   _Railhead_ has the Hive Monks, small cockroach-like insects that gather into swarms around a human-shaped framework and don a robe and mask to conceal this. They're generally benevolent, just a bit creepy.
-   The _Ravnica Cycle_ of _Magic: The Gathering_ novels feature the Lupul, a shapeshifter. Its true form is a writhing mass of worms that devours people in order to steal their forms.
-   Florian Honeywell is a rare, openly heroic example, in Of Blood And Honey. He is a walking, talking beehive with honey for blood and honeycombed flesh. Fortunately for him, he at least appears normal on the surface. He's decided to use his ability to control the bees who live in him to fight crime, and is on his way to be a Kid Hero.
-   In _The Talismans of Shannara_, Walker Boh is attacked by The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (well, actually monsters who have taken the form of The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse). While Famine, War and Death are humanoids, Pestilence is just a swarm of infection-spreading insects moving about in a vaguely humanoid shape.
-   Played straight in Dean Koontz's _Seize the Night_, by the _things_ that came back through the egg room in Hodgson's suit. They may have come from an Alternate Universe, or from the future via Time Travel, neither of which is a comforting thought.
-   In the Sequel Series to _The Spiderwick Chronicles,_ a group of _dragons_ have become this over the centuries as their tails have become stuck together by the filth surrounding them. The Hero defeats them by cutting apart the muck binding their tails. Since they've been used to existing as one creature for so long, they become confused after their separation and are easier for the helpful giants to defeat. These dragons were based on the legendary "Rat King" (see the section for Mythology and Religion below), and in homage to this inspiration, the third book in the Sequel Series is called _The Wyrm King._
-   _Star Carrier_:
    -   _Earth Strike_ has the nonsentient "shadow swarmers" of Eta Boötis IV, a colony creature that separates itself into thousands of smaller creatures that resemble a cross between a leaf and a sand dollar. The smaller creatures range across hundreds of kilometers in search of food (carbonaceous rock formations), then alert each other with ultrasound when they find some.
    -   _Center of Gravity_ introduces the H'rulka, 200-meter Living Gasbags that live in the atmospheres of hydrogen-helium gas giants. They're sapient, and their name for themselves roughly translates as "All of Us".
-   “The Stormlight Archive _has Dysian Aimian, most heavily feature in_ Edgedancer _and_ Dawnshard''. They are creatures composed of hundreds, if not thousands of tiny crustaceans which the Hive Mind breeds to fulfill a specific purpose, like storing memories or seeing. They can function individually, even at great distances, and the Bizarre Alien Biology of the planet means that "cremlings" (a generic term for small crusacteans) are all over the place, meaning they can spy on virtually anyone at any time. They can even make up a basic human shape, although most of them are quite bad at it, with only a few actually being able to pass as humans up close, and even those tend to struggle to act like humans. They are more or less immortal as individual hordelings are replaced, and killing a them means ensuring that almost all the hordelings are killed at once. Although people (understandably) find them very creepy they aren't villains or evil.
-   A benign example from _Swimmy_ by Leo Lionni featured fish being eaten by a larger fish. They formed their school into the shape of an even bigger fish and chased it off.
-   In _Those That Wake_, Man in Suit has slimy, wriggling things inside of him; it's unclear as to whether they inhabit him or if they're what he's made of, or if it's all just part of Mike's dream.
-   In _The Tractate Middoth_ by M R James, the ghost is implied to be a human spirit possessing a horde of spiders and shaping a human form out of them and their webs.
-   _Un Lun Dun_:
    -   While not a villain, this contains a passing reference to a man made of bees arguing with a bear.
    -   And Skool, who is a bunch of fish inside a wetsuit. He's also a rare heroic version of this.
-   _Wild Cards_: John Hive is turned into a sapient swarm of wasps by the Mass Super-Empowering Event.
-   _Worm_: The protagonist invokes this trope using her power to control insects. She surrounds herself with bugs both to make her harder to see and to intimidate people, and makes the insects around her buzz and chirp whenever she talks to complete the illusion of a giant humanoid insect swarm. She also picks up a trick of using decoys, piling masses of insects in a roughly humanoid form that looks exactly like she's pulling the previous trick.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ gives us Hive, the Big Bad of Season 3. An ancient human who was abducted by the Kree and engineered to lead their armies, he rebelled against his creators and lead the Inhumans against them. However, he was so evil and terrifying that the Inhumans banded together with regular humans to banish him to a faraway planet, with HYDRA being formed as a Death Cult to bring him back. It's not entirely clear exactly _what_ he is even at the end of the season, but as it goes on Simmons speculates that he's actually a swarm of many tiny parasites purposed to perform a variety of different tasks, such as reanimating dead bodies to serve as hosts, devouring proteins from living humans, and enslaving other Inhumans by drawing them into his Hive Mind. We see a brief glimpse of him as a worm-like creature when he exits Will Daniels' body to inhabit Grant Ward, but later information suggests that this form is also composed of many small parasites that collectively house his consciousness.
-   _Andromeda_: A guest turned out to be composed of nanobots.
-   Norman Pfister from the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ episodes "What's My Line?: Part 1"/"Part 2". He's a group of maggots that can appear like a man (but not for very long, as he starts to go all Uncanny Valley). Xander and Cordelia manage to kill him by covering the floor in front of a door with glue. He turned into maggots to get through the door, got stuck in the glue, and was promptly stomped to death.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Vashta Nerada, who are normally a mass of tiny _things_ that live in the shadows and devour meat. If they get inside a person's sealed spacesuit, though, the person will be devoured to the bone, and the Vashta Nerada will animate the spacesuit.
    -   Davros' servant Colony Sarff is a collection of snakes coiled around each other to form the shape of a man. While there is one snake much larger than the others that forms the core, they are apparently a "democracy", and will occasionally have the individual snakes take a vote on their next move.
-   _Extraterrestrial (2005)_: Hysterias are normally microscopic aquatic creatures, but when food grows scarce gather in large swarms that act and move like singular beings.
-   _Farscape_: One episode has a colony of horrible spider-like things that can do this and impersonates one of the regular cast.
-   _Lexx_: In the third movie, _Eating Patterns_, the crew of the Lexx stumbles onto an isolated colony of scavengers who are infested with wormlike parasites. The Queen Worm, which is roughly the size of a Sea Monster, creates fake people to act as its eyes and ears on the rest of the colony.
-   _Power Rangers_ has done this to spice up the Monster of the Week.
    -   In _Power Rangers in Space_, thousands of all-devouring monster termites could come together to make a monster, who was pretty hard to damage because hitting him just knocked loose a few of the pests.
    -   Also, Craterites — holo-Mooks used in training simulations — came to life and terrorized town (and it _wasn't_ the usual villains' doing.) Eventually, they came together to make a humanoid mishmosh of themselves that was Humongous Mecha scale.
-   _Pushing Daisies_: The season two premiere has a woman who claims she was killed by a man made of bees, which causes Chuck to ruminate on the possibilities of teaching her bees to form a human shape.
-   _Reaper_ has an episode with a woman made of bugs.
-   _Super Sentai_:
    -   _Doubutsu Sentai Zyuohger_ Big Bad Genis is ultimately revealed to be a mass accumulation of Moebas, regarded as the lowest life form in the universe. His destruction of entire planets for the Blood Games is due to his self-loathing and desire to prove his superiority to other organisms.
    -   _Mashin Sentai Kiramager_: The Big Bad Yodon is a mass of snakes clumped together into the rough shape of a person.
-   A few _Ultra Series_ Monsters of the Week, usually of the bloodsucking parasite variety for some reason.
    -   Arindo from _Ultraman Taro_ starts off as a swarm of giant termites, who can chew through metal and concrete, until they're driven off by pesticide fired by the ZAT. The termites respond by merging themselves into a building-sized kaiju that goes on a rampage through the city.
    -   The Okorin Balls from _Ultraman 80_ are a species of bloodsucking ball-like aliens that invade Earth and attack humans. They are led by a single giant member of their kind who commands the rest to merge with it, becoming a giant bipedal mass to battle Ultraman 80 and UGM.
    -   Magnia from _Ultraman Tiga_ are alien parasites spawned from a sentient meteor to find it food. When the space rock is endangered by GUTS' assault, the Magnia merge into a kaiju form, only to get their butts whooped by Tiga.
    -   Maricula from _Ultraman Dyna_ are mutated lake algae that merge themselves into a singular form after consuming enough blood.
    -   The Dobishi from _Ultraman Gaia_, a swarm of alien insects that herald the arrival of Zogu, come in numbers so vast that they can create _multiple_ Worms That Walnown as Kaiser Dobishi to overwhelm Gaia and Agul.
    -   Chaos Bug from _Ultraman Cosmos_ is a swarm of fireflies corrupted by Chaos Header into ravenous monsters that eventually join themselves with a pile of scrapped electronics into a kaiju form and battle Cosmos.
    -   Peginera from _Ultraseven X_ is a parasitic space organism made from thousands of tiny individuals answering to a Hive Mind. It took over the pharmaceutical company Nano Cybertech and sold each of its individual cells as a drug that enhanced human brain processing, in exchange for becoming Peginera's slaves.
-   One scene in the _Walt Disney Presents_ episode "Mars and Beyond" shows a pursuing alien transforming from a swarm of insects back into his true form while chasing a secretary.

    Music 

-   The Music Video for "The Beeching Report" by iLiKETRAiNS features a colony of insects taking on human form and battling Dr. Beeching himself. The trope is then subverted in that Beeching is unafraid of the colony (which represents railway workers laid off because of the Beeching axe) and simply crushes the insects.
-   The music video for Rammstein's Links 2-3-4 has a horde of giant insects coming to destroy some ants. The ants then eat the giant insects, and then _dance on their corpses_.
-   The music video for Squirrel Nut Zippers' "The Ghost of Stephen Foster" (styled like an old Fleischer Studios animation) shows a giant rat doorman at the Hotel Paradise who is comprised of a group of much smaller rats who wield pitchforks.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   Downplayed example: Azhi Dahaka, a three-headed dragon associated with the Zoroastrian apocalypse, has scorpions instead of blood.

    Podcasts 

-   In _The Hidden Almanac_, there's a running joke that the host Reverend Mord may be an example. He's never seen except in a full-body-covering Plague Doctor outfit, and his colleague Pastor Drom believes he's actually a swarm of beetles in a suit (but she's The Ditz, so that in itself doesn't necessarily prove anything). He's eventually revealed to be a miraculously animated plant attended _by_ a swarm of beetles in a plague doctor outfit.
-   _The Magnus Archives_ features both worm and spider versions of this in multiple episodes, most prominently Arc Villain Jane Prentiss, a normal girl who was taken over by an extradimensional worm swarm known as the Flesh Hive.
-   In _Welcome to Night Vale_ episode 29, it's implied that the deer-masked subway representatives are this.

    Roleplay 

-   In _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_, this is what Jenna is turned into during the Mass Super-Empowering Event. She becomes a form of consciousness that takes control of any nearby insects and uses them to form her physical body. If any of them die, then more insects will be taken over to replace them.
-   In _Roll To Dodge: Savral_, liches are undead made out of billions upon billions of spiders. A few temple guards also transform into spider-swarm organisms after being hit with a spell from one of the players.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Call of Cthulhu_: The name first appeared in the _Shadows of Yog-Sothoth_ adventure "The Worm That Walks" as the name of a monster that was **not** made out of worms. An example called "the Crawling One" appeared in the original Chaosium version, in the _Shadows of Yog-Sothoth_ adventure "The Watchers of Easter Island". It was based on a creature that appeared in the Lovecraft story "The Festival":
    
    _\[H\]appy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain, and happy the town at night whose wizards are all ashes. For…the soul of the devil-bought hastes not from his charnel clay, but fats and instructs the very worm that gnaws; till out of corruption horrid life springs, and the dull scavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it. Great holes secretly are digged where earth’s pores ought to suffice, and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl._
    
-   _Carcosa: Weird Science-Fantasy Horror Setting_. The Unquiet Worms monster is a horrid collection of worms that takes a vaguely humanoid shape and walks like a man. They're created when a Sorcerer dies and the worms that eat his brain gain his knowledge.

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The worm that walks, introduced in the 3rd Edition _Epic Level Handbook_ and recurrent in the game since then, is a dead spellcaster that has become the Hive Mind for an army of worms, gaining insect-related powers and a great deal of additional resilience. Usually it's the evil ones that choose this method of life after death. Players can actually turn themselves into a Worm That Walks, although it carries a chance of failing and just leaving them as a rotting corpse. Later editions rename them larva mages, but keep the lore more or less the same.
    -   The _Elder Evils_ sourcebook features a unique Worm That Walks, a really _big_ one: Kyuss, a would-be god that turned into something far, far worse and became the progenitor of a tremendous variety of worm-themed monsters, and serves as the Big Bad of an extensive adventure path titled _Age of Worms_.
    -   The 3rd Edition _Monster Manual 2_ describes the Leechwalker, a bloated bipedal monster made of millions of leeches that have formed a hive mind, and which can drain a person of all their blood in seconds.
    -   4E introduces a number of monsters related to larva mages. Larva assassins are formed when the soul of a Psycho for Hire is given form through a swarm of hornets and centipedes. Larva snipers were Cold Snipers (or at least sadistic marksmen) in life, now an undead composed of wasps. Larva war masters were General Rippers, Blood Knights and similar depraved, insane warriors in life, their souls called back and thrust into undeath as the Hive Mind of a swarm of carnivorous beetles.
    -   The lamia from 4th Edition is an evil fey creature which is a seething swarm of scarab beetles wrapped around the flesh-stripped bones of a powerful fey creature. Many lamias take the form of eladrin that they've hollowed out this way.
    -   The great-granddaddy of all these _D&D_ worms that walk is the cifal, a rather forgettable colonial-insect monster from the 1E _Fiend Folio_. ("Cifal" is actually an acronym that stands for "Colonial Insect-Formed Artificial Life".) Whom they just dumped into the recent version of _Gamma World_, along with all the other effed-up ''D&D'' monsters
    -   A rare Good-aligned version appears in, of all places, the Eldritch Abomination\-filled _Lords of Madness_ 3.5 sourcebook, with the silthilar — sapient swarms with just a touch of the Mad Scientist when they fuse into their solid form.
    -   _Ravenloft_ has maggot golems. While disgusting, these golems have a clever design. The living maggots that make up the golem's body continually grow into flies (which swarm around the golem, constantly) and so long as the maggots and flies can feed on rotted meat (usually provided by creatures it kills) the flies lay eggs on the golem, which hatch more maggots, creating a continual cycle that give the golem a powerful regenerative ability.
    -   Yet another version from 3.5, in the _Exemplars of Evil_ book (for designing villains) is the former archmage of the Tolstoff family who researched the deceased god the Worm That Walks, learned evil spells, acquired foul magic items, and made pacts with dark entities. Eventually the deity noticed him and "rewarded" him with its filthy blessing, an attack of ravenous worms and maggots that ate his physical body but which absorbed his soul. Sealed in a vault within the catacombs beneath the mansion by his horrified daughter, he then proceeds to whisper and corrupt his grandchildren into evil servants who will stop at nothing to free him from his tomb. (He would later appear as The Dragon in the scenario for Kyuss (see above) in _Elder Evils_.)
    -   The 5E version of this creature is the Star Spawn Larva Mage from _Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_. This version turns into a swarm of worms upon being reduced to 0hp. Unless this subsequent swarm is also killed, the mage will return to life in 24 hours.
    -   The Tsochari are a race of Puppeteer Parasite aberrations that begin life as unintelligent worm-like strands that fuse together with each other form an intelligent colony. A tsochar can live forever even though the strands that compose them have a finite lifespan as long as they regularly fuse with new strands.
    -   _Forgotten Realms_: Kezef the Chaos Hound is a legendary Hellhound in the form of a writhing mass of maggots clinging to a canine skeleton.
    -   5th edition sourcebook _Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft_ has the wererat Darklord, Jacqueline Renier, from Richemulot using the state guard called the Casques Silencieux. The Casques Silencieux aren't human at all, in fact they're swarms of rats that are housed in suits of armor which they animate. Jacqueline has the ability to telepathically communicate and influence these rats, making them the perfect loyal enforcers.
    -   The third-Party publisher Dreamscarred Press has released a sourcebook called _Phrenic Scourges_, who embody this trope. They're a hive-mind of worms that will be happy to convert you into fawning slave, or the next generation of worms, or both.
-   _Earthdawn_ 1st edition lists a creature called Wormskull that is just that — a humanoid creature with a mass of worms as its head (a wormskull's body can look different, however, and is usually heavily armoured).
-   _Eclipse Phase_: One of the many Synth bodies resembles a swarm of robotic bees. They can move as a regular swarm, or combine into a roughly human-shaped mass. They're also fully playable, and far more affordable than those based around Organic Technology.
-   _Exalted_:
    -   Wyld mutants with the "Hive" abomination. One rank in "hive" and they have a beehive or snake nest or similar somewhere on their bodies. Two ranks in "Hive" and the nest expands to include the rest of them, turning them into a hollow skin moved about by swarming creatures — whether the original being is still alive at this point is a highly dubious matter.
    -   Scarab guardians, minor deities who serve as guardians of places that gods or powerful Exalts want never to be disturbed, manifest as swarms of black beetles that share a single mind. These beetles can come together to form a humanoid body, which the scarab guardian usually does when it needs to threaten people or warn them away from its charge.
    -   Mursilis, one of the souls of the Yozi Oramus, is an odd example. Rather than being a hive-minded mass of bugs in the shape of a person, it's a hive-minded mass of bugs in the shape of a forest.
-   _Gamma World_: One of the possible character origins. Depending on your primary origin and your secondary origin, you could be anything from a swarm of cockroaches to a mass of nanomachines to a horde of sapient, hive-minded kittens.
-   _Godforsaken_:
    -   Worms that walk, described in the setting-neutral worldbuilding section, are masses of psionic grubs squirming through a slush of salty ooze. Individually the grubs are harmless vermin, but together they're a sapient entity, a single psionic mind formed of thousands of tiny, maggot-like pupae.
    -   The spiders of the Comerelk jungle are moved by a single Hive Mind. At need, this mind can gather up a few thousand bodies and arrange them into a single mass in the form of a colossal spider.
-   _Grimm_ has this in the form of Rapunzel. Yes, that Rapunzel. Only this time around, her prince passed away, her children grew and she had nothing to do but return to the tower where she lived out the rest of her days. The tower, though, had developed intelligence and gotten lonely in her long absence and took measures to keep her there even after she died. Namely, having her corpse infested with a swarm of spiders that will kill and eat any who climb her hair to the tower. Keep in mind that the rules of the game are built specifically around children and boys are particularly drawn to the silky locks that still hang out the window. She's also one of the sample NPCs that made the transition when the game was converted to its own rules system.
-   _Little Fears_: Worms are monsters that gather into groups and mimic the forms of children. The problem is that they can't mimic eyes, so they have to actually kill children and steal their eyes to pull it off convincingly.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_: The Planeswalker Grist, the Hunger Tide. Technically, she's just a single insect with the power to control others of her kind (this is symbolized by her being considered a small Insect-type creature when she's anywhere but in play.) However, when she invokes her powers, she forms herself a humanoid body composed of multiple vermin all working together.
-   _Mutants & Masterminds_: _Freedom City_ features a villain called The Collective, which follows this trope. As every other character in that entire setting, he is a Captain Ersatz of an existing comic book character, probably Marvel's Swarm (see comic section above).
-   _Numenera_: Naiadans are a species of beings whose bodies are entirely composed of thousands of tiny creatures called dyremmi, all acting together to form a larger individual being. There are also naiadapts, the descendants of humans modified to have colonies of dyremmi living in their bodies and acting as extensions of their beings. Naiadans and naiadapts can alter their bodies and abilities by simply removing some of the dyremmi currently making them up and exchanging them for new ones carrying a desired trait, altering themselves by manipulating the balance of their component creatures. "Wild" dyremmi also exist, some of which are reported to have developed individual intelligence and see the naiadans and naiadapts as horrific conglomerations that must be destroyed to free their "enslaved" dyremmi.
-   _Pathfinder_:
    -   Worms that walk are creatures created when a dead spellcaster's soul takes control of the vermin that fed upon their corpse, shapes them into a serviceably humanoid form and claws their way out of their grave and back to life. Most are composed of earthworms, but specific areas and unusual situations can give rise to worms that walk made up of ants, wasps, cockroaches, locusts, and stranger things — fetal bats are explicitly bought up as a possible component.
    -   The Archdevil Baalzebul is a Fallen Angel whose body was stripped away and transformed into a cloud of flies by Asmodeus.
    -   The galvo is an aggressive, predatory aberration in the form of a humanoid made of squirming, ever-discharging _electric eels_.
    -   Exaggerated by the ouroboros, a titanic extraplanar being that combines this trope with Droste Image: it's a gigantic snake whose body is made up of smaller snakes. Which are made of even smaller snakes. Which are made of, et cetera, right down to the atomic level.
-   _Rifts_: The Worm Wraiths in _New West_ are evil _Cowboy_ Worms That Walk. Also invoked by the Horseman Pestilence, which is actually a giant walking skeleton covered in bugs instead of flesh and skin.
-   _Scarred Lands_: One of the monsters described in _Creature Collection II: Dark Menagerie_ are vermin hosts, former human vagrants who were cursed by one of the evil gods who was angry that they happened to pray to another god other than him to let them live another day in their dismal squalor. From this Disproportionate Retribution he had various vermin (rats, roaches, leeches, spiders) burrow into their skin, giving them Cursed with Awesome powers as they are able to use their new abilities to control their own swarm of vermin, turn into giant anthropomorphic versions of those vermin, and disintegrate into swarms to help escape enemies or commit espionage (which the spider vermin hosts do most of the time). As a side note, they're able to reproduce The Virus style by allowing one of their vermin to infect a person, whose whispers of power and whatnot usually cause them to accept them thereby summoning a larger swarm of that vermin which turns them into new vermin hosts while inheriting some of the memories of the previous ones. This is also squick because, mind you, the vermin are always moving under the host's skin to find more comfortable areas to rest. Remember one of those vermin are large rats!
-   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_: The Hollow Men, a breed of fomori (humans under the thrall of Demonic Possession). The Hollow Men specifically are humans who were killed and whose bodies were mostly emptied out (hence the name), the insides replaced by a swarm of small animals controlled by the demonic spirit in question. Doesn't have to be insects/arachnids; reptiles and rodents are also popular choices. They're capable of speech and can _try_ to pass themselves off as fully human, but generally, even other fomori find them creepy as hell.
-   _Werewolf: The Forsaken_: The Azlu are spirit-like creatures that can do something similar. In their case, only one of the spiders is really "them", so they escape by using the weight of numbers — the odds of the real one getting killed are incredibly small. The Beshilu of the same game are similar. They're rats, not bugs, but can hollow out human bodies and control them like the Fomori mentioned above.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   _Dark Heresy_: The Slaugth are an entire race of these. The trope is even mentioned by name.
        
        _"The worm that walks has come for us all" Found carved into a bulkhead, Watchpost Hazeroth/Sentry 17. All hands lost, attacker unknown. 123.M40_
        
    -   _Death Of Antagonis_ contains a truly disturbing inversion where a particularly nasty Chaos Daemon manifests itself in the form of a gigantic worm made out of the bodies of every human being on the title planet.
-   _Warhammer_: Apophas of Numas was a Nehekharan prince who murdered his family and was executed by being sealed into a coffin filled with Neheakaran Scarabs. His body was reduced to his skull, upon which a cursing rune was carved. In the Netherworld, he made a deal with the God of Death. He promised to bring him someone who was his equal to take his place. His soul was given command over the scarabs who ate him alive, and he scours the world for his equal. But, no two souls are truly equal, and he is damned to wander the world forever.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_:
    -   Zaktan, who used to be a singular entity and still retains a singular consciousness after becoming this trope. When his old boss tried to vaporize him, he was somehow able to pull himself back together as microscopic "protodites". In this new, permanent state, Zaktan can easily avoid attacks by turning into an insect swarm; change the shape of body parts; heal damage by filling the gaps with Protodites; and engulf a foe in an attack that must feel like getting hit with thousands of needles. Zaktan himself calls it a curse however, as his voice now sounds like a crowd speaking; and whenever he wakes up he can feel his body shifting "where there once were tissue and solid metal".
    -   A heroic version shows up in the _Legend Reborn_ movie. Team Pet Click (a beetle) summons and teams up with a swarm of fellow beetles to form a giant warrior that makes the evil army figuratively mess their pants.
-   The Vermillion Army in _Ninjago_. Unlike the Serpentine, the franchise's other race of Snake People, they're made out of multiple snakes held together within their armor, and as such multiple warriors can combine together to form a larger being.

    Video Games 

-   _Anthem (2019)_ has the Scars; essentially colony-swarms that imitate other forms of life, and they've decided that humanity is the best thing to emulate. They're not especially intelligent by themselves, but they're excellent scavengers and surprisingly good with technology. Swarms that grow old enough and large enough can become _Escari_ — more intelligent, more cunning, and most of all, _more ambitious_.
-   Kelvin from _Battleborn_ may appear to be a gigantic skeletal ice golem but in reality he's an entire microorganism civilization with a single consciousness.
-   Ananzi, from _The Black Heart_, is not quite one, but with the ease she produces spiderlings out of nowhere, she comes close.
-   Arakune from _BlazBlue_ fits this trope faithfully. What makes him horrifying is that he used to be human before a hideous accident, and his current form is very much a case of And I Must Scream.
-   One of the 5 bounties in _Bug Fables_ is the False Monarch, a cluster of mothflies disguised as one bug, and it uses said mothflies to attack Team Snakemouth.
-   The monstrous protagonist of _Carrion_ is implied to be this. Severed tentacles slither away when it gets shot, if part of its body is severed by the environment those same severed tentacles slither back to it, and it gets the ability to discorporate into a horde of threadworms in deep water.
-   Throughout _Castle Red_, there are numerous scenes in which the hero is attacked and knocked out by strange hooded figures. If you avoid the first four endings and make it to the Very Definitely Final Dungeon, these hooded figures will become standard enemies who reveal themselves as this trope when damaged.
-   _Castlevania_
    -   The boss of Stage 2 in _Castlevania: Dracula X_ is a group of bats that come together to form one giant bat. It turns back to them when hit.
    -   The boss of the Nostalgia Level in _Dawn of Sorrow_ is Bat Company, a pack of red bats that assumes various forms as one. Dracula himself is often shown moving around as a pack of bats.
    -   Also the reoccurring Boss Legion is a giant Sphere of Zombies covering a giant monster. In _Symphony of the Night_, it periodically sheds zombies that attack independantly.
-   _Dandara_: Eldar presents himself as a masked man in a suit, but he's really a massive collection of consumeristic thoughts, hence the name of his second boss form: "Them, Eldar: The Relentless Choir".
-   _Dark Chronicle_ (aka _Dark Cloud 2_) had the Rainbow Butterfly boss that split into different-coloured butterflies the PC had to sneak up on and swat to death.
-   _Dark Souls_:
    -   Gravelord Nito from _Dark Souls_ is this made out of _human skeletons_.
    -   _Dark Souls II_ has a similar creature, The Rotten, except the bodies _it's_ made of _aren't skeletons yet_.
    -   The graveyard outside the Cathedral of the Deep in _Dark Souls III_ is populated not only by _lots_ of undead, but also creatures made out of huge carnivorous maggots they can inflict you with. They come both in free-roaming forms and bursting out of undead enemies' bellies The Thing\-style.
-   The Dividers from the _Dead Space_ series are actually a small colony of Necromorphs that bind together into a single, human-like entity. They fall apart once enough damage has been dealt to their combined form, requiring even more ammo to put the pieces down.
-   Scarecrow (arm), Scarecrow (leg) and Mega Scarecrow from _Devil May Cry 4_ are all basically burlap sacks filled with beetles with blades attached.
-   In _Dominions_, there is the spell ''Call the Worm that Walks". It is a powerful nature mage who escaped mortality by turning into this.
-   In the _Fallen London_ universe, Sorrow Spiders are already dangerous on their own, what with being the size of cats and having a penchant for tearing people's eyes out. But when enough of them get together, they can form Spider-Councils, which are great, shambling masses of spider-flesh that are significantly smarter and utterly vicious. Small ones can give entire town districts a hell of a lot of trouble. Bigger ones, as seen in _Sunless Sea_, can get big enough to pose as dreadnought ships, sail them and become terrors of the sea on par with Mount Nomad. But it doesn't end there. In _Sunless Skies_, you can eventually meet the culmination, a Spider-Senate, which amounts to an Eldritch Abomination made out of _billions and billions of spiders_. The thing was imprisoned by the Judgements themselves because it was a direct threat to them, but they simply couldn't kill it.
    -   Devils are a smaller scale version of this. Though each one acts like an individual human (or human-esque individual) they are actually quite literally bee hives in skin suits. Yes, _hives_.
-   In the PC Engine CD version of _Golden Axe_, Death Adder merges together from hundreds of snakes.
-   _Halo_:
    -   The Hunters are composed of hundreds of orange-red worms called Lekgolo. Plated armor protects these worms from conventional weapons and a high-powered energy cannon of doom deals with their foes, though even without all that gear, they were enough of a match for the Covenant's Elites that they had to be orbitally bombarded to be forced to fall in line. Once a Hunter colony grows large enough, it splits into two separate ones that share a bond, becoming Bash Brothers who go out on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge if one of them dies within sight/hearing of the other. Since the individual worms aren't advanced life forms in the same way humans and the other members of the Covenant are, they're also immune to direct infection from the Flood. That said, while an individual Lekgolo is rather dumb, the Hunters themselves are actually quite intelligent. The Hunters are also somewhat unusual in that unlike most examples on this page, they're simply Punch-Clock Villain\-Starfish Aliens, who are not especially malicious or sinister beyond being really good at killing you. In fact, when the Covenant breaks, many of the Hunters actually side with the human-friendly Elites.
    -   In fact, the Hunters are only one of the many gestalt types that Lekgolo can form. The gigantic Scarabs from _Halo 2_ onward are partially comprised of a whole bunch of worms as well; the manual for _Halo: Reach_ even implies that they are not so much true vehicles as much as massive suits of Powered Armor for the Lekgolo. Case in point: In the level "The Covenant", one of the two Scarabs that drop from orbit rears up and roars, while in _Halo: Reach_, one actually roars in pain when it's destroyed by Carter ramming his Pelican into it.
-   Atticus Thorn, the Big Bad of _The Haunted Mansion_ video game.
-   The Guy Made of Bees from the _Kingdom of Loathing_, which is exactly what it sounds like. When you beat him, he drops a Guy Made of Bee Pollen. You can also pickpocket a handful of them.
-   Jalhalla in _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_ is a giant Poe made up of twenty smaller Poes and a mask that seems to either control or coordinate them.
-   The first boss of the final levels in _Mega Man X6_ is called the Nightmare Mother, a pair of giant square-shaped masses composed of a large number of Nightmare Viruses.
-   _Metal Gear_:
    -   The Pain from _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_, while not composed of bees, is able to control bees by having them sting him until the bees think that he is one of them. To make matters worse, he grows Bullet Bees within him. These ones fly to your body and gnaw at your flesh slowly — and yes, he grows them **within** his body, launching them from his mouth. Keeping true to the trope, he can make a life-sized, fully voiced clone of himself, made of — you guessed it — bees, or they can become a full-sized, working, wood-and-metal Tommy gun (for which the science behind the trick isn't explained until two games later).
    -   Organ-replacing parasites act as _Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain_'s Applied Phlebotinum, leading to several characters being this to a greater or lesser degree, including Skull Face, the Skulls, Quiet, and Code Talker. It's even implied that the supernatural powers of the Cobra Unit, including the Pain, are the result of parasite therapy.
    -   The Final Boss of _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_, Senator Steven Armstrong, is an Ambiguous Robot who somehow managed to hide his augmented nature from everyone despite being prominent in the public eye complete with presidential campaign, augmented by nanomachines in ways your team find unprecedented... except Doktor. He immediately starts theorizing it as a form of "Claytronics", with Armstrong being neither human nor a cyborg, but a thick morass of advanced nanomachines directed to shape, change appearance and harden at will: a huge, superpowerful heap of Grey Goo _pretending_ to be a human being, or at least feeling the part.
-   The very first boss of _Metroid: Other M_ is a swarm of purple bugs that form a body around a larger bug that makes up the eye.
-   In a more spiritual way, Ermac from _Mortal Kombat_ is this. He is the gathering of souls lost during Outworld's various wars, brought together to serve Shao Khan. As a result, Ermac never uses singular self-referential pronouns such as "I" or "me", instead opting for "us" or "we", in a sense allowing his body to speak on behalf of all the souls that he carries.
    -   D'Vorah, introduced in _Mortal Kombat X_ is a more standard sapient insect colony. She takes the form of a woman with buglike features (chitinous skin, compound eyes, etc). Since she's a walking hive, she refers to herself as "This One" instead of using singular pronouns.
-   In the Forbidden Sanctum DLC of _Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire_ you're introduced to forgotten Archmage Fyonlecg. After the Watcher bests him in combat (the first time), they remove his mask only to find he has replaced himself with a body double constructed from a writhing mass of worms.

    -   _Pokémon X and Y_:
        -   The Legendary Pokémon Zygarde is actually composed of many smaller green creatures known as Zygarde Cells (too small and weak to individually be called Pokémon), as well as other small creatures called Zygarde Cores, which serve as the "brains". The form Zygarde takes is actually determined by how many of the cells it has gathered to itself — the serpent-like form encountered in the games is actually only its "50 Percent" Forme, and it possesses a much stronger Complete Forme resembling a bipedal mecha-esque kaiju<small>◊</small>.
        -   Barbaracle is a humanoid mass of barnacles, although it downplays the trope a bit by being only seven creatures.
    -   In _Pokémon Sun and Moon_:
        -   The Water-type Wishiwashi is a small and individually weak fish that, through synchronized schooling with others of its kind, can become an enormous and powerful Sea Monster that is, on closer inspection, still composed of separate fish swimming together.
        -   _Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon_ introduces Stakataka (U.B Assembly), an Ultra Beast that resembles a brick building. Each "brick" is a separate life form that comprises the whole creature.
        -   Palossand's _Ultra Sun_ Pokédex entry mentions that _each of its grains of sand has free will_. As if that monstrous thing wasn't gruesome enough...
    -   In _Pokémon Sword and Shield_, Falinks is an inverted version, conceptually speaking. This Pokémon consists of six small Waddling Head creatures that like to arrange themselves in a tight single-file formation and move in perfect synchronization. This results in them looking like a giant caterpillar.
-   _Project Remedium_ have the Fattster enemies, fecal-shaped Giant Mook bacteria monsters. They're already there in the level you face them, but you can actually see regular-sized bacteria spores - dozens of them - merging into becoming an individual Fattster.
-   _Rayman Legends_ has Hades' Hand, which is made of lots of Dark Creatures.
-   _Resident Evil_:

-   _Stellaris_: Each "individual" of a fungal race is actually a colony of fungi that have collectively achieved sapience. Younger colonies tend to be the ones travelling around exploring space, since colonies only grow larger with age.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   The first _Luigi's Mansion_ game has Boolossus, which doubles as an Asteroids Monster. This monstrous ghost absorbs his 14 comrades to begin his battle. The Big Boo in the second game as well, absorbing 9 other ghosts.
    -   The Rubber Band in _Paper Mario: The Origami King_ is made from smaller rubber bands.

-   The "Unknown" boss in _Vanquish_ consists of a red core and pieces of robotic junk that assemble into various shapes.
-   _Vandyke_ have a giant boss which turns out to be a horde of worms inhabiting a set of robes.

    Webcomics 

-   _Awful Hospital_: Magdolene manifests as an Impossible Hourglass Figure made out of maggots around a humanoid skull, with "hair" of tiny flies.

He's swarmed and bitten so much his movements are slowed, and he screams that they're eating him alive.
-   Vance from _Grrl Power_ claims to be a mass of spiders in human shape, but it's unknown whether he's telling the truth of just messing with Sidney.

-   Gavotte, the head of the _Skin Horse_ department, is a sPient swarm of bees. She (?) is surprisingly congenial and enjoys having a cup of tea with her employees, but they're often somewhat unnerved by the disembodied voice and the offers of free honey.
    -   The storyline "Grillo Parlante" introduces Daisychain, a string of mice which, as the name suggests, are linked in series, and the hedgies, hedgehog-like plant-creatures that can assemble into a giant hedgie as a defence mechanism.
-   Laufian Slinten Pods in _Spacetrawler_ are bunches of snakes who operate as a single entity by wearing an ill-fitting disguise of another alien species. It's implied the disguises are all of a specific member of said species, as seen when "Nogg, a Thelbiunn" meets "Nogathulbium".
-   In a _Weregeek_ strip, during a _D&D_ game, a helpful hermit reveals himself to be a "worm that walks". The player refers to the aformentioned _Buffy_ episodes.

    Web Originals 

-   _Athyrmagaia_ has the Athyrmatherians, which, in a strange example of this trope, resemble familiar Earth animals like lions, gazelles and wildebeest: except that the head, thorax, abdomen and rump of each Athyrmatherian is a _separate animal_ of its own, having metamorphosed from four separate sibling larvae that then proceeded to unite at adulthood.
-   _Atop the Fourth Wall_: In a non-vermin example, Linkara once fought a monster that was made up of all 52 issues of _Countdown to Final Crisis_.
-   The _Bloody Urban_ animated special _Human_ has a swarm of newts masquerading as a human by wearing funny nose glasses and a trench coat.
-   _John Dies at the End_:
    -   A swarm of tiny insect-like aliens able to infest humans and walk around in their skin makes up the first abomination encountered, with the novel's characteristic sense of tact. "Just call me 'Shitload.' Because there’s a shitload of us in here." (A clever Shout-Out to Mark 5:9, we might add.)
    -   Later, the narrator's Hyundai gets carjacked by a human-shaped pile of cockroaches.
-   It's technically "the swarm of frog fetuses that crawls", but _Mortasheen_'s Ovulooge fits here like a glove. For a more traditional example (even though they don't quite look the part) are the Wormbrains. In their case, the creature itself is merely a (usually formerly human) meat puppet for the billions of parasitic worms living inside of it.
-   _New Life SMP_: The Swarm origin, held by Gem in her first life, is described as being made up of a group of bees.
-   One article in _The Onion_ is written by a pile of cockroaches pretending to be a human exterminator. The cockroachman attempts to convince people through the article it is writing to let cockroaches everywhere live and run free, but is unable to think of a compelling reason _why_. It also laments that it knows that After the End, cockroaches will rule the post-apocalyptic wasteland, but doesn't know _when_ that will happen.
-   _Orion's Arm_ has the Mucoid Empire. Living in Cyberspace and alien species of worm that can form hiveminds and superorganisms.

-   _SCP Foundation_:
-   One of the cut final lifeforms of _Serina_ is a descendant of ants that forms these, supported by the bones of their prey (which they seize with Combat Tentacles made from their own bodies) on which the ants themselves work as muscles. Fittingly, they're called shoggoths.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Western Animation 

-   _101 Dalmatian Street_: In "The Dog House", half of the pups attempt to disguise themselves as a human using a trench coat and fedora hat and a balloon for a head, and they use an app on a smart phone for the voice.

-   In _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, the heroes meet a huge swamp monster that consists entirely of vines and a wooden mask. Unusually for this trope, however, there's a guy inside, controlling the vines by bending the water in them. And that guy is a good guy; he's just using the disguise to scare away people who he feels are a threat to the swamp. Later on, when the Day of the Black Sun comes to pass, he comes back to aid the resistance, wearing a similar costume made from seaweed and the same mask.
-   In the first episode of _Ben 10 (2016)_, the villain uses a machine to attract and form a colossus entirely out of maggots to attack Las Vegas.

    **Cricket:** Rats! Rats! He's made of rats!
    
-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_:

-   One episode of _¡Mucha Lucha!_ was about Rikochet, Buena Girl, and the Flea confronting a giant spider-themed wrestler named Black Widower, who has been beating several insect-themed wrestlers all over town, and is threatening to do the same to the Flea.

    -   In the Nanobots episode, the bots coalesce into a Monobot. Since the girls were at Nano scale at that moment, it was trouncing them, but it was also big enough that the professor could simply stomp on it, ending the threat.
-   In _ReBoot_, we have Nulzilla. We also have Enzo and Dot's father, who can regain a bipedal form and his ability to speak by making a sprite-sized body of nulls, with the null that used to be him as the head. Both creatures were made possible through the powers of Hexadecimal.
-   _Rick and Morty_ gives us a rare heroic version in the superhero One Million Ants, who is... one million ants in a humanoid shape.

    Real Life 

-   While they can't construct a bipedal form and go for a walk, South American army ants regularly form nests and bridges from their own massed bodies.
-   Blister Beetle Grubs form themselves into the shape of the female of a certain species of bee, in order to lure it into trying to mate with the bee-of-worms, which secretes pheromones to help the process along ("Hey, that doesn't look like a bee and \*sniff sniff\* Oh Baby..."). Then they cling to the male and transfer to the female when Real Bee-boinking goes on, all to hitch a ride to the female's nest, which is full of tender bee larvae.
-   The Portuguese Man o' War looks like a floating jellyfish, but is, in fact, a colony of four organisms known as polyps. Its tentacles can grow to twenty metres in length (ten is the average) with a sting that can be very painful. Definitely not something you want to get tangled up with, especially since Portuguese Men o' War are most commonly found in large groups.
-   Slime molds are essentially single-celled organisms that every now and again come together to form composite creatures, up to roughly 30cm × 20cm in extreme cases.
-   Evolutionary biologists believe that multicellular organisms are descended from single-celled organisms that formed 3-D colonies.
    -   Likewise, eukaryotic cells probably arose when some oxygen-utilizing eubacteria set up housekeeping inside of anaerobic archaean bacteria, creating composite protists and fungi. When cyanobacteria joined the party, we got algae and (eventually) plants.
    -   More in the now, multicellular life (yes, including you) tends to host multitudes of bacteria and other single cell-organisms to mutual benefit.
-   Tubifex worms, in the absence of soil, will cling to each other. And to walls, which gives an effect not dissimilar to both this and Meat Moss.
-   Sawfly larvae climb over each other in order to move faster as a group.
-   Tropical trees don't walk, but they harbor enough symbiotic fungi, encrusting mosses or lichens, clinging vines and epiphytes, and boring invertebrates to constitute colonial super-organisms.
-   Clonal plant and fungal colonies: basically plants or fungi made out of smaller plants or fungi. While the component organisms don't live that long, some colonies are estimated to be 12,000 years old or older and may never die of old age.
-   Fungus gnat larvae band together to emulate a snake.
