**Charlotte "Charlie" Blackwood:** You didn't tell me you were a famous MiG insulter.  
**Lt. Pete "Maverick" Mitchell:** Would it have made a difference?  
**Charlie:** Not in the ladies' room, no.

Sometimes characters just need to get laid, no strings attached. Sometimes the strings get tangled up in their feet when they're not paying attention. This trope covers instances of a one-night stand followed by awkwardness when one participant encounters the other in an unrelated context the next morning. Frequently said context is at work, where the other party is the new guy (for extra awkwardness, s/he is the first character's supervisor). Of course, intercourse need not be involved, it's just that it usually is.

This may or may not be the start of a Romance Arc, and by extension may occur in romantic comedies.

Subtrope of Pre-Meeting.

The next morning Asami rushes to her college classes and guess who the professor is? It's Korra! Asami slyly uses their hook up to avoid getting in trouble with her flustered professor.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Downplayed in the film of _Logan's Run._ Logan was looking for a hookup on the city's "circuit" (pretty much a Zeerust Tinder), and ends up summoning Jessica to his apartment. Jessica apologizes, since she was looking for solace and not necessarily sex (one of her friends reached age 30 and was killed), and _definitely_ not a roll in the hay with one of the enforcement agents for said death-at-30 law. Logan sees her out, but they meet later when he's looking for information on the Runner's movement she belongs to.
-   Incredibly awkward in _Old School_. Mitch hooks up with a girl who turns out to be his boss's daughter. And she's still in _high school_. Then she shows up later while he's in the middle of a date.
-   _Top Gun_: The evening following orientation Maverick seduces a blonde named Charlotte Blackwood in the ladies room at a local bar to win a bet with Goose. Next morning he and Goose head out to the tarmac for a pre-exercise briefing and discover that the blonde, "callsign 'Charlie'", is an astrophysicist and civilian Top Gun instructor. They eventually end up as the film's Official Couple.
-   _Where the Truth Lies_: Karen and Lanny have sex shortly after meeting, while Karen is in New York and using her best friend's name. Later they meet for real when Vince meets with Lanny to work on Karen's book, which doesn't go well.

    Literature 

-   _Heroics_: This is how Casey and Zach met, according to Word of God.
-   Early in _Valor's Choice_ by Tanya Huff, Staff Sergeant Torin Kerr discovers that the di'Taykan she went to bed with the previous night is actually her platoon's new second lieutenant whom she was supposed to meet in the morning. In this case the awkwardness is only during the briefing and entirely on Torin's end: Taykans are hardly puritanical about sex and they have no trouble working together thereafter.

    Live-Action TV

-   In _Pepper Dennis_, the title character, a TV news reporter, finds out in the first episode that the man she had a one-night stand with is the new anchor for her station. Critics noted that _Grey's Anatomy_ had done a similar plot the previous year.
-   The _Quantico_ pilot has Alex Parrish meet Ryan Booth on a plane to Washington. After getting off the plane they have a quickie in his car. Six hours later they run into each other while taking the oath at the FBI Academy in Quantico. Cue awkwardness.
-   _Six Feet Under_: A variation happens in the first episode to Nate and Brenda. They both treat their semi-public tryst like just another hookup until Nate gets a call learning his father has died. Brenda drives him home, and a bond forms between them.

The three of them even get married at the end of Part 1.
