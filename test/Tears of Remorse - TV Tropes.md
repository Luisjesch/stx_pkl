_"They shall look on him whom they have thrust through, and they shall mourn for him as one mourns for an only son, and they shall grieve over him as one grieves over a first-born."_

Perhaps you have had a Heel Realization. Perhaps you are Dying as Yourself and have just learned the enormity of your deeds. Perhaps you have learned too late that the act you sought Revenge for was fully justified. Perhaps you have _failed_ in your one and only chance. Perhaps you were responsible for another's death; perhaps you know in your heart that you can never be forgiven for what you have just done. Now you can do nothing but cry. Maybe you are sobbing uncontrollably; maybe it's just a Single Tear — at this point you don't know or care. All you know is that the tears are going to fall and you cannot hold them back.

These are _universally_ the sign that some spark of goodness resides in the one who sheds them. No matter how far gone they seem to be, a character who weeps for an evil act is not yet a completely evil person. This does not always mean that reform is possible (tears may be the last gasp of the conscience before plunging completely over the Moral Event Horizon, for example). But they can be the start of redemption, especially if the hero can apply The Power of Trust; or better, The Power of Love.

A Sub-Trope of My God, What Have I Done?. Common in a Villainous BSoD — though Ignored Epiphany can still ensue. A good character Fighting from the Inside may shed these, even if they have shown no previous ability to resist the control.

May be a form of Manly Tears. Tender Tears combine when they are grief-stricken by minor injuries to others. They might offer the people they hurt a sincere apology, as well.

Contrast Tears of Joy.

-   In _Attack on Titan_, Reiner Braun and Bertolt Hoover break down in tears on separate occasions while admitting to the terrible things they've done.
-   In _Berserk_, a brief glimpse of Guts with his face fallen and tears in his eyes stops him from being a Villain Protagonist, and adds a lot more depth to (and questions about) his character.
-   _Code Geass_: Lelouch does this after he loses control of his Hypnotic Eye and accidentally forces his beloved half-sister to commit genocide, and has to shoot her to stop the bloody rampage.
-   In _Codename: Sailor V_ Minako cries only twice: the first because the first youma she killed happened to be the boy she was crushing on, and the other after killing the Big Bad Danburite, as he was her true love.
-   This is Played for Laughs in _Daily Lives of High School Boys_; when Habara frequently cries whenever her past as the Enfant Terrible\-level bully "Archdemon" was brought up.
-   _Digimon Adventure 02_ has former Big Bad Ken Ichijoji, who cries upon realizing that he's been sadistically torturing and killing living beings as catharsis for his The Un-Favourite and Dead Big Brother complexes without realizing that they were sentient. Plus, there are the real kids whose life he's been making a misery with his actions...
-   _Doraemon_: Occurs in "Soap Bubbles". Noby's friends cry tears of remorse after the Soap Bubble Straw forces them to feel guilty.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_: Vegeta of all people does this when he self-destructs to try to kill Majin Buu. Of course, being _Dragon Ball_, Buu recovers quickly.
-   Lucy from _Elfen Lied_ quite a few times, most notably from murdering her love interest Kouta's family in front of him in a jealous fit.
-   Zeref from _Fairy Tail_ does this whenever he kills anything. It makes it a little hard to take the rest of the cast seriously when they talk about how he's pure evil. At least, until he actually _resolves_ to kill something, in which case his eyes are giving off a much different look.
    -   From the same series, Amnesiac!Jellal is absolutely _broken_ when Erza — the only person he even slightly remembers — tells him that he was an utter bastard when last they met.
-   In _Ginga Densetsu Weed_, after being offered to heal their wounds in the hot spring by Gin, three of Hougen's generals (Baruge, Bat, and Kite) were so moved and touched by his kindness that they regret what they have done and cry tears of remorse, promising to never follow Hougen ever again.
    -   Also happens with Teru's father...just before he dies.
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_: Keiichi combines this with Tears of Fear and Berserker Tears in the first arc, and then just does this one in the sixth arc after remembering the incident that caused him to do this the first time from a slightly different point of view. And actually does it a second time in the sixth arc, when Rena, of all people, gives him a Hannibal Lecture about his Dark and Troubled Past.
    -   The sixth arc is full of this, actually (hence why it's called the Atonement Chapter). Rena does this there too.

The remorse in this case isn't so much for the deaths as it is for the fact that Johan is alive because of him.
-   Shizuru, after being resurrected in _My-HiME_. Considering her usually calm demeanor, this comes off as quite shocking.
    -   Also Yukino in an earlier incident; after trying to kill Mai to save Haruka's life, she later helps Mai to find Takumi when he's being attacked by Nao and Shiho. Mai thanks Yukino, with the implication of having forgiven her, and Yukino breaks down in tears before apologizing again.

    -   Sasuke then cries a single tear, after his final battle with Naruto, moved by the fact that despite everything he has done, his best friend utterly refuses to give up on helping and saving him. This is treated as the indication that he has finally repented and dropped his obsession with revenge for good.
-   Squard from _One Piece_ does this after he betrayed Whitebeard and stabbed him in the chest. When he realizes that the Marines played him like a fiddle and that Whitebeard still considers him a "son", Squad breaks down sobbing.
-   In the _XY_ arc of _Pokémon Adventures_, Shauna does this after it appears that she may have killed Viola, while brokenly asking if she really did this. While she was possessed and brainwashed at that moment, this shows that she's not under complete control.
-   Kahlua from _Rosario + Vampire_ might as well be the codifier, as every time she weeps, it's because she's about to kill somebody, despite her truly gentle nature.

-   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: Once Wonder Woman removes Circe's brainwashing Superman cries while apologizing for what he'd done while under it. Considering all he'd done was fight someone in his same weight class with added super quick healing abilities and cause a bit of property damage that blends right in with the damage from the greater fight going on at the time it comes across as rather out of touch. Especially as said fight is still ongoing and he could get up and help.
