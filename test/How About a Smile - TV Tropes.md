Smiles always work.

Simply put, this is any situation where a character has to force a smile or a please/thank you despite not really wanting to do so.

A few examples:

1.  Character A will demand something from Character B. Character B refuses to oblige their request until Character A says "please". Character A begrudgingly does so, and only then does Character B perform the requested action. This is commonly seen between parent and child, though it can occur between adults (typically for comic effect).
2.  Character A will want something from Character B. Character B refuses to give it to Character A until they give them a little smile to show their appreciation. Typically, Character A will put on a very forced smile.

It's most common in sitcoms, but can appear in dramatic works occasionally, such as if a villain is trying to smugly exert their power over the hero. The character asking for the smile might regret it if the smiling character has Scary Teeth. See Finger-Forced Smile or Glasgow Grin for more physical variants.
