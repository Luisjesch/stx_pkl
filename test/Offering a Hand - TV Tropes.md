"Do you trust me?" "...Yes."

_"We have a saying, my people. Don't kill if you can wound, don't wound if you can subdue, don't subdue if you can pacify, and don't raise your hand at all until you've first extended it."_

A turning point in a character's arc often reaches a climax with an offer from another, complete with one character extending their hand to the other.

They may be hoping to lead them somewhere, finalize an agreement, offer a dance, start a new friendship, or call a truce. In this trope, focus will be on the physical offer of a hand.

The second character may hesitate before answering to put emphasis on how important the decision is to the character arc. A rejection often means more than a rejection of the offer, but of the change the character would undergo, while an acceptance and a joining of hands indicates a pull toward the other character.

Both heroes and villains make these kinds of offers. If a hero's offer is rejected, it's a strong sign of disagreement with their values and is often a Redemption Rejection. Villains might make a We Can Rule Together offer.

If a villain succeeds, it might come with a Handshake of Doom, meaning that the villain has achieved, or is closer to achieving their objective.

Compare and contrast Take My Hand! which involves a life-or-death situation.

-   _Aladdin_ has a moment where the titular character, in disguise, offers Jasmine his hand before going for a ride on the magic carpet.

-   There's a moment in _The Emperor's New Groove_ where Pacha, still suspicious of Kuzco, offers a handshake, but only if Kuzco was serious about not destroying his village.

-   Several times in _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_:
    -   In _Rainbow Rocks_, after Princess Twilight returns to the human world through the portal and lands on the ground, Sunset Shimmer offers a hand to help her up, in an echo of Twilight having pulled Sunset out of a crater in the first film as Sunset renounced her villainy.

    -   In _Friendship Games_, Sunset extends her hand to Twilight's human counterpart, who initially withdraws in shame, having been unwillingly transformed into a Dark Magical Girl and fearing she can never be accepted after her actions. Twilight ultimately takes it after Sunset gives her her assurances.

Fed up with him, Marge and the kids abandon Homer.
-   _Turning Red_: This is something of a recurring image in the movie, to the point of symbolizing protagonist Meilin Lee's Character Development:
    -   Several times during the first two acts, Mei's mother Ming holds out her hand to Mei, who takes it and passively follows where Ming leads her. It shows how much Mei is under her mother's control.
    -   When Mei finally decides to break from her mother during the first red moon ritual, the first open sign of it is when Ming puts a reassuring hand on panda-Mei's paw and promises "we can do \[the ritual\] again." Mei pulls her paw away, refusing the contact - refusing to be led by her mother - for what is likely the first time in her life.
    -   The roles are reversed when Mei meets her mother on the astral plane. After she realizes how much alike she and her mother are, she doesn't hesitate to offer words of support and then a hand to Ming. Ming takes it, and Mei then leads the way to the exit portal.
    -   At the portal, Ming holds out her hand with one last appeal to her daughter, but Mei refuses to take it. It's possibly the hardest thing she's ever done, but she will no longer allow herself to be led anywhere she doesn't want to go.
-   This is a recurring theme in _Wall E_, used as a symbol of the movie's message about connecting with others. WALL-E himself sees hand-holding as the ultimate symbol of romantic love (a belief absorbed by watching _Hello, Dolly!_ repeatedly), and tries to reach out to EVE several times, only for her to either reject or ignore him. When it seems as though WALL-E's personality has been erased at the film's end, EVE finally takes his hand in hers to say goodbye...and WALL-E doesn't let go, revealing that The Power of Love has restored him to his former self.
    -   During the climax, AUTO attempts to foil the Captain's plans to return to Earth by rolling the _Axiom_ and making all of the incredibly fat humans fall out of their hover-chairs, sending them tumbling downward. When one man is panicking as he falls, a woman reaches out and catches his wrist, complete with a zoom-in on their hands. Other humans follow suit, allowing them to form chains that keep them from getting crushed.

-   In _Batman (1989)_, During a meeting of crime bosses, the newly-minted Joker calls for an alliance between the various mobsters.

Mollified, Antoine shakes the Joker's hand... only to find that he's wearing a lethal Electric Joybuzzer; over the next few seconds, the unfortunate gangster is fried to a crisp.
-   In _John Carter_, Carter offers Dejah Thoris his hand, explaining that it's an earth gesture to signify friendship.
-   _Jurassic Park_ features an overlap between this trope and Take My Hand! when Grant finds Tim trapped in the wrecked tour car high in a tree and extends a hand to help him out; Tim initially doesn't accept, embarrassed about having gotten sick in the car, and it's implied that, like Lex, he's hesitant to trust an adult after having been abandoned by Gennaro during the _T. rex_ attack. In this sense, Grant is both offering to get Tim out of danger and trying to show that he's trustworthy. Unfortunately, when Grant climbs further into the car so that Tim can reach him, he accidentally destabilizes the vehicle by gripping the steering wheel, which eventually sends it plummeting and nearly kills them.

-   _Leverage_: In _"The San Lorenzo Job"_ Sophie teaches Vittori to use the offered hand as a gesture to earn people's trust and goodwill. It actually comes in handy towards the end of the episode, when Vittori uses it to get members of the San Lorenzo military to come to his side.
    
    **Vittori:** We came here to announce that we have won the election. I am president of San Lorenzo! The first moments of my regime are stained with blood by those who wanted to steal our freedom.

    Theatre 

-   _A Very Potter Sequel_: Parodies Draco Malfoy's offer of friendship to Harry Potter from the book (see above) by having Draco list all the reasons why Harry _shouldn't_ be friends with him. It goes over just as well as you'd expect.

    Video Games 

-   _Destiny 2_: At the climax of _Beyond Light_'s Season of the Chosen, this trope is invoked to complete the Crow's arc for the season. Upon resurrection, all Guardians lose any memory of their past lives, and by common convention, Guardians are supposed to be absolved of their past life's crimes, as they have effectively become a new person. In Crow's case, however he's been the subject of abuse and hatred from almost every Guardian that encounters him, and he has no idea why. This is because the Crow is the resurrected Uldren Sov, the Arc Villain of _Forsaken,_ and murderer of Cayde-6. Crow had taken to wearing a mask to protect his identity, especially while working alongside the Vanguard, who were Cayde's friends and partners but he loses this while protecting Commander Zavala from an assassination attempt. Zavala, once the immediate threat was dealt with, turns to ask Crow if he's all right, and sees his unmasked face. He takes a moment to process what he's seeing, but then offers his hand to help Crow to his feet.

    -   In "The Cutie Re-Mark Part 2", after two episodes of fighting Starlight Glimmer in order to stop her changes to the timeline, Twilight finally tries to reason with Starlight and offers her hoof in friendship, to prove to Starlight that she is capable of making friends without differences tearing them apart. Starlight tentatively takes it, signaling her Heel–Face Turn.
    -   In "To Where and Back Again Part 2", in a parallel to the above, Starlight Glimmer encourages Queen Chrysalis to become a positive leader to the newly-reformed changelings, and offers her hoof in friendship. Chrysalis seems tempted, then slaps Starlight's hoof away and vows revenge on her.

        -   There's a repeat of this in "Hollow Mind" where Luz offers her hand to Hunter to help him through the memory paintings, except this time he takes it. The parallel to the scene in "Eclipse Lake" is rather obvious.
