One **BIG** team pet, one little one.

The default mascot of The Team and usually the most outlandish of the bunch. Can be a robot, magic animal, or in a more realistic setting, a little girl much younger than everyone else. Often a Sidekick Creature Nuisance.

Most of the time, the Team Pet is comic relief, and their motivations for fighting may seem kinda vague, especially when they are Optional Party Members. If the Team Pet is an otherworldly being, it may end up as an Amusing Alien. It may also be a Pet Monstrosity. In some cases of this, the Team Pet is a unique, "tame," example of a type of creature which the heroes usually fight.

Team Pets do have their other uses, however. We hear lots of stories of dogs pulling people from burning buildings or otherwise saving their lives, for example. Also, the Team Pet can go get help if its master (or someone else on the team) gets in trouble. And a Team Pet can act as an adorable scene partner for a heartfelt Surrogate Soliloquy. It can be a Sealed Evil in a Teddy Bear if it is a Not-So-Harmless Villain once its Restraining Bolt is loosened.

Gratuitous Animal Sidekick is a special category of this, often used in an Animated Adaptation of a live-action show. See also A Boy and His X, Intellectual Animal, Nearly Normal Animal, Talking Animal, and Timmy in a Well. Tagalong Kid is the human equivalent to this, Robot Buddy the artificial version.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Ao no Fuuin_ has Ou eventually join the protagonists, out of curiosity regarding Soko. He's not a very humorous example, more serving as an information base on Oni lore, though his ability of shaking his mane to end up looking like a shaggy dog can lead to some hilarious expressions.
-   In _Bakugan: Battle Planet_, the gang has a French Bulldog tagalong named Lightning.
-   Pitz, Hana's squirrel-like companion from _Captain Earth_.
-   Arthur the cat is probably this for the student council in _Code Geass_. He's used mostly for Running Gags (his tendency to bite Suzaku at every opportunity, his tendency to incite mad chases through the school by stealing important items), but he actually does arguably save Suzaku's life near the end of the first season, when he distracts Black Knight Tamaki, who has Suzaku at gunpoint, by attacking his face.
-   Ein the Welsh corgi from _Cowboy Bebop_. He mostly serves as a vehicle for Animal Reaction Shots, though he does get one notable chance to help the team out near the end of the series.
-   _Darker than Black_ had Mao, a Contractor who had the ability to switch bodies. He lost his human body during an explosion and previously resided in the body of a black cat in the first season before regaining consciousness in the second season and found himself occupying Suou's pet momonga, a flying squirrel. Unlike most Team Pets, Mao (when he was in his cat form) was a useful part of the Syndicate through espionage and diversions. However, when he switches his consciousness to a squirrel, his ability to provide assistance is severely hampered by his small size, demonstrated when an enemy contractor (and a Psycho for Hire) incapacitated him by grabbing his tail and taping him to his car.
-   Timcanpy from _D.Gray-Man_.
-   In _Endride_, Alicia's Warp Relic, Falarion, is a Small Annoying Dragon that is mostly there to look cute and bite things on occasion until the reveal that her missing father's soul is sealed inside it.
-   Menchi/Mince is Excel and Hyatt's Team Pet (and emergency food supply) in _Excel♡Saga_. She knows this, and always fears for her life when her rescuer/master gets those "hungry eyes".
-   Cerberus from _Eyeshield 21_. Although he's not cute and is primarily interested in savaging and eating the Devil Bats. There's also Butaberus, and the little Devil Bat, the actual team mascot, who doesn't physically appear in the story but handles meta explanations, omake and reader questions. There's also Baby Devil Bat, which is just a smaller, student-like version of the Devil Bat.
    -   Word of God reminds us that Cerberus is not a pet. He's a normal person who happens to be a dog. He likes to go for walks, he has his own house, and the only reason he follows Hiruma is because it's an easy way to get food.
-   Happy, a flying cat from _Fairy Tail_ fits better as The Smart Guy, so Plue fits better as Team Pet.
-   Xiao Mei from _Fullmetal Alchemist_, at least for the little Scar party. And Black Hayate for the Mustang people.
-   _Future GPX Cyber Formula_ has V-8 (Asuka's pet dog) to the Sugo Asurada team. In _ZERO_, she gives birth to puppies and in the final episode, those puppies have grown up.
-   Mint in _Genesis Climber MOSPEADA_. Aisha also seems to fill this role after her introduction in Episode 10.
-   Sadaharu from _Gintama_. He is used for poop gags a lot. Also, the yorozuya combined their... powers... to become Sei-chan, the short-lived mascot of the Shinsengumi.
-   In _Guardian Fairy Michel_, Poyo is this for the good guys, while Biam is this for the bad guys.
-   Kameo in _GUN×SWORD_ is Wendy's pet pink turtle, and can usually be found at the end of a chain around Wendy's neck. How it was attached to his shell is never revealed. Van doesn't like him very much.
-   _Hana-Kimi_ has Yūjirō.
-   Printemps, Jeudi's pet cockatoo in _Honoo no Alpen Rose_. And he actually does something useful at one point, when he attacks Mathilda during breakfast because he saw Mathilda trying to poison Jeudi with the tea. He also has important clues regarding \[the Alpen Rose song.
-   Kirara from _Inuyasha_, a two-tailed kitten youkai who can transform into a giant saber-tooth cat when needed.
-   Iggy the Boston Terrier from _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders_. Played straight for the first few seconds of his introduction as he jumps on Polnareff and chews his hair, then subverted when he's shown to be just as strong as the rest of the human members of the group.
-   _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_ has Shigure's pet mouse Tochumaru. It happens to be a competent martial artist.
-   _Kuroko's Basketball_ has Tetsuya #2, a dog. It was adopted by the Seirin High Basketball Club, and named after the main character, Kuroko Tetsuya, for their identical eyes, and expression, or lack thereof.
-   In _Last Period_, The 8th Squad's team pet is a small fuzzy creature called Miu. He is apparently an Art, a type of loot that is sometimes dropped by Spirals when they are defeated. While the team accumulates many additional Arts over the course of their quests, Miu is the only one who normally accompanies them.
-   _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ has Friedrich, Caro's baby dragon who could take a more adult form during battle.
-   Subverted in _Magic Knight Rayearth_, with Mokona, who is treated as nothing more than a useful Team Pet up until the end, where it's revealed that he's actually the creator of both Cephiro and Earth.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam_ has a Team Pet for the entire franchise in Haro, the little spherical robot, who, in the original series, was created by Amuro Ray. Usually a non-combatant, although in some SD Gundam games, a Haro tends to be included as a Lethal Joke Character.
    -   In _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_, there at least _'three_ distinct Haros:
        -   An Orange Haro which co-pilots the Dynames, and by extension Cherudim;
        -   A Blue Haro, which joins the orange one in co-piloting the Zabanya in the movie ;
        -   And Red Haro (the next-most-"important" of the Haros after Orange Haro), awhen it stows away on 0-Raiser, bounces around to beat on the Innovator who stole it, and then takes control to dock with 00. Admit it, NOBODY saw that coming.
-   Tao's parrot, Kokapetl, is the Team Pet in _The Mysterious Cities of Gold_.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Akamaru serves as the team pet for Team 8.
    -   The demonic Statue of the Outer Path serves this for Akatsuki with the Deva Path of Pain due to Nagato treating the Deva Path as a friend, while the statue is vessel of the ten-tails serves to absorb the tailed beasts to revive the Ten-Tails.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ gives us Chamo, the talking ermine. He's also a bit of a mentor, though.
-   Pandaikon from _Nerima Daikon Brothers_.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Subverted and played straight with Chopper the reindeer. Characters often mistakenly assume this is Chopper's role in the crew, and as a result he receives a measly 50 Berry bounty, when his fellow crewmates are all in the tens or hundreds of _millions_. He is, in fact The Medic, and a perfectly capable fighter in his own right.
    -   Bepo of Trafalgar Law's Heart Pirates only has a measly bounty of 500 Berries for exactly the same reason as Chopper: the World Government assumes him to be the pet of the crew.
    -   A straighter example is the whale Laboon, who was Team Pet of the Rumbar Pirates, who eventually had to leave him behind because he couldn't handle the dangers of the Grand Line.
-   In early episodes of _Pokémon: The Series_, Pikachu, when not in battle, was usually found doing something goofy while the human characters were dealing with the situation. This was later dropped with both his and Ash's maturity.
    -   As the series went on, other Pokémon took the role of Team Pet from Pikachu, usually the weakest Pokémon of the female member of the party. Thus, Pikachu was succeeded by Togepi, Torchic, Aipom, Piplup, Happiny, Axew, and finally Dedenne. The Sun and Moon season mixes it up a little, with all of Ash's classmates having their own non-battling "pet" Pokémon.
-   Blair the cat from _Soul Eater_, who has the distinctly unique honor of being the Team Pet _and_ Ms. Fanservice at the same time.
    
    **Soul:** Anyone want the sexy kitty? She's free.
    
-   Shuko, the 1121st owl mascot in _Sound of the Sky_.
-   Ryo-Ohki from _Tenchi Muyo!_ certainly belongs here, when she's not a Cool Starship.
-   Boota is this for _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_.
-   Shiina in the _Vampire Princess Miyu_ TV series is both Miyu's talking pet of sorts and a Shinma with a _very_ powerful eyesight.
-   Karen in _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_. Unlike many other examples, she's not primarily comic relief. Any humor value is derived from the fact a large crocodile is being carried around in someone's backpack. She's also the key part of the link between Jim and Judai, leading Jim to end up sacrificing himself in an attempt to free Judai from Haou. Fittingly, Karen goes down with him.
    -   Pharaoh, the cat belongs to Daitokuji-sensei, the headmaster of the Osiris Red dorm.

    Asian Animation 

-   In the _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_ season _Mighty Little Defenders_, Wolffy gets transformed into a cute dog and he becomes the pet of the goats.

    Comic Books 

-   _Bamse_ has Katten Jansson and Husmusen, a cat and a mouse who really belong to the main character's grandmother but often sneak along on adventures. Some Furry Confusion is involved here, as the cast of the comic are Funny Animals, but Katten Jansson and Husmusen (as well as other pets and wild animals) are portrayed more like Talking Animals who only talk among themselves. Katten Jansson and Husmusen are also usually Those Two Guys when they do not star in the story.
-   In _Cable & Deadpool,_ Bob, Agent of HYDRA, is either Deadpool's Team Pet, best friend, or hostage. No-one is really clear on this, not even Bob or Deadpool. Since Bob's attitude towards Deadpool seems to have moved from fearful to appreciative (if not outright adoring in some places), the last one seems to be discounted. And since his reappearance in _Deadpool_ has him being quite happy to see the merc with a mouth, it's definitely not hostage anymore. The clearest indication that Bob might no longer be considered a hostage is really that he and Deadpool don't appear to have seen each other in some time. During _Cable & Deadpool_, Bob seems quite happy at Agency X, running around on adventures with Deadpool and referring to his capture as a liberation when all the while Deadpool has been trying to get HYDRA to pay a ransom for him (the mention of which doesn't faze Bob in the slightest, suggesting that he realizes that he's still ostensibly being held hostage). To be fair, Deadpool has never been au fait on the distinction between "friendship" and "Stockholm Syndrome". See Weasel, Blind Al, etc.
-   Great Lakes Avengers have Squirrel Girl as their Team Pet, being the youngest, goofiest and least experienced member who has a tail and talks to squirrels. But if you want to get technical, it's really Squirrel Girl's sidekick Tippy-Toe, who's a full member of the group, despite being a squirrel. Yes, that kind of squirrel.
-   Glomulus the Cleaner Slug for the Orange Lantern Corps.
-   _Misfit City_ has Pippin the dog, who goes wherever the girls do.
-   Vincent Van Goat (codenamed HAEDUS) from _Quantum and Woody_ went from a one-shot gag character to an Ensemble Dark Horse.
-   Algy the dog, in _Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman_. He lives at the dairy, and all the milkman get upset if Mr. Crabbe doesn't include him in roll call, which Crabbe finds infuriating.
-   Back in the Silver Age, Superman and Batman both got a Gratuitous Animal Sidekick, Krypto the Superdog and Ace the Bat-Hound respectively... who ended up as part of the "Legion of Super-Pets". Both were retconned out eventually for the obvious reasons, but Krypto has later returned, and so has Ace — in the 90s run as a seeing eye dog Batman inherits from a blind Native American medicine man, and in _Batman Beyond_. Krypto's actually a subversion of sorts as he has all the powers of Superman but little of the human restraint, making him a very dangerous combatant who can fight Superman's foes on even ground.
    -   Batman gets a Great Dane puppy in the New 52 version of _Batman and Robin_ named Titus.
-   Bob the Insecticon is the Autobots' team pet in IDW's _Transformers Ongoing_ comics. Unlike most examples he's actually able to fight and at one point he takes on Ravage and _wins_.
-   Ravage himself gets treated as the team pet by Nautica in _The Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_. She comes from a colony that doesn't have any beast-forms and therefore doesn't realize that he's fully sentient. Since she's a Cuddle Bug and he Hates Being Touched, Hilarity Ensues.
-   X-Men have Lockheed, when Kitty Pryde is on the team, most of the time. Lockheed isn't harmless, though — when roused to fighting fury, he's single-handedly routed Brood hunter packs and utterly annihilated an entire squad of alien Sidri hunters. Both have given respectable fights to experienced X-Men. He can also speak and has actually been spying on the X-Men, albeit benevolently, for quite some time.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Avengers: Infinite Wars_, “Simby”- the alien symbiote more commonly known as Venom in canon- seems to have become an equivalent of this. Since bonding with Spider-Man on Mortis, it has displayed a particular attachment to Peter, as well as his romantic partners Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee, but generally reacts to them more like an animal being affectionate with its masters than a fully sentient being.
-   _Infinity Train: Seeker of Crocus_: Hewie is a Mirage Houndoom Chloe befriends in the Ninjala Car, who becomes Chloe's first step to getting into Pokémon and honorary member of the Red Lotus Uprising.
-   Pablo the duck in _Sister Floriana_, to the Cristo el Rey Monastery.
-   Gull the Chocobo in _The Tainted Grimoire_ is this to Clan Gully.
-   Waspinator on the Decepticon team in _Transformers Meta_.
-   _True Potential_: Hebihiro, Hanabi's snake friend, is this for Team 9.

    Films — Animation 

-   Barbie movies:
    -   Lily and Sparkles from _Barbie & The Diamond Castle_.
    -   _Barbie Spy Squad_ has Percy and Violet, a robot dog and cat pair who help out the agents on their missions.
    -   _Barbie: Star Light Adventure_ has Pupcorn, Barbie's pet space cat.
-   _Little Angels: The Brightest Christmas_: The angel team includes a talking angel dog.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Alien_, Jones the Cat for the crew of the _Nostromo_. External materials say that Dallas had him officially exempted from the company's no-pet policy by registering him as needed for vermin control. However, since most vermin would be killed being outside of shielded cryopods during FTL translation, this was just an excuse to allow him.
-   _The Beastmaster_ has a tiger and an eagle at his command, but he also has his iconic ferrets, Kodo and Podo.
-   _Captain Marvel (2019)_, the heroes find Goose, Carol's late mentor's cat, who tags along for the remainder of the adventure. Humorously, she's the team member that their alien enemies fear the most. Though this is entirely justified, even if the human characters don't realize it at first.
-   In _Clash of the Titans_, Bubo the mechanical owl regularly acted goofy, including flying into things and making crash-landings. However, it also led Perseus to the Stygian Witches, grabbed the Witches' Eye for him, single-handedly freed Pegasus from captivity in Calibos' camp, distracted the Kraken long enough for Perseus to arrive, and carried the bag containing Medusa's head to Perseus, allowing him to petrify the Kraken and save the day.
-   _Dark Star_: Pinback thought the ship needed a mascot. Pinback was wrong.
-   _Hello Down There_: The dolphins Duke and Duchess and seal Gladys frequently visit the house and get along well with the family, with the dolphins having some life-saving moments.
-   _The Hunger Games_: Buttercup to Prim, especially during the rebellion.
-   In _Pacific Rim_, the Australian father-son pilots of Striker Eureka have an adorable English bulldog named Max. He's well loved by almost everyone in the Shatterdome, absolutely adored by Chuck, and serves as the official mascot of Striker Eureka. A decal of Max with a bomb in his mouth can be found on the uniforms of Striker's tech team, the Hansens' drive suits, and the Jaeger itself.
-   In _Rocky Mountain_, Jimmy Wheat carries his little dog Spot along with him for 2,000 miles on a secret mission in California. When they ride off to face the Shoshones, Jimmy leaves Spot with Johanna, but shortly after the men ride away, Spot wriggles free and runs after his friend.

    Literature 

-   _The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi_: Payasam is an abject failure of a ship's cat, incapable of hunting mice or even walking straight while at sea. Nonetheless, everyone but Amina finds it endearing.
-   In the _Circle of Magic_ quartet, the four main characters had their dog Little Bear, which they rescued as a stray puppy in the first book from a couple of boys that were tormenting it. In the later sequel book, _The Will of the Empress_, Little Bear has been left with a new student for company, so Chime, the living glass dragon that belongs to Tris, fills the role as Team Pet for the four.
-   In Stephen King's _The Dark Tower_, one of the protagonists, Jake Chambers, has a pet billy-bumbler named "Oy".
    -   Related to that continuity, Kojak probably counts in _The Stand_. Glen found him, then he was with Glen and Stu until they had to leave him. Later, he makes it to Boulder, goes with the final four to face Flagg, and ends up helping Stu by bringing food until Tom arrives.
-   _Destined to Lead_: Onta, the onti. She often helps Gaorun as a hunting aid, but her main purpose seems to simply exist, hiss and be cute. At times.
-   Subverted at least twice in the _Discworld_ series, once with the Luggage (an Amusing Alien which actually _hates_ its companions and every other life form, aside from its owner and an occasional Love Interest), and again with Quoth the Raven and the Death of Rats, who tend to constitute a Tag-Team Pet between the pair of them.
-   The Famous Five have a dog, Timmy.
-   This is how Rutti sees the fundamentalist Christian he 'adopts' in _The Giddy Death of the Gays and the Strange Demise of Straights_.
-   _Villainous_ example: Nagini from _Harry Potter_, the giant snake who is almost always in the company of her master, Lord Voldemort, and his Death Eaters. Nagini is, however, very dangerous in her own right (being, after all, a huge and very venomous snake), and she's also a living Soul Jar for Voldemort.
    -   For the good guys, Hedwig the owl (and to a lesser extent Hermione's cat Crookshanks) are more ordinary examples.
-   Rick Riordan's _The Heroes of Olympus_:
    -   Festus.
    -   Hannibal the elephant for Camp Jupiter as a whole.
-   _The Hunger Games_: Prim's cat Buttercup, especially during the rebellion.
-   _Invictus_: Saffron, the red panda who lives on the ship. Imogen adores him, Far is annoyed by him.
-   _Malevil_ has Craa, a raven spotted raiding the castle's wheat fields. Though a pest, they name and feed him as he's the only wild animal they've seen since World War III.
-   In _Maximum Ride_, Total becomes the team pet at the end of _Angel Experiment_ and stays on.
-   Desra the mouse in the _Mediochre Q Seth Series_ could be considered this. She doesn't really _do_ much, except hide in Mediochre's coat and occasionally serve as a Chekhov's Gun for her Crazy-Prepared master.
-   Mabob (short for "Thingamabob"), the alien "bird", in the later chapters of _Mirabile_.
-   Bo brings her dog Utah along with her in _Run_ when she and Agnes run away, not wanting to have to leave him with her drug-dealing mother.
-   Andre Norton has the obligatory ship's cat IN SPACE! in her novels about the _Solar Queen_.
-   _Trapped on Draconica_: Specifically Ritchie is Kalak's pet but he's mostly there for comic relief.
-   _The Ultra Violets_ have Darth Odor, a genetically modified, purple skunk.
-   In _Valhalla_, though the walruses are described as a nuisance, they've become one of the series' most recognizable assets, and are half celebrated by the ravine. Umberto in particular is associated with Valknut team, and even the fandom and official blog of the books is called "The Walrus Squad."
-   In _The Witling_, Prince Pelio's pet watchbear Samadhom fills this role once they set off on their journey to the remote island. He becomes even more significant when the three witlings are stuck with only one Talented Azhiri to help them — and he's a Defiant Captive who will kill them all at the first opportunity, since they're helpless against his Psychic Powers. Enter Samadhom, who uses his own Psychic Powers to protect the witlings.

    Live Action TV 

-   _Chicago Fire_: Firehouse 51 started with Pouch ("half Poodle, half couch"), who is later given to a boy whose mother died in the line of duty. With Candidate Darren Ritter comes Tuesday, a Dalmatian with separation anxiety disorder.
-   Classic _Doctor Who_ had K-9, a robot dog who joined the Doctor in the year 5000.
-   _Elementary_: Clyde the tortoise originally belonged to a Conspiracy Theorist who was murdered. Sherlock took Clyde home and occasionally uses him as a paperweight or a fake vehicle when Planning with Props.
-   _Friends_ had the Chick and the Duck. Though aside from Joey and Chandler, who treat the birds like their own children, no one else in the group is particularly fond of them.
-   Season 8 of the rebooted _Hawaii Five-0_ introduces Eddie, a Labrador Retriever whose handler was killed in the line of duty. Steve later adopts him. He also made an appearance in _Magnum, P.I. (2018)_, growling at Juliet, giving her a taste of her own medicine.
-   _Human Target_ has Carmine the Rottweiler.
-   _Imagination Movers_ has Warehouse Mouse, a Team Pet that gets actual plot within the show.

-   _Lost_ has Vincent, the clever Labrador who tends to lead the characters into trouble.
-   _Million Yen Women_: Cat, the kitten taken in by the household.
-   _Person of Interest_: Team Machine has the Belgian Malinois military attack dog Bear. He has an appetite for rare books, bunny slippers and bearer bonds, and (intially at least) only understands commands in Dutch.
-   _Power Rangers_ also had a few of these, including Circuit the robot owl in _Power Rangers Time Force_, RIC the robot dog of _Power Rangers S.P.D._, and Fire Heart the dragon in _Power Rangers Mystic Force_ (Technically _Power Rangers Ninja Storm_ had a gerbil, but that was their transformed sensei rather than an actual 'pet').
-   In _Primeval_ we get Rex, a _Coelurosauravus_ (sorta of a prehistoric gliding lizard) from the Permian anomaly. He doesn't serve much purpose, except to hang out and look cute, possibly to counter all of the Nightmare Fuel.
    -   In the later seasons we also meet Sid and Nancy, a pair of mischievous _Diictodon_ (think reptilian gopher with beak and tusks) who were kept by Connor after their home anomaly closed. Despite being less important as characters, they seem to serve more purpose, as in one episode Sid escapes into the ARC and becomes trapped in a lab containing the Future Fungus, leading Connor to have to retrieve him and nearly freezing to death in the process.
-   In _Star Trek: Discovery_, Cleveland Booker's cat Grudge is fast becoming one of these.
-   Super Sentai has a few of these, most notably IC the cyborg dog from _Denshi Sentai Denziman_ who dies by using himself as a power circuit for the Humongous Mecha, but gives the team one final Tear Jerker message.
    -   An equally notable one is DaiGoyo from _Samurai Sentai Shinkenger_. Made from a paper lamp, he is a sentient Large Ham that can not only shoot disks (for training or attacking) but can grow to mecha-size and fight alongside the Origamis in battle.
-   _Top Gear_ Dog, a Labradoodle bitch belonging to Richard Hammond who occasionally features on the show. Since she throws up whenever she gets in a car (which they discovered after taking her on a caravan holiday) her job is mainly to get in the way and sleep on the studio floor.
    -   And to not help herd sheep.
-   _Torchwood_ has Myfanwy the pterodactyl.
-   _Ultra Series_:
    -   _Ultraman Dyna_ has Hanejiro, a small furry alien that Super GUTS first encounters when on a mission to an alien planet.
    -   Coco from _Ultraman Max_ is a Robot Buddy that speaks in beeps and whistles. It's almost always accompanying DASH's more full-fledged robot member, Elly.
    -   _Ultraman Mebius_ has Rimu Eleking, a chibi version of the iconic Ultra Monster Eleking that appears from time to time due to a problem in GUYS' Maquette Monster creator.

-   Sublime had Louie Dog, the beloved Dalmatian of the late Bradley Nowell, who frequently joined the band on stage.
-   In Phase One, _Gorillaz_ had Mix Monkey on turntable.

    Podcasts 

-   _Fallout Is Dragons_ has Craggy the baby Cragodile, who mostly chews on things.
-   Each Player Character in _Trials & Trebuchets_ eventually gets an animal companion: Winsler starts out with his cat familiar Mr. Wiggles, Mira finds the paper crow Crowrigami in the Portal Book, Serinepth gets the amethyst hedgehog Virgil from the plane of Isathil, and Integrity gets the plush nine-tailed squirrel she won in Patter magically animated to become her living plush squirrel Ida.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   CHIKARA 2010-2011: Delirious was this for Die Bruderschaft des Kreuzes, since Ares led him around on a chain and even referred to Delirious this way. He served as a Right-Hand Attack Dog, since, when Ares and Claudio Castagnoli were defending the CHIKARA Campeonatos de Parejas, Delirious would attack their opponents before the matches, leading to the BDK winning the first fall in around 5 seconds or so.
-   In Stardom, Oedo Tai's Act Yasukawa would lead Holidead around on a chain. She came off as a Wrestling Monster, towering over her opponents and generally seeming crazy and uncontrollable.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_: All Bretonnian mercenaries are considered shepherds for legal reasons, since peasants are technically not allowed to travel without their lords' permission, and may be questioned harshly or killed if they show up in places they aren't supposed to go, but shepherds traditionally have far more leeway in these matters. Mercenary bands usually have one sheep to provide the necessary legal fig leaf, and these sheep often become pampered mascots.

    Video Games 

-   Boo in both the _Baldur's Gate_ games was something of a pet if Minsc was in your group, though he was little more than an annoyance to many players as he took up a valuable quick item slot.
    -   In _Megatokyo_, a hamster is named Boo in honour of Minsc's pet.
-   Meemai in the first _Baten Kaitos_ game isn't a party member — she's a little seal-like creature that rides in the neck of Xelha's shirt. And is used in several of her super moves.
    -   And happens to be the mind of the fragmented Whale, ancient god of the Lost Ocean
-   In _Chrono Cross_, the first party member you can recruit in the game is Poshul, a pink, unnervingly cutesy talking dog.
    
    **Poshul:** Me will use my Pretty-Miracle-Power-X! Me will do it, Thergiepoo!
    
-   _Dragon Age: Origins_ has a Mabari Hound that the player names themselves. All the characters that join you like the dog, even the less pleasant characters like Morrigan, Sten or Loghain.
    -   OTOH, Oghren seems to dislike him (becomes more obvious when he's drunk). Alistair, of all people, also has a knack for pissing off Dog. Getting too close to his food, teasing him about eating human flesh, etc. At one point, the Grey Warden can remind him that Dog is a _warhound_ and not a puppy to be teased. The "dialogue" Alistair has with Dog also doesn't seem terribly friendly either.
        -   Oghren's just annoyed that Dog doesn't agree that his wearing a saddle and serving as Oghren's (a dwarf's) personal cavalry mount is a good idea.
    -   The _entire_ Mabari breed are the Team Pet of Ferelden. _Dragon Age II_ reveals that other nations refer to Fereldans as "_The Dog-Lords_".
        -   And Dragon Age Inquisition gives us a codex entry about a Fereldan song (Andraste's Mabari) that says Andraste, the holy prophet, must have a Mabari too according to them, for "all Ferelden knows it right".
-   _Dragon Quest V_'s Borongo/Saber is a sabrecat served as The Hero and Bianca's Team Pet. Though in the later of the game, Borongo has no more importance to the plot, and you can develop your own army of monster Team Pet.
    -   _Dragon Quest VIII_ has Munchie, The Hero's rat pet that is very smart. It can be used to clear curtain puzzles in a dungeon. It turns out very latter that Munchie is The Hero's ancestor in disguise.
-   Ricky the monkey from _Dubloon_.
-   _Epic Battle Fantasy_: In the Flash web browser game series, your team has Nolegs the Cat.
    -   _Epic Battle Fantasy 3_: He occasionally gives a random team member a random item. Sadly, Nolegs fits into the worthless pet category as it is rarely the item you need nor the team member who needs it.
    -   _Epic Battle Fantasy 5_: He's a full member of the party.
-   Dogmeat is often potrayed like this in _Fallout 4_ fanworks, due to being the only animal in the Sole Survivor's roster of companions.
-   _Fate/Grand Order_ has Fou, a white, fluffy, dog-like thing. He's occasionally referred to as a Cath Palug. Near the end of the story, there's a few bombs dropped regarding exactly _what_ Fou is: he's Merlin's familiar, sent across time to act as Merlin's spy on Chaldea so he can keep himself up-to-date on the situation... and moreover, he's a younger form of _Primate Murder_, aka Beast IV, the most ruthlessly efficient human killing machine in existence. Fortunately, as Fou, he's learned to like humans and has no desire to go on murder sprees.
-   Mog, and to a lesser extent Relm, in _Final Fantasy VI_ (although the team has an actual pet in Interceptor, Shadow's canine partner).
-   Cait Sith in _Final Fantasy VII_ (Fits more than one stereotype, as the character is actually a robot cat working for the bad guys.)
-   Sazh's Chocobo chick in _Final Fantasy XIII_.
-   _Fire Emblem Engage_ has Sommie, a small, dog-like creature. They are said to be the guardian spirit of the Somniel, and have been guarding it since time immemorial. As the player's Virtual Pet, Sommie is particularly close to Alear. Although Sommie doesn't help out too much in combat, they can assist Alear in mini games, and give the player bond fragments.
-   Swiss-Army Weapon Jack in _Gears of War_.
-   _Jet Force Gemini_ has Lupus, an alien dog-like creature who has jet thrusters on his paws, which he uses to hover, and a gun turret on his back that is replaced with the weapon the player selects somehow.
-   Similarly to R2-D2 in the movie example, T3-M4 from _Knights of the Old Republic_ is essentially a very useful team pet.
-   In the _Learning Voyage_ games, there's a purple alien named Blip who accompanies the Discovercraft Crew on their adventures. He says nothing, simply flying around, pointing things out, and occasionally face-palming at a bad joke.
-   Pochi, the family's pet monster from _Legacy of the Wizard_.
-   Nall and Ruby of the _Lunar_ series. They both look like adorable winged kittens, but are actually baby dragons.
-   _Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis_ gives us Muppy, a **slug-like alien** floating in a pot-shaped UFO. No one except Nikki can see that he was actually an _alien invader_. The Smart Guy/The Rival thinks he's _handicapped_, and the principal who admitted him to the school? _Transfer student_ from "Waii'ha". Everyone else? Hoo-boy...
    -   And, apart from being the McGuffin at the end of one chapter, he doesn't have any impact on the story at all. And, the best that the main character can get out of his Relationship Values with Muppy? _A pinky swear_. No, really.
-   In _Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain_, Snake and the Diamond Dogs have DD, a wolf-like dog that the player can take on missions and can be very useful especially with later upgrades.
-   The Nintendo Switch version of _Miitopia_ gives players a nameable horse that tags along with the main party, essentially making them this. The horse can even be customized, just like the Miis themselves. Although they aren't _too_ useful in combat, they will occasionally help the party and provide powerful attacks. The Hero can even use the horse to perform a Limit Break attack.
-   In _Mother 3_, one of the party members is the main character's dog, Boney, who is also the only character besides main character Lucas to appear in every chapter.
    -   Used to a lesser extent in _EarthBound (1994)_, where Ness's dog King and a gum-chewing monkey both join your party for parts of the game.
-   _Persona_:
    -   Koromaru from _Persona 3_: A highly intelligent dog (based on Hachikō) who can summon the spirit of Cerberus to strike your foes with fire and darkness. And invoke hilariousness when he refuses to eat Yukari's cooking. He's also the one who saves the team when Ikutsuki tries to force Aigis to kill them.
    -   From _Persona 4_, there's Teddie, a life-sized _teddy bear_ from the TV World who serves as your initial guide before joining your party for real. He later takes a _human_ form when in the real world, and a _Bishōnen_ at that. The shrine fox is a downplayed example; it's not part of the Investigation Team, but it does follow them into the TV World in order to sell them healing leaves.
    -   _Persona 5_ continues the trend with Morgana, a talking cat who takes on a cartoony appearance in the world of the Palace, but looks like a mostly normal feline in the real world. Between his Persona powers, knowledge of the Palace, and ability to transform into a van, he proves to be an essential part of the team.
-   Cupil from _Skies of Arcadia_ fills this role, but doubles as Fina's weapon. To a lesser extent, the "Jester" Pow, who's Vyse's huskra.
-   Myau from the first _Phantasy Star_ game is a Musk Cat, a race of intelligent feline creatures capable of human speech. He can also cast healing and buffing techniques, making him a great asset in Alis' quest to defeat Lassic.
-   The _Scooby-Doo_ video game _Scooby-Doo, Who's Watching Who?_ has Mystery, Inc. compete with a rival team of paranormal sleuths on a reality show called _Ghost Scene Investigation_. The Ghost Scene Investigation team had a counterpart for Scooby-Doo in a robot cat named Catscan.
-   Team Pets are common in the _Tales Series_:
    -   Quickie, Meredy's pet, in _Tales of Eternia_. He can attacks enemies on his own, even when Meredy chants a spell.
    -   _Tales of Symphonia_ has two: Noishe, Lloyd's Arshis companion, and Corrine, Sheena's manmade Summon Spirit. The latter even makes a Heroic Sacrifice to save Sheena from Volt. The former is… a complex case. Lloyd calls him a dog, but he's actually a Protozoan, the first creature to have been born on the planet. He evolves during the course of its own life, starting off as a single-celled organism, then a fish, then a bird, then the dog-like form, then 'another' form, then finally a human that fights evil.
    -   _Tales of Rebirth_ has Zapie, Claire's pet. He plays a minor part in story, mainly by sensing Claire's presence.
    -   _Tales of Legendia_ has Giet, Moses's pet Galf (a wolf-like creature). The Oresoren also fill the part of mascot characters, but they're their own intelligent race.
    -   _Tales of the Abyss_ has Mieu, a young cheagle, who serves Luke as part of his punishment for accidentally setting forest on fire, forcing dangerous monster to flee to Cheagle Forest. As result, heroes are forced to kill said monster, only for next antagonist to reveal that she was raised by this very monster. And now she tries to avenge it.
    -   Coda in _Tales of Innocence_. He's a rat- or monkey-like creature, who does nothing but talks about how hungry he is. R version makes up for it somewhat, by making him a Butt-Monkey.
    -   _Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World_ features Tenebrae, a millennia-old Centurion, who would like to assert tahat he's _not_ a dog. Colette and Presea seems to disagree.
    -   Repede in _Tales of Vesperia_ is… a dog. That fights with a knife in teeth, but still a dog. Gameplay-wise he's a Fragile Speedster.
    -   Teepo in _Tales of Xillia_. He's a living doll who Elize views as her best friend, and assists her in battle by attacking enemies or boosting her magic ability. He sometimes greets people by biting their faces (Except for Milla, for whom he chooses to invoke something else), and just does it for the heck of it, as well. However, he actually has no personality of his own, and is simply voicing Elize's thoughts.
    -   Ludger's cat, Rollo, takes over this role to a degree in _Tales of Xillia 2_. When he meets Teepo, they get a skit relating to this fact.
    -   The Normin in _Tales of Zestiria_ and _Tales of Berseria_ are this, with Bienfu playing this trope straighter along with being The Mole (involuntarily) in the latter game.
    -   _Tales of Arise_ has Hootle, Rinwell's pet owl, that rides around in her hood.
    -   Mobile games likewise has several:
        -   _Tales of Link_ has Lippy, fairy Mentor Mascot of indeterminate gender<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  that fights with a smartphon. Smartphon stands for "Sacred Magic ARTifact PHONophototabulus", by the way.
        -   _Tales Of The Rays_ has Karia and Kocis, Mileena's and Ix's mirrites respectively. Kocis later grows out of this trope, literally.
        -   _Tales of Crestoria_ has Meakyu, a "phantom creature" that can store Mana in its body.
-   Hans in _Valkyria Chronicles_, a (vestigially) winged pig. Exists mostly to look embarrassed when the protagonist flubs romantic moments in cut scenes.
-   The _Wild AR Ms_ series had a number of these.
    -   _Wild AR Ms 1_: Both the heroes and the villains have one. The Dream Chasers/Wanderers have Hanpan, a pale blue Wind Mouse. The Quarter Knights have Luceid, a wolf and the Guardian of Desire.
    -   _Wild AR Ms 2_ has Pooka as the Team Pet.
    -   _Wild AR Ms 3_ gives one to the Shroedinger family, a claustrophic cat named Shady.
    -   _Wild AR Ms XF_ has a large dog named Tony. Who is implied to be Lucied.
-   _The Walking Dead: Season Four_: Rosie, the pitbull that lives in the Ericson's Boarding School. Rosie used to be the headmaster's pet, but was left behind, along with the kids, when the adult workers of the school skipped town at the start of the Zombie Apocalypse. Now, Rosie is a loyal protector of the kids and Marlon's pet. She can potentially become Clementine's pet too.
-   ChuChu in _Xenogears_. There's a scene late in the game where your party gets captured by Krelian and used as bait to draw Elly out. The Big Bad has the party's Gears crucified in a field, which is meant to be somber and reflect on their possible fate. But if you have ChuChu in your party, that giant plush toy will be up there with the crucified giant robots, turning "Chu-Chu died for your sins!" into a meme among Xenogears fans.
-   MOMO in _Xenosaga_.
-   _Yuuyami Doori Tankentai_ has Meros, Nao's dog, who helps the kids investigate the Urban Legends around Hirumi City.

    Web Animation 

-   _Camp Camp_: The Platypus, but only in a nominal sense. It was adopted as a living mascot in the second episode, but generally acts as a Living Prop for most of the series. Due to his venom, almost no one at Camp Campbell really wants to get near it so they let it as it pleases.
-   _La Golda_ has Choomi, a dog La Golda met after getting off the bus to Ms. Ricca's orphanage.
-   _Minecraft Endventures_: Porky, Colin's pet Battlepig.
-   Tucker's alien baby 'Junior' briefly serves as this for Blue Team in Season 5 of _Red vs. Blue_.
-   _RWBY_: During Volume 2, Yang and Ruby's father sends them a parcel. The accompanying letter tells them that he's going on a mission so they have to look after the family pet. The parcel is a corgi called Zwei. The dog becomes the team pet for the duration of the volume, accompanying them on their student mission to Mountain Glenn to fight the Grimm and investigate White Fang activity. The dog is strongly implied to be intelligent enough to understand human speech. He is also able to team up with Doctor Oobleck to transform into a flaming projectile that can help fight the enemy.

    Webcomics 

-   _Adventurers!_ has Chookie, some sort of Smurfing pink thing. Karn has a... violent reaction during their first encounter, but he's shown to be part of the party later anyway.
-   A puppy named Pavlov in _Dr. Frost_ is this to the psychologists in the counseling center at Yonggang University.
-   In this _El Goonish Shive_ Guest Strip, Jeremy, the cat with hedgehog spines, seems to fulfill this role.
-   The May 28, 2004 strip of _Exterminatus Now_ sees Virus bring a Chao to the team, lampshading its role in the process, which is soon followed with a discussion on what to name it. Seven strips after its introduction, it meets a demon, undergoes a radical transformation, and becomes a bite-sized killing machine. In the following strip, it is christened "Blasphemy."
-   _Fontes' Rants_: Tanooki.
-   You'd think Krosp the uplifted cat from _Girl Genius_ would be one of these, but he's really more of a character in his own right. The tiny robot Agatha built early on in the comic's run, Dingbot Prime, fits the mold better.
-   Snookums the tentacle bunny in _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_, although he's mainly Molly's pet. It's notable that Molly herself started out as Bob's pet, before she turned out to be sentient and grew to human size.
-   In _Little Robot, Big Scary World_, the beetle, named Go-Ship, acts as BIP's pet. BIP himself counts for the human crew, who regard him as their adorable, clumsy mascot.
-   Pickles the Dog, from _M9 Girls!_, becomes the team mascot after Clau "rescues" him from piloting a giant robot.
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   Mr. Scruffy the cat becomes the Team Pet once adopted by Belkar.
    -   Blackwing, Vaarsuvius's raven familiar, occupied the role before, but he's more of an Intellectual Animal, and now a full character in his own right.
-   Parodied in the hiatused webcomic _RPG World_ by the character Dragobo, a portmaneau character based on a dragon and a chocobo.
-   _The Shufflers_ has Governor Mumpkins, an adorable cat that follows Märchen and Hiddenite in their adventures.
-   In _Sluggy Freelance_, the non-human members of the main cast (Bun-Bun, Kiki, and Aylee) tend to fill this role, each in varying degrees (though not so much Aylee now that she's taken a mostly human form).
    -   Bun-Bun is actually a parody of this trope as he was specifically bought by Torg so the strip could have a cute animal... said cute animal is a murderous criminal that can take care of himself and seemingly only hangs around Torg for free food and lodging and whom orginially Torg wanted dead and/or gone (although it IS later revealed he has grown to actually really care about the main cast much later in the strip and fairly early on Torg was shown to clearly miss Bun-Bun when he was AWOL for a while). Kiki on the other hand plays this trope very straight.
-   Davan's hairless, amorphous cat Choo-Choo Bear in _Something\*Positive_, odd for an otherwise (usually) non-fantastic Life Embellished Webcomic. Sometimes seen seeping out of box, popping out of a toaster or acting as Davan's scarf or somesuch. He's a piece of the comic's Early-Installment Weirdness that's actually remained while most every other bit has long since vanished.
-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_: In that universe, cats are used as defense tool against Plague Zombie monsters, but the crew initially didn't have one due to Cutting Corners from Mission Control (unless one counts the scout that acts a lot like one). They eventually adopt a feral kitten during the mission, which means that it can only do the basics compared to a properly trained adult and spends the rest of the time being a Cute Kitten.
-   Parodied in _Those Destined,_ where the Team Pet is also the party thief. Another adventurers party was less lucky, and their Team Pet is a Sidekick Creature Nuisance.
-   In _Unsounded_, Boo is a whimsical, curious ghost inhabiting a Magitek spider pymaric. Sette and Duane's company teaches it quite a few new tricks and coaxes out some pretty impressive hidden depths.

    Web Original 

-   _Deviant_: Draconian, a dragon-like hybrid, serves as this for superhero team Terminus, acting like a giant puppy. That said, he still breathes fire and eats people, so he's just as scary as the rest of them.
-   Bozo the dog from _The Jenkinsverse_ is the team pet of the SOR. Like the HEAT Operators themselves he is an absolutely enormous specimen for his species.
-   _Whateley Universe_: Multiple:
    -   For Team Kimba, Tennyo's stuffed cabbit, which is animated anytime Generator wants. It Makes Sense in Context. While cute and silly and usually played for laughs, the cabbit can alert Generator instanteously, and in "Christmas Crisis" demonstrated that it can be _horrifically_ effective.
    -   The Loose Cannons have Sparky, a very intelligent dog they rescued from UNITY.

    Web Videos 

-   _Belkinus Necrohunt_: During the events in Chester City, Enoch uses his inventing talents to create a mechanical Corgi he names Kuro, who can assist with supersonic barks and dispensing healing pills. The rest of the party immediately takes a shine to Kuro when they regroup.
-   _Critical Role_ has got several examples.
    -   In the first campaign, Vox Machina has Trinket the bear, who is Vex'ahlia's Animal Companion as per the class feature for the Beast Master Ranger. Early on, Tiberius also adopts a sickly pseudodragon in Vasselheim, which he names Lockheed, but Lockheed leaves the group and returns to Draconia with his owner in Episode 29. Lockheed returns in Episode 64 in a sort of proxy Back for the Dead, as Vox Machina finds him, shivering and malnourished, in the ruins of Draconia shortly before discovering Tiberius's body.
    -   The second campaign instead has Frumpkin, Caleb's familiar, who usually manifests in the form of a cat but can also take other forms as required. So far, he's been several types of bird for aerial scouting, and an octopus for underwater missions. On the road to Nicodranas, the Mighty Nein encountered a travelling merchant selling exotic pets, and the encounter resulted in Jester buying a Scarlet Weasel, which she named Sprinkle, and a Blink Dog puppy which she named Nugget, and Beauregard bought an owl which she named Professor Thaddeus. By the end of the Nicodranas arc, Professor Thaddeus flew away, never to be seen again, and Nugget was left behind with Jester's mother, leaving the party with just Frumpkin and Sprinkle.
-   Fussy Britches to the _D 20 Live_ 2014 campaign (and subsequently _D20 Live_ in general).
-   _Easy Allies_: Jones's dog, Sophie.
-   _PlayStation Access_: Delsin Rodent is a badger puppet, who doesn't talk other than whispering in Rob's ear.

    Western Animation 

-   The parody series _The Adventures of Mr. Incredible_ had Mr. Skipperdoo, a mostly useless, bespectacled rabbit.
-   Chuchu, the family dog on _The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan_.
-   _Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!_ has F.T. (Fuzzy Tomato) a mix between tomato and dog, also part of the Token Enemy Minority.
-   Momo in _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ is a flying bat-like lemur. In contrast, Appa is a 10-ton flying bison who has been subject to serious personalized stories and has a strong century-long bond with the titular character, making him more of a life-long companion than a Team Pet. Momo's presence or absence is a firm indicator to how light-hearted and whimsical or serious and edgy the current story is. Co-creator Bryan Konietzko has admitted that he based him on his childhood cat Buddy.
-   _Bubble Guppies_ has one in the form of Bubble Puppy.
-   Elvis from _Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids_, whose major plot purpose is to cause Mr. Socrates to sneeze.
-   The Bean Team of _Butterbean's Cafe_ has a winged cat named Cookie who mostly hangs with the youngest of the group, Cricket.
-   _The Chocolix_: Sweetcookie, Chocolyne and Chocomark's pet dog, serves as one for their team. She helps them on occasion when they're in trouble, such as in "The Blue Chocolate Lake" when Chocolyne, Chocmark, and their friend Max are too melted to move, and in "The Chocobeard Treasure" when they get trapped in a cave.
-   Kiwi, Odd's pet dog in _Code Lyoko_, fits the role, although he's not very often involved in the Five-Man Band's adventures.
-   Faffy from _Dave the Barbarian_ is a spoof of these type of creatures.
    -   To a lesser extent, Twinkle The Marvel Horse.
-   _Defenders of the Earth_ includes two Team Pets. Kisa is a black panther which Jedda has raised from a cub. Zuffy is a zuffoid, a small bipedal creature native to the planet Mongo; he becomes Kshin's constant companion.
    -   Ming's giant serpent, Mongor, is a villainous example of the same trope.
-   _The Dragon Prince_: Bait and Stella for the Dragang, Sir Sparklepuff for the villains.
-   Uni the baby unicorn from the _Dungeons & Dragons (1983)_ cartoon.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_ has Timmy's fairy dog Sparky.
-   In _Futurama_ Nibbler is the Team Pet, even if he is an Amusing Alien and Intellectual Animal. However, in the Season 6 episode "That Darn Katz!", he gets promoted to full-fledged member of the Planet Express crew. The characters still treat him as a pet though because he enjoys it.
-   Bronx in _Gargoyles_ is the pet of the gargoyle team, and their equivalent of a dog.
-   _Glitch Techs_: In the third episode, Miko gets Ally, a Chocobo\-like creature that she and Five refused to debug. In episode eight, Five gets his own companion in the form of a mech named Alpha, who originates from the same game.
-   It would really be a disservice to call Godzilla a team pet in _Godzilla: The Series_; the crew prefer "The Big Guy". They have N.I.G.E.L for that.
    -   The earlier _The Godzilla Power Hour_, on the other hand, had Godzooky.
-   _Gravity Falls_: Gompers the goat is this for the Mystery Shack throughout the whole series. To an even greater extent, Waddles the pig becomes this starting in the ninth episode, "The Time-Traveler's Pig", when Mabel wins him in a carnival.
-   Hanna-Barbera _loves_ this trope to pieces. For instance:
    -   Bandit in ANY incarnation of _Jonny Quest_. He regularly provides comic relief, as well as getting the team into trouble (and out again) and going for help.
    -   Sebastian is Alexandra's smartass cat on _Josie and the Pussycats_, but he'll usually pitch in to help the others when needed.
    -   Elmo, Augie's bulldog on _The Funky Phantom_, is usually engaged in a battle of wits with Mudsy's cat Boo.
    -   Braveheart, the misnamed St. Bernard on _Inch High, Private Eye._
    -   Mr. Cool, Fonzie's dog in _The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang_.
    -   _Clue Club_ has two sentient examples: Woofer (a vainglorious bloodhound) and Wimper (a basset).
    -   _Space Ghost_. Space Ghost, Jan and Jace had a highly intelligent monkey named Blip as their mascot. Blip would regularly help defeat the villains by pulling tricks on them and distracting them. He also sometimes messed up in an amusing manner at the end of an episode.
-   _Hero: 108_: While the Green Turtle in its entirety has many animal representatives (most of which are reformed villains), both First Squad and Second Squad are mostly formed of humans safe for an animal member - Jumpy Ghostface, the Rabbit King, in the former, and the Liger King in the latter.
-   Wamba in _Ivanhoe: The King's Knight_ is viewed as such by Harold despite Wamba being a human being of the Saxon ancestry like Harold. Maybe it has to do with Wamba being a jester?
-   _Kid Cosmic_: Tuna Sandwich serves as Kid's and the whole team's pet, as well as a member of them who uses his ring's powers to warn them of danger ahead of time.
-   In _Kim Possible_, Ron Stoppable’s naked mole rat Rufus. He’s also quite intelligent, as he occasionally speaks, sabotages whatever traps Kim and Ron get into, and even builds some gadgets and gizmos from time to time.
-   _Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts_ has Mandu, the team's Mute Pet Pig who is unable to talk but is usually able to detect malicious intentions.
-   In the Sequel Series, _The Legend of Korra_, the two team pets tradition continues with Pabu, the fire ferret (red panda/ferret hybrid) and Korra's polarbear-dog, Naga. Naga can't fly, but she's at least as dangerous in combat as Appa was.
-   _Middlemost Post_: Russell, the walrus. She cannot speak, but that doesn't prevent her from joining in the fun.
-   _Molly of Denali_: Suki, Molly's Alaskan Malamute, has an uncanny ability to find things and serves as a mascot for Molly's family and friend circle.
-   R.O.T.H. in _Motorcity_, who's a Cute Machine / Robot Buddy. He makes these shrill, quiet shrieking noises instead of talking.
-   The title creature of _My Pet Monster_ is this for Max and his friends.
-   Kuma in _Pole Position_.
-   Slimer in _The Real Ghostbusters_ and _Extreme Ghostbusters_. Also in _Ghostbusters: The Video Game_, but since it's based purely on the film continuity, _there_ he's an incorrigible mischievous glutton who has to be kept in a terrarium so he won't wreak comedic and comparatively harmless havoc — one of the first major tasks in the game is to recapture him after he escapes.
-   _Ready Jet Go!_: Sunspot, being the only animal in the main cast, fills in this role, and also serves a mascot of sorts for the group.
-   Scooby-Doo is the team pet of mystery-solving teenage sleuths Mystery, Inc. with the slight twist that he's also the protagonist.
-   _The Secret Saturdays_: Zak has three Team Pets, all of them cryptids, including a 7-foot tall "gorilla-cat" named Fisk, a komodo dragon (named, you guessed it, Komodo), and a pterosaur named Zon. Unlike most team pets, Zak treats them like their part of his family, including Fisk, whom he likens to an adopted brother
-   Tally-Hawk is the _SilverHawks_' mascot.
-   Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II in _The Simpsons_. The former is generally more useful.
-   _The Smurfs_ adopted a dog named Puppy in the latter seasons.
-   _Steven Universe_:
    -   Steven has his magical pink pet lion... Lion. He is mostly comic relief, but has hidden abilities which are slowly revealed through the series.
    -   Steven later brings a pumpkin to life to give to Lapis and Peridot as a pet. The pumpkin is, of course, named Pumpkin.
    -   In the episode "Pool Hopping", Garnet adopts a stray kitten that she names Cat Steven.
-   Radarr is just another element of the Cliché Storm that is _Storm Hawks_. Pun unintended.
-   _The Strange Chores_ has Snorp, a green dog-like creature who's Helsing's pet.
-   Both _Teen Titans_ and _Teen Titans Go!_ have Silkie, the mutant silkworm.
-   Snarf from _Thunder Cats_ is pretty well the epitome of this trope. Utterly useless in a fight except against the weakest of minions, and tends to serve as weak comedy relief. Subverted only slightly in that Snarf is actually the nanny for Lion-O before he wakes up all growed-up on Third Earth. Occasionally subverted — but those occasions also meant that Cats who should have _known better_ didn't.
-   In _Thunder Cats 2011_ Snarf is much more explicitly a _pet_: Though possessing Amplified Animal Aptitude, Snarf cannot speak, and instead serves as an Empathy Pet and The Confidant for Lion-O's many Surrogate Soliloquys. Also an Evil-Detecting Dog... not that Kid Hero Lion-O pays enough attention when Snarf tries to serve in that capacity.
-   Inverted in _Transformers_, where the main characters are robots, and the team 'pet' is usually a human.
    -   Spike and Daniel are the most blatant examples. Apparently, this trope is genetic.
    -   In _Transformers: Animated_, Sari is a debatable example for her first two seasons, then gets upgraded to Sixth Ranger after her Robotic Reveal.
    -   In _Transformers: Super-God Masterforce_, Cab's parrot and armadillo are definite examples.
    -   In _Transformers: Prime_, most of the team gets their own _individual_ pet. Bulkhead has Miko, Arcee has Jack, and Bumblebee has Rafael, and Optimus has a feral-cat-that-you-sometimes-leave-food-outside-for relationship with Agent Fowler. When Wheeljack arrives, Miko comments that "he'll need his own \[pet\] human".
-   _Voltron: Legendary Defender_ has a few. First and most obvious, the Lions, though they aren't actually animals. Then there's the space mice from Altea. In "Space Mall", Pidge and Lance got a free Earth cow named Kaltenecker with their video game. Finally, the cosmic wolf with the ability to teleport that Krolia and Keith adopted during their two years traveling through the Quantum Abyss.
-   Az the Tofu, a Ridiculously Cute Critter from _Wakfu_.
-   The _Winx Club_ has Kiko the bunny. In Season 1, the Trix had Pepe the duck, but he disappeared after Season 1.
-   _Young Justice_ has both Sphere the supercycle and Wolf the um, wolf. They both help in missions.
