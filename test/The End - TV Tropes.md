_"The end of THE END can be found at the end of THE END."_

— **Lemony Snicket**, explaining where to find the last pages of the book fittingly entitled _The End._

The story's over. Time to put up an intertitle card saying "THE END". If you really want to be sophisticated, write it in cursive. The words "You Have Been Watching" followed by the ending credits was popular in Live-Action Television for a while, particularly but not exclusively in Sitcoms.

Most movies in past years have used this as the standard end to the story, but now it is used off and on, at the whim of the writers. When films only had opening credits, this was a way to indicate the end of the film. Now that opening credits are shortened (or absent) and the full credits come at the end of the film, this isn't as useful.

In some cases the show will end on a sad note, but the next moment is a flowery card stating "The End", accompanied by a bright fanfare. It is common to play this for laughs.

The French translation, "FIN", is often used with Le Film Artistique or if the filmmakers want an aquatic pun. For frustrating endings, there's always the Italian translation "FINE".

The video game variant, seen in quite a few Fighting Game examples, is to show the usual "Game Over" screen after the ending and credits. This time it's not because you failed, it's just because... well, the game is over. Sometimes the phrase "Thank you for playing" is added. If you're unlucky, that will be the entire ending.

Compare That's All, Folks!, and contrast To Be Continued. See also Interrupted by the End.

There are two video games called _The End_: the one from 2012 can be found here, while the one from 2015 can be found here. Similarly, the webcomic by that name can be found here.

## Interesting variations of this trope:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Subverted in _Cromartie High School_. One sketch ends with the caption "The End... of the introduction" and the episode keeps on going.
-   The final episode of _Dragon Ball GT_ had "The End" at the end of it.
-   The last episode of _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ has a card with runes on it that has the japanese word "Oshimai" which could either translate to "Fin" or "Concludes." Notably it also says "Puella Magi Madoka Magica" under that but "Magica" is spelled with a "k" instead of a "c."
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_'s conclusive theatrical film was actually titled, _The End of Evangelion_. And it proved to be so, up until a full-blown restart of the series ten years later.
-   At the end of the credits of the final episode of _Sailor Moon_, Usagi says "Oshimai...", with the rest of the Inner Guardians finishing with "...dayo!" (meaning, "It's the end!") as said text appeared onscreen. The Viz dub has Usagi/Sailor Moon say "The end!", followed by the Inner Guardians saying "See ya!"
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ uses this when concluding each part. Most parts use "完," the Japanese kanji equivalent of this trope, but _Golden Wind_ uses "fine," the Italian word for "end."

    Comic Books 

-   The last panel of _Tintin: The Castafiore Emerald_ has the parrot Iago (no, not _that_ Iago) saying, "Blistering barnacles, that's the end!"

    Fan Works 

-   The _Turnabout Storm_ novelization ends with the word "Finis", French for "finished".
-   The last panel of a _My Little Pony: Rock Is Magic_ comic always says, "This is the end, my only friend, the end."

    Eastern Animation 

-   Very common in Soviet and Eastern European animated shorts; the Russian word is _Koniets_, in Polish _Koniec_ and so on. Latvian examples have been seen on internet sites teaching the language using interactive Flash animations; the word here is _Beigas_.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Thief and the Cobbler_: the Thief steals the letters from the end title.
-   _The Aristocats_: "Hey Napoleon, that sounds like The End." "_I'm_ the leader. _I'll_ say when it's The End." (lettering reading "The End" bumps into his head) "It's The End."
    -   Over a quarter-century earlier, _The Three Caballeros_ ended with an elaborate fireworks display which has "The End" in three languages in the colors of the flags of the countries being represented: "Fin" (in Spanish and in the colors of Mexico's flag), "Fim" (in Portuguese and in the colors of Brazil's flag), and finally, "The End" (in English and in the colors of the flag of the United States).
    -   In fact, just about every single animated Disney movie starting with _Pinocchio_ and ending with _The Fox and the Hound_ actually all ended this way (_Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_ did not have a "The End" card at the end of the film, instead the film ends with a picture of the RKO Radio Pictures logo (but during the RKO Radio era and on the Diamond Edition, Signature Edition, and Disney+ prints of _Snow White_). Some prints of the film from the Buena Vista era (including the 1994 VHS release and the Platinum Edition release) have a "The End" card; the RKO Radio logo was reinstated starting with the Diamond Edition print of the film. The first film since _Snow White_ not to have a "The End" card was 1985's _The Black Cauldron_, which was also the first animated Disney movie to have closing credits since _Alice in Wonderland_).
        -   Occasionally a Disney feature released since then may have "The End" appear before the credits roll, usually as a stylish touch, such as _The Great Mouse Detective_, _Aladdin_, _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_, and _The Emperor's New Groove_.
-   Only four Pixar films use a proper "The End" card at the ending of the film: _A Bug's Life_, _Finding Nemo_, _Finding Dory_ and _Coco_. _Ratatouille_, meanwhile, has a variation: it ends with the word "Fin", which is French for "end." _Luca_ has it in Italian and English: "FINE (The End)"
-   _Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea_ begins with "the beginning" and ends with "the end".
-   Only five Sony Pictures Animation films use a proper "The End" card at the ending of the film: _Open Season_, _Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs_, _Hotel Transylvania_, _Hotel Transylvania 2_ and _Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation_.
-   In _Robot Carnival_, a post-credit scene shows a man's house exploding, replaced with **END** built of steel beams.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   This can lead to Cross-Cultural Kerfluffle in old Swedish films. The Swedish for "The End" is "Slut". _The Phantom Carriage_ and _Häxan_ are two examples of deadly serious dramas that end on a moment of unintentional hilarity (for English-speakers).
-   All of the _Air Buddies_ films end with this caption.
-   _Antonia's Line_: One of the overarching themes of the movie, which follows life in one Dutch village over fifty years, is the circle of life and how nothing really dies. So the final chyron of the movie, right before the credits roll, says "And as this long chronicle reaches its conclusion, nothing has come to an end."
-   The end of the 1956 Best Picture winner _Around the World in 80 Days_: "This IS the end." (As opposed to, "This _are_ the end?")
-   _Back to the Future Part III_ does "The End" in the style of the Back To The Future logo (like "To Be Continued" and "To Be Concluded" in the previous two films).
-   _The Boston Strangler_: The closing credits, after noting that Albert DeSalvo was never tried for the stranglings, say "THIS FILM HAS ENDED, BUT THE RESPONSIBILTY OF SOCIETY FOR THE EARLY RECOGNITION AND TREATMENT OF THE VIOLENT AMONG US HAS YET TO BEGIN."
-   The 1947 Russian version of _Cinderella_ ends with the goofy king finally carrying through on his constant threats to abdicate. He gives his wig and crown to his page boy, then talks for a little bit about how kind and generous the page boy/new king is, and about the page boy's tender feelings. Then he says "I love these wonderful feelings, which will never come to an—", and then he looks straight at the camera and says "—end." This is followed immediately by the closing "The End" title card (Russian конец, "konets").
-   _The Devil Strikes at Night_ is about a Serial Killer case. The movie ends with a telegram reporting that Bruno, the serial killer, was executed. His case file is closed, a "CASE CLOSED" stamp appears on the folder, and the film ends.
-   _The Dove_, a parody of Ingmar Bergman movies, is filled with As Long as It Sounds Foreign faux-Swedish dialogue that mostly consists of putting "-ska" at the ends of words. It ends with "ENDSK" (not "Slut"!).
-   The closing credits of _Fast Times at Ridgemont High_ end on a shot of the "The End" screen from _Missile Command_ (see below).
-   _A Fish Called Wanda_ ends with the word FIN.
-   _Funeral Parade of Roses_: One of the craziest parts of the movie comes at the end, after Eddie has stabbed his eyes out and is staggering down the staircase. Completely out of nowhere, a cheerful man in a suit pops up onscreen. Smiling, he notes how shocking and horrible _Funeral Parade of Roses_ was. Then he says "Let's look forward to the next film! Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye!"
-   The _Get Smart_ movie _The Nude Bomb_ featured the three main characters rendered nude in the final shot; as they ran away from the camera, _three_ "THE END" cards appear over their naked behinds as a Visual Pun.
-   Defied in _Hangmen Also Die!_. The film ends with the following text:
    
    NOT  
    The End
    
-   _Hercules Returns_. As the Italian sword-and-sandal movie comes to an end, The Narrator announces that everything is just dandy. On being told that's "a bit mincey", he decides everything is just...
    
-   Inverted in _Hill 24 Doesn't Answer_, which ends with text reading "THE BEGINNING".
-   Inverted in 1929 Douglas Fairbanks film _The Iron Mask_. It was Fairbanks's farewell to both silent films and the action movie genre that he'd basically invented but was aging out of. It has a Bittersweet Ending in which the Rightful King Returns but all of The Three Musketeers are killed, followed by D'Artagnan himself (Fairbanks) getting killed by a stab wound In the Back. In the last scene D'Artagnan's soul jumps up to the skies to join his departed buddies. The four of them then run off into the heavens to seek "greater adventure beyond". Then the film ends with the following title card:
    
    "The Beginning."
    
    -   Same with the Soviet film _Nachalo_ - but it also features no opening credits whatsoever. Justified, as the film deals with the beginning of the career of a future movie star - and of course, _nachalo_ **is** "the beginning" in Russian.
-   The second _Kill Bill_ movie used this as an affectionate sort of Homage.
-   Every film directed by Stanley Kubrick ended this way. Warner Bros. insisted on following his "The End" card with their logo for _Full Metal Jacket_ and _Eyes Wide Shut_, but for all of his earlier films it is the very last card in the closing credits (where there _are_ closing credits).
-   _Lilies of the Field_: It's a film about a laborer and would-be architect building a chapel for a group of nuns. The laborer (Sidney Poitier) often leads the nuns in singing the old gospel song "Amen". As the film ends, "Amen" comes up onto the screen instead of "The End".
-   In _Love (2015)_ the ending card flashes on screen right after the protagonist says or thinks to… someone "I will love you until the end"; the significance of this juxtaposition is left up to the viewer to decide.
-   _Me and My Gal_: The film ends with Pat Riley stepping in front of the camera, looking at the lens, and saying "Well, it's all over, come on, let's have another drink." He had previously broken the fourth wall to look at the camera and invite the audience for a drink during his daughter's wedding reception.
-   The FIN pun is also used at the end of _The Meg_, whose title character is a megalodon shark with obligatory Shark Fin of Doom.
-   _Mickey Blue Eyes_, where the characters talk about superfluous definite articles in names like "The La Trattoria" and "The La Brea Tar Pits," ends with a "The The End" card.
-   In _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ there are no end credits or titles. Arthur and what's left of the knights are piled into the back of a police van, a cop places his hand over the camera lens and everything goes black. Cue really catchy tune (the extended version of the _intermission_ music). That's all you get for the next five minutes: black screen + catchy tune.
    -   _And Now For Something Completely Different_ starts with the "How Not To Be Seen" sketch, the opening titles and then a sudden "The End."
-   _Moulin Rouge!_ has a variation—at the end of the credits there is a stylistic rendering of the movie (and its Show Within a Show)'s main theme, complete with flourishing font and a big heart: "This is a story about beauty, freedom, truth, and above all things, love."
-   _Muppets Most Wanted_ literally starts with the "The End" of the previous Muppet movie.
-   Experimental Leave the Camera Running documentary interview _Portrait of Jason_, ends, after concluding the interview with Jason Holliday, with director Shirley Clarke offscreen saying "The end. The end. That's it, it's over. The end."
-   _Promise Her Anything_ has the credits rolling over a neon sign advertising "NON-STOP" flights to Italy. At the end the "NON" part burns out leaving only "STOP", and the film stops.
-   In _Road to Bali_, Bob Hope is unsatisfied with the ending, so he keeps trying to shove the "The End" card off the screen, until it becomes "Positively The End."
-   _Screamers: The Hunting_ ends with a shot of the Fetus Terrible sprouting a killing blade and a title card saying THE BEGINNING, implying that the events shown on Sirius 6B will now take place on Earth.
-   At the end of the 1933 version of _State Fair_, the Romantic Rain and wind cause the "State Fair" Title Drop billboard to peel away. The peeled-away sections reveal another poster underneath that says "The End".
-   _The Steel Helmet_: Set in The Korean War. At the end, most of The Squad has died defending the observation post, but Zack, Tanaka, Thompson, and the bald guy survive. They are relieved by another squad and it's implied they go on fighting the war. The title card at the end says:
    
    "There is no end to this picture."
    
-   Surrealistic short film _Stop Look and Listen_ involves two drivers on the side roads of Los Angeles, one safe and the other very unsafe. The short ends with a shot of a street sign that says "END".
-   Every episode of _The Three Stooges_ had a The End card with Greek Comedy/Tragedy masks.
-   _The Trouble with Harry_ offers a variation ending with "The Trouble With Harry... Is Over".
-   Inverted in the British WW2 propaganda movie _The Way Ahead_ (1944) which concludes with the soldiers advancing into the attack with the words THE BEGINNING. One assumes the producers wanted the audience to believe our heroes were just getting started in defeating the Nazis, as opposed to marching off to their END.
-   _Volga-Volga_: A Russian musical film that ends, after a big closing number, with the cast members flipping up big golden cardboard letters that spell конец ("end").
-   As part of its classic horror movie throwback, _Werewolf by Night (2022)_ ends with a black and white "The End" imposed on the shot.
-   _Westfront 1918_: A 1930 German anti-war film that, after a terrifying sequence of soldiers dying horrible deaths in the trenches, ends with a title card saying "ENDE?!". Director G.W. Pabst was of course correct in guessing that the war to end all wars really wasn't the end.
-   _Beach Party_ has "The End Almost" before the credits.
-   The last shot of _Blue Iguana (2018)_ shows Eddie's favorite comic book, open to the last page, which shows the words "THE END."
-   In _I Think I Do (1997)_, the words "The End" appear and are then knocked off the screen by "The Beginning."
-   In _Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows_ Watson ends his chronicle of his adventures with this on his typewriter, before Holmes in his urban disguise adds a question mark when Watson leaves the room, which transitions to the end credits.
-   In _The Ghost Goes Gear_, Spencer holds a clapperboard with "The End" written on it. He bats a piece of equipment out of the shot, then says, "Let's face it, folks, it had to end somewhere. 1282, take 1, the end," and claps it shut.

    Literature 

-   The last book in _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ is actually called _The End_, but this is deeply subverted by the book itself.
    -   At the end of every book there's a letter to the editor, telling him where to find the next manuscript. The last chapter of _The End_ is treated as though it was a separate book contained in the same volume, with a different dedication page, publishing page, etc. Thus, in his letter to the editor:
        
        The End of The End can be found at The End of The End.
        
-   The last entry in the _New Redhouse Turkish-English Dictionary_ is "**züzuniyet**: final word, conclusion." That this is a made-up word is lampshaded in the errata, which correctly points out that "the last entry in the dictionary is unaccountably left without a derivation."
-   The first book of Tamora Pierce's _Song of the Lioness_ quartet ends with "The Beginning".
-   _Unseen Academicals_ has an interesting variant based on a real-life bit of sports announcement. It says "You think it's all over?" twice, before cutting to short epilogue scenes and then, finally, "Now it's over."

    Live-Action TV 

-   The finale of season 3 of _Canada's Worst Driver_ has "The End" appear just after an Iris Out, followed by the closing credits.
-   _Hikonin Sentai Akibaranger_: The _words_ "The End" are the final enemy, which prompts the Akibarangers to team up with the villains to destroy it in a futile attempt to prevent the series from ending.
-   Parodied on _The Kids in the Hall_. One of the sketches was written by a writer who kept making typos. When it's over, a title card comes up reading "THE AND."
-   _Lost_ cuts to black and displays the show's title in white. The season 5 finale ended with the apparent detonation of a hydrogen bomb, so instead it flashed to white and displayed the title in black. This also seems to herald that the status quo has been changed in a major way by the events of the finale.
    -   And the final episode is called 'The End'.
-   _Monty Python's Flying Circus_:
    
    **Announcer (John Cleese):** "Um, I'm sorry about the ... the, er, pause, only I'm afraid the show is a couple of minutes short this week. You know, sometimes the shows aren't really quite as er, long as they ought to be. (pause, he looks round at the sea) Beautiful, isn't it. (he walks out of shot; long pause; he walks back) Look there's not really a great deal of point in your, sort of hanging on at your end, because I'm afraid there aren't any more jokes or anything."
    
    -   In the Michael Ellis episode, "The End" and the closing credits _immediately_ follow the opening titles.
    -   In the "How to Recognize Different Parts of the Body" episode, Inspector Zatapathique bows after his performance of "Bing Tiddle Tiddle Bong." An arrow appears pointing at his rear end, and the voiceover says, "Number 31: The End."
    -   "_Nobody_ expects the Sp—" **THE END** "Oh, bugger!"
    -   In one sketch, a presenter demonstrates a gesture he wants to use to show he's finished talking. As he does so, the series' "THE END" card appears, and he has to shoo it away.
    -   "Owl-Stretching Time" ends with the Colonel, who's had it with all this nonsense, coming onscreen and saying "Right! No, I warned you, no, I warned you about the slogan, right. That's the end. Stop the programme! Stop it." And the credits roll.
    -   One episode had Eric Idle in several sketches as a store customer. Not satisfied with the ending of the episode, he goes back to the store to buy a better one, and the counterman makes several suggestions. "Romantic ending?" "No." "Fade to black?" "Nah." "How about a sudden ending?" Smash cut to the closing production-company logo.
-   The _last_ episode of _Red Dwarf_ ends with "THE END" on a black background, held in silence for several seconds... until the words "THE SMEG IT IS!" appear, to a cheering audience. There would not be any continuation, however, for a decade.
    -   Also, the first episode of _Red Dwarf_ is titled "The End". At the end of the episode the screen fades to an intertitle declaring "The Beginning".
-   The _Merlin_ made-for-TV movie. "There's no more. That's The End of magic." No, really, that's how it ends!
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_'s Musical Episode "Once More With Feeling" ends with a big beautiful splashy "The End"...overlaid on an image of Buffy and Spike kissing.
-   The season five finale (and could-have-been Grand Finale) of _Supernatural_ ends with Chuck the prophet typing up the last chapter of his visions while pondering how hard it is to deliver a satisfying ending. We see him type the actual words "The End". "No doubt, endings are hard - but then, nothing ever really ends, does it?" He smiles and vanishes into thin air, implying he might have actually been God.
-   _The Goodies_. The episode "The Movies" has a string of Breaking the Fourth Wall gags, culminating in the letters of THE END being used by the comedic heroes to thump each other. Then another THE END starts floating up the screen, catching on their clothes and carrying them off into the sunset.
-   Each episode of _The Dead Files_ ends with static statements talking about what the clients have (or haven't) done in regards to Amy's advice on how to deal with the reported haunting, along with the state of the paranormal activity.
-   The soap opera _Guiding Light_ ended its 57-year run on CBS with its two principals happily driving off into the horizon as "The End" slowly appears on the screen, followed by a slow fade out.
-   The Filipino version for this is "Wakas" ("End") and is sometimes used to close the finale of a Soap Opera before the credits roll.

    Music 

-   The Beatles song "The End" was supposed to be the actual end of _Abbey Road_, but "Her Majesty" got tacked onto the end as a secret track.
-   The first track of the My Chemical Romance album _The Black Parade_ is entitled "The End." (note the full stop), signifying the Patient's approaching death.
-   The bonus track on the explicit version of Blue October's _Approaching Normal_ is entitled "The End". With an "Everybody Dies" Ending, to boot.
-   A Flock of Seagulls' "The End", which precedes _The Story Of A Young Heart_'s final track "Suicide Day".
-   The Doors ended their first album, _The Doors_ with The End, a song which insinuates at first that death is not as bad as some think. That idea gets abandoned quickly as the song progresses into Nightmare Fuel territory, particularly in the infamous "the killer awoke before dawn" sequence.
-   Jack Stauber's "The End" is a nightmarish one. The only lyrics to the song espouse that "There are no happy ends; there's just The End", and the accompanying music video is filled with end cards to movies and television shows.
-   They Might Be Giants: "Everything Right Is Wrong Again" ends with the lyrics "And now this song is over now (x3)/This song is over now." As categorical as this is, the same lyrics occur _midway_ through the song also.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Century_: Due to the games' nature as a trilogy, _A New World_, the final installment, has "The End" printed on the side of the box.

-   The animated cutscene which ends the re-release of _Chrono Trigger_ ends with "Fin" after the Sequel Hook to _Chrono Cross_.
-   _Contra Spirits_ has a Chinese bootleg NES version which ends with "THEND" (sic).
-   _Cute Knight_ series: Happens for both games, with buttons, but they do different things in each.
    -   The first game, _Cute Knight_, ends its endings with a "The End" button that moves the game to the credits.
    -   _Cute Knight Kingdom_, ends its endings with a "The End" button that moves the game to the Start Screen, and a "Save Story" button that has the player select a location on their computer to save the ending screen text to.
-   _Darkwing Duck_ on NES just has a The End screen and no credits.
-   It happens to every ending in _A Day In The Life Of A Slice Of Bread_.
-   The final ending cutscene in _Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth_ shows someone In-Universe had written "owari" (Over) via the mayonnaise on Kyoko's coffee in her office, a final show of her odd drinking habits and the character the player has come to know over the course of the game, before Fade to Black.
-   _Donkey Kong Country_ tries to trick you with a fake credits during the final boss. After the Fake-Out Fade-Out, it says "The End?"
-   The original _Doom_ would give you a large "THE END" over a backdrop of a burning city and spiked rabbit's head after completing the third (and then final) episode, which was then riddled with a burst of bullet holes for emphasis. Then the game was later re-released as _The Ultimate Doom_ with a fourth episode tacked-on, but the game's "THE END" sequence was still only displayed after beating the third episode. Episode four just got the same generic ending style as the first two episodes.
-   _Dragon Quest XI_ features both variants; the words "The end" close off its first ending, though they're followed by a To Be Continued to let you know there's more. The true ending instead has a feather pen write "Fin".
-   _DX Ball_: The last board in the game has exploding bricks forming the words "THE END".
-   In _The End Is Nigh_, The End uses the title of the game, as well as the first world's name and the ending title after the credits.
-   A staple of the _Final Fantasy_ series, which end with either "THE END" or "Fin" on a starry background. Noteworthy examples include:
    -   _Final Fantasy VIII_, in which Selphie's best Limit Break called The End automatically finished a battle by transporting the monsters to a floral field with butterflies flittering all over. The screen goes dark, and text comes up reading THE END. It can defeat any monster including Omega Weapon. It also has a true "The end" screen after the credits.
    -   _Final Fantasy Type-0_, whose original PSP release has the kanji "完" substituting for the usual "The End". The HD release has both, with the words "The End" under the kanji.
    -   _World of Final Fantasy_, which has a giant "END" graphic in broken letters during the game's bad ending. However, in a partial subversion, the true ending has no such equivalent.
-   The True Final Boss of _Hellsinker_ simply ends with a "The End".
-   _AI Dungeon 2_: Some of its adventures end this way, like this one, drawn from a list of adventures, here, at Ars Technica:
    
    Your ghost reports the cop to his supervisor who then calls an ambulance. The End.
    
-   Staple of _The Legend of Zelda_.
-   _Metal Slug_ games always show the "Game Over" screen after the credits, but with "PEACE FOREVER!" written over it. _Metal Slug 2_ subverts this as it shows only the "Game Over" screen after the credits, but no "PEACE FOREVER!" written over it. _Metal Slug 3_ onwards play this trope straighter by showing "THE END" just before the ranking screen.
-   The End is a realm in _Minecraft_, populated by Endermen and the Enderdragon. After defeating the Enderdragon you have officially "completed" the game, though you are still free to continue playing.
    -   Guess what the achievement for beating the game is called?
-   The arcade game _Missile Command_ takes these two words to a disturbing level. Instead of the traditional Game Over screen when all your cities are destroyed, you get a seizure-riffic explosion with the words on them. The programmers of the game claimed to have given themselves nightmares over this screen.
-   Double subverted in _Mother 3_. After the final cutscene, the player is shown a black screen with the text "End?". Moving the + Control Pad, though, finds you still in control, it's just that you're in a location with nothing but black and "End?" in it. Walking around you'll find all the characters, who you can talk to, before the credits. Adding to the fun is that it's combined with Medium Awareness - it soon becomes clear you're not controlling Lucas, but _yourself._ Everyone will say things like, "Oh, it's Player Name! Lucas said he wanted to talk to you!" or "Hey everyone, it's Player Name! Thanks for helping out back there!" Then, after this and the credits roll, you get a _real_ "The End" screen, showing the game's logo purely written in wood and with the Earth (as opposed to a steel ball) standing in for the O, with the word "END" written under it.
-   In keeping with its cinema motifs, _Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth_ features both "THE END" closing off its first Game Over screen, and "fin" closing off the ending as well as the second Game Over screen.
-   A staple of the _Pikmin_ series. The first game goes the extra mile by stating "The HAPPY End" if you collect all ship parts.
-   In _Portal 2_, after GLaDOS's obligatory, cheerful song playing during the credits, there's a small movie sequence where Wheatley and the Space Core are floating around in space, and Wheatley talks about how much he regrets what he did. He ends the scene by simply saying "The end."
-   _Shining Force II_ features "Fin." after its credits. It also features an easter egg: wait on that screen long enough and a text box will pop up saying "And more...", then a secret battle will start.
-   Eliminating last target in _Sniper: Ghost Warrior_ results in displaying "THE END" sentence followed by credits.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_:
    -   The _Sonic Adventure_ games and _Sonic Heroes_ use _Fin_ at the end.
    -   _Sonic Frontiers_: The True Final Boss is literally called **THE END**. Considering it's an Eldritch Abomination that's responsible for the destruction of the Ancients and their homeworld, not to mention being a Greater-Scope Villain for the _**entire**_ _Sonic the Hedgehog_ franchise, this is _certainly_ a case of Names to Run Away from Really Fast.
    -   Updated Re-release _Sonic Origins_ uses "Fin" to close off the new animated ending for _Sonic 3 & Knuckles_.
-   _The End_ was the name of a _Space Invaders_\-like arcade game by Konami which ended when the aliens pulled out enough blocks to spell the word "END" across the top of the screen.
-   _The Stanley Parable_ has a suitably subversive twist which fits the style of the game. Firstly, it is seen at the start of the game as the game loads as "THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER" repeated over and over - fitting for a game that has many endings that drop you back at the start of the game.
-   _Star Fox 64_ closes its true ending credits with "THE END" after the Star Fox team flies off into the sunset. Get the bad ending, and the letters are replaced with a looming image of a laughing Andross.
-   The _Street Fighter: The Movie_ videogame adaptation (i.e. the game of the movie of the game) had a nice spin on the typical 'Game Over' screen, especially effective when it was after the end credits; rather than simply display the words, the game played the clip from the movie of Raul Julia as M. Bison shouting it, with much glee.
-   All of the _Super Mario Bros._ main series games from _Super Mario Bros. 2_ onwards.
    -   Most of the 3D games accompany this with a "Thank you so much for playing my game!" from either Mario or Luigi.
-   _This Book Is A Dungeon_: The Bad Ends of its Multiple Endings use the line:
    
    You've perished in one of many horrible ways. Try again and seek to change your fate!
    
    The End.
    
    \[Restart\]
    
-   In _Undertale_, "The End" is the caption for the last Save Point in the ordinary game, and it's made quite clear that the Point of No Return lies just beyond it.
-   At the end of a campaign, _Wing Commander_ finished with "The End" (with fireworks if you got the good ending), and follows it by "For now".
-   _Zone of the Enders_ plays with the trope, featuring such a screen in the game's ''bad'" ending. If you destroy all buildings and kill all civilians in the game's SOS missions, gameplay will be brutally cut off by Thunderheart dying when you're supposed to get in contact with him. ADA chastises Leo, and by extension the player, for directly causing his death, and the game ends on a screen with giant "THE END" letters and a burning, destroyed colony city in the background.

    Web Original 

-   _KateModern_ featured an episode with the title "The End" mid-series.
-   And of course, there's _Teen Girl Squad_ and "It's over!" Initially subverted in TGS Episode 5, which features "It's almost over!" shortly before "Now it's over!".
-   _The Demented Cartoon Movie_ begins with a short introduction, transitioning from card to card with an appropriate rumbling fanfare, before finally reaching the title card for _The Demented Cartoon Movie (abridged version)_. The very next slide reads, _The end_. It goes black for a few seconds, then apologizes and starts the _real_ introduction to the movie. This is a throwback to _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_.
    -   "HAPPY END!!!"
-   _Arfenhouse Teh Movie Too_ shows "TEH EDN!!1111!1!!!!!1" as the heading for a few seconds of real but premature credits at an anticlimactic moment halfway through the movie.
-   A video meme shows a screen playing the last few wholesome seconds of _Finding Dory_, but this is apparently the Swedish translation, so instead of "The End" it says "Slut."

    Western Animation 

-   Another variation is just "END". Like in the _Prometheus and Bob_ shorts.
-   The _Looney Tunes_ sometimes had a "the end" at the end of a short and sometimes didn't, but almost always had "That's all, folks!" in the closing credits.
    -   A few cartoons from the late 30s through the 40s edited as Merrie Melodies Blue Ribbon reissues in the early 50s had "The End" in Lydian typeface instead of "That's all, Folks!"
    -   _Guided Muscle_ ends with the Coyote pulling the "That's all, folks!" card across the screen.
    -   Halfway through _Duck Amuck_, Daffy Duck demands "Let's get this picture started!"... and it irises out to a "The End" title, which Daffy pushes away while shouting _"NO! NO!"_ in frustrated tones.
        -   In _Duck Amuck_'s Spiritual Successor short _Rabbit Rampage_, on the other hand, Bugs Bunny uses the end card as a last-ditch _escape_ from the cartoon.
    -   In _A Ham in a Role_ the "That's all, folks!" card appears barely thirty seconds in. That's because it's a Show Within a Show and the protagonist is an Animated Actor filming a Warner Brothers cartoon.
-   Early Cartoon Network shows had "The End" cards:
    -   All the shorts in the _What a Cartoon!_ anthology show had this.
    -   _Dexter's Laboratory_
    -   _Johnny Bravo_ (first season only)
    -   A variation with _Cow and Chicken_ where it was just "End" (and someone else yelling "END!"). Interestingly, the _I Am Weasel_ segments never used an end card.
    -   _Courage the Cowardly Dog_
    -   So Once Again, the Day Is Saved thanks to The Powerpuff Girls! (The End)
    -   _Codename: Kids Next Door_, where it types "END TRANSMISSION".
    -   _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_ (Only in 11-minute episodes and in "One False Movie," they showed a "THE END" card cutting off Bloo's dialogue.)
-   Cartoons with a retro theme such as those from Frederator use "The End" cards:
    -   _The Fairly Oddparents_
    -   _Danny Phantom_
    -   _My Life as a Teenage Robot_
    -   _ChalkZone_
    -   _T.U.F.F. Puppy_
-   _I ♡ Arlo_: The Season 1 finale "The Uncondemning" ends with this caption.
-   The _Inspector_ cartoons by De Patie Freleng Enterprises had a "Finis" title with the "I"s as two eyes.
-   In _Wacky Races_ "The End" appears above the Mean Machine in the end credits - and then falls onto the car and wrecks it, much to Muttley's amusement.
    -   On rare occasions when there’s voice acting over the credits, Dastardly will mention how he’s trying to get an unfair advantage over the racers since the race starts next week- and promptly says "Drat!" when the words crush the Mean Machine.
-   In _The Simpsons_, the "Worker and Parasite" cartoon ends with a card reading "Endut! Hoch Hech!"
-   Groundbreaking 1894 French cartoon _Autour d'une cabine_ is about swimmers at the beach. After the lovers swim away from the beach, a man in a row-boat comes out and unfurls a sail that says "LA REPRESENTATION EST TERMINEE".
-   The _Curious George_ animated shorts from 1980 ended with George painting "The" with his hand and "End" with his foot simultaneously on a wall, accompanied by a ten-note synth flourish.
-   _Uncle Grandpa_ plays with this: the word "Fin" appears on screen (also used as an equivalent of "The End" in some other works, such as the Sonic games above), followed by a fish with Uncle Grandpa's face. The word then points at the fish's fin and Uncle Grandpa asks if we got the joke.
-   One episode of _Adventure Time_ (also by Frederator) had a "The End" card, displayed on a typewriter, which fit in with the rest of the episode—the typewriter belonged to the main character of the episode.
-   _Is It Always Right to Be Right?_: Schmidt's essay concludes by describing the search for common ground as "a task that never ends." Appropriately, the cartoon ends with a closing title that says "NOT THE END."
-   _Munro_ is a satirical cartoon about a four-year-old boy who is drafted and inducted into the U.S. Army. He is completely mystified by his drill instructor barking cadence during a march. At the end the drill instructor reappears and barks out "THE END."
-   Both _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ and its Sequel Series _The Legend of Korra_ end their final episodes with the Chinese characters "劇終", literally meaning "The End", with the translation under them.
-   In the final episode of _Amphibia_, once the credits stop rolling, a text appears written in untranslated Thai ("จบบริบูรณ้") which means "complete"/"end".
