_"I'll get you, my pretty — and your little dog too!"_

When the villain threatens or targets an innocent for the sole purpose of showing how evil he is, and that innocent just happens to be something the hero cares a lot about — which justifies the hero kicking butt over it.

A hero, for the most part, is not supposed to care what happens to themselves. However, once the villain has threatened that one thing that the hero must protect, they will commit to opposing the villain.

Whether it's a typical Friendly Target like the Love Interest, the hero's hometown, or the hero's family, once the villain has found a hero's "weak point", nothing less than his complete destruction will get him to leave the hero's world alone — even when attacking this "weak point" consistently brings the hero down on his head with more than the usual enthusiasm.

Sometimes there's a particular reason for this obsession, such as Blackmail, vengeance or some other Offer The Hero Can't Refuse, but for the most part, it's a plot device used by the writer to get the hero involved.

Beware. If the hero attempts Refusal of the Call despite this, they will be punished because The Call Knows Where \[They\] Live.

Typically crosses over with Your Little Dismissive Diminutive and I Will Punish Your Friend for Your Failure. Targeted to Hurt the Hero is a more general case where the targeting is not just done to be petty. Compare Kick the Dog, for a more proactive villain; and Bad People Abuse Animals, for when it's LITERALLY a dog. Compare and contrast Revenge by Proxy (where the villain is doing this sort of thing for the sake of retaliation). See Even Mooks Have Loved Ones for when it's done to a minion. When used to top off some other unspeakably evil acts, some (arguably heartless) people may view this as a case of Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking.

-   A commercial for Energizer batteries featured The Wicked Witch of the West herself looking down at the Energizer Bunny making his way to the Wizard's Castle in her crystal ball. Before she sets off on her broom to seek and destroy him, she declares "I'll get you, my pretty, and your little battery, too!"

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Lone Wolf and Cub_ (one of the Western names for this was _Shogun Assassin_) had the main character (Ogami Ichirou) killing _hundreds_ of the Shogun's troops, very violently. Said Shogun declares that he's willing to leave Ogami alone, but just to be a snit, his dear infant son Daigoro must die. ...so Ogami, as the good Papa Wolf that he is, destroys the rest, resulting in the viewer concluding that Shogun was an idiot for not predicting that.
-   In episode 7 of _One Piece_, when Buggy learns how much Luffy values the straw hat he got from Shanks, he tries to destroy it... which only provokes Luffy further. To be fair, Buggy hates _Shanks_ even more than he hates Luffy.
-   _Bleach_ is pretty fond of these; the lead being an All-Loving Hero, he can't actively seek combat, so they use this as a method to make him. For example:
    -   In the Shinigami Arc, the hollow that killed his mother (for worse, he was a little child back then, and she died protecting him).
    -   In the Soul Society Arc, he was allowed to fight because they were going to execute his friend Rukia.
    -   During the Arrancar's attack on the real world, they attacked his friends and family. And then, his _dad_ got to off the hollow (now an Arrancar) that killed his wife and the lead's mom.
    -   In the Hueco Mundo Arc, they forced his _other_ friend Orihime to go with them via Sadistic Choice — it's even pointed out for that final closure (just in case taking poor Orihime away wasn't enough) that the Big Bad wants to destroy his home town so that he has fuel for his MacGuffin.
-   Due to their nearly symbiotic relationship, the weapons and technicians in _Soul Eater_ frequently have each other as their Berserk Button, especially the female characters for the male ones.
-   _Rurouni Kenshin_: Yukishiro Enishi has held a grudge against Kenshin fo years after Kenshin's Accidental Murder of Enishi's elder sister Tomoe, to the extent that he repeatedly targets Kenshin's True Companions, including his Love Interest Kaoru, in order to make Kenshin suffer.
-   In _My-HiME_, at least Mai is provoked this way when the first Monster of the Week targets her ill and weak-willed brother Takumi. Later events, in a subversion of this trope, imply that this is the standard method of "initiation" for most HiMEs, with the monster attacks carefully planned by the Powers That Be specifically to attack their loved ones to draw them into fighting.
-   In _Knight Hunters_, to get back at Ran "Aya" Fujimiya for his part in killing their boss, the Schreient girls kidnap his comatose little sister Aya-chan and hold her hostage, intending to kill her in front of him. This results _directly_ in Aya rejoining Weiss to hunt them down and kill them.
-   _Claymore_: Threaten to rape/disfigure/brutalize the mightiest of an order of demonslayers pledged not to take human life? She says "Fine, I don't care," and thinks uncharitable thoughts. Kick around the girl that was following her around? She _draws the guy's own sword_ and makes perfectly clear that, if the order in question has to put her down, he will still be dead. The failure of the bandit in question to keep that hint in mind when he finds said girl in a village the Claymore he threatened just left kicks off a Roaring Rampage of Revenge that was both brief... and **total**.
-   The Team Rocket trio's obsession with Ash's Pikachu in _Pokémon: The Series_ since really, aside from a bad attitude about Poke Balls, Pikachu wasn't much different from any other Pokemon. Yet the threat makes them the main villains regardless.
-   In _Saint Seiya_, Dragon Shiryu was almost dead by the hand of Cancer Deathmask, a purely evil Golden Saint who was completely immoral about murder, even killing children for the lulz. Cue to the image of Shiryu's stepsister Shunrei praying far, far away in the Rozan cascade. Cue back to Deathmask being upset about that and using his Psychic Powers to grab the poor girl and throw her down a waterfall in hopes of killing her and projects the image _in Shiryu's mind_ to taunt him with what he just did. See the always calm, cool and collected Shiryu _go absolutely batshit on Deathmask_ in his only ever Unstoppable Rage episode in the series, as Cancer's attempt at murder backfires on him big time.
-   In the _Ea Cycle_ Morjin threatens to kill Valashu's family. He later follows on his promise. Brutally.
-   In _Chrono Crusade_, Rosette and Chrono probably would have never gotten into the demon-hunting business at all, much less tried to stop Aion's plans, if it hadn't been for him kidnapping Rosette's brother in the first place.
-   Literal non-example, in _Black Lagoon_; Balalaika reminds the leaders of the other criminal organisations that her organisation will destroy anyone who gets in their way, and their families, and even their pet dog, if necessary.
-   In the _Read or Die_ TV series, both groups of The Men in Black choose to repeatedly target a normal writer for their sinister plan, despite it being easy enough to just find someone else. This leads her friends, various heroines who used to work for the groups, to rebel against them.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Frieza indulging in this is what triggers Goku's first Super Saiyan transformation, leading to him beating Frieza to a pulp. _First_ he kills Krillin, who was no threat to him whatsoever and had already been revived once, meaning (as far as Goku knew) he couldn't come back again. Then he declares he's going to do the same to Gohan. Goku promptly transforms.
    -   Cell decides to invoke this in order to bring out Gohan's hidden power. Since Gohan refuses to get angry and unleash his power no matter what Cell does to _him_, he decides to spawn seven Cell Jrs. and make Gohan watch as he sics them on the Z-Fighters, to see if _that_ will make him angry. The final straw is when he crushes Android 16's head underfoot right in front of Gohan, and Cell gets what he wanted.
    -   In _Dragon Ball Super_, Vegeta invokes this by threatening to kill Cabba's family and people, causing Cabba to become so angry he turns into a Super Saiyan for the first time. After Vegeta defeats him, he makes it clear he had no intention of actually doing that and just wanted Cabba to reach his potential.
    -   After Zamasu wishes to switch bodies with an alternate Goku, becoming "Goku Black", he proceeds to murder him - then, just for the heck of it, callously murders both Chi-Chi and Goten. He even takes the opportunity to reveal this to Goku purely for the sake of being a dick, and Goku promptly flies into an Unstoppable Rage; to note, this is one of the few times in the franchise, especially as an adult, that Goku outright tries to _murder_ someone rather than simply defeat them.
    -   During the Tournament of Power, Jiren constantly rants to Goku that trust and friendship is meaningless and strength is all that matters. During the final leg, Jiren ends up furious over Goku's constant remarks about The Power of Friendship and outright attempts to murder Goku's friends and loved ones in the stands to prove his point. Goku deflects the blast, and is so outraged at Jiren for doing something that underhanded that he beats him into the ground.
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul_, when straight-up Cold-Blooded Torture fails to break Kaneki, Yamori decides to get creative. He brings in a pair of prisoners Kaneki had sacrificed himself to protect and orders him to decide which of them will die. Then he brutally murders them both, just for good measure. This is the event that throws Kaneki over the Despair Event Horizon and leads him to decide that it's better to Pay Evil unto Evil — the next time Yamori visits his Torture Cellar, Kaneki breaks free and beats his tormentor within an inch of his life, then leaves him crippled for CCG to find and finish off. This event transforms the gentle and kindhearted Kaneki into a ruthless Anti-Hero, willing to do _whatever_ is necessary to keep the people he cares about safe.
-   _Trigun_: How the Gung-Ho Guns (and Knives) keep doing harm to Vash the Stampede: because the goofball is enough of a Martyr Without a Cause that he doesn't mind being hurt himself, they just exterminate everybody that he cares about, everybody that so much as gives him the time of day, and everybody else in the immediate area. One of Vash's greatest showcases of what happens when he reaches the Rage Breaking Point is when Monev the Gale, in his single-minded hunt to kill him, slaughters an entire town with machine gun fire in the hope that Vash will be hit by it.
-   _My Hero Academia_: Dabi's entire career as a supervillain is revealed to be a calculated method of giving his father Endeavor a mix between a Hope Spot and Laser-Guided Karma for the life-threatening training he put him through as a kid: he'll let his father build his life back up again, then when he's on the verge of stability, rip away everything and everyone he cares about the most, even if they're not directly related. When called out on the wanton destruction by the heroes, he says it's Worth It if the casualties hurt Endeavor that much more.

-   Parodied in the first issue of _Radioactive Man_, where Claude manages to thwart the saboteurs while in disguise. He's about to come clean until one of them vows to escape from prison, discover the identity of the man who stopped him, and then kill him, his girlfriend, his parents, _and_ his dog.

Family, friends, his drug dealer, his pharmacist, his former employers, right down to grade school classmates, a total of over _200_ people. _Then_ he kills the guy.
-   _S.W.O.R.D. (2009)_: A Knull-possessed Kid Cable is ranting about how he's going to take over Frenzy and make her hunt down and kill all her loved ones after she rips off his robot arm.

    _(Spidey kicks open a nearby container full of water, which splashes Electro, knocking him out)_

    Comic Strips 

-   In Darby Conley's _Get Fuzzy_, a cat named Whitey threatens Bucky Katt<small>◊</small> with this when the latter can't pay back the large sum of money he owes. It backfires on Whitey because unlike other examples of this trope, Bucky happens to be a sociopath:
    
    **Whitey:** You have one week to pay up, Katt, or your dog buddy meets with an accident, capisce?  
    **Bucky:** That's fine, kill the dog. In fact, kill him now, it'll save you a trip next week.  
    **Whitey:** OK, I see how it is. Forget the dog, we'll take out your human.  
    **Bucky:** You know, that's not a bad idea. He'd probably be easier to take out, yeah.  
    **Whitey:** Okay, wait, gimme a minute, I'll think of something.  
    **Bucky:** Hey, my neighbor's a total melvin too, any chance for a twofer?

-   _Rosario Vampire: Brightest Darkness_:
    -   In Act IV chapter 11, after revealing that her attempts at redemption were all an act, Falla tells Tsukune that when she's finished killing them, she'll visit Tsukune's mom and cousin and show them just "what kind of friend" she really is.

-   Sunset Shimmer makes a reference to this trope in _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_. It is subverted at the end, though, as if she does have Spike kidnapped by her flunkies, it is mainly to get Twilight where she wants her; she never truly intends to harm the dog (or so she says).

-   _Bumblebee_: Throughout the film, Shatter can't help but throw a sadistically cruel remark before having someone killed. With Bumblebee at her mercy, she gloats that she'll kill Charlie after she's done with him, prompting Bumblebee into a Taking You with Me moment.
-   Cyrus "the Virus" Grissom of _Con Air_ just _might_ have lived and escaped if he didn't make the **terminally stupid** mistake of telling Cameron Poe (the hero) _"Before I kill you, I'll let you know that the last thing that little Casey Poe (your daughter) will ever smell will be my stinking breath."_ Sure enough, cue Heroic Resolve from Cameron, and a hilarious Karmic Death under a rock-crusher (don't ask) no more than five minutes later.
-   _The Dark Knight_. Who else but Maggie Gyllenhaal could be worthy of turning Harvey Dent into Two-Face?
-   In _Dracula Untold_, the other vampires killed EVERYBODY in the battlefield as Vlad fought Mehmet. Only Vlad's son, who was prisoner of Mehmet, remained... with his tasty blood still in his veins.

-   In _Highlander_, the Kurgan takes pleasure in raping poor Heather as an act of dominance over the recently-slain Ramirez. Centuries later in 1986 New York, he gloats over the act to Connor and realizes from his disturbed reaction that Heather was actually _his_ woman (she never told Connor as she likely feared he would go after the Kurgan and be killed).
-   _The Hobbit_: Smaug takes quite a bit of pleasure in barbecuing literally everything that opposes him, or vaguely related to those who oppose him — _especially_ if he knows the first party cares about the second party's well-being.
-   _Hudson Hawk_: The titular hero is threatened with this by one of the Big Bad Duumvirate. He isn't fazed in the slightest.
-   _James Bond_:
    -   In _Licence to Kill_, Franz Sanchez doesn't limit himself to take revenge on Felix Leiter himself for arresting him. His men also kill Leiter's newlywed wife, likely after raping her.
    -   In the Distant Prologue of _No Time to Die_, Lyutsifer Safin targets the family of Mr. White, namely his French ex-wife and daughter Madeleine Swann, who are both hiding in a house of his in Norway. Safin does so in retribution for White poisoning his whole family to death.

-   Lampshaded in _Kung Pow! Enter the Fist_, in a scene where all the main character's friends die one by one, ending with his dog. They all get better, except The Rival.
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_
    -   In _Thor_, Thor finally stops trying to reason with a now Ax-Crazy Loki and attacks him when Loki threatens to pay Jane Foster a "visit".
    -   Loki does this again in _The Avengers (2012)_ while being interrogated by Black Widow. Having brainwashed Clint Barton / Hawkeye, her old friend and comrade, he vows to make Barton kill her in the most sadistic manner possible, then give him his free will back just long enough to see what he's done before killing him, too.
    -   In _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ once the Vulture figures out Peter is Spider-Man he threatens to kill him and everyone he loves if he keeps interfereing. _How It Should Have Ended_ notices that, taken literally, this means he'll have to kill his own daughter.
    -   _Black Panther (2018)_ - similar to the _Thor_ example, T'Challa stops trying to reason with Erik / N'Jadaka after he vows to hunt down and kill anyone who even _thinks_ of staying loyal to T'Challa.
-   In _No Country for Old Men_, Llewellyn calmly advises Chigurh not to threaten his wife. And then Chigurh kills her anyway. It's even worse than that; Chigurh has already found the money he was looking for, and Llewellyn is already dead (at someone else’s hands). Chigurh has absolutely no reason to kill the wife, other than to make good on his threat.
-   In _The Patriot (2000)_, it is Col. Tavington's pathological targeting of Benjamin Martin's family that turns the protagonist from a mild-mannered pacifist to a furious hatchet-wielding 'ghost' who empowers militia forces and inspires his compatriots to victory.
-   The mobsters in _The Phenix City Story_ dump the dead body of Zeke Ward's daughter on the Pattersons' lawn with a note attached.
    
    This will happen to your kids too.
    
-   _Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows_
    -   Moriarty in makes a point of attacking and threatening Watson just because he knows Holmes holds him in high regard. Holmes even goes to Moriarty's office on Watson's wedding day to plead with the professor not to involve him in their ongoing conflict, only to be told that Watson is 'collateral damage' and the professor has already made sure to send his 'regards' to the happy couple (in the form of a squad of assassins who attack Watson and his bride during the train journey to their honeymoon). Although initially he implies that if Holmes backs down, then Moriarty will too, so Pragmatic Villainy is involved.
    -   The trope occurs again at the end of the movie when Holmes reveals he's bested Moriarty, who again promises revenge against Watson and his wife out of revenge. Holmes is facing certain death at that point, so such revenge would be completely gratuitous.
-   _Secret Service of the Imperial Court_ has the villainous Eunuch who threatens the protagonist's father with this line:
    
    "I'm telling you...if you don't hand over your son, I'll cook your families as food for you!"
    
-   Literally done in _Shooter_ when they kill his dog.
-   Lampshaded in The Western movie _Silverado_ (1985) when corrupt town sheriff Cobb indicates to Paden that he'll harm Stella, the female bartender, if Paden moves against him, even though Cobb acknowledges she has nothing whatsoever to do with their dispute. He does, however, know Paden (whom he used to work with when they were robbers) got caught while protecting a wounded dog he'd previously claimed to despise, so figures the threat will make Paden back off. It works at first, but the bartender figures out what's happened and talks Paden into fighting Cobb anyway.
-   Lampshaded in _Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022)_ when Dr. Eggman quotes the trope while threatening Sonic's loved ones to goad him into attacking, allowing Knuckles to get the jump on him.
-   _Spider-Man Trilogy_:
    -   The Green Goblin of the first _Spider-Man_ movie surely should have known that telling Peter that "M.J. (your girlfriend) and I... we're gonna have a **hell** of a time!" while waving a phallic weapon in his face would give Peter the righteous rage to kick his armored-ass to hell and back; and Peter did.
    -   To top it off, in _Spider-Man 2_, the one thing that has Peter spring back into action and regain his powers is Dr. Octopus kidnapping Mary Jane.
    -   In fact, all three movies involved kidnapping Mary Jane at the climax. How very original of them.
-   In _Star Wars_: _Return of the Jedi_, Darth Vader threatens to try and turn Leia to The Dark Side, prompting Luke to attack him with renewed vigor. Possibly an Invoked Trope, as both Vader and the Emperor wanted Luke to be angry so it would be easier to turn him to the Dark Side.
-   The corrupt agent Atwood in _Timecop_ won't testify against the Big Bad he's secretly working for because "He'll send somebody back to wipe out my grandparents. It'll be like I never existed. My mother, my father, my wife, my kids, my fucking cat!"
-   _Unforgiven_: "Any sumbitch takes a shot at me, I'm not only gonna kill him, but I'm gonna kill his wife, all his friends, and burn his damn house down." — Will Munny
-   Subverted in _The Usual Suspects_. Drug dealers rape Keyser Soze's wife, cut his son's throat in front of his eyes, then threaten to kill the rest of his family unless he hands over his turf. He responds by killing two of the drug dealers, then the _rest_ of his family, then hunting down the drug dealers' families and everyone they've ever known or done business with, while the narrator explains that Soze's real strength is his willingness to do what the other guy wouldn't.
-   _The Wizard of Oz_ is the Trope Namer. The Wicked Witch of the West declares, "I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!" just to show how evil she is by threatening Dorothy's beloved pet. It's actions like this that prove the Witch is evil, to justify Dorothy's eventual melting of the Witch. It's also because it's All Just a Dream and the witch was based on Miss Gulch, a nasty old woman who tried to have Toto destroyed for biting her, and who Dorothy even called a "wicked old witch".
-   In _Zoolander_, a protester shouts to Mugatu "Screw you, and your little dog too!".

    Literature 

-   A literary example: In _The Aeneid_, Aeneas' rival and counterpart Turnus kills Aeneas' good friend, the innocent youth Pallas; at the end of the epic, Aeneas is about to spare Turnus' life when the sight of a baldric stolen from Pallas reminds him of the murder and drives him into a killing rage.
-   _The Algebraist_, by Iain Banks. A Galactic Conqueror wants the cooperation of an alien species, so proceeds to space hundreds of men, women and children from the human colony he's just conquered, immobilised yet fully conscious.

I will visit such death upon whatever is yours that your very name will be remembered only in curses and tales of terror.
    
-   _Dying of the Light_: When Jaan's less-than-wise attempt to stop a duel leads to him being challenged, the challenger's teyn starts raving that now they're going to kill Jaan and Garse and Dirk and Gwen and Arkin. Jaan ignores him, and continues with the dueling ritual.

-   Done accidentally in _The Iliad_: With Achilles sulking in his tent, his very good friend and cousin Patroclus donned Achilles' armor to bolster morale and strike fear in the enemies hearts.

After seeing the horrific things Mr.15 had already done to his protégé, Zettai, Eric resolved to kill him dead. Even after Mr.15 mana mutates, and thus no longer has any idea who he is or what threats he's made, Eric says that he can't risk Mr.15 ever coming back.
    -   In _Air Battle Force_, General Gryzlov threatens Patrick McLanahan's friends, bases, crews, aircraft, and son. He tries to make good on this in _Plan of Attack_, but doesn't completely succeed.
-   Played with in the novel _White Plume Mountain_. One of the villains actually says "I'll get you, and your little dog too!", but the dog in question is neither innocent nor helpless. The "dog" is a sentient, fire-breathing hell-hound skin.
-   _The Machineries of Empire_: The Hexarchate, a totalitarian police state, threatens to wipe out the rogue general Cheris's entire ethnic group if she doesn't surrender herself.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Breaking Bad_, Gustavo Fring says to Walt in Season 4 episode ''Crawl Space'':
-   In _Smallville_, even Jor-El does this on occasion due to his Adaptational Villainy. Like in _Arrival_ when he freezes Chloe almost to death. There is also the time in _Splinter_ when he infected Martha with a deadly virus which turns out to be a trick by Brainiac, but Clark totally buys it.
-   Invoked in the second episode of _Frasier_ when Frasier is frustrated at having to share his home with his father, Daphne and Eddie the Jack Russell Terrier.
    
    **Frasier:** Oh, I'll get him for this...and his little dog too!
    
-   The original series of _Black Adder_ has the villainous Witchsmeller Pursuivant burning an innocent old woman as a witch, and her cat on a correspondingly smaller stake. He later sneers in the face of the cat-loving Percy that he burnt "Mistress Scott...and her pussycat!" He gets a spectacular comeuppance, after which Percy wisely comments, "I SAID he shouldn't have burnt that cat..."
-   Rita Repulsa in _Power Rangers_ refused to attack any city other than Angel Grove, despite it being the one city that was protected by a force capable of challenging her. She even said the phrase word-for-word in a Halloween Episode, adding that "I Always Wanted to Say That".
    -   It pretty much becomes the norm for every Power Rangers Big Bad post-In Space.
-   This is the one thing that consistently works on Captain Kirk. In one _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode, Klingons find that torturing Kirk himself is useless, but torturing _Chekov_ snaps him instantly; in another, the Psychopathic Manchild points a gun at _Spock_ to get Kirk to comply. It works. Khan also uses this technique on the entire crew - if he tries to kill all of them together, they will go the heroic way, but he expects better results if he forces the crew to watch Kirk and then Spock get tortured to death.
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_:
    -   In "The Most Toys" when Fajo threatens his minion Varria to force the android Data to comply with his wishes. It works, but that only inspires Varria to turn against Fajo, given that he would kill her over something so trivial. Fajo kills Varria during their escape and threatens to kill more if Data doesn't comply again, but Data reasons perfectly logically that the only way to stop Fajo from doing this is to kill him.
    -   Invoked by Troi in "Face Of The Enemy", when she impersonates Major Rakal of the Tal Shiar, the Romulan Secret Police. Upon pulling rank against Commander Toreth, she tells the crew that anybody who would disobey her would see their families punished, too.
-   In _Supernatural_, people do this to the Winchesters pretty often (in the form of "I'll kill your brother" or Shame If Something Happened), and it's always a bad idea.
-   At one point in _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_, Herc goes into the underworld to visit his family, who were murdered by Hera. With his family is their dog, and on the commentary, Kevin Sorbo notes something like, "You can tell she's evil, she even killed my dog!"
-   In the second season premiere of _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_, a rather enraged Sarkissian attempts to get revenge on the Connors by assaulting their house, car bombing Cameron, and beating the Connors senseless. Sarah and John are unable to resist... until Sarkissian tries to rape Sarah. John _very_ quickly drops all pretenses of Thou Shalt Not Kill, and delivers a highly righteous (if offscreen) ass-kicking.
    -   This is later shown on a flashback.
-   _Buffyverse_:
    
    -   On _Angel_, Daniel Holtz starts out by getting revenge on Angelus - by harassing the _souled_ Angel. Initially, Angel responds with sympathy and guilt with what his soulless self did to the troubled man — and tries to simply reason with him. When Holtz starts to threaten Angel's (innocent) friends, that's when Angel realizes that more drastic action needs to be taken.
    -   In the Angel episode "The House Always Wins", a crooked casino owner enslaved Lorne to exploit his empathic abilities. To get Lorne to cooperate, the man casually shot a random girl to death and threatened to kill more.
    -   On _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, Angelus makes it clear that he intends to kill everyone Buffy cares about also to get back at her for making him feel human.
    -   Angelus did this to _actual_ dogs.
    
    **Buffy:** Skip it. I don't have a puppy, so skip it.
    
    -   In _Buffy_ season 5, Glory at one point explicitly threatens to kill Buffy's friends and family while making Buffy watch, while confronting Buffy in her _own home,_ no less.
    
    **Glory**: I'll kill your mom, I'll kill your friends and I'll make you watch when I do. Just give me the Key. You either have it or you know where to find it. Obviously, this is a one-time-only deal. Next time we meet, something you love dies bloody. You know you can't take me. You know you can't stop me.
    
-   _Glee_ subverts this in this threat from Sue Sylvester:
    
    I will go to the animal shelter and get you a kitty cat. I will let you fall in love with that kitty cat, and then, on some dark, cold night, I will steal away into your home and punch you in the face.
    
-   A recurring tactic of immortals in the _Highlander_ TV series, although there is a practical purpose to it. By destroying the loved ones of their immortal rivals, they hope to cripple their will to live, making them an easier fight (Who Wants to Live Forever?, after all?). Naturally, this can, and has, backfired.
-   In _Heroes_, Sylar gives us this exchange:
    
    **Sylar:** What was your brother's name again? Larry?
    
    **Claire:** Lyle.
    
    **Sylar:** Right, he's gonna die too.
    
-   _Person of Interest_: One of the assassins after the Fixer, they stated to kill her and her driver too. Root uses this trope to ensure Harold's cooperation on two occasions. The first time, she threatens innocent bystanders, the second time she threatens to kill his former fiance.
-   _Scandal_: Becky, Huck's girlfriend, murders the entire family he keeps an eye on. Oh, and she literally killed their dog too.
-   In the season 1 finale of _The Flash (2014)_, the Reverse-Flash threatens to kill Flash's friends and father.
-   _Daredevil (2015)_ proves it really is Darker and Grittier by having the _hero_ do this to the villain. In a desperate attempt to get information out of Wilson Fisk, Matt Murdoch tells Fisk that he can keep his love Vanessa out of the country forever with one letter sent to the right office. Unfortunately, all of the people who could have told Matt how bad of an idea it was to use Vanessa against Fisk are dead. And that is not a coincidence. Fisk basically beats Matt's face in, then delivers his own counter-threat against Matt and his friend Foggy.
-   _Altered Carbon_ provides a rare (anti-)heroic example in episode 4 when Takeshi Kovacs poses as a CTAC officer to frighten his torturers into freeing him:
    
    **Kovavs**: You have _any_ idea what they're gonna do to you? They're gonna hunt you down. All of you. Gonna make what you did to me look like a tropical cruise. They're gonna rip your stacks out and feed them to the shredder. They're gonna kill your families, friends, dogs, cats _and fucking goldfish._ \[...\] The one who lets me up lives. The other two... when the Core is through with you, you won't even be a memory.
    
    -   Played straight when the Hidden Villain is revealed. It's Kovacs sister Reileen, whom he long thought dead. At first he's glad, but she soon drops her facade when her brother refuses to go along with her Evil Plan, pointing out that she could easily have Kovacs friends tortured in virtual reality until they go insane.
-   _Alex Rider_: Duplicate!Alex wants to kill everyone Alex loves as revenge for ruining Dr Greif's plan.
-   _WandaVision_: "Breaking The Fourth Wall" ends with the revelation that friendly neighbor "Agnes" is actually the witch Agatha Harkness. A musical number revealing how she's been secretly manipulating events concludes with her taunting the audience with the news that the killed the Maximoffs' dog in the previous episode.
    
    **Agatha:** And I killed Sparky too! (_Evil Laugh_)
    

    Music 

-   One of Breaking Benjamin's songs, "Home", makes a lot of _The Wizard of Oz_ references, including this line, "cause I’m gonna get you and your little dog too".
-   Averted in the GAYLE song "abcdefu":
    
    _Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off_
    

    Pro Wrestling 

-   BJ Whitmer, to get revenge on CM Punk for knocking him out in a match and then making fun of him as a commentator, naturally took revenge by going after CM Punk, but he _started_ by laying out Punk's girlfriend, Lucy.
-   During their feuds with John Cena, Edge and Randy Orton both targeted Cena's father. Orton did so, twice.
-   The Kings of Wrestling, during their prolonged feud with the Briscoe Brothers, made the mistake of bringing the brothers' father into it by attacking him, making the Briscoes go much further than usual for revenge.

Jasmin would continue to haunt Seleziya in the following weeks, attacking her and taunting her by keeping Peanut _just_ out of her reach, though Sparx ultimately got Peanut back after knocking out Areebi in a ladder match.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Quite literal in the board game expansion of _Kill Doctor Lucky_. Aptly named Kill Doctor Lucky and His Little Dog Too.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: The _Dungeon Master's Guide_ suggests this as a tactic for a DM to develop a campaign setting called "Hitting the PCs Where It Hurts" — having the son of a blacksmith they befriend become kidnapped by slavers, for example, or having a peaceful village they love to visit be in the path of an evil cleric's invading army. It also warns not to overdo the tactic, however, or otherwise the PCs will never grow attached to anything for fear of putting it in danger (the "murderhobo" phenomenon is thought to have originated precisely because of Killer Game Masters doing this too often).

    Toys 

-   Compared to the _Transformers_, humans are tiny, weak, and fragile, but possess heart and guts far beyond their size... which makes the Autobots _extremely_ protective of them. Naturally, the Decepticons just _have_ to pick on the humans instead of quietly sneaking off and conquering a planet the Autobots haven't adopted yet.

    Video Games

-   Judgment Six (J6), the grouping of major corporations behind the worldwide tournaments in the _Virtua Fighter_ series, is responsible for assassinations, blackmail, white-collar theft, and illegal, clandestine Super-Soldier projects, among others. This matters little to fisherman and wrestler Jeffry McWild... until J6 antagonizes him by kidnapping the great white shark that he has been after for at least a decade. Refusing to let anyone else catch the "Great Satan", Jeffry enters the fifth tournament to retrieve his longtime nemesis from J6's clutches.
-   The Big Bad of _The Darkness_ video game (if you don't count the Darkness itself) is a mob boss named Paulie "Kill The Children Too" Franchetti.

-   In _BioShock_, Fontaine threatens to kill all the rescued Little Sisters: "When you're cold and stiff, I'm going over to Mother Goose's house, and I'm going to take it apart, piece-by-piece and brat-by-brat. Consider it your legacy."
    -   Almost goes through with it in _Burial at Sea_. As he's torturing Elizabeth by threatening to give her a transorbital lobotomy there and then (and delivering short taps with an icepick through her eye to show that he means it) she proves herself to be Too Broken to Break and eggs him on, saying that he'd be doing her a favor — he becomes so enraged that he temporarily swings back into his natural Brooklyn accent and has his goons bring in Sally, the Little Sister Elizabeth's been trying to save. He holds the icepick torturously close to Sally's brain and Elizabeth begins shrieking, pleading that she doesn't have the information he wants; a sudden vision of the version of Booker her subconscious created to help her through Rapture via her forgotten memories gives her a clue as to where "the ace in the hole" is, and she tells Fontaine right as he's millimeters away from irreprably damaging Sally's brain.
-   The rifleman from _War Craft III_ will, if you click enough, say "I shot the sheriff...and the deputy...and your

-   Used in, of all things, _Professor Layton and the Unwound Future_, where the Big Bad kidnaps Layton's adopted daughter in order to make absolutely sure that Layton will pursue him. The irony is that Layton, being Layton, would have gone after him anyway — all this trick did was make him _mad_.
-   In _Jade Empire_'s backstory, the Emperor punished his traitorous brother Sun Li by ordering the Lotus Assassins to kill his family. The assassin ordered to do so rebelled halfway through and spared Sun Li's daughter.

-   The Final Boss of _Dragon Age II_ can sometimes grab one of your party members, with a different dialogue snippet for each of them. If they go after Hawke's Love Interest, the speech is aimed at Hawke rather than the victim.

-   _Doom_: At the end of the third episode, Doomguy returns to Earth only to find the cities burning and a rabbit with its head speared on a stake. In the extra chapter, _Thy Flesh Consumed_, it's revealed that this rabbit was Daisy, Doomguy's pet rabbit.

After Sun gives Blake a lecture on how her abandonment of her friends actually causes them more pain than their enemies ever could, Blake's parents reveal the content of the intel Blake and Sun managed to recover from Ilia: that Adam plans to overthrow the White Fang leader, Sienna Khan, and then launch a full-scale assault on Haven Academy, destroying it just as he destroyed Beacon. At this point, Blake finally decides to stop running and begins making plans to take back control of the White Fang from Adam.

    Webcomics 

-   _Axe Cop_ advises people how to defy this when they become crime fighters (which he recommends as the ideal career) — "Your family should hide in the bushes outside your house with guns every night. Because bad guys are always trying to kidnap your family if you are a crime fighter."
-   In _Crimson Dark_, Abraham Mensk makes this threat after losing a battle to Vaegyr Ward. Since Mensk is a loose cannon sociopath, Vaegyr calmly orders the destruction of Mensk's ship. Unfortunately, Mensk is part of a really large organization of revenge-minded Space Pirates.

So basically, And Your Little Dog's Little Dog Too.
-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_: "We will follow you forever.

-   _Weak Hero_:
    -   Forrest Lee's method of taking down Ben, after Jimmy failed to do so, is to target random students at Ben's school and put the blame at Ben's feet, pressuring him into seeking out a fight with Hyeongshin so that the attacks will stop.

    -   Trent does it _again_ in the campaign finale. As the Nein are recuperating in the Blooming Grove he abruptly shows up to try to kill Caleb, which he does by sealing all the doors and windows, then lighting the house on fire with the Nein, Veth's husband and son, and Caduceus's parents, aunt and siblings still inside.

    Western Animation 

-   This one of several things that consistently provokes the Avatar State in the normally sweet and pacifist Aang in _Avatar: The Last Airbender_. In the first episode of season two, some unnamed Earth Kingdom general _tries_ to provoke Avatar State by sinking Katara in rock, which turns out to be a bad idea. Appa is also a frequent target.
