_"DON'T GET ME WRONG, I'M NOT RACIST OR ANYTHING. SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE HUMAN. BUT IF THEY'RE AS GOOD AS US, WHY DO THEY NEED SKIN? AM I RIGHT?"_

Alice accuses Bob of discriminating against/being prejudiced towards group X, and Bob denies it, by pointing out "Some of my best friends are X's". Usually played for Hypocritical Humor, as if having friends of a particular racial/ethnic group makes them not racist. Said friends are rarely ever present to speak for themselves and, therefore, can neither defend nor criticize whatever it was that earned Bob the accusation of prejudice. Besides, being a member of group X _yourself_ will not necessarily preclude your being prejudiced against group X.

Note though that this trope depends on its use as a _defense_ against an accusation. If Bob simply says "I have many friends who are X", but is not using it as a defense, then it may not be this trope. It may just be that he's saying so because another person says they've never seen many people of that group, so Bob saying that he has friends in that group is just meant to point out he knows some. The use of this phrase as a defense against bigotry has been lampooned so many times that un-ironically using it in Real Life is usually construed as _ipso facto_ evidence of racism.

Often a response to Mistaken for Racist. Related to You Are a Credit to Your Race and Bigotry Exception, and often accompanied by Not That There's Anything Wrong with That. It may also be used to (dubiously) claim N-Word Privileges for using a slur that's considered derogatory when it comes from outsiders.

If Bob actually _does_ have some friends from the group he's racist towards, he may be a Noble Bigot. If he genuinely doesn't understand why they might take objection to something he says, he's possibly an Innocent Bigot. Either way, he likely does not comprehend that his minority friends are being more generous in putting up with his racism than he is in overlooking his prejudice.

An Undead Horse Trope that may be depressingly difficult to put down. See the Analysis page for more information.

Can also involve Boomerang Bigots—(e.g. "Some of my best friends are white!" - Self-Hating White Guy) or bizarre character circumstances (e.g. "Some of my best friends are werewolves!" - Werewolf-Hating Vampire). See also Have You Tried Not Being a Monster?, Fantastic Racism and Fantastic Aesop. Supertrope to Token Black Friend.

Note that this is not the same as saying "Some of my best friends are X" in the context of expressing knowledge and familiarity with the group in question. Example: "Yes, I'm familiar with Jewish customs. I have many close Jewish friends".

    Comedy

-   Sean Lock pokes fun at this trope during a stand-up routine:
    
    "It's a nonsensical argument if you think about it, 'I'm not racist, I've got black friends.' You might as well argue 'I'm not a murderer, some of my best friends are alive!' And if you try arguing 'I'm not a pedophile, some of my best friends are kids!' you'll probably make things worse for yourself."
    
-   Subverted in an Imran Yusuf joke: "Some people get annoyed at me for making jokes about the situation in Israel and Palestine, they accuse me of being an antisemite for making jokes criticizing Israel. I always tell them, 'You know who my best friend at school was? He's a _real_ antisemite, I'm an absolute amateur compared to him!'"

-   _Denial_: Irving uses a more-clueless-than-usual version of this when he argues that he can't be racist because he employs black and Asian servants, saying that "some of them have very beautiful breasts." The dumbfounded reporter has to ask him to repeat that.
    -   Deconstructed in the book on the case when Irving tries to argue that Hitler wasn't anti-Semitic because he had a Jewish chauffeur.

-   _Catch-22_, for the purpose of satire:
    
    **Colonel Cathcart:** Do you really think it's a good idea to let the enlisted men in?  
    **The Chaplain:** I should think it only proper, sir.  
    **Cathcart:** I'd like to keep them out. Oh, don't get me wrong, Chaplain. It isn't that I think the enlisted men are dirty, common and inferior. It's that we just don't have enough room. Frankly, though, I'd just as soon the officers and enlisted men didn't fraternize in the briefing room. They see enough of each other during the mission, it seems to me. Some of my very best friends are enlisted men, you understand, but that's as close as I care to let them come close. Honestly now, Chaplain, you wouldn't want your sister to marry an enlisted man, would you?  
    **Chaplain:** My sister _is_ an enlisted man, sir.
    
-   Happens literally in _The Emperor's Coloured Coat_ by John Biggins.

-   Friday says this when Georges Perreault mentions that he's a genetic engineer, involved in the creation of Artificial Persons.

The irony is that (unknown to Georges at the time) Friday is an AP herself, posing as a normal human.

    -   His liberal son-in-law Mike turns out to not be much better. While he's very friendly and sociable to the Bunkers' black neighbor Lionel, the only things he ever talks to him about are race politics and civil rights developments. Lionel reveals in one episode that it makes him feel that Mike considers him just a representative of the black community he can talk about issues with rather than a real friend (Archie on the other hand at least treats Lionel like an individual).

Uh, black PEOPLE, I mean, seeing as I ain't a fag or anything. But yeah, rap music? I am SO down with that shit! Snoop Dogg? Man, what an awesome guy! I must have, what, six friends who are black? Seven if you count Indian guys... Do Indian guys count as being black? I mean, I know they're kind of brown-ish, but... I dunno.

-   One of Ghost's many catchphrases. "I am not a racist. I am a melting pot of friendship, and I want you to amplify that all over the internets. I happen to have a whole bunch of friends that _happen to be black_. I happen to have a whole bunch of friends that happen to be Hi_spandex_. Oriental, kraut, camel jockey..." And so on.
-   Roger Woddis of the Silent Majority on _John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme_:
    
    **Woddis**: Now I have nothing against the gays. Really, nothing at all. Some of my best fr... _one_ of my best friends has a son who thinks he's gay, and I can honestly say I think none the worse of him for it. My friend, I mean. I never liked the son much anyway.

    Video Games 

-   _Portal 2_ inverts this - when the best insult the power-mad Wheatley can come up with is "Fatty-fatty no-parents", GLaDOS replies "What exactly is wrong with being adopted?" Cue Wheatley mumbling that "Some of my best friends are orphans" while trying to regain control of the conversation.
    -   Even funnier? GLaDOS then claims it IS terrible that Chell is adopted, but to just go with it.
-   Used to an extent (minus the actual phrase) in _Mass Effect 2_ when Grunt realizes he hates turians. Shepard's Renegade response is to threaten him that he'd better not start anything with Garrus. Grunt basically responds that he hates turians in general but not Garrus specifically.
-   _Psychonauts_: In Waterloo World, Raz has to try to convince a peasant to join Fred Bonaparte's army, the peasant refuses, saying that Fred doesn't care about the people, to which Raz answers: "What? Fred cares about the people, in fact, some of his best friends are... the people?"

-   One NPC in _LEGO DC Super-Villains_ can be heard saying this:
    
    "It's not like I'm anti-Justice League or anything. Some of my best friends are in the Justice League. You've heard of (unintelligible mumbling), right?"
    
-   A supplemental lore example from _League of Legends_: during Sylas' mage uprising in Demacia, he captures Prince Jarvan IV and puts on an impromptu "trial" accusing him of being complicit in Demacia's reign of oppression against all mages. Jarvan pleads in his defence that he even loved someone (implied to be Shyvana the Half-Dragon) "not so different from all of you", but Sylas was far from impressed.
-   In _Far Cry 5_ there's a note found in a cabin in which the author complains of all the drugs and chemicals the cult is pumping into the environment which are causing the animals to become gay which is "unnatural" in his own words.

    Web Comics 

-   Parodied in a strip of _League of Super Redundant Heroes_, where an extra-galactic visitor can confuse even Starfish Aliens with humans, and then try to pretend that some of his best friends are from the Milky Way galaxy.
-   Tip, _Skin Horse_'s Token Human, suffering a bit of culture shock at the transgenic convention, says that it's a relief to see another human, before hastily adding "Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are non-human. All of them, really." Which would be awkward enough, except he's talking to Artie Narbon.
    
    **Tip:** ...and you're not human, are you?  
    **Artie:** Nope.  
    **Tip:** And now you think I'm a big old speciesist.  
    **Artie:** But, as you said, a good-looking one.
    
-   A more sensible variant in _Kill Six Billion Demons_: Vigilant Gaze says this about humans in _their_ defense, rather than his own. Specifically, when he hears some other angels badmouthing humans and White Chain for identifying with them, he chides them by saying that he's known and befriended plenty of good humans and that it's unfair to judge them all for what their leaders — the Demiurges — did to Throne (i.e., turning it into a dystopian hellhole).

-   In _Epic Rap Battles of History_, Frank Sinatra is portrayed as a product of his times, for better or for worse, and as such filled his first verse with barbs regarding Freddie Mercury's bisexuality. When Mercury responded by mocking Sinatra's Italian heritage, Ol' Blue Eyes didn't take it well and felt the need to clarify that he didn't have anything against bisexuals in general. The way he worded it, though...
-   Kirito in _Sword Art Online Abridged_ says this when asked about sacrificing NPCs but is quickly subverted when an NPC named Gary speaks up. Kirito gets upset because, in episode 3, Gary teleported away with all the teleport crystals and left Kirito's team to die. Kirito proceeds to kill Gary off-screen in revenge.
    
    **Kirito:** ''Whoa, whoa, whoa! We can't just go around sacrificing NPCs! Some of my best friends have been NPCs!  
    **Asuna:** That makes way too much sense.  
    **Gary, off-screen:** We must save my family!  
    **Kirito:** Ya see?! Some of them even have faaaaaaaa... \*Whispered\* Gary... 'Scuse me. I have to go say hi to an old friend. Won't be a minute.

    **Rainer Wolfcastle:** We have so much to discuss.
    
-   In _The Transformers,_ Sunstreaker called humans inferior and Bumblebee responded: "Some of my best friends are humans." Of course, he actually _does_ like humans. Spike thanked him, but it's still not much of a defense.
-   _Gargoyles_: Parodied and mixed with Overly Narrow Superlative when Fang thought Demona was about to shoot him.
    
    **Fang:** Some of my best friends are half-human-half-gargoyle babes with bad attitudes.
    
-   In _Ben 10_, Ben's cousin Lucy is a member of a race of Blob Monster aliens known as the Leopans, who the older Plumbers had a history of conflict with and referred to as "sludge puppies".

-   _Robot Chicken_: One sketch has the Duke boys discussing race relations. One insists that he is more tolerant because he has exactly one black acquaintance while his brother has none. His brother points out that his dark-skinned friend is Guatemalan, not African-American, so he doesn't actually have any black friends either.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
