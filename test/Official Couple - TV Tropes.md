So official, it's the game's logo.

_"Oh fuck it. Who am I to stand between you two? You obviously make an adorable couple. Why should I let my rotten luck with the ladies rain on your parade. That's it, I'm calling it. I'm declaring your ship to be officially canon."_

This is when the main characters in any given story are undeniably a couple. (Thus, in heroic stories The Hero and the token girl are the usual couple, though it isn't always them.) The important thing to know about this trope is that the characters are overtly paired off, so even if they never kiss on screen or even flirt with other characters, it's understood by the cast (and hopefully the audience) that the two are an item. Naturally, this does absolutely nothing to offset Shipping.

Sometimes, there's another couple that sometimes serves as a Foil and/or companion to the "official" couple that involves The Hero. This other couple usually involves The Lancer and a minor female. This couple is called the Beta Couple.

Sub-Trope of Love Interests.

Expect: She Is Not My Girlfriend, Just Friends, Everyone Can See It, Like Brother and Sister, and Lampshade Hanging.

If this trope breaks up a Fan-Preferred Couple, expect Ship-to-Ship Combat to ensue.

Side-Story Bonus Art often has the couple getting married. Speaking of which, if this the path that the couple ends up taking, it is very likely to fall under being Happily Married.

See also Love Chart. Contrast Better as Friends for when this devolves into a platonic relationship, and One True Pairing and Fan-Preferred Couple for when fans have a preferred ship that they want to become an official couple. If the plot tortures the official couple, then that's Official Couple Ordeal Syndrome.

**A REMINDER:** A couple is an official couple only if they acknowledge their feelings and enter into a relationship in Canon. Ship Teasing and Unresolved Sexual Tension do not count, nor does your favorite Fan Fic or Doujinshi. _Do not use this page as a proxy for Ship-to-Ship Combat._

    -   While mostly having a reputation for slash, the TGWTG fangirl fandom _adored_ former real-life pairings Linkara/Iron Liz and Spoony/Scarlett. There's also a "that's so adorable!" Squee over Doug getting engaged to his girlfriend.
    -   While both couples have since broken up, for a time there was JesuOtaku / Nash and The Nostalgia Chick/Todd in the Shadows. The latter one's layered: Lindsay and Todd were dating in real life, but in-character The Nostalgia Chick pursues Todd in the Shadows, who brushed her off and pined for / stalked Allison Pregler aka Lupa, who is in a relationship with Phelous as well.
    -   Regarding Chick, Lindsay and Doug confirmed in the _FernGully: The Last Rainforest_ commentary that all of her Ship Tease with The Nostalgia Critic was intentional and that the characters had an ambiguous-on-details-but-very-real thing going on.
    -   Doug gave his approval for Critic and Snob to be labelled "Internet Reviewer Boyfriends".
    -   Hyper Fangirl and Devil Boner (lovingly named Hyper-Boner) are Ax-Crazy Sickeningly Sweethearts that bond over who kidnapped Critic best.
