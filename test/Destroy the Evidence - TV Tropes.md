**Arnold:** But the document! Where's the document?  
**Scheck:** Unfortunately, like your little plan, it's about to go up in smoke.

Bob has come into possession of some evidence relating to a crime. However, instead of turning this evidence over to the proper authorities, he destroys (or withholds/hides) the evidence.

Why? Well, there's a number of reasons. For instance:

-   The evidence could incriminate someone who Bob likes and doesn't want to see punished.
-   The evidence, if made public, will ruin the life of someone who's otherwise involved in the crime, like a victim or a witness.
-   Bob is being blackmailed by the Big Bad or an associate.
-   Bob himself would be incriminated by the evidence.
-   The evidence contains information which would exonerate another villain who is on trial for another crime.
-   The evidence, if involving a dead person, might cast a bad light on their memory — and Bob was a good friend/relative/lover of the dead person.
-   The evidence is entirely worthless — it's too late to act.
-   Bob wants to punish the bad guy himself.
-   While the evidence could get the bad guy put away or otherwise punished, it would cause scandals and create chaos for a lot of people, some of whom may be entirely innocent.
-   The evidence would reveal an ugly truth about a past event that the public perceives as a good thing, and Bob wants the event to _stay_ a good thing.
-   The criminal committed the crime for a good reason, and in retrospect, Bob agrees that the act was justified.
-   The crime involved the murder of someone who was a truly terrible person, and Bob doesn't want the evidence revealed since it would result in someone going to prison for something he doesn't think of as a crime.
-   Bob is currently on the run or at least not on good terms with the local authorities, so he can't give the evidence to them without being captured/killed/arrested.
-   Bob is eventually revealed to be the villain.
-   Bob believes that the criminal is genuinely repentant and need not be punished further.

Whatever good intentions Bob may have had, destroying the evidence will probably have bad results — a villain could walk free, for instance, or a good guy might be implicated. May result in a What the Hell, Hero?, given Bob is the hero.

In others, a Villain with Good Publicity may destroy any evidence that can be used to arrest/implicate them in a crime or a horrific event.

-   _Downton Abbey_: When Bates is under suspicion of Green's murder, Lady Mary finds a train ticket in his coat pocket that could link him to the scene of the crime, and, after a brief Sudden Principled Stand, burns it to protect him.

-   In _Veronica Mars_, Logan comes into possession of the sex tapes of his girlfriend and his father, and he destroys them so they wouldn't be seen in court and ruin Lilly's memory.
-   In one episode of _NCIS_, Gibbs switches tissue samples so that it will appear that a body they're trying to identify was that of a dead Marine- the Marine (who is dead) had had a kidney transplant from a friend, who was still alive. Because you can't be a Marine if at some point in your life you donated an organ, the Marine, if this became known, would have to quit- which he _really_ didn't want to do.

-   In any season of _The Dukes of Hazzard_, the phrase "The boys got off because there wasn't any evidence" is about guaranteed to occur in at least a third of the episodes.

-   _Breaking Bad_: The first episode of season five has Walt realizing he still has lots of loose ends to tie up. He starts off by throwing away all the stuff he used to make the bomb that killed Gus and then also dumps the potted lily-of-the-valley plant he used to poison Brock. Then he realizes he has a much bigger problem; the Superlab had numerous security cameras recording his every move while he was working for Gus, and Gus' laptop with all the incriminating footage was confiscated by the DEA. Walt, Jesse, and Mike then spend the rest of the episode trying to find a way to destroy the laptop before anyone watches the footage and discovers their involvement, which they manage to accomplish to do with a giant electromagnet. Unfortunately for them, this ends up accidentally revealing the bank account numbers, which had been hidden in a photo frame, that Gus had been using to pay his employees...

Luckily, some pieces of evidence survived, sufficient to put her and her rogue doctors and ex-con orderlies away for a long time.

Much later in the episode, it's revealed to be _four_ dirty cops: his boss, Lieutenant Shell, was the leader of the operation, and following the bust hours after a party following a baseball game Sage City officers competed in with the Rangers, Glenn gave him the original copies of the evidence the following morning, but instead of taking those photos to internal affairs, Shell likely destroyed them before tipping off the three detectives that got busted, and then planted the stolen drugs from that previous bust in Glenn's locker, framing him and his partner (who was then murdered by the trio) for their crime. It's quickly subverted with the additional copies of those photos Glenn hid at a library: Gage and Sydney retrieved them first and arrested the trio before they could get them. One of the detectives then promptly confesses Lt. Shell's involvement in the case, upon which he and his two partners are indicted for killing Glenn's partner and almost killing Sage County District Attorney Clark, and while Gage, Sydney and Trivette arrest Chick Winslow, Lt. Shell went on to commit suicide at his home before his boss and Walker could arrest him.

Doing so will get you the Accomplice ending, which is right up there with killing Namatame when it comes to Downer Endings.

    Visual Novels 

-   Done multiple times in the _Ace Attorney_ series, usually by the defendants. Often they're trying to protect someone they care about from incrimination, even at the cost of their own freedom:
    -   Late in Case 1-4, Manfred von Karma destroys most of the critical evidence you have but fails to get the bullet from the DL-6 Incident, which leads to his undoing. He even says that his accomplice, Yanni Yogi, should have burned the letter he received.
    -   In case 1-5, Lana Skye deliberately distorted evidence relating to the SL-9 incident- wiping the blood off of pottery fragments, which apparently spell the name "EMA" partially in order to get Joe Darke convicted, but mainly to prevent her sister from being charged with murder. Later, Phoenix doesn't want to present a certain piece of evidence(Ema's handprint, which was cut out of the victim's vest) for the same reason - it implicates someone he doesn't want to see get in trouble. He does present it later when it becomes the key piece of evidence to implicate the guilty party, who is the only one who could have known about its significance and removed it.
    -   Phoenix Wright himself does this in 3-1 by eating Dahlia's locket.
    -   Special mention to Detective Badd in _Ace Attorney Investigations_ who destroyed evidence relating to the Yatagarasu. As head of the investigation he was in a perfect position to make sure no traces were ever found at the crime scene. Why? He _was_ a member of the Yatagarasu.
    -   In _Dual Destinies_, the Phantom goes as far as _bombing a courthouse_ in order to destroy a moon rock hidden inside evidence for an ongoing case because said moon rock had his blood on it.

-   _Danganronpa_
    -   In _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_, the first culprit ends up with bloody clothes after committing a murder with a knife, and has to dispose of them, so the incinerator seems like the best bet. Unfortunately, the incinerator is locked behind a steel grate. So what does the culprit do? He pitches a glass crystal ball at the button to activate the incinerator, then balls up his shirt and throws it in, too. Unfortunately for him, the burned sleeve of his shirt falls off, leaving behind enough evidence to prove his guilt.
    -   In the second case of the first game, the culprit destroys the victim's notepad by throwing it into a sauna. It's implied that this was partly to cover up his crime and partly to hide the victim's true gender.

-   _Girl Genius_: Merlot learns that Agatha is a Heterodyne after he has her expelled and then can't track her down because she's already in the Baron's custody. His panicked reaction is to slaughter the Baron's researchers who uncovered this and then _burn down the university buildings_ where the records had been found to try an hide his mistake. Murdering a bunch of the Baron's employees and burning university buildings is of course a far worse "mistake" and the next time Merlot is seen he's been imprisoned in Castle Heterodyne.

    Real Life 

-   In war or during public turmoil, it is standard procedure for militaries and governments to burn their own sensitive documents just before they can fall into enemy hands. Real Life examples include Iran's US embassy workers shredding intelligence material immediately before they were overrun by the angry mob in 1980, or the Wehrmacht burning orders and records whenever they were forced to retreat in the later stages of WW2.
-   There's one dashcam footage where police arrest a man for possession of drugs. They place the man and the small baggie of drugs near each other on the trunk and, with no one looking, the man reaches over, grabs it with his teeth and _swallows_ it. It takes police a few moments to realize what the guy had done...
-   In some circumstances it is possible to forensically examine burnt paper and read what was written on it. If all you've got is ash, it is presumably still utterly impossible. Similar techniques are being used in ancient archaeology to "read" fire-damaged papyrus scrolls recovered from Pompeii's post-volcanic ruins.
-   As portrayed on _Forensic Files_, Air Force sergeant Joseph Snodgrass was being interrogated for his wife's death; he managed to sneak in a pair of pinking shears, and before anyone could stop him, he cut up a floppy disk containing incriminating information. After several agencies told the investigators it would take millions of dollars to repair, one man offered what would be a $100 solution: Scotch tape. _It worked._<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In many jurisdictions, destroying evidence is a crime. In the United States, both states and the federal government have laws against this; however said laws requires both intent and knowledge that the evidence would be incriminating. A mob boss destroying papers detailing his tax fraud or a Corrupt Corporate Executive burning evidence of embezzlement could be prosecuted. A janitor shredding or burning such documents as part of their job would not be.
-   There is legal precedent for the police seizing evidence in advance of a search warrant being signed/delivered to the site of the search if they have good reason to believe that a suspect will seek to destroy it, specifically to prevent said destruction from happening. That said, the police would still not be permitted to examine or use the evidence until the signed warrant arrives.
