_"I don't care that you think that my coming out was gonna be a big thing, Martin. Look, you don't get to decide that. **I'm** supposed to be the one that decides when and where and how and who knows and how I get to say it — that's supposed to be **my** thing! And you took that away from me."_

A variation on the Coming-Out Story where a Closet Gay is outed, but not by their own choice. Usually it's the actions of another person who either inadvertently or purposefully outs them. Sometimes the outer has good intentions and believes that it's for the character's own good, while other times it's good old blackmail or simple Jerkassery. The one doing the outing is almost always straight and/or cisgender, meaning they have no experience with being in the closet themselves and fail to realize how important willingly outing yourself once you're ready is to someone and why taking the chance to do so away is so devastating. For worse, often the person who does the outing was the very first person the closeted character ever told the truth to, which makes the betrayal extra potent. Expect the character who did the outing to get called out on it by either the character they outed or others who understand how serious this is.

Originally, involuntary outing was used as a method of protest by LGBT activists who noted that certain political and cultural figures who were closeted homosexuals still voted on anti-gay legislation or supported those who did. The outing of such figures was often referred to as being acceptable under "The Frank Rule" after openly gay Representative Barney Frank, who applied it to (mostly Republican) politicians. Outing such figures exposed their hypocrisy and also proved that homosexuality was normal and common across political persuasions. While such public and politically powerful figures are still widely considered fair game, merely being in the closet is not.

Among real-life LGBT people, outing someone who's not ready is considered very bad form, especially since it can literally endanger someone's life, making it often overlap with Kick the Dog, with the reaction being magnified significantly if the person forced out of the closet is a minor. Being forced out of the closet will come hand in hand with Gayngst. See also Trans Tribulations and Intersex Tribulations.

Whilst this kind of storyline can be well used for creating drama and imparting morals, if not done well it may alienate an LGBT Fanbase, especially if it's either Played for Laughs or isn't treated with the seriousness it deserves.

It is sometimes seen as a specific type of Homophobic Hate Crime.

See also Out of the Closet, Into the Fire, when people face terrible hardships after coming out (which is obviously made much worse if they were forced out). Compare and contrast Coax Them Out of the Closet, where someone asks for the person to out _themselves_ consensually.

When given the chance to claim it was a joke and strongly encouraged to do so by the superior officer who confronted her about it so she could stay, Kate instead came out rather than lie and was separated from the military.

-   One of the issues of _All-New X-Men_ has Young!Jean Grey reading the mind of Young!Bobby Drake, discovering from this that he's gay, and not-so-subtly forcing Young Bobby to out himself as gay, which also forces the older Bobby to do so as well (and thus pulling a Retcon of Bobby's constant womanizing for all of these years as his attempts to get The Beard).

    Visual Novels 

-   _C14 Dating_ has an accidental case that ranges from consequence-free to an outright positive outcome. If Melissa makes the right choices during the festival, she will enter the museum while a visitor is flirting with Hendrik. Hendrik's close friend Rosemarie, who is watching the conversation from a distance, makes a few comments about Hendrik being oblivious to the flirting and lets the word "ace" (which can be short for "asexual") slip before suddenly acting like she said something she shouldn't have. When Melissa asks if she was about to say "ace geologist" (a nickname Rosemarie was once seen giving Hendrik, who is very passionate about his geologist job), Rosemarie claims it was indeed the case. After Rosemarie ends their conversation, Melissa turns out to have actually perfectly understood the piece of information Rosemarie let slip. If the player gets to the point where the character comes out to Melissa himself, he finds out that she already knows because of the event above. He also realizes that Melissa had that knowledge on hand when she accepted to go on a date with him and said knowledge is not keeping her from having enough romantic interest in him to give a Long-Distance Relationship a shot. For that reason, he decides to forgive the person who let the information slip.

Despite what Ari thinks, absolutely nobody cares if she's gay, and are mostly accepting of her, aside from Coach Colby and his Straight Club, who plan on _burning Ari's house to the ground_.

He was extremely mad at her for this for years afterward and was especially pissed that his own parents found out after overhearing people talking about it at the grocery store.
    -   And Nanase's mother bursts into her hospital room and sees her kissing Ellen. In an aversion, Nanase's mother really doesn't care — she thinks it's a phase.

She still would have probably preferred to decide _how_ she told her mom.
    -   Sam is a trans man, but a previous attempt to come out as a lesbian (which ended very badly) has made him very unwilling to share this with anyone.

-   Lavali from _Sandra on the Rocks_ is forced to come out to her brother Alex after he walks in on her and her girlfriend angrily breaking up. Actually Played for Laughs, since while this may have been a surprising reveal to the _readers_, as far as Alex and their parents are concerned, she's been in the world's most Transparent Closet for _years_. As in, they've all caught her naked with other girls several times, which she attempted to explain away with laughably flimsy excuses.
-   In _Sleepless Domain_, only girls can get magical powers, so Zoe's family thought they wouldn't need to worry about another of their children having to fight monsters every night up until the call came knocking.

-   During a 1982 interview with _Us_ magazine, Johnny Mathis offhandedly mentioned that "Homosexuality is a way of life that I've grown accustomed to." The quote was meant to be off the record but was published anyway without his consent, resulting in death threats that kept him silent about his sexuality for a long time. It wasn't until 2017, 35 years later, that he confirmed that he was gay on his own terms.
-   During production of _X-Men: The Last Stand_, nearly a decade before Elliot Page publicly came out as gay in 2014 (and later as a queer trans man in 2020), director Brett Ratner would reveal Page as gay to the crew, down to telling a woman to "fuck \[him\] to make \[him\] realize \[he is\] gay", which Page would later say was very uncomfortable.
-   A veteran Marine of the Vietnam War named Oliver Sipple saved President Gerald Ford from an assassination attempt in 1975, and soon after Harvey Milk outed him to the media. Interestingly enough Milk was gay himself, but he thought outing Sipple would dispel the stereotype of gay men being cowardly. Unfortunately, Sipple hadn't come out to his parents yet and, as a result of this, they disowned him to his face. He ended up drinking himself to death in 1989 at the age of 47.
-   George Michael bore the brunt of this after his 1998 arrest for public lewdness (he tried to solicit an undercover cop for sex).
