All part of a balanced diet.

The Madness-Induced Omnivore is a character who is suffering from some degree of delusion, delirium, Sanity Slippage, or is completely off their rocker, and for whom one of the symptoms of their mental issue(s) is a desire or compulsion to eat abnormally. This can range from eating things that are technically edible but are far outside the norm for their diet, such as insects, all the way to trying to eat non-food items like rocks or metallic objects. Strange, unsettling mannerisms can accompany this drive, such as a degradation of personality or belief that there's a connection to what they're consuming. If insects or other animals are eaten, they're usually eaten raw and in a crude or even animalistic manner. This can have a markedly negative effect on their health, and is often portrayed as being shocking or disturbing to those who see the character doing the consuming.

Extreme hunger can also cause this, and in a comedic work it can be Played for Laughs, often being combined with Meat-O-Vision. Can overlap with Extreme Omnivore, Eat Dirt, Cheap, or Metal Muncher, especially in comedic instances. On the other hand, taking this to a horrific extreme can lead to the character attempting to feed on people. However, that trope should be used for such examples.

Related to Crazy Consumption (eating normal foods in a very odd way) and Too Desperate to Be Picky (eating things you normally wouldn't out of desperation rather than insanity). Can overlap with Horror Hunger, although in that case the drive to eat odd things is the focal point of their madness and is usually ravenous, insatiable, and all-consuming (so to speak).

Note that cultural differences can affect how this presents. For instance, people in some Asian and African countries wouldn't bat an eye at eating insects, but in many Western countries this would be seen as very odd, especially if the insects weren't cooked first. Also, pica is a medical condition where a person feels a compulsion to eat non-foodstuffs.
