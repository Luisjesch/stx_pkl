_"Lay down your load,  
We are only down the road.  
We have no gifts but we are many, and we'll do  
Anything for you."_

—The villagers, **Encanto**, "All Of You"

An Ending Trope. Some stories of a more "feel-good" persuasion end with the characters volunteering to improve their community. Often they will be repairing damage done during the climax and characters previously at conflict will be seen working together. Some works portray this with a single scene, others with a Montage.

This gives the main characters the manpower to quickly wrap up the story and avert the cliché where The Main Characters Do Everything. It also implies that characters are overcoming the events of the story and acts as an extra feelgood aesop about the power of teamwork and societal changes that can be enacted when people come together. If the community was not on their side for most of the story, their participation here also likely signals a turning point in their support of the main characters.

This is perhaps most common in animation, which has historically been more kid-friendly and optimistic than live-action films. You can also expect it in a Christmas Special, Christmas Episode, or Christmas movies due to the focus on peace and good cheer in those works.

This applies to a non-violent resolution in the Dénouement. So, when many characters come together in the climax to resolve the plot through a liberal application of punching or fire, that is not this trope.

A classic sub-trope of Happy Ending. Compare Hard-Work Montage and Recovery Sequence, which focus more on the intensity of the labor than the unity of those involved and doesn't need to come after the climax. If done poorly, it can easily verge into Sweetness Aversion territory.

## This is an Ending Trope, so expect unmarked spoilers!
