_"Whoever put her together made her a little too realistic... Who wants a weapon that sulks!?"_

Robots in television — particularly comedic television — are usually human-like in ways that very few sane programmers would deem useful. It can be something as simple as being philosophical (wanting to understand human emotion, wondering if they have a soul, etc.), but can extend to such things as robot social cliques, robot food, robot entertainment, robot religion, and even robot sex. It doesn't matter if it makes no sense in the context of a mechanical servant, or even if it's truly undesirable, the designers have put it in there for some twisted reason. This will often take the form of having a robot that looks, "thinks" (or at least processes input) and behaves _exactly_ like a human.

The degree to which this is actually "ridiculous" varies depending on the setting. In some cases they get a free pass — it may be that an intelligence, artificial or not, _needs_ to be vaguely human-like in its basic outlines, with emotions, interests, motivations, et cetera simply to be functional for certain tasks, such as those requiring a great deal of long-term autonomy. It may be that robots _need_ to think like humans to understand human concepts such as ethics and morality, and thus refrain from — to quote Dwarf Fortress players — Fun activities such as trying to turn all matter in the Universe into paperclips. It may be, if human intelligence itself is merely an evolved set of functions held together in an evolved psychological architecture, that any society with sufficiently ubiquitous and flexible automation will necessarily have the means to produce something human-like. It may be that emotions, desires, and curiosity are unavoidable side-effects of full sentience, or it may simply be that humans prefer Sexbots to not behave like automated teller machines. Whatever serves the needs of the well-reasoned plot or setting. In these cases, Ridiculously Human Robots make sense.

However, it's rare that a series explicitly spells this out, as, ultimately, most authors and worldbuilders adopt this trope because a few illogical design choices are a small price to pay for keeping robotic characters out of the creepy Uncanny Valley. In fact, these human-like AIs are often put right up next to similar, yet seemingly emotionless equivalents that function perfectly.

A corollary to this is that robots are comfortable in their own oddball version of society, and consider human conventions and practices bizarre and silly. You'd think they would be programmed to be familiar with human behavior, and find it perfectly normal. Robots from places without humans, who are exempt from this complaint, curiously tend to adapt to human customs faster.

Tin Can Robots cannot by definition have a Ridiculously Human Appearance like some examples, but may fit on the "Ridiculously Human Personality" part of the equation.

For an alternative, see Pick Your Human Half. Interestingly, there will usually be at least one character (or society in general) who insists it's "Just a Machine".

See also Instant A.I.: Just Add Water!, Super-Powered Robot Meter Maids, Fembot, Ridiculously Alive Undead, and Robot Girl. Compare and contrast with Artificial Human, Robot Me, or Mechanical Lifeforms. The more human-like ones are sometimes an Eating Machine and may indulge in Robo Romance. May become subject to a Robotic Reveal if the robot looks ridiculously human enough to pass as one. Expect the reveal to have some squick if it's done via means like an Unusual User Interface. Contrast Deceptively Human Robots, for when the apparent humanity is only skin deep. Also contrast Mechanical Monster, where it is completely inhuman in both psychology and appearance. The inverse on nearly every level of Cybernetics Will Eat Your Soul. Contrast Forgot He Was a Robot and Starfish Robots.

## Other examples

    open/close all folders 

    Asian Animation 

-   The robots in _Happy Heroes_ act more like humans than anything, to the point that the only thing really distinguishing them from the actual humans is 1. their appearance (sometimes), and 2. the fact that some robots, including the heroes themselves, like to drink oil.

    Fan Works 

-   _A Dip In The Inkwell_: The oneshot "Powering Down for the Night" focuses on one of Oona's Oonabots, who assisted her in an _Odd Squad_ Training Video covering the repair of Oonabots. Said Oonabot gives herself the name "Ona", acts like a Mama Bear to Oscar's own twenty-five Oscarbots, and generally acts more human than the other two Oonabots.
-   _Invader Zim: A Bad Thing Never Ends_: Between their state of the art AI and their Hard Light disguises to make them look human, Aldrich Coathanger's Mecha-Mooks are virtually indistinguishable from normal people.
-   In _Marionettes_, it turns out that Trixie turns out to be one, as does Lightning Dust and Diamond Tiara, something they were unaware of. Justified as they seem to have been created to imitate ponies on purpose.
-   In _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, Ash's Pokédex starts out with a very special personality, which only seems to grow more and more human as the story progresses.

-   _There Was Once an Avenger From Krypton_:
    -   Life Model Decoys are confirmed to exist in this universe, having been invented by Howard Stark after the Kennedy assassination, but with the concept eventually being abandoned due to how prone the LMDs are to breaking down as a result of their complexity. Doctor Doom later stole some and perfected the tech to create his Doombots.
    -   Jenny Wakeman also exists in this universe, and the reason that she's so much more advanced than her "sisters" is that she's actually a Cluster superweapon that Nora stole before Vexus could activate her.

    Manhua 

-   Milan from _My Beloved Mother_, who serves as the robot mother of the Raised by Robots protagonist Sinbell, behaves way more like a human than a robot, including having emotions and compassion (at one point telling Sinbell "you came from mommy's tummy!" after Sinbell tries asking where he's from) despite her mechanical exterior. The Unrobotic Reveal at the end sheds some light behind her origin - it turns out Sinbell's biological mother, Aya, gave up her life to save him from a gas explosion, and before she dies, request for her mind to be transferred into an android, the prototype caretaker Milan.

    Manhwa 

-   From _Metal Heart_ Sia and the other EA units. They think they are the characters from the game and don't even know that they themselves are robots.

    Music 

-   Janelle Monáe's Metropolis is based around an android named Cindi Mayweather who falls in love with a human.
-   KILROY of The Protomen is so human-like you'd swear he was wearing a mask.
    -   Wait...
-   Doctor Steel has a robot band. Which malfunction on his Propaganda DVD, but finally work in his video for "Childhood Don't A-Go-Go". At least in miniature...
-   _Vocaloid_ is a series of computer programs meant to imitate human voices, and the general consensus is that in-universe they qualify as these. It doesn't help that their personality varies with their song writers.
-   The popular Vocaloid song "Kokoro" is about a female android (portrayed by Kagamine Rin) who receives a "heart", allowing her to feel emotions. The undue stress it afflicts on her body causes her to tragically die by the end of the song.
-   Jimmy The Robot of The Aquabats! can express emotions, like love and snarkiness, and is a talented keyboardist.
-   The bots of Steam Powered Giraffe have distinct personalities, and are shaped and sound very much like humans. The latter point is justified, since the "bots" are played by humans in heavy makeup.

-   In the video for Poets of the Fall's "Carnival of Rust," singer Zoltar, a Sad Clown fortunetelling automaton with peeling paint stuck in a glass case, is nonetheless very human in appearance (as played by vocalist Marko Saaresto) and psychology. He's obviously depressed and Love Hungry in the extreme, hoping to escape the Carnival, and his Obsession Song is a desperate bid for the love of his customer, that he might be free. He beats the walls of his case and sheds a Single Tear when his attempt fails.

    New Media 

-   Utauloids can go even farther with this, not just with design and personality, but with voice quality, since the Utau program uses recorded-voice wav files. And thanks to VCV<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  voicebanks, a song by an Utauloid can sometimes sound _completely indistinguishable from a human singer_. Notably on this issue, Teto's voicebank has been known for sounding genuinely robotic, yet she also has a VCV voicebank which some people prefer.

    Roleplay 

-   The Warforged in QDNDOS qualify as this, down to the ability to convince even their 'family' that they're regular humans/elves/biological creatures. Apparently, this even extends to the ability to reproduce.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Warforged in _Dungeons & Dragons_'s _Eberron_ setting apply, though they're half-robot-half-golem... thingies. They were originally created to be warriors, and unexpectedly developed the capacity for emotion and self-awareness. Some later material implied their supposed creators at least partly reverse-engineered them from relics found in Xen'drik, which given the history of that continent would allow several possibilities for why a constructed race capable of emotion and self-awareness would be desired.
-   The Androids in _Pathfinder_ have human biological needs, benefit from Healing magic, and possess souls. They even age and die like humans, whereupon their soul is released to the afterlife and their body restored to the "factory default" with a new soul.
    -   This trope was the intention, with the creator race wanting to play God and see if they could create life, as their technology was absolutely capable of creating androids that didn't need to eat or sleep. The fact that their creations were so perfect they were capable of attaining a soul, which is a measurable concept in-universe, would appear to be the epitome of success. Of course, that makes it complicated for those that wanted to use the Androids as a servant class.
    -   _Starfinder_, having the same setting but in the far future, has androids that are much the same and even have attained civil rights. However, these ones are effectively immortal unless and until they choose to release their soul and allow a new one into their body (essentially, reproducing).
    -   Starfinder also has Sentient Robotic Organisms (S.R.O.s), which are mentally similar to androids (complete with souls and free will), but appear much less humanoid and much more mechanical from the outside.
-   Wave Form Androids in _New Horizon_, more commonly known as Wafans. Oddly, the rulebook explicitly states that they're people, not robots... before then going on to explain the artificial objects that form the core of their intellectual abilities. Granted, they're apparently "not made in factories." Whatever that means.
-   Unfleshed in _Promethean: The Created_ are machines given sentience and will by the Divine Fire, Azoth. As Azoth is born from human will and desire, no matter the form of the machine, it is sculpted into a human form when the Azoth takes hold. Among the sample Unfleshed is a mass of nanotechnology (which calls itself "Legion") and a gun-carrier SUV, both of which were reshaped into human simulacrums on being brought to life.
-   _Ops And Tactics_ has synthetics, with their positronic brains being capable of having the same thought processes and feelings as organic beings, with "Robot" being considered a Fantastic Slur due to that. They can also have a body that looks and even feels the same as that of an organic being.
    -   Notably, they co-exist with AI units, which _aren't_ considered to be people at all.

    Theatre 

-   Karel Capek's play _R.U.R._ (which coined the very term "robot") probably created this trope. Ironically, the "robots" in the play are not truly robots in the way modern culture views them. Modern science would likely call them biological robots or Artificial Humans. That being said, the robots are mass-produced with every piece built and put together like a car on a factory line. At one point, the characters are discussing how human the robots are:
    
    **Helena:** Doctor, has Radius a soul?  
    **Dr. Gall:** I don't know. He's got something nasty.
    

    Web Animation 

-   Lopez of _Red vs. Blue_, despite being a robot and knowing it, is pretty much as well-rounded as any other character, with obvious emotions and ambitions (creating a robot army to conquer the world, being part of a freaky robot love triangle... with another robot, in the form of a tank, etc.). All of the A.I.s shown are similarly well-rounded, although that's justified by them being created from an "impression" of a human mind, complete with residual memories and emotions. In fact, they're human enough that two lived for many years without showing any sign that they weren't flesh-and-blood humans. Except for the whole, you know, being ghosts thing.
-   _RWBY_: Despite being fully synthetic, Penny is human enough to have emotions and a soul, allowing her to use an Aura. She is the first artificially created being on Remnant capable of generating an Aura.
-   In the season one finale of _Bee and Puppycat_, Bee herself is revealed to be a robot. And she appears to have always known about this.
-   _Robotbox And Cactus_: Robotbox is, well, a robot shaped like a box, yet is described as being able to do anything a human can (with an example being shown of him reading a newspaper and sitting at a kitchen table with a cup of coffee), and some things humans can't.

    Websites 

-   Parodied by _Cracked TV_. The host is an android but Michael Swaim does nothing to indicate this except introduce himself as "your host-droid Michal Swaim."
    -   Though its Spiritual Successor, Does Not Compute, shows Michael Swaim without his face on (revealing a Terminator face underneath) in the opening sequence.
-   Dr Gears of the SCP Foundation may or may not be one.

    Web Videos 

-   Although it's forced to behave, The Nostalgia Chick's Sex Bot feels unhappiness and snarks at her plenty.
-   In _Friendship is Witchcraft_ robot ponies act much like normal ones, except for their obviously mechanical voices, tendency to get stuck in loops, occasional Robo Speak, and apparently if they learn they're robots go on destructive rampages. And, at least in the case of Sweetie Belle, their immunity to the Comedic Sociopathy that other ponies possess.
-   KARA is this when she's fully assembled.
-   _Atop the Fourth Wall_ has Mechakara, who is a robot wearing the skin of the Linkara from another universe. He was recently revived by The Plot Hole into fully human, which he hates. Also, Linkara's Robot Buddy, Pollo, is pretty human in personality, if not appearance. The irony is Mechakara is the Pollo from another universe who was far less fond of his Linkara.
-   In the Critical Role one-shot _The Nautilus Ark_, heavily inspired by films like _Alien_, Forrest Coreman turns out to be a synth after passing as human for most of the game. The players, in fact, suspected that Taliesin's character, Dr. Wiser, was the synth, only to be proven wrong when he bleeds red.
