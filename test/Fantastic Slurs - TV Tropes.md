**Haley:** How can you be so smart sometimes and still be such an... an AIRHEAD!  
**Celia:** _\[a sylph from the Elemental Plane of Air\]_ HEY! There's no need for racial slurs!

In Real Life, any time one group of people has animosity for another, they'll come up with mocking or degrading terms for the targets of their disdain.

So it's no surprise that in fantasy conflicts, such as humans treating sentient robots as second-class citizens, Elves vs. Dwarves, Fur Against Fang, etc, many fantastic racists, classists, and the like have a wide vocabulary of fictional slurs to use against robots, vampires, etc. It can be very Does This Remind You of Anything? at times.

Subtropes include the following:

-   Call a Human a "Meatbag": When a robot, Energy Being, or some other manner of non-fleshy entity insults humans (or some other kind of fleshy living beings in general) over their fleshy nature.
-   Son of an Ape: Slurs based on the fact that humans are apes from a taxonomic POV are widely used by all sorts of aliens, demons, and celestial beings.

When this happens during times of war or other armed conflict, see Nicknaming the Enemy.
