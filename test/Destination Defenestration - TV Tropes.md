_"The dictionary defines defenestration as the act of throwing a person or thing out a window._  
\[Spider-Man is thrown out the window of a skyscraper\]  
_Really not my favorite word."_

The sad fate of many a Mook... mostly because it looks really cool. A sufficiently badass character punches, throws, or in any other way applies the force necessary in order to toss someone else through a window. A loud clangy window with shards rippling everywhere, at least in fiction. In Real Life, the window might be opened first.

How we see this trope typically depends on who is doing it. If a heroic character does it, we actually see them throw someone out the window, but typically not the very messy landing. With villains it's the other way around — to emphasize the cruelty. An ambiguously portrayed character may perform this feat, but you'll have to Take Our Word for It, since showing this trope usually inspires some sort of positive or negative feeling with whoever is doing it.

Bar Brawl Variants (particularly if it's set in the Wild West): Cut to street view of the pub. A character comes flying through the window onto the sidewalk, picks themselves up, and wades back into the fray with much-determined sleeve-pushing-up and angry muttering. Or it signals the end of the brawl.

A safety note: although fictional characters may be thrown through windows and get up again afterwards, in real life you can easily be killed by lacerations from large shards of broken glass, even when thrown through a ground floor window. Live-action TV doesn't use glass for this at all, but specially-made panes of _sugar_, which is weaker and breaks into much less dangerous shards. In other words, Don't Try This at Home!

See also Glass Smack and Slide for the more comical subversion. When someone does this with an object that's Appliance Defenestration. Compare Railing Kill for bridges and balconies, Thrown Out the Airlock when Recycled In Space, Walk the Plank for ships at sea or in the air, and Death Flight for flying someone into the sky and "dropping them off". Contrast Super Window Jump, when someone does this to themselves, usually intentionally. Also contrast Helpless Window Death, when the character is forced to watch through a window while someone else is killed.

Might overlap with Disney Villain Death. Not necessarily related to The Window or the Stairs, despite the name.

And remember: It's Not the Fall That Kills You… ...though in terms of this trope, even if you survived the landing, the broken glass from the window you were put through might say otherwise.

    Advertising 

-   A Bud Light commercial featured an office meeting, with the workers being asked for suggestions on how to save money. One guy suggested they stop serving Bud Light at the meetings. Cut to outside as the guy — still in his chair — goes flying through the window and lands on the ground outside the building.
-   A 90s commercial for Foster's Beer had a scene where a man is violently hurled out of a pub window by a woman while a nearby dog, who was resting on the front step of the pub's door, hauls ass away from the mayhem. What did it all translate from in Australian? The word "No".
-   An ad for Boot's No.7 cosmetics range features a woman in a white ballgown running from security guards, crashing through a window and dropping twenty storeys into an airbag, ending with her stunt double walking away and saying "I've never been the right age to.jump off a building".

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the opening sequence of the _AKIRA_ movie, little guy Kaisuke knocks a rival gang member right through a window, reminding us that being Ambiguously Gay doesn't mean you can't kick major ass.
-   _Angel Beats!_: It's played for laughs in the very first episode. Twice. On the main cast.
-   In _Beelzebub_, Kanzaki tells Oga to do this to Shiroyama. Oga punches Kanzaki through the window instead.
-   Hilariously parodied in _Bleach_. When Ichigo kicks Ebern Azgiaro through his bedroom's window after he shows up out of nowhere standing on his bed (which seems to be kind-of a minor Berserk Button for him), Orihime actually _opens said window_ so it won't break.
-   _Case Closed_:
    -   Conan Edogawa gets thrown off a burning house's window in the Moonlight Sonata arc. Good thing, it's a first-floor window so the kid isn't that badly hurt. Bad thing? The one who threw him out, Seiji Asou aka Narumi Asai aka the Sympathetic Murderer, did that to save Conan from dying with him. Soon he dies in his burning home, playing the Moonlight Sonata in his dad's old piano until he either burns to death or fatally asphyxiates, as Conan and Ran can only sadly watch.
    -   Also, several murders have the victims being thrown off windows and balconies or put in circumstances that will make them fall off. In fact, during the _Night Baron_ case, Conan gets thrown off _again_ by a killer of the week: this time it's a _very_ high hotel balcony, but he lands in the pool of the place. Later, the victim of the week is killed in a similar way... plus being Impaled with Extreme Prejudice.
    -   Subverted in a case where it _looked_ that a talented illustrator had committed suicide by jumping off her balcony... but it was a ruse from her killer who staged a complex scenario to trick the police into believing she has killed herself. Conan saw through his act soon, obviously.
    -   In a later case, Conan almost plummets from a Big Fancy House's balcony. The nearest person, however, cannot help because he is terrified by heights and about to panic, so the family butler rescues him. And this helps Conan and Heiji deduce how the murder of the case was done.
-   In the manga version of _Chrono Crusade_, Chrono actually tosses _Rosette herself_ out the window when he becomes frustrated that she won't get up in the morning. When Azmaria responds with horror, Chrono quips "don't worry, there's a lake below!" Cue Rosette coming back up to the window in a soaking wet nightgown and a fish in her mouth.
-   _Crayon Shin-chan_: An issue of the manga has a pair of hooligans attempting to scam Susan Koyuki's diner by way of Faked Food Contaminant, only to be exposed. They then attempt to retaliate, oblivious to the fact that Koyuki was an ex-Green Beret... cue Koyuki ejecting both of them via the diner's windows.
-   The _Cowboy Bebop_ episode "Ballad of Fallen Angels" has a very memorable scene where Spike is thrown out of the window by Vicious. He then falls in slow motion with the glass raining down alongside him, as soft music plays and fragmented flashbacks reveal their past together... and he casually flips a grenade through the window as he falls, ensuring a world of hurt for his tormentor.
-   A filler episode during the Trunks Saga of _Dragon Ball Z_ had this: Chi-Chi hires a tutor named Mr. Shu for Gohan, who proves to be a Sadist Teacher who prides himself on beating his students with a whip when they don't do what he says, and who gets a sick kick out of openly and relentlessly mocking and insulting Goku. When Chi-Chi finds out his true colors, she's so pissed off that she calmly opens a window, throws him out of said window, and then jumps out the window and chases him off of her property while screaming at him to leave and never come back again.
-   This is how Terry's first love Lily perishes in the _Fatal Fury_ first anime special. To make it worse, Geese throws her off a third-story window... _with a Reppuken_.
-   Rin Sohma from _Fruits Basket_, courtesy of Akito. She actually survives, though she _is_ seriously wounded (and her cousin Hiro, who witnessed the incident, is totally traumatised). It helps that she was thrown from a "mere" second floor. Her boyfriend Hatsuharu does not take this lightly.
-   Happens to Ling Yao and Lan Fan from _Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood_ at least once.<small>◊</small> It's hilarious due to how... _nonchalant_ they look as they get thrown own the window itself.

-   Played for Laughs in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_, when Austria freaks out when young Italy sneaks into his bed and ends up kicking him off a window. It's supposed to be an allusion to one of the Defenestrations of Prague mentioned below.
-   In the anime version of _High School Dx D_, Issei punches Raynare through the glass and outside the church. In the light novels, it was through a wall instead.

    -   A heroic example takes place when before being murdered by Yoshikage Kira, the teenaged Reimi Sugimoto threw a toddler boy that she was taking care of outta the nearest window, saving the child's life but falling victim to the murderer almost immediately afterwards. The boy survived and grew up to adulthood... and into the manga artist and Stand User Rohan Kishibe, one of the main characters, who takes an It's Personal approach to the plot when he finds out about this. It's also lampshaded: an old monk who knew Rohan as a kiddo says that when little!Rohan was found alive after Reimi's death, he was so traumatized that he could only say "Reimi threw me out of the window!".
    -   Another example from the same part occurs when Josuke is able to track down the minor antagonist Yuya Fungami, after spending all day being chased by his stand, Highway Star. Yuya turns out to be hospitalized after suffering a motorcycling accident, and points out that it would be cowardly of Josuke to beat up an injured man.

"The Defenestration of Ermintrude Inch" is the story of a couple in 1950s Britain, in which the husband, Osbert, accuses his wife Ermintrude of talking too much — specifically 100 times as much as he does. Being a sound engineer for the BBC, Osbert sets up a word-counter, which works at first, but his wife figures out a way to make it so that _Osbert_ has the higher count, which infuriates him, particularly after he figures out that she'd surreptitiously recorded his speech and had him playing on a loop while he was not at home.

Shortly after the tale wraps up, a woman comes into the pub and chews Harry Purvis out — to which he replies meekly, "Yes, Ermintrude."

    **Benjamin:** This is Christopher... and in the event of you attempting any violence on my person, Mr. Hyde, Christopher's going to take an attitude, and believe me when I tell you when you don't wanna be there when Christopher takes an attitude. _\[...\]_ Now, there's two things we can do, here: I can tell you what the hell I'm talkin' about, or you can try and throw Christopher out that itty-bitty window. I don't think Christopher'll fit.

    Myths and Religion 

-   In The Bible's Books of Kings, the evil Queen Dowager Jezebel was betrayed by her own retinue and thrown out of the palace window.

-   According to his legend, Saint Bernard of Menthon was a Sheltered Aristocrat who wanted to be a priest rather than giving into an Arranged Marriage.

-   "Stone Cold" Steve Austin was sent crashing headfirst into a plate glass window at the hands of The Undertaker on the May 3, 2001, episode of WWF Smackdown
-   There's an infamous series of spots (including a couple of nasty looking botches) from a WWE(then F) match between Kurt Angle and Shane Mcmahon at the King of the Ring in 2001 — Shane ended up being thrown through three glass windows that made up part of the set, when the glass didn't break they simply repeated the spot (almost always a big no-no in wrestling) making the whole sequence that more brutal and deranged.
    -   It's usually a big no-no because it makes it look scripted (which it more-or-less is) rather than free-flowing (which is how it's supposed to look). They got away with it because Kurt Angle had quite obviously been trying to do just this, rather than a spur-of-the-moment thing. Adding to the brutality, he was throwing Shane with a belly-to-belly suplex, which is done by flinging someone upside-down over your head. So when Shane bounced off the plexiglass, he landed on the back of his head and neck, twice, _before_ the glass broke. Then got sent through two more panes.
-   In _Lucha Underground_, people frequently get thrown through the window of the owner Dario Cueto's office. He frequently complains that getting the window fixed is expensive.

    Radio 

-   Discussed in _The Ricky Gervais Show_ when Karl talked about how a baby is more likely to survive being thrown out of a window than an adult because its unaware of what's happening so it won't tense up (which, according to Karl, causes falling damage). Stephen and Ricky told him he was talking crap and (in very serious tones) told him not to throw any babies (or cats) out of windows _ever_.

    Roleplay 

-   In _Darwin's Soldiers_, Alfred throws someone through a reinforced window...with fatal results.

-   Charles Barkley did this to a fan as retaliation for getting hit with a cup of ice.

    Tabletop Games

-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Defenestrate<small>◊</small>, an instant that destroys any creature without flying. Hilariously, this can include gargantuan creatures such as giants, leviathans and beasts the size of centennial trees or entire forests. Those are some pretty big windows.

    Theatre 

-   In _Accidental Death of an Anarchist_, the Posthumous Character of the Anarchist somehow fell out of a window during police interrogation. The Maniac and the police go through several reenactments of how this could have happened.

    Video Games

During Evie and Lucy's fight, Lucy charges at Evie (who is standing in front of a large stain-glass window), intending to push or throw her through the window. Evie steps to the side at the last second and Lucy ends up throwing herself out the window. Although she's able to grab Evie's necklace key and hang from it, threatening to take Evie with her. Evie uses her hidden blade to cut the key off, saving herself but losing the artifact.
-   _Baldur's Gate III_: If you pass a strength check, you can yeet enemies over ledges.
-   _Batman: Arkham Origins_: the Joker kicks Electrocutioner out of a high-riser window, along with the chair he was sitting on. He takes at least ten seconds to reach the floor.
-   _Bloodrayne 2_ allows you to do this. Of special note: In one part of the assault on Kagan's tower at the end, you square off against a pair of Giant Mooks. You _can_ fight them the traditional way. Or simply wait for them to charge at you, leap out of the way, and watch them run right through the glass windows behind you.
-   _ClockTower_: This is poor Ann's fate. Sometimes. The 10-page prologue manga makes this death canon, though.
-   Upon defeating Derrick Lynch in _Crisis Zone_, he is defeated like this.
-   Commander Lockhart gets subjected to this in _Crysis 2_.
-   _Crisis Beat_ has a special move called Automatic Lock-On, which allow players to grab on mooks and pummel them repeatedly on a fixed location before sending them crashing into objects with a powerful uppercut. This trope happens if the object happens to be a window, or glass panels and storefronts.
-   The final boss fight of _Def Jam Fight for New York_ takes place in an office with three large windows. Chances are quite good that one of the fighters will go through and plunge to their death. This is, in fact, the _only_ way to kill Crow. He's immune to defeat by environmental damage, submission hold, and through weapons.
-   _Deus Ex: Human Revolution_ inverts this. After the tutorial segment, Jensen is tossed through a window and into the wall behind it. He's realistically cut up badly and bleeding everywhere, with some glass shards actually visibly sticking out of him. This is partially why he's augmented. The rest of it being a bullet to the head from his own revolver.
-   In _Die Hard Trilogy 2: Viva Las Vegas_, the boss of the Hoover Dam light gun stage is blown through a window during her Disney Villain Death.
-   In _Drake of the 99 Dragons_, the hero Drake does this to himself as he thinks he has become immortal. He technically is, as he gets brought back to life every time he died.

-   _Fatal Fury_
    -   In the very first game, losing against Geese will result in him kicking off the player from his tower, creating this trope's effect as the continue screen for his stage.
    -   A Zigzagged Trope in regards to Terry and Geese's fight. First, Terry does _not_ intend to throw Geese off, it's a complete accident since they're fighting with the huge windows of Geese's penthouse office as background. Second, Terry attempts to _Save the Villain_ via grabbing Geese's hand as he breaks through the balcony. Third, Geese _refuses_ Terry's help and willingly lets himself fall off, an Evil Laugh _and_ a maniacal grin on his lips. Fourth, it's actually a Thanatos Gambit from Geese: since he has a son named Rock who's around the same age that Terry was when Geese killed his and Andy's father Jeff, Geese let himself die to saddle Terry with the guilt of orphaning an innocent little boy — the same feeling that drove Terry and Andy to fight Geese in the first place, thus he both leaves Rock in good hands AND avenges his own death in a really sharp way.

-   With _Friday the 13th: The Game_ averting Soft Glass, it's possible to damage and even kill yourself if you go out a broken window or fall a story down. One of Jason's environmental kills even involves throwing a counselor through a window.
-   This trope is a bit of a hallmark for Tom Francis:
    -   _Gunpoint_ has this happen to the player character at the beginning of the game. He gets flung out of his apartment's window, hits the wall of the building next door, and falls through the glass ceiling below him. After you get out of the building, it's revealed that he jumped out of the window himself, trying out a pair of "hypertrousers" that lets you jump with enough strength to shatter glass windows. There's even a track in the soundtrack called Defenestraight to my Heart. During standard gameplay, you have the ability to do this at will (if there's a window nearby).
    -   In _Heat Signature_, this happens again during the tutorial, but in space. Yes, the spaceships have windows. Yes, you can suck guards outside by shooting windows. If you're a traditionalist of the trope you can also smack or blast them through the window the old-fashioned way; especially useful when armor negates damage but _not_ knockback.
    -   In the trailer for Tactical Breach Wizards, somebody gets kicked out of the window in the first twenty seconds. On Steam, the three games are even referred to as The Defenestration Trilogy.

-   _MadWorld_:
    -   Elise is SPANKED out a cathedral window.
        
        **Holmes:** Out the window with her wings clipped! Now that's a classy kill... DID YOU SEE THAT?! THAT WAS AWESOME!!!  
        **Kreely:** Oh yeah! Jack did a great job!
        
    -   You can do this to Mooks in the Courtyard of the Mad Castle, and you can also do it in the Facility level...right into SPACE for a messy end.
-   Defied by the Big Bad of _Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death_, whose gigantic Base on Wheels is proudly dubbed "The Indefenistrable III". It lives up to its name by not being thrown through a window at any point in the game. Whether its two predecessors lived up to their names is a question left answered.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   _Mass Effect 2_ invokes this trope:
        
        **Eclipse Trooper:** I've got nothing more to say to you. If you—**RENEGADE INTERUPT**  
        _\[Shepard pushes him through the skyscraper window\]_  
        **Shepard:** How 'bout "goodbye"?  
        **Jack:** Damn, I need to take lessons from you.

-   _Max Payne 3_ combines this with a Super Window Jump at the beginning of Chapter 2, where Max pushes a mook through the VIP lounge window.
-   This is how Sigma is defeated in _Mega Man X7_.
-   In _Metroid Prime 3: Corruption_, the Berserker Lord tosses a Federation soldier through the window in order to herald the boss's entrance. It's worth considering that the "window" is an external panoramic viewport overlooking the docking bay of a starship. An _external_ docking bay. This implies that it is very thick tempered glass capable of holding an atmosphere, and the Lord throws the poor Redshirt through it so hard that it shatters into a _bajillion_ tiny pieces.
-   _Minority Report: Everybody Runs_ allows the player to throw enemies through plate glass windows. It was such a fun highlight of an otherwise lousy game that _Nintendo Power_ named it best Guilty Pleasure of 2002.
-   _Mr. Shifty_: The titular character can punch people through windows. But only if the punch would have killed them anyway.
-   In _Murdered: Soul Suspect_, Ronan gets thrown out the window during his fight with the Bell Killer. The landing mostly killed him, but Ronan managed to pull himself back until the Bell Killer shot seven bullets through his chest to finish him off.
-   During the climax of _Mystery Case Files: Broken Hour_, Meredith Huxley gets blasted through a glass clock face on top of a huge Clock Tower and plummets down to her demise.
-   _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_: It's possible for the final boss in his second form to instantly kill Travis by punching him out the window. This fact is actually foreshadowed as early as the scene where Travis meets with Sylvia outside a restaurant, where a guy falls out from the sky into a car. Seems to be a favorite of his. Travis then does the same to him, but the latter survives by going One-Winged Angel.
-   Queen Jocasta tells the player character in _Oedipus in my Inventory_ to "get Baby Oedipus out of the castle". This is how he chooses to interpret it.
-   _Oni_ has a pretty hilarious take on this in the third level. Konoko is at the top of a tower in a factory complex. A squad of TCTF troops is outside, being pinned down by fire from Syndicate goons in the main lobby. Konoko radios to say she'll be right down to help them when a previously-defeated Syndicate goon stands back up.
    
    **Demo Trooper:** Fool! I've just triggered my detonation harness! In five seconds this entire tower will be vaporised!  
    ''\[Konoko looks at the trooper, out the window, and back to him; cut to an exterior shot of the tower, where the trooper smashes out the window, falls through the skylight of the lobby, and detonates\]  
    **TCTF Officer:** Uh, roger that. Foyer secured.

-   _Paprium_ ends with you facing the Final Boss, Murdock, in his penthouse office, ending with you uppercutting Murdock through the office's window to his demise.
-   _River City Girls_: After beating the final boss, the protagonists decide to drop-kick them out the window of their penthouse office. Unfortunately, they're a lot too enthusiastic about the drop-kicking and thus go sailing out the window themselves. They have time to lampshade how they Didn't Think This Through before hitting the ground. Fortunately, as the game is highly comedic they're just fine, if a little banged up.
-   _Saints Row_:
    -   In _Saints Row_, this is what Ben King does to Tanya Winters at the end of the Vice Kings arc. Granted, she managed to hold onto the window until Ben stomped her arm, but it still counts.
    -   In _Saints Row 2_, The Boss shoots Dane Vogel right out of an office building at least seventy feet in the air after subduing Ultor.
-   You kill the Big Bad of the Taito Light Gun Game _Under Fire_ like this.
-   This happens twice to Nathan in _Uncharted 4: A Thief's End_, both times he's thrown out by Nadine.
    -   The first time occurs after Sam has stolen the St. Dismas cross and the group are trying to get away. Nate opens a door and comes face to face with Nadine, who promptly hands him his ass. She finished the fight by kicking him out of a window, expecting the five story fall to kill him. Naturally, he's able to survive by clinging to a curtain and throwing himself onto the side of the building.
    -   The second time happens much later, in chapter 15. After Nathan and Sam survive a chain of RPG shots, Nadine gets the drop on them. During the ensuing fight, Nadine throws Nathan out of a window and he once again needs to scale the side of a building (this one much less stable) but this time, it's to rejoin the fight.
-   _Yakuza 0_: After fighting his way through Dojima HQ to reach Kuze, Kiryu faces off against Yoneda in a bathroom, having punched, kicked, slammed and beaten the man with furniture who still won't give up all the way through the building's myriad of rooms and corridors up to this point. What finally puts the guy down until he appears later in the game is Kiryu smashing Yoneda's head into a urinal, then quite literally _dropkicking_ him out of the window!

    -   In the Yellow trailer, when Junior pulls out some of Yang's hair, she punches him through the window of his own club. They're fighting on the ground floor. She punches him so hard he smashes through the window of the next floor up and falls a storey before landing on the street. _Ouch._

Since Bun-bun has made it to the top of the naughty list every year and repeatedly tried to kill Santa Claus, the elves are very unwilling to work for him. Thus, his method of persuasion is to go down the chain of command throwing people out of high windows until he gets to someone willing to serve him.

    -   A flash back to Doc and Brock's college days ends with a rampaging Brock throwing someone through a window. He also does this to a random thug in the pilot episode.
    -   In a later episode, Rusty leaps through the window of a skyscraper. He's not committing suicide, he wants to show off a device that lets him hover. Unfortuntly for him, he didn't take into account the glass shards and a huge one punctures his leg, causing him to black out.

    Real Life 

-   There have been least three notable Defenestrations in Prague in the past 600 years, the third of which is the Trope Namer since the word "defenestration" was first coined to describe the event. (That particular defenestration, of some Catholic officials from Prague City Hall by Protestant burghers, started the Thirty Years' War; unlike the other defenestrations, the defenestrees survived.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) The earlier ones (1419, 1483) were associated with the proto-Protestant Hussite heresy and general rebellion in Greater Bohemia and Moravia. The fourth and last happened in 1948, the victim being Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk; Dirty Communists were implicated in that.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Though there wasn't such a thing as a Czech 'nation' at the time, people of the present day nation-state of Czechia often consider Defenestration their nation's National Sport. Apparently, Czechs just don't feel it's a proper revolution until somebody gets thrown out a window. Political protests have been known to feature their targets being defenestrated in effigy.
-   During the Cultural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping's son Deng Pufang was tortured by the Red Guards before being thrown out of a third-floor window at the Beijing University; he survived, but was left a paraplegic. While neither openly denounced the revolutionaries, nor Mao for that matter, there are rumors that Deng Xiaoping always held a grudge towards Mao over the incident.
-   A story about windows and the Cultural Revolution was that of the famous mathematician Chen Jingrun (whose groundbreaking work on the Goldbach Conjecture is usually rather anti-climatically over-simplified in the lay press as "proving 1+2=3"), who defenestrated himself from the top floor of his office building to escape Red Guards. He would have fallen to his death except a tree broke his fall and he managed to land unharmed. Apparently, the leader of that Red Guard brigade was very impressed, saying, "It is no wonder that you are a famous mathematician. You even know how to select the angle when you jump out of the window."
-   Toronto lawyer Gary Hoy apparently had a fondness for throwing himself against skyscraper windows to demonstrate their strength, which worked out just fine until July 9, 1993. His faith in the strength of the glass was justified; the window didn't break but instead _popped out of its frame_ and Hoy fell 24 stories to his death in an act of self-defenestration.
-   Murder, Inc. killer Abe "Kid Twist" Reles became a police informant to avoid the death penalty. After he sent several of his bosses to the electric chair, he went out a 6th story window at the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island. The official story was that he was trying to escape, which is pretty absurd. He was being "guarded" by several New York City policemen, but no one was arrested for his murder/suicide/accident. The newspaper headline announcing his death was "The Canary Who Could Sing, But Couldn't Fly." Very cold.
-   In 1969 alleged anarchist terrorist Giuseppe Pinelli _somehow_ went fatally out of the fourth-floor window of a Milan police station while being interrogated. The death was officially declared an accident, to the disbelief of many. The incident inspired Dario Fo's play _Accidental Death of an Anarchist_, although the death is not actually depicted in it. One area of suspicion was that his arms were not broken, indicating he was dead or unconscious when he fell, as an instinctive reaction by someone falling head first (even a suicide) is to reach out their arms to protect their head.
-   Similarly, in 1920 New York City Italian-born anarchist Andrea Salsedo died after falling to his death from a 14th-floor window. He had been arrested in connection with the anarchist bombings which had rocked the US in 1919, due to one of the bombers accidentally blowing himself up. A flyer discovered by his body was traced to the print shop where Salsedo worked (an anarchist newspaper was printed on the premises). Salsedo was held by the Bureau of Investigation (precursor to the FBI) for eight weeks incommunicado, without a lawyer, and reportedly harshly interrogated. Whether he killed himself or was murdered has been a source of controversy. Some claim he chose suicide to avoid implicating fellow anarchists if he broke during interrogation. Others claim he did give names, so perhaps he killed himself out of guilt. There have been allegations that he was severely beaten by BOI agents during interrogation, and thrown to his death. Whatever the case, his fate was overshadowed with the arrest of Sacco and Vanzetti (connected with the same group) just two days later.
-   In South Africa in The Apartheid Era, The Bureau Of State Security adamnatly insisted black activist Steve Biko was interrogated robustly but within the legal guidelines, and they were so solicitous of his welfare that they even opened a window to air the twelth-floor interrogation room. Ag, jislaaik, man, we couldn't be blamed for a communist fanatic choosing to throw himself to his death rather than crack under interrogation, and he was an ANC terrorist anyway, so what's the big deal?
-   When someone in the body politic is found dead under a shattered high-level window, conspiracy theories flourish right on the spot. Norwegian politics have two examples:
    -   Center Party politician Nils Trædal was found like this in 1949, apparently the day before a crucial political debate concerning the leadership of the Norwegian home front during World War II. He _had_ been instrumental in securing that said home front did not seize complete political power after the German capitulation in 1945, and therefore, theories about his demise began to grow. Years later, another Center Party leader stated he had committed suicide, but...
    -   During the debates concerning where to put a new main airport in Norway, a certain scientist with good arguments against the current plans was found dead outside his hotel in Denmark, presumably thrown out of the window of his room. This example is jarring because he was naked, and all his data was stolen. The airport 'was laid out as planned — and nobody ever talked about it again. _Officially_.
-   Similarly, when the ex-US Secretary of Defence James Forrestal was found dead under the window of his room in the Naval Medical Center, where he was interned for depression treatment, the theories of foul play were more than abundant. However, presiding over a controversial winding down and acrimonious reorganizing of a US post-war military, Forrestal _was_ under a lot of stress, especially when differing political ideas brought him up against his former close ally, the President, and Truman fired him in the end after learning of his surreptitious contacts with his archrival Dewey. It's entirely possible (and generally believed most probable) that Forrestal _did_ become suicidal, even after his state of mind seemed to improve, knowledge of clinical depression being rather slim in the late Forties. The oft-told legend that he threw himself from the window, shouting "The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!", is still a legend, though. While Forrestal _did_ believe that the confrontation with the Soviet Union was inevitable, nobody had seen him (or other people) defenestrating himself, and if any suicide note was written by him, it was an excerpt from the Sophocles tragedy _Ajax_.
-   The death of the Serbian Nazi collaborator Milan Nedic in 1946 involved him falling out of the window of a hospital in Belgrade. It's still not fully clear whether he willingly threw himself off to avert being tried and surely executed, or he was thrown out by others.
-   As this video shows, it is perfectly possible for a momentary lapse in judgement to result in people defenestrating themselves through ground floor glass windows and doors. While some ground floor windows and doors are reinforced with this in mind, it doesn't take much force from someone running against a thin plate-glass window to send it crashing down.
