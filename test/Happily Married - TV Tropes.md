**Chandler:** _\[In response to Wendy making a move on him\]_ I'm married!  
**Wendy:** So? I'm married.  
**Chandler:** I'm _happily_ married.  
**Wendy:** Oh. What's that like?

Against all the odds, in defiance of the laws of drama, spitting in the face of the Awful Wedded Life, there is... the Happily Married couple.

This is a couple, Alpha or Beta, who are in love and not wangsting it up dysfunctionally all the time. They avoid Poor Communication Kills, won't jump to conclusions, and treat each other with love and respect. In short, whatever troubles they have are minor and don't lead to the misanthropy of No Accounting for Taste or The Masochism Tango.

Both inside and outside of Romance Parental Abandonment, Shipping Bed Death and the Cartwright Curse tend to kill them off like flies. Aiding this is that most drama considers the above _"boring!"_ (remember, Rule of Drama) and will usually try to make things _"interesting!"_ with "plot twists" that threaten to split them up, and otherwise fill their path with rocks to make them Star-Crossed Lovers. (Their safest bet is as the Foil to a more turbulent couple.)

The net effect of having a Happily Married couple in a series is one of stability. (As a general rule, Happily Married couples with kids will be depicted as more loving and more stable than those without.) Just having them around gives viewers and characters in the show an emotional anchor and safety net, as well as someones to root for while the Official Couple is deciding Will They or Won't They?. Needless to say, most viewers will thusly become very protective of said couple and complain when authors needlessly torment them.

These couples benefit from The Power of Love. In addition, any time a sequel is set a generation later than the original, the main couple from the original will probably have this type of relationship to show that they did get a Happy Ending — and Babies Ever After to prove it.

Despite some fiction likening this to a Discredited Trope (partly because common knowledge dictates that happy marriages are ill suited for drama. Whether common knowledge is right or not is another matter entirely), a _lot_ of people out there would call this Truth in Television, which is why we won't list all those examples. (Congrats to you!) Apparently the secret is to understand that you will end up arguing at some point and that does not mean you are no longer in love but keep working at your marriage, talk to each other, do little things all the time, and never confuse falling in love and being in love; they feel different. This advice is often summed up with "Don't go to bed still angry at each other." There's absolutely no shame in _simply getting along well_, if it works for the two of you.

Not to be confused with Sickeningly Sweethearts, which is basically puppy love. They _can_ overlap, but it's rare. This trope usually gives viewers warm fuzzy feelings—_usually_, as the cynicism of the viewers still has to be taken into account. If and when they have kids, they will often become Good Parents.

When this overlaps with Arranged Marriage, it's a Perfectly Arranged Marriage. When this overlaps with the characters being _unrepentant villains_, it's Unholy Matrimony. When it turns out that they're not really as happy as they let on, it's Happy Marriage Charade.

Obviously, this is the desired outcome for most who want to marry, so No Real Life Examples, Please!

## Other Examples:

    Asian Animation 

-   In _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_, the main villain Wolffy has a wife named Wolnie. Despite the constant abuse Wolnie puts Wolffy through for constantly failing to capture the goats they want to eat, she does genuinely love her husband and the two otherwise seem to have a pretty happy marriage.

    Audio Plays 

-   This is the premise of _Our Honeymoon_. Each of the four tracks are of you sharing a cute morning with your husband and each of the four are a different voice actor and character type scenario.

    Comic Strips 

-   Calvin's parents from _Calvin and Hobbes_ are quite loving, despite the stress of having a kid like Calvin. Or possibly _because_ they have a kid like Calvin, moments of peace and restaurant dates are so much more enjoyable (even if Calvin's dad keeps turning his head because he thought he heard sirens).
-   Many newspaper-strip comics are more about the travails married people find than about their personal relationship. Dagwood and Blondie, Hi and Lois, Hagar and Helga, the parents in _Baby Blues_, the parents in _For Better or for Worse_.
-   In _Zits_ the loving, stable marriage between Connie and Walt Duncan infuriates their son, Jeremy, by adding to their general dorkiness: their happy stability makes him too well-adjusted to have a tragic backstory. One strip shows the parents talking and laughing over doing the dishes, prompting Jeremy to sigh, "The award for 'person whose life least resembles MTV' goes to..." (or something like that.)

-   Roger and Andrea from _FoxTrot_ (much to Jason's disgust when he sees them kissing). Despite every crisis they've been through (Roger quitting his job, Andy desperately acting young again, the many horrible, Horrible Camping Trips), their love shows no signs of faltering.
-   Bob Weber's _Moose and Molly_ are heavy-set, low-rung blue-collar types, totally blissed out on each other.
-   _One Big Happy_ has two generations of married couples and a couple of children living in the same house.

-   _Spider-Man_: The newspaper comic version of Peter Parker and Mary Jane are blissfully unaffected by _One More Day_.

-   Sally and Ted Forth. Each would probably drive another spouse crazy, but they're perfect together.
-   The couple who became/inspired Gomez and Morticia Addams. Unlike all the other couples whom Charles Addams depicted, they are perfectly and eternally un/happy together.
-   The _Mr. Potato Head_ comic strip clearly shows Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head to be happy together, with a fair number of strips having them make out or say sentimental things to one another.

    Fairy Tales 

-   In _The Handkerchief_, the king and queen have one of the most trusting and loving relationships in folklore. The queen loves the king for his kindness and wisdom, and the king loves the queen for her own cleverness.

    Films — Animation 

-   Bob and Helen Parr in _The Incredibles_, though this is played with a little. A lot of the first movie focuses on the hitches in their marriage that come as a result of their differing reactions to leaving the superhero life (Helen is able to handle it, while Bob basically has a midlife crisis). Later, Helen is absolutely devastated to think that Bob is cheating on her. When they reunite and finally are open with each other though, Bob refers to her as "the most perfect woman in the entire world", and they are shown much more happy and adjusted once the rift between them closes. Continues in the sequel, where Helen offers to become the breadwinner so Bob can become a House Husband and not have to return to a job he hates, showing her concern for Bob's happiness. He nearly breaks himself completely to make sure Helen does well and does not hesitate to suit up and rescue her when he finds out she's in danger.
-   Manny and Gypsy in _A Bug's Life_ present a subtle example. Their marriage is only alluded to sparingly, and they don't so much as kiss, seeming content to hold hands in tender moments. Gypsy is quite understanding of her magician husband's eccentricities, offering support both on and offstage, while Manny provides the Large Ham stage presence central to their double act.

-   Shrek and Fiona have their problems to deal with, but they love each other. This is best showcased in the second film where Shrek does his best to be a supportive husband and Fiona deliberately waiting past-midnight to prove to Shrek that she loves him just the way he is, ogre and all. They later have triplets, which puts some strain on their marriage but they still love each other and are Good Parents to their children.

-   Carl and Ellie in _Up_ definitely qualify, even if they had trouble making a family and fulfilling their dream to go to South America since by the time they were able to afford the trip Ellie soon passed away. This is demonstrated at the end, when Carl looks through Ellie's Adventure Book one last time to find the message "Thanks for the adventure! Now go have a new one."
-   _Toy Story_:
    -   Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head. Though the former has to repeat to himself in _Toy Story 2_ that he's married when he meets one of the Barbie dolls.

-   This is implied in most Disney movies and frequently supported in sequels, such as _The Little Mermaid (1989)_, _The Lion King (1994)_, and _Beauty and the Beast_ (technically a midquel, but the ending fastforwards a year after the first movie so the audience can see Belle and the Prince together). The first two,, for instance, show them content in their relationship and raising their children, who are now Spin-Offspring.
    -   Also the case in _Cinderella III_. Heck, the first song of the movie has Cinderella telling us how happy she is in her married life and the prince several times referring to her as his "perfect wife". The sequel for _Sleeping Beauty_ shows us that Aurora and Philip are quite happy as well.
    -   _Tarzan_ got an animated series where we see Tarzan and Jane are happily married. Jane even proudly admitted it to her high society friends when they came for a visit; she's referring to Tarzan's heart but they see another reason.
    -   Rapunzel's parents in _Tangled_. One of the first things in the movie is the king (and most of his subjects, for that matter) searching furiously for a way to heal the ill queen. Even after their baby daughter is kidnapped, the two are shown supporting each other in the hope of finding her again.
    -   King Fergus and Queen Elinor in _Brave_, crossed with Perfectly Arranged Marriage. While Elinor admits at one point that she herself was uncertain about her arranged marriage, she now is very happy with her husband. On his side, Fergus was shocked to think that Elinor was ever uncertain about marrying him. Later, when he suspects that Mordu broke into the castle and attacked Elinor, he goes from his normally pleasant demeanor to a berserker rage.
    -   Roger and Anita in _101 Dalmatians_. The loss of the puppies (and later Pongo and Perdita) never puts a strain on their relationship. Pongo and Perdita themselves also qualify; like their owners, the loss of their puppies never affected their relationship, and they even team up in order to find them.
    -   Pacha and Chicha in _The Emperor's New Groove_ have a well-established, humble life on a hill with two young children and a baby on the way. Their first scene together sees them threatening to be Sickeningly Sweethearts to get their kids to bed and Chicha threatening to hurt the Emperor for daring to blow off her husband after he traveled so far on the Emperor's request.
-   About halfway through _The Prince of Egypt_, Moses marries Tzipporah, and the two stick together through thick and thin for the rest of the film, with Tzipporah deciding to come with Moses to Egypt even if it would mean leaving her family behind forever, as well as rushing to help him when he's knocked into the dirt by the angry Jews.
    -   The spiritual sequel/prequel/whatever, _Joseph: King of Dreams_ has Joseph marry Asenath. The two are shown working together on plans to save Egypt from famine, have several children, and see their life together as proof of a better future ahead. When Joseph imprisons one of his brothers later, Asenath's reminding him of their earlier relationship was able to sooth him for a short period of time.
-   Zigzagged with La Muerte and Xibalba from _The Book of Life_. Word of God confirms that they both only have eyes for each other, and have _many_ children. However, due to a previous wager (the exact circumstances unknown), Xibalba cheated on it and was sent to the Land of the Forgotten. The prologue shows that La Muerte is still upset about it, but they're talking, meaning that they're now on good terms (somewhat). Xibalba endangers their marriage _again_ when Manolo reveals that he cheated on the wager of who would marry Maria. She is _furious._ But, by the end, after Xibalba apologizes for his actions and asks for her forgiveness, she accepts, and they kiss. By the end of the movie, they play this trope straight.
-   At the end of _How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World_, Hiccup and Astrid get married and then are shown several years later with two kids.
-   In _Turning Red_, though Jin is something of a Hen Pecked Husband, it's obvious throughout the film that he and Ming do truly love each other.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Greek Mythology
    -   Baucis and Philemon. An elderly couple who entertained Zeus and Hermes unaware to the fullest extent of Sacred Hospitality and beyond, they received having a wish granted. They wished that they would die at the same moment so that neither of them would have to live widowed. They didn't even die exactly; at the end of their long lives, as they stood looking at one another, they were transformed into a pair of trees with the limbs intertwined so that they could never be separated. It's almost uncharacteristically sweet.
    -   Cyane and Anapos. Cyane tried to stop Hades from abducting/marrying Persephone by citing her own happy marriage as an example of consensual relationship, and as the opposite of Hades' own methods.
    -   Hilariously, Typhon and Echidna. Two of the worst monsters to ever come out of Tartarus (who by the way is Typhon's father), are entirely faithful to one another and support each other in all of their endeavours. Typhon eventually becomes Sealed Evil in a Can, but Echidna never moves on. All of her young (and there are a lot of them) are also Typhon's. By Greek standards that is weirdly functional.
    -   The Rescue Romance of Perseus and Andromeda. Just the fact that neither cheated on the other is a _very_ good sign.
    -   Ariadne and Dionysus. Dionysus saved Ariadne when she was left by Theseus on Naxos and she later accompanied him during his journeys. (Though some sources say that Dionysius had his eyes on Ariadne for a while already, and thus threatened Theseus in his dreams so he'd leave her.) He loved her enough to not only go down to the Underworld after her death to demand her soul back, but also made her immortal afterwards.
    -   Hector and Andromache in _The Iliad_ in sharp contrast to everyone else. Priam's a philandering bastard, Helen and Menelaus/Helen and Paris are horribly dysfunctional, and we won't even get started on Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. Hector and Andromache honestly seem to have been a good match.
    -   Odysseus and Penelope from _The Odyssey_. Okay, there was the stuff with Circe and Calypso but neither of those was what you could call 100% consensual (because when a very powerful being that could kill you in a heartbeat wants to sleep with you, it's smart not to argue, and Odysseus is nothing if not smart) and he _did_ go to the ends of Earth (and Hell and back) to get back to Penelope. That counts for something. As does the fact that he _turned down **immortality**_ for her. For her part, Penelope did all she could to hold off the obnoxious suitors and stay faithful to her husband. After ten years of devotion to her husband, Penelope feared the worst and asked Artemis to strike her down painlessly, either because she wanted to be Together in Death with Odysseus, or because she knew her suitors would kill her son and force her to choose between them (or not even let her choose), or both.
    -   Hades and Persephone. The fact that he wanted to _marry_ her (as in, keep her around) rather than have a one-night stand speaks volumes in Greek mythology. Hades's brothers Poseidon and Zeus (Zeus being Persephone's _dad_, even) were quite the philanderers. Hades was _not_. It also started as an arranged marriage (unlike the Everybody Hates Hades interpretation, the Hymn to Demeter made it abundantly clear that Zeus arranged the whole thing without Demeter or Persephone's consent, because Zeus is kind of a dick), making it even more impressive that they manage to make it one of the most functional and happy relationships in the mythos. Persephone is even said to prefer her time in the Underworld with her husband than with her mother.
    -   Orpheus and Eurydice until she's dragged to Hades, but even then, he loves her so much that he goes to Hades and back to try and retrieve her. When he fails at the _very last moment_, man, how he mourns...
    -   Eros and Psyche are an unlikely pair, considering how the vast majority of the Greek pantheon are constitutionally incapable of anything resembling fidelity. The story of the origins of their marriage is about trusting and going to great lengths to mend bridges.
-   From Norse Mythology:
    -   Freyr and Gerðr, though getting her to fall for him leads to his death he didn't regret it.
    -   Balder and Nanna. The Norse really liked their gods to be happily married before they were killed by giants.

-   Egyptian Mythology has Osiris and Isis who were surprisingly non-dysfunctional considering they were siblings. When the former was killed, the latter devoted much of her life to bringing him back.
-   Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus are _usually_ portrayed this way, as part of the warm mythology of Christmas. (If Santa and Mrs. Claus _didn't_ get along like the idealized grandpa and grandma, it wouldn't work with the rest of the story. This is extremely amusing for people who know that Santa Claus is based in part on the historical Saint Nicholas of Myra, who was a bishop and therefore celibate.)
-   Robin Hood and Maid Marian didn't get married in many of the original ballads (usually because she didn't exist yet), but many adaptations happily pair them off. The commentary for the 2010 movie stated that each era makes them into that era's idea of the perfect marriage.
-   Irish Mythology:
    -   Deirdre and Naoise from _TheExileOfTheSonsOfUisnech_. Deirdre is the daughter of the court poet of King Conchobar of Ulster, who orders that she be raised away from the eyes of men, due to a prophecy that she would be so beautiful that kings and lords would go to war over her, much blood would be spilled in her name, Ulter's three finest warriors would be forced into exile and die for her sake, and the kingdom of Ulster would collapse; ignoring the protests of his warriors to kill the baby and totally avert the prophecy, Conchobhar intends to take her as his wife once she is of marriageable age. Deirdre grows up with foster parents and out of sight of all boys, so she doesn't fall for anyone else before Conchobar marries her. Unsurprisingly, things do not go according to plan; Deirdre, repulsed by the aging, foul-tempered king, has a vision of a handsome, fearless young warrior with raven-black hair, snow-white skin, and blood-red cheeks and instantly falls in love. Her teacher and foster-mother, Leabharcham, tells her that that description matches Naoise Mac Uisnich, Conchobhar's finest warrior and hunter. With a small amount of complicity with Leabharcham, Deirdre meets Naoise. When he is initially reluctant to elope with her, she literally pounces on him and says that he will have "two ears of mockery and shame" if he refuses her. Whether it's meant as a joke or totally serious, Naoise agrees to go with her, and his two brothers, Ardan and Ainnle, tag along, unwilling to be separated from Naoise. The little group ends up in Scotland, where they live simply and happily for a while (in a few versions of the story, they have a son and a daughter, who are fostered by Manannan Mac Lir, the god of the sea, for their own safety)... until Conchobhar's men find them. Despite their strange meeting and courtship, Deirdre and Naoise seem to have the most loving marriage in Irish mythology.
-   Welsh Mythology:
    -   Pwyll and Rhiannon from _Mabinogion_. They met and got married pretty quickly, but they had to deal with Rhiannon's jealous exboyfriend Gwawl who took advantage of Pwyll's kindness to demand to marry Rhiannon instead of Pwyll. Together they came up with a plan to get rid of Gwawl to get married. In their marriage, they have to deal with judgmental nobles because Rhiannon didn't get pregnant for the first two years of their marriage. When their son was conceived and born, they then lost him due to their careless handmaids falling asleep. Worse, Rhiannon was framed by said handmaids who claimed that Rhiannon ate her son. Pwyll refused to set her aside and stays by her while she did her penance. The couple is eventually reunited with their son and properly named him Pryderi.

    Theatre 

-   _Fiddler on the Roof_:
    -   Tevye and Golde. It was revealed in a lovely Aw, Look! They Really Do Love Each Other duet.
    -   Their daughters end up happily married to the men of their choices. All three unions face varying external conflicts that try to tear them apart, but the love between the couples never wavers.
-   Wilbur and Edna Turnblad from _Hairspray_. Wilbur says it all in their song together - "_When I need a lift// time brings a gift// Another day with you_".
-   _1776_.
    -   John and Abigail have three duets, with "Yours Yours Yours" expressing how much they love and miss each other. Abigail helps to keep John from flying _too_ far off the handle and reminds him that there's more to his life than yelling at Congress. Truth in Television, too. Most of the content of those songs was taken from the Adams' actual letters to each other — and John did, indeed, sign multiple letters as "Yours, yours, yours".
    -   Tom misses his wife so much that he has a crippling case of Writer's Block when he's unable to visit her, so Adams has to ask her to come to Philadelphia—where they immediately fall into each other's arms (and then bed).

-   A few of the vignettes in _I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change_ have these kind of couples, namely "Whatever Happened To Baby's Parents", "Sex and The Married Couple" and the untitled one featuring the song "Shouldn't I Be Less In Love With You?" It's indicated that the couple in "Wedding Vows" will be this since, despite some initial last minute panicking, they go through with the wedding because they sincerely love each other.
-   _Macbeth_: Lord and Lady Macbeth. Yes, they brought doom and damnation upon themselves together, but they loved and supported each other along the way (though Lady Macbeth could get a little mean in her "supporting"...).

-   Wintergreen and Mary in _Of Thee I Sing_, who get married in the first act finale and stay resolutely together through the sequel _Let 'Em Eat Cake_.
-   It can be taken that Dionysus and Ariadne had this sort of marriage in _The Frogs_, considering how Dionysus describes their time together: "And the years filled with joy/And my heart filled with pride/Just to know Ariadne was there at my side." And when he's in the Underworld, struggling to figure out who the best playwright to bring back to Earth with him is, Ariadne shows up to comfort him and help him find the answer.
-   Chris and Ellen in _Miss Saigon_. While he clearly loved Kim during the first half of the show, Ellen is the one he wants to build a life with, and she is supportive and accepting of the idea that he has a son by another woman.
-   Kristina and Karl Oskar in "_Kristina from Duvemåla_". They even have several songs about it, with lines such as "_It is cold and empty// when you've shared everything// and are made to be apart_" and "_We shall be together when day adds to day// For where you go, I go as well_". Karl Oskar also has a song, "_Stay_", in which he describes how much his wife (who is at that point very ill from scurvy and might not make it through the night) means to him. The musical depicts their initial courtship and early years of marriage, their decision to be the first in their parish to emigrate from Sweden to the US in the mid 1840s, and building a new life for themselves and their six children in Minnesota.
-   _Show Boat_:
    -   Steve and Julie were this until they leave the show and he leaves her. The song "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" shows this (Julie: "Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, I gotta love one man till I die...")
    -   Joe and Queenie. She's frustrated with him for being so lazy, but their part in the same song makes it clear that they're still very much in love with each other.

-   Erika and Matt of _DAR!: A Super Girly Top Secret Comic Diary_, both in the webcomic _and_ in real life. Erika herself says that her years with Matt have been the happiest time of her life.

-   Fox and Collin of _Friendly Hostility_. Fox's parents (and Rafi) have been happy together for decades.
-   _Girl Genius_:
    -   Master Payne and the countess may have the occasional argument, as can be expected of a couple trying to keep themselves and their circus troop alive in the dangerous wastelands, but even their arguments generally devolve into flirting and they do whatever they can to keep each other happy and relatively safe.
    -   Old Man Death and the wild princess both stepped away from their former wild lives in order to spend the rest of them together in their youth and are still deeply enamored and happy with each other in their old age, though she never did like his ubiquitous hat so she'll be pleased Maxim tricked him out of it.

-   In _Grrl Power_, it turns out that team lawyer Arianna has been married to financial adviser Aurelius Shrapnel for fourteen years, though they don't bother mentioning it to anyone who doesn't ask. Presumably they're both happy with it to last that length of time; it's notable that, when everyone in the base is affected by a magical lust effect, and most of them jump the nearest person of their gender of choice, Arianna's response is to call Aurelius to come into the office ASAP.
-   In _Koan of the Day_, the tortoises meet each other, fall in love, get married, and while one tortoise messes with the other, they're both very happy.

-   In _The Red Star_: Maya and her husband deeply loved each other As seen in this speech about the joys of love and married life.
-   Mr. and Mrs. Cake from _Slice of Life_, just like their cartoon counterparts. They shamelessly refer to each other with cutesy nicknames in public, and never get angry or frustrated with each other, even when dealing with their more troublesome customers or suppliers.
    
    **Mrs. Cake:** "Well, let's get this over with, ginger-beer."  
    **Mr. Cake:** "We should probably knock, sugarpie."  
    **Mrs. Cake:** "Oh, one of us should, toffeebean."  
    **Mr. Cake:** "Sometime soon, fizzypop."
    
-   Fred and Faye MacIntire, Davan's parents from _Something\*Positive_. Faye dies peacefully of old age, and since most characters are based on the cartoonist's life, his mom started looking at him funny. The strip after this had the tagline at the bottom: "I got a very annoyed voicemail from my mother today. I wonder why?"
    -   Also Aubrey and Jason; they are also based on real people, though those people are not a couple in real life.

-   _The Journal Entries_ contain a surprising number of these, considering most of the characters are immortal bisexuals who either don't have a real concept of monogamy or abandoned it long ago <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  The implication in universe is that so many characters have stable long-term relationships because the culture does not expect anything specific beyond not being evil; not being able to handle it when your lover beds someone else is seen as a failing on your part.
-   Dan and Marc in _you could make a life_ are a married couple in all but name long before they officially tie the knot. They do face their share of obstacles, but their love for each other always remains the greatest constant in their lives.

-   Twitch streamer _The 8-Bit Drummer_ is this with his wife and fellow Twitch streamer, Chatia.
-   Citation Needed: In season 2 episode 5, concerning the Flitch of Bacon, it's explained that you only receive the flitch of bacon if you have never regretted your marriage during a year and a day. Panelist Gary Brannan had this to say:

**Gary:** Well, put it this way: I am due me some bacon!

-   In the first campaign of _Critical Role_, Kima and Allura as well as Percy and Vex got married at some point over the Time Skip, both couples having endured great hardship together, and are delighted and relieved to be able to settle down by the story's end. Nott the Brave/Veth Brenatto of Campaign 2 turns out to be married to fellow halfling Yeza and they adore each other, and in _Critical Role: Exandria Unlimited_, we find out that Shaun Gilmore is in a loving marriage to an elven man named Darius.
-   This is painfully subverted and possibly even deconstructed with _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_. Goku is a complete and total idiot who disappears at the drop of a hat and only thinks of food and fighting. Unlike his anime counterpart, this causes incredible strain towards his family, especially since he tends to treat Gohan as a non-entity and puts Chi-Chi through incredible strain by his child-like actions. It finally reaches a head with _Broly the Legendary Super Saiyan_, where an exasperated Chi-Chi, having paid Gohan's College tuition through the nose and upset at the fact that Goku both left her and _doesn't seem to care at all_, tells him that she wants a divorce.
-   _Doug Funnie in Adult Life_: Near the end of the film, one of Doug's students asks him how everything went with Patti. The camera immediately pans to a wedding ring on Doug's finger.
-   In a world where the Critic was never born, The Nostalgia Chick would have been a sweet, well-adjusted, hugely successful director with a baby and a husband.
-   _StephenVlog_: Stephen Georg and his wife, Mallory, fit this trope to a T. Often times, it's hard to remember that Stephen and Mal are married because their personalities are so distinctly defined, as well as how their dynamic with each other feels natural and not something to play up.
