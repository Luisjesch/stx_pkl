This is where mecha, robots, or anything similar have lower legs and forearms bigger than the corresponding thighs and upper arms, as if they had giant bracers and boots on, or bell-bottom pants from The '70s.

There's a few various reasons for this trope. One of the most common is the prevalence of robots with Rocket Boots or various arm mounted weaponry on their forearms. Another reason is the prevalence of Shoulders of Doom or hip-plates on many robots, whose great size leaves less room for the upper arms and thighs respectively, while the forearms and lower legs are free to look bulkier. This can be accentuated further by a Mecha Expansion Pack, where the extremities are free to be armored up while the more heavily-jointed shoulders and hips need to be unobstructed.

And from an artistic standpoint, it can either come across as a convenient or a lazy design choice if drawing hands and feet comes of as time-consuming without covering them. Alternatively, it can also convey stability; indeed, some Mecha drawing guides recommend making the bottom bigger than the top for precisely this reason. If there are toys based on the robot (or, alternatively, if the robot is based on a toy), then that artistic stability can double as actual real-world stability.

Contrast Top-Heavy Guy whose overall body is disproportionate and Creepily Long Arms for arms that are unusually long, compare Chicken Walker for another popular form of Robotic Legs. See also Fingerless Hands, which is the organic version of this.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Astro Boy_, many of the male robots have thick legs and forearms. Astro himself is an example if you count his boots. Epsilon who is a female robot also has them and still looks feminine in them since hers resemble arm warmers/leg warmers.
-   The classic _Gundam_ is a good example. Its lower legs are notably larger and more complex than the upper legs, it's less noticeable but still there with the arms. Some of the robots were designed to be more bottom-heavy, i.e., to shift their gravity center lower; most notably, the Dom has massive lower legs and feet with the justification that it has jets built into them that allow it to hover at high speeds over the surface of the Earth.
-   In _Mazinger Z_, the titular mecha has these gauntlet/greaves thing going on its arms and legs. So do its successors, _Great Mazinger_ and _UFO Robo Grendizer_.
-   In _One Piece_, Franky the cyborg has big, inflated forearms which become even bigger and boxy after the Time Skip. Justified in that he puts many things in there, such as ammunition, a long chain, a shield, and a box of tools.
-   The Ingrams in _Patlabor_ are a strong example, having extremely large lower legs, the right one containing a compartment for storing a scaled-up revolver, and short, minimalistic thighs. This is explicitly in the interest of keeping their centre of gravity low so they don't tip over, which is **the** primary design concern with a humanoid mech that is two stories tall and meant to operate in an urban environment.
-   All three _Robot Romance Trilogy_ animes have these. _Voltes V_, _Daimos_, _Combattler V_ all have forearms and legs that are armored with armlets and greaves.

    Toys 

-   _Transformers_: The majority are examples, often with Kibble attached to their lower arms, while upper arm Kibble usually turns into Shoulders of Doom detached from the arm. In toys with this, it's Enforced since it's literally impossible to have the upper arm bigger, if the shoulder pad and upper arm are supposed to be flush with the lower arm when transformed. Similarly, many toys have larger lower legs than upper legs due to it being common for the toy's lower legs to fold over their upper legs in vehicle mode. The lower legs are usually incorporated into the toy's vehicle mode appearance, while the upper legs wind up being internal.

    Tabletop Games 

    Video Games 

-   Lasertrons in _Fallout 4_ have these for their legs, making them look as if they wore platform shoes, especially when the voices and the personas of the robots the player is able to meet in the Commonwealth are feminine.
-   _Mega Man (Classic)_: Mega Man is more notable in artwork than in games but it's there in both. In some cases, his lower legs and forearms might be _twice_ as thick as the arms attached, which usually look like blue tights.
-   _Mighty No. 9_, the Spiritual Successor of _Mega Man_, naturally has these for its robot designs. Beck, Mighty No. 1, and Mighty No. 5 have large forelegs. Mighty No. 4 has large forearms.
-   Many of the robotic characters from _Sonic the Hedgehog_ heavily feature this design. Notable examples include almost the entire E-Series robots, especially E-102 Gamma and E-123 Omega, Emerl, Gemerl and the Gizoids, Metal Sonic (most prominently in his transformed state in _Sonic Heroes_), and Johnny from _Sonic Rush Adventure_.

    Webcomics 

-   _Schlock Mercenary_: Lieutenant Foxworthy temporarily becomes a bell-bottomed Cyborg after an explosion severs her legs. The field hospital has a roboticist with spare Powered Armor parts but no body-part printer, so she spends some time with feet larger than her torso.
    
    **Foxworthy:** I'm _tall._
    

    Western Animation 

-   _Green Lantern: The Animated Series_:
    -   In the episode "Steam Lantern", Duke Nigel's mechanoids are designed with this style in mind.
    -   Other more Downplayed examples include the Anti-monitor and Aya, whose limbs are only slightly larger at the ends.
    -   The Manhunters avert this, having more normal proportions.
-   _Megas XLR_: Megas, the Glorft mechs, and pretty much all of the humanoid mechs fall under this trope.
-   _My Life as a Teenage Robot_ shows Jenny with uniform hose-style arms, but she has bell bottom legs with no feet.
-   _Samurai Jack_: The Mondo Bot's hands and feet are proportionally very large but has comparatively skinny upper arms and thighs, this actually proves to be a massive design flaw as after Jack has merged with a magic stone giant he easily snaps his arms and legs with a single chop.
-   The high-tech gem Peridot from _Steven Universe_ has arms and legs that flare out from the knees and elbows like bell-bottoms and flared sleeves. When she joins up with the Crystal Gems in season two, it's revealed that these parts of her limbs are actually removable robotic extensions and not actually part of her real body, which is much smaller and has normal humanoid hands and fingers.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)_ has Professor Honeycutt, a.k.a. The Fugitoid, who falls cleanly under this.
