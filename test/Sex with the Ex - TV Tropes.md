A night with an old flame is Elektra-fying.

"_It was just ex-sex. It's a totally normal thing that everyone does after they break up."_

Two characters that used to be a couple broke up. They got bored of each other or argued too much, he just wouldn't put the seat down, she used too much toilet paper, whatever. Emotionally or mentally they didn't think they were right for each other. Sexually, however, they still get along just fine.

They may only get to kissing each other or get further than that, but as long as they're reinitiating a physical relationship it's fair game. It can naturally take on a variety of forms, as people are complicated; it may just be sex and friendship, it may be a pattern of hooking up, swearing to never see each other again, and hooking up again, or they could go back into a relationship.

May lead to getting back together, particularly if it starts after a separation or after they've moved on to other people for added drama/comedy. Naturally, a common sitcom trope.

Subtrope of Amicable Exes, where they're _really_ amiable. Supertrope to New Old Flame. May lead to a Relationship Revolving Door situation.

-   "Thnks Fr Th Mmrs" by Fall Out Boy is, per Word of God, about two people who have broken up but continue to sleep together to sate their physical and mental desires.
-   Olivia Rodrigo's "bad idea right?" is about this. She admits that she knows it's a bad idea (right?) that will likely reawaken her feelings for her ex, but in the end, she decides "fuck it, it's fine."
    
    Yes, I know that he's my ex  
    But can't two people reconnect?  
    I only see him as a friend  
    The biggest lie I ever said

    Theatre 

-   In _Mary Mary_, Tiffany accuses Bob of having slept with his ex-wife Mary, whom he obviously remains attracted to, though he insists that he's the sort of Nice Guy who just wouldn't do such a thing.

When Bender finds out that Anglelyne is Flexo's ex-wife (but still apparently has feelings for him), he decides to see just how far the feelings go, disguising himself as Flexo (easy to do, needing only a small fake beard) and taking Anglelyne out for a night on the town. Unfortunately, this does indeed make Anglelyne remember how much she loved Flexo — but even more unfortunate, this gets the real Flexo in trouble, as the Robot Mafia - who is supporting the strikers - drops an unbendable girder on Flexo to punish him for flaunting his success. Bender starts to feel sympathy for both of them, and he decides to try and bend the girder off of Flexo ("Well, I don't know anything about lifting, so we don't have many options here!") and actually succeeds, after which Anglelyne and Flexo apparently make love right there, with Bender still in the room.
