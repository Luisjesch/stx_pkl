This is when sexual intercourse and other sexual activities are referred to by code words. This type of euphemism is usually used by adults, especially when near children or in a work targeting children, though they may also use sexual euphemisms when discussing the topic with a friend or family member. Many of these euphemisms come from common language and, in certain cases, can be totally innocent. As such, this may overlap with Innocent Innuendo if it turns out the "euphemism" was literal.

These euphemisms can be part of a character's humor or their schtick, and depending on the specific euphemism, it could establish their character as a lewd pervert, someone who's comfortable with their sexuality, or someone who has enough wit to talk about these things in polite society. In some cases, pink is used to highlight these elements as a visual aid or to highlight it.

Some common euphemisms for sex include: one thing, this and that, making love, the nasty, doing the do, getting lucky, getting laid, doing the horizontal tango, dancing, woohooing, making whoopee, and literally hundreds more. Some common euphemisms for other sexual activities include: choking the chicken, crying bald man, beating the meat, strangling the cyclops, menage a moi, and countless others. Can sometimes overlap with I Need to Iron My Dog if one or both of the characters make an excuse to be alone together.

This is a supertrope to Get Thee to a Nunnery, which is when the sexual euphemism is no longer understood as such, though it _used to be_. This may overlap with Intercourse with You, which is a song about sex with or without euphemisms; Getting Crap Past the Radar, when euphemisms are used to include otherwise inappropriate talk; Technical Euphemism, when the euphemism uses technical jargon; and Double Entendre, when an innocent phrase has a double meaning related to sex. If used as names, they are Euphemistic Names. Also see The Body Parts That Must Not Be Named, when someone uses euphemisms for the sex organs. This is a sister trope to Unusual Euphemism, which is when a character makes up a euphemism for sex because they're made uncomfortable by the subject. Contrast Imagined Innuendo for when something is _not_ intended as a euphemism for sex but a character interprets it as one, which overlaps when a term turns into this. Accidental Innuendo is when the author didn't intend it either. See also Innocent Innuendo and Heh Heh, You Said "X". See also Gay Euphemism which is about avoiding direct usage of homosexuality-related terms.

-   _Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch_:
    -   In the manga, Lucia is giving one of several love confessions gone wrong, and Kaito jokes about "this and that", causing Lucia to yell at him while he laughs it off.

    **Onizuka:** Oh, Urumi!!! I'll help you fill the well! Oh, yes!
    
-   A _lot_ of "this" and a _lot_ of "that" is exactly what Aizen Teppa from _Grenadier_ tries to get. He's apparently quite successful too (Episodes 11 and 12 show that he's quite popular among the ladies of the town)...except when it comes to his good friend, Rushuna.

-   _Junjou Romantica_ has Usagi-san saying "this and that" when talking about what he and Misaki get up to when they're together.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Used in the second movie, where the mooks that are about to kidnap Nami so the Big Bad can forcibly marry her say out loud that they hope they'll be able to watch their boss do "this" and "that" to her. The horrified looks on the crew's faces when they hear them are priceless.
    -   Later, Sanji hoped to have this with Nami, on a consensual basis of course, after he would have rescued her.

-   During their first training in the Shuuren no Mon, Dorothy realizes that Ginta and Snow are paired together and could be doing 'This and that'. She later gets extremely angry when she finds out that their meeting was a kiss.

-   In _Fruits Basket_, Kyo is engaged in a martial arts battle with his cousin Hatsuharu's violent Split Personality, "Black Haru", who threatens to do "some of this, and some of that" to Tohru if Kyo loses.

-   Played with/subverted in _Fairy Tail_. During the Lullaby Arc Lucy is told by Erza to go find Natsu and Gray. She gets lost and frustrated, and decides to stop looking... then Happy looks shocked and says that she must be brave, to defy Erza. He then wonders what will happen when Erza does "this and that" to Lucy, and Lucy freaks out, saying "What is she going to do to me!!??" It's implied, however, that the threat was not sexual in nature, and was more of a 'she'll beat you up, horribly' deal. It never is revealed what Erza really would have done, though...
-   In _Azumanga Daioh_, Nyamo, of all people, gets blitzed and gives a lecture on "this and that" to the girls, with reactions ranging from horrified to amazed to downright intrigued. And, the morning after, when Chiyo innocently comes to ask her about the things she didn't understand about said lecture... Let's just say it's **priceless**. And the fact that the speech is muted while relaxing music plays in the background when they talk about these things only makes it funnier.
-   In _The Pet Girl of Sakurasou_, Sorata assumes Jin and Misaki must be doing this when he, Mashiro, and Nanami arrive back at Sakura Hall at the end of episode 14. Turns out they aren't, and a distraught Misaki greets them by the front door, wearing only a towel.
-   Towards the end of _Blast of Tempest_, Yoshino off-handedly mentions he did this and that with Aika, which prompts Mahiro to demand an explanation. However we never really find out if Yoshino actually did make love to Aika, or if he was just saying that to get a rise out of Mahiro.
-   In _Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches_, talking about sex is alright (in moderate doses, of course - it _is_ a Shōnen series), but saying the word itself is for some reason no-go, so the characters always talk about "this and that" or "that stuff". The only exception is when Takuma gives Yamada and Shiraishi the very direct order "have sex" for comic surprise effect.
-   In the first episode of _Massugu ni Ikou_, Mametarou thinks his owner and her boyfriend are going to do "this and that". He freaks out and decides he needs to protect Iku. It turns out they're just going on a first date.
-   _Shimoneta_ is all about this. In a boring world where the concept of dirty jokes doesn't exist, this trope applies to this dystopic version of Japan when people have to talk about sex but they can't, first because most of society has been controlled by the government so if they say censored words or actions is equal to going to jail, as well as teenagers and young people are ignorant of sexual education, so everyone talks about sex in euphemisms.
-   _The Testament of Sister New Devil_: One of the major plot points of the series is that of the Master-Servant Pact, a magical contract between two (or more) people that makes one bound to obey and serve the other. Violating the pact, or even _thinking_ about violating it, causes the spell to activate and punish the servant. The nature of the punishment can vary, but almost all versions, due to the contract being created by a succubus, are shown in this series cause the servant to go into overpowering sexual desire. Thus, the protagonists always use the term "relief" to mean sexual contact (though not specifically intercourse).
-   In _Bloom Into You_, Rei thinks to herself that she and her boyfriend Hiro were "doing this, that and the other thing" before they were officially dating, something she's unwilling to admit to her younger sister, Yuu.

    Art 

-   _Nymphs and Satyr_: Considering the history between satyrs and nymphs, their playfulness probably goes beyond chaste. The Clarke Institute's analysis seems to think that the metaphor could be much darker, with the pond representing the act itself, the nymphs are "trying to dampen the satyr's ardor by pulling him into the cold water -- one of the satyr's hooves is already wet and he clearly wants to go no further." Considering satyrs are famous for being the horny bastards preying on nymphs, this can be seen as a case of Hoist by His Own Petard and The Hunter Becomes the Hunted.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Next Men_, the superhumans are also secluded from society when the story starts. They were taught the word for sex was "dancing" — and that it was a very intimate thing between loved ones only — so it causes them some culture shock when people casually make dates to go out dancing.
-   _Ultimate Spider-Man_: Aunt May prevented Peter and MJ from having sex, reminded them to be "safe", and asked if he already had The Talk with Ben or needs more information. All without using any specific terms.

    Fan Works 

-   In _The Prayer Warriors_, the villains in "Battle With the Witches" seemingly refer to sex as "satanic rituals." The heroes have terms of their own, as seen in this description of Draco and Ebony having sex.
    
    **Narration**: Draco and Ebony removed the skin from an onion. After that, they put Draco\`s noodles into Ebony\`s bowl, and Draco then planted some seeds into Ebony\`s pot, and then they laid on their bed for the rest the night. They were very tired from all that hard work.
    
-   _Fever Dreams_: when Light tells L "I like it when you investigate me."
-   From _Legally Damned_: "They hopped onto the squishy bed as Ryuk unscrewed the lightbulb."
-   From the Crack Fic _The Black Bunny_:
    
    **George:** Draco, I wanna release my basilisk into your chamber of secrets.
    
-   From _The Dark Lord's Protector_:
    
    _While Bella was the most affected, the brothers always to advantage and made lingering touches, and innuendoes such, "my meatballs are bigger then this and tastier" courtesy of Rabastan and "My breadstick is longer and thicker" courtesy of Rodolphus.  
    What sent Bella over this time was when her lovers dipped both of their breadsticks in her pasta, saying "We wanted to taste your sauce."_
    
-   From _Harry Potter and the Something Something_:
    
    **Snape:** Not too long after we graduated from Hogwarts, I realized what a fool I'd been in letting Lily leave me on such horrible terms. I managed to seek her out before she and James went into hiding, and I convinced her to forgive me.  
    **Harry:** Lovely.  
    **Snape:** Then she forgave me again the next morning.  
    **Harry:** Dude.  
    **Snape:** Twice.
    
-   In _A Necessary Gift_ Sirius comments that he hopes to get lucky at a Beltane ceremony. Remus objects to this remark because a ten-year-old alternate-universe Harry (who's pretending to be Sirius' nonexistent son Orion) is standing right there.
    
    **Sirius:** Orion's old enough to know about the quills and the inkpots, Remus.
    
-   In _Dearest Hermione_ Sirius tries to give Harry The Talk, due to his doubts that the Dursleys would ever have discussed "the flowers and the fairies."
-   In _The Greengrass Contract_ Angelina Johnson offers to teach Harry about "kissing and some other stuff."
    
    **Harry:** It's okay, Angelina - I know all about parking the hot rod in the garage.
    
-   In _Breakfast_ Harry's son Jamie insists on dressing up as a cereal box for Halloween, with Ginny as a bottle of milk and Harry as the bowl and spoon.
    
    **Ginny:** You know, if we tire him out with trick-or-treating, he'll go to bed sooner. We could always leave that bowl of candy on the front porch and you could dip your spoon into my milk after we put him to bed.  
    **Harry:** I'm kind of hungry. I think I'd want two bowls of cereal tonight.  
    **Ginny:** I think I have enough milk for three bowls at least.
    
-   One of the villains in _The Private Diary of Elizabeth Quatermain_ speaks of his upcoming marriage as being the means to an end, saying that "I just have to take the blush off your English rose" in order to achieve it. As he's talking to the man who is genuinely in love with the bride, this is quite possibly the worst pressing of a Berserk Button in the entire series.
-   _Advice and Trust_: A bunch of them:
    -   Asuka tells Shinji that he is not getting an "Israfel Special" with Rei and her (meaning a threesome). Quickly the "Israfel Special" expression becomes a Running Gag.
    -   Later in chapter 5 Shinji considers that he and Asuka are pretty vocal when "entangling their AT-Fields".
    -   During that scene, Asuka tells him "Now get your 'Positron Rifle' into 'firing position', quickly." as an euphemism for sex.
-   _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_ and its Expanded Universe has people reference one night stands that lead to pregnancy as having 'daycared'.
-   In _Osomatsu-san_ fanfics, some fans like to have Jyuushimatsu use "Seicross" as a euphemism for sex thanks to his introduction in episode 1.
-   One piece of _Resident Evil 4_ fanart has Ashley propositioning Leon using phrases like "I want you to plant every seed in your apple bag into my fertile valley" and "be my Major General Robert Ross, and burn my White House down".
-   In the _RWBY_ fic _Pyrrha(c) victory_, Yang jokes that Pyrrha and Jaune's combat training sessions are really sexual euphemisms.
-   Nora ran betting rings in _RWBY: Reckoning_ based on when Darrel and Yang would progress through a relationship, with the last one being when the two would "boop".
-   _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ has "getting under one's hat" as a Smurf euphemism for sex.
-   _A Very Titans Christmas_ uses the expression "The deed of a thousand euphemisms".
-   _Psychedelic Epiphany Series_: _Yearly Epiphany_ From _Year 0: Hearthswarming Epiphany_:
    
    you know... married couples like to engage in the totality of their relationship for mutual comprehension and growth of pleasure?"  
    "...Yes, I am aware of sex." Willow paused.
    
-   In the _Bones_ fic “Man Cave Defiled”, Booth uses a play on “hide the salami” saying Sweets was playing “hide the little smokey” in his man cave. Brennan asks if it shouldn’t be “hide the salami” and Booth replies “it’s Sweets, there’s no salami involved”.
-   In _Bitter Repercussions_, Fireheart gets embarrassed when Bluestar mentions that it took long enough for Sandstorm to get pregnant. He questions whether Bluestar's suggesting he and Sandstorm should have been doing "this and that" for months.
-   Whisper the Wolf drags Silver the Hedgehog to her house for "the important mission".
    
    **Blaze**: Why are Silver and Whisper spending more time together?
    
    **Sonic** and **Tangle**: The fucking mini Silvers are coming.
    
-   _The Mountain and the Wolf_: The Wolf believes that Jon and Grey Worm are Daenerys' lovers (the former was, but it turns out they're related, the latter is a eunuch), and at one point leaves them with this classy line:
    
    "Bet that's one dragon's belly you're eager to stab your spears into, eh?"
    
-   When Bruno has his vision when confronted by Tuffnut in _The Dragon and the Butterfly_, he asks him if he wants to know "what \[his\] sister's gonna be doing in a couple years". He then points to Fishlegs.
-   _Momentary Weakness_: Nia uses a few of these when telling Noah the story of Mio's conception.
    
    **Nia:** So we're all being with each other, goin' on adventures and being so in love it’s frankly sickening. One day though, Mythra's annoyed.  
    **Noah:** She's... annoyed?  
    **Nia:** Yeah, not with us, mind! But she's angry and frustrated an' just needed some angry se—ah, what I mean to say is... she sought solace in intimacy. _\[blushes\]_ An abundance of solace.  
    **Noah:** ...angry ...solace?  
    **Nia:** _\[defensive\]_ It's great stress relief! So she ordered us all into th' bedroom and just f—ah, found pleasure in our company. Repeatedly.
    
-   In the _Marvel Cinematic Universe_ fanfic _The Artist's Garden at Madripoor_, Steve goes to Madripoor in order to acquire the last component for the Quantum Tunnel and discovers that Sharon is the Power Broker, the city's Judge, Jury, and Executioner. She refuses to give him the component unless he hands over his shield or Sam's wings (which she stole for him and led to her becoming a fugitive) as well as more or less stating that she's largely uninterested in bringing back everyone who disappeared in the Snap because it could threaten her position. When Steve angrily asks what happened to the woman he used to know, Sharon bitterly fires back that "That woman died when \[he\] abandoned her," causing Steve to feel anger and guilt for failing to find her and causing her fall from grace. Steve is eventually able to convince her to give them the component on a few conditions, one of which is attending a party she's throwing. Later, she drops a few of these:
-   In _Designated Duty_, when Steve sees Sharon getting ready for a girls' night with Natasha and Wanda, he offers her his jacket to which Sharon responds that she'll wear it to bed tonight, flustering Steve. Wanda thinks to herself on why someone would wear a jacket to sleep. At the end of the story, when Wanda is messaging Vision, she asks for a reason as to why someone would wear a jacket to bed. Vision, not getting the social cue either, thinks its because of the cold.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _The Breakfast Club_: Bender grosses out Claire by describing "a game of hide the salami" and suggesting she wants "the hot beef injection".
-   In _Captain America: The First Avenger_, Cap misinterprets Howard Stark's question to Peggy Carter for late-night fondue as one of these. Howard clarifies later:
    
    **Howard**: Agent Carter, if we're not in too much of a hurry I thought we could stop off in Lucerne for a late night fondue.  
    ...  
    **Howard**: It's just cheese and bread, my friend.
    
-   _Demolition Man_. While talking with Officer Huxley about sex, John Spartan calls it "boning", the "wild mambo" and the "hunka chunka".
-   Part of a Running Gag in _Idiocracy_ is that Joe never catches on to Rita's euphemism.
-   In _Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects_ when Detective Crowe's daughter has a man stick his hand up her skirt on a public bus she exclaims that someone has touched her "holy of holies!"
-   _The Mask_. When the Mask meets Tina Carlyle in the park, he tries to seduce her by saying (in an outrageous French accent) "I will spread your pate" and "I will dip my ladle in your vichyssoise".
-   In _Mean Girls_, Kevin confuses new student Cady Heron by asking her if "you muffin buttered?" and "would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?". Then The Plastics step in and tell him to leave Cady alone.
-   In _None Shall Escape_, Wilhelm says to Willie that the Polish women are there to work for the Nazis and for "recreational purposes".
-   _The Star Maker_: Beata is desperate to go away with Joe. Offering him all sorts of sexual services, she says "I'll draw your milk" and reaches for his crotch. Joe refuses.
-   _Tango and Cash_ has Stallone's character making reference to "bumping uglies".
-   _Weird Science_: Chet irritates Lisa by telling her he wants to "butter her muffin".
-   _Elvira, Mistress of the Dark_ is a Hurricane of Puns, but one of the most memorable is after the titular character has hit her head on a movie marquee:
    
    **Bob:** "How's your head?"  
    **Elvira:** "Well, I've never had any complaints..."
    

    Literature 

-   _The Decameron_ uses "put the Devil back into Hell", which is a not-at-all-subtle euphemism for sex when you consider that Rustico calls his penis "the Devil" and Alibech's vagina "Hell".
-   In the _Everworld_ book "Gateway to the Gods", Aphrodite does this while mocking Athena for her celibate nature, though in this case she's not trying to be coy about sexual topics (she's the _goddess_ of sexual love, after all) but rather being deliberately lewd just to troll her fellow Olympian.
    
    **Aphrodite:** She knows nothing of love. She loves men only as babbling philosophers or deadly warriors. How strange, that she should love both the tongue and the sword... _(very deliberate dramatic pause)_ ...and yet she partakes of neither the tongue nor the sword.
    
-   Unlike in the film adaptation where the term is used literally, "playing pattycake" in _Who Censored Roger Rabbit?_ is used as slang for sex.
-   In _Patience and Sarah_, the two leads either don't know any words for sex or choose to use euphemisms due to the 1810s setting. They refer to it with terms such as "melting" and "Heaven".
-   In _To Shape a Dragon's Breath_ after Masquisit and Nasquisit whalers come home from months away at sea, their children are encouraged the day after the return celebration to keep themselves occupied elsewhere until sunset, so their wives can welcome the whalers home "in their own way". This is said matter-of-factly, as sex is not considered a big deal.
-   "Dragon-snaking" is used as a euphemism for sex more than once in _The Wicked Years_

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, Agent Ward confesses to Agent Coulson that he 'did that' with Agent May. Coulson, who knew this already, states matter-of-factly, that she preferred to simply call it sex.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_
    -   In a bid to make up with Oz, Willow has him over to watch videos. He finds her in the darkened lounge wearing a slinky red dress, Barry White playing in the background and a bottle of lemonade in an ice bucket, which she'd set up in preparation of wanting to "do that thing." The whole setup shows Willow isn't quite as mature as she's trying to be, so Oz turns down the offer until Willow is truly ready.
    -   Averted in a later episode which takes place after Willow has lost her virginity.
        
        **Willow:** What does it mean when a girl wants to... You know.  
        **Xander:** If you're doin' it, I think you should be able to say it.  
        **Willow:** Make love.
        
    -   The Mayor wants Faith to move out of the No-Tell Motel she's staying in because there are "immoral liaisons" going on there. Being Book Dumb Faith replies, "Yeah, plus all the screwing."
-   _The Dating Game_ popularized "making whoopee".
-   _Fellow Travelers_: Hawkins Fuller alludes to his promiscuity when he informs Mary Johnson, "I have trouble finishing a book before I want to start another."
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_:
    -   "In Throes of Increasing Wonder...": While confessing his sins to Father Matthias, Louis de Pointe du Lac relies on a horticultural analogy when he divulges that he bottomed for Lestat de Lioncourt when they had sex, and even hints that his lover has a large penis (which Lestat asserts in "A Vile Hunger for Your Hammering Heart"). Louis compares himself to the soil while Lestat is the plant that's "sprouting" within him.
        
        **Louis**: I-I laid down with a man. I laid down with the Devil. And \[Lestat\] has roots in me, all his spindly <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  roots in me!
        
    -   "Is My Very Nature That of a Devil": After being Mistaken for Gay by Antoinette Brown, Lestat alludes that he's bisexual and promiscuous with music terminology. She then implies that she also shares his sexual orientation and is attracted to women (alongside men).
        
        **Lestat**: Still, what do you imagine confines us to a single note? Why not a chord? Why not a cluster?  
        **Antoinette**: Oh, see, I'm the same. I like all sorts. I like soft hands.
        
    -   "...The Ruthless Pursuit of Blood with All a Child's Demanding": Lestat uses arithmetic — a topic that most people would consider to be utterly unsexy — as a metaphor for sex when he attempts to teach Claudia about what humans do at a Make-Out Point.
        
        **Lestat**: This is what the meat calls a "lover's lane," and by my estimation, no blood is sweeter. Young people, swollen with passion, denied spirits by this senseless prohibition, park along this lonely stretch to contemplate that most mysterious of mathematical equations — how one plus one becomes one.  
        **Claudia**: They come out here to do math?  
        **Lestat**: You've been too sheltered.
        
-   The "Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook" sketch from _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ has these gem:
    
    "Do you want to come back to my place, bouncy-bouncy?"
    
    -   There's also the "Nudge, nudge, wink, wink, say no more!" sketch, where Eric Idle speaks entirely in euphemisms. "Is your wife a goer, eh? Eh? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink, say no more!"
-   _Seinfeld_
    -   A slightly different example was Jerry and Elaine talking about their relationship, making references to "this", with a forward-and-backward hand motion, implying a conversational, friendly relationship, and "that", with a hand motion towards Jerry's bedroom, implying a sexual relationship. Elaine decides at the end that she wants, "this", "that", and "the other" (love).
    -   Then there's "yada yada yada", which George's girlfriend uses to cover up all manner of things when telling stories, which it turns out includes sex.
-   _Veronica Mars_: In the first season episode "Ruskie Business", Veronica and Meg go to the sheriff's department for a stop Veronica needs to make, which Meg doesn't understand until she sees Veronica and Leo (a deputy) looking at each other.

-   _Yes, Minister_: In "Party Games", Hacker hears about a sex scandal involving one of his cabinet colleagues, and remarks "To look at him, you wouldn't think he had the time for all this..." before trying to find a suitable euphemism. Sir Humphrey suggests "horizontal jogging".

    Music 

-   _This and That_ by Michael Penn
-   "Ball of Kirriemuir" uses this a couple of times while otherwise using extremely graphic language.
    
    The village idiot he was there,  
    Up to this and that,  
    Amusing himself by abusing himself,  
    And catching it in his hat.
    
-   "Makin' Whoopee", a 1928 song by Eddie Cantor that came from the musical _Whoopee!_

    Mythology & Religion 

-   In the more formal equivalent (word-for-word) translations of _The Bible_, "knowing" tends to be used in places where its intended meaning is that the characters are having (or wanting) sex. Although it may be a case where it is more than just a euphemism for sex, that it is actually having intimate relations (whether physical or otherwise) with the other person.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Fraggle Rock_: In one episode, Pa tells Junior that he and Ma are going to frolic in the creek.
    
    **Ma:** Cooling the ankles cools the mind!  
    **Junior:** Oh, well, my ankles could use some cooling, too. I'll come along!  
    **Pa:** _\[quickly\]_ Uh, no! No, no! Not... not until you finish watering the garden.
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Maid RPG_ always refers to sex as variations on terms of vagueness throughout the rulebooks. For example, from a replay:
    
    **GM:** Ahhh. I see how it is. That's pretty handy. "Doing That Thing"! Heheheh. Vampires do vampiric activities, and humans do \[censored\] activities. OK! OK!
    

    Theatre 

-   The musical _A Chorus Line_ features a song titled "Dance: Ten, Looks: Three". Frequently, high school performing arts programs decide they want to perform this musical and are forced to change the lyrics to placate the parents' groups. What do they usually change the lyrics to, so as to best match the rhythm and sound of the original words? "This and That." (Which, considering what that's taken to mean, implies that the Bowdlerized lyrics got even _racier._)
-   In _Jasper in Deadland_, Gretchen refers to sex as "tappin' it", Beatrix Portinari refers to sex as "bada-bing" or "being boned", Agnes calls it "You know...", and Jasper after losing his memory uses the phrase "bang one out". Jasper and Agnes also use a variety of euphemisms right before Their First Time.
-   _Othello_: Iago tells Brabantio, Senator of Venice, that "your daughter (Desdemona) and the Moor (Othello) are now making the beast with two backs."

    Video Games 

-   In RPG/sim hybrid _Azure Dreams_ (PSX version), after teenage hero Koh finally gets a Relationship Upgrade by turning Girl Next Door, Bokkuko Tsundere Nico, into a Victorious Childhood Friend as part of his personal harem, she will fondly reminisce to him how very touchy-feely he already was with her even when they were still young children (_I remember that even when you were a little kid, you would get me and we would do this and do that_). Koh shamelessly agrees with a straight face (_Yes, I did this and that_).
-   _CLANNAD_: Kyou is talking to Tomoya about giving a love letter from the soccer captain to Ryou: "If she becomes his girlfriend and since you're a guy, you wouldn't be able to do this and that to her."
-   The H-Game of _Da Capo_ has summaries of the individual scenes in the game. For the H scenes, the summary is sometimes pretty straightforward — "We had sex" — but other times it's rather coyer, "We did this and that".
-   Used in _Grandia_ a few times. For example, when a woman, whose sister has been kidnapped by pirates, worries that they might be "making her do this and that".
-   _Little Busters!_, when Riki and Kurugaya are sneaking into the school at night to spend time together, Kurugaya sighs at him for not thinking about how they'd get in without setting off the alarms:
    
    **Kurugaya:** If you want to take a girl into the school late at night and do this and that with her, you should work out your plans better.
    
    **Riki:** Well, I wasn't really going to do this and that with you, but I'll be careful...
    
-   _Fallout 3_:
    -   The game has no issues with saying "Fuck", but there's a character in Megaton whose job is to "comfort" her customers." She doesn't call herself a hooker, call girl, or any other term. She doesn't say that her job is having sex with the bar's customers, but that's exactly what she does.
    -   In Rivet City, if the player tells Father Clifford that Diego and Angela had sex, Angela says:
        
        Someone told Father Clifford that Diego and I were...you know.
        
-   _The Sims_: Sex is referred to only as "Woo Hoo!"
-   Played for Drama in _Yakuza 0_. One sidequest requires you to rescue a girl from a cult that requires constant large donations of money. The girl you are rescuing was unable to gain that money, so the cult's leader demands that she atones for her sins by performing "special Shooreh Pippi" with him (Shooreh Pippi being the cult's term for prayers). Given the details given about this "special Shooreh Pippi" (it's only available to women, and she and the leader "become one"), it's pretty clear what that entails.
-   _Okiku, Star Apprentice_: Used by Okiku and misunderstood by a boy bein in Nishino:
    
    **Boy**: Is it just me, or is mommy's tummy getting bigger?  
    **Okiku**: It sounds like she had some fun.  
    **Boy**: We played together just yesterday, but...  
    **Okiku**: Uhhh, that wasn't exactly what I was talking about!  
    **Okiku**: Oh, never mind, Don't worry about it.
    
-   _Life Is Strange: True Colors_: During the LARP, when Ethan and Alex are trying to get a MacGuffin from Steph, Alex can (in character) offer Steph her hand in marriage "and all of its associated benefits". The euphemism is justified as Ethan is only 10, although he's certainly old enough to recognize that Alex is flirting with Steph for real.
-   _Baldurs Gate 3_:
    -   After Isobel Thorm and Dame Aylin are reunited, Aylin tells the player "Now, leave us. We must take succor in one another's bodies and words." Later interruptions are met with "I must admire Isobel's fulsome beauty away from prying eyes!" and "I have a darling to adore!"

    Real Life 

-   In the 1970s in the UK, a female journalist who had been in a bedroom with a former Ugandan cabinet minister during a dinner party claimed they had been "discussing Uganda". The satirical magazine _Private Eye_ used "discussing Uganda" or "Ugandan relations" like this for years afterward.
-   South Carolina governor Mark Sanford's initial explanation for his disappearance (to visit his mistress in Argentina) was that he had been "hiking the Appalachian Trail", and some commentators explicitly referenced the "discussing Uganda" incident as a comparison, as an inadvertent example of this trope.
