_"Okay, clearly you are the textbook definition of that noise you make when you strum your finger up and down over your lips..."_

While insanity is not always something to laugh at, the kind of madness that leads to someone batting at one's own lips is usually the kind that is Played for Laughs. Characters batting at their own lips is used as a punch-line, requiring a set-up (characters being taken-aback by something irrational or surreal) for them to work off of (motorboating themselves the only kind of reaction they can give, responding to strangeness with more strangeness).

See also Aside Glance or Cuckoo Finger Twirl, other reactions to utter nonsense. Not to be confused with motorboating of an illicit nature.
