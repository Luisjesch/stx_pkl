_Wolf looked up at her, his eyes still bright. "An excellent choice, Pol," he said admiringly. "Blue has always been your best color."  
"Do you like it?" she asked, holding out her arms and turning almost girlishly so that they all might see how fine she looked._

Blue is a surprisingly common color to represent femininity. Thus a girl or woman wearing blue is a sign that she is fair and gentle.

This could have started at least as far back as ancient Greece and Rome, and why The Virgin Mary is often depicted in a blue robe. The logic was that blue symbolizes peace, serenity, kindness, and other such aspects that were considered womanly virtues. (In the Mediterranean, it was also a sign of high rank, as the dye/paint color had to come from indigo, woad, or lapis lazuli which must be imported from a great distance and was therefore quite expensive.) It also represents truth and purity, hence its association with children... and the reason why brides traditionally wore blue dresses (not white) to their weddings (still retained in Old, New, Borrowed and Blue).

From the early to mid 20th century, some argued that blue should be the color for girls, and red should be the color for boys. Yet even though we ended up with Pink Girl, Blue Boy after World War II, putting a woman in blue is still considered a sign of her femininity, if not as obvious as colors like pink and purple.

Blue has other meanings, such as sadness and loneliness. These can overlap with this trope (as in representing both femininity and sadness). Or that she is gentle (with blue representing peace and serenity). This can apply to any feminine woman at any age, some more than others, like a Winter Royal Lady.

Also, blue is an ideal color for all skin tones, as human skin has a base color of orange.

Often overlaps with Water Is Womanly.

-   _Codex Equus_: Many female characters in the setting wear and/or are associated with blue, though how feminine they are depends on the individual.
    -   Blue Diadem, the Expy of Blue Diamond, is heavily associated with blue, and of Silk Dawn's four oldest daughters, she is the most traditionally feminine. This turned out to be an enforced example — due to embodying White Corona's cast-off guilt and sorrow, Blue Diadem was was groomed by Silk Dawn to serve a more feminine role among her sisters. While she became demure and refined, she also became an emotionally toxic Mood-Swinger who stood by while her mother sadistically abused her other sisters.

It's thanks to the emotional support from everyone who genuinely loved her that she's working on overcoming her bigoted upbringing so she could oppose the harmful traditions that once poisoned her.
-   In the _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ fanfic _Walking in Circles_, Evelyn Trevelyan is a noble-born mage whose personality can be summed up as kind, protective, and motherly.

In the Redcliffe future, Fen'Harel dresses her in a blue nightgown before seeking her out in the night, and his murals depict her in blue. Evelyn's personality later changes to a more negative interpretation of this trope, with her being engulfed in sadness and even icy ruthlessness as she becomes Solas's partner in his plan for changing (a.k.a destroying) the current world.

Even before her makeover, she imagines herself wearing a blue sash and hair ribbon with her yellow ballgown during "Once Upon a December," and wears a blue costume as a child at the party in the prologue. Blue and yellow are effectively her two signature colors.
-   Princess Kida of _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_ plays with this. She does indeed wear blue throughout the whole movie, and switches to a darker shade of blue at the end when she is crowned Queen. But then again Kida is a Tomboy Princess and all the other Atlanteans wear blue as well.

The end of the movie sees both of them in a dress of a similar shade, indicating that they've both accepted their differences and similarities.
    -   Cinderella's dress is only blue in products from the "Disney Princess" line. The dress is supposed to be silver (although the glass slippers were always blue-tinted), but Digital Destruction caused her dress to become silvery-blue, a problem that still exists in the blu-ray release<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .

Mostly the blue is because she's An Ice Person.

    -   In _The Little Mermaid_, Ariel wears a blue ribbon in her hair and a dress that is no less than _three_ different shades of blue in the scene where Eric gives her a tour of his kingdom. Her dress at the end when Triton grants her wish and she emerges from the sea is a shimmering silvery-blue number.
    -   The dress Mulan wore to infiltrate the invaded palace, disguised as a courtesan. Chien-Po also wears a blue dress when he, Yao, and Ling disguise themselves as women.
    -   Tiana briefly borrows a fancy blue dress in _The Princess and the Frog_. On a side note, since it took place in The Roaring '20s, that color would have been seen as more feminine than the rest of Charlotte's wardrobe.
    -   _Sleeping Beauty_ played with this by making two of the fairies have a bit of a war over the color of Aurora's dress. It is blue for most of the movie, including the iconic kiss, despite being pink in merchandising.
    -   Snow White's dress has a blue bodice and sleeves, though the skirt is yellow and the sleeves are accented with red.

    -   The Blue Fairy from _Pinocchio_ is dressed in blue.
    -   In _101 Dalmatians_, Anita is usually seen wearing blue. Perdita, like Lady, wears a blue collar.

-   In _Cinderella (2015)_, Ella is color-coded with soft blues to emphasise her nurturing femininity. The beautiful dress she wears for the ball is of course blue as well. This is in stark contrast to the bold and loud colours her stepfamily wear.

-   In _The Court Jester_, Princess Gwendolyn wears a Simple, yet Opulent blue dress and a matching cape trimmed with ermine.
-   _The Dark Knight Rises_: In the ending, Selina Kyle wears a blue dress, as opposed to the black dresses she wore in previous scenes. It is meant to symbolize that she has left the Catwoman identity behind and has started a peaceful new life with Bruce Wayne.

    Literature 

-   The Maiden with Turquoise Hair/Blue Fairy from Carlo Collodi's _The Adventures of Pinocchio_ is never specified in the text itself as wearing blue dresses, but colored illustrations and most adaptations give her that clothing to go along with her blue hair. It also helps that she's meant to be an expy of the Virgin Mary.
-   Alice's dress in _Alice in Wonderland_ is never specified in the text as being blue, but at least one early colorized version of John Tenniel's original black-and-white illustrations made it blue, and blue it became in the popular imagination – probably because this trope makes blue seem especially well-suited to Alice's polite, refined nature. It's often the same color in adaptations too.
-   In the _Aubrey-Maturin_ series, Diana Villiers is most frequently outfitted in shades of blue, symbolizing her sad and frustrating search for a man she can trust.
-   The Farival twins in _The Awakening_ are described as wearing the "Virgin's colors, blue and white, having been dedicated to the Blessed Virgin at their baptism".
-   _The Belgariad_: Polgara the Sorceress, when not wearing gray wool travel garbs, prefers blue reserved for special occasions. Blue is also the color of Aldur, the god who founded the order of sorcerers of which Polgara is a member, but she's been the epitome of style for much of the world for several thousand years, so her fashion sense has definitely rubbed off.
-   _Chalion_: The Daughter's (or Lady of Spring's) color is blue, symbolizing youthful femininity, among other things.
-   In _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_ has the Yule Ball, essentially the Hogwarts version of a High-School Dance. Hermione - who is best known for her bushy hair and no concern with her appearance - stuns everyone by pulling a She Cleans Up Nicely. The image is completed with a dress in periwinkle blue - showing that Hermione does have a girly side to her. But this is only in the book, as the dress is pink in the film.
-   Hilda from _Hilda and Richie_ is also shown wearing a light blue dress complete with a hand fan when not wearing a purple dress; she is shown in the story to be living in a luxurious mansion, displaying her wealthy Proper Lady status.
-   In _Little Women_, Amy is the March sister who most aspires to be a Proper Lady, and her favorite color is blue.
-   _Song at Dawn:_ When a lady wears blue it is consistently referred to as '(Virgin) Mary's color'. When the Arch Bishop sees Emerganda or Alienor wearing it he scoffs at the hypocrisy because (in his mind) they are anything but 'fair and gentle'.
-   _These Broken Stars_: Tarver first sees Lilac wearing a ballgown in navy blue. At this time, unknown to him, she's essentially Alone in a Crowd thanks to her father controlling her life, echoing the sad and lonely side of the trope. She's wearing the same colour, a dressing gown this time, in the final scene. This time she's fresh from standing up to her father and is free to openly be with the man she loves.
-   Dorothy Gale from _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ (and in the film adaptation) wears a blue and white gingham dress. This becomes a plot point in the book: as blue is the Munchkin color and white is only worn by witches, the Munchkins initially mistake her for a witch, but a good one who intends to be friends with the Munchkins, when her house comes out of nowhere and flattens the Wicked Witch of the East. She's an empathetic character who convinces all three of her True Companions to pursue their dreams and goals, and is also a Friend to All Living Things – in short, a ladylike spirit, even if she is a farm girl.

-   In _Doctor Who_, Clara Oswald, a companion who is introverted and lonely, but usually very compassionate and kind, is fond of wearing articles of clothing in various shades of blue. Given its sheer frequency throughout her entire run, it's probably her subconscious favourite colour. Outside of the original Clara, this habit even extends to some of her time paradox spawned doubles in different eras, especially the Victorian governess one. Possibly a symbol of loss too, as she lost her mother in her teens, which affected her rather profoundly. She's also occasionally seen in a predominant red or green from time to time, reflecting other sides of her personality. When she wears blue, she's mostly quiet and thoughtful, green-clad Clara is an adventurer, pragmatist and tends to be crankier, and wearing red clothing often coincides with her showing a 'cheery romantic dreamer' streak.
    -   Rose Tyler wears a blue jacket at the beginning of the "New Earth" story until she later gets possessed by Lady Cassandra, who later strips it off in order to expose Rose's purple blouse underneath. These are considered to be Rose's most Iconic Outfits by many fans. The blue represents Rose's caring, humble and gentle personality in contrast to Cassandra's darker, haughty and sultry character.
-   In _Downton Abbey_, Lady Sybil Crawley (later Branson) has many blue outfits, possibly to represent her role as the youngest and most innocent of the family and ultimately Too Good for This Sinful Earth.
-   _Game of Thrones_:

    -   Trish's wardrobe in _The Defenders_ is primarily made of blues.
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_:
    -   Bronwyn wears a dress that's a brilliant royal blue. She is very lady like and nurturing.
    -   Galadriel wears a light blue dress in Numenor.
-   In _Mad Men_ this is the beauty-focused and traditional Betty Draper Francis's favored color along with white, given how it highlights her Grace Kelly-esque beauty, Teutonic coloring (light skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes). Not only does it serve a purpose in highlighting her looks, it also highlights her role as housewife and mother.

-   Constance and Queen Anne from _The Musketeers_ occasionally wear blue.
-   In _Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation_, resident Sixth Ranger and sole girl of the team Venus de Milo wore a cyan (a shade of blue) mask. Which was a bit odd since the team already _had_ a blue turtle, Leonardo, but the shades are different enough that it isn't too confusing.
-   On an episode of _QI_ discussing male/female dynamics and oddities Stephen brought up that the Pink Girl, Blue Boy trope used to be reversed, as well as specific reasons why. The panelists seem quite stunned at just the sheer oddity of the reversal to the trope.
    
    **Stephen:** For a long while, the colors would be pink for a baby boy, and blue for a baby girl.  
    **Jack Dee:** How did they get it wrong for so long?

-   Although most _Super Sentai_/_Power Rangers_ Blue Rangers are male, the few times they are female, this comes into play. True to trope rules, when the female Ranger is blue it's of a considerably lighter and softer shade than her male counterparts (with the notable exceptions of the very first female blue ranger, _Choujuu Sentai Liveman_'s Blue Dolphin, who was more or less the same color as the previous blue rangers and the blue ranger from _Ninja Sentai Kakuranger_/_Alien Rangers_ who wears a light cyan costume despite being male). Both canon female Blue Rangers, Tori and Madison, are very feminine characters. In Tori's case, she's The Heart and Madison is the Girly Girl contrasted with her Tomboy sister Vida (who ironically is the Pink Ranger).
-   In _Westworld_, Dolores, the standard "girl-next-door" in Sweetwater, wears a blue dress.

    Music 

-   Crowded House also has a song called "Into Temptation" in which a girl in a blue dress appears at his door.

    I couldn't believe my luck  
    You in your new blue dress  
    Taking away my breath_
    
-   Depeche Mode has a song called "Blue Dress" about a seductress in blue.
    
    _Put it on  
    And don't say a word  
    Put it on  
    The one that I prefer_
    
-   Devin Millar has an animated girl character named Millicent. She wears a bright blue puffy-sleeved shirt and a dark blue skirt.
-   Vocaloid: Hatsune Miku is the most well-known blue-color-scheme character (and the most well-known overall). Of the female Crypton characters, her official personality is the most traditionally feminine, in contrast to Rin (yellow), or the "cool" and mature Luka (pink) and Meiko (red). She is often used for songs that do not fit the "gentle feminine girl" theme, but in these cases, any art associated with the song usually changes her coloring to something darker or redder.

    Music Videos 

-   Mystery Skulls features Vivi in the animated music video for "Ghost". She is blue all over, and even her skin tone is a cool shade.
-   Tears for Fears: In the "Mad World" music video, the young girl staring sadly at a candle is garbed in a blue dress.

    Myths & Religion 

-   As mentioned above, The Virgin Mary is often depicted dressed in blue. Another explanation for this convention is that medieval artists wanted to dress the Mother of God in the richest clothing they could think of, and ultramarine (which is made of ground-up lapis lazuli) was the most expensive dye. St. Peter is also usually shown dressed in blue, but usually a lighter shade (i.e. with little or no ultramarine in it) or in blue and orange-y yellow.

    Pinballs 

-   Damsel in Distress Miss Polly of _Cactus Canyon_ wears a modest blue dress.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Alexa Bliss in her Face incarnation was a cute 'Fairy Princess' who loved sparkles - making her one of the most feminine of the NXT women. Almost all of her outfits were blue, as were the graphics in her titantron. She also had blue tips in her hair. Notably when she underwent a Face–Heel Turn, her costumes and hair became red.
-   The Beauty Pair of Zenjo, the first breakout stars of joshi puroreso or the Japanese women's pro wrestling circuit, usually dressed in blue, when they weren't wearing black anyway, or blue with black stripes or black with blue stripes. Anyway, they were a fairly "feminine" pair by pro wrestling standards, almost as well known for their singing, dancing, and fashion as they were for their take downs and pins. As a result, wrestlers have since worn blue(or black) when expressing their femininity.
-   Bayley's first recognisable outfit was a light shade of baby blue, to reflect her innocence as The Ingenue. While she eventually wore more colours, she frequently has plenty of blue on her gear as well.
-   When WSU became an all women's company, purple and blue became its primary colors, on the logo and the title belt plates, respectively. In this case, they symbolized bruising more than grace or peace. When CZW took over the promotion was increasingly signified by pink, however.

    Puppet Shows 

-   In the Neighborhood of Make Believe of _Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,_ Henrietta Pussycat, the fashionable yet caring cat, sometimes wore a blue dress.

    Theatre

-   Dinah the Dining Car from Andrew Lloyd Webber’s _Starlight Express_ dons a blue dress, often with matching accessories.
-   Edward Albee's _Tiny Alice_ has the Original Cast Precedent of Alice wearing blue. As theatre critic Otis L. Guernsey pointed out, though many people took this as symbolic, "nowhere does the _Tiny Alice_ script specify that Miss Alice wear blue, though it does describe her boudoir as 'Feminine, but not frilly. Blues instead of pinks.'"
-   The iconic glittering "good witch" gown that Glinda ultimately wears in _Wicked_ (at least in the original production and its replicas) is pale blue – a change both from _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_, where it's white, and the classic film, where it's pink.

    Toys 

-   In _BIONICLE_, all the Matoran/Toa/Turaga of the Water element are female and blue colored. The female elements of Lightning and Psionics also have blue as their main color. This is solely averted with Orde, created by the Great Beings as the first Toa of Psionics. His first task was to soothe the savage Zyglak, but due to his temper, he only worsened matters. As a result, all subsequent Matoran and Toa of Psionics were made female because Women Are Wiser.
-   In _Rainbow High_, first wave character Skyler Bradshaw's signature color is blue, and she is also an aspiring fashion designer.

    Video Games 

-   Disciples of the exclusively-female Holy Water Palace in _Age Of Wushu_ wear all-blue uniforms that pair nicely with their yin-based, water-themed, softness-damage martial arts.
-   In _Bioshock Infinite_, Elizabeth at first wears a blue skirt with a white shirt that has blue details. She then changes into a long blue skirt and blue shrug (which are a replica of clothes Lady Comstock wore who also is an example of this trope). Here the blue symbolizes sadness, peace, and isolation.
-   _Body Blows_: Azona is a blue-clad warrior woman who competes in the series' second tournament, _Body Blows Galactic_, which pits fighters from various planets against each other to determine the greatest fighter in the universe. Worth noting that her choice of color for her attire is fitting within the context of this trope given that her, and Kai-Ti's, home planet, Feminon, has a matriarchal society.
-   _Dead or Alive_ has Kasumi and Helena. The former's trademark outfit is a blue ninja tunic while the latter's outfits include a blue dress, a blue tailcoat, and a black-and-blue catsuit.
-   _Dragon Age: Inquisition_:
    -   Josephine fits this trope, wearing a regal ensemble of blue and gold. She is a sweet Proper Lady and skilled diplomat who gets along with just about everyone.
    -   Empress Celene of Orlais is also only seen wearing a deep blue ballgown with gold accents. She is certainly regarded as a paragon of fashion, diplomacy, and elegance; however, unlike Josephine, she's not a particularly nice person.
-   Rinoa in _Final Fantasy VIII_ wears a blue coat, and is perhaps the most feminine of the female player characters (aside from Selphie, who is more perky).
-   In _Disney's Guilty Party_, the matron Olivia Dickens wears a long blue evening dress as an ensemble with her white fur coat.
-   _Harvest Moon_:
    -   Elli from _Harvest Moon 64_ is the granddaughter of Ellen from the first game. She is a gentle baker who wears a blue dress and apron. In all subsequent appearances, besides _Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility_, she is based on her _Harvest Moon: Back to Nature_ appearance, who is now a nurse but keeps the same attire.
    -   Muffy from _Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life_ switches from her red dress to a more conservative, light blue dress when you marry her in the Playstation 2 version (_Special Edition_). She's the most stereotypically feminine of the bachelorettes, not really liking getting her hands dirty and wearing make-up.
-   Aqua from _Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep_. She has blue hair, matching blue eyes, wears blue in her outfit, and is graceful in battle and a motherly figure to the lost boys and Ventus.
-   While the many incarnations of _The Legend of Zelda's_ titular Zelda have run a gamut of colors over the series, her _A Link to the Past_ incarnation dons a casual blue dress (though her princess attire is pink), and both her regal and traveling outfits in _Breath of the Wild_ are predominantly blue (with the similarly blue Non Uniform Uniforms that Link and the other Champions wear stated in "The Champions' Ballad" to have been sewn by her). Furthermore, she is also the bearer of the Triforce of Wisdom in a lot of entries in the series, which is usually associated with blue.
-   Amitie Florian of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's Portable: The Gears of Destiny_ generally wears blue clothes that reflect her kind and friendly demeanor. It also matches well with her sister's very pink motif.
-   Sona from _League of Legends_ is a blue-haired, sweet and calm mute songstress whose beautiful blue dress covers her esbelt body. Her skillset revolves around helping allies by damaging, debuffing and stunning enemies while also healing, shielding and buffing allies, thanks to her etwahl.
-   In _Mega Man Star Force_, Luna almost always wears a blue uniform while remaining into stereotypically girly things like plushies.
-   Kitana from _Mortal Kombat II_ (and all subsequent appearances) wears blue, has from her very first appearance. The only times she hasn't has been in the film, where she wears a dark bluish/black outfit, and her Dark Empress skin from _Mortal Kombat X_, which is also a blackish-navy blue color.
-   The Velvet Room attendants from the _Persona_ series. They all dress in blue to match the room they reside in and as they are typically the opposite sex of the current protagonist, all but one are female.
-   Brionne and Primarina, Popplio's evolutions in _Pokémon Sun and Moon_ are very feminine and very blue Pokemon based on sirens/mermaids.
-   Rulue from _Puyo Puyo_ sports a head of flowing blue hair, and her outfit typically has blue accents on it. She serves as the girly-girl rival to tomboyish Arle and is identified by having a mad crush on Satan, despite him being more interested in Arle.
-   Yurika Kirishima of _Rival Schools_' _Project Justice_ wears a bright blue dress, and is very clearly the most feminine character in her series.
-   In _Shining in the Darkness_, the bodice of Princess Jessa's dress is blue.
-   Posthumous Character Maria Robotnik from _Sonic The Hedgehog_ wore a blue dress, blue shoes, and a blue headband. She was a sweet, Friend to All Living Things ill girl who had a sibling-esque relationship with Shadow. It's possible that her blue attire is supposed to date her, as she died 50 years ago, though what this means in the series is unknown (her flashbacks are very technologically advanced compared to the real 1950s so it's unknown if the _Sonic_ series takes place 20 Minutes into the Future or if their world is just advanced).
-   _Street Fighter_:
    -   Chun-Li wears blue outfits as her main clothing in the games, particularly a blue Qipao.
    -   R. Mika wears a bright teal blue wrestling outfit that shows a lot of skin especially her breasts and buttocks.

    Web Comics 

-   In _Alice and the Nightmare_, kind and quiet Edith wears blue and has blue as her Suit's colour.

-   Played with in _El Goonish Shive_. Susan has black-blue hair and usually is seen in blue clothing when strips are colored. She's definitely _feminine_, and the head of her school's feminist club, but demure doesn't factor in - _withdrawn_, due to her various traumas, feels like the word to use. Or raging with a magic hammer in her hand.

-   The main character from _Invincea And The Warriors From Hell_ has strong blue theming.

-   _Sleepless Domain_: Undine is a Magical Girl with blue hair and overall theming who is quite feminine, as evidenced by her ladylike fashion sense, demure personality, and control over water. This forms a contrast with her partner Heartful Punch in both color and personality — in spite of her pink theming and heart-themed powers, HP is an athletic, tomboyish brawler to the core.

    Web Original 

-   _Looming Gaia_: Out of the three female Freelance Good Guys, the only one who doesn't have blue in her design most of the time is the masculine warrior Elska. Linde is The Fashionista and often wears blue to go with her ice magic, and Alaine has blue hair due to being a mermaid and often wears blue as well.

    Western Animation 

-   _Blinky Bill_: The clothes in Daisy Dingo's standard outfit (a knotted top, jeans, and high heels) are all coloured in different shades of blue (although they eventually gained a teal tint due to season 3's slight Art Evolution).

-   Sparkles in _The Grossery Gang_ webseries is a light blue soda can, while also being the only girl of the team. While she's a bit more rough-and-tumble and sarcastic than most girls, she has the most tact and sympathy for others out of the gang as well, acting like a big sister to Egghead, while also being the grounding force to Pizza Face's riskier ventures.
-   Sarah Phillips from _Liberty's Kids_.
-   Emily on _Little Bear_ generally wears a blue dress.
-   Charlotte of _Making Fiends_ is _completely_ blue. Her skin, eyes, clothes, and hair are all blue. She's the epitome of a Cheerful Child.
-   _MeteoHeroes_: Patty Storm/Pluvia wears a blue jumpsuit as her superhero costume and Su Pa Sin/Nix has a cyan color scheme.
-   _Molly of Denali_: Trini's outfits have a lot of blue in them, and she is the most traditionally "feminine" of the kids, as she usually wears a dress.
-   XJ-9 from _My Life as a Teenage Robot_ is a teenage robot girl who has blue hair and has blue-colored body parts to resemble teenage fashion. Many sub-plots focus on her struggles as a high school student who wants to fit in with her flesh-and-blood classmates.
-   _My Little Pony_: Action Girl Megan from the original generation, who wore blue overalls in the show.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   Rainbow Dash is an aversion because she's the least feminine of the main characters.
    -   Princess Ember, a female dragon from the season six episode "Gauntlet of Fire", is one of few female dragons on the show and bright cobalt blue.
-   Bubbles of _The Powerpuff Girls_, the girliest of them, is color-coded with a blue dress.
-   Downplayed with some characters from _Ready Jet Go!_. Celery, Dr. Skelley, and Dr. Rafferty all wear blue, but they're not stereotypically feminine. Out of all of them, Dr. Rafferty would likely be the most feminine.
-   _Rosie's Rules_: The artsy Crystal wears a blue denim jacket. Her mother, Liz, also wears blue. In fact, almost all of the girls and women wear blue, even Jun.
-   While in the comics she wears a variety of clothes, the sweet and feminine Sabrina in _Sabrina and The Groovie Goolies_ mainly wears a blue dress.
-   Princess Sally Acorn of _Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)_ media wears blue boots and vest. She's feminine, but strong, even giving (G-rated) cusses to Robotnik.
-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_ plays with this trope regarding the title character Star Butterfly, The Underestimated. She often wears dresses in various shades of blue, but despite her appearance, her actions are not that feminine. Played straight with her mother Moon Butterfly, The Undaunted, whose default outfit is a very feminine blue dress. She also has blue hair. However, there are times when she can fight, but she's usually more graceful than Star.
-   _Steven Universe_:
    -   Lapis Lazuli combines this with Amazing Technicolor Population — not only is she featured wearing a skirt and top in shades of blue, but her hair, eyes, and even skin are shades of blue as well. Along with Rose Quartz and Sapphire she's the only Gem thus far whose primary outfit features a long skirt.
    -   Sapphire is the Girly Girl to Ruby's Tomboy — unlike the (literally) Hot-Blooded Ruby, Sapphire is soft-spoken, demure, and patient, and has more feminine powers like precognition, Super-Speed, and ice magic. And like Lapis, she also combines it with blue skin and hair (though Sapphire does have patches of white in her outfit). However, when around Ruby, she becomes more open, affectionate, and talkative to sickening to degrees. Various episodes reveal that Sapphire Gems, as part of Blue Diamond's court, were expected to act demure and reserved like their matriarch, our Sapphire included. That is, until one of her Ruby bodyguards unexpectedly fused with her trying to protect her, proving that the future is not as infallible as she once thought. The rest was history.
    -   Steven's friend, Connie Maheswaran, wears a light turquoise-green dress in some episodes as well as in the first title sequence. This initially connects with her shy, lonely, and studious demeanor, as her parents were overbearing and strict, but it's ultimately downplayed as she gradually comes out of her shell thanks to her friendship with Steven. While she still enjoys feminine interests, her overall personality is more masculine compared to Steven, with her outfits changing to reflect this.
    -   Blue Diamond is the most traditionally feminine member of the Diamond Authority, being a demure, melancholic, and soft-spoken Gem who wears figure-hugging gowns and cloaks to emphasize her curvy features. And of the four Diamonds, she's the only one associated with water, as she has reverse empathy that emits a blue aura when used, bluish-white energy manipulation, and a blue psychic aura that flows like water. She also oversees a court that's entirely composed of blue-colored Gems; according to Rebecca Sugar, blue Gems are "mainly diplomats".
    -   Blue Pearl, who is Blue Diamond's servant and closest associate, fits the stereotype of Pearls as emotionless, pretty dolls for nobles, wearing a dainty, ballerina-like dress while her hair completely covers her eyes. She also speaks softly like her mistress does.
-   _Thundarr the Barbarian_: Ariel wears a blue Leotard of Power, and she's not only the sole female of the heroic trio, but also the only one who can use magic (Thundarr uses a magic sword while Ookla relies on brute strength), which fits her background as the daughter of the evil wizard Sabain. She's also wily, intelligent, and resourceful; while she does end up in situations where she needs to be rescued by her companions, she had proved herself to be a genuine Action Girl enough times that she avoids the Faux Action Girl label. Unfortunately, her tendency to give history lectures falls on deaf ears and also annoys Thundarr.

-   Downplayed with True from _True and the Rainbow Kingdom_. She has blue hair, and is pretty girly; But blue is probably her natural hair color.
-   _Winx Club_:
    -   Many of Bloom's fairy forms are primarily blue. Also her civilian outfit (her first outfit is a teal crop top with dark blue trim and pale yellow sleeves with blue slightly flared jeans that have stars on the bottom of the legs) with the exception of her pink top in season 4.
    -   On the villain side, the witch Icy is the Dark Feminine type.
