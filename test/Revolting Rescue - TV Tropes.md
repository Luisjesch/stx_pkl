**Mario:** I'm gonna save Santa with my plumber-snake!  
**Santa Claus:** _\[voiced by Phelous\]_ Uhhh, no, that's okay, Mario. I'd rather you didn't save me with the— _\[splat\]_ Uggghh, that wasn't worth it.

Quick! Someone's in danger! Or possibly multiple people, or even the world! Fortunately, someone's come to the rescue. _Un_fortunately, however, it's rather icky, and that's what the Revolting Rescue is.

Maybe it involves a Fantastic Medicinal Bodily Product that's something rather unpleasant such as snot or pee. Maybe a giant needs to use an off-putting bodily fluid to save a human somehow. Maybe someone needs to set their Farts on Fire, throw up, or use animal droppings for something, but regardless of the specifics, it's not pretty. If the person doing the rescue is The Pig-Pen, they'll usually enjoy it, but otherwise, they'd only do it grudgingly.

Usually Played for Laughs, and as such, often involves Toilet Humour. It could also involve Fartillery, a Vomit Indiscretion Shot, Complaining About Rescues They Don't Like (perhaps from an Ungrateful Bastard, a Neat Freak, or a germophobe), Solid Gold Poop, a Heroic Sacrifice, Vulgar Humour, the Godzilla Threshold, Heart Is an Awesome Power, or Urine Trouble. All-Natural Fire Extinguisher is a sub-trope. Compare Shoot the Dog and Cruel to Be Kind.
