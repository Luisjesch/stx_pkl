_"Not her! Not her! She pees standing up!"_

Sexual attraction is a funny thing, and sometimes if a character _physically appears_ to be the right gender to appeal to their sexual orientation, then they'll become attracted to them, regardless of what that character's _actual_ gender might be. Usually, said character's true gender is being kept secret purposefully, and they are a male Disguised in Drag or a female disguised as a male (sometimes even using a realistic mask or a Full-Body Disguise), but, whether the misunderstanding was intentional or not, due to Rule of Drama, they _will_ find out, and it _will_ be awkward, hilarious and possibly traumatizing for all involved.

This works equally well with straight people as it does gay ones.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  A straight female might be shocked to realize that hot guy she's been daydreaming about was "actually" a woman. Her male Gay Best Friend, who was also daydreaming about the same guy (who is "really" a girl) will probably feel similarly. Almost always there is shock upon The Reveal, probably disappointment and maybe even disgust on the part of the character who was feeling the attraction, but usually the two characters can reconcile by the end and become friends. Other times it might not bother them, or after a period of consideration, they'll decide If It's You, It's Okay.

This is both a reveal trope as well as a character reaction trope, when what initially appears to be compatible gender attraction is later revealed to actually be _incompatible_ gender attraction (_Example: Straight boy likes a girl, girl turns out to be a boy_). It is a sister trope to the related Sweet on Polly Oliver, which refers to when what initially appears to be inexplicable _incompatible_ gender attraction is later revealed to actually be _compatible_ gender attraction (_Example: Straight boy likes a boy, boy turns out to be a girl_), although since the unsettling part is averted, this is usually a subversion (usually).

It's also worth noting that, in many examples of this trope, it's not the _gender_ (i.e., gender identity) that's a shocker, but the _genitals_ (granted, examples portraying crossdressers vastly outnumber any portraying those who are transgender). One common example is that a straight man is attracted to a woman, but finds out that she's transgender and has a penis. In Real Life, "trans panic" can have violent or even lethal consequences, as numerous trans people—especially trans women, and _especially_ especially trans women from marginalized ethnicities (for example, Black people in The United States)—have been physically or sexually assaulted, sometimes even murdered, when their genitals are revealed. With the growing LGBT Civil Rights movement catching on in the Turn of the Millennium and The New '10s, this is starting to lean more towards a Discredited Trope, though it still occasionally pops up.

Compare with Shapeshifting Squick, Dude Looks Like a Lady, Lady Looks Like a Dude, Bifauxnen, Gender-Blender Name, Samus Is a Girl, Female Monster Surprise, Incompatible Orientation, and Trans Relationship Troubles. Often accompanied by Attractive Bent-Gender. Contrast Jumping the Gender Barrier, Supernaturally-Validated Trans Person, and She's a Man in Japan. A subtrope of Gender Reveal.

Formerly called "Dropped A Bridget On Him", a play on the _Guilty Gear_ character (shown above) and the Dropped a Bridge on Him trope; references back to this title are still scattered around the site.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Happens once in _+Anima_, when a boy named Kevin falls in love with Husky, thinking he's a beautiful Mermaid Princess. Eventually, Husky tries to break the news him that he's really the 'Mermaid Princess' without overwhelming him, but ends up screaming it at Kevin before becoming human again. Kevin, is, to say the least, rather shocked that his Mermaid is Husky.
-   _Adekan_: Anri and Shiro, both being effeminate Pretty Boys, have gotten people to think they're women. In one scene, Shiro is walking in a public bath house and the men around him ogle him thinking he's a woman. When they get a look at his chest they're confused and horrified.
-   In chapter 279 of _Air Gear_ while fighting Agito, Shalott reveals to Agito that he is actually a guy (and a VERY well endowed one) before knocking him down, sitting atop him and saying after he beats him up he can "have a lick" if he wants.
-   _Ai no Shintairiku_:
    -   This happens to Naruse when he accidentally feels up Sara on the train. He falls for her by the end of the series and doesn't care that she's transgender.
    -   This occurs to Sara's entire class when Sara is Forced Out of the Closet by her teacher.
-   In _Akahori Gedou Hour Lovege_ episode 9, the son of a businessman that Kaoruko is babysitting (the kid, not the businessman) ends up being a girl, much to Kaoruko's dismay.
-   _And You Thought There Is Never a Girl Online?_ plays with this quite a lot:
    -   Two years prior to the start of the series, protagonist Hideki proposed to a female MMORPG player who then revealed herself to be a man in real life, causing him to believe that There Are No Girls on the Internet. Partway into the series, it's revealed that the player actually _was_ a woman in real life, and was merely invoking this trope to avoid unwanted male attention, so the show manages to pull this off twice with the _same character_. Admittedly, part of the reason Hideki was unsettled by the second reveal was because the woman in question turned out to be his _high-school teacher_.
    -   The best interesting part is during the offline meet where Hideki meets Ako in real life for the first time. When you look at the entire Alley Cats Guild online, you may assume that Ako's is the only female player. But the truth comes out when during the guild's first offline meet, it turns out that Hideki's the only male player in the guild. Turns out that his other two "male" guild-mates, Schwein and Apricot is actually his classmate Akane Segawa and the Student Council President Kyou Goshouin. Guess this anime really fits the title.
-   In _Aphorism_, this is how Hinata and Mino met for the first time. Hinata even had a crush on him for a while: his reaction at the Bridget-dropping was throughly expected.
-   Tenma in _As the Gods Will_ is revealed to be a boy when Akashi solves a puzzle by finding a mannequin that most closely resembles Tenma; all the other mannequins were women, while the solution was the male mannequin.
-   She gets over it quickly, but Mira of _Asteroid in Love_ is initially shocked to learn that the "boy" she'd been daydreaming about for years is actually the girl sitting next to her in the club she just joined.
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_:
    -   Played with; when Suzu's family see Matsuri for the first time in years, they're shocked the kid they assumed was a boy grew into a pretty girl (Suzu's little brother paying special attention to Matsuri's breasts). The truth is, Matsuri _was_ a boy back then and still identifies as one now, but he'd recently been turned female and adopted a female identity.
    -   Double Subverted when Rochka see Matsuri's crotch the instant his transformation is partially reversed. Since Rochka is a naive ayakashi that only looks human, she's _very_ confused, but continues thinking Matsuri is a girl. Eventually, she does realize he's a guy, and holds something of a grudge over the incident.
        
        **Rochka**: I don't have anything like **that**! \[...\] I can freeze that off for you!  
        **Matsuri**: No, don't!
        
-   _Black Butler_: While undercover in a circus, Ciel shares a tent with a skinny teen that he calls "Freckles". Turns out that he is really a girl named Doll. She offers to show him her privates so he can be sure.
-   In an omake in _Black Lagoon_ where everybody is Gender Flipped, Rock runs into Revy and is at first relieved that she's still the same, until she unashamedly pulls down her shorts and shows him/her... a little extra something underneath.
-   In _Bleach_, Yoruichi debuts in the form of a cat with a male voice actor. Actually, she is a female, who surprises the hell out of Ichigo, especially when she's reveals this while naked. (Making this funnier, Kisuke Urahara's first line spoken to her cat form in the English dub was "Who's my favorite pussy?")
-   This is a primary plot point in _Blue Drop: Tenshitachi no Bokura_. The main character must have sex on penalty of death with his best friend, who has been transformed into a girl by the evil lesbian aliens and impregnate him. Happens in the reverse, too; the friend in question is uncomfortable with having sex with the main character as well. Then it's found out that the best friend's mind was simply put over the top of a random alien girl's mind. When they fully merge at the end of the manga, it's unknown if he is a she with a guy's mind, or a guy still trapped in a girl body. It's rather messed up regardless.
-   Despite being an Otokonoko Genre deconstruction featuring several crossdressers, this doesn't really occur much in _Bokura no Hentai_:
    -   One day at school, trans girl Marika (who was still living as a boy) is grabbed by a female student and gets asked if she's "a drag queen". Marika is uncomfortable by the question until the 'girl' reveals himself to be a boy named Satoshi. He crossdresses constantly and even several classmates don't realize his gender. He stops crossdressing by his second year because he hit a growth spurt and couldn't fit into his sisters hand-me-down anymore.
    -   Marika invokes this when at a School Festival. She was having worries about her gender and entered a crossdressing competition by saying she was a crossdressing boy. She won it.
-   Kimino from _Boku to Boku_ is asked out on a date by a shy looking girl named Asou. She doesn't like girls but goes anyway. At the end of the date Asou is revealed to be a boy when Kimino accidentally sees him peeing in the bushes, though the other Wholesome Crossdresser Yuuki says he already guessed it. Asou transfers to Kimino's school but is an Abhorrent Admirer because Kimino likes her other friend, Josei, and because Asou is a Covert Pervert.
-   PG version in _Cardcaptor Sakura_. When Sakura, Kero and Tomoyo have to catch a Clow Card that has taken residence in a painting, they meet with a kid named Yuuki whose Disappeared Dad is the artist who painted it. At the end of the episode Yuuki's hat falls off and reveals _very_ long hair, thus showing the trio (and us) that Yuuki is a tomboyish girl.
-   _Case Closed_:
    -   The entire population of Tsukugeshima in "Moonlight Sonata" case was not only surprised that the island's only doctor Narumi Asai is the Villain of the Week, but also that "she" is a man.
    -   Much later, Conan, Hakuba and Heiji realize that the "Detective of the South", Natsuki Koshimizu, is a Bifauxnen instead of a waifish boy. They only find out when she puts on her school uniform... a feminine _seifuku_ instead of a male _gakuran_ like the one Heiji has just put on. (OTOH the "Detective of the North", Junya Tokitsu, already knew and didn't tell them; in fact, he was _surprised_ to learn that they didn't know about Natsuki's gender.)
    -   And the reverse-drop happens _again_ when Action Girl Sera Masumi appears. Conan, Ran and Sonoko don't find out that the handsome and devil-may-care boy that said Ran was "his type" and helped them resolve a case, was actually a Bifauxnen... until she appears in a female highschool uniform and transfers to the girls's class.
    -   In manga chapter 830, it comes up _again_. Sera is such a Bifauxnen that even Kaitou Kid mistakes her as a boy. _After having knocked her out and stripped her down to her boyish underwear and shirt to steal her clothes_. Said person doesn't find out until Conan explains it to him, and when that happens a VERY upset Sera returns and kicks him to the face.
-   _Claudine_: When he first sees Claude, Louis mistakes him for a cisboy. It isn't until Rosemarie mentions Claude's relation to Auguste de Montesse- who everyone knows has one "daughter"- that Louis realizes Claude was born female.
-   _Code Geass_: In the Turn 9.34 Picture Drama C.C., Kallen, and Lelouch dress up as belly dancers to sneak into the Chinese Federation. C.C. and Kallen introduce Lelouch as their "beautiful older sister" and the men ogle him. Of course, Lelouch has a masculine voice, so when he speaks, they realize that he's a guy. However, this is unsettling to us... but the person they're there to assassinate is fine with Lelouch being a boy. As long as it's pretty...
-   _Cowboy Bebop_:
    -   Nobody finds out that Ed's a girl until Faye tickles her! Everyone else can be forgiven since she's a pre-pubescent Tomboy with No Social Skills, and it's also a Development Gag to when Ed really was a boy in the original version of the story before being changed to a girl for cast balance.
    -   A downplayed version in "Jupiter Jazz (Part 1)" — Gren is a male with female breasts due to being used for drug testing.
-   In _Date A Live_ Shido poses as a girl to get close to the man-hating Miku. When she discovers he's a boy she has an Oh, Crap! moment and tricks several _thousand_ mind-controlled people to hunt him down.
-   Subverted in _The Day of Revolution_: Former boy Megumi actually wants to drop a Bridget on the only boy at school who doesn't know her "secret" but the other girls forbid it for reasons of their own. (And when she finally did decide to tell him he wasn't listening.)
-   _DEVILMAN crybaby_: Ryo/Satan reveals a fully male and female body when he adopts his beautiful, angelic true form. Since angels are both sexes and since this is Netflix we get to see the dick and everything. Of course, the characters (and possibly viewer) have too much on their mind at this point to really say anything so it goes unremarked on for the whole show.
-   In _Digimon Fusion_ episode 28, it's revealed that Cutemon, the two-foot-tall, pink, scarf-wearing Healer of Team Xros Heart, is a boy. Boys dont cry!
-   _.hack_: Given that the entire series is based on a fictional MMORPG, there are plenty of GIRLs around.
    -   In _.hack//SIGN_, Tsukasa is the Bridget that gets dropped on _herself_. Among the initial worries that come with a revelation like this is that her gender will affect her relationship with Subaru. Turns out, it didn't matter.
    -   It also happened in _.hack//Roots_ when two female players attacked Haseo and their voices change.
-   In _Dragon Ball_, Krillin tries to hit on Upa, then gets embarrassed when Goku tells him Upa is a boy.
-   In the _D.N.Angel_ manga Satoshi once went Disguised in Drag and Dark nearly kisses him before realizing he's a guy.
-   _Family Compo_: Misahako moves into his aunt and uncle's place and finds out they're both transgender via accidentally seeing their privates.
-   A rather bizarre example occurs in _Fist of the North Star_. Rei is introduced wearing a pink cloak and is mistaken for a woman, as only his eyes are visible. It's not until he speaks, and fully pulls the cloak off that his manly bod is revealed. It's worse in the anime, where Rei is pursued by _several men_ trying to get a date.
-   Played for laughs in _Fate/Apocrypha_. Throughout the series, Jeanne has shown signs of jealousy towards Astolfo over Sieg's attention, not knowing that Astolfo is a guy. Then, in episode 19 of the anime, Astolfo ends up walking out of the shower naked right in front of her, leading to her finally figuring it out, and letting out one hell of a scream. Astolfo is left laughing about even on the following day. Even funnier is that Jeanne has the True Name Discernment ability, which lets her figure out any Servant's identity, meaning there's no reason she SHOULDN'T have known Astolfo was a guy from the start. To quote Sieg on the matter:
    
    **Sieg:** I didn't expect her of all people not to know.
    
-   In _Fire Candy_, pretty much all of the gang members who see Prostitute Haru for the first time assume that he is a cute, young, flat-chested girl and only later (often already past the point when it would be just disturbing) are informed of the error in that assumption.
-   _Flame of Recca_:
    -   Happens twice in the same minute in the anime. A dim bunch of henchmen have been told to apprehend a high-school-age boy, and they identify Fuko (a very tomboyish, macho girl) as their target. Immediately afterward, the rather feminine Tokiya screams at them, "You idiots! I bet you thought I was a girl!"
    -   Subverted in the manga. Recca asks Aoi three questions, the third being "Are you a guy or a girl?". Aoi answers that he's a guy, but instead of being stupefied about the gender, Recca merely brushes it off to mean that he can fight as he pleases.
-   _Fruits Basket_:
    -   Most of the Zodiac, plus Tohru, get a huge shock in the manga upon learning that Akito, the head of the Sohma family is actually a girl but was Raised as the Opposite Gender.
    -   Tohru is also shocked to find out that Ritsu is actually a boy. She never would have known except for the fact that he transformed into a monkey when they embraced.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_: Happens to Greed in one OVA in which he flirts with "Winry", who is actually the shapeshifter Envy, who is male in this version.
-   In _Gankutsuou_, this happens to Albert as early as Episode 2. The "woman" then proceeds to tease him about it for the rest of the series. And later appears to go on to a successful modeling career... This is an expansion of a minor character from _The Count of Monte Cristo,_ who lured Albert into Vampa's trap.
-   In the Arina Tanemura manga _The Gentlemen's Alliance_, the character Maora was so feminine in the first volume that even the staff who read it thought that he was a girl. His real gender wasn't revealed until the second volume.
-   Invoked Trope in _Genzo_: Princess Kiku has sworn to marry the man capable of defeating her in combat, and is skilled enough to beat all suitors, but just when her head retainer brings a huge numbers of suitors to challenge her, she sneezes so hard she breaks her ribs and begs for help from Genzo. The puppetmaster, however, warns her that while he can make a perfect puppet of her, he doesn't know anything of swordfighting and thus is unable to stage a duel, so he decides to use another way: namely, halfway through the duel, the puppet Kiku's hakama unfastens and drops to the floor, revealing an humongous, erect penis under the fundoshi, prompting everyone to leave disgusted. Kiku wasn't too amused.
-   Ban and Ginji actually try peeping on the very girlish-looking Kazuki in a hot spring in an episode of _Get Backers_, mistaking him for a girl at a distance. Later, Amon Natsuki hits on him and tries to pull an I Kiss Your Hand. Juubei merrily skewers them both times.
-   Happens in the anime _Girls Bravo_, where Fukuyama starts hitting on and eventually sticks his hand into the panties of a crossdressing Yukinari . His reaction is not pleasant considering the fact that he is extremely androphobic and is allergic to other men.
-   An oddly sexuality-inverted version occurs in _Glass Fleet_ when Holy Emperor Vetti Sforza finally manages to get Michel Volban, the leader of La Résistance, into his clutches... and, upon drugging Michel in order to have his way with him, discovers that Michel is actually a woman. Vetti seems rather put out about it.
-   At least three times in _GTO: The Early Years_, with different reactions each time:
    -   Jun Kamata reveals that his "sister" Kaoru Kamata is actually an Attractive Bent-Gender Crossdresser. However, Eikichi, who Kaoru ends up falling for, never finds out. Kaoru doesn't disappear after that arc, playing a supporting role in later chapters. In the 2020 live-action drama Eikichi does find out (and defends him/her from a transphobic/homophobic teacher).
    -   The attractive female neighbor who Eikichi and Ryuji spy on through a hole in the wall is revealed to be a Drag Queen who pranks whoever moves into the neighboring room by pretending to be a masturbating woman. This one is mostly Played for Laughs and the boys are treated as having deserved it for peeping.
    -   Misato Hazuki, who Eikichi seemed to be seriously in love with, is revealed to be a trans woman. The normally sympathetic Shinomi shows an ugly transphobic side (possibly because she felt her own Belligerent Sexual Tension with Eikichi was threatened), but Eikichi is devastated when Misato leaves town, and his best friend Ryuji is understanding.
-   _Hanaukyō Maid Team_: In one episode, Taro dresses up as a maid. The other maids (except the one who convinced him to do so) are really shocked when he reveals his true self.
-   _Hatsukoi Zombie_ starts with one: the New Transfer Student in chapter 1 has the same name and face as the girl the protagonist Tarou liked as a child. Turns out he's a very male boy who used to dress as a girl because of his mother's weird tastes. Except not really. She really is a girl, but decided to pass as a guy because she didn't want any more boys to fall in love with her: she can see "first love zombies", and wasn't too fond of seeing multiple, scantily clad versions of herself floating in the air.
-   _Hayate the Combat Butler_:
    -   Poor Hayate gets forced into female clothing often, and there have been several cases of this. However, the most amusing was when he had to crossdress in order to attend an anime convention, and ends up having to fight a giant robot while wearing a maid costume. Naturally, this makes all the fanboys happy and taking pictures, even mentioning 'I saw white!' only to have Hayate respond that he's a guy. Their response? HE'S A TRAP! and, of course, take more pictures.
    -   Luca, a pop star that Hayate helps after the robot hurts her, falls for it too, even going so far as to change in front of him. Due to the large amount of stress she's under, Hayate tries to keep up the disguise, digging deeper and deeper with lies. The plan finally fails when she gets into a bath that he's in, along with more than one of his female classmates.
    -   One butler falls in love with Hayate, who at the moment is under a crossdressing curse (...). Although initially devastated when Hayate's cover is blown, he quickly comes around and tries to convince Hayate to travel with him to the Netherlands, where same-sex marriages are legal. (Cue Nagi's Megaton Kick.)
-   Lesbian variant: In the first OVA of _El-Hazard: The Magnificent World_, Makoto is forced to pose as the missing princess Fatora. Apparently, he pulls this off a little too well, because Fatora's lesbian lover Alielle climbs into bed with him. Her response basically boils down to: "Well, that's new... wait a minute... Oh, my God!" The episode ends with both of them screaming. In _The Alternative World_, the real Fatora tries to return the favor to Alielle, but instead finds Alielle's very similar twin brother. "It just went... squish."
-   In _HeartCatch Pretty Cure!_, Tsubomi quickly becomes smitten with the handsome Student Council President Itsuki. When she learns that "he" is actually a handsome girl, she's upset and shocked enough to end up staying home with a fever.
    -   Cobraja ends up choosing Itsuki to be a Desertian (mostly) because he thinks she's a beautiful man. Then when Itsuki-as-a-Desertian swoons over a girl's uniform and reveals her actual gender, he promptly freaks.
    -   Also it's implied that before all these happened, Erika also had the same unsettling experience and stayed home with a fever like Tsubomi.
-   Classic example: Shun from _Here is Greenwood_. He's used for a prank because of this, and the reveal (more rage-inducing than unsettling) comes when he's caught in front of a urinal.
-   Happens to people of both genders in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_.
    -   Everyone in the surroundings of Chibitalia mistook him for a girl until he hit puberty. In this fan comic, Holy Roman Empire gets the Chibitalia bridge dropped on him.
    -   Hungary herself used to be so tomboyish that she was mistaken as a boy by her rivals, and she herself thought she was a boy due to chronic lack of sex-ed in these times. It wasn't until she was a teenager that other nations realized Hungary was a girl, starting with her old rival Prussia when he sees her badly beaten after a battle and notices that her blouse and armor are torn to Navel-Deep Neckline levels, much to his surprise.
    -   Also, Hong Kong used to be mistaken as a Bifauxnen, when in reality he's male.
    -   China. Then again, Dude Looks Like a Lady and has a girlish voice.
    -   At one point, Italy calls Germany for help because "There was a pretty girl, so I hit on her, but it turns out the pretty girl was France in disguise!" Since France has a noticeable beard, one has to wonder how Italy made that mistake. Then again...
    -   Germany referred to Kugelmugel as a boy, much to Liechtenstein's surprise, though she reacts with confusion over why he calls "her" a male rather than shock.
-   _High School D×D_:
    -   When Issei is reminded of a childhood friend of his, he recalls this friend as a boy. He is quite surprised when the friend comes back several years later as an (attractive) girl, though the friend (Irina) laughs it off because she was very tomboyish back then and she could see how he made the mistake.
    -   A running gag with Gasper Vladi the vampire, whose manner of dress and speaking makes it very easy for him to be mistaken as a cute girl.

-   A mild version pops up in _How I Became a Pokémon Card_. Akira and his best friend Akari, a transgender boy, are beginning junior high, and uniforms come into play. Akari has to wear the female uniform, which provokes Akira to mention how he didn't believe Akari really was a "girl".
-   _Ice Revolution_ is one long series of dropped Bridgets after martial artist and extreme Tomboy (so extreme her hairdresser likens her to a fellow transgender person) Masaki decides to take up the very girly sport of figure skating, culminating in her dropping a Bridget on an entire ice arena when she appears on the ice at her first public performance wearing a skating dress. Everyone at the rink had just assumed she was a boy up until that point.
-   In the first episodes of _Inazuma Eleven Orion no Kokuin_, Iwato writes love letters to somebody named Hikaru, whom he has a crush on despite knowing nothing about that person other than the name. In episode 8, he receives a letter where Hikaru reveals he's a guy, which shocks him enough to keep him awake all night.
-   Happens twice with Charlotte in _Infinite Stratos_: the first when Ichika has a Shower of Awkward Full-Frontal Assault moment with her, and the second to a larger percentage of the school when she reintroduces herself.
-   _Iono the Fanatics_: Well, Dropped a Bridget on Her really. However, inverted. Iono not only isn't uncomfortable with Tomo Senoo when she finds out the cute girl she was crushing on is a he, she's actually impressed... although this does disqualify him from becoming one of her concubines.
    
    **Iono:** Who would have thought even a dedicated skirt chaser like me could have been fooled.
    
-   In _Ixion Saga DT_, Kon instantly becomes attracted to the hot maid Mariandale... until she's revealed to be a transgender woman. Whenever she reverts to her original male voice, he's creeped out.
-   In _I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying_ Hajime hooks up his friend Miki with his younger sister. Said friend was not aware of the fact that said younger sister is actually Hijime's clingy cross dressing younger brother.
    
    **Miki**: Your sister has a palm tree and coconuts! Arabiki... elephant... wiener! \*\*\*k o\* destiny!
    
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   _Stardust Crusaders_: While posing as a boy aboard Captain Tennille's ship, Anne is revealed to be a girl when she gets knocked overboard and Jotaro jumps in afterward to rescue her from sharks. Upon pulling her out of the water, he accidentally grabs her chest, and then after a very awkward pause between the two, Jotaro takes off her cap to reveal her long hair underneath.
    -   _Stone Ocean_: Anasui's original appearance (in the manga) is as a woman, presumably using Diver Down's internal restructuring ability to give him a disguise to infiltrate the women's prison ward. Later, when she finds out, Ermes is actually pretty surprised to find that Anasui's actually male.
    -   _Steel Ball Run_: Johnny founds out that Hot Pants is a woman by accidentally almost touching her breasts.
    -   _The JoJoLands_: When Dragona is sexually assaulting by an officer, the cop sticks his hand into Dragona's thong and finds out he's a man. Though, it's disturbingly subverted when the cop makes a comment that suggests he's turned on by this.
-   _Jubei-chan 2_. Dropped on the audience _and_ on Jiyu, who spent the entire series thinking this person was either chibi spirit Koinosuke or reincarnated baby Koinosuke... only for it to end up being Koinosuke's never-before-mentioned daughter who looks exactly like him.
-   Happened to Karin in _Kamichama Karin_ at the end of volume 4 finding out her crush, Kirika-senpai, is female through an incident of seeing (and accidentally feeling) her revealed cleavage in an unconscious state. The audience gets the Bridget dropped on them first as it's revealed in an earlier chapter.
-   In episode 6 of _Kämpfer_, Natsuru inadvertently does this to Mikoto when his identity is compromised. Apparently, his clothes only change during transformations if he/she is wearing the Seitetsu Academy uniform.
-   In _Karakuridouji Ultimo_, Service, who up till then was the source of much Viewer Gender Confusion, got his shirt blown off during a fight in Chapter 23, revealing... a flat chest. We next see Yamato's face with an expression of pure shock. The fandom was mind-blowned too.
-   In _Kingdom Hearts II_, Sora finds out that "Ping" is female by accidentally getting a glimpse of her breasts while both are washing up at the lake. His reaction to The Reveal is priceless, especially if you compare the scene with the one from the game, where he and Donald find out via Goofy.
-   Ichika Usami of _KiraKira★Pretty Cure à la Mode_ ends up falling head over heels for Akira Kenjou, whom she doesn't realize isn't a boy. _Not even when Akira turns into Cure Chocolat right in front of her_ (to be fair, Cure Chocolat is one handsome Precure when transformed). It takes the end of the episode and Ichika's dad pointing it out for her to realize what's going on.
    
    **Ichika:** You're... you're a womaaaaaaaaaaan?!
    
-   The episode of _Kochikame_ in which Maria is introduced. His real name is Ai Asato and he became a woman after falling in love with his old coach, who looked a lot like Ryotsu. When Ryotsu himself meets Maria, he immediately falls in love with Maria, up to the point of marriage. Luckily Ryotsu manages to realize in time that Maria is a man, by accidentally feeling Maria's private parts.
-   An episode of _Kodocha_ has a subplot where one of Sana's friends develops a crush on an upperclassman tennis player. When she confesses her love, the object of her crush explains that she's a girl.
-   In _Lovely★Complex_, Otani has one when he learns that Seiko, the girl he was dating, is a trans woman. He's initially shocked upon the discovery and can barely face her for a few days, but he recovers and becomes friends with her.
-   _Love Live! Sunshine!!_: The post-series film, _Over The Rainbow_, has the now second and third years of Aquors catching You Watanabe seemingly on a date with a dark-haired boy. After some time spying on them only to be caught by You, the "boy", Tsuki, is not only revealed to be a girl but also You's cousin. The other girls collapse to the floor in disbelief of their mistake.
-   Alto Saotome from _Macross Frontier_, a former Kabuki actor who often played female roles, gets this a lot... but trust us, he's certainly not happy about it. In one episode a salesman mistakes him for a girl and tries to sell him women's clothing, to which Alto angrily points at his Adam's apple and says "Does THIS look like a woman to you?!" Teammate Mikael loves to jerk Alto's chain by referring to him as "Princess Alto" and similar nicknames.
-   In _Maria†Holic_ Kanako, the lesbian protagonist, meets the girl of her dreams in the form of the Mariya after transferring to all girls school. Later she walks in on Mariya changing and discovers _his_ secret. She spends the rest of the series being relentlessly bullied by him into keeping his secret and suffering innumerable Stupid Sexy Flanders moments.
-   In _Mayo Chiki!_, the butler for a local rich girl, Konoe Subaru, is actually a girl. She was allowed to be a butler, which is a men's only profession, on the condition that she can hide her gender from the students at school. Her cover is nearly blown when Ordinary High-School Student Jiro accidentally finds it out. But luckily for her, he agrees to keep it a secret (largely due to blackmail from said local rich girl, who also promises to help cure his gynophobia, or fear of women, as he suffers from nosebleeds anytime a woman touches him).
-   _Michiko & Hatchin_:
    -   Hatchin is only ten and has Boyish Short Hair for most of the series. More than a few people mistake her for a boy.
    -   One episode has Hatchin meeting a soft-spoken-looking girl her age. When his father leaves he reveals himself to be a jerkass and then reveals himself to really be a boy when he pulls up his dress. Bebel crossdresses because he wants to get into travesty acting like his dad.
-   _Mnemosyne_: Big Bad Apos's reveal as being intersex has some truly ominous implications. Your sex governs your powers in Mnemosyne's setting so Apos gets a full shot of everything and then some.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_: Tieria Erde, although his voice and personality help to only keep the viewer in the dark for parts of the first episode. Still, his girly looks and the fact that he wears a fuzzy pink sweater when not burninating the countryside in his Gundam cause enough of a double-take to fit him in here. To add to the confusion, the people making the show claimed Innovators have no sex. They actually meant that they were androgynous. It was just badly translated and underwent Memetic Mutation before the correction came around. He doesn't make it any easier in the 2nd season, when it's shown that when it's needed, he _can_ really fill out a ballgown. Maybe Eiji gave him some tips...
-   Jan Suk in _Monster_ starts confiding in a cute blonde girl he met at a bar. Not only is she actually a man, but she's _Johan_, who had been impersonating his twin sister as part of a plot to make her question her sanity, and his disguise and behavior were convincing enough that even the audience doesn't suspect the truth. The eventual reveal has caused anime clubs to riot.
-   _Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun_:
    -   Wakamatsu is subject to this in Chapter 45. While spending time with the girls while they're swimsuit shopping, he assumes that Kashima is a boy (and didn't like him because of it), and it isn't until the very end that he's informed otherwise.
    -   The stinger of episode 8 of the anime reveals that this happened to Hori, with regards to Kashima. When they first met, Hori assumed that Kashima was a boy, despite the obvious signs indicating otherwise, like that she wears a skirt with her uniform. It wasn't until he saw her head to use the _girls'_ bathroom that he realized she was a girl. Up until then, he has treated her like a buddy kohai.
-   In _Moyashimon_, a certain cute goth-loli attired girl is not all she seems. Oikawa goes on a rampage when this is revealed to her after she witnesses a kiss. It turns out the Elegant Gothic Lolita wearing character is actually Kei Yuuki, a biologically male character who was Put on the Bus several chapters in. She also seems to like the protagonist.
-   _MM!_ has Tatsukichi himself. The Crossdressing Voices help out a lot. Taro then gets disappointed since his crush in the first episode is his cross-dressing friend.
-   _Naruto_: During the Land of Waves Story Arc, Naruto meets Haku, whom he takes for a girl (Not that this is hard), and Haku corrected him on this assumption right before he left.
    
    **Haku**: Oh, and by the way? I'm a boy. \[goes away\]  
    **Naruto:** No way?! He's prettier than Sakura!
    
-   Natsume Takashi from _Natsume's Book of Friends_ tends to get mistaken for his grandmother, Reiko, by Youkai on an almost constant basis. One of these Youkai is Hinoe, who _really_ liked Reiko and Does Not Like Men. She gets as far as groping Natsume's non-existent breasts before she learns her mistake.
    
    **Hinoe:** ... _Where are your boobs!?_
    
-   _Nise x Koi Boyfriend_:
    -   In the first story of _Nise x Koi Boyfriend_ this occurs to the protagonist with his own boyfriend. He saw a girl and asked her out. It turns out his 'girlfriend' was actually a boy from his school crossdressing. Satoi didn't intend for that to happen. He thought Soutarou _knew_ he was crossdressing and realized who he was. When Soutarou learns who his boyfriend is he becomes mad at Satoi because he thought it was a prank. He doesn't mind dating Satoi after learning Satoi honestly liked him.
    -   Two men tried to pick up Satoi without realizing he's a crossdresser. When they do learn they act violently, though Soutarou helps save Satoi.
-   The appropriately-titled _No Bra_ centers around a guy who finds out that his Forgotten Childhood Friend Yuki is actually a guy, despite what he looks like.<small>◊</small>
-   Poor Masamunya has one dropped by the title character of _Nyanpire: The Animation_ seconds after developing a crush on him. In a later episode, he fantasizes about marrying him and even get's jealous of seeing him drinking blood from Nyatenshi.
-   _NEEDLESS_: After Blade rescues a crossdressing Cruz, he goes catatonic in response to his real, male identity. Blades restores himself to consciousness upon concluding that Cruz is cute enough that is doesn't matter.
-   In _Otomen_, when he was a little boy, Kasuga developed a crush on his sweet, gentle cousin. Flash-forward ten years, and imagine his shock when he learned that his cousin grew up to be a tall, handsome guy.
-   The audience of _Otoboku - Maidens Are Falling For Me_ gets the main character Mizuho's gender dropped on _them_ — if they didn't read the series synopsis before watching the first episode. Most of them, mortified at having cheered at the fanservice, firmly invoked the First Law of Gender Bending in their minds.
-   _Ouran High School Host Club_:
    -   Happens to several characters when they discover Haruhi's real gender, most notably Tamaki, Kasanoda, and in the last chapter, the _entire_ female customer base of the Host Club. And then Double Subverted when Haruhi tries to explain the truth of her sex to the club's customers, the girls assure her that they've known all along and don't mind a bit. Only later, after Haruhi and Tamaki have left for America, is it revealed that what they "knew all along" was that Haruhi was a gay crossdresser and that Tamaki was in love with "him."
    -   Surprisingly does _not_ happen with Haruhi's Drag Queen father Ranka. The host club knows that he's her father from the moment he enters the scene.
-   Author Mineyo Maya of _Patalliro!_. Fans are shocked to find out that the shounen-ai author is a happily married man with three kids.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   In the anime, Brock wound up subverting this on one occasion. He knew something was wrong when a ridiculously sexy scientist _didn't_ make him delusional. Turned out to be a man in disguise working for Team Magma. In a later episode, he identifies the same disguised man out of two otherwise indistinguishable Jennies by the same lack of a Raging Stiffie.
    -   And then later he accidentally hits on Harley.
    -   He also failed to realize that Anabel was a Bifauxnen:
        
        **Brock:** Hey, you're not changing with Ash and me? Is it because of May?  
        **Anabel:** No, it's because even if I don't look like the part... I'm a girl.
        
    -   Brock also sometimes falls for Ash whenever he dressed up as a girl.
    -   An example between Pokémon: Meowth and Ash's Oshawott both fall for a Purrloin (who take their attraction to his advantage and hid his gender). The expressions on their faces following the surprise revelation are priceless. The pairing name for this Purrloin/Meowth became, appropriately enough, Bridgetshipping.
-   _Pokémon Adventures_:
    
    **Gold:** Hi there miss. Isn't it lonely to do sightseeing by yourself? Wanna go for a cup of tea together? The name's Gold. I'm from New Bark Town.  
    **Bugsy:** I... I'm Bugsy from Azalea Town. And... well... I'm a _guy_.
    
-   Another Bugsy example happened in _Pokémon Golden Boys_, another adaptation of _Pokémon Gold and Silver_. When meeting Gold, Bugsy referred to himself as "... a bug keeper boy..." which provoked a "You're a boy?" from Gold. Nothing else was noted though.
-   _Princess Jellyfish_:
    -   In the first episode Tsukimi allows a woman who helped her to sleep in her all-female dorm. The next morning Kuranosuke is revealed to be male when he wakes up with disheveled clothes.
    -   This is subverted several other times. Tsukimi's friends, who are afraid of men, fail to notice that Kuranosuke is male even when they find out he pads his bra (they assume he's just _very_ small chested).
-   The "tomboyish girl wears a hat and The Reveal happens when the hat's dropped and you see her long hair" also happens to Kunimitsu Tezuka from _The Prince of Tennis_, when he meets Miyuki Chitose. Except it's Girlish Pigtails instead of long hair.
-   The backstory of _Prism_ has Megu spending a romantic day with a boy back in grade school... only to discover on her first day of high school that Hikaru is actually a _girl_.
-   _Prunus Girl_: Logically, Maki "knows" that Aikawa is a guy, but he still can't help but be frequently embarrassed by Aikawa's antics (and occasionally be tempted to take up offers to personally verify gender). Meanwhile, his friend Kadoyama is hopeless over Aikawa, declaring "who cares as long as (s)he's cute!" and getting really worked up. A nameless herd of classmates seem to agree.
-   Episode 5 of _Punchline_ reveals the fact that Yuuta is biologically female to the girls. It isn't until later that it's revealed that he is a boy named Pine who bodyswapped with Chiyoko years ago.
-   _Ranma ½_:
    -   This happens to Akane at the very beginning of the series. She wasn't exactly thrilled to find out that the shy and awkward girl she had just made friends with was actually a guy.
    -   A subversion: Hiroshi and Daisuke's discovery that the cute redheaded girl they were hot for is actually their male best friend does absolutely _nothing_ to stifle their lust ("Why can't there be more girls like him?").
    -   This happens to Ranma too, when he tries to romance Tsubasa to get "her" to give up on Ukyô and his own female side. His reaction to finding out Tsubasa is a _male_ Master of Disguise (which includes crossdressing as a girl) is not pretty.
    -   Everyone believes Konatsu to be the legendary Genius Kunôichi (female ninja), and have even braced themselves for her coming out of the closet to confess undying love for Ukyô. Then a stray bomb goes off, blows apart Konatsu's outfit, and reveals "she" is a very feminine-looking "he". Ukyô is just as stunned as everyone.
-   Himemaru in _Rappi Rangai_. Despite being born male, he decided to become a kunôichi because he had the "prettiest face in the village," though Kisarabi claims it was because he didn't want to put himself through the hard training to become an actual male shinobi. In either case, he seduced Raizou in his introductory chapter, and even after his secret came out he continued making passes at him every so often.
-   In _Adolescence of Utena_, the _Revolutionary Girl Utena_ movie, Utena is so bifauxnen that one of the main characters (Saionji) thinks she's a guy until halfway into a duel when he manages to cut her shirt open. While surprised, it's only evident in his choice of words, his face and voice remain as level as ever (for him) and he continues to attack her.
-   _The Rose of Versailles_:
    -   In the anime the Duke of Orleans tried to invoke this by having a very girlish and young-looking henchman impersonate Marie-Antoinette, thus ruining the marriage to the Dauphin. It doesn't work, since Oscar manages to stop him and Marie shows up in time.
    -   Also tends to happen fairly often that Oscar herself is mistaken for a _gorgeous_ man, only for Oscar or someone in the known to clear the mistake and unsettle the poor woman. Note that this did _nothing_ to stop the creation of a rather large all-female fan club for Oscar...
-   _Rurouni Kenshin_:
    -   Villainous Crossdresser Kamatari drops this on his opponent Misao (and everyone defending the Aoiya as well) quite dramatically, complete with pixellated naughty bits. Note that particular scene was only in the manga; in the anime he _does_ reveal his gender too, but without flashing anything.
    -   Kenshin himself often causes this with viewers, and the fact that he's voiced by a woman in the original Japanese makes it worse (and legend has it that the character designer for _Guilty Gear_ first came up with the character Baiken after making this mistake) and he's in fact based on a historical samurai, Kawakami Gensai, who used his feminine appearance to get close to his targets and even managed to assassinate a man in broad daylight. He even hid out in a brothel at one point after an assassination.
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   In the first anime Minako manages to nonchalantly gush over Haruka a few times well after everyone else was clued in to her being a girl.
    -   In the _Stars_ season, Minako, who had been a total fangirl over the boy band the Three Lights, states that all her love for them has disappeared after finding out they were really girls in disguise. She could have also been trying to lighten the mood since Usagi was hurt that people she viewed as friends (mainly Seiya) had kept such a secret from them.
    -   In an early episode of the anime's _R_ season, Mamoru and Usagi team up to take care of a baby named Manami whose mother is hospitalised after an attack from the Monster of the Week. When they change the baby's diapers, it turns out Manami is a boy and not a girl; he has a Gender-Blender Name and had been referred to with gender-neutral pronouns. (The dubs generally handle it by referring to the baby as a girl first, and then as a boy.)
-   In _Sakura Gari_, we have a boy named Youya... better known as Sakurako Saiki. This is _not_ Played for Laughs as s/he is an insane, thoroughly broken Yandere, who ends up Driven to Suicide.
-   Much to the shock of the heroes of _Samurai Champloo_, this is not the case with the tourist they meet in one episode. Granted he IS surprised to find out the kabuki actor he had a crush on is a man, but it's a pleasant surprise.
-   _Sazanami Cherry_:
    -   When Ren reveal himself to be a crossdresser the protagonist is confused at first however gets over it and dates him.
    -   Ren gets one of these from _his own sister_. His sister is considerably older than him and he didn't know she was transgender.
-   _School Rumble: Second Semester_ plays this straight at the end of the third episode. One of the characters present lampshades the moment beautifully.
    
    "What... the hell?"
    
-   In _The Secret Devil-chan_: Kurosaki Sou discovers this about Devil-chan, after just 10 pages into the manga.
-   In the beginning of episode 5 of _Servant × Service_, Yamagami woke up from being drunk and saw a woman that looked suspiciously like her coworker Yutaka Hasebe next to her. The latter then said she was indeed Hasebe and asked Yamagami to hide it from their coworkers, causing the latter to go Blue with Shock. As it turned out, it was subverted. Hasebe brought Yamagami to his sister Kaoru's apartment, and it was Kaoru who was sleeping next to Yamagami—and messing with Yamagami for fun.
-   Played for Laughs with Karara's debut in _Sgt. Frog_: Tamama spends the entire episode flitting between jealousy at the thought of being replaced as the platoon's cute tadpole and being charmed by the new 'recruit's' Hero Worship of him. Then, when Karara heads home, _she_ promises to become a good future bride for him...
-   _Shaman King_ has Amamiya Ryu aka Bokuto no Ryu, who thinks that Lyserg Diethel is a girl at first. When Lyserg reveals his gender, Ryu can't believe it until Lyserg either lets him check in his underwear (2001 anime) or drops his pants in front of everyone (manga). Ryu doesn't seem to care and remains very protective and devoted to Lyserg even after Lyserg's Face–Heel Turn and defection to the X-Laws.
-   _Shimoneta_: It happens to Tanukichi _and_ the readers in chapter 10, when he mistakes Oboro for a member of Gathered Fabric and wrestles him to the floor. Which is how his foot ends up trapped between Oboro's legs, directly on his bulge. Tanukichi uses his foot to double-check and inadvertently causes Oboro to silently arch his back. In the next set of panels, Oboro is seen smiling with a faint blush, while Tanukichi sweatdrops.
-   _Shugo Chara!_: Nadeshiko/Nagihiko, whose family has a long-standing tradition of making its boys dress, act, and, for all intents and purposes, _be_ girls for about the first twelve years of their lives. He had to repress all boyish desires, no matter how slight, and was forbidden from revealing his true gender to anyone.
-   _Slayers_:
    -   In the second season of the anime, during their tenure in a Lady Land kingdom for the cross-dressing episode, a disguised Zelgadis meets and becomes smitten with the kingdom's demure and burdened princess, Miwan. After he saves her from a water demon named Evia, Miwan declares herself free from her burdens...and promptly takes all of her clothes off and reveals herself as a man. It turns out that all of the Royal guard was formed by guys in exactly the same situation: like Miwan, they were raised as girls by their moms to not being killed or taken away.
    -   A side story in the novels also has Zelgadis encounter another girl, named Miranda, dressed as a male bounty hunter. During his fight with another chimera, her gender is revealed.
-   The main premise of '80s series _Stop Hibari Kun_. Main character Kohsaku moves in to his dead mother's yakuza friend and falls in love at first sight with the eldest and most beautiful of his four daughters... only to later find out that she is actually biologically male. Hilarity ensues.
-   Subverted in the adult manga _Sundome_; Sahana tells Hideo that she used to be a guy, but it's a trick to try to get him to stop masturbating so much. It Makes Sense in Context.
-   The relatively obscure manga and animated movie _They Were Eleven_ by Moto Hagio features an incredibly feminine recruit who is eventually revealed to be an alien who hasn't yet decided whether to be male or female, and actually became a recruit to avoid being forced to become a girl as well as a pawn in Arranged Marriage imposed by their family.
-   In the Hideshi Hino short story _Sailor Psycho_, a girl is invited to the school idol's house to paint her portrait. She ends up discovering that the school idol is really a crossdressing boy with a school uniform fetish. The girl is killed when she freaks out and we find out that the idol's "mother" is really his crossdresser father and the old caretakers of their mansion are _also_ crossdressers.
-   _Tomo-chan Is a Girl!_: In an expanded flashback to the start of middle school, Jun<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  responds to Tomo showing up in a girl's uniform with an "Okay bud, you got me" and a playful punch to the chest. Cue "squish" (_some_body's mom insisted on her daughter finally getting an actual bra rather than binding herself flat), followed by screaming (entirely on Jun's part, as while Tomo would have slugged anyone else in earnest for that _he_ is fine).
-   Shibisu from _Tower of God_ finds out that the Bull is a female by kicking it in the groin to no avail.
-   In _Vandread_, Bart Garsus gets a Bridget dropped on him with The Reveal that BC is a Gender Bender Mole. In the end, it doesn't stop him. If anything, it made it easier for him to accept his own feelings: the premise behind the whole series has men and women living on completely different planets — so same-sex "loves" were common practice.
-   A variation appears in _Kuroneko Guardian_. An actor is assigned a bodyguard who he believes is a boy until he walks in on her topless (when she was taking a shower).
-   In _Violence Jack_ both the audience and characters in universe think that Mondo’s friend Mido is a girl, it’s not until he’s held hostage and about to be executed by a gang member that his gender is revealed, he tells “her” that he might as well cop a feel before he executes her and finds that “she” has no breasts.
-   _Wandering Son_:
    -   This happens to Riku Seya, a classmate of the Nitori's older sister Maho and her eventual boyfriend. Seya saw Nitori dressed as a girl and became infatuated, and convinced Maho to set them up. A future date at the aquarium turns into a rather shocking revelation which is not helped by a friend of Nitori's, "Mako-chan" (no, not that one) also revealing herself as biologically male. Seya is left rather confused by it all but they eventually become friends.
    -   The series has had a few instances of the rare Transmasculine case too. For example, Shiina originally mistakes his (adult) girlfriend to be cheating with Takatsuki. He grabs his groin but notices he's biologically female. After it all clears up, Takatsuki and Shiina become good friends.
    -   On the first day of middle school Chizuru goes to school in a gakuran and is mistaken for a boy until her best friend berates a girl for doing so. Chi often screws with the schools uniform code, be it wearing a tie instead of a ribbon or just outright crossdressing.
    -   It's implied that Yuki knew Takatsuki was a trans boy, but she didn't realize Nitori was a trans girl. Neither of the two knew Yuki was a trans woman. The characters get a bit surprised at the reveals.
-   Subverted in _Wild Rock_. Yuuen dresses up as a girl for a Honey Trap plot, but eventually feels guilty and upset that Emba is in love with his female persona and decides to run away rather than "drop a bridget" on himself. He then finds out Emba actually knew all along but didn't mention it because he didn't want him to stop coming.
-   Chizuru from _You and Me_ mistakes the feminine looking Shun for a girl when he sees him in the gym uniform. Even when the others tell Chizuru otherwise he doesn't believe them. Chizuru doesn't acknowledge that Shun is male until he sees him in his school uniform for the first time, which causes him to faint.
-   _You're Under Arrest!_ uses it as a running gag with Aoi, whose crossdressing is treated fairly realistically:
    -   His in-canon introduction involved this trope, along with his new co-workers' reaction to the reveal.
    -   He invokes the trope deliberately in an episode of the anime, when he gets a marriage proposal from an Idol Singer that she's not interested in. Aoi asks for a meeting and shows up in male clothes, telling him about his issues. The guy respects Aoi's wish, withdraws the proposal, and they decide to stay friends.
-   This happens to Wataru Takatsuki in _Yubisaki Milk Tea_ in recent chapters. However, despite Yoshinori Ikeda's initial beliefs to the contrary, Wataru actually likes him even more.
-   Tetsuo from _Yuureitou_ is a trans man. It's always Played for Drama when he comes out. He's stated that in the past women have gotten mad at him when he does.
-   _YuYu Hakusho_:
    -   Happens to a couple of Kuwabara's schoolmates at the end of _YuYu Hakusho_ when they mistake Kurama for Kuwabara's pretty girlfriend. In the anime he's nonchalant and even jokes a little about it, but in the manga he gets homicidally angry.
    -   Miyuki of the Triad looks very feminine, but is revealed as biologically male during her fight with Yusuke. In the manga, Yusuke is shown as somewhat nauseated before getting over it, and in the anime he and Botan don't even care; Yusuke's only problem with her is Miyuki's in between him and rescuing Yukina. Kuwabara, on the other hand, is extremely squicked, getting disgusted looks from Yusuke and Botan over it, _and_ gets a whack from Botan's oar when he tries to look for himself.
-   When Kouji Nanjo from _Zetsuai (1989)_ was a young boy, he once saw a rage-filled, beautiful tomboy named Izumi. He fell in love with her at first sight, but she disappeared from his life as fast as she arrived. Several years later, Kouji is watching a high school soccer game and recognizes one of the players, soccer star _Takuto_ Izumi, as the young girl who captivated him, since "Izumi" was the kid's _surname_. After quite some Gayngst about it, Kouji quickly decides that it doesn't change his feelings for Izumi.

-   A fresco was found in Pompeii where the god Pan flees from Hermaphroditus after getting frisky and uncovering their bottom half. It is unclear whether a genuine myth is behind the painting.

    Comedy 

-   Doug Stanhope: "\[Transvestites nowadays\] are _good!_ You don't even have to pretend you got tricked any more!"
-   Patton Oswalt claims this is his favorite reason to watch _Cops_, even going so far as to give a name to the duped person's reaction: "The Transvestite Revelation Face".

    Comic Books 

-   In _Camelot 3000_, Tom Prentice awakens memories of Camelot in Sir Tristan's reincarnation, who happens to be a gorgeous young woman. Tom's instant crush on the reborn Tristan plays out this trope. Ultimately it proves hopeless, as Tristan refuses to accept life as a hetero female, eventually entering a lesbian relationship with Isolde's reincarnation.
-   Even DC Comics' woman-lovin', homicidal, Anti-Hero Lobo has had this happen to him. In "Lobo's Big Babe Special", he is hired as a bodyguard for an intergalactic beauty pageant. But each of the ladies in the pageant has one nasty surprise or another (even the ones he knew!) and were subsequently eliminated. Each of them, that is, except the extremely busty T.V., the one Lobo has been drooling over the entire time. Once T.V. was crowned the winner, the horny Main Man made his move, despite her subtle hints that it wasn't a good idea. Finally, T.V. tells him to "put your hand _here_." Lobo and everyone reading now knows what the name "T.V." stands for...
-   One EC Comics story features human astronauts being forced to land on an uncharted planet to repair their ship. Commander Morrison falls for a beautiful female native and chooses to stay and marry her. Things go well, if a bit strangely, at first, but soon his new wife starts changing, cutting her hair short, losing her curves and spurning his advances. Morrison investigates, and comes to realize to his shock that the natives are biologically similar to snails. When he gets back home, his brand new _husband_ expresses his hopes that Morrison will hurry up and change, so things can get back to normal.
-   _Hellblazer_: Played with in the "Ashes and Dust" arc. While interviewing a female witness named Joey, Agent Turro calls her a "pretty girl." Joey gives a mischievous smile and pulls her panties down. We don't see what she shows him, but a suggestively-placed microphone implies she has a penis. Turro is NOT unsettled and actually grins back.
    
    **Agent Frank Turro:** So which is fake... that, or the boobs?
    
    **Joey:** Honey, once they figure out how to implant one of these, _everybody'll_ have one.
    
-   Subverted in _Jem and the Holograms (IDW)_. Blaze feels the need to come out as a trans woman to her all-female band, however they don't care at all and her being trans is a non-issue.
-   In _Promethea_, this happens to Dennis Drucker, who finds out that his goddess lover (one incarnation of the eponymous Promethea) is actually comic book artist William Woolcott. This ends about as humorously as most Real Life examples of this trope.
-   Klara Prast of the Runaways was appalled when Xavin suddenly transformed from a tall white guy to a pretty black girl during their first encounter. She got over it, eventually.
-   Between X-Men characters Scott, Jean and Warren in _Marvel 1602_. Jean is a Bifauxnen who has been disguised as "John Grey" as part of her education, and when Warren shows up, he starts hitting on her. Scott confronts him angrily, revealing the secret that Warren must have obviously glimpsed... only for Warren to reveal he had no idea "John" was a woman.
-   Grant Morrison's _Zenith_ had the title character propositioned by Metamaid, an attractive transgender superheroine. After Zenith finds out, he passes the buck to the naive young superhero TNT Tom by suggesting that he and Metamaid might like to get acquainted. At least it apparently ends happily for both parties.
    
    **Zenith:** TNT Tom left with a smile on his face, mind...

    **Dean:** Damn hippies...
    

    Fan Works

-   Near-future dystopian novel _Victoria_ subjects the villainous Governor Hokem to this, with two attractive Camp Gay drag queens dressing up as party girls and getting him into a compromising position, resulting in blackmail and ultimately the end of his administration.
-   Lois McMaster Bujold's _Vorkosigan Saga_: A variation of this happens to Ivan Vorpatril in _A Civil Campaign_ when he, realizing how slim pickings were for long-term female companionship, decides to intercept his old (and older) lover Lady Donna Vorryuter on her way back from Beta Colony (something related to an inheritance dispute surrounding her brother the late Count Vorryuter) and perhaps renew matters with said divorcee. Now who is that fellow with the black beard accompanying the Vorryuter Armsmen and why do his eyes look so familiar?

    Live-Action TV 

-   One episode of _1000 Ways to Die_ features a rapist targeting a lady as she leaves a gym. As it so happens, the "lady" is a cross-dressing semi-pro boxer who kills the rapist with one punch.
-   _All in the Family_: In the 1975 episode "Archie the Hero", Archie saves the life of someone named Beverly LaSalle, who he thinks is a highly attractive woman ... only to realize (upon being told) that Beverly is a cross-dressing man. (Beverly had passed out in the back of Archie's taxi cab.)
-   _Arrested Development_: Shows up in more than one context:
    -   Invoked and subverted by Maeby, who wants Steve Holt to think Lindsay is her _father_, not her mother. She goes so far as to buy her mother a shirt with a label "in French":
    -   Barry Zuckerkorn apparently _seeks out_ this trope, exclusively:
        
        **Barry:** Hey, you're not one of those silly men that’s dressed like a woman, are you?  
        **Prostitute:** No, baby, I'm the real thing. _\[Barry floors it and drives away.\]_
        
-   Similarly(ish): transgender woman Nadia Almeida, who won the fifth series of _Big Brother UK_ didn't tell her housemates of her... "situation". Said Bridget was Dropped upon evicted housemates in her post-eviction interview, until LGBT rights campaigners complained about five weeks into the game.
-   _Big Sky_: Jerrie shows Ronald her body (she's transgender) after he makes her strip and wash, in hopes of that ruining his plan to sell her as a sex slave (because apparently he only wants cis women) and he reacts with shock at seeing this.
-   The first episode of the second series of _Blackadder_ inverts this trope. The episode opens with a beautiful but poor young woman named Kate deciding to disguise herself as a boy to find work and support her ailing father. She finds a job as Edmund's manservant, and the two fall in love over the course of the episode while he tries desperately to cognitively reframe the feelings he's having for another man. The relief he feels when she reveals her true gender is immense.
    
    **Blackadder:** Then come, kiss me, Kate!
    
-   _Bones_:
    -   The subplot of an episode revolved around the team trying to figure out whether a Japanese assistant is a man or a woman. It is debated at some length before Angela figures it out in her own way. The character is a man...the actress is a woman.
    -   Another episode has the team realize that the victim was a transgender woman. This had absolutely nothing to do with the murder.
-   An attempt to use this trope using a real-life trans person caused some controversy among the LGBT community in an episode of reality show _Cake Boss_, where Buddy invites Carmen Carrera (best known for being on _RuPaul's Drag Race_) and sets her up on a date with "cousin Anthony", the punchline being the reveal to Anthony that his date was "really" a man, with his shocked reaction Played for Laughs. Though usually thought of as a Drag Queen, since she was one before she started transitioning, Carmen is actually a trans woman and was _not amused_ when made aware of the nature of her appearance on the show, citing the fact that this has led to real life murders of trans people. Buddy later apologized for the incident and the episode was removed from rotation.
-   _CASUAL+Y_ once featured two patients from a car crash: a girl and her strangely high-pitched voiced boyfriend. The doctors realised the boyfriend needed a chest examination. This revealed what certainly wasn't a boy's chest.
-   Parodied(?) in an episode of _Celebrity Juice_. Host Keith Lemon, in the episode following "Let's Dance for Comic Relief", in which he was a competitor with dancing partner Paddy Mc Guinness, opened the show saying that said partner got off with 'Roberta' Webb- only to discover 'she' had a 'tallywhacker'. 'Roberta' being Robert "Mitchell and" Webb, another competitor who performed "Flashdance" in a leotard and frizzy wig.
-   A one-episode B-plot in _Century City_ followed a lawsuit a man filed against a female-looking Hermaphrodite for causing him to question his sexuality. The case was dropped when he turned out to be trans too, but an in-universe ad for penis attachment surgery led to the observation that "someone should sue somebody for something."
-   _Chicago Hope_ did it in the middle of its run when one of the doctors, a very manly hockey player, starts dating Mia Sara. When she informs that she has something to tell him, he says that he already knows... that she has fake boobs and he's fine with it, she informs him that she actually used to be his best friend and hockey teammate in high school.
-   Having just consummated his relationship with the gorgeous model Azure C. (and taken her virginity, no less), _The City (1995)_'s Bernardo has just gone out to get some coffee when he sees a tabloid headline revealing that she used to be a _man_.
-   Happened once to Sanchez from _The Closer_. He made the mistake of hitting on (and kissing) a pretty female witness...who turned out to be the perp in drag. In a somewhat darkly humorous twist, this was the incident that convinced him to start actually going to the mandatory therapy sessions with the department shrink. (Mandatory because he was still suffering from PTSD after taking the bullet in the previous season finale; up until this incident, he'd been in denial about it.) Poor, poor Sanchez.
-   _Community_: Pierce has to be corrected as to the gender of the singer that made Hawthorne Wipes a gay icon. The same singer is seen later on, arm in arm with Chang, leading to this beautifully ironic line:
-   In _Cory in the House_, it happens to Newt Livingstone when Cory poses as his sister Raven (for reasons too convoluted to get into here) and Newt falls for him despite "her" clearly being his best friend in a dress and a wig. Then again, Wig, Dress, Accent was a staple of _CITH_'s parent show _That's So Raven_, and Newt is very stupid.
-   _Control Z_: Most of the school, including her boyfriend, are appalled when Isabela's revealed to be transgender. He dumps her, most of the girls shun Isabela, she's labeled male, questioned about her genitals and generally mocked or bullied. However, they are shown to be clearly in the wrong, and it's why Isabela wasn't open about her identity with them.

-   _CSI: NY_: The victim in "The Lying Game" is a mid-transition transgender woman who was killed due to a violent reaction by someone she was hitting on after he discovered the truth by groping her.
-   In an episode of _Dark Angel_, politically and socially conservative Normal discovers that his love interest is a trans woman. Unusually, he remains interested, but is dumped after she realizes she's a lesbian.
-   _Dead of Summer_: The end of the pilot "Patience" first shows that Drew was assigned female at birth, with him removing his shirt to show he has breasts and had on a sports bra underneath. It's then established that he's a trans boy. Before that he had been taken as cisgender. It's Played for Drama though when he and Blair, a cisgender gay boy, have a romance. Blair's displeased at learning Drew is a trans boy, and it aborts their romance. By the end though they're back together and got over this however after Blair's apologized.
-   An episode of _Diagnosis: Murder_ plays this straight (as it were). The victim was a trans woman, and Steve had been flirting with her before she was killed. To the show's credit, the victim was portrayed as a sympathetic character and none of the main characters freaked out about it. In fact, she was killed by her former military buddy because he was squicked, and the murderer is portrayed as a Jerkass.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   At the end of the 1999 Comic Relief Affectionate Parody _Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death_, the Doctor regenerates into Joanna Lumley. His companion and fiancée Emma is disappointed as with him being "Not the man I fell in love with". The Master, on the other hand…
    -   "The End of the World": Lady Cassandra, the self-proclaimed "Last Human," casually mentions at one point that she was born a boy on Earth. Given Cassandra's status as a plastic surgery addict who was at that point nothing more than a face on skin stretched into a frame attached to a Brain in a Jar, though, you have to wonder if all concept of gender had disappeared by her time.
    -   "Spyfall": While talking to O, Graham is surprised to learn that the Thirteenth Doctor's claims about whole-body regeneration and having previously been a man weren't made in jest.
-   Inverted in an episode of _The Drew Carey Show_ where Mr. Wick is challenged to find a crossdresser on the floor. After he looks for a while, Dionne Warwick walks in and Wick declares her a drag queen and grabs the music legend in her crotch. It turns out that it was the real Dionne Warwick much to Wick's embarrassment but she seemed to like being groped by him and remarked about how friendly the store's staff was.
-   _Farscape_: In "The Flax", D'Argo discovers that the scavenger Staanz, who appears to be a rather ugly male, turns out to be, in fact, a female of her species ("considered quite the looker") when Staanz makes an Anguished Declaration of Love to him. Crichton and Aeryn witness this and jokes they should Leave the Two Lovebirds Alone (D'Argo also makes a rapid departure) but afterwards Crichton asks Aeryn to confirm she's the female of her species. Aeryn responds by grabbing his crotch, which he takes as a yes.
-   Korean drama _The First Shop of Coffee Prince_ is actually an odd example. The manager initially thought he was in a gay relationship, and was hesitant for this reason. But since he was trying to avoid arranged marriages and was so shocked to suddenly find this out, even though it was a workable relationship.
-   On _Friends_, Ross reminisces about how he and Chandler once tried to pick up women in a bar. Apparently, he was unsuccessful, while Chandler ended up making out with his conquest. Monica comments that such behavior for Chandler would be highly unusual. Ross agrees that Chandler isn't the type to go to bars and make out with _girls_...
-   In one episode of _House_, a beautiful teenage model appears to be female, but turns out to have Complete Androgen Insensitivity, with her symptoms being caused by a tumor on one of her undeveloped testicles. She is horrified to discover this, as is her manager/father, with whom she had been having sex. House's response to the manager's horror is priceless:
    
    **House:** Oh, sure. _Now_ it's creepy.
    
-   Double Subversion in _The IT Crowd_ when, in a B-plot, Douglas embarks on a successful relationship with a trans woman who insists on coming clean on their first date — but it comes crashing down when he reveals that he wasn't really listening and thought she was saying that she was from Iran, not "I used to be a man."
-   _The Jeffersons_: Twisted in the 1977 episode "Once a Friend" – Louise actually has this when a highly-attractive woman named Edie comes to visit George. George also experiences this when he doesn't immediately recognize Edie... and both are in for quite a shock when they realize Edie was once a man named Eddie (the man George knew during his service in the Navy).
-   A semi-common event on _The Jerry Springer Show_ is a trans woman or man coming out as trans to their boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse. The person being told rarely reacts well, oftentimes because they're angry that they weren't informed sooner, feeling like their partner was lying to them or deliberately hiding information. Given this it's unsurprising that most of these events end with the spouse breaking things off with the transperson, sometimes due to Incompatible Orientation, other times due to no longer feeling like they can trust their partner if they were willing to hide something so major.
    -   Subverted on at least one occasion; a transwoman confessed to her online boyfriend that she used to be male. He looked shocked for a moment before shrugging and saying he'd try anything once. They then locked lips to the audience's amusement.
-   _JAG_: In "Retrial," a sailor had unbeknownst to him hired a transgender prostitute. When finding out, the sailor changed his mind and the prostitute threatens him with a knife. The sailor defends himself and accidentally stabs the prostitute and runs away in fear and shame.
-   _Kamen Rider Double_:
    -   The heroes use Wakana as bait to attract the Liar Dopant. Of course they couldn't really put Wakana in the line of fire. It's Philip in a dress and wig.
    -   Also Akiko is one of the male-seeming bodyguards.
    -   In _Kamen Rider × Kamen Rider Wizard & Fourze: Movie War Ultimatum_, Kamen Rider Wizard meets a beautiful young woman while inside her Underworld<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and they seem attracted to each other; when he gets back to the real world, the young woman is revealed to be the Camp Gay owner of Haruto's favorite donut shop. While there are elements of the trope's pure form (the Owner says "When I was younger, I was often mistaken for a girl"), for Haruto it's more of an Unsettling **Identity** Reveal.
-   In the "Who Can Bone More Women?" Contest on _Kenny vs. Spenny_, Kenny hires a trans woman to get all buddy-buddy with Spenny. Spenny racks up points like crazy until The Big Reveal at the end. He is not happy.
-   In episode "Fallacy" of _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_ involves a transgender woman who appears female in every conceivable way except her plumbing, who apparently killed a friend of her boyfriend's to prevent a public revelation. When the SVU team confront the boyfriend (ignorant of the fact that the boyfriend had no idea his girlfriend is trans), he runs in, grabs her by the groin to determine sex, and then runs out to commit suicide with an overdose of heart condition pills. A judge then decides to send the her to a men's prison because of her plumbing. She is promptly gang-raped and beaten. We are shown the aftermath, with her headed to a hospital, strapped to a gurney, basically a solid swollen bruise.
-   In _Miranda (2009)_, a chap complimenting large-boned Miranda on her dolled-up appearance ("You look amazing. You totally pass!") is thoroughly embarrassed to discover that she _really is_ a woman, and is unwittingly _dressed_ as a transvestite.
-   _Nip/Tuck_:
    -   Matt starts a relationship with an older woman named Ava (played by Famke Janssen), much to the displeasure of his three parents. Christian seduces her in an effort to get her to stay away from Matt and immediately deduces she used to be a man (and later describes her as "the goddamned Hope Diamond of transsexuals").
    -   After Matt finds out about Ava and she has disappeared, he trolls bars until he finds a non-passing trans woman, but as they start making out, Matt discovers she is pre-op and beats her violently.
-   _NCIS_ has a first-season episode "Dead Man Talking". While investigating a missing embezzler, Tony ends up on a date with a woman connected to the missing man. Then learns that she is actually the missing embezzler. Afterward, Kate rarely missed an opportunity to remind Tony of the incident.
-   In the episode of _Quantum Leap_ What Price Gloria, Sam uses this trope to enact revenge on his (female) host's boss for his treatment of her best friend. Sam convinces him that his host, the woman he'd been lusting after all episode, is secretly a man, playing with this trope even though the host has always been a woman.
-   Done for revenge in _Rab C. Nesbitt_ when Mary Nesbitt's sexually abusive boss is tricked into groping David Tennant.
-   Inverted on _Reno 911!_: Dangle once had sex with a woman he mistook for a man in drag.
-   Discussed on _Rupauls Drag Race_ with Courtney Act, one of the few contestants in the entire series who can genuinely pass as a cisgender woman in appearance and voice. She has had sex in drag with men who claimed they didn't care that she was actually a man, but in those two minutes after a man climaxes where he's not thinking about sex, they'd be disgusted with themselves and her.
-   _Tales from the Crypt_: In the episode "The Assassin", a ditzy housewife is imprisoned in her home by three CIA agents looking for her husband, whom they believe is a renegade government assassin. The housewife inadvertently kills the two male agents and grapples with the female one, who spitefully reveals she was lovers with the titular assassin. She's beyond shocked when the housewife gleefully reveals _she herself_ is the assassin, following a sex change (and still able to use her masculine voice).
-   _There's Something About Miriam_ features a sexy lady called Miriam and a group of stud males trying to woo her attention. Except that Miriam is actually Transgender - something the participants had no idea of but which the audience knew right from the start of episode one. The whole thing led to some of the competing men suing the TV network. And as one can imagine, transgender advocates were not thrilled at the show setting the movement back to the stone age.
-   A sexuality-inverted instance occurs in an episode of _3rd Rock from the Sun_, in which a Guy Of The Week dumps Sally when he finds out, to his dismay, that she _isn't_ a guy in drag.
-   One Title Sequence of _Three's Company_ shows Larry getting into the same bumper car at an amusement park with who looks like a long-haired woman from the back. Then the bumper car turns around and the viewers (and Larry) discover that this "woman" has a mustache.
-   _Two and a Half Men_:
    -   Charlie meets an old flame who has had a sex change and became Bill. He is freaked out by it but eventually comes to terms with the idea until his mother starts dating his ex. And Alan's reaction when he starts seeing the similarities in him and Jill is even funnier:
        
        **Alan:** (_sees a picture of Jill_) She's cute. Very tall. Broad shoulders- **HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!!**  
        **Charlie:** Welcome to the Matrix.  
        **Alan:** So, s-s-so Jill is, i-is-  
        **Charlie:** Yep.  
        **Alan:** And, a-a-a-and you and Jill used to-  
        **Charlie:** Every chance we got.  
        **Alan:** A-A-And Mom is-  
        **Charlie:** At this very moment.  
        **Alan:** (_looks at the picture once more_) **HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!!**
        
    -   A Running Gag is a certain Noodle Incident where he hit on a woman who later turned out to be a man. And from such statements it was pretty obvious but Charlie was too drunk to notice at the time.
        
        **Charlie**: How was I supposed to know?"  
        **Alan**: She had an Adam's apple the size of my fist and could palm a basketball.
        
-   Subverted in _Ugly Betty_: Daniel is less freaked out by Alexis being transgender than he is at her being his supposedly-dead brother, _who he'd just been hitting on_.
-   _Will & Grace_: Jack freaks out when he gets turned on by the stripper at Leo's bachelor party, until he finds out the stripper is a trans woman who dances to raise money for her operation.
-   Happens to Herb Tarlek on _WKRP in Cincinnati_ twice (sort of):
    -   In one episode, Herb starts flirting with a woman who claims she knew him in high school. While making out with her, he learns he did know her in high school... before she had the operation. She was a teammate of his on the high school football team, in fact the center to Herb's quarterback. To say Herb had a case of the _Squick_ is putting it mildly.
    -   In an earlier episode, the trope is invoked and subverted by Johnny. To get Herb to stop hitting on Jennifer, he tells Herb "Our receptionist, the beautiful Jennifer Marlowe, is a result of the most cunningly successful sex change operation in the United States!" The ploy works... sort of.
-   The Korean Series _You Are Beautiful_ has a convent novitiate dressing like her twin brother to join a pop band. And the drummer was the last to figure it out...

    Manhua 

-   The protagonist of "Obey Me," Jinyoo, develops a crush on the girl he's imprisoned alongside, Hanya, while they're both held captive by Jinyoo's Yandere captor, Gyuh-Wool. While rifling through some boxes in the room they're trapped in, Jinyoo finds that one of them is full of pads that Gyuh-Wool put there for Hanya in case she got her period, but when Jinyoo shows her, she becomes sullen and says that she _should_ be having her period, but isn't. Jinyoo internally panics, thinking that maybe Gyuh-Wool raped and impregnated her in the two weeks she was alone with him, but she tearfully admits that she's Transgender and was afraid of telling Jinyoo in case he would shun and bully her for it like everyone else. He's distraught at first and calls her names, but quickly apologizes when he realizes that he's in love with her nonetheless.

    Music 

-   One of Aerosmith's '80s comeback singles was "Dude Looks Like A Lady," with a line that goes, "Love put me wise/To her love in disguise/She had the body of a Venus/Lord, imagine my surprise!"
-   In a rare example that has nothing to do with appearance, most people are surprised to learn that Angela Gossow, the vocalist of Swedish band Arch Enemy, is a woman. Why? Well... just listen.
-   From Eminem's Just Lose It:
    
    **Eminem:** Now what's your name, girl? What's your sign?  
    **"Girl":** Man, you must be up out your mind. \*_\[is actually Dr. Dre\]_
    
-   EPMD's "Jane 3" off of _Business As Usual_: It all starts when Erick & Parrish befriend a hard gangsta named Jay... but when they visit "his" pad, the decor (and bathroom contents) don't seem right...
-   The lead singer/guitarist of The Silversun Pickups has a very high register, causing a mild version of this for someone who hasn't seen them perform before.

-   "Luisa" by the Peruvian band _Chabelos_. It's about a guy who falls in love with a hooker called Luisa, and then discovers that "Luisa" is a transvestite, and he thinks that's hot.
-   Being one of the VIPPERloids (a series of troll characters created by 2ch), the UTAU Ritsu Namine was deliberately designed with this trope in mind. See those breasts on his costume? Those aren't pads, they're _missiles_.
-   Most J-Pop stars utilize this trope as a way to gain fans. Notable examples include Miyavi and Gackt (though Gackt is quite competent at expressing his masculinity when need be). The latter was also a major inspiration for many of Tetsuya Nomura's character designs. The Crisis Core character, Genesis Rhapsodos was directly modeled after him.
-   Pet Shop Boys' "One thing leads to another". The protagonist gets drunk, picks up a woman in a bar, attempts to make love to her, and discovers she's has a penis. He drives off, confused, and crashes his car and dies.
-   The Filipino song "Chiksilog" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  by Kamikazee is about a _Ragnarok Online_ player's reaction to finding out the hard way that the "girl" his character hangs out with a lot turns out to be a Cross Player.
-   In Rodney Carrington's appropriately named "I Think I'm Dancing with a Man" the singer begins to get suspicious of the woman he's been dancing with because of many masculine traits. His friend then takes "her" for a dance and "her" skirt falls off confirming it.
-   Schoolly D's "Saturday Night": "What I thought was a girl was nothin' but a fag" (Needless to say he's not gonna win any GLAAD awards either)
-   The second version of "Uneasy Rider", when the singer and his friend go into a gay bar and the friend goes off dancing with a lovely lady.
    
    _I grabbed her hair  
    Came off in my hand  
    And that beautiful girl  
    Was just a beautiful man._
    
    -   Used in this case to show how depraved the homosexuals are in the singer's eyes, and both preceded and followed by gay bashing, since one of the other patrons in the bar did flirt with him.
-   Biz Markie's "A Thing Named Kim": "She didn't look none like she looked across the room/She had big broad shoulders and her titties was big/They were filled with silicone, and her hair was a wig... So I hurried out and left, she said, "Please stay"/I said, "Sorry money grip, I don't go that way"/So I stepped out in a hurry, to gather my wits/And thought _that's a damn shame, he had nice tits_/And that's the last I ever saw of Kim/You wanna know why? Cause she's a he and her's a him." Needless to say, Markie didn't win many GLAAD awards for that one.
-   _The Doug Anthony All Stars_ song Sailor's Arms also has this theme.
-   Tone Lōc's "Funky Cold Medina": "But when she got undressed it was a big ol' mess... Sheena was a MAN!"
-   One of the most famous songs by The Kinks, "Lola", is notable for subverting this trope at a time when that was unheard of (the year 1970). In the song, the narrator is attracted to someone he sees as a woman (with an Ambiguous Gender Identity, either a crossdresser or a trans woman) and after a while he realizes she seems to have been male at birth. While he's confused at first and almost leaves in shock, he changes his mind and decides in the end that he doesn't care and he likes her for who she is, reasoning "Well I'm not the world's most masculine man / But I know what I am". While the song uses a gender reveal as a plot twist, it's not shown as all that unsettling, more like surprising.
-   In Wilfrido Vargas's "Macho Man", a guy falls for a pretty girl that he later finds out, while they are almost intimate, is a pretty boy; he freaks out and runs away, losing his shoes in the process.
-   In Apollo 440's song "Disco Sucks", the singer runs into this at a disco club.
    
    Her heels were so high
    
    Girl was touchin' my eye
    
    She was movin' in time
    
    She was blowin' my mind
    
    She was takin' me there
    
    To my dreams in the sky
    
    It was to my surprise
    
    That the girl was a guy
    

    Music Videos 

-   The music video for the song "Smack My Bitch Up" by The Prodigy does this to the viewer. It's a first person-camera accounting of a night of drunken carousing, drug use, and barhopping in which the protagonist gets into at least one fight with some guy, and molests a girl in a club, ultimately ending the night with a hooker. It's then revealed by a look in the mirror that the protagonist is actually a hot chick herself.
-   Stolen City's video for "Faces" features a man chatting up a girl in a bar. When his friends reveal the girl is transgender, he is _not_ happy.

    Myths & Religion 

-   The Chinese folktale _Butterfly Lovers_ tells a story of a guy and a girl falling in love at an all-boys' school. And since there were only boys' schools back then, the girl had to dress like a boy. It was the moment when she "disguised" as a girl that the guy started to fall in love with her.

    Print Media 

-   Occurred on a huge scale in an issue of _Maximum PC_ with an advertisement. Sufficient numbers of people were surprised that the actor was male, that it was mentioned in the letter from the editor in the next issue. The ad in question featured Toplessness from the Back, but a very effeminate male.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   WWE wrestler Mark Henry ran into this trope years ago. He had a fling with Chyna, who introduced Mark to her friend Sammi. A couple weeks later Mark found out the hard way that Sammi was a transvestite.
    
    "Oh sweet Jesus she has a penis!"
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   The _Eberron_ setting of _Dungeons & Dragons_ actually notes that this possibility of this occurring is one of the main reasons for the Fantastic Racism leveled against the shapeshifting Changeling race, whose members are fully capable of changing not just appearance but gender at will, regardless of the gender of their actual native form. It's a well-known joke in Eberron fan circles to point to any depiction of an attractive male or female character and declare that it's really a changeling of the opposite gender.
    -   Nevermind that picture from the Sharn sourcebook that showed a couple of the working girls in the red-light district. The jokes that picture alone spawned...
-   While technically androgynous in the new fluff, Daemonettes from _Warhammer 40,000_ will play this trope on one of their victims just to watch them squirm. Because, you know, that's what they do. (And then they gut their victims like pigs with their claws, which can go through Powered Armor like a knife through butter.)

    Theatre 

-   This one's Older Than Steam because Shakespeare did it first. Someone falls for the Sweet Polly Oliver in both _Twelfth Night_ and _As You Like It_. In _The Merry Wives of Windsor,_ Master and Mistress Page arrange for the suitors they prefer for their daughter Anne to elope with her (because they both like different ones), but Anne runs off with the man she actually loves and the two rejected suitors end up with cross-dressed boys. (Although it's not uncommon for at least one of them to be played as fairly happy with that, since they're both pretty camp.)
-   The play (and subsequent film) _M. Butterfly_ is about a French diplomat who has an affair with a Chinese opera singer, unaware that she is a) a spy for the Chinese government and b) a man in disguise. This is, believe it or not, a case of Truth in Television: the play is partially based on the life of Bernard Boursicot.
    
    "There are no women in the Chinese Opera."
    
-   This is the plot twist in _Epicene, or the Silent Woman_, by Shakespeare's contemporary Ben Jonson, in which the protagonist persuades his eccentric, noise-hating uncle Morose to marry the title character as part of a plot to secure his inheritance: since he stands to lose it if his uncle marries, his plan is to provide him with a wife he doesn't like and then offer Morose a reason to end the marriage on the condition he gets his inheritance. Which he does by revealing to both the characters and the audience that Epicene has been a boy in disguise all along — which would have been a big surprise to an audience accustomed to seeing female characters played by boys.
-   Inverted in _A Very Potter Sequel_: Dumbledore assumes that Umbridge is actually a man in drag (as she is played by one) and becomes attracted to her, only to find out that she's actually an extremely butch woman.

    Video Games 

-   The Japanese _Animal Crossing_ has this according to Blanca's bio. It translates to: "When I suddenly met her she asked me to please paint her face, it really surprised me! Did her makeup fall off maybe? Huh? She’s a boy?!"
-   In _ANNO: Mutationem_, one side-quest by Ayane asking Ann to search for Noctis City's idol OK-Chan after finding evidence the idol might be in the area. Though, finding the apartment has OK-Chan turned out to be a bulky guy using a virtual move-set. Ayane took it in stride and compliments his incredible moves.
-   While the title heroine of _Atelier Annie_ has her moments due to her (unfortunate) Bifauxnen status, the game also gives a somewhat bizarre example when some men tried to hit on, of all people, _Hans_. The bizarre part is that they genuinely mistook him as a girl, while his co-workers in the Committee see him as a guy just fine.
-   Iita in _Blaze Union_. Oh, ye gods, Iita. She's a perfectly adorable little Fille Fatale, cute and squeaky and very girly. Then night falls, and the other half of her Split Personality takes over — the side that is male, brash, Hot-Blooded, and downright thuggish. Her male half cheerfully announces to the stunned women of the game's cast that "oh right, sorry, I forgot to say: I'm a man at night". Equally shocking to people who first see Iita as a male and then realize that what they thought was a boy dressed in girl's clothes is actually still physically female.
-   _Catherine_:
    -   Erica is actually a trans woman. However, Vincent, Orlando and Jonny are aware of it, and there are several hints dropped over the course of the game before the actual reveal. It's only this trope to Toby, who lost his virginity to her.
    -   In the Updated Re-release, Vincent accidentally discovers that Qatherine/"Rin" is a Wholesome Crossdresser. Vincent's shocked reaction is played for drama; he panics and slaps Qatherine's hand away. While he immediately regrets it, he's unable to apologize in time to prevent Qatherine from running away in tears. If you choose to pursue a relationship with them, Vincent will quickly fix his mistake and eventually realize that Rin is the only one with whom he feels he can truly be himself around. He'll admit that gender doesn't matter him, basically outing himself as bisexual to his friends and the rest of the patrons at The Stray Sheep. Near the end, he even shuts down Mutton's homophobic ranting with a heartfelt Kirk Summation. In the True Ending, it's revealed that Rin is actually from a race of Angelic Aliens whose human form is that of an androgynous male. But by that point, it doesn't matter to Vincent; they get Happily Married and go on a music tour in outer space!
-   Flea from _Chrono Trigger_ has confused generations of gamers with his/her claim that he/she is actually a guy, despite having obvious cleavage in the artwork. Not to mention the actual heroes, of course. Luckily Flea plays no role whatsoever in the story other than to be a Mini-Boss. It's possible that Flea could, however, be FTM or the result of a magical experiment that stuck him in a female body/gave him breasts.
-   _Dark Souls_ has the Dark Sun Gwyndolin, the last born son of the Lord of Sunlight, Gwyn. Because of his lunar magic and association with the moon, he was raised as a girl. _He even has tits._
-   The _Digimon_ series has played with Renamon's gender (or lack thereof) for some time, but _Digimon World Data Squad_ amped it up by giving us a _male_ Renamon with a painfully obvious female voice (in fact, it was the same voice actress who played Renamon in _Tamers_). Let's ignore the Unfortunate Implications of a male Sakuyamon. The German fans must've been laughing hard at that one.
-   _Disgaea_:
    -   This happens to Tink in _Disgaea 2_ when he tries to hit on a Cute Monster Girl after joining your group. Of course, nobody bothered to tell him that the aforementioned "girl" is, in fact, Bridget's Lawyer-Friendly Cameo...
    -   Also happens in _Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero?_. The cute little Incubus is revealed in the hidden Monsterpedia section that "she's" a he.
    -   The Alraune trap is brought back again in _Disgaea 4_ when the Cute Monster Girl in question is revealed as a guy in front of "her" adoring fans. Said fans decide that they "don't mind a little trap action."
-   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, it turns out that Shale was actually once a female dwarf. Thanks to The Fog of Ages, even the character in question is stunned by this, making it a rare case of the _character in question_ experiencing the unsettling reveal.
    -   It's implied that she was aware of the fact beforehand, just considered it, for all intend and purposes, unimportant, since she is, after all, a genderless golem.
-   In _Ensemble Stars!_, Kaoru first encounters Souma at a live music venue, and when he sees his long ponytail, immediately gets excited at the prospect of meeting a 'black-haired Japanese beauty'. He calls out to him, but realises his mistake as soon as Souma starts talking, and tries to back out of the situation immediately out of embarrassment. Souma, however, has no idea why Kaoru approached him and is distinctly offended when Kaoru instantly turns cold to him, but his attempts to figure out what Kaoru wants from him only have him even more flustered and defensive. This, naturally, rather sets their relationship off on the wrong foot. It doesn't help that Souma doesn't approve of Kaoru's womanising in general - or that, even after learning that he's a man, Kaoru still seems to find him beautiful, musing in one conversation that Souma's hair 'really is silky' and that his figure from behind is 'deceptive'.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   _Final Fantasy IV_ has a certain dancer in the town of Fabul.
    -   _Final Fantasy V_. The leader of a band of pirates called Faris is assumed to be a male due to occupation, but once the party gets halfway through the second dungeon it turns out he is a she. To quote a boss later on in the game, _And now we shall fight like men. And women. And women who dress like men._ She even occasionally mistaken refers to herself as male. It's clearer in the original Japanese, where gender is reinforced by speech much more than in English. (For example, Japanese has gender-specific first-person pronouns, not that this stops some people.)
    -   _Final Fantasy VII_: It's possible to get the Don to choose Cloud, in which case he reveals that he was in drag. While the idea of the Don picking Cloud over Tifa and Aerith may seem silly and unlikely based on the graphics in the original game (and their low polygon count), the Don's decision becomes much more understandable if one looks at Cloud's character design in Advent Children, especially if Cloud-in-drag appeared anything like THIS<small>◊</small>. Stupid Sexy Cloud.
    -   _Final Fantasy VII Remake_ makes it clear that Cloud can go _all out_ in looking like a woman, and the confusion on how Don Corneo can choose Cloud over Tifa and Aerith is much clearer.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_: Serra is rather cold to Lucius when she thinks he's a girl in their C support, but when she finds out he's a guy, their B support has her going all starry-eyed.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Awakening_:
        -   In Japan, Sissy Villain Excellus uses female pronouns to the disgust of the other characters. Unsurprisingly the localizers removed this.
        -   Averted with Lucius's expy Libra. He mentions after being called a sister by Chrom that he's actually a priest. When he apologizes, he mentions that it could have been awkward. Very awkward. Very Very awkward. Unsurprisingly, Chrom tells him to stop. ("God give me strength. _Even the Queen's brother confused me for a woman_.")
        -   Things indeed become funny and awkward in Libra's supports with Virion, who continues to flatter his beauty even _after_ finding out he's a man.
        -   And he's also mistaken as a woman _by at least one potential girlfriend/wife_. See his C support with Sully... who, ironically, is one of _the_ tomboys of the cast.
        -   And in Libra's solo ending, it's explicitly said that he both built an Orphanage of Love and was asked out by both guys and girls.
        -   It might be a trap for players to trap players who are expecting a "trap", but there is a masked young man who claims to be Marth and backs it up by wielding Marth's legendary sword, the Falchion. People are already very aware of Marth's gender at this point, right...? Turns out, this "Marth" is an imposter... and a girl. Yeah. Marth is a Girl, and a very beautiful one too.) (You may now Squee). In fact, according to the promotional manga, in-story this took place sooner than we thought... Remember that Lon'qu was defeated by "Marth"? One of the reasons is that, during their fight, Lon'qu accidentally bumped head-first into Marth's chest and realised that his opponent was a woman. Since Lon'qu has a _bad_ case of gynophobia due to his Dark and Troubled Past, well...
-   Unsurprisingly, the Camwhore class in _Forum Warz_ has this as a standard attack, if one not often seen. (It's down the line of a skill chain which many players respec out of before obtaining it.) Note that the gender, age and race of _every_ player character is defined as "whatever happens to be squickiest at this instant". The same applies to any NPCs who use multiple or artificial personas, eliminating any potential shock value out of gender. (Especially as very few players would be attracted to most of the NPCs.)
-   _Guilty Gear_: Bridget, the former Trope Namer, is introduced in _XX_ as a crossdressing boy in a nun habit. She was born as the younger of two male twins, but as her hometown had a superstitious belief that male twins would bring disaster (and should be put to death or exiled), Bridget was secretly raised as a girl. Her birth gender is never a secret to the audience, as it's told at the beginning of her storyline, nor does she try to hide it from anyone and corrects them in casual conversation if they call her a girl. The problem is that most other characters simply _assume_ she's a cis woman, due to her behavior, Moe nun outfit, and way of speaking<sup>Note&nbsp;</sup> , and they act on her before finding out the truth.
    -   As seen on the page image, one of her story mode endings involves Johnny trying to flirt with her, only to discover her gender mid-fight and feeling humiliated ("I can't believe I just tried to seduce another man...").
    -   In Zappa's win quote, he writes a letter to his mom (which he does during his brief periods of lucidity), saying he found an injured young girl by the side of the road whom he wished to make his wife. But when he attempted to pick her up and carry her...
    -   In his win quote, resident Lovable Sex Maniac Robo-Ky asserts that he wasn't fooled by her, except he admits that he found out by using his See-Thru Specs on her.
    -   Not to mention a little Yon Koma about Axl trying to hit on Bridget. Bridget gets fed up, grabs his arm and pulls it below the panel, with the word "TOUCH♡". The final panel has Axl gripping said hand with a horrified expression, going "What the hell did I just touch?". And "DESTROYED" in large letters above him, referencing the One-Hit Kill attacks from the games.
    -   In Real Life, people have found it quite amusing to show Bridget to those who aren't familiar with the Guilty Gear series and get their reactions when they drop the bombshell. "Everyone is gay for Bridget" quickly became an infamous meme and her defining character trait outside of universe.
    -   The trope is deconstructed in _Guilty Gear -STRIVE-_. During the in-universe six-year gap between _XX_ and _\-STRIVE-_, Bridget had succeeded as a bounty hunter, proving her village superstition bunk and allowing her to live openly as a man. However, doing so triggers her gender dysphoria, which she hides from her family. When mistaken for a girl by Goldlewis, she's more hesitant to correct him than before. Both Goldlewis and Ky recognize what's going on, and they give her the space to talk it out while gently encourage her to be true to herself. This finally gives Bridget to stop running from her feelings and come out as a transgender woman.
-   In _BlazBlue_, if you pit Bang Shishigami against Noel Vermillion in _Continuum Shift_, he mistakes her for "a young man" despite her rather girlish clothing including a short skirt. Noel will believe it's because of her lack of boobage and GET PISSED OFF.
    -   Amane Nishiki makes that mistake in Arcade Mode, too. He comments how Noel would be perfect playing the roles of women (never mind Noel is a girl) with the kind of crossdressing she's wearing at the time.
    -   Dpeaking of _BlazBlue_, Kagura Mutsuki has a match intro where he scans the female anatomy, complete with targeting reticules and readouts. He does this with Amane Nishiki as well, and expresses disappointment at the obvious. For Fridge Brilliance, Kagura's exact quote is "Not another dude...", which means he's already experienced this trope _a lot_ and Amane wasn't his first case.
-   In _The Legend of Heroes: Trails to Azure_, the SSS are shocked to discover the presumed-male assassin Yin is actually female, and even more surprised to discover she's actually Rixia Mao.
-   And for the most famous female example, you have Sheik of _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_. Earlier in the game, Ruto called "him" a man. She was wrong. You know that you have an epic gender reveal when the fandom spends _ten years_ starting Flame Wars over it.
-   _Leisure Suit Larry_ has this happen twice:
    -   _Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out!_: The dark-skinned makeup artist Shablee turns out to be a cross-dresser/transvestite (according to documentation/development notes), still sporting a sizable phallus. As Larry learns the truth only after some passionate kissing, his immediate after-the-reveal reaction is to recoil and start spitting and gagging. The next morning's shot shows him in his room rinsing furiously.
    -   _Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude_: Koko the troubled mime turns out to be a trans woman sporting a package that's large enough to make an audible \*THUD\* upon opening her fly. This revelation is enough to put Larry into the fetal position. The model viewer shows her equipment, but it's tiny enough to conform to her feminine character model... Must be a grow-er, not a show-er.
-   In _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_, Raiden, a shameless Bishōnen, is revealed to the President of the United States. The president literally grabs Raiden's package to check his sex, reacting in suppressed shock when he learns the terrible truth — the script says he'd misidentified him as the similar-looking female terrorist leader, Olga Gurlukovich, but Raiden's decidedly male voice and obvious bulge should have put that suspicion out the window. Besides, why didn't he just ask Raiden?... What was he planning to do to Olga?! _Who voted for that?!_
    -   According to an in-character Quinton Flynn, "Why would I even care? I'm not even anatomically correct! I run around naked and I got no junk!" ...That might say something...
-   _NieR_ has an unusual version of this in that one of the main characters, Kainé, is revealed to be a hermaphrodite. This is done very subtly in-game, so a lot of people might have ended up not realizing it if that piece of information hadn't been leaked somehow before the game even came out.
-   _Persona_:
    -   _Persona 3_ has the more basic Played for Laughs version of the trope during "Operation Babe Hunt."
    -   In _Persona 4_, exactly how Unsettling Naoto's Gender Reveal is to Kanji is a vital piece of the latter's characterization. Kanji, who can be interpreted as struggling with very deep sexual identity issues, textually expresses almost the exact same mixture of anxiety and eagerness in interactions with Naoto before and after the scene in question. Perhaps most tellingly, though, Kanji is at his most resolute when Naoto's life is in imminent danger of Shadow\-fueled destruction, only moments after the Reveal itself.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   One of the Ferris Wheel date options for the male player character in the Japanese version of _Pokémon Black 2 and White 2_ is a schoolteacher who, mid-ride, takes off his shirt in the heat and admits he had to pose as a woman to get the job. This is censored in most translations.
    -   Gothorita mentions in _Pokepark 2 Wonders Beyond_ that many Pokemon mistake him for a girl.
-   _Ratchet & Clank_:
    -   The thief in _Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando_ is revealed to be a girl, upon which Ratchet comments "Whoah! He's... a she!"
    -   Happens to Clank in _Up Your Arsenal_, in which the duo find a video of Qwark Disguised in Drag. Clank's first thought is "What? That Qwark had a sister?"
-   In _Sakura Wars 2: Thou Shalt Not Die_, Ichiro Ogami goes to take a bath in the hot springs during the Flower Division's vacation. When he sees Leni Milchstraße in the bath, it turns out that the latter is not a guy, but a girl. Cue an Oh, Crap! when Leni makes him aware of this.
-   Elh from _Solatorobo_ talks and acts like a boy, but is revealed to be a girl when Red walks in on her bath.
-   _Summertime Saga_ has the shy Eve, who is reticent about undressing in front of the Main character. This is more of an aversion: one reason for her reticence is that she has a disfiguring scar from a motorbike crash. The other is that she is really a he with a willy, or what the Japanese call a futunara. If you choose for her to have a bulge, the player character will be quick to accept it.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_, this happens with Chihiro. Since this happens after he is murdered, it becomes even more unsettling.
-   _Fate Series_:
    -   In _Fate/stay night_, there's a reason why Guinevere had that affair with Lancelot, since her husband, King Arthur, aka Saber, turns out to be a woman (and stopped aging at the age of 15), but Guinevere agreed to the marriage as political fiction only, and due to that reason Arthuria never blamed Guinevere nor Lancelot for their romance and was forced to take action against it by her enemies.
    -   This also occurs in the _stay night_ prequel series _Fate/Zero_, where Kiritsugu is quite shocked when he summons King Arthur and finds himself face to face with a young woman. While Saber initially thinks that it's because he's displeased by her sex, Kiritsugu's wife Irisviel explains to her that it's more that he's saddened because he realizes what Saber was forced to go through, including hiding her identity.
    -   _Fate/Apocrypha_ has Astolfo, who is so effeminate that at least Sieg and Jeanne thought he was a girl. Then Astolfo came out of the shower with no towel around his waist... granted, only Jeanne actually freaked out in embarrassed shock, while Sieg isn't really affected by such sights due to his emotional development.
    -   However, in _Fate/Grand Order_, male heroes turning out to have been women in disguise all along (or openly female from the start) is an Unusually Uninteresting Sight to the protagonist.
-   Shika in _Kira☆Kira_, when a guy fell in love with him when he was forced to cross dress. Two years later, he was shocked to realize that Shika was in fact male, but quickly got over it even offering to _be his wife_ since the idea seemed to make him uncomfortable.
-   Robin Newman in _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Dual Destinies_. It catches EVERYONE in court off guard, including the usually stoic Simon Blackquill.
-   _Steins;Gate_:
    -   Invoked and parodied by the narration when Ruka is introduced. Without prior knowledge of the character, you _will_ assume they're a girl (the Miko outfit doesn't help), but Rintaro will eventually start making complementary remarks in narration "More feminine than any woman alive..." only to end them with "...But, he's a guy!".
    -   Kurisu also appears quite disturbed the first time Rintaro corrects her when she talks about how nice Mayuri's 'female' friend was.
    -   In-universe example for Rintaro after Ruka manages to change her sex to female (at birth) using D-Mail. The fact that she looks exactly the same either way doesn't help matters. Arguably, it's just as unsettling for Ruka herself, as Rintaro tries to grab 'his' area to prove 'his' gender.
    -   Much later, Ruka receives one of these for herself, when she comes to remember parts of another world line where she was a he.
-   In _Togainu no Chi_, one of the main characters is Rin, who has a rather fair-looking and youthful appearance that both Akira and Keisuke even mistake him to be a girl until he cheerfully announces, "Sorry to break it to you, but I'm _packing_~"

    Web Animation 

-   This joke was done as a gag during a scene where Hal is trying hit on women in episode 6 of _Bowser's Kingdom_.

-   Unsettling in-universe for Carl from _Llamas with Hats_ to learn that his roommate, who had been unidentified prior to that point, was a male named Paul (in Carl's defense, Paul's hat is rather feminine, but he couldn't even remember Paul's name after three years). After asking Paul if he's sure, which Paul confirms to his annoyance, Carl then says he has to go delete some pictures from his computer.

    Webcomics 

-   Alucard pulls this off as Girlycard in _And Shine Heaven Now_. Granted, the person he fooled is Bertie Wooster... And then many years later did it to Maggie Mui...
-   A blatantly explicit one is seen in _Moon Over June_ when Hatsuki (a highly promiscuous lesbian) barely makes it to the parking lot before she had that evening's hookup's head between her legs. When she went to return the favor....
    
    "You picked me up in a transvestite bar! I thought you knew!"  
    "I just _had_ to go someplace new didn't I?"
    
    -   While Hatsuki's roommate/lover/eventual spouse Summer does not get nearly that far (aside from that incident in Amsterdam), she has on several occasions seen someone from the back and started flirting before he turned around. Given her misandrist tendencies her shock and mortification is invariably Played for Laughs.
-   _Concession_: Artie wakes up to discover he has engaged in inappropriate acts with hypersexual preteen Chelsie Warner while in a brain-tumour-induced — or, as it turned out, Joel-induced — trance, and confides in his boss:
    
    **Artie:** But honestly, I'm not sure what disturbs me more... the fact that this happened, or the fact that Chelsie is actually a **boy.**
    
-   _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_:
    -   Dan infiltrates Twink Territories dressed as a woman. Later on, Biggs finds out. Quoth Biggs: "I'd probably feel more awkward if this was the first time this had happened..."
    -   Later on it turns out Biggs was mostly playing this for laughs, as he's actually one of Dan's childhood friends, just transmasc (and very much more secure in himself than he used to be), so Dan didn't recognize him. Being a Walking Shirtless Scene probably helped too.
    -   In another story arc, the shapeshifting incubus Abel takes a job working at the Lost Lake Inn. Dan gripes that it'll be an unfortunate adventurer who comes into an inn hoping for the traditional greeting and service by a perky cute beer wench. Abel: "Oh, well if THAT's your only issue..." Dan \*turns around to see Abel has put on a very convincing female form\* "YIGG!" Page caption: "Don't worry, adventurers are used to dealing with traps."
    -   Later on Dan meets Mink, who is androgynously pretty, flat-chested, and runs around in a skirt and no shirt. Dan outright asks Mink whether they are a boy or a girl, only to find that Mink has forgotten hirself (being another shapeshifting 'cubi). Mink is on the point of taking a peak down hir skirt to refresh hir memory when Dan decides that he doesn't really need to know that badly. (In an omake, the doctor delivering Mink at hir birth never gets to say.)
-   In _Darths & Droids_, this trope is used wonderfully with The Reveal. In this universe, Darth Vader is actually Padme Amidala, not Anakin Skywalker. When this bombshell was dropped during the RPing of _The Empire Strikes Back_, it totally waylays the entire team, who demand how this was possible.
-   Doubled up in the now defunct comic _Roomies_ with Corey and Dave(ina), they were both posing as men so their boss and co-workers in IT would take them seriously when they went on a date and revealed to one another that they were actually women. They started sleeping together anyways.
-   _Ghastly's Ghastly Comic_:
    -   A rather ridiculous case when the two similar-looking characters in the rather ambiguous fighting game (within a webcomic) "_Loli vs. Shota_", both finally decide to actually check their genders... and are shocked to find out that they're both _wrong_ on which one they thought they were. And yet even though we learn they're both wrong, the reader still is left in the dark about which character is which gender.
    -   A Running Gag is that masculine characters tend to have sex with Freddy... who, despite having breasts, is male and revels in it. They tend to be very drunk at the time.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, this happens quite a lot when someone's stepped out of their normal gender. Somewhat unusually, it often gets milked for some drama in the process.
    -   Justin and Susan almost do something they'd regret later while both gender-bent for Grace's birthday party. Good thing they didn't, since Justin likes _guys_; things would have gotten awkward once Susan became a woman again.
    -   The "Sister" arc was _full_ of this. Minor characters were falling at Elliot's feet, and that's _before_ Ellen took on a life of her own.
-   _Two Sides_ is a Downplayed example as Damian thought he was going out on a date with a girl he saved from a groper on the train before "Heily/Haley" cautiously interrupts their kiss by admitting that that she's actually his classmate, Sebastian, who's been prostituting in drag himself to pay the bills and sadly expects Damian to never want to see him again. While Damian _does_ have a minor Freak Out in processing this, he declares, "I don't care who you are... I like you", lays on The Big Damn Kiss and they go to a hotel to consummate their newfound relationship and after dealing with a blackmailer, live happily ever after. Ironically, this is the _only_ time this happens in the entire comic as either people deliberately seek out that type of prostitute or just don't care such as a groper that go from feeling up his ass to jerking him off without missing a beat. Even a client that met "Heily/Haley" in the street without advertising as such yet wasn't surprised at what was under the skirt and was happily serviced without issue.
-   It was apparently a common occurrence for the flat-chested namesake of _Shayla The Pink Mouse_ to be unknowingly picked up by gay men who thought she was a man until they got her to bed.
-   _Jet Dream:_
    -   Averted by the Elle-Boys of J.E.T. T.E.E.N. Despite looking exactly like girls, they make no secret of the fact that they're actually boys. As a rule, they're also heterosexuals who exhibit many "traditionally masculine" traits.
    -   In the story "South Pacific Powder-Puff Power!"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , there's a startling revelation about a longstanding character. The T-Girls learned that Ting, the Polynesian princess and only "female" member of the Thunderbirds, had actually always been a male. In Ting's matriarchal tribe, male royals are expected to live as women. When the rest of the team changed sex, so did Ting.
-   _Kevin & Kell_:
    -   Reversed when it looks like Rachel (a rhinoceros) might be trying to romance Bruno (an herbivorous wolf)... until she realizes he's a boy. Rachel, as it turns out, is gay. Bruno was wearing a fake sheepskin covered with his girlfriend Corrie's wool, thus making him smell like a girl sheep and giving a species with poor eyesight no other cues to his actual gender. Bruno attaches ram horns to the sheepskin to prevent this from recurring.
    -   Comes back again when Wendell (male rabbit) finds out Jess (female cow) is a girl. Jess has horns, but a lot of people don't realize both genders of cattle have horns.
        
        **Jess:** What part of "cow" don't you understand?
        
-   The big reveal in chapter one of _Lavender Legend_ is that Felicia, the tall and dour maid in the employ of Princess Lavender (and also La Résistance), is actually male, but was raised as a female by his mother in order to keep him from being conscripted into the kingdom's ruinous war that also killed his father. That doesn't stop Princess Lavender from enjoying their earlier first kiss... or from constantly tempting Felicia with sleeping in her bed.
-   One _Manly Guys Doing Manly Things_ comic has Jared unsettled and warning Commander Badass that Poison was, in his words 'a dude'. Commander Badass then points out that it shouldn't matter what a person has in their pants unless you're planning to get into them. He's more surprised that Jared thought he had a chance to score with Poison, gender aside.
    
    "Y'got an enviable sense'a self esteem, kid. I ain't gonna disrespect that."
    

-   Used in _MegaTokyo_ early on, when Piro is reading through a section of girl's manga in a shop in Japan. A Japanese schoolgirl seems to think that Piro is a girl and is "cute". Her friend informs her that Piro is, in fact, a guy.
-   _Oglaf_':
    -   Super-tease Mistertique enters a room full of ladies, one of whom challenges him to solve her "puzzle vagina", then lifts her skirt to reveal a penis. Mistertique doesn't actually seem to realize it isn't a vagina, or that the person it's attached to isn't a lady.
    -   A knight rushes to rescue a princess chained to a wall and about to be eaten by a salamander. The 'princess' is not actually a princess. The knight opts not to save him, and so the salamander eats him. Judging by the knight's conversation with his squire, this is a common occurance.
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   Averted very carefully by Vaarsuvius, an elf whose gender remains unspecified (and just to keep the readers guessing, the gender of V's lawfully wedded spouse is also unspecified and their kids are adopted.) The Giant revealed at one point that V hadn't told him their gender as anything but "genderqueer" and that V honestly does not care enough about the subject to worry about it.
    -   Invoked when Belkar hits on a magically gender-swapped Roy. Turns out, he knew it was Roy the whole time, and he was just doing it to squick him out.
-   Happens to Pintsize in _Questionable Content_ when he learns that the AnthroPC with whom he's been chatting with is actually a male AnthroPC whose online icon happens to be pink his shock at learning this angers the AnthroPC and he leaves. Pintsize appears to get over it fairly quickly and attempts to continue his relationship with the AnthroPC but at that point, the damage had already been done.
-   _Rain (2010)_:
    -   Gavin is rather shocked that the cute girl Rain is his childhood friend, formerly known as Ryan. He gets over it eventually.
    -   Aiken is very angry when he finds out his fiancée Jessica is transgender, and breaks up the engagement. It doesn't help that she told him only because she knew she wouldn't be able to hide the truth any more. He calms down, but doesn't seem to really get over it. And then he finds out about Rain.
    -   Ana once had an ex-boyfriend who attacked her when he found she’s intersex.
-   Discussed in this MOLEBASHED comic. Wes talks to his wife about reading a book in which characters live their lives in virtual reality. (The book is unnamed in the strip, but in the accompanying post, he confirms that he's talking about Ready Player One.)
    
    **Wes:** What if **we** are the computer-game-avatars for people in the "real world?" What if, in reality, I'm a seventy-year-old cat hoarder who smokes two packs a day?
    
    **Kari:** What if I'm a dude?
    
-   _Scandinavia and the World_:
    
    -   Averted. Denmark asks Thailand if he could buy 'the sexy lady' a cocktail, but Thailand admits he's _Brother_ Thailand, not Sister Thailand. Denmark thinks about it for a Beat, then asks if he'd rather have a beer.
    
    -   And in another strip we have Sister France hitting on Sister Denmark (she thought that it's a handsome long-haired guy). And when they get to the action...
    
    **Sister France:** Where did those breasts come from?! And where is the penis?!  
    **Sister Denmark:** ...I don't know.  
    **Sister France:** I WANTED PENIS!!!
    
-   _Sexy Losers_ loves playing with this trope. Most notable is one comic in which a man picks up a woman with short hair at a bar, only to take her home and discover she is a woman, but he's gay and he thought he was hitting on a man to begin with.
    -   Would that be a booby trap?
    -   Another Sexy Losers strip has one guy get a pregnancy scare from his girlfriend ("I'm not on the pill"), only for her to reveal she used to be a man.
    -   Another has a man approach a suicidal woman whom he asks for a BJ before she jumps. After the act, he asks why she was going to jump. Turns out her parents disowned him for dressing up like a woman. So the guy jumps before the cross-dresser does.
        -   This was later revealed to be jumping to conclusions in a guest comic that both of her parents are crossdressers who are angry that their daughter isn't.
    -   And a final one has a subway groper realize this. It ends up with the "and that's how you were born" Running Gag.
-   In the "Railway Children" arc of _Skin Horse_, Violet Bee tries to invoke this trope by revealing his gender to Tip. This plan falls flat because A) Tip was never particularly attracted to Violet and B) Tip is an Extreme Omnisexual.
-   In this strip of _Sluggy Freelance_, Riff and Torg run into First Officer Brenas, a shapely woman who is actually the male of the species. Riff and Torg subvert the trope by not being bothered at all.
    
    **Torg:** Aw, you think what you want.  
    **Riff:** Can you jump up and down for us, mister?
    
-   A double inversion of this trope occurs in _Teh Gladiators_, first when the Murlocs that join the heroes turn out to actually be female, and then when one of them, Yolanda, develops a crush on Vallant rather than vice versa.
-   _Venus Envy_ has this happen to Lisa when she assumes that Chris is a transgender woman only to discover that he's actually just a Wholesome Crossdresser. Chris gets experiences this trope when he first meets Lisa and Zoe, assumes they're crossdressing boys as well, and grabs Lisa's breast while telling her it "looks totally fake". They beat him up.

-   _The Wotch_ manages to do this to _both_ participants, here when Jason is transformed into Satyr Sonja he has random flirty outbursts he can't control. When he "puts the moves" on Robin they both freak out. Jason continues to flirt-and-freak throughout the arc. And one flirt-and-freak recipient winds up wanting to date "Sonja" later.

    Web Original 

-   _The Awkward Compilation_: _Awkward 4_ has a flashback sequence of a series of Alex's ill-fated blind dates, one of whom is a man who stammers "Alex" in shock and quickly checks to confirm that, yep, that's an adam's apple before running for dear life.
-   A CalebCity video had him trying for a baby with a girl, only for it to not work no matter how many times he tried. When he takes her to the hospital to find out what's wrong, _that's_ when he finds out that she's actually a dude.
-   Fairly common in the _Chakona Space_ setting considering how many characters are Hermaphrodites. Perhaps the most notable example being when Garrek and Chakat Goldfur first started seeing each other and he spotted hir male parts and freaked. Though Garrek later apologized, saying he should have looked up Chakats on the net and realized that they were herms, and they got back together, so far they've got two cubs by one another.
-   In the The Cinema Snob review of _Sadomania_, he repeatedly remarks how beautiful the female warden is and checks the back of the box to find out her name...and discovers she is played by "the stunning transsexual adult film star Ajita Wilson". Cue a horrified "Oh my God" followed by a Smash Cut of him sitting in the shower fully clothed calling Jillian on the phone claiming that they have to have sex "right NOW" since he's "so confused". According to the video description, this was based on a friend of Brad's having had the same revelation.
-   _DesuDesBrigade_: Professor Otaku admits in his Quick Hits review of _Gravitation_ that he didn't realize Shuichi was male until he was halfway through an internet porn search of "her".
    
    **Prof. Otaku:** Well... wow, she really likes it in the butt. Hmm... Why does she... _Oh._
    
-   In _The Key of Awesome_'s parody of Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe," Carly meets a cute guy at the club. The two of them get drunk, then go to Carly's house and make out. The next morning, the guy wakes to find that Carly is actually a madman dressed as a young woman.
-   Discussed in an episode of _Needs More Gay_, where Rantasmo points out how _hugely problematic_ it is that the vast majority of trans representation in media (which isn't very large to begin with), falls under this trope. Especially when the reaction of many male characters to discovering the girl they liked is actually trans is to throw up.

-   In _Vaguely Recalling JoJo_, Nena isn't a fat woman wearing the skin of another woman. Instead, Nena is a boy pretending to be a girl. Polnareff is shocked when he finds out.
-   On the adoptable petsite Valenth, one of the NPCs is the person of intelligible gender of the week, Elliot Christoph. Considering many of the humanoid NPCs are like this, and all of them as such are men (plus the masculine name), many of the users expected Elliot to end up being male, referring to her as Sir Christoph and such. Elliot later is referred to as being female about twenty pages into the thread. The real kicker was the fact that she never bothered correcting them once. Lady looks like a dude indeed.
-   Common for Phase in _Whateley Universe_, as he is an intersexed mutant whose body is mostly female (and extremely gorgeous) but who retains his original male gentalia, gender identity and sexual orientation. Unfortunately, more than a few males can't see past his appearance, and some (such as Imperious, who as the reincarnation of Zeus never gave much of a damn about the sex of his partners anyway) are actually _more_ interested in him knowing that he's a 'she-male'.
    -   Averted with Mega-Girl and Stronghold. When Mega-Girl reveals that she's both transgender and a Gender Bender (but still mostly male for the time being because of the slow manner in which she is changing), Stronghold answered that he loved her anyway.
    -   Zig-zagged for Absinthe and Flytrap; Collin had been a bully to Adam, but they didn't know each other very well beyond that. When Gwen (formerly Adam) meets Collin again after she is 'rescued' by the Mutant Supremacist cell who were trying to recruit Collin, she let's Collin assume that she is Adam's sister. Later, on the trip out to Whateley, they hit it off as friends, and during the first month of school they quickly start feeling romantically towards each other - until Collin finds out that Gwen _was_ Adam. Collin flips out, not because of the gender issue (well, not entirely) but because he thought she actually was just Adam using an illusion to trick and humiliate him. When she finally explains that she was a Gender Bender due to her mutation, he stops being quite as angry, but still feels betrayed because she wasn't upfront about it. They do eventually get back together, though.
    -   For 2006 Transgender Day of Remembrance, the changeling students gather in private to memorialize the deaths of several transgender Whateley students and adult superheroes, most of which involve this.
-   Zigzagged in the Dead West Porcelain Doctor; the narrator, a journalist named Gervas meets the titular porcelain doctor on a steamship, and concludes that the waifish, slim redhead with the creamy skin and the narrow waist ("like wearing a corset") and soft voice, wearing dainty glasses must be a crossdressing woman. He swores to protect the doctor, who is quite baffled, but accepts... then later, on a train, after a clash with "shamblers", the doctor disrobes a bit. Our narrator promptly tries to look away, but peeks a little, and takes a Double Take. The doctor was, in fact, a he. Not that this stops Gervas. Even better, almost everybody mistakes him for a girl. Carolina even grabbed his loins (cue minor freakout, from both parties), and wasn't too sure even after that!
-   During the eighth part of WorstPremadeEver's Sea Of Thieves funny moments, Alex ends up getting stuck on a tree via bugs causing Ellis and Jake to try and get him out, during their attempts Ellis ends up finding out that Alex's character is a woman<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , much to Jake's amusement. In Ellis' own words...
    
    **Ellis**: All I can see is lumps of lard and a shit beard!
    
    -   This happens again in a blooper reel the gang released for their Ballad of Chesty<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  music video though not to the the same extent where Jake, Gabby, Nick and Alex end up finding out that Ellis' own character is female<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , but it took them so long to realise it that Ellis himself forgot that his character is a woman by the time they do.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Amazing World of Gumball_:
    -   In "The Coach", when it was revealed that Coach Russo was the mother of Jamie, the main characters aren't surprised about that, but that Russo (a big, red block with a masculine voice) is a woman.
    -   Subverted in "The Fraud". After Principal Brown reveals that his diploma is fake, the other teachers proceed to reveal some secrets about them. Coach Russo proceeds to reveal: "And I am not a woman..." (Beat, everyone stares at her) "...who can say she's never lied on her résumé either."
-   _Atomic Betty_: At the end of the "No Business Like Snow Business" Betty gets on the boys' hockey team, unbeknownst to Penelope and her friends who swoon over "him" from the stands. Then Betty takes her helmet off. Penelope storms off angrily while her friends just laugh it off.
-   The _Batman Beyond_ episode "Out of the Past" sees Ra's al Ghul transferring his mind into his daughter Talia's body... and Bruce Wayne has quite the history with her (well, as much as he does with anyone). What transpires thoroughly creeps both Bruce and Terry out.
    
    **Ra:** I did not mean for you to find out this way. But I suppose what's done is done... DETECTIVE!
    
    -   And then later:
        
        **Terry:** Lady, that is the _sickest_ thing I've ever seen! You're creeping me out!  
        **Bruce:** You?! She _kissed_ me!
        
    -   Note that this is _Batman_ saying this, and considering his career (which he is more-or-less retired from at this point), it should say a lot.
-   _Beavis and Butt-Head_ watch a Ru Paul video:
    
    **Beavis**: Hey, Butt-head, that chick is pretty hot!  
    **Butt-head**: Uhhh, ya think so?  
    **Beavis**: Yeah, I'd do her in a minute!  
    **Butt-head**: Huh huh, that's a _guy_, Beavis! Huh, huh, you wanna make out with a guy!  
    **Beavis**: SHUT UP, BUTT-HEAD!
    
-   In _CatDog_ no one seemed to realize that Shriek was a girl, not even her fellow Greaser Dogs. Everyone was horrified when they found out, mainly due to them not recognizing her, and finding her quite attractive when she wore a dress.
-   _The Cleveland Show_ has a moment in the Thanksgiving special wherein Cleveland gets revenge on his wayward and emotionally abusive father by not telling him that the "woman" he's about to get in bed with is actually a man (and totally _not_ Tyler Perry / Madea). As it happens, the "woman" in question is actually Uncle Kevin, who disguised himself as a woman so Donna would have a positive female role model after her mother abandoned her. And then when Cleveland DOES tell him, it's not heard, but you see the two men gesturing... then just like Brian Griffin in the above example, the dad vomits for thirty seconds.
-   Near the end of the _Danny Phantom_ episode "One of a Kind", he discovers up close that the rare purple-back gorilla "Samson" is actually a "Delilah". This is his initial reaction. His second is to let people know so that she can get a proper mate, and hopefully save the species.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   In "To Love and Die in Dixie", Chris spends the episode making friends with a new Alabamian neighbor named Sam, but by the third act, he realizes Sam is actually a girl (who wasn't even trying to mislead Chris, she's just fairly androgynous and Chris didn't catch on). The "unsettled" part comes not from sexual squick, but rather because Chris in general gets very nervous when talking to girls, and thus he takes a while to build up the confidence to speak to her again.
    -   In one episode, Peter and the guys are sitting around drinking and talking about who they would sleep with if they could have any woman in the world. Quagmire says Taylor Hanson.
        
        **Joe:** Taylor Hanson's a guy.  
        **Quagmire:** Oh! Oh! Y-you guys are yanking me. "Hey, hey, let's put one over on old Quagmire."  
        **Peter:** No, he's actually a guy, Quagmire.  
        **Quagmire:** W-well, this is insane! That's impossible! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I can't... Oh, God! I-oh, I got all these magazines. Oh G-oh God! Oh, God!
        
    -   Quagmire tends to get this trope fairly often. In one episode, Brian gets a job as a drug-sniffing dog for the police. He demonstrates his skill to Quagmire, who just got off a plane from Manila, by sniffing him and correctly guessing everything he did within the past day or so.
        
        **Brian:** And you had sex with two Filipino women. _\[sniffs again\]_ And a man.  
        **Quagmire:** You mean _three_ Filipino women!  
        **Brian:** _\[Disapproving Look\]_  
        **Quagmire:** ..._**Noooooo!**_
        
    -   In a similar vein, Brian, on the way home from a convention, goes to a hotel bar, meets up with a woman (who the audience knows the identity of), and they intellectually hit it off. After quite a few drinks he goes back to her room, and the next day is telling Stewie about his conquest...only to find that the woman he was with had all the correct parts _now_, but just a couple days ago was Quagmire's _father_; the main plot of the episode is the man going through a sex change operation and how everyone around was dealing with it.
-   _Futurama_:
    
    -   There is the Valentine's Day episode in which Zapp Brannigan is on a blind date with a very burly man in drag, who leaves unexpectedly early...
    
    **Zapp Brannigan:** Honey! Wait! You didn't show me your surprise!
    
    -   Inverted in "War is the H-Word," when Zapp finds himself attracted to "Lee Lemon." He is quite relieved when he finds out it was Leela all along.
    
    **Zapp Brannigan:** Leela! So it's you I've been attracted to! Oh, God, I've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman.
    
    **Leela:** Let's do it again sometime.
    
    -   Also played with in Lrr (ruler of Omicron Persei 8)'s date with what he believes to be an Omicronian woman, who turns out to be a (human) cross-species dresser with a fetish for aliens. He feels shocked and violated.
    -   "In "Fry and the Slurm Factory" While messing with the Professor's F-Ray, Bender sees a smoking hot fembot whom he promptly scans to see her internal anatomy. When she turns out to be transgender (with only one more upgrade to go before completing transition), he reacts in disgust.
-   _High Guardian Spice_: Cal flirts with Snapdragon when Snap is Disguised in Drag for Halloween. When Cal realizes it's Snapdragon under the costume, he gets angry and unsettled and Amaryllis has to stand up for Snap.
-   In the _Johnny Bravo_ episode "As I Lay Hiccuping," Johnny goes to a very shapely female doctor to do something about his really bad case of the hiccups. When he returns to her for her "special treatment," the female doctor pulls off her rubber woman suit to reveal a male, bald and heavy doctor with a beard. Johnny's shocked reaction cures his hiccups, and the doctor reveals this trick works every time.
-   In a later episode of _King of the Hill_, Peggy befriends a drag queen, after discovering "she" has size 16 feet like her. The reveal is unsettling for both of them since Peggy thought Carolyn was a woman and Carolyn thought Peggy was a drag queen.
-   In _The Legend of Korra_, Bolin falls for both of Korra's cute twin cousins, Desna and Eska, before Korra reveals that they're actually Half-Identical Twins — Desna is a guy.
-   In _The Looney Tunes Show_ apparently even _Sylvester_ thought Tweety was a girl until Tweety himself told him.
-   In _The Simpsons_ episode "Bart's Girlfriend", Bart hears angelic singing coming from the Springfield church, and assumes that it's Jessica Lovejoy. Turns out it's Ned Flanders.
    
    **Bart**: Ughhhh. That's very disturbing.
    
    -   Similarily, in "Bart of Darkness, a series of incidents, starting with a woman screaming in horror, lead Bart to believe that Flanders killed his wife. At the end of the episode we see the clarification about Maude being missing because she was at a church trip and that the "murder" that Flanders commited was that he over-watered Maude's plant and killed it. Bart asks about the woman screaming, which Flanders says he can't explain... until Lou the policeman says they found the plant and show it. Ned proceeds to let out a very feminine scream.
-   Done in a two part episode of _South Park_ when Cartman, who's stuck in the future (long story, basically one of his usual schemes backfired), calls back to the past to reach Mr. Garrison who's recently had a sex change operation. Garrison is currently having sex with Richard Dawkins, Dawkins is the one to answer the phone and Cartman lets slip that Garrison is a post-Op. Needless to say Dawkins is repulsed. Not only that but by revealing this, it _completely changes the future_<sup>Explanation&nbsp;</sup> .
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: Patrick does this in the episode "That's No Lady" to everybody in the Krusty Krab, including Mr. Krabs and Squidward who had fallen for "her" after he tears off the girl disguise he was wearing. (Take note that he strips himself butt-naked in the process, resulting even more Squick to both suitors.)
    
    **Squidward:** Um... I think I need to take a shower.
    
-   The _Tiny Toon Adventures_ episode "Pluck O' The Irish" ends with a pretty lass revealing to Plucky and Hamton that she is actually three male leprechauns stacked up with the top one in a rubber girl mask.
-   _The Venture Bros._:
    -   Inverted. Dr. Girlfriend tried to seduce Brock a couple of times. Brock thinks Dr. Girlfriend is a transgender woman because of her masculine voice, so it doesn't work. However, the real reason she has a deep voice is due to her smoking habits.
    -   Inverted again. Doc never finds out Ginny is a woman because he's not even remotely attracted to her.
-   In the surprisingly serious short _What's Opera, Doc?_, Elmer Fudd finds out that the girl he fell for was Bugs Bunny in a dress — and _actually kills Bugs_ with his magic helmet. Although it's unclear whether he does it because Bugs is male, or if it's because Bugs rejects him the moment the disguise is off! Or because, well, he's Bugs.
    
    **Bug:** Well, what didja expect in an opera? A _happy_ ending?
    
    -   In another episode, _Mississippi Hare_, Bugs disguises himself as a southern belle to escape the antagonist of the episode, Colonel Shuffle. Bugs enlists the help of another passenger, who throws Shuffle overboard the riverboat to protect the "little flower of the south". He's clearly quite smitten with Bugs until he gets a good look at his rear end after his skirt was ripped. Whether the gentleman realized the lady he helped was male or was a rabbit (or both) is unclear, but the poor schmuck makes a stupefied expression, and walks himself overboard while muttering incoherently.

    Real Life 

-   Taken to its most unpleasant extreme by _Erythrinus erythrinus_, a predatory fish native to the Amazon. Juvenile members of this species mimic the appearance of the female members from the _Laimosemion_ genus. When an amorous male of that genus comes seeking a prospective mate, he gets eaten.
-   Shi Pei Pu (Chinese: 时佩璞; pinyin: Shí Pèipú; December 21, 1938 – June 30, 2009) was a Chinese opera singer from Beijing. He became a spy who obtained secrets from Bernard Boursicot, an employee in the French embassy, during a 20-year-long sexual affair in which he convinced Bernard that he was a woman. This is the basis of the play _M. Butterfly_, later adapted to a movie of the same name.
-   There are several species of fish and at least one cuttlefish species among which smaller males mimic the color-patterns and body language of females. This is done to deflect large males' aggression as the small males sneakily insinuate their way into the large males' harems of females. Should the large male catch on while attempting to court such a poseur, this trope (and a nasty fight or pursuit) ensues.
-   This is the reason why the term "trap" is considered a slur by the Transgender community, the implication of the term being that trans people (and especially trans women) are trying to "trick" people into sleeping with them, rather than just being who they are. Unfortunately, this can have serious consequences for trans people. In some jurisdictions, they can be prosecuted for rape by fraud. Further, numerous trans women have been murdered after cis male partners learned of their status. A number of jurisdictions have (or had) the so-called "trans panic" defense, which permitted a defendant charged with murder in such a case to argue they flew into a rage on discovering this. If accepted, it could lead to acquittal or at least the charge being reduced (i.e. being manslaughter rather than murder).

During the climax of the movie Robots, Fender briefly mistakes Madame Gasket the Big Bad of the film for a man though Madame Gasket quickly corrects him. Ironically she is voiced by a actual man, actor Jim Broadbent.
