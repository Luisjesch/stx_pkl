An important criterion when choosing a new car.

_"Automobiles. A type of land vehicle used for transport. Also used in teenage mating rituals."_

Two characters have sex in the back seat of a car. Extra points if it's somewhere with a name like "Make-Out Point", or in the back of a Shag Wagon made for this purpose.

Being in the back seat, while typical, isn't 100% required. It also happens in the front seat, though it's more cramped. A different kind of bonus points if it takes place _while one of them is driving_ (which is absolutely possible but extremely dangerous just from a distraction standpoint).

Moral or divine punishment for Auto Erotica (particularly at an isolated Make-Out Point) often manifests itself in the form of a Serial Killer on a prison break looking for fresh meat, a cop making his rounds, or an overprotective knight templar father armed with a shotgun or a baseball bat and out to defend his daughter's purity. Other forms of interruption, with varying levels of humiliation, abound.

Truth in Television, obviously — the romantic potentials of cars have been recognized from the beginning of the automotive age. The Edwardians dubbed them "brothels-on-wheels". Teenagers have been, and largely remain, the traditional people portrayed as doing this, due to not having privacy at home, and not being able to afford a hotel room. Not as common as it used to be, as today both parents usually have full-time jobs, giving teens more opportunity for time alone in the house, but it's still there.

Not to be confused with sexual attraction/relationships with cars, robots, or vacuum cleaners, sexy people posing on the outside of cars, (or actual autoerotica). It is also not to be confused with Car Porn (where the "porn" part is metaphorical).

Supertrope of Don't Come A-Knockin', where the car is noticeably rocking around.

Compare Mile-High Club (having sex in an airplane in flight).

    Advertising 

-   In this Chrysler Concorde commercial, Savannah learns that she was named after the place where she was conceived, and so was her baby sister, Concorde.
-   Around 1970, a rather innocuous European car (Renault?) had a magazine ad touting its qualities as macho, including seats that folded down into a bed (later ads dropped a line about 'extending your manhood' at that point).
-   A Peugeot ad consisted of little more than a couple having (very enthusiastic) sex in the advertised car.
-   This Volkswagen ad has a couple enjoy some quality time in their car. Cut to them buying a new Volkswagen with a kid. Then they do it a second time and buy a new Volkswagen with a second kid. Then a third time, same results. The final shot has their newest vehicle shaking... from the shenanigans of the kids inside.
-   In a commercial for State Farm auto insurance, a teen girl just got her own car with her own insurance and no longer needs to drive her parents' hand-me-down. The parents present said car as a "surprise" gift to her younger brother, who laments that he'll never get a date in this car. The dad says "We had a lot of great dates in this car," much to the son's disgust.
-   In a TV ad for a classical music radio station, two cars (a Camaro and a Volvo) are parked at "Make-Out Point" overlooking the city below. Both cars are rocking on their shocks, and we can hear music coming from both: pop music from the Camaro and classical music from the Volvo. After a few seconds the pop music ends and the Camaro stops rocking, but the classical music and the Volvo's motion continue. As the camera pans up to view the stars overhead the voiceover announces, "The average pop song lasts three and a half minutes, but the average classical song is fifteen minutes..."

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Fairy Tail: 100 Years Quest_, when Earth-Lucy asks Edolas-Lucy how she and Edolas-Natsu ended up getting married, the latter says that "he came really strong on her" when they were in his car.
-   A chapter of _Futari Ecchi_ is dedicated to this trope. Containing useful advice (both social and hygienic) on how to do it properly. (Like explanations on why it's inadvisable to do it on the front seat or why it's preferable to turn off the lights.)
-   _Initial D_:
    -   One episode has Takumi and Natsuki making out in Takumi's Trueno, to the point where we see the car rocking for a bit.
    -   Subverted in the Second Stage OVA when Itsuki literally sleeps with a girl in his Levin.
-   In the _Junjou Romantica_ manga, this happens in a parking garage after Misaki sprains his ankle and Usagi-san (of course) comes to his rescue.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans_: Mikazuki and Atra were only even _able_ to have sex in a mobile suit cockpit (or perhaps floating around right outside it). Thanks to abusing his suit's Brain/Computer Interface, Mikazuki was half-paralyzed whenever he wasn't hook up to it.
-   In a flashback in Episode 10 of _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_, Fastener had sex with a cheerleader in his convertible.
-   _Revolutionary Girl Utena_ employs this trope in a way that deliberately makes it unclear how just what kind of business people are getting up to. Every major character takes a ride in the "Akio Car", and the car itself explicitly represents the world of adulthood - it is powerful, sexy, and seems simultaneously luxurious and sleazy.
    -   On the more literal end, Akio indulges Wakaba's girlish crush on him by taking her for a drive, which is the most innocuous use of the car in the show. This leads into Akio's seduction of Utena in the car as Anthy looks on from afar. The Duellists' rides to the End of the World are more subject to interpretation. There are psychosexual implications for all of them, and Ruka and Shiori pretty obviously have sex in the back seat, but the ride takes on different sorts of meanings for each of the characters.
    -   All of this contributes to an automotive/driving-based symbolic language, and the show puts it to devastating use in the episode where Utena has (dubiously consensual) sex with Akio to convey aspects of Utena's feelings about this event that she is barely even consciously aware of.
-   Happens in _Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi_ when Ritsu and Takano go on a date on Takano's birthday. It gets a Sexy Discretion Shot in the anime adaptation. Ritsu later claims his memories of Takano's car aren't exactly good as a result.

    Comic Books 

-   _Scott Pilgrim_ and Kim Pine are seen doing this in a flashback.
-   "Hot Rod Boogie", generally regarded as the first true _Cherry Comics_ story, is all about this.
-   _Domino Lady_: In the Eros Comix miniseries, Domino Lady and Det. Rob Wyatt start having sex in the back of Ellen's limousine when they are affected by the Mind-Control Music. Their liaison is cut short when Delglyn drives the car off a bridge and into the river.
-   _Red Ears_: One gag has a young couple having sex in a car. The girl then says the guy was great and she adds that the fact that it was "their first time" was the most exciting part. The next shot shows the guy tick off another stripe on the side of his car.
-   Averted in _W.I.T.C.H._: a minor character tries this on Irma, who was using her older and more attractive Guardian form to flirt with him, but she wasn't ready and accidentally turned him in a toad.

    Fan Works 

-   In the second season of _Children of Time_, the Holmeses have their first time since their reunion in the back of Beth's police cruiser. ...they really _did_ wait a _very_ long time for this.
-   This _Engine Sentai Go-onger_ fanfic involving Sosuke and Miu making love in the backseat of his car. Much like the _Misfiled Dreams_ example above, it's lampshaded due to the major car motif of the Go-ongers.
-   In _Forbiden Fruit: The Tempation of Edward Cullen_, two gay men and a gay _panda_ all manage to fit in the back of a car to have a three-way. The fact that a panda took part (and owns the car) means the car was most likely a semi-truck of some description.
-   In a deliberate reference to _NCIS_ (see Live-Action TV, below), in _From Bajor to the Black_ Eleya loses her virginity with another member of her training platoon in the back of an infantry fighting vehicle.
    
    **Author's Note:** Bajorans are basically post-Holocaust space Jews in a lot of ways and Eleya’s a badass action girl, so what the hey?
    
-   _Guys Being Dudes_: There's a flashback of Candela and Arlo making out in the back of her car when he comes out to her. Spark and Arlo do the same in Arlo's car after their visit to the Sleepless Bakery.
-   In one HookerVerse fic, The Cinema Snob has sex with the Critic in the back of his limo.
-   KITT Copycat had Pepper and Tony having sex at the back of his car while 'JARVIS was driving'.
-   One chapter of _Meg's Boyfriend_ had Meg and Zack doing it _in a tank_. Of course, it's not at all comfortable, and they end up blasting Cleveland's house.
-   Naturally, since _Misfiled Dreams_ has cars as a major theme like the original story, this had to happen at least once. It's even lampshaded with the line "Somehow… I knew we’d wind up doing this in a car."
-   In _My Immortal_, Draco and Enoby have sex in Draco's flying car.
-   _My Old Kentucky Home_:
    
    **Harry:** Whoa is that an E type \[Jaguar\]?  
    **Lily:** I told you Sirius was nuts about cars. Back before you were conceived he and James had a stupid Dodge Charger brought over they rebuilt. That might actually have been where you were conceived after I think about it.
    
-   In Timing is Everything, Beast Boy and Raven have their first time in the T-Car. Cyborg (who considers the car his "baby") doesn't find out until it turns out Raven became pregnant during that time, at which point he is really upset at his car being desecrated, demands to be the child's godfather and forces Beast Boy to clean the car something like 50 times straight. Then Beast Boy recommends that Starfire sits in the car during the next IVF attempt... the Law of Inverse Fertility has been at work for her and Robin a bit too hard the last time.
-   _Vow of Nudity_: Fiora keeps a succubus company in her carriage while Haara's washing the outside to pay off a debt.

    Films — Animated

    **Chris:** Suck me, beautiful  
    It doesn't work.
    
-   _Animal House_ includes a scene in which Babs is implied to have given Greg Marmalard a hand-job in his car - this isn’t shown, she appears sitting in the front seat, removing a rubber glove...
-   The inciting incident of _Army of the Dead_ involves a honeymooning couple crashing into a U.S. military convoy on a highway outside Las Vegas, because the driver was getting fellatio from his new wife.

-   Subversion: in _Back to the Future_, George McFly intervenes to _prevent_ Biff from raping George's future wife Lorraine in Biff's car. Then again, Lorraine seems like she may or may not be trying to get someone else in the backseat before Biff shows up. Specifically, Marty.
-   _Beast (2017)_: At one point, Moll and Pascal have sex in his truck. It gets a Cerebus Call-Back when she and Pascal are driving down the road at the end of the film, and, having learned that, he's the killer, Moll grabs the steering wheel and drives them off the road, killing him.
-   _Bedazzled (1967)_: Stanley wishes for himself and the woman he loves to be really nice people, madly in love with each other, in a cozy domestic setting - and ends up in just that scenario...with her married to his best friend. They try trysting in her car, but they're _so_ nice that they're positively grievous with guilt for even trying it.
-   _Beyond the Valley of the Dolls_: Harris has sex with Ashley in the back of her Rolls Royce. During the act, Ashley keeps talking about how nothing compares to sex in a Rolls. "Not even a Bentley!"

-   The B-movie _The Chase (1994)_ with Charlie Sheen and Kristy Swanson features their characters having sex in a car. _While Sheen is driving._ _And being chased by police._
-   Being an Awful British Sex Comedy, this trope is naturally present in _Confessions of a Driving Instructor_, although Timmy Lea finds out repeatedly that having sex in a car (a British car at that) is quite difficult.
-   Bizarrely exaggerated in _The Counselor_. In one of the movie's most infamous scenes, the drug dealer Reiner recalls his girlfriend Malkina once telling him that she wanted to "fuck \[his\] car"; he assumed that she wanted to have sex with him _in_ his car, but she assured him that she meant exactly what she said. In a flashback scene, Malkina then proceeds to bring herself to orgasm by masturbating herself against the windshield of Reiner's car while he watches. It Makes Just As Much Sense In Context.
-   _Crank_: Chev gets Eve to do this to him while they're being chased by gang members.
    -   He's _very_ upset that she doesn't finish the job, but she points out that he needs to keep his adrenalin _up_, not fall asleep immediately after. In frustration, he walks out and shoots the bad guys, much to Eve's horror.
        -   Then again, it could be payback for _him_ not finishing the job earlier in the movie, when he forced her to have sex in public in front of dozens of people (she resisted at first but got really into it later).
-   The opening scene of _Death Screams_ provides a variation with two lovers on top of a motorcycle.
-   Parodied and Averted in _Dragnet_, in a scene where Streebek tries to figure out where Friday is:
    
    **Streebek:** For a minute I pictures him introducing Ms. Swail to the one piece of his equipment not issued by the department. But then, I figured Joe Friday wouldn't be the type to spring for some third-rate motel. And since making love in a Yugo was a scientific impossibility, I knew something was up.
    
-   _Dressed to Kill_: Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson), a sexually unsatisfied suburban housewife, both seduces and is seduced by a handsome stranger in the Metropolitan Museum of Art; he consummates the seduction by dangling her glove (which she'd taken off earlier as a flirtation tactic) from the window of a taxicab. The couple have sex in the backseat, watched by The Peeping Tom cab driver in his rear-view mirror, culminating in Kate having a vigorous climax while being felt up by her partner.

''"I was conceived in the Riviera … but not the French Riviera. The Detroit variety."'

-   At the beginning of _GoldenEye_, James Bond seduces his evaluator after a car chase in his Aston Martin DB5. He even has champagne and glasses stashed in the center console to help things along.

The next scene opens with them still in the car, J.D. with his clothes and hair slightly disheveled and Veronica lying down with her head in his lap, mirroring an earlier scene where they were cuddling just after having had sex. Some viewers have taken this to mean something _else_ happened offscreen, but it's never stated outright.

-   This happens twice in _K-9_. The film opens up showing two people making out heavily in their car, though no nudity is presented. The other scene is when the dog, Jerry Lee, spots a poodle in the other car in front of him. This then leads to Jerry Lee and the poodle presumably 'doing it' in the car, though it's not shown, it is implied from Dooley's words ("What are you doing?!") what they are doing, as well as showing the car shaking.

-   Subverted yet played straight in the movie _Once Bitten_. Mark Kendall (Jim Carrey) tries to get to first base with Robin Pierce (Karen Kopkins) but she doesn't want to make out with Mark, especially in an ice cream van. Frustrated, Mark steps out of his ice cream van only to notice in utter shock that _**EVERYONE ELSE**_ was getting busy: the fleet of parked cars rocking and swaying from lovers' sowing their wild oats. Poor Mark.
-   In _Parenthood_, Helen tries this on her husband Gil while they are driving. Jump to the next scene: The car is totaled.
    -   After which the cop walks up and asks Helen and Gil what happened. Gil's response? "Well, honey, do you want to show him?"

    -   Tony has sex with Annette later, but stops when he finds out she's not "fixed" (no pill, no "IOU", no diaphragm). The implication of course is that he wasn't using a condom. At least it averts Can't Get Away with Nuthin'.

    -   April and her _ex_\-husband almost do this but stop.

-   _Tragedy Girls_ begins with what appears to be the standard opening for a slasher film: a blonde girl and her boyfriend making out in the backseat of a car with steamed-up windows at the local make-out spot (in this case, a covered bridge). The girl hears a noise and sends the boy out to investigate. However, when the Serial Killer does show up, the film goes in a completely different direction.
-   In the first part of _Transformers (2007)_, Bumblebee seems to be trying to encourage Sam and Mikaela to do this. The situation is made weirder by the fact that Bumblebee _is_ the car. The ending scene shows Sam and Mikaela making out on top of Bumblebee's hood while the other Autobots calmly watch in vehicle mode, quite possibly making the term "Auto-erotica" a little too literal.
-   _The Tripper_: When Samantha is looking for Ivan she slides the van door only to find Jade and Muff having sex inside. They don't stop while telling her that they haven't seen him.
-   Zig-Zagged in _True Lies_. When Simon and Helen are driving in his Corvette, Simon acts like they're being followed and pushes her head into his lap, telling her to "keep your head down until we're out of the city." While Helen doesn't actually take the bait, it looks awfully suspicious to Harry's surveillance team.
-   In _Les Valseuses_, the two titular crooks pick up apathetic and terminally bored hairdresser Marie-Ange, who tags along for the ride. She informs them that she is incapable of orgasm, whatever they do to her, either singly or collectively. The guys take this as a challenge. In one scene, Pierrot is less than enchanted at being the third wheel, driving their car around a French city by night whilst his buddy Jean-Claude (played by Gérard Depardieu) makes love to Marie-Ange in the back seat, practically testing out the proposition. She does admit to a certain frisson of interest, but no orgasm.
-   In _Vampires vs. Zombies_, Carmilla and Tessa have lesbian sex in the Jeep on the side of the road.
-   Parodied and subverted in _Whip It_ when the protagonist comes home to find her father's van rocking outside the house, and hear him shouting "YES! YES!". It turns out that he's watching a football game on a TV in the van because her mother won't let him watch in the house because he gets too excited.
-   _The White Orchid_: Claire gets fingered by a woman in a taxi as they go home together.

    Jokes 

-   Simple joke for the trope: "Children in the backseat cause accidents. Accidents in the backseat cause children."
-   There is a joke about a driver picking up a hitchhiking girl with a jerrycan. Turns out it's filled with fuel, which, according to her, tends to run out in all male-driven cars as soon as they get near a forest.

    **Cop:** "I'm sorry. I didn't know."
    
    **Man:** "Neither did I before you turned on the light."

The woman freaks but can't get him off her; she nevertheless manages to summon help, who get the emergency services to come out. They determine that the only way to get him out of there is to take the roof off the car. The fire department saws the roof of the car and manages to get the guy out, and as the paramedics are taking him away a police officer tries to comfort the woman, who is sobbing hysterically. She says "Don't worry, your husband's going to be fine." The woman replies "Fuck him, he's not my husband. It's my husband's car, though."
-   Two teenagers (the girl is blonde) are making out in the front seat of the guy's car. He suggestively asks if she wants to go to the backseat, she says no. They keep making out, he asks again, she still says no. After the third round, he finally asks why she doesn't want to move...
    
    **Blonde:** Because I can't kiss you if we're on different sides of the car, duh!

-   In Barbara Wersba's _The Dream Watcher_ Albert expresses his disapproval of this sort of thing.
    
    As a matter of fact, I think their attitude towards sex is depressing. Because I am almost totally convinced that the point of sex is not to get some poor girl in the back of some broken-down car and make her hysterical. I don't think girls even _like_ wrestling around in somebody's father's car and losing their reason. I don't know. I'm probably neurotic or impotent or something, but I don't think sex should be crude.

    Music 

-   The Andrews Sisters' rendition of "Last Night on the Back Porch":
    
    I love him in the springtime  
    And I love him in the fall  
    But last night in a taxi I \[mildly suggestive humming\]  
    Last night in the rumble seat \[slight giggling and more humming\]
    
-   "In the Car" by Barenaked Ladies is a subversion. While the song talks about the singer and his girlfriend exploring the possibility of doing this, he later admits they never actually did.
-   Beyoncé's song "Partition" is a very graphic description of having sex in the back of a limousine.
-   Subverted in Big Star's "Back of a Car", as the singer winds up explaining that he/she just isn't ready yet:
    
    _Why don't you take me home  
    It's gone too far inside this car  
    I know I'll feel a whole lot more  
    When I get alone_
    
-   The Bluetones' hilariously unsubtle "Autophilia (Or, How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love My Car)", which is so ridiculous that it could easily be mistaken for the lust being directed towards _the car itself_. She does come in sixteen colours, after all.
-   Bon Jovi:
    
    -   "Never Say Goodbye":
    
    _Remember when we used to park  
    out on Butler Street out in the dark.  
    Remember when we lost the keys,  
    and you lost more than that in my backseat._
    
    -   "Wild In The Streets":
    
    _Oh yeah, making love in the backseats._
    
-   The Bowling for Soup song "Two-Seater" is a post-breakup song that references this trope. As part of his revenge against the girl who just dumped him, the singer broke into his ex's car and (among other vandalisms) removed the back seat where they used to make out.
-   Mentioned in the song "Ain't Goin' Down" by Garth Brooks.
    
    "One-o'-clock, that truck is rockin'"
    
-   From "Money" by Cardi B: "He eat it in the car, that's meals on wheels!"
-   Vanessa Carlton's "White Houses" mentions this.
    
    _Sneakin' to his car's cracked leather seat  
    The smell of gasoline in the summer heat..._
    
-   Harry Chapin:
    -   In "Taxi", the singer mentions that he and Sue "learned about love in the back of a Dodge".
    -   In "Northwest 222", his SO would pick him up from the airport in the van and they'd "find a place for parking when the loving would not wait".
-   Lou Christie's "Rhapsody in the Rain" was banned upon release because of this trope: two teens had sex in a car on their first date, and the girl dumped the boy, who can only think of her now when he hears rain on the car.
-   "Making Love in a Subaru" by Damaskas points out the difficulties of attempting this in a compact car.
-   Death Cab for Cutie's "We Looked Like Giants," remembering how the speaker and his old girlfriend were "fumbling to make contact" in his "gray subcompact."
-   Elastica has "Car Song." Not just _inside_ cars, in this case.
    
    _Every shining bonnet  
    Makes me think of my back on it._
    
-   Paul Evans' 1959 hit "Seven Little Girls Sitting in the Back Seat" is kind of a G-rated version of this. The narrator/driver keeps trying to capture the attention of the titular girls, to no avail:
    
    _Keep your mind on your drivin'  
    Keep your hands on the wheel  
    Keep your snoopy eyes on the road ahead  
    We're havin' fun sittin' in the back seat  
    Kissin' and a-huggin' with Fred_
    
-   Five For Fighting's "'65 Mustang" includes the lyrics:
    
    _She knows my secrets well  
    But her backseat won't ever tell  
    She's no Jezebel_

-   Sammy Johns took the '70s van culture and made an ode to this trope with his "Chevy Van":
    
    _I gave a girl a ride in my wagon, she crawled in and took control.  
    She was tired 'cause her mind was draggin', I said get some sleep and dream of rock and roll.  
    Just like a picture she was layin' there, moonlight dancin' off her hair.  
    She woke up and took me by the hand, we made love in my Chevy van and that's alright with me_
    
-   Judas Priest's "Turbo Lover":
    
    We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive
    
    And everything goes rushing by, with every nerve alive
    
    We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky
    
    Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry.
    
-   Kesha:
    
    -   "Blah Blah Blah" discusses the possibility of this:
    
    _Think you'll be getting this? Nah, nah, nah  
    Not in the back of my car ah ah  
    If you keep talking that blah, blah, blah_
    
    -   "Gold Trans Am" is an entire song dedicated to her trying to get a man into her "golden cockpit" until he's seeing stars and stripes.
-   Tom Lehrer's "Bright College Days" alludes to it.

    To the spacious back seat  
    Of our roommate's beat up Chevrolet

    Where you know it's nice and dark

    -   "Hot Patootie (What Ever Happened to Saturday Night?)":
    
    _I used to drive around with a chick who'd go  
    listen to the music on the radio.  
    A saxophone was blowing on a rock 'n' roll show.  
    You climbed in the backseat,  
    really had a good time._
    
-   Marina & the Diamonds reference it in "The Outsider", in the context of the rest of the song, could be viewed as a little creepy...
    
    _Don't get on my bad side  
    I can work a gun  
    Hop into the backseat baby  
    I'll show you some fun_
    
-   Paul McCartney's "The Back Seat of My Car" starts out with the singer and his girl just sitting and hiding in, well, the back seat of his car because her father told her making love there was wrong. Eventually, they give in and do it.
-   The Nickelback song "Animals" is about this, ending with the singer and his girlfriend being interrupted by the girlfriend's father. Oh, Crap!
-   The early industrial track "Warm Leatherette" by The Normal (a band fronted by Daniel Miller, better known as the founder of its label Mute Records - this was its debut release), and famously covered by Grace Jones, graphically describes lovemaking in a burning car wreck. According to Miller, the song was inspired by J.G. Ballard’s _Crash_.
-   KT Oslin's "Cornell Crawford":
    
    _Cornell Crawford  
    He's the one who turns me on  
    He's gonna pick me up in his pick-up truck  
    He's gonna take me down the road to have a little fun  
    He's got a pack of Camels  
    He's got that quart of whiskey  
    And he's got it wrapped up nice in a brown paper bag  
    Oh, we're gonna stop  
    We're gonna park  
    We're gonna get down to it in stark_
    
-   OutKast's "Hey Ya":
    
    _I don't want to meet your daddy  
    I just want you in my Caddy  
    I don't want to meet your momma  
    I just want to make you come-a_
    

-   During the Pink Floyd song "Run Like Hell" from _The Wall_, Pink warns that even lovers in cars are not safe from the wrath of the Hammers:
    
    _You better run all day and run all night  
    Keep your dirty feelings deep inside  
    And if you take your girlfriend out tonight  
    You better park your car well out of sight  
    Cause if they catch you in the backseat trying to pick her locks  
    They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box!  
    You better run!_
    
-   Prefab Sprout averted the Springsteen version of the trope, very explicitly, in "Cars and Girls":
    
    _Brucie dreams life's a highway too many roads bypass my way  
    Or they never begin. Innocence coming to grief  
    At the hands of life - Stinkin' car thief, that's my concept of sin  
    Does heaven wait all heavenly over the next horizon ?  
    But look at us now, quit driving, some things hurt more much more than cars and girls.  
    Just look at us now, start counting, what adds up the way it did when we were young?  
    Look at us now, quit driving, some things hurt much more than cars and girls..._
    
-   Queen's "I'm In Love With My Car" is more making love _to_ the car. (As the title implies.)

    all I hear is your gear.  
    With my hand on your grease gun,  
    It's like a disease son._
    
-   "Sleeping In My Car" by Roxette:
    
    _Sleeping in my car. I will undress you.  
    Sleeping in my car. I will caress you.  
    Staying in the backseat of my car making love, oh yeah._
    
-   Parodied in a video for Run–D.M.C.'s "Mary Mary", where the woman in charge of Women Against Rap (W.A.R.) sees a van that is rocking and assumes that sex is going on, but instead she opens it up and sees women inside working out with exercise machines.
-   Bob Seger's "Night Moves". ("Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy...")
-   The Tom Smith song "Whose Idea Was It" centers around how awkward this can be, especially if it's a small car.
-   Bruce Springsteen sang a fair bit about cars and girls in his _Born to Run_ period, and the title track of that album raises the trope to the level of a fetish:
    
    _Wendy let me in, I want to be your friend  
    I want to guard your dreams and visions  
    Just wrap your legs around these velvet rims  
    And strap your hands across my engines..._
    
-   Gwen Stefani's "Bubble Pop Electric":

-   "Steamy Windows" by Tina Turner:

    We was out on a back road.  
    Me and my baby was just getting right.  
    All systems on overload.  
    Radio blasting in the front seat.  
    Turning out the music fine.  
    And we were snuggled up in the backseat,  
    making up for lost time._
    
-   The back cover of Tom Waits' album _Blue Valentines_ shows him making out with his then-girlfriend Rickie Lee Jones against a car.
-   Warrant's "Cherry Pie" mentions this:
    
    _Swingin' to the bass  
    In the back of my car!  
    Ain't got money!  
    Ain't got no gas!  
    But we'll get where  
    We're goin' if we  
    Swing real fast!_
    
-   ZZ Top's "Got Me Under Pressure":
    
    "But she won't let me use my passion  
    Unless it's in a limousine"
    

    Theatre 

-   In _J.B._, Nickles described this as one of the things Satan sees through the open eyes of his mask in the course of Walking the Earth:
    
    He sees the parked car by the plane tree.  
    He sees behind the fusty door,  
    Beneath the rug, those almost children  
    Struggling on the awkward seat—  
    Every impossible delighted dream  
    She's ever had of loveliness, of wonder,  
    Spilled with her garters to the filthy floor.  
    Absurd despair! Ridiculous agony!
