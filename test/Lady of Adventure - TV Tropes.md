_"Miss Vesper Holly has the digestive talents of a goat and the mind of a chess master. She is familiar with half a dozen languages and can swear fluently in all of them. She understands the use of a slide rule but prefers doing calculations in her head. She does not hesitate to risk life and limb — mine as well as her own. No doubt she has other qualities yet undiscovered. I hope not."_

— The very first lines of _**The Illyrian Adventure**_ by Lloyd Alexander

She is a high-class lady (though usually not a member of royalty), self-sufficient, but not willing to get tied down in marriage (though she may find love in her travels, she will always choose adventure over love — not even defrosting will help). Sometimes, her Big Fancy House will contain mementos of past adventures. At home, she may be a Proper Lady but as a rule, crosses over into Spirited Young Lady; quite frankly, her activities would frighten her more domestic counterparts.

For you see, she doesn't just find excitement — she specifically seeks it out. She thinks nothing of beating up pirates off the coast of the Trucial States or outwitting remnant tribes of Mayincatec humanitarians.

Most often, she will have no powers of her own to speak of (though she may have some small degree of physical prowess) but will surround herself with a band of friends that will help her on her travails. She will almost certainly live to become a Cool Old Lady.

Usually filled to the brim with British Stuffiness and almost always wears Gorgeous Period Dress (while still fitting for the high seas and hot sun). Often found in The Edwardian Era.

Compare and contrast Lady of Black Magic and Lady of War. The Distaff Counterpart and likely wife of the Gentleman Adventurer. Often wears a ladylike Adventurer Outfit.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The _Dark Gathering_ character Eiko is a modern example. Although she's a brilliant hacker/day trader, those occupations are largely to fund her _real_ passion: studying murderous ghosts. Apparently the adrenaline rush of almost dying gets her hot.
-   _Secret of Cerulean Sand_: After hearing the news that her brother, George, was allegedly shot for treason while on a desert expedition, Jane Buxton decides to learn the truth of what happened for herself. So she sets off on a grand adventure across the globe though her butler Chambellin insists on going with her. She's only 14, after all.

    Audio Plays 

-   Charlotte "Charley" Pollard in the _Big Finish Doctor Who_ audios, who (originating in the actual Edwardian era) frequently describes herself as "Edwardian adventuress". She has many amazing adventures with the Doctor, a Time Lord who can travel _anywhere_ in space and time.

    Comic Books 

-   The writers tend to forget this, but Captain Britain and his sister Psylocke are members of a fabulously wealthy family. While Captain Britain sometimes resents his calling, Psylocke fits this to a 'T', even after her Stripperiffic ninja makeover.
-   Lady Johanna Constantine of _Hellblazer_ and _The Sandman (1989)_. She was an 18th and 19th century aristocrat and adventurer, and an ancestor of John Constantine. She was the daughter of Lord and Lady Constantine, orphaned at a young age when her parents were hanged for treason. Stripped of her title, she was forced to live in poverty. Her luck turned in 1785 when King George III asked her to retrieve Pandora's Box. If she succeeded, her title would be reinstated, and she would be given an estate.
-   Mina Murray from _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_: a British adventurer turned immortal, a former music teacher and agent for the British Secret Service.
-   _Nightwing_ foe Lady Vic is a villainous version of this trope. Lady Elaine Marsh-Morton is descended from a long line of British soldiers and mercenaries, and a genuine English aristocrat. The money she earns from her secret career an assassin, bounty hunter, and mercenary helps prevent foreclosure on her impoverished family estate. She uses the vast collection of weaponry from the world accumulated by her ancestors as her personal arsenal.
-   Emma Bishop of _Ruse_ is described as "A fetching beauty whose spirit craves adventure." Her day job is as the assistant to a danger-prone Insufferable Genius Victorian detective (sound familiar?), compensating for his lack of social and linguistics skills. Not mentioned: mysterious time-stopping powers, which she's not supposed to reveal under any circumstances...
-   Jane Porter of _Tarzan_ gets this characterization in her Dynamite Comics appearances, most notably in the _Swords of Sorrow_ crossover.
-   Dejah Thoris in _Warlord of Mars_ is also like this, especially in her prequel series where she takes all kinds of crazy adventures that rival those of her husband John Carter like visiting other worlds, fighting vampires, finding lost civilizations and fending off alien invasions. What makes it impressive is that she is a Badass Normal instead of a Heavy Worlder like Carter.

    Fan Works 

-   Kit Bennett, PhD., _alias_ Kathy Watson in _Children of Time_: a Badass Bookworm from a respectable family, born in Victorian London. By chance (we think), she's also a Time Lady. She is a physicist, she is a century old by World War II, and she's been all over Time and Space with the Doctor. (Yes, she's a River Song Expy.)
-   In the _Discworld_ of A.A. Pessimal, marginal canonical character Miss Alice Band is this. Daughter of an archbishop and now a senior tutor at the Assassins' Guild School, the elegant and ladylike Alice combines taking on _interesting_ Guild contracts, relaxes with a little recreational Stealth Archaeology, and then passes her skills and knowledge to the student Assassins she teaches.
-   _Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse_:
    -   Kodachi Kuno is an aristocratic heiress who has taken to the life of a pirate like a duck to water, considering sailing the Grand Line and regularly battling Sea Monsters, marines and rival pirates to be the greatest fun in her life.
    -   Penelope laFloo is the Happily Adopted daughter of a wealthy merchant from the East Blue nation of Frauce. She's also an Adventurer Archaeologist who was willing to explore the uncharted Death World that is the Grand Line, both for the sake of finding lost ruins and to seek out her lost people.

    Film — Animated 

-   A senior witch in _Kiki's Delivery Service_ flies past Kiki to greet her while Kiki flies towards a new city. You can tell by the senior witch's prim and proper voice as well as expensive jewelry that she comes from a luxurious life style. She also talks about returning home from various adventures regarding fortune telling.
-   _Tarzan_: Jane Porter, a well-off English gentlewoman is happy to explore the depths of the African jungle with her scientist father. In fact, she enjoys the jungle so much she decides to stay there permanently, lives in a treehouse, and even learns tree-surfing and vine-swinging from her husband. The spin-off TV series _The Legend of Tarzan_ has her involved in all manner of adventures involving such things as rogue elephants, leopard men, and escaped fugitives. One episode even involves some of her old friends from the aristocracy coming for a visit, and whilst initially Jane attempts to show she can still be a proper uppercrust gentlewoman, she ultimately admits that such airs are pointless in the jungle and could get them all killed.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   In _Cracks_, Miss G. pretends to be this to impress her students.

-   Lara Croft in the _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider_ films, crossed with a lot of Action Girl. She even has the Big Fancy House!

-   In _Out of Africa_, Karen goes to Africa specifically to be this. By the time she leads a caravan of cattle across the desert to an Allied army, she's definitely succeeded.

    Literature 

### **In General:**

-   Older Than Print: The Damsels Errant found in knightly romances (the lovely mysterious young ladies who guide and advise the knight on his adventures) are an early form of this trope.

### **By Work:**

-   Kate De Vries from the _Airborn_ trilogy fits this reasonably well, although she's probably quite a bit younger than most of the other examples. In the second and third books in particular she's right on board with going on dangerous adventures.

-   Evadne Stephens from _The Extraordinaires_ is a version of this in her late teens. She is from an extremely wealthy family, but she has run away from home because of the restrictions placed upon her ambitions. She is highly intelligent, hugely inventive and she is also a fine juggler with an arresting stage presence.

-   In Geoph Essex's _Jackrabbit Messiah_, old Maggie Calloway is obviously a Lady Adventurer from an earlier time, with her Adventurer Outfit and unsubtle similarity to classic fiery Katharine Hepburn characters.
-   The eponymous Lady Trent from _A Memoir by Lady Trent_ series, a naturalist who travels the world to study dragons and become famous in her field, societal expectations, Culture Clash, deadly environments, and international politics be damned.
-   Europe from the _Monster Blood Tattoo_ series combines this trope, Lady of War, and Lady of Black Magic to create a refined, dignified monster hunter with cool clothes and an electric presence.
-   _The Parasol Protectorate_: Alexia Tarabotti, later Lady Maccon, is an upper-class preternatural with a fondness for tea and beating up her enemies with her Parasol of Pain who frequently finds herself dealing with unruly humans and supernaturals of all sorts. This is to the point that she's appointed muhjah, the preternatural member of the Shadow Council of Britain.
-   _Phryne Fisher_: The Honourable Phryne Fisher from _Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries_. Upper-class (and titled) lady in 1920's Australia with a liberal attitude towards love and many globe-trotting adventures under her belt. Competent pilot and motorcycle rider. Solves mysteries. Most other members of The Adventuress' Club also qualify.
-   Isabel in _The Portrait of a Lady_ wishes she could be one. She enjoys travelling very much, travels from her home America to England, then travels in Europe, visits Paris and chooses to settle in Italy.
-   _Sally Lockhart_ in the Philip Pullman novels involving her. She is a young woman who develops a passion for solving mysteries after her father's death. "Uncommonly pretty" and works as a financial consultant.

-   _Sherlock Holmes_: Irene Adler is a globetrotter known for seducing high-ranking political targets for pay and pleasure.
-   _Skies Unbroken_ has Verica Chantil, the scholarly biologist who has just a bit of Ship Tease with Kor. Technically a passenger, but contributes as much as she can.
-   Lady Sylvia in _Sorcery and Cecelia_ has the most amazing widowhood in all Regency England, involving international travel, politics, and spying.
-   Olive Nolan in _Tranquilium_. She is well-acquainted with many interesting people including Chri Williams, is very good with handguns, and has had run-ins with pirates even before the beginning of the novel.
-   _Wagons West_: Teddy Montague is very much this, as we see her excel in dealing with the natives in Brazil and the Philippines.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Romana (both of her), an actual Time Lady who travelled with the Fourth Doctor.
    -   Lady Christina de Souza in "Planet of the Dead" combines this with Classy Cat-Burglar, as she steals for the risk rather than the reward. The Doctor's parting gift to her is a _flying double-decker bus_ so that probably won't be a problem anymore.
    -   River Song can be this _or_ the Classy Cat-Burglar, depending at which point on her personal timeline the Doctor catches her.
        
        "Careful? Tried that once. Ever so dull."
        
    -   Sarah-Jane Smith to a small extent in _The Sarah Jane Adventures_. She's not blue-blooded, but she is a grown-up former companion with an alien supercomputer in her attic, who now mentors several young adventurers.
        
        "Maria, there are two types of people in the world. Those who panic, and then there's us. Got it?"
        
-   What Arya ends up being during the series finale when she travels outside of Westeros, in _Game of Thrones_.
-   The Honourable Phryne Fisher from _Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries_. Upper-class (and titled) lady in 1920's Australia with a liberal attitude towards love and many globe-trotting adventures under her belt. Competent pilot and motorcycle rider. Solves mysteries.
-   Miss Ruby Ogden from _Murdoch Mysteries_ (set in late Victorian/early Edwardian Canada). She comes from an upper-middle-class family (her father and her _sister_ are medical doctors). She pursues travelling, becomes a journalist and aspires to be a writer. We hear for example that she's in South America.
-   _QI_: Ronni Ancona did a lengthy impression of one of these (and read an actual journal entry from one) in the "Dictionary" episode.

-   Marguerite Krux in _Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World_. Although she has a shadier past than is usual for this trope, she still manages to pull off the typical attitudes and mannerisms.

    Radio 

-   Lady Alexandra Faversham, mother of _The Brothers Faversham_ and "The British Empire's greatest, sexiest and most pregnant spy". We never actually see much of her own adventures as she's always the Hero of Another Story, but her sons are invariably born slap-bang in the middle of them.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Several of the Seven Sisters in the _Dungeons & Dragons_ setting _Forgotten Realms_. Blessed by the goddess of magic to be her chosen servants, they are all powerful mages and almost immortal. Laeral, Dove, and Storm are all well known to have spent a lot of time digging through ancient ruins, but they also have very great reputations and are filthy rich.
-   Despite it being the 1930s in _Rocket Age_ lady adventurers are not uncommon. Exposure to alien cultures and a massive societal shift can cause that. The US Rocket Rangers even allows women into their ranks, though they are the only branch of the armed forces to do so.
-   _Space 1889_ The main book makes this a career for female player characters. Since this is in Victorian times she is theoretically the loyal companion or servant of a male adventurer. This is just social camouflage, though.

    Video Games 

-   _The Alliance Alive_ has Vivian von Esmerode, who is one of the Daemons who rule over all humanity but also a self-taught scholar who has just a lovely time fighting frontier beasts and clambering down factory ladders. (Her Battle Butler is less enthused.) She gets involved in the plot because she's helping a famous scientist do field research.
-   Nalia De'Arnise in _Baldur's Gate II_ is actually a noble, but has decided to actually do something instead of just sitting around at her families castle. Though she's not exactly very good at that before she joins the players group.
-   Phoebe from _Battleborn_ is a rich heiress who happens to be an inventor and adventurer.
-   _Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!_ has Lady Aurelia Hammerlock, an Egomaniac Hunter who comes from a wealthy family of upper-crust British stereotypes who travels the galaxy seeking dangerous game to hunt in order to alleviate the boredom that comes with being an exorbitantly wealthy heiress. As far as she's concerned, vault hunting on Elpis is simply a safari that gives her the chance to shoot lots of things.
-   Madeleine from _Bug Fables_ is a rich cicada killer wasp lady who goes around exploring dangerous corners of Bugaria with her butler Seb, requiring Team Snakemouth to help them out of various scraps. She even has a pith-colored summer hat, a leaf parasol, and dress-like color patterns on her skin that give her the stereotypical "19th-century aristocratic Englishwoman" look.
-   Leliana in _Dragon Age: Origins_ first appears to be a kind of nun and later a pious thief who found refuge in a monastery. However, she really is a professional spy and assassin who worked for the high society of her home country. She occasionally complains that even though traveling on the road and fighting the undead horde is fun, she really misses the fine clothes and art of her country and the company of other more sophisticated people.
-   After the events of _Final Fantasy X_, Lady <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Yuna donned a skirt and twin pistols to hunt artifacts with a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits. Unlike most examples of the trope, Yuna had a rather repressed childhood, so she's more making up for lost time than pursuing a lifelong career.
    
    "We fly all over Spira... I'm really enjoying myself."
    
-   Estellise in _Tales of Vesperia_—even though Flynn constantly tells her she should get back to the castle.
-   Lady Jane and Lady Jayne from the _TimeSplitters_ series. (They might be the same woman- it's hard to tell with the difference in graphics between games.)
-   Lara Croft in the _Tomb Raider_ games.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Darken_, Duchess Jill d'Avron is quite happy to feather her nest as a serial Black Widow, but happily joins Gort's group of Villain Protagonists — first for the hefty reward for harvesting a rare monster's eye, and then because collecting Artifacts of Doom for a Duke of Hell in an infernal power play helps one cultivate all _sorts_ of contacts.
-   _Delilah Dirk_ is this to a tee. Her dad was an ambassador, she adventures constantly, and has an appropriate outfit.
-   Jade English of _Homestuck_: Adoptive granddaughter of Betty Crocker and Colonel Sassacre, something of a Gadgeteer Genius, and a counterrevolutionary who maintains a secret base on a tropical island filled with fantastic beasts.

    Web Original 

-   Eleonora from _Greek Ninja_. Sasha and Electra somewhat qualify, but adventure found them rather than them seeking it out. Eleonora was quick to hop in on the adventure when the opportunity presented itself.

    Western Animation 

-   Goldie of _Goldie Gold and Action Jack_. Goldie is part of an Old Money family, but they still have a history of members being adventurers.

    Real Life 

-   Gertrude Sanford Legendre (1902-2000) was an American socialite who served as a spy during World War II. She was also a noted explorer, big-game hunter, environmentalist, and owner of Medway plantation in South Carolina. She spent 1923 to 1929 travelling the world as a big-game hunter in South Africa, Canada, and Alaska. Shortly after exploring Abyssinia for the American Museum of Natural History as part of the Sanford-Legendre Abyssinia Expedition, Gertrude Sanford married the expedition's co-leader Sidney J. Legendre on 17 September 1929. During WWII, Legendre worked for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), essentially as a spy. She was the first American woman captured on the western front in France by the Germans. Legendre was held as a prisoner of war for six months and then escaped into Switzerland. She lived to be 97 and wrote two autobiographies, one in 1948 and another in 1987. She once said, "I don't contemplate life. I live it."
-   Karen Blixen. The Real Life one.
-   Among her many pursuits Clare Boothe Luce who was an Intrepid Reporter during World War II.
-   Jessica Mitford, who was born into the upper class but rejected her Upper-Class Twit family because of their far-right political leanings and became a political activist (notably involved with the Communist Party and civil rights activism) and an investigative journalist.
-   Legendary British traveler and authoress Isabella Bird. A condensed list of the places she visited and wrote about: Australia, Hawaii, Colorado, Japan, Manchuria, Indochina, India, Tibet, Persia, Kurdistan, Turkey, and Morocco. Small wonder she was the first woman inducted into the Royal Geographical Society.
-   Lady Jane Digby, aristocratic beauty and adventurer, she ditched her husband the Earl of Ellenborough to elope with her lover, the Austrian statesman Felix zu Schwarzenberg. Felix abandoned her in Paris, but Jane soon found a lover of means — King Ludwig I of Bavaria. She wed another nobleman, Baron Karl von Venningen, and had a son with him, only to fall madly in love with Spyridon Theotokis. Her husband challenged Spyridon to a duel; although Karl wounded her lover, he agreed to release Jane from her marriage and astonishingly enough continued to be her friend. Her marriage to Spyridon survived her affair with King Otto I of Greece, but after their only son died tragically, he and Jane divorced. She took up with an Albanian brigand named Hristodoulos Hadzipetros, fighting alongside his men and living in caves, only to walk out on him after catching him with another woman. At forty-six, Jane Digby traveled to Damascus and enchanted Sheik Abdul Medjuel el Mezrab, twenty years her junior. She refused to marry him unless he sent his other wives back to their fathers, which he did. They were happily married for the rest of her life. Jane Digby died at 74, after a lifetime of passion and adventure.
-   Gertrude Bell (1868 – 1926), was a Real Life Adventure Archaeologist who served as a spy and diplomat in the Middle East during World War I, was a mentor to the famous Lawrence of Arabia, and played a major role in reshaping the Middle East after the fall of the Ottoman Empire following the war. She founded the Iraqi Archaeological Museum (which was sadly extensively looted during the 2003 invasion) and is still remembered with fondness among the people of the region, no small accomplishment for both a foreigner and a woman.
-   Lady Florence Baker, wife of explorer Samuel Baker. When Baker first met her she was a white slave destined for the harem of an Ottoman noble. Baker fell in love with her, and first tried to purchase her freedom. When that failed he bribed the guards and ran away with her. Then they fell in love and married and she followed him on his expeditions into the most unknown and dangerous parts of Africa. This story is so melodramatic few writers today would use but it really did happen.
-   Nellie Bly, one of the first investigative reporters in the world and almost certainly the first female investigative reporter. Her adventures included a race to travel around the world in fewer than 80 days; she sent telegrams to her publisher from every country she visited as a means of tracking her progress. She also once faked insanity in order to be admitted to an asylum and write about conditions on the inside, which prompted severe changes to the inhumane system for treating the mentally ill. That said, she bucked part of the tradition by being born and raised dirt-poor and making her own advantages.
-   Ginny Fiennes (AKA Lady Virginia Frances Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes), late wife of explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes and, amongst other achievements, the first woman to receive the Polar Medal.
