That is so offensive! Don't you know that only the Northern Hemisphere has Winter in December! <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

_"And in a gutless act of political correctness, 'Pizza Day' will now be known as 'Italian-American Sauced Bread Day.'"_

Works that parody attempts at political correctness by "overcompensating". May involve a governmental authority (often a local council or Media Watchdog) being accused of being over-zealous to the point of parody in trying to avoid offense to minority groups — not unlike the Culture Police but in the other direction. Certain words or phrases are said to have been "banned", as if, say, Chipping Sodbury Borough Council has any effective power over the English language or, indeed, _anything_.

Such parodies may involve a Granola Girl, Soapbox Sadie, or other Straw Character who objects to things they consider offensive, to the point of ridiculousness.

Parodies typically involve stylized Newspeak used in random areas the original does not cover as well as blatant Windmills. A Fractured Fairy Tale is a "reimagined" Fairy Tale often retold from a politically correct viewpoint, Played for Laughs.

Compare Political Correctness Is Evil for works that depict political correctness, exaggerated or otherwise, as outright detrimental to society.

    Advertising 

-   Audi used parodied political correctness in their Green Police Ads. Essentially the gestapo in smart cars. Predictably, many environmentalists were offended and claimed that the ad had Unfortunate Implications, apparently not realizing that it was just a gag.
-   Virgin Mobile used this in their advertisements during the winter of 2007-2008 to celebrate Chrismahanukwanzakah.
    
    **Everyone:** Whose faith is the right one, it's anybody's guess.  
    **Man in turban and Santa suit holding up a phone:** What matter most is camera phone for twenty dollar less!
    
-   Snickers had a football team being blessed before the big game by about twenty different holy men, a priest, a rabbi, an American Indian shaman, etc, all in the name of Political Correctness, with the implication this was going to take all afternoon.
-   Hilariously mocked in Saturday Night Live's fake advertisement for "Asian American Doll". The doll was made after a lot of "sensitivity meetings", she comes with a bland outfit, no name, a useless pull string, an empty dollhouse, and only two accessories (a puppy and a chef's hat). The girl in the commercial keeps coming up with a stereotype for the doll, like asking if she can help her with her homework, calling her Kiko, adding an Oriental rug to her house, and wondering if she can eat the puppy.
    
    **Announcer:** It's Asian American Doll, we made her from a place of fear! (_gong sound effect_) I specifically said no gong!
    

    Anime & Manga 

-   The _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ OVA "Paint It White" is about a race of aliens who use light to change everyone into gray emotionless faceless humanoid creatures, in an attempt to get them to stop fighting and pouting. They set up a base with Off-Model versions of several countries' famous landmarks around it.
-   _Shimoneta_ runs on this. The setting is Japan with exaggerated obscenity laws where everything vulgar from Fanservice to medical terms is censored (and enforced by making everyone wear special chokers and wristbands that alert the authorities to any obscene words, writings or drawings,) no one knows how babies are born and the main character does not know the concepts of Lust or Lewdness. The chief architect of this system makes it her goal in life to "remove all that is dirty from the world." This trope is also an opinion in-universe, one held by an obscenity terrorist whose alter ego Blue Snow wears panties on her head (and little else) who wants to take these laws down by placing porn everywhere.
-   Because of their physical differences, the world of _A Centaur's Life_ is plagued with a history of even worse racism and violence than our own. The races seem to live together in peace now (with the exception of some of the more "exotic" or isolated races), but the anti-racism laws are so strict that, for example, riding a centaur is a hate crime even if the centaur is the one offering, and all magical girls shows must include magical girls of every race with the main character changing every episode. Society even stresses "unity" over individuality.

    Comedy 

-   Larry the Cable Guy did a routine where he translated _Twas The Night Before Christmas_ into PC-speak. Non-Denominational Holiday Figure's trademark "ho ho ho" was replaced with "lady-of-the-evening lady-of-the-evening lady-of-the-evening" He also had Snow Caucasian and the Seven Handy Capable Little Persons (including Mood-Enhanced Little Person, Slightly Mentally Impaired Little Person, and Little Person in Need of Anger Management, among others), Vertically-Challenged Native American Riding Hood, and The Tortoise and the Hare and the Non-Competitive Fun Run. All versions lampshade this trope endlessly.

-   British comic Stewart Lee does a brilliant routine defending political correctness by discussing how insisting "political correctness has gone mad" has lost meaning due to people using it as a Strawman for everything they disagree with:
    
    \[On his Nan abusing the term to confusion\] "In the old days, you could get your head and you could submerge it in a vat of boiling acid, and now they're going 'Oh, don't do that, what if Jews see it? It'll annoy the Jews'."
    
-   Robin Williams, in reference to people complaining about mentioning God in the Pledge of Allegiance, suggested, "How about, 'One Nation, under Canada, over Mexico'!"
-   During Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special, this exchange with Achmed the Dead Terrorist (who is trying to sneak into the United States wearing a Santa hat) happens, all lampshaded:
    
    **Jeff:** Your disguise is this Christmas hat?  
    **Achmed:** No! Don't say "Christmas"! It's a _holiday_ hat.  
    **Jeff:** Why can't I say "Christmas"?  
    **Achmed:** You offend the other infidels.  
    **Jeff:** You're afraid of offending people.  
    **Achmed:** Yeah.  
    **Jeff:** But you're a terrorist. You kill people.  
    **Achmed:** That's different.  
    **Jeff:** What?  
    **Achmed:** Killing folks is easy. Being politically correct is a pain in the ass.
    
    -   And earlier, with Walter:
    
    **Jeff:** So, Walter, Happy Holidays!
    
    **Walter:** \*beat\* You're _really_ going to do this, huh?
    
    **Jeff:** So, Walter, Happy Holidays!
    
    **Walter:** Screw you, it's Merry Christmas!
    
-   Dara O'Briain has a routine in one of his stand-up shows in which he describes receiving a letter of complaint from a gay-rights campaign after making a joke about Elton John writing the score for a musical version of _Billy Elliot_ because "he saw a little of himself _in_ Billy Elliot", which accused him of contributing to "a culture of violence against gay men." It's played with in that O'Briain, while clearly finding their specific accusation a bit ludicrous ("their previous target was Robert Mugabe ... and now _me_."), initially describes his defensive reaction before conceding that the complaint had a point, he had no real defence for it and as an Irishman he's benefited quite a bit from increased politically correct attitudes so really doesn't have much cause to complain about them. He also goes on to point out that a lot of typical defences of politically incorrect material from stand-up comedians such as "civil rights, comedy's obligation to say the difficult thing and freedom of speech" tend to sound a bit lofty and pretentious for what are, most of the time, basically dick jokes.
    -   In another show, he discussed religious people who kept coming up to him after he made jokes about Catholics and Protestants for being "too scared" to make jokes about Muslims instead. Dara pointed out that the real reason that he didn't make jokes about Muslims was that neither he nor his likely audience actually _knew_ anything about Muslims, so even if he was to make a brilliant joke about Islam most of the people in the audience wouldn't get it anyway.
-   While joking about her experiences in the Deep South, Rene Hicks stated that she doesn't respond to the N-Word, as she prefers "Mahogany-American". She immediately jokes that all the white people in the audience were probably looking around going "Did they change their name _again_!?"

    Comic Books 

-   _The Avengers_:
    -   Somewhat lampshaded during Kurt Busiek's run, where the team was forced to add at least one ethnic minority to its decidedly-white roster. Iron Man spends most of the issue complaining about how idiotic the notion of "diversity" is, while The Wasp feels crappy after realizing just how few minority members the team actually had up until that point. Thor and Captain America are also shown to be deeply angry and frustrated over the issue, believing that the Avengers should base their recruitment on actual talent, ability, competence, teamwork and dedication and not on ethnicity. Thor even goes so far as to ask "What does the color of a man's skin have to do with the content of his heart?"
    -   A much earlier issue from the 1980s had a similar set-up, but with a much more negative message. Hawkeye is unfairly kicked off the team in favor of The Falcon (an African American), and Falcon ultimately quits because he hates the idea of only being asked to join the Avengers to serve as the Token Minority.
-   For a brief period in _X-Factor,_ humans were known as "genetically challenged" or "geecees" for short. The character who coined the phrase was being funny, but it still caught on...

-   The character Carla Cortez represents this trope in the independent comic _Druid City_. Carla is a leftist Straw Feminist who campaigns to change the meaning of words or to discourage others from using them. She once lobbied to changed the name of Asperger's Syndrome, and protests that female cockroaches should be renamed vaginaroaches. She often chooses to support these causes to the detriment of more pressing leftist causes.
-   The Dutch series _De Familie Doorzon_ regularly has fun with this. When you have a family consisting of on one side a conservative right-wing father and his Surinam-born son-in-law, and on the other side a tree-hugging stuck-in-the-seventies left-wing mother, an overly sensitive gay son and a Drop-In Character who's been filling all kinds of New Age roles it's difficult not to. In one joke they try to redefine the Saint Nicholas tradition to be "non-racist" (Black Pete is now an "allochtonous compagnion"), non-denominational ("Friend Nicholas" instead of Saint Nicholas), environmentally friendly (uses a water-bike instead of a steam boat) and non-repressive (naughty kids don't get punished but receive "intensive guidance").
-   One of the early issues of the _Heroes Reborn_ _Avengers_ series has a scene where a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent mentions that there are some people who are upset with the lack of racial diversity in the Avengers line-up. Nick Fury scoffs at this and proceeds to insult anyone who would actually hold such an opinion, even though diversity continues to be a hot button issue in comics to this day.
-   An issue of _Justice League International_ had Black Canary chastise a Manhunter android by saying that it should have changed its name to "Personhunter", which would have been gender neutral.
-   One of the _Ultimate Avengers_ mini-series has a scene where the second Black Widow refers her teammate Tyrone as an "African-American", despite the fact that he comes from England. War Machine points this out and says that there's nothing offensive about calling him black, but Widow states that it still makes her uncomfortable and asks if "African-English" would be more appropriate.
-   In _Hawkeye_ 17, Clint Barton has a dream based on the fictional _Winter Friends_ cartoon, starring superheroes based on winter holidays: Yaldog, Santalope, Menorable, Kwanzaagator, Rama-in-Pajamas, and Samantha Hain, the Pagan Princess. The _Winter Friends_ theme song goes: "Wintertime's the best/Better than the rest/Snowball fights, shining lights, and multidenomnational, pantheistic, all-inclusive seasonal fests."
-   In the Polish comic _Górsky & Butch_, the main characters end up in medieval times and are accused of being "black mages" (Polish: _czarnoksiężnicy_). Gorsky (the black one) complains that it's racist, while a footnote states that, in politically correct language, the proper word would be _afroksiężnicy_ (literally, "afro-mages"; a pun on the word _Afroamerykanie_, "African-Americans").

    Comic Strips 

-   An old strip from _The Wizard of Id_ had the King of Id threatening to imprison anyone caught telling ethnic jokes. When one of his guards quips "We don't have a Chinaman's chance of making that stick," the next panel shows said guard in the dungeon.
-   _Bloom County_ did this now and then; there were strips where characters accused Band-Aid and Crayola for being involved in White Supremacist conspiracies, because their "racially insensitive" flesh-colored bandages and crayons were only "flesh-colored" from a Caucasian's point of view.
-   This _Pearls Before Swine_ Sunday strip has Goat mentioning the phrase "It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings", something that lands him in hot water with the "Word Police". After the lawyer indicates the offensive points of the phrase (Fat=Body-Shaming; Lady=Sexist; Sings\=Italian Opera Reference, Probably Racist), Goat is sent to the "Desert of Professional Ostracism Re-Education Camp". Then, he is allowed to do it all again, saying "I am accepting of all the world's wondrous diversity", which is "Humor Approved by the Word Police".

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The movie _PCU_ is a Wacky Fratboy Hijinx film set against the backdrop of a I-can't-believe-it's-not-Wesleyan college where everybody protests everything. The movie's climax actually had the students _protest that they were not going to protest_.
-   Parodied in _Undercover Brother_; the all-black B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D organisation has exactly one white employee, Lance (who is stereotypically "white" — i.e nerdy, uncool and lame), who only has his job there because of affirmative action. He's often heard complaining about their politically incorrect attitudes towards _him_.
    
    **Lance:** Always trying to shut the white man down.  
    **Conspiracy Brother:** THAT'S RIGHT! That's Right!... Oh, that ain't right.
    
-   In _The Ladykillers (2004)_, one of the characters (a foul-mouthed, "gangsta" black teen) is fired for hitting on a female customer. When he hears he's fired, he says his boss is doing it because he's black. The entire cleaning staff is black, and the guy doesn't fall for it until they bribe him.
-   In Dmitry Puchkov's Gag Dub of _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of The King_, Arwen insists on calling elves "Elven-Americans" to be PC. Elrond immediately corrects it to "Elven-Newzealander", considering where the movie was filmed.
-   In the French film _Le Placard_ (_The Closet_), a salaryman learns that he's about to be downsized. On the advice of his neighbor, he allows "proof" that he's gay (he's not) to reach his office, reasoning that the bosses will never dare to fire an employee who's just been outed, because it would look like discrimination.
-   In _RoboCop 2_, RoboCop is revamped to be a more politically-correct role model by having over two hundred directives installed in his brain to teach "pro-social" messages (as defined by a committee). It made him incapable of stopping a crime in progress because he was compelled to morally educate the criminals first. Naturally, the criminals simply continued doing what they were doing during his speech and made off with their loot. This may or may not be a Take That! towards the reaction real-world Moral Guardians had towards the first movie.
-   _Hot Fuzz_
    -   Sgt. Angel is such a By-the-Book Cop that he constantly interrupts his fellow officers to insert correct terminology ("police service" because "police force" is too aggressive, "staffing" instead of "manpower" because it's not fair to the female police, et cetera)
    -   Inverted with his use of "traffic _collision_" instead of "accident" since "accident implies there's no one to blame".
    -   And towards the end of the film, he lightens up when "staffing" is brought up, and makes an off-color comment about the female police officer "enjoying a bit of manpower." It should be noted that this officer had been making off-color comments in reference to herself the whole movie, and laughingly calls Angel a "cheeky monkey/dirty bastard."
    -   Also parodied with the Sanford Police Station's swearbox, where the list of words the coppers have to pay to say is bowdlerized with asterisks, except for the worst of them.
-   In _Brüno (2009)_, Sacha Baron Cohen trolls a black talk show audience by, among other things, describing Africa as being full of "African-Americans" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and, when corrected, insisting that "Africans" is an offensive term.
-   _Demolition Man_ takes place in a strange future where everything improper has been completely scrubbed out of society, including anything that could possibly be offensive or harmful. This includes guns, sex, swearing, booze, caffeine, contact sports, chocolate, meat products and non-educational children's toys.
-   _Blackboard Jungle_ has the teacher of a notoriously troublemaking class demonstrate how hurtful their use of slurs can be. One of the students then tries to get him in trouble by reporting him for using those words in class, deliberately leaving out the context. Luckily, the teacher is quickly believed when he explains the truth.
-   Lampshaded in _Muppet Treasure Island_ when referring to "Blind Pew".
    
    **Rizzo:** He's some kind of blind fiend!  
    **Gonzo:** I believe they prefer "visually challenged fiend"...
    
-   Zoey from _The Dictator_. Throughout the film, she frequently challenges Aladeen's views on women and other minorities, but there are several instances where she misunderstands genuine concern about his behaviour as racism.
    
    **Zoey, introducing herself:** _"This is my store. This is a free earth collective. We are a vegan, feminist, non-profit cooperative operating within an anti-racist, anti-oppressive framework for people of all or no genders."_
    

    Literature 

-   Kurt Vonnegut:
    -   In the short story _Harrison Bergeron_ parodies the (perceived) attitudes of equality activists. It takes place in a future dystopia where everyone has been made equal by handicapping devices which curtail excess intelligence, strength, creativity, beauty, or any other natural advantage (and if you had an unnatural advantage, such as skill due to training, you were only allowed to use it to make yourself average). There's even a government official (The "Handicapper General") whose job is to oversee this. She's fond of using shotguns as a tool of equality. The TV movie had a similar take. The government remakes the world to look like the 1950s (because that's when Americans are thought to have been happiest); the death penalty is enforced—on live television—for crimes like jaywalking; in schools, you fail if you score too low... but also if you score too high; you're supposed to be embarrassed if you beat someone in chess too easily... And people are in favor of all this. One government official (in order to rule, of course, they must be free of the devices that inhibit them) explains to Harrison in a borderline non-sequitur that while this has resulted in a marked decline in, for example, the arts, if it had meant an end to atrocities like what happened in World War II, he would put the gun to Beethoven's temple (they were listening to Beethoven while watching footage of World War II) himself. Whether Vonnegut was parodying the attitudes of equality activists or those of the people who complain about such efforts is a matter of debate, since both sides are presented as part of the War On Straw
    -   In _The Sirens of Titan_, the Church of God the Utterly Indifferent has people handicap themselves so that everybody is equal—for instance, a good runner always carries a heavy bag to slow him down, or somebody with good eyesight wears glasses that nearly blind him.
-   In the atheist-ruled world of _Soon_ by Jerry Jenkins, Christmas has been replaced by 'Wintermas'. Apparently Jenkins felt that having 'Christ' in the world would have offended the Straw Atheist world government but the word 'mas(s)' is left untouched.
-   _Discworld_
    -   Some novels feature the Campaign for Equal Heights, who protest about using terms like "short weight", and insist employers should hire three dwarfs for every two humans because humans are half again as tall. Most of their campaigners are human; dwarfs are baffled by the whole thing. (And if they _do_ feel insulted by humans, they can make their feelings quite clear without any help, except possibly a battleaxe. Generally, though, a dwarf will answer such insults by outworking a human, making better stuff, getting more money, and buying his business out from under him.)
    -   There is also at least one human who has renamed himself Strong-in-the-arm and cranked up his prices because "Dwarf Made" is a synonym for quality. The Campaign for Equal Heights can't complain because it would require them to draw attention to his height as a disqualifying point.
    -   There are also the "differently alive" (_not_ "undead") like vampires (hereditary) and banshees, not the same as "living impaired" for those who have died but are still walking around, or "vitally challenged" (_not_ "dead") persons. Except in rare instances that those who have died and _aren't_ walking around are considered lazy by people who should really know better (Reg Shoe, mostly). There was also, for a brief time, a group of humans who wanted to protect troll rights. Trolls never joined, because they thought they already had plenty of rights, what with being multi-ton masses of living stone.
-   In _Goblet of Fire_ and continuing on afterward, Hermione founds S.P.E.W. in order to free the house elves from slavery. The majority of the characters roll their eyes at this, suggesting that Hermione is taking it too far. It's later revealed that even the elves are against it, since they enjoy serving others. Dobby later tells Hermione that the house elves appreciate her sentiment and that she's thinking of their well-being, but what they don't appreciate is that she was trying to _trick_ them into accepting clothing against their will, making them regard her as something of a Well-Intentioned Extremist.
    -   Latter subverted when it's suggested that the S.P.E.W. ideals motivated some house-elves to participate in the Battle of Hogwarts, and Harry attempting to be nice to Kreacher prompts the elf to tell him about the location of a horcrux. It's implied that Hermione has shifted her stance over time, however, as her understanding of the house-elf psyche has improved—she isn't calling for Harry to free Kreacher (as she might have in the previous two books, especially _Phoenix_); rather, she merely suggests that Harry treat Kreacher well.
-   A story by Connie Willis called _Ado_, in which a high school student was trying to get her fellow classmates to read Shakespeare's plays while increasingly bizarre censorship blanked out the text entirely. For example, one group got Polonius's death in Hamlet censored because "curtains don't kill people, people kill people." Moreover Interflora wanted the scene where Ophelia is gathering flowers removed because it reflected badly on flowers. In the end only the very first scene between the guards complaining about the cold night was left. It was short some lines to boot.
-   _Incompetence_ by Rob Grant is set in a future United States of Europe where (based on actual laws proposed in France) it is illegal to discriminate against candidates for employment not only on the grounds of gender, age, race or creed, but on _actual ability to do the job_, with predictable results.

-   A trio of "children's books" called _Politically Correct Bedtime Stories_ take this trope and run wild with it, to the point of parody and turning the old classics into something new and amusing in their own right. Ant and the Grasshopper? Ant gets arrested for illegal stockpiling. Princess and the Pea? The "Princess" turns out to be a medium who channels many different spirits, which makes for interesting mealtimes at the castle. Little Mermaid? The rescued prince ends up getting a genetic procedure done so that he becomes half-man, half-prawn, instead of her going to live up with him. And then there was the "Politically Correct Alphabet"...
-   Though this is never explicitly stated, it's likely that this played a role in the development of the Utopia Justifies the Means society of _The Giver_. Even _color_ is eliminated. Not just skin color — _all_ color except black, grey and white. And couples don't actually reproduce through intercourse, but are assigned exactly two children (children are born to specifically designated Birth Mothers who are never seen) and every citizen begins taking medication during puberty to suppress "the Stirrings".
-   The events in Philip Roth's _The Human Stain_ are set in motion by this trope. The protagonist, Coleman Silk, is a college professor and after noticing that two students have not appeared for any of his lectures, asks his class "Does anyone know these people? Do they exist or are they spooks?". As it turns out, both of the missing students are black _and_ "spook" is not only a term for "ghost" or "spy", but also a racial slur. Coleman then quits his job at the college amidst unfair accusations of racism, which is ironic, since, unbeknownst to most characters, he is black himself, albeit very light-skinned. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   There is a story called _The Highest Treason_ by Randall Garrett on a future human society where you cannot say that one man can be better than another in _anything_, promotion is strictly according to age, and that society is quickly losing a war against aliens. So, the protagonist, as a desperate patriot, joins the enemy, helps them conquer a planet, and slaughters the people there, showing humanity that one person can be ''worse'' than another. In the end, humanity is victorious, and their philosophy is now that one man cannot be better than another in _everything,_ but everybody is better than the rest of humanity at _something_.
-   The backstory of _Fahrenheit 451_ gives this as the reason for the censorship and banning of virtually all printed literature. Word of God states his point was television dumbing down people too much so they banned books because thinking become too strenuous.
-   The second _Odd Thomas_ book, _Forever Odd_, has a hand in this. The Pico Mundo high school football team used to be called the Braves. Someone got it into their head that this offended the Native Americans in the area and so the school was forced to change their name to the Gila Monsters. They call themselves the Monsters, though, saving some embarrassment. The really stupid thing about this? _None of the Indians were complaining._ Truth in Television since most of the complaints for Indians aren't made by Indians. In fact, when the Smithsonian "Museum of the American Indian" opened, a petition quickly pulled up to change it to "Native American". It was quashed by a request from none other than the Muscogee High Chief.
-   Acheron, the villain of the _Thursday Next_ novel _The Eyre Affair_, insists he's _differently moraled_.
-   In the Swedish YA novel _Omin Hammbe i Slättköping_, Omin (a black kid, in fact the only kid in town who isn't purely ethnic Swedish) performs a prank with two friends at school. When he is exempt from punishment because the headmaster is afraid of looking racist, he gets very angry because the treatment is racist in itself: is the headmaster saying he can't be hold responsible for what he does because he is black (i.e., he's stupid)? That he cannot take detention because he is from Africa? He insists on going through with detention.
-   Spoofed in a Harry Potter parody series named _Barry Trotter_. When Barry receives an ugly pair of pajamas from his children on his birthday, he comments to himself that they are "Gay with a side order of retarded." A footnote then adds: Or to be more politically correct, "These pajamas practice an alternative lifestyle and have special needs."
-   In Kage Baker's _The Company Novels_, in the future alcohol, tobacco, sugar, chocolate, meat, fish, dairy... pretty much everything even remotely "bad for you" or involving possible discomfort to any animal, is illegal. Sex is being phased out as well.
-   In Michael Flynn's _The January Dancer_, Donovan uses this ironically, addressing a rock — excuse me, Silicon Based Lifeform.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_
    -   A large banner in the Magic Shop reminds everyone that Christmas, Winter Solstice, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa & Gurnenthar's Ascendance are coming.
    -   In "Pangs", several characters (most notably Willow) are ambivalent about fighting a Native American spirit seeking revenge due to the atrocities committed against his people, despite the fact that he's _killing_ innocent people who had nothing to do with said atrocities. It takes an epic The Reason You Suck speech from Spike to goad them into action.
    -   Buffy is arguing with Angel, saying she can't trust him because he's a vampire. When Angel takes offense, she snarks, "I'm sorry, should I have said Undead American?"
    -   Ethan Rayne is giving the We Used to Be Friends speech to Giles, who points out that Ethan now worships Chaos. Ethan replies, "Oh, religious intolerance."
    -   Buffy's Watcher informs her she can't leave Sunnydale to go to college, being The Chosen One. Buffy whines, "You can't just define me by my Slayerness! That's... Something-ism."
-   _Angel_
    
    -   Wesley once appeared with a black eye after saving a pair of power walkers from being devoured by a Hacklar demon. The injury wasn't inflicted by the demon.
    
    **Wesley**: Apparently she felt I'd disrespected the Hacklar's culture by killing it.
    
    -   In the fifth season Harmony proves to be extremely accepting of cultural differences, arguing in defense of a cultural imperative to dismember virgins, and bringing a live camel into the office so Angel could slaughter it and offer pieces of it to their clients. Of course, she doesn't have a soul.
    -   Season one had an episode called "Sense and Sensitivity" which gleefully parodied this trope. A demon used magic to cause the L.A.P.D. to become politically correct beyond the point of lunacy, not only in order to control them, but to cause general mayhem. In a day, all the police are "sharing their feelings", that is, babbling incoherently and pathetically about all the injustice and pain in the world, and showing weakness and an aversion to violence in front of hardened criminals. The entire precinct is almost overrun.
    -   Then we have Angel's own Berserk Button regarding the politically correct attitude thinking that vampires sleep in coffins - it's actually an offensive stereotype that seemingly originated solely from Dracula's own weirdness, and doesn't remotely apply to anyone else.
-   In an episode of _All in the Family_, Archie did this intentionally. When a black man said that Hispanic people tended to avoid birth control, Archie responded, "Well ain't that the black calling the kettle pot?"
-   _Scrubs_:
    
    -   There was an episode where Elliot had apparently been practically assaulted for singing "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" at a karaoke, and outright told she, as a white person, could never try to sing that song. At the end of the episode she does again and is given a murderous look by a black doctor.
    -   Another episode featured JD on a first date with his new girlfriend (who is black). During the date they end up at the hospital and JD orders a resident to do something trivial before laughing about it...
    
    **JD**: It's so great because the residents are practically our slaves.  
    **In JD's head**: Ah! I just said "slave" to my new, black girlfriend!
    
    -   A similar thing occurs when Turk's brother comes to visit, and he makes Turk sleep on the couch while he takes Turk's bed, justifying it because he paid for Turk's medical school.
    
    **JD:** We should, like, make him be our personal slave.
    
    **Turk's Brother:** Our personal what now?
    
    **JD:** Uh, I didn't mean-
    
    **Turk's Brother:** How about this? How about he be the house slave, and I be the field slave. That sound like fun to you?
    
    **JD:** No, that doesn't sound fun at all.
    
    **Turk:** What's going on?
    
    **Turk's Brother:** I forgot how much fun it was messing with Alfalfa here!
    
    -   In another episode, Dr. Cox's black friend angrily tells JD, who uses the word "black" that that correct term is "African-American". The confused and a little scared JD tries to tell him that Turk lets him use such terms with him, only for the guy to loudly wonder who this Turk guy is. After JD runs away, Cox congratulates his friend on using the "angry black guy" act, and the guy immediately drops it.
-   _30 Rock_
    
    -   In one episode, Liz discovered that she simply could not tell her black date that she disliked him as a person without being Mistaken for Racist. At the end of the episode, the following conversation is set to inspirational music:
    
    **Liz**: Can't one human being not like another human being? Can't we all just not get along?  
    **Steven**: Liz, I wish it could be like that. And maybe someday our children or our children's children will hate each other like that, but it just doesn't work that way today.  
    **Liz**: So what you're saying is that any woman that doesn't like you is a racist.  
    **Steven**: No, no, no, no, no. Some women are gay.
    
    -   In an episode with Salma Hayek, her character says that she is Puerto Rican, which Jack thinks is an ethnic slur ("No, I know you can say that, but what do I call you?") Multiple characters comment that it "just sounds wrong".
-   In the first episode of _My Name Is Earl_, Earl refers to a gay man as "gay", then to avoid offending him follows up with, "Sorry... Homosexual-American?"
-   _A Touch of Frost_:
    -   Detective Frost wincing every time he accidentally uses a phrase like 'keeping in the black' in front of his black coworker. She eventually tells him that he doesn't need to alter the English language for her.
    -   Another episode has Frost make racist comments about a new black officer, but only when Mullet is around. Just to screw with him.
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_:
    -   Thoroughly parodied in the episode _SantaClaus_ with the song, "Merry Christmas... If That's Okay". Completely subverted in the actual episode, with Santa's multicultural montage of his helpers.
    -   Also parodied in _Track of the Moon Beast_:
        
        Paul: I just blacked out.
        
        Mike: Uhh, excuse me, you _African-Americaned_ out.
        
-   An episode of _The Thin Blue Line_ parodied this, with Fowler ordered to get everyone at the station up to standard on political correctness. He makes a series of embarrassingly awful attempts to express enlightened views about race, gender and sexuality: "That would be the pot calling the kettle ... er ... African-American!" Even more absurd in that the series is set in Britain.
-   _Community_
    -   The main schtick of Dean Pelton (aside from being not-so Ambiguously Gay) is going overboard with political correctness. In the first Christmas episode he dresses up as "Non-Denominational Mr. Winter" and wishes people a "Merry Happy" and in the second, the college has designated "religious expression zones" with Christmas trees and menorahs cordoned off with yellow tape.
    -   In an attempt to create a school mascot with no features anyone could identify as stereotypically of a specific race, they ended up with a grey skinned, Uncanny Valley dwelling horror known as the Greendale Human Being."<small>◊</small>
    -   The Series Finale, which had each character pitching their idea for a hypothetical Season 7, showed that even the Dean has his limits on political correctness when Britta's pitch erases almost his entire personality for the sake of turning him into a token transgender character.
-   One MacGruber skit involved MacGruber being sent to learn about being racially sensitive after accidentally insulting an assistant, an African-American guy. MacGruber takes it so much to heart, he can't even say the names of _colors_ like black or yellow (an insulting name for Asian people). Unfortunately, that's not the end of it.
-   The sketch-comedy _Almost Live!_ did a lot of good-natured sending up of political correctness, especially as it related to Seattle's liberal reputation and culture. One such sketch is linked here.
-   _No Reservations, Ace of Cakes,_ and _Dirty Jobs_ did Generic Holiday Episodes; Anthony Bourdane and Mike Rowe did endless lampshading. When Duff & Co. made a cake for _No Reservations_'s holiday feast, they included all the holiday symbols.
-   When Dick discovered white guilt on _3rd Rock from the Sun_: "Angel food cake is white, devil's food cake black! Who gets to make the first move in chess? The white guys!"
-   From _Seinfeld_

-   The "The Cigar Store Indian" episode has Jerry insulting his Native American girlfriend with the eponymous item, and spending the rest of the episode struggling with things like telling her he made a "reservation" at a restaurant. He offends an Asian mailman by asking where a good Chinese restaurant is, not noticing he was Chinese at first and figuring that as a mailman he'd know the neighborhood. She eventually dumps him when she gives him something and then tries to take it back and he stops himself a little too late from calling her an Indian giver.
-   Episode The Outing. A reporter overhears Elaine joking about Jerry and George being gay. The spend the rest of the episode vehemently denying being gay, but always interceding with "Not that there's anything wrong with that."

-   _X-Play_ wishes all of its viewers a "Happy Non-Denominational Winter Season". The winter shows with this theme tend to depict the hosts with a forced air of polite cheer and vodka in place of their cocoa.
-   _The Daily Show_:
    -   In one segment where Jon spoke to two people on his news team: Al Madrigal and Jessica Williams. The two of them said they felt sorry for white men because they actually have to work hard in order to become successful, while minorities like the two of them don't have to do any work at all and just get everything handed to them through affirmative action. Jessica said that as a black woman, she is particularly privileged. All she has to do is mail a picture of herself to a university and they mail her back a diploma.
    -   Also parodied in a Running Gag regarding a scandal involving a vacation home presidential candidate Rick Perry used to frequent (which was called Niggerhead)- Jon was not allowed to say it, so he had to play a clip of black presidential candidate Herman Cain saying it instead.
-   An unfortunate case in _Malcolm in the Middle_, in which Malcolm is reported for using "The R word," the joke being that it's impossible to tell what the word actually is. Trouble is, since the episode aired, "retard" has been designated as an offensive slur.
-   Episode 3 of _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_ has a scene where Santiago is speaking to a group of at-risk teens, and does an impression of a drug dealer. When one of the kids disgustedly asks why her impression sounds like a black kid, she quickly asserts that her fictional drug dealer is _not_ black, at which point Gina then asks Santiago why she thinks black people are too incompetent to sell drugs.
-   _That Mitchell and Webb Look_:
    -   The show had sketches starring the incredibly offensive superhero Captain Todger, who is about every kind of -ist as well as an all-round tosser (literally, according to him) fighting against the supervillain General Drayfox, who is his perfect foil and, hence, embodies this trope wholeheartedly.
        
        **General Drayfox:** Let him kneel before me! _Unless_ of course he is an orthodox Jew and has an issue with kneeling for religious reasons, in which case I'll be happy for him to pay his obeisance in whatever way he finds culturally appropriate. Muahahahaha!
        
    -   In another episode, a behind-the-scenes moment after a sketch revealing David Mitchell wearing a burka had Robert Webb worriedly musing about whether they were on the right side of political correctness. As he was removing the burka, David reassured him that he was overthinking things... only to reveal that he was wearing black-face under the burka.
-   _Corner Gas_: Davis is sent to sensitivity training for telling Dumb Blonde jokes around Karen (who is blonde), and comes back so politically correct that Karen immediately finds him insufferable and wants him to go back to the way he was. For example, when Karen orders black coffee, Davis corrects her by saying "African-American!". The show isn't even set in America.
-   In an early episode of _Spin City_, Carter added an autocorrect to the office's word processors to replace "Black" with "African American"; this results in invitations being mailed out for an "African American Tie Dinner."
-   The _Key & Peele_ sketch "Offensive Boss" features a middle-aged white male executive calling three employees — an African American man, a woman and a gay man — into his office and asking them to vet a speech he's planning to deliver in order to ensure that there's no offensive material included. Each of them turns out to be hyper-critical and manages to find problematic implications in everything he says — before he even manages to get to the speech ("I don't need a man's permission to raise my hand!"). Finally, in frustration, he asks them to at least allow him to read his speech to them, which begins with a clearly offensive joke about a "Chinaman, a Polack and an Arab" — but because none of the three employees fall into those categories, they find it hilarious.
-   _The Other Two_ parodies it with the titular play in "Cary & Brooke Go to an AIDS Play". It is an extremely long and nonsensical play that jumps between time periods and takes forever to even mention AIDS. Nobody wants to criticize it or leave because it will make them look homophobic and dismissive of the important cause that is HIV. By the third night, the audience members are all openly asleep.

    Music 

-   "Happy Christmahanavaloween" by Melanie Safka:
    
    One greeting card to cover everything
    
    Confusing yes, no one will guess
    
    We left out Kwanzaa!
    
-   The Capitol Steps parodied "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" as "You Don't Bring Me Floriculturally Diverse Polyfragrant Soilistically Challenged Multipetaled Victims of Pesticidal Food Chain Chauvinism," in which the stamen is renamed "stay-person."
-   Stan Freberg did this back in 1957, when he sang (purportedly at the insistence of a Moral Guardian) "_Elderly_ Man River"\[1\], with political correctness and proper grammar and pronunciation — i.e., ridiculously Bowdlerized.
    
    He doesn't plant taters — _potatoes_  
    He doesn't plant cotton — _cotting_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>   
    And them's — _these_ — _those_ that plant them  
    Are soon forgotting...
    
    -   Upon coming to the "you get a little drunk, and you land in..." line he gives up.
-   "Alternative Tango" by Victoria Wood, in which she comes up with a number of different euphemism for her insult of choice, which has now been banned.
-   A Capella group Straight No Chaser's "Christmas Can-Can"; in the second verse one singer complains, "It's not fair if you're Jewish," and then breaks into the Dreidel Song("Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay,"). During the second verse he flatly states, "I'm gonna go get some Chinese food", before the other singers include him in their song, wishing him a happy Hanukkah(and merry Kwanzaa to their African-American singer).
    -   Amusingly enough the "Token Jewish Guy" Walter Chase is the one who wrote the song.
-   "Uncle Dave's Grace" by Lou and Peter Berryman has the titular character asked to say grace at Thanksgiving dinner, and proceeding to bring everyone down by lamenting all the ways in which the holiday, and modern civilization in general, is a product of exploitation and ecological devastation.
    
    We felt so guilty when he was all through  
    It seemed there was one of two things we could do  
    Live without food in the nude in a cave  
    Or next year have someone say grace besides Dave
    
-   _An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer_: The song "It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier" describes a variety of incompetent and inappropriate recruits Lehrer supposedly encountered during a stint in the Army. In the spoken introduction, he remarks:
    
    One of the many fine things one has to admit is the way that the Army has carried the American democratic ideal to its logical conclusion, in the sense that not only do they prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race, creed, and color, but also on the grounds of ability.
    

    Radio 

-   This 2013 story from the CBC Radio news-parody program _This Is That_ involves a spokeswoman for a fictional protest group that wants to ban the phrase "happy holidays", on the grounds that it offensively assumes that the recipient is both happy and on holiday.
-   In an episode of _John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme_, a zookeeper complains that giving the sloths motorbikes is political correctness gone mad. When John questions what it has to do with political correctness, she replies "Nothing. That's why it's gone mad. Normally people use 'political correctness gone mad' to mean 'political correctness I don't agree with'. But if political correctness has given a sloth a motorbike, it has _actually_ gone mad."

    Theater 

-   _The Complete History Of America Abridged_ includes a politically correct version of "America the Beautiful." Among other alterations to the lyrics, "America" becomes "non-Eurocentric bio-region," and "God" is replaced with "non-theologically specific supreme being (if she exists)."

    Video Games 

-   _Sunset Overdrive_: Smartphone #13 contains an email whose humorously long and multi-word "To" line is "Fizzco\_ScienceGuys\_(andgirlstobePC)". PC stands for "Politically Correct".
-   When _Richard Garriott's Tabula Rasa_ was still running, it featured this trope for the holiday season. The AFS referred to it as "Seasonal Holiday Observance" or SHO, where major military bases would sport a "Festive Seasonal Holiday Observance Flora" (Christmas tree), under which soldiers could find "Holiday Hats" (a Santa Claus hat). The political correctness was probably tongue-in-cheek given the overblown military acronym style of the names.
-   In _Kingdom of Loathing_, this was Mr. Mination's fatal flaw: He refused to wear the Monarch of Crimbo's hat, since the color red is offensive to the colorblind, and the fur trim is offensive to naked mole rats. If you choose to fight Uncle Crimbo and win, he throws that hat on the ground, allowing Uncle Crimbo to take it, get his power back, and split Mr. Mination back into his composite elves.

    Webcomics 

-   _Bobwhite_: During her senior year, Cleo suddenly realizes that she's the only privileged white person in her circle of friends, so she begins apologizing to all her non-WASP friends for any hypothetical times she may have unintentionally oppressed them. Her friends just find it annoying.
-   _Sinfest_ shows us the power of positive thinking: "Victory-challenged", "virtue intolerant", "nutritional over-achiever". On several occasions, Slick can also be seen at the appropriately named "Politically Incorrect Cafe", which is Exactly What It Says on the Tin.
-   Kankri from _Homestuck_, as a parody of Tumblr and the Overly Narrow Superlative sect of the LGBT community, overly defines every potential facet of his caste system and tries way too hard to make sure nothing he says offends anyone in the slightest, often asking people for a detailed list of what would offend them before going into one of his monologues. He seems to be blissfully unaware that his attitude comes off as incredibly sexist and bigoted to his friends. It gets to his point where he actually criticizes a mentally-ill person who falls down a lot and has poor coordination for wearing a helmet on the grounds that it implies that all of the mentally-ill should be forced to wear helmets. Another character suggests that his political correctness is just a ruse to get away with backhandedly talking about his friends's flaws to their faces.
    -   He's also completely failed to notice that his entire society now consists of twelve trolls, and most of them really don't give a damn about the subjects of his speeches. Of course, he may just be ignoring this as it would refute his right to talk on and on at length.
    -   This goes so far that Karkat (of all people) reflects that, by just shouting everything he thinks in everybody's faces riddled with expletives, he is not just a more honest, but also a more respectful person - he actually tells people what he thinks.

-   In an early Stan the Crow strip by _Granitoons_, the cartoonist censors anything that sets bad examples to the readers including Stan's corncob which promotes thievery and Farmer Giles' shotgun which promotes violence.
-   _Errant Story_ takes a potshot at this, in the sequence where Sarine is explaining about the four elven races — which goes over with Ellis about as well as one would expect it to.
    
    **Ellis:** Wouldn't it be easier to call them by stuff that makes sense, like "High Elves," "Wood Elves," "Sea Elves," "Cave Elves"...  
    **Sarine:** ... What?  
    **Ellis:** No... "cave elves" sounds kinda stupid. How about "Dark Elves"? "Night Elves"? "Black Elves"? "Angry, Disenfranchised Minority Elves"? On second thought, go back to calling them by unpronounceable crap.
    

    Web Original 

-   Extremely Decent hilariously spoofed this trope in the aptly titled "That's Offensive". It began with the poker players only being offended by things that many people are offended by (such as the derogatory word "Retarded"), but it quickly got to the point where someone would rant about something they found offensive, only to offend someone else the moment they finished their sentence.
    
    **Dog:** \*barks\*  
    **Guys:** THAT'S OFFENSIVE!
    
-   _ClickHole_ does this, with articles written in the style of Buzzfeed and Upworthy, which are criticized for being patronizing and preachy. For example, the satire article, "Let's Have an Open Dialogue About Sexuality That Completely Validates My Point Of View" paraodies what is seen as a flaw in many social justice movements by detractors; an unwillingness to consider other points of views on topics.
-   On _Homestar Runner_, resident Granola Girl Marzipan hosts a disturbingly politically correct school program called L.U.R.N. in the Strong Bad Email coloring. Students are referred to as "life-blossoms", classes are in a variety of environmentally conscious topics such as "eco-algebra" and "talking to animals", and coloring is done with crayons that have "politically correct" names (like "Crimson Suggestion" for "red") and can't actually be used to color, "so that no one life-blossom shines brighter than any other".
-   In _Red vs. Blue_, Andy is a sentient bomb, and Caboose tells everyone to refer to him as an "Explosive-American".
    -   Don't even get Doc started with this. Any time anyone says anything that could possibly be construed as offensive toward anyone at all, he jumps in with the inane politically correct version. Most notable in one of the holiday specials, where he constantly corrects even himself.
    -   Sarge, of course, would have nothing to do with it. It doesn't work out well for him.

-   Speaking of _World of Warcraft_, _The original Scourge Chat Log_ had a spider "discriminated against on the basis of his spinal condition" (he hasn't got one).
    
    **\[BlizzardRep\]**: Phylumism, were it an actual thing, would go against everything we stand for as a corporation.
    
    **\[An00b’arak\]**: yes thats what ive been saying thank you thank you
    
    **\[An00b’arak\]**: >8< >8> <8< <8> >8< spider priiiiiide
    
-   Those statements are "lactose intolerant". And not in _that_ sense.
-   From a deleted article on Wikipedia: _Huperprogeny_, a "politically correct" term for _Human_ ("man"->"person", "son"->"progeny").
-   _Auralnauts Star Wars_: Discussed. Mr. Palpatine thinks that Life Day is a pointless politically correct term for Christmas, and wants the Life Day Parade rebranded as the Christmas Parade. He ignores Vader's assertion that Life Day is an actual holiday and that the Alderaanians (whose memory the entire parade is dedicated to) didn't celebrate Christmas.
    
    **Palpatine:** What is this... Life Day nonsense about, anyway?  
    **Vader:** What?  
    **Palpatine:** Why are people afraid to just say Christmas?
    
-   The FanFiction Critic parodies this, in that every time a story she is reviewing misspells the interjection "Whoopie!" as "Woppie" or something along those lines, she will yell out "Hey! As an Italian-American, I find this very offensive!" as though the fanfic writer meant the ethnic slur instead.
-   Glove and Boots - Ten Terrible Lawn Decorations: "Redneck" is culturally offensive. But apparently, giving them a different label and then brutally stereotyping them as lawn slobs isn't.
    
    Fafa: Then what do I call them?!
    
    Mario: Gentlemen or women of the country music persuasion.
    
-   _Code Ment_ features a memorable scene where Suzaku refuses to save a woman from danger because he thinks it would be sexist to take part in the Damsel in Distress trope and declares that as a strong, independent woman she should be able to easily save herself. This despite the fact that said woman is blind, crippled from the waist down, and has a bomb strapped to her that will blow her head off if disarmed improperly. And than when Lelouch tells him to just ignore her gender and save her, Suzaku declares he won't do that because it's denying her sexual identity.
    
    **Lelouch**: **NOT IF HER HEAD EXPLODES!!!**
    
-   This animated video parodies the real-life phenomenon of stand-up comedians hesitating to perform in colleges due to the students getting angry at anything remotely offensive. Among the problems the white male protagonist faces are:
    -   Mentioning breaking up with his girlfriend, which apparently makes him a Heteronormative Crusader.
    -   Telling a joke about airplane food, which is unacceptable due to some members of the audience having fear of flying.
    -   Talking about the time he went on vacation in Jamaica (_"Racist!"_) with his dad (_"Patriarchist!"_).
    -   This is all _brilliantly_ tied together by the comedian being told that although he can't say any of the above, he's in a "safe space" where people are allowed to say whatever they wish.
-   Dan from the Game Grumps loves to do this, it doesn't matter the context or who said it, be it a real person or a character in a game.
    
    **Dan**: I don't like the way you said "black."
    
-   When _PatTheNESPunk_ reviews _Toki_, Donkey Kong Junior objects to a number of things Pat says as being insensitive to apes like himself.
    
    **Pat:** \[talking to the game\] Get away, you bouncing monkeys!  
    **D.K. Junior:** Again with the hate speech!  
    **Pat:** What did I say?  
    **D.K. Junior:** Do you know how offensive it is to use the "M word"?  
    **Pat:** The "M word"...what, _monkey_? But—but that _is_ a monkey! A green monkey!  
    **D.K. Junior:** Specieist! The "M word" is no longer acceptable to say. "Evolutionary challenged simian" is the preferred nomenclature.  
    **Pat:** When did _that_ change?  
    **D.K. Junior:** A few days ago.
    
-   Parodied in ''Social Justice Detective". Jack Stryker is a Cowboy Cop who investigates crimes related to social justice, but is constantly torn up about the fact that he is a straight white male and might fall to The Dark Side by becoming a stooge for the patriarchy.
-   Chris Ray Gun's "Social Justice the Musical" videos all focus on people getting very offended and angry over minor slights, with the songs serving as criticism of the concept. Though he makes references of real-events, things are exaggerated and fictionalized for the sake of parody.
-   This animated parody depicts "Social Justice Warriors" as a Justice League\-type group on a Saturday-Morning Cartoon show. Their members are comprised of the Bias Response Team, Antifa Freddy, and the Ethnic Enhancer, with goofy superpowers like fighting fascism with fascism or X-Ray Vision allowing them to see racism everywhere.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   In an episode, the kids bought ice cream from an ice cream van called "Native American Ice Cream (formerly Big Chief Crazy Cone)".
    -   In a latter-day episode, the school is segregated according to gender by a staunch feminist:
        -   Lisa is so disappointed with said feminist's "How do numbers make you feeeeeeeeel?" style of teaching (complete with light show) that she crossdresses herself into the boy school, which descended into chaos.
        -   A conversation from that episode:
            
            **Principal Skinner:** When I look in my closet, I don't see male clothes or female clothes. They're all the same.
            
            **Edna Krabappel:** Are you saying that men and women are identical?
            
            **Skinner:** Oh, no, of course not! Women are unique in every way.
            
            **Lindsey Naegle:** Now he's saying men and women _aren't_ equal!
            
            **Skinner:** No, no, no! It's the differences of which there are none that makes the sameness exceptional. Just tell me what to say!
            
        -   In the 90's flashback episode, Marge's college teacher Professor August is being consistently and obnoxiously politically correct about everything he says and does, going _way_ beyond an ordinary Soapbox Sadie. (When the New England Patriots are decisively beating the Washington Redskins on TV, he bursts into tears and calls the game a "genocide.")
        -   From _Treehouse of Horror VII_:
            
            **Dr. Hibbert:** Yes, I remember Bart's birth well. You don't forget a thing like Siamese Twins!
            
            **Lisa:** I believe they prefer to be called "conjoined twins".
            
            **Dr. Hibbert:** And Hillbillies prefer to be called "sons of the soil". But it ain't gonna happen.
            
-   _South Park_ does this one several times a season.
    -   Perhaps the biggest example is "Death Camp of Tolerance". Mr. Garrison learns that if he gets fired for being gay, he can sue the school for millions, so he tries to get fired on purpose by doing increasingly depraved sexual acts in front of his students, including bringing in his new assistant (and boyfriend), Mr. Slave. Mr. Garrison is horrified when he receives nothing but praise and applause for his "courage", while his students are berated as being "homophobic" for speaking up about it and sent to the titular Auschwitz-like Tolerance Camp. When Mr. Garrison actually receives an _award_ for his behaviour, he explodes with rage at his audience, saying that the kinds of things he has been doing are sick and should not be tolerated no matter who is doing them. Unfortunately he also accidentally lets slip his plan to sue the school, so the principal sends both him and Mr. Slave to the Tolerance Camp as punishment, claiming that they are Boomerang Bigots intolerant of their own homosexuality. Mr. Slave thinks it looks like fun.
        -   It was also subverted in the episode when, after having _just_ emerged from the Museum of Tolerance - where the boys were encouraged by the curator and their parents to be accepting of the life-choices of others - the curator yells at a smoker to go away (even though he was outside and away from the doors), with the parents joining in by calling him "dirty lungs", among other things.
    -   Additionally, in "With Apologies to Jesse Jackson", Randy Marsh (Stan's dad) gets hounded everywhere as "that Nigger Guy" because he accidentally used a racial epithet on national television, (A quick explanation of how- It was _Wheel of Fortune_, the bonus round, the clue was "People that annoy you" and the letters were N\_GGERS. The answer? Naggers.) even _after_ he literally kisses Jesse Jackson's ass while seeking forgiveness. This episode slowly turns into a subversion of the trope by the end, though, when Congress becomes so outraged by the oppression of Randy Marsh and others like him that they ban the epithet "Nigger Guy".
    -   "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" in which Mrs. Brofloski protests the school's Christmas play so that the school will remove the overtly Christian elements. The priest counter-protests that if they take Christ out of Christmas, they'll need to take out all the stuff about Santa Claus as well. They have to take down the Christmas tree due to objections by environmentalists and the lights because it may offend epileptics. One person even claims to be offended by mistletoe, though they don't explain why. So, what they get is an abstract avant-garde musical, with all the third graders prancing around in black unitards to ambient music and chanting. It's not received well, and the audience breaks out into a riot. At the end, Mr. Hankey delivers the Stock Aesop about how Christmas is about people being nice to each other and baking cookies. Cut to Jesus, alone in his TV studio, sadly singing "Happy Birthday to Me".
    -   In "Free Hat," Steven Spielberg announces a re-release of _Saving Private Ryan_, where the word "Nazis" is replaced with "persons with political differences."
    -   Another episode has Cartman throwing a rock at Token because he thought Token called him fat. Because Token is black, the police consider it a hate crime and put Cartman in juvie. The boys (including Token) get him pardoned with a presentation they call "Hate Crime Laws-A Vicious Hypocrisy" which "made more sense than any presentation I've heard all year" according to the governor.
    -   All of Season 19 is one big Take That! to internet "social justice warriors" and their motto of "no bad tactics, only bad targets", i.e. they use bullying, threats, violence, and public shaming in order to beat the wrongthink out of anyone who dares disagree with their ultra-progressive views. Freshly joining the cast in this season is the PC Principal. To put it bluntly, he is nothing short of the Anthropomorphic Personification of this trope.
        -   In "Sponsored Content", he threatens to break the legs of the editor of the school newspaper because the word "retarded" was used in an article. Then when he finds out Jimmy is the editor and has no problem with the word being used, PC Principal has no idea what to do about it.
        -   Much like the aforementioned "Death Camp of Tolerance" did before, an overarching theme in the season is the point to be made that while plenty of discriminatory views have no place in modern society, this culture of hyper-political correctness is less about actually fighting for the downtrodden and providing solutions to these problems inasmuch as it's more about people wanting to feel better about themselves and using political correctness as a tool to stroke their own shallow and fragile egos. And PC Principal, for all his thuggish ways, is shown to genuinely care for the cause (as shown when he expresses disgust at how his PC fraternity brothers use political correctness and progressive politics to look good in front of women).
    -   In the Bad Future of _South Park: Post Covid_, Jimmy's become a comedic Talk Show host but isn't allowed to tell any _actual_ jokes to avoid offending anyone. It becomes a Running Gag where he seemingly sets up to tell an offensive joke but replaces the punchline with a compliment.
-   In the _Sealab 2021_ episode "Article 4", nearly everyone on Sealab abuses the affirmative action policy to get promoted to Captain... except for Quinn, who's too proud and too sensible, Stormy, who's too stupid, Murphy (who's already captain), and Allen and the other Asians (whom Article 4 actually _discriminated_ against). Even a _dolphin_ and a _monkey_ got promotions.
-   _Pelswick_ had some examples of this. The title character, who uses a wheelchair, is often referred to as "differently able". In one episode he anonymously published a cartoon in the school paper that people objected to on the grounds that "differently able" people might be offended by it... and then blithely withdrew their complaints when it came out that Pelswick was the artist.
-   Lampshaded in _The Venture Brothers_ where Jefferson Twilight fights Blackulas for a living. When asked if he only fights African-American vampires, he responds "No, sometimes I fight British vampires, they don't _have_ African-Americans in England! ...Look, I specialize in hunting black vampires, I don't know what the PC name for that is." The stealth joke here is that he probably does it so that white vampire hunters don't get accused of being racist when they kill black vampires.
    
    -   The in-universe explanation is that Jefferson saw his mother be raped and killed by Blaculas when he was ten.
    
    **Doctor Orpheus**: Wow.
    
-   In an episode of _Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World_, the gang goes to San Francisco for Pride Week, only to be shunned by the rest of the gay population for being normal-acting gay people, rather than extreme stereotypes. Also, the introduction to the Mayor's Welcome Speech lasts the entire episode, as he is sure to include the politically correct term for every sexual preference imaginable.
-   A _Robot Chicken_ sketch involving the Creature from the Black Lagoon had the creature state that they preferred to be called the Creature from the African-American Lagoon.
-   In an episode of _WordGirl_, Becky's family hosts a 'Holiday' party, where everyone brings their 'Holiday' cheese (which of course, Dr. Two-Brains steals). The thing is... Well, there's Christmas trees and all that, not really any sign of any OTHER holiday; and they even sing "Oh, Holiday Cheese," which has the exact tune as "O, Christmas Tree." The episode is named, "Oh, Holiday Cheese." Mr. Botsford also makes a reference to "The Christmas Song": "I'm gonna roast some nuts. And I'm gonna do it over an open fire!" There is a slight chance that all this was intentional...
-   In _Duckman_, Beatrice becomes one in terms of gender equality, at one point lobbying to change the term mailman<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  to personperson.
    
    -   Duckman also featured occasional appearances from Iggy Catalpa, a wannabe comedian who tries to make his jokes as inclusive and inoffensive as possible. It doesn't work, until King Chicken comes along with an evil plan, and gives him a liquid charisma potion that makes him appear funny to everyone, except for Duckman, who unknowingly ingested a pill that countered the effects of the potion. It got to the point that a law was passed that all jokes told publicly must be as politically correct as Iggy's, all of this in order to make Duckman feel like an outcast.
    
    **Iggy:** So this medical caregiver of indeterminate gender, because nurses can be male or female, says to his or her disabled, or should I say differently-abled patient, "Why do you have a penguin on your head? They're endangered!" Haaa!
    
-   In _Rick and Morty_, when Rick talks about how he discovered that a magic telescope given to him would have made him retarded, Morty tells him that he shouldn't use that word even though he is using the word as the intended definition rather than an insult. Morty tells him that the word has become a symbolic issue for powerful groups who think they're doing the right thing.
    
    **Rick**: Well, that's retarded.
    
-   One scene from the _Sabrina: The Animated Series_ episode "A Witchmas Carol" shows Gem Stone's nanny passing her Christmas Eve watching a TV show titled "The Completely Inoffensive Nondenominational Television Special That Just Happens to Air at the End of December", which features an "Inoffensive Nondenominational chorus" that sings Christmas songs with all references to Christmas removed.
-   The _Sonic Boom_ episode "Role Models" has the protagonists made role models by Mayor Fink, and assigned the coach D.B. Platypus. The parody is that Mr. Platypus continuously interferes with the protagonists to keep them in line with being role models that not only does it get on their nerves, but it impairs their ability to fight Eggman, something even the kids they're _supposed_ to be role models for comment on. Sticks gets so irate with it that she launches Mr. Platypus into a trash can and ferries the kids off for a bite to eat, thus freeing up the rest of the team to send the doctor packing.
-   _Animaniacs_: During Slappy Squirrel's time as a golden age cartoon star, one of her adversaries was Beanie the Brain-Dead Bison. By the time of the show, the public has taken to referring him with the more PC term "the Cerebreally-Challenged Bison". Slappy, being who she is, sticks with "Brain-Dead".
-   The _Captain Sturdy_ pilot _Captain Sturdy: Back in Action_ featured a superhero named Politically Correct Person, who was so obsessed with political correctness that it prevented him from being an effectual crime-fighter. The short begins with him and two other heroes failing to stop some criminals from escaping because he wasted time rambling on how the education system has failed the criminals. He later scolds another superhero during a training exercise for saying "Drop your weapon and put your hands up" without considering that he could be saying that to a bank robber who didn't have arms.
-   _Clone High_: In the beginning of "Snowflake Day", this is one of the first things heard:
    
    **Mr. Scudworth**: I can hardly believe it's only been a year since the United Nations abolished religious holidays in favor of the non-offensive, all-inclusive, Snowflake Day!
