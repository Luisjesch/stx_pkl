**Barbarian:** Conan! What is best in life?  
**Conan:** To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentation of their women.

A specific subtrope of Blood Knight, the Proud Warrior Race Guy seeks battle and bloodshed because his culture teaches that doing so is the greatest source of personal honor and glory. This Proud Warrior Race will often be based on a very glorified view of one of several real world cultures who are perceived to have acted this way, such as the Mongols, Samurai, Spartans, Vikings or American Indians. The Proud Warrior Race Guy is often depicted as either a hero or a protagonist's ally, but only because the protagonists just happen to not be on his rape and pillage lists. For now. If evil, he will probably be the Worthy Opponent.

"Proud" does NOT mean having a sense of chivalry: those too weak to be worthy of the Proud Warrior Guy's interest can be slapped around like a slave. The Proud Warrior Guy's respect and honor polarizes his interactions with people: he bows to worthy fighters whose capacity to do violence equals or exceeds his own (even if they revile his cultural views), and everyone else is treated as pitiful slaves. In many ways, this trope is just a glorified version of a man groveling to his betters and looking down on those who cannot fight, also known as Might Makes Right.

"Proud", in this case, often means "Arrogant and Psychopathically Violent". Critiques of this position will be met with: "You do _not_ understand". May occasionally overlap with the Always Chaotic Evil race, though the two are usually differentiated by the Proud Warrior having a strict Code of Honour (which may include paying debts, loyalty to companions and officers, and fighting with honor), while the Chaotic Evil race has no real rules and does cowardly or underhanded things. If the Proud Warrior guy's Code of Honour is too alien for humans to understand, or too xenophobic to allow cooperation, then the heroes will treat them just like the Chaotic Evil race. The better sort of Code of Honour will enforce Would Not Shoot a Civilian, although often because civilians are dismissed as too weak and cowardly to be good fighters, and so they get passed over in the search for worthy enemies. Since he operates on Might Makes Right, this also means when he does meet a worthy foe and is defeated, he has no qualms about bending to his better's will.

In fantasy and science fiction, this trope is a handy way to add nuance and pathos to a formerly Always Chaotic Evil race, since it lets them keep their basic toughness and explains why they might not always get along with their neighbours. Orcs are a frequent candidate for this, and nearly all sympathetic portrayals of them will lean into this trope to give them a bit of dignity without making them utterly unrecognizable as orcs.

While most commonly seen in science fiction programs in the guise of Rubber-Forehead Aliens<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , the Proud Warrior Race Guy is not limited to that genre. Consider Hawk in _Spenser For Hire_, B.A. in _The A-Team_, and Tonto in _The Lone Ranger_ or Kato in _The Green Hornet_. This trope currently tends to be limited to SF because applying it to human races really skirts the bounds of current racial sensitivities (imagine treating the Klansmen knights as riders of justice). You don't see a lot of the Noble Savage anymore either, except as alien races, for the same reason.

One variant to this might be a Proud Hunter Race, such as the Predator, clad in bones and skulls with a head mounted on a spear. Just replace the aforementioned 'battle and bloodshed' with 'worthy prey and trophies,' and replace the large scale wars and battlefields with extended hunts in the jungle or swamp. These types tend to be The Stoic, since hunting requires one to be quiet when stalking prey. Individuals of this variant might be the Hunter Trapper, Scarily Competent Tracker, The Beastmaster, or Stealth Expert when compared to other versions of this trope, but will generally speak and behave extremely similarly. Species that are essentially aliens/creatures based on predatory animals, such as the Cat Folk or Lizard Folk often found in many Science Fiction and Fantasy works, are apt to be of this type because of the connotation between them and their predatory animal inspiration. This variant is also one of the few ways to play the Egomaniac Hunter trope straight while also allowing it to be a heroic figure.

Another variation on this is the Proud _Soldier_ Race Guy — a more low-key version, more like a military society rather than a warrior culture, with more focus on drilling and discipline than just strength at arms. These guys have a tendency to be more technologically advanced and more focused on expansion than conquest — they do not see the harm in dishonorable tactics, but they are pragmatic, not ruthless. The Proud Soldier Race Guy isn't likely to cause any more harm than absolutely necessary to get what he wants. Often ruled by The Emperor or The Warlord.

There are, in fact, a number of Humans Through Alien Eyes\-type works where humans _are_ the Proud Warrior Race (there is also a significant portion of these works in which the aliens _see_ us that way, regardless of whether or not it's actually _true_).

See also Blood Knight and Barbarian Tribe. See Warrior Poet for what happens when the Proud Warrior Race Guy becomes more developed. Often is fond of being In Harm's Way, and is a Glory Seeker wanting to be Famed In-Story. They often are of the belief that this means they have a Badass Army, but often are proven wrong. May be from a Martyrdom Culture and worship a War God. Frequently crossed with or has strong elements of the Noble Savage. Being a culture singularly focused on the warrior way, anyone performing non-warrior roles frequently suffer from Klingon Scientists Get No Respect. If they manage to conquer another nation, can become members of a Foreign Ruling Class. Often wind up seeking out an Honorable Warrior's Death, especially if they are or have grown old and it hasn't found them without help.

Also compare Proud Hunter Race, Proud Industrious Race, Proud Scholar Race and Proud Merchant Race for different kinds of hats a species can wear.

If humanity is portrayed as the Proud Warrior Race, it's Humans Are Warriors.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Pai Thunder from _Dangaioh_ initially refuses to team with Naïve Everygirl Mia Alice because she is not warrior-like. As it turns out, Pai is genetically predisposed to violence, because she is really Barius, the daughter of pirate warlord The Banker. Once her father tries to force her kill one of her classmates and Mia bails her out, she accepts Mia's leadership.
-   _Daimos_: Richter insists that the Baam-seijin, him included, were also born for combat and holds that trait with pride, alongside other ideals such as "Better die than to be taken prisoner". When his sister is captured by the enemy and doesn't commit Seppuku, he is actually angry at her.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   _Dragon Ball Z_ introduces the Saiyan race from Planet Vegeta (of whom Prince Vegeta, Goku and Broly are the only pure-blooded survivors). They have an unmatched desire and instinct for battle. Whilst Vegeta insists that the Saiyans were a proud species and attaches great importance to honour, by all accounts the Saiyans were more barbaric opportunists, and Vegeta himself engages in a fair deal of Combat Pragmatism in his early appearances. Their true Proud Warrior Race credentials come from their genetics. They are naturally far stronger and more adept at fighting than most other species, have the ability to transform into a giant ape in the full moon, and gain far more from training than others due to their ability to grow significantly stronger after surviving a near-death experience. If that wasn't enough, they have the dormant ability to become a Super Saiyan, multiplying their power even further. They even age more slowly than humans, which is explicitly stated to be a way to maintain their peak fighting condition for longer. Goku and half-Saiyans like Goten and Trunks have less of an idea of honour but retain the Saiyan fighting instinct. Vegeta hints the Saiyan sense of honour is inherent in pure-blooded Saiyans since Goku knows nothing of Saiyan culture, and still would've rather died (or gave up the fight) than achieve victory over an opponent by eating a senzu bean to win.
    -   Averted by Gohan, who is half-Saiyan (and very powerful) but doesn't really enjoy fighting as much as other Saiyans. He doesn't much bother with training unless he anticipates having to fight a villain. Despite being one of the most intelligent characters in the series, he's too Genre Blind to realize there will _always_ be another villain to fight.
    -   Gohan's brother, Goten, as well as his best friend (and son of Vegeta) Trunks, seem to enjoy fighting, but see it more as a fun game than as a manner of honor.
    -   Also averted with Gohan's grandmother, Gine. She was born a pacifistic among the Saiyans.
    -   Averted yet again in _Dragon Ball Super_ by the Saiyans of Universe 6, who share very little of the warrior culture embraced by their Universe 7 counterparts. About the only Universe 6 Saiyan who _does_ share a considerable amount is Caulifla.
-   Nouza of _Gaiking: Legend of Daiku Maryu_ is the strongest Knight in Darius, a fact that he throws around with great abandon. On multiple occasions, he executes his underlings for sullying the name of the Darius Knights.
-   The Yato Clan from _Gintama_ are known everywhere in the universe for being the strongest warrior race. The Shinra and the Dakini come close.
-   Though all of the Nations as People of _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ fit this to some degree (because, as stated earlier, all human cultures do), the one most resembling this trope is Germany's big brother Prussia, who blatantly totes his used-to-be-empire as superior to all others, and is perfectly willing to prove it when given the chance, especially against Austria. As is the standard for this trope, Prussia gets horrifically beaten by Hungary, and later he is dissolved and given to Russia.
-   Technically, the Pillar Men of _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency_ are a proud warrior race of vampires, but in practice only Wamuu counts, being a Noble Demon who shows respect whenever an enemy turns out to be a Worthy Opponent; Santana is mindlessly destructive, Esidisi is a Jerkass showoff, and Kars is power-mad.
-   The Zentraedi race (divided into "Zentran" and "Meltran", or male and female, sides) from _Macross_ are examples of this trope. It also serves as a bit of a deconstruction, as the Zentraedi have no idea how to even repair their own equipment (_everyone_ is a warrior; no scientists and no engineers). This was intentional, to render them ineffective if they ever turned against their masters. Indeed, a major running theme of the series (in particular the original _Super Dimension Fortress Macross_) is the Zentraedi becoming "cultured" by learning how to pursue (or even simply enjoy) more peaceful pastimes.
    -   Klein Klan of _Macross Frontier_ is a Worf of sorts for the Zentraedi; while she isn't a raging berserker most of the time (although after a certain event in the plot she gets rather terrifying), she is _extremely_ proud of her heritage and generally doesn't miss a chance to remind people of Zentraedi superiority in combat and warfare whenever possible, despite being fully "cultured". Hilariously, she also suffers from some of The Worf Effect given how often she gets a hole blown in her power armor, and, to her profound and continued annoyance, she's only about four and a half feet tall whenever she's "micronized" down to human size outside of combat.
-   The Jovians from _Martian Successor Nadesico_ are actually just a bunch of normal humans who became Proud Warrior Colony Guys, basing their society off a martial interpretation of a Super Robot show. Their named mecha pilots particularly exemplify this.
-   The Mykene from _Mazinger Z_ and _Great Mazinger_. Although not all of them were warriors, these that were showed they were proud of their warlike skills and eager for using them. Also, the Warrior Beasts were made by grafting into the mechanical body of a Humongous Mecha the brain of a Mykene soldier indoctrinated to fight and exterminate all non-Mykene civilizations.
-   In _Naruto_, while many civilians do exist, a large amount of youths become ninja. There doesn't seem to be a specific age-limit on being a ninja. Some clans such as the Aburame seem to make it obligatory for their members to become ninja. Most people become ninjas between eleven and thirteen, but Child Prodigys like Kakashi can become genin at as young as five. During the Warring Clans era, the average life expectancy of ninjas was 30, due to the large amount of Child Soldier ninjas getting killed.
-   _The Seven Deadly Sins_ has Liones, a country in which vigilantes might burn down the house of a "traitor"'s family and The Good King was overthrown just because he ordered its people to demilitarize. Every native of Liones shown is either a Holy Knight or closely related to one.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   The giants that come from the island of Elbaf are proud warriors in the tradition of the Vikings. The first two giants the crew meet, in fact, take this to the extreme by fighting for a century (a third of their average lifespan) over a quarrel they've both long forgotten purely because their honor is at stake. The reason? _Whose catch was bigger._
    -   Wiper and his fellow Shandian warriors. Their ancestors lost their homeland to the Skypieans 400 years ago, and they've spent every year since fighting to reclaim it, rejecting Gan Fall's attemps at resolving the conflict through peaceful diplomacy. Enel usurping rulership of Skypiea did very little to change things. When word reaches them that one of Enel's four priests has been defeated, Wiper gathers every able-bodied warrior and leads the Shandians to invade Upper Yard in order to depose Enel and finally reclaim their home in order to fulfill Calgara's promise to Montblanc Noland.
    -   The Mink Tribe is this in its entirety. Yes, even the children. According to a Mink elder, every Mink is a natural-born warrior, and it shows: when the Beast Pirates invade Zou, the civilians are quick to show their combat prowess by repelling the invaders via a mixture of martial arts and Electro, which every Mink is able to use. And the conflict escalates when the _actual_ armed forces show up.
-   The Ctarl-Ctarl, the race of cat-people from _Outlaw Star_, seem to qualify, but really only Aisha Clan-clan seems to care about conquest and honor, many other members of her race are just normal workin' folks.
-   The werewolves in _Princess Resurrection_ are this. To the point where they properly introduce themselves before a fight and identify their parents! "I am Riza Wildman! Daughter of the warrior Volg Wildman!" They take great offense to ANY challenge to their or their family's honor or strength. Hime even made a point of killing Risa's brother Lobo from the front because she knew a werewolf warrior getting killed from behind is considered an unbearable stain on his/her honor.
-   The vampires from _Rosario + Vampire_ are very much a proud warrior race, to the point that Moka's father once ordered her two older sisters to fight to the death simply to measure Akuha's strength.
-   Shishio Makoto of _Rurouni Kenshin_ is this trope taken to its darkest logical conclusion; a warrior whose respect for strength is so _absolute_ that he wishes to create a Japan where _everyone_ has to be a warrior just to _survive._
-   _Transformers Unicron Trilogy_:
    -   Starscream is this in spades for _Transformers: Armada_ as well as in _Energon_ and _Cybertron_.
    -   In _Transformers: Cybertron_, the denizens of Jungle Planet are like this. Their leader, Scourge, even owes a little of his design to Dinobot.
-   The Vegans from _UFO Robo Grendizer_ were also one race whose society revolved around fighting and war. Many commanders of the army belonged to the Honor Before Reason school of thought and would rather dying taking their enemy with them before admitting defeat.
-   Done very well on the anime _Wolf's Rain_, where the four main characters were all Proud Warrior Race Guys, but some of them had huge doubts about the whole thing — and while some of them become Warrior Poets, they were very unusual ones.
-   _Voltes V_: The Boazanians believe this, hence their Fantastic Racism towards the humans. Heinel also internalizes this belief deeply.
    
    **Kenichi:** _"Heinel! This battle is over!"_
    
    **Heinel:** _"It's not over! The battle of the most superior race in the universe, the Boazan nobles who have horns on their heads, will continue until the last man, human or Boazanian is standing!"_
    

    Comic Books 

-   The Phaedons in _Bad Planet_ are another desconstructed example: large, grey humanoid aliens with no individual names that don't need to eat or breath bred only for fighting and killing. Their constant wars among themselves left their world severely weakened and impoverished, just before an plague of death-spiders that eat resources finished them off because they were.
-   The Khunds are functionally The DCU's Klingons though they debuted three years before _Star Trek_ began.
-   Nolan and the other Viltrumites from _Invincible_ are this. The whole Viltrumite race is basically what would happen if Spartans had Superman-like superpowers.
-   Marvel's Kree, Skrull, and Shi'ar empires are all like this to a greater or lesser extent. Though as shapeshifters, the Skrulls certainly see no dishonor in using deception as a tactic. The offshoot of the Skrull race known as the Dire Wraiths are an aversion. They are so self-consciously evil that they would probably take any suggestion that they had honor as an _insult._ Understandably, the Skrulls hate them.
    -   The Kree mixes this trope with modern militarism and the Shi'ar are pretty much Space Romans.
-   Shadow Lass's home planet of Talok VIII.
-   Marvel's Skrulls are military and expansionist, but are too sneaky and underhanded to really be this trope. Their hereditary enemies the Kree, on the other hand, actively revere war as a _concept._
-   The Castaka clan in _The Metabarons_ are dedicated to a bushido-like code and will kill or be killed for honor. They also favor primitive weapons like swords and double-barreled pistols, especially for ritual combat.
-   Prince Acroyear of the Acroyears, from Marvel's toy-licensed comic, _Micronauts_. Worth noting because he is one of the earliest mass-market appearances of the Proud Warrior Race Guy as a stock crew member on a Space Opera Cool Ship. It is also worth noting that he is portrayed as dark-skinned, despite otherwise-alien features — i.e., "played by an African-American". That is not just incidental, either: a major plot point has his albino brother Shaitan driven to madness,evil, and betrayal by his perceived inferiority.
-   The Mighty Thor and the rest of the Asgardians. Loki and Amora the Enchantress are considered cowards and deviants for using magic, dirty tricks, and deception, as they dislike fighting and only fight as a last resort.
-   The Horde from _Strikeforce: Morituri_ play this straight with each other, but subvert it in their treatment of humans, where they act as savage bullies from a position of strength. They have no qualms about slaughtering human slaves and children for petty reasons, and resort to terror tactics to intimidate humanity when the Morituri begin to become more dangerous.
-   The concept of a proud warrior race was deconstructed with the Wolrog Empire, who appeared in a long _Strontium Dog_ story when _Starlord_ merged with _2000 AD_. The Wolrogs are psychotic, vicious, cruel, sadistic, genocidal maniacs who live only for battle and death, and are feared and hated by the other races in the galaxy. They tend to kidnap innocent people to serve as captive soldiers or slaves to fuel the war effort. In the same comic, Wulf may be an example of the more noble variety.
-   The J'ai in Superman and Supergirl storyline _Krypton No More_ are a alien race of savage, multi-armed warriors. They have no alternative to war because they don't know anything else.
-   In Superman/Supergirl story _War World_, the Warzoons are an alien race to who fight and conquest is "as important as breathing". They build Warworld, a _huge_ weapon satellite.
-   Starfire from _Teen Titans_ is a Proud Warrior Race Girl, in the original comic version anyway. She was sweet to most people, but could easily become violent. In her "first meeting" with the Titans recalled in a later episode of the TV series, she was this way too, making her "later" Genki Girl personality seem rather puzzling. Her Blood Knight behavior does appear sometimes. Word of God is that Starfire in the cartoon was designed like a Foreign Exchange Student.
-   Deconstructed with the portrayal of one of the original real-world Proud Warrior Races in _Three_, which concentrates on the Spartans' grotesque abuse of their serf class and on how the impracticality of their ideals over time led to their decline.
-   _The Transformers (Marvel)_: Megatron considered himself to be one of these, as seen by his distaste for killing an easy foe like Ratchet. In a later issue, he demonstrates joy at getting to kill Ratchet after the latter had learned some of the way of the warrior. Much later, in the UK story "The Fall and Rise of the Decepticon Empire", he actually refers to the Decepticons as a 'proud warrior race'.
-   _The Transformers (IDW)_ has turned Thundercracker into a Proud Warrior Race Guy, one who is not very satisfied with the current state of Decepticon affairs and ends up joining the Autobots.
-   Maxima enjoys battle so much that she considers her fight against Doomsday to be a fun time.
-   _Wild CATS Wild Storm_: Zealot is a pretty standard (female) example of this trope. Her entire race, the Kherubim, is equal parts Proud Warrior Race and '90s Anti-Hero.
-   Orube from _W.I.T.C.H._ is this, albeit being female; yet where she comes from, the planet Basiliade, males and females are trained alike in the martial arts from an early age. Orube is one of the best warriors, having been trained both in Basiliade and Kandrakar; unfortunately, her mental training hasn't been quite as effective, and she still sometimes has problems controlling her temper.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   The titular heroine is a Themysciran warrior. Amazons can vary from any level of pacifist to fighting at any provocation, but all of them (Queen Hippolyta, Wonder Girls Donna and Cassandra, Lyta Trevor...) love and excel at fighting, they're just usually opposed to _killing_ humans.
    -   Diana gets confronted by the alien Khunds in one comic, and promptly defeats them. This part tends to vary Depending on the Writer. The khund reaction to her under Gail Simone's pen is qute respectful;
        
        **Kharhi**: I ask, why do you imagine we would attack you, you in particular, with such a large and mighty force?  
        **Wonder Woman**: A test?  
        **Kharhi**: No. Try to think like a Khund, Destroyer.  
        **Wonder Woman**: As _tribute_. To _honor_ me.  
        **Kharhi**: Yes. You comprehend. Perhaps the legends are true.
        
    -   In _Supergirl_ story _The Supergirl from Krypton (2004)_, when the troops of Darkseid raid Themyscira, the Amazons are eager to engage them.
-   X-Factor's/X-Force's Shatterstar is another Marvel example. By design.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Flash Gordon_: Pretty nearly every race on Mongo would qualify. Lion Men, Hawkmen, Arborians, etc. In the Filmation TV series, Flash is quick to point out that the only reason Ming can get away with tyrannizing the planet is that all the races are at each others' throats instead of uniting against him. Flash works very hard to help fix that.

    Fan Works 

-   Deconstructed in the _MLP:FIM_ fanfic _Heart of Gold, Feathers of Steel_. Gilda has plenty of warrior instincts. However, they do her more harm than good — which she herself acknowledges. Similarly, her father's and other griffins' insistence on following the old war-like ways is what's slowly driving the griffin tribes to extinction.
-   _Intelligence Factor_: Urshifu society revolves around training themselves until they're strong enough to fight in wars.
-   The Unicornicopians of _My Brave Pony: Starfleet Magic_ and its various Fix Fics. They are happy to go to battle and love to lord their superiority over other races. Of course, their skill tends to vary depending on what's needed for the plot.
-   The all-male Hell Knights, also called the Nephilim, from _Sonic X: Dark Chaos_ are an entire race of these who have dedicated themselves to Maledict as an eternal warrior class. In a similar vein to Vikings, they are utterly relentless in battle, but have extremely strong — and unusual — honor codes.
-   The _RWBY_ fic _So We're A Couple_ gives an interesting case with the Boreale Knights that reads like equal parts analysis and justification of the Soldier type. The land of Boreale was trapped in a glacial bowl during Remnant's most recent Ice Age, isolating the region from "the Advent of Dust" to combat the Grimm. While the other Kingdom's flourished with technology derived from using Dust to build and reclaim the world, the Boreale were left to their own devices. While the extreme terrain of Boreale—and more than a few of the region's fauna—shielded the primeval tribes from the brunt of Grimm invasions, the Boreal Knights were founded to combat the handfuls that managed to worm their way into the populated regions. Because of this, the Knights became very, very good fighters. So much so, that when the neighboring Kingdom of Mistral tried to invade, the Knights were able to fend off the greater Mistralian army while remarkably outnumbered. And then, there are the Huntsmen...
-   The soldier race variant is discussed in _Strange Times Are Upon Us_ in reference to the Breen, comparing it favorably to the Klingon approach which the Lethean gun-for-hire protagonist Brokosh has a very dim view of.
    
    He'd always admired the ethos of Breen soldiers, their willingness to sacrifice for the mission, not glory. Not unlike Starfleet, come to think of it. But Starfleet didn't share the Breens' sheer bloody-minded military pragmatism and cold calculation.
    
-   Ferris of _Life Ore Death_ subverts this. Her native culture valued education, philosophy, and manners over violence, but she grew into something of The Brute compared to most of her fellows, which she is semi-embarassedly self-aware about on occasion.
-   In _Warriors Redux_, ThunderClan is known as the most fight-happy Clan. They also consist of the largest, most muscular cats:
    
    _ThunderClan is quite militaristic compared to their neighbors. Apprentices are trained as much, if not more, in fighting as they are in hunting, and the sheer enthusiasm for battle means that challenging them is a very, very bad idea. The other Clans are understandably reluctant to engage them in a fight, but they will grudgingly admit that ThunderClan’s reputation as a gang that eats the bones of loners and kittypets has prevented a significant amount of trouble for everyone else._
    

    Films — Animation 

-   Interestingly inverted in _Princess Mononoke_; although Ashitaka does come from a tribe of historical proud warrior race guys, by now they just want to be left alone, and he only fights when he has to, or when his curse makes him. It's actually San, who was Raised by Wolves, who's the berserker type.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The Spartans from the movie _300_. As in Real Life, the Spartans live for battle and dying honorably.
-   _The Chronicles of Riddick_:
    -   The Furyan race are heavily implied to have been this.
    -   The Necromongers.
-   In _The Cossacks_, the titular Cossacks are horrified when a man from Moscow tells them that the Tsar has made peace with the Turks, their hated enemies. Without fighting, they have nothing else to do. The Cossacks then write a deliberately insulting letter to the Turks in hopes that the Turks will attack them again.
-   The Mangalores from _The Fifth Element_ are this, but also tend to be incredibly stupid. Zorg considers their idea of dying for "honor" to be ridiculous. Ends up being what kills him, as they brought a bomb that blows up the space station they were killed in, just after Zorg deactivates the one he installed first.
    
    _For the honor..._
    
-   The Warboys from _Mad Max: Fury Road_. As if the name wasn't enough of a clue, they hold a sort of perverse Viking-esque code, worshipping Immortan Joe as a living god, believing in Valhalla, and a penchant for combat drugs and psychotic berserker attacks. Deconstructed in that the whole point of them is to show audiences just how unhealthy and restrictive such a culture, with it's insane veneration of death and masculinity, really is, most noticeably to its women, but also to anyone who isn't squarely top of the heap.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   Thor is a Deconstruction: if all you're raised to believe is that honoring your country and fellow man comes by smashing fools in the head with a mystical hammer, then you'll be looking for reasons to pick fights, even if there are good reasons why no one is. Thor gathers his friends and marches onto Jötunheim to demand satisfaction after some Jötuns illegally trespassed into a secure area of Odin's castle. While he may have been right to seek an explanation from their sworn enemy, doing so by threatening to beat up everyone in the kingdom is _not_ wise, as he finds out when his father has to bail him out and assure Laufey that Asgard doesn't want a war at the moment any more than Laufey does.
    -   In _Captain Marvel_, the Kree are a militarized species and proud of it, and Carol starts with this mindset, too, confidently describing the Kree as "noble warrior heroes" to Fury. Once she learns about her past and the nature of the Kree and Skrull conflict, she changes her mind, vowing to destroy the Supreme Intelligence and defend Earth and the Skrulls from the Kree.
-   One of the recurring themes of the New Zealand film (and book) _Once Were Warriors_, about a family of modern-day Maori.
-   The title creatures in the _Predator_ movies. Well, they're more like Proud _Hunter_ Race Guys. But so damn proud of hunting that they even stalk _Aliens_ as big game. As they become more skilled, they hunt more dangerous game. They view the Aliens as little more than deer, and use them as a Rite of Passage, to see what young Predators are strong enough to survive. In the expanded universe of the books and comics, older Predators may attain enough honor to essentially retire from hunting. A clan leader would be exceptionally stronger and a much better fighter than any of the Predators commonly encountered in either the movies or comics. The females typically don't hunt, because they're massive — on a similar scale to the Queen Aliens vs the warrior/drone Aliens — and would be unlikely to encounter a species worthy of an honorable hunt.
-   The Afghan Mujahideen, and Afghans generally, from _Rambo III_. They are perfectly willing to die in battle against the Soviets, even fighting Soviet tanks and helicopters on horseback.
-   Knuckles and the other Echidnas in _Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022)_ are portrayed as this. They were a tribe of warriors who created the Master Emerald to use as a weapon while preventing the Chaos Emeralds from falling into the wrong hands, leading to the conflict with the Owls. Knuckles himself brags about being "trained in all forms of combat" and mocks Sonic for being Unskilled, but Strong.
-   _Conan the Destroyer_: Zula is a fierce fighter who obviously loves battle and says her entire tribe are warriors after Girly Girl princess Jehnna comments on her being the first warrior woman she's ever met.

    Manhua 

-   _Retired Heroes_: It's mentioned that the demons hold a massive fighting contest to determine who their leaders are. And the contest used to be lethal. Other than that, demons seem mostly the same as humans... but they're still treated as Always Chaotic Evil monsters.

    Music 

-   The Barbarian in Ayreon's "Into the Electric Castle" fits this trope perfectly. He constantly brags about the battles he's fought and dies when his pride drives him to go through the Sparkly Door of Death.
-   "Immigrant Song" by Led Zeppelin is about Horny Vikings, so this trope is to be expected.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Classical Mythology
    -   The Amazons are among the most famous examples, with some sources claiming that each warrior voluntarily removed one breast to make wielding weapons easier.
    -   Centaurs were a combination of this and Mr. Vice Guy.
-   Norse Mythology: The hero Starkad takes the martial code of honor more serious than others. In Book 6 of _Gesta Danorum_, Starkad agrees to help Helge in a single combat against nine brothers. On the appointed day, Helge oversleeps and Starkad is too proud to wake him, so he goes to the combat alone. His nine opponents offer Starkad to attack him one by one, but he rudely tells them to come at him all at once. Starkad kills all nine, but is severely wounded so he is forced to wait for random passersby to help him. One by one, a sheriff, a free man married to another man's slave, and a slave woman with a baby to feed offer to bandage his wounds, but are refused because Starkad considers it beneath him to get his life saved by them. Finally there comes a peasant laborer, son of a laborer, whom Starkad considers worthy to be his rescuer.
-   Onomastics: Often invoked in this form of of micro-folklore. The Royal Navy once commissioned the Tribal class destroyers named after various tribes which had a reputation for this. Several athletic teams also.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _BattleTech_
    -   The Clans are extremely warlike Social Darwinists obsessed with ritual combat, they settle practically every dispute with fights, even to decide who gets to fight in the larger battles. In fact, while the Clans have no problem with casual sex and reproduction, the warrior caste has a prejudice against so-called "freebirths", disadvantaging them in the Clan armies in favor of "Trueborn" genetically-engineered warriors that are drawn from the genetic legacies of warriors who have proved themselves in combat. Unfortunately this culture did not help them when they invaded the Inner Sphere, as they had a much less Obstructive Code of Conduct and had been fighting one another continuously for longer than the Clans have existed.
        -   The Clans arguably Deconstructed this trope, because once the Inner Sphere had managed to account for the Clan's significant tech advantage, the Clans proved to be hopelessly ineffective at actually conquering the Inner Sphere. They'd ritualised war almost to the point of a game, something they'd been forced to do in order to minimise the waste of their minimal material assets out beyond the boundaries of old Star League space, so when they waged war, it was to determine who was right. In the Inner Sphere, on the other hand, where resources were much more expendable, they fought to determine who was _left._ The Clans had completely lost any understanding of total warfare, so when the Inner Sphere struck back, they rapidly taught the Clans the _hard_ way that War Is Hell, not glorious. And with their much-vaunted "trueborn" warriors not proving to be all that superior to hardened veterans of the Succession Wars after all, the only way the Clans could keep up with their opponents was to abandon much of their proud warrior traditions, which led to cultural schisms that eventually tore their already shaky unity apart, until the Clans eventually ended up doing more damage to themselves than even the Inner Sphere did.
    -   A few Inner Sphere nations have martial cultures, though not to the same extreme as the Clans. The Draconis Combine, which bases its government on feudal Japan, has a distinct warrior tradition, based on a distorted view of the classical Japanese Samurai creed of _bushido_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
    -   Although not a warrior culture per se, the Capellan Confederation does have Warrior Houses that follow the so-called "Lorix Order", a mishmash of pseudo-philosophy written by a MechWarrior that tried to make all MechWarriors into this by default.
-   _Bleak World_ has many; Vigilante Humans, Primal Vampires, every werebeast that isn't in the Techno Wolves, Aztec, Norse, and Natural mummies, many princesses, and the Jotun. They all vary wildly on the spectrum however, with Primal Vampires being an all consuming horde, while the Jotun are just trying to get back home, where they can't be harmed permanently in their fights.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Most dwarven cultures are portrayed as strongly militaristic and belligerent, but still honorable and friendly to their allies.
    -   Hobgoblins, on the other hand, are closer to Proud Soldier Race with a mix of Sociopathic Soldier. Other "savage humanoids" like orcs, gnolls, and bugbears also have cultures based around violence (they _are_ there for players to slaughter en masse, after all), but lack the hobgoblins' formal militarism.
        -   More nuanced depictions of gnolls (such as found in _Pathfinder_) will usually cut the "proud" part as well. A race of Combat Pragmatists who are loyal to their clan above all else, these gnolls take a "don't be a hero" attitude, seeing concepts like personal honour as inherently selfish, since the loss of a single gnoll - even via a Heroic Sacrifice - is a loss for the entire clan. This usually causes their neighbours to see them as a bunch of Dirty Coward Heinous Hyena people, but those who take time to understand gnoll culture usually find something to respect, if not necessarily admire.
    -   Revised 3rd Edition introduced the dragonborn, a new race who gradually found their hat as mercenaries and warriors who value honor and loyalty.
    -   The Tuigan tribal nation in _D&D_'s _Forgotten Realms_ setting were a Fantasy Counterpart Culture to the real-world medieval Mongols, and as such had a militant society revolving around mounted combat. This changed when their emperor, Yamun Khahan, died; the survivors of the horde either integrated into the local agrarian populace or went back to the steppes, where Yamun's son started encouraging them to settle down in towns and sponsored peaceful contact with their neighbors.
    -   The elves of the Valaes Tairn in Eberron are essentially what happens when Klingons, Mongols, and the Vietcong are given a scimitar and let rip. The literal worst insult in their culture is accusing someone of disgracing the blood of his ancestors — and if you say this to one, _he will gleefully cut you in half_.
    -   Interestingly despite being the usual candidates, the Orcs of _Eberron_ are actually an Aversion, being peaceful and reclusive humanoids with a druidic religion.
    -   Karrnath, one of _Eberron_'s Five Nations, is a Proud Soldier Race (well, nation) version. Each of the Five Nations was lined up with a character class in the stereotypical adventuring party, with Karrnath being the fighter. Both Karrn the Conqueror, who led to the formation of the Five Nations in his bid to conquer all of Khorvaire, and Galifar the Uniter, who actually did conquer all of Khorvaire, were Karrns, and in the wake of Galifar's victory, he established the unified kingdom's premier officer training school in the Karrnathi city of Rekkenmark. Even Kaius I's role in the Succession Crisis that precipitated the Last War was based on the idea that a big war was coming, so it only made sense to put a Karrn leader on the throne instead of the typical Cyran...which then kicked off a much bigger war than he could have expected. Unfortunately, due to some early famines that sapped its ability to fight and Kaius making a devil's bargain with Lady Illmarrow, Karrn military honour played only a minor role in the Last War, with the country becoming more associated with the use of undead shock troops and cruel, underhanded strategems, with restoring its honour as a major post-war challenge.
    -   There are also the Ysgardian natives, who love fighting and tend to challenge everyone to a duel to the death... forgetting that non-natives don't get back up at the end of the day. Oops.
    -   Githyanki are Scary Dogmatic Aliens from the Astral Plane who are fighting a Forever War against the Illithids (Mind Flayers) as revenge for their past enslavement, and see the other races as beneath them. They're ruthless pillagers and raiders of many worlds and live in a rigid, militaristic society.
    -   The scro in _Spelljammer_ are advanced orcs who have developed a regimented military culture. The giff have a fondness for military pomp and powerful explosives that dramatically increases both the absurdity and the danger of a seven-foot humanoid hippo.
-   _Exalted_:
    -   We have the Dragon Kings, humanoid dinosaur-men with Elemental Powers who believe that the best way to venerate the gods is through combat to the death.
    -   A lot of other cultures, including many icewalkers and the entire population of Harborhead, would also qualify.
    -   _Exalted_ also has the Dragon-Blooded, or Terrestrial Exalted (no connection to the aforementioned Dragon Kings). The two prominent Dragon-Blooded cultures are the Realm and Lookshy, and both are of the Proud Soldier Race varient. Lookshy is strongly militaristic and requires all of its Dragon-Blooded to receive extensive military training, including charms (magical abilities) useful on the battlefield. The Realm skews more heavily toward a Decadent Court, but standard dynastic education for both mortals and Exalts includes basic training in archery, melee, martial arts, and war, and those unskilled in these abilities are considered poorly prepared for dynastic life, and are often considered embarrassments to their families.
-   The Vorox, a race of large, primitive, aggressive, six-limbed furry aliens from the _Fading Suns_ roleplaying game. To make them appear extra-special cool with cream on top, the authors even gave them their own special alien martial arts style.
    -   Among humans, the Hazat (_not_ House Hazat) are the most openly aggressive and military of the Great Houses. In a setting where duelling owes a lot to _Dune_, the Hazat don't fight with Deflector Shields and daggers; they view the shields as cowardly, and prefer to use somewhat beefier weapons than duelling knives.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
    -   Minotaurs, especially the character Tahngarth.
    -   While everyone in the Tarkir setting is warlike the Mardu and their successors, the Kolaghan, are both examples — and a Fantasy Counterpart Culture to Genghis Khan's forces, just to make it nice and clear. The Mardu, at least, had an admittedly brutal code of honour, represented by the inclusion of white mana in their identity; the Kolaghan have lost that in the new timeline, thanks mostly to Kolaghan herself, and are more along the lines of Ax-Crazy Blood Knights who suffer from "the Crave" — an uncontrollable lust for blood and war.
    -   The people of Keld were once all this. The Keldons throughout the storyline of _Magic_ highlight the issues that come with a culture revolving entirely around fighting. Their present day leader Radha has made progress in moving Keld away from this and to find meaning in pursuits other than war. However, there is a movement in Keld opposing her who wants to bring Keld _back_ to being a Proud Warrior Race Guy culture.
-   Another _Old World of Darkness_ example: the trolls of _Changeling: The Dreaming_. One book says that the various kiths of changelings are born from dreams of mankind; trolls are born from dreams of honor. They're some of the greatest warriors in changeling society, and their very nature holds oaths as vitally important.
-   Most _Pathfinder_ orcs are just brutal, but the fierce but not sadistic Bloodied Gauntlet tribe fit this trope. They cherish their Worthy Opponent relationship with their human neighbors so fiercely that they've attacked other orc tribes who dared to mess with them.
-   In _Rocket Age_ the Erisians, their Venusian descendants, the Metisians and the Martian Maduri caste all qualify.
-   The Falar and the Tulgar from the _Spacemaster Privateers_ universe. Both races are anthropomorphic animals: The Falar are large Cat Folk (with subraces looking like tigers, lions and other large cats); they are aggressive, competitive, psychotically arrogant "proud warriors" who look down on anyone they consider weak (or pacifist). The Tulgar are humanoid lupines that look like upright walking wolves, somewhat taller than humans; their culture revolves around the concept of honor and loyalty to the family; their knights fear dishonor above all and follow a chivalric code. And yes, they dress vaguely Asian. Can you say "samurai"?
-   The Needlekin in _The Splinter_. They see The Realm as a massive proving ground and can shape shift into humanoids made of metal spikes.
-   _Talislanta_ has quite a few. Thralls and Ahazu come to mind. (The former are basically magically-created clone troopers covered with symbolic tattoos. The latter are a race of four-armed barbarian Blood Knights with a habit of going "shan-ya" in battle.)
-   _Traveller_:
    -   The Aslan and the Sword Worlders are this. The Aslan are creatures that look like lions to humans, and have a stern code of honor. All male Aslan are theoretically warriors and most useful occupations are done by women. If someone does a designated female occupation they are considered female in Aslan language. More easily understood by the fact that only 1/3 of Aslan are male. Sword Worlders are humans that admire Germanic warriors of yore and think in a manner remarkably similar to Aslan, though men are allowed to actually work. This could cause embarrassment if an Aslan is surprised that the engineer of a passing Sworld Worlder ship is male. And among both of them embarrassments can have awkward results.
    -   There are a number of other Proud Warrior Races in _Traveller_. A number are human sub-cultures, which figures, of course. Notable are the Azhanti whose religion demands that they seek glory.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Given the nature of the setting, the description sort of applies to most races that are still around to be described, but it applies best to the Orks, whose entire culture, biology, nature and philosophy is built for "Waaaagh!-fare".
    -   There's also the Space Marines and the Sisters of Battle, who are both raised-from-childhood fanatical warriors, as well as many Imperial Guard regiments. The Cadian Shock Troops begin live fire exercises before being taught to read and write.
    -   Cadian Shock Troops are noted to be among the greatest soldiers mankind has ever produced; they are among the only human troops universally respected by even the Space Marines. Over 70% of the planet's population is under arms, there are billions of soldiers and population is maintained through special breeding programs. They're also given a lot of live training, given their planet's close proximity to the Eye of Terror, a Negative Space Wedgie that continually chucks hordes of demons and insane super-soldiers at them. Every Cadian is either badass or dead. Their society is so martial even their civilian clothing is camouflage patterns.
    -   Catachan Jungle Fighters _look_ like this, but they're not really. Yes, they're tough bastards (one popular nickname in-universeis "Baby Ogryns" due to their muscles), essentially being Rambo and Dutch by way of The Deer Hunter, but have little in the way of a "culture" due to the fact that they spend literally every waking moment fighting against their own planet, which is trying to kill them. They do, however, very much resent outside authority, and had the "Oops, sorry sir!" rule by which any Kommissar attached to them had a chance of suffering an "unfortunate accident" before the battle even started.
    -   The Eldar of Saim-hann and Biel-tan. The Eldar of Saim-Hann are proud, boisterous barbarians who live in tribal clans, ride jetbikes and settle their differences with duels. The Eldar of Biel-tan are mostly disciplined and merciless Aspect Warriors, and their craftworld is run not by seers but autarchs and exarchs. The two Craftworlds seek to reassert the Eldar as the masters of the galaxy and travel around attacking the upstarts squatting on their planets. Even Eldar in civilian occupations often take to battle as Guardians, and unlike most citizen militia who are fielded out of desperation, the vast majority of Guardians have experience from a warrior path and can hold their own against the trained armies of other races. Anyone who believes that Eldar are all clairvoyant pussies who manipulate other races into doing all the hard work for them should tell that to the Swordwind.
    -   While they may lack in honor, the Eldar's Evil Counterpart the Dark Eldar are certainly extremely proud and definitely a warrior species. Every single one of them is a fighter — they have slave labor to take care of all non-combat activities; except torture, which they do personally. The vast majority of Dark Eldar, male and female, serve as grunts in kabals, but there are also several warrior sects within Dark Eldar society, including Wyches, Incubi, Reavers, and Scourges.
    -   The Tau Fire Caste might qualify, being an entire group raised from birth for combat and having strong martial discipline, but in contrast to the other races they are somewhat of a subversion of the archetype. For example, they attribute no dishonor to a sensible strategic retreat, and consider a "glorious last stand" to be the last resort of an inept commander. They do have pride and honor, just of a form unusual in the setting. Put into perspective: Imperial Guardsmen usually get their training around their teens. Tau Fire Warriors train constantly to become warriors, starting from childhood, and are expressibly forbidden from entering any other vocation. Fire Warriors never retire and fight until they die, although Shas'O generals are eventually presented with retirement, but are still expected to serve as military advisers.
    -   This trope also fits Chaos to a degree. Just about every cultist, daemon, traitor guardsman or marine see going to war in the name of Chaos as one of the highest forms of worship. Although it's arguable to what extent exactly each Chaos warband fits this trope, such as there only being shades of it with the servants of scheming Tzeentch, hedonistic Slaanesh, and pestulant Nurgle. Chaos Undivided seems to fit the trope more than those three, but the followers of Khorne are the kings of this trope as far as Chaos goes. And are also the kings of this trope for the whole setting, really. Their God, whom they strive to emulate, has the title of the _Brass Lord of Battle_ for God's sake. BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!
    -   The Necrons are interpreted as this in modern codexes. They have a strict and complex code of martial honour, and some of the Necron overlords are Noble Demons and Worthy Opponents. It's just this code of honour rarely applies to their opponents...
    -   The Viskeons, a race mentioned in the background for an _Inquisitor_ special character, believed in honorable conflict and so completely disdained ranged weaponry. Eldrad Ulthran subtly steered a splinter of Hive Fleet Kraken away from an Eldar Maiden World toward the Viskeon homeworld. They didn't last a single night.
    -   The Slann — a faction from very early material, and no longer present in the setting — are a highly martial race, and place a great deal of value on military service in their warbands. They fight for love of fighting, and value gallant defeats as much as victories, and most see a death in pitched battle as a perfectly honorable and desirable way to die.
-   _Warhammer_:
    -   Darn near everything, from the fairly standard-issue Dwarves (except with GUNS), Brettonian Knights, hilariously feral Orcs, the men of the Hordes of Chaos, the single-minded Saurus warriors of the Lizardmen...
    -   And let's not forget the various types of elves, from the High Elves and their single-minded Swordmasters, White Lions and Pheonix Guard (not to mention the fact ALL elves forms part of a really quite deadly citizen levy) to the Wood Elves and their bloodthirsty wild hunt. Of course those are the two _nice_ elven factions. Dark Elves happily mix this with Axe-Crazy and a single-minded worship of their god of war.
    -   There's also the Blood Dragons, who fill in this for the Vampire Counts. Basically, they're a vampire bloodline who were formed by a mighty and noble warrior called Abhorash. Abhorash preached that vampires should avoid preying on the weak and defenceless, targeting only worthy challenges and those who deserved it. So he takes a group of loyal followers and forms a splinter faction to practice this. One day, they come across the lair of a huge ancient dragon. Abhorash goes inside, kills the dragon in a 1-on-1 duel, and drinks it's blood; to his surprise, his bloodthirst never came back, but he retained his vampire powers. And so, he commanded his followers to go out and find worthy opponents to slay in the hopes of curing their bloodthirst, and when they were all done, that they then return to him, so the real war could begin.
-   Werewolves in _The World of Darkness_. Both _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_ and _Werewolf: The Forsaken_ present Glory and Honor as forms of renown and rank in werewolf society, and the Garou of _Werewolf: the Apocalypse_ are explicitly defined as "the warriors of Gaia." The Get of Fenris (from _Apocalypse_) and the Blood Talons (from _Forsaken_) are probably the purest embodiment of this trope, though.
-   _World Tree (RPG)_:
    -   The Gormoror are in many ways a parodic exaggeration of this. They mostly live in small tribes on the edges of civilization, and they're obsessed with a Bronze Age sense of honor focused mostly on fighting grand battles and performing mighty deeds. They occupy most of their time with living out their personal heroic legends, generally by challenging one another to dramatic duels, fighting monsters or rival tribes, swearing and keeping honor-oaths, or raiding and sacking other species' settlements for treasure and the glory of killing a few farmers, stealing their stuff and hightailing it before the army arrives.
    -   The Cyarr are highly militaristic, expansionistic and devoted to their personal ideals of honor. They're in a state of constant war, either hot or cold, with the primes, for the sake of honor, revenge for past slights, and territory, and are ruled by warrior-nobilities who hold themselves to incredibly strict moral standards. This lifestyle presents something of an issue for them, however, as they have no access to healing or metal-shaping magic, which gives them serious disadvantages in protracted battles and campaigns — the associated gods plain don't like them and deny these gifts to the Cyarr.

    Theatre 

-   _Cyrano de Bergerac_ presents Truth in Television: for centuries, the Gascons have had this reputation among the French, and at The Cavalier Years they were Impoverished Patricians that sought battle and bloodshed because his culture teaches that dying in battle is the greatest source of personal honor and glory. In the play, all the cadets are Gascons, all of them are poor (except De Guiche) because they don't plan for the future (they are going to die young), and very "proud" in the usual sense ("psychotically violent"). This trope is _deconstructed_ because the very traits that make the Gascons _great warriors_ make them _poor soldiers_: they don't approve of the use of spies or subterfuges in war, and they don't want to learn such things like how to use a cannon because they prefer the sword. In literature, authors like Alexandre Dumas (_The Three Musketeers_) and Cervantes (_Don Quixote_) have recognized Gascuña as home of great warriors… or if you wish, Heroic Sociopaths. This article in English (A cadet of Gascony). and this other in Spanish (Los mosqueteros como herederos de Esparta) Cyrano himself, however, is a literal Warrior Poet.

    Toys 

-   _Beast Wars: Uprising_: Preditron, the first Predacon, who even wrote up a manifesto for how Predacons were supposed to behave. It follows a lot of the behaviour established by Dinobot of _Beast Wars_ fame. Most modern-day Predacons don't follow it, for a variety of reasons.
-   _BIONICLE_:
    -   The Vorox were this (the term was used almost word-for-word in the story) before their regression into savage, bestial creatures. The Bota Magna Vorox are still this trope.
    -   While members of the Brotherhood of Makuta were usually scientists before anything else, Makuta Icarax was a warrior more than anything else, to the point he was deemed too violent and bloodthirsty even by their standards and chafed under the plan of his leader Makuta Teridax for supposedly involving more scheming than it did dominating. His Establishing Character Moment in the novels contains a quote that might as well be the _creed_ of every Proud Warrior Race Guy, rivaling Conan's own.
        
        _"I believe in certainties. The strength of my limbs, the power of my mask, the sharp edges of my blades — that is what I build my plans around. Trickery, deception, complex strategies, they are for the weak! If you want power, and another has it, you get it not by outwitting him — you get it by stepping over his corpse."_
        

    Visual Novels 

-   _Last Chance in Xollywood_: Defied by Maz, the movie's star, who comes from Zoberon, a planet of warmongering aliens that have no real concept of entertainment outside of fights to the death. He is mostly interested in being an actor (and wants to dabble in comedy, too) and hopes that working in the film industry will make Zoberonians realize that there's more to life than fighting. His sister Uz as well uses her fighting expertise for being Last Chance's stunt coordinator.

    Web Animation 

-   The Worf equivalent in _Star Wreck_, Dwarf, and his race, the Plingons.

    Webcomics 

-   _El Goonish Shive_: This comic features Mr. Verres successfully negotiating with some manner of alien proud warrior race leader who agrees to take his "deathless army of rage" and "rampage in search of enlightenment" elsewhere.
-   _Enemy Quest_: The Warriors live up to their name, being large, red skinned, four armed bruisers with a cultural focus on competitiveness. During the Visitor's war with humanity, Warriors were noted for putting on brass armor, charging through hails of bullets, and killing with their bare hands.
-   The Jägermonsters from _Girl Genius_, who are an army of humans mutated into supersoldiers by the Heterodyne family, and loyal first and foremost _to_ the Heterodyne family. In addition to their long lives, prodigious strength, and accent-inducing fangs, they appear to have built a religion... around hats. If a Jaeger is wearing a hat, especially a nice hat, it had better be one he (or she) won in combat.

-   _Homestuck_: The trolls — although the only ones important to the story haven't been fielded yet, being the equivalent of thirteen years old, there isn't really any other word to describe a society in which everyone above a certain age leaves their birth planet and joins the military. Oddly, each and every one of the trolls we see in-story is actually a social or societal reject for one reason or another, and the majority of them would probably be culled long before they were ever recruited.
-   _Outsider_: The Loroi, unusually for Space Elves, are first and foremost a warrior civilization. They respect martial values and skill above all other things — to them, military strength and individual combat prowess are the highest values civilization is measured by — and their society strongly reflects that. The Loroi Empire is an archetypal army with a nation: its civilian economy is almost entirely in place to support the military, and Loroi civilians have considerably less power and political clout than the warrior class, which is the one that runs the empire. Even in the military, influence is based on one's role in combat, if any — soldiers and pilots are broadly ranked above medics, diplomats and scientists in the Loroi army's complicated organization, while the highest government ranks — the Emperor and her chiefs of staff — are specifically the highest rungs in the space navy's command structure.
-   _PepsiaPhobia_: Phobia is an Amazonian who is very proud of her heritage, especially the warrior aspect. But she later gets kicked out of the Amazon after refusing to get rid of her son.
-   Subverted in _Quentyn Quinn, Space Ranger_. Groonch proudly embraces his supposed warrior race heritage, but he was raised with very little knowledge of his species. The protagonist (of a different species) informs him that only a handful of extinct tribes fit the bill.
-   The Angels in _Slightly Damned_ seem to be alarmingly militarised, so much so that even their artisans are forced into combat.
-   The Galapagos from _Terinu_, being deliberately genetically engineered to be even more aggressive than humans by their creator. The lead Galapados, General Gisko, subverts this trope slightly, being shown to be a loving and gentle husband at home who frets over his wife's pregnancy.
-   The Azatoth in _Terra_ have a heavily militaristic culture believing in Asskicking Leads to Leadership, though the exact angle of the trope varies heavily by individual. Main cast member Agrippa Varus focuses on the "Proud", with a strong sense of personal honor and no tolerance for attacking civilians. Apparent Big Bad Solus Kalar is an Azatoth-supremacist Well-Intentioned Extremist advocating the use of biological warfare against humanity. His underling Catella Myrha is pretty much just a fight-happy bitch.
-   The Antreyki from _Triquetra Cats_, anthropomorphic Proud Warrior Race which demands all members at a certain age enlist in the military.
-   The Basitins from _TwoKinds_. Their military prowess is rather nullified by their paranoia, xenophobia and extreme prudishness, all of which keep their population small, isolated, and begging to be wiped out.

    Web Video 

-   _The Templin Institute_: The video "Why the 'Proud Warrior Race' is Doomed to Extinction" analyzes the characteristics of such societies, determining why, while they may have considerable success in more primitive ages, as technology progresses they find themselves more and more outdated. The video opines that the only way for them to survive is to evolve into a "militarist society", with a strong central government, ability to utilize new technologies as they become available and an industrial and scientific infrastructure capable of backing up the military.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_ episode "Win, Lose and Kaboom", features an Orc-like race called Gorlocks. Jimmy and one of them fall in love with each other.
-   In the _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ universe, citizens of the Fire Nation are taught that the other three elements, water, air, and earth, are inferior to fire, and hold their users in lower esteem than firebenders. They are also a martial culture, where almost everyone serves in the military, and obedience to the state is taught in the national school curriculum. Although originally presented as villains in the show, it is later on revealed that firebenders are more nuanced and complicated. Regardless, they generally have short tempers and enjoy settling issues through combat.
    -   It should be noted that, unlike other examples, they have a very rich culture that does not focus 100% on war, and most likely after 100 years of war their culture has become much more belligerent.
    -   The Water Tribes are also a culture based around warrior-hood. When a tribesman comes of age, they go through a series challenges to prove themselves warriors. Sokka himself underwent this rite of passage and proved himself.
    -   In the first few episodes, this actually seemed to be Sokka's defining trait, though it was later overshadowed by others. By Word of God's own admission, his personality changed for the better due to Jack De Sena's voice acting.
-   _Beast Wars_:
    -   Dinobot is a Noble Demon with a code of honor, despite the fact that he's the only member of his race who acts that way. Nobody ever mentioned this on the show, though... Presumably, they knew better than to say so within earshot of Dinobot.
    -   Some of the other Predacons do have shades of this as well, but in a more Blood Knight sort of way.
    -   The Predacons we see are part of Megatron's crew, and only Dinobot (soldier) and Megatron (general) are true Pred military types. Other than that, we only see Ravage and the Tripredacus council.
-   _Ben 10_ series: The four-armed alien race known as the Tetramands, with the twist on this trope being that their women are the strongest warriors of all<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and thus the men court women by defeating them in combat. _Nearly everything else_ in their culture is also solved by fighting.
-   _Fangbone!_ has the Skullbanians (of which the title character is one), whose entire hat are that they are Barbarian Tribes who live to fight monsters, go on quests, and attain glory in battle. Most of their customs and traditions involve fighting or violence in some way.
-   _Futurama_:
    -   The Omicronians are basically the shows parody of the Klingons. While they do invade planets, they are willing to reason with others. Lrrr especially fits this as seen in "Spanish Fry" when its revealed that he had a soft spot for small creatures and was willing to protect a bigfoot animal from a camp ranger. Their culture is basically built around the idea of war and have traits similar to Spartans.
    -   The Carcarons are also a proud warrior race. They like the omicronians, have an honor filled warlike culture and are also willing to reason with others. Their members only got angry and turned hostile when Zapp Brannigan tried to screw them over on a peace treaty by tricking them into signing a declaration of war.
-   Most traditional _Gargoyles_ are like this, with Goliath being the most notable, showing himself to be both a powerful warrior and a deeply honorable individual. For a more antagonistic example, the Vikings from the first two episodes are a thoroughly unpleasant bunch lead by vicious Blood Knight Hakon.
-   Hawkgirl from _Justice League_. As we see in the Christmas Episode, her idea of celebration involves starting a Bar Brawl. Wonder Woman and Aquaman are borderline cases. Basically, Wonder Woman and Aquaman are _royalty_ from Proud Warrior Races, while Hawkgirl is a _warrior_ from a Proud Warrior Race.
-   The appropriately named Warmonga and Warhok of the Lorwardians (Get it?) in _Kim Possible_.
-   In the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ episode "Hearth's Warming Eve", the ancestors of the pegasi (a mish-mash of ancient Greek, Spartan, Roman, and conquistador imagery) are depicted as such a culture, exemplified by their domineering, militaristic leader Commander Hurricane, who even describes his/her people as "a mighty tribe of warriors". (And does Rainbow Dash _ever_ play it up.) A large number of the pegasi with speaking parts in the present day also seem to be part of the military in some capacity, suggesting they haven't entirely shed this characterization.
    -   The Dragons also tend towards this characterization, with all of them eager to show off their strength, reluctant to admit weakness, and obsessed with competition and dominance.
-   Larry Niven's Kzinti were imported to the Trek universe in _Star Trek: The Animated Series._
-   The New Mandalorians in _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ repeatedly emphasize that they _used_ to be this, but have renounced such ways. Death Watch leader Pre Vizsla and his men, on the other hand, are determined to live up to their ancestors' legacy. After a bit of Engineered Heroics by Death Watch the general population solidly rejected pacifism and returned to the old ways en masse, both the join Death Watch and to fight them.
-   Deconstructed in _Star Wars Rebels_, as Mandalore's infighting and backstabbing made it easy for the Empire to manipulate, divide, and exploit them until they were too scattered to fight back against the Empire, subjugating the entire culture save for a few quislings who became their lackeys in exchange for power. And even then, most of them are still too caught up in power struggles and old rivalries to form any sort of resistance. Sabine, one of the main characters and the most prominent Mandalorian, is proud of her heritage but also critical of its flaws. Her discovery of the darksaber, an artifact that would unite the Mandalorians, and her search to find the right person to wield it, indicates that things might be heading towards reconstruction... until _The Mandalorian_ gave this a Happy Ending Override.
-   The Triceratons on _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)._
-   _Teen Titans (2003)_ has Starfire and her fellow Tamaraneans, though as mentioned above, the TV version of Starfire herself is a Genki Girl. Of course, bad guys who have underestimated her have found out that she hasn't forgotten where she came from. When she gets to fully cut loose, it's a thing of beauty.
-   The Iop race from _Wakfu_ has a rather scrap-happy culture, to the point that even the deity for which their race was named liked duking out matters on the mortal plane so much that it decided to stay there as a physical incarnation who, as it turns out, was Sadlygrove in this particular incarnation. Iops in general are often derided by the other races for being all brawn and no brain, and they tend to be delighted to find themselves in fights even when the odds are stacked suicidally against them. Adding to this, the fact that Sadlygrove proposed to Eva with a set of engagement _knuckledusters_ seems to place another layer of cultural significance to the Iops' boisterousness. Come Season 3, Elely, Sadlygrove and Eva's daughter proved to be a physical powerhouse in and of herself, despite being a very young child. Of course, how much of this is down to her divine heritage is up to debate, though, either way, it's pretty clear that she takes very much after her father.
