_"Well, while I can appreciate your classic look, I don't think anyone has been scared of the 'bedsheet phantasm' ensemble for a long time."_

Our Ghosts Are Different, and they look like refugees from the linens aisle.

If ghosts in Western media aren't dressed as the deceased did in life, then chances are they're dressed as the deceased did in death. Originally, this meant grave clothes and a long, white, flowing burial shroud. Of course, if the same reasoning were applied to modern burial customs, this would mean that most of today's ghosts would be attired in their Sunday best, but the trope is seen as much too cheesy in the present day to be updated in such a logical manner.

Like many images common to modern culture, the Bedsheet Ghost began as a theatrical convention that has long since lost its context. In Shakespeare's day, it was common to portray ghosts in armor on stage (this is why Hamlet's father is often depicted in a full suit of armor in historical depictions.) In Elizabethan England, armor was no longer worn in combat, and the costuming convention at the time was to dress characters in contemporary (Renaissance) clothing. So, by dressing a ghost in armor, the character was given an out-of-date look, and recognized _as_ a ghost by audiences. However, as special effects became more elaborate, it became common to lower the actor playing the ghost onto stage with a pulley. Of course, the heavy armor clanked loudly, and by the 19th century, the sight of an armored ghost on stage was more likely to bring laughter than fear.

Because of this, by the 1800s, theatres realized they had to create a new, recognizable look for ghost characters, one that would allow the actor to enter and leave silently. Perhaps inspired by traditional burial shrouds or depictions of ghosts as ethereal, misty creatures (both attributes predating the Bedsheet Ghost), actors began to appear draped in white cloth to portray ghosts.

Over time, as the shroud became emblematic of the ghost, ghosts were depicted as less corporeal by showing the shroud without a body underneath it. Some stories even go one step further by showing the ghost as a wispy blob of ectoplasm, vaguely shroud-like in appearance, à la Casper the Friendly Ghost.

As a result, the white sheet has become pop culture's visual shorthand for spirits of the dead, and a bedsheet with eye holes is the standard costume for fictional characters trying to dress like ghosts. This idea dates back at least to the Post-U.S. Civil War period—the white robes and hoods of the Ku Klux Klan were intended to look ghostly. (This Klan connection, in turn, is why the pointy-headed Bedsheet Ghost is no longer a popular design.)

The Klan aside, dressing up as a Bedsheet Ghost is usually indicative of an ill-conceived or apathetic scare attempt, because on their own, a person in a white sheet really isn't that scary to anyone over 6 years old. Like the armored ghost before it, the Bedsheet Ghost has long lost its fright appeal, and is mostly comical today. This in turn has led to a common subversion: The characters see what seems to be a person in a white sheet, laugh at the obvious costume, and then lift the sheet to see there's no one underneath it. Cue running and screaming. However some have managed to make it somewhat less funny looking and more intimidating, such as putting red paint on the sheet to make it look bloody.

While the Bedsheet Ghost is rarely played straight as an attempt to _scare_ the audience, it can still work as a mournful, sympathetic figure. The imagery also seems to have evolved into the design of ghosts as disembodied cloaks or robes with hooded faces, who still tend to be treated as spooky figures due to the whole "Grim Reaper" parallel.

Definitely Truth in Television for anyone who's celebrated Halloween: If you haven't dressed as a bedsheet ghost at some point, you know someone who has. Unless you're from the Deep South.

Sub-trope of Stock Costume Traits. Compare Jacob Marley Apparel, Ethereal White Dress and Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl (the rather violent Japanese parallel). Not to be confused with a scene wherein a ghost crawls up from underneath the bedsheet and gets you while you lie on the bed. Usually unconnected to Modesty Bedsheet.

The trapper pulls off the "bedsheet" to see who's underneath... and there is nothing there, except for a small point of light which vanishes, at which point the trapper is attacked by the now-invisible ghost which then proceeds to re-materialize another bedsheet around itself.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   In _An American Ghost Story_ there is another straight (and frightening) example. Unusual in that the character interacts with the thing for an entire nervewracking scene and it remains scary without ever revealing anything under the sheet (though at one point nothing is revealed under the sheet in an unusual way).
-   Lampshaded in the film version of _Beetlejuice_. The Maitlands actually are ghosts, and have the ability to manipulate their appearance into grotesque forms, and manipulate material objects as well. However, they're completely invisible to everyone except Lydia, so in an attempt to scare the Deetzes out of their old house, they put on bedsheets so they would be visible. This does not turn out to be as scary as they'd hoped. It doesn't help their case that they use floral-patterned designer sheets owned by the Deetzes.

-   Subverted in _Ghostbusters (2016)_, when the characters order the main villainous ghost to appear as something "small and friendly". He turns into a cute copy of the Bedsheet Ghost from the franchise's logo... and then swells up into a Kaiju and starts smashing the city.

-   The attorney's little daughters in the 1966 farce _Hotel Paradiso_ discuss the rumors they've heard that the hotel is haunted. Remembering a Halloween play, they put on sheets, circle around and sing. Hysteria ensues.

    Folklore and Mythology 

-   Egyptian Mythology: The Egyptian Book of the Dead makes reference to an obscure deity known as Medjed, who for some reason is depicted as a person wearing an enormous veil that covers everything but his eyes and legs, making him look look like a man in a cheap ghost costume. Also, he had Eye Beams.
-   In the early 1960s several people in and around the town of Kinderhook, New York reported seeing a floating white sheet-like entity that hovered in the air. One person who claimed to have seen it likened it to the Virgin Mary. While none of the witnesses outright stated that it was a ghost, the descriptions bear an uncanny resemblance to this trope.

    Literature 

-   Oscar Wilde's short story "The Canterville Ghost" originally popularized this trope.
-   The Montague Rhodes James short story "Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad" has... well, _something_ that manifests itself in the sheets of the unused bed in the narrator's hotel room. It's implied that the thing has next to no physical form of its own.
    -   The TV adaptation plays it straight _and_ makes it work.
        -   There's something darkly comical about it all. The narrator, Parkins, is a po-faced academic who has very definite views on ghosts (namely, that they don't exist), so it's deliciously ironic that the thing that terrorizes him chooses to manifest itself in a bedsheet. Not that it makes the story any less terrifying.
-   In one of _Bag of Bones_'s Imagine Spots, the protagonist imagines his wife's ghost visiting him "wrapped in a tattered burial shroud." Stephen King manages to make it scary.
-   One of the solve-it-yourself mysteries of the _Clue_ books features Mr. Boddy's six guests all dressing up as ghosts to try to scare each other, which makes them all feel a little silly— until they notice there are _seven_ ghosts in the room, and one of them doesn't have feet.
-   Clive Barker's "Confessions of a (Pornographer's) Shroud" uses this as an intentionally ridiculous core premise for what can either be read as a fairly serious horror story or a black comedy. The main character manages to come back as a ghost by transferring his spirit from his body to the shroud used to cover him at the morgue.
-   In the _Dora the Explorer_ picture book _Dora's Halloween Adventure_, Dora and Boots encounter one of these in a "haunted house," but it turns out to actually be Swiper in costume.
-   _Dr. Greta Helsing_: The "Whistlers" from Montague Rhodes James appear as eerie but Non Malicious Monsters who manifest out of nearby fabric when their Haunted Fetter whistle is blown. Greta wins one as an enthusiastic ally by offering to hide its whistle somewhere interesting for it to haunt, although even she is a bit unnerved when it curiously feels out her face.
-   In the book _Franklin's Halloween_ and the associated television story from _Franklin_, it's said that Franklin and his friends know that Bear always wears this as his Halloween costume, so when Franklin gets to the Halloween party, he doesn't have to worry about trying to figure out who Bear is, even underneath all the disguises. He and his friends get tricked, however, because while there is one of these at the party, it's not Bear, who is home sick with a cold. It turns to be their teacher, Mr. Owl, who heard that Bear was at home and decided to play a trick on all of them.
-   In Clifford D. Simak's _The Goblin Reservation_, the character of Ghost (yes, that's how he's called) is depicted this way.

-   This is Big Bird's disguise in the _Sesame Street_ picture book _Who's Afraid of Monsters?_ It gets a good scare out of everyone until they figure out it's him.
-   In the _Star Wars_ picture book, _Are You Scared, Darth Vader?_ by Adam Rex, this is one of the many things that a kid tries and fails to scare Darth Vader with. Vader just wonders if it's the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi or Yoda, not that he'd be scared even if it was, and declares "Next!" when told that it's just a ghost.
-   In _Wyrd Sisters_, Lord Felmet has finally suffered enough Sanity Slippage throughout the events of the novel to go completely mad, and believes he is a ghost. He dons a sheet and goes on about how he plans to rattle chains and frighten people...while Death stands there and politely insists he is _not_ dead. Felmet ends up slipping off a parapet and falling to his death. His _actual_ ghost, still wearing the sheet, is now allowed to haunt the place for real.

Billy and the kids are startled for a second, then they burst out laughing.
-   In the Halloween Episode of _Power Rangers Dino Charge_, the Rangers all go to a party dressed as this. This is actually important to the plot; Sledge's minions kidnap one of the Rangers in costume, one of them uses their powers to replicate the Ranger's memories and another turns the first monster into a clone of the Ranger. The fake, still in costume, returns to the base along with the real Rangers, and Kendall has to Bluff the Impostor.
-   Subverted in _Pushing Daisies_ where in a flashback, young Ned is shown on Halloween in a sheet with fire engines on it. However, Chuck shows up in a white sheet later that episode.
-   Low-budget sci-fi serial _Rocky Jones, Space Ranger_ brings us one of the stupidest examples. A Fat, Sweaty Southerner in a White Suit IN SPACE! is trying to steal the land rights to some sort of space gold-mine, and is thwarted not by the Space Rangers, but by a couple of kids throwing a sheet over their remote-control airplane so he thinks it's a ghost. Keep in mind, this is hundreds of years in the future, in a civilization on par with _Star Trek_...

-   The Vincent Price episode of _The Muppet Show_ has a group of ghosts resembling translucent sheets floating in mid-air, with black holes for the eyes and mouths, who tell ghost jokes and sing "I'm Looking Through You."

    Radio 

-   _Our Miss Brooks_: Walter Denton dresses up as a ghost in the episode _Halloween Party_.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   As mentioned in the Head Injury Theater quote on the quotes page, the sheet phantom is an actual Bedsheet Ghost. As with some of the other actual Bedsheet Ghosts, the explanation given is that the being's spirit is imbued into his bedclothes as he dies.
    -   The death linen, another _AD&D_\-era monster, is actually a subversion - they aren't undead, but animated by "latent psychic forces born of nightmares," making them closer to psychic-type poltergeist activity.
    -   Undead cloakers from the _Ravenloft_ setting somewhat resemble this trope, although they were never human, but ghosts of creatures that resemble flying manta rays.
    -   The demon lord Pale Night _looks_ like this trope, being a seductive female figure wrapped in a white veil blowing on a spectral wind that occasionally shifts enough to _almost_ reveal what's underneath it. But though she is incorporeal, she's an eons-old obyrith, not an undead, and the sheet is suspected to be a sort of cosmic censor to protect existence from the horror of her true form. One of her special abilities is to briefly reveal the truth beyond that veil, which is a "save or die" attack.
-   In _Warhammer_, some of the oldest pewter models to represent Undead Spirit Hosts depicted traditional bedsheet ghosts. Other players figured out that it was cheaper to buy plastic models and paint them ghostly gray and white, especially if those models came from a rival's army range.

    Theatre 

-   In _Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol_, Marley's initial idea on how to scare Scrooge is as a bedsheet ghost. The Bogle snidely comments he's pretty scary as-is.
-   It's Older Than Feudalism: _Julius Caesar_: "The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets."
    -   Bear in mind that coffins hadn't caught on yet; Bedsheet Ghosts were in their burial shrouds.

    Toys

-   Eleanor from Living Dead Dolls is a ghost wearing her burial sheet with a Ghostly Gape underneath.
-   Playmobil also had shrouds for their figures, with only eye holes for the figure to see through. The child-size shroud has a pointed head, but the adult shrouds are rounded. While they have the traditional white ghost, a black ghost with a glowing yellow face has also been made. A new figure piece that lights up was also introduced, with flowier "robes", but no standard figure inside.

    Video Games 

-   The True Final Boss of _Aero Fighters 2_ is a tablecloth ghost.
-   Aughosto from _Alchademy_ is a little ghost with a white robe and hood.
-   Bedsheet ghosts feature in _Baba is You_ as one of the many objects that can be found in levels.
-   In _Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle_, the "ghost" which Morgane arranges for Dinsdale and Mitchell to see looks like this, because a bedsheet is exactly what it is. It contrasts sharply with the real ghost which Morgane stumbles on immediately after her trick, which looks more ghoulish.
-   The pet sites _Celestial Vale_ and _Valley of Unicorns_ have a unicorn in a bedsheet ghost costume as a limited-edition pet.
-   A certain variety of mook in the _Donkey Kong 64_ world "Creepy Castle". The game doesn't even pretend that they're really ghosts; they're officially called "Kritters\-in-a-sheet".
-   _Family House_ centers around fixing up an old house that was once a stately mansion, centuries ago. It is hosted by the bedsheet ghost who, when he was alive, was the head butler there.
-   Nitocris dons one of these in her Assassin persona in _Fate/Grand Order_. Funnily, despite her "underworld" association, she's not going for this look, but the Egyptian god Medjed, who looks uncannily like a bedsheet ghost. She thinks it conceals her identity and depicts her as a foreboding harbinger of the afterlife, but it really just makes her look like a goofball, not least because her ears are poking out of the top.
-   In _Final Fantasy VI_, the "??????" character or "Ghost" that can temporarily join your party on the Phantom Train has the appearance of this, as do the other ghosts on the train that aren't so friendly.
-   In _Geist_, this strategy actually _works_ on someone, scaring her enough to allow you to possess her. It's a bit scarier than usual, although the accountant literally sees the sheet rise up off the bed. Raimi-as-a-bedsheet-ghost has an empty dark hood and dives after her, after all.
-   The Sega Genesis version of _Ghostbusters (1990)_ uses this in the form of white _tablecloth_ ghosts. As in: the tablecloth floats off the table, comes toward you, and "ties you up" if you don't eliminate it.
-   _GhostControl Inc._ has these as an enemy type you can encounter in the game. They're called "Halloween Spirits".
-   You actually get to _play_ as one of these in the Self-Explanatory Adventure Game _Ghost in the Sheet_. Justified in that his "boss" tells him that if the sheet's taken off, what's left of him will scatter away and be lost forever (He died under an incoming bus, which was "very messy"). Actually, the "boss" put the sheet on his definitely-not-fragmented body in order to prevent him from phasing through objects and getting too much information. It doesn't work, of course, as he still manages to _get_ said info...
-   You encounter scary red ghosts as Cute Giana, in _Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams_. However, the less fearful Punk Giana only sees goofy-looking ghosts with patched up bedsheets.
-   _Haunted Halloween '86: The Curse Of Possum Hollow_: When Donny and Tami meet a bunch of kids on Halloween before trick or treating starts, one of them is dressed up as a ghost, while her ponytail is visible.
-   One of the puzzles from _Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis_ had Indy dressing up as a bedsheet ghost to try to scare another character. It didn't work very well until the bed sheet was supplemented with some other items.
-   In _Jumper Three_, a ghost bedsheet is one of the buyable clothes for Ogmo in stage 2-5.
-   The Phantom, one of the optional bosses in _Kingdom Hearts_ takes on this look.
-   One monster in _Kingdom of Loathing_'s FantasyRealm dungeon is haunted by a mob called a Spooky Ghost. It's just a theme park actor wearing a sheet (he's categorized as a human rather than an undead monster), but he's so dedicated to the role that he has the strengths and weaknesses of a ghost regardless.
-   _Kirby: Squeak Squad_: Kirby can unlock a "Ghost" ability where takes on this kind of appearance and can possess enemies.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   Most depictions of the Poe enemy depict it as a short figure draped in sheets, with glowing eyes and spindly arms and carrying a lantern.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda_: The manual depicts the ghostly Ghini enemies as animated bedsheets with leering faces.
-   _Matchington Mansion_: Rex dresses up as one in an ill-conceived attempt to scare Tiffany into selling him the mansion.
-   The ghosts in _Megaman Sprite Game_ resemble these, complete with the webcomic's Stylistic Suck facial design.
-   _Millie And Molly_: Enemies encountered in the spooky levels include ghosts who look like cloths with eyeholes. They can be defeated by walking into them.
-   The Ghost robe is one of the robes for Clerics in _Miitopia_ can wear, and it makes them look like a bedsheet ghost.
-   The ghost mooks from _Monster Hunter (PC)_ resembles ghosts in sheets and carrying chains.
-   The spectres of _OFF_ often take this form.
-   The ghosts from _Pac-Man_ are even further abstracted. They look like jellyfish with eyeballs. The second and third cutscenes in the original game demonstrate this: in the second, Blinky chases Pac only to catch his ghost suit on a nail, and in the third, he chases Pac again, but his crappy repair job didn't stay. In both instances, we see part of the creature under the costume. Technically they weren't supposed to be ghosts in 1980, just generic "monsters", but players all called them "ghosts" because of their resemblance to the stereotypical form of the trope.
-   In the second _Painkiller_, the enemies in the wonderfully creepy orphanage level include children playing as bedsheet ghosts. Do not let them to get close to you.
-   Konami's MSX game _Pippols_ has bedsheet-looking ghosts among the enemies. They can freely move through walls.
-   One of the transformations in _Pizza Tower_ is a ghost transformation that resembles a bedsheet. Strangely, when the player is transformed back to normal, the bedsheet falls away.
-   _Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time_: The Ghost Pepper resembles one of these. Apparently, it's her Halloween party costume, but she likes it too much.
-   _Pokémon Sun and Moon_ plays with this in the form of Mimikyu, a Ghost/Fairy type. While it's alive as any other Pokemon, a Mimikyu is hurt by sunlight, and so perpetually wears a sheet to protect itself. The play comes from the fact that their sheets are old Pikachu merchandise; Mimikyu want the same popularity among humans, and so they try to get others' attention via the impersonation. It figures into their special ability, Disguise: other Pokémon mistake the Mimikyu's stuffed Pikachu head for a real head and so miss an attack (the actual Mimikyu, as evidenced by eyes in the "chest", is a few inches shorter than the disguise). Taking a peek under Mimikyu's sheet causes the viewer such shock that he/she might die from it.
-   Invoked in _Puyo Puyo_ with the ghost twins Yu and Rei, who wear pure white cloaks. Yu believes no one would recognize them as ghosts otherwise. Dapper Bones thinks they could defy this and wear something else, though.
-   A vehicular example in _Re-Volt_ : The secret Mystery car, which is just a sheet with some question marks written on it. Flipping it over reveals that there isn't actually a car underneath the sheet.

-   _RuneScape_ does this twice. Once with a green bedsheet (to fit in with green ghosts) and once with regular bedsheets for a Christmas Carol parody.
-   You find some of these in the third level of _The Simpsons_ arcade game. Of course, you'll quickly notice they "float" from a rather visible rope coming out of a tree. Once you knock them down, they'll be revealed as your standard mook.
-   In _Sonic and Knuckles_, Sandopolis Zone Act II featured bedsheet ghosts that appeared as the torches burned down. To start with would be one small one, floating at the top of the screen in a less-than-threatening manner. Then a second one appears and they grow in size and their eyes gain an angry look. When the torches go out completely a third one appears, and all three get bigger and grow horns. If the torches are left off for too long they start swooping down and menacing Sonic. Since the level contains a section where it's very easy to get stuck in a loop and remain stuck well after you've realized you're IN a loop (or even if you were prepared for the loop), these guys can get a little distressing.
-   This is an enemy added to the Endless mode of _Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion_. Named "Spooper", he looks like a guy in pretty bad bedsheet costume, with normal looking legs poking out and who just blocks the door to the next room. And the only way to get him out of the way you have to hit him with your axe. But then you'll find him in the next room, his disguise slightly torn and bloodied. You must do the same. And as you keep going and his disguise falls appart, you'll discover than he's less human than he appears...
-   _Super Gear Quest_: The Scaresheet, Scareface and Scareround enemies in the Haunted Chateau level are three different kinds of this. Scaresheet looks more sheet than ghost and moves up and down on a fixed path, Scareface chases the player and Scareround is a bigger, dopey-looking version of Scareface.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   Broozers are enemies introduced in _New Super Mario Bros._, and since then, they become semi-recurrent enemies in the series. They resemble humanoids wearing a bedsheet over their body, brown shoes and boxing gloves, and when they see the player, they attack punching anything in their way, which can be useful for destroying unbreakable bricks, allowing the player to reach items and Star Coins that could not otherwise be reached. While they aren't actual ghosts, since you can defeat them with Goomba Stomps, they mainly appear in Ghost House levels.
    -   _Super Mario 3D Land_ introduces a species of ghost called Peepas, who are a Super-Deformed version of this trope.
    -   The series also has Lantern Ghosts, that are Shy Guys under a bedsheet. They appear in _Yoshi's Island_, and a larger variant appears as a mid-boss in _Paper Mario 64_.
    -   The Duplighosts in _Paper Mario_ are literal bedsheet ghosts who can transform into dopplegangers of your partners. In the sequel _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_, there's a unique one known as Doopliss, who transforms the citizens of Twilight Town into pigs. He is more humorous than scary, but he's a lot more dangerous than he seems.
-   Zepheniah Mann of _Team Fortress 2_ haunts the map Harvest in this form, with a jaunty little ghostly...er, Ghastly Gibus on his incorporeal head. As part of a Running Gag (Valve's attempts at injecting horror into TF2 are all Stylistic Suck), the player characters are absolutely _terrified_ of him, screaming and dropping their weapons for five seconds if he gets too close.
    -   In the 2013 Halloween Event, all players have the potential to become bedsheet ghosts (who can only move around and moan "Boo!") should they die in Helltower once Redmond or Blutarch reaches the end of the payload race and open the portal to the afterlife.

-   The boy who controls Spectre in _Twisted Metal: Small Brawl_ appears dressed as this.
-   Napstablook from _Undertale_ resembles this kind of ghost. They enjoy recorded music in the "spooky" genre.
-   _Uninvited_ specifically invokes this, with a ghost who, according to the narration, "looks like the classic spectre" that comes out of the sky and kills you.
-   _Wario Land_:
    -   The ghost enemies in _Wario Land II_ that turn Wario into a zombie if he touches them.
    -   The Axe Ghosts in _Wario Land 4_ are pretty much this... with the pointy hood style that's gone out of fashion for most other media.
-   _Wizard101_ has these as enemies throughout the game, and they come in a variety of colors. Most notably, this is the model used by the lost souls, famous for being the weakest monsters in the game.
-   _The Wolf and the Waves_: Blue mushrooms give you a "recon mode" that looks like a bedsheet ghost.
-   _You Are Not The Hero_: During her travels, Petula fights a "Big Freakin Ghost" on board a haunted train. It's a giant black bed sheet with glowing red eyes.

-   In _Dear Children_, the supernaturally\-obsessed Cailin Carver loves pictures of these creatures.
-   Mort from _Gunnerkrigg Court_. He takes the form of whatever he thinks is likely to scare his latest victim, and uses the default translucent "bedsheet phantasm" appearance as a sort of indication that he's in "friendly ghost" mode ever since Antimony pointed out that no one's been scared of the linen apparition since they went from burial shrouds to bedsheets. A flashback episode to his death reveals that he chose the look because "If I'm a ghost, I suppose I better look the part. I dressed up as a ghost once. With a bedsheet and everything!"
-   _The Non-Adventures of Wonderella_: The ghost from "You Can't Always Get What You HAUNT".

-   The _SCP Foundation_ features a characteristically dark version in SCP-6096, a bedsheet ghost which is normally passive but every so often picks out a person at random, hunts them down and kills them. Unlike a number of similar SCPs, it isn't outwardly indestructible, amazingly strong, or otherwise empowered; rather, it can't be stopped because _everyone_ who interacts with it, besides the target themselves, is compelled to help it reach its victim, and nobody is able to bring themselves to take actions which would hinder or harm it. In fact, the SCP Foundation itself was _compelled to give it a dedicated MTF team specifically to help it,_ with its containment procedures simply being to let it track down its target when active and then do damage control after because it's fundamentally impossible to try and contain it. Even attempting to disband the MTF would count as attempting to hinder it now, so the agents are stuck.
-   In the _SuperMarioLogan_ episode, "Bowser's Change!", Junior steals $100.00 from Chef Pee Pee that Bowser gave him to buy a pizza with so that he could buy _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_, only for Joseph to spend the money on candy and a lottery ticket (which he lost on). After Junior tricks Tyrone into giving him into the pizza for free, Chef Pee Pee forces him to explain to Bowser why he doesn't have the change he was expecting, so he lies to him that he tipped the pizza guy $80.00 because he was a ghost and didn't want him to spook them. When Bowser wants to see the ghost as proof, Junior disguises himself as a ghost using his _Thomas & Friends_ bedsheet. Bowser still falls for Junior's trick despite the fact that the characters from _Thomas_ are clearly visible on the bedsheet, but Junior's ruse is exposed when Bowser tries to give him a hug.

-   In a Halloween Episode of _Creepschool_, this is Victoria's Halloween costume. Unlike other examples featured on this page, Becoming the Costume is in effect causing her to gain the abilities of a ghost such as flying and intangibility.
-   One of Vlad's bad clones of _Danny Phantom_ looks like a Bedsheet Ghost... because the sheet covers up its _horrifying_ mutations (like the fact that it has no _legs_, _muscle_, or _skin_).
    
    **Danny**: Seriously, a _bedsheet_? \[_Reaches out for the bedsheet._\] What do you got under there? \[_Removes bedsheet to reveal a ghost that only has the upper portion of a skeleton._\]
    
    -   Also, Danny tried pulling off the Bedsheet Ghost look during _Fright Night_. It didn't work out.

-   _Dorg Van Dango_: Yooki is one of these. In her original form (seen briefly in the intro) she looked like a dirty patchwork bedsheet. However, her disguised form still looks like a sheet, this time much cleaner with no visible stiches, a purple frill along the bottom, and some Girlish Pigtails for good measure.
-   _Duckman_ has a surprise cameo from the last person you would expect pulling this. Homer Simpson. Since Klasky-Csupo _**DID**_ have a hand in the production of _The Simpsons_, It Makes Sense in Context.
-   The ghosts in _Eek! The Cat_'s Halloween Episode are of this variety. Although the ghost that Eek befriends is more like a stray party balloon.
-   _Felix the Cat_ has encountered a few of these over the years;
    -   In a classic-era short, _Felix the Ghost Breaker_, Felix is haunted by a ghost that looks like this, and then has to save a farmer from it. It turns out to just be a "Scooby-Doo" Hoax, as the ghost is just a travelling salesman in disguise.
    -   In the Joe Oriolo era episode "Ghostly Concert", Felix is trapped on a haunted ship, where its revealed Professor is commanding a legion of these kind of ghosts to go after him.
    -   In another Oriolo-era episode, "Redbeard the Pirate", Professor and Rock Bottom dress up as one to scare Felix away from Redbeard the Pirate's gold. Felix quickly catches on to the disguise when he realizes the "ghost" has two heads and four legs. Later on, they open the treasure chest, which releases the real Redbeard's Ghost (who also looks like a bedsheet ghost), who scares Professor and Rock Bottom away.
-   _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_:
    -   Although Bloo is an imaginary friend, his body shape definitely makes him look like this trope.

    -   In "Go Goo Go", Goo is wearing a bedsheet with two eye holes as her Halloween costume.

-   _If You Give a Mouse a Cookie_:
    -   All of the "ghosts" seen in the Halloween Episode "If You Give a Mouse a Pumpkin" are this. In particular, Cat has eight ghost decorations for his Halloween Spooktacular event and Moose dresses up in this costume for Halloween.
    -   In "The Haunted Toolshed," Mouse, Dog, Henry and Esme Louise all believe that there's a ghost in the toolshed, even though it's actually just Moose playing music and otherwise making racket. They finally decide to confront the ghost, but figure the ghost for sure will see them coming. They therefore all dress up as bedsheet ghosts and make ghostly moaning noises to disguise themselves.

-   Used in various episodes of _The Little Lulu Show_. Either by Lulu or Tubby and his friends.
-   On _Little Princess_, this is the King's costume in "I Want to Dress Up." The Queen grumbles that she hopes it's not one of the good bedsheets.
-   In _Llama Llama Trick or Treat_, Officer Flamingo scares the kids as one of these. Well, all of them except Euclid, who isn't scared of ghosts, because "Scientifically speaking, they aren't solid matter."

-   In "Frisky, Fluttery Ghost" from _Mouse and Mole_, Mole misinterprets Mouse's comment that there is "crispy, buttery toast" waiting for him as "frisky, fluttery ghost," then gets scared by thinking that a sheet which Mouse is hanging on a clothesline is one of these.
-   The _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ episode "Look Before You Sleep". Twilight Sparkle tells a Ghost Story about a headless horse and finishes by putting a white bedsheet over her head. Despite the sheet not covering the rest of her body, Rarity and Applejack are immediately fooled.
    -   In the Scare Master episode, A trio of such ghosts pursue the ponies (and Spike) inside the corn maze. It's later revealed those were Fluttershy's bird friends in disguise.

Unfortunately, the trap gets triggered, and Ryder is covered in the sheet, making the pups briefly think he's the ghost, then a victim of the ghost. The "ghost" is then revealed to be Marshall sleepwalking around under a bedsheet, which is foreshadowed by the ghost having Marshall's shape.
-   On _PB&J Otter_, this is Baby Butter's costume in "A Hoohaw Halloween." This type of decoration is also seen throughout the episode.
-   _Peanuts_: This is Charlie Brown's favorite Halloween costume in _It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown_. Of course, being Charlie Brown, he naturally _botches_ said costume with too many eye holes, as Linus did in the actual comic strip.
    -   Oddly enough, these holes are all rendered as black dots of ghostly nothingness rather than simply showing whatever part of him or his regular clothes that's underneath. Presumably because this was easier to animate.
    -   Most of the other kids' costumes are also bedsheet ghosts, with the exception of a few who wear masks on top of bedsheet-ghost outfits.
-   In the _Pixie, Dixie and Mr. Jinks_ cartoon "Ghost With the Most," Mr. Jinks thinks he's killed Dixie, who was playing possum after being hit with a fireplace shovel.

At the conclusion when he finds out the truth, Jinks turns the tables and makes Pixie and Dixie think he committed suicide out of guilt. Jinks dresses up as a bedshhet ghost as well.

-   High-Five Ghost and his family in _Regular Show_. Then it gets...odd when Mordecai and Rigby are turned into ghosts, and they just look like themselves, with a ghostly squiggle instead of legs.

    -   In the first Halloween Episode "Candy Bar Creep Show", when the babies are hiding in Stu and Drew's makeshift haunted house among hearing Angelica and other trick-or-treaters about to enter, a sheet section of the tent falls onto Tommy, and the nearby electric fan that was blowing paper bats around gives the sheet-covered Tommy a more ghostly appearance. This manages to scare Angelica AND Grandpa Lou.
    -   In "Toys in the Attic", Grandpa Boris is trying to find Tommy and Angelica wandering their attic, which they think is haunted. The wind blows the attic window open and sends a white sheet flying onto Grandpa Boris. Naturally, Tommy and Angelica think he is a ghost, and Boris blindly trying to get around with the sheet over him doesn't help much either.
    -   Spoofed in the "Chanukah" special; as an attempt to try and defeat the "Meany of Chanukah," Phil suggests taking Tommy's white pillowcase and wearing it over his head to disguise as a ghost. It doesn't work, and Phil only ends up walking into a table leg.
-   An episode of _Sabrina: The Animated Series_ featured a Yet Another Christmas Carol episode where Aunt Zelda as the Ghost of Christmas Present was dressed as one of these.

-   _South Park_:
    -   In the episode "Here Comes the Neighborhood", the townsfolk wish to drive the rich people (who just happen to all be black) out of town, so they figure: what scares rich people? Ghosts. They then dress up as bedsheet ghosts and wind up looking like The Klan. Hilariously, the rich people also think they look like ghosts and flee the town because it's "hainted".
    -   In "Pink Eye" from the first season, Principal Victoria sees Cartman dressed as Hitler and thinks a Bedsheet Ghost would be a less controversial costume. Er, not so much.

-   In "A View To a Mask" from _Special Agent Oso_, the boy that Oso is helping, Kevin, initially mistakes Oso for being dressed up as one of these when he lands in front of his doorway covered in his parachute. Admittedly, a very odd-looking one.
-   In the episode "Scaredy Pants", _SpongeBob SquarePants_ tries to go as the Flying Dutchman and scare everybody, but his costume consists of a sheet and wooden clogs. Because of his square shape, everyone called him a "haunted mattress", so he asks Patrick to shave his head down to a round shape. He goes to the Halloween party and almost gets away with scaring all his friends, but he is found out eventually. Just then the _real_ Flying Dutchman arrives and, insulted by such a pathetic impersonation, unmasks him. He takes one look at him and runs screaming into the night, followed by everyone else, and eventually Patrick. Seems SpongeBob has been sheared down until there was nothing left but his _brain_.
    
    "Don't worry! It grows back!"
    
    -   In "Pranks a Lot", Spongebob and Patrick trick Sandy into thinking they're ghosts. They wear white bed sheets to make her think it's a cheap costume, but when she pulls them off there's nothing there. She freaks out and jumps into an escape pod to run back to Texas.
