_"Take off all your clothing,_  
_We've only just begun._  
_We have no anesthesia,_  
_It's 1841!"_

The glint of a sharpened scalpel, the whine of a dull, rusty dentist drill, the look of terror on a patient's face when he realizes just what that saw is for. There's something about being helplessly Strapped to an Operating Table, with the surgeons looming over you cutting you up and anesthesia slowly dulling your mind, that seems to have a certain appeal to horror authors. Expect plenty of hypodermic needles, oversized bone saws, and of course the good old lobotomy tools.

Psychological horror, involving soothing happy pills and a nice padded room, also fits in this index. Most of the things here are also Medical Treatment Tropes.
