”Love is in the air! Can't you just smell it?"

_"I'm going to get this \[poison\] analyzed. Then you're going to jail, where you'll be ANAL-yzed!"_

A trope in which it is stated, shown, or implied that detainees may be sexually assaulted while in prison (usually by fellow prisoners but sometimes by their captors).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  It is used in a number of ways:

-   A device for scary violence and revenge scenes in stories with prison settings.
-   A threat for nasty law officers to menace prisoners with during interrogation scenes. ("You know what they'll do to a Pretty Boy like you, son?")
-   An Establishing Character Moment moment carried out by a prisoner or an evil warden to show how evil and threatening they are.
-   An extra (or ironic) punishment for the particularly depraved. Even "good" characters may gloat at the thought of villains receiving their comeuppance in this way, especially if said villains were rapists themselves. A Pariah Prisoner (such as a sexual offender, a snitch, or an ex-cop) might be the victim of a prison rape. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   A source of jokes, often featuring huge criminals wearing eyeshadow or other indicators of queerness.
    -   A joke at the expense of queer stereotypes, implying that they would enjoy it.
    -   And of course an excuse for statements of mock concern, like the ever-popular "Don't drop the soap."
-   A source of fears and hangups for characters who think they may be in danger of incarceration (may be played straight or for laughs).
-   A dark, past trauma that blights the lives of ex-convicts.
-   One of many reasons someone might vow that they're Never Going Back to Prison.

As with all rape tropes, please refrain from listing real life examples. It is entirely sufficient to note that such things do occur.

    Advertising 

-   An anti-drug PSA in the early 90s featured a first-person viewpoint of the arrested drug user, ending with a prison inmate who simply blows a kiss to his new cellmate.
-   There was a 7-Up ad where the guy was making his pitch in a prison. He drops a can at one point and says "I'm not picking that up." And "that's enough being friends." as the cameraman pulls away while a bearded prisoner puts an arm around him.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Alice In Jails_, Victor "comforts" Firo about going to Alcatraz with the knowledge that, what with looking so young and feminine, he'll probably be quite popular there.
    
    **Victor:** Well, what if I told you you'd be popular inside? You're pretty enough I wager you'd be a minor celebrity there in a matter of days. Then again, I suppose the warden over there has things locked down tight enough that nothing like that would really happen, so you don't have to worry.  
    **Firo:** ...Noah, mind if I kill your boss?
    
-   Happens to Ash, the protagonist in _Banana Fish_. The anime is vague about the extent in which he's abused, but the manga confirms that he was gang-raped by three prisoners. It's mostly due to him being young and rather feminine.
-   In the prison arc in _Basara_, it's treated partially as lack of women, but mostly as a simple business transaction about power and dominance.
-   In one arc of _Black Lagoon_, Janet Bhai (a.k.a. Greenback Jane from the earlier Carnival of Killers arc from the manga) suggests she might make a pass on Rock if Revy didn't care for her always banging Benny's brains out. Revy's reaction is not to make a death threat as would be expected of someone hitting Revy's Berserk Button about Rock in general, but to say this, which sheds some rather unsettling light on Revy's prison experience and makes for a really creepy scene.
-   _Cross Ange_: The Arzenal island is more a penal colony than a prison proper, but otherwise fits the bill. Shortly after her arrival Ange is almost raped by Zola, the commander assigned to the first troop, and comments from the other members imply she loves to do this to new recruits regularly.
-   In _Devil May Cry: The Animated Series_ it's strongly hinted that the warden of Devil's Prison gets up to this with the inmates. He also makes sexual advances on Dante, who puts him in his place.
-   _Infinite Ryvius_: Implied when Criff and Michelle are imprisoned after the coup in episode 16. While nothing explicit is shown, there are a few lines of suggestive dialogue and it is seen that Michelle is shackled up with her legs spread.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Steel Ball Run_: It's heavily implied this happened to Funny Valentine's father during his time as a POW.
-   In _Legend of the Blue Wolves_, Captain Continental ties Jonathan up like a prisoner and rapes him.
-   _Let's Start An Inn On The Dungeon Island_ has a rare gender-inverted example that is _not_ Played for Laughs. After the male protagonist, Shirou Sanada arrives in the new world, he was captured by all-female soldiers of Imperial garrison stationed in the island who intends to rape him in the dungeon. Fortunately, they were interrupted by the soldiers' senior officer who wants the offending soldiers to be stationed somewhere else, but it's clear that Shirou still bore the trauma from the experience even many chapters later.
-   _One Piece_: The prisoners in the lowest level of Impel Down are very forward with what they want to do to Boa Hancock.
-   _One-Punch Man_: Puri-Puri Prisoner apparently has a problem with this. Can't hold back with so many handsome evildoers, you see. Or handsome men in general, which is why he imprisoned himself in the first place (breaking out if he needs to fight). If you're good enough and you land in his prison, he'll let you out with just a smooch, thankfully.
-   In _Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin_, the prison doctor Sasaki engages in this quite often, and will scheme with the warden to kill off anyone who finds out.
-   Let's not forget the reference of this in _Sonic X_ with this infamous line:
    
    **Rouge:** I hope we share a cell.
    

    Comedy 

-   Jeff Dunham:
    
    **Peanut:** You'd get your ass sent to jail! And trust me, you would not do good in jail.  
    **Jeff:** Why not?  
    **Peanut:** _\[deep voice\]_ _C'mere, puppet boy. Make yer daddy talk._
    
-   Northern English musical comedian Mike Harding references this possibility in his _Strangeways Hotel_ monologue and song about Manchester's fearsome prison.
-   Richard Pryor in his stand up comedy movie "Live on the Sunset Strip" talks about filming _Stir Crazy_ with Gene Wilder in a real Arizona state penitentiary. Surrounded by real hardened convicts, Wilder asked Richard, "What do you think they'd do to us if we were here, Rich?" Pryor responded: "**Fuck us.**" Wilder protested: "I'm not homosexual!" Richard: "Homosexual ain't got nothin' to do with it! They don't fuck you cuz you like it! They fuck you to see that look on yo' face!"
-   Chris Rock has a bit in _Bring the Pain_ describing an HBO special about prison life. The interviewer is talking to a drug dealer who makes would-be purchasers "toss his salad." The interviewer asks why: "When a man's sucking your dick, he can pretend it's something else. If he's eatin' ass, he **knows** it's ass." Rock goes on to make a few follow-up jokes on the subject of prison rape.
-   Yakov Smirnov: "We have homosexuals in Russia, but none of them gay. Punishment for homosexual in Soviet Russia is ten year locked up in prison with other men... but there is five year waiting list."
-   Christopher Titus alludes to this with a Gag Echo from the start of the set, in which he described being taken away by the police for slapping his then-girlfriend once after she'd punched him in the face five times.
    
    **Titus**: I'm 6'2", I'm tan, I'm blonde, I'm wearing white pants... I'm a very pretty man!
    

    Comic Books 

-   One of the viewpoint characters in _100 Bullets_ is sent to prison at one point. He promptly rapes and kills his cellmate just to make it clear to the other prisoners what sort of man they're dealing with.
-   _Arkham Asylum: Living Hell_: When white-collar crook Warren White is sent to Arkham after pleading insanity to avoid prison time, he quickly finds himself the Pariah Prisoner and is regularly assaulted by other inmates. In a montage depicting his experiences there, one panel shows him being pinned down by another inmate, who is very suggestively licking his face.
-   The villain of _The Authority_'s "Earth Inferno" story arc is an evil magician who has spent decades in prison, and rather banally says he has been raped by almost every guard in the prison. Once he escapes, he travels back in time and molests one of the heroes as a teenager as part of his battle strategy.
-   Killer Moth was apparently the laughing stock in prison for being apprehended by Batgirl, and implies this happened to him as a result.
    -   Or at least that's what somebody claiming to be him says. Two pages later, Babs tells him Killer Moth is locked up in Arkham, and looks nothing like him (or even human).
-   When Kingpin went to jail in a mainstream _Daredevil_ arc by Ed Brubaker, The Enforcers are sent into the showers to do him in in a way it seems to invoke this. ...Kingpin beats them up.
-   Gina experiences the rare Distaff Counterpart in _Gold Digger_, complete with soap-dropping. She remembers not to bend over to pick it up, but kneeling in a women's prison isn't much better. However, the inmates who attempted to molest her crash into a large inmate while chasing after her. The pissed off woman proceeds to violently rape all three of them at once.
-   This has become almost a Dead Horse Trope in _Hellblazer_:
    -   During the story about the Devil's Confession, there is reference to a young hippie being "buggered eleven times on his first night inside," which prompted his attempted suicide.
    -   During the _Son of Man_ Story Arc, John Constantine and Chaz Chandler are pursued by a huge demon called a "fuckpig", supposedly the act of rape given form. John comments that, as the creature is sexually aggressive, massively endowed, and black in color (coal-black, as it happens), this experience could represent prison-rape anxiety. Even though the story was set in London and it's usually U.S. prisons that are depicted as controlled by violent black gangs. He's pretty obviously joking, anyway, as he follows up the comment with "I said it was very Freudian, Chas. I didn't say it actually meant anything."
    -   In the story arc _Hard Time_, John is incarcerated in an _Oz_\-like prison in the Deep South where he is sexually menaced by a Scary Black Man named Traylor who has a penchant for making weaker inmates turn tricks. John later magically glamours a rioting mob of prisoners to see Traylor as a hot black woman, following which they violently gang-rape him, including smashing his teeth with a wrench for oral gratification (John's a '90s Anti-Hero; he doesn't have to be nice and Traylor was really pushing his luck).
-   _Kaijumax_ has Zonn pulling the closest kaiju equivalent to this trope by stabbing Electrogor in the head with an ovipositor and laying an egg inside it.
-   Combined with Marital Rape License (yes, that trope) in _Persepolis_: since it's illegal in fundamentalist Iran to execute virgins, and out of a belief that virgins can't go to hell, a female convict is quickly married off to a member of the Secret Police and raped by her 'husband' to take her virginity before being executed. Then, to hammer the point home, a pittance of a dowry is sent to her family. This happening to a person they knew, coupled with the fear that it could happen to Marjane, is one of _many_ reasons Marjane's parents send her to Austria.
-   The Punisher had a _Christmas Special_ backup where the perp he's chasing has vowed not to go back to prison due to his prior experiences there. Since the Punisher has promised not to kill on Christmas (that year), he drugs the guy and turns him over to the cops, saying "Learn to sleep with one eye open". The Punisher does this _while dressed as Santa Claus_, just to make it even more disturbing.
-   Happens to Wilson Fisk (years before he becomes The Kingpin) in _Punisher Max_. Five guys and 3 weeks in the prison infirmary. That said, it was back when he was just a small-time thug and it was one of the reasons behind his taking a level in bad-ass.
    -   Once Fisk gets out of jail, he finds the thug's wife and has her gang-raped by the filthiest hobos he can find, taking pictures all the while, which he sends to the thug. Thug goes nuts, kills a guard in his escape, and goes home to find Fisk waiting with a gun. Establishing Character Moment for Fisk. When Frank is in the same jail, one inmate named Big Jesus is riling up the others to attack Frank (they all chicken out) and eventually gets put in the cell next to him. Then he reveals he did all this to bust Frank out of prison so he'd kill Fisk (Fisk's rapist being Big Jesus' brother). It works and they escape... up until Frank shoots him.
    -   After O'Brien is sent to prison after the first storyarc (as punishment for helping Frank instead of following the mission of pressganging him into government black ops service), several of the other inmates are set on trying to make her a female version of this. O'Brien, being a former special forces operative, beats the hell out of them every time they try. The final time, one of them shivs her in the stomach and she ends up in the infirmary.
    -   In _The Cell_, after Frank is caught (on purpose, as it turns out), the corrupt guards parade him through the cell block and points out "Squeaky" Pete, an enormous Scary Black Man who's nickname refers to the fact that he enjoys raping his cellmates to death, and that they're going to turn a blind eye while he does the same to Frank. The guard informs Frank that Pete is the toughest guy in the prison. Frank promptly breaks free, bashes Pete's head in without breaking a sweat, then tells them to send the second toughest guy they have after him.
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   In _The Spectacular Spider Man_ #153, When Joe "Robbie" Robertson gets jailed by the machinations of Tombstone, the hulking inmate Bruiser decides that Robbie will become his "very close friend". In an immediate backpedal/Author's Saving Throw, it's quickly revealed/retconned that Bruiser has only platonic friendship in mind since Robbie reminds him of his brother, along with hasty denials in the letter column. But that's not what was _very_ clearly implied in the original scene.
    -   During the "Missing in Action" arc in _Web of Spider-Man_ #18, Peter is thrown in prison for vagrancy and stealing a blueberry pie. Some cellmates try to make a move on him, but he crushes an iron bar from the beds and they backpedal really fast.
    -   Spidey villain, third rank villain mind, Tombstone was being pestered by Kangaroo in prison. Tombstone set it up so that Kangaroo got stuck in a wall chasing him. Then three big burly inmates show up, and... yeah.
    -   When Black Cat was finally arrested and sent to prison, it was not-too-subtly implied the other inmates had a "thing" for her.
-   In _Starman_, during the space quest arc, the characters are sent to a space prison, one huge alien starts taking an interest in Jack. Jack rhetorically asks what the big guy's deal is, and when Mikaal starts to answer, interrupts him with "Yeah, I've seen _Oz_."

    Comic Strips 

-   Strongly implied in one _Between the Lines (2011)_ strip showing a tooth looking at another one who just dropped his toothpaste in a prison shower.
-   Played with in _Bloom County_, where Opus the penguin is sent to jail for a misinterpreted compliment, with one or more massive hungry prisoners regarding him with adoration...
-   In a _Dilbert_ story arc, Dogbert is picked up by the dog catcher and sent to the pound. In the dog pound, he shares a cell with a camp-looking poodle and is seen with a worried look on his face.
    
    **Dogbert:** So what did you do to get sent here, buddy?  
    **Poodle:** Nothing. My owner sent me here. He just didn't think a pit bull should dress like this.
    
-   Almost happens to Dale Arden on one occasion in the old _Flash Gordon_ comics, only the attempt is by a prison official rather than a fellow prisoner. While in Mingo City incognito, she and Zarkov get caught up in a mass arrest by Ming's secret police who are searching for Flash, and while they are locked up in the prison, Dale is spotted in her cell by its evil overlord Hong, who then arranges for her to be taken to his office for "questioning". Fortunately Flash, who has staged a prison break-in with a band of rebels, comes to her rescue in the nick of time and disposes of the despicable warden with his fists.

    Fan Works 

-   In _All You Need Is Love_, it is frequently implied that L did this to Light during his incarceration.
-   In _Alternate History_, Zhao likes "interrogating" female captives. Sokka uses this to his advantage when he brings Yue and her sister Katara to him as a distraction. Unfortunately, Zhao was talking to Zuko at the time and Zuko recognizes Katara as a free woman he saw a few days prior.
-   At _Alvan an the Chipmunks 3: The Second Squeakuel_, villain Ian Hawk (who raped and tortured one of the Chipettes earlier in the story) ends up in prison and meets his cellmate: Big Bubba, who asks him if he wants to be "the husband or the wife". Ian ends up spending the rest of his life as "Big Bubba's Bitch"... until _Modurn Warfare 3 The Dead Rise_, where Big Bubba decapitates and eats him after a Zombie Apocalypse.
-   Done repeatedly to the bully Todd Iainuzzi in the _Beavis and Butt-Head_ fanfiction "Deep Metal" after he gets on the bad side of Harry Sachz, who's a very big man with a very short fuse.
-   _Chrysanthemums_: Cilan and his two brothers are beaten and raped by guards while awaiting their executions. The guards do not get away with it. For their crimes, _they're_ also publicly executed in front of the triplets.
-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_:
    -   Nappa claims that this happened to Vegeta.
        
        **Nappa:** I'm Nappa. And this is Vegeta. He was a prison—  
        **Vegeta:** Shut the hell up, Nappa!  
        **Nappa:** ...BITCH.  
        **Vegeta:** Goddamn it, Nappa!
        
    -   Which is referring to the incident on Planet Arlia. Vegeta and Nappa were thrown into prison, and one of their fellow inmates started talking about how he was going to "violate Vegeta and sell him for a cigarette". Vegeta would have none of that. Unfortunately, Nappa introduced Vegeta as a "Prison Bitch" twice simply ''because'' they were in prison, as short as it was.
-   _Fairy Without Wings_: It is mentioned once or twice every two or three story arcs.
    -   Just as the Oracion Seis and Jellal are about to be taken to prison, Cobra warns Jellal he should not drop the soap.
    -   When Hibiki is taken away for an unspecified purpose (to him), his friend Eve tells him to not drop the soap. Jenny luckily notices it isn't what they think.
    -   Audrey Belladonna apparently sold her cellmate for cigarettes, which causes the annoyed warden to tell a guard to find the cellmate following the raping sounds.
-   _Farewell to Life the Way We Knew It_: Subverted. After being jailed, some of the guards try to take Jetta to another room, but her friend Roxy beats them up.
-   _Final Fantasy VII: Machinabridged_ had Tifa threaten Cloud into remaining onboard with AVALANCHE with the implication that if he doesn't (remember: he helped blow up Mako Reactor No.1), he'll be hauled off to jail and cohabilitate with "four dudes". Cloud rips into Tifa over it eight episodes later.
-   In _Jak II_, it's assumed that Erol raped Jak during the two year Time Skip in the opening cutscene to the point of being Fanon. Presumably to top off two years of torture and experimentation made explicit in the video game itself.
-   The _Invader Zim_ fanfic _The Karma Circle: Hard Time_ plays this for a bit of Black Comedy near the end. After Gaz is sent to space prison for assaulting an alien ambassador, in a letter to Dib she mentions how most of the alien women she has to share a shower with have tentacles, so she admits that there's a high chance that she'll end up dropping the soap and getting violated (but that this is still better than having to apologize for what she did).
-   Many fans of _Kiss Kiss Bang Bang_ assume main character Harry Lockhart was raped in prison. In-fic, it is sometimes this that keeps Harry/Perry from happening.
-   Subverted in _Mega Man Dies at the End_, when Dr. Wily begs not to be taken back to prison because of the things that go on in the showers... namely, the soap there dehydrates his skin. Double Subversion when he mentions being raped immediately afterwards.
-   _The Night Unfurls_: A rare instance where the victims are female, whereas the men-on-men variant has yet to be shown.
    -   Happens to the dark-elf prisoners in the Black Fortress, after the Black Dogs take over. It's not just the mercenaries though — the orcs in the fortress are also shown "helping themselves" with the captives. In the remastered version, this revelation is what causes four of the Black Dogs to defect.
    -   Also happens to the nuns in Chapter 7, who were taken hostage by the Black Dogs beforehand. After Feoh is surrendered, they are thrown into the dungeons to be ravished by red imps. By the time of their rescue, two have already succumbed, having long bled to death.
-   _Nobody Dies_ gives Iruel, the Computer Virus Angel, much more screen time and is Promoted to Complete Monster. Instead of being deleted, he gets locked into Magi-00, which is where the Ree live. More specifically, he's locked into a computer program. The name of said program? "Prison Shower." All of the fans on the message board agreed that it was fitting.
    -   _Hee~eey._
-   _None Piece_: Luffy can't go back to prison, his butthole can't take that kind of abuse!
-   John Gage is framed for drug smuggling while in Mexico and jailed in the _Emergency!_ fic "The Prisoner'', and gets this more than he cares to remember.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_ fanfic _Prison Island Break_ takes place almost entirely in a prison. Sexual assault and rape happens to lots of characters. It is written graphically and dramatically.
-   The last few chapters of _The Queen of Hearts_ reveal that, 20 years ago, Elsa and Anna's mother Queen Matilda was imprisoned during a war with the Southern Isles. She was tortured and raped by the king, which resulted in Hans.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   Common in the output of the _Star Trek (2009)_ Kink Meme. Sometimes played for kink, sometimes played for serious drama. There's a handful that have it happening to resident Cutie Chekov, generally by Nero and company.
    -   Also happens a lot in _Star Trek: Voyager_ fanfics featuring Tom Paris, usually related to his incarceration before the start of the series.
        -   A few fics of this type have also been written — with either Paris or Harry Kim as the victim — in reference to the Season 3 episode "The Chute", in which Paris and Kim are held in an alien Hellhole Prison after being falsely accused of a crime they didn't commit.
-   The _Kung Fu Panda_ fanfic _That's Why They Call It the Present_ has this happen off-screen to Tai Lung while he was in Chor-Gom. Considering Vachir was voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan, with all that implies, it was a rather unfortunate development. The fact this implies homosexuality on the part of the rapists, and that it isn't clear which part (the act, or their orientation) is being disapproved of by the other characters, mars an otherwise excellent story. The author later clarified her disapproval of _rape_, not homosexuality. (As well she might, since she is also the author of quite a few Slash Fics.)
    -   This is in fact something of a Fandom-Specific Plot when it comes to Tai Lung's time in prison, whether as a means of eliciting sympathy for the victim or a form of Laser-Guided Karma.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  One of the few fics to explicitly go out of its way to avert this, _A Different Lesson_, still uses every other form of Cold-Blooded Torture imaginable. It can be done well, with both this fic and "Present" handling the topic and the general Prison tropes sensitively, realistically, and with the proper gravitas and respect, but the prevalence of them in _Kung Fu Panda_ stories is...rather uncomfortable.
-   According to Amoridere and as stated in _The Warden's Lover_ (an NSFW sidestory from her perspective), Yukari had endured this at the warden's hands, during the events of Gensokyo 20XXII.
-   _With Pearl and Ruby Glowing_:
-   Referenced in _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_, at the end of the commentary special with Kaiba and Joey.
    
    **Kaiba:** That's it — get off my property, mutt!  
    **Joey:** Or what — you're gonna sic your Blue-Eyes White Dragon on me? "Oh, no, a big scary holographic monster's gonna eat me! Oh, whatever will I do?"  
    **Kaiba:** No, I'll just have you arrested. And you know what happens to cute blonds in the Big House...
    
-   Many _Beavis And Butthead_ fans hate the character of Todd, a thug who constantly beats up the protagonists and is a Karma Houdini despite being a violent criminal. The fanfic Coming Of Age gives Todd some long-overdue punishment by having him repeatedly beaten and sodomized by Harry Sachz, a huge, fat biker with a Hair-Trigger Temper that Todd mouths off to when they're both in the same police wagon. The fic's epilogue features Todd becoming Harry's cellmate, with Harry forcing him to wear a dirty wedding dress to show that he's Harry's "prison wife."
-   Archive of Our Own author 'Person\_Who\_Exists' specializes in this trope. Often times the girl a certain story centers on is also raped _when she's arrested, usually for something she didn't even do_, most of them often ending up pregnant before she even enters the main prison.

    Films — Animation 

-   Subtly referenced in _Puss in Boots_.
    
    **Humpty Alexander Dumpty:** You got any idea what they do to eggs in prison? I'll tell you this. It ain't over easy.
    
    -   However, later, we learn that Humpty just shared a cell with an old man chained to the wall, thus this line could be just an effort to further guilt-manipulate Puss.
-   Referenced in _Toy Story 3_, when Hamm and Rex come up with a distraction for Evil Buzz.
    
    **Hamm:** Hey! What do you think you're doing? I told you, keep your hands off of my stuff!  
    **Rex:** Make a move, porky!
    

    Films — Live-Action

-   In the "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue of National Lampoon's _Animal House_, it says that Greg Marmalard became a Nixon White House aide and was "raped in prison in 1974".
-   In _The Art of the Steal_, Agent Bick attempts to spook Francie with threats of this happening to him if he gets busted:
    
    **Francie Tobin:** Interpol? Fucking Interpol? I'm not going to fucking prison! I'm not cut out for that shit. Have you seen these fucking arms, man? These wet noodles will prevent very few prison rapes.
    
-   Referenced in _Backstreet Dreams_, with Manny refusing to risk arrest for fear of becoming someone's "little girl."
-   _Batman & Robin_ ends with Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze sharing the same cell. With Ivy having betrayed Freeze and attempting to kill his wife, Freeze vows to make Ivy suffer for the rest of their sentence with enough lecherousness in his tone to provide some Unfortunate Implications.
-   _Beyond the Walls_: It turns out that Doron had a note, which he kept clutched in his fist as he was being strangled to death, and which whoever killed him didn't see. As Uri reveals to the prisoners, Doron wrote that he had been asked by Herskovitz to lie and say that he heard the Arabs plotting the murder of Hoffman.
-   The hero learns Kung Fu from a scary old mentor deliberately to avoid this in _Big Stan_.
-   Controversial scene (cut from many broadcasts) in _Born Innocent_ (1974), when three inmates ambush Linda Blair in the showers and give her the business with a plunger handle.
-   Almost happens to Moses (Adam Sandler) in _Bulletproof_ while placed in a holding cell with a large punk who takes an uncomfortable interest in him (with Sandler pleading while struggling, "Hey, man, don't do what I think you're gonna do, 'cause neither of us is gonna enjoy it."). Fortunately for Moses, he is whisked away by a cop with a deal, which he accepts.
-   _The Butterfly Effect_ features a brutal prison rape scene involving Ashton Kutcher's character and the Aryan Brotherhood. He gives them a Groin Attack, as it was a ploy to get back a diary that he needed to continue his time travels.
-   _Cyberjack_: Mentioned as a throwaway line by Nassim when he's trying to figure out Nick's identity.
    
    **Nassim:** Nick James... Nick... Nick... I used to fuck a guy in prison called Nick. No wait, that was Nick Jones.
    
-   _The Dark Knight Rises_:
    -   A female example - one of the reasons Talia Al-Ghul became so messed up was because she saw her mother captured and raped to death by a group of prisoners who escaped their cells, began a riot, and broke into Talia and her mother's own cell.
    -   Also implied to be the reason a police officer is initially worried about keeping Selina Kyle in the men's prison. It's subverted when she's shown breaking the hand of a prisoner making lewd comments at her, which is used by another officer to indicate that she can handle herself just fine.
-   _Death Warrant_: When Burke first enters his own cell, his bunk mate threatens to rape him. The muscular Burke, unimpressed, quickly shows him who's boss by beating him up. They become buddies afterwards.

-   This actually happens to Norm MacDonald's character (the main character) in _Dirty Work_. After a short scene of him discussing what happens to guys in prison with his friend, they show him walk from off-screen, buttoning his pants, and talking about how disgusting and rude his fellow inmates are.
    
    **Mitch**: You fellas have a lot of growing up to do, I'll tell you that. Ridiculous. Completely ridiculous. Can you believe these characters? Way out of line. Way out of line. Have a good mind to go to the warden about this. You know what hurts the most is the... the lack of respect. You know? That's what hurts the most. Except for the... Except for the other thing. That hurts the most. But the lack of respect hurts the second most.
    
-   _The Escapist_: Threatened at, and later carried out on, Lacey, leading to him attempting suicide.
-   _The Experiment_. But come on, you could tell.
-   The Steven Seagal movie _Fire Down Below_ ends with Seagal disabling the main bad guy with one shot instead of killing him because he wants the bad guy to meet the "new friend" who is going to share his cell in prison. Given Seagal's general description of the "new friend" in question, one can make a pretty good guess about what's in store for the villain once he arrives...
-   _Fear Clinic_: Dialogue reveals that Those Two Guys Bauer and Gage were on the receiving end of the trope in the past.
-   In a Black Comedy Rape example, one of the _Fletch_ movies sees the title character in a prison cell with a big guy who curtly says "bend over" when Fletch asks his name.
-   In _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_, while incarcerated at the Kyln, Peter Quill is molested by a large blue inmate who gloats about what he plans to do to the "new meat". Groot and Rocket quickly step in to place Quill under their protection by publicly and painfully taking out his would-be rapist.
-   Frequently referenced in _Half Baked_; the main characters need to raise money to bail their friend out of jail, because his "butthole is in constant jeopardy".
-   Seagal pretty much says the same thing in _Hard to Kill_. But then no one ever accused Steven Seagal movies of an overabundance of originality.
-   Strangely absent from _I Love You Phillip Morris_. While it is vaguely referenced as something that happens to "blond-haired, blue-eyed queers in the yard", sexual acts seem to be largely consensual in the prison. Giving someone a blowjob in exchange for favors seems to be "your choice", and the only sex that is shown is between Steven and Phillip, who are very obviously gay and in love.
-   In the 2003 movie _In Hell_, minor character Billy gets subjected to this every night as soon as he arrives at the prison. It's definitely NOT played for laughs, and in fact the first time it happens it's pure Nightmare Fuel.
-   In _An Innocent Man_, James Rainwood tolerates regular bullying and beatings from Jingles, only to finally stab him to death in a bathroom stall when Jingles threatened to rape him.
-   The following exchange from _Inside Man_:
    
    **Dalton Russell**: A week from now I'll be sucking on pina coladas in a hot tub with six girls named Jennifer and Tina.  
    **Det. Keith Frazier**: A week from now you're going to be in a prison shower with two guys named Jack and Jose, and that thing you're sucking on? It's not a pina colada.
    
-   Referenced in _Iron Man 2_, when Tony Stark visits Ivan Vanko in his holding cell.
    
    **Ivan:** The truth: all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you.  
    **Tony:** Where are you gonna be watching the world consume me _from_? Oh, right, a prison cell. I'll send you a bar of soap.
    
-   The plot of _Jailbait_ (not to be confused with the Ed Wood film or the 2014 film starring Sara Malakul Lane) centers on another Michael Pitt character, Randy, getting raped in prison by his cellmate.
-   _Jailbait (2014)_: Anna suffers this from other inmates. It's portrayed as endemic to the prison, including by the warden, who coerces many inmates into sex in return for favors.
-   _Johnny Be Good_: When Johnny and Leo get arrested, Hisler talks about how they’re going to get raped.
-   Played for Drama in _Juice_, as Bishop's father underwent this in prison with the trauma turning him into a catatonic Empty Shell. If that wasn't bad enough, he becomes a laughingstock on the streets with Bishop getting picked on by association, fueling his Start of Darkness.
-   The ending of _Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects_, where Duke, the main bad guy of the movie, is Hoist by His Own Petard following his imprisonment for his sexual crimes against children.
    
    **Crowe:** Now that's justice.
    
-   Subverted in _Let's Go to Prison_, where Scary Black Man Barry attempts to woo Nelson, the protagonist and his love interest, with toilet-made Merlot and a romantic environment in his cell. Nelson originally submits to being Barry’s “lover” out of fear, but after Nelson has to save Barry from being attacked by a Nazi gang, they become close friends. Having grown genuinely fond of Barry, Nelson plays along with the “relationship” at his own will.
-   _The Long Kiss Goodnight_. Samuel L. Jackson, while Impersonating an Officer for a badger game, has this epic line when the mark tries giving him lip.
    
    **Mitch:** I will see to it you spend the next ten years in prison getting assfucked, and if the case is thrown out because my arrest was too violent, I will personally hire a man to assfuck you for the next ten years, so if you're an assfucking fan, you go ahead and mouth off.
    
-   This happens to the titular character of _Mad Dog Morgan_ during his first incarceration for robbery. While Morgan had initially turned to robbery out of desperation, this is his true Start of Darkness, and when he gets out of prison he no longer has anything to lose, and takes back to bushranging with a vengeance.
-   The "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue in _Mallrats_ has the Jerk Jock, who liked to "screw girls in a very uncomfortable place", have the same thing happen to him. But he didn't get sent to the back of a Volkswagen.
-   This is the most memorable plot point in the 1978 movie _Midnight Express_, which is about an American who tries to smuggle drugs out of Turkey and winds up in a truly brutal prison. The horrors of American "kids" being brutalized in foreign prisons in various ways became a common trope in news stories for decades after this movie came out. Ironically, _American_ prisons have developed such a reputation for brutality over the years that foreign travelers are warned about _them_. And so the circle of life continues.
-   In _Minority Report_, Anderton entrusts the surgery for his eyes (to avoid detection) to a back alley surgeon. Just before going under anesthesia, the surgeon reveals that Anderton had put him in prison. He mentions spending time in the library to avoid this trope, but couldn't avoid the showers forever.
-   One of many reasons why Richard and Justin (particularly Justin) don't want to get caught in _Murder by Numbers (2002)_. Particularly disturbing when the Cruel Twist Ending _does_ implicitly result in Justin going to prison, _alone_ and without his more domineering best friend there for support. Fridge Logic renders this even more unpleasant, as Justin's actor is the baby-faced and somewhat short Michael Pitt.
-   _Murphys Law_ (1986). Charles Bronson starts a fight with the female car thief he's handcuffed to by implying she'll enjoy her upcoming prison sentence. "The first time, the dykes will have to hold you down, but soon you'll get to like it."
-   Referenced in _My Cousin Vinny_, in the scene where the wrongfully accused first meet their new lawyer in prison. Stan, who has never seen Vinny before, mistakes him for an inmate who wants to sexually harass him, which is not helped by Vinny's unfortunate choice of words.
    
    **Vinny:** What's wrong with you?
    
    **Stan:** I don't wanna do this!
    
    **Vinny:** I understand, but, you know, what are your alternatives?
    
    **Stan:** My alternatives? To what, to you? I don't know, suicide, death?
    
    **Vinny:** Look, it's either me or them. You're getting fucked one way or the other.
    
-   Used way too hilariously in the third _The Naked Gun_ movie. Drebin has infiltrated a prison, and a big scary prisoner throws a bar of soap in the shower and tells him to pick it up. Drebin does... but not before he's had metal underpants appear seemingly from nowhere.
-   _The New Guy_ has Luther explain to Dizzy the parallels between prison and high school. "Bad food; high fences; the sex you want, you ain't getting; the sex you're getting, you don't want."
-   _Office Space_ famously used this as the protagonists' primary motivation to hide their crime. To clarify, the place they'd rather stay out of is "federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison".
    
    "Hey Peter man, watch your cornhole in there!"
    
-   In _Puff Puff Pass_, one of the protagonists keeps being shocked that everyone else but him takes it for granted that Andy Dufresne was raped off-screen in _The Shawshank Redemption_. (Granted, in the original novella, he was.)
-   The Made-for-TV Movie _The Rape of Richard Beck_ about the eponymous police officer who doesn't have a whole lot of sympathy for female rape victims until an escaped prisoner who overpowers him does something, and, well, you can guess what happens from the title of the movie. A bit of Black Comedy occurs when a rape counselor comes to see him, who, of course, is a woman...
-   This happens to Jimmy in _Reefer Madness: The Musical_ when he is sent to prison for killing Mary. Like everything else in the movie, this is Played for Laughs and blamed on marijuana.
-   Referenced in _Reservoir Dogs_, when Nice Guy Eddie described a white inmate, who upon being released from prison, was talking like a black man (though Tarantino being Tarantino, "black man" wasn't the term Eddie used) because "all that black semen been shooting up his butt, backed up into his brain and coming out of his mouth."
-   The Dragon in _Road House (1989)_ taunts Dalton during their big fight by revealing to him that "I used to fuck guys like you in prison!" Then Dalton rips his throat out.
-   _RoboCop (1987)_: The villain Emil expresses his relief that nobody "popped" his "cherry" while he was in prison for a brief time.
-   In _The Rock_, Sean Connery's character jokes that fighting the rogue soldier on Alcatraz is better than his regular day "reading philosophy and avoiding gang rape in the washroom." Though this is apparently less of a problem, in recent times. "I musht be looshing my shex appeal."
-   In _Rock N Rolla_, Handsome Bob has just confessed his romantic feelings towards One Two on the eve of a possible five years in prison.
    
    **Handsome Bob:** It's fine, it's fine. Five years, you know, I don't know if I can handle it.  
    **One Two:** I don't know what I was thinking, Bob. I mean, there's nothing wrong with being a poof or being a gay, or whatever it is you call it, I don't know. I mean, there's gonna be plenty of your lot in there. You'll probably love it.
    
-   _Ruthless People_. Barbara taunts captor Ken with it.
    
    **Barbara:** _\[whistles\]_ Nice butt. That's what they'll say.  
    **Ken:** I beg your pardon?  
    **Barbara:** Nice butt. That's what they'll say on your first day, in the men's club.  
    **Ken:** The men's club?  
    **Barbara:** Mmm. The San Quentin Country Club. With a cute little rear end like that, you'll be the belle of the ball. Your dance card'll be filled every day. You'll be so popular, making all kinds of new, close friends. Big, _ugly, **hairy friends**_! Not that you'll ever see what they look like, 'cause you'll be facing the other way.  
    **Ken:** You're very good at this. You should write children's books.
    
-   The 1978 documentary _Scared Straight!_ shows some youth offenders being talked to by long-term prisoners telling them how bad prison is, trying to scare them straight. One of the topics is prison rape.
-   _Scary Movie_: When Cindy apologizes to Bobby in the school cafeteria for getting him locked up overnight because she believed him to be the killer, a big burly prisoner walks into frame and thanks Bobby for the "company".
-   Happens in _Scum_, which takes place in a borstal. The greenhouse rape scene is horrific.
-   _The Shawshank Redemption_: At one point, the warden threatens to throw Andy in with the "perverts and the sodomites". Andy is actually a victim of prison rape earlier on, before the warden found his use for the former accountant for dubious accounting purposes and put him with a tamer population (along with his chief rapist being brutally beaten to warn off the rest).
-   _Shot Caller_: On his first night in prison, Jacob is witness to the gang rape of another inmate.
-   Referenced and subverted in _The Siege_. When FBI Agent Hubbard (played by Denzel Washington) arrests the female CIA Agent Kraft (Annette Benning), he half-jokingly/half-seriously threatens to send her to the infamous New York prison on Rikers Island if she doesn't co-operate with him, and asks if Kraft knows what some of the other women in there will do to her. Kraft responds by pretending to be Too Kinky to Torture, as she just licks her lips and goes "Mmm... yum." That pretty effectively disarms Hubbard's threat and leaves him at a bit of a loss as to how to respond.
-   _Sleepers_: The entire movie is hinged on this, made even more terrible by the fact that the brutalized parties are underage boys and the perpetrators are guards. At juvenile prison (apparently Truth in Television — see the bottom of the page).
-   In _Son of a Gun_, Dave is initially sexually abusing JR's cellmate. After the cellmate attempts suicide and winds up in the hospital, Dave switches his attention to JR. Dave and his gang drag JR into a bathroom and are about to rape him when Lynch, Sterlo and Merv show up and haul them off.
-   Implied in _Strange Brew_:
    
    **Doug:** Those big cons are gonna love you, eh?  
    **Bob:** What do you mean?  
    **Doug:** You're a cute little guy. They're gonna be lovin' you from dawn until dusk, eh?  
    **Bob:** Where are you gonna be?  
    **Doug:** I'll be in the cafeteria, selling smokes.
    
-   Female example in _Sympathy for Lady Vengeance_. While Geum-ja is in prison, she interacts with a woman known as "the Witch" who forces other inmates to have sex with her. The rape scene is very much played for drama, and Geum-ja secretly poisons the Witch to avenge her victims.
-   In _The Ten_, the story for "thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife" is a Black Comedy Rape take on this.
    
    "I can't look at you without fantasizing about shoving you up against a wall in the laundry room, and punching you in the mouth... And then raping you. Without your consent, of course." "That's what makes it rape, right?" "That's what makes it rape."
    
-   A little Joey Lawrence movie called _Tequila Body Shots_ gives this as the consequence of landing in Mexican prison. Fortunately, or unfortunately if you prefer, Joey Lawrence does not end up in Mexican prison. Joey's love interest's psycho ex-boyfriend, however...
-   In _There's Something About Mary_, Ted (Ben Stiller) was falsely accused of murder (which was actually done by an escaped mental patient). Before he was released, we see a large inmate lying next to Ted in bed, which implied that he was _about_ to be raped when the policemen interrupted.
-   In the wild-west Zombie Apocalypse film _Undead or Alive_, prison rape is threatened by Cletus when he informs Luke and Cletus that they're going to be horse-whipped after being arrested by Sheriff Claypool.
    
    **Cletus:** They'll leave you hangin' on the rail. You ain't even gonna know who it is comin' up behind you to take a dig at your dirt-mine. But don't worry, when it's my turn I'll be sure to whisper somethin' real sweet...  
    **Elmer:** (_sighing_) This day is turning out terrible!
    
-   Played for laughs in _Walking Tall (2004)_, as Chris and Ray joke that this is the villain's probable fate.
    
    **Ray:** I bet he's blowing on somebody's dice right now.
    

    Jokes 

-   Implied in this Scare 'Em Straight joke against drug abuse: Two psychologists are running a bet who can keep more juvenile drug offenders out of trouble. So, P#1 is having them dudes for a stern talk, and success, 10% less repeated offenders who were in his program. P#2: "So how did you do it?" "Well, I simply drew two circles, one big, one small, and pointed to the big circle: 'This is your brain BEFORE you took drugs...'" "Meh. Can do better." And P#2 is giving them \*his\* talk. Whoa! 90% stay clean forever! P#1 is dumbfounded. "How did \*you\* do it?" "Well, I simply drew two circles, one big, one small, and pointed to the small circle: 'This is your asshole BEFORE you went to prison...'"
-   A woman is in a prison shower, when a massive Butch Lesbian comes up to her and asks "With or without spit?" The woman figures that whatever is about to happen to her, it'll hurt less with a lubricant, says "with." The other woman then yells across the shower "Hey, Spit! This girl wants a threesome!"

    Literature 

-   Played for Laughs in _Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason_, where Bridget is imprisoned in Thailand for unwittingly smuggling drugs and is groped/molested by other women in her cell. She ends up having to bribe them to leave her alone by giving them her Wonderbra, but consoles herself by thinking she is safe because at least she still has underpants.
-   Used by Mercedes Lackey in one of her _Burning Wheels_ titles, where the stepfather had spent years abusing his stepdaughter, giving her multiple personality syndrome as a defense mechanism. Once the elves caught him, he was placed in an extra-dimensional space, with something large which began using the same lines he'd used, just before the scene cut away.
-   It's unclear whether or not Angel ever did suffer prison rape in the _Charlie Parker Series_, but the threat of it at least almost drove him to suicide, and led to Parker (an NYPD detective at the time) arranging to have the prisoner threatening him killed.
-   One nearly happens in the _Classic Singapore Horror Stories_ short, _Jailbird_, where the newbie prisoner protagonist Robin Wong is approached by Warden Lau, and asked if he wants a "plastic bag". Robin was about to say yes, but then realize the other prisoners around him are silently shaking their heads; another prisoner suddenly instigates a fight that leaves the warden in critical condition. Later on Robin finds out the warden is a homosexual pervert and "plastic bag" is a slang term for _condoms_.
-   In the Archer Mayor novel _Chat_, the rape of Andy Griffis while he was in prison was part of what eventually drove him to suicide, and what's even worse is that he only wound up in jail because he was talked by his father into taking the fall for his scumbag older brother Dan for a robbery Dan committed, out of a belief that since Andy was the White Sheep of his family, they would go easy on him, only to wind up in front of a judge who threw the book at him. No one in the story treats the rape as anything less than a horrific act of violence.
-   _A Clockwork Orange_ has a few references to this — the teenage Villain Protagonist Alex makes offhand mentions to several cellmates in prison early on fighting over who gets to have him, which probably wouldn't have ended well. Later, Alex leads the fatal attack on a new sexually abusive cellmate.
-   An example with women is Played for Laughs in _A Confederacy of Dunces_. After Lana Lee is arrested on a charge of distributing pornography, she ends up sharing a cell with Betty, Frieda, and Liz — arrested for assault. It's heavily implied that, being pretty good-looking, Lana doesn't last very long before the three lesbians go after her.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   A rather dark joke (of the "blink and you'll miss it" variety) in _The Fifth Elephant_, as Vimes tries to talk Lady Sybil out of making him wear a formal "duke outfit" that includes red tights to an important function: "Duke's a military title, dear. No soldier would ever wear tights to a battlefield. Not if he thought there was any chance of him being taken prisoner, anyway."
    -   Not at all played for humour in _Snuff_, when Vimes tells a character he'd much rather be in the police cells than the Tanty, because if he goes down on his knees, it'll only be to pray.
-   _Help I Am Being Held Prisoner_: Harry is warned to steer clear of a group called "The Joy Boys" for this reason, at least until he has Phil's gang as protectors.
-   Liam in the first _The Fey and the Fallen_ book is brutally beaten and raped by a warden during his first prison stint, something Played for Horror that causes him immense mental and emotional anguish for the rest of the series.
-   A particularly nasty version of prison rape plays a significant part in the brilliant and repulsive short story "I Am Infinite, I Contain Multitudes", by Douglas Clegg.
-   Another example with women: in Sidney Sheldon's _If Tomorrow Comes_, Tracy Whitney gets gang-raped by her three cellmates the first night and loses her baby as a result.
-   The _Illuminatus!_ trilogy. The appearance of Harry Coin is greeted with "It's safe to assume that anyone you meet in prison is a homosexual" and sure enough, Harry wants to bugger his new cellmate before they've even been introduced. Of course, like much of the books, this whole scene is subverted, double-subverted, and triple-subverted not long after.
-   In the first _Jack Reacher_ novel, Reacher winds up in the worst part of a prison along with a yuppie named Hubble. This trope was subverted when Reacher nearly kills the leader of a gang in his cell, as well as several Aryans in the showers.
-   The Danielle Steel novel _Malice_ nearly plays out a female version of this. The protagonist is in jail for having murdered her sexually abusive father (nobody believed her, thanks to his pillar of the community standing). A group of violent prisoners take her from her cell and are very close to assaulting her when she's rescued by her cellmate.
-   _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_: Not exactly prison, but the orderlies at the Pendleton insane asylum love to give patients showers. They always check the patient's temperature at the same time they shower the patient, and they go down to Miss Ratched beforehand to get a rectal thermometer and a bottle of Vaseline. She admonishes them to use the minimum amount of Vaseline necessary, but they take the whole bottle inside with them, and they turn up the water pressure till the noise makes it impossible to hear anything that's going on inside...
-   The most horrifying instance of rape in the _Outlander_ series (occurring in the first book, nonetheless, set in the mid-18th century) takes place in prison but is not precisely prison rape, more of a version of the Scarpia Ultimatum where both parties are male. Claire, the female love interest (from the 1940s — it's a long story) is... about as disturbed as one would expect, as the rape comes at the hands of a particularly sadistic villain. The same villain is implied to have been doing so for some time now to his other captives, at least one of whom commits suicide after.
    -   Oh yeah, and said villain is distantly related to — and looks exactly like — Clare's first husband.
-   In _Patriot Games_, Sean Miller is nearly gang raped by several other inmates, only to be rescued by a cop assigned to keep an eye on him. Miller repays the cop by shooting him in the stomach so he will die slowly and agonizingly.
-   _The Pope of Greenwich Village_; Faced with prison, the character Paulie complains "I ain't a big, tough guy. I go to jail and some big, militant nigger's gonna grab me in the showers and stuff it up my ass." (Paulie's choice of words, not ours!)
-   In the earlier chapters of _A Prisoner Of Birth_, set in, well, prison, gang rape is referenced as the usual fate for gay prisoners... usually followed by being ripped limb from limb. One gay character we meet is only spared from this because good barbers are difficult to come by. And one of the guys the main character gets his revenge on for falsely incriminating him — a slightly Camp Gay soap opera actor — implicitly has prison rape to look forward to as part of his karmic comeuppance.
-   A standard element to make horror stories more horrific yet. In Stephen King's novella _Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption_, the narrator muses over the topic of prison gangrape, admitting that it had happened to him, observing that it happens to the story's protagonist Andy Dufresne, and making it sound like it happens to nearly everyone in Shawshank prison. Dufresne in particular is targeted by a group of rapists called "the sisters" who repeatedly assault him in the early years of his incarceration.
-   Discussed in King's _The Stand_ as to the reason why Trash Can Man's mother and stepfather (the sheriff) couldn't send him to juvenile hall for his arson activities without leaving with a "size eleven asshole".
-   In the Dale Brown novel _Storming Heaven_, the male terrorist villain Henri Cazaux was arrested by U.S. soldiers on a base in Belgium as a teenager and repeatedly raped by them over two days. Needless to say, this provides him with plenty of motivation to hate the United States and also decide he will never be caught alive.
-   A Joseph Wambaugh short story had a cop constantly worrying that his crazy partner's "unorthodox" style of law enforcement would get them both sent to prison, where he, the sane one, was certain he'd be repeatedly raped. His anxiety about this, and his over-the-top references to how stretched-out he expected his anus to get, were played for laughs.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _227_ of all shows hints at this after Mary causes a ruckus at the Social Security office after Pearl is denied her check. They, along with Rose and Sandra, are arrested, and although Sandra is initially flattered when another prisoner compliments her style, she absolutely panics when the woman follows it up by saying "When we get to the big house, Big Bertha's gonna _love_ you."
-   _Arrested Development_:
    -   In the third season George Bluth complains about being under house arrest with his wife (after having spent most of the first two seasons incarcerated):
        
        "In prison I just had to lie there and take it. Here, I have to lie there and _give_ it."
        
    -   In the same episode, George gives a speech to troubled youth about life in prison in order to scare them straight (i.e. off of drugs or gangs or whatever), but ends up describing prison rape to a group of gay youth who are expecting to be scared straight (i.e. into becoming heterosexuals). Needless to say, they are excited by the prospect of sweaty groping in the dark by buff men.
    -   It's also made fun of when Lindsay visits her father in prison during a previous season and he's explaining why he wants her to stop coming:
        
        **George Sr.:** I'm paying thousands of dollars in Krugerrands.  
        **Lindsay:** What?  
        (Pause)  
        **George Sr.:** Gold Krugerrands. Your mother snuck them in here, stuffed them in energy bar wrappers to keep me from getting strangled in the shower or worse.  
        **Lindsay:** Stabbed?  
        **George Sr.:** In a way.
        
    -   In one first season episode, George Michael is revealed to have watched an episode of _Oz_ as a small child (having confused it for _The Wizard of Oz_), and is terrified of visiting his grandfather in prison as a result.
-   In _Arthur And George_, a fairly loose adaption of Julian Barnes' historical novel _Arthur And George_, there's a plotpoint of Arthur (Arthur Conan Doyle) witnessing the supposedly harmless and wrongfully convicted George Eldalji meeting with a (fictional) dangerous criminal who was the inspiration for Moriarty. When confronted, George discusses how he was subjected to sexual abuse by the guards in the form of what was called a "dry bath" (essentially a cavity search) and when he attempted to fight back, was thrown down a flight of stairs. The other inmate (the dangerous criminal) witnessed this and used his influence to get the guards to leave Edalji alone. Doyle questions with a raised eyebrow what the other inmate expected in return, and Edalji reveals that he started teaching the guy to read and has continued to do so now that both are out of prison.
-   Although not explicitly rape, _Bad Girls_ has a scene of decrotching where a new girl has drugs forcibly removed from aforementioned place by other inmates.
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_. The crew of Pegasus gang-rape their Cylon prisoner Gina, initially in an attempt to break her resistance to interrogation and later just because they like it. The same thing nearly happens (does happen, in the extended version) to Athena until Helo and Tyrol intervene.
-   Averted in _The Big Bang Theory_ when Sheldon Cooper - a character who might otherwise be thought to be vulnerable - is briefly imprisoned. Thrown into a holding cell, he is appraised by the other inmates in a way that he is oblivious to and which might not augur well if played for drama. Instead, Sheldon glares at the big, hard, tough looking con in the place nearest the door and says "You're in my spot". Figuring he's in the presence of a _real_ maniac psycho who is throwing down a challenge, the tough-looking con surrenders the spot. Sheldon is unmolested.
-   In the _Blake's 7_ episode "Space Fall", the new second in command of a prison ship is caught trying to intimidate Jenna, a female prisoner, into sex. He's told to "be discrete".
-   Prior to the start of the _Street Justice_ series, main character Grady spent several years in prison, where he had to fight off numerous attackers during his incarceration. It's how he developed his fighting ability which he later utilizes during the series' run.
    
    **Adam:** _\[having just seen Grady beat up some thugs\]_ That prison must've had some martial arts program.  
    **Grady:** Actually, the instructors weren't so hot, but they did know how to motivate a guy.  
    **Adam:** Yeah, like how?  
    **Grady:** Nightly showers.
    
-   _Boardwalk Empire_: Subverted in the 5th season. Gillian, now in an insane asylum, promises the very butch female ward (who is staring at her naked) "what she wants" in exchange for a favor. The ward gets her alone... then we find out that "what she wants" is actually some of Gillian's sexy dresses from before she was incarcerated.
-   _The Bold and the Beautiful_: While in a mental hospital for her various crimes, Sheila gets beaten up by two other prisoners. Their unpleasant appearance and demeanor, plus the way Sheila acts afterwards—taking a Shower of Angst—are clearly meant to imply that they sexually assaulted her as well. Even if not, the whole sequence still gives off a Does This Remind You of Anything? vibe.
-   In the third season of the French crime drama _Braquo_, Prosecutor Vanderbeck implies that he was subject to what he calls "these inconveniences", adding that he thought his old age should have protected him. He uses this as a bargaining chip with Roxanne: he's ready to give her information about Vogel's sister if she transfers him in a privileged district.
-   _Breaking Bad_:
    -   Walter White's lawyer Saul has a line about how a young man in prison will "get his rectum resized YAY big", with a hand signal for a cylindrical hole.
    -   When Walt at one point toys with the idea of having Jesse Pinkman arrested for some minor offence to get him off the streets Saul reacts with a hesitant: "I don't know, Pinkman in prison? I'm picturing it...", and Walt quickly amends he meant a juvenile detention center.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Mentioned in "I Only Have Eyes For You". Buffy is _pissed_ about a jock who murdered his girlfriend, and rather than forgiving him like she is told will lift the curse cites he deserves "sixty years of breaking rocks and making special friends with Roscoe the weightlifter."
    -   In "Earshot", Buffy was about to suggest this as Jonathan's fate if he were to commit mass murder.
    -   In "Who Are You", Faith-as-Buffy shocks Joyce by laughing over how "Faith" will be showered with affection by "big ole Bertha" in prison — she quickly backpedals, pretending to be upset over how Joyce was attacked. Ironically, Buffy has made similar comments in the past, though of course never in front of her mother.
    -   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chaos Bleeds_ has Faith mention that she had to ward off prison rape when she chose to pay her debt to society.
    -   Katrina's last words (apart from "get off me!") in "Dead Things" are "I'm gonna make sure you get locked up for this, then we'll see how _you_ like getting raped!".
    -   In "Villains", Jonathan and Andrew discuss the possibility of this happening to them. They're stuck between the proverbial rock and hard place, as the other option (before the Scoobies help them escape) involves Willow killing them.
    -   In the _Angel_ episode "Ground State", Team Angel have to break into a vault to steal a magical artifact and Fred comments, "We're still working on a plan, but so far, it involves being sent to prison and becoming somebody's bitch." Used as a Brick Joke when Fred later whimpers, "Please, let my cellmate be gentle."
-   An episode of _Cagney & Lacey_ has an 18 year old boy sent to Riker's Island penitentiary on a minor charge who ends up getting raped there. His parents sue the city.
-   The HBO drama _Capadocia_ is set in a women's prison in Mexico. It does not shy away from showing a rape or a rape attempt.
    -   Antonia begs to be transferred to a woman's prison because being a transwoman in the overcrowded men's prison has made her a target for this.
    -   Another inmate, Yolanda, terrorizes a young new inmate (the warden's daughter) and is about to rape her. Lorena stops Yolanda by nearly bludgeoning her to death.
-   _Criminal Minds_:
    -   Comes up once in a blue moon as an interrogation technique, most often delivered by Morgan who (due to his backstory) has no problem telling child molesters exactly what the general population does to their kind.
    -   Also joked about in an early episode:
        
        **Reid:** Is this legal?  
        **Garcia:** No. We'll both go to prison and you'll be somebody's bitch.  
        **Reid:** ...Really?
        
-   In one episode of _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ Nick tried to set a stoner kid straight by putting him a holding room with a lot of large, hardened criminals and noting how "popular" he'll be in prison. The criminals were more than happy to play along.
-   Averting this trope is subtly implied to be why Horatio (_CSI: Miami_) stopped off at a barbershop on his way to turn in a teenage prisoner, so the youth (who's his illegitimate son) can have his long hair shaved back to an un-girlish crewcut.
-   _ER_:
    -   In one episode a prisoner is brought into the hospital, having been injured in a fight. It soon becomes obvious, via the location of his injuries, that he was raped.
    -   Played for laughs in an episode where Carter is arrested. His Scary Black Man cellmate approaches him, undoing his pants, declaring, "I've got something for you" Carter screams in panic. . .and the guy reveals a sore on his leg that's been bothering him—Carter had mentioned that he was a doctor.
-   In the _Firefly_ episode "The Message", a corrupt Alliance cop by the name of Womack intimidates a post official, one of Mal's friends, into betraying him using graphic threats of prison rape.
    
    **Lt. Womack:** _You are an ugly-looking little quim, you know that? So you have to be asking yourself, ugly as you are, how repulsive-looking the guy that's gonna make you his little woman is gonna be. Hmm? I mean, prison is a lonely place. You sure as a hundred moons ain't gonna be pitching._
    
-   _Forever_: Jo basically threatens a suspect with this in "The Wolves of Deep Brooklyn" to get him to cooperate.
-   _Frasier_:
    -   In one episode, Niles declares that his bone structure is too fine for him to go to prison.
    -   In another, upon finding out that the boy who bullied him as a child ("He used to call me "Shorts In The Shower" boy!") is in prison, Niles smugly sips his coffee and queries, "Well, who's wearing shorts in the shower now?"
-   _Friends_:
    -   In one episode Phoebe quells an argument between Rachel and Monica by grabbing their ears and forcing them both to their knees. She then comments that if they were in prison, Monica and Rachel would be her bitches.
    -   Also referenced when a tailor molests Chandler, and Joey says that's how you're measured for trousers and Ross replies: "Yeah in _prison!_"
    -   Also implied when Phoebe thinks they're all going to end up in prison and wishes relatively effeminate Chandler, 'good luck', he looks freaked out, and you can see both Monica automatically moving closer to him and Joey reassuringly patting him on the shoulder.
-   In the third season of _Game of Thrones_, the head Bolton guard has Theon beaten after his escape attempt fails and prepares to sodomize him. Ramsay ends up shooting the head guard and his men so that he can continue his own interrogation of Theon.
-   _General Hospital_:
    -   Young Michael Corinthos reveals that he was raped when he was in prison temporarily. The show treated it very seriously in a similar manner to the way it previously handled the traumatic rape of female characters like Liz Webber. The storyline was lauded by several critics as powerful particularly since Michael was a legacy character the shows fans had watched grow up.
    -   Liz herself, when confronting her attacker, taunted him about going to prison, "and maybe then, _you'll_ learn something about rape."
-   _Ghost Adventures_: When the paranormal investigators learn that some of the Moundsville State Penitentiary inmates grabbed another inmate in the prison's shower and gang-raped him to death, the investigators send poor Aaron into the shower alone to be bait for the ghosts of the rapists. Not wanting to purposefully provoke the perpetrators, Aaron tries to get activity from the victim's ghost instead by offering his sympathies.
-   This is alluded to in _The Golden Girls_ (of all places). When Dorothy and Stan are threatened with legal action from the IRS (it was Stan's fault) and he is worried about going to prison, Dorothy angrily tells him. "I _want_ you to go to prison, Stan. And I hope a six-foot tall, bald convict named 'Bubba' chooses you as his girlfriend!" In another episode, after Miles reveal to Rose that he used to be an accountant for a mobster, he reveals that he turned state's evidence in order to avoid going to prison, and presumably, dealing with this trope.
-   Shown in the British series _The Governor_. Like _Oz_, it is realistically portrayed and very disturbing.
-   A very important plot point is Andrés' rape in prison in the Argentinian TV show _Historias de sexo de gente común_.
-   The _House_ writers like this one, as the second season first episode has House and company treat a convict and both House and Chase get teased with it, Foreman's out convict brother cheerfully says he was barely raped at all, and season 8 has House drop a remark about being raped in jail (though it being House, it's unclear to what degree this was serious).
    -   In one episode when the team were treating a former Mafioso who had decided to testify against the mob, they suspect (correctly) that he may have hepatitis C, which he could only have caught through drug use or gay sex. When the man's brother reacts **very** badly to the suggestion, House points out another possibility — he may have caught it from being raped in prison. This is actually BS, though, and House knows it — _nobody_ is stupid enough to rape a Mafioso. House was just trying to offer the guy a face-saving explanation.
-   What happens to Porfirio Cisneros at the end of the Mexican telenovela _Infames_.
-   In the _The Invisible Man_ pilot, when Kevin offers Darien a chance to avoid prisin by becoming a test subject, Darien protests, "This is my body we're talking about, and you want to play doctor with it?" Kevin, exasperated, asks Darien, "Would you rather your "pen" pals played something else??"
-   _The IT Crowd:_
    
    **Moss:** I can't go to jail, Roy! They'll rape the flip out of me!
    
-   Another female example with Hope Shlottman in _Jessica Jones (2015)_, in which Hope is implied to be her cellmate's Sex Slave.
-   Mentioned in the Canadian comedy show _Just For Laughs_, in a sketch about Canadian-American relations:
    
    "We're bigger, and we're on top. If we were in prison, they'd be our bitch!"
    
    -   Spoken by Rick Mercer, referencing a similar rant on _This Hour Has 22 Minutes_.
-   This happens to Chato in the NBC miniseries _Kingpin_. Unusually, he's actually raped by the _guards_.
-   Threatened on _Las Vegas_ to the point of it being a Running Gag.
-   _Last Week Tonight_ discusses this trope in the episode "Prison". He provides a statistic that 4% of inmates in state and federal prison suffer this fate and seems to find it disturbing and ghoulish that society finds it funny. However, he points out that the risk of this is only one of several ways prisoners in the United States are mistreated.
-   _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_:
    -   An episode of entitled "Fallacy" deals with a pre-operative transgender fighting not to be sent to prison because she fears the men there will rape her. She's sent to jail and ends up in critical care by the end of the episode, having been brutally gang raped by the other inmates - and destined to keep suffering through this for the rest of her sentence. Oddly, at no point does anyone but her seem to realize that she presents a _ridiculously_ large target for this.
    -   In the generally so-bad-it's-good "Wildlife" episode, Stabler and Fin intimidate a rapper named "Gots Money" by rolling a pair of dice, implying that if he goes to prison his cellmate will do the same and then rape him a number of times corresponding to the dice roll.
        
        **Stabler**: Looky here! I "gots" an eleven!
        
    -   A similar episode had a prison rape victim driven to be a serial rapist, going around in his van, snatching men off the street, and raping them. Like the above example, the interviewed a group of lifers who owned "her."
    -   A recent episode sees the return of a date rapist who upon being caught, Elliot and Olivia bragged about how he was going to end up a prison bitch that gets passed around. Although they were mostly trying to scare him, the prisoners really do end up using him just like Olivia and Elliot say they would, resulting in him believing they deliberately set him up. Understandably, he's pissed.
    -   An earlier episode, "Taken", had a man raped and killed in prison after he was falsely accused of raping a 17-year-old girl by a family of con artists. To make matters worse Cragen had made a joke about it earlier in the episode saying that "if there is any karma, Ramsay won't be doing much sitting down in Riker's." Hearing the guy plead to John Munch earlier in the episode was heartbreaking, and at the end, he seemed to be the only one in the cast to consider the possibility the guy was innocent until the con artist admitted that he was just a patsy.
    -   While not actually a prison, a minor was raped while in a mental health facility when his defense convinced the court that his rape of his teacher was caused by some sort of faulty brain set up. The kid's rapist then excused himself of the crime by claiming to have the exact same thing. Unlike most cases, however, something was actually done about it, though it was most likely due to the fact that the kid was still legally a minor.
    -   There was one episode where they had a teen suspect. Currently in the precinct's holding cell was a man arrested for molesting boys who was only too happy to play along with Stabler when he threatened the boy with leaving the two of them alone together, even though they would have been in full view of other officers.
    -   A more sensitive take comes in the episode "Undercover", in which Olivia goes undercover in a women's prison to find and expose a guard who's been raping inmates (and probably killed one of them to stop her testifying against him). He's eventually taken down, though not before he tries to rape Olivia while she's posing as a prisoner.
    -   Although it's rarely a plot point in the flagship show, this is a favorite taunt or threat for the detectives (and sometimes even the prosecutors) to bring up when interrogating a particularly nasty, annoying, smug, stubborn, or otherwise unlikeable suspect / defendant.
        -   This comes back to bite Olivia in the ass in Season 11's "Perverted" when she is framed for murder. The framer was someone Olivia had interrogated in the past and threatened with prison rape. After he was convicted, he would actually be raped during his stay in prison. He believed Olivia had actually arranged for him to be assaulted in prison, and after his release, set out to ruin her life as revenge.
    -   From season 5's "Performance" (about a points-for-sex club that might have led to a rape)
        
        **McCoy**: How many points do you think you'll be worth in prison?
        
    -   An episode involved a kid who received prison for some incredibly minor crime, but was so traumatized by the repeated gang rapes that he came out a killer. As is common in such cases, when McCoy goes to interview the Aryan Brotherhood lifers that abused him, they refer to the victim as "she."
    -   And in another episode where the defendant reveals that a prison guard had turned her into his Sex Slave and that she had him killed because she couldn't put up with it anymore.
-   Alluded to on _Law & Order: UK_, as Matt and Ronnie gang up on a reluctant witness who won't reveal where the perp that they're looking for is hiding out:
    
    **Matt**: Have you ever been in a prison, Kyle? _(turns to Ronnie)_ Who's that bloke we nicked, Ron? Big fella doing ten years for armed robbery in Ashbridge. _(turns back to Kyle)_ Eats nice young boys like you for breakfast.  
    **Ronnie**: Oh, no, he don't eat them, Matt, he—  
    **Matt**: Yes, Ron, I think we got the picture.
    
-   _Life On Mars_:
    -   The penultimate episode in Series 2 has DCI Gene Hunt, now a murder suspect, complain to Sam Tyler, his DI, "You're not the one who's going to have to knit himself a new arsehole after 25 years of aggressive male affection in prison showers!"
    -   In #2.5, Gene Hunt says "I hope he's sharing the cell with a nice big smiley bloke called Honeysuckle."
-   _The L Word_: After Helena goes to jail for stealing her girlfriend Catherine's money, Shane, Tina and Alice have the following advice for Helena: "Don't drop the soap!" She does, and is threatened with it by other inmates before her cellmate stops them.
-   In an episode of _Malcolm in the Middle_, Reese is sent to prison as part of a Scared Straight program, and singled out by Cole Train to recieve a lecture on life in prison, beginning with "Let me tell you, cupcakes, what your first day of being here will be like" and ending with "And don't expect no flowers afterwards."
-   In _The Man Show_, Adam Carolla gets arrested for sexually harassing 2 women at a restaurant before a cop catches him and throws him in federal prison next to his cellmate, a big black man who then invokes this trope.
    
    **Prisoner:** (_to Adam_) Give it to me! Give it to me Sugar Bitch! Ha ha ha!
    
-   _Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere_ had the pair going to prison and Paddy constantly worried about getting "bummed" while saying that Max has nothing to worry about. Despite Paddy's previous... encounter during an earlier episode, nothing of the sort happens, but in their attempts to seem like tough guys to make people keep their hands off them they attack the flamboyant Pepe, "girlfriend" of Raymond the Bastard who essentially owns that wing of the prison. It is largely implied that if Max and Paddy do not agree to Raymond's terms, rape shall be their punishment. Luckily the pair are bailed out before it comes to that.
-   _Miami Vice_ references it when a bad guy's lawyer may be sent to prison, and his future is described as "He will start off a tight end on his way to being a wide receiver".
-   _Murder, She Wrote_ has this be attempted once (possibly twice in the past) in "Tainted Lady". Surprisingly, it's subverted (police officer on prisoner). Sheriff Hays had locked up Ellen, a woman 10+ years younger than him and a woman accused of theft and murder, and tried to rape her both when she was in her late teens and again in her 30's-40's.
-   _Nip/Tuck_ managed to take the jackpot without even showing anything. All it took was two words - "anal retread." That's the type of operation a former inmate blackmails a surgeon into performing on him for free. The patient claims what happened to him wasn't gay - it was about surrendering. During the operation, the surgeon doesn't forget to turn on "How Deep Is Your Love" and mention how loose his patient's anus is.
-   _One Life to Live_: When Powell, Todd, and Zach are sent to prison for gang-raping Marty Saybrooke, ringleader Todd taunts Powell, who had turned them in, with the likelihood that this would happen to him (it didn't).
-   _Orange Is the New Black_:
    -   Subverted, as sex between inmates seen on the show is consensual. Discussed during "Bora Bora Bora" when the guards and inmates giving the tour pretend it's common, and also when Alex plays with Pennsatucky's fears of this.
    -   This is played for laughs when several of the prisoners are participating in a scared straight program, trying to frighten a group of adolescent delinquents into better behavior by telling them terrifying stories about life in prison. When protagonist Piper Chapman just happens to walk in on the group while on her way to use the bathroom, the other prisoners, trying to scare a particularly hardened delinquent, threaten to leave her with Chapman, describing her as a notorious lesbian rapist. It's funny because their description is so at odds with Chapman's real personality, and real reputation.
    -   There's also an episode in which Vause threatens to do this to Pennsatucky, although, from the way Vause phrases it, she makes it seem as though the real threat is that Pennsatucky, who has, shall we say, old-fashioned attitudes toward homosexuality, will enjoy it so much that she will turn gay.
    -   It's also subverted with Daya and Bennett. Their relationship is portrayed as entirely consensual, even though legally it's considered rape since an inmate can't consent to sex with a CO. This is why even though Daya seduced Mendez, he ended up in prison for rape.
    -   On the other hand, Mendez routinely trades drugs for sex, and attempts to pressure Sophia into this in exchange for hormones when the doctors cut her prescription off. Morello is terrified of him for this exact reason, and Diaz takes advantage of the popular opinion of Mendez to seduce him and then claim he raped her to cover up her pregnancy.
    -   In season 3 Pensatucky is raped by Coates in the prison van.
-   _Oz_ has many instances of this, realistically portrayed and very disturbing. Rather perversely, many of the rapes perpetrated on this show are said to be against cast and crew that show up late to work.
-   Averted in _Porridge_, where, while sexual tensions and possible assaults are touched upon, they are not dwelt upon, and the main homosexual character, Lukewarm, is a harmless Pet Homosexual. Prison Rape is much rarer in the UK penal system — that's not to say it doesn't happen, but there's a lot less of it about. This is at least partially because the gang culture in UK prisons is less pronounced.
-   _Prison Break_ tends to suggest it more than actually give raping scenes, but it's obvious Fox River has lots of this instances.
    -   This is what happens to Tweener. Initally stalked by T-Bag (his previous bitch having committed suicide), until Michael puts a stop to it. Then later on, Captain Bellick threatens to have him "up for sale" to any prisoner looking for a "bitch" if he doesn't snitch on Michael. Tweener's snitching proves fruitless, so Bellick puts him in a cell with the sex criminal Avocado who immediately rapes him.
    -   The teenage boy who T-Bag received as a 'gift' from his Aryan brothers. T-Bag raped the boy repeatedly until he committed suicide.
    -   It's implied that Bellick is raped in his first day in a Panamanian prison. Karma is a bitch.
    -   It doesn't actually happen to Michael (well at least as far as we know), but T-Bag repeatedly threatens to rape him throughout the series.
-   Alluded to in an episode of _Pushing Daisies_ in which Ned is arrested on suspicion of murder.
    
    **Emerson:** This might be a sweeping generalization but I don't think an attractive man who bakes pies for a living should spend any amount of time in prison.
    
-   _Red Dwarf_:
    
    -   In "Back in the Red", the cast is sent to prison, largely because of the backstabbing of Rimmer. In the first non-flashback set in the prison, Lister dumps a vial of the "sexual magnetism virus" on Rimmer, and the episode ends as all the inmates start groping him.
    -   At the start of the saga, Rimmer shows his credentials on his re-introduction.
    
    **Lister:** (ref. to his sentence) Two years without sex...  
    **Rimmer:** You hope.
    
-   Hinted at in _The Red Green Show_. During one round of the Possum Lodge Word Game, Red has to get former convict Mike Hammer to say the word "slip". With time running out, he offers the hint that it's something people are afraid will happen to them in the shower.
    
    **Mike:** _\[horrified expression\]_ ...At home or in prison?  
    **Red:** At home.  
    **Mike:** _\[flatly\]_ Oh. Slip.
    
-   On an episode of _Reno 911!_ Deputy Junior tells a very detailed and graphic story to a horrified group of kids visiting the jail about a Mormon kid being brutally gang raped in one of the cells.
-   _Saturday Night Live_:
    
    -   In the recurring skit "Scared Straight" Keenan Thompson (often joined by the Host of the Week) talks to some teens about the dangers of going to prison, most of which involves prison rape.
    -   One of the "Roxbury Brothers" skits had the titular characters getting thrown in prison after basically assaulting a woman at a dance club—surrounding her and bouncing her back and forth between them (this is a repeated occurrence in these sketches) Two of the brothers are taken out of the cell while the remaining one is surrounded by the other prisoners, who proceed to toss him around just as he and his brothers did the woman. It's played for laughs, of course, but it's pretty obvious what this represents.
    -   One skit features Jerry Seinfeld going to Oz in a parody of both that show and his own. In a version of _Seinfeld_'s "The Contest'' episode, Jerry makes a bet with O'Reilly, Schillinger, and Augustus on who can go the longest without committing male rape. They all lose, including Jerry!
    -   Norm Macdonald frequently joked about this on Weekend Update.
    
    “Across the nation this Monday, banks and government offices will be closed in observance of Martin Luther King's birthday. Meanwhile, at the Riverbend Maximum Security Prison in Nashville, Dr. King's assassin, James Earl Ray, will spend the day being _raped continuously_.”
    
-   In one episode of _The Sentinel_, Jim infiltrates a prison as an inmate. In the showers, another inmate announces he'll have his ass whether Jim wants it or not, but his target being Jim, all he gets is a beatdown.
-   In an episode of _Smallville_, Lois laughingly speculates that a young quarterback is making up his story of not remembering committing a crime because he wants to avoid "playing 'tight end'" for the local penitentiary.
-   _Sons of Anarchy_ explicitly shows two characters being raped in prison. The first is Big Otto in season 5 at the hands of his guards, thanks to Lee Toric's attentions; the second is Juice Ortiz in season 7 — twice, once by Tully and once as a gang-rape by the minions of the mob boss he had just killed. His acceptance is the worst part.
-   _Strong Medicine_: After Lu is raped, her friend Peter tries to comfort her and claims to know how she feels. Lu angrily tells him, "Unless you've spent some serious time in the joint, I don't think so!"
-   _Supernatural_ only alluded to it in "Folsom Prison Blues" — Dean gets a taunt when they arrive, he makes a joke and acts like it was directed at Sam.
-   British sketch comedy series _Swingers_ featured the 'gay men enjoy prison' version, played for laughs: one ongoing storyline features a British man locked up in a foreign country who has obviously been enjoying whatever's been going on with his attractive young Latin cellmate. In fact, he's having so much fun he confesses to the crime he's been falsely accused of and to several _other_ crimes...which comes back to bite him in the ass, as he learns soon after that his cellmate's violent older brother is being transferred to the same prison and is planning to do unpleasant things to the man who's been 'corrupting' his brother.
-   _Two and a Half Men_:
    -   In one episode Berta (the family's housekeeper) brings Prudence, her sixteen-year-old granddaughter, to Charlie's house so she can keep an eye on her while she works. At one point, Prudence flirts with Charlie but Charlie, obviously fearing this trope, immediately backs off:
        
        **Charlie:** I'm sorry Prudence. I mean you're very nice and pretty, but in prison, **so am I**.
        
    -   Also mentioned in the episode written by the CSI writers. An investigator implies this will happen to Charlie if he gets sent to prison. He says he will try to prevent it by taping his butt closed. The investigator tells him that never helps. Charlie then has an Imagine Spot of himself getting raped in prison.
        
        **Rapist:** I love it when it's gift-wrapped.
        
-   _Veronica Mars_ is truly all over the place with rape; one of the running gags in the _first season_, when one of the Arcs is Veronica trying to find out who raped her, is mocking someone who's heading to adult prison with a pronouncement of "Community soap."
-   _Walker, Texas Ranger_:
    -   The titular character walks into an interrogation room and tells the prisoner "If you don't tell me what I want to know, I'm going to put the word out that you like guys with big—". It cuts to the outside of the room at that point and we never hear what word he used, but the preceding words and the guy's reaction make it obvious what he was getting at.
    -   Also, when Alex is imprisoned. A sleazy defendant who she was prosecuting taunts her father and Walker about her "learning new skills" while in jail. The men's reaction is precisely what you'd expect from a woman's father and boyfriend. She is in fact attacked at one point, and while not a rape, the scene does give off this vibe.
-   A rare female example in _Weeds_, when an imprisoned Celia complains that her cellmate wants her to be her "special friend."
-   In one _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_ scenes from a hat skit, they got "bad songs to sing in prison."
    
    **Wayne**: (Broadway style) "Whose the slightly effeminate one? That's me!"  
    **Brad**: (funk style) "Who dropped the soap?... Who dropped the soap?"
    
-   _The Wire_:
    -   Mentioned several times. At one point a young character freaks out, because he's heard that there's a gang war going on at Juvie and "guys are getting raped!"
    -   When Omar is framed for a murder and briefly incarcerated in season four, he comes under immediate attack from most of the other inmates on the basis of having robbed many of them before, being homosexual, and having a five-figure bounty on his head. When one of them tries to stab him, he manages to disarm him and, before returning the favor, kisses his ear and tells him, "It's a shame we didn't have more time together; we could have made us a couple of babies." Apart from serving to terrify the man, this is possibly a callback to season one, where Stinkum reports that when Bird jailed with Omar, he had a "whole stable of boys" at his beck and call.
-   _Wiseguy_. A woman asks Vinnie how he survived 18 months in a federal pen — Vinnie claims he "married the toughest guy there and he fought off all the others". Hilariously averted when corrupt media mogul Winston Newquay is locked in a cell, and a Scary Black Man twice his size crawls out from under the bunk and starts to take off his shirt...only to start auditioning himself to Newquay with an air-guitar rendition of "Soul Man". The episode ends on them singing a duet.
-   _Without a Trace_. The agents occasionally like to taunt suspects with the possibility of this happening to them. In one episode, Jack Malone essentially threatens a crippled boy with being sent to prison and resultant Prison Rape unless he tells him where he's put the missing person of the week.
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   Fox Mulder uses this as an interrogation technique in "Terma": "You want to know about anarchy? You don’t tell me where that other bomb is and I'll make sure you spend your prison time on your bigoted hands and knees putting a big smile on some convict’s face".
    -   A rare female example in (the highly flippant and self-parodic) episode "Bad Blood": Mulder tries to convince Scully she might be a co-defendant, and to stick with his story that the man he stabbed in the chest was a vampire.
        
        _"Prison, Scully. Your cellmate's nickname is gonna be Large Marge. She's gonna read a lotta Gertrude Stein..."_
        
    -   In another self-parodic episode, "Jose Chung's ''From Outer Space''", Mulder explicitly threatens a seemingly-uncooperative rape suspect with rape in prison.
    -   Probably unsurprisingly, there’s at least one comment about this made in reference to Langly of the Lone Gunmen. Byers, Frohike and Langly, before they truly became the Gunmen, have been put in jail in connection with a break-in and shootout at a warehouse. Frohike, needling Langly, says: “You know, with that long blonde hair, you’ll be the first one in here that gets traded for cigarettes. I’m gonna be laughing my ass off.”
-   _The Young and the Restless_:
    -   A cellmate makes several lewd advances to the wrongly jailed Nick, who was released before anything could happen.
    -   While imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit (ironic, given the many despicable things he DID do), Kevin was beaten up by his fellow inmates. While he wasn't raped, there was still an air of Does This Remind You of Anything? about the whole sequence.
-   _The Young Ones_:
    
    **Rick:** Mike! You bastard! I can't go to prison! I'm too pretty! I'll be raped!
    
    -   Spared from being Black Comedy Rape because it's so clearly Rick's unjustified belief that he's good-looking that's being poked fun at.
    -   "Oh, no! I killed a hippy. I'll go to prison, and be raped in the shower by Mr Big, who's in with the wardens."

    Music 

-   In the Blink182 song "I Won't be Home for Christmas", the narrator is sent to prison and molested if not outright raped.
-   The Bloodhound Gang's "I Hope You Die" describes how the subject of the song will hopefully go to prison for (accidental) vehicular homicide, and be put in the same cell as someone called Bowling Ball Bag Bob:
    
    What happens next is all a blur / But you remember that "fist" can be a verb.  
    And when you finally regain consciousness / You're bound and gagged in a wedding dress.  
    And the prison guard looks the other way / 'Cause he's the guy you flipped the bird the other day.
    
-   _The Bob & Tom Show_ song "Prisoner of Love" is a duet between a prison inmate and the cellmate he's forcing himself on, which is rendered hideously funny by its spot-on mimicry of a doo-wop love ballad — if you've heard another such song, ever, in your life, you can perfectly predict the melody — contrasted with the horrid content of the lyrics: "You're not like all the others, too bad they had to die!"
    -   Tom also has an annoying habit (among many) of working a prison sodomy crack into nearly every crime news story.
-   Bowling for Soup's video of "The Bitch Song" involves the band being sent to prison, with all that that and the song title implies (the song itself, however, is about the singer's girlfriend).
-   Used as a throwaway joke in one of the Gorillaz interviews, as they discuss Murdoc's jail time in Mexico.
    
    **Murdoc:** Ugh, prison food. I don't think I'll eat another burrito the rest of my life.  
    **2D:** Yeah, but you had your share of Mexican sausage, eh Muds?  
    **Murdoc:** Oh shaddup you little fu—
    
-   Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's "The Message" contains a rather serious take on the subject, referring to a man who goes to prison, then becomes an "undercover fag" with his manhood being taken. Finally, the man commits suicide.
-   Rich Hall's character, Otis Lee Crenshaw (a country and western singing former convict), begins one of his songs with the intro "Y'know, prison rape has always gotten kinda a bad name." (the song is called "He almost looks like you.")
-   Megadeth's 1992 song "Captive Honour" tells the story of an arrogant protagonist who is sent to prison and...well...finds out for himself that he's not as tough as he thought he was.
    
    "Inside the big house his nightmare unfolds  
    Before he got there, his manpussy was sold  
    Black blanket welcome, this tough guy's now a bitch  
    Praying for death, it can't be worse than this."
    
-   My Chemical Romance have a song called "You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison." The title says it all, and the song features verses about being in prison along with the chorus "We're just two men as God had made us." Screaming and distorted vocals in the song give it a dark tone. The version from the Life On the Murder Scene EP has Gerard starting the song off by explaining it as being the story of a "beautiful boy who done went to jail". Just in case there was any hint of doubt.
-   Nirvana's "Rape Me." The singer in this case is playing a victim of everyday non-prison rape, but the "I'm not the only one" line is directed at her attacker; he'll get his when he gets to jail. Or maybe Hell.
-   On the "tasteless joke" front, the last track on The Offspring's _Splinter_ album is "When You're In Prison," a guide to avoiding prison rape in the form of a '40s-style ballad. Complete with cheerful chorus of female voices at the end.
-   The Rodney Carrington doo-wop number "Prison Bitch" is another one played for Black Comedy.
-   Slick Rick's "The Moment I Feared" plays this for Black Comedy. after at least a good two days worth of a Humiliation Conga, Rick gets busted for both drug and murder charges, and is explicitly gang raped at the end of the song:
    
    _This was the moment I feared...  
    "Turn around nigga (HAHAHAHA) Spread your cheeks"  
    This was the moment I feared...  
    "UHH, AOWWHWHWAA! STOP STOP! AHAOWWHAHAOOHO"_
    
-   The song "Date Rape" by Sublime tells a story of a man who rapes a girl he meets in a bar, goes to jail, and is in turn raped himself, in a sort of poetic justice. The singer says in the end that he can't really find it in himself to feel sorry for him after what he did. For bonus points the music video casts porn star Ron Jeremy as both the judge and the prison rapist.
-   The tool song "Prison Sex" is a subversion. You'd think the subject is about this, given the title, but Word of God is it's about child abuse (more specifically how being abused as a child makes the viewpoint character take it out on someone else in turn) and the "prison" is metaphorical.
-   On the Frank Zappa album _Joe's Garage_, the protagonist Joe is "plooked" in prison during the song "Keep it Greasey." "Dong Work for Yuda," the preceding song, sings of Joe's rapist's generous gifts in the genitals department, just so the audience knows how awful Joe's going to have it.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   WWE surprisingly did this in 1991. They shot and aired a vignette with The Mountie in prison as a man with a gay lisp asks him if he likes the feeling of leather against his skin.

    Tabletop Games 

-   A recent editorial in the Los Angeles Times criticizing the use of Black Comedy Rape (particularly Prison Rape) mentioned a board game called _Don't Drop the Soap!_ in which the players are prisoners, and the one who bends over to pick up dropped soap is at risk of getting raped.

    Theater 

-   A Scary Black Man (who else) and the titular Anti-Hero of _Edmond_.
-   Subverted in ''A Gulag Mouse", where Anastasia is forced by the other inmates into "visiting the guard shack" to trade sex for food, but it is eventually revealed that she kills the guard and steals his gun to make an escape attempt instead.
-   Joked about in the song "The Big Doll House" from _Hairspray_. When Edna complains about needing a conjugal visit in jail the matron advises her to "just drop the soap in the big doll house."
-   Referenced in _Speed-the-Plow_ which features a movie pitch made by one of the characters for a prison-set action film that involves the threat of this. _Also by a Scary Black Man_.
-   Keeping with history, this happens to Clyde Barrow in _Bonnie and Clyde_ while he's in Eastham and leads to him committing his first murder and the Never Going Back to Prison mentality that stayed throughout their robberies.

    Video Games 

-   In _Alice: Madness Returns_, Alice threatens Bumby with this: "In prison, some half-wit bruiser will make you his sweetheart!"
-   The would-have-been Gizmondo Killer App _Colors_, a Wide-Open Sandbox GTA-clone, presented prison rape as an option after the player gets arrested: To get out, the player can pay anywhere between $20,000 and $7,000, or just let the fat, bearded inmate sodomize him so that you'll be sent to the infirmary where he can escape.
-   In _Dark Elf Historia_, failing certain quests results in Fraylia being framed for major crimes and sent to prison. One of the first things she endures is being thrown in lockup with a bunch of male inmates, with precisely the results you'd expect, and a cursory look around the prison dorms shows that she's not the only one getting this treatment.
-   Referred to in _Fallout: New Vegas_ - if you visit the NCR Correctional Facility with Straight Gay companion Arcade Gannon, the (former) inmates mention they used to trade men like him.
-   Losing to a Prison Guard in _Fear & Hunger_ while their “stinger” is intact will have this trope done in very non-humorous manner, leading to a scene where it is all but stated that the protagonist gets raped. You end up waking up suffering anal bleeding and with both legs missing, stuffed in a pile of dead bodies afterward.
    -   Recruiting Cahara for the first time has him found in a locked prison cell, with his dialogue implying he suffered this fate from a guard. Thankfully for you, he lacks the penalties you end up with from the start.
-   _Grand Theft Auto_:
    -   _Grand Theft Auto: Vice City_ had a reference to it.
        
        **Umberto Robina:** You have proved yourself, man. You got big cojones.  
        **Tommy Vercetti:** Well thank you, Umberto. Nobody's said that to me since I left jail.
        
    -   _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_:
    -   When C.J.'s brother Sweet, who gets thrown in prison following Smoke and Ryder's betrayal, people keep C.J. in line by threatening to have this down to Sweet. Mike Toreno threatens to give Sweet a new cellmate named "Horse Cock Harry" give them a big tube of lube. Tenpenny suggests that Sweet could end up on a Ballas' cellblock "getting in touch with his feminine side" if C.J. doesn't follow orders.
        -   The game also has another example with O.G. Loc, a petty criminal whose first order of business after getting out of prison is finding his cellmate who raped him and killing him, with Carl's assistance. It may be a subversion, however, since dialogue with said cellmate implies that it may have been consensual, specially considering that he says "he broke my heart" when ordering his fellow gang members to attack O.G. Loc.
        -   Early when Sweet calls Carl, Sweet talks about other inmates attempting to "jump him."
    -   _Grand Theft Auto IV_:
        -   Protagonist Niko Bellic mentions during a conversation that while he did spend time in Eastern European prisons, the whole prison bitch thing is a specifically American feature of incarcerated life. Which... probably isn't entirely accurate, at least not in Russia. In fact, it might very well be universal, as it's pretty much Older Than anything you care to name.
        -   Early on, during the "The Master and The Molotov" mission, Mikhail Faustin implies that he protected Dimitri Rascalov from being raped in prison.
            
            **Mikhail Faustin**: You think Dimitri would have survived prison without me? He'd just be some prison queen, had I not been there. Meat for some gym monkey!
            
-   There are rumors that a GTA-style Judge Mathis game is in production where the player will get to experience the joy of prison rape. See this page.
-   _Mafia II_: An unnamed prisoner along with a few of his goons bribe one of the guards to give them time alone with Vito in the showers to pull this trope, and judging by the guards reaction, it's not the first time. However, Vito ends up beating the shit out of them for it, and while he gets a stint in solitary for it, no one ever tries to pull that on him crap again.
    
    **Guard**: Alright, get your kicks in, you sick animals!
    
-   _Mass Effect 2_:
    -   If you wander into the Citadel bar Men's restroom, female ex-convict Jack will talk about a time she was jumped in the prison restroom and gang-raped. She hunted them down and killed them all afterwards.
    -   One of the inmates at Purgatory will imply this in an optional conversation:
        
        "They'll take everything, your smokes, your clothes, your... pride. I haven't showered in three months."
        
-   In _Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath_, Looten Duke does not want to share a jail cell with Blisterz Booty again, because he has "dignity".
-   In _PAYDAY 2_, Hoxton mentions this offhand as the crew are breaking him out of prison. According to him, Thursdays are particularly dangerous.
-   _Randal's Monday_: Threatened in the prison chapter, but things do not end well for those who threatened it.
-   After you rescue Oleg in _Saints Row: The Third_, Pierce comments that the last time a giant naked man offered to help him, it didn't end well.
    -   Earlier on when incompetent actor and wannabe bank robber Josh Birk sets off a Syndicate bank alarm, Shaundi asks "Are you trying to get us all jail time?" Josh freaks out, citing "I don't wanna be some dude's bitch!"
    -   A more subtle one in _Saints Row 2_, where one of the whiteboards for in the prison guard's staff room says "Don't drop the soap."
-   Almost occurs in _Skies of Arcadia_ during Vyse's second entry (i.e. imprisonment) in the Grand Fortress; Aika is harassed and about to be raped by the admiral Vigoro; thankfully Vyse and Gilder show up in time. The implications of rape were heavily toned down in the English localization of the game.
-   It's never explicitly mentioned in _The Suffering_, although there was a minor lampshading when an inmate tells Torque "You don't know what you're missing!" There was also another NPC who reveals that he's gay after you find the corpse of an inmate he was looking for, and there's a bloody bar of soap in the bathroom.
-   Implied in _Dragon Age: Origins_ DLC Leliana's Song where the Big Bad asks if she wanted more men, and when she's seen crying there is some suspiciously placed blood.
-   In _World of Warcraft_, Millhouse Manastorm mentions that his time imprisoned in Tempest Keep taught him two very important lessons: survival, and how to hold your soap.

    Visual Novels 

-   Implied to be the case in _Danganronpa V3_'s Salmon Team bonus mode. One of the options you have when bringing Ryoma to the gym is asking “Ah, maybe we should take off our clothes...?” His response? “Stop. I'm having flashbacks from prison.”
-   Invoked by the protagonist of _Daughter for Dessert_. After going to jail for breaking and entering, he doesn’t shower until Saul bails him out.
-   In _Lucky Dog 1_ if the player fails to break out of prison in Giulio's route, this is the bad ending. Giulio and Luchino are transferred to separate prisons, Bernardo is murdered and Ivan leaves for another gang — making the CR:5 powerless/broken in the prison, leaving Gian absolutely helpless and he gets taken as a sex toy by the rival gang.

    Web Animation 

-   One of Raimi's Awesome Moments in _Broken Saints_ Chapter 19, Act 3: he threatens Mars with sending fake child pornography to the FBI from Mars' e-mail account, saying he'll smile at thinking of what the prison boys are gonna do to that scumbag...
-   _Napster Bad_: In the original Flash short, Lars Ulrich warns the viewers that sharing illegal MP3 files will get you locked up in jail and gang-raped.
-   _Queer Duck_: The episode "B.S. I Love You" ends with Queer Duck being sent to prison for trespassing on Barbara Streisand's property and his burly cellmate complimenting his beak. Given that this is Queer Duck we're talking about, he actually likes that his cellmate is interested in him in that way.

    Webcomics 

-   _8-Bit Theater_: Played for laughs in this episode.
-   Spoof war-story-in-pictures _Bumrape Island_ _began_ as a craggy-jawed epic about a lone Australian soldier's escape from a sadistic Japanese prison camp. After selective editing with a ballpoint pen and tippex, it became an unforgettable account of one plucky Aussie's escape from a lot of camp Japanese with a yen for anal rape.
-   In _Least I Could Do_ it was a running gag here,here, and here
-   Not shown, but discussed in this and this _Loserz_ strip.
-   _Ménage à 3_: When Gary is afraid that Yuki will turn him in for accidentally molesting her, he says to Dillon: "Just remember me fondly as I get butt-raped daily in jail."
-   In _The Order of the Stick_, Thog states he's "too pretty for jail." Also the gem, "nale tell thog, don't drop soap."
-   _Questionable Content_: Marten is too pretty to go to prison.
-   Kevin Lee of _Sexy Losers_ in this strip. He is very gay and also a bit of a masochist so the other prisoners decide not to rape him after all.
-   _Sinfest_:
-   Kharisma in a female example in this _Something\*Positive_. It's only implied, and that vaguely, but many still rejoiced in seeing her punished in any way.
    -   The comic's other Asshole Victim, Mike, has a close call when arrested, sharing a cell with a hulking brute who dribbles for a Beat Panel before declaring him "purty". Aubrey says that if she posts his bail, she'll "own his ass". Mike replies "At least you won't move in."
-   Narrowly avoided in _String Theory (2009)_, to Schtein's relief.
-   _Super Rivals_: Avoided at the start of the comic when Latex Scorpion fights off sexual extortion from two female prisoner's while serving a sentance in the Moustrap. During the scuffle however she accidentally breaks one of their Power Nullifier's, fortunately Awesome Girl arrives to break up the altercation before things can get more violent.
-   In this strip of the _Magic: The Gathering_ webcomic _UG Madness_, Dominic ends up in jail and his cellmate makes him...play _Yu-Gi-Oh!_. Which, to the characters of the comic, is probably just as bad as rape.
-   In _Umlaut House_ once displayed the reason Rick was paroled. Forcibly.
    
    **Rick:** Oh dear! I have dropped the soap, and shall have to bend far, far, over to pick it back up again!
    
-   Played for laughs in this _User Friendly_ strip.
-   In a _VG Cats_ strip we have the creators of _Katamari Damacy_ going on trial because it is assumed that they were partaking in the use of illegal substances while making the game. Leo, the judge, is playing his game in excitement before realizing that the term 'roll a Katamari' can sound a _lot_ like a slang term for doing drugs, which leads to this dialogue:
    
    **Leo:** _Ooooh_... "Roll a Katamari". Heh, that's pretty clever.  
    **The Prince:** So can I go home now?  
    **Leo:** No, no, no. It's soap on a rope for you.
    

    Web Original 

-   Used as a threat in _Dead West_, as the narrator and his friend were mistaken as spies. The sheriff says if they fess up, he might let the "lady" spend the night at his house; if they don't, he will chain up Gervas in a solitary cell and put the Porcelain Doctor together with the other prisoners. Gervas understands the threat, but the Porcelain Doctor is oblivious, and declines the offer. Averted with the fact that after he had been put together with the murderers, he easily fought them off, and Gervas breaks out of his own cell to pluck his friend out of trouble. Then they decide to stay in prison after all (breaking out would be a crime), so they leave the beaten guys in their relocked cell, and return to Gervas' slightly better one. They are still sleeping there when the real sheriff returns.
-   A particularly depraved example is seen in the Harmsters in _Hamster's Paradise_, where the Grotesque Cute sapient hamster-descendants known as the harmsters play off this trope to a dreadful degree. One advanced species, the tundra harmster, captures and enslaves two other harmster species, using them as breeding stock in an attempt to evolve themselves further, often drugging, lobotomizing or mutilating them to get them to comply. Eventually, the enslaved harmsters are selectively bred into the non-sapient, animalistic Brutes that they use as hounds and oxen— yet some still breed with them, which causes one harmster faction known as the Frazettas to devolve into monstrous, primal cannibals.
-   _Shadow of the Templar_:
    -   In this web-published novel series, Mike makes this comment regarding Farraday being released from jail:
        
        **Mike:** For one thing, I bet his asshole's hanging a little looser.
        
    -   Also referenced to by Simon when he tries to persuade Jeremy to hand back the Morning Star to him:
        
        **Simon:** Probably you'll be fending off all the large sweaty men who want you to call them "daddy." Put it down! Now!
        
-   _Tails of the Bounty Hunter_ has multiple scenes in the final chapter revealing what all of the five major villains are doing now that they've been incarcerated. Fittingly, Gobor Grizzer, who was a Serial Rapist, is raped in prison.
-   Featured in the disclaimer on certain kinds of NSFW original fiction on the 'net: _Anyone acting out such scenarios in "real life" can look forward to many unproductive years getting it up the butt by a fellow convict in their local prison._

    Web Videos 

-   The video _Big Gay Bubba_, in which the titular Bubba sings about raping his fellow inmates.
-   In _Brows Held High_, Oancitizen happily jokes about prison rape in several videos (such as his video for _Pinocchio_), which is significant because he repeatedly voices his disdain for other rape jokes and other Dude, Not Funny! subjects.
-   During the _Game Grumps_' playthrough of _Sonic Boom_:
    
    **Danny:** _\[quoting from the game\]_ "Let's see what a thousand years in prison will do to you!" _\[normal conversation\]_ I dunno... Bet there's a lot of buttsex. _\[Beat; as the game character\]_ "Thousand years of buttsex!"
    
-   InTheLittleWood: During Martyn's Let's Play of _The Escapists_ he opts to clear his inventory by getting rid of some items. Unfortunately he decided to get rid of a bar of soap (since he had two of them) while he was standing in the shower, quickly leading him to remark that he Didn't Think This Through with the Unfortunate Implications.
    
    **Martyn:** No, no, no, no, no no no. Let's just go to lunch and forget that ever happened.
    
-   The Pop Culture Detective explores how common jokes about men being sexually assaulted, the most common being prison rape jokes, are here.
-   A Running Gag with the SomeOrdinaryGamers Deep Web Exploration series, which advises viewers not to do anything illegal over the deep web unless they want to become Bubba's new cell-mate.
-   In Your Chonny's _Judge Judy_ parody after the Plaintiff constantly interrupt the judge:
    
    **Judge:** Quiet! Or I'll put you in contempt!  
    **Plaintiff:** What's contempt?  
    **Judge:** I don't know... But I'll make sure you get raped!
    
-   A simple story about getting a functioning lightsaber in the mail somehow leads to promises of brutal vengeance: "I'm gonna make sure you guys get locked up in a \*raping\* jail!"

    Western Animation 

-   _American Dad!_:
    -   In "Star Trek", Roger references this, telling Steve:
        
        _"Sorry, pal. You're going to jail, where they're gonna take your cherry... Jell-O away... in the lunch line... after you're raped... in the shower."_
        
    -   In one episode, Steve convinces Stan to visit his father Jack in prison, and this topic comes up.
        
        **Jack:** They'll break my rump in like a new baseball glove!  
        **Stan:** _Right_ in front of the kid, that's nice.
        
-   _Archer_: In Season 8, "Dreamland", Dirty Cop Figgis is planning to have Archer arrested for his involvement in the Tunt kidnapping plot, and tells him the other prisoners will be passing him around for half a pack of cigarettes. Archer protests that he's worth at least two packs.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
    -   Azula's **notorious** "favourite prisoner" comment (which, it should be noted, is in reference to Suki). There is no possible way that the writers were unaware of the implications of _that_, and the animators and voice actor went with it in the delivery.
    -   "Avatar Day" has Aang thrown in jail for a crime Avatar Kyoshi committed, under the Insane Troll Logic that his past self did it, so he was somehow responsible. While Katara and Sokka go to clear his name, there's a shot of Aang in prison, where a group of huge, tough-looking convicts talk about how they think Aang's going to get along _really_ well with them. Cue cut to a different scene. When the episode gets back to Aang, we see that the convicts have, indeed, become friends with him and are kindly giving him relationship advice about his crush on Katara.
    -   Implied in "The Boiling Rock, Part 1" when Sokka, disguised as a guard, sneaks into his girlfriend Suki's cell and makes kissy faces at her... _before_ removing his disguise. Appropriately, Suki knocks him on his butt. A female prison guard who stumbles upon Zuko keeping guard also suspects that this is happening in Suki's cell and, to her credit, isn't having any of it. In the same episode, the warden implies that this could happen to Zuko if the other prisoners find out his true identity as well.
-   At the end of the _Batman: The Animated Series_ episode "The Terrible Trio", when we see Warren Lawford, aka the Fox, put into a prison cell this is the implication of what's to come given a sinister amused grin given by his new rather burly cellmate. Especially ironic since the last we saw of Lawford, he was bragging about how his rich and influential family would get him off scot-free. He apparently forgot about the fact that all his victims were rich and influential too.
-   _Beavis and Butt-Head_ had an episode where Todd is hiding at the duo's house, and being the Ungrateful Bastard that he is, when they call him from jail (after getting beaten up by the cops and arrested for obstruction of justice because they wouldn't say where Todd was), he just tells them "don't drop the soap". They don't get raped, but instead end up in the same cell as two other gang members who hate Todd and proceed to beat them up again.
-   _The Boondocks_:
    -   Tom DuBois is shown to suffer a highly pronounced irrational fear of going to prison and being anally raped there; this stems from watching a prison movie with a graphic rape scene when he was a little kid, which partly explains why he's such a straight-laced, law-abiding citizen (and also a prosecutor who ironically, has presumably sent other men to the fate he fears so much). On the downside, his wife Sarah is (sexually) frustrated by all of his constant anxiety.
    -   In "A Date with the Health Inspector" and "A Date with the Booty Warrior", Tom winds up seeing the inside of a jail twice (in the former episode, he was wrongly detained and questioned by the police for a crime he didn't commit; and in the latter one, he was chaperoning several boys on a Scare 'Em Straight field trip to a local prison). And in both instances, he worries about the possibility of almost getting anally raped (the latter time was justified, because _there really was_ a rapist who was out to get him). But thankfully, he comes out of both misadventures with his ass intact.
-   _CatDog_ hints at this trope at the end of the episode "CatDog Catcher". Rancid Rabbit ends up incarcerated after spending the episode jailing everyone in Nearburg for not owning a license for their species (all just so he'd have enough gold coins to bathe in). He has a burly cellmate standing behind him who grabs him from off-screen as the episode irises out.
-   _The Cleveland Show_:
    -   In one episode, Cleveland believes Holt had murdered his overbearing mother (the "victim" that Holt kept referencing was actually a sex doll he was getting rid of), and contacts the police. When Cleveland is worried over what will happen to Holt, the chief says that "a short, lithe, fitness nut" like him will be very popular in prison.
        
        **Cleveland:** He gonna get tore up.
        
    -   Played horrifyingly straight when Cleveland is put in prison for a murder he didn't commit, and the rest of the episode revolves around Freight Train, Junior, and Rollo solving the murder (Freight Train moonlights as a detective novelist and plans to turn the mystery into a story). Cut to 14 months later at the book release party where Donna suddenly remembers that _they forgot to get Cleveland released!_ It then cuts to Cleveland, crying and putting on makeup in his jail cell while singing "What A Wonderful World" in a shaky, traumatized voice.
        
        **Cleveland:** I'm never gonna be the same...
        
-   The _Clone High_ episode "Litter Kills Litterally" has Gandhi being accidentally incarcerated. He's very nervous about prison rape, especially because the other inmates keep ominously referring to the shower. When they finally corner him for his 'initiation', it's completely innocent, of the 'three cheers' variety. They then listen, sympathetically, as he discusses his grief over the death of Ponce de Leon. When this is revealed, one inmate says "Damn, boy! What'd you think we were going to do? Make _love_ to you?" Then they all laugh, except for one guy who just keeps creepily staring at Gandhi...
-   An episode of _Code Monkeys_ where the cast (including the girls) gets sent to prison, named "Rapeville State Penitentiary". No one actually gets raped, despite their taking bets on who will be violated first.
-   _The Critic_: After having a meltdown on the set of his show while reviewing the atrocious _Ghost Chasers 3_, which includes indecent exposure and telling L.A. street gangs to go murder the studio executives, Jay is sent to jail for 30 days, where it's implied this happens to him with his burly cellmate. It's then subverted when it turns out the prisoner is the most considerate relationship Jay's ever had (it's never revealed whether or not the prisoner actually raped him).
    
    **Prisoner:** I got you some popcorn, extra butter, just the way you like it.  
    **Jay:** You know, this is the best relationship I've ever had!
    
-   Subverted in an episode of the _Earthworm Jim_ cartoon. Jim, through a series of events as outlandish as they are hilarious, finds himself in prison without his supersuit. When he is introduced to his cellmate, Walter, the man reaches for Jim with an amourous grin...before using Jim as dental floss. And judging by Jim's screams, it is not pleasant.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   Subverted in "Death Has a Shadow", when Peter is sent to jail for fraud, he says on his first day: "All of the rumors about dropping the soap are true!" He then goes on to say: "You can't hold onto that thing to save your life. It was slipping all over the place." This is of course followed by two prisoners pointing and laughing at Peter for his inability to hang onto the soap.
    -   Subverted again in "One If by Clam, Two If by Sea"; after being framed for arson of a British pub, many of the inmates are commenting that they intend to rape Peter. Peter, however, is taking all of the comments as compliments, appearing to be completely unaware of their intent, until he says, "they are going to be bummed to know I'm not gay but everyone is so nice here".
    -   Played for laughs in "Airport '07", where Peter mentions that he's so happy Quagmire got his job as a pilot back that he doesn't even mind that he got raped in federal prison, where he was sent for hijacking a plane.
    -   Subverted in "Fast Times At Buddy Cianci Jr. High", when Lois worries about Chris being sent to prison because she's seen _Oz_ and knows what goes on in prison showers. Cut to a scene of prisoners happily singing a parody of "The Wonderful Land of Oz" while soaping each others' backs in a completely chaste manner.
    -   After Meg gets back from prison she has apparently learnt all about prison rape and she calmly steps into the shower with her naked father, and rapes him with a loofah to assert her dominance.
    -   They did a gag about the "real" ending of _Dirty Dancing_ where Baby's parents sent Johnny to jail and he is lustfully licked by his cellmate while "Hungry Eyes" plays.
    -   It's also played straight in two parodies of _The Shawshank Redemption_:
        -   In the homage episode of Stephen King; in which appeared three Stephen King's stories acted by the characters.
        -   And in a cutaway gag parodying _The Shawshank Redemption_ with the Monopoly Man.
    -   Another gag had Mr. Magoo note he can't go to prison because they'll rape him and he won't see it coming.
    -   The idea is referenced in "Brian Wallows And Peters Swallows", as the bitter old lady Brian is sentenced to care for threatens to have him taken to jail, stating that he's 'one phone call away from getting a human booster shot from a guy named Molly'.
-   _Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids_: Implied as common during the Scare 'Em Straight tour of a prison in the 1984 episode "Busted". (Many of the inmates at the prison make graphic comments about wanting to get it on with the Fat Albert gang.) One shot actually showed a closeup of a cell with a big inmate gloating over a despairing tearful smaller inmate.
-   This was frequently implied to happen to the title character's father on the Canadian cartoon _Kevin Spencer_ during his frequent trips to the slammer.
-   _Legends of Chamberlain Heights_:
    -   Parodied in the season 2 finale when the three main characters end up in jail for armed robbery (they didn't do it, but confess anyway in the hopes of attracting women). After being transferred from juvie to regular prison, rape becomes a serious concern, and each character finds some way of fitting in; most notably, Jamal discovers that the gay clique in the prison _aren't_ gay, none of them are, they just act that way because if someone _wants_ gay sex, it's no challenge for the rapists. Jamal immediately joins their side and starts acting as Camp Gay as possible.
        
        **Rapist:** Now, who wants this dick?  
        **Jamal:** Me! Dicks dicks dicks dicks!  
        **Rapist:** Ew, fucking slut! _\[leaves\]_
        
    -   Also, during visiting hours, Grover's big brother Montrel tells him that if he does get raped and doesn't tell anyone about it, it never happened. He also assumes Grover called him over there because he DID get raped and now wants to marry his rapist.
-   In the _Looney Tunes_ short "Carrotblanca", at the end Yosemite Sam is thrown in jail and a dopey-looking prisoner suddenly gains a pair of eyelashes and smiles at him in a lustful way and Sam yells for help.
-   Implied to have happened to Doctor Rockso in _Metalocalypse_: a guard finds him shaking and huddling in his cellmate's sleeping arms.
-   _Oh Yeah! Cartoons_, of all things, references this in the short "Earth to Obie", when Obie's imagination sequence of being in jail for his cereal addiction at one point has an inmate heard calling Obie "sweet cheeks" and making kissy sounds.
-   _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_ has this implied to happen to Mojo more than once:
    -   He is looked at by an inmate with a creepy smile (implied sexually, although this is more a kind of double meaning) by the ending of "Cootie Gras". Not to mention the Narrator commenting, "Love is in the air, can you just smell it?"
    -   A similar scene happens to him in "Monkey See Doggy Two", only as Mojo is turned into a dog and sent to the pound, with another dog.
    -   The 10th anniversary/final episode special "The Powerpuff Girls Rule!" brings up this running gag one last time, as a fellow prisoner embraces Mojo much to Mojo's dismay.
-   _Rick and Morty_:
    -   Double Subverted in the episode "Meeseeks and Destroy". When Rick and Morty are being tried in giant court on murder charges, Rick mentioned that if somebody dropped the soap in giant prison that it'd land on their heads and crush their spines, and that it would be real easy to rape them after that.
    -   "A Rickle in Time" has this line: "You know what they do to third-dimensional lifeforms in Time Prison? Same thing they do in regular prison, only forever!"
-   A frequent topic on _Robot Chicken_.
-   In _Rocko's Modern Life_, Rocko's car is placed in impound. Rocko's car calls Rocko from the impound. Another car comes up behind Rocko's car. It then cuts to Rocko who hears prison rape noises (or at least, car suspension bouncing) over the phone. Then when Rocko goes down to bail out his car, the guard mentions that the other vehicles call him "Fancy Fenders."
    
    **Guard:** Term of endearment, I'm sure.
    
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   One odd variation is the occasional suggestion that a homosexual character would enjoy prison for this reason. For example, on one episode, there is a comment about Smithers "taking quickly" to a Turkish prison, and at the end of the remake of _The In-Laws_, one of the heroes comments that the flamboyant villain is going to "love" prison.
    -   Also hinted at in a throwaway joke in "The Bob Next Door", when Sideshow Bob tells Bart about how he stole his cellmate's identity (it wasn't pretty) to break out of prison: The cellmate asked Bob why he kept measuring his face with a caliper, to which Bob replied "Just passing the time." The cellmate then remarked "I guess it beats what the last guy did."
    -   In "Black Widower", when Krusty was working an awards show and Bob won the award, he sneered at Krusty (from a live feed from the prison), "This is one more than you'll ever win!" Krusty shot back, "Just don't drop that thing in the shower, Bob!"
    -   In their retelling of _The Count of Monte Cristo_, Homer is sent to prison and has Burns as his cellmate. Burns gives him an escape route and a map to his treasure. When Homer asks why Burns is helping him, he explains he wants to know he had at least one friend in his life and he also wants to make up for the fact that while Homer slept, Burns violated him repeatedly.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_:
    -   When SpongeBob tries to get Gary to take a bath (disguised as a treasure chest), he says that the soap is dubloons and tells him not to drop them (while winking).
    -   Implied at the end of "Patrick! The Game" to soon happen to Squidward when he's put in the back of a police truck with a burly prisoner.
-   Parodied in _The Venture Bros._ The Monarch wakes up in prison to find that he was about to be raped by King Gorilla (an actual gay gorilla). However, King admits he couldn't go through with it; Monarch reminds him too much of a girl. To make the scene even more bizarre, Monarch then realizes that he's not even in his own cell. Apparently, King Gorilla has enough pull with the guards to bring his "dates" over to his place.
