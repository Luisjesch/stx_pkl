Hugh Hefner knows how to accessorize.

You know him. The fabulously wealthy guy, who rubs shoulders with the rich and famous, the movers and shakers of industry, and may even have connections in the political arena. The one sitting on top of more capital than most people can imagine and more than they themselves will ever be able to spend in a lifetime. Add dashing good looks, boyish charm, swank tailored suits, lavish living in a downtown penthouse loft and a countryside mansion, a huge yacht, luxury cars, hanging out in VIP-only lounges in nightclubs, and weekend excursions on the Rio Grande or the Virgin Islands and it's no wonder they're regarded as part of the "jet set".

The combination of wealth, power, and charisma draws women to them _in droves_ — and he _exults_ in it, because he can have his pick among supermodels and starlets. Even if he's the type to love 'em and leave 'em, he knows there'll always be another to take their place, ensuring you'll never get as much action as he does. He is The Hedonist, so there may be a bevy of live-in girlfriends and mistresses.

The classic suit is the smoking jacket. Their luxury accessories aim to impress. If they light a cigarette, it's with an engraved platinum lighter. If they sign for a huge suite at a luxury hotel, it's with a silver Cartier fountain pen. They wear a Philippe Patek or Tag Heuer watch. For this reason, live action shows featuring playboys are great works for luxury Product Placement. When relaxing at home, silk pajamas and a robe are the favorite garb.

In addition to wealth and a glamorous personal style, playboys are cosmopolitan and well-read. They can discuss the novels of Norman Mailer, and Kurt Vonnegut, chat about Nietzche's philosophy or Picasso's painting style, favorite stagings of _La Bohème_, and debate political issues.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  The playboy has a well-rounded education, which allows them to be at ease conversing with everyone with from authors and artists to CEOs and heads of state.

Playboys are also gourmands with a refined palate. Their wine cellar and liquor cabinet includes rare, imported bottles. Their drink of choice is an elegant cocktail. Pipes and fine cigars are also appreciated.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Favorite playboy hobbies include gambling at elite casinos (Blackjack, roulette, etc); hanging out with business elite at wood-paneled private club; gala, black tie Classical Music events; art openings at fancy galleries; auction houses for fine art; posh equestrian events and other Snooty Sports; and luxury travel in their private jet to glamorous and exotic locations (French Riviera, Paris, Rome, tropical beaches).

In spy thrillers and heist films, they may be part of a Caper Crew. Usually as the one covering the group's expenses, and just as likely to use their connections to bail the team out of a tight spot, should it become necessary.

Ones with fighting skills are likely to be Cultured Badasses. For villainous examples see Man of Wealth and Taste.

Spear counterpart to the Socialite.

-   "The Most Interesting Man in the World" series of advertisements for Dos Equis beer centers around a yet-unnamed older gentleman who has no shortage of interesting tales about his life. He also appears to be quite wealthy and is always surrounded by beautiful women.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Roger Smith from the anime _The Big O_ is a heroic millionaire who protects people with his giant robot.
-   Ukyo from _Samurai 7_ could be seen as a variation of this, considering his extensive harem and insane amounts of wealth (the room all his harem girls gather in has a _whale in a tank_).
-   Ranmaru Mori from _The Wallflower_ fits this trope very well.
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul_, Tsukiyama's grandfather was apparently an infamous womanizer. His father worried he would turn out the same as a result of his School Idol status, but this turns out to be an unfounded concern.

-   Post-_Crisis_ Lex Luthor is a villainous example. Some writers have him actually _preferring_ that the women are only attracted to his money and influence. It's a turn-on for him that he's a turn-off for them.
-   _Green Arrow_
    -   Oliver Queen, before he gave away his fortune in the Seventies. The girls, the wining and dining and partying. Then he started dating Black Canary and founded a center for troubled youth.
    -   Averted on round two: After the events of "Quiver", when Stanley transferred all his considerable funds to Queen's name because he expected to take over his body, Green Arrow didn't go back to being a playboy; he wanted to try to patch things up with Black Canary, and he had a new sidekick to care for.

    -   Ultimate Tony Stark takes this to somewhat ridiculous degrees.

-   Porfirio Rubirosa had been one: five times married, former son in law of Rafael Trujillo, inverted the trope by becoming millionaire _because_ of his talent with ladies, had a brilliant career as a diplomat, was a great racing driver and airplane pilot. (Unfortunately for him, he died by crashing in a Ferrari.)
-   Actor George Clooney has a reputation for being one of these.
    
    **Kevin Smith:** See, George Clooney doesn't fucking give a shit \[if his movies bomb\]. He would just be like, "They didn't like it? Fuck it." (_mimicks getting head from a woman_). Or it'd be like (_counting stacks of bills_) "10 million!".
    
-   Donald Trump _used_ to have this reputation when the media documented his private life before he ran for office (married several times, dated pornstars, owned a beauty pageant), but proved to be such a unique character that he spawned an entirely new trope.
