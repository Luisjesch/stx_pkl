**Mike:** I can't keep burdening Lisa forever, but I do have a Happy Box and nice-bodied girls like Nan and Linda to keep me company, so I'm pretty happy in my own way. Nyahahahaha!  
**Linda:** I'm sorry, Mike, but that's called sexual harassment these days.  
**Mike:** This is a hard world we live in now. How disappointing.

Just what he sounds like — an older senior male character, usually unattractive in some way, who takes more than a passive delight in young women or girls, particularly those who are legally or/and objectively too young, ahem. Sometimes he limits himself to just talking dirty and propositioning cute girls, but sometimes he takes matters into his own hands. Literally. He's not The Casanova, nor is he necessarily trying to be — but he certainly won't complain if things work out that way for him.

The "old" part of his description is mostly relative to the girls he accosts — a creepy thirty-something teacher eyeing his junior high school students is no less a Dirty Old Man than a man at least twice as old as the former pinching the bottoms of housewives in the supermarket, though it's worth bearing out that a younger Dirty Old Man's behavior is going to be seen as a good deal _less_ harmless than that of his hoary-headed counterparts. Probably because a Dirty _Old_ Man is supposedly less likely to chase his victims, or force worse things upon them. There's also the fact that regardless of the man's age, it's almost invariably considered less harmful for him to turn his attention to fully-matured women, as opposed to girls who are still developing. Of course, since some men start looking semi-elderly as early as their late twenties, for all practical purposes, this trope covers a wide latitude.

When played for comedy he is either a disgusting pervert who gets beaten up by the girls he assaults or a delightful rogue whom the girls tolerate. When played seriously, he's usually some variety of sexual predator or mistaken as such.

The character's personality will usually be at least a little sympathetic, with him as either an amusing clown character or a Mr. Vice Guy. Of course, if he crosses the line into predatory behavior, all bets are off.

In Britain, these characters are typically seen wearing brown mackintosh coats, which allow concealment of a certain activity, leading to them being referred to as "the dirty mac brigade." In the U.S., it has long been popular to depict this fellow traipsing around in a Conspicuous Trenchcoat (often with the innuendo that he's wearing _nothing but_ the coat).

For an anime variant that is somewhat less old, see Lovable Sex Maniac. Played sympathetically, this character is likely to fall under Chivalrous Pervert, and this is likely to be established early on to show that while he may be looking at them longingly, he has standards and will follow them religiously.

Dirty Old Woman is the female equivalent of this trope. If the work means to portray the older man-younger woman dynamic in a more sympathetic or even romantic light, it isn't this trope, but May–December Romance.

If you were confused, you may have been looking for The Pig-Pen.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Sensei Touga of _12 Beast_. He gets _very_ excited upon catching the "scent of a woman," has a ninja "dummy" that would not look out of place in an H-game, and uses his grandson's PSP to play a visual novel—in which he is trying to achieve the "Harem" ending.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_ features Heaven Canceler, one of the most powerful men in Academy City, a doctor with surgical skills _better_ than most supernatural equivalents. It seems like he originally became a doctor to pick up chicks.
    
    **Heaven Canceler:** You've been hospitalized twice in the past ten days. Don't tell me you have a nurse fetish?  
    **Touma:** What are you talking about? Would I slice off my hand just for that?  
    **Heaven Canceler:** Oh. I thought I'd found a compatriot.
    
-   Kimura-sensei in _Azumanga Daioh_ freely admits that the main reason he became a teacher is _"Because I like high school girls, that's why!"_ Even though he already has a ridiculously cute waifu and daughter.
-   Depraved Homosexual Earl Trancy from _Black Butler II_. The same can be said for Baron Kelvin from _Book of Circus_ who had become obsessed with Ciel since he was _eight_.
-   _Bleach_. Shunsui Kyoraku is a decent sort, but to add to squick there is a massive age difference between him and Nanao, for whom he is frequently this trope. It would arguably be squicky even if they were the ages they appear. Made even worse by the fact that Kyoraku is in fact her paternal uncle.
-   Dr. McLaren from episode 7 of the _Bubblegum Crisis_ OVA comes to Japan partly to work on a new Boomer design and partly to meet "geisha girls" and hookers. This became a big part of a plot to kidnap him.
-   In the 9th _Dirty Pair_ OVA, we have Mazoho. An elderly arms dealer who also brainwashes people into super-soldiers, he also likes to grab Yuri and Kei's butts, and they catch him attempting to touch their breasts a few times.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
-   Makarov from _Fairy Tail_ takes full advantage of the Power Perversion Potential that comes with having extendable arms.
-   Headmaster Osmond from _The Familiar of Zero_, who enjoys using his mouse Familiar to look up his secretary's skirt... and then commenting on her choice of panties... On the pain of getting his ass kicked by her. He also uses a flying, magic-controlled hand to grope her... and get's this hand back in the face by her.

-   Iron Klaus's boss in _From Eroica with Love_ is way too interested in Klaus's subordinate G
-   Subverted in _Fullmetal Alchemist_. Hohenheim is called this by the other characters after he says he'd rather group up with Lan Fan alone to monopolize her attention. In actuality, he intends to let her leave to go find Prince Ling while he fights the Big Bad alone.
    -   Played Straight with Lieutenant General Grumman. In Rebecca's introductory scene, he spanks her while she is on the sharpshooting range, much to her consternation.
-   In _Gate_, Kato is a wise and respected wizard and teacher, but he also ogles the girls in his language class and tells his magic student Lelei that he's not interested in her because she's a child and he would prefer her grown-up, curvaceous sister.
-   Most of the male teachers in _Great Teacher Onizuka_. Well, basically almost any male who may qualify as old. It says something that Onizuka, in all his lecherous behaviour, is _mild_ in comparison.
-   In _Happy Yarou Wedding_, Yuuhi suspects Todou is going to rape him when he first brings him to his house. His prediction turns out to be completely wrong but Yuuhi still considers him a Dirty Old Man anyways, if more affectionately.
-   _Heaven's Lost Property_: Tomoki Sakurai's grandfather Tomozo was a really perverted guy and taught his daughter Tomoyo (Tomoki's mother) and Tomoki to be perverts like him. Tomozo said his dream was to sleep with EVERY woman in the world and regretted failing this mission when he died.

-   _Horimiya_: Virtually every student in Katagiri High School knows that Yasuda, class 3-1's English teacher, is a pervert who doesn't bother trying to hide the fact that he lusts after the female students. A lot of characters often wonder how the hell he became a teacher and why he hasn't been fired yet, and his own class's respect for him is practically non-existent.
-   Master of Chinese Kenpo, Ma Kensei from _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_, is a shameless pervert. Among other things, he was introduced trying to secretly take dirty pictures of Shigure and deftly dodging the shuriken she threw in response.
-   Claw from _Kimba the White Lion_. The first time he meets Kitty, a _child_, Claw asked her to be his "queen" when she becomes a little older.
-   In _Kotoura-san_, Haruka's grandfather seems to be much of a pervert as Manabe is, as evidenced by him making her sit on his lap, then bragging about it later to her friends.
-   Daisensei (a.k.a. Guru Lou) in _Kyatto Ninden Teyandee_ (AKA _Samurai Pizza Cats_). His lecherous attitude was toned down in the SPC version.
-   _Lilim Kiss_ has a high school boy being found by his mother with the titular Lilim (really a succubus) covered only by a towel. When she sits them down with her husband, the man's first scenes have him staring right at Lilim's chest. His wife and son are not amused.
-   _Lucky Star_:
    -   Soujiro Izumi. When asked if he was a Lolicon, he protests the label, saying, "I like normal girls as well, so I am _also_ a Lolicon".
    -   His daughter Konata, eighteen years old (and looks even younger), is often referred as one by Kagami even though she's neither old nor male; it's largely due to her tendency to make dirty jokes about the other girls.
-   _Maken-ki!_: Unlike most examples, Ouken Yamato isn't content to just look, or cop a feel. He has his own harem of concubines ranging from their late teens - early 20s and he's shagging **ALL** of 'em. The old guy even perved on Minori, who's his mortal enemy, once he had her beat.
    
    **Minori: (gritting teeth)** "GNH! You stupid, perverted old man!"
    
-   Goei Harukawa is creepy enough in _Moonlight Lady_. The fact that he gratuitously spanks Suzuna after finding her in bed with a maid, scouts the villages for women for Kouichi, watches Kouichi enjoy those women, or even watches his own _niece_ get gangbanged makes him a dirty old man if there ever was one.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   The Third Hokage. Even Jiraiya (the self-proclaimed "super pervert") is peeved when he finds out.
        
        "Sarutobi\-sensei, you're a perv!"
        
    -   Orochimaru also counts, seeing of how he seems to like to stroke children's faces, his obsession with Uchiha's Sharingan like Itachi or Sasuke, or even calling the latter 'beautiful' who is 16 years old for Pete's sake!
    -   Jiraiya often spies on women bathing, even if they are teens, plus he writes some pretty naughty books.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_:
    -   Albert Chamomile who, being a short-lived ermine, is an old man despite being _younger_ than _the ten-year-old main character_, let alone the 14-year-old girls who make up most of the rest of the cast. Also, _is a dirty old man despite being an ermine_. Both he and the author's notes refer to him as a dirty old man several times.
        -   Chamo is an "ermine spirit," whatever that means, so it's quite possible that he's going to live much longer than normally expected.
    -   Jack Rakan also seems to fall into this on occasion. He greeted Asuna by poking her chest, and (on several occasions) won fights by stealing the panties off his opponents.
-   One of the few examples in _One Piece_ is Brook, a _post-mortem_ dirty old man at (technically) age 88. If you are a woman, chances are he will shamelessly but politely ask you to show him your panties.
-   Ashure in _Pochi Kuro_. He used to be an attractive-looking vampire who is one of the only people in the underworld to live with a human, in the form of his lover Cynthia. However 150 years later, and after the passing of Cynthia, he's become a perverted geezer who exhibits constant lecherous behavior towards Pochi (peeking up her skirt and even burrowing his head into her chest) resulting in Kuro's fury. He even mentions Pochi having bigger breasts than his deceased lover, Cynthia.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   From the original series, Moe in the controversial 18th episode "Beauty and The Beach" appears to be attracted to Misty and stares at her breasts. In the original Japanese version, the old man says that he will be looking forward to having fun with her in a few years, whereas in the English version, he tells her that she reminds him of his granddaughter.
    -   From _Black & White_, Alder, Champion of the Unova League, is currently looking like an older version of Brock, flirting with both Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny as well as the Sinnoh Champion Cynthia. They all ignore that and focus on the fact that the Champion is right in front of them. Only Iris and Trip are disturbed by his behavior.
-   Professor Cat in _Princess Tutu_ is a more chaste version of this trope. He doesn't appear to have any intentions of doing anything sexual to his students... but he threatens to force them to marry him if they slack off in their practice. He seems particularly intent on the main heroine, who is somewhere in the 12-14 range.
-   _Prison School_ has the Chairman, who despite his stoic demeanor has a serious ass fetish that he hides very poorly, often to the frustration of his daughter Mari. When forced to bury his Porn Stash in cement, he quietly sheds a tear for his collection of Brazilian babes.
-   Happosai in _Ranma ½_, Panty Thief and groping, voyeuristic, sexual harasser, is the paradigm of dirty old men in anime. His perversion also gives him his power. He was so perverted that he actually chased away a ghost because he wouldn't stop harassing her.
-   Touhou Fuhai from _Rosario + Vampire_, combined with being an otaku, and he is obsessed with 2D girls because they last forever and would never betray him. That doesn't stop him from making Moka cosplay as Lum.
-   _Sailor Moon_: Rei Hino's unnamed grandfather is a total pervert who constantly harasses girls, to the point where a magazine article was printed warning the neighborhood about him.
-   Tenchi's father Noboyuki is a walking example of this trope, even hitting on Ryoko while under the impression that she's Tenchi's fiancée. In the OVAs, Tenchi's grandfather Katshuhito has elements of this as well. Although the two are distantly related, one can't exactly say it runs in the family (Tenchi missed out on it altogether).
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ has two: Lord Genome who "created little dolls" to "play with" as a hobby, including his, ahem, _daughter_ Nia. then seals them up in coffins and leaves them to die in a landfill when he gets bored. And then there is his armadillo sidekick Guane who goes Pedobear on Nia (poor girl!) at one point, feeling her up and propositioning her for sex in exchange for her life. Three if you count the Anti-Spiral King who tried to _rape_ Nia at one point. It sucks to be a cute prepubescent girl in a world where apparently everyone got really skeevy because of the apocalypse...
-   _Time Stop Hero_: King Nazar Rope II is an elderly man who passed a law saying all women in his kingdom (with a few exceptions like shamans) must always wear swimsuits in public. He makes it clear this is for lecherous purposes.
-   The Principal in _To Love Ru_. Despite being the highest authority in the school, he is well-known by the students for being a big pervert. There are even signs in the school warning about him (done by the student council). He even allowed Lala, her sisters, and other aliens to study in the school just to increase the number of cute girls in the school.
-   _Variable Geo_: The unnamed Old Master is a lecher and wasn't ashamed to admit it, while watching Jun strip, after her loss to Yuka. When Yuka tries to deck him for it, he casually dodges her punch and responds by nuzzling her chest. Then walks away laughing that she wasn't "half-bad". Whether he was referring to the punch or her breasts is left unclear.
-   Olin from the _Violinist of Hameln_, in an odd twist, he's dirty around young men and hits on Hamel and Clari multiple times.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   Ol' Sugoroku Mutou is one; at least, in the original version, anyway. Two or three bits of his lechery made it into the dub, though. Particularly his fascination with Vivian Wong.
    -   It was edited out in the dub, but this was also the case with Shuzo Otaki, one of the Big 5 (named Crump in the dub), and with _him_, it was obvious. He was clearly a pervert, so much so that his intended target of Grand Theft Me was Anzu for this _very_ demented reason. (He made some rather sexist comments towards Anzu _and_ Dark Magician Girl too; DMG's reaction in the original version was very unsubtle.)
    -   Daimen (Hobson in American version) might have been one. In the manga (only) he tried to make Yugi and his friends scream during the second part of the Death-T arc (to trigger a trap that would electrocute them if they did), using a device with mechanized hands, which, among other things, fondled Tea's breasts. (He didn't get away with this; the two-year-old Honda was babysitting actually defecated in his lap, causing _him_ to scream and fall victim to his own device.)

    Comedy 

-   Jim Backus' "Dirty Old Man." Every line in his dialogue, where he's whiling away an evening making obscene phone calls to random women, has bleeped words.
-   Hudson & Landry's "Obscene Phone Bust" takes place in a police station where an obscene phone caller is being read the riot act:
    
    **Officer:** Well, the department's gonna see to it that you don't call no more women and use words like (_SFX: boing sound_) and (_SFX: train whistle_) and (_SFX: door closing_) and I can't even read _this_ one.  
    **George:** That's (_SFX: two gun shots_), flatfoot!
    

    Comic Books 

-   As many _Batman_ fans could tell you, The Penguin can drift into this territory in his various incarnations.
    -   Burgess Meredith's depiction on the 1960s TV show was first out of the gate. In his 1994 autobiography, Adam West (who played Batman) noted that, even when the cameras weren't on, Meredith stayed in character and "cackled and muttered to himself... seemed to be searching for a behind to pinch." He also once told West: "What could be better than to have women smile at you and little kids shy away from you? It's the best of both worlds." (Yes, he really did say "both worlds.")
    -   Danny DeVito's portrayal of the Penguin in _Batman Returns_. He fondles a girl's breasts as he's pinning a button to her coat, rudely stares at a voluptuous woman's posterior for an excessive amount of time, sniffs Catwoman's spiked heel, and agrees to run for mayor only after learning that being mayor in Gotham City entitles one to "unlimited poontang."
    -   Even the original comic book, Penguin has gotten into the act a bit. In the 1990s, he stopped wearing his top hat (at least for a time) and made the transition to a Villain with Good Publicity, opening an Arctic-themed nightclub/casino called the Iceberg Lounge. Within this club he was regularly seen in the company of one young woman or another, each one just as dispensable as the next, who never did much of anything or even spoke, but were just there to make the Penguin look good; one comic cover had the Penguin posed like a _Bond_ villain, surrounded by numerous of these scantily-clad females, all of them of different races. This carried over to the animated series, where the Penguin actually staffed his club exclusively with women and dressed them in a manner reminiscent of the _Playboy_ Bunnies.
-   In the older _Beetle Bailey_ strips, General Halftrack came across as one, often making suggestive comments about (and occasionally towards) Ms. Buxley. In more modern strips, where this sort of thing was not publicly tolerated, he started taking sensitivity classes and eventually stopped.
-   Superman:
    -   The Man of Steel's archenemy Lex Luthor was initially this post-_Crisis on Infinite Earths_. It was established in the second issue of the _World of Metropolis_ miniseries that after a teenaged Lois Lane broke into Lexcorp, he had her strip-searched and keeps the footage of it.
    -   Morgan Edge's father Vincent Edge had a habit of making saucy remarks towards younger women.
-   In issue 239 of _G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (IDW)_, then-17-year-old Dawn Moreno is hit on by a perverted old man. Dawn retaliates by tying him up and locking him in the trunk of his car. The man is found with duct tape on his mouth and the word "perv" written on his forehead.
-   The Brazilian comic _Holy Avenger_ has Talude, Maximum Master of magic. While demonstrating the art of (weak) enchantments, he tries to make a girl take off her clothes.
-   Deathstroke the Terminator from _Teen Titans_. Especially during The Judas Contract arc, where he was implied to have slept with the underage Terra.
-   _Urbanus_: Jef Patat is a filthy, obese middle-aged scoundrel who lives under a bridge and has a huge collection of dirty magazines and porn videos.
-   Belgian comic _Violine_, about a 10-year-old girl who can read people's minds by staring into their eyes, has an encounter with one of these that appears to be played partially straight and partially for dark humor. Violine escapes from her school where she was accused of being a witch and finds a random man driving by who offers her a ride. The man takes her away from the direction she told him she lived, however, and she gets suspicious. Staring into his eyes to read his mind, Violine sees an image of herself bound and gagged and looking up with pleading eyes while lying on a pillow. Angered and scared, she attempts to escape and crash his car.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   In the main 616 continuity, Professor X was revealed in about the 3rd or 4th issue (from the '60s) to be in love with Jean (it gets worse as a retcon revealed he had helped her with her powers since she was 12), although it was actually something of a throwaway joke about ALL the X-Men being in love with her. That particular plot point was dropped and forgotten about until the Onslaught saga when Jean was taken on a trip through Xavier's mind where she was exposed to that particular memory, freaking her out to no end.
    -   Wolverine also has a tendency to have semi-flirtatious relationships with girls a lot younger than even his apparent, never mind actual, age. Shadowcat, Jubilee, Rogue.
    -   _Ultimate X-Men_: Xavier was quite The Casanova in the past, and had several love relations that ended on bad terms, such as Moira, Emma Frost, and Mystique. Defied Trope in the case of Jean Grey, as he secretly likes her but realizes that's wrong and does not do anything about it. Wolverine had the classic Love Triangle with Jean Grey and Cyclops, although they are teenagers in this continuity and he isn't.
    -   While it's never been made clear if the Shadow King is an old mutant or an Ancient Evil, he does go out of his way to pursue women like Storm, Rogue, and Psylocke as "Shadow Queens."
-   Julia's Master Leep in _Gold Digger_. Later, after his Heroic Sacrifice, it was revealed that it was just an affectation he kept up to keep his female students turned off after several of them fell in love with him and an all-out Melee that nearly got another student killed erupted when they all tried to confess their feelings at the same time.

    Fan Works 

-   _Avengers: Darkness in Kingdom Hearts_ takes Frollo's lust for Esmerelda a step further when he also becomes "interested" in Wanda Maximoff; with Wanda and Peter Parker acting as guardians for Sora (_Kingdom Hearts_), at various points they ask other characters to cover Sora's ears so he won't have to hear about Frollo lusting after the woman who is currently acting as Sora's maternal figure.

-   _Children of Time_: Professor Moriarty, of all people, in the twelfth episode. He has shown a measure of respect for eighteen-year-old Beth Lestrade, but, in a disturbing bargain for the lives of the heroes, he allows her to become his Sex Slave in all but name. When the heroes arrive to rescue Beth, Moriarty is fondling and petting her, presumably to hurt _Holmes_, but still... In the next season, his clone turns out to be something of a Stalker with a Crush towards the now-mid-20s Beth.
-   _Chlorine Grown Roses_: Azusa's maids are forced to wear skimpy French maid outfits around her mansion because "papa liked that kind of stuff o.o".
-   _Code: Half Demon_: Odd, who thought it was a horror movie, accidentally watched a movie about one and ended up disgusting Ulrich, but it was only mentioned.
-   _Destiny Intertwined_: General Tordner is noted for his "taste" for much younger dragonesses, and particularly for his habit of exclusively using young, pretty female soldiers as squires. Both his adult children and his ex-wife find this habit disgusting.
-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_ takes Master Roshi's canonical depravity and ratchets it up further, culminating in this exchange when Bulma comes over to show off baby Trunks.
    
    **Turtle**: He is legally obligated to inform you that he is—  
    **Master Roshi**: Turtle, _I've watched her poop_! She knows what I'm about.
    
-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_: In Communication Restored: Grandpa Hino is shown as one when we get a look into his head when he thought about keeping an eye on what his teenage granddaughter and her friends were up to:
    
    He wouldn't confront Rei just yet, but he would keep a closer eye on the group. A grin appeared on his wrinkly face. He had no problem with that since they were all easy on the eyes.
    
-   A good amount of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ Shipping fics feature Discord <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  as this — typically toward either Princess Celestia <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  or Fluttershy.
-   Played for Drama in _The Night Unfurls_:
    -   Beasley is an old man who wants to "do as much as he pleases" to Alicia. This Villainous Crush is a reason why he becomes a mole for Vault and the Black Dogs, joining their cause to build a Sex Empire.
    -   Sinister Minister Grishom thinks that should he bring Sir Kyril's head to Vault, he would be rewarded with plenty of women. The narration describes his face as filled with "bravado and lust."
-   This does get deconstructed in _No Chance for Fate_. In canon, Happosai was played almost entirely for comedy. Taking away all the comedy reveals what kind of person would develop such a mindset - a very nasty one.
-   Phil, the Capricorn Pirates' gunner, in _One Piece: Parallel Works_.
-   Since near everyone in _Ranma ½ Abridged_ is depraved, any character sufficiently old enough would come under this, but Sōun Tendō gets special mention. He is very fond of finding himself in situations embracing the girl version of Ranma.
    
    **Sōun:** I feel _so_ shōtacon right now.
    
-   _Ranma Saotome, Chi Master_ has a darker example in Qiáng Wang. He's known to "help himself" to other people's bodies, male or female, whether they consent or not. It's mentioned that even Happosai found his "predilections" disgusting.
-   Qrow in _Ruby and Nora_ is even more a perv than canon.
-   In _RWBY: Scars_, Weiss gets hit on by Maximus, a man old enough to be her father, at a charity drive. To make it even more distasteful, this is only a few weeks at most after his son Cardin's funeral (and his son was also attracted to Weiss). Weiss' mother saves her from more of Maximus' uncomfortable affection.
-   SCP-106 in _SCP – Containment Breach_ is a horrific version of this, especially when he comments on how the Player Character hair smells nice.
-   _Sixes and Sevens_: When Michael Carter and Roger Aubrey infiltrate the mansion of Hugh Jones, they note that he has a very young taste in women. Roger compares Jones' Malibu estate to Louis XV's infamous Parc-aux-Cerf due to how many young women and underaged girls are seen hanging around.
-   _Vapors_: Jiraiya turns out to be Not So Shameless when it comes to Aiko. He is physically uncomfortable with seeing her naked or immodestly dressed, practically flinching away from her bare chest when he needs to examine a seal there.
-   In _The Loud House_ fanfic _What You Wish For_, every man in the country club is said to have his eye on Carol, even though Carol is seventeen and most of the country club members are elderly.
-   Multiple characters in _With Pearl and Ruby Glowing_, but a particularly tragic variation is Simon Petrikov, a.k.a. the Ice King, who here is suffering from Alzheimer's and incapable of realising his nurse is not actually his late wife.
-   _Yet again, with a little extra help_: The vast majority of middle-aged to old men are perverts. This includes Ghost, the Third Hokage, Jiraiya, Hiashi, the Third Tsuchikage, and Roshi.
-   LittleKuriboh's _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_:
    -   Yugi's grandpa, Solomon Muto. He's rather pervy (groping Tea), and then there's his "relationship" with the Black Luster Soldier.
        
        **Grandpa:** Please stop! I thought you were my grandson.  
        **Tea:** Is that why you were trying to grope me?  
        **Grandpa:** If I said "yes", would it make this situation any less awkward?
        
        **Grandpa:** _\[while stroking poster\]_ Oh Black Luster Soldier, no one must know of our forbidden love.
        
    -   Naturally, Crump is also made worse, constantly making disgusting slurping sounds among other things.

    Films — Animation 

-   Jafar in _Aladdin_ comes across as this when he wants Genie to make Jasmine fall in love with him, and when he thinks that's happened, he calls her "pussycat". Um, _gross_.
-   Phil from _Hercules_ likes to spy on nymphs. They... don't appreciate the attention.
-   Judge Claude Frollo from _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ is another villainous Dirty Old Man with a serious lust for the romantic lead, Esmeralda, who he tries to have burned at the stake when she rejects his advances. (And, being the hypocritical coward that he is, Frollo insists that his perversion is all _Esmeralda's fault_.)
-   _Sausage Party_: Gum has some female Gum Strips lap dance for him during the orgy scene, though of course nobody else at the supermarket was a virgin either.
    
    **Gum:** Say my name. It's "Sorbitol, Malitol, Xylitol"...
    
-   In _Toy Story 2_, Stinky Pete is seen flirting with some Barbies during the end-credits Hilarious Outtakes.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The Ephors in _300_ are a group of disgusting and putrid elders that always demand the most beautiful Spartan girls to live as oracles with them "for they have the needs of men and souls black as Hell". In fact, they side with the Persians when they are promised gold and a daily supply of girls from every corner of the empire.
-   In _An Autumn Afternoon_, Horie is accused of being one by his friends for having a wife young enough to be his daughter.
-   _Bad Grandpa_ Irving Zisman is a dirty old bastard. His first action after his wife dies is to head for the nearest Oriental Massage parlor.
-   The marquis in _The Baker's Wife_ lives with his four, uh... "nieces". The vicar in particular disapproves.
-   _Batman (1989)_ gives us gangster Carl Grissom, who looks like he's in his seventies - and is in a relationship with Alicia Hunt, who cannot be any older than 30 or so. It's never made clear whether Carl and Alicia are... uh, "active", but it's not likely given that Jack Napier calls him "a tired old man."
-   _Beetlejuice_ exhibits every quality required, being a disgusting pervert of a dead guy, with truly appalling hygiene, who is several hundred years old. Among other things, he grabs a woman's boobs, peeks up Mrs. Maitlaind's dress (as well as Mrs. Deetz's), and nearly succeeds in marrying teenage girl Lydia Deetz- against her will.
-   _Borat Subsequent Moviefilm_: The film catches former New York mayor Rudy Guiliani on hidden camera reaching his hand down his trousers in front of a teenage Blonde Republican Sex Kitten (in reality it's 24-yo Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova). At best, he was just tucking his shirt in; at worst, he was masturbating in front of her to try and seduce her.
-   Merrick Jamison-Smythe of the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ film is several centuries old and is called a "skanky old man" by no less a personage than Buffy herself. He isn't, but out of context, it would certainly look that way. He shadows teenage girls throughout a mall (he's trying to determine which one is the Slayer), he creepily knows about a mole Buffy had removed some years before, he walks into the locker room while Buffy is about to change... and, in a scene that would definitely raise suspicions if it happened in real life, he enters the school gymnasium during a basketball game and sits down by himself, in a Conspicuous Trenchcoat, to watch dozens of scantily-clad basketball players and cheerleaders (though this turns out to be justified, as vampires have infiltrated the game).
-   Lord Cruikshank in _Clegg_, whose major hobby is ogling beautiful women. Proves to be his undoing when Suzy the Slag lures him back to his hotel room and murders him.
-   The _Crank_ series has Doc Miles and Poon Dong (who is _100_).
-   Wooderson in _Dazed and Confused_.

-   Pops in _Dirty Work_. Enjoys lustfully watching exercise tapes. Possesses a photograph of Mitch's mom having sex with him. Pops shows it to Mitch.
-   _Doctor at Sea_ has Harry, one of the men working on the SS _Lotus_. When the ship docks in Bellos, he immediately tries chasing after a young local.
-   Patches O'Houlihan from _DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story_
    
    **Patches:** I got a couple'a hookers in my room, queerbag.
    
-   In _Faster_, one of Driver's targets, Old Guy, is an elderly serial rapist and serial killer.
-   _Feeding Frenzy_: The elderly and crippled Mr. Plinkett is introduced as a john for a much younger prostitute. He demands that she prove herself by licking his cane suggestively while he mutters creepy comments.
-   _The Firemen's Ball_: All the crusty old firemen, who goggle at the girls in the beauty pageant. When one of the prettier girls says she brought her swimsuit, then proceeds to take off her dress and show it, the gross old firemen tell her to pose and then wish that they'd had the other girls bring swimsuits. One angry father shows up and yanks his daughter out of the "pageant", saying "I'll show you a beauty queen, you dirty geezers!"
-   _The General's Daughter_: Colonel Moore is shown to be a rather sleazy sort, having engaged in hardcore bondage sessions with his "student" Elizabeth Campbell.
-   _Grumpy Old Men_. Grandpa Gustafson had more Unusual Euphemisms for sex than your average Fark.com thread. In other words, when it comes to women and for an old man, he has an abnormally perverted obsession with sex, even revealed clearly just by his kinky remarks.
    -   The outtakes during the credits roll highlight this, with his using fictional Hawaiian islands as a means of seduction (e.g. "Imakindakinky").
-   _The Hairy Bird_: At an all-girls school, a male teacher is so creepy towards his female students that his lechery has become an in-joke amongst the girls.
-   Reverse Lampshaded in _A Hard Day's Night_, where the first comment about Paul's grandfather was "Very Clean Old Man". It was a Running Gag throughout the film that everyone kept commenting on how clean he was. This doubles as Actor Allusion as he was played by the same actor who portrayed Steptoe (see below).
-   Grandpa Hoover in _Little Miss Sunshine_ is the quintessential Dirty Old Man.
    
    **Grandpa:** Are you gettin' any?  
    **Richard:** Dad!  
    **Grandpa:** You can tell me, Dwayne. Are you gettin' any?  
    **Richard:** Come on, please.  
    **Grandpa:** _(Dwayne shakes his head)_ No? Jesus. You're what? Fifteen? My God, man!  
    **Richard:** Dad!  
    **Grandpa:** You should be gettin' that young stuff.  
    **Richard:** Dad!  
    **Grandpa:** That young stuff is the best stuff in the whole world.  
    **Richard:** Hey! Hey! Dad! That's enough! Stop it!  
    **Grandpa:** Will you kindly not interrupt me, Richard! See, right now you're jailbait, they're jailbait. It's perfect. I mean, you hit 18, man! You're talkin' about three to five.

Yet when he's not trying to kill her, he kisses her and attempted to rape her.

-   _Prime Cut_: Devlin comes across as this when he buys teen hooker Poppy sexy dresses but no underwear.
-   The Professor in _Seven (1979)_. He travels with an inflatable sex doll and hits on every attractive woman he meets. He is enough of a Loveable Rogue, however, that he seems to have a reasonable success rate as a pickup artist.
-   Said about Mean Mr Mustard in _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_. As the Fembots sing his song Mustard first says accusingly "A DIRTY OLD MAN?" then proudly "Yesssss! A Dirrrty Old Mannnnnn!"
-   _Shivers (1975)_: Dr. Hobbes was basically just an old pervert who decided that the world needed to be turned into a mindless orgy. Thus the lust-spreading parasites were born.
-   The Mexican who picks up Diana when she is hitchhiking in _Sisters of Death_. He tries to feel her up but laughs good-naturedly when she rebuffs his advances.

-   Elmer Stover, the producer who talks Angela into being photographed naked in _Snapshot (1979)_.
-   Jerry in _Space Cowboys_ is an unrepentant—and for his age, pretty successful—womanizer.
-   Judge Turpin of _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_ is an evil example of a Dirty Old Man played very seriously. Not only does he rape the title character's wife at a masked ball after having her husband "transported for life", but he also has a creepy Wife Husbandry plan for Sweeney's daughter Johanna, which doesn't work because Johanna hates him and has eyes for young sailor Anthony Hope.
-   The creepy old guy in the car at the conclusion of _Teeth_.
-   _True Lies_: Gibson, Harry’s fellow spy, makes some crass comments to Harry about Harry’s fourteen-year-old DAUGHTER.

    **Albert Gibson:** She's fourteen, Harry.
    
    **Harry Tasker:** She's fourteen-years-old!
    
    **Albert Gibson:** She's fourteen, and her little hormones are going off like a car alarm.

    Jokes 

-   An elderly man in Florida had owned a large farm for years. He had a large pond in the back, fixed up nice; picnic tables, horseshoe courts, and some orange and peach trees. The pond was ideal for swimming, although he rarely did that anymore. One evening he decided to go down to the pond, as he hadn't been there for a while, and look it over. He grabbed a five-gallon bucket with which to bring back some fruit. As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee. As he came closer he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond. He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end. One of the women shouted to him, "We're not coming out until you leave!" The old man frowned, "I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or to make you get out of the pond naked..." holding the bucket up he said, "...I'm here to feed the alligator."
-   An old man enters the confessional. "Father, I have sinned... For my sixty-second birthday, I went to a bar where I picked up two young women and had sex with both of them three times over the next day." "I _see_. How long has it been since you confessed yourself?" "This is my first time, I've been an atheist all my life." "What? But... Why are you telling me this?" "Are you kidding? I'm telling _everybody!!!_"
-   An old man is telling this: "An attractive young woman asked me once, 'What do you prefer: breasts or legs?' I told her what I really liked was a well-shaved snatch. Apparently, I am no longer welcome in any KFC establishment from now on."

    Literature 

-   General Thiébault devotes about five pages of his _Mémoires_ to an old knight of Saint-Louis who pinched the ladies' bottoms in the Tuileries garden. Even when they were obviously not alone.
-   _1066 and All That_ describes Oscar Wilde as "the leader of a set of disgusting old gentlemen called 'the naughty nineties.'" For all his memorable artistic contributions, he "behaved rather beardsley."
-   In _Acid Row_, 71-year-old Franek is an especially dark example. When he takes Sophie - who is several decades his junior - hostage, he gropes her chest and rubs his erection against her, and otherwise leers at her and makes creepy comments. Sophie strongly fears that he will try to rape her and he indeed attempts to do so after catching her off-guard, viciously beating her when she resists.
-   In _American Gods_ Mr. Wednesday looks old, has looked old for at least thirty years, and regularly beds women who are barely legal.
-   In Neil Gaiman's _Anansi Boys_, the eponymous Trickster God Anansi is not only this but uses his last strength to expose a young woman's breasts.
-   In _The Anderssons_ series by Solveig Olsson-Hultgren, Anna (who is fourteen years old) in _"Det fjärde rummet"_ is assaulted by a married man, who only lets her go when she threatens to tell his wife.
-   _Bazil Broketail_: Gadjung is _very_ old and when he arrived to Port Tarquil (shortly after his run-in with the Argonathi fleet led to the destruction of his island fortress in book four), he demands a tribute in form of _eight virgins every year_. When the citizens expectedly refused, he casts a curse on them and refused to lift it until his demands are met. After arriving to Monjon, he takes part in a magical competition in order to marry princess Serena and when he wins, he graphically describes their future sex life to her, both to creep her out and to express his lust.
-   In Fyodor Dostoevsky's short story "Bobok", the aging general is still lusting after girls barely of age even when he's in his grave.
-   I-Gos from _Chessmen Of Mars_ is a creepy old taxidermist who likes to reminisce about his past as a ladies' man and tries to hit on Princess Tara. However, he later turns out to have an honorable side, when he aids Gahan in his efforts to rescue Tara because he doesn't like the cowardly manner in which the Jeddak is trying to woo her.
-   _Discworld_
    -   Wizards on the Discworld are supposed to be celibate, but this doesn't stop much of the faculty of Unseen University from ogling beautiful young women when they think they can get away with it (for example, when peeking on the activities of Bibulous, God of Wine, in _Hogfather_, they suddenly get a whole lot more interested when they learn he's surrounded by naked maidens).
    -   Windle Poons — as seen in _Moving Pictures_ — was one of the worst of the lot, despite being about a hundred and thirty and wheelchair-bound.
    -   Professor Flead from _Making Money_ is a ghost who ends up helping only because he was promised that he would be taken to a place where women "show off their... ankles?"
    -   Another _Discworld_ example is Cohen the Barbarian and his Silver Horde. They're too old to go around ravishing maidens, though, so they have to make do with leering at them instead. Like most other things, the Silver Horde (and Cohen in particular) is _very good_ at this as a result of their years of experience. One character asks if they are the ones who go around raping young women, and another replies thoughtfully, "No. _Ravishing_, perhaps. I don't think there have been any actual _complaints_."
-   The main character of _El espejo de Lida sal_ by Miguel Ángel Asturias asks for romantic advice from a blind old man that fits squarely on this trope, being that he gropes her a couple of times.
-   _The Han Solo Trilogy_:
    -   Ganar Tos, Teroenza's servant, is an elderly Zisian who is smitten with Bria. He then arranges to have Teroenza marry them, never asking whether Bria wants this or not, and she's desperate to escape (Han rescues her).
    -   Admiral Greelanx turns out to have a mistress, which Han calculates and uses for an interview with him. Bria also uses another admiral's interest as part of her undercover work in the Corellian Resistance. They're both described as at least middle-aged if not older. In the latter case though he's all talk and no action, saying this is common of men his age, but they still like being _seen_ with a beautiful young woman to make others jealous.
-   Mr. Whittier from _Haunted (2005)_ appears to be one of these except he's actually thirteen.
-   Cray from _The Hunger Games_. He takes advantage of poor, starving young women of District 12 to get them to sleep with him. Katniss says that if she didn't know how to hunt, she'd have been forced to go to Cray.
-   _Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?_: Bell's grandfather is the one who tried to convince him to be a Harem Seeker, and every flashback involves him giving Bell perverted advice. As it turns out, he's actually _Zeus_, which explains a lot.
-   Charles from _Jade Green_ is the ultimate example of this trope, lusting for Judith even though she is fifteen years old (and his cousin) and he happens to be forty years old. After the title character rejects him, he proceeds to murder her and chop off her hand, and when Judith does the same, he proceeds to try to murder her as well, though not before raping her.
-   _Jakub Wędrowycz_ not only really likes girls (as long as he can get his hands on some Viagra) but also has the appropriate equipment. Probably one of the many reasons why, when he goes to confession (every few years), the priests usually react with panic or fainting.
-   Humbert Humbert, the Villain Protagonist of _Lolita_, a pedophile who marries a woman solely so he can lust after her titular daughter. After the woman's death, he kidnaps the girl and sexually abuses her for several years until she escapes as a teenager.
-   The protagonist of _Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation_, Rudeus Greyrat, was a 34-year-old perverted shut-in otaku in his past life. Interestingly (or not), he keeps his memories when he reincarnates as Rudeus, making him a strange mix of this and a Dirty Kid for much of his childhood.
-   Charles Bukowski wrote a collection of short stories and essays called _Notes of a Dirty Old Man_.
-   Simona Ahrnstedt gives us two possible examples in _Överenskommelser_.
    -   It is clear that Count Rosenschiöld only wishes to marry the female protagonist Beatrice, who happens to be like forty years younger than him because he wants a teenage virgin. And it also turns out that he's a serial abuser of women and a cruel rapist.
    -   And we also have Beatrice confirming that there was quite some age difference between her parents, which could make her father come across as a milder case of this. But even though Beatrice states that her mother was only seventeen years old at their marriage, we have no idea how old her father was at the time. We're most likely talking about a May-September Romance rather than a May-December Romance though.
-   Reginald Bretnor: Professor Shimmelhorn is said to be quite the charmer of women young and old, and in a more vital sense his hyped-up sex drive seems to inspire his creative streak. Even more important to his fate is his dragonish wife, a tough if Clean Old Woman who tries to keep him on track, and usually balances out his wild karma.
-   Isaac Asimov: Due to what was considered "good taste" when publishing his stories, Dr Asimov restrained himself to oblique references and implications. However, he was able to publish several volumes of _Lecherous Limericks_ as well as _The Sensuous Dirty Old Man_ (a parody of _The Sensuous Woman_), and he was given a plaque during a Fan Convention commemorating this aspect of his career. He accepted the plaque (and its implications) in good grace.
-   _A Series of Unfortunate Events_
    -   It's debatable how much Count Olaf is focused on this, but in his ploy to marry Violet to get at her fortune, he certainly points out her looks more than once (and plans to be kind and let her live). His later girlfriend, Esme Squalor, is young enough to have once been his student. Who knows about Kit, though.
    -   Also, The Bald Man. In the first book, there is a scene where he approaches Violet, takes her face in his rough hands, and calls her a 'pretty one'.
    -   Another instance of the creepy attentions Violet received in the first book is when The Hook-handed Man approaches her in the tower, telling her, "I'm so glad you're here. I was just thinking how much wanted to see your pretty face."
-   Dayless, the eponymous Conqueror in _Shadow of the Conqueror_. Even up to the end of his reign, old age did nothing to curb his lust for pretty young girls. It took a fall from power and total impotence to finally end his escapades. Amusingly, when he regains his youth twenty years later and sets out on his Redemption Quest, he becomes a Celibate Hero despite his body's angry protests and teenaged girls almost always being attracted to him.
-   Walder Frey in _A Song of Ice and Fire_. He's over ninety and on his eighth wife and has children, grandchildren, and at least one great-grandchild who are as old as or older than she is. Neither age nor marriage stops him from leering at any woman to cross his path. Made even clearer in the series:
    
    **Walder Frey** (to Catelyn Stark): Fifteen years old, she is. A delicate little flower... and the honey's all mine.
    
-   Jubal Harshaw, in _Stranger in a Strange Land_ and other Robert A. Heinlein works, is a bit of this with Chivalrous Pervert.

-   _Viceroy's Pride_: Right before Dan leaves for Twilight, Henry Ibis advises him to find some nubile, naive natives and seduce them. He literally and explicitly sees Dan as a Stock Light-Novel Hero. Dan is disgusted that _this_ is what Ibis is worried about on a mission to save the Earth when they were just discussing how Dan could be tortured or killed.
-   Emperor Henrick of _The Witchlands_ is a middle-aged man who's a tad more interested in teenage Safi than having an arranged marriage with her justifies.
-   Although this is not stated to be the case in the games he originated from, Paulo Orlovsky, the reclusive dictator of the Empire in the tie-in novel for the _Gadget: Past as Future_ series, is one of these. Before the present events of the book, Orlovsky became so obsessed with a friend's daughter, protagonist Elena Hausmann (whose age at that point isn't specified but implied to be in her late teens/early 20's while Orlovsky was old enough to be her grandfather, and he most likely had eyes on her for long before that), that he tried to propose to her, to which Elena vehemently turned down. In retaliation, Orlovsky denied Elena her dream of becoming a scientist at the Empire's top academy, leaving her stuck in a dead-end job at the library. Despite her rejection, Orlovsky still remains passionate about Elena, keeping a book full of dozens of surveillance photos of her.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Young Mr. Grace from _Are You Being Served?_, despite being practically unable to move unassisted, was a Dirty Old Man to the core. He once fired a secretary because his heart rate alarm didn't go off when she bent over in front of him.
-   George Bluth, Sr. from _Arrested Development_. He once asked a group of dolls which of them wanted to take their shirt off. Granted, he was a little stir-crazy at the time...
-   Benny Hill often played his characters in _The Benny Hill Show_ this way, though reportedly he saw it more as childish playfulness than randy cheekery.
-   The song "Little Girl" from _A Bit of Fry and Laurie_ is sung by a Dirty Old Man character.
-   In the _Broad City_ episode "Game Over," an old man in Abbi's exercise class pretends to pass out in the water so she'll pull him out and give him CPR. When she yells at him, he says, "I know how to do it without popping your cherry. Your husband will never suspect on your wedding night."
-   Pierce from _Community_ has no limits as far as this trope is concerned.
-   On season 2 of _Dancing with the Stars_, competitor George Hamilton confessed that he became more interested in trying to win over his rival Stacy Keibler, who was a good forty years younger than him, than he was in trying to win the competition.

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Doctor has occasionally been accused of this since he's centuries-old and most of his companions have been young women, such as in "Meanwhile in the TARDIS 2". He doesn't take the accusation especially well.
    -   "The Unquiet Dead": Rose is at one point drugged and kidnapped by undertaker Gabriel Sneed, who's desperate to cover up the fact that he has a zombie problem at his business. She later angrily accuses him of copping a feel while he was loading her into his hearse.

-   In _Extras_, Patrick Stewart is portrayed this way.
    
    **Patrick Stewart:** So in my film, I play a man who controls the world with his mind.  
    **Andy Millman:** Right. Oh, that's interesting.  
    **Patrick Stewart:** Yeah. For instance, I'm walking along, and I see this beautiful girl, and I think I'd like to see her naked, and so all her clothes fall off.  
    **Andy Millman:** All her - clothes fall off?  
    **Patrick Stewart:** Yes, and she's scrabbling around to get them back on again, but even before she can get her knickers on, I've seen everything. Yeah. I've seen it all.
    
-   Father Jack in _Father Ted_. Being a Catholic priest hasn't stopped him from maintaining a healthy love of the ladies. Although not as frequent as his shouting "Feck", "Drink" or "Arse", he quite often shouts "Girls", and he has been shown variously reading dirty magazines with such delight that he _fails to notice his hair is on fire_, judging a wet t-shirt contest (where his job seems to consist of staring and growling "more water") and, in a flashback, convincing a class of teenage girls in a nunnery to take their tennis lessons topless... This is just the tip of the iceberg, too.
-   _Frasier_: Martin takes a shine to one of Daphne's friends, who's young enough to be his daughter, and starts unsubtly flirting with her. Daphne is horrified when she works out what he's doing and calls him this trope by name.
-   _Friends_: One of Phoebe's elderly massage clients dies on her table. Phoebe, believing the client's spirit is possessing her, meets with the woman's husband to find out if there was any Unfinished Business she can take care of to help the woman move on. The man sees an opportunity and tells Phoebe his wife said she wanted to have sex with him one last time.
    
    **Phoebe:** I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head right now.  
    **Old Man:** (_to Joey_) Worth a shot, huh?
    
-   _Fringe_: William Bell turns out to be one when he starts flirting with Astrid. For added awkwardness, his soul is currently occupying Olivia Dunham's body.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Walder Frey, who is past 90, publicly gropes and boasts of bedding his 15-year-old wife and utters filthy innuendos pretty much every time he opens his mouth.
    -   Despite his age and vow of celibacy, Grand Maester Pycelle has no qualms about hiring prostitutes and offering free "medical examinations" to young handmaidens.
    -   Littlefinger's attraction to Sansa, who is explicitly young enough to be his daughter. Shae dryly comments that men never see themselves as too old.
    -   Craster practices Parental Incest with his daughters, and their daughters, and _their_ daughters...
-   When Old from _The Gnomes of Dulwich_ isn't asleep, he has a keen eye for the female gnomes.
-   Roman Emperor Tiberius (a.k.a. The Old He-Goat) is portrayed as a truly filthy old bastard in _I, Claudius_. This characterization was inherited from Tacitus and Suetonius, the two major Roman sources for the period.
    -   Tiberius also admits to being a dirty old man in the earlier series _The Caesars_, although this is greatly downplayed compared to _I, Claudius_.
-   Benjamin Franklin in _John Adams_, wherein the relatively prudish Adams is horrified by Franklin's behavior (particularly in Paris) and gets the shock of his life when he sees Franklin in a bathtub playing chess with Madame Helvétius. On the other hand, the audience is laughing.
-   Max Weinberg (also the drummer of the E Street Band) is portrayed as this on _Late Night with Conan O'Brien_, as well as on the latter's run on _The Tonight Show_.
-   Pop from _The League of Gentlemen_ is not only perverted but also extremely violent when provoked which means he can force himself upon his son's girlfriend right in front of him and get away with it.
-   _Legends of the Superheroes_: "The Roast" has Dr. Sivana force the superheroes to accept medical checkups from him. When he approaches Black Canary and the Huntress, it becomes clear that he's using the checkup as an excuse to get close to them, but Huntress makes it clear that he'll face severe retaliation if he lays a finger on her.
-   Stanley H. Tweedle, captain of the _Lexx_, constantly trying to get any, so much it became a plot device in the series.
-   _Mad Men_:
    -   Roger Sterling. He gets away with it to a certain degree (he's rich and not that hard on the eyes, and it's 1960).
    -   Bert Cooper gives every indication that he would have qualified (he keeps a print of _The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife_ in his office, for crying out loud!) if it were not for the interference of a Dr. Lyle Evans, whom it appears gave Cooper an unnecessary orchiectomy back in the 1940s, and whom Sterling believes Cooper had killed for his trouble.
-   _Merlin (2008)_:
    -   Agravaine, who is fascinated with both Morgana and Guinevere in the creepiest way possible.
    -   Also joked about in season 1 in reference to Gaius. When it appears that Merlin is dying, Gaius hugs a crying Gwen to comfort her. Merlin picks that moment to wake up and say "That's disgusting. You should be ashamed of yourself. You're old enough to be her grandfather."
-   For the dirty mac brigade version, there's a fair number of _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ appearances by a man in... well... a dirty mac.
-   Jackson Gibbs, father of Leeroy Jethro Gibbs in _NCIS_ hits on both Ziva and Abby in the first episode he's in, to their mild amusement and Gibbs's silent embarrassment.
-   Admiral Al Calavicci in _Quantum Leap_, contrasting the younger Chaste Hero, Samuel Beckett. Al brags about his past love life, ogles all of the young women Sam encounters (often advising him to have sex with them, too), and makes very suggestive comments designed to fly over the heads of younger viewers. When Sam finds out that dead bodies creep out Al, he quips, "Finally, something sexual you're _not_ into." When the two switch places in one episode, _Sam_ becomes the dirty pervert suggesting sex and getting distracted by attractive women.
-   King Henry II of France in _Reign_, who not only has a mistress but in the first episode hits on, successfully, one of his future daughter-in-laws' handmaidens.
-   Ernie Rayner in the _Only Fools and Horses_ Prequel _Rock & Chips_.
-   Artie Johnson's "Tyrone F. Horneigh" (pronounced "horn-eye") from _Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In_ is probably the archetypal example of the comedy version.
-   _Sanford and Son_: Fred. _Sanford and Son_ is the Transatlantic Equivalent of _Steptoe and Son_, and as such, Fred possesses many of his counterpart's traits.
    
    **Lamont:** You're a dirty old man!  
    **Fred:** That's right! And I'm gonna be one 'til I'm a dead old man!
    
-   Bob Kelso of _Scrubs_ could also qualify for this trope. Though a little surprise comes in "My Tuscaloosa Heart," wherein viewers find out Kelso loves his wife very much.
-   In _Smallville_, Lionel Luthor shows signs of this when he is not busy over some Evil Plan. He doesn't bother to hide it when he is in Clark's body.
-   _Star Trek_
    -   In the Original Series pilot "The Cage" Captain Pike jokes with Dr. Boyce that all ship's doctors are dirty old men.
    -   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
        -   Curzon Dax (predecessor of Jadzia Dax) was like this. Many stories involving him and his friend Captain Sisko tend to involve copious amounts of intoxicants and barely-dressed females of various intelligent species. He was also Trill Ambassador to the Federation.
        -   Grand Nagus Zek, ruler of the Ferengi. His first act upon arriving at DS9 is to sample five sexual holosuite programs in succession, despite Quark's concerns that the programs in question may be "a touch energetic for his advanced years".
-   _Steptoe and Son_: Albert Steptoe is one of the Ur Examples, and probably a candidate for Trope Namer into the bargain.
-   _The Strange Calls_: Gregor looks like an old man, though he has a Vague Age, variously claiming to be 47 or 90 as convenient for him. But he's certainly dirty. He is very enamored with cam whore websites and frequently uses them while Toby is in the room, and often makes inappropriate sexual comments.
-   _Succession_:
    -   Senior Waystar executive Karl Mueller is past middle age and is said to frequent brothels whenever he goes on business trips. He protests that his wife understands that he's a "libertine."
    -   Lester "Mo" McClintock is a serial rapist version of the trope.
-   _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody_ , despite being a Disney Kid Com, once had a one-off character named Leo who qualified as this, as he was constantly hitting on his private nurse and the eponymous twins’ mother in a non-too-subtle way for a show aimed at pre-teens.
-   _Three's Company_: Ralph Furley, the landlord, was portrayed as this.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: In "Twenty-Two", the doctor is very lecherous, telling his patient Liz Powell, a professional dancer, that she makes an old doctor wish that he was a young intern. He then laughs creepily. As she is leaving the hospital, he says that he hopes that she will be performing the next time that he sees her and that she will throw a wink in his direction.
-   Van Kooten En De Bie: De Vieze Man, a character played by Van Kooten, who wears a shabby coat and constantly gets aroused whenever he talks about filthy stuff like dog turds.

Don Vito from _Viva La Bam_: Here are a couple things to describe Vito, He blabbers and freaks out uncontrollably, his favorite food is veal scallopini from Antonio's, he definitely loves the ladies to an extreme, He's Phil Margera's older brother, but sadly he hates Russia.

    Music 

-   The Beatles's _Mean Mister Mustard_ from _Abbey Road_, who yells obscene things at the Queen and is described in the lyrics as "a dirty old man".
-   The Jethro Tull song _Aqualung_ portrays two sides of one of these characters.
    -   And Pearl Jam's "tribute" to that song, _Even Flow_.
-   Love/Hate's Rock Queen. The girl is thirteen.
-   KISS' _Christine Sixteen_.
    -   An even better (worse?) example is "Goin' Blind", where there's a _77-year age difference_ between an old man and his girlfriend.
-   Serge Gainsbourg. See his song "Lemon Incest" or the album _Histoire de Melody Nelson_. Or his alter-ego, Gainsbarre.
-   Carly Pearce's "Next Girl" – the video for the song (set at a roadside bar) has Pearce, in various personas, propositioned by men who want her only for sex. One scene is quite blatant: A middle-aged man badgers a waitress to come over so he can comment on her good looks.
-   Queen: "Great King Rat was a dirty old man and a dirty old man was he."
-   _D.I.N.O.$.A.U.R._ by Ke$ha. "You're just an old man, hittin' on me. What? You need a CAT scan!"
-   _Pussy Walk_ by Iggy Pop.
-   This is one possible interpretation of The Stranglers' _Peaches_.
-   The Veronicas have a song called Lolita about this power play.
-   Seemingly, Mr Moore from Royal Republic's 'Underwear'. "I can see your underwear/from down here!"
-   Oingo Boingo's "Nothing to Fear": "Won't you let me buy you candy? / Or perhaps a chocolate shake? / Or perhaps some nice cocaine?"
-   The Beach Boys quite a bit in the late Seventies. "Roller Skating Child," "Lazy Lizzy," and God forbid, the original, unreleased version of "Hey Little Tomboy." \*shudders\*
-   The Fugs' "Dirty Old Man" is a surprisingly lecherous one considering the song was released in 1966.
-   The Three Degrees had a song called _Dirty Old Man_.
-   The Donnas' "Are You Gonna Move It For Me": "Somebody call the bouncer, get this guy off the stage/He wrote his number on his boxers, but he's three times my age." Bonus fact: it's the opening track from their album _The Donnas Turn 21_.
-   Lemon Demon's "The Oldest Man on MySpace":
    
    When I see a teenaged girl all made up like a whore,
    
    It takes me straight back to the Second World War,
    
    But I know she’ll never love an old fart like me,
    
    Which is why I put my age as 23.
    
-   Lyrics to the hit single "My Sharona" by The Knack include "Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind / I always get it up, for the touch of the younger kind".
-   Tom Lehrer's song "Smut" includes the lyric "And the Wizard of Oz / There's a dirty old man!"
-   Subversion: "Young Girl" by Gary Puckett & the Union Gap," a first-person ode where the older guy doesn't want to mess around with a sexually charged youngster.

    Myths & Religion 

-   The two elders from the tale of Susanna, a Bible apocrypha usually included as one of the chapters of the Book of Daniel in Catholic Bibles, make it Older Than Feudalism.
-   Merlin. Makes sense since his father was apparently an incubus. His lust for young maidens even leads to his downfall thanks to Nimue.
-   Norse Mythology has Njord who ships his children, had children with his sister and apparently got a golden shower one time. Even Loki thinks he needs to control himself.
    -   There is also Odin, who, contrary to popular belief, is not less of a wise old god like Yahweh, and more of a Trickster God who enjoys sleeping around from time to time. He has frequently used sex to get into the good graces of people who possess knowledge he wants.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Ric Flair has lived this trope at least since 2002, when he returned to WWE (and much later moved on to TNA) after having apparently lost his final match to Sting on the very last episode of _WCW Monday Nitro_ in March 2001. (He was well over 50 years old by that point and quickly became Triple H's lackey in Evolution, and everyone believed that he was not only well past his prime but thoroughly washed up; how wrong we all were.) Out of countless instances of his being a Dirty Old Man during these years, a few stand out.
    -   At TNA's _Bound for Glory_ event in 2010, Flair and the other members of his "Fortune" stable (playfully) threatened to gang-rape backstage interviewer Christy Hemme; oddly, Hemme herself seemed to find the joke funny.
    -   Then there was the night on _Monday Night Raw_ in 2004 when Flair, Stacy Keibler, and several other Superstars were competing in a game of musical chairs for the prize of Number One Contendership to the World Heavyweight Championship. (Cloudcuckoolander Eugene was Guest General Manager for the night, and the game was completely his idea, although that in itself doesn't really explain anything.) Flair managed to survive halfway through, but then when Keibler beat him to the final chair in the next round, he grabbed her, lifted her bodily out of the chair, and sat down in the chair with Keibler in his lap, child-molester style, to make the referee think he'd gotten there first. Everybody just laughed and Flair was dismissed without incident; even Keibler herself seemed flattered by the attention she was getting. (In case you're wondering, by the way, the musical-chairs winner ended up being Chris Jericho.)
    -   And then there was Edge and Lita's infamous "Live on Air Sex Celebration" on Raw 2006. The two were just starting to get it on when along came Ric, waltzing down the ramp with a bold offer to teach Edge "how to pump the lady" and making it clear he wasn't gonna take no for an answer. This enraged Edge, who then proceeded to beat the interloping Flair to a pulp before he could even enter the ring, much to Lita's relief (and everyone else's).
    -   Perhaps one of the most notorious examples is when the heel tag team Deuce & Domino were looking for Domino's sister, Cherry. They finally saw her emerge from a closet in the hallway... and then, seconds later, Flair emerged from the closet as well! Yes: assuming Cherry really was as young as she looked (about 16 or 17, one would guess), Ric Flair committed offstage statutory rape just for the fun of it.
    -   He also forced himself on Torrie Wilson and Becky Lynch at different points in time.
    -   He doesn't just play this trope for the cameras. Many charges of sexual assault have piled up over the years, implying that The Nature Boy has difficulty taking "no" for an answer, even at his age.
-   Vince McMahon, who would often boast of his sexual prowess and had several on-screen affairs with girls a fraction of his age like Trish Stratus and Candice Michelle.
-   When Ken Shamrock was 35, he was booked with 19-year-old Alicia Webb who played his little sister, Ryan. They eventually became involved offscreen, and Ken's marriage broke up as a result.
-   Jerry Lawler has always been pretty open about his interest in younger women and used to spend most of the women's matches practically drooling over them. He was especially perverted as a heel commentator during the Attitude Era. Even post-Attitude Era, he once claimed to be the father of Kelly Kelly's unborn child (this was all a ruse cooked up to fool Jerry Springer), only to be reminded that Kelly was "too old" for his tastes. Kelly was 24 at the time, and could pass for much younger.
-   Japanese wrestlers Yoshiaki Fujiwara, Satoru Sayama, and Don Arakawa used to sneak a peek in the woman's bath of the inns they lived in when they were on tour.
-   "Mean" Gene Okerlund was given a "dirty old man" gimmick towards the end of his WCW run. He'd openly leer at the breasts and butts of divas while interviewing them, especially Nancy Benoit.
    -   Okerlund has gone on record that this was an angle that Vince Russo demanded he take, and it made him very uncomfortable to do, as his children (and grandchildren) would see it on TV.

    Puppet Shows 

-   Niles Standish of _Crank Yankers_. He's a rich British earl who likes to do things like calling up a woman who does calligraphy and try to have her make up an invitation for "an ass-slapping competition."
-   _The Funday Pawpet Show_ features Hugh Manatee, a lecherous and slightly senile sea cow (heavily implied to be retirement age) with an inordinate fondness for older women, Floridian celebrities, and the occasional inanimate object. It's possible JR (his puppeteer) did it just for the opportunity to make a 'dirty old manatee' pun.
-   The puppet of Dominque Strauss-Kahn from the French satirical show _Les Guignols de l'Info_ has been portrayed as this following his Real Life counterpart's sexual assault allegations.

    Radio 

-   Sir Gregory in _The Men from the Ministry_ is an old Permanent Under-Secretary who's after the young women of the Ministry, especially Ms. Daphney Bentwater from the typing pool.

    Roleplay 

-   Danya, the Big Bad of _Survival of the Fittest_, can smack of this at times, and very often it overlaps with Nightmare Fetishist since usually it involves commentary about the female students in the game. Granted, one could say that he is hoping for Fanservice for the ratings, but sometimes, you have to wonder...

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Paranoia_:
    -   Amazingly, one NPC manages it: Innocent-MAN's name saves him from being terminated as a traitor (due to a bug in the justice software), his mutant power of regeneration saves him from being killed accidentally, then the "dirty" part finally kicks in after The Computer crashes and lots of clones stop getting dosed with hormone suppressants.
    -   High Programmers have the clearance to learn about the significance of sex, the authority to go off hormones and build their own harems, and the power and security to age enough to count as "old." As such, you'll probably run into quite a few of these guys if you ever have to deal with anyone at Ultraviolet clearance.
-   When Paizo Publishing ran a caption competition for this piece of artwork<small>◊</small> for Pathfinder, a number of entries made Ezren (the old wizard reclining in the background) to be the real perv through the use of scrying spells, despite the more obvious target of Valeros (the fighter guy in the pool).
-   Codifier Togan from Soda Pop Miniatures's Relic Knights series is their iconic dirty old man. He's banned from ships, stations, and several planets. His miniature depicts him reaching out to pinch his Doctrine scribe Cecillia's backside, and the concept art goes a step further (he's actually pinching her there).

    Theatre 

-   Lazar in _Fiddler on the Roof_ is usually played as a subversion. Yes, he does show a lot of interest in Tzeitel, eventually asking Tevye for her hand in marriage, but his attentions are rarely if ever played as sexual. Rather, Lazar is a lonely old widower, and Tevye's daughters are the only unmarried Jewish women of marriageable age around. Tevye is a bit squicked at the thought of having a son-in-law his own age, but thinks that Lazar has been married, and is proven to be a good provider and non-abusive, is a mark in his favor. Tzeitel, on the other hand, is angry, but less because she thinks Lazar would be a bad husband for her and more because she already has a boyfriend she could have been married to already, had he simply grown a pair and asked Tevye before Lazar got the chance.
-   Senex from _A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum_. His wife even gets a song about him called—what else?—"That Dirty Old Man."

    Video Games 

-   Kapp'n, the boat rower/driver from the _Animal Crossing_ games, has a tendency to flirt with female characters, especially in his _City Folk_ incarnation as a bus driver. He genuinely complements them frequently, however, so he comes off as more charming than creepy. Usually.
-   Augus from _Asura's Wrath_, who states he has had Carnal Knowledge of the fairest maidens in heaven. Overlaps this with Cool Old Guy, Old Master, and Eccentric Mentor.
-   _Bloodborne_ has Gehrman, the Eccentric Mentor of the hunters. He has a book called "How to pick up Fair Maidens" in his workshop, and the way how he told you to "use the doll" falls into this trope. If you explored the Astral Clocktower, you can find Gehrman's very first victim of his curious mania: Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower.
-   _Breath of Fire III_ has the Dragon Elder, who, to continue his exposition, asks for a cute girl. The way to progress is to bring Nina, but Hilarity Ensues should the player bring Momo (and Rei for a Funny Background Event) instead.
-   Not a character, but _Dead or Alive_ has some fun with this. There is a setting in the second game and the infamous volleyball spinoff to set the player's age. The higher the setting, the more active the Jiggle Physics become. As the maximum setting (99 years old), it would be very likely impossible for an actual 99-year-old man to play the game without having a heart attack.
-   Uncle Gamlen from _Dragon Age II_ fits this trope to a tee. He frequents the city's brothel on a regular basis and, if Hawke is female and romances Isabela, he eagerly inquires what the sex is like.
    -   Orsino has shades of this in a conversation about blood mages with Snarky!Hawke.
        
        **Hawke**: So I shouldn't slit my wrists and dance naked under the moonlight just to fit in?  
        **Orsino**: Well, if that's what's going to happen, perhaps I should come with you after all.
        
-   Rab in _Dragon Quest XI_ is likely a Captain Ersatz of Master Roshi, and is shown to have an impressive collection of dirty magazines. As a boy, he went through Training from Hell in magic and martial arts under the beautiful Grand Master Pang and was infamous for having been paddled by her over 10,000 times over the course of it. It's revealed in one sidequest that at least some of those he intended to have happen.
-   _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_:
    -   Divayth Fyr, 4000-year-old wizard, has created four Opposite-Sex Clone "daughters", who are alternately referred to as his "wives," in an odd combination of Parental Incest and Screw Yourself. However, potentially Downplayed in that it isn't played off as very Squicky, at least within his tower.
    -   Crassius Curio, Councilor of Great House Hlaalu, is one. He's a Depraved Bisexual interested in anything that moves with Camp Gay dialogue and he can't be all that young, having risen to the top of House Hlaalu as an outlander.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  If the Player Character wants his support in House Hlaalu and in the main quest, he _will_ want to see the PC naked and can be bribed with a _kiss_ if he likes the PC enough. That said, he's still one of the least corrupt characters in the game and is a Guile Hero Obfuscating Stupidity in order to accomplish his goals, which allows his rivals to think he's just an easily manipulated fool and thus, not one they need to worry about.
-   In _Fatal Fury 2_ one of Mai Shiranui's mentors (the other being her grandfather) is Jubei Yamada (a playable character from the first game) who was definitely one of these; the fact that Mai herself is so, uh, well-endowed didn't help matters.
-   _Fate/Grand Order_:
    -   King David of the Bible is summoned as a Servant in his physical prime. But since he was an elderly man who tried to have a relationship with his maid Abishag at the time of his death, he still has the _personality_ of a dirty old man.
    -   Merlin is one, and it's pointed out it is because his father was an incubus.
    -   Edward Teach/Blackbeard wants to use the Holy Grail to wish for a harem, and he likes spending time with little girls.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   _Final Fantasy VI_:
        -   Edgar Roni Figaro. Technically, he wasn't old (he was 27 during the events of the game), but he was implied to have an attraction to Relm Arowny at one point (specifically, before leaving the town to track down Kefka and Gestahl for their betrayal, he mentions that Relm has another eight years to go and that he hopes that she's still around by then), who at that time was 10 years old and most likely young enough to be his daughter.
        -   Ultros. He attempts to grope Terra and flirts with Relm, to the point where she's able to save the party from him by charming him into letting her paint his portrait. Ultros's later appearances exaggerate this aspect of him, pushing him into Depraved Bisexual territory.
    -   Ardyn in _Final Fantasy XV_ is described as such by Noctis, due to his Obviously Evil mannerisms and the fact that he's stalking a carload of young, handsome boys.
-   NOT Played for Laughs in _Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem_, where Lang and his troops take all the young and pretty girls from Grust away and it's all but stated that they'll be either raped and killed or made sex slaves.
    
    **Villager**: _This country no longer has any young girls. The imperial soldiers took them all away. Especially beautiful girls, who were all taken by General Lang. What kind of world has this become?_  
    **Maillesia** (to Marth): "I have already become of age... But, my grandmother lied for me so the soldiers wouldn’t take me away. Well, I know if I stay here I will eventually be discovered and captured by the imperial soldiers. Lang’s soldiers are like beasts!"
    
-   Johnny from _Guilty Gear_, who while not exactly _old_, keeps only young (and often underage) women around as his crew (except maybe the fat cook). He also hits on Bridget, who is definitely not legal (or female, but that's another story). Baiken even _calls_ Johnny a dirty old man in her pre-fight introduction. It's Slightly Subverted by the fact that Johnny's back story has him carrying on his dead foster father's legacy of rescuing orphaned children from a life of loneliness and misery he once lived, but the fact that he only adopts young girls doesn't stop fans from essentially calling him a pedophile.
-   In _L.A. Noire_, a case where you play as secondary character Jack Kelso has you walk in on a person of interest, Curtis Benson (who is 52 years old) engaged in sexual activity with a young woman who reveals to Jack that she's 12 years old. Jack is appalled, though Curtis is not ashamed of his actions.
-   Father Salade in _La Pucelle: Tactics_. Shortly into the game, it's found out that he suggested the two female leads' costumes, including a "micro-mini under your robe" for Alouette. He's found out when the two girls compare notes.
-   Doctor Wilbur Feels in _Laura Bow: The Colonel's Bequest_.
    -   I'll not be examined by _Dr. Feels_, thanks. Ew.
-   Vaati from _The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords_. He is a hundred-year-old eyeball monster, yet the manual says his only motive is kidnapping any young girl that takes his fancy.
-   One video from the Secret Theater in _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_ portrays The End as such.
-   _Lollipop Chainsaw_: Junji Morikawa's hobbies are listed as: karate, Kama Sutra, collecting women's underwear.
-   Most of the older men in _Metal Gear Solid_ can come off as Dirty Old Men... mostly because Hideo Kojima is a dirty middle-aged man.
    -   Volgin from _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_ was possibly portrayed as such in addition to Depraved Bisexual, as Volgin, according to character sheets, was in his fifties at the time of the game, and one of his lovers, Raikov, was either in his twenties or in his very late teenaged years. EVA/Tatyana was also around her late twenties.
-   Professor Theo from _Mischief Makers_, who often attempts to grope Marina after he's been rescued. He also seems pleasantly surprised when Marina turns human in the secret ending.
-   _Mother 3_ has Mike, an elderly resident of Tazmily Village. It's more or less an offhand comment in that particular instance and doesn't come up again.
-   Lucaim Nav<small>◊</small> of _Phantasy Star Universe_ definitely qualifies as this. He's a 200-year-old CAST (robot) who is always trying to cop a feel of some helpless young woman's behind. This is made funnier in the final story mission by the fact your party has just infiltrated the giant HIVE planet Rykros housing the final confinement system and getting into a deep discussion about the true nature of the SEED, the planet itself, and the evil entity known as Dark Falz. Cut to a scene of Nav trying to grab President Laia's ass to "lighten up the mood" right after the end of the discussion.
-   In _Pokémon Red and Blue_ and their remakes, there's this old dude peering into the windows of the Celadon Gym. Game Freak got a little too carried away with the sexual references.
    
    **Old Man:** Heheh... This GYM is great! It's full of women!
    
    -   He had the above line in both the original _Pokémon Red and Blue_, the remakes _FireRed and LeafGreen_, and the original _Pokémon Gold and Silver_, but apparently someone complained as the line was removed in the remakes _HeartGold_ and _SoulSilver_.
    
    **Old Man:** Heheh... This Gym is great! It's full of strong Trainers!
    
-   The Melee Island storekeeper from _The Secret of Monkey Island_ is revealed to be one when Guybrush eavesdrops on his conversation with Carla the Sword Master.
-   In _Sexy Parodius_, an aged Takosuke has become a dirty old octopus.
-   In _Silver Falls Gaiden: Deathly Delusion Destroyers And Ruby River_, Honard is an archery master who's in his 90s. But if you talk to him enough, he'll randomly complain about how there aren't any hot babes around.
-   This is how the Tinkerer is portrayed in _Spider-Man: Web of Shadows_. The price he demands to build a symbiote-killing sonic bomb includes large sums of money and "this girl from my favourite tool catalogue".
-   Clemente in _Tales of Destiny_ towards Philia. He picks her to be his master specifically because she's a beautiful young lady, and tries to get her to make sexy poses when casting magic.
-   Raven from _Tales of Vesperia_ is a younger one, being 35, and is of the Loveable Rogue sort, tolerated by everyone in the group except for Rita, who smacks him or blasts him with magic almost any time he says or does something pervy. He's even referred to as the trope title on multiple occasions.
-   Victor "Sully" Sullivan from _Uncharted_ is this. His behavior is frequently lampshaded.
-   _Tomb Raider_: Lara Croft's butler Winston, who appears in some of the newer games, seems to fit the Trope. When Lara is at home, he follows her _everywhere_, even when she tries to shower. (Why she hasn't fired him by now is anyone's guess.) Want to shoot him? You can try, but he'll block it with his tray, and that won't make him get the hint. (There is _one_ way to get him off her case, if you know the "fridge trick", but it's not easy to do.)
-   _Trails of Cold Steel:_ Alisa is 17. When she meets her grandfather Gwyn after not seeing him for a couple of years, he doesn't _quite_ say "Your tits are bigger now. Nice!", but it's clearly what he's thinking.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Justice For All_ has Dr. Hotti, who likes "examining" pretty girls and claims his specialty to be in "young, silky-smooth hottie patients". Thankfully (or not), he isn't a real doctor.
    -   _Trials and Tribulations_ features the 68-year-old Victor Kudo, who has a thing for maid outfits, but when Maya Fey, nineteen at the time, tries to use her maid uniform to ply him for information about the case, he rebuffs her.
-   Moe Mortelli from _Daughter for Dessert_ has cheated on his wife in the past and slept with at least one prostitute, but now, he limits his sexual “activities” to bawdy comments directed at the diner’s employees, as well as encouraging the protagonist to get sexual with them (or, barring that, with someone).
-   Subverted with Arnold in _Melody_. He goes to a strip club to unwind, but he isn't actually shown admiring any of the girls' attributes.
-   _Shining Song Starnova_ has a dark example with Oda, an elderly producer and paedophile who preys on the preteen Idol Singers that he manages. He tried to molest Aki when she was fourteen, leaving her deeply traumatized, and his ultimate goal is to become CEO of Golden Calf Productions so that his newfound wealth and power will let him indulge his perversities without fear of the law.
-   _Yo-Jin-Bo_ has your old attendant, Yahei, who is revealed in Mon-Mon's Good ending to enjoy spying on Hatsuhime in the bath. In that game, All Men Are Perverts...
-   In _Virtue's Last Reward_, Tenmyouji openly discusses "Grandpa Videos" and "Erotic Units" with his 10-year-old grandson Quark, although Quark presumably isn't allowed to actually _watch_ said videos since he mentions Tenmyouji keeps them in a locked cabinet. Sigma also comes across as one to the other players, but he's a 22-year-old college student in the body of an old man.

    Web Animation 

-   Nagato from _An Akatsuki's Life_. Well, he's not really an old man, but he sure looks like one.
-   Wise from _The LeBrons_. "All them young girls around here showing their skin!"
-   _Manga Soprano_:

-   _Revenge Films_: Timothy was a creepy 42-year-old worker who attended college just to hit on girls half his age. To boot, he went ballistic on a girl who got a boyfriend and used discriminatory language on a European exchange student for refusing to kiss him on the lips. Furthermore, he liked petite and young girls, dismissing those who actually looked their age as "old hags". He even demanded to be paired up with a girl for PE classes just to have an excuse to touch them. Moreover, he stalked and hit on a high school girl at an open campus and he was eventually arrested.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Blooming Faeries_ the court wizard is definitely this and it shows in quite a few ways.
-   Betelgeuse in _Cobweb and Stripes_, in keeping with the film characterization. It becomes progressively toned down as the storyline continues, however, and he turns into more of a Chivalrous Pervert.
-   Sensei Greg, anime martial arts teacher of _El Goonish Shive_, is notably _not_ a dirty old man. He does point it out, though.
    
    "Alas, it is my greatest shame as an anime martial arts instructor that I am neither an old man nor a pervert!"
    
-   In _Homestuck_, Jade's grandfather - who, at the time the comic takes place, is _ninety-nine years old_, collects photos of women from beauty parlours. Several characters comment on it as being creepy.
-   _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ has Mr. Dirtygeezer, a little old guy in a cowboy hat who buys naughty magazines at Bob's newsstand.
-   Many of the customers encountered in _Mike: Bookseller_ are this, much to the staff's displeasure.
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   Tarquin. He's been married nine times, every time to women who are much younger and very pretty, and that doesn't necessarily keep his attention off other women. They have very little to say in the matter; Julio has made a habit of rescuing Tarquin's lady victims whenever he can.
    -   Roy's deceased father Eugene. He uses his ability to watch events in the world of the living from Fluffy Cloud Heaven to spy on Haley in the shower and hooks up with fellow oathspirits (people who died before fulfilling a blood oath and thus are barred from the actual afterlife until one of their descendants fulfills it for them) because he doesn't really have much else to do. (And because marital vows are null and void after you die.)
-   Eldon, better known as DOM even by his adventuring companions, from _Planescape Survival Guide_.
-   Dr. Schlock from _Sluggy Freelance_.
-   _Unsounded_: Duane kicks an old man out of the Deadly Nevergreen brothel when he won't stop harassing the women who aren't prostitutes inside, saying they're only good for one thing and acting like they should service him.

    Web Original 

-   It is all but stated in the second episode of _Compelled Dual_ that Bertrand is this, and finds Leoril "very pretty." For Leoril's part, he's completely fine with it as long as Bertrand continues to give him money and doesn't try to touch him below the waist.
-   _SCP Foundation_ SCP-106 gives off the feel of one due to his preference for attacking people in the 10-25 age bracket. Suffice to say, this isn't even the creepiest thing about him.
-   There is one mentioned in the first chapter of _Twisted Cogs_, but this is mostly averted since most old men act professional and deserving of respect.
-   One of the first recurring characters in SMG4 bloopers (outside from Mario and SMG4 himself) was an elder person from _Pokemon_ whose main trait was being extremely dirty, even by the show's standards.

    Western Animation 

-   1894 French cartoon _Autour d'une cabine_ features a dirty old man peeping at a young lady as she changes into a swimming suit in a beach hut.
-   The Ice King from _Adventure Time_ spends most of his time spying on local princesses, plotting to kidnap and marry them. Then there's his attraction to Fionna, a fictional, aged-up, genderbent version of the little boy that keeps thwarting him. Of course, he's still completely senile, so he never seems to realize that girls aren't interested, marriage has sexual connotations, or that he's even old. This is because he was driven insane as a young man and became obsessed with finding his lost fiance.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: Iroh is usually well-behaved, but is not above a compliment or two for a pretty woman – or a not-so-pretty woman if he thinks it will get him preferential treatment. However, when June and Zuko are paralyzed by her Shirshu and June is thrown atop him, he doesn't move, even though Zuko points out the Shirshu didn't get him. He smiles, and June gives a quick look of outrage. She later refers to him as Zuko's "creepy grandpa."
-   _BoJack Horseman_:
    -   Deconstruction. BoJack has a tendency to sleep with women who are half his age, but in "Escape from LA", he comes really close to sleeping with Charlotte's seventeen-year-old daughter Penny. Despite 17 being the legal age of consent in New Mexico and Penny making the first move, Charlotte still threatens to kill BoJack if he ever comes near her again, and she most likely thinks that BoJack is a child molester. "That's Too Much, Man!" also reveals that the whole event traumatized Penny and she seems to know that it wasn't the right choice, and BoJack is shocked when he finds out when he sees her at her college.
    -   Deconstruction. The one thing that Mr. Peanutbutter sees in all women is their youth and carefree nature, which unfortunately predisposes him to choose very, very young women who are barely beginning to understand the world. He’s in deep denial over this and prefers to believe he just “ruins” them, but as the series goes on, this becomes a worsening problem for him with failed marriage after failed marriage due to his unaware jackass behavior, immaturity, and lack of intelligence picking them apart and gradually going for younger girls, culminating with Pickles, his girlfriend in season 5, who is less than half his age. When Diane suggests one way to break his divorce cycle is to start dating older women (i.e. women his own age), he actually grimaces.
-   The short _Boos in the Nite_ has a scene where some ghosts play spin the bottle and an old ghost with a beard is elated when he gets kissed by a younger, more attractive female ghost.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   Glenn Quagmire is the most prominent example of not only being a dirty old man but being hypersexual in the process. At age 61, despite looking half as old, he frequently indulges in sexual fetishes (from frotteurism and erotic asphyxiation to zoophilia and incest and necrophilia) and strikes up conversations with women less than half his age (with many of them in high school) with the obvious goal of having sex with them. In "Peter Griffin: Husband, Father, Brother?", he finds a bound and gagged high school cheerleader in a bathroom stall, and proclaims, "Dear Diary: Jackpot!".
    -   Herbert, the elderly pederast shows up from time to time just to say creepy stuff in his distinctive voice, usually to an unwary – or perhaps wary – Chris Griffin. Like the "Greased-up Deaf Guy", he was a one-note gag character that was simply too offensively funny to not bring back. He'd never be funny if he wasn't so old and feeble.
-   _Futurama_: Professor Farnsworth is over 160 years old and is sometimes shown to be a bit lecherous.
    -   In "When Aliens Attack", Farnsworth reminisces on how the last alien invasion led to the smartest people on the planet being forced to have sex, and is disappointed when he learns that the Omicronians have no intention of doing that.
    -   When de-aged to 53 in "Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles", his biggest concern is that he now requires a fake ID to rent "ultra-porn".
    -   "Rebirth", the premiere episode of the Comedy Central run, has Farnsworth slap Amy's rear after she is revived by the rebirth machine even though she's conscious.
    -   The 34th issue of the tie-in comic has Farnsworth go along with Fry's lie that he is blind so he can get away with ogling at a naked clone of Fry's ex-girlfriend Michelle.
-   Cotton Hill from _King of the Hill_ would take any opportunity to grab or slap a young woman's butt, he regularly visits strip joints to gawk at and flirt with the women, and he married a woman about 30 years younger than him.
-   When _The Old Man of the Mountain_ meets Betty Boop, he starts flirting with her, and before long begins chasing her, apparently with the intent of _raping_ her!
-   One episode of _Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero_ opens on Penn walking down a street while on a video call with his parents. After the conversation ends they get distracted, so Penn quickly reaches out to end the call — only to be stopped by a random old man.
    
    **Old Man:** Whoa, slow down, I love this channel.
    
-   Uncle Grandfather from _Perfect Hair Forever_ is a parody of this trope.
-   Popeye's dad, Poopdeck Pappy, was constantly flirting with women. Oddly enough, they often flirt back.
-   Old Man Hunger from _Ren & Stimpy_ is a strange, skinny and naked old man with a chicken drumstick leg on his head and a bandage on his butt. He can be found showing up randomly at inopportune moments for Ren and Stimpy.
-   Rick Sanchez from _Rick and Morty_ is portrayed as this. It's first seen in the pilot where Rick spends a large amount of time having sex with beautiful women in another dimension, to the point where his portal gun has no charge left. In "Lawnmower Dogs" Rick is seen to have a fetish for BDSM. In "Auto Erotic Assimilation" he makes a lot of rather bizarre sexual requests to Unity, including a giraffe and stands of men who remotely resemble his father.
-   _Rugrats_: In "Grandpa's Date", Grandpa Lou Pickles rents a few movies. He picks out _Reptar Come Home_ and _Reptar Redux_ for the babies to watch, and _Lonely Space Vixens_ for himself, cheekily noting that last one is for _after_ the kids go to bed.
-   _South Park_:
    -   Grandpa Marsh has several Dirty Old Man moments in the episode "Quintuplets 2000" when a set of little girl quintuplets and their grandmother stay at Stan's house.
    -   In the episode _Red Hot Catholic Love_ all the priests are proud paedophiles, who even wear altar boys on a leash. The priests with altar boys on a leash return in S10E11 "Hell on Earth 2006" when they're let in Satan's Birthday Bash.
-   This happened accidentally on _The Venture Brothers_ when Rusty slept with the 15-year-old head of his fan club in his late 20s/early 30s (she said she was 20).
