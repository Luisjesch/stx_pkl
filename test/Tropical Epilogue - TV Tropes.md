_"I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose_  
_Drinking fresh mango juice_  
_Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes_  
_Fun, fun, fun in the sun, sun, sun"_

The final shot of a story is a character relaxing on a sun lounger with a fruity umbrella drink, looking pleased with themself. Most likely wearing a colorful Hawaiian shirt amid a sea of Hula and Luaus. Neither of which is to say this is actually supposed to be Hawaii (which would be a _really stupid_ place for an American to flee to...) — it's more likely to be somewhere in Latin Land, the Caribbean or Oceania in general. British media has its own variation, usually involving the Costa del Sol, a famed retreat of British gangsters, or even Blackpool, where many Scottish gangsters avoided heat. Some works will substitute Southeast Asia.

As far as music goes, either "Aloha Oe" or something generically calypso will be playing in the background.

This can serve as a "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue for a Karma Houdini villain, in which case a triumphant Evil Laugh is rather likely. It's also commonly Invoked, or Discussed by characters who never ultimately manage to fulfill it (having clearly never heard of Retirony, One Last Job or the Unspoken Plan Guarantee).

This is the natural result of a successful Run for the Border.

Contrast You Wake Up on a Beach, when the story _begins_ with the character on the beach.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

    Comic Books 

-   _Astro City_: Played with in the story "Show 'Em All": The Junkman, having pulled off the perfect crime, gets his tropical epilogue before the story is more than two-thirds over. Then he realizes that the problem with pulling off a crime so perfect that nobody knows who did it is that _nobody knows who did it_ (which is a problem because he became a supervillain in the first place to make a point about what people like him are capable of), and goes back to have another go.
-   _Batman_
    -   The storyline _Heart of Hush_ ends on this note. Catwoman is relaxing at a resort while recovering from getting her heart ripped out, recording a message for Hush explaining how she got her revenge.

-   _Identity Disc_: Sandman, Vulture, Juggernaut (while he was still in the X-Men), Sabertooth, and a few others had them forced to work for a mysterious criminal mastermind who supposedly controlled New York's crime (as opposed to the Kingpin). Sandman refused to believe the guy was for real and was promptly disintegrated for his arrogance.

Then the end panel showed Sandman on a beach next to a mysterious shadowy figure with a Hawaiian shirt and clawed feet, who thanked Sandman for taking a dive to preserve his reputation.

-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   In one story, Mysterio's ultimate goal when he takes over the Maggia is to grab as much money as he can, and "buy an island in the tropics where I can sit under palm trees and drink things out of coconuts". At the end of the story, Mysterio is taking a sunbath wearing a colorful Hawaiian shirt under the palm trees... of an enormous sign at his department roof, thinking about how much he hates Spider-Man.
    -   In another, the epilogue is in the form of a letter sent by Black Cat from the safety of such a refuge.
    -   After the first battle between the original Hobgoblin and the original Green Goblin, we get an epilogue where Hobby is sitting on a tropical island with no extradition treaties, sipping a cocktail and happy to retire on what's left of his original fortune. Given that at the start of the story he'd been outed and in jail, and any time he's returned it's been used to show that he's a Magnificent Bastard.
-   _Ultimate Spider-Man_: Kingpin escaped from the country and ended in a tropical location. But, contrary to tradition, it was not a happy ending for him. He was angry about the whole thing, and expecting his lawyer to solve everything asap, so he can return.

-   The surviving mercenaries in _Respawn of the Dead_ eventually wind up in a coastal Mexican town.
-   _A Certain Crazy Christmas Special_: Bad Santa has wrecked the town and kidnapped several girls. He forces them to listen to music that will slowly brainwash them into being his slaves.

-   _Charlie's Angels (2000)_ ends with the Angels and Bosley enjoying a beach vacation that Charlie had rewarded them for completing their mission.

-   The protagonists of _Trading Places_ have one of these.
-   _Johnny English_ has a scene like this, with a twist: earlier in the film, the title character bungles up preventing a robbery, and invents a highly improbable "villain" to cover up his ineptness. The "villain" is shown to be a real person at the end in this scene, but that's pure coincidence.
-   _The Silence of the Lambs_ ends with Hannibal Lecter phoning Clarice from Bimini, where he's having an old friend for dinner.

-   Referenced in _Out of Sight_. Karen (Jennifer Lopez) mockingly asks bank robber Jack (George Clooney) if he imagines he'll retire to some tropical paradise. He counters that he always preferred mountains.
-   Kathleen Turner's character in _Body Heat_ ends this way, whatever her name may be.

-   _Dark Passage_ ends with Bogart and Bacall reuniting in Peru.
-   Amusingly subverted with Alec Guinness' character in _The Lavender Hill Mob_: Holland is relating the story to a fellow Englishman in the comfort of sunny Rio, but the man is revealed to be the police officer extraditing him back to England a year after the events.
-   At the end of the _Boris and Natasha_ movie, the title characters get warped back in time to the beginning of the movie. They then decide that they really don't want to go through all the grief they experienced throughout the film again, so they decide to quit their jobs and retire to Tahiti.

-   The bank robber in _Inside Man_ brags about this plan (though it's probably misdirection), though the cop he's talking to begs to differ:
    
    **Dalton Russell:** This time next week I'm going be sucking down pina coladas in a hot tub with a couple of girls named Amber and Tiffani.
    
-   The bad ending to the first _Wayne's World_ movie has the _villain_ and Wayne's love interest end up in one together (she's wearing a tiny bikini and tells him how great he was in bed last night as she hands him a drink). Then he turns to the camera and mocks the audience for expecting her to end up with a loser like Wayne. Good thing it's not the real ending.
-   _Dunston Checks In_ ends with the Grants adopting Dunston and moving to manage a new hotel in Bali. And then the same hotel inspector turns up...
-   Referenced by Zephram Cochrane in _Star Trek: First Contact_; this is what he plans to do after his warp engine makes him filthy rich, to Will Riker's amusement.

-   The Australian comedy _Malcolm_ ends with the protagonists escaping to Portugal.

-   Subverted in _Spider-Man: Far From Home_. The ending makes it look like Nick Fury has decided to take a vacation and is briefly seen on one of these. Then he gets up and reveals he's really taking a break in a hologram room from his new work onboard a Skrull spaceship.
-   _Judas Kiss_: The 'Three Months Later' epilogue shows Junior lying on a sunlounge on a beach in Mexico as a bikini-clad waitress brings him a fresh round of cold drinks.

    Literature

-   Played with in Matthew Reilly's _Ice Station_. The fate of a minor character from the backstory is revealed when the epilogue zips to a South American beach, where a scavenger finds debris in the ocean from the character's crashed plane.
-   At the end of _Captain Vorpatril's Alliance_, after what initially seems to be a case of Reassigned to Antarctica, Ivan manages to alter it to this instead by realizing that there's absolutely no reason why their planetary embassy needs to be in the rainswept capital rather than somewhere near the equator.
-   After the events of _Twelve Days_, Terry, Olympia, Nicki, Hannibal, and Pax move to the isolated Mexican village of Santa Tia, where they can live in peace.

Amelia runs into the ocean and swims away. Four years later, Levi finally makes it to Rarotonga, where he finds Amelia living in a hut on the beach with their daughter Charity.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Cruelly subverted in the _Monk_ episode "Mr. Monk and the Bad Girlfriend". Captain Stottlemeyer had intended to take his girlfriend Linda on a trip to Hawaii to propose, instead she's arrested for murdering her real estate partner. Stottlemeyer goes to Hawaii, but ends up giving Linda's ticket to Lieutenant Disher. The episode ends with Disher asking Stottlemeyer if Linda was just using the Captain all along; meanwhile Stottlemeyer throws the engagement ring he bought for Linda into the ocean.

-   In _Stargate SG-1_, Harry Maybourne spends some time like this after being pardoned of his earlier treasonous activity, though he eventually ends up opting for an off-planet exile instead.
-   In the _Sherlock_ episode "The Great Game", one of the crimes that Moriarty arranges and subsequently has Sherlock expose is a character's plan to do this.
-   As perhaps evidenced by the theme song, _Red Dwarf_'s Lister dreams of getting back to Earth and setting up a burger bar on Fiji with his cat. Technically speaking, this is the Series Goal of the whole program - if only because the main characters are so hopelessly screwed that no-one can come up with a better plan.
-   In _Due South_ this is a Discussed Trope. The villain, in a standoff with Fraser, brags that he'll soon be in Tahiti living off his spoils.
-   _Farscape_ appears to do this. At the end of the final episode, John and Aeryn are on a boat in very tropical-looking waters, he asks her to marry him, and it looks like a perfect setup for a Happily Ever After ending. Then an alien ship appears from nowhere and blasts them to pieces. The subsequent miniseries shoves them right back into the war.
-   An episode of _Grimm_ involves a congregation of Seelengut (sheep people) being led by an, apparently, reformed Blutbad reverend (that's right, a wolf preaching to sheep), who is secretly stealing from the church along with his Seelengut wife.

-   One _Midsomer Murders_ episode ends with the murderers getting away with it because the woman in their Menage A Trois refuses to cooperate, enduring jail for their sake.

-   Season 2 of _Money Heist_ (the show's original ending) has Raquel reunite with the Professor in Palawan, Philippines.

    Music 

-   Jimmy Buffett's song "Banana Republic" is about precisely this sort of person — "expatriated Americans, hoping to find some fun." Buffett in general likes to present himself as such - the fact that he's extremely wealthy means it is some degree of Truth in Television for him.
-   Subverted in the Zac Brown Band song "Toes", where everything is great for the tourist... until he runs out of money.
    -   Another song of theirs, _Knee Deep,_ is perhaps a slightly more successful example.
-   The Twist Ending of Rammstein's "Haifisch" video.
-   The Karma Houdini Villain Protagonist of _Mister Bad Example_ does this twice. First, he flies to Adelaide with a Monte Carlo prostitute's stolen passport, then to Sri Lanka on a Malaysian Air flight he paid for with stolen wages from his Australian opal mining company.
-   Dire Straits' "Twisting By The Pool" is about the fun things the singer expects to do on vacation in a beach resort.
-   Wall of Voodoo: Stan Ridgway (in his solo after the split) sings of the taxi driver who dreams of this trope, being together with the bank robber woman who hijacked his car as a getaway. No such luck - "Drive She Said"!

    Podcasts 

-   Episode 246 of the _Comedy Bang! Bang!_ podcast had Bob Odenkirk jokingly saying that this was how _Breaking Bad_ would end.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The "Lost and Found" adventure in _GURPS Discworld Also_ states that, in accordance with the Theory of Narrative Causality, the Howondaland trading post _must_ contain at least one white-suited Ankh-Morporkian expat, who can never return for some unspecified reason.

    Theatre 

-   _Deckchairs_ by Jean McConnell is a collection of one-act plays that are all designed so they can be performed with two actors and a couple of deckchairs. One of them, "Last Post", ends with a con artist sitting in a deckchair somewhere tropical enjoying the proceeds of her latest scam.

    Video Games 

-   _Banjo-Kazooie_ features an ending sequence with our heroes relaxing on a tropical island somewhere.
-   _Illbleed_'s good ending shows all the heroes (who have just won a ton of money at the titular Amusement Park of Doom) lounging on a beach together.
-   Possibly that easter egg Fanservice picture in _Gauntlet Legends_.
-   If the player amasses a tidy sum as an independent commander in _MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries,_ they will get an ending of their character relaxing on the deck of a yacht in a tropical sea with a drink in one hand and a ring with a _huge_ jewel on the other after the Battle of Tukayyid cutscene.
-   _Crash Bandicoot_:
    -   _Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back_: The trope turns up as the bad ending; Crash and Coco sit on a beach with one of the crabs from the first game, and discuss what happened to the Cortex Vortex. The good ending, which is unlocked via 100% Completion, has them and N. Brio destroy the Cortex Vortex, but the weapon they use for that is in the jungle instead.
    -   _Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped_: Suggested by Dr. Neo Cortex in the bad ending of the game as an idea of what to do now that he's been beaten yet again, shortly before his boss, UkaUka reminds him they could still triumph by getting all the gems. The good ending, unlockable via 100% Completion, has instead the villains trapped in a past era after their time machine goes haywire.
-   More of a Tropical Prologue, unless you count it for the previous game, but the PC title 7.62: High Calibre begins with your mercenary crew lounging on a beach before getting the call to action.
-   _Rock Band 3_ plays this straight after you complete the tour modus. Your band presumably dies in a plane crash while they really just faked their deaths to escape stardom and enjoy their wealth in some tropical paradise.
-   If you lose the game _Mario's Time Machine_, then Bowser will do this.
-   _Bad Mojo_ ends with the protagonist and his long lost father using a bunch of stolen money to retire to the Caribbean.
-   Discussed between Commander Shepard and Garrus in _Mass Effect 3_, and Zaeed will ultimately be shown enjoying his retirement as such assuming he survived the events of the game. Depicting the entire crew in this setting seems to be a pervasive theme for dozens of pieces of fan art in an effort to fix the controversial ending.
-   In _Max Payne 3_, the last scene is one of Max, having both successfully kicked his alcoholism and brought down Victor Branco's conspiracy, drinking a soda and watching a Coincidental Broadcast about Victor's death at a beach in Bahia, at peace with himself for the first time in a long time.
-   A Non Standard Game Over for _Rayman 2: The Great Escape_ has Rayman accept a ton of money instead of the Plot Coupon and living life in a tropical paradise surrounded by money.
-   Inverted in _Super Mario Sunshine_: Mario spends most of the game on a tropical island... under arrest for a crime he didn't commit. It's only at the end of the game that he's finally released and gets to vacation there like he wanted.
-   _Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego?_: If the player loses by capturing the wrong member of V.I.L.E., the game ends by showing the acquitted villain enjoying a tropical vacation.
-   Throughout _Red Dead Redemption II_, Dutch Van der Linde _claims_ that this is the end-goal the Gang is working towards; one big score of money that will be enough to get the whole group on a boat to Tahiti, where they can live out their lives away from government control. As the game progresses, however, it becomes clear this is a naive pipe-dream at best, a lie he uses to maintain control of his gang at worst, and every heist intended to round up the necessary funds ends in disastrous failure. Tellingly, the player can (and probably will) earn more than enough money to charter a boat through mundane side quests, yet Dutch never even discusses leaving unless it's in the context of preparing for a huge heist.
-   At the end of _Oddworld: Soulstorm_, Molluck goes into hiding after being scapegoated by the rest of the Glukkons for the havoc Abe's revolution has caused, and he is last seen heading off to the Yayman Islands, accompanied by the battalion of sligs he's coaxed to his side. Lampshaded in the epilogue, with a newspaper questioning the wisdom of hiding from the authorities in _a popular tourist location_.

    Visual Novels 

-   The High School Sweetheart Ending of _Melody_ starts this way, with the protagonist and Isabella relaxing on the beach together.

    Webcomics

    Web Video 

-   Discussed in _Epic Rap Battles of History_: in "James Bond vs Austin Powers," Bond complains that the battle against Powers is a waste of time and that he'd rather be vacationing on the beach.
    
    **James Bond:** I can't believe I'm wasting my time with this clown  
    I should be on an island with a fucking model by now  
    Sipping dry martinis and peeling off bikinis  
    Not rapping against Swedish-penis-pumping weenies!
    

    Western Animation 

-   At least two _Looney Tunes_ shorts "Ali Baba Bunny" and "The Abominable Snow Rabbit" end with Bugs Bunny lounging on the beach at wherever he was going before missing that fateful "left turn at Albuquerque" (Pismo Beach in the former short, Palm Springs in the latter). "Mutiny On the Bunny" ends with Yosemite Sam rowing Bugs to Rio in a rowboat, the latest part of a promised trip around the world.
    -   In the Compilation Movie _Daffy Duck's Quackbusters_, Bugs keeps asking to go to Palm Springs. Guess where he is in the "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue?
-   An episode of _Batman: The Animated Series_ titled "The Worry Men" features the Mad Hatter admitting that he's been thinking of retiring from crime, purchasing an island out in the middle of nowhere, and opening up a sun-bonnet shop. Of course, as even little islands cost a lot of money, he decided to put his criminal talents to use in one last big job to fund the dream.
