"You look lovely this evening. Have you decreased in mass?"

_"An especially enjoyable biological howler was the notion, common on pulp magazine covers, that aliens would lust after human women, especially if partially unclad, this being on par with men lusting after squids."_

— **The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction** (1995 edition) entry on _Scientific Errors_

Apparently, the hottest thing in the Multiverse, above even the Cute Monster Girl and Green-Skinned Space Babe, is the Human Female. This is one of the reasons humans think Aliens Are Bastards.

Sooner or later, no matter what the species looks like, you'll find a sample of the male that prefers human girls. It can be an alien, a swamp monster, a robot, a Non-Human Sidekick, or even a giant gorilla. (Sometimes it Was Once a Man, which makes the attraction less implausible.) Note that this is usually played straight, while the inverse is almost always played for laughs. Also, the male non-human is far more likely to actually get the human girl.

Biologically, this is completely insane. Imagine a human in the real world falling in love with a squid<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and you'll see why. Of course, squids don't have that kind of complexity, which may be the difference here — you can't see past their looks to their "nice personality". But Most Writers Are Human and Male. It's more plausible with Rubber-Forehead Aliens and other Humanoid Aliens, however, since they look enough like humans and vice versa for there to be an attraction. Regardless, this often results in Half-Human Hybrids. This, however, is equally biologically insane; you'd have a better chance getting knocked up by a _tree_, since you and the tree are at least _from the same planet_. Then again, having Human Aliens and Rubber-Forehead Aliens is just as big a case of Artistic License – Biology to begin with, so interbreeding with humans wouldn't be too big a leap from there.

Named after the infamous 1967 B-Movie _Mars Needs Women_. That this trope was popularized in 1950s and '60s monster movies is no coincidence. Considering the racial context of the time, this trope is a close cousin to the antiquated belief that Scary Black Men are always trying to steal white women. Which is itself a variation on the ancient tribal warfare trope of "They're invading, and they want our women/men!" While that version is a Discredited Trope, the more general "non-humanoid character attracted to a girl" is not.

Very rarely, the species either culturally values the idea of human slave concubines, or is so sterile or depopulated that this is the only means they have of avoiding extinction.

On the rare occasions that Venus Needs Men, the Venusians will almost always be sexy, scantily clad, and conforming to local norms of beauty (unless the joke is that they're abhorrent admirers to human men). But it's not always desirable, as there are _lots_ of examples in fiction where female aliens just Conceive and Kill, instead of kidnapping.

Compare Boldly Coming, Face Full of Alien Wing-Wong, Interspecies Romance, and Monster Misogyny. Contrast with Humans Are Ugly. See also Beast and Beauty and Touch of the Monster (for how this is typically shown in a movie poster).

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Aquarion Evol_, the humans of Altair Kai use their Abductors to kidnap Vegan females. They do so in hopes of avoiding extinction, because an illness known as the Curse of Eve has wiped out all the females on their planet.
-   _Aoi House_ features a panty-obsessed (presumably non-sapient) hamster.
-   _Blue Drop_:
    -   It is indicated that the Arume want to conquer Earth since the fact that they only consist of women causes troubles for them in the long run, despite their technical prowess. Still they chase earth _women_ and even interbreed with them. Obviously, old habits are hard to break.
    -   The second series, _Blue Drop: Tenshi no Bokura_, explains that at least one of the reasons for the invasion of Earth was that in the past the male Arume visited Earth, crossbred, and left their DNA behind in the human genome. They were trying to recover the male Arume that had died out long ago by breeding with human _men_, making it somewhat a gender inversion — except that at least some of the now female only Arume seem to like the whole lesbian status quo a bit too much and violently oppose attempts to restore the male Arume. To summarize, Mars _needs_ men, but it _wants_ women.
    -   It also shows them more or less raising human girls to be sex slaves, with nightly orgies in their all-girls schools. This can come off as nightmarish even to the Girl on Girl Is Hot crowd.
-   In Osamu Tezuka's _Cleopatra (1970)_, the perverted leopard Lupa tries multiple times to mate with Cleopatra and Lybia who are both human.
-   _Digimon Adventure_: Mimi, a conventionally attractive human girl, has a tendency of being hit on by creatures that one would not expect to have any interest in an upright primate, such as the sluglike Numemon, the living turd Sukamon and the ratlike Chuumon.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_: Discussed in the Saiyan Saga. When they see how powerful Saiyan-human hybrids like Gohan are, Nappa suggests to Vegeta that they conquer the Earth, then mate with the human women to breed a race of powerful warriors who he calls "Super Saiyans".<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Vegeta shoots the idea down on the grounds that it would be stupid to breed a race of warriors that would one day be more powerful than they are. Ironically, two sagas later, Vegeta eventually marries one himself and eventually has two very powerful hybrid children.
-   In _Genma Wars_, human girls are highly sought by the Genma since we occasionally see a few taking them as concubines. The Maoh King, the demonic ruler of Earth, regularly orders his servants to bring him women and girls so he can mate with them whether they like it or not, much to his wife Parome's irritation. Its later revealed that this is part of an Super Breeding Program to produce greater and even more powerful Genma to provoke never-ending conflict on Earth because Dystopia Justifies the Means.
-   _The Girl Who Leapt Through Space_ has the pairing of Akiha, a human girl, and Leopard, a Master Computer with a superiority complex. They're close to having Belligerent Sexual Tension in execution.
-   Similarly to _The Girl Who Leapt Through Space_ (it's by the same studio), Imber, a 50-ton Humongous Mecha in _Idolmaster: Xenoglossia_, is deeply in love with Haruka, who is both a human girl and his pilot. Haruka is in love with him too, so this goes both ways.
-   In _Goblin Slayer_, all goblins are male so they kidnap females, mostly elves and humans, in order to breed and they keep them alive until they can no longer give birth any more.
-   In _Inuyasha_ and its sequel _Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon_, demons and half-demons have a general contempt for humans, yet numerous demon and half-demon characters are attracted to one of them, including Inu no Taishō, Inuyasha, Kouga, and eventually Sesshomaru.
-   Part Three of _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ has Forever the Orangutan (who wearing a Captain's uniform and smokes a pipe) looking at a "Playboy-esque" magazine, making gross eyes at human girl, and generally acting like a dirty old man. Indeed, several real-life native cultures have stories about apes, and there are less exaggerated stories of orangutans habituated or raised by humans getting unusually handsy.
-   Kir on _King of Bandit Jing_, who hits on every single Girl of the Week, and was constantly rebuffed. Oddly enough, this seemed to be more about his personality and choice of words, and not the fact that he's a _bird_.
-   In _Kujibiki♡Unbalance_, the alien males all look like tiny little green things while the women are all beautiful well-developed women. According to the show, the females find the males really attractive.
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (2016)_, King Bulblin has a Villainous Crush on the human Ilia despite being an orc-like creature.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_:
    -   Weasel Mascot Chamo shows a rather healthy appreciation for the female form. This is one reason readers are confused whether he was a human turned into an ermine, or an ermine (spirit) to begin with.
    -   As Asuna fight some demons, they're pleased to discover that she's not wearing panties (While Asuna herself was immune to a petrification spell she got hit with earlier, her outfit wasn't so lucky). Asuna doesn't take it so well.
-   _Outlaw Star_ has the Silgrians, a race of bird-like people that _as a whole_, seem to like humans _way_ too much. They were just one of the only species that were really accepting of humans. A really friendly bunch them, albeit a bit too friendly.
-   The same thing happened in _Ranma ½_ except with the male Armie/Do-chan, who was just a huge pervert. It would rather become a skin-tight suit of Powered Armor (that ripped its owner's clothing to shreds while doing so, natch) than do anything sexual _to_ them. It even rejected female Ranma when "she" got too aggressive.
-   _Re:Monster_ has a similar set-up. Although female goblins exist, males have a higher conception rate with human women and will kidnap them for breeding purposes.
-   _Sgt. Frog_: The small froglike alien Giroro has a crush on human Natsumi that borders on obsession at times. In a reversal of this trope, human alien Angol Moa has a crush on Keroro.
-   More Equal Opportunity: Ryo-Ohki from _Tenchi Muyo!_ seems to like Tenchi as much as the girls in the harem do. Of course, she also happens to have a Cute Monster Girl form, too.
    -   Fuku the cabbit from _Tenchi Muyo! GXP_ doesn't have a Cute Monster Girl form, though, and the series is rather unequivocal about numbering her in the Unwanted Harem during the big wedding sequence. It's a little disturbing watching everyone talk about it so cheerfully... (Washuu did mention earlier that she'd get one eventually — it is still weird, though.)
-   _TerraforMARS_: The Martian cavemen roaches are known to gang up on human women and... rip them apart for no real reason if there's no other threats to deal with. However, an organization called We Are The Cosmos feeds them information on how to fight the Annex I squad and how to pilot the Bugs I ship for an invasion of Earth. With their support, the roach leader known as the Invoker oversees an underground laboratory where humans are bred for experimentation. Only then, out of a morbid Goal-Oriented Evolution mindset, do the roaches force humans to bear Half-Human Hybrids with the same Omnicidal Maniac behaviour as them.
-   _Tokyo Ghoul_: Hooguro has a thing for human women, in spite of being a member of the Anti-Human Alliance, Aogiri Tree.
-   _×××HOLiC_: Watanuki has something about him that draws supernatural creatures dangerously close to him. While most of them just want to eat him (there was a massive scramble just for his _eye_), there are some like the Zashiki-warashi and _especially_ Mugetsu who want him in _that_ way.

    Comic Books 

-   Rather frighteningly and repeatedly mentioned (though not shown) in the second arc of _The Authority_ — the Blue, an alien race who came to a parallel Earth and began interbreeding with humans centuries ago, eventually took over the planet and turned China, among other places, into a rape camp to try and father more offspring, because they actually did need women. Then they try to expand their territory into the Authority's Earth. This is a mistake.
-   Fone Bone of Jeff Smith's _Bone_, one of a race of short, bald, cartoony, big-nosed, bone-white creatures that resemble nothing so much as animated blobs of marshmallow, develops a crush on the thoroughly human woman Thorn. Thankfully, or sadly, it never goes anywhere. It is hinted that Fone Bone gets into "girl problems" back in Boneville often so it isn't just Thorn.
-   In _Empowered_, Emp is captured by a galactic "Pimpotron" who is going to kidnap her for "erotiservitude." She is discarded because her butt is outside the required size range... a definite proof that bureaucracy is bad in bed. He says that this was the fate of Amelia Earhart as well.
-   Fred Perry's _Gold Digger_ once again plays Equal Opportunity with this trope: When the villain Fauntleroy acquires powerful living armor, he discovers that the armor in question is not only _female_, but pretty damn horny, too. She's just as likely to _hump_ his shoulder as she is to sit on it.
-   In one issue of _Green Lantern Corps_ (pre-Parallax), a huge fleet of ship appears in the skies of the severely overpopulated world of Malthus, which is under the protection of Guy Gardner.
    
    "People of Malthus! Our world was devastated in the Crisis, and your ability to breed is legendary! Palomaris needs women!"  
    
    -   Guy destroys the entire fleet. The entire _unarmed_ fleet. They'd apparently come looking for volunteers.
-   _Hack/Slash_: The Old Gods cannot create, only corrupt and destroy. They need virgin human females to propagate their species. This is what they use the virgins that SixSixx provides them through the Virgin Sacrifice that his part of his Deal with the Devil.
-   In the erotic comic _Ironwood_, dragons are all male, or more precisely asexual in their natural forms and shapeshift into human males in order to seduce human women for the perpetuation of the species. Apparently they enjoy this so much, the rest of their time is mostly spent hunting down most dragon-offspring they can find to prevent extreme overpopulation.
-   Very oddly played with in a classic _Uncle Scrooge_ comic. He got in a fight with the post office about them delivering someone else's mail to him by mistake, and the postmaster general just gave him his job to shut him up. (Why the head of a multi-fantasticalillion dollar global empire would accept a public services job is never explained). He finds the job simple enough, until he gets a letter from a 10 foot tall teenager to be delivered to the world authority on Venus. On his second trip (he accidentally went to Mars on his first — no-one let the irony escape him), he arrives to and finds that the planet is inhabited exclusively by 10 foot tall teenage girls (Mars, on the other hand, being occupied by scaly green winged letterboxes).
-   Subverted in the _Mars Attacks!_ Image Comics, where a Martian scientist overseeing the forced insemination of a captured superheroine is disgusted that there were volunteers for such "bestiality" and skeptical that it will actually produce functional hybrids.
-   Given an amusing nod in _Ultimate Marvel_'s "Ultimate Galactus Trilogy" series; Hawkeye, Iron Man and a few others have sneaked onboard a (alien) Kree ship, being aided by Mar-Vell, a Kree Defector from Decadence. Hawkeye easily kills a group of guards, to Mar-Vell's annoyance:
    
    **Mar-Vell:** Remind me again why I defected?  
    **Iron Man:** Was it human girls?
    
-   _ROM: Spaceknight_: One of Hybrid's goals is to create more Dire-wraith hybrids like himself by establishing rape camps with mutant women. In his debut, he tries to kidnap Shadowcat during the confusion of the X-Men's fight with Rom. In a later story, Hybrid's alliance with a group of female mutant villains is undone when the hero reveals that Hybrid plans to turn them into breeding stock. In _Avengers Academy_, he's expanded his field of interest by planning to use _all_ of the girls for his sick purposes.
-   A story in Warren Publishing's 1984 magazine features this trope in the story "Scourge from the Spaceways", where it is revealed that females are unique to humanity. As a result, an interstellar war is triggered as the entire universe fights over Earth's women.
-   In the first volume of the series _Sillage_, human woman Nävis' beauty is appreciated by one of the aliens she's come into contact with. She is the first and only human they've ever seen.
-   _Street Fighter vs. Darkstalkers_: In one short story, Laura Matsuda is kidnapped by fish man Rikuo to create a whole new kingdom with their offspring after she challenges him to a fight and gets defeated. She doesn't mind it very much, due to finding him "curiously attractive for a fish man".
-   Inverted in _Warlord of Mars_ where the female lead is an Martian whose love interest is a human (albeit a very unusual one) and _she_ is the one coveted by aliens of different species (some normally so xenophobic they would consider her a beast). It's worth pointing out she looks significantly human and is extremely attractive by our standards. This trope is subverted in the crossover with Barbarella where she is caught by a giant alien squid (who goes as far as wrapping his tentacles around her body) and fears that it will turn her into a broodmother. Turns out the monster is friendly and as Barbarella points out, they don't have the necessary reproductory systems for this trope.

    Fan Works 

-   Alien Prince Grulleo from _To-Love-Death_ wants to marry princess Lala, too bad he doesn't take kindly to rejection.
-   Played with in this fanfic, where it becomes "Venus Needs Women!"
-   Nearly every _Alien_, _Predator_, or combination thereof fanfiction that has romance as on of its main genre-slots has a human female shacking up with a Predator male or occasionally an Alien male, resulting in some truly disturbing and sometimes arousing love scenes.
-   The Kirby fanfic series _Libra And Gemini_ has Fecto Elfilis falling in love with Vesa Krasniqi, a human test subject who befriended them in Lab Discovera.
-   The _MLP_ fanfic "I Dream of Luna" has nearly every single pony in the story chasing after a man named Anonymous.
    -   In fact, although his role in stories can vary wildly from this to Abhorrent Admirer or even Humanoid Abomination, stories on 4Chan's /mlp/ board have had pretty much every mare (and most of the _stallions_) finding themselves unbelievably attracted to "Anon" who's often completely oblivious to it.
-   In the Zee Rust future of _Plan 7 of 9 from Outer Space_ women are actually choosing to emigrate to Mars because they're unemployed due to their husbands preferring SexBots and Robot Maids. This is causing tension between the two worlds because female Martians are angry at the competition while male humans believe thanks to unimaginative sci-fi movies that "aliens had nothing better to do than conquer planets and impregnate their women with carnivorous offspring." As a result Martian investigator TuMok has to team up with Captain Proton to investigate when a Robot Monster starts abducting women for real. The trope is lampshaded in "Village of the Spammed".
    
    "Has your husband replaced you with Robo-Bimbo?" asked a handsome Martian holo-projected across the entire hemisphere. "Tired of Earthmen with their puny mental powers? Well don't despair because Mars Needs Women!"
    
-   _Rocketship Voyager_ is _Star Trek: Voyager_ rewritten as a 1950's sci-fi pulp, so this trope inevitably comes up.
    -   Played for laughs when a flashback shows TuV'k as a Former Teen Rebel on Mars, lusting after a Terran student and wearing a floaterbike jacket emblazoned with the words _Mars Needs Women_.
    -   Played for drama when the Caretaker has a young Terran girl kept in suspended animation in a People Jar, and demands another Terran female "of fertile age" in payment for sending _Voyager_ back to Earth. Captain Janeway's response is to Mercy Kill the girl on the spot. Unfortunately that means she has to hand herself over to the Caretaker in exchange to get her crew home.
-   A possibility hinted at by _Signs of Snow_, in which Andoria is currently living a fertility crisis because of their Bizarre Alien Sexes — they need four people of a different gender each and to wait for the incubating one to be fertile before trying for a kid. As shown by Lily Evans, a human female is fertile every month and easily can serve as the surrogate.
-   _Vow of Nudity_: Everything, male or female, seems to find Haara a desirable sex partner. So far she's been intimate with multiple demons, a dragon, a bullywug, a tentacle monster, a water elemental, and most of the playable races in D&D.

    Film — Animated 

-   One of the short stories in _Heavy Metal_ centers around a Pentagon secretary being abducted by aliens and the sex robot that falls in love with her. Judging from the following quote, this trope is pretty common in that 'verse:
    
    **Edsel:** Whoa, typical robot. First Earth chick we see in ten years, and he's gotta make a play for her.
    
-   This trope forms the basis of _Mars Needs Moms_. Referenced right in the title. Though in this case it's their ability to raise children, rather than conceive them, that matters to the Martians.
-   In _Monsters vs. Aliens_, it's mentioned that Link abducted 250 co-eds before he was eventually caught.
-   Jiminy Cricket of _Pinocchio_ seems to have a fascination with human-ish women: from fairies to marionettes to music box ornaments shaped like 'em, but he is pretty damn human-ish himself, to the point of not even being immediately recognizable as any sort of anthropomorphic insect.
-   In _The Super Mario Bros. Movie_, Bowser is a Koopa (a kind of turtle) whose attraction to Peach, a human, is more than a little creepy not only because of their differing species but also because of the fact that he wants to force her to marry him. This is dialed up in the Japanese version, where he explicitly states that he wants to marry her so she'll bear his children.
-   Against her will, Thumbelina is very popular with other species.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Battlefield Earth_ also inverts the trope, as Terl agrees that he thinks Johnny's mate is "the most repulsive female I've ever seen," which is odd, because the only differences between Psychlos and humans are height, fingers, tongue, and dreads.
-   The whole premise of 1986's _Breeders_. Exploitation at it's sleaziest.
-   _The Brain from Planet Arous_: Justified — Gor, possessing a human body, wants to get horizontal with his host's fiancée because he wants to indulge _all_ the possible senses; being a disembodied brain, having _any_ sensation at all is a novelty.
-   Gillman in _Creature from the Black Lagoon_ kidnaps human women twice because, as the Last of His Kind, he's pretty lonely. Thankfully it never goes past The Screaming stage once they're rescued.
-   This trope is played straight in _Dagon_, which is a loose retelling of _The Shadow Over Innsmouth_ set in the present day, and with the sleazy angle of this trope heavily emphasized over the relatively chaste source material.
-   Dean Koontz's _Demon Seed_, a film about Proteus Four, a Master Computer, imprisoning a woman in her home so that she can bear his child/avatar. In the film he does this only through necessity, while in the book he confesses to being in love with her.
-   _Earth Girls Are Easy_ is a comedy based on this trope. When the three furry aliens are given a makeover, however, they resemble date-worthy guys — where in star Julie Brown's original '50s-esque song, the alien is slimy, bug-eyed, and looks "like a cross between Flipper and Alan Thicke".
-   In _The Erotic Rites of Frankenstein_, Cagliostro’s plan for the Monster is to send him out to capture the most beautiful virgins across the land. From there Cagliostro will take the best parts of each woman and piece them together to create the perfect female specimen. Once the perfect woman is complete, Cagliostro will force her to mate with Frankenstein’s Monster to create a super race.
-   _Galaxy Quest_: Parodied in a Deleted Scene. When Jason Nesmith and Gwen DeMarco are attempting to shut down the reactor, they are held up by two of Sarris' men. One of them is strangely attracted to Gwen, which disgusts the other one, who claims that he'd sooner mate with an animal. ("Yes... I _know_.") Gwen is disgusted by the first one's attraction — and pissed off at the second one's insult, so she makes the ship's computer squash them underneath a blast door. In that deleted scene, she shows off her cleavage to distract one of them.
-   The Golem of Prague in the silent movie _The Golem_ temporarily shows a fascination with his creator's beautiful daughter Miriam, though he soon loses interest.
-   _Gremlins 2: The New Batch_: Gender inverted. Greta, a female gremlin, develops a crush on Forster, a male human, and eventually marries him. That said, Forster is only _initially_ repulsed by Greta and, in the end when she approaches him in the dress, he basically shrugs "why not?" and goes with it.
-   _Half Human_: The snowman abducts a female researcher near the end of the film. This is _not_ Played for Laughs; the other characters realize that, having just lost his child, the snowman _wants to father a child_, regardless of the woman's opinion on the matter.
-   _Horrific_: In _Terror Vision_, the giant eye comes from a parthenogenic race. However, because it crossed into our dimension through a male host, it now needs human females to propagate its race.
-   _Howard the Duck_, as in the comic, establishes Howard and Bev as a romantic couple.
-   _I Married a Monster from Outer Space_ is a 1958 SF movie where aliens are replacing human men in a desperate attempt to perpetuate the species as their females all died out. One of the aliens (the husband of the protagonist) does say that they've been working on making interbreeding possible. _IMaMFOS_ is also rare in that the aliens are rather sympathetic, especially as compared to the Jerkass local guys who keep refusing to marry their girlfriends, preferring to spend all their time drinking and whoring... though they have _also_ kidnapped various women's husbands to breed with their wives and are much poorer partners than those they replace.
-   _King Kong (1933)_ is, of course, one of the most famous examples of this. "'Twas beauty that killed the beast." It's ambiguous how much of Kong's interest in Ann is sexual, though. The 2005 version, for example, plays the whole thing very chastely - more like the relationship between the sign-language gorilla Koko and her pet kittens.
-   In _Kiss Me Quick!_, Sterilox is sent to Earth to secure a perfect specimen of womanhood who can be used to engender a servant race for the Buttless Galaxy.
-   The Beast in _Krull_, a giant, reptilian monster, has conquered many worlds but wishes to be wed to the human princess Lyssa.
-   _Mars Attacks!_: While they are not really interested in mating with Earth women, the Martians do show perverted sides to them. The leader enjoys porn magazines like Playboy, and they spy on a couple having sex.
-   _Mars Needs Women_, starring former Mouseketeer Tommy Kirk and Yvonne Craig, is the Trope Namer. Thanks to a recession in the Y chromosome, Martian men outnumber Martian women 100-to-1, so an expedition is sent to Earth to abduct five women and turn them into Human Popsicles for transport back to Mars as Breeding Slaves. Given that the Martians are Human Aliens it's more plausible than usual, and if they had just made a public appeal for female volunteers to immigrate to their planet the whole thing would have gone more smoothly.
-   _Men in Black_ has some fun with this when the bug-alien kidnaps the Damsel in Distress and drags her into his spaceship... because he might need a snack on the way back to his planet!
    -   _Men in Black: International_ plays it straight but makes it gender-inverted, as to make fun of Chris Hemsworth (who plays Agent H)'s reputation as a heartthrob. At the beginning of the film he sleeps with a reptilian-looking woman, then is fawned upon a female alien MIB agent with psychic powers and is revealed to have been in a relationship with an intergalactic arms dealer, who looks like a human woman but with three arms and weird hair coloring.
-   _Progeny_ has a setup like this, though making use of the more common reports of artificial insemination via alien technology. Which is then horribly subverted when it's revealed this is just A Form You Are Comfortable With, the entire "ship" is one creature.
-   The famously awful B-Movie _Robot Monster_ actually acknowledges the weirdness of this trope — Ro-Man's attraction to the human girl Alice shocks him, and he spends much of the film trying to work out why he feels that way. When he fails to understand it, and his master orders him to kill Alice, Ro-Man's mind falls apart, and he is reduced to constantly muttering "I must... but I cannot..."
-   In _Rubber_, a living car tire with deadly psychic powers comes to have a strange obsession with an attractive female motorist. At one point the police have her chastise the tire for "his" sexual fixation.
-   In _Scarecrow Slayer_, Dave's soul is sucked into the body of a demonic scarecrow when he is shot and killed. The Scarecrow then kidnaps Dave's girlfriend Mary, planning to transform her into a scarecrow and make her his bride.
-   Guillermo del Toro made _The Shape of Water_ to deconstruct this trope, as he said he saw the _Creature from the Black Lagoon_ as a kid and felt sorry for the creature. Thus in his movie (which is almost an unofficial sequel) the attraction is mutual — although there are hints that the heroine might not be fully human herself.
-   In _Spaceballs_, Barf, the half man, half dog "I'm my own best friend", seems to like human women. But then that's not really surprising, as he appears 99% human, and we all know dogs hump people's legs anyway.
-   _Star Trek: Generations_:
    -   Subverted in one example:
        
        **Lursa:** Human females are so _repulsive_!
        
    -   Although when Soran punches one of the Klingon sisters for nearly getting him killed, she jokingly suggests that he may have been initiating a courtship.
-   _Star Trek (2009)_:
    -   Played straight and inverted. Kirk was seen in bed with a Green-Skinned Space Babe and said to have not-even-human_oid_ conquests under his belt.
    -   There's also Spock's human mother and alien father, although Vulcans are basically just humans with pointy ears anyway.
-   Jabba the Hutt's apparent sexual desire to chain scantily-clad human and humanoid females to him, as seen in _Return of the Jedi_.
    -   The Expanded Universe has an inversion, however. Female Twi'leks are considered sexually attractive to males of most humanoid species — especially human men. Zeltrons are less famously so, but those who know of them tend to think they're even better, partially due to their use of pheromones and a more humanlike skin tone. Twi'lek girls, in fact, frequently find themselves on the wrong end of this trope despite not being human. Everyone in the _Star Wars_ galaxy needs Twi'lek women.
    -   The EU also establishes that Jabba keeps the dancers in order to show 'lesser' species that he can have what they want, even when he doesn't want them himself. There's also speculation that he really _is_ interested in them... and this suspicion makes other Hutts view him as being a sexual deviant.
    -   Played for laughs in one episode of _The Clone Wars_, where a group of Hutts are enjoying a performance by a group of Twi'lek dancers... but the headliner (and only one shown to have had an actual relationship with a Hutt) is Sy Snootles, who is only vaguely humanoid.
-   _Terror from the Year 5000_ features a human female from a post-apocalyptic world going back in time to find an uncontaminated man to bring back to her own time for breeding purposes. Radiation has made the human race pretty ugly by the year 5000, so the female has to disguise her appearance by ripping the face off of a nurse and wearing it over her own.
-   _Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen_ has Wheelie describe Mikaela Banes as "hot" and he even attempts to hump her leg later in the film. The film takes this trope one step further, too, as Wheelie is not only an alien from another planet, but also a mechanical lifeform.
-   _What Planet Are You From?_ has a One-Gender Race of Human Aliens who decide to get to Earth in order to impregnate a woman and bring the child back to their planet.
-   The 1908 silent film _When the Man in the Moon Seeks a Wife_ by the Clarendon Company was probably the first example of this in alien form, making the filmed version Older Than They Think.

    Literature 

-   E.E. Knight's _Age of Fire_ novel series has (male) Western dragons who find the scent and shape of human females alluring, seeing it as a strange compulsion whose farthest extent is apparently the source of the devouring-maidens myth, or, alternatively, keeping a bunch of hot female human servants around.
-   Isaac Asimov:
    -   "The Author's Ordeal": The girl is lusted after by the aliens because she is conventionally beautiful. The poem points out that this needs to be glossed over before the audience realizes that the aliens wouldn't care about her appearance.
        
        "Just the same you go fast till this section is passed so the reader won't raise any ruction, When recalling the foe are all reptiles and so have no interest in human seduction."
        
    -   Dr Asimov plays with this idea in his short story written for _Playboy_ magazine, originally tilted "Playboy and the Slime God" but then in anthology form renamed "What Is This Thing Called Love?" The slimey aliens are very weirded out by the whole sexual reproduction thing, and for research purposes, abduct a human man and woman (both married to others) to test this out. While there is no chance of interspecies coupling here, Asimov himself described that he was skewering this trope by showing how ridiculous it is to assume that aliens would have any interest in having sex with human women.
-   Artist Cireulo's coffee-table _Book of the Dragon_ conceives dragons as a species where females are extremely rare and beautiful female humanoids often become favoured servants and a source of companionship. Not to squick levels, though it's mentioned that a maiden sent to be devoured by a Water Dragon has often become the "Queen of his heart" instead.
-   In Edgar Rice Burroughs's _The Monster Men_, Number One abducts Virginia. To be sure, they were attempts to create actual men.
    -   Likewise, in his _The Land That Time Forgot_, the Weiroo tribe are an all-male race of Winged Humanoids with Psychic Powers who reproduce by forcing themselves upon the women of the Ga-Lu tribe, who are the most conventionally human-like (and thus attractive) of the Human Subspecies that populate Caprona.
    -   Zigzagged in the _John Carter of Mars_ series. Red, White, Black, and Yellow Martians are all human aliens, and the idea of them becoming attracted to each other — or, indeed, to humans — is presented as pretty normal. Indeed, Carter — a human — marries the Red princess Dejah Thoris and they even manage to have children. The one exception to this are the thoroughly-alien Green Martians, who are said to generally be disinterested in sex, beyond the perpetuation of their own species. It's therefore presented as _really weird_ — though narratively kind of inevitable — when the villainous Green chief Tal Hajus develops a rather rapey interest in Dejah Thoris.
-   In David Gerrold's _Chess With a Dragon_, the Earth is horrendously in debt to a galactic information-brokerage, and its leaders are desperate to find a way to pay it off. Unfortunately, other alien races will only assume Earth's debt in return for either strip-mining rights to the planet, or for millions of humans as slaves/food/hosts. One of the offers considered is a deal to hand over a mere several thousand humans, for payments that will significantly reduce Earth's debt ... but these aliens only want females. The aliens in question aren't exclusively interested in _human_ females: it's the same deal they offer to any sentient race that meets certain physiological parameters. The Earth's leadership turned this one down, and opted not to ask why the women were needed.
-   Justified in Brave Free Men by Jack Vance. It turns out that the alien Roguskhoi who rape human women and then leave them sterile once the new Roguskhoi is born were genetically engineered this way with the intention of ending the human race for their creators. And who are their creators? Figuring that one out and then going to the home planet of these creators in order to deal with them is completely the subject of the sequel.
-   _Conan the Barbarian_:
    -   In Robert E. Howard's story "Black Colossus", the Eldritch Abomination wants the princess. Then again, it Was Once a Man.
        
        _"But thou shalt be my queen, oh princess! I will teach thee the ancient forgotten ways of pleasure. We—" Before the stream of cosmic obscenity which poured from the shadowy colossus, Yasmela cringed and writhed as if from a whip that flayed her dainty bare flesh._
        
    -   In "Shadows in the Moonlight", Conan deduced the gray ape-man attacked out of lust for Olivia.
-   Averted in one of the _Dominic Flandry_ stories. A young woman wonders if a male nonhuman who has been very attentive to her is romantically interested in her; she then scolds herself for silliness, reminding herself how completely unattractive she must look from his viewpoint.
-   The draconians of the _Dragonlance_ universe originally had their female members remain unhatched, leading to a Justified Trope where they are attracted to female elves and humans as substitutes. However, when encountering female draconians in the book _Draconian Measures_ a group of male draconians has a member who comments that female draconians would be no fun because, as he tells his fellows, "Hugging them would be just like hugging one of you guys!"
-   Subverted in Joe Haldeman's novel _The Forever War_; a Mind Probe produced by the Earth military portrays Tauren soldiers raping human women with gigantic purple members, an entirely fanciful depiction as at the time the film is made nobody on Earth has the slightest idea what a Tauren looks like, in order to get the human soldiers angry enough to kill. The hero is aware that it is totally false but his subconscious makes his teeth start grinding in readiness to KILL! Ultimately they turn out to be an androgynous clone species who have no interest in human women.
-   _Gaea Trilogy_: Fat Fred, the Gaean "angel" from _Wizard_. His nickname stems not from his appearance, but from the fact that he's a bit of a Chubby Chaser. And as angels have next to no body fat (in order to be able to fly), even a fairly slim human woman is just his type by angelic standards.
-   Gender-reversed in Gary Ghislain's amusing YA novel _How I Stole Johnny Depps Alien Girlfriend_. Inhabitants of the all-female planet Vahalal periodically dispatch a beautiful/formidable 'Traveler' to Earth to bring back a male 'Chosen One', with or without his consent. The title reveals who the latest Traveler has set her sights on...
-   Inverted in _The Inverted World_. The human inhabitants of the City, due to a highly-skewed gender ratio, realize that the only way to keep the City's population up is to interbreed with the (apparently human) natives of the strange world they're trapped in. They thus begin bringing native women to the City to bear children — willingly or otherwise.
-   Robert Silverberg's "Ishmael In Love" is told from the perspective of a superintelligent dolphin in love with his trainer. Unlike most examples of this trope, he's actually surprised by this attraction and considers it unusual.
-   Explored in _Lilith's Brood_: Mars needs 'everybody.' Specifically, gene trader aliens who travel throughout the universe mixing their DNA with other species in order to create new, stronger breeds. In a twist, this makes them value life so much that they can't leave self-destructive humanity alone, even if it's what the humans want. Much of the conflict comes from humans being less than thrilled with this.
-   Comes up a few times in the works of H. P. Lovecraft. Generally, he has little interest in talking about the sex act itself, and is more interested in the idea of Half-Human Hybrids.
    -   In _The Shadow Over Innsmouth_, the Deep Ones — male _and_ female — are very eager to reproduce with humans. At the end, the narrator realizes he is descended from such a pairing himself, and fully embraces his Deep One heritage and decides to go live with them in the ocean.
    -   _The Dunwich Horror_ has Yog-Sothoth, an alien god monster, impregnating a human woman, though it seems unlikely there was ever any kind of sexual attraction involved on either end.
-   Gender Flipped in _The Occupation Saga_. Most aliens in the galaxy have many more females than males (polygyny is common even though most of them are matriarchal), and most of them find human males equivalently attractive to males of their own species. Couple that with the fact that the most likely alien a human will encounter is an off-duty Shil'vati soldier who is at most a couple years out of school, and a lot of Boldly Coming happens.
-   _Quozl_ has the alien settler species of the story, whom believe in frequent sex as a legitimate way of blowing off steam, find Humans quite attractive in an exotic way. Considering most Humans find the rabbit-like aliens quite cute looking, the feeling is usually mutual.
-   In _Raiders from the Rings_ by Alan E. Nourse, radiation in space destroys sperm with X chromosomes, so Spacers can only have male children. After a war between the Earth and the Spacers, Earth cuts off emigration, so if the Spacers don't want to die out, they have to periodically raid the Earth and kidnap brides for themselves. Keep in mind that the Spacers are fully human, so their attraction to human females is understandable. There is a very good scene where one of the captured women, who has up to this point resisted the abduction, is startled into understanding and almost sympathizing with it.
-   Treated quite soberly and gender-flipped in "A Rose for Ecclesiastes", in which all male Martians and most females have become sterile, not long before humans visit their world. Unusual in that the female who has an affair with a human linguist didn't realize he could impregnate her, and because her lover then has to talk the other Martians out of their prior resignation to extinction. How often does Mars have to be _convinced_ it needs women/men? <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   The almost-human aliens in _Saga of the Exiles_ can't breed with humans, though they enthusiastically have sex with them in every combination. But they use human women as surrogate mothers (their females have trouble carrying a foetus to term on Earth) to the point of wearing them out by constant pregnancies.
-   Subverted in _Spar_, a 2009 short story by Kij Johnson. After the destruction of her spacecraft, a human woman is trapped in a lifeboat with a Starfish Alien survivor, and they have squick-inducing sex simply because there's nothing else to do. Worse, she has no means of communicating with the alien, so never discovers if the act has any meaning for it; or even if she's having sex with a sentient alien at all and not just their equivalent of the houseplant.
-   The ultimate motivation of the fairies of Hy Brasil in "The Stones Are Hatching" is to kidnap human women and make them their wives, believing that due to the war there will be no men left to stop them.
-   Inverted in Terry Pratchett's _Strata_, in which male kung, a Humanoid Alien species, are so overwhelmingly sexy to human females that they must sometimes resort to physical force to discourage the more-susceptible women from trying to jump their bones in public.
-   Donald Tyson appears to have a fetish for this trope. His work of Lovecraftian metafiction, _Necronomicon: The Wanderings of Alhazred_ necessarily incorporates it when it mentions the Deep Ones and Yog-Sothoth, but he uses it even when it is not part of the original canon. For instance, Tyson's Alhazred claims that Nyarlathotep assumes his human form in order to mate with women, that the Yithians exchanged their minds with men to get at the women on Earth, and that Shub-Niggurath is similar to a hideous alien succubus.
-   In _Unlimited Fafnir_, the dragons seek out the (all-female with one exception) Ds as mates. They have the ability to "mark" Ds, which eventually transforms them into another of their own kind that they can reproduce with. This is because Vritra, one of the dragons, wants to create dragon-D hybrid offspring, who would eventually be capable of marking and transforming all of humanity into dragons.
-   Equal Opportunity again: _The Vanishing_ by Bentley Little centers around the modern descendants of 19th-century couplings between humans and a secret race of monsters who, despite being hideous 8 foot tall Mix-and-Match Critters who speak in Black Speech, have a practically supernatural sexual appeal that makes them irresistible to humans. As a result, they don't need to chase or abduct human women or men; the humans tend to seek them out, usually just for a quickie, but sometimes going on to abandon their families to go live amongst the monsters.
-   Myrddraal in _The Wheel of Time_ have this heavily implied in the text (confirmed by Word of God) fetish for kidnapping and raping human women. Logically, this makes little sense — Myrddraal can't produce viable offspring (the Black Magic corruption in them is too strong — on the off chance one _does_ get its victim pregnant, the child is always stillborn), they don't need to reproduce their race in the first place (they're more like a mutant strain of trollocs than a viable race in their own right, and new Myrddraal will always be born from the general trolloc population) and there's really nothing innate in them that would cause them to find humans sexually appealing (again, they're an offshoot of trollocs, and Word of God is that the only way a trolloc would find a human woman appealing is as dinner). Because Myrddraal seem to be mostly devoid of any emotion that isn't sadism, the real reason just seems to be sheer spite.
-   In _The Yillian Way_, by John Keith Laumer, the Yill ruler suggests to a human diplomat that they carouse with the handmaidens after political negotiations are over. He's been considerate enough to import some human girls for the purpose, and considers trying one of them. "I fancy an occasional perversion."
-   Deconstructed in James Tiptree Jr.'s "And I Awoke and Found Me Here On the Cold Hill's Side," which proposes that _Earth_ needs women—essentially, the way attraction works in humans (genetic difference being a huge draw to prevent inbreeding) means that attraction to other sapient species is our Hat. Your average human finds your average alien sexually irresistible, while your average alien wants nothing to do with your average human—and the few aliens who _are_ willing to take humans as lovers are looked down on by their own species as perverts.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Angel_: Cordelia gets supernaturally impregnated on 3 different occasions, in the episode 'Expecting' along with a bunch of her friends, all of whom becoming willing demon breeding slaves after being overwhelmed by their maternal instincts. Doyle is half-human/half-demon, never having known his father whilst the character of "Billy" is the product of a human raping a demon.
-   _Babylon 5_:
    -   The Narn Ambassador, G'Kar, regularly rents human prostitutes and even attempts to bribe the station's telepath into sleeping with him — for purely reproductive reasons, of course. (His species has no telepaths.) It seems to be viewed as a personal fetish of his, though, rather than a normal preference for his species. He also likes Centauri women, who are Human Aliens except for their vastly different sexual organs.
    -   Another episode that hilariously parodies this trope is "Acts of Sacrifice" with Susan Ivanova having to deal with the Lumati ambassador, whose decision to open relations with Earth is crucial. The thing is, he expects to have sex with her to seal the deal, as sex is considered just a salute in his culture equivalent to shake hands. Considering that Lumati are incredibly ugly, Dr. Franklin's advice is "put a pillow on his face and do it for Babylon 5". Despite this, she cleverly realizes that he has no idea how human sex works, so she tricks him into thinking that they had sex by dancing. Most hilariously even is that the ambassador's servant, who is supposed to be "inferior" to him, does detect the con but says nothing. It could be an aversion considering that the Lumati ambassador shows no attraction toward her; it's just business to him.
    -   The _Crusade_ spinoff revealed that inter-species pornography exists in the setting, and at least one main character has a stash of it. The video the other characters stumble across is noted to involve two species that are physically completely incompatible, but "technology is a wonderful thing".
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_:
    -   If you're an evil race of robots, what's the first thing to do after subjecting humanity to a nuclear apocalypse? Round up the survivors and put them in "farms" to produce your Half-Human Hybrid offspring, of course. While the one we saw was an all-girl institution, Word of God has it that there were stud farms as well.
    -   And in fact, the only successful union was human male-cylon female.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Parodied in "The Christmas Invasion"; the aliens demand our minerals, our cattle, and our women. The reference to women was edited out of the spoken dialogue, but one of the characters has a translator and the text can be seen on its screen.
    -   "Partners in Crime": Parodied using the two main possible meanings of "mate" as a noun in British English. The Doctor wants a friend. Donna thinks he means this.
        
        _"Well, you're not matin' with me, sunshine!"_
        
    -   Parodied again in "The Stolen Earth". For reference, the invading aliens in question are _Daleks_.
        
        **Wilf:** Get back inside, Sylvia! They always go after the women!
        
    -   Inverted in "Flesh and Stone"; Amy Pond, after an extremely traumatizing ordeal, jumps the Doctor and outright requests Glad-to-Be-Alive Sex at the very end of the episode.
    -   Subverted in "The Vampires of Venice". While the aliens are indeed after our women, by their standards, humans look like food. They're actually converting the women into females of their own species to generate a viable gene pool.
    -   "The Name of the Doctor": Strax is having one of his usual Comedic Sociopathy moments.
        
        _"This planet is now property of the Sontaran Empire! Surrender your women and intellectuals!"_
        
-   Played for Laughs while _not_ gender-inverted in _The Julekalender_ when Hansi the Nisse (basically an elf-like creature) becomes infatuated with Gertrud the human. Note that Gertrud is 52 years old (and looks a bit older), while Hansi appears much younger. They're also played by the same actor in the Norwegian version. Nothing comes of it. Gertrud never even finds out that Hansi exists, let alone that he wants her.
-   Subverted for laughs on _Malcolm in the Middle_. Aliens had been seen in a neighboring ranch in the Grotto, and as everyone rushes out to look, Otto exclaims, "Be sure not to wave at them! They think your hands are sex organs and you don't want to get into that!"
-   Rife in The Muppets, where interspecies dating is the norm. Kermit and Miss Piggy, Gonzo and Camilla, and once, on _Muppets Tonight!_, even Cindy Crawford and Bobo the Bear. Continued in the 2015 series, which is more adult oriented, and portrays Fozzie's dating a human woman as being like an interracial relationship (complete with disapproving parents who believe negative stereotypes about bears). In addition, Miss Piggy dates human men, Sam has feelings for Janice, Gonzo tries to date a human-looking Muppet (who throws him over for Liam Hemsworth), and Kermit is dating a new character who is another pig (he admits attraction to the species), but also has a crush on Lea Thompson.
-   Darulio in _The Orville_ is a blue alien who uses the effect that his pheromones have on everyone who touches him to have sex with human woman _and_ men.
-   Parodied by _Punt and Dennis_, in a sketch where they explore various science fiction tropes. Hugh Dennis plays the alien:
    
    _"Our world is dying. A mysterious space virus has wiped out all our females. We wish to take three hundred thousand of your Earth women for_ \[leers\] _breeding purposes."_
    
-   Inverted in an episode of _Red Dwarf_ where a female G.E.L.F marries Lister in exchange for a replacement for Starbug. He runs away out of terror just before the wedding night, thankfully.
-   _Sliders_: Wade is Put on a Bus... to a Kromagg breeding camp. Ewww. The Kromaggs really _did_ Need Women, as their own females had been rendered infertile by an attack on their homeworld, and since they're hominids, interbreeding isn't nearly as genetically far out as most examples on this page. Even then, the hybrids are implied to be mostly sterile.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   Gender-inverted in the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Wink of an Eye": due to living in accelerated time, the Scalosian men were rendered sterile, and the society abducts and accelerates human men in an attempt to keep their species alive. Kirk is taken but manages to return to normal time when Spock and McCoy develop an antidote to the condition. Unfortunately, the cure won't work for the Scalosians, and Kirk is forced to quarantine their planet.
    -   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
        -   Homaged in the episode "Far Beyond the Stars", in which Captain Sisko dreams that he (and several other characters from _Deep Space Nine_) are writers for a 1950s Weird Science pulp called "Incredible Tales". The illustrator comes in with his latest set of drawings (which the writers have to think up stories for) one of which<small>◊</small> shows a Bug-Eyed Monster crawling over an apartment ledge towards a buxom woman sunbathing in a towel. One of the writers, Herbert Rossoff (actually Quark without his makeup), instantly derides the picture as garbage... then quickly says he'll write the story for it.
        -   In one of the novels, Quark is persuaded (after much foot-dragging and whining) to hire a Dabo _boy_.
        -   There are a couple of Dabo girls with non-human facial features, although they do still have conventionally attractive humanoid figures.
        -   The whole thing may say more about Quark's own taste than that of his customers. Indeed, "Captive Pursuit" opens with one of the Dabo girls having come to Sisko asking for help getting out of a particular clause in the "Ferengi Print" of her contract (and presumably _all_ the Dabo girl contracts) requiring her to have sex with Quark (heavily implied, but not stated outright — it's _Trek_, after all).
        -   Standards of beauty/sexy among the station's residents seems to be similar for humans, Bajorans, and a number of other Human Alien races, so Quark's hiring practices may just be him milking the biggest share of his potential customer base. For all we know, he might have some non-humanoid dabos who come in one night a week, to appeal to his more exotic-looking customers.
    -   The Ferengi in general show attraction towards humans or Bajoran (who are basically Human Aliens) women. Examples of this include the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "Ménage à Troi" with Deanna Troi's mother Lwaxana kidnapped by a Ferengi for sexual purposes (though one Ferengi is shown to actually feel disgusted by human women). In _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, which is the one showing the Ferengi more prominently, Quark, Rom and the Ferengi King, the Grand Nagus, all show attraction to the female humanoid characters such as Major Kira, and in one episode, Nog and Jake date two Bajoran teens. Considering that the few Ferengi women we have seen are not by any means attractive by human standards, these definitely apply to this trope.
    -   Cardassians are also shown to be attracted to human and Bajoran women, which in their case has Unfortunate Implications as they occupied Bajor for years. Both _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ and _Star Trek: Voyager_ (where the Maquis, a group of anti-Cardassians guerilla fighters of federal species, mostly humans, are part of the crew) mention Cardassians raping women. One of the most critically acclaimed episodes, "Duet", has Kira mentioning the gang-rapes of Bajoran women in front of their sons as one of the many crimes committed in the Cardassians camps, as one Maquis character in Voyager also has the death of his girlfriend under such circumstances as his Dark and Troubled Past. Of course, it's possible that some Cardassians do this out of spite using rape more as a form of terror than for pleasure, but is impossible to know. Dukat, on the other hand, is indeed attracted to human women and even seduces and impregnates Bajoran women, although in his case with consent (he has a hybrid Bajoran-Cardassian daughter and also impregnated a married woman when he became the leader of a Bajoran cult). Of course, how strange is this may depend on your opinion, as Cardassians are not as different, and some people may find Cardassian women attractive.
-   Gleefully parodied in the _Walt Disney Presents_ episode "Mars and Beyond". An evil robot kidnaps the beautiful secretary of a pipe-smoking egghead, who is subjected to a number of bizarre experiments. She eventually manages to escape her captors before her boss even notices she's gone.

    Music 

-   Frank Zappa's instrumental track "Manx Needs Women" is a Pun-Based Title, found on the album _Zappa in New York_. The song has a Double Entendre in the sense that _Manx_ are inhabitants of the Isle of Man, thus explaining why they would need women.
-   Rob Zombie's song "Mars Needs Women" is just this… But not just normal women. Mars needs angry, red women.
-   Peter Wolf's "Mars Needs Women" is an Affectionate Parody retelling the B-movie's plot.
-   The British recording label 4AD used a sample from the trailer to the film _Mars Needs Women_, consisting of the eponymous phrase, in some versions of the seminal 1987 house music song "Pump Up the Volume" by MARRS, a one-off collaboration between A.R. Kane and Colourbox.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Mythology & Religion 

-   Classical Mythology has all manner of male deities, satyrs, centaurs, and demi-gods falling in lust/love with and/or abducting/raping female humans. The reverse was very rare, partly because centaurs and satyrs are One Gender Races. With the exception of some versions of the Amazons that had them taking male slaves in order to breed with them.
-   The Bible:
    -   It happened after the sons of men had multiplied in those days, that daughters were born to them, elegant and beautiful. And when the angels, the sons of heaven, beheld them, they became enamored of them, saying to each other, "Come, let us select for ourselves wives from the progeny of men, and let us beget children". — _From the Apocryphal Book of Enoch._
    -   And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. — _Genesis_ 6:1-4. (There is some religious debate on whether this is a different version of the above story.)
-   The Encantados from Brazilian Folklore: magical river dolphins which, at night, become handsome young men and seduce (human) girls. (Anyone who knows enough about bottlenoses can tell you that this depiction of dolphins is slightly more accurate than you'd think.)

    Pinball 

-   _Revenge from Mars_: Punned with the mission "Mars Kneads Women".
-   _Red & Ted's Road Show_: Suggested at the start of the Alien Invasion in Seattle:
    
    **Red:** Hey look Ted, aliens!  
    **Ted:** I think they _like_ ya, Red.
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Dragons, celestials, and fiends can and do interbreed with just about anybody, but elves and orcs have produced so many hybrids that half-elves and half-orcs are fully established races of their own. The other "half" in those cases is invariably assumed to be human. Elves like humans because their shorter lives make them more outgoing and exciting, and for an elf even a decades-long relationship can be considered a "fling". Orcs often intentionally seek out humans to breed with, as the resulting offspring will be smarter than orcs (if not as strong) and lack their sensitivity to bright light.
    -   _Forgotten Realms_: A few dwarf communities have begun (very discreetly) to encourage their young unmarried males to spend a few years living alongside humans, with the very-much-unspoken hope that some will marry human women. Dwarf-kind in the Realms has seen its population in decline for many generations, and the elder dwarves who are subtly promoting this practice hope that such pairings' half-human offspring will breed back into the dwarf population, thus infusing humans' greater fertility into their clans' bloodlines.
-   The _Paranoia_ mission "Clones in Space" features the shmegegi, except they can't bring themselves to actually follow up on their lust and wind up just reciting tepid poetry instead.
-   _Rocket Age_: Not really Mars, no, they've got their own, but apparently Callisto yetis can develop an attraction to beautiful women and handsome men.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: Commorragh needs Women. And Men. And Orks. And Tau. And Kroot. And pretty much any other species that it's possible to rape and torture.

    Theatre 

-   The entire concept behind the Firenze/Umbridge pairing in _A Very Potter Sequel._

    Video Games 

-   In the second game of the _Ace Attorney_ series, the third case involved an 'assumingly' living puppet that has a romantic obsession with one of the female characters in that particular case... even with intents on marrying her someday.
-   _A Hint of a Tint_: All of the Cute Monster Girls are a female-only One-Gender Race and because of that need human males to mate with. The problem is, there are no humans living in their world, so they use magic to summon men from ours.
-   In _Bloodborne_, this is what started off the game's entire plot. The Great Ones, perhaps due to their very nature, are unable to have children with each other, and thus yearn for surrogates among humanity.
-   In _Brütal Legend_, Eddie and his army, Ironheade, befriend and recruit an Amazon Brigade known as the Zaulia. They like to abduct "mates," and have something called "The Mating Challenge" they invite men to.
-   Predictably in _Destroy All Humans!_, as it's a loving send-up and parody of 50's alien invasion flicks, with the player as the alien invader. One of your earliest missions is to kidnap one human female for "testing" purposes, so the aliens can determine if human DNA can solve their cloning problem. The sequel ramps it up by heavily implying your character is the first of these aliens in a very long time to have a, ahem, "package."
-   Played straight in the _Duke Nukem_ game _Land of the Babes_. Earth has been taken over, all the other men have been killed, and the "human babe" is the hottest commodity in the universe.
    -   Also, of the other Duke Nukem games, starting with _3D_.
        
        "Nobody steals our chicks... and lives."
        
    -   In fact, killing one of the women in 3D results in more enemies spawning. They're serious about getting those women.
    -   _Duke Nukem Forever_ has Duke himself lampshade the frequency of this trope.
        
        "Damn it, why do they always take the hot ones?"
        
        -   In this case, it's horrifyingly played straight: human women make great alien breeding pods. _Expendable_ breeding pods. Duke is unable to save any of the women hooked up and raped until their brains turn to mush, including his girlfriends.
-   _Exterlien_ is a 1990 PC-98 H-Game that revolves around a beauty contest at an amusement park being interrupted by an invasion of bizarre eldritch monsters, who proceed to kidnap the women for the "pleasure" of their master Ruzu. Your job, as the protagonist Masato, is to defeat the monsters and rescued the distressed (and half-dressed) damsels.
-   The description for the Blob Monster Orthros in _Final Fantasy Tactics A2_ claims it has "an inordinate Fondness of comely Maidens." Orthros only appears in _Final Fantasy XII_ if you have an all-female party. Orthros is an Expy of the octopus Ultros from _Final Fantasy VI_. If his battle dialogue is to be believed, the latter is also an example of this trope.
-   Played for Laughs in _Halo 5: Guardians_. One of the audio logs you can collect is a love poem from a Sangheilli admirer of a certain female Spartan-IV. Who's the lucky lady you ask? Commander Sarah Palmer, of course. Doubly hilarious since her voice actress is Jennifer Hale, probably best known for playing female Commander Shepard in the _Mass Effect_ franchise, whose ability to seduce members of other species has reached Memetic Mutation status.
-   _Invasion: The Abductors_: Though males and females alike are turned into mutants, the alien lab on board the mothership seems to exclusively be holding women in bikinis.
-   Daxter of the _Jak and Daxter_ series. Although he has the excuse that he used to be human (or the local equivalent thereof), he also manages to actually _get_ a girl during the series, who eventually gets turned into an Ottsel like him.
-   In a rare Fantasy example, the Ruloi from _Lands of Lore_, who are invaders from another world, kidnap females, although not necessarily humans — in one cutscene they abduct a huline woman. What exactly they do with them is never explained, although one Ruloi telepathically tells Copper in the third game that "We need vessels."
-   _The Legend of Zelda_ depicts Link as a subject of romantic attention from Zora women like Ruto and Mipha. _Oracle of Ages_ depicts Link getting the affections of the Maku Tree, while _Oracle of Seasons_ lets him go on a date with Rosa of the Subrosians, a race of hooded creatures whose actual appearance is unknown.
-   Equal Opportunity again: Ruby, Hiro's sidekick in _Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete_ who looks like a flying cat, happens to have a crush on him. Equally creepy, for those who somehow haven't played the first game, is the fact that the Human character Nall seems to have a crush on _Ruby_. But as it turns out, Ruby and Nall are both dragons.
-   Played with in _Mass Effect_:
    -   While the Player Character can pursue many different species who all presumably find Shepard physically attractive, it mostly has to do with the fact that they're Shepard, and not due to a specific human fetish.
    -   However, human women are still seen as mostly attractive — rather than on their own merits, it has to do with the fact they resemble the asari nearly perfectly. The asari were the first (currently living) species to achieve galactic expansion, and all other species look at them as a symbol of wisdom, power, and beauty. Combine this with the fact asari can mate with _any_ species, the asari — and therefore human female — form is considered a standard of beauty, even for extremely non-human species like the krogan.
    -   The asari themselves are this trope, as they can produce an offspring with any other species. Though they can mate with one another, doing so is very taboo, as the resulting offspring have a small chance of manifesting a dangerous genetic condition. Therefore, most asari tend to seek out partners of a different species since this prevents the condition in question from manifesting.
-   In _ObsCure II_, Kenny undergoes a Face–Monster Turn due to mortifilia infection that leads him to kidnap and rape Amy, impregnating her with a monstrous spawn. Delta Theta Gamma attempts to take Amy away in order to study her and her offspring, but her Express Delivery kills her and her captors. The Bolivian Army Ending has Stan and Shannon, the last surviving protagonists, facing down the monster in question.
-   _Quake II_ has a weird variant: the Strogg are a race of cyborgs who "reproduce" by combining robotics with "spare parts" from conquered races. At one point you find a processing plant where captured humans are ground up, liquefied, etc to make more Strogg parts.
-   Pastiched in _Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse_, in which the alien gorilla Skun-ka'pe is romantically obsessed with Girl Stinky (who isn't exactly human, but appears perfectly human and comes from Earth). Skun-ka'pe's whole character is a big Shout-Out to zero-budget 50s sci-fi B Movies such as _Robot Monster_, so everyone's fairly Genre Savvy about this. Also, Girl Stinky is romantically involved with Sal, a _six foot tall Cockroach_.
-   _Star Control II_ has Admiral ZEX, a hideous tentacle alien whose species, the VUX, finds humans completely repulsive and all except the strongest stomachs amongst them projectile vomit violently as soon as they see one. However, ZEX is different. He...'enjoys' humans.
    -   Though in this case his specific obsession is with the male Captain.
    -   Heck, at the end of the game, you wind up marrying a Syreen captain. Turns out that Syreen are biologically human; the blue skin and red hair are just racial traits. To this day, nobody knows why humans have two extremely distant homeworlds.
    -   Taken one step farther in that the Syreen (the race from which the Captain's future wife comes from) are heavily implied to need men (specifically human men) to keep their race going, since most men were killed when their homeworld was destroyed. The survivors are mostly female because it was mostly the all-female Space Patrol that was off-planet at the time.
-   In _Superfrog_ for the Amiga, Superfrog's girlfriend is a human princess, and at the end of the game he's not at all pleased when she turns into a fellow frog after he kisses her.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   Bowser is a Stalker with a Crush on Peach. Bowser is a giant somewhat-dragon-like tortoise. And it's not just Bowser; a _computer_ falls for Peach in _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_.
    -   Also Rosalina from _Super Mario Galaxy_. According to her backstory, the main reason why the Lumas (an entire race of star people) kidnapped her is because a young Luma thought that she was its mother, and as a result _all_ of the younger Lumas wanted her to be their mother too. But then Rosalina discovered that her real family on Earth is now long dead, and as a result she agreed to be the Lumas' mother from then on.
    -   Princess Daisy's first and, as far as we know, only abduction was by a literal space alien known as Tatanga in her first appearance in _Super Mario Land_.
-   In the _Thera_ Game Mod for _Medieval II: Total War_, the Uruk Dominion's bestial warriors are bred by having their strongest and most capable soldiers breed with captured human women. Apparently, the Uruks and Ly Kans, despite their outwardly monstrous appearances, are genetically similar enough to humans that they can breed true, though male offspring of such a union are always bestial while female offspring are always human.
-   _Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos_:
    -   Subverted where a group of orcs come across quillboars — a race of bipedal boars that only barely qualify as "anthromorphic" — and one of them remarks that "at least they're prettier than humans". (It could be said that the Orcs have a somewhat porcine appearance, so...).
    -   Warchief Thrall was long believed to be a case of this trope, since his best childhood friend was a human girl the same age as him (a lot of people assume they were more than friends), and he's had a good friendship with Jaina Proudmoore (with whom he's commonly shipped). However, Chris Metzen has stated that Thrall just plain isn't into human women and married an Orcish woman.
-   Averted in _X-COM: UFO Defense_. The aliens do kidnap earth women (and animals) but it isn't an act of eroticism — they simply use them in genetic engineering, both to mix human DNA with the other subject races in their civilisation (to produce even better warriors etc.) and to breed them (note that the woman isn't necessarily alive at the time).
-   The Trope Namer is given a nod in the twelfth level of _Zombies Ate My Neighbors_, titled "Mars Needs Cheerleaders," the character's first encounter with Martians and their space saucer.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Sable's Grimoire_, a few demihuman races are noted to exclusively pursue people outside their own species when it comes to mating or romance. The pixies, for instance, are a One-Gender Race who can only reproduce by mating with the males of other species. Succubi and Incubi, meanwhile, view the thought of falling in love with a member of their own race as something repulsive and taboo, and would much rather pursue humans romantically.

    Web Animation 

-   _Homestar Runner_:
    -   In the toon Date Nite, The Cheat (a Pikachu-esque Speech-Impaired Animal) goes on a date with Marzipan (a... human being? Maybe? She's a lot closer to human than The Cheat, anyway). To be fair, Marzipan is the only female character in the series. Who _else_ is he going to go out with?
    -   Strong Bad is also attracted to humans.

    Webcomics 

-   _Digger_ parodies this when Digger, a wombat, is joining the hyena tribe for complicated reasons. One of the (matriarchal) hyenas says "What's she going to do? Move into our huts, eat our food, and seduce our menfolk?" "It could happen..."
-   The Demonic Duck from _El Goonish Shive_ is attracted to humans. When the gay character Justin comments on how unnatural this is, the duck replies, "Oh, gee, I don't know. Shouldn't _you_ be attracted to _women?_" Justin concedes the point.
-   _Freefall_: Parodied here. Actually, the abducted red robot had recorded evidence of a crime, which Sawtooth was recovering for the investigation.
-   In _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!,_ it's been established that Nemesites really _do_ care mainly about personality over anything else, and so interspecies romances are not that uncommon; Ahem is quick to point out that this fact is also a convenient excuse for arranging otherwise preposterous political marriages.
-   Parodied in _Manly Guys Doing Manly Things_ by referencing _Mars Needs Moms_, but with Duke Nukem getting on their ship.
-   _Narbonic_:
    -   Inverted in the side-story, The Astonishing Excursions of Helen Narbon & Co., set in the Victorian Era. Chapter Sixteen is in fact titled "Mars Needs Men", and shows that the entire population of Mars is female. We later discover that they are in fact shape-shifting protoplasmic blobs, taking the form of the only human they've ever met — Helen Narbon's mother.
    -   Also Artie, a gerbil, wonders why he's interested in humans. Specifically, male ones.
-   Inverted in _The Order of the Stick_: Tsukiko is attracted to the undead, and in love with Xykon. Xykon's not interested however, as he's "not one of those disgusting biophilliacs".
-   _Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal_:
    -   Parodied in "Where are the Aliens?", where an alien is freaked out by a human's assuming it's come to breed with their women, but even more freaked out that the human would be willing to do such a thing himself.
        
        "That'd be like if _you_ went to another planet and found a species of sapient alien goats, then decided to have sex with them to see if you'd get hybrid alien-goat-human babies!"
        
        "Take me to the alien sexgoats!"
        
    -   Inverted: In this comic the alien demands 100,000 humans to be used as breeding mates-but it turns out it was a Secret Test of Character to see if humanity should be condemned (if they had forced the people on the aliens) or invited to join the galactic federation (if they had refused). So the alien is absolutely flummoxed when he finds out that the 100,000 humans _volunteered_, all of them recruited on fetish boards. In fact, the UN secretary general notes that they had more volunteers than they needed and the extra panel reveals the secretary general's one of them.
-   _Schlock Mercenary_:
    -   Sergeant Schlock is a Carboscilicate Amorph, who is frequently confused with a pile of crap (much to his annoyance). In addition to him falling in love with the human Admiral Breya Andreyasn, there was also a running joke about him having a _Sports Lustystrated 1000 Years of Swimsuit Editions_ Collection in the early days of the comic.
        
        **Jevee Ceeta:** The thought of you having romantic feelings towards human females makes me crawl inside, Sergeant.  
        **Schlock:** Why? It's very natural and normal.  
        **Jevee Ceeta:** I can explain it in two words, and they rhyme with 'Pentacle Rex.'
        
    -   As tends to be the case with this comic, however, it's justified. Carboscilicate Amorphs are effectively asexual, and reproduce through a form of mitosis. Through observation, character-traits and parts of the personality of the 'mate' is imprinted on the proto-amorph... and as such, Amorphs are attracted primarily to strong personalities and character-traits, regardless of the physical form. In fact, it turns out that Schlock's grandmother is a human.
-   In _Trying Human_ The Greys. It's complicated.

    Web Original 

-   This happens a _lot_ on Literotica. The only version more common than "alien abducts human woman For Science!" is "alien abducts human man and turns him into a woman For Science!"
-   Inverted in this piece of art, appropriately named "Mars Needs Men".
-   One of the "Monkey News" segments on _The Ricky Gervais Show_ involved a chimp named "Ollie" whom the zookeeper took a liking to. Ultimately, he brought the chimp home because it was becoming morose at the zoo, and it wound up making a pass at his wife. Apparently at least some of the story was true.
-   _Pay Me, Bug!_: Discussed, and ultimately averted:
    
    "It's about time Dyorbid actually hired an attractive waitress," Morgan said. Grif laughed.  
    "Well, hold on," Grif said, "let's be fair. The Murdec who worked here a few months back was very attractive... to other Murdecs."
    

    Western Animation 

-   Through the various _Alvin and the Chipmunks_ cartoons, many humans have shown attraction to the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. Alvin, Theodore and Brittany especially. Even in _ALVINNN!!! and the Chipmunks_, where they're the size of normal chipmunks.
-   _American Dad!_ has Klaus the goldfish lusting after Francine Smith. However, he _was_ human, but had his brain put into a goldfish's body by the CIA because... ya know, it's just easier not to explain the whole situation. Roger the alien also has a crush on Hayley and/or Francine in one episode. Okay, so it was just a scam to get a free T-shirt, but still. He would later develop a crush on Hayley for real, and got so obsessed with her that he took her hostage and nearly cut her skin off.
-   Bugs Bunny has an infatuation with human women, a couple of notable examples: Near the end of "Bugs Bunny Rides Again", he fights Yosemite Sam for a train full of women heading for Miami and after he wins, Bugs waves goodbye to Sam while covered in lipstick. In "Slick Hare", he avoids Elmer Fudd, who wants to roast Bugs for a sandwich for Humphrey Bogart, in the end he reveals that he wanted the sandwich for his girlfriend Lauren Bacall, to whom he refers as "Baby"; when Bugs hears this he says, "Anything Baby wants, Baby gets," and Bugs delivers himself on a platter for her while ogling and howling at her.
-   _Duck Dodgers_ lusts after girls a lot, and they're humans more often than not.
-   Twilight Sparkle in _EQUESTRIA GIRLS_ was definitely attracted to Flash Sentry's human counterpart. The Fan Fictions and parodies where Twilight had a _thing_ for humans immediately followed.
-   Brian the dog on _Family Guy_ has the hots for Lois, the (human) wife of Peter Griffin. When Peter is thought to have died, Brian and Lois get married, and almost consummate their relationship, until Peter ends up being found. He also has a relationship, and, evidently, quite a lot of sex with Jillian, and had sex with Lauren Conrad, which gave her worms as a result. It's probably best not to think too much about that. "The Former Life of Brian" reveals that he had a son (!) with one of his girlfriends. The son, creepily, appears to be entirely human, and all problematic aspects of his existence are hand waved away — even the most basic ones.
-   In one episode of _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_, Bloo becomes temporarily infatuated with Frankie — as do Mac, a teenager, and an imaginary man.
    
    **Mac:** She's so nice.  
    **Bloo:** And hot!
    
-   _Futurama_:
    -   Amy and Kif's romance... but on _that_ show, nobody seems to give species a second thought in romantic pairings anyway (just as long as you aren't dating a robot).
    -   Or, conversely, as long as you're not dating a human: "If anyone asks, you're my debugger."
    -   In one episode dealing with evolving robots, apparently after 1 billion years of robotic evolutionary history (about 2 days for humans), robotic Neanderthals thought that, despite humans being made of substances they'd never seen before, Leela and Amy were hot enough to kidnap and make their wives.
    -   Subverted with the Miss Universe beauty pageant. Despite having multiple contestants that looked like attractive human females (and even some actual humans!), the winner was a giant paramecium.
-   The gnomes in _Gravity Falls_ are an all-male race that requires a human "queen". Thus, in "Tourist Trapped", they try to force Mabel to marry them.
-   Inverted in an episode of _Johnny Bravo_ when the title character is abducted by an all-female race of space aliens who then proceed with making him their king. Everything goes fine, until Johnny has them install cable TV. The aliens immediately lose interest in him after seeing Mel Gibson.
-   _Justice League_:
    -   In the series, Gorilla Grodd is known for his three companions, the hot (and Mad) scientist he met on the Internet; Giganta, a size-changing ape-turned-human, and Tala, a witch. He's got taste.
    -   Shortly before the end of the last season, J'onn decided to go on hiatus for a while. A few episodes later, as he reappears for the last battle, it's pretty clear that he spent that time living with a middle-aged Chinese woman.
-   On one episode of _King of the Hill_, Hank Hill goes to swim with a dolphin event, rubs the dolphin's belly, and well...
-   _The New Adventures of Superman_: In "The Mysterious Mr. Mist", the disembodied Mr. Mist is obsessed with capturing Lois Lane and dragging her back to his subterranean realm to make her his queen.
-   Scooby-Doo's attraction to Sandy Duncan.
-   The page image here comes from _The Simpsons: Treehouse of Horror IX_ (during the short "Starship Poopers"). In this (non-canon) origin story for Maggie Simpson, her mother Marge reveals that she was once abducted by the alien Kang, who tried (and failed) to seduce her with some corny pick-up lines. Marge explains that she tried to resist but powerful mind-confusion techniques were used (when Marge looks away, Kang fired an energy beam that caused her to become pregnant with their hybrid baby, Maggie).
-   There are a small handful of minor examples in _Transformers_. And then there is _Kiss Players._
