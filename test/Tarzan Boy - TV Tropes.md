Most definitely _not_ Tarzan.

An Expy of _Tarzan_, and the Spear Counterpart to Jungle Princess. A Tarzan Boy, or "Tarzanesque", is a white man who lives in the jungle, usually in the Darkest Africa. He's usually Raised by Wolves after being marooned in the jungle as a child. Expect the Nubile Savage trope to be in play, as the Tarzan Boy will always be handsome and surprisingly well-groomed and clean-shaven for a guy who lives completely isolated from civilization. Often he will have one or several animal companions and is able to communicate with them. He'll be an Earthy Barefoot Character, wear a Loincloth and no shirt, and travel around by Vine Swing.

Tarzan Boy usually finds his "Jane" in a civilized white woman he has to rescue. Sometimes, however, he will choose his Distaff Counterpart, the Jungle Princess, or occasionally the native Chief's daughter (who will inevitably be drawn in a much more attractive manner than the other natives who are seen).

This trope was popular up until The '50s. As with many pulp tropes, its popularity waned in the second part of the twentieth century, but there were still occasional attempts to revisit it, either parodic or serious. Interestingly, this trope's Distaff Counterpart, Jungle Princess, eventually surpassed it in popularity.

Subtrope of Nature Hero. Compare Handsome Heroic Caveman, the prehistoric equivalent. Contrast Frazetta Man (these are usually present as Tarzan Boy's enemies, to further emphasize the contrast between them).

    Comic Books 

-   Marvel Comics
    -   _Ka-Zar_. He started as a short-lived cheap Tarzan knock-off in the '30s, described as an American kid who was raised by lions after his parents' plane crashed in the Congo jungle. Ka-Zar was revived decades later by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in an _X-Men_ comic and given a more fleshed-out characterization. Surprisingly, they made him _more_ similar to Tarzan. Now he was Kevin Plunder, son of a British nobleman who had discovered the tropical Lost World of Savage Land in the middle of the Antarctic. After his father got killed by a local Frazetta Man tribe, Kevin was raised by a mutant intelligent sabertooth tiger named Zabu. He eventually hooked up with Marvel's flagship Jungle Princess, _Shanna the She-Devil_.
    -   Before the revival, Ka-Zar got his own cheap knock-off called _Lo-Zar_. He was also a blonde muscle man, with unknown origins. He lived in the Republic of Congo and helped local tribes and wild animals. Unlike other Tarzan Boys, Lo-Zar's enemy of choice were Dirty Communists.
    -   One-time _Daredevil_ rogue Micah Synn was a villainous example. He was a direct descendant of English settlers that lived among an East African tribe, and became chief through Asskicking Leads to Leadership. He lived by a Social Darwinist "might makes right" philosophy that resulted in him stealing food, fighting cops, and eventually becoming The Kingpin's minion. However, his body had difficulty adjusting to Western civilization and he was weakened to the point that he got beaten up by a gang of hobos and needed Daredevil to Save the Villain.
-   _Kaanga, Lord of the Jungle_: Not much is known about his backstory. Kaanga was left marooned in a jungle as a small kid after his parents met their death, and was raised by apes. Unlike Tarzan, he had rather short blonde hair. He later rescued a white woman from slave traders and she became his girlfriend.
-   _Jo-Jo, Congo King_: Jo-Jo was a guy who wore leopard skin shorts and had a Jungle Princess girlfriend named Tanee, who usually shared his adventures. Tanee had the tendency to get tied up a lot, especially on comic book covers, which was even pointed out by one Dr. Fredric Wertham who considered it an example of inappropriate bondage fetishism.
-   _Thun'da, King of the Congo_: Created by Frank Frazetta, who drew the whole first issue, interiors and all. Thun'da initially started in a Lost World filled with dinosaurs, but was soon relocated to Darkest Africa. Unlike most Tarzan Boys, he wasn't marooned in the jungle as a kid, but instead crashed his plane there as an adult. He was enslaved by the local Frazetta Man cavemen and escaped, and soon encountered and fell in love with a Bettie Page\-esque Nubile Savage princess Pha who ruled over a white human tribe in a Forgotten City. In 2012 Dynamite Comics published a modern retelling of Thun'da's story.
-   _Kalthar the Giant Man_ by Archie Comics: His father died protecting an African tribe called Urganas from Arab slavers. Out of gratitude, the Urganas raised the orphaned boy, and eventually made him their chief. In a superhero twist on the usual Tarzan Boy formula, Kalthar possessed magical grains that allowed him to grow in size. He could also talk to animals. Kalthar's series ended with him marrying a white woman he met earlier, despite objections from his tribe.
-   _Wambi the Jungle Boy_: He had the distinction of being a young kid instead of a grown-up man. His jungle also looked more like an Indian jungle than an African one. No explanation was given about his origins or backstory. Like many Tarzan Boys, he had several animal friends and could communicate with them.
-   _Akim_: An Italian Tarzanesque comic book character, created in The '50s. He was quite similar to Tarzan, being a son of a British consul who was raised by gorillas after his parents got killed by jungle beasts, and later got a wife and an adopted son.
-   _Zembla_: A French Tarzanesque comic book character, created in The '60s, spurred by the popularity of _Akim_. Zembla had several funny animal sidekicks (including a kangaroo and also a human stage magician friend.
-   _Tarzanetto_: An Italian comic book character who started as a minor parody of Tarzan, but eventually got popular enough to star in his own comic. He looks like a bald cigar-smoking boy.
-   _Planetary_ features a modern and rather morally ambiguous take on the Tarzan Boy trope in Lord Blackstock. A scion of a shady British family of adventurers, he's considered a hero of the African continent. However, he doesn't concern himself with anything besides relieving his boredom, and prefers to think of the natives as his subjects. It's also implied he's having sex with his apes.
-   _Lion Man_ from _All-Negro Comics_ was a rare attempt at a black Tarzan Boy. He was a scientist employed by the United Nations who wore a loincloth and headband, and fought to protect an African uranium mine from falling into the wrong hands.
-   DC Comics: _Kamandi_ is a young hero in a post-apocalyptic, post-Cyberpunk future. After a huge event called "The Great Disaster", humans have been reduced back to savagery in a world ruled by intelligent, highly evolved animals. Created by Jack Kirby in the time he was in DC, Kirby was asked to make something similar than _Planet of the Apes_ comic books, resulting into this. Different from Tarzan, Kamandi is a blonde guy in a post-Cyberpunk world with similar traits as Tarzan, also known for being the grandson of O.M.A.C. and even he was part of the heroes' group during the _Crisis on Infinite Earths_.
-   Wild Smurf of _The Smurfs_ is a Tarzan Smurf. Introduced in the 1980s Animated Adaptation and brought into the comic books in the 1990s, Wild was a Smurf who, upon the night of his "birth" by Delivery Stork, was lost in the forest and raised by squirrels until his public discovery by the Smurfs. Although animalistic in his behaviors, Wild at least knew how to assemble a Smurf hat out of leaves, and in the comic books eventually learned how to speak in very primitive Smurf language when the Smurfs had him stay in the village during the winter.
-   The first _Superboy_ volume featuring a two-part imaginary story (183 and 188) respectively where Superboy landed in Africa, was raised by apes and become such a character. This would be revisted for the Elseworld and crossover _Superman/Tarzan: Sons of the Jungle_.

    Comic Strips 

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Avatar: The Way of Water_: Spider grew up in the jungle (albeit Raised by Natives rather than Wolves), he's always shirtless with a Loincloth, is something of a Wild Child, adopts a Primal Stance sometimes, and manages to keep up with Na'vis when they swing and run in the canopies of Pandora's forests. And he's the son of a white human who died in the jungle.
-   _The Worlds Greatest Athelete_: The plot centers around a college track coach discovering a jungle man in Africa and bringing him home to give his team a boost.
-   _Wild Thing_ is an urban twist on this trope. In this film the main character grows up wild in the city's slums after witnessing drug dealers murder his parents. The story revolves around him helping the city's residents who are being terrorized by street gangs and drug dealers.

    Literature 

-   _The Jungle Book_: Mowgli could be considered the Ur-Example, since he appeared years before Tarzan himself did. (But he is native, and for most of the stories, younger). Actually, Rudyard Kipling himself accused Tarzan of being an Expy of Mowgli, however, Edgar Rice Burroughs denied it.
-   _The Son Of Tarzan_ (1915): In this novel Jack, the son of Tarzan and Jane, returned to Africa and became a jungle hero similar to his father, taking the name of _Korak_. The character was later adapted into various comic series, sometimes having solo adventures, sometimes appearing alongside Tarzan.
-   _Ki-Gor_ was the most popular Tarzan imitator during the 40-50s. He was a blond muscular guy in leopard tights who had a gorgeous redheaded wife with a similar fashion sense. His story cycle was quite Fair for Its Day, featuring a black Massai chief who was shown to be a noble and resourceful hero in his own right, and was treated as a brother by Ki-Gor.
-   There are some terms, such as "tarzanesque" and "tarzanide" or "tarzanidi" (Italian version), coined by the French journalist Francis Lacassin, author of _Tarzan ou le Chevalier crispÃƒÂ©_ (1971).
-   _King Dong_ had Marzipan was in an on again/off again gay relationship with the titular giant gorilla.

    Music 

-   "Tarzan Boy" by Baltimora: The Trope Namer. Its lyrical hero is this type of character, who lives the "jungle life" "far away from nowhere". Those who spent a lot of time on the internet in the mid-to-late 2000s will probably know it best as the song associated with the "Gay Fuel" fad on YTMND.
    -   There's also a remixed version called "Tarzan Boy 2000" by Jungle Groover ft. Mr. Z. The rather campy music video features a ditzy parody of Tarzan (somewhat similar to _George of the Jungle_), who is lusted upon by a Jane-esque Ms. Fanservice.
    -   Wrestling fans will know this song best as the theme for Jungle Boy of All Elite Wrestling.
-   The Talking Heads song "Totally Nude" is about a person who willingly leaves modern society to live as a wild man in the forest.
    
    _Nature boy, nature man, take me along  
    Deep in the woods we're undiscovered_
    

    Professional Wrestling 

-   "Jungle Boy" Jack Perry from All Elite Wrestling plays this trope to a T. The Trope Namer is even his official entrance theme.

    Radio 

-   Tarzan himself featured in multiple radio dramas, such as _Tarzan Lord of The Jungle_ (1951)
-   The religious radio drama _PatchThePirate_ has a couple of jungle adventures and two notable Tarzan Boy characters.
    
    -   Banana Man (Not to be confused with the British superhero of the save name) is more of a parody similar to Gorge of the Jungle than John Clayton. When a sailor asked if he was like Tarzan, he replied, "Yup, me and Tarzan are almost identical twins; the only difference is that Tarzan is good at fighting apes, and I'm good at fighting Bananas" (Though he claims they look alike, in the cover art, Banana Man more resembles Captain Caveman with an enormous chin instead of a beard) Although he looks like a classic Mighty Whitey, he is actually part of an ancient culture of banana wielding warriors following what they call "Bananahood" complete with a Lost Language where characters of script are formed using tiny Bananas. When another sailor asks if he is Tarzan, he replies, "Tarzan? That wimp" Banana man tends to respond whenever someone unfortunately says the word "help", with "Help? Did I hear help? Naaa-aaa-aaa Banana Man!" and he arives via Vine Swing and forgets to Watch Out for That Tree!. He is untarnished from cartoon logic "Although I've had some freckles, I have never had a burse" in his own words, but the trees can no longer take it to the point of causing a literal ecological crisis.
    
    Princess Pirate (after seeing Bananaman hit a tree: "That's gotta hurt" Lily Elephant: "You'd better believe it hurts honey. We're loosing more rainforest everyday. Somehow we've got to save the trees!" Ironic considering she said, "Don't worry...the trees are used to him" in an earlier episode.
    
    -   The trope was a Deconstructed in the episode "Kilimanjaro", where Captain Patch hires a guide named Barefoot Ben; a man who was an orphan of missionaries if Africa, who now lives in the jungle, likely carrying on his parents business. His knowledge of the jungle is so keen that he simply lives in the wilderness. "I live in the jungle. Everyday I get to work under the sun; every night I get to sleep under the stars. Who want's to live in a house when you can enjoy the beauty of God's creation" He also knows how to find food and avoid predators, sleeps in trees with hammocks he carries around and even has a pet Bush Baby. He speaks fluent English, and is implied to be fluent in Swahili as well. Although he does use modern tools and cloths, opting for an Adventurer Outfit instead of the Loincloth, he still Prefers Going Barefoot due to his keen knowledge of the jungle allowing him to avoid obstacles. According to his hilarious theme song preformed by the local monkeys for some reason, he has The Strength of Ten Men. He is also given more character in how he values godly wisdom and his faith rather than being merely a Nature Lover.

    Video Games 

-   _Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland_ has Junglo the Jungle Hero, who used to be a strong, Tarzan-like figure who lived in the jungle. At the time of the game, he's well past his prime and even Tingle himself is stronger than him.
-   The first game of _Wonder Boy_ series is about the titular character being a blonde good-looking caveman/jungle boy who has to travel into an island and atacking creatures to rescue his girl.

-   The Nuka-World DLC of _Fallout 4_ has Cito, who was raised by "Ghoulrillas" (mutated version of gorillas) residing in the park's animal preserve.
-   Gonta Gokuhara in _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_, a Gentle Giant who was raised away from society for most of his life by animals and decided to make an effort to become a gentleman after returning to human civilization. As a result, he's a Genius Ditz who's one of the world's leading experts on entomology and wilderness survival but fails to grasp simple subjects like proper grammar.
