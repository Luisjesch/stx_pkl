"Oh, no, it's the cops! Oh, and a... construction worker!"

**Grey:** Can you remind us how you got your uniform torn three Halloweens ago?  
**Bradford:** ... uh... _If_ you get dispatched to a loud party... make sure they know you're not the stripper.

Private strippers show up in sitcomland all the time. Male or female, they come dressed as police officers and are mistaken for them (the protagonist is often accidentally handcuffed to them), while real cops (or some other authority figures) are thought to be strippers, leading the protagonists to rip their shirts off.

Compare Dirty Harriet where a character poses as a sex worker to solve a case. See Mistaken for Clown for a more innocent variant.

-   Inverted with a Jack in the Box commercial for breakfast platters, in which Jack approves of a policeman, a firefighter, and a construction worker being the hardworking people who would eat them. Cut to said figures baring all at a bachelorette party.

    Comic Strips 

-   Reversed in a strip by Sergio Aragones in _Mad Magazine_. A female police officer storms into a room full of bad guys—and is woefully outnumbered. She then backpedals, pretends to be a stripper, gets a tip, waves goodbye, then runs to the police car and radios for more backup.

    Films — Animation 

-   Implied in _Zootopia_ when Mr. Big sees Judy Hopps in clearly a police uniform and asks if she's "some kind of performer" hanging around with Nick Wilde. Judy rather unwisely takes serious offense to a _mob boss_ refusing to believe she's a real cop.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Down Periscope_, Commander Dodge initially mistakes a female officer assigned to his submarine for a stripper. The fact that she was the first woman allowed into the submarine service branch doesn't exactly justify it.

-   Breacher and his team give Det. Brentwood this treatment in _Sabotage (2014)_ when she arrives at his house to get a statement from one of them. She's plainclothes and not dressed in anything resembling a police uniform, so it seems like the gang are mocking her just to be dicks (which, to be fair, they are). Then, of course, a _real_ stripper shows up in a sexy cop outfit just as she is leaving.

    Literature 

-   In one of G.K. Chesterton's _Father Brown_ mystery stories, the criminal gets rid of a policeman by convincing everyone at the house that the man is actually in costume for a pantomime show. He beats up the cop while the audience laughs at the slapstick comedy.
