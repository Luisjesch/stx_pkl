An Older Than Dirt relief of a woman spinning.  
Note that her dress, hairdo and elaborate hassock indicate she is upper class.

_"She seeks out wool and flax and weaves with skillful hands.  
She puts her hands to the distaff, and her fingers ply the spindle.  
She is not concerned for her household when it snows— all her charges are doubly clothed.  
She makes her own coverlets; fine linen and purple are her clothing.  
She makes garments and sells them, and stocks the merchants with belts.  
She is clothed with strength and dignity, and laughs at the days to come."_

First you got to spin, then weave, then sew — and even then, when you have the clothes, you need to mend and launder as necessary to keep them in good condition. And iron, if wrinkles are a problem. Fancy clothing may require embroidery and lace-making, though that tends to be upper-class. Knitting and crochet can also come into play.

All of these are feminine tasks, undertaken by women and proving them womanly; among well-to-do characters, this is a sign of old-fashioned virtue, especially if other women devote the time to partying, and among poorer ones, a sign of them being thrifty housekeepers. The princess or other lady, handing out The Lady's Favour to the Knight in Shining Armor, often made it with her own hands. This is the source of the _distaff_ in Distaff Counterpart.

The Rebellious Princess and other tomboyish female characters are likely to be bad at them, which is generally treated in more modern works less seriously than it was in Real Life. Expect a tomboy in a pre-modern setting to be forced to sit through a sewing lesson and be terrible at it, her stitches flying all over the cloth, while being compared to a more feminine girl her age (often her sister) who can do it perfectly.

Female textile work was in fact an economic activity of major importance to the welfare of her kin group given the lack of department stores and ready-made clothes for most of human history. In Imperial China, silk (or sometimes linen) woven by the women of the household was used to pay taxes. In Norse folklore, spinning and weaving were key elements in woman's magic, _seiðr_.

The art most frequently depicted is spinning, which is the most time-consuming, and also easily portable and interruptible. This makes spinning, along with other textile arts such as weaving and knitting, very compatible with childcare. With a distaff, a woman can spin with one hand, leaving the other available to aid with nursing. Once a child is past infancy, they can aid in the textile process as well by teasing fleece, carding, and once they reach an age at which they have control of their hands, in the spinning itself. This historical fact is why, until well into the 20th century, textile arts excepting the more labor-intensive activities (such as fulling flax, rope-making, weaving, etc.) were feminine by default.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Beginning in the latter part of the 20th century, this convention faded steadily due to a combination of industrialization, the craft movement, and increasing gender equality.

Men — more commonly associated with comparatively masculine metalworking — who engage in such work must pull off Real Men Wear Pink to be taken seriously in most works. Even in Fairy Tales, the tailor is more prone to be a trickster than a dragon-slayer. Compare Feminine Women Can Cook, with the added advantage that it's easy to lug about a distaff or some sewing or knitting and do it anywhere.

The Industrial Revolution was the Trope Breaker, slowly working down the tasks. Though early textile mills relied on a young female workforce, spinning and weaving were among the first things that automation took over. In the 1950s, the Housewife had a sewing machine. Since then, textile arts have seesawed between "cool hobby" (which is where they are now) to "fit only for old ladies" (which is where they were in the 1980s). Naturally, since most writers are middle-aged and grew up in the 1980s, media directed at young males mostly perpetuates the inaccurate (and rather strange) idea that nobody knits anymore. Cue laughter from the 8.5 million users (2% of whom are guys) of Ravelry.

These days being a fashion designer is largely the replacement, though not without carrying over some stereotypes from this trope.

-   In _Bokurano_, a girl named Mako "Nakama" Nakarai has quite the skill with her sewing machine. She even has a very specific goal in regards to her tailoring/sewing skills: making uniforms for the other pilots before it's her time to pilot Zearth and die as a consequence. She manages to only make some of them, but the remaining girls take up this little "task".

    -   Tomoyo regularly makes and designs costumes for Sakura to fight in. She custom makes the costumes so they would fit the situation and protect Sakura from whatever the cards throw her.

-   _Gunslinger Girl_. There's a scene where cyborg girl Henrietta (who's treated like a kid sister by her handler) is sewing up her shirt in her dorm room, while Rico (whose handler gave her a man's name and treats her like a weapon) is Gun Stripping her pistol.

-   Early on in _High School D×D_, Issei is stressing out the night before a very important dodgeball game and decides to calm his nerves by... embroidering headbands for his team.

-   _My Dress-Up Darling_: Much of male lead Wakana Gojo's social anxiety comes from a former childhood friend calling him a freak over his love of dolls and dollmaking, and he's horrified when Marin walks in on him using the school's sewing machine out of fear that she'll think less of him for being good at it. Much of his character development comes from Marin helping helping him realize that his interests are just as valid as anyone else's.
-   In the final season of _Ojamajo Doremi_, the girls dive into textile work in order to help break the Big Bad's curses.

-   _Snow White with the Red Hair_: While Kiki was known to like sewing and embroidery no art of the knight doing so was produced outside of an sketch of her doing so while in a dress with very feminine hair as a child until her position as Lady Seiran started making her have to dress like a noblewoman rather than a knight more often, her stoic nature had mellowed and she got engaged, all things which brought out a feminine side of her that wasn't prevalent for the first several volumes.

    Fan Works 

-   _Brainbent_:
    -   Rose and Kanaya both have an interest in textile arts - Rose knits, and Kanaya is a designer and seamstress.
    -   Equius knits as well, although his case is more Real Men Wear Pink. (And he needs to use metal knitting needles because he tends to accidentally break plastic ones.)
-   Later on in the _Gensokyo 20XX_ series, Yukari is mentioned to be knitting or sewing from time to time. Apparently, she has hobbies, if this is any indication.
-   The _Star Trek: The Original Series_ follow-up to "Journey to Babel", All In A Day's Work by the late Johanna Cantor, has Spock's mother handling things for the families of the ambassadors on board. We find that Tellarite women are never named but are called somebody's daughter, somebody's wife, etc., but this doesn't prevent them from having a sense of importance, pride, and ego when it comes to their textile work.
-   _Queens of Mewni_:
    -   Urania, the First Queen, was the daughter of weavers and weaved her own royal outfits and those of her daughters.
    -   Sky, Moon's biological mother, was able to combine her weaving abilities with her magic to make spelled armor and cloth golems. She also, notably, was the one to weave all the tapestries of the queens from Urania to her mother Diana. Fittingly, she is remembered in history as Sky the Weaver. When she found the _real_ Book of Spells and found out Urania had been a weaver as well, she squeaked in shock.
-   Suggested in the _RWBY_ Fanfic _Various Vytal Ventures_ with Blake, who shows she can sew in one chapter, though according to Word of God, learned from Adam, which subverts this.
-   _Vow of Nudity_: Spectra, one of the protagonists, is the daughter of two tailors and loves sewing dresses as her primary hobby. However, her late father who's eventually revealed to be a changeling ex-bandit and a murderous bank robber strays pretty far from this trope.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Brave_: Sewing is one of the many feminine tasks that Queen Elinor tries to teach to her rebellious daughter Merida. It proves to be a Chekhov's Skill as Merida sews the tapestry she symbolically damaged in an attempt to break the spell that turned her mother into a bear.
-   _Chicken Run_: Babs is the most overtly feminine and most ditzy chicken on Tweedy's Farm. Almost always seen with a pair of knitting needles.
-   _Cinderella_: While the mice are prepping Cinderella's pink dress so that she can go to the ball, one female mouse tells Jacques to "leave the sewing to the women!" It's downplayed, though. Given that we later see a male mouse helping sew the dress, it's possible she simply didn't trust _him_ not to screw up with the sewing, as opposed to male mice in general.
-   _Encanto_: Has Mirabel, the youngest daughter of a family where magical Gifts are bestowed on five-year-old children who then begin to become responsible citizens. For some reason, Mirabel received no Gift (and this is where the story really starts), so she's lived all of her fifteen years in the nursery, where she's gotten really, really good at sewing, knitting and especially embroidery. Her clothing is covered with bright symbols of her beloved family.
-   _The Last: Naruto the Movie_ reveals that Naruto's late mother Kushina and future wife Hinata both enjoy knitting scarves.

    -   Two of the thugs in the Snuggly Duckling are into knitting and sewing respectively.
-   In _Your Name_, Mitsuha's grandmother Hitoha is a master of _kumihimo_, the Japanese art of braid making, and she passes on this skill to her granddaughters. Also, Mitsuha (while in Taki's body) uses her sewing skills to mend Miki's skirt, and Miki is impressed, saying she didn't realize that Taki had a feminine side.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Curse of the Golden Flower_: The Empress of China uses this trope as a cover for her political agenda. Her ceaseless embroidering of chrysanthemums is implied to be for the upcoming festival celebrating the flower. In fact, the thousands of stitched scarves are later worn by the army she’s recruited to oust her husband and place her eldest son on the throne.
-   _Demolition Man_: The hero is repeatedly embarrassed that he had been trained in the fine arts of knitting and sewing while in hibernation.
-   _Kopps_: Inverted with Benny the cop, who knits headbands for his colleagues. It's lampshaded by his neighbors.
    
    **Mike**: Shit, you fag, you're knitting!
    
    **Benny**: Why?
    
    **Mike**: My mother knits!
    
    -   And later:
        
        **Ramzi**: My wife knits in home, are you wife?

-   _Phantom Thread_: Played with. Although the workforce in Reynolds Woodcock's fashion house is all female, he is occasionally shown working on garments himself, rather than just designing.
-   _Sightseers_: Tina (one half of an Outlaw Couple) knits. She turns out to have been knitting a bra and crotchless knickers. Kinky!
-   _Suffragette_: This trope is, as befitting the time, played completely straight. Almost all the protagonists who are shown working are laundering clothes (the one exception being a woman who works in her husband's pharmacy)...a not only time-consuming and boring but also very hard and dangerous job. The protagonist's mother died in a work accident. Most women take their infants to work regardless, as they need the money.

Several girls in the Hobbies Club do various crafts as their hobbies.
-   In _The Chronicles of Prydain_, embroidering tapestries is one of the skills Eilonwy is expected to learn as a lady. Like with most of her lessons, she's not too fond of it.

    _People that can afford anything at all, always buy white for little new babies—linen and lace, and the very finest things to be had. There's a young woman living near us who cut up her wedding clothes to have fine things for her baby. Mothers who love and want their babies don't buy little rough, ready-made things, and they don't run up what they make on an old sewing machine. They make fine seams, and tucks, and put on lace and trimming by hand. They sit and stitch, and stitch little, even stitches, every one just as careful. Their eyes shine and their faces glow. When they have to quit to do something else, they look sorry and fold up their work so particularly. There isn't much worth knowing about your mother that those little clothes won't tell. I can see her putting the little stitches into them and smiling with shining eyes over your coming. Freckles, I'll wager you a dollar those little clothes of yours are just alive with the dearest, tiny handmade stitches._

-   In the _Heralds of Valdemar_ novel _Take a Thief_, Skif is mocked by the other boy Trainees for being in the laundry/mending chore section at the Collegium - he'd learned to do it as a thief, as dirty and/or damaged clothing is easier to take without being noticed, and cleaning and mending it before taking it to the fence improves the resale value substantially for zero risk - until he points out that this means he's the only boy in a room full of girls, at which point he is suspected of secret genius.
-   In Rick Riordan's _The Heroes of Olympus_ novel _The Mark of Athena_, Annabeth is put to the test, weaving.
-   In _The House of the Spirits_, Clara's older sister Rosa spends almost all of her time sewing a _massive_ and very complicated tapestry, which worries her mother Nivea as she fears it's all that she will ever be able to do well.

-   In Andre Norton's _Ice Crown_, when the inn maid gives Roane clothes, she mentions they are not a lady's, being her own seaming.

-   _INVADERS of the ROKUJYOUMA!?_: The school's Knitting Club consists solely of the Delicate and Sickly Harumi and male protagonist Koutarou, the latter of whom laments that people probably think he just joined to find a girlfriend. When Harumi's graduation approaches, Koutarou asks one of his female friends to join the club as a figurehead president, believing that first-year girls wouldn't want to join a Knitting Club run by a guy (especially not one with a face as scary as his).
-   _Jane Eyre_:
    -   When Bessie visits adult Jane, she asks about her schooling, and her last question is whether she can work on muslin and canvas. Jane can, and Bessie pronounces her to be quite a lady.
    -   At Lowood school, pupils had to sew and repair their uniforms themselves. Jane later mentions they had bad needles and thread.
    -   Mrs. Fairfax, a housekeeper at Thorfield, often knits.
-   In Susanna Clarke's _Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell_, when the society had to be disbanded, many of the theoretical magicians became nuisances, having nothing to do — and bothered their female relations at their needlework.
-   _The Lady of Shalott_: The poem's heroine is a lady who is eternally weaving the reflections of what she sees outside on her loom.
-   _Little House on the Prairie_: Both Ma and Laura hate sewing, but are still skilled, efficient seamstresses due to this trope (worth noting that the _only_ jobs available to a woman at that time would be teaching and sewing, so they have to take those jobs if they want any chance to make money). At one point, she gets a job helping a woman in town sew shirts for all the bachelors who don't have a wife to do it for them, and the woman comments that Laura beats her sewing buttonholes. The narration explains that Laura hates sewing buttonholes so much, she's learned to do it quickly. The day Pa buys Ma a sewing machine is almost the happiest we ever see her, and when Laura gets innovative with muslin sheets, Ma, normally a traditionalist, only comments, "Our grandmothers would turn in their graves, but after all, these are modern times." By contrast, Laura's sister Mary _does_ seem to enjoy sewing, enough that she learns to do hems and the like by touch after losing her sight.
-   Demonstrated in both Ann Clark's 1943 _Little Navajo Bluebird_ and Margaret Phelps' 1944 _Chia and the Lambs_, both about Navajo girls learning traditional female occupations including sheep herding, preparing wool, and weaving. Both are pretty much Truth in Television although _Bluebird_ has more realism while _Chia_ tends to be Fair for Its Day and strays into Tonto Talk.
-   _Little Women_: When Professor Bhaer comes calling on her family, Jo sits down with her sewing.
-   Inverted in Stephen King's _The Long Walk_: Ray Garraty teaches his girlfriend how to knit. Also, the mill workers in "Graveyard Shift" work in a textile mill (an example of Write What You Know, as King himself worked in a textile mill in high school).
-   In _Mansfield Park_, Fanny and Lady Bertram often do some needlework. Lady Bertram's work is not very useful, nor is it pretty. The ladies also often sew for their neighbourhood charity.
-   In _Daddy-Long-Legs_ sequel _My Dear Enemy_, Sallie expects this trope. She is surprised to learn that Dr. Robin McRae is rather skilled at knitting. He explains that he learned to do it as a teenager in his native Scotland.
-   In _Oak Hill_, Elaine is the sewer. Even Maris borrows a needle from her to do some.
-   _The Odyssey_: Penelope is putting off the suitors with her weaving—not, for once, clothes, but a cloth to be used at her father-in-law's funeral (he is, in fact, still alive). She tears it apart every night and starts again in the morning.
-   In John Hemry's _Paul Sinclair_'s _Burden Of Proof,_ Carl talks of how Paul and Jen have settled down since they started to date; he expects Jen to knit and cook and stuff.
-   In Elizabeth Marie Pope's _The Perilous Gard_, Alicia was always better at sewing than Kate, as well as at general femininity.
-   Mary Renault tells this anecdote about Alexander the Great in _The Persian Boy_: When the Greek army invaded Persia and captured most of the royal family, Alexander brought the royal ladies some yarn for weaving. Only slaves did this in Persia, and when he was informed, he apologized and said his mother and sisters did this all the time and he had wanted to give his hostages something to do. The Queen Mother became his friend after this. This is based on real events, like much of Renault's work; it's in Quintus Curtius. Though how seriously to take anything Curtius said about Alexander is a matter of some debate among historians.
-   In John Bunyan's _Pilgrim's Progress_, Mr. Brisk woos Mercy because she is always sewing until he learns she is sewing not for profit but for the poor.

    -   Elizabeth is sewing when Mr. Darcy asked her father for his permission for them to marry. He needed to speak with her and pretended to be admiring her work.
-   Jessica Day George's _Princess of the Midnight Ball_ plays this: hero Galen is an active knitter, much to the surprise of the women. One comments that they had knitted, and knitted, and knitted for the soldiers, and Galen has to tell her that none of it ever reached him. he actually uses his skills to make the charms that defeat the King Under Stone. He notes that it's a useful skill for a soldier: it helps pass the time and the ability to make a nice warm pair of socks comes in handy.
-   In L. Jagi Lamplighter's _Prospero Lost_, in the Back Story, Eramus had once insulted Miranda by saying her lack of womanly talents showed a deficiency of character, and Theo thrashed him for it. Miranda learned the skill and embroidered a unicorn for Theo. In the current day of the story, he still has it.
-   In _The Red Tent_, Jacob's wives are all seen working on textiles in some capacity. Zilpah and Bilhah are said to be especially good at it. Bilhah tells Dinah a "Just So" Story about how women learned spinning and weaving from a goddess named Enhenduanna, and Bilhah's "personal goddess" is Uttu, also associated with weaving. After Bilhah receives a beating for her affair with Reuben, a major tip-off that something in her has changed is that the thread she spins gradually becomes thinner and thinner before she runs away.
-   In Hobby Webb's _Rose And The Magicians Mask_, Miss Fell uses knitting in magic at one point to save Mr. Fountain's life. Later, she examines Rose and critically observes that as a man, Mr. Fountain is not teaching her what a proper young lady and magician should know; she should know how to embroider, both for propriety and because she will find it useful.
-   Plutarch: In _Sayings of Spartan Women_, this is inverted when an Ionian woman showed off her valuable weaving, and a Spartan woman pointed to her four sons, well-behaved: "Such should be the employments of the good and honourable woman, and it is over these that she should be elated and boastful." (For context: Freeborn Spartan women and men were all staunchly Idle Rich, and they viewed essentially all production-related jobs as "peasant labor.")
-   _Silas Marner_ (subtitled "The Weaver of Raveloe"): Inverted. Silas makes beautiful linen, really loves his work and you can hear his loom going day and night.
-   In _Solstice Wood_, the Fiber Guild is all female. Iris explains it's a sewing circle, really. They actually work textile magic to contain the Fair Folk.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: Feminine Sansa can embroider beautifully, and tomboyish Arya is always avoiding it. In an ironic reference to the pastime she hated so much, when she's given a sword she names it "Needle".
-   _A Tale of Two Cities_: Features Madame Defarge and her fellow female revolutionaries during the Reign of Terror, who sit beside the guillotine and encode the names of the executed into their sewing patterns. This is based on the real-life tricoteuses who famously knitted beside the guillotine so casually.

-   _Tinker_'s _Wolf Who Rules_: Tinker thinks about how wives do the laundry and even have discussions about how to get grass stains out.
-   In Tolkien's Legendarium's works, all the mentioned textile workers are women. Vairë (the title of one of the Valier) means "weaver"; and Luthien, Galadriel, and Arwen are all accomplished weavers. As with other elven crafts, there is a magical element to their work (Luthien's cloak is the most explicitly magical, as she is by far the most powerful). Much more significantly, Fëanor's mother Miriel is said to be highly skilled in sewing, embroidery and "other skills requiring finesse": even by the standards of the highly artistic Noldor. She ends up working for the aforementioned Vairë weaving the stories of the House of Finwë. Which is what the Legendarium basically is (the only one of the stories that has nothing to do with a member of Finwë's extended family is _The Hobbit_). In one story, Tolkien tells of a 9th Century Anglo-Saxon lord who becomes stranded on Tol Eressëa and writes down the stories that Tolkien claims to have "translated" based off of Miriel's tapestries and the recollections of the elves living on that island. So the "real version" of Tolkien's Legendarium, is actually the work of Miriel: but we have to be content with the written version since we can't go to Valinor.
-   _Tortall Universe:_
    -   _Song of the Lioness_ has a few female mages working with thread and string. Alanna, who crossdressed for years to become a knight, learns to do this, and some normal spinning as relaxation.
        -   One of Alanna's more downplayed awesome moments come from her male mage student proclaiming this trope in a sexist manner. Alanna immediately proves him wrong with the thread magic.
    -   Kel is surprised to learn that Raoul is a skilled seamster in _Protector of the Small_, but as a bachelor knight, he's the only one who _would_ be sewing his clothes.
    -   Also used in _Beka Cooper_. Beka's younger sisters are both being trained in sewing by Lady Teodorie, and Beka is quite good herself. She is surprised to learn in _Bloodhound_ not that Goodwin sews (which is a standard skill for a medieval woman) but that she _embroiders_.
-   Subverted in _The Wheel of Time_. Most female protagonists are Aes Sedai, and when Aes Sedai speak of 'weaving,' they're really talking about magic and/or casting spells (for example, a fire spell is referred to as a 'fire weave'.)
-   Alex's mother in _When Women Were Dragons_ conforms very closely with middle-class American 1950's femininity. Part of her femininity is expressed in her careful sewing, knitting, and decorative knotwork. The knots in particular are also relevant to her mathematical work and family tradition.
-   In _With a Tangled Skein_, Niobe is a skilled weaver. Her textile skills come in handy when she becomes an Aspect of Fate.
-   In Xenophon's account, he depicts Socrates explaining to a man that he could get his female relatives in his household to do textile work, and support them on proceeds. He also has him point out that where spinning wool is in question, the women are the authorities and so are treated as such.

    **Mike:** Don't say it.

Jemaine suggests weaving, but Bret responds that weaving is a man's game, noting that he, his father, and his grandfather all weave. (Slightly off-topic: Later, Bret suggests women's rights, and Jemaine says that _that_ is a man's thing, noting that his father is a women's rights activist who would never allow his wife to become engaged in such activism.)
-   _Game of Thrones_: The Establishing Character Moment for the two Stark daughters — Sansa Stark is praised for her needlework, while Arya Stark runs out of the classroom to take part in archery. Sansa is also shown to be a proficient embroiderer, furrier, and leatherworker and is responsible for making her own clothes as well as items for other characters. Later Arya is given a sword which she names Needle in acknowledgement of her desire to be a great warrior instead. Subverted in Season Four when Littlefinger points out to Sansa Stark that She Is All Grown Up and no longer The Ingenue... at the time Sansa is sewing what is later revealed to be her Evil Costume Switch.
-   In _Gilmore Girls_, Lorelai is very skilled at sewing. She makes impressive costumes for various town festivals and she frequently changes her or Rory's dress.

-   In an early episode of _Home Improvement_, Brad joins a sewing class purely in order to meet girls. Unfortunately, this backfires on him; his classmates find out what he's doing and join the class too, meaning it winds up being a class full of guys and he's still stuck sewing.
    
    **Tim:** Brad, I'd love to help you, but I've got a drawer full of socks that need darning!
    
    -   Later on, the idea winds up being subverted when Brad is seen working on his project at home while dealing with Randy and Mark teasing him.

-   In _Oshin_, one of the businesses that the protagonist Shin "Oshin" Tanemura takes up is a textile and clothes-making one handled by her and her husband Ryuuzo.

-   In the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Mudd's Women", sewing is one skill that ought to be considered above looks.
    
    **Eve**: Is this the kind of wife you want, Ben? Not someone to help you, not a wife to cook and sew and cry and need, but this kind. Selfish, vain, useless. Is this what you really want?
    
-   in _Xena: Warrior Princess_, embroidery is one of Xena's many skills.

    Mythology & Legends 

-   Classical Mythology
    -   The Three Fates spin, measure, and cut thread in their determination of lives.
    -   A young woman named Arachne claimed she was better at weaving than the goddess Athena, who is so pissed off (since yanno, Pride is one of the worse sins a human could ever commit) that she comes round to challenge Arachne to a contest or "weave-off". When Arachne loses she's so upset she hangs herself, so Athena turns her into a spider. In other versions, Athena was still upset but wanted to give Arachne a last chance before she damned herself and did so under the disguise of an old woman, but Arachne was so arrogant that she blew Athena's warnings off and then came the challenge with the same disastrous results. In another version of the story, the victor was unclear, but Athena curses Arachne because the latter's weaving was blasphemous/insulting to the Olympians (some versions say that the weaving was critical of the gods' entitledness/rampant sexual misconduct). Other versions say that Arachne's weaving was indeed better, but that she was a Sore Winner, and/or Athena was a Sore Loser, so Athena cursed her.
    -   Princess Philomela of Athens wove a tapestry with pictures showing the Trauma Conga Line that had happened to her — her older sister Procne's husband, King Thereus of Thracia, had raped her, cut out her tongue, _and_ locked her away. She then gave the tapestry to a servant as a gift for the queen, which let Procne know about Philomela's Break the Cutie process. It went From Bad to Worse immediately afterwards.
    -   During the Roman kingdom, once the men bet about their wives, back at Rome, and return to find all of them but Lucretia were partying; she was weaving with her maids.

    -   One of the times Hercules was enslaved, he was made to learn how to spin yarn. It was intended to be humiliating, but he found out that he liked it and was good at it.
    -   In _The Achilleid_, Thetis speaks about Hercules' time sewing and working with wool as if doing so was just as feminine as Jupiter literally turning into a woman.
    -   Penelope, wife of Odysseus and a symbol of monogamy, wove a funeral shroud every day for three years and ripped it out.

    Poetry 

-   The Chinese poem _The Ballad of Mulan_ starts with Mulan weaving while lamenting that her father was too old to serve in the army and her brother was too young to take his place, which prompted her to do just that. There are deleted scenes from the Disney film that depicted her working at a loom, most likely as a reference to the original ballad.
-   In William Shakespeare's _The Rape of Lucrece_, Lucrece, following the legend, is spinning while other women are reveling.
    
    _During which siege the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son, in their discourses after supper, every one commended the virtues of his own wife; among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife Lucretia. In that pleasant humour they all posted to Rome; and intending, by their secret and sudden arrival, to make trial of that which every one had before avouched, only Collatinus finds his wife, though it were late in the night, spinning amongst her maids: the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or in several disports._
    

    Theatre

-   The title character in _Lysistrata_ has a long speech in which she compares the management of a state to the preparation of wool for weaving, to make the point that women have a stake in the way the government is run.

-   In _Mariana Pineda_ by Federico García Lorca, the title character embroidering a liberal slogan on a flag is an important plot point.

-   Played with in _Persona 4_. Kanji Tatsumi enjoys doing textile work and is very talented in doing it, since his mother is the owner of the local textile shop.

Obviously, his social link then revolves around this and him dealing with all of this.
-   In _Shepherd's Crossing 2,_ the marriage customs of the town state that a woman who wishes to propose to a man must knit him a handmade blanket. If you're playing as a female PC and wish to complete the Romance Sidequest, you must shear, spin, and knit lots of wool in order to get married.

-   In _No Evil_ Kajortoq is probably the most feminine of the spirits and she spends a lot of time sewing and weaving. She even enchants some of her work, like the poppy-embroidered ponchos that keep the cold-blooded spirits warm in winter and some saddle-blankets that she promises the jackalope salesman will make the jackalopes that wear them equal to his best animal (too bad for him that he tries to hoist off an unruly beast as "his best animal" in exchange for them).
-   _Welcome to Sanditon_: Ladies of Sanditon organize a craft night once a week, and the first thing they did when Gigi arrived was some weird knitted potholder.

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: In _The Warriors of Kyoshi_, Katara is mending a tear in Sokka's pants, but when he starts spouting sexist rhetoric about girls being better at sewing than boys, she puts on a contrary smile and throws the garment back in his face, unfinished.
-   _Ed, Edd n Eddy_: In _Momma's Little Ed_, Edd is shown mending curtains at his mother's request, which causes Eddy to suppress his obvious laughter and call the task "girl stuff".
-   _Ewoks_: In the second season, when all the characters are implied to be studying to become something, Latara is a "hoodmaker apprentice". This is later mentioned in her introduction card for the _Shadows of Endor_ comic, with a mention that she designed her unusual hood by herself. link<small>◊</small>
-   _Gravity Falls_: Mabel Pines is very much a Girly Girl and knitting cute, colorful sweaters is one of her hobbies. She can be seen periodically working on new sweaters throughout the series.
-   _Il était une fois..._: The The Roaring '20s episode has Pierre as a mechanic/car builder and his girlfriend Pierrette as a seamstress and fashion designer.
-   _The Loud House_: Leni is an aspiring fashion designer who makes most of her own clothing and one of the most feminine of the Loud sisters.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   Rarity is considerably the most feminine of the mane 6. She designs and sews her own fashions.
    -   Even the second place for the most feminine, Fluttershy, turns out to have "freaky knowledge" about sewing.
        -   In the micro-series comics, Fluttershy has an 'Extreme Knitting' hobby, which she treats as a Guilty Pleasure. Her cottage has a secret room behind a bookcase, _full_ of objects such as 'cups' for chickens to sit on, parasprites, butterflies, birds, books, dragons... every single one of them made through knitting.
-   Averted in _The Owl House_, where the only two characters who are ever shown with an affinity for sewing are Darius and Hunter, neither of whom are ever treated as being unmanly for it. Then again, most forms of discrimination flat out don't exist on the Boiling Isles, so the idea of traditional gender roles is probably a foreign concept.
-   _The Simpsons_: There's an episode where Marge tells Lisa about a quilt that her female ancestors have contributed to for decades. Marge added a patch that said "Keep On Truckin'" but she didn't understand what it meant.
-   _South Park_: In one episode the boys all take shop & the girls all take home ec. (Kenny manages to get himself placed in the Home Ec class because there's a lower risk of getting killed there.)
    
    **Mr. Adler:** Now, does anybody know _why_ you're in shop class?  
    **Stan:** Because we had to choose between this and Home Ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?
    
-   _Work It Out Wombats!_: In "Gift For a Fish," Ellie, a woman, knits a hammock for the baby fish.

    Real Life 

-   In ancient Rome, the women of the family would come out to the central courtyard to do their textile work as the patron of the family dealt with clients. (By being thus visible, they were demonstrating that the family had nothing to hide.)
    -   "She worked wool" is found inscribed on many a Roman woman's tombstone as a sort of shorthand for old fashioned feminine virtue. Especially if she were from a high enough social class that she would have slave-girls to do that work.
-   Zigzagged in certain parts of the Arab World and India: there, most of the process of making new clothes — particularly weaving — has always been men's work among city people; weavers generally made cloth for themselves as well as to sell; tailors would generally buy cloth from weavers to make their own clothes as well as taking a fee for mending clothes and making new garments out of cloth third parties had bought from weavers. However, laundry was still women's work, as were minor repairs. And in the countryside, duties shifted to the women (as the men had to tend to crops and livestock) — although to what degree depended on how far away you were from town (a farmer relatively close to a fairly large urban center might purchase new cloth and clothing in town, but have his wife do repairs).
-   A major historical exception to this is Britain, particularly England, as the textile industry was one of the largest in the country for hundreds of years. Male English artisans were famous across Europe for their high-quality textiles for centuries, and the continuous British attempts to increase the quality and quantity of textile output led in part to the Industrial Revolution, with English inventors inventing the flying shuttle, the spinning jenny, the water frame, the spinning mule, and finally, the power loom in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Lord Speaker in the House of Lords still sits on a stuffed-wool cushion called the Woolsack, as a symbol of the importance of the British wool trade. The Woolsack dates back to the 14th century.
-   In pre-industrial Britain and elsewhere in Europe, weaving was an activity typically performed in private homes rather than dedicated workshops, and the weavers were often male. This is probably why "Weaver" is a fairly common surname in English: it would be a trade handed down from father to son.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Not for nothing is the oldest Livery Company in London the Worshipful Company of Weavers. Similar things can be said about spinners and tailors (again "Spinner" and "Tailor" and variants are common surnames).
    -   And, ironically enough, Taylor is now a popular _female_ name.
    -   Part of the reason weaving can be either feminine or masculine is because most men had larger reaches than women and therefore could make larger bolts of cloth on a given loom, which was a BIG bonus in preindustrial societies; another reason is that the task is atually very physical and needs a LOT of upper-body strength and endurance, especially once the looms started scaling up and getting more (and heavier) moving parts.
-   Spinsters were almost always women, and the modern use of the word to mean "woman who has never been married" (with the implication she's reached an undesirable age) _does_ derive from the fact that they were usually women who'd failed to marry and had to support themselves (and as single women had little legal status, they didn't have many options. It's also never seen as a surname as women couldn't pass on their names and spinsters would generally be childless anyway). The actual assembly of clothes, right up until the sewing machine in the late 19th century, usually depended on the gender the clothes were intended for — tailoring was a respected profession, but ladies wouldn't like to think a man had handled their "smallclothes"! (And women of all walks of life made simple garments, like shirts, at home.) Furthermore, 'Webster' — also a common name — means a specifically female weaver.
-   In Elizabethan England, more knitters were men, as they had to be in a guild. This was related to sumptuary laws, as only nobility were allowed to wear certain types of knits (gloves and stockings). When Elizabeth found this out, she changed the laws to allow more common people to have employment options.
-   Opus Anglicanum; embroideries created by mostly male artisans which were highly treasured throughout Christendom. The most famous example of such needlework would be the Bayeaux Tapestry.
-   A common inversion: Soldiers all over the world are taught how to sew as part of Basic Training. As a soldier, one is responsible for the care and maintenance of one's gear, and that includes the uniform.
-   Another modern inversion: knitting and other needlework is sometimes used as anger management training by occupational therapists...in prisons.
-   In pagan Scandinavian graves, textile implements are found mostly in women's graves — cooking items were also more common in women's graves, but not by nearly so large a proportion.
-   In some Nordic cultures, the work of textile production was divided among men and women, each carrying out their own assigned stages of the process. Mostly this was to make efficient use of every available pair of hands during the long months when both men and women were isolated in their homes by deep snow, with nothing better to do.
-   A learned young woman was presented at the court of James I and praised for her knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He asked, "Can she spin?"
-   An aversion can be found in the history of Swaledale in North Yorkshire, where both lead mining and knitting were forms of income. There are indications that as well as women knitting, male lead miners would also knit to supplement their income, according to stories even doing it on the way to work.
-   This is being subverted more and more often in recent years as the textile arts inch ever closer to nonexistence. While the majority of spinners, weavers, knitters, and tailors/seamstresses are female, the number of men who actively engage in these arts and work to master it is steadily increasing. The art of drop spinning, for example, has reached a point of such obscurity that a man seen using a drop spindle is more likely to be viewed on the level of "eccentric master of an ancient art" than "a guy who does girl stuff."
-   There are also plenty of Men Who Knit. Guys even made their own "pussy hats" to wear as allies during the 2016-17 women's marches. In recent Olympic Games you can see male athletes and coaches — Antti Koskinen, Roope Tonteri and Tom Daley among them — knitting to de-stress.
-   Navajo weaving both plays this straight and inverts it. The popular image of a Navajo weaver is female, but that was partially imposed by the standards of incoming Christian Anglos. Gender roles don't work that way in Navajo culture, so male weavers are perfectly acceptable. The weaving tradition is much more nuanced and complex than Anglos are led to believe. Anglo culture values Navajo weaving as art and/or skilled craft, and many books have been written about the history and designs, but its spiritual significance has been glossed over as a cute fairy tale about spiders. Thousands of women and men who created these textiles were glossed over as non-working housewives or retirees weaving as a leisure activity. In reality, the money earned kept families and communities alive. The work was usually sold to a trading post, which often bought textiles by weight, then put a huge markup on it for the Anglo market, the creators receiving smaller and smaller percentages. Today, Indian-run fair trade co-ops<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  help weavers sell their creations directly rather than through an intermediary and educate the public, recontextualizing the work in terms of its spiritual significance as well as to the livelihood of the Dine people.
