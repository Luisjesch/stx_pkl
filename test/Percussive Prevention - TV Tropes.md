**Jessica Rabbit:** Oh, no! Where's Roger?  
**Eddie Valiant:** Roger? He chickened out on me back at the studio.  
**Jessica Rabbit:** No, he didn't. I hit him on the head with a frying pan and stuffed him in the trunk. So he wouldn't get hurt.  
**Eddie Valiant:** Makes perfect sense.

Bob is about to do something that Charlie considers stupid — attempting a Heroic Sacrifice, becoming The Bait, otherwise putting himself in danger, or about to act like a Leeroy Jenkins. Charlie could try to reason with Bob and persuade him not to go, but he takes a much faster and more direct option.

He punches Bob in the jaw. (The gut and/or solar plexus are also popular areas.)

Nine times out of ten, this will put Bob out like a light, but even when it doesn't it still subdues him long enough for Charlie to take his place or forcibly remove him from danger. Bob may be cursing and raging (or even attempting to return the punch), but Charlie will brush him off and insist that he only did what he had to do.

A subtrope of Cruel to Be Kind, since this sort of treatment _hurts_, even if it saves Bob from worse. Since one hero attacking another looks _really_ bad out of context, this is a common source of Superdickery.

See Kind Restraints for a softer version of this. Compare Percussive Shutdown when this tactic is used against an object rather than a character. Can result in Percussive Therapy if the recipient of the hit has been a source of frustration for the person doing the hitting. A common reason for this is that the character punching you out is More Expendable Than You. Compare Get A Hold Of Yourself Man, Dope Slap, Saved From Their Own Honor and Don't Say Such Stupid Things!.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Angel Sanctuary_ an already dying Kira punches Katou in the stomach in order to essentially commit suicide. Or maybe it was just a case of Taking the Bullet.
-   _Bleach_
    -   While getting Orihime away from the scene of a battle between Uryu Ishida and Captain Kurotsuchi, a Soul Reaper knocks her out to keep her from going back to help Uryu.
    -   When Ichigo tried to confront Captain Kuchiki outside Rukia's place of imprisonment, Yoruichi rendered him unconscious and escaped with him. She knew he wasn't strong enough to fight Captain Kuchiki yet and would just get himself killed.
    -   Used again with Orihime and Chad during the Fullbringer arc. Urahara and Isshin were able to knock out Chad and Orihime since they were kinda distracted while Tsukishima was busy Mind Raping them.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   In _Dragon Ball Z_, Vegeta knocks Goku, Trunks and Goten out (in that order) to keep them from fighting Buu.
    -   In the alternate future, Future Gohan knocks Trunks out to keep him from fighting the androids. By the time Trunks wakes up, Gohan is already dead.
-   In _Eyeshield 21_, Homer punches Panther in the face to prevent him from attacking their racist coach, which would get him kicked off the team and possibly out of the school. In a later episode, Tetsuma smacks Monta around to keep him from going ballistic on the referee and getting his team thrown out of the Fall Tournament.
-   Used occasionally in _Fairy Tail_, usually by Gray and Natsu on each other when one of them is too injured to fight but too stubborn not to. Erza also employs this on Natsu once to save him the pain of crippling motion sickness.
    -   Natsu inverts this on Erza, knocking her out with a punch to the stomach in order to fight Jellal for her.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_ has Onizuka put bossy, self-righteous Vice-Principal Uchiyamada in a German Suplex for trash-talking some angry delinquents he'd had expelled from school. Which pacifies the delinquents and prevents them from doing anything _worse_ to Uchiyamada.
-   In _Inuyasha_, the "sharp shot to the solar plexus" move was once used by Miroku to subdue a peasant girl whom he was trying to move to safety.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders_:
    -   Kakyoin shoots Polnareff with an Emerald Splash to knock him out of the way of Hol Horse's bullet. It happens again much later on: when Vanilla Ice is about to ambush the party of Avdol, Polnareff, and Iggy, Avdol smacks the latter two out of the way at the cost of his own life.
    -   Polnareff knocks Kakyoin out when his attempts at telling the others that the Mannish Baby is one of Dio's minions forces him to try and make it expose its true colors. It ends up working in their favor since it allowed Kakyoin to bring his Stand to the dream world.
-   Happened to _Naruto_ in the second movie.
    -   In the main series, Hiashi Hyuga's twin brother Hizashi knocks him out with a punch to the solar plexus in order to take his place as a human sacrifice.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Luffy knocks out Mayor Boodle when the old man tries to challenge Buggy the Clown. Later Luffy violently forces Johnny and Yosaku down to stop them interfering during Zoro one-sided duel with Mihawk. Much later in the Dressrosa he knocks out Bellamy, effectively saving him from Domflamingo.
    -   Nami does this to boy in her village. When he wants to avenge his father who Arlong killed, Nami whacks him down with her staff. Usually Nami wouldn't dream of hurting a child but in this case she was protecting him. Even when pretending to be evil she's still a Mama Bear. Later she pretends to stab Usopp to fool Arlong and save his life.
    -   Doctor Kureha also uses these methods to keep patients from doing anything that will worsen their condition or even make them incurable. She violently floored Sanji to keep him from further injuring his back and paralyzing himself.
    -   Sanji himself does this to Usopp in Skypeia, kicking him out of the way Enel's lighting blast which would've undoubtedly vaporized Usopp. Sanji on the other hand decided to take the blast himself. Later in Water 7, Sanji floors Chopper in his Heavy form to restrain him from getting involved in Luffy and Usopp's duel.
        -   Much later in Zou Sanji nearly breaks his chivalry when he physically throws Nami, Chopper and Brook to safety out of Bege's body. Though he does tell them to watch their heads as they land.
    -   In Thriller Bark, Zoro knocks Sanji out to keep Sanji from possibly sacrificing his life to a high-powered government thug in Luffy's place. Before that Zoro is often shown violently shoving Nami out of harm's way like in Alabasta and in Foxy filler.
-   In the initial arc of _Saint Seiya_, when Shun and Shiryu confront Ikki to retrieve remainder of the Gold Cloth he stole, Shun knocks Shiryu unconscious (in the anime, he simply wraps Shiryu head-to-toe in his chains) to prevent him from interfering with resolving his family affairs (namely, Shun plans to let Ikki kill him; it's complicated). It fails because Hyoga (with a gaping hole in his chest) and Seiya show up just in time.
-   In _Sengoku Basara_ at one point Masamune gets injured during the fight with Nobunaga. He faints while riding away on his horse (don't ask) and his faithful retainer, Kojuro, gets him to safety. But when some of Masamune's men gets kidnapped, Masamune wakes up at the worst possible time and overhears the news. He insists on rescuing his men despite his weakened state, while Kojuro attempts to stop him. The two battle a bit, then Kojuro takes advantage of Masamune's still sensitive wound and knocks his lord out with a blade hilt to the head. One of the men who had managed to escape the kidnapping (and whom delivered the news) yells at Kojuro, asking him why he did that. Kojuro doesn't respond, but it's clear by the look in his eyes that his actions were done out of a deep love and sense of duty towards Masamune. Kojuro then borrows Masamune's swords, promising to rescue the kidnapped men himself.
-   Done a few times in _Sgt. Frog_, like in episode 2 where Keroro drops about a dozen metal wash basins on Momoka's head to stop her from pelting Tamama with volleyballs... and thus prevent her from provoking Tamama into retaliating violently.
-   _Vampire Hunter D_. In the 1985 movie, when danger approaches Doris Lang's house she volunteers to fight alongside D. D uses the talking mouth on his hand to put her to sleep so she can resist Count Magnus Lee's summons.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ has the first duel between The Pharaoh and Dark Bakura. Dark Bakura has just set Man-Eater Bug in defense mode (read, anything that attacks it sets off its ability, which kills any monster on the field, and it's set to go off next turn anyway). Tristan attempts to attack it and take the ability to save his friends. This earns him a sword hilt to the stomach, courtesy of Flame Swordsman!Joey, who proceeds to do it himself.

    Comic Books

    -   When Barbara Gordon revealed to Cassandra Cain that she knew about both the murder she committed as a child and the death duel with Lady Shiva which she was fully intending to throw planned for that very night she stated that she was going to put a stop to the latter (presumably by calling in backup).

-   Daredevil kicks the new White Tiger off a building so she won't try to fight Bullseye.
-   During a Walt Simonson arc of the _Fantastic Four_, Reed Richards refuses to escape from a site targeted for imminent destruction without rescuing Sue and Johnny first, prompting Ben Grimm to knock him out and cart him off to safety. After the place blows up and (apparently) kills the Storms, Reed predictably flips out at Ben, who justifies his actions in an unexpected reversal of their usual Red Oni, Blue Oni roles by reminding Reed that while the two of _them_ would would have gladly died rather than leave Sue and Johnny behind, the entire universe is about to be annihilated and without Reed, the others along for the ride — Thor, Iron Man, and Ms. Marvel — would have no chance in hell of saving it.
-   In _Green Arrow_ #24, Shado knocks Green Arrow to prevent him going to fight Count Vertigo while injured, then goes to fight Vertigo herself.

-   In _Nintendo Power_ Comics' version of the Star Fox story, Falco knocks out Fox to prevent him from attempting to fly though the black hole, and offers to go in his place, arguing that Fox is a better dogfighter, but he \[Falco\] is a better pilot.

    -   In one of the very few times that he hits a woman, Marv does this to Wendy in order to spare her from watching him torture her sister's killer to death, something that would "give her nightmares."
    -   Lucille, Marv's parole officer, does the same to Marv earlier on to stop him from fighting the cops after the escape from the farm, saying that she's not going to let him get either of them killed. Unfortunately for Lucille, the cops sent to the farm turn out to be a death squad who proceed to murder Lucille after she tells them what she knows.
-   During Walt Simonson's run on _Thor_, Thor, Balder and Skurge (a former Thor villain known as the Executioner) lead an army of souls in a daring escape from Hel, the Norse underworld. The souls must cross the bridge of Gjallerbru, with an army of demon warriors on their heels. Thor orders Balder to lead the souls to escape while he holds the bridge. Skurge knocks Thor out and tells Balder, "You and Thor have a drink when you are next in Asgard and laugh Skurge's last laugh together. I will hold the bridge." Skurge then holds the bridge with two M-16s, going down in an absolutely classic Dying Moment of Awesome. Or, to quote the closing narrative;
    
    _They sing no songs in Hel, nor do they celebrate heroes. For silent is that dismal realm and cheerless._
    
    _But the story of the Gjallerbru and the lone god who defended it is whispered across the Nine Worlds. And when a new arrival asks about the one to whom even Hela bows her head, the answer is always the same._
    
    _He stood alone at Gjallerbru. And that answer is enough._

    Films — Animation 

-   _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_: Jessica Rabbit hits her husband Roger with a frying pan to keep him out of harm's way. It _does_ make perfect sense in Roger's case; as he's a Toon, physical violence will only temporarily incapacitate him. The villains, however, are using Dip, which _can_ kill him.

    -   At the climax of _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_, the Enterprise's warp engines are damaged, and repairing them would require exposing someone to large amounts of radiation. Spock immediately heads to the engine room to try to make the repairs himself. McCoy attempts to stop him, but Spock nerve-pinches him and ends up sacrificing his life so the crew can survive.
    -   Echoed in the new movie _Star Trek Into Darkness_, where Kirk thumps Scotty and straps him into a chair before going into the core himself.

-   _They Live!_ has a scene similar to this, in which two barely acquainted people proceed to beat the _crap_ out of each other for a _full five minutes_ over one getting the other to put on a pair of sunglasses that let the wearer detect all the hidden brainwashing messages in popular media. This is largely Fanservice: one of the characters was played by Roddy Piper, and they were doubtless expecting a lot of pro wrestling fans to be watching.
-   In _The Thin Man_ (from 1934!), Nick punches Nora out cold to get himself (and her, and Asta) out of a sticky situation. She's not too happy when she comes to, but she lets him off the hook when he explains. Then they have a drink together.

    Literature

-   _Able Team_. In _Army of Devils_, Carl Lyons does a mild version, shoving his Action Girlfriend off a helicopter just before it takes off. He should have knocked her out instead, because she gets pissed-off and commandeers another helicopter, which flies right into an RPG-7 rocket.
-   An instance of this trope can be considered the Point of Divergence in the _Arcia Chronicles_, which then has contained a pretty faithful Fantasy Conflict Counterpart of Wars of the Roses. Namely, during the Battle of Graza (Bosworth), Alexander Tagere's (Richard III) final Self-Destructive Charge is cut short by his Best Friend Raphael Kerna knocking him out and hoisting his body over a horse that'd carry him out of the melee. Thus, Alexander survives where Richard died.

-   Near the end of _Deadhouse Gates_, the second book of the _Malazan Book of the Fallen_, Icarium is about to wreak havoc to the Azath and, in consequence, either be trapped by it or let all the beasties it's already trapped run free, so his friend Mappo just whacks him over the head. Ya know, just in case. It works.
-   _Deathstalker_: Captain John Silence insists he's going down with his ship, and there's nothing Investigator Frost can say to change his mind. She agrees, then knocks him out with one punch.
-   _Discworld_: Vimes does this in _Night Watch_ at one point to stop his younger self from getting himself killed.
    -   In _Wintersmith_, Tiffany's father is prevented from throwing himself into a bonfire by bystanders, who'd been watching him in case the fuel ran out, as he thought it would mean both his daughter and her patient would freeze.

    -   The original was in "Prophecy Girl", wherein after Buffy has her 10-Minute Retirement over her prophesied death and the associated She's Back moment, Giles tells her _he_ is going to face the Master in her stead, and "there's nothing you can say that can change my mind." Buffy replies that she knows, and then roundhouse punches him. Thud.
    -   Later, Giles' "unfortunate tendency to get knocked on the head" by friends and foes alike becomes a bit of a Running Gag.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "The Ark in Space": The Doctor and Rogin, a space technician, need to decide who stays and gets killed when the rocket they're working on blasts off.

Thankfully (though embarrassingly), one of the charging warriors under his command accidentally whacks him upside the head with his hammer, rendering him unconscious for the remainder of the battle.
    -   Played straight when Sandor Clegane does this to Arya when she tries to get to her family just as they're being massacred by the Freys and Boltons.
        
        **Clegane:** It's too late. _\[Bam!\]_
        
-   In _Highlander: The Series_, Methos once shot Duncan in the heart to keep him from participating in a duel where he was sure to get killed. This being _Highlander_, Duncan was none too pleased when he healed up.
-   _Horatio Hornblower_ (1998 – 2003) has two examples from "The Even Chance" (AKA "The Duel"):
    -   Mr Midshipman Clayton knocks Mr Midshipman Hornblower out with a tiller just before Hornblower is due to go fight a duel with Mr Midshipman Simpson, taking his place as his second. He thinks that as an older and more senior officer, it's him who should deal with Simpson, not Hornblower who is just a boy in his eyes. Simpson is wounded, Clayton is gutshot, living just long enough for Hornblower to come round, reach the shore and listen to his Last Words.
    -   Later in the same episode, when Mr. Midshipman Kennedy is suffering a seizure while they attempt to sneak up on a French warship, Mr. Midshipmen Hornblower gives him a Tap on the Head, before leaving the unconscious man in the boat while they board the ship. Mr. Midshipman Simpson casts the boat adrift and we don't see the man again until two episodes later.

Keller wants to confess to the crime instead so that Beecher won't become a target. Beecher tells him no. Keller knocks Beecher out so that Beecher can't stop him from taking credit for the murder and then runs off to do so.
-   _Primeval_: In the Season 2 finale, Stephen swings a punch at Cutter to stop the latter from locking himself in Leek's cage room with an army of creatures in an effort to contain them. Then Stephen locks himself in the room before Cutter recovers from the blow, playing this trope very straight.
-   In the _Red Dwarf_ episode "Dimension Jump", Ace Rimmer does this to Kryten to stop him going out in heavy rain to fix the ship. (Kryten isn't waterproof and hence would be damaged.)
-   Most everybody in _Smallville_. Do they have a trauma ward in that hospital?

    -   In "The End", when Present Dean discovers Future Dean is going to feed his own friends into a meat grinder for the sake of his last-ditch desperate attempt to kill the Bad Future version of Lucifer, Present Dean makes it clear that he's willing to put a stop to it here and now rather than let Future Dean defeat Lucifer _this_ way.

-   In the early days of _Dungeons & Dragons Online_, the "Threnal" quest chain was infamous for a hold-the-line quest wherein you needed to protect an NPC who liked nothing better than to charge every group of monsters — and consequently draw too much aggro and get himself killed.

-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_ has a magic-based variant. While Sharing a Body with Lalli, Emil becomes extremely vulnerable to a type of Compelling Voice that Lalli can resist, but not override if someone else falls victim to it. Lalli's preferred method to keep Emil from getting lured into deadly traps by the voice is to instead use magic to either give him a headache so crippling that his body can't move or outright drag his mind into the dream/spirit realm (which causes his physical body to outright collapse).
