_"Charity has become so industrialized now that a bunch of rich assholes can throw a charity ball, charge $5,000 a head, and spend most of that cash on caviar-spewing ice sculptures. I can't trust charities anymore. Like a wino, I just expect them to take my twenty bucks and spend it on MD 20/20."_

People can be persuaded to give money to strangers surprisingly easily, if they believe that the money is going to a good cause — like a charity organization. Jerkasses and bad guys will often take advantage of this by claiming to be collecting for a charity, when the fact is, they're keeping the money themselves. A Con Man may also use a fake charity, or lie about being a representative of a real one, as the tale to help part a fool and his new money.

From easiest to most involved and labor-intensive, the most common forms are:

-   The collector makes up an impressive-sounding, deceptive, or un-informative name, but there's no organization at all. He _may_ hand-draw a label for a collection can. These generally don't produce a lot of money, but they can be trotted out pretty much whenever the conman feels like it — all he needs to do is come up with a new name (and make a new label.)
-   The collector holds a fundraiser for something (rare, weird or non-existent diseases are a favorite). This version can rake in a lot of cash in a very short time, but has a limited replay utility.
-   The collector creates the appearance of a legitimate organization: he has stationery or business cards made, along with the collection can labels. He may rent a bare-bones (desk-and-telephone) office, and might even have a P.O. Box in place of the can labels, or even a website that can receive donations. At this level, he may also convince well-meaning innocents to do collecting for him. These tend to have a limited lifespan, although they may become the next stage:
-   The collector actually creates an organization. This level requires both accomplices and dupes. The office will be convincing, with accomplices playing secretaries and co-workers. Dupes may be employed as collectors or office help. The one place dupes will _never_ be used is in any position where they have access to the bookkeeping records.

Besides a simple desire for money, Fake Charities can also be used as an front for other activities, or a way to drum up resources for some other plan.

May backfire on the guilty parties, or not. Larger versions are likely to either be filled with Unwitting Pawns, or a bunch of cynics who are in on the con along with a lone believer in the charity. See also Poe's Law. May also include Faking Another Person's Illness. Taking it to the next level may result in a Scam Religion.

This is unfortunately Truth in Television, but there are many guides to recognizing fake charities and scams soliciting donations. Various "watchdog" sites such as Charity Navigator, CharityWatch, and BBB Wise Giving Alliance rate real-life nonprofits on their transparency, accountability, and efficient use of funds.

Contrast with Involuntary Charity Donation, which is when people coerce you into giving to a real charity.

    Comic Books 

-   _Archie at Riverdale High_ #89: In "The Virtuous Villain", Cheryl Blossom, Jason Blossom and the other Pembrooke Academy snobs are looking for a new way to torment the Riverdale townies. The "Master of Machiavellian Merriment," Sidney Snavely, suggests that they trap Archie, Betty and Veronica into giving money to a fake charity to "Save the Hermit Hugabear." They don't realize that Sidney always has his own hidden agenda. Deciding that he is getting neither profit nor credit out of this scheme, Sidney waits till the collection is in full swing and then 'exposes' the scam; resulting in him being hailed as a local hero, and the perpetrators spending a night in jail.
-   In the comic: _Future Five_, as featured on _Atop the Fourth Wall_, Dr. Know uses a charity fund for homeless kittens as a front for his illegal activities.

    Comic Strips 

-   "The Fund for Widows and Orphans" from _Piranha Club_ is more or less used as an expense account by The Club, and more commonly, by the crooked treasurer Sid, whenever there's any money in it.

    Fan Works 

-   Very common in Miraculous Ladybug fics with Lila Rossi:
    -   _BURN THE WITCH_ kicks off with Lila starting one of these, roping poor Rose Lavillant into helping her with it. When Rose finds out that the money she raised ended up going towards Lila's wardrobe, she is _incredibly_ distraught, and Hawk Moth turns her into Witch Hunter, who's out to (appropriately enough) Burn the Witch with a Capital "B".
    -   _A Christmas Liar_ by quicksilversquared has Lila attempting to set up one of those during the Christmas season (coincidentally, right after learning about the school's _legitimate_ charity drive). Marinette knows better than to try directly calling her out, instead leveraging school rules to keep Lila from supplanting the real charity, encouraging people to use watchdog sites that will identify Lila's charity as an obvious fake, and convincing her classmates to keep careful track of how much money they collect and from whom so it can be recovered later.
    -   _The Karma of Lies_ features this as one of Lila's favorite cons. The story opens with her having convinced her classmates to donate a bunch of clothes which will supposedly go to impoverished families, only for her to secretly add the donations she likes most to her own wardrobe and dump the rest into a secondhand store outside of Paris.
        -   Mylene gets hit especially hard by being her Unwitting Pawn, as she spent a lot of time coordinating with all of her contacts and convincing them to support Lila's various causes. Once they learned they were all fake, they assumed Mylene was in on the scheme from the start and blacklist her, much to her dismay.
    -   One of Lila's schemes in _you turned out to be the best thing i never had_ is a fake clothing drive. Allegedly, the clothes donated will be used to help save an endangered species (a direct reference to the below-mentioned _Regarding the Sink_ example), but Rose and Juleka spot her wearing a donated blouse the next week.
-   The _Ace Attorney_ fic _Turnabout Santa Claus_ starts with the arrest of Kris Kringle for emptying a charity's bank account because they weren't really using the money to buy toys for children. By the second day of the trial, Phoenix has proven that Kringle is right; half of the organizations the charity claims to help have never heard of them, and the other half don't even exist; the charity's founders are just keeping all the donated money for themselves.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Jack of the Red Hearts_, Jack and Coke panhandle with a fake Red Cross Bucket.
-   In _The Lemon Drop Kid_, Bob Hope (as the Kid) gets every small-time hood on Broadway to help collect money for "The Nellie Thursday Home for Old Dolls." It's really to pay off his debt to a mobster.

    Literature

-   _The Hardy Boys_: The _Undercover Brothers_ book _Pushed_ features the Haven, a shelter for homeless teenagers that raises millions of dollars in donations to get the kids into college. Most of that goes into the pockets of the director of Haven, and two kids who threaten her racket end up dead.
-   _Jaine Austen Mysteries_: The Tiny Tim Project, from "Nightmare on Elf Street". In theory, it is a toy drive for underprivileged kids. In reality, Barnaby just pockets the cash from his sponsors and sells off the toys online. Scotty found this out, and that's why Barnaby did him in.
-   _The Lincoln Lawyer_: One of the lawyer's clients used a fake charity to trick people out of their money. The donations went to the defended cause but the organization used the donor's numbers to steal even more money.
-   Cribbins in _Making Money_ poses as a devout Omnian collecting "for the kiddies".
-   _Regarding the Sink_ has the "Beans Lift America's Spirit Tremendously!"/BLAST! drive. The aim is allegedly to give the people of China a proper source of protein so they'll stop feasting on an Endangered Species, but the species doesn't exist and the donated beans are actually getting fed to cows in a sweatshop to fuel the villains' plans.
-   In _Thunderball_ the global terrorist organisation SPECTRE hides behind the front of a charitable organisation for the support of victims of World War II; its public head office is situated at 136, boulevard Haussmann in Paris.

    -   Maeby had a fundraiser for her alter ego Shirley, who was said to be suffering from BS.
-   Brian Arthur Derek Boyes in _BAD Boyes_ is a rare example of a Lovable Rogue who goes out with a fake collecting tin (generally Lovable Rogues disdain this, because you're preying on generosity rather than greed). He stays Lovable because he's only doing it because he's desperate; he needs to raise cash for the school bully or he'll be beaten up. As with Lucy and Ethel, his money then gets taken by the _real_ charity he's using the name of. There's also some Hypocritical Humor in the novelisation; when his first attempt nets buttons and foreign money, he's outraged at the dishonesty of some people.
-   Season 9 of _The Beverly Hillbillies_ started with a three-parter where Jed and clan repeatedly falling for a scam artist who had various bogus charities, all of which needed a million dollars and whose initialisms were C.A.S.H.
-   _Boston Legal_: Some friends of Denny Crane pulled a prank on him by tricking them into thinking the Republican Party wanted him as their presidential candidate. During the ceremony to announce him, they told him it was just a prank.

As the pranksters tried to explain the situation, Denny explained he figured out they were pranking him and brought the "agents" as a payback.

The man wins the case but when Rex stops by the foundation, he finds it's being shut down. He realizes the guy set this all up to keep money from his wife. Rex relates that if he reports the fraud, the guy goes to jail. The only way to prevent it is to let the Foundation become a legit charity and continue the daily food flights...which will leave the guy bankrupt in a year.
-   _I Love Lucy_: Lucy and Ethel run a raffle to raise money for "Women Overseas Aid," a charity they make up on the spot on the basis of, "We're women, we want to go overseas, and boy do we need aid." Eventually they figure out that doing such a thing is illegal, but just as they collect all the money, a representative from the real Women Overseas Aid organization shows up to collect their generous donation.
-   _Impractical Jokers_ has done this as a challenge several times. The Jokers have to persuade people to give money to a made-up charity with an obviously ridiculous name, including "Handjobs Across America," "Get That Kid Out Of That Well," "Kolonics for Kids", and "Surprise Funeral." In one instance, the fake charity was called... wait for it..."Fake Charity". To everyone's astonishment, _it got a donation!_
-   In an episode of _Malcolm in the Middle_, Dewey's attempts to sell cookie for his boyscout troop fell flat until he started telling people they were going to support the children of drug-addicted single mothers, even bringing Jamie along as an example of one of the babies they were 'helping'.

-   On _My Name Is Earl_, Earl and Joy ran one of these when they were still married, after seeing a commercial for an organization helping poor children in Africa. They only managed to get one "donor." After a time, Earl had given up on it...but Joy kept it up, even long after she had divorced Earl and married Darnell. She sent the "donor" pictures of a boy named "Mbungo," that were really just pictures of Earl Jr. and a fly. Two of her friends from the trailer park got in on the scam, too. In order to make up for it, Earl tricks the "donor" into getting out of town for a week, plants a fake will, and gets back from Joy and her neighbors the amount he'd donated over the years. But this causes disasters to happen in Pimmit Hills Trailer Park for real, and the old man donates money to help the families get back on their feet, even though they screwed him out of money. The old man explained to Earl that he wasn't upset that his money was being stolen, but that he wasn't actually helping people and this was his chance to do it for real.
-   _Our Miss Brooks_: In the episode "Bobbsey Twins in Stir", a conman is tricking people into selling fake tickets to the policemen's ball. The proceeds are supposedly going to "widows and orphans".

-   _Seinfeld_:

Then he gets equally miffed that he has to get Christmas gifts for all his coworkers. He solves the problem by giving all of _them_ donation cards for a charity he made up called the "Human Fund". His Pointy-Haired Boss Mr. Kruger, himself tasked with finding a charity to give some money, hands George a $20,000 check made out to the Human Fund. George considers actually cashing it, but not to keep the money for himself — he's actually thinking about starting the charity for real. Then Kruger finds out the Human Fund doesn't exist, and he's pissed (not because of the money, but because George gave him a fake Christmas gift). George has to pretend he didn't want to admit that instead of Christmas, he celebrates "Festivus", the holiday his dad made up. And that's how he took his boss to the bizarre Festivus party.
        
        **Jerry:** _(skeptically reading the donation card)_ The Human Fund... "Money for people."
        
    -   In "The Truth", Jerry is audited by the IRS for donating to a bogus charity. And the only reason he donated was that this was back when he was dating Elaine and he was trying to impress her. In his defense, he didn't _know_ it was a fake charity; Kramer had convinced him to give to the "Krakatoa Relief Fund", which Jerry assumed was collecting money for victims of a volcanic eruption but turned out to be collecting for the volcano _itself_.
        
        **Elaine:** Now you're being audited because of it. See? That's karma.  
        **Jerry:** No, that's _Kramer_.

In a Black Comedy bit, when the team busts them, D.D. yanks the "girl" out of the wheelchair and tells her off for using people who trusted her. She lets her go...only to discover that while the woman was lying about her age, she really did need the wheelchair.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_: It's strongly implied that the "Bajoran War Orphans Fund", mentioned by Quark on a number of occasions, is actually just another one of his slush funds.

-   Something like this was mentioned in the backstory of _Portal_. As Cave Johnson's sanity started to degenerate, he worked on some rather absurd and morally questionable projects, one of which was the "Take-a-Wish" foundation, which was supposed to be a charity that would give the wishes of dying children to unrelated, entirely healthy adults.

Unfortunately, a rather shifty-looking group of charity collectors happen to be on the same turf and Ichiban is told they're likely to be scammers, which is confirmed to be true when Ichiban overhears two of them talking about Megumi receiving more donations than them and how they were using the money for their own selfish reasons. Ichiban steps in when he hears them threatening to hurt Megumi and teaches them a lesson, after which they promise to leave her alone and genuinely thought she was pulling a con as well. Later on, Ichiban goes to check on Megumi and the fake collectors come by to donate a small portion of their earnings.
