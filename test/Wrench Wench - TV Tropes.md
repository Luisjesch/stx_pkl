_"I just said that you're pretty. Even when you're covered in... engine grease, you're... No, especially, **especially** when you're covered in engine grease."_

— **Simon Tam** to **Kaylee**, _Firefly_

Mechanical inclinations have traditionally been the forte of men, but the Wrench Wench is a girl who proves the former idea is definitely wrong. She will always be skilled and confident about her own work, as well as Curious as a Monkey in the presence of new and interesting machines — or Constantly Curious, if inspection is impossible. She is usually self-confident enough to not need a Beautiful All Along plot, but will probably have at least one She Cleans Up Nicely moment, even though she is often an Unkempt Beauty anyway.

Often a Ms. Fix It and The Blacksmith, a Wrench Wench might have Machine Empathy and can diagnose problems just by listening to the motor. Her tools extend to pure electronic devices, but she is also likely to be found with a blowtorch and ratchet set. When her talents go beyond mere fixing things to outright creating machinery, she is a Gadgeteer Genius. If it is computers and the Internet instead of mechanics, she is a Hackette.

Contrast to Science Hero's Babe Assistant, who is much less technically competent. The Hood Ornament Hottie is a related trope, where the woman may be dressed or posed as if she was the mechanic, but actually is simply intended to be Eye Candy. However, a genuine Wrench Wench is equal to The Engineer. In settings where she works for scientific departments, she will be a Science Hero.

-   An ad for Kohler plumbing products features a man spotting a rather attractive lady plumber down the street. He quickly runs into his house and starts flushing random household objects down his toilet, trying to get it to clog, before realizing he has a clog-resistant Kohler toilet. Then his wife catches him pouring dry dog food into the toilet and asks him what he's doing.
-   A two-minute video ad for the mobile application "Xero Touch" stars a charming mid-thirties-looking wrench wench, who monologues to the viewer as she goes about her workday, explaining how much the app helps her keep track of what she earns and spends, as her charts materialize on-screen...while, of course, being gritty and cute.

She does have a bad track record when it comes to her inventions interrupting other people, though, making the other weather factory employees afraid of what her mechanical wings might mess up until Hope increases their accuracy by having them programmed to autopilot their way to people's houses to make deliveries.

    Comic Books 

-   Betty Cooper, from _Archie Comics_, is absurdly talented with auto repair and other forms of masculine expertise.

-   In _Drowntown_, Izzy seems to do maintenance on the water bikes used in the courier business she shares with Gina (and Gina might as well). That doesn't mean she actually _likes_ working on machines, though — unlike Gina, she'd get out of the business if there were something with more money and glamour available.

    Fan Works 

-   Both Daisy and Rosalina are presented as having mechanic skills in _The 3 Little Princesses_. With Rosalina it is certainly justified because she has no one else to help with the observatory. When Peach and Rosalina meet the latter isn't even wearing her typical dress, instead she's wearing a dirty mechanic uniform while fixing her observatory.
-   Cowlick from the _Blooming Moon Chronicles_ is one, with her extensive labs in which she usually creates weapons for the protagonists. This also applies to her apprentice, Apple Bloom.

-   _The Naked Jedi_: Sarza, the titular naked Jedi, singlehandedly repairs her parents' ruined shuttlecraft, constructs her own lightsaber, and assembles Essex over the course of the first story. Her Artisan specialization gives her the "Mental Tools" talent, which ignores any penalties for not having the proper tools for a given Mechanics check, and she has the Manipulate Force Power and the upgrade that allows her to add Force Dice up to her Force Rating to Mechanics checks, spending Force Points on Sucess or Advantage.
-   Olga Romanoff, an Air Policewoman in Ankh-Morpork, is also a largely self-taught broomstick technomancer who stands apart from other witches in that she knows what makes one go and is prepared to roll up her sleeves and _really_ work on souping up the standard model. She and her friend and fellow flight technomancer Irena Politek operate a hangar full of customised broomsticks in City Watch service. Working with Dwarf brothers the Messers Schmidt and Zlobenian dwarf Mig Oyeff, they currently fly ME-109's and the MIG-21 broomsticks. Their prototype ME Schmidt 262 is going to be _revolutionary_. The girls appear in _The Price of Flight_ and other tales in the _Discworld_ Expanded Universe.

Given a defective crossbow to examine by her Assassin mother <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Ruth glances at it, identifies the fault in seconds, and then suggests a fix that will put it right _properly_. Given the idea by her older sister, she then designs the Discworld's first acoustic bass guitar, from first principles. she then works out how to use Magitek to add amplification.
-   Sofia from _The Glaceon and the Shadow_ carries a lot of tools with her and uses them to create all kinds of contraptions.

Others, like her flying machine, work very well.
-   In _The SuperStarr Chronicles_, Lila Cheney is shown to be this when she and Toad work together to repair the crashed spaceship that brought her and her friends to Earth.
-   Tsuuma<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is this in _Tengen Toppa Gurren Solvernia_, Viral's personal mechanic and personal snarker.
-   From the Triptych Continuum, we have Ratchette. She runs Ponyville's fixit shop, doing minor to moderate repairs on devices and conveniences — which is all she's generally capable of: adjustments on the physical elements can be managed, but fixing the spells themselves is impossible for a _pegasus_. Her mark seems to give her the (occasional) ability to diagnose problems on contact — something she can't bring herself to tell anypony about — and she does clean up rather nicely, although one angry non-customer describes her as needing five baths just to reach "dirty". Her capabilities and limitations are given some exploration in Mechanical Aptitude.
-   Two cases in the _Kim Possible_ fic _Vacation from the Norm_;
    -   Bonnie Rockwaller. After she married Senor Senor Jr. her new father-in-law Senor Senor Sr. indulged her interest in restoring cars and motorcycles, which contributed to Bonnie's Taking a Level in Kindness, as well as the Senors' Heel–Face Turn. When SSS, SSJ and Bonnie formed a new team of heroes called The Upperclassmen, Bonnie took on the codename "The Mechanic".

    Films — Animated 

-   Audrey from _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_ is chief mechanic of a huge submarine despite being a teenager, and loves machinery in general. Although she's never actually seen repairing anything mechanical _on-screen_ (the most technical work she is shown doing is turning a valve and tightening a nut, tasks anyone with with a pair of functioning hands and a wrench can accomplish, and the one time her set of skills is directly needed, Milo ends up doing the job instead).
-   _The Brave Little Toaster_: Rob's girlfriend Chris apparently is a car mechanic, or at least knows how to work on them. She spends the time at the junkyard looking for rare auto parts.
-   As bizarre as it may sound, Disney seems to be taking Tinker Bell, of all characters, in this direction with her CGI _Disney Fairies_ movies. The reasoning is actually fairly logical—why else would she be named _Tinker_ Bell? Plus, the novel _Peter Pan_ is based on states that Tinker Bell is a tinker who mends the pots and pans. It's not like Disney pulled this out of nowhere.
-   _Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius_: Jimmy Neutron's mother is seen working under the family car at one point. She also pointed out a flaw in one of Jimmy's inventions and explains it in full Techno Babble. It turns out she was very right.

-   Elinor M Brent-Dyer's _Chalet School_ series has Jacynth 'Jack' Lambert, a tomboy who loves carpentry and all things mechanical, and wants to own her own garage. Bear in mind that the books where Jack appears were written during the '50s, when mechanic work was a _very_ unusual career for a woman. This actually becomes a plot point in _Jane and the Chalet School_ when she and Jane Carew get into a fight, because Jack is jealous that Jane gets to wash the teachers' car instead of her.
-   Linh Cinder, the main character of Marissa Meyer's _The Lunar Chronicles_, is the best mechanic in New Beijing.
-   Several Techpriests from the _Ciaphas Cain_ stories qualify. Felecia Tayber (_Death or Glory_) and Mazarin (_Caves of Ice_) are both Techpriests who primarily serve as Enginseers, repairing various pieces of equipment. Kildhar (_The Greater Good_) is more focused on the biological and administrative sides of things, although since she is a Techpriest is can be assumed that she does know her way around a wrench.
-   _The Cinder Spires_: Gwen, much to everyone's surprise, since no-one expects a five-foot, doll-faced daughter of high nobility to know her way around airship power cores. It becomes more clear when she explains that her family _manufactures_ said power cores, and that she has spent enough time on the floor that she can recognize not only make and model but _individual units_ at a glance.

-   _The Heroes of Olympus_:
    -   Leo's mom, Esperanza Valdez, was a mechanic and fell in love with the god of forges, Hephaestus. She received a college degree in mechanical engineering but never received a job in that field because because she was never taken seriously as a mechanic since she was a woman.
    -   Nyssa was a daughter of Hephaestus. She was leader of the cabin of Hephaestus' children. As a child of this god, she could manipulate machines, as well as being an expert mechanic and builder. She could also sense machines, mechanic or metal and identify machinery types by a touch.
-   David Weber's _Honor Harrington_ has a couple of one-step-removed examples. Havenite Admiral Shannon Foraker heads the R&D group which has been so successful at making up the huge technology gap between Haven and Manticore, which existed primarily because of Admiral Sonja Hemphill. Details are not available in either case as to how much they specifically got their own hands dirty, but both women are frequently stated to be the primary drivers of the weapons which put both of their nations significantly in advance of every other group in the galaxy. And as of _Uncompromising Honor_, they are working directly together — and more or less became instant best friends at first sight. The Mesan Alignment better watch out, as right now the only advantage they have is in bio-chem (the genetics based programming attacks) and the streak drive, and Shannon and Sonja are fully aware of the capabilities of both of them.
-   Linda Connor, from Swedish SF author Anders Blixt's dieselpunk spy adventure _Iskriget (The Ice War)_, is a trained mechanic with a solid professional reputation in her home town.

-   Tania, Nathaniel Cade's on/off vampiric girlfriend in the _President's Vampire_ series is one of these; apparently she grew up with seven brothers, and thus never subscribed to the philosophy women are useless with anything mechanical. This proves a useful skill in the second novel when she re-configures the Black Site's fire suppression system to spray methane gas, allowing Cade to set off an explosion to destroy the site and its monstrous occupants.

Whatever crazy thing needs to be done like severing the nacelle safeties to do a Crazy Ivan, disabling charges attached to the external hull, or removing the pulse locator, she is up to it.
-   _The Flying Doctors_ had Emma Plimpton, who fixed everything in Cooper's Crossing that wasn't an aeroplane.

-   Tabby, from _MonsterWarriors_. Invents all manner of weaponry, and makes the Monster Mobile go, all with household waste.
-   All the girls on _Mythbusters_. The most famous, Kari Byron, is actually a lighter example than the other two, being an artist by training. Scottie Chapman from the earlier seasons is a much straighter example, being a welder and metal worker. Jessi Combs, who filled in for Kari when she was on maternity leave, is a metal fabricator.
-   Abby Sciuto on _NCIS_ falls into this category, especially when the team is investigating a vehicle-involved crime. Off with the white lab coat, on with the bright red mechanic's coveralls.
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   Ashley Hammond in the _Power Rangers Turbo_ episode "The Turn of the Wretched Wrench".
    -   The series has had several sexy scientists down the years, but it wasn't until _Power Rangers Operation Overdrive_'s Ronny that it got a Wrench Wench to balance things out. Her tendency for practically _fondling_ new weaponry with an awed smile on her face makes one wonder how the show stayed TV-Y7. Of course, she _had_ to be the first to test out any new gadget. And apparently, being a race car driver who can work on her own cars has makes her qualified to work on giant robots. One of the aforementioned scientists was Operation Overdrive's own Pink Ranger, providing the show with a double-dose of geek girls.
    -   Gemma in _Power Rangers RPM_ combines Wrench Wench with Hackette and a fetish for explosions.
-   _Sanctuary_ has Dr. Helen Magnus. Very obvious in episode 21, where they get stuck in an old oil rig and need to MacGyver their way out.

-   Maria from _Sesame Street_ runs the local garage with her husband.
-   When the family starts fixing up a car for Matt in season 3 of _7th Heaven_, it's boy-crazy Lucy who is shown to be an idiot savant when it comes to cars.
-   Given her heritage, Marti in _Slingers_ would be expected to be technically skilled, and so far she's demonstrated a definite affinity with spaceship power systems (and the disabling thereof).
-   _Stargate SG-1_ has Samantha Carter, who's not only the show's Omnidisciplinary Scientist but also builds Naquada reactors in her office/workshop in her spare time. One scene showed her working closely with a mechanical object very intently. With her, it is likely an alien device of some kind. The camera pulls back to reveal she was tuning up her bike.
-   B'Elanna Torres from _Star Trek: Voyager_. Although Star Trek engine rooms tend to be cleaner than a modern-day operating theatre, she does still manage to get covered in dirt and grease on a fairly regular basis.

    She's hip to everything, man, from customs to rails
    
    And axle grease embedded 'neath her fingernails!

With some help from her grandfather and his old war buddies, she even salvaged enough pieces from a scrap yard to assemble a working fighter jet that she took off in. (Unfortunately, she took off just as Erusea launched a drone-fighter surprise attack across Osea, one of which was being chased right by her when she was in the sky... and she had neglected to install an IFF that would identify her to the Osean pilots. She was shot down, but survived- and was thrown in jail for her trouble.)

Among her inventions include phasegate tech, which allows her to teleport around the battlefield; her high tech and fashionable Battle Ballgown, which aids her when fighting; and a cybernetic implant which allows her to telekinetically control four of her five rapiers. She's also a skilled roboticist, having been the brains behind her fellow Battleborn Kid Ultra's original design and purpose.
-   _BattleCry_: has Jin, on the Han Republic team, is a Gadgeteer Genius who grew up assisting her inventor father, and so might fall under this, although at the finer, more delicate end (clocks, etc) of the wrench-wielding spectrum.

She also gives Dante Dr. Faust, a literal magic **hat** that she made based on her father's research that uses red orbs as ammunition.

    -   _Fallout 4_ continues the trend with Proctor Ingram, who maintains the Brotherhood Of Steel's Cool Airship the Prydwen, suits of Powered Armor, and is in charge of repairs of Liberty Prime, all without having any legs.

-   _Galaxy Angel_:
    -   The original trilogy has Creta Biscuit, the chief engineer of the Elsior who's often found at the hangar doing maintenance to the Emblem Frames. Aside from her looks, she also has a rather cheery personality and an event in the first game reveals she's a huge fan of young idols.

    -   Downplayed by Alisa Reinford from _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel_. As the scion of the largest orbal technology manufacturer in Erebonia, she has the technical know-how to troubleshoot malfunctioning orbments and make minor repairs, but she's not quite on the level of being an engineer. Her forte is more on the business side of the company than on the development side.
-   The incarnation of Princess Zelda in _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ is shown to be this through the game's flashback scenes.

    -   As well as Engineer Gabriella Daniels, first introduced in _Mass Effect 2_, who works in the Normandy's lower deck alongside her coworker, Ken Donnelly.
-   Nae Aki in _Medarot Spirits_; she never was anything near fanservicey, but, in another hand, had Ikki slightly fawning over her. Justified by the fact that she's the granddaughter of Dr. Aki, the modern Medarot inventor. Thing is, if you considers the series' existence at all.

Apparently, this was part of her Freelancer training. It tends to be overshadowed by her repeatedly kicking everyones' asses, though.
-   The SCP Foundation has Cassy, the living drawing who wishes she could exist in the 3D world. Her hobby is a car she's building from drawn parts, and when photographed with the camera that shows what the subject wishes to be doing, the result — nearly everyone else's being Nightmare Fuel or Tear Jerker material, or a couple humorous exceptions — has her in the real world... doing exactly the same thing.

    Real Life 

-   In the first half of the 19th century, the only legitimate daughter of Lord Gordon Byron, Ada Lovelace. Her mother directed her education towards maths since she thought the "poetic tendencies" from a typical education of the day were dangerous (which is to say she thought poets were trouble; having married Lord Byron, she was probably right), a course of action with which Lord Byron totally agreed, since young Ada was excellent at maths. As an adult, she became one of the first computer programmers. That's right; even before the first computer, she invented algorithms for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, the "ancestor" of modern computers.
-   Rosie the Riveter from U.S. World War II propaganda. And, obviously, all the female mechanics. Elizabeth Hawes' book about working in an aircraft plant during World War II is titled _Why Women Cry; or Wenches With Wrenches_.

After an all-day journey in which she had to refill the car with petroleum solvent bought from pharmacies, unblocked a fuel line with a hat pin, and used a garter to insulate a wire, she telegraphed her husband from Pforzheim. Rather than getting angry, Karl asked Bertha for her suggestions on improvements, including a lower gear for climbing hills and use of treated leather brake pads to increase stopping power. Her exploits led to greatly increased sales and recognition of Benz's machines.
-   Katherine Johnson (née Coleman), whose calculations of orbital mechanics were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights. During her 35-year career at NASA, she earned a reputation for mastering complex manual calculations and helped pioneer the use of computers to perform the tasks. Since these were early computers, many astronauts like John Gleen didn't fully trust them for their first missions. Gleen insisted that Johnson personally check and sign off on them, as she was the only one whose word he would take. Note this was 1961 in the American South; NASA had only been desegregated 3 years earlier.
-   Grace Hopper was this for software engineers. She found the original software bug (it was literally a dead moth in the circuitry), wrote the first compiler, wrote what may have been the first case of open-source software, and was the main designer behind COBOL.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  She also served 42 years in the United States Navy, is the first woman to be awarded an Admiral's star, and was the only living woman to see a US Navy warship named after her.

-   An all-female auto shop has opened in Mississauga, Ontario.
-   When "Jungle Jim" Lieberman was match racing Funny Cars in the early 1970s, his girlfriend "Jungle Pam" Hardy was a regular sight.

-   Victoria Drummond OBE was the first woman certified as a Marine Engineer in the United Kingdom. Despite being born in an upper-class Scottish family and being named after her godmother, Queen Victoria, she developed an interest in machinery and engineering, taking an apprenticeship at a shipyard.
