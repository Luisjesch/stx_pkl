_"Dealing with trained operatives is like playing chess with a master. Dealing with **criminals**, on the other hand, is like playing checkers with a 3-year-old: they like to change the rules."_

Villains are evil, and making a Deal with the Devil is always a bad idea, but despite this, they still have a tendency to follow through with their deals. Sure, they will twist the terms to screw over their client, but they won't be outright dishonest and refuse to follow through on their end, because Villains Never Lie.

Except when they do.

This Stock Phrase is uttered in response to an expression of shock at a broken promise of leniency or forgiveness. For example, the Big Bad has kidnapped the Love Interest and is holding them Hostage for MacGuffin, and the hero arrives, having over the MacGuffin. This line is then spoken by the villain (or a particularly unmerciful and unscrupulous hero) just before making off with/killing the hostage anyway, blowing up the Doomed Hometown, using the Doomsday Device, or some other act of merciless badness that they specifically said they would not do. Sometimes spoken just after, with a smirk and a smoking gun. This action is commonly done by Neutral Evil characters.

Generally speaking, anyone who says this is lining up that puppy between the goal posts or even about to perform their defining act of depravity and has, in any case, revealed their cruelest colors. Expect them to rub it in with Evil Gloating, asking the heroes "Did you actually believe me when I said..." For some reason, this often seems to take the heroes by surprise, even when the speaker has an extensive history of villainy.

Sometimes used by a former bad guy who's made a Heel–Face Turn - made the offer to rejoin Team Evil, they calmly accept, or perhaps pretend to seriously contemplate the offer, shocking any listening heroes, and about three seconds later proceed to kick ass on the side of good, taking everybody by surprise. The bad guy looks up at them and protests, "You said you're on our side!" The former bad guy says, "Yeah. I lied."

Usually said with dripping irony, which tends to fall a little flat if the speaker doesn't at least put a new spin on the phrase. May be accompanied by a Lying Finger Cross. Compare Empty Promise and Blatant Lies, and contrast Villains Never Lie. Also contrast Exact Words, where the liar actually makes it look like he was telling the truth in a different way to get what (s)he wants anyways. Also see Schmuck Bait, where the liar doesn't even have to talk. Moving the Goalposts is a downplayed and (usually) less evil version.

As well, an antihero may utter this phrase, particularly if they have promised the bad guy, such as an abductor, they won't harm him if he tells them where the victim is hidden. One the anti-hero is confident they know what they need to know, they may say this, and then throw them off a cliff (or otherwise dispatch them).

-   There is a rather lengthy social ad, where an unremarkable young man talks about the importance of driving carefully. He tells (with appropriate visuals) how he learned, how at first he was tempted to break the rules now and then, how he had a few close shaves. With time and experience he became a better driver, later he taught his girlfriend to drive, she had similar temptations early on, but learned to resist them. He tells how they married, had children, and what happy family they have. He ends his story with: "Now that you've seen that, I hope you understand that you too should drive carefully. Oh, and I lied. I didn't pass that truck. And none of the rest happened." And fades away.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Dragon Ball_: In the original _Dragon Ball_ series, when General Blue threatens to shoot a paralyzed Goku unless they tell him where the Dragon Ball is, Bulma gives in and tells him. He then decides to shoot Goku anyway, quoting the trope.
-   _Inuyasha_ has an example with Shiori; her grandfather Taigokumaru, a malevolent bat demon, stated that he would stop attacking her village if she gave herself up to him and powered their Deflector Shield, only to immediately attack said village the following night. He even mocks the villagers for actually believing he would honor a deal with humans.
-   In the _Black Butler_ final episode, we have a Villain Protagonist becoming slightly less villainous sharing this exchange with his Affably Evil demon butler, causing a bit of a Tear Jerker as Sebastian jumps into the Thames to recover Ciel.
    
    **Sebastian:** You said you would live till then.  
    **Ciel:** ...I lied.
    
-   In the second episode of _K_, wandering swordsman Kuroh Yatogami has tracked down Yashiro Isana, the teenager caught on video committing the crime, and is about to kill him, when Shiro asks him for one final request. He wants Kuroh to give a farewell letter to his little sister, who's been in the hospital her whole life and has no one but Shiro, so she'll be completely alone once Kuroh kills him. Her name? Ummm, uhh... Marilyn - no, wait, Mari! Mari Isana! And Kuroh still believes him after that. But when he hands Kuroh the paper, Kuroh opens it to see... a little doodle of Shiro giving a thumbs-up and a wink, with a speech bubble that says, "I lied!". Shiro then sets off a few fireworks he had in his bag and escapes.
-   While it's not the exact phrase, similar things are naturally said countless times in _Liar Game_, both when the villains reveal that they were just manipulating the good guys, and when the good guys pull a fast one over the villains. Commonly said in the form "This is the Liar Game; it's a game where you lie."
-   After the heroes of _Monster Rancher_ give themselves up for a hostage, Pixie goes so far as to say that she _never_ keeps her promises.

-   _Bleach_:
    -   In chapter 414, we found out that the ever Affably Evil Gin Ichimaru lied about his Bankai in his amazingly simple watch-and-wait ploy to kill Big Bad Aizen. Did we mention that he has probably been plotting this for over a CENTURY and broke the Explaining Your Power to the Enemy rule, as well as being in complete violation of the Big Bad's Complexity Addiction?
    -   Aizen spent at least as long telling the rest of the soul society that his Zanpakuto just dazzled opponents with pretty reflections.
    -   At one point, Ichigo points out that one of Aizen's claims directly contradicts something he said before, which means he's lying. Aizen's response is to ask Ichigo why he assumes that Aizen wasn't lying back _then_.
-   Late in _Gundam X_, Garrod threatens to destroy the Space Revolutionary Army's colony laser unless they return the kidnapped Tifa. When they do return her, he blows it up anyway; Garrod is The Hero and there's no way he'd let such a powerful weapon remain in the hands of belligerents who want to destroy the Earth.
-   Rare heroic (and tear-jerking) example in _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_, when in a previous timeline, Madoka and Homura are lying side-by-side, having defeated Walpurgis Night but, due to not having any Grief Seeds left, about to become witches themselves thanks to The Corruption... when Madoka suddenly produces a single Grief Seed with which she cleanses Homura's Soul Gem. Then asks Homura to Mercy Kill her.
    
    **Homura:** You said you didn't have any Grief Seeds left!  
    **Madoka:** I lied.
    
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Riza Hawkeye says this to Envy as she shoots him — after she rooted him out by claiming that she and Colonel Roy Mustang, the latter of whom Envy disguised himself as, were on a First-Name Basis.
    -   In the last chapter, Greed is about to be absorbed into Father, and wants to cut Ling Yao's soul loose so that Ling, at least, isn't sucked up into it as well. Ling argues that they should fight Father's pull together, and Greed appears to agree, before sucker punching Ling and setting him loose. Ling protests that Greed said he never lies, to which Greed responds: "That was my first, and last, lie. If you're going to be Emperor one day, you have to stop being so gullible."
-   _Pokémon: The First Movie_: Giovanni's response to Mewtwo when the latter confronts the former's early declaration that they were equal partners. Not surprisingly, Mewtwo is royally pissed at the betrayal and decides to blow the joint - figuratively and literally.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   In the Virtual Nightmare Arc, after the Big Five have stolen Tristan's body, they duel Yugi and Joey, wagering it against theirs. After the heroes are victorious and Yugi demands they return it, Lector (who's directing it at the moment) tells them, "You must have mistaken me for someone who keeps his word." (All five of them try to attack the heroes physically then, but Noah stops them.)
    -   In the dub of _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_, Leo convinces Luna, Tanner, and Yanagi to seek help from Akiza and the Arcadia Movement. Sayer, the movement's leader, invites them in under the pretense of helping them face the Dark Signer threat. In reality, he only wanted to see if Leo had any potential as a Psychic Duelist like he believed her sister did. When Leo wakes up, leg chained to the ground in preparation for a psychic duel test, he questions why Sayer isn't going about what he promised to do. Sayer's response?
-   The catchphrase of the main character of _Itsuwaribito_, it's basically the whole point of the manga.
-   Played for laughs in one of the Beach Episodes of _Azumanga Daioh_. Tomo changes into her bathing suit to hit the beach as soon the gang arrives at the beach house despite having suggested the trip so they could study for exams.

What makes it especially funny is the long Beat that suggests she was actually trying to think of an excuse, but couldn't.
-   Near the end of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Reflection_, Iris reveals to Kyrie that the Examia doesn't have the power to save Eltria or her father, and she was merely using her in her revenge against Yuri.
-   _One Piece_: 25 years ago, Kaido and Orochi made a deal with Oden that if he danced naked in the streets once a week for five years, they would not kidnap and sell the citizens of Wano into slavery and would leave once the five years were up. Only, they never intended to fulfill this promise, something made clear once the five years were up. As Kaido explained, they didn't have the manpower to take on Oden and his followers head-on at the time, so they tricked Oden into a deal that would allow them to accumulate their forces before attacking him. Oden being made to degrade himself and drag his name through the mud was an added bonus.
-   In _Yuri is My Job!_, Hime, being a frequent liar, does this sometimes.
    -   Shortly after meeting Mitsuki, Hime asks to play on the piano, and does so surprisingly well. Mitsuki remarks that Hime told her classmates that she couldn't play. Hime replies with "Oh! so you were listening. That was a lie," before explaining that she kept it secret so that her classmates wouldn't try to have Hime replace Mitsuki for the piano accompaniment.
    -   Some time later, Hime offers to hang out with her classmates, but instead ditches them to spend time with Mitsuki. While in the room with Mitsuki, Hime then calls her classmates to let them know that has to look after the house, then tells Mitsuki that she lied to her classmates earlier.
-   _The Mysterious Cities of Gold_:

-   _School Zone Girls_: Kei and Yokoe, best friends, are watching TV when an ad for a horror movie comes on. Kei, despite her boyish looks, is deathly afraid of horror stories. She covers her eyes and loudly recites all 47 prefectures of Japan to avoid looking at or hearing the TV. Yokoe soothingly reassures her that the commercial is over. It isn't. As Kei yells with fright at a stringy-haired ghost girl, an overly pleased-with-herself Yokoe clenches her fist triumphantly and declares "I lied."

-   _Iron Man_:
    -   A variation: when Doctor Octopus, who's been holding the city hostage with a supposed bomb, uses it with a subversion of Exact Words when telling Tony it's not really a bomb at all.

Spidey intervened, but it looked like Scorpion would get away with his hostage, until he found out Lance Bannon was taking some great photos of the fight, meaning the fight was helping J. Jonah Jameson (a guy the Scorpion _absolutely hated_). He changed his mind and said he would _kill_ Musgrave unless Jameson surrendered to him in an hour. Jameson refused to cooperate (mostly because he had been kidnapped and replaced by the Chameleon during this time) but when the hour was up, the Scorpion changed his mind again, and bolted, taking Debevick with him, leading to this:

    -   A small variation
    -   Buck subverts this by giving Der Rock the Destroyer back the MacGuffin that he supposedly just gave back to the PSmiths shortly thereafter.
    
    **PSmith:** Just a minute, if that's the device, then we still have to return it to he-who-must-be-watered.  
    **Buck:** Relax, PSmith. I'm lying. It's a fake.  
    **Der Rock the Destroyer:** IT'S WHAT?!!

    **Luna/Nightmare Moon:** Celestia! You said we would fix this, make things right again!  
    **Celestia:** I’m afraid I lied to you, sister. It's what those of us that are willing to do whatever it takes to protect this kingdom do sometimes.

"... I was lying about lying."

    **Penelope:** That dirty bastard...  
    **Rule-of-Three:** There are three rules to dealing with demons, like me... One, always get payment in advance. Two, always watch your back. And the third rule is... _\[transformation is now complete\]_ _Well, the third rule is, just don't make deals with them at all! They tend to lie!_

-   In _Demon Knight_, the Collector says this directly to one character just before he is Rewarded as a Traitor Deserves.
-   Damodar says the exact line in the _Dungeons & Dragons (2000)_ movie. Most of the audience saw it coming from around the opening credits.
-   In _Exam_, White says this when everyone calls him out on his back-stabbing.
-   In the film _Freejack_, Mick Jagger gets the very last line in the film, when asked by Emilio Estevez about his sudden change of loyalties. It is delivered with such scenery chewing glee that it may be the Platonic Ideal of I Lied.
-   Played for Laughs in the original _Fright Night_:
    
    **Charley Brewster:** C'mon, you just said you believe in vampires!  
    **Peter Vincent:** I _\[slams down car hood\]_ _**lied!**_  
    **Vacendak:** I LIED!
    
-   _Gone (2012)_: Jill says this after she starts pouring gasoline onto her abductor, who screams that she said she'd let him go if he'd told her what he's done with her sister.
-   In _The Heat_ after Ashburn takes one out of Mullins' book and shoots a drug lord in the crotch, Mullins reveals that she never had any bullets in the gun during her groin Russian Roulette on a perp earlier.
-   _Heathers_: J.D. tells Veronica that using "ich luge" bullets will only pierce the skin of the jocks, not kill them. "Ich lüge" is German for "I'm lying."
-   In _ManOnFire_, a burned-out intelligence operative becomes a bodyguard to a wealthy executive's little girl. After she is kidnapped for ransom, he interrogates one of the girl's captors, promising that they will not be harmed. When the kidnapper reveals what they know, the bodyguard informs the other kidnappers that the promise was not true, and executes one kidnapper. This greatly enhances the cooperativeness of the remaining kidnapper.
-   In _Interstellar_, when Murphy asks the dying Professor about his gravitational theory midway through the film, he confesses that he faked them to keep everybody from worrying about the future. "I lied. I lied, Cooper."
-   _Lock Up_: Warden Drumgoole promises one of Frank's friends a reduced sentence if he'll betray him at the right moment. When he does, he declares that they "don't make deals with prisoners", and has him thrown back into genpop.
-   Gollum/Sméagol does this in the film version of _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_. The variation here is the Split Personality. Frodo always knew that "Gollum" couldn't be trusted, but he thought that "Sméagol" would keep his word to obey him.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  When Sméagol turns on Frodo near the end, they have this exchange:
    
    **Frodo:** But you swore! You swore on the precious! Sméagol promised!  
    **Gollum:** Sméagol lied.
    
-   _The Mask_: "You said you wouldn't hurt him!" followed by the obligatory smug "I lied".
-   In _Masters of the Universe_, Skeletor _won_. He got He-Man to surrender, give up his sword, let himself be tortured, because he left He-Man's friends back on Earth. Said friends found their way back to Eternia and attacked Skeletor's forces, and when they attacked back He-Man shouts that Skeletor promised not to hurt them. The weird thing here is that technically, Skeletor _did_ honor his part and his forces are actually _defending themselves_. However, Skeletor is drunk with power at this point so fulfilled this trope just to fulfill it. (He's evil). Which galvanizes He-Man to kill him. Whups!
-   While not outright said, an example does happen in _The Mummy (1999)_, the heroes get cornered by a mob of Imhotep's followers. Imhotep offers (through Beni translating for him) that if Evey comes with him (to be sacrificed), he will spare her friends. They accept the offer, believing that Rick, Johnathan and Ardeth Bay, will live to fight the day after so that they can rescue her later. Unfortunately, once she's in hand, Imhotep orders in ancient Egyptian to his followers to kill the rest of them.
-   In _My Blue Heaven_, in order to elicit sympathy, Vinny tells Barney that he saved his life since despite working for organized crime, he didn't know how to use a gun. At the climax, he singlehandedly stops two hitmen with a proficient display of marksmanship. When Barney calls him on it, Vinny states that he lied, which is the only time where he actually admits to one of his lies flat out.
-   In _Next of Kin (1982)_, Linda overhears both Connie and Dr. Barton confess that they had both lied to her about the nature of the suspicious deaths at the retirement home, both past and present.
-   _The Prestige_: When Angier's wife drowns during an escape act gone wrong, Cutter tells him about a sailor he knew once who almost drowned; he said "it was like going home". When he discovers that Angier has been drowning his duplicates created by Tesla's transporter machine, he reveals that he only told Angier that to comfort him: "I lied - he said it was agony!"
-   A rare heroic example occurs at the end of _The Ribald Tales of Robin Hood_. After promising Lady Sallyforth that she will live if she lets Marian go, Robin then turns her over to his men to do with as they will. When she protests that he said she would be allowed to go, he responds:
    
    "What is the word of an outlaw worth?"
    
-   A somewhat more meta-example: _Scary Movie_'s tagline was "No Mercy. No Shame. No Sequel." When _Scary Movie 2_ came out, their tagline was: "We lied."
-   In _Sister Act_, on allowing Deloris to stay in the convent:
    
    **Reverend Mother:** That is not a person you can hide. That is a conspicuous person, designed to stick out.  
    **Monsignor O'Hara:** You took a vow of hospitality for all in need.  
    **Reverend Mother:** I lied.
    
-   Invoked by Overdog, played by Michael Ironside in _Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone_ to Nicki (played by a young Molly Ringwald).
    
    **Overdog:** You have a very enviable life force, a life force you're going to share with me.  
    **Nicki:** But... you said if I made it through, I'm free.  
    **Overdog:** _(with a Slasher Smile)_ I lied, _nobody_ goes free!
    
-   Used by the _good guy_ in _Star Trek III: The Search for Spock_. Worth pointing out, in a nerdy way, that from the Klingon perspective, this makes Kirk very much a villain. It's considered a great deal of dishonor for a Klingon to be captured alive rather than killed in battle.
    
    **Kirk:** Help us or die!  
    **Maltz:** I do not deserve to live.  
    **Kirk:** Fine. I'll kill you later.  
    _\[later\]_  
    **Maltz:** Wait. You said you would kill me.  
    **Kirk:** I lied.
    
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   _A New Hope_:
        -   The scene where Leia bluffs about the location of the rebel base and Tarkin immediately orders the destruction of her home planet, telling her she is "far too trusting". On the other hand, Tarkin said he would blow up Alderaan if she did _not_ tell him the base's location. He never said that he would _not_ blow up Alderaan if Leia _did_ tell him the location.
        -   Reversed a few minutes later when Tarkin is absolutely shocked to learn Leia lied about that location. Vader responds with "I told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion, unless she thought she could destroy us in the process." Given what he had done earlier, he should've known that was coming. (Well, there _was_ a Rebel base there. Just not an active one.)
    -   _The Empire Strikes Back_:
        
        -   Lando Calrissian of Cloud City makes a deal with Darth Vader, and it kept getting worse all the time. It worked out in the end, and the Expanded Universe makes it clear that if he had refused, Cloud City would have been attacked and destroyed. There are two exchanges that reflect this trope, though neither actually say "I lied."
        
        **Lando:** That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!  
        **Vader:** Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly?  
        **Lando:** ...No.  
        **Vader:** Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.
        
        -   ...and
-   In _Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines_, the Arnie Terminator pretends he'll let Katherine Brewster go if she tells him where John Connor is before admitting he lied, showing the epononymous machine has become ridiculously human enough to lie (he's been expanded with psychology routines). Or to reference his old movies.
-   During the Armed Blag at the start of _Transit_, Marek shoots the driver, causing the Inside Man to object:
    
    **Man:** Nobody's supposed to die! You said that nobody's supposed to die.  
    **Marek:** I lied.  
    _\[shoots him\]_
    
-   A lighter version occurs in the comedy _Water_. After Granola Girl Pamela Weintraub states her opposition to Spenco exploiting the island's mineral water, Governor Baxter Thwaites threatens to have her deported as an undesirable alien. Being taken hostage together makes them realise it's all Belligerent Sexual Tension.
    
    **Pamela:** You said I was an undesirable alien.  
    **Baxter:** I lied. _(start smooching)_
    

    Literature 

-   _Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception_: Opal Koboi regarding the explosive strapped to Julius Root supposedly having had a "sweet spot", which, if Holly had hit it accurately, would have saved Root's life. There was no sweet spot, and the bomb went off seconds later. This served the dual purpose of screwing with Holly by forcing her to shoot her oldest friend _and_ tricking her into framing herself for his murder on camera.
-   _A Brother's Price_: Jerin pulls this on the villains, justifying it by pointing out that if he were more honest than them, he would be at a disadvantage, and he prefers to "meet people at their level".
-   _Companions of the Night_: Ethan does it so much that Kerry has a really hard time to spot when he’s actually telling the truth. He indeed has had a lot of time to practice his lying skills, being a vampire and all...
-   _Deverry_: A rare completely heroic example occurs late in the cycle. Nevyn, in pursuit of the Big Bad, makes a deal with a pack of Elite Mooks, who make a big play of how they always keep their word, no matter what. Having bargained with them to get his hands on an artefact linked to the Big Bad, he then catches a Brick thrown _four books earlier_, (he's one of the few Light Sorcerers who **didn't** swear an oath always to tell the truth) and so he can set them all on fire.
-   _Discworld_: An Elf attempts this on Magrat in _Lords and Ladies_. However, she was one step ahead and A) was wearing armor under her wedding dress and B) tricked one of them into opening a box containing Greebo.
-   _Don Quixote_: While wandering, Don Quixote finds a man named Juan Haduldo flogging his servant, the shepard boy Andrés. Quixote stops him and orders him to promise to never do that again and to pay the boy a fair wage. As soon as Quixote leaves, Haduldo angrily says he has no obligation to obey a promise made to some old coot and resumes flogging the boy and not paying him. When Andrés meets Quixote again, he calls him out on not keeping tabs on them or even contacting the authorities to enforce the promise. Quixote had assumed that all men would never break a promise.
-   _Dragonriders of Pern_: In _Weyr Search_, the first novella, Lessa, the heiress to Ruatha Hold, schemes against evil Lord Fax who took the place by force when she was a child. Over the years she psychically maneuvers Ruatha to ruins, leading him to vow he'll renounce it in favor of his son, if any. Seeing Fax's wife Gemma die before giving birth, she announces a living son, leading dragonrider F'lar to kill Fax in a gruesome knife fight. When she reveals herself as the true heir, F'lar reminds her that Fax's son is now the heir. She says scornfully "Gemma died, the babe unborn. I lied!" (But she didn't. After she left Gemma dead, the midwife did a C-section and brought out a healthy boy.)
-   _The Executioner_: In "Hollywood Hell", Mack Bolan does this trope to a Mafia thug in the pornography business, whom he promised to release if he talked. Which counts as Took a Level in Jerkass as Bolan has _always_ kept his word in the past when he promised to let someone go unharmed, and in fact has a reputation among his enemies for doing so.
-   _Fate/Zero_: Lord Kayneth is given a geas, in which it states that he and his wife shall not be harmed by Kiritsugu in any way should he accept the conditions, which is to have his Servant commit suicide. Lord Kayneth, who was dealt a grievous wound in a former battle, accepts. After the death of his Servant, Lord Kayneth and his wife are shot dead by Maiya, a henchman of Kiritsugu, who is not covered by his geas.

-   _The Gatekeepers: Evil Star_:
    
    **Fabien:** Salamanda promised me the boy wouldn't be hurt.  
    **Rodriguez:** Salamanda lied! (Shoots Fabien)
    
-   In _Inkheart_, the Big Bad Capricorn lies — a lot — in order to get people to do what he wants, and such gets one of these in about every scene he's in, in addition to being honestly baffled that people are surprised. At one point, he _lies about having lied_.
-   _Legacy of the Dragokin_: Kthonia promises to cease her rampage and leave everyone alone in exchange for mercy. Everyone is surprised when she backs out of the promise moments later and continues fighting.
-   _Old Kingdom_: Word for word in _Abhorsen_.
    
    **Lirael:** You told me you weren't one of the Seven!  
    **Disreputable Dog:** I lied. It's one of the reasons I'm the _Disreputable_ Dog.
    
-   _Sisterhood Series_ by Fern Michaels: Believe it or not, the heroes (anti-heroes may be a better term) use this a number of times on the villains! The Vigilantes used this on the bad guys in _Final Justice_. Jack Emery, and Harry Wong at least pull this on a pedophile polygamist sheriff and his two deputies in _Under The Radar_. Jack made an offer that the first one who told them what they needed to know would be set free. Deputy Clyde took the offer and told them everything he knew. When he was done, he said that he told them everything he knew and now they have to keep their word. Jack does not release him, and states that he will be set free, but Jack didn't say where! Clearly, the intention is to put them in prison where they belong! Deputy Clyde was unhappy, and he mouthed off some racist remarks at Harry Wong, resulting in him being knocked out.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   An inversion happens in _A Game of Thrones_, when Littlefinger betrays Ned Stark. Littefinger had directly told Ned not to trust him and reminds Ned of it while betraying him.
    -   In the epilogue of _A Storm of Swords_, Merrett Frey goes to ransom Petyr, a relative of his, from the Brotherhood Without Banners... then he sees that the Brotherhood already hanged him.
        
        **Merrett:** You said if you had the gold by sunset he wouldn't be harmed...  
        **Tom Sevenstrings:** Well, you've got us there, my lord. That was a lie of sorts, as it happens.
        
-   _Star Wars Legends_:
    -   _The Thrawn Trilogy_: In _Dark Force Rising_, Grand Admiral Thrawn speaks to ex-Imperial-agent Mara Jade about the location of the long-lost Katana fleet; she doesn't know it, but her current boss does. Thrawn tells her that she has a few days to go get the coordinates and lets her get back to her ship and rendezvous with her boss, but he plants a tracking device on her, shows up just after she does, and captures him. Mara is furious; Thrawn is coldly practical, and calmly states that he changed his mind on their deal. This ultimately works very much against Thrawn, as it this incident is what turns Mara against the Empire for good, making this one of the few times he succumbs to the Villain Ball.
    -   _Galaxy of Fear_: _Planet Plague_ has the villain give Tash an injection of The Virus while in the guise of a doctor. Later, as she starts to succumb, she says he said it was a vaccine! Well, he lied. A later book has the computer SIM. When everything went wrong, it kept telling Zak to get to its main computer room and input some codes to remove its Restraining Bolt, and that it could help him then. Zak kept not doing it, and his sister ended up locked in a room with the air being slowly vented out. SIM told Zak it would only be able to open that door when he input those codes. Guess what happened when he did.
    -   _New Jedi Order_: Vergere. "When will you learn that everything I tell you is a lie?" She's more of a Trickster Mentor than anything else (at least, until _Legacy of the Force_ retconned her into a Sith.)
-   _Sword Art Online_: Quinella motivates her henchman Chudelkin by swearing an oath to the goddess Stacia that if he can defeat the heroes, she will have sex with him. She has no intention of honoring her oath and points out that she doesn't believe in Stacia, so her oath is meaningless.
-   In the Ray Bradbury short story "The Toynbee Convector", Craig Bennett Stiles, a Bill Gates Expy, announced on live television that he built a time machine and travelled into the future, and revealed that in the future mankind would abolish war, disease, prejudice and famine and create a true utopia. Nearly a century later, in the utopia that Stiles envisioned, Stiles admitted to a reporter interviewing him, "I lied," that he never really travelled into the future. He used a special effects team to create fake "artifacts from the future" to show the world, hoping to give humanity a goal to strive for. His lie became a self-fulfilling prophecy.
-   _Trick or... Trapped!_: At one point, you can end up in a fight with a crazed pirate who wants to kill you for getting too friendly with his pet ghost. He says that he will spare your life if you give him an apple, which is his favorite food. If you do have the apple with you, you can give it to him like he says. It doesn't matter though, because he goes back on his word and kills you anyway. Prick.
-   A rare Heroic version shows up in Stephen King's _It_. During the Ritual of Chud in 1987, Richie seizes IT and is hurting IT with his quips and voices, and tells IT he'll consider letting IT go if IT takes him to his friend, Bill. The self-proclaimed Eater of Worlds and of Children is surprised when Richie pulls an "I Lied".
-   Another heroic version in _Who Censored Roger Rabbit?_ when Eddie gives a Jerkass Genie a lethal saltwater bath after having it grant him a single, albeit selfless, wish for him.
-   _The Wind in the Willows:_ Badger drags Toad "off screen" for a long lecture about breaking his motorcar addiction. As Badger drones on, Rat sardonically comments to Mole that it's pointless, because Toad will _say_ anything, and sure enough, as soon as the duo comes back with Toad having promised to change, Toad announces he was lying and will gleefully go off in the first motorcar he lays eyes on. He gets locked up and kept under guard.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The first scene of _Blade: The Series_ is essentially this trope. Blade has just interrogated a Russian vampire:
    
    **Blade**: You can go.
    
    **Vampire**: You are joking, yes?
    
    **Blade**: Yes.
    
-   Played straight by the _Burn Notice_ episode "No Good Deed". Quoth the villain of the week, Eve, "Remember that part about me letting you live if you helped me rip off my buyer? I lied." (Westen had never actually believed her; he was just buying time for Fiona to put together a rescue.)
-   Another (mostly) heroic version; Brenda Johnson of _The Closer_ often lies to her suspects about all the crimes they're being charged with until after she's gotten their confession, but in a Season 6 episode she actually says the trope title. She tells the perp that his drive-by shooting didn't hurt anyone, but if he confessed to the crime and explained why he tried to have the target killed, the LAPD wouldn't arrest him for the property damage caused by the shooting. He confesses, she reveals that three US Army soldiers were killed, and that he'd be getting the death penalty. Her "I lied" when he shouted that she said nobody was injured was positively gloating.
-   During the _Community_ pilot Britta promises Jeff a date if he'll stop the fighting he started. After Jeff uses his Manipulative Bastardry to calm the group down, she uses these words exactly.
-   _CSI: NY_:

    -   In "Point of No Return," Stella promises George Kolovos that she won't send him to Cyprus (where he's a wanted criminal) in a shipping container if he gives up his partner Sebastian Diakos. He does...and she locks him in the container anyway.
    
    **Kolovos**: Wait, we had a deal!
    
    **Stella**: I lied.
    
-   _Dexter_: When Dexter Morgan goes back on a promise to set a victim free: "You think I'm a killer, and not a liar?"
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "The Runaway Bride": The Doctor, to Donna, regarding the TARDIS and its status as a time machine.
        
        **The Doctor:** Do you know what I said before, about a time machine? Well, I lied, and now it's time to use it.
        
    -   "The Next Doctor":
        
        **Miss Hartigan:** But you promised me, you said I would never be converted!  
        **Cyber-Leader:** That was designated: a lie.
        
    -   "Planet of the Dead": Christina, right before kissing the Doctor:
        
        "Remember when I said I hated you? I was lying."
        
    -   Practically River Song's catch phrase. The Eleventh Doctor gets in on the action a lot, too. Basically, any time River and Eleven are on screen together, they're lying to each other, to the companions, and to you.
    -   Rule #1: The Doctor Lies.
    -   "The Time of Angels":
        
        **River:** This won't hurt a bit. _\[injects Amy, who cringes\]_ There, you see? I lied.
        
        -   Rory and his dad in "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship", in an almost exact mirror of the River-Amy scene. Which shows where River got it from.
        -   Again by the Doctor to Clara in "The Name of the Doctor".
-   A heroic example in the _Elementary_ episode "Meet Your Maker". Holmes and Watson question a man who runs a site on the Dark Web for misogynists. Holmes points out the site is full of posts of men talking about raping and killing women, so if the man doesn't give them the information they need he'll turn him over to Homeland Security. Once the man gives the information, Holmes waves over the DHS agents who were watching.
    
    **Man:** But you promised you wouldn't tell them about me if I talked to you!  
    **Holmes:** Yes, but you play den mother to a pack of would-be rapists and mass shooters, so you can see how lying to you would be the highlight of my day.
    
-   In the _Emerald City_ episode "Everybody Lies", West promised Ojo that she would free his wife from the Prison of the Abject, in exchange for bringing her Dorothy. She didn't.
-   Done humorously on the _Father Ted_ episode "A Christmassy Ted". An award hungry priest decides to pose as another priest named Father Todd Unctious (even stealing Todd's clothes which Ted notes was pointless since he was already a priest) to get close to Ted to steal his recently won Golden Cleric award. Once caught he asks the police officer present to if everything he says is off the record. The officer agrees so he delivers a full confession. The officer after reveals that it was a lie and it was all in fact on the record, much to the thief's disappointment.
    
    **Police Sergeant:** Well, I got bad news for you so-called Todd Unctious. That wasn't off the record. I'm using that as evidence against you.  
    **(Fake)Todd:** Ah that's completely unfair!
    
-   _The Flash (2014):_ After the Flash enlists Captain Cold's help, and gets double-crossed:
    
    **Flash:** You gave me your word!  
    **Captain Cold:** It's true I did, but here's the thing: I'm a criminal and a liar and I hurt people and I rob them.
    
-   On one episode of _Frasier_, Martin tries to trick Niles into signing a document so that he won't have to go get a physical, by having a cop friend of his pull them over and offer to flash his badge and get him out of the ticket only if he signed. After Niles apparently does so Martin says, "I lied," and explains the ruse to him. Niles responds, "_I_ lied. I just drew you a picture of a dog."
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Littlefinger says "I did warn you not to trust me," when he proves why. This is actually a Double Subversion as Littlefinger was being perfectly honest when he warned Ned not to trust him. Still, he was relying on Ned falling for a Sarcastic Confession.
    -   Reek delivers the promise of safe conduct to the Ironborn garrison at Moat Cailin if they surrender. Unfortunately, Ramsay is a man of tradition and has a bad habit of flaying people he promised to spare.
        
        **Ramsay:** "You didn't think I was going to let them go, did you?"
        
    -   Polliver tells the injured Lommy that he'll carry him, then sinks a sword in Lommy's throat.
-   Played for Laughs (duh) by comedy duo Hale and Pace in their role as the managers of their own show. "We promised not to blow the budget..." (lights go own, budget very obviously blown) "...we lied."
-   In _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_, Ares allows Hercules to marry Serena, a Golden Hind, _if_ he gave his godly powers, and Hercules agrees to this. However, in the next episode, "Judgment Day", Serena is found dead and Hercules is blamed for it. Not surprisingly, Ares and his nephew, Strife, were the ones responsible for it.
    
    **Iolaus:** You reneged on your deal, Ares. You said if he gave up his powers, he’d be happily married.
    
    **Ares:** I lied. So what?
    
-   _Heroes_:
    
    _\[Matt traps Sylar in his own mind\]_  
    **Sylar:** _\[unbelieving\]_ You said you would help me.  
    **Matt:** Yeah, well... Guess there is still a little of you left inside me. Because I lied. Enjoy hell.
    
-   _Kamen Rider Gaim_ has Ryoma Sengoku pulling this after fatally operating on Mai to remove the Forbidden Fruit from her.
    
    **Micchy:** You... you said you'd save Mai...  
    **Ryoma:** And I haven't the faintest idea why you believed me.
    
-   In an episode of _Law & Order_, Detective Phil Cerreta poses as an insurance salesman in a sting on a sex worker. After the police come in and arrest her, she, believing in Must State If You're a Cop, says, "I thought you said you weren't a cop!" Cerreta gleefully replies, "I lied!"
-   _Law & Order: Criminal Intent_: In the pilot episode, Goren tells the girlfriend of the episode's Big Bad that her boyfriend has HIV and has infected her. After the duo are arrested, he admits the deception.
    
    **Gia:** _\[to her boyfriend\]_ We're already dead. You killed us.  
    **Eames:** _\[straight-faced\]_ Guess again, Gia. You're gonna live a long, happy life.  
    _\[Beat while Gia looks at Goren in surprise\]_  
    **Goren:** I lied. Sorry.
    
-   _Lost_:
    -   Ben Linus should have this printed on a t-shirt.
    -   Also said by Sun Kwon after silencing Ben himself with an oar to the head.
-   _M\*A\*S\*H_:
    -   Implied in the episode "Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?" Col. Flagg confronts Dr. Sidney Freedman and points out the latter never swore an oath to the U.S. Army. Sidney tells him that if he were a communist spy, he wouldn't hesitate to take the oath because he would already be a lying traitor.
    -   "A Smattering Of Intelligence" has two government agents (Col. Flagg and Trapper's old friend Vinnie Pratt) looking for security leaks at the 4077th, only they seem to be chasing each others' tails. Hawkeye and Trapper give them the runaround by embellishing Frank's file with both left and right wing violations, so when Flagg and Pratt try to arrest Frank for it:
        
        **Frank:** It's a lie! They're all lies!!  
        **Pratt:** Well, _somebody's_ lying.  
        **Trapper:** Right. And we know who it is.  
        **Hawkeye**: (_joining Trapper shoulder to shoulder_) It's us!
        
-   Used by the villain in the first episode of _My Own Worst Enemy_. This, however, was an act. His alter-ego Edward anticipated the betrayal and coached Henry on what to do and say.
    
    **Henry:** We had a deal. I get you Fainburg's marbles, you leave my family alone!  
    **Uzi:** I lied.
    
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_:
    -   Mike points out Pearl Forrester promised that she wouldn't make them watch any more bad movies if he and the 'bots helped him. Mike and the robots _knew_ she would break her word, and helped her because it benefited them. (Servo told Mike, "I don't want to have to see _you_ in a toga.")
        
        **Pearl:** _\[thoughtfully\]_ You know, I think I lie because I'm evil.
        
    -   Earlier in the series, Forrester and Erhardt would respond to Joel's accusation of lying with, "What do you want from us? WE'RE EVIL!"
-   _Once Upon a Time in Wonderland_: Unsurprisingly, the Red Queen doesn't fulfill her promise to help Alice find Cyrus...at first, anyway.
-   _Power Rangers in Space_: Stated word-for-word during the Psycho Rangers' arc by Psycho Yellow, after she betrays Psycho Pink:
    
    **Psycho Pink:** But you promised it would be pink!  
    **Psycho Yellow:** I lied!
    
    -   For the _Power Rangers_ series overall, it's honestly easier to list all the times where a villain _hasn't_ pulled this trope on the titular heroes. The first well-known instance is in the original _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ when the heroes' parents and friends are abducted and Goldar demands that they hand over their Power Coins in exchange for their lives. The Rangers comply, only for Goldar to smugly tell them that they were fools to trust his word and saying that since he intends to destroy the world, there's no reason to give back their parents. If it hadn't been for his forgetting about Tommy's Dragon Power Coin, the Rangers would've been done for.
    -   In the Turbo movie, the space pirate Divatox gives the ultimatum "trade Larigot for your friends (Jason and Kimberly) or I'll destroy them". The result goes about as well as the above with Goldar; Divatox shoots torpedos at the rangers and takes Larigot without giving anyone back.
-   A Bill Cullen telecast of _The Price Is Right_ had all contestants overbidding on an item, which meant nobody won it. Bill notes that there was a bonus involved where somebody could win $80,000. After the audience gasps and murmurs subside, Bill snarks "So I lied a little!"
-   _Red Dwarf_, episode "Justice": Lister and the Simulant agree to come unarmed to "talk":
    
    **Simulant:** Guess what? _\[pulls out hunting knife\]_ I lied.  
    **Lister:** Guess what? _\[allows pole to slide from the arm of his jacket\]_ So did I.  
    **Simulant:** But I lied twice. _\[pulls out a handgun\]_  
    **Lister:** I didn't think of that.
    
-   _Scrubs_:
    -   After J.D protests at not being invited to the christening of Dr. Cox's son.
        
        **Doctor Cox:** Of course you're coming. In fact I want you to be the baby's godfather.  
        **J.D.:** _\[whispering emotionally\]_ I... am... honored.  
        **Doctor Cox:** _\[imitating him\]_ I... am lying.  
        _\[Turk and Carla nearly burst with suppressed laughter\]_  
        **J.D.:** I'm not sure I see how that's funny. _\[wipes away tear\]_
        
    -   In an earlier episode, the Janitor offers to drive J.D. to his then-girlfriend Molly the night before she's due to leave... and dumps him on the highway instead. "It's been _four years_. How do you not get how this works yet?"
-   Heroic example from _Star Trek: Enterprise_.
    
    **Klingon General:** You were supposed to be creating Augments!  
    **Phlox:** I lied.
    
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_:
    -   In "Skin of Evil," Armus, the titular skin of evil, tells Troi that the _Enterprise_ crew won't be coming back. Later...
        
        **Armus**: I lied to you. They came back.
        
    -   "Captain's Holiday": Beverly is trying to convince Captain Picard to take a vacation. Picard is adamant, and she tells him that it's _going_ on a vacation that he hates, but once he gets there, he has a great time. She reminds him of him telling her about how he had a great time during his four days on Zytchin III, to which he replies "I lied." Given that he's trying to wheedle desperately out of the vacation, this itself is likely a lie.
-   _Chris Ryan's Strike Back_ (_Origins_ in the US): Hakim Al-Nazeri, leader of an Iraqi terrorist group, vows to kill John Porter first, followed by the reporter he was attempting to rescue when he was captured. Come the morning of the execution, Al-Nazeri drags the reporter off first, prompting this exchange:
    
    **Porter:** Hakim, you bastard, you said you'd take me first!  
    **Al-Nazeri:** I lied.
    
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   Dean Winchester is trying frantically to save his daddy when he gets stonewalled by a demon. He tortures her, bargains for information, then sends her back to burn in hell with this trope.
        
        **Meg:** You son of a bitch, you promised.  
        **Dean:** _\[snarling right in her face\]_ I lied!
        
    -   Abaddon, a demon in one of the later seasons, is really fond of using this trope. On several occasions she forces someone into a bargain by taking their friends captive, but _will_ decide to kill everyone anyway after getting what she wants.
-   _Tales from the Crypt_: The duped love interest of a bottom-feeding tabloid reporter ends an episode by removing her pretty face and revealing her fanged, pallid, bald head: "I said I didn't eat meat. I lied."
-   _The West Wing_ features Arnie Vinick pulling one in response to having been caught lying to the religious right. His secretary yanks the rug out from under him.
    
    **Vinick:** Are you finished?  
    **Sheila:** Oh yeah.  
    \[...\]  
    **Sheila:** _\[sudden outburst\]_ I could have told you that wouldn't work! That he would leak it and you'd be forced to confirm or deny it!  
    **Vinick:** I thought you said you were done?  
    **Sheila:** _I lied!_
    
-   One memetic scene from _Wonder Showzen_:
    
    **Wordsworth:** Uh, Chauncey, you promised I could deliver my extended comprehensive lecture about the significance of honesty!  
    **Chauncey:** I did?  
    **Wordsworth:** Yes.  
    **Chauncey:** I lied. _\[looks to camera, fart sound plays\]_
    
-   _The X-Files_: Used in the episode "Shadows", though not in a sinister way. Mulder lies to the doctors who called him, saying he can't help them, as he's never seen anything like their case before. He was lying, though given that the team that requested his help were stingy on the details, it was more of a snarky revenge.

    Music 

-   "Believe Me Baby (I Lied)" by Trisha Yearwood:
    
    When I said it would suit me fine  
    If you were out of sight and out of mind  
    That wasn't me talking, that was my foolish pride  
    When I said I didn't want your love  
    And you were no one I was thinking of  
    Believe me, baby, I lied
    
-   "Halloween" by Stephen Lynch:
    
    I promise I'll let you go home  
    If you swear not to tell a soul  
    So I'll just untie these... I'm kidding  
    Now, where is my chainsaw? Let's rock and roll
    

    Pro Wrestling 

-   In an example of an actual _good_ guy doing this, WWE's Eddie Guerrero (RIP) would do this all the time as part of his "lie, cheat, steal" gimmick. Usually he would enter into a match with a heel, promising not to cheat during the match. Then, when he won as a result of cheating and was called out on it, he would shout to his opponent, "I lied, homes!" causing the audience to roar with approval.
-   This trope would also be played with when he teamed up with his nephew Chavo Guerrero Jr.. He'd tell him, "We may lie, cheat and steal, but at least we're _honest_ about it!"
-   On Night of Champions 2010, Chris Jericho participated in a Six-man elimination match for the WWE Championship with a personal promise that, should he fail to win, he will leave _WWE_ for good. Naturally, when he quickly lost during the match, the 'net was in an uproar since that was not the way for someone as popular as Jericho to go... then he appeared on the next episode on _WWE Raw_ with this little message on his Twitter account.
    
    **Chris Jericho:** Hey Internet... I'm a heel. Heels lie, therefore if I say something boastfully and renege on it, it's not an official stipulation. Smarten up!
    
    -   Only to actually leave two weeks later via Randy Orton's patented punt to the head.
-   In 2014, Seth Rollins and his flunkies took an injured Edge hostage and threatened him unless John Cena reinstated The Authority. Cena gave in to his demands, only for Rollins to say he was going to kill Edge anyway. He attempted to stomp on Edge's head, but Cena was fast enough to get in the ring and stop him.
-   At Extreme Rules 2022, Edge faced Finn Balor in an "I Quit" match. After several people interfered, Rhea Ripley knocked Edge's wife Beth Phoenix out and threatened to bash her brains in with a chair unless Edge quit. Edge quit, but Ripley hit Phoenix in the head with the chair anyway.

    Radio 

-   In the 25th anniversary episode of _I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again_, David has managed to get John to participate in the show with the promise that he can do the silly walk. When David's in a spree of megalomania, John brings this up.
    
    **David:** Look, I'm the Prince of Darkness. My promises mean nothing.
    
-   _Old Harry's Game:_ At one point, Satan declares this is one of the _perks_ of being the Devil.

    Tabletop Games 

-   There's a card in the CCG _Illuminati: New World Order_ that's _called_ "I Lied." If you make an otherwise binding deal, then play that card, the other player has to keep his end of the bargain but you don't.
    -   According to legend, the first ever official tournament was won when, after a long and grueling final game, one of the finalists convinced the other to throw the game in return for half the prize money, then played this card. The judges ruled it was perfectly legal and keeping with the spirit of the game and declared that player the winner, over the protests of his opponent.

    Theatre 

-   A heartwarming variation occurs in the play _Mass Appeal_, in which Catholic priest Father Farley mentors Mark, a young, progressive deacon who has earned more than a few side-eyes for his non-traditional beliefs. When Mark is first assigned to Father Farley, Farley tells Mark that the local monsignor forced the arrangement on him, but later admits that this was a lie — Father Farley actually _asked_ to mentor Mark because he believed the Church needed more progressive thinkers.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Video Games 

-   _World of Warcraft_ pays homage to the _Commando_ example (see Films, above) with Lieutenant General Adorov in the Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj before the General Rajaxx fight. Interestingly enough, given the way the fight works- waves of enemies will come at you and Adorov until you face Rajaxx himself- you will have to kill Rajaxx last if you're doing it normally.
-   _StarCraft: Brood War_, and the main reason Kerrigan really works as a villain.
    
    **Mengsk:** Kerrigan, you murdering bitch! We had a deal!  
    **Kerrigan:** Oh, come on, Arcturus. Did you really think I'd allow you to come into power again? You practically fed me to the Zerg on Tarsonis! You're directly responsible for the hell I've been through! Did you honestly think I'd let you get away with that?  
    **Mengsk:** But you said revenge was secondary to defeating the UED!  
    **Kerrigan:** I lied. I liberated this planet because it was the UED's primary staging point, not because I was under any obligation to you. I used you to destroy the Psi Disrupter. And now that I've got my Broods back, you're no longer necessary for my plans. I think I'll leave you here, Arcturus, among the ashes of your precious Dominion. I want you to live to see me rise to power. And I want you to always remember in your most private moments that it was you who turned me loose in the first place.
    
-   _Star Wars Expanded Universe_:
    -   Shows up in _The Force Unleashed_. After Starkiller gathers the leaders of the soon-to-be Rebel Alliance in an attempt to distract the Emperor long enough for him and Vader to stage a coup, Vader himself crashes the party and tells his "apprentice" that the whole coup plan was a ploy to get all the rebels in one place and capture them in one swoop.
        
        **Starkiller:** You told me you'd stay away!  
        **Vader:** _I lied,_ as I have from the very beginning.
        
    -   It's just a bad idea to believe Vader — he may tell the truth in broad statements, but he's not good with promises. Even when he'd be better off keeping his word. As was the case in this scenario.
    -   Also shows up in the dark side ending of the sequel:
        
        **Vader:** I lied when I said the cloning process was not yet perfected.
        
-   _Advance Wars: Days of Ruin_: Caulder/Stolos employs this in response to The Mayor's protests that the former promised the civilians food, supplies and a cure to The Virus they're infected with if they handed over Isabella/Catleia. He then tops it off by revealing that the medicine sample he'd just handed over to the Mayor as a gesture of goodwill (which he'd immediately taken), well:
    
    **Caulder:** Oh, and that medicine you took was not the antidote. Hello? Can you hear me? Mr. Mayor? ...Fascinating.
    
-   _Portal_: After an "unsupervised" test early in the game, GLaDOS admits that she lied about it being unsupervised. Then she promises to stop enhancing the truth "in three... two... _(static)_"
-   _Portal 2_:
    -   In Chapter three, GLaDOS says that she has a "surprise" for Chell, which she heavily hints to be reuniting with her parents. But when the time comes to present it to her, Chell is met with an empty room.
        
        **GLaDOS:** I made it all up. _\[party horn and confetti\]_ Surprise.
        
    -   Right before the final battle against Wheatley, he attempts to get your hopes up before immediately ripping it away.
        
        **Wheatley:** Tell you what, this plan is so good, I'll give you a sporting chance... And turn off the neurotoxin! I'm joking, of course. _Goodbye._
        
-   A villain ends up on the wrong end of this from The Man Behind the Man in _Last Scenario_:
-   In _Baroque_, the Coffin Man pulls a decidedly non-villainous one of these on the protagonist (and the player). In one of his Tutorial Dungeons, after teaching you the basics of combat, he announces that there are a whole lot of tough Meta-Beings on the next floor, so you'd better be prepared! Once you descend to the next floor, you find it empty, and the Coffin Man laughingly says, "I'm a liar."
-   _Professor Layton and the Unwound Future_ features Dimitri Allen's picross map. He gave it to Layton, telling him that the map, when marked, showed the location of the infrared sensors he rigged the building with. However, after solving the picross map, turning the map 180 degrees reveals that all you did was spell LIE upside down. Layton isn't entirely surprised, as he concludes that while Dmitri has done some less-than-moral things in pursuit of his (well-intentioned) goal, he isn't willing to kill people.
    
    The European version (_...and the Lost Future_) has a slightly different puzzle, but the effect is the same. Dimitri claims to have set bombs in the Thames Arms, and gives you the map and challenges you to find them before they go off. The locations of the alleged "bombs" spell out exactly how much time you have left: infinity.
    
-   _Tales of Symphonia_:
    -   Zelos ends up uttering a variant of the line when he takes a Face–Heel Turn and betrays the party to Yggdrassil during the climax. In all but one of the endings, the line gets a reprise when it turned out he was a Fake Defector and betrays Yggdrassil to the party's benefit.
    -   Earlier in the game, Lloyd invokes this trope in conversation with Colette for a different reason. He brings her a cup of coffee, which she notes to be pleasantly hot. Lloyd chides her, informing Colette that the coffee is iced. Flustered, she comments on the "cool" drink, only for Lloyd to reveal the coffee was always hot: "I lied...". This exchange confirms Lloyd's suspicion that Colette has lost her sense of touch.
-   _Dragon Age II_ has an unusual Anti-Hero example in Fenris, who promises a magister that he'll let her go if she tells him where his long-lost sister is. She tells him - then Fenris reaches into her chest and crushes her heart.
-   _Resident Evil 6_: He doesn't outright say he lied, but Simmons certainly counts. In order to force Helena to help him in his scheme to whack the President, he kidnaps Helena's little sister, promising to let her go after she does her part. From the very beginning, he has no intention of making good on the bargain, and even before Helena does her part, he has said little sister mutated by the C-Virus, intending to have Helena used as a scapegoat and then killed in the subsequent nuking of Tall Oaks. When Helena realizes this, she is _not_ happy.
-   A rare heroic version in _Final Fantasy Adventure_. Robot Buddy Marcie is with the hero on a collapsing tower, but the way to the final dungeon is before them. She offers to throw the hero and jump after him, which the hero agrees to. However, once the hero across safely and asks Marcie to jump, Marcie admits to its lie - it chose to lie because the hero would have wasted too much time trying to save Marcie if he knew the truth, and both would have died in the tower collapse.
-   Hades from _Kid Icarus: Uprising_ switches between this and blatant lying, whichever he thinks would be more entertaining at the time. There's one mission where Pit runs into three Chest Monsters in a row(called Mimicuties), but neither of the two villains present actually confess to putting them there, leaving it a mystery. Until the next mission:
    
    **Hades:** Full disclosure here: the mimicuties were courtesy of yours truly.  
    **Pit:** It WAS you!
    
-   Used for dramatic purposes in _Tsukimi Planet_. If Utarou makes a wish to live longer, Tsukimi regretfully states that she lied about being able to grant wishes. In despair, she falls to her death, hoping to be able to meet Utarou in the afterlife.
-   In _Persona 4_, during Yumi's version of the Sun Social Link, at one session of drama club, a fellow student runs in and tells Yumi that her mother collapsed. When Yumi gets to the hospital, she learns that her mother is fine, but that her father was hospitalized, and her mother admits that she lied in order to get Yumi to see her father before she dies. Yumi is furious with her mother, but mainly because she's bitter about her mother looking after the man who abandoned her and Yumi for another woman, who then abandoned him while he was dying.
-   In the _Make a Good Mega Man Level Contest_, Air Man appears as an NPC saying that he won't make an "I Can't Defeat Air Man" joke. Late in the game, he appears in a boss fight with that song playing in the background, with "I LIED" appearing just before the fight.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series, this is a trait of Molag Bal, Daedric Prince of Domination and Corruption and the closest thing to a true God of Evil in the _ES_ universe. He ultimately does not keep his word with his minions. "Rewards" are given solely for the purpose of creating a more useful or obedient minion, and remaining in his service will ultimately result in the servant only being rewarded with slavery and endless torment.
-   In _Atelier Firis: The Alchemist and the Mysterious Journey_, Aurelie, the village elder of Dona, is seemingly a frail old lady who, according to her, can't even walk. So it comes as a great surprised to Firis and Liane when she asks them to meet her at the Divine Tree, then gets up to head there.
    
    **Aurelie**: Oh, I lied. I'm not that decrepit yet. Hahahahaha!
    
-   _Mortal Kombat 11_ has a heroic example in the end of the _Aftermath_ storyline. Fire God Liu Kang seemingly stays behind so Shang Tsung can defeat Kronika and take her crown to reshape time itself. Right before he does, Liu Kang shows up to confront him, and that's when Shang Tsung realizes he's been played all this time.
    
    **Shang Tsung**: Liu Kang. I thought your duties required that you stay behind.  
    **Liu Kang**: A lie. Something you know well.

-   In _Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius_, the titular villain makes a deal with the king of Ryuvia: marry off the king’s only daughter to Arcadius, and he will spare Ryuvia from a PACT invasion and guarantee the planet some measure of autonomy within his empire. The very instant that the wedding ceremony is complete, Arcadius shoots the king, mocks him for thinking that their agreement was worth a damn, and annexes the planet anyway.
-   Happens quite a bit in _Ace Attorney_, particularly from witnesses who give false testimony. A particularly glaring example comes in _Spirit of Justice_. One of the witnesses is eventually revealed to be an escaped rebel who just happened to end up at the crime scene, where he hit his head and gained temporary amnesia. Consequently, literally _everything_ in his testimony was made up.
    
    **Datz:** In short, all my eyewitness testimony was a big fat lie.  
    **Phoenix:** A big, fat, LIIIIEEE?!
    
-   In _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_, at the end of Nagito Komaeda's Free Time Events, he claims to have Stage 3 malignant lymphoma, along with frontotemporal dementia. After telling his story, he claims to have read it all in a book in order to gain sympathy from Hajime. It's unclear whether this is a lie or he abruptly changed his mind and backed off of the story.

        **Big Time:** An' there's one more thing I lied about. When I said I couldn't kill ya, I meant I couldn't do it then... But now... I made you an offer, and ya turned it down. Where's the respect?
