Boas and Pythons, Brother!

Wearing feathers for fashion is almost always to show the wearer is trying to show some measure of style, sophistication, and wealth.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  There aren't any ceremonial reasons for trying to look/be like a bird, the feathers are being worn just to look glamorous. Whether wearing large plumes, or trimmings of down feathers, it's all fashionable, in both fiction or in Real Life.

Common forms are feathers on hand fans, feather boas, plumes on hats, trimming a rich lady's nightgown, trimming Pimped Out Dresses, trimming Sexy Santa Dresses, and decorating headdresses and showgirl skirts on dancers and showgirls in nightclubs.

Any examples of Peacock Girl, where the feathers are worn instead of a character having a peacock tail, would be examples of this.

Common in Costume Porn.

A Sister Trope to Pretty in Mink (often feathers are worn in a similar way as fur<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ).
