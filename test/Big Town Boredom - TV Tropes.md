_"Two years he walks the earth, no phone, no pool, no pets, no cigarettes. Ultimate freedom. An extremist. An aesthetic voyager whose home is the road. Escaped from Atlanta. Thou shalt not return, 'cause 'the West is the best.' And now after two rambling years comes the final and greatest adventure, the climactic battle to kill the false being within and victoriously conclude the spiritual revolution. Ten days and nights of freight trains and hitchhiking bring him to the great white North. No longer to be poisoned by civilization he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild."_

— **Alexander Supertramp (Chris McCandless)**, _Into the Wild_

People living in small towns often want to go big, but the opposite is also equally occurrent. The opposite trope to Small Town Boredom, this trope involves characters who live in a big city or a suburb wishing they could move somewhere smaller, more traditional, or more natural, including a small town, a rural village, a farm, a ranch, or even just the plain old wilderness. In almost all of these cases, expect a heavy emphasis and focus on Arcadia, and the setting being an embodiment of it. As can be expected, it will pretty much always have a big emphasis on the city and the country. Will very often overlap with From New York to Nowhere.

Though this trope may be the opposite of Small Town Boredom, they still share several characteristics. Both of them are subtropes of Grass Is Greener and involve a character in one place wishing they were somewhere else. Both of them are also quintessential examples of Hated Hometown, as the characters' hatred for the place they live in is the entire reason for both of these tropes existing.

The reason and specifications of this trope can vary. In almost all cases they will be looking for a purpose in life, although the specifics can vary. In some cases, it may be a Call to Agriculture and the character simply wants to take up farming and live the associated simple life. In other cases, the character may be a Nature Lover who wants to be in a more natural place without skyscrapers, warehouses, factories, strip malls, and houses. In cases like these, the Suburbia, Polluted Wasteland, or Vice City could potentially be seen, although the city the character lives in does not necessarily have to be dangerous, corrupt, or polluted, and the character simply dislikes it for being a city. Many examples of this trope will go with the more traditional route of someone who wants an escape from their busy or unhappy life and to settle in a more quiet and peaceful place. In cases like this expect something heavily akin to The Shangri-La, either in landscape, the sense of peace and relief a character feels within it, or both. However, contrary to popular assumption, it's also possible that they want to go somewhere more rural or small for an adventure or mission. In cases like these, they may be searching for a Call to Adventure they can only find in a smaller or more rural place, in which case it's very likely to see the jungle adventure or the small town mystery.

Furthermore, other reasons for the character wanting to move there could be that they wanted to feel normal somewhere or that they wanted to be special. In cases of the former, maybe they've always felt their values are different from the fast-paced or materialistic city or suburb, or maybe they even had a physical difference that made them feel alienated. In cases of the latter, maybe they knew they would be just another number if they continued to stay there, and their qualities would only be appreciated in a simpler place. Whatever the case, expect a heavily romanticized vision of the place in the character's mind or its actual depiction as well, depending on the story.
