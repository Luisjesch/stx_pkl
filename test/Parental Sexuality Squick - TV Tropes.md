**Peter Quill:** I don't need to hear how my parents...  
**Drax:** Why? My father would tell the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.  
**Peter:** That's disgusting.  
**Drax:** _\[offended\]_ It was _beautiful!_ You Earthers have hang-ups!

Do you have parents? Are your parents human? Do you have any siblings, particularly any who are not your twin/triplet/etc?

If you have answered "yes" to any of these questions, then... it logically follows that your parents have had sex, at least once in their lives, and quite possibly more than once.

Of course...

-   You could be the product of In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF), informally called a "test-tube baby." But then, IVF is expensive, even when covered by insurance, and is generally only done after couples have been trying to conceive the old-fashioned way for a long period of time.
-   Your parents could be in a same-sex couple, and thus lacking all of the.. er, required equipment for procreation — but then, someone had to be responsible for either providing needed genetic material, or carrying the pre-born you to term. Even then, it's still quite likely your parents have sex, even if it's not the exact acts required for procreation.
-   You could be some kind of deity or demi-deity, arising out of a virgin birth — but statistically, that's so unlikely as to be impossible. And, as _Dogma_ pointed out, being the product of a virgin birth doesn't necessarily mean your parents didn't have sex after you showed up.

But I Digress. Now, **listen closely**: Your parents put Tab A into Slot B to bring you into the world.

Disgusting, isn't it?

In fiction, it's common enough to see a child react with curiosity to their parents in a Primal Scene. As they get older, however, say into double digits, the very _thought_ that their parents might be getting it on (or even their parents kissing in front of them, for the G-rated version) is enough to send them searching for the Brain Bleach. Usually by the time a child reaches their twenties, and is able to fully comprehend and empathize with sexual attraction and activity, this reaction lessens — generally from "Eww, gross!" to "I really didn't need to hear that, Dad." — although for comedic effect, it might not fully go away, as Peter Quill in the page quote above can attest to.

The inversion, a parent grossed out by their adult child's sexual antics, is not uncommon. Compare I Banged Your Mom, Affection-Hating Kid (though most affection that kids gag at in media is SFW), Old People are Nonsexual (the belief that aging should kill sexuality). Contrast The Talk, which can be used to prevent this.

    Advertising 

-   A DirectTV ad plays on this, with the son going home to be comforted by his parents after getting a high cable bill, only to see them in the middle of a group of elderly couples engaging in slow massages. Which results in the son driving away with tears in his eyes, which in turn has him driving into "a pizzeria that makes really good baked ziti."
-   One Clorox Bleach commercial has a woman fixing breakfast as her senior citizen parents have come for an overnight visit. The dad then says, "Better hurry up with those eggs. Your mother and I worked up quite the appetite last night," as the two exchange very telling looks. Cut to the daughter now washing her bedsheets. For life's "bleachable" moments, indeed.
-   One Downy ad involves a teen being squicked out when his grandparents come out of a closet with wrinkled clothes.
-   An IKEA commercial features a middle-aged couple gleefully chasing each other around the house to the sound of country music, she wearing lingerie and rubber boots and wielding a pitchfork, and he in his underwear and wearing a pig mask. They're abruptly interrupted by their adult daughter arriving home, accompanied by her boyfriend, and they all stare mortified at each other—until the parents and boyfriend crack up. The tag line inquires whether it may be time to move out. (The parents bursting out laughing makes it a nice example of normalizing the older people's sexuality in spite of the embarrassment.)
-   One ad for a reverse mortgage features an adult woman visiting her parents and hearing her father complaining about his bad back. The daughter believes that his bad back is due to the stairs in the house and suggests that her parents downsize. Her mother responds: "It wasn't the stairs. Actually, we love the stairs." and maintains significant eye contact as her daughter shudders at the implications.

    Comedy 

-   Jeff Foxworthy had a few short bits on the subjects. In one routine, Jeff recalls that when he first found out what the physical act of sex entailed, he couldn't imagine his parents doing that to each other.
    
    **Jeff Foxworthy:** I could never picture my mother screaming "give it up, you pot-bellied stallion!"
    
-   Comedian Christian Finnegan ends a bit on sex with the knowledge that your parents had sex. On a live recording, he goes into very explicit detail about making love with "your parents" as the subject. By the end, some audience members can be audibly heard _begging_ him to stop.
-   Christopher Titus sincerely regretted asking his father Ken about the circumstances of his birth, as Ken related how Titus was conceived. Unusually, there was a reason beyond this trope for Titus to regret it. Long story short: Titus' mother Juanita cheated on her then-boyfriend with Ken in order to conceive Titus. However, the boyfriend came home and started banging on the apartment door, Ken, realizing who was at the door, decided to "become the offender," hurling verbal jabs at the poor guy and give out a very loud reaction as he and Juanita had sex.
    
    **Ken:** Son, you were conceived during revenge sex.  
    **Titus:** ... Wow. (_twitches slightly_) That's just like the story of Christmas.
    

    Comic Books 

-   _Deadpool_: Deadpool runs into this with his and Shiklah's daughter, Warda in the 2099 story. Warda hates her father but thinks highly of her mother.
    
    **Warda:** What did Shiklah ever see in you anyway?  
    **Deadpool:** Well my nickname used to be The Merc with a Mouth, and let's just say I knew how to use it.  
    **Warda:** You're a gross old man!!
    
-   _Firebreather_: The protagonist is the son of a human woman and a dragon. Yes, a full-sized, reptilian one.
-   _Ms. Marvel_: This is downplayed in _Ms. Marvel: Beyond the Limit_, as more Parental Affection Squick — in the first issue, Kamala finds her parents being mushy and affectionate to be very off-putting.
    
    _Parental affection... it's almost enough to make me lose my appetite..._
    
-   _Nextwave_: The Captain mentions that one codename he considered was "Captain Avalon", after the Roxy Music album of the same name. He quickly decided not to do so after learning that his mom conceived him while listening to that album.
-   _Spider-Girl_: This is Mayday's reaction to hearing her mom's going to have another baby. Her thought process goes directly from "How could this happen?" to "EWWW!"
-   _Spider-Man_: In _Superior Spider-Man_, when Peter discovers he is able to rifle through Octavius's memories, he finds one of the night before Doc Ock's planned marriage to Aunt May (the plot of a real comic from 1973), and quickly tries to convince himself he hadn't.
-   _Supergirl_:
    -   _Supergirl (Rebirth)_: Downplayed. Supergirl _really_ doesn't like hearing her foster parents flirt when she's around (or when she is _not_ around — she can hear them from anywhere, literally). They are not concerned about her squicked reaction, though.
        
        **Jeremiah:** What I did miss?  
        **Edna:** Just the **launch**, Jeremiah. But the new uniform sure fits.  
        **Supergirl:** Comms are live. I can **hear** you two.  
        **Edna:** We're your **parents**, Kara. We're not **dead**.
        
    -   _Many Happy Returns_: Linda learns that her mother got pregnant. When their parents explain the hows and whys, she decides she did NOT need to know that.
        
        **Linda:** How did this happen?!  
        **Fred:** What—  
        **Linda:** Are you responsible for this?  
        **Fred:** What the hell kind of question's that?  
        **Linda:** Haven't you ever heard of protection?  
        **Fred:** I had a gun nearby. Didn't help.  
        **Sylvia:** Remember that afternoon you kind of surprised us, when your dad and I reconciled? Well, I think that's when...  
        **Linda:** Oh, I SO don't need to hear that! Jeez, Ma, you're too old old to be having—  
        **Sylvia:** Sex?  
        **Linda:** I was gonna say "a baby", but yeah, the other thing, too.
        
-   _Superman_: Jon accidentally discovers that, apparently, Lois has kept Clark's very-revealing gladiator costume from Warworld (which looks suspiciously like a piece of Superman-inspired leather S&M gear) in her and Clark's bedroom closet, and is utterly mortified by the implications.
-   _Tom Strong_: The 26th issue has Tom's daughter Tesla Strong express disgust at the realization that her parents are having sex as they are returning to Earth.

    Comic Strips 

-   Inverted in _9 Chickweed Lane_. Parents Amos and Edda discuss what their newborn children will think when they envision their parents having sex. "Can you for a moment imagine being our kids, thinking of us locked in an act of most private intimacy?" Apparently, imagining that turns them on.
-   Two characters in _Zits_ had the stories of their conceptions told to them, with horrible reactions.
    -   Jeremy is in his room playing "Stairway to Heaven" on his guitar (he always liked the song for some reason) when his mother mentions that he probably likes the song so much because he was conceived to it. Within minutes, he's rinsing his ears out and boiling his guitar strings.
    -   Hector's parents let slip that a batch of blueberry muffins burned during his conception. The very sight of a blueberry muffin results in severe nausea thereafter.
-   _FoxTrot_ had a story arc where Andy decided to discuss "the birds and the bees" with her teenage daughter Paige. Paige is shown to be incredibly uncomfortable, but one comic implies that it's because Andy keeps referencing her own relationship with husband Roger. ("So the boy might say 'C'mon, just one hickey'. That's what your father said...")
-   In _Baby Blues_, Zoe and Hammie have been known to act grossed out whenever they see Darryl and Wanda kiss, if only as a form of "entertainment." In one strip, when Darryl and Wanda catch Zoe and Hammie snickering as they kiss, Wanda asks them if they think it's funny when they kiss. Zoe replies no...just when they kiss each other.

    Fan Works 

-   Downplayed in _Amazing Fantasy_. After an Imagine Spot gives Izuku a Raging Stiffie, he desperately tries to get it to go away by trying to Think Unsexy Thoughts. One of the images he brings up is his Amazingly Embarrassing Parents kissing.
-   _The Arithmancer_: Upon finding out that Fleur is pregnant in Chapter 58 of Lady Archimedes due to forgetting to use the Contraceptive Charm, Molly remarks that Bill took after his father, and Arthur adds that she was referring to Ginny as she was conceived and born at the height of the war. The Weasley siblings respond in disgust to hearing about this.
-   Inverted in _Back to Zero_ when Cassidy casually talks about Jessie's sex life with their boss Giovanni. Unbeknownst to either Cassidy or Jessie, Giovanni is Jessie's father. Giovanni isn't exactly interested in hearing about his child's intimate life.
-   _The Black Sheep Dog Series_ has a disguised Sirius completely _mortified_ when his aunt Lucretia loudly discusses of the fact that his parents vigorously tried to conceive an heir every day, for four years, before his birth. At a party.
-   _Blanket_: After Taylor heals the long-term effects of her dad's stroke, leaving her exhausted, she wakes up to find that neither of her parents is in the room — but she can hear both their voices from the direction of the shower, and promptly leaves the house in search of _anything_ else to occupy her attention.
    
    Ew, ew, ew, ew, ewwww.
    
-   _The Bolt Chronicles_: Happens a few times in these stories, in all cases expressed using the phrase "TMI."
    -   In "The Autobiography", Penny is disgusted by the possibility that her mother may be looking at porn on her laptop.
    -   In "The Cameo", Bolt is embarrassed by his father's dissolute sex life.
-   To remain blissfully ignorant, Ivy in _The Booty Call_ very much insists that no one in her family, _including her parents_, has ever had sex.
-   _A Boy, a Girl and a Dog: The Leithian Script_: Elves don't find discussions concerning sex inappropriate or squicky, not even when it's about family members' sex lives, and they find funny how humans make a big deal of it.
    
    **Soldier:** \[nodding\] I don't see how she could have been right about it: he was able to touch the Silmaril, after all, and if mortal flesh were inherently corrupt that oughtn't have been possible. — How come Men are so peculiar about something as normal as the conception of their own offspring? I've never understood why you all make such an issue of it, especially since you need so many of them. Why would mortal parents want to pretend to their children that they just happen along out of thin air —  
    **Ranger:** — or under rocks, don't forget under rocks —  
    \[Beren covers his face with his hand, laughing in spite of himself\]  
    **Soldier:** — even when everyone knows it isn't true?  
    **First Guard:** \[musingly\] I think for the same reason that mortal children want to pretend the same thing. It's like the time we were visiting Eithel Sirion and there was a new human guardsman there who wanted to know what the celebration was for, and we told him, and after he finished coughing and someone fetched him a new drink, it turned out he thought we were joking.  
    **Third Guard:** You saying back, "You mean you don't remember it?" didn't help convince him otherwise. It was funny, but we never understood why the High King's Men would rather congratulate the Prince on his birth than his conception. It seemed like silly semantic games to me.  
    **Second Guard:** We could ask Beren instead of speculating.  
    **First Guard:** We could, but he'd just get even more embarrassed than he already is.
    
-   In _Daria_ fic _Camera Obscure_, by A.A. Pessimal, Quinn Morgendorffer is completely squicked out over her parents reviving a moribund sex life, and begs to spend the night sleeping in her sister's room. Daria pretends not to understand and makes her suffer before relenting.
    
    **Daria:** They're married. They got a licence to practice. Get over it.
    
-   _Child of the Storm_ has Harry develop a subdued variant on this in regards to his father, Thor (formerly incarnated as James Potter) and Jane. He's happy that they're happy, once he gets used to Jane, but he doesn't want to know the details — though he does sometimes act oblivious to force his father to try and explain things, thus embarrassing himself.
-   _The Dark Lords of Nerima_: In the last chapter of the sequel, Sailor Pluto mentions that the new timeline they've created will result in Chibi-Usa being conceived sooner. She glances over at Mamoru and Usagi and winces at the thought.
-   There is a _Meet the Robinsons_ fanfic, Dating Advice, where Lewis ends up swapping dating stories with his Kid from the Future Wilbur and mentions that one of the girls he dated prior to Franny (Wilbur's mother) helped him realize how much he liked kids; Wilbur comments on how disturbing he finds that. Lewis points out that he needs to like kids for Wilbur to exist; Wilbur counters "There are many things necessary for my existence that I don't like to think about." Lewis can't respond because he's laughing so hard.
-   _Describing The Series Via References_ features the main cast of _RWBY_ reading their series' memes. Several of those memes relate to either how sexy their parents are, or the sexual escapades of Ruby and Yang's father. The characters are suitably mortified.
-   The Season 3 Epilogue of _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_ has deleted scenes where Trunks talks to Bulma about how little she prepared him for Vegeta. She proceeds to, in this deleted scene, talk about how she and Vegeta had sex and Bulma went along with it.
    
    **Bulma:** At that point, I figured "in for a penny, in for a pounding", and I _really_ was.  
    **Trunks:** \[External\] \[Screaming\]
    
-   In _A Few Needed Adjustments_, Keisuke is uncomfortable hearing Kyubi describing his past affair with Fumi. By contrast, Natsume (who just learned Kyubi is her biological dad) is just bored:
    
    **Kyubi:** She was so much more polite, kind, and beautiful than any other lady.  
    **Keisuke:** OK, I'm not listening to you gross people anymore.  
    **Kyubi:** I didn't know she was married at first. I just saw, conquered, and came.  
    **Keisuke:** OK, Natsume, I'm just going to bed, my fingers are not working.
    
-   _Fifth Year Rebooted_:
    
    **Harry:** Erm, one of the enchantments that aren't active anymore was… like… a contraceptive?  
    **Dudley:** I don't want to think about my parents doing that!  
    **Harry:** Me neither!
    
-   Inverted in _Gabriel gets used to... (Adrien having a Girlfriend)_. There, it's Gabriel who is forced to order extra soap to wash out his eyes whenever he encounters evidence that his son's relationship with Marinette progresses as expected for their age rather than seven to ten years younger.
-   _Hero Chat_: The heroes discuss Hawkmoth having a bird kink after he Akumatizes Jagged Stone into the bird-themed "Canary", complete with Glam Rock makeup and fishnet stockings. Luka asks if they can kinkshame Hawkmoth another time since said Akuma was his dad, but to no avail.
-   _How the Light Gets In_:
    -   Thea is horrified when she walks in on Dean about to go down on Laurel. They're both a Parental Substitute to her, so it counts as this. A thoroughly amused Sara then makes the situation even worse for Thea.
        
        **Sara:** It's been like half a year, dude. Of course they're gonna fuck tonight. Probably more than once. In different positions and everything.  
        **Thea:** Oh, god. Please don't talk about them _fucking_ in _different positions_.  
        **Sara:** Okay, they'll just stay in the one position.  
        **Dean:** Did you think we were sexless beings?  
        **Thea:** Yes!  
        **Dean:** Oh. Right. Well, okay then. You're right. We don't have sex. In fact, we're virgins. Mary was an immaculate conception. Better?
        
    -   Sara then starts to talk about the time she walked in on her parents having sex, only to be cut off by Laurel
        
        **Laurel:** Oh, please don't tell the hide and seek story again. I want to have sex tonight. I don't want to think about my parents.  
        **Sara:** Eh, point taken.
        
-   _Just The Three Of Us_, an Amphibia fic, has Anne dealing with this in her twenties when she and her girlfriends Sasha and Marcy accidentally get some of her parents 'private photos' mixed in with some Halloween stuff. This trope is not helped out by the fact that Sasha and Marcy think Anne's mom's still pretty hot, so Anne's both mortified by seeing her mom in sexy poses for her father _and_ by Sasha calling her mom a 'caramel milf-shake'.
-   _Kris Performs Surgery_: In episode 101, Carci mentions that Optica (the Anthropomorphic Personification of Rudy's frontal lobe) is forced to watch all of Rudy's repressed memories. When Rudy questions this, Carci gives "the time you walked in on your parents making you a baby bro when you were four" as an example, horrifying Rudy.
    
    **Rudy:** ...I did not need to be reminded of that.
    
-   _The Legend of Link: Lucky Number 13_:
    -   Link — using his godly insight — accidentally witnesses his parents having sex in a bathroom.
        
        **Link:** Today's life lesson: seeing your parents have sex is gross, even if you're a god.
        
    -   Later lampshaded by Fate:
-   _Lord Potter's Own Will_:
    
    **Harry:** My Dad is such a perv. Can't portrait people shag other portraits?  
    **Sirius:** I've no idea, why don't you ask your Mum or Dad when we get home?  
    **Harry:** Oh, hell no. Look, in my mind they only did it once, and that was to have me. No one should ever think about their parents shagging!
    
-   _Love Isn't What You Always Think It Is_:
    
    **Snape:** True. We have had some epic fights. I think the longest we went without speaking to each other was a week and it only lasted that long because someone was hurt and unconscious. I did thank you properly for quitting after that?  
    **Harry:** Yes, you did. Once I recovered, I believe you prescribed three more days of bed rest and we didn't do much resting.  
    **Septimus:** Ohhhh yuck, so didn't need to hear that. It's bad enough watching the two of you kissing but to hear you discussing that. Sorry, my parents are virgins.
    
-   In _Mass Effect: End of Days_, a human boy born to an Alliance AI and a human (It Makes Sense in Context) hears his mother discussing sexuality with Legion. Reaction... predictable.
-   In a _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ fanfic, set in the future, the original Rangers are now middle-aged, and their children are serving as Rangers. Kimberly is married to Rocky. They have seven children, including a set of twins. The oldest, 18-year-old Billy, finds out that the original Billy (now deceased) is his actual father, and Rocky isn't. In the end, that makes him feel _relieved_. Why? Because now he can imagine that Kimberly and Rocky have had sex only five times, instead of six.
-   _Multiversal Constants_ being an Alternate Dimension fanfic, it gives Jon and Damian the opportunity to react like this.
    -   Jon actually was a huge Shipper on Deck for his (alternate-future) parents, but when they finally get together and Conner jokes about Jon's counterpart being born nine months later, his reaction is a big pile of NOPE.
    -   To explain how wrong he finds alternate Dick crushing on Zatanna — who's MUCH older in his home dimension — Damian says it would be like his eldest brother was dating his mother.
-   In _My Old Kentucky Home_ Pandora Lovegood has an encounter with Narcissa Malfoy after feeding her marijuana brownies.
    
    **Lily:** Well as long as you didn't catch anything.  
    **Pandora:** She is very careful and I made certain I was as well.  
    **Harry:** Can we not talk about that. Parent sex is not cool.
    
-   _Naru-Hina Chronicles_: In Chapter 96, Naruto stumbles upon one of his dad's equipment satchels, which contains pictures of Minato and Kushina together... along with a picture of his mother naked. He's understandably mortified at the last one.
-   In _The Official Fanfiction University Of Middle-earth_, Legolas doesn't want to hear about his parents' romantic escapades.
    
    "Is it any wonder we get written as bunnies, doing everyone at every opportunity?" Legolas said darkly. To his amazement, his father only smiled.  
    "Alas, they do not realise that since we do not arrange marriages among Elves and marry only when we are most certain it is love, we like to enjoy the rewards of such a strong love. Your mother and I have enjoyed..."  
    This time, Legolas put his own hands over his ears and blocked the rest of the sentence out. Some things were the same, be you Elf, Human or Balrog. There were mental images concerning your parents that just weren't right.
    
-   In _The Official Fanfiction University of Redwall_, when the infamous "Of Warlords and Pleasures" fics come to the staff's attention, Veil Sixclaw is subject to this despite the Swartt Sixclaw fic being the least bad of the bunch.
-   This parody of _The Owl House_ has Amity discovering a hickey on her mother's neck, to which the twins quickly put two and two together; Amity is mortified, Edric is disgusted, but Emira is hopeful that they might get another sibling.
-   _Path Of Needles_: Sarada is grossed out when her parents reveal that they're having another baby. She thought they were "too old" to still be having sex, despite that Sasuke and Sakura are only thirty-three.
-   In _Pokémon_ fanfics that feature IronShipping (Byron/Riley), it is common for Roark, Byron's son, to express horror, shock, or disgust at the thought of his father and Riley (who is usually depicted as his childhood friend) sleeping together.
    -   In _One Stressful Week in Sunyshore_, after learning about Riley's crush on Byron, Roark goes home and promptly has a nightmare where he walks in on the two of them having sex and completely loses it.
        
        **Roark:** YOU'RE... LIKE... TWENTY YEARS OLDER THAN HIM, DAD!  
        **Riley:** Only seventeen years!
        
    -   In _That's Why I Love You_, Byron prepares a Valentine's Day gift for Roark and another for Riley, but gets the packages mixed up, resulting in Riley receiving a bag of candy and a stuffed Cranidos, while Roark gets a box containing imported dark chocolate and a man thong. He is not happy when he finds out who it's for.
        
        **Byron:** _(over the phone, as Roark is screaming in horror)_ Would you calm down already? Look, I'll come get 'em myself Monday and bring your gift with me.  
        **Roark:** I want twice as much candy for the psychological damage.  
        **Byron:** I'll give _you_ psychological damage!
        
-   Raz seems to find Milla and Sasha being affectionate with one another rather exasperating in _Razputin Vodello AU_.
-   Played with in _Recovery None_ as Church and Tex aren't Carolina's parents but are AI based off them. While fusing back together, they sound like they're having sex. Because Church was still connected to the comms system, that meant poor Carolina heard every detail. When Tex confirms that she and Church had sex (or the closest thing to it for an AI), Carolina is visibly queasy and nearly throws up.
-   In _Rising Heat_ by Solcane (NSFW), Adrien, when speaking to his father, keeps remembering how him and Marinette had Their First Time during a class tour. It's a rather embarrassing case of arousal he struggles to keep hidden... until Gabriel drops a few words implying Adrien was conceived during a similar trip, and possibly even at the same place.
-   In one episode of _Sailor Moon Abridged_, Serena, after being drained and trapped by a monster, awakes (naked for some reason) in a mental world with Luna. Believing she's dead (and therefore free from being Sailor Moon), she hugs Luna in joy, just as Queen Serenity shows up, leading to this conversation:
-   _Sakamoto vs. Takamaki_ has Jean Takamaki (Ann and Shiho's son born from insemination) invoke this on Natsumi Sakamoto (Ryuji and Hifumi's daughter) to get her to stop attacking him, by pointing out that since Natsumi's birthday is exactly nine months after Ryuji's birthday, she was essentially conceived as her father's birthday present, much to her horror. Unfortuently for him, it only lasts a few times before he jokes that she wore ribbons in her hair as a kid because she was her dad's birthday present, leading her to punch him in the face and runs off. He admits to a confused Yoshio Sakamoto that he had that coming.
-   In _Scorpius Malfoy and the Unwanted Attraction_ Scorpius is firmly convinced that his parents had sex only once, to consummate the marriage, and then conceived him via some vague magical process involving separate rooms.
-   _The Secret Return of Alex Mack_: Alex is incredibly grossed out when her mother mentions using a diaphragm. Given Alex's novel biochemistry, though, it's important to consider her contraceptive options...
-   In _The Shoebox Project_, the Marauders get The Talk. James gets it from his mom while his dad gives it to Sirius, and they argue over who had the worse experience.
    
    "She spoke about _her_ and _my dad_ and — you know."  
    "Oh God." Sirius peeks out from behind the curtain. "You win."
    
-   _Soda at 70 Proof_; Rachel gets grossed out when her parents tell her about how her mother Experimented in College:
    
    **Dad:** Cut your mother some slack. She means well. There was that whole phase she went through in college…  
    **Rachel:** Uh, la la la la la.  
    **Dad:** Heh, sorry. It's just that seeing her all over that other girl made me realize how jealous I was and how much I loved her.  
    **Rachel:** Ew! Can you censor yourself? Censor yourself in front of your daughter? Please?
    
-   _Son of the Sannin_: When Kurama is explaining to Naruto why he fears being sealed in the Gedo Mazo statue so much, he tells Naruto to imagine if someone tried to shove him back in his mother's womb, a comparison that makes Naruto scream in disgust.
-   Inverted and Played for Drama in _Strategy Sets the Scene for the Tale_ with Alicent Hightower, in order to show how deeply repressed and smothering she is. Being horrified by your son cheating on his fiancée with prostitutes might be justified, but feeling disgusted because your son has consensual, loving sex with his bride on their wedding night certainly _isn't_.
-   _Til Death Do Us Part_:
    -   Ash faints when he realizes what really occurred prior to a video-phone call he once gave. He remembers thinking it was weird that Professor Oak was wearing a bathrobe in the middle of the day and he swears he heard his mother's voice in the background. After the two reveal that they're a couple, Ash recognizes that he caught the two after having sex. He then faints again when Delia shows off her wedding ring.
    -   Ash has a mixed reaction to the news his mom and step-dad are having a baby. It's largely due to this but also partially due to jealousy.

But it gets worse for them by the end, when Jerry and the Beths reconcile via him watching them have sex in front of him, which quickly turns into Three-Way Sex...which, as shown in the video example, Rick, Morty, and Summer can hear in its entirety from downstairs at the dining room table. Unable to use a portal gun to escape the situation, the three of them can only sit and listen in misery and disgust, and it drives the kids to literal tears.
