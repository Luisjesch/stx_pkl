Comic Books and related media seem to love the idea of combining people with stuff Made of Shiny, hence the number of characters not just using Powered Armor but completely encased in a metal skin. It might be an organic metal skin, "liquid metal", or perhaps a super advanced Nanomachine suit of Powered Armor. Whatever the cause, the visual effect is of a transformed human with skin that is metallic, often silver, and polished to a mirror-like shine. If these figures go unclothed — and they usually do — Barbie Doll Anatomy will be in play.

These types generally have one of two power sets. They either are Nigh-Invulnerable and have Super-Strength or are fairly high up in terms of power, usually being Reality Warpers or in control of some fundamental natural force.

Their appearance usually explains their power. The connotations here are that the character is "as strong and tough as steel", or that they are the cosmic/human equivalent of a Magic Mirror, capable of "reflecting" on the nature of existence and deriving power from it.

Compare Star-Spangled Spandex, Carbon Skin, and Sculpted Physique, contrast with Tin Tyrant. Such characters are sometimes Metal Munchers in order to explain how they got/stay metallic. This is also a common ability for someone with Extra-ore-dinary powers.

-   Japan has the silver-and-blue _**PEPSI-MAAAAAAAAAAAN**_. He even has his own cult-classic PlayStation game.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Bleach_, Cang Du can coat his skin with a layer of iron to increase his durability.
-   Numerous _Digimon_ that are android type or have the prefix _Metal_ in it like MetalEtemon, MetalSeadramon, WarGreymon, OmegaShoutmon, ZekeGreymon, Shoutmon DX... Most of them wear an armor of Chrome Digizoid, a legendary metal.
-   Cooler from the _Dragon Ball_ movies looks like this after fusing with The Big Gete Star or rather his clones do.
-   In _Dragon Ball GT_, the final form of General Rilldo looks like a naked humanoid alien made of steel.
-   Gajeel from _Fairy Tail_ has this as part of his Iron Dragon Slayer magic via the aptly named "Iron Dragon's Scales", allowing him to coat his body in a layer of scales crafted from magical iron. He takes the time to note it's far tougher than regular iron during his fight with Natsu, who initially bruises his hands against it when usually he can punch through metal with little problem and has to put in real effort to get through. The armor even changes colors when he uses his Super Mode. At one point, he manages to turn his iron scales into steel via absorbing excess carbon from toxic waters an opponent was trying to drown him in.
-   Greed from _Fullmetal Alchemist_ has this ability to convert the carbon in his body into a diamond-hard skin that completely covers his body, but he generally dislikes the look of it and goes with a Partial Transformation.
    -   The same ability allows him to turn his body into graphite, which he uses to further damage Father when he's reabsorbed.
-   Setsuna becomes one of these at the end of _Gundam 00: A Wakening of the Trailblazer_.
-   DeVille of Huckebein from _Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force_, a huge axe-wielder whose entire body turns into black steel when he Reacts.
-   Tetsutetsu from _My Hero Academia_ have a quirk named "Steel" that allow him to turn his entire body into steel strong enough to get blows of considerable strenght with little damage, however he needs a diet rich in iron to maintain his quirk strong.
-   Mr. 1 from _One Piece_ ate the Supa Supa no Mi (Dice-Dice Fruit) which turned his body into one.
-   Diane from _The Seven Deadly Sins_ is capable of turning into one thanks to her Elemental Shapeshifter powers that she and other members of the Giant Clan have.

    Comic Books 

-   _Astro City_ has several:
    -   El Robo of the Irregulars is a muscular young man covered in steel.
    -   Steeljack is a former super-villain whose entire body is covered in living metal. It cuts down on his sense of touch, but he's completely human underneath. Worse, he's tarnishing with age, having been a supervillain for decades.
    -   In Los Angeles, the superhero Starpower is a silver man wrapped in a film strip, while the Platinum Blonde was a robotic villain who fought El Hombre.
-   An early '90s indie comic, _Chrome_, is about an astronaut who was melded with his silvery survival suit. Cut off from the outside world in the absence of electronic input.
-   _The DCU_:
    -   Waverider from _Armageddon 2001_ had parts of his body in a shiny metallic form when he became a time traveler.
    -   Captain Atom, Citizen Steel, and Bulleteer. Captain Atom is of the "cosmic" and "super strong" varieties, being a man with the substance of an extradimensional organism grafted to his flesh. Citizen Steel is super strong and tough, with the twist of having a very limited sense of touch due to his organic steel skin. The Bulleteer is super strong and tough, thanks to an accident involving metallic smartskin.
        -   Captain Atom's Evil Counterpart (and also a member of Green Lantern's Rogues Gallery) Major Force.
    -   Cyber-Cat, a very shiny cyborg assassin-thief with a cat theme who works for Talia Al-Ghul, fought Catwoman and later showed up as part of Circe's group of villains in "The Witch and the Warrior".
    -   Peter Platinum, the _DC One Million_ counterpart of Booster Gold, wears an advanced version of Booster's power suit that makes him look like he's completely coated in silvery material.
    -   August General in Iron, of the Great Ten, had his skin turned into living armor (which looks like rusted iron) as a side-effect of a cure for an alien infection. He also has an extremely stunted sense of touch.
    -   The _Green Lantern_ villain Goldface. GL's ring doesn't work on him because, you know, yellow... gold... same dif. His protege, _The Flash_ villain Blacksmith, is much the same. There's also Blacksmith's cohort, the slow-witted behemoth Girder, who got his powers from being thrown in a vat of molten slag from STAR Labs after trying to assault a female coworker. He also rusts _painfully_, and gets torn in half by Magenta's magnetic powers on more than one occasion.
    -   _Legion of Super-Heroes_: The Legion has Ferro Lad (or just Ferro in the Postboot version), who can become living iron at will, all the way to his core. The properties of his metal self allowed the Preboot version to make a Heroic Sacrifice by using himself as a conductor when the last-ditch weapon the Legion was using against a Sun Eater broke down.
    -   The _Metal Men_ are humanoid robots each made of a specific metal and properties to match: Lead is slow, tough and blocks radiation, Mercury can flow through cracks, etc. Most of them aren't actually _shiny_, though... Tina/Platinum, and Copper in the newer versions, are usually drawn to appear so, but the others, even Gold, generally aren't (and Mercury is _red_, probably for the same reasons the Marvel character of the same name has red hair). Lead is a dull grey, Tin (and Nameless, who's also made of tin) is a dull white, and Iron is a kind of blue (presumably he's supposed to be the color of a rifle barrel).
    -   _Superboy (1994)_ anti-villain Silver Sword is encased in a silvery substance that responds to his mental commands and works as armor, a morph-weapon, and a flight suit for him.
    -   Piston Force, a cousin of D.C. Force of _Superboy and the Ravers_, has silvery metallic skin, and his transformation is explicitly more than skin deep since his he no longer has human blood, instead possesses black circulatory fluid.
    -   For a time, Cyborg from the _Teen Titans_ had his soul transferred into a transformable alien robot called the Omegadrome. During this period, he basically looked like a gold version of the Silver Surfer.
    -   Bombshell of the Teen Titans. Her powers are derived from the same source as Captain Atom.
-   Capitan Rivet from _Empowered_.
-   _Family_: He isn't shown using it much, but Al apparently has the power to turn his body into metal.
-   _The Goon_ had Dr. Alloy, who was a Mad Scientist Anti-Villain Well-Intentioned Klutz. A few of the trade paperbacks include some design sketches for the character, with artist Eric Powell lamenting that too many of the early designs just look like the Silver Surfer cosplaying as Mr. Freeze.
-   _Marvel Universe_:
    -   _Avengers Academy_ has Mettle, who actually is a red variant compared to the standard silver.
    -   _Earth X_:
        -   Iron Maiden, who sounds like an Iron Man ripoff, but she's simply coated in Vibranium, which she can manipulate. Not very shiny, though.
        -   In _Universe X_, Doctor Doom is redeemed after he died and helped kill Death (don't think about that too hard). In the wake of that, he becomes one of Captain Marvel's archangels, and along with Iron Man has a completely metallic skin.
    -   Iron Man's new Model 51 'Endo-Sym' armor.
    -   Mercury of _New X-Men: Academy X_ is of the liquid metal variety... except her hair, which remains red for some reason. She's a shapeshifter instead of strong. The element mercury is associated with the color red for a couple of reasons: First, "Everyone knows" mercury is the stuff in thermometers; some thermometers are _clearly_ full of a red liquid. Second, Mercury _compounds_ are often red; vermilion and cinnabar are both mercury compounds.
    -   The Silver Surfer is the epitome of the cosmically powered Chrome Champion. A Zenn-Lavian granted a fraction of the Power Cosmic and coated with a radiation/pressure/cold-resistant metal shell, he's so powerful he's one of the few Flying Bricks who can easily best most characters in the MU. (At least a few stories have shown the Surfer's outer coating removed, leaving an ordinary-looking bald guy underneath. It's suggested that he requires said protection to fly through space and survive, but it's never explained why none of the other heralds of Galactus other than Nova seem to require it...)
        -   Galactus himself starts sporting this look in _Ultimate Hunger_ after merging with his _Ultimate Marvel_ counterpart Gah Lak Tus, a Hive Mind swarm of killer robots.
    -   _Spider-Man_:
        -   Spider-Man's foe The Molten Man, whose skin is bonded with a golden organic alloy.
        -   Robin Vega from _Spider-Man (1990)_ #82-83 is a mutant able to transform herself into any metal. She had shapeshifting, super strength and, if not Nigh-Invulnerable, at least she was Made of Iron. This was her only appearance, so she shined briefly. Given her abilities, it was a shame. Also kind of a living anvil against racism (in the form of Fantastic Racism).
    -   In _Ultimate Fantastic Four_, Victor Van Damme is transformed into a being of living metal by the teleportation experiment that he sabotaged.
    -   Colossus from _X-Men_ is a super-strong and tough type, who can transform at will from a normal (though fairly large and muscular) flesh-and-blood human to what the comics refer to as "organic" osmium steel).
-   _Vengeance of Vampirella_: The character Passion was a living construct of shiny silver metal. She was created by a woman who lost her son to werewolves to serve as an instrument of vengeance against evil-doers.
-   _Wetworks_: All members of Wetworks benefit from this trope, though they are golden rather than chrome.
-   _WildStorm_: Void and The Engineer. Void is a mysterious alien entity that bonded with a human woman, granting her teleportation and strange intuition. The Engineer is much like Iron Man, but has replaced her blood with Nanomachines which act as Swiss-Army Superpower — and extrudes some of it through the pores of her skin as skin-tight armor. Yes, she is essentially running around naked. She's an exhibitionist.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Take a Stand: The Broken Mirror_, Jason Alonso's power obtained from the Purple Sky incident is transforming his fur into razor-sharp metal.

    Film — Animation 

-   Jack Jack in _The Incredibles_ briefly becomes one of these as he "scrolls" through his powers.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   In _Fantastic Four (2005)_, Doctor Doom had metal "growing" under his skin and get revealed when the Human Torch attacks him with flames, though it's implied he's completely made of metal. _Rise of the Silver Surfer_ has him keep his powers but revert to flesh, and later return to his all metallic exterior when he steals the Silver Surfer's powers.
-   Brass Body in _The Man with the Iron Fists_, notable in that his skin is, well, brass colored.
-   The default form of the T-1000 Terminator in _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_, a nigh-invincible and shapeshifting Killer Robot made of metal liquid.
-   Colossus again in the _X-Men Film Series_.

    Literature 

-   In James Maxley's _Bitterwood_ series, some Atlantians wear their nanites as a skin, including the revived Jazz, who technically IS the skin. She remarks about its defensive qualities, being almost invulnerable to all harm excepting underspacial weapons.. In the epilogue, the dragon known as Hex keeps a gold-colored version that he gets from the villain and uses it to challenge any dragon bold enough to claim kingship.

-   _Codex Alera_: A sufficiently skilled Metalcrafter can manifest their Fury as a metal coating over their entire body, although only two characters in the series are shown to be able to actually do so. The First Lord, probably the most overall powerful crafter, turns into steel before flying to battle and blowing up the Citadel. Araris Valerian, widely regarded as the best metalcrafter on the planet, does this as well when fighting the Vord Queen (_and survives_). The transformation does have at least one obvious weakness, as the Vord Queen freezes him in place. Since his skin is metal, and it is turning brittle from the cold, it begins to cause Araris extreme pain.
-   In _Elantris_, before the Reod, the Elantrians have metallic silver skin that glows. However, it's not clear if their skin actually has any metallic properties beyond its appearance.
-   _Hyperion Cantos_:
    -   The Shrike and the four Nemes "siblings" in the Cantos.
    -   Also, Kassad and Moneta in the first book.
    -   Some of the Organic Technology skinsuits used later in the timeline also resemble this, compared to the Latex Space Suit\-style skinsuits of earlier eras.
-   _Moon Rainbow_: The Exotes (or, less derisive, Citgals) from Sergei Pavlov's series were initially a group of spacemen who acquired a whole bunch of cool powers due to contact and symbiotic relationship with a lifeform that is essentially a colony of living nanomachines. One most obvious manifestation of this relationship was the need to secrete a thick ooze of these nanomachines out of the skin, turning a host into a living metal statue. It was actually a part of the symbiote's lifecycle, but this layer could be controlled and used, for example, as a protective suit, enabling a man to survive a hard vacuum indefinitely.
-   _Nuklear Age_: Mighty Metallic Magno Man can turn himself into solid, animated tungsten and has magnetic powers.
-   A character in _Pandora's Star_ has such an extreme amount of implants and organic circuitry tattoos that his skin is golden, which conceals built-in weaponry and personal shielding.
-   _Secret Histories_: The Dreaded Drood family's signature armor is a seamless, featureless, impenetrable gold shell that's summoned out of their torcs. Justified since it's Magitek powered by a Sufficiently Advanced Alien from a higher plane of existence; wearers can see, breathe, and speak through the metal, and it can extend into Morph Weapons.
-   _Skolian Saga_: Thanks to genetic engineering, several members of the imperial family, while not actually made of gold, have metallic-golden skin, hair, and eyes.
-   _Worm_ features at least two:
    -   Weld, a boy literally made of metal. Weld's character actually explores some of the downsides to this power: since he cannot ever turn it off, his body is metal all the time, which means he can't feel sensation as well as most people, and his senses of smell and taste are practically nonexistent. He can eat, but generally requires much less food than normal and of course gets no enjoyment from it. His hearing is still fine, so he generally spends a lot of his free time listening to music. He also has a secondary power of absorbing metal into his body which he cannot control, so he has to be careful to avoid touching metal surfaces.
    -   Scion, who appears golden, but is sufficiently durable that his exact composition is unknown. Scion is actually composed of a close approximation of human flesh, and his durability is the result of him replacing damaged tissue with undamaged tissue he gets from a landmass-sized reservoir. He just makes himself _look_ golden because it looks godly.
-   Lord Melchor Blackburn from _The Zombie Knight_ is capable of turning into a living mass of mercury (or _several_ such masses) by combining the _pan-rozum_ hyper state with his native mercury transfiguration. General Lawrence can do the same, except with _radium_. Other servants with metallic transfiguration abilities can also invoke the trope, but not to the same extent.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Heroes_: Danny Pine, a minor character.
-   _The Invisible Man_: Subverted by Darien Fawlkes. There is a short window in between normal and completely invisible where the entire surface area of what's becoming invisible (usually himself) is a shiny silver. The only superpower associated with that, however, is invisibility and a low body temperature. And insanity.
-   _Kamen Rider Drive_ features Kamen Rider Chaser, whose silver suit with purple accents makes him both shinier and darker at the same time than Mach, whose suit is just white.
-   In _Legends of Tomorrow_, Nate Haywood is a historian, who ends up being badly hurt on a mission, and his life is only saved because of a Super Serum, which turns him into a super-strong metal man. He starts calling himself "Steel" since his grandfather was a great World War II hero named "Commander Steel".
-   In _Super Sentai_ and _Power Rangers_, a number of Sixth Rangers set themselves apart from the rest of the team by wearing shiny metallic gold or silver suits. This has become more obvious and more common over the years due to improved costume materials. The Gold Samurai Ranger inspires this reaction:
    
    **Emily:** (dazed) Wow...he's so sparkly!
    
    -   The first one was Mega Silver in _Denji Sentai Megaranger_ and the Silver Space Ranger in _Power Rangers in Space_. (_Power Rangers Zeo_ technically had a "Gold Ranger" first, but while his _theme color_ was gold, his _actual suit_ was mainly black.) A few other silver-colored Rangers would show up in later years.
    -   Starting with _Engine Sentai Go-onger_ and _Power Rangers RPM_, nearly _every_ series has had a Gold Ranger, a Silver Ranger, or both. Only _Ressha Sentai ToQger_ excluded one, and that's because metallic colors didn't fit with the show's Rainbow Motif.

    Music 

-   The Painkiller, from the Judas Priest album of the same name, is a shiny, metallic-skinned Winged Humanoid, said to be "half man and half machine", who rides a dragon-motorcycle with sawblades for wheels, and with an appropriate theme song to fit.
    
    _He! Is! The Painkiller! THIS! IS! THE PAINKILLER!_
    

    Pinballs 

-   The titular character in _The Machine: Bride of Pin\*Bot_ too. Makes sense, considering she's a robot.
-   Though they're not superheroes, everyone in _Silverball Mania_ is shiny, chrome, and naked.
-   Just about everyone remembers the nude chrome Fembot of _Viper_ more than the game itself.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The Silver Centurion, a sample of the Champion class created for _D&D_ 3.5 by Rich Burlew.
    -   Among the Planar Touchstones described in the 3.5E _Planar Handbook_, there are the Life Molds of Neumannus on the Lawful Neutral plane of Mechanus. Those seeking its high-order power pay the resident Inevitables (living constructs) with blood, and in exchange gets placed in a mold modifying their bodies. Afterward, they can cover themselves in a layer of flexible iron that protect them against weapons, fire, and acid, and increase their strength (but lower their dexterity), and also remove any need for breathing.
    -   D&D gorgons aren't the traditional hideous snake-haired women, but large bulls with iron-plated skin and a breath weapon that turns enemies to stone.
-   _Eclipse Phase_ has a form of armor called the Smart Skin, consisting of a layer of Nanomachines that covers the user's body and has the flexibility and texture of skin until it is activated, at which point it becomes rigid and protective. It's described as resembling a layer of liquid mercury.
-   _GURPS_ has the Body of Metal meta-trait which you can either have intrinsically or get via magic. Ultra-Tech has a nanobot suit of armor that makes you more durable, stronger, and faster.
-   _Exalted_ has a spell called Invulnerable Skin of Bronze. It's advised not to go swimming with that in use.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_ has Karn, Silver Golem. A golem made of silver. Becomes a Tin Tyrant later on when possessed by Phyrexia, then goes back to being a Chrome Champion again.
-   _Rifts_ Glitterboys are Powered Armor examples, being Nigh-Invulnerable and having Super-Strength. The brilliant silver armor was originally just a defence against laser weapons, but now that The End of the World as We Know It has come and gone, the shining appearance has made them symbols of hope for humanity in the time After the End.
-   _Shadowrun_ has the nova-hot SimSense megastar Mariah Mercurial, who sports implanted sheaths of shiny metal on her body.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_ also has this, one of the mutations that a Champion of Chaos can get is the metal body. All of your flesh is turned into metal and you receive some really nice bonuses to toughness and strength as a result. Wizards of the Gold school also have a ritual that can turn your body into shiny, solid gold. Current leader and champion of the wizard orders, Balthazar Gelt has done this.
-   In _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_, the Glass Walkers have the gift Steel Fur, which gives them an armor bonus while slightly reducing their dexterity.

    Video Games 

-   The "Iron Flesh" pyromancy in _Dark Souls_ temporarily turns the player character into one of these, sacrificing mobility for a considerable boost to defense and poise.
-   _Divinity: Original Sin II_: The Polymorph skill "Heart of Steel" gives the user a short-lived coating of liquid metal, granting their physical Armor Points a boost that regenerates each turn.
-   The Bronze Colossus of _Dwarf Fortress_ is often depicted as this.
-   _Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth_: The Crystal Dragon, which serves as the boss of the fourth stratum (Lucent Hollows), is a draconic being with a skin made of hard white ore. During battle, it is capable of deploying its crystalline wings to gain resistance against elemental attacks at the cost of being weaker against melee ones, and viceversa when the wings are retracted.
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Star Resistance_: Metal Giga, the giant Star Lore Superstar who appears in the first third of Stage 4 to defeat Stone Mack. As his name implies, he isn't merely gigantic but covered in metal skin.
-   _Flying Dragon_ for the Nintendo 64 featured metallized versions of the playable characters as sub-bosses.
-   _Halo 5: Guardians_ has the silver-colored "Ultra" line of Covenant vehicles, the members of which have very strong armor and explosive primary weapons.
-   The Wheel of Fate from _House of the Dead 3_.
-   _Kirby_:
    -   When he reappears as the fourth boss of _Kirby and the Rainbow Curse_, Whispy Woods is covered in shiny silver metal that renders him completely invincible to Kirby's basic attacks. To defeat him, Kirby needs to collect enough stars to charge up the only thing that can actually hurt him: a super-powered Star Dash.
    -   As a reference to _Rainbow Curse_, Whispy Woods uses this technique again in _Kirby: Revenge of Dream Land_. Since the Star Dash doesn't exist in this game, Kirby needs to attack the thorny pods that appear at several points in the arena, which count as a part of Whispy himself and will eventually break the tree's armor down once they take enough hits.
-   Fi from _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_ is one, which fits with her being the spirit of the Goddess/Master Sword. Same goes for Ghirahim, her Evil Counterpart, in his One-Winged Angel form.
-   Galactus randomly appoints two of the main villains (Wesker, Akuma, Dormammu, or Doctor Doom) as his heralds for his Boss Battle in _Marvel vs. Capcom 3_. All 4 characters take on a shiny metallic appearance, mimicking the Silver Surfer. The Heroes & Heralds mode in _Ultimate_ allows everyone else to take on the same appearance. This is unusual because, in the comics, Galactus has had numerous other heralds who didn't actually change in appearance or take on a form similar to Silver Surfer's, so the trope is applied to the game because it's an easy way to show that a character has become a herald.
-   _Monster Hunter_:
    -   _Monster Hunter 2 (dos)_: Kushala Daora is an Elder Dragon notable for its silvery metallic body. Its scales and skin are made of a unique organic metal that rusts over time, requiring the dragon to shed them periodically. The highly-aggressive Rusted Kushala Daora, introduced in this same game, is a variant that has yet to molt, giving it a suitably weathered brown look.
    -   _Monster Hunter Portable 3rd_: The subspecies Steel Uragaan has a metallic carapace instead of a rocky one like the standard Uragaan. It is theorized by the Guild that this is the result of the monster feeding on metallic ore instead of rocks. The reactivity of this carapace allows Steel Uragaan to unleash a fetid gas during battle, which upon contact prevents a hunter from using items (except for the Cleanser to remove the ailment).
-   In _Neverwinter Nights_, one possible color for both your character's skin and for armor or helms is "mirror". Unfortunately for the player, the effect is purely visual. However, there is a "camouflage" spell that has the same visual effect and provides concealment.
-   Holy Champions in _Nexus Clash_ can transform into solid steel, granting them Super-Strength and Nigh-Invulnerability. In one version of the game, they were so strong that they could wield telephone poles and throw cars, though their powers have been channeled into Good Old Fisticuffs more recently.
-   _Pac-Man World_: Pac-Man when he has the Chrome Power-Up.
-   _Pokémon_: Some Pokémon of the Steel type, such as Steelix, Scizor, and Jirachi.
-   The main character in _Rise of the Robots_ is a Cyborg that appears in the shape of a human, made out of shiny metal.
-   _Street Fighter_ series:
    -   Seth from _Street Fighter IV_.
    -   Urien from _Street Fighter III_, who covers himself in liquid metal when fighting and makes metallic _clong_s when struck. He is a Tin Tyrant; his powers and machinations are geared largely towards destruction, unlike his brother, Gill.
-   The second _Soulcalibur_ game (_Soul Calibur 1_) has unlockable chrome skins of all the characters.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   Mario is able to turn into Metal Mario upon wearing a Metal Cap _Super Mario 64_, which temporarily renders him invincible and allows him to walk underwater. _Super Mario 64 DS_ re-assigns this as Wario's power upon collecting a Power Flower.
    -   In _New Super Mario Bros. 2_, Mario and Luigi are able to turn into Gold Mario and Silver Luigi upon collecting a Gold Flower, and allows them to shoot golden fireballs that turn bricks into coins.
    -   Metal Mario later appears in several spinoffs as a separate character from regular Mario, including the _Mario Golf_ and _Mario Kart_ series. Peach later gets her own metallic counterpart in _Mario Kart 8_ in the form of Pink Gold Peach.
-   _Super Smash Bros._:
    -   Metal Mario makes a reappearance during the 1P Game in _Super Smash Bros. 64_. His moveset is identical to his regular counterpart, only he's heavier and more durable. He reappears in Adventure Mode in _Super Smash Bros. Melee_ (with a Metal Luigi joining in to help Metal Mario if Luigi is unlocked) and as the final boss of Bowser's classic mode in _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_.
    -   _Super Smash Bros. Melee_ also introduces the Metal Box as an item, which will temporarily turn any character who picks it up into a metal version of themselves. Like with Metal Mario above, characters in a metal state are heavier and take less knockback.
-   Dural from _Virtua Fighter_.

    Web Animation 

-   _Meta Runner:_ The final episode has Tari acquiring a metallic skin from Sofia during her fight with Lucinia, allowing her to withstand a lot more damage than what she normally can (as well as giving her voice a slight robotic reverberation akin to Metal Mario). It doesn’t last very long, however.

    Webcomics 

-   Scale, the heroine of _Cameo Comic_, received a wristband from the Magitek world of _Magical Misfits_, that can cover her body with an armor of liquid metal, as well as growing blades over her arms, T-1000-style.
-   "Largous" in the _Dragon Tails_ superhero arc has the power to turn his body into an indestructible metal. It...isn't as good as it sounds.
-   Tempts Fate from _Goblins_ has a belt that covers him with invincible, Colossus-style armor whenever he's jumping or falling.
-   Maxima from _Grrl Power_ is made of some kind of golden metal. All she'll say is that 1: It's not actually gold, and 2: It's classified. Though apparently no one knows what it is anyway, so it's kind of moot. A flashback shows her metal skin started to develop after she broke open a geode and was soaked in the unidentified fluid inside.
-   Villainous example: _Sluggy Freelance_'s Crushestro and his wife Chestro.

    Web Original 

-   In _Darwin's Soldiers_, Gustave injects himself with a Super Serum that infuses his bones, claws, and teeth with metal in addition to granting him metallic skin.
-   _Whateley Universe_:
    -   Mirror is a telekinetic brick, but his skintight energy field reflects light, giving him a chromed appearance. Unfortunately, he can't turn it off.
    -   Silver Ghost has a similar effect when using her force field.
    -   Pearlescent is also similar, but her PK field appears nacreous (like a pearl), hence her code name. Like Silver Ghost, she can control it.
    -   Dr Langston, who is the former superhero Tin Man, has chrome-like skin which he covers with spray-on latex when in public.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: Toph Beifong, like many strong earthbenders, can encase herself in a stone bodysuit for defense. After she invents metalbending, she pulls off the same trick with what was previously a metal blast door. And then kicks the asses of the firebenders on the other side of the door.
-   _Ben 10: Alien Force_: Kevin Levin, who's part Osmosian, can become this by absorbing metal to give himself protection or to create a weapon with his hands.
-   _Infinity Train_: This is literally what MT, and by extension, all of the other reflections are when they go out of mirrors.
-   _Star Wars Resistance_: Commander Pyre, subordinate to the above-mentioned Captain Phasma, has a set of shiny golden armour to contrast with his boss' silver.
-   _The Transformers_ managed to do this to Optimus Prime, already a 50-foot robot, by coating him with Unobtainium making him the sole being in the universe immune to the Hate Plague.
-   _Xavier: Renegade Angel_: The episode "Chief Beef Loco" features Shiny, a drug dealer so rich that he was able to "\[have\] every cell in his body platinumed."
