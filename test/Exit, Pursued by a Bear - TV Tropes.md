_"Exit, pursued by a bear."_

When the bad guy is finished off by a large, vicious animal.

This is a method to keep the hero's hands clean while still dispatching the villain. The difference is that that trope is more removing an obstacle without losing karma for the heroes. Often, the death happens entirely off-screen, with the villain's gruesome mauling being implied instead of shown, though sometimes you will hear sounds or see a silhouette of the carnage. If the work doesn't allow death, or if killing simply goes against the tone of the story, they may simply be Chased Off into the Sunset or non-fatally mauled by the beast. Of course in such cases, Fridge Logic may set in about their actual odds of escape/survival.

This can also be used to easily bring the villain Back from the Dead, since really, did you think a mere bear would stop him?

Despite mostly dealing with death, this trope can be used in a non-lethal (and comedic) way, being the final part of a villain's Humiliation Conga, where following their defeat by the hero, they are forced to run for their lives while being chased by an animal over the horizon and out of sight, possibly never to be seen again.

Though it doesn't have to be a literal bear, it often is, since Bears Are Bad News. If it's another creature rather than an outright villain that gets chased away by the bear, it's because there's Always a Bigger Fish. If the heroes called the bear here themselves, then it's Summon Bigger Fish. If it was the villain's own mistreated pet doing the mauling, that's a case of The Dog Bites Back. The hapless character may also simply take a fall into the Shark Pool or the Snake Pit.

Inverse of Villain: Exit, Stage Left. Compare We Will Meet Again, and see also Just Desserts if the animal is shown actually eating them. If the individual doing the chasing is also an established villain, see Bad Guys Do the Dirty Work. May invoke Offscreen Inertia. Compare Chased Off into the Sunset, in which the pursuer is another person rather than an animal. This sometimes overlaps with Uncertain Doom in cases where it's not clear whether the beast actually succeeds in killing the bad guy.

Related to Disney Villain Death, which serves a similar 'kill the villain without the hero doing it' purpose. If the hero (or villain) _does_ do it directly, that may be Fed to the Beast.

Invoked by the episode of the same name of _Shakespeare & Hathaway - Private Investigators_.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Doraemon: Nobita and the Island of Miracles ~Animal Adventure~_ have the villain, Sherman, who's the leader of a group of futuristic poachers who enslaved assorted wildlife, being thrown from his exploding beetle mecha and into a herd of pissed-off wild animals, including moas, saber-toothed tigers, wooly rhinoceroses, and other prehistoric animals. Cue Sherman running like crazy as a dozen of his formerly-enslaved animals give chase.
-   Dante, the Big Bad of _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_, is last seen being chased into an elevator by the now-mindless, ravenous Gluttony.
-   Ms. Goldenweek in the manga of _One Piece_ was last seen being pounced on by Karoo, a giant riding duck, and not seen again until about 250 chapters later in a mini-arc.
-   In _Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon_, Team Rocket has switched from Blasting Off Again into a Twinkle in the Sky to being "rescued" by a Bewear Once per Episode. The Bewear likes them, but doesn't know its own strength and terrifies them.
-   In _Princess Mononoke_, Eboshi is finally taken out by the decapitated head of the giant wolf spirit she just fatally shot. While she survives having her entire arm bitten off, she won't be using any of the guns her factory produced again.
-   This is implied at the conclusion of the _Sherlock Hound_ episode, "The Adventure of the Three Students". Moriarty and his men flee across Loch Ness, only for a familiar shape to appear under the water. This is lampshaded when Moriarty senses that they're being followed.

    Asian Animation 

-   _Happy Heroes_: At the end of episode 10, the bear which was going after Big M.'s bread comes back, this time going after some fish he has stolen from the heroes.
-   The _Lamput_ episode "Skinny Monster" ends with a bear getting angry at the docs for bothering him and chasing them into the distance.

    Comic Books 

-   The graphic novel _La Débauche_. The fact that it is set in a zoo provides a convenient tiger.
-   Doctor Doom once got assaulted by his own attack dogs, because he got in the way of a fox and then, long long long story, because Doom was fighting a Batman Expy he'd lost part of his armor, so he instead fell off a cliff.
-   At the end of _Hack/Slash vs. Chuckie_, Chuckie gets swallowed whole by an alligator while battling Cassie in a swamp.
-   In _Tank Vixens_, Udda and Hilda are last seen pursued by a headsman on a medieval-themed world. It is implied that they may survive, however.

    Fan Works 

-   _The Bolt Chronicles_: A comedic version of this trope is seen in "The Cakes," the ending of which depicts the pastry-covered Bolt, Mittens, and Rhino dashing for the doggy door with Penny's angry mom in hot pursuit.
-   _Rise of the Galeforces_: The events of the last few chapters see each of this mega-crossover's two villains meet their fate in this manner: Velociripper gets Swallowed Whole by a Cyborg mosasaur that was a recurring antagonist, while a ludicrously Out of Character Peter Ludlow is ripped to pieces, _onscreen_, by the baby _T. rexes_ from _Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs_, of all things. Some years after the fic's writing, its own author followed up on his criticism of it in his _Protectors of the Plot Continuum_ missions by having Velociripper be unwittingly sent to the PPC Headquarters alongside the mosasaur that'd eaten him up and then recovered in critical condition (setting up his Heel–Face Turn later), on the grounds that there was a lot of potential with the character which he'd unfortunately squandered at the time. The character replacement of Ludlow, of course, had no such luck.

    Films — Animated 

-   In _All Dogs Go to Heaven_, Carface is chased away by King Gator, whose famous "Big-Lipped Alligator Moment" was a setup for this incident. Next time we see him, he's in Fluffy Cloud Heaven.
-   In _A Bug's Life_, the ants discover that main villain Hopper is afraid of birds, so they build a fake one to try and scare him away. He eventually sees through their ploy; so when Flik and Princess Atta lead him to an ACTUAL bird in the finale, he doesn't realize it's not a trick until it's too late.
-   In _Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2_, Chester V is devoured by the very same Cheespider he demonized and threatened throughout the film.
-   Near the end of _The Great Mouse Detective_, Felicia gets attacked and mauled offscreen by the royal hounds.
-   Captain Gutt in _Ice Age: Continental Drift_ winds up in the gut of a siren-like lungfish creature.
    -   _The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild_: After he loses control of his raptor army to Crash and Eddie, Orson is chased away by his raptors who have been commanded to eat him.
-   Scar in _The Lion King (1994)_ finds his end by the hyenas. Particularly chilling, since most other examples of this trope treats the animal as the vessel for karma, or just a force of nature. But the hyenas that eat Scar were goofy, well-characterized villains like all the other characters earlier in the film, making his death more of a murder than an animal-related fatality. Also, rather than him simply being chased off screen by the hyenas, we instead get to explicitly witness the pack brutally mauling him to death by the shadows cast by the fire on the wall of Pride Rock.
-   Also not killed, but at the end of _Open Season_, ax-crazy evil hunter Shaw is captured, tarred, and feathered by the very animals he's been out to add to his trophy wall. They let him go once they're done with him, and The Stinger sees him get mistaken for Bigfoot by the same couple who was seen hunting for him earlier in the film.
-   While we don’t see what exactly happens to him, in _Over the Hedge_, Dwayne tries to flee police after one of his traps causes massive damage and winds up in the yard of Nugent the dog, who decides to play with him. Because Nugent doesn’t quite understand his own strength, whatever happens to Dwayne isn’t pleasant.
-   Captain Hook, from Disney's original film of _Peter Pan_, exits pursued by the Crocodile (as pictured above). Depending on which sequel you go by (the animated sequel or _Hook_), it may have gone badly for _the Crocodile_.
    -   If you go by the animated sequel (_Return To Never Land_), this happens again when an octopus sees Hook and _his entire crew_ as codfish, and pursues them all.
    -   The trend continues in _Kingdom Hearts_; after his boss fights in the first game and Ven's story in _Birth by Sleep_, the Crocodile chases him across the water, and in Terra and Aqua's stories in the latter game, he's scared off from ever being a boss by the same beast.
-   Big Boss in _Rio 2_ gets swallowed by a boa constrictor.
-   While not exactly a villain, the last we see of Mike in _Sing_ is him driving away in his car with an angry bear hanging on to the back.
-   Invoked in _South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut_, where Saddam Hussein is mentioned to have been killed by a pack of wild boars (just to clear things up, the movie came out 5 years before the invasion of Iraq).
-   No, he doesn't die, but Plankton exits _The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water_ pursued by Gary.
-   Botticelli from _The Tale of Despereaux_ is ultimately done in by his own pet cat.
-   In _The Thief and the Cobbler_, Zig Zag is eaten by crocodiles and by his own pet vulture Phido.
-   At the end of _Watership Down_, the heroes successfully bait someone's pet dog towards their warren, which is under siege from the forces of General Woundwort. Everyone who can run fast enough immediately becomes an example... Except for Woundwort himself, whose last known act is to try and fight the dog single-handed. They Never Found the Body afterwards, and at least some of the survivors continue to believe he made his escape, but either way his act of Villainous Valour probably saved a lot of lives.
-   Subverted in _Wreck-It Ralph_, where the villainous King Candy/Turbo gets devoured by a Cy-Bug. As Cy-Bugs become what they eat, the villain assimilates with the Cy-Bug and goes One-Winged Angel on Ralph before being Killed Off for Real in a volcanic Mentos/Cola eruption that Ralph causes to wipe out the bugs.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The climax from _Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls_ seems to imply the villain is not so much pursued by the gorilla as _pursued_ by it.
-   In the Nicolas Cage/Samuel L. Jackson film _Amos & Andrew_, the bloodhounds from earlier in the movie go chasing after the police chief near the end.
-   _Anna and the Apocalypse_: Most of the background characters from _Turning my Life Around_ are last seen running off-screen with zombies ambling in pursuit.

-   The third act of _Cabin In The Woods_ culminates in Dana and Marty releasing all of the Organization's monsters, resulting a _very_ bloody finale as they slaughter everything in the building.
-   At the end of _City of Ember_, Mayor Cole is eaten by a giant mole.
-   In another Van Damme movie, _Double Team_, the villain is stuck on a land mine, and finds himself facing a tiger. No way to survive, he steps off the mine as it pounces on him.

-   _James Bond_:
    -   In _The Spy Who Loved Me_ henchman Jaws falls into a tank with a shark. They both go under and blood is soon seen floating to the surface. After the villain's lair is sunk into the sea, Jaws surfaces and swims off, reappearing in the next film.
    -   In _Skyfall_, one of the Elite Mooks threatening Bond in the casino is taken down by a Komodo dragon.
-   _Jurassic Park_: This is the franchise's favourite way to dispose of villains to the point it's basically a Once per Episode deal (with the exception of the third film, because there's no human villains in it). If there's some nasty character, it's a _very_ good bet they'll be killed by a dinosaur near the end.
    -   The first film ends with the raptors getting eaten by the _T. rex_ from earlier in the movie. Nedry, who causes the park sabotage, is also killed and eaten by a _Dilophosaurus_ after he accidentally crashes his car into its enclosure.
    -   The main villain in the sequel is ultimately devoured by a baby _T. rex_, but not before first having his leg broken by the baby's father to soften him up for the kill.
    -   The _Indominus rex_ in _Jurassic World_ is finished off by the _Mosasaurus_ dragging her into its tank, and Hoskins (the human antagonist) is cornered and devoured by Delta the _Velociraptor_.
    -   _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_: The _Indoraptor_ corners Ken Wheatley in its cage and mauls him to death, then chases Gunnar Eversoll into an elevator, whereupon the scene fades out and we're treated to an instance of Sound-Only Death. Later, Ely Mills is torn in half and devoured by a _T. rex_ and a _Carnotaurus_.
    -   Near the end of _Jurassic World Dominion_, Dodgson is cornered, spat on, and killed by a pack of _Dilophosaurus_. Earlier in the film, Delacourt, the guy who kidnaps Maisie and Beta, is killed when a juvenile _Baryonyx_ rips his face off.
-   _Shaft_ knockoff _A Low Down Dirty Shame_ has one mook being cornered & mauled by a pair of Rottweilers that the protagonist sics on him.
-   In _The Naked Gun 2 1/2_, Robert Goulet's character survives a fall from a building unscathed, only to be mauled by a lion seconds later as a result of Frank accidentally letting some animals escape from the zoo earlier in the film.
-   Employed twice via tiger in _Welcome to the Jungle_ against Jean-Claude Van Damme's character, although he's more morally bankrupt than a villain, and even helps the protagonists. He's then teased with Phil, the film's actual villain, at the end.
-   The literal phrase was used by the young high school gang when they left in _The World's End_, but morphed into "Let's Boo Boo!"
    
    **Gary:** If we needed to make a quick getaway, we'd say: "Exit, Pursued by a Bear". And then, it was: "Exit, Pursued by Yogi Bear". And then, it was just: "Let's Yogi and Boo-Boo". And then: "Let's Boo-Boo".
    
-   Leopold, resident Jerkass and Butt-Monkey is eventually chased down by Harry the tiger near the end of _The Worlds Greatest Athlete_.

    Literature 

-   _Airborn_: Szpirglas, the infamous Sky Pirate, is killed by a pride of the huge, flying, predatory felines aptly named cloud cats. Interestingly, despite several attempts to do so, the cloud cats never seriously injure any of the good guys.
-   _The Cat Who... Series_: In book #18 (_The Cat Who Said Cheese_), an abusive ex-husband tracks his ex-wife to Moose County, using the fact that back in the navy he saved a shipmate's life (said shipmate still suffered brain damage) as leverage to coerce the local, now a beekeeper, into becoming an accessory to the bombing of said frightened ex's hotel room. When he comes back to try and cover his tracks and finish the job — the intended target was out and about but someone else died — the beekeeper inadvertently gives him a wool blanket and the bees swarm the murderer, who is found dead the next morning.
-   _Chronicles of Ancient Darkness_: Tenris, the main antagonist of _Spirit Walker_, is dragged underwater by an orca whale for killing its young kin.
-   _The Chronicles of Prydain_: The villainous bandit Dorath is torn apart by wolves just as he's about to "remove the charms" of the princess Eilonwy.

-   In the Sister Mary Helen mystery _Death of an Angel_, the B plot covers an alumna's plan to murder her domineering, abusive mother. Her plan for disposing of the body is to underfeed her mother's standard poodles, and then set them on the dead body so that there will be nothing to implicate her. However, in the confrontation, Mama injures her face. Then the rapist-murderer from the A plot invades the house, and then the two nuns who are the amateur sleuths in the series arrive, as do the police. The rapist is stopped but then dogs come from the basement and smell the blood on Angelica's face and attack her. Inspector Gallegher shoots them dead, but Angelica is mortally wounded and succumbs to her injuries the next morning.
-   _The Divine Comedy_: A thief in Hell curses God and gives the finger to the sky, only to be attacked by snakes so severely that he has to shut up and exit the story as a whole.
-   _Doc Savage_: In _Fortress of Solitude_, the escaping John Sunlight is followed to a point where his tracks meet those of a polar bear next to an open lead in the ice. Since there's a lot of blood and no tracks leading away, they draw the obvious (and incorrect) conclusion.
-   _Gods and Warriors_:
    -   In _Eye of the Falcon_, Kreon is gored through the chest and trampled to death by the guardian bull of the House of the Goddess.
    -   In _The Crocodile Tomb_, Alekto falls into the Nile and is killed by crocodiles that are drawn by the spell Pirra tricked her to keep as an amulet.
-   _Goldilocks and the Three Bears_ is a famous case: the titular little girl breaks into the three bears' house, helps herself to their porridge, breaks the Baby Bear's chair, then takes a nap in their beds... from which she's rudely awakened when the three bears return from their walk, not at all happy about their property being disrespected by an impudent human. What happens next varies from telling to telling, but most commonly, she jumps out the window and never comes back again.
-   _Grailblazers_: The ghost of Shakespeare himself appears and invokes this trope. As a literal ghost writer for the British soap _Coronation Street_, he ends one scene in his script with "Exit Ken Barlow, pursued by a bear."
-   _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_: At the end, Umbridge is captured and carried away by a herd of centaurs. Dumbledore somehow persuades them to let her go between chapters, and she turns up in the hospital wing relatively unharmed, though she jumps if someone mimics the sound of hooves. (What exactly happened to her while in their custody is never revealed, though the usual suspects put forward their own theories.) When she tries to sneak out of the castle, Peeves catches on and she ends up exiting, Pursued by a Poltergeist with a Walking Stick.
-   _Judge Dee_: _The Haunted Monastery_ ends like this, involving an actual bear. After the man behind several murders of women affably points out that he is untouchable due to the lack of evidence and his connections in the Imperial Court, Dee agrees with his assessment, then lures him into a courtyard being used to exercise a savage bear owned by a visiting theatre troupe, that can only be controlled by his master. Dee says he will leave the villain's fate in the hands of Heaven. If the bear's owner hears his screams and comes in time to rescue him...well, he doesn't.
-   _Live and Let Die_: Mr. Big tries to feed James Bond and Solitaire to sharks and barracudas, by dragging them behind his boat. However, the bomb Bond had planted in the boat detonates, and Mr. Big falls in the water, to be eaten by the sharks and barracudas himself.

-   _Redwall_: In _Mariel Of Redwall_, Gabool falls into the pit where he keeps his pet scorpion.
-   _The Reynard Cycle_:
    -   This happens to an _entire army_ in _The Baron of Maleperduys_, though replace "bear" with "terrifying wolf monsters."
    -   In _Defender of the Crown_, Acteon is dispatched by an enormous cat Chimera. And it was his Chimera.
-   _Shannara_: In _The Druid of Shannara_, Psycho for Hire Pe Ell is killed by the Koden, a gigantic bear. It's implied to have been set up by the King of the Silver River, as revenge for the death of his daughter. In _High Druid of Shannara_, the Shapeshifting Moric is last seen lying on the ground as an actual Dragon approaches it. Meta-irony much?
-   _Sharpe_: Subverted. Sharpe leaves his enemy Obadiah Hakeswill to be killed by beasts several times, but it never works. The man-eating tigers were recently fed, the executioner elephant didn't get the right command, etc. This all feeds Hakeswill's conviction that he cannot die.

-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: The loathsome Ser Amory meets his end when his captors throw him, naked and unarmed, into a pit with a starving bear.
-   _The Space Trilogy_: Happens in _That Hideous Strength_ with Mr Bultitude, an actual bear.

    -   In "The Pack", the evil zookeeper ends up being eaten by hyenas after Buffy hurls him into the hyena pit. Knowing her, she probably didn't mean for him to end up _in_ the pit, but she doesn't shed any tears about it later.

    -   A stage show by _Ishmael Skyes_, playing one of Shakespeare's actors, narrated an incident where he couldn't see out of the bear costume, leading to the memorable line:

Who then chases you offscreen as the credits roll.
-   An In-Universe example can be found in a fairy tale book in _Drakensang_: in the tale, a jerkass kraken keeps all the treasure from a sunken ship for himself, and won't share it with his friends.

-   _Solar Opposites_ has a morbidly hilarious inversion in an episode where the titular family creates a pet dinosaur that turns out to be fully sentient, speech-capable, and Evil All Along. When they finally realize the threat he presents, they deal with him by luring him into a natural history museum that they visited earlier, whereupon he meets his end at the hands of the dinosaur-bone-obsessed palaeontologists working there.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_:
    -   Happens to SpongeBob and Patrick chased by a jellyfish in "Jellyfishing".

    -   Happens to Squidward with an angry guard worm in "The Lost Mattress".
-   _Total Drama All-Stars_: Heather and Alejandro's last scene is them frantically swimming away from Fang, the man-eating mutant shark that Mike had sicced on them earlier.
-   _Transformers: Prime_: Starscream is last seen at the end of the Finale Movie, _Predacons Rising_, being pursued by Predacons Skylynx and Darksteel. Unfortunately, the sequel series shows that he survived out of sheer luck after finding a weapons cache while fleeing from his Predacon pursuers.
-   The _VeggieTales_ Silly Song "The Yodeling Veterinarian of the Alps" literally has a bear chasing the titular character (played by Larry) off the stage at the end. Because yodeling to him didn't cure the bear traps on his paws.
-   In _Voltron: Legendary Defender_, Keith and Krolia deal with Commander Trugg by tricking her into opening a cell containing a feral Robeast. We don't _see_ what it does to her and her henchmen, but the noises we hear make it obvious they won't survive the experience.
-   One _Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?_ episode has Zack and Ivy chased by jaguars in a Mayan temple before running into VILE henchmen. The bad guys ended up at the bottom of a pit with the jaguars drawing near.
