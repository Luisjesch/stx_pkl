**Abe Sapien:** Behind this door — a dark entity, evil, ancient, and hungry.  
**Hellboy:** Oh, well. Let me go in and say "hi."

So you're being attacked by The Legions of Hell. They're enslaving your innocents, terrorizing the citizens, and generally wreaking havoc.

Who You Gonna Call? This guy.

Experienced and equipped with Implausible Fencing Powers, Improbable Aiming Skills (probably with Depleted Phlebotinum Shells), some flavor of magic, demolitions expertise, or all of the above, this character tends to be Weak, but Skilled—relative to their prey, that is. They can come in several varieties (not necessarily mutually exclusive), including:

-   A Hunter who hunts down and kills demons for revenge or other personal reasons.
-   A Chosen One who kills demons because of destiny.
-   A Demon or Half-Demon Hunter of Their Own Kind.
-   Someone who made a Deal with the Devil and has decided to pull a Faustian Rebellion.
-   A protector of the helpless.
-   Someone only interested in money who thus offers their services for a price.
-   A Church Militant, Warrior Monk, Paladin, or the like on a Mission from God who uses a cross or holy water (among other assorted Holy Hand Grenades) to exorcise their enemy.
-   A descendant/member of a family or clan dedicated to fighting them.
-   Someone whose job description doesn't include Demon Slaying, but finds themselves having to step up and kick demon ass anyway.

They're frequently also an Occult Detective or some kind of mercenary.

How Demon Slayers generally operate and go about their business (as well as whether or not they are even justified in doing this or are committing Van Helsing Hate Crimes) depends a great deal upon what form demons generally take in the setting in question. Some keep a Masquerade, hiding the existence of Hell and its denizens from outsiders, while others prefer a more open and direct approach. Also keep in mind that He Who Fights Monsters is at risk of happening here.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The Shinmeiryu in the Akamatsu\-verse (used by Setsuna and Motoko) is a demon-slaying sword style. Within the _Negima_ series is also Mana Tatsumiya, who fits into both the mercenary _and_ priestess type (yep - a price on spirituality). Setsuna's job as a demon slayer is rather ironic, though, considering she's half crow demon herself. Mana is also half demon, making her a half-demon mercenary priestess.
-   Guts in _Berserk_. As the Black Swordsman, his role fits squarely into the vengeful hunter mode, thanks to him being madder than hell about the events of the Eclipse, and the actions of Griffith in particular. Eventually, he stops actively seeking out Apostles to kill in order to focus on healing Casca's insanity, but still runs into them, largely because of the Brands of Sacrifice borne by both of them.
-   _Blue Exorcist_ is basically this, only with exorcists. Most of them fall under a job or family business, with a few for personal reasons. Rin falls under personal reasons and Hunter of His Own Kind due to his Half-Human Hybrid status. He's not the only one there, as it's mentioned that there are _other_ half-demons out there who work as exorcists.
    -   Judging by what we know from Rin, the half-demons serving as Exorcists or otherwise getting involved in the war against demons isn't far-fetched; they naturally can see demons, due to their bloodline, while others have to have a masho (spirit wound) inflicted to see them.
-   _Chainsaw Man_: Denji, the protagonist, starts off as a devil hunter to pay off his debts, but ends up being taken in by the government's agency dedicated to such a task. In fact, Devil hunting seems to be a booming international industry, with both public organizations and private freelancers working to hunt devils, with regulations preventing interferences between devil hunters.
-   The titular characters in _Claymore_ are an entire organization that exists purely to hunt down and destroy demons preying on humanity, provided the side that's being preyed on requests their aid and pays an adequate fee afterwards. If they don't...
    -   It's only made worse that the central organization of the Claymores are the ones creating the demons as _an experimental weapon_.
    -   The Claymores are actually part of a centuries long project to create the ultimate dragon slayers.
-   In _Dark Cat_, the two lead brothers Ryoi and Hyoi hunt creatures made of evil while trying to discover their own fate.
-   Not surprisingly, _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_ features this. The "demons" in question are actually Oni (and they're referred to as such in Japanese), while being portrayed as having a lot in common with vampires—violent, bloodthirsty, having super-strength and super-healing (but also extreme vulnerability to sunlight) who wander around killing indiscriminately, sometimes converting victims with their corrupted blood. A secretive organization of hunters use their technically-not-superhuman sword skills to keep the demon population under control. An unidentified demon massacres main character Tanjiro's family and converts his sister Nezuko, but she retains some of her humanity, so he sets out to become a demon-slayer both for revenge and to find a way to cure her.
-   _Devil Hunter Yohko_. Three guesses what it's about.
-   _D.Gray-Man_'s baddies are called akuma, which normally gets translated into "demons". So yep, the series is pretty much this.
-   This pops up occasionally in _Dog Days_, although demon _sealing_ is far more common since demons are normally spirits who have been corrupted and need to be slowly purified. It's also revealed in the third season that the primary purpose behind the Friendly Wars is to make sure that the various kingdoms always have an army ready in the event of a massive demon attack.
-   _Dororon Enma-kun_. Technically, Enma isn't supposed to slay the demons he fights (only capture them), but he doesn't care.
-   _Fairy Tail_: After the Dragon Slayers and the God Slayers, we learn of a new type, Demon Slayers (Devil Slayers in Japanese), which functions mostly the same way, except against demons. The only drawback is that those who use this magic too much will end up losing their minds and humanity, becoming no different from the demons they hunt. Ironically enough, the first known user of this type of magic happens to be a member of a guild composed almost entirely of demons. Though it turns out he didn't exactly join them of his own free will, what with being a reanimated corpse brought back by one of them For Science!, and he always intended to try and destroy them from within alongside himself due to his hatred for them killing his friends and loved ones. When he learns that one of his loved ones (i.e. his son and major character Gray Fullbuster) is still alive, he goes the Suicide by Cop route and passes on the magic to him. Gray in turn becomes obsessed with destroying demons for ruining his life and killing so many of his loved ones, which becomes a bit of a problem when it turns out that the biggest, baddest demon of them all is his best friend and rival Natsu Dragneel.
-   _Inuyasha_:
    -   Sango, and her entire village, specialize in demon (what the English localizations call Youkai) slaying. They fit into the demonic protector and mercenary type, using entirely physical methods, such as weapons (generally made _from_ demons) and poison.
    -   Itinerant monks like Miroku, as well as shrine maidens and priestesses like Kikyo and Kaede, also perform a good number of exorcisms, which may range from waving ofuda at an incorporeal spirit to beating monsters with a ceremonial staff.
-   In _Isuca_, it has been the Shimazu's family job to capture and seal away monsters. They have been doing it since the Kamakura period.
-   Members of the Hachioji Clan of _Jiu Jiu_ have been hunting down and killing rogue demons (and other supernatural creatures that prey on humans) for generations. In the present day, there's a secretive government office that sends assignments and cleans up after their battles. Current clan Heir Takamichi caries on her family's work with two half-demon "werewolves" assisting her during hunts (at least when they aren't begging for treats or trying to convince her to take them on a walk).
-   March's job in _March Story_ is to hunt the Ill, demons that possess ordinary objects and through them, anyone who touches them. If an Ill kills someone while in your body, it's there for good.
-   _Makaryuudo Demon Hunter_'s title character Yama does this as part of her Hell punishment.
-   The Demon Hunter Organization, the Nanaya clan, and (to a degree) The Church in the _Nasuverse_.
-   _Phantom Quest Corp._ is a for-profit organization, lead by Ayaka Kisaragi, which specializes in the occult and the paranormal. She and U Division's Detective Karino track down all manner of spooks across Tokyo and take 'em out.
-   The new magical girl system in _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ changes into this.
-   _Tetragrammaton Labyrinth_ has the Organisation, which was created several hundred years ago by one of the main characters to fight demons.
-   _Ushio and Tora_: the Kouhamei sect seems to be the Church Militant type, with its objectives being both the spread of the words of Buddha and hunting and sealing dangerous Youkai. A solitary mercenary example is Hyo, a taoist equipped with paper tags and roped darts who's looking for the demon who ate his family and took his eye... while slaying all those hostile demons he encounters, especially if harmed a children.
-   _YuYu Hakusho_: The job of the Spirit Detective.
-   _Zombie Land Saga_: The Sagako Busters were a group of demon hunters from The '80s, lead by a living _Tae Yamada_.

    Comic Books 

-   _Artemis: Requiem_ sees the titular character team up with an organization of demon hunters known as the Hellenders. She returns to _Wonder Woman (1987)_ on a mission to kill Etrigan, unaware her organization has been mislead about him as part of a plot by Neron to kill Diana.
-   Devil-Slayer, a member of _The Defenders_, is the Faustian Rebellion type. Eric Payne was a an ex-soldier turned hitman. He was recruited by the hybrid demon-woman Vera Gemini and her Cult of the Harvesters of Eyes, serving as their Reaper of Souls and Agent of Death (assassin). The Cult honed Payne's psychic powers and gave him his Shadow-Cloak, but he quit upon learning that they wished to bring about Xenogenesis, restoring to prominence an ancient demon race that once ruled the Earth. Taking the name "Devil-Slayer," he dedicated himself to fighting demons.
-   John Constantine of _Hellblazer_ from the DC. Not only does he slay demons, but he cons them classically.
-   _Hellboy_, due to his nature as the Anti-Anti-Christ, always has to fight his demonic brethren.
-   Spawn is the Faustian Rebellion writ large, and as such always ends up fighting them sooner or later.

    Fan Works 

-   _Queen of Shadows_ has Yasashi, the last of a long line of Demon Quellers, whose family was specifically targeted for destruction by the Shadowkhan due to their abilities being seen as a threat. As the Sole Survivor of the attack, Yasashi has sworn revenge, and has joined the Shogunate in the Shadows as a means to that end.
-   The raison d'etre behind the existence of N.G.O. Superpower WIC in _The Return_. Though they use the term "Pattern D."
-   The _Jackie Chan Adventures_ fic _The Ultimate Evil_ introduces as one of the Original Characters a demon hunter named Nataline Homato. She's a member of a Japanese family that has been hunting down demons since the days of Medieval Japan, and she's described as Buffy the Vampire Slayer's long lost cousin. She takes interest in the Chan Clan's encounters with the Demon Sorcerers and joins up to help stop them after she attempts to slay the Water Demon Bai Tza. The Demon World part turns her into a Dead Person On Display as a warning against attempting to be a demon slayer in that world, which is now ruled by demons.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Constantine (2005)_, based _ever-so-lightly_ on the _Hellblazer_ comics, the titular character hunts down demonic "halfbreeds" who violate the Balance and sends them back to Hell. In the comic, he's more of a street magician who basically fights anyone who pisses him off or helps people who come to him (if he doesn't laugh them away). See Trenchcoat Brigade.
-   Ash Williams of the _Evil Dead_ universe has the unenviable task of battling demon-possessed undead and not a few demons as well, being that _he_ was the one who accidentally unleashed them upon the world through mishandling of a certain Artifact of Doom.
-   While the _Ghostbusters_ don't target demons _specifically_, preferring "Ghost"-busting and all, they're more than happy to zap-n-trap any demon who makes trouble in NYC.

    Gamebooks 

-   _Fighting Fantasy_:
    -   The book _Dead of Night_ was this trope IN SPADES. The main character is a Demon-Slayer, a Warrior Monk specifically trained to hunt down and destroy the demons of the setting. During the course of the book, he averts a demonic invasion of Gallantria engineered by the Demon Prince Myurr. Virtually every opponent in the book is either a demon or someone working for them. The overall tone of the book is very dark.
    -   This was a recurring trope throughout the series in general, as the reader would be pitted against everything from Fire Demons to Mirror Demons to Hell Demons to Ice Demons at different times.

    Literature 

-   In _A Certain Magical Index_, this trope is referenced by "The One Who Purifies Gods and Slays Demons'', an epithet applied to main character Touma. He has yet to directly fight any demons, let alone kill them, but his magic-negating power would presumably be effective against them. Interestingly, it's implied that the true meaning of this name may not be as a killer of demons. The gods of the setting claim that it represents his ability to understand gods by talking to them. Touma has managed to talk gods into a Heel–Face Turn, raising the possibility that this is how he is intended to defeat demons as well.
-   Colt Regan's first book is titled _Demon Hunter_ for a reason.
-   The Knights of the Cross in _The Dresden Files_ will happily do good and kick evil supernatural butt for their fellow man in general, but their _specific_ mission is to fight against and if possible redeem the members of the Order of the Blackened Denarius — people possessed by literal fallen angels. (It's not entirely clear what the precise relationship between those and other entities more commonly labeled "demons" in the setting may be, but the Fallen seem to be definitely associated with Hell in _some_ form.)
-   In books by Raymond E. Feist, most temples are said to have a 'material' segment of the order, who mostly deal in fighting demons, along with whatever that particular God finds offensive. They tend to be able to hurt demons with mundane weapons, despite others not being able to, and many have traditional demon-banishment spells.
-   Many, many government-employed wych-hunters (despite the name, they hunt gribblies (wych-kin), not witches) in _The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray_, and for most of the reasons above. The protagonist, Thaniel Fox, is also following in his father's footsteps: "the only reason \[his mentor and friend\] Cathaline Bennet needed was that she was odd."
-   The title character of _Magnus_ is a demon slayer. His Flying Brick powers along with immortality makes any demon fighting him suicidal.
-   The Shadowhunters in _The Mortal Instruments_ and _The Infernal Devices_ have this as their job
-   In _The Pardoner's Tale_ the main characters don't slay demons; they have a method that traps demons in inescapable steel pellets. Since the demons don't need to eat, sleep, or excrete, this may actually be worse than death.description.
-   Magical society in _Shaman of the Undead_ has an entire police department, called obviously Department of Possessions and Hauntings, whose striking arm are demon slayers in case a necromancer hunt or exorcism goes awry. Out of characters in-story, Brittle is a prime example, mixing being paid, protecting the helpless and revenge.
-   In _The Silent War_ rare individuals are born with not only special powers for combating the supernatural, but also an inherent urge to do so. The protagonist is the latest one of these, a teenage girl who is greatly relieved to learn that her restlessness, visions and instincts for violence aren't signs of insanity. While there are human sorcerers and undead to deal with, demon-slaying is essentially the day job.
-   Solomon Kane in the Robert E. Howard book series. If he counts, then so do King Kull of Atlantis and Conan of Cimmeria. None of them slay demons as their day job, but have been forced to the task by the circumstances more than once in their careers.
    -   Solomon Kane fights evil in general and is happy to kill bandits and pirates. It's just that he keeps running into supernatural monsters. Conan kills whoever has the most loot.
-   The _Special Circumstances_ unit is occasionally called upon for doing this, as part of their job to battle supernatural villains.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Angel_ was mostly this as well, although he befriended some of the less evil demons. He also slays other vampires.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ is usually, well, a vampire slayer. Vampires in her world are demon possessed corpses. But she's also been fighting other demons since the very first season.
-   The girls from _Charmed_ do a lot of demonslaying during the course of the series.
-   _Dallas_: Implied to have happened in the TV movie sequels (and later the 2012 series, when the sequels were retconned) when J.R. was taunted by a demonic spirit, Adam, to follow through with a planned suicide in the original series' finale, "Condundrum." To wit: J.R. — after having viewed an It’s A Wonderful Life-style alternate reality with Adam (who reveals his true self only at the end) — is hallucinating and sees Adam, clad in a red devil's suit, in the mirror; shortly afterward, Adam screams, "_**DO IT!!!!**_" and there is a gunshot. In the later follow-ups, it is revealed J.R. fired the gun in the mirror, thus killing Adam.
-   Luke Rutherford from _Demons_ is the last descendant of legendary vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing, and thus has to fight vampires and other unholy beings.
-   Makai Knights in _GARO_ are trained from a very young age to hunt down Horrors, demons from the Makai realm. As Horrors prey on the negative karma of humanity, Makai Knights have been necessary for centuries.
-   A few _Kamen Rider_ seasons feature some variation of this, with Wizard hunting Phantoms and Revi and Vice fight actual demons.
-   The _Shadowhunters_ are effectively a human sub-species gifted with angelic blood and paranormal abilities for the purpose of protecting the world from demonic invasion.
-   _Supernatural_. Much of the show's mythology revolves around demons, and it is the job of the Winchester family to kill them. They'll kill plenty of other monsters too however.
-   Some _Super Sentai_ seasons (toned down for the most part in their Power Rangers counterparts) do feature enemies that are of supernatural origin and mainly of the demonic order, with the more recent ones being _Toqger_ and _Ninninger_, with our heroes being of course the slayers.

    Music 

    Pro Wrestling 

-   The Gimmick of Cazador de Demonios in Mexican Wrestling Revolution.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Demon Hunter template from the third edition of _Big Eyes, Small Mouth_ is dedicated to fighting demons, many of which come from the hell dimension of Bazaroth.
-   Demons and devils are among the most powerful enemies that _Dungeons & Dragons_ Player Characters can face, and high-level adventures or certain modules such as _Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus_ will often have PCs heading To Hell and Back, usually to destroy a particularly powerful demon lord such as Orcus.
    -   The Knight of the Chalice is a Prestige Class that is dedicated to fighting demons and devils. Many characters who take this class are some combination of ranger and either cleric or paladin.
    -   Some subclasses are built around the concept, namely Horizon Walker Rangers, Path of the Zealot Barbarians, and Oath of the Watcher Paladins.
    -   The Church of the Silver Flame in _Eberron_ have their entire _religion_ built around this. When they are not a Corrupt Church or Knight Templars, they do this, and they do it fairly well, having developed a few unique tricks like Silver Flame Exorcists and Silver Pyromancers. Aside from evil outsiders, they also hunt undead and lycanthropes (and not all of the latter are really evil, which has earned them a bit of a bad rep among them and their Shifter cousins).
        -   The Druidic Sect of the Gatekeepers have been doing it for longer (not saying much, as the Silver Flame as an independent religion isn't very old), focusing more on Eldritch Abominations from Xoriat than actual demons, however.
        -   The members of The Chamber are also prone to this. However, it's worth noting that the Chamber is an organization composed entirely of _dragons_.
        -   The Giants of Xen'drik also, presumably, had something similar to tackle Quori possession, but since their solution to the Quori problem all but annihilated their own civilization, no one's entirely sure anymore.
    -   Raziel is the most warlike of the Celestial Hebdomad, and is Heaven's most prominent fiend slayer. His Fists, the clerics and paladins who are dedicated to him, are likewise dedicated to kicking infernal and abyssal ass.
-   This is, in theory, what the Wyld Hunt in _Exalted_ is all about. Of course, the dogma of the Immaculate Faith being what it is, their definition of 'demon' includes most typical player characters...
-   In _Pathfinder_, there are several classes that can be tooled specifically for this, such as Rangers, Inquisitors, and Paladins. Of course, any character class can have Demon Slaying as a job as far as roleplay is concerned, but these three classes are highly conducive to the job as far as class mechanics are concerned.
-   Dwarf Daemon Slayers in _Warhammer_. In a twist, Daemon Slayers aren't in it for any greater or more noble purposes beyond the purely personal: if you are a daemon slayer, that means you've already tried to meet your end in glorious battle against trolls and giants...And _failed_. Daemons and Dragons are pretty much all that's left to challenge you, and dragons in the Warhammer setting are rare.
-   The Inquisition of _Warhammer 40,000_ has the Ordo Malleus, an entire branch of investigators dedicated to finding and rooting out daemonic influences. Most of their agents are a mixture of State Sec and holy warrior, but they can also call upon a specialist Space Marine chapter for aid: the Grey Knights. _These_ guys are considered badasses even by other Space Marines, armed and armored with consecrated wargear and protected by formidable psychic powers that make them extremely good at what they do. Even the less experienced ones kick serious ass. The more veteran ones tend to turn up wearing suits of armour that can endure being stomped by a Humongous Mecha, fitted with equipment like flamethrowers that burn souls.
    -   The Tyranids, of all species, have a dedicated daemon-slaying force, identified as Hive Fleet Kronos. Rather than using dedicated anti-psyker weaponry to fight daemons, Hive Fleet Kronos focuses on abnormally-boosting their Shadow in the Warp effect to weaken daemons and other Warp monsters across the entire star system, and then drops Tyranid bioforms specializing in extreme long-ranged attacks. They bomb the crap out of the daemonic hordes from long range rather that fight them in melee where the daemons have the advantage, and once the warp-spawned monsters are destroyed, they consume the rest of the planet.
-   Both the Old and New versions of Worlds of Darkness have Hunters (detailed in _The Reckoning_ and _The Vigil_ respectively), humans with supernatural abilities to fight the PCs from the other games. Groups that specialize on demons:
    -   The Malleus Maleficarum, in addition to other "unholy" beings like vampires and witches.
    -   The Knights of St. Adrian, a private security firm that gets powers from the forces of Heaven.
    -   Utopia Now, libertarian Silicon Valley start-up geniuses out to fight demonically-influenced corporations through a combination of exorcism and hostile buyouts, so that they can build their own Operation Atlantis.
-   _Ars Magica_ has several specialized anti-demon spells. However, although demon-slaying is seen as commendable, the Order of Hermes strongly discourages making a habit of proactively hunting demons, since it risks provoking the wrath of Hell against the Order. (Again.)

    Video Games 

-   The Onikiri from _Akai Ito_ and its sort-of sequel _Aoi Shiro_. But then, their definition of "demons" is very loose...
-   Played with in _Asura's Wrath_. The Gohma heavily resemble Demons and might as well be them for setting and story purposes, and the job of the protagonist and the other Demigods is to fight them. They're not actually Demons or anything like it at all.
-   Inverted in _Bayonetta_ where the title character kills angels instead of demons. Is it ironic that her game, _Ōkami_, and the first _Devil May Cry_ were all made by the same guy, Hideki Kamiya?
    -   Played straight in _Bayonetta 2_ when Gomorrah, one of the demons that Bayonetta uses to finish off angels, turns on her and she has to put him down. She then has to penetrate into the heart of Inferno in order to save Jeanne, who saved her from the aforementioned demon and got Dragged Off to Hell, before her soul is consumed forever.
-   The _Castlevania_ series is the earliest known example in gaming. Each entry has you protecting the people of Transylvania, by battling your way through Count Dracula's legions, to face-off against the Count, himself. Earlier games in the series chronicled the exploits of the Belmont Family, though later games featured all new protagonists and, occasionally, the Count's son, Alucard, siding against his father.
-   Dante of _Dante's Inferno_ is also a demon slayer, though this Dante is more of a crusader/paladin with holy power and a scythe taken from Death himself. He's in this to rescue his beloved from Hell.
-   Since they are the God's own champions, the heroes of _Darklands_ are supposed to destroy hell's spawn whenever they encounter it. The easiest way to do it is to find a Satanic village, defeat its inhabitants and find their unholy altar. Ironically, summoning the demon may be even harder than actually defeating it, especially when you party has low non-combat skills.
-   Over in _Dark Souls_, the demon-slaying isn't your _main_ job, but there are enough of them between you and your actual objectives that you'll end up taking a few demon heads anyway; in _Dark Souls_, the very first boss is a demon.
-   In _Demon's Souls_, the player character becomes a demon slayer out of necessity since demon souls are the only currency accepted in the Nexus.
-   The Guardians of _Destiny_ are a Science Fantasy version of this as they are all Light-based warriors that fight alien races that threaten humanity, some of whom are allied with The Darkness which is for all intents and purposes the Devil of the setting. Of all their enemies the closest to conventional Demons are the Taken, shadowy versions of all the other enemy races "taken" and corrupted into their current forms by leaders of the Darkness-obsessed Hive, who tick a few of the boxes of being demons themselves.
-   Dante of _Devil May Cry_. He mostly fits into the mercenary type. As a half-demon, he also happens to be a Hunter of His Own Kind. Nero as well in the fourth game. By the sequel he's opened his own wing of Dante's eponymous devil hunting business that he operates out of a van.
-   The _Diablo_ series is ALL about demon slaying.
    -   _Diablo III_ has the Demon Hunter class. They are composed of people who have survived devastating demon attacks and dedicated their lives to eradicating them wherever they are found.
-   Adell's title in _Disgaea 2_ game is Demon Hunter. Before Disgaea, this was the mission of the Church of the Maiden of Light in _La Pucelle._
-   The protagonist of the _Doom_ games, affectionately nicknamed Doomguy. As a Space Marine, killing demons wasn't exactly in this guy's original job description, but when the monsters from hell go on the loose, it's up to him to blast them right back where they came from with a heaping helping of serious firepower. In _Doom (2016)_, it _has_ become his job description: the Doom Slayer is the Sole Survivor of a civilization destroyed by the demons and absorbed into Hell, and madder than all hell about it, to the point of going on an endless Roaring Rampage of Revenge through Hell itself. Because of this, the demons almost all fear him above anything else. "Doom Slayer" is the name _they_ gave him in awe and terror of the slaughter he caused among them. _Doom Eternal_ goes on to state that the Slayer is actually the original Doomguy who after the events of the original games was taken to said alien civilization, rose from a gladiator to a warrior-king, was empowered into a demigod then got trapped in hell again.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   Grey Wardens are a variation. In their day-to-day work, they mostly kill darkspawn, who are closer to orcs than anything else. However, during a Blight, the darkspawn invade the surface en masse, led by an entity known as an Archdemon - and the Wardens are the only people capable of permanently killing such a beast. (Confusingly, Archdemons are not counted as demons or dragons mechanically, but that name is still right there.)
    -   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, part of the job description for a Templar is to take out demons. Their primary job is policing mages to _prevent_ the demons from crossing into the mortal world in the first place and possibly turning the mage into an abomination, but when things go wrong they're on hand to clean up. The player characters in both games doesn't have this as one of their primary jobs, but they'll probably take out a good hundred or so demons and demon-possessed mages in the course of a single game.
    -   Templars in _Dragon Age II_ function mostly as mage killers, but they also have bonuses to damage while fighting demons, likely because blood mages will often have demons in their service.
    -   This is part of the Inquisition's job in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, because there are several holes in the fabric of reality which separates the waking world from the dream world populated by demons and spirits. Demons are leaking into the world all over the place, and the other factions which would be able to deal with it are rather tied up with their own (related) problems, so it's sort of up to the player character and their pals.
-   Many of the Heroes in the _Dragon Quest_ series have slain countless demons (Big Bad, Mooks, and everything in between) in the numerous installments. In fact, most _Dragon Quest_ games are more about fighting _Demons_ than Dragons.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   In _Morrowind_, this is one of the duties of the Ordinators, the elite Church Police of the Tribunal Temple. They keep Morrowind safe from all manner of abominations, including lesser Daedra and Daedra worshipers. (Given their Knight Templar tendencies, their definition of "abomination" is quite broad...)
    -   In _Oblivion_, the Player Character essentially becomes famous for this. Throughout the main quest (with many, _many_ more optional), you'll close several Gates of Oblivion by stepping through, killing your way through lots of Daedra, and seizing the Sigil Stones used to power the gates.
    -   In _Skyrim_, the Vigil of Stendarr formed in response to the events of the previous game. They travel Tamriel to deal with various supernatural threats including Daedra, as well as vampires, lycanthropes, undead, and others. In the _Dawnguard_ DLC, the Vigil's Skyrim headquarters is sacked by the Volkihar vampire clan, who serve as the primary antagonists in the DLC if you choose to join the titular Dawnguard.
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Attack of Darkforce_: Kurogane is the 48th generation in a long line of demon slayers.
-   Ryudo's party in _Grandia II_ are _de facto_ demon hunters, tapped by the Church of Granas to scour the world for pieces of the dark god Valmar. Not all of the characters are in the employ of the church, however; Mareg, for instance, mistakes Ryudo for his brother Melfice, a demonic swordsman who razed Mareg's home village.
-   _Ninja Gaiden_: Ryu Hayabusa battles a variety of threats to the world, among them a race of evil creatures called Fiends which for all intents and purposes are demons. One of his allies is a Fiend hunter named Rachel who is part Fiend herself.
