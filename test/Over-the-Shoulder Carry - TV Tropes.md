Over-the-shoulder carrying (abbreviated OTS) is a method to transport another person. The person is laid face down over one's shoulder with their upper body to the rear. The person's legs are held at the hollow of the knees to secure them. This position allows for relatively easy transportation, even if they are the same weight as oneself. It can be a humiliating pose for the person being carried, since they're turned into a passive object, with their face down, body folded and their buttocks in the air for all to see, (which, depending on the camera angle, also makes it a potential source of Fanservice).

When this happens in fiction, usually (but not always), it involves an antagonist carrying a Damsel in Distress or other captive that they have caught or subdued. Expect such a victim, if conscious, to scream, curse, and make lame attempts to punch the abductor. On the other hand, this method is sometimes used by a hero character as a way of rescuing/evacuating an injured or unconscious victim from a dangerous area, since it allows them to be slightly more mobile than they would be using other carry forms like Bridal Carry, and it leaves one hand free for doing things like opening doors or wielding a weapon. It also does not wear out the carrier as much as a bridal carry would, since most of the weight is placed on the legs instead of the weaker arm muscles. Sometimes in media where males Wouldn't Hit a Girl the interfering female is "neutralized" from the situation by being carried away in this fashion by a support male character when a female available to oppose her isn't available. This can also happen in non-combat situations where a female is trying to make her presence known or is otherwise impeding progress. Compare Neck Lift and Hoist Hero over Head, which are other ways a villain shows of their strength by lifting up a victim.

Sometimes called the Fireman's Carry, although this is actually the name for another position where weight is supported on _both_ shoulders and the carried person is held by both legs and whichever arm is draped over the carrier's shoulder.

Depending on the context and because of position of the person being carried, they may be subject to Pain to the Ass or a Flirtatious Smack on the Ass.

Note that this position (as well as the Fireman's Carry) is often recommended against - it tends to worsen any spinal injuries sustained, and can asphyxiate people in a burning building.

This trope is often performed effortlessly to highlight super strength, or above average physical capabilities. This is always the case when females do this to males, since it occurs less frequently and often highlights physical prowess to match enhanced attractiveness of said female.

Compare Piggyback Cute.

-   Randy Savage did this with Miss Elizabeth a few times, most notably on an edition of _Saturday Nights Main Event_ where George Steele took a liking to Elizabeth.
-   The Schwein/Kryptonite Krunch piledriver starts this way but ends with the attacker only holding one of the legs before planting the opponent's head into the canvas. A popular variation, Mariko Yoshida's air raid crash, is instead done from a fireman's carry, which makes the head planting easier, if less painful looking.
-   One of Black Rose's signatures, since she shows off how strong she is by dumping wrestlers significantly larger than herself into turnbuckles this way.
-   When unauthorized "ROH a Night of Hoopla" special guest referee "Elizabeth" agreed to Machismo King's wedding proposal, Mike Bennett carried her off over his shoulder, to King's chagrin.

    -   A similar instance happens later on when Batman, after defeating Harley Quinn and her thugs at Panessa Studios, carries Harley on his shoulder to a holding cell (while also giving the player a rather suggestive view of her ass)<small>◊</small> and she isn't happy about it, kicking, screaming, and hitting him futilely, while whining like a kindergarten student.

-   _Duke Nukem Forever_ has a "Capture the Babe" mode, in which the player captures said babes and takes them to their base in this manner while fending off opponents. During this time, the player is severely limited in combat, as the only weapon they can use is a tiny Derringer pistol in their free hand. The babe will periodically try to sabotage the player by waving her hand in the player's face; she has to be slapped on the butt to make her stop.
-   In _Far Cry 4_, the player uses this method to move dead bodies so enemies can't find them. There is also a campaign mission where you have to capture Paul Harmon by knocking him out and carrying him to a getaway vehicle. There is a long distance to cover to get there any numerous enemies along the way, so this often requires putting him down to go into combat and then picking him up again. There's also a skill you can unlock that allows you to fire any sort of weapon the game classifies as a sidearm while in situations that only actually require one hand/arm, which carrying corpses (or Paul in that one mission) counts as.

-   In _Professor Layton and the Last Specter_, "Third Eye" Jakes does this to Arianna when he "arrests" her for supposedly masterminding the Specter's rampages throughout the town. Carrying her off in this manner makes it even more obvious that this is essentially a kidnapping, not a sincere effort at upholding the law.
-   _Red Dead Redemption_:
    -   If John Marston kills Javier Escuella instead of capturing him, he will carry Javier's body sorrowfully in this manner: once in bringing him into El Presidio's prison cell for a moment to weep silently over him there before going after the arriving army reinforcements; and once again when he returns to the cell and carries the body outside before handing it over to Edgar Ross and the authorities as proof (although John does get a "What the Hell, Hero?" from Archer Fordham, who had expected him to bring Javier in alive). John also does the same thing if Javier is captured alive, in order to bring him into the same prison cell.
    -   John can also do this to the wanted criminals he hogties in order to bring them in alive for the rewards.

-   In _Sword of the Samurai_, on missions to kidnap family members of rival Samurai lords, the player uses this carry method to take the hostage out of the rival's castle. It's best to make sure all the guards have been cleared out first, as you realistically cannot fight while carrying the hostage. Oddly enough, you also use this method to evacuate your own hostage family members when you perform rescue missions, even though there is no reason they should not be capable of walking out of the castle with you. The most likely explanation for this is that programming a friendly AI character that could safely follow you on their own after you find them would have been too difficult for a game made in 1989.
-   In _Tekken 5_, Craig does this to Anna after defeating her, carrying her off to an unknown place.
-   _Valkyria Chronicles III_ has a non-villainous version in Felix's chapter when he rescues Giulio from enemy reinforcements. Naturally, the screen gives the player a nice view of the latter's butt.
-   How your soldier recovers dead troopers (they won't complain) and their gear, or injured troopers (noted in Worst Aid as being a last ditch way to carry someone, but considering that 1) your soldiers (probably) aren't doctors, and 2) if you have to carry an injured soldier, it's because they are either about to die or you need to evacuate the premises before enemy aircraft arrive to engage your Drop Ship, it's very justified) in _XCOM 2_.
-   In _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_, Donkey Kong's Cargo Throw has been changed so that he hoists and carries his opponents on his shoulder as opposed to above his head like the previous installments, as seen here.
-   Sam Fisher carries bodies around in this fashion in the _Splinter Cell_ games, the original two having him hoist them across both shoulders and _Chaos Theory_/_Double Agent_ having him carry them over one shoulder. Interestingly, the Worst Aid aspect is hinted at in the original game, where Sam carries an injured programmer to a medical office in this manner during the Kalinatek mission, and after giving some exposition, said programmer immediately dies.
-   In _Mass Effect_, Commander Shepard does this twice to evacuate either Ashley or Kaidan. Once on Virmire in _Mass Effect_ after sustaining injuries in combat against the geth and again on Mars in _Mass Effect 3_ after they're critically wounded by a Cerberus robot. Bonus awesome points if it's female Shepard hoisting Kaidan.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

-   Honoka in _Dead Or Alive_ puts her opponents in the position before droping them on their heads in _Dead Or Alive_.

    Webcomics 

-   The one Fred pulls off in _Namesake_ is impressive for a number of reasons, the most obvious being that he does it _at a dead sprint_. Also, given that Elaine was running in the same direction several paces ahead of him, he apparently had to speed up, spin her around and _then_ hoist her over his shoulder without breaking stride - all of which is so fast we don't even see it happening between panels. Coming from anyone else, this would be unbelievable, but...
-   In _Girl Genius_ when Gil swings by and grabs Agatha away from **OTHAR TRYGGVASSEN**, _**Gentleman Adventurer!**_ before knocking the boisterous "hero" out a window she ends up carried mostly over his shoulder.

-   _Totally Spies!_: The girls, especially Clover<small>◊</small>, were carried like this a few times.
-   _T.U.F.F. Puppy_: In "The Doom-mates," Dudley carries Kitty like this a few times because she has no sense of balance after losing her whiskers.
-   _The Twins of Destiny_: In one episode, an Arab slave trader kidnaps Julie to sell her to a sultan by tossing her over his shoulder and running away.
-   _The Venture Brothers_: In "Operation P.R.O.M.", Sergeant Hatred carries a thoroughly tied up and ball-gagged Princess Tinyfeet over his shoulder. She's into bondage, so everything in this scenario is at her behest.
-   In a season two episode of _Star Wars Rebels_ ("Always Two There Are"), Sabine and Zeb try to lay a trap for the Fifth Brother, who is hunting them, using thermal detonators. The plan backfires when the Fifth Brother uses the Force to throw the detonators at Zeb and Sabine. They both survive the explosion, but the blast leaves them unconscious and Sabine is thus taken captive by the Fifth Brother, as shown here.<small>◊</small>
-   Done in _Jackie Chan Adventures_ with Jade and the mook of the day. Being only 12 years old and 3 foot tall and the mook being much bigger than her she had to out wit him to get out of his grasp.

-   Often called the fireman's carry because it allows firemen to carry out fire victims while maintaining a free hand. That said, as noted above, it's fallen out of favor _except_ in the most absolutely dire situations where the risk of death or worse injury is worse than that of further spinal injury, or those where it's obvious that the only injury is from things like burns or smoke inhalation, exhaustion, wounds to the lower legs and feet — if there's a risk that someone's neck or back is injured (as in a vehicle accident or building collapse) or has bullets/impaling objects/shrapnel in/near it (as in the aftermath of an attack/explosion or a building collapse), most firefighters and paramedics are strictly warned _not_ to do this.
-   Unfortunately, along with the Bridal Carry, common among people with little to no medical experience trying to "help" fainted/injured people. Combining this trope with pulling people from a wrecked vehicle or a collapsed building, for example, has led to severe injuries.
-   There's a popular sport in Finland, Asia, and some parts of the U.S. called wife carrying, where men compete in an obstacle race carrying their wives. The wives can be carried piggyback, over the shoulder or Estonian style.
-   It is arguable that Yoshiki Hayashi's neck injuries were exacerbated by the tendency of roadies/staff to carry him off the stage either like this or in a modified Bridal Carry. Road crews and venue staff tend to make the mistake, in general, of carrying injured performers offstage when it is generally a far better idea (especially if the injury has been sufficiently bad to stop the show anyway) to simply remove anything that could further injure someone so badly hurt they can't walk offstage under their own power (e.g. their instruments or gear or accessories, nearby pyro, etc.) and leave him or her _in place_ until properly equipped paramedics arrive.
-   The logo of the Wounded Warrior Project depicts one soldier carrying another in this fashion.
