"_You need subjects for your Servant project, and I can provide them. Beggars, prostitutes, street scum — those who will not be missed by anyone of consequence..._"

Vagrants, the homeless, drifters, runaways, society's castoffs; there are many, _many_ names for them, none of them nice. Most people look away and pretend not to hear the Hobos as they ask for change, if not outright disdain and mistreat them for the crime of having been left behind by society — or having left society behind. With so many moving around, who would even care enough to notice the bum who is usually in the street corner of Trope and Tan every morning has gone missing?

And that is precisely what the Serial Killer, Mad Scientist, hungry monster, and The Mafia are counting on. These exceedingly vulnerable Innocent Bystanders are frequently killed and abducted for fun, for science, for spare parts, to sate hunger, or for a spare dead body. They can be sure the police won't push the investigation too hard; at least not until an attractive young white woman becomes one of the victims.

If anyone _does_ notice, it'll be The Hero, the King of the Homeless, an aid worker, or beat cop who notices familiar faces disappearing. Usually, though, quite a few will die before the culprit is ever caught.

Compare the Disposable Sex Worker (persons targeted for their "immoral" profession as well as their powerlessness), and Kill the Poor, for the slaughter of the impoverished on a much larger scale. Contrast Missing White Woman Syndrome. See also Joggers Find Death, the health-conscious analog.

-   Discussed and Deconstructed in _Diabolik_, where Clerville has a large homeless population (some of which even having banded in a community calling itself the "People of Shadows") and the authorities almost completely ignore them unless there's some politician who wants to get rid of the "parasites". That in spite of said parasites actually playing a _major_ role in the series, as the "People of Shadows" are the ones who taught Diabolik how to get around in Clerville's _immense_ underground gallery network (thus helping him get away from the police again and again).
    -   Exploited in "Ransom for Diabolik": one-shot character and vagrant Matteo has managed to capture Diabolik, and to move him without being noticed tries him up to a wheelchair, dresses him in poor and ruined clothes, and _carries him around in broad daylight_, knowing that nobody would actually give two hobos a second look.

-   Norman Osborn claimed this is how he faked his death; he snuck out of the morgue after his fast-healing kicked in, found and killed a vagrant of his general height and build, and dressed him in the Goblin costume. Clearly, he was of the mindset that such folks are trash, which fits his character perfectly.
-   The short-lived Marvel Universe comic series _The Order (2007)_ had "zobos", down-and-outs turned into zombified cyborgs by the Big Bad.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Abraxas_, Alan Jonah's militia utilize refugees from Moscow's destruction as manual labor and Unwitting Test Subjects.
-   _Concerning a Drifter_ plays with this, as much of the girls Ryuuko's captors kidnapped were, in some way or another, vagrants (being backpacking tourists, migrant workers, and drifters), making them easy targets, as few would/could report them missing or keep track of them, which causes much of the conflict in the fic, as Ryuuko was kidnapped and trafficked while on a nomadic trip and Satsuki tried to find her. Likewise, the fact that Ryuuko was a vagrant makes it harder to get the authorities involved or to track down her captors.
-   In _Dæmorphing: The Guided and the Lost_, the Animorphs learn that the Yeerks have figured out how to sever people from their anchors, and have already successfully separated several homeless humans from their daemons (and Alloran from his guide tree). They're able to save one of the humans before she can be severed, who then becomes a refugee in the Hork-Bajir valley.
-   _Danganronpa: Memento Mori_: While moonlighting as a Serial Killer, Luka targeted vagrants who she believed would not be missed.
-   In _Origins_, a _Mass Effect_/_Star Wars_/_Borderlands_/_Halo_ Massive Multiplayer Crossover, the Republic Intelligence Service takes full advantage of this trope, after starting with the ever-so-slightly-more-defensible "experimenting on criminals sentenced to death." They buy slaves by the shipful, many of whom fall into this category. Even some of the pirates they work with, who usually don't do this because of an agreement with more honest parts of the government, are squeamish.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Serial killer Patrick Bateman in _American Psycho_ becomes frustrated at a homeless man one night and murders him.
-   _An American Werewolf in London_. Three of David's victims in his transformed state are Ted, Joseph, and Alf (who is in fact played by the same guy who was the doomed tramp in _Night of the Big Heat_), a trio of homeless men living in a dump. Averted insofar as their deaths are quickly discovered and reported in the news, and, like all of David's other victims, their spirits haunt him to make him feel guilty about killing them.
-   Classic 1980s B-movie _C.H.U.D._ plays this straight and also inverts it. Several homeless people start turning up missing, but only two workers at a soup kitchen seem to notice or care about this. Later, it's revealed that they're the victims of other homeless people who have been mutated into killer monsters due to exposure to illegally dumped toxic waste and have begun to munch on people who aren't deemed disposable by the powers that be. Along with being a horror movie, the film also functions as a Take That! against Reagan-era policies toward the homeless and mentally ill.
-   In _Deewaar_, a homeless man is found dead on a train with no identification. Nobody seems to care much until Ravi realizes that the man is Anand, his father.
-   In _The Devil-Doll_, Lachna, Malita's servant girl, is "a peasant half-wit" from "a Berlin slum". Marcel and Malita are Mad Scientists who use her as a test subject. She is rendered an eight-inch-tall zombie.
-   In _Die Another Day_, a doctor provides Magic Plastic Surgery for his patients by re-writing their DNA. This process requires DNA from other people; the doctor mentions that most of this is harvested from vagrants and other people who won't be missed.
-   _Donor_ combines this with Organ Theft for a story about a criminal gang which is murdering homeless people in Mongolia and harvesting their organs.
-   _Extreme Measures_ opens with one of those vagrants seeking help from Hugh Grant's character, having escaped from the experiments. Having looked such a man in the eye, he's less willing to accept the later justification that such people were making a Heroic Sacrifice to help those paralyzed by spinal damage walk again.
-   In _The Flesh and the Fiends_, Burke runs a flophouse which gives him access to unending stream of transients and drifters whom no one will miss that he and Hare murder in order to supply cadavers to Dr. Knox.
-   In _The Freakmaker_, a tramp getting drunk under a bridge becomes the first victim of the human/plant hybrid that climbs out of the river.
-   In _A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night_, the vampiric Girl at one point attacks and drains a random homeless man, her only victim in the film who isn't an Asshole Victim.
-   _The Hand_: The first person murdered by the hand is a one-armed wino who bumps into Jon in an alley and harasses him.
-   In _Hard Target_, the Big Bad is the head of a hunting business that allows rich men to hunt homeless or down-on-their-luck war veterans. Homeless or down-on-their-luck so no one cares, war veterans to make it interesting.
-   _The Man Who Never Was_ chronicles the true story of MI-5 dressing up the body of a deceased man as a fictitious Marine officer carrying papers regarding a planned invasion of Sardinia, with the intention of misleading German intelligence. In real life, the body was that of a vagrant, described by one of the organizers as "a bit of a ne'er-do-well and that the only worthwhile thing that he ever did he did after his death".
-   In _The Matrix_, Agent Smith takes over the Matrix avatar of a human, which happens to be a vagrant, to attack Neo in the subway, and said human perishes when Neo kills Smith. All humans branched on the Matrix are equally disposable to the Machines, anyway.
-   _New Town Killers_: While chasing Sean through the subway, Alistair shoots a homeless man's dog for barking at him. He then shoots the vagrant For the Evulz.
-   _Night of the Big Heat_, the first onscreen victim of the aliens is an old tramp living in a cave out in the woods. None of the other characters are aware of his death.
-   In _Not of This Earth_ (1957), Johnson, the alien agent on Earth, invites three homeless men to join him for dinner so that he can steal their blood for his experiments.
-   _Power Rangers (2017)_ has a subversion. Rita Repulsa goes around killing homeless people for their gold teeth, but because Angel Grove is a small town and she's not hiding evidence, it's immediately noticed and the police declare her a serial killer.
-   In _Rat Race_, when a heart meant for emergency transplantation gets damaged, the character responsible for delivering it suggests looking for a 'drifter', killing him, and cutting his heart out as a replacement. At which point the driver starts asking questions about the character's background. Enrico does catch on quickly, though.
-   In _Stuck_, Brandi and Rashid use this trope to justify letting Tom die after Brandi hits him with her car and leaves him in her garage to die, having decided that he’s “just” a homeless man.
-   In _Surviving the Game_, the Big Bad is the head of a hunting business that allows rich men to hunt homeless or down-on-their-luck war veterans. Homeless or down-on-their-luck so no one cares, war veterans to make it interesting. No, this is not a redundant entry.
-   Alex, the Big Bad of _TAU_, deliberately kidnaps people living on the fringes of society for his AI research, reasoning (correctly) that they won't be missed.
-   _The Theatre Bizarre_: "Vision Stains" is about a writer/serial killer who cannot dream. She extracts fluid from her victims' eyes as they die and injects it into her own eye so she can experience the others' lives as they flash by in their dying moments. She preys on female vagrants, runaways and prostitutes, believing that only women are truly creative, and claims that she only targets women who want to die.
-   _Theatre of Death_: The fourth victim of the killer, and the first murder shown on screen, is a drunken tramp murdered under a bridge in Paris.

-   In _Venom (2018)_, the Life Foundation kidnaps homeless people to use as human guinea pigs in their (usually deadly) experiments with the symbiotes. Because the film takes place in San Francisco, which has a high homeless population, nobody notices. One of the scientists is utterly disgusted by the experiments, and reaches out to Eddie Brock to help her bring the Life Foundation down. Eddie is equally horrified, and at first tries to subtly gather evidence to bring to the police... but then he sees that one of the homeless people who was kidnapped is his friend Maria. At this point, Eddie forgets all about staying hidden and tries to break her out, which of course has immediate consequences.
-   _Willy's Wonderland_: The murderous animatronics have a pact with the town's sheriff that they'll leave the townspeople alone if they're regularly fed. Drifters coming through town are offered a large amount of money to clean up the abandoned restaurant overnight, none of them suspecting that they're about to get eaten by Willy and his friends.

    Literature 

-   In Animorphs, the Yeerks are interested in keeping a lot profile and not allowing humans as a whole to realize that they're being invaded. This sometimes means rounding up witnesses. Many of them are infested, those with connections are sometimes allowed to escape if they'd be missed, but those without are often simply killed. In the very first book Hork-Bajir Controllers kill a man sleeping in a construction site.
    -   In book 28, Yeerk scientists are trying to find a way to suppress free will in humans, at the instigation of Visser Three. They use chimpanzee subjects at first, but when the Visser visits and the chimps pelt him with feces he orders his scientists to shut this phase down and move directly to humans. The Yeerk scientist in charge initially seems sympathetic - aware of what the Visser is like he's falsified all his data and would rather die than have that discovered - but Cassie becomes furious when he refers to the human subjects as homeless trash.
-   A Stephen King novella called _Apt Pupil_ about a teenager and a Nazi war criminal hiding in a small American town who both kill homeless people.
-   In _Breathers: A Zombie's Lament_, we never actually see the zombies hunting for food, but homeless victims are mentioned a few times, and that it's a good rule of thumb to go after those whose disappearances will go unnoticed.
-   Used a few times in Joseph Payne Brennan's stories.
    -   In _Slime_, homeless drifter Henry Hossing is the slime's first victim. He's just passing through, and consequently, no one notices his disappearance — everyone just assumes he moved on. By the time someone _does_ discover that he's missing, the initial assumption is that Henry himself is the murderer. Only after people begin surviving the slime's attacks to tell their story do the police realize Henry was just another victim.
    -   In _The Corpse of Charlie Rull_, chronic alcoholic Charlie Rull dies of a heart attack and falls into a polluted swamp, where he's resurrected as a zombie and goes on a killing spree. Both because he's homeless and because the story takes place in such a short span of time, Charlie's fate goes undiscovered at first. Even his fellow homeless men only realize something happened to him when he turns up at their campsite and attacks them.
    -   In _The Impulse to Kill_, an interesting variation is provided when the protagonist chooses not homeless people to kill, but criminals who he dupes into attempting to rob him because he believes no one will care if would-be thieves are killed while committing a robbery. He's right. At first, at least. Past a certain point, the police start getting suspicious that so many people keep getting killed attempting to rob him, forcing him to move and begin again in a new town.
    -   In _The Barren Place_, the descendants of the Iroquois living in Seneca Center regularly sacrifice drifters, vagrants, and even gainfully-employed people passing through town to the spirits of their ancestors, figuring nobody will realize they've gone missing. The protagonist, Sannerton, isn't homeless, but he has come to Seneca Center to write undisturbed and hasn't told anyone where he is, allowing the tribe to kill him without arousing suspicion.
-   The ending of Mark Twain's _The Carnival of Crime in Connecticut_ reveals (after the narrator has vigorously beaten his conscience to death) that he has a large stock of homeless people in his basement for sale.
    
    In conclusion, I wish to state, by way of advertisement, that medical colleges desiring assorted tramps for scientific purposes, either by the gross, by cord measurement, or per ton, will do well to examine the lot in my cellar before purchasing elsewhere, as these were all selected and prepared by myself, and can be had at a low rate, because I wish to clear out my stock and get ready for the spring trade.
    
-   _The Extinction Parade_. Vampires hunt humans for their blood. They normally drink the blood of poor people, expecting society to chalk up their deaths to street crime.
-   In _Fat White Vampire Blues,_ vampire protagonist Jules is a sympathetic character, but is _not_ a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire; he may munch the occasional criminal if they come after him, but mostly he preys on those who won't be missed, and there's no shortage of those in New Orleans. Subverted at the end, however, when he finds out that the seemingly anonymous homeless woman he fed on at the very beginning of the book was a beloved pillar of the community who constantly did everything she could to help others despite having nothing herself. This makes Jules realize that no, he's not "just eating", he really has spent the last hundred years murdering people.
-   In _Final Watch_, when a renegade vampire needs to murder and drain five dozen people to ascend into a High Vampire, he goes after migrant workers, knowing that, since they are mostly not registered, nobody is going to miss them.
-   _Galax-Arena_: The children kidnapped and whisked away to the planet Vexak are mostly street children from slums in third world countries. They're targeted because nobody important will miss them.
-   Many of the children taken by the Gobblers (at first) in _His Dark Materials_ fit this profile. The Gobblers target children that no one important will miss, whether that means the children of the poor or the children of the mistrusted Gyptian boat people.
-   In _Hope and Red_, the biomancers, who are a frightening hybrid of Mad Scientist and Knight Templar, view the population of Paradise Circle — a largely impoverished and criminal neighborhood — this way.
-   In _The House of Night_ series, the Red Fledglings, Stevie Rae included, have all killed and eaten homeless people. This is treated as something humorous and mildly embarrassing.
-   In _The Migax Cycle_, the lower classes are often treated like they are worthless, and Mililabs has no trouble getting away with running experiments on them.
-   In the _Modesty Blaise_ novel _The Night of Morningstar_, terrorists order a potential new recruit to murder a teenaged drug addict abducted at random from the streets as an If You're So Evil, Eat This Kitten! test.
-   A somewhat funny, if you have a dark sense of humour, variation occurs in C. S. Lewis' _Out of the Silent Planet_. The protagonist walks into the plot, despite not being actually homeless or disposable. But as a lecturer on vacation, he, as he blightly tells the men about to kidnap him for nefarious purposes, doesn't exist until the academic year begins. Why, he can vanish off the face of the Earth and nobody will look for him...
-   In the sci-fi book _Parable of the Talents_, the Christian America cult started out with putting vagrants in their concentration camps because nobody would notice or care.
-   _The Place Inside the Storm_: The brain implant that's supposed to cure autism was originally tested on homeless people. For all Loki knows, he might have been one.
-   The villains of the novel _Rainbow Six_ use homeless people as test subjects for their plan. The book spends quite some time following them as they have no clue what's going on.
-   Discussed in _The Rhesus Chart_ regarding Our Vampires Are Different. Unlike movie vampires, the ones in the novel are essentially serial killers, so need to pick victims that no one will miss. That means the elderly or homeless runaways, not pretty young things who can afford to go to nightclubs.
-   In _The Saga of Darren Shan_, the vampaneze are a clan of vampires who are biologically compelled to kill anyone they drink from (other vampires generally only take a small amount of blood without much harming their prey). A prophecy makes the villain of the series into their absolute ruler, who none dare disobey. They begin to target homeless people as an easy way to eat while staying under the radar, as the fight between them and the protagonist's clan of vampires escalates. This later bites the vampaneze back when the vampires recruit the homeless community to aid them, and they're all too happy to fight back.
-   Subverted by Sherlock Holmes. His network of homeless people sees basically everything that goes on in London, and all he has to do to get information is to provide a hot meal.
-   _The Ship Who... Partnership_: Alpha likes to test experimental drugs on humans (rabbits take work to care for and she doesn't want pets), and boasts that the people she used as subjects weren't contributing to society before she got her hands on them. Being caught got her in trouble in school, but her connections have her sent to run a charity ward in a clinic in the middle of nowhere instead of facing real consequences. As most of the patients in the charity ward don't have money or influence, she starts right back up again.
-   _Star Trek: Enterprise Relaunch:_ One alien civilization dependent on the Ware has been feeding it their homeless population. So much so they're starting to run out, and are seriously considering bumping up to Disposable War Veterans...
-   Michael Stackpole's _Wolf & Raven_ short story "Fair Game", set in the world of the _Shadowrun_ Tabletop Game. The Pacific Northwest Hunting Club is made up of wealthy people who hunt humans once per month. They choose their prey from among the SINless of Seattle, who are not part of the system and whose deaths are not even investigated.
-   Whitley Strieber's novel _Wolfen_. The title monsters have the New York ghettos as their hunting grounds. They kill and eat the abandoned of humanity (homeless, drug abusers, outcasts), those that will not be missed.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Arrow_: The Count got his moniker from the twin-injector marks he left in the fifty-six vagrants and prostitutes he murdered to perfect the drug Vertigo. Despite this serial killing spree, no-one knows who the Count is until the drug hits the streets and starts killing pretty young socialites, and our hero Oliver Queen only finds out when his sister Thea gets high and crashes her car.
-   _Babylon 5_. Subverted in "Exogenesis", in which Lurkers are being taken over by Puppeteer Parasites in what seems to be the usual _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_\-type plot. However, it's pointed out that if you were secretly trying to take over the station, you wouldn't choose people with no influence. Turns out it's entirely voluntary.

-   The UnSub in the _Criminal Minds_ episode "Legacy" kidnaps homeless people, prostitutes, drug users, etc. and kills them. He's only caught because a detective whose OCD forces him to catalogue everyone he comes into contact with on the streets notices that _63_ of them have disappeared without a trace.
-   _Doctor Who_, Old and New, uses this a lot, as a vagrant is usually the first person to discover the Monster of the Week. Sometimes the vagrant knows the Monster of the Week.
    -   "The War Machines" featured a vagrant who had slept in an empty building the villains had taken over. They kill him.
    -   "Resurrection of the Daleks" begins with a homeless guy witnessing some escaping test subjects being gunned down by the Daleks' human minions, before he himself is shot as well.

    -   "Daleks in Manhattan"/"Evolution of the Daleks": The Daleks abduct the homeless of "Hooverville" to be converted into a Pig Man workforce. By the time the Doctor and Martha arrive, however, the situation has got bad enough that it's made the front page of the newspapers, although the police still haven't done anything.
        
        **Martha:** Have you been to the police?  
        **Solomon:** Yeah, we tried that. Another deadbeat goes missing, big deal.
        
    -   A resurrected (again) Master in "The End of Time" finds himself scurrying across the junkyards and finds himself amongst two homeless men who notice his "uncanny resemblance" to Harold Saxon. Driven by Horror Hunger from his botched revival, it's heavily implied he eats them alive.
    -   Later subverted in the final scene of "Day of the Moon" when a Creepy Child approaches a homeless man and says, "I'm dying. But I can fix that. It's easy, really... see?"

-   In _The Killing_'s third season, the Pied Piper targets teenage homeless girls, who have been forgotten by society; this allowed the killer to operate unnoticed for years.
-   At least one murderer on _Law & Order: Criminal Intent_ was hoping that the police wouldn't look too hard at a bunch of dead homeless people turning up. Big mistake.
-   A Mad Scientist in _Lois & Clark_ states she always uses people who won't be missed for her experiments... and is very distressed to learn the latest subject was an undercover reporter for a major newspaper.
-   _The Magician_: In "The Illusion of the Deadly Conglomerate", a down and out friend of Tony's contacts Tony for help after a friend of his disappears from a homeless mission, and the Sinister Minister running the mission claims to have never heard of him.

-   _The New Avengers_: One of the victims of the giant rat in "Gnaws" is a tramp.
-   One episode of _The Pretender_ featured a research doctor who was testing his resuscitation drugs on the homeless — which meant stopping their hearts.
-   In _Primeval_, one of the Monsters of the Week was a prehistoric crocodile-like beast that had been feeding off the homeless population of a construction yard for years. It only becomes a problem when one of the workers burns the creature's lair (thinking it was a hobo den) forcing it to look for prey elsewhere.
-   In _RoboCop: The Series_, the Mad Scientist Dr. Cray-Z does this to get a living brain for his experiment. Unfortunately, his accomplice is simply dumping the bodies, and the police are suspicious, to say the least, of homeless people being killed by a Serial Killer who takes their brains.
-   _Squid Game_ revolves around hundreds of people facing financial ruin being offered a chance to participate in a Deadly Game for tens of millions of dollars in prize money, all for the amusement of a few rich guys. The mastermind in particular was a cynical man who believed Humans Are Bastards, and his final "game" is a bet on whether the "trash" homeless man across the street would have anyone come to his aid within the next few hours. He loses, but unfortunately doesn't live to see Rousseau proven right.
-   In the _Tales from the Crypt_ episode "Mournin' Mess", a secret society of ghouls start a funeral service for homeless people (that they kill) so they can eat the corpses without the risk of being caught gravedigging. Slightly subverted since it's implied that the ghouls have to bribe city officials to keep the police from investigating the violent murders too closely. Some of the city officials _were_ members of the (G)rateful (H)omeless (O)utcast & (U)nwanted (L)ayaway (S)ociety.
-   The Granada Television adaptation of _Sherlock Holmes_: In the episode "The Norwood Builder" the titular bad guy kills a vagabond sailor to frame his victim for murder.
-   Jimmy McNulty from _The Wire_ both exploits and inverts this trope when he fabricates a fraudulent serial-killer case around the corpses of vagrants, in order to attract media and political attention and divert funds to real police work. Exploited, because he only gets away with it by doctoring files on deaths nobody otherwise cares about and inverted because "drawing attention to the vulnerability of the homeless" is the reason given for openly courting the media (although he's fully aware that what really gets it into the headlines is the juicy "serial killer" angle). He even "abducts" one live vagrant (putting him up in an out-of-the-way dosshouse) to add a sense of urgency to the case.
-   _The X-Files_: In the episode "731", one member of the Syndicate informs Scully that Japanese Deadly Doctors and Evilutionary Biologists were performing horrible experiments on lepers, homeless, and insane people in the USA. However, they usually have no scruples about abducting anybody, not excluding their own family members or fairly high-profile FBI agents.

    Music 

-   In Macabre's "Burke and Hare" start killing vagrants so they can sell their bodies.

    Podcasts 

-   _The Last Podcast on the Left_ refers to this idea as the "Less Dead". They note how multiple serial killers, such as Gary Ridgeway and Robert Pickton, were able to get away with their crimes because their main targets were prostitutes, whose deaths garnered little official attention, or _black_ prostitutes, who got basically none.

    Roleplay 

-   In _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_, Daigo gains powers of vampirism and decides to use them against the wealthy elite. Before that, however, he and his gang first drive over to a low-income neighbourhood to test his newfound power on an innocent drifter that no one will miss. Daigo's blood transforms him into a monster, who then starts wreaking havoc around the neighbourhood — which draws the attention of one of the protagonists since he lives on said street.

-   _Shadowrun_
    -   1st Edition supplement _Sprawl Sites_. In one of the adventure seeds, a Banshee (elf vampire) settles into one of the poorest neighborhoods and preys on local vagrants and squatters.
    -   The Universal Brotherhood was a cover organization organized by insect spirits and insect shamans. Many UB facilities were set up in run-down areas and ostensibly tried to help the homeless, while actually luring them in to be possessed by insect spirits.
    -   In the supplement _Double Exposure_, an unholy alliance between the Renraku MegaCorp and insect spirits exploits homeless people in Seattle, testing experimental medical products on them and changing them into monsters.

    Theme Parks 

-   In his backstory, Universal Studios's Halloween Horror Nights's Dr. Albert Caine AKA The Caretaker would offer homeless people to stay at his mansion until they got on their feet. He neglected to mention that he would also use them as test subjects for his torturous and very lethal medical experiments.

    Video Games 

-   In _Assassin's Creed_, the "patients" of Garnier's hospital are mostly beggars, prostitutes, madmen, and other homeless taken from Jerusalem by Talal's slave ring. Garnier's plan was to use his drugs to cure their addictions and insanities, followed by training and conditioning them as soldiers, to turn them into loyal warriors in the service of the Templars.
-   _Assassin's Creed Syndicate_: Taking place in London during the Industrial Revolution, vagrants abound in the city, so naturally Jacob Frye will find himself dealing with Templars taking advantage of the population. Of special note is one of the missions in the Dreadful Crimes DLC which featured, amongst other things, homeless disappearing which Jacob and Evie investigate. It turns out that a deranged man was not only killing the homeless, whom he considered a blight on the city, but parceling their bodies out to neighborhood businesses such as the tanner's, the fertilizer maker's, and the butcher's.
-   The poor are everywhere and not well regarded in _Aviary Attorney_, something which fuels the revolutionaries seeking a more just society. In 4C (Fraternité) elements seeking to keep the revolution from being civilized kill a homeless man and a random poor woman and pin it on the police. Jayjay Falcon is horrified, and the Rebel Leader cynically notes that he's not noticed that these kinds of things have been happening all along.
-   _Baldur's Gate III_: Before the events of the game, vampire spawn Astarion was tasked with kidnapping people for his master to drink. He notes that Fraygo's Flophouse (a very cheap motel on the edge of the city) was full of people no one would miss, and that the Elfsong Tavern (a popular adventurer's bar) knows his face too well. His master's chamberlain also scolded him and his 'siblings' in writing for kidnapping a few too many nobles, who are up in arms.
-   _BloodRayne 2_ has homeless people (and sex workers) being kidnapped to be turned into a blood fog (the shroud) that protects vampires from sunlight.
-   _Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach_: The game's story has major implications involving this. The player character, Gregory, is hinted to be a homeless child. It's noted several times that there are no records of him inside the PizzaPlex, and that he shows a surprising amount of resourcefulness and ruthlessness (bordering on Troubling Unchildlike Behavior) over the course of the game. One ending shows Gregory sleeping inside an alleyway inside a cardboard box with a newspaper for warmth. Keeping in mind that the game's premise involves Gregory being hunted down by a serial child killer, it'd mean that he'd be an ideal target for said killer as not as many people would look for him. Sure enough, this same ending shows Vanny looming over him, implying that he is Killed Offscreen.
-   _Grand Theft Auto V_: Trevor notes he hadn't 'killed a human' before meeting Michael — just some foxes, bears, vagrants...
    -   You are expected to kill vagrants as part of some side quests, including a mad cult of cannibal vagrants. Since the police don't patrol the wilderness, there's no overt penalty.
-   In _Mad Father_, the titular character is a Mad Scientist who used only people who "wouldn't be missed" for his horrible experiments.
-   In _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_, Desperado is kidnapping vagrant kids to turn into cyborg Child Soldiers.
-   _Mother Russia Bleeds_: the romani protagonists were kidnapped by the Bratva to be used a guinea pigs to perfect a new and more potent version of Nekro.
-   _Night in the Woods_: The cult believes that the Black Goat will bring prosperity to Possum Springs if they practice Human Sacrifice. To this end, they specifically target people who are unlikely to be missed, including the homeless and drifters. Casey Hartley, one of Mae's friends who disappeared mysteriously, was one of their victims; while he wasn't actually a runaway, his delinquent tendencies led people to assume he just ran away from home rather than abducted and murdered.
-   _Persona 3_: the Kirijo Group kidnapped hundred of orphants living on the streets and used them as test subjects in the creation of artifical Persona users. Strega (Takaya Sakaki, Jin Shirato and Chidori Yoshino) were the sole survivors out of the original batch.
-   In _Portal 2_, the recorded messages of Aperture Science founder Cave Johnson depict the gradual decline of his company in both finances and prestige. One symptom of this is that, while the first batch of Mad Science tests were carried out using the 'best and brightest', such as "astronauts, Olympians, and war heroes", the second batch of tests (after the 1968 Senate hearings on missing astronauts) were conducted on street bums. They were offered 60 bucks to leave their park benches, sit in "much more comfortable" waiting rooms, and die horribly testing the company's lethal products. They could earn a $60 bonus if they allowed themselves to be disassembled, have "science stuff" installed, and then put back together, "good as new". In the _third_ set of recordings, he'd apparently discarded even this idea and moved on to testing on his own employees, including himself.
-   Roger Wilco, lowly Janitor Second Class of _Space Quest VI: Roger Wilco in the Spinal Frontier_, was selected by Dr. Hayden Beleaux and Sharpei to be the test subject of Project: Immortality, simply because "We thought no one would miss you. Go Figure." Stellar Santiago unwillingly takes his place after saving him.
-   The _Thief_ video game series uses this in the second and third games.
    -   The villain of _Thief II: The Metal Age_ uses the homeless to create his army of Steampunk cyborgs. It is explicitly stated that the nobles don't notice or care, and the victims are being arrested by the Watch, shipped, and converted in small groups so that it goes unreported.
    -   The villain of _Thief: Deadly Shadows_ kills the homeless and absorbs their life force to extend her lifespan. Sometimes she flays them alive to use their skins as a disguise.
-   _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines_
    -   One of the Plaguebearers in a sidequest used the homeless to spread his infection. The other one used prostitutes.
    -   Andrei the Tzimice used, among others, homeless people as raw material for his experiments...and his home improvement projects.
    -   The game as a whole downplays this trope. Homeless people are some of the easiest targets for the Player Character to feed on because they tend to hide alone in dark alleys. This still provokes a police response if anyone else sees you though but this is unlikely. Killing them will lead to a loss of Humanity since they're innocent people.

A Ghost team is self-sustaining and can set up facilities to produce more of them, but they need organic material and a brain to work with in order to rapidly make another Ghost. Therefore, they prefer to prey upon homeless children.

    Western Animation 

-   Reginald of _American Dad!_ was little more than an unwanted, unloved homeless man before volunteering for a CIA experiment that switched his mind with that of a koala bear. The procedure was a success and he was hired by the CIA as an operative due to the distracting nature of his new form.
-   Never demonstrated on screen, but _Archer_ gave us Dr. Krieger, who occasionally mentions that he exploits the poor as scientific fodder or entertainment.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_
    -   Both series had episodes about homeless people being abducted for use as slave labor. To them, no one seems to care but obviously, Batman is on the case.
    -   A villain-of-the-week uses homeless children to carry out a series of thefts in the city. Batman is not happy about it, to say the least.
-   An early episode of _Family Guy_ has Peter mention that Rudy Guliani had New York's homeless population secretly murdered as part of the urban restoration projects.
-   In Disney's _Gargoyles_, Dr. Sevarius uses Maggie, a homeless woman, in his mutation experiments because nobody will notice she's gone. All of the mutates but Talon (Derek Maza) have no known families.

Joe: Renegades_, James McCullen kidnaps homeless veterans off the street and forces them to test his new combat mechs in order to find the perfect human brainwaves on which to base machine's the A.I.

-   _Pantheon_:Mr. Prasad casually reveals that before Chandra, he picked several guinea pigs from the slums of Mumbai to test the uploading process on. Chandra is horrified by this inhumanity while Prasad doesn't blink an eye at these lost lives.
-   _The Simpsons_
    -   In one Halloween episode, Lisa's teacher invites a homeless man into the class on the pretense of offering him a hot meal so the students can see Homer, the new Grim Reaper, reap someone.
    -   In another Halloween episode Mayor Quimby starts feeding the homeless to Homer, who has become a giant Blob Monster.
    -   In one episode, Homer mentions that a cold snap has killed off most of Springfield's homeless population.
    -   After Homer foolishly exposes himself as Mr. X, to get the Pulitzer and million-dollar prize, he starts making up news so people can visit his website. When Nelson says they are dissecting hobos at school, Homer politely brushes him off, saying he doesn't need to report real news anymore.
-   _SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron_
    -   In the episode "Mutation City," the first victim of Dr. Viper's monsters is a homeless guy in an alley.
    -   Likewise, an earlier episode, "The Giant Bacteria," has Morbulus. He's an interesting case in that he starts out as a villain in his own right, but becomes this trope following his humiliating defeat by the SWAT Kats. After Faking the Dead, he encounters Dr. Viper, who takes him back to his lab in the Dead Forest. Because everyone thinks he's either dead or in hiding, no one will come looking for him, making him the perfect candidate for Viper to turn into the Monster of the Week.
    -   Mac and Molly in "The Metallikats" are an interesting case as well. Although the duo basically fit this trope, being unidentified corpses in prison uniforms who wash up on the beach near a scientist's house, said scientist is the kindly Professor Hackle, who turns them into robots to save their lives and prove his theories about mind transfer. However, Hackle learns their names after they come back to life and makes it clear that he intends to be forthcoming about who they are when unveiling them to the scientific academy.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)_:
    -   A supervillain called the "Garbageman" abducts homeless people turning them into slaves, referring to them as "human garbage". The police haven't noticed the abductions or perhaps don't even care.
    -   While not all homeless, the Foot did the same thing for mutant weapons research, leading to the creation of Quarry and the others.

    Real Life 

-   An unusual example of this trope being turned to positive ends in real life was a secret British disinformation operation during World War II known as "Operation Mincemeat." The body of a deceased homeless man named Glyndwr Michael was given a new identity as a Royal Marines officer, dressed in a uniform, and left on a Spanish shore, presumably the victim of a downed aircraft. On his person were falsified documents that indicated that the Allies intended to attack Greece and Sardinia rather than the real target, Sicily. The supposedly neutral Spanish government (as neutral as the Franco dictatorship could get) shared the documents with German intelligence, which fell for the ruse. This allowed the Allies to invade Sicily with a minimum of casualties, giving them their first foothold in the Italian campaign. Michael's body was buried under his alias, Major William Martin, with full military honors.
-   Homeless people were used by the Brazilian military to teach torture techniques during their own dictatorship.
