Motorcycles are often treated as the modern day equivalent of horses. Some works take this an extra step and have the protagonist engage in jousting from the back of a motorbike.

Do Not Try This at Home unless you are on a closed stunt course _and_ are trained in stunt riding _and_ are either left-handed or have a modified brake. Waving or pointing an object, especially if you're right-handed, means _taking your hand away from the handbrake,_ which is often in and of itself a lethally stupid idea. (Unlike motorcycles, horses can be commanded to stop or slow down verbally as well as via the reins, and reins can be held in either hand. Unless a motorcycle is modified, its handbrake is on the right hand, and until voice command technology improves, a vehicle cannot be commanded to stop or slow down via voice.) If you attempt to "joust" a motorbike without proper training, the bike will most likely flip over and crush you underneath it.

Left-handed people or a specially wired handbrake can prevent that, but holding out or waving a long object can also cause your bike to become unbalanced or the object to catch on something - which will also often cause a crash. Note the Darwin Award winner and the guys that managed to crash each other in the examples...

Sister Trope to Air Jousting.

    Comic Books 

-   In the _2000 AD_ adaptation of _The Stainless Steel Rat_, "Slippery Jim" diGriz lands on a Feudal Future planet and finds the nobility jousting with flying motorbikes. He finds this rather dull and quickly adds his own unique spin.
    
    **Jouster:** 'Pon my word! The chap's upside down! Is that allowed in the rules?
    
    **Slippery Jim:** Course it isn't, you snark! Nobody's ever bothered to **write** any rules!
    
-   _Batman_: In keeping with their theme, the Knight and the Squire (England's equivalent of Batman and Robin) have lances they use from the back of their motorcycle steeds.

    Fanfiction 

-   A one-sided version occurs in _Fall of Liberty_. The Lost MC ride their bikes into zombie hordes while taking them down with baseball bats.
-   Kay'la from _Vow of Nudity_ takes part in a jousting competition shortly after summoning her first magic horse, but quickly realizes she has no idea how to ride a horse. So, taking advantage of the fact that one competitor is a warforged on a clockwork steed, she shapeshifts her own horse into an identical copy (to qualify it for the tournament) and then rebuilds it into a motorcycle.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   The 1981 George Romero film Knightriders is all about a motorcycle jousting ren faire troop.
-   _Dhoom 3_ has Jai and Sahir (Or is it Samar?) motorcycle jousting in the end chase.
-   There is some motorcycle jousting in the city where the girl goes to get help in the 1990 z-grade flick _Dune Warriors_.
-   In a variant involving cars, in _Herbie Rides Again_ there are people who are called Knights and who dress in wacky costumes who joust in one scene.
-   Indiana Jones charges a Nazi motorcyclist using a flagpole as an improvised lance in _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_.

-   At the climax of _Mission: Impossible II_, Ethan and the Big Bad do this — with guns.
    -   Parodied on wheelchairs in _Scary Movie 2_.
-   In _Pig Hunt_, the gasmask redneck is mounted on a dirt bike and uses a makeshift lance in an attempt to run down Ben inside the cabin. Of course, as Ben does not have a bike or a lance, its not exactly a fair fight; making this more of a case of 'Motorcycle Pig-sticking'.
-   _Project A_ has _bicycle_ jousting, when Jackie Chan grabs a laundry pole to take down a pair of mooks.
-   In another variant, _Quick Change_ gives us a bizarre (and apparently lethal) bicycle jousting scene. Loomis panics and yells that "it's bad luck just seeing a thing like that!"
-   _RoboCop 2_. Alex Murphy has a joust with Cain: Murphy on a motorcycle, Cain in an armored car.
-   Fred in the live-action movie _Scooby-Doo: Monsters Unleashed_ rides a motorcycle to duel the Black Knight Ghost.
-   Terence Hill and Bud Spencer do it in _Watch Out, We're Mad_. After being chased by mobsters on motorcycles, both protagonists enter a meadow with cows to perform this, using long branches as weapons.

    Literature 

-   _The Dresden Files_: Done as a team by Harry Dresden and Karrin Murphy in _Blood Rites_. The normal difficulties are somewhat alleviated by Harry handling the "lance" (a magically charged wizard's staff in this case) while Murphy drives the bike. A heaping helping of magic supercharged with hellfire smooths out the rest.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Arrow_: In "Sara", Komodo and the Arrow ride motorcycles at each other while shooting arrows.
-   _Doctor Who_: The Doctor has a motorcycle jousting match against one of the Bannermen in "Delta and the Bannermen".
-   _Get Smart_: In "The Mild Ones", Max has to infiltrate a biker gang called the Purple Knights. The initiation test is jousting on motorcycles.
-   In the "Camelot Capers" episode _The Goodies_ had to joust a horseback knight while mounted on their iconic three-seater bicycle. It doesn't go well for them.

-   Happens infrequently in the _Kamen Rider_ franchise. The most famous example is _Kamen Rider Kuuga_, where the titular Kuuga had a bike specifically known for maneuverability, and could joust just about anywhere (roads, beaches and even inside buildings).

    Manga 

-   In _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_, Shigure once does a motorcycle joust against an armored horseman.

    Music Videos 

-   In the music video for "Team", Lorde heads up a secret society as two guys participate in motorcycle jousting as part of the initiation process.

    New Media 

-   Unconfirmed Darwin Awards nominee: two guys, fighting over a girl, jousted on motor scooters and died.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Deadlands: Hell on Earth_, the Omega Knights are a group based in Junkyard. They ride motorcycles and battle other biker gangs with lances.
-   _Shadowrun_ 1st edition supplement _Shadowbeat_. In the Combat Biker game the Lancebiker player carries a 2 meter long lance that he can use against other players.

    Urban Legends 

-   A Mugging the Monster story from the Society for Creative Anachronism gives us an _unintentional_ version; A group wanted to hold fight practice with functional replica weaponry. This required a few permits and a change of venue from their regular park. There was one available, but the police warned them that the local motorcycle gang considered it their turf and may not take too kindly to strangers. Seeing no other options, the SCA risked it. Sure enough, the motorcycle club showed up and started hassling the re-creationists. Seems that the battle pikes and other implements that were useful for removing mounted knights from their horses worked just as well for taking riders off their hogs.

    Video Games 

-   _Another Eden_: Once Galliard takes enough damage, he rips off the machine gun on his bike and pulls out a giant electro lance to fight the player, while still riding his motorcycle.

-   _Henry Stickmin Series_: in _Stealing the Diamond_, during the Agressive scenario, Henry can pick up a medieval lance when rushing through the museum on his scooter. However, he fails to hold it properly, which causes it to hit the ground and catapult Henry off his scooter. The fail screen even comments on this.
    
    Jousting. It's harder than it looks.
