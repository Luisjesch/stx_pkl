Nine months later...

_"Know your beard," Holmes had once taught him. "It is a reliable measure for the passage of time, when_ in extremis_."_

A long amount of time passes. A clean-shaven character is shown in the next scene with a beard. Or, if the facial hair is minimal, a full and/or longer beard (and sometimes additionally longer hair on their head) will be seen. Often used in animated media as Rule of Funny and sometimes involves the beard disappearing in the next scene, growing on children, or even being ripped off. Nearly Always Male, except in the very few occasions where it is used with women (usually limited to hair length or Girls With Mustaches parody). A form of Show, Don't Tell.

A Sub-Trope of Expository Hairstyle Change. Compare Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow, Perma-Shave, and Beardness Protection Program. Can overlap with Beard of Sorrow.

Not to Be Confused with Growing the Beard, though growing a beard can be such a harbinger.

Waiting Skeleton is a more extreme version of the same type of gag.

    Advertising 

-   Done in an old Chuck E. Cheese commercial.

This montage also shows the time that was spent cleaning up the mess from the failed revolution, allowing a reset without trivializing the scenario.

The movie follows the latter until the year 2012 when he returns from a long voyage to the North Pole with a particularly impressive beard.

-   In Attack of the Clones, Obi-Wan Kenobi turns up with a beard that he has grown since the last movie. This was filmed three years after The Phantom Menace, but ten years have passed in-story. Thus in addition to showing the passage of time, the beard helps baby-faced Ewan McGregor, now several years younger than his character is supposed to be thanks to the Time Skip, look a little closer to his character's age. Also, it moves him visually closer to the older version of his character in A New Hope, who also has a beard.
-   _Avengers: Infinity War_ shows Steve Rogers with a beard after his time on the run after the Sokovia Accords. Doubles as a Beard of Sorrow, given his more grim demeanor after the breakup of the Avengers.

-   _Crashing_: Referenced in one of Pete's go-to bits. He talks about how he can't grow a beard, so if he were ever stranded on a desert island for years, he would look like he'd just arrived there to his eventual rescuers. They'd assume that he just couldn't wait to wear a loin cloth.
-   Used in the series finale of _Crazy Ex-Girlfriend_ to indicate a Time Skip at the end of the episode. The episode primed the pump early by having the character mention growing a beard, but lamenting that it took him "six months" to grow one, then drove the point home really hard when the beard was revealed and another character said (paraphrased), "Wow, it took you six months to grow that."
-   A ninth-season episode of _CSI_ features an inversion in the form of multiple cases at the same motel, all occurring within a year of each other.

-   _Star Trek: Voyager_:
    -   Averted with Chakotay in "Resolutions", which according to Word of God they later regretted, as Chakotay spent months on the planet, but as this takes place within a single episode, it isn't obvious to the audience.

    Video Games 

-   In _Banjo-Kazooie_, Gobi the Camel runs away to find the Lava World after Banjo and Kazooie jump on him to water a giant flower in Click Clock Wood. When Banjo and Kazooie next meet Gobi in _Banjo-Tooie_, Gobi is being held prisoner as an exhibit in Witchyworld's Cave of Horrors and has grown a gray beard from being imprisoned for two years.
-   In _Crusader Kings_, your character's portrait ages as the years pass (specifically, it shifts an age category higher at thirty and fifty years old, gaining wrinkles in the former and white hair in the latter).

-   During the extended story mode of _Fable_ the Hero grows a long beard during their ship ride to the Northern waste.

-   _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_ has a short scene in the epilogue where Eliwood and Hector meet up several years after the events of the main plot, with Hector having grown one of these. By _Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade_, which takes place over a decade later, it's grown even longer.

At the end of the first Jurassic Park levels, Muldoon and Gennaro try to reach the helicopter that's leaving the island only to arrive late and Nedry flees from the _Dilophosaurus_ by sticking a piece of chicken in its mouth. Then in the Jurassic World levels, we see that Muldoon, Gennaro, and Nedry have been living in Isla Nublar for the next 22 years, living in the old Visitor Center and sleeping in one of the Jeeps. Complete with big grey beards, but their character models are otherwise unchanged, including their hair.
-   In _Max Payne 3_, Max and his iconic Beard of Sorrow happen to be an example of this. He has some stubble in the first chapter and sports a full beard by Chapter 7, roughly a week and a half later. Passos counts as well, since he bears full facial hair in the first chapter but can be seen with a more modest amount of scruff when he meets with Max in Hoboken several weeks prior.
-   _Poker Night 2_ parodies it with the Necronomicon ending — all of the other characters Faked Rip Van Winkle the player and wears long white fake beards — including Claptrap, a robot.
-   _Red Dead Redemption II_ has dynamic facial hair growth mechanics. Arthur has ten different lengths for his beard as opposed to the seven for his hair, and almost every single one can be cut into a fashion to the player's liking, such as mustaches and goatees. His facial hair will also instantly grow by a few lengths following time skips.
-   _Rival Schools_: One of _United By Fate_'s good endings depicts President Roy Bromwell with one 20 years after the game's events — complete with Hot-Blooded Sideburns.
-   The main male character's beard (or lack thereof) can help you navigate the timeline in _Telling Lies_.
-   _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_ advertised its dynamic beard growth mechanics. Which is to say, Geralt's beard actually grows over time until it hits a max length (although you can shave it, at which point it starts growing from the beginning again).

Gwonam was only out for a month.
-   In one scene in the "Blood Gulch Chronicles" of _Red vs. Blue_, Church spends a thousand years standing in a hallway waiting for a computer to fabricate a teleporter (...maybe). By the end of it, Church has a massive beard drawn on his sprite. Played for laughs, given he's in a robotic body at this point. Developer commentary revealed that at they wanted the computer involved in the scene to have one too, for Rule of Funny. They ultimately decided against it, citing it as _too_ ridiculous for the storyline at hand.

-   _The Fairly OddParents!_:
    -   The episode "The Boss of Me" has Timmy's Dad and his boss Ed Leadly grow long beards after testing the ever-lasting pencil Timmy wished for to determine if it truly can't be used up.

    -   In "Invasion of the Idiot Dog Brain", GIR is accidentally uploaded into Zim's base computer, trapping Zim in the house and quickly driving him crazy with his antics. Zim decides to wait GIR out, only for a quick Time Skip of _a year_ showing he's still stuck in the house and has grown a beard (despite the fact that Irkens don't normally have hair).
    -   In "Future Dib", Dib gets trapped in a cage by Zim. The end of the episode shows that he's still stuck there, now having grown a full grey beard.

-   The hero of _Samurai Jack_ grows one in the fifty years between seasons 4 and 5. But otherwise doesn't age. Lampshaded by Aku

-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Parodied in the episode "Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade", when Homer and Bart spend day after day sitting on the couch watching TV. Bart grows _a stubble of his own_.
    -   Many other episodes, when Homer spends a lot of time waiting or doing nothing, have his stubble growing into a beard (visually indicated by it getting a bit fuzzy).
-   Averted in _The Smurfs (1981)_ episode "Smurf Van Winkle", where the only characters seen with any Time Passage Beards are the Smurfs that claim that Lazy has slept for a few hundred years. The whole thing was a Faked Rip Van Winkle, since the Smurfs were wearing fake beards.
-   _South Park_: When Cartman (and later Kyle) awakes from a coma, he's got a big beard. But it's just a facewarmer, he's only been out for a day or so.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_:

    -   Parodied in the episode "Pressure". Sandy and Spongebob have a footrace, which Spongebob wins by a lot. When Sandy arrives at the finish line, Spongebob chides her for being slow while wearing a fake beard and speaking in an old man's voice. Afterwards, he rips off the beard.
    -   "Squid on Strike" also has Squidward's Imagine Spot after realizing that he and SpongeBob are on strike "even if it takes _forever!_" (They are in the exact same spots, but are now old, with beards that trail on the ground.)
    -   "Patty Hype" uses this as well. When Spongebob is waiting for customers to come to his burger stand, he repeats the phrase, "I'm ready!" as his present self, a middle-aged man, an elderly man, and a tombstone. Fortunately, it was All Just a Dream.
-   In _The Super Hero Squad Show_ episode "The Saga of Beta Ray Bill", this happens to Thor when he winds up in the abandoned space station. He sits in a corner waiting for someone to show up, and eventually he's sporting a long, full beard, and treating Mjölnir as a Companion Cube.
-   Parodied in the _Tiny Toon Adventures_ episode "Fields of Honey", where Babs is looking for a personal hero in old cartoons.

-   _Total Drama_:
    -   In _Island_, Owen grows a full beard while stranded with nothing but the confessional and Mr. Coconut for company. Hilariously, Heather assumes his beard is fake and tries to rip it off, as it's only been a day, but is taken aback when it doesn't come off.
    -   In _Action_, Owen grows his beard again while lost in the woods for two days. He's not the only one, as Chris is also sporting a beard while waiting for him, Courtney, and Duncan to find their way back to the film lot.
-   Parodied in the _T.U.F.F. Puppy_ episode, "Dog Daze"; Dudley gets fired from T.U.F.F. when Snaptrap hypnotizes him into acting crazy and destroying the Chief's pies, T.U.F.F. Headquarters, and the carnival. When Kitty discovers the hypnotic email on Dudley's computer, she sets out to find Dudley, and when she finds him, he has a beard. Kitty points out that Dudley has only been gone for 20 minutes and is in a crowded coffee shop, then asks him if his beard is real. Dudley tells her that his beard is fake but came with the latte he bought.
-   In the _Wander over Yonder_ episode "The Waste of Time," a time-stranded Wander and Sylvia take The Slow Path and wait fifty years to get to the point where they can prevent their former selves from ever deciding to time-travel in the first place. The "old" Wander has a beard. This is a particularly odd Invoked example as the same episode revealed that Wander is an extremely Long-Lived, potentially _immortal_ being who hasn't visibly aged in at least a thousand years, and Word of God has it that he was wearing a fake beard to make Sylvia feel better about getting old.
-   _We Bare Bears_: In "Rooms", Panda stumbles across an amateur film that Grizz made called _Crowbar Jones_, in which he also plays a nerdy, whiny caricature of Panda called "Pando".

-   Spoofed in the _Yin Yang Yo!_ episode "Finding Hershel", Master Yo instructs Yin and Yang to watch a seemingly-harmless rock named Hershel for their training. After an unspecified amount of time, the twins started to grow beards. Growing impatient, Yang rips off his beard in frustration while Yin shaves hers off while complaining.
-   Parodied on _Zig & Sharko_. After waiting for some time, Sharko and Marina both end up growing these, and they are a shark and a mermaid woman respectively.
