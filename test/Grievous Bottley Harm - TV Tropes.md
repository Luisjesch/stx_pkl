Not even Tintin is immune to having a bottle broken over his head!

_"I think it's time I cracked open this bottle!"_

As one of the standard Improvised Weapons for the Bar Brawl, it makes sense that bottles have a certain special place in the world of weapons. Getting hit with one is actually fairly damaging due to the way they are constructed, and it's fairly easy to inflict serious head injuries on people (if not actually _kill_ someone) with them. The fact that they come with a ready-made grip at the neck doesn't hurt either.

Many of these end up falling under the Soft Glass rule and shatter easily when they likely wouldn't in real life, (beer bottles, in particular, are actually rather hard to break without a lot of force and knowhow due to how thick the glass is; indeed, most beer bottles are tougher than most people's skulls,) though this aspect of them is occasionally subverted comically. Some people in Real Life expect bottles to break as easily as they do in movies and wind up with either a whole bottle or a handful of glass shards. In short, instead of breaking when swung, a bottle can make for a rather durable club if thick enough.

This trope also often overlaps with the Sinister Shiv trope, because there's a common and more intimidating variation where the wielder will deliberately break the bottle on something hard first, leaving a half-bottle with the base end now made up of a _lot_ of broken glass shards, perfect for shanking and stabbing. Again, Real Life applications of such are highly impractical, since not only are real bottles a lot harder to break, if one does attempt to bust one open for their makeshift shiv and succeed, they'll most likely destroy the entire bottle outright instead of the pointy half-bottle they were going for. Smashing a beer bottle into a bar table is more likely to break _the table_ than the bottle. There's also the risk of the bottle-smasher getting hit with glass shrapnel, making this potentially counterproductive.

In Comedy, they might attempt this with a _plastic_ bottle; needless to say it doesn't break (or shatter like glass).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

For all you beginning bar brawlers, you're generally better off hitting people with an intact bottle (if empty — we did mention some beer bottles are harder than most people's skulls, right?), or, if they're full and you have a good arm, _throwing them_.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

When you use the person instead of the bottle to attack, it's Grievous Harm with a Body. When you have a bottle full of petrol with a wick, it's a Molotov Cocktail. When a non-improvised weapon is intentionally formed out of glass, it's Glass Weapon. Can be an example of Bizarre Beverage Use if the bottle is full.

    Literature 

-   _Callahan's Crosstime Saloon_: Mike Callahan has been known to throw a beer bottle at customers from time to time. Luckily, it's made of foam rubber.
-   _Confess, Fletch_, one of Gregory McDonald's eleven _Fletch_ novels. The title character arrives in an apartment he's using as part of a housing swap to find a beautiful woman has been murdered there. With no evident murder weapon and the girl clearly dead, he pours himself a bottle of whiskey from the buffet nearby and calls the police. Unfortunately for Fletch, the whiskey bottle was the murder weapon and was placed in the open so that he might incriminate himself. Police have a hard time figuring it out at first, as an open bottle would have made a much less effective murder weapon given that it might break. This is seen as more damning evidence that Fletch was trying to keep the murder weapon out of play by opening it for a drink.
-   _Death and The Joyful Woman_ by Ellis Peters: Alfred Armiger is done to death with the (full, unopened) magnum of champagne with which he was about to celebrate his latest triumph.
-   In _Different Seasons'_ "The Body," it's mentioned that Chris Chambers once turned up at school with a large bandage wrapped around his head after his father hit him with a Rheingold bottle.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   A variant turns up in _Night Watch_ — Vimes notes that unless you know how to break a bottle properly, instead of a weapon you get a hand full of glass shards and a lot of bleeding. He uses this to his advantage while attempting to avert a riot, making sure the crowd sees an "amateur bottle fighter" hurt himself while Vimes' hands are both occupied with innocent tasks (a cup of cocoa and a cigar), then offers medical assistance.  
        He also mentions to the crowd, while helping the injured man, that he saw someone try this trick against a less generous opponent. The guy reached down and squeezed the afflicted hand. This gets a groan of morbid appreciation. Earlier in the series, broken bottles have also been referenced as "Morpork knives", bar-fighting practically being the "lower" city's civic sport.
    -   In _Maskerade_, Mrs. Plinge tries to knock Nanny Ogg out with a full magnum bottle of champagne. This normally would have worked just fine, and it does give Mrs. Plinge some time to run off. However, there's some Dwarfish ancestry in the Ogg line, and Nanny quickly recovers.
-   The Gamebook _Famous and Rich_ gives you the option of trying to fight off some kidnappers with a bottle, but it just goes from mentioning you attacking your assailants to waking up from unconsciousness later. Guess it didn't work.
-   In H. G. Wells' _The History of Mr. Polly_, Polly breaks a wine bottle over the head of the villainous Uncle Jim, who comments, "Bolls? \[sic\] Fightin' with Bolls? I'll show 'im fightin' with bolls'!" He then breaks two bottles to use as daggers, a skill he had learned in a reformatory home.
-   _Iron Fist_: The more common unrealistic treatment is averted. At the beginning of the novel, agents of a rogue warlord stage a fight in order to get the Wraiths out in the open. To start it, a real bottle is used to hit one of the pilots over the head, and it does not break. (The victim survives without permanent injury, but Tap on the Head is averted; he spends about a week and a half on medical leave with a concussion.) Later, when the Wraiths are using that trick on another world, one of them uses a stage-glass bottle against one of their own, which does break.

-   In _Up Periscope_ by Robb White, the hero is a frogman who is sneaking into a Japanese encampment during a drinking party. When a Japanese officer comes to close the hero uses a bottle of sake, that he found in the hands of an unconscious soldier as a mace. In this case, the hero swung sideways rather than overhand, because that was the only way to hit a scar on the Japanese officers head, and the hero was actually trying to kill him lest his presence be revealed. In this variation, it was war rather than a Bar Brawl.
-   In Fred Vargas' _Wash This Blood Clean From My Hand_, when Fabre insults Retancourt, Adamsberg takes a bottle of wine from Danglard's bag, breaks it on a table's corner and threatens Fabre with the broken gullet to get him to apologise. The violence doesn't go any further on Adamsberg's side, as he soon drops the gullet and walks away... only for Fabre to grab the broken bottle and stab Adamsberg in the arm with it. Adamsberg remains pretty much unflappable through the whole thing.
-   In the Indian novel _The White Tiger_: How Balram kills Ashok.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the early going of _Ash vs. Evil Dead_, Ash ends up having to use an empty beer bottle to defend himself. Unsurprisingly, it's even less effective against Deadites than normal human opponents, as it takes hitting the Deadite hard enough to shatter the bottle (which only pisses it off) and stabbing it in the neck "about fifty times" (which only pisses it off more and gets blood _everywhere_) before he starts getting results, and even then he had to finish it off by getting a truck to smash its head in. His sidekick Pablo is not at all reassured when Ash hands him said bottle when they prepare to fight another Deadite.
-   _The Book of Boba Fett_: In "The Gathering Storm" a Trandoshan tries to stop the Wookie Krrsantan from beating the stuffing out of his fellow Trandoshan by busting a bottle over the Wookie's head.

-   _Doona! (2023)_: A schoolmate of Won-jun's begins harassing him. Doo-na steps in waving a wine bottle. The bully threatens her to actually hit him, and she swings — though Won-jun is able to stop it from escalating to bloody murder with a motorcycle helmet.

-   _FBI: Most Wanted_: In "Chains", Hana is attempting to sneak up on Heather Wallace when Heather spins around and smashes a bottle over her head.
-   _Get Smart_: Max pretends to go on the bottle so he'll be recruited by KAOS. To help sell the premise, CONTROL stocks the bar with breakaway bottles so Max can hit Da Chief over the head with one when Chief comes in to try to get Max to go on the wagon. They do it, but the KAOS agent doesn't notice. So they move closer to him and do it again, and the KAOS agent still doesn't notice. They're out of breakaway bottles so Max orders a big bottle of champagne: he plans to break the bottle on the bar and threaten the Chief with the shards. But slamming the bottle on the bar just makes a hole in the bar.

-   Subverted humorously **twice** in an episode of _Happy Days_ — once when Ralph attempts to break a bottle against a bar, only to be left with an intact bottle and a hole in the bar; and later in that same episode when he attempts to pick up a soda bottle only to have it fall apart in his hand.
-   The British sketch show _Harry and Paul_ has a series of parody ads with Nelson Mandela selling stuff. In one ad he sells _Nelson Mandela's Organic Fighting beer_.

At the end of the episode, Psycho Paul enters his flat and pulls out his screwdriver to scare Moz into giving him his stash of drugs. Moz then proceeds to pick up his own drink, hold it up, and confidently tell Psycho Paul, "I don't fear nowt," and slam his drink into his head... Scrunching the flimsy plastic cup up against his forehead while he gets covered in half a pint of beer. He quickly drops the act.
-   In an episode of _Laverne & Shirley_, one of the gang brings in some prop-bottles from a movie set and everyone has fun smashing them over each other's head.

In another episode, one of the victims gets done in by having wine-bottles _catapulted_ onto him (he'd been drugged first so croquet hoops could be securely affixed into the ground over his arms and legs to keep him from moving before the murderer woke him up again).
-   _Motive_: The Victim of the Week in "Pilot Error" is cracked over the head with a bottle, which — unusually for this trope — does not shatter on impact. The blow does not kill her but knocks her out. She dies when the killer, thinking she is dead, hides her in the deep freeze.

-   _My Name Is Earl_, Joy threatens Catalina:
    
    **Joy:** You're not the one holdin' a freshly broken bottle, now are you!

    -   They did an entire show about the effectiveness of the bottle as a weapon, and their tests showed that a full beer bottle does significantly more damage to the brain than an empty one. They were going to hit Adam (in a helmet) at first until they discovered that the force applied was enough to cause a concussion, so they used gelatin brains instead. After declaring the "empty bottle being more damaging" myth busted, Jamie and Adam broke sugar glass bottles over each other's heads. (As in the previous examples, they had trouble breaking the bottles against a football helmet early in the episode, and Adam pointed out that those types of bottles are _meant to be shipped long distances_, so they _had_ to be relatively strong.)

-   The Stewart/Colbert/O'Brien Mêlée à Trois includes a scene where all three smash Soft Glass beer bottles over each other's heads — this is where the Stewart-Colbert alliance breaks up and it becomes a true Mêlée à Trois, as Jon accidentally breaks a bottle over Stephen.

-   On Dec. 11, 2020, Carmella smashed a wine bottle over Sasha Banks.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Deadlands_: Given the setting's pastiche, it had to happen. A bottle is stated in one rule book or the other as a small club, which does the attacker's _Strength_ plus 1d4 damage. If the bottle were to break, it would presumably become a small knife instead, doing... the attacker's _Strength_ plus 1d4 damage.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: The Drunken Master Prestige Class has a class feature that lets it use anything as a weapon. Frequently, the Drunken Master will be holding a bottle.
-   An intact bottle is a weak club in _GURPS_ and a broken one is the equivalent of a small knife.
-   _New World of Darkness_, in the book _Armory_, gives rules for attacking with a bottle. It breaks if you do more than two damage with it, changing it from Bashing to Lethal... and then that shatters if you do more than two damage with _it_, rendering it worthless. (It also takes a skill roll to break it _intentionally_, and if you fail, your hand is a mess.)
-   In _Pathfinder_, those of the Alchemist class add their INT bonus on any splash weapons they use; this applies principally to their bombs, but also affects any acid flasks, bottles of alchemist's fire, etc. that they make or purchase. In a pinch, they can also use anything nearby, including bottles, as improvised thrown weapons.

-   In _Machinal_, the protagonist's lover tells her about the time he was kidnapped by bandits in the hills of Mexico and got the two men guarding him drunk, filled an empty bottle with small stones off the ground and killed them with it. "I had to get free, didn't I?", he explains, and this phrase weighs heavily on her mind when she decides to murder her husband using the same method.

    Video Games 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   In the second game's third case, a bottle is used as a weapon, but it's not the murder weapon and just leaves the victim with a concussion. It, however, broke. It was probably made from cheaper glass than Phoenix's favorite brand of grape juice. Later on in the same case, it's possible to bait Maya into hitting Phoenix with a plastic bottle that, of course, does not break.
    -   In the first case in _Apollo Justice_, the victim hits a waitress over the head with a glass grape juice bottle, and knocks her out. (Yes, despite what you're all thinking, it was really grape juice, even in the Japanese original.) Later, the victim is killed with a hit from another bottle, which does _not_ break, and the unbroken bottle becomes evidence.
-   The most common weapon in _Action Doom 2: Urban Brawl_. In fact, the very first weapon you get in the game is a bottle of Jack Daniels the player character drinks to reduce his sensitivity to pain and then uses as a weapon.
-   _ANNO: Mutationem_: When Ann is witnessing a Pensieve Flashback to when she attempted to talk Ryan out of joining a street gang, one of the members retaliated by tossing a bottle at her. This awakened Amok who was dormant inside of her and attacked everyone present.
-   _Batman: Arkham City_
    -   The Penguin's<small>◊</small> monocle isn't actually a real monocle, but rather the bottom of a beer bottle that was violently shoved into his face during a bar fight.
    -   Some inmates use broken bottles as weapons. They behave just like inmates with knives, but they aren't as common or as easy to spot.
-   _The Battle Cats_: Adult Cat attacks by tossing a bottle at enemies.
-   _Beyond A Steel Sky_: Robert takes care of Jimmy by hitting him over his head with an empty bottle.
-   _Bubble Bobble_ has Drunks as enemies that throw bottles, and Willy Whistle throws entire waves of bottles.
-   Natasha from _Commandos_ can knock out enemy soldiers with wine bottles. Other commandos don't need a bottle for this, ostensibly because they're stronger, but the real reason is for game balancing. It's also the reason the bottles always break after one use, Hollywood style.
-   Sakura Ogami's death in _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_ involves her being subjected to this. Twice. _With enough force to shatter said bottle each time._ She **still** lives after this and later commits suicide via drinking poison. Of course, she _is_ a titanic mountain of muscles. You could probably hit her with a whole case of bottles and she'd still be fine afterwards.
-   _Déjà Vu (1985)_: There is a bottle you can get at the beginning of the game that can be broken and used as a weapon. However, there is no reason to use it in the game and only allows you more ways to get a game over.
-   In the City Elf origin story for _Dragon Age: Origins_, a nobleman tries to interrupt the PC's wedding, leading to the PC's cousin driving him off by breaking a bottle on his head. He comes back later with armed mooks to kidnap a number of women from the wedding, including two bridesmaids, the cousin who knocked him out earlier, and either the PC or his bride, depending on which gender the player chose for the PC.
-   _Fallen Aces_ grants you glass bottles for smashing enemy heads. It's slightly more effective as a melee weapon compared to the other option, _pipes_, especially after the bottle is broken with sharp edges.
-   _Fighting Force_ has breakable bottles for the player to use against enemies.
-   EA's adaptation of _The Godfather II_ actually uses a bottle thrown to the head as a required kill condition for a rival family's made man.
-   _Gang Wars_: Glass bottles are one of the first pickups players can use to smash them in mooks' faces.
-   _God of War_ has an alternate costume called The Dairy Bastard, which puts Kratos in a cow suit — and replaces his Chaos Blades with gallon milk jugs. Since the animations remain the same, Kratos can use them to fatally stab things.
-   _Grand Theft Auto V_ added a broken bottle as a melee weapon in the Beach Bum Update.
-   _Grim Fandango_: In Year 2, Meche ruins Manny's chance of getting on board the ship she is leaving on by throwing a bottle at him. When the two are reunited a year later, Manny can't resist commenting on that.
-   _Hotline Miami_: an empty bottle can be used by Jacket. Oddly enough, it's a throwing weapon only.
-   The execrable _Human Killing Machine_ for the Amiga is a bad ripoff of _Street Fighter_ in the guise of a Spiritual Successor, and featured a cast full of bad racial stereotypes. This included Franz, a German waiter who went into fights while balancing a wineglass and bottle on a tray at all times and whose attacks consisted of flinging bottles of wine at Kwon, the protagonist.
-   Wine bottles appear as one of the many Improvised Weapons in _Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb_. Indy has the option of either wielding them as makeshift bludgeons or throwing them. Either way, they make surprisingly effective weapons. Once.

-   _Johnny Rocketfingers_: In the first game, Johnny can decide to assault the woman asking for his help with a bottle, which ends with him getting shot by the cops. In the second game, Johnny makes the first move against the gangsters surrounding him by using a broken bottle as a weapon.
-   In _Kingdom of Loathing_, the drunken half-orc hobo has a bottle of Mad Train Wine as one of his weapons. It doesn't mention the bottle breaking on impact, but it may return a message about there being too much blood in your broken-glass-stream. If you're fighting a hobo found while dumpster-diving, he explicitly grabs a broken bottle. In the 2013 class revamps Disco Bandits learned a skill that lets them summon an improvised knife once per day, and one of the possible weapons you can get from this skill is a broken bottle.
-   You can often throw bottles in LEGO adaptation games. In fact, in _LEGO Indiana Jones_, doing so is a part of the first fight with Belloq in the mountain bar.
-   A common weapon to find in street fights in the _Like a Dragon_ series, which can be used as either bludgeoning or throwing weapons. A particularly nasty Heat move has Kiryu stab a mook with a broken bottle before kneeing it deeper into the man's body when he tries to recover.
    -   During Majima's fight with Nishikiyama in _Yakuza 0_, Reina tries to help by breaking a wine bottle over Majima's head. Failing the Quicktime Event sees her knock a chunk of Majima's health off, and "earns" the player a trophy.
    -   During Ryuji's introduction cutscene in _Yakuza 2_ and its remake, he punishes a mook who called him "The Dragon of Kansai" by breaking a bottle over his head and threatening him with the remainder. When Kiryu does the same and prepares to leave, another goon tries to hit him with a bottle as well. Kiryu shrugs it off before pitching the goon over a railing and into a piano.
-   One of Kano's Fatalities in _Mortal Kombat 11_ has him smash a bottle of alcohol after taking a brief pull from it, at which point he drives it into his victim's neck.
-   After the shipwreck at the beginning of _Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir_, you can salvage broken bottles from the wreckage of the _Vigilant_ to use as weapons against the batiri that want to eat you. Mechanically they work like a basic, unenchanted dagger.
-   _PAYDAY 2_ has the Rivertown Glen Bottle, Bonnie's melee weapon of choice.
-   Older Than the NES: In the old _Popeye_ game, both Bluto and the Sea Hag can throw bottles at Popeye that the player can avoid and gain points by punching.
-   _The Punisher_ for the Xbox subverts this. Thrown beer bottles hurt... oddly just as much as a bullet to the chest (on easy mode).
-   Soft Glass is Averted in _Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army_, when Raidou hits Rasputin, who's an android, over the head with a bottle. Rasputin ends up knocked out cold and the bottle doesn't break.
-   Some of the Majini in _Resident Evil 5_ wield bottles as melee weapons.
-   In _Rise of the Tomb Raider_, Lara can pick up bottles lying around and throw them to cause a distraction. However, if she knows the "Deadly Force" skill which allows for faster stealth takedowns, and she does a takedown with a bottle in her hand, she'll use the bottle to kill the enemy. There's even an achievement for it.
-   Jet Li's _Rise To Honor_ encourages this, as it is effectively a Hong Kong Martial Arts Movie in video game form. Kit Yun can transfer bottles from the floor to his hand with a single deft flick of his foot, then bash enemy Mooks with it. Only good for one hit, but it takes out any non-boss enemy after a single smash and when bottles are available, they're plentiful.
-   _Saints Row 2_: In the second mission, the protagonist is sitting in a bar watching the news, when a gang member comes by and has the TV turned off. The protagonist says he/she was watching that, and the gang member replies "I guess you're not anymore, are ya bitch?" The main character sits quietly for a moment, then casually grabs a beer bottle and backhands it across the gang members face, knocking him out instantly. Note also that Boss takes the gang member's bottle, and then _goes back to drinking their own_.
-   _Samurai Shodown_: Haohmaru uses a sake jug as his version of a Hurricane Kick. It stuns enemies and doesn't break.
-   Bottles are one of the many weapons you can use in _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game_. They don't break upon use, which means you can throw them and abuse the juggling properties thrown weapons have against mooks.
-   _Sharpshooter 3D_ allows you to pick up bottles in several areas for smashing mooks in their craniums. After landing a few hits, the bottle breaks turning it into a stabbing weapon. You can also throw them as a ranged attack if you want.
-   Win a duel against an Annoying Captain in a bar in _Sid Meier's Pirates! 2004_ and the barmaid is the one who will end the fight...by angrily walloping your opponent over the head with a bottle of wine.
-   Another example is the wine bottle weapon in _Silent Hill 4_. True to form, it eventually breaks and changes from a clubbing weapon to a stabbing weapon after repeated use.
-   _Smite_: Maman Brigitte doesn't hit her enemy with the bottle directly, but when she can slam an empty rum bottle to the ground hard enough to create a shockwave that damages and stuns enemies around her as part of her "Party Trick" ability, she doesn't need to.
-   _Skull & Crossbones_: Occasionally, you'll be assaulted by pirate enemies who hurls empty bottles at a distance. Getting hit by those bottles result in as much health loss as being hit by a sword.
-   In the _Streets of Rage_ series, you could pick up and break a bottle to use as a weapon.
-   In _Team Fortress 2_ the Demoman uses an intact bottle of cider as his default melee weapon. When taunting with the bottle in hand, he drinks. If the bottle strikes something with a Critical Hit it breaks as per this trope, though the effect is purely cosmetic. This doesn't make any difference to the taunt animation, as he drank out of the broken bottle, presumably too drunk to tell the difference. Due to the use of the same animations he can also appear to be drinking from _a frying pan_ and various other melee weapons as well. Some of these were eventually fixed but the frying pan one was kept around because it was funny.
    -   A humorous and widely popular fan-made mod turns the Demoman's Grenade Launcher into The Scottish Reserve, a crate full of scrumpy. This makes the Demoman attack by chucking bottles of booze at enemies and has him reload by taking swigs from the bottle he's currently holding. It also raises questions of what's in those bottles that is both drinkable yet highly explosive. (Ryncol?)
-   Marshall Law's _Tekken 4_ ending has Law assault one of his restaurant's patrons for complaining about the food. Another patron retaliates by breaking a bottle over Law's head. It does little more than piss him off.
-   In _Urban Reign_ glass bottles can be thrown at enemies or clubbed over their heads. Doing this, or dropping them, breaks the bottle and converts it into a slashing weapon.
-   _The Warriors_: One of the many items that can be picked up and used as a weapon in the video game adaptation. The brutality of hitting someone with a bottle is usually accented, so the game partially subverts the Soft Glass trope.
-   In _World of Warcraft_ the "Barman Shanker" is a broken bottle, looted from a bartender in one of the (at the time) higher level dungeons. It is easier to get than anything from raids, and its damage-over-time effect was situationally useful. Most importantly, it was _cool_ to carry around a broken bottle as a dagger.
    -   The seasonal boss Coren Direbrew also drops a shattered bottle that functions as a dagger.
    -   On a less serious note, some drinks leave a bottle behind after their use. You can sell them for a copper to vendors... or chuck them at other players.
-   In _Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus,_ Rip Blascowitz takes several ceramic vases to the face, which only give him _a little nick in his cheek_ IF you manage to smash him accross the gob with your last one. One alone should have put him in the hospital from either blunt-force head trauma, Eye Scream, or both (presumably, sheer adrenaline lets young BJ throw/swing them hard enough to break), if not killed him outright.

Spoony as The Avatar attempts this with a whiskey bottle on Lord British (played by Richard Garriott himself) after being stiffed by him one too many times, but seeing as Lord British is Nigh-Invulnerable as in the games the most it does is bounce off with a "ping" and he doesn't even notice.

    Real Life 

-   In bar fights in Germany (including the Oktoberfest), sometimes beer steins are used instead of bottles. That's why the makers of those introduced predetermined breaking points - hit someone with a stein, and the grip will break off, reducing the chance of really bad injuries.
-   The "bottles" seen in the movies are in fact dedicated props that are typically made of hardened wax. This wax looks exactly like thick glass, can hold liquid, and breaks satisfyingly but doesn't hurt the actors as much as real glass. (Bottles can _also_ be made of the same sugary stuff used for breakaway window-panes, but this is unusual because sugar-glass shatters and can cause injury.)
-   On one occasion when Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison were at the same club, Morrison, in typical fashion, started acting like a drunken idiot and Joplin proceeded to hit him in the face with a Southern Comfort bottle.
