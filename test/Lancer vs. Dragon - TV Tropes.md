They may not be The Hero or the Big Bad, but that doesn't stop them from throwing fists when the time comes.

This trope happens when The Lancer and The Dragon of a story face off against each other in a direct fight. Since they're not the focus of the story it can happen almost any time, although if it occurs during the climax, expect to see their fight interspersed with the main showdown between the hero and villain. Also, since both characters lack the superior Plot Armor of protagonist and antagonist, their duel can be more suspenseful since neither is guaranteed to survive. It often occurs as a part of The Rest Shall Pass scenario, especially in cases when it happens several times until only the hero remains. In such instances, it is almost guaranteed the Lancer and the Dragon will be the last ones left behind before The Hero confronts the Big Bad.

Contrast with It's Personal with the Dragon, where The Hero is the one who is fighting The Dragon.

Compare/contrast Designated Girl Fight.

Interestingly, _both_ the lancer and dragon in this film are Leader Wannabes, which seems to be intentional.
-   _Dragon Ball_ changed up the Lancer several times, in order:

    -   After Tien's Heel–Face Turn, he became the new Lancer and faced the Demon King Piccolo's Dragon Tambourine.

    -   The movies did this a bit more, Piccolo fought Salza in 5, Vegeta destroyed Android 15 in 7.
-   _Fairy Tail_ largely averts this, with Erza Scarlet instead being typically the one to take down the arc villain's Dragon, but the Tenrou Island arc and the Alvaraz plays it straight, with Grey Fullbuster being the one to defeat Ultear Milkovich, one of Hades' Co-Dragons, and Invel, Zeref's Chief-of-Staff.

    -   Inverted in the Kaiba Corp Grand Prix arc. The Arc Villain Zigfried duels Joey and Kaiba at different points, defeating the former and losing to the latter. His Dragon and little brother Leon duels Yugi in the arc's climax and is beaten.
