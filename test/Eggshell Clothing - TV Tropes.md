It's the latest in hats this season.

_"Snorlax is pretty lazy... but Togepi hatched, got halfway out of his shell and just said, 'Fuck it.'"_

A creature only partially hatches from an egg, and walks around with the remaining eggshell on him/her as though it was normal. It could be as little as wearing part of the shell as a hat, or as much as an egg with feet poking out.

Reasons for this are usually either Rule of Funny or Rule of Cute.

A Sub-Trope of Artistic License – Biology, Appropriate Animal Attire, and Improvised Clothes. Related to Edible Theme Clothing if the yolk and white are worn.

Contrast Removable Shell (the shell that's supposed to stay on can come off). Compare Egg Folk, where the egg _is_ the creature in question.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Pippo from _Doraemon: Nobita and the Steel Troops_ is a chick hatched from a robotic shell, and wears part of his shell as a hat.
-   Many Digimon. Digitamamon takes it to the extreme, with a complete eggshell body and cracks for legs and eye slits. He can leap at an enemy and close all the cracks to basically use himself as a _battering ram._ (In case you're wondering, Digitamamon has a pocket universe in there. His attack is to pull you in for a few seconds. It is called Nightmare Syndrome. We saw the inside briefly and it goes on _forever,_ and there's still no sign of what the Digitamamon's whole body within the egg looks like.) There's a so-far-cardgame-only _evil_ version named Devitamamon with a head made of monstrous jaws and too many eyes coming out of the eye slot.
-   In _Kamisama Minarai: Himitsu no Cocotama_ and the rest of the _Cocotama_ franchise, the Cocotamas wear white pants with a zig-zagged/curvy edge that are supposed to look like eggshells, since the Cocotamas hatch from eggs.
-   Mikken, the chicken from the _Kyoro-chan_ anime, wears a pair of pants that look like part of an eggshell. Whether they are made from his actual egg is unknown.
-   _Sanrio_: Shakipiyo, a character associated with Gudetama, is a chick who wears half a pink eggshell as pants.

    Comic Books 

-   A character in the (pretty dark) comic book series _Gaspard de la nuit_ is an unhatched egg save two duck-like legs sticking out from holes in the bottom. The character at one point explains that it hasn't fully hatched because it is afraid of the world outside.

        -   Averted with the Yoshi Kid from _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_, where his diaper/shorts only have a similar polka-dot pattern as a Yoshi egg.
    -   The Dino Piranha (and Fiery Dino Piranha) boss in _Super Mario Galaxy_ exhibit the "egg with feet" aspect of this trope until you deliver the first hit and crack the shell.
    -   Peewee Piranha, the first boss in _Super Mario Galaxy 2_.
-   Initially, the Moon Hamachao from the "Moonfish" sidequest of _Skies of Arcadia: Legends_ — until you feed it enough Moonfish that it grows out of it.

    -   Most of Togepi's body is covered in the shell of the egg it hatched from. Its evolved forms Togetic and Togekiss have patterns on their body that match the one on Togepi's shell.
    -   Vullaby may also look like this at a glance since it's a baby vulture, but it's actually wearing a skull as a diaper.
-   Egbert from _World of Warcraft_ is a pet you can get in the game. The egg covers the center part of his body.

    Western Animation 

-   Done in a couple of _Looney Tunes_ shorts.
    -   In one called "The Shell-Shocked Egg", a turtle egg gets separated and wanders around trying to hatch, and when he does he complains that he's still in a shell.
    -   In another one called "Booby Hatched", a duck egg tries to find a place to get warm. The mother duck finds it and saves it from being boiled; as she picks him out of the pot, the duckling hatches and shouts "Aw, ma! Just when I was getting warm!" and jumps back in.
-   In _The Penguins of Madagascar_ episode "Paternal Egg-stinct", the duck egg the penguins are taking care of sprouts legs and wanders around the zoo.
-   In _Dexter's Laboratory_, Dee Dee mistakes a turtle for one of these, and then a bird that is one of these for a turtle.

-   In the _U.S. Acres_ segments of _Garfield and Friends_, there is a chick called Sheldon who, unlike his brother Booker, never fully hatched out of his shell and wears it all the time, with only his legs sticking out. In one episode the shell cracked and fell off, only to reveal that he had another shell underneath it. In other episodes, it's hinted that the inside of his shell is like a whole room to him, and he even once attempted to hang pictures on his wall (which resulted in his shell partially cracking due to the nails piercing it, but it didn't come off nor did any part of him become more visible).
-   In _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_, Ludo gets swallowed by a chicken-like monster and is released as an egg before hatching. He only has his eggshell to cover himself. When it later breaks, it turns out he has a diaper underneath anyway.
