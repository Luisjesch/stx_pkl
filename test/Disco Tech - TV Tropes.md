Technology that heavily involves music, usually either activating things, or somehow being a power source.

**This cannot be music for puzzle solving, or things like that. It has to be technology using music.**

Name is a pun on the term "discotheque".

Magic Music is the magic counterpart to this trope.

Compare The Power of Rock, Band Land.

If the music is used as a weapon, you're looking for Musical Assassin. Not to be confused with Discotek.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Later series in the _Macross_ franchise feature technology powered up or wholy enabled by special "fold waves", which humans and most other races can usualy only generate by singing.
-   _Symphogear_ features ancient power armors that run on "phonic energy", also known as _singing_.
-   _The Legend of Black Heaven_ has an alien super-weapon being powered by Oji's epic rocking.
-   The original version of _Astro Boy_'s Artificial Sun, a giant, floating, octopus-like robot that generates massive amounts of heat, was controlled by playing a keyboard. To activate it you play "You are my sunshine, my only sunshine", naturally. Most subsequent adaptations leave this out for being rather silly.

    Comic Books 

-   In the comic _Grimjack_ in issue #76 he travels to a dimension where sound can be used as a weapon. He, an old friend, and a number of new allies fight to protect "The Heart of Rock" from the evil forces of corporate music. The weapons used are musical instruments. And most of the characters are based on rock musicians.

    Fan Works 

-   Extremely important in _Left Beyond_ for both timelines: in the Millennial Kingdom "wubbers", basically Weirding Module expies, are the setting's replacement for tazers and other nonlethal weapons, while in Tripocalypse it was a sonic weapon that brought the Battle of Armageddon to a halt.
-   Popular Fanon has Vinyl Scratch build and use a "bass cannon", a huge set of speakers that fire a Wave-Motion Gun\-like beam of pure dubstep. It's apparently quite effective, as it was able to defeat Discord with one blast in _"Epic Wub Time"_, a non-canon fan animation. Also, at the beginning of the video, Octavia explains how Vinyl cleans dishes "with _wubs_".
-   _Metal Effect_, a crossover fic between _Brütal Legend_ and _Mass Effect_ replaces the Element Zero of the latter for the Heavy Metal Magic Music of the former, resulting in Magitek starships fuelled by The Power of Rock.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Major Domo in _Captain EO_.
-   Durand Durand's "Orgasmic Organ" in _Barbarella_.
-   Willy Wonka has a door with a musical lock, opened by a piece by Rachmaninoff.
-   _Masters of the Universe_ has the Cosmic Key, a device that is capable to open portals the destination of which depends on the notes that are played on it.
-   _Prometheus_ has alien holographic displays which are somehow controlled through the playing of a flute.

    Literature 

-   Philip José Farmer's _World of Tiers_ books have The Horn of Shambarimen — a musical instrument that acts as a skeleton key for opening gates between worlds.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Killjoys_:
    -   An assassin carries a music-activated lockbox with an antidote to her preferred poison.
    -   The crew minus Johnny have to reboot Lucy, the ship's AI, before disaster strikes. They first try imitating Johnny's voice, then realize the key is a song associated with the night Johnny and Lucy first met while he was trying to steal the ship.
-   The _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "The Paradise Syndrome" features a potentially world-destroying asteroid held at bay by a repulsive field that is controlled through the use of music.
-   In the two-part _Wonder Woman_ episode "Judgment From Outer Space, the alien Andros activates his powers by rubbing an amulet and whistling. His ship also has a whistle-activated lock.

    Video Games 

-   In _Chrono Trigger_, the cathedral of the Middle Ages features doors that can be opened by playing a nearby organ.
-   In _Mother 3_, you can perform combo attacks by pressing the A button to the beat of the battle music. This feature is described in-game as a "sound battle".
-   _Final Fantasy X-2_: Vegnagun's controls are a massive keyboard.
-   _King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella_: Rosella plays a certain tune on the haunted house's pipe organ to get the key to the burial vault.
-   In _Loom_ many actions, properties and abilities (to name a few: opening, night vision, invisibility, sharpness, green color) are reflected as sequences of notes ("drafts") on the magical distaff (hinted to be a Sufficiently Advanced Technology of 9th millennium). When spellweavers play the notes, they duplicate the effect. Oh, and playing a draft backwards gives the opposite effect. This gives the game its unique interface: to perform any action beyond simple goto/pick/examine the hero has to learn the correct draft from somewhere and play it.
-   The Dubstep Gun from _Saints Row IV_ plays music when fired, and causes enemies to dance uncontrollably until they keel over dead.
-   Lucio from _Overwatch_ has a gun that fires soundwaves that either damage enemies or pushes them aside. For his Ultimate ability, he uses it to generate temporary shields for his allies.
-   In the _Ratchet & Clank_ series, the Groovitron is a weapon that's thrown like a grenade. Upon landing, a disco ball pops out, disco music plays, and every single enemy (including vehicles) are compelled to dance. One even gets used on the player during a later boss fight.
-   _No Straight Roads_: Vinyl City is powered by devices called Qwasas, which convert sound waves into electricity. The city's main source of power is the Grand Qwasa, a large device located in Festival Plaza, and artists regularly perform for it to power the city.
-   _Warframe_: The music-themed Warframe Octavia derives her power from the Mandachord, an instrument connected to her elbows that allows players to make their own custom songs, which then have impact on and are played when casting her abilities in missions. A massive, digital version of the Mandachord serves both as the arena and the key to defeating Hunhow in the _Octavia's Anthem_ quest.

    Web Comics 

-   The Andrew Hussie webcomic _And It Don't Stop.<small>◊</small>_ is about robots controlled through rap battles.
-   Agatha Heterodyne, _Girl Genius_, controlled her circus clanks through music.

    Western Animation 

-   There's an episode of _Batman: The Animated Series_ which involves playing the beginning of "Ode To Joy" to unlock the secret room.
-   The girl's voice in _Rock and Rule_ was significant to help Mok with his summoning spell.
-   A Disney _Silly Symphonies_ short "Music Land" involved a _Romeo and Juliet_\-esque romance between the children of rival kingdoms of anthropomorphic musical instruments. This ends up sparking a war where the queen of the Symphony Islands and the king of the Isle of Jazz fire their music as weapons at each others' kingdoms.
-   In the _Spongebob Squarepants_ special "Atlantis Squarepantis", the fact that the Atlanteans have evolved beyond petroleum fuels and use song to power their vehicles instead kicks off the Excuse Plot for the musical.
-   The lost city of Tinnabula from the two-part _TaleSpin_ episode "For Whom the Bell Klangs".
