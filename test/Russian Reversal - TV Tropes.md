Реверс русский для чайников!

_"In America, there's plenty of light beer and you can always find a party!  
In Russia, the Party always finds you."_

In Soviet Russia, Russian Reversal Describes You.

The Russian Reversal, more technically called an antimetabole, is a type of joke popularized by Ukrainian comedian Yakov Smirnoff. It is based on taking a statement about capitalist United States and inverting it to describe the then-communist Russia as a dystopian hellhole. Smirnoff later added the prefix "Soviet" to indicate the jokes were meant to target the past regime, as opposed to The New Russia. For instance:

The political undertone of Smirnoff's original jokes tends to be conspicuously missing from the imitations, leaving the joke as just "it's funny when things are opposite".

At its most basic, the Russian Reversal takes a situation where a noun normally does something to another noun, and flips it in dialogue to where the second noun acts on the first. For instance, a murder mystery that had a butler as the Body of the Week could be described in a Quip to Black as "It Did the Butler" or the equivalent instead of "The Butler Did It."

This trope may also have a linguistic basis, as Russian uses Object-Verb-Subject word order for unusual situations.

Can cause an Inverted Trope rather easily, if the starting trope can be described as "X verbs Y." If in this instance, "Y verbs X," it is both this trope and an inversion of the other trope.

It's also the source of many trope names:

    Comedy laughs at you! 

-   The Trope Namer is Yakov Smirnoff, who made jokes about how the U.S.S.R. had a Big Brother Is Watching regime. It's also a case of Beam Me Up, Scotty!; his most famous line was simply "In Russia...", not "In Soviet Russia..."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  He shifted his comedy after starting his theater in Branson back in 1992 (where he is still playing), which means he quit using this joke long before it became an internet meme.

As a result, they didn't cross the border - "the border crossed _them_."

In other words, Taylor made her power trigger.

-   _MAD_:
    -   In an 1962 issue: "Russian politics can best be understood by comparing them with American politics. For instance, in America, politicians have to kiss babies, and if they don't, the mothers can take their offices away from them. In Russia, the system is somewhat different. To get food, mothers have to kiss politicians and if they don't, the politicians can take their babies away from them."
    -   "When you're down and out, you wait in line at the clinic. When you're just getting by, you wait in line to see your family doctor. When you're making it, you're put first in line to see your family doctor. When you're on top of the heap, your family doctor waits in line to see you."

    -   Mike Myers parodies this on a behind-the-scenes feature on the DVD for _The Cat In The Hat_, combining it with a running joke. "Under capitalism, man exploits his fellow man. Under communism, it's the complete opposite. \*pause\* Because of the sand which is there."
-   _City of Thieves_ mentions this:
    
    "We couldn't feed our pets, so our pets fed us."

-   In R Scott Bakker's _Second Apocalypse_ the Skin Eaters' Banter suggests that in Zeüm the beggars give _you_ money.

When he's back on the ground, he throws a fit and says that he's so small, he can't even fly a kite. Pooh comments that he was just flying one and he replies "No, the kite was flying me."
-   Older Than They Think: _The World Turned Upside Down or The Folly of Man, Exemplified in Twelve Comical Relations Upon Uncommon Subjects_ is an eighteenth-century chapbook (available online here) that uses non-sequitur reversals to satirize the then-current group of political revolutions. The illustrations show such reversals as children raising parents, chickens roasting people, horses riding people, and fish catching people.
-   In one of his SF essays, Stanisław Lem discussed how to get instant SF ideas by noun reversal (OK, so it's not noun-verb, but that would work either). Protip: It's only that easy if you are Stanislaw Lem.
-   E. Nesbit’s Fairy Tale short story “Melisande” hinges on one of these, in which a princess is cured of a crippling case of supernatural Rapid Hair Growth by a prince who winds her hair around a suspended hook and cuts her down as she hangs from it. When asked why this worked, he responds, “You have always cut the hair off the Princess. I just cut the Princess off the hair.” His Insane Troll Logic comes back to bite him when his solution causes the princess herself to grow as quickly as her hair did until she becomes a giant; when she cuts her hair off her head again, she returns to normal size, but the hair grows at the rate it did before. The problem is finally solved by weighing the princess and her hair equally in a large set of scales and cutting the hair in the middle so that neither side knows which to grow.

    -   In _A Hat Full of Sky_, Hiver!Tiffany tells her broomstick "I am not going to learn you, _you_ are going to learn _me_", then says that or else, the next lesson would involve an axe. Its days of aerial acrobatics were over after that.
-   T. S. Eliot's "Choruses" has "Has the Church failed mankind, or has mankind failed the Church?" \[2\]
-   In _The Pigeon Will Ride the Roller Coaster!_, the Pigeon states that the question is not will he be ready for the roller coaster but rather will it be ready for him.

The last one suggests television watching people...which looks exactly like people watching television. The attendee doesn't laugh, but just acts confused.

-   In _Mario Gives Up_, the Optional Boss is introduced with a screen that states, "In Soviet Russia, key uses you!"

-   _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_: During the quest "The Mind of Madness," when talking about Potema Septim, Daedric Prince of Madness Sheogorath mentions he can't remember if she "wielded fear like a cleaver" or "wielded a cleaver and made people afraid".
-   _Fate/Grand Order_: A Servant can qualify for the Foreigner class if they are a visitor from another world. Voyager - the Anthropomorphic Personification of the famous space probe - also qualifies, because the probe was built on Earth and then launched into space to visit other worlds.
-   _A Bite at Freddy's_: _Five Nights at Freddy's_ and many of its fangames have Fredbear biting a kid on the head as a key part of their story. In this game, the reason the Fazbear Grill lost its popularity is because a kid bit _Fredbear_ on the head.

    Web Original make website out of you! 

-   Yakov Smirnoff's "In Soviet Russia" version went memetic long after the fall of communism. The Internet being what it is, these jokes ignored any attempts to make it seem Orwellian in favour of non-sequiturs like "In Soviet Russia, motorcycle rides YOU_!!_"

Wait, that's it! In Soviet Russia, tractor beam will PUSH!
        
    -   Chuck explains how they got the idea for _RoboCop_:
        
        "Edward Neumeier happened to walk past a poster for _Blade Runner_ and asked what it was about. And his friend told him it was about a cop who catches robots. So, Neumeier had an idea. In _Blade Runner_, human cop catches robot. But in _his_ movie, robot cop catches human. And Yakov Smirnoff says, 'Hey, that's my routine! You go find your own!'"
