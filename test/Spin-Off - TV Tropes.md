The Mario gang takes a break from bickering with each other and putter up.

_"Spinoff"! Is there any word more thrilling to the human soul? Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such TV spinoffs as_ Son of Sanford and Son _and_ AfterMannix_._

Spin-Offs are when part of a successful work, usually characters, but sometimes a general concept (first you have the Law, then you have the Order), are taken and given a second show of their own.

From a producer's perspective, it's a chance to explore other aspects of a concept. Actors can find opportunities to grow in their craft, as well as rise in importance by moving from just being part of an ensemble to having a show built around them. For the networks, it's a chance to establish a show with a built-in audience, making it that much easier for them to sell advertising.

Lots of spinoffs go on to be successful shows in their own right, sometimes even surpassing the parent series in popularity. Others crash and burn (_Joanie Loves Chachi_, anyone?), suggesting that there is no such thing as a sure thing. Nevertheless, networks keep trying them.

## There are many different kinds of spinoffs, including:

-   Where a character leaves a show and joins or starts another one, and the two run concurrently. Sometimes called a sister show. Characters may cross over from time to time.
-   Where a show comes to an end and a character from it is given his or her own new show. Provides an opportunity to Retool the character as well.
-   Where a character is brought on to an existing show simply in order to be spun off, hopefully making some of the original audience into viewers of the new show. (See Poorly Disguised Pilot.)
-   The main character is revisited elsewhere in their narrative.
-   Reimaginings — the concept is carried into a new show with the same basic premise but other factors and characters are completely new.
-   Segment spin-offs — a recurring segment from the show becomes the main attraction.
-   A type of Defictionalization — a Show Within a Show gets made into a real show of its own.
-   The storyline on one show comes to an end, only to be continued in a new show with a different name.
-   Official Fanzine Show — a trope usually applying to Reality TV, usually offering Behind The Scenes info or coverage that wouldn't fit into the main programme, often (but not always) broadcast immediately after the main show, on a sister channel.
-   Online Spin-Off — a spin-off that's only shown online, sometimes overlaps with Segment Spin-Off, sometimes a spin-off In Name Only. Generally only an advert for the broadcast programme.
-   Shared Continuity — more common nowadays, this spinoff generally carries no characters over from the show that spawned it, though both are in the same continuity, allowing for Crossovers from the original.
-   Side-Story: Very similar to the Shared Continuity. However, the side story is typically an independent and smaller scaled story with a definite beginning, middle, and end. It also features a completely different cast of characters who have no meaningful connection to the characters or events of the main epic. Thus, crossovers or cameos by recognized characters are less plausible and may even be perceived as distracting. The concept of a side-story (a story that takes place "to the side" of main events) was popularized by the term's first prominent appearance in reference to stories taking place in the _Gundam_ anime/manga universe.

Spinoffs are Older Than They Think. The character of Falstaff, from _Henry IV_ parts 1 and 2, was given their own play, at Royal request, by William Shakespeare.

See also Distaff Counterpart. When a TV series is successful enough to produce a film Spinoff, this is The Movie. Video Game spinoffs often feature the same cast but differing gameplay genres or are Gaiden Games starring one of the secondary or side characters. When the spin-off focuses on the descendant of a character from a previous installment, it's a Spin-Offspring. If the spin-off reimagines the characters as little kids, it's a Spin-Off Babies.

In the television industry, there is a technical difference between the terms "spinoff" and "sequel": a "spinoff" refers specifically to a television show that continues in (more or less) the same era as its predecessor, while a Sequel Series takes place _after_ the parent series' setting. (Some older sources will also freely use "spinoff" for _any_ mass-produced merchandise connected to a piece of media, from video games to underpants; more modern terminology will usually favor "tie-in" for that,)

-   _4★Town 4★Real_ is about 4\*Town as they spend their day before the climax of _Turning Red_.
-   _Attack on Titan_: _Attack On Titan Levi Side Story: A Choice With No Regrets_ manga, which is based on the _Choice With No Regrets_ visual novel included with the _Attack On Titan_ Vol.3 Blu-ray. This spin-off features Levi as the main character and serves as a prologue to the main series.

-   _Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo_: Don Patch got his own manga spinoff, _Fuwari! Don Patch_, in the Saikyou Jump magazine as well as a continuation called _Honnori! Don Patch_ that ran in Jump+. Both are a series of peaceful Slice of Life tales that take place in the modern day rather than the year 300X.
-   _Brave Witches_ to _Strike Witches_, shifting the focus from the 501st to the 502nd Striker Unit.
-   _Cells at Work!_ has produced many different Spin-Offs, each tackling a different bodily environment, subject matter, and even intended audience.

-   _A Certain Magical Index_ spawned a spinoff manga in _A Certain Scientific Railgun_, featuring Mikoto Misaka and delving into her background, friends, and some of the cases which Judgement handles. It later spawned a second manga spinoff, _A Certain Scientific Accelerator_, following Accelerator and the events after he receives his drama-preserving handicap. _Railgun_ then spawned a third manga spinoff, _A Certain Scientific Railgun Gaiden: Astral Buddy_, starring a minor character from said manga. Yup. A spinoff of a spinoff.

-   _Dragon Ball_ has an anime follow-up named _Dragon Ball GT_, set some years after the end of _Dragon Ball Z_, trying to get back the series to his comedic roots with Goku reverting to a child. It is not based on Akira Toriyama's original manga <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  ,so the original author only contributed on character designs. Word of God stated _GT_ was a side story to the original series.
    -   In 2015, _Dragon Ball Super_ premiered -with a manga running concurrent-, being an interquel between the Buu Saga and Goku and Uub's departure, integrating Movie characters Beerus and Whis and concepts like Alternate Universes to the franchise. This time, Akira Toriyama writes the plot outline and Toyotarō makes some plot additions and even designed some Gods of Destruction.
    -   There is also a short manga named _Dragon Ball: That Time I Got Reincarnated as Yamcha!_, where a teenager going to a _Dragon Ball_ event suddenly dies and awakes into the _Dragon Ball_ world as Yamcha, and tries to change the fate of said character.
-   _Fairy Tail_: Several have been serialized:
    -   _Fairy Tail ZERØ_, a backstory series starring Mavis Vermillion about the founding of Fairy Tail
    -   _Fairy Tail: Ice Trail,_ which is another backstory about Gray Fullbuster.
    -   _Fairy Tail: Blue Mistral_, another one focused on Wendy and Carla.
    -   _Fairy Girls_, which as the name implies, has the female members of Fairy Tail as the main characters.
    -   _Fairy Tail Gaiden_ is a sub-series written by Kyouta Shibano:
        -   _The Twin Dragons of Saber Tooth_, which is focused on Sting and Rogue.
        -   _Rhodonite_, focused on Gajeel.
        -   _Flash of Great Lightning_, detailing the events of Laxus and the Raijin Tribe during Fairy Tail's disbandment.
-   _Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA_: a spinoff Magical Girl story involving Illya as the protagonist.
-   _Fist of the North Star_ (_Hokuto no Ken_) has a series of spinoff works known as the _Hokuto no Ken Gaiden_ series, which centers around side-characters from the original manga, depicting what happened to them prior to the events of _Hokuto no Ken_, although they do deviate from canon a bit. Almost all of them, with the exception of _Yuria Gaiden_, were published in _Weekly Comic Bunch_ (the manga anthology that serializes _Souten no Ken_) at the time the _Legends of the True Savior_ movies were released.

-   _Genshiken_ → _Kujibiki♡Unbalance_ was initially a Show Within a Show, meant to represent the typical moe anime, but with the series' success, it ended up being defictionalized.
-   _Goblin Slayer_ has _Year One_ (expanding on when Goblin Slayer was just starting out), _Brand New Day_ (adapting a number of side stories) and _Daikatana of Singing Death_ (expanding on Sword Maiden's rise from a broken woman to one of those who slayed the demon lord).
-   The Anime Adaptation of _Idolish 7_ has _Idolish7: Vibrato_, a web series exclusive to _Youtube Premium_.

-   _Jewelpet_ → _Jewelpet Twinkle☆_ → _Jewelpet Sunshine_ → _Jewelpet Kira Deco!_ → _Jewelpet Happiness_. All of the series share the same Jewelpets, but not the same characters in general to prevent canon confusion.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ has a spin-off with the _Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe_ series, consisting of several irregularly published one-shots starring Rohan Kishibe, a side character from the manga's fourth part _Diamond is Unbreakable_. These one-shots features beings more esoteric than Stands and vampires, such as original cryptids and other powerful spirits, some considered gods. Although characters from Part 4 regularly appear, it can be inferred that the spin-off is in a different continuity than the current part.
-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ has two spin-offs. The first, _Kaguya-sama: Love is War Doujin Edition_, is basically the main series but Hotter and Sexier. The second, _We Want to Talk About Kaguya_, is an Innocent Bystander Series told from the perspective of two Recurring Extras as they grossly misinterpret the events of earlier chapters and get involved with the series' Beta Couple.
-   _Kamisama Minarai: Himitsu no Cocotama_ has two different spin-offs.
    -   _Kira Kira Happy Hirake Cocotama_ is a Magical Girl-style (sort of) reimagining with only one protagonist and a set of new Cocotamas.
    -   _Mono No Kamisama Cocotama_ is about life in the eyes of a Cocotama.
-   The _Lyrical Nanoha_ franchises is one long string of these and even started as a spin-off of _Triangle Heart 3: Sweet Songs Forever_. Within the current canon there's the original series and its three sequels, an audio play spin-off focusing on characters introduces in the third season, a Spin-Offspring manga focusing on Nanoha's adopted daughter, a spin-off of the Spin-Offspring focusing on brand new characters, and an alternate universe manga where everyone plays card games.

-   _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_ has _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid: Kanna's Daily Life_, _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid: Elma's Office Lady Diary_, _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid: Lucoa is my xx_, and _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid: Fafnir the Recluse_ each of which focuses on one of the secondary dragons. The only one who doesn't have their own dedicated series is Ilulu.
-   _My Hero Academia_:
    -   _My Hero Academia: Vigilantes_ is set a few months before the main series. It focuses on a group of vigilante heroes trying to prevent the Psycho Serum Trigger from spreading.
    -   _My Hero Academia Smash!!_ is a gag manga showing the characters in chibi form.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   _Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth_, a comical spinoff focusing on Rock Lee. It got an anime adaptation as well.
    -   _Uchiha Sasuke's Sharingan Chronicles_, another comical spinoff showing Sasuke and Taka's wacky side.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_:
    -   The manga series _Shinji Ikari Raising Project_ is based on the video game of the same name. It takes the alternate reality from Episode 26 as inspiration, and as such is more comedic and most of its characters are much more emotional stable, all while keeping their most notable traits, albeit more subdued. Before that, there was _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days_, based on the eponymus game as well. Its characters are alternate versions of the main continuity and it ended with a much happier ending than the anime.
    -   _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse_ is an Elseverse where Shinji attends NERV —which is a Catholic school and he and the other children must use EVAS (not mechas, but wieldable weapons) used to fight Angels (which in this series are parasitic beings which uses human bodies as hosts) in order to secure cores without which Yggdrasil may eventually cause a collapse of reality.

-   _One Piece_ has a few:
    -   _Chopperman_, which stars Chopper as a super hero fighting against the evil Dr. Usodabada. It was initially a gag story in one of the databooks, before it was adapted into its own spin-off manga.
    -   _One Piece Party_, a Lighter and Softer comedic spinoff with self-contained stories and Super-Deformed designs.
    -   _Koisuru One Piece_ is an odd spin-off as it revolves about three fans of the manga series (even named after Luffy and his crew), who encounter situations similar to their favorite series.
    -   Similarly, _One Piece: Kobiyama Who Looks Like Koby - Two Piece in a Pod_ deals with the titular Kobiyama — who oddly enough does not know of the series — and his interactions with other characters who resemble those from the main series.
    -   _Chin Piece_ can easily be considered the most bizarre of all, as the main character Kusopp and his friends want to be as great as the Straw Hats, and encounter Chimpy who rssembles Luffy and _whose penis can stretch like Luffy's_.
    -   _One Piece School_, from the same author of _Party_, which is a middle school AU featuring Coby enrolling into New World Middle school and befriending Luffy and the other Straw Hats as students.
    -   _Food Wars! Shokugeki no Sanji_, a semi-crossover authored by the very creators of _Shokugeki no Soma_ Yūto Tsukuda and Shun Saeki and revolves about Sanji's cooking delighting several characters in the same manner as Soma does in his own series.

-   _Please Twins!_ is set one year after the events of _Please Teacher!_, it shares most locations and many of the first anime characters come back either as cameo or secondary characters.
-   Various side story episodes of _Pokémon: The Series_ featured former party members after they had left the group. The early ones focusing on Tracey and Misty along with Tournament Arc rival Ritchie were dubbed as the _Pokémon Chronicles_ subseries.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ has _Puella Magi Kazumi Magica_, which is about another group of magical girls. Its other spin-off, _Puella Magi Oriko Magica_ is either a Prequel or an Interquel. A third spin-off entitled _Puella Magi Madoka Magica: The Different Story_ was released for the Compilation Movie, and it is part Prequel, P.O.V. Sequel, and What If? story. Three new spin-offs began after the premiere of _Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie: Rebellion_. One is an _Oriko Magica_ prequel. The other ones are _Puella Magi Suzune Magica_, which is about another group of magical girls, and _Puella Magi Tart Magica_, which elaborates on a background detail from the anime.
-   _Ray the Animation_ is a spin-off of _Black Jack_, focusing on one of Black Jack's students. The manga is _technically_ one, but Black Jack is merely a Lawyer-Friendly Cameo; as the anime was made by the studio Osamu Tezuka founded, which holds the rights to his creations, it didn't need to obfuscate things that way.

-   _Saint Seiya_ produced a _crapton_ of spin-offs:
    -   _Saint Seiya: Episode.G_, drawn by Okada Megumu, who focuses on Gold Saint Aiolia long before the main series. It produced its own spin-off, _Saint Seiya: Episode.G Assassin_.
    -   _Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas_, another prequel, as well as _The Lost Canvas Chronicles_.
    -   _Saint Seiya: Next Dimension_, a sequel drawn by Kurumada himself.
    -   _Saint Seiya: Saintia Sho_, which takes place during the events of the main series but focuses on female protagonists.
    -   _Saint Seiya Omega_, a 2012 animated series following a new generation of Saints.
-   _Summer Time Rendering_: _Summertime Rendering 2026: The Room that Dreams of Murder_ is a short, two chapter spinoff that takes place several years after the events of the main story starring Hizuru as she helps her niece solve the mystery of a haunted apartment. The Light Novel _Summertime Rendering 2026: Nagumo Ryuunosuke's 100 Views_ is a direct continuation which follows the two of them as they solve supernatural mysteries around Tokyo.
-   There was a manga called _Ten - The Blessed Way of the Nice Guy_, which was about mahjong being serious business, there was a character called Akagi which was an awesome old man who the characters feared and respected, the character was so popular the author made an spinoff prequel series focused on Akagi's early life, at one point he meets his match in an old man called Washizu, who was so popular the author made a spinoff series focused on Washizu's early life (yes, Fukumoto made a spinoff of a spinoff).
-   A concrete anime example is _To Heart 2_, which takes place in the same school as the original _To Heart_, only that it is set three years after. Some nods and cameos reinforce this.
-   _Tweeny Witches_ has an episodic 6-episode OVA titled _Tweeny Witches: The Adventures_.
-   _WWW.WORKING!!_ to _Wagnaria!!_, focusing on a different set of employees at a different branch of the Wagnaria restaurant. Franchise wise, the latter is this to the former; anime wise, it's the opposite case (being based off of the print collection rather than the original webcomic, which was made long after the latter got its time in the animated sun).

-   _Yo-kai Watch_ has two spinoffs: the Spin-Offspring series _Yo-kai Watch: Shadowside_ and the Middle School AU _Yo-kai Watch Jam - Yo-kai Academy Y: Close Encounters of the N Kind_.

-   _Motu Patlu_ has two spin-offs.
    -   The first is called _Inspector Chingum_ and is about the character Inspector Chingum moving to Shantiwood to fight supervillains sent out by No Baal, the owner of Crime Academy.
    -   The second, _Guddu the Great_, focuses on Guddu the lion from the theatrical film _Motu Patlu: King of Kings_.
-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_ has a spinoff called _Pleasant Goat Fun Class_, where the characters are much younger versions of themselves who learn about the world around them.
-   South Korean TV animation series _Titipo Titipo the Little Train_ is a spin-off of more famous sister series called _Tayo the Little Bus_. Two series are set in the same universe and several characters from each series frequently make guest or cameo appearances to each other, almost to the level of Required Spinoff Crossover. _Pororo the Little Penguin_, another smash hit from the same production company, deals with the separate continuity, but Pororo sticker made an appearance in _Titipo_ as a meaningful prop, making it a Show Within a Show.

    Audio Plays 

-   _Doctor Who_ → _Big Finish Doctor Who_ → _Sarah Jane Smith_, _I Davros_, _Cyberman_, _Gallifrey_, _Jago & Litefoot_, _Kaldor City_, _Dalek Empire_. The main Big Finish line is broadly part of the Whoniverse, while the spinoffs are part of the Expanded Universe.
    -   _UNIT_ follows a new team of UNIT officers in the early 21st century, with a guest appearance from The Brigadier himself.

    -   _Tales from New Earth_ stars Senator (formerly Novice) Hame following the TV episode "Gridlock".
-   _Yandere Heaven_ gets a special BL edition called _Yandere Heaven BLack_. It features very similar situations, but with a male protagonist instead of female.

    Comic Books 

-   _Fables_ → _Jack Of Fables_, featuring The Trickster of the same name, who was every "Jack" in folk tale or legend, and _Fairest_, a series of side stories each spotlighting different female secondary characters from the main comic.
-   The second volume of _Runaways_ had a Poorly Disguised Pilot for _The Loners_, a miniseries featuring a group of former teen heroes making questionably-sincere attempts to quit the hero business.

-   _The Sandman (1989)_ has several spin-offs following supporting characters, including:
    -   _Lucifer_, which follows the adventures of Lucifer after he quits being Ruler of Hell in _The Sandman: Season of Mists_.
    -   _The Thessaliad_ and _Thessaly: Witch for Hire_, in which Dream's murderous ex-girlfriend Thessaly deals with new problems brought on by a ghost named Fetch.
    -   _Death: The High Cost of Living_, in which Death takes one day off and spends a day as a mortal, and _Death: The Time of Your Life_.
-   _The Mighty Thor_: Has a interesting relationship with _Journey into Mystery_. Thor debuted in _Journey into Mystery_ and headlined it for a while before taking over the title completely and later getting another series. 49 years after his debut, _Journey into Mystery_ is introduced as a spin-off taking over Thor's numbering and Thor gets another series.
-   _Fantastic Four_: After the death of the Human Torch, the book ended at issue 588 and was revamped as _FF_ (FF in the title standing for Future Foundation).

-   _The Authority_ began as a spin-off of _Stormwatch_. It later spawned two spin-offs of its own - _The Monarchy_, about the surviving members of Stormwatch, and _Kev_, about a hapless SAS operative who keeps having to team up with the Midnighter. There was also a very short-lived _Midnighter_ solo series. As for _Stormwatch_, its original incarnation spawned a spin-off about Backlash.
-   The original Ms. Marvel started out with amnesia, but was obviously the alter ego of Carol Danvers, formerly a recurring character in _Captain Marvel_; she soon realized that like Mar-Vell, she had gained her powers from the Kree, and spontaneously named herself after him. Meanwhile, Carol began working at the Daily Bugle, so _Spider-Man_ characters showed up as well.
-   Pointedly averted with the DC Comics character Naomi. As creator Brian Michael Bendis noted in this interview, he considers her story too special to have her introduced in a book that isn't hers and spun off from there, necessitating her own self-contained limited series exploring her character and how she became a superhero before she makes her debut within the greater DC Universe in _Action Comics_ #1015.
-   _Richie Rich_ is a spin-off of the _Little Dot_ comics. Interestingly, Dot herself would have various stories in the _Richie Rich_ comics as well.

    -   _Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D._ was a Time Skip that showed Sgt. Fury's post-war career, introduced S.H.I.E.L.D. to the Marvel Universe and swiftly overshadowed his original series.
-   The DC Comics Crisis Crossover _Bloodlines_ had several series spun off that focused on the heroes who gained powers after surviving their encounters with the alien parasites, the longest-lasting and most well-known being _Hitman (1993)_, with protagonist Tommy Monaghan debuting in the second Annual issue of _The Demon_ and resurfacing in a couple of arcs in the main comic before he got his own comic that ran for 61 issues.
-   Milestone Comics
    -   The _Deathwish_ miniseries was a spinoff of _Hardware (1993)_, though the actual protagonist was a transgender cop named Marisa Rahm and Deathwish was a supporting character at best.
    -   _Blood Syndicate_ had two spinoff miniseries to its name, _My Name is Holocaust_ (where the unscrupulous criminal Holocaust is the main character) and _Wise Son: The White Wolf_ (a miniseries focusing on Blood Syndicate member Wise Son that started publication shortly after the main series ended).

-   _Grindhouse_ featured a Fake Trailer for _Machete_ which later became a film of its own. Word of God also states that the Machete from _Spy Kids_ is the same Machete, so it also counts for that film.
-   _The Graveyard_ (notable for featuring Mark Salling, pre-_Glee_) exists in the same universe as the _Bloody Murder_ duology.
-   The _Star Trek_ franchise has three spinoff film series to date:

Set in the same universe, characters such as Tiffany Fluffit and Chuck Melon of Channel 6 Action News are made recurring characters of _Cat on the Run_, while The Bad Guys themselves have small picture cameos. The series appears to be taking place earlier in the life of _The Bad Guys_, as The Bad Guys are still put in a negative light, while Tiffany Fluffit is in her far less developed characterization.
-   Plantagenet Palliser, a minor character in _The Small House at Allingham_, one of _The Chronicles of Barsetshire_ by Anthony Trollope, became a main character of Trollope's _Palliser_ series, written in the 1860s and 1870s.

-   _Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid_ is a spin-off of the _Diary of a Wimpy Kid_ series, told in a Perspective Flip from Greg Heffley's best friend Rowley Jefferson.
-   _Doctor Who_ Expanded Universe:
    -   The _Doctor Who New Adventures_ were published by Virgin Publishing under license from the BBC. When the BBC decided to take the license back to start publishing their own Eighth Doctor Adventures, Virgin spun off the _Bernice Summerfield_ novels, which continued to tell similar sci-fi adventure stories using characters and worldbuilding elements that had been created for the New Adventures (and which Virgin consequently retained rights to) or which could be licensed separately from the writers that had created them.
    -   One of the _Eighth Doctor Adventures_ novels by Lawrence Miles introduced Faction Paradox, an association of anarchic time-traveling villains. After leaving the series, Miles instituted his own series of _Faction Paradox_ novels.
    -   Telos published a series of _Doctor Who_ novellas; one of them, _Cabinet of Light_, introduced a set of characters who were spun off into the _Time Hunter_ series.
    -   Candy Jar Books publish a series of _Lethbridge-Stuart_ novels, mostly but not entirely set before he was The Brigadier.

-   The _Dora Wilk Series_ has _Shaman Blues_, with the main character being someone who was Put on a Bus for large parts of the parent series.

-   _The Iliad_ and the _The Odyssey_ both cover the same story but through different cultural lenses. _The Aeneid_ also follows the adventures of a minor character from _The Iliad_, but it was written by a different writer hundreds of years later.
-   The minor character of Auri in _The Kingkiller Chronicle_ received a spin-off novella all about her, _The Slow Regard of Silent Things_.
-   The main _The Lost Fleet_ series ends with John Geary bringing said fleet back and then proceeding to force an end to the 100-year-war between the Alliance and the Syndicate Worlds. The immediate spin-off series _The Lost Fleet: Beyond the Frontier_ features many of the same characters and has Geary being sent to a distant part of space in order to look for aliens. _The Lost Stars_ series features new focus characters and deals with the collapse of the Syndicate Worlds after the war. The author is currently working on a prequel trilogy called _The Genesis Fleet_, detailing the formation of the Alliance centuries prior. There is also a spin-off comic book series _Lost Fleet Corsair_, focusing on the adventures of Geary's grandnephew Michael.
-   The _Mercy Thompson_ series has the spin-off series _Alpha and Omega_ which follows a character introduced in the first book and his wife. A few short stories focusing on other side character are also set in the same universe.
-   _The Mortal Instruments_ received the prequel series _The Infernal Devices_. It is an interesting example; the two series share a couple characters, (namely, Magnus and Camille), but they're not central to either series, and all the other characters are new. Plus, _The Infernal Devices_ takes place 200 years before _The Mortal Instruments_.

-   _Super Powereds_ has _Corpies_, focused on the Retired Badass Titan, who decides to return to the Hero life after a 10-year absence following a sex scandal. He makes several appearances in the main series after the spin-off. Two other _Corpies_ characters also make appearances in the main series, and one's full name is mentioned _only_ in the main series. The author is also working on another spin-off called _Blades & Barriers_.
-   _Sweet Valley High_ gave us... dear lord. There were _eight different spin-offs_ of the original series, all but one of them also being about the twins that served as main characters at various points in their lives. The seven that were about the twins were _Sweet Valley Twins, Sweet Valley University, Sweet Valley Kids, Sweet Valley Junior High, Sweet Valley Senior Year, Elizabeth,_ and _The Sweet Life_. The last spin-off, _The Unicorn Club_, takes place when the twins are in middle school but focuses on the club instead.
-   The _Arrivals from the Dark_ series has a spin-off series called _Trevelyan's Mission_, taking place in the same universe but centuries later and focusing on a single character (while the _Arrivals_ series largely focuses on different characters from the same family across generations). Unlike the main series, which could be considered military science fiction, the spin-off takes place in a time of peace and focuses on cultural exploration. Notably, both six-book series were largely written in parallel (and both are likely over given Died During Production).
-   _Woodwalkers And Friends_ is one to _Woodwalkers_. The novels of the series are set during or between the events of the original books- for example, _Katzige Gefährten_ is set between the last book of _Woodwalkers_ and the first book of _Seawalkers_.

    Live-Action TV 

### **In General:**

-   Game show instances:
    -   _Family Feud_ is widely believed to be a spinoff of _Match Game_ in that its questions were formatted similar to the original 60s MG and used national surveys to cull answers (MG used previous studio audiences).
    -   1983's _Go_ is thought to be a spinoff of 1980's _Chain Reaction_ since its front game was the _Chain Reaction_ bonus round.

### **Series:**

-   _Agent Carter_ spun off from _Captain America: The First Avenger_. Peggy Carter was Cap's main love interest in the 40's, and her show is about her moving on with her life and having adventures of her own after he was frozen in the Arctic and presumed dead. Had the show not been cancelled after two seasons, it would have showed her founding SHIELD with Iron Man's father Howard Stark. The show was later given a Fully Absorbed Finale in _Avengers: Endgame_ when (after seeing Edwin Jarvis and Peggy in The '70s), Steve Rogers elects to stay in the past and live out his life with her.
-   Norman Lear's _All in the Family_ spun off multiple shows, some of which had their own spinoffs:
    -   _Maude_ focused on the antics of Edith's limousine liberal cousin.
        -   Maude had a housekeeper named Florida, who became the lead of the equally successful _Good Times_. However, it's spin-off status is hazy since much of the backstory we're given would have made it impossible for Florida to have been Maude's maid due to living in Chicago.
    -   _The Jeffersons_ was about Archie's neighbors, George and Louse Jefferson (natch), who unexpectedly became wealthy and moved away to their own show.
        -   Like Florida, their housekeeper Florence later received her own spin-off, _Checking In_, which was _not_ equally successful — cancelled after four episodes. Florence returned to her former employers.
    -   As its original stars moved on to other projects, _All in the Family_ spun off its sequel, _Archie Bunker's Place_.
        -   The sequel itself had a one season spin-off, _Gloria,_ which featured Archie's daughter Gloria, having divorced Mike, starting a new life in New York.
    -   The last gasp of the franchise came in 1994, with yet another (short-lived) spinoff: _704 Hauser_, about the people who were then living in what had been Archie's house. The adult Joey Stivic (son of Michael and Gloria) drops by for a visit in the first episode.
-   _America's Funniest Home Videos_ spun off into _America's Funniest People_. Unlike the former, which specalized in candid and unscripted funny moments getting caught on-camera and sent in by home viewers, the latter relied on intentionally staged comedy sketches. Both shows were hosted by _Full House_ alumni at their inception (Bob Saget on the former; Dave Coulier on the latter) and both even had Ernie Anderson as the announcer.
-   _Arrowverse_:
    -   _The Flash (2014)_ spun off from _Arrow_. Main character Barry Allen was introduced in a two-parter from _Arrow_'s second season, gaining his super-speed powers at the end, and a later episode that season introduced supporting characters Cisco and Caitlin. Plans for a full-on Backdoor Pilot were cancelled.
    -   Both _Arrow_ and _The Flash_ then spun off _Legends of Tomorrow_, laying the groundwork in their 2015 crossover "Legends of Today" / "Legends of Yesterday".
    -   Two animated shows were spun off as well, on the streaming service CW Seed: _Vixen_ and _Freedom Fighters: The Ray_.
    -   Other shows began separately but were added to the Arrowverse retroactively: _Supergirl_, _Constantine_ and _Black Lightning_.
    -   _Batwoman_ was spun off from the 2018 "Elseworlds" crossover.
    -   _Superman & Lois_ was originally developed as a spinoff from _Supergirl_, with many actors reprising their roles, but was later shown to take place in a different universe.
-   You probably wouldn't expect a Ken Burns documentary series, let alone that within his Great American Trilogy, to have one, but _Baseball_ does—specifically, a 2016 two-part miniseries following the life of Brooklyn Dodgers player Jackie Robinson.
-   After Steve Wilkos left _The Jerry Springer Show_ after being the director of security there, he was given his own series, _The Steve Wilkos Show_, which deals with _much_ more serious topics.
-   _Baptiste_ is a spinoff from _The Missing_.
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_ → _Caprica_, a prequel spinoff which follows the creation of Cylons ~50 years before the setting of the parent show.
-   _Being Human_ had an online spinoff called _Becoming Human_ which focused on Adam, a character that had featured in an episode of the parent show, and otherwise entirely new characters.
-   _The Beverly Hillbillies_, the other rural big sitcom franchise of the 1960s, spun off _Petticoat Junction_, which in turn spun off _Green Acres._
-   _The Brittas Empire_ had a very short one after it's end called _Get Fit with Brittas_, which was an Edutainment Show where Brittas taught the audience about the importance of healthy living. The other cast members of the show do show up, but not all of them and only in one shot roles.
-   _Beverly Hills, 90210_ had a spin-off, _Melrose Place_, within two years of its introduction. _Melrose Place_ itself spun off a not-as-successful spin-off _Models Inc._, which lasted only a season.

-   _Bones_ → _The Finder_
-   _Breaking Bad_ has _Better Call Saul_, which the protagonist is Saul Goodman, Walter White's lawyer and "advisor". The series focus on Saul's life before he was a lawyer under his real name (Jimmy McGill) and also shows what happened to him after the events of _Breaking Bad_, serving as both a prequel and a sequel to the main series as well.
-   Referenced in the Grand Finale of _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_, Amy tricks Jake into believing he's been in a coma for years, and in the intervening period Boyle became the sheriff of a small town in Arizona, where he is also the principal of the local high school.

**Jake:** OK, that's weird.  
**Amy:** It's actually very funny, and surprisingly heartwarming.

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ spun off _Angel_, featuring the _Buffy_ main characters of Angel and Cordelia, with the guest character Wesley joining later in the series. Crossovers between the two were frequent until _Buffy_ moved to a new network.
-   _Caerdydd_ spun into _Gwaith Cartref_. Neither Emyr nor Sara mentions Lea, Peter, or any of the other characters from the earlier show – which is strange, given how it ended.

-   _The Carol Burnett Show_, later in its run, featured a recurring segment entitled _The Family._ With Carol Burnett as Eunice, Harvey Norman as her husband Ed, Tim Conway as Ed's employee and sidekick Mickey Hart, and Vicki Lawrence as Eunice's Mama, the sketch-series was an immediate hit and is still fondly remembered by the show's fans. When the series ended, _Mama's Family_ was spun off. Sadly, with only Ms. Lawrence reprising her role, the spinoff never achieved the comic heights of the original.

-   _Cheers_:
    -   _Cheers_ had a prior spinoff, _Meet the Tortellis_, featuring Carla's ex-husband. The show did not last very long.
    -   When the series ended, Frasier Crane left Boston to move back home to Seattle, becoming the main character of his own show, _Frasier_. Crossovers with characters from _Cheers_ were frequent, with all of Sam, Diane, Lilith, Carla, Norm, Cliff, and Woody all making appearances at one point or another.
-   _The Chica Show_ is this to _Sprout_'s "The Sunny Side Up Show."

-   _The Daily Show_ gave birth to _The Colbert Report_, which started as a fictional show in commercials promoting _The Daily Show_ and became defictionalized.
-   _Dallas_ gave rise to the show _Knots Landing_. Interestingly enough, _Knots Landing_ was actually shopped first to CBS, but rejected. When _Dallas_ took off, they inserted one of the Ewing brothers and re-shopped KL as a spin-off. What makes this situation unusual is that when an entire season of _Dallas_ was retconned to have been All Just a Dream, this also meant that the _entire spin-off_ had to be either All Just a Dream as well, or else not a spin-off after all.

-   _Department S_ → _Jason King_, which gave Peter Wyngarde's flamboyant novelist/detective character his own adventures.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   _Doctor Who_ → _K-9 and Company_, _Torchwood_, _The Sarah Jane Adventures_, _K9_, and _Class_ are all part of the Whoniverse which revolves around the Doctor, but do not usually feature him. However, the only thing linking _K9_ to the Whoniverse is the presence of the eponymous robot dog. _K9_ was not produced by the BBC, so it cannot directly reference _Doctor Who_ and vice versa.
    -   In the early 2000s, there were four _Doctor Who_ online animated specials featuring the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Doctors, and an alternate Ninth Doctor.
-   The TLC series _Dr. Pimple Popper_ is an inversion of the Online Spin-Off, and is possibly the Ur-Example of a web video property that moved to linear TV. It's an expansion of the YouTube channel of Southern California dermatologist Sandra Lee, who became a major Internet celebrity as "Dr. Pimple Popper".
-   _The Dukes of Hazzard_ → _Enos_, which focused on Deputy Enos Strate moving out West and working for the LAPD.
-   _EastEnders_ had a spin-off _E20_ following a group of teenagers outside of the main cast. Some were later promoted to the main series.
-   _Eureka_ and _Warehouse 13_ are established as a shared canon during an episode on each show in which each had a character visiting from the other. There was also a brief appearance of a recurring _Warehouse 13_ character in an episode of _Alphas_, putting all three series in one universe.

-   _Fantasy Island (2021)_: The series is one of _Fantasy Island_, with Mr. Rourke's grand niece Elena now running things.
-   _FBI_ led to _FBI: Most Wanted_ and to _FBI: International_.
-   _Five Fwd_ is the parent show for Channel Five's _The Gadget Show_ and _Fifth Gear_. The former features a formalised news segment which has never been part of the main programme with a different presenter and games reviews and interviews with one of the regular presenters- something that rarely appears in the show proper.
-   Home-renovation show _Flip Or Flop_ has a complicated series of spinoffs. When stars Tarek and Christina El Moussa were getting divorced and the show's future was uncertain, HGTV gave them each a separate show — _Christina on the Coast_ (focusing on Christina's interior design business) and _Flipping 101_ (in which Tarek serves as mentor to novice house-flippers). _Flip or Flop_ continued for a couple more seasons before ending in 2022, meaning all three shows were on HGTV's schedule. Since then, _Christina on the Coast_ received its own spinoff, _Christina in the Country_ (featuring Christina setting up a design business in Tennessee, where she has a home with her new husband), and the original show has a Spiritual Successor with _The Flipping El Moussas_, in which Tarek is joined by his new wife.
-   _Friends_ had a Spin-Off called _Joey_, focussing on the character of Joey Tribbiani, who was popular enough to get his own show. It revolved around Joey moving to Los Angeles to try and make it as a big star, and introduced new members of Joey's family. Though popular at first, its popularity declined during the second season, causing it to be cancelled mid-season in the US, though the remaining episodes did air overseas and were eventually released on DVD.
-   _Garth Marenghis Darkplace_ → _Man to Man with Dean Learner_. A complicated one - the first show was a metafictional horror parody also featuring "interviews" with the fictional actors and creators involved with the fictional "show". The second show was a parody talk show featuring one of the fictional actors as host.

-   _The Golden Girls_:
    -   The series led into _Empty Nest_, focusing on the life and adventures of the Girls' neighbor and friend Harry, a hospital pediatrician. Occasional crossovers between the two casts took place on both shows. _Empty Nest_ had its own short-lived spinoff, _Nurses_, which was about the nurses who worked with Harry at the hospital.
    -   _The Golden Girls_ had a second spinoff, _The Golden Palace_, which started after the series finale. With Dorothy off being Happily Married, the remaining three Girls joined forces to purchase and run a hotel called the Golden Palace. It didn't live up to the popularity of the original and only lasted for one season.
-   _Growing Pains_ spun off _Just the Ten of Us_ when recurring character Coach Lubbock loses his job at Dewey High and is subsequently offered a teaching job in Eureka, California.

-   _The Gruen Transfer_, an advertisement mocking/dissection satirical panel show spun off _Gruen Nation_ an elections advertising, spin, branding and image control satirical panel show. That spawned _Gruen Planet_ a global advertising, spin, branding and image control satirical panel show which finally gave birth to _Gruen Sweat_ an Olympics advertising, spin, branding and image control satirical panel show.

-   Garry Marshall was just as prolific spinning off _Happy Days_:
    -   _Laverne & Shirley_ was, for two seasons, HD's More Popular Spin-Off.
    -   _Mork & Mindy_ resulted from what was intended to be a one-shot episode; however, it was _not_ meant to be a Poorly Disguised Pilot; in fact, Robin Williams was a last-minute substitute for John Byner!
    -   In turn, Mork appeared on the first episode of another spinoff, _Out Of The Blue,_ and its main character also appeared on HD.
    -   Star Nancy Walker introduced her lead character (Mr. C's cousin) for _Blansky's Beauties_ on HD, which also imported identical cousin (played by same actor) of recurring _Laverne and Shirley_ character Carmine. That didn't help the show's ratings, but the show did introduce the actors who would play future HD regulars Lori Beth Cunningham, nee Allen, and the Fonz's very own cousin, who would eventually get his own spinoff...
    -   _Joanie Loves Chachi._ While remembered as a flop, it actually had decent ratings the first season and might have been a Quietly Performing Sister Show if the network hadn't played with its scheduling.
    -   Happy Days itself was a spin-off of the anthology series, _Love, American Style_.
-   _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_ → _Xena: Warrior Princess_. Xena was introduced as villain who considered Hercules a Worthy Opponent, but a short-lived romance between the two convinced her to become a hero herself, and her own series revolves around her redemption from her warlord past.

-   _iCarly_ set up a spinoff built around Gibby that never got past a pilot. On the other hand, Sam as well as Cat from _Victorious_ went on to, well, _Sam & Cat_.
-   _Inspector Morse_ spun off into _Lewis_ with a minor Time Skip. The series picked up in 2007 after _Inspector Morse_ ended in 2000. In 2012 a second spin-off was started, _Endeavour_, a Prequel featuring a young Morse as a rookie cop in the 1960s.
-   _Inspector Rex_: Stockinger got his own series after he was transferred to Salzburg. It lasted two seasons.
-   _JAG_ led to a More Popular Spin-Off about the investigators behind the courtroom cases, _NCIS_, which takes place at the agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C. Three spinoffs to date about NCIS teams in other cities with heavy Navy presence have been produced: _NCIS: Los Angeles_, _NCIS: New Orleans_, and _NCIS: Hawaiʻi_. Crossovers between these and other CBS shows give rise to a Shared Universe referred to as the Bellisarioverse after _JAG_'s creator, Donald P. Bellisario.

-   _Knight Rider_ spun off _Team Knight Rider_ which focused on five new talking vehicles and heroes.
-   _Laguna Beach_ → _The Hills_ → _The City 2008_. At the end of the second season of _Laguna Beach_, lead character Lauren decides to pursue an internship at Teen Vogue and heads off to Los Angeles, while minor background character Heidi (glimpsed in scenes during the second season) also moves to L.A. to live with Lauren and work at another company. That premise became _The Hills_, which followed both of their adventures in the city. Several seasons later, Whitney Port (Lauren's co-worker at Teen Vogue) decides to move to New York after meeting Kelly Cutrone, the founder of PR firm The People's Revolution. That premise became _The City_, which lasted for two seasons and had a similar format to _The Hills_.
-   _Life on Mars_ → _Ashes to Ashes_. This was partly a spin-off and partly a sequel, as it featured a new protagonist, but retained most of the other regular characters from the previous show after a Time Skip.

-   _Love, Victor_ is a spin-off of the movie _Love, Simon_. It takes place a few years after the movie an dit follows a new character named Victor who attends the same school Simon did. When he starts to question his sexuality he decides to write Simon and they become the digital Pen Pals.

-   The Sheldon Leonard-produced, Danny Thomas sitcom _Make Room for Daddy_ has one memorable episode in which Thomas encounters a homespun Southern sheriff. The resulting show, _The Andy Griffith Show_, went on to be an even bigger success than its progenitor. It in turn spun off sister show _Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C._ and sequel _Mayberry R.F.D._, becoming the first major big "rural sitcom" franchise of the 1960s.
-   _The Mary Tyler Moore Show_ spun off two sister series, _Rhoda_ and _Phyllis_, as well as its retool/sequel spinoff _Lou Grant_.
-   The popularity of _M\*A\*S\*H_ was such that a spinoff was all but inevitable, and it had two: _After M\*A\*S\*H_, which brought Klinger, Potter, and Father Mulcahy together again in the United States, and _Trapper John, M.D._, which was about Trapper John's life after his discharge.

-   _Odd Squad_:
    -   _OddTube_ is a Vlog Series spin-off with a first season that focuses on the Season 2 main characters (Otis, Olympia, Oona and Oprah) with Olympia serving as primary host, while its second season shifts focus towards the Season 3 main characters (Opal, Orla, Omar, and Oprah, as the Big O) with Orla serving as primary host. Season 1 is considered canon in the main show, but it's left ambiguous as to whether that is the case with Season 2 as well.
    -   By definition, _Odd Squad_ has the spin-off _Odd Squad Mobile Unit,_ taking place in the same universe with the same premise but with a different core setting and different characters. It's marketed as a spinoff in countries outside of the United States.

-   _Once Upon a Time_ → _Once Upon a Time in Wonderland_, a mini-series featuring mainly characters related to _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_, some of whom were later brought into the main series.
-   _Only Fools and Horses_ → _The Green Green Grass_, in which two supporting characters, Boycie and Marlene, relocated from London to rural Shropshire in order to escape the wrath of the Driscoll brothers. Back in The '80s when the original show was at its peak, writer John Sullivan had plans for a sequel called _Hot Rod_ (which would have actually been an After Show as it was basically intended to be _Only Fools and Horses_ without Del Boy) when actor David Jason wanted to leave, but when he changed his mind that plan was shelved.
-   _Perfect Strangers_ spun off the minor character of Harriette Winslow, the elevator operator at Balki and Larry's employer, into her own show, _Family Matters_.

-   The first seven seasons of _Power Rangers_ used a few old characters mixed with new ones. Starting with _Lightspeed Rescue_, they used the no character variant, all set in the same universe, with characters only returning for team-up episodes. The exceptions were _Power Rangers: Dino Thunder_ and _Power Rangers Samurai_, where Tommy and Bulk returned as main characters, respectively.
-   _Police Story (1973)_ had _Police Woman_, _Joe Forrester_, and _David Cassidy Man Under Cover_.
-   _The Practice_ had the spin off _Boston Legal_, where the spinoff was designed around characters originally introduced in the original in a serious case of Final Season Casting.

-   _Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In_ spun off the daytime series _Letters to Laugh-In,_ where a celebrity panel read jokes sent in by viewers and were scored by an enclave of judges. It replaced the original _Match Game_ on NBC and ran thirteen weeks.
-   _Saturday Night Live_'s "TV Funhouse" segments eventually became their own series.
-   _Soap_'s sarcastic butler, Benson, was given his own show, _Benson_, where the character eventually became Lt Governor of the state.

-   _Stargate Atlantis_ and _Stargate Universe_ both spun-off of the show _Stargate SG-1_, which itself was based on the film _Stargate_. _Atlantis_ is set in the lost city of Atlantis and features characters from the first series such as Major Carter who ran the installation in later seasons. _Universe_ was set after both in continuity and the setting meant that old characters showed up far less often.
-   _Star Trek: The Original Series_ gave rise to a whole universe of spin-offs:
    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ was set approximately a century after TOS and focused on a new ship named Enterprise which was the successor to the original.
    -   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ was spun off from _The Next Generation_ while TNG was still airing. Recurring character Chief Miles O'Brien left TNG to become a main character on DS9 (and eventually main character Worf joined him), and there were substantial crossovers between the two shows in the DS9 pilot "Emissary" and the TNG episode "Birthright Part 1". Some plot threads that began on TNG later concluded on DS9, such as the political conflicts within the Klingon Empire.
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_ began almost immediately after TNG concluded, as the franchise's new "flagship show"; although it does not feature any continuing characters, it does continue various stories and themes originating from TNG and DS9. Some recurring characters from TNG continue to recur on VOY, such as Reginald Barclay and the popular Anti-Villain Q.
    -   _Star Trek: Enterprise_ was set more than 110 years before _The Original Series_, and was arguably a spinoff of TOS, TNG or both.
    -   _Star Trek: Discovery_ is set a decade before _Star Trek: The Original Series_ in its first season, and prominently features several characters who originated in TOS: Captain Christopher Pike is a main character in the second season, and characters such as Spock, Sarek, and Harry Mudd have recurring roles. The main character Michael Burnham is also Spock's adopted sister.
    -   _Star Trek: Picard_ is spun off from TNG, taking place nearly 30 years after the show ended and featuring a much older, more jaded Jean-Luc Picard.
    -   _Star Trek: Strange New Worlds_ is both a spin-off from _Discovery_ and a direct prequel to _The Original Series_, taking place on the Enterprise during Captain Pike's last five-year mission before Captain Kirk took over command. Many of the show's main characters originated on TOS either as main characters (Spock, Uhura, Chapel) or guest characters (Pike, M'Benga).
    -   Each _Star Trek_ series from TNG to ENT featured a crossover at the beginning of each new spin-off as a symbolic "passing the torch": the first episode of TNG included a cameo appearance by an aged Dr McCoy; the pilot of DS9 prominently featured Captain Picard; the first episode of VOY included a cameo by DS9's Quark; the first episode of ENT showed a video recording of Dr Zefram Cochrane, a major character in the TNG film _Star Trek: First Contact_.
-   _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody_ → _The Suite Life on Deck_, where some of the main cast move to a cruise ship to attend a special school.
-   _That's So Raven_ spun into _Cory in the House_ after a small Time Skip. _CITH_ takes place some time after _TSR_, after Raven goes to college.
-   _Three's Company_ spun off _The Ropers_ (which focuses on Helen and Stanley Roper after they sell the apartment and move away) and _Three's a Crowd_ (which dealt with Jack living with his wife Vicky and her father).
-   _The Toys That Made Us_: Series creator Brian Volk-Weiss also created a similarly-title spin-off called _The Movies That Made Us_.

-   In 2013, _Ultraman_ was awarded by the Guinness Book of World Records with the record for most spin-offs (which form the _Ultra Series_ franchise). There were 27 series in 2013, and in 2017 there were 30 series, with the number increasing with every year. Ironically, _Ultraman_ itself is a More Popular Spin Off of _Ultra Q_, but since the former show is better known worldwide, it gets the award instead.

-   _The Vampire Diaries_ → _The Originals_. The second series centred around a group of characters who had been the main arc villains in the third season of the original show.
-   The Australian game show _Hard Quiz_ was spun off from _The Weekly with Charlie Pickering_, specifically the regular segment _Hard Chat_. In one episode, a contestant's special subject was _Happy Days_, and when Tom Gleeson brought up the _Love, American Style_ example, he then went on to claim that _Hard Quiz_ was, in contrast, completely original.
-   The Walking Dead Television Universe: The mother series _The Walking Dead_ spun off into _Fear the Walking Dead_, _The Walking Dead: World Beyond_, _Tales of the Walking Dead_ and _The Walking Dead: Dead City_.
-   _The X-Files_ featured a trio of recurring characters, conspiracy theorists, known as The Lone Gunmen. They were spun off into their own short-lived eponymous show, _The Lone Gunmen_.

    Podcasts 

-   _Canceled Too Soon_:
    -   The podcast was inspired from a segment on the hosts' other (and since ended) podcast _The B Movies Podcast_, where Bibbs and Witney reviewed the first season of _Shadowhunters_ weekly.
    -   The podcast has a spin-off of its own: _All the Best_, a monthly Patreon-exclusive podcast where Bibbs and Witney review every movie nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture by year.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   The Heartland Wrestling Association was one to WCW, "Adrenaline" being one to "Nitro". Focusing mainly on developmental wrestlers who may or may not "graduate" to WCW's main roster or elsewhere, Heartland ended up running shows and training successful wrestlers well after WCW went out of business.
-   Oz Academy was originally based around Mayumi Ozaki's attempts to train new wrestlers for the Power Stable of the same name to aid her in her campaign against the GAEA promotion. After GAEA closed down, Oz Academy became increasingly self contained, though a rivalry with GAEA's would be successor Sendai Girls Pro Wrestling periodically rises to the surface. As of 2018, wrestlers associated with Oz Academy also started smashing their ways onto shows of GAEA's other would be successor, Marvelous.
-   Pro Wrestling Sem straddles the line between spinoff and B Show in regards to Pro Wrestling NOAH, focusing mainly on the misadventures of Naomichi Marufuji and KENTA as they coach rookies from the NOAH dojo in much smaller buildings than NOAH usually runs in. Mitsuharu Misawa said he got the idea from working in westside Xtreme wrestling. The show stopped happening when KENTA left NOAH.
-   Strangely, Pro Wrestling RESPECT started out as a spin off to both Ring of Honor and SHIMMER, focused mainly around the students of their academy. However, it eventually drifted into "Wrestling Is Respect", one of many "Wrestling Is" promotions that serve as spin offs to Chikara(and ended up being the longest lasting of them).
-   Inheriting its name from ECW's training facility, House Of Hardcore started doing their own shows as a spin off of Family Wrestling Entertainment, with school head Tommy Dreamer was their champion.
-   The Scotland based Insane Championship Wrestling opened a sister promotion called Fierce Females in 2012, in order to give more focus to said group. However, FF and ICW parted ways in 2014 and ICW started a women's division that ran on the same shows as all its other talent instead.
-   Ring Ka King was to be a spin off of TNA based in India, though it only lasted a single televised season.
-   New Borinquen Pro Wrestling was a developmental territory of The World Wrestling League that was based around independent circuit and former IWA Puerto Rico wrestler tryouts, in addition to a stronger focus on "strong style" (if the name didn't make that clear). It is another "farm league" that has chugged along after its larger partner closed down. And it didn't return to being its farm league when WWL started back up.
-   CZW started "Dojo Wars" in 2014, based around the students of its dojo and those (hopefully) destined for WSU's locker room. Sometimes they get into scuffles with students from other wrestling schools.
-   RISE initially started as a feeder program for SHIMMER's Sparkle Showcase but quickly became a much more ambitious project, running shows across the United States, linking up with Impact Wrestling and STARDOM, reviving Bull Nakano's feud with STARDOM executive Madusa, which in turn revived Gokumon-to and filming a weekly show.
-   All Elite Wrestling was an unintentional one to Ring Of Honor. Cody took Dave Meltzer's claim ROH couldn't draw 10,000 fans into an arena, as a challenge. But when ROH instead gave Cody and The Young Bucks the okay to try to draw a crowd that large on their own, _All In_ did just that and then some. The show's success led to the trio meeting billionare Tony Khan, and with his finances, and a roster of departing ex-ROH talent, All Elite Wrestling was formed.

    Radio 

-   The rare example of the nonfiction spinoff: _This American Life_ → _Serial_. _Serial_ takes the essential format of a _This American Life_ investigative story (which typically lasts 15-20 minutes, although sometimes it can take a whole hour) and stretches it out over a twelve-episode season's worth of 45-minute(ish) episodes. It was explicitly called a spinoff by the _TAL_ crew, features _TAL_ producer Sarah Koenig as its presenter/investigator/producer, and inherits a lot of both personnel and style from the mothership. It was also launched by a completely undisguised pilot, in which the first episode of _Serial_ was aired as an episode of _This American Life_ (Episode #537, "The Alibi").

-   _I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue_:
    -   The show was spun off from _I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again_, featuring (at first) most of the same performers (plus Humphrey Lyttelton as chairman) but in a ridiculous Panel Game rather than a Sketch Show. It has been running since 1972, far surpassing the original (which had a very respectable run itself).
    -   _I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue_ eventually got a Spin-Off of its own. In one of the games, which involves improvising a comedic dialogue that suggests the title of a book, film etc. (usually by way of an elaborate pun), one pair of contestants would usually adopt the characters of a pair of eccentric Scotsmen, exchanging numerous puns and double-entendres along the way. These characters were spun off into their own scripted comedy series, _You'll Have Had Your Tea: The Doings of Hamish and Dougal_.

    Theatre 

-   As mentioned in the description text, one of the earliest known spinoffs comes from the work of William Shakespeare: the character of Falstaff, an amalgam of several 14th- and 15th-century figures, who appeared as a secondary character in _Henry IV_ (both Part 1 and Part 2), who was given his own play in the form of _The Merry Wives of Windsor_.

    Toys 

-   In 1986, _My Little Pony_ introduced the Pony Friends, which was the Little Pony concept applied to animals that aren't ponies. The Pony Friends are part of the regular _My Little Pony_ line, but that same year a separate line was launched called _Fairy Tails_, which stars birds. It was a short-lived line. Another Spin-Off followed in 1991 with _My Pretty Mermaids_, which takes the Little Pony concept and applies it to mermaids. Of course, its launch year coincided with a development in the _My Little Pony_ lineup, namely the introduction of the Fancy Mermaid Ponies. As with _Fairy Tails_, _My Pretty Mermaids_ was short-lived. And although the three lines and their stories are separate, they do have a Recurring Element in the rainbow, which is always used as a point of reference where the characters live.

    Video Games 

-   _Ghosts 'n Goblins_'s recurring enemy the Red Arremer became such an infamous bane to arcade goers that it received its own subseries of action-RPGs, _Gargoyle's Quest_. To a lesser extent, _Maximo: Ghosts to Glory_ and its sequel are considered a Spiritual Successor to the _Ghosts 'n Goblins_ line but played in a 3D space.
-   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_ had a spin off series. _Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth_ was a mystery solving game and featured the prosecutor from the first game as the main character.

-   The _Portal_ series is a spinoff from _Half-Life_. It features new characters and setting, but has references to the events of Half-Life.
-   The _Shin Megami Tensei_ series has several concurrent timelines, with the main timeline and the _if..._/_Persona_ timeline being the most notable ones. _Nocturne_ implies that many if not all the timelines are canon within the same multiverse. _Shin Megami Tensei_ itself was a spinoff of the original _Megami Tensei_ games on the Famicom, although the name change was mostly due to trademark reasons, as the original _Megami Tensei_ was a tie-in to the first book in Aya Nishitani's _Digital Devil Story_ series.
-   The _Persona_ RPG subseries itself has multiple spin-offs. _Persona 4: Arena_ and _Persona 4: Arena Ultimax_ are fighting game sequels to _Persona 3_ and _Persona 4_, _Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight_ is a Rhythm Game side story to _Persona 3_, while _Persona 4: Dancing All Night_ is a Rhythm Game sequel to _Persona 4_, and _Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight_ is this to _Persona 5_. _Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth_ is a crossover of _Persona 3_ and _4_ with _Etrian Odyssey_\-style gameplay, and _Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth_ adds _5_ to the mix.
-   The _Dynasty Warriors_ franchise was successful enough to spawn quite a few spinoffs. The spinoffs basically just take the original mob hack'n'slash gameplay formula of Dynasty Warriors, and apply it to different settings and universes. Some of them are even licensed properties, such as anime, manga, or other video game franchises.
    -   The _Empires_ expansions are spinoffs of the main games. They contain the same hack'n'slash core gameplay for battles, but with a more strategic approach, allowing for battle formations, politics, kingdom-building, and simulation.
    -   _Samurai Warriors_ originally started as a spinoff to Dynasty Warriors. Its popularity and success has lead it to becoming its own separate series, with its own spinoffs, sequels, and expansions. Yep, this is a spinoff that spawned spinoffs of itself.
    -   _Warriors Orochi_ was a spinoff that brought the cast of Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors together.
    -   _Dynasty Warriors: Gundam_, crossed over with the Gundam franchise.
    -   _Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage_, based on Fist of the North Star.
    -   _One Piece: Pirate Warriors_, based on the popular manga One Piece.
    -   _Hyrule Warriors_, based on the _The Legend of Zelda_ franchise. It is also one to _The Legend Of Zelda_. A non-canon entry handled by Tecmo-Koei that uses gameplay similar to _Dynasty Warriors_ but with a _Zelda_ twist (like incorporating _Zelda_ items into combat). It's basically Zelda meets Dynasty Warriors.
    -   _Arslan: The Warriors of Legend_, based on the 2015 anime adaptation of _The Heroic Legend of Arslan_.
    -   _Berserk and the Band of the Hawk_, based on Berserk.
    -   _Musou Stars_ was a spinoff that incorporated characters from across Koei Tecmo's intellectual properties.
    -   _Fire Emblem Warriors_, based on the _Fire Emblem_ video game franchise. Like Zelda above, is also one to the _Fire Emblem_ franchise, as well as a non-canon entry handled by Tecmo-Koei that uses gameplay similar to _Dynasty Warriors_ but with a _Fire Emblem_ twist (like incorporating Fire Emblem strategic elements into combat). It's basically Fire Emblem meets Dynasty Warriors
-   _Gwent: The Witcher Card Game_: Popular demand for more of the sidequest Mini-Game from _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_ led to this standalone game.
-   The _Mario_ franchise has _loads_ of spinoffs, since only the mainline platformer games are officially the core installments.
    -   _Mario Kart_, _Mario Party_, _Mario Golf_ and other sports just to name a few. _Mario_ itself is a spinoff of the _Donkey Kong_ series, though the latter is treated as a spinoff of the former by most people, including Nintendo.
    -   _Luigi's Mansion_ is one starred by Mario's brother Luigi, serving as a family-friendly take on the Survival Horror genre, mixed with puzzle-solving and Defanged Horrors.
    -   The _Wario_ and _Yoshi's Island_ series are spinoffs of the _Mario_ series that have developed enough of their own identity to be considered franchises in their own right.
    -   _Super Mario 3D World_ gave Captain Toad, whom originated from _Super Mario Galaxy_, his own personal levels. They served as a sort of backdoor pilot, as they eventually spun-off into their own full-fledged game: _Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker_.
-   _Yakuza_ has several:
    -   _Judgment_, a Gaiden Game that uses the general setting of _Yakuza_ and the Tojo Clan, but none of the central characters appear besides a few shout outs here and there. The action instead focuses on disgraced lawyer turned Private Detective Takayuki Yagami as he searches through Kamurocho's underworld for a Serial Killer, while also dealing with some of the franchises trademark wackyness along the way.
    -   _Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan!_ and _Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!_, a pair of (Japan exclusive) Jidaigeki spinoffs that see the main _Yakuza_ characters taking up the roles of various real-life figures in Japanese history (with Kiryu "playing" the role of Miyamoto Musashi and Sakamoto Ryoma, respectively).
    -   _Yakuza: Dead Souls_; _Yakuza_ AS A THIRD PERSON ZOMBIE SHOOTER! Nearly became a Franchise Killer in the U.S. due to it's poor reception.
    -   _Black Panther_, another Japan exclusive for the PSP, focused on a delinquent named Tatsuya Ukyo as he tries to survive after killing a Tojo associate in a botched robbery.
    -   _Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise_, a licensed spin-off based on the _Fist of the North Star_ series, placing the characters and setting of the manga into the _Yakuza_ games' engine, with Takaya Kuroda, the voice of _Yakuza_ protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, portraying Kenshiro.
-   An interesting case with _Red Alert_, which was originally supposed to be a prequel to _Command & Conquer_. However, the tone of the game proved a little too campy for _C&C_, so it was decided to split the series, despite Kane, the Big Bad of _C&C_ being present in the original _Red Alert_. As such, both series have moved on in separate directions. Some fans speculate that the two endings of _Red Alert_ mark a Point of Divergence: the Allied victory results in the _Red Alert_ series, while the Soviet victory (where Kane makes an appearance) results in the main _C&C_ series.
-   The _Dragon Slayer_ series has split off into two seperate series: The _Xanadu_ series, and the _Legend of Heroes_ series. Both proved to be so popular that the _Dragon Slayer_ moniker is no longer used, and the _Legend of Heroes_ series even get it's _own_ More Popular Spin-Off with the _Trails_ series.
-   The arcade game _Grobda_ is a spinoff of _Xevious_, which features tank enemies called Grobdas.
-   A lesser known arcade game called _Pistol Daimyo no Bouken_ (The Adventures of Pistol Shogun), is a spinoff of the arcade game that was released in the U.S. on the Turbografx 16 as _Bravoman_, where Pistol Shogun appears as a boss.
-   _Pokémon_ has had many, _many_ spinoffs over the years.
    -   _Pokémon GO_ is an Augmented Reality game where the player has to travel around the real world to catch 'em all. The game immediately blew up in popularity, casting the largest spotlight the franchise has had on itself since the late '90s.
    -   Aside from _GO_, _Pokémon_ has had plenty of other mobile games, including _Pokémon Duel_ (a digital board game), _Pokémon Masters_ (a 3v3 game with similar combat to the main series) and _Pokémon Quest_ (an action-adventure game).
    -   The _Pokémon mini_ was an entire **console** dedicated to small _Pokémon_ spinoffs. It didn't stay on shelves long enough to get many, though.
    -   _Detective Pikachu_ is a dialogue focused mystery-adventure game where the player is tasked with solving crimes alongside the titular character. It also spawned a movie in 2019.
    -   _Pokémon Stadium_ and its Spiritual Successor, _Battle Revolution_ were recreations of the classic battle system featured in the mainline entries, but with 3D models for all of the Mons. The latter two _Stadium_ titles also had various minigames for players tired of traditional battling. These games have seemingly been discontinued after 3D models entered the main series.
    -   _Pokémon Colosseum_ and _XD: Gale of Darkness_ were, similarly to the _Stadium_ series, adaptations of the standard _Pokémon_ gameplay into 3D; however, these games also adapted the RPG progression of the main series, along with possessing a Darker and Edgier story where the player steals and rehabilitates corrupted Pokémon from the villains.
    -   _Pokémon Mystery Dungeon_, the longest running spinoff series as of now, are entries in the _Mystery Dungeon_ series of Roguelikes. The games are most well known for their narratives, putting a stronger, more emotional emphasis on their stories than most of the mainline games.
    -   _Pokémon Snap_ is a game that tasks players to take photos of Pokémon in an on-rails perspective, ranking them based on the quality of the photos.
    -   _Pokémon Trading Card Game_ is an adaptation of the Collectible Card Game of the same name, with the addition of RPG style progression and a plot in the same style as the normal games. It got a Japan only sequel, and many years later _Pokémon TCG Online_ came out, which serves as a much more direct adaptation of the card game.
    -   _Pokémon Ranger_ was a trilogy that focused on the Nintendo DS' touch screen, having the player draw circles around Pokémon to capture them and use them to bypass obstacles.
    -   _Pokémon Conquest_ is a crossover between the _Pokémon_ and _Nobunaga's Ambition_ series of games, taking the gameplay and Warring States based characters of the latter series, and putting them into a Pokémon themed plot where they fight their battles using the titular monsters.

    -   _Pokémon Dash_ is a top-down racing game where the player guides a Pikachu through checkpoints with the DS stylus.
    -   _Hey You, Pikachu!_, _Pokémon Channel_ and _PokéPark Wii_ are all Pikachu focused spinoffs aimed at younger audiences, with gameplay ranging from playing a collection of minigames, to doing different activities with Pikachu, to watching television.
    -   _Pokémon Pinball_ is exactly what you'd expect from the title. As is _Pokémon Picross_.
-   _Harvest Moon_:
    -   _Story of Seasons_ has a few spinoffs including the puzzle game _Puzzle De Harvest Moon_ and its sequel _Harvest Moon: Frantic Farming_, the 10th anniversary title _Innocent Life: A Futuristic Harvest Moon_, and the _Doraemon_ crossover _Doraemon: Story of Seasons_.

-   _Yo-kai Watch_:
    -   _Yo-kai Watch: Wibble Wobble_ is a mobile puzzle spinoff.

    -   _Yo-kai Watch World_ is a Augmented Reality game where you befriend yokai using your mobile phone.
-   _Britannic: Patroness of the Mediterranean_ is a spin-off project from the developer's main project, the currently in development Titanic Honor and Glory, produced in response to the overwhelmingly positive reception to the teams Centenary Anniversary sinking video. By happy coincidence, this Spin Off First approach acts as a sort of Demo for the main game, as it features peared down versions of the main draws of Honor and Glory, namely the tour mode of the ship recreated as accurately as possible (in this case it's a 2-for-1 deal because we get spaces and exteriors of the ship as both the hospital ship she was, and as the ocean liner she should have been), and the Real Time sinking (though in this case there are no historical figures the player can interact with).
-   _Dragon Quest IV_: Torneko went on to star in the first of Chunsoft's "Mysterious Dungeon" series of Roguelike games which first appeared on the Super NES.
-   The _Epic Battle Fantasy_ series has multiple spinoffs, one of them turning into a series of its own:

    -   _Adventure Story_

-   Object Shows:
    -   _Battle For Dream Island: All-Stars_ has _Battle For Dream Island: Moon Mix_ which happens at the same time as _All Stars_ but is disconnected from the main series and somehow outlasted it when the former is undergoing a Soft Reboot.
    -   _Battle for Object Destination_ got one with _Earthquake_ where Flip Phone (The host of the main series) gets kidnapped by another Game Show Host for their Japanese-esque game show. From there, he and five other kidnapped contestants have to solve puzzles before an earthquake hits the island they are abducted to and kills them all. Alas, neither shows lasted long after the creator was exposed for sketchy behaviors around a minor.

-   _1 Minute Melee_ is a spin-off of ScrewAttack's _DEATH BATTLE!_. While _Death Battle_ is made up of roughly 20 minute-long episodes where the hosts put exhaustive research and comparisons into two combatants and their respective strengths, skills and weaknesses, and decides the winner based on that, _OMM_ is far more simply a match-up between two fictional combatants where the fights last no longer than 60 seconds and the winner is determined by Author Appeal. It's basically meant for _DB_ fans who are Just Here for Godzilla.
-   _RWBY_ has a comedic spinoff called _RWBY Chibi_.

-   _Basic Instructions_ once played with the concept in the strip "How to Create a Spin-Off", with the idea of Butt-Monkey Rick getting his own comic.

-   _The Happy Video Game Nerd_: His 'SSFF' and 'Is it really that bad?' series of videos, usually featuring his friend Calvin. They're all improvised, edited-for-length-and-highlights videos of Derek playing various games not featured on HVGN.

    Western Animation 

-   _Family Guy_ would spawn _The Cleveland Show_, featuring Cleveland Brown, which originated from _Family Guy_.
-   _Wacky Races_ would spin off _Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines_ and _The Perils of Penelope Pitstop_ in 1969. At midseason, CBS switched _Wacky Races_, which aired at 12:30 PM ET, with _Penelope Pitstop_ (10 AM ET), essentially making the 9:30 AM time period the Dick Dastardly Hour.
-   _Arthur_ → _Postcards from Buster_. The spin-off is an extension of an _Arthur_ episode also titled "Postcards from Buster", where Buster leaves to explore the world with his father.
-   _The Flintstones_ has a spin-off called _The Pebbles & Bamm-Bamm Show_ about the children of the couples who starred in the original show.
-   The finale of _Hong Kong Phooey_ featured three inept cowboys who were unofficially named "Posse Impossible". Three years later they would get a cartoon of their own as a segment of the 1977 show _CB Bears_.
-   Cosgrove Hall did this in a conga line. _Count Duckula_ was a spin-off from _Danger Mouse_ and _Victor & Hugo_ was a spin-off from _Count Duckula._
-   Sabrina the Teenage Witch became so popular on _The Archie Comedy Hour_ that she was given her own show, _Sabrina and The Groovie Goolies_, a year later. Sabrina would star in a standalone series after that.
-   _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_ spun off _Planet Sheen_, where Sheen accidentally gets stranded on an alien planet.
-   _The Aristocats_:

-   _Dora the Explorer_ spun off _Go, Diego, Go!_ (which is about Dora's cousin who rescues wild animals) and _Dora and Friends: Into the City!_ (where Dora is aged up and has adventures with a new group of friends).
-   _Cow and Chicken_ became a three-C&C shorts show when _I Am Weasel_ broke off from it on its own.
-   _Grim & Evil_:
    -   The "Grim" part of _Grim & Evil_ would break off on its own to become _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_ while the "Evil" part became _Evil Con Carne_. _Billy & Mandy_ would have the more prolific run.
    -   _Underfist_ was a pilot for a spin-off of _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy,_ starring Hoss Delgado, Irwin, Jeffy the Spider and Fred Fredberger. It never got past the hour-long special telecast.
-   _Yogi Bear_ is probably the earliest example of a made-for-TV cartoon as it began as a segment of _The Huckleberry Hound Show_ three years earlier.

-   Some of the segments featured on _Oh Yeah! Cartoons_ were the pilots for _The Fairly OddParents!_, _My Life as a Teenage Robot_, and _ChalkZone_.

-   _The World of David the Gnome_ was spun off into _The Wisdom of the Gnomes_ with no room for crossovers since David and his wife die in the last episode of their series. Although they did make an appearance in flashback in the last episode.
-   _The Simpsons_ began life as a series of short skits on _The Tracey Ullman Show_.
-   _World of Winx_ is this to _Winx Club_.
-   The PBS Kids series _Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood_ is a spin off to _Mister Rogers' Neighborhood_ complete with a similar opening.
-   _Total Drama_:
    -   _Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race_ is a spinoff of _Total Drama_ that parodies _The Amazing Race_ instead of _Survivor_ with a different host, four of the contestants from the parent show (Noah, Owen, Geoff and Leonard) appearing as competitors, and a few cameos from or mentions of the old cast here and there.
    -   _Total DramaRama_, which was revealed on December 19, 2017 as _Total Drama Daycare_, serves as the second spinoff to _Total Drama_, adapting 11 of the original 22 contestants<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  (and Jude from _6teen_) as toddlers at a daycare run by Chef Hatchet. Like with the prior spin-off, other characters from the previous shows cameo here and there.
-   _The Amazing Spiez!_, is a spinoff of _Totally Spies!_ centered around 3 separate, younger WHOOP agents. Jerry is still featured prominently like in the core show, and Sam, Alex, and Clover occasionally have cameos in this series, but otherwise it could be argued that this is just a carbon copy of Totally Spies but with different leads and villains. The show only lasted 2 seasons before getting canceled.
-   _Unikitty!_ is another _LEGO Movie_ spin-off, featuring secondary character Unikitty.
-   Though can be surprising for some people, _Daria_ is a spin-off of _Beavis And Butthead_. She was originally a recurring classmate of theirs and would make cynical remarks about their stupidity. Her own show kicked off when her family moved from Texas to the East Coast. While _Beavis And Butthead_ may have had a larger pop culture impact, _Daria_ was a much more intelligent dramedy, examining the pains and insecurities of adolescence. To this day it retains a cult following and a very vocal fanbase.
-   _Shaun the Sheep_ is a spin-off from _Wallace & Gromit_ using the Shaun character of one of their shorts. _Shaun the Sheep_ at the same time has an spin-off with _Timmy Time_ with Timmy the lamb as the protagonist of a show for toddlers.
-   If you don't know that the _Tiny Toons_ had a spin-off series named _The Plucky Show_ with the character of Plucky as the protagonist, don't feel bad. A lot of people don't like it as the show was not very popular and ran for only one season. Although the term "spin-off" might be an overstatement considering that most of the show's epsiodes consisted in clips from the original cartoon.
-   Due to the Pinky and the Brain sketches' popularity in _Animaniacs_, a spin-off series with them was made: _Pinky and the Brain_. Then a crossover/spin-off was made, called _Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain_, with the Tiny Toons' character Elmyra in probably one of the most questioned moves ever done in animated television.
-   The common consensus among fans is to consider _Darkwing Duck_ as a spin-off of _DuckTales (1987)_ as the character of Launchpad Mc Quack appears in both but is one of the protagonists in the former. Nevertheless according to Word of God; show creator Tad Stone, _Darkwing Duck_ happens in a different universe than _DuckTales (1987)_ with Launchpad as just an alternate version. If this is canonical inside the Disney Animated Universe, of course, is up to debate.
-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_ is a spin-off of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, taking place in a parallel universe and starring the teenage human equivalents of the main characters. Word of God states that while both works are canon to each other (Sunset Shimmer was indeed Celestia's previous student, Starswirl did banish the sirens to the human world, etc.), the team deliberately avoids writing _Equestria Girls_ plots that could affect the main universe for simplicity's sake.
-   _Donald Duck_, _Goofy_, and _Pluto_ were each the stars of their own animated shorts, spinning off from the _Mickey Mouse_ shorts.
-   _Humphrey the Bear_ also was a spinoff character originating from a Goofy short to recurring in Donald Duck into his very own.
-   _Popeye_ made his first (animated) appearance in a _Betty Boop_ cartoon, before getting his own (arguably more popular) series. It should be noted that his appearance in the Betty Boop cartoon was an intentional Poorly Disguised Pilot, and that the short itself barely features her.
-   _Space Ghost Coast to Coast_, a prime-time parody talk show featuring repurposed animation from the sixties cartoon _Space Ghost_, got a spin-off called _Cartoon Planet_ starring Space Ghost, Zorak, and Brak hosting old cartoons and bantering with each other in silly skits. An ad for _Cartoon Planet_ even had the characters discussing the phenomenon of spin-offs.
    
    **Zorak:** You mean how _Cheers_ spun off into _Frasier_?  
    **Space Ghost:** Right, and _Barney Miller_ spat out _Fish_.  
    **Brak:** _Happy Days_ had a baby, and they named it _Joanie Loves Chachi_!
    
-   Once again, _Star Trek_ provides multiple entries:
    -   _Star Trek: The Animated Series_ directly continued from _Star Trek: The Original Series_ with most of the same crew.
    -   _Star Trek: Lower Decks_ is set shortly after the last TNG film, _Star Trek: Nemesis_, and departs from tradition by following a group of low-level ensigns on an unremarkable starship doing mop-up for the more glamourous crews featured in other shows. There have been a handful of cameos from previous series to date, as well as a wealth of references to past events and characters.
    -   _Star Trek: Prodigy_ is set a few years after _Star Trek: Voyager_ in the same part of the galaxy, and has a hologram version of Captain Janeway from VOY as one of its main characters.
-   _Rintindumb_: The show is a spin-off of the _Lucky Luke_ comics starring Luke's dog, Rantanplan, known as "Rintindumb" here. It mainly shows little snippets where Rintindumb does something to live up to his given name.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_ has had two spin-offs. _Kamp Koral_ is about a younger SpongeBob and his friends at a summer camp. _The Patrick Star Show_ has Patrick and a cast of new characters as his family — it's much Denser and Wackier than the original show. While the focus is mainly on Patrick, SpongeBob is a recurring character.
-   Like _Happy Days_ listed above in the live-action series folder, _Wait Till Your Father Gets Home_ was a spin-off of _Love, American Style_.
