Aladdin gets away with breaking staff protocols.

A villain can use any weapon against the side of good, whether it be a gun, a supernatural/magical item, an electronic or whatever item you can use as a weapon. The hero stands no chance against this weapon and it becomes apparent that there is only one thing to do in a situation like this, they must destroy the weapon.

Destroying the weapon can cause a whole lot of things to happen, like if the villain's power stems from the weapon if it is magical/supernatural, so destroying it will cause the villain to lose that power and also can cause whatever magical/supernatural influence the weapon has caused to be un-done. As for any normal weapons like guns and tanks, they can be destroyed through realistic means like being melted, blown up, etc. They can also be destroyed through mundane means as well like a hammer.

The villain's reaction can be anything from breaking down into a sobbing mess if he/she loved that weapon to a Villainous Breakdown as a Berserk Button had been pressed to mild annoyance and finding a Plan B to indifferent shrugging and switching to fisticuffs or another weapon to having an Oh, Crap! moment. A rare reaction is gratitude if the weapon was mind-controlling him or her.

Bottom line: these are instances where the villain has a weapon that gets destroyed and it can cause the good side to gain an advantage against them.

Compare to Wrecked Weapon, which only applies to _heroes_ whose weapons get wrecked. For the case of handguns, see Disarm, Disassemble, Destroy.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _My-Otome_ has two examples:
    -   Tomoe's Valkyrie spear is broken in Episode 22 when Miyu rushes in to stop her from killing Arika.
    -   In episode 25, she chases after Arika to avenge her previous loss, only to wind up on the losing side again as Arika, with her Robe's true powers awakened, unintentionally destroys Tomoe's armor when she crafts a barrier to protect herself.
-   _One Piece_: Subverted during Luffy's battle with Don Krieg. Krieg attacks with his Mighty Battle Spear, a weapon that explodes on impact. Luffy makes several attacks aimed specifically at the tip of the spear, eventually destroying it. Once the spear's point is destroyed, Luffy taunts Krieg by telling him his power's been cut in half now that his Mighty Battle Spear is just a bomb on a stick. The subversion is that a bomb on a stick is _still_ a pretty good weapon, which Krieg continues to use until Luffy's attacks near the end of the fight knock it out of his hands.

    Fan Works 

-   In the penultimate chapter of the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfic _House of the Crystal Sun_, the villain's MacGuffin, which is the titular object, ends up accidentally being destroyed by his henchman when said henchman becomes a giant.
-   _Super RWBY Sisters_: At the end of "Partners In Time", Master Hand crushes Adam's sword after curb-stomping the villain.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Aladdin_: Aladdin notices Jafar using his Serpent Staff to brainwash the Sultan, so he takes it and destroys it (as pictured above). Not that it matters though, because once Jafar uses the Genie to wish to become the most powerful sorcerer in the world, he magically gains a new staff.
-   Played with in _BoBoiBoy: The Movie_. Bora Ra delivers his most devastating attacks with a large black-hole-powered hammer, with which he absorbs BoBoiBoy into, seemingly sealing his fate. However, BoBoiBoy breaks out by splitting into 5, destroying the hammer in the process.
-   Subverted somewhat hilariously in _Kung Fu Panda 2_, when Po and the Furious Five manage to destroy what they think is Lord Shen's cannon... which is actually a miniature replica for the real deal, which they end up destroying anyway, only for Shen to reveal he has countless more already mass-produced. However, it then gets played straight when Po uses his newly-gained inner peace powers to decimate all of Shen's cannons, ending their threat there and then for good.
-   _The Loud House Movie_: Lincoln and Lily manage to get the dragon gem away from Morag and have Lela the Dragon burn it so it can never be used again.

-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_:
    -   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Rainbow Rocks_: The Rainbooms and Sunset Shimmer manage to make a rainbow beam big enough to defeat the sirens and destroy their pendants that enable their powers. Not only have they lost their magic, but also their ability to sing afterward.
    -   Becomes a recurring feature in later installments, as the majority of villains of the series are empowered by magical artifacts; destroying the Memory Stone, Vignette's enchanted smartphone and the Time Twirler resolves the predicaments of each of the entries they're featured in. Played with in _Magical Movie Night_, where destroying the mirror will depower the villain, but Starlight has to avoid doing so for as long as she can as Sunset and her friends are trapped inside it, with unknown consequences for what would happen if they weren't extracted first.
-   Dr. Facilier from _The Princess and the Frog_ has a voodoo charm which, when it contains a blood sample from another person, will cause the wearer of the charm to take on the appearance of that person. However, it also acts as a Soul Jar and as shown in the end, if it is destroyed, his "Friends on the Other Side" will drag him into their dimension since the destruction of his charm means he is unable to give them the souls of everyone in New Orleans like he promised.
-   _The Sponge Bob Movie Sponge Out Of Water_: During the climax, Burgerbeard's magic book is burned on his stove, rendering it useless.
-   Rothbart from _The Swan Princess_ had the necessities needed for the Forbidden Arts, but they were destroyed in the movie's opening by the royal guards when he was about to use them to overthrow King William.
-   _Tarzan_: During his final battle against Clayton, Tarzan manages to get his hands on Clayton's gun. Clayton goads Tarzan to shoot him, sneering at him to be a man, but Tarzan destroys the gun instead.

-   Like the original animated movie, _Aladdin_ destroys Jafar's Serpent Staff, though again once Jafar wishes to become a powerful sorcerer, he gains a new one, rendering the destruction moot.
-   _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_: Peter distracts the Big Bad Ronan in order for the rest of his team to use a space gun to destroy his Warhammer, which was empowered by the Power Stone.
-   DC Extended Universe:
    -   In _Justice League_, Superman freezes Steppenwolf's axe with his breath, and then Wonder Woman shatters it with her sword.
        -   In _Zack Snyder's Justice League_, Superman only needs a small puff instead of a sustained breath to freeze Steppenwolf's axe (unlike the above theatrical cut), and he shatters the weapon himself with a small punch afterwards.

-   _Star Wars_:
    -   During the climax of _Star Wars: The Phantom Menace_, Obi-Wan Kenobi slices Darth Maul's double-bladed lightsaber in half, leaving him to continue fighting with the half that's still functioning. Downplayed Trope, as Maul is no less dangerous with just a single blade.
    -   Similarly, in _Revenge of the Sith_, Mace Windu sends Darth Sidious scrambling when he manages to knock the Sith Lord's lightsaber out the window (in some adaptations, he cuts it in half as well). Unfortunately, Sidious also has some built-in weaponry.
    -   The Rebels/Resistance destroying either of the Death Stars or Starkiller Base counts as well. They count as weapons (albeit absurdly huge) that the bad guys have in their possession, and "not being blown to smithereens" is a pretty big advantage for the good guys.
-   _Tales from Muppetland: The Frog Prince_: Taminella, the evil witch who cursed both Sir Robin (the titular frog prince) and Princess Melora (whom she cursed to speak in Spoonerisms so she couldn't tell her father Taminella's true identity), gets her powers from the crystal ball at the end of her staff. Robin, who is the only one who understands Melora, finally figures out that her warning to "bake the hall in the candle of her brain" means "break the ball in the handle of her cane."

-   _Young Jedi Knights_: During their final duel in _Jedi Under Siege_, Luke defeats Brakiss by slashing off the top two inches or so of his lightsaber, leaving him weaponless. Brakiss quickly replaces it with a mass-produced one on his return to the Shadow Academy though.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Power Rangers,_ the Red Ranger frees the Green Ranger from Rita's mind control by destroying the Sword of Darkness with his Blade Blaster. Fridge Logic kicks in when viewers remember that Tommy's mind control wasn't connected to the Sword of Darkness, but it worked anyway.
    -   This is very common in monster battles. This can produce a range of reactions, Slippery Shark was pissed when the Megazord cut his boomerang in half, while Samurai Fan Man was entirely indifferent to his samurai lance being broken and he just pulls out the fan and almost wins. Many monsters however switch to more magic or melee based attacks.
    -   Played with in the Robogoat battle. He was winning but the Rangers were getting a few punches in with the Thunder Megazord. After a brief combat with their sword against his Rod of Destruction, they chop it in half and instead of being weakened, he switches to an energy blast barrage that knocks over the Thunder Megazord and damages the controls although he eventually has an Oh, Crap! moment after it gets up and charges up the thunder sabre.
    -   In the rematch with Rito after getting Ninjazords, initially they're winning but he turns the tide by breaking out a flamethrower, none of the individual zords have an answer for it, so they form the Ninja Megazord. After he misses when firing at it, they use the finisher to break his flamethrower, which is responded to with an angry "Hey!", they then form the Ninja Mega Falconzord to finish the job (Rito retreats after being hit with the finisher).
-   _Smallville_: In "Spell", Clark Kent faces a trio of evil witches who depend on a spellbook. He is defeated the first time due to his weakness to magic. In the rematch, he immediately blasts the spellbook with his heat vision and reduces it to ash, defeating them.
-   _Ultra Series_:
    -   _Ultraman X_: During the crossover episode where the Ultramen team consisting of Victory, Ginga, and X battles the Specter siblings, Mold Specter becomes even stronger when his brother and sister, Juda and Gina, transform themselves respectively into his sword and ax which he Dual Wields. But Ginga and Victory manage to turn the tide by aiming their energy beams at Mold's weapons, destroying his sword and ax and leaving Mold exposed to Ultraman X's counterattack.
    -   _Ultraman Geed_: In order to stop Belial once and for all, Geed makes sure to obliterate his Giga Battle Nizer in their final battle, depowering Belial out of his Atrocious form in the process and depriving him of one of his game-changing weapons, though Geed still has to normally confront Belial before defeating him for good.
-   _VR Troopers_: Double subverted with Gunslinger, blasting his gun and knocking away his sword didn't faze him as he had another weapon, but he had a Villainous Breakdown when a midair flying kick shorted out his shield.
    -   Downplayed in Shaider (one of the source material shows for VR Troopers) when there was a turtle monster battling Shaider, at the end of the battle, Shaider destroyed his trident by cutting off the side tips and turning it into a spear, likely to humiliate the monster by asserting dominance more than disarm it, showing it that its weapon was useless against his, then eventually after the monster dropped the spear that remained of his trident, Shaider grabbed it and the turtle monster was Impaled with Extreme Prejudice with his own weapon before being finished off before he could pull it out.

    Theme Parks

After its destruction, Stroggos becomes more vulnerable as a planet, and (after all is said and done in _II_) allows the entirety of sequel _Quake IV_ to happen.
-   _Sniper Elite 4_: There are two possible methods to destroy General Bohm's jet bomber. The first is to shoot out both its engines.

Either way, the plane goes down, killing the Big Bad, and Operation _Avalanche_ goes as planned.

Not only is firebending Ozai's main weapon, it is also his main status claim within the Fire Nation hierarchy, whose institutions are specifically set up for the strongest firebenders to rise to the top. By turning Ozai into a muggle, Aang permanently strips him of his status and creates an opening for Ozai's son Zuko, a friend of Aang and the next-strongest firebender in the line of succession, to take over as the new Fire Lord and to steer his nation away from his ancestors' aggressive ways.

Conan and his friends actually do manage to get the ring from him several times, but since depowering The Dragon would end the show, Wrath-Amon always manages to get it back before the end of the episode... at least until their final fight in the penultimate episode. The ring is ultimately not destroyed until _after_ Wrath-Amon is bested and turned into a harmless, non-sentient lizard.

However, as the war went on, and the Vengeance weapons began making an appearance, the Allies began targeting those sites as well. This proved difficult to accomplish, as the bombs weren't dropped with the best accuracy, and the equipment was often moved before the strike could arrive.
