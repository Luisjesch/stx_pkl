_**CHAAAAAAAARGE!**_

_"Love is like a rhino, short-sighted and hasty; if it cannot find a way, it will **make** a way."_

When portrayed in the media, rhinos are always hulkingly big, heavy, and intimidating herbivores that are known to have bad eyesight, short tempers, and a tendency to run down and trample (or gore to death) things that piss them off. They're not very smart, but they always use their heads. They are one of the truly tank-like species of animal in the world. If they appear in a game, expect a Smash Mook or maybe a Bullfight Boss. If they are in a group, they are likely to go on an Animal Stampede. If they're depicted in fiction, they're likely to be a dangerous obstacle. If it's a comedy, expect to see someone sent flying.

When a character is based on a rhinoceros, expect a tough brute capable of a lot of violence. If the character is a good guy, expect a lot of trampled Mooks. If the character is a bad guy, expect running. Lots and lots of running. Traditionally, rhinos were sometimes used as the Unpleasant Animal Counterpart to the Honorable Elephant and Huggy, Huggy Hippos, though the latter's capacity to be aggressive and dangerous has become more emphasized in later media.

In Real Life, a rhinoceros is essentially an armor-plated cow (though as an odd-toed ungulate, it's more closely related to the horse and the tapir). It isn't anywhere near as aggressive or mindlessly violent as it's been portrayed in the media. It can still be a dangerous animal, but by far more humans are killed each year by elephants and hippopotami (and cows). In fact, humans are probably more dangerous to it because all of the living species of rhino are endangered due to poaching and habitat loss. Baby rhinos are especially vulnerable and need to be watched and cared for 24/7, otherwise they'll literally die from the stress of being alone.

Fun fact: A group of rhinos is called a "crash". Three guesses why (and the first two don't count)...

When a more exotic, powerful or environment-specific variant is desired, woolly rhinos or elasmotheres may sometimes be used in lieu of the regular sort. The other well-known kind of prehistoric rhino, the gigantic _Paraceratherium_, is the odd exception to this trope, due to its lack of horns and resemblance to giraffes.

Not to be confused with the Rhino tank in the _Grand Theft Auto_ series. Despite the fact that a good deal of players spent most or all of their playtime spawning a Rhino with a cheat code and going on a rampage.

See also Brutish Bulls and Full-Boar Action for similarly violent and aggressive fictional ungulates and Temper-Ceratops for horned dinosaurs with similar stock behaviors. Contrast Honorable Elephant and Huggy, Huggy Hippos, since rhinos are often portrayed as the Unpleasant Animal Counterpart to elephants and hippos (which is ironic since, as mentioned above, elephants and hippos are more dangerous than rhinos). However, elephants and hippos are not immune to this portrayal themselves.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Shows up in a few _Doraemon_ films.
    -   While the gang explores the African jungles in _Doraemon: Nobita and the Haunts of Evil_, Gian complains the trip to too "boring" and "where are all the wild beasts"?

    -   _Doraemon: Nobita and the Island of Miracles ~Animal Adventure~_ have Gian and Suneo running afoul of a woolly rhinoceros while exploring the island, which chases after them until they climbed up a tree. Doraemon comes to the rescue in time, but the rhino then accidentally destroyed the Anywhere Door, preventing the gang from using that gadget later on.
-   _Mazinger Z_: Mechanical Beast Toros D7 resembled a mix between rhino and bull: it was four-legged, its body was armor-plated, and above its head it had a huge horn. It attacked charging at its adversary and impaling it or goring it with its large horn.
-   _Naruto_: One of the summons of Pain's Animal Path is a giant rhino, using it to rampage in the building of Konoha's Intelligence Division. He later uses it to attack Sage Mode Naruto, who grabs it by the horn and tosses it into the air.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   One of Zoro's attacks is named "Sai Kuru" (Wheeling Rhino), and was also translated as "Rhino Rampage" in the 4Kids dub of _Grand Adventure_.

-   In _Pokémon Origins_, during Red's Final Battle with Giovanni, Giovanni's first Pokémon is a Rhyhorn which is unusually strong, being able to easily beat four-sixths of Red's team (Victreebel, Kabutops, Snorlax and Jolteon) before tying with Hitmonlee when the Fighting-type's Mega Kick collides with Rhyhorn's Horn Drill despite the fact that in the games, Victreebel would be able to one-shot Rhyhorn all by itself and the Spikes Pok´mon beats Jolteon with a Thunderbolt despite its 30 special in the Gen 1 games. Giovanni's second and final Pokémon is a Rhydon which puts up a good fight against Charizard until Charizard dodges Horn Drill and takes down Rhydon with Seismic Toss.
-   One of the earlier creatures in _Toriko_ is the "Dom", a massive, long-tailed rhinoceros-like animal with plenty of spikes, capable of demolishing a whole building with a single charge. And it's far from being the most dangerous beast in that biotope.

    Asian Animation 

-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_: In episode 22, Weslie disguises a sleeping rhino as a goat to trick Wolnie. When Wolnie attacks him, the rhino wakes up and immediately gets angry at her, chasing her and Wolffy down without a second thought.

    Card Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
    -   Rhinos have been a predominantly Green creature type since Crash of Rhinos from Mirage, and often get the keyword Trample (meaning that if they deal more damage to a creature than would kill it they deal the rest of it to the defending player as if they had steamrolled right over their target), and occasionally an ability limiting the other player's ability to block them.
        -   The biggest rhino in the game comes from _Khans of Tarkir_ in the form of Siege Rhino, one of the huge war beasts used by the Abzan Houses.
        -   There are also the Rhox, humanoid rhinoceri from Alara that unlike their bestial cousins lean towards White, the color of order, and are known for being fearsome, unwavering soldiers and knights. Some also live in New Capenna, where they're mostly associated with the Riveteers as workers and the Brokers as enforcers. Most of the other ones we see are prizefighters or private security.
    -   Although they're only typed as regular Beasts, the krushoks of Tarkir resemble massive, one-horned rhinos and are mostly known for their great strength and extremely foul tempers.

    Comic Books 

-   _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_' Ixis Naugus is one third bat, one third rhinoceros, and one third lobster.
-   Rhino, one of Spider-Man's central rogues is infamous for charging straight to his opponents as one of his primary means of combat and of course, while donning a heavily armored rhinoceros suit.
-   _Usagi Yojimbo_: Gen, a rhino bounty hunter, is consistently shown to be a very aggressive and skilled offensive swordsman, but he often flounders against fighters like Zato-ino and Inazuma, who are equally skilled and more well-rounded.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Kung Fu Panda_ Fic _A Different Lesson_, Commander Vachir shows a lot more of his combat skills than in canon, especially when possessed by BigBad Heian Chao. He actually manages to Curb-Stomp Battle Tai Lung initially. And that's not even getting into the undead Anvil of Heaven, AKA. Tai Lung's former guards.
-   In the _Harry Potter_ fanfic "The Lie I've Lived," Harry conjures a rhino and rides it _through_ the Triwizard obstacle course. While the other champions are slowed down by the obstacles, he uses the rhino like a living tank/battering ram.
-   In the _Prehistoric Park_/_Walking with…_ crossover fanfic _Prehistoric Earth_, both species of ice age rhino rescued, plus a brontothere species and even a herd of arsinoitherium, prove incredibly vicious and aggressive, the males especially so, at the sight of the rescue team in their territories while in their home time periods. The subsequent territorial rages they undergo prove very useful for the team in allowing the beasts to end up charging straight through the portal to the titular zoo.
-   The subsequent Continuity Reboot of _Prehistoric Earth_, _Prehistoric Park Reimagined_, similarly features prehistoric rhino and brontothere species that prove incredibly ill-tempered and charge happy at the sight of territorial intrusions by the rescue team over the course of their rescues.

    Films — Animated 

-   Carl and Frank from _Ice Age_, a pair of brontotheres, which despite their appearances, aren't even actual rhinos at all (though they are distantly related). True to form, they're both portrayed as brutish thugs, and they get trounced by Manny the mammoth.
-   _Kung Fu Panda_ completely inverts this. Tai Lung goes on a rampage and thrashes Commander Vachir and all 1,000 of his rhino guards without even breaking a sweat.
    -   _Kung Fu Panda 2_ likewise gives us Master Thundering Rhino, son of famed Master Flying Rhino. Sadly, he pretty much just exists so Shen's cannon can kill someone strong as proof of its power. Overall, it seems as though rhinos in the _Kung Fu Panda_ universe exist _solely_ to provide The Worf Effect.
-   In _The Lion King II: Simba's Pride_, Kovu and Kiara scare away some birds so Timon and Pumbaa can eat the worms. Unfortunately, the birds happen to have a herd of angry rhinos on their side and like the wildebeests from the original, the rhinos stampede after Kiara and Kovu. Thankfully, no one got trampled!
-   _NIMONA (2023)_: The first animal form Nimona takes to reveal her Shapeshifting powers to Ballister is a rhinoceros. And sure enough, she uses it to cause quite the damage in the castle (though she also turned into other species during her rampage, including smaller ones).
-   The halberd-carrying Mooks of Prince John in _Robin Hood (1973)_ are rhinos. They are not portrayed as terribly bright, but they have a mean charge.
-   _The Sword in the Stone_: The second to last animal Madam Mim turns into during the Wizard Duel is a pink rhinoceros, who is then head-butted off a cliff and into a river by Merlin (now turned into a billy goat), but then Mim comes out in the form of a...

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Subverted with the battle-rhinoceros from _300_. If the Persians had been fighting anyone other than the frigging **Spartans**...
-   _Attack of the Clones_ have a three-horned alien beast called a Reek in the Arena battle, who nearly trampled over Anakin until he used the Force to tame the beast. The same animal went on a rampage later in the film and nearly tramples over Mace Windu and Jango Fett until Mace severs one of the Reek's front tusks via lightsaber followed by Jango Fett putting it down with a single shot.
-   _Avatar_ has the Hammerhead Titanotheres, enormous six-legged rhino-like alien beasts with a massive flat horn resembling a hammerhead shark's snout (hence their name) and a colorful frill atop their heads used for signaling and as a threat display.
-   In _Black Panther (2018)_, Wakanda has _trained attack rhinos_!
-   _The Chronicles of Narnia_ features a rhinoceros intentionally charging ahead of the centaur General Oreius in order to save King Peter from the advancing hordes of the White Witch. The beast handily tosses aside several attackers before being brought down.
-   An Erumpent (see below in Literature) goes around rampaging in New York in the first _Fantastic Beasts_ movie, after it escapes Newt's suitcase.
-   This trope was going to be used in _Gladiator_, but eventually decided against the idea. There were a few reasons for this, mainly lack of time and money, but also because of how unbelievable it is in real life, as the summary above mentions.
-   _The Gods Must Be Crazy_ features a rhino going around stomping out fires the characters have set up; the Narrator claims that rhinos are like the fire marshals of the forest. _The Gods Must Be Crazy II_ features a rhino charging the female lead for getting between it and its baby.
-   A rhino is the occupant on one of the cars in the circus train at the start of _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_. When the action taking place on the roof of the car annoys it, it smashes its horn through the roof and comes very close to hitting Indy somewhere sensitive.
-   _Jumanji_ features several summoned rhinos, including one that casually shoulders aside a police car. This particular rhino gets its own gameplay mechanic in the tie-in board game. Simply put, when you land on a space with a rhino on it, you can use the rhino to block your adversaries' path. Subverted with another member of the rhino herd, a short, overweight specimen whose lumbering walk and weary, huffing breath are Played for Laughs. _Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle_ features a herd of albino rhinos during the sequel's group trip to return the Jaguar's Eye to the Jaguar statue.
-   In _Prehistoric Women_, Queen Kari later meets her fate Impaled with Extreme Prejudice on the horn of the rampaging white rhino.

    Folklore 

-   Several cultures have folk tales that tell of a rhinoceros putting out a raging fire. By trampling it under its feet.
    -   As noted above, _The Gods Must Be Crazy_ features an example of this.
    -   It is used again in an episode of _The Simpsons_ as a Deus ex Machina.
    -   Conversely, in heraldry they're sometimes depicted as breathing fire like mammalian dragons.
-   It's generally believed unicorns were based on garbled descriptions of rhinos, which likely explains why in many descriptions of them from antiquity describe unicorns as being of aggressive temperament.

    Literature 

-   The _Animorphs_ often favored morphing into rhinos (and elephants) for situations requiring lots of collateral damage. Jake originally acquired his when he needed to smash through the walls of a heavily guarded compound, and Marco got one in book 22 for pretty much the same reason (though he only ever used it that one time).
    -   Though the rhinos (the real ones or the instincts of the ones they morphed) weren't portrayed as being aggressive or mean, they were just _really_ tough.
-   The _Babar_ series gave us Rataxes, the aggressive King of Rhinoland and Babar's arch-rival. That the Rhinos have a destructive holiday called (you guessed it) the "Rhino Rampage" makes things all the more troperiffic!
-   In _Bravelands_, some rhinos resent elephants for having the Great Mother as their matriarch. They even start acting aggressive towards Sky the elephant for stumbling across them and refuse to let her speak reasonably. A case of rhinos actually charging is when Fearless the lion stumbles across a rhino herd while on his travels. The rhinos' aggressive reputation gets harder in _Code Of Honor_, where it's revealed that Stronghide had murdered the Great Mother, though goaded into doing so by Stinger. Also in this book, Stronghide boasts that a rhino can easily replace an elephant as a Great Parent and is even willing to become the Great Father of the Bravelands.
-   The old children's series _Abelard and Liverwurst_ is about a farmer (Abelard) who finds a baby rhino (Liverwurst) after the latter falls off a circus train. A monster that terrorizes farms and towns in the first book turns out to be Liverwurst's mother, who's angry because she thinks someone kidnapped her baby.
-   _Clue_: In the _Midnight Phone Calls_ chapter "The Guest Who Couldn't Shoot Straight", a vicious rhino escapes from the nearby zoo and shows up at the mansion, trying to attack the guests and briefly getting stuck in the outside wall of the Billiard Room.
-   Woolly rhinos crop up a few times in the _Earth's Children_ series. In all cases, they are described as being stubborn, unpredictable and vicious:
    -   Broud, the main antagonist of _The Clan of the Cave Bear_, has a woolly rhinoceros totem. His personality traits include impulsiveness, being quick to anger and resenting those (especially Ayla) who detract attention from him.
    -   In _The Valley of Horses_, Thonolan is gored by a woolly rhino, leading to him and Jondalar meeting the Sharamudoi, the tribe into which Thonolan marries.
    -   Towards the end of their post-Matrimonial isolation in _The Shelters of Stone_, Ayla and Jondalar come across a group of adolescent boys baiting a woolly rhino. Needless to say, none of the boys have any experience hunting rhinos and one of them ends up getting injured.
-   The Erumpent in Harry Potter's _Fantastic Beasts_ is basically a rhinoceros whose horn is Made of Explodium.
-   At the start of _James and the Giant Peach_, both of James' parents are killed (check that, eaten) by an escaped rhino. The Film of the Book makes it worse. The Rhino is basically turned into an Eldritch Abomination made of clouds that represents all of James' fears.
-   _Journey to the West_: In one of their last adventures, Sun Wukong and co. encountered a trio of rhinoceros demons who impersonated Buddhas to steal sacred lamp oil from monasteries. They ended up pursuing the monsters into the ocean where they had to muster up some of the Dragon King's army and a few of the constellation gods to help defeat them.
-   In the _Just-So Story_ "How the Rhinoceros Got his Skin", the titular rhino is a foul-tempered, bullying Jerkass.
-   _Katt Loves Dogg_: Oscar and Molly find out they're in the rhino sector of Eastern Wilderness Reserve when an angry rhino chases them. When they cross into katt territory, he angrily orders them not to come back, then decides to spite them by making a lot of noice to alert all the katts of a dogg (Oscar) being in their sector.
-   The rhino from _My Father's Dragon_. He's quite fierce and angry, but he mostly just wants people to stay out of his weeping pool.
-   _A Porcupine Named Fluffy_ features a rhinoceros character with the name of... ...Hippo. He starts out very antagonistic, threatening to give Fluffy "a rough time," but eventually, he and the little porcupine bond over their contradictory names.
-   _The Reluctant King_: The unicorn inside the Grandduke's menagerie is actually an elasmotherium, or wooly rhinoceros.
-   There's a lesser-known Little Golden Books title from the early 1960s, _Rupert the Rhinoceros_ (which was also adapted into a Golden Book Video in 1985) that has a realistic version of this trope. Rupert keeps charging whenever someone comes near, and after this gets him into a car accident when he ends up in the city (after a series of silly events), the doctor tests his eyesight and diagnoses that he can't see very well, thus prompting Rupert to get nervous and charge, just like in real life. So the doctor prescribes Rupert a pair of eyeglasses to improve his vision and all is well.
-   _Safari_: In chapter 5, Henson's and Mansfield's group comes across a rhinocerous dozing in some shrubbery. They all try to sneak past it without disturbing it, but the wind blows their scent in its direction, waking it up and alerting it to intruders. It immediately charges, scattering the natives they got to carry their stuff.
-   Douglas Adams's unfinished novel _The Salmon of Doubt_ has a chapter written from the point of view of a rhino which escapes from a zoo and goes on a rampage, killing several people before being shot to death.
-   In _Son of Spellsinger_, the young travelers recruit an alcoholic rhino as both transport and bodyguard. When he's not drunk off his feet, he's an armor-wearing badass.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Remember _Ace Lightning_, one of the live action CGI hybrid pioneers? One of Ace's enemies was a Rhino-headed Monster named Anvil, who was physically the strongest character, and had an anvil for a hand.
-   In _Only Fools and Horses_ episode "Video Nasty", Rodney is trying to come up with an idea for a feature film. Del suggests _There's a Rhino Loose in the City_. Once the sheer implausibility of this is explored (How do you lose a rhino and not notice? Where would it hide? And what is it doing in the city?), a deflated Del sarcastically suggests that they change the title to _There's a Rhino Loose out in the Sticks Where No Sod Lives_.
-   The Judoon, from _Doctor Who_, are a race of humanoid rhinoceros Space Police. They're depicted as extremely blunt and no-nonsense, which at worst results in a Judge, Jury, and Executioner attitude.
-   _Kamen Rider_:
    -   Kamen Rider Thrust from _Kamen Rider Dragon Knight_ and his Japanese counterpart Gai from _Kamen Rider Ryuki_ have a rhino motif and use the Advent Beast Metalgelas, a hulking humanoid armored rhino.
    -   Kamen Rider OOO has the Rhinoceros as one of his Core Medals, which naturally grants him a big horn for headbutts. It's partnered with two other heavy mammals (Gorilla and Elephant), which let OOO assume Sagohzo Combo, a Mighty Glacier with gravity powers.
-   _Prehistoric Park_: In "A Mammoth Undertaking", when Nigel goes back to Ice Age Siberia to find a mammoth to take back to the park, he runs afoul of a bull _Elasmotherium_, which is noted to be — much like modern rhinoceri — prone to charging down anything that surprises it. Nigel later uses this to his advantage by goading the beast into charging him and following him through the time portal, allowing him to get it to the present and into the park.
-   _Pushing Daisies_. The episode "Window Dressed to Kill" has Ned resurrecting a dead rhinoceros named Aloysius for no reason really connected to the plot. But a rampaging rhinoceros is always badass...
-   _Super Sentai_ / _Power Rangers_:
    -   _Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger_ / _Power Rangers Wild Force_ features a Rhino-Armadillo tagteam as part of the season's enormous Mecha Expansion Pack. The Rhino forms an alternative set of legs for the combined mecha, which _kicks_ the Armadillo at the enemy as part of a soccer-themed finishing move.
    -   Those two may or may not have been a Shout-Out to two American-exclusive monsters from the original _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_, the American Football\-themed Rhinoblaster & the Association Football\-themed Soccadillo.
    -   Dominic, the second extra Ranger in _Power Rangers Jungle Fury_, channels the power of the rhino. Ironically, while the rhino's raw strength is played up as unrivaled in the animal kingdom, Dominic is more of The Trickster than The Big Guy you'd expect. His Japanese counterpart, Ken from _Juken Sentai Gekiranger_, is much the same.
    -   Misao Mondo, Zyuoh The World of _Doubutsu Sentai Zyuohger_, has this as his primary animal motif, though he also comes with crocodile and wolf motifs, modes, and mecha. Interestingly, it's the Jack of All Stats, while the crocodile represents raw brute strength. He can only do the typical ramming attack when empowered by all three of his animals. Likewise ( once freed from his brainwashing), his personality is more of a socially and emotionally insecure man.
    -   _Choujuu Sentai Liveman_ gives us our first rhino-themed ranger, Jun'ichi Aikawa/Green Sai ("sai" being Japanese for "rhino"), a high school rugby player intent on avenging the death of his sister at the hands of the Big Bad. He also has a brotherly relationship with Black Bison Tetsuya Yano.
-   _Walking with Beasts_: One of the animals featured in the Ice Age episode is a European woolly rhino, a _Coelodonta antiquitatis_. It features only in one scene, where it spots a passing neanderthal man while grazing, charges him down and hurls him over its shoulder after snagging him with its horns. Luckily, the neanderthal's sturdy body allows him to survive his ordeal.

    Magazines 

-   The "Rhinos" issue of ZooBooks theorizes that this trope may be the result of a rhino's poor eyesight: when you can't tell if something is a threat, it's better to charge at it just to be safe. Accompanying this text is an illustration of a black rhino charging a speeding jeep. Another page has this illustration of a mother rhino attacking a tiger that wanted her baby.

    Music 

-   Rhino Records has their mascot named Rocky, a rhino done up in full Greaser Delinquent regalia.

    Other 

-   An old Russian joke: "Rhinos have bad eyesight, but given their weight it's not their problem".

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Terry Gerin, aka Rhino/Rhyno, who has found success in ECW, WWE and TNA. A powerhouse wrestler, his Signature Move is a running tackle called _The Gore_.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Champions Universe features a villain named Ironhorn, who is basically a Captain Ersatz of Marvel's Rhino.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The Rhek are a race of hulking, anthropomorphic, Lawful Good humanoid rhinos. Their entry included one with levels in the Monk class. That's right, not only is this one a badass man-rhino, but it knows kung-fu.
    -   Normal rhinos and prehistoric woolly rhinos are often statted up in _Monster Manuals_ as among the more dangerous regular animals players can run into.
-   The _Fighting Fantasy_ series features Rhino-Men as the mooks of Big Bad Balthus Dire.
-   _Pathfinder_:
    -   Regular and woolly rhinoceri, as well as elasmotheres, feature as possible enemies and tend to be among the more dangerous of the regular animals players are likely to encounter. They tend to be quite aggressive, and to attack with little or no provocation.
    -   Fire giants are known to build iron rhinoceri, constructs resembling enormous metallic rhinoceri with blazing furnaces in their bellies and smokestack horns, wrapped in coils of prehensile chains and animated by the bound spirits of actual rhinos. They are infamous for their terrible tempers, intense aggression and propensity for viciously attacking anyone who isn't their master or some type of giant, and are very popular among fire giant kings and warlords as powerful battle mounts and Siege Engine/Beast of Battle crosses.
-   _Warhammer_ and _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   All Juggernauts of Khorne are unholy rhino-shaped amalgamations of daemon, metal, and hellfire, and, like all of Khorne's daemons, are locked in a state of perpetual homicidal fury. The Blood Crushers are especially large versions.
    -   Warhammer Fantasy also has "Rhinoxen" as the answer to the question "what the hell could an Ogre ride on the back of?" The result is a breed of creatures resembling shaggy rhinos with two horns side-by-side, noted for their high aggressiveness, violent tempers and extreme stupidity. This suits the Ogres fine — repeated applications of clubs to the head are generally enough to get a Rhinox to bear a rider, and their propensity towards charing anything that moves is quite handy in the thick of battle.
    -   Also in _Warhammer 40,000_ is the Rhino APC, the Space Marines' primary transport vehicle.

    Video Games 

-   _ANNO: Mutationem_: One of the various enemies are Mooks wearing metallic rhino armor who'll pull out powerful swings or a charged rush to deliver heavy damage.
-   _Akuji the Heartless_ has _zombie_ rhinos serving as Giant Mook\-type enemies, who can sopak up plenty of hits before going down.
-   Gohma Chargers from _Asura's Wrath_, along with charging like a traditional rhino, are capable of causing small tremors by stomping it's front legs.
-   _Atelier Iris 3_ has a rhino-like Mana called Diemia, which deals physical damage to an enemy row and knocks back the targets when summoned, delaying their turns. Provided the enemies aren't resistant to physical attacks, it is arguably the strongest Mana in the entire game.
-   In _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_, rhino football players serve as enemies in Stages G and J. They charge at Chip and Dale and knock away any boxes in their path. While they are bigger than Chip and Dale, they're still very small for rhinos.
-   In the _Congo Bongo_ level Rhino Rampage, the enemies are rhinoceroses charging from all directions.
-   In the _Donkey Kong Country_ games one of your animal buddies is Rambi. He automatically tramples over enemies when running and can charge a, umm, charging attack that can break through some walls. One of the few animal buddies to be in most of the games, and the only one to make it into _Donkey Kong Country Returns_ and _Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze_.
-   _Dungeon of the Endless_ has the Hurna Rider, basically a Hurna riding a Rhinoceros-like creature. It's capable of bashing open doors, which counts as the player taking a turn and hence can spawn _even more_ waves of enemies (including more Hurna Riders) from dark rooms if it succeeds at doing so. This makes it a _very dangerous_ enemy.
-   _Dusty Revenge_ and _Dusty Raging Fist_ have rhino enemies who will attempt to inflict a Horn Attack at you repeatedly.
-   _Eastern Exorcist_ has a one-shot boss battle against Marquis Xi, a rhino-demon who alternates between smashing you to a pulp with it's mighty ax to trying to gore you with it's nasal horn.
-   _Exit Limbo: Opening_, set in a world of andromorphic animals, have _you_ playing as a rhino fighter who spends the entire game kicking all sorts of ass and ripping apart your foes.
-   Season 5 of _Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout_ introduces mechanical Rhinos in certain levels, most notably the survival round Stompin' Ground. They periodically go berserk and charge at players, flinging them far away if they don't avoid them in time.
-   Indian rhinos are one of the many animal species players can encounter in _Far Cry 4_. Ostensibly a docile herbivore, they're actually one of the most dangerous creatures in Kyrat thanks to their Hair-Trigger Temper, massive health pool, high speed and devastating charge attacks. They're also one of only two animal species (the other being the actually docile elephants) that can attack you while you're in a vehicle, resulting in a One-Hit Kill. Last but not least, rhinos almost never come alone, and if you piss off one, you'll usually have to deal with all of them at once, which isn't helped by how deceptively sneaky they can be - it's not uncommon to get flattened by a rampaging rhino out of nowhere because you moved past it without even realizing it was there.
-   _Far Cry Primal_, set in prehistoric Central Europe, features woolly rhinoceroses as one of the dangerous animals that try attacking Takkar, the player character. There's also a rare _Megacerops_ living among the rhinoceros herds (admittedly, _Megacerops_ was not a rhinoceros, but close enough). Neither of these animals can be tamed by Takkar, and Sabertooths or cave bears are the only predators that can kill them.
-   _Hearthstone_: Rhinos show up occasionally, being multi-horned wooly rhinos from _World of Warcraft_. They typically have Rush or Charge to emphasize their rampage (both let the minion attack the turn it comes into play, but Charge minions can attack the opponent directly while Rush minions can only attack other minions).
    -   Tundra Rhino is a basic Hunter minion that gives friendly Beast-type minions the Charge ability, including itself.
    -   Akali the Rhino is the Warrior's Loa in the _Rastakhan's Rumble_ set. He has Rush, and if he overkills an enemy minion, you draw another Rush minion from your deck and give it +5/+5. His spirit card, Spirit of the Rhino, makes your Rush minions immune to damage the turn they come into play.
    -   Trampling Rhino (pictured) is another Hunter minion. It has Rush, and after it attacks and kills an enemy minion, any excess damage is dealt to the enemy hero. It's a deliberate Shout-Out to _Magic: The Gathering_'s Trample mechanic.
-   There is a hero in _Heroes of Newerth_ appropriately named as Rampage who is riding a rhino.

-   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: Woolly rhinos, found in the Hebra region, are a downplayed example. They're peaceful herbivores that will flee from Link and monsters should they spot them but, if Link startles one while standing in front of it, it will charge him down and deal a fair amount of damage while doing so. The Hyrule Compendium notes that, due to their toughness and strength, only the most experienced hunters should tackle these animals.
-   The Rhino Team led by Maxim in _Library of Ruina_ is known for their durability, strength and...enormous rampages with tremendous collateral damage. They also wield huge sledgehammers and are the only one out of their 'pack' to wear powered armor that makes them significantly larger.
-   _Mega Man_
    -   Tunnel Rhino from _Mega Man X3_, whose horn and right arm are drills that help him tunnel underground. In true rhino fashion, he mainly fights by ramming the player.
    -   In _Mega Man ZX_, there's Protectos the Goreroid. Unlike your typical rhino, he doesn't try to ram you, as he is very slow and bulky. However, he more than makes up for it by attacking you with his upper horn, which is actually a _nuke missile_ that he can launch out of his body.
-   One of the more dangerous mechanical Chimera you'll encounter in _Mother 3_ is the Rhinocerocket<small>◊</small>. It's capable of charging forward and badly hurting multiple members of your party at a time, and then doing even more damage on its return trip.
-   _Ori and the Blind Forest_ has Rams, which more resemble rhinos than their real-life namesake, and can only be defeated once Ori has the Ground Pound ability to break their armor.

-   In _Pokémon_, Rhyhorn is a squat, rhino-like Pokémon described as very strong, very fond of charging and very stupid, to the point that it can only remember one thing at a time.

Notably, it and its evolution lines are the Signature Mon of Team Rocket's leader, Giovanni.

-   _The Rhino and the Redbill_ features a downplayed example with one of its portagonists, Niles. He _is_ blind, good in hand-to-hand combat and is often frowning, like most stereotypical rhinos in media, but he's also a reasonable and even-tempered fella when he has a chance to settle down. If anything, it's his friend Red that is the reckless one of the duo.

-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_:
    -   Rocksteady from _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)_ was a street punk under The Shredder's employ. He got mutated into a rhino, whereas his associate Bebop became a warthog / boar.

    -   The _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)_ introduced him as Ivan Steranko, a Russian mob boss and an old ally of the Shredder; he didn't become the mutant Rocksteady until he had failed Shredder one too many times and was mutated as punishment.

    -   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem_ has a new version of Rocksteady, this time portrayed as a black rhinoceros who got mutated into a roughly humanoid form, and is portrayed as The Brute of the gang of evil mutants led by Superfly - even moreso than the almost-as-big Bebop. By his own admission, he is angry most of the time. However, the turtles are eventually able to appeal to the other mutants' better natures and talk all of them (except Superfly himself) into pulling a Heel–Face Turn, making this the first time Rocksteady and Bebop get to be good guys. He is voiced by John Cena.

    Real Life 

-   Most rhino species aren’t particularly aggressive but the black rhino (_Diceros bicornis_) has a reputation for being high-strung and charging at people without provocation, and most rhino attacks in Africa are attributed to this species. They have also been documented to be very aggressive with each other, especially the males, with some estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all males die from combat-related injuries. It’s likely that a lot of the rhino’s bad rap can be traced back to this species. The larger and sympatric white rhino (_Ceratotherium simum_), on the other hand, is much more mild-mannered and social, and is unlikely to charge unless it’s a mother with a calf or you invade its personal boundary.
    -   It's worth noting that a large part of the rhino's reputation is due to their _terrible_ eyesight. When one literally can't tell what the approaching creature is, sometimes the best option is to trample it just in case. It's worth noting that some zoo rhinos, when acclimated to humans, are apparently quite friendly.
