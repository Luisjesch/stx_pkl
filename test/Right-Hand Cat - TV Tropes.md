_Marplet sen Tenko was sitting in a window of the Skyrrman smoking a long-stemmed pipe. His big tiger-tom, Fang, crouched beside him on the sill. As Jame crossed the square, both the innkeeper and the cat watched her with almost the same expression, calculating, self-confident, and faintly amused. Neither would relish a quick kill, she realized with sudden insight._

In an evil contrast to how much Heroes Love Dogs, Diabolical Masterminds are cat people. If they don't have a face, they will usually have a pet cat, usually some shade of white or black, sitting on their desk or in their lap, that they stroke as they describe their Evil Plan.

Why do bad guys like cats? Maybe because Cats Are Mean — they kill birds and mice, just so they can offer you the corpse. Cats are lap-sized and perfect to pet while scheming. Or maybe it's because Cats Are Superior and believe they are entitled to be worshiped and revered by humans, or deserve to Take Over the World themselves. Dogs are faithful and loyal, but cats are fickle with a superiority complex. Villains and cats just fit. It's the perfect accessory for a Card-Carrying Villain, especially the Crazy Cat Lady type.

The Big Bad's Right-Hand Cat will have varying degrees of a personality depending on the context of the series. Some will display sentient facial expressions and even an evil laugh, showing a morality in sync with their master's. Some just sit and look pretty - as stoic as ever, yawning and purring like any other ordinary pet. Even in animation, the cat will probably never speak, but it will almost always have a name.

This may stem from the tradition that All Witches Have Cats and often use cats as their familiars. Sometimes prone to the cat being a Morality Pet or biting back and run a Heel–Face Door-Slam if the Big Bad doesn't dispose it.

In more-modern settings, this kind of villain will be probably part of an Animal Wrongs Group.

See Kindhearted Cat Lover for heroic examples when a character's fondness for cats shows they're a good person, or at least not all bad.

Cardinal Richelieu was a famous cat-lover (he owned 14 cats at the time of his death) and he got a Historical Villain Upgrade since Alexandre Dumas' _The Three Musketeers_. Most adaptations picture him petting a white cat while scheming, making Richelieu the likely Trope Maker.

Pirate captains will have a Pirate Parrot instead, while Rich Bitches have spoiled lap dogs. See also Feather Boa Constrictor.

**Please note that Right-Hand Cat at its core refers to _passive_ evil pets, feline or otherwise. If the pet is also an active fighter, it belongs in Right-Hand Attack Dog, even if it is a cat.**

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the manga of _Death Note_, Teru Mikami has one.
-   In _Dragon Ball_, the Big Bad Red has one in the anime, presumably to increase his Diabolical Mastermind credentials (although his is purplish rather than white). It does not appear in the original manga, however.
-   Parodied in a _Fullmetal Alchemist_ Omake. In a picture of members of the cast as members of organized crime, Al is "Da Boss", and has an Adulr cat which is referred to as "demon henchbeast".
-   Schrödinger from _Hellsing_ is a Cat Folk version of this to the Major right down to sitting at his side and apparently angling for head scratches.
-   Djibril pets his black cat in _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny_.
-   Subverted in _Now and Then, Here and There_. King Hamdo starts out with one, but he kills it before it shows up on screen. You do see it after its death.
-   Keto from _Nurse Angel Ririka SOS_ has a black cat that spies on Ririka. Kanou later seems to own it after becoming Brainwashed and Crazy however it disappears after he is cured. Ririka herself has a dog.
-   In _Ouran High School Host Club_, Umehito Nekozawa, president of Ouran's Black Magic Club, always wears a cat puppet named Beelzenef, making it a _literal_ right-hand cat. Nekozawa is a lot nicer than his obsession with black magic and creepy subjects would lead you to initially believe, though.
-   In _Peacemaker Kurogane_, after going crazy and gay, Suzu is depicted as having a fondness for cats.
-   Giovanni with his Persian, from _Pokémon: The Series_. For a while, the Team Rocket trio's Meowth from the same series had it as his overriding goal to _become_ a Right-Hand Cat for Giovanni, though lately he seems to have decided he'd rather stay with Jessie and James. For another definition of "right hand", Giovanni also had Mewtwo, for a short time.
-   Referenced in _School-Live!_. When the girls are discussing the source of the Zombie Apocalypse, one of them theorizes a Big Bad could be behind it all. Yuki draws an Obviously Evil man with a cigar and a pet cat.
-   In _Urusei Yatsura_, the principal of Tomobiki high is sometimes seen petting a white cat while plotting against the students. He's hardly a villain (more of a Cloudcuckoolander), but the parody is obvious.
-   Toyed with in _Shaman King_, where Ren's villainous giant of a father is shown petting a fully-grown panda in his lap.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   During The Silver Age of Comic Books, Catwoman owned a pet cat named Hecate that she often employed in her schemes. Hecate even helped to spring her from prison once.
    -   Catwoman's Spear Counterpart Catman is ofen accompanied by a big cat: usually either a tiger or a pair of panthers.
-   Pizzazz has a cat in the IDW _Jem and the Holograms (IDW)_ comics. She's not really much of a "villain" but is one of the antagonists. She even has pajamas with cats on them.
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: Nazi agent Red Panzer has a pet cat which he strokes while brooding and thinking up plots.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Dick Tracy_: The cat called Kitty Square had the odd trait of smoking cigars. At different times, he belonged to two different villains: Matty Square and subsequently Mr. Bribery. Bribery attempted to break Kitty of the smoking habit, and when he that failed, he attempted to drown Kitty in the city reservoir. Bribery tied a heavy steam iron to Kitty's collar and prepared to toss it into the deep water. Kitty slipped out of the collar and attacked Bribery. For some reason, this endeared Kitty to Bribery, who took Kitty home and continued to light the cat's cigars.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Cinderella_:
    -   Lady Tremaine has a cat named _Lucifer_. He is intelligent enough to understand that Cinderella is unfairly put-upon with the chores, and mean enough to complicate them at one point.
    -   _Cinderella III: A Twist in Time_ actually has Lady Tremaine carrying Lucifer and stroking him, Blofeld-style.
-   Junkman in the _The Incredible Crash Dummies_ (a 1993 half-hour CG movie) has the Hubcat.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _And Then There Were None_: In the 1945 film adaptation, Judge Warwick, who turns out to be the evil mastermind behind the murders, holds and strokes a house cat while explaining his scheme to one of the survivors.
-   In _Army of Frankensteins_, Big Bad Captain Walton is introduced sitting his tent stroking the grey cat on his lap. He later uses the cat to test the Frankenstein serum.
-   _Austin Powers_
    -   Dr. Evil, a parody of Blofeld, with Mr. Bigglesworth. Starts as a Persian, becomes a Sphinx cat after the cryogenic revival.
    -   Mini-Me, in turn, has a Mini-Bigglesworth (a Sphinx kitten).
-   _Come and See_: The Nazi death squad commander watches the slaughter impassively from his car while a loris sits on his shoulder and nuzzles his neck. The ostentatiousness of the pet makes him even more despicable.
-   In the 1937 _Dick Tracy_ film serial, Moloch is often seen stroking a black cat.
-   _The Egyptian_ (1954) explains why this may be a trope among villains. The amoral and manipulative courtesan Nefer is holding a cat which she uses to warn the protagonist of the perils of falling for her (he doesn't listen).
    
    **Nefer:** There is a reason why the goddess of love takes the form of a cat.  
    **Sinuhe:** When I look at you I cannot think of cats or gods...  
    **Nefer:** Look, Sinuhe. A cat's paws are soft, but they hide claws. A cat takes pleasure in tormenting its victim. Not until the creature is nearly dead will it show pity... and put an end to it.
    
-   In _Enter the Dragon,_ Han, trying to recruit Roper into joining his organization, carries a fluffy white cat. To test Roper's resolve, Han sets the cat down in the business area of a guillotine and offers to let Roper pull the chain. Roper declines.
-   In _The Godfather_, the title character is seen stroking a cat in the opening scene, as a kind of Pet the Dog moment, establishing him as both a deadly gangster and a devoted and loving family man. This was not in the book or script; Marlon Brando just made friends with a cat that was wandering around the set and they decided to Throw It In. Humorously, the cat was "villainous" for the production as well—it purred so loudly during Brando's opening speech that his dialogue had to be redubbed.
-   In the infamous _Going Overboard_, Noriega has a Cute Kitten. The last you see of it is when it gets killed along with a suicidal Noriega by a grenade.
-   In the 2007 film version of _Hairspray_, Velma von Tussle gets a fluffy white Persian to stroke in one scene.
-   Auntie in the Japanese horror film _Hausu_ has Shiro, a white Persian, who the heroines discover provides Auntie with her immortality and magic abilities. It turns out Auntie lied and even killing Shiro won't stop her. Not to mention, Shiro is immortal, too.
-   _James Bond_:
    -   Ernst Stavro Blofeld, as pictured above. His ever-present fluffy white Persian is probably the Trope Codifier, being responsible for most, if not all, of the parodies and references listed on this page. This is actually due to his face being hidden from the audience in the first few movies, so there was greater focus on his pet that you'd normally have, to give the camera something to look at.
    -   A Funny Background Event shows that while the base in _You Only Live Twice_ is being attacked, the cat is dead scared and trying to escape Blofeld's grasp!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   It goes one step further in the opener to _For Your Eyes Only_ — when Bond gains control of the helicopter and comes after the Blofeld expy, his cat promptly runs off!
    -   There was a Bond comic strip for a while, where Blofeld's daughter was running SPECTRE. She also had a cat, albeit a black one (probably drawing on another trope).
    -   _Diamonds Are Forever_ plays with this a little, when Bond confronts Blofeld and his Body Double. Unsure of which is which, Bond kicks the white Persian in the room and shoots the one it jumps to for safety. Sadly, it doesn't work, as there's more than one cat too.
        
        **Blofeld:** Right idea, Mr. Bond...  
        **Bond:** But wrong pussy.
        
    -   Sanchez in _Licence to Kill_ has a Right Hand...._iguana_. Same general idea only reptilian.
    -   In _Spectre_, Franz Oberhauser has a white cat hanging around his torture chamber. It's an early hint that he's actually this continuity's Blofeld.
-   In the kung fu film _Kid From Kwangtung_, the main villain owns a black cat, which he strokes in numerous scenes while watching his minions kill off Redshirts, in a rather obvious nod to Blofeld. When the villain get into fights though, the black cat somehow remains in his hands without being scared off.
-   In _Lady on a Train_, the sinister Mr. Saunders, who is one of the conspirators in Josiah Waring's murder, carries a white cat around with him. At one point, while sneaking around the nightclub, Nikki hears meowing from behind her and knows she's been discovered.
-   _Night of the Demon_: Satanic cult leader Karswell has a pet gray cat called Graymalkin.
-   In Erich von Stroheim's 1929 silent film _Queen Kelly_, the wicked and beautiful Queen Regina owns a white Persian cat that she often strokes, sometimes when nude.
-   In the Japanese Ninja movie _Shinobi no Mono_, Oda Nobunaga is shown petting cats in several scenes. Notably, Roald Dahl saw the film while writing the script for _You Only Live Twice_, so while the (unseen) Blofield stroked a pet cat in earlier Bond movies, this film might have been an inspiration for his iconic representation doing it in _You Only Live Twice_.
-   In _Theatre of Death_ (also known as _Blood Fiend_), the cruel and demanding director Philippe Darvas (played by Christopher Lee) only shows affection towards his pet Siamese cat Seraphina.
-   _The Three Musketeers_:
    -   _The Three Musketeers_ (1921), Richelieu, the Evil Chancellor plotting to destroy both the Queen and the Musketeers, has a cat that he holds and pets.
    -   Vincent Price does the same when playing Richelieu in the 1948 _The Three Musketeers_.
-   _Twisted Pair_, the villainous Koos carries around a small bowl of diamonds that he strokes as if it were an example of this trope.
-   _Youth of the Beast_: Nomoto, the boss of a brutal Yakuza gang, has a cat he's always carrying around and snuggling with. In his first scene he throws a knife at Jo with one arm while holding the cat with another.

    Literature 

-   Etienne Galant, the Big Bad in _The Corpse in the Waxworks_ by John Dickson Carr, is seen stroking a white Persian. The book was published in 1932.
-   In _Changes_, Harry Dresden's fairy godmother the Leanansidhe, who takes pleasure at someone upgrading her from "Spooky death Sidhe lady" to "Spooky, _crazy_ death Sidhe lady," is waiting for Harry in his home with his cat Mister on her lap. She also swivels his chair around, despite it not meant to have that function.
-   One of the earliest examples of this trope would be Victorian Era supervillain Dr. Nikola, who was always accompanied by a huge, black cat named Appolyon, which would sit on his shoulder instead of the later lap version of this trope.
-   In Raymond Chandler's short story "Finger Man", the corrupt politico (and Big Bad of the story) Frank Dorr has a large, black Persian cat on his desk, which he pets and plays with throughout his conversation with the Hardboiled Detective protagonist. The cat actually plays a role in the plot besides just characterizing the villain: when negotiations go south, the detective grabs the cat and throws it at Frank Dorr, then grabs Frank's gun during the resulting confusion.
-   In Flannery O'Connor's short story "A Good Man is Hard to Find" an escaped convict called the Misfit murders an entire family, who is stranded by an isolated road after an accident, and afterwards picks up and strokes their pet cat (that had caused the accident).
-   Tuttan-Rha's undead pet cat, Cleopatra, from the _Goosebumps HorrorLand_ novel _Who's Your Mummy?_ The main character, Abby, unintentionally causing her to disintegrate by spraying her with water is how she discovers Rha's weakness.
-   She doesn't hold her cats in her hand, but Dolores Umbridge from _Harry Potter_, probably the second most sadistic person in the series behind Voldemort himself, is seemingly addicted to cats. Her office is lined with plates and pictures depicting cats. As well, her Patronus was in the shape of a Persian cat, and it paced in front of her during the courtroom scene in _Deathly Hallows_ to protect her from the dementors; Word of God states that "she \[likes\] anything decorated with kittens (though found the real thing inconveniently messy)." Averted in the case of Professor McGonagall, a good character in the same series, who also has a cat Patronus and can transform into a cat (an ordinary tabby rather than something fluffy and expensive). In between the two is Argus Filch, the Jerkass caretaker at Hogwarts, with his unpleasantly scrawny and dust-colored Mrs. Norris. His genuine love and affection for her (to the point of being driven to tears when she was nearly killed) is one of his few redeeming traits. Hermione Granger herself also has a pet cat, the very intelligent Crookshanks.
-   In Yulia Latynina's _Inhuman_, when Mehmed Lee "Eat-Alive" Trastamara (an incredibly old, infamous man, the right-hand of the Evil Overlord that founded the empire, the inventor of many nasty viruses, as well as a brainwashing symbiont, and the great-grandfather of the Villain Protagonist who comes to him for advice) finally appears in the flesh, he is sitting in a chair with a big white and red cat resting in his lap. Despite being both ancient and retired, "Eat-Alive" still has a hand in almost everything that happens in the Human Empire and more, to the extent of eventually organising a successful coup d'etat and establishing himself as the most adroit and savvy opponent of the alien conspiracy. Let's just say, he _earned_ that cat.
-   Subverted in Reginald Hill's _Joe Sixsmith_ series, where loving cats is a sign of virtue. Sixsmith has a much-beloved pet cat who goes everywhere with him and enjoys a good snack of beer and crisps at the pub; he later discovers that one of the friendlier police inspectors has multiple Persians.
-   _Nick Velvet_: In "The Theft of the Mafia Cat", Nick is hired to steal the right-hand cat of a Mafia don.
-   In the _Emberverse_, The Chessmaster Sandra Arminger pets her Persians as an aid to concentrating on her schemes.
-   In 1956, even before Blofeld made it cool, back in the original book of _The Hundred and One Dalmatians_, Cruella de Vil had a white Persian cat, as opposed to the heroic dog-loving Dearlys. When they actually met the cat, Pongo and Missis found she was actually nice (we had already learned of Cruella's drowning of her kittens — as if that woman needed extra Kick the Dog credentials). She then joined the dogs in wrecking Cruella's private fur collection.
-   In an early version of _Tolkien's Legendarium_, Morgoth, the first dark lord, had a right hand cat name Tevildo the lord of cats. He was massive in size and commanded other giant cats. While he would be cut from the "final" version of the stories, Tevildo is notable for being considered the original version of Sauron.
-   Discussed in _The Unadulterated Cat_. The Right Hand Cat is not a Real Cat, because there are no unwanted animal bits hiding underneath the laser table.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Conan_: Conan O'Brien's impression of an NBC executive involves talking in an "evil" voice and miming petting a cat in his arms.
-   _Curb Your Enthusiasm_: Larry David and his business manager/friend Jeff Greene reference this trope and the Trope Codifier himself at the tail end of a conversation where they're scheming to get someone to play in their golf tournament. Jeff just happens to be stroking a white, very fluffy throw cushion:
    
    **Larry:** Hey, nice pillow. Yeah, um— you look like Blofeld.  
    **Jeff:** _\[busts out laughing\]_ I look like I've got a kitty and we're making evil plans!
    
-   In an episode of _Cutthroat Kitchen_ a chef's lobster is taken away and replaced by fish sticks, smoked mussels, and blackened tilapia for a sushi roll challenge. Alton pretends to pet the lobster like he's a Bond villain and says "Excellent."
    -   In a Halloween episode he dresses up like a parody of Blofeld, complete with a stuffed cat that he can pet in evil mastermind fashion.
-   Played for Laughs in the _Glee_ episode "Dynamic Duets" with Hunter Corrington, the Warblers' new captain, who is presented petting a white cat.
-   Mick of _Kamen Rider Double_ is the pet cat of The Don/Big Bad Ryubee Sonozaki. He also doubles as one of the high ranking goons: the Smilodon Dopant.
-   While she wasn't a villain _per se_, Mrs. Pynchon, the (cold and typically unlikable) newspaper publisher (and everyone's boss) in the TV series _Lou Grant_, has a cat who resides on her desk at her office.
-   Hal from _Malcolm in the Middle_ references this trope when he is pondering what he can do since he has the loyalty of a dozen dim-witted bodybuilders.
    
    **Hal:** Lois, please stop me if you see me laughing in front of an earth globe while stroking a white cat.
    
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ episode "Secret Agent Super Dragon" had Dr. Forrester explaining the film's Big Bad was uninteresting because he lacked a pet.
-   Referenced in the finale of _The Shadow Line_:
    
    **Gatehouse:** People don't do bad things just because they want to stroke a white cat.
    
-   _Star Trek: The Original Series_ used this a few times.
    -   "Catspaw": Korob has a pet black cat. Since he's dressed (and acts) like a wizard, Spock assumes that the cat is his familiar. Later on, the cat changes into the form of a beautiful woman, and it turns out that she's really the episode's Big Bad.
    -   "Assignment Earth": Gary Seven has a black cat named Isis that appears to be intelligent. At the end of the episode, it's revealed that Isis is actually a beautiful humanoid female who can take cat form (or vice-versa).
-   _Titans (2018)_: Lampshaded in Season 3 when Jason Todd becomes a Big Bad Wannabe. When he wires Hank to a bomb and demands a ransom in gold bars hijacked from a Gotham bank, instead of the money being wired to a Swiss Bank Account, Hank sarcastically wonders if he's stroking a white cat as well.
-   Another non-villainous example: Cee Lo Green strokes a white cat in this fashion during Season 2 of _The Voice_.
-   Non-villainous example: King Ezekiel from season 7 of _The Walking Dead (2010)_ has a right-hand _tiger_ named Shiva. He used to be the zookeeper who cleaned out the tiger cage, and he saved Shiva's life during the zombie apocalypse.
-   The _Will & Grace_ episode "Bully Wooley" has Karen Walker confronting Scott Wooley/Jeff Goldblum (right after he drank cat pee thinking it was champagne) in the climax while stroking a white Persian.
-   _Malcolm in the Middle_ mentions this trope in an episode where Hal befriends a group of very strong, but not too bright bodybuilders who admire him for his smarts and would gladly do anything he asks. He starts to wonder what to do with all this "power" and asks Lois to stop him if he ever starts laughing while looking at a world globe and stroking a cat.

    Puppet Shows 

-   In the extended version of _The Muppets_' Villain Song "Let's Talk About Me", Corrupt Corporate Executive Tex Richman gets a little sidetracked from boasting about how great it is to be him when he mentions gold-plating his _gold,_ which leads him to:
    
    _I even got a guy to gold-plate my cat  
    I don't regret much, but I do regret that  
    If I could start all over, I'd do it all the same  
    Except I wouldn't gold-plate little Twinkles again!_

-   _Warhammer_'s Vampire Queen Neferata has a ghostly cat familiar called Bastet, and her vampiric descendents - the Lahmian Sisterhood - also tend to go in for cats in a big way.
-   Intentionally invoked on this forum as a suggestion for a good use for a template that creates an undead made from a taxidermied skin that can pass for a living creature to all but the most keen-eyed of observers... until they look into its eyes and see the inside of its scalp, or it deflates and slithers away.

    Theatre

-   In _Final Fantasy XIV_, Quickthinx Allthoughts, the leader of the Goblin Illuminati responsible for summoning Alexander, is almost always accompanied by his black courel kitten, Shanoa. Even when he's battling the Warriors of Light, he allows Shanoa to roam around the battlefield for morale support. In fact, one of the most important mechanics of the battle is preventing said morale boost from reaching Quickthinx (via destroying the floating heart which personifies it).

Notably, it's one of the few times you can hear Kel'Thuzad being genuinely angry.
        
        **Kel'thuzad:** NO! A curse upon you, interlopers! The armies of the Lich King will hunt you down! You will NOT escape your fate!

    Visual Novels 

-   The Big Bad of the Japan-only sequel to _Ace Attorney Investigations_ has an unusual one. First a pig appears, then a squirrel jumps on the pig, and finally a cat jumps on the squirrel. The villain then leans on the cat in a Slouch of Villainy, also doubling as a nod to _The Bremen Town Musicians_, a story well-known in Japan. (This is because the villain is an animal tamer.)

    Webcomics 

-   In _The Brick Testament_, the evil pharaoh of Egypt in _Exodus_ is portrayed with a pet cat (see page 2).
-   _But I'm a Cat Person_'s Ann Walker has a tiger. Well, a shapeshifting Being that she usually keeps in tiger form. (In contrast, the house cat Being is owned by a protagonist, and, back when she was owned by a crazy cult leader, was almost always kept in human form.)
-   _Dr. Nonami_. Dr. Mechano has Destroyer, an adorable little kitty who he insists is a vicious killing machine.

-   In _Overlord of Ravenfell_, Razin maintains cuddling kitties is perfectly acceptable for an Overlord. Since cats are evil, so are the cuddles.
-   According to _Sev Trek_ this is the reason Blofeld's mooks aren't allowed to see his face.
    
    "It's not a pleasant sight. I'm allergic to cats."

    Websites 

-   This website sells them.

    Western Animation 

-   Catwoman didn't start with one, but _Batman: The Animated Series_ provided her with Isis, proving this trope fits on her pretty well.
-   _Bob's Burgers_: Discussed in "Burger Wars", where Louise describes their landlord Mr Fischoder as "One white cat away from being a super-villain."
-   Mildly parodied in _Danny Phantom_, to the point of Running Gag status. In several episodes of the first two seasons, Danny encourages his arch enemy, Vlad, to get a cat, to which he usually gives an emphatic "No!", but lo and behold, the second episode of the third season had him sitting in his study, petting — what else — a white cat, named after Danny's mother, Maddie.
-   The title character in _Dan Vs._ adopted a cat named Mr. Mumbles and sometimes brings her along with him to participate in his attempts to get revenge on whoever he feels has wronged him.
-   Roger, the bully from _Doug_, has a Right-Hand Cat called Stinky, whereas Doug has a reliable, intelligent dog called Porkchop. One episode gives him A Day in the Limelight when Roger makes Doug look after him while Roger's away. He trashes the house, and eats pizza and ice cream, and is generally nasty. Then, he gets sick and Doug freaks out, thinking that this is because he let the cat get its own way, and worries about what Roger will do... turns out, he was neither sick nor a "he". She was pregnant.
-   _DuckTales_: In the James Bond parody episode "Double-O-Duck", Dr. Nogood has a Right-Hand Persian cat.

-   Skeletor with Panthor, from _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)_. Though this was somewhat reversed in that it was the cat who carried Skeletor, rather than the other way around. Also downplayed in that the hero also has a cat companion.
-   _Inspector Gadget_: Dr. Claw has Mad Cat, his constantly laughing cat that endures all the abuse that happens when his master suddenly pounds the table, rubs his fur a little too hard, or simply smack because he's in the way or did something Claw doesn't like.
    
    **Claw:** Why are you laughing? I'm the one who did all the work!

-   Ahuizotl in _Daring Do_, from the episodes "Read It and Weep" and "Daring Don't" of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, has a white kitten. It's worth pointing out that this cat is every bit as aggressive and dangerous as the panthers and tigers it appears alongside with, though.

## Subversions and Playing with the trope

    Anime & Manga 

-   Tailmon (Gatomon in the dub) of _Digimon Adventure_ started off as Vamdemon's (a.k.a. Myotismon) Right-Hand Cat (though, being a Digimon, she could talk and fight), but it later turned out that she was the missing partner of the eighth Chosen Child.
-   What the fat cat in _FLCL_ actually was is unclear, but Haruko spends a remarkable amount of time and attention on it. Apparently, she was using it to communicate with her boss. For those unfamiliar with _FLCL_, don't even try to work out how said communication is supposed to in any way work.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_:
    -   Russia has a cat — the only animal that doesn't flee from him — but oddly enough, he is never depicted stroking it (though he does pet him with apparently genuine affection), and whether he's actually _evil_ is up for debate.
    -   Not to mention, he's not the only cat-owning nation-tan. Japan is seen feeding his own cat Tama/Japaneko, and it's implied that most if not all the other Nekotalia cats belong to their corresponding nations.
-   In _Medabots_, the Right-Hand Cat contains the soul of the Big Bad; the human body is just a robotic shell.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: According to early production notes, Kaworu Nagisa was originally supposed to have a cat. It only serves to make the manga's infamous scene of him snapping a kitten's neck to spare it from starvation (because Shinji wouldn't adopt it, that jerk) even Harsher in Hindsight.
-   The anime _Now and Then, Here and There_ has the resident psychotic leader pet a cat in the first episode he appears in. And then break its neck when getting his first but not last on-screen psychotic episode.
-   Played with in _The Prince of Tennis_, where the main character is an antisocial and skittish kid who is very attached to his pet cat, Karupin. He may not pet him à la Blofeld, but likes to have the feline sleeping in his bed.
-   Double Subversion in _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_: the fact that Daitokouji-sensei had a pet cat could have been a clue he was The Mole, until he was further revealed to be a Double Agent. And after his Redemption Equals Death, the cat _takes over his job_.

    Comic Books 

-   _Bomb Queen_'s eponymous supervillainess/Evil Overlord has a black cat named Ashe who, in the most recent volume, has been revealed as an ancient demon who's been using Bomb Queen and her city.
-   _Green Lantern_: Atrocitus, leader of the Red Lantern Corps has an interesting use of the trope in his fellow Red Lantern Dex-Starr, who is a cat from Earth who earned a Red Lantern Ring thanks to his backstory, so he's pretty inteligent for a normal housecat, and as such, is not a pet, but an equal member of the corps. Despite this, Atrocitus seems pretty fond of him and is not uncommon to find him petting the cat and calling him a good kitty. Also adding to the subversion, is that the Red Lanterns aren't really bad guys as much as really, REALLY violent anti-heroes.
-   _Transmetropolitan_:
    -   Gary "The Smiler" Callahan at one point notes that he wants a cat so he can keep and stroke it like a bond villain. This happens at the opening of a Motive Rant where he's revealed to be a misanthropic monster who wants to fuck over America for his own entertainment, making its connection to this trope even stronger.
    -   Spider, meanwhile, has a cat... A three-eyed, two-mouthed, chain-smoking mutant cat who loves urinating at Spider when he's having a bad day. Spider does, at one point, treat her as a right-hand cat during "Spider's Trash", but otherwise she serves more as a walking Pet the Dog moment for the otherwise Jerkass Spider.

    Fan Works 

-   Trope Codifier Ernst Stavro Blofeld still has his cat in the Denser and Wackier Character Blog _Ask Ernst Stavro Blofeld_, where it receives its name, Volcano. Blofeld occasionally discusses how much he loves ominously stroking the thing.
-   _Plan 7 of 9 from Outer Space_. The heroes have been captured by the Big Bad, whom they assume is a Cat Folk alien when a Persian cat appears on the viewscreen. The Big Bad then tells his bungling henchman that the camera is too low, and to point it at his face instead.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Bolt_: Dr. Calico, the villain of the Show Within a Show, has two cats. The feline actors who play them love to torment Bolt (who thinks the show is real) by going to his trailer and making threats in character. After Bolt is lost, he mistakes stray alley cat Mittens for one of the Right-Hand Cats and tries to get her to take him back.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _The Cannonball Run_ 2, Mob boss Don Canneloni is seen stroking a cat. Then he looks down... and says (quietly and with no special tone), "This cat is dead. Bring me another cat." The mooks do.
-   Inverted in _Cats & Dogs_ where the villains of the film are cats who just happen to be led by a white Persian. The leader Persian Cat invokes this trope to interact with humans, using a comatose man in a wheelchair. The human's mouth has a bandana or something around it, so the cat makes others think the human is talking, so as not to freak everybody out with a talking cat.
-   In _Disenchanted_ Giselle's wish for a "fairy tale life" has the side effect of turning her from a Princess Classic and Good Stepmother into a Wicked Stepmother so it also turns her cute animal sidekick, Pip the chipmunk, into an evil cat much like Lucifer from _Cinderella_.
-   In _Licence to Kill_, James Bond is stopped by armed men and led to a man who is stroking a cat. Turns out M was getting bored waiting for him and a cat happened to wander in. They were at Hemingway House in Key West, Florida, which is famous for its population of polydactyl cats.
-   Inverted in _The Spirit_. The Octopus sacrifices a white Persian cat just to demonstrate to his Arch-Enemy, the Spirit, the drawbacks of his potion. As the Spirit points out, that's reason enough to kill him.
-   In the comedy _They Call Me Bruce?_, the Boss of Bosses rings up the West Coast mafia to express his disapproval about the FBI busting their drug operations. While he's talking the Boss is stroking a white Persian cat, and suddenly plunges his hand into a fish tank and takes out a goldfish...which he then eats himself.

    Literature 

-   In the book _1633_ (in which an American town is transported to 17th-c. Europe), the people of Grantville send Cardinal Richelieu a Siamese cat as a "diplomatic offering". He takes it and strokes it in exactly the way described here. (Persians evidently were introduced in Europe in 1620 according to T.O.W., so one of them wouldn't have been quite as impressive a gift, though a modern Persian's appearance is evidently very different-looking to those times'.)
-   _Discworld_:
    -   Parodied in the series, when Lord Vetinari, a Magnificent Bastard dictator who began as a sort of Blofeld spoof, had an old terrier called Wuffles, even though other characters and the narrator had him pegged as the "white-cat-stroking type".
    -   In the Time Travel Prequel _Night Watch_, the young Vetinari's aunt has a Right-Hand Cat, but it's a borderline-feral and rather flatulent moggy, which Vetinari feels isn't really appropriate. He even thinks it should be a long-haired white cat.
    -   Evil Harry Dread, a wannabe-dark lord from _The Last Hero_, had _intended_ to play this trope straight, but found out he's allergic to cats. The closest he could come was a fluffy white hamster in a diamante treadmill.
-   Gregor Brastov in Kim Newman's alternate-history vampire novel _Dracula Cha-Cha-Cha_ (a.k.a. _Judgment of Tears_) is a Blofeldish cat-stroking archvillain who turns out to be just a puppet manipulated by the real archvillain — his cat. Hamish Bond should have remembered that some vampires have Voluntary Shapeshifting.
-   Inverted in _The Dresden Files_. The protagonist Harry Dresden lives with a gigantic grey cat named "Mister," whom he (Harry) rescued from a dumpster as a kitten.
-   A rare heroic example: Honor Harrington and her treecat Nimitz. Though he's usually perched on her shoulders, which are covered with reinforced pads.
-   Completely averted in Tamora Pierce's fantasy novel _Wolf-Speaker_ (book 2 of _The Immortals_). The villain HATES cats.
-   Billingford in _The Jennifer Morgue_ by Charles Stross has a classic Right-Hand Cat as part of his Bond-based destiny trap, which eventually turns out to be posessed by the Eldritch Abomination he's working for.
-   Subverted in _The King in Yellow_. Evil psychopath Mr. Wilde has a cat. At the end, it tears out his throat, thus foiling Hildred Castaigne's evil scheme. To express his annoyance, Hildred kills the cat. So the Right-Hand Cat made the Heroic Sacrifice to save the day.
-   In _The Malloreon_ saga by David Eddings, Kal Zakath has a cat that serves more as an opportunity for quiet humor than a villainous icon; the (seemingly) ruthless and cold-hearted emperor of all Mallorea frequently attempts to pawn off newborn kittens to heads of state, the main characters, and whoever else seems likely to claim a cat. Of course, the frequent Pet the "Dog" moments only foreshadowed Kal Zakath's eventual Heel–Face Turn from not-quite-villain antagonist to ally of Belgarion. Even if he did make one of his primary reasons for turning face. "You know, Garion, I've just realized that you're _functionally omnipotent_. So how's about I just give up and make peace before you eventually kill me?"
-   In _Moon Over Soho_, Peter imagines the faceless man with a Right-Hand Cat Girl sitting on his lap and chatting on the phone.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Subverted in _La Femme Nikita_ when a villain is shown holding a white Right-Hand Cat, before demonstrating nerve gas on him for buyers.
-   Subverted in _Game of Thrones_ as Tommen Baratheon — who loves cats and has a cat as pet named Sir Pounce — becomes King. Whether he would be as cruel as most other kings in the setting, we won't know as he kills himself in season six. Also averted with his older brother, predecessor and probably one of the cruelest characters on the series: Joffrey, as he actually hated cats and found pleasure torturing them.
-   Parodied in _Happy Endings_, when Jane (once again cast in a loveable villain mode) is shown sitting ominously in a chair while petting the neighbours' white cat. She goes from standing in front of Brad and Dave, no cat in sight, to sitting behind them in a chair, stroking the pet-all without them noticing. Brad questions where she got the cat, and she says she told him earlier they were watching a friend's cat-tied into the episode's theme of Gaslighting.
-   House, in one episode of season 4, deals with Death Cat. To confuse his team, he puts it on his lap, plays with a cigar, and says, "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die." More than one Bond fan has noted that this was said by Goldfinger, not Blofeld, though he gets Blofeld's mannerisms pretty well.
-   In the _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ episode featuring _Secret Agent Super Dragon_, Dr. Forrester notes the chief reason the Big Bad of the Bond-like film was forgettable was that he had no cat or pet of any kind.
-   _Police Squad!_:
    -   The TV comedy has fun with this one in a few episodes, including one scene where a man is stroking a white cat until someone enters his office, at which point he casually puts the cat away in a desk drawer. He has a puppy in another desk drawer, not to mention a flock of doves in his filing cabinet.
    -   The Boss is first shown via a Blofeld-style lap-cam pointing at his cat, until he gets tired of this and leans down to speak directly into the camera.
-   _Scrubs_:
    -   After having sworn revenge against Dr. Cox and then overheard something that would aid him in said revenge, the Janitor turns around in a swivel chair, stroking the nonexistent Leonard.
        
        **Janitor:** So, you don't want to know the ending of something. I can relate to that.  
        **Dr. Cox:** What is that in your lap?  
        **Janitor:** Leonard. Half-kitten, half-monkey.
        
    -   Dr. Cox also makes use of this trope when confronting a pediatric physician in his office full of toys (sorry, collectibles), by stroking a plush white Persian cat.
-   In the _SCTV_ parody of The Godfather, Guy Cabellero attempts to do this ala Marlon Brando. The cat, however, is less than cooperative.
-   The _Dirty Harry_ parody _Sledge Hammer!_ has one episode where a crime boss is always seen with a cat and ends up throwing the cat out of the window when he is upset. It is not surprising when Sledge kicks him out the window at the end of the episode (and even more ironically, the cat lands safely on the crime boss' chair).
-   _Star Trek: The Original Series_:
    -   In the episode "Catspaw", the villain Korob has a black cat, who turns to be another shapeshifter, Sylvia, who later turns into a _giant_ black cat.
    -   Gary Seven with Isis in the episode "Assignment Earth" is initially thought to be a villain, but this is Subverted at the episode's end when Gary Seven is revealed to be trying to save the human race from a nuclear war, and Isis is revealed to be a shapeshifter.
-   The "Spy Car" episode of _Ultimate Car Buildoff_ gives us co-host Lou Santiago playing the part of a foreign spymaster with, get this, a bobcat.

    Theatre 

-   In a version of _The Pink Wasp and Yellow Jacket_, the villain has a cat that he would periodically forget he was holding and accidentally throw into the air. At one point, Yellow Jacket, played as a Asian stereotype, picks up the cat and tries to eat it.
-   Creepily subverted in the play _Woyzeck_ (as well as the opera and rock opera based thereon). Although the Doctor has a pet cat, he throws it out the window just to see whether it lands on its feet.

    Video Games 

-   _Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts_ has Piddles, a cat given to Gruntilda by the Lord of Games... who she boots 12 feet in the air after meeting. Needless to say, Piddles hates her mistress with a passion and gleefully takes the opportunity to be a Bad Boss to her in the epilogue.
-   In _Dangeresque 3_, the Cheat is used as one of these.
-   Video game inversion: General Viggo from _Fur Fighters_ is an anthro cat who pets a mini-human.
-   In _Ghost Trick_, Sissel was this to Yomiel for ten long years, as well as being his only friend since the Temsik incident. Although Yomiel isn't really evil, just driven crazy from solitude.
-   Similar to his comic appearance, Atrocitus in _Injustice 2_ is assisted in battle by his fellow Red Lantern Dex-Starr, with his special mechanic used to temporaly summon and command various attacks. But, like the above mention, Dex-Starr is not a pet, but another member of the Red Lantern corps, and as such, smarter than the average cat from Earth.
-   An inverted example, since those involved are good guys: Telma the barmaid, in _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_, has one of these in Louise. Unbeknownst to her human, Louise considers herself an active part of the Resistance movement that Telma herself helps to run, and even assists Link when he's in wolf form.
-   Parodied in _LEGO City Undercover_, where Ellie finds it hard to believe that Villain with Good Publicity Forrest Blackwell is evil until she realizes that his last TV appearance had him stroking a cat the entire time.
-   In _Luigi's Mansion 3_, Polterkitty initially fills the typical role of "the villain's pet cat" for Hellen Gravely, but she eventually decides to go out and actively cause trouble for Luigi herself by stealing elevator buttons from him several times. She'll also turn into a panther-like monster when cornered.
-   With her talents at summoning chimerae and piloting a _Humongous Mecha_, Perrault of _Lunar Knights_ is not only the Right-Hand Cat of The Dragon, but also his Battle Butler.
-   Averted in _Street Fighter_. Cammy is shown to have a great love of cats, but she's an ex-Tyke Bomb Action Girl who is firmly in the side of good after her Brainwashed and Crazy stint is over.
-   _The Talos Principle_: Only seen on the cover art, unless you find the right easter egg.

    Visual Novels 

-   Nikolai Stirling in _Queen of Thieves_, the criminal mastermind known as the "Thief Lord," has a pet Russian Blue cat named Elizabeth. Early in his first season, the heroine accurately deduces that he likes Elizabeth because she's capable of surprising him, and because she's elegant and aloof like he is.
-   Played with in _Umineko: When They Cry_: Bernkastel (a Cat Girl to boot) has a seemingly infinite number of cat minions that she can use. But it's later revealed that she is herself the pet cat of Featherine. A very snarky cat.

    Webcomics 

-   Parodied in _El Goonish Shive_ when Ellen holds Brownie and laughs maniacally while stroking her. The title of the strip notes that cats make good props referring to their use in this trope.
-   In _The Order of the Stick_, Lord Shojo pretends to consult his cat, "Mr. Scruffy", as part of his pretense of senility. An inversion in any case, since Shojo is a good guy. Of course, Mr. Scruffy now appears to have become a genuine Right-Hand Cat to the Heroic Comedic Sociopath Belkar.
-   In _Scandinavia and the World_, any of the characters (notably, Russia) can appear stroking a white cat while in "evil mastermind" mode.
-   _Sunstone_: While cat-sitting the troublesome Mr. Bonkers, Ally tries to get some use out of her and invoke this image to enhance her powerful and seductive presence for her date. Of course Mr. Bonkers reacts to this by almost instantly bounding off in search of something interesting, ruining the effect.

    Websites 

-   In the _SCP Foundation_ story "The High Court with the Magic Army", a new member of the O5 Council remarks to a colleague, "It's like you want to live up to your reputation of Omniscient Council of Possible Supervillains. I'm surprised we don't get cats to pet and mustaches to twirl." The other O5 replies that she used to have a pet cat, but she gave it up when she joined the Council, presumably either because she would be too busy to care for it or because having a pet was seen as a security risk.

    Web Videos 

-   Goldentusk's video for the James Bond Theme Song parodies plenty _James Bond_ tropes, including the Right-Hand Cat.
-   In the _Joueur du Grenier_ videos, the CEO of Mauvais Jeux Inc. (a Card-Carrying Villain) is often seen stroking a (plush) white cat.
-   Referenced in _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_; Ishizu tries to tell Marik that he's not really evil, because evil people do things like stroke cats while sitting in revolving chairs. Shortly thereafter, Marik tells his henchman to drive to Wal-Mart so he can purchase a revolving chair and a kitten.

    Western Animation 

-   Subverted in the _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_ Five-Episode Pilot, wherein Fat Cat debuts as Chlordane's Right-Hand Cat, only to become a villain in his own right for the rest of the series (while Chlordane is never heard from again). Even during the pilot, after helping Chlordane steal a ruby, Fat Cat steals the ruby from Chlordane for his own purposes, making sure to return it before its absence is noticed.

-   _Josie and the Pussycats_ has Sebastian the cat as the Team Pet. Sebastian is usually handled by Alexandra Cabot, the Token Evil Teammate. His fur is a black-and-white mix. Sebastian isn't really evil, just snickering and subversive, much like Alexandra.
-   Subverted in _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_. The girls once defeated an archetypal faceless villain who stole a valuable jewel to power a laser, and took his pet cat home afterwards. The _cat_ was actually the villain all along and hypnotized The Professor into almost finishing the mass brainwashing project.

Finally, he just asks her to be more cautious, but when the police turn up to arrest him, cue Beware the Superman.

-   _The Thrawn Trilogy_: The comic book version often depicts Grand Admiral Thrawn cradling and stroking a ysalamiri, a nearly vegetative lizard creature, like it's a cat, when in the books he carries one in a nutrient frame strapped to his back or connected to his command chair. Ysalamiri negate the powers of his psychotic Dark Jedi ally, and occasionally he reaches up and strokes it to remind C'baoth that he can't be choked, electrocuted, or charmed, but he doesn't carry one around in his arms or on his lap. You can't really do that with ysalamiri. Plus, they smell. Still, the depiction is universal enough that it's practically an extension of his Iconic Outfit.
-   _Watchmen_: Adrian Veidt has Bubastis, some kind of bright-red mutant lynx-thing. Until he disintegrated it.

-   In the _Red Steel_ setting for _Dungeons & Dragons_ 2<sup>nd</sup> ed., there were several humanoid animal PC races. So the monster book had a tamable primate that looked like a little human (or dwarf, elf, etc., dependent on breed), to enable the evil cat person to have a Right-Hand Human.
-   In a surprisingly not-over-the-top example from _Warhammer 40,000_, select special characters have pets that accompany them onto the battlefield. Inquisitor Torquemada and Space Wolves' Njal Stormcalle both have android eagles. The Chaos Lord Huron Blackheart has his Hamadrya, a demonic Familiar, and some Chaos Sorcerors also take them as well. These are actually reasonably logical in the setting.

    Video Games 

-   _Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2_. Romanov is shown stroking a baby turtle which he calls Sam, in mockery of Uncle Sam and the US "Duck and Cover" policy.
-   K. Rool has a Right-Hand Klaptrap (a small bitey crocodile) for the cutscenes of _Donkey Kong 64_, in a manner _very_ reminiscent of Dr. Claw, no less.
-   _DUSK-12_ has the Mad Scientist responsible for your predicament and mutation owning a pet cat. In the opening FMV it appears the cat is just a stray animal in the bio-lab, but after completing the game, reaching the final stage, the same cat appears in the hands of said scientist with him petting it while monologuing.
-   President Evil Rufus Shinra in _Final Fantasy VII_ had (very briefly) a panther named Dark Nation. Very briefly because it only shows up in the battle where you first meet Rufus, where Cloud promptly kills it.
-   In _Gunman Chronicles_ The General's first introduction post Face–Heel Turn features him stroking a xenome larva in a fairly blatant homage to this trope. Subverted in that he throws it on the ground and squashes it with his foot, moments later, to emphasize a point.
-   Rugal Bernstein and his pet panther Rodem in _The King of Fighters_. His kids, Adelheid and Rose, have a little black kitten who is apparently the offspring of Rodem. Also included is Zero with Glaugan (a black lion) from _2001_.
-   To an extent, Chen of _Touhou Project_. A cat youkai at the service of Yukari Yakumo.

    Web Animation 

-   _Homestar Runner:_ from the _Dangeresque_ films, Baron Darin Diamonocle (played by Bubs) is a parody of the Blofeld-style supervillain. He uses The Cheat as his cat-substitute.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Niels_, Niels has spent way too much time at home due to a work-related "accident", so when Agent 300 comes to check up on him, he prepares to have a little fun. Of course, Niels doesn't have any pets, so he uses Kiddo instead.
    
    **Kiddo:** Woof!  
    **Agent 300:** He's supposed to be a _dog_?  
    **Niels:** Mayyyyyybe...  
    **Kiddo:** Oink oink!
    
-   _Oglaf_: In the strip Doctor Hexagon, a queen bee is stroking a smaller, white-furred insect while exposing her evil plan to the beekeeper.
-   In _Umlaut House 2_, ASCII is briefly seen with a robotic cat (he's an android) during his supervillain phase.

    Web Videos 

-   _TFS at the Table_: Lott Fineday of the Grand Design Pirates is a tabaxi, a species of cat-like humanoids. When he calls the heroes to meet him, he is sat in a high-backed chair stroking a puppy.

    Western Animation 

-   _All Hail King Julien_ has the evil fanaloka Karl and his pet hissing cockroach Chauncey. It can even purr when he pets it.
-   In _Beast Wars_, Megatron's Right-Hand Cat is his... actual hand. In two of the three forms he uses over the series (So Last Season at work), his beast-mode head is his robot-mode arm. He actually pets it at times, and at one point, when he's "asleep", the head-hand is looking around on its own. Near the end of the series, he turns from the monitor he's watching, the head-hand turns toward it, and tracks back and forth as things happen onscreen. He also has his rubber ducky.
-   _The Boondocks_: Deborah Leevil the evil head of CEO of BET, holds a dog like other villains hold cats. It appears to be dead, which gives you an idea of her mental state.
-   The Big Boss of _C.O.P.S._ has Scratch, a vicious pet _weasel_, in case subtlety isn't your thing. A _cybernetic_ weasel.
-   A mad scientist on _Courage the Cowardly Dog_ had a right-hand rat named Rat. Rat mostly carried out errands for his manic-depressive master, but would also allow himself to be held and stroked if the morose scientist needed comforting.
-   In _Danger Mouse_, Baron Silas Greenback's Right-Hand Cat is a furry caterpillar named Nero.
-   In _Dragons: Riders of Berk_, recurrent antagonist Mildew has a pet sheep that seems to be the only living thing he loves, even more than all his dead wives. He's also often seen petting her or carrying her. The sheep also seems to agree with him in his hatred of dragons and help him willingly in all his schemes.
-   In _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_, Mandy has her pet dog Saliva, who's about the only creature (human, supernatural, or otherwise) that she openly loves. She takes great pleasure in forcing Grim to pamper Saliva or, given that he's a walking skeleton, let the dog bury him in the backyard.
-   Parodied in an episode of _Invader Zim_ titled "Voting of the Doomed". The shadowy figure of the Principal is seen stroking a beaver, which itself strokes a little green... thingy (it drops it and starts to cry).
-   A few _Kim Possible_ villains have toyed with the concept of the Right-Hand Cat:
    -   Gemini, the most straightforwardly "Bondish" villain on the show, has a yappy pet Chihuahua named Pepe.
    -   Camille Leon, who is a parody of Paris Hilton as a shapeshifting villainess, has a Sphinx cat named Debutante, who lives in her designer handbag.
    -   Ron Stoppable, when he is changed into a villain in "Bad Boy", takes to stroking a confused Rufus in a Blofeld-esque manner during a hand-wringing rant.
-   Like Daedalus (see above), The Sea Witch Wilhemine from _The Mighty Hercules_ has a pet bird named Elvira.
-   In the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ episode "Sparkle's Seven", Princess Luna at one point strikes the classic evil overlord pose while stroking a _goose_. The geese, part of the castle's security system, have been shown to be very ill-tempered, and the one in Luna's lap, while calmed, is giving the rest of the room the evil eye. This is all Played for Laughs, of course, as Luna is a Friendly Rival.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_:
    -   Suzy Johnson (Jeremy's Devil in Plain Sight sister) has a Right-Hand _Poodle_ whom she has trained to attack Candace.
    -   Also, in "Spa Day", Dr. Doofensmirtz adopts a stray kitten he dubs "Mr. Fluffypants", but the mischievous feline proves to be more trouble than he's worth when he accidentally sets off several of Dr. Doofensmirtz's old evil inventions.
-   An episode of _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_ has Mojo Jojo becoming a mob boss and the girls finding him sitting in the mayor's chair, with a little boy sitting on his lap while stroking his head in this manner. Mojo is using said boy as a way to intimidate the girls, who they believe has "cooties" that would kill them.
-   _ReBoot_:
    -   Hexadecimal, as an insane anthropomorphism of a computer virus, somewhat inexplicably, has a small round cute thing with a feline face called Scuzzy (as in a pun on "SCSI") as a pet. In one episode, Bob and Mike the TV find to their horror and sorrow that Scuzzy also doubles as Hexadecimal's Right-Hand Attack Dog: one that can grow impossibly large, move very fast, has very sharp teeth, and can clone itself as necessary.
    -   Her male counterpart, Megabyte, has Nibbles, a slug-like creature that was formerly sentient but reduced to that form after losing a game. Nibbles used to be, in a sense, Megabyte's father. Nibbles is the Null of Doctor Matrix, the father of Enzo and Dot, and the designer of the Gateway Command.
-   One episode of _Sabrina: The Animated Series_ has Sabrina accidentally turn the world into a _James Bond_\-style movie with her crush Harvey as the lead. Salem the cat ends up as the villain and has, of all things, a pet human that he holds on his lap and strokes on the head.
-   In _Sheep in the Big City_, the season one finale "To Sheep, Perchance to Dream" parodies the trope of villains stroking cats by having Sheep rub the belly of a baby in his lap when he's revealed to be the real villain.
-   When he's not off spying for his master, Hordak, or engaging in some other form of mischief, Imp from _She-Ra: Princess of Power_ fills this role. This has been taken further with his _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_ update, who is effectively silent so far and has spent 95% of his screen time hanging over his master. Hordak even gives the little guy an affectionate head rub in the fourth episode.
-   _The Simpsons_: In the episode "Duffless," Lisa makes an unwitting Bart the subject of her science fair project, in which she attempts to prove he's dumber than a hamster. After discovering, and hiding, the report, he does this routine with the hamster as he explains to her that she'll have to decipher a series of clues to find it (only to be quickly undercut when she finds it before he can finish explaining).
-   All the recurring villains other than Gargamel in _The Smurfs_ have a pet that is not a cat; Hogatha has a vulture, Chlorhydris has a toucan and Balthazar has a raven.
-   Dr. Robotnik from _Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)_ has a pet robotic bird named Cluck.
