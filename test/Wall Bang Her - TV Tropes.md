Caution: do not try this on brick.

**Jack:** Bianca wanted it 6, 7 times a day. Always standing up.  
**Liz:** Standing up? How would that even work?  
**Jack:** You're joking, right?  
**Liz:** _\[sheepishly\]_ Yeah...

In short, when two people are having sex against a wall or other vertical surface, often spontaneously. One of the most common sex positions in films and television shows, as it can be worked into almost any setting (since almost any setting will have a wall, a tree, etc.) and avoids the need for nudity, thereby allowing the scene to pass with a lower content-censorship rating. Its spontaneous nature also makes it popular when one or both partners is cheating, or the affair is forbidden for some other reason. In Real Life this _can_ be done, but is not as easy as it looks: holding someone up against a wall can get tiresome fast depending on the carrier's strength and endurance, and the person doing the wall-banging runs the risk of dropping their poor partner (which carries a significant risk of a self-inflicted Groin Attack).

Not to be confused with someone banging their head against a wall, or a Harvey Wallbanger (well, unless one of the participants happens to be named Harvey), or Right Through the Wall (though overlap with the latter is obviously possible), or Wallbonking (though that can end up looking like this), or firing squads. Also not related to the technique of "Wall-banging" in FPS games (which is about bullets going through walls and dealing decreased damaged to the person on the other side). Often includes Right Through His Pants.

The title is derived from Wall Banger, a page that has since joined the Permanent Red Link Club.

-   There exists at least one _Fullmetal Alchemist_ Yaoi doujinshi that feature Ed and Roy doing this, justified by the fact that Ed is depicted as much smaller than Roy in this particular artist's work, meaning he would be pretty easy to lift (it also uses Right Through His Pants with Roy). It's by the artist Daen. This is quite common in Daen's works.

-   _Thousand Shinji_: In a scene, Asuka mentions offhandedly that Shinji and she tried that position several times.

-   In one of the funniest scenes in _Baby Boy_, Jody is unable to sleep because his mom and her new boyfriend are having sex, rather loudly, in the other room. We see it, too - and it starts with a Wall Bang, but evolves into what can only be described as "the African Squat Fuck", _across the room_.

-   Happens in _The Joy Luck Club_ with the mom who later drowned her baby.

Played with _again_ when they burst through the door a second time, albeit with Alice now facing Dale, and no one seems to notice.

    Literature 

-   _Able Team_. In "Death Strike", Carl Lyons has been captured by the Unomondo organisation. When Gadgets and the Politician turn up to rescue him, thinking he's being horribly tortured, they find Lyons having sex with a nurse up against a door which his friends happen to open, causing her to knock herself out on the floor. Which is just as well as the nurse was a Unomondo agent sent to spy on him (he _had_ been tortured, but they'd switched to more subtle methods by then).
-   The expression also crops up a lot (though it's more often discussed than seen) in the _Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall_ septology.
-   According to Frank McCourt's memoir, _Angela's Ashes_, this was how he was conceived, and he refers to it as a "knee trembler".
-   This is the content of the one and only sex scene in _Atonement_, as detailed lengthily and lovingly. At least the author mentions how awkward the position would be if the participants weren't the same height. The loving detail is actually due to the literate male attempting to keep his stamina up. He notices stuff like their heights and how the light falls and how uncomfortable the position might be for her (in the corner of a library on a desk) in order to keep his mind off of the sex and thus last longer.
-   _The Bronze Horseman_ by Paullina Simons. Captain Belov solves the practical issues by constructing a shelf at groin height for his wife to sit on.
-   _The Chronicles of Dorsa_: Tasia stands up against a tree near the camp while having sex with Joslyn in the woods nearby for their second encounter.
-   _Discworld_: Alluded to in _Night Watch_; one of the Seamstresses asks Vimes if he wants a tuppenny upright. Vimes has to tell his younger self "it's a kind of donut," but even young Vimes suggests that he doesn't think that's what it really is, and "I think it's something rude."
-   In _Joe Ledger_ book _Dragon Factory_, Ledger and Grace do it this way under the shower. And then proceed to demolish his room with their vigorous lovemaking.
-   Older Than Feudalism nonfiction example: According to the _Kama Sutra_, "When a man and a woman support themselves on each other's bodies, or on a wall, or pillar, and thus while standing engage in congress, it is called the 'supported congress'."
-   _The Memoirs of Cleopatra_ by Elizabeth George has Julius Caesar making love to Cleopatra VII like this and promising that he won't let her touch the ground until it's over. Interestingly for this trope, the sex in that book is never really that graphic, including in this scene.
-   In the _Rizzoli & Isles_ _books_, a minor character exchanges sex in this way for a place to stay/eat/money. She's mildly disgusted, especially considering the open windows. She idly wonders if the man is showing off, which increases her disgust.
