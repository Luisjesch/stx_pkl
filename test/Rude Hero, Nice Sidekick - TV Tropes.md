Where the hero is anti heroic, their sidekick or lancer is nicer.

The Anti-Hero can be anywhere in the spectrum, from a Sociopathic Hero to a really virtuous but mean one. The sidekick, by contrast, openly cares about other people and tries to respect their feelings. The sidekick commonly tries to balance out the hero's mean disposition and/or to be their voice of reason. If the hero is rude because they just think oddly, the sidekick may be a Cloudcuckoolander's Minder.

Depending on whether the story is idealistic or cynical, a plot involving the two can either be:

1.  **The idealistic side**: The nice sidekick trying to turn the anti-hero into a nicer one and succeeds in the end.
2.  **The cynical side**: The anti-hero shows the sidekick that being nice won't do them any good. The sidekick being nice is portrayed as misguided.
3.  **The neither side**: Either nothing changes between the two, or the hero becomes slightly nicer and the sidekick becomes slightly meaner.

The niceness of the sidekick and the rudeness of the hero are relative: a mean sidekick to a _meaner_ hero will still count as this.

Subtrope of Foil. May overlap with Brooding Boy, Gentle Girl if the hero is a guy and their sidekick is a girl, or Captain Smooth and Sergeant Rough, when it's done with an Officer and a Gentleman and a coarse Sergeant Rock. Compare Noble Top Enforcer (the Evil Counterpart for the nice sidekick), Morality Chain (someone that keeps the borderline-good guy from turning bad), Morality Pet (someone who exists to humanize a bad guy/make them more relatable), and The Lancer. Often results in a Good Cop/Bad Cop situation. Hypocritical Heartwarming may also apply if the hero is harsh on their sidekick but even harsher on anyone else who doesn't treat them well.

Contrast the Sarcastic Devotee (who is generally ruder than their leader) and Psycho Sidekick (who's defined by being less moral than the hero). Certain variants can overlap with Defrosting Ice Queen. Sub-Trope to Aloof Leader, Affable Subordinate.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Attack on Titan_: At least initially, Armin is more gentle and compassionate compared to the fairly hotheaded Eren's hate-fueled kill-everything mentality. As time goes on, it's shown that Armin has a bit of a manipulative streak when it comes to dealing with his enemies, showing that he's not quite as nice as he seems.
-   _Berserk_: Guts is a Nominal Hero, and initially a '90s Anti-Hero, who is deliberately callous and mean to anyone who tries to make friends with him, partly for their own good. Puck, his Fairy Companion, is a cheerful soul with a strong moral compass, often criticizing Guts for antagonizing people and acting as his Morality Chain whether he likes it or not.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_: An example of being The Lancer than the sidekick, Alphonse Elric is very much the more approachable and affable of the Elric Brothers, despite often being confused for Edward Elric (and he being a soul sealed in a suit of armor). Ed meanwhile is a cynical individual due to the trauma he and his brother endured, the responsibilities of fixing what he has done, and just his mercurial personality. He does undergo Character Development that has him soften up a bit and open up to people.
-   Shiki from _The Garden of Sinners_ is a borderline psychotic sociopath who, nonetheless, is one of the "good guys" because most of the people she fights are even worse. Her sidekick and love interest Mikiya, on the other hand, is a compassionate and morally upstanding individual with whom everyone wants to be friends—including some of the villains Shiki has to fight later.
-   _Kill la Kill_: Ryuko is Hot-Blooded, belligerent, and prone to swearing, while Mako is incredibly supportive and nearly incapable of hating anyone. The two become best friends because of Mako's kindhearted personality, and Ryuko herself becomes a nicer person thanks to Mako's influence.
-   In _Blazblue Phase Shift_, the nice and caring Celica plays the nice sidekick to the sardonic and rude hero Bloodedge.
-   _Muhyo and Roji_ fit this, as the former is a Brilliant, but Lazy Insufferable Genius who is also a Jerk with a Heart of Gold, while the latter is a somewhat inept Nice Guy who has good people skills.
-   In _Girls und Panzer_, Katyusha, commander of the Pravda team, is a Tiny Tyrannical Girl who enjoys looking down on her opponents, both figuratively and literally. Her vice-captain Nonna is a quiet, levelheaded, and relatively polite individual.
-   Inverted with Usagi and Chibiusa from _Sailor Moon_. Usagi is a compassionate All-Loving Hero, while her sidekick Chibiusa a rude Bratty Half-Pint who loves to belittle Usagi. Chibiusa does get better after Episode 73 by becoming far less rude to Usagi and having a much better relationship with her, though she still has her habit of messing with Usagi every once in a while.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS_ has Yusaku and Kusanagi. While the protagonist, Yusaku starts out as a Jerkass Anti-Hero who has no problem speaking his mind and giving unsolicited criticism, and avoids practically all human interaction besides Kusanagi. In contrast, Kusanagi is his genuinely friendly support hacker as well as older brother figure, though Yusaku does become somewhat nicer and more willing to build bridges as the series progresses.
-   Inverted with Mametchi & Memetchi from _Tamagotchi_, Mametchi is the nice and compassionate hero of the series while Memetchi can be bossy and stubborn, she is also one of the two sidekicks of the series alongside Kuchipatchi.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_. Depending on the Writer, common in the Bat Clan (and surrounding).
    -   Robin (Dick, Jason, Tim, Steph and Carrie _not_ Damian) or Nightwing is nicer than the stoic, straight-laced Batman. This is even part of what made up Tim's argument that Batman needs a Robin, since having one to act helpful and kind balanced him out and helped smooth things over with law enforcement.
        -   Flipped when Dick became Batman and was paired up with a deadly-serious Robin in Damian.
    -   When he works with Cassandra Cain, his harsh, Terror Hero demeanor is often contrasted with her All-Loving Hero status, especially in how they treat criminals.
    -   When Huntress is teamed with another of the _Birds of Prey_, the person with her is almost always the nicer one.
    -   _Batgirl (2009)_: Stephanie is much more kind and upbeat than Oracle who tends to be rather strict, bordering on harsh.
-   _X-Men_: When the mean and rude Wolverine has a sidekick, they're usually the nicer one.
    -   Nightcrawler is most often used as comic relief.
    -   Kitty Pryde, before Wolvie had her taught ninja skills, was the innocent.
    -   Jubilee was also innocent before she had to face the Reavers to protect Wolverine.
-   Sonic and Tails in _Sonic the Comic_. Unlike the games continuity where he is laid-back and nice (though cocky), Sonic is terribly rude, self-centered, and immature while Tails is the nice one who would always be on the receiving end of Sonic's bullying.

    Fan Works 

-   _Agreement and Disputation_: While Watson can become ferocious when in a temper, he generally pays more attention to people's feelings and to social niceties than Holmes, who believes anyone who truly needs his genius will have to put up with his blunt manner. The doctor tells him more than once that his lack of politeness and tolerance will frighten off all potential clients, especially refined ones.
-   In _Chrysalis Visits The Hague_, the cynical, short-fused human lawyer Estermann and his Equestrian liaison Lyra Heartstrings, who is a lot nicer and bubblier than him, are becoming this.
-   Otacon of _Metal Gear Solid_ plays this role in _Stray_, but as a foil to Adamska instead of Snake.

     Film — Animation 

-   _Despicable Me 2_: Gru may have retired as a villain, but he's still a jerk to anyone who isn't part of his family. His partner Lucy, on the other hand, is a bubbly Nice Girl who's friendly to everyone.
-   _The Great Mouse Detective_: Basil, a Good Is Not Nice detective, has a tendency to be brusque and unconcerned with others (he has No Social Skills), while Dr. Dawson is a sensitive guy who gets involved in the adventure to begin with because he can't stand to see a little girl cry. Given that this is a _Sherlock Holmes_ story with mice, the dynamic between Basil and Dawson mirrors the one between Holmes and Watson. This being Disney, he (and Olivia) wind up defrosting Basil.
-   _Sherlock Gnomes_: Sherlock gets wrapped up in himself quite a bit and even treats Watson poorly. The considerably friendlier Watson sticks with him and tries to clean up the messes resulting from his harshness. It ends up deconstructed. Eventually even Watson has enough and temporarily collaborates with Moriarty due to Sherlock's poor behavior.
-   _Shrek_: Shrek is rather grumpy and crude, whereas his sidekick Donkey, as irritating as he may be, is much more well-meaning and out-going.

     Film — Live Action 

-   _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers (2022)_: Chip is quite cynical and uptight, while Dale is more easygoing and mild-mannered.
-   Maleficent: Maleficent is the Anti-Hero who curses an infant to fall into an eternal coma on her sixteenth birthday, while Diaval serves Maleficent because he owes his life to her, and is actually very fond of the infant Maleficent cursed. Maleficent eventually comes to like the kid, too, and tries to remove the curse.
-   _Sky High (2005)_: All the "hero" kids were obnoxious stuck up Jerk Jocks. All the kids relegated to "sidekick" were fairly decent (until Will got some Acquired Situational Narcissism upon becoming a hero).
-   _Deadpool (2016)_: The eponymous Deadpool is a foul-mouthed, perverse anti-hero, in contrast to the genuine Nice Guy and Gentle Giant, Colossus of the X-Men.
-   _Superbad_: Seth (Jonah Hill) is a foul-mouthed, misogynistic pervert who's incredibly rude to everyone, especially Fogell. Evan (Michael Cera), meanwhile, is friendly, considerate, and open towards others; unlike Seth, he openly objects to making out with Becca while she was intoxicated.
-   _Funny People_: George is a self-absorbed, cynical actor, while his sidekick Ira is generally well-meaning, though is constantly exploited by George. Deconstructed when Ira eventually gets fed up with George's nonsense and tells him off, which makes the latter have a Jerkass Realization.

    Literature 

-   _Diary of a Wimpy Kid_: Greg is the rude and jerky protagonist, while his best friend/sidekick Rowley is more cheerful and innocent (and constantly taken advantage of by Greg).
-   _Discworld_: Cynical, grizzled, Hates Everyone Equally Commander Sir Samuel Vimes, and honest, upright, and unfailingly polite Captain Carrot. Over the course of the books, Vimes softens a bit, and Carrot gets plenty of opportunities to show that being the only idealist in the city doesn't make him soft or dumb, but neither changes their basic nature.
-   Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in _Don Quixote_. While well-intentioned, Don Quixote's delusions of grandeur make him insufferable to those who meet him, while the good-natured, friendly Sancho Panza has a much better grounding in reality and sometimes does what he can to defuse dangerous or embarrassing situations.
-   In the _Gentleman Bastard_ series, the protagonist, Locke Lamora, is a fairly amoral character who is characterized as being somewhat obnoxious and letting his cleverness and tongue get ahead of him. His best friend and "sidekick", Jean Tannen, is a Genius Bruiser who is generally polite and friendly unless roused, and while still a con artist, is overall more moral.
-   _In Death_: Eve Dallas's partner Delia Peabody is much nicer and more feminine than Dallas is. Dallas makes use of this, having Peabody comfort shaken witnesses and relatives of murder victims, and letting Peabody play good cop to Dallas's bad cop.
-   Many incarnations of Dr. John Watson in the Sherlock Holmes stories. It's particularly notable in _Sherlock_ and _The Seven-Per-Cent Solution_, which play up Holmes' personal dysfunction.
-   In _The Witling_, Yoninne and Ajão have this dynamic. At first, young and hotheaded Yoninne, who swears like a sailor, has to make heroic efforts just to be cordial to the natives of Giri, almost all of whom are medieval psychic supremacists capable of killing her on a whim. It's down to sheer luck that she doesn't end up getting casually murdered, while her partner, the old and frail Ajão, relies more on diplomacy and intelligence to avoid an untimely death.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_ has used this trope throughout its run, though it is slightly less prevalent in the revived series. Because the Doctor's companions often play the part of Audience Surrogate, they also tend to be more sympathetic to the humans who have no idea what is going on, while the Doctor is rude, impatient, and brusque. Some of the more prominent examples:
    -   The First Doctor is strongly characterized as a crotchety old man, while _all_ of his companions are wholesome, friendly folks; Susan is a precocious young girl, while Ian and Barbra are responsible adults who try to keep things from getting too dangerous or out-of-hand. Companions that join later in the First Doctor's run mix up the formula a little, but not much.
    -   Mildly inverted with the relationship between the Second Doctor and Jamie; the Doctor often acts like a clown, while Jamie is the muscle, and because he lacks subtlety, he is often impatient with the people they encounter.
    -   Played quite straight with the Third Doctor and Jo Grant; the Doctor has very little patience with humans blithely claiming that whatever is going on is flat-out impossible, and rarely even tries to explain, so it's up to Jo to bridge the gap and smooth over his rudeness. On the other hand, when the Doctor encounters someone who is willing to suspend their disbelief long enough to actually understand the situation, he's a perfect gentleman.
    -   The Twelfth Doctor and Clara Oswald fit this trope to a T, to the point where Clara makes efforts to help her Doctor be more empathetic and nice to people, and the Doctor refers to her as his carer because "she cares, so I don't have to". As the series goes on, however, it becomes clear that the two of them aren't so different, with Clara revealing a ruthless streak of her own.
-   _Drake & Josh_: Drake is the self-centered, narcissistic ladies' man versus his more reasonable, outgoing, and considerate step-brother Josh, who gets exploited by Drake constantly. Deconstructed in "Josh Is Done", when Josh becomes fed up with Drake's attitude and decides to quit his friendship with him for good.
-   _Galavant_: At the start of the series, Galavant is arrogant, standoffish, and heartbroken. His squire, Sid, is much more affable and approachable despite being a Servile Snarker.
-   In _House, M.D._, Dr. Wilson and Dr. House have this dynamic; House is a Jerkass who very rarely shows anything other than total disdain for others' feelings and is only interested in the puzzles presented by their medical cases, while Wilson is an oncologist (a doctor specializing in cancer) who makes a habit of caring _too much_ for his patients and his friends. They rarely work together but are best friends, and House often uses Wilson to bounce ideas off of when he's stumped on a case. Appropriately, the characters of House and Wilson are based on Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who are also an example — note the similarity in their names (House/Holmes, Wilson/Watson).
-   Played With in _Monk_. Monk's first assistant, Sharona, is a Jerk with a Heart of Gold who nonetheless knows how to deal with people better than Monk, who has No Social Skills. Natalie is generally nicer and friendlier than Monk, although prone to Beware the Nice Ones moments.
-   _Sam & Cat_: Sam is generally pushy, rude, and aggressive, while Cat is generally friendly, sweet, and childlike.
-   Inverted with _Star Trek: The Original Series_. Captain Kirk is a charming Officer and a Gentleman. By contrast, his first officer Spock is more tactless and ruthlessly pragmatic. The fact that he's also The Stoic when he does these things probably doesn't do his image any favors.
-   _The Following_: Ryan Hardy and Mike Weston's dynamic is this at the very start. Ryan's influence, having to kill others, being tortured nearly to death, and having a fellow Federal agent dying brutally in front of him add a cruelness and sadism that only increases way more in Seasons 2 & 3.
-   _The Tick (2001)_: Deconstructed with Fiery Blaze and his sidekick Friendly Fire. Blaze insults and belittles Fire in private and public, makes him do all cleaning, mailing and other such cores, and over does it on fight practice. After Arthur (Tick's sidekick) points out these problems to him, Fire quits and moves in with Arthur and The Tick. Fire only rejoins Blaze when he sees what a drunken slopy mess Blaze is without him under the condition that Blaze treats him with more respect. During the whole process, Arthur beings questioning his partnership with The Tick after he starts to act slightly more like Blaze, but after meeting with a support group for sidekicks, Arthur realizes that The Tick is a legitimately good friend and by the time Arthur gets back to him, The Tick has already come to his senses.
-   _Wizards of Waverly Place_: Alex is the sly, snarky, and rebellious protagonist while her best friend Harper is The Ingenue. It also works if the sidekick is her brother Justin who has a better behavior than Alex.
-   _Xena: Warrior Princess_: The titular Xena and Gabrielle fit the mold. The former is the hardened fighter trying her hand at redemption while the latter is the plucky bard seeking adventure.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Warhammer 40,000_ has its usual twisted take on this: Ax-Crazy Blood Knight Kharn the Betrayer serves as his Primarch's cooler-headed sidekick in canon. The guy who kills his own men if he misses against the enemy, who believes " "Attack!" is the only order worth remembering", who gained his title after slaughtering both his men and the enemy for not fighting hard enough... Used to be the one with the better temper. And depending on said Primarch, _he might still be_.

    Video Games 

-   _Assassin's Creed: Unity_ is on the fence between inverting this and playing it straight. The player controls Arno, an Assassin who is in love with Elise, a Templar (the long-standing villains of the series), and they team up for many missions. One would call this an Inversion in that Arno has a relatively mild personality with a strong moral compass, while Elise is hotheaded, violent, and ruthless. But much of the plot revolves around Arno helping Elise track down her father's murderer, and the _player_ is often treated like a sidekick, which would make it a straight example, with _Elise_ as the "hero".
-   In _Disco Elysium_, your character is a suicidally depressed Defective Detective with substance abuse problems who regularly says and does outrageous, offensive things, while your partner Kim is quiet, professional, and tolerant. In a slight twist on the trope, though, this niceness is mostly down to how nice the two characters are to _the player character himself_ - he hates himself and tries to drown it in unhealthy coping mechanisms, while Kim is always open about his positive feelings towards him while calling him out for his worst actions. With other characters - especially with children - it's your player character who is the nice one, expressing genuine, open curiosity about other people where Kim's stoic presentation won't allow him to do so.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   _Every_ party member in _Final Fantasy VIII_ is this to Squall. Squall is so rude and blocked-off that the story always makes sure he's partnered up with someone able to handle the social situations that he only ever wants to wriggle out of (and complain about them in his Inner Monologue). They might be hyperactive like Zell and Selphie, more nurturing like Irvine and Quistis, or more blunt like Rinoa, but they are all far more interested in people than he is.
    -   When Sazh and Lightning travel together at the beginning of _Final Fantasy XIII_, he serves as a Plucky Comic Relief to her stoic grimness.
-   _Help The Hero_:
    -   The Hero (Count Thrashwood): A bit egotistical, but also a bit dim. He thinks he can do no wrong and that everyone else was put on this earth to admire or worship him. Add in a lot of narcissism about his good looks, and you've got, well... picture Prince Charming from Shrek, but give him some combat skills.
    -   The Sidekick (Percival): Aside from a few snarky retorts, he's the everyman we're supposed to identify with. He does the grunt work but also does the strategic thinking during the preparation for battle (what are the monsters' weaknesses that Thrashwood can exploit?).
-   _The King of Fighters_. The cheerful Kula and the mature, soft-spoken Maxima play nice sidekicks to the Anti-Hero K'.
-   Inverted in _Mega Man X_. X is nice and pacifistic to a fault, while Zero, his partner, is ruder and has no compunctions of killing his enemies when it's needed.
-   Otacon in _Metal Gear Solid_, a sweet, shy, and nerdy individual who tends to see a good side to everyone, even when those people are sexy terrorist assassins or giant nuclear death tanks, to Snake, who is cold, hardened, damaged, and struggles to be interested in other people (and although he chills out somewhat later on, he holds onto a sarcastic sense of humour and an overall aloofness). In-universe, Otacon does all the talking with their then-unknown sponsors in _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_.
-   Tails from the _Sonic the Hedgehog_ series is known to be mild-mannered and humble than Sonic, who is a bit cocky, but is nonetheless a nice guy.
-   This is the usual dynamic of the prosecutor/detective pairs in _Ace Attorney_
    -   Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth (competent but sarcastic and impatient) and Detective Dick Gumshoe (bumbling but good-natured)
    -   Prosecutor Franziska von Karma (whip-wielding ice queen) and Gumshoe (still good-natured but completely intimidated by her)
    -   Subverted with Prosecutor Simon Blackquill (_very_ scary convicted murderer) and Bobby Fullbright (perpetually smiling idealist); neither man is as he seems. Blackquill is only on Death Row because he's Taking the Heat for his mentor's daughter, who is _also_ innocent. Fullbright (or rather, the person impersonating him) is a sociopathic international spy who's killed at least two people.
    -   Prosecutor Nahyuta Sahdmadhi (aloof mystic who seems to find the very idea of defense attorneys blasphemous) and Ema Skye (a forensic scientist and happy to help the defence)
-   The titular character in the _Rance_ series is a hyper-violent Nominal Hero with a raging ego and little interest in anything outside of his most immediate impulses. His slave Sill Plain is a mild-mannered Nice Girl who just wants everyone to get along. Rance also forms similar dynamics with Rocky Bank, Sachiko Centers, and Russian Cullet in _Rance VI_, _Rance Quest_ and _Rance IX_, respectively, with each serving as temporary sidekicks to him in Sill's absence.
-   _Ratchet & Clank_ start off as this in the first game of their franchise. In it, Ratchet is a Glory Seeker, but when betrayed by Qwark, he develops a serious case of Revenge Before Reason and abuses Clank, who spends the entire game a Nice Robot who wants to save the galaxy. After his Heel Realization, Ratchet would mellow out and become a Deadpan Snarker All-Loving Hero.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 2_ has Nia and Dromarch. Nia is a Hot-Blooded and somewhat short-tempered Deadpan Snarker, while her Blade Dromarch is a polite and cool-headed guy who frequently goes out of his way to break up fights between his teammates.
-   _The World Ends with You_:
    -   Neku and Shiki. Neku is a fairly gruff and abrasive loner who doesn't think much of friendship and can say some fairly cruel things, although he gets nicer as the game goes on. Shiki is a Nice Girl who, despite being jealous of her best friend and being willing to call Neku out when he goes too far, gets along with most people.
    -   Beat and Rhyme, the first pair of other Players Neku encounters. Beat is hotheaded, impulsive, and somewhat rude, while Rhyme is relatively friendly if a bit reserved, and follows Beat's lead. It turns out that this is also a case of Sibling Yin-Yang, as Beat is Rhyme's older brother.

    Western Animation 

-   In _The Amazing World of Gumball_, Darwin is the (usually) nicer sidekick to the ruder Gumball. Lampshade hung on "The Sidekick" where Darwin, after finally standing up for being treated as a sidekick, impersonates Gumball by being a rude Deadpan Snarker. Gumball makes a comeback, impersonating Darwin as overly happy and optimistic.
-   _Animaniacs_ uses this trope a lot:
    -   The Brain is a condescending Insufferable Genius, while Pinky is a Minion with an F in Evil who still likes and admires Brain, no matter how much abuse he gets from him. They are still this in their own show, _Pinky and the Brain_.
    -   Slappy Squirrel is a cranky old lady. Her sidekick in all her segments is her nephew, the cheerful and adorable Skippy.
    -   Rita is an arrogant and sarcastic cat who is always accompanied by dimwitted Big Friendly Dog Runt.
-   _Atomic Puppet_: AP is extremely egocentric and tends to put down those he views as inferior or bothersome (which is _a lot_ of people), while Joey is the more polite of the two and can act as the Straight Man to AP at times.
-   _Big City Greens_: Cricket is the rambunctious and troublemaking son of the Green family who hates being serious, while his sister Tilly is silly, cheerful, and more level-headed, and serves as the voice of reason for his mishaps.
-   The title characters of _Cow and Chicken_. Chicken is the egotistical, cynical, and rude hero in contrast to his more kindhearted, playful, and easygoing sister Cow. Though inverted whenever Cow turns into her alter ego "Supercow".
-   _Dan Vs._: Dan is a mean and short-tempered Anti-Hero, in contrast to his Extreme Doormat sidekick Chris.
-   _Darkwing Duck_: The title character is a Jerk with a Heart of Gold who has "an ego the size of a small planet" and is prone to being dismissive towards people, especially if he feels they're being stupid or stealing his spotlight. At worst, he's a Well-Intentioned Extremist. His sidekick/Heterosexual Life-Partner Launchpad McQuack treats people in a much friendlier, more understanding way. Launchpad and Gosalyn were meant to "ground" Darkwing and keep him in check. This figures majorly in "Something Fishy", in which Launchpad's empathy undoes the damage caused by Darkwing butting heads with eco-warrior Neptunia.
-   _Duckman_: The title character is always abrasive and angry. His business partner Cornfed is a loyal and affable Hypercompetent Sidekick.
-   _Ed, Edd n Eddy_: Eddy is the arrogant, hot-tempered leader and his two sidekicks are: Ed, a Kindhearted Simpleton, and Edd, a sensitive guy who tries to be the voice of reason.
-   _The Flintstones_: Barney is the easygoing best friend/sidekick to the more aggressive protagonist Fred Flintstone.
-   Inverted with Mac and Bloo from _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_. Whereas Mac is kind, loving, mature, and has a sweet personality, Bloo often comes off as a selfish bully who is willing to harass his friends on most occasions.
-   While more of an Anti-Hero, space captain Zapp Brannigan from _Futurama_ is a Jerkass, while his co-pilot, the alien Kif Kroker, is a sensitive guy.
-   The principal antagonist to the _Go Go Gophers_ of Gopher Gulch is Army Colonel Kit Coyote, an arrogant, obstinate General Ripper that refuses to listen to reason. Much of the reason comes from Sergeant Okie Homa, a beleaguered underling to the Colonel. The sergeant is so genial that he's often found Breaking the Fourth Wall to invite the audience to "tune in next time."
-   _Goof Troop_: The hero, Max, is a good person but can be inconsiderate and selfish at times. His sidekick, PJ, is honest and kind to a fault.
-   _Invader Zim_: Zim is a brash, foul-tempered Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist, while his ditzy Minion with an F in Evil GIR is much friendlier.
-   _Johnny Test_: Johnny is an Annoying Younger Sibling who breaks it Once an Episode, though his more reasonable sidekick dog Dukey tries to get him to avoid doing so (and usually fails).
-   _The Legend of Korra_: The titular hero Korra is the brash and Hot-Blooded Anti-Hero. Asami, who takes the sidekick role in Book 3, is the rational, polite Nice Girl, being the Straight Man in this case.
-   _Looney Tunes_: In the shorts where Daffy Duck plays an arrogant Lord Error-Prone, Porky Pig is his cheerful, mild-mannered Hypercompetent Sidekick. "Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century" and its TV spin-off _Duck Dodgers_ are the quintessential examples.
    -   "Deduce, You Say!" exaggerates this relationship. While Daffy as Dorlock Holmes rudely interrogates innocent civilians, Porky's Dr. Watkins gets the villain to give himself up just by asking him politely.
    -   Daffy and Porky also have this dynamic in _The Looney Tunes Show_. The same trope also applies to their younger counterparts Plucky and Hamton in _Tiny Toon Adventures_.
-   Spike started off as this to Twilight Sparkle the grumpy antisocial pony in _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ prior to the latter's Character Development.
-   _Ren & Stimpy_: Ren is a violent Sociopathic Hero while Stimpy is a Bumbling Sidekick and Kindhearted Simpleton.
-   _The Simpsons_: Downplayed with Bart, a brash and mischievous prankster, and his friend Milhouse. Milhouse is not that nice (he can be pretty mean when he has a chance), but he's usually naive and submissive so it's easy for Bart to pick on him and take advantage of him.
-   _South Park_: The kind and innocent Butters has often taken on the role of sidekick to Villain Protagonist Cartman.
-   _Tangled: The Series_: Inverted; Rapunzel largely maintains her sunny, kindhearted and excitable disposition from her introductory film. Her handmaid/bodyguard/best friend Cassandra has a much darker and sterner personality which ultimately becomes harsher in hindsight when she becomes a villain.
