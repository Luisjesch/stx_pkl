Going out with a bang, in more ways than one.

_"This is some fucked up foreplay, eh?"_

Sex and violence: two great tastes that taste great together.

You got death, and you got life (conception). You have love and you have hate.

Vampires and the Combat Sadomasochist are particularly prone to this kind of characterization, especially when Hemo Eroticism is involved.

Related to Destructo-Nookie, where the two scenes become one… well, you know what we mean. May involve a Phallic Weapon.

May take less honest tropes such as Belligerent Sexual Tension, Slap-Slap-Kiss and Kiss-Kiss-Slap, and The Masochism Tango to a new "exciting" level. Of course, Sex Is Violence takes _**this**_ trope to a new "exciting" level. The violent Older Brother to Does This Remind You of Anything?

This trope can be the result of a character falling in love with another character's violence, or a character expressing love through violence.

The distinction between this trope and Sex Is Violence is quite subtle — this trope is about them mixing together, and becoming one somehow. Sex Is Violence is about a character becoming flatly sexually aroused by fighting, to a point where it may stop. It also frequently overlaps with Consuming Passion, which is when the line between sex and cannibalism are blurred.

Compare Life/Death Juxtaposition when the sex relates to a creation motif and the violence relates to a destruction or desolation motif. See Coming and Going when sex and death are happening in the same scene. Not to be confused with Gorn, though they may overlap.

-   In "Swordplay" by Wilkinson Sword, a man and a woman have a sexually charged sword fight, each gradually losing pieces of clothing to the other's blade. It ends with the man falling back onto a bed, the woman standing over him before tossing her sword away to land across his on the floor.
    
    Foreplay meets swordplay.
    

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Beastars_ is practically built on this trope, more explicitly than anything before it. As it is set in a World of Funny Animals, and conflicts between herbivores and carnivores underlie the main plot, there are comparisons between predation and sex all over the place:
    -   There is actually one scene where Legosi gets attacked while he is blinded and unable to smell his attacker, so right in the middle of the fight he grabs them and kisses them on the mouth so that he will be able to identify them later by their taste.
    -   During another battle with a villain Legosi is trying to capture alive, the villain jumps out of a window to what could be his death and Legosi leaps after him and grabs him, holding him close, and after they land the bad guy says that was the first time he had ever been hugged.
    -   And then there's the love hotel incident between Legoshi and Haru. While hiding there, they begin to make out, and it looks like Haru is going to get to take Legoshi's virginity. But they end up in a weird situation where Haru seems to be trying to submit for being eaten. They break themselves out of the carnal urges, but it ruins the mood for the sexual urges.
-   In _Kill la Kill_, Mako gets turned on when firing a heavy machine gun. As many people then said _"A woman loves a huge cannon."_
    
    **Ryuko:** _(English Dub)_ get down from there Mako! It's not safe!
    
    **Mako:** (moaning) Oh, Yes!
    
-   CLAMP's fond of it, especially in _X1999_, when Fuuma licks Kamui's neck, stabs him, then kills their sister.
-   Genkaku towards Nagi in _Deadman Wonderland_. What with Genkaku getting turned on by Nagi killing, trying desperately to get Nagi to join the Undertakers, and getting jealous and angry at Karako for giving Nagi a Cooldown Hug. Not to mention that he tells Nagi that what he says is "cute", and that Nagi's hand has become very cute too (after Nagi's hand was cut off by Hibana) and licking the blood off of Nagi's stump of an arm. Genkaku's obsession with Nagi is eventually shown outright with Genkaku actually coming out and telling Nagi he "loved him" before attempting to kill him.
    -   The author ended up killing off both Genkaku and Nagi. Later, Mockingbird was introduced, who has a similar sort of Blood Lust and kinky way of flirting and fighting with Ganta and Senji.
    -   Even before then there was Minatsuki. When she first revealed her psychopathic personality to Ganta, she proclaimed that she would kill him, cut up his body, then "cum in \[his\] formaldehyde".
        -   Ganta had just met Minatsuki the day before, and her (deceptive) first suggestion was, "Let's bust out of here and get married."
-   _Full Metal Panic!_:
    -   Gauron towards Sōsuke. Made especially clear in the novels, where he apparently had some very vile fantasies during and after their fight of killing Sōsuke and raping his corpse. And the way he "consummates" their relationship is by goading Sōsuke into killing him. Yeah, apparently scoring a homerun with him involves death. Gauron is also shown to get sexual arousal from violently cutting up and killing people and breaking their spirits.
    -   And then there's the evil female scientist from the first arc (in Khanka), who has a... thing for Erotic Asphyxiation. As further shown in the novels, it's suggested that she actually _wants_ to make Gauron angry, so that he'll hurt her and choke her. Apparently she gets off on being abused by him as much as he does doing that to her.
-   Ladd and Lua's relationship in _Baccano!_ is filled to the brim with this: He's a shameless Ax-Crazy Psycho for Hire that expresses love by telling you that he'll kill you last, and she's a disturbingly serene, probably suicidal devotee longing for the day that he sneaks up behind her and murders her. It's a match made in a sadomasochist's Heaven.
-   Creed and Train in _Black Cat_—most notably in the anime. Creed is very obviously a masochist Stalker with a Crush when it comes to Train (though he can also be a sadist when it comes to dealing with others). Train, on the other hand, is absolutely disgusted with how Creed seems to keep getting a boner when he beats him up. In one scene, Train is particularly disturbed when, after fighting, Train ends up in a rather compromising position on top of Creed. Creed acts like he had an orgasm, even creepily calling out, "Oh Train, you're the best!" And then there's the time when Creed begs for Train to shoot him because once he's shot him, they'll "be bonded forever."

-   Tsukuyomi of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_. Whenever she fights Setsuna, the bloodlust is literal.
    -   There's also her line which suggests sexual pleasure that she has at the thought of fighting Negi after witnessing his new badass state. "How utterly delicious he must be!" (she says with her tongue out, while blushing, and a heart in her speech bubble)
-   _Queen's Blade_: Nyx's fighting style depends on it, as she quite literally allows her sentient staff (Funikura) to tentacle rape her in exchange for magical power. During which, it empowers her by forcing one of its tentacles into her mouth and makes her swallow several large mouthfuls of what appears to be semen. She's usually left mortified after the effect has worn off, but definitely seems to enjoy it while it happens.
-   Medusa and Stein's fight in _Soul Eater_. Stein's the one who gets called a sadist, but both are clearly enjoying themselves to the point of this trope.
    -   In the manga, the longer Giriko's last fight goes on with Maka, the more it descends into this. It gets to the point that you could replace "chainsaw" with "penis" and it would make just as much sense. He even pins her to a bed by her wrists and threatens to rape her at one point, only to remember that he does not have a penis anymore.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist_, the amusing Serial Killer Barry the Chopper will reference physical attraction in terms of how much he wants to chop someone up. For example, in a scene where he is telling the heroes about the homunculi, he references a great desire to do this to Lust, but expresses disinterest in Envy who he describes as "too stringy".
-   _Get Backers_ has the fighting between Takuma Fudou and Ban. Don't say that Fudou's "throbbing desire" to force Ban to "give his body to him" isn't an allegory for rape.
-   There's lots of this in _Wolf Guy - Wolfen Crest_. Pretty much everything that comes out of Ryuuko's mouth has to do with this trope. Kuroda takes a break from blowing up stuff (and students) to try to rape the meganekko with his gun. Fortunately, Inugami interrupts him. And now Haguro decides to up his freakiness by beating up Chiba and then kissing him, taking that opportunity to tear out his tongue, and then rape him. All because Inugami (whom Haguro is obsessed with) happened to run into him in the street earlier. Also, Haguro topped himself after Aoshika got released from her chains, with him fighting Inugami he got to slice two of Inugami's fingers off, then Haguro eats them and gets a boner for managing to injure Inugami.
-   Depraved Bisexual Shira from _Blade of the Immortal_ has habits that are sickeningly perverted, twisted, and violent, such as cutting people up while he rapes them.
-   Hisoka of _Hunter × Hunter_ is impatiently waiting for Gon and Killua to become strong enough for them to be an enjoyable challenge in a fight at the end of which he would kill them. He also seems to get quite aroused about the whole thing too. His wording of how he can't wait to "pluck the fruit that hasn't ripened yet" doesn't help either.
    -   This was made explicitly sexual with a Speech-Bubble Censoring incident where, while talking to the two boys, the speech bubble hiding Hisoka's modesty shifts upwards between panels.
    -   The anime does away with all subtlety and has Hisoka get an erection while fighting Gon in the 200+ floors of the fighting tower while internally commenting that he's "getting hard" and looking down at his crotch.
-   _Reborn! (2004)_: Glo Xinia had quite a bit of this going on with Chrome. Considering how during his fight with Chrome he grabbed her hard enough to cause her pain, kept getting in her face and told her things like: "You seem to like being touched by men. Your blushing cannot betray your desires." "Give me MORE!" (after hearing her screams of pain) and "It's time to eat... that ring and you!" It's hinted he might've done something to her had Mukuro not shown up, allowing her time to escape. Also, when fighting Mukuro he comes out with this line: "Is that girl so precious to you? Then I'm going to take my share of such a precious girl right before your eyes. This could just be the best situation, don't you think? My appetite for that girl just keeps getting better!" and "Don't worry Chrome, I will take good care of you for MUKURO TO SEE!"
    -   Depraved Homosexual Lussuria towards Ryohei. It starts getting ever so slightly disturbing when he's hitting on jail bait and is insinuated to have necrophiliac tendencies as well (in his words his favorite bodies are the "wasted, cold, unmoving" ones). Unfortunately, Ryohei goes topless during their fight and this only serves to make Lussuria his hardcore fanboy. In fact, Lussuria actually openly ogles Ryohei's muscular physique, says that he's "just his type" and promptly decides to take him home and make him a part of his "collection" after he's kicked the shit out of him.
    -   And Mukuro's fight with Tsuna was pretty much equal parts beating him up, trying to possess his body, and dry humping him from behind.
-   _Hajime no Ippo_: Bryan Hawk. He pretty much only cares about sex and violence. If he can't get enough violence, he needs sex to compensate for it. It's also implied that he gets sexually aroused from beating up his opponents (or at least Takamura).
-   Episode 20 of _Black Butler_ features Sebastian chained to the wall and being whipped by an angel decked out in S&M gear and describing the excruciating sweetness of the pain being inflicted upon him in a seductive tone.
    -   Grelle Sutcliffe is a chainsaw-wielding psychopath that is very forward about her attraction to Sebastian, within the same five minutes talking about both wanting to cut him into pieces and bear his child.
-   _Air Gear_: Shalott and Arthur's battle with Agito featured Albert in an S&M type relationship with Shalott and both of them getting aroused and excited while beating up Agito and at the thought of killing him. One scene worth mentioning was the one where Arthur caressed the back of Agito's head while pelvic thrusting against him and nibbling on his ear before stabbing him. Another scene worth mentioning was the one where Shalott kicked Agito to the ground before straddling him and threatening to tear out his teeth before saying he could "have a lick" if he wants.
-   _KonoSuba_: Taken to literal extremes with Darkness, who's a full-blown masochist which is why she became a Crusader.
-   _Maken-ki!_: Love Espada already has an insatiable libido to begin with, but as a knight, nothing gets her off quite like a display of raw power and aggression. Such as when she took an attack from Azuki's newly evolved Maken, in chapter 79. It was strong enough to draw blood from her, causing her to smile with a full faced blush as she _literally squirt_.
    
    **Espada:** _\[internal monologue\]_ "Here she IS ♥! The one who makes me numb... and WET ♥"
    

-   _Under Grand Hotel_:
    -   The yaoi manga features this, as things like Prison Rape are common. The most notable one would have to be Swordfish raping his lover Sen to almost death.
    -   And in the first few scenes we see Lain Brody he gives Sen a blowjob, strips him, drugs him and outright molests him as he's drugged (including telling him "No way in hell am I letting Swordfish kill you. Because he doesn't love you. I'm the only one that can kill you."), rapes him with a _mop handle_, ties him up and hides him in a dryer. And when Swordfish finds Sen he gives him CPR. Lain responds to this by stabbing Fish in the arm with a fork and tries to stab him again while screaming at him, "Get off of Sen! He belongs to me!" Immediately after that Lain is shot and killed by security guards.
-   Alucard of _Hellsing_ enjoys doing something of the sort with all his victims/enemies. Special mention goes to his "battle" with Rip Van Winkle. It didn't help that in the manga, it's drawn pretty much exactly like a hentai scene, down to the ridiculously intense blush on Rip's cheeks when Alucard drinks her blood. And her constant wriggling and gasping under his hands as he slowly inserts her musket through her body.
    -   And there's also Jan Valentine wanting to rape, kill and rape Integra again (in that order).
    -   Alucard's relationship with Integra can also be interpreted as this. He is excited by her resolve and will for battle, and he always impales his victims when she watches, once even asking if it 'excited' her.
-   _D.Gray-Man_ has Tyki Mikk acting rather excited at the thought of killing Allen. Some notable scenes include Tyki "killing" Allen (which resembled a sort of "violation," with Tyki sticking his hand into Allen), the suggestive dialogue with Tyki telling Allen, "Don't be so cold, boy. An Exorcist made a Noah strip down to his underwear. Was that the first time you did it? Do you think it was destiny for it to be us?" and Tyki seeming miffed when Allen tells him that he'd done it to many people before. During their fight later, there's another Does This Remind You of Anything? moment of this nature with Tyki telling Allen, "This is giving me the thrills. I'll break you, one more time, with this hand!"
-   In _Future Diary_ immediately after Yuno and Yukki have sex Yuno grabs her axe and pursues Yukki with it while both are still in their underwear.
-   In one scene _Paprika_ is held captive in her dream by her Stalker with a Crush Osanai. Some brief fondling occurs and then Osanai pushes his hand under her skin which causes Paprika a lot of pain and withdraws Chiba the naked secret-identity of Paprika, but before further molesting can take place his boss tries to kill Paprika/Chiba by wrapping her in his vines and attempts to suffocate her by sticking the vines down her throat.
-   _Black Lagoon_: This trope pretty much sums up Hansel and Gretel's awful backstory.
    -   A soldier witnesses Roberta killing, beats her and holds her down at gunpoint. The soldier attempts to get Roberta to join him and she pretends to be sexually aroused by all the violence. She then fools him into thinking she's taking off her pants to proceed with intimacy with him before she hits him with a weapon hidden in her belt. She then smiles a huge Slasher Smile before beating the man to death.
-   _Peacemaker Kurogane_: The old merchant Yamatoya who picked up Suzu off the street entirely for the purpose of raping him meets his end when Suzu brutally slaughters him in revenge for being raped right after Yamatoya spent a few moments fondling him.
-   The magnificent fight between Casshern and Sophita in episode 4 of _Casshern Sins_ is quite obviously this, what with Sophita proclaiming her love for Casshern with every other swing of her sword. The look on her face as she slowly impales him is pretty orgasmic.
-   _Trigun_: The end of the first Trigun manga dares you to see Knives 'rebirth' scene and not to think of anything involving gynaecology or rape. It actually seems to involve Death by Childbirth. Then it gets worse when Knives grabs Vash and forces him to deploy his Angel Arm. _While standing nude behind him and obviously enjoying his pain very, very much_ — which, by the way, isn't the only time he goes full frontal. It's even more disturbing when you know that men who get raped anally by other men get an erection. And that it's his twin brother, of course.
-   _Let Dai_: In the first few volumes, Dai and Jaehee spend as much time hurting each other as they do treating each other romantically. Dai seems to be under the illusion that severely beating Jaehee, tying him to train tracks and then stealing his wallet means he loves him. Jaehee doesn't exactly agree.
-   _Beelzebub_: Yolda aims to kill Oga one minute, then kisses him the next. She also renders Aoi unconscious by caressing her cheek.
-   _Star Driver_: Madoka Kei. Even when you consider that it involves playing around with awesome giant robots in a Scenery Porn\-eriffic alternate reality, she enjoys Cybody combat way too much.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Yami Marik is a bit like this—having been created by the normal Marik as a mechanism to cope with the pain of getting these ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs carved into his back, Yami Marik is a masochist who likes to set up Shadow Games that cause as much pain as possible. It's implied that he gets off on it to a degree, and even worse, that he assumes his opponents are as well...
-   _High School Of The Dead_: Saeko _really_ gets into fighting Them after Takashi accepts her for the repressed Blood Knight she is and grants her a real sword. Complete with still frame of her in combat screaming "Yes!" superimposed with the text "I'm wet!".
-   Like the above example, Hidan from _Naruto_ is a bit like this as well. His whole religion (Jashin) is about worshiping his god by causing pain to himself. His jutsu is an extension of that, ingesting another person's blood and then injuring himself to injure the other person. His dialogue and expressions really accurately show you how much he's getting off on the pain. It's made even more obvious in the anime.
-   This is a major theme in _Speed Grapher_. All of the euphorics abilities to kill are derived from their sexual fetishes. Understandable, as the series is a criticism of fetishism and sexual freedom.
-   _House of Five Leaves_: At the beginning of the story, you never know if Yaichi is going to shiv Masa... or kiss him.
-   Occurs several times in _Perfect Blue_ like when Mima is raped at a club and when she attacks a guy, stabbing him to death and the scene switches back and forth between that scene and another scene where she's getting photographed naked. And at the end, she's stripped naked and almost raped and killed by Me-Mania but Mima knocks him out by slamming a hammer into the side of his head.
-   A half human half spider hybrid appears in the first OVA of _Angel's Feather_. When he appears he wraps Shou up in his web, caresses him, gets close to his face, sticks his finger in his mouth which causes Shou to blush, and licks him before trying to murder him by penetrating his body with his pincher.
-   In _A Cruel God Reigns_ Greg seems to really get off on the fact that before he rapes him, he usually beats Jeremy bloody. When Jeremy tries to not come home from boarding school over the weekends, Greg lashes out and says that since he hasn't come home to be his Sex Slave, he's had to physically restrain himself from hitting Sandra—significant in that this is the first time Greg beats Jeremy. Later on, Jeremy tells Ian during a moment of Intimate Psychotherapy that he wants Ian to hurt him while he is doing it.
    
    **Jeremy**: I'm breaking into pieces! Destroy me more, more! Break me! Kill me!
    
-   _Bleach_:
    -   Bambietta has a violent, passionate personality. Her method of "de-stressing" is to choose a handsome, male subordinate and encourage him to expect a sexual encounter. Whether sex actually occurs is ambiguous, but the encounter always ends with her slicing him to pieces. Her female friends are irritated by the frequency with which she does this, and the mess it causes.
    -   The first ever Kenpachi, the original Yachiru, is Zaraki's idol and role-model. When they fight all-out, the thoughts between them blur the line between excessive battle-lust and sexual attraction. When Zaraki finally defeats her, Yachiru admits he's the only man who ever made her happy. When he realises she's dying, Zaraki screams in grief.
-   In _Sword Art Online_, Kyouji fell in love with Shino because she shot a robber with his own gun. He becomes a Serial Killer out of revenge for being tricked into ruining his character in a gun-based video game/gambling site. He tells all this to Shino while trying to seduce her while holding a syringe full of poison against her skin and planning to rape and then murder her if she doesn't love him.
-   _Tokyo Ghoul_ partakes in this trope on occasion, with some Ghouls blurring the lines between intimacy and murder.
    -   Rize primarily hunted men she found attractive, going on dates or otherwise luring them in with her looks. She goes on a date with Kaneki and then holds him close while telling him in a seductive whisper that she's interested in him... right before tearing a chunk out of his shoulder. When she sees the shocked and horrified look on his face, she moans and writhes in excitement. Then she breaks out the tentacles and uses them to "gently scramble" his insides.
    -   Depraved Bisexual Tsukiyama lives and breaths this trope, blurring the lines between amorous and murderous intentions. He admits to having found Touka attractive in the past, which is why he wants to decorate the church aisles with her insides. His entire relationship with Kaneki revolves around him being a Stalker with a Crush that wants to eat him, and playing out normal courtship (chatting about books over coffee, bringing him flowers, being his Meal Ticket) while fantasizing about the day when he'll have his "ultimate ingredient". In Love with the Mark, he continues to tangle up amorous intentions with culinary ones.
    -   In the anime Nico sees Yamori stabbing him through his torso with his arm as foreplay as he moans and holds his hand afterwards, telling him they should save the rest for when they get home.
    -   The sequel gives us two more disturbing examples, with the Ghouls "Torso" and "Nutcracker". One decapitates women and keeps their limbless bodies around as "lovers" that he masturbates to, while the other is a Dominatrix that goes from giving her victims a footjob to crushing their testicles and drinking them like oysters.
        -   Torso develops a disturbing obsession with Mutsuki which he stated in his diary, which stems from the latter being biologically female and having scars which is his fetish fuel. He ends up stripping and beating up Mutsuki in a manner resembling Attempted Rape and later kidnaps him, telling him that they are getting married, while revealing his limbs that he cut off and he had put a wedding ring on one of Mutsuki's fingers.
    -   Aside from Eto's suggestive language in chapter 56 Kaneki recognized her as Takatsuki and thanked her following her revealing her feelings for him while trying to both kill him and licking his eye. Their whole battle feels sexually charged, and there's a lot of jokes about how Kaneki is literally eating Eto's you-know-whats. Eto also spends quite a lot of her screen time spreading violence, torture, and mind raping people while being flirtatious and completely naked.
    -   Mutsuki himself is revealed to have a psychotic attraction to his mentor/teacher Sasaki/Kaneki which stemmed from the latter's kindness to him and his jealousy at seeing Sasaki and Touka together. When Uta disguises his face to look like his beloved mentor, he stabs Uta/Sasaki repeatedly in the face and neck in a fit of madness while declaring his love for him. He then proceeds to cuddle with Uta/Sasaki while thinking about how Sasaki is his alone and undresses from the top down while sitting atop Uta/Sasaki and acting in an intimately sexual manner or at least grinding his body against his in a manner of forcing his love on him.
    -   Ishida Sui has another comic called "The Penisman" featuring a character even more blatant than Nico: Carnivoreman. He's a monster with a goth Bishonen appearance. While some monsters in the comic have a thing for female victims, Carnivoreman has a thing for male victims. In particular, to those men he takes a liking to he has a fetish for eating them and the narrative describes his cannibalism as being equivalent to sex for him.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_ has a scene where a Soldier Heartless rips out the heart from a woman (who's implied to be a prostitute) while she's flirting with Sora. Then the Soldier crushes the heart within his claws.
-   _Angel Core_, a 2 episode hentai OVA. There's this disturbing scene with some militia guys ready to torture and rape two girls. One of them takes a knife and gouges out the eye of one of them. In pain, she begs them to give it back to her, but the soldier simply smashes it with his boot and says "oops!". Not happy with that, one of them suddenly gets the idea of raping her through the empty and still bleeding eye socket. Thankfully, it didn't happen, thanks to the other girl begging for her.
-   Kusuko's insane father in _Adekan_ is a powder box merchant who enslaves low-born young women and sells them to men to be abused, after murdering his low-born wife for unverified suspicions that she was cheating on him, he then turns around and imprisons his daughter in a Gilded Cage while telling her terrifying tales of the outside world... and having sex with a girl who looks like a carbon copy of her on the side. Not horrifying enough for you? To keep his daughter in line, he tells her scary stories about a monstrous yuurei, Nainai-sama, who haunts their box-maze mansion. Except Nainai-sama is real...
-   When girls in _Yuri Kuma Arashi_ are about to get violently eaten by bears (who are also girls) it's interposed with what looks like lesbian sex.
    -   Also, while Yurika certainly loved Reia, the latter did not feel the same. This led to Yurika eating Reia out of jealousy and possessiveness and later trying to do the same along with what looked like Attempted Rape to her daughter Kureha due to the Strong Family Resemblance.
-   A _very_ disturbing example from _Danganronpa 3_: during Chisa's brainwashing in _Side:Despair_, she constantly squirms around in her seat as she watches the video of the Student Council's Mutual Killing Game, almost as if she's about to have an orgasm. Not helping matters is that the camera occasionally shows her legs twitching or her breasts heaving. It gets even worse when Mukuro inserts metal rods _**directly into Chisa's brain**_, making her moan and twitch even more. The implication is that Chisa's nerves are being directly stimulated, forcing her to conflate the torture with pleasure.
-   _Mnemosyne_. The premise of the show is that the main heroine is immortal and the show takes full advantage of that. Sex and violence often occur concurrently.
-   _In These Words_ builds its whole premise and plot around this, alternating very explicit and detailed sex scenes with violent physical fights, psychological torture and sexual torture, so as to demonstrate the twisted dynamic between the two protagonists. Asano, the profiler on one hand and Shinohara, the supposed criminal on the other hand.

    Comic Books 

-   This is one of the main themes of _Watchmen_. Almost every character has some kind of fetish — Silhouette and Hooded Justice were implied to be homosexual S&M practitioners, The Comedian and arguably Silk Spectre I apparently has a thing for sexual violence, and Nite Owl I discusses it at length in his book — in fact, the only character you might say is "innocent" is the naked guy with the big blue dong.
    -   This is most clearly exemplified in the relationship between Silk Spectre II and Nite Owl II — they share their first kiss after beating up some thugs in an alleyway, but they aren't physically able to consummate their relationship until they both go out on a rescue mission in Nite Owl's airship in full costume.
-   Also used in _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_. With Alan and Mina screwing for the first time in a cottage while Mr. Hyde works out his pent up aggression on a captured Martian tripod
-   _Batman_: In the "Cacophony" mini-series, the Joker's stated dreams are to humiliate Batman, kill him, and then violate his corpse sexually.
-   There's a reason why it's called Sin City. There are two things you'll probably remember: prostitutes and strippers and grizzled anti-heroes killing bad guys by the truckload. This is a re-occurring trend in the works of Frank Miller. This also appears in _The Dark Knight Strikes Again_, _All-Star Batman & Robin, the Boy Wonder_, and _Holy Terror_.
-   _Savage Dragon_ has had plenty of T along with bloody violence. The women have the Most Common Superpower and the violence ranges from Black Comedy to horror, depending on Erik Larsen's mood. In fact, there was a Dragon miniseries called _Sex and Violence_.
-   There was an _X-Force_ miniseries titled "Sex & Violence". It was collected in trade paperback by the same name.
-   During the _Secret Six_ series, Catman and his ex Cheshire are duking it out alongside their respective teams. In the middle of the fight, Cheshire suddenly demands that Catman make love to her... and Catman actually considers it.
-   The first sex scene in _Sex Criminals_ is Suzie and Jon trying to enter The Quiet (what they call the Time Stands Still effect when they climax) to escape from their latest robbery.
-   In _Batwoman #4_, the scene of Bette being brutally beaten, stabbed, and left for dead is intercut with the scene of Kate and Maggie having sex for the first time.
-   Perhaps the whole point of _Lady Death_, and by extension a lot of other "bad girl" comic characters. A Dark Action Girl Ms. Fanservice character, pale as a corpse and dressed in leather fetish gear, hacking up demons and other monsters by the dozens every other issue. The covers will usually make this extra blatant by showing her in a pin-up pose on top of a pile of skulls.
-   _Black Order_: Pretty much said word-for-word by Proxima Midnight in regards to how she and her husband Corvus Glaive have sex. She sees no difference between the 'battlefield or the bedchamber', and to her at least, there's a way to 'win' or 'lose' the encounter. Corvus for his part once gushed that he was 'defeated every night when the sun goes down' by Proxima, so apparently, it's definitely not unpleasant to 'lose'.
-   In the Widowmaker arc of _The Punisher MAX_, Frank ends up chained to a bad as he watches a mafia widow's sister bludgeon the widow to death with a baseball bat, then immediately have sex with Frank, then blow her brains out once she's done.
-   _Vampirella vs. Hemorrhage_: Hemorrhage describes Vampirella as "sex and death... the whole thing squeezed into one bittersweet package''. Of course, Vampirella in general is strongly associated with both bloodlust and Vampires Are Sex Gods.

-   In the _Touhou Project_ fanfic _Imperfect Metamorphosis_, Marisa Kirisame experiences this when she uses Yukari's "And the Sun Rises Red" Spellcard on Yuka.
-   _Harmony Theory_: Charisma is sometimes turned on by the idea of others being injured.
-   In _Supergirl_ fanfic _Hellsister Trilogy_, Satan Girl gets genuinely aroused by fighting, hurting and killing. The actuality or the promise of violence turns her on. After blowing up a starship she had sex straight afterwards.
    
    "Satan Girl was in a state of excitement that was almost sexual arousal. Her mouth was open and she was sucking in breath, probably trying to curse and not being able to get words out, her hate being so strong. Her lips twitched with the effort. Her arm was raised and it was coming forward so quickly a corona of air friction formed about it."  
    Kara's arm blocked it, parried, as her other hand smashed hard into Satan Girl's mouth.  
    No more time for reflection. No time for analysis. The battle was on.
    
-   Hivefled's prequel _Reprise_ is as literal as the phrase "Torture Porn" can possibly be. This is the Grand Highblood and Condesce's whole _thing_, played for either Nightmare Fuel and/or Fanservice, depending on the reader.
-   _Rosario Vampire: Brightest Darkness Act II_: In chapter 32, the scenes of Moka, Mizore, and Kurumu consummating their relationships with Tsukune, Dark, and Rason, respectively, are intercut with ones of Yukari and Kokoa sparring outside.
-   _At the Centerfold of the Storm_: A very rare case of this trope. Apparently thanks to years of sexual tension, Kim and Shego _really like_ beating the crap out of each other. And getting their Relationship Upgrade does little to quell their appetite, as they seem to be just as... competitive in the bedroom.
-   _Sinners_ features this with another pairing between enemies, Percy and Luke. Vampirism as a whole retains the traditional Forbidden Fruit subtext, complete with some very sweaty, heavy-breathing, back-scratching bites. Percy's attempts to suppress his bloodlust are distinctly reminiscent of his even less successful attempts to ignore the regular old lust Luke inspires-he even calls the experience of feeding on somebody "seductive" and "almost Better than Sex". And his control on both ends fails at the same time, leading to a passionate Wall Bang Her\-style makeout while he's still covered in blood. Luke didn't seem to mind; he considerately sucked the blood off Percy's fingers himself. It _is_ a vampire AU, after all.
-   In the A Song of Ice and Fire _The Young Wolf Victorious_, Robb manages to arrange an alliance with the Ironborn by marrying Asha Greyjoy (he managed to avert the Frey deal). In their wedding night, they have a brutal row, followed by axe-and-sword fighting, followed by frenzied coitus. Robb's left bruised and scratched up, Asha has a black eye and a scuffed chin.
-   The _It Matters_ collection of _Death Note_ fanfics (informally called the "Matti-Canon"), Matt and Mello have a marital relationship like this. It's deconstructed; they are shown to be dysfunctional individually (hence the violence), as well as codependent on one another to a fault.
    -   In fact, it's not uncommon for them in other fanworks to have a Destructive Romance of some kind, to the point of being a Fandom-Specific Plot. (Even though in the Canon manga, they're nothing if not good to one another.)
-   In _A Horse for the Force_, Echani are not only extremely skilled at reading body language but also value martial ability over almost anything else. As a result, several get turned on while watching Shaak Ti and Ranma spar, referring to it as rather heavy flirting. Several women become interested in Ranma as a result, including a member of the Death Watch.
-   Anko in _Indomitable_ spent years working solo because her mind can't tell the difference between violence and foreplay. Not only does she at times become unbearably aroused during violent missions, but she's often disturbingly violent during sex, having once put a squad into the ICU when a mission went exceptionally badly.
-   _Miraculous: Marinette's Predicament_: Angry at Marinette for kissing Nathaniel in a misunderstanding, Adrien confronts her. What follows is a particularly rough bonking session between the two (something their busy lives have prevented them from doing), undoing the tension between them, allowing them to talk to each other and settle things.
-   In _Road Trip from Hela_, Hela easily admits that she's had multiple children, all of whom came from having sex with particularly powerful enemy combatants.
-   In _Cabin Fever: Parting Shot_, a bottle-shooting contest takes place between the guys, with the grand prize on offer being a sexual ride with Marcy.
-   In _A Parable of Talents_, Izuku and Mina become increasingly turned on during their sparring. Initially, it's due to Mina fighting topless in order to desensitize Izuku to the female form so he stops freezing up every time he touches something "inappropriate". Afterwards, it's because they're two attractive teenagers and Mina's focused on teaching Izuku how to properly grapple.
-   Implied with Snow White in _So Rot Vie Blut_. She plays with her knife during sex, to the point where she even holds it to men's throats.
-   In _Anything's Possible_, Kim admits to enjoying the thrill of fighting Shego. Her description of what it's like sounds similar to sex.

    Film 

-   _Videodrome_ has a special film that causes people to hallucinate bizarre mixtures of erotic and horrifically violent content involving a woman (named "Nicki") who is seen being tortured to death in the film. For example, at Nicki's request, a man pulls a gun from a vagina-like cavity in his stomach. The gun fuses to his hand, then he makes sexual thrusting motions with the gun-hand into his stomach!
-   The point of the title creatures of _Alien_. In order to reproduce, they have to impregnate another organism, and their larvae will then murder the host trying to escape. _Alien_ (1979) also intentionally features many disturbing sexual motifs. HR Giger himself claims that _Alien_ was an attempt to personify the fear of rape.
-   _Fear Clinic_: Caylee's self-loathing has her try to get Dylan to choke her some while they're having sex. He gets rattled by this and stops.
-   _James Bond_:
    -   The Sean Connery era features this heavily.
    -   The Pierce Brosnan Bond movies also include these on at least two occasions. In _GoldenEye_, we have Xenia Onatopp and Bond involved in a physical struggle at the sauna of his hotel. She tries to crush him to death with her Murderous Thighs, but there are signs that both are clearly enjoying the moment; Onatopp revels in it so much that her toes visibly curl and she unleashes loud screams.
        
        **Onatopp**: You don't need the gun... Commander.  
        **Bond**: That depends on your definition of "safe sex."
        
        -   And once 007 wins the fight, he counters Xenia's previous cries of "Yes! Yes! Yes!" with:
            
            **Bond**: No, no, no. No more foreplay.
            
        -   Even before Bond meets her, we see her very obviously get off shooting up a room full of people. Even General Ourumov gave pause witnessing it.
    -   The second example occurs in _The World Is Not Enough_, where Bond is being tortured by Elektra King during the penultimate confrontation. She indulges in kissing and taunting her former lover as she gradually breaks his neck. She then straddles his lap and asks sensually:
        
        **Elektra**: Do you know what happens when a man is strangled?
        
        -   Just when it seems like she is about to kill him by turning the wheel of the torture chair, he quips:
-   Basically the entirety of _Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)_, which revolves around the relationship issues of a married couple who kill people for a living.
-   In _Shoot 'Em Up_, Smith continues to have sex with Donna while gunning down the Mooks sent to kill him. Donna certainly seems to enjoy the experience, while Smith quips, "Talk about shooting your load!"
-   Sex and death are always closely related themes in the films of Alfred Hitchcock. It's probably most obvious in _Rope_, where the first line of dialogue (after our Villain Protagonists have just murdered a classmate) is "Don't open the curtains. Let's... stay like this for a while." Promptly followed by the lighting of cigarettes after they conceal the corpse.
-   A scene in _Empire of the Sun_ had a couple quietly making love whilst the bombs went on outside the camp.
-   _The Man Who Fell to Earth_ has a very graphic sex scene in which the two shoot blanks at each other from a revolver during intercourse.
-   _Otto; or Up with Dead People_, which is a gay zombie film with what appears to be unsimulated sex scenes. Particularly near the end when there is a (fake) zombie orgy.
-   It's more an interplay of sex and surgery, but the, er, climactic scene of _Repo Men_ definitely counts.
-   The interlude in "Zydrate Anatomy" in _Repo! The Genetic Opera_ features an interplay of sex and surgery.
-   Arguably, the entire _Hellraiser_ series of films. At least, insofar as Pinhead's description of things to come for the protagonists.

-   _Hostage_ (1993). Sam Neill plays a British intelligence officer—in one scene he stabs a female guerrilla. As she gasps when the knife goes in, there's an instant flashback to him having sex with another woman earlier.
-   Yukio Mishima's _Patriotism_ **is** this trope, being the exquisitely filmed story of a young army officer and his wife who have sex and then kill themselves.
-   _Big Tits Zombie_ is half T&A and half zombie mutilation... but all funny.
-   Lampshaded big-time in _Demolition Man_, with elements of Do You Want to Copulate? added. Even funnier when we discover that Huxley and Spartan have two completely different understandings of the word "sex."
    
    **Lenina Huxley**: John Spartan, there is, of course, a well-known and documented connection between sex and violence. Not so much a causal effect as a general state of neurological arousal. And after having observed your behavior this evening and my resultant condition, um, I was wondering if you'd like to have sex?
    
-   _A Clockwork Orange_: Played with. The violence and rape are played out among images of nudity. You know the bit in the book where Alex beats the woman to death? He uses a plaster penis as the weapon in the movie.
-   For the most part, the violence in _Munich_ is presented very bluntly and not at all artistically. There is, however, a sex scene juxtaposed with scenes of violence.
-   In _Seed of Chucky_, Chucky and Tiffany bring the spark back into their love life when they decapitate a prop guy with a piece of wire.
-   _Sucker Punch_ is entirely about violence (the fantasy action sequences) as a metaphor for sex (working in the brothel), and sex (Babydoll about to be deflowered in the brothel) as a metaphor for violence (Babydoll about to be lobotomized in the asylum).
-   In _Wild Things_, about halfway through Suzie and Kelly have a physical fight in which Kelly almost drowns Suzie. It ends with them making out in the pool.
-   _American Me_: Santana's first time with a woman after he's released from prison is intercut with a brutal gang rape perpetrated on his orders against a rival mafioso's son in prison.
-   _Dallas Buyers Club_ opens on the main character having a threesome while watching a man get gored to death in a bullfight.
-   Definitely at work in _Killer's Kiss_. Vincent gets turned on by watching Davey the boxer take a beatdown on TV, so he starts pawing at Gloria.
-   _The Devil's Rejects_: Otis Firefly is seen laying in bed with a dead cheerleader at one point. Later, the Firefly family has two couples hostage at gunpoint. Otis makes sexual comments about his sister and orders the hostage Gloria to strip to her underwear. She does so to which Baby comments appreciatively ("She's got a tight little ass on her!") and Otis sticks his gun in her bra revealing her chest and into her underwear and Baby smacks her on the butt as they threaten her and her companions with death. Later, Otis says his gun smells like Gloria's vagina and he makes comments about threatening to rape Gloria to her husband before killing him.
-   In _Bring Me the Head of the Machine Gun Woman_, Santiago threatens the Machine Gun Woman with a replica pistol. She responds by performing fellatio on the gun barrel.
-   _Dobermann_: Dobermann plays head games with the armoured car guard by asking him if he wants to sleep with Nat. As he is doing this, Nat salaciously licks the barrel of her shotgun.
-   _Boss Level_: After the hero has used the Ground Hog Day Loop to become a Master Swordsman, he toys with a swordswoman trying to kill him by Cherry Tapping her throughout their fight in flirtatious ways. He strokes her cheek during one exchange of blows. In the end, he dips her as if for a kiss but impales her with his sword instead.
-   _Underground_: As immortalized on the movie poster, the film's iconic scene features a beautiful blond woman dancing rapturously on top of a tank and hanging off of the gun barrel suggestively.
-   _Kiss of the Damned_: Djuna is having sex with Paolo when she bites him, which turns him into a vampire as well.
-   _The Incredibles_: Downplayed—largely because it's a family movie—with Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl. When the whole Parr family is fighting Syndrome's Mooks on Nomanisan Island, Bob and Helen effortlessly blow up a few of their crafts. As the massive explosion flares behind them, they look at each other and sigh "I _love_ you" in a decidedly romantic way, suggesting that they're turned on by the violence that comes with battling villains.
-   In _Pathology_, Juliette is turned on by murder and frequently has sex immediately after killing someone. She also enjoys rough sex and does such acts as cutting her tongue with a scalpel immediately before kissing Ted. Jake is also shown to like violent sex, including having Juliette stick acupuncture needles in his chest and rake her hand over them while they are screwing.

    Literature 

-   _Black Iris_: Laney compares Armin stopping her No-Holds-Barred Beatdown on Zoeller to being interrupted while masturbating. Later, she observes the results of her work "rapturously".
-   In the backstory of _A Brother's Price_ Keifer liked hurting his wives during sex. It's one of the reasons why no one is sad he's dead.
-   _The Acts of Caine_ looks at this a lot, perhaps best personified by Count Berne.
-   _Hyperion Cantos_:
    -   Kassad and Moneta slaughter a group of soldiers while the readers are treated to a description of just how much they're both turned on. Then they have sex on top of the bodies. In fact, their entire relationship is like this.
    -   The Shrike, a being made entirely of sharpened blades, appears and brutally attacks during two different sex scenes.
-   The _Doctor Who_ Eighth Doctor Adventures novel _EarthWorld_:
    
    Your body is so beautiful. I am going to run my hands over your smooth pale skin, softly, so softly, so you shiver at my every touch. Your body will be mine and I will hurt it, beautifully, you will feel every caress of pain. I will hurt you and hurt you, and when you think there is no pain left I will hurt you again. I will take you far away, to pain you could never dream of. And then you will bleed for me, a trickle, a torrent, a stream, until the last drop of your life falls to the floor and I can taste it. And I will, finally, feel whole and fulfilled, through you
    
    -   The above quote is coming, basically, from a thirteen-year-old girl, and is apparently directed at the Doctor, who's a thousand-year-old Chaste Hero who looks like a handsome forty-year-old man. _And_ his companion, who has no intention whatsoever of ever either hurting him or boinking him, is being made to say it. Basically, it's just gross.
-   Vampires in _Dora Wilk Series_ live this trope, coming from one to another in the blink of an (human) eye.

-   In the _Outlander_ series, the Depraved Bisexual Captain John Randall is _very_ much into this. He's shown to be incapable of getting hard unless he's beating or torturing the person he's raping.
-   The dark fey court in _Wicked Lovely_. Particular mention goes to how Niall's rape/torture was largely treated as 'entertainment' by all except Irial (and Niall himself) and the whole 'shadow girl' thing. Melissa Marr has described it as both 'the court of temptation' and 'a place of cruelty'. Leslie describes Irial, their former king, as "Every horrible thing she shouldn't miss, every nightmare she shouldn't crave." Yeah, they're made of this trope.
-   In the _Parrish Plessis_ series, the Eskaalim parasites feed on both sex and violence. Parrish, in an attempt to prevent her Eskaalim from driving her Ax-Crazy, learns to substitute sex when it tries to drive her to violence. This ends up backfiring, as the Eskaalim gets fed either way; her efforts merely end up teaching it that she is less averse to sex than to violence, allowing it to get better at manipulating her.
-   In _IT_ Patrick suffocates his baby brother and is described as being turned on while doing it.
-   In the short story "The Screwfly Solution" by James Tiptree Jr., aliens exploit the connection between sexual arousal and violence. A chemical agent is spread over the earth that causes men to become insanely, homicidally violent when aroused. It doesn't end well (for us).
-   In the _Hurog_ series, many of the villains are also (implied to be) sexual sadists. Most of this happens offscreen and/or is only hinted at, but the characters often lampshade it, or flat-out state that someone is known to be turned on by violence.
-   In _Nikki Heat: Heat Wave_, Nikki has a casual relationship with her hand-to-hand combat instructor, a retired SEAL. Sometimes they even sleep together _without_ beating each other up first.
-   Notably averted in the punishments of the lustful, the sodomites, and the pimps in _The Divine Comedy_. All of these punished for sexual sins do not suffer sexually charged tortures universally employed in other depictions of Hell from the time of medieval tapestries to video games by Electronic Arts.
-   _Beautiful Losers_ juxtaposes the constant, kinky sex going on in the 1960s plot with the extreme self-mortification and chastity of the 17th century, setting them in opposition to each other. The virginal Katherine Tekakwitha who engages in the most violence against herself, and at one point her friend Marie-Therese, a widow, is able to regain her virginity after extensive self-mortification. However, F. queers this binary, as his goal seems to be to introduce both more sex and more violence into the world.
-   In _Jago_, the antagonist has a powerful psychic ability that influences how people around him experience the world, and some serious hang-ups around sex due to his upbringing. Nearly all the sexual moments in the novel involve violent elements, and quite a lot of the violent moments involve sexual elements.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Angel_: In "Waiting in the Wings" Angel and Cordelia are Kissing Under the Influence and are about to have sex when masked lackeys burst in on them. Angel kills them simultaneously, stabbing one while killing the other with a dagger thrown Offhand Backhand. Cordelia says they need to get out of there right away as "You looked _really_ hot doing that."
-   _Batwoman (2019)_: In "Drink Me", the Villain of the Week Nocturna has a vampire motif—biting her victims with fangs and draining their blood. In fighting Batwoman she's so obviously turned on that Batwoman has to inform her You're Not My Type as she does _not_ find murder sexy.
-   Crosses with Hemo Erotic in _Being Human_; Mitchell admits that with his kind, sex and violent death end up being rather difficult to disentangle.
-   _A Bit of Fry and Laurie_ has a section where the pair apologise to the audience because Moral Guardians banned them from performing a sketch involving sex and violence:
    
    **Stephen:** Lots of sex. Lots of violence.
    
    **Hugh:** During the course of the sketch, Stephen hits me several times with a golf club.
    
    **Stephen:** Which in the ordinary course of events wouldn't matter except that I do it very sexily.
    
    **Hugh:** This is it, you see. He does it so, _soo_ sexily. I just wish you could see it, I really do.
    
    **Hugh:** ...violently.
    
    **Stephen:** Very, _very_ violently. Now this raises problems.
    
    **Hugh:** Not for me!
    
-   In an episode of _Blake's 7_, Avon is having a life-and-death struggle with a female Villain of the Week, including her hitting him in the groin. When he finally subdues her, he says to the other men present, "You better get her out of here, I really rather enjoyed that."
-   A fourth season episode of _Bones_ opens with the gang watching Booth playing hockey and beating the crap out of some guys on the ice (he's the team's enforcer). Cam says she likes it... a little too much. Then she has a Did I Say That Out Loud moment.
-   _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_: Rosa Diaz and Adrian Pimento have an intense relationship based on pure lust which develops into love. They're attracted to each other right from the start with understated aggression. Once they get together, their sex talk is very graphic and violent, their making out sessions are very physical, Rosa occasionally slaps Pimento before kissing him and when they break up, each returns to the other their blood (Rosa wore a small vial around her neck while Pimento had a plastic zip bag, taken without Rosa's knowledge).
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ played with the "violence turns the Slayers on" trope a couple of times. Faith basically embodied it, but Buffy is shown to be Not So Above It All. Her tender love scene with Riley is intercut with the two of them fighting a demon, which is revealed to have taken place just beforehand. And then there was Buffy's entire relationship with Spike—most notably in the final scene of "Smashed". Spike himself fantasizes about fighting the Slayer while having sex with Harmony in "Family".
-   Fiona, Michael Westen's trigger-happy Heroic Comedic Sociopath ex-girlfriend in _Burn Notice_.
    
    **Michael**: "Violence may be foreplay for you, Fi. Not for me."
    
-   The first episode of _Caprica_ contrasted scenes of a couple having sex to a violent mafia assassination.
-   In one episode of _Criminal Minds_, the UnSubs are a young couple who travel around the country going to convenience stores and alcohol support programs. They then shoot everyone present until they know they're all dead, grab some nearby booze, and return to have sex in their car. This keeps going until they return to the guy's house. The girl then shoots the guy's father, which causes their relationship to start faltering, ultimately resulting in both of them dying.
-   _CSI_ had an episode open with intercutting scenes of someone being brutally murdered and Catherine having mad passionate sex with Vartann.
-   _Daredevil (2015)_: Matt's college relationship with Elektra revolved around petty crimes and fighting as sexual foreplay.
-   One memorably intense scene in the first season of _Desperate Housewives_ intercuts Susan and Mike's passionate first-time foreplay with Paul Young strangling Martha Huber to death.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   River Song's sexuality is based around this. She literally uses sex as a weapon, once murdering the Doctor by kissing him with poison lipstick.
    -   For a more benign example, Idris in "The Doctor's Wife" enjoys biting people because "it's like kissing, only there's a winner!"
-   _Fellow Travelers_: In the third episode, a lover's spat between Hawkins Fuller and Timothy Laughlin directly fuels the heated make-up sex which immediately follows. The mild BDSM aspects of their relationship are heightened slightly in this particular sexual encounter. Tim initiates foreplay by requesting that Hawk slap him twice, to which the latter complies. After commanding Tim to strip off his clothing, Hawk ties his boyfriend's hands and then shoves him down on to the bed. Hawk sodomizes Tim without _any_ preparation, so the latter yelps in pain, but Tim remains an eager sub because he obeys his dom's order to repeatedly proclaim that he's Hawk's Property of Love with "I belong to Hawkins Fuller."
-   The final filmed episode of _Firefly_ has the crew transporting the supposedly dead body of one of Zoe and Mal's former squad mate. Jayne and Book end up talking about how everyone on the ship seems to act differently around the body, with Jayne admitting that seeing/being near a dead body makes him need to do something, work out, kill someone, get some tail (although he is quick to point out it's not because death makes him randy). And Book telling him it's a completely natural feeling, that the reminder of mortality simply makes him want to experience life while he can. And then there's River, who straddles the coffin and rubs herself against it.
-   _Forever Knight_: In the final episode, Nick finally agrees to give Natalie the Kiss of the Vampire. The episode is something of a Clip Show so we then have a montage not only of Nick biting other attractive women but also of past violent scenes. Unfortunately this presages the reveal that Nick lost control of his Blood Lust and drained Natalie completely, instead of feeding on her only a bit as he promised.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   In a deleted scene from season 2, Doreah, an ex-prostitute, strangles Irri to death while giving her a lecture on Erotic Asphyxiation.
    -   And then there's Margaery setting up for Joffrey to show her how to use a crossbow, interesting him as much from a (deliberate) subtle sign of bloodlust as from the close contact.
-   _The Honourable Woman_: Ephra and Atika's having sex in interspersed with scenes of the buildup to the bomb going off in episode seven. The blast itself coincides with Atika's orgasm.
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_:
    -   "In Throes of Increasing Wonder...": Lestat de Lioncourt has sex with Louis de Pointe du Lac while also drinking his blood with his fangs pierced into his lover's neck.
    -   "Like Angels Put in Hell by God": Louis barges into Antoinette Brown's house, interrupting her and Lestat in the midst of sexual intercourse. Louis argues with Lestat, pushes his naked boyfriend to the floor, shoves him against the dresser (Lestat's expression shows that he's aroused being manhandled by Louis in this fashion), kisses him, grinds their hips together to initiate frottage, stabs Lestat on his left side with his vampire fingernails, and bites his neck. While eagerly embracing Louis, Lestat is grunting in pain _and_ pleasure as the camera pans away. In the next scene, Lestat's face, neck, left ear and right arm are covered with scratches, bruises and bite marks — it's evident that he and Louis had rough, angry sex.
-   _Leverage_:
    -   Elliot Spencer's fight with Mikel Dayan in "The Two Live Crew Job" episode ends with them kissing.
    -   In a different episode, Eliot begins to pound on the team's mortal enemy Sterling in a bar. What does Parker do? Stands there with a smile on her face. It was _intended_ to be Parker enjoying watching Sterling get his comeuppance, but Beth Riesgraf's smile was a little too gleeful (she's almost licking her chops.)
-   In one episode of _Life on Mars (2006)_, Gene Hunt and Sam Tyler engage in a fistfight. It culminates in the two sitting rather post-coitally with Gene smoking a cigarette.
-   _Orange Is the New Black_: Alex and Piper's lesbian relationship is described as "psychotic" and is comprised of Piper manipulating Alex and being involved with getting her sent back to prison because she wanted them to be miserable together. When Piper confesses the truth to Alex she insults her and proceeds to have hate sex with Piper after Alex slaps her.
-   _Oz_:
    -   There's the Keller/Beecher relationship, conjugal visits in the first season, and transvestites strutting their stuff. Not to mention all the sexual slavery that goes on.
    -   Lee Tergesen and Christopher Meloni won GLAAD (Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) awards for their troubles. Did GLAAD actually watch the show?
    -   Jefferson Keane's execution also counts, what with the actual execution part interlaced with scenes of McManus and Wittlesey getting it on in the prison.
-   _The Punisher (2017)_: In "Flustercluck", Billy Russo having sadomasochistic sex with his therapist is intercut with Russo's paramilitary gang robbing drug dens and killing everyone in them.
-   The death of Marian in the second season finale of _Robin Hood_ was described by the writers as "the consummation of Guy and Marian". The scene in question has her running up to him, declaring her love for another man, and then getting impaled in the lower abdomen. Guy draws her toward him, she throws her head back and then slides down his body as a fountain in the background spurts water from his direction toward her.
-   _Sex Education_: Eric and his bully Adam are thrown in detention together. Adam keeps annoying Eric and then they start fighting. As Adam holds Eric down, Eric yells at him to get off him, and then desperately spits at Adam's face. He immediately says sorry but Adam spits back. Their physical fight turns into kissing and then Adam gives Eric a blowjob. However, Adam threatens Eric to not tell anyone, but later initiates subtle touches when they're in class.
-   The first episode of _Spartacus: Gods Of The Arena_ features a montage cutting back and forth between Gannicus having sex with two women and the other gladiators outside sparring. Then later in the same episode, Gaia and Lucretia's drug-fueled girl-on-girl action is intercut with Batiatus receiving a No-Holds-Barred Beatdown from a rival.
    -   Indeed, Spartacus is built heavily on this trope. Many scenes are intercut with sex and violence, with plenty of both littering the series. You could be forgiven for thinking this is Interplay of Sex and Violence: The Series.
-   _Spooks_ season seven: Lucas North has a brutal fight with a guy in a Moscow bar, which ends with him drowning the guy in the sink. During this fight, shots of a pole dancer upstairs appear frequently).
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: Worf explains Klingon mating rituals.
    -   Which perfectly leads to _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ and Worf finally only understanding that Jadzia's been coming onto him for an entire episode after challenging him to a bat'leth fight. (The two then end up one of the series' official couples.)
-   In _Stranger Things_, Nancy having sex with Steve is intercut with Barb being killed by the Demogorgon, emphasized particularly when Nancy and Steve hold hands, and then Barb's hand is desperately clinging to a ladder to avoid being pulled away.
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   Most female demons, especially Ruby, Meg, and Dental Hygienist!Lilith, love macking on the boys while smacking them around.
    -   In "The Slice Girls", Dean has sex with a Girl of the Week which is intercut with a brutal murder. Turns out the two are related as the woman Dean picked up is an Amazon, who after being impregnated by a man has them killed as a Rite of Passage for the child.
-   The scene in _Torchwood_ where Jack and John Hart suck face and then, practically without pausing for breath, proceed to beat the hell out of each other.
-   _True Blood_: In "It Hurts Me Too" after Bill pins Lorena against a wall and tells her that he'll never love her, she kisses him. He does not react well to this, first going for her throat with his fangs, then responding to her urging him to make love to her by doing so extremely violently to the point that he leaves several cuts on her chest and twists her head around 180 degrees. Lorena loves every second of it, and dreamily says "Oh William, I so love you."
-   King Henry had six beautiful wives as portrayed on _The Tudors_, but it was Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard who were portrayed as the most sexualized, with plenty of nude and sex scenes. These are the two wives who are eventually beheaded. In fact, Katherine Howard goes so far as to practice putting her head on the block in the nude. Perfectly demonstrated: here. Catherine did that in real life too — the practicing part, although presumably she was clothed.
-   In _Vikings_, Lagertha attacks Ragnar to get him to take her with him to raid England. He tries to turn it into foreplay.

    Music 

-   The Beatles: The song "Happiness Is A Warm Gun" on _The White Album_ has Lennon singing about holding a gun in a tongue-in-cheek erotic manner: "When I feel my finger on your trigger/I feel nobody can do me no harm".
-   Some early Visual Kei works. It spun off into the _entire_ Visual Kei subgenre of Eroguro Kei, featuring bands such as Dir en grey and The Gazette, In fact, to some Moral Guardians with no knowledge of the variance within Visual Kei, or to others who see the most popular and well-known bands as representing the entire scene, Visual Kei _is_ Eroguro Kei—which poses problems for artists who prefer lighter and more positive themes such as the Lolita Kei and Oshare Kei subgenres in trying to find/appeal to audiences (because the sort of fans looking for Eroguro generally do not like them, and if Moral Guardians have been outraged by something an Eroguro band has done, the backlash is likely to hit the cleaner, softer bands just as hard)
-   The music video for Lady Gaga's song "Alejandro". Lady Gaga in general, via her music and their corresponding videos. Some examples are "Bad Romance", "Monster", "I Like it Rough" (though that might be taking it a bit literal), "Teeth" etc.

-   The Magnetic Fields' song "Heather Heather":
    
    _"Heather Heather  
    We belong together  
    Like sex and violence  
    Like death and silence."_
    
-   In Jay-Z's "Meet The Parents" he describes Mike and Isis:
    
    _"Hangin out the window when she first seen him fight  
    She was so turned on that she had to shower twice."_
    

-   The animated music video for Caravan Palace's Lone Digger take place at the strip club where a bloody fight ensues, and the stripper continues to dance with blood splashing all over her body.
-   Ninja Sex Party's "Party of Three" is a serenade Danny writes for his hot date as they go through an astoundingly romantic night, all while Ninja Brian murders everyone in their vicinity.
    
    _"Do you see what I mean?  
    Nothing's more romantic than a murder in the second degree!"_
    
-   Roy Brown's "Butcher Pete" initially sounds like it's about a crazed Serial Killer with a fondness for butchering women, but as the song goes on and Pete amasses a swarm of female fans it begins to sound like Pete could either be a Serial Killer or a Lovable Sex Maniac being described in violent Double Entendres.
-   In The Divine Comedy's "Charge", it's difficult to tell where the war metaphors end and the sex metaphors begin.
    
    _"They'll go BANG BANG BANG all night..."_
    
-   The Exploit's song "Sex and Violence", whose lyrics consist almost entirely of the words "Sex and Violence" repeated over and over.

    Mythology 

-   In Celtic Mythology, the Morrigan is the goddess of both fertility and war. Sex and death.
-   Astarte of Phoenician, Syrian, Canaanite and later Egyptian Mythology is a goddess of fertility and war, parallel to Ishtar. She may be Anat (though she might also be her sister, at least according to Egyptians) who is an ancient Semitic goddess, for whom it is said that calling her violent "is like calling a tsunami wet". She is a goddess with dominion over love, sex, war, battle, fertility, maternity, and death — to the point where it's said she _killed_ death for crossing her. Despite that, she's said to be a benevolent goddess, if an easily enraged one.
-   Classical Mythology:
    -   _Intercourse_ of sex and violence, what with the god of war Ares always running off and having affairs with the goddess of love Aphrodite.
    -   Eros, the God of Love. Ancient Greek soldiers would pray to him before going into battle; sex and violence were understood to be two sides of the same coin.
        
        **A seer**: _(describing Eros to his fiancée)_ ...\[he's\] a monster whom neither gods nor men can resist...
        
-   Mesopotamian Mythology: Inanna/Ishtar is a Sumerian/Babylonian Goddess of love, fertility, and war.
-   The Voodoo god of death is also the god of sexuality... in addition to being a great healer. If he decides not to dig someone's grave, they'll recover... instead of simply not actually dying.
-   Freyja is a goddess of love and sex, who had more than her share of martial aspects. In fact, she received half of the battle-dead not claimed by Odin. By some accounts, she gets first pick of the slain, and Odin gets the half she didn't claim.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Warhammer_ and _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   The Chaos God Slaanesh. Pain and pleasure, love and hate, beauty and suffering, all in one easy mindfucking package. Its followers are Sense Freaks and Too Kinky to Torture to the utter screaming extreme, considering any experience, win or lose, to be one to savour, regardless if said experience is, say, evisceration with a chain-axe or immolation with futuristic napalm. It's all good.
        -   This also applies to the Dark Eldar/Elves who are strongly fueling the monster their ancestors created via hedonism! One has to wonder if the Knife-Eared Gnats are aware of hir becoming the new Chieftain of their former pantheon?
    -   Slaanesh's opposite is Khorne, the Blood God, who is a War God to the extreme. They and their followers actually hate each other and will gladly screw each other over (not... literally) or interrupt their war on Imperials just to harm the other.
-   All over the _World of Darkness_ games, especially Werewolf and Vampire, and _especially_ in the art direction.
    -   In the case of _Vampire: The Masquerade/Requiem_, becoming a Kindred replaces the desire for sex with the desire for blood. Drinking blood from a victim, whether it's a willing participant or an enemy the Kindred is fighting, is described as orgasmic for both parties.

    Theatre 

-   The musical _Les Misérables_ has the song "Red and Black". It connects Enjolras' hopes for revolution with Marius' love of Cosette. Lampshaded in the intro to the song with Grantaire's "You talk of battles to be won / and here he comes like Don Juan. / It's better than an opera!"
    
    **Enjolras**: _Red!_  
    **Marius**: I feel my soul on fire!  
    **Grantaire**: _Black!_  
    **Marius**: My world if she's not there!  
    **Ensemble**: _Red!_  
    **Marius**: The color of desire!  
    **Ensemble**: _Black!_  
    **Marius**: The color of despair!
    
-   Artistic portrayals of _Othello_ often indulge in this trope, with Desdemona suffocated by her jealous husband Othello in their bed. This ballet adaptation advertisement<small>◊</small> features a rather interesting composition. The TV Tropes work page of _Othello_ includes a painting by Alexandre-Marie Colin, which portrays murdered Desdemona as Drop Dead Gorgeous.
-   Stanley and Stella's entire relationship in _A Streetcar Named Desire_. He's often violent and violent with her especially, yet he's not called on his domestic abuse of his wife. Quite the opposite: she's sexually drawn to him on an "animal-instincts" level.
-   _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_ could be referred to as "Interplay Of Sex And Violence: The Musical". This was especially drawn on in the 2012 production with Michael Ball and Imelda Staunton; as she opens the trunk to discover Pirelli's body, Mrs. Lovett emits a series of increasingly _titillated_ groans. Mrs. Lovett and Mr. Todd are in business together which includes murdering people and she would _love_ to romance him and get married.

    Video Games 

-   One of Noh's endings in the first _Samurai Warriors_ games begins with her apparently trying to murder her husband Oda Nobunaga... then, while still straddling him, she throws the knife away and gives him a passionate kiss instead. Her storyline in the third Xtreme Legends version takes this to another level. She seems to be split between a twin desire to either kill or schtupp him.
-   Alma's relationship with Becket shows definite signs of this in _Project Origin_, as all of their encounters involve at least one trying to kill the other at the same time.
-   In _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_, Travis' ecstasy meter is filled up by butchering mooks and finding porn magazines.
-   Leona in _The King of Fighters_' Orochi Saga seems to enjoy herself _quite_ a bit while beating the tar out of her opponent while in Blood Riot mode—including a Skyward Scream which many players pointed out didn't sound... quite like a scream of rage.
    -   In _KOF XIII_, Shen Woo shamelessly admits that he's into this when he fights either Mature or Vice.
-   One of the Tsviets in _Dirge of Cerberus_, Rosso, seems to apply to this trope. She gets pleasure from killing, calls Vincent 'darling' during their fights, sweetly apologises after injuring him and gets downright frustrated when she can't finish him off.
-   Juri in _Super Street Fighter IV_ only seems to find enjoyment in fighting, complete with licking her lips when she's about to do something particularly nasty to the other character.
-   Cleopatra VII in _Dante's Inferno_ is a gigantic succubus who fights Dante at the top of the penis-shaped Tower of Lust, along with her champion/consort Mark Antony, and after Dante kills Antony, she tries to seduce Dante herself. If he falls for it, a Non Standard Game Over occurs. If he resists and stabs her instead, she moans like he's... penetrating her in some other way.

-   _BlazBlue_ features Nu-13, a clone of the main character Ragna's sister who's been programmed to want to both kill him and be killed by him. This combination of 'sisterly love' and 'murder-suicide brainwashing' means that half of her dialogue is double entendres that could be taken as "I want you to stab me" or "I want you to \*ahem\* 'Stab Me'."

-   Jane, one of the soldiers in the RPG _Valkyria Chronicles_, clearly enjoys killing Imperial units a bit too much.
    
    **Jane:** Mmmm... scream for me.
    
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   It's implied in _Mass Effect 3_'s Citadel DLC that a Shepard romancing Kaidan is, to an extent, aroused by violence.
        
        **Shepard:** I was watching you fight back in the skycar lot. It was... pretty hot.
        
    -   A romanced Garrus admits that a significant chunk of his initial attraction to Shepard is based on his respect for her combat and leadership prowess. In addition, the initial start of the romantic relationship is kickstarted by his account of a sparring match that ended in a draw between him and a female crew member when he was in the turian military, followed by a tie-breaker in her quarters. Shepard then comes on to him by suggesting first that they try sparring, and then saying they should "skip to the tie-breaker".
-   _Haunting Ground_: If Fiona is killed by Daniella's impalement attack, the player is treated to a game over screen filled with the sounds of Laughing Mad, Immodest Orgasm, and the cutting of flesh, because this is just that type of game.
-   This is one interpretation of the effect of Brongaa's blood on Gulcasa and Emilia in _Blaze Union_; when Emilia goes insane in the B route, quite a bit of Accidental Innuendo and Orgasmic Combat ensues; after having to kill a soldier with Genocide or die himself, Gulcasa's state has been compared both to a drug high and immediately post-orgasmic afterglow, and he is shown as unable to think straight and describes the sensation as feverish and pleasurable. This is played as rather disturbing with Emilia in particular, as she's eleven years old.
-   _Metal Gear_:
    -   This is the basic point of _Metal Gear Solid_, which mixes violence with sexual imagery about as much as it can while remaining relatively subtle, although it mostly eases off after that when Snake gains control of his squicky fetishes.
    -   Comes back in full force in _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_, though, perhaps to underline his sexual frustration.
    -   There's the fight between Vamp and Raiden in _MGS4_, which has some extremely, though somewhat disturbing homoerotic imagery: the grappling, the almost rutting-like motion when Raiden stabs himself to nail Vamp — and don't forget the white blood and the crotch-knife licking.
-   _Manhunt_. In a game about snuff porn, it's kind of to be expected.
-   _Tsukihime_. The scene where Shiki first sees Arcueid in the street and stalks her home. The ambiguity of what he's stalking her home to do is stretched as far as possible before he finally kills her. There are also a few scenes that follow a serial killer and note he apparently gets off sexually whenever he claims a new victim.
-   A very disturbing example in _Far Cry 3_.
    -   And in the bad ending, Citra stabs Jason to death after having sex with him and wagering that she's now pregnant with his child.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series, the Morag Tong is a legal (at least within Morrowind) assassin's guild sanctioned by the Dunmeri government who operate in service to Mephala, a Daedric Prince associated with manipulation, murder, betrayal, and sex. As devout followers of Mephala, members of the Morag Tong are encouraged to mix sex, betrayal, and murder together. This makes them excellent Femme Fatale and LadyKiller assassins.
-   The infamous "You're thinking about how much you want to ＊＊＊＊ 2B, aren't you?" line from _NieR: Automata_. Aside from the obvious takeaway, Adam's Hannibal Lecture to 9S before he speaks that line gives the impression that it could also mean that 9S wants to _kill_ 2B.
-   In _Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia_, there's Battle Couple Clive and Mathilda. Their Support conversations don't even try to hide the fact that he worships her as a Valkyrie and he gets aroused seeing her fight in battle, and on her part, she is immensely pleased to slay their enemies in his name to please him.
-   Mobile phone game _Call Me A Legend_ calls itself a "Game of Battle & Love" where you both engage in bloody warfare in a Zombie Apocalypse and steamy love affairs with women (it's tamer then what the ads say).
-   In the good ending of _Prince of Persia: Warrior Within_, the Prince initiating sex with Kaileena is intercut with an army sacking his home city Babylon.
-   _League of Legends_ has Evelynn, Agony's Embrace, a succubus-like demon that greatly plays around with this idea. Demons in the game's universe feast on specific emotions which are a required avenue to target certain prey, so for Evelynn — whose target emotion is agony — she puts on a facade of a promiscuous, barely-clothed human to invoke feelings of lust, which she will swiftly convert into fatal masochism should anyone fall for the trap. Note that in no point does she ever have sex; she's only into the more visceral stuff.
-   _Dead Rising 3_: The boss Hilde Schmittendorf dresses in a Stripperific outfit and constantly spouts innuendos. At the end of her boss battle, the main character lands on top of her in a missionary position, his face cushioned by her breasts. She grabs hold of him, orgasmically gasps, "No fair! I finished first!" and dies.
    -   Dylan, the Psychopath representing Lust, is all about this, complete with an extremely Phallic Weapon.
-   Let's just say Bichiko, the Ms. Fanservice of _Shing!_, get's very excited during combat, if her cries of _"Oh baby!"_ whenever she successfully blocks an attack are any clue.
-   _Yakuza 0_ Has Homare Nishitani, who is a dyed-in-the-wool Combat Sadomasochist in the most literal sense. His eagerness to fight Majima is almost lustful, and his combination of bluntly graphic commentary and depraved glee comes across strongly as a homoerotic violence fetishist getting his thrills.
    
    **Nishitani:** "Gotta respect your policy<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Majima-kun. But I also gotta fight you. I've got a real blood chub comin' on!"
    
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_: Ethel and Cammuravi were known for getting in massive fights that _dripped_ with romantic tension, betting their Colonies on the outcome. When Cammuravi's Ferronis failed due to a mechanical defect, Ethel spared him—which, considering they're in the middle of a Forever War where seeing the enemy as anything but a monster is unthinkable, got her entire Colony demoted. It's to the point that when they are forced to fight together against Ouroboros, they instead turn on each other, ignoring orders and happily dying in each other's arms. This is all justified by the fact that, due to the influence of the Flame Clocks, none of the soldiers have any concept of romance or sexual attraction; it's pretty clear that in a sane world, these two would be engaging in some Destructo-Nookie, but they don't know how to express their feelings for each other in any way besides fighting.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Steins;Gate_, Okabe's fight with Moeka plays out like attempted rape, and he is the good guy!
-   _Monster Prom_: The FIGHT ending. Damien gets so pissed at the player they have a huge brawl at Prom Night. The fight, however, turns both of them on enough to suddenly turn into a make out and then rough sex in the bathroom, which even causes the player to break their ribs.
-   _Fate/stay night_: Gilgamesh and Saber. Well, from Gilgamesh's POV. Saber just wants to kill the bastard.
-   _Togainu no Chi_:
    -   One of the endings has Keisuke ripping out Akira's guts while proclaiming that he loves Akira. He's also sporting a look that seems similar to an orgasm.
    -   Takeru kissing Akira during their fight and the two Punishers' Bad End, especially the one involving Gunji, where he slashes and rapes Akira as he bleeds to death.
-   This is a major theme in just about _every_ conflict in _Heaven Will Be Mine_. Fighting and flirting frequently go hand in hand for the protagonists, but this is especially apparent with Saturn, who explicitly conflates the two on several occasions. It helps that the use of ship-selves means that no one ever actually dies in a fight in space, meaning the pilots are free to wail on each other to their heart's content.
-   _Wicked Lawless Love_: In Cecelia's episode 11 heart scene, she and the heroine have a sexually charged sparring session. The heroine manages to get her at knifepoint while dipping her in an embrace, and Cecelia blushes with the heroine's blade at her throat.

    Webcomics 

-   K'seliss from _Goblins_ has stated that in Lizard Folk culture, fighting, eating and mating are considered different forms of the same thing. In one scene he expresses disgust over fighting a swarm of metal monsters because they're inedible and fighting them would be a sexual perversion, and he also considers eating the fingers and limbs of potential mating partners to be an acceptable display of affection.
-   _Gunnerkrigg Court_: It's strongly implied that there's "something going on" between Eglamore and Jones. So when they have a practice spar, Jones' partial disrobing is rather suggestive, and one onlooker describes the match as such:
    
    **Andrew Smith:** What's going on?  
    **Parley:** Eglamore and Jones are having a quickie!  
    **Andrew Smith:** Ah. Clever.
    
-   _Homestuck_ has a little bit of this with trolls: Trolls have four different kinds of romance: platonic love, platonic hate, sexual love, and sexual hate. While it isn't stated outright, one could pretty easy that the sexual hate, in particular, could lead to a great deal of this. There's even a case of Slap-Slap-Kiss at one point.
-   _Ménage à 3_:
    -   The comic features something that originally appears to be a classic Slap-Slap-Kiss scene between Yuki and Sonya (see strip #908, July 05, 2014, borderline NSFW), but which later turns out to have been even weirder than Sonya realized...
        
        **Sonya**: Oh you're into kinkier stuff than your goodie-goodie facade lets on. _I_ had never been "fisted" before.  
        **Yuki**: Oh, _that!_ Actually, I punched you in the vagina and my hand got caught. Sorry 'bout that, I guess.
        
    -   Later, Yuki (who does have some self-control issues) gets into a relationship with Matt (who’s an adrenaline junky with masochistic tendencies), despite (or because of) Yuki’s tendency to turn violent during sex with men. It starts out essentially pragmatic, but they eventually recognize that it’s become downright romantic.
-   _Oglaf_: In "Teumessian Fox", two warrior women's sword fight quickly devolves into sex. Then one of them points out they should finish their fight, so they start it up again, but naked this time.

    Web Original 

-   _Broken Saints_ plays with this a lot. Best example: the fight scene in Mars' strip club, mostly due to Mars' compensating for something with his conspicuously long handgun. Also, Word of God states the line "When the urge comes to you again... think of me" is supposed to refer to both violent urges and sexual urges, due to their all-too-connected nature in context.
-   According to Count Jackula, one Halloween tradition on Drakulon is that its inhabitants travel in droves to the pleasure pits and "murder-fuck each other" in gladiatorial blood-sports. Being a race of vampires with regenerating powers, this is far less horrifying than it would be otherwise.
-   In _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_ Cell uses overtly sexual language when it comes to combat and treats absorption as though it were intercourse, with some disturbing rape overtones.
-   _Helluva Boss_: Moxxie and Millie's loving relationship places a lot of focus on just how much Moxxie loves Millie for being an absolute psychopath who loves to kill. The two synergize best when the opportunity to cause violence also results in the opportunity to celebrate their love for each other, which only leads to them being even better at causing violence. At one point, Moxxie even admits he finds threats of everlasting torture "kinda hot." Case in point: in "C.H.E.R.U.B", the two start aggressively making out _in the middle of a shootout_. Clothes were flung.
-   In _The Gamer's Alliance_, the succubi of the Eastern Horde are all about combining pain and pleasure into the ultimate experience through combat and sex.
-   _Zero Punctuation_: Yahtzee lampshades this during one review, stating "And here comes Titties! \[Violence's\] lovely wife and business partner."

    Western Animation 

-   _American Dad!_ has a lot of this in the episode "For Whom The Sleigh Bell Tolls", but in the name of comedy. For example, comparing sticking a magazine into a gun with the act of penetrating a woman. Also, apparently, Stan and Francine occasionally pull guns on each other and it always ends with "nobody got shot" sex.
    
    **Steve**: (_As they fend off an elf army_) Is it weird that I have a boner?  
    **Stan**: It'd be weird if you didn't!
    
-   Cheryl Tunt in _Archer_ is turned on by physical and emotional violence.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_: "Pretty Poison." Poison Ivy having her Man-Eating Plant restrain Batman's head so she can insistently share a steamy yet deadly goodnight kiss with him, before his unconscious body is devoured, is a _very_ gratifying experience for her.
-   In the _Seth Mac Farlanes Cavalcade Of Cartoon Comedy_ sketch "Sex with Dick Cheney", Cheney's idea of sex is punching the woman in the face several times.
-   _Castlevania_: The penultimate episode of Season 3 does this as all four main storylines crescendo at the same time. So, we get alternating scenes of Trevor and Sypha leading the Judge's men against Prior Sala's cultists, Lenora seducing Hector into sex and slavery, Issac matching his demon army against the Magician's mind-controlled thralls, and Alucard having a three-way with Taka and Sumi as they prepare to kill him.
-   _El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera_: Black Cuervo is a G-rated version of this. For her, fighting against El Tigre is like going on a date; even losing isn't a bad thing as long as he promises to fight her again later. She gets upset if he fights her half-heartedly or doesn't pay attention to her crimes.
