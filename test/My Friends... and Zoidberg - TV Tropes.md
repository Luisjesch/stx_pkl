Introducing the Neighbours! (and a guy)

**Robot 1-X:** How may I help you?  
**Bender:** Save my friends! And Zoidberg!

— _Futurama_, "Obsoletely Fabulous"

A standard comedy trope which, at its core, takes the form:

"Group A... and Bob."

It is often expanded to mention two or more groups that form a supergroup:

In either version, _Bob_ is already expected to be among the group(s) in question, but is singled out as if he's not, usually at Bob's expense; "Bob" can be anyone, including the Butt-Monkey or an Acceptable Target. In extreme cases, the group will be received with cheers, and the name of _Bob_ will be received by Chirping Crickets.

This can be Played for Laughs in cases where it's literally impossible for Bob _not_ to be a member of the groups mentioned.

It can also be used to deliver a Stealth Insult: "We welcome members of all benevolent professions, as well as lawyers." Or, inverted, it can even deliver a compliment: "You morons, and Bob."

Compare: And the Rest, Snub by Omission, Bait-and-Switch Comparison, I Take Offense to That Last One, Guilt by Association Gag, Ladies and Germs, and Insult to Rocks. Compare and Contrast Especially Zoidberg.

See also The Friend Nobody Likes, which overlaps in cases<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  where this person is singled out because, well, they're the friend no one likes.

Not to be confused with Protagonist and Friends, which despite the name, is unrelated.

    Advertising 

-   An Ace hardware commercial has a woman talking to her "friends, neighbors...Scott."
-   In a commercial for the _Monsters vs. Aliens_ animated series: "Don't miss Monsters vs Aliens! ...And Bob."
-   In a "Junkface" ad from Neutrogena, it states that the Junkface problem occurs in "provinces, territories...and Nunavut." According to their Artistic License – Geography, Nunavut is not one of the territories... oh, and its border with the Northwest Territories apparently doesn't exist.
-   A promotion for the Nintendo UK store offered, with a pre-order of _Sonic Boom_, "a free t-shirt featuring a host of likable characters. And Amy Rose."
-   "Avocado can be found in upscale restaurants... and now Subway!"
-   In a 2013 TV Land promo for the season premieres of _Hot in Cleveland_, _The Exes_, and _The Soul Man_, the announcer promotes it as "a night of a thousand stars" before Betty White interrupts and says she only counts 10... and Wayne Knight. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Presumably unintentional example from an advert broadcast in the UK: "Get all these hilarious comedies, and _Grown Ups_ and _The Other Guys_, on Blu-Ray or DVD"

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts_: At the bathhouse, there are three changing rooms: men's, women's, and Hideyoshi's.
-   Natsu of _Fairy Tail_ and anyone who doesn't go on missions with him likes to say either "It's Natsu's group...plus Happy" or "Fairy Tail's strongest team...and Lucy" Lucy and Happy even do it. Only Gray seems kind enough not to.
-   _Mazinger Z_: Hilariously inverted every time the villains told a sentence along the lines of "Go ahead! Finish with Mazinger-Z...and the other two robots!". The other two robots being Aphrodite-A (or Diana-A) and Boss Borot.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Inverted in Sanji's case. Whenever he gets separated from the others, he worries only about the ladies of the crew, and always wants to assist them first. And cares little to not about the other guys.
    -   When Usopp left the crew during the Waters Seven arc, addressing members of the crew tended to be tailed with something along the lines of "And Usopp, I guess".
    -   At the beginning of the Zou arc, one half of the Straw Hat Pirates are looking for the other half (having been separated earlier during the events of Dressrosa) and upon finding their Cool Ship, Luffy starts calling out their names ("Sanjiii! Namiii! Chopper! Broook! Momoooo!") before remembering there was another. ("...And that gassy guy.") This is justified since the guy in question, Caesar Clown, is actually the Straw Hats' hostage, so Luffy can't be bothered to think of him.
-   The dub of _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ gives us this little gem:
    
    **Garterbelt:** Ladies and _Panty_...
    
-   _Pokémon: The Series_: In one early episode, Misty says that she's the 4th sensational sister, who were a trio of water performers and Misty's sisters. One of them said that there are "three sensational sisters and one runt."
-   The non-Cure main characters are usually referred as extra characters: "Pretty Cure and Shiny Luminous." "Pretty Cure \[5\] and Milky Rose."
-   _Saki_:
    -   Kyoutarou, The One Guy of the Kiyosumi mahjong club and by far its worst player, tends to get this from time to time. In the anime, Hisa tells Mako that she locked the three first-years out of the mahjong club room so that Yuuki would be able to study for her exam retake. Mako reminds Hisa that there are _four_ first-years, and Hisa mentions that Kyoutarou is, as usual, doing the heavy lifting for the club.
    -   The trope is lampshaded to an extent when Tsuruga talks about being invited, along with Kazekoshi and Ryuumonbuchi, to help Kiyosumi prepare for the Nationals after their victory in the prefectural tournament. Yumi suspects that Kiyosumi's team wants to practice against Kazekoshi and Ryuumonbuchi, both of whom have been to the nationals before, more than they want to practice against the relative underdog Tsuruga, but sees it as a mutually beneficial arrangement.
        
        **Yumi:** I can understand wanting to play strong opponents in preparation for going up against the monsters at the nationals. Ryuumonbuchi and Kazekoshi from the prefectural finals at least are national-level teams.  
        **Satomi:** Wa-ha-ha. So we're just the extra?  
        **Yumi:** _\[smiles\]_ Kiyosumi isn't trying to be mean. And it doesn't sound half bad to me.
        
-   In the 4Kids dub of _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_, Chazz says "we may be one man down, but we're 5 men strong. Well, 4 men and a lovely lady. Alright, 3 men, a lady, and Syrus!"

    Asian Animation 

-   The English _Pleasant Goat Fun Class_ episode descriptions often refer to the main group of protagonists as the "goats and Wolffy".

    Audio Plays 

-   On _We're Alive_ Michael chastises a bunch of rebellious Tower dwellers by saying "I just sent two of my friends out there to help you people, and I'll not have you throw it back in their faces!" Angel brings it up a bit later:
    
    **Angel:** Didn't we send three people out there?  
    **Michael:** I said two friends. The other one was just Burt.
    

    Comedy 

-   Riche and Eddie in _Bottom_ did this with their Bottom Live 2001: An Arse Oddity tour, during a rather moving funeral scene for Dave the parrot. "Dearly beloved... and Eddie."
-   _The Colbert Report_:
    -   Stephen Colbert announced Dish Network was being sued by all the major networks. And NBC.
    -   Another time, he commented that Putin was banning food imports from all major countries and Norway.
-   Dave Barry: This is one of his running gags.
    -   Once referred to human beings "and Limp Bizkit."
    -   "We, humans and congressmen alike..."
-   Brian Regan: "My wife and I, we have two wonderful kids...and another kid."
-   In this _Saturday Night Live_ sketch, Donald Trump refers to his two oldest sons as "son and Eric."

    Comic Books 

-   _Archie Comics_:
    -   In one story, Jughead is chosen to be a contestant in a game show, _Dull or Not Dull_ (parody of _Deal or No Deal_). Cue this dialogue:
        
        **Jughead:** I need my friends for support. (pause) Oh, and you can come, too, Veronica.
        
    -   Another example, when Archie's superhero persona Captain Pureheart meets Dr. Detest:
        
        **Pureheart:** He's contaminating all my good friends! Also Reggie!
        
    -   A visual variant is with ever-suffering Principal Weatherbee and his file cabinets: students' files are all neatly arranged and alphabetized, but there's an entire cabinet dedicated to Archie alone.
-   _Avengers: The Initiative_:
    
    **Ant-Man:** So, Taskmaster, anybody ELSE still alive?  
    **Taskmaster:** Everybody worth mentioning.  
    **Crusader:** Ahh... my hand...  
    **Taskmaster:** And Crusader.
    
-   _Firefly: The Sting_:
    -   Inara realizes that it's not Mal that keeps her on Serenity, but everyone else, then amends that: "Well, everyone but Jayne."
    -   When Saffron points out to Kaylee that she can still blow up Serenity and its captain, Kaylee muses, "Simon an' Wash are on her, too. An' Jayne, I guess."
-   Hilary Goldstein, reviewing "The 25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels" at IGN, described _Batman: Dark Victory_ as "a fascinating examination of the Batman's most dangerous foes... plus Calendar Man."
-   In a _Justice League of America_ comic, Ultraman (an evil alternate version of Superman) addresses Batman this way. It's really more of his way of un-subtly insulting Owlman (his universe's version of Batman) as having little purpose in the Crime Syndicate. Ultraman and Owlman tend to make remarks like this all the time.
    
    **Ultraman:** Say your goodbyes. Only a few seconds left before the strongest among you—and Batman—find yourselves on our world. We'll kill the others slowly.
    
-   _PS238_:
    
    **Tyler:** He says if he sees me at school again, he'll splat my friends. Oh, and Zodon, too.
    
-   In the 1995 hypothetical one shot _The Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe_, the title character is sentenced to life in jail "for the murder of several of this nation's greatest heroes—and the X-Men Cyclops and Jubilee".
-   _The Transformers (IDW)_:
    -   During _The Transformers: Dark Cybertron_, Orion Pax refers to his allies in the Dead Universe as Autobots, then, when Cyclonus coughs loudly, amends it to "Autobots and Cyclonus." A rare case of doing it out of respect, since Cyclonus _isn't_ an Autobot or Decepticon and gets very irritated when people forget that.
    -   _The Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_: While trying to stop Brainstorm from changing the past, Whirl describes the group of time travellers as containing "seven good-looking 'bots and Riptide."
-   In the Polish comic book series _Tytus, Romek i A'tomek_, in the issue #18 called "Tytus Artystą" ("Tytus As An Artist"), we have this unique case:
    
    **Radio announcement:** A subhuman named Tytus left his home and didn't return, distinguishing marks: has fur. Speaks human and English.
    
-   From one issue of _The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl_:
    
    **The Silver Surfer:** Goodbye, my friends. Goodbye, Loki.
    
    **Loki:** What? You thank pals and then thank me separately?! You used your last words to imply a sick burn on me??
    
-   _Uncanny X-Men_ 537:
    
    **Wolverine:** The stink of what you've been doing is all over you. You're torturing my friends. Summers, too.
    

    Comic Strips 

-   _Garfield_:
    -   Garfield said "The world is filled with many wonders... and Jon".
    -   A rare self-targeted usage in this strip featuring Garfield and Jon discussing Santa.
        
        **Jon:** Santa will be here soon with presents for everyone who's been good.  
        **Garfield:** And me!  
        **Jon:** And you.
        

    Fan Works 

-   In _Albus Dumbledore and the Harbinger of Magic,_ Sirius comments on the spectator-unfriendly nature of the Second Task, due to it taking place underwater.

    **Ichigo:** Friends, teachers... Rukia.
    
-   During book 2 of the _Broken Bow_ series.
    
    **Armani:** Great Lords and Ladies of your respective dominions... and Apollo.

-   Inverted in the _Death Note_ AU _Change of Circumstances_ where L often thinks of Light... and his successors.
-   _Code Prime_: In Chapter 16 of _R2_, as a quietly enraged Megatron is informed of the Decepticons' defeats in the E.U. and the Chinese Federation, he notes that this happened despite the efforts of their cleverest officers... and Starscream.
-   _A Day Without Leonardo_: Raph's "ladies and gentlemen" comment makes specific mention to Mikey, implying him not to be a gentleman. In a sense, the "lady" part of the phrase also singles out Sera, being the only female turtle.
-   Team Four Star's _DragonBall Z Abridged_
    
    **Nappa:** Well, it's been fun, kid. I mean, for me, not for you. As for you (_cut to Piccolo_), everyone important to you is dead.  
    **Krillin:** Hey, I'm still alive—  
    **Nappa:** EVERYONE IMPORTANT.
    
-   In a variation where the format works as a compliment, one Gorillaz fanfic featured Murdoc calling the other band members "you retards—and Noodle". Possibly attempting to save his own skin, given Noodle's Tyke Bomb status.
-   In _Half-Life: Full Life Consequences_, Gordon Freeman, in his dying breaths, tells John Freeman to "Save humens \[sic\] and Henry Freeman".

    **Harry:** Ladies and gentlemen... and Danny, welcome to the Ministry of Magic!
    
-   In _Harry on Adventure_ a sign on the Knight Bus reads:

    Must be willing to put up with all sorts and Mrs Longbottom.  
    Salary negotiable._
    
-   _Harry Potter and the Circle of Light_:

    **Sirius:** Ladies and gentlemen, myself excluded, I present you with the Dog Star, our transportation for the day.
    
-   From _Merlin_ fanfic _How to Pick Up Guys At Bars_: "It took Arthur a little over an hour to decide what to wear. Fretting over clothes was such a girly thing to do, he didn't dare ask any of the men for their help. (Instead, he asked Lancelot.)"
-   This is pretty much how Nighthawk is treated in _I Don't Need Your Civil War_. Special mention to Iron Man, who manages to keep him separate _even from the other Zoidbergs_.
-   In _Mai's Ramblings,_ Mai frequently comments that "everyone and Ty Lee knows..."
-   A Running Gag in _Monster In The Twilight_ and its sequel with the CMC. Adult characters repeatedly refer to them as "The girls. And Featherweight," with Featherweight usually interjecting "Hey!" at the appropriate point.
-   In _Multiverse of Madness: Clea Cut_, the Vision of Earth-717 seems to be the ‘Zoidberg’ to the other Avengers of his world, as he’s basically been reduced to a drone compared to his original self, lacking any real emotion after the Mind Stone was taken from him and apparently staying at the tower rather than acting in the field. 717-Strange explicitly describes Vision as “a retiree \[they\] let hang around out of pity” and Vision acknowledges that’s an accurate assessment.
-   In _My Huntsman Academia_, Katsuki tends to be left out of group announcements because of how irritable he is.
    
    **Yang:** Okay ladies, gentlemen and Bakugou—  
    **Katsuki:** Go to \[gets punched in the gut\] OMPH— Hell!  
    **Yang:** Already there whenever you're around there, Sparky.

-   In _Naruto: The Abridged Comedy Fandub Spoof Series Show_, Naruto laments on how his friends and Sakura were in danger.
-   In _Naruto: the Secret Songs of the Ninja_ when Naruto has his first meeting with Jiraiya:
    
    This was the great Toad Sage who had saved Konoha’s survivors from total annihilation? The disciple of the Third Hokage who was almost a legend? A writer of dirty books for dirty men (and Kakashi-sensei)?
    
-   From _The Pros and Cons to living a triple life_:
    
    **Aqua**: This mission is our responsibility. We’ll handle it together, as a family of Keyblade Wielders and Isa.
    
-   _The RWBY Loops_ has a running gag where someone says "Ladies, gentlemen", and proceeds to name every looper present who is too uncouth or dishonorable to be considered a lady or a gentlemen.
    -   Ironwood later gets one with "Ladies, gentlemen, and whatever Roman is currently identifying as for tax purposes..."
-   _Remnant's Bizarre Adventure_: At one point Weiss greets Team JOJO, "Gentlemen, and Okuyasu," because of the latter's boorish demeanor. Okuyasu lets out a laugh in response.

    **Rarity:** And Fluttershy.  
    **Applejack:** Six dresses.
    
-   From _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_'s Pharaoh's Throne:
    
    **Bakura:** Enough! You may have won this battle, Pharaoh, but you shall not win the war!  
    **Atem:** Yeah, let's do a head count here, shall we? I've got Slifer, Obelisk and Ra: the Egyptian Gods, Priest Seto, who can tear monsters out of people's souls, a girl who can predict the future, one of the most powerful sorcerers in the world, and his... less powerful apprentice, an old man who possesses the ultimate and unstoppable monsters, and Shada. Yeah... not sure what Shada actually does, really, but... but there you go, that's the head count.
    
-   _Young Justice Abridged_: Superman's first line in the series is "Attention, my fellow Americans! And the illegal Martian I tolerate for the time being."
    
    **Martian Manhunter:** _(sighs)_ He always says that.
    

    Film — Animation 

-   _Dorbees: Making Decisions_: In this song about Mr. Poe, there are random moments where they will say, “and Yogul.”

-   _The Super Mario Bros. Movie_: While making a speech to his army, Bowser addresses the Koopas and Goombas by name, but refers to the Spinies as "whatever those things are", much to their disappointment.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Example from The Golden Age of Hollywood: There were seven big studios... and United Artists.
-   _The Boat That Rocked:_ "Thank you gentleman, lady... \[looking at Bob\] strange bearded thing."
-   _Bon Cop, Bad Cop_: "Girls... and Matthieu." The ballet instructor hasn't had any male students in a very long time. He is apologetic, though.
-   _Clerks II_: "Ladies and gentlemen! ...And you, Elias!"
-   _The Fault in Our Stars_: Mr. Lancaster's airport sign reads MY BEAUTIFUL FAMILY (AND GUS).
-   _The First Wives Club_: "Gentlemen? And Daddy."
-   Done in the first film Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers did together, _Flying Down to Rio_, 1933. Fred and Ginger both play members of a music band where Ginger is the band vocalist (and the band's only girl) named Honey. Near the start of the film, Ginger/Honey is with the rest of the band when Fred approaches them and says, "Attention, boys and girls, and you too, Honey!"
-   The French movie _Les Garçons et Guillaume, à table!_ has one right in the title ("Boys! William! Dinner's ready!"). The main character (Guillaume) spent most of his childhood acting like a girl, due to his mother acting as the title implies.
-   In _Home Alone_, Kevin goes to a Santa impersonator and asks for his family to be returned to him. "And if he has time, my Uncle Frank."
-   _Hudson Hawk_:
    
    **Darwin:** Ladies and gentlemen! And Minerva!

-   In _Spaceballs_, Lord Helmet introduces the plastic surgeon as being the best of his profession "in the entire universe, and Beverly Hills."
-   _X-Men: Days of Future Past_: In 1973, Hank McCoy has jerry-rigged a device that can record shows on all three networks and PBS. This matches the common parlance and was probably not intended to be a slight, as PBS does work a bit differently from the three commercial broadcast networks.
-   A serious example in _X-Men: The Last Stand_ when Wolverine sums up Magneto's latest band of mutants. "\[He\]'s got an army...and Jean."

    Literature 

-   Matt does this over and over in his narration in _The Affix_ whenever his stalker ex-girlfriend Liz is with his friends. They don't like her either.
-   _Animorphs_:
    -   All of the blurbs on the back cover described the adventures of "X (the main character of that particular installment), the Animorphs, and Ax," the latter of whom is the Token Non-Human and Sixth Ranger. For his first few books Ax wasn't quite considered part of the team—he was trying to return home, then had trust issues with the others—but even Word of God admits that the blurbs kept this up much longer than it should have.
    -   The comedic version was also done, where Rachel demanded the Helmacrons free "my friends...and Marco, too..."
-   Ciaphas Cain does this to himself in one story.
    
    **Cain:** This was a job for Zyvan's tame psykers and no business of honest men. Or me.
    
-   _The Devil's Dictionary_ defines man as an animal that "\[infests\] the whole habitable Earth and Canada".
-   _Discworld_:
    -   In _Snuff_, it's mentioned that the Watch "appears to include at least one of every known bipedal sapient species, plus one Nobby Nobbs".
    -   A subtle one in _Night Watch_, since it reverses the usual order: "Good evening, Downey, gentlemen..."
-   In _The Guns of the South_ by Harry Turtledove, Abraham Lincoln sends three negotiators to a meeting with the Confederate States, including Ben Butler—incredibly unpopular in the Deep South for his actions in New Orleans, so a calculated insult. Robert E Lee refers to them as "the gentlemen and Mr. Butler".
-   From _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_, Oliver Wood accidentally does it to himself, when he lists the members of the Quidditch team: "We've got three superb Chasers. We've got two unbeatable Beaters. And we've got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match! (after a long pause in which he realizes he's forgotten someone) And me."
-   The protagonist in one of the books in the _Karlsson on the Roof_ series addresses his audience repeatedly as "my friends—and Kirre".
-   In Daniel Pinkwater's _The Last Guru_, protagonist Harold Blatz at once point mails a certificate to "every man, woman, and child in the civilized world and Iceland."
-   _Nowhere Stars_: The Messengers, the setting's Mentor Mascots, are described by the author as "A family of six cute little spirits (and Vyuji)". This is in reference to the fact that Vyuji eschews the cutesy, fluffy animal forms her siblings take, and chooses to appear in her true, humanoid form, which is described as having an Uncanny Valley effect.
-   Isaac Asimov's _Opus 100_: Dr Asimov describes his relationship with publishers as wonderful, except for Gnome Press.

-   The _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ novel _Q-in-Law_ has Q refer to "gentlemen... and Worf".

    Live-Action TV 

### **Award Shows:**

-   At the 90th Academy Awards, when presenting the award for Best Director, Emma Stone used a clever inversion. It wasn't so much an insult as it was a Take That! at gender disparity in Hollywood:
    
    **Stone:** These four men <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and Greta Gerwig created their own masterpieces this year.
    

### **Series:**

-   In season five of _30 Rock_, Tracy has a personal crisis and disappears for several weeks, almost leading to the cancellation of TGS. Upon returning, he goes to his dressing room and is reunited with Grizz, Dot Com, and Kenneth:
    
    **Tracy:** Look, we got a lot of work to catch up on.

    _\[Dot Com gives Kenneth a dirty look\]_
    
-   An episode of _ALF_ had the family throw a party for ALF with all the humans he'd met, in order to show him that he wasn't as isolated as he thought.

-   _All in the Family_ used a variant in "California, Here We Are". Visiting Mike and Gloria over the holidays, Archie and Edith discover the Stivics are separated and that Gloria has been seeing another married man:
    
    **Archie:** How could you do a thing like this to your family? _\[points at Mike\]_ And him...

    -   Leslie has done this several times in reference to her nemesis Sheldon: "Hello, fellow scientists. Sheldon."
    -   Howard gets this a lot because he doesn't have a Ph.D. unlike the others. Usually from Sheldon.
        
        **Sheldon:** And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses, and their friend Howard.
        
    -   One episode Sheldon even goes as far as to refer to the main cast as his three best friends and a "treasured acquaintance". They were unsure which of them was the acquaintance until he returned at the end of the episode.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   A relatively serious case from _The Bill_, in the wake of the 2005 Sun Hill Fire, Inspector Gold asks the team to raise their glasses to the victims, "Ken and Marilyn. Good colleagues, and good friends. And Andrea as well." For context, PC Andrea Dunbar had been exposed as an undercover journalist right before the fire, which had torpedoed a rape trial.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   From season 7 episode "Lies My Parents Told Me": "Have you seen me with those girls? The way I treated my friends, and my family, and Andrew..."

It is about a boy called Valdemar who is the youngest in a huge family and is always forgotten by everybody else who will only think of him at the last moment and then say "oh yes... and Valdemar".

        **Debbie:** Debbie's actually my name!  
        **Kelso:** Then out of fairness to the others you will be "Slagathor". Daves, Debbies, Slagathor, I will be in my office; if you need anything, feel free to bother Dorian.

    **Jordan & Lee:** We are the Axis of Awesome.  
    **Benny:** ...And I'm Benny.
    
-   This is how The B-52s have been since the _Cosmic Thing_ period, where the core four members (and on _Good Stuff_, three) are always considered the group, and the rest of the backing band (bassist, drummer, and keyboardist) are rarely mentioned, except live when it's necessary to introduce them. This backing band doesn't have an input into the songwriting process by all accounts.
-   Beastie Boys, "The New Style":
    
    Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer's day,
    
    Just me and my posse and MCA
    
-   In _The Beatles_ fandom and lore, Ringo Starr often is treated this way—sometimes seriously, sometimes jokingly, depending on the period. Part of this is Ringo's own doing: unlike John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who had, let's say, healthy egos, and George Harrison, who was The Quiet One, Ringo loved Self-Deprecating Humor. He liked to joke that he was actually an awful drummer who was riding the others' coattails; his bandmates, on the other hand, have all said his skills are second to none. Well, or something like that. Also, Ringo was the last Beatle to get his own TV Tropes page. Being a drummer doesn't help, either. Drummers, in general, are often the butt of a lot of jokes about musicians. For example: "What do you call a guy who hangs out with musicians all day?"
    -   McCartney carried this into his post-Beatles career: the liner notes of _Band on the Run_ state that "Paul would like to thank Linda/And Linda would like to thank Paul/And thanx Denny" (that being Laine, the only non-McCartney member of Wings on the album).
-   The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem
-   A subtle version in the liner notes for Faith No More's _King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime_. The band is listed at the beginning of the credits after the lyrics...except for Trevor Dunn, whose guitar credit is listed at the very end, after engineer interns and such. This was a bit of a Take That! at him for bailing on the band after replacing Jim Martin and recording the album because he decided he didn't want to tour.
-   _Friday_: When Rebecca Black says "my friend is by my right," she's sitting between two girls.
-   One song by the Israeli rock band Kaveret mentions "the universe and Bat Yam".
-   Machine Head had a pretty lulzy one at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods awards where they thanked all the awesome bands on Roadrunner...and Nickelback.
-   New Kids on the Block offered a remarkable (and presumably unintentional) put-down to their young female fanbase in "Tonight".
    
    Remember when we travelled 'round the world?  
    We met a lot of people and girls
    
-   The Other Two, a synthpop band with Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert of New Order, got named this way in reference to this trope, as they were "the other two" besides Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook that had their own side projects, Electronic and Revenge respectively.
-   An album from classical parodist P.D.Q. Bach styled as a radio broadcast was introduced as "a program of fine music ... and P.D.Q. Bach."
-   Ever since Freddie Mercury died, Queen has gone by "Queen + (insert singer here)". Singers include Paul Rodgers, Nate Ruess and Adam Lambert.
    -   For other reformations without the original lead singer, Stone Temple Pilots with Chester Bennington and Sublime + Rome.
-   On Showbread's tour supporting their album _No Sir, Nihilism Is Not Practical_, they were the headlining band, with two metal bands opening for them. Showbread's frontman, Josh Dies, referred to the tour several times as "the Monsters of Metal Tour...and Showbread".
-   Poor Jeff Lynne often gets this treatment when someone brings up The Traveling Wilburys. Not helped by being the least recognizable as a solo artist when next to the likes of Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, George Harrison and Bob Dylan.
-   The Velvet Underground managed to pull this off with their first album which featured singer Nico on some tracks. The album's title: _The Velvet Underground & Nico_.

    Myths & Religion 

-   If the trope had been used straight at the time, these biblical examples would have been inversions:
    -   In Mark 16:7, an angel tells the ladies visiting Jesus' (empty) tomb to "tell his disciples _and Peter_" to meet up in Galilee. This is an _inversion_ of the trope: Peter had denied Jesus three times a couple of days before, so the angel is specifying that he _should_ be included among the Disciples.
    -   In the Old Testament, the Bible mentions that Solomon had seven hundred wives, "and Pharaoh's daughter." This acts as an inversion according to many commentators, who note that she's singled out because Solomon loved her much _more_ than the others.
    -   Played straight in Luke 7:29: "When all the people and the tax collectors heard this..."
    -   Another straight example in Exodus 14-7, where Pharaoh sends the 600 best chariots Egypt has after Moses, and all the other chariots Egypt has too.
-   In _The Qur'an_, verse 98 of the second surat says "Whosoever is an enemy unto Allah and _His angels_ and His apostles _and Jibril and Mikail_,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  then verily Allah is an enemy unto the infidels." According to commentators, Jibril and Mikail are apart because they are the most important angels.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   "Sports and pro wrestling." For legal reasons concerning its (mostly) scripted nature, pro wrestling isn't actually a sport. Also, wrestlers aren't allowed to join SAG-AFTRA<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  for similar reasons<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , so they get this from two sides. Japanese pro wrestling famously toys with the ordeal, as while it is not widely considered a _kakutogi_ (combat sport), most of the Japanese media that covers combat sports inevitably has pro wrestling among them and sometimes presented as the main one. And finally, Mexico prefers to consider pro wrestling as pro wrestling, separated both from sport and acting.
-   Mick Foley did this all the time to prank his friend Al Snow. When he "retired", he was presented with the original WWF Hardcore Championship by a lot of the other extreme wrestlers. In his farewell speech, he said "It's an honor to be in the ring with so many hardcore legends. And Al Snow!" On another occasion, he managed to convince a pilot to announce after a landing "Welcome to all the WWF Superstars...and Al Snow."
    -   Mick also used a non-insulting version in his book, about one of his indy matches. "I was busted wide open in front of 25 hardcore wrestling fans and my wife's sister"
-   On the October 29, 2012 edition of _Raw_, Paul Heyman addressed the crowd as, "Ladies, gentlemen, and the people of Charlotte."
    -   During his appearance on "Miz TV" on the June 28, 2013 _WWE SmackDown_, while introducing Curtis Axel, he said, "Ladies and gentlemen, and you too Miz."
-   Assembling a RAW team for the "Bragging Rights" PPV, HHH noted that "we have millions of dollars of talent and Cody Rhodes."
-   A since-deleted picture on Heidi Lovelace's Instagram about The Social Network appearing at _AIW Girls Night Out 11_ featured a sign reading "SOCIAL NETWORK A BITCH A SLUT A PSYCHO OH YEAH AND HEIDI."
-   Utilized by Chris Jericho during one of his feuds with Stephanie McMahon.

    Radio 

-   _Bleak Expectations_: In the opening episode of series 5, Lord Clampvulture makes a toast to the finest minds in Europe... and Harry Biscuit. Harry, being Harry, thinks he's just getting a name check.
-   _The Goon Show_:
    -   Pretty common:
        
        **Grytpipe-thynne:** You may have noticed that throughout the civilized world... and America... British prestige has fallen very low.
        
    -   From the non-politically correct 1950's:
        
        My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen... and Wogs! We present—_The Goon Show_!
        
-   The radio adaptation of the Jack Benny comedy _The Horn Blows At Midnight_ has Ludwig van Beethoven in heaven chastising Jack's character Athaniel (an angel) thusly:
    
    **Beethoven:** We have ten thousand men in this orchestra, Athaniel: nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine musicians, and _you_.
    
-   In 29/01/13, the Rochester\-based classic rock radio station 95.1FM had its DJs mention the Guitar Center's Rock Walk of Fame and the bands included. One DJ says: "The Walk of Fame includes some of the greatest rock and roll bands in history... and Mötley Crüe."

    Sports 

-   During 2019 FormulaOne season, Romain Grosjean and George Russell had a crash at Singapore. They had an off-screen talk to end grudge. Next week, they shared the plane to Russian race, and posted the same picture on Instagram, Zoidberginq _each other_ georgerussell63 To Sochi with friends... and Romain grosjeanromain Flying to Russia with friends and Georges 😉😂 (we are good, no boxing gloves needed)
-   Several NASCAR examples:
    -   Before a NASCAR race in the mid-90s, the person giving the command at the start of the race did it as "Gentlemen, and Jimmy Spencer, start your engines!"
    -   Matt Martin before the 2nd race of the 2005 Gatorade Duel: "Gentlemen, and Dad \[Mark Martin\], start your engines!"
    -   For much of the 2010s, the NASCAR Cup Series was comprised of common men...and Danica Patrick. Similarly, Darrell Waltrip announced green flags at the start of races during Patrick's Cup career by saying "Boogity-boogity-boogity! Let's go racin' boys... and Danica!"
-   Pittsburgh has become known in recent years as "the city of Champions... and the Pirates" in light of their baseball team setting a record for consecutive losing seasons, while the Penguins and Steelers have won multiple championships.
-   It is sometimes said that New York City is home to six professional sports teams... and the Mets (some version of this joke replace them with the Knicks, depending on how the teams are doing at any given time).
-   In basketball:
    -   The 1992 Olympic Dream Team is remembered for being composed of 11 Hall of Famers who are considered some of the best players in the history of basketball... and Christian Laettner (they decided to reserve a slot for a college player to preserve some semblance of amateur status on the team).
        -   During the 2010 Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame induction ceremony, in which the Dream Team officially entered the Hall as a unit, Larry Bird came to the pedestal and said that the team was "a cast of characters and different personalities... then Charles Barkley."
    -   What was originally supposed to be a respected Miami Heat trio ended up being more known as the ultimate Miami duo of Dwyane Wade and LeBron James... and Chris Bosh.
    -   Once LBJ brought someone along with him in his return to Cleveland, people either play it straight or invert: it's the seventh straight NBA finals for James Jones! And some guy named LeBron.
-   There seems to be an inverted version of this when it comes to stereotypes of nations "apathetic" to soccer, in the saying that, _"The only people that hate The Beautiful Game are Americans... and Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, and some Irish."_ This is also true when it comes to stereotypes of nations referring the sport as soccer.
-   Happens in Ice Hockey quite a bit:
    -   The National Hockey League, or rather, the entire sport of ice hockey, considering it is the least popular of the "Big Four" American and Canadian Team Sports<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , gets this quite a bit as some detractors will even omit Hockey from its major league status. Here, the group of leagues would be referred to as "The Big Three Sports...and Hockey."
        
        This happens more frequently the more south you go (in which hockey is cropped out entirely or replaced with NASCAR). Don't say this the farther north you go through, especially in Canada.
        
        -   In markets where hockey has a huge following (Canada, Michigan, Minnesota, New England, etc.) basketball usually fits this trope. For a while, the Minnesota Timberwolves could only be heard on a 9,100-watt station that only reached the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities. The Minnesota Wild, on the other hand, was on 50,000 watt WCCO.
        -   When hockey is not getting this, it's usually Canadian football<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  or soccer<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Conn Smythe began many a public speech with, "Ladies, gentlemen... and Frenchmen." Or some variant.
-   During 2011 and the first half of the 2012 Tennis season, it was common for pundits to say that the greatest players were unquestionably Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal... and Andy Murray, "the other guy" who was unquestionably better than anyone who wasn't Djokovic, Federer, or Nadal but unquestionably overshadowed by them nonetheless. It wasn't until the latter half of 2012 that Murray began breaking out of his "that Tennis player most likely to fill the last spot of the semifinals after Djokovic, Federer, and Nadal show up for their reservations" role.
    -   However, at the end of 2012, Andy Murray took a level in badass and became the first Brit to win a Grand Slam in 75 years. Then, Rafael Nadal dropped out of the 2013 Australian Open and thus out of the top 4 for the first time since 2005. The Top 5 players in Men's Tennis was then therefore composed of: The Big Four... and David Ferrer. More recently, with a late-career resurgence by Stan Wawrinka, some observers put him on a par with the Big Four until injuries and a drop in form ended that.
    -   The 36 men's Grand Slam singles titles between the 2005 French Open and 2013 US Open were won by the Big Four...and Juan Martín del Potro (US Open, 2009).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   The National Collegiate Athletic Association is the primary college-level in the US, comprising of nearly every major and minor college and university in the United States... and Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Theatre 

-   It has become memetically popular to apply this trope to Peggy Schuyler from _Hamilton_. It's combined with The Runt at the End, as she's the youngest of the Schuyler sisters; as such, her lines in their titular "I Am" Song come across as Peggy trying to make her voice heard.
    
    **Angelica Schuyler:** ANGELICA!  
    **Eliza Schuyler:** ELIZA!  
    **Peggy Schuyler:** And Peggy!
    
-   _A Very Potter Sequel_ has Harry say his farewells before his Heroic Sacrifice to all of his friends, but singles out the also present Draco Malfoy and expresses his disgust towards him one last time.

    Video Games 

-   The _Bungie_ Podcast's theme song ends with the line "It's our podcast show, with Brian and friiieeennnds...and Frankie."
-   Used to deliver a Take That! in the end-credits rap from _Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare_:
-   Courtesy of The Dark Id, in the New Game Plus section of his _Chrono Cross_ Let's Play;
    
    After the battle, Solt and Peppor come to investigate the unstoppable end game squad that could murder their entire army busting through the front gate. And Pierre.
    
-   Game Informer's review of _Devil May Cry HD Collection_ said in their concept tab: "Two great games for one great price. Also, _Devil May Cry 2_."
-   Used in one of the endings of _Disgaea 2_. "You aren't alone. You have friends that care about you...And Etna."
-   In _Disney Magic Kingdoms_, during the _Turning Red_ Event, Miriam mentions that in her friends' Self-Insert Fic they are "an all-girl pop group— Well, all-girl plus Tyler. He's our mascot."
-   _Gigolo Assassin_, one of the flash games on Adult Swim's website: "Great nations of the world...and Sweden."
-   _Granblue Fantasy_ has an Inverted example. The Lowain-Elsam-Tomoi trio is sometimes referred to as "Lowain and bros." both in-universe (i.e. referenced by Scathacha in "Bzzt! Amped Up Summer") and by a portion of the playerbase.
-   Used in _Jade Empire_:
    
    **Black Whirlwind's journal:** Kill anything that moves, as long as it doesn't look like one of my companions or the bun man.
    
-   In the soundtrack of _LocoRoco 2_ and _LocoRoco Midnight Carnival_, the singers for the credits song (_etoule pucoratte_) are listed as "Loco Roco All-Stars _and Viole_".
-   In the _Lunar: The Silver Star_ PSP remake, Royce turns your entire party to stone, save for Jessica, who mopes for a second with the line, "My father...my friends...and Kyle..." What makes it funnier is the fact that Kyle is the one who saved her from being "stoned" in the first place. (It may imply that she thinks of Kyle as more than a friend, not less.)
-   _Namco High_: If you talk to Anti-Bravoman, he states the poetry club is full of nice people... and him.
-   _Otomedius_ features "a cast of well-designed characters... and Emon."
-   Is somewhat implied in _Persona 4_ if you take one of Yosuke's statements the wrong (or right way):
    
    **Yosuke:** I have my friends and my family... and you.
    
-   In _Poker Night 2_, at the start of a tournament, GLaDOS will sometimes say "Gentlemen. And Claptrap."
-   _Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal_: "Ladies and gentlemen... oh, and Helga." This is not an insult, however, as Helga seems much cheerier after the addendum. It's likely that this is an objection on her part to Qwark's usage of "ladies" (as Helga is hardly lady material) rather than a reference to her being a robot. Despite being present at the time, Clank wasn't excluded like she was.
-   _Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves_ involves our protagonist having to distract the cops, so he interrupts a meeting (in the _middle of the police station_) being led by his love interest, Carmelita Fox. They are thoroughly distracted when he shouts out, "Attention assorted meatheads...and lady."
-   A _Star Wars: The Old Republic_ quest to repeat the final battle of the _Shadow of Revan_ storyline lists the various NPC allies you'll fight along, with "And C2-D4<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> !" in parentheses after the list.
-   _Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People: Strong Badia the Free_:
    -   After each of the main characters forms their own country, Marzipan organizes a collection of "treasures from all the developed countries, plus Coachnya".
    -   Also, from the trailer:
        
        **Strong Bad:** It's Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People. But you can play too!
        
-   In a hilariously unintentional way, Luigi gets this treatment in _Super Mario World_ when playing Two-Player Mode. Even if Luigi defeats a castle the congratulations screen still says Mario did it. Even if Luigi rescues Princess Peach, she declares that "she, Mario, the Yoshis, and _their friends_ are going on a vacation!" It ain't easy being green. Though this is thankfully changed in later versions of the game like the GBA version where Luigi is listed and given the proper credit that he deserves.
-   If you visit Aesfrost in Chapter 3 in _Triangle Strategy_, Svarog pulls this on Thalas. He warmly greets Frederica, Avlora, and even Erika before pausing and adding "...Thalas" in a notably more annoyed tone.
-   In _Undertale_, encounters involving Jerry introduce him separately from the other monsters, usually with a dismissive statement like "Jerry came too."

    Web Animation

-   _Gridiron Heights_: In the episode parodying _Se7en_, six quarterbacks are put out of commission: Eli Manning, Andrew Luck, Nick Foles, Sam Darnold, Cam Newton, and Ben Roethlisberger, a.k.a. "Big Ben" (a joke on the fact that all of them missed time early in the 2019 NFL season). While confronting the John Doe Expy character, Taysom Hill states that "we lost good men and Big Ben". <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In the _HFIL_ episode "Sharing Circles of Hell", Guldo gives a recap of his death:
    
    **Guildo:** \[Vegeta\] cut off my head... in front of my friends!  
    **Jeice:** And us! (_Guldo slowly turns his head, eyes wide in shock as his jaw drops... followed by Burter high-fiving him_)
    
-   _History Matters_: Whenever the Treaty of Versailles is mentioned, the treaty always says "The Winners (and Belgium)."
-   _Minilife TV_: In "Spirit in the Sky":
    
    **Snowball:** Wait, you have to open up the mall! Our friends are in there!  
    **Archie:** \*beeps\*  
    **Snowball:** Right, and a man named Wilkins.
    
-   _Puffin Forest_ mentions a time when a GM brought together his best and brightest players.
-   _Red vs. Blue_:
    -   The video for the _Halo 3_ demo had the following exchange:
        
        **Sarge:** Another important development from Bungie Labs is the homo-sapien propulsafier, also known as the man-cannon.  
        **Simmons:** It fires men?  
        **Sarge:** Yes, and also Grifs. Come here Grif. Let's says the Blues are launching co-ordinated offensive... What better way to slow them down, then to choke up their movement ways with dead soldiers, or if no soldiers are available, dead Grifs.  
        **Grif:** Wait, what? _\[Sarge knocks Grif out and throws him in the man-cannon\]_
        
    -   Sarge tends to use this a lot when addressing his soldiers, _e.g._
        
        **Sarge:** Alright men... and Donut...  
        **Sarge:** Alright everyone... and Grif...
        
    -   Heck, it even appears on the website for the Recreation DVD, which says it has "all of your favorite characters (and Simmons)".
    -   While Epsilon is stuck in the Monitor body and being worshipped by the aliens, he's called upon to give a eulogy. He begins this way.
        
        Epsilon: _\[to aliens and Caboose\]_ Attention true believers! _\[turns to the Reds and Tucker\]_ And other people.
        
-   _RWBY_:
    -   In the first episode of season 2, Ruby addresses the other members of her team and JNPR.
        
        **Ruby:** Sisters! Friends! Weiss.  
        **Weiss:** Hey!
        
    -   After a fight with RWBY in "Painting the Town...", even Roman gets in on the act:
        
        **Roman:** Ladies... Ice Queen...  
        **Weiss:** Hey!
        

    Webcomics 

-   _8-Bit Theater_: "The Fighting Fighters, Also Bikke." Seen here
-   _Ansem Retort_'s Axel started off his closing speech with "Ladies, Gentleman, Marluxia of the jury..." (Though that might be him not knowing what gender Marluxia is.)
-   From the _Basic Instructions_ strip How to Be Kind to the Least Among You:
    
    **The Judger:** We are "The Legion of Superheroes, and the Knifeketeer," a collection of the world's mightiest crime fighters. And the Knifeketeer.  
    **The Knifeketeer:** I'm feeling a bit excluded.  
    **The Judger:** You're included. That's what "and" means.
    
-   _Brawl in the Family_ gives us an example in this strip:
    
    **Kirby:** Best of friends on an adventure! Also Meta Knight
    
-   _Buttersafe_ uses this in the saddest punchline ever written in The Tragic Life of Annabelle.
    
    **Man:** Everyone that ever loved you just died. Your mother will be here to pick you up shortly.
    
-   _Casey and Andy_: for a tabletop roleplaying game, Andy invents the character of Bob, whose one ability is that he can show up any time something is described in narrative. Thus, every time Casey tries to describe something, Andy simply adds, "Bob was there too!"
-   In _Commander Kitty_, Fluffy is many things...but an intelligent life form is apparently not one of them.
    
    **Nin Wah:** Those drones are programmed to relinquish command in the presence of an intelligent life form.  
    **CK:** ...and _Fluffy,_ it would seem.
    
-   _Darths & Droids_:
    
    **C-3P0:** I love it here. A beautiful desert cruise with wonderful friends. And you.
    
-   From _El Goonish Shive_, an example that manages to be as insulting as it is complimentary.

    **Tedd:** Hey, are you calling Grace a freak?  
    **Sarah:** Nope.

    **Xerxes:** Are you going to introduce me to your friends?  
    **Rogue:** I would if there were any here.
    
-   A rare example of the trope being used as a compliment, let alone to oneself, occurs in _FreakAngels_ when Karl introduces himself to Alice.
    
    **Karl:** Welcome to the home of ten twentysomethings with arrested development and an obsession with loud, crap shagging. And me.
    
-   _Looking for Group_: This comic takes this to an extreme.
    
    **Cale:** Ladies and gentlemen. And gnomes. Bloodrage. Skeletons. Sisters and sons. Imps. And— What is that?  
    **Richard:** A gruffalo.  
    **Cale:** A gruffalo? What's a gruffalo?
    
    -   There's also this one where Richard sulks about being left out of the happy reunion.
-   A _Mortal Kombat_ sprite comic uses this:
    
    **Jax:** _Alright ladies and gentlemen, and Nightwolf, here's how this plan is gonna work..._
    
-   From _Not Quite Daily Comic_, a straight example in this strip: "Dear friends (and Malène)..."
-   The profile blurb of _Once Stung_ describes Queen Bees foes as "a gallery of freakish supervillains (And one guy named Jerry)".
-   _The Order of the Stick_: Belkar gets this treatment from the Order. For an early example,
    
    **Durkon:** They be a fine group, for humans. And an elf.  
    **Hilgya:** And a halfling.  
    **Durkon:** No, I left 'im out on purpose.
    
-   Kaitlyn from _Precocious_ here.
    
    **Kaitlyn:** I just wanted my best friends (and Roddy) to come over and play our favorite games.
    
-   In _Sinfest_, "Plus these guys."
-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_: At some point, Onni calls the group formed by the main members of the cast "the flock of clowns... and Lalli". Lalli is Onni's younger cousin, whom he pretty much raised.
-   _Vexxarr_ used another variation:
    
    **Sploorfix:** ...a war in which millions of _innocent, intelligent_ beings will _perish_?  
    **Vexxarr:** No, no. See, the _Lattroxx_ and _Bleen_ would be fighting _each other_...

    -   In the same vein, a review on that site about the post-Flashpoint _Justice League_ series mentioned that it had "some of the greatest characters in the history of comic books and Aquaman."
-   _Cracked_:
    -   Observe the ad in the second panel of this comic:
    -   This article uses this trope to take a stab at _Avatar_:
        
        Quick! What do Yoda, Belle, Gollum, the Avatar chick, and the entire cast of _Looney Tunes_ all have in common? Besides their ginormous eyes, obviously? Well, in addition to not being real humans, the voices who provided some of the most memorable characters in cinematic history — and _Avatar_ — are all ineligible to win Academy Awards for their performances because, apparently, voice acting is not "acting."
        
-   An entry in Mario Lanza's _Funny 115 V.2_, a _Survivor_ fansite, we are treated to "It is day 39, and it is time for the final two and Mick to face the jury."

-   _Critical Role_: One of the Running Gags of the second campaign was that every episode, Sam Riegel would wear the exact same outfit he'd worn during that same episode of the first campaign, up to and including his Halloween costume. In the episode right after Mollymauk's death, he decides to retire the shirt bit (mostly because he chose to wear a custom-made shirt with a close-up of Matt grimacing weirdly that day). For the rest of the episode, a piece of paper taped to his flask reads "RIP Shirt Bit, 2018-2018 (Oh, also Molly)."

-   The Honest Game Trailer for the Nintendo Switch describes Nintendo as "the creators of some of the most successful and beloved consoles of all time and also the Wii U".
-   _Just Bad Games_ gives a brutal one to _Aquaman_, though since he's taking shots at _Aquaman: Battle for Atlantis_ along with _Batman: Dark Tomorrow_ and _Superman The Man Of Steel_ it's admittedly pretty low-hanging fruit:
    
    **Rerez:** These three titles are bound by a cursed fate, each one showcasing some of the worst elements to have ever graced game adaptions of these enormously popular franchises... and Aquaman!
    
-   _LegalEagle_ gets a good dig in at _Half As Interesting_ in this manner when advertising the streaming service _Nebula_:

    Do you really have that little clue what to do with the crew of Fox and friends? \[Beat\] And Slippy?
    
-   _Shiny Objects Videos_: Exaggerated in "On the Couch".
    
    **Curly:** Aah, we're like The Three Musketeers! Plus Nathan. Plus Guido.  
    _\[there are only four people there\]_
    
-   _Solidjj's_ video about the Sinister Six keeps pointing out the Chameleon is a bit of an odd one out in the group, mostly obviously in Spider-Man's reaction "It's all of my greatest foes! And the Chameleon!" Also:

Now that Kevin's gone, the gag has extended to other members of the crew that don't normally appear like Vernon, Jack, Matt and Ryan.

    **Mrs. Gordon:** Ladies. Gentlemen. Hoodsey.
    
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
    -   "It's three on three-plus-Sokka." Sokka's not a bender... but neither are two of the opponents.
    -   The Avatar Extras re-airings get into it too. At the end of "The Chase", when the Gaang plus Zuko attack Azula, it notes this is the first time in the series all four elements are seen attacking at once. Plus Sokka.
-   In "This Is Actually My Party" from _Charlie and Lola_, Charlie says that all of his friends are invited to his birthday party, and Lola. Which comes across as a bit odd since the two are generally pretty friendly.

        **Timmy's dad:** Hey, that's me!
        
    -   Another instance occurs earlier in the episode, when after watching a news report about Chip's fans rioting in his absence, Timmy says "I've gotta get Chip to the concert before all those women—and my dad—tear the town apart!"
    -   In another episode:
        
        **Timmy:** Everyone I know and love (and Mr. Crocker) are headed...!

-   _Futurama_ is the Trope Namer, so expect it to have a lot of examples.
    -   Zoidberg is the trope namer, if not the outright king.
        -   Bender's plea to Robot 1-X that he "Save my friends! And Zoidberg!" Over the course of the show, the writers have been trying to develop Zoidberg to have occasional bouts of heroic moments, in which he _averts his own trope!_
        -   Zoidberg later returned the insult, referring to Leela, Fry, and Bender as "my friends and the robot."
        -   Zoidberg even Zoidbergs himself:
            
            **Fry:** Everyone we invited is here.  
            **Zoidberg:** Also Zoidberg!
            
        -   Zoidberg even did it in the midst of a monologue.
            
            **Zoidberg:** So all over the world, couples stood together in joy. And me, Zoidberg!
            
        -   In "Mobius Dick" there is a flashback to fifty years earlier when Zoidberg was popular enough to use this joke on the captain of the first Planet Express Crew.
            
            **Zoidberg:** Hey, it's all my favourite patients, and also Captain Tucker! Pow!  
            _\[general laughter, high fives exchanged\]_  
            **Captain Tucker:** You totally got me, Dr. John. You're hilarious.

    -   In "The Deep South", folk singer Donovan talks about how all the quality people (like Jeff Foxworthy and the inventor of Coca-Cola) evacuated the sinking city of Atlanta. As the boat pulls away and in the middle of his narration, Jane Fonda charges through the crowd, shoving people aside and leaps into the boat at the last second, prompting Donovan to add "And Jane Fonda was there too" mid-sentence.
    -   A stealth subversion in "Proposition Infinity": <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Also achieved twice in quick succession (both being acknowledged by the potential Zoidberg in question) in "Into The Wild Green Yonder", when the gorilla hole is being tested:
        
        **Lead Tester:** Stand by, men! ...and manly aliens.  
        **Lead Tester:** _\[after hole is successfully completed\]_ Good work, men! ..and manly aliens.
        
    -   Sort of inverted in "Less Than Hero", insulting Fry. The New Justice Team theme song names Super King and Clobberella, but Captain Yesterday (Fry) falls under "all the rest" despite being the only other member.
    -   Used in "Zapp Dingbat"
        
        **Zapp:** Honored guests... and Kif.
        
    -   Inverted in "Bender's Big Score":
        
        **Lars:** Hello to everyone who isn't Leela. And a _very special_ hello to everyone else.
        
    -   From "Anthology of Interest II":
        
        _(Winged monkeys Walt, Larry and Igner swoop down and grab Leela, Fry and Bender, leaving Zoidberg alone.)_  
        **Zoidberg:** _(indignant)_ What, do I smell or something? _(smells own armpit)_ Awwwww.
        
    -   Inverted in _Zoidberg's_ favor with the Robot Santa Claus, who was designed to give presents to the nice and punish the naughty. However, a programming error rendered his standards too high and leads him to pretty much just try to murder everyone... except for Zoidberg, the only one who somehow met those absurdly high standards.
    -   In "Brannigan, Begin Again", when the Planet Express ship is plunging toward the Neutral Planet, Bender tells Leela, "Leela, save me!... And yourself, I guess!... And my banjo!... And Fry!"

-   In _Horrid Henry_, _Horrid Henry and the Lost Dog_, Peter finds a dog's hair and analyses in his "lab", where he finds that it isn't a human hair, "and it isn't one of Henry's either".
-   A variant occurs in _Kim Possible: So The Drama_, wherein Kim responds to being asked if it's guy trouble, "It's not a guy, it's _Ron_."
-   _King of the Hill_:
    -   They used this trope at least once.
        
        **Hank:** Hey guys...and Kahn.  
        **Kahn:** Hello!
        
    -   Dale does it in "The Honeymooners" episode.
        
        **Hank** You guys don't have to come.  
        **Dale** Of course we're coming. We're the three amigos! ...And Bill.
        
-   In one episode of _Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness_ Po makes a huge thing about how skilled and dangerous his enemies are. Then he looks over at Fung and Gah-ri and adds "And two guys who try _really_ hard!"
-   _Molly of Denali_: Trini tries to shoehorn her way into the theme song.
    
    "Together with \[Molly's\] best friend Tooey always by her side"
    
    "And Trini!"
    
-   In _The Owl House_ episode "Really Small Problems" has Gus refer to him, Luz, Willow and King as "my best friends... and King"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  while they were fighting for their lives in a mini circus.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_:
    -   From the episode "What Do It Do?":
    -   In "The Lizard Whisperer", during Ferb's speech to motivate Phineas and Isabella:
        
        **Ferb:** And we few, we happy few, we small band of brothers—and girl from across the street—
        
    -   In _Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel_:
        
        **Phineas:** Gentlemen...and Hulk, Welcome to S.H.E.D.
        
-   _Pinky and the Brain_: "Actually, we're two genetically-altered lab mice dressed as wallpaper hangers in an attempt to Take Over the World! Oh, and he's Larry."
    
    **Larry:** Hi there!
    
-   _Ready Jet Go!_:
    -   In "Commander Cressida Begins", after Mindy and Sydney ask Celery to take them to space, Celery exclaims "Girls trip!". After Sunspot gets annoyed, Celery changes it to "Girls and Sunspot trip!"
    -   In "Freebird", the snow geese are collectively referred to as "The Hanks and Cynthia".
-   _Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated_: Daphne's father delivers one when he is hosting a dinner for a visiting Chinese delegate in "The Dragon's Secret":
    
    **Daphne's father:** Mr. Wang, friends... Fred.
    
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   "Deep Space Homer" includes this, when a NASA guy starts a press conference with: "Ladies and gentlemen and members of the press..."
    -   Justified in "Margical History Tour", when the story of Lewis and Clark is retold with Lenny and Carl, which leads to an unavoidable contradiction.
        
        **Homer (as Chief):** We have always known of the coming of the white man, and Carl.
        
-   _South Park_:
    -   Cartman is a frequent target of this. For example, in one early episode Kyle comments that he thinks of the group as his family—"except for Cartman."
    -   In one episode, the boys download music illegally and are taken to the police station for it. When the chief talks to them about their crime, he mentions they downloaded hundreds of songs from famous bands and artists... and Judas Priest.
-   _The Spectacular Spider-Man_: "Now gentlemen..._and Rhino_..."
-   In the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)_ episode "Metalhead", Donatello says "Gentlemen, and Raphael" before unveiling the eponymous attack drone. Raph is not amused by this, but Mikey seems to be.
-   _Teen Titans (2003)_:
    
    **Cyborg:** Ladies and gentlemen...and whatever Beast Boy is<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> ...
    
-   There's a Swedish cartoon centered around this, called _The Three Friends... and Jerry_. Lampshaded in a short segment where Jerry asks "Why can't it be 'The Four Friends'? I'm a friend!" Only for Thomas to reply, "Just be glad your name is in the title!" To which Jerry protests, "But why single me out like that?"
-   In the _Timon & Pumbaa_ episode "The Laughing Hyenas: TV Dinner", this is done visually. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed sit in directors chairs. Shenzi has the megaphone of _Director 1_, Banzai has the megaphone of _Director 2_, but Ed has a megaphone labeled simply _Ed_.
-   _Tiny Toon Adventures_:
    -   In one episode:
        
        **Buster Bunny:** Ladies and gentlemen...  
        **Montana Max:** _\[in audience\]_ BOOOOOO! BOOOOOOOO!  
        **Buster Bunny:** ...and Monty.
        
        -   Monty's butler, Grovely manages to use the same wisecrack in another episode, somehow managing to avoid Monty's wrath.

    -   In "The Ex-Files", Chris makes an announcement to "all players and brooding goth chick" to attend the elimination ceremony. Gwen's the player who got her team the victory that day, but it's overshadowed by the hate she has garnered from cheating with Duncan.
    -   Brick addresses his team consisting of four guys and one girl politically correct in "Backstabbers Ahoy!": "Men, and Dawn..."

-   From _Xiaolin Showdown_:
    
    **Omi:** Xiaolin Warriors, double your efforts! Raimundo, triple yours.
    

    Real Life 

-   At the 2008 _Discworld_ convention, the convention chairman made a speech beginning: "My lord Patrician. Honoured Guild leaders. Ladies and gentlemen. Members of the Watch. Nobby. And Bernard Pearson."
-   A few stock jokes:
    -   "Three musicians and a drummer"
    -   "Three men and a tenor"
    -   "Three reporters and the gentleman from the _Times_" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Frequently used when writing the Acknowledgments section of a doctoral thesis, as you will probably have to thank several people for political reasons, even if they don't actually merit mentioning. "I'd like to thank everybody who contributed to this project, and also this pet student my professor has". In extreme cases, your advisor is Zoidberg!
-   Before he became a senator, Al Franken performed at a Clear Channel pro-Iraq War rally. (He admits it's not his proudest moment, since he was against the Iraq War, just as he is now.) He opened with: "Ladies, Gentlemen, SportsRadio 640 WGST contest winners, and Lee Greenwood..." This incident is referenced in his book, _Lies and The Lying Liars Who Tell Them_.
-   One of Neil Gaiman's earlier books, _Ghastly Beyond Belief_ (co-written with Kim Newman) is dedicated "_To all intelligent lifeforms everywhere...and to my sister Claire._"
-   Doug Demuro, Jalopnik communist, invoked this trope with the passage: "For proof, I start with my own experience owning German cars. I've owned eight, in total: one from every important German automaker, and also Volkswagen. And they were all complete pieces of crap."
-   At the 2006 Academy Awards, Jon Stewart (who was hosting) opened with "Good evening everybody, ladies, gentlemen...Felicity." (Felicity Huffman, who was nominated for playing a trans woman in _Transamerica_.)
-   From a community-driven appliance drive: "We accept all appliances...and microwaves."
-   Any speech that opens in the style of "Friends, Romans, countrymen..." risks sounding like this, especially if the listener perversely insists on interpreting the list as non-intersecting groups. The U.S. President's annual State of the Union address traditionally begins with something along the lines of "Ladies, gentlemen, members of Congress, distinguished guests..." In England, the proper way to greet a crowd is "Ladies, gentlemen, and officers of the Royal Navy", due to a decree by Queen Victoria stating that officers of the Royal Navy are not considered gentlemen.
-   In Argentina, after a train accident, this immortal line was given: "Murieron tres personas y un boliviano", or if you prefer: "Casualties are three persons and a Bolivian".
-   A probably unintentional one, Creative Commons licenses have versions readable by "humans", "machines" and "lawyers".
-   Can't we just say everyone and Linda?
-   This sign: "\[Population\] 451 + Dennis"
-   This billboard: "Why leave a city that has six professional sports teams, and also the Mets?"
-   Due to the Cold War, in a number of historical and fictional works about World War II, the Western Allied Powers are often shorted to simply Allied Powers, although the latter also included the Soviet Union and its allies (such as Polish Armia Ludowa). "Allied Powers... and the Soviet Union" sounds just like the trope.
-   When Khrushchev came to power in USSR, the opposition in the Central Committee was labeled "the factionary anti-party group which included Molotov, Kaganovich... _and Shepilov who adjoined them_", mostly to discount at least _one_ member of the group—eight members of the Communist Party top rung being in an "anti-party group" was considered too much. "Shepilov" immediately became a memetic alias for any extra person joining an established group, and it become a joke that the longest last name in Russia was Andshepilovwhoadjoinedthem. Later, Shepilov even wrote his memoirs titled "The Unadjoined".
-   As of the 2015 Canadian federal election, the House of Commons consists of 184 Liberal MPs, 99 Conservative MPs, 44 New Democratic Party MPs, 10 Bloc Québécois MPs, and Elizabeth May.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Steve Coogan in this Guardian article about _Top Gear_:
    
    "I've been fortunate enough to work with the likes of Peter Baynham, Armando Iannucci, Chris Morris, Simon Pegg, Julia Davis, Caroline Aherne, Ruth Jones, and the Mighty Boosh some of the funniest and most innovative people in British comedy. And Rob Brydon too."
    
-   During the January 18th Internet blackout protest, Gawker had a headline of "Today, some of the best websites on the internet—and Reddit—are blacked out to protest SOPA."
-   As of a 2023 reform, responsible for organizing social and health care and rescue services in Finland will be 21 welfare areas... and the City of Helsinki.
-   The G8 is often referred to by the press as "The 7 most developed countries... and Russia." <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   An intentional one: _Canada and Quebec pension plan_.
-   The full name of the UK can come across like this: The United Kingdom of Great Britain<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and Northern Ireland.
-   Rice University has a residential college system. When Martel was built, it was founded as a dormitory instead of a college, receiving 60 freshmen from the other colleges. The other colleges then decided to agree that Martel doesn't properly qualify as a college. Although Duncan and McMurtry have been built since then and are considered colleges, the running joke that "Martel is not a college" still remains, making common such statements as, "Remember, there are nine other colleges and Martel."
-   The "Lady Gaga Daily" Twitter feed reported on 12/4/12 that: "Lady Gaga is up against many talented artists and Nicki Minaj for three 2012 World Music Awards."
-   It's rather common to hear U.S. media say something along the lines of "X states and the District of Columbia", due to D.C.'s weird status in regards to statehood—officially it's not a state and so only gets one non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives and nothing at all in the Senate, but unlike US territories such as Puerto Rico and American Samoa (who get similar arrangements in Congress) the District is granted three electoral votes in the Electoral College (and this required the 23rd Amendment to be passed in 1961).
-   A common joke: Members of the Ivy League and Brown.
-   The Times of London website has a UK News tab, containing such topics as Media News, Crime, Law, and Scotland.
-   This quote from Orthodox Rabbi Yosef Edelstein concerning the morality of the death penalty.
    
    I think it's clear that with regard to Jewish jurisprudence, the capital punishment outlined by the Written and Oral Torah, and as carried out by the greatest Sages from among our people ... did not remotely resemble the death penalty in modern America (or Texas).
    
-   From the 2012 White House Correspondents' Dinner:
    
    **George Bush:** I believe we're an America that should come together: Democrat, and Republican, and John McCain.
    
-   Inverted by Rachel Maddow, who once described Fox News as "a full employment program for Republican politicians and their patrons, plus a couple of journalists named Shep Smith and Greta van Susteren." Smith is widely acknowledged by the mainstream media as the Only Sane Man of Fox News who refuses to go along with his more partisan colleagues' blatant biases, and van Susteren is actually a good friend of Maddow's who has earned respect for her reporting from many in the profession. The obvious implication, of course, was that no one else employed by Fox qualified as a real journalist.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   The megaregion of Southern California (that's with a capital "S") includes every county south of San Luis Obispo County, except Imperial County.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Hence, in order to describe the entire geographical region, it's sometimes referred to as "Southern California and Imperial County" or something synonymous. The reason is that Imperial County's population is an order of magnitude smaller than any of the other countries included within the megaregion, or in the case of Los Angeles, _two_ orders of magnitude smaller. And just like Zoidberg, most natives can remember the other counties but forget that Imperial exists.
-   When the US Constitution was ratified, Alexander Hamilton was part of the New York delegation; however, he'd been saddled with two other New York delegates who opposed the document and who ended up walking out. Unwilling to pass up the opportunity to put his name to the historic document, Hamilton—despite having no authority to do so—signed anyway, leading Washington to dryly note in his private journal that the Constitution was signed by "11 states and Colonel Hamilton." (Despite the snark, Washington appreciated Hamilton's service here, especially given that Hamilton had been one of Washington's most trusted advisors during the war.)
-   Several magazines and websites previewing _The Defenders (2017)_ used the joke of "your favorite Marvel Netflix show heroes. And Iron Fist."
-   Analgesic drugs: opioids, non-steroid anti-inflammatories... and paracetamol.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Ask anyone to tell you the actors who played James Bond, they most likely would say: "Sure, Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig" and _some_ times, "oh, and George Lazenby".
    -   Poor Barry Nelson, David Niven and Bob Holness.
    -   Not to mention Toby Stephens, who's played Bond _nine times_, more than any other actor, but gets forgotten because he played him on radio rather than film.
