Poisoning is an effective means of disposing of an enemy. Depending on the mechanism of action, the poison can either be slow or fast-acting.

One of the more common methods of poisoning in media is slipping said poison into someone's drink. It gets the job done without attracting too much attention.

When it comes to signifying that a character has been poisoned by their drink, one of the most effective signifiers is the character in question dropping their drink vessel. Sometimes the vessel breaks because it's glass, other times because it's made of a different material, it just spills.

The trope also covers druggings.

Subtrope of Dramatic Drop. An aftereffect of Tampering with Food and Drink and Poisoned Chalice Switcheroo. Compare Faceplanting into Food. For a defeated enemy in a video game dropping a poisoned drink or other undesirable item, see Poison Mushroom.
