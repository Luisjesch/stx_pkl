_"You can't be mean to my Waddle Dees! Only **I** can be mean to my Waddle Dees!"_

A subtrope of Aw, Look! They Really Do Love Each Other, and/or Friendship Moment, in which a character who frequently bullies or teases another is the first to stand up for them if they get the same treatment from anyone else. The time-honored cliche is "You can't do that to them. Only _I_ can do that to them!"

For example, Alice and Bob are going out, and Alice never misses a chance to call Bob a jackass. Then, one day, Bob screws up big time in front of Charlie, who calls Bob a jackass. Cue Unstoppable Rage from Alice.

May include an impassioned speech on what Alice will do to Charlie if he ever _dares_ disrespect Bob again... before the payoff that it's not because she doesn't want Bob to be abused, it's because doing so is _her_ job, dammit!

This dynamic can exist in all sorts of relationships, from couples to friends to, perhaps most commonly, siblings (combining Sibling Rivalry with Big Brother Instinct), or the unpopular but tolerated member of a group.

Frequently a sign of Belligerent Sexual Tension, Vitriolic Best Buds, Tsundere, or Moral Myopia. Often a Jerk with a Heart of Gold trait. Compare The Only One Allowed to Defeat You, where a character's enemy will come to his or her defense if anyone else attacks him/her.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _7 Seeds_, most of Semimaru's behavior towards Natsu comes across as this. He bullies her, but when Hibari talks down to Natsu and calls her a useless, spineless doormat, Semimaru gets pretty nasty. That's _his_ prey, after all. Not that Hibari believes "prey" to be the right term.
-   _The Beautiful Skies of Houou High_:
    
    **Kei:** Why did you help me back there?  
    **Yui:** Because the only one allowed to make fun of you is _me_!
    
-   In _Berserk_ the Anti-Hero protagonist Guts early on the Black Swordsman arc declares that he loathes the weak and anyone who can’t protect themselves deserve to die. Cut to the Conviction Arc where Guts is dropping everything to protect his insane and defenseless lover Casca who’s largely weak and cannot look after herself. Besides Casca, Guts also goes out of his way to protect the likes of Theresia, Jill, Farnese, Isidro and Schierke most of whom are physically quite weak. So for someone who vocally hates the defenseless, he certain saves and protects a lot of them.
-   In _Don't Toy with Me, Miss Nagatoro_, Nagatoro gets furious with her friends on several occasions for their mistreatment of Senpai, even though what they do isn't that different than what she does to him. Downplayed in that, by the time her friends get a real introduction, Nagatoro has already started to get attached to Senpai, and her bullying has scaled down to teasing.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Chi-Chi never wastes a moment to chide her husband Goku for being a layabout with no job, frequently calling him a idiot when in a bad mood. Yet in the anime when she hears a nasty and sadistic tutor she hired for Gohan call Goku a “worthless father”, Chi-Chi defenestrates the bastard without a moment hesitation. It seems as far as Chi-Chi is concerned only _she’s_ allowed to insult Goku, _anyone else_ who insults her beloved dumb hubby is just asking for pain.
    -   _Super_ has this dynamic pop up between twin brothers Beerus and Champa of the Universe Survival arc. After learning that the Kais of the other universes held a meeting without inviting the Kai of Universe 7, Champa engages his own meeting with the other Gods of Destruction to make sure they weren't planning anything underhanded, and gets notably stressed once the topic moves to Beerus, and by extension, Goku, since they're scapegoating the entirety of Universe 7 for putting them through the tournament and slating them for destruction if they lose when both Champa and Vados know that Zen'o was planning on destroying them anyway until Goku reminded him of the tournament. When this claim falls on deaf ears, he gets visibly irate at them disrespecting both his brother and Goku despite his intense rivalry with Beerus.

-   In Datto Nishiwaki's manga adaptation of _Fate/stay night_, Shinji is still very much a Big Brother Bully to Sakura, but there's also a flashback where he defended her against the archery club president's bullying the previous year. It's part of a pattern of downplaying Shinji's worst behavior from the visual novel (including him not raping Sakura on a regular basis like in the VN), leading up to him pulling something of a Heel–Face Turn, accepting defeat in the Grail War and not dying like he does in most of the VN's routes.
-   In _Fruits Basket_, Rin gets physical with Tohru, ever since their first meeting, e.g., grabbing her by the collar, roughly rubbing her head, etc. The moment Kagura punches Tohru (and accidentally knocks her out) in frustration that she won't confess her feelings to Kyo so that Kagura wouldn't have to think about him anymore, Rin gets the angriest anyone has seen her in the story. Contains some Fridge Brilliance in that Rin acts that way because of how different she and Kagura are. Both have bad tempers, but Kagura does not know her own strength and frequently hurts others by accident when riled up. Rin knows that _she_ isn't a serious danger to Tohru, but she can't trust Kagura to have the same discipline.
-   In the later episodes of _Hikaru no Go_, Touya frequently employs this in regards to Shindou:
    
    _\[heavy arguing between Touya and Shindou, Shindou storms off\]_  
    **Customer:** That Shindou really needs to learn his place. A mere first-dan shouldn't argue against the young master.  
    **Touya:** _\[enraged\]_ No matter how good you are, you're a first-dan when you start off. Don't look down upon Shindou just because he's a first-dan! _\[strides away indignantly\]_
    
-   In _House of the Sun_, Chihiro is complaining to her best friend Mao about how her love interest Oda is an idiot. Mao agrees, saying that he is an idiot. Chi quickly shoots back that Mao is not allowed to call him an idiot.
-   Tomoe from _Kamisama Kiss_ is normally sarcastic, rude, and highly critical of just about anything Nanami does. But should anyone else insult her and/or criticize her, he is quick to come to her defense.
-   _Kiss and White Lily for My Dearest Girl_ provides a non-bullying example. Yukina chastises Towako in private for sabotaging the Gardening Club, but refuses to let the student council say anything critical about her. Since Yukina and Towako are in the same hierarchy, this trope is given connotations of "providing a united front".
-   In _My Hero Academia_, Sir Nighteye doesn't think very highly of Midoriya, considering him an Inadequate Inheritor of One for All compared to Nighteye's protégé Mirio. While Midoriya is out on patrol with Mirio, he has no choice but to let Eri go back to her abusive father Overhaul, since Nighteye had ordered the heroes not to interfere with Overhaul while the investigation was in progress. When Midoriya gets back and tells Nighteye about the incident, Nighteye criticizes Midoriya for wanting to rush in and save Eri without a plan. Later, however, it turns out that not saving Eri was a much worse idea than even Midoriya thought,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  but when Rock Lock complains about what happened, Nighteye takes responsibility and defends Midoriya and Mirio, saying they were Just Following Orders and they feel the worst about Eri's situation.
-   In _Nabari no Ou_, Raikou physically abuses Gau on a regular basis. When an unnamed mook hurts Gau, Raikou kills him and _mutilates his dead body_.
-   In _One Piece_, while Sanji often bickers with his mentor and father figure Zeff, Zeff defends Sanji when the other cooks call Sanji out for feeding Don Krieg, asking whether any of the cooks know what it's like to starve (an experience that Zeff and Sanji shared).
-   _Oreimo_:
    -   Kyousuke constantly jabs Manami about how normal and plain she is, but when Kirino offhandedly makes a similar remark about her, Kyousuke has this to say:
        
        **Kyousuke:** I hate hearing someone other than me badmouthing her!
        
    -   A Foreshadowing of sorts, this trope also (somewhat) applies to the Little Sister Heroine Kirino herself. When her friends Ayase and Kanako come over for a visit, they hear her constantly berating Kyousuke (which the poor man overhears), but once Kanako adds her own words, Kirino stays silent instead of agreeing with her.
-   _PandoraHearts_:
    -   At the beginning of the manga, Alice calls Oz her property and protects him from people who want to hurt him, but will consistently hit him herself.
        
        **Alice:** Nobody touches my _property_! And Oz is my manservant—therefore, he is my property!
        
    -   At one point, Oz yells at somebody because they've made Gilbert upset and states that _he's_ the only one allowed to make Gilbert cry.
-   _Psyren_:
    -   Fredrica often bullies Marie. However, when someone else threatens her, targets her, and/or makes her cry, she goes ballistic.
    -   Inui, who cruelly beats his brother, Saburou, nearly constantly claims the world is too cruel for his brother, spouting, "I'm the only one allowed to hurt him!" However, this example comes out creepy as opposed to heartwarming.
-   _Ranma ½_: Ranma and Akane are one of Rumiko Takahashi's most famous fictional couples, known for their Belligerent Sexual Tension, so it's no surprise that they've insulted each other more times than you can count. But when Kodachi's rival, Asuka, calls Ranma a fool, Akane gets _pissed_ and actually has Ranma go out on a double date with Kodachi and Asuka to prove how handsome and cool he really is, despite being the jealous type. She even helps dress him up and follows them on the date to make sure everything goes smoothly. Which, of course, it doesn't.
-   In _Rent-A-Girlfriend_, Kazuya and Chizuru don't get off on the right foot, and she spends most of the early series annoyed with him, although she does have some sympathy for him. However, when they meet Kazuya's ex-girlfriend Mami at a mixer, and Mami begins insulting Kazuya, Chizuru gets visibly angry as she objects to Mami's behavior, surprising Kazuya.
-   Shannon Casull teases his little sister Pacifica mercilessly in _Scrapped Princess_, but he literally swears to oppose God Himself in her defence, even if it means the destruction of the world.
-   _Touch (1981)_: In the first chapter, Minami gets angry because her friends are dissing Tetsuya. When they remind her that she constantly complains about Tetsuya, Minami replies it is different when _she_ does it (justified because her friends were just mocking him; Minami berates him because she knows he is _not_ a useless idiot but he wants everyone thinking he is).
-   A rather dark version of this happens in _X1999_. Despite murdering Subaru's beloved sister Hokuto as well as constantly trying to kill Subaru himself, Seishiro gives Subaru one of his eyes upon his death to replace the one he lost to Fuuma/Dark Kamui. The reason given is that he didn't want a mark left on Subaru that he himself didn't make.
-   In one episode of _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_, Professor Chronos vehemently defends the Osiris Dorm from Napoleon, and then chews him out thoroughly for insulting them, yelling, "You had the nerve to call my worthless student worthless! Only _I_ can insult those slackers!" This is the point where he goes from a reluctant ally of the protagonists to a full-fledged one.

    Asian Animation 

-   In _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: Mighty Little Defenders_ episode 36, Wolnie protects Wolffy from the wolf duo Rolly and Raoul, who are seeking to turn him in for money. Wolnie tells them that, to paraphrase, "nobody can mess with Wolffy except for me!". Wolnie has abused Wolffy for not capturing the goats _a lot_ throughout the series, primarily in the earlier seasons.

    Comic Books 

-   In an _Archie Comics_ story, Mr. Lodge and Smithers feel sorry for Betty over how mean Veronica often is to her. Hoping to prevent further hurt, they conspire to make Betty think that Veronica is shunning her. After setting the devastated Betty straight, Veronica furiously castigates her father and butler for what they've done: "If you can't insult your best friend, who _can_ you insult? But not you! Me!"
-   _Batman and Robin (2009)_: "Nobody gets to kill my family but me." A darker take on this, because a.) this is coming from Victor Zsasz, who probably isn't kidding, and b.) he's talking to somebody who already _did_ kill his brother.
-   _Challengers of the Unknown_: The 48th issue of the original series, which crosses over with the Doom Patrol, has Negative Man split up a squabble between "Rocky" Davis and Robotman.
    
    **Negative Man:** Hold it, chum! That's my buddy you're pushing around!  
    **Robotman:** Why, Larry! I didn't know you still cared!  
    **Negative Man:** Sure! Nobody's gonna rap your corrugated cranium...except me!
    
-   _Fantastic Four_:
    -   A recurring trope for the Thing — he will constantly threaten, shove around, fight with, and even beat up the Human Torch, but the moment anyone _else_ lays a finger on him, Ben will exclaim "no one hits Matchstick but me!" and will not stop until the villain has been pummeled thoroughly. Johnny Storm reciprocates similarly — he is constantly making fun of and playing cruel pranks on the Thing while showing little to no sensitivity about his monstrous appearance, but will furiously leap to his defense if anyone _else_ hurts Ben's feelings.
    -   Throughout most of the Fantastic Four's history, the Thing was harassed and teased by his former gang on Yancy Street who tended to call him a "sell-out"; however, they often helped him and the rest of his team if a villain was giving them trouble on their turf, claiming "that's our job" on such occasions. (They really didn't mean it, anyway.) They also spent much of _FF_ being _genuinely outraged_ that some singer in an old Thing exoskeleton was replacing _their_ Ben Grimm.
-   The Marvel Universe crossover _Maximum Security_ features U.S. Agent, now working for a Cape Busters force called S.T.A.R.S., co-opting The Avengers, and being his usual abrasive self, utterly contemptuous of these so-called heroes. In the end, when he rejects Cap's offer of friendship, one of his S.T.A.R.S. colleagues says "You told 'em, sir. Who do they think they are?" and gets slammed against the side of their aircraft. You do _not_ talk like that about the Avengers to U.S. Agent.
-   In one of the Expanded Universe _Overwatch_ comics focusing on Junkrat and Roadhog, Junkrat is seen constantly insulting Roadhog for being fat, but as soon as one cop tells another to "keep an eye on the fat one", Junkrat immediately flies into a rage.
    
    **Junkrat:** _DID YOU JUST CALL MY FRIEND **FAT**, YOU PIG?!_
    
-   In _The Sandman (1989)_, Cain goes absolutely berserk when the Kindly Ones kill Abel. Abel dies a lot of times in the series, always killed by Cain, of course. Abel also takes the event very badly judging by his last words, since it's not like he _likes_ Cain killing him on a near-constant basis, but that's the way their story has always gone. When the Kindly Ones do it he gets upset, exclaiming that they don't even know him.
-   In _Secret Wars (1984)_, one of Marvel's first Crisis Crossovers, tensions rise between the X-Men and the other Marvel heroes out of distrust (though most of them have worked with the X-Men in the past at least once, so they really should have known better). When Hawkeye gets in Cyclops's face, Wolverine cuts in and says, "Cyclops might be a jerk, but he's _our_ jerk!"
-   _Spider-Man_: J. Jonah Jameson is a very loud and very verbally abusive boss to the Daily Bugle staff, but that is his right as the Editor and Chief. On the many occasions the Bugle has been attacked (more than one villain has realized that the Bugle's great pictures of Spider-Man mean someone there is friendly with the web head), if ol' JJJ isn't mouthing off to the supervillain, it's because he was home sick with laryngitis, thus preventing him from phoning in and giving the bad guy a verbal beat down for threatening his staff. This is largely due to J. Jonah Jameson having a background as an investigative journalist: He had to drop many a story when his editors got calls from the very people he was investigating and forced Jameson to back off. Now that he's the editor, he actually views a threat because one of his reporters was ticking off a person with power so much, they were resorting to threats to the paper as a badge of honor for that reporter. Doesn't matter if the power is political or super, J. Jonah Jameson is going to turn all of his bluster against the villain and in support of his reporter... often with the reporter in the room at that time (and because he was being chewed out by JJ for something... JJ will yell because that particular day of the week ends with a "y", so the chewing out of the employee might not be warranted).
-   In _Watchmen_ for as unpleasantly dismissive as Rorschach was of the Attempted Rape the Comedian (a superhero he idolises) pulled on Sally Jupiter in the past, much to her daughter Laurie’s anger, he absolutely despises sexual predators and actively saves women from being assaulted on the streets at night.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   The first sign of Wolverine mellowing from Jerk With A Heart Of Jerk to Jerk with a Heart of Gold is when a demon attacks the X-Mansion (long story) and insults Nightcrawler. Logan, who only a few pages prior had tried to outright _murder_ Kurt for laughing at him, tears into the demon on the grounds that the elf is his buddy.
    -   _X-Men Red (2022)_ has a tremendous example of this with Magneto. As anyone who’s familiar with Marvel knows Magneto despises humanity, considering them no more “wolves” and ever since helping establish Krakoa is happy at the idea of slowly ousting and replacing mankind as the superior species. Yet as revealed the person Magneto actually loved the most in the whole world isn’t Wanda or Lorna, but Anya his first daughter **who is 100% human**. When Erik learns that Wanda’s Eldritch Orchid cannot bring his non-mutant daughter back, he breaks down crying in despair.

    Comic Strips 

-   Inverted: When _Beetle Bailey_ hears that Sergeant Snorkel has beaten up a private from another company, he becomes outraged and tries to report him for infidelity.
-   _Blondie (1930)_: Nobody except Dagwood's Mean Boss Mr. Dithers is allowed to yell at, kick, fire, or otherwise abuse Dagwood, period. Dithers has been known to resort to violence to enforce that rule.
-   In an early strip of _For Better or for Worse_, Michael roughs up a friend of his who made Elizabeth cry, saying, "No one makes my baby sister cry except me!"
-   A June 12, 1981 strip of _Garfield_ had Garfield smack into next week a cat that beat up on Odie, claiming "No one beats up Odie but me!"

    Fan Works 

-   Many (if not most) _Fairly Oddparents_ fics that feature Timmy/Vicky have Vicky defending Timmy because only she's allowed to make him miserable.
-   _221B_: "Boswells Unite!" features Watson receiving a letter from the Strand informing him they're not printing any more of his stories for the moment because someone has been sending in "gutter-press" under his name. Holmes fumes that only he can criticize Watson's writing, and whoever this is has gone even further by blackening his reputation. He immediately sets out to find the perpetrator and teach him a lesson.
-   _Advice and Trust_: When Shinji loses a Strip Chess match against Pen Pen (long story) and becomes its butler for one month, Asuka wins him back because she will not put up with him slaving at the whims of a bird. When Misato asks if she is fine with Shinji slaving at her whims, she replies that is how it works.
    
    **Asuka:** Baka Shinji's mine, not some cheeky penguin's servant! I will not see him forced to slave at the whims of a bird!  
    **Misato:** But you're just fine with him slaving at your whims?  
    **Asuka:** Well, duh. That's the way things are supposed to go. He's mine. He belongs to me.
    
-   The _Miraculous Ladybug_ fic _The Book of Revelations_ has this exchange between Plagg and Tikki, though it turns into straight-up Hypocritical Humor by the end.
    
    **Tikki:** Look at what happened to Adrien! You told him and he immediately started acting like an... like an... _idiot_!  
    **Plagg:** Hey! Let's get one thing straight, _bugaboo_... Adrien _is_ an idiot. The fact that he failed to deduce Ladybug's identity without me screaming it at him is proof of that. But _I_ am responsible for that _idiot_ day in, day out, and _I_ am the only one who gets to call him that!  
    **Tikki:** ... Alright, I suppose that was out of line... no need to bring the kids into this—  
    **Plagg:** Besides, if _anyone_ is the idiot here, it's Marinette!  
    **Tikki:** ... _Excuse me_?  
    **Plagg:** _\[mocking imitation of Marinette's voice\]_ "Oh Chat Noir, we simply can't know each other's identities because... um... uh... oh jeez gotta go!"
    
-   In _Fates Collide_, after hearing Weiss Schnee's description of Ruby Rose, Nero insults Ruby and calls her immature. Weiss warns her only she is allowed to talk about Ruby that way.
-   _For the Glory of Irk_: At one point, Zim firmly tells off CB for silencing Skoodge, stating that only he can do that. Later, he says the same thing to Voel regarding being mean to CB.
-   _Harry Hibiki and the Philosopher's Stone_:
    
    **Kodachi:** No one calls Brother Dear an idiot except me.
    
-   Mentioned in the _South Park_ fanfic _How Cartman Stole Christmas_.
    
    Kyle was his to torment and his alone.
    
-   _Invader Zim: A Bad Thing Never Ends_: In Chapter 6, Gaz beats up Zim and the minion trio for the Tar and Feathers stunt they pulled on Dib in the previous chapter, noting that only _she_ gets to do that kind of stuff to him.
-   _The King Nobody Wanted_: Every interaction Nightmare Fetishist Barb Bracken has with her timid sister Jayne involves her reveling in making her sister miserable, up until the scene where she furiously scares away their Creepy Uncle for being even worse to Jayne than Barb usually is.
-   _Ninja Wizard Book 2_:
    
    **Sirius:** I guarantee if you asked any of \[my cousins\] if they'd be happier as an only child, they'd probably hex you.  
    **Remus:** I seem to recall you hexed James once for making a similar crack to you.  
    **Sirius:** Well, he had no call talking about Reg like that.  
    **Remus:** You used to say worse.  
    **Sirius:** Yeah, but that was me.
    
-   _Old Stories, New Discoveries_ has Marinette, after she and the rest of the class have found out Adrien's secret, furiously standing up for her partner after Chloe calls him "that mangy cat", before muttering that she's the only one who gets to call him that.
-   In _Payback is a_ Pansy hits Astoria and Daphne kidnaps and ties up Pansy as revenge.
    
    **Pansy:** Daphne? Let me go! It was her own fault! I saw her sniffing around my Draco.  
    **Daphne:** Nobody bullies my little sister except for me! Now do I need to do some permanent damage, or will you back off?
    
-   In _The Second String_, Mundungus Fletcher asks Harry if it's possible that Aberforth has a secret girlfriend.
    
    "He can 'ave me Vera!" a drunken Dalcop offered magnanimously.
    
    "Ah, everyone who's anyone already has!" retorted Martial Sorner.
    
    Harry had cursed them all as he mopped up the puddle from the tankard Dalcop had emptied over Martial's head for that one. Apparently Dalcop could say whatever he wanted about his wife, but no one else better dare to.
    
-   Arthur is often rude to Merlin in _The Student Prince_, but he gets protective when Lady Viva acts rudely to Merlin, promptly turning her down and shutting her out of their room.
-   From the _Death Note_ AU _Those Who Stand for Nothing Fall for Anything_:
    
    **L:** No one takes the piss out of Light apart from me.
    
-   In _Truthfully_, nobody is allowed to beat up on the Avengers without Loki's permission, nor without following his rules pertaining to it. God help you if you try actually killing any of them.
-   _The Vanishing Cabinet of Time_:
    
    **Fred:** Who poisoned \[Ron\]?  
    **George:** One of the Slytherins? We'll hex him. Nobody messes with our brother.  
    **Fred/George:** Except for us!
    
-   _You've Cast A Spell Over Me, Nope, Just A Hex_:
    
    "Potter, Potter, always trying to play the hero," Draco smirked, although he felt an odd tug of something like possession somewhere in his stomach. No one else should hex Potter - that was _his_ job.
    

    Films — Animation 

-   _Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker_ sees the Joker unintentionally invoke this. As part of his Villainous Breakdown, he screams at Terry McGinnis that he isn't Batman.

-   Throughout most of _Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show_, the Kanker Sisters are hunting down and capturing the other kids for having the temerity to even try and harm the Eds. At the end, they're also outright disgusted at Eddy's brother for beating on them and drag him into his trailer to give him some of their infamous "attention".
    
    **Marie:** Ain't no one beating up on my man but me!  
    _(Later in the final minutes, when they see Eddy’s Brother beating up Eddy…)_  
    **Lee:** WHAT’S HE DOIN' TO MY MAN?!
    
-   In _Rise of the Guardians_, Bunnymund has no qualms mocking Jack about his lack of believers. But the moment Pitch does the same thing, Bunny _immediately_ tries to attack him for it.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Romantic variation in _The Addams Family_ (although given the nature of Gomez and Morticia's relationship, this is open to interpretation):
    
    **Morticia:** Don't torture yourself, dear. That's my job.
    
-   The scene from _Animal House_ where Neidermeyer is riding roughshod on Flounder in ROTC training:
    
    **Otter:** He can't do that to our pledges!  
    **Boon:** Only we can do that to our pledges.
    
-   _The Court Jester_: Gwendolyn repeatedly threatens her handmaiden Griselda. However, when her father threatens Griselda, Gwendolyn says that she'll throw herself out the window if he tries it.
-   _Forrest Gump_: Lieutenant Dan is constantly abrasive towards Forrest, verbally abusing him at every turn in a "George and Lennie" fashion. However, he completely loses his cool when a pair of escorts he's invited over to celebrate New Year's with begin calling Forrest "stupid" and immediately tells them to get lost.
-   Invoked in the live-action _Garfield_ film. When the evil pet owner, Happy Chapman, tortures Odie with a shock collar, Garfield is visibly disgusted by Chapman's actions.
    
    **Garfield:** Poor Odie. He faces a life of torture, neglect, and degradation. Hey, nobody gets to mistreat my dog like that except me!
    
-   In _The Goonies_, there is a deleted scene where the bully Troy is going to punch Mikey when Brand stops him, saying, "Nobody hits my brother except me."
-   In the film adaptation of _The Great Gilly Hopkins_, the eponymous character picks on her younger foster brother, William Earnest, constantly but immediately intervenes when he's targeted by bullies at school. She claims that it's because she wants picking on William Earnest to be her sole purview, but it's actually the first hint that she's beginning to care despite herself. (In later scenes, after Gilly has pretty much stopped picking on him altogether, she teaches him how to fight back against the bullies.)

-   A subtle but particularly heartwarming example in the _Iron Man_ films with in regard to Tony’s hilariously incompetent hydraulic arms Dum-E and U. Tony constantly complains about them while building suits in his workshop and has even threatened to send Dum E to a city college if he keeps messing up. Yet when his Malibu mansion is destroyed and all his tech scattered in the ocean in _Iron Man 3_, Tony pointedly only recovers and fixes Dum E and _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ reveals he kept Dum E with him in Stark Tower until his death whereupon it was passed on to Peter. Despite having poor AI Dum E and U clearly held a dear place in Tony’s heart as his first creations (who saved his life in the first movie) despite Tony acting like he doesn’t care about them. He never reprogrammed or upgraded them either.
-   In _Joyful Noise_, Olivia gets angry at her boyfriend Randy for calling her mom the Wicked Witch of the West, even though she's used worse insults.
-   In _Mean Girls_:
    
    **Janis:** This is Damian. He's almost too gay to function.
    

Cady innocently repeats this to the Plastics, then follows it up by thinking "Uh-oh. Maybe it's only okay when Janis says that." And then later:

**Damian:** _\[outraged\]_ Too gay to function?  
**Janis:** It's only okay when I say that!

-   In _Money Train_, Wesley Snipes's character will be the first to call his adopted brother a fuck up... but god help anyone else who does it in front of him.

He even angrily says to his adopted brother that he "keeps fucking up" rather than that he "is a fuck-up" when his adopted brother admits he is one.
-   _Prom Wars_: Hamish is one of the only jocks at the Selby school (due to being a legacy) and can be a Jerk Jock at times. But after the Lancaster boys bully some of his classmates and steal their pants, Hamish angrily says that no one can do that to Selby students except him.
-   _Shaolin Soccer_: The monks are all creeped out by Mui's new, bizarre look and make jokes that she's a ghost. When Mui's overbearing boss arrives and insults her appearance, the monks all rush to her defense and castigate the employer, saying that she looks beautiful.
-   In _Spider-Man_, J. Jonah Jameson is, as always, intensely critical of Peter Parker's photos, tries to shortchange him whenever he can, and is just generally a caustic ass. But when the Green Goblin comes asking for the photographer to take Spider-Man's photos, Jameson immediately makes up an excuse that he doesn't know who he is and that the photos come unmarked in the mail in order to protect Peter.

    Literature 

-   There's a children's poem by Agniya Barto where the narrator says how he'll never allow anyone to hurt his little sister Lida. It concludes with: "If necessary — I can beat her up myself!"
-   Bindy from _Being Bindy_ complains about her mum all the time, but when Janey calls her a bitch, Bindy is offended.
    
    **Bindy:** It's up to me to say, not you. I don't say mean things about your mum.  
    **Janey:** What's to say? My mum is nice.
    
-   _Brotherband_:
    -   Ulf and Wulf make a constant habit of bickering with and insulting each other, but let anyone else make a move on one, and his twin will immediately come to the rescue.
    -   In _Slaves of Soccorro_, Ulf and Wulf are gleeful at Ingvar playing the part of the slave during the Herons' reconnaissance mission, as Ingvar usually disciplines them when they act up too much. However, when the slavers take Ingvar for real, they're adamant about getting him back.
-   In _A Brother's Price_, Corelle has lots of complaints regarding her brother Jerin. He talks too posh, he doesn't wear the right clothes... but when some woman dares imply that Jerin would be _lucky_ if a noblewoman like her would deign to marry him, Corelle is enraged. Justified in that this is an insult to (the social standing of) the whole family, but it's also clear that Corelle won't let someone outside the family insult her brother.
-   In _Castle Hangnail_, Molly and Sarah can't be in the same room for five minutes straight without discord, but woe betide anybody who mocks Sarah in Molly's hearing. "Nobody calls my twin stupid but me!"
-   A classic example, mixed heavily with UST, is Taran and Eilonwy's relationship in _The Chronicles of Prydain_. Just one instance occurs in the second book when Taran is telling Eilonwy to Stay in the Kitchen. Prince Ellidyr comes in and has the temerity to _agree_ with Taran, which sets him off, and he lectures Ellidyr on how Eilonwy has already survived great dangers and befriended Prince Gwydion himself, while Ellidyr's never done much of anything.
-   The book series _Cut and Run_ has main characters Ty and Zane insult and annoy each other and, as a trigger for beginning a romantic (but dysfunctional) relationship, attack each other in a full-blown physical brawl, Ty even attempting to break Zane's nose. The rest of the series involves the two defending each other from various antagonists while consistently pissing each other off.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   In the Witches series, the many branches of the Ogg family are locked in a never-ending, complicated feud, but if one member ever hears a stranger badmouth a member of the family, then the Oggs will forget their differences and unite to punish the troublemaker.
    -   **Vimes:** Detritus is not my property. If I don't need a passport, neither does he.  
        **Detritus:** You know, if it's gonna be a problem, I don't mind—  
        **Vimes:** Shut up, Detritus. You are a free citizen of Anhk-Morpork. That is an order.
        
    -   Archchancellor Ridcully has a similar view to his people.
        
        **Ridcully:** How dare you, sir! Continue, Mr. Collabone!  
        **Collabone:** I, I, I—  
        **Ridcully:** That is an order, Dr. Collabone!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
        
    -   Carrot interprets Vimes's feelings about Vetinari as more or less this (kind of straddling the fine line between this trope and The Only One Allowed to Defeat You):
        
        **Carrot:** I think he's got a sort of soft spot for the Patrician, in his way. He once said that if anyone was going to kill Vetinari he'd like it to be him.
        
    -   Vimes even feels this way about Ankh-Morpork itself:
        
        **Vimes:** Listen, if anyone ever sets fire to this city, it's going to be me.
        
    -   Another collective example for Vimes: One of the books has him infuriated at a party of human nobles for making speciesist remarks against trolls and dwarfs. His wife points out to him that he insults trolls and dwarfs all the time. Vimes's response is, essentially, that _he_ is allowed to, because _he_ spends his days surrounded by trolls and dwarfs and therefore knows for a fact that most of them are bastards, while the nobles are just being ignorant bigots.
    -   Annagramma Hawkin may treat Tiffany Aching like a spot of dirt that happened to be beneath her nose, but when the literal personification of all of winter, who is powerful enough to create an avalanche or snowstorm in a split second, harasses Tiffany, she stomps up to him as if he were no-one more than Bob from the coffee shop, yells at him to leave her alone, and chucks a fireball at him. She succeeds in melting him, albeit temporarily.
-   _The Fort (2022)_: A Moral Myopia version occurs when Marcus learns that Luke and Jaeger have been following and threatening his stepson C.J. He goes ballistic and nearly strangles Jaeger to death. It would be an awesome (albeit terrifying) Papa Wolf if not for the fact that Marcus has been abusing C.J. for years, almost on a daily basis, and has sent him to the hospital multiple times.
-   In _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_, Ron ends up getting detention from Professor Snape, after criticizing Snape for calling Hermione a know-it-all when she answers a question. It is mentioned that everyone in class has called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron calls Hermione a know-it-all about twice a week. But they all understand that it's far worse when a teacher does it.
-   The picture book _Julius the Baby of the World_ by Kevin Henkes is built around this trope: The jealous older sister, Lily, comes to terms with her new baby brother when she hears her cousin insult him and springs to his defense.
-   Only _Junie B. Jones_ is allowed to criticize Mrs. Miller-Jones's cooking.
-   In _Myth Directions_, Skeeve makes a promise without thinking, immensely complicating the book's plot. His master Aahz has plenty to say about it, but when somebody else makes the same point, Aahz snarls at them; he's the only one who's allowed to criticize his apprentice.
-   In _The Saddle Club_, the Lake siblings fight with each other constantly, but are the first to come to each other's defense if someone outside the family messes with them and to offer support if one of them is ill or injured. This is especially true with Stevie and Alex, who have an extra layer of connection due to being twins.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   When they first meet, Jaime and Brienne refer to each other exclusively as Kingslayer and wench, respectively. Later in their relationship, he only calls her a wench when she frustrates him. In _A Feast for Crows_, after they go their separate ways, he encounters someone who knew her and has a variety of unpleasant things to say on the matter, including calling her a wench. So he punches the man out. With a metal fist, at that.
        
        **Jaime:** You are speaking of a highborn lady, ser. Call her by her name. Call her Brienne.
        
    -   Tywin Lannister and Walder Frey don't seem to have any sincere affection for their offspring, dealing out backhanded compliments and outright belittlement at every opportunity, but both of them will respond with utter ruthlessness to any outsider that dares slight a member of their families.
-   _Superheroes Anonymous_: Hostage Girl is furious when another Supervillain injures Razor X in a fight; "Raze is _my_ enemy, nobody gets to hurt her but me!" She does realize the sheer dysfunctional idiocy of this thought.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Absolutely Fabulous_, Edina and Patsy constantly belittle Edina's daughter, Saffron. Patsy goes as far as wishing Edina had an abortion, and Edina is often a bitch to Saffy. However, when Saffy reveals that the man who is coming onto her is married and she doesn't want his attention, Edina decks the man and yells, "Stay away from my daughter!"
-   In the _Adventures in Wonderland_ episode "Invasion of the Tweedle Snatchers", the Queen of Hearts says this when she thinks that the Tweedles are being mind-controlled by aliens:
    
    **Queen:** Nobody's going to tell my subjects what to think unless it's me!
    
-   In _All in the Family_, Archie is rude and uncouth, speaking down to Mike (whom he calls "Meathead") frequently, calling Edith a "Dingbat" and yelling at her, and getting into nasty verbal conflicts with his neighbor George. But if _anyone_ else insults them, there'll be hell to pay.

-   _The A-Team_: Although it's never expressly stated, it's pretty obvious that B.A. is the only one who's allowed to be mean to Murdock and Face. He frequently verbally abuses them and threatens them with physical violence (Murdock is his main target, but Face gets quite a bit of this too, at times). And then you'll get a scene where the team is facing the slimeballs of the week; Murdock and Face, the physically weaker half of the team, frequently find themselves fighting a mook who's too big for them to handle. Cue B.A., who proceeds to knock the sucka's lights out. Five minutes later he's back to insulting Murdock and Face and threatening to beat them up himself. Happens every few episodes.
-   _Black Books_ has a half-dying Bernard (having had to look after himself for a whole day) snap out of it when he hears that his Chew Toy Manny is being bullied by his new boss. "How _dare_ you? Don't you touch a hair on that boy's head! Have you no respect? He's mine! Get your _own_ human plaything, you quartz-brained little cream puff!"
-   On _Blake's 7_, despite claiming to despise Vila, when Avon finds out that Tarrant is likely to get him killed, Avon threatens to _kill him_.
-   In one _Bones_ episode, Booth is watching Cam argue with her sister. When the sister turns on him, he raises his voice at her, and Cam snaps at him and the two leave for lunch while Cam comments that he needs to calm down.
-   _The Boys (2019)_: Billy Butcher invokes this frequently, he has an (admittedly understandable) very vocal and active hatred of Supes and people with superpowers. Yet with the baby with Eye Beams, he gave the infant a kiss on head and gently put the child back in their cot after using them to laser some Vought mooks apart. He also comes to love the superpowered Ryan his wife’s Becca Child by Rape after being assaulted by his Arch-Enemy Homelander, and willingly betrays his deal with Soldier Boy out of his love for Ryan.
-   In _Charité at War_, Professor Ferdinand Sauerbruch acts like this to the entire staff of his hospital ward: He can belittle them and yell at them however he pleases, but if someone else disrespects one of his students or employees, Sauerbruch puts the fear of God into them.
-   On _Cheers_, Harry the Hat shows up frequently to swindle money out of the patrons and staff of the bar, but at times, he helps them out, partly out of sentiment, and partly to protect them from operators and crooks even more unscrupulous than himself, noting, "I don't like the idea of someone else plucking my pigeons."
-   Gareth's Establishing Character Moment in _Chef! (1993)_ is him delivering an epic rant to his subordinates, making it clear that he's Surrounded by Idiots, and then leaving the kitchen to deliver an even _more_ epic rant to a customer for denigrating the work of these highly-trained and hard-working professionals.
-   _Clarissa Explains It All_:
    -   In one episode, Ferguson becomes a victim of the school bully, and Clarissa stands up for him saying, "He's my brother. If anyone's going to clobber him, it's going to be me!"
    -   In another episode, Ferguson gets a new rich friend who Clarissa discovers is her secret admirer and is only using Ferguson to get to her. When trying to figure out how to tell Ferguson gently, Clarissa declares, "I don't want him crushed, only slightly dented!"
-   _Community_:
    -   Jeff declares that "Greendale is our toilet, and no one craps in it but us!" at one point to get the rest of the study group riled up to save the day.
    -   The study group declaring Britta "the worst" or otherwise making fun of her is very common, but when Mr. Rad, the glee club teacher, yells it at her, the entire group snaps out of their gleeful musical haze to defend her.
        
        **Jeff:** Hey!  
        **Troy:** You do _not_ get to call Britta the worst!
        
    -   Jeff may dislike the Dean, but he takes action after finding out that he's been kidnapped.
-   _The Dick Van Dyke Show_: In "A Day in the Life of Alan Brady", Millie considers Alan Brady a "rat" because he called Jerry "dumbo" when he finished an old joke Alan was telling. She insists that only she can call Jerry that. Of course, this doesn't stop her from wanting him at the party when it turns out the event will be televised.
-   Megan does this on two occasions in _Drake & Josh_:
    -   In the first, she helps acquit Drake of a prank he didn't commit, and when Drake asks why she's helping him, Megan replies, "Because you're my brother, and I can tell you're sad and scared and upset, and I can't stand to see you that way... unless I cause it."
    -   In the second, Megan initially doesn't like Mindy before she becomes Josh's girlfriend because she makes him miserable... and that's Megan's job.
-   In _Even Stevens_, Ren never hesitates to call Louis an idiot. However, after failing a band audition (big time), the guy judging it calls Louis an idiot. Ren then tells him that the only person allowed to call him an idiot is her.
-   There's an episode of _Everybody Loves Raymond_ where Ray ends up in a rivalry against Peggy, the obnoxious den mother of the Frontier Girls troop that Ray's daughter is a member of (to elaborate, Peggy has a history of bullying the other scouts' parents—to the point where they're terrified of her—in order to get choice spots to sell cookies, thus guaranteeing that she herself will win the top prizes). Ray is apparently the first parent to stand up to her, and she reacts by trying to pull his sales table away from him in public and push him onto the ground. Ray's wife Debra shows up and tells Peggy to back off. At first one is inclined to think that Debra, who usually bullies and physically abuses Ray a lot herself, is going to finally redeem herself... but then as soon as Peggy is out of sight, Debra goes back to bullying Ray, and starts sneering at him (and in later episodes such as "A Date for Peter", she uses the events of this episode to make fun of him in public). Apparently, she doesn't really object to Ray being bullied... she merely objects to _someone else_ bullying him, because she apparently views him as being her property (emphasized when she tells Peggy "if you've got a problem, you bring it up with me" as if Ray isn't his own person, and is merely just one of her possessions).
-   _Family Matters_:
    -   In one episode, Laura dumps a boyfriend because he starts making fun of her brother the same way she does.
    -   She also blasts anyone who dares to badmouth Urkel, despite the fact that she herself can't stand him most of the time.
    -   Eddie will fight with Laura, but his protectiveness of her is more Big Brother Instinct.

-   _Firefly_:
    -   Mal calls Inara a whore all the time. But he's also the first to defend her if anyone else calls her (or implies that she is) a whore. He later states that while he loathes and insults her job, he's not insulting the woman herself and actively tries to protect her professional reputation (just never to her face). On the other hand, the person who triggered his Hypocritical Heartwarming was treating Inara herself (instead of her job) like a whore, and even a slave. And mutually, their Volleying Insults can range from overprotectiveness, a defensive mechanism against rejection, or just an act to annoy each other.
    -   Jayne is typically a bullying jerkass to the crew, outright saying he doesn’t give a shit about them and Only in It for the Money. In the first episode he humiliates Kaylee at the dinner table when she’s crushing on the handsome doctor Simon (making a gynaecologist joke). However when Kaylee is shot, Jayne is seen perching by the infirmary window like a child clearly terrified for Kaylee’s life. Also for a man who supposedly only cares about himself, someone Taking the Bullet for him causes Jayne to have a massive Freak Out. He’s also proudly pervertedly lustful towards attractive women and a fan of torture, yet openly states his disgust the rape and mutilation the Reavers perform.
-   While Frasier Crane from _Frasier_ will happily mock, belittle, and humiliate his little brother Niles all day long, he hates Niles's wife Maris with a burning passion because of _her_ abusive treatment of her husband. Occasionally expressed by Frasier encouraging Niles to stand up for himself, and then yelling at him and bossing him around while telling him precisely how to do so.
-   _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_: Will picks on Carlton all the time and has made quite a few jokes about him being too "white", but he is quick to defend him against anyone who puts him down.
-   _Friends_: Occasionally Monica about Chandler. Like when they're having photos taken.
    
    **Monica:** Chandler, what is wrong with your face? It's meant to say "Geller and Bing to be Married", not "Local Woman Saves Drowning Moron!"  
    **Photographer:** _\[laughs\]_  
    **Monica:** Hey! Don't laugh at him, he's _my_ drowning moron.  
    **Chandler:** _\[smiles\]_
    
-   In _Game of Thrones_, Tywin Lannister despises his son Tyrion, yet refuses to tolerate anyone else mocking or harming him. This has nothing to do with Tyrion and everything to do with the fact that anyone who wrongs him is defying the power and authority of House Lannister, which Tywin will not allow.
    
    **Tywin:** He's a Lannister! Maybe the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us. And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect.  
    **Tyrion:** _\[lukewarmly\]_ Kind of you to go to war for me.
    
-   _House of the Dragon_: Daemon Targaryen pisses off his older brother Viserys and criticizes him on a regular basis, but he won't allow _anyone_ to speak ill of him.

**Corlys Velaryon:** I will not have Driftmark beggared while our king idles himself with feasts and balls and tourneys!

**Daemon:** I will speak of my brother as I wish. You will not.

-   _Glee_:
    -   Rachel is tricked by her boyfriend Jesse into getting egged by Vocal Adrenaline — genuinely upsetting for Rachel, since 1) she's a vegan and 2) Jesse took the opportunity to break up with her. The boys from New Directions immediately mobilize to go kick Vocal Adrenaline's asses — including Kurt, who angrily insists that "Rachel is one of us! _We're_ the only ones who get to humiliate her."
    -   In one episode, all the Glee guys, even the ones who used to bully Kurt, defend him in front of Karofsky.
-   On _Home Improvement_, Brad and Randy say that anyone who calls Mark a dork for wearing glasses will have to answer to them because they are the only ones allowed to call him a dork.
-   In the _Inspector Lynley_ pilot "A Great Deliverance", the fiery, sarcastic Detective Sergeant Havers — who doesn't even _like_ her partner DI Lynley at this point — immediately takes offense at the accusations leveled against him by an old partner of Lynley's, with whom he had parted on rather unfriendly terms. And she does this while conveniently ignoring the fact that, just hours earlier, she had been levelling those same accusations at him. This proves to be an excellent indicator of their future relationship.
-   _Jessie_:
    
    **Mrs Chesterfeild:** These revolting children were in my house?! How repugnant!  
    **Bertram:** Hey! Nobody calls these kids revolting and repugnant except _me_!
    
-   In _Kamen Rider Build_, Ryuga Banjo has two instances:
    -   Don't insult Sento Kiryu. It doesn't matter if your insult is valid. It's the intent that counts. Only he can call him out on his crap because he aims for Sento to realize the pitfalls of his logic/actions/whatever, not to hurt him.
    -   Only he can be a (minor) jerk to Misora Isurugi, mostly because he doesn't want to openly admit that he cares about her. Everyone else will pay for hurting her.
-   _Legends of Tomorrow_: In the episode "Zari", there's this wonderful exchange between Mick and Ray:
    
    **Mick:** If anyone's gonna kill Haircut, it's gonna be me, lady!  
    **Ray:** _\[touched\]_ Oh, thanks, Mick!  
    **Mick:** My pleasure.
    
-   _Leverage_ features this with Vitriolic Best Buds Eliot and Hardison. When the Villain of the Week tries to throw Hardison off the roof:
    
    **Eliot:** Nobody throws Hardison off a roof. Except maybe me.
    
-   _Life with Derek_: The title character, Derek Venturi, makes this clear in "Don't Take a Tip from Me": _nobody_ is allowed to make fun of Casey and talk to her so rudely except for him.
-   _Malcolm in the Middle_:
    -   Reese mocks and beats up Malcolm and bullies Dewey all the time, but if anyone _else_ calls them names or tries to pick on them, he takes it as his duty to kick the offender's ass in retaliation.
    -   None of the kids get along too well with their mother Lois, but the entire family engages in an epic Curbstomp Battle against a clown troop because one of the clowns calls Lois fat to Hal's face. Lois, who for the entire episode has been trying to curb all the boys' bad behavior, can only look on as if the boys had just bought her a dozen red roses each to apologize while "You Light Up My Life" plays over the whole scene.
    -   In a later episode while the kids generally enjoy seeing Lois get taken down a peg when the Obnoxious In-Laws drive her to tears, they all immediately step up to get revenge on them.

-   In _Man Like Mobeen_, Uncle Shady, who regularly demeans Mobeen, comes to the latter's defense during a meeting with a prospective spouse and in-law:
    
    **Brother Ahmed:** You, Mobeen Deen, are scum of the bloody earth!  
    **Uncle Shady:** You, Mr. Ahmed, you are the biggest arsehole.  
    **Brother Ahmed:** I beg your pardon.  
    **Uncle Shady:** Nobody speaks to Mobeen like this except me.  
    **Mobeen:** Thanks and that, but I'd prefer if you didn't speak to me like that as well.
    
-   _Married... with Children_:
    -   Al's attitude towards Peg is indifferent at best and rather insulting at worst; however, he has been known to react with violence towards anyone who insults or makes any indecent moves towards her.
    -   Bud and Kelly show this too, fighting each other like Cain and Abel most of the time, Bud often making fun of how easy she is while Kelly mocks his bad luck with women, but in some episodes, they protect each other vigilantly. In one where a boy tries to get fresh with Kelly, only to be kicked out of her car and sent walking home, he meets Bud and consoles with him; Bud pretends to sympathize, then hugs him, not mentioning that he had just been with a girl who had chickenpox. In another episode, Bud is set up for a Prank Date by a girl and humiliated; Kelly punishes the girl by tying her up in a school hallway wearing only a towel with Buck's leash tied to the towel (and then calling for Buck as she and the other students enter, at which point the end credits start).

-   _Million Yen Women_: Minami, and some of the other women to a lesser extent, tend to call Shin's novels bad. However, when a _literary critic_ does the same thing, be it via a magazine article or to Shin's face while the women are present, the women get mad at him and ask what right he has to denigrate Shin's work.
-   In _Mystery Science Theater 3000_, visiting circus conman PT Mindslap offers to buy Jonah and the Bots off of Kinga and Max. They refuse on the grounds that they see through his scam (there is no actual circus performance and they'd be slaves in the kitchens) and if anyone is going to exploit them, it's Kinga.
-   On _NCIS_, pretty much the whole team can be like this. It is part of what makes them True Companions. For example, Tony gets to insult McGee. You don't get to insult McGee. Tony does. _Not you._
-   One episode of _Outlander_ has Claire joining some MacKenzie men on a rent-collecting tour and constantly getting insulted and belittled by them along the way. Towards the end of the episode, when she's patching them up after a tavern brawl, it turns out that the brawl was caused by some other men insulting Claire's honour and all of them jumping to her defense. They explain that she is a guest of their Laird, so _they_ can insult her all they want, but for anyone else to do it is a slight against the MacKenzie clan as a whole.
-   In _The Phil Silvers Show_, Sgt. Bilko spends much of his time tricking and conning his men and colleagues. Should anyone else try to fleece them, however, Bilko will come down on the grifters like the wrath of god, usually with an elaborate scheme to turn the tables on them.
-   _Reba_: In the episode "Sister Act", Kyra gets suspended for punching a girl who called Cheyenne a slut, even though Kyra pokes fun at Cheyenne's Teen Pregnancy all the time. Though it later turns out to be a subversion. When Reba, Brock, and Barbra Jean head down to the school to contest the suspension, Kyra admits that she wasn't defending Cheyenne nor is it her place to do so. She only punched the girl because she was tired of being bullied for Cheyenne's mistakes and wanted an excuse to get out of school for a while.
-   _Red Dwarf_:
    
    -   Lister has a great moment of this when acting as a defence witness for Rimmer in “Justice”.
    
    **Kryten**: Now, sir, if you can give an honest answer. You are under polygraphic surveillance. Would you describe the accused as a friend?
    
    **Lister**: No, I describe the accused as a git.
    
    **Kryten**: Who would you say, then, is the person who thinks of him most fondly?
    
    **Lister**: (thinks about it, and answers truthfully) I do.
    
    -   Rimmer likewise frequently considers and dubs Lister a waste of space, yet as early as “Confidence and Paranoia” was extremely panicked when Lister collapsed in the corridor and tried to get the Cat (before he Took a Level in Kindness) to help him pick Lister up.
    -   The Cat himself similar to Rimmer has a It's All About Me attitude and claims he doesn’t care about Lister and the others. But in the episodes like “D.N.A” he explicitly tries to help Lister get out of a Containment Field and in “Out of Time” is horrified at the idea of the crew forgetting he exists.
-   The entire Reno Sheriffs Department on _Reno 911!_ will frequently make fun of Dept. Weigel and, at times, will play some rather cruel pranks on her, but they're also very protective of her, and will go after anyone whom they see as a potential threat to her safety (considering that she's usually not competent enough to see the threat herself).
-   _Scrubs_:
    -   While Cox is _always_ insulting and belittling JD and Elliot, he smacks down any strangers who try to do the same thing and consistently defends them against Kelso. However, he doesn't care when their other superiors torment them (or in JD's case, the Janitor).
    -   It's a running gag that Dr. Kelso is constantly complaining about how disappointed he is with his (never-seen) son. In one episode, Dr. Cox chips in some mockery, and Kelso is immediately enraged.
        
        **Cox:** All I remember is we were both making fun of our kids, and bam, he stuck me with Ted.  
        **Jordan:** No, you made fun of your kid, he made fun of his kid... and then _you_ made fun of _his_ kid.
        
-   In _Shadowhunters_, Simon and Raphael rarely get along, and Simon hates being a vampire, but the second a werewolf shoves Simon, Raphael and the other vampires immediately jump to his defense.
-   _Sherlock_:
    
    **Mycroft:** Oh, shut up, Mrs. Hudson!  
    **Sherlock and John**: _\[in unison, outraged\]_ Mycroft!  
    **Mycroft:** Apologies.  
    **Mrs. Hudson:** Thank you.  
    **Sherlock:** _\[to Mrs. Hudson\]_ Though do, in fact, shut up.
    
-   _Stranger Things_:
    -   Nancy openly thinks her brother Mike’s D&D sessions are stupid and lame. Yet apparently she’s participated in them and dressed up as a elf while playing it in the past.
    -   Steve has a shallow distaste and bafflement for nerdy and unfashionable things and people and has little patience for stuff outside the cultural norm. Except he becomes bosom buddies with both Dustin and Robin two of the biggest dorky and unfashionable outcasts in Hawkins and is very protective of them.
    -   Eddie from Season 4 gets on the canteen table to publicly rag on the social elite of Hawkins High and their forced conformity, considering them all snobs and assholes.

She's not fat." Subverted a few seconds later when she whispers to Chell that she _is_ adopted, And That's Terrible, and that she's only defending Chell to annoy Wheatley, because his insults, while technically the same thing, are just crude compared to hers.

    -   Yuri also sometimes slides into this when interacting with others due to his minor Tsundere nature — as Estelle notes often, Yuri isn't good at being honest with his feelings so tends to tease and give backhanded compliments to his True Companions. But if anyone goes after his friends, he's the first one to their defence.

Simon often mocks or berates Athena for making mistakes on the case, but has no tolerance for opposing prosecutor Nahyuta Sahdmadhi making even more vicious insults against Athena, or even forcing Athena to listen to the gallery's disdain from her to cause her to have a breakdown. The distinction is that Blackquill wants Athena to do a better job defending the heir to his favorite soba shop, whereas Nahyuta wants to break Athena's spirit and cause her to lose the trial.

    This would be a lot less hypocritical and a lot more heartwarming if Jacob wasn't _considerably_ more of a villain than Siegfried ever was; ol' Siggy might be an insensitive racist jerk with an anger-management problem, but you don't see _him_ casually murdering people so he can play with Animate Dead. Dominic loudly calls Jacob out on this fact at the time.

    -   Generally, the girls are like this with each other. They bicker and fight, as sisters do, but Lord help you if you try hurting one of the Puffs and are not family. They will end you.
    -   In one episode, Mojo Jojo becomes enraged that an alien villain is destroying the city and doing so many of the evil things that he wanted to do. In the end, he ends up defeating the villain, but then hates it when the townspeople praise him for being a hero.
-   _The Proud Family_: Suga Mama routinely hits and insults her son Oscar (who almost always provokes her), but in the Pro Wrestling Episode where Oscar is forced to participate in a very real wrestling match and yells at her for help, Suga Mama comes to his rescue and even says that nobody is allowed to beat Oscar up except her.
-   _The Real Ghostbusters_ gave Peter an antagonistic relationship with Slimer. However, when Samhain threatens him...
    
    **Samhain:** _\[holding Slimer\]_ Surrender your weapons, or I shall be forced to do something... _unfortunate_ to your friend.  
    **Peter:** Nobody picks on the spud but me, got it?
    
-   In _Rocket Power_, Lars doesn't like it when his cronies insult Twister. Only he can do that. It's a brother thing.
-   _Rugrats_: Angelica, as part of her Jerk with a Heart of Gold position. She might bully the babies, but she'll stand up to anyone else trying to be mean to them.
    
    **Angelica:** Nobody messes with my dumb babies 'cept me!
    
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Bart has a balanced habit of bullying and defending Lisa.
    -   In "Itchy and Scratchy Land", Homer Simpson tells a bunch of rampaging robots, "Nobody ruins my vacation except me! And maybe the boy!"
    -   A truly demented version occurs during "Treehouse of Horror IX", where Bart and Lisa are drawn into an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon due to a plutonium-powered TV-remote. They watch Itchy pull his lethal, gory assault on Scratchy, as always, and then laugh at it... but this time, the cartoon duo can hear them, and Itchy thinks they're being mean. Scratchy pulls himself together, and the two decide to teach Bart and Lisa a lesson, violent cartoon style, requiring them to run for their lives.
    -   In "The Day the Earth Stood Cool", the family is at a birthday party for a super-pretentious boy, who quickly discards the hand-painted denim jacket Homer made for him and proceeds to mock Homer, adding him to his "poser blog". Bart is so disgusted by this that he shouts, "No one badmouths my dad except me!" and fights with him.

-   _South Park_: In "Pre-School", Shelley agrees to protect Stan and his friends from Trent Boyette, saying, "No juvenile hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job."
-   _Superman: The Animated Series_: In the two-part episode "The Main Man", Lobo is introduced going after the alien Squeek. Squeek's big brother Gnaww tries to stop Lobo... because _he_ wants to take the bounty on his head, himself.
-   Eugene from _Tangled: The Series_ may not like Cassandra _at all_, but in the episode "Under Raps", he's furious when he discovers that the guy she has a crush on means her harm:
    
    **Rapunzel:** Cass will be devastated!  
    **Eugene:** Yeah, the only guy who gets to mess with Cass is me!
    
-   This is common in _Tom and Jerry_ cartoons for _both_ of them. _They_ are the _only_ ones allowed to chase, attack, and beat each other up the way they do. If _anyone_ else tries it, the other _will_ make him regret it.
-   In the _Wander over Yonder_ episode "The Cool Guy", Lord Hater relishes the chance to hang out with Emperor Awesome, but when Awesome starts picking on Commander Peepers, Hater eventually decides that he's had enough and rushes to the Commander's defense, shouting "No one picks on Peepers but me!"

    Real Life 

-   There are cases where if you bully someone's little sibling and the older sibling, however abusive they are, gets wind of it, they will beat the living crap out of you, often saying that "Only I'm allowed to beat them up/insult them."
-   This is a staple of US military culture, particularly among the infantry. Soldiers who have served together, particularly in combat, have insulting nicknames for each other and sling profanities at each other like it's going out of style, no matter how grossly offensive the terms can be (and some of these can get pretty bad). Add to that that many of these insults back and forth will be meant _sincerely_, rather than in jest, but just the same they will tend to form a unified front against outsiders, just as the different branches will (usually) put their differences aside to work together against a foreign foe. God help any outsider who tries the same thing, especially if they're from the Navy.
    
    This goes double for any military instructors, no matter how nasty they are. A guy like this will intimidate and insult the troops he trains with dirty language — because that's his job, frankly — but if _anyone_ else insults his men, he shows that guy how nasty he _really_ can be.
    
    The Marines take this to the next level, are known for being one of the most tightly-knit military organizations in existence, and will rag on each other relentlessly. But while the Marine Corps motto is Semper Fi, their fine print pretty much reads "if you fuck with _one_ of us, you'll have to deal with _all_ of us."
    
-   It's the same way with most sports teams. Team members can make fun of each other, but if _another_ team insults your teammates... Similarly, opposing player frequently trash-talk each other, but if a player gets significantly hurt, expect both teams to rally around the injured player — and they do _not_ take it well if fans make light of the injury. If the injury is particularly bad or scary, expect the entire _league_, including die-hard rival teams, to immediately send a wave of support to the injured player.
    -   In some cases, players will even intervene if one of their own teammates is being too rough with an opponent, especially if it's happening at a time when there's no actual play going on on the field.
-   Many New York Knicks fans are like this. They know their basketball team sucks. They know the team has sucked for decades, and they openly talk about it. However, they will get offended if a non-fan talks bad about their team, especially if the person is a fan of one of the rival teams.
-   Some psychological studies suggest that male characteristics most correlated with bullying are also correlated with a very strong sense of group loyalty. Which means that male bullies could be so even toward members of their own group, but also be the first to defend them against anyone else.
-   N-Word Privileges are based around this. It's okay to make fun of a group as long as you are part of it. A person foreign to that group? Better watch their back.
-   Many schools unintentionally forge this kind of camaraderie. No matter what kinds of differences or scuffles happen within it, if someone from a rival school attempts the same thing, they will put their differences aside and band together.

-   Americans are allowed to make fun of Canadians. And _only_ Americans. (At least, as far as the Americans are concerned.) As far as Canadians are concerned, however, Americans are _not_ allowed to make fun of them, though Canadians will regularly make jokes out of Canadian stereotypes.
-   Often true with residents of particular cities or states. We live here, so _we_ get to bitch about the transit system/city government/our fellow residents. But god help anybody else who tries because we will band together like the pack animals we are. See especially: New York City, and the John Rocker affair; or the quintessential example via Lewis Black.
-   _Me against my brother.  
    Me and my brother against our family.  
    Me and my family against our clan.  
    Me and my clan against our tribe.  
    Me and my tribe against the world._
-   Japan and South Korea. Japan may treat South Korea like shit, but only _they_ can do it.
-   Very common among Brazilians, who generally make fun of and complain about their country all the time, but are famously not welcoming when foreigners do it. A TV ad played with this — two Brazilians are having a conversation about their country's shortcomings, but when an Argentinian joyins in and agrees with them, they switch to saying "What are you talking about? This country's wonderful, man, there's nothing to complain about" and give him a Death Glare.
-   The Poles are the absolute masters of this trope. They can sling around insults and backbites about their fellow Poles, but if you try to get in on the joke as an outsider, well, the Poles then promptly declare Jihad! If you find yourself in a group of Poles and accidentally repeat (or worse, create) a joke about another Pole without them reacting like you've just violated one of their siblings, you know that you've finally become one of the gang.
-   According to Alice Cooper in an interview on The World Tour, both John Lennon and Paul McCartney held this attitude towards each other following the break-up of The Beatles. While Lennon's vitriol to his former bandmate and writing partner could be legendary (for one example, his particularly vicious example of The Diss Track "How Do You Sleep At Night?"), according to Cooper — who was drinking buddies with Lennon — anyone else who dared insult McCartney in Lennon's hearing would quickly face his wrath, as the former Beatle would be willing to "take a swing" at them. McCartney was similarly loyal to Lennon despite a willingness to take (somewhat milder) pot-shots, though his disdain would be expressed less violently; he would simply get up and leave the room.
