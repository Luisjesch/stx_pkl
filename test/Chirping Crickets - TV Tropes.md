Given that it's indoors, that is some VERY determined tumbleweed.

_"When I get my hands on that cricket, it's_ snack time!_"_

A character says or does something intended to elicit an enthusiastic response from a group watching him, such as the audience in a theatre or a band of comrades. But instead of the reaction he expects, he hears nothing but the sound of crickets chirping, suggesting that nobody is responding, and they may, in fact, be stunned into silence, completely baffled, or missing altogether. A Flat "What" may follow.

Occasionally visually accompanied by tumbleweed blowing past, in which case the crickets can sometimes be replaced by blowing wind, or a wolf howling in the distance, with perhaps a distant bonging church bell. Sometimes the sequence includes microphone feedback. Sometimes a single person will cough. Alternatively, someone might throw a tomato at him. Or an awkward Rimshot may play.

Basically, it's what happens when the script calls for silence but needs an audio cue to indicate the silence. Also, according to the Jabootu glossary, dubbed-in cricket sounds are a way to further convince audiences that a scene is taking place at night, regardless of how obviously Hollywood Darkness has made a day-for-night effect - even if, say, a shot of the sun might have slipped in.

In anime, this trope may be represented not by insects but by birds flying by (such as the Idiot Crows). Of course, birds can also have other symbolic meanings so don't be too quick to apply this to every appearance. More often than not, it's coupled with a Sweat Drop.

Compare Loudspeaker Truck, when a passing vehicle makes a very loud noise to indicate awkwardness.

Apparently they do that on their own when she's agitated.

        **Spike:** What's this? Sittin' around watching the telly while there's evil still afoot? It's not very industrious of you. I say we go out there and kick a little demon ass! What? Can't go without your Buffy, is that it? Too chicken? Let's find her. She is the chosen one, after all. Come on! Vampires! Grrr! Nasty!

    Crickets chirp. A distant wind blows with a mournful whoosh. A tumbleweed blows into view.  
    Y'know what? You don't like the way that tumbleweed is looking at you.

-   In a video by novelist and social commentator Andrew Klavan regarding president Barack Obama's "Recovery Summer" initiative, he stated "The president's appointment of radicals and tax cheats, his corruption of the justice department, and, oh yeah, the renewal of the Patriot Act, have all been greeted by the summery sound of mainstream media crickets (_image of CNN office, sound of crickets chirping_). Much more relaxing!" Listen to it here.

    **Curly:** I say we paint our faces with tiger stripes, and free all the animals of the zoo!  
    _\[silence\]_  
    **Helga:** That sounds great, Curly. We'll meet you there at eight.  
    **Curly:** Hooray! Free the animals! _\[runs off laughing maniacally\]_  
    **Helga:** Poor, twisted little freak.

    -   In "I Love You, Grease Pig!", Jasmine jokingly warns Samey not to let her hand swell up into a wicket-keeper's glove.
