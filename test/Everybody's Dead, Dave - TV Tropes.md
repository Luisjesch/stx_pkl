**Lister:** Where is everybody, Hol?  
**Holly:** They're dead, Dave.  
**Lister:** Who is?  
**Holly:** Everybody, Dave.  
**Lister:** What... Captain Hollister?!  
**Holly:** _Everybody's_ dead, Dave.

This is beyond the loss of a Red Shirt, or even a Red Shirt Army. Sometimes, to show that a situation is really, really dire, the main character and his friends have to look around and see that _everybody_ except themselves is dead.

Sure, life might be going on elsewhere. Greece was still populated when Odysseus lost his crew. But for the person who survived, everyone is gone — they are alone. Maybe there really are no people left and you are officially After the End — the last group of survivors. Have fun with a lifetime of isolation!

When used to conclude a story, the idea is a tragic ending, but still allows the main characters to move on to the next adventure and try harder next time. When used as a story setup, expect the Sole Survivor to cope with Survivor's Guilt.

This trope can be an outcome of necessity to Bring News Back, with the messenger alone surviving. A common subversion is that the whole event is part of some nefarious scheme to get a hero's cooperation, and no one is actually dead. Sometimes this is the prologue to a Ghost Ship story. If the main characters _themselves_ start dying off, it's a Dwindling Party. This is a common trope for slasher films, where having more than one character from the main cast make it to the ending credits is somewhat unusual.

See also Ten Little Murder Victims, Last of His Kind, Dwindling Party, Only the Leads Get a Happy Ending, and Late to the Tragedy. Compare and contrast Total Party Kill, "Everybody Dies" Ending, and Everybody Lives. Compare Party Scattering, where the same feeling of abandonment is invoked for each main character separately, but without any of them dying.

**Since this is a Death Trope, expect spoilers.**

    Anime and Manga 

-   Also by "Kill Em All" Tomino, _Aura Battler Dunbine_ ends with the whole cast dying in a dramatic final battle, except for Cham Huau, and her fate afterwards is left ambiguous.
-   _Berserk_: At the end of the anime, almost the entire Band of the Hawk gets brutally slaughtered by demons in a manner that exemplifies numerous primal fears after their leader, Griffith, goes bad and sacrifices everyone to become a demon god. The only ones to make it out of the Eclipse alive are Guts and Casca, and neither of them make it out whole, if you know what we're talking about. Enjoy knowing the endearing, Badass Normal minor characters while you can.
-   Played as a joke/Shout-Out to _Red Dwarf_ in _CLANNAD_. When Sunohara wakes up after falling asleep in class, Okazaki plays a prank and tells him that the world has ended; He is actually a hologram and Sunohara is the only person left on Earth. Naturally, Sunohara freaks out and asks whether this is true. Okazaki then admits he's lying; he's actually a cyborg. This serves to freak Sunohara out even more.
-   During the battle in the north in _Claymore_, which was really a purge of the troublesome warriors, out of the twenty-four claymores sent there only seven survived.
-   _Code Geass_ seems to start like this: Before the first episode is even finished, it seems that everyone who could have been a supporting character in the story is dead, and only in the subsequent episodes do you find out that C.C. and Suzaku both survived getting shot.
-   _Cyberpunk: Edgerunners_ ends with every named character with the exceptions of Lucy and Falco dying. Mostly against Adam Smasher.
-   This is what happens in the Wham Episode number 6 of _The Daughter of Twenty Faces_ to the Twenty-Faces' original team, with only Chiko herself surviving the massacre and the subsequent fireworks.
-   The ending of the original _Devilman_ manga. **Everybody** except Satan bites it.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   People die all the time, but it is taken to its most extreme near the end of the Buu Saga of _Dragon Ball Z_. After previously taking out most of the humans on Earth, then soon after a large chunk of the supporting cast, Kid Buu nearly finishes the job by taking out the Earth itself. By the time the final battle begins, Goku, Hercule/Mr. Satan and Baba (Oh, and Bee the dog) are the only residents of Earth left alive. Everyone gets better, of course (Earth included!)
    -   The Saiyans. The entire population, which was only a couple thousand, is reduced to _four_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  or eight <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , if you're going by the movies and specials in a matter of _minutes_. Going against Dragon Ball's usual 'death has no consequence' vibe, the Saiyans are Killed Off for Real.
    -   Future Trunks' timeline. _All_ of the main characters are dead except Trunks and Bulma. Everyone is murdered by the androids and Goku died earlier from a heart virus, which can't be reversed by the Dragon Balls since it counts as a natural death. The timeline where Cell came from is even more of a downer since he kills Trunks, leaving only Bulma alive. None of this can be reversed with the Dragon Balls since Kami is long dead because Piccolo was killed.
        -   It's even worse in _Super_ where Future Trunks' timeline is attacked by Goku Black and Zamasu. In the end Zamasu kills EVERY REMAINING human in this timeline (except for Future Trunks, Future Mai, Present Bulma <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Vegeta, and Goku). Zamasu himself is then destroyed by Zeno, who destroyed the entire multiverse, making Trunks and Mai not just the last survivors on Earth, but also the last survivors in their timeline.
-   _Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA_: Kuro demands to know where the rest of the Einzbern family is so that she can get her life back on track. Iri bluntly says that "they're gone." It's heavily implied that Iri and Kiritsugu _slaughtered_ the entire family to keep them from using their daughter Illya as a tool in the Holy Grail War. That's why the Holy Grail Wars stopped suddenly in this timeline.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist_, Scar initially believes himself to be the only survivor of the Ishval genocide.
    -   In later chapters of the manga it is revealed that Hohenheim was originally a slave in Xerxes, and when Father tricked the king into using the entire population of the country to create a philosopher's stone only the two of them survived.
    -   And in an even later chapter Father kills everyone in Amestris besides Ed, Al, Hohenheim, Izumi, Roy, May, Pride, and Greedling. Of course, it happens at the end of a chapter in a series known for cliff-hangers, so not all of them stay dead.
-   Happens to Sousuke in _Full Metal Panic!_ in Episode 17. The events of that episode also parallel a part of his Backstory.
-   There is the first episode of _Ga-Rei -Zero-_ in which everyone who gets introduced promptly drops dead before the credits begins to roll.
-   Happens to the team at the beginning of _GoLion_ — they return from a space mission only to find that humanity on Earth has wiped itself out due to a nuclear war, shortly before being captured by the Galra Empire. This fact was, of course, edited away when it was adapted into _Voltron_, with the footage used to imply something very different.
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_:
    -   Tatarigoroshi-hen and Yakusamashi-hen end like this. In both instances, the point-of-view character (Keiichi in the former and Satoko in the latter) is the sole survivor, and for similar reasons; they both fall off the same bridge into a river that carries them out of Hinamizawa.\]\] Keiichi spends the rest of his life in an asylum because he thought he caused the accident, while Satoko ends up comatose and is killed when she wakes up.
    -   Also occurs at the start of the second series, subverting the happy ending of the first series with Rena being talked down by Keiichi. Turns out everyone was killed in a "gas leak" (yeah right) except for Rena, who happened to be out of town at the time. Rena is still alive thirty years later in the present day, but she's not the chipper kid she once was anymore.
-   _Hellsing_:
    -   The series begins with Seras Victoria's entire police unit being slaughtered by vampires. Technically, she gets killed by a vampire too, but...
    -   The only members of Hellsing alive after the Valentine brothers attack are Walter, Integra, and whoever was on vacation that day (Victoria and Alucard don't count). The next assault on Hellsing leaves only two alive (not counting Victoria).
    -   Following the end of the Millennium attack on London, only Integra, Seras, Heinkel, and some few others are left alive.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ is infamous for frequently killing off protagonists near the end of each arc. It's especially prevalent at the end of the sixth arc where all the main cast, with the exception of Emporio, are killed off by the Big Bad, . Thankfully most of them get better.
-   From the ninth Lupin III special, _Lupin III: Island of Assassins_: Everyone who wanted to leave the Tarantula is killed, including Broken Bird and potential Lupin love interest Elen. Only Lupin and his gang survive.
-   In the spiritual predecessor to the original _Mobile Suit Gundam_, _Space Runaway Ideon_ the whole cast and its namesake ship are killed off. The hero realizes that he is the last of their group shortly before dying himself.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   This is Sasuke's backstory. Every single member of his clan was killed by his Aloof Big Brother in a single night.
    -   Kakashi's Back Story is like this, too. In relatively rapid succession, his mother, father, best friend, mentor, mentor's wife, and other teammate all die. It's apparently for this reason that he joined ANBU at age fourteen. Much later, when Sasuke half-threatens to kill someone important to Kakashi to make him feel his pain, Kakashi simply replies that everyone he cares about is already dead. Finding out that one of his loved ones isn't as dead as he thought (at least not physically) does not bring him any comfort.
-   After lots of building up to the moment, in Chapter 352 of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, it is apparent that, while Asuna has been asleep protecting the Magic World, everyone she knew has died — even Negi, who supposedly has an immortal body, and Ayaka, who lived to the age of 115 to try to meet Asuna at the time she was supposed to wake up. However, it's sort of subverted a little bit, since Evangeline and _Chao_, of all people, appear to still be alive.
    -   Chao _DID_ say she was from a hundred years in the future, and is a time traveller..
-   Extreme example — _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ where only two young teenagers are left in the world, with each person turned into Tang.
    -   Though, to be fair, the people turned into Tang aren't so much dead as they are all assimilated into one big consciousness, and they all having the chance to snap out of it if their will to live as an individual is strong enough.
-   Being a Darker and Edgier\-subversion-cum-Genre Deconstruction of the Magical Girl genre, _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ plays with this trope. This happens in pretty much all the other timelines - to the extent where _the entire world_ has been killed off save Homura (and that damned Weasel Mascot, of course). The ending is a subversion: right before everybody ends up dead, Madoka hits the Reset Button, bringing Mami, Kyouko, and probably a lot of civilians Back from the Dead, but at the cost of being erased from existence.
-   In the most recent arc of _Reborn! (2004)_ Tsuna and Co. are transported 10 years into the future where they are told many major supporting characters have been killed by a rival mafia group. Including all the arcobalenos (including Reborn), Yamamoto's father and _Tsuna himself_ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Tsuna's parents, Vongola 9th boss, Shamal and Naito Longchamp are still MIA.
    -   Also, by the same author, _élDLIVE_. In Chapter 31, the enemy group, Heaven Sider, planted a lethal virus inside elDLIVE's Solar System District Station. Chuuta and the main team were outside, teaching him to move in space. When they decide that it's enough, they head back to the station, but when they try to access, they can't open the door, because there's already an emergency code. They check in their computers the personnel's status. A large screen displaying the personnel's faces was also marking them with a big X over them and a DEAD word below them. They decide to check the bridge, only to find those they were friends with, in their last seconds.
-   In _Saikano_, the main character is the only one left on the desolated Earth at the end.
    -   An early fan sub of the series put a disclaimer on the third to last episode: "A friendly warning from the team: This is the end of happiness in Saikano. If you would prefer the anime to have a happy end, consider stopping here and pretending there are no more episodes. Continuing will only bring misery and pain. You have been warned..." Never has a better synopsis of a final episode been written.
    -   To really drive home the futility of the situation, in the manga not only is he the only human left alive, he is the only living being trapped on a spaceship that is the final(?) form of his girlfriend. She had one last shred of humanity left and saved only him. And then she admits she forgot he needs food. He's going to slowly starve to death/die of thirst while drifting through space.
-   This is the situation near the end of _Sailor Moon_, but (fast) everybody gets better at the end
-   _Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas_. Nearing the end, with Aries Shion and Libra Dohko supporting each other thinking they are the only survivor after Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies. They aren't, but they may as well be.
-   _Shelter_: The truth of Rin's life is that she's been all by her lonesome for several years following the destruction of Earth, and she doesn't realize she's possibly the last human left alive. Rather than being a forlorn ending, however, the trope is partially subverted as this revelation- being saved by her father and having her memories of him- means she will never be truly alone so long as she carries those memories.
-   Filicia in _Sound of the Sky_ is the only survivor of her old unit. She's alright... most of the time.
-   _Vexille_ does this soon after The Squad infiltrates hostile territory, with only the titular Action Girl apparently surviving the slaughter. It is later revealed that her lover The Captain also survives but he doesn't reappear until the end of the movie.
-   _X: The Movie_ The movie literally ends in all the involved characters, except for the protagonist, Kamui, dying in some graphic, brutal way.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh!: Bonds Beyond Time_, Yugi experiences this as he is the only survivor after Paradox destroys Domino City.

    Comic Books 

-   All of three or five characters survive in the end of _100 Bullets_. Three if you count the ones who get away, five if you count Graves and Dizzy, both of whom are bleeding out, holding a gun to each other, and stuck in a burning building.
-   Thorn, Gran'ma, and the Bones react as if they are in an Everybody's Dead situation after the Locust's volcano erupts about two thirds of the way through _Bone_, because they can't detect any other survivors. Lucius, the villagers, and the Veni-yan monks did survive, as well as most of the city of Athiea, and most everyone else who died came back when the ghost circles were destroyed at the end.
-   Near the end of _Maus_, Art asks his father Vladek what happened to Art's paternal family after the war. Vladek then explains briefly what happened to each of them as far as he knows. All except one brother who now lives in Israel died in the Holocaust.
-   In The DCU mini-series _Kingdom Come_, viewpoint character Norman McKay has prophetic visions telling him that this will happen to Superman. In the end it happens exactly like that. Except instead of redshirts, it's a battlefield filled with most of the superhuman characters in the DC universe which gets hit with a nuke. There _are_ survivors, thanks to Captain Marvel's Heroic Sacrifice, but most of them are dead, with Superman kneeling in the ashes, more or less unharmed but _exceptionally angry_.
-   The premise of the original batch of _Marvel Zombies_ stories. The intermittently intelligent zombies don't know what to do since they _ate everyone_. Then, in the sequel, they have the same problem AGAIN, after eating nearly everyone in the entire KNOWN UNIVERSE. Hank Pym: "I can't believe we ate the whole thing.".
    -   In the related _Army of Darkness Versus Marvel Zombies_, Ash fights through the zombie invasion from first bite to apocalyptic showdown. He's allowed access to Doctor Doom's dimension spanning machine and waits too long to make a choice of what dimensions. He ends up right back in a similar world of everyone's dead, except the super-powered zombies are now werewolves.
-   In _Miracleman_ the eponymous character discovers that his nemesis has killed virtually every single person in London. During the fight to stop the carnage from spreading they kill everyone else in the city. The issue ends with Miracleman crying over the body of his enemy's innocent alternate personality and sitting on a pile of corpses.
-   In _The Punisher MAX_ miniseries _Born_, Frank Castle's last Vietnam deployment ends with him as the sole survivor of Firebase Valley Forge, surrounded by the corpses of all his comrades and the hundreds of Vietcong who overran the base. The Vietcong directly around him have all been beaten to death with the butt of his gun. None of the soldiers who show up to "rescue" him are particularly surprised at what he eventually becomes.
-   The first _The Transformers (Marvel)_ comic book starts its Un-Cancelled run with the bad guys victorious and the good guys reduced to one pacifistic medic and a bunch of scrap.
-   The end of the Wildstorm series _Stormwatch_ has almost the entire team of superheroes killed by xenomorphs
-   In Robert Kirkman's _The Walking Dead_, the main character wakes in a hospital after being shot in a firefight — he's a cop — only to find the hospital apparently empty. Then he finds the zombies. The city is in much the same state. He does find survivors though, including his wife and son. Although it's not good news for the survivors either. It's a Zombie Apocalypse, so that's expected.
-   In _White Sand_, when Kenton realizes that he's the last Sand Master alive, the point is driven home by a double page spread showing him standing amidst dozens of corpses.
-   _The Ultimates_: The Ultimates go with all their military forces at their disposal to fight an alien invasion in Micronesia. It's actually a trap by the aliens, who detonate an atomic bomb. The Ultimates themselves manage to survive thanks to Iron Man's forcefield, but everybody else is killed.
-   _Guardians of the Galaxy_: The very first story begins with astronaut Charlie-27 returning from a deep space flight to find the Badoon have conquered and enslaved most of mankind, his family included, and the slaves will be sent to a mining camp with lethal conditions that will kill them in a few months. He meets up with three other survivors, and they try escaping to New New York, hoping the Badoon haven't got there yet. They have, and the four arrive to the sight of the colony burning to the ground. Later stories confirm that Charlie was unable to save his family.

    Comic Strips 

-   Used in _Garfield_, in a Halloween storyline starting on October 23, 1989 where Garfield wakes up to find that Jon and Odie are gone. And his home has been abandoned for some time. Which can only mean...
-   Spoofed in a _Peanuts_ strip where Peppermint Patty, after napping in class, wakes up to find the room empty except for Marcie, who tells her the world came to an end and they are the only survivors. Patty looks out the window and asks "So why is the playground full of kids?" Marcy replies "Sorry, sir. When I saw you got an A on that quiz, I thought the world had come to an end." (Schulz said he intended the strip to make fun of preachers predicting the end of the world, and was surprised when no one wrote him to complain about it.)

    Fan Works 

-   In _Fighting for the Future_, Weiss' nightmare in "Shadows, Part 7" implies that Salem killed everyone in the previous timeline and that she was the only one who survived.
-   _Last One Standing_ contains a particularly heartbreaking moment when Twilight Sparkle suddenly realizes that she really is going to die, just like all her friends before her.
-   _The Night Unfurls_: With the exception of the Doll, it is implied in Kyril's backstory that every named character he met in Yharnam (or rather, the ones who are on good terms with him) is dead.
-   In _Stars Above_, this is what happens in the future of the Madoka-verse, after the appearance of Vittoria.
-   The _Lyrical Nanoha_ fanfic "Toward the World's End" invokes this. In fact, if you'll believe the author, it's based around it. In the first fic, "Lifetime Destiny" what may be the _entire_ population of earth is wiped out. The only known survivors, under a eerie green sky, are the series protagonist Nanoha herself, and the fic's OC Protagonist, Arthur Kingston. Arthur manages to take Nanoha and himself to a deserted island, to spare Nanoha from having to see death and dead bodies everywhere as well, completely cutting them off.
    -   This happens again when Nanoha, Arthur and the others return in fic number 3: Mission Fail.
        -   According to the Author, the whole idea for the fic came from a dream that was this trope.
-   In _Mega Man: Defender of the Human Race_, this is the result of Operation: Badlands Strike in episode 11. Everyone but Mega Man is badly injured or killed.
-   In _Casting Rain_, there's a moment (a whole chapter, really), where Grillby realizes all of his friends are dead, leaving him alone to fight an increasingly hopeless war

    Film — Animation 

-   In _The Incredibles_, Mr. Incredible hacks into Syndrome's computer to discover that variations of the giant robot have killed off many former superheroes — perhaps _all_ former superheroes except for Frozone, Elastigirl, and Mr. Incredible himself. Genocide makes for a fairly bleak subject in a family-friendly movie.
-   In Disney's _Mulan_, the protagonists are journeying through a mountain pass to unite with the rest of the Chinese army, only to find that the army and the villagers they were protecting have all been slaughtered, including Li Shang's father. Later, the same thing happens to the antagonists after a devastating avalanche kills all but six of the Huns.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   The hero of _28 Days Later_ wakes up in a hospital bed to find that he's apparently the only person remaining in the whole of London. He isn't, but almost everyone else has been transformed by The Virus into enraged superhuman bloodthirsty almost\-zombies (so not quite dead, but near-enough).
-   In _2001: A Space Odyssey_, Dave Bowman finds out all of his crewmen are dead because HAL killed Frank Poole by cutting his lifeline during an EVA and then pulled the plug on the hibernation systems, killing everyone else. In the end, Dave gets zapped by the Monolith and turned into the Star Child. As far as Earth is concerned, until they find out otherwise in _2010: The Year We Make Contact_, literally everybody really is dead. The _Red Dwarf_ premise, which is actually the Trope Namer as opposed to _2001_, may be a Shout-Out to _2001_.
-   In _A.I.: Artificial Intelligence_, the boy robot is frozen in stasis while the world wastes away and humanity becomes extinct. Eventually, highly advanced robots come and put the boy in an alternate reality, also giving him back his mother for a day before permanently shutting him down and storing his mind as a historical archive.
-   The _Alien_ movies
    -   In _Alien_, Ripley and her cat are the only survivors; the alien kills the other six people on board.
    -   In, _Aliens_, Ripley, Newt, Cpl. Hicks, and Bishop survive. The aliens completely demolish the squad of marines. At the beginning of _Alien 3_, we learn that Newt and Hicks are killed while in hypersleep, leaving only Ripley and Bishop.
    -   In _Alien³_, Morse is the only survivor. Ripley, impregnated by a facehugger in hypersleep, kills herself.
    -   _Alien: Resurrection_ broke the trend; Ripley, Call, Johner and Vriess survive.
    -   _Prometheus_ Only Dr. Shaw and David the android (who was never truly alive anyway) survive out of a crew of seventeen.
-   _Army of Darkness_ originally ended with Ash _starting_ taking his magic potion, which he must take one drop of for each of the four centuries that he wishes to sleep, pauses to glance at a noise, and accidentally overdoses by one drop. When he wakes up, he's the last man on Earth looking over an apocalyptic wasteland screaming "No! I slept too long!". The Hollywood studio demanded a more kickass ending.
-   By the end of _Avengers: Infinity War_, half of the universe's population is extinguished by Thanos' Badass Fingersnap. This includes the new Avengers (except War Machine) and the Guardians (except Nebula and Rocket). Earlier in the movie, Thanos and the Black Order massacre half of the Asgardian refugees, including Heimdall and Loki, leaving Thor as one of the few survivors of his kind. However, in _Avengers: Endgame_, all the characters killed by The Snap are brought back, leaving only those who were killed by other means still dead, which was Heimdall, Loki, Vision, and Gamora (though she got replaced by a younger version of herself who hadn't met the Guardians of the Galaxy yet).
-   Only two students out of the forty-two who make up the cast of _Battle Royale_ survive the Program. And that's precisely one student more than was meant to survive and "win the game".
    -   In the original book, the "winner" was not one of the two survivors.
-   _The Brest Fortress_ is a Russian film depicting the siege of the titular fortress. In the end, almost every character is dead, even Anya is told to be Executed by Germans, along with all other women and children, with the sole exception of the main character, who somehow escapes.
-   At the end of _Children of Men_, Kee and her baby are the only ones who are left alive.
-   In _Cold Prey_, only Jannicke survives. The ending song is the alternative Trope Namer (All My Friends Are Dead).
-   Steiner, in _Cross of Iron_, after Stransky has Steiner's men machine-gunned on returning from behind enemy lines.
    
    **Stransky:** Where is the rest of your platoon? Sergeant Steiner!  
    **Steiner:** You, Captain Stransky. You are the rest of my platoon.  
    \* Another Russian film, _The Dawns Here Are Quiet_ (1972), takes place during World War II and follows an army sergeant in command of an Amazon Brigade made up of utterly incompetent volunteers. They try to stop a German diversion group and succeed at the cost of all of girls' lives (while the sergeant survives until twenty years after the war).
    
-   In _The Day of the Triffids_, Masen wakes up on a hospital bed, and realizes that a freak space phenomenon has caused everyone to go blind. The only people unaffected are those like him who were asleep, sedated, or otherwise unable to look at the sky. The resulting collapse of civilization causes most of mankind to die like flies, and that's when the killer mutant plants show up. In the movie, this scene comes across almost like _28 Days Later_ (or vice versa, since this movie came first)... except after that he finds _one_ other person, and then they do find some other survivors. Unfortunately, they happen to be on board a plane, and, due to panic and a blind pilot, they go down in a fiery crash, children included. It's extremely disturbing compared to the rest of the fairly goofy film.
-   At the end of _The Eye_, there is a huge gas tanker explosion, killing almost everyone in sight apart from Mun and Wah.
-   In the end of _The Fall_ Roy kills off all of his characters with the exception of the masked bandit, whom he spares at the last minute.
-   _Feeding Frenzy_ plays this for comedy with a bit of lampshading that there weren't very many characters of importance to begin with. After escaping from the villain's clutches at the end of the second act, Christine cries, "Everyone's dead! Kyle... some girl I made out with at a frat party... that guy."
-   _From Dusk Till Dawn_ ends with only the main character and one girl surviving. The sequels tend to follow this formula, too.
-   _Gettysburg_ has a memorable exchange between General Lee and Pickett after the famous charge by Pickett's division resulted in said division being massacred. (Note that it's also believed to have happened in Real Life.)
    
    **Lee:** General Pickett, sir. You must look to your division.  
    **Pickett:** General Lee... I _have no_ division.
    
    -   A sergeant reported to Colonel Chamberlain at Little Round Top that their C.O. Vincent was wounded and they had reinforced by a brigade, but their commander was dead and they had moved an artillery battery to the top of the hill and _their_ commander was dead as well.
    -   There is a similar scene in _When Trumpets Fade_, a movie about the Battle of Hurtgen Forest in late 1944. A commanding officer asks his lieutenant, "What is the status of your platoon?" In reply, the shell-shocked lieutenant mutely hands his superior a pile of bloodied dog tags.
    -   A the end of _Hamburger Hill_ after we've witnessed a number of the main cast killed, the movie fades to the credits with the platoon's radio squawking and their off-screen CO asking for the platoon leader, platoon sergeant, 1st squad leader, since nobody is left to answer the call.
-   In _Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn_, after Master Chief saves a quartet of cadets at a Covenant-besieged military academy, they ask him why he came for them. He responds that they are the only survivors. When one of them asks "Of the school?", the Chief corrects him with "On the planet." This is reinforced in a following scene, as Chief and the cadets walk past the fresh corpses of countless UNSC soldiers and cadets.
-   In _The Hateful Eight_, everyone, past and present, dies... though Warren and Mannix's deaths are merely heavily implied.
-   _The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1_:
    -   District 12 had 915 survivors out of ten thousand. The burned bodies of the dead are found along the main road.
    -   And again with the hospital in District 8. Katniss even says that there are no survivors.
-   In _Inglourious Basterds_, only three members of the original ensemble survive.
-   Both versions of _The Ladykillers_ end with a sort of inversion of the title; the entire gang ends up dead while the old lady survives.
-   _The Last Starfighter_ features this exchange between protagonist Alex and his alien navigator Grig:
    
    **Grig:** Death is a primitive concept. I prefer to think of them as battling evil. In another dimension.  
    **Alex:** Another dimension? How many are left?  
    **Grig:** Including yourself?  
    **Alex:** Yeah!  
    **Grig:** One.
    
-   Ethan Hunt is the only survivor of the six man team from the Prague mission in 1996's _Mission: Impossible_ ("My team! My team is DEAD!"). or so he thinks at first.
-   The fate of the entire "Odyssey" crew except for Julia. Bonus whammy points for this information being given to her by a clone of _her own husband_ in _Oblivion (2013)_.
-   _The New Mutants_: Granted it has a Minimalist Cast, but it's notable that literally every character that appears on-screen other than the titular mutants are dead by the end of the film, at the hands of the mutants no less.
-   Kainan's backstory in _Outlander_ involves two separate instances of this trope. Kainan is a human warrior from a highly advanced civilisation far from Earth whose military colonized a planet after wiping out the indigenous population of Moorwen. One Moorwen survived and wiped out the entire colony, after which Kainan captured the dragon-like creature, only to crash land on Earth circa 709AD, setting it free amongst the Vikings.
-   _The Quiet Earth_: the quote says it all.
    
    Zac Hobson, July 5th. One: there has been a malfunction in Project Flashlight with devastating results. Two: it seems I am the only person left on Earth.
    
-   _The Raid Redemption_ is about a twenty man police outfit raiding an apartment complex that is the base of operations for a ruthless crime lord, but they are there under false pretenses and end up trapped. The only survivors are Rama, Bowo, and Lieutenant Wahyu, the latter of which is a Dirty Cop who is almost certain to be murdered in prison before he can even get to trial now that he has been exposed.
-   The Mexican Standoff in _Reservoir Dogs_ ends up with everyone in the room dead or near dead except for heavily wounded Mr White, mortally wounded Mr Orange, and Mr. Pink who promptly makes off with the diamonds (and gets arrested). Immediately after, Mr. White shoots Mr. Orange through the head and is shot dead by the police. NOW everybody's dead, Mr. Pink.
-   In _Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves_, Robin arrives from the crusades only to find his entire home destroyed and his family dead, his blinded servant the only survivor.
    
    -   Mercilessly parodied in _Robin Hood: Men in Tights_:
    
    **Robin Hood:** Blinkin, listen to me. They've taken the castle!  
    **Blinkin:** I thought it felt a bit drafty. Cor, this never would have happened if your father was alive.  
    **Robin Hood:** He's dead?  
    **Blinkin:** Yes.  
    **Robin Hood:** And my mother?  
    **Blinkin:** She died of pneumonia while... oh, you were away...  
    **Robin Hood:** My brothers?  
    **Blinkin:** They were all killed by the plague.  
    **Robin Hood:** My dog, Pogo?  
    **Blinkin:** Run over by a carriage.  
    **Robin Hood:** My goldfish, Goldie?  
    **Blinkin:** Eaten by the cat.  
    **Robin Hood:** (on the verge of tears) My cat?  
    **Blinkin:** Choked on the goldfish. Oh, it's good to be home, ain't it, Master Robin?
    
-   In _Serenity_, when the crew figures out that "Miranda" is a planet, the crew makes a perilous journey through Reaver territory, to try to find out why Miranda is so important. When they finally land planet-side, they discover the long dead corpses of a planet's population. There were once survivors, but they all turned into Reavers.
    -   Earlier, in the same film, after The Operative has been outwitted by the crew of _Serenity_ one more time, he proceeds to have everyone who has ever provided shelter to the crew killed, en masse, including any inconvenient bystanders and Shepard Book. This is what pushes Mal into going to Miranda to find out just what the Alliance is trying to hide.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   The Battle of Yavin in _A New Hope_ ended with all the on-screen rebel pilots except Han, Luke, Wedge, and a Y-wing pilot dead, with all of the dead pilots having only been introduced so they could fight in the battle. However, the Expanded Universe continues to write more and more just-off-screen characters into the battle.
    -   In _Revenge of the Sith_, all of the (appearing onscreen) Jedi are killed except for Yoda and Obi-Wan.
    -   By the end of _Rogue One_, every single member of the titular team, including the main characters, are dead, leaving only characters Saved by Canon left standing.
-   _Sunshine_ — the movie's old website gushed about having each of the principle characters die.
-   _The Thing (1982)_ is set at an American research outpost with a dozen men living there. By the end of the movie, everyone's dead except MacReady and Childs, and unless a rescue team gets there _soon,_ arctic exposure will do the survivor(s) in. The prequel film follows suit, as Kate and Lars are the only survivors, with their fates looking equally bleak.
-   _Three Days of the Condor_ plays this trope straight at the very beginning: the protagonist goes out of the office to get lunch and upon returning minutes later finds all of his co-workers, friends and love interest brutally murdered.

    Literature 

-   _Aniara_: The poem ends with the narrator, the last living human on the doomed ship, sitting in the mima hall, calmly awaiting his own death while occasionally broadcasting a message about _Aniara_'s fate into the void, hoping that there is someone who can still hear it.
    
    Around the mima’s grave we sprawled in rings,
    
    fallen and to guiltless ashes changed,
    
    delivered from the stars’ embittered stings.
    
    And through us all Nirvana’s current ranged.
    
-   In _Awake in the Night Land_ all organic lifeforms of the Universe, except the humans, were killed by the time the book starts.
-   Markus Zusak's _The Book Thief_ ends with the entire street where Liesel lives with her foster family being bombed to rubble by the American planes. _Everybody dies,_ except for Liesel, who happened to be lurking in the basement, reading a book; Alex Steiner, who was working for the German Army as a tailor; and Max, who was in a concentration camp at the time. The only things keeping this from being a Diabolus ex Machina are that 1. The narrator is Death himself ("I do not wear a cloak with a hood unless it is chilly"), and 2. Since the prologue, the narrator has been informing the audience of how everyone is going to die. ("A fact about Rudy Steiner: he did not deserve to die the way that he did.") and 3. The bombings were plenty foreshadowed themselves. Saves this book from being thrown at the wall of many a reader's corner.
-   _The Brief History of the Dead_ starts with this for the entire world, as one last survivor is stranded somewhere in Antarctica. The world of the dead is a bit more crowded — they don't fade until everyone who remembers them is dead, so she's preserving her friends, her family, and the checkout worker at the grocery store she used to shop at. Then she dies, and away they go.
-   In _Catch-22_, by the end of the book, nearly all of the characters are dead. But because they only died one at a time and each chapter only focused on a few characters, this realization doesn't really hit the reader until the last chapter, where there's hardly any left.
    -   In _Catch-22_'s sequel _Closing Time_, Yossarian and the chaplain are the sole survivors of a nuclear war that killed everybody on Earth. They then decide to commit passive suicide by leaving the bunker.
-   At the end of _The Chronicles of Narnia_, Susan is the only character left alive. This isn't really a happy ending for her though if you think about it, since it ends focusing on the fact that her family and all friends of the family are now in heaven and she is, frankly, not.
    -   Not only that, but we're informed that she might never get there. Contrary to popular belief, she is not banned out of Heaven for liking lipstick or attending parties, but rather because she refused to believe they really did go to Narnia, believing (or more likely pretending to) that it was just a silly game they would play. Essentially she forgot what was important to her or what's real and replaced it with meaningless fancies. C.S. Lewis left it up to our own interpretation of Susan's personality whether she would find her way again.
    -   In the prequel novel _The Magician's Nephew_ Jadis used The Deplorable Word to destroy _all living things in the world_ except herself.
-   At the start of _The Cold Moons_, Bamber goes out to forage but finds his brother Oatear dying. Oatear tells him that the entire communal sett has died. When Bamber rushes to his sett, he finds his mate and newborn cubs dead. This leaves Bamber the only living badger around. As it turns out, humans are killing badgers because they think that they're disease-carrying vermin who are spreading tuberculosis.
-   _The Commander's Daughter_ by Y. Jakovlev is set during the siege of Brest Fortress. At the end, every named character is dead, except the heroine's mother (imprisoned by enemy) and the heroine herself, who makes an Unexplained Recovery, somehow surviving the whole mess (her prototypes also survived, but in-story this less explainable than in Real Life).
-   _The Day of the Triffids_ is a classic post-apocalyptic novel by John Wyndham in which the narrator wakes up on a hospital bed, and realizes that a freak space phenomenon (later implied to have been a malfunctioning orbital weapon) has caused everyone to go blind. The only people unaffected are those like him who were asleep, sedated, or otherwise unable to look at the sky. The resulting collapse of civilization causes most of mankind to die like flies, and that's when the killer mutant plants show up.
    -   To be fair, the mutant killer plants were always there, just kept locked up and their dangerous stingers regularly docked.
    -   John Wyndham books in general start with the end of the world (except Dave), and work their way up to a climax.
-   _Doomsday Book_ has two of its time travelers arrive after the Black Death has reached Oxfordshire. In some villages there was no-one left to bury the dead.
-   _Dragonlance_ has this. When Caramon goes forward in time, he find the entire world dead.
-   _Halo: Ghosts of Onyx_ starts off this way, as the prologue details Beta Company's three-hundred man assault against a Covenant refinery. The refinery is destroyed and the mission is a success... but there are two survivors of entire battle, human or alien: Tom and Lucy. They are both twelve at the time.
-   At the start of _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_, Earth is destroyed and Arthur Dent is thrown out into the universe. Quite literally.
-   _Catching Fire:_ "Katniss...There is no District 12."
-   A rare midplot invocation in _Idlewild_ as the characters suddenly realize how many of their friends/family are virtual and how empty the world actually is.
-   Terry Pratchett's _Johnny and the Bomb_ explores the Real Life example of the _pal's battalions_ in World War I, which were special units of the British Army consisting of men from a single town. In theory, this increased camaraderie, as people were fighting alongside friends and work colleagues. In practice, they were a fearsomely efficient way to wipe out the entire young male population of a town in a single stroke.
-   The post-apocalyptic adolescent novel _The Lake at the End of the World_ subverts the trope at the beginning when a teenage boy shows up at a farm and claims to be from an underground settlement of a few hundred people. The family that takes him in assumes he's gone insane with loneliness, but naturally it turns out he's telling the truth.
-   Olaf Stapledon's _Last and First Men_ has almost the entire human race being wiped out in a nuclear holocaust with just 35 survivors. Their descendants eventually evolve into a new species of humans, which is promptly wiped out a bit later. This trend carries on, including the extinction of all life on Earth and then Venus (twice) until the 18th species of "men" is completely destroyed, along with the entire solar system, by a supernova a couple of billion years later.
-   Eiji Yoshikawa's _Musashi_ opens with one of these, the two main characters literally the only ones left after a battle. They even wake up to find themselves as such, too.
-   Happens three times in Terry Pratchett's _Nation_. A tidal wave kills everyone in Mau's village, leaving him sole survivor. A ship destroyed by the same wave leaves Daphne the one survivor (two, if you like parrots). Meanwhile, a plague has decimated England and wiped out (among others) the 137 people standing between Daphne's father and the crown.
-   This is part of Willis Corto/ Armitage's backstory in _Neuromancer_. He was part of Operation Screaming Fist, a special-forces raid on a Russian base during The War. After being shot down, he and a few others managed to steal a helicopter and escape to Finland, only to be shot to pieces by the Finnish defense forces while they were trying to land. Corto was the only one to survive the escape. Automatic Jack, a central character in the short story _Burning Chrome_, was the only other survivor of the operation as a whole.
-   In _The Odyssey_, Odysseus's ship sank, and only he survived to spend seven years with Calypso.
-   Nevil Shute's _On the Beach_ describes the reactions of the remaining survivors of an all-out nuclear war that has already destroyed most of the population of Earth. The characters are mostly Australians who are waiting for the fallout to reach them, but they know that they're already doomed.
-   Margaret Atwood's _Oryx and Crake_ is mostly flashbacks from the point of view of apparently the only human survivor of a global pandemic. The last chapters — and the sequels — reveal that there are rather more survivors than he thinks.
-   In Dean Koontz's _Phantoms_, two of the protagonists arrive to find their entire town wiped out by they don't at first know what.
-   _The Pilo Family Circus_ ends with almost everyone in the circus being slaughtered by Kurt Pilo during his Villainous Breakdown; the only confirmed survivors are Steve, Shalice the Fortune Teller, Mugabo the Magician, Gonko the Clown, and Jamie.
-   The book _The Road_ by Cormac McCarthy is about a father and son as they travel south during what is suspected to be a nuclear winter. The father and son are all they have left.
    -   Except not quite. The book is full of references to death-cults, sightings of and interactions with cannibals and their victims, an old man they share a meal and a fire with on the road, and a family of four who'd apparently been shadowing them, preparing to take the Boy in when the Father died from his illness.
-   This is the way _The Secret Garden_ _opens_, oddly enough. Mary Lennox wakes up to find that her house is completely empty and silent. She is found a few minutes later by two soldiers, who proceed to tell her that her parents and everyone else in the household have died of cholera.
-   The ending of _Sometime Never: A Fable for Supermen_ is similar to _Closing Time_ mentioned above, as the world gets nuke-washed and all the humans are dead, the Gremlins move to the surface but found out when there's no human alive, there is no imagination to keep them existing. They fade out.
-   Stephen King's _The Stand_ is about the survivors of a plague.
    -   King's _Under the Dome_. Only a handful survivors out of more than a thousand people trapped.
    -   In his short novel _The Long Walk_, only one out of the original one hundred contestants in the titular endurance competition survives. The others were all killed when they couldn't keep up the pace. Further, it is suggested in the text that the last survivor will be executed by the dystopian government.
-   The _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ novel _Fallen Heroes_. Odo and Quark accidentally shoot themselves three days into the future with an alien artifact to find the station in ruins and everyone dead. There are then a series of flashbacks showing just what happened — aliens attacked the station looking for the artifact, which wasn't there as it had been sent into the future... they end up putting everything right by figuring out how to time travel back into the past again.
-   _Tailchaser's Song_:
    -   As a kitten, Tailchaser returned home to find his mother and siblings gone without a trace.
    -   Roofshadow is from Forest-Light Clan. When she returns home for the day, she comes back to the sight of almost everyone from her clan torn to pieces. The ones that aren't shredded (including her father) are just gone.
-   _These Broken Stars_: All fifty thousand people aboard the _Icarus_, minus our two heroes, are killed when it's yanked out of hyperspace and crashes into the planet. Tarver and Lilac watch in horror as it plunges to the planet's surface, trailing nonfunctioning escape pods on fire.
-   In _Unique_, Ophelia finds out halfway through that almost every vampire in the world that didn't take the government deal (which is _every_ vampire she knows except her own coven) has been wiped out by either Monster Hunters or government kill squads.
-   In "The Yarn of the 'Nancy Bell'" (the first of the _Bab Ballads_ by W. S. Gilbert), the sole survivor of the Nancy Bell's crew describes what happened to the others.
-   _Z for Zachariah_ — the only survivor initially is the young girl in the mysteriously unaffected valley, writing her diary.
-   _Earth Abides_ is about the last survivors of a global catastrophe.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _24_:
    -   Jack's backstory involves a mission by a Special Forces team to take out Victor Drazen, a genocidal Milosevic lieutenant. An emotionally scarred Jack is presumed to be the only one who makes it out alive...until team member Stephen Saunders surfaces as the Big Bad in Season 3.
    -   They failed to kill Victor Drazen and his sons as well.
    -   In the 1-2 P.M. episode, Pillar hears this from a wounded Russian bodyguard who answers a manipulative Russian diplomat's cell phone right after Jack slaughtered the entire detail.
-   In _Andromeda_, the titular ship ends up fully crewed in Season 4. However, during the Magog attack at the end of the season, everyone aboard the ship is slaughtered other than Dylan and Trance (the other main characters being conveniently off-ship). Dylan even uses this as a tactical advantage, as with no crew left there's nothing to stop him removing all the oxygen (except in the section he and Trance are in) to kill all the Magog still aboard.
-   _Babylon 5_
    -   In the episode "GROPOS". Note, however, that this may be more a case of Redshirt Army.
    -   In the episode "Confessions and Lamentations", members of one of the minor species on the station (the Markab start coming down with an unknown illness, which eventually begins to kill them off. Rather than looking at it scientifically, they get whipped into a religious fervor and decide that it's the judgment of God killing the immoral, and all they need to do to be saved is to come together to pray and perform sacred rituals. As they lock themselves away, Delenn and Lennier (two regular cast members, immune to the plague because of the species difference) go in with them to offer help. At the end of the episode, the doctor on the station figures out a cure and races down with it to save everyone... and they're all dead. The two regular cast members are the only ones left alive, with Delenn is holding the corpse of the obligatory cute child who had been dancing around earlier in the episode. In fact, news reports at the end of the episode state that the plague was severe enough that it effectively killed off the entire species, and they never appear on the show again.
    -   "War Without End" features the station picking up a Distress Signal from the Bad Future, unintentionally sent back in time by the Negative Space Wedgie in Sector 14, in which Ivanova reports that The Captain is dead, and that the station is about to be destroyed by the enemy. This is during the Cold Open; the _real_ spoilers don't show up until **DRAAL** gets in contact with Captain Sheridan.
-   Both the new and old _Battlestar Galactica_ series begins with a devastating Cylon attack on the Colonies, leaving only the Galactica and a number of civilian ships. There Is Another.
-   In _Designated Survivor_, Kirman literally watches as **the entire US government**, including the president, vice president, the cabinet, Supreme Court and Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the majority of Congress, is killed in a violent, fiery explosion, leaving him as the Sole Survivor.
-   _Doctor Who_ does this several times:
    -   "Pyramids of Mars": Everyone dies but the Doctor and Sarah Jane.
    -   "Horror of Fang Rock": Everybody on the island except the Doctor and Leela, dead.
    -   "Warriors of the Deep": Every named character but one is killed (and that one is a fairly minor one). Famous because the Doctor figures out how to destroy the invaders quite early in the story, but can't bring himself to kill them until it's too late for all the people he might have saved (including the invaders).
    -   Let us not forget "Resurrection of the Daleks". The only survivors besides the Doctor, Tegan, and Turlough are Davros and the Mercenary Commander (who gets killed off in a later episode).
    -   "The Caves of Androzani": Everybody on the (sparsely populated) planet of Androzani Minor except the Doctor's companion, dead (at least every named character — we are not told explicitly that all of the soldiers were involved in the failed attack in the caves died, but we are not told that anybody survived, either). And yes, that includes the Doctor. He gets better. Bonus points for also killing off all but one of the characters who appear in scenes on Androzani Major, although the off-screen population survives intact.
    -   Happened offscreen during the Time War, when the Time Lords and Daleks were wiped out and only the Doctor seems to have survived. The Ninth Doctor's epic Survivor Guilt over this was arguably his main character trait.
    -   Both lampshaded and joyously averted in "The Doctor Dances", in the process naming a contrasting trope:
    -   "The Parting of the Ways": Everybody not evacuated from the Game Station except companion Rose Tyler, dead. (Including the Doctor again. And his other companion, Jack Harkness, although he gets brought back by Applied Phlebotinum (permanently, it turns out). Plus a considerable percentage of Earth's population.)
    -   "Gridlock": A major reveal is that due to a plague 24 years before, everyone in the upper city of New New York is dead, leaving the people sealed below in the undercity and the motorway the only people alive on New Earth besides the Face of Boe and Novice Hame.
    -   "Turn Left" is one long conversation between Donna and Rose Tyler. Donna turns right instead of left, and the whole world changes. Every other character that's ever had billing in all three series and is not already dead, dies in this episode through one Heroic Sacrifice after another. That is, the Doctor (who does _not_ get better), Martha, Sarah Jane, Maria, Clyde, Luke, Gwen and Ianto. Jack is still alive, but a prisoner of the Sontarans and is in no position to help.
    -   In "The Waters of Mars", it is flat-out stated by the Doctor himself near the beginning of the episode that every single character except himself dies. When he tries to save them, the leader, Adelaide, commits suicide anyway, knowing that she was meant to die, although two of her subordinates do remain alive.
    -   "The Time of Angels"/"Flesh and Stone": Everybody but the Doctor, Amy, and River Song are dead by the end of it. Several of the clerics are even erased from time, remembered only by the TARDIS veterans.
    -   "The Pandorica Opens" takes this to the absolute extreme. Auton Rory kills Amy, River Song gets trapped in the TARDIS as it explodes, and every single person on every single planet is wiped out of existence as the entire universe collapses.
    -   Doctor Who spin-off _Torchwood_ essentially ends this way at the end of its third series with Gwen and Jack being the last surviving members of the team after the death of Ianto and going their separate ways (although they would eventually come back together in the next series).
-   The end of the _Farscape_ episode "...Different Destinations". What's worse, it's the heroes' fault due to changing history, and just to twist the knife, the "everybody" in question was a monastery-full of nuns. _Nurse-nuns_. With _children_.
-   _Firefly_:
    -   The Battle of Serenity Valley, the climax to the Great Offscreen War that Mal and Zoe fought in, is implied to have been bloody enough that their infantry regiment (exact numbers unspecified but probably about two thousand soldiers) had about enough survivors to fill a _platoon_ by the time a ceasefire was called.
    -   Arguably, the entire setting springs from an example of this trope. Canon is vague about just how many people escaped Earth before it became Earth That Was, but since they were apparently travelling by Sleeper Starship and/or Generation Ships, it's safe to assume that they were a _very_ small fraction of the planet's total population.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   The Starks are reduced down to a few children by the end of Season 3. Fortunately, they have returned and reclaimed their home.
    -   By the finale of Season 6, this happens to a number of noble houses, namely the Tyrells, the Baratheons, the Martells, and the Boltons.
        -   In the Season 6 finale, Margaery, Loras, and Mace die when Cersei blows up the Sept of Baelor with them in it. Only Olenna is left alive, but since Olenna is a Redwyne by birth, the Tyrell bloodline is extinct. In the books, there are numerous minor Tyrell cousins (through Mace's two sisters, and old Lord Luthor's younger brothers). Some of the female cousins serve as Margaery's handmaidens. Even the TV series briefly acknowledged that other Tyrell cousins exist in Season 3 — one of them even had a speaking line and outright called Olenna "Nana" (grandmother). The _main branch_ of the family, however, is very clearly dead beyond recovery. With her death in Season 7, House Tyrell has been extinguished.
        -   At the end of Season 6, the Baratheon line is effectively extinguished. The legitimate ones were killed following the Battle of Winterfell, while the King's Landing branch (the three supposed offspring of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister) which is Baratheon in-name-only died one by one under different circumstances. Joffrey was poisoned for being a madman and a threat to the Tyrells, Myrcella was poisoned due to a potentially avoidable rivalry with Dorne thanks to Tywin Lannister allowing Gregor Clegane to kill Elia Martell years earlier (along with her brother's death when the two clashed), and Tommen committed suicide when his mother murdered all of her political adversaries (including his wife) with a massive explosion that killed hundreds (if not more) of his subjects. Ultimately, Lannister pettiness was the King's Landing branch's downfall, and only Joffrey could be said to have invited the fate brought upon him. All that's left of the once great house is an unknown number of bastard children fathered by Robert. Most of the known ones (except Gendry) were purged by King Joffrey in the beginning of his reign and unlikely to ever be legitimized by the current regime in order to not threaten it. As far as could be known, Gendry is the last Baratheon, and he's an unacknowledged bastard with no way to prove his lineage if anyone asked. In Season 8, Daenerys legitimizes Gendry.
        -   As of Season 6, House Martell is effectively extinct. The only Martells by blood are the Sand Snakes, but they're illegitimate and much-despised kinslayers. In Season 7, two of them are killed off by Euron Greyjoy while the third one is dying of poison in the Red Keep dungeons. While it is confirmed that Oberyn has eight bastard daughters, the five remaining ones are too young to take up the leadership, which left their House and rest of Dorne in a power vacuum. In Season 8, Varys confirms there's a new Prince of Dorne; however, he's never named in the show and it's unknown if he's a distant member of House Martell.
        -   At the end of Season 6, House Bolton is effectively extinct, with all their members being killed by Ramsay and him finally meeting his end after the Battle of the Bastards. Sansa confirms that their lands, name, and titles will be completely erased from history.
    -   In the Season 7 premiere, Arya Stark eradicated the entire male line of House Frey after she assassinated the patriarch, Walder Frey, in the Season 6 finale while sparing the women.
    -   At the end of Season 8, the once mighty and powerful House Lannister collapsed after Daenerys' forces decimated their armies. With Cersei and Jaime dead, Tyrion is the de facto Lord of Casterly Rock and the last Lannister alive.
    -   In Season 8, the two remaining members of House Mormont, Lyanna and Jorah, died during the Battle of the Dawn.
-   Boyd Crowder from _Justified_ gets a big dose of this when he returns to his camp to find all of his followers murdered by his father.
-   The AU movie for _Kamen Rider 555_, _Paradise Lost_. The number of humans alive doesn't even get close to the five-digit mark _at the start_.
-   _The Last Man on Earth_, self-explanatory. Though the title's still deceptive, since there are at least 7 other people left, but that still puts humanity down to one billionth of its old number.
-   _Life on Mars (2006)_/_Ashes to Ashes (2008)_: Everyone is already dead — bar Sam Tyler, and he later kills himself.
-   _Lost_:
    -   The first person the 815 survivors meet who was already on the island besides Ethan didn't come alone. She killed all of her companions for reasons we don't understand at first.
    -   Ben, acting on behalf of the Others, kills nearly all of the Dharma Initiative folks in "the Purge", using poisonous gas to wipe them out. It's a pretty chilling image.
    -   The Season 6 episode "Ab Aeterno" shows us what happened when the Black Rock crashed on the island. All concerned except that episode's POV character ended up dead within a few weeks.
    -   Everyone in the Flash Sideways who wasn't already dead died after living out the remainder of their lives offscreen.
    -   Only a handful of Flight 815 survivors and Others make it to the end of the series following the fire arrow attack in Season 5 and the Monster's purge of the Temple in Season 6, and the only known survivors of the Kahana are Miles and Lapidus.
-   Played for Laughs in the _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ episode "Gunslinger". In the movie viewed, many of the secondary characters and extras disappear just before the final shootouts that claims the lives of the main characters save for main heroine Rose. Joel and the Bots run with the idea that the entire town died in the final shootouts, leaving replacement sheriff Sam Bass with a pile of dead bodies.
-   Appears in _Power Rangers RPM_'s basic premise. Save for Corinth, the Domed Hometown City of Adventure, the entire planet is a dead empty wasteland, all inhabitants dead (a few refugees get to Corinth, of course, but obviously most don't).
-   _Red Dwarf_:
    -   Three million years after a nuclear reactor leak killed the crew of an interstellar mining ship, the only survivors of the pilot episode's disaster are the main characters. Well, one survivor (who was in Stasis during the leak). The other three protagonists are the ship's AI computer, an evolved, humanoid descendant of the main character's pet cat (and, therefore, not actually _born_ at the time of the disaster) and a holographic simulation of the main character's roommate. Why a hologram? Because he's dead, Dave. Being a comedy, the page quote (wherein Holly breaks the news and names the trope) quickly spirals into an Overly Long Gag — and the book adaptation's take ends with Holly ranting every possible grammatical combination of the words, "everyone", "is", "dead" and "Dave".
        
        **David Lister:** Rimmer?  
        **Holly:** He's dead, Dave. _Everybody's_ dead. _**Everybody. Is. Dead. Dave!**_  
        _\[Beat\]_  
        **Lister:** Wait... Are you trying to tell me everybody's dead?  
        **Holly:** ...Should have never let him out in the first place.
        
    -   In the novel _Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers_, Holly has to start rearranging the words and inflections in the hopes that some combination will get through to him, eventually succeeding after "Dead Dave, everybody is. Everybody is Dave, dead." When it finally does sink in, Lister's reaction... isn't pretty.
    -   At the start of the second series, the crew give a similar speech to Kryten, who hadn't realized his masters had been dead for centuries. Even after they tell him, it still takes a few minutes for it to register.
        
        **Kryten:** I was only gone for two minutes!
        
    -   In "Skipper", Rimmer travels to a parallel universe where the nuclear leak hasn't yet happened, and this trope is inverted, as Holly informs him "Nobody's dead" in much the same way that he did to Lister.
-   In the miniseries _The Stand (1994)_, the CDC office where Stu was imprisoned while The Plague was decimating the general population was adorned with the uplifting graffiti "All Dead Here".
-   In the _Stargate SG-1_ episode "2010", we find ourselves in a future where Earth has been manipulated by a seemingly friendly alien race who have shared their technology to improve human life. In reality, they have secretly plotted to take over the Earth by reducing the human population. Finding this out, SG-1 try to escape into the past through the stargate to warn the SGC — none survive the attempt, although Carter does manage to toss a note through just before she dies, and the warning makes it.
-   An episode of _Stargate Atlantis_ involves Sheppard being propelled tens of thousands of years into the future to find Atlantis long abandoned. An AI hologram of McKay tells him that the Wraith eventually forced them out of the Pegasus galaxy and that he must go back to his own time (no easy task) armed with foreknowledge of how to stop this chain of events from occurring.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
    -   In "Valiant", the titular ship, sister ship of _Defiant_, is destroyed, and the only survivors are Nog, Jake, and one girl — the rest of Red Squad dies.
    -   "The Siege of AR-558" ends with the main characters in addition to 10 or so soldiers alive — out of a 150-strong unit.
-   Similar to the _SG-1_ example above, another Alternate Universe gives us this. In the _Star Trek: Enterprise_ episode "Twilight", we see an alternate timeline in which the Xindi have succeeded in destroying the Earth and nearly every other Earth colony or human outpost. When the episode proper takes place, the retired Captain Archer is a resident of a small human colony of barely 20,000 and the _Enterprise_ herself is the last true capital ship humanity has. They do manage to undo this bleak turn of events, but they narrowly succeed as the Xindi lay siege to the last of humanity's ships, including nearly completely destroying the _Enterprise_.
-   _Supernatural_ has a few of these:
    -   In the episode "Croatoan", a town's population except the brothers and one doctor (not counting one kid who turns out to be working for the Big Bad) are wiped out.
    -   Another memorial episode is "Jus in Bello", in which the brothers could easily have stopped any more deaths just by allowing Ruby to sacrifice one virgin girl, who was prepared to be the sacrifice. Even for _Supernatural_, this episode has a Downer Ending...
    -   Season 5 has the episode "The End". 5 years into the future, Dean witnesses a zombie apocalypse where Bobby is dead, Lucifer possesses Sam's body, and possibly every other hunter he's ever known dead as well. All that's left is him, Castiel (who is self-destructing fast), and Chuck. At the end of the ep, future-Dean leads a suicide run at Lucifer wherein he sacrifices Castiel and everybody else he brought along with him except past-Dean. Lucifer kills him without effort and so, in the future, the only main character left is Chuck. This episode is put-a-gun-in-your-mouth-and-pull-the-trigger depressing.
    -   By the end of the Season 7 finale "Survival of the Fittest", Bobby is dead, as is the entire angelic garrison, Kevin and Meg have both been kidnapped by Crowley, Dean and Castiel have been zapped to purgatory, and this is on top of the high character attrition of the previous seasons. The last scene is of Sam standing alone in the wreck of the Big Bad's office.
        
        **Crowley:** Looks like you are well and truly on your own.
        
    -   In the second-to-last episode of the series, "Inherit the Earth", Chuck has already destroyed every other universe in the multiverse. He then wipes out all life in the remaining universe, leaving the Winchester Brothers and Jack Kline as the last surviving mortals in all of creation. Fortunately, once Chuck is stripped of his power and Jack becomes the new God, everything is restored to what it once was.
-   Both versions of _Survivors_ have Abby Grant waking up halfway through the first episode to find that her husband and all her neighbours are dead, issuing the famous plea "Please don't let me be the only one."
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_:
    -   "Time Enough at Last": Henry Bemis appears to be the only survivor of an atomic bomb. He despairs to the point of suicide until he realizes that now that his high-pressure, work-a-day life is over, he finally has enough time to read to his heart's content. Until...
    -   "One More Pallbearer": Subverted. Millionaire Paul Radin sets up a phony broadcast of a nuclear attack to trick three authority figures from his past into begging his forgiveness to be allowed into his bunker. They refuse his offer, preferring to die with dignity. Their rejection drives him insane, and he falls for his own hoax. He thinks the world has been destroyed by a nuclear holocaust, with him the only survivor, but he's really wandering the streets of the fully intact city, surrounded by people he can't see or hear.
-   One _The X-Files_ episode sees Mulder have a fever dream which ends with him lying in bed as an old man, with Cancer Man explaining that they're the only ones left — everyone else he knows is dead. Mulder looks out the window and sees a burning city that resembles Hell.

    Music

-   The Dutch novelty song _Dodenrit_ (roughly, "Sleigh ride of death") by Drs. P, about a Russian family (two adults, four children) in a troika on their way to Omsk, singing to pass the time as a pack of wolves begins to close in on them. One by one, the children are sacrificed to the wolves, then the wife, all of which is Played for Laughs ("How about Natasha?" "But she's doing so well in school!"). The final lines of the song have the narrator himself, while celebrating that he can see Omsk, slip and be devoured, observing that "Omsk is a lovely town, but just a little too remote."
-   "32 Down On The Robert Mackenzie" by Paul Gross, featured in an episode of _Due South_ of the same name, about a Great Lakes merchant ship with a crew of 32 men that ran aground and sank in a storm. The title comes from the last message sent by the ship. The song is about a shipwreck in the episode's backstory, but it was based on the Real Life sinking of the SS _Edmund Fitzgerald_.
-   And speaking of, "The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald", by Gordon Lightfoot.
-   The Les Savy Fav songs "Reformat" and "Reformat(Dramatic Reading), the latter a spoken piece in the style of a radio play, are about the captain of a diesel-powered submarine who pushes it beyond its capability and decides to use the crew's oxygen to power the sub long enough to surface. He kills anyone who tries to stop him and the rest die when the plan goes horribly wrong, leaving him the sole survivor. He is then executed by guillotine on live TV thanks to an obscure maritime law.

-   The radio version of _The War of the Worlds_ uses Deadline News repeatedly. Almost all the important characters are reporters. Guess what happens. (The survivor, incidentally, is the scientist thought to be among the first to die. You see, they Never Found the Body.)

    Tabletop Games 

-   Used to bleak effect in a couple of scenarios from a _Champions_ supplement dealing with alternate dimensions. In particular, in one the player characters arrive in their home city's counterpart in a world where Germany won WW2, developed nuclear weapons before anybody else did, and conquered the US. They run into and fight power armored patrols, get in touch with the local resistance, get sent to another city to speak with the real leaders there...then the Nazis, alarmed that there are still superpowered individuals despite all their heretofore effective-seeming efforts to exterminate them, drop a nuke on the city they just left. And then threaten to repeat that performance as necessary until the resistance surrenders for keeps...
-   Implied in _Paranoia_ — Friend Computer says everyone outside of Alpha Complex is dead!

    **Dean**: "All of them." \[beat\] "All of them."
    
-   In _The Golden Apple_, the Affably Evil Hector bids Ulysses a fond farewell at the end of the Big Spree, but not without a cynical reminder that all the rest of his crew have died or vanished.

    Video Games 

-   In _7 Days A Skeptic_, near the end, all of the characters are dead except for the player, and the homicidal frankenstein monster that killed the rest.
-   In _Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura_, you start out as the only surviving passenger of a zeppelin after its untimely crash. And depending on how you play and which options you pick during the endgame, you will end up the only living being in the entirety of Arcanum AND the Void.
-   In the last game of the _Sarge's Heroes_ continuity of _Army Men_ games, _Sarge's War,_ every major character from the previous games - all of Bravo Company, Sarge's love interest Vikki, Colonel Grimm and the series' former antagonist General Plastro - gets killed in the game's introduction by a hidden bomb explosion at a peace treaty signing, leaving Sergeant Hawk as the sole survivor of the series. The ending hints at the possibility of their revival or return via cloning, but this thread has remained unresolved, as 3DO filed for bankruptcy shortly before the game's launch and no future games by the new rights holders have returned to the _Sarge's Heroes_ story since.
-   _Asura's Wrath_: Mithra is the only character with a name left alive by the end of the game.
-   _Bastion_ has only four surviving Caelondians trying to undo The Calamity. until Zulf finds out exactly what the Calamity was _supposed_ to do...
-   Early in _Batman: Arkham Asylum_, you can find holdouts of Arkham Security or medical staff all over the island. Batman saves them from whatever peril and tells them to stay put where it's safe. This almost never works, as Batman finds them dead on his next trip through the area. By the end of the game Gordon, Cash, Sharp, Batman and a handful of guards and doctors look to be the only survivors of the nights' events.
-   _BattleZone II_ ends this way if you side with General Braddock. You murder your former commanding officer, wipe out a rebellion opposing Braddock's plans for dictatorship - killing Braddocks' former right-hand man, then you go on to commit genocide on a species. By the end, Braddock and you are the only named characters left alive.
-   _The Bunker_: John and his elderly mother Margaret are the only people alive in a fallout shelter that originally housed a little over 650 survivors of a nuclear war in the late 1980's, all of whom died when John was a child, leaving only him and his mother. She dies of old age in the opening minutes of the game, leaving John completely alone. This is because Margaret had killed everybody else using poison gas in the vents after it was discovered that the bunker didn't have enough food to last until it was possible to leave, leading to her resorting to drastic measures to save herself and her son. John had repressed all memory of the incident because of the trauma.
-   _Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare_ does this _twice_; first, when the nuclear warhead in Al-Asad's capital detonates, killing Lieutenant Vasquez, most of his squad, the Cobra pilot they were rescuing seconds earlier, and, a few minutes later, Sergeant Paul Jackson, the player character. Later on, "Soap" MacTavish is disabled by a gas tanker explosion, and forced to watch helplessly as Griggs is shot in the throat, Gaz is executed in the forehead by the Big Bad, and the rest of his surviving SAS/Marine unit is gunned down in cold blood by the Ultranationalists, right before Price slides him his Colt M1911 and lets Soap rip the badguys a new one. Talk about your Downer Ending. Soap and Price manage to survive, though their status in the first _Modern Warfare_ was left up in the air prior to the sequel.
    -   In _Modern Warfare 2_, everyone in Task Force 141 except for Soap and Price are dead by the end.
    -   Price is the only recurring main character to survive the entire trilogy.
-   In "Episode 0: Allocation" of _Code 7_ you eventually find a room where the corpses of the entire Schrödinger Station crew are perfectly lined up on the floor, with injection marks on their necks and their brains extracted. You and Sam are the only humans left on the station and your humanity is ... unclear.
-   Implied by the ending of the bonus chapter (only found in the collector's edition of the game) of _Dark Tales: Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher_. Taking the entirety of the story into account, it is very heavily suggested that the only survivors of the events are the player character and his/her partner, Dupin.
-   In _Dead Rising_, if you follow the plot missions, just before the finale the Special Forces will have killed every single survivor and zombie in the mall except you and Isabella. You make your final run to the helipad alone with the mall completely lifeless.
-   In _Dead Rising 2_, the clock initially counts down to when the military arrives. Once they do, they're slaughtered by souped up zombies. The only survivor is Sgt. Boykin, who goes insane and believes his squad is still alive. The second clock counts down to a firebombing by the military which presumably kills every living and undead thing in the area, possibly including the player character depending on the player's actions beforehand.
-   _Dead Space_ follows the tradition with a massive ship drifting in space and its crew turned into monsters. The few survivors you see either kill themselves, or murder each other in truly disturbing ways. Plus the ones who bleed to death in front of you or the one who is actually killed by accident.
-   Subverted in _Dead Space 2_. We can see massive evacuation at the beginning of the game. It's highly probable that many people made it, they were just gone before Isaac woke up.
-   In _Dead to Rights_, Jack is the sole survivor at the end.
-   _Devil Survivor 2_:
    -   The base game has an all-but-bluntly-put moment near the end of the game, when Yamato tells the other party members that , in order for Polaris to change the world, all of mankind's desire must be the same. The entire party consists of twelve people. The rest of humanity is _gone_.
    -   Record Breaker has Daichi's nightmare on Wednesday. He's crawling around a destroyed location and calling out for his teammates, but nobody is answering. The camera pans around and shows the other party members lying motionless on the ground, all of them dead. And then Daichi turns and reveals a bleeding stomach wound. It turns out that this isn't just a bad dream, this _actually_ happened during the second cycle of the world, with _Record Breaker_ taking part during the third cycle.
-   _Doom_:
    -   This sets the stage for the first _Doom_, when the hero is the only surviving member of a squad of marines sent to _two_ survivorless moons (overrun by demons go figure) and then _Hell._
    -   _Doom II_: Happens where the hero is the last man _on Earth_ (sans a lone escaping spaceship).
    -   _Doom³_: At the conclusion of the game, the nameless protagonist is the only survivor. Every single NPC he has met over the course of the game has met their end through one way or another. And it occurs once more with the protagonist of _Resurrection of Evil_, though McNeil may have survived.
    -   In _Doom (2016)_, the only survivors are the Doom Slayer and Samuel Hayden.

-   Something like this happens in _Dragon Age: Origins_ in the beginning with the Grey Wardens at Ostagar. Although most of the order join the King and his army on the battlefield against the darkspawn, two have been selected for a separate mission away from the fighting: the player character and another junior Warden named Alistair. The battle is a complete massacre because the King's father-in-law, Loghain, ordered his troops to retreat instead of coming to help, and the player and Alistair are only saved due to intervention by a sort-of supernatural ally. They awaken a few days after the battle and are greeted with the news that they are the only surviving Grey Wardens in the entire country, and the responsibility for stopping the darkspawn is entirely on their shoulders. This is also seen earlier in the game if you choose the Human Noble origin. During the backstory, the family castle is invaded and everyone inside is slaughtered. Only the player character and his/her dog escape.
-   _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_: Yagrum Bagarn had this happen to him in the backstory. He was a Dwemer explorer who returned from an expedition to an outer realm to find that his species had done _something_ that wiped them off the face of Mundus.
-   At the beginning of _Fallout 4_, the appropriately titled Sole Survivor is the only resident of Vault 111 (other than their kidnapped son) to leave the vault alive, with their spouse having been shot by the kidnappers and the rest of the vault dwellers killed by Cryonics Failure. By the end of the game, their son is dead too, either being killed or dying from terminal cancer.
-   _Final Fantasy_
    -   During the course of _Final Fantasy II_, the towns around Fynn are subject to various hardships, from the initial assault of Imperial soldiers to aerial bombardment by the airship Dreadnought; after each, the party listens to shellshocked townspeople lament the death of their loved ones. Except after the Cyclone. After _that_, every town but Fynn and a few far-distant places is literally wiped off of the map. A grey patch remains in the place the town once stood, but the party can't enter it because there is nothing left _to_ enter and no survivors.
    -   In _Final Fantasy VI_, after The End of the World as We Know It (which is roughly the midway point of the game; yeah, it's that kind of story), Celes wakes a year later to find herself and Cid on a tiny godforsaken spit of land. There are no other humans, all the animals are dead or slowly dying, and there is nothing visible to suggest that any other land survived the apocalypse. Truly the end of the world. Cid explains that all of the other survivors committed suicide in despair before too long. If Cid dies, Celes, seemingly the last human alive, jumps from the cliff like all the others. However, she survives, and a dove with a familiar bandanna tied to it gives her enough hope to try and find other survivors and other continents. Turns out that not everyone was dead after all. It's still close to that level of despair, though. If the player manages to save Cid, this doesn't happen, and instead he convinces Celes that she ought to take the raft he's made and check if there are any survivors on the mainland.
    -   In _Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time_, your Player Character eventually finds that this is the _backstory_ of the village. Larkeicus' Mooks slaughtered all of its inhabitants a thousand years ago because the village was the pathway to the world's last crystal. The people you were raised by were created by the villagers' spirits so that you could have a normal life; you eventually find the _original_ village, which is a burnt-out ruin. After you learn the truth and start fighting Larkeicus, they allow themselves to fade away.
    -   In _Final Fantasy Tactics_ every character in the game who had a name and was ever slightly important winds up dead, with maybe a half a dozen exceptions. Considering the population in this game, that's an impressive genocide. Notable exceptions are the main character and his sister, who are shown surviving the final battle. And presumably everyone in his party.
    -   By the end of _Final Fantasy Type-0_, the only surviving characters among the main cast are Machina, Rem, Joker and Tiz. You only find out about the latter two during the New Game Plus.
-   _Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn_ has this at the end of Part 3. The Big Bad's judgement has turned about 99% of the world's population to stone. The major characters note how the battlefield they were in the middle of has turned eerily quiet, and Ike runs outside, screaming for someone to reply to him.
-   _Halo_:
    -   Twice in _Halo: Combat Evolved_. Before the game even starts, the human military capital of Reach is bombed into molten glass, with the _Pillar of Autumn_ being one of the few ships to escape. By the end of the game, the titular ring-world is blown up, and pretty much everyone on it dies; the final cutscene has the Master Chief and his trusty AI Cortana searching in vain for other survivors. While _Halo: First Strike_ reveals that Sergeant Johnson and a handful of others also managed to survive both Reach and Halo, the book ends with only a small fraction of even those few survivors making it back alive to Earth.
    -   In _Halo 4_, "Composer" ends with the Didact using the Composer to kill everyone aboard Ivanoff Station, with Chief and Cortana being the only two to survive.
-   The same thing also happens in _Halo_'s spiritual predecessor _Marathon_: after you save the titular colony ship from the Pfhor in the first game, the sequel reveals that during the intervening years, the Pfhor came back while you were gone and virtually nuked the Marathon to oblivion. The final game ends with only a few dozen humans from the colony still alive.
    -   The even earlier _Pathways into Darkness_ (Which _Marathon_ is a Stealth Sequel to) starts with you Late to the Tragedy, with the rest of your team having been killed already.
-   Quite possible in several ending combinations in _Heavy Rain_: Not saving Shaun alone kills Ethan AND Norman in their epilogues if they hadn't died already.
-   Unless you go for a Pacifist Run, the remaining Tasen in _Iji_ get wiped out by Iosa shortly before you confront General Tor. Averted on a Pacifist Run, where you fight Iosa _before_ she has a chance to kill the Tasen. Depending on your playstyle, two Tasen might escape the massacre but since they are both female, the whole species is doomed anyway if you don't stop Iosa.
-   In the bad endings of _Insanity_, Keisuke is the last protagonist living and begins losing his mind as a result.
-   _Knights of the Old Republic II_ opens with the player character awakening in a mining facility with everybody else dead except for an old woman who had been in a hibernation trance and a man who was forgotten in the detention area.
    
    -   You were supposed to be responsible for the deaths of nearly everyone in your party, but it was cut due to time restraints. If you go evil, you _almost_ kill _everyone in the galaxy_.
    -   And let's not forget that the Jedi have been driven to extinction with just three remaining in hiding. None of those three survive the game, meaning if you go Dark Side, the Jedi are completely extinct by the end.
    
    **Kreia:** Your actions have crippled the Order, perhaps destroyed them. - Stay here and die, apprentice, among the wreckage of all that remains of the Jedi. It is a fitting grave until the Sith come to end you... to end everything.
    
-   In _Left 4 Dead_, the four survivors are some of the only people not turned into zombies. The only other people that appear in-game are a man locked up in a church (who quickly turns into a zombie himself), and the people that come to rescue the survivors at the end of each campaign.
    -   Even their rescuers often come to bad ends in the first game. The survivors are truly fortunate to be immune to both infection and helicopter crashes.
-   This is the fate of the "God of Destruction" Alex in one of the Multiple Endings of Nippon Ichi's _Makai Kingdom_. He wants to destroy everything; he succeeds. And is left alone in an empty universe, too powerful to kill himself.
    -   A very similar thing happens in the Demon Path of _Soul Nomad & the World Eaters_. Except you're the one who destroys everything, and when the fabric of the world is undone, you go along with it.
-   This is your character's Backstory if you select the "Sole Survivor" (Shepard's squad was all killed by a Thresher Maw) and "Colonist" (everyone else was either killed or abducted by Batarian slavers) backgrounds in _Mass Effect_. For bonus points, your character can have BOTH. And then BioWare had a lot of fun with this trope in the sequel:
    -   Inverted: In the beginning of the game, Shepard and 21 crew members on the Normandy are killed, though most escaped.
    -   Subverted: In the worst ending of the game, Shepard's entire team and crew dies but it looks like Shepard him/herself will survive... and then s/he falls to his/her death... thus, leaving Joker the sole (organic) survivor of the Suicide Mission.
    -   When the Collectors kidnap the crew, this is definitely the feeling when you walk around the empty _Normandy._ Yeoman Kelly telling you about the messages at your private terminal, the officers in the crew quarters concerned about their families, the cook, the doctor, Those Two Guys down in Engineering... All part of the ship's atmosphere and suddenly gone. And depending on how fast you head through the Omega 4 relay, they could really become dead.
    -   In ME3, it's entirely possible for most of the former squadmates and other important characters from the first two games to have already died, or who die during this game, leaving you with a potential squad of only three members and the NPC roles to be filled by other minor characters or missing entirely.
    -   According to Zaeed Massani's stories, this trope happens to him every Tuesday.
-   In _Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne_, the only non-Max character of any import to live through to the end of the game is Jim Bravura, who happened to take a few bullets to the torso first. Though, if the player completes the game on the hardest difficulty setting, Mona survives, too.
-   When you arrive aboard the station in _Metroid Fusion_, every member of the station's crew is already dead from X Parasite infection.
-   In _Mortal Kombat 3_, Stryker is the lone survivor of the destruction of an unspecified major city.
-   Happens several times over in _NieR: Automata_, and the three biggest are all plot-relevant:
    -   First, Humanity is actually long extinct, meaning YoRHa and Androids as a whole are fighting for an empty cause.
    -   Second, the Bunker is destroyed, almost every YoRHa android is wiped out by the Logic Virus, and 2B suffers a Mercy Kill, leaving 9S all alone — something that is _not_ good for his mental state.
    -   Lastly, as of the end of the game, a total of two named characters survive. The sum total of surviving characters are them, a handful of Resistance stragglers, and certain player characters depending on the exact ending.
-   The "Submarine" ending of _Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors_ ends with all of the other players apparently stabbed and dead. Then you get knifed...
    -   Technically all of the endings aside from the True Ending are this. No matter who the killer is in the ending, they will be unable to unlock the final door.
    -   The sequel does this no less than three times. In Luna's path, Sigma and Phi find everyone dead, except for Quark, who's missing. In Clover's ending, Sigma finds everybody's (except for, once again, Quark's) dead bodies. And in Phi's route, Tenmyouji reveals that most of the human population of Earth has been killed by the Radical-6 pandemic.
-   _The Orion Conspiracy_ starts off with 20 characters on a space station. By the end of the game, Devlin, Meyer, and LaPaz are the only characters still alive.
-   In _Penny Arcade: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness: Episode Two_, near the end of the game, the Big Bad comes in and kills everybody at the robotics convention off... even the beloved characters from the first game... even the characters you had JUST finished side-questing for. As Gabe and Tycho would probably say, "Shit just got real."
-   _Pico's School_ opens with a school shooting. By the time gameplay begins, the only three survivors aside from the perpetrators are Pico, Nene and someone who hid in one of the toilet stalls — and the latter two can potentially die.
-   _Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon_: By the end of Chapter 16, with the exception of Ampharos and Jirachi, everyone in the Expedition Society, including the player and partner characters, have been turned to stone by Yveltal and its followers, who then precede to petrify almost everyone else on the planet, including most of the Legendary Pokémon.
-   _Red Faction_: Only Parker and Eos survive.
    -   _Red Faction II_: Only survivors are Alias, Shrike, and Tangier (if you get a good enough karma rating).
        -   _Red Faction: Guerrilla_: Only Mason and Samanya survive. Are we seeing a pattern here?
-   Most of the first _Resident Evil_ has Jill or Chris wandering a zombie-infested mansion with only one person to aid them depending on which one, finding out that everyone they went in to look for in the first place is dead or dying except Rebecca.
    -   HUNK is notorious in-universe for being the only person to survive his missions. One of the bonus ending screens in _Resident Evil 3: Nemesis_ has a chopper pilot getting sarcastic about it: "Once again, only _you_ survive, Mr. Death." _Chronicles_ shows that he prefers it that way.
    -   Speaking of RE:3, in both the original and the remake, the main storyline ends the same way: only Jill and Carlos survive. Oh, and canonically, Nikolai.
-   At the end of the first _Sakura Wars_, as your party marches through the Seimajou, they are killed off one by one, until only Ogami and your chosen love interest remain. The player then either has to kill the traitor (Ayame) or watch her sacrifice herself to save you. Then, after you beat the Big Bad, he reveals himself to be the devil. Ogami despairs that he can't go on without the rest of the party, then Ayame as an angel shows up and they get revived.
-   The original _Shellshock: Nam 67_' ends this way, since the only significant characters to survive to the very end of the game (unless you count your first CO, who leaves when his tour of duty is up midway through the game) are the Player Character and Monty.
-   _Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne_. The End of the World as We Know It takes place within the first ten to fifteen minutes (depending on how fast you read.) On the entire planet, only the five humans at the Shinjuku Hospital (and one Intrepid Reporter) escape the horror of the Conception, an apocalyptic event which destroyed the world outside Tokyo and turned the city into the Vortex World. All other humans, everywhere have died, and they have either become helpless ghosts who can only hope demons don't eat them, or their souls have been reduced to raw emotional energy called "Magatsuhi"... which demons crave to enhance their own powers. By the end of the game, not one true human exists anymore.
-   This is one of the worst endings you can get in the third game of _Splatterhouse_.
-   In _Strike Suit Zero_, pretty much the entire Earth fleet has been wiped out, without the single loss of an enemy ship.
-   _Sunset Over Imdahl_ begins with one of these. The main character's mother has just died of The Plague, and he leaves his house to find the rest of the city has followed suit. Then a strange man with a time portal gives him a chance to Set Right What Once Went Wrong...
-   Used in _Super Paper Mario_ when a rather cute samurai-Japan gets sucked into The Void. You survive, but upon going back to the world you find this blank white space, with the occasional piece of broken building or debris.
    -   Also used in _Super Mario Galaxy_. The ending sees the destruction of the entire universe, save for the Mario Brothers and Rosalina. It gets re-created; but those three are still the only survivors of the original universe - Everyone else wasn't actually saved, but reincarnated.
-   _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_: The adventure mode, World of Light, _opens_ with the trope, as an angelic evil being called Galeem proceeds to _disintegrate almost every single fighter with one attack as well as several other characters_, with only Kirby barely managing to survive. Fortunately, the rest of the cast isn't "dead" per se, and merely trapped in limbo in spirit form, which means Kirby has a chance to save them all.
-   Both _System Shock_ and _System Shock 2_ kill almost every single NPC aboard the station/ship besides the nameless player. There's a group of survivors in the first game, but they are wiped out before the player can reach them. In the sequel, the ending cutscene shows SHODAN taking control of Rebecca Siddons and menacing Tommy Suarez (presumably killing him).
    -   It's particularly annoying in the second game: you actually see quite a number of survivors, only they die before you can meet them, sometimes while you watch haplessly through the window. Tommy and Rebecca example is even worse. You run to escape pods bay only to find they're just boarding a pod as the glass door you are behind opens slowly enough, so you can't reach them before they leave.
    -   In _System Shock_'s Spiritual Successor _BioShock_, the main character is the only survivor of a plane wreck that he caused in the opening sequence. Rapture itself may qualify, as nearly everyone you encounter is either dead, homicidally insane (and killed by the main character during the game), or no longer truly human. _BioShock 2_ reveals that there were a few others who survived, and that even the splicers went on to be partially rehabilitated... before joining a sinister cult, whose leader happens to want the protagonist dead.
-   _Theresia: Dear Emile_ is, in essence, a Beautiful Void without the beauty. There are an a lot of rotting corpses, but if anyone else is still living (and setting those traps that keep targetting you), they're awfully good at keeping out of sight.
-   Many of the NPCs in _Treasure of the Rudra_ die out around day 10 Due to Sodom's Moonlight. The ones who are smart enough stay inside, away from getting fried by it. The Residents of the Netherworld are completely safe aside from the wandering souls who return to Gafu.
-   In the 2008 reboot of _Turok_, there are three survivors of literally the entire cast: Slade, Shepard, and Turok.
-   _The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang_, late in the game, has a rare villainous example:
    
    **Von Hesler**: Hydra, summon all of my officers and have their troops surround the castle.  
    **Hydra**: Sir...  
    **Von Hesler**: What?  
    **Hydra**: They have all been defeated.  
    **Von Hesler**: All of the officers?  
    **Hydra**: Yes. Except for those of us here.
    
-   In Episode 4 of _Umineko: When They Cry_, everyone except Battler is killed within the first day.
-   The result if the "No Mercy" (commonly referred to as "Genocide") run in _Undertale_. You (the protagonist) hunt down and slaughter (nearly) every monster in the Underground, then make (or are forced to make) a deal with a long-dead corrupted child to completely obliterate what's left.
-   _Warriors Orochi 3_ opens with every single _Dynasty Warriors_ and _Samurai Warriors_ character except for Ma Chao, Sima Zhao, and Hanbei Takenaka dead after the appearance of a monstrous multi-headed Hydra. The thrust of the game is to travel back in time and save those characters from their deaths in order to amass a large enough army to defeat the Hydra once and for all.
-   _the white chamber_, regardless of the three main endings, drives the point home that Sarah murdered the entire crew, and she is the only one still alive, everything that seemed to be alive that she had encountered was a complete illusion.
-   World of Warcraft: On your arrival on the Alliance gunship in Deepholm.
    -   In _Legion_, this seems to be the fate of every human living in Duskwood, one way or another, when you retrieve the Kingslayer daggers as an Assassination Rogue. Either the cult sacrifices them or you kill the cultists. No one else is left.
-   _Unreal_: You start off on the Vortex Rikers that has recently crashed, with corpses of both prisoners and prison guards strewn all over the place. Screams of the dying echo throughout the ship.

    Webcomics 

-   _Deep Rise_: The face of the earth is no longer a face.
    
    **Eurayle:** No...
    
    **Cheertwit:** What is the matter, bad news?
    
    **Eurayle:** Dead... all of them...
    
    **Cheertwit:** A settlement was lost? How many died?
    
    **Eurayle:** All of them.
    
    **Cheertwit:** What do you mean, all of them?
    
    **Narrator:** Nine-hundred and eighty-two-million three-thousand and sixteen ape casualties.
    
-   Something similar happens to the unfortunate Rina in _The Dragon Doctors_. The young lady is turned to stone for two thousand years and is devastated to learn everyone she's ever known is dead. Kili the shaman also went through a similar experience; as a kid, everyone but Kili in Kili's town was killed by a tsunami, leaving Kili to wander the beach looking for survivors and screaming at the sky when none were found.
-   This is the likely ending of _Homestuck_ — since four kids and their guardians are the only (presumed) living humans left.
    
    -   Also during the Bad Future, where John and Jade have been killed. Considering that the only two people left are Rose and Dave, it is likely that this particular line was actually uttered, off-screen.
    -   And what happens to the Troll race, leaving only their Empress (plus the players) alive.
    -   Uttered almost word-for-word by Dirk's auto-responder — so precisely that it's almost definitely a Shout-Out.
    
    TT: Everybody's dead, Jake.
    
    TT: Dirk's dead, Jake. Jane's dead. Roxy? She's dead, Jake. Everybody is dead, Jake.
    
    -   And again when John stumbles into the aftermath of an even larger massacre. Nearly all the protagonists are dead, and Terezi is breaking the news to him. Funnily enough, one of the dead characters is named Dave.
-   _Nebula_: Everyone in the star system but Virginis and B has been dead for a long, _long_ time, and it's implied that Virginis (the only one old enough to remember the others and what happened to them) lashes out at B partially from grief.
-   In the first arc of _The Order of the Stick_, when Celia is turned back to normal (having been turned to stone by the villains), Nale (the leader of said villains, now captured by the heroes) informs her that she's been stone for a thousand years, and everyone she's known and loved are long dead! She blasts him when she finds out he's lying, but he still thinks it was "Worth It".
-   _Outsider_: Alex Jardin, a lowly ensign on the human scout ship _Bellarmine_, ends up being the Sole Survivor after _Bellarmine_ is attacked and destroyed by an unknown assailant. This leaves him stranded hundreds of light years from Earth, and the only human in alien-controlled space, having been rescued by a Loroi warship.
-   In _Ow, my sanity_, Dave's whole dorm is killed in the summoning ritual, from spree killings to sacrifices.
-   In _Retro Blade_ the story begins in the year 3007, where Axel and his sister Alexis are the last known survivors of the reality crash. This trope reaches its full capacity when Alexis dies.
-   Pretty much every supporting character in the _Sluggy Freelance_ story arcs "KITTEN" and "KITTEN II" is killed off or rendered catatonic. There's also the "GOFOTRON Champion of the Cosmos" arc, which ends with _the entire Punyverse_ being blown up.

    Web Original 

-   In the flash series _Bunny Kill_, main character Snowball is always the _only_ one left alive at the end of each installment. No exceptions.
-   _Domina_: When a sound-based virus turns the entire city into superpowered zombies, Adam manages to survive by deafening himself, then escapes. MC guides him to a place of relative safety, and then he asks where he should meet up with the other survivors. She sadly says there are no other survivors, and details how the zombies managed to overwhelm every single defense in the city.
    
    **MC:** You are currently the last living, sane person in Domina City.
    
-   In _Off-White,_ Gebo and Kaya both go through this.
-   The SCP Foundation has SCP-451, a former Foundation agent who _thinks_ he's the last human on Earth due to a Perception Filter which prevents him from perceiving other humans, any of their actions, or any of their attempts to communicate with him.
-   In each season of _Survival of the Fittest_, only one character is left standing when everything is finished.
    -   Also, in season one, Adam Dodd becomes the only survivor of the "Intrepid Six" after the other five members bite it one by one, culminating in Cody Jenson's infamous crossing of the Moral Event Horizon in which Madelaine Shirohara is raped and murdered, and Adam's love interest Amanda Jones is gunned down in an attempt to kill someone else. This leads to Adam not only suffering a Heroic BSoD for a while afterward, but swearing vengeance upon Cody and going on a deadly hunt for him, taking down everyone who tries to kill him or generally gets in his way, which, along with a heaping helping of Deus ex Machina, would eventually lead to him becoming the winner of the first season.
-   The Season 2 finale of _We're Alive_. As the Tower collapses:
    
    **Kelly**: Who was still in there?
    
    **Michael**: **Everyone!**
    

    Western Animation 

-   Jake teases Finn with this at the end of an _Adventure Time_ episode.
    
    **Jake**: Finn! Oh, my Glob, man, everyone's _dead_, man! They're all _burned!_ There's barbecue'd bods EVERYWHERE!  
    **Finn**: WHAT??!!!  
    **Jake**: I was just kidding. I saved them. Everyone's fine, see? \*points to group of alive and well Goblins\*
    
-   This is the situation Aang finds himself in when he wakes up from his 100-year sleep. All of his people, the Air Nomads, have been completely wiped out by the Fire Nation, and almost all of the friends he had in other nations died, if nothing else, of old age.
-   At the end of _The Family That Dwelt Apart_, adapted from the short story by E. B. White, when Charles Pruitt returns from an appendectomy operation in Baltimore, he finds that his brother Chester died from eating dried apricots too soon after his own appendectomy, and his mom, dad, and the other Pruitts used a radio transmitting hut as an emergency shelter, and they died from drinking carbolic acid, which their dad mistook for grain alcohol.
-   In the pilot episode of _Futurama_, Fry awakens in the future and realizes that his family, his co-workers and his girlfriend are all long since gone. After a moment of reflection... he lets out a jubilant "Yahoo!" Softened considerably by the fact that they weren't, so far as Fry knows, Killed Horribly; they're dead because of the natural human tendency not to live 1000+ years.
    
    -   And in the last movie, "Into the Wild Green Yonder", after yet another mass-death on Zapp Brannigan's ship, which only he and Kif survive.
    
    **Zapp:** "How many men did we lose?"  
    **Kif:** "...All of them."  
    "Well, at least they won't have to mourn each other!"
    
    -   " Ho ho ho! Everyone's dead! Stay tuned for another tale of holiday hilarity!"
    -   "The Late Philip J. Fry", when Fry, Bender and Farnsworth travel to a future where everyone is dead. They pass a couple of less total apocalypses on their way to the end of the world, and eventually go onward past the recreation of the Universe and the birth and death of everyone in it. _Twice._
    
    **Prof. Farnsworth:** Everyone we ever knew died hundreds of years ago.  
    **Bender:** Everyone we ever knew? Eh, I never liked those guys.
    
    -   In the _Beast With A Billion Backs_ movie, every living being in the Universe goes to a parallel dimension which is totally not exactly like Heaven, leaving only Bender and his fellow robots in the "living" world.
    -   Yet another example: one of the "What If Machine" episodes shows what would happen if Fry hadn't come to the future. The entire Universe is devoured by a black hole; Fry and his celebrity companions inexplicably survive in the remaining nothingness.
-   In _Gargoyles_, by the end of the episode "Future Tense" there are only two main characters left living. However, it was All Just a Dream.
    -   The whole premise of the show also qualifies. The titular Gargoyles are the only survivors of their once much larger tribe, which was wiped out centuries ago. Which seems much more recent to them on account of the curse that left them frozen in stone for all that time.
-   Curiously enough, even invoked in _**My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic**_ during its fifth season finale. Twilight Sparkle and Starlight Glimmer do battle in the past a few times, and each time Twilight fails to Set Right What Once Went Wrong. Each time, she returns to the present to find one of the previous villains has succeeded in taking over the world. Each time, that is, except the last; in that one, she takes Starlight back with her, and the only thing we see is a panorama of grey, decaying landscape. The only reason they don't outright say that everyone was murdered is because the target audience is a bunch of little girls. Thankfully, Starlight completes her Heel–Face Turn and everything goes back to the way it was.
-   Parodied in _The Simpsons_ episode "Maximum Homerdrive", when Homer and Bart watch a movie entitled _The Thing that Ate Everybody_, which contains the following exchange;
    
    **Woman:** You mean, it ate Patrick?  
    **Man:** It ate _everybody._  
    **Woman:** What about Erika?  
    **Man, Homer and Bart:** It ate _everybody_!  
    **Homer:** _Stupid!_
    
-   The _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ episode "Same As It Never Was" a Bad Future tale set thirty years in the future, features the final battle between the turtles (and their surviving allies) and the Shredder, who has conquered the world. In the end, the only surviving cast members are resistance leader April O' Neil and present-day Donatello, who soon after is whisked away to another era.
-   In _Transformers: Beast Machines_, it _seems_ like everyone's dead, but as the series progresses the planet's fate is revealed to be far more surreal: the entire populace of the planet has had their sparks (robot souls, essentialy) forcibly extracted and placed in containers.

    Other 

-   Similar to the _Men in Tights_ parody, one story (framed as a country song setting in _The Big Book of Urban Legends_) starts with a sheriff telling his friend who just returned from a trip that his dog had died... because of eating too much horse flesh... due to the barn burning... because of the house fire... because of the candles at his mother-in-law's funeral... who died due to seeing his wife run off with another man...
    
    Farmer: So I'm going to have to raise three children without their mother?!  
    Sheriff: Heck no, your kids all died in the fire!
    

    Real Life 

-   Around 550 BC, Sparta got into a conflict with Argos which they decided to settle in the so-called Battle of the 300 Champions. Each side sent only its 300 finest soldiers to the fight, and the outcome was meant to decide the whole war. Only one Spartan and two Argive soldiers survived. The requirements of the fight called for one side to be entirely destroyed, and the fact that the one spartan lived came from one of the biggest Failed a Spot Check in Greek history. The Spartans loopholed their way out of that embarrassment and won the war anyways.
-   Remember the Alamo.
-   The Battle of Little Bighorn. The five companies of the 7th Cavalry led by Custer were so severely wiped out that the only American survivor of the battle was a _horse_.
-   Pickett's Charge from Gettysburg, (as under films, above). The Confederates moved in on the Union position assuming the Union had stopped firing their cannons because they were overheated. They weren't. It was such a slaughter that the creek ran red with blood. For some units only a small handful of people showed up for roll call the next morning.
    -   When Pickett himself was ordered to reform his division after the charge, he responded with "I have no division" (or words to that effect).
-   The Battle of Stalingrad: 230,000 soldiers of the German 6th Army were trapped in the pocket of Stalingrad. Only 6,000 survived the battle and the labour camps to return to Germany after the war.
-   The diary of Tanya Savicheva during the Siege of Leningrad.
    
    Zhenya died on Dec. 28th at 12:00 P.M. 1941  
    Grandma died on Jan. 25th 3:00 P.M. 1942  
    Leka died on March 17th at 5:00 A.M. 1942  
    Uncle Vasya died on Apr. 13th at 2:00 after midnight 1942  
    Uncle Lesha on May 10th at 4:00 P.M. 1942  
    Mother on May 13th at 7:30 A.M. 1942  
    Savichevs died.  
    Everyone died.  
    Only Tanya is left.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
-   The retreat from Kabul in 1842 is a strong contender for the worst military disaster in the history of the British Army. 4,500 troops and 12,000 civilians left the city on the 6th of January, intending to regroup with the garrison at Jalalabad. A week later, surgeon William Brydon rode into Jalalabad alone, suffering from a severe head wound. When asked about the rest of the army, Brydon replied, "I am the army." A few dozen captives and stragglers trickled in over the next days, but the vast majority of the column was annihilated by the Afghans.
-   Archeology seems to suggest that there was a period around the last Ice Age where the entire human population got whittled down to only a few _thousand_ people. You can just imagine the number of deaths involved.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   On the morning of May 8, 1902, the city of Saint-Pierre on the French island of Martinique had a population of around 30,000 people. Then the nearby volcano Mount Pelée erupted and sent a pyroclastic flow into the city. When it was over, only two (possibly three) people survived. Interestingly, one of the survivors later survived _two other_ instances in which pyroclastic flows from Mount Pelée killed nearly everyone but him; he died in 1936, from a fall.
-   When the Bismarck fired on the Hood, one shell passed through seven decks and hit a powder magazine. Of the 1,500 sailors on board, _three_ survived. Hood's escort, the Prince Of Wales, could do nothing but run. Similar "instant death" occurrences happened in World War I, notably at the Battle of Jutland, where three British battlecruisers suffered catastrophic magazine explosions from single hits.
-   Jonestown, where Apocalypse Cult leader Jim Jones massacred over 900 of his followers in a ritual murder-suicide. Only a handful survived, in some cases by playing dead.
-   The murderous Khmer Rouge ran the infamous Tuol Sleng prison (also known as Security Prison 21). Over 18,000 men, women, and children were imprisoned there. Twelve survived.
-   This famous graph<small>◊</small> of Napoleon's retreat from Russia illustrates just how few French soldiers made it home alive. The width of the brown line shows the number marching towards Moscow; the width of the black line shows how many men survived the retreat. "When the remnants of Napoleon's army crossed the Berezina River in November, only 27,000 fit soldiers remained; the Grand Armée had lost some 380,000 men dead and 100,000 captured."
-   In WWI and previous wars, men were regimented by village. So it was not unusual that when a trench or regiment was wiped out, that was all the men in your village.
-   The Battle of Tarawa pitted an estimated 3,000-man garrison of the Special Naval Landing Force of the Imperial Japanese Navy against an 18,000 invasion force of US Marines on a heavily defended island in the Central Pacific. By the time the battle was over the Marines had suffered nearly two thousand dead, while only _**seventeen**_ Japanese were alive to surrender, alongside 129 Korean laborers.
-   Many island sieges in the Pacific tended to end this way, thanks in no small part to the Japanese military's distaste for surrender and their doctrine of fighting to the last man in the hopes of incurring as many Allied casualties in the process. Of the 21,000 Japanese garrison who fought at Iwo Jima, only 216 were taken prisoner, while other survivors would hide within the island before surrendering years after the end of the war.
-   The first ever circumnavigation of the Earth was achieved by a crew led by Ferdinand Magellan. The expedition left Spain in 1519 with 270 crew aboard five ships. After experiencing mutinies, starvation, scurvy, storms, and hostile encounters with indigenous people, the expedition returned in 1522 with only 18 crew aboard one ship, with Magellan himself having died in the Philippines.

"Wait a minute... are you trying to tell me everybody's _dead_?!"

"Yes, they are, Ji-- er, Dave."
