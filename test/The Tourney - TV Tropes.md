14th century jousting — notice how the ladies are loving it. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

_"By a knight of ghosts and shadows  
I summoned am to tourney,  
Ten leagues beyond the wide world's end —  
Methinks it is no journey."_

— **Tom o'Bedlam's Song**

When knights were bold, they fought not only in battle but in tourneys. Originally this was a melee — divided into two sides, the knights proceeded to go at each other with great vigor and frequent deaths. As time went on, the more familiar jousting was added; by the time of the Renaissance, jousts often dominated, along with other entertainments, especially highly stylized pageantry. (The original tournaments, named so for the way the horses would turn to do the next pass at arms.)

Not surprisingly, this often features in fiction with knights from the Chivalric Romance onward. Usually just jousting, and fairly innocuously — deaths are treated as rare freak accidents. Though the jousting can also contain hidden rivalries, or even be Trial by Combat. In some cases, a princess or great lady will marry the victor.

The Black Knight may show up, unidentified. Indeed, some knights have taken advantage of the armor to maintain a Secret Identity as a menial servant — often three tournaments before he's unmasked.

It can be distinguished from the Gladiator Games in that tourney are fought in by men of Royal Blood, or Blue Blood. Without being knighted, a character can't compete. (At least, if he tells the truth.) It's very common for it to be part of the celebration after a knighting — after all the new knight must show what he's made of. It's also very common for a knight to carry The Lady's Favor for it.

Compare and contrast the modern trope of the Tournament Arc, which can overlap with The Tourney if the entrants are sufficiently high-profile in the setting and there's enough pageantry, intrigue, and stakes around the events.

-   In _Aruosumente_, there's a tournament held during an important public holiday where the White Knights and the Black Knights compete against each other, although it is more of a background event and an excuse for Lante to drag Legna with him.
-   _Berserk_: In volume 9, when the story shifts back to Guts in order to show what he's been doing during his yearlong absence from the Band of the Hawk, the scene opens on a lavish tournament that includes jousts, foot combat, archery, and tests of strength. The sponsor is an unnamed noble who loves to watch such a spectacle and boasts that the fame of his tournament over the years has drawn strong fighters from different countries. Guts makes a splash by entering the ring and defeating the Bakiraka prince Silat, who up to then had been wiping the floor with the competition. The impressed noble offers Guts a lot of money to work for him in a bandit-hunting expedition, which Guts at first refuses...until the noble mentions that this group of bandits has a female leader, and Guts finds out that the Band of the Hawk has fallen in deep trouble while he was gone.

    Literature 

-   In James Thurber's _The 13 Clocks_, the traveler recognizes the minstrel from him competing in tourneys — being Prince Zorn in disguise.

It's not really central to the plot, apart from showcasing the dynamics between the characters: the king is privately cursed for organizing a tourney when the kingdom is near bankruptcy, Social Climbers figure out which family members can be sent to possibly catch a well-connected noble's attention, queen Jeanne of France (an Alpha Bitch if there ever was one) has to be stopped from recommending (prevent from participating and singling out for ridicule) Villain Protagonist Robert d'Artois. Robert is noted to be quite a good jouster due to his size and weight, though he can't really enjoy himself due to how badly his plans are going and has to flee the country when the last one fails.

-   In the _Belgariad_ and _Malloreon_, the Arendish people, who basically embody a parody of Chivalric Romance, have tourneys regularly for various reasons, including the purposes of Trial by Combat. A few other races have tourneys as well, usually to settle arguments over which warrior is the best with the minimum of bloodshed.
-   In Geoffrey Chaucer's _The Canterbury Tales_, the Knight's tale has one central to the plot.

    -   The tourney in honor of Eddard Stark becoming the Hand of King is a major plot point in the first book.
    -   There are several famous tourneys referred to in the Backstory, as well. Most notably, at the Tourney of Harrenhal, the married Prince Rhaegar won and crowned the betrothed Lyanna Stark as Queen of Love and Beauty, an event which caused a lot of outrage and hinted at the affair between them which would ultimately lead to a civil war.
    -   After crowning himself king, Renly Baratheon holds frequent tourneys, something that strikes Catelyn Stark as frivolous considering that there is the Serious Business of a civil war to be settled.
    -   _Tales of Dunk and Egg_: "The Hedge Knight" has the two characters meet up on the way to a tourney.

From main-series history we know that he will go on to become Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Galavant_: Galavant enters a jousting tourney because the group is out of money, only to be woefully underprepared because he's become an alcoholic, lazy Heartbroken Badass since his girlfriend left him. His reputation gets him moved to the championship bracket, giving Isabella a day to whip him back into athletic shape. She tricks his opponent, Jean Hamm, into getting wasted on absinthe for good measure. Galavant is too sore to move much during the actual joust, leading to the most anticlimactic match ever as both get knocked off their snail's-pace horses. The confused referee deems whoever stands up first to be the winner, which Galavant luckily is.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   The most notable one was the Tourney of the Hand in Season 1, but we also see tourneys hosted by King Joffrey Baratheon and King Renly Baratheon in Season 2.
    -   A tourney is held in the pilot episode of _House of the Dragon_ to celebrate the birth of the son of King Viserys I Targaryen, and Daemon Targaryen is the most notable and showy contestant. Alas, the son dies that very day along with his mother so it was All for Nothing (several knights _died_ in that tourney that quickly turned ruleless Blood Sport, besides).
-   Practically a Once a Season thing on _Merlin_.

    Roleplay 

-   _A Dragon of the North_ features numerous tournaments. Jon Snow not only competes in the first he attends but wins.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Some _Dragon Magazine_ articles provided information on tournaments, such as "The Fairest of the Fairs" in _Dragon_ #137 and "Campaign Components: Knights" in _Dragon_ #299.
    -   The occasional rulebook or supplement (such as the _Complete Fighter's Handbook_ for AD&D's second edition) would also provide special-case rules on how to resolve tournaments and jousts in particular.
-   These occurred on a regular basis in Chaosium's _Pendragon_ game, which makes sense because it's based on the stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.

    Theatre 

-   Dinner Theatre: _Medieval Times_ Dinner and Tournament starts as a friendly contest of skill and jousting prowess between the kingdom's best six knights, but quickly escalates into a tournament filled with battles to the death to determine the kingdom's champion once the story hits full stride.

    Video Games 

-   Parodied in _Blazing Dragons_. An upcoming tournament is offering the hand of the lovely Princess Flame in marriage, but its events consist of log-rolling (which protagonist Flicker handily wins thanks to wearing roller skates) followed by thumb wrestling.
-   You can host these in _Crusader Kings_, which can met you a fair sum of prestige and, for more unscrupulous characters, covertly remove enemies. The _Tours and Tournaments_ DLC for _Crusader Kings III_ goes even further and adds dedicated mechanics for hosting tournaments, including deciding what kind of events will be hosted.
-   In _Defender of the Crown_, you can hold jousting tournaments against the other lords, with a chance to win part of their territory without going to war over it. Even if your opponent doesn't have any land for you to take, you can still gain leadership and fame if you win, which will make it easier for you to complete most of the other events in the game.
-   The Barons of the March in _King of the Castle_ love a good jousting tournament and hold them regularly. Several story events involve the King being invited to such contests, and they can either sponsor one of the knights in the tournament or declare their intent to compete themselves; if the King competes openly, their opponents will deliberately lose out of fear of retaliation for injuring the ruler, but if they don a Secret Identity, they will actually get a proper fight out of their opponents.
-   _Mount & Blade_: Set in fictional not-Europe of 1257. Features tournaments that occasionally crop up in major cities. Anyone can enter the games and bet, and winning a tournament grants renown and the favor of court ladies. In a tournament, contestants are given identical gear which varies on the faction hosting the tournament; the knightly Swadians naturally feature horseback jousting, while the Mongol Empire-esque Khergit Khanate features Horse Archer combat.

    Webcomics 

-   Several in _Arthur, King of Time and Space_, taken from the legends. Most prominently the Tournement at Serleuse, which Guenevere and Lancelot attend during the False Guenevere story.

    Real Life 

-   William Marshal became known as "the greatest knight who ever lived" and started his career as a Tourney fighter when his father send him away to France to get rid of him. He became so successful and famous, that he was chosen by King Henry II of England to be the personal trainer of his son and to take him into his tournament team. He came to serve the royal household under four kings and for some time even was the regent of the kingdom.
-   The Italian Wars featured several challenges where Spanish and Italian soldiers faced French knights in melee battles. Ettore Fieramosca, Diego García de Paredes and Pierre Terrail were their most famous participants.
-   Queen Elizabeth I's Accession Day (the anniversary of the day she became queen) was annually celebrated with a tourney, which was more than half pageantry. Every knight would choose his alias, his pageant car, the proper attendants, and a motto to flatter the queen, make a grand speech in her honor, — and, oh yes, actually riding in tilts against another knight.
-   Henry II of France was accidentally killed in a tourney. The man who accidentally killed him, Gabriel de Lorges, Count of Montgomery, had to go to Normandy, where he lived, even though Henry II himself absolved him on his death bed.
-   Aside from the European version, stylized martial games can be found in many cultures to this day and were the origin of many major sports like Polo. There are even updated tourneys that include contests with modern weapon platforms like the Tiger Meet fighter competition regularly held in Belgium.
-   Henry IV of England had a pretty illustrious reputation as a jouster and was probably the best in England when he was a young man. His chance to prove it against his only real rival in a Duel to the Death was cut short by Richard The Second exiling them.
