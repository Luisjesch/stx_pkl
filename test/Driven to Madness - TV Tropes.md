_"Madness is the emergency exit. You can just step outside, and close the door on all those dreadful things that happened. You can lock them away forever."_

A sister trope to Go Mad from the Revelation, Driven to Madness represents a deliberate attack upon a character's sanity and mental stability.

There are many varied reasons for someone to attempt to drive another person to madness. Perhaps they seek to break the character's will in order to make them more pliable, or it may be an attempt to induce a Freak Out or Face–Heel Turn. They may wish to punish the character or torment them by attacking their loved ones in such a fashion. They may try doing so in order to have someone discredited or declared incompetent. Maybe they're just jerks.

Somewhat less evilly, someone may regard sanity as a prison and seek to release a character from its constraints by any means necessary.

The methods can vary, as well, from making them doubt their perceptions, to the aforementioned torture, exposure to a Brown Note, or even straight-up Mind Rape. Some Eldritch Abominations drive men mad with their mere presence. Sometimes it can come just from going really really fast.

Particularly effective if the character has reason to doubt their own sanity, such as if they have recently been discharged from a mental institution or have undergone a nervous breakdown. Indeed, in such a situation, this often takes the form of a Through the Eyes of Madness plot - at least at first.

May be an aspect of the Mind Game Ship if the reasons for the sanity breaking are part of the appeal.

Can overlap with Break the Cutie.

The subtrope, Gaslighting, is the subtle, insidious form of this. For unintended descents into madness, see Sanity Slippage.

    Films — Animated 

-   _The Twelve Tasks of Asterix_:
    -   The titular hero and his friend are sent to "The Place That Sends You Mad", a building from which they are to receive a certain form - alas, within the building lies a _ferociously_ obstructive bureaucracy. So obstructive, in fact, that it briefly pushes Obelix over the edge. Fortunately, Asterix manages to turn the situation around, driving the bureaucrats mad instead - and allowing him to get the form in the process.
    -   Earlier in the film, Asterix also manages to cause a hypnotist to turn his power back onto himself, causing the poor man to believe himself a wild boar. Iris may be a poor man, but it's a funny moment.
        
        **Iris**: _(eyes glowing)_ By Osiris and by Apis, _look at me_...  
        **Asterix**: Can you light those up one at a time?

        **Asterix**: Can you use them for reading in bed?

In the _Haunter of the Dark_ he seeks to kill his summoner, because he didn't provide an appropriate sacrifice, in _The Dreams in the Witch-House_ he just played a role as a guardian to the secrets beyond human ken who receives sacrificial tribute in return of allowing individuals to cross that veil, and in the _Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath_ he is seeking retribution against Randolph Carter for trying to see Earth's god's he had sworn to protect (and dominate) for unknown purposes, and is content to have a nice chat over a cup of tea.

Her family kept what happened to her a secret so the Ministry wouldn't institutionalize her because she posed a risk to the International Statue of Secrecy as she couldn't control her magic anymore.
-   Norwegian author _Ingeborg Refling Hagen_ had this as a common trait in her early production. Most of her main characters were either Driven To Madness, Driven to Suicide _or both_!
-   In _Emperors of Illusions_, this is the goal of the protagonists, as far as The Emperor is concerned. They have nothing against him personally (except for Kay, whose home planet was destroyed at the Emperor's order), but a Corrupt Corporate Executive thinks that the Emperor created this universe and wishes to pay him back for that by destroying humankind, so they decide to get rid of the Emperor. However, since Resurrective Immortality exists in this universe, the Emperor cannot be killed permanently. Their plan is to cause him to lose his mind in a way that is irreversible. It nearly works, but the final trigger phrase fails because the Emperor is not the creator of the world, resulting in an Empire-wide manhunt for the conspirators.
-   In a somewhat unknown Swedish novel, _Simons Family_ by Marianne Freddriksson, the Jewish character Isak is training at a boot camp. His squadron leader tries to break the spirit of him by being his antisemitic self. Isak begins to go numb almost to the point of no return.

The Master's last words before one apparent Final Death (it didn't stick) to the Doctor was him asking whether the drumming would finally end.
    -   In the Series 9 finale three-parter, the Twelfth Doctor is driven to madness by a Trauma Conga Line: betrayal and capture by both Ashildr and the Time Lords, his companion Clara being Killed Off for Real, and Cold-Blooded Torture at the hands of the latter betrayer, with absolutely no one around to help him through his agony. The result is that he becomes a Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds who almost destroys _Time itself_ in the pursuit of a Tragic Dream.

Stopped from wrecking the _Enterprise_ in an attempt to destroy the Planet Killer, Decker decides that his death is the only way he can atone for killing his crew, and rams a shuttlecraft down the Planet Killer's maw.
        -   Then in "The Omega Glory" Captain Tracey goes insane after losing his entire crew to the Omega IV virus, making him another Sole Survivor. Matters are not helped by Tracey thinking he's found a fountain of youth on the planet and using his technology to aide the Kohm in their war against the Yangs.
    -   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ has this happen to Gul Dukat after he witnesses the death of his daughter, at the climax of a long string of personal and career setbacks.

Dukat eventually comes out of his Villainous BSoD, but becomes steadily more unhinged and even more dangerous for it, even before he becomes the Bajoran religious equivalent of a Dark Messiah.

He's given the broad authority to fire any faculty who he believes is unfit for the teaching profession. The psychologist is already overworked, and is provably unfit to make recommendations (he suggests, for example, Mr. Boynton should be an exterminator). Miss Brooks, Mr. Boynton, Walter Denton, and eventually Mr. Conklin himself gaslight the psychologist until he withdraws his recommendations and takes his much needed rest.

    Tabletop Games

If they reach the breaking point twice, they'll havea heart attack and be immediately dropped to Death's Door, or if they already were, they'll die instantly with No Saving Throw. Good news is, there is a tiny chance that the heroes can find clarity in the eye of the storm, effectively making them even better than normal, but even that can be stripped away with enough stress.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series, finding inventive ways to drive people to complete madness is within the realm of Sheogorath, the Daedric Prince of Madness. He even considers it _a blessing_:

-   _American Dad!_: Stan Smith is such an idiot that he repeatedly forgets his anniversary, despite how terrifying his wife Francine gets when he does.

Again, Stan is such an idiot that he keeps forgetting the reason Francine was locked up, and by the day she's released, he has nothing prepared. When Stan greets Francine with a bucket of fried chicken and offers an incredibly half-assed explanation of how he did everything "for love", Francine not only states she genuinely hates Stan, but she goes insane for real and gets committed indefinitely.
