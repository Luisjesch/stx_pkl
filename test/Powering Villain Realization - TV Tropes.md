_"Get off my ship. You're a dead duck here. You're powerless. We know about you, and we don't want to play. Maybe there are others like you around. Maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of history, but that's all over. We'll be on guard now, ready for you, so ship out! Come on! Haul it!"_

Not every villain has power of their own. Some are Emotion Eaters or run on the power of imagination. They may also cause, or take advantage of, a Hate Plague. As such, they tend to draw their strength from their victims.

However, this has a tendency to backfire on such villains, as once the hero or heroine realizes this, they are able to stem the flow of power, and take control of the situation.

This is a common way of defeating an Enemy Without. Could lead to Heroic Suicide if the character has to die to cut off the villain's power.

May overlap with Sheathe Your Sword, when the way to defeat an enemy is to stop fighting them altogether.

    Literature 

-   _Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest_: The final challenge of the Frost Caverns in volumes 8 and 9 is for the dungeon-delvers to battle Doppelgangers of themselves, which are meant to mirror their character flaws to them and encourage them to overcome them—lest the god Ehit use those flaws against them. The duplicates are powered up by the flaws and weakened by overcoming them. Most of the characters figure this out and find ways to address the flaws, breaking the duplicates' power. However, Hajime instead uses the duplicate to spot small flaws and inefficiencies in _his fighting style_ and thereby destroys it by simply becoming a better fighter on the fly (justified by the fact the duplicate was based on a magical scan from when he entered the dungeon and has Creative Sterility), while Kouki fails utterly to overcome his Fatal Flaw, gets possessed by the duplicate and turned Ax-Crazy, and has to be beaten into submission by Hajime.
-   _Harry Potter_: In the last book of the series Harry discovers he is one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. When Voldemort tried to kill him as a baby, a piece of Voldemort's own soul was bound to Harry.

Fortunately, the circumstances of Voldemort's resurrection allowed Harry to survive his Heroic Sacrifice while the piece of Voldemort's soul inside him was destroyed.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Star Trek_:
    -   _Star Trek: The Original Series_:
        -   In "The Cage", Pike realizes that the Talosians cannot read strong, violent thoughts, and also that they rely on him to supply the imaginations they use to fuel the illusions they attempt to trap him in, so he sits in his cell, stewing in hatred and anger until the Keeper gets careless and Pike seizes him.
        -   In "And the Children Shall Lead", the evil entity called Gorgan gets its power from the fact that the children believe it has power. When that belief is taken away, Gorgan dies rather messily.
        -   In "Day of the Dove", an entity that feeds on hate and violence invades the _Enterprise_, setting Kirk and Klingon Captain Kang and their crews against each other.

    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: In "Gambit", Picard realizes that an ancient Vulcan weapon that a terrorist group has been trying to reconstruct was discarded by the ancient Vulcans because the weapon relied on the aggressive emotions of the victim to power it, and the Vulcans had no use for it when they embraced a path of total logic. He orders his security team to empty their minds of any aggressive thoughts, including Lt. Worf, who manages to do so, rendering the weapon utterly harmless against them.

    Video Games 

-   At the end of _Planescape: Torment_, the Nameless One meets the Transcendent One — a godlike being that has been haunting him for the entire game, because TTO is actually TNO's own mortality, stripped from him by Ravel millennia ago and left alone to grow more intelligent and powerful ever since. In a twist, while The Nameless One's existence is necessary for The Transcendent One's, his repeated deaths are actually _not_ making it stronger — on the contrary, their separation are a detriment to both as The Nameless One's mind grows weaker with every death and The Transcendent One's body frays a little bit more. Realising this provides you with an argument if you want to reunite The Nameless One with his mortality.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_: During Noah and Co's fight with Consul K, after they've managed to deplete his health, he impowers himself with the life force of the nearby Colony Four fighters, as well as stealing from their Flame Clock.

-   _The Real Ghostbusters_: In both encounters with the Boogeyman, the demon's nature of feeding on the fear of his victims is turned against him. In his first episode, the Carter kids decide that they aren't going to be afraid of him anymore, casting out such insults as his head is too big and he looks stupid. This allows the Ghostbusters to get past him and temporarily seal him in his own dimension. In his second appearance, a near-fatal fall off of the World Trade Center has Egon in a state of primal fear, though he refuses to admit it. This allows the Boogeyman to free himself from his dimension, as Egon was one of the Boogeyman's former victims. But when the Boogeyman decides to go after the Junior Ghostbusters, Egon goes into Papa Wolf mode, his anger and outrage overpowering his fear. He is thus able to free himself and his fellow Ghostbusters from the restraints that the Boogeyman had put them in, and whip up a plan to convert the Boogeyman from demon to ghost so that they could trap him in the Containment Unit once and for all.
-   _Samurai Jack_:

    -   In Season 5, Mad Jack returns, angrily demanding a monk return his sword to him. Jack recognizes that Mad Jack is the worst part of himself and utterly renounces him. This causes the gods to deem that Jack is once again worthy and restore him to his proper form, along with his sword.
-   _The Simpsons_: In the "Treehouse of Horror VI" segment "Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores", giant advertising mascots run amok in Springfield.

Sylvia sees this and realizes what Wander is doing, and convinces the Baaaaa-hallans to also ignore the troll until it shrinks down to a few inches small.
