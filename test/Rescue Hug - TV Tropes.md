An obvious yet effective way to put a stealth hug between two characters, especially in No Hugging, No Kissing worlds.

One of the characters, usually the female, trips over something or feels faint. Or maybe is jumping from a high place. Then, the other character, usually the male, catches him/her just in time to prevent him/her to hit the ground.

However, both characters don't move away from each other right away. They take their time. Maybe to comfort each other (which may evolve to Cry into Chest). Or maybe they are too busy looking into each other's eyes. Some extreme cases can even involve an Accidental Kiss, and some more moderate ones can lead to an Almost Kiss.

Compare to Accidental Hug and The Glomp. May overlap with Falling into His Arms.

-   In _Fruits Basket_, Tohru trips and falls down a slope, prompting both Yuki and Kyo to try to rescue her, accidentally hug her, and turn into animals.
-   In a _Maison Ikkoku_ comic book, Kyoko is trying to fix the porch globe light when Yusaku arrives, startling her. Kyoko falls off the ladder and not only do they end up hugging as he catches her, but their lips touch as well. Since no one else saw it happen, and they're both supposed to be dating other people, they decide to pretend all that happened was that Kyoko slipped and dropped the globe.
-   In _PandoraHearts_ Gil frequently does this to Oz.
-   _Pokémon: The Original Series_: In "The Heartbreak of Brock", Brock grabs the Girl of the Week when she trips and falls, leading to a Rescue Romance that's one-sided on her part. Turns out, she does that every man she meets and ironically, this happens to be the one time where Brock doesn't want have a relationship with (at first).
-   _Tactics_: Haruka once does this to Kantarou.

    Film — Animated 

-   In _Aladdin_, when the titular character leads Jasmine to his hideaway, the girl trips and falls into Aladdin's arms. Needless to say, they don't break the embrace right away.
-   Casting agent Farley Wink nearly throws his secretary Sawyer into Danny's arms in Turner Features Animation's _Cats Don't Dance_. "He's new in town. Be nice." It doesn't help that Sawyer encountered Danny previously and regards him as a frenetic lunatic.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Star Wars_: Episode V _The Empire Strikes Back_: While the _Millennium Falcon_ is inside the asteroid, there's a sudden tremor. Princess Leia falls backward and Han Solo catches her. He doesn't let go immediately and continues to hold her even after she gets uncomfortable and asks him to let go. They then have a bit of banter that's intended to foreshadow their growing attraction to each other.
    
    **Han:** Don't get excited!
    
    **Leia:** Captain, being held by you isn't _quite_ enough to get me excited.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   Used more than once as an explanation by Rene in _'Allo 'Allo!_ to his wife as to why she had just caught him and one of his mistresses wrapped around each other.
    
    "You stew-pid woman, can you not see the poor girl has just tripped and I was 'elping steady her."
    
-   _Jane the Virgin_: In Season 1, after Petra is held captive in the Everglades by Roman Zazo, who had faked his own death and posed as his twin brother, she manages to call Michael, whom she had told of her suspicions, and give her location. She manages to run from Roman who catches up with her and she accidentally kills him in self-defence. When Michael finds her she is distraught and traumatised and hugs him. He comforts her.
-   In heavy overlap with Falling into His Arms, _Once Upon a Time_'s Rumplestiltskin catches and saves Belle when she falls off a ladder—and the two immediately spend way too long staring at each other in amazement.

    Video Games 

-   In _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_, when Zelda wakes up from her thousand years of slumber, she falls down but Link catches her just in time in what looks like a tender hug.
