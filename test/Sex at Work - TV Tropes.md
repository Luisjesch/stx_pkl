Mmmm... _files_.

**Dwight:** Michael, confession. I have done PDA in the office.  
**Michael:** Thank you.  
**Dwight:** I've had _intercourse_ in the office.  
**Michael:** Alright!  
**Dwight:** As has Angela.  
**Angela:** _Dwight!_  
**Dwight:** As has Ryan, as has Kelly, as has Meredith, as has Phyllis, as has Darryl, as has Creed, as has Michael, and as has Holly!

There's nothing quite like paperclips and staplers to get the mood going.

Work Sex is a subtrope of Making Love in All the Wrong Places, when two characters decide that their site of employment (of all places) is where they want to do it. It may _seem_ unprofessional, unhygienic and most of all uncomfortable, but there's no arguing with why characters enjoy it.

The trope can intersect with Professionals Do It on Desks, however Work Sex refers to any place in a working environment where characters have intercourse. The environments that the trope takes place in are usually storage rooms, private offices or bathrooms. Sometimes the characters are successful, other times they're interrupted, and they don't always get caught either. The trope is not applicable in workplaces that actually have beds, i.e. on-call rooms in hospitals. Nor does it apply to pornography sets, hotel rooms, or professions that require they go to someone's residence (i.e. Pizza Boy Special Delivery).

Compare with Business Trip Adultery, Desk Sweep of Passion, Office Romance, Sleeping with the Boss. Not to be confused with sex workers.

This is Truth in Television, so No Real Life Examples, Please!

    Comic Books 

-   _The Internship_:
    -   This is one of the main narrative devices of the comic's story, regarding the titular "internship". The comic's main protagonist, Andy, enters onto an ongoing sexual relationship with his older boss Emery. It's partially what pushes Andy to start facing his own accumulated baggage in life, including the nature of his relationship with Cooper, the comic's Deuteragonist.
    -   River gives this in Volume 3 to a friend of theirs, Doug, who works as a cashier in a clothing store. In exchange for allowing them and Cooper to walk out of the store with costumes and equipment for a stage performance, River gives Doug a blowjob in a dressing room. The dialogue between the two of them implies that this isn't the _first_ time that River has done this. Coop actually catches a glimpse of the two, River looking back while Doug's distracted and even winking at him. While the scene is sexy, River's _technically_ committing a crime by doing this.
    -   In Volume 4, Cooper gets in on it this too, with River. The day after the blowjob scene mentioned above, River and Cooper have a "dress rehearsal" in Fletcher's private filming spot. Which involves the two of them spending a _lot_ of time rubbing up against each other naked. River actually apologizes for how Coop's being understandably "blue-balled". Then, after they're done and the two sit down to rest, Coop finally gives in and gives River's neck a lick. After Coop apologizes for it, River decides to reciprocate and gives Coop a handjob to help him relieve himself. After Coop is...relieved, River decides not to do the same for themselves, but doesn't say why, just saying that Coop gave them a good time and returning a surprise hug from him before he leaves.
