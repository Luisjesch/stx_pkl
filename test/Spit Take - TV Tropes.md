Barging into a subject like that while he's drinking? Really, Zii should know better.

_\[spits out water\] "**Why is it that I'm always drinking when a scene like that happens?!**"_

A variant of The Take to an unexpected event that involves spraying food or, more commonly, drink from a character's mouth. In some cases, the character sprays their drink out of their nose instead of their mouth. It can be Truth in Television, as many people can attest, though in real life, unexpected laughter is more likely than shock to induce such a reaction. The non-eating version is generally a "pfft".

Why surprising news or the punchline of a joke is so often delivered when a character has a full mouth can only be ascribed to Rule of Funny. May also be part of an I Ate WHAT?! reaction to the efforts of a Lethal Chef or Cordon Bleugh Chef.

A common Lampshade Hanging for this trope is when a character pauses to take a drink just so he has something to spit out in reaction.

See also: Double Take, Dramatic Drop, Discreet Drink Disposal, and Stopped Dead in Their Tracks. Not to be confused with Spit Shake. Compare Spraying Drink from Nose, which is usually caused by laughter instead of surprise. Unrelated to Spit Shine.

It turns out that the soda isn't exactly making things happen; rather, it predicts the future and gives you an urge to drink it when something surprising is about to happen.

    **Dom:** The Rod of _Zuriel_? They're giving _that_ hunk of self-important rock to the winner? Why not simply kill them and enslave their will in the spectral plane right off? It would certainly involve less oration.

-   Parodied by Eda in _The Silver Raven_.

    "I can't let you retire," the Sandaime held up a hand, forestalling Kakashi's protest, "but I can take you off active duty and make you part of the reserves. You'll be expected to keep up with your training, and in the event of a serious threat to the village, you will be reactivated. Otherwise, for all intents and purposes, you will be a civilian unless you choose to return to active duty."  
    Kakashi bowed deeply, relief loosening the tightness in his chest.  
    "Thank you, Hokage-sama."  
    The Sandaime picked up his pipe and sucked in a deep lungful of tobacco.  
    "So do you have a plan for what you're going to do next?" he asked after blowing out a cloud of blue smoke.  
    Kakashi smiled, the most honest, relaxed expression he’d managed since Rin’s death, and waited for the Sandaime to take another pull on his pipe before answering.  
    "Well, a friend of mine keeps suggesting I open a bakery, so I thought I'd do that."  
    There was something vaguely satisfying about watching the God of Shinobi nearly choke to death on his own pipe.

    Films — Live-Action

    **Austin:** Cor! This coffee smells like shit.  
    _\[Basil looks at the "pot" Austin got it from, noticing it is labeled **Fat Bastard Stool Sample**\]_  
    **Basil:** It _is_ shit, Austin.  
    **Austin:** Oh, good then it's not just me. _\[takes a drink, then smacks his lips\]_ It's a bit nutty.

He finds his way to the kitchen... only to find out there's another sandwich/milk combo in there, and they are disgustingly spoiled. Guess which one he gets his hands on...

The "outtake" might not have been an actual outtake, but might have actually been used, with the cut occurring just before Fox went off character.

    **Jessie:**' It'll also make your testicles fall off.  
    **Charlie:** _\[vigorous spit-take\]_

    -   When he was named to switch brands in the WWE's 2004 draft, he immediately spit out the water he was drinking.
    -   When DX were questioned over running down "Stone Cold" Steve Austin Road Dogg gave his real name as Dees Nuts, causing Trips to spray out his water as he laughed.

-   Then there was "One Night Stand 2005", where Paul Heyman namedrops Matt Hardy in front of Edge — who had recently yoinked Matt's girlfriend Lita (in real life, not kayfabe) — and Edge spits out the beer he's drinking.

    Theatre 

-   The Play Within a Play in _The Drowsy Chaperone_ has one scene that consists of nothing _but_ Spit Takes. This is because, according to the Man in the Chair, plays and musicals would have smaller, often meaningless scenes that could allow the crew to ready the stage for the next musical number. His reasoning is that in musicals - like in pornography - the plot takes a backseat to the "production numbers", and so an utterly meaningless scene consisting of only spit takes is placed to bridge two musical numbers.
    -   Later, in the number _Love is Always Lovely (In the End)_, Underling (who was the recipient of the spit-takes of the above scene) got to give one to Tottendale (who was doing the spitting) when she confesses her love for him. The Man in the Chair notes that the song's title always reminded him of anal sex (love in the end - as in rear end, get it?), leading the audience to wonder why he associates sex and spitting.
-   The Reduced Shakespeare Company covers _Hamlet_ in their performance, where Ophelia's death scene is some screaming followed by a spit-take in reverse. As a result, when they do the whole play backwards at the end, the spit-take is executed normally - and to hilarious effect.

-   _Sam & Max: Freelance Police_: Episode 204: Chariots of the Dogs _actually requires Sam and Max to get another character to perform a spit-take, so they can use the DNA from his spit._ To be fair, that particular character's spit turns out to be a red herring. The spit Sam and Max _really_ need is taken from an envelope.
    -   Sam later mentions that he _wants_ to do one when he learns that Brady Culture likes being in Hell, but his mouth is too parched, so he settles on a Big "WHAT?!".
-   Used to _hilarious_ effect in _Persona 4_, to illustrate just how mind-bendingly awful a particular batch of curry is, when immediately followed by keeling over _sideways_ onto a picnic bench. Zero to horizontal in .1 seconds.

-   Elcia from _Area X_ does this in the Middle Ages when Pedoe tells her he wants her to be his 44th wife.
-   Gian from _Lucky Dog 1_ does this multiple times when he meets Rosalia in Ivan's route. First when she reveals she's a high ranking mafia member's granddaughter, second when she says Ivan is invited to lunch with the mafia member and third when she reveals she's Ivan's fiancée.
-   Hisao in _Katawa Shoujo_ gets a few: once when Kenji describes books as "the medium our ancestors used to view porn" (ruining a library book in the process, to his horror), and another when Lilly's sister Akira casually reminds Lilly to use contraceptives... right in front of Hisao.
-   Godot does this often in _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_ whenever Phoenix discredits one of his witnesses' testimony. Parodied in some cases where Godot will actually go through the motions of receiving his coffee, sniffing it, guzzling it down, and _then_ spitting it out. In one instance Godot took _two_ drinks. It's usually "symbolic" to the progress you've made, too, since Godot will only ever have 17 cups of coffee in one case, meaning if he's just spitting out coffee, he's coming to an end. Or if he's chugging them down, he's coming to an end for his benefit. To emphasize the whole parody he does in the game, it should be pointed out that he was Going Through the Motions in the _very first_ instance of this trope in the game ever. Even further lampshaded by Maya at one point.
    
    **Godot:** I've been made to eat my words once again!  
    **Maya:** Actually you've been made to do a spit-take... with a cup of coffee.
    
    -   In case 4 _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice_, when Uendo is drinking tea while he's on the witness stand, he does one of these when Athena says something he finds surprising.

-   It's a Running Gag at Fark that posting something sufficiently funny will induce this reaction in whoever sees it, resulting in a drink spit all over the keyboard, ruining it.
