_"We're a lot alike, you and I. You tested me. I tested you. You killed me. I — oh, no, wait. I guess I haven't killed you yet. Well. Food for thought."_

This trope is Exactly What It Says on the Tin: A character threatens to kill another, but without actually using the words "I'll kill you." Usually involves the use of an analogy, a hypothetical question or another subtle remark that comes off as a threat in context.

This often allows the maker of the threat to avoid being punished for making threats, since they can claim they never _really_ threatened the target, and is often employed when neither side is allowed to take action against each other. Often the person making the threat will avoid naming the threatened person directly. _Very_ often leads to Is That a Threat?. On occasion, this will fly over the head of the person being threatened, particularly if that person is rather dense or the threat is especially oblique.

If the threat is made against the other person's family or against their property, that's Shame If Something Happened. The clearest nonverbal versions are the Dramatic Gun Cock and the Throat-Slitting Gesture. When you apply this trope to the death of a third party, it's Deadly Euphemism. Through some Teeth-Clenched Teamwork, this can also lead to You Have Outlived Your Usefulness, if the character is working for or with the other character that they have just threatened. See also Scarily Specific Story, which could overlap if the threatener makes the threat into a story.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Gunslinger Girl_: Henrietta recreates the death of a cyborg girl who shot her own handler and then killed herself after she realised that her handler did not return her feelings. Alarmed, her handler Jose knocks the pistol out of her hand; it turns out to be unloaded. After all, says Henrietta, how could she possibly kill herself "as long as you're this wonderful, Jose."
-   During the latter's introductory chapter in _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_, Kaguya cheerfully holds a rubber knife to Ishigami's chest, telling him that if he ever reveals what he discovered about one of her plans, the knife won't be a toy next time. Made even more effective by the fact that she and the knife were both covered in stage blood (she was wearing a costume for the drama club).
-   _Naruto_: During the Chunin Exams finals, Neji tells the referee that the fight has dragged on too long and, if Naruto refuses to give up, Neji won't take any responsibility for what happens to him. Given that during the preliminaries he tried to attack Hinata with the intent to kill her (having to be stopped by _four_ jounin at the same time) because she turned back his You Can't Fight Fate Breaking Speech against him, and Naruto was doing it too, it's very much clear that he too was going for deadly force for the same reason.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   At the very start of the series, some mountain bandits are prepared to kill Luffy, when Shanks shows up to help him. When one of the bandits points a gun to Shanks' head, Shanks calmly asks if the man is prepared to risk his life by doing so, but the bandit isn't at all intimidated by the threat. Seconds later, Shanks' subordinate Lucky Roux shoots the bandit in the head at point-blank range.
    -   Shortly after entering the Grand Line, the Straw Hats respond to Crocus' intimidating Death Glare by threatening to shoot him with their cannon. He replies that if they do that, someone is going to die. That someone being him.
-   After breaking Speed-O-Sound Sonic's sword by biting right through it, Saitama of _One-Punch Man_ warns him (with a serious Death Glare) that he is busy and in a bad mood, and that anyone who gets in his way is going to get punched. This is coming from the guy who can kill just about anything with one punch, and it's enough to elicit an Oh, Crap! from Sonic, who already received one (accidental) Groin Attack from him.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, after Pegasus separates Mokuba's soul from his body, he tells Seto Kaiba that he will release him on the condition that he beats both Yugi and himself in a duel. Kaiba agrees, before delivering one to him in turn.
    
    **Kaiba**: For now, I have no choice but to play your game, but soon, as soon as I defeat Yugi, I'll be back, and you better make good on your promise to restore my brother, because if you don't, I'll take great pleasure in separating _your_ soul from your body in my own way!

-   _Firefly: The Sting_: At one point Saffron is pushing Zoe's buttons about motherhood and Zoe reminds her that she can kill her with her bare hands.
-   A _G.I. Joe Origins_ short story (published by Devil's Due) showcased how "Duke" Hauser had been hired by the titular covert-ops team: during his debriefing with General "Hawk" regarding an ambush that he had single-handedly saved his comrades from, Hawk says that it was pretty brave and Medal of Honor material... too bad that it's posthumous because he was killed in action. During the debriefing he had been doing some Gun Stripping of a pistol, and by the time he explained the offer to enter G.I. Joe and mentioned the "killed in action" part, Hawk had the gun assembled, loaded and pointed towards Hauser.
-   In _The Smurfs_ comic book story "The Reporter Smurf", Reporter gets Brainy to leave the newspaper's printing office and not suggest anymore changes to the paper by underhandedly threatening him with an "accident" while Greedy crushes a nut under the printing press to drive home the point.
-   _The Transformers: Windblade_:
    -   Starscream has the following reasoning for saving Windblade's life:
        
        **Starscream:** When you die, it will be in public, with witnesses, and I'll be at least five miles away.
        
    -   Windblade later retorts after saving Starscream with:
        
        **Windblade:** When you die, it'll be for something you deserve and all of Cybertron will know it.

    -   In another strip, Hobbes offers this gem in response to Calvin once again trying to nail him with a water balloon:
        
        **Hobbes:** Here's a hypothetical question you should ask yourself. If you knew today was your last day on earth, what would you do different? Especially if, by doing something different, today might NOT be your last day on earth?
        
    -   In another, Calvin's dad, fed up with Calvin using the distinction between his body and spirit to justify his actions, says "The body is the home of the spirit and if you're not in bed in two minutes, your spirit is going to be permanently nomadic".

-   Done non-verbally in _Ratatouille_. One of the many stories Horst tells to explain his stint in prison is that he killed a man with his _thumb_. Later, when he catches the disgraced Skinner spying on Gusteau's, he wordlessly brandishes that same thumb as a threat.

    -   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations_, Viola Cadaverini seems to have almost every other line be this, offering food and drink that is implied to be poisoned, all in a Creepy Monotone. She's a Mafia Princess, so it's not exactly an empty threat.

-   In response to the "Storm Area 51" thing that had gone viral, the United States Air Force officially stated "\[Area 51\] is an open training range for the US Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces." It's pretty much the friendliest way a military force could say "by the by, cross this line and you'll be perforated by 3000 rounds per minute." Of course, when people still seemed _dead_ set on storming the place, they dropped the "implied" part and just said "\[The Air Force\] is ready to protect America and its assets."

That’s why you’re still alive."

Pfefer was a notorious record keeper and kept a note that said "This is where Christine Jarrett threatened to kill me."
-   The memetic phrase "\_\_\_\_\_ wants to know your location," where the blank is a person or an organization, and which is a play on smartphone apps and websites asking the user permission to access their location data (e.g. "Google wants to know your location \[so it can fine-tune your search results\]"). What it means is that the subject wants to find you and _tear you a new one_, in response to something you said that offended them.
    -   Another of a more direct and dubiously-legal form is the response, "That's a very good argument. However \[insert first user's IP/Home address here\]." The meaning of this one is a bit clearer: They've already _found_ you and they're _coming_.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
