_"See what's going on inside my mind."_

Some songs are about being in love. Some songs are about angst. Some songs are about being insane. They may be incoherent, psychedelic messes or intricate folk songs, but they're about going insane. Common themes are what drove the singer crazy and what it feels like in the depths of madness.

The music may rise and fall erratically or use other tricks to indicate the singer's fractured mental state, but just as often the tune sounds perfectly normal.

Note that if the singer is mentally ill but the song is about something else, it doesn't count.

A Sub-Trope of Sanity Slippage.

Compare BSoD Song and Disney Acid Sequence. If the slippage results from being driven mad by envy or sorrow, this could overlap with Revenge Ballad. If it illustrates a Villainous Breakdown, then it doubles as a Villain Song. Might be paired with a Deranged Dance.

-   In _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, "Komm, Süßer Tod" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  manages to perfectly show the final nails being hammered into Shinji's breakdown. As well as Asuka's, Misato's, and everyone else on Earth. Any song where the lyrics are: "...so with sadness in my heart, it seems the best thing I can do is end it all and leave forever. What's done is done it feels so bad, what once was happy now is sad. I'll never love again, my world is ending." Counts merely from the lyrics, and that's before the triple whammy of Lyrical Dissonance, Soundtrack Dissonance and Mood Dissonance.
-   A lot of the character songs from _Higurashi: When They Cry_ deal with this, as to be expected given the nature of the series, but Satoshi Hojo's song _YellowsicKING_ in particular stands out in this regard.
-   The _Umineko: When They Cry_ ending theme, "La Divina Tragedia" is something like this, maybe mixed with an Obsession Song as well.
-   "Duvet" from _Serial Experiments Lain_ is this, especially the last verse.
-   "Velveteen" from _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ seems to be this, though the fact that the lyrics switch languages several times make it hard to be certain.
-   The lyrics to "The World" from _.hack//SIGN_ might qualify given the nature of the series. They start out in 3rd person talking about loneliness and insanity, and end in a 1st person reluctant acceptance.
    
    You are here alone again | In your sweet insanity
    
    All too calm you hide yourself from reality
    
    Do you call it solitude? | Do you call it liberty?
    
    When all the world turns away | Leaves you lonely
    
    —
    
    I am here alone again | In my sweet serenity
    
    Hoping you will ever find me in any place
    
    I will call it solitude | When all my songs fade in vane
    
    Fly away | On my own | To eternity
    

    Fan Works 

-   "The Moon Rises", from Princess Luna's perspective in days of yore. It starts out as a calm nocturne, then her envy and resentment come more to the fore until the last verse is a Motive Rant, as she turns into Nightmare Moon.
    
    _So say goodnight to this,_  
    _The final setting of the sun,_  
    _Tomorrow dawns in darkness;_  
    _The nighttime has begun!_
    
-   There are some fan remakes of Monika's song "My Reality" from _Doki Doki Literature Club!_ which is itself a borderline example since it alludes to her existential suffering and going Yandere from the point of view of other characters undergoing sanity slippage.

    Films — Animation 

-   "Hellfire" in Disney's _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_, which is when even Frollo realizes he's crossing a line. He realizes he's lusting for Esmeralda, and he plays the Never My Fault card and says he's willing to burn down Paris to find Esmeralda. The fact he tries to embrace a ghost of her doesn't help.
-   _The Lorax (2012)_:
    -   "How Bad Can I Be?" in begins with The Once-ler innocently asking how growing his business is a bad thing... and ends with him shouting the lyric with a deranged grin as a challenge as he obliterates the forest.
    -   There's also the Cut Song titled "The Once-ler's Traveling Madness," which is Exactly What It Says on the Tin.
    -   Another cut song, "Biggering" has the Once-ler pondering his simple beginnings and escalates to him responding to the Lorax's final words of warning with a reprise of the lyrics from "How Bad Can I Be", fully acknowledging that he's killing the environment and doesn't care in a frenzied act of spite to try and distance himself.
-   "Paris is a Lonely Town" from _Gay Purr-ee_, as Mewsette contemplates suicide.
-   The "Que sera, Que sera" sequence from _Mary and Max_.
-   Spinel's introduction in _Steven Universe: The Movie_ is a mixture of this and Villain Song. The electric swing is an especially nice touch and really lends it that cartoonish feel, considering many early cartoons employed jazz music in their scores.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Anna and the Apocalypse:_ "Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now" sung by the villain Mr. Savage, he goes crazy prancing around the kitchen. At one point, the song seemingly ends, only for him to abruptly sing again.
-   "Let The Monster Rise," "Legal Assassin," "Night Surgeon," and "Thankless Job" from _Repo! The Genetic Opera_. (So almost everything Nathan Wallace or Repo Man sings.)
-   The famous "Memo From Turner" from _Performance_ is, in context, a Sanity Slippage Song from an Imagine Spot in which Turner finds his persona and identity blurring with Chas's.
-   Bryan Ferry's "Help Me", the song that is playing at the bar in _The Fly (1986)_, was originally commissioned to underscore the film's end credits but contrasted too much with Howard Shore's lush orchestral score to be an effective playout. The lyrics, reflecting the tragic dissolution of the protagonist's body and mind to Body Horror, have the singer pleading for his lover to _hopefully_ lead him back to himself via The Power of Love. For bonus points, Ferry's body language in the music video produced for it suggests he's trapped and writhing in a straitjacket.
    
    I'm a victim of the night  
    Sold my soul, is it ever gonna pay?  
    I beg you now, save me from myself  
    Time is closing in  
    There's no one I can turn to  
    There's a power in love  
    There's a danger in love  
    But I need love to help me find a way.
    
-   _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_;
    -   "Rose Tint My World" is the characters admitting that Frank has broken them and they're now just living for sexual pleasure.
    -   "I'm Going Home", Richard O'Brien says in the commentary that Frank hallucinates the audience that fades in.

    Live-Action TV 

-   With the lead being in the midst of a perpetual nervous breakdown, and a running theme among all the characters being unhealthy coping mechanisms (and unlearning them), it's no shock that _Crazy Ex-Girlfriend_ has many songs that fit this trope. A particularly notable one is "After Everything I've Done For You (That You Didn't Ask For)", an homage to another famous Sanity Slippage Song, "Rose's Turn".
    
    -   "(Tell Me I'm Okay) Patrick" has Rebecca pleading for a bewildered delivery guy to tell her that she is not going crazy.
    
    **Rebecca**: Seriously, Patrick, was I sick the day in school they taught you how to be a normal person? It just feels like there's something fundamental I'm missing out on. Like, is there an instruction manual? You get what I'm saying, Patrick? It just - it just feels like everyone is in this cabal of normal people, and they're all laughing at me, like I'm the jester in my own Truman Show. Patrick, tell me what the secret is. Just tell me what the secret is. Is there a manual? Do you have the manual? I know you have the manual, Patrick. I KNOW IT'S IN YOUR TRUCK, PATRICK!
    
-   Kurt singing "Rose's Turn" on _Glee_ also counts
-   In one episode of _The Muppet Show_ a monster (with windmill legs) invites us into his mind, where he is running and running, singing "Windmills of Your Mind"... Ten times faster than it should ever be sung...
    
    **Monster:** And on the outside... I'm very _calm_... (Beat) AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    
-   _Bombshell_, the central Show Within a Show of _Smash_, features a song-and-dance called "Let's Be Bad" that shows a drug-addled Marilyn Monroe barely making it through a movie's musical number and not knowing whether the crew's effusive praise is real or not.
-   An episode of _Today's Special_ has a sketch featuring three people singing "I Am Slowly Going Crazy," mentioned below.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Randy Orton's current entrance theme, _Voices_ by Rev Theory<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , fits this structure. It's about finding strength in madness and nihilism.
-   Io Shirai's Rage Breaking Point and eventual Face–Heel Turn in 2019 was illustrated/visualized during video promos using Poppy's "Scary Mask". The song is actually about social anxiety, but the lyrics still correlates well to Io's obsession of winning the NXT Women's Title and her snapping when she failed repeatedly.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Muppet Treasure Island_ has a big set piece number called "Cabin Fever", when the ship is becalmed and the crew go a BIT bonkers. As soon as the song ends, however, everything goes back to normal, and the only person who seems to remember the number is Clueless Morgan.

    Theater 

-   "The Ballad of Sara Berry" from _35MM: A Musical Exhibition_ is about the titular character trying to become the prom queen, growing more and more obsessed with it until she ends up killing all the other candidates to win by default.
-   In classical music this is a stock convention of Bel Canto opera — the heroine is so overcome with grief at the tragic circumstances that she finds herself in that she goes temporarily or permanently insane, and has a "mad scene." Basically just an excuse for the composer to write amazing vocal pyrotechnics. One of the most famous and possibly the Trope Codifier for opera is the mad scene from Donizetti's _Lucia di Lammermoor_. Outside of bel canto, probably the most notable one (and definitely the most famous _male_ mad scene in opera) is the titular character's final aria in _Peter Grimes_.
-   "Lot's Wife" in _Caroline, Or Change_, in which a broken Caroline screams at God, losing (then regaining) her sanity as she comes to terms with the fact that she'll never escape her circumstances. Also qualifies as The Eleven O'Clock Number and, to a lesser extent, a Grief Song.
-   "The Destruction" in both versions of _Carrie the Musical_, which depicts the title character's mental breakdown after being humiliated at the prom.
-   _The Devil_, a rock-meets-classical take on the Faust legend, has "Mad Gretchen", where Gretchen is overwhelmed by what is happening to John, and, well...
-   Though best remembered for being one of musical theatre's most amazing pieces, "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going," from _Dreamgirls_, is one of these. Effie, who's singing it, has just been kicked out of the Dreams and abandoned by Curtis, the group's manager and her former lover (and the father of her unborn child). As he starts to leave, she begins to sing the song to him. Though it starts out openly defiant, Effie gradually loses her confidence—and mind—as she has a total mental breakdown from the grief and strain; a (frequently-cut) verse has her outright _throwing_ herself at Curtis and begging him not to go. By the time she gets to the bridge of the song, Curtis isn't even on the stage any more, but Effie is still singing—and even screaming—as if he was in front of her as she goes into denial and rage. This is most apparent when the song is placed in the context of the show; most cover versions play it up as stronger and more confident by removing the heavily painful overtones.
-   "A Man Could Go Quite Mad" and "Both Sides of the Coin" from _Drood._
-   _Frankenstein (2014)_ has "The Grand Beginning of the History of the Creation of Life", in which the execution of Victor's dear friend Henri (who died in Victor's place) pushes him to enact the plans he's been preparing for ages, to create life — namely, to resurrect Henri. Some Deathly Dies Irae and a lot more, as the song shifts from melody to melody, reflecting Victor's grief.
-   Bruce has "Edges of the World" in _Fun Home_ just before he kills himself.
-   "Eternity" from _Fly by Night_ is about Harold and Crabble going a little bit mad, working in an endless, tedious sandwich shop.
-   _Hamilton_:
    -   A downplayed version: Alexander briefly freaks out during "The World Was Wide Enough" (to be fair, dying will do that to you), repeating "rise up, rise up" over and over, but gets it back together for his final lines.
    -   It's played straight in the same song for Aaron Burr, who becomes more and more irrational with each line, until he eventually breaks down and shoots Hamilton in a rage.
-   JD in _Heathers_ has "Meant To Be Yours". We know before this that he's not entirely sane, but there was always a little bit of hope holding out, in songs like "Seventeen". This song, with its violent outbursts, terrifying lyrics, and crazy time signature changes makes sure it's painfully obvious just how far gone JD is.
-   "Down With Love" from _Hooray For What!_ is sometimes this. Barbra Streisand and Audra McDonald have both done it this way, and it's _awesome._
-   Frollo's song in the stage show for _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_. Unlike the Disney version where he declares that he will have Esmeralda for himself or kill her so that no one else will, the stage Frollo goes into how deep his obsession runs. He knows as a man of God that it's forbidden for him to form a relationship with a woman. However, he feels something for Esmeralda that he never felt before and it's driving him insane. Like the title suggests ("Tu Vas Me Detruire"/"Your Love Will Kill Me"), he's worried that his feelings towards Esmeralda will be the death of him.
-   "The World Has Gone Insane" from _Jekyll & Hyde_.
-   Judas' final song in _Jesus Christ Superstar_.
-   In "Aiutami" from _The Light in the Piazza_, Fabrizio has a meltdown over what he thinks is the end of him and Clara. His father, brother, and sister-in-law get sucked into the madness, encouraged by his mother.
    
    So, give me suspicion
    
    That's good
    
    Give me tears
    
    Yes
    
    So, give me passion
    
    That's right
    
    Passion, passion
    
-   "The Madness of King Scar" from the stage version of The Lion King. If you thought Scar was a Large Ham in the movie...
-   In _The Medium_ by Gian-Carlo Menotti, Baba has a long lugubrious soliloquy late in the second act, wondering what is causing her to be so afraid. She tries to laugh it off, but it doesn't help her out of her despair.
-   _Les Misérables_ features Inspector Javert's stunning closer:
    
    And must I now begin to doubt,
    
    Who never doubted all these years?
    
    My heart is stone and still it trembles
    
    The world I have known is lost in shadow.
    
-   "Can't Keep Out The Night" from _Moby-Dick! The Musical_. Also known as Ahab's sleep-deprived rock-solo freakout.
-   “All You Wanna Do” from ‘’Six!The Musical’’. Katherine Howard’s solo is at first a brag about her promiscuous past but realised that men only want her for sex and she screams her lines at the end.
-   "The Private and Intimate Life of the House" from _Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812_, functions as one for Prince Bolkonsky as we see him have a meltdown when confronted with the effects of aging and mortality while searching for his glasses (which were on his head the whole time). A more subdued one for Princess Mary as well, who is suffering severely from being her father's punching bag and the social isolation that comes with having to be her father's primary caregiver.
    -   In "Sonya & Natasha", Natasha has lost any semblance of rational thought, blinded so much by her infatuation with Anatole and excitement over their supposed elopement that she willingly risks becoming a fallen woman and shuts out Sonya, her "closest friend" according to the opening number.
        -   She goes further off the deep end after her elopement is shut down by Marya D. and it is revealed to her that Anatole is a cad who was already secretly married. Shortly after the song ends, she attempts to kill herself with poison.
    -   In "Letters", Pierre rants about how Napoleon is The Antichrist and he knows he is destined to kill the French general and save his country.
        -   Arguably "The Duel" could count as well, where Pierre gets so furious at Dolokhov's obvious sexual relations with his wife that he challenges the man to a duel he knows he won't win (Dolokhov's identifier in the opening number is even that he's a "crazy good shot").
-   Arguably half the songs in _Next to Normal_, although for a few of them this only becomes apparent later on.
-   "Tu vas me détruire" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in the French musical _Notre-Dame de Paris_.
-   "Calm" from _Ordinary Days_ shows how the stress of grad school life in New York is driving Deb insane. Written as a patter song, the frenetic pace highlights the constant anxiety Deb is experiencing.
-   "Running the Whole Machine"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  from _Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical_ is the song Wheatley sings after taking control of Aperture. He's already Drunk with Power from the start of the song, but when he reveals he wants to keep Chell inside to perform tests for him, he goes off the deep end _fast_. And when GLaDOS insults him one final time at the end of the song, his last shred of sanity disappears as well.
    
    **GLaDOS** You're a moron!  
    **Wheatley:** OH REALLY?!  
    **Choir:** _A moron, a moron, a moron you say?_  
    **Wheatley** _We'll see if that's true. / 'Cause who's getting punched through the floor? / It isn't me..._  
    **Choir:** _So it must be YOU!_  
    **Wheatley:** _RIGHT_ THROUGH THE FLOOR! WHO'S THE MORON NOW?! Ahahaha, HAHAHAHAHA, AHAHAHAHAHA, _AHAHAHAHAHAAA!_
    
-   While it’s not a _completely_ straight example (he’s still sane by the end), “Betrayed” from _The Producers_ definitely has shades of this due to it effectively being a Villian Protagonist Breakdown for Max.
-   _Ragtime_: "Coalhouse's Soliloquy" is this for the title character. "Coalhouse Demands" shows exactly how far his sanity has slipped.
    
    Say goodbye to music.
    
    Say goodbye to light.
    
    Anything I care for,
    
    Take it from my sight.
    
    Let me see no future
    
    Let me hear no sound
    
    Only darkness and pain
    
    The anger and pain
    
    The blood and the pain
    
    They buried my heart in the ground....
    
    In the ground...
    
    When they buried you in the ground.
    
    -   Notably, the above verse is musically identical to Sarah's earlier Sanity Slippage Song, "Your Daddy's Son," which she sings to her and Coalhouse's child (though Coalhouse doesn't know the baby exists, as he abandoned her before he was born). As she remembers the pain and anguish that ultimately led her to try to _kill_ the baby by interring it alive ("When I _buried you_ in the ground"), she has a complete breakdown that leads to a My God, What Have I Done? moment.
-   "Ez a kez utoler" ("This Is The Hand That Will Strike") from the Hungarian version of _Romeo et Juliette: De La Haine a l'Amour_ . While its French counterpart, "C'est le jour", appeared in Act II and served mainly to exposit on Tybalt's obsession with Juliet, the Hungarian version puts it midway through Act I, right after Tybalt has had a major epileptic fit, and the song becomes the frightening yet pity-inducing rant of a clearly unwell man. The way the actor on the DVD performance drops into just _screaming_ is seriously terrifying.
-   Moritz in _Spring Awakening_ starts to sound rather crazy in "Don't Do Sadness" as he is driven to suicide, and accuses the world around him to be a cold, uncaring one. It seems like a combination of this and a normal BSoD Song.
    
    Awful sweet to be a little butterfly
    
    Just wingin' over things, and nothin' deep inside.
    
    Nothing going, going wild in you, you know.
    
    You're slowing by the riverside, or floatin' high and blue!
    
-   Stephen Sondheim really seems to like these:
    -   "Rose's Turn" from _Gypsy_.
    -   "Getting Married Today" from _Company_.
    -   The entire "Loveland" sequence from _Follies._
    -   _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_: The title character's awesome Villain Song "Epiphany" is about him completely losing it after his first attempt at revenge goes wrong, and declaring a vendetta upon the entire human race.
    -   Franklin Shepard Inc from _Merrily We Roll Along_.
    -   "Boom Crunch", the Witch's erratic showstopper that was cut from _Into the Woods_, fits this trope to a T. Its replacement, "Last Midnight", is tamer. In either version, the Witch lectures the protagonists and then goes crazy and curses herself to disappear.
-   "Mr. Andrews' Vision" from _Titanic: The Musical_, where the ship's builder, Mr. Andrews, suffers a nervous breakdown as he realizes that the compromises he made in his design to accommodate the first class are the reason the 'Titanic' is doomed. As the ship sinks, he frantically redesigns his blueprints until he breaks off, visualizing the final moments of those who are left aboard the ship. As the song ends, he is crushed to death by a piece of heavy furniture.
-   The extremely aptly named "The Breakdown" from _We Are the Tigers_ is about as textbook with this trope as it gets. It also overlaps heavily with a textbook Villain Song, given that this is the song that reveals who killed Chess and Farrah.
-   "No Good Deed" from _Wicked_ is a song about Elphaba rocketing through the 7 stages of grief before her sanity shatters like glass around 3/4 of the way through, ending with her succumbing to the title and guise of "Wicked Witch of the West".

    Video Games 

-   A rather interesting variation from Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep - A Fragmentary Passage involves Aqua's Leitmotif. The main version of her theme is gentle and melancholic, but her fight with her mirror image comes with a chilling remix that perfectly represents the toll the Realm of Darkness has taken on her mind.
-   The game Portal ends with the creepy song "Still Alive" sung by the crazy antagonist master computer GLaDOS. The song is about how the computer might have survived the ending which killed it, how it's glad it lost (not really), sung with a light-hearted catchy tune.
-   _Tadpole Treble_:
    
    -   The secret pause menu song starts out as a catchy ragtime tune encouraging the player to take a break before things start to descend into madness.
    
    _FREE ME FROM THE PAAAAUSE MENU SOOONG! (We're... we're trapped here forever!)_
    
    -   The final boss's song has some undertones of this.
    
    Hey, Baton, we could just keep rockin' girl
    
    And we'll rock 'till we die or go INSANE!
    

    Web Animation 

-   "Off to the Henhouse" from Episode Three of _Of Weasels And Chickens_. In this song, Prima, a psychotic weasel, sings about the wonders of killing chickens.
    
    _We’re off to the henhouse, Marcus! That’s where we’ll get our food.  
    It’s a long process, fun, regardless – and the killing feels so good!  
    Screams filling all my senses, chickens helpless, defenseless,  
    Why, it really sends a thrill when innocent blood I spill!_
    

    Web Comics 

-   Homestuck: There are three Flashes concerning Sanity Slippage: "\[S\] John: Mental Breakdown" accompanied by Hardlyquin, "\[S\] Karkat: Mental Breakdown" with Frustracean, and finally "\[S\] MSPA Reader: Mental Breakdown" accompanied by Hello Zepp from \[\[Film:Saw the Saw movies\]\]. The first two are fairly comedic, while the last... isn't.

    Web Original 

-   "Slipping"(!) from _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_. "My Eyes" conveys an increasingly depressed, cynical mindset, but "Slipping" is flat-out out mad. Also possible are "Brand New Day" and "Everything You Ever", But in theory the entire musical can be considered a downward spiral.
    -   Also in _Commentary! The Musical_, Dr. Horrible's musical commentary, "All About the Art" and to an even greater extent, "Neil's Song" are perfect examples of this trope.
        
        "_What was his name?  
        What should I say?  
        The choices are endless...  
        And here I am, at last alone, and friendless...  
        No I'm not friendless.  
        I've got some friends!  
        They'll be here when this ends...  
        **If** this ends..._"
        
-   The Nostalgia Chick plays the Barber Of Seville overture whenever she's driven to madness by Fridge Logic.
-   Linkara resorts to "Combine Harvesters" by The Wurzels during his freak-outs.
-   The Nostalgia Critic has either the chorus of "Flagpole Sitta" by Harvey Danger or the "William Tell Storm" by Gioachino Rossini play whenever he loses his mind.
-   Twisted Translations, naturally plays this for laughs with "Google Translate Sings Try Everything", which turns "Try Everything" into one of these for Gazelle.

    Western Animation 

-   John Weldon's 1996 short film "Scant Sanity" is essentially a multi-part, animated Sanity Slippage Song.
-   Played with in the _Futurama_ episode "The Sting" in that Leela does not sing, but she's imagining the others singing (and participating in a Disney Acid Sequence).
    
    **Leela:** I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive. But when I'm awake, my mind plays tricks on me.  
    **Hermes:** Oh, take it easy, Leela.  
    **Amy:** In every life we have some trouble.  
    **Bender:** But when you worry, you make it double.  
    **Amy:** And _(suddenly starts singing)_ don't worry, be happy!  
    _(The song goes on until it concludes and the scene returns to normal.)_  
    **Leela:** Uh, were you just singing?  
    **Bender:** No, I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing. Court order.
    
-   The Ice King gets one in the episode "I Remember You" of _Adventure Time_, with bonus Tear Jerker points as it's addressed to and _sung by_ Marceline, who is reading the notes that her old friend Simon scribbled down trying to explain why he was slipping away just when she, a little girl, needed him most. Yikes.
    -   The episode "Simon and Marcy" has Simon (The Ice King) sing the song "Where Everybody Knows Your Name" as he fights his Sanity Slippage.
    -   Finn's song "Baby's Building A Tower Into Space", which he sings as he obsessively builds a tower to space so he can find his father and rip his arm off.
-   _The Ghost and Molly McGee_: In "Ready, Set, Snow!", Molly goes outside to have fun on a snow day even though her family and friends would rather stay inside and cozy up by the fire. While outside, Molly sings an upbeat song about having fun in the snow despite the bitter cold, slowly but surely going insane as she tries to stay positive and convince herself she's in the right.
    
    _This is awesome, I feel no pain,_
    
    _I think there might be icicles inside my brain_
    
    _But I'll contain my composure while dying of exposure_
    
    _'Cause there's no way I'm missing even one little second of a snow day_
    

    Other 

-   According to one of her routines, Maria Bamford, on advice from her therapist, has come up with an "anxiety song" that she sings to reassure herself and fight off all her various neuroses.
    
    If I keep the kitchen floor clean, no one will die  
    As long as I clench my fists at odd intervals, then the darkness within me won't force me to do anything inappropriately viiii-lent or sexual at dinner parties...  
    As long as I keep humming the tune, I won't "turn gay"  
    It can't getcha if you're singin' a song! Yeah!
