Left to right: Michelle ("pretty"), Maggie ("mannish"), Anita ("childish"), Nenene ("Team Mom").

_"Together, it was as if we formed one single, complete person.  
Wild, unstoppable Bridget.  
Shy and beautiful Lena.  
Tibby, the rebel.  
And me, Carmen, the writer."_

Related to both The Three Faces of Eve and Four-Temperament Ensemble. Unrelated, however, to Four Is Death. Usually.

This particular ensemble typically consists of:

-   A sweet-naïve girl (usually The Ditz).
-   A tomboyish one (usually a Deadpan Snarker).
-   A pretty/sexy one (a Really Gets Around type or perhaps merely a glamour-obsessed pretty one).
-   An admirable kind of character (usually the narrator and wise Team Mom of the group who holds it together).

The admirable character might be The Smart Gal or the Cool Big Sis or the Team Mom. Otherwise, the mother figure will be doubled up with either the sweet-naive girl, the sexy girl or even the mannish one.

This ensemble can typically be found in Schoolgirl Series. Compare Town Girls. See also Beauty, Brains, and Brawn. For the Spear Counterpart to this group, see Four-Man Band.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _A Channel_ has Run (The Ditz), Tooru (The Caretaker), Nagi (Only Sane Man) and Yuuko (The one with the model-like body).
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: Suzu's group from middle school fit The Three Faces of Eve, with Suzu as the Wife (sweet and motherly), Yayo the Seductress (energetic and openly sexual), and Lu the Child (quiet and cute, though she's neither younger nor entirely innocent). In high school, Matsuri becomes the "tomboy" of the group, which they then dub "Kachofugetsu" based on the first kanji in their surnames. In a twist, Matsuri is actually a boy who was turned female and still identifies as male, he just presents himself publicly as a tomboyish girl (even to Yayo and Lu).
-   _Black★Rock Shooter_ anime ended with Mato, Yuu, Kagari, and Yomi as this.
-   The Knight Sabers in _Bubblegum Crisis_ — Nene is the cute naive one; Linna is a dancer with a different boyfriend every episode; Priss has the bad attitude and tomboyish ways, and Sylia is the boss who keeps them all working together as a team.
    -   Played differently in _Tokyo 2040_ — Nene was still the cute one, Linna switched to The Quiet One, Priss was the mannish/straightforward one, and Sylia was the worldly one with severe issues under her smile.
-   _A Certain Scientific Railgun_ has the Tomboy Misaka, the Ojou Kuroko, the cute Uiharu and the one who tries to be a Genki Girl Saten.
    -   Similarly, Team ITEM from both series fits this with the Yandere Mugino, the ill girl Rikou, the Genki Girl Saiai, and the Mad Bomber Badass Normal Frenda. They lose this trope after Frenda dies and is eventually replaced by Shiage.
-   _Day Break Illusion_ has Akari (sweet and helpful), Luna (shy and reserved), Seira (cold and cynical), and Ginka (bright and fearless). The show is generally darker than other examples of this trope but still fits.
-   Since only about two members of its cast are male, _Doujin Work_ also has an example. Innocent Sora, quiet Tsuyuri, tomboyish Najimi, and the Office Lady Kaneru.
-   _Encouragement of Climb_ has this with Hinata (pushy, go-getter) and Aoi (ditzy and naive, the girly-girl to Hinata's tomboy), Kokona (pretty, feminine) and Kaeda (kind, experienced).
-   _Gabriel Dropout_ parodies the trope by having girls with mostly negative traits, featuring: Otaku Surrogate and Deadpan Snarker Gabriel, Only Sane Woman, and Team Mom Vignette, ditzy Butt-Monkey Satanichia, and Ojou Raphiel.
-   _Galaxy Angel_ has Milfeulle, the girly one; Forte, the Bifauxnen obsessed with firearms; Ranpha, the boy-crazy one; and Vanilla, the Emotionless Girl and silent observer.
-   _Genesis of Aquarion_ has the female Element Users: Silvia de Alisia (tomboyish and short-tempered), Reika (sensitive and has the most bad luck), Rena Rune (vampire loli), and Tsugumi Rosenmeier (in love with Reika).
-   _Hidamari Sketch_ centers around cheerful teen Yuno, Genki Girl Miyako, Hiro (weight-conscious "wife material"), and stoic writer Sae. It may no longer be one after the addition of Nori and Nazuna.
-   The girls of Issei's harem in the first season of _High School D×D_ certainly fit this with: innocent nun Asia Argento, stoic tough as nails badass Koneko Tojou, the sexy and flirtatious Akeno Himejima, and the team leader Rias Gremory. Obviously, it no longer counts as the harem gets larger and larger.
-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ has the Erika (oblivious to all matters related to love and the least studious of the four), Maki (a Tsundere and the only one with male friends), Kashiwagi (the only one with a boyfriend and an active sex life), and Karen (the mediator of the group, though not without her own obsessions). That said, this only really applies in the _We Want to Talk About Kaguya_ spin-off due to Karen and Erika rarely showing up in the main series.
-   _Knight Hunters_:
    -   Quirky Miniboss Squad/Evil Counterpart team Schreient in the original anime series, with Nanami/Tot as the sweet naive one, Asuka/Neu as the tough one, Karen/Schoen (German for beautiful) as the vain pretty one, and Chizuru/Hel as the sensible leader.
    -   It's notable that the four _male_ protagonists fit the trope rather neatly as well, with Omi as the sweet naive one (at least compared to the others; given that all four are assassins, none of them can be _very_ naive), Ken as the masculine tough guy, Yoji as the Handsome Lech, and Aya as — albeit not always the _wise_ one — the one who tends to exert the most authority in times of uncertainty or disagreement. The roles become even more apparent in _Weiß Kreuz Glühen_ with Sena replacing Omi as the sweet, naive one and Aya growing more fully into the role of the wisest and most emotionally balanced one.
-   _K-On!_ has the ditzy Yui, genki Ritsu, the outstandingly attractive though withdrawn Mio, and the very wealthy yet warm and friendly Mugi. Then Azusa joins the club.
-   _Lucky Star_ brings us two sets of four girls (they were even grouped as such in their Image Song releases).
    -   The first group has the sweet Cloud Cuckoo Lander Tsukasa, Otaku Surrogate Konata, Moe Meganekko Miyuki, and Deadpan Snarker Tsundere Kagami.
    -   The second group has cheerful ill girl Yutaka, the quiet Minami, Cosplay Otaku Girl Patricia, and the most otaku of them all, Yuri Fan Hiyori.
        -   In the manga, the second group is in fact a three-group. Patricia does not become affiliated with Yutaka in any way until volume 7, and is just a minor recurring character, appearing only in Omake until that point; she joined the group much earlier in the anime thanks to becoming an Ascended Extra.
-   _Magical Pokaan_'s four girls. Yuuma is the sweet and naive mage, Liru the tomboyish werewolf, the vain vampiress Pachira, and the calm observer android Aiko.
-   Played With in _My Hero Academia_ with the pro hero team Wild, Wild Pussycats. There's The Ditz Ragdoll, the sexy one Pixie Bob, the Team Mom Mandalay, and the "tomboy" Tiger who's biologically female but had a sex change in Thailand a long time ago and is, for all intents and purposes, a tall, muscular man.
-   _Naruto_ has the Konoha kunoichi: Sakura Haruno (ambitious and short-tempered, used to be shy), Ino Yamanaka (elegant and confident), Hinata Hyuga (shy and gentle), Tenten (tomboyish and fierce).
-   _Natsuiro Kiseki_'s main four childhood friends. The stubborn and tomboyish Natsumi, the realist and mature Saki, the hyperactive and childish Yuka, and the laid-back and quiet Rinko.
-   _Pretty Cure_ has teams that are composed of four girls.
    -   _Fresh Pretty Cure!_: excitable Love/Cure Peach, down-to-earth Miki/Cure Berry, introverted Inori/Cure Pine, and misunderstood yet tranquil former villain Setsuna/Cure Passion.
    -   _HeartCatch Pretty Cure!_: Shy Tsubomi/Cure Blossom, excitable Erika/Cure Marine, friendly Itsuki/Cure Sunshine, and wistful Yuri/Cure Moonlight.
    -   _Doki Doki! PreCure_ pre-Aguri; lovable Mana/Cure Heart, smart Rikka/Cure Diamond, innocent Alice/Cure Rosetta, and stern Makoto/Cure Sword.
    -   _HappinessCharge Pretty Cure!_ has excitable Megumi/Cure Lovely, naive Hime/Cure Princess, friendly Yuko/Cure Honey, and former loner Iona/Cure Fortune.
    -   _Go! Princess Pretty Cure_: Genki Girl Haruka/Cure Flora, wise Minami/Cure Mermaid, stylish Kirara/Cure Twinkle, and sheltered Towa/Cure Scarlet.
    -   ''Star★Twinkle Pretty Cure pre-Yuni; curious Hikaru/Cure Star, innocent Lala/Cure Milky, Team Mom Elena/Cure Soleil, and graceful Madoka/Cure Selene.
    -   _Healin' Good♡Pretty Cure_: Gentle Nodoka/Cure Grace, smart Chiyu/Cure Fontaine, genki Hinata/Cure Sparkle, and naive Asumi/Cure Earth.
    -   _Tropical-Rouge! Pretty Cure_ pre-Laura; genki Manatsu/Cure Summer, shy Sango/Cure Coral, smart Minori/Cure Papaya, and Hot-Blooded Asuka/Cure Flamingo.
    -   _Delicious Party♡Pretty Cure_: Naive Yui/Cure Precious, aloof Kokone/Cure Spicy, genki Ran/Cure Yum-Yum, and wise Amane/Cure Finale.
    -   _Hirogaru Sky! Pretty Cure_: pre-Ellee; Hot-Blooded Sora/Cure Sky, gentle Mashiro/Cure Prism, smart Tsubasa/Cure Wing, and Team Mom Ageha/Cure Butterfly.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_'s four main Puella Magi: Madoka (sweet, idealistic, naïve), Sayaka (tomboyish, justice-obsessed, romance-oriented), Kyoko (cynical, ambitious, a Lad-ette) and Homura (calm, experienced, smart). Mami initially played the role of the wise, experienced one as well, before dying gruesomely.
-   _R.O.D the TV_ plays with this. (See page image.) Broadly speaking, Anita is a cute Bratty Half-Pint, Maggie a Gentle Giant, Michelle Obliviously Beautiful, and Nenene the Team Mom. Past this point, though, the traits start being sorted out somewhat differently - Anita tends towards being a pragmatist when Michelle is The Ditz, and Maggie has more of a Sugar-and-Ice Personality while Nenene takes on the role of Deadpan Snarker.
-   _Sailor Moon_.
    -   Ami/Mercury is The Smart One and The Quiet One, Rei/Mars is the Ojou and the Deadpan Snarker, Makoto/Jupiter is The Tomboy (in the anime) and the Team Mom (in the manga), and Minako/Venus combines The Sexy One and The Ditz.
    -   And so do the four Outer Senshi: Setsuna/Pluto is the Team Mom, Michiru/Neptune is The Quiet One and the Ojou, Haruka/Uranus is The Tomboy and the Deadpan Snarker, and Hotaru/Saturn is The Cutie.
    -   Early in the series, Usagi is the sweet-naive one, Naru is the sensible, admirable one, Kuri is the tomboyish one, and Yumiko is the pretty, feminine one.
-   In _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_, Chibodee Crocket's "Angels" is a four girl ensemble. Shirley is the Team Mom, Cath is The Quiet One, Janet is the Genki Girl and Bunny is both a Meganekko and The Ditz (though she tries to do things right).
    -   Athrun's harem also count. Cagalli is the serious one, Meer is _definitely_ the sexy one, Lunamaria is the Genki Girl and her sister Meyrin is The Quiet One.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_'s Bridge Bunnies in season 2. Sumeragi is the Team Mom, Feldt is The Quiet One, Mileina is the Genki Girl and Marie aka Souma is the friendly one.
-   _School-Live!_ has one consisting of the immature Genki Girl Yuki, the Action Girl Kurumi, the distant bookworm Miki, and the Team Mom Yuuri.
-   _School Rumble_'s primary cast locks up. Innocent and naive Tenma, tomboyish Mikoto, the Ojou Eri, and Akira, the silent, snarky observer.
-   _S.S. Astro_ has The Ditz Izumi, tomboyish Setsuna, Girly girlish Yuko, and mature(?) Kaname.
-   _Tantei Opera Milky Holmes_: Has The Ditz Sherlock/Sheryl, Bokukko Nero, Cloud Cuckoo Lander Cordelia and the Shrinking Violet Hercule. Also G4 has Jerkass Kokoro, Huge Schoolgirl Tsugiko, The Stoic Saku and the polite Karate-chopping Hirano.
-   _Red Garden_ has the sweet and shy Rose, the tomboyish Claire, the rich and fashionable Rachel, and the also rich but more reserved Kate.
-   Lum, Oyuki, Benten, and Ran in _Urusei Yatsura_, although the trope is played with. Lum is the pretty one, Benten is the tomboy, Oyuki is the mature admirable one, but Ran only _seems_ the ditzy/naive one at first sight but she's actually Cute and Psycho and a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing.
-   _YuruYuri_ has Akari (The Ditz), Yui (Deadpan Snarker), Kyouko (The Leader), and Chinatsu, who has the most obvious desires toward another classmate. There's also an ensemble of four student council members, composed of three tsunderes and a Shipper on Deck.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Jet Dream_, Jet is the leader. Petite is the sexy (stereotypically French) one. Marlene is the big girl who can out-wrestle most men, and Ting-a-Ling is the sweet, naive one.
-   Riley, Merissa, Lona, and Ren, in The New York Four.
-   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: During the arc that results in Diana's banishment from Olympus and return as Wonder Woman the kind but pragmatic Donna Troy, brash and impulsive Artemis, tomboyish and excitable Cassie, and clever but idealistic Georgia team up to take down an evil supercomputer George came accross. George is quite shocked at just how dangerously impulsive Artemis is despite being a superhero and Donna acts as the Big Sister Mentor to the group.
-   "The Four Marys" from _Bunty._ Sensitive violinist Mary Cotter tends to be the sweet one, Passionate Sports Girl Mary Field is the tomboyish one, aristocratic activist Mary Radleigh tends is the somewhat wild risk taker while working class scholarship girl Mary Simpson is the most sensible of the group.

    Fan Works 

-   The LDD-fanfic _Bridge to Terabithia 2: The Last Time_ does this in the second half of the story, where Jess and Leslie, both teenagers, ends up furthering their studies in California and forming a clique with a bunch of new characters. With Leslie Burke as the Team Mom, Amelia Edmunds who fits the Really Gets Around criteria, Sally Atkins the Token Lesbian who is the tomboyish snarker, and naive valley girl Caitlyn Freece as The Ditz.
-   The _Discworld_ fic _The Graduation Class_ covers four mature entrants through their training to become full Assassins. The four women candidates fill these four niches: Johaana Smith-Rhodes is the pretty ditz, Alice Band the mannish rather butch one, Emmanuelle Lapoignard les Deux-Epees is the one who's been around the block a few times (Alice snarkily sums the three up as _the virgin, the dyke and the nymphomaniac. What a trio we make._) They are bonded together by the older Team Mum type, Joan Sanderson-Reeves.
-   In _Horseshoes and Hand Grenades_, the Kamen Rider Club Girls consist of Lovable Alpha Bitch Miu Kazashiro, Genki Girl and Otaku Yuki Jojima, Perky Goth Tomoko Nozama and Cool Big Sis Erin Suda. Its side story _Month of Sundays_ has Camera Fiend Mari Yamamoto, Pom-Pom Girl Jun Shigeno, Huge Schoolgirl Rumi Egawa and Yayoi Tokuda bringing up the rear as the Knowledge Broker.
-   In _Power Rangers: Shuriken Force_, the four rangers fit this. Sweet and shy Kit, sad and cynical Ann, angry and outspoken Lila, girly and cheerful Zara. There's a fifth ranger, but he's The One Guy on the team.
-   In _The Story of Apollo, Daphne and Luca: An Italian Tragedy_ we have brash and outspoken Giulia as the tomboyish one, sweet and romantic Rosa as the naive one, snarky and introverted Bianca as the aloof/mysterious one and Caterina as the motherly/admirable one.

    Film — Animated 

-   In _Turning Red_, Mei is the naive one, Miriam is the Team Mom, Priya is the tomboyish one, and Abby is the pretty one.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Ali & Ratu Ratu Queens_: The Queens, a group of old friends on the cusp of opening their own restaurant:
    -   Party is the admirable, motherly one; she's easily the most normal of the four of them and does the most connecting with Mia.
    -   Chinta is the pretty one; she's a Granola Girl with a storied romantic and sexual history.
    -   Ajeng is the tomboyish one; she's brash, tough, and dresses the most masculine.
    -   Biyah is the funny one; she has a loud sense of humor and the most physical comedy of the four.
-   The four girl coven in _The Craft_: Sarah, the wise one; Nancy, the Deadpan Snarker Goth who doesn't care what other people think of her; Bonnie, who becomes increasingly image-obsessed and vain; and Rochelle, the sweet, quiet one (and Token Minority) who just wants the Alpha Bitch to stop her racist taunts.
-   The four main characters of _Now and Then_: Roberta is the tomboy, Teeny the diva, Chrissy the sweet naive one and Samantha the observer.
-   _High School Musical_ has Kelsi as the sweet one, Taylor as the aggressive, snarky one, Sharpay as the sexy, fashionable one and Gabriella as the thoughtful, wise one.
-   The four girls from the _Bratz_ movie, Jade (smart), Sasha (sexy), Cloe (sporty), and Yasmine (preppy). The Alpha Bitch immediately breaks them up due to her obsession with keeping cliques separate for some reason.
-   The four main friends of _The Women_, an In Name Only Chick Flick of a play, who are basically the _Sex and the City_ girls if Samantha was replaced by a Sassy Black Woman Lesbian(?).
-   The starring _D.E.B.S._ squad is pretty much a textbook case with promiscuous Dominique, naive Janet, obsessive Max and self searching Amy.
-   In _John Tucker Must Die_ you have the admirable Kate, sexy cheerleader Heather, mannish Go-Getter Girl Carrie and ditzy Granola Girl Beth.
-   The 50s film _So Young, So Bad_ gives us Jane as the innocent, childish Morality Pet. Loretta the wannabe seductress is the pretty one. Jackie the Ambiguously Gay tough girl as the mannish one. Social worker Ruth is the Team Mom.
-   The 1989 cult classic _Heathers_ has a clique of this, with "Mythic Bitch" Heather Chandler (sexy), head cheerleader Heather McNamara (sweet), bookworm Heather Duke (snarky), and the clique's newcomer Veronica Sawyer (wise).
-   The Spiritual Successor to the above film, _Mean Girls_, plays with this trope. Cady Heron, the main character and narrator of the film, is undoubtedly the admirable one/Team Mom, as she tries to help the other girls and make things right once things get out of control. Karen is the Ditz with very little actual meanness in her body—the sweet-naive one. Regina could fit into either category of the tomboyish one or the sexy one, being a very aggressive, dominant Deadpan Snarker but also the Vanity Is Feminine and Really Gets Around type. Regina gradually loses her overt femininity, and Gretchen begins filling that role (the sexy/pretty one) as that happens.
-   The 2004 film _Sleepover_ has style-savvy Fashionista Farrah (the pretty/sexy one), sweet, insecure Yancy (the sweet-naïve one), Leader and Team Mom Hannah (the admirable one), and ordinary, somewhat sporty Girl Next Door Julie (the tomboyish one). Though the roles of Hannah and Julie somewhat overlap; Julie is caring and also tries to be cautious and responsible, while Hannah is outspoken, competitive and reckless in a tomboyish way.

    Literature 

-   The _American Girl_ books have in Josefina's series the four Montoya sisters. Ana is the oldest and the Team Mom (literally, since their mother is dead and she's been taking over the domestic side of the household herself (and alone until Dolores arrives), plus she's already married with two kids); Francisca is the beautiful, fashionable, rebellious one; Clara is the diligent, prudent, and preachy one; and Josefina is the youngest and the main character, who's chirpy and cheerful and tries to keep the peace between Francesca and Clara when Ana's not around to help.
-   _American Street_ by Ibi Zoboi focuses on a young Haitian girl who immigrates to Detriot and lives with her aunt and three cousins. Her cousins as a whole are called "The Four Bees": Eldest Chantal is something of the Team Mom and the one who could have gone to an Ivy League had it not been for her mother's health is "Brains", twin Donna is the sexy one who is "Beauty" and dates a drug-dealer who beats her, Butch Lesbian twin Pri (Tomboyish Name for "Princess") is the "Brawn" who constantly combats people, and Naïve Everygirl and Nice Girl Fabioula is a good student who is trying to navigate the dysfunction of her new surroundings and American culture while holding on to her Haitian values and spirituality while questioning the actions of her family and circumstances is "Brave".
-   _The Anderssons_ by Solveig Olsson-Hultgren follows this trope with the four original Andersson sisters. Elin is the most "mannish" one, who used to have a tough job at a paper mill. Mandi is the sweet and naive one, who ends up in a bad marriage. Ida Sofia is The Smart Gal and the Book Worm. Greta is the sexy one, who works within fashion.
-   _Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret._ has the "Four Pre-Teen Sensations" — Gretchen is the somewhat mannish one, Janie is shy and sweet, Nancy is very boy-crazy, and Margaret is the narrator who sees everything.
-   The original four members of _The Baby-Sitters Club_: Kristy is known for her leadership skills and great ideas, which along with her outgoing nature make her a good softball coach. Mary Anne is good at being organized but she has a sensitive and shy nature. Claudia is a passionate artist and is known for her creativity and fashion sense as well as being boy-crazy. Last of all there is Stacey who is like Claudia but a more sophisticated math genius who is looked up to because she's from New York.
-   The _Chalet School_ has the Quartet in the early books. Joey is the tomboy and the leader, Simone is the temperamental Clingy Jealous Girl, Frieda is the Team Mom and the best-behaved, and Marie is the pretty one.
-   In _The Clique_, the titular group initially consists of Passionate Sports Girl Kristen, intimidatingly beautiful Alicia, goofy Dylan, and the leader of the group, Massie.
-   J. Courtney Sullivan's novel _Commencement,_ about a group of Smith students who become friends after sharing a floor their freshmen year, has: Celia, who probably fulfills the role of the "sexy one" as she is a Hard-Drinking Party Girl who Really Gets Around, even though she's not the prettiest of the group; Bree, who is the "sweet naive one" - she starts out as an engaged Southern Belle; Sally, a Neat Freak who serves as the Team Mom; and April, who fits the role of the "tomboy" as a Straw Feminist, Granola Girl and Deadpan Snarker.
-   _The Complete Writer's Guide to Heroes & Heroines_ details different types of heroines generally found in the romance genre. The three closest to this trope are Spunky Kid / Boss / Seductress / Nurturer.
-   _45 Master Characters_ is a Book on Trope that has eights types of heroines, and while different combinations could work, in general the Persephone / Artemis / Aphrodite / Hera types fit for those of this trope.
-   In _The Gallagher Girls_ series, there's Cammie, Liz, Bex, and Macey. The latter three fill out the roles for Beauty, Brains, and Brawn (Macey is the beauty, Liz is the brains, and Bex is the brawn), while Cammie is more of a Girl Next Door.
-   The Baby-Sitters Club\-esque _Girl Talk_ books had Sabrina, the ditzy, bubbly everygirl; Katie, the perfect, blonde-haired, blue-eyed athlete; Allison, the quiet, bookish Token Minority; and Randy, the "cool" one, who was from New York and had a skateboard and played the drums and was probably intended to be the Deadpan Snarker.

-   _James and the Giant Peach_ has James's four female companions: the Ladybug (Team Mom), the Spider (mannish), the Glowworm with her beautiful glow (pretty), and the Silkworm (childish).
-   _Little Women_ is the Trope Codifier: Meg, the oldest, is the lecturer and mature example-setter who wants a husband and family (admirable); Jo is the tomboy who wants a career, fame, and fortune; Beth is the shy, gentle and musical one who wants to stay with her family (sweet); Amy is the vain and spoiled but later artistic and flirty young lady who wants to marry someone with money (pretty).
-   _Mates, Dates series_: Nesta is the pretty/sexy one, Izzie is the wise one, Lucy is the sweet one, and TJ is the smart, tomboyish one.

This book being the kind of book it is, Ruth May, naturally, gets killed off.
-   _Pretty Little Liars_: Emily is the sweet and sporty one, Hanna is glamorous and popular, Aria's the artistic hipster Deadpan Snarker, and Spencer sort of replaces "wise" with "perfectionist". They each represent Aspects of Ali's personality.
-   _The Red Tent_ features Leah the Team Mom and domestic goddess; Rachel the beauty who compensates for her infertility by becoming a midwife; Zilpah the self-proclaimed priestess/storyteller who Does Not Like Men, and Bilhah the sweet, quiet empath.
-   _The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants_ has Lena, who is a shy, introspective aspiring artist, Bridget, who is daring and courageous with gorgeous blond hair, Carmen, who is the organized one and the "glue" keeping the Sisterhood together, and Tibby, who is known as the rebel and disdainful one.
-   Marylin Kaye's _Sisters_ series: Activist Lydia is the Team Mom figure, Cassie is the fashionista, Daphne is the shy and sweet one, Phoebe is the tomboy.
-   The short-lived 1990s YA series _Sleepover Friends_ had Kate (tomboy snarker), Stephanie (fashionable and slightly snobby), Patti (shy sweet one), and Lauren (sensible and level-headed narrator).
-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire_, Oberyn Martell's four adult daughters are known as the Sand Snakes and fulfil these roles in a more dangerous variation. Obara is a butch Action Girl with a penchant for spears (tomboy); Nymeria is a beautiful seductress (sexy); Tyene is a Fake Cutie, outwardly a sweet, pious girl in training to be a priestess and secretly a Master Poisoner ("sweet"). Their fourth sister Sarella (wise) is not introduced with the others, but there are strong hints that she is Disguised in Drag as brainy, guileful master archer "Alleras the Sphinx" in order to infiltrate the One-Gender School where Maesters are trained.
    -   Without Sarella, the fourth spot is filled by their cousin Arianne, who while very sexy is a budding politician and fills the role of the narrator/Team Mom.
-   The four Cullen women of _The Twilight Saga_ are the snarky Bella, childish pixie-like Alice, beautiful Rosalie, and motherly Esme.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Amanda Show_ had a skit called The Girls' Room. It had glamourous, popularity-obsessed Alpha Bitch Amber (a sexy one), tough, intimidating Sassy Black Girl Sheila (a tomboyish one), sweet-natured but completely airheaded Ditz Debbie (a sweet-naive one), and relatively nice and down-to-earth Southern Belle Tammy (an admirable one).
-   _Beverly Hills, 90210_: Annie is the sweet naive girl, Silver is the Deadpan Snarker, Adrianna is the one obsessed with glamour and fame, and Naomi serves as the mother figure for the group.
-   In the original _Beverly Hills_, Donna was the sweet naive one, Brenda was the Deadpan Snarker, Kelly was the pretty one, and Andrea was the smart one.
-   The four students on _Bunheads_. The show hasn't been on long enough to tell but so far Boo is the sweet one, Sasha is the glamorous Ice Queen, Melanie has elements of being The Ditz, and Ginny is the smart one.
-   Although not all four _Charmed_ Ones were on the show at he same time (since Prue died before Paige was introduced), the sisters still fit this trope. Paige was The Ditz, Piper was the Deadpan Snarker, Phoebe was the sexy one, and Prue was the wise Cool Big Sis. Before Paige, Phoebe played a combination of the sexy one and The Ditz. Once Prue passed away, Piper took on her role as the wise Cool Big Sis but still had her Deadpan Snarker traits in tact.
-   _Derry Girls_: The main cast consists of this plus The One Guy James.
    -   There's Cloudcuckoolander Orla (the naive one), who's too out of it to ever bother anyone most of the time.
    -   Lesbian Clare (the snarky, smart one), who flip-flops between being the Only Sane Man and a Nervous Wreck
    -   The (allegedly) promiscuous Hard-Drinking Party Girl Michelle (the sexy one), who's always talking about sex and boys.
    -   The narrator Erin (the admirable one), who thinks of herself as cultured, Wise Beyond Her Years writer, though she's just as prone to mistakes and tomfoolery as everyone else. Although cousins Erin and Orla are approximately the same age, they interact as if Orla was the Annoying Younger Sibling.
-   _Designing Women_: Charlene, Suzanne, Mary Jo, & Julia (owns the business they all work for)
-   _Desperate Housewives_: Susan (ditz), Lynette (snarker), Gabrielle (sexy), and Bree (Team Mom)
-   _Doctor Who_: The first four companions of the new series fit this trope. Rose Tyler is sweet and naive (although she becomes wiser as the series progresses), Martha Jones is wise, smart and sensible, Donna Noble is feisty and outspoken, and Amy Pond, who attempts to seduce the Doctor, is the sexy one.
-   _The Facts of Life_: Blair (glamour-obsessed pretty one), Jo (tomboyish, straight-laced one), Tootie (sweet-naïve, one) & Natalie (quirky, odd one) (students/roommates).
-   _Gilmore Girls_ uncomfortably fits protagonist Rory into this kind of clique in her high-school years. Paris is the Deadpan Snarker, Louise the sexy Really Gets Around type, Madeline is The Ditz and Rory is the admirable narrator.
-   _Girlfriends_: Joan Clayton (smart, straight-laced one), Antoinette 'Toni' Garrett (glamour-obsessed pretty one), Maya Wilkes (streetsmart one) & Lynn Searcy (quirky, odd one) (students/roommates).
-   The girls on, well, _Girls_. Marnie is the level-headed, smart one, Jessa is the sexy free spirit, Shoshanna is the naive ditz, and Hannah is the lazy snarker.
-   _Girls on Top_ (Channel 4's Distaff Counterpart to _The Young Ones_): Jennifer is The Ditz (bordering on Cloud Cuckoo Lander), Amanda is a Straw Feminist, Candice Really Gets Around, and Shelley takes charge... not in a Team Mom way, but in a "I'm the only one who can remotely afford the rent here, so do as I say or else I'll leave" way.
-   _The Golden Girls_: Rose is the ditz, Blanche is the slut, Dorothy is the snarker, and Sophia (Dorothy's mother) the Team Mom. Despite age, Sophia is kind of more the snarker and Dorothy is more the level-headed "mother" type.
-   _Gossip Girl_ has Serena (the sexy, free-spirited one), Blair (acts as overseer if only to re-enforce her image as Queen Bee), Vanessa (the bitter cynic) and Jenny (while not The Ditz in the strictest sense, she is incredibly naive and easily led at times)
-   _Living Single_: Synclaire, Regine, Max, & Khadijah (owns the apartment).
-   _Orphan Black_ has two sets.
    -   The main clone quartet: Sarah is the Rebellious Spirit (tomboy), Alison is the glamorous and cultured soccer mom (feminine), Cosima is the resident scientist and Only Sane Man (intelligent), and Helena is mostly stuck in her own world but is nonetheless a loyal sister (a rather dark version of the sweet one).
    -   The later Clone Club additions: Krystal is The Fashionista Valley Girl (the sexy _and_ pretty one), Charlotte is the good-mannered Tagalong Kid (sweet one), M.K. is the elusive hacker (intelligent), and Tony is the butch one.
-   _Pan Am_: Laura is the sweet, naive one, Maggie is self-righteous and free-spirited, Colette is sexy and romantic and Kate is the independent, Team Mom type (and Cool Big Sis to Laura).
-   Played with somewhat on _Pretty Little Liars_: Hanna definitely fits the glamor-obsessed role; Emily is sort of mannish, insofar as she is an athlete (and a lesbian, but a rather feminine one), although she is definitely not the Deadpan Snarker of the group; Aria is the sweet one, although not naive; Spencer is definitely the Deadpan Snarker, but she is generally also the one who holds the group together, although more through sheer determination and iron will than by being the Team Mom.
-   _Privileged_: Megan (fulfilling the Team Mom role for both the twins and her own sister), Lily (the sexy one, more towards the Really Gets Around end of the scale), Rose (the well-meaning but not too bright Ditz) and Sage (the cynic and Deadpan Snarker)
-   The ladies in waiting on _Reign_ are four friends. Lola is the strongest one, not afraid of death or speaking out, even to a queen. Greer is ambitious for her family's sake even though she does believe in the power of love. Kenna is a real firecracker which makes her unpredictable and totally captivating. Aylee is the most reserved, acting as the voice of caution out of concern for her friends.
-   Short-lived (due to being lost in the merger) WB series _Related_: eldest sister Ginny is the wise one, second-born Ann is the career-focused (least feminine) one, third sister Margie is the flirty one, and Rose is the youngest and most naive.
-   The girls of _S Club 7_ were portrayed this way on their TV show. Hannah was The Ditz, Jo was the mannish one, Rachel was the glamorous one obsessed with her looks, and Tina was the wise one.
-   _Sex and the City_: Charlotte (Idealistic, slightly naive, The "Park Avenue Pollyanna"), Samantha (slutty, cynical), Miranda (Deadpan-snarky, career-focused, less glamourous than her friends), & Carrie (romantic and the narrator who sees everyone's foibles)
-   The early-to-mid 90's NBC series _Sisters_. Interestingly, it was the second-_youngest_ sister Georgie who took on the Team Mom role.
-   _Skins_ has this with each of their female casts:
    -   Though they fit The Three Faces of Eve better, the three main girls of the first generation of Skins fit this, too: Michelle is the sexy one, Cassie is The Ditz (technically a Ditzy Genius), and Jal combines the Deadpan Snarker and the Team Mom.
    -   In the second generation: Effy and Katie split the "sexy" one; Pandora is the sweet, naive one; Naomi is the Deadpan Snarker; and Emily is the wise, nurturing one.
    -   The girls of the third generation too: Mini is the sexy one due to her obsession with being pretty; Grace is the sweet and naive one who believes in stories and fairytales; Liv is the closest to the Deadpan Snarker; and Franky is the wise one.
        -   Alternately, Mini is the pretty, naive one; Liv is the "sexy one" since she Really Gets Around; Grace is the nurturing Team Mom; and Franky is the mannish one.
    -   In the American version, Michelle is the pretty one, Cadie is The Ditz, Tea is the snarky one, and Daisy is the Team Mom.
-   In season seven of _Smallville_, with the arrival of Kara, we have naive (not so much "behind the scenes") Lana, mannish Lois, sexy Kara and wise Chloe.
-   Switch2012 : Grace as the youngest of the group is ostensibly the identification character. Hannah is the useless Naive one and The Ditz. Stella is the Deadpan Snarker. And Jude Really Gets Around.
-   _Victorious_: Tori is the main character, the jack-of-all-trades in terms of talent and the most "normal" of the group. Tori's sister Trina is obsessed with fashion and quite ditzy and girly, Cat is childlike and naive, and Jade is the snarky bad girl of the group.

-   _Girls5eva_: The modern day lineup of Girls5eva as follows — Dawn (admirable leader), Summer (sweet & naive), Wickie (sexy one), and Gloria (snarky tomboy).

    Manhwa 

-   The original girl thief band from _Western Shotgun_ (or _Blazin' Barrels_) known as "Gold Romani" includes four members: Amita Crusoe the hot-headed one, Temmy Valentine the mature one, Gwen Stefani the smart bespectacled strategist and Rommie D. Con the young, fearless mechanic. Later they have Goldie Crembell the airhead join the band.

    Music 

-   SCANDAL has Haruna, Tomomi, Mami, and Rina. There is frequent overlap in who takes on which kind of role, these being actual people and not fictional characters, after all (for instance, both Haruna and Mami take turns being Team Mom, Tomomi alternates between being The Ditz and being the sexy one, etc.).
-   Nina Simone's _Four Women_ more or less describe a more mature and tragic Four Girl Ensemble. First there is Aunt Sarah who is resilient and, perhaps, motherly, then there is Saffronia who may or may not be the naive girl (all we know is that she's bi racial), next there's "Sweet Thing" whose "hips invite you" and to conclude there is Peaches whose "manner is tough".
-   Girl Group Little Mix: Perrie is the sweet naive one, Leigh is the Deadpan Snarker, Jesy is the glamorous one, and Jade is the Mother.
-   Kpop group Sistar fit this description. Bora is the sexy one, Soyou is the ditz, Dasom is the Deadpan Snarker and leader Hyorin is the big sister.
-   The "classic" lineup of The Bangles had (comparatively mannish) Michael, (team mom) Vicki, (babyfaced and underestimated) Debbie, and (spotlight stealer) Susanna.
-   S Club 7 liked to portray the four girls this way. Jo was the tough Lad Ette from Essex. Tina was the bossy, responsible Team Mom. Hannah was the quirky ditz. Rachel was the glamorous beauty who attracted all the boys.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   The 'Four Horsewomen of NXT' fit into this. Bayley was the Kid-Appeal Character who just wanted to be friends with everyone (childish). Charlotte was the jacked, arrogant athlete (mannish). Sasha Banks was the glamorous rhinestone-loving Alpha Bitch (feminine). Becky Lynch meanwhile was the smart, tactical Only Sane Man (intelligent).

    Theater 

-   _Hamilton_ has this trope in the Schuyler Sisters Peggy (sweet, from what we see), Angelica (snarky and tough), and Eliza (motherly), with Maria Reynolds (sexy) completing the group.
-   _In the Heights_ has bright Stanford student Nina, sexy Vanessa who is constantly being pursued by the boys in the barrio, brassy and outspoken Daniela, and ditzy, lovable Carla.
-   _OTMA_, a play that hypothetically explores the last days of the real daughters of Nicholas II, has the intelligent Olga, haughty Tatiana, sweet Marie, and mischievous tomboy Anastasia.
-   The titular _Marvelous Wonderettes_ are bossy and anxious Missy, flirtatious Cindy Lou, silly and childlike Suzy, and athletic Betty Jean.

    Video Games 

-   The nurses in the Sega brain trainer _Brain Assist_ seem to have this dynamic.
-   The four heroines of _Crystar_: Rei (the leader) is a Cool Big Sis admired by the others, Kokoro is sexy and flirty, Sen is serious and tomboyish, and Nanana is the sweet-naive ditz.
-   Normally, the three female party members in _Dragon Age: Origins_ comprise The Hecate Sisters ensemble, but with the DLC-only character Shale they become this: Leliana (sweet, naive), Shale (mannish snarker), Morrigan (sexy, cynical), and Wynne (wise, motherly).
-   _Dragon Age II_, assuming female Hawke: Merrill is the naive one, Aveline is mannish in the extreme, Isabela is over-the-top in her sexuality, and Hawke is the Only Sane Woman.
-   In the online game _Disney City Girl/City Girl Life_, the Player Character is a member of one of these, with the other three girls being her college friends who drop by frequently. Veronica aka V is the sexy one, Jenna is the Genki Girl, Olivia is the motherly and mature one, and since the PC is a Country Mouse she plays the role of the naive one.
-   _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_ (assuming you mod it to get the Handmaiden with a female player) has Visas (naiive), Mira (cynical/sexy), the Handmaiden (mannish), and the player (leader).
    -   Kreia could also fill the 'leader' mold, but in an extremely dark, twisted way as she manipulates the entire party to stick together.
-   Female members of your squad in _Mass Effect 2_ include Tali (Not really naive, but quite sweet), Jack (very mannish), Miranda (sexy, cynical), and Samara (wise, motherly). The addition of Liara as a Guest-Star Party Member and Kasumi in DLC mods throws off the dynamic a bit.
    -   Samara doesn't exactly fit the motherly part of that however, her Establishing Character Moment is coldly killing an opponent who was already down, and she threatens to murder the Player Character (among other people) several times over the course of the game. She's seen quite a bit, being an asari, so she's plenty wise. Just not very motherly.
-   _Persona_:
    -   _Persona 4_'s female party members are Yukiko (naive and sweet, though arguably more of a Genius Ditz), Chie (a definite Tomboy), Rise (sexy and outgoing) and Naoto (the smartest member and also The Comically Serious).
    -   In _Persona 5_, your female party members consist of four girls: Haru (sweet), Ann (sexy), Makoto (Team Mom), and Futaba (Tank-Top Tomboy hacker). The first three to join are also Blonde, Brunette, Redhead — Ann, Makoto, and Futaba respectively.
-   _Riviera: The Promised Land_ and its four Sprite heroines: Fia as Team Mom, Lina as the cute Genki Girl, Cierra as the ditzy but sexy older sister, and Serene as the Tomboy.
-   _Super Mario Bros._: Princess Peach is the naive one, being a total airhead who's repeatedly kidnapped, Princess Daisy is the tomboy, being gaming's de facto Tomboy Princess, Rosalina is the smart one, being aloof and motherly, and Pauline is the sexy one, being a business-savvy mayor and à singer who's a lot made-up.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   _Tales of Symphonia_:
        -   A sidequest involves a mother asking the party to find her four daughters within the city. The daughters are an obvious Shout-Out to the girls either from _Little Women_ or perhaps _Burst Angel_ - right down to their names and personalities (Jo will be impressed that you could tell she was a girl, regardless of if you really _could_).
        -   The female party members fit this trope as well; Raine is the wise motherly one, Colette is the sweet one, Sheena is the sexy one and Presea (despite having hints of Token Mini-Moe) is the tough one.
    -   _Tales of Vesperia_'s female party counts: Estelle (motherly), Rita (tomboyish), Judith (sexy), and Patty (childish).
-   In _Until Dawn_, the four female characters fit this: Jess (sex-crazed), Emily (snarky), Ashley (naive) and Sam (admirable).

    Visual Novels 

-   The employees at the diner (minus Veronica) in _Daughter for Dessert_: Lily is the sweet girl, Amanda is the snarky girl, Kathy is the sexy girl, and Heidi is the mature girl.
-   _Doki Doki Literature Club!_: Monika is the sexy one, being the most sociable and detail-oriented, Sayori is the naïve one, repeatedly being ditzy and not understanding what the others are talking about, Yuri is the smart one, being incredibly invested in her books and poetry skills, and Natsuki is the tomboy, being a tsundere who tends to act very vulgar. Though, starting with Sayori's suicide, the roles between Monika, Sayori, and Yuri tend to flip-flop.
-   The four girls who were chosen as the protagonist's sexual partners in _Double Homework_ form this: Amy is the sweet girl, Morgan is the snarky girl, Lauren is the sexy girl, and Rachel is the mature girl.
-   In ClockUp's Team Anise's _Eroge! ~Sex and Games Make Sexy Games~_, we have Nene (Sweet), Iori (Smart), Momoka (Sexy), and Kisara (Snarky).
-   In ClockUp's _Euphoria_, we have the four remaining female students, not counting the teacher: Rika (Sweet), Rinne (Smart), Kanae (Sexy), and Nemu (Snarky). In the Betty and Veronica Switch during the True Ending route, we also switch those roles between Nemu and Kanae.
-   In ClockUp's _ESEX Shikorsky: INTERNEET Security Cloud 2017_, we have Sharu (Sweet), Misesu (Sexy), Gachako (Snarky), and Amunesu (Smart).
-   For _Melody_, this can apply to all of the girls that the protagonist can end up with (Sophia and Xianne don’t count): Becca is the sweet girl, Melody is the snarky girl, Isabella is the sexy girl, and Amy is the mature girl.

    Web Animation 

-   _Homestar Runner's_ _Teen Girl Squad_ has Cheerleader as the pretty one (she's obsessed with fashion and boys), So and So as the smart one (she's a book-smart, self-proclaimed "Overachiever Bandit"), What's Her Face as the tomboy (she's always seen in a t-shirt and baggy jeans), and The Ugly One as the naïve one (she's a Cloudcuckoolander who is quick to follow any of Cheerleader's ridiculous ideas, such as jumping into a lion's mouth for a Secret Santa exchange, for the sake of popularity). The roles are blurred a bit, since What's Her Face tends to have more common sense than So and So (or any of the other girls, for that matter).
-   _Liv World_ features a Brainy Blonde, a clumsy tomboy, a fashion-savvy black girl, and a drama queen (is she hispanic or asian?).

    Webcomics

-   In _The March Family Letters_, a Setting Update of _Little Women_, Meg is the sensible Team Mom, Jo the Deadpan Snarker, Beth is the sweet/naive one and Amy is the flirty girly girl.
-   The girls of the original Team Kimba in the _Whateley Universe_: Generator as the sweet and naive one, Fey as the sexy one, Phase as the mannish (and how) Deadpan Snarker, and Tennyo as the Cool Big Sis type.
-   _Kittisaurus_: The four female cats; Chuchu (sweet and childlike, prior to her nasal surgery), Lala (the pretty one liked by all the male cats- except Dodo), TT (the gruff action girl although she will occasionally slip into the mother role), and Nana who is literally a mother cat and extends this role to the adult cats (namely Lulu) as well as her kittens.

    Western Animation 

-   _Archer_: Cheryl is The Ditz, Pam is the snarky Brawn Hilda, Lana is the Ms. Fanservice, and Malory, while not an admirable character, is the oldest and The Leader.
-   On _Gravity Falls_, whenever Mabel, Candy, Grenda and Wendy interact with or work together, such as in "The Last Mabelcorn", they fit this trope perfectly. Mabel is a very girly, wannabe-Fille Fatale who loves glitter and cute things (a pretty one), Candy is a mousy Shrinking Violet (a sweet-naïve one), Grenda is a loud and aggressive Brawn Hilda type who loves breaking things (a tomboyish one), and Wendy is the protective older one who acts as a Cool Big Sis to the other girls.
-   _Hey Arnold!_: Lila is the sweet, innocent one, Helga is the tomboy, Rhonda is the glamour-obsessed pretty one, and Phoebe is the smart one.
-   In _Jem_, the band Jem And The Holograms consists of the teenager Kimber, the tomboyish and blunt Aja, the Dude Magnet Jem, and the shy fashion designer Shana. They later get a Sixth Ranger in Raya. Jem also counts as "dependable" but mostly when she is her alter ego Jerrica, and Kimber is the most prone to love interests.
-   _Josie and the Pussycats_ has this when including Alexandra. Melody is a Dumb Blonde, Alexandra is rich and glamorous, and Josie and Valerie kind of trade off the smart and tomboyish roles Depending on the Writer.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ has the alicorns (as of season 4 and beyond): Luna (naive), Twilight Sparkle (snarky), Cadence (glamorous), Celestia (Team Mom).
-   _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_ have this in episodes where Princess Morbucks appears. Blossom is the smart one, Bubbles the sweetie, Buttercup the tomboy, and Princess the Alpha Bitch.
-   _The Proud Family_ has vain Alpha Bitch Lacienega (a sexy one), loud and aggressively flirtacious Sassy Black Girl Dijonay (a tomboyish one), sweet and impressionable Shrinking Violet Zoey (a sweet-naive one) who's constantly caving into peer pressure by the aforementioned girls, and Penny, the caring and polite Nice Girl title character who tries to keep the peace.
-   _Recess_ gives us the Ashleys. Blonde leader Ashley A., African-American and glamorous Ashley B., athletic Fiery Redhead Ashley Q., and Hispanic and quiet Ashley T.
-   _Sky Dancers_ brought us Camille (the creative black girl), Jade (the asian ballerina), Angelica (the tomboy teenie-bopper) and Skyla (the wise platinum-blonde leader of the team).
-   _Steven Universe_:
    -   Playing this trope straight, the original Crystal Gems, from when Rose Quartz (Steven's mom) was still alive. Garnet's role was more or less the same as currently - the cool-headed, confident one. However, since Rose took the role of the Team Mom and the mentor, Amethyst and Pearl's roles differ from what we see in the series present They fit, respectively, the childish, naïve one and the smart, elegant one. Note that Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl's core traits remained but their more prominent features shifted to accommodate the fact they now are raising (and protecting) a child.
    -   Also played straight with the Great Diamond Authority from when Pink Diamond was still alive. Yellow Diamond is very assertive, strict, and overall, an even mix of the Lad-ette (just with less vulgarity, but rude nonetheless) and the Prince Charming tomboy (mainly towards Blue Diamond). In turn, Blue Diamond herself is much more feminine in contrast to Yellow Diamond. Blue Diamond is also soft-spoken, diplomatic, motherly (towards Pink Diamond), and sociable. White Diamond occupies the role of the reachableLeader, but in an even more demanding-from-her-subordinates, overachiever flavor. Finally, because she is the youngest of the quartet, Pink Diamond was clumsy in regards to her duties, a goofball, a spoiled brat sometimes, and the Tag Along Kid.
    -   When Pink Diamond died, Character Development kicked in and the Great Diamond Authority stopped fitting this trope and the Diamonds' roles shifted. White Diamond took a level in aloofness and in her god-complex, overcompensating in her search for perfection. Blue retreated from Gem society into a depressed, impulsive, and overly-emotional shell of her former self. Yellow, in turn, became harsher, more hot-heated, more ruthless, and less rational. It's worth noting, Pink Diamond also evolved as a character before dying because she fell in love with Earth and its freedom and assumed her Rose Quartz persona, thus not really dying.
-   _Total Drama_: In the season, _Pahkitew Island_, on Team Kinosewak: Scarlett (the smart and quiet one), Jasmine (the fearless tomboy), Amy (the self-centered Alpha Bitch) and Samey/Sammy (the sweet, shy and naïve one).
-   _Winx Club_ gives us Musa, Stella, Flora and Tecna working without Bloom temporarily in season 1, giving us a temporary four-girl ensemble. Stella qualifies as the sexy one and The Ditz, Flora is the Team Mom, Musa is the tomboyish one and Tecna is the smart one.

    Real Life 

-   The four English wives of Henry VIII are a downplayed version of this trope, at least in how they're remembered; Anne Boleyn wasn't _quite_ a tomboy, but she was quite fiery and outspoken, Jane Seymour was the shy and submissive "good girl", whom Henry was buried next to (sweet), Catherine Howard was beheaded for her promiscuity (pretty), and the maternal Catherine Parr was known for her literacy and education, as well as her influence on the future Queen Elizabeth I (admirable).
