**Tifa:** Hey, let's make a promise. Umm... if you get really famous... and if I'm ever in a bind... you'll come save me, all right?  
**Cloud:** What?  
**Tifa:** If I'm ever in trouble, my hero will come and rescue me. I want to experience that at least once.  
**Cloud:** What?  
**Tifa:** Come on! Promise me!  
**Cloud:** All right... I promise.

A dramatically-made promise that serves as foreshadowing. The promise will eventually be called in and action will be required.

Whether they succeed, fail or refuse to keep their promise depends almost entirely on the idealism-level of the story. Other factors, such as whether they were told what they had to do, or if it was a Leonine Contract, may come into play. Even Releasing from the Promise is usually a scene of high drama.

Compare Inevitably Broken Rule and Rash Promise, which often overlaps with this trope.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   The premise of _Asteroid in Love_ is based on a promise Mira and Ao made as children: explore the heavens and eventually get a star named after Ao.
-   This is basically the trope that sets in motion Mashiro's persistence to become a mangaka in _Bakuman。_. A promise made in Chapter 1 between him and Azuki,that when he and Takagi get an anime from their manga and Azuki voice-acts the heroine, she and Mashiro will get married.
-   Utena invokes The Promise in her vow to save Anthy in _Revolutionary Girl Utena_. Even when she ultimately fails, her valiant attempt leads to Anthy freeing herself to go in search of her fallen hero(ine).
-   _Bleach_:
    -   In the Soul Society arc, Ichigo _will_ save Rukia... whether she likes it or not.
    -   During the Arrancar Arc, Ichigo vows to Orihime that "next time... I'll definitely protect you!" Later, he tells her "Don't worry. I'm definitely going to win." This promise is so strong that when Ulquiorra brings him to the verge of death, he is resurrected as an insanely powerful hollow obsessed with protecting Orihime — and _only_ Orihime.
-   _Blood+:_ Saya makes Haji promise to kill her after she defeats Diva, a promise which he is unable to keep, instead encouraging her to live.
-   _Chrono Crusade_ has several promises that the main characters take very seriously. The first is that Mary Magdalene made Chrono promise to "live", which is implied to be the only reason he didn't commit suicide after her death. Also, the manga version shows Joshua and Rosette promise as children to "grow-up together" — remembering his promise is what gives Joshua the strength to reject Chrono's horns. Also, when Rosette made her contract with Chrono, Chrono seems to have promised _himself_ that he would protect her, even going to the point of saying he promised to "never make her cry" in the manga. When he's forced to break this promise at one point, he becomes really pissed.
-   _Code Geass_ has several. A couple of them are found on the Pinky Swear page and are explained in more detail there. A non-pinky promise comes when Lelouch realizes how much his friends care about him, he tearfully promises them that he'll set off fireworks with them again someday. He doesn't, and when he realises he won't be able to keep this promise, he calls them to apologize and say goodbye.
-   In _Digimon Adventure 02_, Ken promises to Wormmon that he won't betray his essential nature — in essence, that he'll stay kind and gentle — when he first meets him as a child. Flash-forward to a few years, More than Mind Control, and some heavy psychological trauma later, and he's the Digimon Kaiser. He does eventually keep his promise, though. Kinda.
-   _Dr. STONE reboot: Byakuya_: Byakuya promises Rei, the robot he built, that he will return to the space station one day, and Rei promises to keep the station intact. On Byakuya's side, this was an Empty Promise; he knew the station would de-orbit in a year, and even if it didn't it was extremely unlikely he'd ever be able to return to space. Rei, on the other hand, doesn't know any of that, and does everything it can to keep the station intact. It harvests nearby asteroids and comets to maintain the station, upgrades itself hundreds of times, builds a fleet of nuclear missiles to stop an asteroid impact that would wipe out all life on Earth, and sees nothing wrong with waiting **3700 years** for Byakuya to return. Throughout it all, it keeps a massive strobe light bright enough to be seen from the ground, so that Byakuya will know it's still waiting. When Rei turns it on for the first time, it's the last thing that Byakuya sees before he dies.
-   _Elfen Lied_ plays around with this in the scene where the villainous Bando, rescued by Mayu earlier in the series and feeling indebted, promises to save her once if she winds in trouble. Mayu is forced to cash in this promise not even a minute later, when _Bando himself attacks her._
    -   But when she calls for his help again, he shows up in minutes and knocks the stuffing out of the man sexually assaulting her.
    -   A second example is Kouta promising to meet Lucy back at the stone on the last day of the festival.
-   _Fairy Tail_: When he was a child, Sting Eucliffe promised his Exceed companion Lector that he would defeat the "Salamander" (Natsu Dragneel), because Lector was being bullied by others for saying Sting killed a dragon. When he finally meets Natsu years later and faces off against him in the Grand Magic Games, he and Rogue find themselves on the wrong end of a Curb-Stomp Battle, and he mentally apologizes to Lector as he falls in defeat, as Natsu is too strong for him.
-   In _Gate 7_, Hana is waiting for someone who has not been revealed yet and once they are reunited, they will keep their promise.
-   _Get Backers:_ Ban promised Yamato that he would protect Himiko from her curse, and Juubei promised to stop Kazuki if he ever strayed "from the path of righteousness."
-   _I Want to Eat Your Pancreas_: The protagonist makes Sakura promise to tell him when she'll die, and promises in return to return her copy of _The Little Prince_. Both promises are broken when Sakura is murdered.
-   During the early stages of _Kaitou Saint Tail_, Asuka Jr. extracts a promise from Saint Tail that 1) she'll always send a Calling Card to let him know when she goes on a heist and 2) she won't let anyone catch her before he does. At this point, they're only on Worthy Opponent terms with some subtext, but she ends up keeping the promise so diligently that he can even tell that she's being framed if she doesn't send him a calling card. At the end of the series, after Saint Tail is revealed to have been his own girlfriend Meimi, Maju attempts to mock one of Saint Tail's cards by calling it a "love letter", getting him to realize that _all of them were like that_; while he'd been spending the last half of the series trying to figure out what Meimi thought of him, she'd been sticking to that promise as a way of conveying that she wanted him to be happy and only trusted him to be the one to catch (at this point redefined to mean "protect") her. He makes do on his side of the bargain by literally catching her in midair, and during the Distant Finale, Seira refers to their "eternal promise" as originating from it, making the entire thing into an allegory for their ability to communicate with and trust each other.
-   In _Land of the Lustrous_, Phosphylite resolves to find a job for Cinnabar that is entertaining and exclusive only to the latter Lustrous. The promise comes back once every arc, barely remembered and more muddy the more Phos grows.
-   Keitaro holds strongly to his 15-year-old promise to get into Tokyo University for/with a nearly-forgotten girl in _Love Hina_. He also made a similar promise to forever be with his adoptive sister, which she does indeed dramatically call him on in the OVA sequel, _Love Hina Again_. The concept of promises also is the main theme of the episode about the Robot Girl Moe.
-   _Madlax_ has Madlax and Vanessa promising each other to survive. It looks like Vanessa fails, but along comes Margaret ex machina...
-   And also included in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_. After Signum beats Zest and gives him an honorable death, Agito prompts Signum to watch over her and see if Signum can really follow up Zest's last wishes and his ideals. Signum's response? "If you ever see me straying from that direction, kill me." More proof that Signum is a magnificent Expy of Lamia.
-   _Nabari no Ou:_ Miharu's promise to Yoite, made under duress, to erase Yoite's existence once Miharu can use the Sinrabanshou becomes the main tension and plotline of the series, as well as a source of a lot of its angst.
-   _Naruto_ is full of "promises of a lifetime"... some more successfully fulfilled than others. The most notable case is Naruto's promise to Sakura in Part I, to return Sasuke for her. The episode after the mission to do this was actually called "The Promise That Could Not Be Kept." Although, after Sakura's infamous fake love confession — which Naruto easily sees right through, calls her out on for her dishonesty, and rejects outright — he renews his promise not for her anymore, but for his own reasons. It's still his most important reason to fight, alongside protecting his friends.
    -   Another plot relevant promise is Sasuke promising to avenge his family by killing his brother. Once he succeeds he instantly makes a new one: Destroying Konoha. Obviously that guy needs someone to kill.
    -   Kakashi promised Obito that he would look after Rin. It would seem he failed. The Not Quite Dead Obito witnesses Kakashi actually killing Rin, contributing to his change into Tobi.
-   In _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, Negi promises Ako that he will win the tournament. At about the ten second count, he recalls the promise and gets up to face Rakan once more. It's actually at tie and Rakan _could_ have beaten him if he really wanted to. But considering the shape Negi was in? Badass.
-   In _Noir_, much drama is derived from Mireille's ill-considered promise to kill Kirika once she learns the nature of their past connection — by the time that occurs, the emotional bond between the two of them is so strong, Mireille finds herself unable to pull the trigger, even though Kirika turns to have been single-handedly responsible for everything bad that has ever happened in Mireille's life and actually _begs_ Mireille to kill her, unable to live with the guilt.
-   _Noragami_: Hiyori vows to stray god Yato that she will never forget him.
-   In _One Piece_, a band of pirates left a baby whale they adopted named Laboon at the beginning of the Grand Line, promising to return after they've made the round-world voyage. Unfortunately, those pirates were wiped out, half becoming ill and having to leave the ship to save the rest, and those that remained were wiped out in a battle. Of those pirates, only Brook remains, having been brought back to life as a skeleton by his Devil Fruit. And now he has promised to his dead crewmates to deliver the final message of the Rumbar Pirates to Laboon, even after fifty years.
    -   When the Straw Hat crew first met Laboon, the whale was battering himself to death on the Red Line out of despair of the unfulfilled promise, prompting Luffy to make a new one. He gets into a fight with Laboon which he declares a draw, stating they will have to have a rematch when he returns. Further, he paints his logo on Laboon's head as a mark of the promise, which would be erased if Laboon returned to hammering at the Red Line.
    -   During their childhood, Luffy and Ace made one promise to each other after the (supposed) death of their third brother Sabo: they would live their lives free of regrets. As Ace laid dying in Luffy's arms, he stated that the only regret he had was that he wouldn't be able to see Luffy become the Pirate King. This promise is one of the major reasons why Luffy was able to move on from Ace's death and continue following his dream.
    -   Ace also made another promise to Luffy after the above event: that he would never die and leave Luffy alone. While Ace ultimately couldn't fulfill the first part of his promise, unbeknownst to both of them at the time, he _didn't_ leave Luffy alone. Sabo still lived, and made his own promise on Ace's grave: to succeed Ace as the user of the Mera Mera no Mi and Luffy's protector — both of which he manages splendidly.
    -   Luffy and Zoro's goals can be seen as promises to Shanks and Kuina respectively.
-   In _Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew_, when Ash tries to console Lucario after it believes it was abandoned and asks if he can help, it only wants him to do one thing: Promise he will _never_ abandon Pikachu. Ash swears he will not.
-   In _Ranma ½_, these promises cropping up out of nowhere are common plot elements — Ukyo has at least two with Ranma, Kodachi has one with her rival Asuka, and Ranma has several that he doesn't even know about until they're called.
-   _Reborn! (2004)_: Squalo promised 8 years ago to Xanxus that he will never cut his hair until Xanxus becomes the boss of Vongola. And he did, for eighteen years into the alternate future from the Ten Years Bazooka. Obviously because Xanxus doesn't have the blood of Vongola, thus it's impossible for him to become Boss.
-   Fitoria from _The Rising of the Shield Hero_ makes **very damn certain** of this, regardless of the measures needed to ensure it happens, especially if it involves killing all four of the Cardinal Heroes in order to summon another "Chosen Few" that will work better if need be (three of which are already beyond pathetic when it comes to "working together, not making complete asses of themselves and being unbelievably appalling in letting others manipulate them with sheer ease") All of this she made to a Hero from ages long past, someone she doesn't even specifically recall, the only thing she remembers is how memorable/nice he was to her, among other things that she still keeps her promise **firmly** to come the time of the current Cardinal Heroes comprised of Ren, Itsuki, Motoyasu, but most important of all... Naofumi. The promise was to ensure all four Cardinal Heroes work together to defeat the Waves, no matter the situation, but even then she recalls a horrific event that she says will occur which will force the Cardinal Heroes to decide which they fight for: The World, or its People, the latter being a **very** thorny path...
-   In _The Secret Agreement_, Iori tells Yuuichi that he loves him more than anything and would sacrifice anything for him. This is perfectly romantic until Kyuusai reveals to Yuuichi that he is born to steal life-energy and that his destined prey, under the delusion of love, will naturally offer his life for him to take.
-   Both Lottie and Sara in _Str.A.In.: Strategic Armored Infantry_ promised to become Reasoners and see their brothers again. One brother kills the other before either can reunite.
-   _Super Robot Wars: Original Generation_ has this: Kyosuke made a promise to Lamia that he'd kill her if she ever loses her mind ("If you ever lose your mind, don't worry. I'll destroy you myself"). He did get his time to try and fulfill it when he rescued her from the Bartoll. He succeeded in the OAV, but horribly failed in OG Gaiden, and later has to leave it to Axel to actually rescue her and restore her mind.
-   In _Tiger & Bunny_, Kotetsu made a promise to his wife on her deathbed to continue to be a Hero after she was gone. This promise starts getting harder and harder to keep once Kotetsu starts losing his powers.
-   _Vandread_'s Hibiki made the casual promise to come to Dita's room. Though hardly a big thing to promise, this haunts him throughout the entire second season.
-   _Variable Geo_: In Episode 1, Yuka nearly concedes defeat to Jun until her friend, Satomi, reminds Yuka of their vow. Yuka then remembers that she and Satomi promised that neither of them would allow themselves to lose until they had the chance to settle their rivalry in the VG Tournament. Yuka renews her commitment to Satomi and defeats Jun.
-   _Your Lie in April_: Kaori makes a promise to Kousei to perform together once again, which drives her determination to undergo a high-risk surgery. She fails to keep it, because later it's revealed that either the surgery failed or she died during it.
-   In the Battle City arc of _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, Jounouchi's/Joey's major motivation is his promise to duel with Yugi and get back his Red-Eyes Black Dragon card.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_: At the last second in Season 3, it is revealed that in their past life together, Juudai promised that he would love only Yubel forever. This became the driving force of her motivation when she returned in Season 3. While Yubel _can_ alter people's memories, it's impossible that she was doing so here, as she had nothing to do with Juudai regaining his memories, and wasn't even aware that he had. Him fusing their souls together has the double purpose of confirming that their past was true (as he would have learned about a lie) and reaffirming that he loved her.

    Ballads 

-   In the Child Ballad "The Lord of Lorn and the False Steward":
    
    -   The steward promises to protect the young lord on his journeys, and promptly becomes The Oath-Breaker.
    
    _"If I be not true to my master," he said,  
    "Christ himselfe be not trew to mee!  
    If I be not true to my lord and master,  
    An ill death that I may die!"_
    
    -   The young lord saves his life by promising to never tell anyone about the steward's having attacked and robbed him. (He gets around this through Exact Words.)
    -   The duke's daughter the steward was wooing pretending to be the young lord, on learning the truth, promises to marry no one but the true lord.
    
    _"If you doe not my councell keepe,  
    That I haue told you with good intent,  
    And if you doe it not well keepe,  
    Ffarwell! my life is at an ende."  
    "I wilbe true to thee, Lord of Learne,  
    Or else Christ be not soe vnto me;  
    And as I am a trew ladye,  
    I'le neuer marry none but thee."_
    

    Comic Books 

-   _Grendel_: The Grendel oath acts as this. Virtually every character to recite it is doomed to die a horrible death, often at the cost to all he loves and cherishes. Sometimes, this is due to failing the Grendel ideals. Other times, this is the culmination of following it.
-   In _The Man_, John is able to hide The Man in a small "secrets" cupboard in his bedside table, because his mother has promised never to look there.
-   _Monica's Gang_: In "Deus Cebola", Jimmy has gained godly powers after climbing the Stairs to Heaven and needs to be brought back to Earth. Smudge ties a rope around his waist and asks Angel to pull him back when he asks, before climbing the Stairs to retrieve his friend. After the mission is accomplished, Smudge is revealed to actually be Satan in disguise, who wanted to prevent the birth of another god. The evil entity begs Angel to pull the rope before the heavenly forces purify him, and the protagonist, after much deliberation, complies, saying that, as much as he would have liked his biggest enemy to be defeated, fulfilling a promise is what differentiates angels from demons.
-   In _2008 storyline_ _Way of the World_, Supergirl promises a boy who is dying from cancer that he will not die. She will not allow it. She moves Heaven and Earth to find a cure in time but at the end, she fails.
-   _Usagi Yojimbo_:
    -   In _A Promise In the Snow_, Usagi promises a young girl her gravely wounded father won't die. After they're all nearly buried by an avalanche and Usagi has been battered unconscious, the girl invokes Usagi's promise to get him back on his feet.
    -   Another short story has Usagi apologize for taking so long to return a masterful origami to the man who made it for him. He'd intended to hand it back immediately, but they were quickly embroiled in a battle. The other person didn't survive it. Usagi is returning it to his grave.

    Fairy Tales 

-   In "Bearskin", the hero, appalling shaggy, filthy and ragged, but rich, rescues a man from financial distress, the man promises that he may marry one of his daughters. Only the youngest is willing. However, his appearance stemmed from a Deal with the Devil, and that being over, he cleans up nicely and formally arrives at their house as a wooer — or, in some variants, at his own wedding. The older sisters are impressed, but the youngest, being the sort who would marry a hideous man to redeem her father's promise, ignores him until he proves that handsome as he is, he is still the same man whom she promised to marry.
-   In "The Frog Prince", the king insists the princess must keep her promise to the frog who helped her.

-   In "East of the Sun, West of the Moon", the bear lets the heroine go home as long as she promises not to speak with her mother alone. When she breaks this, her mother incites her to look at him at night, which means that magic snatches him away, and she must search all over the world for him.
-   In "Parsley", when the ogress catches the mother in her garden, she makes her promise to give up her child. When the girl is about seven, the ogress tells her, repeatedly, to remind her mother of the promise.
    
    _Every time she went along the street and met the ogress the old woman said to her, "Tell your mother to remember her promise." And she went on repeating this message so often that the poor mother, having no longer patience to listen to the refrain, said one day to Parsley, "If you meet the old woman as usual, and she reminds you of the hateful promise, answer her, 'Take it.'"_

She falls in love with the human who finds her, and agrees to marry him, on the condition that he not peek at her while she bathes. They are Happily Married for awhile, raising several children (all of whom are more like demons or demigods, depending on whom you ask), and settling into a nice chateau. Buut, one day, her hubby's curiosity and/or lust gets the better of him, and he peeks in on her bathtime, and finds out that she's actually a mermaid. (He sees her tail fin.) Melusine is _not_ happy, to say the least.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: San promises Vivienne that he'll see they escape the place where Alan Jonah has imprisoned them, together. Vivienne promises San that she'll never leave him. Both those promises get tested and are ultimately kept, the latter in particular during the main fic's Darkest Hour chapter.
-   _A Crown of Stars_: Shinji makes two promises to Asuka:
    -   Shinji promises Asuka that he will NEVER abandon her when she needs his help, no matter what.
        
        **Shinji**: I... even if it had been futile, I should have tried. I can’t abandon you like that again, Asuka. So I won’t. Ever.  
        **Asuka**: Do you swear, Third? \[…\] You’ve got my back, no matter what?  
        **Shinji**: Y-yes. I swear. No matter what.
        
    -   And several chapters later she asked him to make her another promise: Never leave her.
        
        **Asuka**: Can you promise me you’ll always be there, Shinji? Promise me you’ll never leave me again?
        
-   _Advice and Trust_:
    -   After getting together Shinji promises Asuka:
        
        _"As long as you'll have me, I promise, \[...\] Together, forever and always."_
        
    -   And in return Asuka promised:
        
        _"Until the end of the world, you and me, against Angels and anything else that tries to hurt us."_
        
-   _A Pikachu in Love_: Pikachu makes several of these over the course of the fic. One is to meet Pichi again the next night, another one is to Misty, to never leave her or his friends behind, and to always come back to them no matter what, and one final one to Pichi as they say their goodbyes...
    
    _"<Just promise me that you won’t forget me... And... if you ever end your journey or if you and your trainer go separate ways, will you look for me? Will you still love me and come for me then? Even if it’s years away...?>"_
    
    _"<I will. I promise it.>"_
    
-   _The Child of Love_:
    -   After getting together Shinji promises never leaving Asuka and their child if Asuka promises will not give up her life anymore.
        
        **Asuka**: _\[softly, in Shinji's ear\]_ Shinji?  
        **Shinji**: _\[softly, in Asuka's ear\]_ What is it?  
        **Asuka**: You'd never leave us, would you?  
        _Short pause._  
        **Shinji**: I promise you, right here and now, that I'll NEVER leave you two...on one condition.  
        **Asuka**: Which is?  
        **Shinji**: You must promise me you won't give up your life anymore like you tried to a few days ago. You're the two most precious things I have on this earth. I can't afford to lose either one of you. You or Teri. So, please, don't ever do that again. I'm sorry if I was rude to you after that, but I really didn't know how to handle it. I mean...  
        **Asuka**: _\[smiling\]_ Don't worry. For Teri's sake, I won't do that again! Deal?  
        **Shinji**: _\[now smiling, too\]_ Deal.
        
    -   In chapter 6 she asks Shinji making an additional promise:
        
        **Asuka**: Well, then, how about another promise?  
        **Shinji**: Hey! I'll have to write these all down on a piece of paper or I'll forget them all!  
        _The two burst out laughing._  
        **Asuka**: _\[giggling\]_ May God protect us on the battlefield! Neither one of us is gonna die in battle, okay? For each other's sake! And for Teri's!  
        **Shinji**: _\[cheerfully\]_ Yeah! And I swear that I'll protect you if anything happens!  
        **Asuka**: _\[giggling\]_ And I'll do the same for you, too, I swear!  
        **Shinji**: Deal!  
        **Asuka**: Deal! Let's celebrate that with a drink!
        
-   _Evangelion 303_: In chapter 14 Shinji pops the question, and Asuka answers she will only accept that engagement ring if he can promise he'll love her and be faithful to her for as long as he lives:
    
    **Asuka**: IF you REALLY want to tie yourself down to that for the rest of your life... IF you can really PROMISE to be true to that— true to ME— for as long as you live... Then I will... accept this.  
    **Shinji**: I promise. Asuka.  
    **Asuka**: Think about it— That's a long time! Can you imagine keeping a promise for sixty or seventy more years!  
    **Shinji**: YES, I promise!  
    **Asuka**: And if you should waiver in the slightest...  
    **Shinji**: I know! I know! I really do promise, Asuka!  
    **Asuka**: _\[blushing\]_ ... You're either a fool... or a liar. And I don't think you are a liar.
    
-   In _Ghosts of Evangelion_ Shinji makes Asuka two promises: he'll take care of her and he will not abandon their daughter.
-   In _Hellsister Trilogy_, Supergirl promises her evil duplicate Satan Girl to help her find her baby if she stops fighting. Satan Girl tells her to shove it.
    
    But my child is still alive... I can sense that. I just do not know where he is.  
    **Supergirl:** You won't believe this, but I'm sorry. On my honor, I am. And if you will swear to stop this battle, I will help you search for your child. That is my promise.  
    **Satan Girl:** Ohhhhh, don't you wish, Lightsister. I can find my child. After our war, I will find him. Or her. There is nothing left to us now, except the fight.

    “I would not fear that Asuka, for I promise you I shall always return to you,” Shinji reassures her.  
    “You can’t promise that. No one can promise that,” she says morosely.  
    “Remember that one of the selling points of_ Chaos _is no angst and crap. I can promise you this Asuka that I will return from anything if it is to be back with you. If you should find my body broken and dead, then to whatever hell my soul travels I will find my way back to you,” Shinji tells her._

-   In _Farscape_:

This is a promise Ned keeps until his last breath as he spends the rest of his life protecting Jon, raising and loving him as his own son at Winterfell, and passes his nephew off as his own illegitimate child to keep Jon safe from their family's enemies and Robert Baratheon, who would pose a fatal threat to Jon if Jon's biological parentage ever came to light.

    Theatre 

-   _Westeros: An American Musical_: In "Hand-Holding", Eddard explains that his part in letting himself and his Old Friend Robert drift apart over the years was a secret he couldn't share with Robert. One of the few details he gives about the secret is that it involved making a promise to someone. The play ends long before the point where the nature of the promise was revealed in one of the canon versions of the story (it's only been hinted at in the other), but its nature would have indeed made it hard for Eddard to keep it all while staying in regular contact with Robert.

    Video Games 

-   In _Atelier Escha & Logy: Alchemists of the Dusk Sky_, the final boss, Flameu, once made a promise with Clone, a very important promise. While Clone planted trees, she would find out why the earth was withering and would return. Then, once she knew, she would come back and they would enjoy apples together. But things went wrong and she ended up being in the Unexplored Ruins for hundreds of years.
-   One of the story paths in _BlazBlue_ had Bang Shishigami who was at first being seen as an annoying Stalker with a Crush by Litchi Faye-Ling, until he jumped in and saved both her and Arakune from Hakumen. Bang opts to do a Heroic Sacrifice while Litchi escapes; and asks to meet her in a bar when it's all over, and Litchi promised to do so. Unfortunately, it's a Heroic Sacrifice for real; Bang presumably dies and we don't know if Litchi even remembered him and The Promise. The Kaka clan, however, made him a posthumous hero.
    -   _Continuum Shift_, however, uses a variation. Litchi still made the promise and Bang actually survived. While they didn't exactly meet in a bar, it is clear that from that point on, Litchi grew to respect Bang tremendously and treats him with kindness and compassion.
    -   Litchi herself has a very dramatic version that influences her actions. She made a promise that she will save her colleague Lotte Carmine, who is now Arakune, no matter what happens to her. Unfortunately, fulfilling this promise is a hard thing to do since it involves corrupting herself to the Boundary to the point she's getting very near to become another Arakune, she had to take the offer of someone Obviously Evil like Hazama to join NOL and becoming a 'bad guy' in general and eventually helping Relius Clover in his plan to exterminate all life and create a new world where Lotte can be prevented from becoming Arakune, all of these fill her with a huge dose of remorse, but she feels obliged to follow through to the end, even if she could be happy enough by leaving him alone, and especially even if other people consider her stupid for trying to save someone they think is 'beyond saving' and wouldn't bother.
    -   Perhaps hilariously, even Relius Clover joins in the act in _Chronophantasma_. He goaded his son Carl to his side by first having Litchi on his clutches 'on her own will' (see above) and the promise that he will restore Ada, Carl's biggest goal in life for the moment. Considering Relius didn't break a sweat in putting him down, when Carl actually did on his own will, we all know that Relius would make it an Empty Promise. But... then he saw Bang Shishigami thwart his magnum opus of a plot despite having both Litchi and Carl, who Bang liked very much, as his pawns, and then he's dumped by the Imperator (revealed by Izanami) to 'die' and with him being The Perfectionist, Relius fell into a Villainous BSoD and is railroaded to commit himself to Carl's previous promise to restore Ada before he could die, which he accepts because he got nothing else to look forward into.
-   _Brave Hero Yuusha_: Edward makes a promise to protect Ashlyn that drives him from that point onward.
-   In _Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow_, Soma Cruz asks Julius Belmont to promise to kill him if he turns evil. Thankfully, the person making the promise is reliable and more than strong enough to fulfil said promise if it comes to that. In the bad ending, Julius turns up in the throne room to kill Soma, and in Julius Mode in _Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow_, Julius gets Yoko and Alucard's help to take down Soma.
    
    **Soma:** ... I've got a favour to ask of you.  
    **Julius:** What is it?  
    **Soma:** From here. I will set off to fight against my own fate. If I lose the battle... And I become reincarnation of evil, I want you to kill me.
    
    **Julius:** ... I will... I promise.  
    **Soma:** Thanks. Now I can go into this battle without reservations.  
    **Julius:** Farewell, my friend. Don't let me use that whip again.
    
-   In the beginning of _Demonheart_, Orchid asks the player to promise she will love and protect her unborn son. Later, the player has an option to fulfill this promise or break it. There is also a possibility to give your word to Ari that you will not hurt Rivera, and to subsequently betray her.
-   A promise is the driving force behind the plot of _Disgaea 4_, hence the title. The main character, Valvatorez made a promise to give his Prinny trainees a sardine once they finish their training. However, the Netherworld's government decides that all of the Prinnies need to be exterminated to cut back on expenses, which would keep him from fulfilling his promise. So naturally, he decides to overthrow the government.
-   _Dragon Quest VIII_: Trodain promised Argonia that their kingdoms would be united by an Arranged Marriage. Unfortunately, Argonia's Prince is Prince Charmles, which causes King Trode no small amount of grief after meeting him and seeing what an utter boor he'd promised his daughter's hand to. In both endings, he decides Screw The Promise, I'm Doing What's Best For Medea and fights to stop the ceremony — the Golden Ending also lets him Take a Third Option and let her marry Charmles' just-discovered cousin. Plus, it's implied that 'The Hero' had the right of succession anyway.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   _Final Fantasy VII_ has Cloud's childhood promise to Tifa that he would protect her if she ever got into trouble (see page quote).
    -   _Final Fantasy VIII_:
        -   The game has the iconic promise between Squall and Rinoa.
            
            **Squall:** "How about this... I'll be here..."
            
            **Rinoa:** "...Why?"
            
            **Squall:** "The reason why you couldn't find me was because we haven't promised yet."
            
            **Rinoa:** "Promised...?"
            
            **Squall:** "I'll be waiting for you. If you come here, you'll find me. I promise."
            
            **Rinoa:** "I'll be here, too. It's a promise! Thanks Squall! Next time, we'll meet for sure!"
            
        -   In the ending FMV when Squall is lost in Time Compression, Rinoa manages to find him and bring him back to the location of the promise.
    -   The main musical theme of _Final Fantasy XIII_ is actually called "Final Fantasy XIII — The Promise." The talk page for the song on the _Final Fantasy_ Wiki lists at least five different promises within the game: Snow promised to protect and save Serah, Snow and Vanille both promised to protect and save Cocoon, Vanille claimed that she promised Hope they would visit Gran Pulse together, Fang promised to protect Vanille and not let her turn into a C'ieth and Hope promised to watch out for Lightning.
        
        **Vanille**: Wishes aren't enough. Prayers either. This time, I'm making a promise. I will keep Cocoon safe. I promise, no matter what.
        
-   _Halo_:
    -   When Chief is forced to leave behind Cortana near the end of _Halo 2_, this exchange occurs:
        
        **Master Chief**: After I'm through with Truth...  
        **Cortana**: Don't make a girl a promise... if you know you can't keep it...
        
    -   Which leads to this in the third game:
        
        **Cortana**: You found me. But so much of me is wrong... out of place... you might be too late...  
        **Master Chief**: You know me. When I make a promise...  
        **Cortana**: ...You... keep it. ...I _do_ know how to pick 'em...  
        **Master Chief**: Lucky me.
        
    -   In _Halo 4_, as Cortana is dying from rampancy, Chief reminds her of his promise to keep her safe. Cortana simply asks Chief what will happen to _him_ if he can't keep his promise. As it turns out, Cortana ends up sacrificing herself to save Chief, which absolutely devastates him; he's still reeling from her death even when we see him again in _Halo 5: Guardians_.
-   In _Hatoful Boyfriend_, the entire Bad Boys Love route and storyline hinges on the fulfillment of a promise from long ago. Given the premise of the game, you might think that it's going to be along the lines of a Childhood Marriage Promise, but it...really, _really_ isn't.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_:
    -   At the end of _Kingdom Hearts_, Sora makes a promise with Kairi that he'll return to her and the island with Riku someday.
    -   In a deliberate echo in _Kingdom Hearts II_, Roxas makes a promise that he'll meet up again with his friends in Twilight Town. Sora fulfills it vicariously for him, and gets the Oathkeeper keyblade for doing so.
    -   Most of Sora's story in _Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories_ is based on the promise that he and Riku both supposedly made to Naminé on a shooting star to protect her. But the promise is fake and so is Riku: Naminé herself implanted the promise both of their memories and the Riku is actually a replica of the real Riku. Even after they both know the truth, though, they still vow to protect her. At the end of the game, Sora makes a new promise to Naminé - that when he wakes up, they'll find each other and be friends for real. She warns him that he'll forget the promise, but he says that even if the chains of memory come apart, the links will still be there. She agrees that it's a promise.
-   If Shepard enters into a romantic relationship with Liara in _Mass Effect_, at the conclusion of _Lair of the Shadow Broker_ in _Mass Effect 2_, Liara asks Shepard to promise her that s/he's always coming back. S/he does. Both she and Tali beg you to come back after the final battle in Mass Effect 3. Since it's currently assumed that ME3 is the end of the series (for Shepard), in one out of three endings, with a high enough EMS score, you can assume s/he keeps his/her promise. Since _Mass Effect: Andromeda_ takes place in an entirely different galaxy hundreds of years later, there's no way to know one way or the other.
-   _Minotaur Hotel_: P promises to Storm that once Storm figures himself out and learns to be independent, he will reconsider starting a relationship with him. Storm accepts his promise and tells him he'll be sure to become independent.
-   Defied in Advance Wars: Dual Strike. If Eagle and Sami are selected for the final Campaign Mission, Eagle will attempt to make a promise of survival with Sami who cuts him off telling him that if they make that promise, one of them will die.
-   In _Persona 3 Portable_, a romantic vow to stay together is apart of the last rank of the Justice Social Link for the female protagonist. What makes it so important is that it's with Ken Amada who's very insecure about their relationship.
    -   A bigger promise is for SEES to meet up again on Graduation Day, if they manage to beat Nyx.
-   In _Planescape: Torment_, your character can actually do this as a dialogue option. Sometimes, dialogue choices (in some specific, important and dramatic scenes) will have a declaration of intent hidden, such as "Truth", "Lie", and, most importantly, "Make Vow". Those dialogue choices affect your Character Alignment: you become more Lawful if you tell the truth, and more Chaotic if you lie.
-   _Shantae: Risky's Revenge_: As revealed after the first boss battle, Shantae's Uncle Mimic is keeping important information from her due to a promise he made to her mother, and he doesn't want to encourage her curiosity by telling her more.
-   In _Solatorobo_, Elh promises Red a billion rings if he helps to complete the Rite of Forfeit. Of course, Elh actually doesn't _have_ a billion rings and, if the Rite had gone as it usually did, Red wouldn't have needed them anyway. Red survived, however, and instead of being angry, he just invited Elh to join his team — ostensibly to work off that debt, of course, but nobody was fooled.
-   In a dream at the end of _SoulBlazer_, Lisa makes the player character promise her that he will return to her someday. You are not allowed to decline her request. And he does, in fact, return to her, albeit without his memories, but she says they can happily make new memories together.
-   In _Super Robot Wars: Original Generation Dark Prison_, Albharda asks Shu Shirakawa to defend Earth in its time of need. Shu ends up fulfilling that promise after he hears that Al died, sacrificing his life to let Selena Recital live.
-   _Trails Series_:
    -   In _Trails from Zero_, Lloyd tells Tio that he will protect her just like Guy did, but she tells him that he doesn't have to be the same as Guy, that he should find his own path. Later, the two discuss the promise and Lloyd admits that he still hasn't figured out his path. Tio then tells him she has a request of her own: to take her to Mishelam Wonderland when everything is over. Stunned, he asks if that's really all, that she could even say "When I'm in trouble, always come to my rescue." She tells him that it's more than enough, that in order for it to come true, they'll have to resolve the crisis anyway.
    -   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III_ — Lloyd Bannings told Juna Crawford that "Crossbell has many trials awaiting it. But we WILL overcome them. Juna, I want you to fight and struggle to overcome your own trials as well. And if anything happens, I'll come running — I promise." Later, if you do one of her bonding events, Rean tells her "If you run into any problems, just let me know. I'll come running — I promise." This ticks her off that he's reminding her of Lloyd, because she isn't quite ready to accept him yet.

-   _RWBY_:
    -   Jaune promises Pyrrha that if she can't get a date to the dance, he'll wear a dress and go with her. Guess what happens—even though Pyrrha didn't take the promise seriously in the first place.
        
        **Jaune:** Eh, a promise is a promise.  
        **Pyrrha:** _\[smiling and laughing\]_ Jaune! You didn't _have_ to!  
        **Jaune:** Hey, an Arc never goes back on his word.

        _\[the girls continue to embrace as Blake sobs\]_
        

    Webcomics 

-   _Gunnerkrigg Court_: Coyote promises Antimony she will not be harmed to lure her to the forest. Antimony points out that he's The Trickster and he finds it hilarous.
-   In _Impure Blood_, Err... well, we had sworn to. . . — while threatening to arrest Roan after he saved them. (Ungrateful Bastards. Good thing the question of Who Will Bell the Cat? arises.)
-   In _Mystery Babylon_, Kick Girl wanted to break the seal of the Pit in order to free Kill Boy, but as J.J. was dying he asked her to promise never to open it. Kick Girl promised, and spent the next thousand years protecting the seal on the Pit.
-   Promises are everywhere in _MYth: A Promise_ and the willing of keeping them is a mayor character tract. Keeping their promises is what makes difference between Cronus and Zeus, the two men choosen by Gaia, as Cronus promised that he would free the cyclops but doesn't keep it while Zeus does. Also, Zeus' determination in keeping his promises and Hades' promise to Rhea of protecting Zeus is Played for Drama when Zeus swears to hate Hades forever for him killing Metis, and Hades willingly accepts Zeus' hatred in order to make him a stronger man.
-   In _No Rest for the Wicked_,
-   _The Order of the Stick_: Roy's father, Eugene, swore a Blood Oath of Vengeance to seek out and destroy Xykon, the Big Bad. His failure to do so, plus his decision to abandon his quest, keep him in limbo even after his natural death and transfers the obligation to his heirs.
    -   He's incensed when his son, Roy, gets to go on to the afterlife proper, since Roy didn't fulfill the terms of the Oath either. It's pointed out by a Being of Pure Law and Good that Roy gets to move on because he died in direct pursuit of the quest his worthless flake of a father dumped on him by consciously abandoning it.
-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_: As far as Reynir's great-grandfather was concerned in the prologue, the world outside of Iceland was falling apart due to the Rash. On top of this, he was quitting his job in the coast guard because it had turned into enforcing Quarantine with Extreme Prejudice on any refugee boat that showed up from the rest of the world. Because of this, he promised himself to never tell any future children he may have about what's outside of Iceland and make them understand that they should never try leaving the country. Over the following ninety years, some people were discovered to be The Immune to the Rash and Iceland developped a program to enable parents who are not The Immune to have children who are. In addition, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland turned out to be still around as nations, albeit beaten up by The End of the World as We Know It. This resulted in Reynir being sheltered into staying in the family farm due to being both the youngest child and the only non-immune one, while his four older siblings each showed up at home twice a year with stories about being abroad. It's from one of them that he found out that the ban on non-immune people travelling outside of Iceland was actually no longer in place, when his parents had told him otherwise. It's safe to assume that the sheltering to which Reynir was subject has something to do with his great-grandfather's promise.
-   _Zomgan_: Gyeong Lee promises Mirae On that once human society is rebuilt, she'll kill him. Considering that Mirae On is immortal and has been desiring death, he looks in awe after Gyeong confirms that she can keep this promise.

Only it's not: turns out the consequences of breaking a royal promise are having to face trial by fire at the hands of the kingdom's giant Gumball Guardians.
