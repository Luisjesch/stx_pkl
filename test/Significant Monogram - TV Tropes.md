_"Moreover, as high school English teachers never tire of observing, the innocence of martyred fictional characters bearing the initials 'JC' must never be questioned. Indeed, as we first discover about an hour into_ The Green Mile_, this particular JC bears mysterious powers of healing, as well as monumental capacities for sympathy and forgiveness, that make his Biblical heritage even harder to ignore or, for filmgoers who prefer not to be beaten over the head, to put up with."_

A monogram is a symbol made from two or more letters — usually a person's initials. Sometimes a character's personality or destiny is indicated by his or her full name, whether it be a Steven Ulysses Perhero or a Louis Cypher. Sometimes, however, the character's full name seems perfectly ordinary, until you spot his or her monogram on a handkerchief or pen and find a funny "coincidence". This trope is about when a character's initials bear some significance to the story.

The most common Significant Monogram, of course, is "JC," most often seen on the Sacrificial Lamb, Messianic Archetype, or The Hero. Those initials can be found everywhere from Jesse Custer in _Preacher_ to Jiminy Cricket in _Pinocchio_ to John Connor in _The Terminator_ and its sequels to JC Denton to Julius Caesar.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  When those specific initials are used unintentionally and in a completely discordant manner with the character's role in the story, they can often lead to an almost literal Everyone Is Jesus in Purgatory situation.

However, sometimes initials may be used as a Shout-Out to another, pre-existing fictional character. It's almost certainly not a coincidence that so many fictional super-spies in the late 20th and early 21st century have had the initials "JB" (Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer, Jack Bristow, et al.) And sometimes the similarities may be subliminal or completely unintentional, as for instance with Gene Roddenberry's dashing, womanizing, handsome young hero who first debuted in 1966. Although ostensibly named after Capt. James Cook, his "JTK" monogram would be merely a stroke and a half away from the commonly-used monogram for a certain dashing, womanizing, handsome young president who had been martyred, in the eyes of many Americans, merely three years previously. Er... probably. In many cases, initials may be used to indicate an Author Avatar.

Compare to Significant Anagram, Meaningful Name, and Fun with Acronyms. Distinguished from Theme Initials in that Theme Initials are used for multiple characters in a story or universe and may have no significance outside of their recurrence, whereas Significant Monograms may be used for only one character in a story but refer to someone or something outside of that story. However, when Significant Monograms are used for multiple characters in a universe or work of fiction, it may easily become a case of Theme Initials.

It can also become an unfortunate name, particularly if other characters remark upon such initials as "BS," "ASS" or "FU." Often in comedies, an Embarrassing First Name or Embarrassing Middle Name may be employed to complete the monogram.

    JC and Other Variations 

Comic Books

-   Jesse Custer in _Preacher_. Gets Lampshaded by Tulip towards the end of the series run, with much good-natured mockery.
-   John Constantine and several other key characters in _Hellblazer_.

Film

-   John Connor in the _Terminator_ franchise, the future savior of humanity from the machines.
-   Jericho Caine in _End of Days_.
-   There's a Jericho Cane (real name Boxer Santoros) in _Southland Tales_, who turns out to be the Antichrist.
-   Variation: In the film _Greaser's Palace_, the character Jessy's name is often pronounced to sound like "JC." What do you mean it's not symbolic?
-   Joey Cusack, the mobster who is "resurrected" in _A History of Violence_. Subverted in that "Joey" is the exact opposite of Messianic.
-   James Cole in _12 Monkeys_.
-   John Carpenter in "The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)"

Literature

-   John Coffey in both novel and film _The Green Mile_.
    -   In his book _On Writing_, Stephen King notes how he hit on the name... and then gently mocks the critics who chastised him for going with the obvious initials. "Well, _duh!_ It's not rocket science, guys."
-   Jenny Curran in both novel and film _Forrest Gump_.
-   Jim Casy in _The Grapes of Wrath_.
-   Jim Conklin in _The Red Badge of Courage_. Apparently, this wasn't intentional, but it inspired a lot of crazy interpretations.
-   John Cotton in _Bless the Beasts & Children_.
-   Jerry Cornelius and his dozens of incarnations in the _Eternal Champion_ series. You know it's him because his initials are JC.

-   Johannes Cabal in _Johannes Cabal the Necromancer_.

Live-Action TV

-   John Crichton from _Farscape_ certainly has some messianic qualities: a non-corporeal god-like creature who took the form of his father gave him some pretty powerful powers; he is a an outcast in a strange land who likes to contrast his morality with others; also he has a perchance for self-sacrifice.
-   Jordan Collier on _The 4400_; he even comes back from the dead at one point.
-   British sketch show _Not the Nine O'Clock News_ ran a sketch parodying moral outrage at the film _Monty Python's Life of Brian_, in which a self-proclaimed Pythonist accused The Bible of being a rip-off of Python lore, pointing out that the main character's initials were the same as those of John Cleese.
-   _Firefly_: Jayne! The man they call Jayne! **J**ayne **C**obb not only bears the initials, but in "Jaynestown", we're introduced to a village that worships him as a folk hero.
-   John Casey from _Chuck_, who's often tempted to cross to the dark side but always stays loyal to the good guys. Although since he's played by Adam Baldwin, the initials could very well be a Shout-Out to _Firefly_—the show is just _full_ of them.
-   Jeremy Clarkson from _Top Gear_ mentions this during the Middle East Special when he begins to get delusions of grandeur near the Sea of Galilee.

Music

-   Jarvis Cocker refers to his own initials in the first line of Pulp's _The Dishes_, and then compares himself to Jesus in the chorus — "I am not Jesus, though I have the same initials... I'd like to make this water wine, but it's impossible."
-   _Kilroy Was Here_ features a character leading a pro-rock resistance named Jonathan Chance. Kind of like John Connor in _The Terminator_, except _Kilroy_ actually came out more than a year earlier.
-   The Powderfinger song 'J.C.' is _actually_ talking about Jesus in this case.

Video Games

-   JC Denton from _Deus Ex_.
-   John Cain from _One_, who is wrongfully accused and suffers to save humanity, much like Christ himself.

Webcomics

-   Jane Crocker from _Homestuck_. As a Hero of Life, she can resurrect people and heal their wounds. She's come back from the dead herself a few times, too.

Web Animation

-   Jebediah Christoff from _Madness Combat_. Bonus points for actually looking like Jesus.

Western Animation

-   Jiminy Cricket, the Only Sane Man in _Pinocchio_. No coincidence, since his name comes from a Bowdlerisation of Jesus Christ.
-   In one episode of _King of the Hill_, President Jimmy Carter settled a dispute at a Habitat For Humanity house. Bobby instantly invoked this, since Carter was "a carpenter, who worked a miracle, with the initials J.C.".

Real Life

-   For a Protestant fundamentalist, Jack Chick has a rather fortunate set of initials.
-   Many decades before it became a thing, we had Julius Caesar. Indeed, coming so soon in the wake of Caesar's legacy, it may be that Jesus Christ's movement was a beneficiary of having the same initials as Julius Caesar.

Comic Books

-   Minor Justice League foe **I**ra **Q**uimby (whose power is enhanced intellect).

Fan Fiction

-   A _ton_ of _Harry Potter_ fics assign Sirius Black the middle name "Orion", making his initials SOB, which is also commonly used as an initialism for "son of a bitch".

-   _Miraculous Ladybug_:

Literature

-   In the Oz books, the Wizard of Oz is named Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkel Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs. Because this is so long, he typically shortens it to O.Z.P.I.N.H.E.A.D., which he (for understandable reasons) further shortens to O.Z. Which is why he became the ruler of Oz.
-   In the _Uglies_ series, one of the character's names is Andrew Simpson Smith.

Real Life

-   Nineteenth-century military buff Hiram U. Grant was reportedly always embarrassed by the weak-sounding implications of his monogram. That is until his application for West Point, when his Congressman, who nominated him for acceptance, apparently mistook his middle name for his first name and his mother's maiden name for his middle initial and submitted him under the much more patriotic initials "Ulysses S. Grant," which Hiram kept throughout the remainder of his career as general and later as president. During The American Civil War he became known as "**U**nconditional **S**urrender Grant".

    **Hank:** Mr. Holloway, this is the only man ever censured by the Texas Propane Association, for lewdness and conduct unbecoming a propane salesman.

Web Comics

-   _Homestuck_: During an intermission, Nanna Egbert reveals that her Evil Matriarch, Betty Crocker, wasn't human. A while later, we've almost forgotten about it - until Feferi's ancestress shows up, in a warship titled _B_attleship _C_ondescension.

Real Life

-   In the Library of Congress Classification scheme used by most college and university libraries in the U.S. and Canada, Bibles and Bible commentaries are shelved under call numbers starting with the letters "BS". At the reference desk, we'd tell students to use the memetic "Bible Studies".
