Regimental, but (hopefully) not saluting.

_"I'm not wearing underwear today  
No, I'm not wearing underwear today  
Not that you probably care  
Much about my underwear  
Still nonetheless I gotta say:  
That I'm not wearing underwear todaaaaaay!"_

Simply put, a character isn't wearing underwear for some reason. According to The Other Wiki, "'Going commando' is reputed to have begun with commando and other special forces military units, in which some soldiers stopped wearing underwear to prevent chafing."

When a male does it, it's generally played for humor, squick, arousal or if he's wearing a kilt, in which it's known as "Going Regimental". When a female does it, it's usually treated as fetish material, though it _might_ be Played for Laughs as well. Going braless, in general, is a different story ("going commando" means no under_pants_) — that said, bralessness can be played for the same purposes, and is included in the examples on this page. Lack of underwear may also be averted or lampshaded in the case of a Half-Dressed Cartoon Animal of either sex.

If it is obvious that a character is **Going Commando** and/or it is played for Fanservice purposes, it is Vapor Wear.

Compare Naked in Mink, Diamonds in the Buff, Full-Frontal Assault (for when the fighter decides to forgo more than his boxers).

Other names for Going Commando can be identically separate in these variations as well, e.g. "Free(-)balling" is for Males and "Free(-)buffing" is for Females.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040_, the Knights Saber are at first commando in their plug suits. Later, they don't even get plugsuits and are naked under their upgraded power armor (which is now transparent in places). Lampshaded by Sylia when she tells Mackie that "he's in the girls' changing room" when they're discussing it, and a totally flustered Mackie runs away all red-faced.
-   In _Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash_, Haruhiro's group did this since they can't afford to buy more clothes.
-   _Hensuki: Are You Willing to Fall in Love with a Pervert, as Long as She's a Cutie?_:
    -   In Episode 9, Sayuki goes on a date with Keiki without wearing panties for the thrill of it, which is why she spends the entire date self-conscious about her skirt.
    -   In fifth grade, Mizuha forgot to bring panties to change into after swim class and she had to spend the entire day like that, which she found liberating. Afterwards, she often goes to school without panties and secretly takes strip tease selfies in order to experience this feeling of liberation. This habit is also the reason why her panties were left behind with her love letter.
-   To the surprise of no one, the standard combat uniform of _Kill la Kill_'s resident resistance group, Nudist Beach, does not include underwear. In fact, their organization's insignia is a crossed-out speedo.
-   _Log Horizon_ mentions this being true at first: apparently, Adventurer outfits do not come with underwear of any kind. Once the Adventurers work out how to produce goods in this world, underwear _immediately_ becomes a best-selling clothes item, particularly among female Adventurers.
-   During the second New Year's chapter of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid Life_, both Fate and Einhart end up wearing kimonos without any underwear (the former because of a misconception when she was a child and the latter because the former dressed her). And then Einhart ends up having a Wardrobe Malfunction while out in public.
-   The manga _Shiritsu Hakanai Gakuen_ begins with Hanao placing a ban on underwear after becoming class president, making it mandatory for all students at the school to go commando.

-   _Godannar_ has the pilots commando when in their spandex piloting outfits. Confirmed in the last few episodes.
-   _Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches_: After introducing herself as the seventh witch, Rika Saionji asks if Yamada always goes commando. Embarrassed, he realizes this was Shiraishi's doing while switching bodies. Rika's not shy to admit to being a pervert herself for doing the same thing, claiming to have accidentally come to school without panties on one occasion and found the experience so thrilling that she hasn't worn any ever since. She then tells him that he shouldn't hide his true self around her since they're both the same, to which Yamada vehemently disagrees to the prospect of "free balling". As she's leaving, a breeze comes through showing that she was telling the truth.
-   _Yuuutsu-kun to Succubus-san_: Eru's top is a shirt with long sleeves that only goes down past her breasts. A long gown covers the rest of her body from the stomach down. In a moment of A-Cup Angst, Sakuma flips her "boob skirt" and unwittingly discovers that Eru doesn't wear anything underneath. The humiliation of the moment leaves Eru huddled in a fetal position next to, and just like, the chronically depressed Yuu.

    Comedy 

-   Jeff Foxworthy did a stand-up routine about this trope and gender roles. When a woman mentions that she's not wearing underwear, it's a turn-on for men. When a man mentions not wearing underwear, the reaction from women is quite different.
    
    **Jeff:** _\[as a distraught wife\]_ Good Lord, I'm going to have to wash those pants _twice_!

    Literature 

-   _Bodies Are Where You Find Them_: A plot point. When the authorities find the body of murder victim Helen Stallings, she was wearing a dress and nothing underneath.

-   _Friends_:
    -   Joey does it. It's mentioned a few times.
    -   Joey was once wearing Chandler's pants — not just a _pair_ of Chandler's pants, but _all of Chandler's pants_. But prior to the pants-wearing, it's invoked by name to explain why Joey can't wear a rental tux after Chandler hid all the clothing Joey owned but wasn't wearing.
    -   Ross was trying to get everyone ready for an important (black tie) work event he needs to be at. It's almost a disaster especially with Ross's loss of patience over Rachel's inability to decide what to wear. At the very end of the episode, Rachel finally chooses a skintight dress and, as a form of titillation, she tells Ross she's going commando just as she walks out the door.
    -   In one episode, Phoebe is dating a guy who consistently wears loose shorts without underwear, causing the other guys to recoil in horror every time he sits down and puts his foot on the table and ends up flashing everybody.

        **Gunther:** Hey buddy, this is a family place. Put the mouse back in the house.
        
    -   Chandler once dated a woman (played by Julia Roberts) who suggested that he wore her underwear instead of his. It was treated as though she had a fetish for it. It is hinted that she went commando during the dinner date. It was actually a plot to humiliate him.

-   The werewolves and other shapeshifters in _True Blood_ don't wear underpants. According to Word of God, this is for practical reasons (presumably they are in the way when you need to shift forms quickly). Oddly enough, these "practical reasons" don't seem to stop female shifters from wearing bras.

    Theatre 

-   The song "I'm Not Wearing Underwear Today" from _Avenue Q_.

    Video Games 

-   Theoretically, given that of all the characters shown undressed during the sex scenes in the _Mass Effect_ trilogy everyone who is shown wearing underwear is human, we have no evidence anyone else wears underwear at all. It could be merely a human invention.
-   _Pokémon_: Gardevoir and Gothitelle, two feminine-looking Pokémon that both appear to be wearing dresses. Since the "dresses" are part of their bodies, they don't wear anything underneath (not that there's really anything under them).

    Visual Novels

## Female

    Advertising 

-   A 2007 Ukrainian advertisement for Russian telecommunications company Beeline includes a scene with several couples dancing, cutting to a very low shot just as one dancer performs a twirl that makes her dress fly way up. In one version of the ad, this dancer is wearing white panties, while in a second version with a slightly different voiceover, she isn't wearing any panties at all. When this version reached the Internet and quickly became quite widespread, the company responded to the ensuing scandal by claiming that it was the result of digital image editing.
-   Brooke Shields had a famous commercial with the statement "Nothing comes between me and my Calvin Kleins".
-   A Rover MG commercial has girl's skirt blow up due to two guy's zooming by in a car, revealing her to be under this trope. That being said, the most naughty bits are covered by a censor shadow.

-   _Arcade Gamer Fubuki_. Fubuki had to go through this trope when her panties were stolen in episode two.
-   Natsu-Megu from _As the Gods Will_ doesn't wear panties under a skirt.
-   In _Baccano!_, several of the female characters wear pretty low-cut clothing (for the standards of the time), and almost none of them seem to have anything on underneath.

Then she asks her totally not boyfriend Kosuda if he likes girls who go around without panties, but runs away before he can answer. Then at the end, he confronts her, slamming open the door and demanding to know the meaning behind the question... and the wind from the door blows up her skirt, and suddenly everything makes sense.
-   _Black God_: Since Kuro is extremely sheltered, she does not really understand underwear and cannot be convinced to wear it.

-   _Buso Renkin_: Towards the end of the series there is a brief fanservice scene of Tokiko getting ready for a mission, which briefly shows that she doesn't wear any underwear beneath either her casual clothes, or her signature Sailor Fuku uniform.
-   _Cahe Detective Club_: Miyu isn't usually concerned about her panties showing. However one day she forgot to bring them to change after swimming class. This made her embarrassed and careful about what she does until her swimsuit can dry for half the day. The next day after her ordeal, she made sure not to forget them... by wearing them under her swimsuit.
-   _Case Closed_:
    -   Whenever Shiho/Ai goes to her original body, she has enough luck to find clothes at all, but she has to go around without any underwear.
    -   There is one chapter where she returned to her child body without any child-sized clothing around after doing a dangerous task on her own, which also caused her to fall unconscious. However, it turns out Conan is secretly following and watching her to ensure she is safe, and it's obvious that until the end of the chapter, even when she is already conscious again, all she's wearing is Conan's jacket.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_:
    -   Kanzaki Kaori wears _no_ undergarments whatsoever (bra, panties, or socks). When Touma destroyed Index's outfit when they first met, she wasn't wearing undergarments. Oriana Thompson arranges her clothes in a way to make it clear she doesn't have anything underneath.

-   Run in _A Channel_ discovers she accidentally forgot to put socks on _both_ feet, while bending down to take the one sock off, Tooru, standing behind her, discovers Run forgot something _else_ too.
-   Chii in _Chobits_ is naked when she's first picked up by Hideki. He gives her his own clothing immediately and is given "hand me downs" from Miss Hibeya but she's definitely lacking underwear. Buying her some is the plot of an entire episode. The fact that she has no clue what a bra is is brought up later. In the manga when she gives Yumi her work uniform she's noticeably topless. This was bowdlerised in the anime to where she's finally wearing a bra.
-   In _Cross Ange_, Ange is captured by Embryo and forced to strip naked. While escaping, she knocks out Salia and steals her uniform. Since Salia was in her underwear when discovered, that meant Ange wasn't wearing anything underneath.
-   _Date A Live_:
    -   Tohka did not wear a bra for several months after her powers were sealed due to not knowing their purpose. After she switched to the lighter summer uniform Shidou noticed and quickly corrected her, pointing out the trouble she'd have if her white uniform shirt got wet.
    -   In Season 3, during a date between Shidou and Origami, Origami teases him by saying she's not wearing anything under her clothes, and partially opens her jacket to prove it.
-   In the dub of _Digimon Tamers_, Bridge Bunnies Riley (Reika) and Tally (Megumi) find Calumon running around the control room. And then...
    
    **Calumon:** Calumon, zoom zoom, here a zoom, there a zoom! Calumon, zoom zoom, NO UNDERWEAR, ZOOM!
    
-   Early in _Dragon Ball_, Goku once removed Bulma's panties while she was sleeping (and freaked out because he thought her balls had been cut off) and she remained unaware of it. When Muten Roshi asked to see her panties in exchange for his Dragon Ball, she lifted her skirt in front of him. It was only after she and Goku returned to their capsule house that she realized she had been going commando since the previous night, and it only got worse for her when she realized what Roshi really saw. She let Goku have it upon finding out that it was he who took them off.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   Erza often doesn't wear underwear and is even quite fascinated by Lucy's large selection of underwear (especially the sexy ones). It is greatly played for Fanservice when she is turned into a child by some weird magic during the Sun Village arc. Her skirt, armor, and boots become too big for her and fall off, though her shirt doesn't fall off but is now big enough to act like a dress. When she is turned back, it becomes obvious that she didn't wear panties under her skirt, and with her skirt now being too short to cover her lower body, she fights completely bottomless for a while and isn't even especially ashamed about it.
    -   Juvia's outfit in the Tartaros arc consists of a coat and pretty much nothing else. The leg-line on it is so high it goes past her hips and up into her waist, showing there's nothing at all down there beneath that coat.
-   _Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA_: When everyone gets ready for a festival, Rin Tohsaka pranks Luvia Edelfelt by telling her yukata are traditionally worn without underwear. Later, when they are talking to Shirou, Rin says only a complete pervert would go out in public with no underwear. Nearby, Illya is horrified to hear this, and a Wardrobe Malfunction reveals she wasn't wearing any either.
-   In the ending animation for _Galilei Donna_ Hozuki is shown to be only wearing a pair of overalls with no visible signs of underwear.
-   _Ghost Talker's Daydream_: Misaki part-times as a columnist for a porn magazine<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and gets reminded that the prize that the company is supposed to send to a reader is a pair of her panties. Since she hadn't brought any spare ones, she leaves the ones she was wearing. A few minutes later, she stumbles over the power cord of the janitor's floor buffer and falls down, giving him an unobstructed view of her nether region.
-   _Girls und Panzer Motto Love Love Sakusen_ implies that Saemonza and Oryou of Hippo Team forgo underwear on the basis that it wasn't regular women's wear in the Sengoku and Bakumatsu Eras.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_: At one point, Fuyutsuki's panties are stolen by three students, who then spread the word that she isn't wearing underwear.
-   One episode of _Grenadier_ had Rushuna get her panties shot off. The poor girl ended up running around the battlefield with her hand on her crotch while wailing "NOOOOO!!!" (Bad enough she ran out of ammo before it happened.)
    -   In the manga version, she didn't seem to mind much, and quickly forgot about it. With predictable results.
-   Female haibane from _Haibane Renmei_ can't wear bras because of their wings.
-   The omake side story of _Hatsukoi Limited_ is about Andou Soako going through an entire (school) day without her undergarments, and trying to keep anyone from finding out.
-   In _Heaven's Lost Property_, anime and manga, Sohara goes around like that for a whole episode/chapter. Against her will. She's also unable to wear any underwear... anything whatsoever in fact... and if she tries it flies away. Literally. That's just the kind of show it is. Never give magic powers to a perverted protagonist.
-   In _Hekikai no AiON_, Seine spends half the 5th chapter without panties because those were her only pair and got ruined. She also seems to use no bra.
-   Shiro from _The Helpful Fox Senko-san_ is proudly advertised in her introductory chapter as wearing no panties, and the way she's drawn and the shots are composed frequently provide evidence. Part of it is possibly because she's a _kitsune_ demi-goddess.
-   _High School D×D_: Kuroka doesn't wear any undergarments under her kimono, as she demonstrates in one scene where she drops her kimono to go Skinny Dipping. However, in the manga version, she does have underwear.
-   _Infinite Stratos_: In one episode, the device that Charlotte uses to transform her clothes into her Powered Armor malfunctions, so any panties she tries to put on disintegrate. She is too embarrassed to tell anybody about this, and the reason why she doesn't just remove the device is that she wants to be ready to transform to protect Ichika from any threats. So she spends the whole day trying desperately to not let anyone know she isn't wearing panties. At the end, she decides to be honest and let Ichika know, but Laura out of nowhere lifts her skirt. Fortunately, the device had sorted itself out and gave her back her panties.
-   Jolyne Cujoh from _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean_ tends to not wear panties, typically by complete accident. When her cellmate, Gwess, tells her that she forgot to put panties on, Jolyne freaks out and high-tails it to the top bunk to put some on.
-   Teenage hit-woman Chinatsu from _Jormungand_ never wears panties to a fight, which comes as a shock to most of the rival characters who often don't notice until they're in the middle of a pitched gun battle. She does, however, have a good excuse for it...
    
    **Chinatsu:** The first job I ever did with Master, the target's house was on the far side of a river. Skulking around in wet undies felt _gross_. So I snuck away and took them off. I hit _everything_ I aimed at that day. I even shot better than Master did. He _complimented_ me for it.  
    **Koko Hekmatyar:** _\[snicker\]_ Y-you're a _better_ shot _without_ underwear? _\[snort\]_  
    **Chinatsu:** That's right.  
    **Koko Hekmatyar:** Bwa ha ha! That's a _great_ story!
    
-   Secondary character and Action Girl Masaki from _Jōjū Senjin!! Mushibugyō_ wears a rather short skirt which nicely display her legs, coated in armored stocking (you read that right) and has a very acrobatic kick-based fighting style. As confirmed by a Manga Omake made shortly after her debut, she's not wearing any type of underwear, though the shots where she should be flashing the reader (including the one where demonstrates her lack of panties in said Omake) have her crotch deeply shaded so that nothing is seen.
-   In _K_, Neko, the resident CloudCuckooLander Innocent Fanservice Girl forgets her panties in HOMRA's headquarters. Somehow. Despite the fact that she is very pretty and sometimes fanservicey, this is treated as humorous - mostly at the expense of the character who volunteers to return her stuff without realizing _exactly what it was_ she'd left there.
-   Shigure from _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_. She never wears a bra. However, when fighting seriously, she dons chain mail and wears a black strap under her breast to keep the chain mail in place.
-   Numerous shots of Aqua's rear end in _KonoSuba_ imply that she's not wearing panties. Further reinforced when Kazuma uses his Steal ability to steal her raiment and actually gets it (when he uses it on women he normally ends up stealing their panties instead no matter what he was trying to take.) It becomes a subversion when it's revealed lore-wise that Aqua actually _does_ have panties on, but to keep Peeping Toms from looking up her skirt at them, she made them invisible.
-   Ashua in _Lotte No Omocha_ frequently doesn't wear underwear. Probably has something to do with her half-succubus nature.
-   A very rare example that is Played for Drama in _Love, Election & Chocolate_: poor Isara has her underwear _violently removed in an empty lot and thrown to the garbage by a trio of bullies_ (all female, thankfully), and has to go about for the rest of her day (which lasts, mind you, until way after midnight, since she has to work so many jobs to keep feeding her family) without any. She is shown to be exactly as miserable as any real person would be in the situation.
-   In a _Lupin III: Part II_ episode named "Albatross: Wings of Death", the villains strip Fujiko to find what she stole. They don't find it but have no reason to allow her to dress, either. She spends the majority of the episode without underwear, or much of anything on, really. Somewhat odd in that this is one of the two second series episodes directed by Hayao Miyazaki!
-   The rather Fanservicey episode 8 of _Macross Frontier_ has a Ridiculously Cute Critter run off with Sheryl's panties by accident while she's showering at school, and given that she's the hottest Idol Singer in the _entire galaxy_ at the moment, causes a few issues with _every single male student_ (except three) chasing after the Panty Thief to get the prize, seemingly with more desire to get it as treasure than to return them to her. Meanwhile, Plucky Girl Sheryl grabs Powered Armor and rampages across campus to get them back. In a skirt. A Magic Skirt as the implication of Sheryl chasing her panties in a skirt is this trope.
-   Played for laughs in the third episode of _Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi_: Arumi's panties are stolen by a goblin while she's relieving herself behind a bush, and then she's subjected to just about every suggestive trope in Humongous Mecha anime, from a skimpy minidress to a giant robot with a suggestive piloting position. She's mortified but her companion Sasshi never notices, as he's too busy with the rest of the Humongous Mecha anime tropes.
-   _Maken-ki!_: Haruko, Inaho, and Azuki wound up spending the entirety of chapters 22-24 without their underwear, after Minerva used her dimensional powers to steal them because she forgot to give 'em back.
-   _Miss Machiko_ often goes braless, as evident by the number of pranks her students play on her which ends with her shirt removed and her breasts exposed. This was a kids' show, by the way.
-   Ooga, one of the Stalker Trio in _Mitsudomoe_ gets so upset at the object of her affections apparently liking panties more than anything she immediately takes hers off, kicks them into the stratosphere, and swears to never wear them again.
-   Several of the girls in _Monster Musume_ have bodies unsuited to undergarments, with various results:
    -   Centorea never wears any underwear whatsoever. Aside from it being untraditional for her people, it would be very difficult to find something in her size upstairs, and they don't exactly manufacture things for her downstairs.
    -   Miia, lacking legs, obviously can't wear normal panties, so she wears a triangle of adhesive fabric in their place.
    -   Meroune also lacks legs, and can't use Miia's adhesive solution due to her constantly moist skin. Not that it's a problem due to her preference for frilly Elegant Gothic Lolita\-style dresses.
    -   Suu, being a slime, can barely wear any clothing at all without getting it soaking wet, let alone underwear. She usually wears a full-body yellow raincoat when out in public.
    -   Rachnera has the same sort of difficulties as Centorea, and she enjoys teasing Kimihito with Stripperiffic outfits anyway.
    -   Lala and Papi both have a sufficiently humanoid body plan to accommodate normal underwear. Since Papi's wings lack Feather Fingers, however, she does find it difficult to adjust them, as shown in one of the canon animated short segments.
-   _My-HiME_: Natsuki had to go commando once because all of her underwear was stolen. Then a Dramatic Wind blew when she was talking to Takeda...
-   _My Monster Secret_: Shiho the _pervert_. She's responsible for most of the little fanservice the series has, so every once in a while she either makes a joke about her not wearing her panties, or "borrows" a pair from other girls (while they're still wearing them, somehow). To prevent constant unthinking fapping from her male audience, Shiho is a Gender Bender; it's literally in her werewolf genes.
-   A chapter of _Nana & Kaoru_ has Kaoru making Nana walk around the park without any underwear on. He has to jump through hoops making sure nobody encounters her while she's doing this.
-   Aruka Schild from _NEEDLESS_. It's even lampshaded in one episode preview. She is notorious for wearing naughty clothing. Her second bad guy uniform in particular makes it clear she isn't wearing any undergarments south of the border. In the anime bonus shorts, Cruz recognizes his sister in the last episode by the fact that she is pantyless before she takes the mask off. (Cruz also recognizes Setsuna in the manga by her striped panties before seeing her face.) Additionally, at the very end of the manga when Blade acquires the power to make any wish a reality, he alters Japanese history 3000 years in the past to make "Naked with Gloves" and "Naked with Socks" into traditional modes of dress for women. So now in hot weather chicks walk around in public wearing nothing but gloves or socks and shoes. Because it was so far back in time, NO ONE NOTICES THE CHANGE. DANGIT BLADE.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_: Jack Rakan can steal the panties of all of Fate's minions except the dragon girl Tamaki. Guess why?
    -   According to Akamatsu himself, Tamaki goes commando because her tail makes panties _very_ uncomfortable for her, so she decided to just be practical about it. As a matter of fact, her _entire race_ goes underwear-less for this reason.
    -   Sometimes Asuna is prone to end up like this as well, with her Magic Annulment being the indirect culprit. When she's hit by spells of any kind, her clothes go poof.

-   In _Nichijou_, the Professor pulls a "Freaky Friday" Flip on her and Nano and then runs off to play. Nano finds it hard to run due to the Professor's little body and the oversized lab coat she wears. Nano tries to roll up the lab coat to make it easier but has to abandon that tactic when she realizes the Professor neglected to put on underwear before the swap.
-   Heavily implied in the redraw and anime of _One-Punch Man_, where many shots imply that Tatsumaki is wearing just her dress, and _only_ her dress. The anime confirms this in one scene where her bare butt was visible. Considering her ridiculous psychic powers and the length of the strips at the end of said dress, actually getting a peek would be nigh-impossible, nevermind _attempting_ would be suicidal.
    -   In the original webcomic, King claimed to have seen her panties once, she has a bunch of panty shots later on afterwards in the webcomic, and Murata has stated she DOES wear underwear. So this may be just a stylistic choice/oversight.
-   _Oni Ai_: Episode 11. At least Anastasia's companions have to worry about ghosts while she tries to be as inconspicuous about this trope as her pride pushes her to on their walk. And in Episode 3 a gust of wind immediately prove that Arashi isn't teasing when she claims to fit this trope, in front of the rest of the dorm folks.
-   In _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_, Panty Anarchy's main power is that she can turn any underwear into a gun and back. Since she tends to use her own panties for this, she goes commando in battle. Her Evil Counterpart Scanty Daemon has a similar ability and does the same thing. Panty occasionally borrows Stocking's panties so she can go Guns Akimbo. Which means Stocking sometimes fit this trope as well.
-   Nanami forgets to bring her underwear to the pool in Episode 8 of _The Pet Girl of Sakurasou_. Misaki makes fun of her for it at the end of the episode when they're back at Sakura Hall.
-   Nowa in _Queen's Blade_ doesn't wear underwear. She lives with elves, who don't do much better - their usual underwear is _a pair of crossed leaves_. Echidna, meanwhile, only wears a snake along her lower body - and when her lower half's off-camera, she likes to wear it on her shoulders instead...
    
    **Aira:** _(holding a scythe to Nowa's throat)_ You're such a wild girl... you're not even wearing underwear.  
    **Leina:** S-She doesn't?!?  
    **Nanael:** Elves are really nasty bitches, too...

-   Various characters in _Saki_ do not wear panties, among them Nodoka, Hatsumi, and Shizuno.
-   Maria from _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_ does this constantly. Doesn't wear shoes or socks either. Though in her case it's more from innocence than sexuality, plus the fact that wearing any of these things apparently gives her vertigo.
    -   In one episode, all the girls are wearing Kimonos and Maria is squirming uncomfortably. Someone asks why. She says that "she's been forced into wearing some". People assume she means underwear, but no, she's referring to socks.
-   _Seitokai Yakuindomo_, always played for laughs.
    -   Aria never wears underwear, although she sometimes wears a chastity belt. Her family has a nudist tradition (on top of other kinks), so she often forgets it when she goes out, sometimes even wearing _nothing_ but the outermost layer of clothing.

Who is her older brother Yasuhito. And then, they get _gruesomely_ killed off by Oni, the Shadow Dragon of Hiroko, the poor girl she and her Girl Posse mercilessly tormented to monstrous degrees. Aki herself gets the absolute worst of it, as Oni kills her in karmic but very sickening fashion. In the anime this was bowdlerised: she was wearing a knee-length pink nightgown and a pair of brown tights.
-   _Shimoneta_: Whenever Ayame uses her Blue Snow disguise in public, all she wears is a bedsheet as a cloak and uses her panties as a mask. Promotional art for the series (including the Blu-ray/DVD box cover art) shows she's stark naked underneath it.
-   Mayumi in _SHUFFLE!_ found out the hard way that flinging her clothes where she can't find them is a bad idea, especially while changing into a maid uniform. She only got her panties back later that evening. In the anime, the situation gets even worse thanks to a gust of wind.
-   The Fanservice(ier) episode of _Strike Witches_ has one character with missing panties, Francesca Lucchini, turn into a Panty Thief.

-   _Tentomushi no Uta_: The five-year-old protagonist Hiyoko Isshuu has a habit of not bothering to put on a new pair of panties when she hangs her underwear to dry after washing them. Much to her dismay, this often leads to her in predicaments where her rear end is exposed (the anime was made in the 1970's and these circumstances were intended to be comical in nature rather than unsavory).
-   _The Testament of Sister New Devil_: Deliberately invoked by Chisato, during a scene at her apartment. She has her nephew, Basara, stand behind her and tells him to hold her tightly against himself while she prepares dinner for them.

-   _That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime_: In the spin-off _Slime Diaries_, a heat wave strikes the Jura Forest. Shion happily suggests that if it does get hotter, they can take off a layer of clothes that's not visible, just like she is today. Shuna quickly pushes her out of the room before she can blurt her commando status to Rimuru.
-   One chapter of _To Love Ru_ had Yami accidentally cut Yui's panties off, forcing Yui to go commando for the rest of the day.
    -   In the sequel "Darkness", Nemesis wears absolutely _nothing_ under her dress. Yabuki was only _too_ happy to drug the censors and show us exactly how much _nothing_ she wears.
-   In _Urara Meirocho_, Chiya doesn't wear any underwear, and indeed is not even familiar with the concept of undergarments.
-   Merle in _The Vision of Escaflowne_. Then again, she _is_ a Cat Girl, and with that tail of hers, it'd be hard to put on ANY kind of panties... It's subverted in The Movie, where she is drawn as wearing white panties underneath, though how exactly they are cut to accommodate her tail is not shown.
-   Not played for either humor or fanservice in _Waiting in the Summer_: Mio has a habit of occasionally forgetting her underwear due to being raised as a nudist, despite also being a Shrinking Violet.

This originates from a cover by Alex Ross where she is clearly wearing nothing under her skirt.
-   Scarlet Witch, when George Pérez drew her in this costume.<small>◊</small>

    -   Noel Vermillion was suspected by fans for a long time, but this was disproven by EXTEND. Then again, there's official artwork (warning: NSFW) saying otherwise...
    -   Noel's case was brought on by a Freeze-Frame Bonus that may have just been an artist oversight: during her aerial barrier block, her skirt flaps so one can see up past her hips, with no waistband in sight, which put a new angle on the fact no other sprite showed her panties. Since then, official art and other sources have gone back and forth on the issue, perhaps deliberately.
-   _Brave Nine_: Spatti wears a tanktop zipped down to show the entirety of her cleavage while Stadione wears a shirt with several slits going down it. It's obvious that neither lady is wearing a bra.

-   _Fatal Fury_ and _The King of Fighters_: Bonne Jenet's backless with a high slit on the right side dress and kicks make it look like she's not wearing underpants. This is especially noticeable when she's doing her stiletto attack or gets KO'd, as both have frames that can make you suspect she's flashing her goods. This might be from an oversight in the development of _Garou: Mark of the Wolves_ that was carried over into Jenet's _King of Fighters XI_ appearance, since her official art for _Mark of the Wolves_ shows a strap of her underwear<small>◊</small>. As does her King of Fighters: Maximum Impact 2 official art<small>◊</small> and model<small>◊</small>.

-   In _Mortal Kombat 9_, Sonya Blade doesn't wear any underwear. It's more noticeable when she's getting brutally slaughtered in certain Fatalities, but when her pants/shorts get torn, nothing. When you're risking being pulled into a spinning saw blade lady-parts first, underwear isn't the biggest concern.
-   The limited-edition figurine of _Mushihime Sama_ protagonist Reco lacks panties under its skirt (presumably because in the figurine, Reco is sitting on a stump, and you'd have to go out of your way to detach her from the stump). This was later brought up in a Famitsu interview with director Tsuneki Ikeda and producer Makoto Asada, where Ikeda confirmed that she canonically does not wear any underpants. Hilariously, Asada's only thought on the matter was to ask Ikeda if that means she can pee standing up.
-   _Persona 3_:
    -   Evoked in a quite funny form. Cute kid Ken asks the main character if girls were Going Commando in the New year festival, and then he also asks what Going Commando means (he overheard it from Junpei, who also comments this). Note that this is because the girls are all wearing kimonos at the festival and it's true in several Japanese regions that kimonos/yukatas aren't worn with underwear. If you play through the female protagonist's story in the portable version, Ken asks "aren't you girls cold?" with equally hilarious results.
    -   Better yet, Junpei may ask the female MC if it's actually true that girls wear nothing under a kimono/yukata. The possible answers are "Yes.", "No." and "I'll leave that to your imagination."
-   _Under Night In-Birth_: A common joke in the game regarding the female cast as a lot of the their animations and frames show no signs of underwear being worn. This is apparently completely intentional as the head of the development team decreed this as to not show visible panties in the game. Alternate Colors are however fair-game for certain characters.
-   _Sonic the Fighters_: Unlike in later games, Amy wears no panties. Neither does guest fighter Honey the Cat in the digital rerelease.
-   _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_: Thanks to some...intrusive digging, Krystal has been found<small>◊</small> to not wear underwear under her clothes.
-   Komako's Dark Secret in _Yandere Simulator_ is that she did this for a few years because she read that shrine maidens did the same. Ryoba can spread that around to ruin Komako's reputation.

I'm not wearing anything under it."

-   _The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald_: A brief glimpse up Birdie's skirt when the gang jump into a barrel to hide from an angry mob during their trip to the Wild West in "Have Time, Will Travel" shows that her period-appropriate attire apparently doesn't include underwear. Given that her usual apparel is some sort of jumpsuit (making it impossible to determine if she has anything on underneath) and most of the eras the gang visit are periods known to predate when it became common for women to wear underwear (i.e. prehistoric times, the Middle Ages and the aforementioned Wild West), it's anyone's guess whether Birdie ordinarily goes commando or if it was only for the outfit worn in the Wild West.

-   _Fantastic Max_: In "The Big Sleep", Max's rear pajama flap is open and you can see he isn't wearing his diaper under it for some reason.
-   _Futurama_: The uniform worn by Zapp Brannigan and his crew consists of a jacket, white cowboy boots and _no pants whatsoever_. Judging by Kif Kroker's disgusted expression after looking up while climbing up a ladder after Zapp, the latter probably also refuses to wear another piece of garment.
-   _Gravity Falls_: In "Dungeons, Dungeons, and More Dungeons", a villain from the world of DD&MD turns Dipper into an elf, complete with medieval clothes that don't include trousers.
    
    **Dipper:** There better be something protective under this tunic... (_turns to peek, then covers his crotch with a mortified expression_) Oh _no_, there isn't!
    
-   In the first _Hey Arnold!_ episode, Arnold and Gerald are headed to their school play, dressed as a banana and a strawberry, but "accidentally" miss their stop, instead winding up downtown. When Arnold suggests that they at least take off their costumes, Gerald sheepishly admits that he didn't wear anything underneath. "Polyester makes me sweat!"
-   In one episode of _Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H._, Hulk's iconic pants briefly get caught on a statue's spear, revealing he's wearing nothing underneath.
-   In the episode "Upside-Down Magic" of _Magic Adventures of Mumfie_, our titular protagonist gets scared by Pinkey yelling "Boo!" at him and falls in the bushes. Scarecrow picks him up from the bushes and asks Mumfie if he's okay, and he is, but he ripped his pants, revealing no underwear underneath. Then again, this is a world where people get bad dreams rather than potty emergencies after eating or drinking too much food...
-   In one _Metalocalypse_ episode, Murderface is introduced to the concept of "freeballing it". Nathan and Skwisgaar reveal they rarely wear underwear. Well, Skwisgaar. Nathan estimates that he only wears underwear 65% of the time, which isn't really "rarely". Freeballing actually improves Murderface's bass playing, so there's that.
-   In the _Regular Show_ episode "Diary", one of Mordecai's secrets is this trope. Made funnier by the fact that he doesn't actually wear clothes.
    
    **Mordecai:** I like going commando! Beat. A LOT!
    
-   _Rugrats (2021)_: In "The Big Diff", Angelica tells Tommy and Chuckie that they can't be best friends because they're too different, so Tommy tries to be more like Chuckie. He dresses in a blue shirt and green pants and takes off his diaper from inside the latter. When he gets upset over him and Chuckie having to go their separate ways because they're too different (as Chuckie also tried dressing in a blue shirt and a diaper to be more like him), Stu tries to console him, only to discover that he doesn't have his diaper on and issue a code yellow.
    
    **Angelica:** Well, just goes to show you, you can take the baby out of the diaper, but you shouldn't.
    
-   In the 90's revival of _Secret Squirrel_, it is established in the episode "Voodoo Goat" that voodoo dolls only work when they are used with a personal belonging of the person they are made to resemble, and the Voodoo Goat gets his voodoo dolls of the Chief and Secret Squirrel to work by stealing the Chief's pipe and hair from Secret's tail. When Secret fights back using a voodoo doll of the Voodoo Goat, he gets the doll to work by stealthily swiping the Voodoo Goat's underwear, which results in the villain peeking under his loincloth and remarking that he thought it was drafty. Voodoo Goat presumably remains without underwear for the rest of the episode, as it is never brought up again.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   In "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming", Bart and Lisa get trapped in the Air Force base; Marge comforts herself with the thought that at least Bart is wearing clean underwear. Cut to a shot of his underwear still on his bed.
        
        **Bart:** Ahhh! Free and easy, Lis'! There's nothing like an unfurnished basement for pure comfort.
        
    -   Naturally, Groundskeeper Willie often goes commando, as evidenced by the "Basic Instinct" Legs-Crossing Parody in "Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part 2)" (much to the disgust of Chief Wiggum) as well as the scene when Bart pranks Willie by attaching balloons to his kilt (which disgusts the townspeople but leaves Willie unfazed).
        
        **Willie:** 'Tis not but what God gave me, you puritan pukes!
        
    -   In "Ned 'n' Edna's Blend", Homer, who is portraying Jesus in a Passion Play, is tied onto a cross that is lifted upright by several actors; Sideshow Mel looks up his robe, and he mutters "Looks like _someone_ didn't follow the underwear rule".
-   On the opposite end of the spectrum, the boy in _The Snowman_ changes out of his pajamas directly into his clothes without even a pair of Long Johns underneath. Most likely done for humorous effect.
-   In the _Total Drama World Tour_ episode "The Am-AH-Zon Race" the girls find a pair of X-ray glasses in Cody's pocket. Heather teasingly asks Gwen to use them and see what kind of underwear Cody is wearing. He's not.
    
    **Cody:** _\[blushing\]_ Heh-heh... who wears undies in the Amazon?  
    **Gwen:** _\[in confessional\]_ Everyone! _Everyone_ wears undies in the Amazon!
    
-   In _The Venture Brothers_ episode "Ice Station — Impossible!", Rusty confesses that he is not wearing underwear beneath the jumpsuit Professor Impossible gave him. When his shatters in the cold, this is proven true.
