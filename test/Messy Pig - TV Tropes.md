That _is_ mud, right?

_Always having dirt_

There's one thing most people know about pigs: they are messy as hell. In times past, in some rural 3rd-world areas, pigs would even consume the waste from the outhouse.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  This Animal Stereotype is so prominent, it lead to pigs being almost invariably portrayed as filthy dirt-lovers.

Actually, pigs are instinctively clean animals, but their habit of rooting the ground and rolling in whatever moisture is available creates messy results in confined spaces. Despite not having that much hair, pigs aren't able to sweat, meaning that they have to roll around in cool and damp places frequently to prevent themselves from suffering heatstroke. Also, thanks to their omnivorous instinct to probe and explore everything around them for traces of food, pigs love to make a mess by chewing things to bits and rooting around in the pieces. Rotten wood, sofa cushions, or especially straw are bound to wind up in a million tiny fragments when a pig can get at them. For a human observer, such behavior creates a strong impression of a messy, dirty, unhygienic animal.

There is also quite a common subversion of this trope: when the pig is obsessively clean, proper and hygienic, in a somewhat exaggerated way. Note that to count as a subversion, the pig shouldn't just be clean; tidiness should be one of the main defining traits of its personality.

There's also the so-called _Babe_ Syndrome: the tendency of city folk who have never seen a live pig in the flesh to think that pigs are small and cute and pink and make good pets. While pigs are very intelligent and can be trained to do tricks and such, the average barnyard porker isn't particularly cuddly. They can also weigh up to a few hundred pounds and occasionally be quite aggressive. There are a few breeds bred specifically as pets, such as pot-bellied pigs, but even these require specialized care that most people cannot meet.

For non-porcine characters who are messy as pigs, see The Pig-Pen. For another common pig-related trope, see Gluttonous Pig (and its Darker and Edgier subtrope, Fed to Pigs), along with Brainy Pig. For a trope related to boars, pigs' big and scary cousins, see Full-Boar Action. For pigs being figuratively dirty, see Perverted Pig. For domesticated pigs kept as pets, see Housepet Pig.

    Mythology & Religion 

-   Pigs are considered "unclean" animals \[for eating\] in Judaism and Islam. There are several theories for why:
    1.  The prohibition relates to the propensity of pigs to harbor trichinella worms, which cause painful muscle disease and can only be killed through thorough cooking, which (goes the theory) was not always possible in ancient times. Whether this is God protecting His people with His timeless wisdom or cultural wisdom being reinforced by (supposed) word of God is entirely a matter of faith. This theory, however, doesn't hold up to more-recent archaeological evidence.
    2.  The prohibition relates to the way of life of the Hebrews and Arabs. Both peoples originated in the desert and remained, for the most part, in arid climates, i.e. places where human vegetable food is scarce. Cattle, sheep, and goats do not eat human vegetable food, but pigs do; therefore, keeping pigs is wasteful and ought to be avoided. Contemporary scholars favor this theory.
    3.  The prohibition is to set Jews/Muslims apart from their neighbors. While this is likely for Judaism (a common theory goes that the point of _all_ Kashrut is to keep Jews separated from the Gentiles), it's less likely for Islam (which, for one thing, is a proselytizing religion, and for another thing, allows — even encourages — mixing with the other "Peoples of the Book"/monotheists).
    4.  The prohibition is basically inscrutable, because believers must obey God no matter what. This is a common position among rabbis and some Muslim scholars.
    5.  Pork goes bad more quickly than other meats, and when you live in a very hot climate, long before the advent of the refrigerator, avoiding pork is sound practice, especially as pigs offer few other products or services except garbage disposal.
    6.  This tradition can also be traced back to the Old Testament period of The Bible, notably the Book of Leviticus, which stated that several animals are considered unclean, including pig. This is abandoned in the New Testament, which states all foods to be edible and heavily condemns sects which forbids the consumption of some foods, notably in the Book of Timothy.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Sesame Street_: In Episode 3139, a pig stays at the Furry Arms hotel, and complains to Humphrey and Ingrid that he is checking out since their maid service stinks. When Humphrey tells the pig that the maid came to his hotel room every day to clean it, the pig tells him that that's exactly why he's checking out; he prefers for his hotel room to be a pigsty. While this is bad news for Humphrey and Ingrid since one of their customers is unsatisfied, it is good news for Gordon and Susan, since they need someplace to spend the night while their apartment is being painted, and they can move into the hotel room once the pig has moved out. After, of course, Benny moves out the pig's numerous carts' worth of luggage.

    Toys 

-   Inverted in the case of Hamo from _Gogo's Crazy Bones_. The character's bio says that he has a reputation for being dirty, but is obsessed with being clean.
-   Squishmallows: Reese the Pig loves playing in the mud, to the point of spring being her favorite season because the rain creates lots of mud puddles for her to play in.

    Video Games 

-   Pey'j, Jade's lovably obnoxious pig uncle from _Beyond Good & Evil_. He's the designated fount of lowbrow humor (such as powering his Jet-Boots with farts).
-   The Rashberry species in _Viva Piñata_. Their house is covered in mud, and eat rotten food. And when you cross-romance them with their polar opposite — the perfect, dainty Swanana — you get something completely different.
-   The villains of _Mother 3_ are based around pigs. They wear pig suits, their symbol is a pig snout, and their capital is even called "New Pork City". They're dirty because they wreak havok on the flora and fauna.
-   In the comic book included with _Hogs of War_, an early panel depicts a family of pigs at home before they have joined the army; the living room floor is covered with small piles of excrement. A later panel depicts the pigs about to parachute behind enemy lines; one of them says that he needs to use the toilet, but the sergeant says "You don't use the toilet! You're a pig! You do it on the floor and roll around in it! We all do!"
-   The Warrens of _Darkest Dungeon_ are filled with malicious man-sized pigs (and the occasional boar) living in their own filth and the remains of humans they've eaten. Justified in that they only physically resemble pigs; they are actually fleshy confines for creatures beyond understanding, who don't particularly care about their cleanliness.

    Western Animation 

-   As a pig, Pig from _Back at the Barnyard_ likes both himself and his stall dirty. In "Home Sweet Hole", after Otis accidentally destroys Pip's mouse hole and Pip keeps Otis up all night with his wild parties, Pip moves into Pig's stall, since Pig can sleep through anything. To thank Pig for being a wonderful host, Pip decides to clean his stall for him. Pig is horrified when he finds out about this, as it took him years to get it dirty, and he kicks Pip out.
-   Zigzagged Trope in _Creature Comforts_: the defining personality trait of one pig character is germophobia, but he's generally shown in a muddy sty and covered in swill, the comedy coming from the contrast to what he's saying.
-   Normally averted with Mabel's pet pig Waddles on _Gravity Falls_. However, when a "Freaky Friday" Flip swaps the minds of Soos and Waddles, Soos goes out and finds a mud puddle; "Do I dare live out the cliché?"

-   Generally averted in _Peppa Pig_, except for the Running Gag that "everyone likes jumping in muddy puddles".
-   _Rocko's Modern Life_: In "Unbalanced Load", Rocko sees all the dirty laundry in his bedroom and complains that the place is a pigsty. An angry pig eating pizza responds (in a distinct New Jersey accent) "You got a problem with that?" and is kicked out by Rocko.
-   _Tiny Toon Adventures_:
    -   Hamton J. Pig is an aversion, as he's actually a Neat Freak.
    -   His Uncle Stinky from the Summer Vacation Movie plays this trope straight.
-   _Total Drama_:
    -   A multistep dare Heather fulfills in "I Triple Dog Dare You!" is to have a bucket filled with pigsty mud dunked over her head. The bucket next serves as a helmet when she's loaded into a cannon and shot into the rest of the mud pile at pointblank range.
