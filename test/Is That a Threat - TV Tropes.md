_"Presidents don't threaten, Jack. They don't have to."_

When threatened, a character responds with, "Is that a threat?" or "Are you threatening me?" regardless of how poorly veiled the actual threat was. Stock answers include, "No, it's a fact", "No, it's a promise", and "Yes". A common variation is having the character asking "is that a threat or a promise?", and it's usually used as a form of Threat Backfire, when the threatened thing wouldn't inconvenience them, or even would benefit them.

If the threatened punishment is perceived as an Unishment or the threatened character is Too Kinky to Torture, the recipient of the ultimatum may reply, "Why must you tempt me so?"

    **Celestia:** No, I am not. I am simply stating a fact about your more-than-likely prison if you attack one of my nation's most beloved heroes for at least six hundred years, give or take our busy schedule to keep track of such things, \[...\] That is only if you prove to be a threat and as an immortal myself, I have a very _long_ memory.

-   _Broken Angels_. Matthias Hand (a Voodoo practitioner) implies there may supernatural retribution if any harm comes to him.

-   _Greg Mandel Trilogy_: Averted in _The Nano Flower_ by Peter F. Hamilton. Victor Tyo, chief of the security division of Event Horizon goes to talk to the head of their SETI project, and starts the conversation by reminding him of his confidentiality agreement.
    
    "I'm not interested in restricting the flow of ideas, I simply ask that our conversation is not bandied about."  
    "Otherwise I'm for the chop."  
    Victor sat back in the chair and gave Rick Parnell a searching look. "Tekmercs make threats, Mr. Director. I work on the other side of the fence. We try and ensure that a dedicated researcher's life's work isn't stolen from under their nose, that the pension fund you've paid into for forty years doesn't get emptied by some hotrod with a smart decryption program. Now, you and I are employed by the same lady, and she suggested I ask your professional advice on a matter I'm involved with. Is that really so hard for you?"

        **Vernon:** And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated?

-   _The Murderbot Diaries_
    -   In _Artificial Condition_, when Murderbot says it will rip out the tongue of the Corrupt Corporate Executive if she steps out of line, she suggests it come up with better threats. Murderbot replies, "I don't make threats. I'm just telling you what I'm going to do." This becomes an Ironic Echo in the following story when Murderbot finds itself up against combat bots who state they're going to tear them apart.
        
        I reminded myself a combat bot wasn't a human, it wasn't a villain from one of my shows. It was a bot, and it wasn't threatening us.  
        It was just telling us what it was going to do.
        
    -   In "Network Effect", when one of the humans complains that ART and Murderbot have killed all the alien-infected humans who attacked them, so they don't know anything about them, ART says they're free to put a corpse in the Auto Doc so he can cut it open for examination.

Phule tells him that he knows the owner of the chain personally, he needs some ready money, and he totally _can_ buy the hotel. But that wasn't a threat. Hoewever, since buying the hotel would take time and wouldn't solve the immediate problem, if Omega Company _can't_ stay at the hotel tonight, Phule will not only buy the hotel and sack the manager, but see to it that he can neither get employed anywhere else on the planet or book passage to somewhere else. _That's_ a threat.
-   Two examples in _A Song of Ice and Fire_.
    -   Ser Kevan Lannister warns his niece the Queen Regent not to take him lightly.

    -   In an earlier novel, Tyrion Lannister does something similar when he finds his nephew King Joffrey having Sansa Stark stripped and beaten in public.
        
        **King Joffrey:** The King can do as he likes!  
        **Tyrion:** The Mad King did as he liked. Did your uncle Jaime tell you what happened to him?  
        **Ser Meryn:** No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard!  
        **Tyrion:** I am not threatening the King, I am educating my nephew. Bronn, if Ser Meryn speaks again, kill him. See? That is a threat.
        
-   _Star Wars Legends_: _Vision of the Future_:

    _\[Disra draws his concealed blaster pistol\]_
    
-   _Warrior Cats_:
    
    **Skipper:** I've seen Red around a lot lately. Next time, it might be a tuft of her fur that's left beside a dead Twoleg pet.  
    **Stick:** Leave Red out of this. And don't make threats you can't keep.  
    **Misha:** Oh, they're not threats. They're promises.
    
-   _Winner Take All_, by Barry Eisler.
    
    I returned his stare, and something in my eyes made him look away. “If you want to play fishing games with me,” I said, “you’re just wasting time. But if I think your I-took-a-course-at-Langley\-on-verbal-manipulation-techniques bullshit contains an element of threat, I’ll take you out before you even have a chance to beg me not to.”
    
-   _Wolf Hall_:
    -   Thomas More, who is cracking down on Protestantism, tells Cromwell that he knows about Cromwell's correspondence with William Tyndale.
        
        **Cromwell:** Are you threatening me? I'm just interested.  
        **More:** _\[after a pause\]_ Yes... yes, that is precisely what I'm doing.
        
    -   When Thomas More resigns as Lord Chancellor, Thomas Cromwell asks what he's going to do with his retirement.
        
        **More:** Write. Pray.  
        **Cromwell:** My recommendation: write only a little, and pray a lot.  
        **More:** Now is that a threat?  
        **Cromwell:** My turn, don't you think?
        
-   _Worm_:
    -   A third-party variant:
        
        **Director Tagg:** And you don't care about your savior, locked away in that cell?  
        **Dinah Alcott:** Are you threatening Taylor?  
        **Director Tagg:** I don't know. You said she'll do damage in some form. Maybe we need to stop that from happening. And you said that no matter what happens, the outcome's more in our favor than it was before she surrendered. Why? Is it that important to remove her from Brockton Bay? To unseat her from her throne?  
        **Dinah Alcott:** I'm not answering any more questions.  
        **Director Tagg:** You'll answer what I ask you to answer, because we need to go into this with our eyes open. We can't have Skitter damage _us_.  
        **Mrs. Yamada:** Director, this isn't constructive. The last thing she wants—  
        **Dinah Alcott:** The last thing I want is another arrogant dickface telling me what to do. You want answers, Director? Fine. Twenty two point eight one three percent chance you die painfully, over long, slow minutes or hours. Maybe soon, maybe in twenty years, but it'll bring you to tears, and you'll wail in pain. That's a freebie. Want more details?
        
    -   Alexandria and Taylor have this little discussion in Cell 22.4. It later gets turned around, in the most gruesome manner.
        
        **Alexandria:** You wanted to be on board, I presume. You had to be informed, so you understood exactly what it means when I make a threat.  
        **Taylor:** You're planning to make threats?  
        **Alexandria:** Threats is the wrong word. But English is a limited language in some ways. There's really no word to articulate what I mean. A threat with a measure of inevitability to it. A promise? Too feeble. People break promises too often. A curse? A malediction? Too... magical. An oath? The connotations are wrong. When I say I'll do something, I make it happen.
