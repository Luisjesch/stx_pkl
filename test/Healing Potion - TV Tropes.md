So good it even fixed his cape.

_"Everybody knows if you find a first-aid kit with all its fuckin' hypodermic needles in the trash, first thing you should do is eat it!"_

When heroes are injured and have to heal themselves, the favored method is to quaff a Healing Potion. Typically this item is mostly used in Fantasy settings, but it can easily be adapted to other Speculative Fiction stories as a form of Applied Phlebotinum made of Nanomachines or whatnot. It can be as common as a Standard RPG Item, a one-of-a-kind MacGuffin, or somewhere in between.

Healing Potions are an old, _old_ trope. Many fairy tales, legends, and myths have a medicine woman or even goddess come to an ailing hero with a cup of Ambrosia, Dragon's Blood, or other magical elixir that reinvigorates the hero to continue their quest. It rarely ever has unpleasant side effects, but you never know. When Silver Has Mystic Powers, it makes a good way to brew and/or hold these.

Typically, it restores Hit Points depending on the quality of the potion. Some can bring back the (near) dead, and others will barely clot papercuts. Depending on its use in the plot it may even function as a one-time Healing Factor that can remove scars and regrow lost limbs. As an added bonus, lobbing one at a zombie is sure to harm it. Just don't ask where all the empty bottles go.

A staple of First-Person Shooter games on the classic end of the Fackler Scale of FPS Realism; more simulational shooters tend to go for Regenerating Health or more complicated first aid management. Roguelikes also tend to have them, and most of them have multiple types of varying potencies, with the more potent sometimes also being Anti-Debuff.

    Anime & Manga 

-   There's a version in _Agni's Philosophy_, which is surely a Mythology Gag to the _Final Fantasy_ series. The titular character, pursued and injured, grabs a soda bottle full of water and transforms it with magic into a healing potion. While this causes her wounds to heal, including the bullet to pop out of the bullet wound, it's clearly extremely painful for her.
-   The Senzu Beans in _Dragon Ball_ and its related series. They can heal any damage or injury, even to someone near death, as well as curing fatigue and restoring a fighter's ki. They were introduced as a special food, one bean supposed to be enough to feed a man for several days, although as the main characters are all Big Eaters, this is not quite the case in practice. They are also very difficult and time-consuming to grow, so the heroes usually never have more than a handful available at a time.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   _Golden Wind_: In the spin-off, _Golden Heart, Golden Ring_, Coniglio's The Cure can heal physical wounds, illness, and emotional distress.
    -   _JoJolion_: The Locacaca fruits are basically a Healing Potion that can cure any sort of aliment when consumed, but the person who eats the fruit undergoes Equivalent Exchange.
-   The Ixir that was given to Ako in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ when she found herself with a terrible disease in the Magical World. Unfortunately, it's also extremely expensive and she found herself and her friends enslaved in order to pay off her debt of 1,000,000 Dp.
-   _Overlord_: Healing potions are common around the world. Due to the vitality restored with the color they display, these elixirs are also considered to be God's Blood by citizens.
-   In _Rebuild World_, nanite medicine can be taken in the form of pills to heal wounds and stave off fatigue. It's considered essential for a hunter in order to stay alive in the field and avoid collapsing of exhaustion. Unfortunately, it's difficult to verify the quality of medicine, forcing hunters to take whatever they can get regardless of the side effects. Taking too much over a short period will also cause the nanites to go haywire, causing one to collapse into a several-day-long coma. Akira's life is saved numerous times by an extra powerful version from the Old World he found in the Kuzusuhara Ruins, but that runs out after his encounter with the cannon insects.

    Card Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_ life gaining effects occasionally take the form of potions or elixirs.

    Comic Books 

-   An alchemist in _Red Sonja_: _Queen of Plagues_ develops one, but is executed soon after. The potion is preserved and delivered to Sonja as she lies dying several issues later.
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: When Marya finds Wonder Woman with a head injury after her Robot Plane was sabotaged she mixes up a potion to help her heal and recover her memories. The potion is quite effective, but Marya prefers to defer to actual medical professionals.

    Fan Works 

-   _Jericho (MLP)_ deconstructs this trope. Healing work by re-appropriating biomass; if you drink them on an empty stomach (read: anything short of absolutely stuffed), they will kill by breaking down parts of your body to get the biomass to cure your wounds. Coupled with the narrator's habitual lack of eating, using one nearly murders him. Even professional Prussian soldiers don't like health potions because of this.
-   _Nine Days Down_: Panacea is a miracle healing salve that soothes pain, disinfects, seals wounds, boosts healing, and regrows hair. It is extremely potent but also extremely expensive to make, and as such is reserved for critical cases.
-   _The Ultimate Evil_: Shendu knows how to concoct a tonic that hastens one's healing process. He says that it's simple alchemy and easy to master. Uncle can also make it.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In the 2018 Dark Fantasy film _The Head Hunter 2018_, the protagonist keeps making a tincture made from dissolved monster parts. The protagonist smears the tincture on wounds he gets whenever he goes monster hunting and his wounds close overnight. This backfires on him when after successfully killing one monster, a jar of the tincture falls on the monster's decapitated head reviving it.
-   _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_. Water placed in the Holy Grail will heal the wounds of and even grant immortality to anyone who drinks it. If you want to nitpick, it was more of a "chalice that turns water into a healing potion" than a "healing potion", but the Joneses didn't want to look _that_ gift-templar in the mouth. Of course, the False Grail(s) had a different effect. The immortality effects also only work as long as you remain inside the temple where it's kept, so if you want to live forever, you won't be going anywhere else from now on.
-   _Macario_: Death himself gives Macario, a simple peasant, a gourd full of magic water. One drop of the magic water will heal the sick—unless, that is, the sick person is marked off by Death to die. The signal comes when Death appears at the bedside of the patient. If Death appears at the foot of the bed, Macario can administer his healing water, and the sick person will be well. If Death appears at the head of the bed, the sick person is a goner, and Macario's healing water won't work.

    Gamebooks 

-   While most heroes from the _Fighting Fantasy_ series relied on Health Food, there were some Healing Potions spread throughout the books. Mostly they just worked the same way as provisions did, healing 4 stamina points per dose. The more powerful Potion of Stamina however is a better example as it healed half your initial stamina points.
-   A staple of the _Lone Wolf_ gamebooks. The most common kind is the Laumspur potion, brewed from the Laumspur herb you can find over most of Magnamund. There are other varieties, more or less efficient, like Rendalim's elixir, Lanurma, Oxydine, Oede herb, etc. Very useful even with the Healing discipline, since it's quite easy to get mangled beyond what your Gradual Regeneration can quickly repair.

    Literature 

-   In _An Outcast in Another World_, they're simply called ‘HP Potions’, and they’re a staple of any Combat Class user in Elatra. Those who don’t keep them on hand tend to die, and every member of the cast has made liberal use of them when necessary – and needed Potions for themselves to stay alive.
-   Healing potions have limited use in _Almost Night_. They can heal blood loss easily enough, but can't bring back someone who has been ripped to pieces.
-   In _The Dark Profit Saga_ healing salves are effective but can be addictive. Kaitha, a "salve-head", regularly sneaks off to cut herself and heal it.
-   Parodied in _Don Quixote_. The eponymous character claims to have the recipe for an elixir that heals all wounds, but being who he is, it instead induces severe pain and vomiting.
-   In _The Elric Saga_, before the titular character finds the dread Black Sword Stormbringer, his life depends on regular supplies of healing and restorative potions. In the hands of the Big Bad, he is threatened with a lingering death in which _just enough_ of the healing potion is applied to him.
-   In _The Girl from the Miracles District_, Nikita regularly uses a foul-smelling potion that hastens mending of wounds and bones.
-   The cordial Father Christmas gives Lucy in _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_, which she uses throughout the rest of the series. Just a few drops can heal any wound or illness.
-   Deconstructed in a _Magic: The Gathering_ tie-in novel. The protagonist, being a cop who has frequently stated that he's getting too old for this, frequently uses Healing Potions after cases. This, coupled with his Alcoholic tendencies, have caused a dependency on quick healing that will eventually kill him.
-   _The Shahnameh_: Key Kavous is in possession of this but refuses to share it with Rostam when he sends Giv to get it for the mortally wounded Sohrab. Key Kavous's paranoia sets in and he fears that if Sohrab is healed he will go through with his oath to kill Kavous and usurp his throne and now that Rostam knows Sohrab is his son they will join forces! Granted this was actually Sohrab's intent, Key Kavous should have known that Rostam was too loyal to ever let it happen, especially after all Rostam had done for Kavous.
-   In Robert E. Howard's _Conan the Barbarian_ story "The Slithering Shadow", Xuthal has an amazing golden wine that cures and revives. It not only brings Natala and Conan back to health after being lost in the Thirsty Desert, it lets Conan easily shake off the wounds inflicted by an Eldritch Abomination Living Shadow.
-   _Guardians of the Flame_: Healing draughts are common and carried by people going into battle. Although they're not quite a panacea, they save many people across the series, including protagonists.
-   _Bazil Broketail_: Bazil loses the tip of his tail to a sore loser during a bout in the first book. Its regrown with a magical potion Lessis has made up, but juts out slightly, resulting in his "broketail" nickname.
-   _Villains by Necessity_: A shrine to Mula, goddess of healing and fresh water, has water with healing properties. Pilgrims come to be healed there. The protagonists also steam some to treat Valerie after she gets injured (being villains, they would be found out by the Good-aligned clergy of the shrine otherwise). Arcie saves a wineskin full of it which later also saves Sam from injuries which he suffers.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ is largely responsible for turning an uncommon myth into a staple of all fantasy games.
    -   Standard Fourth Edition healing potions are interesting in that, like many other healing effects in that version, they require the expenditure of a healing surge to work (which are normally spent "naturally" during short breaks in the action for the same reason) — and once your natural healing reserves for the day are used up, potions aren't going to do you any more good, either. Moreover, whereas hit points restored by spending a healing surge are normally a fraction of the character's uninjured total, the amount restored by a given potion is fixed and can thus be more or, more problematic, _less_ than what the drinker would normally get back. Additionally, most NPCs lack healing surges, and thus are completely incapable of ever healing (if they even had more than a single hit point in the first place).
    -   A Potion of Heroism gives you ten temporary hit points and makes you more resistant to damage for a set time.
    -   A Potion of Vitality cures physical exhaustion, disease, and poison, and maxes out your hit points as well.
    -   Older editions have an example of a non-magical healing potion: an expensive balm can be applied to a wound in order to heal less than three hit points. It's useful because, though expensive, it's often available for purchase when magical items are not.
-   _GURPS_: Health and Healing potions are very useful because healing spells are difficult to cast multiple times a day on someone.
-   _Hunter: The Vigil_: The Ascending Ones' Bennu-Bird Feather Elixir is a gooey paste made from a tail feather from a _Bennu_ bird, medical herbs, and opiates. If smeared over a wound, it greatly accelerates its healing.
-   _Warhammer_ has a healing potion available in its list of common magic items (available to all armies), which can be drunk at the start of any turn to restore D6 wounds to the character carrying it.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_:
    -   1<sup>st</sup>\-edition Potions of Healing are Magic Potions that restore wounds, cure poisons, and negate magical maladies. In subsequent editions, Healing Draughts only restore a limited number of wounds (and only work on lightly wounded creatures in 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition), but can be brewed by any herbalist.
    -   One magical item is the Red Bandage taken from the body of a miraculously healed patient, and so takes the color of the blood, sweat, pus, and other humors issued from the patient. It heals all wounds, but naturally such relics are hard to obtain and are easily the most faked magic item. Some counterfeits are taken from _plague victims_.

    Theatre 

-   In John Milton's _Comus_, Sabrina can work wonders with her "precious vialed liquors".

    Video Games 

-   _Afterimage_: Health Potions are consumable items that restore Renee's HP by a given amount depending on the potions' tiers. Naturally, bigger and rarer potions restore more HP.
-   In a Doujin JPRG called _Alshard_ (based on the table game of the same name) they have healing items in the form of crystals and berries which do percentage-based heals (10% of your health is healed by absorbing a crystal which is based on your current health while your health can also be healed by Healing Machines based on the amount of money you spend on it! So you pay 1000 credits you get 10% you pay 10,000 you get 100% healing!)
-   _ANNO: Mutationem_: The Corn Juice is an effective healing item that gives instant recovered health upon usage instead of the regenerative effect provided from Stim Shots.
-   In _Aquaman: Battle for Atlantis_ these come in three varieties. Gold symbols heal your life gauge, blue heals your energy gauge when using complex combos, and purple heals your block gauge when you block melee attacks.
-   The _Bayonetta_ series has the Green Herb lollipops to restore health, with the Mega Green Herb lollipops healing twice as much.
-   In _BioShock_, in addition to the medkits and food items, alcoholic drinks restore HP at the cost of Mana unless you took the Boozehound perk.
-   _Bound by Blades_ has healing potions as the default health restoration mechanic, obtainable by purchasing between stages.
-   _Castlevania_: Starting in _Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_, healing potions replace hidden-in-walls Roast Joints as the primary healing item.

-   _Dark Devotion_ has Poultices, which restore one pip of your health bar, and Pieces of Armor, which restore two pips of your armor bar.
-   _Dark Souls_ has Estus, stored in a jade flask, refilled at Bonfires, and your main method of healing. It's also the main method of healing for all Undead, and some of your Hollow foes will drink some when they're low on health.
-   _Deadly Towers_ had these in four colors: red, orange, green, and blue, in increasing amounts of healing.
-   _Demon Hunter: The Return of the Wings_: Gun can buy or craft different tiers of health or mana potions and assign them to the toolbar. There are also potions that refill both or remove debuffs.
-   _Diablo_ series plays it pretty straight for the most part, with potions of various sizes and proportionate expenses which heal specific amounts of health.
    -   In _Diablo III_ they put a cooldown on potions and make them rarer to prevent players from abusing them to stay alive. These were supplemented and eventually replaced with healing globes that have a chance to drop on killing an enemy and which heal for a fixed percentage of health.
        -   A patch eliminated normal healing potions and gave you a bottomless one that can be used every 30 seconds to restore 60% of your health. You can also collect legendary-class bottomless potions that add special effects for a few seconds.
    -   _Torchlight_, Spiritual Sequel made by the Artist Formerly Known as Blizzard North, keeps them. On the lighter difficulties, you _are_ effectively invincible with even a small stack of them, but in the harder ones, things get significantly rougher.
-   Oddly replaced in _Dragon Strike_, which was a game in the _Dragonlance_ setting for _Dungeons & Dragons_. Normally healing potions are a mainstay of D&D but in this game, you instead have a Keoghtom's Ointment for your knight and dragon. In the tabletop game, Keoghtom's Ointment has modest healing power but is an amazing curative for conditions like disease. But in this game, there's no disease or whatnot so the Keoghtom's Ointment is just a mid-level healing potion.
-   _Dishonored_ has Sokolov's Elixir which also has the function of protecting against the plague.
-   Present throughout _The Elder Scrolls_ series. Numerous other healing methods are available as well (spells, scrolls, enchantments), but in terms of effectiveness, affordability, ease of use, and item weight (potions the size of a 2-liter bottle of soda still only weigh half a pound), nothing beats a healing potion. It also helps that they are plentifully found throughout dungeons and nearly all non-specialized vendors sell a few to replenish your stock as well.
-   _The End Times: Vermintide_ and _Vermintide II_: Healing draughts instantly restore a flat amount of Hit Points, whereas medical supplies take a few seconds to use, restore 80% of missing HP, and can be used on another character. Each hero can carry only one healing item at a time; the rarity of the pickups depends on the difficulty level.
    
    **Victor Saltzypre:** Come, potion, lend me vigor!
    
-   Stimpaks in the _Fallout_ series of games. Although there are alternatives such as food, drink, and bloodpacks, a lot of these are also radioactive (and chock full of preservatives to remain edible after 200+ years).
-   The _Fatal Frame_ games have "Sacred Water", which fully restores the character's health. Given its healing capacity, its quantities are limited.
-   Potions are in every _Final Fantasy_ game except for _Revenant Wings_. In addition to the basic Potions, there are variants like the Hi-Potion (restores more HP), X-Potion (fully restores HP, or restores more than a Hi-Potion) and Mega-Potion (restores HP to all characters).
-   _Fire Emblem_ has vulneraries (which in most games heals a set amount of HP), which in Real Life are drugs for treating wounds; they appear in-game as flasks, though the games are unclear if the contents are rubbed onto the wound, drunk like a potion, or if both methods work. The all-HP-restoring Elixirs are a straighter example of this trope.
-   _Ghost of Tsushima Legends_:
    -   You can replace your defensive shinobi gear with a healing gourd. Standard gourds heal a quarter of your base HP, remove most status effects, and have a recharge time of 90 seconds. Also, the Ghost pours it over their head rather than drinking it; if it's alcohol, that doesn't explain why it cures burning.
    -   Kenji's Shared Brew is like a Mega-Potion; it also heals nearby enemies.
    -   Bottle of Liquid Courage only heals in the single-digits, but restores your special attack meter.
-   In _The Godfather: The Game_, you can pick up or buy bottles of RX that serve this function. In a subversion, unlike traditional potions it doesn't instantly restore your health to full, but you must wait some time for the health bar to refill, and enemies can interrupt the healing. Best to ensure there aren't any interruptions around.
-   If you look at it closely, a Medkit from _Half-Life 2_ contains a vial of green stuff that looks like this. In the _Episode_ expansions, you can also find "half medkits" consisting only of this vial.
-   _Half-Life: Alyx_ shows what the green stuff is — it's squeezed from antlion grubs. It's seen both in stationary healing stations (where activating the station squashes the grub) and in portable injectors.
-   Some of the _Halo_ games feature these in the form of health kits.
-   The first four _Harry Potter_ games had Chocolate Frogs that did this. _Chamber of Secrets_ also had Wiggenweld Potions, and _Goblet of Fire_ added red Bertie Bott's Beans, Cauldron Cakes, and Pumpkin Pasties.
-   _Heretic_ has the crystal vial, quartz flask, and mystic urn. The latter two can be picked up and carried to use later. The crystal vial restores 10% health, the quartz flask restores 25%, and the urn restores you to full health.
-   In _Holy Umbrella_, you can buy healing potions in several strengths, though you have to find the bottles to put them in elsewhere.
-   Tippsie from _Ittle Dew_ seems to be addicted to these. Although Ittle asks to have some in one dialogue sequence, they're not actually usable in the game.
-   Parodied in _Journey to the Savage Planet._ "Life Essence" comes in pods from large, orange flowers, but it doesn't actually heal you at all. It makes you "hallucinate" that you're less hurt than you really are.

-   _Left 4 Dead_:
    -   First-aid kits, which can provide health to yourself or your fellow survivors. However, you must hold still for a few seconds while you apply them. This can be risky at times during the Zombie Apocalypse.
    -   In addition to first-aid kits, there are also pain pills. They can be consumed instantly, but only offer a temporary boost in health. This can prove handy because your character starts to limp at low health and pills can be just what you need to hold yourself together until you can find shelter.
    -   The sequel adds adrenaline shots, which gives a temporary health boost and gives only half the amount that pills do, but you gain the ability to run faster, run through water without slowing down, common infected won't slow you down when they hit you, and all actions that require time to execute (such at using health kits) take half the time, which is extremely handy if you need to revive a survivor quickly.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_: Most games have a red healing potion, which recovers some or all of Link's hearts depending on the game. Other games add a green Mana Potion and a blue potion that heals both. Milk works like this in several games, it heals fewer hearts, but is cheaper and easier to get, making it a good alternative early on. Some games have other healing "potions", as well:
    -   _The Legend of Zelda_: The Life Potion refills your health bar when used. The blue kind can only be used once, while the red kind has two charges.
    -   _Zelda II: The Adventure of Link_: The Water of Life in an odd example in that you don't use it yourself, but instead fetch it to give to a woman who needs to heal her sick daughter.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_: The game introduces the classic trio of red, green and blue potions, which would reappear in the 3D _Zelda_ games until _The Wind Waker_ (the last game to feature the magic meter). The red one is an updated version of the original game's Life Potion (retaining the role of refilling your hearts), the green one refills your magic meter, and the blue one refills both.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening_: The Secret Medicine bought from Crazy Tracy works automatically, activating when Link runs out of hearts and refilling his health bar. Dialogue when you buy it implies it's not a potion but an unguent; the Switch remake altered its sprite to reflect this.
    -   In the Oracle Games, the Magic Potion works in the same way.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_: The Elixir Soup fully refills Link's health and magic, and also makes him more powerful until he gets hit again, has two helpings, _and_ isn't Too Awesome to Use as it can be easily replenished by talking to Link's grandma. The only drawback is that you can only carry one bottle of it at a time.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_ has a _bunch_ of them.
        -   Red potions can be purchased from shops.
        -   Milk heals three hearts.
        -   The Great Fairy's Tears. Much like _Wind Waker_'s Elixir Soup, except you can fill up as many bottles as you have; there's only one helping per bottle, though.
        -   Chu Jelly, which can be scooped up after killing Chus. Depending on the color, they can act as lantern oil (yellow), restore eight or all of Link's hearts (red and blue, respectively), make him _lose_ a heart (black), do nothing (green; it would likely have been used as a Mana Potion had the magic meter been kept in the game), act like the Great Fairy's Tears (rare), or be a Russian Roulette of sorts (purple).
        -   All kinds of soup. The Nasty Soup is Exactly What It Says on the Tin. You can scoop as much as you want for free, but you probably wouldn't want to, as like the Purple Chu Jelly it has a random chance of damaging Link. Yeto's soup is likewise free, and starts off Simple (restores two hearts). As you go through the Snowpeak Ruins and get him some more ingredients, it turns into the Good Soup (restores four hearts), then into the Superb Soup (restores eight hearts; basically a free red potion).
        -   Hot Spring Water. It's easy to obtain and replenishes all hearts, but useless in long journeys as it turns into regular, non-drinkable cold water after it cools down.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass_ and _Spirit Tracks_ have purple potion, another kind that automatically revives Link when he dies. There's also yellow potion, which completely refills Link's health.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_:
        -   Pumpkin Soup. It's normally used in a sidequest, but you can get some for yourself. It's cheap, but not as practical as a good ol' potion, though; it recovers eight hearts when hot, but it cools off after some time, and only restores four hearts then.
        -   Revitalizing potions' main use is to repair your shields, but they have the added bonus of healing some of your hearts as well.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ and _Tears of the Kingdom_ lets you recover health by eating a wide variety of realistic foods, but you can also brew various elixirs that function more like traditional potions. The basic hearty elixir is essentially a reskin of the older red potion, but also gives you temporary extra life; the fairy elixir simply refills part of your health bar.
-   In the _Max Payne_ games, the only way to increase Max's health is to take painkillers, so Max never actually _heals_ any of the damage he takes during the game, he simply ignores the pain of his accumulated wounds. One wonders how he feels the next day!
-   The _Mass Effect_ games have Medi-Gel, the universally useful wound treatment salve. It sterilizes the wound site and then immediately staunches the bleeding by congealing over it (and is removed for full treatment by ultrasound). It appears to be a genetically engineered organic material, as it's been deemed "technically illegal by Citadel law", but it's just so darn useful that everybody ignores that little technicality. Customized formulations are available for different species' anatomies.
-   The HP Bananas are _Miitopia_'s take on this trope. The HP Sprinkles also count, though they're used directly by the player instead of the Miis.
-   _Minecraft_ has the straight example of the trope with varying strengths of healing. You can also craft the splash version of the potion which heals anyone in its radius while also damaging to the undead. Adding a fermented spider's eye, which inverts a potion's effects, turns it into a potion of harming, which removes health from its imbiber or the person it's thrown at, while healing the undead.
-   The staple healing item in _Monster Hunter_. Available types include, from weakest to strongest, the basic Potion, Mega Potion, Max Potion, and Ancient Potion. Due to a rather tight limit on how many of each item you can have in your inventory, it may be worth taking a full stack of each type with you on a hunt
-   _NetHack_: Drinking one while at full health will increase your maximum Hit Points.
-   _Nitemare 3D_, being a game that takes place in a haunted house with witches and wands and the like, had literal health potions. Blue for 10% added health and red for 20.
-   In _Path of Exile,_ health flasks are reusable healing items that heal over time and fill up from enemy kills. There's also mana flasks for restoring mana and hybrid flasks that restore both. They can be enchanted to change how its healing works and what buffs they give while you're using one.
-   _PAYDAY: The Heist_:
    -   The first game has the Doctor Bag, a deployable item that can be used by the team which fully restores their health and resets their timer for bleedout (every knockdown reduces the timer).
    -   _PAYDAY 2_ has a redesigned doctor bag and a mini bag. The new doctor bags heal and restore knockdowns, which are now limited but have 30 seconds bleedout time. First aid kit sets have more healing charges, can be placed individually very quickly, and are consumed faster, which makes them great for a quick heal on the go, but do not reset the bleedouts.
    -   Doctor bags (renamed Medic Bags) and first aid kits return in _PAYDAY 3_. Doctor bags remain as deployables, but first-aid kits are instead scattered throughout the map.
-   In _Planet Explorers_, the herbal juice items fill this niche.
-   _Pokémon_: The various Potions are the series' primary healing item, coming in regular, Super, Hyper, and Max varieties — each refills more hit points; the Max kind completely restores the health bar — as well as the Full Restore which is also an Anti-Debuff. Unlike most examples, the Potions come in spray-bottle form and are applied to the Mons by their Trainer; it's even noted in-game that the Mons can't use man-made healing items, though they can hold on to a variety of Berries for similar effects.
-   _Prince of Persia_ has healing potions conveniently dotted around the palace, along with the occasional Poison Mushroom potion (distinguished by having blue bubbles rising from it instead of red) and Heart Container potion (distinguished by being taller).
-   The _Propagation_ series of games gives you disinfectant sprays, which heals damage inflicted on you.
-   _Ragnarok Online_ introduces potions with the basic Red Potion, followed by Yellow, Orange, and White, and then the Condensed versions that have increased efficiency. Eating certain fruits, herbs or foods also restores a minor amount of health. It is also possible to craft healing items using the aforementioned herbs and fruits, which is naturally the specialty of the Alchemist class...who can also invest in a skill that allows them to _chuck potions at allies to heal them_.
-   In _Remnant: From the Ashes_, while there's the Dragonheart relic which restores all your health, the alternative is a vial of Bloodroot. Bloodroot is a plant from Earth that grows even in areas under control by the Root. Bloodroot actively resists Root displacement of the ecosystem and humans have learnt to make an extract from it. A vial of Bloodroot will give you Gradual Regeneration over a span of time.
-   _Resident Evil_: There are the various herbs and healing sprays; First-Aid Sprays will restore your health fully while herbs have different healing properties depending on how you mixed them. The medicine from _Village_ is regenerative enough to glue a severed hand back on without loss of motor ability.
-   _RuneScape_ has the Saradomin Brew, a yellow potion which will restore a player's lifepoints, and is one of the few items that will boost lifepoints above their skill level defined maximum, but is has the drawback of each successive dose lowering the player's combat stats slightly.
-   One of the Occupations of _Ryzom_ involves going and collecting materials needed to create healing potions for characters. One potion is enough to restore a character to full health and give a temporary boost to their health regeneration speed.
-   _Serious Sam_ has small pink vials and larger green Erlenmeyer-style flasks. Not to mention the pills that give 1 health each and usually lead to a trap that spawns more enemies which will certainly cause more damage than you heal from picking up the pill.
-   In _Spud's Adventure_, Peppo the Pepper hangs around on dungeon floors with his Power Pepper potion, which restores your health once you talk to him.

-   _Sundered_ has Health Elixirs, which take the form of pulsating red orbs when dropped by enemies of from treasure containers. Eshe can only carry a limited supply of them and can spend Shards to increase both the amount of health they restore and the number of Health Elixirs she can carry at any given time.
-   _Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars_ has various drink-based items, such as Elixirs and KeroKeroColas, that can restore the party's HP and FP, alongside traditional Mario themed items like mushrooms.
-   _TaskMaker_: In addition to the traditional one, the game offers "Extra Healing" (a stronger potion), and various items that will restore your health and/or other stats to various degrees (including "Instant Weekend" and "Instant Vacation"). Eating Spinach also restores your stats. Most of this is also true of the sequel _The Tomb of the TaskMaker_, but with "Bucky's Famous Beef Stew" replacing the Spinach. The latter game also has a "Purple Pond Potion" which is more powerful than the healing scrolls.
-   _Temple of Apshai_ has salves that can be purchased from the Innkeeper and restore a small portion of your health. There are also elixirs, which are more potent and can only be found in the dungeons.
-   _Terraria_: These are your main source of healing. Consuming one instantly restores health, but also imposes a "Potion Sickness" debuff that disallows consuming another healing item for 60 seconds (or 45 seconds when equipped with a Philosopher's Stone). Also present are Mana Potions, which restore only Mana and have no cooldown, and Restoration Potions, which restore both health and mana but lack a "Greater" version.
    -   There are varieties of Health and Mana potions the player can brew at an Alchemy Station, The lower-end potions can be bought, taken from pots and chests, or found in the dungeon. Higher-end potions must be crafted or looted from Hardmode bosses in large quantities.
    -   Players can combine the lesser or standard kinds to make a restoration potion, which restore both life and mana at once.
    -   Jars of honey now grant healing.
    -   Honeyfins grant a straight 120 health per use. They're a decent alternative to normal Healing Potions until you start collecting the Greater version.
    -   Turkor the Ungrateful in the Mobile and 3DS versions can drop the Horn 'o' Plenty which is a single, infinite use item that heals 120 health like the Honeyfin. A _very_ helpful item all throughout Hardmode to save the Greater potions for boss fights.
-   _Thief: The Dark Project_: The manual lists "Healing potion: This does exactly what you think it does."

-   _Unhappy Ever After_: These take the form of things like "Healing Tonic", "Healing Preserve", and "Healing Slime".
-   _Unreal Tournament_ has vials of a sky-blue liquid. Whatever that stuff is, fair bet that the same stuff is inside a Big Keg O' Health.
-   You can make these in your forge to instantly heal your dragons after attacks in _War Dragons_ or occasionally get one while attacking an enemy base.
-   _Warcraft III_:
    -   Potions of Healing / Greater Healing restore large chunks of a hero's health. In the expansion, every faction can buy them from their item shop, but they now have a shared cooldown.
    -   Replenishment potions heal life and mana but do so over time, and if the hero takes damage the effect dissipates.
    -   Scrolls and Runes of Healing serve the same purpose, but heal all nearby allied units before disappearing.
    -   The Orcs used to be shafted with regards to healing, as their caster's (admittedly powerful) healing spell was only available at tier 3. The expansion gave them a hero with a healing spell and a Healing Salve, a potion that gradually restores a unit's health as long as they aren't in combat.
    -   One Night Elf mission ha an optional quest to fill a bottle with water from a Healing Spring to heal a bear-man shaman.
-   _The Witcher_ has a number of potions that instantly restore vitality and simpler ones that accelerate Geralt's normal healing rate. However, they're toxic to varying degrees, which requires an additional recovery period, and implied to be lethal to non-witchers.
-   _ZanZarah: The Hidden Portal_: There are three types of healing potions in the game that restore HP. There is also a Healing Herb that can revive defeated fairies and restore part of their health. All of them can only be used outside of combat.

    Web Comics 

-   Black Mage of _8-Bit Theater_ finds drinking the healing potions almost as bad as being wounded. They taste awful, like Coke. According to Red Mage, one does not have to drink the healing potion for it to take effect, as smashing glass bottle into the recipient's face works just as well.
-   _Awful Hospital_: Within the Biovessel, it's vials of mucus. Once back in the hospital, it's a concoction imported from same biovessel, created by Dr. Staph. They're part of the comic's riffing on video game elements, but are Justified in-universe as physical manifestations of the concept of "Health".
-   _Bar'd_: The Passion Of Tears Individual Open-wound Nullifier (or P.O.T.I.O.N) is one of the more popular drinks at the Leafy Bar. In addition to healing wounds, it also reverses the effects of most of the other beverages, including Cintreuse de Genre.
-   Are you from _Blank It_? Did you lose a hand? Grow it back with some handy "hand juice"! NOT recommended if you have NOT lost a hand. Also an unusual example because this seems to be the only kind of damage it heals.
-   Twins Hex and Mye, who are a necromancer and witch respectively, both brew healing potions in _Charby the Vampirate_ even though they possess a healing kiss. Hex in particular refuses to use his healing kiss and has informed even those few he considers friends that he wouldn't use it even if it was the only way to save their lives.

-   _Goblins_ has Minmax, Kin and Forgath finding an _entire river_ of healing potion in the Maze of Many. Unfortunately for them, at that point in the dungeon, the only way left for them to _carry_ any of it turns out to be Forgath's helmet.

-   _Slightly Damned_ has a five-piece magic potion set called the Rainbow Reverie which the green potion is one of these, it's potent enough that a small dose can save someone from the brink of death. It's also the only one of the five potions that works for demons (and presumably angels) without unintended side effects.
-   In _Yokoka's Quest_, Blinky pulls out a healing potion after Pinky and Inky are knocked out in one blow at the start of the fight against two tunnel dwellers.

    Web Original 

-   Discussed in _Cracked_ articles:
-   In _Guts and Sass: An Anti-Epic_ rethor is a kind of healing potion distilled from the blood of the shapeshifting Lridrisy that catalyzes an impossibly fast healing process. Raw Lridrisy blood also has this property, but it is not as strong until condensed into rethor.

    Western Animation 

-   In an episode of _American Dad!_, Roger uses a lotion to re-grow Stan's legs after they've been torn off by a polar bear. Of course Roger was the _cause_ of said incident, but he made it right in the end. However, it apparently takes a while for Stan's legs to grow back to full size, so he's stuck with a pair of tiny baby legs until then.

    Real Life 

-   At the beginning of the 20th Century, ALL the leading causes of death were from infectious disease, and medicine at the time had a limited repertoire of responses. Then came antibiotics, penicillin in particular; The Other Wiki states is thus: "The purified antibiotic displayed antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria. It also had low toxicity and could be taken without causing adverse effects. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic antibiotic class available at the time the sulfonamides. The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented."
-   Many healing drinks and salves are mentioned in the Renaissance-era text, "Culpeper's Complete Herbal". While not as fast or flashy as their fictional counterparts, the plants involved (blackberry and clown's woundwort, to name two) have been found to contain a chemical that speeds up cell replacement.
