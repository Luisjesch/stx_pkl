"I'm gonna be a hero just like him!"

**Bruce Wayne:** As a kid I used to watch you with my father. The Gray Ghost was my hero.  
**Gray Ghost:** Really?  
**Bruce:** And he still is.

This is someone who the hero deeply admires, and who pushes them towards some ambition or aspiration, directly or not.

The hero's idol pushes the hero towards, if not a tangible goal, some version of themselves that brings out the best of them. It could be a superhero that inspires them to do good, a total badass that makes them work to be cooler, even just a humble citizen that showcases remarkable virtues.

The hero often devolves into a huge, geeky fan around their idols or is otherwise extra respectful around them. They might copy bits of their attitude, fashion sense, and philosophies. They could even base their moves and fighting style off the idol's.

The hero might not know their idol in person, but if they do, the idol could become anything from a mentor, a respecting ally, or even do something completely deplorable and make the hero lose all respect for them.

Watching this character die, especially after one final heroic act, will almost certainly break the hero's heart.

This character is the target of a Hero-Worshipper and likely a bestower of The Idol's Blessing. Hero's Muse is a related trope.
