_"Staring contest! You lose!"_

A Stock Superpower (and also a classic Super Robot weapon) that allows characters to shoot blasts out of their eyes. Blasts of what, you ask? Sometimes the generic, all-encompassing term of "energy." Sometimes "heat," in which case it is (logically) known as Heat Vision. Sometimes "lasers," in which case it is known (again, with excessive logic) as Laser Vision. The point is, they hurt. These are the _real_ Glowing Eyes of Doom.

This is the stock power of the Mecha Mook and those with powers beyond mortal men. Also, a stock joke about "laser eye surgery" fad.

Seldom is it explained how a beam which can burn or injure just about anything else is contained when trapped behind the character's eye_lids_, nor how the beam-producing mechanism within the eye avoids obstructing the vision of the actual seeing parts of the eye.

Compare X-Ray Vision, Deadly Gaze, Magical Eye, Breath Weapon, Head Blast, Hand Blast, and Psi Blast. Often The Glasses Come Off for this. A favorite attack for the Oculothorax. Not to be confused with I-beams, the architectural element, although those too can be used as weapons.

-   _The Last Daughter_: Taylor discovers that she can shoot heat blasts from her eyes during her fight with Behemoth.
-   _Neither a Bird nor a Plane, it's Deku!_: Izuku is Kryptonian, with the Heat Vision to match.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Incredibles_:
    -   The first movie features an eye-blasting hero named GazerBeam. He's already been murdered by the villain Syndrome by the time the main plot of the movie begins. He uses the power to leave an important clue: the password to the computer in Syndrome's lair.
    -   Baby Jack-Jack starts manifesting these during his Day in the Limelight short film _Jack-Jack Attack_. The rest of the family learn he has this ability, among many others, during the sequel. During the climax Violet picks Jack-Jack up and basically uses him as a gun to shoot one of their enemies by shouting "Pew Pew" to get Jack-Jack to fire his beams.
-   _The Iron Giant_: The titular character involuntarily deploys these if someone shoots at it, even if it's only with a toy gun.
-   _Megamind_: After Hal gets empowered and becomes Tighten, he uses these to _write his alias across the city_. He also uses them against a mannequin of Megamind.
-   _Monsters, Inc._: A witness credits Boo with "laser vision" that she used to blast a car.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Brandon from _Brightburn_, in addition to the other powers of the Superman package, also has laser eyes. But given that this kid is a supervillain, and that this is a horror flick, he puts this power to very horrific use on his father after he tries to shoot him.
-   Gort from the original _The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)._
-   DC Extended Universe:
    -   In _Man of Steel_, Superman's heat vision blasts look more focused than Zod's, presumably because Superman has had more time to master it. Both of them seem to find the ability painful to switch on and off.
    -   In _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_, Doomsday has eye beams, presumably because he was created from Zod's corpse. This allows him and Superman to have a brief but _awesome_ Beam-O-War.
    -   In _Zack Snyder's Justice League_, Alfred Pennyworth reverse-engineered Kryptonian tech to make Batman's gauntlets plasma-proof, which ends up being very useful when an angry revived Superman targets the Dark Knight with his eye beams. In the Final Battle, Superman uses his eye beams to cut off one of Steppenwolf's horns. In the final scenes showing how the Bad Future started, Darkseid uses his Omega Beams to kill some Atlanteans.
-   Also found in the world of _daikaiju_ (giant monsters), such as _Godzilla_ foes Battra, Mechagodzilla, and Gigan.
    -   Gigan is a special case as he never had eye beams in his first two appearances (He did have a laser weapon in his forehead that was never used) but the games give Gigan one despite that. Gigan's first film eye beam attack was in the Millennium era film _Godzilla: Final Wars_, where it was a short range attack called "Cluster Light Beam" and caused a explosion as the beams split apart, like a cluster bomb. In the _Pipeworks ''Godzilla'' Trilogy_, Gigan has both a long range beam and short range "shotgun blast".
    -   In Toho's fantasy adventure film _Yamato Takeru_ eye beams are a powerful weapon used by both the titular hero and his foe the Physical God Tsukuyomi. When the latter is in his Scaled Up Orochi form he can even shoot lightning bolts from his (many) eyes.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   The Marvel movies also give us _Thor._ The Destroyer armor opens its mask to reveal an empty helmet, and you can see the inside of the empty suit glowing like a furnace. Whenever this happens, this means a massive beam of KABLOOEY is about to be unleashed. Though it does stretch the definition of the 'eye' portion of the trope a little.
    -   This is one of Ikaris' powers in _Eternals_, and he is considered by several of the other Eternals as the most powerful among them.
-   In the scene where Skeletor becomes a god in _Masters of the Universe_, he forces He-Man to kneel before him by way of powerful Agony Beams fired from his eyes.
    
    **Skeletor:** Now...you will...**KNEEEEEEEEEEEL!**
    
-   _Star Trek V: The Final Frontier_. After Captain Kirk and Spock question the authenticity of "God", he fires beams of energy out of his eyes at them. He does it again while pursuing Kirk later on.
-   Kryptonians have heat vision in the _Superman_:
    -   A minor plotpoint in _Superman II_ was Non making multiple attempts to learn to control his heat vision.
    -   One of the most infamous cases of New Powers as the Plot Demands has Superman shooting beams from his eyes that repair the Great Wall Of China in _Superman IV: The Quest for Peace_. Word of God says he was supposed to fix it at Super-Speed but they were running out of money.
-   The 1985 shot-in-the-Philippines post-apocalyptic film _Warriors of the Apocalypse_ features a duel between two characters with this power.
-   When the Grand High Witch destroys a fellow witch for daring to argue with her in _The Witches (1990)_, this is the form her magical incineration attack takes.
-   _X-Men Film Series_
    -   When Cyclops' eyes are uncovered they shoot red beams uncontrollably. As mentioned in the comics, they shoot beams of pure concussive force and not heat, but this can be forgotten Depending on the Writer or Depending on the Artist. Specifically, _X-Men Origins: Wolverine_ leaves the edges of whatever he just blasted his way through glowing red-hot.
    -   In _X-Men: Days of Future Past_, the Future Sentinel's entire face unfolds to fire a powerful beam.

    Gamebooks 

-   In the _Sorcery!_ series, Red-Eyes are a race of lanky humanoids whose eyes are constantly closed. That's because when they open them, they can shoot fiery beams that are quite deadly. Having such a lethal weapon at their disposal has made all of them conceited bullies.

    Literature 

-   _Chrysalis (RinoZ)_: Invidia the envy demon has a single eye laser (green, naturally), which makes sense, as he's a single floating eyeball. It's extremely destructive, but he needs time to recover afterward, and it's unsafe to use in enclosed spaces.
-   In one of the oldest examples: the One Hundred Eyed Demon Lord from _Journey to the West_ emits hot beams of light from the various eyes located on his body. Sun Wukong manages to escape this light trap by turning into a pangolin and digging his way out.
    -   Even before that, when Wukong is born from the stone, he bows to the four cardinal directions and then accidentally shoots lasers out of his eyes that nearly hit the Jade Emperor himself.
-   The unnamed Culture terror weapon briefly followed at the end of _Look to Windward_, a Do-Anything Robot made from a nanomachine swarm can form pretty much any weapon it wants from its body, but isn't anywhere near as limited as the T-1000. It adjusts its eyes to lase in order to blind an opponent, but only in order to kill him in a more unpleasant way; this being Culture super science, it could have easily formed a Wave-Motion Gun had the need arisen.
-   In Roger Zelazny's _Lord of Light_, the mutant power of at least two of the "gods" — Yama and Kali — focused through the eyes. It was described poetically as "drinking life" with their eyes ... and if you actually _met_ the death-gaze with your own eyes, it was particularly powerful.
-   Don't get into a staring contest with Alex from _The Other Kind of Roommate_. Although his beams are invisible, so long as he's made direct eye contact, he can kill from streets away.
-   In _Paradise Lost_, the Son of God uses all of his eyes to glare lightning and fire at the demonic soldiers with such intensity that all their strength and life is lost to them.
-   In _The Plot of the Black Mass_ by Andrei Belyanin, Baba Yaga (a witch-like good character) uses Heat Beams from her eyes to kill an evil Catholic priest, who was attempting to summon Beelzebub.
-   The _Star Wars_ novel _Queen of the Empire_ had a human replica droid (essentially a Robot Girl), who impersonated Leia Organa and actually killed a villain with laser beams from her eyes.
-   _Skulduggery Pleasant: Playing with Fire_. Baron Vengeous has a glare which causes the recipient to explode.
-   In John French's _Warhammer 40,000_ _Thousand Sons_ trilogy, powerful sorcerers like Ahriman and Amon can emit white-hot beams of supernatural fire from their eyes.
-   _What Fire Cannot Burn_ uses this trope mostly straight for a minor villain, but mocks a surprising aspect of it. According to the narration, eye beams that are powerful enough to hurt somebody should be at a frequency invisible to the human eye—so unlike in the comic books, you don't see the blast, you just see what it does to people.
-   In the _Zachary Nixon Johnson_ series, there is a psi named Liz Lazor who specializes in firing lasers from her eyes.

-   Isaac Asimov's _The Bicentennial Man and Other Stories_: For some unknown reason, the 1978 Panther cover features an enormous six-limbed robot in water, blasting a damaged triangular plane with beams from the "head" of the robot, spaced so that they look like eyes.
-   _The Six Servants_: One of the servants is a man who can fire destructive beams from his eyes, and thus must go around in a blindfold so he doesn't accidentally destroy everything he looks at.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Arrowverse_:
    -   Jake Simmons (a.k.a. Deathbolt) shoots plasma laser beams from his eyes as his main power.
    -   _Supergirl (2015)_ as usual keeps the heat vision as part of the standard Kryptonian superpowers, although in this series it appears more blue/cyan than the traditional red from the comics and most other incarnations.
        -   In this series, the over-use of heat vision, which Clark terms a "solar-flare", can temporarily "burn-out" her or Clark's super-powers, temporarily causing them to revert to human.
-   _The Boys (2019)_:
    -   Billy Butcher finds a baby hooked up to an IV of Compound V being kept inside a laser-proof incubator, due to having been born with the ability to shoot blue beams from its eyes. Several mooks with automatic weapons then burst into the room, and in a classic _Boys_ Black Comedy moment, Butcher picks up the baby and uses it to blast them in half.
    -   Homelander's red eye beams are his most common weapons, which he uses to kill a building full of terrorists and bring down a plane. The reason he uses them is because they require the least effort for him to use and because he is frankly lazy, which fits with his characterization as a truly villainous Smug Super.
    -   In Season 3, after taking Temp-V to take down Homelander, Butcher gains his own orange-colored eye beams which he uses in a Beam-O-War.
-   The villain from the _Charmed (1998)_ episode "The Truth is out there, and it hurts" has a Third Eye that sends out a beam of burning energy. It targets the same area that the victim's third eye would be.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Silurians from the classic series had a Third Eye they could send an eye beam from which could kill, stun, or operate machinery.
    -   "42" has the bad guy running around with these (beams of heat, in this case), with a visor that seems to be a direct Shout-Out to Cyclops.
-   The villains of the week in the _Farscape_ episode "Crackers Don't Matter" is a blind Mad Scientist specializing in light, so naturally, he can shoot lasers out of his eyes. And cling to walls.
-   Although _Heroes_, surprisingly given the many different superpowers, does not have any characters with eye beams, in the season 3 episode "It's Coming", Elle shoots Sylar with so much lightning at one point that lightning actually _comes out of his eyes_ while he's being electrocuted. Good Thing He Can Heal.
-   On _How I Met Your Mother_, Lily has the "You're dead to me look", which causes her eyes to glow and the object of her glare to (appear to) vaporize. Given the look's similarity to Dark Willow eyes, this is possibly an Actor Allusion to actress Alyson Hannigan's former character.
-   The short lived comedy show _The Idiot Box_ featured a bit called "Damn These Eyes", about a scientist who, after a telescope mishap, was cursed with Eye Beams that he could not turn off. The beams — actually dotted lines — did not actually do anything, but they would let anyone know exactly where he was looking (such as at a woman's chest), destroying his life.
-   _Lab Rats_ has this as one of Adam's main bionic abilities. Usually it's the standard red laser beams, but there have been instances of him shooting actual fire out of his eyes, one of the most notable being in the first episode, when he uses it to ward off Mission Creek High's school mascot after it gets too clingy.
-   _The Mr. Potato Head Show_: During the superhero episode, Mr. Potato Head's "Spudman" character has the ability to fire lightning-like purple rays from his eyes; he used them to create a Bullethole Door to enter the villain's lair. He showed this ability once backstage, too.
-   Cindy Crawford was able to do this when she appeared on _Muppets Tonight_, and did it to vaporize two rather annoying Muppets, one a Loony Fan who asked if supermodels had super-powers, and during the last scene on a guy who kept introducing himself (over and over).
-   _Night Man_'s costume includes (among things like a bulletproof bodysuit, an Anti-Gravity belt, and an Invisibility Cloak) an eyepatch of sorts that grants him night vision and can fire a laser. He's not shy about using it to kill, though. At one point, he uses it to merely stun a bad guy, knowing the guy was going to take a two-story fall headfirst.
-   _Red Dwarf_: Rimmer contracts a holovirus in the episode "Quarantine", it drives him mad(der), and he puts on a red and white checked gingham dress, army boots and a penguin puppet, Mr. Flibble. The holovirus gives Rimmer Hex-Vision, with which he can shoot beams from his eyes. He can also transfer the Hex-Vision to Mr. Flibble...
    
    **Rimmer:** Mr. Flibble is very cross... you shouldn't have run away from him... what are we gonna do with them Mr. Flibble?  
    _\[Mr. Flibble, quivering with rage, whispers something in evil Rimmer's ear\]_  
    **Rimmer:** _\[shocked\]_ We can't do that... who'd clean up the mess? _\[both their eyes glow red\]_
    
    -   The first time our heroes get shot at with the Hex-Vision, the Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy trope is lampshaded. Fridge Brilliance would suggest the reason the bad guys can't shoot straight while using Eye Beams is because their optic nerves are overloaded by the energy needed to destroy their target, so they can't see a thing.
-   Olly, from _The Sifl and Olly Show_, has a pair of these installed at one point. They come with the ability to read minds. Side effects include extreme curiosity.
-   In one of the later _The Six Million Dollar Man_ made-for-TV movies, Steve Austin's long lost son suffers a tragic accident and gets a bionic eye — that can shoot lasers.
-   _Smallville_: Clark Kent, obviously. He develops them in "Heat". Also Bizarro, Ultraman, and any of the dozens of Kryptonians that pop up during the show. Heat vision is invisible to the naked eye and the beam effects are only for the audience's benefit, allowing them to use it in public without anyone noticing. And for the Kryptonians, heat vision is heavily associated with sexual arousal, with some of them activating it by accident when becoming too aroused.
-   Countless _Ultra Series_ kaiju possess beam attacks fired from their eyes.

    Music 

-   _Ok Go_ song **Invincible** have this in lyrics:
    
    _When they finally come to destroy the Earth_  
    _They'll have to deal with you first_  
    _And now, my money says they won't know about_  
    _The thousand Fahrenheit hot metal lights behind your eyes_
    
-   "CNR" by "Weird Al" Yankovic includes the lyric:
    
    _Ninja warrior, master of disguise_  
    _He could melt your brain with his laser beam eyes_  
    _Oh yeah_  
    _Oh yeah_
    
    -   Weird Al also offers "Slime Creatures from Outer Space:"
        
        _They'll zap you with their death ray eyes/and blow you up real good_
        
-   This was one of Paul Stanley's powers in their TV movie, _KISS Meets The Phantom Of The Park_.
    -   Afterwards, the band spent $250,000 trying to come up with a way for Paul to appear to shoot laser beams from his eye during their concerts.
    -   Ace Frehley is shown with these on the cover of _Rock And Roll Over_.
-   In the music video for "Radioactive" by Imagine Dragons has the teddy bear, after defeating the champion vaporize two of the boss's Mooks with its eyes.
-   In _They Might Be Giants_ "The Lady and the Tiger", the Lady from Frank Stockton's "The Lady, or the Tiger?" claims to have laser eyes that she plans to use to escape, but the Tiger doesn't think that's such a good idea:
    
    The Lady said "I'm busting out of this prison,  
    I got laser vision  
    And I'm burning a hole in the wall!"  
    The Tiger said "Wait, you'll start a fire  
    Destroy the entire  
    Lady and the Tiger hall!"
    
-   The surreal music video for Hot Chip's single "I Feel Better" - which already features an angelic figure with a Breath Weapon - also ends with the floating head of a black man who can fire lasers from his eyes, who uses this power to kill off the parody boy band Hot Chip's portrayed as, the _actual_ members of Hot Chip, and a few audience members before destroying the stage itself.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Buddha (yes, the founder of Buddhism himself) was said, after being denied access to the scrolls at a temple, to have sat down and stared at the wall until a hole was burned into it. The monks caved in and gave him full access after that. Considering the realism in most of Buddha's stories, this stands out quite a bit, although it's nothing compared to most of too-Anime-for\-_Goku_ higher mythology.
-   Older Than Print: Before the Tuatha De Danaan moved into Ireland in Celtic Mythology, the giant Fomor were led by Balor of the One Eye, whose deadly gaze could burn men "like leaves cast into a forge." When Balor was slain by his grandson Lugh, he fell face first to the ground with his eye still open, and burned a hole into the ground. It's still there today, as a lake.
    -   Another version of the above myth has Balor's eye bashed out the back of his head, casting its deadly gaze on his own army. Needless to say, they didn't win.
-   Shiva got an extra eye when gods tried to make him stop mourning for Sati and marry Parvati (he didn't know she was the reincarnation of his ex-wife, and no one thought to tell him). He opened his two eyes, noticed her, the god of lust Kama shot Shiva with a bow to stir up passion in him (sounds familiar?)... and then the plan backfired: to everyone's surprise he opened a _third_ eye and incinerated Kama with an eyebeam (Parvati found another way to become his wife and asked him to resurrect Kama). Scorching gaze of annoyed ascetics is a recurring motif for Hinduism, but mortals' anatomy doesn't change.
-   From Guarani mythology, Teju Jagua, a mix of a dog and a lizard with seven heads that guards caverns and fruits that's feared for his "_Fiery Gaze_". Essentially, a kind of South-American dragon. Fortunately, Teju Jagua is pretty friendly and tame compared to his siblings thanks to Tupã.
-   The basilisk was held to have eye beams of _pure death_, causing instantaneous death to any caught in its gaze. Another take on the myth is that the victim is betrayed by their own vision, and dies when they behold the creature. Still others hold a combination of the two, and eye contact between monster and victim is required.
-   In Classical Mythology the gaze of a witch could cause some harm or bad luck, but Medea, as granddaughter of Helios, could turn it up to Agony Beam level, driving the unkillable bronze giant Talos to suicide for his unprovoked attack on the Argonauts and herself (at least in one version. In the other she simply hypnotized him into suicide). One wonders why Jason, knowing her unstable character, thought he could get away with breaking up and trying to keep her away from their children...
-   Medjed, a very obscure deity in the Egyptian Mythology (he's only mentioned twice in the Book of Dead), is said to be able to shoot rays of light from his eye.

    Pinballs 

-   Cyclops is shown using his in _Stern Pinball's_ _X-Men_.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Arduin_: A number of Greater Demons can do this.
    -   Iphang, the Lord of the Yellow Horde, can fire a brilliant green ray of intense heat from his eye that does 3-60 Hit Points of damage to anything it hits. It has a range of 100 yards and can be fired up once per melee round up to 13 times in a row. After that it can only be fired once per minute until he doesn't use it (allowing it to rest) for 30 minutes.
    -   Karong the Lord of Slime has three large glowing eyes colored red, yellow and green. Once each melee round each eye can send out a beam of its color that is 40 yards long and 5 feet wide. The red ray causes 17-36 Hit Points of burning damage, the yellow ray causes 15-24 Hit Points of immediate rotting damage and 3 Hit Points of continuing rotting damage each melee round thereafter, and the green ray causes paralysis for 1-20 minutes.
-   _BattleTech_: BattleMechs with head mounted weapons sometimes have it set up as an eye-beam. The _Atlas_, which has a skull for a cockpit, can mount a laser in one of the eyes (the other is occupied by the actual pilot), and the Mechwarrior 4 _Cyclops_ has a huge glowing red "eye" where a head should be. You can mount a (light) Particle Projector Cannon there, making it fire _lightning bolts_
-   _Champions_ has a villain named Occulon who has several eye-based powers.
-   _Chaosium_: The supplement _All the Worlds' Monsters_ Volume III includes two creatures that can do this:
    -   The Shock Troll has two eyes. The grey eye can fire a death ray and the light green eye can fire a _Dungeons & Dragons_ Feeblemind spell.
    -   The Windwalker's gaze causes any creature it looks at to become confused.
-   _deadEarth_ features a variant of this among its (many, _many_) "Radiation Manipulations", "441: Halogen", which gives the character "the ability to project a variably bright light from \[their\] eyes", or in other words, flashlight eyes.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The beholder is a living embodiment of this trope with its _eleven_ eyes armed with magic rays, each of which acts as a different magical spell, a trait shared with the various beholder-kin creatures. There are also lots of creatures with gaze attacks affecting those meeting their eye, such as basilisks (petrification), catoblepas (death) and vampires (charm).
    -   Gibbering orbs can produce beams that, in a similar manner to beholders, emulate the effect of a high-level spell. Because gibbering orbs have hundreds of eyes, these beams aren't mapped to a specific eye; rather, the orb can essentially pick and choose which beams it wants to use from a set list of two dozen effects, with the only limitation being that it can only fire off one of each kind per round.
    -   In lieu of a conventional Breath Weapon like other dragons, a jabberwock can shoot a long line of fire from its bulging eyes unless it has been blinded by something.
    -   A handful of arcane spells like _eyebite_ (a gaze attacks with minor enchantments like charm or fear) and _dead man's eyes_ (the caster's eyeballs turn black with white skull-shaped pupils and kills people by looking in their eyes).
    -   Later sourcebooks provide a metamagic feat that allows player characters to store ray spells in each eye for convenient simultaneous blasting for a later date.
    -   The spell _lantern light_ from the 3E _Book of Exalted Deeds_ supplement gives clerics and paladins the ability to shoot eye beams.
    -   The obscenely powerful epic spell _vengeful gaze of god_ from the 3E _Epic Level Handbook_ deals anywhere from _305 to 1850 points of damage_, the latter value being easily sufficient to kill most _deities_ in one shot, and it has a range just less than two and a half _miles_. Of course, the massive backlash will likely kill you too. And by the time you're high enough level that you could conceivably cast it, you've got easier and safer ways to accomplish the same effect.
    -   1st Edition _Advanced D&D_ supplement _Fiend Folio_: The retriever has four eyes that can fire rays up to sixty feet away. Three of them inflict fire, cold and lightning damage (respectively) equal to the retriever's current Hit Points, with a saving throw vs. dragon breath for half damage. The fourth eye can transmute the target into mud, stone, gold or lead (determined randomly).
    -   _Critical Role: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting_: The Cinderslag Elemental has a form of heat vision that not only burns whoever it gazes it at, but also causes one of their possessions to either melt away or turn to ash.
    -   _Dragon_ magazine #46 adventure "The Temple of Poseidon": Once per minute, the Dark King Ythog-Nthlei can fire four scintillating beams of energy from his eyes that drain Strength from the victim.
    -   _Forgotten Realms_:
        -   _Dwarves Deep_ has the dwarven priestly spell _fire eyes_. _Seven Sisters_ adds its arcane counterpart — higher-level more powerful, but short-ranged and with bonus heat protection — and _basilisk glare_.
        -   The 3.5E supplement _Lost Empires of Faerûn_ gives the sunmaster Prestige Class the ability to shoot beams of light out of their eyes at 2nd level.
    -   _Ravenloft_: The "Realm of Terror" booklet, from the 2nd Edition boxed set, has it so that when someone fails a Ravenloft Powers check, one possible benefit is being able to fire a _ray of enfeeblement_ spell from their eyes three times per day.
-   _Exalted_: Shards of the Exalted Dream has the Empyreal Chaos Charm known as _Apocalypse Comet Gaze_. This allows Infern- er, _Titanic_ Exalts to, surprise surprise, fire death rays with a glare.
-   _GURPS_: "Lightning Stare" from _GURPS: Magic_, which probably isn't a cool as it sounds since you have to make "certain facial motions" in order to cast the spell.
-   _Pathfinder_ has the _yai-mimic spell_ metamagic feat, which allows a caster to cast any ray spell — that is, a spell which fires a magical beam from the hand or fingers — from the center of their forehead, where their Third Eye would be.
-   _Sentinels of the Multiverse_: This is Young Legacy's contribution to the Legacy superpowers, as seen on the Legacy card "Next Evolution". As a character card, it's her base power, "Atomic Glare".
-   _Shadowrun_: Cybereyes with built in lasers (or projectile weapons) are available. But, it is made very clear that they are very ineffective, especially in combat. In fact, the only effective use is low end tool uses. One alternative, however, is single-use flashbulbs - it won't _kill_ the victims, but rendering them temporarily blind is just as useful.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Commissar Sebastian Yarrick got a laser-firing bionic implant for his left eye to build on the stories fearful Orks told of him being able to kill with a glare.
    -   Prince Yriel has a similar item. No such cool backstory behind it, unfortunately.
    -   Lords of Change, the greater daemons of Tzeentch, use their gaze as their ranged attack.
    -   One of the psychic powers available to the Ork Weirdboy is an eye beam attack, with a strength comparable to the anti-armor melta weaponry used by the Imperium.
    -   The Gaze of Mork is a supercharged laser mounted in the eye of ork Gargants.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy_:
    -   Certain magic missiles manifest as this, such as the Gaze of Gork, the Gaze of Mork, the Gaze of Nagash and Shem's Burning Gaze, which are often projected from the user's eyes.
    -   The local version of a Gorgeous Gorgon has a deadly gaze attack that forces the victim's blood out from their skin.
-   _World of Synnibarr_ is notorious for having bears that attack with these. And it is not even in the top _thirty_ weirdest things about _World of Synnibarr_.

    Theme Parks 

-   The lava pit chamber in _Indiana Jones Adventure_ at the Disney Theme Parks features a giant stone skull that fires green rays out of one of its eyes.

    -   Heat Vision and Laser Vision are two of the forty-two Makuta powers. Other users include Rahkshi of Heat Vision and Tahu.
    -   Most Skakdi, including the Piraka, have some variant of this as well. Noticeably, not all of them had offensive-based versions. Three of the Piraka had telescopic/x-ray vision, infrared vision, and spellbinder (basically inducing confusion and vertigo) vision respectively alone.

    -   Church gets a powerful laser eye in _Recreation_ when he's transported into a spherical body.
        
        **Church:** I am not a thing! My name is Leonard Church AND YOU WILL FEAR MY LASERFACE!
        
-   _Thrilling Intent_ One of Markus' attacks involves shooting thin beams of fire from his eyes.
-   _X-Ray & Vav_ has this as X-Ray's main weapon, a pair of glasses that also give him X-Ray Vision. However, X-Ray is such a horrible shot, he'll end up destroying the city before he hits his target.

-   _Weesh_: Tate wishes he had laser eyes.

-   Superbitch has the ability to burn/melt and cure vision problems with her eyebeams.
-   _Grrl Power_ has a magical villain, Sciona, realize the flaw in this trope as she'd given herself a set with a blood cocktail.
    
    **Sciona:** _\[Thought-bubble\]_ This... this power is idiotic! It's so hard to see anything!

The blood is caustic, foul-tasting, and a bit of a surprise for a would-be predator.
