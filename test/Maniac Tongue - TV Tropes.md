He isn't nicknamed "Chameleon" for nothing.

A common gesture for villains, Anti Heroes or anyone with a mean, sadistic streak is to have a significant portion of their tongue extended out of their mouth even when there's no plausible reason to do so. Usually paired with an Evil Laugh, Laughing Mad or Slasher Smile. This is also a common gesture for dimwitted characters or oddball characters with goofy streaks of sticking their tongue out while there's no obvious reason to do so. Usually paired with being Comically Cross-Eyed, Fish Eyes, or having a Perpetual Smiler demeanor in one's appearance.

This, like Lecherous Licking, Finger-Lickin' Evil, Overly-Long Tongue and other tongue tropes, is using the squicky nature of the tongue to symbolize someone you just don't want to be around — in this case, a dangerous person. It can be used to show the character in question as mentally disturbed or impaired, or alternately just being silly. It's also heavily associated with The Rock Star, especially Heavy Metal stars. Also, a lot like being Comically Cross-Eyed and other stupidity tropes, is using the features of silliness to the tongue to symbolize someone who is just blissfully stupid or goofy.

For some reason this almost never deters said individual's ability to properly articulate.

This is also a very common trope used to convey a Villainous Crush, mixing unbridled sexual desire and twisted romantic feelings, _especially_ if the villain is also a Stalker with a Crush. In more comedic works, it's more a sign of Love Makes You Stupid, are often on the silly side of High-Pressure Emotion that makes one have a silly look on their face.

Subtrope of Character Tics. Compare Licking the Blade.
