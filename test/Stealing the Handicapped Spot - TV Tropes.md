For extra douche points, park diagonally!

_"Sometimes I park in handicapped spaces_  
_while handicapped people make handicapped faces._  
_I'm an asshole!"_

In popular media, one of the quickest and easiest ways to establish a character as a Jerkass is to have them (knowingly) park their car in a spot reserved for disabled people. If they're caught doing so and called out for it, the offender will refuse to apologize, either because they just enjoy inconveniencing others, or because they feel entitled to the space simply because they found it first.

Subtrope of Kick the Dog. Compare Parking Payback, when this kind of behavior is met with immediate retribution.

    Comic Books 

-   The Joker, of all people, _hates_ this, and finds it hilarious to horrifically cripple anyone guilty of stealing a handicapped spot so as to allow them to legitimately park in handicapped spots.
-   Similarly, Cletus "Carnage" Kasady at one point encounters a well-to-do businessman who illegally parks in the handicapped zone and rudely brushes off Cletus' objections. This turns out to be a transgression that even a murderous bastard like Carnage can't abide.
    
    **Carnage:** Hey mister, in case you didn't notice, that spot is reserved for the handicapped.
    
    **Businessman:** Mind your own business shorty, I'm in a hurry!
    
    **Carnage:** Shorty, moi? And here I was trying to save you from getting a ticket! Heyyy, I just got an even better idea! If you _really_ want that space, **I'LL CRIPPLE YOU _SO YOU'RE ENTITLED TO IT!_** I never could stomach a pompous fool like you! You think you're better than everyone else because you have a fancy car and a fat wallet!
    
-   In a _Deadpool_ story where he'd gone back in time to a Silver Age _Spider-Man_ story, Jerkass Flash Thompson does this, and is cruelly dismissive of "legless people" when Peter criticises him. This is an ironic Call-Forward to Flash's future as a Handicapped Badass.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   At the beginning of _Ali G Indahouse_, Ali steals a handicapped spot at the leisure center from an old man, faking a limp.

    Live Action TV 

-   _1000 Ways to Die_ has one segment that starts with a Jerk Jock surfer dude taking a handicapped spot away from a disabled veteran.

-   _Canada's Worst Driver_: In the "Canada's Worst Parking Lot" challenge, there's normally a handicapped parking space available, but any driver who tries parking there gets told off and has to find a different spot. Except, that is, for Season 14's Karlene, who _has_ a handicapped-parking permit. She just had to drive around the lot until someone brought it back from the hotel. In the same season, not only did someone else get told off for parking there, they actually _knocked over_ the sign indicating its being a handicapped parking space.

The gang hide out and wait until the crowd leaves, revealing they destroyed George's father's car.

In an alternate timeline, she herself, ironically, uses a wheelchair.
