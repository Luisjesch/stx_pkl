_"If you don't know what to do next, slowly pan the camera and shoot the sky..."_

— **Kyon**, _Haruhi Suzumiya_, "The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina: Episode 00"

A camera trick used at the end of an episode or movie, wherein the view pans up to the sky upon conclusion of a story arc. The characters usually look up along with the viewer, too, or are implied to.

The sky is a powerful symbol in itself. Here are just a few uses:

-   Clear blue sky (white clouds optional) promises happiness and freedom, just the things you expect from a Happy Ending.
-   Stormy, ominous sky, on the other hand, indicates that trouble is brewing.
-   A clearing storm signifies hope to come in the future, often bittersweetness.
-   Sunrise sky stands for renovation and a new beginning.
-   Sunset marks a conclusion and definite ending or death.
-   Night sky with visible stars has a similar meaning to clear daytime sky with an additional touch of eternity and divinity.
-   Shooting stars promise the fulfillment of wishes.
-   Birds and airplanes stand for unreachable things but also, freedom.

Compare Grasp the Sun, Flyaway Shot and Fly-at-the-Camera Ending. Contrast Ending by Ascending, when a character does this instead of the camera, and "Pan from the Sky" Beginning.

Has nothing to do with holding a frying pan in the air.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   _Stardust Crusaders_: After the group defeats Arabia Fats, the camera pans up to the night sky as they make way to their next destination.
    -   _Golden Wind_: In the epilogue before the final scene, a panning to the sky as the team heads to Rome's coliseum after Diavolo's defeat.
-   This is one of many tropes mocked by _Haruhi Suzumiya_ episode 00, with Kyon sarcastically commenting on the frequent panning up towards the sky.
-   _Cowboy Bebop_ does this for its finale, "The Real Folk Blues (Part 2)". Right before the pan up, protagonist Spike collapses from gunshot wounds. It's ambiguously either a Bittersweet Ending or a straight up Downer Ending.
-   Both _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's_ and _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ use the clear blue sky version, with the added touch of the show's title appearing in the sky like it does in the intro.
    -   Likewise, _StrikerS Sound Stage X_ ends with Subaru looking up to the sky, reminiscing about Ixpellia. Particulary impressive, since this is a Drama CD.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ does this to cap off the Distant Finale, showing Gurren Lagann spiralling of into the night, piercing the heavens still.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood_ ends this way while Ed speaks his final monologue. It's then followed by a "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue Photo Montage for ending credits.

-   Invoked in _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ right after the final duel concludes and the characters are left in the desert, with the camera rising to the sky. However, this isn't the actual final scene, but the 4Kids Entertainment dub pulls another whammy and cuts out the last moments of the last episode. Gee, thanks.
-   _Bleach_ uses the clear blue sky version at the end of the Arrancar arc.
-   The anime of _Death Note_ ends with panning up to a night sky and crescent moon.
-   _The Girl Who Leapt Through Time_ ends this way, though there is another quick scene on the baseball pitch after that.
-   In the ending of _Your Name_, the scene pans up to a blue sky with bright clouds right after Taki and Mitsuha finally find each other again, break into Tears of Joy and asking each other's name 5 years (8 for Mitsuha) after the comet flew by and both of them forgot about each other.
-   _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_ does the blue sky version as Kobyashi takes Tohru and Kanna to meet her parents.
-   The first opening for _Saiyuki_, _For Real_, ends with a pan up to the sky, with the lower half of the shot showing their destination, Gyumaou's castle in the West.
-   Most _Pokémon: The Series_ episodes end this way.

    Film - Animation 

-   _Coco_: The very last shot of the movie pans up from Miguel to a shot of the banner from the beginning framed against fireworks lighting up the sky.
-   _Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch_ ends this way with a starry night sky, while a star twinkles to prove Lilo's mother would be proud of her.
-   _The Princess and the Frog_, like _Spirit_, begins with an inversion, staring on a shot of the Evening Star, then panning down to the streets of New Orleans; the end plays it straight, panning up from Tiana and Naveen dancing to the Evening Star and Ray the firefly, now a star himself in the night sky.
-   _Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron_ _begins_ by inverting this, showing a beautiful blue sky filled with horse-shaped clouds before panning down across the landscape and coming to Spirit's racing herd. At the end of the film, the trope is then played straight, as after Spirit returns home to lead the herd, the camera pans back up to the same sky.
-   _Toy Story 3_ ends with a pan up to the blue sky, calling back to the first movie's opening with a shot of the sky, with clouds that look like those on the wallpaper in Andy's room.
-   In _Turning Red_, when Mei and Ming close up the temple for the day there is a pan up from them to the sky.

    Film - Live Action 

-   After everyone goes in for a group hug near the end of _Bad Times at the Battle Royale_, the camera pans up to the clouds before the credits roll.
-   _Ballad of a Soldier_, which establishes in the opening scene that the young soldier protagonist will be killed in combat at some point after the movie's time frame, pans up to the sky at the end as the voiceover muses that he could have done many things with his life if he'd lived, but in the end will be remembered as a Russian soldier.
-   The final scene of _Battle of Britain_ shows the sky over England, which has a few clouds in it, but after months of struggle against the Luftwaffe, finally has no German planes.
-   _City of Ember_ ends with the sun rising into a bright blue sky, which is especially meaningful because the characters have spent their entire lives living in an underground city, never knowing there was anything different or that there was such a thing as the sun or sky.
-   _Easy A_ begins and ends this way, with the Screen Gems logo.
-   Most of the _Harry Potter_ films end this way.
-   _The Nativity Story_ ends with the sun and clouds on a bright day.
-   The final shot of _Ophelia_ pans up from Ophelia and her daughter walking across a hill to a flock of birds soaring across the sky, symbolizing that Ophelia has found freedom and happiness.
-   At the end of _The Professional_ the camera zooms up from Mathilda onto the skyline of New York.
-   In _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World_, the camera pans up from the closed door to the sky, giving us a "Continue?" and countdown, evoking arcade games. At zero, the credits begin.

    Literature 

-   In the end of Arthur C. Clarke's _The Nine Billion Names of God_, the protagonists look up at the sky and see the stars going out one by one.
-   Sergey Lukyanenko's _Seekers of the Sky_ duology ends with the protagonist Ilmar looking up while atop Tel Megiddo, having just refused to follow Marcus as one of his apostles, claiming that Marcus is not second coming of The Messiah and believing that, as before, there must be one dissenter.
-   _Togetherly Long_: In order to convey this effect in a written work, the story mentions various creatures at different elevations that might hear the lines of dialogue of two characters that are talking to each other as the scene ends, and it mentions how the conversation would sound fainter and fainter to successively higher creatures.

    Live Action TV 

-   This shot was used at the end of every episode of _The Twilight Zone (1959)_.
-   This is used in the final episode of _The Fades_, which functions as a Sequel Hook by showing that the sky has turned blood-red.
-   This was used going into a commercial in the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "The City On The Edge Of Forever." Inexplicably, the stars in the sky change to a different pattern 2 seconds before the commercial break.
-   A starry night sky is used at end of the first season of _True Detective_ to illustrate Rust's belief that although the dark may be greater, the light is winning.
-   A lot of reality TV shows make use of this for at least some episodes. It works because the "universe" of reality television is not bound within a contained space like a studio set or a piece of paper.

-   Both _Kirby Super Star_ and _Kirby's Return to Dream Land_ end with a long pan across the blue sky (and eventually into space).

-   The Cut Scene animation created for the PS version of _Chrono Trigger_ does this twice in the perfect ending—once after Chrono and Marle's wedding when she throws the bouquet, and again after Lucca finds baby Kid (Schala's clone from _Chrono Cross_).
    -   _Chrono Cross_ itself also has this in its perfect ending—after you free Schala from the Time Devourer and the two worlds are reunited and restored, but before the end credits roll, Serge ends up back on Opassa Beach with Leena right when he passed out at the start of the game, and as he's asking about things he wasn't supposed to remember from his adventures, you get the pan.

-   _Dawn of War_: Dark Crusade's Eldar stronghold ends with the Avatar dead and Taldeer telling her surviving troops to flee. Then, as it was her vision who led them to their deaths, she runs down the ramp into the player's army as the camera pans slowly upwards... Occasionally turns into Narm when a strong blow sends her cartwheeling back up the ramp when the camera hasn't gone all the way up yet.
-   _Eternal Sonata_ combines this with the Kissing Discretion Shot by panning up to the blue sky with puffy white clouds as Allegretto and Polka embrace and then share their first kiss.
