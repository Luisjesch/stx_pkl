_I'm only Describing The '90s Here ironically._

The Nimble Nineties: The Cold War had come to an end and people were starting to fear Y2K. All of the kids (of whom the older ones were of the cynical and disaffected Generation X) listened to grunge bands, wore flannel or a Jennifer Aniston haircut while watching _Friends_, _Seinfeld_ and _The X-Files_. Or they listened to Gangsta Rap, wore their baseball caps sideways paired with ridiculously baggy cargo pants and routinely "capped" people who "dissed" them, or they were beaten up by police and taped. _Or_ they were the early ravers dressing in even baggier JNCO jeans, kandi beads, and pacifiers (to help out with teeth gnashing from ecstasy) and listened to electronica. Everything was neon, colorful, and Totally Radical. Cowabunga!

The world at this time was awash in radical changes and catastrophes on a global scale. The Soviet Union collapsed<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Nelson Mandela was finally freed from prison, Iraq invaded Kuwait, and Margaret Thatcher hung up her handbag.

Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Rwanda exploded into savage sectarian genocide, while Liberia and Sierra Leone faced deadly civil wars that were frustratingly difficult for other nations to stop, provided that they even cared. Radicals revolted against corporations in Seattle at the beginning and end of the decade. Germany reunited after decades of post-World War II division, Czechoslovakia split up and Canada came within a hair's breadth of doing the same<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Japan came to terms with the end of its economic bubble and settled in for the long, frustrating stagnation of "The Lost Decade". "Made in Japan" was replaced by Red China as the big outsourcing villain. HIV awareness grew, with disgust towards its victims gradually being replaced with sympathy upon Freddie Mercury's death from pneumonia exacerbated by AIDS in 1991. Additionally, the notorious spread of the virus among the heterosexual population of Africa finally killed off the "Gay Plague" stereotype of HIV, even as effective drug regimes were at long last developed. Meanwhile, Anita Hill would expose the social blight of sexual harassment that too many women endure in the workplace and elsewhere in the US Congress and thus the popular world at large. There were riots in Los Angeles and the OJ Simpson chase/trial/media circus. The younger tropers might have been born at this time — possibly in the back of a white SUV.

In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan pressured Mullah Omar's Afghanistan to extradite a dissolute Saudi nobleman, Osama bin Laden, who was holed up in the newly radicalized Afghanistan. It was almost as if he was planning something big... At this time, Bin Laden was not yet a household name, so when Bill Clinton dropped a bomb on an alleged Bin Laden hideout, many questioned the President's motives. Some critics suggested he was merely trying to distract the public from his many scandals, à la _Wag the Dog_. Of course, this suggestion may appear Harsher in Hindsight.

The conservative-dominated Reagan/Bush/Thatcher/Gorbachev era ended with a bang as "greed is good" got replaced by the 1987 Wall Street Crash and postwar recession ennui through the early '90s; the violent polarization of the '70s finally culminated in a return to centrism among the general populace as moderate liberals swiftly replaced the hard left and hard right of the preceding decades. In the U.S., Ross Perot led a political revolution of pissed-off independent voters; dissatisfaction with "The Man" became the norm, and Rush Limbaugh-inspired Conspiracy Theorist talk radio became the rage. Bill Clinton got elected thanks to Gulf War Syndrome, and remained popular during and after his presidency, even and especially during his impeachment trial in 1998. The right would eventually return to prominence during the latter half of the decade though, with born-again-Christian conservatives eventually sweeping away the secular, Clinton-led left in 2000. The opioid crisis started in the U.S., mainstreaming negative attitudes towards Predatory Big Pharma (both for accurate reasons and conspiracy theories). Meanwhile, Seattle coffee culture was all the rage as a Starbucks opened up on every street corner, driving fear into the hearts of Hipsters everywhere, who sought solace in Post-Hardcore, Postmodernism, and other things with "post-" and "-core" in it. In the U.K., Tony Blair and his 'New Labour' swept to power on a landslide, hailing a new era of optimism and 'Cool Britannia', fueled by an explosion of bands like The Spice Girls, Blur, and Oasis, and the transformation of Premier League football into an international spectacle, sport mingling with celebrity culture — most notably with the marriage of David and Victoria "Posh Spice" Beckham.

Modern culture's obsession with electronics was born in The '80s and became dominant in the Turn of the Millennium, but it really came of age in the last half of this decade as people switched out computer models every other year. Dolly the sheep was cloned. GPS became operational. Cell phones became smaller and more common. Home computers that were actually easy to use instead of requiring a degree in programming became cheap enough to be affordable to everyone, and this, coupled with the invention of the World Wide Web <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , inevitably led to the explosion of the Internet <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , which opened the floodgates. Porn, gifs of kittens, porn, jokes about the Clinton sex scandal and evil overlords, and porn involving Clinton were widely accessible for the first time. Bulletin Boards hooked up, moving from dial-in systems to the web. People began to band together to discuss their opinions of _Star Trek_ and _Star Wars_ on Usenet, the original "message board" system. Soon, other people joined in to talk about other shows, too, and thus the seeds for the birth of this wiki were planted. So while in 1990 teenagers who "spent time on computer message boards" were nerds, by 1999 it was a social stigma among teenagers if you didn't have an e-mail address.

On the business side of the internet sensation came the Dot-Com Bubble of the late-'90s, powering the biggest economic boom of the 20th century and putting even the best years of The Roaring '20s, The '50s, and The '80s to shame, meaning people had more money than ever to spend on all the exciting new technology while at the same time ironically having less cash in their pockets than ever thanks to another exciting new technology: digital banking. ATMs appeared on every street corner and allowed people to withdraw as much money from their accounts as they needed anywhere at anytime 24/7 without having to deal with asshole bank employees. In store debit often eliminated the need for cash at all, and the credit card was never more widely used (partly because more places than ever were accepting them, and partly because people didn't quite grasp the long term consequences of their overuse and abuse yet). Some even predicted the end of paper money all together. As the Web Browser was invented, garage entrepreneurs sold content-free websites for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Nineties also saw the largest government budget surplus in American history.

The Ford Explorer became the first SUV<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and the GM EV-1 became the first (production, consumer) modern electric car. The Explorer would be successful, while the EV-1 would not for the same reason as the Sega Game Gear of the same decade, as indeed was a problem for many of the decade's portable devices, the incredible new technology drained batteries too fast, as GM insisted it be fitted with the same lead-acid batteries as all its cars. The Lithium batteries that would power the cars and electronics of future decades were still in their infancy, and still far too expensive and unproven for most manufacturers or consumers to bother with. The gas crisis of the next decade had its origins in the shortsightedness of a decade when gasoline was much cheaper. Cars from this decade are easy to spot thanks to a cartoonishly curvy look, moving beyond the unaerodynamic box-on-wheels design that dominated The '70s and The '80s, thanks to computer-aided drafting and design, but still not quite like the more aerodynamic angular cut corners look that dominated in the Turn of the Millennium and The New '10s.

Electronics underwent a similar change in design from depressingly boxy to cartoonishly curvy, culminating in the first iMac, and from analog to digital for exactly the same reason. In terms of media technology, this was the decade of Cable TV and the first emerging direct-broadcast satellite TV services.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Movies ran on VHS or in Multiplex theaters with digital sound systems. DVD emerged at the end of the decade, but was in its infancy and ridiculously expensive. Music came on CDs or cassette tapes in the very early '90s, to a more CD dominated culture until the invention of Napster.

Internet dollars gentrified the inner city, turning what had been viewed as an irredeemable wasteland into a playpen for the rich. Every building, sneaker, and coffee shop was painted in pastel colors with the black lights at the rave club making them all glow, along with that mustard stain you thought you got out weeks ago.

Everyone attended music festivals like Lollapalooza or Lilith Fair — or at least, claimed to their friends that they did, as they were just as likely doing either "Lambada" or "The Macarena". In the US Grunge dominated the real life soundtrack for five years, before collapsing into an identity crisis. Kurt Cobain continued chart-topping for two years after his death, alongside Alanis Morissette and Alice in Chains, eventually replaced by pop music, which had managed to reinvent itself following the Milli Vanilli lip-syncing scandal (which itself played a partial role in Grunge's rise), during the latter half of the decade. Across the pond, meanwhile, Britpop and the Cool Britannia movement soared; Oasis and Blur had their famous chart war, while the Spice Girls became cultural icons. In academia, modernism was out and relativism was in; the magazine _Social Text_ published a word salad hoax by an angry physicist as the "Culture Wars" smoldered between scientists, anti-abortionists, and radical academicians. Alternative Rock took over rock music, along with the Perishing Alt-Rock Voice. Boy bands and girl groups began to dominate the market, and two major Gangsta Rap stars were killed within months of each other following a war of egos between the east and west coasts. Electronic Music continued to refine itself over this decade, spawning numerous different genres (and sub-genres) and growing massive fan scenes across the globe (except in the USA which took longer to catch on), with all-night dance parties, AKA "raves", becoming the new target of moral panic among politicians and moral guardians (not helped by the deep associations with drug use).

CGI completely changed what you could see on the silver screen. Blockbusters like _Jurassic Park_ and _Titanic (1997)_ made full use of cutting-edge visual effects on their way to record-smashing box-offices. The first animated films created entirely in CGI also began their slow but steady takeover of the animated marketplace. On the other side of the spectrum, indie films became hot commodities as young, self-made filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith and Richard Linklater used the advances in filmmaking technology to create unique, edgy films on shoestring budgets. For a whole year, America lost its collective mind in the woods of Maryland over a film made on handheld cameras. _Seinfeld_, after a shaky start in 1989, shot to wild popularity. _The Simpsons_ redefined both animation and the family Sitcom. Reality Television started. The millennial decade's comedy superstars were getting themselves known on _Saturday Night Live_, including future (now-retired) senator Al Franken. _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ got really good, then was canceled twice. After people got the answer as to who killed Laura Palmer, Special Agents Mulder and Scully chased aliens, monsters, and other creepy creatures, Buffy Summers chased vampires, demons, and vampire boyfriends, while Hercules and Xena fought the tyranny of the gods in ancient Greece. Surfing and going to the beach became even more popular thanks to _Baywatch_, which became the most popular syndicated television show on the planet and turned Pamela Anderson into probably the most famous sex symbol since Marilyn Monroe. This was also the heyday of modern-era _Star Trek_, with _TNG_, _DS9_ and _Voyager_ all airing in the same decade. Furthermore, that franchise finally got real competition from _Babylon 5_ and _Stargate SG-1_. The UK, meanwhile, would be at a bit of a loss, what with their most famous science-fiction series getting canned in 1989 and not returning for 16 years, save for an American-produced telemovie in 1996. This did, however, give enough time for _Doctor Who_ to reclaim a sizeable enough following on both sides of the pond (partly thanks to its syndication on PBS) as people began to reflect on the factors that led to the show's downfall in the late '80s, eventually culminating in the show's return in 2005.

Adventure Games hit it big in the mid-1990s; Strategy Sim games with orthographic landscapes were invented. People bought games in boxes with elaborate supplements and funky midi music. Or pirated off their neighborhood BBS, along with the copy protect page. "The 3D revolution" meant vector graphics, which meant "virtual reality" and _Wolfenstein_. Superman came back (albeit with a horrible game). _Doom_, _Mortal Kombat_, and _Pokémon_ scared the Moral Guardians.

Games like _Super Mario RPG_, _Chrono Trigger_, and the _Dragon Warrior_ and _Final Fantasy_ series introduced Western gamers to the concept of the Japanese Role-Playing Game, and with the arrival of _Final Fantasy VII_ and _Pokémon_ in the latter part of the decade, the genre went mainstream: _Pokémon_ became a worldwide phenomenon of unprecedented scale, while SquareSoft became a household name for any video game enthusiast, and their games came to exemplify the cutting edge of innovation in graphics, sound and storytelling in games for years to come.

Kids and adolescents played _Street Fighter_ in the arcade leading to a Fighting Game boom led by Capcom, SNK, Sega and Namco. On the PC side of things, _Doom_ helped make the First-Person Shooter mainstream and _StarCraft_ was starting to conquer Korea.

However, when it comes to gaming in the 1990s, nothing defines it better than one phrase: "Genesis does what Nintendon't". Created for the Sega Genesis's initial North American ad campaign in 1989, this would mark the first spark in the inferno that was the fourth-generation Console Wars, with Sega's new 16-bit system butting heads with the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, an attempt by Nintendo to stay relevant after having their late-'80s domination crushed by competition from evolving technology. With Sega's _Sonic the Hedgehog_ and crass ad campaign preaching to teens that Nintendo was nothing more than a washed-up kiddie company, Nintendo would fight back with full-force, as both companies repeatedly attempted to outdo each other with various advertisements, technological marvels, and blockbuster titles as their fanbases picked fights on the playground over whether they were loyal to the slick black Sonic system or the boxy gray Mario machine. Despite a decade of brisk competition from Sega, Nintendo would end up winning this battle, with the SNES outselling the Genesis by 50%, or roughly 15 million units. However, both Nintendo and Sega would end up being blindsided by the sudden success of the Play Station, Sony's fifth-gen revenge against both companies for backstabbing the consumer electronics company (itself another lengthy story detailed on the PlayStation's own page). Sega would find themselves in a mountain of debt with the failures of the 32X (a 32-bit stopgap add-on for the Genesis) and the Sega Saturn (the result of internal feuding and mismanagement); they'd release one last console at the very end of the decade before the inability to recoup their losses forced them out of the hardware business in 2001. As for Nintendo, while they remained persistent with the Nintendo 64 and the Nintendo Game Cube, not until 2006 would they be the kings of the hill again, partly due to their adherence to cartridges when CDs had already become the dominant physical medium in the industry. Overall, the '90s marked both the golden and dark ages for the two biggest names in the console market.

Virtual pets, Pogs, yo-yos, laser pointers and Beanie Babies were all the rage with kids. The Razor scooter and roller blades were invented and quickly considered two of the must have items, and the Discman began to replace the Walkman. In Japan, we saw a farewell to the Darker and Edgier _Metal Heroes_ and _Kamen Rider_ as well as _Ultra Series_ as they went through an ice age while _Super Sentai_ prospered and was beginning to be adapted for western audiences as _Power Rangers_.

Michael Jordan reigned, retired, and returned. Mark McGwire and other beefy dudes beat out Roger Maris as home-run king, totally legitimately. The New York Yankees "dream team" inspired Americans with good old-fashioned teamwork from 1997-2001. David Beckham became a star. The NHL introduced a ridiculous new rule which they would abolish after it brought extreme controversy in the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals. Fox Sports, after a sudden establishment following their snatching of the NFL rights from CBS (resulting in a Disaster Dominoes situation when they upgraded their affiliate base), introduced a glowing puck for American audiences. This also crashed and burned. The game's greatest player, Wayne Gretzky, retired at the close of the decade. _American Gladiators_, having debuted at the tail-end of the 80s, came out of nowhere and became a cultural icon with their superhero-esque Gladiators and determined contenders, as well as the frankly-bizarre events (dueling with giant Q-tips, rushing around inside giant metal hamster balls, etc.), with a British version becoming even more successful.

The Dark Age of Comic Books was going strong, and Rob Liefeld was at his peak of popularity as comics became gradually Darker and Edgier, before hitting the brick wall of the comics crash, while the likes of _Kingdom Come_ killed the "Grim and Gritty" mid-decade.

_AKIRA_, originally released in Japan in 1988, became a surprise cult hit on home video in the West, ushering in an entire generation of anime fandom and helping, along with _The Simpsons_, to mount a serious offensive against the Animation Age Ghetto. Following in its footsteps, _Ghost in the Shell (1995)_, _Princess Mononoke_, and _Perfect Blue_ would go on to grab the attention of serious film critics the world over and signal the arrival of adult-oriented animation as an artistic presence. Meanwhile, _Pokémon_ redefined "Cash-Cow Franchise" for millions of children (and adults) around the world. _Sailor Moon_ gave girls strong female heroes to idolize besides Wonder Woman;<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  on the flipside, _Dragon Ball Z_ redefined "action cartoon", and would be responsible for more kids taking martial arts than anything since _The Karate Kid_;<sup>*&nbsp;</sup>  _Ranma ½_ became the most famous and funniest show to never be able to be shown on US Television.<sup>*&nbsp;</sup>  _Slayers_ and _Record of Lodoss War_ showed the D&D community that Japan was just as nerdy as we are. The Toonami Cartoon Network block was launched, bringing Anime to the viewing options of The Nineties children en masse. Even though it took almost a decade for it to be widely accepted as "mainstream" media in the United States (it was already mainstream in Latin America before that), and its influence should be obvious by now.

Back in Japan, the surprise breakthrough of _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ shook the anime world with its dark Deconstruction of the medium; its unexpected success proved not only a Genre Turning Point but an outright _Medium_ Turning Point, changing the landscape of televised anime forever. TV anime had up until _Evangelion_ been a very mainstream affair, consisting pretty much exclusively of family-oriented shows and adaptations of popular manga, with only the more niche Original Video Animation market trying to push the medium's artistic limits. In _Evangelion_'s wake a torrent of imitators sprung up, attempting (with varying degrees of success) to copy its visceral mecha combat, trippy plot, and unconventional use of Judeo-Christian symbolism. But more importantly, _Evangelion_ also proved that more mature Anime First properties could be profitable on the TV circuit, leading to more original, experimental, and darker shows starting to appear throughout the last half of the decade, the most successful examples of which were _The Vision of Escaflowne_, _Cowboy Bebop_, _Revolutionary Girl Utena_, _Serial Experiments Lain_, _The Big O_, and _Now and Then, Here and There_. Still, the new era of more experiential TV-anime started by _Evangelion_ would first truly kick into high gear in the early years of the next decade, and the show's influence would continue to be felt as a constant background hum throughout it. Some argue that _Evangelion_'s shadow even still looms over the anime industry in The New '10s.

The US saw what amounted to a cartoon revolution in this decade. The 80s has seen a somewhat increase in quality from the 60s and 70s, especially on TV, but there were still a lot of issues like Animation Age Ghetto and Limited Animation at play (not to mention that most tv cartoons were Merchandise-Driven, thanks to 80s deregulation). Towards the end of the decade, movies like _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ in 1988 and _The Little Mermaid_ in 1989 showed the world an unprecedented return to form, and reminded them that cartoons could be a serious art form. Disney also started releasing TV shows based on their classic characters, like _DuckTales (1987)_ and _Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers_, which contained a level of quality never seen on TV before. With this in mind, the 90s saw both Disney and Warner Bros. get back to their roots. Disney started producing lavishly animated films again, like _Beauty and the Beast_, _Aladdin_, and _The Lion King_. Their success was more mixed in the latter half of the decade, but still, there’s a reason people tend to call this the Disney Renaissance. Meanwhile, Warner Bros. decided to mostly stick to TV, meaning they made some of the most influential tv shows in history during this time. Under Steven Spielberg himself, _Looney Tunes_ saw a big revival, and their zany style of humor carried over to the insanely popular _Animaniacs_. On the other end of the spectrum, Bruce Timm and Paul Dini started work on grim and gritty _Batman: The Animated Series_. Not only did it defy the age ghetto through its amazing writing and dark tone, but it was so popular that it started a whole animated universe of spin-off shows! Finally, as mentioned previously, Pixar came in to its own in the 90s after previously sticking to commercials and special effects. The success of _Toy Story_, as well as the hit shows _Reboot_ and _Beast Wars_ by Mainframe Entertainment, proved that CGI was the future of animation. The departure of Jeffery Katzenberg from Disney after _The Lion King_ to found DreamWorks Animation only further solidified this idea, not to mention started a rivalry that lasts to this very day.

The Nineties politically started with the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989 and the Soviet Union dissolving on December 26, 1991, and ended with both the 2000 Presidential election which saw the victory of George W. Bush and the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 which left people so stupefied that it functioned as something of a cultural reset button. Pop-culturally, it started with the release of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" on September 10, 1991, and in 1992 with both the rise of Grunge and the emergence of the heroin chic fad and ended with the increased rise of online sharing and when the September 11 terrorist attacks happened making this one of the longest cultural decades. To distinguish the era from the "Turn Of The Millennium", look for the twin towers of the original World Trade Center in establishing shots or title sequences of TV shows and films set in New York City. Of course, this is also true for the 1970s, 1980s, and the very early 2000s. One could argue though that the cultural 1990s instead ended with the rise of Boy Bands in 1997, the premiere of _Total Request Live_ on MTV in 1998, the quashed Seattle rebellion of November 30, 1999, the bursting of the Dot-Com Bubble on March 11, 2000 and subsequent 2001-2002 recession (which marked a jobless turning point for the new generation) or in 2002 when MTV stopped playing music videos.

Because most media is Two Decades Behind, Fictionland ended up being set in this decade in The New '10s, and at the start of The New '20s this decade still looms large in pop culture.

The word "Nineties" means a very different thing in post-Soviet Russia, a thing much more cynical on the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism.

Not to be confused with The Gay '90s, which were a century earlier. But these Nineties were probably just as gay.

## Tropes associated with the 1990s:

Naturally, a lot of technology tropes due to the rapid pace of technology and the Internet:

    Tropes 

-   The '70s: Nothing says the '90s more than nostalgia for the '70s.
    -   Bellbottoms came back in style for a brief moment. _Dazed and Confused_, _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_, _That '70s Show_, _The Brady Bunch_ movies, _Scooby-Doo_ jokes, etc. The '90s itself, alongside with the '80s, subsequently became the nostalgic decade of The New '10s.
    -   N-Trance basically built their career around sampling old Disco songs (now that America had gotten over the intense hatred of the genre that existed in The '80s) and remixing them with Hip-Hop and Electronic Dance.
    -   A lot of Grunge acts were inspired by '70s hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.
    -   Earth tones became popular again in interior design and fashion.
-   '70s Hair: Long male hair made a comeback in the '90s thanks to Grunge.
-   '90s Anti-Hero: This era and many of its comics are the Trope Namer.
-   '90s Hair: Exemplified by long hair that fits the Grunge look, or bald shaven heads to go clubbing, or with curtains. In the case of African-Americans, hi-top fades and box braids were the style.
-   Action Girl: Arrived with a bang in this decade. _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_ saw Sarah Connor undergoing Xenafication to become a huge paragon of feminism in the public eye. On television we got _Xena: Warrior Princess_, _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ and _Charmed_, as well as the _Power Rangers_ increasing the female presence by adapting the male Yellow Ranger to a female to make it Two Girls to a Team, while the _Sailor Moon_ anime became one of the Toonami block's flagship shows. Starting with Ariel in _The Little Mermaid_, Disney heroines became more proactive and the majority of them were now Action Girls too. It didn't necessarily translate well to film — as _The Long Kiss Goodnight_ was a flop, as were _Tank Girl_ and _Barb Wire_, but _Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later_ turned the franchise's Final Girl Laurie Strode into one. The love interest in action movies usually would get in on the action too, even if only in a Designated Girl Fight or Action Survivor sort of way.
-   All Animation Is Disney: Re-established by the "Disney Renaissance" lasting from 1989 to 1999, which returned the company to prominence over the animation industry.
-   All-CGI Cartoon: The earliest ones that are still remembered today were made during this decade, with _Toy Story_ as the pioneer for future CGI feature films.
-   Animated Shock Comedy: Almost every animated series aimed for adults, even the _The Simpsons_, commonly used shock value to gear themselves towards older audiences. This genre is popularized by _South Park_, which debuted in 1997.
-   Anime and Manga of the 1990s: Even with Japan experiencing an economic bubble burst during this decade, and a moral backlash against anime with ultraviolent and hypersexual content after the "Otaku Killer" incident, the Japanese animation industry still upped the ante with lunar-powered or card-wielding Magical Girls, mind screwing child-powered alien-fighting mecha, multinational peacekeeping mecha pilots, hair-raising-powered cosmic guardians, genderbending martial artists, spacefaring bounty hunters, high school basketball, high school spirit detectives, a high school sleuth in a kid's body, a teenage seer sucked into a war torn planet, two girls trapped in an old Chinese book, a fire-wielding ninja, a giant sword-wielding demon slayer, and a kid destined to be a master by catching monsters.
-   Award-Bait Song: Disney just loved this about this time. And who could ever forget "My Heart Will Go On"?
-   Axes at School: This was the first time school shootings received national media coverage and was seen as an actual issue. While there had been school shootings in the United States every year since The '60s, it wasn't until the tragedies at Paducah, Springfield, and especially Columbine, that it was considered a real issue by the public.
-   Badass Longcoat: Became really popular towards the end of the decade and leading into the first few years of the 2000s.
-   Bare Midriffs Are Feminine: It was in this decade that crop tops became less a specific, intentionally sexy look, and more shorthand for 'teenage girl'.
-   The Bard on Board: The decade was noticeable with adaptations of Shakespeare's works, such as artistic takes of _Hamlet_ by Kenneth Branagh and William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet by Baz Luhrmann, both in 1996; derivations like _The Lion King_ (based on _Hamlet_), and _10 Things I Hate About You_ (based on _The Taming of the Shrew_); and even historical fiction him like _Shakespeare in Love_. No coincidence that much of his plays passed the 400-year milestones.
-   Blaxploitation Parody: It became acceptable in the Nineties to make fun of (and occasionally homage) the Blaxploitation films of the Seventies.
-   Boyish Short Hair: Pixie cuts were quite popular, and some daring women in the rave scene would shave their heads completely.
-   Breather Episode: This decade is often portrayed as such in American works. With the Cold War finally ending in 1991, the United States was left to enjoy the longest-lasting period of economic expansion in its history (at the time), while suffering few-to-no disasters or military conflicts. As such, the '90s are nostalgically remembered in America as being a peaceful, affluent and overall _nicer_ period of history, especially compared to what came before or after.
-   Chupacabra: Although reports of farm animals drained of blood began in the 1970s, the term "Chupacabra" and the description of the creature as we know it originated in 1995, probably inspired by _Species_.
-   Collectible Card Game: Started with Magic: The Gathering in 1993, and now _everything_ has a CCG (no matter how short-lived).
-   Covered in Gunge: Showed up in kids' shows and cartoons a lot in this era. Nickelodeon was famous for its green slime in these days.
-   Crapsaccharine World: A favorite theme of pop culture of the decade (particularly science-fiction). Many of the decade's most popular films — like _Fight Club_, _Eyes Wide Shut_, _Mulholland Dr._, _The Game (1997)_, _A Beautiful Mind_, _The Truman Show_, _Office Space_, _American Beauty_, _Dark City_ and _The Matrix_ — dealt with the artificiality and mundanity of middle-class life, and the implicit horror of seemingly perfect worlds. Notably, this came crashing down in a big way at the beginning of the following decade. After the one-two punch of the 9/11 attacks and the 2007 recession, artificiality and mundanity suddenly seemed like a nice alternative to terror and poverty.
-   Cyber Punk Is Techno: Every cyberpunk film got a techno soundtrack during this era. Electronic Music and rave culture entered the popular lexicon throughout Europe, North America, and other scattered loactions throughout the world.
-   Cyclic National Fascination:
    -   With the growing popularity of the Grunge scene, a brewing coffee culture, and a rising tech and video game industry, Seattle becomes the forefront of pop culture starting throughout the decade.
    -   Oireland, in response to the cool down after the The Troubles, and owing to the economic boom, and a blossoming Celtic revival, became a center of cultural attention starting in the second half of the decade. Music acts of a myriad of genres were everywhere such as Sinéad O'Connor, The Cranberries, B\*Witched, The Corrs, Westlife, and Boyzone.
    -   Chinoiserie becomes a hot topic in two waves. The first wave came in 1993 following the premiere of _The Joy Luck Club_ and the death of Brendan Lee that also triggered the nostalgia of kung-fu films, and also brought forth Hong Kong stars like director John Woo and actor Jackie Chan to Hollywood. The second wave came with Hong Kong's handover in 1997 and the premiere of Disney's _Mulan_ in 1998 with odangos, mini-qipaos, yin-and-yang, tiger and dragon motifs, and sometimes embarrassingly inaccurate tattoos of Chinese characters, becoming fashionable.
    -   The 90s was also the decade of the anime boom, slowly gaining a growing fandom through sales of VHS tapes, then exploding into mainstream popularity in 1996 with _Sailor Moon_, _Dragon Ball Z_, and _Pokémon_, followed by Toonami bringing other shows to promenence. By the end of the decade over 80% of young people between the ages of 14 and 35 watched at least one hour of anime a week.
-   Dance Sensation:
    -   Vogueing, coming from the black and Latin LGBT community in Harlem, became mainstream after the release of Madonna's "Vogue" in 1990.
    -   The release of Billy Ray Cyrus' "Achy Breaky Heart" put western style line dancing into dance floors everywhere.
    -   The Macarena. _Everyone_ danced to it, _everywhere_, and no other dance craze has arguably come close to it since.
-   Darker and Edgier: The early part of the decade could be best described for many like a bad hangover, with many disillusioned former yuppies finding emotional emptiness and the rest suffering from the ailing economy, and a new generation coming into adulthood with an appropriately pessimistic outlook. Pop culture also reflected this, with _The Simpsons_, for one, reflecting upon familial dysfunction, and the frivolous Hair Metal subgenre was driven out by the rise of darker sounding Alternative Rock in the mainstream.
-   Delinquent Hair: The trend of young men's hairstyles combining spikes and dye. "Frosted tips", or spiked hair with the ends bleached-blond, became as much of a style icon of the late '90s as big hair was in the '80s.
-   Denser and Wackier: Art and animation styles and techniques became more surreal and deconstructive in this era. Animated shows produced by Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon like _Cow and Chicken_ and _Ren & Stimpy_ respectively, with its exaggerated reactions, distorted art styles, Large Ham voice acting, and Gainax Endings, became popular in this era. Klasky-Csupo introduced many Eastern European Animation styles to the West, exemplified by grotesque, crude and surreal cartoons such as _Duckman_ and _Aaahh!!! Real Monsters_.
-   Edutainment Show: If kids shows in this decade were not about slime and grossouts, then they were these. In contrast to the celebrity-based animated shows and 30 minute commercial cartoons of the previous decade, and taking advantage of the certain laws such as the American Children's Television Act of 1990, which limited advertisements on kids shows, this decade focused on shows about teaching kids and teens on topics ranging from science to literature to morals to the environment to dinosaurs while also not losing the zaniness.
-   Extreme Sports Plot: Ever since extreme sports like skateboarding, motorcross, surfing, snowboarding, and rock climbing became popular in the decade, shows that never done this before or don't necessarily need this got on with it due to its themes of new hobbies, passion, physical activity, sportsmanship, and teamwork.
-   Everything Is Online: "If it exists you'll find it on the Internet" became a popular slogan.
-   Five-Token Band: In this decade, more and more kids from different nationalities would group together in different shows or advertisements.
-   Hide Your Gays: Was becoming more of a discredited trope in this decade as more LGBT people started coming out, some of the most famous including Ellen Degeneres (who did it in an episode of her self-titled sitcom) and singer Melissa Etheridge, leading to a slow but certain wider acceptance of LGBT people. It wasn't all positive though — the majority of society still disapproved of gays marrying, "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" was established, and homophobic bullying reached brutal heights, culminating in the murder of Matthew Shepard (though on the positive side, his killers were sentenced to life behind bars).
-   Hipster: Trope codification of early-'90s geek-chic, emulating beatniks and the Seattle culture.
-   Hollywood Action Hero: Basically the same action heroes from the decade before, with one newcomer, Bruce Willis.
-   Hollywood Thin: Thin was in for women this decade, as shown with the svelte supermodels in the first half and the nearly emaciated "heroin chic" look in the next half.
-   Hood Film: The genre began in the 1980s but was codified in the early 1990s.
-   The Internet Is for Porn: The '90s may very well be the 2nd Sexual Revolution because of this!

-   Kids Love Dinosaurs: When _Jurassic Park_ became a box office success and the huge popularity of _Barney & Friends_ and _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ in 1992 and 1993 respectively, became a hit with kids, everything from toys and books to underwear and television shows featured dinosaurs. This got so big that when the NBA expanded into Canada in 1995, one of the new teams was named the Toronto Raptors.

-   Lighter and Softer: In America, due to the end of the Cold War and being before The War on Terror and the general affluence of the era, Nineties nostalgia tends to remember this decade as a relatively more stable and peaceful time, in contrast to the decades before and after it.
-   Lingerie Scene: The underwear-as-outerwear trend started in this decade, with articles like slips, bras and panties designed for everyday use much to the chagrin of Moral Guardians and the delight of rappers and eager men and women.
-   Little Black Dress: Especially popular in this decade.
-   Merchandise-Driven: All those toy-centered franchises in The '80s were nothing compared to Pokémon's sheer amount of commercialization; the '90s were all about this at this point.
-   Memetic Mutation: Thanks to The Internet, it could flourish.
-   Millennium Bug: In which people considered New Years 1999-2000 a set date for The End of the World as We Know It until it actually (failed to have) happened.
-   Minimalism: This style became the aesthetic force after the last two decades of over-detail and excess.
-   Music of the 1990s: Despite MTV going off-track in the decade, music remained a powerful force of expression after the turbulence of the Cold War and the excesses of 1980s consumerism, with an angsty, no-nonsense attitude and voice (though that didn't mean lighthearted fun was out of fashion). Here we have the genres that originated and/or popularized in this decade:
    -   Alternative Rock: Burst to the mainstream thanks to the success of Grunge.
    -   Brit Pop: Bands like Oasis, Blur, The Spice Girls tried to create a second British Invasion.
    -   Country Music: "The Class of '89" consisting of Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson, Clint Black, and Travis Tritt brought alternative elements to country music, Billy Ray Cyrus brought forth line dancing whiled tuned in to "Achy Breaky Heart" to the dancefloor, and later in the decade, female acts such as the Dixie Chicks, LeAnn Rimes, and Shania Twain had crossed over country, rock, and pop over to an international scale.
    -   Euro Pop: Continental bands, mostly Scandinavian bands, like Roxette, Ace of Base, and Aqua, with their sugary Word Salad Lyrics became popular in this era.
    -   Gangsta Rap: The New Rock & Roll of the early nineties, causing quite a moral panic, most memorably when Charlton Heston protested "Cop Killer" at the Time Warner shareholders' meeting.
    -   Girl Group: Girl groups almost out numbered Boy Bands in this decade. To name a few: TLC, SWV, Spice Girls, and En Vogue.
    -   The Golden Age of Hip Hop: Arguably started in the 1980s but its biggest impact was the '90s overall. Multiple styles started to emerge from different regions outside of the east coast. A large array of indie hip-hop labels found success and countless highly regarded albums came out in these years.
    -   Goth: Became mainstream in the '90s thanks to _The Crow_, Trent Reznor, Tim Burton, Marilyn Manson, Anne Rice, and Dead Can Dance.
    -   Grunge: Exploded onto the scene in the early Nineties, then quickly collapsed onto itself and became Post-Grunge by the end of the decade. _Nevermind_ was the biggest and most influential album of the decade.
    -   House Music: Popularized by Madonna in her single, "Vogue", the genre remained popular throughout the decade, spawning sub-genres like deep house, rave, and acid house.
    -   Intercourse with You: Many of the biggest hits of the '90s had sexual lyrics that were more explicit than earlier decades. The music videos themselves also featured more and more scantily clad women moving their breasts and buttocks around.
    -   New Age: Taking advantage of the post-Cold War era sentimentality and of the new experimentations of electronic music, "New Age music" that fuses elements of Ambient and World Music became en vogue during the decade.
    -   Reggae: Regained popularity during the decade. Adding elements of pop, rock, R&B, and electronic, it formed reggae fusion.
    -   R&B: A more pop-flavored version became popular, spawning "urban pop".
    -   Scatting: Always around, but it got a little boost in popularity.
    -   Techno: While developed in Detroit in the mid-80s, the genre would really begin to hit its stride in this decade, finding popularity in the European club scene.
    -   Trance: Originated in Europe in the early years of this decade and spread all over the world, spawning subgenres such as Goa trance in India and psychedelic trance in Israel. Some of the genre's biggest artists began their careers in this decade and are still going strong.
-   Must Have Caffeine: While coffee culture had its waves of impact since The Middle Ages, this decade gave coffee culture a massive boost on an international level with shows such as _Friends_ and coffeehouse franchises such as Starbucks making you want to crave a cup of espresso.
-   Nostalgia Filter: For Western millennials, this decade's clear demarcation as "pre-9/11 times" means that it will probably never lose its luster for this generation in hindsight.
-   Parodies for Dummies: The "...For Dummies" book series became popular and thus a subject for parody.
-   Postmodern Irony: The '90s were when irony went from an unheard-of artistic stance to becoming a Dead Horse Trope.
-   Real Is Brown: For an eclectic decade, the color palette of the 1990s went for a laid-back approach.
    -   If any color palette in the early to mid '90s wasn't garishly neon, or a holdover from the '80s Memphis style, it was dingy shades of brown, gray, forest green, and rust, especially within the Grunge subculture.
    -   Incidentally, shades of brown became en vogue due to coffee and the coffee culture prevailing on it.
    -   Aside from brown and tan, muted jewel tones such as garnet red, mustard, teal, denim blue, electric indigo, and raspberry became the rage, while candy colors and fluorescent colors are picked by the rave scene.
    -   As the new millennium was fast approaching, grunge colors were pushed aside in favor of metallic colors like silver and chrome, pearlescents, bubblegum pinks, sunset oranges, icy blues, and digital greens.
    -   In actuality, for the entire '90s, Real is _Teal_. From sports teams to paper cups, and from the default wallpapers of Windows 95<small>◊</small> and Windows 98<small>◊</small> to the translucent casing<small>◊</small> of the iMac G3, teal, with the occasional accents of purple, was everywhere.
-   Reality TV: Really took off in this decade, with reality itself (thanks to 24 hour news cycles, media circuses, and scandals) providing entertainment to the masses.
-   Retro Universe: This happened to former Eastern Bloc countries. Since they missed out on previous cultural decades, their Nineties were culturally an amalgamation from The '60s to the contemporary times.
-   Right-Wing Militia Fanatic: Probably one of the most infamous things about the mid-90s, coinciding with Bill Clinton's first years in office. Having a progressive (for the time) president in office at a time when gay rights, government-sponsored healthcare, and gun control became hot button issues meant that there was a significant backlash from conservative groups.
-   Satanic Panic: The final years of panic around Devil worship and perceived "counterculture".
-   Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism: Though the decade is remembered today in places like America as a happier and simpler time, the actual tone of the decade often slid back and forth between the two extremes.
-   Sleeves Are for Wimps: Was a male fanservice trope during the first half of the decade with the shirtless vest look.
-   Soul-Crushing Desk Job: After the '80s romantic portrayals of yuppies and corporate fun, media in the '90s focus on disgruntled and disassociated white collar workers, with movies being called "Cubicle films". 1999 alone is filled with cubicle films such as _The Matrix_, _American Beauty_, _Office Space_ and _Fight Club_, that deal with themes of monotony in the workplace, cynicism of corporate life, and escapism.
-   Trope Maker: Along with Trope Codifier, with The Internet and Video Games becoming a force in media, and not just mere fads, new ideas and concepts were brought by and catered to the members of Generation X and the Millennials growing up with it. Stock parodies include:
    -   I See Dead People: Popularized by _The Sixth Sense_.
    -   Kid Hero: While not a new trope, Macaulay Culkin as Kevin in _Home Alone_ really got the ball rolling. The character and the film itself spawned other films that empowered children to do decent grown-up activities, or venturing into the great outdoors by saving the environment or the places around them. The films usually end with the kids stopping the villains by using their wits or with teamwork. Video games got in on the action with Ness and Red.
    -   The Men in Black: These badasses in their nice black suits were popularized as heroes by _Men in Black_ and as villains by _The Matrix_.
    -   "Mission: Impossible" Cable Drop: Popularized by _Mission: Impossible_ (1996).
    -   NOT!: The way to sarcastically end all jokes, popularized by _Wayne's World_.
    -   Raging Stiffie: Following the creation of Sildenafil, better known by its genericized name Viagra in 1989, which was originally created to alleviate hypertension only to find out it alleviated erectile dysfunction, men were delighted, and sex comedies, and internet porn, followed suit when the drug was approved using the side effect in 1998.
    -   Seinfeldian Conversation: Popularized not just by the trope namer, but also Pulp Fiction.
    -   The 'Verse: This is the decade where works with a Shared Universe started getting traction. _X-Men: The Animated Series_, _Iron Man: The Animated Series_, _Fantastic Four: The Animated Series_, and _Spider-Man: The Animated Series_ had plenty of Crossovers, making them predecessors to Marvel Comics adaptations with such concept (which would _really_ take-off the following decade). _Super Sentai_ introduced the concept of having the Crisis Crossover between the current and previous year's team during the middle of the decade. The very end of the decade was when _Angel_ premiered, officially launching the _BuffyVerse_. Concurrently, the _Law & Order_ franchise's very first Spin-Off also premiered.
    -   You Can't Handle the Parody: Popularized by _A Few Good Men_.
-   Unkempt Beauty: A 70s trend that returned big after women spent the previous decade wearing heavy amounts of make-up.
-   Vapor Wear: Another '70s trend that returned. Many women went braless or wore bras with material thin enough for nipples to be visible. Some even used fake nipples!
-   Video Games of the 1990s: As video games became more sophisticated, more technologically and visually appealing, and more widespread; ranging from the arcade platform, to the home console, to the handhelds, to the personal computer; the industry became an inevitable force of media, spawning new genres and tropes with it. The era gave us:
    -   4X: The genre was popularized by the first installment of _Civilization_ in 1991.
    -   Adventure Games: All the rage prior to _Doom_ and the triumph of the First-Person Shooter. Though really a carryover from The '80s.
    -   American Kirby Is Hardcore: Developed in the '90s.
    -   Console Wars: Practically began in earnest with Sega Genesis vs. Super Nintendo. Genesis Does What Nintendon't, anyone?
    -   Fighting Game: Popularized by _Street Fighter_ and _Mortal Kombat_.
    -   First-Person Shooter: Pioneered by _Wolfenstein 3-D_ and _Doom_.
    -   Mascot with Attitude: Every annoying video game character made was this. Some of the best remembered include Crash Bandicoot, Jazz Jackrabbit, Sonic The Hedgehog, and Spyro the Dragon.
    -   Pop Up Video Games: Video games introduced pop-ups in this decade.
    -   Real-Time Strategy: Although the genre originated in the 80s, games such as _Warcraft_, _StarCraft_, _Command & Conquer_, and _Age of Empires_ wouldn't have been popular if not for _Dune II_ in 1992.
    -   Rhythm Game: _DanceDanceRevolution_ revolutionized this genre.
    -   Simulation Game: The genre in its modern form came to be with _SimCity_ in 1989.
    -   Survival Horror: _Resident Evil_ coined the term in 1996.
-   Western Animation of the 1990s: Coincided almost precisely with this decade, with the debut of _The Simpsons_ which catered adult-oriented entertainment in 1989, Nickelodeon's debut of _Rugrats_ in 1991, the launching of Cartoon Network in 1992, and Disney starting their "Disney Renaissance" with _The Little Mermaid_ in 1989 and finishing with _Tarzan_ in 1999.
-   Why We Are Bummed Communism Fell: After the USSR officially ended in late 1991, many factions in the West were left without a common enemy to unite against, and the value of NATO (originally formed to combat the Soviets) was soon called into question. Over in Eastern Europe, meanwhile, Russia and the former members of the Soviet Bloc were left to pick up the pieces of the Soviet Union's collapse, leaving many people in the older generations nostalgic for the "good old days".
    -   Predictably, several works of fiction in the 1990s tackled the end of the Cold War. _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_ (which follows the drama of the Federation and Klingon Empire sueing for peace) went into production around the time the Iron Curtain was falling, and was released mere days before the Soviet Union dissolved. _James Bond_ films made after 1991 picked up a Central Theme of 007 and secret agents like him becoming increasingly irrelevant now that the Reds were gone.
-   "X" Makes Anything Cool: Alongside Xtremely Kool Letterz, media in this decade totally milked this naming convention to appeal towards the Generation **X**.

It made its debut in the WWF on September 1991 when then champion Ric Flair took it with him after having a fallout with NWA, though WWF won't use it until a decade later. The original red-brown strap would be replaced with a new black strap in 1999 (even though, by that point, the original strap had turned black anyway.)
-   Grand Slam Champion: Shawn Michaels became the first ever wrestler to achieve this feat in 1997, both in the WWF/E and pro wrestling in general.
-   Hell in a Cell: The match debuted during the main event of the aforementioned _Bad Blood_, but the most famous match is considered to be the one from the 1998 _King of the Ring_.
-   Triple Crown Champion: A lot of wrestlers achieved this feat in the decade.
    -   For the WWF/E, Bret Hart became the first wrestler to achieve this feat in 1992. He is then followed by Diesel (1994), Shawn Michaels (1996), Steve Austin (1998) and The Rock (1999).
    -   For WCW, Ric Flair became the first wrestler to achieve this feat in January 1991. He is then followed by Lex Luger (also in 1991, July to be precise), Sting (1992), DDP, Goldberg and Bret Hart (all in 1999).

    Radio 

-   It was during this time that _The Howard Stern Show_ started to become nationally syndicated and eventually became highest-rated nationally syndicated morning radio show in most major radio markets the United States.
-   Chris Evan's (in)famous BBC Radio One Breakfast Show from 1995 until 1997. Initially credited with "saving" the station (the hugely-popular national station had suffered a drop in listeners following a serious shake-up under Matthew Bannister starting in 1993 in his attempt to re-position Radio One as a "youth" network following two decades of it being a "housewife's favourite"; Evan's show co-incided with an upturn in listener numbers) he increasingly became egotistical, dismissive of BBC and general broadcasting guidelines and often took what many thought was a bullying attitude to his on-air colleagues. Things eventually came to a head when he and the rest of his staff refused to come in for a Friday morning show leading to someone else having to cover for him. Evans was subsequently sacked and his career took a long, very slow nosedive which culminated in several flopped attempts at TV "comebacks" in the 2000s. He has now reached middle age, has regained much (if not all) of his former popularity and hosts the Radio Two Breakfast Show. He apparently regrets many of his past mistakes and behaviour.
-   During this time, Rush Limbaugh became a nationally syndicated star of talk radio who gave the medium an ideological bent that was unchallenged until the middle of the next decade. (Limbaugh also was popular in the mainstream media for a period in this decade, including being given a television show that aired during President Clinton's first term.)
-   This was the decade in which Shock Jock Howard Stern became the "King Of All Media" from his radio base in New York; he set the way for many imitators. (The radio show was also broadcast on TV for a time; something which even Limbaugh could not claim.)
-   Neal Boortz began his show in 1993.
-   _Sherlock Holmes (BBC Radio)_, which began in 1989, continued until 1998.
-   The third installment of the _Star Wars Radio Dramas_, adapting _Return of the Jedi_, aired in 1996 after spending a decade in Development Hell thanks to Reagan-era cuts to NPR's funding.
-   _Says You!_ began in 1997.
-   _Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me_ began in 1998.
-   _Phoenix (1954)_
