**Sokka:** I'm too young to die!  
**Old Fisherman:** I'm not, but I still don't wanna!

A character bemoans the fact that they are too young to die and that they have yet to experience life fully when faced with danger or death. The things they wish they would have done before their life are often things like traveling, personal goals, and love/sex.

When played dramatically, this is often used to set up a tragic character or be a catalyst for character development if the character ends up not dying.

When played for comedy, this trope often used when a character faces unusual punishment or humiliation. Sometimes the character(s) in question lament about being too young to die to avoid punishment or simply trying to get out of doing something they don't want to do. In some shows, they replace the die part of the "I'm too young to die" phrase to another word that fits the situation for laughs.

See also Death of a Child, Too Good for This Sinful Earth, and Littlest Cancer Patient, for characters who literally are too young. May overlap with Must Not Die a Virgin, where characters rush to have sex thinking that they will otherwise die as virgins.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_: During the lowest point of their training, Alphonse says he doesn't want to die because there is so much he still hasn't done that he wants to.
-   _Gunslinger Girl_ is about little girls who have been converted via cybernetics into Super-Soldier assassins at the cost of a much shorter lifespan, so none of them will ever become adults. In one scene Angelica is in hospital and the other girls have come to visit her. Depressed because her handler has rejected her, Angelica starts crying that they are all going to die without knowing anything about life. Her friends just stand embarrassed until Claes punches Angelica in the face. Claes later visits Angelica in private and admits that despite her stoic facade, she's just as scared of pain and death as Angelica is.
-   In _Love Pistols_, the main character, Norio, gets into a scooter accident. As he realises his life is in danger, he quickly realises he doesn't want to die a virgin, "without ever knowing the soft, sweet figure of a woman, and tasting—"... well, he gets detailed.
-   In _Sailor Moon_, the heroines are about to leave for the Arctic to face Queen Beryl, and start to think about the very real possibility of not coming back and how young they are at the time. They don´t expressly lament about sex but they do think about who they, even Ami, might have wanted to kiss before having to go and fight.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Transformers (Marvel)_: In issue #59, Blurr once laments that he is too young to die, as he is "only" 4 million years old. While it sounds like it was intended for comedy, given the ridiculous length of time that is to a human, it actually isn't. Cybertronians are so ridiculously long-lived that a million years is very close to their age equivalent of a human decade. As such, Blurr is reasonably dismayed at the prospect of being blown up by Decepticons in what would be his early 40s.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Miraculous Ladybug_ fic _New Year's Dance_ by Thelastpilot, Adrien thinks that he's just a boy and too young to die when he sees Marinette arriving as his date for the gala. Not played seriously; he's merely about to see her all dressed up.
-   _Iron Touch_ combines this with Ain't Too Proud to Beg. After Hol Horse catches Sara stealing from him, she starts rattling off excuses and begs him not to shoot her, including a bit where she invokes this trope.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Shrek_, where Fiona points out Shrek having an arrow stuck in his butt, to which Donkey begins to panic, and even exclaims, "I'm too young for you to die!"
-   Played for Laughs and inverted in _Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa_, as the elderly Nana tells the tourists she refuses to stay out in the open, and get attacked by more animals, claiming she's _too old to die_.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _The A-Team_, B.A. yells "I'm too young to die!" as the freefalling tank he's in gets buttoned down by the rest of the team in preparation to try to "fly" it via parachutes and Recoil Boost.
-   _Haunted Mansion (2023)_: Inverted when Bruce says "I'm too old to die!" Later, it's also played straight when Travis says "I'm too young to die!"
-   _Interview with the Vampire_. In the "Théâtre des Vampires" production it's strongly implied the vampires kill and feed upon the young human actress on stage. One of the vampires is playing Death.
    
    **Actress:** But I'm too young!
    
    **Death:** Death is no respecter of age.
    
-   In Kenneth Branagh's film adaptation of _The Magic Flute_, Papageno often insists he is too young to die as a Running Gag.
    
    **The Three Ladies:** You, Papageno, death surrounds you!  
    **Papageno:** No, no, no, I'm far too young!
    
-   _The Three Stooges:_
    -   This is a common exclamation for Curly and Shemp when they're placed in especially lethal predicaments. They initially claim that they're also "too handsome," but after some (literal) reflection, they settle for "too young."
    -   A variation: Larry once complained that he couldn't die because he hadn't yet seen _The Jolson Story_.

    Literature 

-   Before Johnny from _The Outsiders_ dies, he says that, although he used to talk about killing himself, he now realizes that sixteen isn't old enough to do all the things he wanted to do.
-   _Wild Cards_: When Jetboy fails to save New York from Dr. Tod, resulting in the release of Xenovirus Takis-A, his last words are, "I can't die yet - I haven't seen _The Jolson Story_." These words end up engraved upon his tomb.
-   "Seventeen", an essay by John J. Berrio about the post-mortem reflections of a teenaged driver who had just been killed in a car accident. Focusing on driver safety and responsibility, the teen recalls how he boasted that driving was a sign of freedom and he could take chances, but now that he has paid the price of reckless driving with his life, he can see that he will be losing out on life and its many opportunities and that he has left behind many grieving family and friends. As he is being buried, he begs God for another chance, vowing to do better: "Please God, don't take me ... I'm only 17!" In the years since its original publication –- Berrio wrote the piece in 1967, reportedly after a friend lost his son in a car accident –- "Seventeen" (aka "Dead At Seventeen", "Please God, I'm Only Seventeen" and other titles) has appeared multiple times in advice columns (including Dear Abby, Ann Landers (and its successor, Annie's Mailbox) and Dr. Robert Wallace's 'Tween 12 and 20, always at the request of parents and teachers who want to impart driving safety onto teenagers), and has been adapted into both musical prose and television specials.
-   This is the central source of tension in the second _Young Wizards_ novel, _Deep Wizardry_. The protagonist accidentally signs herself up for a Heroic Sacrifice and gets practically a whole page of quite lovely verse on the central dilemma: "Not old enough to love as yet, / But old enough to die indeed." Averted in the end when the guy who eventually performs the Heroic Sacrifice is really, really old — like just-out-of-the-Primordial-Slime old.
-   In _Zuleika Dobson_, when the whole university decides to commit suicide for love of the eponymous lady, Noaks keeps saying that he's too young to die, despite the fact that half of the suicides-to-be are in fact younger than him.
-   In _The Curse of the Cheese Pyramid_, Geronimo thinks one when he suspects his Dirt Cheap Airlines flight is about to crash. The experiences he laments missing out on are climbing Mouse Everest, "trekking through the great Mousewood Forest," and eating a box of popsicles he just bought.
-   At the beginning of _A Wizard of Earthsea_, the protagonist laments that he is about to die as a child when a band of enemies approaches his village. Fortunately, he figures out in time how to use his limited magical knowledge to drive them off.
-   _The Master Sniper_ by Stephen Hunter. A Nazi soldier remembers watching Jews file into an execution pit, and a young girl says quietly, "Twenty-three years old." Assuming she's referring to this trope, he just thinks that everyone's too young to die and opens fire.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _ABC Afterschool Special_: A 1992 episode was a dramatic adaptation of John J. Berrio's "Seventeen" essay, again focusing on his post-mortem reflections and promising to heed driving safety and traffic laws (as he was supposed taught to but chose instead to ignore) if God would grant him a second chance.
-   In the first _Bottom_ live show, Richie says he doesn't want to die upon discovering he is marked for death by a debt collector. He then follows with a Preemptive "Shut Up" when Eddie is about to counter this claim.
-   _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_: Gina attempts to invoke this trope in the episode Lockdown.
    
    **Gina:** I'm twenty-five years old, I'm a celebrity, and I'm going to die.  
    **Rosa:** Not one of those things is true.
    
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: In the season 1 finale, Buffy learns of a prophecy that she will face the Master and die in the process. She tries to get out of this by outright quitting and walking away, not ready to face death at such a young age.
    
    **Giles:** Buffy, if the Master rises...  
    **Buffy:** I don't care! _\[calms down\]_ I don't care. _\[softly\]_ Giles, I'm sixteen years old. I don't wanna die.
    
-   On _Cheers_ Rebecca and her sister play a prank on Sam in which Rebecca pretends to shoot her sister. To sell the act, Rebecca's sister screams "I'm too young to die" just before Rebecca pulls the trigger.
-   _The Good Place_: In the episode "Dance Dance Resolution", someone has to get in an obelisk sent by the Bad Place. Jason bemoans that he's too young to die, ignoring the fact that he and the other characters are already dead and in the afterlife.
    
    **Jason:** I can't go! I'm too young to die! And too old to eat off the kids' menu! _What a stupid age I am!_
    
-   _House of Anubis_: In an episode following Patricia's kidnapping and ensuing rescue, she has a minor PTSD freakout when the Sibunas get taken to and locked in Victor's office under mysterious circumstances. In response to Patricia demanding she be let out, Amber jumps on the bandwagon and claims she's "Too young and too pretty to die."
-   A running gag in _The Mighty Boosh_ is Howard lamenting "Don't kill me, I have so much to give" whenever he's threatened with death (almost Once per Episode). This fits with his characterization as a self-aggrandizing Miles Gloriosus who talks big but inevitably fails or chickens out when faced with actual danger. This is milked for extra Hypocritical Humor in "Bollo", where he gives this lament when the grim reaper comes for him, after declaring earlier in the episode that he would Face Death with Dignity if death, hypothetically, arrived.
-   Played for laughs in the _Red Dwarf_ episode "Future Echoes", where Dave Lister goes into details about all the things he'd always meant to do but won't if he dies now. "And I've never read... a book."
-   In _Sledge Hammer!_ episode "Sledge Rattle 'n Roll", a rock band's airplane crashed and got the band killed. When the police officers listen to the Blackbox recording, we hear one of the band members crying that he was too young to die and hasn't seen Europe yet. He gets reminded by another member that he actually is from Europe. Watch the scene here.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_. In "Message in a Bottle", the Emergency Medical Hologram has to work with the Mark Two EMH, who has only been online for six weeks. Because the Doctor had given a List-of-Experiences Speech earlier, when it looks like they're both going to be blown up by Romulan warbirds the Mark Two starts moaning: "My brilliant existence cut short! No time to explore the universe, no time to smell the roses, no time for...sex!"
-   _Walker, Texas Ranger_: Several episodes where child or teenage victims are in deadly situations, fearing they are about to die (before always being rescued by Walker, natch).
    -   One example considered to be the most infamous was in the Season 4's "Deadline", where Lindsay Hughes, teenaged daughter of state senator Warren Hughes, is Buried Alive in a coffin with a short supply of air (in an attempt by that episode's bad guy to extort millions from her father). After a commercial break –- the senator had just been given false information as to where his daughter is buried –- the scene focuses on the daughter, having been buried for several hours. The thought of what was likely going through her mind at that moment –- very likely, contemplating her death, never being with friends again, getting married and having children, being denied her dreams and goals in life, and the fact that if by lucky chance she is rescued, she will live with PTSD for the rest of her life and face the evil man that did this to her in court –- is downright chilling, frightening and nightmarish. She barely survived after she was exhumed.
    -   Another nightmarish example is Season 9's "6 Hours", which detailed another frightened college-bound teenager, Heather Preston, being kidnapped by her deranged traitorous bodyguard, McNeely, taken to an Abandoned Warehouse and strapped into an old broken electric chair placed in front of a shotgun that will pop up to kill her within six hours on live television unless her father paid a ransom. To make things go From Bad to Worse, McNeely had no plans to release Heather even after the ransom was paid, but instead let the whole world watch in full view of her praying and screaming for help while he flees the country. As usual, Walker shows up just in time as the timer nears zero, and at the literal last second during the final fight, he turns McNeely around so he is killed by his own deathtrap.

    Music

-   The Eagles song "James Dean", about the well-known actor, is all about how he was "too fast to live, but too young to die".
-   "Arrow Through the Heart", a song recorded by Andy Gibb in July 1987 while he was attempting a comeback, says "I'm too young to die" twice in succession. It proved to be his last recording, as he would die less than a year later, making the phrase sadly prophetic. The song was largely unknown until an excerpt from it was included in a _Behind the Music_ profile of Gibb, and would not be officially released until being included in _Mythology_, a 2010 box set of songs by him and his older brothers, the Bee Gees.
-   "Seasons in the Sun", a No. 1 pop hit by Terry Jacks from the winter of 1974, is a lamentation of a young man dying and having to say goodbye to loved ones.

Even though he was almost 60 when he recorded it, country music legend Red Sovine comes up with a convincing interpretation of the teenager who now can only watch post-mortem as he now realizes what he has lost by driving recklessly.
-   "'Til I'm Too Old to Die Young" by Moe Bandy, a 1987 country hit wherein a middle-aged man reflects on his fears of dying young and how he wants to be able to see his children into adulthood ("_to see what they become_"), meet his grandchildren and so forth. He also takes time to remember beloved family and friends who had died young, recalling what it was like to grieve their passings, and shows gratitude for each day he does get to live.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Fraggle Rock_: In the episode "I Want to Be You", Boober and Wembley both make this after thinking they've caught a rare, highly contagious disease called bacterial sufferorsis. The symptoms include funny hair and a weird voice.

    **Boober:** _\[holding an ice pack to his head\]_ Ohhh, my hair is killing me! And my voice is disgusting! Ohhh, I'm too young to die!  
    **Wembley:** Ohhh, me, too!  
    **Boober:** Quick! Bring the crushed rock!
