**The Oldest Ones in the Book**  
Older Than the NES | Before 1985

Older Than Television | 1890 — 1939  
Older Than Radio | 1698 — 1890  
Older Than Steam | 1439 — 1698  
**Older Than Print** | 476 — 1439  
Older Than Feudalism | ~800 BC — 476 AD  
Older Than Dirt | Before ~800 BC

From the fall of Rome during the 5th century (c. 476 CE) to the invention of movable-type printing. The precise dates vary from region to region, but this was a time when literacy was low and books were rare and cost a king's ransom. In the era before movable type, most documents were hand-written, so if you were a wealthy, educated Blue Blood or church leader and you wanted to read a book, you got your scribes to _hand copy_ the book. Most Western folklore originated here, often echoing earlier tropes. Chivalric Romance and Courtly Love developed in this era.

Note: this is older than _Johannes Gutenberg's printing press_ (1439 CE), not metal movable-type characters (ca. 1230 CE, Korea), movable-type printing (1040 CE, China), and certainly not wood-block printing (220 CE or earlier, China again). These earlier printing methods could be used to cut down the cost of reproduction to 90 percent lower than hand-copying, but they each had drawbacks. Wood blocks used for printing had to be laboriously carved by hand, and then they'd wear out and have to re-carve the entire page.

In short, the Middle Ages — assuming you don't take Petrarch's definition for it, as he lived in the 1300s. Even all things Shakespeare, Don Quixote, and many late medieval and high Renaissance era books are only Older Than Steam.

Specific works from this time period include:

-   _The Arabian Nights_, mostly (though "Aladdin" and "Ali Baba" have no known source before Galland's Older Than Radio French translation.)
-   _Beowulf_
-   _The Canterbury Tales_ by Geoffrey Chaucer
-   Almost everything we know of Celtic Mythology and Norse Mythology was first written down during this period.

-   _The Divine Comedy_ by Dante Alighieri

-   The Hindu Puranas were composed in more-or-less their present form during the centuries before about 1000 CE, although their origins and some portions of the texts go back to at least 300 BCE.
-   The _Kojiki_ and _Nihon Shoki_, which chronicle most of Japanese Mythology and the nation's early history, were first compiled in 711-712 and 720 CE respectively.
-   The Qur'an. It was orally transmitted throughout the Prophet's lifetime and was only codified by his successors. Final canonization was done during the reign of caliph Uthman (644-656 CE).

-   Side Effects Include...: The 6th-century Chinese medical text _Records of the Rock Chamber_ list the following side effects for an alleged elixir of immortality, and suggests that this means the elixir is working:
    
    After taking an elixir, if your face and body itch as though insects were crawling over them, if your hands and feet swell dropsically, if you cannot stand the smell of food and bring it up after you have eaten it, if you feel as though you were going to be sick most of the time, if you experience weakness in the four limbs, if you have to go often to the latrine, or if your head or stomach violently ache—do not be alarmed or disturbed.

Much of the standard vocabulary of fantasy is even ripped directly from the tales of the Norsemen, with terms like "Elf" and "Dwarf" derived from the Old Norse _"Alfar"_ and _"Dvergr"_; even "Middle Earth" is a literal English translation of the Old Norse _"Midgard"_.

-   Tears of Blood: A common trope in Heian era Japanese literature, for example _The Tale of Genji_. Also shed by Kriemhild for her husband Siegfried in _Nibelungenlied_, and by Aslaug for her stepsons in _The Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok_.
-   The New Rock & Roll: In the 12th century, the Church denied all sacraments, including last rites, to all minstrels and street performers, effectively damning them all to Hell. The reason? Supposedly, what they did was unproductive and seduced people away from a "proper" Christian life. During the Middle Ages, musicians were seen as corruptors of youth who presumably learned their skills in Hell.
-   Thieving Magpie: _The Arabian Nights_ story "the Stolen Necklace".
-   "The Reason You Suck" Speech: In pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, the poetic form of _Hijaa'_, although called satire by more polite historians, is actually a kind of insult poetry directed at an enemy, explaining all the reasons why he was an awful, terrible, dishonorable, no-good human being. Like satire, _Hijaa'_ is supposed to be funny to the general audience, but it was mostly supposed to be read or heard by its target, who would be gravely insulted. Essentially the world's first diss tracks.
-   Third Eye: The Hindu _Matsya Purana_ tells of the fear of the gods when Shiva mourned unceasingly for his dead wife Sati, because a prophecy stated that a new son of Shiva was needed to save the gods from a coming catastrophe. Kama, god of love, shot Shiva to make him fall in love with Parvati, so Shiva grew a third eye and burnt him to a crisp with Eye Beams.
-   Throwing Off the Disability: Thórhall Ásgrimsson of _Njal's Saga_ is so infuriated that the Burners of Njál and his household have evaded a sentence of outlawry by exploiting a technicality that he drives a spear through the boil on his foot which made him walk with a cane, then storms off without a cane and without limping and kills the first man of the Burners he meets.
-   Throwing Your Sword Always Works: From Norse heroic legend: When the hero Sigurd is stabbed in his sleep, he throws his sword after the fleeing murderer that cuts him clean in two. The incident is related identically in the _Prose Edda_, _Poetic Edda_ and _Völsunga saga_.
-   Trading Bars for Stripes: One of the earliest known examples comes from the Ottoman Empire in Real Life. The bashi-bazouk were a type of irregular soldier dating back to the 1300s who were recruited from criminals, vagrants, and the homeless. Instead of being salaried, their pay consisted solely of whatever they could steal.
-   Translation with an Agenda: Many translations of _The Bible_ are accused of this.
-   Trick-Taking Card Game: Records of such games existing in China date back to the early second millenium.
-   Turn Out Like His Father: Some variants of Percival, from Arthurian Legend.
-   Unable to Cry: In the "First Lay of Gudrun" of the _Poetic Edda_, Gudrun does not weep over her murdered husband Sigurd. Several women attempt to console her by relating her own sad stories, but fail to get a reaction. Only when Gudrun's sister uncovers the dead Sigurd's face does Gudrun weep.
-   Uptown Girl: Prince Justinian I married Theodora, a low-class actress/prostitute. As emperor he actually abolished the laws prohibiting their marriage.
-   Valkyries: May have dated from earlier, but the age of Vikings was in full-swing during this period, and most Norse Mythology was codified and recorded during this period.
-   Viking Funeral: The first instances are the funerals of King Scyld Scefing of Denmark in _Beowulf_ (no fire), of the god Baldur in _Snorra Edda_ (fire), and of King Haki of Sweden in _Heimskringla_ (fire. Probably neither variant represents real-life burial customs).
-   Villainous Breakdown: In _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_, Zhou Yu is completely unhinged by the failure of his last plan against Zhuge Liang. Zhou Yu's rage causes a wound to reopen and he sickens and dies shortly thereafter.
-   Wacky Fratboy Hijinks: The first recognizable Western universities were founded in the High Middle Ages, as far back as the 11th–13th centuries... and already students were being condemned for drunkenness, getting into violent brawls, and engaging in all sorts of mistreatment of women, up to and including rape. It was worse in some ways because medieval university students in those days were younger on average than their modern descendants.
-   We Named the Monkey "Jack": _The Saga of Hrolf Kraki_ has Queen Olof of Saxony bearing a baby daughter after being raped. She names the girl Yrsa after one of her dogs and has her raised as a serf.
-   Where da White Women At?: In the framing story of the _Arabian Nights_, as well as within more than one tale. The women in question are Persian, but the dynamic with black male slaves is the same.
-   Who Needs Their Whole Body?: In the Arthurian story of _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_, the Green Knight gets beheaded and then calmly talks and walks while carrying his head.
-   Wife Husbandry: Hikaru Genji does this with/to Murasaki in _The Tale of Genji_. King Conchobar of Ulster tries to do this with Deirdre in _The Exile of the Sons of Uisnech_, but it doesn't work.
-   The Wild Hunt: Unequivocal instances of this trope date to this era, the oldest probably found in the _Bhagavata Purana_ of Hindu literature (9th or 10th century), where mention is made of a travelling army of ghosts, headed by Shiva. For Europe, this supernatural phenomenon is probably first described by the chronicler Ordericus Vitalis in the 1130s.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   William Telling: The earliest instance is that of Palnatoki or Toko, recorded in the 12th century in Saxo Grammaticus' _Danish History_. William Tell, in contrast, is first described performing the feat in the 15th century in the _White Book Of Sarnen_.
-   Wishplosion: In the original _Arabian Nights_ a man's wife gets rid of an evil genie by wishing he would straighten out a single hair. (In today's age of salons, this wouldn't work.)
-   A Wizard Did It: The Man of Law's Tale from _The Canterbury Tales_. Constance was alone on a ship, adrift at sea, for years. Why didn't the ship sink? Why didn't she run out of food or fresh water? Conclusion: Jesus did it.
-   World of Funny Animals: _Reynard the Fox_ features both anthropomorphic animals as well as plenty of stuff that would not be out of place in an actual city such as houses, churches and an actual court. Although the story is not funny in the slightest.
-   You All Meet in an Inn: The pilgrims in _The Canterbury Tales_, and Liu Bei and his (future) sworn brothers in _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_.
-   You Cannot Kill An Idea: Quoth Odin in the _Poetic Edda_ (more specifically, in the poem _Hávamál_): "Cattle die, kinsmen die, you yourself will also die; but the fair fame never dies of him who has earned it."
-   Youth Is Wasted on the Dumb: In _Beowulf_, the eponymous hero describes his and his cousin's swimming across the sea as something they did when they were young and prideful.
