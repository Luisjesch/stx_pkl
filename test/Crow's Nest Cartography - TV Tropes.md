Due to the non-linear nature of open-world video games, developers will often create certain in-game limitations in order to gate player progress. The most common version of this is the "Ubisoft Tower," a location on that map that, when cleared, will unveil large portions of the map. This is a two-part feature: on one hand, this creates an easy template for challenging the player, as the developers can re-use the location multiple times but in different variations in order to create new content, and to center the interesting content of the game world around the tower so players are gravitated towards them.

Visiting these towers typically does two things. First, it reveals a large section of the in-game map for the player to see, often revealing objectives, side-quests, and other such activities for the player to engage in, in such a way that doesn't overwhelm them by giving them the entire map's worth at once. Second, it typically provides a Warp Whistle location for players to come back to, allowing them to seek out the different objectives, clear them, and then return to find another.

May overlap with Video Game Vista if it allows the player to see gorgeous scenery from high up as a way of making the world feel bigger and more expansive.

## Examples of this trope include:

    open/close all folders 

     Ubisoft 

-   Ubisoft both made and codified the trope, as almost all of their game series include these, hence their nickname "Ubisoft Towers".
    -   _Assassin's Creed_ is the first series in which they came to prominence, where they are named "Viewpoints". When climbed by Altair, Ezio, and other player characters, they reveal sections of the map and allow them to track objectives.
        -   _Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood_ adds onto this with "Borgia Towers", which have to be destroyed before Ezio can pay to open shops in the area.
        -   _Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag_ features viewpoints and also naval strongholds, which have to be conquered by Edward Kenway in order to reveal portions of the ocean map to reveal locations and collectibles when using the _Jackdaw_.
        -   In _Unity_ and _Syndicate_, Synchronisation reveals various opportunities and details and the environment that you can use to execute your mission (such as "you can steal the keys from that nurse" or "you can rescue these guys to create a distraction").
        -   In _Origins_ and _Odyssey_, the Synchronization points are also used for fast-travelling, making traversing the massive open worlds much easier.
    -   _Far Cry_:
        -   In the third and fourth installments, these are known as "radio" and "bell" towers respectively. Both reveal more of the map, liberate weapons in the area, and reveal more objectives.
        -   Lampshaded but ultimately averted in _Far Cry 5_. An early mission has the player climb a tower to activate an antenna as part of a story mission, with Dutch joking how the player must think he'll have them do that all over the county — in clear reference to the notorious presence of this being a regular mechanic in other Ubisoft games, but this game in fact has no such mechanic.
    -   _Immortals Fenyx Rising_: Clearing out the fog from the map requires you to climb massive statues of the Gods, though finding collectibles can done with the Farsight ability which can be used anywhere.
    -   _Watch\_Dogs_ uses CTOS towers to reveal collectibles and the map.

     Non-Ubisoft examples 

-   _Batman: Arkham Origins_ has jammed transmission towers Batman needs to hack in order to unlock fast travel.
-   _Genshin Impact_ has "Statues of the Seven", which reveal more of the map, act as fast travel points, _and_ heal the party if you ask them nicely. The heal function can be toggled so merely teleporting to a statue heals your characters. Ordinary "teleport waypoints" merely do fast travel. Both can be seen on unrevealed areas of the map, but only activate when visited in person. Unlike most other examples however, it doesn't need (or made) to be climbed on, though a few Statues are located high up in places that can only be reached by climbing.
-   _Halo Infinite_ plays this completely straight, except the FOB's are low to the ground. They also double as bases where you can call in vehicles and weapons and gather marines.
-   _Horizon Zero Dawn_ and its sequel, _Horizon Forbidden West_, has the Tallnecks. Large giraffe-like machines with Saucer-shaped heads who gather telemetry from all the other robotic wildlife in the region. They patrol around ruins, and the player has to climb the ruins they circle, then jump onto the passing Tallneck to then scale its titular neck to the saucer section and thus get map information. They are basically a (slightly) mobile version of this trope.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: The "Sheikah Towers" require Link to climb them and insert his Sheikah Slate into a terminal at the top. Unlike Ubisoft, in which visiting these points reveal a typically-circular portion of the map and unlock objectives, visiting a Sheikah Tower fills in the borders of an entire region, and does _not_ add objectives to the map. Instead, the player has to manually scout out where shrines and other points of interest are, putting more emphasis on exploration, rather than ticking off a checklist of objectives. Since they are Warp Whistle destinations, they also double as convenient high points for Link to use his paraglider. In addition, _reaching_ these towers is often a challenge by itself, as various obstacles (such as being covered in Malice or thorny vines, heavily guarded or located in a Bottomless Pit) make each tower a puzzle to solve.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_ does it a little bit differently with its "Skyview Towers". Link still finds towers and Link does still survey the land from a great height, but he no longer has to actually climb the tower (most of the time). Instead, the tower itself blasts him into the air and Link uses the Purah Pad to scan the surrounding landscape. Like its predecessor, it doesn't fill anything in on the map, merely uncovering a section for the player to see the topography of, but these towers also serve as excellent places to vault Link into the sky so he can make his way to the many sky islands floating above Hyrule.
-   _Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor_ and its sequel _Shadow of War_ use _Barad-Silme_ or "forge towers" to reveal the map, reveal collectibles, and function as respawn and quicktravel locations.
-   In _Sable_, cartographers always land their balloons on the highest natural landmarks they can find. If you reach them, you can buy a map of the area.
-   _Spider-Man (PS4)_ has Radio Towers Spider-Man needs to find and hack, which reveal all objectives in their vicinity and allow Spider-Man to respond to crimes in progress. This being a Spider-Man game, there's not that much climbing involved since you'll be web-slinging at rooftop levels to begin with.
-   _State of Decay_ uses the same "manual scout" feature as _Breath of the Wild_ well years before its release. It's however optional except for the tutorial, as both the minimap and full map will automatically reveal points of interest.
-   In _Submerged: Hidden Depths_, when you climb a lookout tower and light the fire, nearby secrets are revealed.
