**Girls**: And me. And me too. And me.  
**Dingo**: Yes. Yes, you must give us all a good spanking.

**Galahad**: Well, I could stay a bit longer...

Corporal Punishment appears in fiction in various contexts. This trope concerns spanking adults as Fanservice, consensual or involuntary, that plays up to the audiences' fetishes. It might be an excuse from the creators to focus on the (often bare) bottom and show the audience power-play between people who are sexually attracted to each other.

It might happen that an adult, usually a beautiful lady, has done something stupid or childish, and someone else believes they have to punish them. However, instead of doing it with words, they give them a good old-fashioned spanking. It's usually not too severe and might be taken for fun. Someone who's into it might even engage in Mischief for Punishment.

Another use is when a romantic couple likes to spice up their sex life, and spanking is a thing they both enjoy. Hopefully Safe, Sane, and Consensual. Spanking is usually enjoyed by those who love to play with the boundaries of pain, punishment, and pleasure. A Dominatrix might also offer this as one of her services.

A Subtrope of Corporal Punishment and Casual Kink. Sister Trope to Don't Make Me Take My Belt Off!. Sometimes this trope might overlap with Comedic Spanking, or Fetishes Are Weird if the person into the activity is portrayed as weird. Compare Flirtatious Smack on the Ass, Friendly Tickle Torture, Prank Punishment, and Power Dynamics Kink.

Obviously Truth in Television, but that's about as far as we can go. For that reason, No Real Life Examples, Please!.
