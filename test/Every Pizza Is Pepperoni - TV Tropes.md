Shame these pizzas aren't real.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Think about pizza. What kind of toppings would you put on it? Pepperoni, of course! In fictionland, especially in cartoons and video games, that's apparently the only choice you have, save for the occasional mushrooms or green bell pepper — but never not in addition to the pepperoni. It seems as if the general image of pepperoni on pizza is so entrenched in our expectations that generic background pizza always looks like pepperoni pizza.

A possible reason this is a thing is it's just easier to make art of pizza look like pizza by drawing pepperoni on it, as thanks to a beautiful little thing called the Maillard reaction<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , even a plain cheese pizza has reddish spots on it. Supporting this, while pepperoni pizza _can_ be seen in live-action works, you're more likely to see something else simply because it is easy to identify a real life pizza as pizza regardless of the toppings.

The only other toppings that seem to be mentioned are anchovies, for a classic "hold the anchovies" joke, or starting in The New '10s, pineapple as toppings, owing to a common belief that the flavors of pineapple and pizza are a poor match for one another due to the moisture of it dampening the crust and the sweetness overtaking the other flavors of the mozzarella and other toppings (in fact, pineapple on pizza just might be the most popular unpopular opinion).

A Sub-Trope of Stock Food Depictions. Compare Cartoon Meat and Cartoon Cheese for tropes about the same concept for when meat and cheese are _not_ on pizza. See also Hold the Unsolicited Ingredient for when anchovies or pineapple (or some other bizarre topping) are mentioned to specifically _not_ be put on the pizza.

This trope is somewhat less ubiquitous in anime, where the red bits on pizza are about equally likely to be either pepperonis or chunks of tomato.

Side note: "Pepperoni" in Italy means bell peppers, which would disgust any Japanese Tourist. The closest thing to what is considered "pepperoni" pizza there is "pizza diavolo", which contains salami. Pepperoni itself is a salami.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _My-HiME_ episode 16, "Parade", the girls are doing a Karaoke Party to celebrate the creation of the HiME Force (HiME Sentai in the original Japanese), to protect each other from further Orphan attacks or more threats from The Searrs Foundation. Mikoto is seen eating a pizza with pepperoni and bell peppers.
-   _Pretty Cure_ only occasionally uses this trope, as their pizzas are more frequently topped with vegetables. This is likely done to set a good example to their young audience and defy the Kids Hate Vegetables trope.
    -   Averted in Episode 30 of _HuGtto! Pretty Cure_; the Cures visit Italy, and Ruru eats some margherita pizza, which is topped with lots of cheese, tomatoes, and basil.
    -   Averted in Episode 30 of _Healin' Good♡Pretty Cure_, where Chiyu gets a veggie lovers pizza for lunch, and the red topping is red pepper rather than pepperoni.
    -   Averted in Episode 36 of _Tropical-Rouge! Pretty Cure_: While visiting the Grand Ocean, Manatsu gets some pizza with tiny bits from the ocean, like shells and bits of seaweed.

-   In the Novelization of _Turning Red_, Mei notes that, on the subject of pizza, pepperoni and cheese couldn't compare to her father's fried scallion pancakes.
-   Averted in _Free Birds_. The pizza in the film given to the Pilgrims at the first Thanksgiving to replace turkey is cheese pizza, as having pepperoni on it would just be substituting one animal death with another.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _The Goonies_: Inverted. While the Goonies are hiding in the Fratellis' basement, Chunk is able to tell that they purchased a pepperoni pizza by smelling it.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _BattleBots_: RIPperoni is a newcomer to _World Championship VII_, whose weapon is a hige spinning disk painted to resemble a pepperoni pizza.
-   _The Electric Company (2009)_ had Special Agent Jack Bowser, a bipedal blue dog inspired by Jack Bauer from _24_.

One such factory was making pizzas, all of which were topped with mushrooms and pepperoni.

    Music 

-   The "Lies" brand pizza in the video for the Evanescence song "Everybody's Fool" is audibly and visibly identified as a pepperoni one, as seen here in the opening sequence.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Sesame Street_: Instead of eating at Charlie's Restaurant, where Grover is always his waiter and tends to get the orders wrong, Fat Blue decides to have lunch at Pizzeria Dos—where, as the twin chefs explain, "you get two of everything." Order one slice of pizza, and you'll be served two slices; order one drink, and you'll be given two drinks. "I'd like a slice of pizza," says Fat Blue. Not only is he served two slices instead of just one, but both slices are topped with cheese, pepperoni, and nothing else.

    Toys 

-   _Transformers: BotBots_: Duderoni transforms into a pepperoni pizza. Subverted with Brock Head, who transforms into a broccoli pizza.

    Video Games 

-   _Black Mesa_: Every pizza found throughout the game is pepperoni-flavored. The menus posted in the facility's various cafeterias also list cheese and tomato pizza, although it's nowhere to be seen.
-   Due to most of the _Five Nights at Freddy's_ games taking place at one of a line of children's pizzerias, we see a fair amount of pizza illustrations and occasional actual pizza. Most of the time, such as the pizza-themed wall hangings in the first game, they are, of course, pepperoni. However, the Bait-and-Switch intro of _Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator_ does allow you to add all sorts of toppings to your pizza, not just pepperoni. Additionally, the "Pizza Party" level of _Five Nights At Freddys VR Help Wanted_ has a segment where the game asks if the player would prefer cheese or pepperoni pizza. Which pizza appears at the end of the level depends on the player's choice. Not like you'd be able to enjoy it for too long, though.
-   _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_: Not only are all the pizzas CJ can get at Well-Stacked Pizza pepperoni, the restaurant's logo and radar icon depict a slice of pepperoni pizza. As with _Black Mesa_, looking at their menu reveals alternate toppings.

-   _Scribblenauts_: Just like all the food being depicted by its stock appearance, pizza is no exception. The pizza in the game contains red dots, with some smaller green dots visible as well.
-   _The Sims_: In most of the games, if a Sim orders a pizza, the pizza will appear to have pepperoni on it when it arrives. This is taken further by _The Sims 3_, where if a vegetarian Sim attempts to eat pizza, they'll become sick, presumably due to the pepperoni. This gets averted in _The Sims 4_, with the ability to order multiple types of pizza, which each have different appearances to reflect the toppings. Each game also provides an In-Universe example, as the delivery staff's uniform and/or pizza box will include a cartoonish graphic of a pizza including the traditional red spots.
-   In _Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening_, the pizza Dante has on his desk and attempts to eat when demons break into his office has very prominent pepperoni slices on it. Doubled down in his character profile, which states his favorite food is pizza and his favorite topping is pepperoni.

-   In _The Loud House_, whenever pizza is seen, it's always pepperoni.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic:_ The episode "Pinkie Pride" features a pizza topped with big, red tomato slices—so it looks at first glance like your standard pepperoni pizza, but still fits into the ponies' (mostly) vegetarian diet.
-   An interstitial on _The Pink Panther_ has Pink in his "Super Pink" outfit in flight delivering pizzas. The first order is to an ecologist in the Arctic Circle whose order—tomato with green peppers—arrives frozen solid. The second is to a shiek in the Gobi desert—it melts.
