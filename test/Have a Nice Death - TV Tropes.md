_"Congratulations on Your Recent Death! Thanks for playing Space Quest III. As usual, you've been a real hoot."_

In video games, it is common to have Everything Trying to Kill You. Some games try to vary the experience of dying over and over again by giving the player various mocking death messages, which can be one-liners or run through many screens.

Though the death message could just be randomly selected from a generic list, it often specifically relates to what killed you, thus overlapping with Non-Standard Game Over.

However, having a game do this creates a perverse incentive for the player to die in every way possible at least once to see the ending message. Contrast Player Death Is Dramatic.

**Common subjects for these messages to talk about include:**

-   Your possibly imbecilic adventuring skills that led you to such an untimely death. (Think the game's a bit too difficult? Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy.)
-   A witty remark on the means of your demise, in the style of a Bond One-Liner or a Quip to Black or "That's gotta hurt!"
-   The last inane thoughts running through your character's head.
-   A hint about what you could have done to avoid the death. (Common in multiplayer games and Visual Novels.)
-   A replay of the last few seconds before your death.
-   A "Kill Cam" that replays the first person view of the one who killed you.
-   The amusing posthumous legacy of your character, such as your body giving indigestion to a local monster.

See also Informal Eulogy, It's a Wonderful Failure, The Many Deaths of You, Empty Room Until the Trap. If the death is also the result of player stupidity, it's Yet Another Stupid Death. Can sometimes crossover into Nightmare Fuel.

Not to be confused with _Have a Nice Death (2022)_.

## Video Game Examples:

    Action Adventure 

-   _Brave Fencer Musashi_ always dies with some voiced thought. ("If I'm reincarnated, I wanna be Musashi again!") If you choose to continue, then everything beyond your last save was All Just a Dream.
-   In _Brütal Legend_, it is possible to get Eddy to say something as he dies in a normal mission. ("Hey, wanna make out before we hit the water?") However, the good ones come from the RTS missions (ex: "What were they thinking? Didn't they see the giant fists?") and the 'protect the bus' missions, (Ex: listening over your radio as Magnus gets burned alive or "All your friends were on that bus, weren't they?") which have entire cutscenes for them.
-   An old (and random) BASIC game called _CAMEL_ issued a randomly-selected message from the following list upon your death (unless you were caught and eaten by pygmies):
-   _Castlevania: Curse of Darkness_ has a bunch of these!
    -   Trevor: "Your evil power can't beat me!" Somehow he manages not to narm this.
    -   Later in the second battle: "So, this is the best the Devil Forgemaster can do?" Thanks, Trevor. Thanks.
    -   Isaac, second battle: "Atone in death, you damned traitor!"
    -   Dracula himself, of course: "You die at my hands. You should be honored." Followed by classic evil laughter.
    -   If Dracula's second form stomps you, expect _LOTS_ of evil laughter, which is almost more rage-inducing than an actual sentence.
-   Game overs in the _Fear Effect_ series were accompanied by gruesome cutscenes, sometimes annoyingly long. Being overrun and eaten by a swarm of rats, getting shot in the head, accidentally killing your partner, getting a dose of nerve gas, and many others are disturbingly well-documented on Youtube.
-   In _Grand Theft Auto: Vice City_, if Tommy Vercetti kills someone while wanted with more than 3 wanted stars, he will sometimes shout "Nice funeral, asshole!"
-   _Kingdom Hearts III_'s final scenario involves the bosses taunting Sora as they land the final blow. If the player chooses to retry the fight, they also have additional commentary at the beginning of the rematch.
    
    **Riku Replica:** You didn't get enough last time?
    
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_:
        
        -   Going three in-game days without using the Ocarina of Time to travel back to the Dawn of the First Day leads to the moon crashing into Termina, destroying the world and erasing all your progress. You also get a fun message from the Happy Mask Salesman:
        
        _You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
        
        -   The 3DS remaster adds some extra text before the message:
            
            _And so the angry moon fell from the sky, annihilating this world and its many inhabitants. All items and such gained these last three days are lost._
            
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_:
        -   Though certainly not as harsh as some of the other examples on here, if you die in wolf form, Midna appears beside your body and gives an irritated little sigh with the most "Oh no not _again_" gesture you ever saw.
        -   If Wolf Link falls into quicksand, Midna hops off his back, and watches him sink, looking at him as if thinking "Should I or should I not help him?" while Link slowly sinks.
    -   If Link is killed by a member of the Yiga Clan in _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_, a dialogue box from his murderer will appear right before the game over screen:
        
        _Beware, fool, the eye of the Yiga._
        
-   _Maabus_ has a particularly guilt-inducing one. After a shot of some glowing green explosions going off on the island, the admiral who gave you your mission briefing at the beginning comes on the screen and says "The robot has been destroyed. The island has been destroyed. Soon, the world as we know it. Excuse me, I'm leaving to be with my family." Yikes. Oh, and then there's a shot of those same green explosions going off all over the world, and then the credits roll. This happens for every death, which will happen frequently if you don't know what you're doing.
-   _Maziacs_ on ZX Spectrum. The game has a set of about six death messages for each cause of death; here are just a few:
    -   _On a diet?_ (Ran out of energy.)
    -   _A pity you can't eat Maziacs._ (Killed by one of the titular monsters.)
    -   _Maziacs have to eat as well._ (Another message received when killed by a Maziac.)
-   _NieR: Automata_ pokes some fun at the player for getting some of the joke endings earned for doing purposefully counter-intuitive actions, such as describing the YoRHa Commander's stern expression as she floats through space if you self-destruct on the Bunker, or declaring that 2B left to go fishing after running from the final boss of Route A.

    Action Games 

-   _Batman: Vengeance_ had a quick one-liner, based on which stage and which type of enemy you lost against. "Death is not a substitute for justice" is what you get if you don't rescue the Joker when he jumps off the blimp.
-   _Age of Conan_'s game over menu features such taunts as "Cimmerians should not die so easily" and "The maidens question your virility".
-   The _Batman: Arkham Series_ features a quick one-liner from your foes when Batman dies, ranging from amusing (just about anything from Joker and Harley Quinn), to a Continuity Nod (Bane's) to terrifying (Scarecrow and Killer Croc). And since you get around two different scenes for each villain, you may actually want to die on purpose multiple times just to see them all.
    
    **Joker**: I salute my fallen enemy! \*raspberries\* \*falls over\*
    
    -   When the player dies in the Joker Challenges of _Batman: Arkham Asylum_, you get one from either Aaron Cash or Batman himself.
    -   These continue in _Batman: Arkham City_. As in the previous game, a different villain taunts you depending on where you die. And, as in the previous game, the taunts range from funny to terrifying. They also update as the game goes on, so dying to the Joker's men after his death has Harley referencing your (supposed) role in it, and citing this as revenge. One of them also reveals that Hugo Strange is actually working for someone, and that someone is testing Batman.
    -   Continued further in _Batman: Arkham Origins_. Notably, every phase of the final boss, a younger Bane, has its own set of messages.
    -   And of course the finale, _Batman: Arkham Knight_, carries on the tradition. Uniquely, dying to a random unaligned Mook has a Mook deliver the line, as opposed to a proper super-villain. You may also get random ones from the Joker part of your subconscious, who panics when he realizes that you're dead, so he'll die too. Who taunts who if you die to the Militia changes as the game develops, the Arkham Knight at first, and following his defeat it'll be Deathstroke or Scarecrow. You may also receive post-death _encouragement_ from Alfred or Robin on rare occasion. The DLC adds a whole lot more depending on whose Arkham Episode you died on and furthermore, one post-death scene from the Season of Infamy-only Mr. Freeze has him outright vow to avenge your death.
-   _Berzerk_'s enemy robots taunt you with "Got the humanoid! Got the intruder!" every time you die.
-   _Bombergirl_ has its own fanservicey spin to this trope by having players being treated to seeing their chosen Bombergirl's clothes being blown up to pieces. Alternatively, if a player's Bombergirl is wearing a super-deformed chibi hair piece, it changes their character portraits into a chibi artstyle and players are greeted with a sillier artwork of their character being defeated instead.
-   The _Conan_ platform game on the Apple II had the unusual (in that genre) feature of displaying a completely different game over screen — with variable graphics and text — based on what particular hazard caused your final death. For example, dying on a field of spikes in the second screen would give "Mission Terminated" with an exaggerated picture of the same spikes; falling into lava gave "You beat a heated retreat"; and dying via killer ants gave "Death at thy feet, life from above.."
-   The FMV-filled version of _Demolition Man_ actually features original footage of Sylvester Stallone, who comes on whenever you lose and critiques your performance. He ends by actually saying "You Suck".
-   In _Die Hard Trilogy 2: Viva Las Vegas_, death results in a cutscene with a body bag and toe tag reading "John Doe (McClane)".
-   _Fear Effect_. Both games feature failure cutscenes where your character gets killed off in one form or another, followed by a Game Over screen.
-   In _Progressbar 95_, touching a red segment (or fulfilling other modes' failure conditions, like missing the ball in Progressball) will cause the game to visually and audibly glitch out, followed by a parody of the Windows "Blue Screen of Death" error message specific to the OS you're playing on.
-   Both _Return Fire_ games had a skull laughing at you in the (frequent) event of your death.
-   _Robot Unicorn Attack_ gives you different messages depending on how you died. Smash into a wall? "Your dreams did not come true." Crash into a star? "You became a star." Fall off the screen? "Your dreams were dashed against the rocks below."
-   _Star Wars: Rebel Assault_ does this a lot, e.g.: "The rookie wasn't that sharp after all" (if you die on the last training mission). "The Death Star continued to extinguish Rebel bases throughout the Galaxy... ...and the Alliance was defeated" (if you fail the final stage of the first game). "I got the Rebel dirtbag here" (if you die in the second mission of _Hidden Empire_). Notable in that there are unique animations for each stage if you lose all of your lives.
-   Several Jeff Minter games display (very brief) messages on death describing what killed the player. The release version of _Iridis Alpha_ would display "OVERLOAD", "DEPLETED.", "ENTROPY.", or "HIT SOMMAT" on the life loss screen, and _Tempest 2000_ would display "Caught you!", "Shot you!", or "Fried you!" at the moment of life loss. His later Tempest variants, _Tempest 3000_ and _Space Giraffe_, dropped this feature in favor of using differing sound effects to indicate what killed the player, but as this was not obvious, many players complained about not knowing what had killed them in those games.
-   Bosses in the _Zone of the Enders_ series give you a mocking (often hauntingly-unnerving) one-liner upon finishing you off.
    
    **Tyrant**: "You just about made it to bein' a hero. didn't ya kid?"
    
-   _Super Animal Royale_ randomly picks from a number of different messages when you die, each one containing some kind of animal wordplay.
    
    You dead. Must have been a cheetah.
    
    It's pandamonium! And you're out.
    
    Guess you're not the swan this time.
    
    That was unbearable to watch...
    
    You're dead. We're pawsitive.
    

    Adventure Games 

-   Sierra adventure games made an art out of mocking the player for death, with the classic "Restore/Restart/Quit" dialog box. The ways to die in the _Space Quest_ games have been catalogued on The Many Deaths of Roger Wilco.
-   Sierra's adventure games deserve a special mention for having some of the fastest ways to end your game for good in gaming history: For example, it's very possible to end _Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards_ in less than half a second by walking onto a street and getting run over by a car almost immediately afterwards.
    -   There's also the death for walking into a dark alley, which leads to a particularly Non-Standard Game Over that shows Larry's body lowered into an underground facility to be cloned for the player's next try (with cameos from several other Sierra games).
    -   Not to mention what happens if you don't pay for the taxi. Or run out of money. Or get into the taxi while holding alcohol. Or try to flush the toilet. Or don't use a condom with the hooker. Or forget to zip up after leaving the hooker.
    -   Another classic occurs when you do not beat the game within its (quite generous) time limit, where Larry considers his continued virginity so depressing that he kills himself.
    -   There's also a Gay Option in one game. Larry's not dead, but it's still Game Over. Looking at a woman's chest in the same game will also result in a game over.
    -   Spoofed in _The Secret of Monkey Island_:
        -   If you walk too near a cliff edge, Guybrush falls, you get a cheesy pop-up window that looks straight out of one of Sierra's "Quest" series, and then Guybrush bounces back up, where he offers two words of explanation: "Rubber tree!"
        -   Sierra has a Shout-Out to this in the puzzle game _Castle of Dr. Brain_. One of the hallways has a rubber tree with the description "These can be very useful should you fall off a high cliff. They are much less useful inside a castle." (It's a game in which you can't be killed, incidentally.)
    -   Another spoof, this time in _Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge_, has Guybrush telling the story to Elaine in which he fails to escape an acid trap in time and dies. This prompts her response, "Horse hockey. You honestly expect me to believe you were disintegrated in acid." The plot goes back to before the event.
        -   _Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time_ had a similar death message. The Prince-as-narrator says, "No, that didn't really happen" or similar.
        -   "And then, I died. No, wait."
        -   This also happens in _Kings Quest (2015)_ due to the game's framing device.
-   _Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist_: Take any medications meant for someone else, open the bag of horse farts, let the town be overrun by snails...
-   _Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame_: Lose to Jaffar in the final level, and he'll laugh at your loss.
-   _Bastion_ gave the narrator a large variety of different lines he could use upon your death, and one which he used if you fell off the first stage (which doesn't actually kill you in that game — it causes an instant respawn — but the player might not know that at the time.
-   _Beyond the Edge of Owlsgard_: Being inspired by classic Sierra games, the game provides a throwback to their Game Overs in the form of unique grim-yet-humorous death messages that appear whenever Finn meets an untimely end.
    
    The kid falls to his death... _(player respawns)_ ...just kidding.
    
-   In _Spider And Web_, for most of the game, the player character is trapped in a Virtual Reality machine, narrating their (already complete) infiltration of an enemy base to an unknown interrogator. If the player's actions result in death, the character is pulled out of the simulation, and the interrogator deadpans "And then you died."
-   In _Police Quest 1: In Pursuit of the Death Angel_, if you "drop gun" or "give gun", the message says "A police officer without a weapon is like being up a creek without a paddle!". Ironically, you don't actually _need_ your gun except during two scenes, and you can safely leave it in your locker _or in the jail locker_ for the rest of the game.
-   _King's Quest I: Quest For The Crown_:
    -   One early game death is the moat. If you walk too quickly or don't stay close enough to the castle, you can easily fall into the moat, and get told "The moat monsters appreciate your good taste."
    -   Get caught by the witch (either by not dodging her when she's on her broom or by walking into her house without protection) and you get a cutscene of her placing a cookie shaped like Graham in front of her house.
        
        "The witch turned you into a gingerbread man! Or is that a Graham cracker?"
        
-   On Sierra's _Gabriel Knight: The Sins of the Fathers_, if Gabe is killed, you are shown a skull while Gabriel's voice tells you, "I _really_ don't want to be dead. Can we try that again?". Tim Curry's delivery as the voice of Gabriel makes the scene.
-   _The Multi Dimensional Thief_ gives at least 13 ways to die. Each of them has a uniquely written death description, along with a rank giving a short summary of your new state.
-   You can die in _Quest for Glory I_ by _sticking your lockpick a bit too far up your nose_, which only occurs if you try to "pick nose" with a very low lockpicking skill. Genius. Twisted genius. Buy that writer twelve thousand beers. (Beer is fine, just don't drink the Dragon's Breath, or you will also die by bursting into flames.)
    -   "All unique Game Over messages" is a popular speedrun category for this game.
    -   _Quest For Glory V_ took this to the next level by providing poems mocking the player's death. There was a surprising variety of poems, each for a different type of death.
    -   "Here's a lesson you've been taught / Guybrush Threepwood, you are not..." Sierra decided to literally elevate their nice deaths to an art-form, then.
-   Getting yourself killed in _Zork: Grand Inquisitor_ gives you a text screen similar to the original _Zork_ games; a text command similar to what you just did to get yourself killed appears, followed by a text description of the result. Among the more colorful ways to die in the game are playing a losing "Old Scratch" lotto scratch ticket (the ticket is haunted and the devil steals your soul), falling down a bottomless pit (you meet another hapless person falling endlessly, start a family, and die of old age), and all manner of combinations involving the settings on a Totemizer and a dimensional portal at the end (in one, you're effectively turned into a hubcap and are discarded on the side of the Jersey Turnpike).
    -   The best was after losing a game of "Strip Fire-Water-Grue" while time traveling; you become one of the characters you meet at the beginning of the game. Ah, paradox…
    -   Its parody form on Uncyclopedia will give you Game Over screens involving everything up to and including _Mario_ imitations. Of course, the entire point of the Uncyclopedia version is to kill you as often as possible…
    -   Nearly all the totemizer destinations are fatal in their own way. You can also send yourself into the vacuum of space, or to New Jersey, where you die by living out a relatively mundane and uninteresting life. You also get different death messages depending on whether or not you turned off the device that permanently seals the totems. The only other nonfatal approach to the puzzle is to send yourself, unsealed, "Straight to Hell," which is another location in the game, complete with a handy subway platform. Of particular note is the Totemizer setting for "Mars". The area you are taken to is made up of real pictures of the Martian landscape where you die due to the lack of oxygen on Mars.
-   _Buried in Time: The Journeyman Project Part 2_ would switch over to a block of text explaining your various demises. During the endgame, if Gage does not set some teleport coordinates correctly, he will be sent into the lap of some visiting aliens who were waiting for their first experience with carry-out from an Earth restaurant. They enjoy the "crunchy on the outside, chewy in the inside" texture of Gage inside his timesuit.
    -   The first _Journeyman Project_ game had each different death depicted with a rather graphic picture and a text box describing the death, sometimes mocking the player. Some particularly gruesome examples: getting run over by the maintenance transport on Mars, dying from prolonged exposure to radiation in the Sauna of Death Shield Generator Room, or getting crushed by the ore processor. Many of these were "learn by dying" situations, and unavoidable the first time through.
    -   Not all of these are deaths, though. For example, in Chichen-Itza, if the player chooses to walk down the steps towards the natives, the game cuts to the "Game Over" screen, describing how you showing up in a big metal suit has caused them to assume you're a god and build a statue in your honor, thus having a major effect on history.
-   In the _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ Licensed Game, any of the myriad ways to die would produce a game over screen with the question "Start again (y/n)?" Answering positively would yield "From the same point (y/n)?" Agreeing to this would lead to the game starting again _from the exact same time you died_. Game over. The correct course of action was, of course, to reject starting again from the same point and acknowledging that you wanted to start again "from not quite the same point". The game over screen was accompanied by mocking voiceovers from Eric Idle. "You're dead, and I'm alive!"
-   _Peasant's Quest_ had this, with a twist — not only are your normal death messages like this, but so is your Plotline Death at the end.
-   Dying to a Guitar Warrior in _Total Distortion_ gives you what's been described as the "Best Game Over Ever": **DEATH BY GUITAR WARRIOR**! Sing along with me!: "You are Dead! Dead! Deeead! You are Dead! Dead! Deeead!". Different death messages are used for burning to death, being trapped by the Deadly Video, or simply running out of health outside of combat (which is generally more common); these have much simpler and more abstract animations, but use the same song.
-   When you die in _Shadow of Destiny_, you are given what is intended as a hint before you replay the level, but in practice, said hints tend to be either mocking you or terribly unhelpful. Examples include, "It looks like there's someone hiding behind a tree, and that someone is out to get you. How do you suppose you can prevent that?" "Did you really think a rotten rope would hold your weight?" and after returning to the present day and being immediately killed, "I don't think returning to the present is the way to solve this problem." Of course, there's a pretty good chance that the person making said comments is probably Homunculus. And considering his general disposition, said comments are rather fitting.
-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1984)_ was an early forerunner in this field. There were many, many ways that the hapless main character could receive a sarcastic and often ironic death message. One particular death (being hit with a brick while protesting against the bulldozer) forced the player to read a multi-sectioned text on their death, having to type to read the next section. Typing quit to start over would not quit; it would rather be interpreted as typing something to continue. And to add insult to injury, the game would scold you for it — "You keep out of this, you're dead." This was annoying especially because it was one of the easiest ways to die early in the game.
-   Die in the Tex Murphy game _Under A Killing Moon_, and you get a conversation with "The Great P.I. in the Sky," (i.e. God, played by James Earl Jones), who gives you advice. He also lets you return to just before the moment of death to try again, implying that Tex is so important to history that God is willing to give him a second chance. Tex _is_ that important to history. His seemingly small cases unravel into world-spanning conspiracies.
-   In _Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis_, Game Over screens will usually be accompanied by a text explaining Dr. Jones' death and/or what happened after. A paraphrased example: "The Nazi forces conquered the world due to Indy's inability to defeat a 70 year-old sea captain."
-   Any game by Horrorsoft (now Adventuresoft): _Elvira_ 1 or 2, or _Waxworks (1992)_ (ESPECIALLY _Waxworks_). Getting killed by any enemy or trap will show you the very gruesome results of your failure. Most of them not very pretty.
-   The little-known Sega CD point and click adaptation of _Jurassic Park_ cleverly featured a black screen with only the sounds of the player character's demise, usually at the claws and teeth of the various dinosaurs found around the island. For mere audio, it could get quite gory indeed.
-   When you in _Return to Zork_, the screen fades to black, someone (Morpheus) laughs at you, and you get a screen at a temple with the glass window showing a picture of your death and a short message at the bottom of the screen.
    -   There are also a number of pieces of music that plays in the temple screen, different for multiple types of death. Most notably, dying to the giant spider in the forest plays a minor-key arrangement of Faure's Pavane, which is never heard anywhere else in the game; if you're playing the CD version, it's played by recorded strings and timpani!
    -   Some of the deaths are quick and don't result in a laugh; an example is deaths from explosions.
-   _King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride_ involves the main character's talking head next to the message "You Have Expired. Do you want to try again?" The character usually summarizes what she (meaning you) should have done. Stuff like taking too long causes your character to say she should have been more decisive, and doing an action that kills you causes the character to say "Maybe I shouldn't do that next time..." Of course, doing something insanely stupid (walking into an open grave and so forth) makes the character say something alone the lines of "What was I thinking?!?" However, drinking a pot full of saltwater that behaves like cyanide (or perhaps more like a _sniper shot_) never gets old.
-   All too common with _Nancy Drew_ games. Usually, she either had a "Whoops don't do that!" message or a telephone conversation with someone saying she got fired or sent home. From _The Phantom of Venice_ through _The Deadly Device_, you get a humorous Good News, Bad News screen.
    -   One example, after falling out of a tree in _Warnings at Waverly Academy_:
        
        **The Good News:** No one saw you fall out of the tree.  
        **The Bad News:** At least not until the surveillance video was posted online. Three million hits? Oh no!
        
    -   Get caught snooping in Fango's office in _The Phantom of Venice_ and this message might happen:
        
        **The Good News:** The GdiF put up your bail.  
        **The Bad News:** You have to be smuggled out of the country dressed as a goat herder. Baahhh!
        
    -   Blowing up the jetpack in _The Haunting of Castle Malloy_:
        
        **The Good News:** Watching the jetpack blow up was actually kind of fun...  
        **The Bad News:** ...for exactly one one thousandth of a second. After that? Not so much.
        
    -   One death sequence is when you fall by clicking on the wrong floor tiles in _Tomb of the Lost Queen_:
        
        "To spruce up your hallways, consider rigging stones to drop suddenly. The danger of guests plummeting to their untimely deaths is sure to spice up even the dullest dinner party." An excerpt from Better Tombs and Gardens, issue 2000 circa 2000 B.C.E.
        
    -   In a few of them, it ends with your pathetic come-take-me-home message to Hannah. One version of this has you mix up words as you speak if you got a Game Over from a concussion.
-   _Conquests of the Longbow_, a Sierra game based on Robin Hood, had the twist of showing the Merry Men discussing the manner of Robin's death, usually including a hint on how to avoid repeating the same mistake.
-   _Shadowgate_. Each death was accompanied with a lovingly detailed description of your end (some of which could get quite gruesome, like being impaled on glass or dissolving in acid.) And this was during the early Nintendo era, when most of the audience of this game were little kids! The creepy music and Grim Reaper face that accompanied every death only added to the Nightmare Fuel.
-   _Uninvited_ does this with a blood-red skull and/or a horrifying close-up of whatever was killing you to accompany the description of your horrible death.
-   _Luigi's Mansion_: "Goodnight!!!" Done again in _Dark Moon_. The third game takes it up a notch by having King Boo serve as a Game-Over Man.
-   _Ace Attorney_: Most failures just result in a Guilty verdict on your client, but failing in the final case of "Justice for All" results in Phoenix quitting as a lawyer, along with the uplifting message: "The miracle never happen."
-   _Night Trap_ will either you get berated by Simms for screwing up and kicked off the mission, or later in the game, when the SCAT moves in and you fail, Jeff personally tells you how much you messed up before sending you down one of the traps.
-   _A Tale of Two Kingdoms_, as a tribute to Sierra's game over screens, shows you a tombstone with a poem on it that tells you how you died. The poem is different for each death.
-   _Bik_ is a throwback to the old point-and-click adventures. Naturally, this trope is in effect. In fact, the game gives you achievements for dying in creative ways. For example, when controlling Bik on the final level, clicking on one of the tables in the robot room results in Bik undergoing Unwilling Roboticisation with the message that he spends the rest of his days as a mindless servant. The game awards you with the "More Machine than Man" achievement. A good indicator that your current Player Character (Bik, Ammut, Talandra) is about to be killed is the game autosaving to provide you with a way to continue. One particularly long example involves having Ammut pick up a huge gun called LFG 9000, whose description claims that it's banned on most worlds. Ammut immediately tries to use it to kill the huge creature trying to eat him. The weapon discharges, destroying the ship, with the blast continuing through space and destroying planets in its path, including Earth. Finally, a message tells you that there is a reason the weapon is banned.
-   The main appeal of the _Henry Stickmin Series_ is seeing how many hilarious and creative ways the Butt-Monkey protagonist can die or otherwise fail his mission, with every failure causing a sassy remark on the FAIL screen. Most games even give you an achievement for seeing all unique fails, thus creating even more incentive to pick the most ill-thought-out options for Henry.
-   Robert Carr's _Mormonoids from the Deep_, a Macintosh game using the World Builder engine, has "Welcome to Mormonville, Citizen!" as its standard Game Over message, as well as a few Non-Standard Game Over screens, one of which plays a clip of "Game over, man!" from _Aliens_.
-   _Heroine's Quest_, being a Spiritual Successor, naturally also does this. One of the more notable ones is that you can die from playing Tetris too much: the world ends since you were too busy playing to save it.
-   _In A Manor Of Speaking_, taking place in a World of Pun, has various silly ways for you to die. When you do, there's always a pun to accompany the way you died. For instance, if you have some drawings become real and they end up attacking others, you get sentenced to jail to "live life on a lamb": "Looks like the writing is on the wall for you!" Eating an apple off the floor results in "What a rotten way to die!", and if you don't duck in time to avoid something hurtling towards you, it says "You didn't duck and now your goose is cooked!"

    Beat 'em Up 

-   _Dynamite Cop_ has all of the mooks and boss mocking you while you're lying on the floor, most often calling you a loser or a poor baby. If you have any continues left, when you hit start, you jump up and sucker punch the nearest foe.
-   The arcade version of _The Combatribes_ barks "You coward! Get out! Game Over" if you choose not to continue.
-   _Final Fight_ features the heroes in the villains' lair, tied up, in a Death Trap. Why Don't You Just Shoot Him? If you continue before the clock runs out, a knife comes down to cut the fuse and your bonds, allowing you to escape.

    Card Battle Games 

-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! Nightmare Troubadour_, losing a Shadow Game boss fight results in a quote from the duelist who defeated you.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX: Spirit Caller_: If you lose in a Shadow Game, your opponent will say a menacing quip at you.

    Driving Games 

-   While driving or falling into the river (or the ocean) in _Midtown Madness_, will appears at the screen a message: "Sleep with the fishes!". Also, it does the same thing in the sequel, only in San Francisco; while in London, it shows to the player: "More tea, vicar?".
-   The console releases of the _Crazy Taxi_ series have minigames where you need to fulfill certain objectives. In these minigames, failing an objective yields a message from the announcer. Survive, but fail? "Uh-oh, too bad!" Fall into the water? "No time to take a bath!" Fall hundreds of meters to your doom? "Hey! Where ya goin'?"
-   Whilst not exactly a 'death' (even if you crash into a wall at over _230 mph_), failing a licence test in _Gran Turismo 4_ awards you with a large white **FAIL** on the screen, and the song "Oh Yeah" by Yello. The game _gloats_ through music over your failure.
-   _FAST Racing NEO_ and its Updated Re-release _FAST RMX_ have "PLEASE TRY AGAIN!" when failing to beat a record in Time Attack mode or being eliminated in Hero Mode. If the announcer sounds familiar, he should; it's Jack Merluzzi, who also provided the announcer voice in _F-Zero GX_.
-   In _Vette!_, crashing out (either by too much damage or a high-speed collision) gives you a nice picture of your smashed car. Driving into water results in it being fished out by a tow truck. If you lose a race, your opponent mocks you, such as "I thought you said you were fast".
-   _Road Rash_ has post-race cutscenes that show your triumphs and, if you get busted or wreck your bike, your failures. From _II_, you can be shown:
    -   When busted: getting stuffed into the trunk of a police car, trying to escape while the arresting officer appears to be Distracted by the Sexy (and failing), chucked into the back of a paddy wagon, having the paddy wagon drive off before you can be chucked into it and subsequently landing on the pavement, and trying to escape by driving the paddy wagon yourself only to be thwarted by another patrol car
    -   When wrecked: watching helplessly as paramedics take your bike and leave you behind, stumbling into the road and getting hit by a semi truck, falling out of the ambulance as it drives off, failing to hitch a ride on a pickup truck carrying hay, and trying to ride your bike only for it to fall apart
-   _Sega Rally_: "GAME OVER YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!"
-   In _DiRT 2_, the first time you total your car, someone says "I can see that crash being posted on the internet."
-   _Interstate76_ had a lot of random, typically sarcastic, messages mocking you for dying or failing a mission, such as "Welcome to Deadville, population: _You_" or "You just lost a race to a clown. Time to retire."
-   Most _Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune_ games "award" a Story Mode Broken Win/Loss Streak of 40 stages (out of 60, 80, or 100, depending on the game) or more with the "First Black Mark" title.
-   _OmniBus (2016)_ randomly selects a different message every time you fly off the map. "SEE YA BUDDY", "ADIOS AUTOBUS", "GOOD TRY", etc. If you flip over and can't right yourself, the game doesn't even bother with a message, instead just popping up the prompt to restart or quit.
-   In the DOS Game _Stunt Driver_, crashing out of a race shows you an instant replay of your wipeout. If you drive into water, a shark is waiting for you along with the message "Hope you can swim."

    Edutainment Games 

-   Famously, _The Oregon Trail_ featured a lot of dying: You get a nice tombstone when you inevitably die of snakebite, drowning, measles, and (of course) dysentery. If you get mauled while hunting in the fifth edition, you may catch rabies, which of course is certain death.
-   _Odell Lake_ has "You now reside in the stomach of a large predator" or "Oh no! You have just been eaten!" if you underestimated a predator or mistook it for food/competition/no problem, and "There was an angler's hook hidden in that food." or "You have been caught by an angler!" if the insects & larvae or the chub you ate was bait and your fish is now being served with chips. The _Commodore 64_ version instead uses generic messages, just saying whom eats your fish. In _Odell Down Under_, the game will also mock you if you manage to accidentally get caught in a giant clam.

    Fighting Games 

-   _Mortal Kombat_:
    -   In _Mortal Kombat 3_, if you(r character) lose(s) to the Optional Boss Noob Saibot (which you most likely will), Shao Kahn says "It's official. You Suck".
    -   If Shao Kahn kills you with a Brutality in _Mortal Kombat 11_, he also says "It's official: you suck!" as he enters a victory pose.
-   Getting a bad ending in _BlazBlue: Continuum Shift_ will send you to Kokonoe's lab, where she gives your character sarcastic advice on how to achieve the good ending. Since most of the bad endings feature your character dying, this tends to lead to Mood Whiplash. The Big Bad Duumvirate's hobby seems to be causing this. If you lose a match to Hazama in Arcade, you have to fight him again. If you win, it turns out you still lose. Run into Relius in Story Mode? 75% chance he'll be the cause of the Bad Ending.
-   _Street Fighter II_ started the tradition of fighting games displaying a different line on the Continue/Game Over screen depending on the character that defeated you.
-   The plot of _The Outfoxies_ revolves around assassins being paid to kill each other off. Predictably, losing results in a little cutscene of your victorious opponent marking you off.
-   In _Marvel vs. Capcom 3_, Galactus is the Final Boss. Fail to beat him? Well, enjoy watching the worlds of Marvel _and_ Capcom getting destroyed! And in the Ultimate follow-up, Ghost Rider uses this exact phrase after subjecting his opponent to the Penance Stare.
-   In _The King of Fighters 2000_, each character had a defeat quote to say at the continue screen.
-   In the _Arcana Heart_ series, whichever character you've chosen will either express disappointment, give you a tip, chastise you for losing, or beg for you to continue on the Continue screen. Continuing will express a smile of relief on your character.
-   In _Zero Divide_ if you quit. You will be relentlessly mocked by the announcer, "I can't believe you're giving up so soon! You're such a baby. Go home to your mama!"

    First-Person Shooters 

-   Most of the time, _AMID EVIL_ will just give you a standard “You died” message if you die. However, in specific circumstances, there will be a special tag on it (seen in this video):
    -   “Cooked!” for dying to fire damage
    -   “Sliced!” if you get chopped in half
    -   “Squashed!” if you get crushed
    -   “Melted!” if you die by acid attacks or certain boss character spells
    -   “Splat!” if you fall down a Bottomless Pit
    -   “Kaboom!” if you get blown up
    -   “Obliterated!” if you get sucked into one of your own black holes from a powered up Aeturnum. It seems you can get this message from falling out of the final boss level and into his galactic pool, too.
    -   The prequel, _The Black Labyrinth,_ adds “Impaled” for when you die to spikes.
-   For an old, vintage (1994) FPS, _Battle Corps_ have a really terrible "Game Over" message from your commander that rubs your failure in:
    
    You _really_ fragged it, sweetheart. I should've sent in a battalion of girl-guides - they'd have done better than you...
    
-   In the demo of _Duke Nukem Forever_, dying by falling off of a cliff produces this message while the game reloads to your last save point: "If you died from falling off a high ledge, it's probably your own fault."
-   When you die around rebels in _Half-Life 2_, some will say things like "He's done this before. He'll be okay.", or "Dibs on the suit!".
    -   Also, in _Half-Life 2_, if you get a game over by losing a vehicle or key ally, you will get a fade-to-black followed by a mission report from the G-Man, saying something like: "Subject: Freeman. Mission terminated. Reason: Failure to conserve vital resources." In the Episodes, you instead get a prophecy of doom from the Vortigaunts, after they wrest control of you from the G-Man.
    -   If you died in a way that couldn't possibly be accidental, the message changes to "Mission terminated: Subject demonstrated extremely poor judgment".
    -   Further, in the _Opposing Force_ expansion of the first game, you get an opportunity to jump into Freeman's portal to Xen. If you do, the game will end, accusing you of trying to rewrite history — "Evaluation terminated: Subject attempted to create a Temporal Paradox.".
-   Reed Wahl, the antagonist of the _Minerva's Den_ DLC for _BioShock 2_ who's in control of a supercomputer called The Thinker, taunts you over the radio if you die.
    
    "Boom! Right on schedule."
    
    "Hah! The Thinker told me you were a clumsy one."
    
    "You're running behind The Thinker's calculations! Try and keep up!"
    
-   Bungie's old game _Pathways into Darkness_ gives you a different dialog box for everything that can kill you. Those Banshees are really annoying, aren't they?
-   _Quake_ had a different death message for being killed by each monster. It also featured a colourful list of messages for suicides, environmental deaths, and the multiplayer kill messages are loaded with double entendres.
    -   Complete list of environmental deaths, suicides, and multiplayer messages (taken from the game's data files, such as the official Github):
        
        "Weenie sleeps with the fishes" and "Weenie sucks it down" (drowning)  
        "Weenie gulped a load of slime" and "Weenie cannot exist on slime alone" (fell in a slime pit)  
        "Weenie burst into flames", "Weenie turned into hot slag", and "Weenie visits the Volcano God" (fell into lava)  
        "Weenie discharges into the water" (fired the lightning gun underwater; versions of the message also exist for slime and lava)  
        "Weenie tries to put the pin back in" (died to own grenade)  
        "Weenie becomes bored with life" and "Weenie checks if his weapon is loaded" (suicide by being too close (whether intentional or not) to your rocket explosions)  
        "Fraggod was telefragged by Weenie" or "Weenie tried to enter Fraggod's personal space" (Tele-Frag)  
        "Weenie feels Satan's power" (attempted telefrag, "victim" had Pentagram of Protection)  
        "Weenie was ax-murdered by Fraggod" (axe)  
        "Weenie chewed on Fraggod's boomstick" (shotgun)  
        "Weenie ate 2 loads of Fraggod's buckshot" (super shotgun)  
        "Weenie was nailed by Fraggod" (nailgun)  
        "Weenie was punctured by Fraggod" (super nailgun)  
        "Weenie eats Fraggod's pineapple" and "Weenie was gibbed by Fraggod's grenade" (grenade launcher)  
        "Weenie rides Fraggod's rocket" (rocket launcher)  
        "Fraggod accepts Weenie's discharge" and "Weenie accepts Fraggod's shaft" (lightning gun)
        
    -   The only interesting monster death message is "Player joins the Zombies" (killed by a zombie). The rest are pretty matter-of-fact statements in the "Player was <verb>ed by a <noun>" pattern.
-   _Unreal Tournament_ had a different kill message for each weapon, and, being a multiplayer game, you would often see messages like "<Rival> rode <Player>'s rocket into oblivion." The sequels expanded these kill messages into even more colorful ones, rarely related to what weapon got used, such as, "<Rival> was cornered by <Player> in a foggy London alley." In fact, one of the major selling points of the game was that it recorded an insane amount of data on player kills, and always told you what they were.
    -   _Unreal Tournament 2004_:
        -   Dying from your own land mines reads: "<Player> tested out his/her land mine. It works!", and getting killed by your own grenade goes something along the lines of "Silly <Player>, Grenades are for Enemies!"
        -   If someone somehow manages to do a headshot with the Lightning Gun to _himself_, the game will proclaim that "<Player> violated the laws of space-time and sniped himself."
    -   The series also includes notices telling you of when another player gets a Kill Streak to let you know that they're doing good. Killing someone who's in the midst of a streak places a similar notice letting everyone know that you did so. Kill _yourself_ in the midst of a streak and the game will inform everyone "<Player> was looking good until s/he killed him/herself!"
-   The _Call of Duty_ series' death screens display randomly selected quotes about war. In later games, it shows helpful advice on how to avoid what you've just died from (if you died from something easily avoidable, such as a grenade or highly combustible and exploding car), or statistics such as the price of a single missile or fighter jet in _Modern Warfare_. Multiplayer matches have a "Killcam" showing a replay from the first person of the one who killed you.
-   The tactical FPS _Operation Flashpoint_ has this. When you're killed, the camera pans back and forth between your lifeless corpse and whoever killed you, while the game matter-of-factly states **"You are dead."** in bold red text, accompanied by quotes from authors, Cold War-era politicians, and even _Pink Floyd_ lyrics. In single player, that is. When you die in multiplayer matches, you become a spectator _in the form of a seagull_, and can fly around observing the action.
-   _Rise of the Triad._ Although not cruel to the player on the actual game over screen beyond showing severed, burning feet, the track title for the song that occurs upon a game over is nonetheless titled, "You suck", accompanied with a soundbite saying it word-for-word. Some deaths in the game result in an Orbital Shot before the character spontaneously gibs, may show the player burn, and in some suicides, causes the "Yooouuuuu Suuuuck!" announcement.
-   _Team Fortress 2_ has a simple format for reporting kills: <user name in respective color> <method of death> <enemy name>, where the method of death is a little pictogram of what killed you (a baseball bat, rocket, flamethrower, etc.). When you are killed via a backstab or a headshot, it shows a little silhouette with either a knife plunging into its back or a bullet exiting its head from the other side, respectively.
    -   About the only time a snarky remark is made is when you die from fall damage (<user> fell to a clumsy, painful death) or when you switch class outside of your base, which kills you (<user> bid farewell, cruel world!).
    -   The game's killcam shows you who it was that ended your pathetic run — and if it so happens that your body or body _parts_ are in view of the killcam, the game cheerfully points them out with arrows and signs... "Your leg!", "Your head!", "Your liver!" "Your other foot!"
        -   After being killed by the same player three times, they start spouting "domination phrases", which vary based on the class they are, and the class they killed. For example, when a Scout dominates a Heavy, one of the phrases he spouts is "Nice hustle, Tons o' Fun! Next time eat a salad!" Break the kill streak and the formerly-dominated gets to deliver a "revenge phrase." Say the Heavy gets Revenge on the Scout; he may say, "Next time, pick on someone your own tiny-baby size!"
        -   Additionally, there are server mods to display kill notifications in the style of _Unreal Tournament_ and _Quake_ (from which _Team Fortress_ descended); in one example, Player X backstabbing Player Z will display as "Player Z took a knife up the ass from Player X!"
    -   Some weapons actually use the kill feed as a selling point. For example, the Holy Mackerel (literally a fish) sends feeds every time an enemy is _hit_ with one. Pull off a kill and the kill feed exclaims "FISH KILL!!!" to emphasize the embarrassment. And there's a dismembered enemy arm that does the same thing except the kill feed goes "ARM KILL!!!"
-   An accidental example exists in _Counter-Strike_. When you are killed, a message shows in the upper, right-hand corner of the screen showing the killer's name, an icon of the weapon they used (with an additional icon of a head taking a bullet through the forehead if the kill was made via headshot), and then the victim's name. The flashbang does approximately one hit-point of damage (or less), and if you are killed by one, the icon in the message is reasonably larger than any other weapon icon, as if it was to mock the victim. Truthfully, because the flashbang was never meant to actually _kill_ anyone, the people who made the game never actually made a smaller icon for the kill messages.
    -   _Half-Life: Counter-Strike_ also had server side mods that played _Unreal_'s "HEADSHOT!!!" when taking a shot to the head, or _Quake_'s "HUMMILIATION!" when killed with a knife.
    -   _Global Offensive_ took the killcam approach.
-   _Descent_: "Ship Destroyed, X Hostages Lost!" "You died in the mine. Your ship and its contents were incinerated", if you die or run out of time after destroying the Reactor Boss.
-   _Doom_ source port _ZDoom_ (and others descended from it, like _Skulltag_) introduces _Quake_\-style one-liners for each kind of death.
    -   Most of them are ripped directly from _Quake_; Game Mods can have custom obituaries. "Creeper was patient enough to kill Puny Human with his balls."\]\]
    -   In _Doom (2016)_, the camera will show you, through the character's eyes, how the demon killed you (be it by ripping your arms and hitting you with it, or a magnificent view of your belly with a lot of it's normal content missing)
    -   Waiting long enough after a death in _Doom 64_ will have the hud print a random snarky message.
        
        **"LOOK AT ALL THOSE DEMON FEET!"**  
        **"YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT."**
        
-   _Faceball 2000_ for the Game Boy was a proto-First-Person Shooter, in which all the enemies (and other players) were some variety of smiley face. When you were taken out, the offending party would appear on screen, and it would say "(One who killed you) says, 'Have a nice day!'" This could maddening, but the Super Nintendo version of the same game made it worse by giving them synthesized voices (all of which simply said "Have a nice day!" in different pitches). In later levels, this could include being hunted by a pack of enemies and hearing "Have a nice day!" repeated every 15-30 seconds, depending on how long it took for them to home in on the next spawn point.
-   _Tribes 2_ had a message for every weapon kill. Most notably, a disk kill would give "<Killer> served <victim> a blue plate special." In _Tribes: Ascend_, that became the official name for a mid-air disk kill.
-   The New-U stations in _Borderlands_ makes player death little more than a financial inconvenience, and the instant respawns eliminate the need for a game over screen. However, the stations in _Borderlands 2_ have some rather amusing automated quips once they're done building your clone.
    
    Between you and us, that thing that just killed you is a total dick. Please disregard this message if you committed suicide.
    
    -   Of course, Dummied Out dialogue may occasionally have Handsome Jack mocking you for your failure before stripping you of your funds. And even if you are bankrupt, he still lets you be revived so he can watch you suffer.
    -   All of the enemies will mock you after you die before you respawn.
    -   In _Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!_, where it turns out that Hyperion's New-U Stations were initially operated by Dahl, the messages are instead military-themed:
    
    DYING ON DUTY IS A TREASONOUS OFFENSE, PUNISHABLE WITH DEATH!
    
-   _Urban Chaos: Riot Response_ has different death scenes depending on what enemy type kills you or who you were siding with before your demise. Enemies taunt you and then proceed to finish you off, while teammates hurriedly check on you and then proceed to call out for help or try to revive you.

    Flight Simulator 

-   The first three games in the _Wing Commander_ series feature an elaborate funeral scene for your character after you die in which your commanding officer gives a speech. The speech can often vary depending on the progress of the player in the game. For example, if you die early on in the first WC game, your CO will mourn you as a rookie who never got a chance to prove himself. If you die late in the game, he will mourn you as one of the Confederacy's greatest heroes.
-   In _Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom_, your death will just result in the game playing a news broadcast announcing that Blair has been killed. The content of the broadcast will depend on if Blair died before or after he joined the Border Worlds.
-   _Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer_ had a unique scene if you crash your plane. You get to see the face of Chuck Yeager giving a snarky comment.
-   _Pilotwings_ had various mocking comments by the trainers if you failed an event, such as "That's a parachute, not scuba gear" (parachute into water). "SPLAT!" (freefall without a parachute). "Be careful, the equipment is expensive" (crash the Rocketbelt). Rather disturbingly, failing the final helicopter mission instantly cuts to the game over scene.
-   _Combat Flight Simulator_ matter-of-factly states, "We regret to inform you that you have been killed in action. Your next of kin will be notified."
-   _Lunar Lander_:
    -   The game had several randomly chosen death messages. "You destroyed an 800 megabuck lander", "You created a two mile crater", "There were no survivors", etc.
    -   The Windows 3.1 _Lander_ game had two: "Nice crater! All that training really paid off." and "You just dug a hole half way to Clavius."
-   In the early Sierra game _Stunt Flyer_, crashing your plane in-game would actually cause your computer to crash.
-   In _Star Wars: TIE Fighter_ and _X-Wing_, getting shot down in the middle of a mission will result in a cutscene. The cutscene can vary based on presence of certain enemy ships, and whether or not your auto-eject system got disabled, both of which take the pilot out of commission.
    -   In _X-Wing_, the player will be reclaimed by a shuttle and then be shown floating in a medical tank (similar to Luke's from _The Empire Strikes Back_), or will be taken to Darth Vader's flagship and interrogated by Vader as an interrogation droid floats down. They may also be shown their funeral, with the coffin falling into a planet and burning in atmospheric re-entry.
    -   In _TIE Fighter_, the player will be shown being flown to a Star Destroyer and then be shown floating in a medical bay. If captured, they may also be ordered into a prison building, or killed pilots receive their funeral with the coffin being vaporized.

    4X 

-   An unusual strategy game example: If you lose in _Master of Orion 2_, the game informs you: "Your power is gone, fleet destroyed, armies scattered, cities crushed, people enslaved... your insolence has cost you your empire!" And then it laughs at you.
-   _Galactic Civilizations 2_ has distinct game over messages for military, influence, retirement, and technology losses, plus a special<small>◊</small> Non-Standard Game Over for anyone who blasts _their own capital_ into shrapnel with a Terror Star.

    Light Gun Games 

-   _Silent Scope_: "Don't die partner! Oh no! What are you doing? Stand up! Stand up!"
-   American Laser Games had a tonne of these. If you were shot, or killed an innocent bystander, you would typically be treated to a brief cutscene in which a particular character taunted you for your lousy gameplay:
    -   _Mad Dog McCree_: An undertaker who would comment on your actions and, if you were shot when you had three lives remaining (If you had more than three lives remaining, assuming you set the number of lives to 5 on the machine, the undertaker would say that you took a bad hit, but you will pull through), remind you how many lives you had left. When you ran out of lives, he would seal up your coffin. There are also scenes where, if you shoot the lady in the bank or any other innocents by mistake, he will say "That was a good man/woman you shot." Then, he writes down on his notepad and says that the population is now sixty-\*four\*. Or he might say "You need to learn the difference between the good guys and the bad guys!" then point at a grave and say, "This was a good guy!"
    -   _Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold_: An undertaker in a graveyard, with a small range of macabre quips. Run out of lives, and "you're history, partner."
    -   _Who Shot Johnny Rock?_: If you were shot, a doctor, who'd make various wisecracks at your expense whilst removing the bullet. When you were out of money, the doctor would refuse to help, and you'd get an additional scene with an undertaker commenting on your Game Over. They include the undertaker commenting how you would make a good stiff, <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> wishing you better luck next time, <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and commenting on your lack of money.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  If you gunned down an innocent bystander, said undertaker would appear to criticise your bad judgement.
    -   _The Last Bounty Hunter_: A disgruntled doctor or a wise-cracking gravedigger. If you shoot an innocent, instead of the doctor or the gravedigger, several other townspeople (even if some of their appearances are for a brief second at one point) will call you out for doing so.
    -   _Crime Patrol_: The police members that you are working with comment on your death, or, if you shot someone by mistake (even a team member), call you out on it, especially if you shoot your rookie partner during the rookie segments, where she will be unharmed and call you out for shooting her. As the game progresses, the post-death screens involve team members, and even getting up to the point where a female news reporter gets involved in the post-death screens.
-   The Light Gun Game _Area 51_ has a Game Over screen where, should you refuse to continue after you die, your character turns into an alien and jumps toward the screen. Oddly enough, you also get this after **you beat the game.**

    MOBA 

-   _League of Legends_ displays a damage breakdown dialog when you die, specifying how much damage from which skills did you take from who and how much was physical, magical or true damage.
-   _Dota 2_ plays a death quote from the enemy hero that killed you.

    MMORPGs 

-   The _World of Warcraft_ add-on "Cartographer" has the option to turn on insulting messages directing you to your corpse.
    -   Blizzard themselves have given us Zaricotl, an elite carrion bird in Badlands. Whenever it kills a player, it will eat their remains and calm down. Congratulations, your death has just made the area a bit safer for other players! Adding assault to injury, Zaricotl is ludicrously overpowered for the zone in which he is, and he also patrols, which means that he likes to gank unsuspecting newbies, a lot. He's a rare spawn, so generally, if you deliberately try to hunt him down, you won't find him. He will be there to eat your newbie character, though.
    -   Dungeon bosses also yell if they manage to kill a player in the group, usually commenting on how the player is weak and they're getting bored.
        -   By far the most entertaining example of this is Kologarn in the Ulduar raid, who also has a tendency to throw out Monty Python quotes.
            
            **Kologarn:** YOU FAIL!
            
        -   Also,
        -   The one and only Bloodlord Mandokir. In his original incarnation he didn't just taunt you for dying, oh no, he **leveled** off of your sorry ass: complete with shouting "DIIING!!!" and Jin'do the Hexxer (another boss in the raid) actually yells "Grats!" as if he were a player.
    -   Since Cataclysm, the dragon Deathwing has roamed free, randomly incinerating entire sections of the game world. Getting caught in this awards an achievement.
    -   Since TBC there has been an achievement for getting killed by the black dragon welps in Blackwing Lair. Inspired, of course, by the famous internet meme of Leroy Jenkins rushing headlong into this room and getting killed instantaneously. The achievement's name is Leeerooooy!... and the title it awards you with is "<your name> Jenkins".
    -   The airborne clash with Ley-Guardian Eregos gives us this awesomely sarcastic remark should a player be killed:
        
        **Ley-Guardian Eregos:** "It's a long way down..."
        
-   In _RuneScape_, the default death message is "Oh dear, you're dead!" When you drink a potion from a _Romeo and Juliet_ parody quest, you get "Oh dear, you're... still alive somehow?" In a certain safe duel, you get "Oh dear, you are nearly dead!"
    -   During Halloween, Death would appear and escort you to the respawn point with various messages.
    -   Some bosses have their own taunts.
        
        **Yk'Lagor the Thunderous**: ANOTHER KILL FOR THE THUNDEROUS!
        
    -   Dungeoneering is just full of them, never mind the bosses...
        -   Crafting Catastrophe
        -   D.I.Y. Disaster
        -   You have a hilarious fishing accident that you would have told your grandchildren some day, had it not killed you.
    -   During the quest "Fate of the Gods", if you die in Freneskae and return to the World Gate to try again, Sliske will keep a running tally and mock your latest demise. He has snarky remarks for your first seven deaths, but from eight on gives up and just whines that your constant dying is boring him.
-   Fitting to the theme of the game, in _City of Heroes_, the strongest bosses will often spout a one-liner upon defeating a player, that can range from badass to hilarious.
    
    **Countess Crey**: And remember! This beating has been brought to you by Crey Industries!
    
-   High-level mobs in ThunderDome MUD will announce player kills over gossip or holler channels: "<Player> thought <he/she> was tough, so I killed <him/her>!" "I killed <player> and looted <his/her> stinkin' corpse! Ha ha!"
-   The Holocrypts of _WildStar_ have a bevy of quips to mock you as they bring you back from the brink.
    
    Death has many secrets... such as: why do you keep returning here?
    

    Platform Games 

-   _The Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures_ features the Nerd's parody of the _Friday the 13th_ Game Over screen:
    
    You're dead
    
    Your friends are dead
    
    Your family's dead
    
    Your fucking pets are being skinned alive
    
    Your mom's a fucking whore
    
    You suck at life
    
    The world hates you
    
    You're going to hell
    
    Live with it
    
    GAME OVER
    
-   In _Astro Marine Corps_, every death is accompanied by a short message. Usually it's a generic "You are dead!!!!" or "AAARRGHH!!!", but one more amusing one is when your head gets bitten off by a monster: "Don't lose your mind!!"
-   In _Battletoads_, Professor T. Bird will make fun of you or say something mocking or condescending every time you continue, and if you get a game over, the Dark Queen will mock you and, in one instance, _eat you._ And this on top of the game being the posterboy for Nintendo Hard!
-   _Canabalt_ announces how far you ran and your cause of death with each Game Over.
-   Episodes 4-6 of _Commander Keen_ have a rather distinctive sound effect for when you lose a life ("do-do-dah! dee-dow-doo!"). It sounds vaguely mocking, particularly when it gets re-triggered by hitting something else dangerous on the way off the screen (or sometimes even the same thing that killed you in the first place). Combined with It's a Wonderful Failure when you get a Game Over in episode 5, where the music is definitely mocking you.
-   _Conker's Bad Fur Day_ has an extended cutscene upon the player's first death explaining the extra life system and introducing Gregg, the Grim Reaper. It also has several death animations and roughly four or five variations of the Game Over sequence.
-   _Crash Bandicoot (1996)_ had a limited set of animations for when you died. _Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back_ and _Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped_, on the other hand, had loads of unique situational deaths, depending on the level, and what enemy killed you. It varied from simply being crushed flat, or falling down a hole, to dying at the kiss of a frog who immediately turned back into a prince, or being hit with a hammer while underground and having a tombstone appear above where you were. One in particular in _Crash 2_ involved being shrunk down to the point of non-existence, but this was so slow, you could inflict another death on Crash and get a miniature version of the death animation.
    -   _Crash Tag Team Racing_ has a Gotta Catch Them All collection of Die-o-Ramas, which are "humorous" cutscenes where Crash is killed in a variety of different-yet-similar ways.
    -   Riding the cute little polar bear into the ice results in a frozen Crash with the bear on top. "Arf, arf".
    -   In _Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped_, one can get hit by a giant wielding a club. Crash will hit the camera and slide down it.
    -   In _Crash of the Titans_ and _Mind Over Mutant_, getting killed by minions would result in them doing victory dances and taunting Crash.
-   DOS game _Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion_ shows you a different animation for each of the 8 ways you can die (Werewolf, zombie, slashed to death...)
-   In _Distorted Travesty_, all of the Game Over messages will relentlessly mock you for losing. 'Have you ever thought about winning?' is one, with another being 'Remember that time you lost? Oh, that's now'. Harsh, especially since the game is _very_ Nintendo Hard. Playing on Easy mode will also make it throw in some Easy-Mode Mockery from time to time: 'You could always lower the difficulty... oh wait, no you can't.' The sequel, on the other hand, gives you encouragement instead, and then the third game goes back to mocking you mercilessly. 'I wrote a book called _You Will Eventually Win_. It's in the fiction section.'
-   When the _Dizzy_ series began to use pop-up text boxes to describe every action, each way to die came with its own message. Generally, they're straightforward accounts of how Dizzy was killed, but sometimes they're rather informative and amusing, such as when Dizzy runs afoul of the vampire in Zaks' castle in _MagicLand Dizzy_: "Zaks' grandmother Vampira bites you and kills you! Who said you can't teach your grandmother to suck eggs?"
-   In _Dubbelmoral!_, the Swedish text on the standard Game Over screen translates to: "You've taken so much damage from the carnival that you die to death. Thus, the game is over!" There are also two Non Standard Game Over messages: "You have become so needy that your bladder has burst", and "You have spit (vomited) on the rector one too many times, he never wants to see you again and has therefore relegated (expelled) you".
-   In _The Fairly OddParents: Shadow Showdown_, dying in some levels - but most prevalent in "Vicky Strikes Back" - will cause Cosmo or Wanda to comment on it. No Game Overs, though, as the game has no lives.
    
    **Cosmo** (when Timmy falls into a certain bottomless pit in "Vicky Strikes Back"): Maybe we should check \[for wish stars\] down here. ...nope, bad idea!
    
-   _Home Improvement: Power Tool Pursuit!_ on the SNES. It doesn't matter how Tim loses a life, the screen goes black and a sketch plays where he stands in place, dazed, while his sons try to snap him out of it. Even if Tim falls down a pit.
-   The sadomasochistically difficult freeware game _I Wanna Be the Guy_ contains a recreation of the famous "IT'S DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE! TAKE THIS" screen from _The Legend of Zelda_, but the sword, like everything else, instantly kills you if you touch it, prompting the message to change to "YOU JUMPED INTO A SWORD, YOU RETARD!".
    -   One screen compounds an already-deadly fall with a giant airplane straight out of _Mario Paint_ flying onto the screen to hit you, complete with a little 8-bit song.
    -   In the Tourian System, you can get attacked by a Metroid. If you do, you turn to dust instead of gibbing, and you don't get the usual game over music, at all.
-   _Kero Blaster_: If Kaeru loses all his lives, he typically wakes up in a hospital room where he can choose to continue and buy health items on the way out, although he may end up in other, functionally identical locations in later stages and modes (such as the C&F kitchen in Zangyou mode). If he refuses to continue, a lighthearted Game Over sequence plays out:
    -   In Normal mode, Sasuke congratulates him for working hard, basically letting him rest.
    -   In Zangyou mode, Sasuke and Kaeru try to go on their vacation anyway (the continue prompt now asking Kaeru if he wants to keep trying his work or just take off with the other two for vacay) to the hot spring, but get chewed out by President Nanao and are refused entry. The game over screen proper features Sasuke and Kaeru back at the office doing heaps of work instead of the cozy vacation they planned.
-   _The Lost Vikings_:
    -   The game will bemoan the level's difficulty and berate the player for dying too many times in one level. If you die too many times, Thor himself will show up and tell you that you suck.
        
        **Baleog**: I'm so familiar with the beginning of this level, I could do my part blindfolded.  
        **Erik**: Yeah, it's too bad the player keeps trying to prove the same thing.
        
    -   In the sequel, this will be combined with Easy-Mode Mockery if you manage to die in the first level. The goddess who resurrects you when you lose a Viking will mock you for dying on the _first flippin' level_ and grant you some new powers to help you along the way. Of course, the objective of the first level is "cross a small valley between two hills" and the valley is so shallow that it requires a collaboration between Eric and Olaf to even achieve a single point of falling damage, so it's more like an Easter Egg than anything else.
-   The DOS game _Xargon 3: Xargon's Fury_ has a room in the final castle with a **"Prepare to die!"** banner hanging from the ceiling; upon entering the room, you immediately plummet into instant-death blades. The door to this room is in a row of 5 identical doors (3 of which eventually lead to required switches or items, & the other leads to a room full of bonus points), making memorization the name of the game in this part of the level.
-   _Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy_ manages to do this and make you hate snarky sidekick Daxter all at the same time. When Jak dies, Daxter climbs atop his body and looks into his eyes, only to make some sarcastic remark at Jak's expense. Must be great for Jak to have the last thing he sees be his alleged best friend making light of his death.
    -   And then, when it's removed in _Jak II: Renegade_, you actually miss it. Of course, _Jak X_ gives you a lovingly detailed image of your car's burning wreckage sliding around a racetrack, so mocking your failure lives on.
    -   It makes a return in _Jak 3: Wastelander_, but only if Jak dies in the exact same manner as in the first game (which is rare for some reason). Given the series' tone up to that point, it's somewhat fitting that Daxter's comments are somewhat more insulting this time around (though still funny).
-   _Jumper 2_ has unlockable features, one of which is "taunt mode." If you turn this option on, the game will display a snarky insult, accompanied by an audible groan, every time you die. Also, regardless of whether you're being actively mocked, the game keeps track of how many times — and in what ways — you died. Beating this Nintendo Hard game likely means dying hundreds of times, and striving for One 100% Completion may involve dying _thousands_ of times.
-   _Kid Icarus_: "I'M FINISHED!"
-   In the DS version of _N+_, death results in only a single, two word message. "NICE ONE". Death Is a Slap on the Wrist, but it's still harsh.
-   _RosenkreuzStilette_ features a specific game over screen for every level. Each one is a Shout-Out to another video game.
    -   In Story Mode, the bosses have their own monologues when your last life is lost. For example:
        
        **Trauare:** You're much better off forgetting what you can't change.  
        **Freudia:** I expected no less.  
        **Zeppelin:** ...A fitting end for a traitor.
        
    -   The boss with the best monologues happens to be, without a doubt, Grolla, because, of course, she's just that badass.
        
        **Grolla**: ...Pathetic.  
        **Grolla**: Is that all you've got?
        
-   _Skunny: Save Our Pizzas_:
    -   If you repeatedly fall into the pits or use a bomb on yourself, the game will ask "Are you suicidal?"
    -   Being killed by an enemy Roman brings up the message "Romans have bad attitudes!"
-   _Spelunky_: When you die, the journal will endlessly replay your last moments, catalog what you were killed by, and have a first-person description of your player's final thoughts.
-   If you lose all of your lives in _Stinkoman 20X6_, the Game Over screen will actually show a badly beaten-up Stinkoman saying "My stummy hurts..." This is changed to 1UP if you die on the level where you play as him, and if you die on the level where you're trying to keep 1UP safe until you can get your power crunch back from him, you get both of them, and the message, "Our stummies hurt..."
-   _Super Mario Galaxy_: "TOO BAD!!!"
    -   Also, if you make it to the end of the Battlerock or Dreadnought purple coin missions without all the purple coins, the Gearmo at the end will mock you for not trying hard enough and you'll end up losing a life.
    -   A funny thing in Battlerock's purple coin mission is that if you get absolutely ZERO purple coins, the Gearmo will refer to herself as "this old iron lady", suggesting they're made of iron.
-   iOS's _Temple Run_ has numerous examples. "Trees hurt" (run into a tree), "Smells like toast" (fire), or simply "Mind the gap" (jump a little short and hit the front of the next platform) are examples of it. It's even better than that. Every death is accompanied by a picture of the protagonist's fate, and some of the messages vary depending on which character you were playing as.

    Puzzle Games 

-   _Dweep_ has only one way to die (by incineration), but numerous possible death messages for the occasion.
-   _A Game of Life and Death_ is an original puzzle game in Choose your own Adventure format and is filled with puns, gag pictures, and general pokes at the reader's screw-ups upon death.
-   In _Meteos_, losing in a multiplayer match results in the message "You Lose! ANNIHILATION!" In single-player, you instead get the message "GAME OVER — ANNIHILATION!"
-   When you die in _Kindergarten_ and its sequel, the game gives you a hint on how to avoid the demise in question. Sometimes these hints are a bit on the snarky side, such as when you shake down a beehive in the second game, with predictable results.
    
    You died. Angry bees are bad for your health.
    
-   _Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition_, when you die in One-Life Mode, plays a Scare Chord and displays "YOU DIED" along with an X-eyed Ori face.
-   _Portal 2_:
    -   During the chapter "The Part Where He Kills You". Right after you escape Wheatley's initial deathtrap, he pleads with you to come back. If you do, then he acts surprised, and says he didn't plan for that. He then tries to convince you to jump into the pit, and if you do, he remarks, "Oh! Wow! Good! I didn't think that was going to work." He says the same thing if you take his "death option" later by walking into a crusher.
    -   In co-op mode, GLaDOS expresses disappointment when the bots die, such as "If I made these tests any easier, they wouldn't be tests." Falling down a Bottomless Pit in the Hub Level has her ask how you can fail at something that isn't even a test.
-   Though losing a match in any of the _Puyo Puyo_ games doesn't necessarily lead to death, many of the roster's loss animations take this trope into mind.
    -   Even the win quotes from the opponent (or even _you_, if you were the winner) can be outright brutal to even see, even if the winning party's character was being nice about the other's defeat. Some examples from _Puyo Puyo Tetris 2_:
        
        **Schezo**: Hmph. Pitiful. If all you wanted was to become a rust stain on my blade, you must've been desperate.
        
        **Rafisol**: I will take everything. Fun, love, victory... EVERYTHING.
        
        **Rozatte**: To take on someone so much stronger than you... Well, your heart was in the right place, at least.
        
-   Dying in _Quantum Conundrum_ yields a message telling you things that the child player character will now never experience, all of which can be found here.
-   The goal of _Reventure_ is to find all of its 100 hidden endings. Many of them involve dying in creative ways, which the ending text is quick to mock.
-   From _Tetris: The Grand Master 3_: "EXCELLENT! but...let's go better next time".

    Rail Shooters 

-   Occasionally, on player 1 running out of lives in _Razing Storm_: "Who gave you permission to take a hit, Alpha 1?!"

    Real Time Strategy 

-   The expansion pack of _Age of Empires_, _Rise of Rome_, includes texts about the consequences of your defeat in campaign scenarios. These often include requests by the superiors full of Bond One Liners, such as "report to Catapult Unit XIV where you'll get another chance to have an impact on the Carthaginians".
-   The first three _Command & Conquer_ games (_Tiberian Dawn_, _Red Alert_, and _Tiberian Sun_) had around 20-30 short videos per side. Some of them applied to the mission, such as blowing up a bridge (video shows a convoy driving over it as it explodes) while some are more/less generic, such as the scorpion being killed by an Eagle, or an APC barging into a base, knocking over the enemy flag, then soldiers jump out and raise theirs.
-   The somewhat obscure RTS _Dark Colony_ had also a different cut-scene for mission accomplished and mission failed.

    Rhythm Games 

-   In _beatmania IIDX 19 Lincle_ and _20 tricoro_, if you fail a Dan course, your "Q-pro" avatar is shown crying on the evaluation screen. Starting in _beatmania IIDX 21 SPADA_, failing a song on a Life Meter variety that kills you if emptied out will show a box on the result screen with the caption "DEAD" and the exact measure and note number that you failed at.
-   In the _DanceDanceRevolution_ series, if you fail a song, one thing the announcer will say is "You got _burned_!" Others include "You need more practice for sure.", "That's not what I wanted to see...", and "Dancing? That was _dancing_?!" He'll also continuously insult (or compliment, if you're doing well) you during the course of the song. The announcer of 1st-5th was especially emotional, from actually lamenting when you broke a 100+ combo, to telling you outright "Your moves are _lame_!". He even spoke Japanese in one of his game over quotes: "Ashita ga aru sa!" ("There's always a tomorrow!"), which makes its return (in English this time!) in the DDRMAX series.
-   _DJ Max_:
    -   From _DJMAX Online_: "U NEED MORE PRACTICE - **GAME OVER**"
    -   The same Game Over screen from _DJMAX Online_ appears in _DJMAX Portable_...with the two lines flipped, so it's now "**GAME OVER** - U NEED MORE PRACTICE".
    -   The announcer in most newer (handheld) games: "You need more practice! Never give it up!"
    -   _DJMAX Technika 2_ and _3_: "YOU FAILED. GAME OVER."
-   In _Groove Coaster_, if your navigator has a unique voice and you fail a song, they'll have something to say about it.
    
    **Linka:** Build up longer chains by making fewer mistakes. Huge scores await!
    
-   _In the Groove_: "LIFE DEPLETED. ROUND FAILED." with a skull in the background if you fail Pandemonium and "ROUND FAILED ^2" if you failed Vertex^2 (the hardest songs in the first and second game, respectively).
-   In _Nostalgia_, failing a song results in a "Finish..." message (as opposed to "It's fantastic!" for a clear), as if the game's saying, "well uh, you made it to the end of the song, I guess?"
-   Many of the _Popn Music_ characters' fail animations fall under this trope. Nyami (in _Pop'n Music 16_) sulks over a ruined party, Cup-kun tips over, Timer sulks in the rain while his Cheerful Child Cosplay Otaku Girl sister Minit's comforts him, etc.
-   In the _Pump It Up_ series, this runs the gamut between "Yeah, I know you can!" when you select a song, to "Why don't you just get up and dance, man?" followed by the Game Over screen when you lose.
-   _QWOP_, which lies somewhere between rhythm and sports games, tells you off the bat that "it's not about winning or losing", and the so-called "try again" screen is done like a certificate of attendance.
-   If the player deletes one of their bands in _Rock Band 4_, they are treated to a message saying _"<Band name> has broken up,"_ followed by a randomly generated reason.
    -   _"You had to disband as part of a very weird, very generous plea agreement."_
    -   _"Perhaps you finally realized that no one shared your passion for 17-minute improvised bridge sections."_
    -   _"Don't think of it as a break-up so much as an... um... yeah, it's a break-up."_
    -   _"No matter what you did, you just couldn't get your bandmates to quit referring to you as 'the unstable one'."_

    Roguelike 

-   _Ancient Domains of Mystery_:
    -   "\[player character\] died from choking on his own vomit" (i.e. suffered a fatal fever attack whilst paralyzed). How rockstar.
    -   More fun with _ADOM_: if you're too heavily burdened, you can break your neck falling down stairs. Kicking any stairway can make the dungeon collapse on you. If you're carrying too much weight when your Strength of Atlas spell wears off, you'll be squashed by your own inventory. Entering a dark space if you're doomed can get you eaten by a grue. Step on an altar at the wrong moment, and you become an inadvertent live sacrifice. Try for a special ending with the wrong equipment, and the denizens of the ChAoS plane will rip you to shreds. And those are just some of the more _obscure_ ways to die.
-   _Dungeons of Dredmor_, a satire of Rogue Like games, takes great delight in your death ("Congratulations! You Have Died.") The main character knows he probably won't last long as well.
-   Downplayed in _Elona_. When an attack connects with a character, the message window displays "The \[attack\] hits the \[enemy\]". If said attack also takes away the character's last Hit Point, then an extra bit of text describing how the character dies is added depending on the attack's element. This can also happen to you, so being killed by an ice attack will result in "The bolt hits you and turns you into an ice sculpture!", being killed by a sound attack will give "You shatter to atoms!", a mind attack will say "You lose your mind and commit a suicide!", and so on.
-   In _Hades_, there are two sources of these. Dying trying to escape the Underworld will return you to the House of Hades, where you're greeted by Hypnos, who may comment on what killed you and offer a helpful tip (generally along the lines of "have you tried not getting hit"). If Zagreus does manage to escape Hades he still dies shortly thereafter, and after he convinces Persephone to return to the Underworld this is accompanied by the narrator explaining how he died. Frequently this is something extremely stupid or embarrassing, such as "tried to pet a snake" or "ran headfirst into a wall painted to look like the exit".
-   _NetHack_ gives you a nice ASCII tombstone with a "killed by" line. Here is a spoiler list of possibilities. And here is a list of the most common deaths on the largest public _Nethack_ server. Note that "Ascended" means the player won, and less than 1% of the attempts ended that way. There's always a "Do you want your possessions identified?" prompt, with the implication of "...so you can see what, exactly, you had that would have saved you? (y/n/STFU)". Other examples include:
    -   "RIP Bob, killed by elementary physics" is the tombstone you get when you throw a dagger, sword, boulder, etc. directly upwards.
    -   You can be 'petrified by elementary physics' if the object you threw straight up was a cockatrice/chickatrice corpse and you weren't wearing a helmet.
    -   You can be "killed by elementary chemistry" if you dip a water potion into an acid potion instead of vice-versa. Remember your chemistry lessons, kids - "do like you oughta, add acid to water".
-   When a _One Way Heroics_ character's HP hits zero, before seeing the Game Over screen, you are shown a text screen describing your character's death.
    -   Death from an enemy attack describes your character getting knocked down, but failing to get up, while the monster looks at them hungrily.
    -   Failure to escape the Advancing Wall of Doom results in being painfully crushed and then launched into the air, where the hero can catch a glimpse of the dragon responsible for the darkness before dying.
    -   Die from damage over time by being lit on fire, and you get a disturbingly graphic description of your character painfully asphyxiating from the burning smoke.

    Role-Playing Games 

-   In the online Flash RPG _AdventureQuest_, sometimes you go to Death, who will return you for reasons other than having a filled quota. Your death also varies based on your armor equipped.
-   _The Age of Decadence_: Many of the game's combat encounters have unique Game Over text that narrates your character's final thoughts before dying, which differs based on the situation at hand. The developers likely took the time to write these due to the high frequency at which players are expected to die.
-   In the Xbox game _The Bard's Tale_, the narrator (voiced by _Tony Jay_) took delight in the untimely passing of the protagonist character, often making snide remarks on the ineptitude of the Bard or how he 'loves a happy ending.'
-   _Betrayal at Krondor_ has these, sort of. There are book-style text screens for every major and minor occurrence, and each different way to die yields different descriptions — whether you were killed by a trap, defeated by enemies, fell into a pit, tried to light a torch in a mine heavy with naptha fumes, starved in the Sleeping Glades, or annoyed the half-dead gods of Timiranya by repeatedly trying to walk into a restricted area.
-   _Dragon Quest_: "Thou art dead". Although, Death Is a Slap on the Wrist here, for it only boots you back to the castle minus half your gold.
-   If you die in _Dungeon Siege_, the game will display random messages like "X would probably love to be resurrected", or "X bought the farmhouse".
-   _Fallout_ and _2_ talks of your demise over your dead corpse as the narrator speaks of your impending doom and how the village and humanity is doomed. _Fallout 3_ is not as bad, but still shows how your character dies before respawning moments before your demise. Some of these could get especially humorous or harsh, depending on the cause of it. One particularly memorable phrase: "Boy, are you dumb. And dead."
-   _Jade Empire_:
    -   The game usually gives you a helpful tip after the following message: "You have died." At some point, the game runs out of tips, and just says "You have died." in the tip box.
    -   If the MC has his/her HP completely depleted against their combat duel with Sir Roderick, instead of the usual style of the MC falling to his/her knees, Sir Roderick rubs in a final line of mockery to his defeated opponent before finishing him/her off with his Mirabelle blunderbuss rifle.
-   In _Live A Live_, Game Over sequences are accompanied by an animation showing how the protagonists die or what happens after that. Some of them are lighthearted, like Pogo's Animal Companion Gori laughing or Masaru's opponent mocking him, others are not, and the worst one includes the entire universe across all time being destroyed.
-   Dying in the action/adventure game _Nox_ leads to a stylized picture of your death and the Big Bad mocking you.
-   The _Tales Series_ usually has the line "And they were never heard from again..." or some variation appear before the game presents you with the option to reload a save, continue, or quit. The bosses also sometimes throw in some last words (usually insulting) before the game over screen appears.
    -   The PS2 remake of _Tales of Destiny_ actually replaces the usual quote with dialogue from the boss who just killed you, generally in the case of human bosses.
    -   In _Tales of the Abyss_, you'll get a skit at the game over screen telling you what you should do the next time you try to fight the boss that killed you.
    -   _Tales of Vesperia_ usually has the standard Tales game over message, but the deviation comes from the person who was the last to die in your party, who will be the one voicing the line. A special case is the last battle — if you die during the battle, it's the last boss who voices the line.
-   _Wasteland_ is well-known for having colorful descriptions of deaths in combat, though those apply for enemies too. These include "exploding like a blood sausage" and "reduced into an undertaker's nightmare".
-   _Secret of Mana_: "Sadly, no trace of them was ever found." It's always the same game over message, but it's still rather depressing. _Secret of Evermore_ did this too, with your name replacing "them".
-   Lose any fight against Lavos in _Chrono Trigger_ (except during the Ocean Palace), and you get to see said monster burrowing out of the earth and unleashing The End of the World as We Know It. "But the future refused to change." _Chrono Cross_ manages to top this by erasing Serge from existence entirely every time you game over.
-   In the _Mother_ series, losing a battle sends your character to The Nothing After Death, under a spotlight (The _Earthbound_ version is particularly eerie). The narrator then asks if you want to try again (in _Mother_ and _Earthbound_, he's very optimistic, but in _Mother 3_, he just says "Retry?"). Saying yes in _Mother 3_ has your character stand up and do a pose.
-   _Planescape: Torment_: Since the Nameless One can't die for good, his death leads to Morte being sarcastic about the circumstances. "Great... _another_ trip to the Mortuary."
-   _Demon's Souls_: "**YOU DIED** - Phantom, you were not able to achieve your goal. You must leave this world." Its Spiritual Successor, _Dark Souls_, instead just gives you "**YOU DIED**".
-   _Elden Ring_ keeps the 'YOU DIED', but also gives most bosses and some NPCs voiced lines after they kill a player.
    
    **Margit**: Put these foolish ambitions to rest.
    
    **Godrick** (phase 1): Lowly Tarnished... Thou'rt unfit even to graft...
    
    **Morgott** (phase 2): May the curse seep to thy very soul.
    
    **Malenia** (Phase 1): I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
    
-   In the _Henry Stickmin Series_, most of the choices you make will result in either an improbable event leading to failure, such as a guard throwing up his arms just in time to deflect a tranquilizer dart, which then ricochets to hit you, or Reality Ensuing about the effects of the sci-fi devices you use. You will then be mocked relentlessly in the FAIL screen.
-   In _Hylics_ and its sequel, suffering a TPK will treat the player to a cutscene of Wayne's flesh melting off his bones.
-   The _Drakensang_\-prequel is framed as a hero's companion telling the adventure to the daughter of another companion. If your group gets wiped out she will protest and he will claim that he was merely checking if she was paying attention.
-   _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_: You can be on the receiving end of special kill animations from enemies. If you get killed by a dragon, for example, it can play an animation where it bites down and shakes you around like a rat in a rottweiler's maw, before throwing your dead body aside. Some high-level bandits can cut your head off. And then there's famously what happens when you get hit by a Giant.
-   _Undertale_ has three versions of this:
    -   The first is the generic Game Over screen whenever you die, telling you to hold on and stay determined to continue your quest.
    -   The second is against the boss of the Neutral path, where he will tell you it's all just a bad dream... _and you're never waking up_, followed by an evil, screen-filling laugh and him crashing your game.
    -   The third and biggest is against the No Mercy route's boss, who actively rubs his victory over you whenever you come back for another match. _Especially_ if you fall to his trickery.
        
        _Heya. You look frustrated about something. Guess I'm pretty good at my job, huh?_  
        _Hmm. that expression... that's the expression of someone who's died twice in a row. Suffice to say, you look really... unsatisfied. All right. How 'bout we make it a third?_  
        _That's the expression of somebody who's died thrice in a row. Hey, what comes after "thrice", anyway? Wanna help me find out?_  
        _That's the expression of somebody who's died quice in a row. Quice? Frice? Welp, won't have to use it again anyways._  
        _That's the expression of someone who's died five times in a row. Convenient, huh? that's one for each finger. But soon... you'll need a cool mutant hand to count all of your deaths._
        
-   In _Shin Megami Tensei IV_, when your party is defeated, you wake up at the shore of the River Styx, with Charon greeting you. And if you're a repeat customer, he dryly remarks that "you died so carelessly." Either way, due to Charon being massively overworked, he'll extend an offer to take you back to the world of the living, if you are willing to pay his relatively steep cost of Macca or use Nintendo 3DS Play Coins.
-   In _Final Fantasy VII Remake_, Kotch offers color commentary throughout the battle with Hell House in the Corneo Coliseum and if Cloud and Aerith are defeated, he will comment on this dramatically as well at the Game Over screen.
-   The 1974-1975 _dnd_ game will mock you for triggering traps and dying with exclamations like "You clumsy dolt!"

    Shoot 'em Up 

-   _Traffic Department 2192_.
    -   Standard death shows your character's dossier being updated ("Status: Active" to "Status: Deceased"). Episode 1, Mission 17 requires you to defend Traffic Department headquarters from enemy hoverskids while they try to get their shields back online. Since it's the only(?) mission you can fail despite not dying, it gets a short dialogue between your enemy and his superior, to the effect of, "It appears you do have everything under control after all. Well done."
    -   You can fail a few of the escort missions too, some of which lead to a game over, whereas others allow you to continue but with a black mark against your record (that has no actual effect on the game). In one of the missions where you have to protect a medical convoy, if they all get destroyed, a scene is shown where your character comes back and claims she doesn't care that they've been destroyed, only to be informed that they were vital, and then the game forces you to restart the level.
-   Not actually deaths (unless you lose to Medicine), but _Touhou Project_ has this in two games:
    -   _Touhou Eiyashou ~ Imperishable Night_ has a "game clock" where reaching 6 AM results in Game Over. (Running out of lives gives you the option to continue, adding half an hour to the clock, two lives to your stock, and an inability to reach the Perfect Run Final Boss.) Running out of time gives you the standard Bad Ending, with the heroines going home in disgrace, vowing to do better next time.
    -   _Touhou Kaeidzuka ~ Phantasmagoria of Flower View_ features lines from your opponent if you run out of lives against them (you get the option to continue after they mock you). This can be anywhere from Reimu telling you to stop causing trouble to Komachi (mistakenly) lamenting your suicidal tendencies.
-   _Operation Wolf_: "You have sustained a lethal injury. Sorry, but you are finished... here." The alternate game over: "Since you have no ammunition left, you must join the hostages." Strangely enough, you still had to wait until you ran out of life before that happened (during which time you'd get one bullet back every few seconds).
-   _Gradius_, with the exception of _Gradius V_ - if you die and run out of all your Vic Vipers, the voice messages give you some cheery insults such as "Come on! We're just getting started!" If you do not continue, the strangely cheerful Game Over music plays.
    -   If you complete 7 stages before getting a Game Over, the announcer goes "What the hell?"
    -   In _Gradius Gaiden_, the announcer's death comments get more disparaging the further you go. From the standard "Try again" in earlier stages, to more insulting ones such as "Poor boy!", "It is cold in space", "Get Out! of here, forget about it!", to a straight-up Evil Laugh.
-   The infamous "Game Over - Why don't you try hard?" screen from Cave shmup _DonPachi_. Even if you clear both loops and beat the game, you'll still get the same Game Over screen after the ending. What, that wasn't trying hard enough?
-   _Hellsinker_:
    -   "THE **GAME** HAS BEEN **OVER** — On Your Decision, It's Absolutely."
    -   Then there's the infamous Segment 7 Non-Standard Game Over: "SPIRIT OVERLOAD. YOU GOT INSANITY. YOU MUST RESHAPE ONESELF FOR ONCOMING ASPIRANTS."
-   _Gorf_ would taunt a player that lost with an electronic voice saying "Game over, Spaaaaaaaace Cadet!"
-   What happens if you let the final boss of whatever path you've chosen get away in _Aero Fighters Special_? The bad endings shows the boss destroying the Earth or Mars and the game outright mocks you for your failure.
-   Run out of shields in _Raptor: Call of the Shadows_, you are treated to a two-clip cutscene of your fighter crashing and the pilot being slumped forward in the wreck.
-   In _Cuphead_, whenever you die the enemies or boss of the stage give you a pun-filled or rhyming taunt of some sort. In the case of the bosses, their taunts change depending on what phase they were in when you died.

    Simulation Games 

-   _Afterlife (1996)_:
    -   If you spend too long in debt, the Powers That Be will unleash the FOUR SURFERS OF THE APOCALYPSO<small>◊</small> upon your afterlife. At this point, the skeletal surfers ride through both Heaven and Hell on surfboards and waves of lava until both map quadrants are reduced to molten lava. The Surfers will also show up in the demo version of the game if you play for too long.
    -   Other ways to get a game over include having too many unemployed demons and angels (who proceed to start Armageddon out of sheer boredom), influencing the mortal world to have high Wrath when they're sufficiently advanced (which leads to nuclear war wiping out all the EMBOs and putting both afterlives out of a job), letting the belief that there is no afterlife spread too far (which _also_ puts them out of a job, now that no one's coming through the gates anymore), letting too many lost SOULs drift out of your afterlives (which causes the Powers That Be to just shut the whole thing down and force Heaven and Hell to fall from sheer exasperation) or just using cheats too many times (which leads to _Death Stars_ destroying Heaven and Hell). Any way it happens, game over is accompanied by pithy remarks from your advisors:
        
        **Jasper:** ...I'd say it's been nice working with you, but that would be lying. Then again, demons always lie, so may I say what a pleasure...
        
-   The standard game over screen of _F/A-18 Hornet_ displays the message "Pilot Killed on Scheduled Mission", or in later versions, "Small Town Honors Pilot who Died During Mission", along with a photo of the pilot's funeral and the last three notes of "Taps".
-   In _Life: the Game_, most of the losing endings have some kind of witty message, although only two of those are about your actual death.
-   _The Sims_ can get snarky when all the sims on a lot die. One reminds the players that The Sims is a _life_ simulator, not a _death_ simulator.
-   It's not your death, but your patient's, in Surgeon Simulator 2013 that elicits a "**Surgery Failed.** And it was going so well, too... Brutal murder achieved in a mere <time>". That said, the success message ("Surgery Complete. Looks fine to me, I'm sure he'll live...") is just about as ominous.
-   _Trauma Center_:
    -   "The Medical Board will be notified. **Operation Failed.**"
    -   In _New Blood_: "Your skills were not up to the task. **Operation Failed.**" In operations where you're up against Stigma or GUILT, this makes more sense than being subject to disciplinary action just because you didn't know how to deal with a biological weapon that neither you nor your superiors have much knowledge about.
-   The original _Warhawk_ (for the original PlayStation) featured some rather descriptive (and very long-winded) accounts of your death, depending on what mission you happen to die on. These ranged from dying slowly in the burning wreckage of your craft to actually indirectly taking down the Big Bad by causing him to laugh so hard at your failure that he chokes to death.

    Sports Games 

-   The _Tony Hawk's Pro Skater_ games have them; if you skate into water or through the Invisible Wall; they include "no swimming/water... baaaad!/you're hosed!" for the former and "don't do drugs!/stay in school!" for the latter (complete with making your character bail from _American Wasteland_ onward), along with many others. Subverted as your skater doesn't die. He just respawns immediately after, at the nearest checkpoint.

    Stealth-Based Games 

-   _Metal Gear Solid_: "Snake! You can't do that! The future will be changed! You'll create a time paradox!"
    -   "You've created a time paradox! Snake, you can't go changing the future like that!" Messages like these about time paradoxes happen in prequel games when a character dies who's supposed to survive into later games.
    -   "Snake! Peace Walker has launched the nuke! It's all over."
    -   "Duh nuhnuhnuh nuh nuh, DUN DUN DUN!" (If you repeatedly do really badly in _Peace Walker_, a random member of the main cast (Snake, Miller, Paz, Amanda, Chico, Huey, Cécile, or Strangelove) will sing along with the Game Over music. Some are better singers than others.)
-   _Dishonored_: "You have met your demise".
-   _Styx: Shards of Darkness_ has Styx himself appearing on the game over screen to berate or mock the player for his/her lack of skill, with gems like "News Flash : the "Jump" button is not located between your ass cheeks! Or maybe it is for you, I don't know."
-   _Tenchu Stealth Assassins_: Whenever you die to a boss, a cutscene will play showing said boss' reaction to your demise. Most will gleefully brag/taunt you, but some of them will express regret at having to kill you (Genbu from _Tenchu 2_ should Ayame lose to him in their final battle) or acknowledge you as a Worthy Opponent (such as the master swordsman from the first game's outpost level, but _only_ if you fight him as Rikimaru).

    Survival Horror 

-   Getting killed in _Amnesia: The Dark Descent_ often results in a screen explaining what you were supposed to do so you wouldn't die, like "Stay out of the water". Some deaths just get "You must carry on", indicating that your death hasn't resulted in a loss of progress.
-   _Mr. Hopp's Playhouse 2_: If you get caught by an enemy, or if you make too much noise, a black screen will display this message in red:
    
    YOU WERE CAUGHT/TOO LOUD
    
    TRY AGAIN
    
-   _Resident Evil_ dabbles in this, with many games flashing the words "YOU DIED" or "YOU ARE DEAD" in bloody text. _Resident Evil 2_ stands out by featuring an animation of whatever monster took off the last of your health finishing you off (zombies biting into your neck before piling on you to eat you, zombie dogs ripping out your throat, Lickers slashing you, Mr. X crushing your head under his boot, etc.).
-   Almost every animatronic in _Ultimate Custom Night_ has several unique, fully-voiced lines that they say when you get killed by them, ranging from humorous to scary. One that stands out is Mr. Hippo, who rambles on for at least three minutes whenever he kills you, and you _cannot_ skip it or do anything to stop it (even trying to quit the game doesn't work).
    -   And in _Five Nights at Freddy's AR: Special Delivery_, whether you lose to an animatronic, the offscreen kids express their disappointment. However, certain animatronics, like _Ultimate Custom Night_, have unique, fully-voiced lines that only play on the “You Lost” screen.

    Third-Person Shooters 

-   The seminal _Zarch!_ (_Virus 1988_ on the Amiga), a notoriously difficult game, can actually award the player negative scores. If you die while your score is still negative, you might end up unfavorably compared to a slug or a dried up piece of lichen.
-   _Metroid: Other M_ has Adam Malkovich shout worriedly at Samus as her suit disappears and she collapses to the ground. When the plot made it so Adam wasn't available, this was removed.
    
    "Samus! What's going on?! Respond! RESPOOOND-!"
    
-   _Monday Night Combat_ announcer Mickey Cantor will frequently quip about players being gunned down by robots during the game. Since the players are clones who respawn when they're killed, this happens often. If you get killed by the weakest robots, his words get particularly humiliating.
    
    "Ooh, an Ice Man is cloaked and smoked thanks to a Gremlin."
    
    "And a Hot Shot gets a pine condo courtesy of a Black Jack bot: sleeps one, no stairs."
    
    "The Bouncers wrap up another package, this time with a Hot Shots team member for the bow."
    
    "Oh, there's a surprise. A Slim bot frags an Ice Man. I don't know why, but that sounds disgusting."
    
-   _S4 League_: "You were dominated by _\[player\]_! What a shame!"
-   If you fail a test in the Octo Expansion DLC in _Splatoon 2_, the ink pack attached to you blows up, along with the TEST FAILED message. _Splatoon 3_ has O.R.C.A. highlight you with a spotlight before dumping a bucket of slime on you.

    Turn-Based Strategy 

-   In _Kannons and Katapults_, the three defeat scenarios — assassination, defeat in battle, or having your castle destroyed — are each accompanied by a novelistic paragraph about your death (at least one of them involving suicide). The opponent, King Computer, gets his own set of paragraphs in similar style as a way of saying A Winner Is You.

    Turn-Based Tactics 

-   The _Worms_ series, starting from the second game, has a number of various Bond One-Liner style death messages for the individual worms, like "Worm 1 couldn't swim", "Worm 2 has slipped off the hook", or "Worm 3 was of no use anyway"; _Worms 2_ also includes special messages when the whole team gets wiped out.

    Visual Novels 

-   Both _Tsukihime_ and _Fate/stay night_ have a cheerful hint corner that you can view after meeting a bad end. "Teach Me Ciel-Sensei" in Tsukihime, with Ciel and Neko-Arc giving advice, and in _Fate/stay night_ the "Tiger Dojo" with Tiga and Illya giving the advice. They're actually helpful in telling you how you screwed up, but the comedic nature of them can create Mood Whiplash (which the Tiger Dojo, oddly, actually _warns_ about). Of course, if you pick an obviously wrong choice, you're more likely to get mocked than receive a hint.
-   _Monster Girl Quest_ not only shows you what the opponent is going to do to you afterwards, you also have the option of asking Ilias for an evaluation afterwards. She soon starts accusing you of losing on purpose.

    Wide Open Sandbox 

-   In _Scarface: The World Is Yours_, if you die, it simply states in text: "You fucked up". If you get too much heat from the police, the game simply tells you "You're fucked" as infinite cops swarm in to kill you quickly.
-   _Minecraft_:
    -   When a player dies, a humorous message pops up in the chat window that varies depending on the death.
        
        \[player\] tried to swim in lava. (Died inside lava)  
        \[player\] hit the ground too hard. (Fell to death)  
        \[player\] experienced kinetic energy. (Plowed into a wall while flying too fast with Elytra wings)  
        \[player\] went out with a bang. (Killed by a firework explosion.)  
        \[player\] decided they didn't want to live in the same world as \[player/mob\]. (Fell into the void after being damaged by another in-game entity.)
        
    -   Falling into the void (or using the /kill command that deals the same damage) prints out two lines.
        
        \[player\] fell out of the world.  
        Ouch. That looks like it hurt.
        
    -   Multiplayer server admins can also customize this list to their hearts' content.
    -   Mods can add their own death messages, sometimes even more darkly comedic than those of vanilla _Minecraft_ due to their unofficial nature:
        
        \[player\] got in the way of progress (Died to a _RailCraft_ tunnel bore)  
        On sale! \[player\] Blood Jelly (Died to a _RailCraft_ crusher)  
        \[player\] failed to become the guy (Died to a creative-tier _Extra Utilities_ spike)  
        \[player\] was naughty and got punished by _Draconic Evolution_!<sup>Explanation (spoilers?)&nbsp;</sup> 
        
-   _Terraria_ mocks you this way but also does this to avoid confusion. Deaths leave tombstones that players can read, and even re-edit for the sake of comedy. Some of them are humorous; a lot are horrific.
    
    Redigit was turned into a pile of flesh by Blue's Dynamite.  
    \[Player\] tried to swim in lava.  
    \[Player\]'s face was torn off by Unicorn.  
    \[PlayerX\] was brutally dissected by \[PlayerY's\] Excalibur.  
    \[Player\] didn't bounce.
    
    -   There's a strange (glitched) one when a player keeps hitting a demon altar with anything but a pwnhammer.
        
        \[Player\]
        
        -   Also happens when you are killed by one of the Moon Lord's hands. Specifically, the mouth of them. May also induce Nothing Is Scarier to players that aren't at the combat zone.
-   Whenever you die in _Sunset Overdrive_ you respawn with a variety of goofy animations that range from being dropped out of a UFO, tossed out a van or leaving a time-traveling DeLorean. This also happens in the plot itself, where the protagonist will also respawn after something that should have killed them.

## Non-video game examples:

    Anime and Manga 

-   In _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, a parody of the one used in games like _Tsukihime_ is drawn by Haruna when Negi's group gets sent by Chao one week into a future where the Masquerade is broken and Negi is imprisoned by the mage teachers.
    
    **BAD END**  
    **"School Festival Chao Lingshen Arc"**  
    **Ermine End No.16**  
    After that, he spent 6 months as an ermine  
    and never returned to Mahora Gakuen again...  
    Think about where you made the wrong choice.  
    Was it alright to hold a strategy meeting at Eva's resort during the night of day two?  
    Was it alright for you to enter the Mahora Martial Arts Tournament so carelessly?  
    Was saving Chao and accepting her time machine the right thing to do in the first place?  
    Return to the previous save point and try again.  
    You should be able to discover the clues to advancing!
    
-   While it isn't used in its usual context, the Tiger Dojo from _Fate/stay night_ makes an appearance in _Carnival Phantasm_ as the Next Episode preview. Sadly there is no reference (or team up with) Ask me! Ciel-sensei.
-   The DVD of _Fate/Zero_ included the Einzbern Consultation Room, effectively a prequel to the Tiger Dojo. This features the Servents who were all defeated who talk about their regrets and hopes before moving forward to the Holy Grail.

    Card Games 

-   The monster cards in the _Munchkin_ card game describe "Bad Stuff" that happens if you fail to defeat them or escape from them, which, in the case of many higher-level monsters, means death. Perhaps the most memorable "Bad Stuff" is for Squidzilla: "You are grabbed, slimed, crushed, and gobbled. You are dead, dead, dead. Any questions?" (The creators later had to clarify that you only actually die once.)
    -   Nothing beats getting killed by Great Cthulhu. "Not only do you die, but everyone who isn't you goes up a level _just to mock you_. And your new character is a cultist."
    -   In _Munchkin Bites_, the level 20 monster is a Thesaurus (mainly because vampire roleplayers' pretentiousness and liking of big words is the Running Joke of the game). Naturally, its Bad Stuff is a Hurricane of Euphemisms for you being dead.
    -   The Plasmid from _Star Munchkin_ "burns you to a small, crispy, **dead** flake. Then it steps on you. Then it laughs.".
    -   The Itsy Bitsy Spider "gives you an itsy bitsy bite, and you DIE."
-   In the _Yu-Gi-Oh! Nightmare Troubadour_, Game Over could only happen if you lost a Shadow Game, with a quote from the person who defeated you appearing. One that is really grating...
    
    Ha ha... I knew you couldn't do it.
    

    Comic Books 

-   _Guardians of the Galaxy (2020):_ When Peacebringer the Chitauri turns out to be a suicide bomber at a diplomatic conference, he prefaces his declarations to kill everyone by apologizing for the delay. Y'know, in _killing them_. As the issue goes on, he gets increasingly agitated as everyone's trying to remove and defuse his bomb, but never stops apologizing and telling everyone to stay calm while he's at it, even when he's finally dragged off.

    Fanfiction 

-   _PONIES The Anthology II_ parodies this with "Pony Quest I".
    
    If you had been paying attention to Pinkie's tail 20 screens ago you would have seen this coming. Oh well.  
    Thank you for playing Pony Quest I. We are very sorry that you are not smart enough to beat our game.  
    Now go read a book or something.
    
-   _Fate Revelation Online_:
    -   There are omakes where Shirou dies and visits the Tiger Dojo from the original visual novel, only with Saber standing in for Ilya. In it, Taiga and Saber point out the mistakes Shirou made and advise him to do better next time. Except the first time this happens, Shirou points out he's dead because Rin accidentally got him killed from outside the game, and he had no control over it. After an awkward pause, Taiga glosses over this as unimportant.
    -   Kotomine's Church for Bad Guys is a repeat show for minor characters who die in omakes. Kotomine offers them some useful but painful advice while Gilgamesh treats them with barely concealed disdain.
    -   Imouto Dojo is reserved for Kirito dying in an omake, at which point he receives advice from Suguha.
    -   The Altar of Serious Business is where characters killed for the sake of plot advancement in the actual story share a beer with Lancer and complain about their lot in life.

    Film 

-   The Operative in _Serenity_ usually offers one of these. He's not being insincere or mocking when he does this, since he's pretty big on the "honorable death" thing.
    
    "This is a good death. There is no shame in this."
    
-   _Spaceballs_: The computer on Spaceball One at the end of the self-destruct sequence.
    
    **Computer**: Have a nice day!  
    **Skroob, Sanders, and Dark Helmet:** Thank you!
    
-   True to its Gamebook influence, _Black Mirror: Bandersnatch_ features somebody saying a quip about you choosing the wrong action in some of its endings.
    
    **Reporter:** Another Tuckersoft protege, famed programmer Colin Ritman, believes there are important lessons to be learned from \[Stefan\] Butler's unraveling. What would you say to Stefan, if he could hear you?  
    **Colin:** I'd say try again.  
    **Reporter:** But he's in prison.  
    **Colin:** Only in this life.
    

    Literature 

-   The _Choose Your Own Adventure_ books involved you picking different actions for the main character. Many times it ended up in a pithy little blurb about the character's death. (The most annoying thing, of course, was when BOTH actions led to death.)
-   There is only one good ending in all the _Nintendo Adventure Books_. Each title has no problem detailing each of the bad endings, so as a fair warning, you will encounter these. A lot.
-   Likewise, _The Invaders Of Hark_ has a single good ending, but it adds on a points system where each decision can grant you a certain number of points that determine your rank when you reach one of the many _other_ available endings. Not only is the text often snarky about the earlier sticky ends, but the lower possible ranks pour salt in the wound. The earliest death possible requires a series of stupid decisions and grants you the rank of "Tourist".

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "The Happiness Patrol": In the opening, one of the members of the titular organization even drops the name of this trope as they are executing the first killjoy seen on screen.
        
        "Have a _nice_ death!"
        
    -   "Rise of the Cybermen": John Lumic signs off thusly to the President of Great Britain before leaving his Cybermen to kill everyone at (Alternate Universe) Jackie Tyler's birthday party:
        
        "And now, I leave you in their capable hands, goodnight, sir! Goodnight, Mr. President!"
        
    -   "Let's Kill Hitler": The Teselecta's Antibodies have an array of these, all delivered in a robotic monotone.
        
        **Antibody:** Welcome. You are unauthorized. Your death will now be implemented. You will experience a tingling sensation and then death. Remain calm while your life is extracted. Please cooperate in your officially sanctioned termination. It is normal to experience fear during your incineration.
        
    -   The Handbots in "The Girl Who Waited", though they don't actually know the medicine they're trying to inject is lethal to aliens.
        
        "This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed."
        
    -   "Oxygen": AI-controlled spacesuits are being programmed to kill their occupants.
        
        "Please remain calm while your central nervous system is disabled."
        
-   Played with in the _Oishinbo_ episode of _Retro Game Master_, where Arino gets a large number of game overs from seemingly random actions, most notably in a part where he has to prepare a monkfish; each step has many possible actions, and all but one of them ends the game immediately. As many of the bad ends are totally arbitrary, sudden, and humorous, he finds that all these "deaths" are actually part of the game's appeal. He manages to finish the game early, and is made to find the ones he missed as a reward. The staff even prepared passwords at the points just before every game over just so Arino can see them for himself in case there was time for it.
-   Game Show example: _Wipeout_ commentators John Anderson and John Henson remark on every time a contestant wipes out, usually with some kind of a pun connected to either the obstacle that the contestant wiped out on, or the occupation or some personality quirk of the contestant. Oftentimes both. Sometimes Jill Wagner joins in as well.

    Parlor Games 

-   _Mafia_ (aka "Werewolf") involves players being murdered by "mafia" during the "nighttime" phase of the game and being executed by an increasingly hysterical mob of (ostensible) citizens during the "daytime" phase. Usually the narrator comes up with creative ways to describe each player's death.

    Pinball 

-   In _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_, draining the last ball down the outlanes will get the Terminator to say, "_Hasta la vista_, baby."
-   When you drain the ball down the outlanes in _Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure_:
    
    **Colonel Vogel:** And this is how we say "goodbye" in Germany. _\[POW!\]_
    
-   _F-14 Tomcat_ has two variants.
    -   If you drain the ball normally, a Russian jingle plays, ending with General Yagov shouting "HEY!"
    -   Draining your last ball prompts this quote from Yagov himself:
-   In Williams Electronics' _No Fear: Dangerous Sports_, draining down the outlanes prompts Skull to either laugh at you or otherwise taunt your playing skills.
    
    **Skull:** Crash and burn!
    
-   _Cirqus Voltaire_ references the above example. Hitting an obstacle during the Roonie video mode causes a similar message to appear on the display, as if this happened to Roonie.
-   In every _Black Knight_ game, the Black Knight laughs at you if you engage the Magna-Save but fail to save the ball.
-   _Rick and Morty_ has a mode where the player is placed in the role of a child named Roy, guiding his life in positive and/or negative ways by making different colored shots. It concludes by giving his age and cause of death (often comically undignified if you end up losing early on).

    Tabletop Games 

-   One of the big attractions of Tracy Hickman's "Killer Breakfast" events at GenCon, for many attendees, has been seeing all the hilariously-stupid ways he kills off their own and other characters, always accompanied by a snarky one-liner. Also inverted, as new players who replace those killed must come up with a smart-alecky justification for their PCs' own arrival in order to _not_ be bumped off just as amusingly.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Level 30 Psychiatry_, poor Roger Wilco still falls victim to this even when he's not playable.
-   _Homestuck_: In the Pre-Scratch troll's session, the Tumor displays a message rather than a countdown. "BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME."
-   _Square Root of Minus Garfield_ parodies this in "Garfield Quest 1", in which a strip which ends with a surly Garfield kicking Jon segues to a Sierra-style message box.

    Web Original 

-   _Goodbye Strangers_: Each page of _Orgone Trail_ is presented as an ending message from an adventure game, most of which are horrible deaths, although a few of them are nonsensical, such as a death from being disapointed.
-   _Supermarioglitchy4's Super Mario 64 Bloopers_ has "101 Ways for Mario to Die (the right way!)".

    Web Videos 

-   In _Free Apple_, a parody of _King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!_ and Point-and-Click Adventure Games in general, the protagonist is repeatedly fooled by a creepy old man (obviously some nefarious entity in diguise) that pretends to be an ordinary shopkeeper and first gives the protagonist a free apple with a skull on it (resulting in a typical Sierra death), and then a banana, **also** with a skull on it (with the same result).

    Western Animation 

-   This happened all the time in _Celebrity Deathmatch_, often delivered by commentators Johnny Gomez and Nick Diamond. (Suffice to say, it was a weird show.)
