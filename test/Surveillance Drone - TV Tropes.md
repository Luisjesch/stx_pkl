A small (usually basketball sized or smaller) robot whose purpose is to record or transmit an A/V feed. Usually hovers, but other variations exist.

They sometimes overlap with Spy Bots but are more closely related to harmless Attack Drones, likewise, sometimes they are magical instead of technological in nature.

As Sinister Surveillance, many these bots are iconic ways to identify the setting as a dystopia of Big Brother Is Watching.

See also Literal Surveillance Bug and Patrolling Mook. Contrast with Animal Eye Spy. Might be deployed by the, well, Drone Deployer.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The Android Saga of _Dragon Ball Z_ reveals that Red Ribbon Army scientist Dr. Gero has insect-sized robots monitoring the heroes for years, studying their techniques so his Androids would know exactly how to beat them. Another, possibly separate, robot was collecting DNA samples so he could create Cell.
-   In _Ergo Proxy_, Vincent and Pino have escaped Romdeau and are now living in somewhat of a shantytown, with about 15 people in its precinct. Vincent almost has a run-in with one, and after he and Pino settle in, more are sent out. Raul, the newly appointed Director-General of the Citizen Security Bureau is to blame for this.
-   In _Hunter × Hunter_, Musse's Nen ability, Secret Window, functions like this. It takes the form of three small owl-like psychic constructs that follow a target and allows Musse to see and hear everything that the owls can see. One of them requires physical contact with the target but cannot be seen or interacted with by anyone but Musse, though the other two owls' traits are unknown. Secret Window continues to function even after Musse's death too, which has a purpose, as his boss, Benjamin, inherits the owls and can see and hear through them.
-   _Lyrical Nanoha_ has the Wide Area Search spell, which has Raising Heart releasing inconspicuous floating energy orbs that remotely scan areas.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_: Asakura's artifact, the Oculus Corvinus/Raven's Eyes. Six small, flying robots used for spying and information-gathering. Perfect for the School Newspaper Newshound. One chapter came up with a more complicated use for them, involving using a ghost to transmit information from one camera to another, so other people can watch the action without being detected.

    Comic Books 

-   _Astro City_: In the story "Father's Day", Jack-In-The-Box has one in the fight with the Brass Monkey. This is because he's the third Jack-In-The-Box, taking over for his predecessor whose wife is having a child. The camera lets Jack-2 monitor from his basement headquarters and give Jack-3 advice and tactical updates.
-   _Copperhead_: Boo has one he uses to collect all available evidence by digitally mapping crime scenes.
-   _The DCU_:
    -   This is one of the functions of Mister Terrific's T-Spheres.
    -   _Robin_: The villain "Jaeger" uses surveillance drones to track his targets and film his kills. He sells the ensuing snuff films on the black market.
-   _Judge Dredd_: There are a _lot_ of surveillance drones hovering around Mega City One so that the Judges can spy on the people.
-   The Rigellian Recorders from the _Marvel Universe_. In _Hulk: The End_, a Rigellion Recorder leaves behind a floating orb shaped one to watch over Bruce/Hulk as the Last of His Kind on a post-nuclear holocaust Earth.

    Fan Fiction 

-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_: Metallia's troops get such a spell to connect with her crystal ball, so she can evaluate their combat performance, not that they're told that's what it does.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Felix the Cat: The Movie_, the Duke uses floating cubes with spotlights shining out of them as a sort of observation device to support his army of mechanized cylinders.
-   _The Incredibles_: Syndrome uses these on his remote volcanic island hideout.

    Films — Live-Action 

    Literature 

-   One of these (called a "Public Eye") appears near the beginning of _Friday_. It's used by police to detect crimes in progress.
-   In _Heart of Steel_, Shark Reef Isle has a number of these patrolling the island lair of super-villain Alistair Mechanus, variously resembling insects or floating balls.
-   The _Known Space_ short story "Cloak of Anarchy" has the Copseye, which is used to monitor Free Parks. It also has a stunner to knock out those breaking the Parks' sole rule: don't hurt others.
-   _Laszlo Hadron and the Wargod's Tomb_: Mat joins in on part of the novel's events in the form of one of thse, since his physical form is neither mobile nor portable.
-   _The Merchant Princes Series_: In _Empire Games_, the United States of Timeline-2 sends drones to investigate other worlds. Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't. They're very concerned when one timeline, which seems to have a kind-of-20th-century level of technology, reacts in a way which suggests _they know what it is_.
-   In _The Mothballed Spaceship_ by Harry Harrison, the protagonists are trying to get on board a mothballed space battleship that blasts anything that gets too close. They try sending in tiny robots, making them smaller and smaller in an attempt to get past its detectors.
    
    Obsessed by miniaturization, they constructed a flying-eye apparatus no larger than the head of a pin that dragged a threadlike control wire after it that also supplied current for the infinitesimal ion drive. This sparked and sizzled its way to within fifteen kilometers of the _Indestructible_ before the all-seeing sensors detected it and neatly blasted it out of existence with a single shot.
    
-   One appears in the 2005 _Nick Velvet_ story "The Theft of the Empty Paint Can". At the time, drone technology was so new that the editor felt compelled to explain that this was a real item.
-   _Uglies_: Aya has one of these named Moggle that she treats like a pet.
-   _The War Against the Chtorr:_ Various types are used by humanity's armed forces against the invading alien ecosystem.
-   The optic probe device used by the Martians in _The War of the Worlds (1898)_ roughly fills this trope.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Alpha House_, the Watt Brothers only come to meetings on a video receiver and camera mounted on a drone.
-   Season 2 of _American Gods (2017)_ introduces the Greek giant turned God of Sinister Surveillance, Argus. He uses bird-shaped drones (presumably as either a nod to or a mockery of Wednesday's own) among many of his other tools of trade to spy on people. One of them is destroyed by a raven right as it picks up Shadow's whereabouts.
-   Human journalists in _Babylon 5_ regularly use hovering cameras.
-   _Batman (1966)_ features a variant on this trope: a remotely controlled model plane that tracks radio signals to their origin, which would have seemed a _very_ high-tech concept in 1966.
-   _The Book of Boba Fett_: Fennec Shand has a small, repulsor-driven, spherical recon droid stored in the buttstock of her rifle. It slips in and out of Bib Fortuna's palace unnoticed, mapping the entire place, and giving her and Boba a comprehensive layout and guard headcount.
-   _Class of '09_: The AI in 2034 frequently deploys them to gather intelligence against American citizens and better "protect" them against crime. Many however despise them as the tools of a repressive and out of control surveillance state.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "Four to Doomsday" features a device known as the Monopticon, patrolling the corridors of Monarch's massive spaceship.
    -   One of these turns up in "Silence in the Library" as a link to Cal.

-   _The Twilight Zone (1985)_: The episode "To See the Invisible Man" has floating security drones used to watch for people breaking laws.

    Video Games 

-   _Baldur's Gate II_ has a magical one in the form of the Wizard's Eye Spell. It can go anywhere the player can and is invisible, though not invulnerable. Anything that can see through invisibility can kill it.
-   Alien surveillance probes are a recurring threat in _C-12: Final Resistance_, and can raise alarms the moment it catches you on camera. It gets really, really annoying at one section of the first level, where you must deactivate a forcefield, bypass an area with _three_ probes, and reach the other side unnoticed — if one of the probes spots you, it raises an alarm and the forcefield reactivates, forcing you to repeat the entire process all over again.
-   _Command & Conquer_:
    -   The USA has this option in two flavors in _Command & Conquer: Generals_. One is bound to a vehicle and increases sight range while detecting invisible enemies, the other is a General power that makes one circle over a certain area indefinitely, like an infinite Spy Satellite power. The latter is cloaked, the former isn't, and both can be shot down by anything that can target air units (the vehicle-bound kind also dies out if the parent vehicle is destroyed.
    -   _Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3_: The Imperial Burst Drone is a small dragonfly-shaped robot that can detect disguised units, latch onto vehicles to slow them down, or commit suicide to stun vehicles.
-   As you get closer to Cortex's castle in _Crash Bandicoot (1996)_, these start to appear.
-   _Deus Ex_ has an augmentation that allows you to deploy one of these to scout (and it can let off an EMP pulse to sabotage electronic devices). It's considered by most players to be excessively expensive for its utility.
-   _Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project_ has a variation that explodes in close proximity to Duke.
-   In _Fairune 2_, a certain collection entry unlocked on game completion reveals the Blue Temple seagulls as being a type of automated surveillance drone.
-   _Fallout_:
    -   _Fallout 3_ has Eyebot robots that have a defence laser but are usually friendly to the player character.
    -   A RobCo exhibit in _Fallout: New Vegas_ confirms that they can "recognize your face and voice with advanced facial and auditory recognition technology". Some Eyebots in _Fallout 3_ can call in reinforcements after a certain stage in the game and a random encounter shows two wastelanders discussing whether or not its spying on them whilst it hovers in between the pair.
    -   In _New Vegas_, your companion Arcade Ganon (who is actually a refugee from the now defunct Enclave and would probably know better) expresses a distrust of your Robot Buddy ED-E, who is a Super Prototype for a model of Eyebot that never was produced, specifically because it may be surveiling him.
-   In _Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter_, the player can use a Sikorsky Cypher UAV to scan hostile areas.
-   _Half-Life 2_: City Scanners hover right in your face and take a snapshot of you, which creates a blinding flash. Destroying them may net you a battery, which charges up your suit a little bit. The Synth version, the Shield Scanner, gives your position away to Striders with each photo and can sometimes appear with Hopper mines in tow.
-   _Halo_: The UNSC has a variety of small autonomous surveillance drones. The beginning of _Halo 2_ even shows camera drones present at a military award ceremony. The Covenant also have their own version, known as "Eyes".
-   In _Heroes of the Storm_, the _Scouting Drone_ talent and its variants are used to reveal an area for several seconds, exposing stealthed enemies in its radius.
-   Scan-Balls in _Hidden Deep_ are softball-sized hover drones the scout class characters have as standard equipment. They're intended to recon potentially dangerous terrain ahead of you, so you don't have to explore in person and potentially lose a man. They also have a magnet to grab and carry items and can push switches, and push comes to shove, an elecric zapper to fry any hostile lifeforms, but at the cost of eating through its already preciously short battery life.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_ has the Sentrobes, which are flying security cameras with a short-range projectile launcher and the ability to launch self-propelled bombs with a timed fuse.

-   The CYPHER drones in _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_ are cameras with a hover fan. They'll sound the alarm if you're spotted by one, but they don't attack on their own.

-   _PAYDAY 2_: The Murky Station level has drones that act as flying security cameras.

-   _Project Eden_ has two kinds of deployable drone, a hovering ball with a limited battery life and a tracked rover with a small energy weapon. Both can press buttons.
-   _\[PROTOTYPE\]_: Drones are able to detect Alex and deploy a reaction squad.
-   _Rage (2011)_ has Authority Drones, which are designed to scout ahead and look for Ark survivors. Their usefulness is debatable, as despite having several in the players face over the course of the game the Authority never seem to collect a picture of you.
-   _Rebel Inc._ has UAV deployment as support from the Coalition, that act as Defog of War. They are particularly useful to locate Insurgent training camps, so that an Airstrike can wipe them out.
-   The _Sonic the Hedgehog_ series has Gun Beetles. While most of them have some type of weapon, the Mono Beetles do not, and thus function as this.
-   _StarCraft_: Observers are permanently cloaked flying robots that can detect other cloaked units.
-   _Super Mario Bros._: The hover-cam is operated by the cloud-riding Lakitu's, controlling said camera with a fishing pole, odd but close enough.

-   Ogre Magi in _Warcraft II_ and Warlocks in _World of Warcraft_ have access to a spell, the Eye of Kilrogg, that is essentially a magical version of a surveillance drone (which takes the shape of a big green, disembodied floating eye).
-   Grineer data vaults in _Warframe_ are guarded by sensor regulators, balloon drones that will trip the alarm the moment an intruder gets into their cone of view, conveniently depicted as four lines jutting out from its camera. Don't think about trying to destroy them, as they will also trip the alarm if they survive the damage, unless you've already gathered the data.
-   _Worms WMD_ features the Mischievous Drone, which flies for several seconds after it's launched in order to scout inside buildings and collect crates for you. An upgraded version that additionally creates a magnetic field can be crafted.
-   _X_:
    -   In _X: Beyond the Frontier_, the Xperimental Shuttle is equipped with a camera drone that is basically an excuse for the devs to have a free-flying external view.
    -   _X3: Reunion_ features the tiny Camera Drone (about twice the size of a space suit) which is used in several missions but is otherwise unavailable for use. The Motion Analysis Relay System script package in _X3: Terran Conflict_ and _Albion Prelude_ in allows the fighter drone to coordinate as "Goblins", which can function as a surveillance net, by towing surveillance satellites around the controlling ship, or remotely deploy satellites far away for exploration or target spotting for the missile frigates
    -   _X: Rebirth_ has the Beholder ROV, a tiny drone that can be deployed from the _Albion Skunk_. It's used to scan ships and stations for potential deals, but most players use them for exploring the detailed stations.

    Webcomics 

-   The Tic-Tocs (robot birds) from _Gunnerkrigg Court_, apparently, though who exactly they're working for is a mystery to the Court and the Forest both. It's eventually revealed that they were built by Kat, as part of a Stable Time Loop to save Annie from her fall off the bridge in one of the earliest chapters.
-   _A Miracle of Science_ has robot cameras on dynamic balancing platforms.

    Western Animation 

-   The press uses these in _Batman Beyond_.
-   _Detentionaire_ has eyebots for a school, of all things.

-   _Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)_ features such "spy orbs" utilized by Robotnik to monitor his city.
-   The Autobots' Sky Spy from _Transformers: Generation 1_ is a long-range satellite version of this.

    Real Life 

-   The main functional difference of the real-life examples compared to fictional ones is that real-life drones tend to be much louder.
-   Micro Air Vehicles are being designed for the army.
-   There was, for a time, a plan to develop softball-sized robots of this type for use on the International Space Station. They would be capable of moving about on their own by using ducted fans to produce thrust. Since the ISS is in a microgravity environment, they would effectively be capable of flying around the station in adherence to the spirit of the trope. Likely served as the inspiration for the SGU Kinos mentioned above.
-   The Air Hogs Hawk-eye is the civilian version, you can even post your findings online.
-   The AR Drone from Parrot has the same capabilities and carries both nose and belly cameras.
    -   It spawned an entire family of small helicopter drones (factory- or enthusiast-built) driven by an iPhone or Android device.
