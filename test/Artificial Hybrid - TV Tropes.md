"Lions and boars and lion-boars, oh my!"

Most Half Human Hybrids are created when members of two different species conceive a child together, or by descendants thereof. This trope applies to characters who at birth are fully one species (usually human), but somewhere down the road are turned (deliberately or by accident) into a hybrid between their original species and another one. May or may not occur through magical or scientific means, but in case the subject will often receive Hybrid Power as a direct result.

May overlap with Bio-Augmentation. May occur through Fusion Dance or as part of a Hybridization Plot.

Compare Our Werebeasts Are Different, Monstrous Humanoid, Mix-and-Match Man, Mix-and-Match Critters, Flesh Golem, and Frankenstein's Monster when the "hybrid" part is more physically blatant.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Michiru and Nazuna from _BNA: Brand New Animal_ were originally ordinary humans, but became beastmen in their teenage years after accidentally being infused with beastman blood.
-   The warrioresses in _Claymore_ are created by grafting yoma tissue into human women. They are half human and half a yoma. And they are trained to kill pure yoma because they eat human guts.
-   _Chainsaw Man_:
    -   Some humans' Deal with the Devil, including the title character, involves them merging with their contracted devil for Powers via Possession.
    -   Although fiends are devils Possessing a Dead Body, the merger's permanence effectively makes them a different type of hybrid where the devil is in total control.
-   Devilmen of _Devilman_ are humans who fuse with teleporting demons. Some, like protagonist Akira, can switch between human and demon forms at will, but others are stuck with hybrid forms.
-   _Digimon Data Squad_: The Bio-Hybrids are humans that have been artificially infused with Digimon DNA by the Big Bad. This lets them turn into the Digimon whose DNA was infused into them, and gives them superhuman abilities in their human form.
-   Several characters in _Dorohedoro_ are humans who have been partially transmuted by mages wanting to 'experiment', often giving them animal body parts as a result. The Hero of the story, Kaiman, is one such person and has a lizard head on top of an otherwise human body. Killing the mage responsible reverts the transformation, so Kaiman is hunting down the one who transformed him to get his original head back. To his benefit, being under the effect of transformative magic makes him immune to any further attempts to transform him.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist_ chimeras are produced by transmuting two individuals of different species together. Human chimeras are heavily illegal, which naturally meant that Father's cabal within the government created several of them as Super Soldiers.
-   While most hanyou are born in _Inuyasha_ as a child of a human and a youkai, there are also those who were once human. They offered a pact to the lower youkai. Their soul in exchange for a demonic body. Naraku was born this way, but the anime also shows two other unnaturally-created hanyou, namely Sara Asano and Tsubaki.
-   _Kill la Kill_: Ryuko Matoi was born human, but Ragyo's experiment turned her into a human/Life Fiber hybrid.
-   _One Piece_: The Zoan Devil Fruits let their eaters turn into hybrids of their original species and the species that the specific Devil Fruit gives. Chopper is a reindeer that ate the Human-Human Fruit and thus can turn partly humanoid, while Lucci is a human that ate the Cat-Cat Fruit. A later arc eventually introduces artificial Zoan fruits called SMILE. Eating one is like taking a lottery where the least horrible side effects are gaining useful partial transformations into an animal.
-   Shinichi and Migi from _Parasyte_ merge more and more until they are a mix of human and parasite.
-   Ken Kaneki from _Tokyo Ghoul_ was a normal human being. After an accident that almost killed him, he is given organs from a ghoul and becomes a human-ghoul hybrid in the process.

    Card Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_:

    Comic Books 

-   _Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)_: Carol Danvers, the current Captain Marvel, was born a human woman, but her DNA was altered in a way that turned her into a Kree/human hybrid. However, this was later retconned so that her mother was a Kree, making her a more traditional Half-Human Hybrid.
-   _Dick Tracy_: The new Moon Maid was originally Glenna Ermine, the daughter of villain Poise Ermine. She won second place in a look-alike contest for the original, long deceased Moon Maid, and subsequently was kidnapped, had the original Moon Maid's DNA superimposed over her own, had facial surgery, and was given the original Moon Maid's memories. The scientists involved were using her as part of a plot to steal Diet Smith's Space Coupe. She was offered to restore her original appearance, but she declined — considering what<small>◊</small> she used to look like, it's probably for the best.
-   In _Dog Man (Dav Pilkey)_, a human police officer and his dog partner are somehow merged into one being to save their lives when they were both injured in an explosion.
-   _Giantkiller_: Jill was near-fatally shot by Richard Gray Brigstine while trying to arrest him and his cult. She was found and taken to Steven Azuma who augmented her using a Daikaiju DNA sample he had found. Jill becomes the first human-Daikaiju hybrid, granting her super strength, speed and the ability to walk through Daikaiju territory without dying.
-   _Morbius_: Michael Morbius accidentally turns himself into a human-bat hybrid while trying to cure his blood disease.
-   In _Runaways_, Victor Mancha is a cyborg created by Ultron. As he grows up, his body is designed to gradually become more organic, so that by the time he becomes an adult, he will be indistinguishable from a mutant and thus easily infiltrate the Avengers in order to betray them.
-   _Spider-Man_: Downplayed with Peter Parker. While he's still considered human after the spider bite which gave him his powers, his genetic code has a very small percentage of spider DNA. The same applies to most other spider-people.
-   Miguel O'Hara, a.k.a. _Spider-Man 2099_, has 50% spider DNA (though he still looks thoroughly human beyond having claws and fangs and Running on All Fours) after the Freak Lab Accident which gave him his powers.
-   In _Transmetropolitan_, "temping" technology allows people to give themselves animal traits on a temporary basis, while the Transient subculture use similar technology to gradually transform themselves into The Greys. Unfortunately the alien physiology doesn't mesh particularly well with human and no Transient has ever completed the change, so most wind up as some chimera stuck between the two species.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Godzilla_ fanfiction _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_, San's Not Quite Dead decapitated head transforms an Only Mostly Dead Vivienne Graham into a hybrid Kaiju while Brain Uploading San's consciousness to the hybrid's extra head. It's confirmed in Chapter 7 before the hybrid's second metamorphosis that it possesses two sets of DNA from either half.
-   In the _RWBY_ AU fic _My Abominable Monster Classmates Can't Be This Cute!_, Salem runs a secret Academy of Evil in the Grimmlands, with a student body consisting of teenagers whom she kidnapped and turned into humanoid Grimm hybrids like herself using the God of Darkness's Grimm-spawning pools. RWBY themselves are among the hybrids. Weiss is considered the most physiologically-perfect of all the hybrids short of Salem, because she's the only one who came out of the transformation with her entire body intact and didn't need any transplants. Blake, on the other end of the scale, is a lot more monstrous and deranged than the other hybrids, and she can't use her aura without descending into temporary insanity because her aura was already unlocked before she was turned.
-   In the _Zootopia_ AU _Ouroboros: The Endless Cycle_, Judy becomes part fox after she is bitten by a venomous chimera and Nick saves her by transmuting the bitten arm and a few of her internal organs into copies of his own.
-   _Sharing the Night_: In the climax, as a result of having accidentally absorbed Discord's dragonfire when merging with the Seed of Harmony and splitting into two versions of herself, the two new Celestias end up being part dragon. They have a number of outwardly draconic traits such as sharp teeth and forked tongues, and their magic becomes supernaturally attractive to full dragons.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Bite_ has a particularly vomit-inducing example, where a bite from an insect causes the protagonist to undergo a slow and stomach-churning transformation, becoming a part-insect Monstrous Humanoid before her death. The eggs she lays spawn an insect swarm, which it is implied will have the same effect on humans they bite and cause her fate to become The Virus.
-   _Captain Marvel (2019)_ stays true to Carol's original backstory with her being a human who became part Kree hybrid via a blood transfusion.
-   _District 9_: Early durring his Slow Metamorphosis, Wikus's DNA is stated to be in perfect balance between human and alien. It's only for a very short amount of time though, because the alien DNA is quickly taking over the human.
-   In _The Fly (1986)_, intoxicated scientist Seth Brundle tests himself in his experimental teleportation pods, unaware that a common housefly had entered the chamber with him; as the simple computer cannot teleport both entities as separate, Seth and the fly are fused at the genetic level. Despite experiencing some initial benefits (which he incorrectly believes is the result of the teleportation procedure) like an enhanced sex drive and increased strength, he slowly begins to transform into a diseased mutant and his sanity and health deteriorate. In the finale he transforms into a terrifying insectoid man, the "Brundlefly" and tries to fuse with his girlfriend and unborn child as a last-ditch effort to regain his humanity and save himself.

    Literature 

-   Nnedi Okorafor's _Binti_: The Starfish Alien Meduse genetically engineer some of their traits into the title character so she can communicate with them (including through their Hive Mind). This gives her tentacular Alien Hair and some of the Meduse's emotions, the latter of which cause her some difficulty since they're much more prone to anger than she.
-   The work of the owner of _Dr. Franklin's Island_ is splicing human genes into animals. He's got a little zoo of things like piglets with human hands, bats with human legs, parrots with floppy excess flesh and so on, and is more than happy to move on to human trials after a plane crashes off the coast of his island. Semi and Miranda are each implanted with DNA from multiple species of fish and bird respectively and transform more smoothly and completely than the zoo animals.
-   _Maddrax_: The first mendrites in this German SF series were created artificially, hybrids of humans and hydrites. The mendrites seen later in the plot have been naturally born.
-   In "Segregationist", robots (Metallos) have been legally recognized as people and humans have begun getting replacement parts that are metallic in origin. The med-eng points out that the inverse is also happening; that Metallos are requesting fibrous/organic replacements where possible. The titular surgeon opposes such mongrelization.
    
    _"There is nothing wrong with a Metallo as a Metallo. As you say, they are citizens. But you're not a Metallo. You're a human being. Why not stay a human being?"_
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Babylon 5_: At the end of the first season, Minbari Ambassador Delenn uses a mysterious biotechnological device to enter a cocoon. At the beginning of the next season, she emerges from it to reveal that she's turned herself into a Minbari/Human hybrid, to be a living bridge between the species. Later on, Jeffrey Sinclair goes back in time and uses the same device to also become a hybrid, taking the name Valen, becoming the great Minbari spiritual leader of old. He is also Delenn's ancestor, possibly explaining why she can use the device.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   The fourth season has Adam; a mix of humans, machines, and demons, who was assembled in an underground secret lab.
    -   _Angel_ shows Cordelia, who magically becomes a half-demon. As a result, she has powerful, magical powers, unlike the naturally born half-demons, but no Super-Strength.
-   _Doctor Who_: In "Journey's End", a "biological metacrisis" turns Donna Noble half-Time Lord and also creates a half-human clone of the Doctor. Unfortunately for the new Artificial Hybrid, Donna's brain is still human enough that she can't handle the entirety of the Doctor's knowledge being copied into it, so he has to wipe her memories of him to save her life, although she is still a hybrid.
-   In _Earth: Final Conflict_, Humans could become Atavus hybrids by being placed in a regeneration chamber with an Atavus.
-   Played with in _Star Trek: Voyager_. At first it seems as though Seska is a Bajoran (an alien species) but then the doctor finds out that her DNA resembles that of a Cardassian (another alien species). She claims that she had a disease as a kid and got a blood transfusion from a Cardassian, but it turns out that she's lying and is fully Cardassian.
-   The supersoldiers in _The X-Files_ have been artificially created. Before, they were ordinary humans.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Bio-Monster DNA, a half-man, half-spider resulting from a sex change operation gone wrong. More readily apparent, a product of FMW's "Sports Entertainment" phase.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ has had numerous examples over the years:
    -   Owlbears and Bulettes are both monsters that are famously created by wizards, mixing bears and giant owls in the case of the former and armadillos and snapping turtles in the case of the latter.
    -   Many Half-(Whatever) templates in 3rd Edtion were the result of this, like the Half-Elemental.
    -   _The Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica_ has the Simic Hybrid as a new player character race. They started out as ordinary humans, elves, or vedalken that the Simic Combine experimented on (allegedly with consent of the subject; allegedly). The experimentation gives them abilities like being able to breathe underwater, Combat Tentacles, or even spit acid.
    -   Typically, driders — drow/spider centaurs — start out as simply dark elves, before having their legs replaced with a spider's torso.
-   _Pathfinder_:
    -   Driders, like their _D&D_ progenitors, begin life as dark elves before being turned into elf/spider hybrids. Similarly, oronci are orcs who were transformed into orc/centipede chimeras.
    -   Areelu Vorlesh, the creator of the Worldwound, began life as a regular human witch but was transformed into a half-succubus through her service to the demons of the Abyss.
    -   An obscure four-part ritual slowly transforms an exceptionally evil mortal into a demon. The text notes that many people stop after the second-last step grants them the powerful Half-Fiend template.

    Video Games 

-   Kraka-Tur from _Arcanum_ is a former human who mutated himself into a Draconic Humanoid by killing Bellerogrim, the last dragon, and using his blood in a magic ritual.
-   _Elsword_: Ciel, normally a human, becomes a half-demon after forming a soul-contract with the demoness Lu.
-   _Heroes of Might and Magic Ashan_: The wizards of the Silver Cities have conducted experiments into the creation of new species by experimenting on human criminals. Some of these received blood transfusions from demons, mutating them into orcs, goblins, centaurs and cyclopses, while others were spliced with the body-parts of mundane animals and became the beast-men races.
-   _Honkai Impact 3rd_: the game has various cases of artificial hybrids between human and "Honkai Beasts", which give them extra strength.
    -   In the present time, Theresa Apocalypse is an Artificial Human made by splicing the genes of a legendary Valkyrie, Kallen Kaslana, with that of an Emperor-class Honkai Beast, codenamed "Vishnu". This gives her super strength and Healing Factor, as well as natural resistance to the Honkai's influence. Later, the story introduces Olenyeva Twins, who had Honkai Beast cells grafted onto their bodies when they were younger; they have more outward physical traits of Honkai Beasts than Theresa.
    -   In the distant past, there existed "Fusion Warriors", frontline Honkai fighters who are infused with Honkai Beast genomes, greatly empowering them and giving them resistance to the Honkai. The legendary hero, Kevin Kaslana, was one such case; later, the Kaslana bloodline is said to have inherited the potential strength from such hybrid, but only a few have "unlocked" its full potential, such as Siegfried Kaslana.
-   Samus from the _Metroid_ series was spliced with Chozo DNA (specified in the manga to have been from Grey Voice, one of her adoptive fathers) as a child so that she could better survive on the planet Zebes. During the opening of _Metroid Fusion_, she also gets injected with Metroid DNA to help her fight off an infection from the X Parasites. Exactly what percentage of her is still human is never specified.
-   _Shin Megami Tensei_ is full of these.
    -   Many humans throughout the franchise have underwent a Fusion Dance with a demon, from the Chaos Hero of _Shin Megami Tensei I_ to the Demonoid population of Infernal Tokyo in _Shin Megami Tensei IV_.
    -   The Demi-Fiend, hero of _Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne_, was an ordinary human transformed into a Fiend by Lucifer, by having a Magatama forcible ingested.
-   _StarCraft II_: This is why the Tal'darim willingly serve the Big Bad Amon, as they want him to reshape their bodies into the monstrous(ly powerful) Zerg-Protoss hybrids. Once they learn that this is impossible and all hybrids have to be made from scratch, they defect and join you as the Token Evil Teammate.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Champions of Far'aus_, Mr.X uses spirit melding, a process used to combine different spirits together into more powerful ones, to create his 'experiments'. Said experiments include not only spirits, but objects, animals, and people, which Karla notes _should_ be impossible.
-   _Isla Aukate_:
    -   The Darnathi use a process called "prototyping" to hybridize their colony missions with the planet's native lifeforms, both to adapt to the microbiome and to blend in. For most Darnathi on Earth that means they went from lizard-like amphibians to Human Aliens, though Sagitar and some of the second fleet used the genomes of Aukate's anthropomorphic animals after landing there.
    -   Rain, Darius' adopted pegasus daughter, went through prototyping to make her bipedal and improve her forehooves' dexterity, making her 10% Darnathi (from Darius) in the process.

    Web Original

    Western Animation 

-   _Ben 10: Omniverse_ has the Rooters, a rogue Black Op Plumber branch consisting of former humans who became half-alien from experimenting on Kevin when he was in the Null Void. The Half-Human Hybrid aliens Helen, Manny, Alan, and Pierce from _Ben 10: Alien Force_ are also apparently this, as they were normal humans experimented on by the Rooters and given Fake Memories to make them think they were natural-born hybrids.
-   Both _Danny Phantom_ and his Arch-Enemy Vlad Plasmius were born human until they were each in accidents that transformed them into Human/Ghost hybrids.
-   _Inside Job (2021)_: Glenn Dolphman initially started out as a human, but turned himself into a human/dolphin hybrid as part of a Super Soldier project.
-   The title characters of _Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ eventually discover the Ooze didn't randomly mutate them into humanoids. Baron Draxum used it to combine their DNA with the mightiest human warrior he could find (Lou Jitsu, who later became Master Splinter).
-   _The Legend of Korra_; the Avatar was created when Wan, a human, merged with the Spirit of Light and Life Raava during Harmonic Convergence, a period of heightened spiritual activity when Raava is supposed to battle her Evil Counterpart Vaatu. Ten thousand years later, Unaloq repeats the process with Vaatu, turning himself into a Dark Avatar to counter the original.
-   In the last season of _Trollhunters_, Jim realizes he cannot win the day in his human form, and reluctantly agrees to undergo a process that will turn him into a human/troll hybrid. At first he enjoys his newfound strength and durability, but then suffers a Heroic Breakdown once he realizes he can't walk in the sun and must effectively abandon his human life forever.
