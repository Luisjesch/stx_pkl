The arch-Nature Spirit of Earth... or whatever planet is the story's setting. May or may not have a humanoid form (substitute "humanoid" with whatever species equivalent in non-terrestrial settings), but if it is, it's Always Female due to Mother Nature, Father Science. Tends to dress in a Garden Garment and leave a trail of flowers where their Fertile Feet tread, specially if Nature Equals Plants is in effect.

Of course, if you actually look at old cultures Mother Nature tends to occur mainly in fertile places, and infertile parts of the world often had male Earth deities. Egypt had Geb, for instance, and the Norse had Ymir and Freyja.

Often a _bona fide_ Physical God, if not outright one of the Powers That Be. Actually pissing her off is likely to result in Gaia's Vengeance (also compare Nature Is Not a Toy), while making her sad can result in Gaia's Lament. If she also created the world, she overlaps with Mother Goddess; if she is merely human but with a gift for gardening and horticulture, an Earth Mother.

When Mother Nature _isn't_ exactly the ideal mother, see Nature Is Not Nice. See also Water Is Womanly. Some Pastoral Science Fiction may use this trope.

    Comic Books 

-   _Arawn_: After everything is over, Siahm goes to live in the forest where she is protected from Arawn's wrath by the goddess of nature, fertility, and women. She also resurrects Kern as a forest god each time Arawn tries to kill him in revenge.
-   _The Heap_: A later retcon of the Heap's origin is that as he was lying in the swamp, mortally wounded but refusing to die, the goddess Ceres came to his aid, and decided to save him from death by transforming him into her champion against evil. Later retellings change Ceres into the more generic Mother Nature.
-   _Judge Dredd_: Gender Flipped; a mutant named Father Earth (who appears to be equal parts plant and human) leads an attack against Mega-City One to enact Gaia's Vengeance upon it. He ends up hypnotized and eaten by a giant carnivorous plant.

-   _Shaman's Tears_: Joshua Brand is empowered by Wakan Takan; the "Great Spirit" of the Sioux. It usually manifests as sexy Native American woman.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: This trope was implied in canon in regards to Mothra, and in this fic it gets more explicit confirmation. Mothra's POV describes her as being the mother to all life on Earth, with an otherworldly awareness of the processes of life, death and Reincarnation. She considers the Many as an Undead Abomination of Ghidorah's making to be an utter blasphemy to nature which she will not tolerate absorbing her children into a Fate Worse than Death.
-   _Blood and Revolution_ has a genderflpped version: the "earthkami" — Anthropomorphic Personification of the Earth itself — is Darien Shields (Prince Endymion) from Sailor Moon. He's explicitly refered to as the Egyptian Geb as well, and implied to be all earth gods/goddesses from human mythologies.
-   _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_: Mother Nature is basically the same as the cartoon show version, though her name is now invoked in prayers by the Smurfs for blessings and such. Just don't ask her what she does about gay people. Her Mirror Universe counterpart, though, is more of a sex goddess that its Smurfs honor with prayers for doing whatever it is they want to do, and with whomever they want.
-   _Mythology 101 Cycle_: Terra, the Mother Goddess, who is the Ethical Slut version.
-   _Pony POV Series_: The title belongs to Princess Gaia, Fluttershy's future alicorn self. Mother Deer has been keeping stewardship of one of her duties till Gaia is around to cover it.
-   _Return of the Guardians_: Empress Natellusia or Lusie looks like an Ambiguously Brown little girl with an Unlimited Wardrobe of immaculate white clothes, and her only power is to communicate with all forms of life, but since the Earth _wants_ to do Lusie's bidding, the kid commands plant life, animals, weather and Ether, the sparkly building blocks of creation. Like Mother Nature in Joyce's original books, she is also Pitch Black's long-lost daughter.
-   _Waiting for Rain -- Kida & Pocahontas_ is a fanvid where Kida is a Physical God and the embodiment of nature. Pocahontas meets her and befriends her, but Kida ends up kidnapped by colonizers.

-   _The Year Without a Santa Claus_: Mother Nature is the mother of the Miser Brothers (Snow Miser and Heat Miser), the two beings who control the Earth's temperatures and weather. While she's described as The Dreaded, she's revealed to be a pleasant, grandmotherly Reasonable Authority Figure... though the fact that she can scare both of her sons into listening to her probably makes her reputation warranted.

    Literature 

-   _Brother Eagle, Sister Sky_: His grandmother taught Seattle that the earth is the mother of humanity, that what befalls her will also befall her children and that these lessons must be passed down from generation to generation.
-   _Dora Wilk Series_: The Goddess is apparently connected to Earth and is worshiped as the supreme deity of magicals (even though they have many, many, _many_ lesser gods). It's apparently a counterbalance of heaven and hell's more mystical God, although the two seem to be on good terms.
-   _The Dresden Files_: The are two characters that fulfill this role: Queen Mother Summer and Queen Mother Winter. They are the oldest and strongest fairies of their courts. Each has ultimate domain over her domain but generally remain neutral to any scuffle their daughters Queen Titania of Summer and Queen Mab of Winter or the lower fae start.
-   _Drinking Midnight Wine_: The character of Gale, AKA Gaia, turns out to be the Anthropomorphic Personification of nature and earth.

-   _Malazan Book of the Fallen_: The Sleeping Goddess Burn is very literally the world the characters walk on and referred to as the "Mother Goddess".

-   _The Silmarillion_: Yavanna, the Vala charged with guarding the living things of the earth and the creator of animals and plants. She was responsible for the creation of the Ents, having petitioned Eru for their inclusion into the world to protect the forests from the depredations of humans, dwarves and orcs.
-   _The Stormlight Archive_: Cultivation, one of the sixteen Shards of Adonalsium, fits quite well with this trope. The spren call her "Mother," as do the few humans who get a chance to meet her. While she spends most of her time hiding in her sacred valley and watching over the plants there, she does occasionally affect the rest of the world. In _Oathbringer_, it is revealed that she gave Dalinar his boon (instead of her daughter the Nightwatcher), which ultimately led to Dalinar growing into a person strong enough to resist Odium.
    
    **Cultivation:** I control all things that can be grown, nurtured. That includes the thorns.
    
-   _Survivor Dogs_: Dogs and wolves believe in the Earth-Dog, a giant black-furred and mastiff-like dog that lives in the earth.

Dogs often bury their prey as offerings to her.

-   _The Traitor Son Cycle_: The Wild creatures and the Outwallers, as well as some of the hillmen, worship goddess Tara, the personification of nature and the Wild. In truth, Tar is a dragoness, who, while gifted with some Green Thumb powers, isn't really Mother Earth.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Mother Nature_: Mother Nature narrates the footage of wild animals while a young boy asks her questions.
-   _Power Rangers Turbo_ has an episode featuring a male version known as Erutan.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   The "mother (earth) goddess" figures in many Real Life religions and mythologies, many of which are Older Than Dirt, are the Trope Maker.
-   Mesopotamian Mythology has a few of these, and they probably constitute the oldest known examples of this trope in history.
    -   The consort of Anu, the supreme god of the pantheon, is explicitly an earth goddess, though the name differs depending on the place (she's called Uras or Ki in Sumerian, and Antu in Akkadian). Unlike her husband, she is mentioned very little in surviving writings, and some doubt that she was ever worshipped.
    -   Ninhursag is a more prominent example, being a mother goddess who symbolizes mountains and fertility of living things, including humankind. All Sumerian kings were said to be "nourished by Ninhursag's milk".
-   Classical Mythology: Gaia, the mother of the Titans and Greek gods. Decidedly more of the vengeful persuasion, though usually it's because some god or titan gave her cause first.
-   Egyptian Mythology: Gender flipped with Geb the Earth Father and Nut the Sky Mother.
-   _Poetic Edda_: Gerðr, a giantess courted by Frey with the aid of Skirnir. The story is part of a fertility ritual in which Gerðr represents Earth, Frey fertility, and Skirnir sunlight.
-   Taíno Mythology: Atabey is the goddess of fresh water and fertility, who also represents the spirit of earth.
-   Prithvi is the goddess of earth in the Vedic religion, the consort of Dyaus Pita, the god of sky. In Hinduism (which developed out of the Vedic religion), she is known as Bhumi, the divine mother of Sita.
-   Mat Zemlya, the earth goddess in Slavic Mythology.
-   Žemyna from Lithuanian mythology mixes the Mother Earth aspect with The Grim Reaper, as she is also the keeper of dead souls. Her Latvian counterpart, Māra, is regarded the same way.
-   _Scythian Mythology_: Api, goddess of the Earth and water, whom the Scythians depicted as having plant feet. She also represented birthing and fertility more broadly. Myths held that she gave birth to all the very first living things. Api remained aloof and indifferent after this however, much like nature is often viewed as being.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Pathfinder_: The Green Mother is a particularly dark take on this concept. She's a beautiful Plant Person closely tied to the natural world and plant life specifically — but she embodies the darker, more primal aspects of nature, especially ones pertaining to lust, allure and death, such as the urge calling salmon to spawn and die or the mantis' drive to consume her mate.

    Video Games 

-   _Albion_: Animebona is the spirit of the eponymous planet, and the entity representing magic in Dji-Kantos philosophy.

-   _Endless Legend_: Auriga is the narrator and planetary setting of the game. She simultaneously sees hope and despair in the life and civilizations dwelling on her, because she knows she is slowly dying, turning into an icy wasteland.

Unfortunately, she and the other inhabitants of Ymir were no match for Hel, the ruler of the realm of the dead, and now she only lives as a spirit inside of her remaining descendant, Eir.

-   _Horizon Zero Dawn_: Invoked by the head of the Zero Dawn project, Elizabet Sobek. In order to save the world from a Robot Uprising or rather, re-create the biosphere from scratch after the unstoppable Faro Plague finished consuming everything bigger than a bacteria, she built GAIA, an artificial intelligence with a love for living things and the infrastructure needed to manage the ecosystem on a global scale. She even designed GAIA's holographic avatar to fit this trope, presenting as an African woman in a toga.

-   _Mortal Kombat 11_: Cetrion is an Elder Goddess who commands the four classical elements of nature. She has green hair resembling seaweed and wears a dress made of green teal and plant matter.
-   _Overlord_: The Mother Goddess is the deity of the Elves and a nature goddess of sorts as well as a standard Goddess of Good. Her priestesses gorge themselves to shape themselves in her image.
-   _Pajama Sam_: Mother Nature is the president of World Wide Weather.
-   _Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey_ has Mem Aleph the mother of everything that has existed on earth. Including the human soul and the demons/old gods. She unleashes the Schwarzwelt upon the earth because man has polluted the earth so badly that in order to save it she will wipe out mankind like she did the sentient lifeforms and civilizations that existed before humanity.
-   _A Very Long Rope to the Top of the Sky_: The Lydian religion has God with _two_ children; one of them, "the Mother", gave birth to the world, while the other, "The Eater", was a lazy hedonist who only devoured his sister's creations.
