This trope is for any situation where a character (usually but not always The Protagonist) is placed in a Love Triangle situation where he or she must choose between rival suitors where one of the suitors has Magic and Powers, is non-human, or has some other property that places them firmly in the category of Speculative Fiction, and the other suitor is an ordinary person. Of course, the "magic" option need not use something called magic. In a Science Fiction setting, aliens, time travelers, visitors from another dimension or planet, or similar such characters qualify. In a Super Hero setting, anyone with superpowers would qualify.

When the character making the choices is a Muggle, such cases generally represent more than just a choice between persons, but often a Red Pill, Blue Pill kind of choice between living a normal life and living one that is exciting and exotic, but unfamiliar and often dangerous. Generally speaking, you can expect the character to go with the exotic Love Interest, because that is what allows for a more interesting storyline. However, sometimes it will be treated much the same way as a Rich Suitor, Poor Suitor plot, with the muggle picking an ordinary life of simple love over all the exotic things the non-muggle can offer them.

Sometimes the Magical option will have distinct disadvantages. We all know power comes at a price, and certain limitations may make it difficult for the protagonist to honestly desire a life with them. Maybe they can't be away from water. Maybe they have no physical presence, or have debilitating effects on those around them. Maybe the protagonist just finds the fact that they're not quite human unsettling. Whatever the issue, it makes the expression of love and lasting commitment a problem. The Muggle, on the other hand, is presumably a lovely person but with no such paranormal limitations. Suddenly they look a lot more enticing.

If the character making the choice is a non-muggle, one can almost invariably expect them to marry the Muggle, often in the face of resistance, prejudice and even taboos and prohibitions from their community of fellow fantastic beings.

By default, it involves Muggle–Mage Romance.

Compare to Betty and Veronica and Rich Suitor, Poor Suitor. Sometimes overlaps with Loves My Alter Ego and Two-Person Love Triangle; themselves subtropes of the Secret Identity.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Eternals_: Sersi the Eternal has two love interests: her lover for millennia, Ikaris, is an Eternal like herself, while her current boyfriend, Dane, who is human, is the muggle. At the end, the muggle wins via Death of the Hypotenuse, though he's hinted to be more magical than he lets on.

    Literature 

-   _Air Awakens_: Basically every triangle a fledgling sorcerer Vhalla is involved in, and there are quite a few: Vhalla, Prince Aldrik (sorcerer), Prince Baldair (warrior). Vhalla, Prince Aldrik, Sareem (library apprentice). Vhalla, Sareem, Roan (another library apprentice, in love with Sareem).
-   The protagonist of _Blood and Chocolate (1997)_, a werewolf named Vivian, has this when she is forced to choose between the werewolf Gabriel and the human Aiden. However, the book and the film treat this situation very differently. In The Film of the Book, Gabriel is the Big Bad and his attraction and relationship to Vivian is surface-level possessiveness at best, while Adrien connects with her struggles on a deeper level. In the end, Vivian manages to break free of her pack's strict anti-interspecies-relationship rule and run away with Aiden. In the original novel, Gabriel has been in love with Vivian from the start, but she refuses him because she assumes that he is nothing more than a brute, and she falls for human artist Adrien instead, who treats her more kindly than the pack does. However, as the plot kicks in, Adrien rejects her in fear when she reveals herself to be a werewolf and later believes her to be responsible for the deaths in the city, leading to him setting out to shoot her. Meanwhile, Gabriel reveals Hidden Depths—he doesn't enjoy the endless fighting and bickering, but considers it necessary to establish the new pecking order and bring back peace to the pack in the wake of the attack that drove them from their home and killed several of their number, including the previous pack leader. He reveals that he tried to romance a human before as well and that it ended with him killing her by accident. In the end, Vivian comes to the conclusion that relationships between Muggles and Magicals are doomed to fail because their experiences are just too dissimilar to be able to truly relate to each other, and she chooses to be with Gabriel.
-   _The Dreamer_ has Bea caught between Alan, the dashing revolutionary war soldier she meets in her dreams, and Ben, the football captain at her high school and her long time crush.
-   In _Evernight_, half-vampire Bianca is torn between Lucas (a human) and Balthazar (a vampire). Her parents and many of her peers push her towards Balthazar, especially given Lucas was raised as a vampire hunter. At the end of the second book she chooses Lucas and simultaneously decides she won't become a full vampire (things don't _quite_ work out in that regard); although she cares for Balthazar, she realizes she doesn't love him the same as Lucas, and that she would only be choosing him because it's more convenient and socially acceptable. It's also implied Balthazar has a case of Loving a Shadow given Bianca's resemblance to his long dead love interest; he ends up with a human girl named Skye in his Spin-Off.
-   _The Familiar of Zero_: Saito, a Japanese teenage boy, gets summoned to a magical world by a Tsundere mage named Louise who forces him to become her Familiar by kissing him and they become attracted to each other. Louise's main love rival is Siesta, a Muggle Meido with a crush on Saito.

-   In Hans Christian Andersen's _The Little Mermaid_, the mermaid was a heroic young maiden with an intoxicating voice but forever bound to the sea. The land-princess is a little more housewifely and dutiful but has legs. It should be noted, though, that the prince didn't know he was in one of these. He had no idea the mermaid wasn't just a regular woman, so this didn't factor into his choice.

-   In _The Mortal Instruments_, Clary Fray has her childhood friend Simon Lewis, a normal boy (until halfway through _City of Ashes_) who is in love with her and she herself has a crush on demon-slaying Shadowhunter, Jace Wayland.
-   _Night World_:
    -   In _Spellbinder_, Eric, a human, forms a romantic relationship with Thea, who is a witch (he doesn't initially know she's a witch but he does realize there's something 'different' about her). His human co-worker Pilar also clearly has feelings for him; Eric likes Pilar but only as a friend, while he and Thea are soulmates. Thea attempts to put a spell on him to make him fall for Pilar instead to keep him safe, but it utterly fails and Eric calls Thea out for it, saying it's unfair to both him and Pilar.
    -   In _Dark Angel_, Gillian finds out she's a witch and has a romantic connection to both Angel, who claims to be her guardian angel/spirit, and David, a human classmate she's had a crush on for years. Gillian comes to distrust Angel for his increasingly immoral actions and realizes David is her soulmate. Angel doesn't take it well and unsuccessfully tries to possess David, though he eventually gives up because he doesn't want Gillian to be miserable.
    -   _Huntress_ has a downplayed example as neither love interest is that normal. Dhampir Jez Redfern is in love with Hugh, a human Old Soul who can recall his past lives, yet also ends up developing feelings for her vampire Childhood Friend Morgead. She and Morgead eventually realize they're soulmates; Hugh was also seemingly oblivious to Jez's feelings and as far as we can tell only loves her in a platonic sense.
-   _October Daye_: Changeling protagonist Toby had this in her past with Cliff (the Muggle) and Devin (the Magical); she chose Cliff but it fell apart for unrelated reasons. Later on, she's in a love triangle with two fae men.

-   In _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_, Percy's two major love interests are Annabeth, the demigoddess daughter of Athena, and Rachel, a mortal girl (albeit one who can see through the Mist). It's played with by the end, however, since Rachel becomes the new Oracle of Delphi at Camp Half-Blood, but only after a Ship Sinking moment with Percy.
-   Sort of happens in _Rebel Angels_. Gemma, who has magical abilities, has to choose between Simon Middleton, a rich heir, or Kartik. While Kartik isn't magical, he does know about her magic and is involved in the Masquerade. She chooses Kartik, though he dies near the end of the last book in the trilogy.
-   _Red Queen_: The main love triangle is between Mare, the protagonist, with Kilorn, her fellow commoner and Muggle Best Friend, and Cal and Maven, who are princes with fire powers. This gets subverted a lot, however; Mare herself has superpowers, yet she ends up rejecting Kilorn outright in the second book, while Maven is revealed to be evil, leaving Cal as the only eligible suitor for the remaining two books.
-   _Shakugan no Shana_: Yuuji is in a Love Triangle with Shana (supernatural Action Girlfriend) and Kazumi (normal classmate).
-   Supernatural Dark Action Girl assassin Yuki and Ojou Kaede play this to Takeo in _Tales of the Otori_.
-   _The Twilight Saga_ set up Bella/Jacob as this in _New Moon_ before revealing Jacob as a werewolf and shifting into a Vampire-Werewolf Love Triangle. Of course, in the first book Bella had three Muggle guys after her not _even_ counting Edward and Jacob, both of whom were also already interested.
-   In _Wintersmith_, the young witch Tiffany has attracted a supernatural Stalker with a Crush in the form of the titular Wintersmith, and everyone _knows_ that she's got an arrangement with the Baron's son, who's very much a Muggle. She chooses neither. She rejects the Wintersmith and he returns to his discorporate form, and she and Roland are just friends.

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ somewhat subverts the trope - while the Angel (Vampire)/Buffy (Magical Slayer)/Riley (human) triangle fits, by the point Riley shows up in Buffy's life she and Angel had already decided they should move on. Kind of. Then subverts it again when Spike develops a crush on Buffy, she and Riley break up for reasons that have nothing to do with Spike before Buffy finds out about his feelings.
-   _Charmed (1998)_:
    -   In season 2, Piper was torn between Dan, the Muggle love interest and Leo, who is a whitelighter.
    -   The final season had the sisters quickly finding and securing love and marriage. The secondary plot of one episode had half\-whitelighter Paige meeting a British half-whitelighter who basically demands she marry and produce superpowerful offspring with him because it was destined to be. This doesn't sit well with her Muggle fiance Henry who spends the rest of the episode explaining why he and Paige were meant to be while the British half-whitelighter tries to show Paige that her life is too dangerous to have a human husband plus he doesn't think Henry is a worthy mate for her. The episode ends with the two men actually sparring in an alleyway.

-   _Forever_: From "Dead Men Tell Long Tales" to "Best Foot Forward" Jo is being romanced by Isaac, ordinary mortal, which causes Henry, immortal, to realize the depth of his feelings for her. Played with in that Jo doesn't know Henry is immortal, only that he's exceptional.
-   This was the case in the first few episodes of _I Dream of Jeannie_; however, Tony's relationship with his Muggle fiancee didn't last long.
-   _Lost Girl_ had succubus Bo in a Love Triangle (at times a Love Dodecahedron) involving Dyson, a werewolf, and Lauren, a human doctor enslaved by the Fae. In one memorable scene, Bo turns her love triangle into a riddle—a trick question one.
    
    **Bo:** She's brilliant. He's strong. Her life is little. His life is long. Both loves are pure. Both loves are true. If you were I, who would you choose? \[...\]  
    **The Leviathan:** The man! He will live longer.  
    **Bo:** Final answer?  
    **The Leviathan:** No wait. Um, ah.. The woman. Uh, yes, you love her. You wear her humanity like a shield.  
    **Bo:** So we're sticking with the woman, Levi?  
    **The Leviathan:** No, um, wait uh the man. Yes, you crave strength. The man. I answer the man.  
    **Bo:** _\[Shakes head\]_  
    **The Leviathan:** \[...\] Was it the woman? I must know.  
    **Bo:** Hey, I was kind of hoping that you could tell me 'cause as far as I know there is no answer.

    -   Bonnie was briefly interested in both Jeremy, her best friend's younger brother, and newcomer Luka, a warlock. Luka soon proves to be untrustworthy and she gets together with Jeremy.

    Video Games 

-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   _Dragon Age: Origins_: The Male Warden's two female romance options are Leliana and Morrigan, a Badass Normal bard and a Hot Witch, respectively. (Or Zevran, an elven assassin.)
    -   _Dragon Age II_: Since Everyone Is Bi, straight male / lesbian female Hawkes can choose between Badass Normal Isabela and Cute Witch Merrill, straight female / gay male Hawkes can choose between Mage Anders and Muggle Fenris, and bi characters can enter any of the above _or_ a love triangle between Isabela v. Anders or Merrill v. Fenris.
    -   _Dragon Age: Inquisition_: Having introduced eight romance options(!!), this trope is in play for some Inquisitors but not others. Gay (or Bi) male Inquisitors can choose between the Necromancer Dorian and Boisterous Bruiser Iron Bull. Female Elven Inquisitors can choose between one of several muggle companions (or advisers!) or the Mage Solas. However, this trope does not apply to non-elven female Inquisitors because Dorian is gay, Solas can only be romanced by a female elf<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and all the other love interests are muggles. This trope also doesn't apply to straight male or lesbian female Inquisitors, because none of the potential female love interests are mages this time.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   _Mass Effect_: Male Shepard's romance options are the normal human soldier Ashley and the powerful telepathic biotic blue skinned asari Liara<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> .

    -   _Mass Effect 3_: For straight female Shepard, it's Garrus or Kaidan<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> . For gay male Shepard, it's the biotic Kaidan or normal human shuttle pilot Cortez. For gay female Shepard, the choice could be between the biotic Liara and the normal human Intel analyst Samantha Traynor. For straight male Shepard, it could be either Liara (gender isn't a concern for her) or Ashley or Tali, both of whom are just normal members of their species.
    -   _Mass Effect: Andromeda_: Straight female Ryder has a choice between regular humans Liam and Reyes versus Jaal whose species use bio-electricity in a manner similar to biotics. Lesbian Ryder has a choice between regular human scientist Suvi or regular turian Vetra versus asari biotics Peebee or Keri T’Vessa. Gay male Ryder can choose between Gil or Reyes for the muggles versus Jaal with bio-electric powers. Straight male Ryder has Vetra the normal turian versus the human biotic Cora, asari biotics Peebee and Keri or Avela with the same bio-electric powers as Jaal. Jaal, Peebee, Keri and Vetra swing both ways.
-   _Persona_:
    -   _Persona 3_: The protagonist has the option of dating Persona-users like Yukari, Mitsuru, and Fuuka, as well as more normal high school students like Yuko and Chihiro. This trope gets taken to another level with romance options for Aigis and Elizabeth, who make the Persona-users look like muggles in comparison.
    -   _Persona 4_ brings it back, with Chie, Yukiko, Rise, and Naoto being the datable Persona-users, Yumi/Ayane and Ai being the datable normal high school girls, and Marie being the even more supernatural love interest.
    -   _Persona 5_ has Ann, Makoto, Futaba, Haru, and Kasumi as the dateable Persona users, with the normal women consisting of Kawakami, Chihaya, Takemi, Ohya, and Hifumi.

-   _Ben 10: Omniverse_: Ben Tennyson has to choose between Ester, who is a half-Kraaho hybrid, and Kai, who is a regular human girl. He ends up with Kai.
-   _The Legend of Korra_: In Book 1, Mako, though being a bender himself, has to choose between Muggle Asami and Korra, who's the Avatar, bender of all 4 elements. He starts with Asami, breaks up with her due to various reasons and ends up with Korra at the end of Book 1. In Book 2, he and Korra break up. He and Asami kiss in the heat of the moment, but Korra comes back with Easy Amnesia and he pretends the breakup didn't happen. She eventually gets her memories back and breaks up with him a _second_ time. For the Book 4 Grand Finale, Korra and Asami end up together, meaning that she was the one with the choice between magic and muggle all along.
-   Zig-Zagged in _Miraculous Ladybug_. Superhero Cat Noir is smitten with fellow superhero Ladybug, but when he assumes the identity of Adrien Agreste, he sees civilian Marinette as no more than a friend.

After Star returns to her home dimension, Marco tries to continue dating Jackie-Lynn until the latter realizes that he's become unhappy on Earth following Star's departure and that he may have developed feelings for the princess as well. She proceeds to dump him so he can go live in said dimension and have a chance to be with Star.
    -   Star herself has a Love Triangle consisting of her, the aforementioned Badass Normal Marco, and the demon prince with fire powers Tom. In early seasons, Tom is Star's ex-boyfriend and sees Marco as a love rival, but Star ignores Tom's attempts of getting back together with her and Marco doesn't develop romantic interest in Star until much later. While Marco is dating Jackie-Lynn, Star tries to move on and rekindles her old relationship with Tom. By the time Marco and Jackie-Lynn break up, Star is back together with Tom and becomes confused by her own feelings for the two until Tom breaks up with her just before the final story arc begins. Star and Marco get together right before the Grand Finale.
-   In _Steven Universe_, Steven's Missing Mom Rose Quartz was in a Love Triangle with a fellow Gem, Pearl, and a human, Greg. In the end, Rose chose Greg, which is how Steven came to be. Pearl hasn't quite gotten over it.
