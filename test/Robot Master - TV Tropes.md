_"You know what I love about machines? They do what they're told."_

A scientist who specializes in building or maintaining robots.

If he is a Mad Scientist, this skill will probably manifest as an ability to effortlessly manufacture Mecha-Mooks in bulk. Robots don't have to be his only area of expertise (as a mad scientist, he's probably also an Omnidisciplinary Scientist), but he's a Robot Master if robot-making is far and away his most commonly displayed skill. For instance, Doctor Doom is a scientist who builds robots periodically, but fellow _Fantastic Four_ enemy the Mad Thinker builds robots virtually every time he appears.

Just building one robot doesn't qualify you for this trope. This is for people whose resumés are more than 50% taken up with robot-building or at least robot-fixing.

Not to be confused with the _Mega Man (Classic)_ Robot Masters, though this trope does apply to their creators.

May or may not overlap with Marionette Master. Many Igors qualify, depending on their bosses' area of expertise. Compare with Drone Deployer and The Turretmaster (for different kind of "robots") and Wicked Toymaker. If you were looking for a robot that _is_ a master, see Master Computer.

-   Wonder Woman's nemesis, the Robot Master! She defeats him with Twinkies.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Dr. Gero from _Dragon Ball Z_ made many robots to fight Goku, though some of them are cyborgs (17, 18, and himself) or artificial lifeforms (Cell).
-   Dr. Vegapunk of _One Piece_. This may change later on, as he's pretty much stated to have a whole plethora of other accomplishments under his belt, but his most prominent role in the story thus far is creating a small army of Pacifistas for the World Government.
-   Jail Scaglietti from _Lyrical Nanoha_. He also builds cyborgs.
-   Winry of _Fullmetal Alchemist_ is constantly repairing robotic limbs and such.
-   All Incarnations of Dr. Hell from the _Mazinger_ series are this to varying degrees.
-   Dr. Rotwang from _Tiger & Bunny_.
-   Engineer Sakaki from _Patlabor_.
-   Doctor Tenma and Doctor Ochanomizu from _Astro Boy_.
-   _Doll_ by Mitsukazu Mihara is an anthology series about humans interacting with robots, so it's only natural that many of its characters are robot specialists.
-   Norman Burg in _The Big O_ knows how to maintain a megadeus — though being an amnesiac like everyone his age in Paradigm City, he doesn't remember how he learned this skill. He repairs and maintains the Big O for Roger.
-   Biko Daitokuji (B-Ko) from _Project A-Ko_ is this as Tony Stark levels, a high school student capable of building a new Super Robot mecha to battle A-Ko every night.
-   Metal Knight, and to a lesser extent Child Emperor, from _One-Punch Man_.

    Comic Books 

-   Dr. Will Magnus, creator of the _Metal Men_.
-   The Mad Thinker from _Fantastic Four_.
-   The Toyman from _Superman_ can build lifelike androids, but prefers to make his killer robots look like toys.
-   _Justice League of America_:
    -   Dr. T.O. Morrow, creator of Red Tornado, Tomorrow Woman, and assorted other bots. They tend to rebel on him, but since he's evil, that's usually a good thing. Ironically, Morrow has at times expressed pride that he's capable of creating androids so intelligent they're _capable_ of going against their programming and rebelling against him.
    -   Professor Ivo built Amazo, a robot capable of mimicking his enemies' powers.
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   Spencer Smythe, creator of the Spider-Slayers. After his death, his son, Alistaire Smythe, continued his legacy by building more Spider-Slayers, eventually turning himself into a cyborg.
    -   Also minor Spidey antagonists Armada and Future Max.
    -   And minor character Mendel Stromm, who actually calls himself "Robot Master".
-   Dr. Abel Stack, who built Aaron Stack the Machine Man. He also helped build all the previous robots in Aaron's series, who all went mad. The reason Aaron turned out all right is that Abel actually raised him as a son. Of course, years later, the Celestials kidnapped Aaron, causing him to suffer a nervous breakdown and turn into the snarky, endearingly neurotic Jerkass we know from _Nextwave_, but that's another story.
-   Bolivar Trask, creator of the X-Men's robot nemeses, the Sentinels.
-   The (possible) Trope Namer from _The Transformers (Marvel)_ is actually an invocation of this trope: failing comic-book writer Donny Finkelberg is enlisted by the government to pose as his character "Robot Master" and claim credit for the Transformers' battles, as this was judged less publicly frightening than an alien civil war. Hilarity Ensues when the 'cons found out that some dumb squishy was pretending to be their master. In fact, when Megatron awakens, he decides to keep Finkleberg around to continue the charade, since he could make it look like _all_ robots are under his control, making it harder for the Autobots to enlist human allies. It doesn't _quite_ work in the long run, since it's kind of hard to explain why one guy would have two sets of robots fighting each other, but it becomes moot when Finkleberg manages to escape.
-   _The Avengers_: Despite being a robot himself, Ultron would certainly count. He built The Vision, Jocasta, Victorius, and Alkhema, as well as countless duplicates of himself — usually just replacement bodies for when he inevitably gets destroyed at the end of each appearance, but he has built armies of these duplicates on a couple of occasions (with the predictable Conservation of Ninjutsu in full effect). His unique creations have a tendency to rebel against him and become superheroes.
-   The Followers of the Light from _Shogun Warriors_ are aliens who built the titular Humongous Mecha to fight giant monsters.
-   Tyranik from _ManTech_ was driven mad by the same ancient "knowledge ray" that taught him about robotics, so he wants to wipe out mankind and replace it with robots.
-   The Katayanagi twins from _Scott Pilgrim_, though the building itself happens off-screen. In the comics, anyway; the film changes them to techno-themed Musical Assassins.
-   Baxter Stockman from the original _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ comics is a computer expert who builds small "Mouser" robots and uses them to commit crimes.
-   _Astro City_:
    -   The first Assemblyman creates rampaging robots for anyone who pays.
    -   Vivi Vector is a female example who thinks big — she's spent _decades_ infiltrating robotics and electronics systems worldwide with her creations.
    -   Ellie Jennersen was a robotics genius even before she got into college and broadened her expertise. Unfortunately, her potential was cut short after her roommate Mind Raped her and stole her work.
    -   Dr. Saturday is a Mad Scientist who builds giant robots that resemble cartoon characters.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: Byrna Brilyant, the "Snowman", is a brilliant roboticist who used her chemist father's notes to create a weather machine, and her own know how to make a battalion of identical rocket propelled robots and matching Powered Armor equipped with a Freeze Ray.
    -   Doctor Cyber traditionally has a legion of robotic assassins at her beck and call.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Sebastian in _Blade Runner_. "They're just toys, really..."
-   Nathan from _Ex Machina_.

    -   _Bride of Frankenstein_ introduces his sinister old mentor, Dr. Pretorius.
    -   _Son of Frankenstein_ is Exactly What It Says on the Tin with the doctor's son, Wolf Frankenstein, and also introduces the doctor's old assistant, Ygor.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   _The Ghost of Frankenstein_ introduces the doc's _other_ son, Ludwig.
    -   _Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man_ has the generally well-intentioned Dr. Mannering revive the monster. Dr. Frankenstein's beautiful granddaughter Elsa is hanging around, too.

    -   And in the Alternate Continuity of the Hammer Horror films, Peter Cushing's Dr. Frankenstein picks up his own assortment of assistants and sidekicks, including a hunchback played by Roddy McDowell.
    -   _Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter_ has (despite the title) Frankenstein's granddaughter Maria as the Mad Scientist, with her brother Rudolph as her sidekick.
-   The _Marvel Cinematic Universe_ version of Tony Stark/Iron Man is portrayed as one. While he prefers to build high-tech armor for himself, he has also programmed complex A.I.s such as JARVIS and keeps a couple of robotic arms that he built as a kid as his pets. This escalates in _Iron Man 3_ when he has JARVIS take control of his extra suits; and then in _Avengers: Age of Ultron_ he has a set of autonomous "Iron Legion" bots and is a major factor in creating both Ultron and Vision.
-   Rotwang from _Metropolis_ built an android he intended to turn into the likeness of his lost love, but he gets persuaded to turn her into an evil doppelganger of the saintly Maria instead. It's certainly implied that he would have liked to go back and finally make that android replacement for his lost love, but he gets killed.
-   Gene Simmons' Dr. Luther from _Runaway_ not only builds killer drones, he also sabotages existing household robots so they'll go berserk on command.

-   Doctor Impossible, from _Soon I Will Be Invincible_, uses a wide variety of tech but specialises in robots and doomsday devices.
-   Dr. Emil Lang from _Robotech_ is the world's leading authority on Robotechnology. "Robotechnology" actually refers to _all_ types of alien-derived technology on Earth, but the most visible type is all the Humongous Mecha running around.

-   _Wonder Woman (1975)_: "The Deadly Toys" features Frank Gorshin of the Riddler fame from _Batman (1966)_ as a Wicked Toymaker. His plan involves making a robot Wonder Woman to challenge the real Amazon Princess.

    Manhwa and Korean Animation 

-   The human cast of _Cubix: Robots for Everyone_.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Champions_:
    -   Robot Gladiators supplement. Dr. Anton Wolcott, Chief Roboticist of the Interstellar Gladiator Authority.
    -   Mechanon probably counts: as a robot, he used automated factories to make improved versions of himself.
-   Evil Sorcerer variant: Xin, the High King of ancient Thassilon in _Pathfinder_, was enamored with powerful clockwork automatons, and in fact was entombed in a "living" clockwork sarcophagus.
    -   House Ardoc in the city of Kaer Maga specializes in animating golems and other magical constructs.

    Theater 

-   The owner and employees of Rossum's Universal Robots in _R.U.R._, which famously coined the word "robot".
-   _Frankenstein_: Though only the first film would retain the name Fritz (later films renamed him Ygor or Igor), Dr. Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant Fritz actually dates back to early 19th century stage adaptations of Mary Shelley's novel.

    Video Games 

-   Gaige the Mechromancer and her Killer Robot / Science Fair project D374-TP a.k.a. "Deathtrap" from _Borderlands 2_.
-   Robotics Masterminds in _City of Heroes/Villains_ are playable robot masters.
-   Dr. Proton, in _Duke Nukem_, took over an entire city with the TechBots he'd built, not to mention the moon base (in Episode 2) and a city in the far-flung future (in Episode 3). This aspect was very much downplayed by the time of his appearance the 2011 game's DLC, "The Doctor Who Cloned Me", though the 2001 version might've seen him play a larger role, Robot Master status included.
    -   Mech Morphix, the Dr. Proton Expy in _Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project_, could also qualify, though his army had fewer varieties of robot. Morphix had been intended to _be_ Dr. Proton, but Proton was still in line to be the villain in ''Forever'' at the time.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_
    -   In the series' Backstory, the extinct Dwemer were masters at creating mechanical "animunculi", ranging from miniature spider centurion workers to sphere and steam centurion soldiers to full blown Humongous Mecha. As the Dwemer were known to tinker with the "earthbones" (essentially the laws of physics and nature in the _ES_ universe), they could make their creations impervious to wear and tear, meaning that many are still up and running even thousands of years after their disappearance.
    -   _Morrowind_:
        -   Edwinna Elbert, Stewardess of the Ald-Ruhn Mages Guild, studies Dwemer creations. If one brings her a copy of a certain rare book, she'll mention how she wants to be one of these, believing it will make her famous.
        -   In the _Tribunal_ expansion, one can meet Ignatius Flaccus in Mournhold. Ignatius spends his time restoring Dwemer centurions to use as combatants in his robot arena. Of course, he quickly learns the hard way that Dwemer creations tend to behave erratically if taken outside of Dwemer ruins.
-   _Fallout_:
    -   In theory, this is 0's _job_ in Big MT in _Fallout: New Vegas Old World Blues_. In practice, while he's not too bad at the mechanical side of things (his modification of RobCo's Securitrons _are_ more powerful, despite having been in the open seemingly without maintenance for centuries), his software skills are... not quite up to the task (his robots either a) have gone berserk or b) hates their job). Mr. House of New Vegas has elements of this himself — while his skills extended quite a bit beyond robots, it _was_ a major focus of him and the company he created, RobCo, and in the modern day his influence on the outside world mainly occurs through controlled and sometimes modified Securitrons. He's also implied to have had a hand in the creation of Liberty Prime.
    -   _Fallout 4_
        -   The Mechanist is an expert of robotics and has an army of robot for terrorizing the Commonwealth and killing everything coming across their path, complete with a factory as the lair to mass produce the robots. You can become one after acquiring the Robot Workshop as well.
        -   The Institute, and Father, also qualify to some extent with their synths: machines that emulate the appearance and behaviors of humans. While Gen 1 and Gen 2 synths look more like mannequins than people, Gen 3 synths are practically indistinguishable from humans. How much the Institute qualifies as robot masters is largely dependent on whether one considers synths to be mere machines or living beings.
-   In _Five Nights at Freddy's_, Big Bad William Afton was a roboticist and Serial Killer who used his talents to create his own line of Suck E. Cheese's to prey on children in.
-   Dr. Elvin Atombender in _Impossible Mission_: "Destroy him, my robots!"
-   Lord Agony from _Lock's Quest_.
-   Dr. Wily and Dr. Light from the _Mega Man (Classic)_ games, whose main robots are coincidentally known as Robot Masters.
-   Lightspeakers from _Nexus Clash_ are fragile, cheerful angels devoted to defending justice and protecting the innocent by building and maintaining an army of relentless robotic minions. They're much more positive than most examples of this trope, but their armies can be incredibly dangerous if they fall prone to the Black-and-White Insanity that often tempts angels in the Nexus.
-   In _Professor Layton and the Curious Village_, we have Bruno, who built ALL of the inhabitants of St. Mystere with the exception of the late Baron Reinhold's daughter, Flora
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_'s diabolical Doctor Eggman, whose portfolio includes trying to turn everyone in the world into a robot.
-   Purge from _Space Channel 5 Part 2_ makes hundreds of robots to face off against Ulala. Apparently he's so talented, he mass-produced the Peace Carrier 8 times in under a day.
-   _Spyborgs_ have it's Big Bad, Jackal, being a rogue roboticist whose army of machines dominates the city, and you need to stop him.
-   Ju Shifang from _Sword & Fairy 6_ is a playable example. He builds remotely-controlled robotic bears in Wuxia setting! He carries one of them around in backpack form, and deploys it when battle begins.

    Webcomics 

-   Agatha Heterodyne of _Girl Genius_.
-   In _Homestuck_, the Troll Equius Zahhak is quite skilled at building robots and cybernetic limbs. He does this so that he can blow off steam by fighting killer robots.
-   Rika, a British example from _RPG World_.
-   In _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_, Sean "Dark Smoke Puncher" McNinja likes to build robot animals with laser vision and stuff. Their main job is to guard the family home, but that's just an excuse—he just likes making the suckers.
-   Molly from _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ builds lots of robots, mostly for fun. Only one of them has turned out sentient — the one made out of a milking machine. Two of the others are made of _snow_, and of those, one can transform into a giant ice ballista. Yes.

    Web Original 

-   _Doctor Steel_, creating an army of giant robots, and having a robot band. And a lot of robot toys.

    Western Animation 

-   Jack Spicer from _Xiaolin Showdown_ uses a wide array of robots in addition to the series's magical MacGuffins.
-   _The Transformers_:
    -   The Quintessons, who may or may not be machines themselves, are perhaps the biggest example in the franchise. They're the original creators of the entire Transformer race, and seem to have created several species of metallic minions like their Sharkticons and Allicons. Some media credits them with the direct creation of the animalistic Decepticon combiner teams of the Predacons and Terrorcons. They seem to have a thing for making transforming animal robots.
    -   The supercomputer TORQ-III from the episode "Day of the Machines" is described as a "machine that can build other machines." When Megatron reprograms TORQ to be hostile, TORQ commands all of the robots he's built to go on a rampage.
    -   Any of the "medic" characters, like Ratchet or First Aid, would qualify for "maintaining" robots. As Mechanical Lifeforms, they just think of it in different terms. Wreck-Gar and Alpha Trion would probably count, too.
    -   Dr. Fujiyama, creator of Nightbird the robot ninja.
-   _Transformers: Animated_'s Isaac Sumdac, who reverse engineered technology from Megatron's head, resulting in Detroit being a center of robot production.
-   Ming's flunky Dr. Tav from _Flash Gordon (1979)_. Dr. Tav invented Ming's army of Mecha-Mooks.
-   Though he has many other accomplishments, Dexter from _Dexter's Laboratory_ is constantly building robots.
-   Tobey from _WordGirl_, with his mega-giant-attack robots.
-   Dr. Von Richter from _Cybersix_ specialized in biological androids.
-   _DuckTales (1987)_: Gyro Gearloose. After one disaster, Scrooge McDuck specifically forbade Gyro from making robots, because A.I. Is a Crapshoot. At least once Gyro attempted to get around this restriction by building piloted robots, and rather than causing mayhem on their own, the Beagle Boys simply stole them and caused mayhem anyway. He tried once more in the third season, building a sentient robot maid who promptly fell in Mad Love with Fenton and went berserk; Gyro _was_ ultimately able to pacify her without having to junk her, though. Third time's the charm, apparently.
    -   Gyro's bad track record with robots is played up even more in the 2017 reboot. Frustration with his robots "turning evil" is actually what drives him to bypass A.I. entirely and build the piloted Gizmoduck suit instead. He did manage to create one robot that never went evil on its own, though: 2B0, AKA B.O.Y.D.
-   Ziv Zulander from the appropriately titled _The Bots Master_, a Teen Genius responsible for introducing semi-advanced robots, called 3As<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  to his world. He also built a bunch of even more advanced robots, who are sentient with human-like personalities, called BOYZZ<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   In _Bolts & Blip,_ all the robots on the Moon were built by Dr. Tommy, except the evil Mecha-Mooks who were built by Dr. Blood.
-   Nora Wakeman, Jenny's "Mom" from _My Life as a Teenage Robot._
-   Dr. Nightmare, a _Space Ghost_ villain who builds Mechanical Monsters.
-   _Kaeloo_: Olaf the emperor penguin has his own robot, which he uses to get anyhing he wants or needs. He also once turned Stumpy into a cyborg, and he built a robot army in the second season finale.
-   Sunfire's crazy uncle in the _Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends_ episode "Sunfire" first built a bunch of samurai-themed Mecha-Mooks, then created a giant artificial fire monster (you know, the one from the show's opening credits).
-   _Wander over Yonder_:
    -   Knight of Cerebus Lord Dominator has an army of lava-powered robots as a Darker and Edgier counterpoint to Lord Hater's live army of Watchdogs. Amusingly, Lord Hater seems to _think_ he's one of these (arguably a Mythology Gag in that the Watchdogs were originally conceived as Do-Anything Robots:
        
        **Hater:** You know those eyeball guys I have? How often do I need to change their batteries?
        
    -   Aging villain Mandrake the Malfeasant has an appropriately retro army of Tin-Can Robots.
-   _OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes_: Lord Boxman creates all of his robotic minions, making a whole business out it. His corporation supposedly sells them to other villains, but his own obsession with destroying the plaza tends to stymie much of his sales.
