_"So... What are you wearing?"_

People have sex. People also have phones. Therefore, in longstanding human tradition, people found a way to combine the two.

Generally a comedy trope, this is when characters who aren't close enough to physically touch decide to find a way to make do. It is usually mutual, but occasionally a creepy caller will use this as part of a sexual harassment campaign.

A common variant is the "sex hotline," where customers call a service for this. The provider will be typically be revealed to the audience to be ugly and definitely not wearing the sexy clothing they claim. The common Bathroom Stall Graffiti "For a good time call..." alludes to this, implying that the number is a paid phone sex line.

"Sexting" is the version for just texting; it is often portrayed negatively as part of New Media Are Evil. "Send nudes" is similar, asking for salacious images to be sent through text. There's also "cybersex" when this is done through the internet, usually with a webcam or (later) video phone.

Usually involves Aroused by Their Voice. Nine Hundred Numbers were most notorious for these types of chat lines (that and Phony Psychics), even though those numbers could be providing _any_ type of service, including completely innocuous ones like weather reports and sports statistics.

-   Seemingly implied in the "Jake from State Farm" commercial when a woman comes down the stairs and catches her husband apparently having phone sex, only for him to tell her that he's talking to their insurance agent. Subverted when it turns out that he's telling the truth, even though she won't believe it.
    
    **Husband**: Yeah, I'm married. Does it matter? Would you do that for me? Really? Yeah, I'd like that.
    
    **Wife**: _(Comes down and turns on the light)_ Who're you talking to?
    
    **Husband**: It's Jake from State Farm. _(On the phone)_ It sounds like a really good deal.
    
    **Wife**: Jake from State Farm at _3 in the morning_? _(Snatches phone)_ Who is this?!
    
    **Husband**: It's... Jake from State Farm.
    
    **Wife**: Well what are you wearing "Jake from State Farm"?

-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_: Downplayed. Kaguya and Shirogane spend almost 5 1/2 hours talking on the phone in chapter 170 as they lie in their beds (and the only reason it wasn't longer is because the former isn't used to staying up late and eventually passed out). Nothing sexual actually happens, though it is framed in such a way to make it seem like they're lying next to each other.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Dilbert_: Accidentally invoked when Dilbert leaves voice mail on the Pointy-Haired Boss's phone late at night to create the impression that he's working late. Unfortunately, in his half-asleep state he words the message rather badly... and worse, sends it to the entire office.
    
    **Dilbert:** Hi. it's two in the morning, I'm sitting here in my underwear, and I thought of you.
