Often, mediums use visual cues to denote what kind of political system someone is participating in. Since the rise and fall of fascism and the advent and end of The Cold War, a kind of sartorial shorthand has developed in media to indicate that a given political leader is The Generalissimo, A Nazi by Any Other Name, or otherwise heading up The Dictatorship.

Many of these are inspired by the grandiose fashion senses of actual dictators such as Benito Mussolini, Idi Amin, Muammar Gaddafi, Augusto Pinochet, and many, many more. In particular, Adolf Hitler and Those Wacky Nazis have influenced enough of this trope that they have a Sub-Trope — Putting on the Reich — all to themselves.

Such fashion cues include, but are not limited to:

-   Constantly wearing ceremonial military uniforms like greatcoats — usually grey, black, dark blue, or green — to reflect how militaristic the dictator is, often paired with:
    -   Commissar Caps — the larger-crowned, the better, likely to make them look taller or more grandiose.
    -   A Chest of Medals, or other forms of Bling of War, to highlight their accolades — earned or otherwise.
    -   Large epaulettes — also to make them look bigger and grander.
-   A sash or baldric — to signify their status as leader, like a monarch's crown.<sup>However, in real life...&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Sunglasses — usually aviators, and usually for the leader of a Banana Republic. This can make them look more intimidating.
-   Nazi-style armbands — often with a symbol of their regime on it.
-   A red-and-black colour scheme.
-   Facial hair — popularized by Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler.

Expect Dirty Commies, Commie Nazis, and especially Banana Republic leaders to shop at these outlets. The Sukhomlinov Effect may come into play.

Pink's own outfit in the movie is a black Nazi-style uniform with a black and red "hammer" armband, a black leather baldric across his chest, and a black leather greatcoat that he wears like a cape.

    Video Games 

-   _Evil Genius 2_: After Red Ivan went from Henchman to full-fledged Evil Genius, he was given his own country to rule. This brought with it a change in attire to a red military uniform, with several medals (complete with a giant one on his sash), oversized epaulettes, and a big Commissar cap.
-   _Far Cry 6_: Anton Castillo is the military president of Yara, and dresses in a white military uniform with a red shirt, numerous medals on his chest (one of which he tortures his son Diego with by putting the medal in Diego's hand and making him squeeze it until the pin pierces his palm), and a nice case of Perma-Stubble instead of a full beard. Anton _doesn't_ wear a Commissar cap, but two of his enforcers, Admiral Ana Benitez and Anton's nephew General Jose Castillo, _do_: in Jose's case, he's most impressive in that he manages to keep his cap on no matter what bad things happen to him, like being shot In the Back by his own cousin or having his personal attack helicopter blown out of the sky.

-   In _Super Animal Royale Tonight_, the Finch is introduced wearing a red armband with the Rebellion's insignia on it, along with a bandolier. In later episodes, we see him wearing a military uniform with a sash. His appearance is likely highlighted by the fact that his feathers are green.
-   _Tropico_: The standard template for a male Presidente (and the one that appears in all the series' marketing) has a Commissar Cap, sunglasses, and military apparel, complete with medals and epaulettes. With the game being a parody of dictatorships and Banana Republics in general, it makes sense.

    Real Life 

-   Adolf Hitler wore many uniforms throughout his political career. During his campaigning years, Hitler would wear the SA uniform, consisting of a brown shirt, tie, and trousers. Once the Nazis seized power, Hitler was more accustomed to wearing brown civil uniforms and peaked caps. Throughout World War II, The Fuhrer wore simple feldgrau uniforms in order to ingratiate himself with the rank and file soldiery. Hitler's uniforms weren't the most grandiose, especially compared to his underlings like Herman Göring, in order to emphasize his common man image.
-   As the first Fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini was arguably the Trope Codifier. When he first was appointed Prime Minister in 1922, Mussolini would wear the standard morning suit<small>◊</small>. Once his rule was cemented, Mussolini would commonly wear his most well-known ensemble: The standard uniform of the army paired with a black shirt and tie, paired with a fez adorned with the fascist eagle.<small>◊</small>
-   Muammar Gaddafi, the dictator of Libya, was infamous for many things; among them was his fashion sense. The Colonel's outfits were varied throughout his long period as Libya's Brother Leader. During his early reign he typically wore garish, medal-covered military uniforms and flashy suits. By the 90s and 2000s, Gaddafi settled on wearing elaborate bedouin robes, he was also partial to sporting sunglasses.
