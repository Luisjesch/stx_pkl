_"Thank you so much for the new socks. They're right warm and a snug fit. Yeah, I'm doing well. Although this war has grown a little wearisome. Nothing much interesting ever happens these parts. Today I landed a Nazi helicopter on a nicked Nazi nuclear submarine aircraft carrier. After which I donned a deep-water diving suit, swam down an abyssal trench in the middle of the Atlantic fucking ocean, don't mean to bother you with the details. Long story short, I'm in a secret vault full of things so magical and abnormal in nature the mind has no recourse but to shudder in bewilderment. 'Course I'm accompanied by a Nazi-killing lunatic and some kind of genius wizard who claims to be on a first-name basis with God Almighty himself. Ah, well, we can only hope for a more stimulating turn of events in the future. Give my love to everyone back home, Fergus out."_

A specific type of Token Human, The Unfazed Everyman is an ordinary human with no special powers, who happens to hang around with aliens, time travellers, espers or wizards, and assorted other weirdos. Unlike most of their kind for whom such oddbods are invisible, Unfazed Everymen have a great capacity to cope with and _accept_ the incomprehensible wackiness that surrounds them; in many cases with a wise and rational demeanor. Generally, they are in there so that the audience has somebody to relate to. Commonly the main character, and may be a Fish out of Water or/and an Unlucky Everydude. May or may not be played up as losers. They've probably been dragged into this by a Magnetic Plot Device, and usually used to it, such that everything they see only causes a Dull Surprise at most. Expect them to become Pals with Jesus.

Compare Badass Normal, a person whose lack of superpowers doesn't get in the way of kicking evil ass; Ordinary High-School Student, who may look like this in the beginning, but eventually is revealed to be another thing; Superpower Silly Putty, who is actively affected in weird ways by the strangeness around him; and The Everyman, who is like this trope but with less personality. Contrast Only Sane Man, who loudly insists that none of this can possibly be happening. Compare Heroic Bystander, who despite his lack of powers actually manages to help, and the Action Survivor.

If they are protagonists, they tend to be Muggle Weight on the Super Weight scale. If they join a team, they are The Team Normal.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Only Sane Man Furuichi from _Beelzebub_ eventually becomes one, and gets Mistaken for Badass as a result.
-   _Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo_: Despite the extreme, glass-shattering reactions to her companions' antics most of the time, Beauty has no issue with staying with Bo-bobo and his downright insane group of rebel fighters; in fact, she embraces her life with them with joy. The end of the sequel manga has her mention that she rejoined Bo-bobo for another adventure, despite the danger because she had grown to love his insane, comedic lifestyle.
-   Tomoyo in _Cardcaptor Sakura_ has no special powers but serves as Sakura's assistant, helping to keep her life as a Cardcaptor a secret.
-   Matt from _Death Note_. He knows nothing about killer notebooks but unquestioningly goes along for the ride when Mello chases after Kira.
-   Bulma in _Dragon Ball_. Despite seeing powerful enemies that can blow up planets, she doesn't see it as a big deal and calmly goes about her techy business until really strange or out-of-this-world happens. Not even Vegeta's temper-tantrums faze her. Especially so during the Androids saga, where she seems even more unfazed than the heroes themselves at all the powerful villains going around. She even actively follows the heroes when Frieza shows up again twice, just because she wants to finally catch a glimpse of him.
-   _Dungeon Toilet_: Despite being an ordinary person who gets teleported to fantasy world and becomes an adventurer, Yotaro seems to take it all in stride. He worries more about running out of toilet paper than dying in battle.
-   Maes Hughes from _Fullmetal Alchemist_ is the sole regular bloke in a cast filled with Homunculi, Hammy super-soldiers, hard-nosed veterans and murderous assassins, most of which can wipe out entire buildings via some application of Alchemy. Hughes takes it all in stride, being just at the cusp of a Badass Normal and happily pointing out that his job keeps him safe behind a desk away from such casual, everyday horrors. Lampshaded in one fight where Hughes ducks for cover until it's all over, pointing out that a guy like him had no choice but to hide in a "contest of freaks."
-   Kyon from _Haruhi Suzumiya_. He does have one thing that sets him apart from everyone else: He's John Smith. This fact puts him in Badass Normal territory because it allows him to control Haruhi, Yuki's boss, and almost anyone who knows of Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody. It also explains why Haruhi gravitated towards him: he's the reason she came to North High to begin with (she just doesn't know it yet).
-   In _Inuyasha_, Kagome's mother, brother, and grandfather are totally unsurprised when they learn the well in their shrine is a time portal to the 16th century, as well as learning that supernatural demons exist. They also don't seem to be concerned about Kagome skipping school to go to a place where she nearly gets killed on a regular basis.
-   Kimihito Kurusu of _Monster Musume_ is surprisingly tolerant of the misfortunes that constantly befall him. The world HAS gotten used to the existence of monster girls (mostly), but good GOD can that man adapt fast.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_'s Asakura; she's one of the first girls to discover Negi's magical abilities, yet never gained any sort of magic or kung fu abilities of her own until near the end of the series, and it was an emergency situation. Despite that, she was still able to be more or less self-sufficient when she was forced to fend for herself in the Magic World.
    -   Jonny "Blazing Rumbling Trucker" Raidein is one in the Magic World arc, being nearly the only non-empowered person in the crew. He helps out Ala Alba purely because he's friends with some of the girls, and takes the whole "saving the world" thing in stride.
-   Kaede from _Ninja Nonsense_. She apparently spends a good chunk of her free time hanging around a ninja mansion despite being an Ordinary High-School Student.
-   Haruhi Fujioka, from _Ouran High School Host Club_, who starts out utterly weirded out by the bishonen antics of the aforementioned club, but gradually learns to cope, even enjoy herself a bit.
-   Oz from _PandoraHearts_ takes pride in his ability to accept the oddities he encounters and adapt to them. This manga is one big Alice Allusion Mind Screw, so having that kind of adaptability deserves some applause. Subverted when his true origins are revealed.
-   Everyone in _Pokémon: The Series_ who follows Ash and Pikachu.<sup>*&nbsp;</sup>  This is especially evident in the movies. The Japanese name of the guy from the first Unova Gym that follows Ash (Dent) seems more likely a coincidence than a Lampshade Hanging, though.
-   Nabiki Tendo of _Ranma ½_. For the most part, she's unfazed by the gender-bending, shape-shifting, and martial arts insanity surrounding her, getting involved only to the degree that she can make money from it. Her sister Kasumi is an even better example. She's never even fazed at the insanity surrounding her family, to the point where she constantly refers to Ranma's various mortal enemies as his "friends."

-   Tsukune in _Rosario + Vampire_ is an ordinary high school student who ends up going to a school intended for monsters learning to blend in with humans. Despite not having any superpowers, he quickly accepts that monsters exist and learns to operate within their realm.

-   Ataru Moroboshi of _Urusei Yatsura_. Though, this might be subverted as time goes on, as he seems to gain an inhuman level of super-speed (whether running away from trouble or running after a woman) and a comic invulnerability that would make Daffy Duck proud.
    -   The Principal of Tomobiki High School is a much clearer example. No matter how much insanity is going on around him he shows little to no concern about it.
-   Kawachi from _Yakitate!! Japan_ is an average guy stuck in a world of overly-dramatic bakers who break out all sorts of crazy recipes and techniques and get entangled in life-or-death bread-making contests.
-   Sota Mizushino from _Re:CREATORS_ adjusts pretty quickly to the fact that fictional characters are appearing in the real world.
-   Setsu, the protagonist of _Oddman 11_, is the only main character who's not an Oddman, meaning she's not a Cute Monster Girl, nor does she have any other bizarre quirks like a masochistic streak or a lifelong aversion to bathing or wearing clothing. At least, until she's beaten to a pulp by Nuida, and is able to return nearly to full health in only a day by being taken to her favorite comic store.
-   Parodied in _Buso Renkin_ by the nameless female cashier at the local McDonald's stand-in, who ends up selling burgers to random alchemists and homunculi who start showing up in full costume. In her second appearance she's shown yelling "I QUIT!" at her hapless manager after two homunculi order a hundred burgers, but by the end of the manga she's shown grudgingly going on with the job, having mostly gotten used to all this nonsense.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_: Alfred Pennyworth's duties as butler at Wayne Manor include cooking, cleaning, laundry, tending the _often serious_ injuries of the Bat-Family, maintaining crimefighting equipment and sometimes using firearms to defend the Manor and Cave. He does this all without losing his composure, wrecking his suit or missing tea. Some versions of Alfred's backstory justify his extraordinary competence and composure by making him a former intelligence agent or Marine veteran, and thus less an "everyman".
-   Marvel's _The Avengers,_ through their founding member and frequent-chairman, Iron Man, has their own British butler (complete with ex-Royal Air Force veteran backstory), Jarvis, who's a Nice Guy with a personality (at least in the main Earth-616 universe), that is the exact opposite of that of DC's Alfred.
-   _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_: Donald Duck. On the one hand, he's often portrayed as the flawed everyman who struggles in everyday life and with his adopted nephews, his cranky neighbors or his fiancee, on the other hand he often enough takes part in his Uncle Scrooge's global adventures that often enough include mystics and magic. He also helps his uncle fighting gangsters, witches and other kind of enemies. It doesn't really occur to him that dealing with this kind of things aren't that usual.
-   _Superman_:
    -   Jimmy Olsen. The city of Metropolis seems to get their superhero-supervillain battle updates after the weather report, so he might not be as unique as he seems...
    -   _The Living Legends of Superman_: When a stranger dressed as Superman appears and collapses on Benedix family's doorstep, and Riley suggests he might be a time-traveler, his family's collective reaction is: "Oh. Would you like to stay for dinner, sir?"
-   _Justice League of America_: Snapper Carr, the team's mascot/collective sidekick back in the '60s.
-   _The Incredible Hulk_: Rick Jones, sidekick to the Marvel Universe. In his time, he's been partnered with the Hulk, Captain America, two Captain Marvel's, and The Avengers as a whole, and throughout most of it he's had no powers.
-   Jeremy Feeple from _Ninja High School_ is no doubt this, especially considering the weirdness he attracts to himself.
-   From his own point of view, Howard the Duck is one of these for the Marvel Universe. True, he is an anthropomorphic duck, but he comes from a world where that is normal so living among humans does seem like being surrounded by strange aliens to him. What is more, his attempts at leading a normal, blue-collar life are constantly being interrupted by encounters with people who are even considered strange by Earth standards, such as the Man-Thing and the She-Hulk.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Dreaming of Sunshine_, Shikako describes the civilians of the Hidden Villages as this as they are able to unflappably live regular lives alongside ninja who could easily massacre them with their training.
-   In _Know Thyself: the Prelude_, Harry takes it astonishingly well when he is unplugged and told the full-extent of the Earths decimated state and their war with the machines. This is justified since what he thought was originally "normal" was him being beaten senseless for not being "normal" by his family and the crew on the Nebuchadnezzar treated him with more kindness than they ever did; not to mention the fact that the Rebels have made it a rule to unplug them at around Harrys age because children are less susceptible to going mad when unplugged, not having been in the Matrix as long as adults.
-   _Rise of the Minisukas_: In sharp contrast to Asuka's role as the only sane woman, Shinji has steadily become borderline unflappable to the absurd occurrences that he's witnessed and experienced following his first battle against Sachiel. Whether he is fighting Angels, dealing with miniature -and seemingly omnipresent- redheads that are constantly protecting him, or abruptly assaulted by the Armenian mafia. Asuka herself seems to take notice of this to a certain extent.
    
    _"Hey Third?"_  
    _"Hmm? What's up Asuka?"_  
    _"Is… this place always so weird?"_  
    _"What do you mean?" He asks with a confused look on his face. She'll take that as a yes._  
    _"Nevermind." She could feel a headache beginning to form because of all this nonsense._
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The cab driver in the 1990 _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ film nonchalantly tells a passenger that a big turtle in a trench coat rolled over the hood of the cab when the passenger asks. He immediately brushes it off and asks if the passenger is still trying to go to La Guardia.

-   Agent John Meyers in the first _Hellboy_ film, an FBI agent who gets transferred to the "nonexistent" Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. He's chosen by Professor Bruttenholm specifically to be Hellboy's conscience and moral helper. Too bad he's Put on a Bus in the sequel.
-   _Ghostbusters_:
    -   Janine Melnitz from the original duology. She is surrounded by men who hunt ghosts, half of whom are mad scientists. She even has a ghost in a cage close to where she works that the busters keep as a "pet". Not once has she ever batted an eye at any of this.
    -   Winston Zeddmore was this in the first film, casually commenting "As long as there's a steady paycheck in it, I'll believe anything you say."
-   _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_: Gloriously invoked by one of Indy's unnamed college students who, upon seeing his professor and a strange greaser slide under his library table on a motorcycle, interrupts his studying... to ask Indy a question about the homework. Better yet, Indy stops to answer his question and dispense some good advice without regard to the fact that he's currently running for his life.

-   The Love Interest from _Red (2010)_. Sarah is kidnapped, drugged, shot at, almost blown up, and kidnapped again. She is surrounded by old and young spies, assassins and government agents who are fighting over her life all the time. What does she say when she is confronted with the death sentence or life in prison if she is caught? "Awesome." And when she finally is? That her boyfriend will kick the interrogator's ass. The movie is full of lines like this from her.
    -   There's a strong indication that Sarah is taking to life with the spies Like a Duck Takes to Water.
-   Francesco Dellamorte, _Cemetery Man_ - for some reason, unbeknownst to both the townsfolk and the audience, all corpses in the Buffalora cemetery reanimate seven days after burial. Despite having no clue as to why this happens, Francesco expresses neither surprise nor concern and instead dispatches zombies nightly without batting an eyelid. He refuses to inform the authorities of the situation because he does not want the cemetery closed, which would put him out of a job.
    -   "This is my business. They pay me for it." "There comes a moment in life when you realize you know more dead people than living." "Disposing of dead people is a public service, whereas you're in all sorts of trouble if you kill someone while they're still alive." "Hold on a minute Franco - \*shoots zombie\* - You were saying, Franco."
-   _Licence to Kill_: Borderline. As the main distributor for the biggest drug lord in the Western Hemisphere, the televangelist Joe Butcher isn't quite an everyman, but he has nothing to do with the muscle end of the business. Nevertheless, he takes it pretty well when an undercover DEA agent holds him at gunpoint and locks him in his own chamber, or when she snatches his bag full of cash later on as she drives by.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   In his time, Agent Phil Coulson meets a Super Soldier, a guy in Powered Armor, a Norse god, and a green rage monster while still remaining a slightly jaded Deadpan Snarker. Though he's a bit less blase about the Super-Soldier. For example, he had to recall one of his fellow SHIELD agents, Natasha Romanov, interrupting her in the middle of her unique interrogation style. She tells him to hold over the phone, while she summarily curb-stomps her captors... while Coulson is on the other end of the line hearing the whole fight and acting as if he's listening to boring hold music.
    -   There's also the janitor played by Harry Dean Stanton who helps out Bruce Banner. Coulson, at least, is a full-fledged secret agent — this guy sees a giant naked green man crash through a warehouse ceiling and decides to find him some pants once he goes back to normal.
    -   The two prominent human characters in _Eternals_, Karun and Dane, are not that shocked at the events unfolding in front of them. Karun is a Secret-Keeper for Kingo and is happy to hang out with superheroes and capture footage for an Eternals documentary. Dane is similarly unperturbed, and one of his first questions to Sersi upon learning about Eternals and Deviants is whether she can turn him into a giraffe.
    -   By Phase 4, everyone is so used to alien invasions, killer robots, _half the universe being dusted and undusted_, etc, that they're mostly unfazed by everything weird happening around them. In _Eternals_, despite the initial shock seeing Arishem showing up in Earth's orbit, nothing indicates a massive panic attack.
-   Not alien or fantastical, but Slevin Kedevra in _Lucky Number Slevin_ shortly after the intro gets pulled into the world of mob bosses and hit men (by being mistaken for a dude that owes them a lot of money), but acts completely unfazed by most of his ordeals. Subverted though, in that he _intended_ for all this to happen, so he could enact his revenge upon the mob bosses who killed his father.
-   Not alien or fantastical either, but Keiko Nishi in _The Big Hit_ goes from being a normal everyday heiress to enthusiastic participation in her new boyfriend's high-end assassination business and takes being kidnapped, bounced around in a life-or-death joyride, and other weirdness pretty much in stride.
-   Mills of _The Living Wake_ is a bit of a Cloud Cuckoo Lander, but compared to his surroundings, including his Upper-Class Twit of a best friend who has until exactly 7:30 that night to live, he's quite ordinary. He doesn't appear to mind, though. Organizing and Attending Your Own Funeral? Well, if that's what K. Roth wants! Random musical numbers? Just another day! Smuggling horrible and disturbing children's books into a library? Sure, why not! Distracting a ninety-year-old man so K. Roth can go on a date with his wife? On it!
-   Agent Jay in the first _Men in Black_ movie was more than willing to accept that aliens exist, are in fact all around us, enough so to join the Men in Black. What he doesn't get is Agent Kay's behavior and quick use to the memory eraser pen.
    -   Kay returns it in the sequel, when he's brought out of neuralizer-induced retirement. Discovering that _all_ of his coworkers at the small town post office are disguised aliens, what's his reaction? Calmly reprimand one of them for smoking in public.
    -   The MIB's doorman. He's perfectly aware of all the shenanigans going on inside MIB headquarters (and outside for that matter), but he's never seen doing anything but sitting on a bench in the entrance hall reading the paper and making casual conversation with the agents as they come and go. Even when the villain of the second movie completely takes over MIB headquarters and releases various alien criminals inside, Kay and Jay return to find him in exactly the same place.
        
        **Doorman**: \[not looking up\] It's about time you guys got here. That pretty lady in there is causing all kinds of hell.
        
-   _The Scorpion King_: Philos, the favorite scientist of the Big Bad. He mostly takes it in stride when a towering Akkadian warrior he's never seen before comes barreling through his lab, twice, with his boss' guards in hot pursuit, and recovers quickly even from having a sword stuck at his throat. The head guard's casual death threat suggests he's no stranger to belligerent warriors storming through his offices.

    Literature 

-   Quinn from _Gone_.
-   Former Trope Namer Arthur Dent in _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. Though he notably gains the power of _Flight_, not that it matters since he only uses it for sex and eavesdropping on birds.
    -   He is also _very_ good at making sandwiches.
    -   And he carries a _very_ useful towel.
    -   In the original radio series, he progresses to Badass Normal over the course of the Brontitall storyline, even holding his own in a fire-fight with the Footwarriors (granted those guys couldn't run very fast), and by the end he steals the Heart of Gold with his girlfriend and swears a blood oath against Zaphod to avenge the destruction of Earth. Although he never gets to carry it out.
    -   He takes a while to come into the "coping and rationality" part of the trope; his initial reaction to the sight of the Vogon ships is to admit to Ford that he _can't_ cope with it, announcing that he'll "go and have a little lie down somewhere."
    -   Averted in the movie, where he can't handle any of the weird things going on, and comes close to _cracking_ quite a few times.
    -   In the books, he actually decides that he will go mad. And then he does. Although that was due more to loneliness than the weird, the weird still played a major part.
        -   "The weird" actually _ramps up_ somewhat at that point: Shortly after deciding to go mad, Arthur finds himself chasing a sofa across the fields of prehistoric Earth, which pleases him greatly at how well the madness thing seems to be going for him.
-   As concerns this trope in a sci-fi context, the Strugatsky brothers considerably predate Adams with their humorous novel _Monday Begins on Saturday_ and its programmer hero, Privalov. He is not fazed by the most fantastic event and doesn't see why he even should - which stands to reason since he works at the _Scientific_ Research Institute of Sorcery and Wizardry.
-   Jason Wood in _Digital Knight_. By the end of the book, he has fought, befriended, and had interaction with vampires, werewolves, demons, and basilisks. He even married a witch.
-   Jim in _Skunk Works_
-   Kit's older sister Carmela in the _Young Wizards_ series, though she's a secondary character who doesn't get much "screen time" until the later books.
    -   And then she jumps over to Badass Normal with a mail-order death ray.
-   Richard Mayhew in _Neverwhere_
-   Older Than Radio: Lemuel Gulliver from _Gulliver's Travels_. However, he does eventually crack and ends up a broken misanthrope after being rejected by the passionless horse-people in book four, who he looks up to despite their coldness and talk of genocide.
-   Bella Swan of the _Twilight_ saga. She figured out that Edward wasn't human and then decided that "It doesn't matter". Much to the chagrin of Edward himself. Since she was born with a special shield on her mind, that is not revealed till the end and is implied allows her to cope with weird stuff, Edward lampshades often enough how her reactions are not human, she might just be The Everyman. She also manages to bump into countless other vampires and werewolves, just because.
-   Bilbo Baggins in _The Hobbit_. He lives in a world well known to contain wizards, dragons, dwarfs and the like, but he, like most hobbits, has spent most of his life comfortably away from all that and is certainly dragged into it. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Sherlock Holmes_ Watson definitely.
-   The first of John Brunner's _The Traveller in Black_ stories has a 20th-century Londoner called Bernard Brown finding himself transported to the stories' setting of a far-distant past where magic still works. He makes his way to the nearest city where he gets treated as a god. He manages to defeat the _real_ god of a rival city by using the kind of calm and logical approach which the people of his adopted city prize most highly. It's fairly strongly implied, though never stated explicitly, that the Traveller brings Bernard to the city so that he will do precisely that, thereby sating a sudden mad desire on behalf of the people of the city to have a god — any god — and returning them to their normal level-headed ways.
-   Waldo Butters, in _The Dresden Files_. Well, he's a muggle who accepts the supernatural easily and hangs around with a powerful wizard who's always getting him into danger... his freakish love for polka might discount him from being considered "normal", exactly.
    -   As _Ghost Story_ he has left this to become Magical Batman Q and by the end of 'Skin Game'' he becomes a Jewish JediKnight of the frikking Cross
-   Lyra Volfrieds from _Black Dogs_. Starts out as an unathletic bookworm, wide-eyed and surprised at everything from dog soldiers to lesbians.
-   Rincewind the "Wizzard" of _Discworld_ fame. He is such a bad wizard that if he died, the per capita magical capacity of the Disc would go up. Despite his ineptitude, he has been to hell, heaven, Earth, the dawn of ages, the court of the fabulously rich and good-natured serif Creosote of Klatch, the court of the fabulously rich and Obliviously Evil emperor of Agatea, the abode of an Eldritch Abomination, the Dungeon Dimensions (from which the latter originally came), Death's Domain, and outer space, and not necessarily in that order. Although he _is_ a wizard, and can still, for example, see Octarine (he does not know the time of his death, but that is because his timeline is so screwed up that even _Death_ doesn't know, rather than any incompetence or tendency towards muggledom).
-   Newton Pulsifer from _Good Omens_ is a wages clerk turned witch-finder out of desperation for some excitement in his life. He eventually gets entangled in all matter of supernatural weirdness, up to and including The End of the World as We Know It.
-   Daniel in _Lonely Werewolf Girl_. Whether it is an angry werewolf or an upset fire demon he can be relied upon to have one constant response. Tea?
-   Faile in _The Wheel of Time_ is introduced as one of these. She gets more nuanced as the series progresses, but she is introduced as a normal person who just gets caught up with a cast of strange characters, much to her initial annoyance.
-   Alice in _Alice in Wonderland_ and _Through the Looking Glass_. Though her adventures regularly give her fairly concrete evidence that she's gone out of her skull, she takes it pretty well, given that her standard reaction is generally along the lines of "Golly, that's unusual", followed by a brief philosophical discussion with said unusual thing about whether or not she's objectively justified in considering it unusual.
-   The protagonist of _The Subject Steve_ pulls this off, despite a lack of supernatural elements in the book.
-   Shadow from _American Gods_.
    
    **Mr. Wednesday:** Why don't you argue? Why don't you exclaim that it's all impossible? Why the hell do you just do what I say and take it all so fucking calmly?
    
-   Shin-tsu, the protagonist of _The Longing of Shiina Ryo_, tries to convince himself of this every day.
-   David Wong and John Cheese from _John Dies at the End_ are Unfazed Everymen who come into contact with all kinds of weird shit because of the soy sauce and eventually become unaffected.
-   George Dorn from the _Illuminatus!_\-trilogy definitely qualifies: he gets recruited to the League of Dynamic Discord implicitly due to this quality, and promptly sent to deal with the International Crime Syndicate for a job vital to the safety of the human race after being member only for a day or two, and only getting a brief explanation for the goals and history of the organization. Though it's not directly stated, it's implied that Hagbard Celine does this because he wants a person who's mostly free even from the Discordian preconceptions to be his representative. In fact, most people in the Discordian organizations are like this when they first join.
-   Kamele Waitley from the later _Liaden Universe_ books by Sharon Lee & Steve Miller, who over the course of knowing Professor Jen Sar Kiladi goes from being a naive, cloistered ivory-tower academic (_Fledgling_, _Saltation_) to setting out to "rescue" Kiladi from Clan Korval but ending up rescuing _herself_ from the machinations of the Department of the Interior instead (_Ghost Ship_, _Dragon Ship_).
-   Coraline is an Unfazed Everygirl; admittedly, she does get scared (as who wouldn't) by things like a demonic "Other Mother" attempting to replace her eyes with buttons, but she always maintains a calm, even tone.

-   Ed from _The Tome of Bill_. Though he does react to the big things, he takes most everything else - including discovering that Bill is a vampire - in stride.
-   Comes up quite often in _Animorphs_, usually people whose cultures have myths of animals turning into humans (or vice versa). They don't seem all that concerned that a bunch of monkeys or seals or whatever turned into teenage humans.
-   Rachel Elizabeth Dare from _Percy Jackson_ is a human gifted with Sight (the ability to see through Mist which hides the Mystical). she eventually uses this sight to become the Oracle.
-   Dr. Dillingham, the protagonist of Piers Anthony's Prostho Plus, is a typical human dentist until he is abducted by a passing alien with a severe cavity. Despite being confronted with (and treating) hundreds or even thousands of aliens of absurd composition, his extreme unfazedness allows him to rise to become the Dean of the Galactic University of Dentistry.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Many of The Doctor's companions in _Doctor Who_. Ten, who loves pop culture, notably considers Arthur Dent a "nice chap".
    -   It has been lampshaded (in a rather dark way) that being one of The Doctor's companions turns you into a Badass Normal.
    -   One of the stand-out moments being in "Delta and the Bannermen". After an initial shriek of fright, Mel is seen nonchalantly sharing her room with Delta and her newly-hatched green alien baby.
    -   Rory Williams really wants to be this trope. By the time he reaches it, however, he's turned into an Empowered Badass Normal in the process.
        -   His dad, however, is. Brian Williams gets picked up by the Doctor by accident, and of course, is a little miffed at first. After that, he goes along with the Doctor not questioning anything.
    -   Clara is believably weirded out by her initial meetings with the Doctor, especially when she learns the truth about the TARDIS - all the more that the ship is shown and explained to her in a no-time-to-explain rush - but afterward, she's surprisingly nonchalant about the Doctor being an alien adventurer. Eleventh expresses a degree of surprise over her being "Okay with that.", sitting in a café and sipping a shake, as if she just hadn't made a weird acquaintance. In later series, Clara's can-do attitude actually becomes a problem. The Doctor openly worries he's encouraged her to become _too fearless_ and this in turn tempts her to become a cheery adventure junky in order to block out personal tragedies she's faced in her ordinary life. After they're both forced to part ways, Clara takes the trope to its logical conclusion, becoming an adventurer in her very own TARDIS, with her very own companion.
    -   Dan Lewis is your average working-class Liverpudlian - who gets kidnapped by a canine like alien. He seems more frustrated when he finds out the person who rescues him is from Sheffield than he is about being held in space against his will.
    -   Gwen Cooper in series 1 of _Torchwood_, and her husband Rhys Williams from series 2. In season 4, Gwen scares a CIA agent by being rather unfazed after a battle.
-   Marilyn in _The Munsters_. Of course, Marilyn has the distinct advantage of being raised by, well, monsters. She believes that monsters are completely normal, and that _she's_ the freak of the family.
-   John Watson from _Sherlock_. Yeah, every now and again his military and medical expertise comes in handy, but he's usually just a Badass Normal doctor; yet, he willingly follows along on bizarre and dangerous cases, and is probably the only person in the world who not only tolerates the Nightmare Fetishist Insufferable Genius that is Sherlock Holmes, but also considers him his best friend. That, and he's seen active service in Afghanistan, so Sherlock's eccentricities don't bother him. Much. He do however temporarily reaches his breaking point when Sherlock accidentally gets his wife Mary killed in the episode "The Six Thatchers". Kinda hard to stay unfazed about that.
    -   Mary too. Well, she _was_ an assassin, so Sherlock's weirdness doesn't freak her out.
    -   Same goes for Lestrade. Doubles as a Reasonable Authority Figure.
    -   Molly's also unfazed at Sherlock's weirdness but is normal, and the only one (other than John) to notice how stupid you can be to take drugs that are bad for your health.
-   John Crichton in _Farscape_, initially, though after a few years of being the universe's punching bag, he becomes Badass Normal on the grounds that whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. He may qualify as an evolved Unfazed Everyman after the Ancients unlock the wormhole knowledge in his brain. Wormhole technology is apparently the most powerful tool available to the major characters. By the end of the miniseries, he creates an exponentially expanding wormhole capable of destroying the entire Universe.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Xander
    -   Oz also had the potential for this before going all wolfie. His reaction to discovering the existence of the supernatural (though he did react like that to everything...):
        
        **Oz:** Yeah. Hey, did everybody see that guy just turn to dust?  
        **Willow:** Ohhh, well ... sort of.  
        **Xander:** Yep. Vampires are real. A lot of them live in Sunnydale. Willow will fill you in.  
        **Willow:** I know it's hard to accept at first.  
        **Oz:** Actually, it explains a _lot_.
        
    -   He has more of a reaction to Willow being with Xander than he does to:
        
        Helping find Buffy after she was turned into a rat, who then turns out to be naked when she's changed back.
        
        A student who's turned into Mr. Hyde wanting to kill him.
        
        Willow appearing to have become a vampire.
        
        Buffy gaining the ability to read his thoughts.
        
-   Stiles in _Teen Wolf_. Despite being one of the only humans in the central group, he's remarkably unfazed by all of the weird stuff around him and at times is even less surprised by supernatural things than the werewolves themselves.
    
    -   His only complaint about his best friend's werewolf transformations is that they're "very stressful" on him.
    
    **Scott:** I swear, I don't have the urge to maim and kill you.  
    **Stiles:** You know, you say that now. But then the full moon goes up and out come the fangs and the claws and there's a lot of howling and screaming and running everywhere, okay? It's very stressful on me! So yes, I'm still locking you up.
    
-   Ando Masahashi from _Heroes_ was one for a while, but eventually he got powers of his own.
    -   HRG's wife and Claire's adoptive mother, Sandra Bennett, seems to have adapted to her daughter having superpowers and her husband being an all-purpose spook rather well, all things considered.

-   Kaoru from _GARO_. She is more affected by Kouga carrying her back to her flat after she was knocked out than being caught in the middle of a fight between a golden warrior and monster the man she spoke to just a moment ago turned into.
-   Matt from _The Vampire Diaries_
-   Sheriff Carter from _Eureka_ qualifies for this trope most of the time, though he generally has to rise to badass level by the climax of the episode.
-   Harper from _Wizards of Waverly Place_ at least after she finds out about the Russo's secret. Also Theresa.
-   Frank Lapidus on _Lost_, a recurring character introduced in season four (and later made a regular for season six). He doesn't have any connection to the story or mythology, and his only personal problem (being a drunk) was dealt with before he arrived. He's possibly the only normal, well-adjusted person to ever set foot on the Island...and also accepts all the weird crap that happens on it without question.
-   Joel, Mike and Jonah from _Mystery Science Theater 3000_. Escape attempts aside, they're all weirdly accepting of being the subjects of mad scientists' experiments, the bizarre antics of their robot friends, and the colorful movie character who keep dropping in.
-   Wendy from _The Middleman_ was hired for her cynical, snarky attitude and matter-of-fact reactions to things like the eyeball monster.
-   _Stargate SG-1_: Burke from Season 7 _Evolution_. A CIA field officer stationed in Honduras, he's not part of the Stargate program and has no knowledge of any of the aliens and advanced technology the heroes deal with every day. This doesn't slow him down one bit when O'Neill enlists him to help track down Daniel, Lee, and a Goa'uld artifact that reanimates dead tissue. When faced with what is for all intents and purposes a zombie and seeing that O'Neill's bullets have no effect on it, he simply blows it away with a grenade launcher. Even the fact that he's never given any context for what he just saw doesn't seem to bother him.
    
    **Burke**: What's with the guy from _Evil Dead_?
    
    **O'Neill**: Uh...
    
    **Burke**: Classified?
    
    **O'Neill**: ... yeah.
    
    **Burke**: You guys are into some crazy crap, man!
    
-   Sheriff Jody Mills from _Supernatural_ who fights the supernatural even though she is not trained as a hunter.
-   _Smallville_: Dr. Emil Hamilton had this vibe. Sure, he comes into the series as the team's medic who Oliver trusts enough to operate on Martian Manhunter (who, as his name suggests, is _from Mars_), but despite that it's still remarkable how many things get very little reaction from him, if they get any at all. For example, in "Rabid," he is supersped by Clark to a location halfway across town, has to deal with a Zombie Apocalypse, and finds out that a friend of his is an alien that is at least in some way similar to a guy who was a horrific _Serial Killer_, and he is _completely unconcerned_.
-   _Bewitched_ has side character Abner Kravitz. While his wife, Gladys, sees all of the kooky supernatural goings-on and freaks out, Abner is completely nonchalant about the whole thing. When he hears there is a chess-playing horse in at the Stephens's house, Abner brings over a chess set to challenge it.
-   Kolya Gerasimov (Alexei Fomkin) in Soviet Sci-Fi classic _Guest from the Future_ is an Ordinary High-School Student who one day accidentally winds up 100 years in the future. He does pretty well, given how confused he is.

    Podcasts 

-   This seems to be the mindset of everyone that lives in Night Vale. Even Carlos eventually got used to the town's weirdness, as shown in "Lazy Day", where he takes advantage of everyone and everything (including body organs and _gravity itself_) lazying off by doing various household chores (including cleaning out his gutters while gravity was gone).
-   _Unwell Podcast_: Of all the three characters of the show that move to Mount Absolom (Abbie, Lily, and Rudy), Rudy adapts to the supernatural perhaps the best - he willingly accepts the existence of ghosts and even befriends Norah easily, and frequently points out to Abby that there's no logical explanation for some of the things they've seen, like The Lonely Door that appears in the Fenwood House.
-   Dr. Jared Hel from _Jar of Rebuke_ often seems to be unfazed by the horrors they face in their cryptozoological work, finding themselves far more bothered by day-to-day stresses like public speaking and surprise parties. Though being easily resurrected probably takes off some of the edge.

    Role-Playing Games 

-   Andrew of _Dino Attack RPG_ is just your average civilian who hangs out with Laxus and Pterisa while fighting an apocalyptic war against Mutant Dinosaurs, all without so much as raising an eyebrow.

    Video Games 

-   In _Friday Night Funkin',_ Boyfriend will always maintain the same cocky expression no matter the situation or who he is up against. Even if some of his opponents are actually trying to _kill_ him or Girlfriend, he will continue to sing as if nothing was out of the ordinary. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Johnny Cage is this for the first story mode chapter of _Mortal Kombat 9_, by way of being the most relatively normal kombatant.

-   Derek Badger, unflappable Yorkshireman and protagonist of Ben Croshaw's _Poacher_. Not even a tumble down the proverbial rabbit hole into a world of spirits and monsters can shake him.
-   Conway, the first player character in _Kentucky Route Zero_, is a delivery truck driver who's absolutely unaffected by the supernatural happenings around him. Such is the nature of Magic Realism.
-   Dudley from _Street Fighter_ plays the role in _Street Fighter X Tekken_. Elena shows up on his doorstep and tells him that a tree in Dudley's garden has told her about a great danger, so they must go to the South Pole and stop it. Dudley's reaction? It's all right, he'll help her in her quest, as long as he's back home in time for his next boxing match.
-   Some players in _Nexus Clash_ choose to reject the Good, Evil, _and_ Neutral Powers That Be and remain Mortal for their entire existence. This is generally considered a form of Self-Imposed Challenge but some characters that do this are surprisingly effective.
-   _Outer Wilds_: Gabbro spends the entire game lying in a hammock and playing a flute, despite the fact that the island they're on frequently gets thrown into space by a cyclone. Even after they become aware that they're stuck in a "Groundhog Day" Loop that ends with the sun exploding, they don't really care.
    
    **Gabbro:** So hey, don't freak out or anything, but lately I keep, like, dying repeatedly. I dunno, it's pretty weird. What about you? Have you died lately, or is it just me?  
    **Hatchling:** No, it's me, too. We're in a time loop.  
    **Gabbro:** Time _has_ been behaving unusually lately. Yeah, a time loop makes sense. Cool.
    
-   Heather in _Silent Hill 3_ doesn't start off this way, but she gradually adapts to the horrors she encounters throughout the story until she just shrugs at it like it was an everyday thing. She doesn't even flinch after finding out that she's the reincarnation of Alessa, who was the daughter of the antagonist from the first game and said antagonist was also the mother of the current antagonist in this game.
-   Provided he survives the opening, Fergus Reid of _Wolfenstein: The New Order_ gradually becomes so Seen It All that not only does he give the page quote, but he only reacts with mild bemusement as a set of Powered Armor slowly works its way up his legs.

    Webcomics 

-   Dad Egbert from _Homestuck_. As the only naturally born human in the comic he was never destined to play a part in Sburb at all. His involvement in the game and very existence seems to be a complete accident.
-   Moloch von Zinzer of _Girl Genius_ is an ordinary mechanic and soldier fallen on hard times, who against his best wishes, keeps getting caught up with Mad Scientists of all flavors, to quote "I've been around way too many sparks!" Even when he _tries_ to stay out of the way ("I'm nobody's happy helper, got it?!"), he's clearly minion material, as he immediately accepts the job of carrying the Sparky heroine's tools and (unwillingly) following her through death traps.
    -   Although sparks have a natural, almost supernatural charisma that makes anyone not Badass Normal into a willing (or in Moloch's case, unwilling) helper. Especially with Agatha, who is one of the most powerful sparks in the series.
    -   Airman Higgs at first seemed to be one of these - a common soldier being hauled along after a group of very important people and managing to maintain _some_ degree of detachment. He's actually a subversion, though, as bit by bit he has revealed various superhuman abilities. He is _incredibly_ durable, superhumanly strong and quick, personally acquainted with Castle Heterodyne, and turns out to be not only a Jagergeneral, but one of the ORIGINAL Jagers created by Vlad the Blasphemous.
-   Trevor Savage from _EVIL_ is just your average slacker, with no special skills or powers and no real penchant for evildoing, surrounded by mad scientists, magic users, psychics, and criminal masterminds.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, although she wants to be in her friends' league, Sarah has been from the start a mostly-ordinary human with a matter-of-fact attitude toward all the weirdness surrounding her.
    
    **Sarah:** Thanks, but I'm really not that cool. I just have some experience with this sort of thing...
    
    -   Elliot's parents have a complete non-reaction to learning that due to a magical misadventure they now have a fully grown daughter in addition to a son.
-   _Digger_, of the Ursula Vernon webcomic of the same name, is an anthropomorphic wombat who manages to be an Unfazed Everyman thanks to the sheer weirdness of the rest of the characters. In fact, this is practically Digger's racial superpower: wombats are so sensible and tied to realism rather than faith or magic that they gain a mild immunity from divine/magical/prophetic dealings.
-   Torg and Zoe from _Sluggy Freelance_ play this role most of the time. True, Torg _does_ have a magic sword, and Zoe's got the cursed tattoo that occasionally turns her into a camel. But compared to the Mad Scientists, witches, Aliens, and Talking Animals they hang out with, they're downright mundane (though Torg does occasionally enter Badass Normal territory, generally by way of being a Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass).
-   Bob Smithson in _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_. has been an Unfazed Everyman since the beginning, and has gradually been turning into an Evolved Unfazed Everyman as he becomes more and more capable.
-   Susan (Susie) Bell in _I Was Kidnapped by Lesbian Pirates from Outer Space!!!_, though it is revealed that she is a lesbian, despite not being the princess or having antennae.
-   Saya and Jason from _Emergency Exit_. Saya has a toy laser gun that shoots people, and Jason grew up in a circus — which is handier in combat than you might think.
-   Sam of _Sam & Fuzzy_. The poor sap is a walking Weirdness Magnet.
    
    **Sam:** I was once like you...I had no idea there was an entire world of weird stuff out there. But then, bit by bit, my life got caught up in it. Soon, just dealing with it was practically a full-time job!  
    **Devahi:** What did you do?  
    **Sam:** I made dealing with it my full-time job.  
    **Fuzzy:** Here's our card!
    

-   Red from _Girls in Space_ is a normal human, traveling the universe, surrounded by aliens.
-   Marten and his friends in _Questionable Content_ seem to be Weirdness Magnets getting involved with anything from mating vacuuming robots, to government agents looking to take away Pintsize, to a Vespa riding vigilante and a parallel world coffee shop. And that's not counting the accepted breaks from the world as we know it such as talking small robots.
-   Dave in _Narbonic_. At least until he goes mad at the end.
-   _What's New? with Phil and Dixie_ had fun with roleplayers being so jaded one would merely turn into an Ascended Fanboy if something weird really happens.
    
    **A Gamer:** _\[to a big frog alien from whom everyone else flees in panic\]_ Have a nice trip?
    

-   While having an identity crisis, Kronos from _Wayward Sons_ befriends a family of feudal Chinese peasants, and brings them back to the spaceship to meet his crew. The father of the family, Huang, seems considerably less worried about the monstrous-looking aliens than he was about local (human) warlords, and his bio notes that he's good at finding things he can relate to about them and makes friends easily.
-   Oscar, the main character in _Wilde Life_, isn't completely unfazed by the weirdness around him, but he gets over each revelation in a couple of pages. As far as we can tell, he's completely normal himself.
-   _Whither_ has Alex, an amateur Occult Detective who doesn't bat an eye at the weird. He does, however, take pictures.
-   _Erma_ has Sam Williams, Erma's father and Emiko's husband. He is completely unfazed by his wife and daughter's supernatural antics (apart from the property damage Erma's causes), and is perfectly comfortable palling around with Emiko's brother and his bar buddies, not even flinching when, in order, Emiko's sister tries to kill him, a random yokai bar patron tries to _eat_ him, and then he's given a virtue test in the form of wine that poisons untrustworthy people, which he passes. May have hints of Badass Normal, since he implied that he had the means and intention of defending himself from being eaten by the bar yokai before being saved by the jorungoro.

    Web Original 

-   Bee of _Bee and Puppycat_ has a tendency to under-react to events that would freak out lots of people. The most she gets fazed is frustrated groaning when a letter magically appears out of nowhere. Upon reading it, and seeing it offers her new pet cat and/or dog temp work, she offers to get him a pen to sign the letter.
-   Discussed in Allison Pregler's _Charmed_ reviews:
-   CollegeHumor's "Horror Movie Daycare" sketch relies on this for a lot of its humor. The daycare hosts children from _The Shining_, _The Ring_, _Rosemary's Baby_... and the teacher is a cheerful, upbeat young woman who doesn't even bat an eye at all the supernatural weirdness that comes with her job. In a way, it's actually quite sweet to see her treating the little hellions like ordinary children, and she clearly loves the kids. To be fair, she does look a little creeped out during the alphabet singing activity, where the kids use inhuman voices to sing, but she doesn't let it bother her. Based on her work history (a nurse in a youth mental hospital, which burned down, then a governess in an old orphanage, which also burned down), it appears she has been adequately prepared for her current position and even knows how to properly read the Necronomicon.
-   Arguably, Bowser from SuperMarioLogan is like this. Despite his violence to Junior, he's relatively unfazed about some things. For example, in the "Home Alone 2" video, upon seeing the bodies on the robbers that Junior killed, he responds with, "Alright, just make sure you clean up after." In "Sicken", Cody tries to kill him, due to Junior killing his doll/boyfriend, Ken, however, it is unsuccessful.
    
    **Junior:** Dad! Dad! Just run! Run away! \[\[Cody\]\] tried to kill you! Just run!  
    **Bowser:** Okay. _\[walks away\]_
    

    Western Animation 

-   Finn from _Adventure Time_, due to being the former last human in his time, spends his time with his magical stretching dog, Jake, a vampire, candy, and other wacky things.
-   Sokka from _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ is this being the only non-bender in the group (before Suki joined mid-season 3) and actually coped quite well thanks to meat and sarcasm. It helped that he had a clear niche as The Smart Guy and The Strategist; he can't manipulate the elements, but most of the team can't read a map.
-   Ben and Gwen Tennyson in the original _Ben 10_, pilot episode. In fact, they only freak out for a couple of minutes, as Ben had turned into a living candle and had accidentally started a forest fire. After Grandpa Max explained that Ben was an alien they calmed down quickly.
    -   Julie Yamamoto in _Ben 10: Alien Force_, while she only finds out in the last 5-10 minutes of the episode she found out in. She had caught Ben in his Jet-ray mode and when questioned she said she thought it was "cool". And then she gets a pet that doubles as a Cool Ship.
-   In _The Fairly Oddparents_, the Poorly Disguised Pilot for Crash Nebula reveals the eponymous hero was like this once: the only human in an intergalactic school. Once he gets the powerful space suit he begins to get less so.
-   Philip J. Fry from _Futurama_, although it takes him a while to cope with the weirdness. Once he does, he realizes that he probably never really belonged in the 21st Century anyway. Best summed up by his speech to Leela when she gets plastic surgery for a second eye:
    
    **Fry:** What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg: He's a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.  
    **Zoidberg:** Damn right!  
    **Fry:** And the Professor's a senile, amoral crackpot.  
    _\[Farnsworth blubbers and waves.\]_  
    **Fry:** Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.  
    **Hermes:** Tally me banana.  
    **Fry:** Amy's a klutz from Mars.  
    _\[Amy drops the glass she is drinking from and it smashes.\]_  
    **Amy:** Sploops!  
    **Farnsworth:** And, Fry, you've got that brain thing.  
    **Fry:** I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?
    
    -   Although the fact that he was conceived as his own grandfather giving him no delta brainwaves, and deliberately sent into the future by Nibbler specifically because of this may disqualify him.
-   _Gargoyles_ has the father of David Xanatos, who meets Goliath and Demona before being taken on a time travel trip a thousand years. Dude never even blinks at the crazy stuff he sees.
    -   Elisa counts as well, she's a normal cop in the NYPD who keeps up with the stuff she and the clan are up against.
-   _Gravity Falls_:
    -   In the whole town of Gravity Falls, OR, there is only one citizen who is unaffected by the chaos. One pillar of emotional strength who remains stoic in the face of danger. One person who lets none of the monsters get her down. That person is… Soos' grandmother. In the episode "Soos and the Real Girl", we find that she'd been following Soos' date, even when a Yandere AI was running amuck. When Weirdmageddon rolls around and turns her into a talking easy chair, she just tells Soos he should go out and help his friends, then reclines to take a nap.
    -   She is nothing compared to the normal-est man in town, Tad Strange. His reaction to being petrified by the Big Bad and used as a building block in a "throne of human agony" is, upon being unfrozen, to calmly state that he's probably been scarred forever by the experience.
-   Depending on the Writer, the title character of _Jimmy Two-Shoes_ fills this role when he's not being The Fool. Despite being a relative newcomer and Fish out of Water in Miseryville, Jimmy doesn't usually take much notice in the town's oddities, its demonic citizens, or how much of a Crapsack World it is.
-   _Milo Murphy's Law_: Melissa has been friends with Milo long enough to get used to the bizarre disasters caused by "Murphy's Law".
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Over time, the citizens of Ponyville start to get used to the hijinks that occur thanks to the proximity of the main characters. Twilight Sparkle and her friends preoccupied with a monster attack? The locals are more concerned with how this is going to affect an upcoming wedding. Magical Hate Plague causes you to go nuts and attack someone? Meh, it had been a slow day anyway.
-   Candace in _Phineas and Ferb_. In spite of her neurotic tendencies, she has seen so many astounding things over the course of the show that they rarely surprise her anymore. Particularly in later seasons, there's an ironic trend for her to remain relatively calm in real crises, in contrast to her typical overreacting.
    -   This conversation between Phineas and Candace in Season 4 showcases this trend perfectly.
        
        **Phineas:** It's me, Candace. Phineas! Outer-space alien super-crooks from a planet of frogs and reptiles have taken over our bodies.  
        **Candace:** _\[completely straight-faced\]_ Okay. What do you want me to do?  
        **Phineas:** Really? You believe that weird story just like that?  
        **Candace:** _\[still completely straight-faced\]_ Yeah. It's been a long summer, kid. What do you need?
        
    -   An even better example is her Understanding Boyfriend Jeremy, who gets a front-row seat to both Phineas and Ferb's crazy antics and Candace's attempts to bust them and just rolls with all of it.
-   Superintendent Chalmers from _The Simpsons_. As noted by Word of God, he's probably the only relatively normal guy in Springfield, but he survives by simply pretending not to notice the insanity around him. Contrast with Frank Grimes, who's inability to cope with the Dysfunction Junction that is Springfield ultimately causes his death.
-   This is how Stan manages to cope living in _South Park_. The entire town is a Weirdness Magnet and his father is perhaps the most insane in a town of people with multiple personalities, illiterates, Knight Templar Parents, the son of the devil, a Depraved Bisexual teacher and Eric Cartman. Despite all this, he usually watches on unfazed by what is happening this week other than to pinch the bridge of his nose.
    
    -   Craig is this in the _Pandemic_ two-part special. Not only does he spend the _entire episode_ completely jaded and unfazed by being shipped to Peru by the US Government, facing giant guinea pigs, and being the chosen one destined to defeat the guinea pirate, but he also constantly lampshades the weirdness and criticizes Stan and his friends for constantly getting involved in these things, culminating in this _legendary_ summary of the episodes which he says in complete deadpan seriousness:
    
    **Craig:** My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains. Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed. All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen. The guinea pirate lived but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days. And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security. My parents were sooo happy. I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us. We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money.
    
-   Connie from _Steven Universe_, she's a little shocked when she learns new things about the Gems sometimes but her shock always lasts about 0.02 seconds. A good example being when Lapis Lazuli steals the ocean, Connie doesn't know about Lapis's ability to attack with water-doppelgangers and has never fought with the Gems before, but she runs right in anyway and even saves Steven when the tower falls.
-   The humans in all series of _Transformers._ They exist to _not_ be awesome next to all of the cool robots. In fact, the most annoying humans have been some of the ones designated to be more equal to the Transformers themselves. Except for Sari, but she's unusual.
    -   However, the fleshies of _Transformers: Prime_ seem to hold up quite well next to their co-stars, as each has perpetrated his/her fair share of badassery.
-   Mark from _Ugly Americans_ could probably out-Unfaze Everyman Arthur Dent. In the first episode, he's already sharing an apartment with a zombie, and dating a succubus who is also his boss. He works at New York's Department of Integration, where he helps immigrants adapt to American society, and monsters adapt to human society. It's basically a Fantasy Kitchen Sink, with vampires, demons, wizards, and robots, but also weirder stuff like landwhales and man birds.
-   Triana Orpheus of _The Venture Bros._ is for the most part a normal teenage girl in a setting filled with all manner of outlandish characters and over-the-top personalities, and she usually just ignores the insanity around her. This ended up getting her Put on a Bus after season 4, since her very dry, aloof nature made it difficult to write jokes around her. Triana's dad, Dr. Byron Orpheus, made for a much better Straight Man in that regard.

    Real Life 

-   New York City is notorious for this, and for good reason. Loki is invading a Starbucks? Not even enough to get the locals to stop checking their smartphones<small>◊</small>. And this wasn't even on a day with a con nearby!
    -   The residents of other densely populated metropolitan areas can adopt a similar mindset.
-   When there's any kind of convention or gathering (such as cosplay) that involves people in costumes wandering around, non-participants generally fall into one of three categories — the people who are accustomed to it; the people who openly gawk at the weirdos in costumes; and the people who determinedly ignore the whole thing.
-   In University towns and cities, on any given night, you can determine who's a local, who's a student, and who's not from the area by their reaction to a group of students in fancy dress. The locals have Seen It All, the students wonder what the occasion is, and the out-of-towners openly gawk.
-   Similarly, it's said you can tell who's a foreigner and who's not at Sinterklaas parades in the Netherlands that feature performers disguised as Zwarte Piet ("Black Pete"). That is, mischievous clown figures in Blackface, imitating the folk character who (to the Dutch, at least), is Sinterklaas' black servant. Since the Netherlands has always had a very small black population, and since Europeans don't tend to associate characters like Zwarte Piet with racial inferiority, nobody complained that the parades were offensive until quite recently, and even then there was massive backlash when the Piets were made up in all different colors to avoid being offensive. Among the crowds lining the streets for these parades, the Dutch are the ones smiling, laughing, or just passively taking in the spectacle. The foreigners - _especially_ the Americans - are the ones with their jaws on the ground.
-   During filming for _Star Trek IV_ the director was somewhat disappointed that the locals didn't even _blink_ at the actors wandering around in strange uniforms. It wasn't even during filming, it was prior to filming, and it was non-actors in the full Starfleet "Red Jacket" uniforms. Of course they **weren't** strange uniforms. They were probably recognized as being _Star Trek_ uniforms and then not given a second glance.
