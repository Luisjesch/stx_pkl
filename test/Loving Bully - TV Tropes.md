You sometimes hurt the ones you love.

When someone bullies someone else because they have a crush on them. This is usually because they aren't sure how to convey their feelings properly or are so overwhelmed by their feelings they have a hard time getting them out. Often the bully is a Tsundere.<sup>Note&nbsp;</sup>  The target of the bullying is generally under the impression that the bully is simply mean and has no clue the bully has a crush on them.

This is generally Played for Laughs and won't normally get into serious violence unless the target is Made of Iron. This sometimes overlaps with Double Standard: Abuse, Female on Male. Romanticized Abuse and Domestic Abuse are the significantly less innocent Sister Tropes, and Fetishized Abuser is the Darker and Edgier one. An extreme form is Lacerating Love Language, when affection is expressed not just through hostility but through outright violence. Contrast Mad Love, a generally comedic trope wherein the one in love cannot figure out that abuse is _not_ the sign that their beloved returns their affections. Romantic variations of the Fair-Weather Foe might _claim_ they were actually this to manipulate an enemy into getting with them.

If the bully eventually changes their ways, this becomes Reformed Bully or Bully Turned Buddy.

Truth in Television for some small children who lack the concept of relationships and _usually_ grow out of it.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Semimaru from _7 Seeds_ starts off as a regular bully, teasing everyone but Natsu especially. He later mellows out and his teasing is definitely more good-natured when Natsu begins to improve herself and Semimaru falls for her.
-   Tamayo and Kotaro's relationship in the anime version of _Angelic Layer_ falls into this, as well as Childhood Friend Romance. They had known each other since they were four, and Tamayo had been using Kotaro as her go-to target to practice her martial moves on, to his utmost annoyance. However, during the Beach Episode, Tamayo confesses that she is in love with Kotaro and that he's her first love. In the manga, though, Tamayo and Kotaro's relationship is completely platonic, and Kotaro ends up with Misaki.
-   In one FAQ of _Bleach_ Rukia says that _someone_ was a schmuck towards her in the Shinigami school because he couldn't tell her his feelings. Unsurprisingly, chapter -17 (a bonus chapter) seems to indicate that that someone was Renji. They end up married in the epilogue.
-   In _Bokura no Hentai_, a bully mocks pre-transition Marika and calls her "gay" in a derogatory way. After she comes back to school as a girl, he still mocks her and thinks she's "disgusting" but he begins crushing on her.
-   Played for Drama in _Boy's Abyss_. Reiji's Childhood Friend Gen started abusing him relentlessly as they became teenagers, but it's quickly revealed that he's a yandere for him.
-   _Boys over Flowers_: As Tsukasa develops feelings for Tsukushi, he thinks of more ways to bully her. Obviously, she doesn't get the hint.
-   Deconstructed in _Daily Lives of High School Boys_: Habara was a feared bully known as "Archdemon" who terrorized every boy in her neighborhood, but especially Toshiyuki Karasawa, her next-door neighbor, eventually giving him _several_ large scars that would never go away. Fast forward eight years, and it becomes clear that she harbors a small crush on Karasawa, who, unfortunately for her, is traumatized by her bullying to the point where he can barely interact with her normally.
-   In _Digimon Ghost Game_, Kiyoshiro's tsundere partner Jellymon acts like this towards him, bullying him relentlessly for his cowardice and forcing him to use the _\-sama_ honorific with her but gives him the Affectionate Nickname of "Darling".
-   The main concept of _Don't Toy with Me, Miss Nagatoro_, with the main character being the target of the titular underclassman's affections, with their initial interactions ending with him _breaking down in tears_. There's more emphasis on the bullying in the original webcomic, where Nagatoro is a straight-up sadist, while the later serialization tones it down to make it closer to teasing, with her toning it down when he's noticeably enraged.

-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_: Subverted with Anko, who bullied Noboru before falling in love with him, and stopped her abuse after Onizuka helped her uncover her true feelings.
-   The unnamed couple in Natsuneko's one-shot manga _Her Desire_, with a twist that the bullied girl actually likes it that way.
-   Youdou from _I Belong to the Baddest Girl at School_ has had a crush on Unoki since grade school, but she mostly shows her love through bullying and pulling mean-spirited pranks on him. In her case, she doesn't do it because she's struggling to understand or express her feelings for him properly, she's just a sadist who gets off on watching him squirm. Either way, her actions have only made Unoki afraid of her and destroyed any chances of the two of them actually becoming a couple. She does realise this, but as she admits later, she can't stop herself because she's worried that if she ever moved on or if Unoki ever forgave her, the two of them would no longer have anything keeping them together.
-   _K-On!_: Ritsu is a platonic (or not) version of this trope towards Mio; Ritsu is often teasing, scaring, and pushing Mio past what she can tolerate, but it's made clear time and time again that she cares for Mio and wants her to stop being so afraid of everything.
-   This is how Seo acts towards Wakamatsu in _Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun_. He noticed she specifically targets him by throwing the ball at his face, stalking him at lunchtime, making him buy her things and carry her stuff...to then taking him to a diner and buying _him_ some food and even _buying him some souvenirs_. Nozaki immediately can tell that she likes him.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: Asuka's mistreatment of Shinji is an example of this that's very definitely _not_ Played for Laughs. Keeping with the Deconstruction theme that the series is famous for, an inability to express attraction in any other way is treated very seriously, with all the sadness and horror such a mental state implies.
-   Yuki Katsura in _Oku-sama wa Mahou Shoujo_, the leader of the two bullies at school, is really just acting on an immature crush, but he learns to show it a little better later on. Ultimately, he pretty much saves Wonderland by confessing to Cruje.
-   In _Onihime VS_, Arima and her girl posse relentlessly bully and molest poor Setsuna...because Arima is in love with him. It's exactly as messed up as it sounds.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   Nurse Joy from _Pokémon: The Original Series_ suggests this about Ash and Misty.
        
        "What's the saying? You only hurt the ones you love."
        
    -   In _Pokémon the Series: XY_, Serena's Mirror Universe counterpart takes this approach with Shrinking Violet Alternate Ash, bullying him for being a crybaby while still clearly enjoying his company.
-   Deconstructed in _Trash Skill Gacha_: Ellis Rifeld is Crest Bahurst's fiancée at the beginning of the story and loves him... but regularly humiliates him, spreads Malicious Slander about him to destroy his reputation and keep everyone from approaching him, and when she learns his school-appointed sparring partner is Minuet Mycelin, she ramps up what she does to poor Crest because of her jealousy. This causes Crest to greatly resent and hate her, to the point that, when she offers to save him from exile to the \[Lower World\] (an execution in all but name) in exchange of becoming her slave, he spits on her and tells her to go screw herself, choosing death over having to deal with her for one more minute.
-   _Urusei Yatsura_: Subverted with Ryoko and Tobimaro. Ryoko has been pranking and tormenting Tobimaro with cruel and dangerous pranks since childhood, yet also claims to be in love with him, usually causing her brother, Mendo, to beat up Tobimaro. It's not clear if she's serious about her "love" for him, since she's a notably sadistic Bitch in Sheep's Clothing, has said the same thing about other people her brother dislikes such as Ataru, and once said how she loves Tobimaro... in pain. This is further parodied in that despite Tobimaro being consistently and openly terrified of Ryoko, most of the characters in the story think it's romantic.
-   _Venus Puts Fur On Me_ has its "heroine", Shirosaki Hana, as a very twisted version of this. Behind closed doors, she's a violent, sadistic jerk to one boy, Nakajima, in particular, and harms him whenever things don't go her way. "Her way", surprisingly, is _getting gratuitous bullying and public humiliation_, courtesy of _him_, just so she can be happy. The story implies more than once that her aggressively sadomasochistic tendencies are her way of processing a crush on the boy, with several arcs devoted to her trying to get him out of reach of other girls like her as he is _her_ toy.
-   _Wandering Son_:
    -   Played with. Doi doesn't bully Nitori because he likes her, he bullies her because she's feminine. This doesn't stop him from being attracted to her once she grows her hair out though. By high school, the attraction disappeared over time as Nitori became increasingly masculine-looking.
    -   Early on, Anna would tease and make fun of Nitori. This is implied to be due to her Sugar-and-Ice Personality. Later they become the Official Couple and Anna's negative aspects disappear.
-   _You and Me_:
    -   Masaki is older than the norm but still counts. After Shun gives her a bandage for her scrapped knee, Masaki spends the rest of the second episode bullying him. They eventually become friends.
    -   When the boys work at a kindergarten, they meet a brash boy with a crush on his classmate. She's Oblivious to Love while he is something of a bully towards her.

    Comic Books 

-   In _The Umbrella Academy_, Diego is sharp with everyone, but especially Vanya, who broke up with him a few years ago. Since Vanya is no gentle flower herself, any conversation between them inevitably degrades into a deadlock of insults and hurt feelings like the one that pushed Vanya off the edge into evil. (To be fair, this is not entirely Diego's fault.)

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Calvin and Hobbes_, Calvin does this to Susie from time to time. Hobbes calls him on it but Calvin claims he really does hate her. This is coupled with Author Appeal due to how well the characters bounce off each other due to the "weirdness repels" dynamic. Calvin acts weird to get Susie's attention, Susie's repulsed by it, and Calvin takes this as a cue to act even stranger.
-   _Crabgrass_: In a Valentines day-related arc starting with this comic, Maxine, the local school bully, seemingly falls in love with Kevin, something Kevin is naturally uncomfortable about. Ultimately subverted, however; she gave him the wrong card and is actually in love with another Kevin.
-   Linus in _Peanuts_ once told Charlie Brown about meeting a cute girl once. He claimed that he was so nervous around her that he couldn't think of anything to say...so he opted to hit her instead.

    Fan Works 

-   _Apprentice and Pregnant_: Firepaw freely admits that he bickers with Laurelpaw because he honestly doesn't know any way of communicating with her.
-   _Back to Zero_: As kids, Butch would tease Jessie and try to get her attention because he had a crush on her. Jessie didn't like this and thought it was a silly way of showing that you liked someone.
-   In _Candy For Your Thoughts?,_ Cody, desperate to get Sierra off his back, claims that Noah has a crush on her and that his snarky comments amount to this trope. He mentally adds that no one over the age of ten actually acts that way, but Sierra is willing to believe it. The fic ends with a Maybe Ever After for Noah and Sierra.
-   _Do You Believe in Fairies?_ deconstructs how Candace and Julius are canonically portrayed as an Energetic and Soft-Spoken Duo in _Harvest Moon: Animal Parade_. Julius' bullying left her with a severe stutter that worsens when she gets nervous, along with being cripplingly shy. In addition, he never quite grew out of this, still invading her personal space and offering up insulting critiques. As a result, she can't _stand_ being around him.
-   In _Friendship is Witchcraft_, Diamond Tiara hides her crush on Apple Bloom by bullying her.
-   _In A Sky Of A Million Stars_: It's implied Katsuki's bullying of Izuku was veering into this. This is deconstructed, as Izuku reciprocated his feelings but didn't know those feelings existed; therefore, having the object of his affections treat him so badly only helped further his depression.
-   _Hater Good Side Story Swayed Decisions_, a _Breadwinners_ and _Pickle and Peanut_ crossover: Sophee pranks and insults SwaySway because she has a crush on him, but while he admits he had minor feelings for her as well, they shouldn't be together because she's being so cruel.
-   _The Pieces Lie Where They Fell_: Diamond Back, as Wind Breaker finds out late in the story.
-   Giselle in _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_ is a downplayed example towards Joe. She's not shown bullying him directly but encourages the rest of her class to apply Tough Love on him to get him to improve his performance (they're considered the "Golden Generation" and he's the dead last). Ultimately, the way they treated Joe drove him to quit the school and find his own path, which greatly saddened her because she actually liked him.
-   _A Possible Encounter for a Phantom_: Bonnie picks on Danny and treats him rudely in an effort to hide how she's secretly crushing on him.
-   In _The Wound's Still Bleeding_, 10-year-old Kakashi begins picking on her teammate Obito so that Obito will notice her more. Even if it's negative attention, it's still attention to her.
-   In episode 55 of _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_, Kaiba claims that he is this to his little brother.
-   Mentioned in _Zelda and the Manacle of Cahla_; Zelda's adoptive cousin Amir has made her miserable since they were kids because he's jealous that his grandmother appears to favour her and he hates Hylians, but Zelda's friend Iona considers Amir has a crush on her. Zelda's response? "Or he's just a bully."

Pignon's lack of interest visibly upsets him. After his divorce, he asks Pignon to be his housemate for practical reasons, but when Pignon refuses, he starts such an Unstoppable Rage he has to be restrained and sent to a hospital.

    Literature 

-   _Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan_: All of the violence, torture, and death that Dokuro inflicts on poor Sakura is her way of showing affection.

In her article, she attributes his belief that bullying is an acceptable way to express romantic feelings to toxic masculinity.

In fact, the ones he picks on most he also seems oddly fond of - Shuichi is one of the few people he comes to genuinely respect since Shuichi solves the murders and finds the truth behind each case and attempts to "recruit" him to his organisation, he spends a lot of time Slut-Shaming and insulting Miu while well-aware she likes being treated that way, provides her alibi in the second trial and respects her talent as the Ultimate Inventor enough to come to her with several blueprints, and forces Himiko to confront her repressed emotions about Tenko's death and even claims he "loves" her at one point (which Himiko lampshades by commenting a boy will often act mean to a girl he likes).

This comes to a boiling point when Craig, finally fed up, calls her out on her hypocritical attitude towards people, considering she's human herself. After seeing where her behavior has gotten her, she later apologizes to him and makes an active effort going forward to try and not constantly tear him down. Sure enough, she ends up Taking the Bullet during Capture the Flag and gives him an Interrupted Declarationof Love. Though he does later get the message and they end up together.
-   _Ed, Edd n Eddy_:
    -   The Kanker Sisters are utterly head over heels for the Eds, as well as their worst tormentors. Somewhat unique in that their amorous feelings are completely known to their victims, and the bullying usually involves the girls forcing themselves on the Eds.
    -   Sarah falls in love with Edd in a season 1 episode and apparently gets over it. However, it's sometimes implied she still has a crush on him in later episodes and confirmed by her diary in "For Your Ed Only". This doesn't stop her from beating him up and treating him like crap. She writes in the diary that if she shows any mercy, people will be walking over her. So you could say she's sort of a Tsundere type A towards him.

        **Ed:** I think Sarah likes you, Eddy.

Her Dysfunctional Family caused her to fall for Arnold after he was the only person nice to her growing up and she got teased by her other classmates for it on the first day of preschool and lashed out in the way she often does in the present day. Out of fear of being bullied again and being rejected by him, she bullies him so no one ever finds out.

Double subverted when she then throws a raw steak through his bedroom window with a piece of paper attached with an apology and her phone number on it. His sisters were right after all! By the end of the episode, he and Ronnie Anne, the bully, are dating. However, that relationship quietly fizzled out somewhat.
-   _My Goldfish is Evil_: Desmona is this for Beanie, with her rudeness towards him being frequently punctuated by slips of the tongue making it clear she has a crush on him.

-   An episode of _Recess_ had a boy who was harassing Gretchen admit he was this trope after being confronted (the other half of the episode had him acting as a Dogged Nice Guy/Stalker with a Crush).
-   _Rugrats_:
    -   Chuckie once had a suitor like this. After trying to be nice to her and it failing, he becomes a Loving Bully for her as well. Then he sees her picking on another boy...
    -   Betty, Phil and Lil's mother, explains that she had picked on Howard when they were kids until much later when he realized she was this.
    -   In the spinoff _All Grown Up!_, Tommy is being picked on by a girl, with Kimi and Lil suggesting that she's doing it because she likes him. They're wrong, the girl really does hate Tommy because she had a role in one of his films, but Tommy cut her scene out (mainly for time).
-   _The Simpsons_: When Bart develops a crush on a girl, Nelson gives him advice that amounts to "bully her to win her love." Nelson gives Bart a piece of gum to stick in her hair, then adds an additional piece of gum. "Who knows, you may get lucky."
-   There was an episode of _Totally Spies!_ where a boy that used to pick on Clover when they were in grade school asked her out on a movie date because he liked her and wanted to make up for all the crap he put her through. She spends a good chunk of the episode trying to figure out how to get her revenge during the date, until coming to the conclusion that, maybe, he actually means it. Right after the movie starts, he pulls another prank on her, revealing that he never really changed. She dumps her drink on his head and storms out.
