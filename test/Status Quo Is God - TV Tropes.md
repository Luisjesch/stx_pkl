_"Looks like everything's back the way it was! Which is the only way it should ever be..."_

Within a work, particularly long-running series and franchises, almost _nothing_ changes. If something does change, it's generally reset back to the way it was before very quickly.

This usually happens in a series with no overarching conflict or plot, although it is also the final stage of Exponential Plot Delay, the phenomenon in which the plot of a serial story has totally ground to a halt. In either case, each installment of the series will open under virtually identical circumstances to the installment that came before.

Why create a static situation? The creators want the audience to be familiar with the characters and situation, without having to bother with such things as "what happened last episode".

This trope is especially true for cartoons, where networks want to be free to broadcast reruns in any convenient order or lack thereof. It's also very common in sitcoms and comics, and as a result, there is a lot of Aesop Amnesia created. Although characters have learned their lessons or attempted to improve their predicaments, nothing ever really changes.

While this trope can be used to help avoid Continuity Lockout, it also can be very difficult to juggle an unchanging status quo without gradually turning off your audience; characters and situations which never change tend to get stale after a while, and audiences can get a bit tired of seeing the Reset Button being pushed every time it looks like something might happen to change things.

Status Quo Is God can easily collide with Happily Ever After. Sometimes, a story simply can't have an ending that is both happy and maintains the status quo—thus, these two powerful tropes are in conflict with each other. When this conflict occurs, it's likely that the status quo will be maintained, and the ending will be less happy than it might have been if not for Status Quo Is God. For example, if a main character gains a significant other at the beginning of the episode, it is almost certain that they will break up by the end, for one reason or another. And if the entire series is specifically about the Unresolved Sexual Tension between two characters, or a Love Triangle of some sort, expect any potential romantic resolution to be squashed or reversed by the end of the episode so the leads can go back to pining for each other. (On the other hand, if the entire _series_ is due to end and the creators feel confident that they'll never do a sequel, they may decide to break this trope with a Grand Finale that permanently fixes everything; the Last-Minute Hookup being a frequent example.)

Status Quo Is God is usually the justification for a Yo Yo Plot Point or an Ageless Birthday Episode. It has nothing to do with the divinity of a certain rock band, however.

Negative Continuity is what happens when this trope is exaggerated—not only does nothing ever change, it doesn't even require an explanation In-Universe, the world just resets at the end of every episode. See also, Alternate Universe Reed Richards Is Awesome, in which characters get a glimpse of an alternative universe where things have, in fact, changed.

Related to Just Eat Gilligan and Un-Confession. Unlikely Spare may also be used to this effect. For the opposite, in which a work changes dramatically over the course of its run, see Nothing Is the Same Anymore.

## Not quite a sub-trope but often overlaps with it:

-   Bait the Dog: Sometimes, when a bad character showing its likeable side would modify the status quo, the writers would make that disappear, but not always.
-   Butt-Monkey: Sometimes, when a character's unchanging status quo makes them unlucky, however, this is not the only reason for a character to be unlucky.
-   Convenient Miscarriage: If the reason it's convenient is because the baby would change the status quo, but not an example if it's convenient to the _characters_.
-   Death is Cheap: When mortality can easily be reversed. This is not always because of this rule, however, and may be played for other reasons.
-   Disney Death: Fake deaths are used in place of real deaths. Not always a sub-trope because this is only one of many reasons for a fake death.
-   Fission Mailed: When losing a game sometimes modifies the status quo, it would subvert it into the game being continued, though it's not always the case.
-   A Fool and His New Money Are Soon Parted: A character suddenly comes into wealth and it is quickly lost, spent, or stolen, especially if the character is established as always hard-up for money.
-   Iron Butt Monkey: A Butt-Monkey is exposed to extreme physical abuse, yet it never dies or gets hurt at all. Very common in Slapstick comedies.
-   Jerk With A Heart Of Jerk: When the story suggests that a jerkass might have a nicer side but then doesn’t because of the status quo.
-   May It Never Happen Again: If the reason the effort is made not to repeat the story is because repeating the story would change the status quo. On the other hand, this is sometimes an **inversion** of Status Quo is God, since other times, people _try_ to change the status quo by ensuring the conflict doesn't repeat.
-   "Shaggy Dog" Story: A story's buildup has no payoff.
-   Shoo Out the New Guy: A new character joins the main cast but is then promptly written out. However, this is often due to the negative reception of the character.
-   They Killed Kenny Again: A comedic sub-trope of Death is Cheap and Negative Continuity. Sometimes done to maintain the status quo but other times it's played purely for Black Comedy.
-   Unsuccessful Pet Adoption: Someone adopts a pet, but it runs away or has to go. Maintaining the status quo is one of the reasons to play this trope, but not the only one.
-   Villains Act, Heroes React: If the hero were the one with a plan to change the world, a happy ending would involve the status quo changing. So instead, the villain is the one who wants to change the world, and the hero stops him to make sure nothing has to change.
-   Yank the Dog's Chain: Sometimes, the reason for an unlucky character's luck disappearing is because having it stick around would shake up the status quo, but not always.
