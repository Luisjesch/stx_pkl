**Rick Blaine:** I don't buy or sell human beings.  
**Senor Ferrari:** Too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. With refugees alone we can make a fortune if you work with me through the black market.

Criminals whose primary trade is the illegal transportation of live human beings; ranging from the smuggling of undocumented migrants (or ethnic menial laborers) across national borders, to selling people into forced labor and servitude (especially involuntary prostitution).

They tend to be sprawling, international organizations (or even imperialist aristocrats) with seemingly infinite resources. Their resources are not used for their victims, who are typically kept in filthy cages until sold to the highest bidder, who is typically an immensely wealthy businessman or even The Empire.

Real-world sex-traffickers don't snatch "nice" upper-middle-class women and children off the street, which is too difficult and risky. Rather, they usually target homeless, undocumented, poor people whose disappearances will attract much less attention, using seduction and/or blackmail to initially trick them into bad situations. Very often, women who fall prey to this were entirely aware that they were being recruited for sex work, but expected to be treated with a modicum of decency. In even more cynical works, the victims of this will end up being consumed by a High-Class Cannibal. In Period Pieces set in colonial eras, Hollywood Natives are often the targets of human trafficking.

Very common trade of Ruthless Foreign Gangsters, The Mafiya and other Eastern European gangsters have a particular association with the trade. To a lesser extent, The Cartel and Evil Colonialists from Hegemonic Empires will also dabble in this illicit business. They are also a popular tactic of Greenwashed Villainy, especially of non-sexual kind. Due to Rape Is a Special Kind of Evil and Slavery Is a Special Kind of Evil, human traffickers of the pimp variety (as well as other varieties to an extent) are near-universally considered to be over the Moral Event Horizon. See Superhuman Trafficking for a more fantastic variant. Contrast Underground Railroad, which is when people, persecuted or otherwise, are smuggled to safety, rather than being smuggled as cargo.

If the traffickers are in league with an Evil Colonialist, they're always prone to be Chased by Angry Natives.

Unfortunately Truth in Television (although to what degree is disputed, especially in regards to prostitution; for instance, controversial migrations scholar Laura Agustín disputes that so much prostitution is sex trafficking, while other scholars say that prostitution _is_ sex trafficking). Also, despite this page's and most fiction's concentration on the sexual kind, a lot of real-world human trafficking is for non-sexual domestic service, agricultural labour, sweatshops, or to provide the Generic Ethnic Crime Gang and/or Evil Colonialist's expendable menials.

Compare Evil Poacher, which deals with non-human animals.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Punisher MAX_:
    -   The Punisher goes after a trafficking ring in "The Slavers".

    -   "The Naked Kill" is another Punisher arc where the villains own a maximum-security apartment and use it to make Snuff Films (the Big Bad's nephew has a Gag Penis with which he rips the women apart), importing women from all over the world to keep up their numbers. Frank disguises himself as a janitor and makes his way through the floors in a master-class demonstration on using an Improvised Weapon, but the murder of the star is left to the victims after Frank kneecaps him.
-   In _Red Hood: The Lost Days_ Jason Todd discovers that his German mentor Egon is trafficking children.

-   _Wonder Woman_:

Said enemy turns out to be Jason Burke, the half-brother and nemesis of William Burke due to a past love triangle gone wrong, who decides to abduct William's only child, Leslie, and then fake her death and intends to have Leslie sold off to a human trafficking syndicate in a misguided attempt to spite his brother. Needless to say, of the many new characters introduced in the story, Jason Burke is the most despised of all, by the story's characters and readers alike.

This is one of the reasons why Mr. White, a former member, defected and went into hiding, since he was appalled by the levels of evil that Oberhauser sank to. Mr. White's actions here are interesting considering that he made his introduction in _Casino Royale (2006)_ brokering a deal between Le Chiffre and Obanno, the latter of whom uses Child Soldiers. In that scene, Mr. White does seem mildly uneasy as he watches one of the children serving Obanno, foreshadowing his later defection.
-   The _Taken_ series is about an American man who gets into a lengthy feud with a gang of Albanian sex traffickers, initially after they kidnap his daughter while she's on holiday in Paris.

    Literature 

-   In _The Chosen (1997)_, the villains are a group of vampires and werewolves who are kidnapping human girls to sell them into slavery to Night People. This is illegal under Night World law because it potentially attracts too much attention, though it still happens occasionally.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Big Sky_: Ronald and Legarski sell the woman he kidnaps as sex slaves.
-   _Bones_ deals with this in the episode "Lost Love in the Foreign Land". It starts as a typical murder case but escalates when someone who's questioned reveals that she was trafficked.

-   _Charlie's Angels_: Several episodes, including a large part of the cringeworthy criminal enterprise the Angels take down in Season 5's "Angel in Hiding" (a "modeling agency" used as a front to sell "failed" models — i.e., those who refuse to give into sexual harassment — into, among other things, human trafficking and prostitution).
-   _Cold Case_: The episode "Cargo" is about a human trafficking organisation that is running Eastern European girls as sex slaves and using Philadelphia's docks' cargo containers as a means of transport.

    -   Season ten's arc expanded on the same concept, following a ring who used the dark web to sell victims to serial killers.

-   _CSI-verse_:
    -   The "CSI Trilogy" revolved around an organized nation-wide ring of human traffickers. The story began in Miami when Langston was invited to come take a look at some evidence that linked to a case of his from Vegas, then moved on to NYC, before concluding back in Sin City.
    -   Earlier _CSI: NY_'s "She's Not There" involved a Russian man who was killed while searching for his missing daughter who, as it turns out, had been lured into a sex-trafficking ring after being promised a modeling career in the US.
-   _Daredevil (2015)_:
    -   The Russian syndicate that Wilson Fisk has an alliance with are trafficking in girls at the docks. Matt is introduced attacking them as a container of girls are being unloaded at the docks, then tells the terrified captives to run to the cops.
    -   The Yakuza, actually a front for the Hand, are also doing this, with one subplot in season 1 being that Nobu and his people need Fisk to secure the docks as they bring in a Black Sky (which turns out to be a young boy).
-   _Dexter_: One of Dexter's victims was a businessman who was smuggling illegal immigrants into the United States in containers and murdering those who couldn't pay him. What was more surprising to Dexter is that the man's wife, whom he initially believed to be in the dark about her husband's crimes, was a co-conspirator in their trafficking ring.
-   _Doctor Who_. In "Warrior's Gate", the Villain of the Week is a crew of humans trafficking in a race of aliens called Tharils. For Dramatic Irony, the Tharils themselves once kept slaves, including humans.

-   _Rizzoli & Isles_: In the season three episode "Cuts Like A Knife", The killer in the episode, named "Cutthroat", traffics young women in from Croatia and auctions the virgin girls to the highest bidder.
-   In _Star Trek_, this is one of the crimes of the Orion Syndicate, as demonstrated in _Star Trek: Enterprise_ when they kidnap nine Starfleeters to sell them into slavery (fortunately, all nine are rescued). The Orion even sell their own women into sexual slavery; though this is mitigated (for a _very_ loose definition of the term) by the fact that the women seem to enjoy being enslaved — and because of their pheromones, it's actually their masters who are held in thrall.
-   _Trapped (2015)_: In one subplot of the first season of this Nordic Noir series, the Captain and the purported Chief Engineer (actually just a gangster) of a ferry between Scandinavia and Iceland are involved in a conspiracy to smuggle African women into Iceland for prostitution.
-   _True Blood_:
    -   One of the things that's mentioned about vampire monarchs in the show is that they regularly have humans procured for them, and that they hire other vampires to do this on their behalf. Procuring by definition is when you obtain someone as a prostitute for a client. And considering that vampires have a history of taking humans against their will (either through glamouring or kidnapping), and that when vampires feed on humans, sex usually goes with it regardless of whether or not the human can consent. This leads to some icky implications.
    -   In season 3, it's revealed that Bill has been a procurer for Queen Sophie Anne for 35 years and was tasked with sampling humans before bringing them to her. Russell Edgington later hires him to procure a woman from a strip club, and the results are not pretty.

While Vera shuts the operation done, it turns out only to tangentially connected to why the man was murdered.
-   _The Wire_: The Greeks, an international crime syndicate which first appears in season 2, engages in sex trafficking among several other illegal activities such as the drug trade. They first come to the attention of the BPD when a group of Eastern European girls are left to suffocate in a crate in the Baltimore docks.

    Myths & Religion 

-   _The Bible_: The city of Babylon in the Book of Revelation is judged because among her merchandise that the nations buy of is "the bodies and souls of men", implying that human trafficking is permitted by her. However, the Old Testament has Hebrews themselves permitted to buy Hebrew and foreign slaves (though there are limits on the former). Slavery was ubiquitous in the Middle East at the time of course.

    Podcasts 

-   Podcast _His Night Begins_ has protagonist Virat Nariman go up against an Indian child-trafficking operation as the plot of its first two seasons.

-   _Call of Juarez: The Cartel_: One mission has your characters rescuing a group of American women being trafficked into Mexico.

Nora's DLC chapter elaborates that not only do they force victims into prostitution, but they use babies for human experimentation. It's later revealed that PAFF/Aroma White, one of the main characters, is actually a girl named Kaori who was kidnapped by traffickers and transformed into a Clone by Conversion of Aroma via Magic Plastic Surgery and brainwashing.
-   _Deus Ex: Mankind Divided_ has the Dvali crime family, which deal in smuggling. One sidequest has Adam encounter a woman who seeks to use them to escape from Prague to avoid being sent to an aug ghetto.
-   _Fallout: New Vegas_ has a particularly disturbing sidequest where the Courier is tasked with investigating some missing persons from a refugee camp just outside of Vegas. Their search leads them to a pair of slavers who have been snatching people from nearby settlements to sell to the Fiends for torture and other unsavory activities. They even keep a log detailing their recent transactions, including the fact that they even raped the slaves themselves until they realized it lowered their value. Popping these psychos is easily one of the most satisfying moments in the entire game.
-   The antagonists of _Far Cry 3_ are involved in this, among other things. The Establishing Character Moment of the Big Bad is him welcoming some recently-hired mercenaries into his organisation, where he details the rules about keeping "the product" in good condition: "You can fuck 'em, boys, but be gentle".
-   Unsurprisingly for _Grand Theft Auto_ games, given their nature of their criminal underworlds it should be expected to involve this:
    -   _Advance_: One of the Yakuza missions involves the player kidnapping Mafia goons and bringing them to the docks, where they are sailed off to Asia as slave servants.

The brutal fashion of her rescue turned her into a Sadist, and she joined her saviors to became a terrifying Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds.
-   _Mafia III_: The Southern Union deals in kidnapping black people off the streets and selling them to rich people through auction. Which Lincoln does not take kindly to at all. After he rescues the slaves, kills the slavers and takes over this operation, he makes it VERY clear to his underbosses that they will need to find another way to earn money than dealing in the slave trade.
-   In _Marco & the Galaxy Dragon_, large numbers of people were kidnapped by aliens ten years before the start of the game. Some of the victims, like Marco, were sold into slavery, while others were dismembered and sold as Human Resources. Astaroth was behind the kidnappings.
-   Alluded to in _Persona 5_, when the team confronts Junya Kaneshiro's Shadow after he tries to blackmail them for 3 million yen:
