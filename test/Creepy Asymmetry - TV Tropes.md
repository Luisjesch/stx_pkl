People tend to gravitate towards finding this creepy.

_"By making a character asymmetrical, they look like they've been sort of put together wrong \[...\] injecting asymmetry into a character design is a good way to make something look unbalanced or unnatural."_

Most creatures we see, including humans, are symmetrical in nature. We can identify what we see as relatable because of that subconscious association we fall back on; the distribution of limbs, the composition of a face, the evenness of a smile. When something goes against the expectation of symmetry, we immediately notice it, and it can creep us the hell out.

Characters with unnatural asymmetry aren't necessarily bad or dangerous, but that off-putting element persists. They can be human, animal, monster, and so on; the asymmetry in their appearance is what makes the trope. Body Horror is often at play.

-   Disfigurements or defects (which _can_ point to Unfortunate Implications)
-   Extra limbs on one side
-   Unevenly sized limbs (can include The Right Hand of Doom)
-   Uneven torsos
-   Facial features that don't belong where they are (can include Eyes Do Not Belong There and Two-Faced)

This might not even apply to a character's physical features either. How they present themself through things like movement can invoke this effect too, like an uneven walk or a stance that doesn't look quite right. It's why zombies always look creepy in motion.

Blob Monster can be considered a Sub-Trope, as creatures that fall under the trope are naturally asymmetrical (any examples of this pertaining to such creatures should be directed there).

Can overlap with Red Right Hand if the character is also evil. Contrast with Fashionable Asymmetry in which a character deliberately dons asymmetrical elements for the sake of style.
