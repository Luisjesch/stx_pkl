_"Okay, new rule: If the Ghost Wizard's eyes start to shimmer... DON'T LOOK INTO THEM. YOU ARE SO DENSE SOMETIMES."_

If the eyes are the windows to the soul, this person has a very... persuasive... compelling... even possessive soul. With little more than a few words intoned in their deep, Compelling Voice, any fool gazing into their eyes will be hopelessly hypnotized.

The mind control victim who has gazed too long into this abyss will likely develop Mind-Control Eyes. High power Hypnotic Eyes (or when broadcast) may function like a Hypno Ray and work on _several_ onlookers at once.

If the hypnotist is using glasses, then it's likely a Mind-Control Device instead of this trope.

-   One commercial for _Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins_, the debut of Wario as a villain, has him trying to use Hypnotic Eyes to brainwash people into obeying him.
    
    **Wario:** Obey Wario, destroy Mario!
    
-   This Japanese commercial features a young caterpillar with hypnotic eyes.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Code Geass_:
    -   Lelouch has something akin to this; his "Geass" (a power closely connected to eyes and sight) allows him to issue "absolute orders". If Lelouch geasses you to do something, you do it — no questions asked. Not fully this trope (there are enough differences to distance it), but certainly closely related. Especially when it becomes _permanently_ active.
    -   Rolo's Geass from _R2_ is more hypnotic in nature than Lelouch's (it freezes everyone's perception of time) and is centered on his eye, but it doesn't require eye contact to take effect (it works within a radius).
-   Saralegui from _Kyo Kara Maoh!_.
-   Alucard from _Hellsing_ has these, as befitting a powerful true vampire. Of particular note is the scene where he takes control of one of the SWAT team at the hotel in Brazil, making him open the elevator doors keeping him from slaughtering them all.
-   Kurumu from _Rosario + Vampire_ seduces the main character with these (Justified Trope: she's a succubus), though she calls the ability "Charm." She only really uses it in one episode, though, after her Heel–Face Turn.
    -   She has also used it once in the manga after her introduction. But here there is a explanation for this as she wants to catch Tsukunes heart with fair play and not with her powers, not only for her love for him but also her love for the rest of the girls in the harem. This turns into a tear jerker when she accidentally charms Tsukune and spends the rest of the day with him in her room, ending with her trying to make him saying that he likes her until it's instead her who breaks down to tears and says that she likes him
-   Sakura in _Kämpfer_.
-   Naoi plays these almost entirely for gags in _Angel Beats!_.
-   In _Naruto_, members of the Uchiha clan can manifest Sharingan eyes, which have hypnotic powers ranging from subtly throwing off the target's perception of reality to outright mind control. A common piece of advice when fighting Uchiha is to read their actions by watching their feet and hands, as even casual eye contact can be fatal. As first shown with Kakashi, the Sharingan's tomoes usually spin wildly around the pupil when this power is active.
-   Hiei from _YuYu Hakusho_. His Third Eye gives him a number of psychic abilities. Although sadly, they are rarely, to never used.
-   When Princess Buburina uses these in _Catnapped!_, her eyes change colors AND physically rotate around themselves rapidly. Whether it's hypnosis or it simply causes the victim to have a seizure is debatable.
-   In the hentai _Alien from the Darkness_, when the eponymous alien is in its human female form and begins seducing a crew-member, its eyes flash green before revealing its unexpected appendages. Once this happens, the alien's victims' eyes go blank, and they seemingly become unable (or unwilling) to resist.
-   _Trigun_: Dominique the Cyclops. When she opens her eye shutter, her Demon's Eye can dazzle _all five_ of a victim's senses, making it seem like she teleports from place to place. Once he figured out what she was doing, Vash defeats the hypnosis by using intense pain to keep his senses awake.
-   In _Maid-Sama!_, Soutaro Kanou has this. He attempted to hypnotize Usui by making him look into his eyes, but it didn't work. It's implied that he used the same technique on Yukimura and Misaki the second time.
-   In _Scrapped Princess_, anyone who gazes into the eyes of a Peacemaker immediately falls under their control (called Providence). Their influence is so strong that entire cities can be made to submit to their will. One of the reasons they're after Pacifica is she's immune to Providence _and_ can pass this onto others (she twice invokes involuntary magical outbursts—anyone caught within gains her immunity).
-   Noroi, a white weasel in _Ganba No Bouken_. When his red eyes shine eerily, he can apply hypnotism. And he'd do a violent, cruel and villainous acts.

    Comic Books 

-   Blade is resistant to vampire mesmerism, but cannot do it himself. However he was given said ability in the Ultimate universe.
-   The fakir in the _Tintin_ story _Cigars of the Pharaoh_; even Tintin is unable to resist the power of his eyes and weird gestures. More so in the Animated Adaptation where his eyes are enough to hypnotize someone, and his pupils light up.
-   Along with all the combined powers of the _Fantastic Four_, the Super Skrull has mesmerizing eyes.
-   Non-_Paperinik New Adventures_ Paperinik villains Spectrus and Sapphire have this ability. Sapphire can also shoot lightnings, but Spectrus can't... And compensates with a power so big he can hypnotize his victims through _video tapes_ (that's how Paperinik got him the first time: he taped him and then tricked him into watching the tape. He later started doing this to others to steal). They become partners in crime (and get a lot of Ship Tease) when they finally meet in _Ultraheroes_.
-   _Diabolik_:
    -   The title character has them, but isn't too good with it and people can realize what he'd doing and break eye contact. Hence why he once used a shining monocle as a help.
    -   In the story "I Am Diabolik", Diabolik was at the receiving end of this, having been captured by Clerville's queen of the mob Natasha Morgan and resisted the Truth Serum only to find out her underling Victor was an hypnotist and spill out some of his secrets before recovering and beating the crap out of him. As Diabolik and Natasha later teamed up, it's likely he learned the trick from Victor.
-   In _Violine_, the main character's (and presumably, her father's) eyes sometimes have this effect on people. In the climax, Marushka is revealed to have these, along with actual hypnotic powers.
-   _Iznogoud_: "Mesmer-Eyezed" sees Iznogoud contracting a stage hypnotist who can make anyone think they are anything (usually an animal) by looking into his eyes. However, clapping breaks the spell, so when the vizier tries to get the hypnotist to make the Caliph think he is a donkey, suddenly they are unable to get away from people making clapping noises. Frustrated that Iznogoud refuses to pay him, the hypnotist makes him think he is a rattlesnake - a deaf rattlesnake who cannot hear the clapping that would break the spell...
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: Villain Hypnota's "Blue Hypnotic Ray" can be projected from her eyes and hands.

-   _X-Men_:
    -   Gambit's most notable traits from his mutation are his red irises on black sclerae. One of his lesser known mutant powers is a hypnotic charm from eye contact that makes people more compliant to him. It's less effective if the target knows about it.
    -   X-Men villain Sauron is a were-pterodactyl that's also an energy vampire, complete with hypnotic eye contact.
-   In _Superman_ storyline _The Untold Story of Argo City_, an alien named Zygor develops the power to project hypnotic beams from his single, enormous eye.

Eventually Iris becomes so confused he ends up hypnotizing himself.

Except there's actually no such thing as hypnosis - what actually paralyzes rabbits is their own fear of the serpents.
-   Molly Moon has a hypnotic gaze as her main (and original) power.
-   Olga Barcova (also known as "The Green Terror"), one of the two arch-nemesises of Norwegian police inspector Knut Gribb, can use her brilliant green eyes to hypnotize any man.

-   _Artemis Fowl_: All fairies can use a hypnotic power called mesmer by prolonged eye contact, which makes the victim happy, docile and compliant to the fairy's orders. Artemis figures out that it can be countered by wearing mirrored contact lenses, but pretends to be mesmerized in order to avoid the fairies finding his contingency plan against the Fake Memories they're going to implant.
-   N'Ktane and her "son" Stalker have these in _Tasakeru_.

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_.
    -   "Buffy vs. Dracula". The Count has hypnotic Occult Blue Eyes that can enthrall even Buffy.
    -   Drusilla uses them on Kendra to distract her long enough to slit her throat with her FREAKIN' FINGERNAIL!. The next episode she uses them to hypnotize Giles into believing she's Jenny Calendar

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Master has a long history of hypnotizing people by staring into their eyes and telling them to obey him.

Given its Gonzo, he's okay, and actually proud of his accomplishment.
-   All vampires in the series _True Blood_ possess this power (assuming their maker taught it to them). It seems to get more powerful with age, like most vampire abilities in the _True Blood_ universe: while most vampires can put you in a trance while looking into their eyes and affect your perception, older vampires (or possibly just Russell Edgington) seem to be able to be able to look into your eyes once and then subsequently leave you in a trance even after eye contact is broken.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: In "Black Leather Jackets", Steve uses his eyes to hypnotize Stuart Tillman into thinking that he, Scott and Fred are nice young men, though the effect is short-lived.
-   A constant on _The Vampire Diaries_ and its spin-offs _The Originals_ and _Legacies_ in how the vampires use "compulsion" on people. A regular bit in all the shows is a close-up of the vampire's eyes and then a close-up of the victim's as they accept whatever they're told (unless they've been taking vervain, which counteracts compulsion). Also, vampires who've been feeding only on animals aren't able to do it.
-   All vampires in _Young Dracula_ but Vlad takes the cake. He's so good that he mind-wiped an entire crowd, including several slayers and Renfield, into forgetting about vampires. It was so strong that Renfield's memory was still being re-wiped every time he re-learned about vampires four years later.

    Video Games 

-   The Tiki Tak tribe from _Donkey Kong Country Returns_ aren't much of body, so they invoke this trope into hypnotizing various animals into doing their labor for them. Beings of higher thought capacity are proofed against this power, but since this is an animals-only universe, that limits it to the Kongs. The first level literally starts with Donkey Kong demonstrating this fact to one of them the only way he knows how.
-   _Dragon Quest_: Lullab-Eye, which first appears from _Dragon Quest VI_ onwards, sends one enemy to sleep with a gaze from the user's eyes, be it Aamon,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Murdaw, his master Mortamor, Orgodemir, Dhoulmagus<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Rhapthorne, Corvus<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and other villains such as Maldragora, or normal enemy monsters from _Dragon Quest VII_ onwards, starting with Eyesaurs and Testudogres. It's usually non-resistant and the sleep status cannot be cured until the victim awakens either after some turns have passed or is attacked during the battle, though from _Dragon Quest IX_ onwards, it can be resisted when the would've been victim is in Super High Tension, and by _Dragon Quest X_ onwards, it can also be cured with sleep healing items and spells.

-   Several characters in _Sibylline Sounds_ have this ability, most of them are snakes.

    Webcomics 

-   Black Mage of _8-Bit Theater_ has on two occasions used Hypnovision on his allies. Both occasions did little to no good, as the first target (Fighter) was too dumb to be affected by it (even though he actually kinda was), and the second (Red Mage) was wearing mirrored shades for "no apparent reason".
-   In _Captus Cinematic Universe_, Tizer gets the attention of his victims so they can look into his eye and fall under his spell.
-   Count Antonie the vampire tries this on Meryl in _Minion_. She of course sees right through it and clobbers him.

It's explained that Lil' Cal is a Soul Jar for English, so staring into its eyes is effectively the same as staring into English's soul. And you wonder why the Striders wear Sunglasses at Night!
-   In _Lucid Spring_, Pacem and Viktor deal with a bear that sends them into an intense hallucination through eye contact.
-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_: Spirits corrupted by the Rash are able to lure those who can see and hear them into a trap via a Compelling Voice that requires intial eye contact with the target to work.

At the time the story begins, she's hypnotized all Red characters except three, and she is actively trying to complete her "collection". Her almost-sultry attitude when trying to bait people into eye contact adds shades of Femme Fatale to this.
    
    **Ignacia:** Hello, stranger. Tell me, do you think that I have pretty eyes?
    
-   _Vampire Girl_: Paul uses this on Levana as a way to apprehend her after he and Saul sneak into the hospital costume ball to do just that; it's particularly effective because he does this through a bathroom mirror, in which he casts no reflection.

    -   The Gigglepies from "So Totally Spaced Out" use these on Cosmo and Wanda. It stops working when their rhyming habit begins to falter.
    -   The eponymous "Fair Bears" use these on Timmy, Cosmo, Wanda and Chloe to lull them into a nap so they can mind control the first and third mentioned.
-   _Futurama_ has the Hypnotoad, whose penetrating gaze lulls you into a mindless catatonic state until all you care about is praising the creature's glory.
-   _The Godzilla Power Hour_ features a bipedal cobra-monster named "_Axor_", one of his superpowers is to hypnotize its victims by firing a grey laser from his eyes at the victim's eyes as well. He uses this on the Calico Crew (minus Godzooky) and multiple humans to serve him, having already forced them to build him his own castle. Strangely enough, not only does his hypnosis not work on those who are sick, but it also winds up being his own undoing.
-   _Growing Up Creepie_: The wasp in "Attack of the Wasp Zombies" has these, which are used to entrance his victims before stinging them, turning them into his mindless slaves.
-   Count Dracula can do this in the Hotel Transylvania franchise. First seen at the end of the first movie where he compels a skeptic to hit himself in the head with a mug to prove he's really Dracula. Mavis has the _potential_ to do this, but it doesn't yet work on anyone except Donald.
-   _I ♡ Arlo_: The Bog Lady from the Season 1 finale has these, which she uses on Arlo during her Villain Song when he's ensnared in her vine trap so he doesn't leave the swamp.
-   Tak in _Invader Zim_ seems to possess these in the form of some sort of device in or near her eyes. While in disguise, a flash of her eyes allows her to erase short-term memories of her victims (unless their mind is too strong, like Dib's and Gaz's were) and, in one case, impose her will over others.
    
    **Girl:** Looks like Zim has a girlfriend!
    
    **Tak:** It's not NICE...to embarrass people! You should apologize...and...\[eyes flash\] eat your eraser!
    
    **Girl:** (With Mind-Control Eyes) Yes, Tak! I'm sorry, Zim. \[Takes a bite out of her eraser\]
    
-   _Jellystone!_: This version of Spooky can apparently hypnotize people, and when she does, her eyes fill with static. She used this in one episode to get someone to buy expired fish sticks.
-   Sunil from _Littlest Pet Shop (2012)_ has these. He uses them on the Biskit Twins in the episode "Gailbreak!".
-   In the Looney Tunes short "Mexican Boarders", Slowpoke Rodriguez, the Slowest Mouse in all Mexico, uses Hypnotic Eyes to zap Sylvester into becoming his obedient slave, thus showing how he's been able to survive.
    
    **Slowpoke:** Slowpoke may be pretty slow downstairs in the feets but is pretty fast upstairs in the _cabeza_.
    
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_
    -   Fluttershy's "the stare" is compelling enough to put a cockatrice, a brood of chickens, or an entire _colony_ of vampire fruit bats into a suggestible trance.
    -   Discord, in his initial appearance as a major villain, showcases this ability, which he uses to invert the personalities of most of the main characters (except Twilight). He uses this as the finishing touch after having worn down his victims the "fun" way first, but when Fluttershy proves immune to this kind of persuasion, he skips straight to the magic out of exasperation.
    -   In Bridle Gossip Pinkie Pie _claims_ that Zecora the Zebra has this ability, and shows the swirling eyes herself when she sings a song about it, but she is just imagining things/making things up.
-   The Hypnobrai Tribe from _Ninjago_ lure their victims into being hypnotised by rattling their tails and staring their victims straight in the eye. They can also plant post-hypnotic commands in which the victim acts as a sleeper agent, seeing through their eyes and enforcing their control. Cole unfortunately had to find this out the hard way.
-   _Rupert_: The eponymous Great Mephisto has this ability.
-   _Skysurfer Strike Force_ villain, Dr. Five Eyes has this power, but oddly for just the eye in the center of his forehead.
-   In the original _ThunderCats_ episode ''The Doom Gaze'', this is the power the evil Ta-She possesses. Tiny problem. It only works on men.
-   In _The Twelve Tasks of Asterix_, Iris the Great Egyptian Magician has spotlight-like eyes he uses to hypnotize people.
    
    **Iris:** "By Osiris and by Apis, look in my eyes. You have turned into a wild boar. Yes! A wiiillld boooaaarrr..."
    
-   _Winx Club_: This is one of Darcy's powers.

    Real Life 

-   In hypnosis, particularly in stage hypnosis and instant inductions, eye contact is essential. If you stare at someone without blinking long enough, many people naturally fall into a light trance attempting to keep eye contact with you. In stage hypnosis, the term is literally called the "hypnotic gaze".
-   Cillian Murphy.
-   Apparently, Wolf Messing as well.
-   According to last Russian Empress Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse), also Rasputin.
-   Another Russian, Natalia Guseva.
-   An interesting natural world variant — cuttlefish can use special pigment cells called chromatophores to cycle their entire bodies through multiple colors, hypnotizing their prey in a manner very similar to this trope.
    -   According to some scientists, cephalopods actually see color with their skin, essentially making the entire cuttlefish a giant Hypnotic Eye.
-   Since olden times, folklore across many cultures has attributed snakes with many preternatural abilities, with a hypnotic gaze being a common one. This particular myth often points to the snake's unblinking stare as it approaches its prey, the prey itself remaining frozen in place despite the impending threat, and how the snake occasionally moves its head from side to side or back and forth in what seems like the manner of a hypnotist. That is not the only explanation for these phenomena, however. While the snake may have a hypnotic gaze in folklore, they probably don't elsewhere. In truth, moving their heads side to side may help with depth perception, while prey remaining motionless may be a defensive mechanism to avoid being seen.
