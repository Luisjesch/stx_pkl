_"I may be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it."_

Normally, you'd expect a character known for being tough and cynical about people to also be wary of romantic love. They of all people know that Love Is a Weakness. It's dangerous sentimentality that clouds your judgement and makes you vulnerable to being manipulated or having your heart broken. But for every Confirmed Bachelor or Celibate Hero who scoffs at love, there's another otherwise hard-boiled character who can't help falling in love against their better judgement.

This type is vulnerable to The Dulcinea Effect and Because You Were Nice to Me, dropping their responsibilities and self-interest so they can stick their neck out for some person they just fell in love with. In all other respects, they're a level-headed professional, or a Wild Card who doesn't trust anyone but themselves, which makes people who know them wonder why they only lose their head when there's romance involved. Maybe they're a Chivalrous Pervert who can't say "no" to a pretty guy or lady who asks for help. Maybe on the inside, they just want to be loved, or they're a Knight in Sour Armor who wants to find just one person in their rotten world who they can believe in. Maybe being a champion for someone is what gives their life a sense of meaning. Regardless of their reasons, if you ask them why they always fall for it even though they've been burned before, they'll straight up tell you, "I'm a sucker for romance," or, "I'm just a fool for love." In a way, they have the same attitude towards romance that the Knight in Sour Armor has toward heroism.

It's more common to see the male version, because of the stereotype that Men Are Tough, but a Broken Bird female can be a Fool for Love as well. If the Fool for Love is a guy, he'll often have a secret artsy or feminine side. He may seem like a gun (or sword or fist) slinging showboat, but when no one is looking he is reading and writing poetry. Or painting landscapes. Or just looking forlornly at the horizon, but real artfully. Conversely, a female fool for love may act "unladylike" most of the time, but turn out to be a Tomboy with a Girly Streak.

This has been a _very_ common trope in popular music and was particularly in vogue in The '50s. The idea is that for better or for worse, you have to be a fool to fall in love, but songs can portray it either idealistically or cynically.

This trope overlaps with Love Makes You Dumb, but it's fundamentally more of an idealism trope than an intelligence trope. The fool for love often knows from experience what they're getting into, and willfully ignores red flags instead of being too blinded by naivete or hubris to see them in the first place. In fact, the character's feelings don't even have to necessarily lead to real stupidity as long as they believe in their own head that their feelings are foolish. Compare Love Martyr, which is a character who stays loyal to a romantic partner who mistreats them. Such a character may be a Serial Spouse or a Serial Romeo.

Careful not to confuse the trope with the 1985 film _Fool for Love_.

## Examples:

    Anime & Manga 

-   Sanji from _One Piece_ is a self-confessed Slave to Love. Any moderately attractive woman can manipulate his chivalry, and any woman _period_ is subject to his protection. Even if they're enemies.
-   Harima Kenji from _School Rumble_ fits the badass-in-love description to a T in his feelings toward Tsukamoto Tenma.
-   A (maybe) platonic version of this is Kamina from _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ initially appears to be a big, boastful, fearless meathead, but his bluster is both a cover for his inner doubts and a way to inspire courage in others, _especially_ his Blood Brother Simon. He admits to Yoko in episode 8 that he'd have given in to despair long ago if it were not for his absolute faith in Simon, and shortly thereafter goes on his first mission where he and Simon fight separately...and only Simon comes back alive.
-   The typically caustic Chazz/Jun from _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_ always goes crazy in the presence of Alexis/Asuka and always tries to impress her, but always fails.
-   _Berserk_:
    -   A villainous yet quite tragic example in the Count. He was once a Knight Templar who fought pagans, but he maintained a family life with his wife and daughter. He loved his wife dearly, but when he found out about her unfaithfulness, his world comes crashing down and he ended up sacrificing her to the God Hand to become an emotionless demon in his moment of despair.
    -   Guts himself also qualifies for this trope. He's the most macho, most badass character in the story, but _damn_ if he doesn't love Casca, traveling across treacherous terrain and battling unspeakable enemies all for her wellbeing. Even before things took a turn for the worse in their relationship, Casca was one of those few individuals whom Guts showed his softer, emotional, and even vulnerable side to. His situation is very much the dark and tragic example of this trope, because Casca goes insane and amnesiac after her traumatic experience during the Eclipse and ceases to remember Guts. Guts is not very happy for a long while.
-   In _Finder Series_, Asami Ryuichi is usually a cautious and very intelligent man. But when his lover Akihito gets kidnapped by an old enemy, he makes several highly rash and questionable choices to get him back — from embarking in a rescue mission with two still unhealed gunshot wounds to cutting deals with other criminal organizations to force his old enemy into a corner.
-   Gets referenced in _Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz_: when Heero immediately goes to rescue the kidnapped Relena, Duo quietly remarks "Anything and everything for the one you love..." (in the English dub) or "Heh, somebody's got a crush" (in the original Japanese).
-   Ironically, Sousuke of all people in _Full Metal Panic!_ grows into unrepentant Fool for Love when he finally recognizes his feelings for Kaname.
    
    **Sousuke:** Because of her.
    
    **Sousuke:** Why couldn't it be?
    

    Comic Books 

-   Wolverine sure seems like an uncaring loner until you look at the gaggle of one true loves he has loved and lost throughout the years.

    Fan Works 

-   _The Bolt Chronicles_: The pre-canon stories in this series normally present Mittens as being wary of settling into an established relationship given how often she has been burned by male cats in the past. In "The Clouds," however, she falls for Tom — and much against her better judgement. Not surprisingly, things do not end well for her.
    
    **Mittens**: C’mon, Mittens — get a hold of yourself. Quit swooning already. You know better than this. He’s just another run-of-the-mill Olympian Greek god. A sawbuck a dozen.
    
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ fanfic _Gankona, Unnachgiebig, Unità_: Germany and Japan, who were both hardened and distrusting, couldn't help but fall in love with Italy. Not that they cared.

    Films — Animated 

-   In _Hercules_, Megara ended up enslaved to Hades because she sacrificed herself for a boyfriend who didn't remain true to her. As a result, she lost her faith in men, but when she finds herself falling in love with Hercules—whom she's supposed to be manipulating on orders from Hades—she sings a song called "Won't say I'm in love" in which her head is telling her to get a grip, but the Muses are telling her to listen to her heart.

    Films — Live Action 

-   In _Inception_, professional extractor Cobb keeps a projection of his deceased wife Mal locked up in a level of his subconscious because he was never able to let go of her, even though the last thing she did before she committed suicide was to frame him for killing her. Indeed, the reason he can't move on is that he blames himself for planting the idea in her head which made her convinced that the real world they had returned to was actually the dream (and vice-versa), and that the only way to return to reality was for them to kill themselves. When Cobb's projection of Mal gets out of control and starts trying to kill the members of the inception team during the operation on Fisher, his teammates reproach him for having hidden her existence from them when she posed such a danger to the mission, and for hesitating to Shoot the Dog when all their lives are at stake.

    Literature 

-   _Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation: Mo Dao Zu Shi_: Despite being an icy and cynical teenager that was resistant to the idea of getting close to anyone, Lan Wangji eventually became hopelessly in love with Wei Wuxian, to the point of fighting against his clan to protect him.
-   Riley Biers from _Eclipse_, who did everything in the name of his lover, Victoria. He was only a pawn to her.
-   Jamie Lannister in _A Song of Ice and Fire_. He may be the deadliest and most sarcastic knight in the Seven Kingdoms, but everything he's done he did for his special someone.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Spike, from _Buffy_ and later _Angel_. He may be the biggest Badass on the show (at least in the show's first few seasons) but he is always doing it for a very special lady, whether she be a psychotic vampire, a troubled slayer, a cute physicist or an elder goddess. He snarks and acts all tough but at the end of the day, all he wants is to watch out for his one true love.
-   Sawyer from _Lost_ definitely qualifies as one of these. He may be a rugged con man who insults anyone who will stand still long enough but his only two hobbies are reading and gazing forlornly at Kate.
    -   At least until Season 6, when he takes up listening to punk music and mourning Juliet.
-   Damon from _The Vampire Diaries_ is definitely one of these, in the same vein as another snarky vampire. He spends 146 years searching for Katherine and falls for her doppelganger, Elena to whom he is just as loyal to, if in his own crazy way.
-   Sherlock Holmes in _Elementary_ is implied to be this. Joan deduces in the pilot that a big part of his motives from his Dark and Troubled Past has to do with his own lost Lenore.
    -   Revealed to be true and then _painfully_ subverted when it is revealed his Lenore was never really lost and was playing him the whole time.
-   Thomas Barrow from _Downton Abbey_ is an incorrigible bastard most of the time, but whenever he falls for someone he goes to great lengths in pursuit of a (same-sex) relationship - a practice which is likely to get him thrown in prison if exposed, considering the time period.
-   Chandler from _Friends_ is typically a Stepford Snarker and commitment-phobic because of his difficult childhood. However, in his few early relationships, he's extremely devoted and romantic buying Janice a draw and spending days hunting down a childhood book for Kathy. When he gets together with Monica he comes up with romantic speeches that _any_ guy would be proud of, let alone a cynic who claims all relationships are doomed. Ironically out of the three guys (both of which are viewed as better with women than him) he's the first to get married and actually make a relationship work.
-   Simon from _The Inbetweeners_ will do anything for the girl he happens to be in love with at the time. Him being one of the main characters and thus one of the universe's playthings, this usually ends badly for him.
-   Neal Caffrey, so much so. This is the man that eluded the FBI for years. The only crime that they had enough evidence to convict him for was bond forgery when he also committed art theft, counterfeit, and assorted other crimes. This is also the man that only got caught because he prioritized finding Kate over logic, and the man that escaped from prison for her.
-   The eponymous _Galavant_ tried to defy this trope, saying that he came from a long line of passionate people, including his parents (who loved each other - sometimes violently) and wanted to avoid living the life that they did. However, he met Madelena, and fell hard for her.
-   _Bates Motel_: Sheriff Alex Romero is a dangerous, never-smiling policeman of _very_ questionable morals who will not hesitate to kill if he deems it necessary, and at first glance doesn't seem to have a romantic or even somewhat soft bone in his body. He is also helplessly in love with Norma Bates, for whom he becomes a gentler, kinder person; he shows her incredible tenderness and would do anything for her. She is the only person in the entire series who ever makes him smile.
-   Kerr Avon from _Blake's 7_, a cold and distant Anti-Hero who repeatedly insists that Love Is a Weakness and that he only cares about his own self-preservation. However said self-preservation goes flying out the window when it comes to love, to the extent of being willing to let himself be tortured for days simply to get vengeance for The Lost Lenore. He lampshades it after said Lost Lenore turns out to have been alive all along, and The Mole: "of all the things I have known myself to be, I never recognised the fool." It's worth noting he behaves very similarly toward his Vitriolic Best Bud Blake, repeatedly going to absurd lengths to save his life while insisting he has no affection for him whatsoever, adding a lot of Ho Yay to the series.

    Music 

-   "Earth Angel" (1954) by The Penguins, a more sweet and romantic take on it:
    
    Earth angel, earth angel  
    Will you be mine?  
    My darling dear  
    Love you all the time  
    I'm just a fool  
    A fool in love with you
    
-   "Why Do Fools Fall in Love?" (1956) by Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, which says that even if it puts you in a world of hurt, it's as natural as the birds singing and nobody can help it:
    
    Why do fools fall in love?  
    Why do birds sing so gay  
    And lovers await the break of the day  
    Why do they fall in love?  
    Why does the rain fall from up above?  
    Why do fools fall in love?  
    Why do they fall in love?
    
    Love is a losing game  
    Love can be a shame  
    I know, I'm a fool you see  
    For that fool is me
    
-   "Can't Help Falling in Love" by Elvis Presley, a rather more optimistic version:
    
    Wise men say only fools rush in  
    But I can't help falling in love with you  
    Shall I stay  
    Would it be a sin  
    If I can't help falling in love with you
    
    Like a river flows surely to the sea  
    Darling so it goes  
    Some things are meant to be  
    Take my hand, take my whole life too  
    For I can't help falling in love with you
    
-   "Fool for Love" performed by Sandy Rogers for the 1985 film _Fool for Love_, is a rather wistful tune about a guy who was a fool for love since the day he was born. First he's with a girl when they're six and seven, and he goes through puppy love. As he grows up he stays foolishly optimistic, and the last time the narrator sees him alive he's trying to break up a wedding.
    
    He grew up he didn't get much better  
    Tattooed underneath his sweater  
    L.O.V.E in blue  
    Seems he was never satisfied  
    Chasing girls like butterflies  
    Believin' every word they said was true  
    He's a fool for love  
    What he wouldn't do for love  
    He's a fool, a fool for love  
    Once a fool, you got to  
    Follow the rule, always a fool  
    A fool for love
    
-   Frank Sinatra has two songs in this vein on _Songs for Swingin' Lovers!_:
    
    -   "I've Got You Under My Skin"
    
    _I'd sacrifice anything come what might_
    
    _For the sake of havin' you near_
    
    _In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night_
    
    _And repeats, repeats in my ear:_
    
    _Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?_
    
    _Use your mentality, wake up to reality_
    
    _But each time that I do just the thought of you_
    
    _Makes me stop before I begin_
    
    _Cause I've got you under my skin_
    
    -   "You Make Me Feel So Young".
    
    _The moment that you speak_
    
    _I want to run and play hide-and-seek_
    
    _I want to go and bounce the moon_
    
    _Just like a big toy balloon_
    
    _You and I, we are just like a couple of tots_
    
    _Running along the meadow_
    
    _Picking up all those forget me nots_
    
-   Lord Huron's song "Fool for Love" is about a man challenging a rival to the death for the hand of a girl he loves. He ends up losing badly and getting likely fatally wounded, and though he admits he was an idiot to challenge a bigger, stronger man, he argues that there was no other choice due to this trope.
-   Ike and Tina Turner Revival's "A Fool in Love". A song about a woman questioning why she stays with a man who is rude and abusive to her. Becomes Harsher in Hindsight for obvious reasons, and ironically became one of the couple's biggest _hits_:
    
    _You're just a fool you know you're in love_
    
    _You've got to face it to let it explode_
    
    _You take the good along with the bad_
    
    _Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad_
    
    _You know you love him you can't understand_
    
    _Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man_
    
-   Rod Stewart's "Maggie May", released in 1971, is a semi-autobiographical song about a teenage boy who's in a relationship with an older woman. Even though he wonders Am I Just a Toy to You?, and figures breaking up with her would be the smart thing to do, he's still crazy about her and couldn't leave even if he tried.
    
    You made a first-class fool out of me
    
    But I'm as blind as a fool can be
    
    You stole my heart, but I love you anyway
    
-   Joe Jackson's "Fools in Love" is at the far end of the cynicism scale... up until it becomes clear the singer counts himself among the fools:
    
    Fools in love
    
    They think they're heroes
    
    'Cause they get to feel more pain
    
    I say fools in love are zeros
    
    I should know
    
    I should know because this fool's in love again
    

    Theatre 

-   Gretchen from _Jasper in Deadland_ has a rather negative opinion of life itself, and often implies that she prefers being dead and doesn't care about her Loss of Identity or losing the memories of her life. Despite this, she's immediately intrigued by Jasper's love for his lost "friend" Agnes, and ends up guiding Jasper through Deadland because she's falling in love with him.

    Western Animation 

-   _Samurai Jack_: Jack is often wary of entering romantic relationships because he doesn't want anything holding him back, and because of the trouble that follows (considering one incident which involved Aku deceiving him). When Ashi entered the picture, he eventually couldn't help falling in love with her the more he had her around. Nonetheless, he still understood the risk that this would carry, and didn't want to put her in danger.
