_"This world and everything in it now belong to darkness! They belong to my master!"_

Every good villain could use a sidekick. Just like The Hero has The Lancer, this character is the main villain's right-hand minion, their closest confidant (or something akin to it), frequently acts as their Foil, and may be seen working as the front-liner of the evil forces to personally carry out their master's orders as one of his most dangerous and competent subordinates. Sometimes The Dragon is the most active threatening villain in the story, which makes them The Heavy, while their boss makes orders from the shadows.

While The Dragon may be paired with a Big Bad, that does not make them a Big Bad Duumvirate, which requires the villains to be equals. However, a Duumvirate can have one or more Dragons of their own.

For literal dragons and their permutations, see Our Dragons Are Different. Not to be confused with the Dragon Lady (which describes a character stereotype, not a character's role).
