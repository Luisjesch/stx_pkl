**Harry:** Well Dick, maybe it's the office, you know. Maybe you're destined to fall in love with whoever you share the office with.  
**Dick:** That's ridiculous. If love worked that way, there'd be office romances all over the place. Businessmen having affairs with their secretaries, _please_!

Very often fiction that features characters in a work environment will have at least one instance of on the job romance. Sometimes it's within the rules, especially if both parties are at the same rank; however, it may be against the HR policy if one person is a boss, due to the power imbalance. Characters can get called on it, sent for HR training, or even get fired. If the pairing fails, there can be a lot of awkwardness in the aftermath, as they still have to work together. Sometimes if at-work couples aren't allowed, the pair may have to hide their affair.

It can be Truth in Television, although the "hot for supervisor" version is often forbidden in job rules to avoid ethical problems. If this does occur, one character may wind up changing shifts or departments or quitting the job. Some companies allow dating between colleagues of equal standing, although Hollywood likes to push things further with jobs like police work, where a romantic pairing would likely be a problem unless one partner changes departments.

This trope may be played differently in different cultures. Sometimes it may be even expected to happen. Some companies are aware that people want to show their best and most efficient side in front of a love interest.

Compare with Forbidden Fruit. See also Inappropriately Close Comrades, for relationships where the "office" is service in the military. See Sleeping with the Boss for when the relationship involves a boss or supervisor and a lower-level employee under him/her. If it's nonsexual close friendships formed at work, that's Found Family via Work.

No Real Life Examples, Please! as Real Life examples would fall under the sex tropes and morality tropes, which don't allow real life examples. As well, it could lead to speculative gossip and rumor-spreading, which leads to edit wars and disagreements. Another issue is that Real Life cases may involve legal issues (wrongful termination, sexual misconduct lawsuit, etc).

She screwed him over, stealing The Ice Truck Killer's prosthetic hand from the evidence room. He ended their relationship and he fired her as well.
    -   Notably, Angel and La Guerta get together, get married, and divorce in three separate off-screen incidents. This is a squicky example due to La Guerta being his direct superior, but she doesn't really flex it much in the relationship...though much of their on-screen development consists of the two bickering. This is a weird example of the trope as you could realistically remove the entire relationship from the show and nothing would change for better or worse.
-   _Scrubs_: Sacred Heart Hospital apparently has no policy whatsoever on this matter. Several people from their medical staff date each other and have steady relationships.

-   Dick and Mary on _3rd Rock from the Sun_. When a three-episode arc had a character played by Laurie Metcalf take Mary's place in the office, Dick started to fall for her.
    
    **Harry**: Well Dick, maybe it's the office, you know. Maybe you're destined to fall in love with whoever you share the office with.
    
    **Dick**: That's ridiculous. If love worked that way, there'd be office romances all over the place. Businessmen having affairs with their secretaries, _please_!
    
-   _Friends_:
    -   Ross dates an extremely hot woman who is pursuing a doctorate at Ross' department in the museum. The relationship doesn't work out because she is a disgustingly dirty hoarder and her apartment is one big pile of garbage.

Ross does all he can to defy Office Romance. It's later revealed that Mark indeed does find Rachel attractive and they have a date, but Mark already started to work elsewhere.
    -   When Ross starts teaching at the university, he once asked a linguist to be his plus one at a wedding. He's a palaeontologist so they work at different departments and there wouldn't be any tension. However, this relationship never went anywhere beyond that asking her out.
    -   Zig-Zagged. When Rachel works for Ralph Lauren, she starts a rumour that a woman was kissing with Ralph, the big man himself. It was her friend Phoebe (not working there, just using a xerox machine) and she actually kissed a copy guy who had lied to her. Rachel's boss is interested in the gossip but concludes that the kisser must have been Rachel herself and that she tries to advance her career, and hisses at Rachel that she better not try to steal _her_ job. They then encounter Lauren in the elevator: twice. Lauren never speaks besides greeting them, and Rachel's boss interprets the silence first as sexual tension and then, luckily for Rachel, as lack of interest. Rachel's boss later admits she herself had an office romance that ended badly — with the copy guy.
    -   Zig-Zagged with Rachel and Tag's relationship. Rachel was promoted and supposed to hire an assistant. She chose Tag who wasn't very suitable for the job but Rachel saw it as opportunity to spend time with him. She fretted because she couldn't date him, being his superior, but did all she could to prevent him from dating anybody else. For instance, she told him that all the women he had flirted with were gay. She invited him as a friend for their Thanksgiving dinner and blabbed that she liked him, but tried to take it back and say that it's just physical and doesn't want to pursue it.

    -   In last seasons, Ross has a crush on his gorgeous colleague Charlie who is also a paleontologist and works at the same department. She first dated his friend Joey which also complicated things.
    -   Ross and Charlie's relationship is ultimately ended when she returns to her ex who is suddenly the head of their department. He was evaluating applications for grants and Ross was seriously mistreated. The boss says he will get the grant if he lets Charlie go. Charlie somehow finds it romantic and decides to dump Ross and take her ex back.
-   _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_
    -   Detectives Jake Peralta and Amy Santiago both work at Precinct 99 of NYPD. It starts with Jake teasing Amy constantly and Amy being either annoyed or amused. Later Jake realizes he likes her for real; they have the classic will-they-won't-they tension, and both date other people. They later get together, agree to take it slowly and casually, but it's not working out — both want a serious relationship. The Vulture (their captain) tries to break them up (and he actually abuses his power of a superior because they are not breaking any rule). Once they screw up a case because they argue during a stakeout and blow up their cover. They date, then start living together, then Jake proposes, Amy says yes and they get married in season 5 finale. Amy is the more ambitious one and she becomes a sergeant and gets to be in charge of uniform police officers of 99.

    -   Gina (an assistant responsible for administrative stuff) and Boyle start having casual sex for awhile. They break it off with no hard feelings, but Gina is embarrassed when their colleagues find out about them.
    -   In Seasons 3-5, Rosa had this with Adrian Pimento, a detective who recently returned to the precinct after years undercover working for a violent New York mob boss. In contrast to Jake and Amy, they had a running gag of intense office PDA, managing to make _signing paperwork_ look steamy. After a forced separation and an attempted and then postponed wedding, Rosa eventually breaks up with him.
-   _Barney Miller_: Wojohowicz and recurring female detective Wentworth realize they are attracted to each other. Barney is OK with it, but just as long as it doesn't show up on the job nor affect their work. It gets "resolved" by Wentworth's character being dropped for no in-universe reason.
-   _JAG_:
    -   Bud Roberts falls in love with co-worker Harriet Sims, gets married, and are allowed to work in the same office because Harriet is, courtesy of Admiral Chegwidden, "temporarily assigned" to the office for several years...
    -   The Will They or Won't They? arc for nine seasons between Harm and Mac who are a pair of legal investigators of the US Navy.
-   _Monday Mornings_ is a medical drama created by David E. Kelley, and medical issues are brilliantly combined with legal matters. Chelsea General saw some relationships among the doctors, and one is potentially very dangerous for the hospital.
    -   Dr. Sydney Napur starts dating Dr. John Lieberman in the very first episode. They are from different departments, so there should be no conflict. It causes some tension between them because they see each other all the time, and Dr. Napur never stops working or thinking about medicine, and she meddles in Dr Lieberman's cases.
    -   Two brilliant and cocky neurosurgeons, Drs. Tina Ridgeway and Tyler Wilson, have a connection and lots of UST. She's married, though not very happily. Their supervisor often asks them about their personal lives, especially Dr. Ridgeway. He's worried that her almost-romance and marriage problems will affect her professional performance. She breaks up with her husband and the doctors later sleep together. Mark Ridgeway sues Dr. Wilson for breaking up his marriage. During their legal meeting, Dr. Wilson says that many doctors have love affairs and close relationships. The lawyer pricks up his ears and wants to hear more. Dr. Wilson's lawyer who also represents Chelsea General quickly ends up the meeting because he realizes that this could mean a major law suit and could harm the hospital.
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   Mulder and Scully, the legendary pair of insanely attractive FBI agents. Their relationship was purely platonic for a long time, but in season 7, they started an intimate relationship. Technically, Mulder lead the X-Files division, and was Scully's superior, but they were more or less equals. In the series finale, one jerk tells Scully that she was basically whoring around with her partner in an attempt to ruin her credibility. What an insult to their deep relationship.
        
        **Kallenbrunner:** Well, what I mean is, you have no proof to back up one word you just told us. Agent Scully, isn't it true that you and Mulder were lovers, and you got pregnant and had his love child?
        
    -   Agents Doggett and Reyes were a new pair at the bureau who investigated paranormal cases. The show was cancelled before we got to see the completion of their romance arc. They were definitely more proactive about their relationship than Mulder and Scully were.
    -   In "Aubrey", a female Detective has an affair with her Lieutenant who is married. She gets pregnant with him, but these are only minor problems. She starts channeling her grandfather who is a Serial Killer. She ended up suicidal and tried to abort her son.

-   On _Peep Show_, this is present from the pilot episode when Mark is pining after his coworker Sophie.

-   _Criminal Minds_:
    -   Kevin and Garcia work together and are the only ones who form a couple for many seasons (until they break up), but it's implied that it gets around the fraternization rules because while they both work for the FBI, they aren't on the same team and rarely need to work together on the same case.

-   _The Defenders (2017)_:
    -   In _Daredevil (2015)_, Nelson & Murdock is a three person firm (two lawyers, one secretary). Given the close quarters and small office space, that Karen Page gets involved with the partners is inevitable. In the first part of season 1, Foggy takes some level of interest in Karen, taking her out barhopping in "Cut Man", though their sole date in "World in Fire" is interrupted by Wilson Fisk blowing up a Russian mob hideout across the street. Towards the end of season 1, Foggy gets back together with his ex-girlfriend Marci Stahl after persuading her to help Nelson & Murdock bring down Fisk. Subsequently, Karen moves on to Matt Murdock. Throughout the first part of season 2, Karen regularly flirts with Matt whenever they're by themselves. She even dates him briefly, until the strain of his double-life as Daredevil causes him to falter in contributing to Frank Castle's trial and Karen stumbles upon Elektra in Matt's apartment and thinks he's cheating on her. While this drives them apart for most of the third act of the season (both because of that and their individual pursuits of the Hand and Frank Castle), in the final scene of season 2, Matt privately meets with Karen to reveal his secret identity, with the intent of reconciling.
    -   Foggy and Marci are in this position by the end of season 2 of _Daredevil (2015)_, due to Jeri Hogarth hiring both of them on at Hogarth Chao & Benowitz after their previous firms disbanded (Marci had left Landman & Zack after turning in her partners for aiding Wilson Fisk; Foggy had parted ways with Matt due to the strain of Matt's double life, and Jeri had been quite impressed by his opening statements in the Frank Castle trial). By season 3, they're living together again in a Williamsburg condo.
    -   On the subject of Jeri Hogarth, she has an office romance that ends in a worse fate. In _Jessica Jones (2015)_, she has an affair with her secretary Pam. This happens in the midst of a nasty divorce with her legal spouse Wendy. After unsuccessfully trying to use Jessica to dig up dirty information on Wendy to blackmail her, Jeri tries to have Kilgrave make Wendy agree to lesser terms. Unfortunately, Kilgrave is so disgusted by Jeri's actions as a lawyer and towards Wendy that he instead orders Wendy to kill Jeri with "Death by a Thousand Cuts". Wendy begins slicing at Jeri, but only makes it to 30 cuts when Pam comes in and fatally strikes Wendy over the head. Pam gets arrested and breaks up with Jeri, now seeing what type of person she truly is.

He believes that it will look bad for Marla's political career for him to be seen separated from her with a white woman.

After a Shotgun Wedding in Las Vegas, Leonard reveals he kissed a coworker, Mandy Chow, during the North Sea expedition he took a few years back. While Penny and Leonard weren't engaged at time, she later finds she can't stop thinking about it. He makes it worse when he lets slip that Mandy works at Caltech, making Penny uncomfortable.
