Once upon a time, there was pulp. Pulp was a style of writing that emerged onto the scene in the 1920s, featuring a variety of stories printed on cheap paper (hence "pulp"). Back in the day, pulp content ranged from the Cosmic Horror Stories of H. P. Lovecraft to the noir pieces of Raymond Chandler and from the over-the-top action of _Doc Savage_ to the Heroic Fantasy of _Conan the Barbarian_ and even the Raygun Gothic of Hugo Gernsback's Amazing Stories. The pulp era died down by the late '50s, when the leading distributor of pulp, the American News Company, went bankrupt, although there was a resurgence in the '60s and '70s in the form of the Darker and Edgier "men's adventure magazines", which straddled the line between pure pulp adventure and ostensibly-true Lurid Tales of Doom, all with a Rated M for Manly aesthetic. These are today best-remembered as things to read at the barber shop while you waited for your turn.

Then, people started looking back on the pulp era nostalgically, and when they did, they usually locked onto the over-the-top stories of Proto-Superhero characters like _The Shadow_, _Doc Savage_, and _The Phantom_. Many point to _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ and the sequel _Indiana Jones_ movies, which took 1930s pulp adventures as an inspiration, as the keystone of the pulp resurgence, but whatever kicked it off, pulp has recaptured the heart of many a geek.

Two-Fisted Tales refers to stories told in a style that reflects fondly on the old pulps. This usually means the story will be set in the '20s or '30s, and focus on square-jawed, clever men (and women) of action. Other elements thrown in for flavor include:

-   Attack of the Killer Whatever: The men's adventure subgenre had a lot of "man versus wilderness" narratives, in which Action Survivor heroes were tormented by animals ranging from the usual culprits like bears, big cats, sharks, and the like, to the truly improbable and harmless, as in the infamous _Man's Life_ story "Weasels Ripped My Flesh!" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Proto-Superhero motifs
-   Space Opera or Planetary Romance, where people get around in Retro Rockets and other Shiny-Looking Spaceships, and everything is smooth-lined and chrome-plated. You may also find Green Skinned Space Babes or outright Human Aliens, and the possibility of Boldly Coming is rarely far off. Combine this with the above Proto-Superhero and you get Captain Space, Defender of Earth!
-   Mad Science and/or Weird Science. Popular experiments for the those dabbling in these fields include a Man-Eating Plant, mucking about with Evolutionary Levels, or anything involving a Killer Gorilla
-   Bold Explorers discovering lost civilizations, usually including a Jungle Princess, Living Dinosaurs, and maybe a Temple of Doom or two. These are usually located either in a place considered "exotic" by western readers, such as a Hungry Jungle, Thirsty Desert, Mysterious Antarctica, or Beneath the Earth.
    -   Fanciful depictions of actual civilizations are also fairly common. Ancient Egypt, Darkest Africa, The Shangrila, and Mystical India have all been popular subjects. Expect a lot of Values Dissonance here, too: most of these stories (though not all) take it for granted that the world is a playground for white heroes to have adventures in. If the Evil Colonialist does show up as a villain, the emphasis will be put on his personal cruelty, rather than any systemic critique of colonialism itself. Odds are also good that he'll be from a country other than that of the assumed readers, thus drawing a distinction between the "bad, cruel" colonialism of the rival powers and the "good, humane" colonialism that we're doing (whoever "we" are)
-   Gangsters, usually of the type that wear pinstripe suits, call each other by crazy nicknames, and wield Tommy guns
-   The Yellow Peril, usually including a Dragon Lady
-   The occult. A lot of ideas from actual occult, pseudoscientific, and theosophical lore found their way into pop culture via pulp science fiction, so tropes like Landmark of Lore, Ancient Astronauts, a Sunken City, and the Hollow World fit right in here. Pulp is also the home of the Occult Detective.
-   Plenty of Nazis to be punched out. Most of them will be the source of, exploiting, or _trying_ to exploit either Mad / Weird Science or the Occult. In later material, Dirty Commies (often overlapping with the above Yellow Peril) would sometimes take their place.
-   Ace Pilots, either flying a Cool Plane, or, if it's a Space Opera, a Space Fighter
    -   Cool Airships were very big in the '30s, and turn up occasionally in pulp literature and film serials of that era, but have really found their niche in later Genre Throwbacks, where they became a shorthand for fanciful worlds where the pulp adventures never stopped. However, due to their associations with Germany, airships are far more likely to belong to the bad guys than the heroes.
-   Adventurer Outfits
-   During the War: Stories about military life or important battles were very popular. They'd usually emphasize the horrors of war, while at the same time celebrate the bravery of those who had endured it. Given when these magazines were being published, it was safe to assume most of the male readers were themselves veterans, so unflattering depictions of the boys in uniform were right out; this also meant these stories needed to be unusually well-researched.
-   Chandler American Time: The pre-war thirties is a popular time frame. As noted above, lots of this stuff was still being published well into the '70s, but even by then it had a very retro-'30s or '40s sensibility, as evidenced by the fact that Nazi villains remained a staple, whether the stories were period pieces set During the War or not.
-   Our Cryptids Are More Mysterious - Especially in the post-war pulps. The men's adventure subgenre in particular is often credited with bringing cryptids from the fringes of science and into mainstream pop culture. Bigfoot, Sasquatch, and Yeti were particularly common.
-   Wild Wilderness - The men's adventure pulps were often seen as the "outdoors" equivalent to the more "sophisticated", indoors magazines like _Playboy_. Their heroes were typically rugged, outdoorsy types living in small communities on the edge of the wilderness or leading safari tours into the Savage South, shipwrecked sailors in lifeboats or on some Deserted Island, or other varieties of tough guy on some kind of Robinsonade. This was the perfect environment to meet the improbably violent animals and cryptids mentioned above, though some of these stories would temper the carnage with a Green Aesop.

As stated above, Two-Fisted Tales don't often attempt to recapture the varied feel of all the old pulps; it's very rare you'll see someone trying to overlay the Doc Savage feel onto a Cthulhu story (not that it's impossible). Usually, it attempts to focus on the thrilling heroics, not that that's a bad thing.

While most works in the genre are not set during the interwar "pulp era" (though the occasional one, such as _The Treasure of the Sierra Madre_ \[1948\], is), The Western could be considered an inherently pulpy genre, thanks to it frequently featuring heightened reality, an exotic historical setting (often nostalgically rendered), double-fisted machismo, a sensationalistic tone, plenty of action and/or adventure, print-the-legend storytelling, larger-than-life mythmaking, and fairly clear lines of morality.

Related to Diesel Punk and Jungle Opera. Often the subject of a Genre Throwback. See also Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot, Twice-Told Tale which requires a specific tale. Also see Sword and Sorcery for a similarly campy style of adventure narrative that was popular around the same time.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Baccano!_, a Prohibition-era story with gangsters, serial killers and immortal alchemists, told in _Pulp Fiction_\-style Anachronic Order.

-   Part 2 of _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ takes place just before World War II, with a wisecracking Guile Hero protagonist taking on Nigh-Invulnerable super-vampires known as the Pillar Men. In an odd inversion, Those Wacky Nazis are actually on the _heroes_' side in trying to take out the Pillar Men (and one of them is transformed into a cyborg through **NAZI SCIENCE**!)

-   _A Centaur's Life_'s backstory includes a Lost World populated with snake-men, a modern Aztec empire, mass UFO sightings and neo-Nazis: not your average Slice of Life setting (even if you ignore the centaurs).
-   _Porco Rosso_ is a downplayed example, with a plot revolving around an Ace Pilot who hunts Sky Pirates during The Great Depression. However, this being a Studio Ghibli movie, the tone is a lot more introspective and pensive than this sort of story is normally about.

    Comic Books 

-   _Hellboy_ features elements of Two-Fisted Tales, with Nazis, evil monkeys, Weird Science, and the Golden Age crime-fighter Lobster Johnson. A spin-off series featuring Lobster Johnson has taken these elements and cranked them up to eleven.
-   _Planetary_ features Axel Brass, one of the universe's "Century Babies" and a Captain Ersatz of Doc Savage, who once headed up an entire secret society of Captain Ersatzes based on the pulp heroes of the era. His adventures and dealings with Elijah Snow are regularly chronicled.
-   _Tom Strong_ is Alan Moore's Reconstruction on everything that made those stories fun and noble.
-   Marvel's _Immortal Iron Fist_ is mostly a Kung Fu book, but features strong elements of pulp as well (especially with Orson Randall, the World War I era Iron Fist).
-   In 1997 DC Comics had a "Pulp Heroes" event, in which all their annuals were written in the style of the pulps. Ones that particularly fitted the Two-Fisted Tales paradigm were under the banners "My Greatest Adventure" and "Tales of the Unexpected". "Suspense Detective" also fitted to an extent, although that was more the Private Detective trope. "Young Romance" and "Weird Western Tales" were based on very different pulp genres.
-   The EC Comics title _Two-Fisted Tales_ began with stories of this genre but soon became a (much better) war comic.
-   _Atomic Robo_:
    -   Much of the series is a more modern-day take on this. The titular character is a snarky robot who has fought Nazi mad scientists, Lovecraftian horrors, and an intelligent dinosaur, visited different dimensions, and encountered the ghost of Rasputin.
    -   In-universe, Robo is a fan of Dirk Daring, the Daring Doer of Derring-Do, a radio program that is best enjoyed at certain (i.e. loud) volumes.
-   DC Comics' _First Wave_ imprint, a Two-Fisted Tales and Diesel Punk universe that includes Doc Savage, The Avenger, The Spirit and Rima the Jungle Girl, as well as DCU characters who fit the paradigm like Batman (who in this world is The Shadow, complete with twin guns) and Black Canary.
-   Dave Stevens's _The Rocketeer_ is a celebration of all kinds of Thirties and Forties tropes including this one, and so was the 1991 film adaptation.
-   Dominic Fortune, a 1930s "Brigand for Hire" in the Marvel Universe. Created by Howard Chaykin.
-   Parodied in _Tales Designed to Thrizzle_ with _Two-Fisted Poe_.
    
    Quoth the raven - **Lights Out!!!**
    
    -   Also, _The result of a confusing memo: Two-Tailed Fists!_ with a pair of confused gangsters attacked by giant fists with tails.

-   _The Goon_ is sort of a cross between this and supermarket tabloids. The Goon himself and his sidekick Franky are a pair of gangsters straight out of an old newspaper comic, who keep their city safe from zombies, mad science, eldritch abominations, sparkly vampires, and a whole Fantasy Kitchen Sink worth of weirdness.
-   The Captain America arc "The Bloodstone Hunt" is essentially this - Cap has to travel around the globe to exotic locations to get the five fragments of the Bloodstone before Baron Zemo can. Each location is essentially a pulp location in itself.
-   _Five Ghosts_ is a deliberately pulp adventure comic whose protagonist, Fabian Gray, is possessed by — and shares the abilities of — the ghosts of Miyamoto Musashi, Merlin, Sherlock Holmes, Dracula and Robin Hood. The covers often emulate EC Comics and other Golden Age titles, though the series itself is far less "meta" than _Tom Strong_ or _Planetary_.
-   Many Wolverine stories that aren't focused on more traditional superheroics are instead pulp-style adventures. In fact, the first 20 or so issues were almost all exclusively pulp stories, with Logan traveling around the seedier parts of the world and fighting supernatural villains. He also spent little time in his iconic costume, not even wearing it at all for the first two arcs.
-   Garth Ennis's run on _The Shadow_ is a full on Genre Deconstruction of Two-Fisted Tales. A romantic view of the pre-war Thirties is only possible by _intentionally_ ignoring the heinous war crimes committed by the Axis Powers, especially the Nanjing Massacre. A character in the series Lampshades this, saying he expected more of "rip-roaring" adventure in the Japanese-occupied China.
-   As part of _Secret Wars (2015)_ is _Where Monsters Dwell_ featuring the Golden Age character the Phantom Eagle, a Cool Plane, Amazons, and an Island of Mystery full of dinosaurs. It being another Garth Ennis piece, it's also a Deconstructive Parody, as the Eagle is a send up of these kinds of heroes; sexist, cowardly, and completely incompetent. It's The Not-Love Interest Clemmie who does all the heroic stuff (and who gets to have lots of sex with the Amazons.)
-   _DC Comics Bombshells_ puts the leading ladies of the DC Universe in World War II, fighting both Those Wacky Nazis and Eldritch Abominations.
-   _Adventureman_ by Matt Fraction, featuring an Expy of Doc Savage passing on his powers to a single mom and her sisters.
-   The DC Comics character Adam Strange has significant pulpy elements, namely that the title character is an archeologist who becomes a hero on an alien planet while romancing the daughter of the scientist who brought him there. Raygun Gothic design elements, and a Planetary Romance concept (that is clearly inspired by John Carter of Mars) make Adam one of the pulpiest of DC's heroes.
-   In _Astro City_, the Astro-Naut's adventures are of this nature, featuring an Ace Pilot waging Space Opera battles, fights against TheMafia, and Planetary Romance with the Green-Skinned Space Babe Xalzana, all exploring a thousand worlds in a sleek silver Proto-Superhero costume.

    Fanfiction 

-   The version of _Daring Do_ in _The Many Secret Origins of Scootaloo_'s eighth chapter is this trope. It centers around the sale of a legendary diamond in a mafia-owned cabaret, complete with gunfights and a young street urchin who helps out the heroes.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Missing Link_ is a throwback to the earlier pulps, in the final days of what would eventually be called Steampunk. A Gentleman Adventurer, the widow of his old rival, and a sasquatch go on a _Around the World in Eighty Days_\-style globetrotting adventure to the Himalayas in search of the yeti.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The _Indiana Jones_ movies, about an Adventurer Archaeologist traveling around the world, outwitting Nazi villains and excavating ancient temples, with some aspects of Diesel Punk.
-   _Star Wars_ was inspired by elements of the pulp series _Flash Gordon_ and was in fact originally intended to be a film adaptation of it.

-   _Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_ is a gleefully silly dieselpunk adventure full of mad science, daring aviators, and globetrotting adventure.

-   This trope is what _Pulp Fiction_ is named after, though in practice, it's more of a crime noir tale than anything from the old pulps.
-   Cult classic _The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension_, a purposeful homage of Doc Savage.
-   _The Adventures of The Librarian_ are a modern day pulp adventure spanning, to date, three films and a series.
-   _Captain America: The First Avenger_, what with gung-ho hero Cap and a group of Badass Normals fighting HYDRA, a splinter group of Those Wacky Nazis with Weird Science death machines powered by Asgardian magic.
-   _Flash Gordon_ is a very tongue-in-cheek and campy sci-fi adventure with a Raygun Gothic aesthetic, tons of very hammy acting (including a career-definingly loud performance from BRIAN BLESSED), and a kickin' Queen soundtrack.
-   Amicus Productions made four Edgar Rice Burroughs\-inspired movies in the mid to late '70s, staring Doug McClure and featuring big rubber monsters, lost worlds, and insanely gorgeous women. Three of these - _The Land That Time Forgot_, _The People That Time Forgot_, and _At The Earths Core_ - are straight adaptations of Burroughs novels (see below under Literature), while the fourth, _Warlords Of Atlantis_, was an original story that nonetheless captured the tone of a Burroughs novel.
-   Hammer Films got in on this too in the '70s, with movies like _The Lost Continent_, a movie about the crew and passengers of a ship getting stuck in the Sargasso Sea, and encountering sea monsters and a lost civilization descended from Spanish conquistadores, most of which is shamelessly cribbed from William Hope Hodgson's _The Boats Of The Glen Carrig_. Their development process for these seemed to start by designing a really cool poster, and then trying to write a movie around it. One movie that, alas, never got past the poster was the simply-titled _Zeppelin v. Pterodactyls<small>◊</small>_.
-   _One Million Years B.C._, a joyfully silly cavemen-and-dinosaurs movie featuring Raquel Welch as probably the single most iconic Nubile Savage in pop culture history, being menaced by an entire menagerie of Ray Harryhausen beasties.
-   _Jumanji_ is a franchise all about a sapient magical game based on a Jungle Opera setting from exactly this kind of genre. The second film takes this even further, with every player sucked into the game and given new avatars based on five stereotypical heroes from a jungle-exploring two-fisted tale.
-   _The Mummy Trilogy_ is a trilogy of exactly this kind of story, being largely an action adventure series with the supernatural giving it more of a horror element than most. Taking its title and most of its plot cues from _The Mummy (1932)_, it has more in common tonally with _The Mummy's Hand_, a 1940s semi-reboot that also belongs squarely in this genre.
-   _The Mummy's Hand_ and its sequels codified the trope of a mummy as a shambling, mute Implacable Man who likes to strangle people with their recurring villain Kharis and his repeated run-ins with a family of Adventurer Archaeologists.
-   _Creature from the Black Lagoon_ is another Universal Horror movie that edges into this trope, with a jungle expedition running afoul of a very lonely fish-man.
    -   _Revenge of the Creature_, is a fairly by-the-numbers Escaped Animal Rampage story. The second sequel, _The Creature Walks Among Us_, however, amps the strangeness back up with more Weird Science and elements of Film Noir.
-   _Overlord (2018)_ is probably the closest thing we'll ever get to a _Wolfenstein_ movie. It's a pulp take on World War II, with square-jawed American paratroopers infiltrating a German-held fortress full of gruesome Nazi science.
-   _The Rocketeer_ is another affectionate homage to the two-fisted tales of yesteryear, starring an adventurous pilot, an experimental jetpack, and Those Wacky Nazis.
-   The MonsterVerse movies mix some of this flavour in with all the kaiju action, particularly in the films featuring Kong: _Kong: Skull Island_ is a Lost World adventure set in The '70s, and in _Godzilla vs. Kong_, the big ape travels to an even _lost-er_ world Beneath the Earth, where he finds a gigantic axe that basically turns him into a 335-foot tall Barbarian Hero.
-   _The Abominable Dr. Phibes_ is a horror-comedy version of this, with its Mad Scientist title character lurking in a spectacular Art Deco mansion and terrorizing 1920s London, alongside his band of clockwork musicians. Taken even further in the sequel, _Dr. Phibes Rises Again_, where Phibes travels to Egypt and gets into a race with an Adventurer Archaeologist to find an ancient tomb that can grant eternal life.
-   The Pre-Code classic _Island of Lost Souls_ (1932) could be considered one of the quintessential pulp horror movies (though it also has a fair amount of pulp adventure, as well), being about a shipwrecked sailor (Richard Arlen) who finds himself trapped on a South Seas island ruled by mad scientist Dr. Moreau (Charles Laughton). Based on the book _The Island of Doctor Moreau_ by H. G. Wells, it's a still-chilling example of the scarier side of pulp fiction with its lurid horror and exotic locales.
-   Based on a short story of the same title by Richard Connell, _The Most Dangerous Game_ (1932) is a Pre-Code fusion of pulp action-adventure and pulp horror about a shipwreck survivor (Joel McCrea) who finds himself trapped on a remote island controlled by a mad count (Leslie Banks) who's taken game-hunting to the next level. It has heroic action and sensationalistic horror.
-   The landmark Pre-Code action-adventure movie _King Kong (1933)_ is an important work of pulp, being about a giant ape who's discovered by a film crew on an uncharted island. It's got the over-the-top action, awe at the exotic, and fearless adventuring associated with pulp fiction.
-   _Batman (1989)_ largely falls into this style with its pulp-noir aesthetic. The film, about superhero Batman (Michael Keaton) fighting to prevent clown gangster the Joker (Jack Nicholson) from terrorizing Gotham City, is set in an Ambiguous Time Period with some The '40s\-style touches in the costumes and architecture. The sequel, _Batman Returns_ (1992), mixes in some 1920s German Expressionism stylings, with a few aspects of Gothic Horror.
-   The action-adventure-western _Blowing Wild_ (1953) is about a group of oilmen (Gary Cooper, Anthony Quinn, and Ward Bond) struggling to survive in bandit-infested territory in South America. It's presumably set about the time of its release and has pulpy thrills and macho content.
-   The silent gangster movie _The Penalty_ (1920) is about mobster Blizzard (Lon Chaney), who unnecessarily had both of his legs amputated as a child, and now plots his revenge on the mistaken doctor (Charles Clary) and the city of San Francisco as a whole. While not a pulp film of the rock-'em-sock-'em action-adventure variety, it's still a crime-drama-thriller with sensationalistic elements, like the main character's secret lair, complete with an arsenal and operating room, that's accessible through a secret entrance in a fireplace, and a lurid, morbid plot.
-   While not as over-the-top as some stories of the pulp aesthetic, _The Untouchables (1987)_ checks many of the boxes for its inclusion here, being a heightened, action-oriented, exciting, and somewhat exaggerated take on a team of lawmen (Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Andy García, and Charles Martin Smith) trying to take down the Chicago crime empire of Al Capone (Robert De Niro) during Prohibition.
-   The Tarzan movies starring Johnny Weissmuller are certainly very pulpy, especially the first two, Pre-Code ones - _Tarzan the Ape Man (1932)_ and _Tarzan and His Mate_ (1934). They're full of exotic locations, heroic derring-do, and high adventure.
-   Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in two fantasy-action-adventure movies based on the pulp character Conan the Barbarian (originally created by Robert E. Howard): _Conan the Barbarian (1982)_ and _Conan the Destroyer_ (1984). These two Heroic Fantasy films, set in a prehistoric dark age, feature hyper-macho heroics, sadistic villainy, and wild action. The intro to the 1982 work, voiced by Mako, even promises to "tell you of the days of high adventure."
-   It's much more grounded than many other pulp works (no fantasy elements here), but _Dillinger (1973)_ is a highly pulpy gangster actioner that tells a print-the-legend version of the biography of iconic Great Depression-era bank robber John Dillinger (Warren Oates). It has over-the-top shootouts, tough-talking dialogue, an interwar setting, and storytelling that greatly amplifies the excitement of the John Dillinger story.
-   _The Seventh Curse_ is a Hong Kong Horror Comedy take on this, with a practicing MD who moonlights as a badass action hero getting sucked into a jungle adventure involving Blood Magic, Human Sacrifice, and demons. It plays out like a mix of _Indiana Jones_ and _The Evil Dead (1981)_, but with more martial arts.
-   _Zathura_ exchanges the jungle setting from its spiritual predecessor _Jumanji_ for a Flash Gordon-style Raygun Gothic atmosphere. Both are based off of books by Chris Van Allsburg; in fact, the Zathura book was a direct sequel to the Jumanji one.

    Literature 

-   _Andrew Doran_: Andrew Doran is a Doc Savage-esque Genius Bruiser and square-jawed hero, even if he's more obnoxious and prideful than the majority of pulp heroes. He's up against Nazis, evil cultists, and monsters. The books are done in a deliberate episodic pulpy style reminiscent of older serialized fiction.
-   _Books Of Cthulhu_: The anthology books take a very Pulp hero version of Lovecraft's tales with protagonists that are unafraid to oppose the various cultists as well as forces threatening the world. Occassionally subverted where the protagonists Broke Your Arm Punching Out Cthulhu.
-   The work of Edgar Rice Burroughs, providing some of the definitive examples of some of this trope's subgenres.
    -   Tarzan, his most famous character, is one of the definitive pulp heroes, practically defining the Jungle Opera subgenre: Tarzan is a man raised by apes to become king of the jungle - basically what you'd get if Mowgli were an action hero. His stories are full of lost cities and grand adventure.
    -   _The Land That Time Forgot_ and its sequels tell a classic Lost World tale of dinosaurs, feuding tribes of cavemen, volcanic eruptions, and a square-jawed American hero (played by Doug McClure in the movie) who must sort it all out.
    -   The _Pellucidar_ series is basically a pulp adventure take on _Journey to the Center of the Earth_, with a Lost World Beneath the Earth full of good-looking primitive humans, diabolical monsters, plenty of dinosaurs, and a different square-jawed American hero (though one also played by Doug McClure in the movie) who must sort it all out.
    -   The _John Carter of Mars_ novels are classic Planetary Romance works, with a richly-drawn world of trackless desert, proud warrior race guys, Weird Science, daring escapes, heroic rescues, airship battles, sword fights, and a square-jawed American hero (whom, sadly, Doug McClure never got to play) who must sort it all out.
-   Philip José Farmer's long writing career is marked by his great love of the pulps and he devoted great energy to his many Two-Fisted Tales. Even his works which aren't in the genre are often informed by it. _Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life_ provides a biography of the pulp era hero and links him to other period heroes.
-   _The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril_ has the authors of Doc Savage and The Shadow looking into the murder of H. P. Lovecraft and uncovering a global conspiracy.
-   _The Takers_ is an _Indiana Jones_\-style homage novel by Jerry Ahern, about an action-adventure novelist and his Love Interest — an Intrepid Reporter who investigates wacky UFO and occult stories — who team up to investigate the murder of a CIA agent, and the log of a 19th Century expedition searching for Atlantis. It manages to work in Pirates, Ancient Astronauts, Mysterious Antarctica, Flying Saucers, Those Wacky Nazis, a Diabolical Mastermind and his Psycho Knife Nut daughter, and a nuclear submarine!
-   Kim Newman's Dr. Shade ... sometimes. Some of the stories featuring him are celebrations of the pulps and others (most especially "The Original Dr Shade") are Deconstructions. Also by Newman but not featuring Dr Shade: the Diogenes Club story "Clubland Heroes" (definitely a Deconstruction).
-   Zach Parsons specifically called his book _My Tank is Fight!_ an example of "two fisted pulp history", with a title taken from a punk rock song by The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets. It describes the development and hypothetical use of various WW2 super/strange weapons that never quite made it past the prototype stage (if they made it that far at all).
-   The _Gabriel Hunt_ books, although set in modern times.
-   In a more lighthearted variant, the _Doc Wilde_ series. Doc even brings his kids along on his adventures.

-   The novel _Gods of Manhattan_, in the _Pax Britannia_ series of Steampunk novels, features two-fisted adventurer Doc Thunder (Savage, with elements of Hugo Danner and Superman), and killer vigilante Blood Spider (the Spider, with elements of the Shadow), amongst others.
-   Lagadin's Legacy belongs to the genre in that it features elements of the Indiana Jones-style adventure story, but also tries to subvert it by including elements of thriller, mystery, and satire.

-   The _Bernice Summerfield_ novel _Down_ by Lawrence Miles features "Mr Misnomer, the Man of Chrome", who Benny knows for a fact is a fictional character from 24th century "pulpzines". It also features a hollow world full of dinosaurs, a Nazi villain, a mad computer and all the usual stuff. Turns out to be a deconstruction.
-   "Adventure Story" by Neil Gaiman is narrated by the son of a WWII soldier who had this type of experience post-war.
-   The _Ciaphas Cain_ books follow this style, with the added twist that the narrator protagonist keeps insisting his acts of daring-do are misinterpretations or just what was necessary to survive.
-   Mark Stephen Rainey's _Blue Devil Island_ featuring the Blue Devil Squadron facing off against an Eldritch Abomination in the South Pacific during World War II.
-   The _Captain Riley_ series by Fernando Gamboa, featuring a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits on a Cool Boat fighting (who else?) Those Wacky Nazis.

-   Biggles had a few adventures that dabbled in this genre between the wars. It looked as though he were going to end up doing the same thing again after the Second World War, but instead he got a job offer from a comrade in arms who'd gone back to his prewar career as a police inspector, and spent the next decade or so being Biggles of the Yard instead.
-   In the _Wax and Wayne_ series, interludes in the book parts have snippets of the in-universe "broadsheets" featuring headlines, advertisements, and bits of pulp fiction stories. The most recurring being the (heavily embellished) real life adventures of "Allomancer Jak".
-   Publisher and editor Robert Deis has released a whole series of anthology books collecting stories originally published in men's adventure magazines. They include such attention-grabbing titles as:
    -   _Weasels Ripped My Flesh!_: A grab bag of multiple subgenres.
    -   _Cuba: Sugar, Sex, and Slaughter_: All stories that involve Castro and the Cuban Revolution.
    -   _Cryptozoology Anthology_: Stories and articles about cryptids.
    -   _I Watched Them Eat Me Alive!_: Animal attack stories.
    -   _Maneater_: More animal attack stories, but specifically Threatening Shark stories.
    -   _Atomic Werewolves and Man-Eating Plants_: When the men's adventure stuff overlapped with weird fiction, bringing us the occult, Hollywood Satanism, more cryptids, and aliens.
    -   _The Naked and the Deadly_: A collection of stories by Lawrence Block, most of which skew towards Detective Fiction and the noirish.
    -   _Handful of Hell_: All stories by prolific writer Robert F. Dorr, nearly all of which are military fiction.
    -   _He-Men, Bag-Men, and Nymphos_: Stories by Walter Kaylin, ranging from the noirish to Nazisploitation to Spy Fiction, but all of them extremely over-the-top, violent, and horny.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The X-Files_ episode "Triangle" had elements of this, especially the big ballroom punch-up between British sailors and Nazi goons, not to mention Scully as a glamorous 1930s spy in a red dress.
-   _Tales of the Gold Monkey_, a short-lived Belisarius series featuring Ace Pilot Jake Cutter and his adventures in the South Pacific in 1938.
-   _Bring 'Em Back Alive_, which dueled with the above and ended up about as short-lived.
-   _Danger 5_ brings more of a '60s flavour to this, pastiching the goofy Pulp Magazines of the decade. Despite its very '60s aesthetic, however, it's set during World War II and features a very silly Hitler as its Big Bad.
    -   The second series carries it further with an over-the-top neon-lit Cannon\-esque version of The '80s, with every episode ending in a toy commercial - except that it's actually set during the '60s, with figures like Perron, Kruschev, and Skorzeny running around.
-   _Doctor Who_ has this as one of its stock Genre Roulette settings, especially during the Classic series. Many of the William Hartnell\-era stories harken back to boy's adventure stories of the '30s and '40s, from "The Daleks" (which has a heavy _Dan Dare_ vibe) to "The Smugglers" (pirates and Swashbuckling). Season 13 and 14 (the "Gothic Horror" period) are a particularly good period to find them in - there's a Raygun Gothic detective story, a Fu Manchu Expy, and a Who Shot JFK? conspiracy thriller; a Darker and Edgier, Bloodier and Gorier, slightly Hotter and Sexier and more 'pastiche-y' tone; and the introduction of a sexy jungle-girl companion inspired by 1900s pulp. Some show up earlier and later than this - bizarrely, "City of Death" was intended to be one, but then someone got the bright idea of asking Douglas Adams to write it.

-   This is _Decoder Ring Theatre_'s entire schtick, with both of their main series, _Red Panda Adventures_ and _Black Jack Justice_, being heavily influenced by this style.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Achtung! Cthulhu_ is taking all the WW2 and post-war pulps about punching Those Wacky Nazis and disrupting their wicked schemes and gives them a ride through the Cthulhu Mythos country.
-   White Wolf's _Adventure!_.
-   _Crimefighters_ is a pulp-themed, role-playing tabletop game from 1981. It emulates the quests of popular Crime and Detective pulp characters (such as Doc Savage, the Shadow, and Agent X-9) against criminal masterminds. The game presents three character classes: the Defender, an in-universe Lawful Good that fights crime and gains experience by capturing, not killing, offenders; the Avenger, an in-universe Chaotic Good with a penchant for vigilantism and therefore gains experience points by killing criminals; and the Pragmatist, in-universe Neutral Good, that usually abides by the law but is willing to break it in order to bring villains to justice.
-   _Crimson Skies_, later adapted into a series of PC and Xbox games, focuses heavily on the Zeppelins and Sky Pirates aspect of pulp.
-   The _Dark Sun_ campaign setting for _Dungeons & Dragons_ is directly based off of old pulp fantasy classics like _Conan the Barbarian_.
-   The _Eberron_ campaign setting for _Dungeons & Dragons_ combines this with Dungeon Punk.
-   _Fists & .45s_ was created by dredging out few cardboard boxes of old pulps and then trying to work them out into a game. Unlike most cases, this game is heavy on the actual content of the pulps, rather than their aesthetics alone, only adding to the craziness.
-   _Fortune and Glory_, one of many Adventure Board Games by Fighting Frog Games: players take on the roles of pulp archetypes - an Ace Pilot, an Intrepid Reporter, a Mad Scientist, a Great White Hunter - in a globe-trotting adventure to recover mystical artifacts before a Nebulous Evil Organization (In addition to Those Wacky Nazis, we have The Mafia and a Religion of Evil) gets them first.
-   _Gear Krieg_ is very much this at heart, even with the Diesel Punk trappings.
-   _Genius: The Transgression_ gives detailed instructions on how to create a pulp tale in the sourcebook.
-   _GURPS_ is generic enough to handle the setting, as seen in _GURPS Cliffhangers_ and _GURPS Thaumatology: Age of Gold_.
-   _Hollow Earth Expedition_ is made of this, to the point its mechanics were build from ground-up toward larger than life heroes doing crazy stunts and simply powering through lesser or trivial obstacles. Large section of the core rulebook is dedicated to explaining in detail how to recapture the feel of a Film Serial in your own scenario, too.
-   Many adventures had by the Sons of Ether in _Mage: The Ascension_, whose Tradition is chock-full of people with names like "Doc Eon" and "the Crimson Claw." Taking an appropriately two-fisted nickname seems to be standard even if you don't use it often.
-   The _Pulp Cthulhu_ supplement for _Call of Cthulhu_ does this to the parent game, turning the fraidy investigators to pulp heroes by tweaking the game rules, and adding weird science in mix with the traditional Lovecraftian setting, resulting a setting where insane adventurer is bad news... For the adversaries!
-   _Pulp Hero_ for the HERO System.
    -   And its earlier incarnation _Justice, Inc._
-   The _Pulp Heroes_ setting in d20 Past, full of dashing aviators and mad Nazi science.
-   _Rocket Age_ is intended to have a pulpy, heroic play-style, in a Raygun Gothic Space Opera setting. It even has a story point system to let you manipulate the plot and pull off almost impossible stunts and bluffs.
-   If _Savage Worlds_ can be said to have a "default setting," it's this. One of the first supplements was a Pulp Toolkit, and the whole system's emphasis on "Fast Furious Fun!" leads to a very pulpy game experience.
    -   The supplement/source book Thrilling Tales all the way.
-   _Spirit of the Century_
-   _Two-Fisted Tales_ from Precis Intermedia Games

    Video Games 

-   The _Uncharted_ series. Set in modern times, but all the elements are there: Indiana Jones-esque hero, lots of bad guys to fight in the middle of a war, exotic locations to visit, women to rescue (and be rescued by), betrayal, and the overall theme. It's essentially the playable form of a pulp hero story.
-   The _Wolfenstein_ series also seems to have elements of this. You're a one-man army during WWII, stopping the Nazis from taking over the world with either hi-tech weaponry or taking the supernatural to their advantage. The third game even has a final level on a zeppelin.
-   The Ultima _Worlds of Adventure_ spin-offs, _Worlds of Ultima: The Savage Empire_ and _Martian Dreams_.
-   _Bulletstorm_ embraces this demeanor, down to the unlikable but heroic lead.
-   Parodied in _Team Fortress 2_ with Saxton Hale, a pulp protagonist who owns the company that makes all of the characters' weapons.
-   _Valiant Hearts_ deconstructs this by placing it in the real-world context of World War 1. The early game focuses on the Ragtag Bunch of Misfits tracking down a Diabolical German Baron who has kidnapped Anna's Reluctant Mad Scientist father and used his genius to engineer devastating super-weapons in the name of German Imperialism. However, even once the apparent Big Bad is defeated, the War itself continues on and the game shifts focus to the Gray-and-Grey Morality of the situation and the extreme personal toll of the war on the protagonists.
-   An arcade game called _The Cliffhanger: Edward Randy_. Staring a dashing whip-wielding protagonist, you do things like fend off enemies on speeding motorboats, run away from huge demolition trucks and fight a boss on the wings of a plane.
-   The _Pulp Adventures_ mod for _Freedom Force vs The Third Reich_ is a total conversion mod which changes the original game into a homage to pulp stories, with a brand new campaign featuring "Nazi punching! Dinosaur wrangling! Two-fisted action galore!", and a roster of 25 available heroes such as Doc Savage, Indiana Jones, the Rocketeer, Tarzan, Dick Tracy...
-   _Pathway_, a Roguelike/Turn-Based Tactics game set in North Africa and Middle-East during the 1930s, where you lead a multinational team of adventurers whose goal is to prevent Nazi occultists to gain archaeological treasures.
-   The _Earnest Evans_ trilogy. The titular Evans is a clear _Indiana Jones_ homage (though despite the name, Evans is only playable in _one_ game in the trilogy,) and the series has the cast dealing with Roaring Twenties\-era gangsters, ancient magic, plenty of globe-trotting to ancient ruins, and a plot to resurrect Hastur.

    Web Comics 

-   _Athena Voltaire_, a rare example of a female lead pulp story.
-   _Girl Genius_ is based strongly off pulpy stories of juvenile adventurers like Tom Swift and Jonny Quest.
    -   In-universe, the Heterodyne stories, (often exaggerated) tales about the adventures of heroes Bill and Barry Heterodyne, are enormously popular.
-   The currently comatose "Modern Pulp" webcomic site, especially _Sprecken_, about a 1930s crimefighter (who used to go by "Mr Midnight") relocated to the 2020s.
-   _Semi-Auto Semla_ is a webcomic that seeks to emulate the genre and the tone, complete with the gratuitous numbers of damsels in distress and heavy-duty action.

    Web Original 

    Western Animation 

-   _Jonny Quest_ contains elements of this. By extension, often _The Venture Bros._ parodies this since it is a parody of _Jonny Quest_.
-   _TaleSpin_ transposed characters from _The Jungle Book_ into this kind of adventure setting, with Baloo as an Ace Pilot in a 1930s-inspired World of Funny Animals.

-   Through a degree of separation (it's ostensibly based on Hanna-Barbera cartoons such as _Jonny Quest_), _The Secret Saturdays_, which is what happens when the heroes of Two-Fisted Tales settle down. Weird science, exotic locations, and the patriarch of the family is even named Doc (and could pass for Savage in the right light).
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   The _Daring Do_ series of Books Within a Show, which is heavily based on _Indiana Jones_, in the episode "Read it and Weep".
    -   As does wherever the hell in Equestria the plot of "Daring Don't" takes place, which reveals all the stuff she writes about _actually happens_.
-   _DuckTales (1987)_ solved mysteries and rewrote history every episode. The revival show takes it up a notch.
-   _Archer Danger Island_ takes the characters of parent series _Archer_ and dumps them, in one of Archer's Adventures in Comaland, into 1938 on the titular Danger Island: a tropical, French-colonial island with cannibal natives, Nazis, volcanoes, Archer trying to pilot a crude plane, and all sorts of wild adventures.
-   The animated series _The Adventures of Tintin (1991)_ is a part of the Tintin franchise that has the titular hero-reporter (and his dog, Snowy) setting off on highly pulpy globetrotting adventures.
-   _The Adventures of Tintin (2011)_, a computer-animated movie, is based on three Tintin stories: _The Crab with the Golden Claws_, _The Secret of the Unicorn_, and _Red Rackham's Treasure_. Pulpy elements include high adventure, manic action, pirates, exotic locales, lost treasure, and an intrepid hero.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_ has many elements of pulp-noir, with masked superhero Batman battling supervillains and gangsters who threaten Gotham City. "Dark deco" aesthetics are prominent and the storytelling is moody and heightened.
