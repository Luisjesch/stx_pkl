_"...after having heard the explosion from their practice facility they ran into the fire to help get people out... ran into the fire."_

— **Bartlet**, _The West Wing_, "20 Hours in America, Part II"

A common way for a work to show a character is heroic is by having them putting themselves in harm's way to rescue others, and the fire rescue is a classic example (which is another reason why Firemen Are Hot). The fire might be a burning building, or car, or any other fire in general, but generally it will threaten the life of the character who enters it. Expect it to happen regularly in a work focused on firefighters.

A subversion sometimes occurs where a character will attempt to invoke this trope by setting the fire themselves, and then enter into it to rescue someone, hoping to come off as a hero. Usually this will backfire spectacularly. The character in this case is engaging in Engineered Heroics, and likely to be an actual villain.

Can be used as an Establishing Character Moment, Rescue Introduction or to kickstart a Rescue Romance. If the character is already shown as being heroic, it can be used to underline their Chronic Hero Syndrome.

Please Don't Try This at Home, as you're more likely to end up needing to be rescued yourself... if you even survive.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Ask Dr. Rin!_, when Tokiwa was still in his Yandere phase, one of his attempts to woo Meirin involved using his shikigami to set her school on fire while she was trapped in one of the rooms. His plan was to invoke this trope, even though he set the building on fire in the first place. Naturally, Asuka managed to show up and rescue her first.
-   Subverted in _Digimon Ghost Game_. Terrifying Rescuers DarkLizardmon & Saberdramon attempt one of these using DarkLizardmon's special attack Dark Flare, which creates a protective zone that incinerates anything trying to leave. The man they attempted to rescue is too scared to listen to their instructions and dashes outside, resulting in him slowly being burned to death by Dark Flare in front of his family and neighbors.
-   _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ opens with the post-Time Skip Aces assisting the firefighters in containing a large airport fire, though only Nanoha and Fate actually go in to evacuate the victims, while Hayate coordinates the efforts from the outside. Nanoha's rescue of Subaru, the seasons' central new character, becomes the turning point in the latter's life, motivating her to pursue a mage's career to be more like her new idol. Simultaneously subverted in the case of Subaru's sister Ginga, who tries to rescue her on her own but almost dies and instead has to be rescued by Fate. The method which Nanoha uses to rescue Subaru also ends up being a Chekhov's Skill for the final battle (on top of Subaru being mostly unaffected by the inferno being the first bit of foreshadowing towards her cyborg nature).
-   In _Pandemonium Wizard Village_, Brow accidentally causes a massive fire by improperly setting off the firework he stole from Zipher, leaving him in the middle of it. Zipher rushes in to rescue him. While this is happening, we are shown a flashback of him trying to do the same to his lover, Anna, when Arkhamheim is being razed by the Sky Golems. He was unsuccessful in saving her, but he does manage to save Brow, though he loses his left eye in the process.
-   Happens every so often in _Pokémon: The Series_. One notable example is Ash rushing into the burning Celadon Gym to save Erika's Gloom, thus earning himself the Rainbow Badge. Also seen with Water-type turtle Pokémon (Squirtle, Wartortle, and Blastoise) who are specially trained for this.
-   Twice over in _Rainbow_ when the detention center catches fire while most of the protagonists are locked in their cell. First, Anchan rushes in, determined to force the door, and winds up needing to be rescued himself. Then Scam rushes in, having found the key, and saves the others, who then save Anchan.
-   In the _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_ chapter about misplaced priorities, student Mansebashi-kun rushes into the burning house where his little sister is screaming for help... to rescue his anime merchandise. His mother slaps him after a firefighter rescues the girl.
-   This is an extremely regular occurrence in _Tomica Hyper Rescue Drive Head Kidou Kyuukyuu Keisatsu_. Even the show itself mentions that fires are the most likely disaster. Typically, Taiga and his Drive Head Backdraft, which specializes in firefighting, will have a big part in stopping major fires.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, Yugi is trapped in a warehouse and forced to duel a brainwashed Bandit Keith over who gets the Millenium Puzzle. After Bakura sets Keith free, he snaps out of his brainwashing, but only temporarily as Marik makes him smash the Puzzle to pieces, much to Yugi's terror. Bakura then knocks Keith out and "helps" Yugi put the Puzzle back together. Keith then wakes up and snaps, not only out of his brainwashing completely, but accidentally setting the warehouse on fire, which leads to Jonouchi / Joey and Honda / Tristan having to save Yugi despite his objections of never letting go of the Puzzle.
    -   The _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ manga has a similar but very different scenario in the Dungeon Dice Monsters arc. This time the fire was caused by Mr. Otogi knocking over a candle when trying to solve the Millennium Puzzle and going insane. While Yugi tries to solve puzzle while in the fire, all Yugi's friends evacuate the building except for Jonouchi, who waits inside for Yugi to solve the Puzzle. When Yugi passes out after solving it, Jonouchi carries Yugi out of the still burning building.

    Asian Animation 

-   In _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: Joys of Seasons_ episode 6, Weslie, Paddi, and Sparky all become firemen, and the climax of the episode has them take on the job of extinguishing a big fire in Wolf Castle that was deliberately started by Wolffy in an attempt to capture them. Weslie is just about to rescue Wolffy and Wolnie when Paddi and Sparky's fire extinguishers run empty, forcing them to go refill them. Weslie tells Wolffy he'll be back to rescue him and Wolnie soon... except the episode ends without him coming back, thus subverting the trope.

    Comic Books

-   _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_: In "Vacation Time", a Donald Duck comic by Carl Barks, Donald manages to save himself and his nephews from a forest fire started by a careless camper. Worth noting is that up until this point, Donald has mostly been playing the fool, trying (and failing) to get a perfect photograph of a majestic deer. But once the fire starts, he takes charge. And he tells the kids to soak their shirts in water and put their shirts over their faces after which he buries them, each with a shovel over their face so they can breath, and afterwards burying himself. They survive, of course, but the forest is left in tragic ruins.
-   In _The Transformers (Marvel)_ UK's Timeline, part-time firetruck Inferno leaps to assist human firefighters struggling to put out a blaze caused by a bomb. While the humans are able to get most of the victims free, a boy is stranded because the fire near him is too intense for the firefighters to approach, Inferno, being Cybertronian and covered with armored metal skin functionally immune to any heat below 8000 degrees Celsius, dives into the burning building and emerges carrying the boy Out of the Inferno.

This doesn't stop her from assisting Bucky's aunt Agatha with various chores in her home.
-   In the ninth chapter of the _Rango_ fanfic _Old West_, the Convenient Store of Mud (the new name of Dirt) is set ablaze and the store owner's wife and baby are trapped upstairs.

    Literature 

-   How Jonatan dies in the beginning of _The Brothers Lionheart_.

He was a heavy drinker, chased after woman all the time, loved to gamble and was able to charm his way out of any kind of trouble (which he frequently got in). He died rescuing children from a burning building; in fact, he died because he kept going back to look for more people and the roof collapsed on him.

-   _Body of Proof_ kicks off one episode by having Peter run into a burning house to rescue one of the inhabitants, underlining his bravery credentials.
-   _Castle_: After a bomb goes off in Beckett's apartment, Castle rushes into the burning apartment to rescue her.

Then Beckett lampshades this trope by joking that Castle must be extremely keen to tell her about his heroism with regards to breaking down the door and rushing into the apartment.

-   _Chuck_: Chuck and Casey in "Chuck Versus The Frosted Tips", who run into a helicopter and its surrounds on fire to rescue Morgan and Gertrude Verbinski respectively.
-   Downplayed on _Downton Abbey_ when Thomas pulls Edith from the fire in her room — it's only a single room on fire rather than the whole building, but still a rather intimidating blaze.

-   _Emergency!_: Employed frequently, naturally enough for a show about firefighters.

Griffith, and is able to carry Mariah out of the house just before emergency workers arrive.

    Real Life 

-   While he was serving as mayor of Newark, NJ, current US senator and part time Batman Cory Booker came home to find an elderly neighbor's home to be on fire. Despite his personal security staff attempting to restrain him he rushed into the burning building and pulled the woman out, suffering second degree burns and smoke inhalation in the process.
-   Professional wrestler Bam Bam Bigelow rescued three young children from a burning house near his Florida home in 2000, receiving 2nd degree burns to 40% of his body in the process. In a grim irony, Bigelow was well known for the flames tattooed on his shaven head and his flame-patterned ring gear during his wrestling career.
-   In real life, there's a good chance that the rescue attempt will not turn out well for the rescuer. Not only do structural fires produce enough noxious smoke to quickly incapacitate a person who inhales just a small amount, but the heat itself can cause internal burns to the upper airway and even to the lungs. There's a reason that firefighters wear all of that safety equipment.
