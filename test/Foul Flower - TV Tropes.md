_"I shall enjoy plucking the petals from the wilting flower that is your life! \[...\] PlantMan! Treacherous Bloom!"_

Flowers are well-loved for their colorful petals and wonderful smells. Anthropomorphic smiling flowers are commonly seen in Sugar Bowl worlds. As with things such as circuses or Santa Claus, some creators like to subvert this positive portrayal and make it a downright evil character.

Foul Flowers are commonly portrayed as seemingly cute. Though their green, slender stems might look a little sinister, their smiling faces and vibrant petals may be deceptive, allowing them to commit all sorts of horrible acts. They may have cutesy names to go along with their innocent appearances. They are usually found in a Crapsaccharine World, and may instigate a Sugar Apocalypse if they destroy their happy land. Green Thumb is a common power used by them.

This negative portrayal may stem (no pun intended!) from the fact that a few flowers really do have some negative connotations. For example, _Rafflesia arnoldii_ are known for their corpse-like smell, roses (quite possibly the most famous flower) are covered in sharp thorns that make them unpleasant to handle, and Cherry Blossoms are used for connotations of death, due to not lasting very long, which reminds people of their own mortality. Additionally other species of flowers contain poison which can permanently put an end to a hiking trip, especially if they were mistaken for similar looking but harmless variants. To an individual suffering from medical conditions such as allergies or asthma, even the otherwise harmless spores emitted en-masse are the cause of much suffering;

Fictional plants especially seem to be designed to inflict maximum harm. In addition to the popular poison trait, the aforementioned spores may be deliberately weaponized in fiction to infect hosts. Less subtle plants may sport thorns or possessing razor sharp leaves or petals.

It could also be due to attracting various creatures for the sake of pollination, and many said creatures are notorious for their stingers.

Compare Alluring Flowers, Man-Eating Plant, When Trees Attack and Botanical Abomination, other villainous plants which are usually portrayed as more Obviously Evil than a Foul Flower. There may be some overlap, though.

-   _Five Nights at Freddy's World_: In the minigame "Chica's Magic Rainbow", there are tall sunflowers that shoot out their petals at Chica, creating a Bullet Hell as she must dodge each one, due to being a One-Hit-Point Wonder. The fact that the titular Rainbow is a condescending prick who likes insulting you at every chance she gets doesn't help much, either.
-   In _Grim Fandango_, the only way to kill those who have already died is called "sprouting", which involves shooting them with a special brand of bullet that causes flowers to rapidly grow from within their bodies.

-   _Ib_: One of the exhibits, "Stubborn Twins", is a pair of living rose sculptures found in the Orange Area of the Bonus Dungeon. If Ib tries to walk past the roses without putting them to sleep first, they will snatch her with their vines and munch on her until she loses all her rose petals, resulting in a Game Over.

    -   In _Klonoa Heroes_, Klonoa and his friends battle Joka—or so it seems. In the last phase of the battle, Joka turns out to be just a clone, who transforms into a floating, fireball-shooting beast called Flower Joka.
-   In _League of Legends_, the Mad Artist Khada Jhin uses this as a motif: his traps are designed like lotuses, he often refers to himself as a flower that blooms among carnage, the victims his Depleted Phlebotinum Shells hit end up with flowers sprouting out of them (in the cinematics, anyway), and a pair of his victims in the Marvel _Zed_ comics get their faces carved into flower shapes.

-   _Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth_: The fourth movie does this at its deepest level. While most of the dungeon is a disturbingly colorful Crapsaccharine World with everything smiling, the deepest level suddenly takes a turn and reveals flowers with blank, hollow eye sockets tearing blood and making a hollow grin. And there are much more disturbing implications behind this; The entire Labyrinth is actually Hikari's repressed memories taking the form of a biopic and a musical invoked by Doe, which means that the flowers are actually her mindset; That's how she sees her life as thanks to the emotional abuse chain that she experienced in her childhood along with her self-destructive paranoia that her father was against her.
-   _Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare 2_: The Zombie missions contain three flower bosses: the Sunflower Queen, who looks quite sinister with her pointy petals and glowing eyes, Marigold, which appears as a more minor enemy in other levels, but appears as a boss once to prevent the player from obtaining an important scroll, and the Final Boss, the Royal Hypno-Flower, which looks decidedly less threatening despite its size, but is nonetheless more dangerous than the other two.

-   _Machine Hunter_: The swamp level has acid-spitting flowers that attacks the moment you're in range.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   Although Piranha Plants are modeled after Venus flytraps, there are some, such as recurring boss Petey Piranha, that have a mane of petals, giving them a more flower-like appearance.
    -   _Paper Mario_:
        -   Crazee Dayzees are cute flower enemies that attack by singing and are also prone to running. There's also a Metal Slime variant known as Amazy Dayzees who not only have massive HP and give gobs of experience when defeated, but also have the highest single attack stat in the game (clocking in at 20 in a game where your maximum HP is unlikely to exceed 50).
        -   _Paper Mario 64_: Tolielip, an extremely minor character, is a resident of Flower Fields. He's actually quite knowledgeable about the secrets of Flower Fields, but as his name suggests, he tells the opposite clues.
        -   _Super Paper Mario_: The Floro Sapiens are a race of sapient walking flowers who brainwash and enslave the caveman-like Cragnons, Subverted when it's revealed that they only turned evil because the Cragnons polluted their water. Once the problem is solved, every Floro makes a Heel–Face Turn.
    -   _Mario Party 9_: In Piranha Patch, the goal is to collect flowers that grow from buds that appear around the stage, but these buds can just as easily grow into Piranha Plants that damage any players that touch them, so getting close to the buds before they open is a risk.
-   _Raging Blades_ have sentient flowers that attacks by shooting Bullet Seed projectiles on you in the swamp level, and later on you'll encounter a far more powerful variant in the underground caves that sics poisoned spikes. They can be cut down in just one hit, however.
-   _Sacred Odyssey: Rise of Ayden_: The Demon Tree mid-boss has a giant flower growing on top, and can fire poisonous spores as a ranged attack.
-   _Touhou Project_: Yuuka Kazami is a flower youkai... and one of the oldest and most powerful beings you can find in a setting that includes Physical Gods and Reality Warpers. In the past she expressed the sentiment that she just considers genocide to be a game, and the official Universe Compendium goes to great lengths to reinforce her position as The Dreaded, smacking her with a Threat Level of "Extremely High," which is typically reserved for Persons Of Mass Destruction, and a Human Friendship Level of "Worst," which is, as it implies, a Friendship Level that only Yuuka is bad enough to deserve. Fandom has nicknamed her the "Ultimate Sadistic Creature" and likes to show her inflicting Disproportionate Retribution on people who disturb her sunflower field.
-   _Ultimate Chicken Horse_ has a happy-looking potted flower in the "Sciencey Stuff" category. It punches players who pass near it, killing them instantly.
-   _Undertale_: Flowey the Flower is a malevolent Faux Affably Evil yellow flower who teaches the protagonist that "in this world, it's kill or be killed", and would have killed them if Toriel hadn't intervened. At the end, it is revealed that Flowey is actually the essence of Prince Asriel that was absorbed by a golden flower, and lacks empathy and love due to the loss of his SOUL. The neutral ending pushes the Nightmare Fuel up a notch by turning him into a Botanical Abomination.
-   Zig-Zagged with the Glass Flora boss type of _The Void Rains Upon Her Heart_. Most of them have creepy designs with eyes where the middle of the flowers should be, but they are Anti-Villains who desire friendship, and they attack because they're lashing out due to fear.
-   _Wario_:
    -   _Wario: Master of Disguise_ has a boss called Kabloom, a giant flower that steals a piece of the Dismantled MacGuffin. It starts out with an innocent face, complete with Cat Smile, but when it is damaged, it gains a much scarier face.
    -   Bloomsday from _Wario Land: Shake It!_ is a dark, menacing flower who serves as the fourth boss. It uses a variety of powers, from Blow You Away to Green Thumb, to try and kill Wario. It's also colored drab shades of gray and red, with bright Green Eyes.
-   _Wiz 'n' Liz_: Freaky Flower, the first boss, is an enormous flower with a disturbingly realistic human face. It bounces around and tries to crush the player.
-   _Yoshi's Island_: Zigzagged. On one hand, there are some helpful flowers, such as the 5 flowers in each level that Yoshi can collect for bonus points. On the other hand, there are some enemies based on flowers, such as Dizzy Dandies, which pretend to be collectable flowers, then drop to the ground and start rolling at Yoshi when he gets close.

    Web Comics

-   _Bob the Angry Flower_: Bob, an anthropomorphic sunflower, is a Mad Scientist and a Heroic Comedic Sociopath.
-   _Wonderlab_ has the Staining Rose, a deceptively ordinary rose that the Department Heads are terrified of. Their fear is not unfounded, as anyone who is unfit to work on the Staining Rose will be afflicted with a contagious disease that causes people to cough up rose petals until they die. The fates of people who _are_ fit to work on it aren't pretty either — It is heavily implied that when a worker is able to "resonate" with the Staining Rose, they are chosen by it as a Human Sacrifice.

-   In the web cartoon Bino the Elephant, while exploring Hell, Bino comes across a flower with a face who insists that he pees on her. He refuses, but the doctor on the other side of the comunicator tells him to do it since this is a flower from hell and will probablly be key to open the Chamber of Misery. We thankfully don't see the operation, but we do get to hear from the Doctor's communicator that the flower started crawling inside Bino's urethra... and _singing_. It's not clear if the flower is evil or just weird, though.
-   In _Battle for Dream Island_, Flower was a far-from-charming charming century flower, which resulted in her being the first and last contestant eliminated. She has softened up as of BFB, however.

    Western Animation  

-   The flowers in _Alice in Wonderland_ seem at first like an Averted Trope since they behave rather nicely towards Alice... until they discover she isn't a flower and deduce that, if she's not a flower, she must be a weed. Thus, they shun her, humiliate her and kick her away while laughing, driving her almost to tears.
-   In _The Amazing World of Gumball_, Leslie is a literal living potted plant (which is not the strangest thing in this world). The trope is zigzagged and mostly Depending on the Writer: sometimes he's a straight up Nice Guy, sometimes envious and manipulating (like in "The Triangle" in which he tries to sabotage Darwin's performance), and other times it is subverted (like in "The Flower" which is about Gumball being jealous at him for stealing his girlfriend Penny, not knowing that they actually are cousins).
-   _Dragons: Riders of Berk_: The admittedly beautiful flower blue oleander is lethal to dragons.

-   _My Little Pony_:
    -   _My Little Pony 'n Friends_: "Fugitive Flowers" has the Flories, who start out as cute, pretty talking flowers who beg the protagonists for help... and then reveal themselves to be the true villains of the episode, seeking to drain the ground of life to turn themselves into towering plant monsters, killing everything growing in the earth they drain as they do so.
    -   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
        -   Poison joke, a type of blue flowers found growing in the Everfree Forest, is not evil — it's no more animated than any real flower — but is nonetheless quite dangerous. Anyone who touches it directly will be subject to a random magical transformation that will rob them of the ability to do something they value — essentially a cruel magical joke. The magic prodigy Twilight Sparkle, for instance, loses her ability to perform magic; the speedy athlete Rainbow Dash finds her wings turned backwards, robbing her of the ability to fly straight or reliably; and the talkative Pinkie Pie ends up with a tongue so swollen that she is unable to keep it in her mouth and completely unable to speak.

While the other five ponies' dreams involve cakes, dresses, books, apples, and giant bunnies, local Action Girl Rainbow Dash dreams of fighting changelings. When the Tantabus invades her dream, it changes it into a deliberately exaggerated Sugar Bowl parody filled with harmless singing flowers. For Rainbow, who enjoys action and adventure and has consistently disliked anything she perceives as "girly" or "frou-frou", this is utterly unbearable.
            
            We are such happy flowers  
            We will now sing for hours and hours,  
            Aren't we all unbearably cute?

After Zecora gets a faceful of pollen from one of these and starts developing similar dots, they discover that these flowers reproduce by spreading a disease called swamp fever through their pollen, which causes its victims to gradually and irreversibly transform into another tree of the kind that bears their flowers.
-   _Steven Universe_: The Slinker is a corrupted Gem that has the appearance of an eerily beautiful dark blue flower with long tendrils.
