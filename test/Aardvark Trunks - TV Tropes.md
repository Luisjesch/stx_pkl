Anteaters and aardvarks have become somewhat common in fiction lately, though other ant-eating mammals such as echidnas and pangolins are more rarely seen. When they are seen, due to their large, vacuum-shaped snouts resembling the trunk of an elephant, their snouts are often much more flexible than realistically possible. Real snouts are bony, unlike the boneless, muscle-filled trunk of an elephant, and thus cannot be flexed around like an elephant's trunk.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

This depiction comes in different styles for the different kinds of ant-eating mammals:

-   Anteaters are sometimes portrayed as having their mouths at the base of the snout rather than at the tip, with the snout acting as a nose. This is usually to give the animal more facial expressions. Alternatively, even if the mouth is at the tip of the snout, it is still much more expressible than it should be.
-   Aardvarks are usually a victim to the Informed Species trope, often resembling anteaters more than aardvarks. They are often depicted as having snouts pointing down like anteaters, rather than straight out with pig-like noses at the tip.
-   Echidnas, sometimes called "spiny anteaters", can have either long, curved beaks or short, straight ones, depending on the subspecies. Like anteaters, they may be depicted as having mouths at the base of their beaks rather than the tip.
-   Pangolins, sometimes called "scaly anteaters", have similar mouths to anteaters (albeit a bit shorter) and therefore tend to suffer the same treatment as the other ant-eating mammals.

It should be mentioned that occasionally, they are erroneously shown sucking up ants rather than slurping them. This is also false, as sucking ants from an anthill would mean sucking the dirt too, which real ant-eating mammals avoid. And while many of these animals lack teeth in real life <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , they are often given teeth in fiction to make them even more expressive.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Princess Tutu_: Anteaterina's snout is rather expressive, changing position from being straight from her face to rather droopy.

    Comic Books 

-   _Boner's Ark_: Arnie has a mouth behind his pig-like nose.
-   _Cerebus the Aardvark_: When the comic started, Cerebus had a long snout with a somewhat pig-like nose that was the same width as his snout. As the comic progressed and Sim's art improved, his snout shortened and the nose broadened, becoming more round and completely obscuring his snout if seen from the front. He also has two mouths, one on each side of his head just behind his snout. Cirin and Suenteus Po, the two other aardvarks that appear in the story, have similar mouth/snout arrangements but their snouts are more tapered and their noses aren't as wide as Cerebus' is.

    Comic Strips 

-   Anteaters in _B.C._ appear to have _two_ mouths, with one realistically at the tip of the snout (where the tongue is shot from) and another at the base.

    Film — Animated 

-   _Ice Age_: There is a creature that is identified as an aardvark, but though it has the ears of an aardvark, it has the bushy tail and coloration of a giant anteater, and its snout is weirdly elongated to be reminiscent of an anteater (not an aardvark), but that animal would have a tiny mouth at the tip of its snout, whereas the cartoon critter has its mouth at the base.
-   _Over the Moon_: Gobi the pangolin looks more like a bear at first glance due to how wide his nose and mouth are drawn.
-   Charlie the Anteater in _Rio 2_ seems to have more of a flexible _tongue_. He is correctly portrayed as having a long tongue just like real anteaters. However, there is still some Artistic License – Biology involved, as he is portrayed as having an Overly-Long Tongue that is sometimes shown stretching to his _feet_. He also suffers a lot of Tongue Trauma throughout the movie by Nigel.
-   The 2016 Belgium film _Robinson Crusoe_ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  features both a pangolin (named Pango) and an echidna (named Epi). For the most part, Pango's design is fairly accurate, but Epi's snout looks more like a nose with a mouth underneath.

    Literature 

-   In the first _Arthur_ book, Arthur the aardvark had a long nose but he looked more like a brown tapir (or a giant anteater, without the stripes or the plumes of hair on the tail) than an aardvark, with a medium-sized pig-like snout pointing downward. In the second book, he had a long face with his mouth at the end of it (but not an accurate snout). In following books, his nose was gradually shortened until in his later design (and in the animated series) Arthur and his family had absolutely no snouts at all, making them not even look like aardvarks. Awkwardly, said first book was entitled _Arthur's Nose_, in which Arthur faces bullying for his long nose and learns to accept himself as he is, making for a rather Broken Aesop.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _It's a Big Big World_: Bob is a tamandua (an arboreal species of anteater) whose mouth is at the base of his snout.

    Toys 

-   _Star Monsters_: Hanako has a long snout due to an anteater hitting the star it formed from with its snout.

    Video Games 

-   _Animal Crossing_: The snouts of all anteater villagers wiggle when they talk.
-   _Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course_: A massive anteater is one of the opponents faced in the level "Bootlegger Boogie". His mouth is placed at the base of the snout rather than at the tip, making the snout a trunk of sorts. Despite this, the tip of the snout still has a tongue come out of it, making him essentially have _two mouths_. As if that wasn't weird enough, in the anteater's game over quote, he still refers to his trunk as a "nose." This is also true of the villainous anteater in "Ants in the Plants" (see the Western Animation section), which the anteater's design seems to have been based on.
-   _Rampage: Total Destruction_: Icky is a giant echidna. However, his snout looks more like a pig's than an echidna's.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_: Knuckles the echidna appears to be a strange inversion of this trope. Rather than having the beak his species is known for, he instead has a pointed snout with a black nose and a mouth with sharp teeth underneath, resembling a dog more than an echidna.

    Web Animation 

-   _Happy Tree Friends_: Sniffles the anteater has a very expressive mouth at the tip of his trunk. Additionally, his trunk was originally very long and droopy but later shortened, though is still somewhat flexible. A few episodes have even shown that his trunk is hollow and he has another pair of jaws at the base of his skull, pushing this trope even further.

    Web Original 

-   In _Serina_ the noot alludes to this trope, being an anteater-like animal which a movable, trunk-like snout. This is because it is actually a member of a highly aberrant canary lineage that developed facial tentacles, so the snout is pretty much all muscle.

    Western Animation 

-   _Adventure Time_: The episode "Beyond The Grotto" introduces the alternate selves of several characters. The alternate of Tree Trunks the elephant? Bush Roots the anteater, who looks pretty much like an elephant with smaller ears and a bushy tail.
-   _Almost Naked Animals_: Anteater has his mouth at the base of his snout rather than the tip. His snout, however, is usually straight, though he sometimes uses it like a trunk.
-   _The Ant and the Aardvark_: The titular Aardvark looks more like an anteater with his mouth at the end of his snout, and even then, it's super flexible and he usually tries to eat Ant by sucking him rather than slurping him up. More prominent in _Pink Panther and Pals_, where the Aardvark's snout is curved upwards like an elephant trunk.
-   _Around the World with Willy Fog_ zig-zags this trope. The conductor on the train which takes the travellers on the first leg of their journey across India is an anteater whose snout is drawn fairly realistically, with a small mouth at the tip. However, while he's talking, both the tip and the base of his snout move, making it look as though he has two mouths, one at either end of his snout.
-   _Bubble Guppies_: The anteater from the episode "Bring on the Bugs" has his mouth in the correct place, but also displays a flexible snout.
-   _The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!_: One episode has a giant anteater with his mouth at the base of his snout.
-   _Color Classics_: The anteater in "Ants in the Plants" has a trunk that looks and functions very much like an elephant's, and it is even able to stretch and bend through the ant tunnels.
-   _Doki_: Oto is a lesser anteater with the accurate body markings of one, although he has yellow fur and, of course, a mouth at the base of his snout.
-   A Take That! variant. In the _Family Guy_ episode "Peterotica", Renée Zellweger's face is drawn like an anteater's snout and she's seen sucking down ants.
-   _George of the Jungle (2007)_: In the episode "L'il Orphan Anteater'', George adopts a baby anteater with an expressive trunk that Shep the elephant grows jealous over.
-   _Harvey Beaks_: The episode "The Almighty Foo" introduces Easy, an anteater exterminator with his mouth at the base of his snout.
-   _Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness_: Sanzu, a villainous pangolin who appears in "Po Picks a Pocket", has a snout tipped with a bulbous dark nose and his mouth at the base, making him resemble a dog.
-   Cyril and Cedric Sneer, and Sophia Tutu in _The Raccoons_ are pink aardvarks whose trunks act like noses, with their mouths at the base of their trunks.
-   _Sonic Boom_: Similar to Knuckles, Diane Aardvark is also drawn with a dog's snout rather than that of her own species.
-   _South Park: The Pandemic Special_: The pangolin has a short, wide snout, rather than a slightly longer, skinnier snout.
-   _Spartakus and the Sun Beneath the Sea_: Bic and Bac, both pangolins, have mouths underneath their snouts that look like noses. They also have no scales or claws, unlike real-life pangolins.
-   The anteater from the _Timon & Pumbaa_ episode "Paraguay Parable" was prone to this, having a flexible trunk with his lips at the end.
-   An inverted example from the _Tiny Toon Adventures_ episode "Who Bopped Bugs Bunny?". Sappy Stanley, an elephant, has his mouth drawn at the tip of his trunk rather than the base, making him resemble an aardvark or anteater.
    -   A Perfecto Prep elephant from the episode "The ACME Bowl" also has his mouth at the tip of his trunk.
-   _The Tom and Jerry Show (1975)_: In the episode "Termites Plus Two", the titular duo brings in an anteater as one of the ways to dispose of a termite colony. As the anteater sucks up the insects, its snout becomes bloated. Its mouth also briefly moves to the underside of its snout when Tom helps it hold in a sneeze, caused by a feather that the termites were carrying in order to escape.
-   _Trunk Train_ has Duda, who is yet another anteater with a misplaced mouth.
-   _Yin Yang Yo!_: The Stink Aardvarks are _very_ elephant-like in appearance, thanks to their flexible trunks.
