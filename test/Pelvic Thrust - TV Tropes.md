_With your hand on your hips, you bring your knees in tight.  
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insa-a-a-a-a-ane.  
Let's do the Time Warp again!_

Stock Pose where a character thrusts his or her pelvis outward. It is like the Pelvis Pose, but its implications tend toward the lewd or Jerkass side of the spectrum.

A character who does pelvis thrusts is usually crass or forward, and the motion tends to offend other characters, commonly of the female persuasion.

The pelvis thrust can manifest in a variety of ways. The character can do a single thrust for emphasis; several slow thrusts in a flirtatious or come-hither manner; or a series of pelvis thrusts or circular revolutions as a form of mockery, celebration, or taunting.

The pelvic thrust is also a dance move popularized by the likes of Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson. Some musicians or characters can use this dance to entice onlookers successfully; it may be accompanied by a hand over the crotch. Many musicians do pelvic thrusts to simulate sexual intercourse while performing a song that's about Intercourse with You. However, outside of music, pelvic thrusts will typically be off-putting.
