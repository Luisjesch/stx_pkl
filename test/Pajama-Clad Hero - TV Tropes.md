There's nothing more inconvenient than a Call to Adventure in the middle of the night.

_"Not bad for a man in his jimjams! Very Arthur Dent. Now_ there's _a nice man."_

If there's one thing worse than the advancing hordes of evil turning up on your doorstep and forcing you onto a long quest to save the world, it's when it happens before you've even had your coffee. You finally got a chance to catch some sleep, and got rudely awoken by The Call in the middle of the night, telling you to rush out of the house without so much as a chance to get dressed. Or even put on your shoes (though maybe you prefer it).

Some heroes spend virtually their _entire adventure_ wearing nothing but their jimmy-jams. On the plus side, they're comfy and warm, and a stylish dressing-gown can lend a touch of the Badass Longcoat. But you do tend to look a tad ridiculous, and a dressing-gown over a long nightshirt may be confused with Sword and Sandal wear, the Middle Eastern traditional costume descended from it, or wizard robes.

The implications of this may vary. In some cases it may simply mean that the hero was caught off guard and didn't have time to get properly dressed. In others, it may be used as a not-so-subtle indication that none of what's happening is real.

## Always pajama-clad

    Anime & Manga 

-   Technically, Near from _Death Note_ is always in pajamas.
-   Averted in _The Adventures of Peter Pan_. The Darling siblings are almost always depicted as this, but in this particular adaptation they manage to get their normal clothes before being whisked away by Peter.
-   _Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle_: Since most every chapter either ends with her falling asleep or starts with her waking up, the Princess spends most of her time in her (admittedly extra-fancy) pajamas.
-   _Cardcaptor Sakura_ has the titular Sakura get thrown into action while still in her pajamas on quite a few occasions.

    Comic Books 

-   _Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman_, who is decidedly Not a Morning Person, decides one Monday morning that he simply doesn't care, and is going to go to work in his pajamas. This also turns out to be the morning when he meets future love interest Lena.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Little Nemo_ is the most iconic Pajama-Clad Hero.
-   Mickey "The Yellow Kid" Dugan at first wore a blue nightgown handed down from an older sister until he switched to his trademark yellow nightshirt.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Coraline_: In The Film of the Book, Coraline Jones wears pajamas for maybe over half the film.
-   _How to Catch a Cold_: The protagonist spends the entire short in his pyjamas, because he's just woken up and has to stay in bed from his cold.
-   Boo from _Monsters, Inc._ appears to be wearing a pink nightshirt, lavender stockings, and white socks throught the entire film (except when she is wearing a makeshift costume Sulley and Mike made to hide her identity).
-   Wendy, Michael and John in Disney's _Peter Pan_ are in their pajamas for the entire film.
-   The kids in _The Polar Express_, both the original book and the animated film, are all dressed in pajamas and nightgowns, since they were all summoned from their beds for the train ride.
-   In the second half of _Rise of the Guardians_, the kids are outside in winter in their pajamas. Jamie and Sophie are noticeably barefoot, Jamie was even standing on a frozen lake. Considering they are with _Jack Frost_ perhaps he did something to make sure they'd be okay.
-   Edmund from _Rock-A-Doodle_, but only when he's a live-action human. He wears doll clothes after being turned into a cartoon cat by the evil owl.
-   The titular character in the BBC computer-animated movie _The Tale of Jack Frost_ based on the children's book of the same name. He wears only his pajama pants, and is shirtless and barefoot in the snow.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Arthur Dent in The Film of the Book of _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005)_.
-   _MirrorMask_: Helena spends well over half her adventure in her pajamas and bunny slippers.
-   L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries spends the entirety of _Rear Window_ in a pair of blue pajamas.

    Literature 

-   In the _Altraterra_ series by Yvonne Pioch, Anne spends the first quarter of the book (the ride to Academy) only in her nightshirt as she had to flee with others in haste. Given that she has to ride in it for days without change or a chance to wash it, it created a huge discomfort to her, especially when she arrived to the academy. Imagine being led before the ruling body (which resides in academy) wearing nothing but a ragged, partially ripped, smelly nightshirt...
-   Scrooge in _A Christmas Carol_ is haunted by the spirits during the night before Christmas, so he travels through time wearing his dressing gown.
-   In J. K. Rowling's _The Christmas Pig,_ the title character actually suggests that Jack change into normal clothes before starting their adventure, but he declines. He's also barefoot, in part because his slippers had come to life. In the Land of the Lost he claims to be an action figure named Pajama Boy, "with the power of sleep and dreams." He has his own cartoon.
-   Sarah from _Greystone Valley_ is in tattered blue pajamas up until the very final act.
-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Trilogy_: Arthur Dent hitchhikes the galaxy in his pajamas and bathrobe. He finally gets a change of clothes in _So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish_. In the radio series, the first book and _The Restaurant at the End of the Universe_, Douglas Adams wasn't entirely clear what Arthur was wearing; he wrote a scene for the TV series in which the _Heart of Gold_ provides him with new clothes, but this was vetoed by the director, on the grounds that it was funnier for him to be in his pajamas. Since Adams then wrote Arthur as still in his (increasingly tattered) dressing gown in _Life, the Universe and Everything_, he presumably agreed.
-   Bilbo, from _The Hobbit_ by J. R. R. Tolkien, forgets his handkerchief and money in addition to starting his adventure in his dressing-gown. Subverted when Dwalin lets Bilbo use his hood and cloak.
-   In the _Mabel Jones_ series, the heroine, Mabel, never takes off her pyjamas while in the Noo World, despite wearing the pyjamas for weeks without changing them. This is taken to ridiculous levels during the only time she DID take them off - dressing a skeleton in her pyjamas as a distraction- only to immediately change back into her pyjamas when the danger was over despite them just being on a, well, skeleton. She must really like wearing her pyjamas.
-   Delphie in the first book of the _Magic Ballerina_ series, "Delphie and the Magic Ballet Shoes", spends her first trip to Enchantia wearing her pajamas.
-   Georgina in _The Magic Light_ by Gabrielle Alioth. She is transferred onto a magic island from her bedroom, pajama-clad and barefoot. At some point she lampshades this by saying that if she knew she would go on an adventure, she would be dressed more appropriately.
-   The eponymous character of Jodi Lynn Anderson's _May Bird_ series spends the entire 3rd book in pajamas and a bathing suit.
-   The Darling children in _Peter Pan_ are possibly the Trope Codifiers. However, given that they spent several days if not weeks in Neverland, it's left vague as to whether or not they did continue wearing their pajamas. Some illustrations subvert the trope by having Wendy make new clothes made from the forests of Neverland for herself and her siblings to wear, only to return back into their pajamas when they finally return home to London.
-   In 'Tom's Midnight Garden' by Philippa Pearce, Tom spends most of his visits to the garden in pajamas, and one slipper (he used the other slipper to prop open a door, before travelling to the garden).
-   The titular realm in _Unimaa_ is a Dream Land, so it makes sense that every child there would be in pajamas. In fact, for the members of the secret society within, this is one of the things that makes them realize the place was turned into a Lotus-Eater Machine after having been there for _years_ without waking up or aging at all, because their leader tricked them into giving her their souls.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Bananas in Pyjamas_: The bananas always wear their pajamas, hence their name. As they themselves admit, this is entirely by choice, since they love wearing their pajamas which they say are really comfortable. The only time they had to take them off was because they needed to wash the pajamas and they wasted no time putting their pajamas back on the first chance they got.
-   _The Pajanimals_ is a children's series about four anthropomorphic animals who sing songs related to getting ready to bed in the original shorts and in the full version series travel off to magical lands at nighttime to deal with various issues. As the name implies, they are almost always show in their pajamas, though they are very rarely depicted with them off for bathtime and it's implied that they still do stuff like go to school and don't wear them when they do that; we just don't ever see it.

    Theatre 

-   Clara/Marie from _The Nutcracker_ spends most of the show in her nightie, since the whole thing is a dream sequence.
-   The Darling children in _Peter Pan_ are almost always shown in their pajamas. However, some renditions of the play would have them swap their pajamas for woodland-inspired green clothes similar to Peter Pan himself once they settled in Neverland.

    Video Games 

-   In _Among the Sleep_, you play as a two-year-old boy in his pajamas exploring the house at night, staying with your Teddy, and trying to make sense of the perceived "monsters" you encounter.

-   As a consequence of being awoken in the middle of the night, the titular protagonist of _Lumen_ adventures around in her pajamas. One benefit of this is that it's decorated with blueish stars that become red when a hostile entity is nearby.
-   _Pajama Sam_, the eponymous hero of the children's adventure game series, is never seen outside his footie pajamas. The premise of the game is that Sam deals with things that frighten him after he goes to bed, so his "Pajama Sam" superhero persona makes sense. Of course, his hero persona is based on his in-universe favorite comic, Pajama Man, who also embodies this trope.
-   Ruff and Tumble, the male and female protagonists in the Playstation game _40 Winks_ wear blue and pink pajamas throughout the duration of their adventure, respectively.

-   You in _Fable III_, if you decide saving the world should be done in your sleeping clothes.
-   _Super Mario Galaxy_: Rosalina's dress actually resembles a nightgown, which appropriately fits the fact that she lives far out in space, where it is constantly night out (unless she is orbiting a Sun).
-   Vincent from _Catherine_ spends most of the action sequences wearing polka-dot boxers. Not that the ladies are complaining.
-   Phillip of _Space Funeral_ is always dressed in his yellow and black striped pajamas.

-   The entire premise of _Knock-Knock_ features the Lodger wandering around his house in the early hours of the day wearing his dressing gown and slippers while avoiding ghosts.
-   _The Sandman (2014)_: Since Sophie was just trying to get some rest before the whole mess unfolded, she sets off to find out what happened while dressed in her pink sleepwear.
-   _Neverending Nightmares_: Thomas, the player character, explores his dreams wearing his pajamas. This actually factors into gameplay, as he doesn't have space to put an inventory, and, being a horror game, the fact that he isn't wearing shoes comes back to bite him more than once.
-   Averted in _Yume Nikki_: despite the entire game taking place in Madotsuki's bedroom and dreams, she wears a shirt and skirt instead.
-   _Nightmare Ned_ spends the duration of his adventure through the Nightmare World in his pajamas.
-   Plutia from _Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory_ onwards. Probably helps, since she's known to be quite the Sleepyhead.
-   Ellie in _Monster Tale_ is technically in her nightgown in the game, though it _does_ resemble a regular if very plain short dress. However, the ending cinematic makes it clear that it's not her regular clothes.

    -   In the first game, you play as Ruby in her pajamas who goes looking for her parents at night, all while trying to evade her demonic stuffed rabbit.

-   _Milon's Secret Castle_: Milon is either wearing pajamas or overalls. The hat he's wearing looks like a night cap, so it's hard to tell.
-   The player protagonist in _Sacra Terra Angelic Night_ wanders around a dilapidated mental hospital in nothing but a hospital gown. He doesn't even wear shoes despite having to deal with brambles, rotten wood and _broken glass._
-   In _Nekomew's Potty Trouble_ and _Nekomew's Nightmares_, you play as the titular character himself; a 4-year-old kitten who is dressed in a dark blue nightcap and nightshirt and trying to face off against the many monsters he encounters along the way.
-   _Shantae: Half-Genie Hero_: The update-added Jammies Mode has Shantae go through levels in her jammies.

    Webcomics 

-   Sul spends the entirity of _Kiss Wood_ in his pajamas, though he does find a coat early on (he loses it eventually).
-   Hero in _The Property of Hate_ spends her adventure in her yellow pajamas and wellies. She does initially have a coat but then ends up discarding it after an incident involving doubts, causing her coat to be somewhat... gelatinous.

-   Alvin, Simon, and Theodore of _Alvin and the Chipmunks_ wear what are essentially color-coded nightshirts most of the time. Though they could just be large sweaters. They change into _different_ pajama separates for bed.
-   Professor Farnsworth from _Futurama_ is always in his pajamas. However, this includes a lab coat, so maybe it's better to say he sleeps fully dressed. His catchphrase was going to be "Well I am already in my pajamas!" but was quickly dropped.
-   _PJ Masks_: The title superheroes' costumes are made from their pajamas, hence why they can only transform at night and when wearing their pajamas. The fact that their costumes are essentially their pajamas has been mockingly lampshaded a few times by the various villains.

    Real Life 

-   Hugh Hefner made most of his public appearances in his iconic pajamas and a smoking jacket.

-   In episode 52 of _Sonic X_, Tails gets woken up in the middle of the night by Eggman. He hops in the Tornado in his pajamas, though they're only there for a scene or two. Which is odd, because he usually doesn't wear clothes of any kind, not counting shoes and gloves.
-   An odd example, but an early episode of _HeartCatch Pretty Cure!_ had Tsubomi, who had stayed home ill after learning the cute Student Council President was actually a girl, race to save her in her pajamas. After saving the day, she doesn't realize she was still in these clothes until said President questions why she was in school in her pajamas.

To help him, she rips off part of her pajama shirt and ties it around his arm.
-   _Digimon Adventure_:
    -   On their first encounter with Devimon, the kids get ambushed while in bed at an abandoned, but fully equipped inn after a nice bath and dinner.

    Fan Works 

-   Though not exactly a hero, in the _Death Note_ fic _Welcome To The Family_ when Near and Matt barge into his room in the middle of the night, they find Light Yagami with messy hair and wearing fuzzy, black and white skull and cross bone pajamas, though Light claims it's not his usual choice in pajamas either but that his jailers have a bad sense of humor. Ultimately subverted since Light insists on getting dressed before doing anything though Near (who is a straight example of this trope) can't imagine _why_ and uses his wanting to get dressed first like a normal person as yet another excuse to accuse him again of being Kira.
-   In A.A. Pessimal's _Discworld_/_The Big Bang Theory_ crossover _The Many Worlds Interpretation_, Discworld Assassin Johanna Smith-Rhodes, responding quickly to an emergency need to guard Sheldon Cooper against a peril they have brought from the Disc with them, reasons that good weapons are more vital in a fight than getting dressed.

-   Ann Darrow in _King Kong (2005)_ spends most of her scenes at Skull Island in her nightgown and a robe as she was kidnapped by the Skull Island tribe as she prepared to sleep. She was also barefoot through it all.
-   The second time Stanley Ipkiss dons _The Mask_, he does so while wearing his pajamas. This leads to the police suspecting him of being involved with a bank heist committed by his alter-ego, after part of The Mask's zoot suit is shot off and morphs back into a scrap of Stanley's nautical-themed jammies for the cops to find.
    
    **Stanley:** "That's... impossible!"  
    **Det. Kellaway:** "Those _pajamas_ are impossible, Ipkiss. This actually happened!"
    

    Literature

-   James Herriot from the _All Creatures Great And Small_ books was a country vet. This meant that he (as well as Seigfried and Tristan) spent a few stories in his pajamas being called out for a late night calving.

-   In the _Bolo_ short story _The Murphosensor Bomb_, the focus character and her commanding officer were so focused on tracking down and eliminating the virus that had infected Bolos across the sector that neither of them paid any attention to 1: Said focus character had gone straight from her bed to her workstation to work on this problem, and 2: She slept in the nude. Shortly after the problem was solved, she tracked down a bathrobe.

    -   The Twelfth Doctor walks around in London wearing a Victorian nightshirt for a portion of "Deep Breath".

-   In _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, Toph Bei Fong spends most of her debut episode in her night clothes, and gets kidnapped before beating up several grown men while so dressed. She's a 12-year-old girl.
-   In one episode of _Codename: Kids Next Door_, Numbuh Three's Rainbow Monkey toys mysteriously went missing in the night, so the team decided on the spot to search for them, not stopping to change out of their pajamas.
-   The _DuckTales (2017)_ episode "The Split Sword of Swanstantine!" has Lena and Violet in their pajamas the whole episode due to being inadvertently dragged along for an adventure while on a sleep-over.
-   In _The Little Rascals_ episode "The Zero Hero", Alfalfa as Alpha-Man wears his pajamas in public, along with a towel cape and a mask which does not hide his eyes.
-   In _American Dragon: Jake Long_ episode "Adventures in Troll-Sitting", Jake wears his pajamas from morning to evening as he was trying to hide the troll and get rid of the living troll furballs. He's also barefoot.
-   In _Steven Universe_, a few episodes have Steven almost entirely dressed in his pajamas. While one episode is about a slumber party which justifies his clothing, another time he decides to not fall asleep for two nights, yet still dresses into his pajamas, ending with him following a weird creature and almost freezing to death in the warp.
-   On _Llama Llama_, the story "Lucky Pajamas" is specifically about him being in his pajamas all day because he believes them to have become lucky after Mama Llama sewed them. The original book _Llama Llama Red Pajama_, of course, has Llama Llama in his pajamas and is set at bedtime. The story was adapted for the animated series as well, but he's only clad towards the end of the story because most of it is actually set during daytime.
-   In _Chaotic_, the main character Tom had his first battle in Perim in his pajamas. His opponent remarked that being in pajamas is a typical sign of a newcomer.
-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_: In the episode "Crystal Clear", Star is dragged off by Rhombulus to his lair in the middle of the night while in her nightgown. She also loses her socks at one point.
    -   In "Total Eclipsa the Moon", Eclipsa doesn't bother to get dressed before going to the Royal Archives with Moon to find out what happened to her half-monster daughter, Meteora.
-   _Code Lyoko_: Some of XANA's attack happens at night, and the heroes don't always have the time to get dressed before dealing with the emergency. Notably in the episode "Is Anybody Out There?", where they have to trek to the factory in their nighties. It doesn't matter so much once they reach the scanners, though, since their Lyoko avatars are always fully equipped.
-   _Miraculous Ladybug_: In "Gorizilla", Marinette spends so much time swooning over Adrien's new ad that she misses her appointment with Alya and her other friends to hang out at the pool. She runs out, forgetting her new swimsuit and the fact that she's still in her pajamas. Before she can go back to change, she runs into Adrien who is currently on the run from his fans and his bodyguard, having snuck out to see an old movie which his Missing Mom starred in. The end result is that she spends most of the day with him, still in her pajamas. She is understandably embarassed once this sinks in at the end of the episode.
-   _Amphibia_: The episode "The Sleepover to End All Sleepovers" has Anne, Marcy and Sprig in their pajamas throughout the whole episode. The only exception is Polly, since she doesn't wear clothes.
-   _Gravity Falls_: Dipper and Mabel spend the entirely of the first Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained short (Candy Monster) in their sleeping outfits.
-   _Kaijudo_: In the episode "Night Moves", Allie hosts a Slumber Party with Portia, Maribel and Lucy, hoping that they former two can get along with the latter. Unfortunately, things go from bad to worse when they are attacked by Gorgeon, Shadow of Gluttony, and the girls are forced to escape it while still in their pajamas and barefoot. Lucy is the only one in her regular clothes, although she does lose her shoes later.
-   On _Blue's Clues & You!_, both host Josh and Blue are in their pajamas throughout "Pajama Party with Blue", naturally.
-   _South Park_: At the beginning of "A Very Crappy Christmas", Kyle is worried for Mr. Hankey because the latter didn't show up at his house. The former calls his friends and they all go into the sewers to look for Mr. Hankey, their coats and jackets thrown haphazardly over pajamas. Noticeably, Kenny is wearing his trademark face-covering parka—but no trousers. Wading through rivers of hip-deep rancid feces, no less.
-   _The Owl House_: In the episode "Hunting Palismen", Luz spends the majority of the episode in her new pajamas. She does wear her Hexside uniform in a few scenes, though.
-   In _The Amazing World of Gumball_, there are two episodes where Gumball and Darwin spend the entirety of the runtime in their sleepwear. "The Castle" has the two realize that it's Saturday and that Richard is in charge of the house, where there are no rules and are allowed to spend the day in their pajamas along with their little sister Anais. "The Vegging" has Gumball and Darwin spend an entire day doing nothing but slacking off on the couch in their pajamas. A lot of things happen around them, but they were too lazy to simply care or notice.
-   The _Betty Boop_ short "Red Hot Mamma" has Betty wandering through hell in her night gown.
