Sebastian finally gets to see Eric 'Kiss The Girl'.

_"Smile when you're happy, cry when you're sad... and do both when you're happier than you've ever been."_

To many, tears are an expression of sadness or weakness. Sometimes it can even indicate ultimate Badassery, since only the hardest badasses can get away with shedding them. In any case, tears are always connected to emotions too strong to contain and are to be used sparingly and wisely, else the character passes off as wangsty or just plain weak, even if they're female.

Still, there is one instance when tears are never looked down upon and accepted from _anyone_: joy.

Crying for joy is the uppermost expression of happiness and ecstasy, indicating things like that the villain has at last received comeuppance, The Quest is finally over, the Starcrossed Lovers are reunited for good...

Often witnessed in Real Life during similar moments, making this a Truth in Television.

Not to be confused with the Tearful Smile which meaning is more ambiguous. Sometimes overlaps with Tender Tears.

Compare Manly Tears, Tears of Awe, and Tears of Remorse.
