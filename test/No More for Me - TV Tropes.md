_"I gotta lay off the pills, I'm seein' shit."_

Some startling, extraordinary event occurs, and a bewildered spectator (archetypally, a lone tramp with a bottle) decides that some consumable they're working on is causing hallucinations, and, after taking a long look at it, promptly puts the drink down, throws it away or pours it out on the ground. They might also take a vow of sobriety out loud (often with one hand raised), or write down a pledge to stop drinking or drugging.

If the person realizes their eyes and/or mind are not playing tricks on them, they may either recant or find a loophole in their decision.

Where this trope originated isn't clear. "Taking the pledge" to stop drinking alcoholic beverages certainly dates back to the Temperance movement of the late 1800s, and it likely became a joke as a put-down to that movement. However, it's less clear why the joke involves having _hallucinations_ be the trigger for this action. It may be a throwback to the time of Prohibition, when poorly-brewed alcoholic drinks often contained methanol, which can cause brain damage and blindness. Or to the Great Depression, when alcoholic bums often resorted to drinking Sterno which also contains methanol. It might also come from the (incorrect) idea that the disorder called "delirium tremens," which often includes hallucinations, is a symptom of drinking too much. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

As one of those "old-fashioned" comedy gags, it's rarely played straight nowadays, largely being replaced by Stoners Are Funny. Contrast I Need a Freaking Drink (where the situation will make someone on screen turn to drinking). A Sister Trope to Mistaken for Bad Vision, when that trope occurs without alcohol.

Compare with Acid Reflux Nightmare, where someone swears off consumption of something after it gives them bad dreams. Also compare with Bizarre Dream Rationalization, when a character brushes off the extraordinary things they're seeing as being part of a dream.

    Films — Animation 

-   This trope is common in Disney works, as they not only avert Frothy Mugs of Water, but also show the results of excessive drinking:
    -   _The Aristocats_: Scat Cat and his band go running to help O'Malley save Duchess and the kittens, and Roquefort is running after them to catch up. They run past a man at a sidewalk café who, at the sight of a mouse apparently chasing a group of anxious cats, takes the bottle of wine off his table and sadly upends it onto the sidewalk.
    -   Seen in _Pinocchio_, where when Pinocchio sees his friend Lampwick starting to transform into a donkey. He pushes away the mug of beer he's drinking, and when it continues he looks at and then drops the cigar he had as well. Good thing, too, because the implication is that the drink and cigars are what's transforming Lampwick.
    -   In _The Princess and the Frog_, one of the party-goers at Charlotte's costume party did this after seeing a disembodied giraffe's head being chased by a dog dressed as a mermaid. Since he's wearing an octopus costume, he does it with _eight glasses at once_.
-   In one of the _Mater's Tall Tales_ shorts, Mater encounters a UFO (which, being a vehicle, is sentient). One of the things they do together is teaching Mater how to fly. While flying around, Mater at one point flies past Fillmore, who's drinking oil. Upon seeing Mater, Fillmore then silently pushes the oil can away with a disturbed expression.
-   A What Could Have Been example: In the original _My Little Pony_ movie, one of the ponies would search for help, crossing over into Hasbro's other cartoons in the process, including _The Transformers_ and _G.I. Joe_. When she arrived at the latter, she would encounter Shipwreck, who would swear off drinking as a result. Hasbro nixed it.
-   In _The Simpsons Movie_, the sight of a giant dome being lowered onto Springfield causes all the patrons of the bar to run into a church... and all the people in the church to run into the bar.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Ant-Man and the Wasp_, Stan Lee's character watches his car shrink down to shoe-sized and makes this remark:
    
    **Stan:** Well, the sixties were fun, but now I'm paying for it!
    
-   In _Asterix & Obelix: The Middle Kingdom_, Titanix takes a meaningful look at his pipe (which the reggae background music had implied was full of weed) after seeing Asterix and Obelix punch guys through the ceiling.
-   _Superman II_: General Zod sinks into a lake, then levitates himself to the surface and walks across it. Seeing this, a fisherman nearby looks at a cup of something he's drinking and throws it away.
-   _James Bond_: A Running Gag found in the Roger Moore films (which were Lighter and Softer than the previous and following ones).
    -   _The Spy Who Loved Me_: When Bond's car/submarine Lotus Esprit drives out of the ocean onto a beach in Sardinia, a wine-drinking beachgoer takes a bewildered look at his bottle.
    -   _Moonraker_: Bond drives an amphibious gondola up on the canals and ground streets of Venice. A man sees this and looks disbelievingly at the wine he's drinking. A different take on this trope happens slightly earlier, when an elderly chain-smoker throws away his cigarette after seeing a coffin floating in front of him (knocked off a hearse boat during a chase scene).
    -   _For Your Eyes Only_: Bond, on skis, slides across a restaurant table. It's the same guy as the two previous movies (actor Victor Tourjansky).
    -   _Octopussy_: a guard looks over the wall and sees a couple of elephants and some female circus acrobats forming a human ladder. He looks at the bottle in his hand in confusion, before Octopussy knocks him out with some hurled bolas.
-   _The Pink Panther (1963)_: Inspector Clouseau and the police are chasing both Phantoms, and everyone is in a ridiculous costume: the Phantoms are dressed as gorillas, Clouseau is a knight, and two police officers are in a zebra costume. For about five minutes, they somehow keep driving through the same intersection, passing the same disbelieving spectator with a bottle of whiskey. Eventually the drunk gets a chair and sits down to watch the rest of the shenanigans.
-   _Plan 9 from Outer Space_, in a Creator Cameo from Ed Wood. A bit Harsher in Hindsight considering his later alcoholism.
-   _The Giant Gila Monster_: after some guy sees the giant lizard cross the road. Apparently, drinking and driving simultaneously isn't a good idea.
-   Toyed with in _Dogma_. The characters, including Jay and Silent Bob, get teleported by an angel from the middle of the woods to a fancy restaurant. Jay looks at the joint he had been smoking and says, "Damn, I think this shit just kicked in!" and continues puffing away.
-   Shown in _Attack of the 60 Ft. Centerfold_, when a wandering drunk gives up booze upon seeing the titular protagonist.
-   _The Amazing Colossal Man_, where the sight of title giant causes one of the occupants of a car to toss away a bottle declaring "Not another drop as long as I live!" When Joel and the Bots riffed the movie, they lampshade the bottle toss _before_ the drunk even says the line.
-   Also happens with the prospector in _Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman_.
-   In _Bringing Up Baby_, the gardener starts drinking in response to the crazy goings-on, but pours out his bottle of whiskey when he sees the leopard.
-   At the end of _Ironweed_, the main character Francis sees his wife in a train car. When he realizes that she is a hallucination, he angrily throws his bottle of whiskey (and, symbolically, his alcoholism) out of the car. An extremely rare case where this trope is Played for Drama.
-   In _The Playhouse_, after being confounded by a pair of identical twins and a series of mirrors, Buster Keaton's character smashes his flask on the floor and writes, "I resolve never to drink anymore." After he realizes he's been dealing with not one girl, but two, he hastily appends the words, "but just as much."
-   In _Transporter 2_ a drunk bum is in an alley when he sees the heroes' car drive over him, straddling the buildings on either side of the alley. He then looks at his flask in complete shock.
-   In _X-Men: First Class_, after seeing Riptide demonstrate his power, Hendry's reaction is to ask what the hell Shaw put in his drink.
-   In _Flesh and the Devil_, the reverend, of all people, does this at the fancy ball, when he sees a pair of twins and believes he is seeing double.
-   A blink-and-you'll-miss-it version appears in the police chase scene in _Batman Begins_. A lot attendant, upon seeing the Batmobile and the police cars enter the parking structure, looks down at his drink as if there's something wrong with it.
-   _Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D._: When he saw Kabukiman fights off some thugs in Central Park, an African-American homeless man empties out his bottle of liquor on the pavement.
-   _Never Give a Sucker an Even Break_: W. C. Fields throws away his flask after coming face-to-face with a gorilla on a mountaintop in Russia.
-   Happens with a recurring background character in the Russian Super-Hero Film Black Lightning when he sees the car flying through the air, the first time sitting down to drink with friends he puts his glass down and seems ready to swear off drinking only to be shown buying the classic booze-in-a-brown-paper-bag later and promptly dropping it into the trash as he sees the flying car once again. Later is shown out jogging and thinking it'll stop him hallucinating flying cars (ironically jogging past the protagonist as he's out walking with his girlfriend), having somehow throughout the film seeing and hearing none of the news about the flying car being real.
-   _Wishmaster_: After wishing that the pharmacist who threw him out of the drug store contracted cancer and died, the bum watches in horror as tumors erupt all over the pharmacist's body and he collapses in pain. The bum then throws the cigarette he is smoking down in disgust.
-   _Our Gang_: In the silent short _Barnum & Ringling, Inc._, the Rascals hold a circus inside a fancy hotel, only for the the animals to get loose and wreak havoc. In one scene, a man (Oliver Hardy) is drinking some whiskey in his bathroom when he encounters an ostrich, which makes him think he's seeing things and pour the rest into the sink (from which the ostrich takes a sip).
-   In _Fly Away Home_, Amy and Thomas accidentally end up flying through downtown Baltimore after Thomas' navigational system quits on him while they're in heavy fog. In a news broadcast about the event, a reporter quips that, "If anybody is still into a two-martini lunch in Baltimore, they may swear off for good after this."
-   _Sunrise_: A server at a fancy restaurant in the city swigs wine straight from a bottle he is supposed to be serving. The escaped piglet from the funfair sneaks into the kitchen and gets tangled in a tablecloth in a way that resembles a Bedsheet Ghost; when the frightened server sees this, he drops the bottle on the ground and runs off.

    Literature 

-   In _Bored of the Rings_, the rather odd-looking party is camped out at a crossroads:
    
    Circling far overhead, unseen by the company, the leader of a band of black spy-crows peered through a pair of binoculars, cursed in the harsh tongue of his kind, and swore off grapes for the rest of his life.
    
-   According to one of the _Harry Potter_ supplemental books, events where small numbers of Muggles had seen some form of magic or magical creature were sometimes covered up by convincing them they'd had too much to drink.
-   In _The Hounds of the Morrigan,_ the Seargent decides he's _got_ to stop taking Quick Nips of his confiscated hooch when he starts seeing flying furniture. Of course, this is merely his Weirdness Censor in play—he really is seeing flying furniture, because a couple of witches have just moved in to the neighborhood.
-   _Harry's Mad_: After escaping his birdnapper and recovering under the care of another human, Madison the talking parrot tries to use a payphone to contact the human family looking after him. The only person who happens to see this is, of course, drunk, and promptly decides it's time he stopped.

-   In _Velveteen vs. The Junior Super Patriots_, any innocent river rat who saw the amassed crayfish would have sworn off everything for life, just to avoid the chance of seeing something like that twice.
-   A variant happens in _The Borrowers_. When the housekeeper finds the Borrowers and starts telling everyone she's seen tiny people in the house, Great-Aunt Sophie finds the idea hilarious. She tells the housemaid, "If you want to get rid of them, the answer is simple! Just keep the cork in." This makes sense, given that Great-Aunt Sophie has seen the Borrowers after she's been drinking, so she always attributes them to being drunken hallucinations.
-   Played with when Tom-Jon is transported to a world of talking animals in the first _Spellsinger_ book while high. He assumes he's hallucinating, but _doesn't_ think of this as a reason to quit so much as a reason to make sure he knows what he's actually got before he smokes it.
-   In _The Hundred and One Dalmatians_, a gentleman off to a Christmas party catches sight of the titular dogs _en masse_ and declares "And I haven't even _begun_ Christmas yet!"

-   Averted in A Sorceress in New York. When a homeless man sees Zara walk by, in casual clothes, he thinks nothing of it and takes a drink. But almost immediately afterwards, he sees Zara return in a more formal outfit.
    
    "Wow... this is some good beer!"

-   In an episode of _Smallville_, washed-up reporter/alcoholic Perry White is wandering through the titular town, and his visit happens to coincide with sunspot activity that's causing Clark Kent's powers to fluctuate uncontrollably. A tractor gets stuck in the mud, and Clark tries lifting it out of the mud, but his super strength is gone... and then it suddenly comes back, and he accidentally launches the tractor into the stratosphere.

Serena tries to have some fun, making Samantha's low quality bust almost perfect, make one of Darrin's boss too, _and_ make them both _talk_. After seeing this too much, Darrin's poor boss thinks he's hallucinating and decides to call himself a ride home, and when Samantha suggests he have a drink, he shouts, "Never again! When it goes from pink elephants to talking rocks, you know it's time to get on the wagon!" (So this was very much a Nice Job Fixing It, Villain for Serena, although Samantha and Darrin were still stuck with the two talking sculptures at the end.)

-   One clip for The Worlds Dumbest had Mike Trainor do this.
-   _Lexx_ episode "Prime Ridge" has this with the booze-loving realtor seeing a moth parked in the garage. This being Lexx, she empties the whole bottle after some thoughts, so it probably its best described as this trope _and_ I Need a Freaking Drink.
-   A Running Gag in _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_ has Mr Kraft try and rationalise some of the weirder things he's seen around Sabrina as something he bought and ate, usually from a dodgy source.
-   The _Still Standing_ episode "Still Parading" has a subplot about Tina, the youngest Miller, getting sick and enjoying the way her cough medicine tastes.

-   Happens in _Neverwinter Nights 2_:
    
    **Khelgar:** Just to make sure my eyes aren't lying to me—a huge suit of armor did smash through here, attack the githyanki—and us—then we drove it back to the portal?  
    **Neeshka:** No... no, that's about right.  
    **Khelgar:** Good. Because if my drinking is catching up with me, I'm stopping right now.
    
-   In _Persona 5 Strikers_, when the Phantom Thieves first bring Zenkichi into the Metaverse, he immediately assumes that he drank _way_ too much and is hallucinating. This is _after_ the Phantom Thieves already explained everything to him. It takes several more minutes of convincing for him to even _begin_ to believe he's not crazy.
-   In _Spellcasting 201_, as part of the initiation trials of the Hu Delta Phart fraternity, you have to break into the basement of the Tappa Kegga Bru fraternity and steal their mascot... an elephant. After seeing the elephant get magically shrunk down until it can fit down the manhole cover, and the manhole cover float off the ground, the guard throws away his beer (Why he doesn't realize that this means magic is involved, when he's in a school for magic, is never mentioned. Maybe he's just too drunk to think about that). Then he rethinks things, and picks the mug up again.
-   One of the standard enemy reactions to catching a glimpse of Garret in _Thief: Deadly Shadows_ is "I need to take it easy with the wine..."

    Real Life 

-   Some of the spectacular visual effects from _Inception_ were created in Real Life, rather than relying in CGI.

When the producer answered in the affirmative, the bum decided that maybe he was drinking too much.
