You want to reverse the polarity on your particle defibrillator? Better get it to Mr. Fixit quickly.

It doesn't matter if Mr. Fixit has never seen _it_ before, has never seen anything like it before, is unfamiliar with its working principles or doesn't even know the stuff the box is made out of; Mr. Fixit will be able to reverse engineer it in time for the big finale. He will often possess Machine Empathy, and can diagnose a broken gadget just by looking at it.

Overlaps with Mad Scientist, though not all Mr. Fixits are scientists or doctors; some are just avid tinkerers with a lot of free time. Compare Wrench Wench. Often overlaps with Gadgeteer Genius. Subtrope of The Engineer. Occasionally keep themselves in work by means of Tim Taylor Technology, which creates more things to fix.

Unrelated to The Incredible Hulk, who used the alias "Mr. Fixit" in the late 1980s. And no, this page does not center around the fox in Richard Scarry's Busytown, either (although he is an example of this trope).

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Dragon Ball_: Bulma is a clear example. Able to build nearly anything with time and resources. She even took an alien scouter, and within a few hours or days, somehow changed its language from whatever alien space language it used, to Japanese (or English, or whatever language)!
    -   It should be noted that the scouter did not display a language, only numbers, and deciphering a numbering system is actually very easy to figure out, relative to a language at least. Deciphering an operating system written in a different numbering system and converting it to display a new language. More impressive was her ability to do repairs on the alien vehicle that they reverse engineered ... as a young girl.
    -   It's In the Blood: Bulma's son, Trunks, also has a knack for figuring out alien tech. He was able to repair the alien Robot Buddy Giru with little issue.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: Leeron Theoretically, every device after the timeskip could be his invention, or a descendant of something invented. Yes, one man started his whole planet's industrial revolution.
-   _Magic Knight Rayearth_: Presea and in the anime, her Backup Twin Sierra can create and repair _any_ type of weapon.

-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_:
    -   Yusei Fudo grew up in the slums of Satellite, but that didn't stop him from teaching himself mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering to the point where he could build his own D-Wheel from the scrap and spare parts tossed away by the people of New Domino... twice. Thrice if you've watched the Japanese version. He also made a Duel Board (a skateboard with D-wheel capabilities) just by _hearing about it_ from Rua... **'in one night**'! Understandable, since his parents were top scientists.
    -   Also Bruno, who on his first appearance managed to increase the power of the guys' D-Wheels where Yusei couldn't.

-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_: Winry shows the ability to fix most mechanical gadgets and break open locks (sealed with alchemy!) in addition to being a master of fixing automail.
-   _Speed Racer_: Lionel "Pops" Racer. He's the one who designed and built the Mach 5.
-   On _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_, Howard fixes Duo's Gundam, and makes a living selling scrap metal and refurbishing weapons and the like. Duo learned from him, and (despite his Fanon reputation as a klutz) is quite an accomplished tinkerer himself.
-   _Girls und Panzer_ has the Automobile Club serve as this, with many an Offscreen Moment of Awesome as well.
    -   First is fixing five abandoned Panzers overnight. Five Panzers, all of which were abandoned for 20 years and left in the most ungodly places imaginable. Only one of the Panzers was found in storage — the rest were scattered over the academy, with the prize going to the StuG III left in a pond and the Type 89 I-Go in a crevice, on a cliff, at a minimum of fifty feet from either the top and bottom of the cliff.
    -   Second comes in restoring the Tiger (P) or Porsche Tiger, an infamously difficult beast, as well as maintaining it _while driving it_. To quote, (After the Panzer throws a track, stalls out, and catches fire in the space of a minute) "Aw, here we go again, eh? Hoshino! Hand me the fire extinguisher!"

    Comic Books 

-   _The DCU_:
    -   _Batman_: From the late '80s to early 2000s, Batman has the mechanical genius Harold Allnut working for him on his various vehicles and the cave itself.
    -   Justice League International often turns to Kilowog of the Green Lantern Corps for all their tech needs. The most extreme example is probably when he built the Club JLI resort on the island of KooeyKooeyKooey for Booster Gold and Blue Beetle in a matter of hours. In later incarnations of the team, this role is taken by Steel and Mister Terrific. Both characters are also Genius Bruisers.
    -   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: H'Elgn is able to fix up or direct the repairs and modification of a wide array of space vessels captured from the Sangtee Empire, whips up a bionic eye for one of the revolutionaries whose eyes were put out by the empire, and builds a long distance holographic device to further spread their message and trick empire agents.
-   _Marvel Universe_: Taken to the extreme in Forge, whose mutant ability helps him build machines by simply imagining what they should do, rather than working out the pesky details.
-   _Promethea_ has an unusual example — Stan of the Five Swell Guys is clearly the Mr. Fixit of the team, but Marv claims to be the team genius. This subversion of Superhero Speciation becomes a plot-point when it's revealed that Stan created the team's arch-nemesis, the Painted Doll, due to his resentment of Marv.
-   Death's Head's Sidekick Spratt is pretty competent with a toolbox, and rebuilt Death's Head after he was nearly destroyed by the Dragon's Claws, although not to the level of a Gadgeteer Genius.

-   _PS238_: Herschel Clay, a.k.a. "Mantium". As the janitor for a school for metahumans, he's (obviously) a metahuman himself and has a love of tinkering. He's also implied to own Clay Industries, which sells most of the inventory, security doodads, and other components of the school and its security system. Exactly why the owner and main braintrust for a (presumably) multinational corporation works as a janitor at a school is anyone's guess.

    Film — Animation 

-   _Wreck-It Ralph_: Fix-It Felix Jr., thanks to his magic golden hammer that can fix anything by just whacking it. In a twist of irony, this actually comes back to bite him when he's imprisoned in King Candy's castle, because any attempts to break the bars on his cell only end up fixing them so that they're stronger than before.
-   _Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure_: One of the male toys in Marcella's nursery is Maxie Fixit, who can open his head and literally pull tools out of his brain.
-   _Planes: Fire & Rescue_: Maru. If he can't get the necessary piece, he'll make it from scratch. "It's not new, it's _better_ than new."

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Lucky Star_: After World War I renders him a paraplegic, Tim becomes this. As he explains it, "Never thought much about broken things, until I got smashed up myself. That gave me the idea."
-   _My Name is Khan_: Rizwan Khan has the ability to repair almost anything. Eventually he uses that talent to earn some money.
-   In _The Gatling Gun_, Camp Cook Tin Pot has real talent for mechanical contrivances, and is able to file down a railroad spike to juryrig a firing pin for the Gatling gun. However, it breaks after one firing because he has no means of tempering it.
-   _Marvin's Room_: During Lee's second visit to the mental hospital to talk to Hank, she takes note of his dirty appearance, and he tells her that he's been working on an engine. Later on, he becomes fascinated with his grandfather's old tools, and Bessie bequeaths them to him. He eventually fixes Bessie's garage door with his newly acquired tools.

    Literature 

-   _Dragonlance_: Tinker Gnomes of Krynn. Of course it may not work as their non-gnome friends would hope. The Device of Time Journeying in particular could be repaired by any gnome (even one who thinks it's a meat grinder), although it's not mechanical and the parts consist of pieces of gold, a chain, and a couple thousand gemstones.
-   _Busytown_ features a recurring character called Mr. Fixit, a fox repairman who can repair anything.
-   In _Alien in a Small Town,_ Indira is an ex-engineer from a space station, where she was known as the "Fix-It Lady." Now living in a small town, she opens a repair shop called the Fix-It Shop.

-   _The Yellow Bag_: The House of Repairs features an entire family of people who can fix anything, from furniture and electronics to a real, live dog. They are the ones who fix the Umbrella after she breaks a few ribs.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Auction Kings_, Delfino can fix just about anything. Only once has he been forced to get outside help (The Calliope).
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_: Chief Tyrol and Specialist Cally. Hell, even Starbuck gets into the tech mood now and then (see the Cylon Raider in the first season).
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Warren might be an example of a villainous Mr. Fixit, while Willow was something of a Ms. Fixit.

-   _Doctor Who_: The Doctor has a tendency to be a Mr. Fixit, though he usually _has_ seen, encountered, disassembled, built, and even _created_ some of the items in question. Not that that's a requirement. In "Utopia", he fixes a rocket mere minutes after admitting he has no idea how it works. What's great is that he applies his own superior-in-normal-circumstances knowledge which gives him a "so obvious they overlooked it" answer (reverse the circuit).
    -   Perkins the engineer from "Mummy on the Orient Express" is implied to be this, to the point of suggesting that the Doctor replace a couple of the TARDIS' drive stacks.
-   _Firefly_: Kaylee demonstrates her prowess while having... relations... with her predecessor on _Serenity_. Literally. She was on her back on the engine room floor and she saw what was wrong with the engine while the mechanic was preoccupied with being on top of her. It's implied that she made out with him specifically in order to get a chance to look at the engine of a real spaceship.
-   _Gilligan's Island_: The Professor made a freakin' car out of Bamboo Technology, which was actually spoofed in an episode of _VeggieTales_.

-   _M\*A\*S\*H_: Referenced by name in an episode where the nurses wake up Hawkeye (strange in itself given that he's the chief surgeon and dangerously overworked) to fix the heater in their tent. Turns out he's better at fixing people than heaters.

-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
    -   Miles O'Brien. Being a character transplanted from _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, he only displays this same skillset on that show if something goes wrong with a transporter, and then only under Geordi La Forge's supervision.
    -   Rom is dimwitted about everything but technology. He's the only person who understands the mix of Cardassian, Federation, Bajoran and Ferengi parts (as well as several cooking utensils) that make up the electrical components of Quark's bar. His son Nog (also a promising engineer) claims that he could be the Chief Engineer of a starship with the right breaks.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_: Harry Kim may be an Ensign fresh out of the Academy, but he's almost as much of a mechanical whiz as B'Elanna Torres. He often pitches in with the engineering duties on board the ship and is recognised as an expert on holo-technology. The main difference between Harry and B'Elanna is that while B'Elanna is great at working on her feet with limited resources, Harry is better at theory and design.

-   _MacGyver (1985)_: The guy built a glider out of trash and junk in an attic.
-   _NCIS_: Gibbs with anything mechanical as showcased in _Power Down_. If it's got electricity running through it, you're pretty much screwed. Let's not even think about computers. But has the power gone out and do you need to make copies with a machine no one has used or heard of in hundred years? Gibbs's got your back. That's okay though, if it _does_ have electricity, odds are both McGee _and_ Abbey are capable of fixing it.
-   _JAG_: Meg Austin in the first season, if it's got anything to do with fixing computers or computerized weapons systems.
-   _Sesame Street_: Luis and Maria. They run the local fix-it shop.
-   _The Red Green Show_: Red Green is something of a subversion. He fancies himself a practical Mr. Fixit, but his duct tape reinforced inventions seem to work _in spite_ of his best efforts.
-   _Just Add Magic_: The "Chicken n' Fixits" spell can turn whoever it's used on into this. However, unless they finish the task they originally set out to do, they'll become obsessed with fixing anything and everything they see.

    Music 

-   Jason Mraz: "Frank D. Fixer", about his grandfather.
-   Frank Zappa: Subverted in _Flakes_ from _Sheik Yerbouti_, where the repair men are incompetent beyond the term itself.

    Pinball 

-   _Lexy Lightspeed - Escape from Earth_: Ronnie Earl can fix anything with nothing more than duct tape, bubble gum, and a few parts from Area 53.1.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _The World of Darkness_:
    -   _Old World of Darkness_:
        -   Some character types from various settings are dab hands at smash repairs, including Sons of Ether from _Mage: The Ascension_ (who think they're doing Science rather than magic) and Glass Walkers from _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_ (who could talk to the spirits of machines).
        -   _Changeling: The Dreaming_: Nockers. They've go a knack for all things mechanical, and can fix broken machines by giving them a good hard thump or scowling and telling them off.
    -   In _Changeling: The Lost_, the Wizened often take on this role. They have access to Contracts that allow them to make a hovercraft out of a lawnmower and an inner tube.
    -   _Princess: The Hopeful_: Menders are a cross between this and the Medic; either way they fulfill their calling by fixing things (since healing can be redefined as "repairing living beings"). Some Restore charms can also be used to repair items, such as Jury Rigger which temporarily restores a broken machine to Durability 1. Princesses who are followers of the Queen of Diamonds or the Ambassador to the Machine can be this as well.
-   _Pathfinder_: Bulabars, a type of fey embodying the emergence of tool use in nature, will cheerfully fix broken objects as they come across them, and even repair their enemies' broken gear once hostilities end — they can't stand seeing useful mechanisms be broken.
-   In _Traveller_, Sword Worlders have a great admiration for this. They make machines specifically to make them easy for a Determined Homesteader to tinker with.
-   _Spirit of the Century_: The literal "Mister Fix-It" stunt serves mainly to reduces repair times to about one-quarter normal; this doesn't _directly_ provide any bonuses to the attempt, but does essentially allow the character to more easily take "extra time" as required.

    Video Games 

-   _Battletech_: By the standards of the setting, Yang's ability to restore, rewire and remodel Battlemechs in a few days is nothing short of miraculous even before he gets access to the Argo, which was designed to carry entire colonies' worth of material and allows him near-infinite space for tinkering and storage. Depending on game rules and how much you upgrade his mechlab, Yang is able to weld together pieces of disparate 'mech wrecks back into fully operational machines complete with weapon loadouts, and remodel them with a speed and flexibility only beaten by OmniMechs in the lore. Speaking with him implies Yang could easily get a job in any Inner Sphere house, but he likes working with a small-time merc outfit _because_ it gives him the freedom to tinker.
-   _Brain Dead 13_: In the intro, Lance Galahad is adamant at fixing computers, and sees that the way to fix one computer is by using bubble gum for connection... or at least a snotty substitute. Unfortunately, all this is slowly and suddenly going to hell...
-   _Brütal Legend_: Eddie Riggs, as the ultimate roadie can make and fix any stage equipment given the time and resources.
-   _Chrono Trigger_: Lucca single-handedly fixes a robot made with distant future technology, not once, not twice, but on three separate occasions.
-   _Constructor_: "Mr. Fixit" is an inversion: he's a cowboy builder who the player can send to sabotage the opposition's houses by "repairing" the plumbing, electrics or gas.

-   In _Dicey Dungeons_, Ned is The Blacksmith and repairman for everyone in the dungeon, which is why he's so popular.
-   _EarthBound (1994)_: Jeff. All you needed is a place to sleep for the night and he can turn your Broken Iron into a Slime Generator, provided that his IQ stat is high enough.
-   _Fallout: New Vegas_: A Courier with high Science and Repair skill is exactly this. The unskilled can fix anything given spare parts, high Repair allows a courier to fix anything mechanical _without_ spare parts, and high Science to fix anything electronical, here again without spare parts. Fuse boxes, solar panels, busted eyebot, faulty compass, faulty navigational computer, food processors, a Matter Replicator... Of course, such skills also allow for sabotage. Jury-Rigging, a perk the Courier can take, is an even worse offender, allowing to fix a Power Fist with Red Boxing Gloves, an anti-material Sniper Rifle with a BB Gun, a suit of Power Armor with ordinary metal armor, leather armor with a business suit, a light bulletproof vest with the previous two pieces of clothing... How does the courier do it? Only s/he knows.
-   _Gears of War_: Anything at all break down for Delta Squad? Damon Baird's on it, with a growl, and a sarcastic comment about how much you guys suck at fixing things. Seriously, this guy basically repairs everything in the game. And then gives you lip about it. If he weren't so funny, (and your allies weren't immune to friendly fire) he'd probably have eaten a shotgun by now. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Granblue Fantasy_: Helnar. As shown in the event "A Slice of Summer" and the beginning of his 5★ upgrade Fate Episode, he knows how to draw up blueprints and fix up his robot-bird friend with relative ease.
-   _Homeworld_ is one of the worst offenders regarding this trope. Within minutes of encountering an enemy vessel you've never seen before, you are informed that your own research team is ready to build an identical ship. Even when the ship in question is a millions-year old Precursor machine that's been lost to time, your trusty Hiigaran scientists can quickly devise countermeasures to them and even reverse-engineer them to produce copies.
-   _Jagged Alliance_: Both Trevor and Static start with the highest mechanical skill and can pretty much repair anything ingame.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games_: In _Ages_, Patch lives atop Restoration Wall and has the expertise to repair just about anything someone might bring him—provided they participate in his "trap, er...ceremony". Link is required to bring him a broken nut from Symmetry Village to repair it and restore its symmetry. Later, once Link obtains the Broken Sword at the end of a long Fetch Quest, he can bring it to Patch who will transform it into the Noble Sword (or the Master Sword, if the player already has the Noble Sword by means of a Linked Game).
-   _Mad Max (2015)_: Max's companion Chumbucket is a mechanical prodigy, able to turn the Magnum Opus from a rusty hull to a battle-ready Weaponized Car with little aside from scrap metal and repair major damage in seconds. While Max views the Opus as a simple means of transportation, Chumbucket sees it as a religious artifact.
-   _Mass Effect_: The Quarians are an entire race of master mechanics, as they live a space-bound existence on giant Generation Ships which also happen to be very old and pretty much constantly in a state of falling apart.
-   In _No Umbrellas Allowed_, the owner of 1st Repair Shop can fix up to two of your broken items a day as long as they're "Fairly Damaged" or worse. Depending on the item's other attributes, he can either fix it immediately or take an extra day to do so, but he can't repair "Totally Wrecked" items.
-   _Ratchet & Clank_: Ratchet is not only a One-Lombax Army, but also a qualified mechanic and inventor, and is capable of fixing pretty much anything. However, when it comes to repairs made by Ratchet, or any other Lombax, actual results may vary. Then there's the Plumber, appearing frequently since _Ratchet & Clank (2002)_, and also capable of repairs on all sorts of wacky stuff; however, he does prefer to focus on actual plumbing.
-   In _Scrap Mechanic_, the Player Characters are, among other things, this. The game casts the players as Gadgeteer Geniuses who can have their own creations break down or malfunction, or — come the implementation of Survival Mode — encounter pre-existing broken machinery on their travels around the gameworld. Naturally, a lot of fixing, scavenging, and MacGyvering is bound to occur.

-   _Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords_: Bao-Dur . The player character in both games can become one as well, if his/her "Repair" skill is high enough.
-   _Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People_ has the world of video games and _Homestar Runner_ merging, turning the Poopsmith into "Mista Fixit", who naturally can fix broken objects.
-   _Team Fortress 2_: The Engineer, although he's better at making weapons than actually fixing stuff.
-   The _Wing Commander_ games have a long series of Mr Fixits, in the form of the various crew chiefs that keep your fighter flying sometimes via the combined magics of Duct Tape and strong language. Nicknames for these folks include "Sparks" and "Pliers".

    Visual Novels 

-   The protagonist of _Daughter for Dessert_ generally fixes everything in the diner himself rather than calling professionals. Kathy questions him about why he finds it so easy when he’s about to fix the dishwasher, and he handwaves it by stating that he just sees the logic of it.
-   Lampshaded by Becca in _Melody_ if the protagonist offers to fix her faucet. She calls him “my personal Mr. Fixit.”
-   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice_, the DLC case "Turnabout Time-Traveller" has Pierce Nichody, the Sprocket Family mechanic, although he often just gives whatever is broken to his shoulder robot FIXR-UPR, such as an antique radio Maya smashed by accident. It's repaired in seconds. Once you push him far enough in court, he upgrades FIXR-UPR in a matter of seconds, including giving it a working X-ray device as he enters his One-Winged Angel state.

    Web Animation 

-   _Happy Tree Friends_: Handy, but only if said fixing takes place off-screen. If not, his lack of hands will trip him up.

    Webcomics 

-   _Check, Please!_: Dex is a compsci major that usually fixes stuff around the Haus, particularly appliances as the oven and the washing machine.

-   _Girl Genius_: Sparks are most often notable for their ability to fairly ridiculous things with machinery, such as taking wrecked applicants and turning them into Steampunk mad science devices with only a few boxes of spare parts. Double Subverted all the time, as they often have their projects explode several times in the building progress. Notably, Agatha had a coffee maker she was working on explode, but went on to finish the coffee maker so well that it makes _perfect_ coffee.
-   _The Whiteboard_: Doc can fix just about anything without much trouble (notably, his _paintball shop_ carries _car parts._). The questions are whether he'll accept the job, whether he'll do it without clobbering you for doing whatever dumb thing you did to break it, and whether it'll come back to you without any unspecified nuclear components added.
    
    **Doc:** With the right filler rod I can fix the crack of dawn.
    

    Web Original 

-   _Red vs. Blue_:
    -   Sarge. Lopez and Tex have good (if not better) mechanical skills too, but Sarge takes home the trophy for the _way_ in which he goes about his repairs, such as somehow repairing a jeep without any tools or spare parts. Or better yet, rebuilding Simmons as a cyborg and using the leftover body parts to heal Grif after he was run over by a tank.
    -   Caboose, despite being a flagrant dumbass, has shown considerable skill at maintaining and operating technology. While this was originally limited to getting along well with AI, this has developed into an ability to activate and repair highly rare robotics.
-   _Whateley Universe_: There are dozens of such kids at the Academy. The mutant powers 'gadgeteer' and 'deviser' basically give a person this kind of power. Some are better at building their own devises, and some are better at working on others' gadgets. The side character codenamed Belphegor is excellent at taking other gadgets and devises and adapting them to his needs. However, he tends to steal other people's stuff before doing the adaptation bit.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Busy World of Richard Scarry_ has a town repair man (fox, actually) whose name is literally Mr. Fixit.
-   _Beast Wars_: Rhinox manages to create a device for "Extracting Metaphysical Essence from some alien probe." when Rattrap tells him to. Of course he isn't sure it'll work, but it does.
-   _Beavis And Butthead_: For all his senility and poor judgment when it comes to dealing with Beavis and Butt-head, Tom Anderson is a very focused and skilled handyman. In the 2022 revival, he was even able to fix a malfunctioning anal-probing device on an interdimensional spaceship that was likely more technologically advanced than anything on Earth.
-   _Bob's Burgers_ has Teddy the Handyman as a regular customer (and, as of Season 4, regular character). He's introduced in the second episode of the show fixing a leaky roof, but as time goes by, he becomes a jack-of-all-trades who can do anything that involves building and fixing. He does plumbing, wiring, even elevator maintenance. It's revealed in Season 8 that in his apartment is an entire room filled floor-to-ceiling with things he knows how to fix, but hasn't gotten around to yet (until the Belchers convince him to throw most of them away).

-   _Darkwing Duck_: Drake Mallard repeatedly _calls_ himself this in "Dry Hard", but there's little evidence to support it — until the ending sequence.

-   The titular trio in _Ed, Edd n Eddy_ tried this scam in "Rent-A-Ed", where they try to repair appliances, but they— though, mostly Ed— end up breaking more things than they can fix, from Jimmy's bedroom (due to Ed chucking Jimmy's oven, with a jammed door, into his bedroom wall, causing his cookies to be so burnt up after the oven door was jammed, they make holes in the floor) to everything in Jonny's house (from the sink to the heat radiator— where they decided to do a spa scam— all the way to the support beam Ed was tied to during the aforementioned scam to keep him from wrecking anything else) to the point the whole house collapses.

-   _TaleSpin_: Wildcat. Despite not being the sharpest tool in the shed, he's a crackerjack mechanic, able to fix anything in record time. When he's introduced in the pilot, Baloo has him demonstrate this ability by breaking the phone and giving it to Wildcat. Seconds later it's as good as new, just in time to receive a call.

-   _Teen Titans_: Fixit. Not only can he fix anything, but he chose the name "Fixit" for himself.
-   _PAW Patrol_: Rocky assumes this role among the pups due to the extensive collection of usable materials he's collected and the equipment in his pack.
-   Skips from _Regular Show_. Except when it comes to computers.

-   _Gravity Falls_: Soos. At one point, he manages to turn a broken golf cart into a functioning _rocket car_.
-   _Kaeloo_: Mr. Cat. In one episode, he somehow manages to fix a broken _time machine_.
-   _Ready Jet Go!_:
    -   Jet, who is nearly always building something, and is pretty handy with tools. It's worth mentioning that he, a child, _managed to fix a broken satellite_ by himself.
    -   In "One Small Step", Sydney is able to fix the super saucer with general ease, with the help of Jet 2, of course.
-   _My Little Pony: Rainbow Roadtrip_: Torque Wrench is a repairpony by profession and can fix anything brought to her shop, from broken signs and crashed balloons to thoroughly wrecked Magitek devices.
-   _Molly of Denali_: Mr. Patak, who runs the wood shop in Qyah, can fix just about anything.

    Real Life 

-   Noah Antwiler of _The Spoony Experiment_ fame got an Atari Jaguar to work by constructing a monstrous amalgamation of technology.
-   Fred Dibnah became this on British TV; he boasted that given enough time and greasy rags he could restore anything that worked with steam propulsion.
