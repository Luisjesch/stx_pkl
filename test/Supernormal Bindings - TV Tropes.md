Gods in chains.

_You cannot break this cage's bars. They are forged from the same principles that bind people to their positions in society; more, that bind identities. Perhaps if you had a_ very _sturdy saw, and a few centuries to spare, you could begin to scratch a single bar._

So you've just captured a wizard, a fairy, a spirit, a ghost, maybe Superman or even a god. Congratulations! Now how do you keep them from escaping? Ordinary rope or handcuffs won't do the trick, they could just use magic to make them come undone or maybe just break them or pass right through them. What you need are special restraints that are either so strong _nothing_ short of the universe collapsing can break them, or the restraints somehow counteract the prisoners' powers, rendering them harmless as long as they're bound by the restraints.

This trope covers ropes, chains, handcuffs, shackles, straitjackets, and other things along those lines which are capable of holding these extraordinary beings without them being able to get out of them.

Most likely some form of Applied Phlebotinum, probably as a Power Nullifier, and chances are you'll find something like this in a Tailor-Made Prison or Extranormal Prison, but may just as well be used outside them.

Anything that does not actually restrain the limbs in some way is Not This Trope. Bracelets, anklets, necklaces or anything else that simply limits or removes their abilities is a Power Nullifier.

-   In _Hunter × Hunter_, Kurapika's "Chain Jail" Nen ability is a powerful Variable-Length Chain made of Nen that prevents physical movement and seals its victim's Nen. Kurapika enhanced its power by setting the condition that he can only use it against the members of the Genei Ryodan/Phantom Troupe — if he uses it against anyone else, he will _die_.
-   There exist unique handcuffs in _One Piece_ made of a special substance called "sea prism stone" that nullify the powers of a Devil Fruit user. They're nearly impossible to break, too.

     Comic Books  

-   In _The DCU_, Grimbor the Chainsman was a villain who specialized in creating restraints for use on superpowered characters.
-   Rather common in _Hellboy_ and _B.P.R.D._ when dealing with demons. When attempting a summoning, anyone with half an ounce of sense will use some magical binding or words of power to prevent the demon from leaving the summoning circle. (Of course, anyone with a full ounce of sense wouldn't be summoning demons in the first place, because things always manage to go wrong even with these barriers in place.)
-   Doctor Strange uses a "Crimson Bands of Cyttorak" spell to tie up superpowered evildoers, and The Incredible Hulk when he's rampaging.
-   In the third arc of _W.I.T.C.H._ a Bashee is shown to be bound with something that looks like vines and which can only be undone by the one who imprisoned her, but Will is able to break them with the Heart of Kandrakar's power.
-   When the Bunny from Beyond captured Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!, most of them received Power Nullifier prisons. Since presumably there was no way to nullify "really, really strong," Captain Carrot was held in special manacles and Pig-Iron's limbs were pinned in place with magnets.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   The Lasso of Hestia (a.k.a. the Lasso of Truth) is unbreakable, and whoever is bound in it cannot free themselves (depending on the writer) and is forced to answer questions, and to answer honestly. It can also extend magically (having been used to wrap the Earth multiple times). It is crafted by Hephaestus of magical gold and the concept of the truth.
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: During the Golden Age Diana and the other Amazons were already wearing the restraints that would depower them with just some assembly required. Their bracelets of submission just needed to be welded together by a man to drain them of their superhuman abilities, and given Marston's love of bondage villains would unknowingly stumble upon this weakness with alarming frequency.
    -   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: The Sangtee Empire held the Daxamite later nicknamed Julia in bindings designed to immobilize and de-power her. Diana disabled the power to them during her slave revolt.
-   _Irredeemable_ has the main character bound by aliens using cloned strips of his own invulnerable flesh.

It cannot by melted by their fire, and it strangles them when they continue struggling. The only existing one was forged by Celebrimbor who didn't craft another one because he was horrified at how the first dragon contained with it killed itself in claustrophobic panic. Gandalf recovers the chain from the Iron Hills to be used against the dragon — a still living Smaug — signed in Dorwinion. After Smaug's knocked unconscious, he's restrained with the chain, forcing him to bargain himself free to find and rescue Kathryn in time.
-   _The Dark Lords of Nerima_: Helios' sister Melinoe, the guardian of nightmares, is restrained with chains marked with powerful runes that keep her bound to the dream realm so that she can't run rampant through human nightmares. Continued usage of the Golden Crystal weakens them, though.

    Their attention was drawn to the red-and-yellow-clad man whose body was held pent in metallic bands that encircled his chest, arms, legs, waist, ankles, and neck. Two electrodes protruding from opposite walls held him in something like a stasis field. But how could even those hold Captain Marvel?  
    "What've you got him in?" asked Magnificus.  
    Sivana, Jr. answered. "Oh, it's really great. Ironic, too. You see, those metal bonds holding him are made of Marvelium. That's a metal Big Red himself discovered. Only he was able to work it, it was so hard."  
    "That was before," chortled Georgia. "Before Daddy powered up Ibac and all the rest. It took them a lot of effort, but they managed it."  
    "The stasis beam prevents him from using his flight power to simply fly off with the Marvelium around him," confided Sivana.

-   In _The Emperor's Soul_, Shai is bound with chains made of ralkalest metal<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , preventing her from Forging the shackles to make them defective. Interestingly, ralkalest is a fairly weak metal, so if she'd really wanted to, Shai could probably have Forged tools to break the chains.
-   During the treasure hunt in _Myth-ion Impossible_, the Shifter tries to reach the treasure alone and ends up being captured and infected. Aahz is able to restrain her with a magical rope ... but privately tells Skeeve that she'll be using that rope every full moon for the rest of her life.

-   In _Faded Steel Heat_, captured shapechangers cannot be restrained by normal shackles, but thin silver chains from Nicks's personal jewelry suffice to bind them. Garrett fully expects the strands won't be strong enough, but because silver is baneful to the shifters they can't muster the strength to break loose.
-   In _Lords and Ladies_, Granny Weatherwax lassos and binds the unicorn with _one of her own hairs_. Although witnesses most likely assumed she used witchcraft to do this, it's actually Virgin Power at work.

-   _The Silmarillion_ has Angainor, the chain used to bind Melkor/Morgoth after his first war against the Valar and again after the War of Wrath.

In earlier writings Tolkien specified that it was made from six metals, plus a seventh magically created from the first six, plus a lot of spells.
-   _The Witcher_ has Dimeritium: a fictional metal with a special property that represses magical energy. Shackles made from it are often used to restrain captured mages, as nothing else is capable of holding them for very long.

     Live Action TV  

-   _Doctor Who_: "Warriors' Gate" featured a "time-sensitive" race who had been enslaved because their abilities made them useful in navigating through hyperspace; their restraints had to be made from a special super-dense material extracted from white dwarf stars to pin them down to a single place and time and prevent them escaping.
    -   Dwarf star material appears several more times in the series, such as when the Doctor uses such chains on the Father of The Family of Blood and drops him down a shaft.
-   An episode of _Smallville_ has handcuffs with kryptonite in them which are used on Kara Kent. In another episode, the goddess Isis tied Clark Kent to a table with magic ropes he was unable to break. However, he was able to escape by pulling until the table broke and then untangling himself from the now loose ropes.
-   _Supernatural_ has sets of shackles intended to restrain demons.
-   In _True Blood_, vampires are typically restrained with silver chains or handcuffs, since silver hurts and paralyzes them. It's not uncommon for a silver necklace to be used as a garrotte wire, and simply placing one on top of a vampire's wrist acts as if it's an impossibly heavy weight.
-   _WandaVision_: Two instances of magically conjured chains in "Previously On..."
    -   First when Agatha is bound to a stake prior to being judged by her coven.

     Mythology & Religion  

-   In Norse Mythology, the gods had the dwarves create a magical chain called Gleipnir to bind the mighty wolf Fenrir. To make Gleipnir impossible to break (at least until Ragnarok), it was made of six impossible things: the sound of a cat's footfall, the beard of a woman, the roots of a mountain, the sinews of a bear, the breath of a fish and the spittle of a bird. Fenrir's father Loki, would later be bound by the transmuted guts of one of his other children, thus making him bound by ties of kinship. Since the only people with any interest in freeing him were his kin, that made them effectively unbreakable until Ragnarok.
-   In _The Bible_: From Jude 1:6:
    
    _Likewise, the angels who did not keep to their first domain, but forsook their own dwelling, He has kept in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day._
    
    -   Also from the Bible: Jesus' comment to Peter in the gospel of Matthew that "whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven" is often intepreted in Pentecostal circles as Jesus giving authority to believers to "bind" and "loose" spirits in this fashion. Also Jesus' comment, which is used to support this interpretation: “No one can enter a strong man’s house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man’s house.” (Mark 3:27)
    -   In the book of Revelation, a great angel with a chain in his hand binds up Satan and seals him up into the Bottomless Pit for a thousand years, after which he will be loosed for a season.

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_
    -   In the _Forgotten Realms_ setting the gods bet Kezef the Chaos Hound, an expy of Fenrir, that they could forge a chain that would hold him. Gond, god of craftsmen, forged the chain and buried its anchor miles deep in the rock of Pandemonium, and Mystra, goddess of magic, wrapped him in a self-repairing magical curtain. The two traps successfully held Kezef for millennia until he was freed by one of Cyric's plots.
    -   Basic D&D adventure IM2 _The Wrath of Olympus_. A group of Immortals (minor deities) illegally interferes on the Prime Plane. The forces of Entropy capture them and secure them with chains that not only render them helpless but drain their internal power (Life Energy) as well.
    -   Basic D&D supplement _The Book of Marvelous Magic_. Irons are magical confinement devices combining manacles (wrists) and shackles (ankles). The Irons of Imprisonment can only be broken by a Wish spell or a blow from a plus 4 or better weapon.
    -   Dimensional Shackles are magic arm bindings that prevent the creature wearing them from using any sort of teleportation or ability to shift to another plane while they're imprisoned.
-   Pretty much the domain of White in _Magic: The Gathering_, which is the colour with the most access to arresting spells (including, of course, Arrest). Most artwork depicts Hard Light construct chains or ropes, but more regular bindings of abstract situations (like the current artwork for Arrest, which is an arresting scene) are occasionally displayed.

     Video Games  

-   On each mission of _Carmen Sandiego's Great Chase Through Time_ the detective is given a set of Time Cuffs, which in-game can only be activated by an ACME Good Guide once all three pieces of a Carmen Note is found.

-   _Fallen London:_ Lowell's Locks & Cages specializes in such bindings when they're not manufacturing similarly anomalous safes and locks. When you take personal commissions from the Masters of the Bazaar, you need to be _really_ good at what you do. The cage in the page quote can only be escaped with a judicious application of the reality-warping Red Science; you alter yourself minutely so the bars aren't around you (because the "you" they were around is technically gone), then return yourself to normal elsewhere.
-   In _League of Legends_, several playable champions have "binding" spells that magically stun enemies in place one way or another. Morgana wields "Dark Binding", a basic projectile that stuns the first enemy it hits for a few crucial seconds, while Lux uses a variant called "Light Binding", which hits up to two enemies at once for a shorter duration. Bard and his "Cosmic Bindings" first collide with an enemy then extend behind them, and if the extension runs into terrain or _another_ enemy, all affected units become stunned.

     Visual Novel  

-   On _Fate/stay night_ and _Fate/Zero_ one of Archer's Noble Phantasms is Enkidu, a special chain that was created to restrain the gods. Its strength is proportional to the divinity of his opponent, making it unbreakable when used on a god but merely exceptionally strong when used on a mortal.

     Webcomics

     Western Animation  

-   An episode of the animated _Bibi Blocksberg_ had the eponymous witch attempt to conjure a set of ropes to capture an evil wizard, but he sends her spell right back at her, leaving her wrapped up in her own ropes which, being magical, can't be untied by hand, they have to be burned off.

However, when monsters attack, Nabu easily removes the shackles so he can use his magic to help the others fight the monsters, and admits to Aisha that he could've done so at any time, but didn't do so since the Winx had bigger concerns than whether or not they could trust him.
    -   At the end of the 19th episode of the fourth season, three of the Winx get caught in a trap while trying to rescue the Specialists from Diana's warrior fairies. The chains used to bind them prevent them from using their new Sophix powers. However, once the remaining three fairies are caught, all six are able to combine their powers and break the chains.
