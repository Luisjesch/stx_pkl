Welcome to Barsoom. Better known as Mars.

_"I wanted to write about imaginary worlds. Now that our whole planet has been explored other planets are the only place you can put them."_

Stories, nominally Science Fiction, set on an alien world described in lush detail. The world can be Earth in the far distant future, or an alien planet, but it is reached by science-fictional means, not magic.

However, the science is largely handwaving. Visitors may arrive on the world by spaceship, and there might be items of Lost Technology present, but overall the world will feel like Low Fantasy — a feudal society with small-scale magic but no Big Bad — and it will share most of the same tropes. Sometimes the genre is even called "Sword and Planet", in reference to Sword and Sorcery, although other authors have this as a different if often overlapping genre. Because the "romance" in the title stems from Chivalric Romance, a Love Interest is not in fact required.

May involve Weird Science. Schizo Tech may occur. Even if the planet has futuristic transportation, expect, however irrationally, large parts of it to be unexplored, and it to be easy to be out of contact with one's home, allies, and government. Prone to use Medieval European Fantasy tropes, or feature a Feudal Future. Overlaps heavily with the Dying Earth subgenre pioneered by Jack Vance's eponymous novel. Examples set in our solar system tend to involve now-discarded hypotheses about the environments and histories of other planets, such as Venus Is Wet and Once-Green Mars.

Space Opera is a closely related genre, but the action and adventure tend to take place more in space and on differing planets. Usually it is set within the context of a galaxy-spanning civilization and involves at least some travel between planets. One distinction is that Planetary Romances are essentially Jungle Operas in space whereas Space Operas are essentially High Fantasy in space.

Contrast with Single-Biome Planet. See also Pulp Magazine, Swashbuckler, Two-Fisted Tales. The natural environment for an Alien Princess.

Not to be confused with Mars Needs Women.

-   _Trigun_: Set on a fictional planet known as No Man's Land, the plot follows Vash the Stampede, a famous gunman who is constantly fighting bounty hunters seeking to obtain the immense bounty on his head.
-   _The Vision of Escaflowne_: Though it initially appears to be fantasy, all examples of "magic" in the series turn out to be highly advanced (read: reality-altering) technology, and no wizards or sorcerers appear, only super-scientists.

    Comic Books 

-   _Astro City_:
    -   A major part of Starfighter's past adventures involve Illula, Seven-Fold Empress of Jarranatha.
    -   Also a good part of the Astro-Naut's adventures, with Xalzana the space princess.
-   _Den_: A disenchanted office worker builds a machine that opens a portal to another world where a "deposed queen" beckons him to enter another world. Turning into a muscleman on the new world, he fights several monsters.
-   _The Incredible Hulk_:
    -   The _Planet Hulk_ storyline was essentially a planetary romance.
    -   _World War Hulk_: After the Hulk returned to Earth, his son Skaar received his own title, also a planetary romance... at least until Galactus showed up to eat the planet.
    -   This wasn't the first time the Hulk had got a planetary romance; there were also his adventures in the Microverse in the 70s. The Hulk's other son, Hiro-Kala, visits the Microverse in a 2010 miniseries.
-   _The Magnificent Ms. Marvel_: The first plot arc drops Kamala into a classic _Flash Gordon_\-style planetary romance story, complete with a Raygun Gothic visual aesthetic, alien hunks with colorful skin and minimal clothing, and a whole load of Schizo Tech.
-   _Starlight_: Tantalus fits this trope in flashbacks but in modern day it's more like Earth. Most fantasy creatures were wiped out and the population have turned into Apathetic Citizens who sit in front of their TVs while a dictator rules them.
-   _Superman_:
    -   In the Silver and Bronze ages, Superman, Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes often travelled around the galaxy and visited and explored other planets, mingling with their inhabitants.
    -   _The Krypton Chronicles_ and the different _World of Krypton_ series delved deeply into Krypton's history, culture and even language.
    -   _Superman/Supergirl: Maelstrom_: One of the two main subplots has Superman and Supergirl exploring a remote, strange and dangerous planet.
    -   _The Condemned Legionnaires_: The Legion visit weird and uncanny worlds during their journey: a quarantine world where medical robots take care of people who suffer from rare diseases, a planet hidden inside a humongous cloud of dark matter inhabited by spherical, bouncy aliens, a faraway planet used as a playground by the children of a race of giants from another dimension...
    -   _Red Daughter of Krypton_: Supergirl lives adventures across the galaxy wherein visits different planets and cultures as learning about herself.
-   _The Warlord (DC)_: The Vietnam veteran and SR-71 pilot Travis Morgan passes through a hole in the Earth's crust while flying over the North Pole and lands in the underground world of Skartaris, a Lost World strongly reminiscent of Edgar Rice Burroughs' _Pellucidar_. There Travis, wielding his .44 AutoMag pistol and joined by scantily-dressed female barbarian Tara, becomes the Warlord and fights villains such as the Evil Sorcerer Deimos and various kings.
-   _Warlord of Mars_, the comic book adaption of Edgar Rice Burroughs' _John Carter of Mars_ by Dynamite Entertainment. The books were also adapted by Marvel at some point.

-   A lot of the early, world-hopping stories in _X-Men_ and _Excalibur_ are like this, usually written by Chris Claremont and/or Alan Davis, and usually centering around Nightcrawler (and sometimes Shadowcat or Wolverine).

    Comic Strips 

-   _Flash Gordon_: The planet Mongo and its various moons are as much characters as the main cast.

    Film — Animated 

-   _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_: The movie begins as a Verne-like story of exploration, but its second half leaves the modern world behind focuses on the characters' stay in the isolated cavern-kingdom of Atlantis, among ancient, crumbling and overgrown ruins as they try to study its mysterious Magitek and the remnants of its society. By the end, most of the cast returns to the surface world, but the main protagonist stays behind as the spouse of Atlantis' new queen.

    Film — Live Action 

-   _Aquaman_, while it technically takes place on modern Earth, is primarily set in the fantastical and technologically advanced five kingdoms of Atlantis at the bottom of the sea. Everything from plasma rifle\-wielding stormtroopers backed by missile-spewing hovercraft to krakens and harpoon-wielding Fish People to epic gladiator duels between kings is fair game.
-   _Avatar_ is primarily an adventure set on the alien moon Pandora and completely unapologetic about the fact that it's all about a fantasy of Magical Natives in a paradisal world.
-   _John Carter_, naturally, an adaptation of the trope-codifying novel _A Princess of Mars_.
-   _Krull_ is a campy swashbuckling adventure pitting the residents of a Standard Fantasy Setting against a Galactic Conqueror.
-   _Princess of Mars_, a Mockbuster from The Asylum, is an extremely loose Setting Update of the _John Carter of Mars_ novels, with additional elements 'borrowed' from _Avatar_.
-   _Stargate_: The original film. The subsequent television shows, however, follow the Wagon Train to the Stars format pioneered by _Star Trek: The Original Series_, exploring strange new worlds and seek out new life forms and new civilizations.
-   _Star Wars: Ewok Adventures_: While the _Star Wars_ franchise as a whole is a galaxy-spanning Space Opera, the _Adventures_ movies are instead set on the isolated, wilderness moon of Endor and focus on what are functionally fantasy adventures as the characters contend against sci-fi versions of giants, orcs, and witches.
-   _Thor: Ragnarok_ is a deliberate throwback to the genre. Much of the action takes place on Sakaar, a chaotic Landfill Beyond the Stars ruled by a mad Evil Overlord, populated by countless alien species and located at a nexus of wormholes, all constantly dumping the lost junk of the universe onto its surface. Director Taika Waititi cited the cult '80s movie Flash Gordon (1980) <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  as a major influence on _Ragnarok_.
-   _A Trip to the Moon_ follows a group of astronomers who travel to the Moon in a cannon-propelled capsule, explore the Moon's surface, escape from an underground group of Selenites (lunar inhabitants), and return to Earth with a captive Selenite.

    Literature 

-   _The Adventures of Tom Rynosseros_, featuring a sandship captain in a far future Australia, now reclaimed by the Aboriginal nations.
-   _Big Planet_: The objective of the mission from Earth to Big Planet was to ensure that the whole world didn't fall under the domination of the tyrant Lysidder. But when the mission spacecraft crash-lands, the survivors are faced with a 40,000 mile trek across the vast and unknown surface of the planet.
-   _The Book Of Ptath_ by A.E. van Vogt: The god Ptath is flung into the far future by a deadly rival and given the mind of a 20th century man. Stranded in this alien world, he must fight to regain his powers before the rival goddess sends the world spinning into chaos and darkness.
-   The _Bunduki_ series by J.T. Edson. James Allenvale 'Bunduki' Gunn and his cousin Dawn Drummond-Clayton should have been killed when their Land Rover plunged into the Gambuti Gorge. Instead, Bunduki woke to find himself in a primeval jungle and armed with primitive weapons. Dawn came to her senses on a game-haunted plain. Guided by subconscious suggestion, they set out to find each other. To do so, they had to transverse terrain populated by many kinds of wild animals and savage people. Before they were reunited, both had to face danger and death many times.
-   _Coyote_ by Allen Steele (though it's technically a moon, not a planet. Lunar romance?). Set several decades in the future, _Coyote_ presents a United States that has become an oppressive, dystopian nation. Its leaders decide to send colonists to a potentially habitable moon orbiting 47 Ursae Majoris, 46 light-years away. But just before the launch of the ship, a group of dissidents steal the ship and replace its crew, bent on starting a new life far out in space.
-   _The Darkangel Trilogy_ is set in the distant future, when the Moon has long since been terraformed into a lush paradise complete with its own animals, plants, and races.
-   _The Diadem Saga_ by Jo Clayton. Aleytys adventures from planet to planet throughout a galaxy equally inhabited by elemental spirits, Insectoid Aliens, rogue psychics, hostile natives, corrupt megacorporations, and Transplanted Humans of every kind.
-   _Darkover_, by Marion Zimmer Bradley: Although nominally Science Fiction, any of the novels set before the rediscovery are indistinguishable from fantasy.
-   _Dragonriders of Pern_ features dragons on an alien world. At the beginning of the series a prologue introduces the sci-fi aspects, but it is not until much later in the story that they become more apparent. Most novels remain firmly set in the medieval-level society that emerged after the original colony collapsed.
-   _Dune_ by Frank Herbert. The book, while perfectly serviceable as a straight example, is actually a Deconstructor Fleet of the genre's conventions. David Lynch's Film of the Book plays the tropes much straighter.
-   The _Dying Earth_ series by Jack Vance is set in the distant future, at a point when the sun is almost exhausted and magic has asserted itself as a dominant force and has, for the most part, displaced science.
-   _Gor_: Gor is a Counter-Earth linearly opposed to the sun (essentially hidden by the sun) even while sharing the same orbit as earth. The planet of Gor is populated with cultures not unlike those of the Roman, Viking Greek and even native American, this presence of Earth-like cultures explained by the occasional transplantation of entire population groups from Earth to Gor.
-   _Helliconia_ is an epic chronicling the rise and fall of a civilisation over more than a thousand years as the planet progresses through its incredibly long seasons, which last for centuries.
-   _That Irresistible Poison_: Set on the planet Calluvia, where the inhabitants are telepaths. This is an LGBT-friendly society, where same-sex couples are common and accepted. We see many technologies on Calluvia, such as transporters, holograms, genetically modified babies, and artificial wombs for same-sex parents. Even their telepathic abilities have neurobiological explanations.
-   _Planet of Adventure_ by Jack Vance, featuring the adventures of Adam Reith, a spacer from Earth, who crash-lands on the newly discovered planet Tschai. Tschai is inhabited by four alien species.

-   _John Carter of Mars_: One of the genre's definers. Mars is depicted as having loads and loads of alien races and strange life-forms (with a very cheerful disregard for any sort of biological plausibility—Red Martians are fully human-like in appearance, including having beautiful princesses, who lay eggs but are nonetheless fully capable of interbreeding with Earthmen) and swords co-exist with "radium pistols" and flying machines. The planet is divided into many independent kingdoms and city-states, along with mysterious enclaves of beings with ancient super-science. The entire setting serves as the arena for swashbuckling heroes to have exotic adventures (and woo the aforementioned beautiful egg-laying princesses).

-   Ursula K. Le Guin's SF novels tend to steer this way: _The Left Hand of Darkness_, _Rocannon's World_, etc. At least in the sense of having the planets be a pseudo-feudal setting — she generally avoids the more magical elements.
-   _The Last Guardian (2001)_ while being a religious story, utterly glories in the alien world of Noron, the people and culture, the dinosaurs.
-   _The Lords of Creation_ series by S. M. Stirling is set in a present day Alternate History where Mars and Venus, thanks to the intervention of Ancient Astronauts, are similar to the worlds portrayed in Edgar Rice Burroughs' novels.
-   _Lumbanico The Cubic Planet_: The setting is a bizarrely-shaped alien planet, located very far away from Earth, with their own different cultures and societies, each featuring their own calendars and set of beliefs, and a complex history that stretches back several centuries.

-   Leigh Brackett's Mars, Venus, and Skaith series (often featuring the recurring character Eric John Stark), which are essentially Low Fantasy Darker and Edgier versions of Burrough's series.
-   The _Novels of the Jaran_ start this way, but become more sci-fi as the series progresses.
-   _Old Mars_ and _Old Venus_ are two anthologies edited by George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois homaging old planetary romance stories set on Mars and Venus.
-   Mary Gentle's _Orthe_ series. Slightly different in that Orthe is an alien world, populated by a race who apparently destroyed the high-tech and highly advanced race who once ruled it, and deliberately regressed to a much less technologically advanced state.
-   In Mark Hodder's _A Red Sun Also Rises_, a doubting priest and his hunchbacked sexton are taken by a tribe of cannibals and transported to an alien world which starts their adventure.
-   Most of _The Space Trilogy_ by C. S. Lewis, including _Out of the Silent Planet_ (set on Mars) and _Perelandra_ (set on Venus) but not _That Hideous Strength_, which takes place on Earth.
-   Ray Cummings' _Tama of the Light Country_ is a surprisingly feminist work for 1930. It also zilches the one-culture-per-planet rule. Earthman Guy Palisse lands on Mercury in an experimental rocket. His friend Tama is a very young woman who leads a revolt of "winged virgins" and male allies against a long-established law that women must have their wings amputated (sans anesthesia) upon marriage.
-   _Terminal World_ by Alastair Reynolds, is set in the far future on a planet hinted to be a terraformed Mars.

-   L. Sprague de Camp's _Viagens Interplanetarias_ series is an attempt to do a semi-Hard SF version of Burroughs.

-   Terry Dowling's _Wormwood_, a compilation of short stories taking place on a future Earth, which explore the place of humans in a world long since conquered by — and modified to suit the needs (whims?) of — a technologically-superior alien race, as well as several client species.
-   _Radiance_ is a combined homage to this subgenre and to the roughly-coincident Golden Age of Hollywood, set in a solar system in which all worlds are inherently hospitable to Earth-like life and colonised by humans.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_: Some stories fit this genre, particularly in the early years when the show was more heavily influenced by Burroughs-like fiction:
    -   "The Daleks": The crew land on the post-apocalyptic jungle planet Skaro, and go to explore the gleaming city in the distance to find a vital component for the TARDIS. They accidentally spark war between the Noble Savage Thal race, and the Little Green Man in a Can Dalek race, and lead the Thals into the Dalek city to attack them for good and get the TARDIS back.
    -   "The Keys of Marinus", written by the same writer as "The Daleks": The crew land on the planet Marinus, with seas of acid and strange hostile aliens called the Voord. An old man blocks off the TARDIS and tasks them as heroes destined to return four Keys, which they have to explore four different areas of the world to retrieve. There's a Lotus-Eater Machine city, an ice city, a jungle, and a Kangaroo Court culture...
    -   "The Web Planet": The TARDIS is ensnared in a web and when Ian and the Doctor leave to investigate, Barbara becomes possessed and the TARDIS console is stolen, seemingly by giant ant creatures the Zarbi under the instructions of their Queen. The Menoptera save Barbara and befriend the rest of the crew, and they set off on a journey exploring their planet, encountering various different kinds of insect people, and battling the Animus (a sinister Plant Alien that has taken control of the Zarbi). Has lots of very dreamlike imagery such as the Menoptera flying in space through an Alien Sky, the surreal sounds made by the Zarbi and their larva that they use as weapons.

    Podcasts 

-   The _Artifexian Podcast_ features regular worldbuilding segments set in a solar system where the three inhabited planets are based on different worldbuilding paradigms, one of them being a planetary romance. It has .6 earth gravity, meaning that humans who grow up there are much taller, humans who reach there from other worlds are comparatively far stronger, and airship technology is much easier to develop with pre-industrial technology.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Blue Planet_ from Fantasy Flight Games is set on the water world of Poseidon and exploring it and surviving its inherent dangers are major parts of most campaigns. As a twist to its obvious "new colony" setting it's actually inhabited by Sufficiently Advanced Aliens.
-   _d20 Modern_: "The Iron Lords of Jupiter" setting posits that, beneath Jupiter's cloud cover, the planet is solid just like Earth and home to hundreds of alien cultures with Iron Age-level technology, and the player characters are either natives or stranded humans. The reason for Jupiter having the same force of gravity as Earth is left as an exercise for the game-master.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: The _Dark Sun_ setting has a fair bit of this flavour, with its Dying Earth Subgenre\-inspired desert setting, emphasis on psionics over conventional magic, and preference for weird, alien-seeming monsters over the more iconic _D&D_ creatures. This was also the setting most commonly associated with the mantis-like thri-keen race, whose four arms were a common feature of the _John Carter of Mars_ series.

-   _GURPS Settings_: _Planet Krishna_ adapts L. Sprague de Camp's _Viagens Interplanetarias_ series, and _GURPS Planet of Adventure_ is based on Jack Vance's _Planet of Adventure_ series.
-   _Numenera_: Many of the worlds presented in _Into the Night_ are intended as inspirations for this sort of storytelling. Travel to these worlds is difficult, and can happen just as easily as a result of being flung halfway across the galaxy by ancient Precursor tech as by deliberate starship travel. As a result even simply returning to Earth can take most of a campaign and the story is assumed to focus on exploring a new and alien environment, with its own bizarre native dangers and societies. Notable examples include the dying world of Naharrai, once known as Mars, which was terraformed in the ancient past but now grows drier and colder every year; Urvanas, once called Venus, where a society of humans and aliens inhabits ancient, self-replicating floating cities whose origins none now recall; Perelande, where societies of aliens and machines descended from ancient castaways live on a calcareous crust that covers a global ocean; Xeobrencus, a sunless ocean world home to strange aquatic beings; the Swarmstar, where a human culture lives among the vine-like filaments hanging from creatures that swarm around an alien sun; and the Gloaming, an Alderson disk home to a scattered confederation of alien cultures amides worlds' worth of wilderness. In most of these cases, the societies of the alien worlds are similar to the Ninth World Earth's in being largely medieval, with only scattered access to ancient fragments of advanced technology.
-   _Pathfinder_:
    -   The setting is set up to facilitate this. The elves are actually of alien descent, and their ancient portals to other planets still exist. Some creatures such as nightgaunts can fly through space. Spells which allow this kind of travel are listed. The _Distant Worlds_ sourcebook exists to flesh out the rest of the solar system as well, which generally consists of a mix of earlier ideas of the solar system mixed with eldritch horror. Aballon (Mercury) is a sun-baked world inhabited by robots with scattered habitable ice caverns, Castrovel (Venus) is a jungle with dinosaur-riding amazons and is the homeworld of the elves, Akiton (Mars) is a dying world covered in ancient ruins and is home to expies of Green and Red Martians and a colony of Elder Things, and so on. The outer planets are even stranger, such as Tidally Locked Planet Verces, Triaxus and its generations-long seasons, and Nightmare Fuel incarnate Aucturn.
    -   _Starfinder_ promotes the setting to a full Space Opera, as it takes place centuries later and involves more advanced technology and frequent space travel.

-   _Space 1889_ is Victorian colonial adventures on carefully described planets with a heavy dose of Steampunk. Unlike most planetary romances, the science (particularly the one which is based on different natural laws and thus doesn't really work in our world) is carefully described.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_ is ambiguous at first when there is only a single island, then becomes a clear example as an underground alien civilization is uncovered (actually the body of a downed Humongous Mecha). A new planet that's later introduced is an archetypal example of this trope.
-   _Masters of the Universe_, mostly in the early minicomics where Eternia was an Scavenger World.

    Video Games 

-   _Albion_ kicks off with the heroes crash landing on a planet. They first arrive in an alien world inhabited by cat people who use magic and Organic Technology, but later regions accessed in the game could easily look like medieval Europe, complete with Celts as inhabitants who worship ancient Veltic deities.
-   _Dark Scavenger_ describes the species and cultures of the world in detail.

-   _Final Fantasy_: While the individual games are mostly just High Fantasy, the franchise as a whole indicates that it is this via its Canon Welding. It has been established that all of the worlds of _Final Fantasy_ are part of a shared multiverse separated by a nothingness called the Void, something that occasionally spawns (or defeats) villains and can be crossed by characters with sufficient magical or technological means. Space travel between the worlds is theoretically possible and has happened once or twice, or has been part of villains' plots (e.g. Sephiroth's plan to use the Planet as a spaceship to find another planet in _Advent Children_). _Final Fantasy V_ in particular involves travel between different planets via meteorites.
-   _Horizon Zero Dawn_ is an example of this trope set on post-apocalyptic Earth, where a Feudal Future society of Nordic- and Celtic-inspired clans battle enormous robot dinosaurs and each other.

-   _Journey to the Savage Planet_ is all about exploring a, well, savage planet, fighting the wild animals left after the local Precursors vanished aeons ago.

-   _Oddworld_ is set on the titular planet of Oddworld. Oddworld is an exotic planet populated by many bizarre alien species, each with their own unique culture. It is a Dystopian story about the environmental destruction of the planet caused by industrialized species and the effects that out-of-control business excesses with no morals have on the more vulnerable races. There's plenty of Slave Races and Last of His Kind to go around with a heavy Green Aesop.
-   _Star Fox Adventures_, in contrast to the other games in the series, takes place on a singular planet inhabited by sentient dinosaurs, and relatively few straight sci-fi elements. It does have satellital areas (previously separated from the planet) that stand in for offworld destinations, however.

-   _Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order_ has elements of this. Although multiple planets are visited, the focus is on the Zeffo and their long-dead civilization.

    Western Animation 

-   _Fantastic Planet_ (_La Planète sauvage_), the bizarre, surreal French animated film.
