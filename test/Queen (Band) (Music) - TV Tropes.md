Queen is a famous British rock band known for their style which combines hard rock, massed vocal harmonies, Brian May's intricately arranged and highly overdubbed guitar work, catchy pop melodies, surreal humour and flamboyant, theatrical performances (which the band was steered towards mainly by Mercury).

The band was formed in 1970 with front-man Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara), guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor, evolving from the ashes of an earlier band called Smile, which featured Brian and Roger and was fronted by a fellow called Tim Staffell. Freddie, a friend of all three, was also the band's biggest fan who jumped at the opportunity to fill the vacancy left by Staffell's departure, choosing a new name for the band for good measure. After going through a series of short-term bassists, they finally settled with John Deacon in 1971.

All members of the band were songwriters, approaching wildly different styles, from straight-up Hard Rock and Arena Rock to Glam Rock, Progressive Rock, Heavy Metal, Disco / Funk, pop, rockabilly, New Wave and Synth-Pop.

The band is often thought to have broken up after Mercury's 1991 death from complications of AIDS. While that isn't quite true, the band chose not to replace Mercury and stopped virtually all activity besides a posthumous album with Mercury's previously recorded vocals in 1995 and one single in 1997. Deacon officially retired from the band soon afterward.

May and Taylor have continued to record and tour in collaboration with other musicians under the "Queen + ..." moniker, which resulted in one album, _The Cosmos Rocks_ with Paul Rodgers of Free and Bad Company fame as singer. The album was greeted with critical disdain and a fan backlash over the perceived nature of Rodgers as a poor substitute, despite May and Taylor repeatedly pointing out that he was only a featured artist and not a replacement for Mercury. Rodgers and the band went their separate ways in 2009, and subsequently, the group performed with former _American Idol_ contestant Adam Lambert in 2011, and continues to do so to this day.

The group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, as well as the Songwriters Hall of Fame and UK Music Hall of Fame a few years later.

In 2017, after years of speculation, a biopic entitled _Bohemian Rhapsody_ was announced, directed by Bryan Singer and starring Rami Malek as Freddie, Gwilym Lee as Brian, Ben Hardy as Roger, and Joseph Mazzello as John, which was released on October 24, 2018, in the UK and November 2, 2018, in the US. It received 5 Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor (Rami Malek) and Best Picture, and won them all except Best Picture.
