Flowers signifying sexual orientation is an extension of flowers signifying love, as the practice sprouts from Flowers of Romance and other floral symbolism. The most notable flowers signifying homosexuality are violets for lesbians and lavender for homosexuality in general.

This convention has its origins in the work of the Greek poet Sappho, widely considered the most famous historical lesbian, her name and homeland giving us the terms _sapphic_ and _lesbian._

Generally speaking, colors in the West that have long been symbols of decadence have been co-opted by historical homosexuals to express their sexuality.

This trope may be expressed through potential lovers giving actual flowers to their lover, but it can also be symbolic. That is, a character could be (1) nicknamed Violet or Lily (or variants such as Viola or Liana, etc.), (2) frequently seen near lavender or violets (etc.), or (3) exceptionally fond of wearing the colors associated with those flowers (e.g. purple, lavender, green). That said, this trope often emphasizes homosexuality or queerness. Thus, Ho Yay may be made actual subtext with this symbolism, but merely the presence of these symbols does not constitute the subtext. Merely being named Violet, for example, does not mean the character is LGBT, and thus would not be an example of this trope without more context.

Subtrope of Flower Motifs and Homoerotic Subtext. A sister trope to Something about a Rose and Fleur-de-lis, which concern roses and lilies respectively when they don't symbolize homosexuality. Can be expressed through Flowers of Romance, Garden of Love, Floral Theme Naming, Flowers of Femininity, and Hanahaki Disease. Compare Four-Leaf Clover as a luck symbol. See also The Poppy, which is worn in remembrance for the dead of World War I.

## Lavender for Homosexuality

_"I should like you all to know,_

_I'm a famous gigolo,_

_And of lavender, my nature's got just a dash of it._

_As I'm slightly undersexed_

_You will always find me next_

_To some dowager who's wealthy rather than passionate."_

In the West, purple has been associated with royalty since the time of the Romans. From this association, the color became associated with decadence, and it is from this connotation that the color has a connection to homosexuality. Namely, during the time of the Industrial Revolution, the arts were associated with decadence, and the men interested in the arts were viewed as unmanly. The decadent purple was replaced by the paler lavender to symbolize the unmanly interests of the time, and it is a short step from this connection with effeminate men to a connotation of homosexuality.

When the lesbian community used violets as a symbol of pride in the 1920s, they also used lavender to express their protest. It wasn't until the 1950s that the flower, and the color, became firmly associated with the LGBT community at large, only to be replaced by the pink triangle as the most popular symbol for gay pride.

Nowadays, "lavender" is used to directly associate something with homosexuality, such as "lavender linguistics," for the socio-linguistics of the LGBT community, or "lavender graduation," for an LGBT-specific graduation ceremony. The term "lavender revolution" is even synonymous with the gay rights movement.

## Violets for Lesbianism

_"Rejoice, go and_

_remember me. For you know how we cherished you._

_But if not, I want_

_to remind you_

_\[...\] and beautiful times we had._

_For many crowns of violets_

_and roses_

_\[...\] at my side you put on"_

— Sappho, Fragment 94, as translated by Anne Carson

Common violets (_Viola sororia_) are often associated with lesbians and romantic love between women. This symbol originates from Sappho, who may have used violets frequently in her love poems to women. The scientific name, _sororia_, derives from the Latin _soror,_ for sister (more here).

The symbol of violets for lesbianism was popularized by the 1926 French play _La Prisonniere_ ("The Captive"), in which a lesbian expresses her love for another woman by leaving nosegays of violets for her. After police shut down the Broadway run of the play, marching onstage in the middle of a performance to arrest the two leads, lesbians and bisexual women began wearing violets in protest.

## Lilies for Lesbianism

Within the Yuri Genre, lilies symbolize romance between two women. In fact, the word "yuri" (ゆり) translates to "lilies" in English. The term, and therefore the symbol, originates from a 1976 magazine article titled "Yuri." A notable difference between the use of, say, violets and lilies is that "yuri" as a term for lesbianism is a "softer" term than the literal translation of "lesbian" ("lezu") and connotes romance rather than lust.

That said, lilies in Japan symbolize more than one thing, much like roses symbolize different things in English-speaking countries depending on the color and context of the gift. In general, the white lily symbolizes chastity and purity, hence why it might be a softer term for lesbianism.

## Green Carnations for Gay Men

The green carnation began as a symbol for Oscar Wilde and his followers. In 1892, he had one of the actors in _Lady Windermere's Fan_ wear a green carnation on opening night, and many of his younger followers wore them as well. There even was a parody of Wilde published in 1894 titled _The Green Carnation_. It is likely that Wilde chose a _green_ carnation because of his belief that nature ought to imitate art, and not the reverse. Since a _green_ carnation does not come from nature, it embodies the unnatural. This is how the flower implies homosexuality, though Wilde never made such a direct admission.

## Roses for Gay Men

The Bara Genre owes its name to the Japanese word for rose, "bara" (ばら). As a symbol for gay men, the rose became popularized by the publication of _Barazoku_ in the early 1970s. However, the idea for the symbol originates in Greek Mythology, specifically deriving from myths of King Laius having affairs with boys under rose trees. "Barazoku" means "rose tribe" and is a slang term for homosexual men, much like how "yurizoku" or "yuri" ("lily tribe" or "lily") is for lesbians.

That said, roses in the West symbolize many things depending on the color and placement of the flower. In general, a rose symbolizes romance, and it should be noted that examples of roses symbolizing anything other than homosexuality are better suited for Something about a Rose.

## The Trillium<small>◊</small> Flower for Bisexuality

Since 2001, the Mexican bisexual flag<small>◊</small> uses the trillium flower as its symbol, and Michael Page, in 1999, suggested using it for this purpose as well. This flower belongs to the same family as the lily, and scientists first used the word "bisexual" in reference to these flowers — what with their having both male and female sex organs.

-   _Maiden Rose_:
    -   Taki and Klaus are a gay couple and their relationship is full of flower symbolism. One of which is the rose.
    -   The symbol of Taki's division is a three-leaf rose. Taki is also the current shinka, or "flower of the Emporer," and is therefore the titular "maiden rose" represented in his family crest and his military division. Moreover, Taki is mysteriously followed by the scent of flowers.
    -   Klaus's family has traditionally gardened roses for generations, and the men of his family feel a calling for a "flower," without which they are incomplete. However, none of the men have found this "flower" due to a broken promise. Klaus outright states that he has given up everything in pursuit of Taki specifically because Taki _is_ the "flower" of his family myth.
-   The English title of _Kiss and White Lily for My Dearest Girl_ is "_A Kiss and a White Lily for Her_" and white lilies are featured prominently. Meanwhile, Yukina and Towako's arc focuses on red roses rather than lilies, unlike all the other lesbian couples in the story.

For Rose's part, she was vehemently against Mindy being her next victim, even before she realized it was lethal.
-   In _Violet & Daisy_, the titular characters' relationship is that of a couple rather than merely a murderous partnership. While they're platonic, it may be a hint that one or both feels (or could feel) something more.
-   In _Hot Fuzz_, the relevant lines and peace lily plotline originally meant for a cut female love interest were given to Danny. At the beginning of the film, Nicholas's ex-girlfriend complains he's Married to the Job and he'll someday find someone to open up to.

For the characters teasing him, the surprising part of this admission is not that he has affection for Stocke but rather that he actually said it aloud.
-   In _GrimGrimoire_, Amoretta's first meeting with Lillet seems to show her developing a "girl crush" on the heroine, even saying "I like your smile. Can I touch it?" with Lillet nervously letting her do so. It's explicitly established that Amoretta, her name meaning "little love," only lives because Lillet's love sustains her. Near the end game, they sort of wind up together, and they actually live together in the post-game epilogue.

    Web Animation 

-   RWBY: This show is heavily inspired by anime and uses a lot of anime techniques and tropes. This includes using lilies as symbols of "yuri" (girl-on-girl love).

    Web Comics 

-   Rose of _Homestuck_:

When he tells Charlie he loves him, he's surrounded by leaves. The artist often uses scattered flowers or leaves as decorations throughout the series, but they're especially prominent at these moments.

    Real Life 

-   _Vampires & Violets: Lesbians in Film_ by Andrea Weiss discusses how violets have been used in cinema to represent lesbianism.
-   In Japanese since at least the 1970s, "barazoku" and "yurizoku" have been used to refer to gay men and women respectively, with "yuri" being less offensive than the more literal term for lesbian ("lezu").
-   In the 1920s, "violet" was an American slang term used to refer to gay people, but especially so lesbians.
-   The Mexican bisexual flag uses a purple trillium flower over a white field surrounded on either side by pink and blue fields.
-   The use of the word lavender as an adjective typically denotes something related to LGBT culture or groups. Specific examples would include the "lavender revolution," which was synonymous with the gay rights movement, and "lavender linguistics," which is the branch of socio-linguistics that looks at how LGBT groups speak.
-   To refer to someone having a "dash of lavender" or "streak of lavender" is to say that they are gay.
-   The Lavender Scare, an extension of the Red Scare. McCarthy and his followers led a witch hunt to expel all LGBT people from the United States government under the pretense that they were more vulnerable to blackmail from communist infiltrators. It didn't occur to any of them that their targets wouldn't be vulnerable to blackmail if laws at the time didn't force them to keep their sexuality a secret in the first place. Also their vulnerability in this regard was overstated, the Soviet Union was just as bad in terms of queer rights. Of the Communist countries at the time, only East Germany and Vietnam had legalized homosexuality. Both countries also included at least some protections for trans people. Homosexuality was also technically legal in China as a result of having never been made illegal, but the Chinese Communist Party took a rather dim view of it and did very little to protect LGBT people.
-   The Lavender Panthers, a group active in San Francisco from 1973 to 1974. Reverend Raymond Broshears was tired of police being useless when it came to Homophobic Hate Crimes, so he founded an armed vigilante group that patrolled the streets at night with the aim of stopping hate crimes in the process.
