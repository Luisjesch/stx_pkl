_"I think it just goes to show that being easy is pretty much_ all upside."

Many virgins will testify that being a virgin "sucks". Another thing that sucks is a vacuum. It is therefore no coincidence that, much like a vacuum, nature abhors a virgin. Any time a character's virginity is mentioned in the course of a plot as being a negative attribute, we can rest assured that by the end of the story the character will "get over it", and get laid. The negative attribute in question is defined very broadly. It can simply mean that they lack self-confidence, experience with women, or that they just aren't real men. If the virginity is necessary for a character to be made into a ritual sacrifice (and thus, losing it renders her unable to _be_ sacrificed), that counts, too. This trope could also apply in a work in which someone says that sexual abstinence may be unhealthy and unnatural.

This trope does _not_ apply when the virginity is a positive attribute that must be protected. That is the province of Virgin Power. However, in those works, it is not unknown for The Casanova or other seducers to argue for this trope.

Due to the controversial nature of this trope, let it be simply stated that, at a societal level, constant reproduction (at least to the extent of replacing an aging population) is necessary for evolution. That said, being a virgin (at any age) does not make you any less of a man/woman/person of non-binary gender/small furry creature from Alpha Centauri than anyone else.

This trope can be used to head off a Virgin Sacrifice. The inversion of Virgin Tension. Compare You Need to Get Laid. Not to be confused with Nature Adores a Virgin, but that trope might help explain why this trope happens, depending on the work. See also Quest for Sex and Sex as Rite-of-Passage.

## Examples

    open/close all folders 

    Apparel 

-   There are T-shirts that read "Cure Virginity", "Help Find A Cure For Virginity" and "Virginity Is Curable".

    Anime & Manga 

-   Miyabi Serizawa from Domestic Girlfriend is driven in large part due to anxiety over still being a virgin while in college. She essentially considers her virginity to be a mark of shame and spends the manga trying to lose it.

    Comic Books 

-   Tim Drake makes an interesting case, prior to Flashpoint in _Robin_ and _Red Robin_, Tim was a virgin and happy that way. He turned down his first girlfriend's proposition for sex and the closest he came to sex was when he was nearly raped and murdered by Ra's al Ghul's sister. His New 52 counterpart on the other hand lost his virginity when Trigon possessed him and then used his body to rape Solstice and Wonder Girl (and Tim obviously) and then everyone involved decided they'd enjoyed being raped and Tim and WG started dating. His more sane pre-Flashpoint counterpart made a reappearance in Convergence where he and his long time girlfriend Stephanie Brown decided to have sex, only for their injuries to make it impractical so they just cuddled instead.

    Film 

-   _The 40-Year-Old Virgin_. Once the main character meets his Love Interest, the rest of the film ends up building up his losing his virginity. Unusually for this trope, this involves him getting married right before it happens, technically making it a subversion.
-   Downplayed in _The Flash (2023)_ when accidental contact with Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth makes Barry Allen say that he knows about sex but has never actually experienced it (Batman is also tied up in the Lasso, so at least Barry's not alone in his embarrassment). After meeting an Alternate Self who's dating his childhood crush Iris West, Barry finally summons up the courage at the end of the movie to accept Iris's suggestion that they go out on a date.
-   _Once Bitten_ opens up with the main character and his girlfriend stalling on whether or not they should have sex. His hand is forced, so to speak, once the vampires show up, and the head vampire can only drink the blood of virgins.
-   In _Scream (1996)_, Sidney Prescott had to lose her virginity in order to be a possible victim of the serial killer.
-   _Hocus Pocus_ is a subversion. The male lead is the virgin needed for the spell, and he doesn't have sex before the end of the show, probably because he's about 15 and it's a Disney movie. He does, however, get a girlfriend.
-   In the _James Bond_ film _Live and Let Die_ the tarot reader Solitaire only keeps her predictive powers for as long as she remains a virgin. Big Bad Kananga makes it clear that it's up to him how long she gets to keep her powers, and when the time comes he will take care of them personally. Too bad for him that Bond got there first... In the end, it's revealed that this was a lie the whole time. She just claimed that to avoid the fate of being taken advantage of by Kananga.
-   In a possible subversion, The Sorceress in _The Scorpion King_ is kept as a virgin by the evil Prince so as to retain her predictive powers. After our hero rescues her and they get together, he asks her whether this means that her powers have disappeared. She tells him that virginity has no effect on her powers, but "Can you think of a better legend for my ancestors to have started in order to protect all of us?"
-   In the affectionate comic take on _Dragnet_ in 1987, a character is always referred to as "the virgin Connie Swail" — until the very end of the movie, when she's just "Connie Swail." For bonus points, she spent her evening with Friday, who, it is implied, was a virgin also:
    
    **Pep Streebeck**: Oh Joe, you never had these feelings before, have you?  
    **Joe Friday**: Almost. I had a kitten once.  
    **Pep Streebeck**: Yeah, it's going to be a little different. Connie is not going to be sleeping in a box, or meowing all night, or clawing up your drapes. Or maybe she will. I mean, you're both kind of starting from scratch with this.
    
-   In _Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment_, gun nut Tackleberry tries to hint to his friend Mahoney that he is still a virgin. Mahoney keeps failing to take the hint resulting in Tackleberry telling him directly a bit louder than he'd intended. This stuns everyone nearby into an awkward silence. Tackleberry is able to score with a fellow officer he develops an interest in, who is also a gun nut.
-   _The Lair of the White Worm_ presents an Eldritch Abomination who needs the blood of a virgin in order to rise once again. While the virgin in question and the main characters don't seem to care too much, the Lesbian Vampire antagonist mocks the idea of virginity.
-   _Angel, Angel, Down We Go_ has a rare female example. Tara is dismayed that she's still a virgin at eighteen, thinking she's so fat no one will ever want her. Of course, Bogie doesn't leave her in that state for long.

    Literature 

-   In S. M. Stirling's _The Peshawar Lancers_, the psychic Central Asian/Russian young woman has to be a virgin to keep having psychic clairvoyant powers (which also cause her distress). At the end, the hero relieves her of her psychic powers, to save her. Bet you're surprised.
-   _The Bell Jar_, non-stop. Esther feels very much imprisoned by her own virginity: In The '50s, men expected women to be pure for them, though men were allowed to sleep around. If Esther wants to be married some day, she absolutely can not have sex; she'll be deemed a slut and undesirable.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Angel_: In Gwen's third appearance, Gunn realizes that, because of her powers, she's never had sex. After they steal LISA (an experimental biometric control system), he's kind enough to help her with this.
-   Averted in _Babylon 5_ - Marcus Cole is a virgin to the end.
-   Played with and eventually averted in the British sitcom _Drop the Dead Donkey_. In one episode of that series we discover middle aged Gus Hedges (a Pointy-Haired Boss) is a virgin. Eventually he is set up with a prostitute by one of his employees, but has such an attack of nerves he _faints_ before they go through with it (she lies and tells him he fainted with pleasure while they were having sex).
-   _The Mighty Boosh_: Howard is outed as a virgin at his "32nd" birthday. He's also never kissed by this time, or even held hands. He does get kissed by his friend Vince in order to pretend that they were a couple to fool an angry shaman, and after dealing with the awkwardness that followed, he's seen leaving with a woman, but it is unclear if he ends up getting laid or not.
-   Played with in _Degrassi: School's Out_. Joey loses his virginity, but Snake doesn't.
    -   _Degrassi_ plays with this. Not every time someone's virginity is brought up does it lead to sex, but every time someone's first time is included in the episode it is an issue for plot. This doesn't include all the people that we assume have sex, but the exact setting for it is never shown.
    -   The best example of subverting this is Power Squad captain Holly J thinking she's the only virgin on the squad. She immediately looks for a man to just pop one off. After being rejected, she later finds out she wasn't the only virgin, which makes her more upset realizing what she tried to do. She decides it isn't worth it, and waits for love.
-   An episode of _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_ had Carlton being mocked by Will and his friends for being a virgin. Halfway through the episode he finally gets laid, and of course, a big deal is made of it, only for it to turn out that the woman he slept with was already married. This leads us to An Aesop about how it's okay to wait for the right person.
-   Subverted frequently in the early seasons of _Married... with Children_. Bud is desperate to lose his virginity, but since it's his defining trait (after the first season or so) his attempts to get a girl always go awry, usually at the last second. Bizarrely, several episodes end with Bud actually getting the girl only for him to be a virgin again the next episode (of course, you don't _see_ anything, but evidence gets pretty conclusive). Eventually, Bud does end up having sex that sticks, and he goes from the guy who just can't get laid to the guy who just can't get laid _again._
-   _Supernatural_
    -   Several times, virgins are the exact thing needed for spells and summonings. Of course, bad things happen to everyone, including an Ethical Slut protagonist. Virgins are specifically lampshaded, though.
    -   Subverted in an episode where a virgin sacrifice could get everyone out of the situation. A religious virgin woman is willing, but the Winchester brothers refuse. At one point she quips, "If I get out of this alive I'm going to have so much sex", but what actually happens is that she's murdered along with everyone else after the brothers leave.
    -   When Dean finds out that Castiel is a virgin, he makes it a mission to help him lose it, as it could be their last night alive. He doesn't lose it (though he does die). However, when he falls in season 9, he quickly loses his virginity (without any help from Dean).
-   In _Glee_, Will finds out Emma is still a virgin. They then break up.
    -   Subverted with Kurt, who in episode 2x15 is established as not only a virgin, but a virgin who feels that he's not ready to have sex yet (or even think about it in too much detail). This situation is not only unchanged at the end of the episode, but validated, as his father reassures him that it's perfectly okay to feel that way. The subversion continues into later episodes, since in 2x16 Kurt gets a boyfriend with whom he shares some enthusiastic kissing, but by the end of the season there is still no indication that the two of them have had sex, or are even planning to in the near future.
        -   Later revealed that they haven't but in the fifth episode of season 3 they decide to lose their virginity to each other after much discussion in an episode appropriately titled "The First Time".
    -   Also subverted in a different way with Tina, who casually discards her virginity in company with Mike Chang off-screen at some point before episode 2.19 (at which point she is able to refute 'that' rumour about Asian men) without a single complaint about or even mention of her virgin status before that.
        -   Later revealed she didn't lose her virginity then but between season 2 and season 3 over the summer, intercourse isn't the only cause to see your boyfriend nude.
    -   Ultimately played straight as pretty much none of the main cast keep their virginity.
-   _The Secret Life of the American Teenager_ is made of this trope. For example, one of the first scenes in the first episode is a guy lamenting about being a virgin at the tender age of 15 and he is eagerly looking to lose it.
-   _SLiDE_ plays this absolutely straight. Ed's virginity and his desire to lose it is a big part of the pilot episode. He does have sex for the first time by the end of the second episode, and by the end of the fourth has been laid as many or more times than any other character.
-   In _Grey's Anatomy_: Halfway through season seven, it's revealed that April is a virgin, though she (being very religious) gets very upset and ashamed when she is no longer one in season 8, which causes her to fail her medical board exams.
-   The B-Plot of the _Firefly_ episode, "Jaynestown" ...sort of. Inara is hired by Magistrate Higgins to deflower his 26-year-old son. Fess is ashamed of being a virgin because he buys into his father's attitude that it makes him "not yet a man." Part of Inara's "service" to Fess is teaching him that virginity is nothing to be ashamed of, and losing it won't make him an adult. The B-plot ends with Fess being inspired to achieve something, (a nice uplifting bit to ease the depressing way the A-plot ended).
-   Played with on _Some Girls_. Saz desperately wants to lose her virginity because she feels she's the only virgin left in their year. Holli and Viva comfort her by revealing that they too are virgins and in no rush to lose it, and along with Amber, help Saz hook up with her crush. Later episodes do not mention if Saz ever succeeded as Viva's father and stepmother accidentally walk in right when Saz is making out with her crush.
-   On the Discovery Health Talk Show _For Women Only: Berman and Berman_, Dr Laura Berman, a sex therapist and Dr. Jennifer Berman, a urologist did a show on teens and sex. They discuss the "pros" and "cons" of virginity. When presenting the case for becoming sexually active, the two doctors point out that an active sex life keeps up a regular blood flow to the pelvic arteries, keeps vaginal tissues in shape and strengthens the vaginal muscles, supporting the concept of "use it or lose it". They also mention that sexual activity can also lead to lighter and shorter menstrual periods. Both of them also mention that the younger someone is when she starts having sex, the easier it is make emotional and sexual adjustments and that when she marries she's more likely to reach orgasm during the first year of marriage. Also both doctors point out that earlier and more frequent sex can improve physical and mental health.
-   Parodied on _Mad TV_ in this sex education film sketch.

    Music 

-   "The Riddler" from Nightwish has the line "...for nature hates virginity..."

    New Media 

-   From the Evil Overlord List: "If a malignant being demands a sacrificial victim have a particular quality, I will check to make sure said victim has this quality immediately before the sacrifice and not rely on earlier results. Especially if the quality is virginity and the victim is the hero's girlfriend."
-   The Nostalgia Chick lampshades this in her review of _Hocus Pocus_. She especially mocks the issue of said virgin being _15_. Thunder also crashes nearly every time she speaks the word "virgin".

     Theatre 

-   Joey from _Me and My Dick_.
-   In John Milton's _Comus_, Comus's argument agains the Lady.
    
    _"List, lady; be not coy, and be not cozened  
    With that same vaunted name, Virginity.  
    Beauty is Nature's coin; must not be hoarded,  
    But must be current; and the good thereof  
    Consists in mutual and partaken bliss,  
    Unsavoury in the enjoyment of itself."_
    
-   In William Shakespeare's _All's Well That Ends Well_, Parolles argues for this.
    
    _"It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a companion. Away with't! 'Tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature."_
    
-   In _The Moon is Blue_, Patty goes from being proud of her virginity to being fed up with it. It's implied that her late-night knock on Don's door would have resulted in her losing it if he had answered.
-   In _Orpheus in the Underworld_, Diana is _supposed_ to be virginal but really wants to get it on with her boyfriend; Jupiter nips this in the bud by turning him into a stag.

    Video Games 

-   Alistair from _Dragon Age: Origins_ is pretty unapologetically a virgin at the start of the game, but if you play as a female character, the _only_ way both of you get to walk away from the Battle of Denerim is by forcing him to impregnate Morrigan as part of a mysterious sex rite.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Double Homework_, Amy’s virginity is a mark of her sheltered upbringing, and she loses it at just about the first chance she gets.
-   The title character of _Melody_ is self-conscious about her virginity, and much of the tension around the middle of the story (on her romantic path) centers around the timing of her losing it to the protagonist.

    Web Comics 

-   _Ménage à 3_: Early on, it is revealed that the nerdish protagonist Gary is a virgin and not happy about it. As such, his plotlines center on attempts by his friends and roommates to get him laid. However, various factors (namely Gary's social ineptitude) seem to conspire against this, which led many readers to assume that Gary would only have sex at the end of the comic's run... except he gets a girlfriend and loses his virginity around the halfway point. The remainder of the comic's run explores how having sex was _far_ from the end of his arc, as he now has to deal with the messy and confusing world of adult relationships alongside everyone else.

    Western Animation 

-   Seymour Skinner and Comic Book Guy from _The Simpsons_.
    
    **Superintendent Chalmers**: Well, it's clear you've been falsely accused. Because no one, anywhere, ever, would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin.  
    **Krusty**: Oh, that's for sure.  
    **Dr. Hibbert**: I'm, uh, I'm inclined to agree.  
    **Groundskeeper Willie**: Ach! I'll never look at him the same again.  
    **Lenny**: That was more than I wanted to know.
    
    -   Although that's possibly just what Skinner wanted the townspeople to think.
-   In the _Family Guy_ episode "Prick Up Your Ears: Lois invokes this trope with Meg while talking about sex with her:
    
    **Lois**: Meg, I still can't believe what you and Doug did last night.  
    **Meg**: Mom, you don't understand, Doug and I are abstinent, but if we have sex in the ear, it doesn't count. We're still pure in the eyes of the Lord.  
    **Lois**: Meg when I was your age, my parents tried to feed me the same nonsense about premarital sex. You're lying to yourself.  
    **Meg**: Well, I don't care what you think! Doug and I are part of the Opal Ring Crusade, and this how we express our love.  
    **Lois**: Look, Meg, A: ear sex is just unnatural and B:... How do I say this? Vaginal intercourse is... it's just tops. It's the bee's knees. Oh, when you rattle it around just right... oh my God! I mean do you remember when we had that old car and used to take the old dirt road on purpose? Meg ...Meg?  
    **Brian**: I love you.
