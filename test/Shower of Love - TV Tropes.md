_"Shower sex is always an explosive orgasm machine in movies. In real life, shower sex invariably results in both parties emerging insufficiently washed and sexually unsatisfied."_

Two people have sex under a running shower. Since shower windows have a tendency to get steamed up, this allows for literal Censor Steam. Sex against the wall _is_ a possibility, but there is the likelihood of injury from slip and fall (which hardly happens in fiction, unless one was to write a romantic comedy that puts a realistic—and painful—spin on this trope).

Often an example of Idealized Sex.

See also Shower of Angst (when a character showers to wash away shame, misery, and/or embarrassment), Shower of Awkward (when Hilarity Ensues — or Unresolved Sexual Tension rises—when one character walks in on another showering and freaks out over it, or someone flushes the toilet), and Shower Scene (Exactly What It Says on the Tin). Compare Two-Person Pool Party.

    Advertising 

-   This is the point of every advert ever created for Herbal Essences shampoo. Most shampoo commercials knowingly hint at it, but these ones feature lashings of Double Entendre and scenes of women in the throes of very Immodest "Organic" experiences. And cameos by Dr. Ruth.
-   This ad for Head and Shoulders shampoo features an attractive young couple sharing a shower taking turns washing each other's hair. The viewers are left with the impression that keeping your hair clean and dandruff will improve your sex life (which it probably will, actually).
-   When you apply Axe's Sex for Product marketing scheme to their line of body wash, you get this.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: When the Gogyosen are controlling boy Matsuri to seduce Suzu, she asks if they can shower together. She gets rejected simply because the ones in control cannot handle someone else being the aggressor.

    Comic Books

-   In the _Jay and Silent Bob_ comic book mini-series, Jay tries to have sex with Tricia in the shower but she kicks him out.
-   This was actually implied in a _Spider-Man_ comic. A caption that divided a scene with Peter and Mary Jane and a scene with Peter at ESU read "One breakfast of corn fritters and a shared shower later..." (This happened during Todd McFarlene's run as the artist, where the title tended to portray the couple as a little risque.)
-   _Topper_ was a comic about a horny ghost that ran in the Australian edition of _Penthouse_. In one strip, he spied on two women in the shower of the change room at a tennis club, and gradually manipulated them into having sex.

    Fan Works

-   In _Superman_ story _Superman of 2499: The Great Confrontation_, Alan and Katherine discover showers are kinky:
    
    **Kath:** We have, haven’t we? Even if we have to fake the seawater thing every now and then.  
    **Alan:** Wouldn’t do to let the bad guys know we can take baths in it. Or that, sometimes, we shower in it.  
    **Kath:** (giggling) Wouldn’t the peejays have a field day with that! Maybe we could convince them that seawater showers are kinky.  
    **Alan:** The Atlanteans have known that for centuries.

    "Will not."  
    "Bet you I can convince you."  
    "I shudder to ask how, Kara. So... how, Kara?"  
    She leaned closer and whispered in his ear, "The showers in these rooms are marvelous, Dev. Really, they are." She kissed his ear.

-   In _Mass Effect 3_, a female Shepard can offer Samantha Traynor the use of her shower (the only decently functioning shower on the ship)... and join her in it. Shepard's comment afterward: "Are you using me for my shower?"
    
    -   Given a reference in _Citadel_, when Traynor prepares to face off with her space chess arch-enemy:
    
    **Shepard:** I'm only going to say this once, Traynor. _\[close-up\]_ My shower is for winners.
    
    **Traynor:** Oh, that's cold. All right. She's going down.
    
    **Shepard:** _(after Traynor wins)_ Nice job, Specialist. Now hit the showers.
    
-   One can take place between Aoba and his Victorious Childhood Friend Koujaku in the _DRAMAtical Murder_ sequel _Re: Connect_.
-   Subverted in _Melody_. Although the protagonist and title character shower and bathe together a few times (on the latter's romantic path), they never go all the way in the shower.
-   In _True Love Junai Monogatari_, Chiemi Fujimoto's good ending has the Player Character and her taking one of these.
-   _Summertime Saga_: If MC's relationship status with them has progressed enough, he can have sex with either Jenny or Debbie in his house's shower on different days of the week.

-   Deconstructed by _CollegeHumor_ in "Showering with Girls", in which Dan states that while he would like to see this trope happen, he goes into (perhaps too much) detail as to why it would be difficult, uncomfortable, or even downright dangerous in real life.

    Web Videos 

-   Deconstructed in WatchMojo's video about "Top 10 Things Movies Always Get Wrong About Sex" (now removed).
    
    **Voiceover**: Shower sex is probably the most annoying thing you can attempt with your partner in the real world. One of you will slip and hurt and/or embarrass yourself, the height difference makes things difficult, one of you will be freezing cold, water does not make the greatest lubricant, having sex standing up is damn near impossible, should we go on? Seriously, don't let the movies fool you — shower sex is the worst.
    

    Western Animation 

-   In _The Simpsons_ episode "Kamp Krusty", Homer and Marge have a scene like this after Bart and Lisa leave for camp.
-   In _Family Guy_ episode "Family Goy", Peter makes love to a life-sized cardboard Kathy Ireland figure in the shower, in an example of taking Cardboard Pal (or perhaps Companion Cube) to its (il)logical extreme.
