**Bart:** Can I see your club?  
**Officer Lou:** It's called a baton, son.  
**Bart:** Oh. What's it for?  
**Officer Lou:** We club people with it.

Call them truncheons, coshes, billysticks, billy clubs, nightsticks, prods, or what-have-you. Shorter than a Martial Arts Staff, different enough from a generic club to be distinct, the baton is the melee weapon of cops, guards, and their ilk.

Depending on the portrayal of the police force, a baton can be:

1.  A heroic weapon (for truly righteous cops such as the Old-Fashioned Copper)
2.  A standard-issue Red Shirt weapon (especially against heavily armed crooks or supernatural menaces)
3.  A symbol of fear (especially when wielded by a Dirty Cop or a Killer Cop — or a whole army of 'em)

Sometimes used to perform a Tap on the Head; however, modern UK training discourages it due to the possibility of fatal injury. They're not used quite as much as they once were now that more sophisticated less-lethal options are available, but they do still have their uses; pepper-spray can rebound on the user in a confined space or if the wind's against you, and tasers are a lot more likely to do permanent damage than a solid whack on the elbow with a big stick.

The Old-Fashioned Copper trope in general also tends to invert the brutality aspect of the trope, since the "no-nonsense" versions prefer guns (in works set at the time when British officers could sign them out of the armoury without much trouble), while the amicable Dixon of Dock Green types prefer old-fashioned truncheons. American officers (at least of the uniformed variety; plainclothes detectives won't be carrying them) will tend to have the tonfa-derived side-handle nightstick on their belt. In feudal Japan, the jitte (basically a metal truncheon with a prong for hooking the opponent or immobilizing a sword before the user can use it) was strongly associated with officers and served as their badge of office.

On the other hand, it can very well lead to The Great British Copper Capture, when an unarmed police officer encounters an armed criminal and it ends badly.

In more modern times, many police departments have adopted the expandable baton (also known as collapsible, telescopic, extendable, tactical, or spring cosh baton), because of how compact they can become when retracted and the ease to store and carry around. There's also the option of a sturdy, big, and heavy flashlight, which can be just as effective for bludgeoning, while also giving a less threatening appearance and, of course, being a light source. There's the added benefit that with modern LED technology, a flashlight big and hefty enough to be used as a baton typically has equally big and hefty batteries that last a really long time.

If a baton is seen in the hands of riot control police, almost always expect it to be used in tandem with a riot shield, giving the officer not only some protection but two ways to dispense blunt force: either good old bludgeoning with the baton or some simple shield bashing.

Another evolution of this trope is its tendency to crossover with Shock and Awe to create a Shock Stick, especially in more futuristic science fiction settings. This is mostly because the two well-known weapons cops have to subdue perpetrators or suspects in the 21st century are either batons or tasers/stun guns. So why not combine both? Makes the law enforcement agents and their ilk's job of enforcing the law or engaging in some Police Brutality much easier.

Compare Carry a Big Stick, Staff of Authority, and Batter Up!. Not to be confused with Battle Baton.

In more recent years, it's been upgraded with a titanium core to counter any attempts to cut through it, and it came in handy against a perp wielding a chainsaw.
-   While he was working for the Bludhaven PD for his day job, Nightwing relied on his baton in situations where every other cop on the force would consider it suicidal to use anything but lethal force.

-   _Discworld_:
    -   In _Jingo_, Commander Vimes receives a truncheon as part of the Watch Commander's regalia; it includes a nameplate reading "Protector of thee Kinge's Piece." He wonders why it's not a sword and then he realizes that it's not meant to be used; it's simply meant to show everyone he's Watch Commander. Also, a sword is a deadly weapon, a truncheon is for bringing people in.
        
        **Vimes:** I'm supposed to keep the peace, I am! If I kill people to do it, I'm reading the wrong manual!
        
    -   He is rather pleased to note that in spite of being made of fancy materials, the ceremonial truncheon does in fact have the same length, weight, and balance as the standard street-issue truncheon.
    -   In _Night Watch_, Vimes completely forbids the watch to carry coshes and blackjacks "available from Mrs Goodbody at No. 8 Easy Street, at a range of prices to suit all pockets, and should any of you approach me privately I absolutely will not demonstrate a variety of specialist blows suitable for these useful yet tricky instruments."
-   In _The Iron Dream_, truncheons are the favourite melee weapon in Held. Feric Jaggar, their leader chosen by fate, wields the _Steel Commander_.
    
    "The shaft as a gleaming rod of some tarnishless metal fully four feet long and thick around as a man's forearm etched all around with rich red traceries of lightning strokes, a motif which made the huge shaft appear as if it had but recently been quenched in blood. The oversize headball was a life-sized steel fist, and a hero's fist at that."
    
-   In the _Matthew Hawkwood_ novels, Hawkwood carries a heavy tipstaff in the inside pocket of his coat, which he is quite adept as using as a weapon; even using it to hold off an assailant who attacks him with a sword in _Resurrectionist_.

-   _Dynasty Warriors_
    -   Zhuge Dan uses a Nightstick in _DW 8_. Fitting for a strategist with authority.
-   _Final Fantasy_
    -   In _Final Fantasy XIII_, most melee-type enemies of the Corps (military/police organization of Cocoon) category wield batons in battle. Some higher-level PSICOM (e.g. Huntress) and Sanctum (e.g. Inquisitrix) enemies have them, as well.

-   _Half-Life 2_: Combine Civil Protection officers wield stun batons that they use when dishing out their particular brand of justice. After Gordon Freeman dons his HEV suit and crushes the skull of a baton-wielding CP with his crowbar, they switch to their pistols and are never seen using their batons again. Worth noting that the one stun baton you get off said CP is collectable not as a weapon, but as a battery for your suit's armor.
-   You can get one in _Hitman (2016)_. It's useful as it allows for quiet non-lethal takedowns, and the baton itself won't be detected if you're frisked.
-   Priere from _La Pucelle_ uses a baton to beat the crap out of her enemies. This carries to her appearances as an Overlord in later Nippon Ichi games.
-   Some of the Infected (police Commons and riot armor Uncommons) in _Left 4 Dead 2_ are still carrying nightsticks on their belts when they encounter the survivors. Though, being zombies, they never actually make use of them. You can loot the nightstick off them after they die, though, but it's a problematic weapon against hordes thanks to its narrow swing arc and unreliable hit detection.
-   Cerberus Assault Troopers and Centurions in _Mass Effect 3_ use batons for their melee attacks.
-   The most obvious example, _Mortal Kombat_'s own local cop, Kurtis Stryker, who utilizes a nightstick alongside other conventional weapons like his handguns and even uses it like tonfas in _Armageddon_.

-   The PR-24 tonfa-style baton appears in the _Police Quest 1: In Pursuit of the Death Angel_. It's kept in Sonny's assigned patrol car when he's not on duty and he's not allowed to carry it into the station. It's used to deal with some unruly bikers who get violent when asked to move their bikes.
-   One of the bosses of _Robo Army_ is a burly robot policeman who swings a laser-firing baton at you.
-   _Star Trek Online_: One variety of Breen mook, the Ak'ched Guard, likes to get up close and personal with a neural truncheon. They're one of the more common varieties of mooks at Breen slave labor camps during the "Breen Invasion" arc.
-   The Imperial Agent's Non-Player Companion SCORPIO in _Star Wars: The Old Republic_ fights using customized electrostaffs that look like police batons, since she is essentially a robotic prison warden who spent most of her existence herding criminals on the prison planet of Belsavis.
-   _Strider Hiryu_ uses a cipher, which is a Laser Blade that resembles the tonfa-style baton.
-   In _Watch\_Dogs_, Aiden Pierce uses a collapsible baton as a melee weapon. It seems to be more for functionality than anything since it's an easily concealable weapon that can take out enemies quickly, relatively quietly, and less lethally.
-   Appears a lot in the _Yakuza_ franchise when the law-enforcement or anything related to their ilk pops up. Batons and nightsticks are also weapons the Player Character can use.
    -   Kaoru from _Yakuza 2_ uses a retractable baton. Notably, she pulls one out when attacking Ryo Takashima in the finale.
    -   Saito from _Yakuza 4_ and his fellow guards uses collapsible batons. Saito's also one sadistic prison guard, using the baton to heavily punish or outright kill the prisoners under his watch. His fellow guards also add in wooden katanas into their melee arsenal.
    -   Koichi Adachi or any male party member that takes the _"Enforcer"_ Job (including Adachi) are armed with batons as their weapons (the latter job uses it in conjunction with a riot shield). Adachi has the _"Detective"_ as his default job which allows him to use different batons or anything that can be used as a baton in a fight.
    -   In _Judgment_, at the start of the boss fight against Mitsuru Kuroiwa, he uses a blackjack sap club to take on Yagami before the latter disarms him.
    -   When Yagami has another boss fight against a member of the law enforcement in _Lost Judgment_ (this time Kisuke Watanabe), the latter pulls out an expandable baton to fight him.

-   In _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_, the Mandalorian police carry electrified stun batons, which look just like an American police officer's side-handle nightstick, because under the pacifist government of the era lethal weapons like blasters are forbidden.
-   The titular _Superjail!_ has Alice as it's sole top prison guard (although Jailbot sometimes helps out too) and befitting her occupation she has a liking for batons, specifically nightsticks and has used them to brutalize the inmates from time to time. She even wielded two of them when taking part in a secret fighting ring where she shoves them into the eyes of her poor opponent. Her Distaff Counterpart, UltraPrison's Bruce makes use of a retractable baton instead, save for one time when he pulled out a massive nightstick out of his trousers (mostly to compete with Alice).
