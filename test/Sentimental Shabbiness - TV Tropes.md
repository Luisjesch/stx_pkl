— _Ben 10_, "Ben 4 Good Buddy"

Lots of people have this one item that they really only keep around for sentimental value, or maybe it does have a purpose, but they don't use some other item instead because this one has sentimental value. Sometimes this item is a bit worse for wear (perhaps it's dirty, stained, worn, broken, or a combination of the above) but that's okay. This trope is for when the wear and tear is seen as a sign that the thing's been loved.

The general logic of this trope is because (barring some situations, such as dust, spills, and being knocked over), things can only get broken, worn, or dirty if they're being used, and if the person didn't love the thing, they wouldn't have used it. Also, some things nearly always wear out if used too much. This trope is also often applied to blankets or plush toys belonging to small children (or people who are a bit older but have had them since they were small children), which makes sense since small children often take less-than-optimal care of their blankets and toys. Another example of when this trope makes sense is if the owner of the item is a dog, because we all know dogs chew things up.

A common way of playing out this trope is to have the object be replaced but the character wants the old one back _because_ it's dirty and/or tattered and therefore has sentimental value, or because the new one is "too clean/perfect". Sometimes, the object is not replaced but rather cleaned or repaired and the character messes it up again because they prefer the way it was before. These plots are common if the character is a small child or a dog (The dog part has a grain of Truth in Television— dogs like objects that haven't been washed because they smell like whoever touched them last..).

In order for it to qualify as an example of this trope, someone (a character or the narrator) has to say or imply that it was "love" that led to the object's wear and tear. If someone's sentimental object is dirty or ragged but no allusion to love as the cause is made, it's not an example.

There are two idioms which describe this phenomenon: "loved to bits/pieces" and "loved to death" (although sometimes both of these are just talking about love itself rather than damage from love.) So well-known is this trope that sometimes people use "loved" or "pre-loved" as a euphemism for damaged, which overlaps with Polish the Turd if they're advertising the damaged thing.

Sometimes is the reason why The Alleged Car is "alleged" (and if that's the case, expect Only I Can Make It Go and/or a vehicle-specific version of Machine Empathy to apply). Compare and contrast Love Imbues Life. Often applies to a Security Blanket, Companion Cube, or Sentimental Homemade Toy. Compare And Call Him "George", for when an expression of love hurts or kills a sentient being. Can sometimes lead to New Technology Is Evil and Older Is Better if people prefer beat-up old tech to new tech.
