Short-tempered, insecure original meets her short-tempered, insecure Bizarro clone.

_"It's funny. Every crook I meet wants to tell me how much I'm just like them."_

When a pair or groups of characters — who'd otherwise be different and/or unrelated — discover that they actually have some things in common, after all.

This is usually the resolution of an Enemy Mine or Locked in a Freezer plot: two clashing individuals learn that there is more that unites them than divides them.

On the darker side, this trope can also be used to lampshade the fact that our hero is really just a hair's breadth away from villainy. In these specific cases, it's almost always the _villain_ who is the first to notice: our hero has him cornered and even seems to _relish_ the prospect of finally ridding himself of his nemesis, and the villain deftly points out, "We're not so different after all", commonly as a way to guilt-trip the hero. This may also be used to try to sway the hero to join his side. The hero realizes how close he is to crossing the line, and spares the villain (though every once in a great while, he'll decide that it's worth crossing the line, off the villain anyway, and then have several episodes of moral anguish over the darkness in his soul: see Shoot the Dog). Especially common when the villain is the hero's Evil Counterpart.

In lighter cases not involving a hero and villain situation, expect the other side to protest strongly with something like, "I'm not like you! I'll never be like you!" when the person they are feuding with points it out. Another common rebuttal is when one side acknowledges that they do share some similarities with the other, but are sufficiently different where it _matters_.

**Please note:** for this trope to apply the similarity between the two or more opposing characters needs to be _acknowledged in-universe_ either by the characters realizing it themselves or by a third party. It isn't limited to only two characters and those involved don't necessarily have to be sworn enemies to qualify; any clashing characters count as long as their similarities are explicitly mentioned, hence the "_remark_" part. Mere implied, subtextual similarities, no matter how obvious they are, or observations made by the audience are NOT examples unless they are also lampshaded within the work itself.

Closely related to Foil, which is a literary term that describes a character who highlights and accentuates the traits of another character by contrast, and Mirror Character, which describes characters highlighted by similarities. However, in these cases, lampshading isn't required.

The Horseshoe Effect is when two people claim to be ideologically opposed to one another, but nevertheless have many beliefs in common.

Contrast with Not So Similar. Also compare Shared Family Quirks (when two seemingly different family members have something in common behavior-wise), Hitler Ate Sugar (when this trope is stretched to the point of becoming a fallacy) and Too Much Alike (when two characters don't get along because of their similarities). See also Mirroring Factions.

-   _Sick Sad World_: In "Missing And Murdered", Dev and Jasmine point out that for all Canada's ragging on the USA, the former is just as bad when it comes to treatment of indigenous people.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Jimmy Jacobs has repeatedly tried to pull this on Jon Moxley. This once lead to the two being chained together in Insanity Pro Wrestling, for a dog collar match after Jacobs cost Moxley the promotion's top championship belt and said that when he looked at Moxley he stared at himself in a mirror.
-   Raven, after deciding that he was insane while in Impact Wrestling and could not be cured, decided that Abyss was the same way and to make Abyss admit it.
-   Bray Wyatt said this to Dean Ambrose on the 10/27/14 episode of _WWE Raw_. Wyatt said that looking at Ambrose was like seeing "a deranged reflection" of himself.
-   Kevin Kelly frequently does this, where appropriate, when addressing feuding members of the Ring of Honor roster. For example, when Kenny King returned from TNA and went on a rant about why he couldn't stand ACH, Kevin asked if The All Night Express, King's Tag Team, weren't a pair of ACHs a few years ago.
-   Mentioned by name in Hallowicked's promo before his CHIKARA Grand Championship title defense against Dasher Hatfield at _CHIKARA The Immaculate Election_, July 26, 2015. He said that Dasher has a "certain nobility about him" that neither he nor Nazmaldun can understand, but that when the Grand Championship is on the line he wants to see how far Dasher is willing to go. At _Babylon Springs_ on November 8th, The Nightmare Warriors (Hallowicked and Frightmare) defeated The Throwbacks (Dasher and 'Mr. Touchdown' Mark Angelosetti), The Osirian Portal and Hermit Crab and Cajun Crawdad in a four-way tag after Dasher abandoned the match when a piece of metal fell out of the elbow pad he'd been using, proving Angelosetti was still cheating. Dasher surrendered the points Dasher's Dugout (Throwbacks/Icarus/Heidi Lovelace) had accumulated in the Challenge of the Immortals tournament, confirming his nobility. However, his shocking heel turn as Grand Champion proved Wicked right, even though his turn was pure selfishness, as opposed to being put under a spell like Wicked was.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

-   _How Green Was My Cactus_: "Boris and Gorby go to McDonald's" is about Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin opening up to western capitalism. Their experience with fast food gives them the following revelation:
    
    "Is not so different! _We_ stand for ages in queue to get served by pimply little people who work like hell for rotten veggies, and the food is terrible!"
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   _In Nomine_: Alaemon views himself and the Archangel Yves as being very much alike — Yves, in the Prince of Secrets' mind, is the ultimate hoarder of knowledge, keeping all of the Symphony's wisdom to himself and only doling out bits and pieces with reluctance. The only difference between the two, in Alaemon's reckoning, is that Yves has a larger hoard and that Alaemon acknowledges what he is.
    
    _Yves has the golden prize — all the knowledge of the world is at his fingertips. And he hoards it and keeps it secret, even if it means Heaven burns. I **am** Yves, ultimately, only more honest._
    
-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Amusingly subverted in storyline when murderous minotaur Angrath tells Technical Pacifist Huatli that they're the same. She defiantly yells that she'll never be like him. But he meant purely in the sense that they're both planeswalkers, and wasn't trying to draw any kind of moral comparison.
-   _Vampire: The Masquerade_: The main book states that Inquisitors can have "Humanity 10 - 5<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , or in other words, be as saintly or depraved as those they hunt"
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Corax comes to this realisation regarding Conrad Kurze during the Heresy — if Corax had been left to his own devices like Kurze, instead of being raised by well-meaning people, Corax could easily have degenerated into a sadistic whackjob like Kurze, and it could have been the Raven Guard betraying the Night Lords on Isstvan V instead of the other way around.
    -   Kurze attempts to prove this to the other Primarchs by capturing and torturing Vulkan. It doesn't work.

-   In _The Complete History Of America Abridged_, Rock Fury, Super GI, confronts Adolf Hitler:

    **Rock**: We succeeded. Besides, we didn't try to wipe out an entire race of people!  
    **Eva**: Vut about ze Indians?  
    **Rock**: Well, we don't lock people away in concentration camps.  
    **Eva**: Vut about ze Japanese-Americans on ze Vest Coast?
    
-   _Cyrano de Bergerac_: Throught Act I and II, Jerkass Woobie, Renaissance Man Cyrano seemed radically different from Giftedly Bad, Butt-Monkey Raguenau. But after Raguenau’s Establishing Character Moment at Act II Scene IV, when he reveals he is perfectly conscientious of being a **White Knight** with his friends, the poets, but doesn’t care of the consequences because he is getting what he wants of them, Cyrano (whom in Act I has spent all his monthly pension paying for the tickets of the play he interrupted) recognizes an equal:
    
    **Cyrano** _(clapping him on the shoulder):_ Friend, I like you right well!...
    
-   The interactive murder mystery _Killing Mr. Withers_ has the villain singing to the Savings and Loan mogul he's trying to murder that they are really not so different from each other. Both of them make a living by ruining other people.
-   _Trifles_: As Mrs. Peters put it, "I know how things can be for women. We all go through the same thing, it's just a different kind of the same thing.", which is to say, though Mrs. Peters or Martha's (Mrs. Hale) husbands aren't as cruel as Minnie's husband (that we know), they are are all equally isolated, dismissed, and oppressed by society and their husbands.
-   This song, performed by comedian Greg Davies when he hosted the 2018 Royal Variety Performance, was both inspired by an example of this trope and subverts it. As the performance is attended by members of the Royal Family, he confessed to his mother about some nerves he was having, only to be told by her that he shouldn't worry because "the Queen is just Prince Harry's nan". This inspired him to write the song, which is about all the ways in which this _isn't_ true:
    
    _My nan likes to potter in the garden_  
    _Though she will concede that the cold rather gets to her knees_  
    _My nan likes doing cryptic crosswords_  
    _And the kettle's always on 'cause she drinks endless cups of tea_  
    _And_ your _nan, your nan's the actual Queen._

-   When Toa Matoro from _BIONICLE_ found himself forced to team up with Big Bad Makuta, Makuta was amused at the way Matoro got out of a certain situation: After using his Mask of Reanimation to use sea creature corpses to fight off Pridak's army of sharks, he was convinced he should have thrown away the mask and never used it. Makuta's response?
    
    **Makuta**: Why so quiet? We have seen death and destruction today with the promise of much more to come. We have seen heroes behaving like villains. You yourself have done things even I would be reluctant to do. It is a time for celebration.  
    **Matoro**: Shut up! I'm doing only what I have to do to save the life of Mata Nui, a life you put in jeopardy.  
    **Makuta**: Think what you like, little Toa, and try to avoid admitting to yourself that you are one bad day, one moment of cruelty, one fit of rage away from being me.
    

    Visual Novels

-   A few cases come up in _Katawa Shoujo_:
