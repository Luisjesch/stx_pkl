**Nappa:** You okay, Vegeta?  
**Vegeta:** Yes, jus—just an aneurysm out of sheer stupidity.  
**Nappa:** Wow. Didn't think you were that stupid, Vegeta.  
_\[Vegeta screams in frustration\]_

Have you ever heard a remark so spectacularly _dumb_ that it just made you angry? Do you have a low tolerance for Cloudcuckoolanders or ditzes?

While some might respond with sarcasm, pity or even despair, these characters just can't handle the dumbness around them. They seethe, they rant, they curse or even resort to violence.

When this trait kicks in it can be the last straw for a normally reasonable person or an intense enough irritation to be their Berserk Button — especially for the Only Sane Man or those Surrounded by Idiots. Of course, this reaction is sometimes totally justified when the act of foolishness has put people in danger.

The results of becoming Enraged by Idiocy can vary from a Dope Slap to a Cluster F-Bomb to acts of violence. As with any loss of temper, this usually becomes a weak point or dangerous distraction for the angry party — making it a handy tactic for anyone merely playing dumb.

A Sub-Trope of Berserk Button. Characters who are the Only Sane Man, Surrounded by Idiots, a Consummate Professional, or an Insufferable Genius tend to have this, but it is also one of the main Jerk Justifications. You can expect the Tsundere to have this characteristic, especially if she's around the Idiot Hero. They may also show someone to be The Comically Serious. This is also a central trope in a Boke and Tsukkomi Routine, where both the _boke_'s idiocy and the _tsukkomi_'s resulting frustration are Played for Laughs. If used excessively, this Trope can turn the Straight Man of the cast into a straight-up Jerkass, whom although gifted with intelligence, is an emotionally hollow brick wall with an exasperating "cup half empty" attitude towards life, refusing to see the _good_ in people favor of justifying his sarcasm and hate for the world by arrogantly accentuating _every_ little flaw in everyone else but himself.

If both the persistent idiocy and the inability to treat the anger go on for too long, it can go into Madden Into Misanthropy territory.

If the enraged character is a leader and the idiocy was committed by a mook, this can lead to You Have Failed Me.

Compare and contrast Blunder-Correcting Impulse. If this is exploited, it can be a form of Correction Bait.

Compare and contrast Fury-Fueled Foolishness; this trope is when anger is _caused by_ idiocy, whereas Fury-Fueled Foolishness is when anger _causes_ idiocy.

Contrast Aroused by Idiocy, which involves a character being _turned on_ by idiocy.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Nacht Faust from _Black Clover_ is a more subdued example than most, but Nacht can't stand incompetency which is the reason why he hates the Black Bulls and never came to the hideout, because they were a band of destructive good-for-nothings in the past which he believes isn't necessarily erased by their recent accomplishments in the war against the elves.
-   Light Yagami from _Death Note_ frequently gets annoyed by Misa Amane's frequent acts of stupidity that constantly puts them at risk of being exposed as Kira. In fact, Misa's actions lead to Light commonly saying "Misa, you idiot!"
-   _Dr. STONE_: Senku gets an Eye Pop when he hears a dumb question.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   _Stardust Crusaders_: While _enraged_ is stretching it, Jotaro Kujo doesn't seem to have the patience for people who do silly things, with Joseph Joestar being a frequent offender.
    -   In _Golden Wind_, Pannacotta Fugo is attempting to tutor Narancia Ghirga in mathematics, and sees that he answered 16 x 55 = 28<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ... after previously having correctly answered 5 x 6 = 30. His response is to _stab Narancia in the face with a fork_.
        
        **Fugo:** _YOU STUPID DELINQUENT! ARE YOU MESSING WITH ME!? HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS BEFORE YOU LEARN!? YOU SHIT FOR BRAINS!_
        
-   In _March Comes in Like a Lion_, Rei becomes incensed when Yasui doesn't learn from his mistakes both inside professional shogi (choosing not to learn from his losses) and outside (opting to once again drink his loss away instead of spending his last Christmas with his daughter as a family and initially pretending to forget about the presents he bought). Implicitly blaming Rei for the latter is what sets it off.
-   Masayuki Hori from _Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun_ is regularly driven to acts of comedically over the top violence by Yuu Kashima's insistence on skipping club practice, irresponsibility, and completely askew sense of pattern recognition. Noteworthy because he absolutely worships Kashima whenever she _isn't_ being an idiot in his presence (which in practice is only when she isn't in his presence at all.)
-   _One Piece_:
    -   While Luffy's extreme stupidity is enough to make all of his friends lose their patience now and then, Nami is the only one to really flip out every time he says something really stupid (which is half of the time; the other half he just says something _somewhat_ stupid). She gets equally angry at the other crew members when they act idiotic. Usopp is becoming similar to her, though he seems more enraged by the inability to think normally than stupidity _per se_.
    -   Sir Crocodile's Fatal Flaw is that he's so incredulously enraged by Luffy's antics that he leaves himself vulnerable by attacking him physically instead of making his usual smart use of his Touch of Death.
-   _Reborn! (2004)_: One of the only times Reborn loses his cool and beats up Tsuna is after he does a blatantly obvious transformation sequence into his adult form behind a tiny rock _and Tsuna is completely unaware they're the same person_, which everyone else in the area lampshades as super dumb.
-   Naofumi from _The Rising of the Shield Hero_ is regularly (and quite justifiably) pissed off when it comes to Motoyasu and the Three Heroes Church. None of which is Played for Laughs, by the way.
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   Luna has this in regards to Usagi, as the latter often fails to take things seriously. Artemis also has this in regards to Minako, but is usually more rational with her than Luna is towards Usagi.
    -   As much as he loves his sister, Shingo can't help but feel annoyed by how ditzy and lazy Usagi is.
-   _Spy X Family_: When Twilight first encounters his incredibly incompetent Unknown Rival, Daybreak, he ends up accidentally breaking character to yell at Daybreak over just how utterly bad the latter was at espionage.

    Comedy 

-   George Carlin dedicated a lot of routines to stupid human behaviour.
-   Lewis Black seems to constantly suffer from this trope.

    Comic Books 

-   This is Atomic Robo's Berserk Button. It's one of the more notable reasons that he hates Dr. Dinosaur.
-   _Deadpool_ — consciously or not — uses this to great effect on his opponents, distracting them with babble until they lose focus.
-   _Lucky Luke_
    -   Luke rarely gets angry, but the prison guards once again letting the Dalton brothers escape from the Cardboard Prison is one way to do it. Once, when he was telegraphed about yet another breakout, his only reply was "idiots".
    -   Joe Dalton often enrages at the stupidity displayed by his brother Averell.

    Fan Works 

-   _Infinity Train: Seeker of Crocus_: Paul London's thoughts on Grace Monroe and Simon Laurent (the leaders of the denizen-killing cult, the Apex) are that they just _don't get the hint_ that they are being assholes who don't give a damn about what they're doing and that the numbers on their arms are worthless except to indicate that they'll have a harder time going home. It doesn't help that Miss Grace "I'm the expert on the Train" Monroe can't accept the hint that she has to change. London makes his annoyance known by beating them within an inch of their lives while they are helpless against a near 40-year-old wrestler that has telekinesis and has nothing to lose at this point.
-   _The Vigilante Boss and His Failed Retirement Plan_: Senkuu finds it incredibly frustrating that society has grown so obsessed with Quirks that simple _intelligence_ is being overlooked, to the point that Pro Heroes are so over-reliant upon their Quirks that they won't consider any alternative or mundane solutions to problems.
-   _Class 78th Watches the Future_: A pretty good way to define the class' reaction to about 90% of Hiro's Free Time Events, and other moments that highlight his thought process. Some highlights include his "explanation" of his clairvoyant abilities and sales pitch for a recording that's supposed to aid the listener in enlightenment (Junko was left massaging her forehead going "Ow. Ow, my brain." at the sheer stupidity involved), the recounting of his "close encounter with aliens" (Which led Leon to ask him point blank whether he was on drugs), his theory that the culprit of Case 3 would be either Chihiro or Alter Ego (Mondo actually had to be physically restrained from beating Hiro to a pulp), and his revelation that he was conned into paying a million dollars for a glass ball (_Byakuya_ lost his temper at that, and Celeste mused that she was right to classify Hiro as D-Rank). Of course, there's also the way everyone reacted when they learned Hiro was willing to ask Makoto to sell his organs to pay off _Hiro's_ debt, rather than dip into his retirement fund, but _that's_ a different trope.
-   _A Game for the Fool_: While reviewing field reports for a group assignment, Wei Wuxian becomes extremely frustrated by the various errors that were made as a result of the field cultivators' clashing egos. He requests to meet with said cultivators so that he can insult them directly to their faces.
-   _Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_: While neither of them tolerate idiocy well, Professor Quirrell tends to react much more strongly than the main character, whose reaction is usually more in line with facepalming. As it turns out, being able to do whatever he wants with idiots is his one remaining pleasure in life and is essentially the main reason Riddle went fully evil.
-   _For His Own Sake_: Most of the Hinata Inn residents provoke this reaction from Keitaro. But Mutsumi is on a whole other level, as her constantly insisting that Keitaro and Naru _need_ to get back together makes her a lightning rod for this, especially when her determination to "help" them get back together results in her working with some Obviously Evil "allies".
    -   After a frustratingly one-sided conversation in which Keitaro repeatedly stresses to her that he doesn't _want_ to be with Naru anymore and that their relationship will never work out, Mitsumi continues to insist that he needs to make up with his ex-girlfriend. Keitaro then hits his Rage Breaking Point and tells her to stay away from him from now on.
    -   During a conversation with Naru's mother, Saori, Mitsumi naively insists that Naru must have gotten over her illness due to "the magic of the inn". Saori explains that she took her to a specialist, only for Mitsumi to declare that she must be mistaken, much to Saori's frustration.
    -   Haruka calls out Mitsumi for trusting two people that she'd only just met to help her "help Keitaro". Even after she warns her about their unsavory history, Mitsumi continues to insist that they can't _possibly_ be bad people. Haruka winds up firing her and banning her from the Hinata property as a result.
    -   When Keitaro is being held hostage by his kidnappers, Naru takes advantage of the situation to rough him up. Then Kagura attempts to seduce him, and Mitsumi protests, having completely ignored what Naru was doing and everything else about the situation:
        
        **Mutsumi:** Kagura, you shouldn't do that. Keitaro is Naru's beloved.  
        **Keitaro:** Oh for God's sake!
        
    -   Finally, when Kagura and Chisato call in their thugs, Mitsumi cluelessly asks why the gang is there when their plan was supposed to be helping Keitaro and Naru get back together. Chisato finally snaps, slaps her, and asks why she thinks everything was going to go according to _her_ plans:
        
        **Chisato:** Will you just shut the hell up? Even _Naru_ said that she didn't want to work things out with Keitaro, so what makes you think that after all that was said, all that you heard that things were going to go as you wanted?  
        **Kagura:** It was so easy to have you wrapped around our fingers, but even so, we didn't think that you were so... well, so stupid. I mean, there has to be a limit of how stupid someone can be, right?  
        **Chisato:** Why on earth would we actually be friends with someone like you? That's why even Naru can't stand you.  
        **Mutsumi:** Stop it please. We're friends. You said that we're friends.  
        **Kagara:** _(addressing some of her hired goons)_ Hey you three, deal with her as well. _(points at Mutsumi)_  
        **Mutsumi** Wait, wait? No, what are you... _(shakes her head, disbelieving)_ No, don't do this.
        
-   _One Eye Full Of Wisdom_: Temari proves to be such a Sore Loser during the Chuunin Exams that she attacks her opponent after the match has already been called, while the Hokage is congratulating them for winning. Her jounin instructor Baki is _infuriated_, and smashes her war fan apart, informing her that she will _personally_ perform every step required to replace it, _after_ explaining herself to her father. Furthermore, she won't have any other missions until she's finished replacing her Wrecked Weapon.
-   In _Going Another Way_, Shinji _goes off_ on Asuka after their first battle with Israfel, calling her out on her Skewed Priorities and inability to work with others.
    
    **Shinji**: You... You damn IDIOT! You always run around with the great Asuka this, the great Asuka that, while in reality you are a total rookie! You ignored orders to satisfy your ego and your battle record is more important to you, than saving mankind! **You make me sick!**  
    **Asuka:** Who do you think-  
    **Shinji:** Oh no. Just shut the fuck up! Shut - the - fuck - up! I have enough of this!
    
-   _My Dream Is Yours_: Ohlm's ditziness manages to drive Jamie Jam absolutely insane when she tries to deliver him a clue as to where she'll strike next in a "Knock Knock" Joke, but he fails to comprehend what such a joke is. He ends up invoking and exploiting this trope fully by the time he's done, as she hits her Rage Breaking Point and forgets the punchline of the joke.
-   _To Protect Everything_: As a Marine, Luffy does _not_ tolerate incompetent subordinates. Especially when that incompetence results in pirates that they've captured managing to break out and make a clean getaway.
-   In _This Bites!_:
    -   Cross and Soundbite usually roll along with Luffy's stupidity. However, they reach their limits when Luffy somehow mistakes Coby (the boy he met when he began his pirate career) for _Natsu Dragneel_.
        
        **Cross**: ARE YOU SERIOUSLY TELLING ME THAT YOUR STUPIDITY _LITERALLY_ TRANSCENDS TIME AND SPACE?!
        
    -   On the side of the Government, as Cross keeps exposing Spandam's evil all over the world in Enies Lobby, Sengoku gets increasingly pissed off at Spandam's idiocy.
        
        **Sengoku**: **YOU COMPLETE AND UTTER FAILURE OF A HUMAN BEING!**
        
-   _Becoming a Man Among Men_: Ranma is repeatedly frustrated by Akane's obstinance and contrariness, such as when she sides with Ryoga after hearing his explanation about the bread feud. He also slaps her when she accuses her sister Kasumi of being a 'whore' simply because she's spending time with Ranma.
-   _Imperial Servant_: When Dabbler, a succubus who was called to perform a "good deed", realizes her summoner doesn't have a "banishing anchor" for her, which is a safeguard to send any summoned creature back where it belongs in an instant, she shows him _why_ banishing anchors are important by attacking him with a flaming sword.
-   _Raise_: As Jaune grows increasingly jaded and embittered by how he's being treated, he starts asking out the people he revives died in the first place. He's quite frustrated to learn that many of the deaths could have been easily prevented by people exercising a little more caution.
-   Downplayed in _The Story of Apollo, Daphne and Luca: An Italian Tragedy_ with the collected, cool-headed and slow to anger Bianca, who gets at the most annoyed and unimpressed by Vincenzo's obliviousness to his own crush on Luca.
-   Akihiko Kayaba of _Sword Art Online Abridged_ has been bottling up two years' worth of rage at the prospect that the lion's share of his player base simply cannot function at a higher level of thought process than "group up and hit it 'til it dies". Part of the reason he took on his Heathcliff alias is to alleviate the massive number of player deaths that resulted from a glitch of his own sleep-deprived creation; that a massive number of players died in incredibly stupid ways despite this does not help his temper one bit.
-   _Nemesis (BeaconHill)_: One omake features Bumblebee using giant bees in trenchcoats and fedoras to scout out a Merchant front casino. The Merchant staff are too stoned to even notice that _half of their customers_ are said giant bees. The Undersiders, who were _also_ casing the joint, find it both hilarious and outrageously infuriating that the staff are so incompetent.
-   _With This Ring_: The protagonist is often disappointed, frustrated, and fed up with people's poor choices. A group of Green Lanterns trying to free a prisoner from a possibly lawful confinement by an epically powerful Lantern really takes the cake, though, in terms of getting him riled.
    
    **Paul**: Illustres to **WHATEVER IDIOT JUST DECIDED TO PICK A FIGHT WITH LORD MALVOLIO I HOPE YOUR LIFE INSURANCE IS UP TO DATE**.
    

    Films — Animation 

-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Rainbow Rocks_: There's only one thing that seems to piss Adagio off, it's Sonata being ditzy and clueless all the time. It's enough to sour her mood even when things are going according to plan.
-   _Strange Magic_: After a line of talking mushrooms creates enough Gossip Evolution that the message "An elf is in the dark forest" becomes "A tall chef is into shark storage", the Bog King gets so frustrated that he physically beats his way through the line of mushrooms until he reaches the original.
-   _Puss in Boots: The Last Wish_: The Wolf, later revealed to be The Grim Reaper has a vendetta against Puss in Boots, disgusted and enraged by the fact the "arrogant little legend" threw away 8 out of his 9 lives (which is far more than most people ever get) on deaths that were _completely_ avoidable and idiotic, such as lifting extremely heavy weights without a spotter, having an oven on too hot, walking off a tall building to prove how cats always land on their feet, eating shellfish despite having a fatal reaction and refusing to stop or get treatment, and firing himself out of a cannon.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _The Big Short,_ investor Mark Baum has no tolerance for anything he suspects is bullshit, and will immediately respond with a barrage of F-bombs.
-   In _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_, King Ghidorah's middle head is very dissatisfied with the antics of the left head, which is clueless as a toddler. He constantly tries to bite on his horns and make him pay focus to their main target.
-   In the _The Pink Panther_ film series, Clouseau's constant bungling actually drives his superior, Chief Inspector Dreyfus, to try and outright _murder_ him.
-   _Star Wars_: Darth Vader has no tolerance for incompetent officers, though he doesn't typically shout or make a big emotional scene. Instead, he prefers to Force-choke them when they fail him for the last time.
-   _The Wolf of Wall Street_ has Max Belfort, Jordan's father and Stratton Oakmont's unofficial CFO. He is frequently seen yelling at his son and his cronies for their behavior such as racking up thousands of dollars in business expenses (read: Hookers and Blow), horsing around while the SEC is visiting the office and all the other idiotic things they do.
-   _Glass Onion_: Benoit Blanc rakes Miles Bron over the coals for being a total clownshoes buffoon who couldn't even come up with a halfway decent plan to commit a murder and ended up having to add two more people to the kill list just to paper over his stupidity. Early on, he even dismisses Bron as a suspect because he wouldn't be stupid enough to murder a woman he'd just had a very messy legal battle with, right? Wrong. Not only is he that stupid, he's so stupid that he _uses his one-of-a-kind car as the getaway vehicle_. Blanc is particularly frustrated that the most inventive part of Miles's scheme was to turn off the lights and try to shoot someone in the confusion, which was not only stolen, but stolen from _Blanc himself_ in an earlier conversation.

    Literature 

-   _Animorphs_: Visser Three. He has little tolerance for incompetence, and more often than not, it ended with whoever was being stupid getting offed (usually by Visser 3 _eating them whole_).
-   In _Dragon Bones_, Ward has been Obfuscating Stupidity for seven years. His father is enraged by Ward's stupid facial expression and overall stupidity - quite ironic, considering that Ward started to pretend to have more brain damage from his father's violent beatings than he actually had because he feared his father would _kill_ him if he seemed too dangerous.
-   _Bruce Coville's Book of... Aliens II_: The alien teacher in _Field Trip_ gets infuriated when the students at the human school he's taken his class to spend more time cracking jokes than trying to spread knowledge, and finally decides to take his students and leave.
-   _The Footprint of Mussolini_: Rommel initially refuses to partake in the plotting of Operation Valkyrie due to his oath to obey Hitler. Then Hitler makes the strategically moronic decision to invade neutral Italy, dragging the entire Roman Alliance into the war on the Allies' side when Germany is already losing on both the Western and Eastern fronts, at which point Rommel decides that Hitler is effectively brain dead and joins the conspiracy.
-   The title character of _Franny K. Stein_ occasionally gets quite furious when she has to deal with stupidity.
    -   A chapter in _Attack of the 50-Ft. Cupid_ has Franny try to talk to a friend from school named Percy over the phone about her latest invention. Percy doesn't pay attention and only babbles about how much he likes corn chips, which causes Franny to angrily hang up the phone while imagining that Percy has a safety pin for a head.
    -   In _The Invisible Fran_, Franny gives her classmates Erin, Lawrence, and Phil an earful for attempting to make improvements to her two-headed robot and instead making the robot into a highly destructive idiot that's now going around vandalizing the school. She also gets really infuriated when she sees that the two-headed robot is going to destroy all the books in the school library.
-   In the _Kharkanas Trilogy_, this is the biggest reason the artist Kadaspala Enes behaves like a Jerkass. He often sees through people and hates it how they shower him with praise when he's looking and call him a pretentious brat when he's not. Add such remarks while he's painting, and he's this close to stabbing people with brushes.
-   In _The Leonard Regime_, Nick demonstrates this whenever Brandon says or does something stupid.
-   In _The Lord of the Rings_, Peregrine ("Pippin") Took accidentally makes a potentially enemy-alerting noise in the Mines of Moria (namely, dropping a stone down a deep well — exaggerated to a bucket with chains in the movie). The usually calm and compassionate Gandalf's response is uncharacteristically upset. (Considering what happens next, it's hard not to sympathise with him.)
    
    **Gandalf:** Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity!
    
-   Known for his "impatience with a less active intelligence than his own," Sherlock Holmes' exasperation at the police's bungling could drive him into condescending rants. The only mention in the entire canon of Holmes cursing comes by his frustration at the police for failing to capture Professor Moriarty after Holmes had all but gift-wrapped the evidence and capture for them.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _All That_ this was practically the entire premise of the "Ask Ashley" sketches. Ashley (played by Amanda Bynes) would receive letters from kids asking her advice, but the questions they ask could easily be solved by someone who had an IQ higher than 3, such as wondering what to do because their house is on fire, or wondering why they can't write very well on a slice of bologna. Ashley _would_ give them the advice they asked for, but she would shout it at them while berating them for being so stupid.
-   _Blackadder_: Later incarnations of Edmund Blackadder are usually quite resigned to being Surrounded by Idiots. Whenever he does snap, however, it's usually because of Baldrick, George, Percy, or The Queen doing something profoundly stupid.
-   In the early days of _Breaking Bad_, Walter was prone to extensive ranting at Jesse's screw-ups.
-   _The Brittas Empire_: Part of the humour of the show is seeing Brittas do this to anyone he meets. People who start the episode calm and collected usually end up trying to kill him or attacking him by the end of the episode. For an example, In "Set In Concrete" he gets someone in to access whether the building has Sick Building Syndrome. By the end of the episode, Brittas has annoyed the guy so much that he loses it and starts shouting to people to get out whilst they still can.
-   This is one of David Mitchell's many buttons, as seen frequently on panel shows, mostly _Would I Lie to You?_.
-   _Doctor Who_: Luke Rattigan, from season 4 of NuWho. He's an Insufferable Genius who, among many things, hate it when people refer to his creation as the ATMOS System. "It's a tautology! It stands for Atmospheric Omission System so you're just saying Atmospheric Omission System System!" Note: that's not a tautology.
-   One of the main sources of humor in _El Chavo del ocho_ is how Chavo's and Quiko's (lack of) intelligence will often exasperate, or infuriate the other characters that have average intelligence.
    
    **Said by several Characters:** I better leave, it (stupidity) may be contagious.
    
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Tywin Lannister. He's perpetually unamused, given that his standards are high, he has no tolerance for incompetence, and Joffrey's rule has been a long parade of follies and disasters. Given that many of his subordinates (including Joffrey) are frequently Stupid Evil, it's little wonder Tywin sees himself as Surrounded by Idiots.
        
        **Tywin:** Madness, madness and stupidity! _(regarding Ned Stark's execution)_
        
    -   Tyrion as well; he has a habit of bitchslapping Joffrey for outstandingly foolish decisions.
-   Gordon Ramsay in both _Hell's Kitchen_ and _Kitchen Nightmares_, to the point where many viewers initially tune in just to watch him flip out... And are probably surprised to discover that he's actually a Reasonable Authority Figure, albeit one with no tolerance for sloppy work or bad behavior, whose legendary rants are reserved for people who have done something to legitimately warrant a reprimand. Which... happens pretty often.
-   Major Hochstetter from _Hogan's Heroes_ gets enraged by simply being in the presence of Colonel Klink and Sergeant Schultz.
-   Uther in _Merlin_. Most of the time it just results in an angry tirade and Merlin getting sent to the stocks, but he isn't above having someone imprisoned or killed if it went too far.
-   By his own admission, Kevin from the US version of _The Office (US)_ has very little patience for stupidity.
-   In _The Outer Limits (1963)_ episode "The Sixth Finger"
    
    **Gwylim Griffiths:** Your ignorance makes me ill and angry.
    
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_: While it's not uncommon for Lord Zedd to lash out in anger, the idiocy of his half-brother Rito Revolto was another story, especially with him getting his name wrong.
    -   _Power Rangers Dino Fury_: The only thing that seems to anger Void Knight outside of the Rangers is the fact that one of his henchman is Mucus, who is far from the smartest or most competent Ranger villain.
-   _QI_: Stephen Fry went off on a tirade on this theme after Lee Mack repeatedly attempted to use the word "ceiling" to disprove the former "i before e except after c"-rule.
    
    **Stephen:** Are you incapable of rational thought?! You cannot be this stupid! You cannot be this stupid!
    
-   In an _SCTV_ skit of Kent Brockman News, the anchor shouted that he was annoyed because "I'm surrounded by _incompetence_!".
-   _Roseanne_: Roseanne is often exasperated by the antics of her friends and family, especially her sister Jackie or her mother Beverley. One stand-out moment is the season 4 episode where the family is preparing to go and see DJ in the Spelling Bee finals, has DJ put gel in his hair and styles it weirdly because he thinks it makes him look good. Roseanne orders him to go upstairs and wash it out, a few minutes later Darlene emerges and says that Roseanne probably should have told him to take his jacket and shirt off first. Roseanne literally pulls at her hair, exclaiming **"Why does he do that?"** before stomping upstairs.
-   _Scrubs_: Dr.Cox habitually makes it clear he has very little tolerance for the antics and stupidity of everyone around him, especially JD.
-   Almost _anyone_ who encounters Frank Spencer of _Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em_ may be calm and collected to begin with, but his seemingly boundless dimness and ineptitude inevitably send them into fits of frothing rage of which they didn't even know themselves to be capable, sometimes followed by blubbering, gibbering insanity. For example, in "The Public Relations Course", PR guru Mr Watson leads a five-day training course, but on the first day, he asks Frank to participate in a role-playing exercise as first a dissatisfied customer and then a PR representative dealing with a dissatisfied customer played by Eddie, a fellow student who has taken Frank under his wing. For the former, Frank simply fires off insults that he heard from Lang, a militant who thinks public relations is pure hokum, and for the latter, he blithely agrees that the dissatisfied customer has grounds to sue his hypothetical employer. Mr Watson flies into a rage, and when Eddie intervenes and says Frank was only trying to help him, Mr Watson snarls, "He's not **supposed** to help you! He's a public relations officer!"... thereby convincing the entire group that Lang is right about PR being pure hokum, leading them to storm out _en masse_.
-   Tony Soprano of _The Sopranos_ has a Hair-Trigger Temper in general, but the stupidity of his mooks and his Son ranks near the top of his list of triggers. In "Remember When", he considers _murdering_ Paulie for his annoying and dimwitted tendencies.
-   One of the few things to make Malcolm Tucker of _The Thick of It_ lose his cool. Witness.
-   _The Tribe_: Ram murders one of his Techno mooks in front of Ebony after the minion presents him with a set of nonsensical programming orders that would actually erase most of Ram's computer systems.
-   In _The Vicar of Dibley_, this seems to be David Horton's default setting. Geraldine dabbles frequently but tends to keep herself more composed.
-   Grimlord from _VR Troopers_ quickly begins to feel this way as the first season wears on and his forces are continually beaten by the VR Troopers, at one point declaring "I am surrounded by incompetence!" He even says a few times he really should just destroy them all for having failed too much, and delivers on this threat during season 2's "Quest for Power" saga after getting a new upgrade and minions; that said, his new minions still enrage him for their failures against the Troopers (who themselves have gotten an upgrade to level the playing field), albeit a bit less.
-   _Xena: Warrior Princess_ appears to experience this while she, Gabrielle, Joxer, and Callisto (who is currently a god) are on their way to defeat another mad god. Joxer falls off his horse (again), and Xena becomes enraged and kicks him out of the party. In reality, she needed to get him away from the rest of the party so that he could retrieve a god-killing weapon without Callisto noticing.

    Music 

-   "Look At All Those Idiots", a song sung by Mr. Burns from _The Simpsons Sing the Blues_.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Sesame Street_: Bert and Ernie may be friends, but the latter's antics tend to drive the former as up the wall as a shows aimed at small children will allow them to.

    Theater 

-   _Brand_, when the quite ditzy bailiff does not grasp the meaning of Brand\`s speech pattern for the umpteenth time, Brand reacts almost with an _Aaaargh_ - or he would have if Henrik Ibsen had read enough comics to get the reference. This instigates a big Berserk Button when his superior, the provost, acts and talks just as stupid.

    Video Games 

-   _ANNO: Mutationem_: In one sidequest, Ann has to find who tossed a computer from the top floor of a building. One of the two suspects claim the other did it after being annoyed by someone ding-dong ditching and took his frustration out on the computer.
-   _Brütal Legend_: Eddie screams in frustration after he sees the lead guitarist of Kabbage Boy climbing on the back of the stage set during the show, which Eddie had explicitly told him wasn't safe. He predictably falls and is saved only by Eddie, setting off a chain reaction that leaves Eddie badly injured and ultimately kicks off the plot of the game.
    
    **Eddie**: You _stupid_, mother_fucking_ piece of shit! I told you not to climb on that!
    
-   In Ashe's recruitment event of _Dissidia Final Fantasy: Opera Omnia_, Penelo asks her to join by saying how much better it will be to be part of a group in the dangerous wilderness. Unfortunately, right behind Penelo are Laguna and Yuffie. Ashe takes one look and turns around to keep traveling on her own.
-   Tamara from _Double Homework_ is the epitome of this. She has no tolerance for bullshit or slowness on the uptake, and pretty much whenever Henry walks into the room and says anything, she gets pissed off.

-   Wess from _Mother 3_. When his son Duster brought back the wrong artifact from Osohe Castle, Wess flips out and smashes it on the ground, then comes with Duster to Osohe Castle to guide him so he gets the correct artifact this time. For the rest of the game, he refers to Duster as "Moron."
-   _Super Mario Bros._: Bowser typically blames his minions for any failures and incompetence whenever they screw up or goof off. He then usually blames them for all of his schemes derailing.
-   Leon Magnus in _Tales of Destiny_. A lot. In the original, he'd use shock tiaras on whoever the perceived idiot is or storm off in disgust.
-   _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines_: Mitnick has a moment with this trope when you first meet him.
    
    Oh my god, are you kidding me? What are you using for security down there, a Trash-80? Guys, it's called "encryption." This is too easy; I'd let you off the hook, but stupidity always brings out the asshole in me.
    
-   _The World Ends with You_: Mitsuki Konishi doesn't tolerate stupidity. This eventually comes to a head after Beat points out that she actually can't predict some of his OWN decisions, tells her that he will become the next Conductor and she will work for him, and she snaps at him in frustration:
    
    **Konishi**: You vexatious monkey! You're right. No analysis could ever plumb the depts of the fatuity...Arrrgh! Enough of your chimp-speak! I will obliterate any disruptive elements in my path!"
    

    Web Animation 

-   _DEATH BATTLE!_: Boomstick's stupidity and general lack of respect for science has more often than not gotten on Wiz's nerves.
-   _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_ tells the story of the Emperor of Mankind, a King in the Mountain who spends his time Catching Up on History. He soon learns that humanity, in the 10,000 years he's been gone, weren't exactly too sharp. This causes him to be anywhere from awfully grumpy to completely outraged about the things he learned about his Imperium's current state.
    -   Magnus, being the Insufferable Genius he is, finds it hard to tolerate both more simple-minded Kitten (who isn't even dumb; just not Primarch-tier) and letters from the Imperial citizens (who _are_ rather unfortunately slow and absurdly ignorant). The former makes him break into lectures and generally snap at him constantly, the other has him fly into rages. Notably, this also applies to _events_ that he finds are stupid, such as when he thought it really was reuniting Vulkan's artifacts that brought the man himself back, meaning a prophecy that had no reason to work was true after all:
        
        **Magnus:** That! Makes! No! SENSE! _WHY WOULD THAT WORK!?_ THAT CAN'T BE IT, THAT'S **STUPID!**
        
-   _The Most Popular Girls in School_: Brittnay Matthews' reaction to Cézanne-Marguerite's, how you say, Verbal Tic is largely this.
-   _Neurotically Yours_: This is mostly Foamy's shtick. He is a squirrel who often rants about humans being stupid and annoying. He even sings about it.
-   This happens a _lot_ in _Red vs. Blue_, usually when the Only Sane Man of the hour loses their patience with The Ditz. But for specific examples:
    -   Agent Carolina's interactions with the Reds and Blues in Season 10; her impatience to find and kill the ex-Director of Project Freelancer, combined with the teams' usual ineptitude makes for some very loud outbursts on her end.
    -   In Season 11, Sarge builds another robot, Lopez Dos-Point-Oh. Unlike the original Lopez, who just sank into immense cynicism, Dos-Point-Oh becomes so stunned by the Red Team's stupidity (Particularly Sarge's) that he uploads his mind into a Humongous Mecha and goes on a shooting spree.
-   _Yo Mama_: Some of the "Yo Mama So Stupid" bits end with Brody yelling at the woman for being such an idiot.

    Web Comics 

-   Black Mage of _8-Bit Theater_. As with most of life's problems, he responds to it with extreme violence.
-   _The Bedfellows_: Be the idiocy in the form of an Ear Worm, or Being Touched, or who knows what else, you can count on Sheen to yell and curse and become violent on a hair-trigger whenever it happens.
-   Alex Williams of _Captain SNES: The Game Masta_ apparently hates stupid people so much that the Anthropomorphic Personification of his "hatred" is, consequently, an utter moron.
-   Dr. Jean Poule (who has a PhD in polymicrofragilistic monoclonalexpialidicous) in _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ has moments of this, due to just how spectacularly dumb and oblivious most of her neighbors are to the paranormal weirdness happening in their midst. Most notably here.
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   Durkon, Roy and Vaarsuvius have each had "moments" thanks to Elan. Thog considering himself to be Roy's Evil Counterpart also drives Roy to distraction.
    -   Redcloak also finds himself exasperated with Xykon's impulsiveness and refusal to think deeply or strategize.
    -   Hilgya Firehelm, a cleric of Loki and the mother of Durkon's child Kudzu, also has no patience for idiocy. This was her main problem with her arranged husband Ivan, whose only seen fault was how incredibly dense he was. She also killed a newly de-vampirized and resurrected Durkon when he proposed to her, raising him again right after and stating that she reserved the right to respond to idiocy with cleansing divine fire.
-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_: This seems to be a factor in Lalli's dislike of Reynir. Lalli is a grown-up Child Soldier with a few years of magic practice behind him, if little training in it. Reynir is a Sheltered Aristocrat with just a few days (a few weeks after a the Time Skip) of even knowing he's a mage, causing him to still be Easily Impressed by the Invisible to Normals aspect of it. When an omen that only the two of them can see appears, Lalli's reaction to Reynir's gawking at it is to scold him for "looking stupid".

    Web Videos 

-   At the end of the _Atop the Fourth Wall_ review of _Marville #4_, Linkara - instead of running down the worst aspects of the issue, as usual — is reduced to screaming.
-   Bennett the Sage did this after sitting through _Very Private Lesson_, with the utter stupidity of the OVA rendering him unable to do anything but scream the name of the subject of his next review when it was finally over.
-   _Brows Held High_ is sometimes immune to this, especially as an actual intellectual among people who merely think they're the same.
-   Common among Caustic Critic reviewers of the late 2000's and the early 2010's, especially The Nostalgia Critic and Spoony.
-   Vegeta, Piccolo and Freeza of _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_, usually thanks to Goku or Nappa. The page quote is the best example in the series to date.
    -   Vegeta had a hard enough time in the anime/manga version, but Nappa and Goku are even stupider here and much to his displeasure they are incredibly hard to kill and tend to come back. His pride prevents him from admitting his own stupidity enrages him as well.
    -   Freeza thinks he's found a worthy opponent in Goku, and he has... physically. But prolonged exposure to Goku's unique personality slowly drives him to greater and greater rage and sanity slippage. It's incredibly satisfying for the audience watching his cold, taunting demeanor dissolve into childish insults and tantrums.
    -   Piccolo deals with it the best, though he still flips out over his student being unable to dodge anything. Goku and Vegeta _do_ make him angry, though he deals with their stupidity through sarcasm and insults later in the series.
-   _Retsupurae_ gives us the Busco Quadnary "Kickstarter Nonstarter", where a man rambles about computer programming in a way that makes it clear he has no clue where he's going with it. Slowbeef, a computer programmer in his day job, _detonates_, collapsing into Angrish about halfway through.
-   _Sgt Ducky_: Ducky believes that a majority of customers don't have the best social skills, he recalls one moment where a customer called the store he worked at just to ask if it's the place they're looking for.
-   Todd in the Shadows frequently gets enraged at pop music in this fashion, though his anger has toned down as his content has matured.
-   _Two Best Friends Play_: Given that Matt is characterized as a moron and Pat is nearly perpetually angry, this trope forms a great deal of the humor in the series.
-   The general endpoint of _What the Fuck Is Wrong with You?_, especially with final stories of live episodes.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Amazing World of Gumball_: While there's no doubt Nicole loves her family, there have been times where they've done something that requires a huge amount of negligence, short-sightedness and (most of the time) stupidity that she'll snap, either shouting or breaking the nearest object. More often then not, it's her husband Richard who brings this out of her.
-   _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_: There's only so much Frylock can tolerate, but Shake's self-centered stupidity has made it so Frylock has no problem hitting him or leaving him to die.
-   Basically _anybody_ who is around _Beavis and Butt-Head_. Needless to say, almost NOBODY has patience with these two morons, and with good reason.
-   _Bob's Burgers_: Bob Belcher does his best to tolerate the zaniness (or more likely stupidity) of the people in his life before he reaches his limit. He's a lot more tolerant of his wife and kids since they're his family, though it's not easy for him. He's a lot less tolerant when it's his sister-in-law Gayle or best friend Teddy, as they've made him hit his Rage Breaking Point for how much their poor decisions or lack of common sense has ruined his day.
-   _Centaurworld_: As shown in a flashback in the episode "Bunch O' Scrunch", Durpleton’s father was very unpleased with his son’s silliness and yelled at him for using stupid nicknames.
-   In a _Codename: Kids Next Door_ episode, after Numbuh 1 gets stranded in a jungle and turns feral, the team's attempts at getting him back yield no results, until they learn the mission they were sent on was for the purpose of learning the answer for a contest to win a decorative keychain as a prize, causing Numbuh 1 to snap back and rant how no mission could ever be so idiotic.
    
    **Numbuh 1:** _**A KEYCHAIN?!?!?!**_ You mean to tell me I risked my life, endangered my team, and spent valuable Kids Next Door resources so you could win _**A STUPID KEYCHAIN?!?!?!**_
    
    -   Numbuh 5 in general, can't stand her other teammates stupidity. She's often seen arguing with The Ditz Numbuh 4, and in the mission where they were being attacked by nerd zombies when she thought they were rescuing a fellow agent, only to find out they were instead rescuing a _trading card_ she snaps and rants at Numbuh 2, who she usually just rags on for making bad puns.
-   An episode of _Dan Vs._ is dedicated to the title character's annoyance at everyone's stupidity.
-   _Daria_: Mr. DeMartino has a Hair-Trigger Temper as a general rule, but few things will send him into a frothing rage as readily as the ignorance of some of his students.
-   Dexter from _Dexter's Laboratory_ is always angered by his older sister Dee Dee messing around with his experiments and breaking things in his laboratory as well as her ditzy behavior.
-   _Ed, Edd n Eddy_:
    -   Eddy sometimes gets annoyed by other people's idiotic behavior around him, especially Ed's. On occasion, though, Eddy seems to be amused by Ed's idiotic antics (as long as they don't ruin one of his plans, obviously).
    -   Downplayed with Edd, based on his last lines at the end of the episode "Dim Lit Ed" but he was more annoyed than enraged. And he's usually much more tolerant of Ed's idiocy than Eddy is.
    -   Sarah, probably even more than Eddy. Unfortunately, she is related to the biggest idiot of the Cul-de-Sac and this makes her almost always angry.
    -   Rolf is a zig-zagged example. He is one of the few kids that don't mind the Eds usually, unless they directly target him for a scam. He has shown to have limits with them and their antics though, like in "A Twist of Ed" when Ed fails to understand his simple explanation of using a smaller rock to break a bigger rock, he becomes _extremely_ tempted to bash Ed's head in with the rock.
-   Col. Nozzaire to Lieutenant Gadget on _Gadget and the Gadgetinis_.
-   In one sketch on _Johnny Bravo_, Johnny faces a supercomputer in a game of chess. Johnny's childishness and stupidity end up frustrating the supercomputer so much that it malfunctions.
-   _Kaeloo_:
    -   Mr. Cat has a Hair-Trigger Temper because he's Surrounded by Idiots but finds stupid people very annoying. To the extent that he's actually tried to kill his friends because they anger him with their stupidity.
    -   Olaf has a pretty short temper, but he gets angry at Stumpy very easily because he's even more of an idiot than the other characters.
-   _Kim Possible_:
    -   While she will never hit him or threaten him for it, there have been times where Ron's childish attitude, clumsiness or general cluelessness get on Kim's nerves.
    -   While Doctor Drakken is her boss, Shego does not hide her snarkiness or lack of respect for him. Whenever he does his more hairbrained schemes, she has very little patience. Based on what we learn of her backstory, Shego became a villain because the annoying personalities and general stupidity of her superhero brothers got on her nerves.
-   Hank Hill on _King of the Hill_ is this rather frequently. He even said as much on an episode where he had to go to anger management classes to end a restraining order filed on him by Dale, saying that he didn't have an anger problem, but an "idiot problem".
-   _Rabbids Invasion_: Gina Xenson is shown to get easily pissed off at the Rabbids' behavior during experiments. Judging by her screams of frustration and constantly banging her head against something, she's been experimenting for quite some time.
-   Benson from _Regular Show_ takes this to new levels whenever Mordecai & Rigby's (_especially_ Rigby) antics create problems for the park.
-   _The Ren & Stimpy Show_: Ren simply cannot stand Stimpy's stupidity. There's a very good reason why his catchphrase is "You eeeeeediot!"
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Frank Grimes in the episode "Homer's Enemy", who comes to work at the Springfield nuclear plant and is driven crazy by Homer’s dangerous incompetence and laziness. Grimes serves as a deconstruction of Homer’s comedic incompetence by being the Only Sane Man at the plant who isn’t desensitized to Homer’s antics, and by demonstrating how quickly a real person would be driven insane if they actually had to work with Homer.
    -   Lisa is like this too sometimes.
        
        **Lisa:** _\[to Homer\]_ You, sir, are a _baboon_! **BABOON, BABOON, _BABOON_!!!**
        
-   Squidward from _SpongeBob SquarePants_. It doesn't help that his house is located smack dab in the middle of complete morons SpongeBob and Patrick's. For Squilvia, this is what makes her attracted to him.
-   Grand Admiral Thrawn from _Star Wars Rebels_ may be a No-Nonsense Nemesis to the Rebellion, but his plans largely fail because he's Surrounded by Idiots. In one example, Governor Pryce blows up the fuel depot for his TIE Defender factory in a (failed) attempt to eliminate a rebel cell. Thrawn (who's on Coruscant at the time) is barely able to restrain his fury as he tells her what the consequences will be.
    
    **Thrawn:** I...will deal with _you_...when I return..._Governor_.
    

    Real Life 

-   Admiral Hyman Rickover, the father of the American nuclear navy, could not stand incompetent subordinates _or_ superiors. One of his men said that Rickover believed if a man was stupid, that man should be dead. However, this attitude was in some ways a positive thing given his profession and job, as Rickover was absolutely determined to have a safe nuclear fleet and it appears to have rubbed off on his successors. To this day, the U.S. Navy has never had a nuclear accident.
-   lot of mobile games ads exploit this trope by depicting a player failing even the simplest puzzles to induce viewers into downloading the game to show up the imaginary player.
