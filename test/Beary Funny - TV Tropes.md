Wocka Wocka!

The only time _this_ bear is bad news is when his jokes are flat.

Perhaps it's because of the proliferation of the Teddy Bear as a child's toy, but bears are often portrayed as Boisterous Bruisers or sometimes just Big Fun, and aren't really looking to eat _people_ so much as just looking to eat. (Truth in Television; most bears are omnivorous and will gladly eat nuts and berries; also, while grizzlies _are_ aggressive, their favorite food is salmon.) Seems most common in Western Animation, although circus bears are common in Real Life.

Ursine Aliens can invoke this trope. Contrast Bears Are Bad News. Compare Beary Friendly, which examples here can also be.

    Advertising 

-   Coca-Cola's famous commercials featuring polar bears that they bring out every year around the holidays. In late 2011, they even released special-edition red-on-white cans (instead of the traditional white-on-red) as part of a "Save the Polar Bears" campaign.
-   Rival Pepsi has used bears for a Super Bowl commercial on a couple of occasions.

-   Charmin toilet paper ads, featuring a family of bears who live in the woods—with a house and bathroom, and therefore also need good quality toilet paper.
-   The Sugar Bear (originally three Sugar Bears), the mascot from the Sugar Golden Crisp cereal boxes, though most ads tried to play him as a cool, jazzy-style character.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Shirokuma Cafe_ has Panda and Polar Bear as two of its core characters. Polar Bear is the owner of the titular cafe and is a Pungeon Master.

Though Grizzly, while a serious character, many of the running gags involve Polar Bear annoying Grizzly and waking him up from hibernation just to ask pointless questions.

    Comic Books

    Films — Animation 

-   Baloo in _The Jungle Book_ epitomizes the "lovable lug" archetype for bears. Baloo was also friends with Mowgli in the original Kipling story, although a less comedic character, but his Disney version is probably the most well-known.
-   Little John in Disney's _Robin Hood (1973)_ splits his time pretty evenly between making cracks of his own and serving as Robin's straight man. It helps that he's basically the same character as the aforementioned Baloo (and voiced by the same guy).
-   Boog the bear from _Open Season_. At the film's opening, He rides a unicycle for crackers for one thing.
-   Bongo the Bear from the first segment of _Fun and Fancy Free_ is a friendly, somewhat bumbling circus bear.

-   The second half of the film _Brave_ had Queen Elinor and the triplets being turned into bears played for comedy except when Queen Elinor slowly loses her mind.
-   Po, the title character of the _Kung Fu Panda_ franchise is initially a bumbling Kung Fu Fan Boy and a bit of a Butt-Monkey. He becomes an Ascended Fanboy and competent Kung Fu warrior, but never loses his comedic side. He's voiced by Jack Black, to boot.
-   Averted with teddy bear Lotso in _Toy Story 3_. He is a manipulative, evil Big Bad.
-   Corporal from _Penguins of Madagascar_ is a Dumb Muscle polar bear whose obsession with cute animals is Played for Laughs.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The bears in the movie based on the Country Bear Jamboree, _The Country Bears_.

-   In _Adventures Of The Wilderness Family_ the bear cubs the family adopts get into all kinds of mischief and chase Boomer's mule around as a Running Gag. The massive black bear, Samson is also Beary Friendly but has a comically huge appetite. His introduction includes him keeping the family up all night eating their cookies, finally leaving when he empties their shelves.
-   _Paddington (2014)_ squeezes in as many bear-related puns as possible.
-   _Song of the South_: Br'er Bear is a Laughably Evil bear.
-   Combined with Bears Are Bad News in _The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra_ in a very funny scene where the characters discuss a farmer being "horribly mutilated", possibly by a bear.
    
    **Paul**: But can a bear do that? Horribly mutilate someone, I mean?  
    **Ranger Brad**: Dr. Armstrong, in my time as a park ranger I guess I've seen bears do some things that even a bear wouldn't do.
    
-   _Gooby_: The titular character is portrayed as a goofy, clumsy yet well-meaning bear buddy that seems to get himself into trouble a lot.

    Literature 

-   J. R. R. Tolkien's _The Fall of Númenor_: Both species of Númenorean bears -black and brown- like dancing, meeting once a year to hold the autumnal Great Bear-dance. Many people attend the gathering because they find the sight of several dozens of bears performing together hilarious; notheless, the public refrain themselves from laughing out loud because bears do not like -at all- the sound of human laughter.
-   _Winnie-the-Pooh_, being based upon a teddy bear, is lovably dim and goodhearted, and is often thinking about honey.
-   _The Berenstain Bears_: Punny Name aside, if one isn't the type to find anthropomorphic bears inherently funny there is the occasional laugh in the siutations the characters get into.
-   _Paddington Bear_ Poor Paddington tries to be a proper gentleman, but a combination of misunderstandings and bad luck keep landing him in strange situations.

-   While the _Hoka_ can be bad for the mental health of those dealing with them, they're very well-meaning, kind-hearted beings.

    Live-Action TV 

-   A running gag on _The Andy Williams Show_ would involve the Cookie Bear (actually a man in a bear costume) coming up and asking Andy for a cookie, and Andy would chase Cookie Bear away, saying "No you can't have a cookie, not now, not ever!" In one Christmas special episode, Andy finally decides to give him a cookie, and then when a poor boy shows up lamenting that he never gets anything for Christmas, the Cookie Bear decides to give his cookie to the young boy.
-   The bear at the zoo in Grey's Anatomy was a running joke. Mostly because it was so boring
-   Kintaros of _Kamen Rider Den-O_ is partially based on a bear; for the most part he Does Not Know His Own Strength, a bit clumsy, and a Gentle Giant all in one package.
-   Brutus the Bear on the nature show _America the Wild_. He was raised in captivity, has absolutely no sense for survival in the wild and is just a cuddly klutz whose human likes to take out to the wilderness to try to demonstrate both the natural power of bears and the complete ineptitude of Brutus (who can't even fish properly!)
-   _Saturday Night Live_: According to Dana Carvey, Christopher Walken likes sketches with bear suits because "Bear suits are funny. And bears as well."
-   _Black Mirror_ episode "The Waldo Moment" has the eponymous character; an animated bear that was used in a topical comedy show. The episode focuses on Waldo entering a real-life election and things soon turn darker.
-   A sabotage on _Cutthroat Kitchen_ during their "Camp Cutthroat" outdoors special Invoked a cross of this and Bears Are Bad News. The sabotaged chef could not touch any of the food themselves, but had to relay all prep and cooking instructions to "Bob the Bear" (a stagehand in a bear costume). The sabotage itself was "bears are bad news," but the way the sabotaged chef and "Bob the Bear" handled it (treating the bear like an oversized, clumsy kid with a short attention span) turned it into this quickly.

    Puppet Shows 

-   The Muppets seemed to be quite fond of showing off ursine characters in this manner:
    -   Fozzie Bear from _The Muppet Show_. He also has his own comedy routine (albeit consisting of bad jokes), and furthermore has been pals with Kermit and other Muppets.
    -   Bobo, a more recent addition to Kermit's entourage. He looks more like a real bear, and in some cases, particularly in recent Muppet movies, such as _Muppets from Space_ and _The Muppets (2011)_, he is depicted as a well-meaning assistant to the Big Bad in the movie in question, one who ends up allying with the heroes.
    -   Baby Bear from _Sesame Street_.
    -   _Bear in the Big Blue House_.
    -   Samson from _Sesamstrasse_, the German version of _Sesame Street_. American audiences got to see him as part of _Sesame Street Stays Up Late_, an international special from 1993.
    -   _Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree_: The local bears are jolly creatures who spend the special celebrating a bear holiday called the Midwinter Honeypot Waltz.
-   The Bear in the Flying Carousel from _Teletubbies_, unlike that other bear from that show.

    Theme Parks 

-   Disney Theme Parks:
    -   The _Country Bear Jamboree_ at Disneyland and Disney World. Bears playing musical instruments! And singing! Want to know why the _Country Bear Jamboree_ is preserved when Disney could easily have replaced it with a more modern updated version? It's widely believed that Walt himself walked into the office of the Imagineer working on the designs and was in hysterics from the pictures of some of the proposed characters and the general idea himself. He then told the man to keep working on the funny bears and said "good-bye." Walt passed away that weekend. Legend has it that the Country Bears were the last happy moment in the life of a man who brought so many happy moments to so many people.
    -   Also, in the original circus segment of the Main Street Electrical Parade, one of the floats was a bear balancing on one foot on a set of barrels while having hoops looping around its arms and legs and balancing a honey pot on its head.

    Video Games 

-   Teddie in _Persona 4_. Though he's not exactly a bear, he's actually a Shadow that takes form of a stuffed bear plush to endear himself with humans, and through interaction with party members, he grew a human body and thus his bear form is just his 'suit'. Otherwise, he fits the trope like a tee, with additions of tons of bear puns. Shadow Teddie, on the other hand... This is Lampshaded in the fighting game.
    
    **Mitsuru**: Really, the only thing you have in common with bears is just the ears...
    
-   Banjo from _Banjo-Kazooie_ definitely counts. Unlike his pal Kazooie, he's incredibly friendly and kindhearted.
-   _Ōkami_ features a sleepy bear who is usually napping, Snot Bubble and all, while standing on some object. Though Susano mistakes him for a "foul beast" and attacks him at one point, all it does is wake the bear (briefly) up.
-   The Brothers Bear from _Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!_.
    -   In _Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze_, the penultimate boss, Bashmaster, the Unbreakable, is a rather odd example, given that he is a ferocious polar bear who wields a giant hammer with ice spikes on one end. When he is first seen, Bashmaster is casually reclining on an ice floe, licking a popsicle, only for DK and/or another Kong to fall on the floe and accidentally knock the popsicle out of the bear's paw and into a purple pool of fruit juice the ice floe is floating on, where the popsicle is eaten by a school of piranhas. This prompts Bashmaster to angrily turn on DK and/or another Kong, who put(s) on a hilarious guilty smile before the battle begins. Then, as the battle goes one, every time you hit Bashmaster, he falls into the pool, which slowly stains his white fur purple!
-   Claire the Bear of _The Sims_ has a flower by her ear, digs through trash cans, interacts with certain appropriate objects (such as teddy bears, bear-skin rugs, and beehives) in silly ways, walks on tiptoes, and does not interact directly with Sims at all.
-   _Tekken_ features Kuma, a tamed, intelligent bear who practices karate. While he _can_ be vicious when motivated, he's typically a silly character who haplessly chases his unrequited love, a female panda. Notably, his most powerful attack is a deadly fart.
-   _Danganronpa_ has Monokuma, in a Laughably Evil combination of this and Bears Are Bad News.

    Web Animation 

-   In episode 11 of _Teen Girl Squad_, What's-Her-Face and the Ugly One sing a "warbly campfire song" about a "chumbly wumbly bear".
-   _DSBT InsaniT_: Bear is a little teddy bear in a comedy series, its a given.
-   In the "Medimoji" series of web animations by ZDoggMD, the lab tech is the teddy bear emoji. (At the time, there was no rat or mouse emoji for the iPhone.) He is a friendly bear, although often stressed out by the challenges of working in a hospital lab: nurses who fail to label specimens correctly, or blame the lab for when they're too hemolyzed to use, doctors who order tests without understanding what's required for them (or even whether they're _really_ necessary), and people (emojis?) who don't understand what the clinical lab _does_ or why it's important.

    Webcomics 

-   _Sore Thumbs_ has a blue midget bear named Coleman as its Animal Mascot. While Coleman still can be vicious, he's also a constant source of comic relief, talks in half-growls, and is small enough to pass for a teddy bear when standing still.
-   When some bar-bear-ian Were-bears turned up in _Exiern_ they unleashed a Hurricane of Puns, utterly un-bear-able in the watching crowd.
-   _Milk And Mocha_ are an Official Couple that get into amusing Slice of Life scenarios. They're also bears.

-   Juuichi from _Morenatsu_, despite his usual expression (his twin brother even more so).

    Western Animation

Due to the magical properties of the realm they were trapped in, every time he removed the tutu, a new one winked into existence to replace it, resulting in a giant pile of discarded tutus.

-   Humphrey the Bear from the Classic Disney Shorts is a Big Eater who gets in hilarious situations while trying to steal food (usually from Donald Duck).

-   Tim, Arianna, and their son from _The Cleveland Show_, the only anthropomorphic cartoon animals on an otherwise completely straightforward Dom Com, and at least part of the joke is that nobody seems to notice that they're, well, bears.

    -   Breezly Bruin, a character from 1964 who always tried to get into an arctic army base.

-   The Tex Avery Oscar-nominated "The Legend of Rockabye Point'' ostensibly starred Chilly Willy, but was all about the hungry polar bear vying for a haul of fish guarded by a vicious dog.
-   Cartoons from MGM would typically display ursine characters in this manner. To wit:
    -   _Barney Bear_ is an unlucky, long-suffering bear in the vein of _Donald Duck_.
        -   One short with Barney is called "Barney's Hungry Cousin", which involves another, skinnier, goofier-looking bear that goes to great lengths to steal Barney's picnic food.
    -   George and Junior, created by Tex Avery.
    -   Another cartoon directed by Tex Avery was called "Rock-a-Bye Bear", in which a dog is house-sitting for a bear in hibernation; but this bear will instantly wake up at the sound of a pin drop and pummel the dog while yelling "QUIET!! SHADDUP! QUIET!!" and warns that if the watchdog makes any more noise, he will replace him with another watchdog. Hilarity ensues as a rival dog attempts to wake the bear up so he can steal the watchdog's job.
    -   There is also a Tom and Jerry cartoon called "Down Beat Bear", which involves a dancing bear that will start dancing to music at will whenever he hears the slightest bit of it — and picks Tom as his reluctant dance partner.
    -   And from the Chuck Jones period of the 1960s, we have _The Bear That Wasn't_, a short cartoon about a bear that gets stuck working in a factory after he's mistaken for "a silly man in a fur coat who needs a shave".
