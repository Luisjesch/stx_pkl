**AGAIN?!** Okay, that's the last straw— Haruhi, I'm billing you for the camera repairs from now on.

_"Just a little plex to protect the lens. They don't like it when we blow up cameras. And we've blown up a lot."_

— **2nd Cameraman Duncan Clark**, _MythBusters_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

No, we're not talking about waterboarding cameras, torturing or beating them, or otherwise inflicting abuse to innocent young cameras. This is something a little bit different.

How does one show that the on-screen action is getting out of control? By having it hit the camera! The entire screen will shake, or be obscured by gunk or debris. If the impact is really bad, it will crack the lens or even break the camera, treating the audience to a screenful of static.

If a character's being shot at, their blood might coat the screen, as if they're being followed by an up-close invulnerable cameraman who happens to get his camera's lens covered in specks of gore, which get wiped off when there's either no more bullets flying or when the character happens to recover some health.

Normally, when a camera shakes during filming, it's considered a mistake, and it's edited out or the scene is reshot. After all, the shake ruins Willing Suspension of Disbelief by drawing attention to the camera — "why the hell is there a camera in the setting?" An actual crack in the camera lens would also guarantee a new shot, since the crack would be in every shot and the lens would ultimately need to be replaced. All the same, some filmmakers and showrunners will use camera shaking or other abuse intentionally, sometimes Played for Laughs. The phenomenon has proliferated to the point where it's being used in computer-generated Special Effects shots, animation, and video games — Camera Abuse _without the camera_.

Of course, Camera Abuse can be justified when it's explicitly presented as the view from an In-Universe Camera — such as an Insecurity Camera, a character's handheld camera, or even just someone's first-person point of view. Not surprisingly, there's quite a bit of overlap with Deadline News.

Camera Abuse is a common form of Breaking the Fourth Wall.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Usually done to add comedy or tension to an action scene.

As a use of the medium as something more than the medium, this is a subtrope of Painting the Medium. Compare Body Wipe, where someone often walks into the camera, Jitter Cam, False Camera Effects, Lens Flare, Screen Shake, Screen Tap, Ominous Visual Glitch, Snowy Screen of Death, Fight Woosh. In a 3-D film, this may be combined with a Paddleball Shot. Frequently overlaps with Interface Screw when used in video games. Not to be confused with Camera Screw. Contrast Shoot the Television, where a screen is broken by someone viewing it instead of inside it.

Also compare Frame Break.

She throws a Frying Pan of Doom at the camera.
-   When the Dairy Queen Lips hear that the restaurant's Chicken Strip Basket is only $3.99, they make a rush for Dairy Queen, only to hit the screen and break it, also chipping one of their teeth in the process.

-   _Fate/stay night_:
    -   In _Fate/stay night \[Unlimited Blade Works\]_, when Shirou gives Archer a "Reason You Suck" Speech in Episode 20, when Shirou looks up to Archer on a hill in Unlimited Blade Works, the left side of the camera is slightly blurry and red because Shirou's left eye is covered in blood dripping from a head wound.
    -   In the first _Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel_ movie, when Shirou shoves Saber out of the way of a blow from Berserker, Saber gets splattered in his blood, including in her eyes. The next shot takes place from her perspective, where a red gradient overlays the sight of Shirou being thrown in the air and seemingly rolling lifelessly next to Illya. This is only in the theater cut and not the Blu-Ray release, however.
-   Unusually for animation, _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ often mimics the look of a hand-held camera by having the picture shake slightly. A lot of the perspectives being shown are from cameras or people's vision (thus why you see the icons on the screen), so some shaking, static, and the occasional Snowy Screen of Death (when the point of view gets knocked out) are to be expected.
-   _Lucky Channel_:
    -   In his appearance, Anime Tenchou violently shakes the camera while claiming the show is too slow-paced. See it for yourself.
    -   In a different _Lucky Channel_, when Minoru finally snaps, he ends up toppling the camera and cracking the lens.

    -   The Brigade production features this as well. When Asahina uses the Mikuru Beam (aimed at the camera) it goes blurry for a few seconds with Kyon sounding like he got hit with something... followed immediately by Nagato tackling her and the camera dropping to the ground as everyone tries to pull her off Asahina.
-   Blood splatters the camera during a Benizakura storyline fight sequence in _Gintama_.
-   The Stinger in the _Spring_ OVA of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ has the Chupacabra some students were looking for throwing a rock at the camera and smashing it.

-   In an early episode of _Birdy the Mighty Decode_, after losing the criminal she was chasing, Birdy kicks a bit of debris in frustration, which hits the camera and sends it tumbling before the view turns to static. Especially strange considering that this is part of a (third-person) flashback supposedly shown directly from her memory.

-   _Heroic Age_: Episode 12 begins with showing the Silver and Bronze Tribe rolling out and one of the space insects apparently proceeds to eat the camera (and probably the camera team as well).
-   Mostly in battle scenes, _The Garden of Sinners_ often uses shaky camera effect. But it's just awesome.
-   _The Idolmaster_: The Futami twins literally hold the camera demanding to be filmed.
-   In _Pani Poni Dash!_, Himeko Katagiri effectively sums herself up in 10 seconds by tripping on a Banana Peel and landing on the camera. See it here.
-   Stand Proud, the third Anime Theme Song for the 2014 adaptation of _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_, covering the Stardust Crusaders arc, ends with Jotaro's Stand, Star Platinum, using its signature Rapid-Fire Fisticuffs to absolutely rip the Fourth Wall a new one.
-   _Attack on Titan_: In Episode 24, the camera lens is briefly splattered with the blood of a Redshirt as the Female Titan wails on the Survey Corps.
-   In _Carnival Phantasm_, during the game show in episode 1, Berserker suddenly beats up a cameraman, shown from the camera's perspective.

-   During one of the _YuruYuri_ Season 1 title calls, Akari trips over herself and bonks her head dead into the camera. She even goes as far as to ask if the cameraman was fine (which he responds by wiggling the camera), and dazedly tries to continue the intro... only for it to cut to the actual episode midway through her sentence.
-   In the first episode of _Hyperdimension Neptunia the Animation_, Neptune tells viewers not to unplug their consoles while they're on, after Histoire does so to get Neptune's lazy ass in gear. Immediately afterwards, the power brick collides with the camera, shattering the lens, firmly establishing that the series has No Fourth Wall.
-   The end credits of _Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team_ is footage from an In-Universe Camera someone set up to record Shiro unaware. When he notices it at the end, Shiro angrily knocks the camera over and it points upward.

    Fan Works 

-   _Blixemi_: Yellowfang attacks the narrator of "Know Your Clanmate" when, in a fit of rage, she claims that Yellowfang really _does_ eat kits.

The episode ends when the camera itself dies.
-   _PONIES The Anthology_:
    -   The second series features this happening in the short "Rarity Wrecks the Camera":

-   Beyoncé takes a baseball bat to a bank's closed circuit camera in the video for "Hold Up", then knocks over the main camera at the end.
-   Unintentionally invoked by melodeath band In This Moment during the filming of their "Prayers" music video, where a camera moving in for a close up broke lead singer Maria Brink's nose (must have been headbanging too hard...). Not to be deterred, Maria just let them superglue her nose back together and finished the shoot. You will notice that in some of the shots of the final video she has her hair pulled over her face to hide the cut.
-   The video for Journey's "Separate Ways" has the keyboardist slapping the camera, which visibly wobbles back.
-   Madonna breaks the camera with her head near the end of the "Ray of Light" video.
-   Also shown in the music video of "Genie", by Korean group SNSD, where the group smashes a cake onto the camera, which is intended to be the viewer of this music video.
-   In the music video for "Mr. Simple," Super Junior's Eunhyuk "kicks the camera" during his dance break, causing cracks to cover the screen for a moment.
-   Tears for Fears:
    -   In the "Pale Shelter" music video, the camera lens is wet when it emerges from the pool and moves towards Roland Orzabal, who looks blurry in the distance strumming his guitar while standing next to a tree.
    -   In the documentary _Scenes from the Big Chair_, Curt Smith accidentally hits the camera next to him during the "Broken" reprise, so the footage is briefly shaky as a result.
-   "Weird Al" Yankovic:
    -   In the music video for "Eat It", Al pokes fun at the sequence from the "Beat It" video where the camera zooms in on Michael Jackson panting by doing a near-identical bit... except the camera gets so close that his breath starts fogging up the lens.
    -   In the music video for "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies\*", Al tries to follow the camera when it does a rapid-fire sequence of continuously changing angles, until he gets so fed up that he grabs the camera to stop it from moving.
    -   He also breathes on the camera in "Eat It" and licks the lens in "Smells Like Nirvana".
    -   During his take on Billy Idol's "Rebel Yell" in the "UHF" video, he punches the screen and cracks it.
    -   Charles Nelson Reilly does the same at the end of "CNR".

    Pinball 

-   The ball save animation in _Jurassic Park (Stern)_ shows an _ankylosaurus_ cracking the screen by smacking a pinball into it.
-   One animation in _Avengers: Infinity Quest_ shows the Hulk punching the camera, cracking its "lens".

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Numerous botches come from the cameramen getting too close to the action, which can result in any number of scenarios:
    -   A simple bump by the wrestlers by simply not seeing them there.
    -   Cameramen tripping over fallen/ing wrestlers.
    -   Getting knocked off of the ring apron.
    -   Some wrestlers (such as Shawn Michaels) simply attacking the cameramen for no real reason.
-   Special mention should go to former WCW wrestler Bunkhouse Buck (a.k.a. Jimmy Golden) who would routinely attack the cameraman _as part of his entrance_, just to underline what a loose cannon he was.
-   Defied at Ring of Honor's 2016 _Global Wars_, where a brave cameraman used his body to protect a $40,000 camera from the partying Young Bucks.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Pob's Programme_ was a Channel 4 children's TV programme. Pob is supposed to live inside the viewer's TV set and the show has Pob apparently breathing on the screen, then writing his name in the steam on the screen. See here.

    Sports 

-   The first year that broadcasters mounted a camera on front end of the barrier separating the main track from the pits at the Indianapolis 500, a car went out of control and hit it head-on.
-   At the Beijing Olympics, one female archer hit a near-impossible perfect bull's eye — straight into the tiny camera in the center of the target.
-   Happened accidentally on the original _American Gladiators_. One contestant was to run the Gauntlet. When the event started, the Gladiator fired his cannon, missed the contestant, and hit the camera, breaking the lens.
-   One behind-the-net camera got nailed by a deflected shot during an NHL game in October of 2010. Play had to be delayed to clean up the pieces. To reiterate: the goal of hockey is to strike a small puck into a net, often at speeds exceeding 100 kph. When broadcasters began putting cameras in the back of the goal nets, this was the obvious result.
-   As with Professional Wrestling, a lot of Camera Abuse in football comes from players accidentally running into the cameramen after being forced out-of-bounds. Here's one example.
-   In a 2009 Ohio State University home football game, during the marching band's performance of Script Ohio, the sousaphone player who's in charge of "dotting the i" in "Ohio" ends up dotting the ESPN cameraman.
-   As most football games are played outdoors, and in the fall/winter with the accompanying weather, a good way to tell that the weather at a game is _really_ bad is to have the precipitation obscure the camera.
-   Due to the nature of the sport, it is not uncommon for Major League Baseball players to accidentally hit cameras (and other expensive equipment), especially when it's a foul ball. Of course, the camera crew are prepared for incidents like this and choose to put an extra layer of glass between the camera and the playing field, creating the "broken lens" effect most commonly associated with this trope.
-   Happened in a 2016 round of the British Touring Car Championship. Hunter Abbott's Chevrolet had a scrape with a car involved in another collision, but thanks to both cars being at precisely the worst-possible angle, Abbott was sent tumbling off the track... and right into a camera tower. Thankfully, nobody was seriously injured.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Atmosfear_: In the introduction to _The Harbingers_, a dice slams through a pane of glass, causing it to look like the screen is broken.

    -   Season 9's premiere episode, Harley Quinn vs. Jinx has this when the latter gets hit with Joker Venom, while this doesn't kill her thanks to her Acquired Poison Immunity, it _does_ trigger a psychotic episode in Jinx building up to her gunning down the camera with Pow-Pow.
    -   At the end of Black Adam vs Apocalypse, when the latter stomps on the former's head from Black Adam's point of view, the screen cracks and stays cracked for the rest of the brutal finisher... and even _after_ the fight, as it's still cracked when the hosts announce the winner after that.
        
        **Boomstick**: En Sabah Nur sure brought the Apocalypse to Kahndaq, and our camera, goddammit! Wiz, that's got to be like what, 30 whole dollars? F\*\*k man.
        
-   _Homestar Runner_:
    -   All the videos that can be downloaded to an iPod end with Strong Bad popping up on a black screen, looking around him and wondering, "What am I doing in this tiny box?" He tries to get out and cracks the "screen," after which he tells the viewer, "Whoops! I hope you got the extended warranty."
    -   Later videos have him popping up at the end and saying "Uh oh! Faceprint!", pressing his face up to the screen and leaving a print. Then he says, "Eugh, you're gonna need one a' those... shimmy cloths..."
-   On The Crack, the narrator screams "YEAH! EPIC EARTHQUAKE!" and starts shaking the camera, leading Jason to fall about uncontrollably. Dan manages to make the narrator stop by telling him "Stop messing with the camera!".
-   In the _Brain POP_ Jr. episode about collages, Moby puts various things on the camera.
-   _Happy Tree Friends_: Choosing "Sprinkle" in "Petunia's Summertime Smoochie" leads to Petunia getting crushed between a blocked water hose and the camera glass. Not a pretty sight.
-   During the warthog chase in _Red vs. Blue: Reconstruction_, some mud splashes onto the camera. Also during explosion effects, since that what _Halo_ does, and _Red vs. Blue_ is made using the _Halo_ engine. Also used if to show something heavy falling, even when the engine wouldn't force them to do so. Such as when Casboose's Berserk Button is pushed in the original series.

    -   At the end of the _SMG4 Crew_ video "Mario Reacts To Funny Tik Toks", Mario gets too overwhelmed with Tik Tok that he grabs the camera, hurls it out of the castle, then runs out and punches it.
