"And every one around Henry Freeman said...

...and grabbed lazer guns and rocks."

_"Any anime where they jump in the opening is a god-tier anime."_

The main characters run towards the camera and jump in unison, putting on their most ridiculous smile and holding their hands in the air. Sometimes a bright light inexplicably appears behind them. The scene freezes while they're all in midair and is used as a splash screen for something. May or may not combine with a Pastel-Chalked Freeze Frame. Frequently an ending. In more realistic works, the characters might freeze while doing something we would actually expect to see in our own lives, like joyously hugging or throwing their hats in the air. (Or, at the other extreme, the characters might self-consciously milk the trope for all its humor by doing something funny, such as flashing the "Ta-da!" or "jazz hands" gesture at the audience.)

This trope was ridiculously common in movie endings in The '70s. _Rocky_ did it most famously, but it managed to sneak into the endings of more serious films too.

Likely as often as not nowadays to be parodied or deconstructed, usually with Gravity Is a Harsh Mistress coming into play.

Not to be confused with the \*glasses\* _**YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!**_ Shot.

Similar in style is the "Kirara Jump" seen in the _openings_ of a lot of anime Slice of Life and "Cute Girls Doing Cute Things" shows. It usually has the cast leaping into the air with their legs bent at the knee. Often, but not always, holding hands.

Compare Victory Pose.

The final shot freezes as all these characters grin over the spread, giving the impression of a boisterous family portrait. (And just for laughs, the sister-in-law greedily reaches for a wing just before the freeze.)

-   A somewhat less-cheery variant shows up at the end of _Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid_.

-   The Jean-Claude Van Damme _Street Fighter_ movie does this as a Shout-Out, which each character doing a version of their Win Pose from the game, just after Bison's castle collapses. It's also a reference to the ending shot of _Super Street Fighter II_, in which after the credits all characters pose together.
    -   This is homaged in _Ted_, as the main characters are big fans of the film. Ted does it with Flash's actor, Sam J. Jones, thanks to the lighting from beyond them.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Black Adder_: The episode "Born to be King" ends with Edmund doing an ecstatic bound in the air.
-   The made-for-TV-movie adaptation of Stephen King's _The Langoliers_ — which, strangely enough, is completely accurate to the original novella.
-   Season 1 finale of _Robin Hood_ (The BBC).

-   _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ had this done several times—at the end of the first episode, at the end of the five-part "Green With Evil" saga, at the end of the two-parter "Doomsday" saga, at the end of the two-part "Green No More", at the end of the two-part "Power Transfer", at the end of the three-part "Different Shade of Pink", and at the end of the two-part "Alien Rangers of Aquitar", with the team putting their hands on top of one another's hand, then jumping up, shouting "POWER RANGERS!". Granted, the "Doomsday" one was meant to have been the end of the series, but you all know how that went...
    -   It was brought back at the end of the "Once a Ranger" two-parter, with the combined group shouting "GO GO POWER RANGERS!".
-   Parodied at the end of _A Bit of Fry and Laurie_'s Australian soap opera sketch, where instead of freezing the frame both actors hold their wacky poses and facial expressions throughout the episode credits, visibly wobbling as they get tired.
-   Done by _Sherlock Holmes_ of all people, at the end of Granada's adaptation of The Second Stain, but with skipping and "wa-heey!" instead of "YEAH." He then turns into a drawing of himself.
-   The opening sequence to _The Mary Tyler Moore Show_ famously ended with one of these showing Mary tossing her hat in the air.
    -   Parodied in the closing credits to the spinoff show _Rhoda_, where that character tosses her own hat and it promptly falls down.
-   Parodied in _A.N.T. Farm_. After solving the problem of the day, Gibson said they should jump and freeze in midair like in old sitcoms, then he starts jumping over and over until, somehow, he actually froze in midair, to the confusion of his friends.
-   _Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt_ parodies _The Breakfast Club_ ending twice, once in the "Kimmy vs. the Reverend" interactive episode as an Easter Egg.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Used in a photo<small>◊</small> from the official coverage of Day 3 of the Pro Tour: Dark Ascension tournament; it's a group shot of the Top 8 all in mid-jump.

    Video Games 

-   The First-Person Shooter _Wolfenstein 3-D_ did this at the end of the first boss level after you beat the big chaingun dude Hans Grosse, and again after you beat Gretel Grosse, Hans's sister, as well as on any custom map including an endgame tile.
-   Used in the Subspace Emissary in _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_, mainly by Mario, Link, Kirby, Yoshi and Pit. They appear up a cliff when some Mooks try to attack some other smashers, and after an Ass Kicking Pose they all jump and the camera freezes. This image of the characters (still looking triumphant) becomes the character selection screen. There are similar shots during the entire storyline, but this one is the most notable.
    -   Preceded by the intro of _Melee_, which included a fast camera pan and "YEAH!" Shot of all of the Pokemon up to _Pokémon Gold and Silver_.
-   The MMORPG _Asheron's Call_ is a unique case that lets you make your own: by using the emote command @atoyot, your character jumps into the air with a raised arm, and freezes there indefinitely until you press any movement key. "Atoyot" is clearly an 80's-era Sdrawkcab Name reference to the commercials mentioned above in the Advertising section.
-   _Sonic The Hedgehog_ has your playable character do this at the end of the first three games jumping towards the screen before striking a pose to the player. The _Sonic Advance_ titles followed suit
    -   While it tapered off sometime during the 3D era _Sonic Adventure 1_ has it at the end of both Sonic's story and Tails' story (and in Tails' case he shows the character growth he experienced throughout the game by flying ahead of Sonic to do his pose to show that he has become confident in his own abilities rather than always playing second fiddle to Sonic).
    -   _Sonic Heroes_ has it as its title screen and, its ending. Seeing as it was a visual (if not gameplay) throwback to the _Sega Genesis_ games. This time the Power Trio of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles do it at the same time.
-   Beating an opponent in _X-Men vs. Street Fighter_ will cause the background to fade to black, your character to freeze frame on whatever animation they're doing at the moment, and a large X or Z to frame around them. Particularly cool if you are Cyclops or Wolverine.
-   _Golden Sun_: _The Lost Age_ does this prior to the end credits with the two main characters and Kraden.
-   _Jables's Adventure_ ends with Jables giving the princess a high-five. Iris Out, roll credits.
-   The true ending of _Contra: Shattered Soldier_ has this, with Bill and Lucia jumping towards the cheering crowd in triumph.
-   Tillis's ending in _Burning Rangers_.
-   _Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze_ features a rare villainous version. If you decide to quit the game during the Game Over sequence, the Painguin Tucks keeping the defeated Kong frozen in a block of ice will do this.

    Web Animation 

-   Pictured above is a machinima of _Half-Life: Hero Beggining_, proclaimed by La Résistance after their leader declares war on the Combines.
-   Lyle and Dexter in _Sanity Not Included_'s Season 1 finale, only with a High Five instead of a "Yeah!"
-   Elementanimation's "An Egg's Guide to Minecraft" parodies this at the end of Part 7.
    
    **Villager:** That's not normal, is it?
    

    Web Comics 

-   Appears in _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja,_ with the Doctor and Judy using an explosion to highlight their high five.
-   Waterworks: "We're gonna steal the water cycle!

    Web Original 

-   The short-lived video series _The New Adventures of Captain S_ had one of these at the end of its first two episodes, following the line "Let's all get shakes!"
-   The second episode of _Mega64_ ends with one of these. Then, "12 minutes later", Marcus jumps up and has one by himself.
-   Seems to be a common theme in wedding pictures that appear on Wedinator.

    -   The 100th episode of Achievement Hunter's _Let's Play Minecraft_ ends with the AH team's _Minecraft_ characters jumping in the air.

    Western Animation 

-   _Filmation's Ghostbusters_ did this on a regular basis.
-   "Go, Team Venture!" (Both lampshaded and played straight, depending on the episode of _The Venture Brothers_.)
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_:
    -   Used at the end of "Band Geeks" with Squidward, and at the end of The Movie with SpongeBob.
    -   "Sharks vs. Pods" ends with the Sharks, the Pods, the police, Internal Affairs, and Mr. Krabs all jumping into the air to celebrate — everyone except Squidward. Patrick then runs in to say "We saved the rec center!", a line that has nothing to do with the plot of the episode and confuses Squidward.
-   Lampshaded by _South Park_ in "Chickenlover", when it happens twice with Officer Barbrady. The first is the apparent culmination, when Barbary has learned to read and delivers a one-liner that now that he's solved the case, he's going to "curl up with a good book", and he gives a thumbs-up and freeze-frames, cheesy music blaring. But no one _else_ is freeze-framed, and they all stare puzzled at Barbrady before eventually all just wandering off. Later, in the actual conclusion, Barbrady comes to the conclusion that reading is awful after plowing through _Atlas Shrugged_ and deigns to never read again, causing a cheer among the boys, and on this, they DO genuinely freeze-frame in the Yeah Shot.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   Parodied in one episode, where at the end of an instructional video the pair of newscasters said "yeah", jumped in the air and froze at the appropriate moment.
    -   Parodied again in the episode "Stewie Kills Lois" where three people jump merrily and freeze after hearing healthy facts about Total cereal.
    -   In "Business Guy", Peter does the Yeah! Shot, can't get down, freaks out, and tells Lois to call a scientist.
    -   In the A-Team episode, Peter and his friends, after shooting down a tree to rescue a kitten, have a celebratory freeze frame...until the owner of the tree screams at them to get off his property.
-   When the censors told the staff of _Invader Zim_ they couldn't just kill a kid at the end of a certain episode, they had him awaken from his wreckage and do one of these instead. Complete with cheesy guitar riff. <sup>*&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Done with the Darings at the end of _The Replacements_ episode "The Majestic Horse".
-   _Fish Hooks_: FRIENDS!
-   _T.U.F.F. Puppy_ does this at the end of each episode. In the pilot, the characters are flung into the air by an action-y event, and freeze in mid air to put goofy faces on. This then becomes a photo on a case file/end title.
-   _Jimmy Two-Shoes_: Jimmy does this twice in one episode, freezing in mid-air. However, no one else does, and they're left wonder how he does it.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_: Lampshaded in an episode, when they do the shot, someone asks when they are going to unfrezee, and someone else says "a few more seconds..."
-   _Regular Show_:
    -   They do this at the end of "Rage Against the TV" with a group high five.
    -   Twice in "Fuzzy Dice" with a group high five. One in the middle of the episode and one at the end.
    -   Done near the end in "A Bunch of Full Grown Geese".
    -   Again in the Sequel Episode "Brilliant Century Duck Crisis Special".
    -   Once again in "Gymblonski".
-   Played straight at the end of _The Simpsons_ episode "Homer Goes to College."
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
-   _The Powerpuff Girls (2016)_: Bubbles does this at the end of the Air Buttercup short after she easily makes a shot into a trashcan when Buttercup can't (despite her extreme measures).
-   In the _Steven Universe_ episode "Alone Together", the Gems try to teach Steven to dance, which he performs badly at. The last has the Gems all perform a "YEAH!" Shot, complete with air hang. When Steven attempts to copy them, he falls right back to the ground.
-   In _Fancy Nancy_, Nancy and her friends do this at the end of "School De Fancy" as they celebrate. Bonus points for a Freeze-Frame Ending as the screen fades to black.
-   The _Work It Out Wombats!_ episode "A Super Recipe" ends with Malik, Zadie, and Zeke jumping in the air, all joyfully shouting.
