A face as fresh as flowers.

Just like blue-haired girls are often withdrawn and anxious, pink-haired girls are often cheery and optimistic or sweet and romantic. There's a high chance that, if a series has a Five-Man Band, a girl with pink hair is The Heart. It's also a popular hair color for protagonists of Magical Girl series, hence Pink Heroine.

Bonus points if she has a blue-haired love interest. She may also have Innocent Blue Eyes, both to reinforce the impression of innocent sweetness and to provide a distinctive visual contrast.

This trope is most commonly found in anime and Animesque media. This is because it is not a natural hair color, which leaves it out of most live-action media, doesn't fit in most Western comics and animation that tend to have muted colors, and cannot be relied upon by most manga since they are printed in monochrome.

This trope doesn't count _just_ for general pink hair. Other shades like magenta or salmon also count, but purple certainly does _not_. Pink-haired _boys_ can also be examples.

Sometimes, Yandere characters who have pink hair can subvert the "sweetie" part, culminating to Psycho Pink.

Sub-Trope of Pink Means Feminine, and Cheery Pink. For animals with pink fur, go see Amazing Technicolor Wildlife. (Note that the two can overlap if anthropomorphism is in effect.)

Compare Fiery Redhead. Contrast Psycho Pink. See also Evil Desires Innocence.

## Examples

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   Misaki Hoshino from _An Angel's Marshmallow_ fits this trope, in the colour pages, at least.
-   Pictured above: Akari Mizunashi from _ARIA_. She is notable in the series that even in a world that almost exclusively populated by idealists (who are at worst grumpy and tired), Akari stands out among them, which gets pointed out in several occasion.
-   Riri Hitotsuyanagi from _Assault Lily: Bouquet_ is a kind, friendly, idealistic girl with pink hair. Her superpower is "Charisma", which makes her such a Magnetic Hero that she gets put in command of her team without even meaning to.
-   Aries Spring from _Astra Lost in Space_, a sweet, kind, and friendly girl with pink hair.
-   There's a few pink-haired girls in _Bakuten Shoot Beyblade_, but the ones that actually match the trope are Mao and Mathilda. Mao is Rei's love interest and even when she too believed him to be a traitor she never gave up on him or wanted him to be anything but happy. Mathilda is The Heart of her team and the one who made the first step in getting rid of their abusive coach. She and Mao get along splendidly in the third season.
-   _BanG Dream!_:
    -   Himari Uehara of Afterglow. A sweet and cheerful girl that always does her best and is a Nice Girl to everyone. While the merchandising would never tell you, Himari is actually the leader of Afterglow, despite being the bassist, as her cheerful demeanor and optimism help win over venue owners and such, whereas lead singer Ran Mitake's aloof nature and social awkwardness lend most people to believing that she's The Stoic. That said, no one, from her bandmates to the audiences, will join Himari in her enthusiastic cries of "Hey! Hey! Hoh!"
    -   Aya Maruyama of Pastel\*Palettes is also a sweet and cheerful girl, or at least she is on the outside. She has a complex of wanting to be noticed and loved. She's also kind-hearted and idealistic, and she's one of the most feminine amongst the entire cast.
    -   Nanami Hiromachi of Morfonica. Although she has difficulties with making friends due to having excellent grades in middle school, she's also a particular Mellow Fellow and affable overall, perhaps as part of trying to be more "normal".
    -   Anon Chihaya of MyGO!!!!! is also a friendly and upbeat girl. Outside of her own personal issues and being an Attention Whore, she's just about as nice as the other pink-haired girls before her.

-   _Bleach_: Pink-haired, hyperactive, Yachiru is the cheerful and optimistic version, always smiling, especially when Kenpachi is enjoying his fights.
-   Hitori "Bocchi" Gotoh from _Bocchi the Rock!_ is an inversion; despite having pink hair, she's withdrawn, anxious and pessimistic. Her mother and younger sister are straighter examples, since they also have pink hair but are more cheerful and outgoing.
-   Princess Euphemia li Britannia and Anya Alstreim from _Code Geass_. Euphy's personality fits with what's expected for this trope, being a Wide-Eyed Idealist in a series known for its Black-and-Gray Morality. Conversely, Anya is an Emotionless Girl...although she wasn't always like that.

-   When alone with her few confidantes, Mina Tepes from _Dance in the Vampire Bund_ often qualifies. The problem is that being a 400 year old Vampire Monarch with vicious political rivals obliges her to take other roles.
-   Chiaki Nanami in _Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School_. Her hair's more pink-brown than actual pink, but she is by far one of the sweetest characters in the cast, believes strongly in The Power of Friendship, and serves as both The Heart and Hajime Hinata's love interest.
-   Kiko from _Darker than Black_ certainly fits the Genki Girl stereotype. However, considering that most of the cast have realistic hair colors and she's a Cosplay Otaku Girl, it's quite possible she dyed it to fit this trope.
-   _Deadman Wonderland_ has Yosuga, a shy and sweet girl with soft pink pigtails.
-   Downplayed with Mitsuri Kanroji from _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_, whose hair is pink and green (which is apparently the result of her eating too much sakura mochi, a sweet which is also pink and green), but the pink part still fits her since she's a sweet girl with hardly a mean bone in her body.
-   Nono of _Diebuster_ has long pink hair and is optimistic, cheerful, strong, and passionate.
-   Mimi from _Digimon Adventure_ dyes her hair pink in 02 to fit her sweet and girlish personality. Going to live to New York and experiencing new fashion tastes must have helped in her decision to change her hair. She eventually changes it back to its natural brown color in _Adventure tri_, but it retains a noticeable pink tint as a remnant of her 02 design.

-   Toa from _Dragonaut: The Resonance_ with Curtains Match the Window set of pink eyes as well. Akira has hot pink hair.
-   _Elfen Lied_:
    -   Nyuu, Lucy's Split Personality. Her hair has a more reddish tint in the anime whereas the manga has it as bright pink. Either way, Nyuu is cheerful (and dumb as a post). This is in direct contrast to Lucy's antisocial, solemn and occasionally psychotic personality. However, Lucy/Kaede _does_ have a sweet and kind side; it's just been buried under years of rage and pain.
    -   Nana, the other Diclonius main character of the series, also plays this trope straight (well, in the anime; the manga gave her purple hair). She's a total sweetheart, compassionate and cheerful (most of the time).

-   Cosette, Ropponmatsu II (partially), and Excel's good conscience in _Excel♡Saga_.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   Sherry, a total Love Freak. Bonus points for her original love interest Lyon, who has light-blue hair.
    -   There's also the docile and kind Stellar Spirits Virgo and Aries.
    -   Meredy is a cute little girl, but is very much The Stoic. She becomes a full-blown example after the timeskip.
    -   Chelia, Sherry's cousin, who is also a Love Freak and very cheerful and friendly.
    -   The Hero Natsu is basically a typical shonen Fiery Redhead, but with pink hair instead of red, making him an inversion.
-   Cheerful and energetic — that definitely describes Haruko Haruhara from _FLCL_.

-   Yuno Gasai from _Future Diary_ has some pretty pink hair and is very cheerful and romantic around her beloved Yukki, but she's definitely not as sweet when it comes to anyone else. It turns out she Used to Be a Sweet Kid in her backstory, but by the first episode, she's a Good Girl Gone Bad due to her Dark and Troubled Past.
-   Milfeulle Sakuraba of _Galaxy Angel_ is the only pink-haired main character (discounting Normad, who is a Jerkass pink plushie) and the only member of the eponymous Angel Brigade who's nice through and through, sometimes to All-Loving Heroine levels.

-   One of the two protagonists of _Go! Go! Ichigo_ is a trans girl named Ichigo<small>◊</small> who has pink hair. She's quite bubbly and perky, though not a Genki Girl.
-   A rare male example: Shuichi from _Gravitation_. He fulfills the optimistic side of the trope, doubling as a Keet.
-   Inori from _Guilty Crown_ has pale pink hair. While she's not at all a Genki Girl, she does share the "pure" personality shown by many other characters on this page; she's one of the most loyal and caring characters in _Guilty Crown_ and becomes something of a Messianic Archetype in the final episode. She also becomes more passionate near the end of the show.

-   Mallow from _Happy Happy Clover_ while she doesn't have hair. Her entire body and fur is a light and dark colored shades of pink. Her romantic side doesn't kick in until a later story in the first volume and comes back again in volume 5 after she hears an accidental love confession from Shallot.
-   Satou Matsuzaka from _Happy Sugar Life_ is a subversion. While she has bubblegum pink hair and acts like a friendly, bubbly girl in public, it's all an act; her real personality isn't sweet at all, and she's really a remorseless murderer and kidnapper.
-   Hinagiku Katsura from _Hayate the Combat Butler_. She fits the cheery subtype and the romantic one, _and_ she has a blue-haired (clueless) love interest.
-   _Hello Sandybelle_: Inverted (and then subverted) with Eva Longwood. After Sandybelle's father dies, she is sent to live with his best friend, Kern Longwood, and Eva hates no longer being an only child. Eva and her mother are absolutely horrible to Sandybelle knowing she's an orphan, and go out of their way to maltreat her. Though, Eva later realizes how she is acting and is ashamed of her behaviour, and apologizes to Sandybelle.

-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   Noriaki Kakyoin from _Stardust Crusaders_ is a gender inverted example. While his hair is more red than pink, he's still shown to be one of the nicest members of the Crusaders, as well as the group's voice of reason.
    -   Reimi Sugimoto from _Diamond is Unbreakable_ is a kind Cute Ghost Girl with pink hair. Though this is only the case in the anime, whereas in the manga she had brown hair.
    -   Trish Una from _Golden Wind_ is a Mafia Princess with pink hair and a mostly pink Stand. While she puts on a spoiled, haughty front, underneath she proves to be a kind and compassionate girl who grows stronger and more courageous.
    -   Yasuho Hirose from _JoJolion_, despite her anxiety, is a pink-haired girl whose kindness leads her to being one of the first people to befriend Josuke.
-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ has Chika Fujiwara, a bubbly, cheerful pink-haired girl who often serves as a foil to her best friend Kaguya's more serious, perfectionist tendencies. She's also a romantic, waxing poetic about love and marriage. Note that this only applies to the anime and live-action adaptations, as her hair is silver in the original manga.
-   _Kaiju Girl Caramelise_: Arata Minami is a male example. Portrayed on the color pages (including the cover of volume 2) as pink-haired, he's a Chick Magnet who is nonetheless happy to date Kuroe Akaishi despite the latter's Creepy Loner Girl appearance and lack of social graces because he sees that she's a kind girl.
-   _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_: Li Raichi, whose pink hair is even styled in Girlish Pigtails, fits the sweet and cheerful mold of this trope, even having a playful side. In fact, even after she's revealed to be a member of YOMI, Kenichi is certain that someone who loves flowers like her cannot possibly be a killer. He turns out to be right, as Raichi only follows the Satsujinken out of necessity and loyalty to her father Li Tenmon (who is also her sensei), and she even ends up falling for him after they fight, showing the romantic side of the trope.

-   _Laid-Back Camp_: Nadeshiko Kagamihara is a kind, energetic girl with pink hair.

-   _Lucky Star_:
    -   Pink-haired Bespectacled Cutie Miyuki Takara is the nicest and sweetest character in the main cast.
    -   Subverted with Akira Kogami, who also has pink hair and can _act_ cheery until something angers her, at which point it doesn't take a whole lot for her true personality (a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing who's very cynical about her career) to surface.
-   The _Lyrical Nanoha_ series plays this absolutely straight with Caro Ru Lushe, a gentle and kind-hearted White Magician Girl of the Riot Force 6's Forward team, yet inverts it to hell and back with Signum, a Stoic and no-nonsense swordswoman with an Old Soldier attitude. There is also Sette, _the_ Emotionless Girl among Dr. Scaglietti's twelve Combat Cyborgs by the virtue/misfortune of having been _designed_ to have the least emotional capacity among the sisters.

-   _Magical Princess Minky Momo_ is a Cute Witch with pink hair.

-   _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_:
    -   Ilulu is initially introduced as an Evil Redhead, but she undergoes a Heel–Face Turn and ends up becoming a loving Friend to All Children (if somewhat inclined to constantly strip naked).
    -   A more grounded example is Kobayashi herself, who has reddish-pink hair and gives friendly advice to those in need...when she's sober. She's quite pushy about maid info when she's out drinking (or in one instance, when Tohru tried to take advantage of a Gender Bender by drugging her).
-   Lacus Clyne from _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_, a peace-loving Idol Singer and daughter to the chairman of ZAFT that is nicknamed the "Pink Princess". However, she's also a Yamato Nadeshiko that intentionally allows people to mistake her gentle nature and idealism for weakness, prior to revealing herself to be a brilliant politician with an iron will and knack for winning people over to her side. By the conclusion of the sequel, she has become the new chairwoman of ZAFT and one of the few remaining political leaders in the world.
    -   Sisters Lunamaria and Meyrin Hawke, from _Destiny_. Both have magenta hair, though Lunamaria is The Heart among the ZAFT pilots while Meyrin is compassionate and kind.

-   Haman Karn of _Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam_ and _Double Zeta_ has pink hair, but is only cheerful and optimistic as a young girl in the _Char's Deleted Affair_ manga set after the One Year War. As an adult and the dictator of Axis Zeon, she’s cold and cynical.
-   _My Dress-Up Darling_: The Inui sisters have both pink hair, but only the younger, Shinju, plays the trope straight. She's a Huge Schoolgirl Shrinking Violet who's easily flustered, but once she gets comfortable with people she's really sweet and friendly, and later chapters show she Took a Level in Cheerfulness once she gets into cosplay herself.
-   Mina Ashido in _My Hero Academia_ is a Rose-Haired and Rose-_Skinned_ Sweetie. She's a perky, friendly and sociable girl who makes friends with ease and is very popular among her classmates. She's also a bit of a Love Freak, getting very enthusiastic about seeing or talking about romance.
-   Subverted in _My Monster Secret_ with Akari's senpai at the maid café, who wants to help Akari be more "feminine". She's short, with Girlish Pigtails, a sweet demeanour, and a cute beaming smile that never leaves her face. And we mean _never_, no matter the circumstances. As a result, she comes off as far more scary than cute (not to mention she's a former delinquent like Akari).
-   Sakura Haruno from _Naruto_. Kind, loving and has cherry pink hair, along with a Hair-Trigger Temper.
-   From _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, Makie Sasaki and the Narutaki twins have all been depicted with either pink or red hair. The first anime switches them all from pink to red hair about halfway through. They also all fit the "cheery girl" stereotype.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Coby is a rare male Shrinking Violet, and in direct contrast to the usual Pink-Haired teenager, he often has a nervous outlook on life — even after taking a small level in Badass.
    -   Princess Rebecca from the Dressrosa arc, hot damn<small>◊</small>. She is Badass Pacifist, but unfortunately for her, she's more of a pacifist than being badass. She is too good-natured to be a warrior and is unable to hurt her opponents despite wielding a sword (for self-defense).
    -   Mermaid Princess Shirahoshi is a Gentle Giant: she's huge, but incredibly kind, sweet, and very polite to everyone.

-   Himeno Awayuki in _Prétear_, the cheerful and optimistic heroine. Also a type B Tsundere to Hayate, the aloof blue haired knight.
-   Most pink-haired girls from the _Pretty Cure_ franchise are either cheerful, sweet or romantically in love with someone, but all of them are All-Loving Heroines.
    -   _Yes! Pretty Cure 5_: Cure Dream, despite how much of a screwup she is, still cares about everyone, and is very energetic.
    -   _HeartCatch Pretty Cure!_: Tsubomi/Cure Blossom, a gentle girl who loves flowers.
    -   _Smile PreCure!_: Miyuki/Cure Happy, fitting to her name, is practically the happiest Cure of them all.
    -   _Doki Doki! PreCure_: Mana, a caring mother to her students who always puts others above herself.
    -   _HuGtto! Pretty Cure_: Hana/Cure Yell, a bubbly, energetic girl who cheers on everyone.
    -   _Hirogaru Sky! Pretty Cure_: Mashiro, a gentle and caring girl who watches over baby Elle-chan.

-   Madoka Kaname from _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_, showcasing her innocent nature.

-   The titular pink-haired Utena from _Revolutionary Girl Utena_ is a passionate and optimistic Action Girl.
-   Moka Akashiya's outer self in _Rosario + Vampire_, who is kind, naive and romantic in direct contrast to her cold inner self who has silver hair.
    -   Interestingly, this seems to have been done for the anime, with Akihisa Ikeda then backporting it to the manga. In the early manga, Outer Moka has brown hair.
-   _Sabagebu!_ has as its protagonist the pink-haired Momoka Sonokawa, introduced as an ordinary schoolgirl in a typical Shoujo manga who gets scouted by a club president. She then turns out to be a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing of the most selfish and vindictive sort. Urara, already in the club, is also a subversion as she is a Psycho Lesbian who loves pain.
-   Chibi-Usa/Sailor Chibi Moon from _Sailor Moon_ is a downplayed case; while she can be bratty and selfish at times, her pink hair still indicates that at her best, she's a Cheerful Child who ultimately has a good heart.

-   _School-Live!_:
    -   Yuki Takeya is one of the sweetest characters, and while she's not romantic, that's because she's the most childish of the group. Too bad she doesn't fit in that world.
    -   Megu-nee is the pink haired Sensei-chan. She's sweet and mature. She's also quite protective as even as a zombie she hid herself away because she didn't want to hurt the children.
-   _Show by Rock!!_ has Moa, pink, curly-haired sheep girl as the band's Genki Girl. (She's practically a Pinkie Pie expy!) Oh, and she's also an alien.
-   Inohara Ran in _Shuukan Shounen Hachi_ is always smiling, can instantly get along with anyone, and wants to draw as much fun out of every second of her life as possible. She's more mischievous and reckless than most examples, but nonetheless, there doesn't seem to be a negative bone in her body. In chapter 21, when she cries briefly, her friend Handa is actually shocked that she has "functional lacrymal glands".
-   _Soul Eater_: There's also Crona, whose hair was pink in the manga but was changed to lavender in the anime, but s/he's more of a Shrinking Violet.
-   _SPY×FAMILY_: Anya Forger is one of the youngest examples of the trope (she claims to be six years old, though she could be even younger), and despite all she's gone through she's a sweet Cheerful Child who loves spending time with her new parents.
-   _ST☆R: Strike it Rich_: Hina has pink hair and is a very friendly girl... who is obsessed with fighting strong opponents and may or may not be responsible for an attempted coup against the Japanese government using chemical weapons.
-   The titular character of _Steel Angel Kurumi_. Despite being created for the purpose of being a weapon, she's more interested in serving and protecting her new master, fitting the romantic aspect of the trope, as well as being a Genki Girl who's always hyperactive and cheery.
-   _Super Sonico_ has pink hair and a shy, innocent and kindhearted personality to match.
-   Nana Hiiragi of _Talentless Nana_ has pink hair styled in Girlish Pigtails and is a very sweet, kind, and friendly girl. Subverted when this turns out to be a calculated plot to deflect suspicion from herself and her true personality: a cold, calculating, and sociopathic Serial Killer who specializes in murdering superpowered "Talented" individuals.

-   _To Love Ru_ has all 3 (naturally they are sisters). Lala is cheerful and optimistic, Nana is the Fiery Red Head and Momo is the sweet and romantic one (although her idea of romantic is rather broad).
-   _Tsukiuta_'s male and female February representatives. They are pink-haired twins named Koi and Ai, and yes, their birthday is Valentine's day.
-   Ran from _Urusei Yatsura_ is a subversion; she has fluffy pink hair and seems like a sweet, romantic girl at first, but this is all a front for how she's actually rather vicious and has a deep grudge against Lum.
-   Momoko from _Wedding Peach_, one of the most upbeat characters and also the heroine.
-   Cheza from _Wolf's Rain_ is the sweet, low-key romantic subtype. For bonus points, the guy who created her has blue hair, not to mention the more tomboyish Action Girl Blue.

-   Yuna from _Yuki Yuna is a Hero_ is a redheaded girl whose hair turns pink when in "Hero" form. She's an optimistic and sweet Genki Girl who is in a school club revolving around community service.
-   _YuYu Hakusho_: Genkai, at least, in her younger days, is an example of the "fiery" sort. It grayed over time, though. However, in the manga, her hair was strawberry-blonde.
-   _Zombie Land Saga_: Sakura Minamoto. Her dark, rosy hair reflects her normally cheerful demeanor. Her cheerfulness doesn't last long after she gets turned into an amnesiac zombie, however. Episode 11 reveals that during her life, she had so many of her accomplishments ruined by bad luck that she became quite cynical and depressed before being inspired again by Iron Frill.

    Comic Books 

-   Devi from _I Feel Sick_ definitely fits 'passionate and strong' and wishes she fit 'romantic'.
-   Megan Gwynn (Pixie) from _New X-Men_ fit the definition for a good while, until Magik (or Magik's demonic clone) got to her. Depending on the Artist, her hair's now either mostly black with pink streaks or mostly pink with black streaks, but either way, she was heavily affected by having bits of her soul ripped out and is suffering some serious overall disillusionment with the X-Adults.
-   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: Wonder Woman's Golden Age Venusian and Silver Age extradimensional ally Queen Desira is pink haired and compassionate, optimistic, generous, matronly and usually quite cheerful.

    Fan Works 

-   _The Night Unfurls_: A kind, polite, and gentle girl with wavy pink hair, Prim definitely qualifies. She is a Wide-Eyed Idealist and the Girly Girl to her cousin Alicia's Tomboy. This pays off in the remastered version, for she is the first Shield to successfully earn Kyril's favour. Within a single chapter.
-   Cindy Jones in the _Thomas & Friends_ fanfic _Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure Bad Ending_ has long pink hair, and is a friendly, kind young woman working as a librarian at Knapford Station.
-   In the _Death Note_ fic _Point of Succession_ Matt is a Rose-Haired _Boy_\-right before Mello was abducted by a Serial Killer he had caused Matt to have a hair dye "accident" dying his hair an embarassing shade of bright pink. Matt has resolved he's not going to dye it back until they've got Mello back.
-   _Pacific: World War II U.S. Navy Shipgirls_ has Mahan.
-   Sakura Tsuitei from _Pretty Cure Full Color_.
-   Shinju Miwa (Cure Pearl) from _Shining Pretty Cure_, in both forms.
-   Subverted in _Star Wars: The Sith, Zero_ as Louise may have bright pink hair but she is far from being that kind All-Loving Hero, especially during her training as Sith. However, her elder sister Cattleya plays this trope straight.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Kimi_: The ending shows Angela's dyed her hair a bright pink, as she's overcome her agoraphobia and happily goes outside with her boyfriend.
-   _Rafiki_: Ziki is a friendly young woman with her hair dyes in multiple colors, pink being the most prominent. She's more romantic and idealistic compared to Kena, her girlfriend.

    Literature 

-   Mizuki Himeji from _Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts_ has long, wavy pink hair. For the most part she's nice and sweet-natured, but she does have a more dangerous side.
-   Marika from _Bodacious Space Pirates_ has pink hair with the cheery and optimistic personality.

-   In all timelines, Fiene in _Endo and Kobayashi Live! The Latest on Tsundere Villainess Lieselotte_ has rose-blonde hair and is a sweet person with a mostly feminine demeanor. Downplayed as the one in the novel's timeline is also a martial artist and big eater.
-   Louise from _The Familiar of Zero_. She's closer to a Fiery Redhead, but over time she becomes less tsun-tsun and more dere-dere to Saito and comes to fit the romantic subtype better.
-   The unnamed protagonist of _Humanity Has Declined_ has pink hair. Part of its setup to look similar to a manga like _Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou_, when in fact it is surreal and satirical; the protagonist is hence a subversion, she acts kind but is guileful and cynical.
-   Effie Trinket from _The Hunger Games_, who can be optimistic and effervescent to an almost manic degree. Her wig is pink in the first book (and in her first scenes in the movie), so it's the one she's most associated with, along with the color pink in general.
-   Evangeline Fox from _Once Upon A Broken Heart_, has rose gold hair. She is optimistic and good natured, capable of forgiving a lot.
-   Akane Kashiwazaki (nicknamed 'Prince') from _Run with the Wind_ is a male variant. He has pink hair, gentle and timid, and by all standards very dorky and cute. Being the Butt-Monkey he is, he's also surprisingly relatable.

-   Kuniko Hojo of _Shangri-La_. Also an Idiot Heroine;
    
    "No plan, no idea!"
    
-   In _Sword Art Online_, there's Rika Shinozaki, AKA Lisbeth, who has natural brown hair, but her in-game avatars have pink hair, and is a cheerful girl who gets along with just about everybody she meets in a short amount of time.
-   _Trapped on Draconica_: Daniar is the strong and passionate type.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Kamen Rider Ex-Aid_: In disguise, Poppy appears as a friendly but down-to-Earth nurse, but in her pink-haired Bugster form she's a bubbly and energetic girl who loves singing.
-   _LazyTown_: Stephanie is a very energetic girl with pink hair who is one of the most moral characters.

    Video Games 

-   _AkaSeka_, being an otome game, provides two male examples.
    -   Mori Ranmaru is a pink-haired dorky and cute teenage guy.
    -   Takenaka Hanbē's hair color is an even lighter pink than Ranmaru's, and he is a pacifist with a calm and gentle demeanor. He is also Delicate and Sickly to boot.
-   _Animal Crossing_:
    -   Reese from _Animal Crossing: New Leaf_ is a sweet, helpful alpaca with pink fur working at Re-Tail. She follows you around, buys things from you, and assists you whenever you want to buy or sell in the flea market. Her husband, Cyrus, has blue fur and is initially overprotective of Resse if you're male (and she's overprotective of him if you're female).
    -   You have the option to start off as a pink-haired female character as the default.
-   Futaba from _Ayakashi: Romance Reborn_ is a kindhearted, heroic onmyouji who saves humans and ayakashi alike.
-   Imoen in _Baldur's Gate_. Somehow, she dyed her hair pink in the sequel. She's a mage and is very cheerful despite all the bad things that happened to her.
    -   An even bigger example is Alora. A halfling thief with an infinitely cheery Genki Girl persona, she encourages the entire party to play nice and do good things. She's pretty good at it too, managing even to get on _Edwin's_ good side.
-   _Battle Chef Brigade_ is full of subversions.
    -   Pontida, the chef at the restaurant in Brigade Town, is pink-haired and kind, and grows adorably tongue-tied around Cezar. However, in her professional setting she an absolute taskmaster, and more of a Stern Teacher than a stereotypical sweetie.
    -   Instructor Razel is mostly a Reasonable Authority Figure, but she doesn't hesitate to lay down the law when the situation calls for it.
    -   Shiv is just a Jerkass, with few (if any) redeeming features.
-   Tori of _Ensemble Stars!_ deliberately plays up this image, playing the role of the cute pink-coloured Cheerful Child. In reality, he is those things, but is also a selfish and demanding wannabe tyrant.
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Attack of Darkforce_ has pink-haired Maria Gerstenbüttel, usually seen with a smile.
-   Subverted by Yuma Lau from _Far Cry 4_. Her hair is pink (dyed), but she's a sadistic evil warden and brutal enforcer even more vindictive than her foster brother Pagan Min.
-   Mash Kyrielight, from _Fate/Grand Order_ definitely counts, being a Badass Adorable Stone Wall in combat as Chaldea's sole Shielder, but also providing plenty of dorky moments and always lights up with a Luminescent Blush whenever the Protagonist chooses a more flirtatious response to her dialogue, thanks to her pure hearted nature as an All-Loving Hero having sworn a Declaration of Protection over her Master and implied crush (i.e., **you**). She's always making sure the player is taking care of themselves, and always tries to find the good in an otherwise bleak situation. She even gives her life in a Heroic Sacrifice at the end of the first major story arc, going out with a smile using her Noble Phantasm to shield you from Goetia's _Ars Almadel Salomonis_. She's become as iconic a symbol of _Grand Order_ as Artoria Pendragon (the original Saber) has from the parent Nasuverse work that started it all, _Fate/stay night_.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Lenna in _Final Fantasy V_ (in her sprites, at least; Amano artwork has her as blonde). Her element is water, which signifies devotion, and she's a Friend to All Living Things princess who treats everyone with kindness and worries very much over the world's welfare.
    -   _Final Fantasy XIII_ has Serah Farron, a cheerful and big-hearted girl who's a Foil to her stoic soldier sister. Vanille (who veers more into a salmon-shade) comes as bubbly and optimistic as they come until it's revealed she's faking it. But even after this, she's still the most upbeat of everyone. Lightning herself is a subversion; while her hair is pink, she is _not_ a sweetie, even though she does level up in kindness during the game.
-   Averted by Poison from _Final Fight_. She's got a giant mane of bright pink '80s Hair but she's a fanservicey thug working for the Mad Gear street gang. She turned over a new leaf when she was moved to _Street Fighter_ but she's as crude as ever.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   Serra from _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_ and Ethlyn from _Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War_ are Genki Girl examples, while Linoan from _Thracia 776_ is the docile Proper Lady variety.
    -   While Mae's original appearance in _Fire Emblem Gaiden_ saw her as little more than a Flat Character joining Celica's journey to help fill out her beginning party, the remake greatly expands on her character, showing her to be a thoroughly good-natured and optimistic young woman, as well as a ride-or-die friend.
    -   Olivia in _Awakening_, except she's a Shrinking Violet. And though the player _really_ has to push it, she can marry the blue-haired Chrom. Cherche, too, as a Proper Lady variant. (Though she can't marry Chrom due to appearing after the Time Skip).
    -   Also, when a male Player Character marries either Cherche or Olivia, their Genki Girl daughter Morgan will possess pink hair. Similarly, if said male character is given pink hair, then his non-Morgan son/daughter will be rose-haired too... meaning one can potentially have a family with _several rose-haired_ people. (And if the mom is Olivia or Cherche, _a whole rose-haired family_.
    -   _Fire Emblem Fates_ has several examples, with the most outstanding ones being Princess Sakura of Hoshido (a Nice Girl type whose children will inherit her pink hair) and an Avatar of either gender who is given pink hair.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_ has Hilda, a sweet girly girl with both pink hair and pink eyes.
    -   _Fire Emblem Engage_ has Lapis and Hortensia.
-   _God Eater_ tries to play this with Kanon Daiba, a gunner who is dismayed that nobody wants to be on a team with her. Turns out this is because she has a nasty habit of friendly fire (using bullets which are prone for it) which may or may not be intentional.
-   Elphelt Valentine of _Guilty Gear Xrd_ has pink hair. She's also obsessed with romance and marriage, to the point where her win animation consists of her running over, producing a marriage contract from her cleavage and trying to convince her beaten up opponent to sign it.
-   _Harvest Moon_:
    -   Nina from _Harvest Moon_ and _Harvest Moon: Magical Melody_ is the optimistic, happy daughter of the local flower shop owner (who also has pink hair).
    -   Her granddaughter, Popuri from _Harvest Moon 64_ and _Harvest Moon: Back to Nature_ is much like Nina. She has the same passion for flowers in _64_ but in most incarnations is a chicken farmer, though is still heavily associated with flowers.
    -   Lyla from _Save the Homeland_ and _Magical Melody_ is a flower shop owner with a permanent smile. She's usually happy and friendly, however it's noted that just because she is smiling doesn't mean she's happy.
-   Tammy in _I Was a Teenage Exocolonist_ is a docile version of this trope. She has pink hair and is the sweetest and kindest member among your childhood friends.
-   Ribbon from _Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards_ is a pink-haired fairy girl from Ripple Star with a sweet and cheery attitude who serves as Kirby's Fairy Companion and helps with gathering the Crystal Shards used to travel between worlds.
-   Saki from _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ and _The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_ is a Rito woman with a tuft of pink "hair" on top of her head along with pink plumage all over her body. She's very polite with Link compared to her terse husband Teba and is one of the more pacifistic Rito characters, as evidenced by her worry over Teba taking their son Tulin to practice archery because the latter is "still so innocent."
-   Mayu Uzaka from _Lightning Legend: Daigo no Daibouken_. She's of the cheery, strong, and passionnate type, being a Tomboy fighting for justice.
-   The Ojou Princess Micaiah in _Mica: Apoptosis_ has very pale pink/purple hair, and is kind and feminine.
-   Ashuku Nyorai of _Namu Amida Butsu! -UTENA-_ is a Girly Girl with long curly pink locks, wears pretty pink clothes and likes cute things and fashion.
-   _Neptunia_:
    -   Compa has strawberry blonde hair that is also referred as pink. She is a sweet, innocent, ditzy girl who is also The Medic.
    -   Purple Sister has pink hair that does not look that much different from her human form's hair. Her personality is basically the same as Nepgear's: sweet, polite, and innocent.
    -   White Sister Ram has pink hair, befitting of her human form's preference for the color pink. Her personality isn't much different from her human form's cheerful, mischievous and bratty attitude. It also contrasts with her docile and shy twin sister's blue hair.
    -   Averted with The Stoic CFW Magic. Her neon-pink hair (and Girlish Pigtails) only adds a contrast to her overall dark design, which makes her overall creepier.
-   Claris Sinclair from _NiGHTS into Dreams…_ She's a very cheerful & bubbly teenage girl. Bonus points for having a blue-haired love interest.
-   Shinatama from _Oni_ has pink hair, and is the kindest, most helpful character in the entire game.
-   Despite being a living shadow of some sort, Vivian from _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_ is rather shy and sweet.
-   Yancy in _Pokémon Black and White 2_ is a really sweet and cheerful pink-haired girl whom the (male) player character meets after finding her missing Xtransceiver, and from then on the two strike a friendship with each other. She's secretly the idol Nancy, as an accidental call reveals. After a few calls, her portrait shows her with Blush Stickers, implying that she's developed a crush on the player.
-   In _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_, Nurse Miriam is popular with the academy students due to her kind and friendly nature, and she has bright pink hair.
-   Averted by Raffina from _Puyo Puyo_. She has the pink hair and aspires to have her own prince, but spends a majority of her screen time being mean to everyone she comes across.
-   Liebea from _RosenkreuzStilette_. Bonus points for being a Proper Lady who's prone to crying.
-   Amy Rose of _Sonic the Hedgehog_ is the very definition of this trope, if her last name doesn't spell it out enough. In addition to having pink fur/hedgehog spines, she is extremely energetic and excitable, incredibly optimistic and cheerful, very kind and friendly (moments of meanness notwithstanding), and is passionately in love with the titular Sonic, who is famously a blue hedgehog.
-   Toadette from _Super Mario Bros._ invokes this trait by having a mushroom cap that's pink in color and having Girlish Pigtails. She also has a braver, more upbeat personality then most other Toads, who are usually Lovable Cowards by default.
-   Cheria Barnes from _Tales of Graces_ is the Team Mom of the party, involved in humanitarian efforts, and at one point shows mercy to someone who previously tried to kill her.
-   Estelle from _Tales of Vesperia_ is a rather interesting example. While she's definitely the sweet, demure, chick of the group, she's also a royal that actually does something and fights in battle with a sword and shield.
-   _Terraria_:
    -   The Party Girl is a cheerful, optimistic Genki Girl who loves parties, and has bubblegum-pink hair.
    -   The Princess is an innocent Cheerful Child and Nice Girl whose hair is the same light pink as her dress.
-   Yuyuko Saigyouji from the _Touhou Project_ series, due to her cherry blossom theme and her cheerful and optimistic personality.
-   Frederica Aesfrost from _Triangle Strategy_ is a graceful, soft-spoken, caring lady who seeks to benefit everyone else. Her pink hair is regarded in-universe as rare and unusual, a result of her Rosellan ancestry, and led to her getting bullied during childhood. She's very self-conscious about it, though Serenoa can compliment her for it.

    Visual Novels 

-   There are two pink-haired girls in the main _Ace Attorney_ games: April May and Geiru. Both of them are cheerful, playful ditzes... until you find contradictions in their testimonies. Then they go berserk on you as you get closer and closer to indict them for a crime. April May is a red herring, while Geiru really is a murderer.
    -   From the prequel spin-off series, _The Great Ace Attorney_, there's Iris Watson, a ten-year old prodigy and inventor who is a complete sweetheart.
-   In _Court Of Darkness_ Princess Sherry Invidia is a cheerful, sweet young woman who likes romance and has light pink hair. Her older brother Prince Roy Invidia is cheerful, sweet, charming and also has light pink hair.
-   _Doki Doki Literature Club!_ plays with this trope with its two smallest members:
    -   Sayori has a peachy pink hair color and is presented as a flightly girl who's The Heart of the titular literature club, loves to eat cupcakes and has a horrible sleef schedule. Later on, Sayori appears to be a tragic subversion of this trope: she breaks down and confesses her depression to the player, revealing that all her quirks are actually symptoms of her depression, and that her Nice Girl persona helps her coping with it.
    -   Natsuki, who has bubblegum pink hair, is a double subversion: she's a Tsundere with the temper to match, but she also has a taste for cute things and is an unequaled cake baker. If you choose her route, she reveals a warmer personality, and in the second part of the game (which rewinds time before her Character Development), Natsuki remains the only sane member<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and in the third day poem, despite having been humiliated and broken during the previous two days, she puts her differences aside and asks for your help to save Yuri.
-   Kendall Flowers from _don't take it personally babe, it just ain't your story_, a charismatic, outspoken, terrifyingly intelligent and occasionally rather insensitive teenage girl.
-   _The Fruit of Grisaia_: Sachi Komine. She's got rosy-pink hair and never refuses anyone's requests.
-   Shiina "Misha" Mikado from _Katawa Shoujo_ is of the cheery, energetic type. She turns out to be a subversion, since she actually dyes her hair pink (she's a natural brunette) and she's not as cheery as she seems.
-   Elodie from _Long Live the Queen_, who starts out as a sweet, innocent, and somewhat naive fourteen-year-old princess who just inherited the throne on her mother's death. Depending on how you play (and whether she survives), she can continue to play out the stereotype, or turn into one hell of a subversion.
-   Rise Rousenin in _Princess Evangile_ is a very polite and kind girl who is also very passionate and emotional. And of course, her hair is light pink.
-   Rose Haibara, spirited protagonist of _Rose Guns Days_, is of a generally kind and understanding nature, making everyone love her. However she _can_ speak strongly when there is something she cannot accept.
-   Rosemary from _Rose of Winter_ gets bonus points for a Meaningful Name. She's optimistic, sweet, a bit naive, and a hopeless romantic, though she can also take down wild animals twice her size with her trademark BFS.
-   Momoko Mori of _Shinrai: Broken Beyond Despair_ has pink hair and is one of the nicest characters in the cast. Raiko, who didn't know her that well, becomes interested in becoming friends with her. In actuality, this is a subversion. Momoko ends up being the killer, killing her boyfriend Hiro and herself in a Murder-Suicide and leaving Kotoba to die in order to frame her best friend Kamen, because she thought Hiro was cheating on her with Kamen.
-   The Standard Branch of the _Tokimeki Memorial_ series has a good number of Rose-Haired Girls. _Tokimemo 2_ has the Shirayuki twins, Miho and Maho, as well as Ensemble Dark Horse Kaori Yae (who happened to be a Genki Girl before the events that made her the Broken Bird she is at the start of the game, and gradually returns to her former Genki Girl self after she overcomes her painful past, thanks to the Power of Love).
-   Kohaku and Hisui from _Tsukihime_. Kohaku is cheery, while Hisui is docile.
-   Damion from _Witches X Warlocks_ has pink hair and is very shy and sweet.
-   Risa from _Three Sisters Story_ is very cheerful, somewhat innocent and the most emotional of her three sisters.
-   Arisa from _True Love Junai Monogatari_ is very cheerful, sweet, and acts (and looks) younger than she is. Averted in the case of Mayumi, though.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   The _SCP Foundation_ has SCP-040, a little girl with pink hair which is implied to be a result of using her power on herself. Her hair is very brittle and falls out a lot. As for "Sweetie", she's one of the nicer, less threatening child SCP items, which isn't saying that much.

    Western Animation 

-   Princess Bubblegum of _Adventure Time_ has many of these traits, except for the romantic part.
-   Dolce from _Angel's Friends_ is of the cheery and optimistic type.
-   Molly of _Bubble Guppies_ is most often the cheery and optimistic kind. She also has a blue-haired love interest.

-   Ami from _Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi_.
-   Kimber Benton from _Jem_ has shockingly pink '80s Hair, and is the most friendly and cheerful of their group, easily befriending Stormer from their rival band The Misfits. She also has the most romantic entanglements aside from Jem herself.
-   The titular character's elf form from _Mia and Me_.
-   _Many_ characters from _My Little Pony_.
    -   Patch, Clover and Sweetheart from _My Little Pony Tales_; Patch and Clover are Genki Girl examples while Sweetheart is the docile version.
    -   Fluttershy from _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ is the docile version, while Pinkie Pie is both the "cheery and optimistic" version and an _extreme_ Genki Girl. In both cases however, you _don't_ want to mess with their friends. Celestia is also depicted with rose hair 1000 years ago, though speculation about what her personality was like back then is just that.
    -   Adding with streaks of lavender, Sweetie Belle as well — the "sweetie" part is even in her name!
-   _Neo Yokio_'s protagonist Kaz could be seen as a Rare Male Example, though he's more melancholy and occasionally selfish than most examples.
-   Tamera from _Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders_ is the sweetest, most gentle member of her team.
-   _Steven Universe_:
    -   The aptly-named Rose Quartz has big, curly pink hair. She's often shown in flashbacks to have been very sweet and caring.
