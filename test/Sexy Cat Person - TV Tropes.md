When it comes to animal symbolism, a major association of felines is with sex. Any feline-themed character is likely to be very sexually attractive and probably the most sexualized character in the work. This can range from actual Funny Animal cats, to characters who are to some degree feline-human hybrids or shifters, to alien or fantasy Cat Folk, to entirely human characters who have a cat theme. Because Most Writers Are Male, this usually applies to female characters, although there are male examples.

It's easy to see why: cat ownership and feline traits have been historically associated with women (although in Real Life an equal number of men and women own cats). Many things men found attractive in women were projected onto cats. They are viewed as graceful, gymnastic, and flexible; they have a mercurial temperament; if they aren't neutered, they make it obvious to everyone around when they're in heat, and even when not in heat, they have no shame in their love of being petted and stroked. It can't be a coincidence that "sex kitten" rapidly became a term for female sex symbols. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Note that for this to be the case, the character's sexiness and feline associations must both be unusual within the work — if a work has a cast made up mostly of anthropomorphic cats, don't add the sexy one. It also has to be the case _within the work_, so Self-Fanservice of a character who happens to be a feline but isn't particularly sexualized in canon — such as, say, Blaze from the _Sonic the Hedgehog_ series — doesn't count.

There is a very strong overlap with Classy Cat-Burglar. See also Cat Girl, although they vary in their degree of sexualisation, with some being platonically "cute". Compare to Cool Cat.

See also Foxy Vixen for this trope's canid counterpart, as well as Snakes Are Sexy and Seductive Spider.

-   Deconstructed with _Biggie Bear_'s Miss Pussycat — she's the only girl, and looks rather nice enough. Enough for the titular character to sexually assault her.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Yoruichi from _Bleach_ is a sexy tanned kunoichi who can turn into a black cat and would wind up naked when reverting to her human form.
-   Yukari Kotozume aka Cure Macaron from _KiraKira★Pretty Cure à la Mode_ who has a cat motif. She is portrayed as the most attractive member of the group to the point that Even the Girls Want Her. She can also come off flirtatious to others. Even her Cure outfit is out there compare to the other's outfits.
-   In _Ranma ½_, Shampoo is a beautiful Chinese warrior woman who aggressively pursues the protagonist, and turns into a cat whenever splashed with cold water.
-   _Fairy Tail_: Erza's kitty-obsessed childhood friend Milliana began sporting an extremely revealing outfit and sexy attitude after she went through adolescence during the first Time Skip.
-   Aisha Clanclan from _Outlaw Star_, a member of a race of catlike aliens, fits snugly into this trope.
-   _Soul Eater_: Blair is a magic cat who can shapeshift into a human. In human form she's a woman who dresses very skimpily and flirts with any man she meets. (In one Gender Bender story where she's temporarily changed into a man, she's just as sexy and sexually-active.)
-   In _Sword Art Online_, the game Alfheim Online features a race of cat-like fairies called the Cait Sith, with members of the race bearing cat ears and tails. The only significant characters who are members of the race, Silica and Sinon, are attractive girls who are also part of Kirito's Unwanted Harem.
-   Obi in _Snow White with the Red Hair_ has a restrained cat theme and is a sexy dude.
-   _High School D×D_ has Koneko Toujou's buxom older sister Kuroka. Both of them are nekomata.
-   Eris in _Cat Planet Cuties_ is a stacked Cat Girl with no nudity taboo. When the Catian mothership arrives, it's shown that the rest of her species is similarly sexy and has very liberal ideas regarding nudity, casual sex, and polygamy compared to Japan. Also, they get much of their understanding of Japanese culture from Eris reading Kio's magazines.

    Comic Books 

-   _Blacksad_:
    -   Natalia Wilford, Alma Meyer, Luanne Eva Lange and Donna Blacksad. All of whom fit this trope to a T. They are all drawn as conventionally attractive Cat Folk, with even Blacksad himself being presented as a Hunk on occasion, like the Funny Background Event with all the boyfriends arguing with their girlfriends for looking at him.
    -   Blacksad and Weekly watch a leopard exotic dancer in the opening of _A Silent Hell_.
-   _The DCU_:
    -   The Trope Codifier in many ways is Selina Kyle a.k.a. Catwoman, a morally ambiguous villain-turned-(anti)hero and arguably **the** Ms. Fanservice of the whole DC universe. She's a Classy Cat-Burglar and Femme Fatale who serves as an occasional ally and love interest for Batman himself, while her outfit tends to be some version of a Spy Catsuit or even having her Dressed Like a Dominatrix.
    -   On the male side, the villain Catman spent decades as something of a C-list joke... until Gail Simone got her hands on him in _Secret Six_ and reinvented him as a badass, frequently shirtless, bisexual Anti-Villain.
    -   _Wonder Woman_ villain Cheetah has been this at times. Her Golden Age version was a beautiful Badass Normal woman in a fur-print catsuit with hand and foot claws. Later versions have made her a feline-human hybrid, sometimes sexy but sometimes more bestial and uncanny-looking.
-   _Teen Titans_:
    -   Starfire is a downplayed example. She's an alien whose species evolved from cat-like creatures and she's a beautiful, flirtatious, Innocent Fanservice Girl in a skimpy costume who became notorious by being one of the first heroic characters to have non-marital sex in a DC comic. However, there's relatively little feline about her appearance or personality, and the "evolved from cats" thing is rarely mentioned.
    -   Jade Nguyen, a.k.a Cheshire, is a flirtatious assassin who takes her alias from the Cheshire Cat of _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_. She tends to wear revealing outfits that show off her body and has been known to use her looks to her advantage. Her portrayal in _Young Justice (2010)_ plays up the cat motif even further by giving her a cat mask and she retains the seductive personality in her interactions with Will Harper.
-   Marvel Comics has Catwoman's Alternate Company Equivalent Black Cat, and Tigra, a furry half-feline heroine in a bikini with definite animal instincts who provides the current page image.
-   The heroine of the Porn with Plot pioneering adult furry comic _Omaha the Cat Dancer_ is an anthropomorphic feline stripper with frequent on panel nudity and sex scenes.
-   Parodied in _Empowered_ with Ocelotina, a cat-themed purported supervillainess who is basically an in-universe porn star.
-   The _Angel (IDW)_ post-show comics introduced an assassin named Dez, a female jaguar given the magical ability to shapeshift into a human. She was depicted as a Shameless Fanservice Girl with many nude scenes.
-   In _The Wicked + The Divine_, Sakhmet, who incarnates the Egyptian Cat Girl war goddess, is the most sexualised and sexually active of all the gods, hardly caring for anything except physical pleasure.
-   _Flare_ has Tigress, whose usual Stripperific tiger-print costume includes thigh boots and fingerless gloves. She once claimed to have been worshiped in ancient Egypt as the goddess Bast.
-   _Shakara_ featured a minor female character from a species of Cat Folk who tries to betray the assassin Valentine D'Eath after sleeping with him.

    Fan Works 

-   _Vow of Nudity_: In a series loaded with sexualized characters, Fiora the forest witch still manages to stand out due to her mischievous nature, unbridled sex drive, frequent and unashamed use of magic in lewdly-unintended ways, and her gray morality letting her get away with far more lecherous behaviors than other good-aligned characters.

    Film — Animated 

-   The _Shrek_ series and spin-offs portray the Puss in Boots as a Dashing Hispanic who likes to flirt with women, while Kitty Softpaws is characterized as a seductive Classy Cat-Burglar.
-   Sawyer, the feline female character from _Cats Don't Dance_. Though not heavily sexualised, she does boast a rather curvaceous body, is a very skilled dancer and is the love interest to Danny.
-   _El Arca_ has Panthy, a Femme Fatale panther club singer with an Impossible Hourglass Figure.
-   _Treasure Planet_: Captain Amelia is the most noticeably feminine character in the cast while being a member of the Cat Folk, with much emphasis on her agility and accent. She eventually becomes a love interest for Doctor Doppler and marries him by the end.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   All of the major film versions of Catwoman — in _Batman Returns_, _Catwoman (2004)_,_The Dark Knight Rises_, and _The Batman (2022)_ — were at least intended to be Ms. Fanservice.
-   _Cats_ tried this. Heavy emphasis on "tried."
-   _Star Trek V: The Final Frontier_ featured a humanoid feline alien woman in two scenes working as an exotic dancer at a seedy tavern on Paradise.
-   The famous 1942 horror film _Cat People_ expresses a major theme of fear of female sexuality in the story of a woman who (rightly or wrongly) believes that she will shift into a killer big cat if she becomes sexually active. It was remade in 1982 under the same title, and made much less ambiguous and much more graphically sexual.
-   Animala in the B-Movie parody _The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra_ and sequel. Supposedly she's a mix of four different animals, none of them cats, but is basically an attractive actress in a leotard with clawed gloves who goes around purring in a sensual manner. "Rowrr..."

    Literature 

-   _Discworld_: When Nanny Ogg's cat Greebo is at times magically transformed into a human, he is described as a battle-scarred Hell-Bent for Leather tough guy exuding enough bad-boy sexuality to leave any non-lesbian woman who sees him practically catatonic.
-   In the _October Daye_ books, Tybalt is the king of the local Court of Cats and a cat shifter. When he is first introduced, he is explicitly described as "basically walking sex appeal". Much attention is paid to how he looks in tight leather pants.
-   There's a very dark example in various works by the British SF writer Richard Calder, starting with the _Dead Girls/Dead Boys/Dead Things_ trilogy. "Catgirls" in them are the result of a human mutation that makes them beautiful, instinctive and malicious Femme Fatales. They are also intensely masochistic, to the point of seeking out and enjoying their own Questionable Consent sexual murders.
-   The were-leopards of _City of Devils_ are all extraordinarily good looking and ooze sex appeal. Unfortunately for everyone else, they transform into huge, hungry felines when they're aroused, and pretty much anything gets them feeling frisky.
-   Nyara in _Heralds of Valdemar_ was gradually transformed into a sexy cat girl by her sorcerer father, who used her to test changes he then made on himself, though _he_ styled himself after a lynx. Nyara slinks and purrs her words and is ordered to Go Seduce My Archnemesis, but with Heroic Willpower manages to resist his orders and switch sides. In the aftermath of the first book, she runs away into the wilderness not wanting to be controlled or coerced by anyone. Need goes with her and spends several months teaching her and undoing those changes that Nyara really hates, taking her more into regular Cat Girl territory.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The enhanced physical abilities of the X5 supersoldiers in _Dark Angel_ come from having some cat DNA in their cocktail, and they're also designed to all be beautiful/handsome. The female X5s experience the feline estrus cycle, going into heat two or three times each year, which proves inconvenient for the series heroine Max in two episodes.
-   In the _Doctor Who_ story "Survival", Ace's interactions with the feline Cheetah People are highly erotic and blatantly played as a lesbian sexual awakening.
-   Catwoman in _Batman (1966)_ is hot whether she's played by Julie Newmar, Lee Meriwether, or Eartha Kitt.

    Music 

-   The Cure's "The Love Cats" consists mostly of a whole string of feline metaphors for sex, including semi-orgasmic cat noises.
-   The video for the Fall Out Boy song "The Take Over, the Break's Over" features several women dressed as cats dancing seductively.
-   As her artist moniker suggests, Doja Cat employs this kind of imagery from time to time, most recently by wearing a cat-face prosthesis at the 2023 Met Gala.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   This one's Older Than Dirt. Bastet, an Egyptian goddess associated with love and fertility, is usually depicted with the head of a cat (a lioness in earlier depictions, a housecat starting around the Late Period).
-   Norse Mythology associated the Love Goddess Freyja with cats.

    Theatre 

-   While the characters themselves are less human in behavior and fall under Nearly Normal Animal, most of the costumes in _Cats_ evoke this, being tight spandex outfits decorated with tabby, calico, or other feline patterns. In addition, most of the female cats wear lipstick and eyeliner. It's especially noteworthy in the "Macavity" number, where two female cats dance seductively while singing it, and in the character of Rum Tum Tugger, who does pelvic thrusts during his song and takes a clear influence from Mick Jagger.
    -   It's also all but directly stated that Grizabella may have been this in her youth, as she wears a little black dress and high heels, is more heavily made up than the other cats, is referred to as "the glamour cat", and is implied to have been a prostitute.

    Video Games 

-   Ankha from _Animal Crossing_ is frequently portrayed as this, thanks to Memetic Mutation.
-   Yellow Iris from the little-known Capcom side-scroller _Battle Circuit_ is a curvy Cat Girl who wears nothing but a green corset and thick leather belt.
-   In _Cannon Spike_, level boss Cat Lady Beauty is a sexy woman with a cat-ear-like hairdo and a Navel-Deep Neckline, who becomes a giant cat monster when she Turns Red.
-   Felicia from _Darkstalkers_ is one of _the_ most notorious video game examples and the Trope Codifier as a whole; a voluptuous Cat Girl who is blatantly _naked_ except for some stripes of white fur that look a bit like a thong bikini.
-   Kirze from _King's Raid_ is a Cat hybrid with an Impossible Hourglass Figure, has cat-like mannerisms when you speak to her in the inn and her trascendence animations, and her default outfit is a corset with a transparent short Showgirl Skirt and high boots.
-   In _Sly 2: Band of Thieves_, Constable Neyla is a secretly Dirty Cop and surprise Big Bad. She is a tiger who wears a belly-baring tank top and cut-off jeans and uses her sexuality manipulatively, typically via betraying those she gains the trust of. There are also the Arabian belly dancers in _Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time_.
-   One of the monster classes recruitable in _Disgaea_ is the Nekomata class, a race of sexy Felicia-esque catwomen.
-   The Kasha boss from _Nioh 2_ takes the form of a feral but still very easy on the eyes cat girl. The fact that she's very buxom and has revealing clothes help a lot.
-   Ms. Fortune from _Skullgirls_ is a Cat Girl with tan skin, a slender athletic figure, and a very revealing outfit consisting of a short top that barely covers her breasts, tight form-fitting short shorts, and torn leggings that don't even cover her thighs. Of course, the fact that she fights by gruesomely dismembering and reattaching her limbs (which also explains her skimpy outfit) slightly offsets this.
-   Clawroline from _Kirby and the Forgotten Land_ is an anthropomorphic leopard lady with long eyelashes, purple eyeshadow, chest fluff that resembles a bust, and an _extremely_ exaggerated Impossible Hourglass Figure. In a _Kirby_ game, of all places.

    Web Animation 

-   _Planet Dolan_: Shima Luan is a pink cat whose buxom form is Lampshaded from time to time.
-   _RWBY_: Blake the cat faunus is noted both in and out of universe to be sexy. Her design is made to be androgynous and form-fitting to be attractive to both sexes and many characters proclaim their attraction to her. She is also the only member of the Team who has a confirmed relationship (albeit a failed one) before the series, and has multiple people interested in her over the course of it.

    Western Animation 

-   In _Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds_, a furry children's adaptation of _The Three Musketeers_, Femme Fatale Milady Dewinter is one of the few cats in an otherwise mostly-canine cast of characters.
-   In _Around the World with Willy Fog_, a furry version of _Around the World in Eighty Days_ by the same people as _Dogtanian_, Willy's sophisticatedly sexy love interest, Romy, is a cat.
-   _Heathcliff & the Catillac Cats_: Cleo is drawn to appear like a humanoid feline with blonde hair, an hourglass figure, and leg warmers. She's such a babe, that in addition to being hit on by multiple neighborhood cats, a human PR agent took one look at her and _had to_ have her for his catfood company's advertising campaign!
-   The _Justice League_ incarnation of Cheetah is arguably her most attractive design, with a voice to match.
-   In the "Divorce" episode of the Hungarian series _„Kérem a következőt!”_, a cat singer performs a song about how sleeping around is better than marriage.
-   Flora is this in the 4th season of _Winx Club_ when wearing her Love and Pet pet store uniform.
-   _Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart_: King Snugglemagne is a rare male version of this trope, being a Macho Camp lion with a foppish personality. Mao Mao counts as well, if only for his deep, masculine voice.
-   In _Miraculous Ladybug_, one of the protagonists is Cat Noir, a cat themed superhero. He's extremely good-looking, a professional male model, and a Chick Magnet in both identities.
-   Agazza from _Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends_. She's really a Vodo'un, but unlike the others of her kind, she inhabits the body of a sexy humanoid feline alien.
-   Catra from _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_ is more of an Unkempt Beauty, but Scorpia and Adora both openly show they find her attractive, Gimmer via an Imagine Spot is implied to find her extremely attractive, and after getting to know her for a bit, Bow can't stop gushing about how cute she is. In Season 4, Catra adopts a sleeker look, and wears a tight, figure hugging outfit.
-   Kitty Katswell from _T.U.F.F. Puppy_ is Dudley Puppy's feline partner who has great acrobatics skills along with a nice figure to boot.
