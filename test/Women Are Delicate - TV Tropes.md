_"A woman's duty is not to control or take charge."  
"Women's nature is passive."_

line This is an Omnipresent Trope. It can be assumed to exist in every medium unless otherwise stated. In most forms of human society, the assumption is that women are the more delicate of the sexes or are more suited for nurturing and/or looking pretty than the more active roles undertaken by men. Women tend to be physically smaller than men and possess less musculature, and these things, amongst others, have created the assumption that women are less "hardy" than men.

The Stereotype takes two forms:

-   Unilateral: Women are inherently delicate, incompetent, unstable, dependent, vulnerable, ineffectual, unreliable, lovely, precious, or sensitive.
-   Bilateral: Women are more delicate _than men._ In this form, even if women have toughness, competence, strength, or stability, it's less than what their male peers are capable of.

Nearly every medium plays around with this in some way. There are some tropes (for example, Stay in the Kitchen) which stereotype it whereas other tropes (such as Action Girl) outright subvert, defy, or avert it intentionally. From there, the combinations tend to get tricky. Some tropes treat it ironically (Waif-Fu) whereas others reinforce it by having the more masculine of two female characters be the disposable one. Under this belief, it's also commonly assumed that beauty is a woman's "hat", thus what women naturally lack in power or capability they make up for in appearance.

In modern culture it is nigh-impossible to not have some sort of variation of this trope. Only in some hypothetical, gender-neutral civilization would that be possible, and that does not describe the world as it exists today. Even if unintended by the author, the audience will take whatever tropes are used and add meaning to them. A girl who puts up a fight alongside her male colleagues will still be considered an "aversion" of this trope whereas a girl who is meek and prefers to sit down and talk will be a straight example.

Lastly, note that the word we chose to define this trope is "delicate". That word is not just about the woman's physical or emotional toughness. Delicate also means "precious, careful, deliberate, thorough", which are also qualities women are stereotyped with such as with Women Are Wiser and Men Use Violence, Women Use Communication. Delicate is the word which best sums up everything this trope is about. Please keep that in mind when adding/editing the subtropes. We intentionally chose a polysemic word for this trope because Tropes Are Flexible, and like all stereotypes, this one is an Evolving Trope and changes a LOT as people attempt to use it or downplay it.

A Sister Trope to Men Are Tough.

No Examples, Please. This page should be used as nothing except a listing of tropes which play with this in some way.

-   All Women Are Prudes: Because women are delicate, they must constantly defend their virginity and/or sexuality like a precious gem.
-   All Women Hate Each Other: Female relationships, no matter how friendly they seem on the surface, never last due to women's self-serving and competitive nature.
-   Alpha Bitch: A female character, often the leader of a Girl Posse, who preys upon other girls and shy/"weak" boys. She and her followers always swoon over the Jerk Jock or Hunk or pretend to, so that they can use him for their own ends.
-   Baby Factory: A woman is tied to her biology, and some force conspires to use her for that purpose.

-   Beautiful All Along: An Aesop which teaches guys not to overlook girls who don't conform to standard beauty... because ugly girls can become conventionally hot if they try. Learning to see an unconventionally-attractive woman as beautiful, however, isn't an option.
-   Beautiful Slave Girl: A lovely woman attracts The Hero's (and the audience's) sympathy because her enslavement makes her more vulnerable.
-   Beauty Contest: A competition to determine who will be crowned the most beautiful female in the setting. Due to how badly the women in the setting want the title, it will become all-out war. A Straw Feminist will usually complain (but be ignored and a Transgender person or a Wholesome Crossdresser will typically win either to teach An Aesop or for laughs).
-   Beauty Equals Goodness: If she looks good on the outside, she _must_ be good on the inside, too! And if she's _not_ conventionally attractive, she must be a bad person, or must have done something wrong. (Perhaps she is being punished by The Powers That Be.)

-   Beauty Is Never Tarnished: No woman ever gets seriously injured, or even dirty, except in such a way to make her _more_ attractive to the viewing audience (i.e. Clothing Damage that bares the midriff = good; nasty gash across the face = bad).
-   Bed Full of Women: A stock visual to demonstrate a character's manliness, virile nature, and sexual aptitude by having a number of women in his bed, with the implication that he managed to have sex with (and often satisfy) all of them.

-   Behind Every Great Man: A positive archetype — the noble and selfless woman who assists a powerful man and takes none of the credit.

-   Black Jezebel Stereotype: Black women that are stereotyped as having an inherent animalistic lust and moral indecency, often with exaggerated body types emphasizing sexual characteristics.
-   Black Magician Girl: For the girls who like to destroy she has a better grasp of the intricacies of Functional Magic then heaving a heavy metal weapon. This trope also helps her fit the Squishy Wizard archetype. The Lady of Black Magic is similar.
-   Body Sushi: Her body is being used as a serving platter for food, as a means of entertainment and Fanservice.
-   Bouquet Toss: Since weddings are treated as the pinnacle of a woman's existence, _every_ currently single woman will literally fight to catch the bouquet and be the one who's next in line. The one who _does_ gets ribbed about being next, or how she's getting to be an Old Maid, or she may start to think about her biological clock, even if it never bothered her before.

-   Bratty Teenage Daughter: A stereotypical teenage girl who is overly emotional, dramatic, entitled, shallow, self-centered, and materialistic, not to mention completely boy-crazy, putting her obsession with male attention over her friends and even her family, and thus needs her sexuality and whereabouts policed by her father(or other male family members in proximity) due to being too gullible and stupid to possibly make her own decisions.
-   Bridezilla: Because weddings are often seen as the most important event in a woman's life, brides tend to want things to go _absolutely perfectly_, to the point that a typically cool or docile woman becomes ferocious and scary.

-   Bunker Woman: A man kidnaps a woman and locks her into an underground bunker or dungeon. In many cases, she has to survive or escape by her own wits.

-   Compete for the Maiden's Hand: Two or more suitors engage in some sort of contest to win a noble, royal or otherwise important woman as their prize.
-   Cosmetic Catastrophe: Sub-Trope of Men Are Strong, Women Are Pretty. For men, a Rite of Passage involves something violent or tough to become a "real man". For women, the path to womanhood involves learning how to wear cosmetics and wear cumbersome feminine clothing and accessories.
-   Coy, Girlish Flirt Pose: A very delicate and demure pose to invoke feelings of gentleness in a romantic target.
-   Creepy Housekeeper: A stock female character who is relegated to housekeeping tasks for a wealthy or powerful master, and comes across as creepy due to how seriously she takes the task. Her male counterpart, the Crusty Caretaker, usually does more than just housework and is more abrasive or crotchety than unhinged or creepy.
-   Cruel Cheerleader: A corollary to Beauty Is Bad and the Alpha Bitch, this character is an attractive (sometimes wealthy) girl who is a member of the cheerleading group—typically considered the apex of the "cool club" of a school. However, she is usually superficial, mean, or downright evil.
-   Damsel in Distress: Women are too delicate to fight for themselves; they must be protected and rescued.
-   Dating What Daddy Hates: Casting daughters as either naive enough to date a person their father knows is rotten or spiteful enough to date them as part of their Daddy Issues.

-   Defiled Forever: A _very_ repugnant trope commonly believed about a woman's sexuality. Namely, no man will want a woman after her virginity has been spoiled or she has been "violated". Even rape victims have been known to believe this about themselves, which leads to horrible consequences both in Real Life and fiction.
-   Deliver Us from Evil: Motherhood draws out a woman's inner gentleness and nurturing.
-   Dojikko: A Japanese variant of the Cute Clumsy Girl that plays far more on the cuteness and delicateness. Can be male or female, but male versions tend to be effeminate also.
-   Dragons Prefer Princesses: Big powerful creatures, like dragons, always seem to kidnap princesses, usually to give a hero a prize worthy of risking his neck for.

-   Engagement Challenge: A set of rules, tests or tasks that one must meet in order to prove worthy of a spouse as their prize. The prize is usually a woman, and the challenge is either imposed by her parents, gender customs or some other group other than the woman herself. Part of the drama involved is that her feelings are irrelevant—she will be forced to both reject a suitor she loves if they fail, and to accept one she hates if they succeed. Can be gender-inverted, but not commonly.
-   English Rose: She's posh and proper, and maintains her feminine delicacy with novelesque. She drinks tea from china that's as delicate and refined as she is.

-   Female Angel, Male Demon: Angels are beautiful, kind, and merciful and thus are women. Demons are hideous, cruel, and aggressive and thus are men.

-   Female Misogynist: She believes that guys have it right and most girls are inferior (in extreme cases, even herself).
-   Feminine Women Can Cook: A delicate woman can cook because she's careful, thoughtful, notices subtle details in taste, etc. Tomboys don't have this ability because they're more masculine.

-   Good Girls Avoid Abortion: Girls who have abortions are portrayed as bad, emotionally damaged, or sexual deviants who want to "avoid" consequences. Also, she will typically be portrayed as a victim to archaic and unsafe abortion methods which put her life in danger. Even if a story does involve a woman deciding to abort, it's with great emotional indecision and torment. Just casually deciding to terminate a pregnancy without drama is out of the question.
-   Good Princess, Evil Queen: The younger woman in the weaker political position is purer and more moral, while the older woman in the more powerful position is unstable or evil.
-   Gossipy Hens: Women can't resist gossiping with each other. Usually, because they're portrayed as shallow and fickle, backstabbing and untrustworthy, or both.
-   Granny Classic: If young women are delicate, elderly women are even more so.
-   Granola Girl: A very extreme liberal, progressive Wide-Eyed Idealist who wants to champion virtually every social cause there is with a friendly can-do attitude...and absolutely _no_ substance to her beliefs or follow-through on her goals. So she comes across as overly shallow and naive.
-   Harp of Femininity

-   Hysterical Woman: A woman descends into helpless hysterics, usually during situations where men would or do keep their cool or act more pragmatically.
-   I Banged Your Mom: Mothers are not supposed to be sexual, so to suggest that they are, especially to her son, is seen as the greatest of insults.
-   I Broke a Nail: When played straight, it's used to show that woman is more concerned with her delicate appearance than the more important task at hand. When used ironically, it's used to show that even an Action Girl cares about her appearance.
-   Ice Queen: A woman who is hard, cold, and indifferent to the male hero _must_ be afraid of getting hurt or hiding a wounded inner self.
-   If You Ever Do Anything to Hurt Her...: The men in her life want to make sure she's well taken care of, and because they're not delicate like she is, they guarantee it with threats of bodily violence.
-   I Have You Now, My Pretty: The villain sexually molests his female captives. Since he is male, this shows what a bastard he is. Gender-inverted scenes, with a villainess molesting the male hero, are far less likely to be evidence that she is evil (and far more likely be fetish).
-   I Have Your Wife: The villain kidnaps the hero's wife (or daughter) far more often than he kidnaps the heroine's husband.

-   Lady and Knight: It is a knight's duty to protect and serve the delicate lady.

-   Lady-In-Waiting: The personal attendant and servant of a queen or other woman of high stature. Almost always a woman because it's assumed a man in that position couldn't be trusted to keep his hands to himself. (If the person in that position _is_ male, he will almost invariably be a eunuch.)
-   Lady of Adventure: Even a woman who likes to be in the thick of danger won't resort to physical exertion or force.
-   Lady of Black Magic: A more elegant, graceful, and often wise type of combatant, which is why the role is typically female. Also often overlaps with Guys Smash, Girls Shoot.
-   Leg Cling: A Stock Pose in which a powerful man stands in a dominant fashion while a woman (usually under-dressed) clings to his leg in a submissive, helpless fashion.
-   Lesbian Vampire: A sexy, seductive female vampire preys on women. It often serves as an allegory of lesbianism: that women who desire other women are predatory (similar to how men are stereotyped) and will turn a woman into something "wicked" that no longer has a "natural" desire for men. Or, might just be used to invoke Girl on Girl Is Hot.
-   Let Her Grow Up, Dear: A father exerts some sort of control over his daughter's life because he doesn't want to trust her to make her own decisions. Often, the mother calls him out on this.
-   Lie Back and Think of England: Sex is a "chore" she must do in order to a) make babies and/or b) keep her husband satisfied (and thus, theoretically, with no reason to leave her or cheat on her.)

-   Little Dead Riding Hood: Fragile little girl + red = dead little girl.
-   Lonely Doll Girl: A lonely girl whose only companion is her dolls.

-   Loser Gets the Girl: Two men fight over a woman, but unexpectedly, the one that wins isn't the one that gets her. The trope still treats the woman as a "prize", with the subversion being that the dominant one isn't the one awarded.
-   Loved I Not Honor More: An aversion of the Wet Blanket Wife trope, where a hero has to go do something awesome or dangerous, and she has to Stay in the Kitchen. They accept, however, that the awesome and dangerous things he does are exactly what makes him the good man that she loves.
-   Love Goddess: Almost every pantheon, real and fictional, has at least one goddess dedicated to love, sex, matrimony, fertility, and/or commitment.
-   Love Makes You Uncreative: A talented, successful or popular artist/creator falls in love and loses the edge that made them creative. As noted by the trope description, the character is usually a "she". See also the Yoko Oh No, when said Love Interest is blamed for the artist's fall from grace.
-   Madonna-Whore Complex: She can be sexy, or she can be Happily Ever After material, never both.
-   Mad Scientist's Beautiful Daughter: She's ripe for a High-Heel–Face Turn after she meets our strong, heroic protagonist.
-   Maid and Maiden: A very archaic trope where a beautiful (and important) young woman is accompanied somewhere by an older woman. This is a carryover from the times when girls were discouraged from going anywhere by themselves to preserve virginity and purity.
-   Maiden Aunt: A specific version of Old Maid; she's successful but has no children of her own, so she dotes on her sibling's children.
-   The Maiden Name Debate: In a patriarchal or patrilineal society, women are expected to take the last name of their husband, but this causes a lot of debate if she's got more power, status, or individuality.
-   Makeup Is Evil: Using makeup to enhance one's natural beauty is "cheating" and makes someone (usually women) untrustworthy. Especially common for The Vamp or the Femme Fatale, and is a Super-Trope to Excessive Evil Eyeshadow.
-   Make Way for the Princess: When the Alpha Bitch and her Girl Posse come on the scene, everyone in the school gets out of their way. Most often used as a way to affect the Male Gaze on the extremely hot girls.
-   Mandatory Motherhood: Whether she wants to or not, her destiny is to be a mother.
-   Marital Rape License: A trope of outdated morality, where a husband has a legal right and/or expectation to have sex with an unwilling wife, even if it means violently forcing her to. Sometimes gender-inverted, but that version is not as common.
-   Mars and Venus Gender Contrast: Women are fundamental _very_ different from men, _almost_ to the point of being a whole other species.
-   Mars Needs Women: Aliens are coming to earth to steal human females. Often used, whether intentionally or inadvertently, as a fantastic analog for lecherous foreigners.
-   Masculine Lines, Feminine Curves: Curves are visibly softer and more delicate than lines, which makes them perfect for drawing women while straight lines are perfect for drawing men.
-   Men Act, Women Are: Male characters get everything done, or do the hard work. The female characters are simply there to look good or to invoke audience sympathy.
-   Men Are Better Than Women: Men are more all-around capable, reliable, or flat out superior, than women.
-   Men Are Uncultured: Because women are delicate, they can appreciate fine cultures like opera and classical painting. Men, because they are brutes, cannot.

-   Men Are Strong, Women Are Pretty: The primary virtue of a man is to be strong, capable, tough and daring. The primary virtue for a woman is to look pretty.
-   Men Are the Expendable Gender: One of the more Unfortunate Implications of this super trope.
-   Men Buy from Mars, Women Buy from Venus: Advertising tries to make men's products tough or cool, while women's products are sensitive, gentle or make housework easier.
-   Men Get Old, Women Get Replaced: Female characters either stay forever young and/or beautiful, or they're removed from an active role in the story. Male characters stay involved even after they've grown old.
-   Men Like Dogs, Women Like Cats: Men prefer dogs because they're traditionally used for work and are rough-and-tumble pets. Women, however, prefer "softer" and less hands-on pets like cats.
-   Men Use Violence, Women Use Communication: Because men are strong, violence is their main method of problem-solving. Because women are delicate, they talk things out to find a solution that pleases everyone or manipulate others into getting what they want.
-   Messy Male, Fancy Female: Men (or male characters) are portrayed as unkempt or dirty to showcase their ruggedness or lack of domestication. Female characters are portrayed as clean and well-kept to showcase their beauty or lack of ruggedness.
-   Misogyny Song: A song either about how women are objectified, disposable, crazy, or all of the above.
-   Missing White Woman Syndrome: Only a missing case about a woman who is white, wealthy, conventionally-attractive, young, and(of course) chaste or virginal is newsworthy. If she doesn't fit one or more of those categories, her disappearance might never be mentioned, or might even be portrayed as a "good" thing.
-   Monster Brother, Cutie Sister: In a couple of siblings, the woman is usually the cute little sister who has a big brother _very_ overprotective over her.

-   Mother Nature, Father Science: Nature is about emotions, intuition, warmth, birth, and nurture. Science is about logic, death, cold fact, and radical progress.

-   Mystical Pregnancy: A trope which skips any number of biological steps to conceive or maintain a pregnancy.

-   Not Like Other Girls: A female character is _praised_, either by the narrative or by a character, typically a male one, for her lack of feminine qualities, suggesting that, due to being more masculine .,she surpassed the perceived inherent "inferiority" of her gender by making herself an "exception" who can stand with the dudes.

Similar to the Gold Digger, with the exception that the Pretty Freeloader doesn't need to sleep with anyone.

-   Real Women Don't Wear Dresses: Feminine traits are eschewed due to being weak and worthless, primarily because of their association with women, who are weak and worthless. Thus, if a woman wants to be strong, ambitious, confident, or get shit done, she must compete on men's terms and become as masculine as possible.

-   Rejection Affection: A guy meets a girl and tries to woo her, but she rejects him—so he tries again, and again, and _again_. Each rejection only emboldens his desire for her. She's become a prize to be won, and her resistance is simply an obstacle.
-   Remarried to the Mistress: A husband with an extramarital lover simply replaces his dead wife with the other woman. Beyond sometimes treating women as interchangeable, this sort of practice is often more acceptable than the inverse, since women often aren't allowed to remarry, fewer have a choice of whom to marry, and woman taking lovers is usually seen as the greatest of insults.
-   Retail Therapy: Shopping is something that'll cheer a woman up. If this applies to a man, he's effeminate or equally shallow.

-   Slut-Shaming: A woman who had sex should feel bad about it.
-   Soapbox Sadie: A (usually) female character who is sensitive to a huge number of plights in the world. The character can either imply that women are more empathetic to such problems, or that they are too "wholesome" for their own good. Or both.

-   Stay in the Kitchen: When a character or the narrative insists that women should only do womanly things.
-   Suicide by Pills: Women are overrepresented in the depictions of this trope likely because it is less gory than other forms of Choosing Death and because it preserves the beauty of the victim, making this both Women Are Delicate and Delicate Is Beautiful.
-   Taking the Veil: A female character becomes a nun for reasons that may include one of the following: she's trying to escape an Arranged Marriage she doesn't want or an abusive marriage already in effect, her family considers her to be "troublesome" and wants to have her Locked Away in a Monastery, she is considered Defiled Forever, she's retiring at the end of her life, or she actually _does_ feel called to be a "Bride of Christ." She will either be strictly contemplative, or relegated to a traditionally "feminine" career path such as teaching or nursing, and takes a vow of chastity.
-   Talented Princess, Regular Guy: The female character has both high status and highly developed skills while the guy is just there.
-   Tampon Run: Another one of those strange little quirks of femininity; her body always seems to betray her at the least convenient moment.

-   Territorial Smurfette: The sole woman will _always_ feel insecure and threatened when another woman is in her territory.
-   Textile Work Is Feminine: Delicate or time-consuming tasks are for women, not men.
-   There Are No Girls on the Internet: The internet has often been seen as a place where nerds come to congregate, and many said nerds do not know many (or ANY) Real Life women who are interested in the things they like. Thus, for a long time, it has been assumed that any girl on the internet was either a man in disguise or a precious, rare gem that needed to be treasured (and flirted with) fiercely.
-   The Three Faces of Eve: Females from three categories together: wife material, seductress material, and child material. All three are feminine and delicate.

-   Touch of the Monster: A stock plot or invoked image that intentionally implies that a monster is doing, or has done, rape or some other disturbing act, with a helpless woman.
-   Traumatic Haircut: Since Long Hair Is Feminine, to lose it symbolizes a loss of identity, and to have it _forcibly_ taken from her is as serious as raping her.
-   Trophy Wife: She's just an ornament, meant to serve as a symbol of her wealthy husband's success.
-   Ugly Guy, Hot Wife: One side of this trope reinforces the "Women are Pretty" cliché by having an attractive woman contrast with her ugly husband. Another side of this trope implies that a rich, powerful or successful man can have any kind of woman he wants.

-   Vanity Is Feminine: Physical beauty is delicate, so women care about it more than men. A man who cares about his appearance is acting more like a woman.
-   Victorian Novel Disease: Even though she's dying, she's still graceful and beautiful, and no aspect of the Delicate and Sickly girl's disease is undignified or "icky."

-   White-Dwarf Starlet: An older woman of show business who is way past the prime of her career, but can't accept being replaced by younger and prettier girls.

Her behavior is typically demonstrated to be self-destructive or outwardly hostile.
-   White Magician Girl: For the girls who like to heal, they have Healing Hands in addition to a healing personality.
-   Wife Husbandry: A much older man is involved in the raising/development of a young girl he plans to eventually take as a wife.

-   Women Are Wiser: Women always the more sensible gender because they are less clumsy and more sensitive.
-   Women Drivers: A popular stereotype that a multi-ton machine that can travel anywhere doesn't mix with "irrational" members of their fairer sex.
-   World's Most Beautiful Woman: "Beauty" is stereotyped as being a woman's "hat", the way power is stereotyped as a man's "hat". Thus, the thing this woman is noted and recognized for, that sets her apart, is her physical beauty.

-   Yamato Nadeshiko: She moves very slightly and deliberately, is soft-spoken, and remains at home while her husband (usually a merchant or samurai) takes care of the everyday busywork. She is the archetypical woman of Japanese culture.
-   Yoko Oh No: The wife of a musician/artist that is blamed for destroying their career; specifically, she is considered a corrosive, distracting, or destructive force to them.

    Zigzagged 

Categories:

-   Dainty Combat  
    Literally side-stepping the issue of how a more delicate character can fight, there are Deadly Dodging or maybe pressure point techniques.
-   Mysterious Woman  
    In many works, the mystery woman is a deliberate allegory to the supposed "incomprehensibility" or strangeness of women. Not every use of the trope applies this, but the association is very common.

-   Action Mom: She does both the nurturing job of a mother and the awesomeness of an Action Girl.
-   Affirmative Action Girl: A woman is added to a male-dominated cast, in order to create more diversity or equality.
-   All Gays are Promiscuous: The lesbian side of this stereotype assumes that women are stepping into "men's" roles by desiring sex with women and since "marriage" is considered exclusive to straight couples, that means they have free reign to be as "promiscuous" as they dare.
-   All Women Are Lustful: The far opposite stereotype to All Women Are Prudes, with women portrayed as incapable of controlling their basic urges once they get started, while men can keep cool and collected heads. Related to Hysterical Woman.
-   Apocalypse Maiden: She has the power to destroy the world, and more often than not, it's up to a male protagonist to prevent that from happening.
-   Apron Matron: She's in charge of the little ones and the house they live in but she uses more vinegar than honey (and sometimes flat out violence) to take care of them.
-   The Baroness: Typically the militant female The Dragon of the Big Bad. Variations can fit anywhere between sexy and feminine or butch and unattractive.
-   Beauty Is Bad: Another trope that can be male, but is usually Always Female. She's conventionally attractive, but not on the side of good.
-   Best Her to Bed Her: She's an Action Girl, but she will only be courted by a man who can conquer her.
-   Black Boss Lady: White men are usually the ones in power; thus, if a _black woman_ is in charge, she's bound to be tough as nails to have earned the position.
-   Braids of Action: Long Hair Is Feminine, so to look like she's really ready for combat (while still staying feminine), she ties her hair in a long and sensible braid.
-   Breach of Promise of Marriage: If her fiancé breaks up with her, she isn't liable...but he must pay for damages associated with leaving her Defiled Forever and stigmatized. The modern descendant of this trope would be the woman keeping the engagement ring (if she wishes) if her fiancé was the one who dumped her, or if he cheated on her or something like that.
-   Catholic School Girls Rule: Just because she _looks_ like an innocent, devout, virginal, young schoolgirl doesn't mean she actually _is_ any or all of those things.
-   Caught Coming Home Late: A husband sneaks home after doing some sort of activity his wife disapproves of and thinks he's gotten away with it until he hits the light switch and she's standing in wait.

-   Chastity Dagger: A woman with a hidden dagger under her garments to defend herself from Attempted Rape.
-   Cool Old Lady: Just because she's getting older doesn't mean she's slowing down!

-   Double Standard Rape: Female on Male: Same as Double Standard: Abuse, Female on Male except regarding rape.

-   Hairy Girl: She's hairy, which makes her unusual for women who are usually smoother and softer.
-   Her Heart Will Go On: Her Love Interest (usually male) is killed off, and she uses her grief to move on with her life. Contrast the Disposable Woman, who is usually killed off to start an adventure, while this trope usually happens at the end.

-   Lady of War: An Action Girl with the flourish and poise of a Proper Lady.
-   Lipstick-and-Load Montage: Before she goes out and does something badass, she gets dressed and made up for the occasion in an epic fashion

-   Magical Girl: This genre of Japanese animation zigzags on the type of heroine which fits the style. Traditionally, Magical Girl heroines wielded femininity as the source of their power.

-   Sexist Used Car Salesman: Either played straight to demonstrate how clueless women are about anything outside of their "scope" or used to demonstrate the exact opposite.
-   She-Fu: The more slender and delicate woman can perform more acrobatic maneuvers. Necessary, because she usually can't take a punch.
-   She Is the King: A female monarch or head of state takes a masculine title such as "Emperor" so that she is seen as an equal to her male predecessors or contemporaries.
-   Short Tank: Her attempt at being feminine is genuinely cute.
-   Silk Hiding Steel: The woman _unofficially_ in charge by using subtlety and indirect influence. She's likely also a Proper Lady.
-   Silver Vixen: Aging is not considered by most people to be attractive, so she breaks the norm by being sexual and having sex appeal well into her old age.

-   Unkempt Beauty: Related trope to Makeup Is Evil, Beauty Is Bad, and Vanity Is Feminine, a woman that foregoes wearing any makeup, beauty products, or elaborate hairstyles. Often, she is regarded as more "genuine", less "deceptive", or more practical than other women. But, since women are expected to be pretty, she still manages to please onlookers.
-   Vasquez Always Dies: The less delicate/more tough a woman is, the more likely she is to die/be killed by someone. The converse is also true.
