**Makoto:** Nagisa, \[Rin\] called you a loser!  
**Nagisa:** Ay yo, homeboy looks like Shark Week, I ain't messin' with that.

A character smiles, and it is revealed that his or her teeth are... disturbing.

This trope manifests in myriad ways, from teeth being all askew to being rotten, from being a mouthful of sharp fangs to metallic prostheses, and sometimes even there not being any teeth at all (cute in an infant, disturbing in an adult).

This trope works for a variety of reasons. One of the biggest is that trauma to the teeth is a Primal Fear for most people. Also, teeth are very much associated with youth, vigor and hygiene, so nasty teeth instantly give an image of sickness, dirtiness and malevolence. Sharp, fanged teeth are an universal identifier of a predator, too, so anyone who sees fangs or a maw full of sharp teeth will instantly feel threatened.

Can be an indicator of an evil character, although good ones aren't disqualified (though even the good characters with teeth like this will typically still have some bestial, brutish traits).

Related to Tombstone Teeth, and Fangs Are Evil. Sub-Trope to Monster Mouth. Super-Trope to both More Teeth than the Osmond Family and Jagged Mouth, where the teeth seem to be rigid extensions of whatever passes for the lips.

-   In one of ABC's Saturday Morning Bod Squad PSAs, a character called the Yuck Mouth shows the result of not taking care of your teeth, as he has only a few teeth left in his mouth, and one of them is severely rotted.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Black Butler_: Sebastian's true form has a mouthful, and he stills shows them sometimes in his butler guise.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Arlong and Hody Jones. Justified as they're both shark fishmen (a sawshark and a great white shark respectively).
    -   Anyone can have these whenever they're angry or irritated at something (usually Luffy). Mostly Played for Laughs.
    -   Of the Doflamingo Family, Dellinger shows these during his fight with Ideo revealing he is a fishman of fighting fish descent.
    -   Losing his mask reveals that Jack the Drought has these, due to being a fishmash.
    -   The half-mermaid Charlotte Praliné also has these, and it's justified as her father is said to have been a hammerhead shark merman.
    -   Charlotte Katakuri has a mouth full of fangs under his scarf. It's unclear if it's hereditary (many of his siblings are Half Human Hybrids), but he hides it because of past mockery. His two triplet brothers, Daifuku and Oven, don't have those though.
-   Viral from _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ is a shark-type Beastman with feline genetics, and has the choppers to match.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Kisame Hoshigaki has pointed teeth, among other shark-like characteristics. Other members of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist also have such teeth, though unlike Kisame they usually look like normal humans in all other respects. And Kisame is the most prominent example because he has far more screen time than all of the others.
    -   When Naruto initially taps into his Jinchūriki powers, his teeth — particularly his canine teeth — start changing into fangs.

-   Gyro Zeppelli in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Steel Ball Run_ is a rare protagonist example. His teeth are metallic and have "Go! Go! Zeppelli!" engraved on them. Most of the time his teeth are drawn normally, but when he throws a mischievous smile, the engravings can be seen, which can be a little jarring.
-   The titular character of _Soul Eater_ and Giriko both have mouths entirely full of pointed teeth, neither of which is ever commented on.
-   Emperor Ganishka from _Berserk_ looks like an Indian Santa Claus with a bear trap for a mouth.
    -   Protagonist Guts goes into this territory himself whenever he is baring his teeth.
-   Rin Matsuoka from _Free!_ has pointed teeth for some reason (as a child he only had Cute Little Fangs). It's because his representative animal in the series is a shark, but in-universe no explanation is given.
-   Moral from _Hamatora_ has shark-like teeth.
-   Nanana from _Bleach_ has regular-shaped teeth, but they're colored black and gold (in a checkered pattern).
-   _Kubera_: Despite looking almost entirely human, Yuta actually has rows on rows of teeth in his mouth. We get an even clearer picture when we see Yuta hide Leez in his sura-form mouth to protect her from a hail of energy blasts. After their attacker leaves, Yuta anxiously wants Leez to come out but she's remarkably casual about getting stuffed into a mouth full of sharp, pointed teeth. She even cuts herself while climbing out but manages to keep her reaction to mild surprise/interest, going to show how hard she's trying to show she trusts her friend.
-   Yoichi Hiruma from _Eyeshield 21_ has these, and there's no in-universe explanation for them.
-   _My Hero Academia_:
    -   Eijiro Kirishima has shark-like teeth, to fit with how his entire body gets sharp-edged whenever he uses his Hardening quirk.
    -   The villain Moonfish really takes the cake as this is his Quirk. Specifically it's known as "Blade-Tooth" and lets him grow and control his teeth, with his preferred usage making LONG branching sharp fangs to stab people and move around with them. Combined with him being a Ax-Crazy death row inmate who may be a I Am a Humanitarian, and you got some very scary teeth.
    -   One of All For One's old customers had a monstrous set of teeth as his Quirk. He, however, recieved scorn for this to the point of being disowned by his parents, causing him to seek All For One's aid to remove them in exchange for loyalty.
-   Hawk from _Goemon Ishikawa's Spray of Blood_ has large metal teeth that would make Jaws proud. He rarely smiles, but when he does the effect is very intimidating.
    -   Chlo, an assassin from _Lupin III: Part 5_, which is part of the same franchise, has filed teeth that can chew through metal. She even manages to catch Goemon's sword in _her mouth_.
-   Hime Mishiro from _Mishiro-san to Yamada-kun_ has a mouth full of sharp teeth. They aren't pointed out too often, but it's revealed that a fair number of people find them unattractive (alongside her eyes, which combined with her teeth make her look a bit shark-like), and it upsets her when she hears people say it, though her friends don't think so. It's eventually revealed she inherited them from her mother. Presumably, people can just look like that naturally in this universe.
-   Helga's mouth in _How to Treat a Lady Knight Right_ looks like a miniature bear trap. This does not in any way detract from her role as a Shrinking Violet.
-   Misago from _Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou_ is a mermaid-like being that has a hard time making friends despite being kind, loving and good-natured because she has shark-like teeth. She actually is carnivorous, but the only flesh she eats is fish.
-   Hitomi from _Hitomi-chan Is Shy with Strangers_ is drawn with this kind of teeth to emphasize her misleadingly scary face.
-   Frederica and Garfiel from _Re:Zero_ have such teeth. Subaru once noted that Frederica would probably be a really pretty woman if she didn't have teeth like that. Both have such teeth because they are hybrids of humans and beastmen. Despite the creepy teeth, both are good guys, even if Garfiel isn't always the nicest.

-   _ST☆R: Strike it Rich_: Ichika is drawn with shark-like teeth to emphasis the fact she is a rude Dirty Cop.
-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_: Rin Baio's teeth are shown to be sharp and pointed, not unlike a shark. This is in stark contrast to her general demeanor of a refined, if sheltered, young girl. Her teeth only really become apparent when her Nightmare Fetishism is triggered, as she smiles widely and sharply at the sight of anything sufficiently violent.

Because of this, kissing (as humans understand it) and oral sex are not a custom in his culture, and he's initially horrified when he realizes that Obi-Wan seems to be moving his mouth towards his penis... until he discovers just what his lover can do with his mouth. Cody later declares the experience to be even better than chocolate and strawberries.
-   Subverted in _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_ by Mattagandas Bullslayer. He's got creepy pointed teeth that make the four uncomfortable, but they also feel he's being straight with them.

Most Don Bluth villains, such as Drake, Carface, or Jenner, wear big, toothy grins most of the time and tend to snap their jaws as they speak.

    -   If his slightly insulting behavior at the beginning of _The Fellowship of the Ring_ hasn't suggested to you that Saruman might be a bad guy, his rather filthy teeth (compared to Gandalf's fairly healthy ones) really ought to have. They are, in fact, Christopher Lee's natural set, but they are made more pronounced by making his otherwise white beard dark around his mouth.
    -   When the Mouth of Sauron appears in _The Return of the King_, his helmet covers up every part of his face except for his mouth, which often grins with elongated, pointy teeth covered in black ichor. Eugh. Special effects trickery was used to enlarge the actor's mouth to make it look even more freaky and uncanny. It is strongly implied that the reason the Mouth's teeth are so horrible is because hundreds of years of repeating Sauron's evil words was enough to rot his mouth and teeth.

-   The book _In A Dark, Dark Room_, by Alvin Schwartz of _Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark_ fame, features a retelling of a classic horror story simply titled "The Teeth." In the tale, a young boy asks a stranger for the time; the stranger then smiles to reveal a mouth full of teeth three inches long (for comparison, the average human tooth is a little more than half-an-inch long). The boy runs for it, only to encounter other strangers who, in a case of Serial Escalation, show longer and _longer_ teeth (to the point where the third man's teeth are about an entire foot in length).

It's played more straight with the elderly royal adviser Muzu, whose teeth are more spaced out due to age in a way that gives them an appearance similar to an angler fish's, and who starts off with a brusque personality and an intense prejudice against Hylians.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_, the Zonai, a race of long-snouted Beast Men, have sharp, carnivorous teeth. Much like with the Zora, the "scary" part is usually deemphasized due to the Zonai characters we see being very benevolent, but Rauru's enraged teeth-baring when Ganondorf mocks him over the murder of his wife Sonia shows how they _can_ look intimidating when the situation calls for it.

    -   Empress Siren's teeth are all pointy triangles.

-   Kazuichi Soda from _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_ has a set of jagged teeth. They might be natural, or he might have filed them himself in order to look intimidating.

    Webcomics

-   Domestic dogs, with their cute wet noses and wagging tails, also have incisors and sharp, outward-pointing canine teeth that can really scare people, especially those who fear dogs, when they snarl or even just grimace or grin. Even "toy" breeds such as Chihuahuas have this. This is rarely used in fiction except with Hellhounds and Mr. Muffykins.
-   Pretty much any animal in the order Carnivora has these. Even the ones that rarely eat meat at all, like pandas, still have fairly sharp canines.
-   Sharks are the living version of this trope. Certain species can have hundreds of teeth in their mouth at once. Sharks regularly lose their teeth, but they are constantly regrowing and replacing their teeth, so they never run out. A single shark can produce many thousands of teeth over its lifetime.
-   Even though they’re not technically teeth, the sharp beak of Dunkleosteus was designed to slice through armor and bone, and they constantly sharpened themselves by rubbing together. Just take a look.<small>◊</small>
-   Thylacoleo, an extinct carnivore related to wombats, had teeth similar to both its relatives that also vaguely resembled the beak of the aforementioned Dunkleosteus. However, Thylacoleo's teeth were made for hunting, and was speculated to act like a guillotine.
-   Basal cetaceans, such as Pakicetus, had rows of sharp teeth similar to a shark's.
    -   Modern toothed cetaceans aren't much better.
