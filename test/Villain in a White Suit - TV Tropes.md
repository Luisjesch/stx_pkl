With that suit, he's got nothing to hide about his crimes.

Villains who are in management positions, such as mob bosses and aristocrats, can often be found wearing formal clothing. Wearing bright white suits draws a stark contrast against their villainy, just as their display of culture and wealth contrasts against the teams of low-brow grunts who enforce their will.

Due to their role in the organization (near, if not at the top), these characters tend not to be very hands-on, planning things out and ordering mooks to carry out the plans. During a Mob-Boss Suit Fitting, both their organisational skills and taste in clothing can be emphasized. Don't be surprised if the fancy suit also symbolizes their ability to beat up their own thugs. Then again, it can also be used to foreshadow their inevitable (and bloody) downfall.

Not technically gendered, as a woman in a tailored white dress or pantsuit and similar position in a villainous organization would still apply, but this list skews heavily towards male examples.

Sub-Trope to Light Is Not Good (subverting the association of white/light with Good), Man of Wealth and Taste (classily-dressed villain), and Wicked Cultured (villains with an interest in consuming and sharing high-class culture). Super-Trope to Fat, Sweaty Southerner in a White Suit, where the villain has political control of a rural area, obesity/gluttony, and a white suit (that typically needs cleaning). Speaking of baddies in hot climates—where lighter-colored clothes, which absorb less heat, come in handy—another character likely to dress like this is an Evil Colonialist in the tropics. Contrast with Evil Wears Black (villainy is associated with black clothing) and Fashion-Victim Villain (villains with flamboyantly bad/weird taste in clothing).

See also The Rich Have White Stuff, where characters are shown to be rich by having possessions (including homes and clothing) ostentatiously white. Can lean towards White Is Pure when the villain is obsessed with keeping their suit clean.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Bleach_ tends to associate the color white with evil or at least antagonistic forces. Byakuya was the main antagonist for most of the Soul Society arc and, as with the other Gotei 13 Captains (most of which were antagonists as well during this arc) wore a white haori over his black Shinigami uniform. Sōsuke Aizen and his cohorts all wear variations of fancy-looking all-white clothing in contrast to the dark uniforms of the Gotei 13. The Wandenreich, the villains of the final arc, also wear all-white uniforms.

-   _Sherlock Hound_: Sherlocks criminal Nemesis Moriarty wears an all white suit with cape.

    Comic Books

-   Wilson Fisk (a.k.a. the Kingpin) from _Spider-Man_, _Daredevil_, and other _Marvel Universe_ comics usually appears in a white blazer or business suit. It's used to reinforce his Villain with Good Publicity status in-universe.
-   _The Ultimates_: Gregory Stark, the older twin brother of Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, wears a white suit, and is described as having his brother's genius, and none of his morals.

-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: Angle Man was originally a thief with ties to organized crime who wore a light suit and matching fedora, before being suited up in green spandex in the Silver Age. He returned to his white suit and fedora and became a Gentleman Thief Post-Crisis.

-   _X-Men_: Arcade's fashion style is nothing if not consistent. From his first appearance to this day he's worn white zoot suits exclusively. That, compounded with the fact that he's a Psycho for Hire and the inventor of Murderworld, makes it this trope.

    Film — Animated 

-   _Coco:_ The Big Bad, Ernesto De La Cruz, the Hidden Villain who killed his partner Hector, the protagonist Miguel's great-great-grandfather, and stole his songs, wears a shining white suit with a matching sombrero.
-   _Frozen (2013)_: Hans wears a blazer atop otherwise blue inner vestments, as well as distinctive white gloves and a full-white suit during Elsa's coronation party.

-   Lex Luthor, the wealthy criminal mastermind in _Superman: Doomsday_, spends most of the movie in an all-white suit.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Rory Gaines from _Blackjack (1998)_ wears a white tuxedo suit throughout the film, including when carrying out hits and attacking the hero, Jack, in the final battle. For the latter, it proves problematic because Jack has an Absurd Phobia of the colour white owing to having a flash grenade detonating before his face in the opening scene.

It also sets up a gag where Lucien saws through the wood panels of the outhouse, causing Vanderbrouck to fall through them. When they fish him out, Vanderbrouck's formerly white suit is covered in human waste.
-   Big Daddy, a plantation owner from _Django Unchained_, is seen wearing a pretty nice white suit.

-   In _Eat A Bowl Of Tea,_ the wife has an affair with a Smug Snake who wears a white suit — probably to show how flashy he is.
-   _Gate of Flesh_: In this film set in the rubble-strewn slums of Tokyo soon after the end of World War II, Ishii the crime boss strolls around in a crisp white suit.

She's a mob boss, the head of the yakuza, and a polite, dignified, yet ruthless leader who makes herself scarce when combat begins, only reappearing once all her minions have been killed.
-   _The Ladykillers (2004)_: Caper Crew leader Professor Dorr wears a fine white suit in several scenes, adding to his Southern Gentleman appearance.

-   _Pacific Rim: Uprising_: Liwen Shao is introduced as a coldly imperious corporate executive in an elegant white suit, who refuses a handshake and exploits a tragedy to promote her business. Subverted when she joins forces with the protagonists to help save the world from the _actual_ villain and defrosts a bit.
-   _Pitfall (1962)_: An ominous fellow in the white suit stalks the protagonist, an unfortunate miner. The villain's crisp, neat suit stands in dramatic contrast to the filth and dirt and sweaty, desperate people that surround him in Japanese mining country. He gets away with multiple murders.

-   Most of John Woo's villains, who tend to be mob bosses, (Shing from _A Better Tomorrow_, Ko Ying Pui from _A Better Tomorrow II_, and Mr. James Wong from the game _Stranglehold_ among others) wear white, the better to show off the blood from the bullets they receive. The main heroic Woo example, of course, is Ah Jong from the final showdown of _The Killer (1989)_ (though then again, he is the one out of the two heroes of the movie to die.)
-   _Hobo With a Shotgun_: The main antagonist of this iconic grindhouse film wears a white suit with black shirt and white tie.

    Literature

-   In the books of _The Lord of the Rings_, the wizard Saruman continued to wear white robes after his Face–Heel Turn; however, by the time of the War of the Ring, he had exchanged the white robe for a rainbow-colored one and called himself "Saruman of Many Colours". It kinda almost still counts because the robe still looks white at a glance; Gandalf has to look a little more carefully before he notices the weird visual effect that the multicolored weave has. After Saruman's fall from power, when he's encountered as a beggar, such clothes as he has left are "rags of grey or dirty white".

His subordinate Gelmund wears a similar white ensemble and was the one tasked by Clayman in creating a puppet Demon Lord to rule the Forest of Jura, which involved manipulating and slaughtering the monster races there without a care in order to literally feed the growth of the Orc Disaster, himself a manipulated being who just wanted to save his people from a famine. This in turn ends up foreshadowing the white-clad Yuuki Kagurazaka as a villain, who is in fact the man Clayman himself is working for.

-   Jim Moriarty of _Sherlock_ dresses in a white suit at one point in _The Reichenbach Fall_, ironically clothed in the Western color of purity and virtue, when he is in fact a complete psychopath who's rotten to the core.

-   Various Bad Future episodes of _Smallville_ show President Evil future-Lex in a pure white suit. Combine this with the black-gloved right hand and the effect is really unsettling.
