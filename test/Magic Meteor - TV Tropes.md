Asteroids Power Up!

**Hego:** It began when we were children. Lady Fate came a-knockin', and she knocked hard.  
**Kim:** What was that?  
**Hego:** A glowing, rainbow-colored comet that gave each of us special powers.

A certain type of Applied Phlebotinum in giving powers. Here new superpowers come from above, literally. A meteor falling from the sky gives powers to a person. Either they're hit by it or exposed to it in some way.

For religious imagery, sometimes this meteor is actually Wormwood, a falling star in the Book of Revelation. For a Historical In-Joke, it may be The Tunguska Event.

Compare Thunderbolt Iron, where meteor ore is forged into a weapon. Should not be confused with Colony Drop or Meteor-Summoning Attack, which cover (among other things) conjuring meteorites with magic and dropping them as an attack.

    Literature 

-   In _The Colour Out of Space_, the titular "colour" comes to earth in a meteor. Unlike most examples, it's not even remotely beneficial it slowly drains the life out of animal and plant life, which eventually turns grey and crumbles to dust.
-   In _Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn_, the magic sword Thorn was made from a meteor that, according to legend, struck a temple that God disapproved of.

-   "Trucks" (and its film adaptation _Maximum Overdrive_) uses a meteorite as an excuse for trucks coming to murderous life.
-   This is the entire foundation of the _Wold Newton Family_, a massive case of Canon Welding by Philip José Farmer. In 1795, a meteor struck outside Wold Newton, Yorkshire. In our world, it was just another meteorite with no particular unusual properties (the stone can today be seen at the Natural History Museum in London). However, Farmer proposed a scenario where radiation from the meteorite changed the reproductive DNA of the passengers of a passing carriage. As such, their offspring were gifted with unusual levels of intellect and/or strength, resulting in extraordinary individuals such as Doc Savage, Tarzan, Sherlock Holmes, The Shadow and other iconic characters from early science-and pulp fiction.

    Live-Action TV

-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: The fall of a mysterious meteor is witnessed by King Gil-galad in Lindon and it subsequently comes down in Rhovanion near the Harfoots' camp. There it turns out to actually be a mysterious man with powerful magical abilities.
-   _Power Rangers: Dino Thunder_:
    -   It turns out that the meteor that killed the dinosaurs was one of these. Presumably, it _would_ have given them superpowers had it not destroyed their entire ecosystem first with the impact. Pieces of it are the Mineral MacGuffin that give the Rangers their powers.
    -   A later meteor wackily rearranges the Rangers' personalities. Trent seems normal when affected by it, but the next time the White Ranger powers overtake him, he remains himself and helps the other Rangers defeat the Monster of the Week. It doesn't last.
-   _Raising Dion_: Years before the events of the series, a meteor shower interfacing with an Aurora Borealis in Iceland gave everybody who was there to watch it powers, including Dion's father Mark.

-   The meteor that starts Ness' adventure in _EarthBound (1994)_. Not only is the time traveler Buzz Buzz riding in it, but the meteor contains a material needed for time travel, which makes sense in retrospect.
-   Since the Zodiacs of _Etrian Odyssey III: The Drowned City_ gain their magical abilities through studying the stars, it's hardly surprising they can learn a Meteor spell. Simply learning it takes a lot of investment, however, and the spell itself is the most expensive one they can learn.
-   In _Final Fantasy VII_, if Sephiroth lived to see his gigantic rock crash into the Planet, the massive damage it would cause would have granted him the powers of a god. This trope is only averted because the heroes stopped him.
-   In _Gadget: Past as Future_, several devices in the Empire are powered by a meteoric ore that seems to provide near-infinite energy. But it also causes strange hallucinations when used in the Sensorama. The tie-in novel _The Third Force_ explains that the ore emits a strange radiation that distorts time.
-   The Temsik Meteor from _Ghost Trick_:
    -   **You die next to it**: Your spirit gains super powers like telekinesis, teleport-swapping similarly-shaped objects, the ability to instantly travel anywhere via telephone lines or the ability to turn back time for brief periods.
    -   **You are _killed_ by it**: Additionally to the former, your body turns immortal and indestructible by being timelocked at the moment of your death, but you are unable to feel any kind of sensation, exhaustion or pain and can leave and reenter the body at will.
-   The Chaos Comet from _Illusion of Gaia_ apparently gives off a type of magical radiation. Being bathed in the comet's light had been known to give people anything from psychic powers to horribly mutating them into demons. At one point, it's mentioned that "The Ancients" had enough understanding of the comet's powers to outright create living things, like camels and the Dark and Light Knights. The comet also ended up causing these civilizations to fall, since "evolving too fast brings destruction". It seems to return once every 800 years, however.
-   In _Inazuma Eleven 2_, the superhuman abilities of the supposedly alien members of Aliea Academy are actually the result of exposure to a glowing space rock called the Aliea Meteorite.
-   The plot of _Inca II_ is kicked off by an asteroid entering the solar system that contains an enormous energy source. The majority of the game is centered on El Dorado finding a way to destroy this asteroid before Aguirre uses its energy to expand his reign.
-   The cause behind all the trouble in _Maniac Mansion_.
-   Meteor G from _Mega Man Star Force 3_. While it doesn't grant powers directly, the Noise generated by it and its effect on electronic beings causes some positive battle effects.
-   _Metroid Prime Trilogy_: Phazon meteors hit various planets, corrupting the various lifeforms thereon, either killing them outright or mutating them into stronger forms while eventually robbing them of their will. One in the second game creates a whole new Dark World. In _Metroid Prime 3: Corruption_, these "meteors" are actually giant living creatures called Leviathans.
-   The early Penvellyn alchemists from _Nancy Drew: The Curse of Blackmoor Manor_ believed that a meteor found by their ancestor had magical powers. More recent generations may not have believed this but kept up the tradition of guarding it as a family secret.
-   In _Pokémon Sword and Shield_, Dynamaxing is powered by energy radiated from what's called Wishing Stars, which true to their name are meteors. One drops right in front of the player and Hop near the beginning of the story and the fragments are used to make their dynamax bands just like everyone else's. It's eventually revealed the Wishing Stars are actually shed pieces of Eternatus' body.
-   In _Poptropica_, Super Power Island's objective is to capture six villains after the prison is hit by a glowing green meteor. The meteor powered up the criminals, who are now running around with superpowers.
-   The beginning of _Shounen Kininden Tsumuji_ shows the game's main villain having a meteor fall near him; as soon he gets close, it enters his body and grants him demonic powers.
-   Every night in _Terraria_, Fallen Stars will crash down like meteors in random places. You can collect them and craft them into an item that will permanently increase your maximum Mana pool (which is the only way to get a Mana pool in the first place), and if you're lucky, they can also hit enemies while falling and do 999 damage to anything, including bosses that you can fight outdoors. They can also be used as ammunition for a special type of gun, and do the most damage of any type of ammunition in the game. Actual meteors have 50% chance of falling offscreen after the next midnight whenever you destroy a Shadow Orb and 2% chance of appearing every midnight afterwards and any location that has at least 50 meteor blocks in close proximity spawns unique flying enemies. The resulting meteor ore can be crafted into various items, including the aforementioned star-shooting gun and a rapidly-firing laser pistol which gains infinite ammo with a full set of meteor armor.

    Webcomics 

    Western Animation 

-   In _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, Sozin's Comet is a celestial object which passes close enough to the world to become a huge and powerful source of fire every 100 years, providing an enormous boost of power to Firebenders.

-   In the _Mighty Max_ episode "Tar Wars", it's learned that a meteor fell to Earth a million years ago and gave immortality and super strength to both a caveman and sabretooth tiger.
-   _PJ Masks_: Meterorites with special powers are a common phenomenon in the show. The first main example is the hero Newton Star, whose powers come from six asteroids that he named "Ajax, Velo, Lumino, Kino, Nova and Zihamba". The hero Ice Cub also got his powers from a supernatural asteroid when it shattered and a fragment got embedded into his onesie. Unfortunately for the heroes, the other fragments ended up giving the various nighttime villains a power boost.
-   In _Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa_, one meteor as such gave rise to the mesa and mutated all the animals.
