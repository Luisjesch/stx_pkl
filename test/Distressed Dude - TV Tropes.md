_"Look up there! It's a big, strong man in need of rescue!"_

Meet the Spear Counterpart of the Damsel in Distress. He's usually the sidekick to a butt-kicking Action Girl, always getting himself captured for the female lead to save. This may also occur in shows featuring a male protagonist and even when the male protagonist is a total badass, they tend to get captured quite a bit, usually to demonstrate their awesome escape skills.

Sometimes this trope is regarded as a product of twentieth-century feminism, but it's Older Than They Think. When classifying fairy tales according to the ATU Index, one distinguishing mark of several types of tales is that a man (or men) is rescued — generally by the heroine. While _he_ is generally her Love Interest, _they_ are generally her brothers.

Compared to the Damsel in Distress, the Distressed Dude is somewhat more likely to save himself in the end or to be saved by someone of the same sex. If he is saved by a woman, she is likely to use her traditional, feminine strengths rather than a more direct approach. When the Distressed Dude _is_ rescued by an Action Girl, it's not uncommon for him (or for another character) to describe this as an injury to his masculinity. If he's in a relationship with the Action Girl, he may be a Useless Boyfriend. This may be Played for Laughs, though sometimes the Distressed Dude will learn An Aesop instead.

The dude may have picked up the Distress Ball. If he was a badass before getting kidnapped, he may suffer Badass Decay, but if he continues to kick ass after being freed, he's a Badass in Distress. Compare Non-Action Guy.

    Ballads 

-   In the Child Ballad "Tam Lin" (Child #39), Fair Janet rescues Tam Lin from The Fair Folk.
-   In the Child Ballad "The Lord of Lorn and the False Steward", the young lord saves his life by promising to never tell that his servant robbed him; the servant turns him into a servant until the daughter of a local lord figures out how to get the story out of him. (Gender Flip version of the Damsel in Distress in _The Goose Girl_).
-   In the Child Ballad "Geordie" (Child #209), a woman pleads for her husband Geordie who is condemned to hang, convincing the King to commute the sentence to a fine. In the Scottish version sung by Maddy Prior and June Tabor (as the Silly Sisters), she doesn't merely plead— she brings all the fighting men of Clan Gordon ready for action, to make sure the King listens. In Joan Baez's version, presumably related to others called "The Death of Geordie", her plea fails. See also http://www.csufresno.edu/folklore/ballads/C209.html
-   There are versions of Child Ballad #95, "The Maid Freed from the Gallows", where the condemned is male, ransomed by his female lover.
-   In the Child Ballad _Young Beichan_, the hero is imprisoned and must be saved by the heroine.

    Comic Books 

-   _Asterix_:
    -   Getafix the druid is sometimes captured by the Romans or Goths because they want his Super Serum potion.
    -   Cacofonix gets captured by the Romans a few times and gets Bound and Gagged at the end of most stories. In most cases, the kidnappers want to give him back.
-   _Batman_:
    -   Dick Grayson used to get captured and tied up a lot during his old Robin days, in order to play the sidekick in danger and get rescued by Batman. Now, as Nightwing, this has evolved into a tendency to end up bound and stripped down to his underpants by the villain. Not that we're complaining.
    -   Lampshaded in _The Dark Knight Returns_ comic when Joker refers to "Robin, the Boy Hostage".
    -   Hey, Dick isn't the only one who gets tied up. Even Batman<small>◊</small> gets it sometimes.
    -   Bernard Dowd was kidnapped and tied up by villains and needing rescue twice within a short time of becoming Tim's love interest, once in _Batman: Urban Legends_ and again in _Tim Drake: Robin_. Even before that he was grabbed and menaced by a villain looking for Tim back in the pages of _Robin (1993)_ but he was able to talk his way out of that one with the only real casualty being his car and a few bruises.
-   A common premise for pre-Crisis stories featuring Black Canary was her saving her love interest (and eventual husband) Larry.
-   Blake and Mortimer: Professor Philip Mortimer usually investigates alone and tends to get captured when he's trapped and outnumbered, leading his best friend, Captain Francis Blake to rescue him. Though there are a few cases when Blake also gets captured and Mortimer is the one who rescues him.
-   Green Lantern has been full of this since the dawn of time, but special mention goes to the New 52 run that, thus far, has been chock full of our two leads getting captured (by the Sinestro Corps, Indigo Tribe...).
-   _Group Of 7 A Most Secret Tale_: In Issue #3, Frederick Banting is captured by enemy soldiers and taken to a top secret laboratory, where he's to be made to help the Germans perfect their new Super-Soldier formula.
-   _Rick and Morty (Oni)_: Both Rick and Morty become this sometimes:
    -   Morty is the more common target since Rick's enemies often try to use Morty against him. Most notably, he gets taken hostage at gunpoint in Issues 9 and 39, and is outright kidnapped in Issues 18 and 57.
    -   Rick gets captured by Dictator Morty of Dimension 304-X, and by his former employees of his dinosaur park, requiring his grandkids to save him both times.
-   In the climax of one issue of _Runaways_, Chase is captured and held at knifepoint by Geoffrey Wilder, while trying to see if Nico and Xavin escaped from the burning planetarium. He's rescued by Gertrude. Unfortunately, Geoffrey decides to just kill Gert instead, making it a Heroic Sacrifice on her part.
-   _Sami The Samurai Squirrel_: In one story, Doug is kidnapped by pirates.
-   Bob Reynolds, the boyfriend of _Sheena, Queen of the Jungle_, spent most of his time having to be rescued by Sheena.
-   Pick an issue of Will Eisner's _The Spirit_. Any issue.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   Wonder Woman's traditional boyfriend the Ace Pilot Steve Trevor tends to get into quite a fair share of trouble. His competence level varies from bumbling idiot, to experienced soldier, to commando superspy badass enough to be part of the Justice League, Depending on the Writer. His tendency to need rescuing, though, is pretty constant.
    -   A more recent (_Wonder Woman (2006)_) boyfriend, Tom Tresser a.k.a. Nemesis, is generally portrayed as more competent, if not outright badass. But he's still not in WW's league, and thus still needs saving on occasion. The first time Diana rescued him he was actually disguised as Steve Trevor.
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: Ronno the Mer-Boy in the Silver Age comics also qualifies, partly due to him always putting himself in harm's way just to impress Diana, and partly because, being a merman, he is pretty much helpless on land. He is especially ticked when he's rescued by Steve Trevor, despite Steve being an Ace Pilot superspy.
    -   In _Wonder Woman (1987)_ Diana had to team up with Ares to save Hermes from Hades after Hades and Poseidon reacted poorly to Athena usurping Zeus' throne and strung up the messenger of the gods in Tartarus.
    -   A different version of Steve finds himself in the same old boat in _The Legend of Wonder Woman (2016)_. He was dragged to Themyscira to become a Human Sacrifice for Ares' plot and was injured and essentially helpless and in need of rescue for the duration of his stay.
-   _X-Factor_: Rictor's first appearance in comics consisted of his being saved from the Right, who'd kidnapped him in order to use his powers to wreak havoc on San Francisco. Since then, in his two stints in X-Factor and his time in X-Force, he's often the go-to guy to be kidnapped.
-   _Y: The Last Man_: Yorick Brown frequently needs to be rescued by 355. And in the "Safeword" arc, the bondage gets... rather literal. He's also a trained Escape Artist, so he can free himself at least some of the time.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Mark Trail_: Rusty's designated role, constantly getting kidnapped or trapped.

    Fairy Tales 

-   "The Search for the Lost Husband" (ATU 425): The heroine breaks a prohibition and her husband is lost to magic. She must track him down and rescue him. Tales of this type include:
-   "The Girl Helps the Hero Flee" or "Magic Flight" (ATU 313): a hero falls under the villain's power. The heroine, often the villain's daughter, tells him how to escape the impossible tasks, or performs the magic to allow his escape, and usually both. Afterward, he often loses his memory of her and she must disenchant him.
-   "Kate Crackernuts" saves a prince from The Fair Folk.
-   In "The True Sweetheart", the heroine must find the prince, who has been enchanted into forgetting her, and break the spell.
-   "The Brothers As Birds" (ATU 451): the heroine's brothers have been turned into birds, and she must rescue them. This can range from a quest to making magical shirts to disenchant them, remaining silent the whole time.
-   "The Three Golden Children", or, previously, "The Three Golden Sons" (ATU 707): a woman gives birth to children with marvellous qualities and appearances, but someone casts them in the water to die.
    -   European redaction (mostly Western European): After they have been abandoned and grew up, the heroine's brothers are turned to stone. She must follow them to restore them.
    -   East Slavic redaction (Russia, Belarus, Ukraine): the woman and one of her sons are abandoned in the sea in a barrel, but they survive and establish themselves on an island. The boy then goes to rescue his missing elder brothers (cf. _The Tale of Tsar Saltan_).
-   "The Prince as Bird" (ATU 432): the heroine is visited by a secret lover in the shape of a bird (or he teleports to her room by the use of a fan, in South Asia). Her elder sisters learn of the clandestine meetings and plan to hurt her lover by placing knives, needles or glass in the window. Their plan works, and he vanishes. The heroine, then, goes after him, finds a remedy and cures him.
    -   _The Feather of Finist the Falcon_: Finist is wounded by the sisters' knives.
-   In "The Death of Koschei the Deathless", Koschei chops Prince Ivan into little pieces, throws them into a barrel, and throws the barrel into the sea. His brothers-in-law must retrieve the barrel and fetch the Water of Death to put him back together and the Water of Life to revive him.
-   Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen": Kay is rescued by Gerda, who, before she finds him, obtains some features of an Action Girl.
    -   Christopher Booker goes into great detail on the symbolism behind his bondage, and the symbolism inherent in the heroine coming to free him.

-   Hansel from "Hansel and Gretel" is put in a cage to be fattened, and it is up to his sister Gretel to kill the witch and rescue him.
-   In "The Nix in the Mill-Pond", the huntsman is captured by a wicked but powerful water sprite and must be rescued by his wife.

    Fan Works 

## Fandoms

-   A 30-year Running Gag in _Blake's 7_ fandom states that there are only two types of Avon fanfic; slash and trash. "Trash" being an example of this trope.
-   Very popular in the _Firefly_ fandom. The amount of fics where Wash, Mal and/or Jayne are captured either by Niska or the Alliance and need to be rescued could probably fill a page of its own.
-   This crops up quite a lot in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ fanfiction. They tend to fall into one of two camps:
    -   The nations are discovered by the public at large or some shady organization and are abducted and imprisoned. This usually leads to some sort of experimentation on them.
    -   One or more of the nations kidnaps another or several nations and holds them hostage, usually for some dark and disturbing purposes. This can be used to represent historic events, like an occupation or invasion. _Beatrice The Golden_ (NSFW, no longer active) has written some of the more graphic ones, including _Debt_ and _My Little Chicken_.
-   _The Last Seidr_: Someone gets stabbed, someone gets brainwashed, someone gets kidnapped, and all of these people are dudes.
-   How much _The Lord of the Rings_ fanfiction has either Aragorn or Legolas in danger, kidnapped, tortured, or out of commission so the other has to rescue him? Answer: lots.
-   At the moment, Bucky/the Winter Soldier is probably the most popular Distressed Dude in Marvel Cinematic Universe fanworks, but people are also fond of beating up on Tony, Clint, and Loki.
-   Beating up on Luke and Han is popular in _StarWars_ and has been popular long before Disney took over. Add in newer characters like Finn and Poe and the pile gets bigger.
-   The TGWTG fandom has been making the Critic the Distressed Dude _long_ before he got captured canonically. Mostly justified, seeing as how the fics usually also have Ask That Guy in power and that usually means no happy fun times for the Critic. But other times it's just because he's so very pretty when suffering.
-   Many _Cars_ fanfics involve Lightning Mcqueen being put in some form of danger with either Sally, Mater, someone from the Radiator Springs gang, or even Chick Hicks having to save him. One example is _Three Days_, where Lightning and the King are kidnapped in the very first chapter and spend a majority of the fic as hostages (although they do try to escape and give their captors a little snark when they can).
-   _My Hero Academia_ has a ton simply by having so many male characters. True they all have superpowers, but writers find ways around it. By virtue of being leads, Midoriya, Bakugo and/or Todoroki are the most common targets, but there are also enough “Aizawa gets captured and Present Mic and/or Hitoshi save him” fics to fill a page. Present Mic and All Might aren’t immune either.

## Individual Fics

_Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers_

-   _Chrysalis_: Niko was the only one who managed to escape the Supervillain Lair — meaning she had _three_ Distressed Dudes to rescue on a return trip.

_Buffy the Vampire Slayer_

-   In _West of the Moon, East of the Sun_ (a loose adaptation of both the famous Norwegian fairytale and the Greek myth "Cupid And Psyche") Spike is captured by the Big Bad and held captive in another dimension. Buffy has to go and rescue him.

_Calvin and Hobbes_

-   _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_:
    -   Calvin's father (and mother) in "The Return of Dr. Brainstorm", though they were asleep the whole time.
    -   Calvin and Hobbes get stuck in a Bag of Kidnapping in "An MTM Episode".
    -   Socrates tends to get kidnapped a lot - he's held for ransom by Dr. Brainstorm twice (though Calvin shows little concern) and the Super Smoke being in "Nocturnals" says that a returning character is after him, to his surprise.

Disney

-   In _Crowns of the Kingdom_, the Disney Villains capture all of the princes except for Charming at one point.

_Doctor Who_

-   Parodied in this adult but fairly cracky fic. The Doctor's tendency to get tied up, handcuffed, etc by the villain of the week means bondage no longer does anything for him.

_Godzilla_ / _King Kong_ / MonsterVerse

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: In this MonsterVerse fanfiction, there are a few times when it's Vivienne Graham who has to protect and save San, instead of vice versa as in the beginning: helping bring San out of a Heroic BSoD, and saving him from being permanently killed by MaNi/Elder Brother.
-   Anthony Darrow (male Ann Darrow) in the _King Kong (2005)_ fanfic _More Than a Monster_, after being taken by Kong. Jacklyn Drissel (female Jack Driscoll) leads the sailors to rescue him.

_Good Omens_

-   The fandom seems to have a thing for Aziraphale being dragged into Hell for some torture scenes with the option of making Aziraphale Fall. This got parodied in _Manchester Lost_, where Poor Aziraphale got it so bad we only got to see what was going through his head as Lucifer tore off his wings, which was an incredibly fluffy flashback.

_Hetalia: Axis Powers_

-   _Gankona, Unnachgiebig, Unità_: Between being beaten, nearly being raped, and being bullied all in the same night, Italy sure is this.

_Looney Tunes_

-   _Space Jam 2 Across The Serververse_: Elmer Fudd, in a state of suspended animation, is trapped in a glass box hanging from a ceiling, as part of Al-G’s incentive for the other Tunes to participate in his series of three challenges in Chapter 24.

_The Lord of the Rings_

-   _Pip-napped!_: Pippin is kidnapped by a former innkeeper and his accomplice. Since the story is set AFTER the War of the Ring, and his kidnappers are nowhere near as dangerous as Orcs, it takes no time at all for Pippin to free himself and turn the tables on his captors.

Mega Man

-   In _Mega Man: Defender of the Human Race_, Mega Man is captured for the latter half of Episode 13, and Roll, ProtoMan, and Kalinka set out to rescue him. Tron Bonne also tags along, unbeknownst to the other characters.

_NUMB3RS_

-   _The Best Laid Plans_: Charlie is briefly this when Mark Breshers, who is the real killer of his father, Philip Breshers, tries to steal the vehicle Charlie is in before holding him hostage before Don is able to talk him down.
-   _Yield_: Happens to Charlie when he is shot at when he and the team are on horseback trying to retrace the victim's shooter's tracks and gets a shot in the arm and a concussion as a result.

_Pokémon_

-   In _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, Ash has been kidnapped twice, though in both cases he was taken off-guard. The first time, he was attacked while on the road and taken captive by Hunter J, though he manages to (barely) escape from her ship on his own. The second, he was forcibly teleported to the Saffron Gym by Sabrina. He managed to hold his own until his female companions and his recently found half-sister Belladonna managed to get there and get him out.

_Sonic the Hedgehog_

-   In the original _Sonic CD_, Sonic rescued Amy from Metal Sonic. In _Always Having Juice_, though, Rosy is the one who rescues Sonic from his doppelganger.

_Thomas & Friends_

-   In _Sailor John: A Pirate's Vendetta_, the Fat Controller and Skiff are among those kidnapped by Sailor John and his henchmen.
-   In Chapter 13 of _Thomas and Emily's Relationship_, Thomas is kidnapped by 'Arry and Bert, who want to melt him down in revenge for getting them buried in an avalanche. Luckily, Rosie, Emily, the Fat Controller and the Sodor police manage to rescue him in time.

_Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)_

-   In _Turtle Kittens_, August O'Neil is this by virtue of being a version of April O'Neil, being targeted by the Kraang for his DNA.

_Transformers_

-   In _Run to You_, Starscream is kidnapped by the DJD.

_Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_

-   R!Syaoran in _Shatterheart_ when he is kidnapped and later tortured by Serial Killers during an outing with Fai.

_Yu-Gi-Oh!_

-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_:
    -   Many jokes are made about Mokuba Kaiba's frequent kidnappings.
        
        Mokuba was supposed to be there with me, but he had been kidnapped for the fiftieth time that week so his seat was empty.
        
    -   LittleKuriboh even saw fit to put together a _**montage**_ of a few scenes in which he was kidnapped.
        
        **Kaiba:** _\[thinking\]_ Hmm. Perhaps I should consider keeping him on a leash.
        

Dormant/Dead/Unsorted

-   In the _Avantasia Protag AU_ series, Gabriel is more often than not a gender-flipped classic Damsel in Distress, although sometimes managing to save himself from evil with holy water or salt from his Catholic toolkit. On the other hand, the trope is zig-zagged with Entity, who often cries when in distress or freezes in fear even though he's usually physically capable of escape due to his strength and supernatural traits. Eventually when his fear reaches a certain level he forgets he thinks he can't and just blindly runs away or fights. Sometimes he ends up rescuing his family at the last moment after they exhaust their own attempts to escape while he's not trying.
-   Mortality Holmes is definitely this. Culverton Smith tortures him with an inch of his LIFE and gloats over him while he's dying. Good thing Watson helps him out. Who knows where he'd be without him. Probably dead by now.
    -   The captured criminal reveals playing in what happened to him-while begging for mercy. Unfortunately, Watson doesn't give any.
-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_ has Snyder, an acolyte of the Light that tends to get captured by the forces of good every time he goes on his own. And it's always up to Keeper Mercury to save him somehow.
-   In the _Final Fantasy XII_ fanfic, Touch and Go Balthier gets kidnapped, and almost succeeds in freeing himself.
-   Joey Wheeler in _Ultimate Re-Imaginings_, though he manages to get himself out of the _immediate_ danger only; any outside forces he's still gotta get saved from. Like dying from smoke inhalation, being beaten up, being beaten up _again_, being trapped in a dream world, etc...
-   Prince Cor, the deuteragonist of _The Fledgling Year_, is usually quite capable and as badass as anyone, but when he is kidnapped and Made a Slave, Aravis has to go into Silk Hiding Steel mode and pull The Infiltration to rescue him.
-   Syaoran in _Reversal of Fate_ by virtue of being the one whose feathers were taken.
-   _Fire Emblem Rekka No Ken: A Story Retold_: On two occasions, Michael<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is captured by the group's enemies and has to be saved by Lyn. After the second incident, he starts taking fighting lessons from Lyn to avoid any future hostage situations.
-   Kid Icarus Uprising 2: Hades Revenge subverts this when Pit dies for the first time. At first, it seems that The Rapers kidnapped him, and are intending to make him Brainwashed and Crazy, but it's later revealed to be Pit2 in disguise.
-   In _Life Ore Death_ one member of the Injustice League escapes and attempts to redeem himself by taking a 14-year-old boy hostage to get to his father, and half the Team is on hand to help. Joseph still gets his throat cut, but his powers come from Miss Martian's flesh, and he joins the Team.
-   The plot of _Coventina's Crown_ starts when Morain's brother Errol is kidnapped.

-   In _Marc Being In A Gang Rights_, Nathaniel has been threatened by Marc's gang at knife-point, kidnapped to be helped for ransom, kidnapped by a villain, and is almost mugged, coincidentally by the same gang that kidnapped him.

    Films — Animation 

-   _A Bug's Life_: Flik twice during the climax. First about to be squished by Hopper and then almost flown away/kidnapped (again by Hopper). Princess Atta to the rescue on both occasions.
-   _Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return_ has no less than _three_ men who are in need of rescuing by a woman. Who are they? The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, to be saved by Dorothy Gale.
-   While Princess Aurora/Briar Rose is indeed the Distressed Damsel in Walt Disney's _Sleeping Beauty_, her boyfriend Prince Phillip _does_ spend a while as a Distressed Dude when Maleficent captures and chains him to keep the guy from giving Aurora the True Love's Kiss required to break her Convenient Coma and also save the three monarchs and the whole realm from their slumber, being, of course, Aurora’s parents (King Stefan and Queen Leah) and Phillip’s father (King Hubert). The Fairies have to break him out _and_ give him the weapons he needed to win his fight.
-   Since Luigi from _The Super Mario Bros. Movie_ spends a while in the middle of the movie being captured and imprisoned by Bowser, this is what drives Mario and Peach through the middle of the movie until the beginning of the climax.
-   In _Tangled_, Rapunzel's interventions did save Flynn on a few occasions, most notably during the Snuggly Duckling scene. That said, he is able to hold his ground against the palace guards, and he kind of repaid the favor by performing a Heroic Sacrifice, thereby freeing Rapunzel from Gothel.
    -   In the animated series, he's still a badass, but Rapunzel has also Taken A Level In Badass. Notably there's never any insulting of his masculinity; he usually just swoons and/ or brags about his badass girlfriend before getting back in the action.
-   Thanks in no small part to his injured arm and the arguments of his fellow "captives," Woody is this for most of _Toy Story 2_.
-   In _Turning Red_, Ming interrupts 4\*Town's concert while they’re attached to harnesses and they spend most of her rampage helplessly dangling in the air as a result.
-   _Wreck-It Ralph_: At the end of the movie, Vanellope saves Ralph from what would have been a Heroic Sacrifice.
    -   _Ralph Breaks the Internet_ does it again, with the Disney Princesses teaming up to save Ralph from falling to his doom near the end of the movie.

-   Older Than Dirt: In what may be the first recorded example of this trope, a central point of Ancient Egyptian religion is the rescue of Osiris by Isis, after he's killed by his brother Set.
-   Classical Mythology: Prometheus, rescued by Hercules — eventually. This has featured in literature from _Prometheus Bound_ (attributed to Aeschylus) to Percy Shelley's _Prometheus Unbound_.
-   Stavr Godinovich from Russian Mythology, a wealthy merchant and a bard. He offends Prince Vladimir's court when he boasts that his wife is smarter than the Prince and all his nobles combined. Vladimir throws Stavr into a dungeon... and guess what, Stavr's wife soon tricks him back to freedom, outwitting Vladimir and all his nobles.

-   In the _Cool Kids Table_ game _Here We Gooooo!_, the last hero of the Soda Pop Kingdom gets captured while trying to free the Grape Escape factory, and the party has to free him.

-   In _Trials & Trebuchets_, the party's mentor Artis frequently finds himself in need of rescue from situations such as being imprisoned in Patter, being stuck in the top of the Spire Nebulosis as it collapses, and even having his soul trapped in a pebble.

    Professional Wrestling

Accused of murder in 1-2 for daring to question the resident Corrupt Corporate Executive, stricken with amnesia in 2-1, then the defendant for Mia to rescue in 3-1. He and Maya share the distress spot in 1-3 when Dee Vasquez nearly rubs them out, Gumshoe arrives just in time to save both their hides.
    -   In _Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth_, this happens twice. Once when Edgeworth is "arrested" for supposedly murdering another passenger on a first-class transcontinental flight and once when Edgeworth goes to deliver some ransom money to some kidnappers and gets taken hostage himself. Both times he ends up with his hands either tied or handcuffed behind his back, and he has to talk to other people into setting him free.
    -   Poor, _poor_ Sebastian Debeste from _Investigations 2_. Getting kidnapped (accidentally, at that) was just the icing on the cake to a severely traumatizing day for him. Kay and Edgeworth free him after finding him Bound and Gagged in a small, dark room while looking for _another_ kidnapping victim, and by this point, he's become so emotionally fragile from the experience that the ensuing Logic Chess sequence is the most difficult one in the game.
-   Shane from _Asagao Academy: Normal Boots Club_ claims to have been one at one time.

    Webcomics 

-   Lidusis from _Black Haze_ needs to be rescued and protected by Rood on multiple occasions. It doesn't help that he's targeted by everyone from the school bullies to his own elder brother, or that he's barely even started his magical education at Helios.
-   In _Daughter of the Lilies_ Brent is briefly a distressed dude. Meaning that he's munched on by cannibalistic cave elves. After Thistle saves his life by throwing a big ball of fire at the enemies, everyone is more concerned about Thistle and that she has lost the cloth that covers her face than about Brent.
-   An entire arc is dedicated to rescuing Elliot as a catboy in _El Goonish Shive_.
    -   During which time he loses his shirt and gets tied to a pole. And he actually escapes by turning into a girl (his female form is significantly smaller than his catboy form, so his transformation loosened the ropes.)
-   In Chapter 5 of _Eons Ago_, Starscream is knocked out, kidnapped and sexually harassed by Steve the Vehicon. Megatron and Soundwave pull a Big Damn Heroes and rescue him.
-   _Erfworld_: Ansom. Jillian just _knows_ it.
    
    **Jillian:** So what if he didn't feel "rescued?"
    
-   _Erika and the Princes in Distress_: A voluntary inversion of the Damsel in Distress trope with the titular Princes, who have gone missing, been kidnapped, or otherwise fallen victim to one menace or another. Erika has been tasked with rescuing them in order to prove that she is worthy of the throne.
    -   Prince Egg-White went missing while fetching ingredients for his newest recipe, and Erika quickly figures out that he probably got lost inside the Black Forest, which is filled with dangerous and fearsome creatures. Eventually subverted when it turns out he is actually _safer_ in the forest, as the reason he ended up there was to escape an assassin sent by his stepfather.
    -   Prince Aurel is initially not in immediate danger, aside from suffering from a curse that could put him into an eternal slumber. After it does happen however, he is kidnapped by Morphine and taken to an active volcano, his captor planning to melt his body into perfume.
-   This is how OTHAR TRYGGVASSEN, Gentleman Adventurer, makes his first appearance in _Girl Genius_.
    -   And apparently it happened once to Bill: Why am I tied to this table? And where are my PANTS?!
    -   Tarvek finds that he is very popular with kidnappers due to the political climate following the timeskip. At one point being kidnapped by kidnappers and then kidnapped _again_ from the newest set, then that set chases him down again though Gil rescues him... and Tarvek promptly kidnaps _Gil_.
-   In _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!,_ Jean is rather embarrassed at having been captured by sasquatches but consoles herself that Bob is probably competent enough to rescue her. On cue, the sasquatches arrive with Bob also tied up, and toss him in next to her.
    
    **Jean**: Congratulations. You've just struck a major blow for sexual equality.
    
    **Bob**: Oh. ...Good?
    
-   Jimmy Westeron is first seen in _Jenny and the Multiverse_ when about to be killed by Lord Grallyx, whereupon Laura and Jenny fly to the rescue.
-   You'd think someone as large as Carl the rhinoceros from _Kevin & Kell_ wouldn't find much to be threatened by. But given he's a rhinoceros, he does have to deal with poachers seeking his horn. In addition, he's had a couple non-poacher incidents where he's needed rescue. The one usually to his rescue? His eventual wife, lioness Leona Mangle.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: The comic starts with Allison's boyfriend Zaid getting kidnapped, and the Key of Kings getting shoved into her skull. Zaid spends most of the comic being passed between the Demiurges, who think he is the Rising King destined to kill them and inherit Creation. It takes a while for anyone to realize that Allison might be the destined Successor instead. Allison, for her part, admits she doesn't particularly _like_ Zaid (she was just trying to get rid of her virginity as fast as possible), but nobody deserves what he's going through.
-   _Last Res0rt_ hits this right at the start of the second chapter (first if you don't read through the Art Evolution) with Slick Giovanni in a fairly intricate "prison harness", and then later on with Slick attempting to seduce Jigsaw while he's chained to the wall. No wonder he also doubles as The Load.
-   Atticus Brent from _Mokepon_, due to being physically unfit and having little understanding of the Pokémon world. In the first four chapters alone he's nearly fallen off a cliff, been tied up by Caterpies, and been held at gunpoint by Team Rocket.
-   Happens to every guy in _Noblesse_ on multiple occasions. You can pretty much make a drinking game out of all the times the RK4 or Shin-Wu & Ik-Hwan need to be rescued from a superior enemy.
-   Masuhiro, the Daimyo of the Senshin clan in _No Need for Bushido_, gets kidnapped by ninjas early on in the story. His status as Distressed Dude isn't for lack of trying on his part, mind you. He's such an incredible badass that he keeps breaking out of captivity time and time again, using increasingly improbable methods, usually killing several mooks in the process or gaining valuable intel. It's just that the party responsible for his captivity is led by female ninjas, and he can't help but be Distracted by the Sexy long enough for them to get the drop on him.
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   Lampshaded here.
        
        **Elan:** Awww man, I didn't know _I_ was gonna be the girl!  
        **Daigo:** Yes, it's a big day for gender equality all around. _(glancing at his pregnant wife who has just wiped the floor with a whole squad of ninjas)_
        
    -   And here.
        
        **Elan:** I wonder if I qualify for some kind of hostage-based prestige class by now.
        
-   In _Penny Blackfeather_, The Adventurer is captured by monsters. And chained. And requires Penny's rescuing.
-   In _Plume_, Vesper seems to consider Corrick to be this after events of Chapter 9, although he himself seems to be dealing with all that happens pretty fine.
-   In _Princess Princess_, the two princesses come across a prince in distress. He is not in immediate danger, clinging to a tree, and tells them he'd prefer to not be rescued by princesses.
-   In _The Red Star_ Marcus before The Grim Reaper. It's another Psychopomp who stops his blow.
-   In _The Senkari_, Val is taken captive and must be rescued by his commanding officers.
-   Finn's role in _Warrior U_. As a would-be bard ("I'm a lover, not a fighter") completely failing his warrior training class, he usually needs the more standard hero Harv to be his bodyguard against the psychotic unicorn that is constantly trying to kill him.
-   A few arcs in _Sluggy Freelance_ involve this. Either Torg or Riff will end up stuck in Another Dimension, or trapped by some Big Bad. Zoe, Gwynn, and Aylee have rescued those inept boys so many times! Though they do pay back the favor.
-   _Terinu_: It happens fairly often, so far being captured and stripped half-naked to a Wave-Motion Gun, stripped completely and tossed into a cell in a biological testing facility, and now basically being treated as the pampered pet of the Big Bad.
-   In lieu of having any prominent female characters, _Weak Hero_ has Ben's best friend/sidekick Alex often find himself in hot water. Two of the arc villains have beaten him up for the sake of angering Ben, and he has unresolved trauma from Ben Taking the Bullet in their backstory and suffering a long-term injury to protect Alex. Even when he tries to return the favour, such as attacking Naksung for blindsiding an already injured Ben, he ends up being overpowered and in need of rescue. The worst comes in Season 3, when he's cornered and has his arm dislocated by Dongha. The repeated losses have a devastating effect on his self-esteem, while also encouraging him to grow stronger so his friends (especially Ben) don't always need to come to his rescue.

-   In _The Gamer's Alliance_, the Sirithai capture Refan and tie him into the arena where he is to be sacrificed to the monstrous Plushiebunny. Ax ends up saving him and can't help but keep teasing him about it because usually Refan has been the one doing the rescuing.
-   A few Channel Awesome guys have been this. Linkara has been tied up twice, once by Sage to torture him with an Old Shame fanfic and the other time by Mechakara... just to torture him. Paw was tied up in a recent video and covered in blood while The Nostalgia Critic was kidnapped by the Game Heroes and made to promote their stuff at gunpoint.
    -   This happens to The Nostalgia Critic quite a lot; chloroformed and fondled by I Have You Now, My Pretty\-looking The Nostalgia Chick, drugged and raped by Spoony, having to get saved in the Brawl, and so on.
    -   Spoony himself in _To Boldly Flee_, then later The Cinema Snob. Linkara, on the other hand, was a Badass in Distress.
    -   Demo Reel wasted no time at all in turning Doug's new character, Donnie, into one. He's taken by the bad guys at the end of Episode 3, dumped in the woods to die, and then kidnapped _again_ by a Loony Fan family who kept him hostage with muscle relaxants.
-   _The Nostalgia Chick_: In her review of _Supergirl (1984)_, the Chick liked that the Action Girl/male "damsel" aspect was played straight rather than for laughs.
-   Rakion Kalsa in _Chaos Fighters: Chemical Warriors-RAKSA_.
-   _The Fate of Paul Twister_ begins with Paul locked up in a prison, until a rather authoritative woman shows up to bail him out. Lampshaded by Paul when he finds out her identity:
    
    _(Narrating)_ Now, I'm a pretty forward-thinking guy. By some ways of measuring it, it would not be at all inaccurate to call me the most modern man in the entire kingdom. But even so, there's just something viscerally humiliating, and maybe even a little bit emasculating, about realizing that you've just been rescued from a dungeon… by the Princess.
    
-   _Weebl & Bob_: The first "Team Laser Explosion" short had Weebl and Bob having to save "the Mayor" from the evil Fire Thunder Squad.
