Wait 'till he finds out this is just the pre-workout!

A usually comedic scene where an Athletically Challenged, unfit, or even just averagely fit person exercises alongside someone who is very in shape and is predictably outdone by a country mile. They can't lift as much weight, they can't run as far as fast, and their body isn't as toned. As a result, they feel Pathetically Weak or at least insecure about their fitness level and appearance and unfavorably compare themselves to the other character. If the other person is their rival, whether in love or some other conflict, these feelings of inadequacy might be heightened — fitness is just another way the other character is Always Someone Better.

Due to the association of physicality and musculature with masculinity, male-male examples might involve additional feelings of emasculation (i.e. they're not as strong/sculpted, and are thus less of a 'man'). However, it can also be applied to female characters, especially (due to Men Are Strong, Women Are Pretty) with exercises that show off the body like yoga or pole dancing.

Despite the name, this isn't restricted to gyms: it can take place anywhere people can improve their fitness, such as a lap pool, a hike, or a pilates class. It doesn't have to be one person feeling embarrassed next to another person, either: it can be The Runt at the End of an extremely fit group, or an entire group getting showed up by the Opposing Sports Team. What matters is the difference in apparent fitness and the feelings that arise as a result.

A subversion is for a buff character to _think_ a less fit-looking character is a weakling, only to be proven totally wrong.

Might be part of a Comically Lopsided Rivalry, especially if the difference between the two is extremely pronounced (e.g. a jacked Fitness Nut vs. a skinny and unathletic Stereotypical Nerd); or Gym Class Hell. Regardless of fitness level, this scene might still be a source of Workout Fanservice.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Trope image comes from _Mob Psycho 100_, when Mob joined the body improvement club at his school. Thankfully, unlike most examples, the members of the club are actually extremely supportive of Mob despite his lack of physical ability, since joining the club to improve ones self is the main _point_ of the club. When Mob managed to do ten push ups, the entire group cheered for him. Overall it carries the Aesop that people who want to improve themselves physically shouldn't be mocked for where they start out, and should actively be encouraged by those around them, since wanting to improve ones self is _never_ a bad thing.
