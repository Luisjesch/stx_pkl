_"I had sex in a public pool when I was 22."_

Sex in a pool. Why is it common enough to warrant a trope? Perhaps it's our distant amphibian past. Perhaps it's because you don't get cold. Perhaps water is an aphrodisiac. Perhaps the amount of glistening skin left exposed by bathing suits is a turn-on. Perhaps it's because there's no clean-up. Whatever, sometimes two people get into a swimming pool or something akin to it, and take part in what many public pools describe as "heavy petting". It also can be alternatively done in a bathtub or hot tub.

Sometimes goes hand in hand with Underwater Kiss. In a bathtub or jacuzzi, there may be Censor Suds (or Censor Steam in a hot tub) to keep the film from getting an R rating. Afterwards, one or both characters may do Sexy Surfacing Shot—that is, slowly get out as the camera lovingly focuses on them in a fanservice shot.

Similar to Shower of Love, where the aquatic lovemaking is done in a shower rather than a tub. Can result from a _positive_ outcome of Outdoor Bath Peeping. Not to be confused with Baths Are Fun, which presents the bathing _itself_ as fun and enjoyable.

    Music

    Play Truth or Dare  
    And it won't take long  
    'Fore you and her  
    Got nothin' on  
    But water."
    
-   Halsey: In the "Ghost" video, briefly.
-   In the first pre-chorus of the Liz Phair song "Why Can't I"
    
    "What if this is just the beginning  
    We're already wet, and we're gonna go swimming"
    
-   Implied in the Prince song "Mr. Goodnight". Don't think that just because he wasn't doing "Darling Nikki" by this point, it meant he wasn't doing songs like this.
    
    "We can watch _Chocolat_ on the big screen  
    Before we convene in the pool (yeah)  
    The waterfall'll wash your cares away  
    Already I love you, I do"

    Hey, the girl is gonna do me  
    Move to the jacuzzi  
    Ooh that booty  
    Smack it up, flip it, rub it down, oh no..."_

-   In one of the earlier threads of _Survival of the Fittest_ version three, Guy Rapide implies that he and Kallie Majors had sex in a pool.

    Video Games 

-   Implied to have happened in _Final Fantasy X_. If Tidus and Yuna didn't go all the way, they certainly seemed to have done everything shy of it.
-   Happens in the second game in the _Heroes Rise_ trilogy if you chose Black Magic as your love interest.
-   _The Sims_ series lets your Sim couples do this in hot tubs. Both in private and in public.

    -   This can occur between Geralt and Triss in _The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings_. Although their pool is really a fountain.
-   Zara in _Azur Lane_ has a bikini and pool themed skin with quotes that highly suggest she wants to do this trope with The Commander in her so-called swimming lessons, especially if her affection is high enough, given that she's practically thrusting her breasts at him and gently strokes the rail of the pool while flirting. Her sister Pola would later have her own animated bikini skin released in a later update, this time at the beach, where the Commander inaudibly tells her that Zara taught him how to swim in a Call-Back, and Pola's jealous facial expressions make it clear she at least suspects the Commander and Zara really did make love in the pool.
-   _Haven (2020)_ gives an achievement for having Yu and Kay engage in nighttime skinny dipping at the VIP beach on Chogeko.
-   In _God of War II_, Kratos can have an Optional Sexual Encounter with two girls in a bathhouse. Technically, it's more a Three-Person Pool Party.
-   _Summertime Saga_:
    -   MC's house has a pool in the backyard. Since Jenny is usually sunbathing there, little surprise that one of their sex scenes takes place in the pool.
    -   Mrs. Rump will ask the MC to accompany her in the hot tub while she pleasures herself.

    Visual Novels 

-   A couple of times in _Double Homework_:
    -   The protagonist can decide to go swimming at one point, and if he does, he runs into Rachel there. After they have a swimming race, they can have another kind of workout.
    -   On the yacht, the protagonist finds Amy in the jacuzzi at night. She invites him to hang out with her, and if the player has made the right decisions up to that point, they can hit a home run.
-   _Fate/hollow ataraxia_: Shirou suggests he and Rin have a normal pool party, but due to some poor word choice she thinks he means this trope—plus ten other people. Rin yells that she's never been so insulted by his shamelessness... but notably, she does not cancel the plan, just forbids him from inviting anyone else.
-   Barely averted in _Katawa Shoujo_. Hisao and Lilly fondle each other in the bathtub, but the actual sex happens on the floor and right next to said tub.
-   The protagonist and title character of _Melody_ go skinny dipping late at night in their hotel pool after Melody plays a concert. Things heat up really fast.

    Western Animation 

-   _American Dad!_ takes this trope into a rather weird direction. Specifically, with Stan and Roger.
    -   Stan and Francine engage in this in "Hot Water".
-   _Clone High_: "Hey, let's all go swimming in my pool! And by pool, I mean bathtub. And by swimming, I mean SEX!"
-   There's an implied one at the end of the _Hey Arnold!_ episode, "Synchronized Swimming", between Coach Wittenberg and his estranged wife, Tish, while enjoying a late-night float in the community center pool.
    
    **Coach Wittenberg:** What do you say we implore the mysteries of the deep?  
    **Tish Wittenberg:** Oh, Jack...  
    **Coach Wittenberg:** Tish...  
    _\[both dive underwater\]_
    
-   _The Loud House_: At the end of "Suite and Sour", It's revealed that Mr. and Mrs. Loud got the rest of the family kicked out of the hotel when management caught them swimming naked in the pool after hours. Mr. Loud telling his wife they'll only tell the truth when the kids are older implies that they were also having one of these while swimming naked.
-   Played for Laughs in _The Proud Family Movie_ between Suga Mama and Mad Scientist Dr. Carver the clone, much to the latter's dismay.
-   _The Simpsons_: Marge and Homer does it once in "Bart of Darkness". The cops tries helicopter surveillance.
    
    "_Do not be alarmed! Continue swimming naked! Aw c'mon, continue! C'mon! ...Open fire, Lou._"
    
-   _South Park_: The "Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub" episode. Really, the title of the episode says enough.
