_"Look, I'll tell you a story, all right? I once fell deeply, you know, profoundly in love with tropical fish. Had 60 goddamn fish tanks in my house. I skin dived to find just the right ones._ Anisotremus virginicus, Holdacanthus ciliaris, Chaetodon capistratus. _You name it. Then one day I say, 'fuck fish'. I renounce fish. I vow never to set foot in that ocean again. That's how much fuck fish."_

A character trait mostly in sitcoms, but occasionally played straight. A character gets passionately involved in hobbies for short amounts of time, before putting them aside and starting something else. May set up a series that is essentially Hobby of the Week or something similar.

Compare Compressed Vice when this is done with character flaws, and New Job as the Plot Demands when it's done with _careers_.

If the character supposedly always was an enthusiast in today's hobby rather than picking up something new, see Backstory of the Day. See Expert in Underwater Basket Weaving when the character is shown or described as being good at something with no practical application.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The manga adaptation of _Battle Royale_ takes this to an extreme with Kazuo Kiriyama, who, due to a brain injury he suffered in utero, was unable to display any sort of passion. Hence, after mastering a particular hobby, he'd discard any interest in it. For example, he mastered a violin in a short amount of time, then threw the violin away. Likewise with a painting he created.
-   In the _Girls und Panzer_ prequel manga, "Little Army", Hitomi, one of the girls who is part of Miho's tank crew, has a habit of quickly switching her focus between hobbies, and her best friend Chihiro worries that tankery is just another phase. Thankfully, Hitomi manages to prove that she's more committed to tankery.
-   Tamaki of _Magic of Stella_ can't decide what interests her the most, thus resorting to changing her hobbies yearly.
-   Chapter 60 of _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_ has Tohru trying to pick up a new hobby and asking everyone around her for advice (her previous hobby was traveling, but she can't exactly indulge her wanderlust as a live-in maid). It ends with her fueling her Kobayashi obsession into creating various works of art, much to Kanna and Ilulu's annoyance.
-   Maon of _Tamayura_ grew up changing dreams all the time.

    Comic Books 

-   _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_: Fethry Duck, Donald Duck's scatterbrained cousin, is frequently dragging Donald along on his latest interest.
-   The Joker is a very twisted version of this. The exact nature of his insanity changes day-by-day to whatever he finds most amusing. A look back through his history will reveal he's been a jewel thief, a petty vandal, a Mad Scientist, a nightclub-owning gangster handling more conventional organized crime, or an unhinged butcher of a Serial Killer when he felt like it.
-   _Robin (1993)_: Tim Drake briefly took up tennis and tried to join the school team, and was willing to go against Bruce to do so and spend less time as Robin or in training despite never showing any interest in the sport before, and then it was never mentioned again.
-   _Supergirl (1972)_: In the first issue, Supergirl has decided to devote herself to her true passion and take a degree in dramatic art. However, she never showed interest in acting before, and it was seldom mentioned again.

    Comic Strips 

-   In _FoxTrot_, the mother, Andy, does this a lot, sometimes becoming briefly addicted to the video games which she criticizes Jason for playing.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Played straight in _Adaptation._, where the plant expert was formerly an aquarium expert. "Done with fish," as he stated. He was a real person in the non-fiction book on which the movie was based. Sort of.
-   Penelope in _The Brothers Bloom_ collects hobbies as a result of her social isolation. She demonstrates for Bloom her skills in juggling, rapping, skateboarding, card tricks, breakdancing, multiple musical instruments...
-   In _Hot Shots!_, the hero's love interest Ramada is doing something different every time he sees her, from trick horseback riding to lounge singing to _welding_. She's officially a psychiatrist.
-   In the dark marital comedy _The Ref_, Lloyd rips into his wife for this (among many, many other things).
-   Kyle Clayton from _World's Greatest Dad_, dialogue from his father Lance suggests during his younger years he liked things like going to the movies, listening to music, and building model planes and rockets, in the present when he’s an angry Jerkass of a teenager he hates everything except pornography, masturbation, and violent video games.

    Literature 

### By Author:

-   P. G. Wodehouse:
    -   In _Psmith in the City_, Psmith's father turns out to have this trait, possibly as a result of his Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!
    -   In the _Jeeves and Wooster_ novel _Thank You, Jeeves_, Bertie Wooster claims to be prone to these, the current one being banjolele-playing. The events of the book see him split with Jeeves and move to the country solely to pursue this hobby, only to give it all up by the end.
        
        _Those who know Bertram Wooster best are aware that he is a man of sudden, strong enthusiasms and that, when in the grip of one of these, he becomes a remorseless machine — tense, absorbed, single-minded._
        

### By Title:

-   _Ascendance of a Bookworm_: Myne knows how to do various arts and crafts that were never taught to her by her current family because the mother she had in her previous life was really into them, but never stuck to any given activity for very long. When another character uses magic to explore her memories to make sure she's not dangerous, Myne tells them that she frequently lasted longer in the hobbies than her mother did.
-   _The Boy Who Drew Monsters_: Before Jack Peter started drawing monsters, his obsessions were, in reverse chronological order, toy soldiers, board games, comic books, baseball on the radio, and model ships. There were earlier ones, but his friend Nick doesn't remember them.
-   _Durarara!!_'s Izaya Orihara is evidentially very flighty when it comes to hobbies.
    
    **Izaya:** That's why I make it my hobby to stomp on girls' cell phones. HA HA HA HA HA!...Bored now. Stomping on girls' cell phones is no longer my hobby!
    
-   In the _Guardians of the Flame_ series, Karl Kullinane was very much like this in his days as a college student, so much so that a prospective love interest wasn't comfortable dating him because she was afraid of becoming his passion of the week, and him not sticking with her.
-   Chet Morton of _The Hardy Boys_. He has one virtually one every book, which usually ends up being very important to whatever case the Hardy Boys were investigating.
    -   Nancy Drew and her friends seem to have them as well, and in the books from the 80s onwards, Bess, Chet's quasi-Distaff Counterpart, becomes similarly distinguished by them— in the mystery at a health spa, she gets into being a health nut, in the one at a bookstore, she's trying to become a poet, and so forth. (Although writing romantic poetry did fit with her established trait of being a hopeless romantic.)
-   In _Haruhi Suzumiya_, Haruhi starts her high school career by trying out every club on campus, excelling in every one, and quitting since she quickly got bored of them. The main plot is kicked off when main character Kyon suggests that she start her own club.
-   In _Gallows View_, Peter Robinson's first _Inspector Banks_ mystery, we learn that Banks is prone to this sort of behaviour. "That was how the house had come to be so cluttered with the novels of Charles Dickens, wine-making equipment, twenties jazz records, barely used jogging shoes, a collection of birds' eggs, and books on almost every subject under the sun — from Tudor history to how to fix your own plumbing."
-   _The Kitchen Daughter_: In addition to her lifelong love of cooking and food, Ginny has had a number of short-lived obsessions over the years, including round objects, bending spoons with ESP, Turkish rug patterns, letters written by nuns, and detailed drawings of fruit, that consumed her for months and then were forgotten.
-   _Losing Joe's Place_: Rootbeer Racinette, a secondary character and later indispensable plot coupon from Gordon Korman's book. He has a running gag where he gets a new hobby every day and later is turned into a variety act by his desperate for money "friends".
-   Keladry states that one of her brothers is like this in _Protector of the Small_, jumping from great-seeming idea to great-seeming idea. (She also thinks that one of three girls that ask her advice about becoming knights could also be this type.) There are some who think that Kel forming crushes on three different boys (Nealan, Cleon, and Domitan, though she only dates Cleon and it never goes very far) fits too, but keep in mind that 1. it was over a period of eight years, almost a _decade_ and 2. she's a teenager.
-   In _Sharpe's Revenge_, Ducos goes through a series of short-lived hobbies while hiding out in Italy with his ill-gotten gains.
-   Mad King Aerys, Posthumous Character from _A Song of Ice and Fire_, is revealed in _The World of Ice & Fire_ to have suffered from a royal variant of this in his youth. He would constantly devise grand and impractical projects such as turning a desert into farmland or conquering the worthless tundra north of the realm populated by savages. He'd always grow bored with the plans and drift off to some new scheme in a few weeks.
-   This trope is Older Than Radio; Mr. Toad from _The Wind in the Willows_ (published in 1908) with his various "manias" is practically the poster boy for this trope, as he constantly throws himself at every new fad before getting tired of it and taking up something else.
    
    **Ratty**: Once, it was nothing but sailing. Then he tired of that and took to punting. Nothing would please him but to punt all day and every day, and a nice mess he made of it. Last year it was house-boating, and we all had to go and stay with him in his house-boat, and pretend we liked it. He was going to spend the rest of his life in a house-boat. It's all the same, whatever he takes up; he gets tired of it, and starts on something fresh.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the _30 Rock_ pilot, Jack Donaghy uses his market research knowledge to correctly guess that every two years Liz Lemon takes up knitting for a week.
-   Edina in _Absolutely Fabulous_ does this, in cycles of three weeks according to daughter Saffie. Phases include Japanese decor, living through a personal organizer, colonic irrigation, modern art and adopting a Rumanian baby (the last, thankfully, a dream).
-   Ellen of _The Adventures of Pete & Pete_ would show up with different passions and/or different jobs. She was absolutely fixated on each one for the episode it lasted for — marching band, woodshop, and vending machine repair in one episode. Invariably, each one would disappear after it had lost its plot relevance — except for marching band, which, in a surprising bit of continuity, was mentioned a season before she developed an obsession with it.
-   In the _The Big Bang Theory_ episode where Sheldon loses his job. He claimed that his unemployment finally gave him the time he needed to pursue his interests, but he couldn't stick to one hobby!
-   _The Brady Bunch_: Greg had sudden hobbies of surfing and photography. Justified in the case of surfing, as Barry Williams was an avid surfer in Real Life; it had just never come up during a plot before.
-   In _Breaking Bad_, Hank Schraeder starts collecting minerals while recovering from a botched hit but loses interest once he can walk again.
-   _Frontier Circus_: In "Calamity Circus", Tony is shown with an overwhelming desire to master other skills of clowning, and spends much of the episode learning how to be a clown. This is at odds with his personality in other episodes where he is happy being the advance man and shows no interest in actually performing.
-   Chet from _The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries_ is prone to this. Shot Put, Ventriloquism, Scrimshaw, Spelunking...
-   In the ITV adaptations of Agatha Christie's _Hercule Poirot_ mysteries, Poirot's sidekick Arthur Hastings is often engrossed in a new hobby that requires expensive equipment: golf, photography, sports cars...
-   In _Home Improvement_, Tim's neighbor Wilson is always involved in some strange new activity just before he gives Tim some advice.
    -   The episode _Workin' Man Blues_ lampshades it when Brad runs into Wilson at the mall.
        
        **Wilson:** I'm looking for a new hobby. I've narrowed it down to channeling Aztec spirits or rollerblading.
        
-   In one _How I Met Your Mother_ episode, Ted uses Robin's now-empty room to explore several new hobbies, including pottery, woodworking, and grilling meat.
-   The eponymous Joan from _Joan of Arcadia_ eventually developed this, as God's instructions led her to adopt new hobbies every week, which would often be abandoned by the time the mission was over.
-   Arthur Spooner in _The King of Queens_ is an elderly Manchild on the outer edge of senility who drives daughter Carrie Heffernan to despair with a series of unreasonable demands. A psychologist unwisely advocates giving him what he wants as a sort of aversion therapy, in the hope that the continual demanding will burn itself out. Arthur then ploughs through a dozen or so expensive hobbies in the space of a month, beginning each in a state of high enthusiasm that inevitably burns itself out when the novelty is gone.
-   Hal from _Malcolm in the Middle_ took up board games, skating, NASCAR, robot building, painting, and various others. Lampshaded in one episode that features this happening with DDR: We learn that he and Lois have an agreement that Hal can indulge in these things as long as it doesn't interfere with his job, as they both know the obsession isn't going to last. It's implied that these obsessions contribute to the family's ongoing financial difficulties.
-   Joyce Barnaby in _Midsomer Murders_ had a tendency to start out episodes involved with some new hobby group. To be fair, given that this usually plays into the episode by revealing other members of the group to be various murderers, other criminals and adulterers it does make sense she doesn't stick to the hobby...
-   _Modern Family_: Cam is an avid spectator football enthusiast, a raquetball player, a handbell ringer, a clown, a choir director, a theater director, and someone who arranges Japanese floral arrangements. While his love of theater and football are fairly constant, his love of all the other things can often be temporary and very much fitting for the plot of the week. Phil is also cycling through hobbies somewhat erratically like magic or ultimate frisbee or male cheerleading or spectator sports.
-   Tommy Oliver from the _Power Rangers_ metaseries suffers from this seasonally. He's had brief but intense interest in martial arts (he stays good, but he only did it purely for pleasure in the first season or two), American football, and _racecar driving_. Most notably, he actually got a job doing that last one immediately following high school graduation, only to show up seven years later as a high school science teacher (with a Ph.D. in Paleontology) who'd retired from being a successful mad scientist who worked with biological experiments. It is unknown how, or if, he ever finds the time to sleep.
-   In each episode of _The Pretender_, Jarod would engage in fleeting obsessions with an episode-relevant skill and/or some childhood item previously denied him at The Centre, taking the time to learn everything he possibly can about it. This goes along with his talent of being able to become anyone he wants to, meaning he's a very very quick study.
-   The _Star Trek_ franchise has various examples:
    -   _Star Trek: The Original Series_: Sulu has an interest in botany in one episode and in fencing in another. Also, antique firearms. The original 1960s _Star Trek Writer's Guide_ describes Sulu as a serial hobbyist, but this personality trait was only really played up in the early episodes of the series. It's even lampshaded in "The Naked Time" when Riley mentions that Sulu's passion for botany has switched to fencing. The botany hobby gets briefly mentioned again in the third season episode "The Way to Eden". The fencing also comes up in the rebooted movie. It's also used to handwave Early-Installment Weirdness, as Sulu was originally head of the Botany department, but was changed to helmsman to get him closer to the action.
    -   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_: Benjamin Sisko has an ongoing interest in Bajoran history, but the episode "Explorers" has him spending a _month_ building a replica of an ancient Bajoran space vessel and then personally taking it on a voyage. The vessel is never mentioned again (despite helping him to make a major historical discovery) and he doesn't show any interest in building or historical replicas thereafter. (Though one could Hand Wave this by the fact that the Bajoran Prophets are known to influence him and drive his focus from time to time, and this could possibly be an example.)
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_: The Doctor, deliberately tries out different hobbies in his quest for individuality.
-   In _Ugly Betty_, Matt turns out to be this. He has an MBA, "half a law degree", nearly became a large animal vet, has a brown belt in karate, and almost finished a marathon before giving up on the last mile. When Betty meets him in an editors' class, his passion has been sports journalism for a while, but he suddenly loses interest right before their final group project is due, deciding to be a painter instead.

    Podcasts 

-   in _The Magnus Archives_ Tim Stoker's younger brother Danny had a habit of this, leading to his death after accidentally getting involved with one of the Stranger's performances.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Orren, otterfolk of the _World Tree (RPG)_ setting, have this as one of their hats. They are stereotypically described as having many interests that they flit between and learning new skills easily, the latter of which is represented in the rules with a chance to gain extra skill levels.

    Video Games 

-   Testament from _Guilty Gear_, after being done with trying to revive Justice and being Dizzy's guardian after she went off to being a mother, decided to start living out life again and picked up all kinds of hobbies along the way. <sup>The full list&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Katamari Damacy_: Royal Cousin Peso pursues new interests primarily in hopes of drawing more attention to himself, tending to swap hobbies out between games. Somewhat Downplayed in that he has bounced _back_ to previous interests at times; while he gave up on his desire to become a great dancer for a while, he eventually decided to combine that with his fresh interest in becoming an Idol Singer.

    Webcomics 

-   Aki of _Aki Alliance_ drops in and out of so many school clubs that the entirety of her class hates her for not sticking with them.
-   Sally of _Darths & Droids_ is a "young enough to make sense" example, as she keeps changing what she wants to be when she grows up.
-   This is Played for Drama with Tedd of _El Goonish Shive_. According to Ellen, this is a tendency with him. Tedd is horrified when he realizes she's right as the results of his current work is too important to risk burning out over.
-   According to Roy's mother in _The Order of the Stick_, this is his father Eugene's big problem; When he discovers a new goal, he becomes utterly fixated on it... up until he gets bored and moves on to something else. Apparently, he has such a bad case of this that when he's actually compelled to see a project through, he'll get bitter and ornery. His desperation with Xykon is not because he particularly cares about avenging the Sorcerer's victims, but because he can't cross over until the lich is destroyed for good.
-   Played for Drama with Melody Faire in _The Rock Cocks_. Since retiring from the music business she has bounced from project to project: film director, restaurateur, marine biologist, alpaca farmer, state senator, etc. Her former producer has a grudge against her because she announced her retirement on stage before telling him, violating her contract. Her current project - a nudist resort in the middle of the desert - is something she's long gotten sick of but, since it's been a total failure, she lacks the closure (and more importantly, the finances) to move on, leaving the resort critically neglected and her remaining employees in the lurch.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Amazing World of Gumball_: In "The Gi", there's a flashback to when Gumball and Darwin quickly got tired of football, tennis, horseback riding and figure skating (in the case of the last one, only Gumball got tired of it). For each one, we get a cumulative counter of how much money they've wasted starting these things and going nowhere with them. When they manage to get their mother to sign them up for Taekwondo lessons anyway, they skip the actual classes and keep the uniforms, acting as if they already knew martial arts.
-   In _The Angry Beavers_ episode "Fancy Prance", it's revealed that Dagget has had literally dozens of "life-long dreams". While helping Norbert with _his_ life-long dream of performing with the Lipizzaner performing horses, Dagget concocts a new one of being "the crusty-but-lovable manager of the guy pursuing his life-long dream".
-   _Arthur_: In "D.W. Flips", D.W. decides she wants to do flips on the balance beam after seeing an athlete do it on television. When she tells Jane about this, Jane reminds her of the other times she wanted to do things, but didn't want to practice them, and gave up after just a few days. First, it was T-ball (D.W. claimed she could only hit balls that moved), then it was ballet (D.W. claimed to have weak knees), and finally, it was violin lessons (D.W. claimed she could have been good at it if her music teacher didn't make her use the bow). By the end of the episode, D.W. gives up after nearly falling off the balance beam in an attempt to do a cartwheel on it, but when she sees a horse, she decides she wants to learn horseback riding now. Jane refuses to sign her up for lessons.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_ brings us Mr. Bickles. In every episode, he has a new "dream". Examples include running a seafood restaurant, being a Vegas magician, being a playwright and being a lifeguard. These are the tip of the iceberg. With each new dream, he invests his time and money. He is usually already at work and gushing about how he finally accomplished it. A word of advice: Do not ruin Mr. Bickles' dream.
-   _Family Guy_: Peter Griffin, lampshaded in recent seasons where his family finds out they can distract him just by bringing up some obscure hobby. See also: the Petercopter and the Hindenpeter (exactly what they say on the tin)
-   Bender in _Futurama_ has been through a large number of these, though his love of cooking and folk music have persisted as part of his character.
    
    **Hermes:** Since when do you care, or even know, about fox hunting?  
    **Bender:** Fox hunting is an ancient and noble pursuit that's fascinated me ever since I first heard of it ten minutes ago.
    
-   A recurring plot on _King of the Hill_ is Bobby getting passionately, almost religiously into something for a short amount of time, only to drop it off soon after. This is justified in-series by Bobby being a teenager. Indeed, Bobby usually ends up acting much like an ill-informed adolescent would; knowing only the basics of his new hobby (if that), while constantly refusing to shut up about it.
-   _Martha Speaks_: In "Helen's All Thumbs", Helen takes up video gaming and becomes passionate about it. However, she has to give the games up because they make her see things and she neglects feeding her dogs.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   The Cutie Mark Crusaders do this a lot. They tend to approach pretty much every new activity with endless enthusiasm and put a lot of effort into it, and then abandon it as soon as it becomes evident that it won't get them their cutie marks. Some of the things they've tried include zip-lining, journalism, musical performance, and hairstyling. They finally get their cutie marks in the season five episode "Crusaders of the Lost Mark", and their special talent turns out to be helping other ponies with _their_ cutie marks. The Crusaders realize this only after they decide to stop focusing so hard on getting their cutie marks.
    -   In the episode "Flutter Brother", Fluttershy's brother Zephyr Breeze engages in several different hobbies and career paths, but always backs out at the end due to a massive fear of failure. The episode in question is centered around getting him to stick to one job and realize he's good at it. He eventually discovers he's good at mane-styling and dedicates himself to that. Apparently it doesn't stick, because in "Sparkle's Seven", he's later seen being recruited to the guard (for all of twenty minutes, just so he can fail at keeping ponies out of a restricted area).
-   _Rick and Morty_: In "Something Ricked This Way Comes" Rick gets into a feud with Mr. Needful which culminates with Rick starting a "uncursing" business to directly oppose Needful's cursed item store. However, once Rick feels he's won the feud - and the _very instant_ the business starts to feel like actual work - he announces that he's bored and torches the place.
-   Taken to an extreme in _The Simpsons_: Homer has a new 'life-long dream' every time he brings it up, usually followed by Marge reminding him what his last lifelong dream was (such as getting on _The Gong Show_ or eating the world's largest hoagie). Also, Homer consoles Bart by saying that if he doesn't want to learn the guitar, he can just put it in the closet with his karate uniform and unicycle. Bart is 10, though.
-   Randy Marsh in _South Park_. As his wife laments in the episode "You're Getting Old": "You do this all the time! First you're obsessed with baseball fights! Then you need to play Warcraft! Then you gotta be a celebrity chef!" Although that episode also reveals that these fleeting obsessions are the result of a mid-life crisis.

    Real Life 

-   Constantly changing interests are actually a symptom of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Without the novelty of a new situation or task to perform, the hobby becomes less stimulating to the ADHD brain, less engaging to the person with ADHD, and therefore more likely to be discarded.
