_"He's not a child! He's a lethal weapon!"_

A hero with all of the style, panache and gadgetry of James Bond, the Teen Superspy exists to save the world (or maybe just the kids) from megalomaniacs bent on world domination. And he'll do it all without being old enough to have a martini. Or drive. And he'll still have to find time to do his homework.

The Teen Superspy is the implausibly young agent of a secret agency. Perhaps she's been trained from birth for this role. Perhaps she's carrying the legacy of a missing or dead parent. Perhaps the government figures no one will suspect children of being secret agents. Perhaps they were just in the wrong place at the right time. Whatever the case, expect them to have an arsenal of high-tech spy gadgets disguised as typical teen paraphernalia.

Compare Wake Up, Go to School, Save the World. Remove all the wish fulfillment and whimsy from this trope, and you'd end up with something closer to Child Soldier.

    Anime & Manga 

-   OEL Manga example: _Amazing Agent Luna_
-   Hirofumi Yoshida from _Chainsaw Man_ is The Ace Devil Hunter working under the Public Safety Devil Hunters Bureau who despite claiming to be around Denji's age is skilled and experienced enough to hold his own against opponents like the World's Best Warrior Quanxi.
-   _Girls und Panzer_: Yukari Akiyama is a Downplayed version. Yukari isn't as flashy as most on this list, but successfully infiltrates multiple schools for intelligence gathering, smoothly impersonates a Pravda member to get info from poor Nina, and is the team's go-to scout in the field. In the _Ribbon Warrior_ manga, Yukari's _reputation_ is on par with James Bond.
-   _Princess Principal_ stars a team of five girls who are spies in Steampunk London, who are incredibly badass (especially Ange), and teenagers (except Dorothy, who is 20, but undercover as a high school student). The series eventually reveals that the Commonwealth regularly trains young teenagers to be Spies.
-   _Sukeban Deka_ (which also had a live-action TV series and several movies). A Police procedural of sorts involving an ex-delinquent coopted into the police force to curb gang activity in schools. As she is always undercover, and uses an unusual gadget (her combat yo-yo), it's at least spy-adjacent.

    Comic Books 

-   Archie Comics examples:
    -   At the height of the spy craze in the 60s, Archie published stories about "The Man from R.I.V.E.R.D.A.L.E.", featuring Archie and his pals as secret agents.
    -   More recently Betty and Veronica have appeared as "Agents B & V", clad in the requisite Spy Catsuits, working for a secret organisation run by Mr. Lodge with Dilton Doiley acting as their resident Gadgeteer Genius.
-   The post-_Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!_ Invisible Kid from _Legion of Super-Heroes_.

-   _SpyBoy_ is the story of Alex Fleming, a young boy who was bullied in his school and had a normal life. But he doesn't know that he's a sleeper agent, codenamed as "SpyBoy", who works for secret organization S.H.I.R.T.S. (acronym for Secret Headquarters International Reconnaissance, Tactics, and Spies), in order to stop criminal organization S.K.I.N.S. (acronym for Supreme Killing Institute). There is also his Japanese counterpart, SpyGirl. Admittedly, SpyBoy got his ass kicked when he met SpyGuy...
-   Danny Chase, Creator's Pet of the _Teen Titans_, was a former agent of the CBI... as he never tired of telling his team-mates.
-   _The Beano_ has Dangerous Dan, a ten year old boy spy who fights against The Prefect and his agents of SMIRK. His name is a pun on the old TV show _Danger Man_.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Agent Cody Banks_ follows the adventures of the 15-year-old title character, played by Frankie Muniz, who has to finish his chores, avoid getting grounded, and save the world by going undercover for the CIA as a James Bond type superspy.
-   Agent 83, aka Megan Walsh, in _Barely Lethal_ is a runaway from the Prescott Academy who faked her death during a mission in order to experience life as an Ordinary High-School Student.
-   The children in _Catch That Kid_ are technically Teen Bank Robbers, but the film and especially the advertising leaned heavily on this trope in the high-tech nature of both their plan and their target.
-   The Stinger at the end of _Charlie's Angels (2019)_ features a group of teenage recruits into the Townsend Agency (played by Hailee Steinfeld, Lili Reinhart, Aly Raisman, and Chloe Kim) going through their training.
-   In _D.E.B.S._, there is apparently a secret portion of the SATs that determines whether somebody has the capacity to lie, cheat, fight, and kill. Those who pass screening are recruited into the D.E.B.S. Spy School.
-   Lance Elliot from _The Double 0 Kid_. 17-year-old Lance Elliot is a summer intern at the Agency. His fantasies of espionage and intrigue turn real when he's ordered to rush a package to L.A. A madman millionaire computer virus designer and his icy henchwoman want that package. It's key to their plot to destroy the environment. Lance stays one step ahead of them, trying to avoid a visit to their "video-game-of-doom" room.
-   _Hanna_ is a deconstruction, mainly by playing it less in the James Bond Tuxedo and Martini style and more in the "Stale Beer" Jason Bourne style. The titular Hanna is the daughter of a rogue CIA operative who's been living with him in a remote cabin in the woods in northern Finland, and he's been training her to defend herself in the event that his former employers take him out. Hanna is also the sole survivor of a Super-Soldier program, which explains her badass feats.
-   Michael Corbin from _If Looks Could Kill_. When Michael Corben, along with the rest of his high-school French class, set out for a trip to France, he runs headlong into international intrigue: Agent Michael Corbin has just been disposed of by the evil forces of Augustus Steranko. When it's learned that Michael Corbin is alive and well, and still on his way to France, he's beseiged by both the good guys and the bad guys. British Intelligence outfits him with a series of James-Bond-like gizmos, and Steranko sends more would-be assassins after him.
-   In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Black Widow program is this trope given the Stale Beer treatment. Young orphan girls are taken into the program and subjected to a mix of Training from Hell and brainwashing to turn them into superspies for the Soviet and later Russian government. Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova both escaped from the program, and the plot of the _Black Widow_ movie revolves around taking it down.
-   _Spy Kids_ (strictly speaking, they are tween superspies, though Carmen is in her teens by the third movie). The franchise follows the adventures of Carmen and Juni Cortez, two children who become involved in their parents' espionage. The rest of their family are spies as well, including their estranged uncle, Machete, and maternal grandparents.
-   _Stormbreaker_, a film adaptation of the Alex Rider books. The film's plot follows a teenage boy who is recruited by MI6 after his uncle, a secret agent, is killed in action. He is sent on a mission in Cornwall to gather intelligence behind _Stormbreaker_, an advanced computer system being provided to schools across Britain, and its creator, billionaire Darrius Sayle.
-   They tried to make the _Thunderbirds_ film like this. When The Hood finds and invades International Rescue's secret base and traps most of the Tracy family, only young Alan Tracy and his friends can save the day.

    Literature 

-   _Alex Rider_. He was secretly trained from birth — and, by "secretly", we mean not even Alex himself was aware that the activities in question (karate, extreme sports and traveling abroad) were training — to carry the legacy of his uncle. Because he is in the wrong place in the wrong time, he is recruited early because no one will suspect a child. The series ultimately becomes a deconstruction of the character type. Far from finding his adventures exciting, Alex is forced to work for MI6 and, against his will, basically becomes a Child Soldier, all while becoming alienated from his friends and repeatedly traumatized by the mortal peril he is thrown into.
    -   And in the third book, we learn that the CIA tried to do the same thing and failed miserably, with their teen super-spy getting killed almost immediately on his first mission. Alex succeeds because he is just very, very good at what he does, and very, very, _very_ lucky.
-   The _Alpha Force_ series of novels by Chris Ryan has a Multinational Team of kids who work for a covert agency after being shipwrecked together in the first novel, "Survival".
-   _Artemis Fowl_ is one, albeit self-employed. No government agencies for him — Artemis has the style and the gadgets. Juliet is another, and even joins a SWAT team in _The Eternity Code_.
-   The _CHERUB Series_. CHERUB tries a lot harder to be realistic than most other versions of this trope.
-   During the _James Bond_\-inspired '60s superspy craze, Grosset & Dunlap published a hardcover kids' series of the adventures of _Christopher Cool, TEEN Agent_. The Top-secret Educational Espionage Network kept the free world safe from the evil machinations of TOAD.
-   In _The Finishing School Series_, the protagonist Sophronia Temminnick is recruited by an espionage school masquerading as a charm school.
-   _The Gallagher Girls_ book series trains teenage girls to be spies.
-   _Kim_ is a moderate example. He starts off in a plausible non-super way as a Street Urchin who is used by a passing spy to carry messages for him. The only thing super about him is his ability to flawlessly enter every culture in India.
-   The _Micro Adventures_ series from the 80's involves the reader in the plot as a teenage computer whiz who's an agent for A.C.T., the Adventure Connection Team, Code Name Orion. Several times per book the story stops and begins a section with lines of code the reader's supposed to enter into their own computer to run a program mimicking what's going on in the plot, including decoding secret messages from headquarters. There's a bit of the usual superspy gimmickery, most prominently in the portable computer the size of a walkman that the reader uses to perform all these feats of computation, which probably seemed like mind-blowing fantasy at the time.
-   _Pygmy_ by Chuck Palahniuk has a group of these as Villain Protagonists. They were sent to America by a totalitarian commie-Nazi regime with a mission to destroy the US government.
-   Phoenix in _Red Handed_ is training to be an alien hunter.
-   _Ruby Redfort_ is a expert code breaker and was hired to work at Spectrum, a top secret agency keeping tabs on the world. A long time ago, Spectrum tried to train other teen spies, like Bradley Baker and Buzz.
-   Played with in the _Spy Gear Adventures_ novels. The kids aren't officially members of any secret agency, and mostly just use spy gadgets they found in a warehouse in the woods. Some of their missions (which are all set in their hometown) have the possibility of world-changing implications should they fail, but they're rarely in real danger, and always make it out okay.
-   The _Spy High_ series of novels.
-   From _Steampunk Detective_, Jack Mason is one since his apprenticeship to Ignatius Doyle onwards.
-   _Tortall Universe_: Aly in the _Trickster's Duet_ is a borderline example. While she is the spymaster for a very successful rebellion and later government, she has this as her main job (she's 17), lacks any special gadgets (medieval society) and relies on traditional, entirely un-flashy techniques, like feeding the mole and carefully asking questions. So, while she is indeed a teenager and a very capable spy, she isn't working the way we'd expect her to at all.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In Lois McMaster Bujold's _Vorkosigan Saga_, Miles Vorkosigan starts out this way, though he gets to just shy of 30 before his career as a spy comes to an end. He is definitely a wrong-place/wrong-time variant; his first 'mission' started out as a vacation after washing out of the local Barrayaran military academy and he only contacted his government _after_ they filed treason charges over the whole Private Army Thing.
-   _James Bond_ has a spin-off series called _Young Bond_, which is about him becoming a teen spy. He only acts the part proper in the fifth novel, _By Royal Command_.
-   Whateley Universe: The Intelligence Cadet Corps, AKA the 'Spy Kids' or even more derisively, the 'Secret Squirrels'. They are an official school club for wannabe spies and investigators, who spend most of the time spying on the Bad Seeds (the official club for the children of Supervillains), the Masterminds (the somewhat less official club for aspiring criminal masterminds), and anyone else they deem suspicious - including some of the teachers and staff, with even their club sponsor not immune to their bugs and cameras. This compulsive intrusion on people's privacy gets them into deep trouble more than once, but at the same time they are instrumental in solving a few of the mysteries going on at Whateley Academy.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _21 Jump Street_, an '80s Spiritual Successor to the below-mentioned _The Mod Squad_, is an inversion. Here, the twentysomething undercover cops pose as teenagers and infiltrate high schools and universities. Its film adaptation is much the same, albeit Played for Laughs.
-   Sydney Bristow on _Alias_ is a Teen Superspy all grown up, and a relatively downplayed take on this trope, having been recruited into SD-6 as a 19-year-old college freshman just one year removed from teenage life. She's 26 by the start of the show and no longer an example, but the first season still has elements of this, as she has to juggle grad school with espionage. Notably, the show was originally born from an idea that J. J. Abrams had for a Plot Twist on _Felicity_, a drama about the titular college student that played like a slightly grown-up version of a Teen Drama, in which Felicity turned out to be a CIA agent.
-   Yu Na and Min (and their friends) in _Born to Spy_. After realising their missing parents are spies, they carry on the mission, using their parents' gadgets and the training they have been given unknowingly.
-   _Connor Undercover_: Connor Heath is an ordinary 15-year-old. He extremely over imagines things and is always looking for adventure however he never finds any, that is until the Cordoban president's daughter is sent to live with him and his family. After numerous attempts on Gisela's life, Ed, a body-guard for the Cordoban secret service joins them.
-   _Hanna_, like the film it was based on, is about a teenage girl who escaped from a CIA assassin program and is now on the run.
-   Disney Channel series _K.C. Undercover_, featuring former _Shake it Up_ costar Zendaya in the title role. For K.C. Cooper, it's a family thing, as she was recruited upon finding out that her parents were secret agents.
-   _M.I. High_. The series focuses on a team of undercover teenage spies working for the fictional secret intelligence agency M.I.9 who have to balance their school life with their jobs as secret agents.
-   _The Mod Squad_ is a police version of this trope, in which three teenage delinquents are recruited to infiltrate the '60s counterculture.
-   Benjamin "Beans" Baxter, Jr from _The New Adventures of Beans Baxter_. Teenaged Beans mailman father disappears one day and Beans discovers his dad was really a courier for a secret government agency. Soon Beans is drawn into espionage, becoming a secret agent for the government.
-   _Odd Squad_ stars 4 main characters being part of a crew called the Odd Squad, a CIA-type agency run by... well, kids. Technically, these would technically be 'pre-teen superspies', as all of the characters are around ten years old.
-   Eleven on _Stranger Things_ was being trained by the government to become one of these, using her Psychic Powers to remotely spy on America's enemies. However, she broke out of Hawkins Laboratory before she could enter service.
-   The yellow ranger of spy-themed _Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters_ is 16 years old. Her two teammates don't qualify, though, as they're both aged in their 20s.

    Puppet Shows 

-   The 9-year-old lead character in _Joe 90_.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Super Spy Twilight from _Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder_. Granted, the "teen" part is debatable, but the _actual_ Twilight has been writing fics since childhood so it's not entirely implausible.

    Video Games 

-   Black Widow is one in _Avengers Academy_ thanks to an Age Lift.
-   Sakazaki Yuuya in _Hatoful Boyfriend_ turns out to be one investigating Dr. Iwamine Shuu and the Hawk Party. If the player completes his route, the heroine runs away with him and it's implied that they become partners.
-   Raz becomes this at the end of _Psychonauts_; a _psychic_ secret agent.
-   Rouge the Bat from the _Sonic The Hedgehog_ series is a master thief who works for the G.U.N. military force. She's also 18 years old.
-   In Riddle Joker the protagonist Satoru and his sister Nanami are a more downplayed version, working for the SFD, an organisation fighting superpowered crime, generally of the street level variety rather than anything like super villains. They have superpowers of their own which is somewhat rare and normal law enforcement aren't allowed to use such powers so the organisation can't afford to be picky about their age.
-   The protagonist of Polish point and click adventure game _Teenagent_.

    Web Animation 

-   The tagline of _Princess Natasha_: Student - Secret Agent - Princess.

    Webcomics 

    Web Videos 

-   _Aim High_, a web series in which the main character Nick Green is one of 64 underage operatives of the program DEPP.

    Western Animation 

-   _Bruno the Kid_. Partially subverted in that his employing agency thought he was an adult, due to his using an avatar when communicating with them.
-   _Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids_: Teen Superspy rock musicians, no less!
-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_: The series centers on the adventures of a group of five 10-year-olds who operate from a high-tech tree house, fighting against adult and teen villains with advanced 2×4 technology. Using their codenames (Numbuhs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), they are Sector V, part of a global organization called the Kids Next Door.
-   _Delilah & Julius_ is about a duo of teen super spies with great chemistry and a fair amount of UST.
-   _Grossology_: Ty and Abby are a teen brother and sister crime-fighting team who report to the Bureau of Grossology, a secret government agency whose job is to investigate gross criminals, their gross crimes, and/or various gross phenomena.
-   _I.N.K. Invisible Network of Kids_: Pinkerton School is a boarding school with two teachers. One of the teachers, Mr. Soper, is nice, and the other, Ms. Macbeth, is evil and is constantly trying to enslave the children of the school. However, four of the students act as a secret organisation known as "The Invisible Network of Kids", or "I.N.K." for short. I.N.K's mission is to thwart all of Ms. Macbeth's evil plans.
-   _James Bond Jr._: While attending prep school at Warfield Academy, Bond's nephew James Bond Jr., with the help of his friends IQ (the grandson of Q), and Gordo Leiter (the son of Felix Leiter), fight against the evil terrorist organisation S.C.U.M. (Saboteurs and Criminals United in Mayhem), a SPECTRE-like organization.
-   _Kim Possible_ — the lead character is technically a freelancer and not even a spy (she doesn't even bother with keeping a secret identity), but she otherwise fits the trope.
-   _Mary Kate and Ashley in Action!_. No, really. We get to see two of the biggest teen stars in the world comment on their "film" adventures and then, with the power of animation, we join them — at the premiere — to watch their on-screen Super Teen Agent identities fight the good fight and save the world from evil. These girls go right from the pre-show interview in real life straight to exotic locations like the Great Wall of China as animated Special Agents.
-   _Max Steel (2013)_: A 16-year-old boy named "Maxwell McGrath" is thrown into a new life when he and his mom moved to a small town called Copper Canyon. There he meets new friends, enemies, and a lot more. But later he started to generate a powerful energy called "T.U.R.B.O. Energy". Max must now join N-Tek, a secret organization his father worked on and meets a friendly ultralink named N'barro Aksteel X377/Steel.
-   An odd piece of Wild Mass Guessing from _Phineas and Ferb_. They were employing Perry when he was just a newborn, and many new OWCA members haven't been "trained" yet...so technically, they're this.
    -   In a more literal sense, Perry that time he was in Candace's body. As the theme song says, "She's a semi-neurotic teenage girl of action".
-   _Rick and Morty_: High school student Tammy Guterman is revealed to be a deep cover agent for the Galactic Federation. Of course, since its unclear if she's actually human, it's possible she wasn't even a teenager.
-   _Totally Spies!_ — There's even a rank at WOOHP (**W**orld **O**rganization **o**f **H**uman **P**rotection) called "superspy."
    -   The spin-off, _The Amazing Spiez!_, though only one of the four spies was technically a teenager.
