**God:** Alucard... you are forgiven. And if you are brave enough to accept it—  
**Alucard:** Didn't ask; don't need it; go fuck yourself!

When that offer of redemption just isn't good enough, some villains will outright reject the chance. Sure, some people will do whatever it takes to wash away their sins and join the side of good after a lifetime of committing unspeakable evil. But not this character. No, when Old Lady Redemption offers them that Last-Second Chance, they tell her "forget it" and steal her wallet for good measure.

This trope is the opposite of a Heel–Face Door-Slam, where the bad guy is actively seeking redemption, but is denied it (though the slam can be self-inflicted into this). For this trope, circumstances go out of their way to give someone a chance at mending their wicked ways, only for the offer to be firmly refused. It's the villain being told "you can turn away from evil," only for them to respond "I don't want to turn away."

Maybe the bad guy doesn't see themselves as the villain, and so doesn't think redemption is necessary. Maybe they realize their own wickedness, but think after all they've done, redemption is impossible, and therefore pointless to pursue. Maybe their motives for doing evil are so powerful that a guilty conscience is a small price to pay. Maybe they think that if people are going to treat them as the bad guy no matter what they do, they might as well go in with a full head of steam. Maybe they just have no morals and think that Evil Feels Good. Or rarely, they are an honourable Anti-Villain with either Undying Loyalty toward their masters or possessing Villainous Valour.

Whatever the case, this is often a strong contender for the villain's Moral Event Horizon, the signal for the heroes to take the gloves off and give the villain what he now most definitely has coming to him.

Not to be confused with Reformed, but Rejected. Compare Ignored Epiphany (where the villain has a moment of self-realization but dismisses it), I've Come Too Far (where the villain feels that they've already gone too far down the path of evil to turn around), Redemption Failure (where the villain makes a sincere effort to reform but isn't able to stick to it), Beyond Redemption (where a hero decides that a villain isn't worth trying to reform anymore) and Villains Want Mercy (where the villain may now want or even demand the chance to reform but it's Off the Table by then).

-   _The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Disney)_. Frollo fears going to Hell as much as any sane man, and he knows damn well that this will happen to him if he doesn't let go of his obsession with Esmaralda, but he throws away every chance to save his own soul.
-   _Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths_. Batman attempts this on Owlman, saying he must have been a good man once.
    
    **Owlman:** No. Not _good_. Never _good_. After all, I'm only human.
    
-   _Kung Fu Panda_:
    -   In the first movie, Shifu apologizes to Tai Lung for helping to shape him into the monster he's become, saying that his pride blinded him to the fact that his pupil had a few darker tendencies that he should have noticed and possibly fixed. Tai Lung appears genuinely moved for a moment... and then angrily says that he didn't come here for apologies: he only wants the Dragon Scroll. During the final fight, Po gives Tai Lung one last chance to redeem himself by explaining to him what the Dragon Scroll actually means (it doesn't instantly grant the user amazing powers, but is meant to show them that the potential for greatness already lies within themselves). Tai Lung, however, still refuses to see reason and continues to attack, whereupon Po no longer holds back and kills him.
    -   In _Kung Fu Panda 2_, Lord Shen's fleet is wrecked, his weapons are destroyed, and Po offers him a chance to reject his philosophy and repent. He instead tries to kill Po one last time. It doesn't go well for him, though unlike Tai-Lung he seems to find peace right before the end.
-   Near the end of _The Lorax (2012)_ all the townspeople partake in a musical number where they sing about the benefits of bringing back real trees. Eventually the main villain joins in. "My name's O'Hare, I'm one of you!/ I live in Thneedville too./ The things you say just might be true./ It might be time to start anew/ And change my point of view... Nah! I say let it die! Let it die, let it die, let it shrivel up and... Come on! Who's with me?"
-   In _The Simpsons Movie_, upon learning that the government is about to destroy Springfield, Marge tries to convince Homer to come with them by saying "In every marriage you get one chance to say, 'I need you to do this with me.' And there's only one answer when somebody says that." Homer's response?
    
    **Homer:** That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard!  
    **Marge:** Homer Simpson!
    
-   _Toy Story 3_: When Lotso is about to be crushed by landfill machinery, Andy's toys go out of their way to save him. He repays them by walking away and abandoning them to near-certain death, which they're only saved from by the timely intervention of the Little Green Men. This costs him.

Kiara, Simba's daughter, attempted a Take My Hand! as Zira dangled over a cliff above a raging river. Zira, however, has harbored an irrational hatred of Simba since Scar's day, and verbally rejects Kiara's offer before letting go willingly. This was changed in the final cut for being too dark.

-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe:_
    -   In _The Avengers (2012)_, Thor tells his brother Loki (the villain) that it's not too late to stop his plan after unleashing an army of aliens on New York. For a second it seems like Loki will back down, but then he stabs his brother in the stomach and blows off his offer as 'sentiment'. This finally pushes Thor over the edge, and he quickly curb-stomps Loki.
        -   Loki makes a habit of this, up until his actual redemption and subsequent death. In _Thor: The Dark World_, Loki is given a chance to help Thor avenge their mother by stopping the Dark Elves, and Loki, after much bickering, sincerely helps save Thor's love Jane and kills the monster that killed their mother. It appears to be a Redemption Equals Death moment...except Loki instead uses this as an opportunity to _fake_ his death, return to Asgard in disguise, kidnap Odin, and assume his place as king. In _Thor: Ragnarok_, after this was exposed and the two ended up on Sakaar, Loki is captured by Valkyrie before he can turn Thor over to the Grandmaster, and offers Thor a means to escape back to Asgard. During this plan, however, Loki attempts to betray Thor just as they seem to have an understanding, only for Thor to see this coming and incapacitate Loki with the control disk previously used on Thor, allowing Thor to give him a speech where he points out that Loki is always squandering his potential with betrayals when he could be something more. Loki takes this to heart and arrives later to help evacuate the Asgardians, after which he sincerely redeems himself and rejoins his brother, later dying while trying to protect him from Thanos.
    -   _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_: Nebula refuses the Last-Second Chance given by her step sister and exits the scene via High-Dive Escape.

When Dar-Benn gets pinned under debris, they beg her to stop and say if they work together, they can use their powers to reignite Hala's sun without hurting anyone. She appears to agree, but as soon as they free her, she attacks them again since she hates Carol that much.
-   At the end of _Oz the Great and Powerful_, Oscar tries to sympathize with the Wicked Witch of the West (Theodora), stating her Start of Darkness was not her fault, and should she ever find a speck of light within her rotted heart, he'd welcome her back with open arms. She replies with a Big "NEVER!", and flies away on a broom while cackling, setting her eventual fate 15 years later.
-   Amon Goeth from _Schindler's List_ has two major redemption rejections in the film. First, Schindler convinces him that pardoning people rather than killing them for minor infractions is a sign of true power. Goeth tries this for a while before shooting a young man for not cleaning his bathroom properly. Second is his relationship with his maid, Helen, who he seems to care somewhat for and who almost convinces him that Jews are more than just vermin, but he ends up beating her mercilessly.
-   In _Sodom and Gomorrah_, after receiving a message from Jehovah about the impending destruction of the title cities, Hebrew leader Lot tries to appeal to Queen Bera of Sodom and her subjects to repent their sinful ways and join the Hebrews in following Jehovah to spare them from His vengeance. But none of the Sodomites are interested (one in particular tells Lot he's happy in Sodom and throws a goblet of wine in his face), while Bera tells Lot that she feels she has nothing to repent, and even a final warning from Jehovah Himself does not sway her.
    
    **Bera:** What you call sin, to me is virtue. And all-powerful Death, whom you hate, I worship. I turn my back on you, Lot. _(stands up)_ On you... and your _impotent_ god. _(the Sodomites cheer as she turns to leave; Jehovah promptly signals that He means business with a bolt of lightning in a largely clear sky, and Lot looks meaningfully skyward, but Bera smirks defiantly)_ Clouds, lightning. Such simple wonders you teach your people to fear.
    
-   In the _Star Wars_ series, The Heavy Kylo Ren does this twice:
    -   _The Force Awakens_: Han Solo offers Kylo (a.k.a: his son Ben) a chance to reject The Dark Side and come home to his family who love him. Ren appears to consider it, shedding tears and even handing Han his lightsaber, but ultimately impales Han with it and throws his body into an abyss, saying his love for Han is a weakness he has to give up.
    -   _The Last Jedi_: Rey offers Kylo the chance to join her after he kills his master, the Greater-Scope Villain Snoke, and they fight off his Praetorian Guard together. Instead, he tries to pull a We Can Rule Together on _her_ and stays behind to take over the First Order.

At the end, she puts him in an isolated room, where he sees visions of the many people he killed: enemies, friends, even an innocent girl who was a bystander during one of his many drive-by shootings. Ultimately, however, Crazy K rejects redemption, telling the lady (who was really an angel) that he doesn't give a fuck. The lady finally gives up and Crazy K, who really died from his gunshot wound and was given a chance to save his soul, was sent to Hell. Discussed by the Narrator who mentions that people like him are too far gone and can't be saved.
-   In _TRON: Legacy_, Kevin Flynn tries to talk sense into his creation, the Program Clu, who, in following Flynn's orders to create "the perfect system," turned the Grid into a dystopian society were Programs are oppressed.

After apologizing, Kevin silently offers to give Clu a hug. Clu seems at first willing to embrace his creator... but then quickly kicks him to the ground, revealing that he will never stop in his quest for perfection.

-   Alluded to in "The Hounds" by The Protomen:
    
    _If there ever was a time, if there ever was a chance  
    To undo the things I've done and wash these bloodstains from my hands  
    It has passed and been forgotten, these are the paths that we must take  
    'Cuz you and I, Tom, we are men and we can bend, and we can break_

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   _Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus_: In the climax, the players have the chance to try to talk the Fallen Angel and archdevil Zariel into accepting the spark of goodness that remains within her old sword and turning away from evil. This is a challenging task, and if they fail she violently rejects the idea of rejoining the hosts of heaven and shatters her sword, putting herself forever beyond redemption.
    -   _Dragonlance_: When the deity Mishakal offered Lord Soth a chance at redemption by stopping the Kingpriest of Istar and preventing the Cataclysm, he initially accepted the request but then put aside his mission to confront his second wife about her infidelity. As a result, he was cursed to become a death knight. While in Ravenloft, Soth was given an opportunity by the Dark Powers to put his evil past behind him; he rejected their offer and was made into the Darklord of Sithicus. After spending a long time with a magic mirror showing him all of the mistakes in his life, Soth finally accepts that all of his misery was ultimately his own fault. The Dark Powers send him back to Krynn since nothing they can do to him could be worse than his own guilt and apathy. When Takhisis comes calling again, Soth rejects her.

An angel appears and pleads with them one last time to accept their Creator's forgiveness. They refuse and exultantly jeer that God MUST fear them, or he wouldn't be giving them a chance to surrender. They demand to face God.

    -   In a different scenario Caine (the Biblical one, here the first vampire) comes face to face with the ghost of his slain brother Abel. Abel says he forgives his brother and offers him the chance to move on together with him. While the notes state that the gamemaster _could_ have Caine accept this offer it is much more in character for Caine to tell his brother to shove it. At several points the same sourcebook it also implies that Caine could end his vampiric curse at any time by accepting God's forgiveness but refuses to do so until God apologises first for setting him up to sin, although depending on one's interpretation of the Old World of Darkness version of God Caine might be in the right there.
