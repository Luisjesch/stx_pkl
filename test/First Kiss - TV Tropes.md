Well, we all know what a first kiss is, so let's just get down to the trope.

An _individual_'s first kiss will generally be the subject of a great deal of nervousness. It may be preceded by some Kissing Warm-Up. Subjects (usually teenaged) will approach one another tentatively. They'll want it to be perfect, and with the perfect person, and when it inevitably isn't... well, it'll turn out all right anyway. In Japan, where the culture is more strict, the first kiss is an even bigger deal; Sacred First Kiss has more details.

A _couple_'s first kiss will be the subject of much squeeing among fans, who have had to suffer through Will They or Won't They? for months or years. It may end the UST and result in a Relationship Upgrade, or may be sacrificed at the altar of the god, Status Quo. These kisses tend to be made in times of high stress, because the participants Cannot Spit It Out under normal circumstances. This often becomes The Big Damn Kiss, especially in action-packed dramas.

Whatever the type, a first kiss is very susceptible to being a positive moment — more so if the first kiss is also a Last Kiss. Contrasts with Fake First Kiss.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Played with in _Baccano!_; Jacuzzi Splot and Nice Holystone had been lovers for ten years, but it wasn't until the Flying Pussyfoot incident that they ever actually kissed. Jacuzzi, of all people, is the one who instigates the kiss...because he's going off to fight the leader of the Lemures and is convinced that he's never coming back. Don't worry, he turns out fine.
-   _Berserk_:
    -   Many fans believe Guts' first kiss with Casca happens at the waterfall before they make love but it actually happens much earlier when Casca falls off a cliff after being attacked by Adon with Guts plunging after her<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . When Guts drags her ashore, he performs mouth to mouth immediately which is the first time both of them, but since Casca is unconscious and unknowing at the time it can be said their later make out at the waterfall is the Official Kiss for her.
    -   Princess Charlotte's first kiss is Griffith, and it's quite forceful and sudden for her. Griffith himself even asks her if she is afraid when she meekly resists him ever so slightly, as he is attempting to seduce her at the time. This is some disturbing foreshadowing of his later horrific actions.
-   _Bladedance of Elementalers_: In the end of Volume 1/episode 4, Claire kisses Kamito to motivate him, making it a first kiss for both. Later Est, Ellis, Restia, Rinslet and Fianna also get their first kiss by Kamito.
-   _Code Geass_:
    -   Lelouch Lamperouge/vi Britannia gets his First Kiss from Shirley Fenette in Episode 12. It's played for drama, however; Shirley had just learned her father had been killed at the Battle of Narita, and being emotionally unstable at the time, she kissed Lelouch. She later apologizes for it once she's calmed down a bit, saying it wasn't fair to him, and remarks on the irony that despite her long-time crush on him, she can't even be happy that they finally kissed. The fact that, unbeknownst to her, Lelouch is almost directly responsible for getting her father killed (as he is Zero, leader of the Black Knights) makes it worse.
    -   Near the end of the first season, Lelouch gets another First Kiss from C.C., though the psychic powers she uses by physical contact make it unclear what her reasons for doing this are. Still, it's undeniably one of their biggest Ship Tease moments.
    -   In R2, thanks to several rounds of altered memories, Shirley thinks she gets her First Kiss from Lelouch. However, since it's actually Sayoko Shinozaki in disguise, this actually means that their First _real_ Kiss is also their Last Kiss, as Shirley later winds up shot dead by Rolo Haliburton in Episode 38.
    -   And near the end of R2, in Episode 47, Lelouch also gets a first (and only) kiss from Kallen Kozuki, both for the latter to convey her true feelings and to gain a reaction out of Lelouch. This was particularly significant since Kallen was very sensitive about giving her first kiss, as shown during the first season's Cat Hunt episode. It also counts as Lelouch's Last Kiss, as this is the not only the last time he's ever shown being kissed, but at the end of the series he orchestrates his own assassination to achieve world peace.
-   _Cross Ange:_
    -   Much to her chagrin, Ange finds herself unfortunate to have lost her first kiss to another woman. And that woman being Zola Axberg, her new commander in Arzenal's First Company, who was attempting to rape her. Ange's post-episode narration even lampshades it. Ange also ends up being Zola's Last Kiss, as she winds up dead in the following mission when Ange makes a disastrous attempt to flee Arzenal during a mission.
    -   However, Ange's first kiss with the opposite gender takes place in Episode 14, where she shares one with Tusk after accepting his feelings, marking a Relationship Upgrade between the two. They were even attempting to go further than that at the time, but were interrupted (but they do get there later on).
-   In _Cyberpunk: Edgerunners_, Lucy gives one to David after he promises to take her to the moon. After she is assured he wouldn't die on her, they then share a longer, more passionate kiss that seals the deal on them being the series' Official Couple.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Good Launch is actually Goku's first kiss, as she kisses him on the cheek sweetly while he's sleeping as a kid.
    -   Chi-Chi's first kiss is with Goku as she kisses him on the cheek after their match in the 23rd Martial Arts Tournament; it's sweet, especially Goku's confused facial expression. However, on-cheek is the only kisses Goku has gotten as he revealed in _Dragon Ball Super_ with Goku saying he's never kissed Chi-Chi on the lips and doesn't know what it feels like despite being married to her for years and having two sons with her (though it's an ongoing debate as to whether this is true, or a translation error regarding a joke).
    -   Happens off-screen with Gohan and Videl in _Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon_ as Trunks and Goten reveal they were watching them in secret causing Gohan to get angry and Videl to become embarrassed.
    -   Trunks and Mai in _Dragon Ball Super_, however the camera pans away before we see them lock lips.
    -   Also in _Super_, Bulma is shown giving her husband Vegeta a kiss on the cheek for the first time as a Smooch of Victory. Vegeta freaks out and tells Bulma to warn him next time.
-   In _Fist of the North Star_, Kenshiro’s first kiss surprisingly _wasn’t his fiancé_ Yuria, but Mamiya! As a ploy to fool the Fang Clan, she pretends to be his wife and kisses Kenshiro (on the lips) to prove it. What’s even more ironic is that this is technically the **only** time Kenshiro gets any lip action in the series despite Yuria showing up again later.
-   In _Full Metal Panic!_, Kaname's first kiss is "stolen" by Leonard Testarossa, a fact which upsets her greatly and leads to a good deal of nervousness around her love interest Sosuke. In later novels, when the two of them are finally able to confess their feelings for each other, Kaname promises that they'll share a kiss when they get back together; it finally happens six months later in-story, at the very end of the series, in front of all their cheering classmates.
-   _Girls Bravo_: Kosame gets injured while trying to save Kirie, by taking a punch from Lilica for her. Kirie was so touched by Kosame's gesture, that she embraces her and was relieved to see she hadn't been seriously injured. Kosame took as an open invitation to slip her the tongue, which Kirie lamented as having been her first.
-   One happens at the climax of _The Gods Lie_, between Rio and Natsuru, as they hide in the closet of a ryokan while on the run from the authorities.
-   _High School D×D_: Rias gives her first kiss to Issei (who also has his first kiss) after he saves her from her Arranged Marriage). All the other girls that end up joining Issei's harem end up giving their first kisses to him throughout the books.
-   In _Infinite Stratos_ Laura took the initiative of stealing Ichika's first. While still aboard her IS. _In front of the entire class AND the members of his harem. While loudly declaring that ichika (the male protagonist) is her wife._ Needless to say, the other girls were _not_ happy.
-   Dio steals Jonathan's girlfriend Erina's first kiss in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood_. This starts a Humiliation Conga - _Dio's_. Jonathan and Erina have their real first kiss at the end when Jonathan is dying from Dio’s Eye Beams, also making it a Last Kiss. Luckily for the Joestar Family legacy, Erina was already pregnant before Jonathan kicked the bucket.
-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_:
    -   Kaguya initiates her first kiss with Shirogane after witnessing his Grand Romantic Gesture during the culture festival and agreeing to go with him to Stanford. Unfortunately, a bit of miscommunication from Kashiwagi earlier on leads her to give him a full French kiss and her attempts to run damage control after realizing her mistake just leave him confused.
    -   Kashiwagi's first kiss with Tsubasa wasn't anything special by her own admission. They were just waiting for a red light to change while walking home from a date. When she is told about this, Kaguya comments that it sounds wonderful as normalcy is something that she never really had a chance to experience.
-   Parodied to hell and back in _Kodocha_. Sana's first kiss is with Akito, who kisses her in public. Akito's first kiss had been given as a kindergartener for 60 yen. Later, he finds out that the story of the first kiss ruined the kissed girl (Fuuka)'s love story.
-   Nanoka from _Koi Kaze_ pulls Koshiro into a kiss, then laments, "It's gone! My first kiss!"
-   Parodied to some extent in _Love Hina_ with Kaolla Su's chart. Keitaro's first -> Mutsumi. Naru's -> Also Mutsumi (she was saying hi both times). Motoko -> a kissing robot. Shinobu -> Tama the turtle. Kaolla Su -> Motoko's face is there, but it says it's her second.
-   _Lupin III: The Pursuit of Harimao's Treasure_: Lupin spends as much time trying to win Diana's affections, as he does searching for the fabled treasure, without success. Still, it wasn't a total loss, since he managed to steal a kiss. Judging by the way she caressed the area of her cheek, where he kissed her, and the way she smiled, afterward, it's implied to have been her first.
-   It's **very** strongly implied in _Macross_ (and its counterpart, _Robo Tech First Generation_) that the infamous "Hikaru kisses Misa in front of a Zentraedi audience" deal doubles as Hikaru's first kiss.
-   _MÄR_ has Ginta sharing his first kiss with Snow, and it's also her first kiss. Snow is also the in-universe expy of the girl he wishes he could share his first kiss with. Koyuki also acts as if this is her first kiss, despite it actually being another person.
-   _Mazinger Z_: In the _Mazinger-Z vs Great General of Darkness_ movie, Kouji is going to sortie with Mazinger-Z when Sayaka stops him. He is on the brink of crossing the Despair Event Horizon, and believing he'll inevitably die in the next battle, and Sayaka is anguished about it. They look at each other for a long moment, but finally they break up without kissing. However, when that scene was replayed in the manga (the episodes written by Gosaku Ota), they DID kiss. That scene was very heartwarming, but their relationship after the kiss was awkward for a while (since Kouji did now know how to deal with them being an Official Couple).
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_ has Kira Yamato receiving a kiss in zero gravity from Flay Allster, a girl with whom he has had a long-time crush on, in Phase 13. While he reciprocated the kiss earnestly, he didn't realize at the time that Flay was simply manipulating him into fighting harder against ZAFT, and hoping he would get killed in the process. And all of this was due to her hatred for Coordinators like Kira, and because he failed to save her father 4 episodes back.
-   _My-HiME_: Since Natsuki told Mai that she had no interest in romance while she was investigating District One to find out why her mother was killed, it can inferred that the kiss Shizuru plants on a sleeping Natsuki was her first, and sadly, non-consensual at that.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   The first onscreen meeting between Naruto and his rival Sasuke ends up being an Accidental Kiss in Chapter 3, when another student bumps Naruto over from behind, causing outrage from Sakura, Ino and the rest of the girls in the class, save for Hinata. This became the birth of the decade-spanning Ho Yay between Naruto/Sasuke.
    -   Fortunately for Naruto, the first time he is kissed by a woman is Tsunade, who kisses him on the forehead while giving him the first Hokage's necklace. Given the 50-year age difference and relationship she has with Naruto, this is more of a motherly action than anything else.
    -   Even more fortunately for Naruto, his first mutual and first romantic kiss is The Big Damn Kiss he shares with his One True Love and future wife, Hinata, in the climax of the Canon movie _The Last: Naruto the Movie_.
    -   The first and only time Kakashi kisses anyone is an Accidental Kiss with a woman named Hanare in a Filler episode.
-   In _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, one of the complications of the Pactio kiss is that for most of the girls involved, it's also their first.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: In episode 15, Asuka and Shinji kiss, but due to their respective personal traumas it goes awfully wrong. Asuka wanted to kiss Shinji but she did not want to look interested, in case he rejected her, so she told she wanted to kiss him because she was bored. Shinji wanted to kiss her but he could not believe she was interested in him, so he initially resisted. They went forward with the kiss but Asuka held Shinji's nose the whole time to pretend it was not a big deal in case of he turned her down. And right because she was pretending it was not a big deal, Shinji did not dare to do anything, and he remained motionless and unresponsive. The fact that Asuka was holding his nose also made it impossible for Shinji to breathe, making the kiss a more painful experience, than a pleasant one. And precisely because he remained motionless, Asuka thought he was turning her down and she ran off. Cue Shinji's self-esteem getting another blow and Asuka giving another step towards her mental breakdown. This was brought up again during the infamous Mind Rape scene. When the image of Shinji comes up in her head, she exclaims "What are you doing there?! You won't do anything! You won't help me! You won't even hold me!" And it's shown that after their first kiss, she ran to the bathroom to gargle so she could hide her pain from him about his lack of warmth.
-   _Ojisan And Marshmallow_: Done accidentally between Higi-san and Wakabayashi-san's brother, while overcome with emotion. He only meant to hug his sister, except he overshot the target. Whoops.
    
    "My first kiss tasted of marshmallow..."
    
-   _One Piece_: Eiichiro Oda has declared to the mewling fans that will be absolutely no hanky-panky in _One Piece_ at all. However, thanks to circumstance, at least three crewmates of The Straw Hat Pirates (Sanji, Franky and Luffy) have kissed or been kissed:
    -   Sanji's first (and only on-screen) kiss is during the Davy Back Filler where he is kissed on the cheek by Porche of the villain team when he saves her from falling during the Red Light Green Light game, however this causes Sanji to mess up his balance and lose the game. Sanji gets a canon kiss from Viola when hiding from Domflamingo's men, though Sanji being Sanji has the inevitable Nosebleed after the henchman pass. Sanji also has first kiss (out of panel) with Pudding at the end of Whole Cake Island which is also a Last Kiss.
    -   Franky gives the boss of the Smile factory Kyuin a Forceful Kiss when she's yelling at him while he fought Senior Pink. According to Franky, he did so because it's the most effective way for a man to silence a woman. Kyuin was flustered and angrily demanded that Franky should marry her as a result, but he ignored her.
    -   Luffy's first kiss, to the shock of everyone is from Vinsmoke Reiju Sanji's older sister who when Luffy is poisoned and dying literally sucks the poison out through his lips in a Kiss of Life scenario. The anime has the kiss going on for a full minute, complete with loud sucking noise.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   Ash's first kiss is actually given to him in the episode "Abra and the Psychic Pokémon", unfortunately by Team Rocket's Jessie and James (they kissed both his cheeks while in disguise for some sort of plan).
    -   He was kissed in the cheek later on in _Pokémon 2000_ by Melody and _Pokémon Heroes_ by either Bianca or Latias disguised as Bianca. In spite of this, he's never had an official lip-lock until Serena all but confessed her feelings to him at the end of _XY_. Unfortunately, and unlike the previous cases, Kissing Discretion Shot is in effect.
-   _Ranma ½_:
    -   Ranma's first kiss was forced upon him by a guy he hated: Handsome Lech Mikado Sanzen'nin. While he was transformed into a girl. Poor Ranma runs away screaming and crying, and Akane doesn't blame him at all.
    -   Ranma's first kiss in his guy form is from Shampoo, much to Akane Tendō's ire.
    -   If one counts the time Akane kissed "P-Chan" on his snout, then her first kiss was unintentionally with Ryōga. (No wonder Ranma was furious.) She seems to consider her first kiss to have been with Ranma while he was under the Cat-Fist.
-   In _Sand Chronicles_, Ann and Daigo share their first one together on the bus ride home from a field trip after more or less admitting their feelings to each other. Fuji also shares his first kiss with Ann after her birthday, despite knowing she's taken, and Shiika shares hers with Daigo after he has a falling out with Ann.
-   In _Seraph of the End_, Mikaela Hyakuya's first kiss was with the vampire queen Krul Tepes. She kissed him to save his life and turn him into a vampire.
-   _Shimoneta_: In episode 4, Tanukichi lands on top of Anna, after being struck by one of her stalkers. Because it was her first ever kiss, along with Tanukichi's knee being pressed against her pelvic region, it set off her pent-up hormones like an "ON" switch.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_'s first real heartwarming moment was Kamina asking Yoko to watch his back during battle. She called out his name and when he turned around, she leaned in and kissed him, saying "your rear really is defenseless, isn't it?" His surprise lasted a moment until he decided to take it further and kissed her back. Too bad the latter was also their Last Kiss as Kamina died at the end of the episode.
-   _Toradora!_: In the last episode of the anime, Taiga and Ryuuji share their first kisses while pretending to have a wedding ceremony.
-   _Wandering Son_:
    -   Maho kisses her boyfriend Seya for the first time when he visits her while she's sick. Maho, confused about his voice breaking, wonders if he maybe caught her cold.
    -   Much later, her sister Nitori kisses her girlfriend Anna while walking her home one day, also while sick. This is despite the two having been a couple for _at least_ three in-series years at that point.
-   _The World God Only Knows_:
    -   Most of the girls that Keima had captured most likely had their first kiss taken by Keima when he kissed them to capture the runaway spirits inhabiting their bodies. By that prospect, when Keima took Tenri's first kiss, he also took Diana's first kiss. And later on when he did the same with Tsukiyo, he took Vulcan's first kiss. And Keima's First Kiss was taken by Ayumi, the first girl he captured in the beginning of the series.
    -   There's a complicated example in a later chapter. Keima takes Chihiro to a secluded spot, and when the moment is right, pushes her down on a bench and gets on top of her. She mentions "It's my first time," but she means the kiss that's coming. The problem is, it's _not_ her first kiss, which he knows for a fact because he's the one who kissed her. And the entire reason he was pursuing her was because he thought she remembered that, which would mean she was immune to the memory-wipe, which would mean she had a goddess inside her. He figures this all out in seconds, and realizes it means he has the wrong girl.

Down boy.").

They're both holding each other's faces tightly to deepen the kiss, and lovemaking soon follows.
-   _Legion_: In "Chapter 22", while stargazing on the balcony of the psychiatric hospital, Charles Xavier and his Love Interest Gabrielle then gaze at each other for a moment before sharing their first kiss. It's the last clip of their Falling-in-Love Montage, so the kiss signals that they've moved past the courtship stage and are now a couple.
-   Despite being much, much older than anyone expected to experience this trope, _The Mighty Boosh_'s Howard Moon gets his first kiss in _Party_ on his birthday, and over-reacts.
-   Manny gets what is apparently his at the beginning of the _Modern Family_ episode "Party Crasher", with both him and the young woman unaware that his family is on the other side of the darkened room, waiting for the lights to go on so they can give him a surprise birthday party.
-   On _My Mad Fat Diary_, Rae finally gets her first one with Archie.
-   In _Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide_, Ned wanted his first kiss to be with Suzie - along the way he's kissed by the school nurse, the Weasel Mascot and others, reacting with a loud "That didn't count!" each time.
-   Used humourously in an episode of _Neighbours_. Sunny helps Ringo with his love letters to Donna, but Donna finds out and becomes extremely furious. However, she eventually forgives Sunny and kisses her. Sunny then shouts out that Donna "stole" her first kiss.
-   _Schitt's Creek_: David and Patrick's gentle first kiss is not only their first kiss but Patrick's first kiss with a man. He later tells David it felt like his first time.
-   The off-screen kiss between Naomi and Emily at that drunken middle school party in _Skins_ was, according to the E4.com character blogs, Naomi's first. (All the boys she dated were too wimpy to go for it; and besides, she'd already seen Emily by then.)
-   In _Smallville_, interestingly, Clark has as much as three first kisses depending on definition, all with Chloe. The first on-screen kiss is in _Hug_. While Chloe always wanted to do that, she had an influence that allows her to show her usually hidden affection. Their first on-screen and fully consensual kiss is in _Tempest_. Right in front of Lana to boot. Then in season eight _Abyss_, it is revealed Chloe kissed Clark when they were both kids and after Clark just used Super-Speed to find a book Chloe just lost. Aww.
    -   Clark and Lana's first kiss is in "Red".
-   _Stranger Things_:
    -   Mike and Eleven in the finale of Season 1 in the pinnacle of Puppy Love.

-   _The White Queen_: When Anne Neville and Richard of Gloucester meet clandestinely for the second time in a garden, they lock lips after she agrees to become his wife. They've been enamoured with each other throughout their youths, but decorum and their Feuding Families prohibit them from exhibiting any physical intimacy until their engagement.
-   On _Wizards of Waverly Place_, this occurs as the main plot in the episode "First Kiss".

    Video Games 

-   Every heroine is rather romantically naïve in _Canvas 2_ and generally has never even kissed before. Hiroki, though, is not a virgin. Of course.
-   In the _Dragon Age_ games, first kisses between the player character and their chosen Love Interest are a significant part of the Relationship Upgrade. Special mention should, however, be given to Alistair in _Dragon Age: Origins_. Based on his commentary, his first kiss with a female Warden is his first kiss _ever_.
-   In _Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon_, Seto's is stolen by Crow, who apparently thought that it's typical for friends to kiss since he read it in a book. This makes them best friends.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
-   _Galaxy Angel_: A major plot point in Milfeulle's route in Moonlit Lovers and is revisited due to another plot point in Eternal Lovers. Vanilla and Chitose get their first kisses near the end of Eternal Lovers, Mint first kisses Tact on the cheek while they're on the plane after Tact rescues her from being trapped by her father (no CG is devoted to this), and Forte first kisses Tact before the battle with Eonia (again, no CG is devoted to this). Ranpha's first kiss is by accident due to a zero-gravity malfunction.
-   In a majority of _Harvest Moon_ and _Story of Seasons_ games, you don't see the protagonist and their love interest kiss until their wedding day. A few, such as _Harvest Moon: Magical Melody_, include kissing in Heart Events.
-   _Jade Empire_ has a well-animated scene that is suggested to be the player's first kiss, heavily implied to be Dawn Star's if she is the girl, almost outright stated to be Silk Fox's if she is, and definitely not Sky's.
-   In _Resident Evil 2_ Leon and Ada have their first kiss when Ada seemly dies, in the remake it happened even earlier on the tram as a "Shut Up" Kiss. Unfortunately for the shippers, this is the _only_ time Leon and Ada get kissy in the canon despite appearing in many games and a movie together.
-   _The Sims 2_ has animations for most milestones in a Sim's life - including a levitating first kiss.
-   _Skies of Arcadia: Legends_: Seen at the end of Vyse and Aika's private conversation on the night before the battle with the Hydra Fortress, assuming his swashbuckler rating is high enough. If it isn't, Aika will simply thank Vyse for making her feel better and return to bed. Otherwise, choosing the correct response<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  will cause her to give him his first kiss... on the cheek.
-   It was never clear with the retro graphics when Mario saves Peach at the end of the early games but _Super Mario 64_ marks the first time you can see Peach kiss Mario clearly _enough_, though it's on the nose.
-   In _Tomb Raider (2013)_, Lara Croft's first kiss with Alex is a kiss on the cheek near the end of the game. Tragically, it was also a Last Kiss as Alex was about to perform a Heroic Sacrifice, and Lara seemed to think it was the most effective way of saying goodbye.
-   _Until Dawn_ has two:
    -   The first one is optional with Mike and Jess. She can kiss him or hit him in the face with a snowball when he's distracted. Whether that's _their_ first kiss is unknown.
    -   The second one is a definite first time for Chris and Ashley, who wishes Chris luck by kissing him before he leaves the lodge with the Stranger, signifying the pair have gotten over their Cannot Spit It Out. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In _The Walking Dead_, depending on the player's choice, Clementine's first kiss will either be with Gabe in _New Frontier_, or with Louis or Violet in _The Final Season_. Alternatively, this trope can be averted if she does not kiss any of those three.
-   Zelda kisses Link for the first time in _Zelda II: The Adventure of Link_ but it's cruelly hidden by a curtain.
-   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel_ plays with this heavily. In _Cold Steel II_, Rean's potential first kiss comes from Alisa in their dormitory scene where Alisa is the only person in Rean's harem to kiss him. But due to the events being optional and the games having no save transfers between _Cold Steel II_ and _Cold Steel III_, many can claim that it never happened. Instead, Rean's potential first kiss with Alisa is instead in _Cold Steel III_ at the Heimdallr Festival after finishing her events, though players can still choose not to pick Alisa and instead go for the friendship route. In _Cold Steel IV_, Rean can acknowledge that Alisa was his first kiss if players had a transfer save file from _Cold Steel III_, but if the player doesn't or has a save file where Rean didn't choose Alisa as a love interest, then his first kiss in the bonding events would Laura instead, whose first bonding event literally has her planting a deep one in Rean.

He certainly does, however, but they never really get the chance to discuss it since they have to run for their lives right after, and then everything goes downhill quite quickly. They've had The Big Damn Kiss since, though.
-   In _Homestuck_, when Jake has to kiss Dirk's severed head in order to bring him back from the dead, among the many other things wrong with this situation (including the Autoresponder's frustratingly flippant/flirty/matchmaky behaviour and, oh, _having to kiss his friend's decapitated head_) he expresses distress that their first kiss would have to happen _this_ way.
-   _Kubera_: After over 150 chapters of crushing on Leez, Yuta finally works up the courage to plant one on her... and then promptly loses control of his sura instincts and ends up _eating her face._ Good thing she can heal...

-   _Batman: The Animated Series_: A sultry, villainous example in the episode "Pretty Poison" which features Batman and Poison Ivy's very first kiss together in the DCAU canon. After applying a coat of tainted lipstick Poison Ivy saunters up to a flytrap entangled Batman and insistently locks lips with him in a short but steamy embrace. While their kiss was undeniably passionate there's nothing explicitly romantic about it and is simply Ivy enjoying herself at his expense before he dies (or so she thinks, as Batman survives).

-   In _Danny Phantom_, Danny's first kiss comes in the form of a Fake-Out Make-Out. Same for Sam, the one that he had it with.
-   _Doug_'s first kiss was the subject of an entire episode where he was getting these mysterious Secret Admirer notes in his locker. He goes through a series of private mind games worrying about who it was, and eventually found out it was Beebe Bluff (Who is a nicer version of the Alpha Bitch). It turned out that she had mistaken his locker for someone else's, but she got excited and kissed him because they could switch places in a parade; Doug got to be next to his crush Patti and Beebe next to her intended target, Doug's friend Skeeter.
