## This trope is under discussion in the Trope Repair Shop.

_"Nyeh! Nyeh! Oh, Kaiba, your dragon is so big. I'm a dog! Woof! Woof!"_

Sometimes a Erotic Dream will involve homosexual relations, even if the dreaming character is straight. And when this trope is applied, _especially_ if the dreaming character is straight (or thought themselves straight).

Often if another cast member appeared in the dream, that person will find out about it and will feel, if anything, more homosexual anxiety than the dreaming character. There will probably be some discussion of how this dream does not necessarily mean that the dreaming character really is gay — but likely this will not be reassuring for any characters involved in the dream.

Homoerotic dreams are mostly used for comedy but occasionally will be used for Ship Tease or as part of Will They or Won't They?.

This trope stems from Homoerotic Subtext as well as Erotic Dream. Also, whatever weird crap your unconscious mind can dish up. This is of course Truth in Television but people usually don't want to talk about it. Compare Stupid Sexy Flanders.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Adachi and Shimamura_, Adachi, who believed she was straight, had such a dream about Shimamura, causing her to realize she's attracted to the other girl.
-   In _Azumanga Daioh_, Kaorin has a dream with Sakaki. She is subsequently embarrassed when her parents notice that she had been drooling in her sleep.
-   Tsuzuki in one volume of the manga version of _Descendants of Darkness_ has a fairly tame but rather shiver-inducing one of these involving Muraki.
-   Daisuke of _D.N.Angel_ once had a dream that featured him hugging his crush Risa but she suddenly turned into Satoshi.
-   In the _Girls und Panzer_ spin-off _Ribbon Warrior_, Rin has one about being Shizuka's ponygirl.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_:
    -   Iceland had a dream where he was flying through the air with Turkey while the latter was only wearing his mask, a Santa hat, and boxer shorts.
    -   France seems to get one over at America and England's house, about China. ("China, you're so cute…) For further effect, he even has steam coming out of his head and a Longing Look on his face. All of this happens while China is in the same room. Hilarity Ensues.
-   Played with in the _Lucky Star_ OVA: Kagami has a dream that isn't erotic at all, but Dream-Konata tells her that the only way she can undo a spell is to say a specific phrase, which Kagami ends up saying out loud as she wakes up. It's unknown specifically what she said (she said "I want to \*BLEEP\* with Konata") but her sister's awkward reaction to hearing it along Kagami's embarrassment implies something less innocent than "I want to cosplay with Konata".
-   This trope is pretty much the premise of the _Miyuki-chan in Wonderland_ series. Despite having one of these every night, she still can't figure out what her dreams are trying to tell her.
-   In Chapter 15 of _Off\*beat_, Tory has an Imagine Spot where he and Colin face off against Dr. Garrets in a _Star Wars_\-esque world. After defeating Dr. Garrets, Tory pats Colin on the shoulder— and accidentally strips him down to his underwear. They draw closer, as if to kiss... and cut to the next morning, where Tory's mother tucks him in before leaving.
    
    **Tory:** _\[ducking underneath the covers while blushing\]_ Ah, shit!
    
-   In the Yaoi Genre _Oku-san's Daily Fantasties_ Oku has erotic daydreams almost constantly about his crush, Sudo, and (understandably) has a couple of erotic dreams as well.
-   _Ranma ½_: Ranma is a Sex Shifter who has no interest in men, but several of them are Abhorrent Admirers for his female form. This has given Ranma several Anxiety Dreams where guys still harass him—sometimes while Ranma's still in male form. The most explicit format is the anime take on his first Catapult Nightmare, which has (male) Ranma, who had just received a declaration of love from Tatewaki Kuno in the last episode, entering a room to find Tatewaki seated there, only to turn around and repeat his declaration of love. The floor promptly gave out and dumped a naked (and still male) Ranma in the bath… where he finds himself confronted by an equally nude Tatewaki, who stares at him with a love-sick expression and repeats his desire to date Ranma.
-   Julia from _Strawberry Shake Sweet_ has a _lot_ of these about Ran.
-   _Strike Witches_ had Yoshika having a dream about her best friend Lynette. Her explanation for said dream was that they were "flying in formation".
-   In _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_'s Special, titled "Viral's Sweet Dream", Viral continually has nightmares of Kamina in drag, the first time with Kamina being a bar pianist (wearing a wig and dress and everything) that Viral tries to hit on, and the second time with Viral talking to his child, only for it to be revealed that he's the "papa" and Kamina is the "mama".
-   In _YuYu Hakusho_, in order to get back to life in the first few episodes, Yusuke has to contact people he knows with spiritual awareness through dreams. One of the people is Kuwabara, who has a dream of Yusuke kissing him (since that's how Yusuke's body is supposed to come back)... and is immediately weirded out by it.

    Comics 

-   _Cable & Deadpool_:
    -   A recurring joke. When Black Mamba was using her ability to make people hallucinate their greatest fantasies in order to pacify Deadpool, he dreamed about applying suntan lotion to Cable (and oiling his Techno-Organic arm) on a sunny beach. Deadpool's reaction was not what she expected.
    -   It happened again later in the issue with Deadpool, Cable, Deadpool's friend Weasel, and Marvel's other bromantic couple Power Man & Iron Fist — when _they_ came to, they were tangled and on top of each other in a homoerotic manner.

    Fan Works 

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Black Swan_, Nina has such a dream about Lily. Or does she?
-   In _Blue Is the Warmest Color_, Adèle has them about Emma.
-   _Cynara: Poetry in Motion_: Cynara and Byron both have explicit fantasies of each other before the women later act on their desires, having a passionate though brief relationship.
-   In _Disclosure_, Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas) gets sexually harassed by his boss, Meredith Johnson (Demi Moore). Later, he has a dream in which he's in an elevator with the CEO of the company (played by Donald Sutherland) and the CEO leans in for a kiss, causing Sanders to wake up in terror. It doesn't really imply that Sanders is gay, more that being sexually harassed really screws with your head.
-   _Eloïse's Lover_: Àsia has one of her swimming naked with Eloïse in the pool.
-   _Embrace of the Vampire (2013)_: Charlotte kisses Sarah when both are drunk, then has sex with her... Though it's then revealed to be a dream when this becomes nightmarish while Sarah becomes a vampire while she's going down on Charlotte, drinking her blood suddenly.

-   _My Animal_: Heather dreams of Jonny, the girl she wants, naked while feeding her eggs sensually.

-   Played with in the _Doctor Who_ Eighth Doctor Adventures novel _Half Life_. Fitz dreams he and the Doctor are naked and back to back, and the Doctor reassures him it doesn't necessarily mean anything about his sexuality. However, any hint of eroticism is quickly lost when they start melding together. It turns out to be a sort of manifestation of the "Freaky Friday" Flip thing they're about to go through. It's nonetheless the subject of much amusement and Squee in fandom.
-   In _The Epic of Gilgamesh_, Gilgamesh has dreams of "caressing like a wife" an axe and a meteor which according to Ninsun both represent Enkidu. Also "axe" and "meteor" both sound a lot like words for male prostitutes in Akkadian... this makes this trope older than dirt which is unsurprising since people have always had dreams.
-   After meeting Sarah in _Patience and Sarah_, Patience has a dream where her sister-in-law Martha is topless. In the dream, Patience places her mouth on Martha's bosom, which Martha encourages. It's implied that Patience has unknowingly been harboring feelings for Martha for several years.

Dave turns up for his promised payrise the next day, only Gus has fallen asleep and has another erotic dream… about Dave, who he immediately throws out of his office the moment he wakes up.

-   _Frasier_: Frasier dreams about Gil Chesterton but eventually realizes his subconscious is providing a mystery for his lately-underused psychoanalytical skills. Parodied immediately afterwards, when he then has the same dream but featuring Sigmund Freud.
-   Played with on _Friends_, where Rachel dreams that she had sex with both Chandler and Joey, and sometimes she was just watching them. At first, they are interested but then they get squicked out.
-   _Hacks_: Ava has one about Deborah. Due to her being bisexual, this isn't that unusual, though Ava still feels uncomfortable because Deborah is her boss and straight.
-   _How I Met Your Mother_:
    -   Ted lies to Barney and Marshall about having a homoerotic dream about his "best friend". Since one of them is Ted's best friend is a point of contention between the two, they end up arguing about which one of them Ted would prefer to have sex with.

-   A post-plot audio drama for _Kamen Rider Drive_ has Go Shijima being placed into a dream sequence by an old AI of Krim Steinbelt named Hypnos, where he finds himself dating Chase. He initially dismisses it as Hypnos messing around until it tells him that dreams are a reflection of how you see other people, leading him to realize that he is in fact gay and is genuinely in love with Chase. Unfortunately, this takes place after Go had spent the whole series rebuffing Chase for being a biomechanical Roidmude and downplaying his heroics, eventually taking what is now recontextualized as their Belligerent Sexual Tension to the grave when Tenjuro Banno kills Chase.
-   _Red Dwarf_: Lister, finally beginning to miss Rimmer, dreams that he returns and they start making out. Naturally we're not let on to the fact that it is a dream until Lister falls out of bed screaming. Scene.
-   On _Robin Hood_, Guy of Gisborne has a dream about Maid Marian massaging his shoulders, who then turns into Allan-a-Dale. The actors express their bafflement on the DVD commentary, and not even the man who wrote the scene can adequately explain what's going on.

    Music 

    Theatre 

-   _Avenue Q_: Dramatic example with Rod's dream about Nicky confessing to him. Rod was already worried that he was gay, but this dream confirms that to him, as well as makes him realise that he has a crush on Nicky. The reveal that it was All Just a Dream is notable for being one of the saddest moments in the whole show.

    Video Games 

-   In _Sam and Max Season 3: The Penal Zone_, there is an optional cutscene if you try to "use engagement ring on Max", which causes Sam to have a De Beers commercial-style fantasy about getting down on one knee and tenderly placing the ring on Max's finger…
    
    **Sam:** Nah.
    

    Webcomics 

-   _Awkward Zombie_ plays with this trope in one strip. Marth has a dream in which he is putting up with Roy until Roy suddenly lunges forward and lip-locks him to the floor. It turns out, Mewtwo was controlling Marth's dream telepathically for fun.
-   In _Chester 5000 XYV_, the Inventor has a dream where a robotic version of his wife (this being chronologically well before the first sex robot is built) becomes a robotic version of George.
-   Amber from _Khaos Komix_ had a dream of her and her best friend Nay as Sailor Senshi, which also led to her realization that she is a lesbian.
-   Chapter 4 of _Lily Love_ opens with Donut having a sexual dream about her friend Mew, after previously having her accidentally fall on top of her a few days prior.
-   Ash from _Misfile_ has an Erotic Dream that can be called lesbian by terms of the bodies involved, but it's complex.
-   In _Nerf NOW!!_ Morgan and Angie have the same erotic dream about each other. Morgan blames Tentajo for it, yelling at him to stop making her do weird things (to be fair, her objection was over the erotic part, not the homo part) and Angie apparently has enough homoerotic dreams to make a bingo card, in which Engie-tan and the other Nerf Now girls made bingo. Anne's disgust at being the subject of many of Angie's wet dreams is forgotten when she learns Angie hadn't dreamed about Anne's sister Victoire once. And then Victoire shows off the photoshoot she did for a gun magazine...
-   _Penny and Aggie_:
    -   Penny has a dream of being in a bisexual three-way relationship with Duane and Aggie after her best friend tells her she thinks Penny's rivalry with Aggie stems from massive amounts of UST.
    -   Much later, after Penny and Aggie have become friends, she dreams of flying through clouds shaped like Aggie in the nude, while her gay friends suggest stereotypical fashions for her to wear. The dream ends with Cyndi urging her to "Taste the rainbow!" (and soaking her with a rainbow-producing hose) while a naked Aggie and Lisa look on. Upon awakening, she leafs uneasily through a _Manmeat Monthly_ magazine.
-   Gabe of _Penny Arcade_ has recurring dreams of being saved by Spider-Man. Gabe, uh, is a little more happy than you might expect, and a later comic gets even more intimate.
-   Christophe of _Sandra on the Rocks_ keeps falling into what are strictly speaking erotic waking fantasies involving his (rather geeky) friend Alex. As Christophe is normally a classic (if good-natured) heterosexual Jock/Casanova, this is very confusing for him.
-   Ethan from _Shortpacked!_, before he comes to the realization that he is gay, has one of these involving Rob Corddry and the rest of the cast of _The Daily Show_.
-   The vampire Rabbit from _Skins_ has a very explicit homoerotic bondage dream \[1\] about Tyr, one of the werewolf soldiers. So explicit that when Rabbit meets Tyr in the elevator the next day, he can't look him in the eye. This is made even funnier when Tyr asks if Rabbit slept well the night before and Rabbit blurts out that he didn't sleep, never mind dream and he certainly didn't dream anything about Tyr!!
-   In _Tiger, Tiger_, a conversation between Remy and Jamis in the interlude between Chapter 3 and 4 of Book 2 abruptly transitions from Remy talking to Remy stripping off his trousers and climbing into Jamis's lap. And then _Ludo_ appears, naked apart from a blanket that doesn't fully cover her chest, technically making this more of a "bierotic" dream.
-   _YU+ME: dream_ :
    -   Fiona has a homoerotic dream about her best friend Lia that leads her to question her sexuality. She hardly sleeps for a while because of it.
    -   In fact, _the entire first book_ is a Homoerotic Dream, albeit not about anyone in particular.
    -   Played for Drama in the case of Ellie, who has these inflicted on them by Sadako. It ultimately results in them being Driven to Suicide.

    Web Original 

-   This actually initiates the main relationship in _Ilivais X_. Granted, Mille was having this dream right after Iriana saved her from being killed or becoming a sex slave, so it's relatively justified.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_ has Joey having two homoerotic dreams about Kaiba, with Joey dressed as a dog. Also started the Running Gag about Joey being a furry.

    Western Animation 

-   In early episodes of _The Simpsons_, Smithers had this kind of dream about Mr. Burns. The original plan may not have been to make him strictly gay, but the character definitely developed in that direction.
-   _Undergrads_ features one, where tough-guy dumbass Rocco has one about his Kavorka Man friend Cal (whom he regularly despises and beats on).
-   In _The Venture Brothers_, one of the members of the organization SPHINX mentions having one during a Truth-Telling Session.
    
    "I had an erotic dream about Henry Rollins last night, and I'm straight as an arrow!"
