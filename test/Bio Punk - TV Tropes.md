Bio Punk combines Punk Punk with Organic Technology and Bio-Augmentation, usually centered around genetic engineering and biotechnology. Expect to see a lot of Organic Technology, sculpted physiques and Beast Men walking around... or hopping, swimming, flying, slithering, etc. Many buildings and ships will be grown, and a general Womb Level aesthetic will usually prevail. Issues examined may include Designer Babies, What Measure Is a Non-Human?, what _is_ human, various aspects of ecology and effects of modified crops/animals/bacteria. And you'll see Aesops (particularly Green Aesops about creating what you can't control), both real and Fantastic.

It should be noted that the line between Bio Punk and Cyberpunk is very thin, and the majority of cyberpunk stories will contain some limited Bio Punk elements. The line between Bio Punk and Post-Cyberpunk is sometimes even thinner and less gross, with Post-Cyberpunk sharing many more elements with Biopunk in addition to not using as many Cyberpunk elements as its precursor due to being a Fuzzy concept. And the last one is between Bio Punk and Solar Punk, which will usually use some elements but instead as a good thing.

In addition, proto-Bio Punk stories long predate Cyberpunk, with stories like Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_ and H. G. Wells's _The Island of Doctor Moreau_, making this one of the oldest subgenres of Science Fiction.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _AKIRA_ involves military scientists working on creating telepaths.
-   _Battle Angel Alita_ features this in Venus, where everything is biological: furniture, vehicles, and clothes. All of them are genetically engineered, and based on human DNA.
-   _Elfen Lied_ revolves around the Diclonius, a mutant species created by genetic manipulation, and how they're treated by humans in society.
-   _Genocyber_ is a pulpy (in more ways than one) take on a lot of the more squicky themes from _AKIRA_. The second story arc features a Womb Level, to boot.

-   _Guyver_, partly because of being an Darker and Edgier Homage/Deconstruction of Toku shows like _Kamen Rider_, falls pretty well into the \[proto-\]Biopunk niche (every single bit of advanced tech surrounding the Guyvers and their enemies are at least in-part biotechnology, if not entirely biotech).

-   _Majuu Sensen_ deals with human/animal hybrids created by scientists.
-   _Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind_ has this as a Lost Technology from the time before the apocalypse. The Dorok Empire hoard some of the most advanced secrets of it jealously, though other powers seek to claim it as well. The infamous "God Warriors" that strode the land during the apocalypse are prime examples, being gigantic humanoid Living Weapons that have Wave-Motion Gun Breath Weapons and lethally irradiate the environment around them.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: A thorough deconstruction of the Humongous Mecha genre, except all the humongous mecha, are actually alternate forms of life to humanity that share the same, alien, origin.
-   _REDLINE_ features this when we are introduced to Roboworld; many of its weapons feature Organic Technology.
-   The setting of _Toriko_ dabbles in this, with Toriko and the rest of the Four Kings getting their power from having been injected with special Gourmet Cells, and a division of IGO dedicated to cloning and reviving extinct animals.
-   The technology of the North in _Xam'd: Lost Memories_ consists of this, including the titular Xamd.

    Comic Books 

-   _Elephantmen_ deals with human-animal hybrids created in a war between Africa and China, and their struggle to reintegrate into society being essentially former child soldiers.
-   _Finder_ fits into this very well, being set in an After the End scenario where a biotech-based civilization collapsed, but many of its products, being self-reproducing living things, are still around.
-   _Iron Man_, while closer to Cyberpunk and the tech end of the spectrum in general, deals heavily in Transhuman themes and overlaps with this trope with the original _Extremis_ storyline and Tony's self-enhancement with titular technology (originally nanotech that played with LEGO Genetics, later a virus) to be faster, stronger, a technopath, and contain much of the armor in his bones. This was later upgraded to the 'Bleeding Edge' armor, where Nanomachines were contained inside his body and could transform into his armor at a mere thought — and unlike previous versions, didn't have motors and servos, but a kind of artificial muscle. This had downsides, however, as it at one point allowed Ultron to possess him and transform his body into a replica of Janet Van Dyne's, and because of this/since Status Quo Is God, it was eventually purged.
-   _Orc Stain_ is set in a world where nearly _all_ technology is Organic Technology, even when it makes no sense. Everything is a living organism of some kind, from weapons to _soda cans_, and the distinction between flesh and machine may as well not exist.
-   In _Prophet_, most of the Earth Empire's technology is a mix of biological/technological weaponry, not to mention the veritable army of genetically modified clone soldiers.
-   In _SCI-Spy_, apparently genetic modification with animals/aliens whatever is apparently so mainstream that being a normal Joe attracts prejudice.
-   This is the core of the technology in the future colony setting of Adam Warren's _Titans: Scissors, Paper, Stone_, with a smattering of Cyberpunk (like the ubiquitous neural jacks and Prosthetic Lass herself), but the biotech is the main emphasis, even forming the basis of the future slang used.
-   The _X-Men_ series and its spinoffs trade pretty heavily in biopunk themes. _X-Men (2019)_ has particularly emphasized it, with Sentinels — especially Omega Sentinels (cyborgs) and the like — being the ultimate enemies of mutantkind. Additionally, one of the future timelines (the 6th life of Moira MacTaggert) shows how while mutants surpassed humans through evolution, a third species, _Homo Novissima_, surpassed them both, because evolution became unnecessary once humans could alter themselves and their genetics however they wished, rather than relying on a random process.

    Fan Works 

-   _Child of the Storm_ features the X-Men and Iron Man heavily, including many attempts to recreate the Super-Soldier formula (with mixed success), and includes the Extremis virus, which is used by Arnim Zola to turn HYDRA mooks into Elite Mooks. The sequel, however, really focuses on it with the introduction of Sinister, who specialises in genetic manipulation and cloning, achieving, among other things; a Hive Mind of himself, which Doctor Strange later hacks and uses to hunt down all but the original, who's off the grid; clone Scott Summers and alter the clone's DNA to create Gambit and later alter it again when his powers start to malfunction; and create the Techno-Organic Virus that canonically infects Cable and here, infects Harry. More generally, the increasing options for DIY superhumans are noted In-Universe to be a developing problem, especially in places that don't have homegrown superhumans and want a deterrent of their own.

    Films — Animated 

-   At first, _Gandahar_ seems like a low-tech world with Bizarre Alien Biology. However, most of them are the result of human bioengineering.
-   _Pokémon: The First Movie_ revolves around the creation of Mewtwo, an artificial Pokémon created by reverse-engineering the Legendary Pokémon Mew. It doesn't turn out well; his story once provided the page quote for Gone Horribly Right.
    
    _"We dreamed of creating the world's strongest Pokémon... and we succeeded."_
    

    Films — Live-Action 

Examples by creator:

-   Much of David Cronenberg's work, particularly:
    -   _Shivers (1975)_, in which a scientist accidentally creates a sexually transmitted Puppeteer Parasite, causing, in turn, a Zombie Apocalypse of rape zombies.
    -   _Rabid_, in which an experimental skin graft creates a sort of Bio Punk vampire, whose victims all become rabid zombies and attack Montreal.
    -   _The Brood_, in which a revolutionary psychiatric method results in hideous bodily mutations.
    -   _Scanners_, in which a pharmacological error creates a Bizarre Baby Boom of socially-maladjusted, creepy psychics.
    -   _Videodrome_, in which warring ideologies use communications technology to mutate viewers into monstrous pawns.
    -   _The Fly (1986)_, in which a failed teleportation experiment fuses Jeff Goldblum and... well, a fly.
    -   _Naked Lunch_ is Bio Punk via The Beat Generation, with sentient typewriters, giant bugs, and monsters who give you tremendous creativity in exchange for blowjobs.
    -   _eXistenZ_, in which genetically engineered amphibians are used to create Organic Technology video game hardware to get into a virtual world, similar in concept to The Matrix.

Examples by work:

-   There's a successful Kickstarter sci-fiction short film literally named _Biopunk_ that take place in 2054, where the United Kingdom suffered massive depopulation by an unnamed virus. Afterward this resulted in the majority who did survive the outbreak becoming a new species named 'Altereds'. The main plot is around a woman named Resha trying to find her younger brother Kio who's been taken by an extremist group of Altereds.
-   _Dark City_ has a primarily Diesel Punk aesthetic, but dips heavily into Bio Punk when it hits the story points about artificial manipulation of memories and aliens playing Puppeteer Parasite with human corpses. The creators of _BioShock_ have named it as a primary aesthetic influence on their games.

-   _Jurassic Park (1993)_ is perhaps the Trope Codifier for modern audiences and was a huge box office success. The story focuses heavily on the themes of scientific ethics, man's hubris and the force of nature being beyond our control.
-   The rebooted _Planet of the Apes_ films focus on highly genetically engineered evolved apes that take over the world, mutated and aided by a man-made viral agent that kills 90% of the human population. This becomes a little worse in the third film of the Continuity Reboot as a seemingly new type of agent merges that scrambled/damaged human neurological/mental skills back into a primitive state (well, at least for older survivors, while younger survivors just get limited symptoms in the case of "Nova").

-   _Repo! The Genetic Opera_ plays this with a healthy helping of Cyberpunk and Gorn.
-   In _Shin Kamen Rider: Prologue_, the Cyborg Soldiers are genetically modified mutant super-soldiers created by the Foundation through intense gene therapy to be used in their intent to Take Over the World. The Hero itself also happens to be one who was infused with grasshopper DNA that allows him to transform into a rather monstrous-looking titular rider.
-   _Splice_ is about scientists take care their genetically modified hybrid without being caught by their pharmaceutical company.

    Literature 

Examples by creator:

-   One of the trademarks of Paolo Bacigalupi short stories and books.
    -   _Pump Six and Other Stories_ comes with few different flavors. The bio-punk elements don't exist just for aesthetics of the setting, but rather provide the pivotal issue of given short story or important plot devices:
        -   _Pocketful of Dharma_ has an organic city, growing like a tree and creating protective membranes around itself, sheltering its residents from poverty and pollution around.
        -   _The Fluted Girl_ brings it to Body Horror territory, as the titular girl has her entire body (along with her twin sister) turned into a music instrument, allowing the twins to play each other. If that's not enough, then there is the head of security, Burson, a military-grade mix of human, jackal, dog and nanotechnology, with Chameleon Camouflage skin. Most of the "aristocracy" is made from Really 700 Years Old people that keep revitalising their bodies to stay in charge and alter bodies of their serfs according to their whims.
        -   _The People of Sand and Slag_ come with Bio-Augmentation so extensive, the resulting trans-humanity can sustain itself on titular sand and slag, regrown lost limbs in matter of hours, breath toxic fumes with no problem and generally gain Nigh-Invulnerability. The result is society of people that don't even understand what pain is and that can be (and are) completely indifferent to living in a Gaia's Lament hellhole, because they don't need anymore sustainable environment to continue their existence. There is also a dog in it.
        -   _The Calorie Man_ and _Yellow Card Man_ are set In a World… where handful of seed-making MegaCorps patented their strains of plants and sent artificial plagues to wipe out any other grains used in agriculture. If that wasn't enough, the world exhausted all oil it had somewhere in-between, so the calories derived from grain are the new currency, providing badly needed energy.
        -   _Pop Squad_ has medicine and genetic manipulation so advanced, humanity essentially becomes immortal, but to avoid overpopulation, procreation and having kids is the highest offense against the law. The titular Squad hunts down women crazy enough to get pregnant, while its officers struggle with understanding why would anyone want to have kids.
        -   _Small Offerings_ takes place in a world so extremely polluted that pregnancies must be done in two stages. The first one, known as "prenatal" is about using the fetus as a sponge for toxins within mother's body and dumping the resulting mass of cancerous cells into a biohazard bin. Then getting the real, second pregnancy. Yeah.
    -   _The Windup Girl_ is set in a futuristic Post-Peak Oil Thailand where calories are the most important resource and genetically engineered organisms, including Synthetic Plagues, are common.
-   Genetic and ecological engineering play major roles in Paul McAuley's _The Quiet War_, and indeed in most of his later work.
-   Seanan McGuire's _Parasitology_ revolves around a genetically engineered tapeworm designed to keep people healthy that winds up integrating itself into people's brains and setting off a Zombie Apocalypse. Her _Newsflesh_ trilogy, about what civilization would be like after a Zombie Apocalypse if it didn't collapse, also counts.
-   This seems to be a favorite trope of Jeff VanderMeer.
    -   The _Ambergris_ stories, especially _Finch_, are Urban Fantasy Biopunk, or perhaps Spore Punk, with the Graycaps' fungus-based high technology that almost passes for magic, as far as the humans are concerned. Hell, in _Finch_, we even get _fungus-cyborgs_ in the form of the Partials.
    -   _Borne_ is set in a Bio Punk post-apocalypse, in a city where the biotech creations of a defunct company like memory-altering beetles, giant security leviathans, and alcoholic minnows are facts of life.
    -   The short story/novella _The Situation_ is set in a close-to-surreal near-future utterly transformed by biopunk... with a large dose of Incompetence, Inc. and related tropes thrown in for good measure. The world described is most definitely _not_ a nice place to live — the story verges on full-out horror in places, made all the more disturbing by the cold, bureaucratic tone in which much of it is told.

Examples by work:

-   The _Bas-Lag Cycle_, though closer to Dungeon Punk, has elements of this with the ReMade: bio-thaumaturges can warp flesh, bone and biology to heal, remake a being as something new, or (far, far more often) to punish.

-   _Bel Dame Apocrypha_ is set in the far future on a planet where descendants of Muslim colonists have split into two warring countries. Since this world is arid, water intensive animal husbandry isn't used. Instead, insects have been engineered to be the main source of protein and the level of genetic engineering is so advanced, the insects have become replacements for electronic equipment. Also, there are humans who have evolved on this world with the ability to control these insects via pheromones. The war between the two countries also makes extensive use of biological warfare, it's reached a point where the population has to regularly be checked and operated on for cancerous growths.
-   Nikko in Linda Nagata's _The Bohr Maker_ is genetically engineered to survive in the vacuum of space. Likewise, the police dogs of the Commonwealth are a mixture of bio-engineering and cybernetic augmentation.
-   _Brave New World_ centers around cloning, genetic manipulation and their impact on society. Arguably the Trope Codifier.
-   In the backstory of _The Broken Earth Trilogy_, there was a very large city known as Syl Anagist where the infrastructure and vehicles of were designed by genetically engineering plants and occasionally animals; houses are made completely out of living material, for example. This is helped by the people there being able to use magic from living things as the source of their technology.
-   In the _Burton & Swinburne Series_, everyday technology has been advanced by the Technologist caste with the two main branches being the steampunk Engineers and the biotech Eugenicists. Among the Eugenicists' standard innovations have been the specially bred dogs and parakeets used for sending messages, giant swans that tow people on kites, draft horses capable of hauling house-sized weights, and the broom cat — a shaggy cat that slides across the floor trapping dirt in its fur which it then eats. The Eugenicists have also developed transplanting brains and life extension treatments.
-   _Change Agent_ by Daniel Suarez, set 20 Minutes into the Future in 2045 where CRISPR has set off a biological version of the Industrial Revolution, is about an Interpol cop transformed into the criminal he was pursuing.
-   _The Dawnhounds_ features alchemical botany: splicing is a normal part of society in Hainak. Giant mushrooms are a form of cheap housing, and the plot is built around an engineered plague.
-   _Dune_ has the Bene Tleilax, who specialize in all things bio punk and all the horrible, nefarious ways in which they can be used — usually for the purposes of political intrigue and skullduggery.
-   The world in _The Egg Man_ is an alt-history variation where much of the biological weirdness comes from the way that humans evolved differently (the "bio" part) and how that has caused the rise of a modern society much more callous and selfish than the real one (the "punk" part). However, it also involves such things as people being employed as living computers, with their brains being artificially expanded to be larger than their entire bodies.
-   _Eve and Adam_ is about a girl (Eve) who tries to genetically engineer the perfect boy (Adam). Said boy comes to life about halfway through the novel. Also, Eve herself is genetically engineered to have a Healing Factor.

-   _Gene Wars_ covers the life of a guy named Evan, from making genetically engineered amoebas when he was eight to dying as essentially the last ordinary human.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_ takes place in the present day, but time-traveler Mikuru Asahina implies that future technology will evolve along these lines.

-   Shit Narnia in _John Dies at the End_, which is an alternate Earth where technology branched off into this in the mid 19th century. It's also where Eldritch Abomination and Big Bad Korrok was born.
-   The _Leviathan_ series has fabricated Beasties created after Darwin discovered the "Threads of Life". Also uses LEGO Genetics.
-   _The Lords of Creation_: The novel _In the Courts of the Crimson Kings_ is set on _John Carter of Mars_\-type world made plausible with Bio Punk technology given to the Martians by Ancient Astronauts.
-   The _Maximum Ride_ series skirt this genre, with the protagonists being genetically engineered bird people that were created by immoral scientists in order to find the secrets of immortality.
-   _Monster Blood Tattoo_ seems to cross this genre with Steampunk and a healthy dose of nightmares.
-   The _Moreau Series_ is a perfect example. The protagonist is Nohar Rajasthan, a half-tiger-half-human private investigator in a world where hybrid "Moreaus" (as in _The Island of Doctor Moreau_) are confined to ghettos as second-class citizens. The series also has genetically improved humans, called "Franks" as in _Frankenstein_, and aliens.
-   Genetic augmentations are abundant in _The Nexus Series_, for both combat and cosmetic purposes. Just don't go around using them in the US...

-   _Oryx and Crake_ and its sequel _The Year of the Flood_ are set in the near future and feature many bio-engineered animals, most notably pigs who can grow human organs for use in transplants.
-   _The Relic_ is about a Tragic Monster that Was Once a Man going on a rampage in a museum.
-   _Slimer_ involves genetically turning a great white shark into a shapeshifting unstoppable killing machine.
-   _This Mortal Coil (2018)_ focuses strongly on the setting's super-advanced 'gentech' Bio-Augmentation technology (which literally allows DNA to be rewritten as though it were code), and all of its potential applications and implications, for good and for bad. _Technically_ it's not a straight example of the trope, given that gentech is powered by Nanomachines which generate cybernetic components inside the body, as well as enabling almost-unlimited genetic modification capabilities.
-   The setting of _Twig_ is an Alternate History where instead of writing _Frankenstein_, Mary Shelley successfully invented an actual Frankenstein's monster. This dramatically changed the history of human technology development, and by the time the book starts in 1921 the rich can buy Stitched for use as personal servants, students at the Academy of Evil are giving themselves bio-augmentations, and the British Crown controls a third of the world through an army of monsters.
-   _Under a Freezing Moon_ combines this with Magitek, as a Mad Scientist pieces together dead bodies, re-animates them and turns them loose.
-   _West of Eden_ is set in an Alternate History where dinosaurs never went extinct and the Earth is dominated by the reptilian Yilanè, who use specially bred creatures as everything from microscopes to submarines.
-   _Wolfish Nature_ takes place in an Alternate History where humans evolved from dogs instead of apes. For unexplained reasons, dog-humans became masters of genetic engineering and focused all scientific efforts on this area instead of developing "dead" technology. By the 20th century, all devices, buildings, and even common things like _paper_ are grown instead of manufactured and require regular sustenance (when was the last time you fed your house or computer?). All our familiar dog breeds are still there, despite a good number of them being the result of human breeding programs in Real Life. This is also explained by the early days of genetic engineering when plenty of Mad Scientists hid in their castles (yes, this happened in the Middle Ages) and tried to mess with dog-human DNA to improve their clans. "Dead" technology is a fairly recent development, as some inventions are better at their job than their "selected" (i.e., grown devices) counterparts, computers being the most obvious example. One of the greatest triumphs of genetic engineering is the so-called Bio-Correction, which took place hundreds of years ago and removed the "wolf gene" from every dog-human, removing their ability to kill without remorse. Anyone who even manages to kill another person is either insane or will go crazy and/or commit suicide. The Bio-Correction (which is a big lie of the Clap Your Hands If You Believe variety) results in a world with no wars, where murder is an extreme rarity, but where espionage has been elevated to an art form, and spies are the only ones specifically trained to kill without going crazy afterward. Interestingly, the author chooses to focus on the "espionage" part, simply using the Biopunk as a setting.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Babylon 5_, Bio-Tech is the purview of the most advanced races. The Vorlon and Shadow ships are stated to be bio-ships, and it's hinted through their aesthetics, similar to those of the Vorlons and Shadows, that so are the other First One ships. To raise the tech level of their client races (Minbari for the Vorlons and Drakh for the Shadow) they grant them bio-tech (mostly ships' armor). It's also heavily implied in the last episode of season 4 that bio-tech is also the future of human technology as a human from AD 1000000 is shown boarding a bio-ship right before the Sun goes nova.
-   _Dollhouse_ is all about messing with the human brain.
-   _Farscape_ features heaps of organic technology (from the Translator Microbes to the Living Ships), and quite a few plots revolve around genetic manipulation.
-   _Kamen Rider_:
    -   _Kamen Rider Gaim_: Helheim fruits alter the eater's DNA, converting them into an Inves. While it proves a Deadly Upgrade for most people, in Kouta and Kaito's cases, exposure to the Forbidden Fruit and a virus carried by the Inves (respectively) ultimately led to Kouta's upgrade into a human-looking Overlord and Kaito's transformation, triggered by his devouring a Helheim fruit, into a monster Overlord form called Lord Baron.
    -   _Kamen Rider Amazons_, a web show loosely based on one of the Showa Era heroes, features monsters and Riders as a result of a biological lab experiment gone horribly wrong. A far cry from the supernatural mystics and ancient Mayan science of the original.
-   _Kidou Keiji Jiban_ has the Japanese-based Bioron, which has its monsters created due to genetic tests conducted by Kenzo Igarashi.
-   _Orphan Black_ is all about human cloning and eventually genetic modification, exploring the ethical consequences thereof. This is most pronounced with the Neolutionists, a biotechnological faction who believe strongly in humanity using technology to take control of its own evolution, and who play a major role in the ominous Dyad Institute. Also, it contains lots of icky medical research and cybernetic-like biotechnological modified maggots implanted in people's cheeks in one episode.

    Pinballs 

-   _Centaur_ may well be an Ur-Example, as the title creature depicted on the backglass is a mix of human, horse, and Organic Technology motorcycle.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Cyberpunk_ has such stuff, albeit (at least in the rulebook) in considerably fewer numbers than Cyberware and like the latter cost Humanity Points (though not as many).
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: The _Lords of Madness_ source book includes a "Fleshwarper" prestige class, designed for creating this sort of thing in a Heroic Fantasy setting.
-   _Eclipse Phase_ is Post-Cyberpunk, but most of the modifications available are biological in nature, and bio-morphs (bodies which are fundamentally organic, but still often weird) are culturally preferred over Synth-Morphs (robot bodies, derogatorily called the "Clanking Masses") or Pods (half-synth, half-biological bodies; the name comes from the derogatory "Pod-People", a riff on how the biological parts of the bodies are grown). For an example of the sort of bio-mods you can get in this game, see the Sex Switch — which switches your sex at will — or Eelware — electric eel cells for powering electronics or zapping enemies. There are also bio-engineered Space Whales that live in the corona of the sun.
-   _GURPS_:
    -   The supplement _GURPS Bio-Tech_ is all about Biopunk.
    -   The _Transhuman Space_ setting has Biopunk elements, including bioroids (biological androids), bioshells (biological bodies controlled by AIs or ghosts), parahumans and genetically engineered oddities such as pharm goats (goats that produce drugs in their milk). 4th Edition _Bio-Tech_ is heavily informed by _Transhuman Space_, which in turn was based on the vignettes in 3rd Edition _Bio-Tech_.

-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
    -   The aesthetic of the Simic Combine is something reminiscent of this, although not to the same extent as some of the other examples on the page. They are, in essence, to Biopunk what their cousins the Izzet League are to Steampunk.
    -   Phyrexia as a whole is also partly focused on this, though actual technology and metal, oil and _severe_ Body Horror make it verge on conventional Cyberpunk.
-   _Psionics: The Next Stage in Human Evolution_ includes drugs that release psionic power in individuals with the genetic potential for it, to say nothing of all of the lab-made monstrosities in the game.
-   _Rifts_:
    -   The Coalition State of Lone Star worries the other states, as they create anthropomorphic animals and employ them around their labs and other secure facilities; however, the other states do approve of their output of Dog Pack Mutants, which fill out the lower ranks of the Coalition military.
    -   _Atlantis_ has Bio-wizardry, which can use imprisoned magical creatures to power Techno-wizard devices and create superpower-granting parasites and symbiotes, up to large-scale replacement of body parts with such symbiotes, creating a "bio-borg".
    -   The _Lemuria_ book shows the Lemurians making their sea homes with Biomancy, magic Organic Technology that is a lot more kinder to the living beings involved than the Splugorth Bio-Wizardry, along with armor and weapons. The Jungle Elves of Maga Island in South America use a more primitive form of the magic.
-   _Shadowrun_ offers Bioware, genetically modified cultured tissue that can be implanted in characters in much the same way as Cyberware. Bioware can provide the same benefits as cyberware, or other benefits, and eats up less Essence, but bioware is considerably more expensive much harder to replace.
-   _Splicers_ has an AI decide to take over the world and turn every piece of metal against humanity. The surviving free humans re-engineer their entire civilization around the use of Organic Technology, replacing with bio-engineered organisms their weapons, Powered Armor, AFVs, warships, aircraft, and Humongous Mecha.
-   In _The Splinter_, symbiotic and living weapons aren't all that uncommon.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_ absolutely _adores_ this trope. If we listed all the examples that its universe boasted, we'd be here until the cows came home. Special mention goes to the Dark Mechanicum and the Drukhari, however, who take it to Brain Bleach levels of intensity.

    Theatre 

-   Older Than Television: In _R.U.R._, 1921, the eponymous robots are not mechanical, but rather artificially created organic beings who rebel against their master.

    Video Games 

-   _Bio-Hazard Battle_ is about living ships navigating a world mutated by a global biowar to find a suitable place for the survivors of the war to build a colony and restart civilization.
-   This trope is a major theme in the _BioShock_ series, in which genetic engineering plays a vital role in the iconic underwater city of Rapture, where the first two games take place. Thanks to a powerful, but addictive mutagen called ADAM, the city was capable of developing gene-modifying injections that grant extraordinary abilities such as pyrokinesis, telekinesis, shooting bees out of your hands, etc., but at the price of addiction, insanity, and some truly nasty Body Horror resulting from both said abilities and ADAM withdrawal. Also, that bee-shooting superpower we mentioned? It turns your hand into a meaty beehive for bees to crawl in and out of. (While Bio Punk still plays a role in _BioShock Infinite_, the game doesn't give the consequences of genetic engineering as much attention as the previous entries, focusing more on Quantum Mechanics Can Do Anything.)
-   _Civilization: Beyond Earth_:
-   _Escape Velocity Nova_ features the human race of the Polaris, who grow starships and space stations of organic material.

-   _Fallout_ is about stopping the proliferation of super mutants, who used to be human before they were somehow transformed. Their spread throughout the wasteland is because the Master captures humans and exposes them to the Forced Evolutionary Virus to turn them into super mutants. He reasons that human biology is too weak to be able to last in the post-apocalypse, and mutations are necessary to prevent humanity from going extinct.
-   _Final Fantasy VII_ has numerous examples of bioengineered Super Soldiers.
-   _Fracture_ presents the world where the East and West coasts of the USA are split over biotech use. On the Pacific coast, gene modification and grown biotech is embraced as the key to humanity's survival in the post-climate change world, while on the Atlantic coast, it's banned and instead heavy use of cybernetics is the go-to future tech.
-   _Geneforge_ is this meets Dungeon Punk. The majority of people use Organic Magitek, which is exclusively produced by The Magocracy whose members are called Shapers. The process usually involves heavily modifying existing animals, plants and fungi. Oddly for a Bio Punk world (or any kind of Punk Punk as dark as _Geneforge_), the system enforced by Shaper control starts out between 'real-life democracy' and 'Post-Cyberpunk' in how bad it is despite being an Oligarchy; the one good trait they possess as a group is recognizing the responsibility behind the power to create life (they have all the right protocols to quarantine an island while remaining as humane as the real life CDC or WHO), and the main character is always a Shaper themselves working within the system as best they can... and then as the Shaper's creations go steadily out of control over the series, causing everything to get worse instead of better.
-   The _Guilty Gear_ setting has this as part of its backstory with the creation of the titular Gears, genetically and magically engineered living weapons that were eventually hijacked and controlled into revolting, leading to the Crusades. Even in the present, where most of the Gears have been wiped out, there are still some that continue to pop up and cause trouble. In fact, protagonist Sol Badguy is both one of the original creators of the Gears and the original Prototype Gear.
-   The _Half-Life_ series has plenty of elements like this, from the few weapons that are basically small weaponized aliens, to the Combine, whose army consists mainly of conscripts from their many, many Slave Races with various augments.
-   The main plot of the _Killing Floor_ series is to fight off feral British genetically enhanced clone mutants that are later revealed to be created by Dr. Kevin "The Patriarch" Clamely, the original owner of that biotech company that enemies come from, in order to wreak his vengeance against the government.
-   _Plague Inc._ offers mods in line with this genre: creating viruses that can make you a Splicer from the _BioShock_ series, turning uninfected humans into various monsters, or aimed at wiping out any remaining uninfected or unmodified humans.
-   _Policenauts_ has shades of this. There are multiple types of bio-engineered Artificial Human (such as the Frozeners and Rebirthers), gene therapy is used for everything from organ modification to gender reassignment, and the setting's most prominent crimes are the trafficking of genetically engineered heroin and black market organs.
-   _Altered Beast (2005)_ changes the simply magical nature of the original game's werebeasts to them being "Genome-Cyborgs" who can alter their DNA to let in animal features that make them anthropomorphic beasts. The enemies are also animals and humans who were killed and revived by a mutagen.
-   The _\[PROTOTYPE\]_ series, about viruses that cause severe changes to those infected with it — the protagonists become Monstrous Humanoids who mold their bodies into deadly appendages and absorb other people's flesh for healing.
-   _Quake IV_ makes heavy usage of this trope with the Strogg's technology, which involves the fusion of captured humans with their cybernetics, especially the Stroggification process.
-   The _Resident Evil_ series is all about biotechnology gone wrong.
    -   The first three games are about a man-made zombie outbreak engineered by MegaCorp\-turned-terrorist group Umbrella Corporation, plus a couple of games that have mind control parasites as the true main villains, and also a few genetically engineered mutants created by a couple of groups throughout the series.
    -   The seventh game heavily implies that the true main antagonist Eveline was a genetically modified human-like mutant created by a different biotech corporation, who creates spores that put infected people under her mind control and turn the ones who stay under her control long enough into mutant-like slaves for her, as seen with the Baker family throughout the game. The sequel reveals that while the mold was cultivated by a Mad Scientist aristocrat, she was also one of the honorary founding members of Umbrella and was just as depraved as her student Spencer. Each of her minions uses a different type of parasitic creature to host the mold, resulting in the realization of classic folklore monsters to the townsfolk's detriment.
-   _Septerra Core_ is all about Organic Technology. The core of the planet in the game is a colossal biocomputer with spines. Maya's weapon grows its own bullets. Not only that, but there are also Living Ships, which are grown by using Helgak.
-   In _Technobabylon_, the field of Gengineering allows for easy manipulation of organisms' genes to create new species. Many of the characters' jobs involve altering existing plants and animals on a commercial scale. There also exists a restaurant that serves cloned human flesh. Also, there are organic nanomachines called "wetware" which are used for many different purposes.

    Webcomics 

-   Where to even **begin** in _Awful Hospital_? Here, keratin is used as money and wood. The shells of vitamin capsules are used as houses. You don't want to know what they make life rafts out of...

-   _Genocide Man_: Open-source biotechnology enabled terrorists to create Synthetic Plagues and genetic "deviants" designed as human weapons. In response, the UN formed the Genocide Project whose augmented geneticist-soldiers are sanctioned to exterminate deviancies and holders of hazardous ideas, down to the last man, woman, and child. The main plot of the story is how, despite the complete genetic rewriting of the human species and corresponding advanced technology, humanity hasn't fundamentally changed from its usual bastardy.
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   The alien troll race that makes up much of the cast uses a lot of technology modeled after/made out of insects. The computers (or 'husktops') are similar in shape to large purple and orange arthropods, complete with legs and carapace.
    -   The citizens of Alternia are a spacefaring race. The troll Empress's personal vessel, the Battleship Condescension, is powered by nonconsensual sapping of the psionic energy of a yellow-blood adult troll, who has had his life artificially extended indefinitely and been cybernetically integrated with the technology of the ship. Doc Scratch implies that _all_ adult psionics are conscripted (read: forced) into being Living Batteries for the ships belonging to trolls of higher status.

    Western Animation 

-   _Æon Flux_ inhabits a world where self-modification is the new makeup.
-   _Arcane_ has the Under City of Zaun, where body augmentations and replacements are rather common and are sometimes powered by the organically derived serum Shimmer.
-   _Batman Beyond_ has strong elements of this with the splicers and Kobra cult, who are heavily into Bio-Augmentation.
-   _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_ has the planet Rhizome, whose technology is based almost exclusively on genetically engineered plants (which is their way of living in harmony with nature, rather than perverting it). One episode, for instance, has Buzz and his crew switch out their normal Space Ranger hardware for plant-based suits to fight the energy-absorbing robot NOS-4-A2.

    Real Life 

-   It's not really a huge concern as of yet, but Western culture is well on the precipice of this being an actual thing in the not-too-distant future, with technologies such as the creation of organic body parts in labs being already being developed. The United Kingdom was the first nation to legalize the creation of babies from the DNA of three separate parents, and technology capable of actually modifying genes already exists (CRISPR, for example), although its capabilities are limited (for now).
    -   Cloning is already being carried out with animals on small levels, there are surgical gender reassignment operations and body modifications that use animal parts, which a few subcultures are adopting with punk and plastic surgery, touching on some of this trope.
    -   Looking forward, nanotechnology has gotten a huge boost by integrating with microscopic organisms, and there have been other breakthroughs, like a prototypical memory storage device utilizing salmon DNA.
        -   This type of technology even got its own Punk Punk in the OtherWiki when either Cybernetics or Bio-Augmentations are limited or banned put still retain some Biopunk elements.
    -   A company named Monsanto has been working hard to make this a reality in food for years since mid-20 century.
        -   It is worth noting that Monsanto is quite controversial in almost all cultures, and this is not necessarily a good thing.
        -   It is especially worth noting that exhaustive, dispositive scientific investigation has concluded that existing genetic modifications of food are safe for human health and for the biosphere.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Monsanto was purchased by Bayer in 2018, who retired the brand, although Bayer continues to produce the same products. However, research continues, and the context evinced by the preceding two bullets persists, in that the scientific consensus supports GM while a generally uncredentialed fringe opposes it. That being said, Monsanto has also engaged in some shady business practices and their heavy promotion of the use of pesticides has been linked to drastically decreased populations of bees and butterflies.
    -   GloFish, genetically engineered, brightly colored zebra danios that glow under U.V. light, have been legal to purchase as pets throughout the U.S. since 2003.
    -   Xenobots are biological robots created using the stem cells of frogs.
-   One can say this is Older Than Dirt, since agriculture depends upon the use of artificially created species. This is especially true for modern-day agriculture.
    -   Dog and horse breeding are also forms of genetic engineering that have been around for millennia.
-   Today, a number of substances (insulin for example) are fabricated using genetically engineered organisms, usually bacteria.
-   Raelism, a religious group founded in the early 1970's by former French racecar driver Claude Vorilhon. One of their religious dogmas involves using cloning and mind-transfers as a way of achieving immortality.
    -   Vorilhon actually created a corporation to research cloning, claiming at one point to have successfully cloned a human child. Considering the source, actual evidence is not forthcoming.
