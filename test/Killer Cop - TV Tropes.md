A member of law enforcement who also engages in murder. This person's motivations may range anywhere from monetary gain to exacting a form of street justice. Either way, expect this person to be much more dangerous than your average killer.

Note that despite the name, the Killer Cop isn't always an actual police officer. He (or she) may also be a civilian employee, such as a forensics expert or something. Also, if the Killer Cop _is_ an officer, their murders are obviously committed for a reason other than to maintain a cover identity. (Well, at least one hopes an undercover officer doesn't go to those lengths.)

If the Killer Cop is a Serial Killer, the observant viewer may recognize the following signs:

1.  The crime scenes are jarringly devoid of any incriminating evidence. Either the killer is a forensics expert and cleaned up so thoroughly that they got rid of the evidence or they are a savvy police officer who has investigated many crime scenes and knows how to avoid leaving evidence in the first place. Note: This is not always a given, as a Serial Killer who _isn't_ a member of law enforcement can avoid leaving evidence as well.
2.  If the killer is suspected to be copying the methods of another killer, the copy will be exactly like the original, even down to the details that only a member of law enforcement would know.
3.  If the killer is attempting to frame someone else for their crimes, the frame-up will be suspiciously thorough. The amount of evidence against the person will likely lead the viewer to two conclusions:
    1.  That a calculating TV Serial Killer wouldn't be stupid enough to leave that much evidence against themselves, meaning the suspect isn't the killer and
    2.  The _real_ killer has such intimate knowledge of evidence and police work that they must be a member of law enforcement. Like the first sign, this isn't a given, as it is possible to research forensics.

In Crime Dramas, this may be used as a Twist Ending, especially if the cop is the Villain Protagonist.

See also Detective Mole. The inverse of a Cop Killer, although the two tropes sometimes overlap — the Killer Cop may target other cops, or may himself become the Asshole Victim of a Cop Killer. Often a subtrope of The Bad Guys Are Cops and Dirty Cop.

Please be cautious when listing Real Life examples.

**Note:** A character can qualify for this even if they don't use their position or expertise to help with their murders. However, if they appear in a murder mystery, they probably will.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The Funimation Gag Dub of _Crayon Shin-chan_ has a Killer Cop _movie franchise_. According to the creator commentary, all they do is increment the number that comes after the name "Killer Cop" each time they mention a movie, and occasionally reframe the in-universe TV shows as a cop killing somebody.
-   Light Yagami, the Villain Protagonist of _Death Note_, joins the police force specifically to work on the investigation of his own murders, and get close enough to kill the Sympathetic Inspector Antagonist trying to catch him. It doesn't work so well the first time he tries, but the second attempt is much better.
-   _Jo Jos Bizarre Adventure Stone Ocean_: Ex-cop D an G believed in the Nostradamus prophecies and killed a few people he disliked in 1999, using his status as a cop to hide the evidence. When the world _didn't_ end in 2000, he was arrested and sentenced to 20 years, landing him in Green Dolphin Street Prison where he would eventually antagonise the protagonists.

    Comic Books 

-   Americop from _Captain America_.
-   In _Gotham Central_, Dirty Cop Jim Corrigan ultimately became this, murdering Crispus Allen. The _Not_\-Dirty Cop who became the Spectre after being murdered by gangsters was a completely different Jim Corrigan. Allen himself would also later do a turn as the Spectre. Given that the Spectre was one of the few DC Heroes who would intentionally kill criminals, often in rather gruesome ways, both of them probably technically count as well.
-   _Green Arrow_: Green Arrow fought a gang of cops known as the Vice Squad, who got together and used police equipment during their off-duty hours to eliminate what they saw as 'undesirable' elements off the streets. The leader made the mistake of assuming Green Arrow would agree with his crusade.
-   _Judge Dredd_:
    -   Wilson Priest, one of the judges featured in _The Pit_ arc is this. He murders a suspect after he repeatedly gets Off on a Technicality and begins to do it more often. Given the legal structure in the _Dredd_ universe, this overlaps with Hanging Judge.
    -   The Dark Judges are an especially extreme version, as they enforce the law by simply murdering every potential criminal, believing life to be the source of all crime. Eradicate life, eradicate crime.
    -   Several senior Judges used to be part of an extralegal killing squad known as the Citizens' Court, to kill criminals who fell through the cracks of the justice system.
-   _The Punisher_: In some continuities, Frank was a cop rather than a Vietnam veteran before turning to vigilantism (the Alternate Universe of _Spider-Gwen_ is a complicated example: he was a Marine, then a mercenary (for Tony Stark, of all people), then became a cop and his increasingly-insane crusade to get the titular vigilante had him blowing up a significant chunk of New York). In "Six Hours to Kill", he ends up in Baltimore, where (among others) he faces a kill-team of corrupt cops.
-   _Robin (1993)_: Roman Cavallo and Marcus Wise murdered two men to cover their tracks and try to kick off a turf war with the implication they weren't the blackmailing cops' first murders. They follow this up by hiring someone to assassinate Tim Drake in _Red Robin_ when they think he's going to reveal their corruption during a public speech about community building in Gotham.
-   The police in _Sin City_ (with the exception of Hartigan) are dirty as all get-out, but the ones sent after Marv are an out-and-out _death squad_ that murdered one of their own simply because she'd talked to Marv about what's been going on.

    Films 

-   _Acts of Vengeance (2017)_: It turns out Strode, a police officer, murdered Valera's wife and daughter for revenge as Valera got the man who murdered his own daughter off, which left him free to murder her. He kidnapped them with the pretext of a traffic stop.

-   The police death squad from _Magnum Force_. They contrast with Cowboy Cop Harry Callahan by being willing to murder not only people acquitted of crimes and other people they feel are criminals but also anyone with them, guilty or innocent. They're also not above killing other cops who either get too close to their operation or they feel needed to be sacrificed. The vigilante cops' indiscriminate behavior disgusts Harry.

On a drug bust early in the film, Stansfield goes on a drug rush and along with his men, murders Mathilda's family, including their baby brother, only caring about how he'll explain their deaths to his superiors. When Mathilda confronts him later on, Stansfield plans to kill her — implying that he'll enjoy doing it — before he's stopped by the news of the death of one of his subordinates. He later leads a raid on Leon's apartment to try to kill both him and Mathilda and shoots Leon in the back as the latter tries to escape only to meet his end by a pack of grenades.
-   _The Prowler_ turns out to be Sheriff George Fraser. The first two murder victims were his ex-girlfriend and her new love interest. The motive was apparently jealousy. The Prowler then became a serial killer, by going on a killing spree on the anniversary of the original murder. He was never seen as a suspect both because he was a respected authority figure, and because he supposedly had taken a vacation at the time of the spree. It was just an alibi.

-   In _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_, the T-1000 spends the majority of the film impersonating an LAPD officer.

-   Suggested but ultimately averted in _A Walk Among the Tombstones_. It appears that the Serial Killers hunted by the protagonist, ex-cop turned private eye Matthew Scudder, are with the Drug Enforcement Agency because they have police radios and DEA files on their victims. However, Scudder says they're too crazy to have gotten into the DEA, and suggests they were civilian employees who briefly had access to the files. Later, Scudder discovers one of their victims was an undercover DEA agent who had the files on her.
-   In _Wild Things_, Ray Duquette murders Kelly and stages it to make it look like self-defense, and conspired with Sam to (supposedly) kill Suzie, just to get his hands on the money acquired from the courtroom scam. As it turns out, it's not the first time either, as Ray murdered Suzie's best friend several years ago. His superiors accept his explanation of Kelly's death (meaning he's free of any murder or manslaughter charges), but fire him because it looks very suspicious either way.

    Literature 

-   The _Mercy Thompson_ offshoot series, _Alpha and omega_ features CNTRP agent Les Heuter of the novel _Fair Game_. By day, Les is seemingly a normal member of the government policing organisation CANTRIP (Combined Nonhuman and Transhuman Relations Provisors) which is in charge of investigating criminal cases involving non-humans such as fae and werewolves. By night though, Les is a brutal Serial Rapist and Serial Killer who brutally preys on female fae and werewolves and takes much pleasure in it.

-   In the Mario Puzo novel from which _The Godfather_ trilogy was mined, Albert Neri starts as an incorruptible but viciously Rabid Cop. Then he gets sent on a call to bring in Wax Barnes, a pimp who just slashed one of his girls _and her daughter_ — said call coming a few hours after Neri's wife has left him. Officer Neri thus earns his "promotion" to this trope.
-   _The Hate U Give_ is built on this, the plot kicking off when an officer kills Starr's childhood friend, who was unarmed and wasn't breaking any laws when they got pulled over. He gets away with it.
-   The protagonist from Jim Thompson's _The Killer Inside Me_.
-   Frank Ennunzio, FBI Forensic Linguist in Lisa Gardner's novel, _The Killing Hour_.
-   Robert Crais seems to like these: In _L.A. Requiem_, the killer who was framing Joe Pike turned out to be the guy who pushed the mail cart at police headquarters. In _Demolition Angel_, the person who murdered Charlie Riggio was his own partner on the Bomb Squad, Buck Daggett. In _The Two Minute Rule_, the man who murdered the four officers was William Cecil of the FBI Bank Squad.
-   In Richard Laymon's _Savage_, Roderick Whittle, aka Jack the Ripper, becomes a sheriff's deputy named "John Carver".
-   In Fred Vargas' _This Night's Foul Work_, Ariane, the medical examiner working with Adamsberg on his cases, is actually the one killing people and animals in the pursuit of a medieval ritual that will supposedly grant her immortality.

-   Norman Daniels in _Rose Madder_. He kills at least six people during the book (including two cops, three people who helped Rose, and a hooker), and while he's disposing of a hooker he strangled, he mentally comments it's not the first time, implying previous murders. He's also strongly suspected of killing an inconvenient victim of his own police brutality who was taking him and his department to court over it.

-   One of the 1970s-era _Columbo_ mysteries involved the Police Commissioner himself trying to get away with committing murder.
-   _Criminal Minds_:
    -   The first episode that features The Reaper leads you to think that this might be the case. The Reaper was a serial killer who had stopped killing for ten years, then started killing again. In the original run of murders, he had killed a bunch of people but left one victim alive. Ten years later, that victim was hiding from The Reaper by living at a number of different addresses and switching between them. At one of The Reaper's crime scenes, he left the victim's address numbers written on windows in blood, leading you to think that the lead detective from the local police department might be The Reaper. (Since he would've been one of the few people who knew the addresses, as they had been told to him by the victim.) However, this turns out not to be the case. In reality, the "victim" survived because he was The Reaper.
    -   Another episode features a cop that stages shootings so he can be the first to "save" the victim. Occasionally those victims die, but he is honored as a hero cop. He tries to kill Penelope when he thinks she is on to him.

    -   Detective Vega turned out to be a killer as well.
-   _CSI: NY_ had one of those, a cop that went dirty and murdered others to cover his tracks.
-   Detective Rick Messer, aka The Bearded Man in _Damages_, who acts as a hitman for a Corrupt Corporate Executive. Plays with this as it isn't revealed that he's a cop until late on.
-   _Dexter_:
    -   Of course, Dexter is one of these, although he's a forensic examiner rather than a detective. He was also trained by his adoptive father, who was already a cop but couldn't bring himself to actually kill criminals who escaped justice. In season 2 Dexter is the subject of an ongoing investigation when the corpses of his victims are discovered, which he manages to avoid by making it look like another cop within the department had turned to serial killing.
    -   Dexter also went after one in season four, a cop who'd killed her own husband and daughter and made it look like a robbery gone foul. She was a particularly hard target because her experience allowed her to suspect Dexter was up to something pretty early on.
-   _The Dukes of Hazzard_: The final season's "Cool Hands, Luke and Bo" has police officers who – it is strongly implied – have killed inmates in the past at the Osage Road Prison, where Bo, Luke, Rosco, and Boss Hogg are being held on false charges.
-   _The Equalizer_ had at least two episodes with officers as not so finest as such, "Lady Cop" and "Solo".
-   _Forever_: Detective Dunn in "Diamonds Are Forever" murders his partner in crime, and almost murders Jo.

-   _Homicide: Life on the Street_:
    -   One arc had Pembleton assigned to investigate the police shooting of an unarmed suspect by a rookie cop to figure out whether it was justified or not while facing backlash from his fellow officers for even investigating. Even the usually reasonable Giardello pressures him to ignore leads that implicate the police and nearly frames an innocent man before he realizes what he's doing. Pembleton eventually discovers that the rookie was covering up for his commanding officer, who had shot the suspect in the back when he tried to run away.
    -   Jake Rodzinski (played by guest star Bruce Campbell) is a cop who kills his ex-cop father's murderer for revenge when the murderer is sprung by a hung jury.
    -   Bayliss becomes one in the series finale when he performs a Vigilante Execution on Luke Ryland after he got off on a technicality.
-   _Law & Order_ and its various spin-offs have featured these on more than one occasion.

-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   _Agent Carter_ season 2 begins with a subversion, as Detective Henry disguises someone else's murder as a previous serial killer's work. The trope is later played straight as he tries to abduct someone and gets shot by another Corrupt Cop.
    -   _Daredevil_:
        -   In season 1,Wilson Fisk has numerous cops on his payroll. Among them are Emergency Service Unit officers who are so dirty that they're willing to murder _fellow officers_ who aren't on the take or become liabilities.
        -   Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter in season 3 is an FBI agent. Over the course of the season, Fisk slowly manipulates him and corrupts him into becoming his top assassin, impersonating Daredevil to discredit the vigilante who took Fisk down. Dex ends up being responsible for both major character deaths in season 3 (Father Lantom and Ray Nadeem), as well as a bunch of minor character deaths/hospitalizations (including Mitchell Ellison and Jasper Evans).
    -   _Jessica Jones_: Will Simpson is first introduced as a cop who is ordered by Kilgrave to attack Trish. After surviving an explosion, his sanity begins slipping, causing him to kill fellow detective Oscar Clemons and attack Trish and Jessica.
    -   _Luke Cage_: Misty Knight's partner Rafael Scarfe is in Cottonmouth's pocket. He kills Chico Diaz when Chico prepares to snitch on Cottonmouth.
    -   _The Punisher_: Carson Wolf "kills" David Lieberman by shooting him while claiming that David has a weapon. But he doesn't see that the bullet is stopped by the cell phone in David's breast pocket, and David subsequently fakes his death and goes underground.

-   _Narcos_: some police officers in Bogota decide to round up young men from the slums they suspect working for the cartels, and just summarily execute them into a ditch.
-   The 1992 Australian mini-series _Phoenix_ is about the investigation into a car bomb that exploded outside Victorian Police headquarters, killing a policewoman. The very first suspect the Major Crimes Squad is ordered to investigate is a police officer who allegedly made a threat to blow up the building. It turns out the whole thing was an argument blown out of proportion, and the officer had nothing to do with the bombing. Ironically the police rank-and-file are as willing to believe the rumor as anyone.
-   A subplot of _Queer as Folk (US)_ has Debbie finding the body of a strangled prostitute in a dumpster. The investigation is suspended because of "lack of evidence" before the police can even identify the victim, and he becomes known simply as "Dumpster Boy". Later, it turns out that the killer was a cop who frequently solicited male prostitutes, and the reason the investigation was shut down so quickly was that the killer, in a state of panic after having committed a murder by mistake, goes to his ex-partner and long-time friend, Police Chief Stockwell, and begs for help.
-   _Rizzoli & Isles_ had a detective who killed a bunch of women with the same names as the original Boston Strangler victims. His purpose in so doing was to frame the person he believed was really the Boston Strangler. He had worked the original murder case and didn't believe that the person who confessed was really the killer.
-   Vic Mackey in _The Shield_. He proves this when he shoots fellow officer Terry Crowley on a drug bust...in the _FIRST_ episode.
-   _Superior Court_: Several episodes of this late-1980s courtroom drama addressed police misconduct, including brutality. One of those episodes had a police officer on trial for murder after killing a man during a domestic disturbance call. After denying his actions, he finally snaps during an intense cross-examination ... and in the process recounts some very dark childhood memories of an abusive father who was always drunk and often beat both him and his mother ... until the night the mother locked her husband out of the house (during a blizzard) and left him to freeze to death. The officer declares he decided to go into law enforcement and never would allow another domestic abuser to get away with his crimes again. A jury finds the police officer guilty of manslaughter.
-   _Walker, Texas Ranger_: A 1997 episode "The Brotherhood" featured cops who – frustrated by the system – kill suspects before they've had their due process, and it results in an innocent man paying with his life after he had been wrongly accused of rape.
-   _Wild Bill_: Alex Blair, a police detective, committed multiple robberies, murdered a witness later, and framed another one for his crimes.
-   _Your Honor_: It turns out Michael's wife Robin was murdered for investigating gangland killings that were actually committed by cops. One of the cops involved did it to cover this up. It turns out some moonlighted in murder for hire while a Gang War went on. The one who'd murdered his wife tries to murder Michael while making it look like a suicide. Eugene gets shot by the other one, surviving both this and a later attempt to finish him off when he's in the hospital.

    Music 

-   "Mirrors" by Eric Bogle is about Brazilian policemen who act as freelance death squads in Rio's slums.
    
    And the killers wear policeman's badges  
    Kill to supplement their wages  
    Earn their bloody bounty, with the gun and club and knife
    
-   Warrant's "Uncle Tom's Cabin" mentions two police officers dragging bodies into the forest and dumping them down a well.
-   In "Butcher for Hire", David Rovics expresses this opinion about Real Life police chief John Timoney, who was hired by multiple different cities (and the Rebulic of Bahrain) to conduct brutal crackdowns on civil disobedience.
    
    _But someday he'll meet his end  
    He's already halfway 'round the bend  
    He'll take stock of what he's done  
    Stare at the notches on his gun  
    He'll look into the mirror and at his poor wife  
    And say, "Oh my God — I've been a scumbag my whole life"_

    Video Games 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   Case 1-5 of the first game has former detective and current high prosecutor Lana Skye accused of murder. The real killer is not just a killer cop, but killer police _chief_ Damon Gant.
    -   Not to mention killer prosecutors Manfred von Karma, Godot, Jacques Portsman, the latter of which is also involved in an international smuggling ring and killer defense attorneys Calisto Yew and Kristoph Gavin.
    -   _Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney_ has Daryan Crescend, who started out with smuggling but then killed the Interpol agent looking into him.
    -   Subverted in _Dual Destinies_ with detective Bobby Fulbright, who is not even a real detective, but an international spy impersonating the real Fulbright, who is actually long dead.
    -   In the third case of _Spirit of Justice_, it is revealed that the Kingdom of Khura'in had been employing a Secret Police and had them kill rebels with total impunity. Case 5 then tops it with Inga being a killer Minister of Justice, with Ga'ran also having killed during her tenure in the position.
    -   _The Great Ace Attorney_ tops it with a killer _judge_. Two of them, in fact. Seshiro Jigoku, the judge of the Japanese cases, killed Inspector Gregson, while Mael Stronghart, the current Lord Chief Justice of Great Britain (who serves as the judge for the final case), masterminded the Professor and Reaper murders.
-   Near the end of _Disco Elysium_, the Detective is thought to be an undercover assassin for a mob boss due to his nickname "The Human Can-Opener" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and discovering the truth behind this becomes yet another quest. At the ending Harry's partner outright states that there's no way he could ever be a mob asset due to his rampant instability.
-   It's implied in _Five Nights at Freddy's 2_ that the night guard before Jeremy (currently working the day shift) is the man responsible for the Missing Children Incident mentioned in the first game. One of the killer's Atari-esque sprites in the random after-death minigames depicts him with what appears to be a gold badge (which he also has in his Easter Egg appearance in _4_), the minigames depicting the murders are implied to have happened the week before the game, and on Night 5 Phone Guy all but states outright that the guard was arrested under suspicion. However, William Afton ended up not being charged and released due to the bodies never being found. Afton infiltrated the Freddy's location of 2 as a security guard despite his earlier falling apart with his fellow founder Henry and things rapidly escalated from there.

-   Shiver from _Sidekick Girl_. He was transferred from L.A. with a list of excessive force charges as long as his arm and has multiple "accidental" deaths in his past.

Not only would the man rape women, but he would also murder the couples he targeted. A total of 12 people were murdered by the GSK between 1980 and 1986. It took over a decade after his last rape and murder to connect the North California rapes to the South California murders. The unknown perpetrator would walk free for _42_ years before being revealed as ex-cop Joseph DeAngelo, Jr. after the FBI matched the DNA found at the crime scenes to DNA found on an open-source DNA Search website. He was finally arrested on April 25, 2018, and sentenced to life in prison on August 21, 2020.

They got away with their crimes for so long due to their membership in the police allowing them to know the patrol routes and where the police would put checkpoints after their robberies and providing them with the training to pull off their crimes, plus the one caught by a security camera unmasked being above suspicion as the brother of a cop (also in the gang), up until the investigators caught on it in late 1994, quickly identifying the one caught on camera when he inspected a potential target in person that the investigators were surveilling and tracking the entire gang from him.
