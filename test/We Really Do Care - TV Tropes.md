One character packs their bags and leaves, perhaps because they feel unappreciated, perhaps because they feel they're a burden on their friends, with nothing to contribute. The friends eventually notice and, after a round of mutual recriminations, realize that they're all to blame.

Just as the character is about to board the train, all the friends turn up, telling the character how much they are loved, and begging them to stay.

Sometimes leads to a 10-Minute Retirement.

Compare You Are Not Alone, The Power of Friendship. Not to be confused with We Care.

     Anime & Manga 

-   Kirara seems to run away in _Inuyasha_; subverted when it's revealed she was actually called away for an errand by Myoga.

-   Komusubi from _Eye Shield 21_ left the team before the Kyoshin Poseidon game, thinking that his height would be too great of a disadvantage. When this happened, the rest of the team, even including the Hah-hah Brothers and Hiruma, became worried and went to go find him. Though outwardly, Hiruma wasn't so much "worried" as "raging furious that Komusubi would give up so easily."
-   In _Fruits Basket_, Tohru briefly moves out of Shigure's house when her relatives come back to town, since that's what she'd promised to do. While they all make it clear that they don't want her around, the little Sohma outpost of Shigure, Yuki, and Kyo rediscover the fact that they fail at keeping their household running. In the end, Yuki and Kyo show up when Tohru's relatives are being especially witchy and drag her (not unwillingly) back.
-   One episode of _Sgt. Frog_ has his mother visit and embarrass her son with her antics. After Keroro snaps and tells her off, she decides to cut her visit short and return home early. Keroro realizes how badly he hurt her feelings and races to catch her at the station... and doesn't make it in time.
-   Attempted in _Berserk_, at the end of the Golden Age arc. Guts feels that being a rich mercenary in peacetime is not for him, and so packs his bags. His True Companions show up and try to convince him to stay, to no avail. Then Griffith shows up to remind Guts that he still belongs to him until he can beat him. Guts proceeds to do just that, and then he departs, leaving Griffith to his Start of Darkness.

    Comic Books 

-   In one issue of the _Fantastic Four_, Sue (feeling increasingly ignored and sidelined by her teammates) considers leaving to become an agent at Nick Fury's SHIELD agency. However, just before she's about to leave the team permanently, she sees a series of interviews with Reed, Ben and Johnny, during which the guys say they feel that Sue's the key to their success and that they'd be lost without her. This is what ultimately convinces Sue to stay with them instead of becoming a SHIELD agent.
    -   Interestingly, this particularly example differs from most others in that the guys weren't even aware of how Sue was feeling, let alone that she was thinking of actually leaving the team. So they probably meant what they said about her being the key to their success and that they'd be lost without her.

    Literature 

-   Aahz in _Myth-Nomers and Im-Pervections_, 8th book in Robert Lynn Asprin's _Myth Adventures_ series. This one does lead to a 10-Minute Retirement; Aahz is absent from nearly the entire book, while Skeeve has to go as far as Aahz's home dimension of Perv & track him down, in order to ask him to return to M.Y.T.H. Inc.
-   A variant appears in _Eight Cousins_. Rose doesn't leave, nor threaten to go anywhere (and she couldn't even if that's what she wanted), but she does let loose a volley of anger against most of her cousins when they upset the sickroom in which cousin Mac is recovering from a near-fatal illness. The fury coming from the normally sweet and placid girl leaves the boys in a state of shock, and as they come out of it, they realize that she's been the only one of them who's really been taking care of Mac, and "we haven't been half good enough to Rose." They resolve to do better going forward and demonstrate this trope to her.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Firefly_: River Tam, in "Objects in Space", announces that she is turning herself in to a bounty hunter because no one wants her around. Notable in that she never actually intended to leave; it was all part of a Batman Gambit.
-   In _Kickin' It_ Rudy is told he's obsolete to the dojo, leading to his 10-Minute Retirement. The kids eventually get him back to stop the robot that was taking over the studio.
-   Subverted in an episode of the Sitcom _Roc_, where the resident ne'er-do-well (Roc's brother) announces that he's leaving and storms out. The other characters just make bets on how long he's be gone, ranging from "back in a hour" to "never even gets out of the house". The latter proves to be the winning choice.
-   Dustin from _Stranger Things_ spends at least two seasons brooding about how he thinks he's The Friend Nobody Likes. Since he came to Hawkins in second grade, while the other Party members had already known each other for years at that point, he reasons that they're all closer to each other than to him. However, by the end of season 3, they reunite and they tell him he's a valuable member to the Party.
-   _Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye_: Lucy, the group's rotor, rethinks her professional life after a sick day in which everyone dumps a bunch of work on her and fails to appreciate what she usually does to keep the office running. They realize that they made a mistake when Lucy is replaced by a much less competent temp and Sue explains the situation. At the end, Sue sends Levi into Lucy's new office with a note asking her to come out to the hall. It's the others, who present her with a number of gift baskets and a plea to return.
-   In an episode of _The Basil Brush Show_, Basil leaves the flat after his friends turn their back on him for his seemingly nasty attitude towards his cousin, Mortimer. However, after it turns out that Mortimer is secretly evil (which Basil had been trying to tell his friends that entire time), the rest of the cast run to the train station to stop Basil, who is about to board a train to nowhere.

    Radio 

-   The plot of the episode "Friendship" in _Our Miss Brooks_.

    Western Animation 

-   Subverted in one episode of _Beetlejuice_, when the title character thinks everyone prefers his brother Donny over him and ultimately leaves for the (literal) Despair Event Horizon. The problem is that, with the exception of his Morality Chain Lydia, he's right - everyone _does_ like Donny better than him, and no one, except Donny himself, will help her try to find BJ and bring him home.

    Real Life 

-   Ringo left The Beatles on an extended holiday after deciding that the band didn't need him. His bandmates weren't long in flying over to ask him to come back and George Harrison even decorated his drum set with flowers as a welcome-back surprise.
-   James LaBrie of Dream Theater wrecked his vocal cords after getting severe food poisoning-induced vomiting, which led to a space of about two and a half years to _fully_ recover. During that time he went through bouts of depression and seriously contemplated leaving the band, but the rest of his bandmates convinced him otherwise.
