_A scorpion this big you won't find curled up in your boot. Maybe_ around _your boot, but not_ in _it._

In Real Life, scorpions are mostly shy, retiring arachnids, preferring to stay out of trouble and only using their pincers and stinging tails to subdue prey (or potential mates) or defend themselves.

In fictionland, scorpions often make appearances as deadly foes. This is probably a combination of Rule of Cool and their distinctively badass appearance, but it does tend to get them a fair bit of demonization due to Animal Stereotypes. Scorpions, being of the arachnid class, are closely related to spiders, and as with spiders and their fangs, scorpions are pretty much universally known for their tails, and are, admittedly, pretty scary things to come across, large or small.

In popular culture, scorpions are often depicted as scary even by arachnid standards. While there are a number of examples of heroic or at least benign spiders in fiction, scorpions are almost invariably portrayed as evil to the point of being made out as an Unpleasant Animal Counterpart to spiders. For a given value of evil that is, as they rarely have developed enough personalities to amount to anything more than dangerous, mindless animals and often no more than tools of murder for wannabe killers: because of their venom, they are used as Animal Assassins, although where Spiders might be associated with the thief or rogue in a Fantasy setting, Scorpions tend to be associated with hunters or warriors due to their heavy armor. You can often expect scorpions in Shifting Sand Land, possibly alongside Scorpion People. Spider Tanks may have the appearance of a scorpion. May be stabbed.

However, the majority of scorpion stings are not dangerous to humans, being on average only about as dangerous as a bee sting. The Emperor Scorpion, probably the largest and most iconic scorpion species, is frequently seen, despite being one of the least venomous species and are even popular as pets or even as food (popular as far as arachnid fans go, anyway).

Compare Spiders Are Scary and Creepy Camel Spider, for other arachnids that tend to be portrayed as much more dangerous and aggressive than they are in real life. Also see here for how real-life scorpions are different from many fictional ones.

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai_: the debut of Leona has her attacked out of the blue by a titanic scorpion monster who's much bigger and more menacing than any other monster dwelling on the island: the beast poisons the princess and takes a well-aimed strike to the back of its shell to be defeated. Turns out, Bishop Temujin and his associate brought the monster to the island specifically to get rid of Leona.
-   The Tachikomas of _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ are what happens when you get a Spider Tank to follow Rule of Cute, but a much more menacing scorpion-shaped Super Prototype appears in one episode.
-   The first _Inuyasha_ movie starts with the heroes confronting a giant Scorpion youkai with a secondary head in its stinger, which Miroku correctly identifies as an animal not native to Japan, which later reveals that the Big Bad actually hails from China.
-   _Kekkaishi_: The Ayakashi species of Sasorigama have the body like a big brown spider with sickle-like limbs. They also smell so horrible that Madarao and Hakubi cannot take it.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_: The Scorpio is one of the largest and most powerful mobile suits in its universe. Naturally, its alternate form resembles a giant red scorpion (though like the ReGZ, it starts off in its flight form and must jettison parts to transform).
-   Sasori the puppetmaster from _Naruto_. Granted, only his "outer form" looks vaguely like one (complete with bladed tail.) He also puts a red scorpion logo on the puppets he makes.
-   The Puzzle Scorpions in Impel Down in _One Piece_. They can "merge" together and form a giant centipede.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_ has a subversion in Ash Ketchum's Gligar (later Gliscor) during the Sinnoh arc. Not that Gligar generally look too menacing to begin with, but this one has such a tendency towards Tender Tears and The Glomp with its trainer that it's borderline impossible to be the slightest bit intimidated, even when it evolves into its more threatening-_looking_ final form. On the other hand, Ash's Rival during the same arc, Paul, has a Gliscor who is more threatening, and a Drapion who can be downright terrifying. The trope is played even _straighter_ with the Drapion who is owned by Pokémon Hunter J, which is just as ruthless and sociopathic as its trainer.
-   Shaula Gorgon the Big Bad of _Soul Eater Not!_ is a clear example. Though she's also the youngest and not nearly as dangerous nor underhanded as her elder sisters in comparison.
-   In _Tegami Bachi: Letter Bee_, which has Gaichuu resemble giant armored insects and arachnids, Laphroiag, a plot-important Gaichuu that was responsible for Zazie's parents' deaths, looks like a scorpion.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: Adiane, the scorpion-tailed Ms. Fanservice Supreme General of the Spiral King She wears an Eyepatch of Power over her left eye and is intensely hot and impulsive, often letting her anger get the better of her and land her in sticky situations or taking out her frustrations on Viral.
-   MegaZarak of _Transformers: ★Headmasters_, like his Western Animation counterpart Scorponok, is a city-sized Transformer that becomes a Kaiju-sized scorpion (as well as a city/base mode). He gets an upgrade into Black Zarak in _Transformers: Super-God Masterforce_, which is a nearly-identical but recolored body with a new head.
-   _Zoids: Chaotic Century_: The Death Stinger is a hyper-aggressive scorpion-type Zoid with a Wave-Motion Gun for a stinger.

    Card Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Unlike most "regular" animals, which tend to be Green (the color of the natural world), scorpions are almost exclusively Black (the color of rot, decay and amorality). They usually get deathtouch (meaning they destroy any creature they deal any damage to) or some way to weaken enemy creatures or players by means such as poison counters.

    Comic Books 

-   In _The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones_ #13, one of Indy's students on a field trip is paralyzed with fear by a scorpion on her arm. Dr. Jones picks the arachnid off her arm with his bullwhip.
-   Subverted by Sammy Stingtail of the _Joey Fly_ series. While reckless and clumsy, he is also unarguably one of the good guys and loyal to the title Detective Animal.
-   _Spider-Man_: Mac Gargan/The Scorpion from Marvel Comics, of course. He was created — with funding from J Jonah Jameson, no less — to take out Spider-Man, and actually trounced Spidey in their first fight. He's been mostly B-list since then, however, eventually ditching the Scorpion suit entirely to become the new Venom, but then when the symbiote was given to Flash Thompson, he took up his old identity again. He had a female sort-of-Legacy Character, Carmilla Black, but she's been rarely seen since he retook the Scorpion mantle.
-   In _Star Wars (Marvel 1977)_, in order to get information out of someone, Luke Skywalker once has to prove his bravery by using chopsticks in his left hand to fish something out of the same bowl as an alien scorpion creature. Though to be fair, the alien creature could be far more venomous than the normal Earthling variety.
-   _The Transformers (Marvel)_ and _The Transformers (IDW)_ depict Scorponok much smaller than his city-sized animated counterparts, though he still transformers into a giant, gun-laden mechanical scorpion, and his robot mode still towers over most Transformers.

    Fan Works 

-   _Adopted Displaced_: The main villain in "Dressed To Steal" is a malicious anthropomorphic scorpion called Seft, who bears an enmity towards Sly Cooper.
-   _The Palaververse_: Gigantic wind scorpions are one of the many species of monster native to Saddle Arabia, and have the added bonus of being able to turn into wind to elude both prey and pursuit.
-   _Prehistoric Earth_: While not portrayed as explicitly evil or any more aggressive than any modern animal, both the pulmonoscorpius and multiple species of 'sea scorpion' come the closest to coming across as monstrous by virtue of just how sinister their descriptions in the narrative make them sound.
-   _Prehistoric Park Reimagined_: Pulmonoscorpius are amongst the animals rescued for the titular park. And while not evil or any more aggressive than any modern scorpion, they _are_ noticeably played for suspense in their introductory scene and noticeably prove a source of great trepidation for Leon (who admittedly does at that point feel generally unnerved around many invertebrates).
-   _Sunshine and Fire_: Soon after arriving in Sunshine!Equestria, Twilight is attacked by a group of _enormous_ scorpions. She assumes them to be Mutants, as, besides their size, they only have two eyes each instead of eight and more legs than they should, including atrophied ones and ones extending from their sides at useless angles.

    Films — Animated 

-   _An American Tail: Fievel Goes West_: Fievel is almost killed by a scorpion. Considering he's a mouse it's not that surprising.
-   _DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp_: The bottom of the chamber where Collie Baba's treasure is kept has quite a few big ones, which Launchpad dubs "Sumo wrestling scorpions." Scrooge dismisses them as they're at the bottom of _very_ deep pit, but then Evil Sorcerer Merlock pulls a lever that causes the platform where the treasure is to lower...
-   _The Emperor's New Groove_: Kuzco and Pacha were briefly attacked by several scorpions while trying to climb a cliff.
-   _The Nightmare Before Christmas_: While planning (and singing about) the capture of Santa Claus, Shock has a box of large scorpions that she uses to illustrate her plan for herself and her brothers to hide in a box that Santa would open so they could kidnap him.
-   _Pinocchio in Outer Space_. While exploring below the surface of Mars, Pinocchio and Nurtle are chased by a gigantic scorpion.

-   _The Black Scorpion_ involves a volcanic eruption in Mexico unleashing gigantic scorpions upon the land.
-   _The Cave_: Jack encounters a cavern full of them, upon which they try to chase him off.
-   _Clash of the Titans (1981)_: Medusa's blood causes normal scorpions to become giants. In _Clash of the Titans (2010)_, there are still massive killer scorpions but it's caused by the blood of Calibos, who has been given godly powers by Hades. The scorpions seem to be better at the job than Calibos was. The scorpions kill two Argosian soldiers (as opposed to Calibos's four), but they tend to make more of an impression, being, you know, giant scorpions. They also make good mounts, once they are tamed.

-   _Honey, I Shrunk the Kids_: At one point, the kids are attacked by a scorpion after taking shelter in a LEGO brick. Anty, an ant they befriended earlier that day, tries to save them and succeeds, though at the cost of its life, buying the kids enough time to get their act together and drive the beast off with their torches and sharpened sticks. Of course in this case, since scorpions _are_ predators, a scorpion really would be scary and dangerous if you'd been shrunk down to the size of an insect.
-   _Hook_: The eponymous pirate locks a pirate who bet against him in a large trunk called "The Boo Box." Apparently it is a common and deathly frightening punishment for pirates on the Jolly Roger, because the man Screams Like a Little Girl, is thrown into the trunk, and has a bunch of scary scorpions dropped on him while the others scream "Boo!"
-   _If Looks Could Kill_: A scorpion is utilized as an Animal Assassin. It's really a harmless emperor scorpion, though.

    Gamebooks 

-   _Fighting Fantasy_: Giant scorpions are a recurring threat, showing up in _Scorpion Swamp_ (naturally), _Magehunter_, _Curse of the Mummy_, _Bloodbones_ and the largest of the lot, from _Deathtrap Dungeon_. The latter from _Dungeon_ has two attacks simultaneously (given it has a Skill of 10, it can inflict double the damage on players with ease) and a stinger tail that inflicts a One-Hit Kill by rolling a double-twelve. Luckily that scorpion is a Skippable Boss, where players can battle the much easier Minotaur instead.

    Literature

Eventually, Gabool, having lost his sanity throughout the book, starts siccing Skrabblag on any rat he deems a mutineer or a spy. Skrabblag nearly takes out a Badger Lord before his would-be victim flings him into the face of Gabool, and the scorpion wastes no time in stinging him to death. Dandin finishes off Skrabblag mere moments later, commenting that "evil destroyed evil, and good triumphed."

So the frog relents and lets the scorpion hop on board. Midway across the river, the frog feels a sharp pain in his back and realizes the scorpion's stung him.

Villagers will panic on seeing them and will sweat nervously until either the scorpion is caught or it despawns.
-   _ARK: Survival Evolved_: _Pulmonoscorpius_ is a scorpion the size of a pony. It is a highly aggressive predator with a paralyzing venom, which makes it the bane of every starting player. Fortunately, you are also able to tame this creature and, with the right saddle, even ride it, making it a valuable ally.
-   _Battle for Wesnoth_: giant blue scorpions are commonly used as neutral critters, unavailable for hire. They can be pretty dangerous in combat, attacking with either several strikes of their pincers or a single, venomous stinger strike, but lack any form of ranged combat. During the campaign "Son of Black Eye", the Troll in the party tries to cook and eat a desert scorpion, only to find out they taste like crap.
-   _Breathless_ has robotic scorpions as uncommon, occasional enemies you can fight.
-   _Bug_ had _loads_ of them in the desert stage. Some just walked back and forth, others tried to attack with extendable claws, and a few tried to sting bug with their tail. Thankfully, they all took one hit to die, making them not too big of a threat.
-   _Bug Fables_: Psicorps are common enemies in the Lost Sands, though they are actually pseudoscorpions. Actual scorpions also make an appearance, as the Dune Scorpion appears as a Mini-Boss, also in the Lost Sands. Not only it's a vicious, violent predator, but it manages to nearly kill Leif just when the team presumed it to be dead. In the Giant's Lair, the Roaches who live there also managed to tame scorpions as pets, even noting they are very tame when compared to the Dead Landers, much to the heroes' disturbance.
-   _Cave In_: Scorpions are a type of enemy you can face in the game. Like all enemies, they are dealt with by being shot.

-   The Brotherhood of Nod in the _Command & Conquer: Tiberian Series_ follows this psychology and uses a scorpion tail as its emblem, staying hidden when they are incapable of waging war with the GDI and striking at them when their prey is vulnerable.
-   In _Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped_, scorpions appear as enemies in the Arabian town levels (Hang Em' High, Hang Time, Flaming Passion) crawling upside down on the overhead grates the player has to climb through.
-   _Dark Souls II_ has Scorpioness Nakja, an Expy of Quelaag from the first game. Nakja has the upper body of a woman, but it's attached at the waist to the head of a giant, two-tailed scorpion. There is also Manscorpion Tark, a similar blend of man and scorpion, but despite his intimidating appearance, he's completely friendly and you can hold a conversation with him. In fact, it's even possible to summon him to help you against Nakja (he's her ex-husband, and he considers her to have gone insane and wishes to prevent her from harming anyone else).
-   The scorpion in _Deadly Creatures_ is one of two playable arachnids, the other being a spider... thing is, this particular scorpion appears to be channeling Kratos, as it has some unusually complex and brutal kill moves for what is supposed to be a wild animal.
-   _Demon Skin_ has giant scorpions as enemies in the forest and caverns, whose stingers can inflict a poisoned status on you if you're hit by it's projectiles. There are even bright orange King Mook scorpions every now and then.
-   _Diablo III_ has Tormented Stingers, which look and sting like scorpions but are actually tortured human sacrifices with their body sliced open to form the legs and its legs mutilated to make the tail.
-   _Dogyuun_ has many scorpion mechas in stage 4. The boss of that stage is a giant robot scorpion that shoots homing balls from its tail, and tries to massacre you with its claws.
-   _Dominions_: Scorpions are part of the unit list of Xibalba, tames by their ultrasonic voices. The oldest and largest of them are considered sacred.
-   Crixalis, the Sand King, from _Dota 2_, was meant to be an Anthropomorphic Personification of the desert, but he took the form of a scorpion because scorpions are found in the desert commonly and his old model was a scorpion-ish Nerubian from _Warcraft III_. He's more about burrowing, but his stinger tail contains venom that will make those infected by it explode messily when they die as shown in his skill Caustic Finale. It's the least of your worries when it comes to Sand King.
-   _Dragon's Crown_ has cat-sized Scorpions as a common enemy encounter. They're small enough that several attacks whiff over them, but their poison still packs a punch. In fact, the art book mentions that Elves harvest their poison for their poisoned arrows and daggers. They're also large enough to be common source of nutrition for adventurers and are cooked like crabs during camp.
-   The Big Bad in _Drone Tactics_ operates a giant mechanical scorpion.
-   Giant Desert Scorpions from _Dwarf Fortress_, who in addition to being very, very large and lethally venomous<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  have _prehensile claws_ and a penchant for snatching weapons off attackers and using them in addition to their claws and sting.
-   _EarthBound (1994)_ has a creature called a Skelpion that appears in the Dusty Dunes Desert, which is basically a scorpion skeleton, which is weird because scorpions are invertebrates. Stronger versions called Dread Skelpions appear later in the deserts of Scaraba.
-   _EarthBound Beginnings_ has your regular scorpions, as well as the more dangerous Bionic Scorps.
-   Averted or inverted in _Eastern Exorcist_, a game where most of the demons are animal-human hybrids. There's only one scorpion character, and he's a _doctor_. Who tries to _cure_ your brother after he was poisoned by a snake-demon.
-   _Eternal Evil_ has a mutant scorpion monster stalking you for most of the game's first half, before you face it as a boss where it's roughly as large as the room you fight it in. You could collect notes regarding the scorpion's origins - supposedly, it's a rare animal breed from China who grows in size through contact with _human_ blood.
-   _Eternity: The Last Unicorn_ have gigantic scorpions as enemies around the Reno Lake ruins. Beware the stingers!
-   _Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth_: There's a species of FOE in the second stratum (Jagged Reach) called Glaring Stinger, which is modeled like a purple-colored scorpions with golden stinging tails. However, their front limbs are shaped like crustacean pincers instead of arachnid ones.
-   _Evil Genome_ is set after an apocalypse turns the earth into a desert-covered wasteland, whose surface is filled with gigantic scorpions. They're the first monsters that attacks you the moment you stepped off your crashed ship.
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Giant Fist_: Scorpions populate the desert stage surrounding Blackberry's pyramid and within it, one of which is the size of a tank.
-   _Fable_ had Arachanox, the huge scorpion that serves as the final boss of the Arena. Unless you consider Whisper.
-   _Fallout_: Gigantic, radiation-mutated scorpions are a mainstay of the games.
    -   In the first two games, they essentially make for an early game nuisance/slight challenge. In the third game as well as _New Vegas_, the regular variety is still a nuisance, though the giant ones may serve as a legitimate threat, having no head to target for additional damage and being faster then the player, hardly slowed down at all by crippled legs. Then the _Broken Steel_ DLC gave us the albino radscorpion, every bit as big and fast as a regular giant radscorpion, but harder to see from a distance, having a much higher damage potential, and being durable enough to take a nuke on the chin and keep on going as if nothing happened (and this is not an exaggeration), regenerating all the while, being one of the DLC's three bosses in mook's clothing.
    -   _Fallout: New Vegas_:
        -   There's a radscorpion queen who is extraordinarily difficult. Tough, fast, lots of damage, and fought in extremely close quarters so that escaping damage is impossible. You fight her along with a couple of her kids, too, just for extra hurt.
        -   The _Old World Blues_ DLC has Dr. Mobius' Robo-Scorpions that can shoot Frickin' Laser Beams, with a Giant version as a boss. And by Giant, we mean Giant.
    -   _Fallout 4_ radscorpions are not your old radscorpions. _These_ radscorpions have no small variants, and the weakest of them is at LEAST the size of a bear, and armored to boot. They can also now burrow and pop up right in melee range. And then you get a horrifying close-up of their high-def character models as they sting you in the face for a huge amount of poison damage.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   _Final Fantasy X_ has Sinspawn Gui and its Palette Swap Ultima Buster, which bear distinct resemblances to scorpions. They both have multiple pairs of legs, large arms positioned like a scorpion's pincers, and a long "tail" that arches over their back like a scorpion's tail. However, this "tail" doesn't end in a stinger, it ends in a second head. This second head can poison your characters, likely referencing the scorpion's sting.
    -   _Final Fantasy XV_ has the reapertails, reaperkings and saphyrtails. Their attacks can ignore the player's Vitality stat.
    -   _Final Fantasy Mystic Quest_ features scorpions as a tough early-game enemy. They don't first appear in the Shifting Sand Land, but in Slippy-Slidey Ice World.
-   _Frogger's Journey: The Forgotten Relic_: Scorpions appear as enemies patrolling the Pyramid. They move in particularly difficult patterns in the rooms Frogger can fall into.
-   A mechanical version exists in _Funk Unplugged_. They're robotic hats that move around on spider-like legs, and fire lasers from a blaster on a tail on their backside.
-   _Geneforge_ has giant scorpion monsters called clawbugs which are available to the player as Mons and commonly show up as early mid-game enemies, usually inhabiting areas of desert and blasted wasteland. Since the premise of the series includes mage-scientists tinkering with life forms, they show up in several varieties; normal clawbugs, venomous stinging clawbugs, extra-fast plated bugs, and Boss in Mook Clothing clawbug queens.
-   Kratos fights a giant one of these in _God of War III_. He also fights several who are merely large before and during the aforementioned fight.
-   _Golden Sun_ has the King Scorpion boss and giant scorpions later on.
-   _Gryphon Knight Epic_: Zafira Faris, one of the bosses, rides a gigantic scorpion.
-   _Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures_ has giant, Scary Scorpions alongside giant spiders as the weakest enemies in the game. They are found in both the Amazon jungle and the caverns beneath.
-   _Hero of Sparta_ have massive scorpions as recurring enemies, from puppy-sized (which dies in one hit) to Giant Mook (which soaks up plenty of blows, with a stinger tail large enough to skewer you before shaking you like a maraca before throwing you aside).
-   _Intrepid Izzy_: Scorpions serve as an enemy in the game. They'll sting Izzy if she gets too close.
-   _King's Quest_:
    -   Graham encounters a scorpion in _King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!_. Despite being significantly smaller than the one Valanice comes across, it's also far more deadly, resulting in an instant death as soon as you reach the screen it shows up on (whereas Valanice's giant scorpion rather courteously gives you some time to deal with it before attacking).
    -   In _King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride_, Valanice is attacked by a giant scorpion.
-   In _Kolibri_, the scorpions are normal-sized, but the player character is a normal-sized hummingbird, so they're proportionately gigantic, _and_ they've been given projectiles and sent berserk by a corrupting alien crystal. That said, they aren't very mobile, acting more as level hazards than true enemies.
-   _The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning_: Buffalo beetles are, name notwithstanding, scorpions much larger than Spyro found in the Munitions Forge, who attack with their claws and with fiery beams shot from their stingers.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   _Zelda II: The Adventure of Link_: Arurodas are blue-colored scorpions with cyclopean eyes that shoot fireballs at Link from their tails. The eye is the weak point, but Link has to wait until it opens to hit it, or else his sword attacks will ricochet. These enemies are found exclusively on East Hyrule, specifically the southeast region of the map housing the last two towns (both named Kasuto), as well as the last two dungeons, in the game.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_: Moldarach is a positively humongous scorpion that dwells in the sands of the Lanayru Mining Facility's rotunda. Its most notable features are the eyes that are within its pincers. Another is fought as a Degraded Boss in the Lanayru Shipyard later in the game.
-   _League of Legends_: Skarner takes form of a scorpion, and his pincers really pack a punch. He's not a venomous scorpion, but his stinger tail can inflict another breed of 'poison', in this case, encase his victim in crystal for a few seconds and he can drag them anywhere he moves.
-   _Little Red Hood_: Scorpions appear as enemies.
-   _Looney Tunes_ games:
    -   In _Road Runner's Death Valley Rally_, scorpions serve as enemies in the first world, "Zippity Splat".
    -   In _Desert Speedtrap Starring Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote_, Scorpions serve as common enemies. They attack Road Runner by shooting venom from their tails.
    -   In _Cheese Cat-Astrophe Starring Speedy Gonzales_, scorpions serve as enemies in World 1, the Desert. They attack Speedy by stinging him with their tails.
-   In _The Lucky Dime Caper Starring Donald Duck_, the pyramid level is filled with scorpions. They're quite fast and drop by the dozens from baskets hanging from the ceiling.
-   _Mega Man X_: Mega Scorpio from _Mega Man X7_ and Mega Scorpia from _Mega Man Zero 2_. Downplayed- although they are large and imposing, they are only Warm Up Bosses.
-   _Mega Man X: Corrupted_, a fan-made game, uses a scorpion called Sparkling Scorpio as a proper Maverick Boss.
-   _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_ has an Emperor Scorpion as an edible animal during the mountainside section of the game, though it provides little stamina and in any case Snake hates the flavour. Sadly, they're also depicted as being capable of killing Snake when they sting him, despite the fact that Emperor Scorpion venom isn't fatal to humans. That said, this makes them a pretty decent (if lethal — remember the Pacifist Run option) Improvised Weapon if you capture one alive and throw it at an enemy.
-   _Miitopia_: The Neksdor Desert is populated with big scorpion enemies, one of them sharing its name with this very trope.
-   _Mo' Creatures_: This _Minecraft_ mod includes scorpions as a tamable neutral mob. They’re huge, about the size of the player, and come in four variants, with will deliver different status effects if they sting you: common dirt scorpions will poison you, cave scorpions will give you nausea, ice scorpions will slow you down, and Nether scorpions will set you on fire. You can also turn them into undead scorpions with an essence of undead.
-   _Monster Eye_ have giant insects as a recurring enemy, including scorpions in multiple levels. The Chinatown stage ends with a _kaiju_ scorpion boss fight that you can only defeat by blasting it's pincers and tails to a stump.
-   _Mortal Kombat_: Surprisingly, even if he's named after the creature, Scorpion isn't really heavily based on the trope, although his signature kunai on a rope can be considered as his equivalent of the namesake's stinger tail in form and works like a scorpion's pincer claws (holding his victims in the most preferred place). However, he CAN turn into a literal giant scorpion for a Fatality.
-   _Musashi Samurai Legend_: the second boss is Gorpus, a giant monster who was sealed by the Earth Maiden Burrini inside a gigantic stone urn, using the Sword of Earth as a linchpin to keep the monster asleep. Gorpus resembles a gigantic purple scorpion with a mechanical cannon for a stinger and a helmet-like head which must be cut apart to reveal its real weakness: a giant orange eyeball.
-   One of the cyborg enemies in _NanoBreaker_ is a mechanical scorpion capable of blasting energy bolts from it's tail.
-   _No More Heroes_:
    -   The first game has a minigame where Travis has to scoop up scorpions while avoiding stings. Their speed and agility will be determined by their color, with the blue ones being the hardest (but also the most valuable score-wise). It's recommended to only play this minigame if you've unlocked the sprint skill.
    -   _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_ brings back the scorpion hunt minigame from the first game; scorpions are also enemies in some of the 8-bit retro minigames, serving as mooks.
    -   _No More Heroes III_: There's an overworld-wide Collection Sidequest where Travis has to capture scorpions and take them to a sushi kiosk close to his motel room. These scorpions are _dangerous_, because a sting will cause Travis to faint and respawn in his motel, very far from the place where he found the scorpion (and said scorpion will also change its location, so geting back to where Travis first found it will be a waste of time).
-   _Nuclear Throne_ has scorpions in the starting area, the Desert. They have a decent amount of health and shoot acid, and will stab you with their stingers if you touch them. There are also golden scorpions, which have more health and shoot more acid — at two different speeds! And they shoot out even _more_ acid when they die.
-   _Parasite Eve_: The Museum of Natural History features a particularly large, tough scorpion enemy with a stretchable tail that can reach almost across the room.
-   The true form of the final boss of _P.N.03_ is a giant mecha-scorpion, although it rarely uses its "stinger".
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Gligar and Gliscor cross this trope with Bat Out of Hell. Gligar, at least, has a tendency to fly straight at its targets' faces and clamping on tight before injecting them full of poison.
    -   Skorupi is a fairly straight example, ambushing prey while hiding below the sand with its poison sting at the ready, but its evolution Drapion is an interesting subversion. It's stated to have a very bad reputation due to its aggressive nature, but according to some of its Pokedex entries it actively avoids using poison in combat, preferring to fight with its claws and great physical strength. Which, incidentally, is how larger scorpion species tend to hunt in real life.
    -   Kincaid, The Dragon of the local villain team in _Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia_, uses the Gligar and Scorupi lines exclusively, even both at the same time in one downloadable mission.
-   _Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones_: when the Vizier stabs himself with the Dagger of Time, a body horrorific transformation takes place and he seenmingly grows scorpion parts through his body. His Zurvan form resembles an impossibly bright floating humanoid with carapace-covered legs and tails like a scorpion.
-   _Putrefaction_ has huge scorpion monsters in the sequel's Putrid World, capable of spitting acid streams from a distance. Get too close and they'll swing their stinging barbs instead.
-   Giant Scorpions exist in _Puzzle Quest_, where their major abilities are (a) hiding (letting them do double damage until you damage them _out_ of hiding) and (b) poisoning you. However, once you've clocked three of them, you can _capture and tame_ one to act as your _steed_ (no access to the poison, but you _do_ get their Hide ability).
-   Gigantic black scorpions are also a common foe is the desert setting of _Quest for Glory II_, and have a powerful venom that makes them one of the more dangerous foes in the game.
-   _Quest for the Shaven Yak: Starring Ren Hoëk & Stimpy_: In The Stinking Dry Desert, there are scorpion enemies that act as mirages of glasses of lemonade.
-   In the original _Rayman_, one of the bosses is Mr. Skops, a giant red scorpion who can throw his claws at you and fire lasers from the stinger on his tail.
-   The Stinger, the Giant Space Flea from Nowhere boss from _Resident Evil 0_ and _Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles_ who smashes through the roof of the train to cause some trouble. Despite its intimidating size, it goes down effortlessly if you feed a few rounds from the Hunting Gun into its face from point-blank range. Apparently they were carrying it on the train to study it, but it got free when the Leech Zombies appeared.
-   There are a large variety of scorpions in _RuneScape_.
-   _Serious Sam 3_ has an anti-piracy feature that presents the unlicensed player with a red scorpion centaur that has limitless hit points. It can follow the player anywhere he can go, and always homes in on him anywhere on the playfield. Specialized threads on game forums are dedicated to queries on "How do I kill Red Scorpion?" The answer is always the same: "Buy a legit copy of the game, cheapskate!"
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_:
    -   _Sonic CD_ has Sasori, a robotic scorpion that inhabits Quartz Quadrant Zone and attacks by shooting lasers from its tail.
    -   In _Sonic Spinball_, the boss of the first level, Toxic Caves, is Scorpius, a giant robotic scorpion with Robotnik's face and a tail that sprays poisonous goop to attack with.
    -   _Sonic and Knuckles_ has Skorp, a robotic scorpion that inhabits Sandopolis Zone.
    -   _Sonic 3D Blast_ has Scorpy, a robotic scorpion that inhabits Volcano Valley Zone.
    -   A non-robotic example in _Sonic Adventure_; Chaos 6 takes on the form of a bloated scorpion who stings Sonic, Knuckles, and Big with his tail.
    -   _Sonic Chronicles_: Another non-robotic example. One of the missions to collect the devices in Chapter 3 has the player save a young boy from two giant scorpions. They have poison attacks, cannot be fleed from, and are generally tough opponents for how early they appear in game.
-   The third boss of _Space Debris_ is a giant alien scorpion the size of a building, whose tail can spam energy blasts on the player.
-   _Space Quest 3_: "OH NO! A venomous scorpazoid. Watch out."
-   A puzzle in episode 5 of _Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People_ involves getting a chunk of scorpion food away from a horde of 8-bit scorpions.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   In _Donkey Kong '94_, Mario encounters indestructible scorpion enemies called Scorpy in the desert stage, which will cause him to lose a life should he touch them.
    -   Mario's doppelganger Wario has faced scorpion enemies on occasion, typically found in desert areas.
        -   _Wario Land: Shake It!_ features Flipstings, who keep their stingers arched over their backs and are thus immune to jump attacks.
        -   _Wario World_ has Big Scorpers, which attack by lashing with their stingers.
-   _The Wind Road_ has giant scorpion enemies in the caverns, who ambushes you by tunneling from underground.

-   _Tales of Symphonia_ had a desert that featured these.
-   The second act of _Titan Quest_, set in Egypt, is full of large scorpions (black ones as large as a men and yellow ones big as grown elephants.) as well as the Scorpos, a hybrid of man and scorpion. Their king is the boss that protects one of the artifacts necessary to continue the story.
-   _Terraria_ has giant Sand Poachers that appear in the Underground Desert during Hardmode, which are capable of climbing walls at very fast speeds and are capable of inflicting the Acid Venom debuff whenever they hit the player. Regular non-giant scorpions appear as well, but they're a subversion since they just wander around and are completely incapable of harming the player.
-   In _ULTRAKILL_, the Hideous Mass is a Greater Demon that can be best described as a grotesque, scorpion-shaped amalgamation of meat and statues. According to its Terminal Data, these rare demons are the result of a single shell filled with an excessive amount of Hell mass, causing the mass to burst open the shell and flow through the seams. It's also a formidable foe, thanks to its massive health, damage-proof stone carapace, the ability to fire rains of Hell energy, and the ability to fire its stinger tail like a harpoon. Thankfully, it only stays in one spot, and attacking its weak spots (such as the underbelly and tail) deals extra damage.
-   In _Unemployment Quest_, you play as a young man named Chris who's trying to get a job, and fights monsters that take the form of his negative emotions. The one representing Laziness looks like a scorpion.

There are also regular sized scorpions as critters in some areas, and one scorpion non-combat pet, and now a scorpion _mount_. The arachnathids have inexplicably disappeared.
    -   Fire scorpions appear in the Firelands, and Druids of the Flame can transform into them.
    -   The Iron Juggernaut in the Siege of Orgrimmar resembles a scorpion. Its claws have a drill and buzzsaw on them, and there is a laser mounted on its tail.
    -   Skorpyron, the first boss of the Nighthold, is a massive arcane scorpion with magical powers.
-   The Endegras from _The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings_ are a mix of this trope and Giant Spider; they all have pincers but only Warriro Endegras also have stingers.

    Web Animation 

-   _RWBY_:
    -   The Deathstalker, an armored scorpion the size of _several_ vans. The first one we see takes the combined efforts of four main characters to bring it down.
        -   _RWBY: Amity Arena_ makes for a different kind of "Scary": the Baby Deathstalker is much smaller than the one in the show, but it's a whole swarm with really quick attack, and thus can destroy what's on their path in the blink of an eye.
    -   Tyrian Callows, a Scorpion Faunus with a poisonous stinger that serves as Salem's primary enforcer and assassin. A Serial Killer that terrorized multiple kingdoms, he worships Salem as a literal goddess and takes great pleasure in serving her in whatever way she desires. Even the other members of Salem's group consider him disturbing, with Tyrian just as eager to torment his "allies" as his enemies when given the opportunity. Insane and melodramatic as he is, Tyrian is far more cunning and intelligent than he seems — able to manipulate his victims and psychologically torment them before ending their lives. Inspired by the fable, _"The Scorpion and the Frog"_, Tyrian is a sadist capable of turning the tables on the unwary, even when seemingly captured and helpless.

    Webcomics 

    Western Animation

-   In one episode of _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_, Grim and Dracula find themselves stranded in the desert and are attacked by scorpions, which they end up eating. It's shortly revealed that the scorpions were babies belonging to a horrified giant mother scorpion, who attacked them in retaliation.
    
    **Giant Scorpion:** My babies!''  
    **Dracula:** Well, maybe if you didn't make your babies so delicious, Dracula wouldn't have had to eat 'em!
    
-   In the _Hercules_/_Aladdin_ crossover "Hercules and the Arabian Night", Jafar conjures up a giant scorpion to take on Hercules. Jafar says it is the perfect counter to Hercules, because of its incredible speed. Fortunately, Hercules anticipated this and he and Aladdin had disguised themselves as each other. Aladdin easily evades the scorpion's attacks with his agility, then he and Hercules destroy Jafar's staff of power, making the scorpion disappear.
-   _Jonny Quest_ TOS episode "The Curse of Anubis". A desert scorpion menaces the Quest team, but Race Bannon kills it with a whip.
-   Averted and then played straight in the Sniz & Fondue cartoon "A Toxic Tail" on _KaBlam!_. Fondue buys a Madagascar Scorpion to keep Sniz out of his room.

-   A giant scorpion (actually a robot) shows up in an Ancient Egypt episode of _Scooby-Doo_.
-   Scorpia from _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_ is a subversion: she's a big, muscular scorpion-woman with pincers and a stinger tail, working for the evil Horde, but she has such a nice, affable personality that she barely qualifies as a villain. (She even defects to the side of good!) She can still put up a fight, though. Played straight when Scorpia is chipped by Horde Prime—turns out that with her free will and personality being overridden by a narcissistic maniac, her strength and lightning powers make her actually kind of scary. It's still downplayed, though—she doesn't speak or change facial expressions while chipped (unlike Micah and Spinnerella, who seem to display much more sadism and/or creepiness when under Prime's control), and she manages to subtly resist Prime's control more often than other chip victims.
-   _Teen Titans_ introduces Terra by having her running from/fighting a giant scorpion.
-   _Xiaolin Showdown_:
    -   One episode was actually about Kimiko accidentally setting an evil scorpion demon named Sibini free after accidentally smashing a Shen Gon Wu called the "Mosaic Scale" (also Sibini's supposed prison) to pieces, and as a result, she and her partners had to put it back together again before Sibini wreaked havoc upon the entire world.
    -   Another episode featured a Shen Gon Wu called the "Emperor Scorpion", which actually served as some sort of mind-control device.

-   A discovery in 2020 determined that some of the first animals to venture from water onto land were probably primordial scorpions, evolved to crawl on the sea floor like modern crustaceans. This adaptation made it easy for them to venture onto land, and at the time, there would have been no animal competition on land to counter them. That's ignoring the fact that scorpions are the longest lived predators on Earth, having been around for over _**435 million years**_, nearly _triple_ the time non-avian dinosaurs have lived and having (so far) never once switched their diets to herbivory or the fact that they're most likely ancestors of the spiders the same way dinosaurs are ancestors to the birds.
-   Smaller scorpion species, such as the desert scorpion, are pretty dangerous. Should you come across one, the best thing to do is not to give it an excuse to attack you. But even then, it'd be no worse than a bee sting. Yes it would hurt, but it probably won't kill you unless you're allergic.
-   The Emperor Scorpion, probably the largest and most iconic scorpion species, is often used as the model for this trope, but fall for the Reality Is Unrealistic trap. They're one of the friendliest and least venomous species of scorpions. In general, the biggest scorpions, like the Emperor and the few others kept in the pet trade, are minimally venomous. This is because their claws are so big they can kill their prey with brute force and don't _need_ venom, whereas the smaller scorpions do. This video demonstrates how docile this species is, showing a keeper handle a very curious, adventuring emperor scorpion, without once being grabbed, stung, or bitten.
-   A lot of scorpion species actually avoid using their venom in self defense, relying instead on their powerful claws and protective exoskeletons to protect themselves. This is because they want to conserve their venom for when they need it (like killing prey).
-   Make no mistake, though — there are a few scorpions whose venom is potentially deadly, especially to less healthy individuals and children. Those include some fattail scorpions (the genus' Latin name is _Androctonus_, which translates to "man killer"), the equally appropriately named Deathstalker scorpion (whose venom is by far the most potent of any species in the world), the Indian red scorpion, and the Arizona bark scorpion (the latter of which being the most venomous species of scorpion found in North America).
-   The aforementioned Deathstalker is one of the most dangerous species with an extremely painful venom. While very painful, though, it probably won't kill you. The venom of the Deathstalker, known as Chlorotoxin, is a heavy target of medical research. It does two, remarkable things. One, it can actually help the body regulate insulin, which can help fight diabetes. Two, a synthetic version of the toxin can be used to target brain tumors. When lined with fluorescent molecules, the venom highlights cancer cells, which makes removing them significantly easier. The venom has been known to highlight instances of cancer only _200 cells strong._ 200 seems like a big number, but when you talk about brain cells, it's probably not enough to see with the naked eye.
-   While modern scorpions are strongly associated with arid environments like deserts, savannahs and scrublands, the Eurypterids, a group of ancient arthropods informally known as Sea Scorpions, lived, as the name suggests, in the ocean and other aquatic habitats. These grew to be much larger then any living scorpion, the biggest of them being _8 ft 2 in_. They went extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event. Despite the name, they weren't actually scorpions — although their closest living relatives would be arachnids — and only resembled them in their elongated body plan and their front limbs ending in large claws. They didn't have a sting (their bodies ended in flat paddles for swimming) and would have used their claws as their primary weapons.
-   Several actual species of giant scorpions have been found in the Paleozoic fossil record.
    -   _Pulmonoscorpius_, from the Carboniferous, grew to be a solid 70 cm (28 in) long, in large part thanks to the atmosphere's higher oxygen content at the time<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
    -   _Brontoscorpio_ was even bigger, reaching nearly a meter in length. One of the earliest scorpions known, it is also though to have been a strictly marine animal. Unfortunately, it’s only known from a single claw, thus making exact measurements impossible.
-   There's a scorpion in the sky too: the zodiacal constellation of Scorpius, that in the past was even bigger — the neighboring constellation of Libra was once its claws.
-   The scorpio was a giant crossbow-like Roman Siege Engines used to kill enemies at hundreds of meters.
-   The Whip Scorpion is a subversion. They look like really creepy scorpion-like creatures, but are biologically closer to spiders due to being tetrapulmonates, making them more of a Spiders Are Scary case instead.
