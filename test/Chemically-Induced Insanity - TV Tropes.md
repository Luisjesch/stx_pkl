Pictured: what happens when one is given a dose of Rajaijah Juice.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Despite being perfectly sane, a character is given drugs that make people around him think that he is insane. This is usually done maliciously and without the character's knowledge. Frequently done to get a character out of the way when killing them would be too messy, or simply to discredit them.

Often this would be maintained by having a caregiver giving the patient "medicine" to treat their mental illness, but in reality is dosing them to keep them insane. May be administered by Slipping a Mickey and/or Water Source Tampering. Can overlap with Go Mad from the Revelation if Higher Understanding Through Drugs opens the mind to secrets not meant for mortals to perceive.

Compare Psycho Serum where a character intentionally takes a drug to enhance himself, but it induces insanity as a side effect; also compare Infectious Insanity where insanity is induced by contact with an already insane person, and Mushroom Samba for cases where a character is under the influence of hallucinogens (voluntarily or otherwise). See also Gaslighting, another way in which one character can make another seem insane.

-   Inverted in an episode of _Leverage_, in which Parker checks into an addiction-treatment center as part of the team's latest con, where she is given anti-depressants and becomes temporarily relieved of her kleptomaniacal tendencies.

-   In the _Stingray (1985)_ episode "Playback", this turns out to be the cause of the violent deaths of most participants in an isolation experiment: A fire burnt some piping in the backup ventilation system, causing madness-inducing fumes to be ventilated throughout the building during a test of said backup system. The Sole Survivor was unaffected because he was doing a space walk simulation at the time, and thus on an independent air supply.
-   _Servant of the People_: Nina Yegorovna, Vasiliy's pick for head of State Security, is slipped a drug by her underlings, who resent the new administration's anti-corruption stance (and also probably hate taking orders from a woman).

Later, Mikhail, her replacement, discovers what happened to her and does the same thing to the security agents.

-   In _Hitman: Blood Money_, Agent Smith is given drugs to make him look as The Alcoholic.
-   In _Pokémon Sun and Moon_, UB-01's venom apparently has this effect on humans, removing the victim's moral and behavioral inhibitions and inflicting emotional extremes, and is also _addictive_. Lusamine's abusive Yandere obsession stems from _years_ of exposure to the stuff, and after her stint as Mother Beast she needs long-term medical care to recover.
-   In _We Happy Few_, the entire populace of Wellington Wells is addicted to "Joy", which causes people to forget their troubles (especially the "Very Bad Thing") but also causes hallucinations and erratic behavior.

Sequel Series _Rebels_ reveals that Rex eventually realized he was telling the truth.

    Real Life

-   The Stasi used methods, including drugs, to Gaslight dissidents.

-   A persistent Scare 'Em Straight Urban Legend holds that there is a man in an asylum who believes himself to be an orange after taking LSD. The story goes like this: A man enters Canada from the United States. He comes across an amazing deal on LSD, so he buys a lot of it, and tapes the sheet to his stomach. At the border, he's ordered to get out of his car and wait in a room while they search it. He gets so nervous that he starts sweating, which soaks the sheet and causes him to absorb a hundred hits of LSD through his skin. He then starts thinking he is an orange and has to peel himself, so he starts taking off his clothes. To this day, he is stuck in a psychiatric ward, still convinced he is an orange.
