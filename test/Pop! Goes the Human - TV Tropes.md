Eighty steaks with cumin  
Stuff 'em all inside of your face  
**POP!** goes the hu-man!"_

This is when Inflating Body Gag or Balloon Belly is taken to its logical conclusion. Fill a living organism or some random body part with enough food, water, air, etc. and it will eventually burst. Of course, when this is applied to Death by Gluttony, it's usually Played for Laughs. There is little actual Truth in Television to this, as, while the skin can indeed rupture, it wouldn't do so drastically in most cases. Even barring that, the internal organs you are filling (stomach, lungs, nasal area) would rupture long before the skin itself. Yet in fiction, the rupture is simply measured by the body exploding.

Can sometimes be Nausea Fuel, though in lighter works, the lack of blood and gore may counter this somewhat. Sometimes the body just pops and disappears, though sometimes, the exploding body will shoot the contents it was filled with everywhere, with the actual body parts not showing up. Sometimes the character's explosion is caused by an outside force such as a sharp object. In many cases, the character often regenerates shortly after exploding.

Largely a Discredited Trope, as it was mostly born from an Urban Legend that eating too much would make a person explode, then evolved to other forms of humans popping from overfilling. However, it is still sometimes used in works that are not going for realism, and is a timeless favourite as a Scare 'Em Straight cautionary tale against Gluttony. Also favored in comedy, for the logical reason that it mixes Stuff Blowing Up with Vulgar Humor.

Not to be confused with Action Bomb (although there are rare cases of overlap), where people pop more like firecrackers than balloons, and on purpose.

## As this is a Death Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.
