_"Better safe than sorry, Better safe than sorry, Better safe than sorry, I can't believe he bit me!! Better safe than sorry! I, I opened the door before and I got bit for my trouble. No. Won't fool me twice. Better safe than sorry! **Better safe than sorry!**"_

Characters who are having a mental breakdown sometimes become fixated on a certain phrase that they repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat until everyone in the world is sick of it. This could be from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or due to ruminative depression, where a person becomes trapped in a loop.

Sometimes, this chanting allows the character to snap out of their insanity. Sometimes, it becomes their life-long theme song as they rock back and forth in a padded, locked room in a psychiatric institute. If they aren't locked up, expect a room with every square inch covered with the handwitten phrase. When combined with As the Good Book Says..., the ominousness goes through the roof.

Just about every mental institution scene has someone chanting some sort of non sequitur phrase in the background. And woe betide us all if this non sequitur should be significant.

May result in the terms becoming meaningless and possibly descend into a strange form of Mondegreen thanks to the human knack of picking up patterns out of nothing.

Contrast the Talkative Loon, who at least varies the chatter. Compare to Cluster F-Bomb and Rapid-Fire "No!". If this involves singing, see Tuneless Song of Madness.

A Survival Mantra is an attempt to master fear and pain, but when it doesn't work, you find the point where that trope crosses over into this one.

Must trope. Must trope. Must trope. Must trope. Must trope. Must trope.

-   In Grant Morrison's run on _Animal Man_, the Arkham inmate Psycho Pirate chants phrases such as, "Worldswillliveworldswilldie," and "One and two and ess and ex and three and four and prime." These turn out to be Arc Words, referring to the parallel Earths variously merged or destroyed in _Crisis on Infinite Earths_ some years earlier. The Psycho Pirate is the only one in the DCU who remembers these lost worlds, and so these Madness Mantras allude to, respectively, DC's promotional tagline for the _Crisis_ crossover and the names of various parallel Earths (Earth Two, Earth S, Earth X, etc.). His ravings are a premonition of the temporary reemergence of superheroes and supervillains from the lost Earths.

His final descent into madness begins when he sees the spiders congregate to form a gigantic and monstrous spider that attacks him. At first, he believes that it is an hallucination and tries to fight it off. But he soon concludes that:
    
    **Kraven:** It’s true. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true.
    
-   In _Legion of Super-Heroes_ storyline _The Great Darkness Saga_, -Darkseid brainwashes thee billions of Daxamites — a Kryptonian offshoot — into conquering the galaxy for him.

-   In _V for Vendetta_, after V destroys Lewis Prothero's priceless doll collection in front of him, he goes insane, and can only say "mama, mama."

-   _The Night Unfurls_: Despite being unable to speak, Hugh finds himself repeatedly mouthing the word "Boss" upon witnessing Shamuhaza thrashing in agony and seemingly dying under Kyril's literal Death Glare.

-   In _The Precious Book_, Harry greatly cares for a copy of _Alice in Wonderland_ given to him by a kindly bookshop owner, regarding the characters as his friends.

    **Dane**: ...and then as you're crying, what happens is that it starts to feel good... and what you do is that you latch on to one phrase that you just repeat over and over again; just something that means something to you, like, "I DID MY BEST! I DID MY BEST!"
    
-   Lewis Black had one of these inflicted on him due to overhearing an Orphaned Punchline - "If it weren't for my horse, I wouldn't have spent that year in college."

Psychologist David Rosenhan wanted to reveal the poor conditions of some mental hospitals and developed a test: eight perfectly healthy individuals (including himself) from different backgrounds went to psychiatrists and explained that they had been hearing voices repeat the words "Empty," "Hollow," and "Thud" non-stop in their heads (the words were apparently chosen because they sounded vaguely nihilistic). All eight were admitted to mental hospitals, where they proceeded to act normal and say that the voices had stopped—and all eight ended up having to admit to having mental disorders and take antipsychotic drugs.
-   A computer science researcher was getting very, very sick of being repeatedly spammed by a bogus computer science journal, so he submitted a 10-page paper (originally authored by an antispam group who had been similarly spammed) consisting entirely of the phrase "Get me off your fucking mailing list," complete with a flowchart and scatter plot illustrating the same phrase.

Man Has Nothing Good With Which To Recompense Heaven. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill.** It's even said that people were so terrified of the sheer malice contained in the "Seven Kill Stele" that they feared touching it, let alone destroying it, and it was only blasted to pieces in 1970. Though, bear in mind, this whole story may be apocryphal to an unknown degree.
