_"When you get to Hell, tell 'em Penwood sent you! And then apologize on my behalf for the inconvenience."_

— **Sir Penwood's** final words to a vampire Nazi officer in _Hellsing Ultimate Abridged_, _Lay Back and Think of Oblivion_

A stock Pre-Mortem One-Liner which usually comes in two flavours:

From the killer to the victim. Often told from the villain to the Disposable Woman or anyone close to The Hero that they're about to kill. When it's The Hero saying this, it's usually to Mooks attempting to avenge their boss or to an enemy upon the issue of a Duel to the Death. When a villain says it _to_ The Hero, it's usually to rub it in their face that their death will mean they failed to avenge the villain's previous victims. Which often backfires on the villain.

From the victim to their friends or sometimes the killer themselves. The Tear Jerker variant which is usually found among the True Companions when one of them is dying in the arms of one of his comrades, usually along the lines of _"Meet you on the other side"_.

This One-Liner is sometimes used in the context of a Mercy Kill but it's rarer.
