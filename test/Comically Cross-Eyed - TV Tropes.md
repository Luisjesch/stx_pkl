Double viewing pleasure, according to Ben Turpin.

_"Oh no, I've gone cross-eyed."_

— **Austin Powers**, _Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me_

People with crossed eyes or taking on a crossed eyes expression are a Stock Joke in popular culture. They are either seen as silly, crazy or stupid. Whenever they appear you may rest assured that they will see double, accidentally drop something out of their hands or speak with a goofy voice. Can be combined with a Maniac Tongue sticking out from under their lips.

In Real Life _strabismus_ is a serious condition and poking fun of it is likely to offend some people, as it's a relatively common disorder. Despite this it's still an Acceptable Target in most circles, and mockery of strabismus is surprisingly common even in modern media.

They may also be shown to see double, note that this isn't always the case in real life, especially for people who have had strabismus since early childhood, as their brain has usually adapted by ignoring the image coming from the deviating eye.

When he finds out that Ben Turpin, the patron saint of this trope, has been cast in his film, Merton is horrified. Baird the director, who is actually making a slapstick satire of westerns but doesn't want Merton to know what he's starring in, lies and says that Ben Turpin has always dreamed of playing a dramatic role.
    
    **Merton**: Those cross-eyed comedies are kind of debasing to a noble art.

-   Downplayed in _Silence of the Lambs_: one of the entomologists Starling consults about the cocoon found at the autopsy of one of Buffalo Bill's victims is noticeably cross-eyed (though not as bad as the comedy examples above).

The cross-eye was originally an animation mistake, but she became one of the more popular characters in the show and even received a Fan Nickname: Derpy Hooves. This nickname became canon in the episode "The Last Roundup" before some people complained that it was offensive and the creators backpedaled, editing the episode to remove said name. She was later given the more innocent name Muffins in the episode "Slice of Life", and packaging for her merchandise generally shows a picture of a muffin instead of a name. The episode also focuses on her long enough to show that her eyes' positions aren't fixed, instead listing around as she turns her head, implying it's some kind of lazy eye ailment.

They are mine and let me tell you, Mrs. Grant, you had better not make any experiments, as I might not like you half so well with any other eyes."
