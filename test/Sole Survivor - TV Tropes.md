_"And I alone am escaped to tell thee."_

It could happen in a lot of ways. Your family picnic is gunned down by The Mafia. Your platoon is ordered to do something suicidal by General Ripper. Your ship goes down. Your Doomed Hometown has a volcano erupt on it. You were Playing Possum when wounded. You were knocked unconscious during the Last Stand. You were the lucky duck who did not find the Applied Phlebotinum lethal. You were sent to Bring News Back. You were ordered to perform some errand, often stunningly trivial, which left you off-base when the surprise attack overwhelmed it. But somehow you alone survive this horrible event. You've become the Sole Survivor.

This is the eventual outcome of a Dwindling Party. It can lead to Survivor Guilt or a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. A Sole Survivor may become a Zen Survivor or Shellshocked Veteran.

If your entire world/race/culture has been wiped out, you're the Last of His Kind, which gets its own page. If your entire world/race/culture has been wiped out and you're the only survivor because _you did it_, that's Genocide from the Inside. This can overlap with Genocide Survivor, but one can be a Genocide Survivor without being the last member of that people.

Compare Spare a Messenger, Everybody's Dead, Dave, and Final Girl. Contrast any story with an Undead Author. Not to be confused with the summer camp Soul Survivor, the winner of the reality TV show _Survivor_, or the 1984 horror movie _Sole Survivor_ (though the protagonist is an example).

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Area 88_ has Boris, a pilot famous for always coming back alone. The TV series introduces him when some rookie tempts fate by saying they've survived a mission with him. He dies after demonstrating that the F8E Crusader can fly with its wings folded.
-   _Attack on Titan_:
    -   Reiner Braun is the only one of the four Warriors sent to infiltrate Paradis Island to make it back to his hometown alive. Marcel was eaten by Ymir's mindless Titan form (which allowed her to absorb the Jaws Titan and regain her mind), Bertholt was killed to save Armin and give him the Colossal Titan, and Annie is still alive, but she's in a self-induced Crystal Prison in enemy territory.
    -   Eren's father Grisha is the only member of the Eldian restorationists who were sent to Paradis Island to be Titanised that survived. He watched all his comrades, and his first wife Dina, be turned into mindless Titans by the Marleyan military. One of those military officers, Kruger, then revealed that he was a Titan Shifter, killed the other officers, and (after a large serving of exposition) gave Grisha his Titan power and sent Grisha on his mission to infiltrate the Walls.
    -   Floch Forster, a Red Shirt, is the sole survivor of Erwin's suicide charge against Zeke. Technically, Erwin survived too but was mortally injured by one of Zeke's projectiles. While Floch tried to save him, Erwin wanted to die alongside his men and Levi respected his last wish, saving Armin instead.
    -   By the end of story, Levi is the only one remaining of all the original members of the Survey Corps.
-   When everything finally reaches its conclusion in _Aura Battler Dunbine_, only Cham Fau is left to relate the tale of Byston Well, as told by the Mi Ferrario.
-   Subverted in _Berserk_. Guts is initially set up in the Black Swordsman arc as the only survivor of whatever massacre led him on his vendetta against Griffith and the demon lords of the God Hand. But the Golden Age arc, which tells the story of Guts's time with Griffith and his Band of the Hawk before the events of that arc, reveals that there were _two_ other survivors of the Band of the Hawk: Rickert, who was the only survivor of the group that got separated from the main group when the Hawks were declared outlaw following Griffith's arrest for boinking Princess Charlotte, and who thus wasn't there with the others when the Eclipse went down; and Casca, Guts's greatest love and the only other survivor of the Eclipse, who received the Brand of Sacrifice much like he did when Griffith sacrificed everyone, but who lost her mind following a truly horrific ordeal at the hands of the demons and Griffith himself. The survival of these two sets up the Conviction arc in which Guts has to step away from his path of vengeance and blood in order to save Casca from a bunch of cultists and a fanatical high inquisitor.
-   This is an idea that recurs a number of times in _Birdy the Mighty: Decode_. The most prominent examples are the two seasons' main villains, Shyamalan and Nataru. The former was the only one in a gathering of 4,000 to survive a terrorist attack in his homeland, while the latter was the only one to survive a blast from the Ryunka that killed his best friend. Both instances ended up being the Start of Darkness of those affected.
-   _Bleach_: Uryū Ishida is the last surviving Gemischt Quincy in the world. Six years before the manga begins, the Quincy King Yhwach carried out an Auswählen which depowered and killed all other Gemischt Quincies, including Uryū's mother Kanae and Ichigo's mother Masaki. Uryū is the only mixed-blood in history to have survived an Auswählen. As a result, he's the last mixed-blood quincy alive. Yhwach is determined to make use of the mysterious ability that Uryū possesses that allowed him to survive something that should have killed him.
-   In the _Bokurano_ anime, Kana Ushiro is the only one of the chosen kids who lives on. She dies in the two other continuities, though.
-   _Buso Renkin_: Tokiko Tsumura was the only survivor of a homunculus attack on her elementary school when she was 10. The event was so traumatic that it left her an intense hatred of homunculi, and very few memories of her life before the incident.
-   _Code Geass_:
    -   Claudio Darlton, the leader of the Glaston Knights unit in _Code Geass R2_, is the last person of his unit left after the other four pilots and their mechs were crushed by a base, irradiated and blown up, downed by having a chain-sword driven into them and sliced up, respectively. What makes this worse is the fact that they're all adopted brothers, and that their father died in combat a year ago.
    -   Marika Soresi, a member of Luciano Bradley's Valkyrie Squadron and Kewell Soresi's younger sister, is the last person of her team left after the other four, including their leader, get destroyed by Kallen during the Second Battle of Tokyo in _Code Geass: Oz the Reflection_. Before the manga revealed that Marika survived, it was a Total Party Kill.
-   Hei was the sole survivor in _Darker than Black_ Gaiden OVA episode 4 during Yin's awakening as Izanami. He was spared due to "white" Yin's interference against "Black" Yin.

-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   In the Bad Future of _Dragon Ball Z_, Gohan was the sole survivor of the first battle with the androids. He spends the rest of his life (nearly two decades) fleeing, training, fighting the androids, and looking after Vegeta's son, Trunks, in the hopes that eventually one of them would grow strong enough to end their reign of terror.
    -   By the final episode of _Dragon Ball Super_, Android 17 became the sole surviving member for Universe 7 in the Tournament of Power (everyone who lost got erased), thus winning the tournament for his universe and was the only person who gets rewarded a wish via the Super Dragon Balls.
        -   While he was _also_ the only one of all the fighters left, his wish popped every last person who had been erased (including whole universes) back to life.
-   _Fabricant 100_: Ashibi Yao is the only survivor of the Yao family massacre.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_: Van Hohenheim was the only survivor of the destruction of the kingdom of Xerxes.
-   A major subversion happens in _Getter Robo Armageddon_ - the Getter Team arrives in an outpost in Manhattan responding to a distress signal, only to find that the only survivors are a couple of adorable puppies. It isn't until the battle's over and everyone's relaxing when they realize something - how could anyone have sent the signal if the puppies were the only ones there? (It was a trap.)
-   Out of a family of seven, Henrietta from _Gunslinger Girl_ was the only one to survive a robbery. To make matters worse the robbers spent the rest of the night brutally raping her right next to her family's corpses, and Henrietta couldn't have been older than thirteen.

    -   Emporio Alniño is the sole survivor of the heroes in _Stone Ocean_. F.F. sacrificed her life to save Jotaro's Memory disc, Weather Report was killed by his brother Enrico Pucci, and Narciso Anasui, Ermes Costello, Jotaro Kujo, and even Jolyne Cujoh were killed by Pucci's Made In Heaven Stand, and Emporio ended up being the one to defeat Made In Heaven and the only one to remember the original universe after the Reset Button Ending (that revived the main cast aside from F.F., but without their memories).
        -   Related to this, because of Jotaro Kujo's death in _Stone Ocean_, Joseph Joestar is the only member of the namesake Stardust Crusaders who is still alive at the end of the old universe's continuity, as besides Jotaro dying in _Stone Ocean_, Jean-Pierre Polnareff was killed at the hands of Diavolo in _Golden Wind_ (and barely clings to life by inhabiting the turtle Coco Jumbo's Stand as a ghost), and back in _Stardust Crusaders_, Muhammad Avdol and Iggy were killed by Vanilla Ice's Stand, Cream, while Noriaki Kakyoin was killed by DIO and The World.
-   _Kirby: Right Back at Ya!_: Ultimately subverted with Meta Knight. At first it seems he's the only Star Warrior left alive, after all the others were killed fighting the forces of Nightmare.

    -   Tohma from _Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force_. He's currently on a quest to find out who are the ones behind the destruction of his hometown.

    -   Granz and Elenora Florian were the only survivors of the Eltrian Planet Reclamation Committee slaughter in the backstory of _Reflection_ and _Detonation_, as they both happened to be off base at the time.

-   _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_: Louise Halevy's entire family was massacred at a wedding. She lost her hand in the attack but was otherwise the only survivor.
-   Terry Sanders Jr. in _Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team_ suffers from the bad luck of having every team he's in getting wiped out except for him on their third mission together, earning the nickname of "Shinigami" (The Reaper) in the dub).
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Sasuke Uchiha, the page image survived the killing of his whole clan by his older brother Itachi Uchiha and the latter's collaborator Obito Uchiha. While the trope was initially subverted given that Itachi and Obito were still alive, it's played straight by the end of the manga, as Sasuke outlives them both.
    -   Kakashi Hatake is the only living member of Team Minato. His friends Obito Uchiha and Rin Nohara both died during the Third Great Ninja War, while his sensei Minato Namikaze died during the Nine Tails' attack. Coupled with his father's suicide years ago, it really fueled into Kakashi's massive survivor guilt and self-hatred, as well as his Papa Wolf tendecies towards Team 7. While Obito is later revealed to be alive, he has become such a changed man that Kakashi hardly recognizes him. And he bites the dust during the Fourth Great Ninja War anyway, leaving Kakashi as the only survivor again.
        
        **Sasuke**: "Maybe if I was to kill the most important people in your life... everyone who's ever meant anything... maybe then I'd listen to you, because maybe then you'd have some idea how I feel!"
        
        **Kakashi**: "Hmm... that's an interesting theory, but I'm afraid you're a little late to put it to the test. Everyone you're talking about has already been killed."

-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_:
    -   Laura Roslin, Secretary of Education, becomes President of the Colonies when the rest of the government (and most of the colonies) gets killed by Cylons.
    -   The only major character from the Battlestar _Pegasus_ to survive the whole series is Louis Hoshi.
    -   Of all the Viper pilot candidates Starbuck trains in the episode 'Act of Contrition,' the only survivor is Brendan 'Hot Dog' Costanza. In fact, not even Kara herself makes it to the end alive.
-   _Blackadder Goes Forth_:
    -   In the last episode, it's revealed that George is the last of the "Trinity Tiddlers", a group of college friends who all joined up when the war began. About five minutes later, George leads a charge against a German trench and is killed too. Yes, this is a comedy.
    -   Similarly, Baldrick is the last remnant of the Turnip Street Workhouse Pals Batallion. He doesn't survive the ending either.
-   Cally, the final member to join _Blake's 7_ in Season 1, is a Human Alien who due to her differing biology survived when the Terran Federation wiped out the entire population of a rebellious planet with bioweapons. She's from a telepathic species so finds the isolation particularly difficult to cope with, and is planning to give her life in a Suicide Attack before Blake turns up. Blake himself was the sole survivor of the massacre of a rebel group, but in that case, it was because the Federation wanted him alive; as the Rebel Leader he could be interrogated, then brainwashed into publicly recanting his cause.
-   _Branded (1965)_: Jason McCord was the sole survivor of the Bitter Creek Massacre.
-   In _Chinese Paladin_, the Sword Saint is the sole survivor of the Mt. Shu massacre.
-   In _Crusade_, Captain Matthew Gideon was the sole survivor of the destruction of the EAS _Cerberus_. This is also an example of government cover-up — the official story is that the _Cerberus_ was destroyed by a jump engine failure; however, then-ensign Gideon (who was outside doing an EVA mission) saw the ship being attacked by a ship with obvious Shadow technology.
-   _CSI: NY_: Lindsay Monroe/Messer, the only survivor of the massacre of her friends in the diner when she was a teenager.
-   _Deadliest Warrior_: If the episode pits groups up against each other, then in almost all cases, only one member of the winning side is left standing in the resulting battle. The only exception is "Al Capone vs. Jesse James", in which both Jesse and Frank James survive.
-   _Designated Survivor_: Similarly, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Tom Kirkman becomes President of the USA when the Capitol Building is bombed during the State of the Union. Unlike Roslin's accidental "promotion" this is a real, actual plan in case the US government is attacked (though _Entertainment Weekly_ notes that Tom doesn't know about the plan until he's called up while in real life everyone in government is aware; this is to show how he isn't really a "political insider").
    -   While Kirkman is the only member of the cabinet to survive, (and is thusly heir to the presidency) Congresswoman Kimble Hookstratten is the only surviving member of Congress by virtue of being the designated survivor for the Republican Party (Kirkman is an Independent, but served in a Democratic administration) until Congressman Peter MacLeish is dug out of the rubble. MacLeish meanwhile is the only person _in general_ to have survived the blast that destroyed the Capitol Building and killed upwards of twelve-hundred people. His survival, however, was intended, as he is a member of the domestic anti-government conspiracy at work.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   After the events of "Logopolis", Nyssa is the last survivor from Trakken after her home planet is destroyed and her father is killed.
    -   In "The Long Game", Eva St. Julien, a.k.a. Suki MacRae Cantrell, is the last surviving member of the Freedom Fifteen.
-   In the Season 2 finale of _Flashpoint_, the subject had been a soldier in Afghanistan, and happened to drop back to take a drink from his canteen just moments before the unit was hit by an explosive device; because he had dropped back, he was far enough away from the explosion to survive, while all of the others were killed. He suffered from severe Survivor Guilt because of it, eventually leading him to commit Suicide by Cop.
-   _Game of Thrones_: Cley Cerwyn, of House Cerwyn. Ramsay flayed all the other members.
-   The eponymous character of _Iglot_ is of a species called the Unggiko that was mass-murdered to near exctinction by the Ravena. Aviona saved Iglot from harm during this event, making him the sole surviving member of the species.
-   _Jessica Jones (2015)_: Jessica Jones was the sole survivor of the car accident that killed her entire family — or so she thinks. It turns out that her mother also survived, but Dr. Karl Malus decided to declare Alisa dead so he could perform somewhat illegal experimentation on her.
-   _Legion (2017)_: Gabrielle is the sole surviving member of her family; all of her relatives were exterminated by the Nazis.
-   _NUMB3RS_: In "Provenance", Erika Hellman was the only member of her family in Berlin who survived the Holocaust, _and was six years old at the time_.
    
    **Erika**: You have no idea what it's like to be the only survivor of your family and to have no idea why.
    
-   _The Outer Limits (1995)_:
    -   In "The Light Brigade", the Chief Weapons Officer was the only survivor of the _General Patton_, one of the UNDF's most advanced ships which was easily defeated by the aliens.
    -   In "Bits of Love", Aidan Hunter may be the last living person on Earth in June 2047, seven months after a nuclear holocaust.
    -   In "The Beholder", there are two examples. Patrick Tarloff's parents were killed when their single-engine airplane crashed in the vicinity of Fort Yukon, Alaska. Patrick, who was seven years old, was the only survivor but was blinded. Similarly, Kyra was the only member of her family to survive the crash of their ship, which was severely damaged when it got too close to Earth's magnetic field.
    -   In "The Vessel", there are likewise two examples. Jake Worthy is the only member of the seven-person team onboard the space shuttle _Inspire_ to survive the crash. The alien lifeform that entered Jake's body was travelling on board a ship with his mate, his child, and others when it collided with a meteor. His mate and child were killed in the collision while all of the other survivors were converted into electrical impulses and eventually vanished into the ether, leaving only the relevant alien.
-   _Power Rangers Dino Fury_: Zayto and his fellow Knights of Rafkon were seemingly the only six people to escape their planet's destruction at the hands of the Sporix. They followed the Sporix to Earth to prevent it's destruction as well, but after that battle the only person left was Zayto.
-   _Sharpe_: It is revealed in _Sharpe's Challenge_ that Sharpe was the sole survivor of an attack on an East India Company outpost in India.
-   _Space: Above and Beyond_ depicted several characters as this:
    -   Major McKendrick, discovered by the 58th behind enemy lines after his unit was wiped out.
    -   Lt. Col. Butts is ultimately revealed to be the lone survivor of his previous squadron; the 58th's first mission after he assumes command is to bury his squadmates and retrieve their Hammerheads.
    -   Possibly McQueen himself; at the very least, he seems to be the only member of the Angry Angels still fit for duty.
    -   Played with in "Stay with the Dead", in which the 58th try a Faking the Dead ploy that convinces their own side as well as the enemy.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   Occurs in several _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episodes.
        -   "The Cage": Vina, survivor of a spaceship crash.
        -   "Charlie X": The title character, also a spaceship crash survivor.
        -   "The Conscience of the King": It's revealed that Kirk very nearly becomes this for a massacre he witnessed in his youth, as he finds that seven of the other eight witnesses have been killed off in the preceding years, and an attempt is made on the life of the eighth, a subordinate of Kirk's named Kevin Riley. Fortunately, McCoy is able to pull Riley through.
        -   "Balance of Terror": Commander Hansen in Earth Outpost 4 after the initial Romulan attack.
        -   "Arena": The survivor of the Gorn attack on Cestus Three.
        -   "The Doomsday Machine": Commodore Matt Decker. Has severe Survivor Guilt.
        -   "The Omega Glory": Captain Ronald Tracey after his entire crew dies from a virus they picked up on Omega IV.
        -   "That Which Survives": Losira. Subverted in the end when we find out that she didn't survive.
    -   Subverted with Worf in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_. For many years Worf and his friends believed him to be the sole survivor of the Romulan attack on Khitomer. However in "Sins of the Father" Worf and the _Enterprise_ crew learn that Worf's nanny also survived the attack and was living on the Klingon homeworld. Later, Worf learns in the episode "Birthright" that a number of Klingons on Khitomer were taken prisoner by the Romulans and were still alive in the 2360s.
    -   La'an in _Star Trek: Strange New Worlds_ is the Sole Survivor of a Gorn attack when she was a child.
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   Shaw with the claw-shaped scar in "Wendigo" was the sole survivor of the titular monster's attack on the cabin where he and his parents were staying decades ago.
    -   Kali is the only one of the assembled deities who survives the massacre by Lucifer in "Hammer of the Gods".
    -   In "The Great Escapist", Kara alone was left mutilated but alive among the carnage with a message for Castiel. Once Cass got the message, Naomi kills Kara anyway.
        
        **Kara:** They said you have to stop.
        
    -   When she's first introduced, Hannah is the only angel who survived an attack by Metatron. The latter reveals afterward that he did it on purpose.
    -   In "Ladies Drink Free", the Hidden Villain werewolf was the survivor of a massacre by the British Men of Letters on his peaceful-living pack.
    -   In Apocalypse World, Maggie and Floyd when first introduced are the only survivors of a band of hunters attacked by rabid vampires. Floyd is later killed by a vampire while navigating a tunnel, so Maggie is the last one left.
-   _Survivor_:
    -   The winner is a mild version, as the other players are "voted off" the show rather than killed.
    -   In any season where tribal lines are strong, usually one tribe bands together to knock out the opposing tribe in a merged situation. Such a move became known as _Pagonging_, a name going back to the first season during which the former Tagi Tribe members stuck together even post-merge to rid the game of all the members of their former enemy, the Pagong Tribe. The sole survivor from a Pagonged tribe usually makes a remark about being the last of their original tribe left in the game.
-   _The Terror_: The first season is a fictionalized account of the Franklin Expedition, which was historically lost with all hands. The story ends pretty much the same way, and the only survivor is Francis Crozier, the captain of the _HMS Terror._ He alone survives amongst a native arctic tribe until the rescue party finally arrives, but he opts to have the chief of the the tribe tell said rescue party that nobody survived. His naval career was already at a dead end before the disaster because he's Irish and has no chance of making flag rank, he has zero chance to be with the woman that he loves, he failed to save anyone from his command or any of his friends in spite of his own best efforts, and he has nothing but disgrace waiting for him back home, so he opts to live out his life with the natives, whose culture he feels more at home in.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_:
    -   In "Time Enough at Last", Henry Bemis finally has all the time in the world to enjoy reading when he's the only survivor of a nuclear war... then he goes and breaks his last pair of glasses.
    -   In "One More Pallbearer", Paul Radin offers three people who wronged him the chance to ride out an atomic attack in his personal underground shelter, but they all refuse. Then, the attack happens. Devastated, he emerges into the ruins of the city, but the Karmic Twist Ending reveals that the attack wasn't real — he's hallucinated it out of guilt.
    -   In "The Thirty-Fathom Grave", Chief Bell was the only survivor of the sinking of the submarine _714_.
    -   In "The Old Man in the Cave", Mr. Goldsmith is the only survivor of the Village after the other residents, Major French and his men all eat the canned food that the Old Man warned them was contaminated with Strontium-90.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1985)_:
    -   A variation in "A Little Peace and Quiet". Penny has a stopwatch with the power to stop time. She uses it when World War III starts between the US and the Soviet Union, only to find that she's stopped time just as the town was moments from being obliterated by a bomb. Now she's faced with a choice: live out her life effectively alone, or die with everyone else.
    -   In "Still Life", the 86-year-old Professor Alex Stottel is the last surviving member of Dr. Levinson's expedition to the Amazon River basin, where they encountered the Curacai, in January 1913. Stottel was a 13-year-old boy at the time.

    Music 

-   "Prairie Fire" by Tumbleweed Tex:
    
    "Just one He left to tell the tale, just one was His desire. We lost the herd and 30 men to a raging prairie fire."
    
-   "Barrett's Privateers" by Stan Rogers, about a disastrous expedition during the Revolutionary War.
    
    "Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier, the last of Barrett's Privateers."
    
-   "Mariner's Revenge Song" by The Decemberists is initially subverted in that that there are two survivors, but there will soon only be one, as seen in the last verse.
    
    "So lean in close/And I will whisper/The last words you'll hear."
    
-   The song "The Irish Rover" tells the story of a massive sailing ship in the early 19th century. After spending a verse describing the immensity of the ship ("she had twenty-seven masts!") and two verses describing the crew, the final verse describes the ship running into trouble (either a mechanical breakdown or an outbreak of measles, depending on the version) and a mighty storm, ending the song with the line "Now I'm the last of the _Irish Rover_."
-   "Lone Survivor" by Peter Schilling from _Things to Come_, which is about a single person surviving a nuclear holocaust through "a fortress made of steel".
-   "Sole Survivor" from Asia.
-   "Sole Survivor" by Blue Öyster Cult, about the last human alive.
    
    "There walked a lonely man/Silent, mute, the only man/Not knowing how, not knowing why/Was he the sole survivor"
    
    "Why should he be alive/Breathing still while others died/And the only question/Why was he the sole survivor?"
    
-   One point of "Weird Al" Yankovic's "Albuquerque" has the singer as the lone survivor of a plane crash. Why? Because he had his tray table up and his seat back in the full upright position.
-   The narrator of "Survivor" by Pretty Balanced is the only one left in her town, for reasons that are never stated within the song.
-   Helloween's "Sole Survivor":
    
    "Sole survivor/Of a kill without alert/Sing your feelings out/Your song remains unheard"
    

    Myths & Religion 

-   In Arthurian Legend, Sir Bedivere is stuck with this. As Tennyson has him say in _Idylls of the King_:
    
    _But now the whole Round Table is dissolved  
    Which was an image of the mighty world;  
    And I, the last, go forth companionless,  
    And the days darken round me, and the years,  
    Among new men, strange faces, other minds._
    
-   According to Norse Mythology, only six gods (Vidarr, Vali, Baldr, Hothr, (four of Odin's sons) Mothi, and Magni (two of Thor's sons)) and two humans (Lif and Lifthrasir) will survive Surtr's flames during Ragnarok.
-   _The Odyssey_: Odysseus ends up being the only one of all of his men to make it back home to Ithaca, the others perishing in the various disasters that befall them.
-   Older Than Dirt: In the Old Kingdom Egyptian Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor, the protagonist was the only survivor of his ship after a storm on the Red Sea. He washes up on an exotic island inhabited by giant talking snakes, which may or may not be deities.

    Pinballs 

-   _Golden Logres_ starts with the player as Sir Bedivere, the last surviving Knight of the Round Table. He must revive the other eleven knights to ultimately lead to King Arthur's resurrection.

    Radio 

-   _Dimension X_'s "Dwellers in Silence": Dr Cornelius Hathaway is the only surviving human on Earth in 2007 as all other survivors of the Earth Wars settled on Mars 20 years earlier. Hathaway managed to survive as he was in his lead-lined laboratory in the Sierra Mountains when the radioactive dust cloud enveloped the United States. His family didn't.
-   _The Lone Ranger_: The titular Ranger was the sole survivor of an ambush that wiped out a Texas Ranger patrol.

    Roleplay 

-   The RP series _Darwin's Soldiers_ has a theme of battles that leave a single person alive on one side (usually the enemy side):
    -   In the Furtopia RP, Zachary's team leaves one terrorist alive after a shootout so they can interrogate him.
    -   In the Gang Of Five RP, the first shootout at the AWTR explicitly states that only one female terrorist survives.
    -   When Shelton's team is attacked by sublevel guards, Shelton is the only one left awake. It turns out they needed him for the password to auxiliary control.
    -   Shelton is also the only avatar still alive by the end of the simulation in _Schrodinger's Prisoners_.
    -   When James' team launches a counter-assault, a single terrorist gets a shattered kneecap instead of death.
    -   In the second RP, Dragonstorm guards disarm or incapacitate every defender in the control room except Clyco, who activates a BFG and kills all the attackers except PFC Reynolds.
    -   Noleson is the only survivor of the security team that tries to arrest James and his men. At least, before Pelvanida is blown up...
    -   When a rocket hits the gunner bay of an escaping Lab 101, everyone inside is killed except Shelton, who was unconscious on the ground. He seems to have a habit of this.
    -   Shelton is knocked out with everyone else in _Nietzsche's Soldiers_. This time it's Kerzach who's left awake.
    -   In _Pavlov's Checkmate_, Hans knocks out a Russian enemy before the shooting starts, presumably leaving the Russian the only enemy survivor.
    -   When DS-1 ambushed James' team after incapacitating their van, "Achates" (later revealed to be Shelton) was the only one who didn't die.
    -   Part of Ethan Garner's backstory involves being the only survivor from 'Delta Force', though Ethan's author left the RP before explaining what that meant.
    -   When a police force fights Terror Squad, Jayden is the only officer left alive.
    -   When Terror Squad attacks the Schutzhund competition, Hailey is the only survivor.
-   In _Survival of the Fittest_, this is the obvious fate of anyone who wins the game, as the entire point is for the students to kill each other until only one remains. _Battle Royale_ works on a similar system, but is more idealistic. However, Shogo Kawada fits the trope at first and pretends to be the sole survivor of the Shiroiwa game to aid Nanahara and Nakagawa in their escape.

    Tabletop Games 

-   This is very common in TTRP Gs due to the turn-based format. Once the players kill all but one of a group of bad guys, it's not unheard of for the party to decide to capture the last mook standing, either to interrogate them for information or to strong-arm them into becoming their unpaid servant.
-   In _Paranoia_, this is actually a recommended way to win—you can blame all the bad stuff on the dead, and take credit for all the good stuff "without fear of contradiction". But sometimes The Computer is suspicious of Sole Survivors, so it may be better to let a couple live and bribe/blackmail them into backing up your story.
-   An attrition-based board game, _Stay Alive_, had the tagline "I'm the sole survivor!" in its '70s TV advertisements. Here's Vincent Price uttering the phrase in one spot.

    Theater 

-   Horatio in _Hamlet_, after virtually every other character (the ones who aren't already dead) drops dead around him the last scene of the play. Even he reaches for the poisoned cup to kill himself but Hamlet stops him.
    
    **Hamlet:** O good Horatio, what a wounded name,  
    Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!  
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart  
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,  
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,  
    To tell my story.
    
-   Discussed in _RENT_ by Mark. As he watches his friend group starting to fall apart in Act 2 due to HIV/AIDS and broken relationships, he wonders if and when he will eventually be the only one left.
    
    _Why am I the witness?  
    And when I capture it on film  
    Will it mean that it's the end  
    And I'm alone?_
    
-   The selection of who will become this via the grand prize of The Amazing Karnak's game is a major plot point in _Ride the Cyclone_. In the end, the honour goes to Jane/Penny Lamb as the other five victims of the Cyclone Disaster decide to give the grand prize to her, thus moving on to whatever comes next, with the only living members of the cast up to that point, Karnak and Virgil, dying soon after. Just as Karnak had predicted they would.

    Video Games 

-   One ending of the uncut edition of _Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere_ is titled "Sole Survivor", referring to Fiona Fitzerald, who is the only major character to be still alive at that point. Nemo would count, too, but he is not exactly alive.
-   By the time _The Black Heart_ ends, with Hashi dropped down a pit, Noroko finally finding peace and moving on, Animus using the Heart's power to kill himself, Ananzi being murdered by her own father, and the Shar-Makai annihilated en masse, Peketo is the only playable character still alive. And even then he's now a Sealed Evil in a Duel.
-   _Blood Knights_ has a Downer Beginning where your entire unit gets killed by vampires after being double-crossed by the church, save for your player protagonist, the Vampire Hunter Jeremy. He then forms an uneasy Enemy Mine alliance with a vampire, Alysa, kickstarting the game's events.
-   _Call of Duty: Modern Warfare_: Price is the only named character who survives the entire trilogy.
-   In _Call of Juarez: The Cartel_, DEA agent Eddie Guerra is the sole survivor of the bombing incident of the DEA office. Also upon catching up to Alvarez in the final chapter, depending on who you are playing as, if you choose the option of killing your teammates, you will end up as the sole survivor.
-   _Clock Tower_: The first game gives you the option to save one of three friends, but the sequel makes it canon that Jennifer was the only survivor. And then it reveals that she's not _quite_ the only survivor — Dan Barrows escaped from his burning outer shell and is now the Scissorman.
-   At the beginning of _Crysis 2_, protagonist Alcatraz was the sole survivor of the United States Marine Corps Force Recon unit when the Ceph attacked the submarine that his unit is on. Later subverted when Chino, one of Alcatraz's squadmates, turns up alive... and even later played straight for Chino when Prophet's consciousness takes over Alcatraz's body.
-   _Dead Space_: Isaac Clarke is not only the Sole Survivor of the maintenance crew sent to the Ishimura, but he is the only character to survive the events of the game.
-   The _Doom_ Marine is the sole survivor of his unit. Unless you play Co-Op. In _Doom (2016)_, the Doomguy is revealed to have been the sole survivor of the realm of Argent D'Nur after it was absorbed by Hell. And he is angry as _fuck_ about it.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, in the Human Noble Origin, the player character is the only member of the Cousland noble family and household to survive the massacre at their family's castle in the middle of the night. Companion Wynne even invokes the trope, calling them "the last of the Couslands." (The character's older brother, who wasn't home for the event, has also survived; however, he's missing for most of the game and suspected to be dead. His survival isn't revealed until the end.) Similarly, Alistair is revealed to be the last surviving blood member of the Fereldan royal family.
    -   Depending on the player's dialogue choice at the end of one quest in _Dragon Age II_, Merrill can end up being the only surviving member of her Dalish clan. Meanwhile, depending on the fates of their younger brother and sister, Hawke can end the game as the last surviving member of the Hawke family.
    -   The entire premise of _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ hinges on the fact that the player character is the only one to survive an explosion at the Divine's Conclave, a magic blast which decimated an entire building and killed the other hundreds of people inside it. The game revolves around finding out who is really responsible for the event and why, and preventing them from achieving their ultimate goal. Also, depending on player choices both in this game and the previous one, it's possible for one of the quests to be concluded in such a way that either Bethany or Carver becomes the last surviving member of the Hawke family.
-   A couple of characters in _Evolve_ have this label.
    -   Maggie was the only person to survive the fall of Factor to the monsters, forced to live in the ruins of the colony and hide from the monsters for two years until she could get an evacuation ship up and running on her own.
    -   Markov was a simple colonist until corporate mercenaries raided his home to wipe out the colonists and allow the Megacorps to take over the resources they'd discovered. This one was a bit more notable than the others because he was the sole survivor of the event in general, not just of the colonists.
    -   Slim joined up with the war effort with his friends but ended up as the only one of them to make it out alive after their first real military action.
-   In _Fallout 4_, the player character is the only remaining resident of Vault 111, who woke up after 210 years to find everyone else (including his/her spouse) dead, and in the end, he/she is also the sole survivor of the family after Shaun's death. In fact, the player character is actually referred to by the trope name in official material, due to the fact that they have to name the protagonist _something_, despite the game's near-infinite naming possibilities.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Also, the canon default names for the player in 4 are Nate and Nora for the husband and wife, and it's just easier to refer them as a collective "Sole Survivor".
-   _Fatal Frame_:
    -   Miku from the first game and Mio from the second. They end up lured into the Kuze Manor and cursed due to their Survivor's Guilt.
    -   Yae, one of the ghosts from the first game, is re-introduced in the second game as the twin sister of Sae. It turns out Yae is the only survivor of the Repentance that destroyed her native Minakami Village due to her being Late to the Tragedy.
    -   The third game is itself built on this premise: many a lone survivor suffers from Survivor's Guilt, making them a target of the Tattoo Curse that would eventually kill them when they venture too deep into the dream manor in the hopes of seeing their deceased loved ones. And from the selfsame game, Reika became the sole survivor after an avalanche destroyed her native village and everyone else in it before she was taken into the Kuze family to become the next Tattooed Priestess.
    -   Some characters in the fifth game are this trope as well. Yuuri, one of the playable characters of the game, is the only person to have survived a car accident that claimed her family, and Ouse became a shrine maiden in Mt. Hikami after a flood took out everyone else in her native village.
-   _Final Fantasy_
    -   In _Final Fantasy II_, the Dragoons of Deist are believed to have been wiped out...then you meet Ricard Highwind, the last Dragoon. Even though he makes an Heroic Sacrifice, Elena and Kain vow to restore Deist and the Dragoons in the end.
    -   In _Final Fantasy Dimensions_, Sarah is the lone survivor of Burtgang's royal family because the king sent her away in anticipation of The Empire's final assault on the castle. Nacht is similarly the only survivor from the whole kingdom of Falgabard. Late in the game, the former Imperial general Vata reveals that he joined the empire's military so he could get revenge from within after they destroyed _his_ hometown.
-   In _Find the Cure!_, the player character's backstory states they were the only member of their search party who was able to jump through a Cool Gate and reach another dimension. It wasn't stated whether the others were killed mid-route or simply didn't jump in fast enough. The player can also invoke this by choosing to stay in the other dimension since everyone else from the original Earth will be dead within 25 years.
-   Word of God for _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_ states that as sparing Claude on the Crimson Flower Route is considered the canon option and that he actually escaped unscathed on the Silver Snow route, he is the only faction leader to survive all four routes in the game, especially if Rhea dies at the end of Silver Snow and Verdant Wind routes alongside Edelgard and Dimitri.
    -   Assuming no other students are recruited, Annette has a strong chance of becoming this for the Blue Lions on routes outside of Azure Moon. On the Crimson Flower route, Dimitri, Dedue, Felix, Ingrid, Sylvain, and Mercedes are required kills, while Ashe starts very close to the player's starting position; Annette, meanwhile, is also an optional target but starts far away. On the Verdant Wind route, Ashe can be killed at Aileil, while everybody else sans Dedue can be killed at Gronder, and even then, he can die at Enbarr. Finally, on Silver Snow, Ashe can once again be killed at Aileil, Dedue can once again be killed at Enbarr, and everybody else presumably dies offscreen at Gronder. In all cases, Annette is not seen, implying she survived
-   In _Fredbear and Friends_, Thomas very quickly becomes the only person left alive in the pizzeria, and the only one to successfully escape.
-   In _Genshin Impact_, out of the original Seven Archons, only Morax and Barbatos remains. The others had died and took on their mantle. Morax's character story also mentions that the original Seven Archons once held an oath to guide and protect humanity, but the successors do not necessarily care about said oath.
-   In _Guild Wars 2_, a distressingly common way for Charr to become gladium, usually either by being badass enough to survive the Suicide Mission, or by becoming a Dangerous Deserter when confronted with something so risky. The player characters don't quite hit this mark, as their sparring partner and only their sparring partner survives the game's intro, but players can recruit gladium of the first type and talk gladium of the second.
-   _Halo_:
    -   In _Halo: Reach_, exactly one member of NOBLE Team manages not to die by the end of the game. It's Jun.
    -   It was originally claimed that the Master Chief was the last Spartan-II by the time of _Halo: Combat Evolved_. Then this trope got inverted as more Spartan-IIs were revealed to have survived (or not even been present during) the Fall of Reach.
    -   Similarly, by the end of _Halo: Combat Evolved_, Master Chief appears to be the only person to have survived the events of the game (plus Cortana, but she's an AI living inside his helmet). Him sitting alone on the ship makes an unsettling contrast to the first level where he's surrounded by one army and fighting another army. Later expanded universe materials would reveal other people survived too.
-   _Infested_: You're the only member of 5-A who survives the infestation.
-   If you choose to retrieve the canister instead of saving Jess, and fail to let Gerry get on the boat, Jess will be the sole survivor in _Jurassic Park: The Game_. However, this counts as a Game Over since the game needs the player to fulfill all button inputs, and the final episode is named "The Survivors" for a reason.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_
    -   _Kingdom Hearts χ_ ends with the Protagonist being the last fighter standing at the end of the Keyblade War, only surviving because Ephemer and Skuld intervene and rescue them, allowing them to witness the postbellum events of _Union X\[Cross\]_, but for the player to witness more by extension due to Meanwhile Scenes.
    -   _Kingdom Hearts III_ pads out the final confrontation with the party initially failing to defeat the Demon Tide after Donald Zettaflares Terra-Xehanort. As a result, only Sora and Jiminy are left to undo the problem after the former returns from The Final World, and since the latter can't fight, It's Up To Sora to take down the Lich and rescue his fallen comrades.
-   _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_ gives us Visas Marr, who, for unexplained reasons, is the only survivor of the planet Katarr after the life of the planet itself and everyone on it was drained by Darth Nihilus.
-   O. Dio, the boss of the Western chapter of _Live A Live_, is said to be the only survivor of the 7th Cavalry (Custer's unit); several people remark that they thought nobody survived that. When you defeat him, he turns into a horse—in real life, a horse _was_ the only survivor of the 7th Cavalry—and gallops away. The sheriff theorizes that the hate of the dead soldiers had possessed it.
-   At the start of _Mace Griffin: Bounty Hunter_, Mace's squad of Rangers is wiped out and he is sent to prison. When he gets out ten Years later, the entire organization has been dissolved.
-   _Mari and the Black Tower_: Downplayed. Abbie is seemingly the only survivor of the Bad Future where miasma wiped out humanity, since the last two scientists sent them back in time. Later, it turns out Ned was also sent back in time, and that he's the son of the scientist, Mary.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   This is one of 3 possible backgrounds you can pick for your character in the series — being the Sole Survivor of a team of marines who got wiped out by Thresher Maws (who are 'bout as nasty as they sound). Can lead to an interesting scene later in the original entry, when you run across another survivor, who had been hunting down a group of scientists responsible for setting up the attack, in order to study the Thresher Maws. If you fail to 'talk him down', he'll execute the last of the scientists, and then say "The vids say that you're the only survivor...who am I to argue?" and then shoot himself. Very dramatic.
    -   Although not named explicitly, the Colonist background also has Shepard as the sole survivor of a batarian slave raid that kills his or her entire family. It's possible to combine this with the Sole Survivor background, creating a Shepard whose pre-Spectre life probably qualifies as cursed.
    -   In _Mass Effect 2_, if you do _everything_ wrong, Joker will be the sole survivor of the suicide mission.
    -   If you delay starting the suicide mission for too long, then Dr. Chakwas is the only one of the abducted crew who isn't liquefied.
    -   Played for Laughs with mercenary squadmate Zaeed Massani. Talk to him on the Normandy and he'll share some of his many war stories. Practically all of them end with the mission going FUBAR and him being the only one to make it out, getting to keep his dead comrades' pay in the process. His dossier in the Shadow Broker DLC attributes this partly to the fact that he was a Bad Boss who threw allies into the fire to save his own hide. This is a hint that he's actually a poor choice for a Squad Leader in the end game.
    -   Eve is the only krogan female to survive Maelon's experiments and the side effects - unless you didn't save his data, in which case she will die.
    -   In _Mass Effect: Andromeda_, depending on player choice, Salarian Pathfinder Zevin Raeka can be the only original pathfinder to survive the game.
-   You gotta admit that Artyom in _Metro 2033_ is the luckiest SOB in the game to survive multiple near-death situations. Most who accompanied him on the mission are either dead or badly wounded.
-   _Metroid_
    -   Samus Aran is the only survivor of a Space Pirate raid on her colony. Then the Chozo that rescued her were wiped out and/or disappeared, making her a Sole Survivor twice over.
    -   _Metroid: Other M_ reveals that the sole survivor of the Space Pirates on Zebes that wasn't cloned/recreated like Ridley and Mother Brain was actually Phantoon, who is finally killed in the epilogue. Hopefully.
-   In the "Rise and Shine" short, it's revealed that Mei of _Overwatch_ is the only living employee of the former Ecopoint: Antarctica. An ice storm damaged their power supply; with dwindling supplies, all six of them went into cryosleep until they could be rescued. However, all the pods except Mei's malfunctioned, causing them all to die.
-   The survivor of the peace mission in _Quest for Glory III_, who dies soon after returning to Tarna after suffering terrible wounds.
-   In _Ravensword: Shadowlands_, the game has you play as the only survivor of a battle between dark elves and humans, where everyone died as a result of a powerful demon named Ul'Thok being summoned.
-   Hunk in _Resident Evil 2_ is the only survivor of the Umbrella cleanup team. His ending portrait in _Resident Evil 3: Nemesis_ reveals that he's earned a reputation for _always_ being the only member of his team to survive, to the point that other Umbrella employees have nicknamed him "Mr. Death".
    -   In _Resident Evil 6_, Chris is the only survivor of his team thanks to Piers' heroic sacrifice.
-   The very first message you receive in _Rodina_ on your Pilot Wave Radio informs you that you are the only survivor of a ship that was attacked when entering the system the game takes place in.
-   _Rule of Rose_: Wendy sics Gregory Wilson on the orphans, before being killed by him herself. Wilson attacks Jennifer too, but eventually commits suicide. Jennifer is the only one who escapes this.
-   _SaGa Frontier_: The region of Wakatu was wiped out by Trinity. Gen is the only survivor of the region, and has taken to drinking himself into a stupor over his loss. His status as the last survivor allows for Loophole Abuse; Trinity has banned any travel to Wakatu (which you need to enter for the Tarot Quest) unless you are accompanied by a native, because they didn't think there _were_ any survivors.
-   Completely screw up with the time limits in _Splatterhouse 3_, and Rick will be the only member of the Taylor family to survive the night.
-   Two women from _Super Robot Wars_ fell to this trope: Selena Recital was the sole survivor of Team Jelba from a Balmarian assault, while Calvina Coulange was the sole survivor from the Ashalley Kreutzer facility when the said facility was decimated by the Furies. And no, they're not Expies.
-   Kirby is the only fighter to survive the Downer Beginning of _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_'s _World of Light_ Adventure mode.
-   _Trillion: God of Destruction_: Archangel Uriel is the only survivor of Trillion's onslaught against Heaven.
-   _Until Dawn_'s Anyone Can Die mechanics make this a possibility for almost every playable character, even if it means turning into a wendigo. The sole exception is Mike, who will pull a Taking You with Me if he believes he's the last one.
-   The _Valkyria Chronicles_ series is fond of this trope:
    -   Jamil of _Valkyria Chronicles II_ is both the sole survivor of his squad and the sole survivor of his hometown (because it was razed while he was away with the army trying to protect it). Understandably, he has a lot of survivor's guilt and views himself as The Jinx.
    -   Reila "Number 13" from _Valkyria Chronicles III_ is the sole survivor of _multiple squads_, causing her to be viewed as The Jinx by the regular army. This becomes Fridge Brilliance when you realize she survived when others didn't because she is unknowingly a Valkyria, a race with supernaturally fast and effective healing powers.
    -   _Valkyria Chronicles 4_: Vincey Fiore was part of an elite special forces unit of The Federation, until her unit was massacred except for her, which made her into a Shell-Shocked Veteran Lady Drunk. In Gameplay and Story Integration, the backstory explains why Vincey's The Load in-game with her negative potentials, but her experience also explains why Character Development from her squad story mission can give her Magikarp Power into one of the most powerful shock troopers of The Squad.
-   _A Very Long Rope to the Top of the Sky_: Brooke was the only survivor after "her family was slaughtered", as a man in Balfur City will explain after she's meetable after the Bandit King took over.
-   In _World of Warcraft_, there used to be a series of quests that would lead you to acquire your Dungeon Set 2. It involved the Veiled Blade mercenary company, who had been cursed when they grabbed the amulet of the dragon they had just killed, Lord Valthalak. One by one, they were killed by Valthalak's spectral assassin, until only two remained: Deliana and Mokvar, who had fled seeking protection in Ironforge and Orgrimmar respectively. They each tried to escape the curse, eventually succeeding with the Adventurer's help. Mokvar eventually earned a place in Garrosh's Horde, where he was killed during the Siege of Orgrimmar, leaving Deliana as the sole surviving member of the Veiled Blade.
-   If you play the tutorial for _XCOM: Enemy Unknown_, the only survivor of Operation Devil's Moon will be Delta 2, AKA the "Argentine Heavy" (his name and later callsign are randomized, but he will always be an Argentinean who promotes into the Heavy class). This Mauve Shirt tends to become the backbone of a new player's roster, but he's just as mortal as the Rookies he'll be serving with.
-   _XCOM 2_ similarly has Jane Kelly, who survives the tutorial version of Operation Gatecrasher and becomes XCOM's first promoted soldier. Technically she's not the _only_ survivor, since Central Officer Bradford also takes to the field and by the end of the mission they've rescued the Commander, but afterwards Bradford goes back to serving as Mission Control while the Commander leads from the _Avenger_, so Kelly's the only field operative to survive the mission.

    Visual Novels 

-   During the final trial of _Dangan Ronpa Trigger Happy Havoc,_ after the Big Bad, Junko Enoshima, has revealed herself and told the rest of the students that they were given amnesia to forget the fact that they all were friends for two years to Hope's Peak and holed up inside the school to protect themselves against the apocalypse, she decides to give Togami a very heavy dose of Break the Haughty. She plainly tells him that during The Tragedy, _every single member of his family died horribly,_ and he is now the only one left. He was born and bred to inherit his family's company and had to become extremely cutthroat to beat all his half-siblings and rise to the top, and he's now faced with the reality that all of it was for nothing. Togami's been a total Smug Snake up until now (albeit slightly more team-oriented at this point than in the beginning) but despite his self-centered, pompus attitude, it's still hard to watch him become so visibly distressed in the face of such horrible news.
-   Both the protagonist and Tamara in _Double Homework_, since they were the only survivors of the avalanche they started.
    
    **Tamara:** Only the strongest skiers survived Barbarossa that day.
    
    **Protagonist:** Only us.
    
-   Shirou Emiya in _Fate/stay night_ was the sole survivor of a great fire ten years ago that razed a whole section of the town he lives in and killed almost everyone else living there. A few other kids are mentioned to have gotten out, but they've all moved away to different foster families and Shirou has no contact with anyone else who was directly involved in the disaster. It has left him with a fair bit of Survivor's Guilt, and all three routes are dedicated to how he deals with it in different ways. In the Fate route, you eventually get some of the background to the event: Kotomine caused the event by wishing for a distraction from the incomplete Grail, and all the other surviving kids were taken in by the church and converted into living mana batteries for Gilgamesh.
-   _The Fruit of Grisaia_: Amane is the only survivor of an accident in which her school bus drove off a cliff and crashed in a ravine, stranding the survivors for weeks. Starvation and disease slowly killed several of her classmates, leading the rest of the survivors to resort to cannibalism, but Amane ultimately managed to escape and was eventually rescued. This leads to Amane developing a serious case of Survivor Guilt.
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_
    -   At the end of the _Tatarigoroshi-hen_ chapter, Keiichi is pushed off a bridge by Satoko (who, after finding him over Rika's corpse, believed he did it), and curses the town to die as he falls. Next morning, he stumbles back into town to find that everyone died of volcanic gases.
    -   Satoko (as if she wasn't broken enough) gets this treatment in (the anime only) _Yakusamashi-hen_, when she finds Rika's mutilated corpse _again_, falls off a bridge after a lengthy chase (the very same one she pushed Keiichi from) and stumbles back into town several hours later. For bonus points, Satoko becomes a Comatose Canary after this ordeal.
    -   Mion also deserves a mention, due to the fact that the above Satoko example was based on a game-only arc centered on her, Comatose Canary ending and all.
    -   Rika gets an ending where she is the sole survivor, which is the arc where she takes the school hostage and is arrested and taken out of town before the Great Hinamizawa Disaster. She spends her adult years as a Broken Bird, flipping back and forth between quiet and indrawn, to screaming and rambling in fear and horror at the drop of a hat.
    -   In the first episode of _Kai_ it's revealed Rena was the only survivor of _Tsumihoroboshi-hen_. After attempting to bomb the school she was taken into police custody and thus wasn't in Hinamizawa when the gassing happened.
-   This is practically a running theme in _Sunrider_:
    -   The titular ship is the only vessel of the Cera Space Force to escape from the PACT invasion, with the rest being sunk by the Legion’s opening salvo.
    -   Chigara Ashada is the only survivor of the Diode Catastrophe, in which her home planet was swallowed up by an artificial black hole.
    -   Icari Isidolde was the only survivor of a PACT attack on her family’s spaceship.
    -   Sola di Ryuvia is the only survivor of a battle fought 2,000 years ago, and the last surviving citizen of the ancient Ryuvian Empire.
-   Another Nasuverse example, Tohno Shiki, from _Tsukihime_, is the sole survivor of the Nanaya demon-hunting clan. Not counting his TATARI clones.

    -   Robina van Lanschot was among the 249 passengers and crew onboard KLM Flight 4805 when it was diverted to Tenerife after a terrorist attack shut down their destination airport. Van Lanschot, who lived on Tenerife, chose to disregard airline and airport rules and did not re-board the plane when they were cleared for departure, electing instead to stay on Tenerife so she could see her boyfriend.

-   Harrison Okene, a 29-year-old cook, was the sole survivor of a tugboat that capsized just off the coast of Nigeria during a heavy swell. A hundred feet below the surface, in complete darkness, Harrison survived as he crouched inside a 4 square foot air pocket. More than sixty hours later, he got the attention of a team of divers who had arrived to recover the crew's bodies. After two days in a decompression chamber, Harrison returned to land. It's worth mentioning that he was on the toilet as the boat capsized. This man survived two and a half days under the Atlantic, chest-deep in freezing water, in nothing but his underwear, with only a single bottle of coca cola for food or hydration.
-   Four people were in the car crash that killed Princess Diana; bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was the only one to survive.

After an extended delay in sending rescue vessels, there was only one survivor, 19-year-old David Stoliar.

-   Ben Cauley was the only survivor of the plane crash that killed soul legend Otis Redding and most of Cauley's bandmates, the original Bar-Kays. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   The wreck of the "White Ship" killed all those aboard (including the heir to the throne of England, William Aetheling) bar one, a butcher named Berold. While William escaped with several others to a lifeboat, he decided to go back and rescue his half-sister; unfortunately, the lifeboat was swarmed and capsized. William's death led to a nineteen-year conflict over the succession.
-   Charlotte Brontë witnessed the deaths of all five of her siblings to tuberculosis. Her last novel, _Villette_, reflects the sadness that this brought her.
