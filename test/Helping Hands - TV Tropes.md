He just can't handle the kickflip.

Did you just chop apart the evil zombie or robot you were fighting? Keep an eye on all the parts, because it's only a matter of time before that severed hand starts to spider-crawl after you, or scuttle off for some nefarious purpose.

With zombies and similar creatures, the ability for the hand to function independently is often a result of some sort of supernatural energy. With robots, it's usually a result of Easily Detachable Robot Parts.

See Evil Hand for when this happens _before_ it gets lopped off. When its deliberately done during a fight, it's an example of Detachment Combat.

For other lopped off yet functional body parts see: Losing Your Head, Organ Autonomy, Brain in a Jar and Animate Body Parts.

Not to be confused with Handy Helper.

## Robots

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Doraemon_ have a gadget called the Spray-on Hands (most likely made of nanobots), that when applied on its user's hands, manifests as a pair of disembodied, floating hands that carries out whatever given tasks. Nobita uses this gadget to slack off as his floating hands does his homework for him, only for the gadget to (what else?) backfire hilariously - forgetting Doraemon's advice to re-apply the spray once the task is complete, Nobita, waking up from a nap, finds out his floating hands have scribbled a _hole_ in his maths book.
-   The Junji Ito horror manga, _Gyo_ have Tadashi's Mad Scientist uncle cutting off an arm after it's attached to a compact-sized walking machine. Said arm somehow assimilates with the machine itself and gains a life of it's own, scaring the bejesus out of Kaori (at the sight of a severed human hand on robotic legs) later on.
-   _Mazinger Z_:
    -   Several Mechanical Monsters — such like Deimos F3 and Briver A3 — could detach their hands from themselves and attacking with them, or simply picking or holding their enemies.
    -   The titular Humongous Mecha is an heroic example: During his first battle in the manga Doublas M2 coils one of its necks around one of its forearms and rips it off... and then the wrenched arm flies on its own and punches through Doublas M2. This scene is replied in the first opening. Kouji often also uses Mazinger's fists to pick things or people.
-   Sirene in _Devilman_ can detach her arms and control them independently of the rest of her body with psychic abilities. The 1990 OVA takes this up a notch by having the detached arm capable of rotating at such high speed that it can become a Deadly Disc while in flight.
-   The Zeong mobile suit from, well, _Mobile Suit Gundam_ can disconnect its arms at the elbow (they're connected by wires, but very long ones) in order to attack with its beam cannon fingers from any angle. For example, it could disconnect an arm and circle around a GM in order to shoot it in the back, bypassing its shield, but this isn't very necessary given its incredible power. This ability was built into the suit in order to let pilot Char Aznable make use of his telepathy to guide the arms and attack from unpredictable angles. There are several mobile suits in Gundam that use this ability, such as the Hamma Hamma and Turn X.

    Films — Animation 

-   All parts of _The Iron Giant_ can move on their own, for self-repair purposes. This was also in the original book.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The detached hand of B-4 grabs at Worf's ankle in _Star Trek: Nemesis_.
-   _Iron Man 3_ has an impressive scene where Jarvis detaches a modular armor's forearm to help Tony without any prompting as he was too busy drowning at the time.

    Literature 

-   _Family Skeleton Mysteries_: After learning how to control his other bones from a distance (Sid's consciousness is based out of his skull), Sid uses one hand to write notes to Georgia, leading her to where his skull is.
-   _The Iron Man_: The eponymous giant is shattered into pieces falling off a cliff in the opening page of the book. A single hand animates, picks up an eye and starts piecing the rest of the iron man back together.
-   _Piano Lessons Can Be Murder_ have the kid protagonist, Jerry, finding out his school to be haunted by ghostly, severed hands of the past students (as shown on the book's cover). But in The Reveal late into the story, those hands turns out to be robotic, belonging to the school's best students in the past who ends up being murdered by the janitor - a Serial Killer obsessed with music - who then collects and convert their hands into piano-playing automatons because "music sounds better without human error". Yikes!
-   _The Murderbot Diaries_. In _Network Effect_ the title character, a cyborg, finds itself suspended upside-down over a pit with its arms taunt so it can't break free. Murderbot detaches a hand which involves individually disconnecting circuits and tearing loose some flesh and nerves (fortunately it can dial down its pain sensors), then walking the hand by the fingers up onto the arm, which is then torn free of its cuff whereupon the hand is reattached. Murderbot is then easily able to break the other cuffs. The main risk involved dropping its hand during all this, which would have left Murderbot screwed.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Red Dwarf_:
    -   After suffering critical damage, Kryten uses one of his hands, an eye, and assorted other parts to build a miniature robot for the express purpose of getting help. And then the miniature robot starts running around in Lister's "joy department".

    Webcomics 

    Web Videos 

-   In _Atop the Fourth Wall_, Mechakara's hand has to contain a stupendous amount of technology for Lord Vyse's escape plan to work — technology that does not seem to serve much purpose being installed in a _hand_. Of course, as it turns out, this is exactly what he needs, so...

    Western Animation 

-   _Monster Beach_: In one episode, Widget's hand leaves her arm and starts to make trouble to her friends.

-   _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_: XR has to do this as part of his Chew Toy job on occasion.

-   In the anime _Vampire Hunter D_, we have the title vampire hunter's left hand, which has somehow gotten a Demon embedded in it. Said demon is shown by having a _face_ in the palm of the hand, including eyes, nose, and mouth. After being severed in a rather gory scene that includes D being staked through the heart, the hand crawls back to D's body, reattaches itself to D's arm, _pulls out the stake_, then attempts to revive D by a) eating earth for energy (with accompanying belch afterward), b) sucking wind to give him breath, then pounding on his chest to restart his heart. All this while a monster approaches that would be the Final Death for D. Naturally, he wakes up in time to kill the monster and progress through the story. Of course, all this is helped by the titular D being a _dhampir_, a half-human half-vampire hybrid.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Comic Books

He says he wishes he had his friends brains, which the paw essentially grants by brute forcing a brain transplant.

-   They weren't detached from anyone... probably, but the Trope Namers are the "Helping Hands" of _Labyrinth_, which are fairly creepy and actually do seem to mean well but are very Literal-Minded. They _were_ trying to help, not their fault "she chose _down_."

    Folklore 

-   In Brazilian Folklore, the Little Black Hand / Mãozinha Preta is a haunting from the Southeast region with the appearance of a disembodied black hand that could harm wanderers at night. Some versions, however, say the hand could be pretty helpful as well when summoned, obeying orders and doing domestic chores. However, the hand would never harm slaves: one story tells about a slaveowner who ordered it to punish a woman slave, only for the hand to rebel against its master in fury, hence why it is also called Little Hand of Justice.

    Gamebooks 

-   _Fighting Fantasy_
    -   In the first book, _The Warlock of Firetop Mountain_, you will come across a room full of tiles in the shape of hands, or stars. If you stepped on a hand tile, you'll be attacked by dozens and dozens of ghostly hands materializing out of those tiles, which you must destroy in order to reach the other end. The star-tiles on the other hand are harmless.
    -   _Beneath Nightmare Castle_ have a really horrifying example, where the player, after defeating a bunch of soldiers, can choose to open a chest they're carrying or simply abandon it. Choose the former and it turns out the chest is filled with _severed limbs_, who then comes to life crawling out to attack, and must be hacked to pieces. Choose the latter option and the book actually _rewards_ the player by increasing his Sanity Meter, saying he felt "an overwhelming sense of relief, for some reason, after leaving the mysterious chest".
-   _Lone Wolf_:
    -   From the book _Castle Death_, the Rahkos is a floating, undead hand fond of eating brains. Unfortunately for Lone Wolf, he's confronted to it in a No-Gear Level, and it's rather hard to put down for good without a magic weapon.

When finally subdued, it demonstrates the ability to point to the locations of its other body parts like a compass, kickstarting the overarching scavenger hunt/murder mystery of the novel.
-   In the 1838 penny dreadful _Hugues, the Wer-Wolf_, a butcher who'd chopped the werewolf's hand off tries to get rid of the severed part by burying it or dropping it down a well, but it keeps turning up again at his home, as if it's crawling back when he's not watching. A subversion, as it's strongly implied that his daughter is secretly retrieving it and planting it in her father's house, to punish him for maiming the werewolf with whom she's in love.
-   In _The Iron Man_ by Ted Hughes, published as _The Iron Giant_ in the United States and very loosely adapted into the film of the same name, the title character arrives on Earth as a large collection of disassembled bits that then have to assemble themselves. The book example probably belongs here rather than in the Robots folder, as the titular Iron Man behaves more like a _kaiju_ than a Humongous Mecha.
-   In _Masques_, Aralorn has to get rid of an undead arm by crossing running water, and she mentions that taking the arm with her might result in the undead reassembling itself wherever the arm is.
-   Necromancers who stay alive way too long in _Nightrunner_ turn into Dyrmagnos, beings with withered corpse bodies. If you cut them up without separating the body parts, they will rejoin. The wizards' museum has a pair of hands from an infamous Dyrmagnos which still move after hundreds of years.

-   In _So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish_, the Old Pink Dog Bar is home to the disembodied hand of its former owner, who bequeathed it to medical science on his deathbed; medical science didn't like the look of it and bequeathed it back to the bar. It is characterised by a fierce loyalty to the bar and an eagerness to employ extreme violence against anyone who breaks the rules, such as asking for credit. The current barman doesn't believe in the supernatural, but he knows a useful ally when he sees one.
-   The severed hand of an executed sorcerer seeks vengeance on the man who betrayed him in the _Solomon Kane_ short story "The Right Hand of Doom".
-   The wights in _A Song of Ice and Fire_ have limbs that continue to move about and attack even after dismemberment.
-   Patchwork, a.k.a. Modular Woman, from the _Wild Cards_ novels, can tear off her body parts and use them remotely. She had people plant her eyes and ear (she needed the other ear to communicate with others) where they could spy on her boss's enemies.

    Live-Action TV

-   The _Angel_ episode "I Fall to Pieces" has a surgeon who can detach parts of himself to aid in stalking/molesting his victims.
-   _Wizards of Waverly Place_. The episode that plays with this trope is even called "Helping Hand"! Although it isn't very helpful after Alex uses it to clean up the shop, then doesn't give it a break or reward it in any way.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Buffy herself once had to sell a detached mummy hand to a picky customer. It didn't go so well.
-   _Good Eats_ lampshades Thing from _The Addams Family_. The Thing in _Good Eats_ is canonically the grandson of the one from _The Addams Family_.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The infamous "Hand of Sutekh" from the episode "Pyramids of Mars". While this is only really a stagehand's hand holding down Sutekh's cushion when he first stands up, it has become an in-joke among _Doctor Who_ fans.
    -   Played straight for a spell in the classic story "The Hand of Fear".
    -   A living plastic mannequin's arm in the first episode of the new series, "Rose", tries to strangle the Ninth Doctor.
    -   "The Haunting of Villa Diodati": Lord Byron has, for very Byronic reasons, brought a 15th-century sailor's skeleton to the party in a chest.

    **Gomez Addams:** That's the spirit, Thing! Lend a hand!

    -   In 3.5, Warlocks have an invocation that severs their _own_ hand, which animates and crawls around like a spider, to be used as a sort of scout. They can also do this with an _eye_. Don't worry, the limbs come back.
    -   Lebendtod of Ravenloft can remove their hands, heads, or whole limbs in a similar manner.
    -   "Bigby's Many Hands" line of spells, which summon the disembodied hands of, presumably, the Wizard Bigby, which do various "things" depending on the spell. Similar spells are _mage's hand_, which is for non-combat purposes, the _spectral hand_, and others, including one even called _helping hand_.
    -   The _Book of Vile Darkness_ has the _grim revenge_ spell, used by undead caster, to sever (painfully) the hand of a living victim, and then animate it as an undead monstrosity bent on draining the lifeforce of its previous owner.
    -   Also from _Book of Vile Darkness_, the spell _Graz'zt's long grasp_ detaches the hand of the caster and sends it flying around. It can flank or grapple, though its main interest is to transmit touch spells, making it a superior (but riskier) version of _spectral hand_.
    -   Forgotten Realms adds a lot of variations, such as _Alcimer's flying fist_ or _Daltim's flaming fist_ (the signature spell of a Halruaan mercenary pyromancer: the same general idea, but on fire) and a few grasping and/or attacking claw variants, such as _Caligarde's claw_ and _Manshoon's xorn talons_. There are also more tricky and obscure spells like _Halaster's grappling hand_ (door-sized force hand selectively intercepting magical attacks and creatures with magic items, but passing through non-magical matter) or _Duhlark's long reach_ (large arm remotely formed from any present material that can grab, smash or pull _and_ conducts spells like Spectral Hand).
    -   Crawling claws, a mindless, weak, but usually swarming monster originally from Forgotten Realms — an animated severed hand in any shape from fresh to skeletal. It doesn't count as a proper undead, just a construct, thus is not turnable and even good wizards sometimes make one or two dozens. Mostly used as a guardian, but there's a more useful flying variety which can grasp and move at once, so those who can make them get hovering test-tube holders and suchlike. The vampiric variant, though, is much nastier.
    -   In _CD&D_, a powerful form of undead known as the druj exists, which takes the form of animated body parts: either eyes, skulls, or this trope.
-   The advantage Independent Body Parts from _GURPS: Powers_.
-   In _Munchkin_, the Crawling Hand is an Undead monster; it can be fought normally, or, if you give it an item, it becomes your pet crawling hand and gives you a combat bonus.
-   In some scenarios of _Mansions of Madness_ dead bodies spawn 2 autonomous hands under GM's control. These buggers are more annoying than all the zombies and demons combined.

-   _Phelios_ has a really creepy area where your character gets attacked by floating, severed blue limbs (ripped at the elbow) who tries grabbing you.
-   Master Hand and Crazy Hand from _Super Smash Bros._ are giant, disembodied, floating, gloved hands.
-   The Choking Hands from the _Blood_ series. They're the only "clingy" enemy in the whole game, and the "use" key has to be mashed to toss them off<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . They're extremely weak to compensate for their irritating attack strategy and speed easily capable of keeping up with Caleb. They return in _Blood II: The Chosen_, and when they see the player, they'll stand on the wrist stump and give them the ol' one-finger salute before going after them.
    
    ''"I'll swallow your soul!"
    
-   One of these is available as a non-combat pet in _World of Warcraft_.
-   Guybrush's left hand gains a mind of its own when it's infected by the Pox of LeChuck in _Tales of Monkey Island_, and acts on its own whether or not it's attached to Guybrush's arm.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   The Floormaster and Wallmaster enemy types in games resemble gigantic disembodied monster hands.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_ has Zant's hands in the Palace of Twilight. Each hand holds one of the Sols that Link has to steal. When the Sol is removed from one of them it will come to life and try to take it back.
    -   Several games have an undead hand that lives in a toilet and asks Link for paper for unexplained reasons. The one that appears in _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_ is revealed to be named Phoeni in a guide, but it is unclear if the ones who appeared in previous (though chronologically later) games are the same character or not.
-   _Dead Space_ has this as a major issue with one of its enemies.
-   In Post-2014 _Dwarf Fortress_, severing body parts from the undead renders them inanimate, but necromancers and mummies can easily _re_animate the body parts so long as they have a part capable of grasping (i.e. hands, mouths, pincers). They can even do this to body parts severed from living beings, so adventures can find themselves in the unlucky circumstance of having to fight their own severed arm.
-   Tibia has Hands of Cursed Fate, which are human-sized purple hands. They're one of the strongest enemies from the unnamed Demon dimension and, by extension, in the entire game.
-   In _Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings And The Lost Ocean_ you have the Devilish Hands and their family of monsters. Unusual in that they're two hands, fused together at the bottom of the palm, and they crawl along akin to a Giant Spider.
-   The old Infocom text adventure _The Lurking Horror_ had one, in the form of an amputated human hand you could reanimate. It's actually very helpful to you, and is key for surviving some of the late game challenges, including helping you defeat the Final Boss.
-   _Mystic Defender_ have gigantic draconic hands ending at the stump as an enemy late into the game, as large as your player hero. They attack either by clawing at you or materializing a round, exploding projectile from their palms, which they then drop from above.

-   _Paranatural_: Lefty, the ghost of a left hand. He's one of the most effective combatants in the series.

    **Left:** _\[shows Max his wrist\]_  
    **Max:** Oh my. Them's tendons.  
    **PJ:** One hundred percent flesh and blood, brother! well not really but you know what I mean
    

    Western Animation
