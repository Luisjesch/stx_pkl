A subtrope of Dem Bones, Skeletons are often symbols of death, but in recent years, especially in much of the West, Skeletons have also become a symbol for revelry and good old fashioned spooky fun. Skeletons in fiction will often be portrayed as funny, jolly, and sometimes clever. They will often dress in dapper suits, and may be graceful and agile. Bone and skeleton puns are almost guaranteed, as are scenes of rib cages being used like xylophones or skulls being juggled and tossed about. The skeleton in question will usually either be on the hero's side, be the hero, or at least be a really fun antagonist. Can often be a Skeletal Musician.

This is due, in no small part, because of their association with Halloween and Dia de los Muertos (with Calacas being a related trope/subtrope of this in most depictions that's particularly tied to Mexican culture and heritage), as well as the fact that they always appear to be grinning. Skeletons are associated with death, but that isn't always a bad thing. In many circles and cultures, skeletons and skulls can serve as a reminder to accept and even embrace death, thus the oft sympathetic portrayals of the Grim Reaper. As an extension of their association with death and thus endings, they may sometimes be associated with change. They may be further used to symbolize life after death, or with one's family or ancestry. In a sense, a skull or skeleton can sometimes be a symbol of embracing life. There's also the fact that there is something inherently funny about a skeleton just getting up and walking around.

This trope is especially common in works centering around Halloween, or that have a decidedly Goth aesthetic, so friendly skeletons are especially likely to be found in Halloweentown. They can also be an example of Our Monsters Are Different. Related to Chummy Mummy, Friendly Zombie, Friendly Ghost, Friendly Neighborhood Vampire, and Wonderful Werewolf. If the skeleton is the Grim Reaper, it's also Don't Fear the Reaper. Can often overlap with Stingy Jack.

    Anime & Manga

-   In _Skull-face Bookseller Honda-san_ the creator depicts herself as a skeleton. As a retail worker, she's kind and polite, though maybe not the typical happy skeleton.
-   _Anpanman_: Horrorman the skeleton is extremely friendly and easygoing, and on good terms with most if not all of the other characters. This turns out to be a bit of a problem, though, because he's so personable and chummy that he treats _everyone_ as his best friend and will cheerfully help them with whatever they need help with... even if the person he's helping is, say, a major villain.
-   Death from _Gregory Horror Show_ is an unexpected ally of the guest. He doesn't show up in the hotel proper however.

    Arts 

-   Death and the Maiden was a common motif in Renaissance art, particularly in Germany, that would depict a beautiful young woman with Death himself, usually depicted as a skeleton. While not all depictions show death as a particularly friendly fellow, some depictions show the maiden and death embracing, romantically or sometimes even erotically. This motif was revived in the Romantic Era of art.

    Comedy 

-   Achmed the Dead Terrorist. He tries to talk a big game, but he's as harmless as he is funny, not to mention utterly incompetent as a suicide bomber.

    Comic Books 

-   _Scary Godmother_ features Mr. Skully Pettibone, a flamboyant Skeleton in the Closet who wears a top hat and bowtie. Keeping with the general theme of the series that monsters are nothing to be afraid of, he's of course a delight.
-   _Yorick and Bones_: Yorick is a recently magically resurrected skeleton who is just looking for a friend. Thing is, every time people see him, they scream and run away.

-   _The Last Unicorn_ features a laughing Skeleton who knows the way to the Red Bull and would only exchange this information in exchange for wine, despite not being able to taste or smell it.
-   _Corpse Bride_, of course, features quite a few, including Bonejangles, the Skeletal Musician who tells us the story of our titular Corpse Bride. In song, of course.
-   In _The Book of Life,_ the dead are depicted as walking skeletons with glowing eyes, but all of them retain the experiences they had in life and most of them are nice. Similarly, La Muerte is depicted as a skeleton made of candied bones, but she's sweet, caring, and reasonable.

    Literature 

-   _Unseen Academicals_ has Charley, the good-natured assistant at Unseen University's Department of Necromancy... sorry, _Post-Mortem Communications_.

-   The titular character of _Skulduggery Pleasant_ is usually nice and friendly enough, unless you're foolish enough to earn the ire of a centuries old skeletal sorcerer.
-   Sid of _Family Skeleton Mysteries_, of course.
-   The Big Skeleton, Little Skeleton and the Dog Skeleton from _Funny Bones_ are portrayed as more goofy than frightening. They do aim to scare people, but when it turns out the streets are empty, they choose to scare each other instead. Their intentions to be scary are more related to them being skeletons (and thus supposed to be scary) than out of any malice or ill will.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Halloweentown_ features a skeleton taxi driver named Benny who is nice to the Piper grandkids (until Kalabar takes control of him) and provides them with exposition.

He's also pretty fond of his bosses (his sister Rita and her husband, Zedd)—his Establishing Character Moment is giving them an anniversary gift.
-   The Halloween episode of _Teen Angel_ features an appearance by Ron Glass as a talking paper skeleton.
-   In the "Robert Palins" sketch from _I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson,_ this is the impression one gets of the skeletons that Tim sings about coming to life.

    Music 

-   The song "Spooky Scary Skeletons" by Andrew Gold and all its various remixes has the lines "We're so sorry skeletons/You're so misunderstood/You only want to socialize/But I don't think we should" and "Spooky Scary Skeletons/Are silly all the same" implying that these skeletons aren't actually malicious just....Spooky scary.
-   Joe Iconis's "My Best Friend is a Skeleton" is about a human whose best friend is — you guessed it — a living skeleton. They spend their days cracking skeleton puns and almost never fight with one another.
