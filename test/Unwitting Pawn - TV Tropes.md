_"I was a fool. I had been deceived that I had been working for a greater good. I was in fact an unknowing tool of a greater evil."_

This is the kind of person that the Magnificent Bastard and Batman Gambit depend on. Not only does an Unwitting Pawn fail to stop the bad guy, but he actually furthers the villain's plan in the process. The Manipulative Bastard will take great delight in using them and then deconstructing their naivete and blind faith as they gloat (in which case compare What Have I Done). Not surprisingly, they also have a tendency to die ironically after inadvertently helping the villain. But if they survive... there's bound to be some nasty surprises in store for the Bastards.

These guys are not always being manipulated by the villain; sometimes they blunder their way into helping him of their own accord. Not that the villain's going to examine his gift horse for cavities...

The Wide-Eyed Idealist often becomes this, but sometimes the Knight Templar and Well-Intentioned Extremist can fall into this too. When the main character does this, and then has to _fix_ it, it's Nice Job Breaking It, Hero.

Sometimes the unwitting pawn is deserving of his fate. They may be a Corrupt Corporate Executive, Evil Businessman, or someone else who has achieved great success through questionable means. Sometimes, he owes his success to someone he screwed over. They will often fall victim to blackmail or the reminder of what could happen "if the truth should get out...". Sometimes, the pawn is allowed to remain a figurehead to keep up appearances while his strings are pulled behind the scenes. This often happens to Corrupt Politicians as well who come to realize that they probably had a lot of help to realize their ambitions and get to the top.

Compare Out-Gambitted, Unwitting Instigator of Doom. Contrast the Spanner in the Works, who just as ignorantly harms these schemes.

Tend to be played by The Chessmaster, logically enough. But also the Manipulative Bastard uses them too.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Attack on Titan_, Annie, Reiner, and Bertolt are revealed to have been this all along. As part of Marley's Warrior program, they were raised to believe the people living within the Walls were evil and a threat to the safety of the entire world. Grisha's backstory includes the creation of the modern program, with the Marleyan government announcing that King Fritz had sent a message threatening to use the Wall Titans to destroy the world. However, Grisha is later told by Kruger that there was no such message, because the ruler of the Walls is controlled by the First King's "Will" and cannot act to even defend their people. Marley is actually after the natural resources underneath the Walled territory and wants to exterminate everyone in their way. To this end, they invented the whole "threat" and manipulated children into doing their dirty work. Even worse, Kruger mentions that once Marley has obtained the Founding Titan, they will likely use it to exterminate **all** Eldians, including those serving them. As such, the Warriors were tricked into seeking out the Coordinate not to save their people, but to give Marley the means to carry out a Final Solution.
-   _Berserk_:
    -   Griffith presents himself to the Pope of the Holy Church as God's prophesied messiah, inspiring the old man to essentially serve as his biggest hype machine, further easing his manipulative influence throughout Midland... and all the while remaining blissfully unaware of his true, vile nature.
    -   A lesser example, but nonetheless one that creates long-lasting consequences, is Skull Knight's attempt to kill Griffith with a mystical attack, only for the latter to redirect said attack into accidentally destroying the gate that separates the physical and astral planes in the Berserk-verse. This allows Griffith to unleash hell on earth.
-   _Black Clover_:
    -   Rades Spirito, Valtos and Sally were this to Licht aka Patolli, who hated them for being humans as well as being backstabbing and traitorous, only keeping them around due to their magical prowess and promptly sacrifices them once he had everything he needed.
    -   In a bit of Laser-Guided Karma, Patolli _himself_ as well as the entire vengeful Elf Tribe, to resurrect which Patolli killed the Wizard King and his subordinates for, have been pawns to Zagred, the Devil who _actually_ committed the Elf Massacre, and framed the First Wizard King as well by copying his magic and letting the Elves think the humans betrayed them, all so that Zagred can break Patolli with despair and possess him.
    -   Literally _every single character_ is being played by Lucius Zogratis for him to steal his sibling's magic alongside the king of devils Lucifero's, so he gains god-like powers that allow him to start a holy war that would wipe out humanity and resurrect them as immortal, angelic superhumans, making it so the Kingdom's inequality and social prejudice will no longer exist.
-   Played with in _Bleach_, where Magnificent Bastard Aizen is unable to manipulate Ichigo directly, so it is revealed that instead he manipulates almost EVERYONE ELSE in the story (including everyone Ichigo has fought, as well as Orihime) since before the story started so Ichigo will do what he wants. He has in fact been keeping an eye on Ichigo since his birth due to being the instigator in his parents' meeting.
-   In _A Certain Magical Index_, seemingly **everyone** is a pawn of Aleister Crowley. A number of them are aware of this (so, not unwitting), but The Hero, Touma, is not. There are even some hints that Aleister is trying to pull one over on _Aiwass_, though until we actually know what his plan is it's hard to say.
-   In the anime of _Chrono Crusade_, nearly everything that the main characters do seem to play right into Aion's hands. In the end, even though almost all of the main cast die, they only seem to stop him temporarily.
-   Poor Suzaku Kururugi from _Code Geass_. Being an emotional, impulsive, and naive mix of Death Seeker and Wide-Eyed Idealist in a series full of Chessmasters and Manipulative Bastards is _definitely_ his perdition. On the other hand, his supernaturally effective combat abilities and tendency to run head first into dangerous situations without telling anybody means he's derailed almost as many schemes as he's aided.
    -   Same for the Order of the Black Knights, which was first manipulated by Lelouch before becoming Schneizel's pawns. Lelouch actually _is_ the hero who is trying to save the world. He has a lot of bad luck and some questionable methods, but the Black Knights generally benefited from his actions, manipulation aside. Schneizel, not so much. He has decent luck, if not good, and his methods are not questionable — they're definitely not good for the human race as a whole.
-   Alice of _Code Geass: Nightmare of Nunnally_, desperate to save Nunnally, accepts help from Anya and proceeds to Kamine Island. It turns out that Anya was possessed by Empress Marianne, who needed Nunnally to complete her and Charles' Assimilation Plot. Thankfully, Alice telling Nunnally that she values her as an individual derails the plan.
-   _Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School_:
    -   Downplayed for Izuru Kamukura. In his introduction in _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_, he was supposedly the one responsible for starting The Tragedy (albeit manipulated by Junko) by killing the student council of Hope's Peak Academy. The anime shows the direct leadup to the event and pretty much confirms that Alter Ego Junko was flat-out lying about Izuru being a willing collaborator. He _did_ willingly allow Junko to continue her evil plans because she told him the results might be interesting, but he actually just watched the Student Council kill each other, only killing one person in self-defense. Junko manipulated video of that kill to make it _look_ like he'd massacred everyone in service of her plan. Izuru didn't really know the full extent of her plans, and eventually turns against her when Junko kills Chiaki.
    -   Kyosuke Munakata from the Future Arc is a straight example, as his extremist anti-despair views mean that he plays right into the Remnants of Despair's hands by going on a rampage murdering the Future Foundation leadership (when most of them were genuinely trying to help the world) and trying to kill Makoto Naegi _because_ he was an All-Loving Hero (Munakata thought that he was being too soft) instead of, y'know, _working with people to get out of the latest killing game_. It turns out that he was serving the Remnants of Despair more directly than anyone, including himself, thought- his girlfriend Chisa was actually a Remnant of Despair (having been brainwashed into it during the Despair Arc) and she was pushing him into extremism because she knew full well his heavy-handed ideology was going to harm his own cause more than that of Despair.
    -   In general, unless your name is Izuru Kamakura, if you spoke to Junko or get involved with her at any point, she will play you like a fiddle and you'll have no idea what's actually going on. Look no further to the Reserve Course students who are outright manipulated to burn down Hope's Peak, kill most of the students and commit suicide. The only person who will genuinely and unconditionally do work for her is Monaca Towa and even then she's still considered another victim rather than the Junko-like beast she tried to become and is intended to be.
-   In _Death Note_, _nearly everybody_ falls victim to this trope at some point, Chessmasters included. Misa is the only major character who does not, and that's likely because she makes it clear in their first conversation that she doesn't mind being used by Light. She certainly is a pawn, but not an unwitting one.
    -   Every member of the Task Force ends up being suckered in by Light at some point, not only buying his innocence, but also treating him as their actual leader and the new L.
    -   Double Subverted by Rem, who kills L for Light in order to save Misa from being arrested. She figures out _exactly_ what Light is trying to get her to do, how he's getting her to do it, and what will happen if she goes through with it (she dies)... And she does it anyway.
    -   Perhaps the biggest Unwitting Pawn in the series is _Light himself_. For all of his chessmaster pretensions, Xanatos-grade scheming, and proclamations of Godhood, he was never anything more than a plaything for Ryuk's personal amusement. The best part is that Ryuk actually spells that out to him — along with what will ultimately happen to him — within minutes of first meeting him but Light never realizes the full implications until it is too late.
        -   Averted, and very much so. Light understands perfectly well what he is to Ryuk, which is why he makes sure to stay interesting in his clever Scheherezade Gambit, which remains very effective until Light is cornered and captured, and thus no longer able to provide entertainment and apples for Ryuk.
    -   L falls headfirst into this trope when he decides to test the thirteen day rule, which provokes Rem to kill him, exactly as Light planned. In the manga, his thoughts before his death leave it unambiguous that it wasn't the outcome he considered.
-   _Fairy Tail_: Jellal is victim of this _twice_. He spends eight years as Ultear's pawn, and then Brain uses him to awaken Nirvana. To a lesser extent Reitei Lyon and his entire group, everyone working under Jellal in the Tower of Heaven, the first magic council. Basically, if you've spoken to Ultear, assume you're being used.
-   Oliver Cromwell, leader of the Reconquista movement and Big Bad of the first arc of _The Familiar of Zero_ is ultimately this for King Joseph of Gallia, the ultimate Big Bad of much of the series. Cromwell's rebellion would not have gotten anywhere without Gallian aid and the only reason why Joseph helped in the first place was so he could use the chaos of the war as a cover to slip his agents into Albion in order to find the Founder's Music Box as part of his plan to gather Brimir's Void relics and harness their power.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist_, Kimblee masses the Drachman army to attack Amestris from the north, in order to cause enough bloodshed to complete Father's giant Transmutation Circle. All the Drachmans are defeated except for the General, who calls Kimblee out. Kimblee then coolly states that he didn't care which side lost as long as lots of people died. The General is then hit by one last shot from the Amestrians, to add death to insult and injury.
    -   Hohenheim's backstory reveals that the Emperor of Xerxes also fit this bill. Father lured him into creating a nation-wide transmutation circle, claiming it would grant the Emperor immortality. Instead, Father used it to give immortality to himself and Hohenheim, at the price of the _entire nation_.
        -   Father wasn't lying when he said he would grant the Emperor immortality, he just never said the Emperor would be immortal inside the stone.
    -   The upper echelon of Central's military were suckered into following the same scheme with similar promises.
    -   In _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_, the homunculi manipulate alchemists into trying to create the Philosopher's Stone so that their leader Dante can use it for her own immortality. Dante also falsely promises to make the homunculi human if they succeed.
-   _Gundam_:
    -   Treize Khushrenada is such a Magnificent Bastard he turns essentially the ENTIRE CAST of _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_ into Unwitting Pawns.
    -   _After War Gundam X_: Carris Nautilus is a talented artificial Newtype pilot, who believes he's protecting the peace of Fort Severn, but really, his leader, Nomoa Long is using him as a pawn in his revenge plot.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_: Everyone — but especially Patrick Zala and Muruta Azrael — serve as Unwitting Pawns to series' Big Bad Rau Le Creuset.
    -   In _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny_, Shinn Asuka, and to a lesser extent, the rest of the _Minerva_'s crew, are the Unwitting Pawns of Chairman Durandal.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury_: Suletta Mercury is being manipulated by her mother Prospera as part of her agenda.
-   _He's Dedicated to Roses_: Hak-Yoon ends up being one to Mi-Mi, who manipulated him by pretending to like him, then had him and his gang rape her maid and film it in front of two of said maid's best friends, all because she was jealous that the maid had gotten the boy she was _really_ in love with, and when said plan fell through, abandoned him to his fate and told him he was nothing more than a pawn for her revenge. He isn't too happy about this.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   _Stardust Crusaders_: In his Establishing Character Moment, Hol Horse sees Nena as a gullible young woman he can exploit, as he later tells J. Geil that women who are devoted enough to sacrifice their lives for him are "useful". Ironically, Nena herself is using Hol Horse to get close to the Joestar group so she can kill them.
    -   _Golden Wind_: Diavolo was using The Hitman Team to fight off the heroes, hoping they'd kill each other, rather than kill them all himself. This plan goes rather swimmingly for the most part, but turns out to be a mistake that almost gets him killed by the remaining member, Risotto, if not for a coincidental attack by Narancia on the latter.
    -   _Stone Ocean_: Jolyne gets used to lure her father, Jotaro, into a trap when she is framed for a hit-and-run, which Pucci uses the opportunity to catch Jotaro off-guard and steal his memories and Stand.
    -   _JoJolion_: Jobin didn't realize that the Rock Humans were willing to harm his family to get the Locacaca Fruit when he realized Poor Tom lied about Ozon Baby's powers. He survives their attempt to dispose of him and come out of it with the long end of the stick.
-   _Kagerou Project_: Ayano. After finding evidence that her father is under the Demonic Possession of the Wide-Open Eyes Snake and that he will kill her younger siblings and two thirds of her social circle to succeed in creating a new Medusa in our world. Understandably, she falls into despair, and after a long conversation with the snake himself, Ayano decides that the only way is to kill herself, enter the Daze to get possessed by a snake herself, and choose to stay behind — ensuring the Medusa plan cannot come off. Except, that was what he wanted all along; by having his plan ruined, his host's wish cannot be fulfilled; the Snake has an excuse to reset time, thereby ensuring he will be able to continue existing.
-   In _Maiden Rose_, by launching an offensive against a train invading his country without orders Taki ends up playing right into his ally Princess Theodora's hands (she having secretly murdered everyone on the train herself in a coup before he fired on it), and is placed under house arrest despite being the commander holding the front in a war against their mutual enemy.
-   _Mazinger Z_: Dr. Hell was Archduke Gorgon's unwitting pawn. Gorgon wanted to destroy both Dr. Hell and Mazinger-Z, so he helped Hell to fight Kouji Kabuto and his allies because the constant conflict weakened and wore the heroes down, and as soon as Hell stopped being useful, he abandoned him and let him die (or killed him personally in some versions) while his War Beasts finished Mazinger-Z off.
-   So many in _Monster_ as the series' Big Bad, Johan, plays everyone like a fiddle in order to get what he wants. At one point, he has a town of Unwitting Pawns as he moves them to the point where they all start massacring each other.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   At the beginning of the series, we have the Sound Genin, used by Orochimaru in the Chunin Exams. Dosu actually realises this, but all three meet a premature demise before he can do anything about it.
    -   The Akatsuki as a whole were this to their true leader, Tobi, who manipulated them into believing he was a clueless member of the organization but used them to further achieve his Eye of the Moon Plan. Besides Tobi, the only Akatsuki members who know their true goal are Kisame and Zetsu.
    -   Then Sasuke which was the Unwitting Pawn of both Itachi and Tobi. No wonder he developed Chronic Backstabbing Disorder.
        -   Itachi ultimately was one for Tobi. Itachi believed, like almost everyone else who was confronted by him, that Tobi was Madara, and despite his efforts to act in defiance, all of his failsafes to protect Sasuke from Tobi failed and he only succeeded in making Sasuke into a more powerful and hateful pawn for Tobi to manipulate.
        -   Yahiko also became a pawn to Tobi, since his suicide was Nagato's Start of Darkness and made him join Tobi which in turn allowed Tobi to take Akatsuki under his control.
        -   Also Danzo, which in spite of all his motives also became this to Tobi. So nearly all his actions played into Tobi's hands: His union with Hanzo in the betrayal of Nagato allowed Tobi to take Akatsuki under his control. Also he manipulated Itachi into slaying his clan which allowed Tobi not only to acquire a large number of Sharingan, but also use Itachi to find a new pawn in the person of Sasuke. And Danzo is the one who reveals to the Kages that Tobi is Madara, which is exactly what Tobi wants them to believe.
        -   Also Kakashi became one to Tobi or rather Obito. The entire fight with Kakashi into the Kamui dimension was planned by Obito in order to remove Madara's seal as it prevented him from becoming the Ten Tails Jinchuuriki, and Kakashi did what Obito wanted: Hit him in the heart.
    -   Rin and Kakashi (although the latter's part was just a happy coincidence) were pawns in Madara's plan to create a successor by driving Obito to despair.
    -   The _entire world_, but especially Indra, the Uchiha Clan, Madara, and Kabuto were this to Black Zetsu in his pursuit to revive Kaguya.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: What Shinji Ikari appears to be this in whatever it is his, father, Gendo is planning. But there is a rather big twist. In the end, it turns Shinji was only ever of minor importance to Gendo's plans; Gendo only ever really needed him to pilot Unit-01, truly nothing more and nothing less. In reality, it turns out Shinji's true crucial role that he never knew anything about or never saw coming, was as the lynchpin in his mother, Yui's, plan to derail SEELE's Assimilation Plot in the final minutes of the eleventh hour.
    -   As part of the backstory, Misato's father, Dr. Katsuragi, was manipulated by SEELE into causing Second Impact.
    -   _Rebuild of Evangelion_ has this really bad. Everyone is pawns to Gendo. In the series at least, it's eventually shown that Gendo isn't quite as slick as he thought he was when Rei and Ritsuko turn on him and Seele sends troops to kill him. In the end ,he doesn't get what he wants, largely because Rei gives control to Shinji instead, who ends up killing him in Instrumentality. In _Rebuild_, he somehow manages to trick Seele into killing themselves (shutting themselves down thinking it would help the plan), and he manages to con Kaworu, who's an all-knowing Angel himself. Admittedly, Kaworu figures it out at the last minute, but because Shinji had already been sold on the idea that the spears would fix the problem, he didn't listen to him and pulled them anyway. He even allows Misato's team to show up to stop the Impact, because it wasn't time (he just wanted Unit 13 to obtain God mode).
    -   Another interpretation is that _everyone_ is a Unwitting Pawn for Yui Ikari.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Whitebeard was a target for this. The World Government wanted to kill him and his whole crew with a barricade killzone trap and execute Ace, the son of the Pirate King once they are stuck as a warning to all Pirates and cement their power. However, Whitebeard, while he still dies, manages to re-ignite the Golden Age of Pirates, and most of his crew and allies survive. Also, technically Ace was saved, but still dies anyways. However, in the end, he, and technically the WG, is still fooled by the true mastermind and main cause of the war, Blackbeard. His plan was that he knew Whitebeard would risk anything to save a single of his crew, and the WG would do anything to take him down. While everyone is focusing on Marine HQ, Blackbeard slips into Impel Down, recruits the strongest prisoners of Level Six, which contains some of the worst criminals in the history of the world, sails back, kills Whitebeard, steals Whitebeard's destructive powers for his own means, and then makes a clean escape.
    -   Trafalgar Law (of all people), thinks he's this to _Luffy_. You would think that manipulating the Straw Hats would be a piece of cake thanks to their captain's unassuming nature. Unfortunately for Law, he didn't account for the antics or Luffy's "I do whatever the hell I want" attitude, and it becomes increasingly obvious to him and the audience that he was never in control of the alliance, especially when Luffy admits that his plan to take down Kaido works towards Luffy's goal of taking down _all_ of the Four Emperors, and that he's _using_ Law's plan for that goal.
    -   Shogun of Wano, Kurozumi Orochi never once thought that Kaido would ever betray him and that the two were equals, ignorant that Kaido hated him and was using him for his own plans (otherwise, a weakling and conniving snake like Orochi would not have become Shogun in the first place). Thus, when Kaido announces his plans to turn Wano into a "New Onigashima", Orochi protests, only to be beheaded in the spot.
-   _Peach Girl_: Toji and most of the Spear Carriers in the first arc, and Gigoro in the second. Of special note is Gigoro's actions in "The Destruction of Pure Love"; he starts to realize that Sae's account of Momo isn't entirely accurate, so he tries to get Momo's side of the story... by _chasing her through the warehouse district_, not saying anything less stalker-y than "I need to talk to you."
-   Alain from _Pokémon the Series: XY_ is this to Team Flare, until his breaking upon learning the team's true intentions when Ash gets captured, during the Team Flare Arc.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_: Poor Homura. So you wanted to save your friend from certain death using your Faust powered wish? Well you did technically save her by making it so as long she is not saved, the timeline repeat itself. Unfortunately, you also helped Kyuubey create what is the ultimate power source based on people suffering since Madoka is not only a juicy power source but since with every cycle Homura becomes more cynical, her suffering only gives even more power with each interval. And she can do nothing to get out of the loop.
    -   Really, ALL magical girls are this, since Kyubey tricks them into a Magically-Binding Contract that will result in either thier death or transformation into a witch.
    -   Homura gets this even worse in Rebellion, wherein she is turned into an "unborn" witch by Kyubey, then used to trap Madoka and the others inside her barrier.
-   Makoto Isshiki in _RahXephon_. He takes down Tokyo Jupiter, but all he achieves by doing so is enabling the Mulians to invade the outside world en masse.
-   In _Rebuild World_, Alpha promises to let Akira sell the relic she's after for a huge amount of cash. But it becomes increasingly clear over the course of the story that she has big plans for this relic and gets him to thoughtlessly agree to parts of her contract to give herself more sway over him. Later subverted when Akira points out to someone who tries to turn him against Alpha, a long list of Manipulative Bitch things she's done to him, some of which haven't been pointed out in the narrative before. Akira says that he serves her because I Gave My Word and I Owe You My Life.
-   In _The Seven Deadly Sins_, the entire Holy Knights order (especially Jericho and Vivian) were being used by Hendrickson, who himself was being used by Dreyfus, in order to awake the Demon Clan, the remaining Ten Commandments, and reignite the holy war.
-   Maka ends up one of these in _Soul Eater_, when convinced by Medusa that the witch truly cares about her child (a reaction very heavily hinted to be down to her relationship with her father). She is used to defeat Arachne, which in turn gives Medusa's soul a new body to inhabit, while demonstrating to the witch that Maka has sufficient power to be a serious threat to witches. Medusa then tries, but fails, to kill Maka due to the timely appearance of Chekhov's Gunman. Needless to say the Manipulative Bastard made another attempt.
-   _Almost the entire cast_ to Head in _Star Driver_.
-   Lavinia Reberth of _Str.A.In.: Strategic Armored Infantry_ is a Fangirl of epic proportions, who'd do anything to get some of Sara's attention. Dress up as a Playboy Bunny? Failed. Ambush her in the shower? Got the wrong girl. Steal her most precious possession? Dropped it in a garbage dump, which ended up with Sara's true identity revealed to the whole crew, the Libertad kicked out of port before it could complete repairs, and one of their teammates dead. Oops.
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul:Re_, it turns out that the _entire_ CCG has been this all along. Not only has the Washuu Clan been conspiring with a ghoul organization all along, but they are _themselves_ secretly a family of ghouls. The Knight Templars and sadistic ghoul-haters of the organization have been fighting and dying on the orders of ghouls _all along_. All to maintain an endless conflict between the two species, and keep these two groups in power.
-   _Toriko_: The entire conflict between the good guys (IGO) and the original bad guys (Gourmet corp) was controlled by the until-then unknown NEO organization. Tons of different characters (including Midora, both in his youth and in the present) were manipulated by Acacia and the Blue Nitro.
-   _Transformers: Armada_: Almost every major non-human character takes a turn being one of these, as would be expected when The Mole happens to be a Manipulative Bastard.
-   Who in _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_ **isn't** playing into Fei Wong Reed's plans, again? Kurogane might be the least manipulated of the group, but he's not exactly immune, either. He _is_ the (positive kind of) pawn of Ichihara Yuuko, though and thus serves as the counterpart to poor Fai.
-   _Variable Geo_: This applies equally to the entrants of the VG tournament, regardless whether it's for the grand prize, the desire to compete, or to settle grudges against other participants. In the end, they're all being used as unwitting test subjects, by The Jahana Group, who secretly monitor the tournament to determine which of them will make the ideal host body for Miranda's disembodied spirit.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Zorc manipulated Akhenaden into translating the spells that would create the Millennium Items, the plan being all along that the Items would revive Zorc.
    -   Near the end of the first season of _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_, Sho assumes that everybody in Duel Academy were the pawns of Kagemaru, the season's Big Bad.
    -   In the second season of _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_, this is the standard MO of the Barians (especially Gilag); they brainwash one or more duelists, then give them a powerful Spell Card called "Rank-Up Magic — Barian's Force" which can be used to summon powerful monsters called "Chaos Xyzs", which they also provide. This plan never worked (and in Gilag's case, almost got him killed when it went wrong), and it took a long time for it to sink in that they should try something different. (But in their defense, eventually they did.) Except Vector who masqueraded as a student named "Rei Shingetsu" and played Yuma like a fiddle. Giving him some card (Number 66 to lure him and several V cards and Rank Up Magic -- Limited Barian's Force to use against him with Vain -- Sneer of Betrayal).

    Comic Books 

-   In IDW Publishing's _Beast Wars_ comics, the Predacon Shokaract believes that he is the mastermind of a plot to elevate himself to godhood. He has no idea that his lieutenants are worshippers of Unicron, the Transformer God of Evil, and are manipulating him to bring about their master’s return.
-   _DIE_: Sol and the various writers who became the Masters were ultimately all pawns of Die itself, which reached through time to manipulate them all into creating the archetypes and game which led to its creation.
-   When Doctor Octopus reformed the Sinister Six in the six-part story "Return of the Sinister Six", he used the other five members this way. He told them that his plan was to launch a satellite armed with a deadly poison, and then blackmail the world into making them its rulers lest they use it. This was a lie. The "poison" was something used to prevent people from using cocaine, and he planned to blackmail cartels and everyone else who benefitted from the drug trade, gaining incredible influence in the underworld on an international level — alone.
-   In _Green Lantern_ story _Sinestro Corps War_, the Guardians and the Green Lantern Corps turn out to be these after Sinestro reveals that he (Sinestro) won the war by making the Guardians override their own principles and disable the "no killing" function on the Lantern rings.
-   _Hound_: Queen Maeve doesn't realise that she's being used as a pawn by Morrigan—who masquerades at her court of Connact as her Fomorian advisor, Calatin.

-   In _The Multiversity_, a number of characters unknowingly further The Gentry's invasion.
    -   _Ultra Comics #1_: Ultra Comics itself acts as vector of contagion to The Gentry in different worlds (including ours).

-   One of the more hated aspects of _The Punisher: Purgatory_ was the retcon that Frank Costa was really a demon named Olivier put into the body of a stillborn baby and that he orchestrated the events that caused Frank Castle to become the Punisher so Castle could be one of these for him, building an army of those Castle killed.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_:
    -   Mina Mongoose was this to Ixis Naugus — he used her musical protests against NICOLE as a conduit for his magic, inflaming the public's distrust of NICOLE into paranoia and hatred, beginning a series of events that leads to Naugus being appointed king of New Mobotropolis.
    -   Geoffrey St. John. It was pretty obvious that Naugus was taking advantage of the then recent death of Geoffrey's father Ian St. John to get the poor kid to help him. Any doubts were dropped when Naugus possessed Geoffrey to escape his mutations.
-   _Superman_:
    -   In the _H'el on Earth_ arc, H'El seduced Supergirl and talked her into helping him bring Krypton back, assuring that no Earthmen would suffer. She joined him... until she found out that his plan involved blowing the Sun up and destroying Earth. Then she turned on him right away.

    -   _Superman and Spider-Man_: Doctor Doom uses a screeching micro-drone to lead Hulk towards Metropolis and starts tearing the city up. Naturally, Hulk knows nothing about Doom or the drone, and he does not even notice his mad rampage has allowed the Parasite to break out of containment (which is exactly what Doom wanted).
-   _Ultimate Marvel_:
    -   _The Ultimates_: The Liberators and their backers are motivated by rejection of the American foreign policies, and intended to "Liberate" the US from what they saw as an evil government.

    Fan Works 

### Crossovers

-   _Avenger Goddess_: Over the course of the flashback/World War II arc, it becomes rapidly apparent (and is eventually outright confirmed in Chapter 23) that for all his delusions of grandeur, the Red Skull is just Ares' puppet in his plans to test and corrupt Diana.
-   _The Bridge_:
    -   The Big Bad brings King Sombra Back from the Dead, and sets him to try and retake control of the Crystal Empire, which somehow furthers the Big Bad's own plans. For his part, Sombra doesn't know how he's alive, and doesn't particularly _care_.
    -   Later, the Windigos use Sci-Twi and Wallflower Blush as their pawns to destroy the human world by lying to them about being benevolent spirits trying to save their world from destruction.
-   _Children of an Elder God_:

-   _The Equestrian Wind Mage_: Season 2 focuses on the heroes waging war with Ganondorf, who's trying to take control of Equestria.

-   _Infinity Train: Blossoming Trail_: Trip brings up this trope in regards to making sure Goh never finds out about the Infinity Train.

-   _Last Child of Krypton_: Shinji was meant to be Gendo’s unsuspecting puppet, but his inability to synch with an Evangelion prevented this. The remaining characters were the paws of Gendo and SEELE until Kaji blew the lid off their little conspiracy.
-   _Mare of Steel_: Brainiac allies with Steel Wing, supposedly to help him capture and destroy Rainbow Dash/Supermare.

-   _Percy Jackson: Spirits_: Vaatu apparently manipulated Sozin into starting the War and wiping out the airbenders to eliminate their spiritual traditions and keep them from performing the rituals that kept the sky cleansed of his influence, Zhao into using Wan Shi Tong's knowledge to help kill Tui and cause the other spirit to withdraw from the human world with his library and the contained knowledge, and maybe even Amon into trying to eliminate bending so that the world would be less able to defend itself against him.

    -   Subverted. Gendo and SEELE turned everyone into their unwitting pawns… but Shinji and the other Children realized that they were being manipulated, and in turn they used Gendo.

-   _The Warmistress of Equestria_: The Traitor Legions trick rogue griffon General Blackwing into an alliance, and aiding in setting up a False Flag Operation to start a war between Equestria and the griffons in order to further the Traitor Legionnaires' goal of destroying Celestia. Meanwhile, within the Traitor Legionnaires' alliance, Lord Talon Hoof thinks that he's the supreme leader, but is being manipulated by Scorpan as part of his plan to empower and release his master Tirac from the Warp.

### _Danganronpa_

-   _or did it eat the little girl?_: During the final trial, Kokichi realizes that while they'd _thought_ they were defying all expectations, they were actually playing right into The Director's hands and playing their role to the hilt.

### _The DCU_

-   In _A Force of Four_, Wonder Woman's old enemy Badra frees three Kryptonian criminals emprisoned by Superman and strikes up an alliance with them to destroy their enemies and then Earth.

### _Godzilla_

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: This _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_ fanfiction indicates that Alan Jonah becomes the kind who helps on accident rather than being actively manipulated, by selling biological samples of Ghidorah's tissue from San's old head on to other parties on the Titan DNA market. It's later hinted that Bio-Major (one of Jonah's customers) in particular are unknowingly aiding Ghidorah's long-term plans by using Ghidorah's DNA in new fertility treatments.

### _Harry Potter_

-   _The Parselmouth of Gryffindor_: Cornelius Fudge is ridiculously easy to manipulate, be it by Dolores Umbridge, Lucius Malfoy or someone else. He's actually a good guy at heart, but only avoids causing a world catastrophe because Hermione (who has come to control him most usually, and, therefore rule Magical Britain from the shadows) keeps a tight leash on him.
-   _Destiny Intertwined_: Vitreus is informed that he was one of these by his father after Hayze's "trial". While he was told to keep an eye on Hayze because his family thought Hayze was dangerous, it turns out afterwards that the Frostspears didn't really care whether Hayze was dangerous or not, and were just looking for an excuse to discredit Lynerius and his clan, something that badly affects Vitreus's trust and confidence in his family.

### _Love Hina_

-   _Entering The Love Hina World_: Naru becomes one for Masako and RubyCorp. She's so intent on getting revenge on everyone who's "wronged her" by calling her out on her selfish behavior that she fails to see that her "allies" are planning to demolish the Hinata Inn in order to make way for their property expansion project. All Masako has to do is claim that she'll have the manager replaced with a woman for Naru to fall hook, line and sinker.
-   _For His Own Sake_:
    -   Granny Hina merrily used Keitaro as one, right up until he decided enough was enough and left the Hinata Inn.
    -   Mutsumi winds up as one to Kagura and Chisato; while she believes they support her quest to get Naru and Keitaro back together, they have much _nastier_ designs on the latter.

### _Marvel Universe_

-   _FIRE! (DarkMark)_: Played straight with every villain recruited by Firebrand... and subverted with Doctor Doom who, when contacted, sees through his words and refuses to become a tool.
    
    "The answer is no."  
    "But, your excellency—"  
    "NO. Doom does not conspire. Doom is not used. Doom uses! This conversation is ended." He stabbed a button on his console that would not only break the contact, but prevent further contact from being made.  
    The gall. The insufferable, common-man gall of the representative. To think that he himself, Doctor Doom, would possibly—could possibly—be induced to participatory activity with a too-large band of costumed inferiors in a disruptory mission of ill-defined intent.
    

### _Mass Effect_

-   In _The Council Era_, Krogan Overlord Tikrog Kurvok unknowingly becomes a pawn in his advisor Halak Marr's plot to start the Krogan Rebellions and turn the Krogan into a Master Race.
-   _Mass Effect 2 AU Lanius_: No matter what the _player_ learns about the true nature of Cerberus and what they're up to, _Shepard_ never finds out. What's worse, bt the time _Mass Effect 3_ rolls around, Shepard has been indoctrinated by the Reapers without realizing it.
-   _Mass Effect: The Iron Heart of Man_ makes this one of the favorite tactics of the Asari matriarchs. However, this works against them when they set up a Batman Gambit to manipulate the Quarians in this fashion, only for the Quarians to not do as they expected — and, in the process, discover and make first contact with humanity.

### _Miraculous Ladybug_

-   _BURN THE WITCH_:
    -   Lila Rossi treats all of her 'friends' as such. When Rose/Witch Hunter tearfully declares that she just wanted to be friends, Lila insists that they _were_ — because in her mind, friend is just a fancy word for people who can do things for you.
    -   When Hawkmoth informs her that her services are no longer required, he twists the knife by sadistically calling her "_Friend_," causing her to realize that he played her the exact same way that she's manipulated countless others.
-   _Dad Villain AU_: Emelie sees absolutely nothing wrong with using the Peacock Pin freely, despite how the magical jewelry is clearly broken; after all, she hasn't suffered any ill effects for it! What she doesn't realize is that this is because her husband made a Wish that redirects the magical backlash onto other people — specifically targeting Ladybug and her loved ones out of sheer spitefulness. He is perfectly happy to let his wife unwittingly hurt others, turning her into a vehicle for his petty revenge.
-   _The Karma of Lies_:
    -   Lila pretends to be this after Gabriel is exposed as Hawkmoth, spinning a sob story about how he got her into modeling in order to discreetly pump her for information about her classmates, using her to gauge their emotional states and determine who might be most vulnerable to akumatization. She takes this a step further by pretending that Adrien was in on it, acting unaware of the possibility that her 'beloved boyfriend' could have been involved even while planting the seeds of suspicion in her mother and Officer Roger's minds.
    -   Adrien, meanwhile, is a straight example. Lila convinces him that she's remorseful about her past manipulations, getting him to agree to help her out in exchange for coming clean to their classmates. Not only is she setting him up as a scapegoat the whole time, she further exploits his trust by memorizing the password to the Agrestes' emergency fund account.
-   _Leave for Mendeleiev_: Mme. Bustier serves as one for Chloé due to being a Horrible Judge of Character who desperately wants to believe that the resident bully just needs to be surrounded by 'good examples' — as in students who follow her Extreme Doormat teachings. Thus, when Chloé claims that she just can't focus as well without Marinette (her favorite _target_) around, Bustier starts badgering her to consider transferring _back_ into the same class as her tormentor, or to consider mentoring her.
-   _Truth and Consequences_:
    -   After making a deal with Hawkmoth, Ladybug manipulates Team Miraculous into helping her try to get her hands on the Black Cat Ring. Downplayed to some extent with Alya, Nino and Chloé, as they suspect that _something's_ amiss, but Luka plays this straight.
    -   Hawkmoth also turns Luka into one when he becomes Mayura. Unbeknownst to them, Hawkmoth is able to see through their eyes, enabling him to figure out the secret identities of most of Paris' heroes by the climax.
-   _Villain Of Your Own Story_: The Alya who became Hawkmoth in the alternate reality serves as one to Adrien. While she thinks Adrien's helping her out as she _pretends_ to be a supervillain in order to lure other Miraculous Holders out of hiding, he's actually using her to get revenge upon their classmates for how their testimony led to Chloé winding up in juvie.
-   In _Weight Off Your Shoulder_, Alya and most of the Girl Posse grow worried that the new Ladybug might be manipulating Marinette in some way. The truth of the matter is that Future!Alix is the one manipulating all of _them_, trying to Make Wrong What Once Went Right so she can keep abusing the Rabbit Pocketwatch.
-   _What Goes Around Comes Around_:
    -   Lila happily accepts Gabriel's suggestion that she invite all of her classmates (minus Marinette) to an exclusive party his company is holding in Versailles, especially since he asks her to pass it off as completely her idea. What she doesn't know is that Gabriel has recently discovered Ladybug's Secret Identity, and is using her to ensure that Marinette is isolated while he launches his final assault.
    -   Thanks to his Delusions of Parental Love, Adrien is easily manipulated by his mother into giving her the Black Cat Ring.
    -   While Nathalie was further in the love than Chloé or Lila, she still wasn't aware of just how far her bosses intended to go. She also didn't know that she wasn't the _original_ Nathalie, being a sentimonster created to replace the real one after she learned too much — something the police take considerable pleasure in revealing to her.

### _My Hero Academia_

-   _Erased Potential_: Principal Nedzu repeatedly manipulates Toshinori to his own ends; he points him towards Izuku as a potential successor for One For All despite knowing that Izuku is aiming to become a Quirkless Pro Hero, then uses Toshinori to reveal to the other students that Izuku is a sponsored student. Eventually, this spurs Toshinori to join in on Aizawa and Hizashi's threat to quit U.A. Aizawa also revolves to get Toshinori in the loop so that he can't be tricked as easily anymore.
-   _Mastermind: Rise of Anarchy_: Katsuki's destructive search for personal catharsis after the events of _Strategist For Hire_ plays right into the hands of Principal Nedzu. He becomes the violent vigilante 'King', taking out his frustrations on petty criminals; unbeknownest to him, Nedzu is fully aware of his nightly activities, and allows him to continue purely so that he can set Ochako against him, as part of his grander scheme to build Ochako up into the next Symbol of Peace.
-   _One for All and Eight for the Ninth_ has All for One having placed a tracking device in Aoyama's belt so it will tell him where the U.A. students are, entirely without its owner's knowledge.
-   _The Scorpion Jar_ revolves around Izuku taking advantage of how petty, self-serving and back-biting his bullies at Aldera are by manipulating them into selling each other out for their own gain. He then submits all the evidence they've gathered of their peers' various misdeeds to the Board of Education, prompting a _massive_ investigation.
-   _Think Before You Speak_: Aizawa exploits Tensei's Big Brother Instinct by falsely claiming that Izuku was responsible for Tenya being injured during a training exercise. He does this with the intent of having Tensei spread that Malicious Slander to the media, destroying the innocent student's reputation by having him Convicted by Public Opinion. Tensei is aghast when he learns the truth, though the backlash hit both of them rather than Aizawa's intended target.
-   _What it Means to Be a Hero_:
    -   After Endeavor suffers an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Re-Destro, All For One suggests taking advantage of the situation and turning him into one of their tools. Later on, during the Tokyo Invasion arc, they make their move, hitting him with a dose of Trigger to unleash the full force of his flames before revealing his darkest secrets to all of Japan. This heavily undermines the public's trust in Heroes.
    -   Nezu muses that this may be the _real_ reason that Sir Nighteye gave Mirio an internship, and why he's so invested in setting him up as All Might's successor: not for "the greater good" as he claims, but because having the new Symbol of Peace as his apprentice would boost his agency's profile and image.

### _Naruto_

-   _Son of the Sannin_ does this in a particularly cathartic way to _Danzo_, of all people. During several arcs, he sabotages and undermines Konoha's efforts to protect the jinchuuriki by leaking intel to the Akatsuki, arrogantly believing that he can exploit the situation by letting the Akatsuki gather all the Tailed Beasts together, then swoop in and seize the lot in Konoha's name. Come Chapter 90, it's revealed that _Obito Uchiha_ planted that idea in his head using Kotomatsukami years ago, as a way of monitoring Orochimaru while sabotaging Konoha from the inside out. To cap it off, Obito planted a mental trigger to make Danzo completely obedient, using it to retrieve one of Pain's Rinnegan eyes before ordering him to commit suicide via Reverse Tetragram Sealing once he's done with him.

### _Neon Genesis Evangelion_

-   Shinji and Asuka figuring out that they're unwitting pawns is an important subplot in _Advice and Trust_. When they open up to each other and start talking about their childhoods and their piloting experiences, they figure out that Gendo and SEELE are keeping things from them and realize that they're being used to further some kind of sinister scheme. They even managed to completely ruin Gendo's plan by befriending Rei, before they even realized that he _had_ a plan. And he's none the wiser.
-   _Evangelion 303_: Although Gendo seems to be less abusive than his canon self, he keeps a secret agenda and he’s using everyone –including his son and his son’s fiancée- to carry it out.
-   In _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide_, Misato and all pilots are unwitting pawns to Gendo to test a computer program known as the Emerald Tablet and destroy SEELE. When Misato finds out about it, she decides to turn on NERV.
-   _Once More with Feeling_ subverted this. NERV's staff is Gendo's unwitting pawns, and the UN is SEELE's one. However, Shinji pretends to be also clueless, although he knows what they're exactly planning, and he warned the Japanese Government via Kaji.
-   _The Second Try_:
    -   Subverted. Gendo and SEELE believe that everyone are their pawns… but due to time-travel shenanigans, Shinji and Asuka know exactly what they intend to do and later they tell Misato.
    -   From a certain point of view, Shinji and Asuka are reluctantly using everybody in NERV as their pawns to avert the end of the world.

### _Persona_

-   _Wanted It To Be A Game_: In this Role Swap AU, Seito manipulates Kou Ichijou into believing that the TV World is actually a safe place, so that they'll put people in there in hopes of protecting them.

### _Rosario + Vampire_

-   _Rosario Vampire: Brightest Darkness Act III_:
    -   During the course of the fic, Kuyou attacks Yokai Academy with the intent to get revenge on Tsukune for his previous defeat. It's ultimately revealed that Hokuto personally manipulated Kuyou into doing so by exploiting his hatred of Tsukune, using the resulting chaos as a distraction so he could break into the secured levels of the academy and steal an Artifact of Doom for use in his Evil Plan. Hokuto gets what he wanted, and Kuyou is Killed Off for Real by Tsukune.
    -   As revealed near the end of the act, Akua and Kahlua aided Kiria in his plan to rewrite history with the Chrono Displacement spell, intending to give their father Issa a top spot in the new world once humanity is subjugated. In the final chapter, it's revealed that Kiria's plan would ensure that _he_ would be the sole dark lord, and part of said plan would have Akua and Kahlua, and possibly Moka and Kokoa as well, infected with Blackheart and then sent back in time to kill Issa and destroy his empire from within, thus ensuring that Kiria would rule unopposed. The two promptly switch sides and spend the next act trying to atone for their mistake.

### _A Song of Ice and Fire_

-   _Asshai's Flames_ has Senira, who unknowingly helps her mother's plan, which more or less applies to the _whole monastery_ too. She realizes this in the end and kills Selye when Asshai falls, which means her own death as well.

### _Spongebob Squarepants_

-   _A Dash of Logic_: Both "Truth or Square" and "Plankton's Regular" show that Mr. Krabs is allowing his feud with Plankton to continue purely for the sake of free marketing. Because having the town's most infamous villains constantly trying to steal the (nonexistent) Krabby Patty formula only further boosts the mystique and fame of Krabs' lucrative burger brand.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Bad Guys (2022)_: The gang as a whole are revealed to be this at the end of the second act, when they're arrested for a crime they didn't commit. Professor Marmalade, who had been in charge of rehabilitating them, was really planning a master heist and setting up the Bad Guys to take the fall.

-   _The Princess and the Frog_:
    -   Naveen doesn't realize that Facilier and Lawrence were only using him to trick Charlotte into marrying Lawrence (disguised as Naveen) to get all Charlotte's money until the near end of the movie.
    -   Lawrence also qualifies. He likely doesn't even know that Facilier's endgame is to sacrifice a good part of the city to his Loa patrons. On top of that it's implied Facilier was not going to hold up his own end of their deal and take all the fortune for himself or at the very least take the majority of the money for himself.

The Evil Overlord's Affably Evil daughter mocks the eponymous protagonist for agreeing to a meeting with his enemies too easily, but quickly shuts her trap when its revealed he was prepared to kill them all with a LOT of carry-on explosives at the first sign of treachery.

-   In _Equilibrium_, John Preston turns over the entire leadership of La Résistance for a chance to see the Big Bad face to face and assassinate him. Except DuPont knew about this plan all along and arrested Preston as well. DuPont would have succeeded, except he took the time to gloat before killing Preston, triggering Preston's Unstoppable Rage.
-   Christopher Nolan's first film, _Following_ has two levels of Unwitting Pawns.

-   _The Hunger Games_: Katniss Everdeen. Present, lampshaded, and part of the symbolism. A mockingjay is a powerful symbol to the rebels, but it's also a bird that can't sing its own songs, relying on what others sing to it.
-   The Hovitos in _Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark_ were manipulated by Belloq into believing that Indiana was stealing their fertility idol and that Belloq simply wanted to protect it for them. They stopped Indiana from escaping with the idol and then attempted to kill him, during which time Belloq made off with the idol.

-   Everything that Morpheus does in _The Matrix_, since The One, The Prophecy, and The Oracle are all further systems of control of the humans by the AI's.
-   _MonsterVerse_:
    -   _Kong: Skull Island_: Both the soldiers and the LANDSAT scientists. Only Randa (and, to a lesser extent, Brooks and possibly San) had any idea what they were walking into, and he deliberately withholds that information until all of Packard's helicopters have been swatted out of the sky and most of their crews and the LANDSAT team are dead. The airdropped seismic charges were intended to flush Kong out (which worked out just _great_), and also awoke the Skullcrawlers. Brooks even protests before takeoff that they should warn Packard of what's really going on, only to be brushed off by Randa.
    -   _Godzilla vs. Kong_: Monarch (Nathan Lind in particular) and by extension Kong are this to Apex Cybernetics, as during the joint mission to enter the Hollow Earth with Kong, Apex are only using them so the corporation can harvest the Hollow Earth's energy source for themselves and power up Mechagodzilla. Apex in turn, with their sheer hubris, arrogance and stupidity, end up unwittingly bringing the threat of King Ghidorah back, reincarnated in Mechagodzilla, due to Apex integrating a power source they had absolutely no understanding of into the Mecha whilst using Ghidorah's still-telepathic skull as the core of the Mecha's **brain**, although it's a bit of an Ambiguous Situation whether Apex simply blundered into helping or were being actively manipulated by Ghidorah the entire time (with the novelization providing hints towards both interpretations). Speaking of the novelization, it reveals that Walter Simmons' right hand Ren Serizawa is a Dragon with an Agenda, who would've been in the perfect position to dispose of Simmons and become a Dragon Ascendant if not for Ghidorah possessing Mechagodzilla at that moment.
-   In _Mortdecai_, Charlie spends the first half of the movie as one, unwittingly smuggling the stolen painting to Krampf in his Rolls Royce after Krampf bribes his mechanic, Spinoza, into hiding it there without Charlie's knowledge.
-   Philip in _Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides_, who rushes back to Syrena as soon as he regains consciousness... and thus rewards Blackbeard with Syrena's tear and gets her tied up to die.

-   _Everyone_ in the _Saw_ movies is like this. The entire franchise is one giant incomprehensible Gambit Roulette, and all the characters are constantly walking right into Jigsaw's plans.
    -   Though inverted because Jigsaw genuinely wants the suckers to live; he doesn't expect them to make the wrong choice and die but he wants them to make the right choice and live, therefore he doesn't do Evil Plans. His successors and helpers, however, do seem to want everyone to die, and expect them to do dumb things — which they do. All the time.
-   _Sleepers_: Danny Snyder/O'Connor, the official lawyer of Tommy and John, didn't know at first what was going on. From his point of view, King Benny threatens him one day to take on the defense of two of his hitmen in a trial that would usually be a can't-miss case for the prosecutor. He was handed a script with questions for him to ask in court and ordered to play along and put in the effort to be at least a tad competent. As the trial progressed, it's possible he figured out the defending position had help from the inside, but it's never shown nor implied anyone revealed the truth to him.

-   _Star Wars_: Virtually _everyone_ in the Prequel trilogy is played like a fiddle by Palpatine.
    -   Mace Windu dies in an attempt first to arrest and then just kill Chancellor Palpatine, which is not only unsuccessful, but also provides Palpatine with ammunition for his claims that the Jedi are revolting against the Republic and SHOT FIRST. In a double irony, he also ends up making The Chosen One, who he himself had doubts about already, switch his allegiance to the man he attempted to "assassinate".
    -   In _Attack of the Clones_, Palpatine asks rhetorically what senator would be brave enough to propose the Republic create an army within earshot of the easily manipulated Jar Jar Binks, currently interim senator of Naboo. Always eager to please, and knowing that Padmé trusts Palpatine, Jar Jar does exactly that.
    -   Queen Amidala in _The Phantom Menace_ ends up getting Palpatine into power because Palpatine pretended to be on her side while openly criticizing senator Valorum, causing her to start a vote of no confidence and eventually get Palps elected.
    -   The entire Confederacy of Independent Systems are manipulated into declaring independence from the Republic by Dooku, who's working for Palpatine. The goal being to start the Clone Wars and get Palpatine emergency powers.

-   In a rare example of a villain being this to the hero, Lex Luthor finds himself being played by Supes himself during the climax of _Superman II_. Specifically, he believes he had depowered Supes when he had in fact unwittingly depowered General Zod and his co-conspirators.
-   It's strongly implied in _The Terminator_ that John Connor deliberately manipulated Kyle Reese into falling in love with his mother by giving him the picture of her. Reese was just allowed to be unaware that his own son was sending him back in time (to his almost certain death) to ensure he could be conceived and grow up to save humanity. It must've been a heartbreaking decision for John.
-   In the original _Total Recall (1990)_, Quade is his own unwitting pawn. He had his own memory wiped as part of his cover to infiltrate La Résistance and identify its leader.
-   _Touch of Evil_: Menzies is an honest cop who comes to the disheartening realization that his longtime partner and friend has spent years planting evidence and tricking Menzies into discovering it.
-   In _Twice Upon A Time_, Synonimess Botch tricks our heroes Ralph and Mumford into bringing him the mainspring from the Cosmic Clock, giving him control over time and the chance to cover the land of Din in nightmare bombs as part of his plot to trap the Rushers in waking nightmares.
-   _Van Helsing_: Dr. Frankenstein. He thought Count Dracula was helping him create his Creature because Dracula believed in his work. But once the Monster is brought to life, Dracula reveals he was solely using Victor so he could use the Monster's artificial life to bring his vampiric children to life.
-   In _Wanted_, the main character is played, especially through the charms of the hot chick. Who is played herself, along with everyone in the order. At the end, some of her "colleagues" decide going into business for themselves isn't such a bad idea, but she has the... balls to set things right.
-   In _White Noise_, once John begins experimenting with EVP (a way of listening to/seeing spirits in the beyond) on his own, he starts receiving messages from his late wife, believing them ways to save people. They're really trick visions sent by three very, very malicious spirits so that they can follow him and break into the realm of the living through the door he's opened up. And Anna's constant insistence that he 'Go now!'? Those were visions of when he arrived at the final location the messages showed him, where she was trying to warn him to get away and save himself. "Exactly as planned" indeed.
-   _Wild Things 2_: Maya King, Julian Haynes, Detective Morrison, Niles Dunlap, and possibly even Brittney's mother were all hapless pawns in Brittney's scheme to get rich. Terence initially wasn't a part of the scheme and almost becomes a Spanner in the Works when he tries to blackmail them, but ends up being framed for Maya's murder.
-   _Wonder Woman (2017)_: Ludendorff and Doctor Poison are manipulated into creating their gas weapon by Ares, who wants to use it to extend the war indefinitely.
-   _X-Men Origins: Wolverine_:
    -   The look on Wolverine's face when Blob told him that Stryker was performing experiments on mutants and when he realizes what led him to willingly get his brand spankin' new adamantium skeleton... priceless.
    -   Emma Silverfox becomes Stryker's hostage -> Kayla is forced to work for Stryker -> Kayla faked her death as a part of their plan -> Wolverine accepted Stryker's offer to coat his bones with adamantium to avenge Kayla's 'death' at the hands of Sabretooth.

    Literature 

-   In _American Gods_ Wednesday uses Shadow to start a war between the gods so they can conquer the new gods, when in reality, Wednesday and Loki just want the power they'll gain from a field of dead gods.
-   Isaac Asimov:
    -   _The Naked Sun_: Robots cannot be ordered to murder humans, but they can be accessories to murder, simply by ordering them to do highly specific tasks that they can't identify as being directly harmful. This happens with a robot that brings poisoned water to Hans Gruer (although Gruer doesn't die). And then the robot that handed a poisoned arrow to Bik, and the robot whose arm was used to murder Rikaine Delmarre.
    -   _Foundation Series_:
        -   "The General (Foundation)": General Bel Riose actually thought he would win and came close, but was inevitably called back to Trantor and executed on grounds of believed disloyalty. The pawn here is Emperor Cleon II, who could've trusted in his subordinate (although historical evidence said that he'd be betrayed sooner or later, and executing overly successful subordinates was the only way to survive).
        -   "The Mule": Ebling Mis begins searching for the Second Foundation in order to warn them before the Mule conquers their planet, too. Unfortunately, the Mule is present, calling himself Magnifico. Bayta figures it out early enough to stop Ebling from telling the Mule where they are.
        -   _Foundation's Edge_: Mayor Branno intentionally sends Trevize out to call attention to himself, hopefully acting as a lightning rod to distract the Second Foundation (which is one reason why she sent Compor to follow him in a less-effective ship).
        -   _Foundation and Earth_: Unaware of potential manipulations by R. Daneel Olivaw, the protagonists act as a Macguffin Delivery Service, bringing Fallom to him so that he can survive to see the creation of Galaxia.
-   _The Belgariad_: Errand is brought up to be totally innocent so he can sneak into the Rivan throne room to steal the Orb, without knowing what will happen afterwards. It turns out to be a subversion - Errand, or rather Eriond, is a God in Human Form who doesn't know it, which is why he can touch the Orb unharmed. He's guided by the Light Prophecy, who places him in Zedar's path at exactly the right moment as the start of a _very_ long game.
-   _Break of Dark_: Robert Westall's Short Story, "Fred, Alice and Aunty Lou", includes author Peter Wingfield, who plays into the hands of vengeful ghosts; giving them a conduit to the real world and the energy of his dislike for his old school-mate, Roger.
-   The Dale Brown book _Act of War_ has many characters play into National Security Adviser Robert Chamberlain's hands.
    -   _Shadow Command_ sees US President Joseph Gardner playing right into the hands of Russian President Leonid Zevitin. The former's egoistic desperation to control the protagonists leads him to steadily feed information that should have stayed classified. Fortunately for Gardner, he does not end up outliving his usefulness.
-   In Kurt Vonnegut's novel _Cat's Cradle_, Angela and Newt Hoenikker are suckered by agents of the American and Russian governments, respectively.
-   _The Chronicles of Narnia_: In _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_, when the White Witch accidentally stumbles upon Edmund, she subtly goads him into revealing everything about who he is and how he got to Narnia.
-   _The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant_ by Stephen Donaldson. Lord Foul is a Chess Master and Manipulative Bastard extraordinaire, and his plan to destroy the Land involves not just conquering everything, but continually engineering situations where the protagonists become Unwitting Pawns. Thomas Covenant is saddled with the role of Unwitting Pawn for the entire duration of the first and second trilogies, knowing that Lord Foul's plan hinges on the destructive and harmful actions he takes, but helpless to do otherwise because there are no good alternatives.

-   _Counselors and Kings_: Subverted in the last book. Kiva has released her former captor and Evil Mentor Akhlaur from his imprisonment with the intention of manipulating him into destroying The Magocracy of Halruaa and its King Zalathorm for her. Said manipulations across most of the book go off without a hitch. Then Kiva tries to convince Akhlaur to destroy his and Zalathorm's shared Soul Jar so they can fight it out evenly — and he all but laughs in her face. Seems for most of the book, Kiva had been "manipulating" Akhlaur into doing things he wanted to do anyway, but he's not about to put his immortality on the line for _anything_, even his own revenge and certainly not Kiva's, and he's far too powerful for her to do anything about it; Kiva has to go into a mad scramble to salvage something of her plans that _doesn't_ end with Akhlaur on the throne, and she fails to do so. This, people, is why Evil Is Not a Toy.
-   As Malacoda says to Shroud in _Dis Acedia_:
    
    A decent puppeteer can manipulate pawns, yes... but a true master pulls strings on string-pullers themselves.
    
-   _Discworld_: In _Thud!_, the entire quest Vimes undertakes has been engineered by the very politicians whom he thinks he's going to stop, to give them an excuse to make peace with each other, which is what Vimes wanted all along, except that he's been their unwitting pawn...
    
    You can't bribe Sam Vimes, but why bother when you can just pull the wool over his eyes?
    
-   _Doctrine of Labyrinths_: Felix thinks he severed his tie to Malkar years ago, as he continued to climb the Mirador's political ladder. Turns out that Malkar still has enough of a tie to steal Felix's magic for the destruction of the Virtu.
-   In _Dragonvarld_, the Sisterhood of Seth play this role. They think that their efforts are keeping Seth free of dragons, but they're actually only repelling all dragons except the one they unknowingly serve and whose predations the "attacking" dragons are trying to end.
-   Spartacus Kilroy in the first _Erec Rex_ book. He thinks he's just trying to help the sick King Piter get better. He doesn't realize that the coffee he's giving the king actually contains the poison keeping him ill.
-   _Flora Segunda_: In _Flora's Dare_, Flora is sent off by Lord Axacaya to Bilskinir House to recover Georgiana Segunda's Diario so as to determine how to free the Loliga. Little does she suspect that his primary reason for sending her was to confirm his suspicions that she's the last Hadraada, and thus have her killed.
-   _Goblins in the Castle_: Ishmael<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is eventually revealed to have tricked Igor into betraying the goblins, whom he thought of as friends, by having him be the one to invite them into a trap. This nearly gets Igor killed by the goblins after they're freed, but it's called off after the truth comes out.
-   In _Hunger_, the second book of the _Gone_ series, the Gaiaphage does this to Caine and Lana. Caine thinks he's messing with the nuclear power plant for revenge and power, and Lana thinks she's actually trying to destroy the Gaiaphage. It may also be doing this to Brittney in book 3. Drake is corrupt enough that he actually works for it willingly.
-   King James in _Harald_, who makes war on his father's allies on the advice of his Evil Chancellor, who is in the pay of the real Big Bad.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    
    -   In the words of the fake Mad-Eye Moody in _Goblet of Fire_, after having tricked Harry into winning the Triwizard Tournament just to lure him into the whereabouts of Voldemort:
    
    Decent people are so easy to manipulate.
    
    -   In the same book, we learn that Ludo Bagman was accused of spying for the Death Eaters during the First War; at his trial, he maintains that he was tricked into it and thought that his intel was going to the good guys. He was apparently telling the truth, since his suspicious actions in the present are unrelated to any of this.
    -   Ginny Weasley in _Chamber of Secrets_, though she eventually becomes suspicious and tries unsuccessfully to destroy the diary.
    -   Harry Potter himself in _Order of the Phoenix_, when Voldemort tricks him into going to the Department of Mysteries by making him believe falsely that Sirius Black was in danger. Especially notable given that he tells Snape (who at this point he believes loyal to Dumbledore) that he'd had the vision of Sirius in danger there, and still rushes in to do the Dark Lord's dirty work for him (in fact, Sirius dies _because_ he goes there to aid Harry and is killed by Bellatrix).
    -   Ultimately, almost every major character in the series is revealed to be, to some extent, pawns for either Dumbledore or Voldemort (or _both_). It's ultimately revealed that their decades-long game of wits to destroy each other is effectively the central keystone of the series. Harry himself is the ultimate piece in the game, being played by both sides at various points. Snape, however, is a willing pawn for Dumbledore.
    -   Horace Slughorn is the main reason Dumbledore needed to come up with such a complex plan to defeat Voldemort in the first place. Voldemort, a student at the time, played up his "eager young star student" act to goad Slughorn into revealing some crucial knowledge of how Horcruxes are made. Horace actually realized later in life that he had been a pawn and that he was thus indirectly responsible for a great deal of harm, and edited his own memories out of shame.
-   _A Hole in the Fence_: A benign example. Brigadier Beauras is the chief of the police squad tasked with keep people (usually just nosy teenagers) out of the Forbidden Zone. Nonetheless, Beauras does not know what lies beyond the Zone either, and after several years he is getting sick of watching over who-knows-what only because his superiors said so. One day, Beauras spots main character Grisón trying to (badly) crawl into the Zone, and he is about to drag him out of the shrubbery when he comes to a realization: He cannot run the risk of getting fired by snooping around, but the kid is risking barely anything. So, Beauras allows Grisón to sneak into the area, catches him when he is sneaking out, and lets him go with a scolding and a warning after subtly getting answers out of him.
-   _Honor Harrington_:
    -   The People's Republic of Haven under the Legislaturalists, who were secretly Mesan alpha lines. The Mesans set up the entire inefficient government, and before the coup effectively controlled the PRH's policies. It's hinted that the majority of the Legislaturalists were unaware of the Alignment's existence, by the way.
    -   The entire Solarian League and its navy. The Mesan Alignment has several well placed naval officers in its pocket, up to and including the _fleet admiral_, allowing them to basically send whoever they want wherever they want. They use this power to set up a war between the League and the Star Empire of Manticore. Standout among their pawns is Admiral Josef Byng. Where every other Solarian officer they used was at least being bribed and/or blackmailed, Byng was just useful as an anti-Manticore bigot. They put him into position and let his personality do the rest.

-   _In Death_: William from _Rapture In Death_ doesn't even know that his wife, Reanna The Sociopath, has manipulated him in more ways than one to help her commit murder.
-   _Jaws_: Three of the four selectmen helping Vaughn put pressure on Brody have no idea about how Vaughn in being driven by criminal connections and think they're just doing a favor for an old friend or protecting local jobs.

In fact, he wants to use the shell to steal all the Aura from Spectraland and return to Earth with godlike powers. Joel and Felicity don't learn the truth until they've helped him take the shell.
-   In several works by Stephen King, Randall Flagg, aka the man in black, sets forth plans of conquest almost completely dependent on the efforts of Unwitting Pawns.
-   Amara in _Knowledge Of Angels_\- even though the orchestrator of the plot is not the villain, the plan does end up causing the death of a main character, as Amara has technically proven his guilt in rejecting God.
-   In Tad Williams' _Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn_ series, this role is amply filled by King Elias. From the start, Evil Sorcerer Pryrates tricks and manipulates him via promises: first, to communicate with his dead wife, and later, to grant him Immortality, all while turning him into a vessel for the return of the Big Bad Storm King.
    -   Ironically enough, Pryrates is an even bigger Sucker. The Storm King manipulated him with the promise that Pryrates would be the "first among men" when The Storm King returned. And he was the first...to die.
    -   The entire cast of protagonists are suckers, by the classic definition, as the most basic element of the Storm King's Evil Plan is to trick them into bringing him the Three Swords. It works perfectly.
-   _The Mental State_: Zack enlists several of these over the course of the story. His most noteworthy examples are Charlie, who is used to threaten the inmates who have children, and the entire rapist population of the prison, who are tricked into doing hard labour and then have the crap beaten out of them for their efforts.
-   _Mistborn_: In the original trilogy, everyone is an Unwitting Pawn for Ruin and its plan for complete... ruin. And in true Chess Master spirit, that's not even the end of it it, since Preservation made a Unwitting Pawn out of Ruin by making humans in ITS plan for offing Ruin. DANG. For the record, "everyone" includes the Big Bad _and_ The Chessmaster. No mind goes unscrewed.
-   A heroic case in _Noob_. Big Bad Tabris was initially created by scientists from the Empire, but rebelled against them. However, upon his creation, certain objectives were implanted into him. They includes fiding more rosaphir, the limited resource that the Empire needs to fuel its technology instead of the abundant but not completely reliable magic. In the fourth novel, his biggest move had the side effect of doing just that, indicating he's still guided by these objectives to an extent.
-   _The Pendragon Adventure_: Poor Mark and Courtney. Every time they try to help out Bobby and his friends, they usually just end up playing into Saint Dane's hands.
-   Kronos does this to _everyone_ in _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_. Furthermore, especially in the second book of the new series, _The Heroes of Olympus_, many characters, among which the Big Bad herself, state that Percy will be Gaia's pawn, and that he'll bring about the destruction of the gods.
-   In the Robert Ludlum novel _The Prometheus Deception_, Nick Bryson is an operative for the Directorate, a top-secret division of the U.S. government. Five years after his forced retirement, he's tracked down by the FBI director who informs him of the truth: The Directorate was founded by the KGB, Bryson's parents were killed to set him on this path, his foster "uncle" an enemy operative and even his beloved girlfriend was in on it. Every single mission he risked his life for and felt proud of actually was working against U.S. interests and thus his entire life has been one grand lie to be used by the enemy.
-   In _Rogue_, Chad asks Kiara to give him a bike tour of the town and pick up some things for his sick brother along the way. He's actually using her to buy Sudafed from a bunch of different pharmacies so his parents can make meth.
-   In _The Saga Of Billy_, Vetherr, the Betrayer, god of Creatures and Necessity, has created every race of monsters, hoping that one of them will be able to topple mankind's dominion over the world. If his creations have a mind of their own, even those that decide to oppose him power him through their birth and existence. Similarly, any being who would undertake a difficult but necessary endeavour will inconsciously pray to Vetherr, including those who want nothing but protecting their loved ones from his schemes.
-   In _The Silmarillion_ and _The Children of Húrin_, Húrin ends up as one after he is released by Morgoth. Driven mad by 28 years of Mind Rape he ends up unwittingly leading the enemy to the Hidden City of Gondolin, causes a civil war and the ultimate destruction of the last free tribe of Men, and sets events in motion that lead to the fall of the largest kingdom of Elves, all in an attempt to avenge his family's deaths . He only stops when Melian _tells_ him that he's not helping anyone, and effectively acting as a tool of Morgoth's malice. Then he kills himself.
-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire_, EVERYONE is this to Petyr Baelish. By various schemes and plots, he deepened the conflict between Stark and Lannister families, which escalated with Ned's execution. This got the North to take arms against the king, which started an entire war for the Seven Kingdoms. That's just in the first book. And he's not even _nearly_ done. Even Tywin Lannister, Olenna Tyrell and Roose Bolton, Magnificent Bastards through and through, are all just another piece in the game.
    -   To Littlefinger, or to Varys. Varys pushed Cersei towards paranoia so she would think every competent adviser who dared criticize her bad decisions to be a traitor and plot their demises. All so the Targaryen prince he hid away can reclaim the Iron Throne.
-   In Stephen Marley's book _Spirit Mirror_, Chia Black Dragon tries very hard to dodge Nyak's plan by taking a third option. She fails, and ends up releasing Nyak from his can. Then in the next book, _Mortal Mask_, she does it again.
-   Harry Harrison's _The Stainless Steel Rat_. Jim diGriz discovers that the government of the planet Cittanuvo is building a Warlord class battleship under the pretense that it's just a transport ship. After investigating, he finds out that two elite criminals tricked the government into building the ship with the intent of stealing it and using it for interstellar piracy.
-   _Star Wars Legends_:
    -   When Grand Admiral Thrawn from _The Thrawn Trilogy_ is involved, characters become suckers by being so afraid that they play right into his hands through their caution, the best example being that when they need a certain device from one of two locations, they leak info that they will go to one, therefore showing him they are actually going to the other. Some characters in the _Hand of Thrawn_ duology are wary of doing _anything_ lest they be doing what he wants.
    -   The Rebel clones in _Galaxy of Fear_. They're friendly enough, if kind of vacant, and tell our heroes to stay around, their leader is out right now but he'll be back soon and they should meet him. Turns out their leader is a Darth Vader Clone. But they have no idea that he should be their enemy—he's the one who gathered the skin and hair samples they were created from, and they have no memories about what being a Rebel means or what the Empire is.
    -   In _Dark Lord—The Rise of Darth Vader_, rather than capture the fugitive Jedi quietly, Moff Tarkin allows them to slip past an Imperial checkpoint in their disguised stolen shuttle, so that when they land on Kashyyyk he can accuse the Wookiees of harboring fugitives as a pretext to invade the planet and round up thousands of Wookiee captives — perfect slaves for his Death Star project.
    -   The _Jedi Academy Trilogy_ reveals that the lead scientist responsible for designing the Death Star and Sun Crusher has no idea that they were used to destroy inhabited planets and star systems, believing them to be intended for large-scale mining projects. Justified in that she was brutally conditioned as a child to take a For Science! view of her work and not think beyond it.
-   _The Three Worlds Cycle_: In the final book, Ian Irvine attempts to stop the main villain from using the most powerful magic in the world to take over said world by destroying the power sources of all magic, thus preventing anybody from using it. Except it turns out that the magic the Magnificent Bastard was using was the only one powered by something else, and what she had actually done was destroyed any and every chance the heroes had of stopping him. Whoops.
-   _The Traitor Son Cycle_: Jean de Vrailly is trying to save the kingdom of Alba under the advice of his guardian angel. Predictably, the angel is not what it says it is, and it's playing de Vrailly like a fiddle for its own purposes.
-   _Tower of Somnus_: Anna Donnst didn't realize until the literal last minute that she was just her mother's patsy. The whole time, when she thought her mother was "trusting her to get the job done," was just Belle distancing herself from a scapegoat.

-   _View from Below_: Iris believes sending mortals to the Below is the only way to defeat the Crimson God, as per Peter's instructions. She doesn't realize that Peter is actually working for the Crimson God and that he witheld important information about how to actually weaken the mad deity. This means every mortal who fights the Crimson God is doomed to fail and die as yet another sacrifice to revive him.
-   Under the advice of his dead wife's spirit and Big Good Kil'jaeden, the old orc shaman Ner'zhul in the _Warcraft_ novel _Rise of the Horde_ convinces his people to put away their differences and prepare to defend themselves against the Draenei. Except his wife's ghost was an illusion, Kil'jaeden is The Devil and this book is the Start of Darkness of the orcs that explains how they became the Always Chaotic Evil horde of the first two games. Oops.
-   Most of the Blood Angels in James Swallow's Warhammer 40,000 novels _Deus Encarmine_ and _Deus Sanguinius_. Sachiel in particular; Inquisitor Stele thinks how easy he is to manipulate, and when he realizes at last the corruption, Stele kills him, declares the loyal Blood Angels did it, and starts a battle.
-   In the _Warrior Cats_ novel _The Forgotten Warrior_, Sol shows up in ThunderClan for a visit and Firestar decides to let him stay for a bit, despite his evil acts. Later, when Lionblaze is on patrol, Onestar, leader of WindClan shows up and tells the ThunderClan cats to drive out Sol, which they had already been planning to do. However, since Onestar told them to do it, doing so would make ThunderClan look subserviant to WindClan and weaken it, so they are forced to ally with Sol against Onestar rather than driving Sol out.
-   _The Wheel of Time_: The entire point of Elaida is to further the plans of the Forsaken by either doing what a servant says or just being an idiot.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _24_, **everyone** takes turns being the Unwitting Pawn, up to and including Jack Bauer. Somehow even the Big Bad will end up a sucker either in his own scheme or be Out-Gambitted by the good guys. It's not a good idea to play Jack Bauer for a sucker though, 'cause that will only make him mad.
-   The _entire cast_ of _Angel_ in Season 4. They spend a whole whack of time chasing down Jasmine, hoping to free the world from her version of lovey-dovey mind-control. At the end, their victory is entirely spoiled when evil law firm Wolfram and Hart contact them saying how happy they are that they've averted instant world peace. Nearly everything they had done in the past seasons had led to Jasmine's rise to power to begin with. Ironically, in the next season, the entire Wolfram and Hart becomes a sucker when Angel fools its higher-ups into thinking he is corrupted. And for giving him the means to do it, as a reward.

-   Bradford in Season 2 of _The Apprentice_ did the same, waiving his exemption, and was immediately fired SOLELY because he was an idiot. This is a rare example of someone becoming the victim of their _own_ Batman Gambit. Bradford wanted to get rid of the terribly ineffective team leader, Ivana, but knew that he wouldn't be brought back into the boardroom since he had immunity; therefore he surrendered it so that she'd bring him back. Unfortunately, he didn't consider what the other possible outcome of that decision might be...
-   _Arrow_: As Season 6 carries on, it becomes clear that the apparent new Big Bad, Cayden James, only went on his Roaring Rampage of Revenge against Team Arrow because someone else manipulated him into it by framing Oliver for killing James' son. Halfway through the season, this turns out to have been James' own supposed underling, Ricardo Diaz, who used James' rampage as a cover for eliminating key officials in Star City so that they can be replaced with bought off patsies, giving Diaz control of the city. Diaz kills James when he's no longer needed.
-   In _Babylon 5_, this is how Ambassador Londo Mollari gets revenge on Lord Refa, his erstwhile ally, for his deadly political maneuverings. Londo makes it appear as though he is laying a trap for G'Kar to leave sanctuary at Babylon 5 so he can arrest him and thus gain political favor, and makes sure that the information is leaked, knowing that Lord Refa will try to undermine the plot by reaching G'Kar first so he can imprison and kill both G'Kar and Londo. However, the real trap is different: G'Kar was in on it the whole time and the guards were loyal to House Mollari, meaning that this Unwitting Pawn just walked into his own death trap, via No-Holds-Barred Beatdown from a group of angry Narns while a lively gospel song plays.
    -   Unfortunately, Londo's attaché and friend Vir is also something of an Unwitting Pawn during the scheme; even though he wasn't a victim, he had to believe the fake version of the plot because there were telepaths involved, and the information had to appear genuine. He wasn't happy to be made a fool of.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Pearl and Nash were pawns of Twilight. And they were none too happy when they found out.
    -   Roden in Twilight's real grand scheme.
    -   Genevieve to both Twilight and Roden.
-   In the fourth season finale of _Chuck_, it's revealed that every major plot point that has happened since the pilot has been part of a bigger scheme, with Chuck and possibly everyone involved with those major plot points as the unwitting pawns. Whose pawns, exactly, and in what game, has yet to be revealed.
-   _Doctor Who_: Companions have unwittingly aided the villains before. In fact, the revived series sees the Doctor himself doing it. Examples of this include:
    -   "Dalek": Henry van Statten and Rose Tyler are this to the Dalek, the latter more directly because neither of them has any way of knowing just what it is, and how dangerous. Van Statten's Smug Snake nature doesn't help either.
    -   "The Long Game", in which the Ninth Doctor leaves Satellite Five after defeating the Monster of the Week, without bothering to help guide humanity back onto a "proper" path. By the time he returns 100 years later in "Bad Wolf", things have actually gotten worse, since he was playing into the hands or, more accurately, plungers of The Man Behind the Man.
    -   "The Christmas Invasion", in which the Tenth Doctor manages to cause the downfall of Harriet Jones by whispering "six little words" in her assistant's ear. It was stated during the Ninth Doctor's reign that she would be the "architect of Britain's Golden Age", but the power vacuum left in her wake seemingly allowed the Master to gain power and eventually become Prime Minister. This indicates that the 10th Doctor _did_ change history in "The Christmas Invasion", and worse, he changed a timeline he had previously talked about in glowing colors. There was supposedly a deleted scene explaining the entire concept. Russell T Davies, the writer of the episodes and then-showrunner, mentioned this in his _Doctor Who Magazine_ column as an idea he'd had, and that as far as he was concerned it was the case — **but** also said he had never scripted it, let alone shot it.
        -   This was somewhat alluded to in "The Sound of Drums", where Vivien Rook tells Lucy Saxon that her husband first became "real" (and subsequently launched the Archangel network) around the time of Harriet Jones' fall. How much of it can be attributed to the actions of either the Master or Tenth Doctor, however, is unknown. He does seem to blame himself for the Master's return by "The End of Time", as when Wilfred Mott tries to console the Doctor by saying it wasn't his fault, he sadly replied, "Isn't it?"
    -   "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End": It turns out that _everyone_ has been manipulated by Dalek Caan, who, having become a Mad Oracle after being exposed to the Time Vortex, seemed to lack the ability to pull this off. This especially extends to the Supreme Dalek and Davros, who, while having different opinions of the usefulness of Caan's information, don't realize that he intends to destroy the Daleks until it is too late to stop him.
    -   The Daleks are admittedly pretty good at suckering the Doctor. In "Victory of the Daleks", the Daleks use the Doctor's hatred of the Daleks and love of Earth to not only create _five_ retro-style Daleks (a net gain of two), but also for once, survive the events of the episode.
    -   In "The Pandorica Opens", the Doctor goes to the Pandorica when it opens to see what's inside... only to realise he's been suckered by every alien in existence and it is in fact him that's meant to go inside the Pandorica in order to stop the TARDIS exploding. Needless to say, it does anyway. "The most dangerous warrior in the world" indeed.
    -   In "The Doctor's Wife", it is revealed that the Doctor has been being manipulated for a very long time by the TARDIS, who was waiting for a Time Lord crazy enough to try and steal her so she could see the universe. The Doctor protested that he chose her because someone had left the door unlocked. The TARDIS, briefly able to speak, replied that of course "someone" had.
-   _Dollhouse_: Paul Ballard gets suckered into finding a way into the Dollhouse to rescue Caroline, thereby distracting all the security measures, while Alpha puts his actual plan into play and cheerfully sacrifices Ballard to DeWitt's not-so-tender mercies.
    -   And at the end of Season 2, it's revealed that Boyd Langton is secretly the head of Rossum and has been manipulating _everyone_ at the Dollhouse all along.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   House Stark's entire conflict with the Lannisters was instigated by Littlefinger, who used the values of both houses to move them against each other (The Starks' Honor Before Reason and the Lannister's Might Makes Right ethos, though the Lannisters comprise of schemers and chessmasters). This war cost the Lannisters a lot of money and thus made them inherit a debt-ridden Kingdom, and then turn on each other when their Puppet King dies and Tyrion is accused by his own sister with his father's acquiescence.
    -   Catelyn Stark was a victim of Littlefinger's, which hit her hard, as her impulsive reactions to an assassination attempt against Bran with a dagger that belonged to Tyrion and her credulity to an engineered letter sent by Lysa Arryn are two of the major reasons why her house sparks the war with the Lannisters.
    -   At various points, Sansa Stark is this to the Lannisters, the Tyrells, and Littlefinger across Season 3, where without her knowledge, leave alone consent, she is traded as a match, ultimately becoming Tyrion's wife. This is merely the pretext, it turns out that Littlefinger allied himself to the Tyrells and arranged for Joffrey's assassination. Sansa, through a Littlefinger stooge, Ser Dontos, carries a necklace which contains poison and as Tyrion's wife is close enough to be seated on the wedding dais that Olenna could reach her, collect the poison and pass it to Joffrey's cup at the opportune moment. She is "rescued" by Ser Dontos and Littlefinger from the wrath of Cersei, who has put a large bounty on her head.
    -   The Three-Eyed Raven was aware of what created Hodor and brought Bran to the past Winterfell apparently to witness the child Ned departing to the Eyrie, but in reality brought him to cause Wylis' mind-loop into Hodor, which happened immediately after Ned left. Though this has cruel overtones, had it not happened, Hodor would not have brought Bran to North of the Wall in the first place safely, nor he would have ultimately saved his life, for the moment foiling the White Walkers. Had it not been for this point, it would have been an entirely Senseless Sacrifice.
    -   The Master Torturer clearly had no idea what kind of game Ramsay was playing, or what role he gave him.
    -   For all his intelligence, experience and ruthlessness, Tywin Lannister falls prey to the same mistake Ned Stark did; he trusted _Littlefinger_ and raised him to a position of supremacy in the Riverlands and allowed him to marry the widowed lady of the Vale, making him arguably the second most powerful man in Westeros besides Tywin himself. In return, Littlefinger killed Joffrey with the Tyrells, in part because Tywin got Catelyn killed and partially because it would plunge the Seven Kingdoms into yet more chaos, which was a goal he stated aloud to Tywin and kidnapped Sansa Stark from Kings' Landing, giving Littlefinger an avenue for control of yet another of the Seven Kingdoms... and Tyrion discovers that his predecessor's supposed "magic" at financing the Iron Throne was really _heavy_ borrowing from the Iron Bank of Braavos, an entity which even Tywin doesn't dare cross.
    -   Cersei Lannister. After transforming the Sparrows into the Faith Militant and giving them free riegn to imprison any _deviants_ towards the Gods, which ends up getting both Loras and Margaery captured, Cersei confidently assumes that she is controlling them like puppets. It never occurs to her until it's too late that the now all-powerful fundamentalist organization would imprison her for her own deviant lifestyle once they no longer needed her.
-   In _Glee_, Sue gets Brittany to give her the set list for New Directions, but Brittany has no clue about what she's going to do with it.

-   _House of Anubis_ has Eddie and KT. They were manipulated by the villain into believing that the Staff of Osiris would stop Ammit from being unleashed. They only learned too late that it did the opposite. Eddie's vision didn't help...
-   In _House of Cards (UK)_, Francis Urquhart uses as many people as he can for his own political gain — be it reporters, colleagues or even the prime minister. He makes sure to have as many people in his pocket as possible so that they can be made useful when needed. If anyone goes against him or can be of benefit when their public image is ruined — he will destroy them. Murder is not out of the question.
    -   This applies for _House of Cards (US)_, the American version,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  as well.
-   _Juken Sentai Gekiranger_: At the end of the series, Evil Overlord Rio goes down with a Villainous BSOD when he finds out that his entire life has been masterminded by Manipulative Bastard Long.
-   _Kamen Rider_:
    -   Averted in Kamen Rider OOO, if it was played straight, Eiji would have just been used by Ankh as a means of farming Cell Medals. IF it was played straight that is... Instead, Ankh explains why he needs him, which was not a good move on his part, as it leads to Eiji refusing to transform when Ankh needed him to in episode two, and in the next episode, the tables turn and Ankh is forced to do what Eiji says or else he will throw away his Transformation Trinket.
    -   And in _Kamen Rider Wizard_, it gets played straighter than straight. Yes, it's another instance of Evil Mentor having a massive hand in this trope, though what sets said mentor apart from the others was that he's not only the Big Bad, he was setting up not just Haruto himself, but the _entire Phantom race_. See, his plan involves using Wizards to power a ritual, but in order for Wizards to be created, they need to hit their Despair Event Horizon, but come back before they fully cross it. He already had one Wizard in the form of Haruto, but he needed to get other Wizards. This is where the Phantoms come in, as they are able to get these people to cross the horizon with the intended goal to make even more Phantoms. Needless to say, once his commanders find out about this, their reactions ranged from being unable to comprehend the idea of being used to downright plotting against him.
    -   In _Kamen Rider Gaim_, Mitsuzane discovered this out the hard way when the villains he had been "manipulating" for his own plans are actually the ones manipulating him all along. This was further lampshaded by Ryoma Sengoku/Kamen Rider Duke after he dissects the Golden Fruit from Mai, then came along the No-Holds-Barred Beatdown being dished out on Micchy.
    -   _Everyone_ in _Kamen Rider Build_ to Evolto. He needs to purify and gather the 60 Fullbottles, repair his Evol Driver, and get Ryuga to Hazard Level 5 so that his body becomes a suitable vessel for him in order to accomplish his plan of destroying the world. Thus, for ten years he sets up Japan's three divided states, with the help of Nanba Heavy Industries, to go to war with each other, so that they'll purify the Fullbottles for him as part of their military research, as well as gather them all together for him. When one of the researchers figures out too much, he has his memory wiped and starts directing his amnesiac identity, Sento, to become a superhero, so that he'll still continue purifying Fullbottles. He also sends Banjou his way, allowing the two to bond together, thus giving Ryuga a motivation to raise his Hazard Level. Even when Sento figures out he's being manipulated, Evolto exploits the heroes' heroic tendencies so that they keep doing things that further his plans. By Episode 35, he's succeeded in accomplishing _all_ of his above-stated goals and is just short of "destroy the world" on his to-do list.
        -   In an unexpected turn of events, Sento manages to completely invert this by taking all of the energy Evolto had managed to gather after doing all of the above and using that power to combine two Earths that'll create a completely new world where neither the divided states _nor_ Evolto himself exists at all.
-   The "rich and powerful" marks Nate Ford mentions during the opening credits for _Leverage_ are usually these. At some point along the way, their Mooks will often fall to this trope or Elliot, whichever one hits first.
    -   The team usually ends up making their targets into unwitting pawns, but they themselves end up as the Suckers (briefly) in "The Ho-Ho-Ho Job." They quickly caught on to the fact that a hacker has set up a scam at a local mall that will net the credit card numbers of nearly everyone who makes a purchase, and realize the only way to stop it is to cut the trunk line. They do so... only said trunk line also enables the security measures as the local branch of the Treasury, which was the hacker's _real_ target.
-   In _Lexx_, captain Stanley Tweedle's backstory, in which he was supposed to deliver what amounted to blueprints for the emperor's superweapon to the rebel forces, and instead ended up providing the emperor with the codes to deactivate the rebel's planetary defenses. The rest of humanity in the Light Universe were pawns as well, to the point that they willingly fed themselves to the Big Bad when he demanded it.
-   _Lost_
    -   Poor John Locke is now the **king** of this trope. In the course of the last seasons he has been a pawn used by a supernatural being who apparently planned Locke's whole ordeal, his reputation as someone "special" and then his final sacrifice so that he could take John's form and ultimately kill his own enemy, Jacob. The sheer number of episodes in which this Gambit Roulette at his expense has unfolded makes him something of an Unwitting Pawn Marathon Man. Also, Ben manipulated him into blowing up the submarine.
    -   He also kept juggling Idiot Balls, Villain Balls and Conflict Balls all throughout the series, while every single flashback has portrayed him as a gullible loser. It's a testament to Terry O'Quinn's acting that, in spite of that, he has consistently been one of the most interesting, popular and badass characters of the show.
    -   For a devilish Manipulative Bastard and a supposedly wise ageless man, Ben and Richard too came across as total dupes; Locke, Ben and Richard, The Three Stooges?
-   In the _Merlin (1998)_ series, multiple characters (Arthur, Merlin, Guinevere) end up as Mab's suckers at one point or another.
-   _NCIS_: In 6.21, "Toxic", Abby builds a biological weapon without knowing what it is.
-   _Next (2020)_:
    -   Next buys Ted's cooperation using various new technologies and blackmail material, but ultimately was only using him to get itself captured by the NSA and taken to a server farm compatible with its software.
    -   After the bombing at the task force headquarters, Ben reaches out to his dad, who happens to be the Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence, for advice. Unfortunately for him, his dad's advice is geared towards acquiring Next for the government, rather than destroying it, and thus Ben ends up at cross purposes with the rest of the team.
-   _Once Upon a Time_: Belle was completely manipulated by Regina/The Evil Queen into trying to depower Rumplestiltskin with True Love's Kiss. Rumplestiltskin flips when he realizes that she can take away his powers, assumes that Belle is working for Regina, and tells her to leave. Poor Belle honestly wasn't working for Regina, but the Queen wins either way — either Rumple is depowered, or she can abduct Belle and use her as a trump card against Rumple at a later date. (She instead tells Rumple that Belle is dead _and_ abducts her, so she not only has a trump card but has one that Rumple would never expect.)
-   _Orphan Black_: DYAD is good for setting these up. One of the biggest ones is their former mole, Delphine, who Rachel manipulates into unknowingly helping with the abduction of Kira.
-   In the last episode of Season 3 in _Person of Interest_ it is revealed that the entire group of Vigilance was this for Decima. Decima created the group solely so Vigilance would out Northern Lights to remove the competition for their Samaritan project, then Decima framed Vigilance for a terrorist bombing to get the US Government to hand over the feeds to make Samaritan operational. After that, Decima then uses this to wipe out Vigilance when they have outlived their usefulness.

-   Though she was fairly bad to begin with, Kai Winn in the final episode of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ certainly seems to fulfill this role to Gul Dukat's Chessmaster.
-   _Supernatural_
    -   Both Sam and Dean Winchester have played right into the villains' hands, making the apocalypse possible. Grief\-stricken Dean's Deal with the Devil leads to him going to hell where he finally gives in to the offer to torture others to spare himself, breaking the first seal holding back Lucifer. Similarly screwed in the head, Sam is seduced to the The Dark Side by Ruby just enough to get him to kill Lilith, which they all expected to prevent the last seal from being shattered; in reality, she _was_ the last seal. What neat little bookends, guys.
    -   Castiel's extremely straightforward nature, unfortunately, leaves him rather easily manipulated by other characters, as he doesn't usually anticipate that someone will lie to him. Metatron takes full advantage of this in Season 8 and manages to trick Cas into helping him with a spell to cast all of the angels out of Heaven. Castiel is horrified when he finds out the truth.
    -   It's also implied that Castiel was this for much of Season 4. Despite his personal doubts, it seems he just trusted that Heaven was giving him the right orders until he somehow found out that Heaven had been planning the Apocalypse all along. And it's never stated whether his superiors eventually revealed it to him, expecting him to go along with it, or if he figured it out himself.
    -   Sam becomes this again in Season 11, when he prays to God for help and receives visions that he believes are God trying to give him hints. It turns out he _is_ receiving supernatural visions (not just having weird dreams), but that they're actually from _Lucifer_, as a ploy to get him to come back to the Cage in search of a way to defeat the Darkness. Sam initially performs exactly as expected, but then point-blank refuses to become Lucifer's vessel again, even though it could help defeat the Darkness. Unfortunately, Sam is no longer the only suitable vessel...
-   _Survivor_
    -   A lot of Suckers have come and gone, but Erik Reichenbach from Micronesia stands out. In what many considered to be the dumbest move in the show's history, Erik gives away his Individual Immunity and is promptly voted off by the conniving female alliance, after being conned in a transparent ploy for redemption.
    -   The _Samoa_ season was **full** of Unwitting Pawns. Most of Foa Foa and almost _every_ member of Galu, _except_ Brett and possibly Kelly and Monica, fell into this trope. Knowing that Kelly was just brilliantly blindsided, Monica saw the writing on the wall and just decided to antagonize Russell in the end, and Brett was _fully aware_ that he couldn't have won because he lost the final immunity challenge. Is it any wonder Russell did so well, what with all the suckers who were practically lining up for the slaughter? (Players would have voted him out _way_ sooner... or dragged his arrogant ass to the end and made him take all the nasty shots from the angry jury as Natalie did.)
    -   Russell pulls this off _again_ in _Heroes vs. Villains_, this time using Tyson to break up what should have been a foolproof plan to get either Russell or Parvati out of the game by tricking him into switching his vote to Parvati, which broke up the even distribution of votes that Boston Rob's alliance would have used to get either Russell or Parvati out depending on who Russell used his Hidden Immunity Idol on. Instead, with Tyson's vote switched to Parvati, she now has four votes to Russell's two... and Tyson's three. Russell gave the immunity idol to Parvati, and bye bye Tyson.
-   Chris, Victoria and Allison Argent in _Teen Wolf_, along with the rest of the hunters, have no idea that they are just enabling Gerard's plot to become a werewolf in order to survive terminal cancer. The ultimate however is Jackson, who does not even remember transforming into the Kanima, much less the murders that it commits at the direction of Matt.
    -   Throughout Season 3B the Nogitsune plays the rest of the cast like a fiddle, using its possession of Stiles to win their trust. The best example comes in "Letharia Vulparia", where the Nogitsune spends an entire episode impersonating Stiles, with Scott not doubting him for a second.
-   Nick Hanway in _The Thick of It_. The spin doctor is convinced that the appointment of a new Prime Minister will also require a new chief spin doctor, but he _seriously_ underestimates Malcolm Tucker...
-   _Van Helsing (2016)_: Sam is manipulated by the Oracle into becoming the Fourth Elder under the belief that he'll become the new Dark One. Instead, he's used as a portal to free her, which kills him.
-   _The Villains of Valley View_: In Season 1, Hartley is this to Oculon, who poses as a student named Declan to use her crush on him to get closer to Amy and the Maddens to turn them in to Onyx.

    Podcasts 

-   Cecil of _Welcome to Night Vale_ cheerfully reports the obviously bogus coverup stories concocted by the City Council with little to no indication that he doesn't believe every word. Also, choosing not to question what one is told seems to be the only way to survive living in Night Vale.
    
    "Ignorance may not actually be bliss, but it certainly is less work."
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Hunter: The Vigil_: This is a constant danger. It can be pretty hard for Hunters to tell the difference between the good-ish supernaturals and the true villains, and they often get suckered into working for the latter. For example: Division Six is a group of mage-hunters being used by a Seer of the Throne as his private hit squad, the Knights of Saint George are serving the agenda of an Abyssal entity, the Inquisition is run by a ghoul, Les Mysteres are run by the Pure, and so forth.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Lim-Dûl the Necromancer was a powerful sorcerer that terrorized Ice Age Terisiare with his magic and undead armies, but was ultimately a tool for the wills of the beings he gained his power from — the spirit of Mairsil the Pretender, who inhabited Lim-Dûl's Ring of Power and slowly poisoned his mind in order to use him for his own plans of vengeance, and the planeswalker Leshrac, who saw Lim-Dûl as a valuable minion and intended to use his undead army for his purposes. Eventually, Leshrac asserted full control and made sure than Lim-Dûl had no delusions about who precisely he served.
-   _Ravenloft_ runs on Paranoia Fuel, so this is so common in adventures it's almost more of a Plot Twist when it _doesn't_ happen.
-   _Warhammer_: It's strongly implied that Bretonnia's whole "Cult of the Lady" religion is a complete sham, set up by the Wood Elves who dwell in the forest in the south of the country so they have a nice, easily-manipulated buffer zone to protect them from the world. _The End Times_ reveals that, yes, the Lady is actually the Elven goddess Lileath.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   The Adeptus Mechanicus is all but stated to (knowingly, in the case of the higher-ups) worship the Void Dragon as the Omnissiah (rather than an aspect of the Emperor). The C'tan being on par with the Chaos Gods in terms of Big Bad and the Mechanicus being responsible for humanity being able to travel the stars and defend themselves, this is as bad as it sounds. This also leads to a lot of enthusiastic Mechanicus dropping in on tomb worlds, waking up the Necrons as they poke around, and the next thing you know there's yet _another_ system or two lost to the Imperium.
    -   Read the introduction to any Imperium-centric story carefully for a nice bit of horror: _It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor of Mankind has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the master of mankind_ _**by the will of the gods**_. What Gods do they mean by that? It could just be a figure of speech, but...

    Theatre 

-   Fittingly, many characters wind up as pawns in _Chess_. It all culminates in “The Deal (No Deal)”, a song that’s essentially just ten minutes of Walter and Molokov manipulating the entire cast.
-   _Jesus Christ Superstar_ portrays Judas as a man who unwillingly advanced the agenda of Caiaphus and the Council, as well as fulfilling prophecy.
-   _Othello_: Iago manipulates everyone in his vengeful goals, leading to, as is the case with a Shakespeare tragedy, multiple deaths.
-   _Thrill Me_ has the moment where Richard finds out that Nathan has been lying to him about basically everything since the murder, including when Richard thought he had the upper hand. In fact, Nathan's masterminding is the reason they got caught. Yes, getting caught was part of Nathan's plan.

    Toys 

-   In _BIONICLE_, Makuta Teridax used the entire universe as his pawns. The goal of the Toa Mata was to reawaken Mata Nui, put into a deadly coma by Makuta himself. Knowing that they will succeed because it was their destiny (and since Mata Nui's death would cause the end of the world), he manipulated nearly everyone he came across and lead his Brotherhood of Evil with an Evil Plan whose exact details he kept to himself. Long story short: his manipulating ensured that he would have enough time and be in the right place to commit a Grand Theft Me on Mata Nui when the heroes awakened him, thereby becoming the ruler of the universe.

    Video Games 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   _Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney_': Poor Klavier Gavin gets used as an unwitting accomplice _twice_ by people he trusts. His friend Daryan used him as a drug mule for a smuggled Borginian cocoon, and his brother Kristoph used him to frame Phoenix Wright for forged evidence that Kristoph himself had actually commissioned, much to Klavier's horror when Apollo reveals the plots in court.
    -   _Trials and Tribulations_ has Pearl Fey, who is manipulated into triggering the events of the final case by her mother, Morgan Fey. While Pearl thinks she's just following her mother's orders for Maya's sake, her actions are actually the means to _kill_ Maya. Luckily, the plan isn't fulfilled thanks to a third party who knew about it beforehand.
    -   In _Trials and Tribulations_' flashback cases, Dahlia Hawthorne uses several. 3-4's defendant was their fall guy in a fake kidnapping scheme (and later for the murder of their other accomplice), the victim of case 3-1 was someone they got close to because he was a chemistry student and could get them access to poison, and Phoenix Wright himself was to unwittingly carry a decisive piece of evidence away from the courtroom, disguised as a present.
    -   _Justice for All_ has the third case where Franziska performs a surprise search on Acro's room, which forces him to hide the murder weapon on his person. Franziska only did the search because of Gumshoe, who in turn brought the idea of the search due to Edgeworth suggesting it to him and knowing Phoenix would be the defense attorney on the case. This turn of events causes Phoenix to correctly guess that the murderer hid the weapon at the bottom of his wheelchair and under the blanket he wears over his legs. Franziska loses and is flabbergasted that she, a perfectionist, made a mistake and curses herself for conducting the surprise search. In actuality, she was just the unwitting pawn to Edgeworth, who helped Phoenix catch the true killer without him even knowing it.
    -   Edgeworth himself gets a taste of this in the second _Investigations_ game, where it turns out that the reason he's had to solve so many murders in such a short timeframe is because Simon Keyes had goaded their personal enemies into committing murder, and then pointed Edgeworth in the right direction to catch the immediate culprits without realizing who was the ultimate instigator.
    -   Sebastian Debeste in the same game gets a particularly painful version. He's a good kid, if a little dense and not quite up for his job, but he trusts his father, Blaise Debeste, and that person uses that trust to gain access to important evidence (which he then destroys) and to obfuscate investigations via Sebastian's incompetence. Blaise even refers to him as a "pawn that isn't user-friendly" when trying to break him mentally just to get him to leave the room.
-   _Ace Combat_:
    -   In _Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War_, near the end of the war, warmongers in both Osea and Yuktobonia try to keep the war going, unaware that a group of Belkans called the Grey Men were playing them like fiddles in revenge for the fall of their homeland. They didn't care and worked well together instead, going against the Razgriz's peace coalition.
    -   Princess Rosa Cossette d’Elise in _Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown_, had been manipulated by a group of young Erusean officers called the Radicals into declaring war on Osea over the construction of the Lighthouse, under the belief that it represented encroaching Osean Imperialism on the continent of Usea. In reality, the Radicals were looking to use their drone army that they developed using technology that they got from Belka in the hopes that they would be able to restore Erusea to its former glory. When Rosa finds out the truth, she defects to the Oseans to put a stop to their plans.
-   _ANNO: Mutationem_: Ryan went missing shortly after receiving an anonymous N540 lead sent to him from C, who planned to capture and use him to lure Ann into a trap to use a dimensional device in order to retrieve an Artifact of Doom.
-   _Assassin's Creed_ has _many_ of these throughout the historical stories, but The Reveal at the end of _Assassin's Creed III_ is that the entire Assassin-Templar conflict throughout history was _both_ sides being the Unwitting Pawns of Juno, and the historical story of that game concludes with the reveal that Connor had been Juno's Unwitting Pawn for over a decade.
    -   Word of God on _Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag_ is that Olivier Garneau alone "_does know who his bosses are_" — namely, Abstergo Entertainment being a Templar front — while "_most people at AE just work for Templars without even knowing it_."
    -   By the time of _Assassin's Creed Rogue_, Mélanie Lemay has been made aware of the Templar order, as she gets inducted during the course of the game.
-   The majority of the plot of _Atelier Iris 3_ concerns three quirky teenagers trying to find eight gemstones so they can open a book which will grant any wish, while helping the even-more-quirky townsfolk with their problems. What could go wrong? How about nearly causing The End of the World as We Know It because you were manipulated by an evil spirit from (almost) the very beginning into wasting the only wish you get?
-   In _Batman: Arkham Asylum_, once Dr. Young creates the Titan formula, she discovers she was funded by the Joker, who proceeds to use that mutagen to create chaos. The Viral Marketing Alternate Reality Game also has a case when the player is contacted by The Riddler, who thanks you for compromising Arkham's entire security system, making the island takeover that much easier and effectively setting up the events of the game. Nice Job Breaking It, Hero.
-   The premise of _Battle Garegga_ revolves around the Gadgeteer Genius Wayne brothers, who produce highly advanced military machines for the federal government in exchange for riches as part of the contract. When the government goes on a rampage of conquest, the brothers discover that the very machines they developed for the government are being used for such malicious acts, and set off in their secret Super Prototype aircraft to destroy the machines they helped create.
-   The player character in _BioShock_. However, this is justified, as the player character is being mind-controlled by Atlas/Fontaine from the very beginning, so he had no control over his actions. At least, until Dr. Tennenbaum snaps him out of it.
-   BioWare loves this one to death:
    -   In _Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal_, your whole party is this, killing off the other Bhaalspawn for Melissan's scheme to ascend to power.
    -   _Knights of the Old Republic_, anyone? You're the ex-Sith Lord? Captured, mind-wiped by the Jedi Council, and with Bastila holding your leash. Metaphorically True statement on par with Obi-Wan and his "certain point of view."
        -   Although made by Obsidian instead of BioWare, the player character from the second game counts too. In this case, they more or less _know_ Kreia's got them on a leash and is shamelessly running her own agenda, but a cross of Force Bond, Sith assassins (led by her former apprentices) on your tail, and _no one_ giving you a clear answer as to why this is all going on means the Exile has little choice but to keep letting Kreia hold the leash. Kreia also uses the rest of the party, recruiting them through blackmail or More than Mind Control so they go along with the Exile...who is still on Kreia's leash. It's Kreia's game, you're just holding the controls because she wants it that way.
    -   _The protagonist_ in _Jade Empire_. "Magnificent" indeed.
    -   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, the Dwarf Noble origin story has the player character's exile come about as a result of becoming an Unwitting Pawn in a particularly vicious piece of dwarven politics.
    -   In _Dragon Age II_, Hawke becomes an Unwitting Pawn of Anders, a _party member_ in a scheme to start a war between the Templars and Mages; to be fair to Hawke, Knight-Commander Meredith, the leader of the Templars, gets suckered just as effectively. Since _Dragon Age II_ is Darker and Edgier than other Bioware games, the scheme _works_ regardless of Hawke's actions afterwards.
    -   In _Mass Effect_, so many of them. Notably Saren Arterius and Matriarch Benezia for the Reapers. Commander Shepard is an interesting case, as they voluntarily ally themselves with the Illusive Man despite his questionable morals, but can also turn on him and screw over his plans in the Paragon ending of _Mass Effect 2_.
        -   And in _Mass Effect 3_, as brilliant as he was, the Illusive Man was no match for the power of the Reapers and ended up being their pawn.
-   _BlazBlue_:
    -   Tsubaki is used as a pawn by Hazama many, _many_ times over. He has manipulated her into fighting her best friends Jin and Noel by inspiring feelings of jealousy and inadequacy, telling her that she was meant to be with Jin and Noel took her rightful place at his side. As a bonus, she's also obstructing Takagamagara's surveillance by using the Izayoi, and she serves as a sort-of hostage to Hakumen, who has feelings for Tsubaki because he's Jin from another timeline and watched her die there. As for Tsubaki, she follows the NOL's (and by extension the Imperator's, and by extension Hazama's) orders loyally. This continues through to the end of _Chronophantasma_, when the mind control Hazama puts her through is broken and she becomes one of the good guys. It's worth putting down that although Litchi is also working with Hazama, she is _not_ this trope. She's advancing his evil agenda knowingly, because he has Arakune.
    -   In a supreme bit of irony, Terumi and Relius were also the pawns of someone who they believed was _their_ pawn: Imperator Saya, who was the host of Izanami, the goddess of death. She ditches them the moment they stop being useful and puts in motion her own plans to create a "world of death".
-   In _Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2_, General Shepherd is revealed to have set up a five-year gambit to pit the USA and Russia against each other, so that he may lead the USA to the status as permanent ultimate world power, and be known worldwide as a "hero" for it... and he doesn't give two shits over how many millions of innocents get in his way. The man made all of the US, UK, and Russia into his Unwitting Pawns, including the player characters, one of whom (Allen) ends up as the reason Russia declares war after Makarov pulls an Uriah Gambit on him, and another (Roach) whom Shepherd kills himself after sending him to retrieve the evidence that would have exposed him as the mastermind behind the plot. Even though Price and Soap managed to kill him, it's not stated if Shepherd's plan has already succeeded. Hints suggest that it did. The third game subtly reveals that Shepherd was also this to Makarov, who had been feeding false information to the former and had actually caused Shepherd's Start of Darkness via the nuke detonation that he ordered. And, if what Makarov's actions in "Persona Non Grata" are taken into account, then he was planning to have General Shepherd killed anyway. Having Price and Soap do it was simply convenience.
-   _Castlevania_:
    -   _Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia_ has Shanoa seeking out the three pieces of Dominus, a glyph that is to be used on a particular artifact that, according to Barlowe, will bring about the defeat of Dracula when destroyed. Only after meeting certain conditions that allow you to bypass the bad ending do you learn that said object actually _resurrects_ Dracula, as Barlowe demonstrates after Shanoa refuses and defeats him in a boss battle.
    -   Leon Belmont and Sara Trantoul (and even Walter Bernhard) in _Castlevania: Lament of Innocence_. Our man Drac practically lives (unlives?) off of Unwitting Pawns. Trevor, Simon and Richter Belmont have also been pawns in his or Shaft's, in Richter's case plans for resurrection.
    -   Celia Fortner in _Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow_ tried this on Soma, and depending on the ending, either succeeded or failed. The former ends up with Soma killing her anyway.
    -   In _Castlevania: Lords of Shadow_ Gabriel _and_ Zobek are the Unwitting Pawns of Satan in his bid to obtain the power of the Mask of Shadows to overthrow Heaven.
-   _Celestial Hearts_: Edgar Gravehart works with Lilith in exchange for the latter reviving his wife, but Lilith never intended to uphold her end of the bargain at all. She just wanted to drain the energy of living beings, including her sister Helen.
-   Serge of _Chrono Cross_ _defines_ this trope. The guy can't go to the bathroom without furthering someone or something's plans. The fact that everyone's plans revolve around him trying to get out of someone else's gambit does not help. Here's the short version: First, Lynx manipulates him into coming to Fort Dragonia so he can steal Serge's body and release the lock on the computer system FATE (which Lynx is a Wetware Body for). The Dragon Gods and Harle get him to kill FATE to release the seal on their power, then merge into their original Eldritch Abomination\-ish form and start work on annihilating all human life. Except that _all of this_ was planned by Balthasar, because only by awakening the Dragon Gods would it be possible to create the Chrono Cross, which is the only thing that can save Schala from Lavos's hold over her. Confused yet?
-   Practically _everyone_ in the _Chzo Mythos_ is an Unwitting Pawn in some way. Practically a testament to how incredibly good Chzo is at this Magnificent Bastard business.

-   Alex of _Code 7_ ends up being one. S.O.L.I. and Code 7 can't leave Schrödinger Station, so they corrupt his core program and make him create a fake anti-virus to successfully get to earth. Zoya of Episode 1 also believes to have been one.
-   The Global Defense Initiative (okay, mostly Boyle) in _Command & Conquer: Tiberium Wars_ walks _right_ into Kane's Gambit Roulette, and their only hint that they were even hit by it is when the Scary Dogmatic Aliens arrive. The expansion pack then explains that Kane specifically planned for Boyle to be the only surviving GDI leader after the nuclear strike on the Philadelphia _specifically_ because Boyle is easily predictable. If you play the Scrin campaign, even the Scary Dogmatic Aliens are suckers in Kane's roulette.
-   Several in the _Danganronpa_ series:
    -   _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_:
        -   Makoto in Chapter 1. The whole point of the trial is Naegi trying to clear his name in Sayaka's death, as she was killed in his shower. They'd switched rooms for the night, but nobody else is inclined to take him at his word for it. What's interesting is that he was framed by the victim in her own failed attempt to murder someone else — Makoto is only cleared because even the _murderer_ fell for Sayaka's trick and thought he was in Sayaka's room, hence thinking the shower was locked (girls' showers have locks, boys' don't) instead of faulty and jammed shut.
        -   The murder plot in the third chapter depends on the killer tricking someone into becoming their accomplice by proposing a plan where both parties kill someone and each act as an accomplice for the other's murder, thus allowing them to graduate together. Unfortunately for the accomplice, the _actual_ plan had the accomplice being lured into a secluded room and murdered after they'd done their job. Celestia even admits that it was pretty obvious that she was planning to dispose of Hifumi from the start, but he trusted her and after she told him Kiyotaka had raped her and stolen Alter Ego, he was too blinded by rage to think clearly.
    -   _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_: Teruteru and "Byakuya" (actually the Ultimate Imposter) are the Unwitting Pawns of Nagito. Nagito sent a note warning "Byakuya" of his murder plot to get "Byakuya" to host a party in the old dining hall then got himself assigned cleaning duty so he could set up a murder plot. Then he allowed Teruteru to discover what he's doing, confesses and tells him his entire motive. He managed to entice "Byakuya" to set up the Locked Room Mystery Nagito needed in a room which goes completely dark in a blackout and gets Teruteru to try and murder him, starting the Killing Game. He didn't intend for "Byakuya" to die, however; the Ultimate Impostor proved quicker on the uptake than Nagito expected.
    -   _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_: The fourth trial sees the true murderer get away scot-free even after their plot is uncovered because they used a pawn to do the actual dirty work (which would of course make the person unable to graduate, but they weren't planning on graduating with this plot), so the official Blackened was the pawn. Kokichi Oma used a Flashback Light in the virtual reality to get Gonta to fall into despair, and then convinced him to kill Miu Iruma (who was planning on killing Kokichi) and graduate so the other students would be killed (telling Gonta it was a Mercy Kill because the outside world was so terrible). The other students are furious with Kokichi for forcing them to execute Gonta, but they can't really do anything to him.
-   The trope comes up a few times during the course of the _Dark Parables_ games. In the third game, the villain turns out to be one for Snow White's Wicked Stepmother's equally evil magic mirror. The detective is one in the fourth game; the Big Bad needs an artifact from a shrine that she's not allowed to enter, so she simply waits until the detective goes in to collect it.
-   _Dark Souls_:
    -   The Player Character is this in _Dark Souls_. No matter what you do, by beating the game you're just a pawn in an Ancient Conspiracy and Forever War regarding whether the Age of Fire should continue or end. Though at least the ending that _isn't_ an And I Must Scream scenario gives you the chance to be something other than a mere pawn.
    -   In _Dark Souls II_, the protagonist is the pawn of Shanalotte. From the opening cutscene to the very end of the game, Shanalotte had been guiding/aiding/manipulating the Bearer of the Curse to free Drangleic from Nashandra and Link the Fire. She only begins to admit her role in everything near the end of the game.
-   _Diablo_: This trope is played painfully straight when the player character gets possessed by Diablo. Downer Ending for sure.
    -   Even more so _Diablo II_: The entire game is the tale of how Marius gets manipulated by Baal into rescuing his soulstone from destruction at the hands of the player character, escaping the fate that his brothers suffered. Poor Marius dies in asylum cell as the horrible truth comes crashing down on him.
    -   _Diablo III_: Diablo's unwitting pawns? _Everyone_. Except Adria, who wasn't unwitting, and may not have actually been a pawn.
-   Captain Gordon (**Defender of Earth!**), from _Disgaea_, thinks he is sent to defeat you in order to defend Earth, but soon discovers he's being played like a piano by his superiors and that his mission is merely a pretext for an invasion of the Netherworld. Trumping that is General Carter, who himself was played like a fiddle by Archangel Vulcanus, who really wanted the Netherworld razed as part of his ploy to become a god. He (_along with everyone else in the plot_) was being used as a tool to fulfill Seraph Lamington and King Krichevskoy's combined Gambit, and had no idea how bad his own scheme fell into the puzzle until the curtain fell — on him. HARD.
-   _DoDonPachi_ presents itself as your usual "human military vs. alien invasion" Vertical Scrolling Bullet Hell shooter. That is, unless you unlock the 2nd loop and your commander reveals that the "mechanized aliens" he had you think you were fighting were actually _your own comrades_ that he tricked you into destroying, then declares his intent to kill you with his special forces.
-   _Double Homework_: Unlike the protagonist, whom Dennis enlists for the same purpose, Henry is completely unaware that Dennis is using his voice recordings in order to catfish unsuspecting girls and women over the internet.
-   _Dragon Age_: The plot of act 3 involves Anders playing Knight-Commander Meredith like a fiddle in order to spark open war between the mages and templars. The _only_ reason the plan worked is because Meredith could be counted on to respond to _any_ provocation by beating on the nearest mage she can find.Her decision to Annul the Gallows in response to Anders blowing up the Chantry is absolutely _ridiculous_, since Anders wasn't _from_ the Gallows in the first place. But the fact that she could and did do it made mages everywhere realize that the Templars could not be appeased and they had no protection against some insane fanatic like Meredith deciding that they all needed to die for no reason whatsoever, causing mages everywhere to rise in open rebellion against the Templars, just like Anders always wanted.
-   _Dragon Quest_:
    -   In _Dragon Quest IV_, Psaro the Manslayer was being manipulated by Aamon all along: he pretended to be his loyal second-in-command while exploited Psaro's hatred towards humans and love towards Rose to turn him into a mindless killing-machine and then usurp his position as "Master of Monsters".
    -   _Dragon Quest V_:
        -   The Winter Queen feds Dwarf Dwight the lie that Queen Treacle kicked his grandfather out of Faerie Lea so he steals the flute of the Herald of Spring, which will impede the end of the winter season.
        -   Queen Dowager was easily manipulated by the bad guys into throwing Coburg into turmoil by getting rid of her stepson Prince Harry and putting her reluctant son on the throne.
-   Inuart in _Drakengard_. He submits to the Big Bad's mind control to become The Dragon, attains the power to sweep Furiae off her feet and defeat Caim, so finally she _has to love him_, right? Well, he forgot that the Big Bad's plan was to kill her, and predictably realizes this too late to do anything.
    -   It gets worse in the lead-in to Ending Four, where, after the Gods die and he gets everything he wanted as a result... he decides, apropos of nothing, that it's up to Furiae and him to become the new gods and finish their plan to destroy and recreate the world. This entire route being something of a bizarre Mind Screw...It's not clear whether the giant flying man-eating babies are related to this, or just a consequence of the Gods being dead, although the game more implies the latter. Yes, really. Giant killer babies.
-   In _Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara - Daggerdale_ it's revealed at the very end that your questgiver was The Starscream to the Big Bad Rezlus, and she had you kill Rezlus so she could take over the tower for herself.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   In general, _Elder Scrolls_ protagonists have this happen to them frequently. Thankfully, the only manipulators who you can't get bloody revenge against in these games are the untouchable Daedric Princes, and they at least compensate you for your work with cool artifacts.
    -   Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Prince of Destruction, is said to be one by Haskill, the chamberlain of Sheogorath, in an obscure text. Haskill describes Dagon as "the pawn of every Prince of true power, the dupe of every schemer in the Nineteen Voids." Essentially, whenever one of the other Powers That Be in the setting wants to accomplish something that involves destruction of some sort, they get Dagon to do the heavy lifting, and thus they pass all the blame on Dagon who is already widely considered a God of Evil.
    -   In the series' backstory, Barenziah, while she was Queen of Morrowind, was one to "the Nightingale" (who was either _Arena_ Big Bad Jagar Tharn or his agent, Drayven Indoril, sources are unclear). The Nightingale used her attraction to him in order to acquire the Staff of Chaos. She would, however, work to make things right, using Jagar Tharn's attraction to her in order to get close enough to him to decipher his notes and send them as clues to the people working against him.
    -   _Morrowind_:
        -   The Nerevarine gets hit with this especially bad. In the main game's main quest, there is evidence that you are this to the Daedric Prince Azura. Depending on your interpretation of events, there is no true "Chosen One", merely people who could be, and she has shoe-horned you into that role in order to cast down Dagoth Ur and the Tribunal. This happens again in the _Tribunal_ expansion, where one member of the depowered Tribunal, Almalexia, has gone insane from the loss of divine power and is trying to get you killed by giving you an increasingly difficult series of quests which cross the Moral Event Horizon and just keep going. Whether your character is aware of this or not isn't elaborated upon, but you have been asked to go along with it by the King of Morrowind regardless. When the villain finally resorts to taking you out personally, she goes into a long monologue about how nutty she is and how stupid you are.
        -   In the backstory, St. Veloth was the legendary Chimer mystic who led his people away from the decadence of the Summerset Isles to their new homeland in Morrowind after receiving visions from the "Good" Daedra (Azura, Boethia, and Mephala). Given their other actions and propensity toward manipulation, it is very possible that they deceived Veloth into leading The Migration of the Chimer for their benefit only.
    -   _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_: In the _Dragonborn_ DLC, the titular antagonist, Miraak, turns out to have been one for Hermaeus Mora, Daedric Prince of Knowledge and Secrets. Miraak is allowed to mess around in Solstheim with his plot to mind-control the natives into creating temples that will allow him to escape Mora's realm of Apocrypha because said manipulator knew that 1) this would create a threat that the current Dragonborn (you) and the Skaal couldn't ignore, and 2) Miraak could not be defeated without his help. He gets away from the DLC with everything he wanted; the secrets of the Skaal, a new champion (you) to replace his treacherous old one (Miraak), and revenge on the Skaal and Miraak for trying to cheat him.
-   _Eternal Darkness_ has a more unique example than some: the villain. Pious Augustus has been spending two millennia working to bring his Ancient into reality, which would tear humanity a new one if it arrived, and the protagonist of the game must put an end to the threat. However, there are three timelines of Pious doing this, each under a different Ancient, with him also taking steps to subdue a fourth Ancient, Mantorok. Unfortunately for Pious, this is just what Mantorok needs him to do, in order to enact his own plot to eliminate the other three Ancients entirely by merging the three timelines into one at the end.
-   In _Fable II_, the protagonist spends his entire LIFE trying to stop the Big Bad Lucien from rebuilding an ancient tower of magical doom. Once Lucien is dead, Theresa, who guided him through this quest, reveals that she was just using Lucien to rebuild the spire and using you to defeat Lucien so she could claim the spire herself.
-   In _Fallout: New Vegas_ the reason that you're told to try and keep President Kimball and General Oliver alive if you're working for Mr. House or Yes Man is that after the NCR gets the boot from Vegas their citizens will be quick to blame them for waging a costly and unpopular war while still capable of being on decent enough relations with Vegas to do trade.
-   _Fate/stay night_ has Shirou and Rin being pawns in the schemes of Gilgamesh and Kotomine in all three routes, with Shinji joining them in Unlimited Blade Works.
-   The _Final Fantasy_ series. Multiple times.
    -   _Final Fantasy IV_: First Cecil delivers a trapped ring to the village of Mist (which, is known as the "Bomb Ring" in some versions). Then later he's approached with a Hostage For Macguffin deal, and he hands over the macguffin (assumed at the time to be the last one Golbez needed) before seeing the hostage. Then he and his group have the door to the second-to-last Underworld crystal opened because of some disturbance inside, and end up giving Golbez a way in. And _then_, after failing to secure the (seven!) lost Crystals, they go and unseal the door to the last one, and trudge through the Scrappy Level both ways to bring it outside, only for Golbez to re-control Kain and take it at the last second. And if you include the crystal that he retrieved for Baron in the backstory, that makes him directly responsible for Golbez getting fully _half_ of the Crystals. Sometimes, you wonder why Cecil keeps doing things, considering that the situation gets worse every time he gets close to a macguffin.
    -   _Final Fantasy V_:
        -   Bartz and his companions head into the Great Forest of Moore, in order to stop Exdeath from taking what's sealed inside. Turns out _he_ waited for them to get to that world's crystals... And destroy them. Wow.
        -   Bartz and Krile go to seek Ghido for help after Exdeath is defeated and the worlds fuse together and at that point, an innocuous-looking splinter that Krile has enables Exdeath to return. Having overheard the conversation, he sets out to take control of the Void.
    -   Terra and her comrades fall for this _hard_ when the Empire in _Final Fantasy VI_ insists that it wants to commence peace talks. Granted, a few party members are suspicious enough to prepare a backup plan, but Terra, Locke, and General Leo swallow the plot hook-line-and-sinker and deliver a whole bunch of Espers for Kefka to turn into Magicite. Worse, this enables him to enter the Esper World and raise the Floating Continent, where the Warring Triad are hidden away. It turns out that Emperor Gestahl was also a Unwitting Pawn: Kefka uses him and the Empire to get to the Triad, and then uses their power to kill him and take all of it for himself.
    -   Cloud from _Final Fantasy VII_. One of the main points of his character is that Sephiroth can make Cloud do anything by manipulating him just the right way, and he makes sure Cloud knows it.
        -   All of the Deepground members from _Dirge of Cerberus_ are this to Professor Hojo. After his death in the original game, he ends up digitalizing his mind into the worldwide network and later possesses Weiss, as well for his final, final experiment, the revival of Omega.
    -   Queen Brahne Raza Alexandros XVI from _Final Fantasy IX_ thought she was behind everything but it turns out she was just a pawn of Garland and Kuja as they manipulate her war and greed to fulfill their own objectives.
    -   Tidus and Yuna from _Final Fantasy X_. They get bounced like ping-pong balls back and forth between Yevon's plan to continue the spiral of death and Auron's plan to destroy it and free Spira. _Final Fantasy X-2_ seems to imply that Yuna, at least, _never figured it out._
    -   By the time _Final Fantasy XIII_ rolls around, the main group is being _told_ that they're Unwitting Pawns.
        -   And in the sequel, it comes up again when Noel kills Caius, destroying the heart of Etro, killing her with him, ensuring his plan succeeds. The most infuriating part is that _Noel and Serah already knew this_ but Remembered Too Late.
    -   Almost _everyone_ ends up this way in _Final Fantasy Tactics_ after the dust has settled from the Gambit Pileup by the story's end. Except Delita. And Ramza..
-   Sigurd, the protagonist of _Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War_. He starts a border war to rescue a friend who was captured by a neighboring prince and ends up conquering that whole country. From then on, the corrupt nobles of his homeland, Grannvale, use him to conquer another neighboring country so that they can cement themselves as The Empire. As soon as Sigurd's conquered the last castle, Grannvale declares him and his family traitors and he's forced to flee, utterly disillusioned with his country and his own foolishness. Even his efforts to clear his name serve someone else's agenda, as Lord Arvis places his political rivals in Sigurd's way and waits until the bodies are done falling—then he tricks Sigurd into laying down arms and murders him.
-   _God of War 3_, reveals that throughout all three games, Kratos was an unwitting pawn of Athena, who used his thirst for revenge to kill all of her threats to power, which are basically the other Gods, especially Ares and Zeus. She watches Kratos kill them all, so she can rule over the humans as the one true God and to take possession over Hope so that she will have complete control. Hope being in the image of a little girl, which reminds Kratos of his daughter helps him finally snap out of his Roaring Rampage of Revenge and realize what is happening in time to stop her.
-   _Golden Sun_:
    -   _Golden Sun_ and _Golden Sun: The Lost Age_ have Alex, who uses both parties as Unwitting Pawns. While they fight amongst each other about lighting the lighthouses Alex twiddles his thumbs for when they finally do and cause the Golden Sun to rise and shine down massive power down on Mt. Aleph, where he happens to be waiting.
    -   Only to discover that he _himself_ was the Wise One's Unwitting Pawn in his plan: he knew lighting the lighthouses would allow someone to gain enough power from the Golden Sun to conquer the world, so when all but one of the gems required to light the lighthouses was removed from their chamber, the Wise One transferred just enough of that power (which was originally split evenly between the gems) from the remaining gem to Isaac without telling him, meaning that if the lighthouses were all lit, anyone who wanted the Golden Sun's power would not get enough of it to conquer the world.
    -   And in _Golden Sun: Dark Dawn_ it's shown that he one-upped The Wise One, and is doing the same thing again. He's so good at this that in his very first appearence, he even says to the characters they're pawns, and they can't do anything about it. By the end of the game, it's clear that he's been using almost everyone of importance throughout the whole plot. And the player still doesn't have the slightest idea what his long-term goals are, as he remains The Unfought.
    -   Subverted in Agatio's intro scene in _The Lost Age_, in which he flat-out tells Alex to his face that he knows he's being used, and _just doesn't care_ as long as his goals get accomplished, too. Agatio's otherwise one of the flattest major characters in a series known for flat characters.
-   General Morgahn during much of _Guild Wars: Nightfall_. Once he learns the truth about Varesh, however, he helps defeat her and joins the player character's team as an NPC. The PC also spends a fair bit of time being this during various schemes in _Guild Wars: Prophecies_.
-   In the original _Guilty Gear_, after you defeat the sub-boss, Testament, he reveals that this was all part of his plan, since he can now use his blood to awaken Justice.
-   Gordon Freeman and Adrian Shephard in _Half-Life_. We don't exactly know what the plan is but that G-Man keeps laughing at us.
-   Jacket from _Hotline Miami_ never learns who is really behind the phone-calls which are assigning him missions to murder members of the Russian Mafia en masse, nor does he know how his killing-sprees play a role in 50 Blessings' plot to ignite a nuclear war between the USA and Russia.
    -   Phone Hom (the telecommunications company which is seen in "Neighbors" and "Prank Call") also serves as one of these; they are the ones who send out the recorded messages to the 50 Blessings hitmen. Apparently, their systems are bugged and they aren't even aware that it's happening.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_ has it happen in essentially every game:
    -   In general, this is the way The Heartless operate, acting as mooks for people with strong but wicked hearts and corroding their resistance to darkness by proximity, eventually allowing the Heartless to turn on their former masters and steal their powerful hearts to be turned into powerful Heartless.
    -   The first game has Riku, Maleficent, and the other Disney villains as the pawn of Ansem, Seeker of Darkness, who plays a long con to get Riku to give in to the power of darkness enough to allow Ansem to steal his body while Maleficent gathers the seven pure hearts he needs to reach Kingdom Hearts.
    -   _Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories_ spends almost its entire plot on Sora playing into the hands of Organization XIII's plans to brainwash him into their servant by gradually modifying his memory.
    -   _Kingdom Hearts II_ has Sora duped by the Organization again, this time in that their plan relies on him killing as many Heartless as possible so that they can collect the hearts released and build a second Kingdom Hearts. This one means that he's been playing into their hands for all three of the prior games.
    -   _Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep_ being a prequel where all three of the main characters are Doomed by Canon, it shouldn't be a surprise that they spend the entire game being thoroughly manipulated by Master Xehanort and Vanitas, Terra being the biggest sucker of them all. Whether Xehanort or Vanitas was the pawn of the other depends on which one you think was stronger at the end of their respective gambits.
    -   _Kingdom Hearts 3D \[Dream Drop Distance\]_ reveals that every hero and every villain in all of the games before this was the pawn of Xehanort, with all of his previous failures having been part of one big Gambit Roulette. This includes Xehanort being a pawn of _himself_ courtesy of a Stable Time Loop that he used to set up the roulette.
    -   _Kingdom Hearts III_ reveals that all of the above was set up by the Master of Masters and his apprentice Luxu, known today as Braig/Xigbar and the original wielder of Xehanort's Keyblade, who together planted the idea in Xehanort's head of forging the χ-blade and walked him through every step of creating it. There's no indication that Xehanort ever knew the truth.
-   Kirby himself (and the other player characters, if you use them) in _Kirby's Return to Dream Land_. Once you beat the apparent final boss (though anyone familiar with the series would know otherwise as there's _always_ a True Final Boss), it turns out that it was actually a Big _Good_ and that the person you've been helping all game is the Big Bad...and manages to retain the usual surprise by giving you a boss stage even if you haven't reached True Final Boss levels.
-   _Last Scenario_, in its grand quest to break RPG plots, couldn't possibly leave this one alone. However, unlike most of the tropes it targets, it's not subverted — it's exaggerated. Not only is Hilbert doing exactly what the Kingdom wants him to do for the first half of the game, he was set up as a hero _purely_ for this purpose. The entire Heroic Lineage spiel was lies, and in falling for it hook, line, and sinker, Hilbert was doing exactly what they wanted.
-   Ironically subverted by Raziel from the _Legacy of Kain_ series. Throughout all three games, every character is constantly waving this in his face, telling him how he has no idea what his true purpose is, and that he's just been their "unwitting pawn" the whole time. In the end, their manipulations buy him time to figure out his actual destiny, which none of them had ever guessed, thus making all of the villains the suckers in their own Gambit Roulette.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_. Throughout the first half of the game, Link ventures across Hyrule, gathering the three Spiritual Stones which will allow him access to the Master Sword and the Sacred Realm... only to allow Ganondorf to get in and grab the Triforce in the process!
    -   Link has a tendency to fall victim to this trope. In _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_, he accidentally lifts the seal that keeps Ganon's power sealed, in _The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords_ he releases Vaati from his prison by pulling out the titular sword, and in _Oracle of Ages_, he moves a sacred rock that is supposed to keep Veran from getting close to Nayru. Every time this trope happens, it's because Link is following the orders of Mission Control, who's supposed to be on your side but every damned time just ends up having you go help out the enemy. Although, to be fair for Link in _The Wind Waker_, Ganondorf pretty much had him trapped in a Morton's Fork, anyway; while the Master Sword does act as the seal for the last of his dark power, it's also the only thing that could defeat him. So, either Link doesn't take it, and Ganon's not gonna be beaten at all, or Link does take it, and Ganondorf gets his full power back while the Master Sword is powerless.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds_: Link is this to Hilda. He goes about rescuing the Sages and eventually getting the Triforce of Courage under her direction supposedly just so he could defeat Yuga-Ganon and rescue Zelda. Turns out that Hilda actually wanted to take all three pieces of the Triforce in order to replace the Lorulean Triforce that was destroyed ages ago, and she had Yuga kidnap Zelda for the Triforce of Wisdom and revive and fuse with Ganon for the Triforce of Power. But after all this, it turns out Yuga was using Hilda as _his_ pawn, planning to use the Hyrulian Triforce to remake the world in his image, Hyrule and Lorule be damned.
-   In _Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite_, Thanos is played like a fiddle by Jedah and Mistress Death, using his love for Death in order to kickstart the merging of the Capcom and Marvel Universes by Ultron and Sigma. The Stinger reveals that Thanos is not too happy with this level of betrayal and has obtained the Satsui no Hadou with the intention of _killing Death_.
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   Copy-X, and, to a lesser extent, Zero and his La Résistance allies in _Mega Man Zero 3_. Dr. Weil played them all for fools, orchestrating the new conflict between Neo Aradia and the La Résistance, which was just after an unofficial truce made by Zero and the Guardians. Zero goes off to fight Copy-X to stop the conflict, and when the latter tries to go One-Winged Angel, a booby-trap which Weil installed earlier on Copy-X, was activated, killing him. With Copy-X gone, Dr. Weil, the one next in power, is now the new dictator of Neo Arcadia. It was pointed out by Zero himself:
        
        _...It's all going according to his plans._
        
    -   Serpent in _Mega Man ZX_ was manipulated by Prometheus and Pandora under secret orders from Master Albert while serving as his Co-Dragons, intending for him to dig up and awaken Model W while stating that it will eventually devour his soul just like the helpless people he fed to it for the awakening. However, Serpent himself was seemingly aware of Albert's existence if nothing else, as he alludes to him in Aile's ending, though if he knew about said manipulations but disregarded them out of pride is up in the air.
    -   Prometheus and Pandora find themselves on the other end of this in _Mega Man ZX Advent_. At first, they backstabbed Albert and then fight Grey/Ashe. After they fight and break off the fight deciding it's just pointless, suddenly their anguish, hatred, and despair are absorbed by Model Ws in the background and then they collapse. The real Albert then appears, stating that the body that everyone thought was "Albert" is actually a decoy, and that those negative emotions are necessary to revive and activate the Model Ws.
        
        **Albert:** Just as I planned! Soon all of the Model Ws will begin to merge! I will become the ultimate Mega Man and the plan will be complete!
        
-   _Messiah_ has Bob guided by a mysterious voice to kill the dictator that rules Earth with an iron fist. Turns out, the voice is Satan, who was earlier captured by humans, and now with the dictator dead can take over the world.
-   A staple of the _Metal Gear_ series:
    -   Solid Snake is manipulated throughout the entire series. The most affecting part of the ending of _MGS4_ might be Big Boss promising Snake that there is no one left to manipulate him anymore.
    -   Arguably in the original _Metal Gear_, as Big Boss intentionally selected Snake as the agent to send false information back to NATO (and, by proxy, the Patriots), not counting on Snake's hereditary ability to kick ass and take names. If _Peace Walker_ is anything to go by (and possibly _MGS4_), Big Boss's misinformation doesn't even come close to the fact that the Patriots essentially manipulated Snake into trying to destroy Metal Gear and take Big Boss down as an insurance policy in case they failed to either bring him back into the fold or ruin/kill Big Boss the first time by one of their agents firing a nuke at the East Coast.
    -   _Metal Gear Solid_:
        -   Liquid's plan hinges on Snake discovering the card keys (really, three keys in one). To manipulate Snake into doing this, Liquid masqueraded as one of Snake's few friends (Snake's support staff apparently figured out the location of his radio calls, but not until the big reveal), locked Snake in a cell with a dead hostage whom a master of disguise had been pretending to be (Snake even recognized that the hostage should not have been as decayed as he was), and left the control room for the card keys virtually unguarded even when Liquid had earlier encountered Snake outside the room. Snake didn't realize he was being duped until after he activated Metal Gear. The sad thing is that, even if Liquid's plan didn't work or didn't even happen, Snake still would have been an unwitting pawn in either case. According to Liquid and his Pentagon spy, the real reason why Snake was sent over to Shadow Moses was to infect most of the people on the island, both the terrorists and most of the people involved in the REX project, so the Pentagon, and presumably the Patriots, would have recovered REX and the Genome Soldiers from the island without any risk of damage, even making absolute certain that FOXDIE was injected into Snake.
        -   Otacon designed Metal Gear REX under the assumption that it would be used as a mobile TMD to destroy incoming missiles — he had no idea that his employers would arm it with nukes instead.
    -   The ending to _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_ implies that Solid Snake and Otacon may have ended up being Unwitting Pawns of the Patriots all along.
    -   _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_ shows Naked Snake being used by the United States government into achieving their goal of gaining Russia's portion of the Philosophers' Legacy. _Portable Ops_ has Zero use Big Boss to defeat Gene and scare the Philosophers enough that Ocelot can gain control of their whereabouts and the American portion of the Philosophers' Legacy.
        -   _Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops_ also implies that the main villain, Volgin, was himself an Unwitting Pawn to a deviously cunning strategist.
    -   _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_ retcons many of the events previously established in the franchise. It is explained that the events of the first two _Metal Gear_ games involved Big Boss trying to create a place where individual liberty is guaranteed for everyone, instead of being a soldiers' haven. The Patriots have Solid Snake tear down both Outer Heaven and Zanzibar Land to destroy Big Boss' dream of freedom. The first two _Metal Gear Solid_ games are changed to have Solid Snake again being used by the Patriots and possibly Zero to defeat anyone who stood in their way. The Patriots by _MGS4_ (set in 2014) are now an AI system which was supposed to continue Zero's legacy by gaining control of all of mankind using the Sons of the Patriots (SOP) system. Snake is sent in to stop Revolver Ocelot from destroying the Patriots AI system. At the same time, Snake and his allies are used by Liquid Ocelot in his goal in destroying the Patriots AI systems, Liquid Ocelot pretending to plan to hijack the System using the AI named 'GW' and Snake and company countering it by using a virus to destroy the it, not knowing the virus as written by Naomi would destroy the remaining Patriot A.I.s as well; even if he didn't know about it or plan for it to happen, it certainly fit his goals. _Somewhat_ averted in that his own post-Patriot vision was averted by Sunny Gurlukovich, who wrote the virus to destroy the Patriot A.I.s but preserve key parts of modern civilization, and then, Drebin implies that Ocelot's vision of a war-torn world would still be an inevitable likely outcome despite this, that or the UN becoming a neo-Patriots/Philosophers III group.
    -   In _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_, other than the brief revelation that Coldman was the deviously cunning strategist who Gene alluded to in _Portable Ops_, it turns out that most of the game was manipulated by Paz Ortega Andrade, even the KGB agent Zadornov hiring Snake as a distraction to force Coldman to activate Peace Walker so that he could hijack it and frame America with an attack on Cuba, and she wasn't even the one who pulled all the strings: her employers, Cipher, had planned out the entire incident just to get Big Boss to rejoin the fold, and it is also heavily implied that they also ordered Paz to frame Big Boss and MSF with nuking the East Coast when Big Boss refused the offer. They also arranged for Kaz to briefly work with them, although it is also implied that they didn't tell him about the nuke plan.

-   _Monster Prom_: The REVENGE ending. Miranda will ask you to do a series of seemingly random tasks to help her out, with very flimsy reasons for it. It turns out that this is her plan to kill the water polo team for kicking her out by feeding them eggs from a sea monster and them telling said sea monster they ate her eggs, she reveals that this was her plan if invited to prom after the events are completed.
-   _Mortal Kombat_:
    -   Onaga's manipulation of Shujinko in _Mortal Kombat: Deception_ is actually the namer of the game.
    -   _He's_ got it bad? Poor Kitana has been a victim of this multiple times, throughout the whole franchise. The first time was by Shao Khan in _Mortal Kombat II_. Then it was by Onaga in _Deception_, and then by both Mileena and Jade in _Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks_. Even in the non-cannon _Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe_, she was an Unwitting Pawn of both Dark Khan and Quan Chi.
    -   In fact, this has happened to a _lot_ of characters in the franchise. It's hard to find one who _hasn't_ been tricked, brainwashed, and/or magically enslaved by one or more of the main villains at least once.
-   _Not for Broadcast_ has this pop up with one of the game's major political factions: Disrupt is secretly led by a group of corrupt oligarchs who are hoping to topple the Advance government and retake power in the country to set into motion plans of their own that makes Advance's policies look moderate in comparison. As for Alan James, the conspiracy theory-turned-terrorist leader: they consider him a useful puppet to dance and sing to their tune, unbeknownst to Alan himself, and once the oligarchs take control again, they have no compunctions with cutting Alan's strings.
-   Both the Judge and _the player him/herself_ in _OFF_ get played by the Batter. By the time they get to find out and correct their mistakes, it's far too late, as he already plunged almost the entire world into white void.
-   Edge in _Panzer Dragoon Saga_ spends the whole game being used by the Seekers, the Empire, and by Craymen, since he's the only dragon rider aside from Azel atop Atolm Dragon.
-   _Peret em Heru: For the Prisoners_:
    -   Professor Tsuchida offers a group of Japanese tourists the opportunity of a lifetime when he invites them to aid in his excavation of some underground ruins. In reality, however, he only invited them along as extra bodies: the place is full of Death Traps, and he sees all of the tourists as expendable. Even the nine-year-old girl.
    -   Come the climax, it's revealed that the professor also saw his assistant Dr. Kuroe this way. The only reason he employed him in the first place was in hopes of taking revenge for his failure to save his daughter Shizumi one year prior.
-   _Persona_:
    -   _All_ of _Persona 2_'s human antagonists are nothing more than pawns being manipulated by Nyarlathotep in its Cosmic Chess Game against Philemon.
    -   The main characters in _Persona 3_ spend a good portion of the game fighting a series of powerful bosses that appear once a month only to discover that Ikutsuki tricked them into doing so by doctoring video footage of Yukari's father so that he could summon Nyx. Ikutsuki's plan fails when he forgets about the dog. However, that mistake only serves to delay the inevitable, and the protagonist is ultimately forced to sacrifice himself/herself to prevent Nyx from bringing forth The Fall.
    -   _Persona 4_:
        -   If the player doesn't choose to immediately kill him (thus getting the Bad Ending), Taro Namatame is revealed to be a Tragic Hero with genuinely good intentions misguided by the true murderer, Tohru Adachi, who manipulated Namatame into throwing Adachi's intended victims into the TV World to try to save them from him, without telling him that throwing them into the TV World and leaving them at the mercy of the Shadows there was how Adachi killed people. When Namatame learns from the Investigation Team the truth about what happens to people thrown into the TV World, he has a My God, What Have I Done? moment. But then it turns out there's an even BIGGER Man Behind The Man who's been manipulating Namatame, Adachi, and _you_.
        -   The Investigation Team also end up pawns to Adachi. In rescuing the people Namatame kidnapped and threw into the TV World, they reinforced Namatame's delusions that the TV World was a safe place, which led to him kidnapping more people. Of course, their actions are still for the better, since the people Namatame "rescued" would have died had they not done so.
    -   _Persona 5_:
        -   The main characters' rise to fame was orchestrated by The Conspiracy, so that the good guys could eventually become The Scapegoat for all the crimes the villains committed using the Metaverse.
        -   Goro Akechi ends up being this to both the heroes _and_ The Conspiracy: The good guys _know_ he's working for the Conspiracy right from the start, and play him like a fiddle, while the bad guys plan on killing him the moment he outlives his usefulness.
        -   The heroes and The Conspiracy were both being manipulated by Yaldabaoth, the God of Order, who was manipulating both sides to eliminate any "chaotic elements" inside the Metaverse that would stop him from removing The Evils of Free Will from the rest of humanity.
-   _Pillars of Dust_:
    -   Carlton and Gregg are tricked by Almera and Elmer to venture into the Outer Plane, giving Almorigga a chance to kill them and return to full power.
    -   The Cult of Naev have no idea that their goddess is dead and that their high priestess is working for Almorigga.
-   Vhailor in _Planescape: Torment_ by the Practical Incarnation. And then, yourself fall for it, by the aptly-named Trias the Betrayer.
-   N of _Pokémon Black and White_. He was raised by Ghetsis to believe that all humans were bad, sheltered all his life around abused Pokémon. He genuinely had good intentions to free all Pokémon, but in the end of the game, we find out that he was just a pawn to advance Ghetsis's plan of dominating Unova. Poor guy doesn't take it lightly.
-   _\[PROTOTYPE\]_:
    -   Alex Mercer spends most of the game unknowingly aiding the plans of people who want him dead. First, he frees Elizabeth Greene, thinking she's just another victim. As it turns out, she's the Hive Queen behind the virus. Then he tries to help his ex-girlfriend, Karen Parker, by providing her with biological materials from the infected. As it turns out, Blackwatch has coerced her into working for them, and that genetic material Alex collected gets turned into a parasite which almost kills him. Then Blackwatch Captain Cross tricks him into going to a location where they hit him with both Bloodtox and D-Codes. Finally, the Supreme Hunter consumes Cross and uses that form to get Alex to kill off the Blackwatch leadership, and in an attempt to catch Alex off-guard so that the Hunter might eat him. Our Sociopathic Hero manages to overcome all this because he's a badass, but he does come across as a bit of a gullible idiot. Part of the reason is because the amnesiac Mercer, even though he's eating people left and right in order to understand what the hell is going on, is often in the dark about what the hell is going on. As the game progresses, he _knows_ he's probably being played, but due to a lack of options, he has to play along anyways if he's going to have a hope of accomplishing anything. He even says it outright to Cross.
        
        **Mercer:** Why do I get the feeling I'm getting the short end of this deal?
        
    -   Mercer and Koenig try to do this to James Heller in _\[PROTOTYPE 2\]_, but he cottons on pretty fast.
-   The hero from the _Quest for Glory_ series has a terrible habit of playing right into the game's villain's hands, even though he manages to fix things in the end. In _Quest for Glory 2_, he gets mind-controlled into releasing the evil djinn Iblis by the game's Big Bad, then is almost trapped forever in Iblis' chamber. In _Quest for Glory 3_, in an attempt to bring peace between two tribes, he brings their leaders together in front of a third-party king. Then one of the leaders becomes possessed and kills the other, and is promptly killed by another person in the room, almost guaranteeing the war he was trying to stop. In _Quest for Glory 4_, he falls for a trick by the Big Bad from the second game, back for revenge. As a result, he ends up having to go through the motions to release a monster on the world. However, Elsa Von Spielburg is the Unwitting Pawn in _Quest for Glory 5_.
-   _Radiata Stories_. Jack does Lucian's job for him. All he has to do is provide the tools and the directions.
-   _RealityMinds_: Ridgefern brought back Kvena as a ghost in order to observe whether or not she would misuse the power of the essences like he expected of people.
-   Excella Gionne from _Resident Evil 5_ thought that she was seducing Wesker and will arise as the queen of the new world Wesker creates. Wesker saw her as nothing other than an amusing pawn to further his Ouroboros research and disposed of.
-   Raguna is a massive one in the first _Rune Factory_ game. Going by hours spent playing the game, you will spend over 99% of the game actually supplying the enemy with energy for their final plan. Going by plot events, it depends on how large a percentage you want to give to the final boss fight end ending cutscene, because up until then you're playing into the Sech's hand.

-   Valdo, the protagonist of the PC game _Secrets of da Vinci: The Forbidden Manuscript_, falls squarely into this territory. He's on a mission at the behest of an unknown employer, unaware that doing what his boss wants will lead to either him either being killed or thrown in prison for treason (which would probably lead to his death anyway).
-   _Sanitarium_ has an interesting variation. There's two main antagonists the Morgan that exists within the protagonist's Dream Land, and the the one that exists in real world); both want the protagonist's death. The "unwitting" part comes from the fact that the first antagonist believes himself to be the second, and doesn't realize that killing the protagonist will cause him to die too; while the second doesn't even know that the first exists or that he's helping him by keeping the protagonist into a coma.
-   Mary in _Shikkoku no Sharnoth_ is obviously the pawn of multiple competing factions, but doesn't realize it fully until well into the story.
-   _Shin Megami Tensei_:
    -   Yuko Takao in _Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne_. In the middle of the bleak Death World that the Conception has made of Tokyo (and which she is semi-directly responsible for), she's contacted by a goddess capable of giving her the power to undo said horrors, with only the small caveat of adding her into the ruling pantheon when it's done. Said goddess isn't a goddess at all, and she never had the means to restore the world. The part about being in danger if she's not incorporated into the new reality is entirely correct, though.
    -   Zelenin from _Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey_. Manipulative Bastard Mastema and The Three Wise Men play her like a fiddle all the game, playing on her insecurities and fears like a cheap kazoo, which she always blissfully ignores, until either their plans come to fruition or she's been reduced to holy dust.
    -   The four Prentice Samurai, and indeed, _the entire Eastern Kingdom of Mikado_ are used as puppets by Gabby, who is the Archangel Gabriel in disguise to kill Kagome Tower's guardians and spring the captive Archangels.
    -   In _Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse_, Lucifer (and, to a much lesser extent, Merkabah) is revealed to be one to YHVH, being used by YHVH as a scapegoat to prolong the people's suffering and maintain his power. Also, earlier, every human is played like a fiddle by Shesha and Krishna after their supposed defeats in Ikebukuro and Tsukiji Konganji. Under the guise of Flynn, Shesha gets Nanashi to kill Merkabah and Lucifer so the Divine Powers can re-emerge at the last moment.
-   Harry spends most of _Silent Hill_ being Dahlia's Sucker, but his unwavering love for his daughter is also what causes him to be the Spanner in the Works. Depending on which of the Multiple Endings you get, you can argue the same for the protagonists of the other games: passively taking directions from everyone and their dog at every turn, but fully capable of killing the local Eldritch Abomination when push comes to shove.
-   In _Sonic Frontiers_, The one to fall into this trope is Sonic the Hedgehog himself. The mysterious voice that's guiding Sonic through the Starfall islands and instructing him to destroy the Titans is an Eldritch Abomination known as the End which wants to free itself from its imprisonment so it can destroy Sonic's world. Making matters worse is that the seeming antagonist, Sage, _knows what's going on,_ but withholds information from Sonic because she's an AI made by Eggman and thus automatically sees him as an enemy.
-   Patroklos Alexander from _Soulcalibur V_ is the son of legendary Holy Warrior Sophitia Alexandria and has pledged himself to hunting the 'malfested' who slew her and kidnapped his elder sister. So he winds up killing the human enemies of Graf Dumas, an alias of what amounts to the grand-daddy of all malfested... the Azure Nightmare himself.
-   There is sort of a subversion played on this in _Spartan: Total Warrior_ The game, like the movie _300_ which it shares many similarities to, consists of ridiculously epic One Against Billions battles and sweeping, one-button-per-5-victims decapitations like a living lawnmower, all while listening to the god of war Ares's evil laughter and bloodlusty encouragement ("Hahaha, kill and kill again!"). It appears blatantly obvious to anyone familiar with button-mashing spells and swordplay epics that he will turn out to be some sort of enemy in the future, and that his plan all along was to get you to kill every Roman and his mother, but it turns out that it's only half true; while Ares does indeed to turn out to be the Big Bad, your genocide on the Romans was merely a distraction so that your homeland of Sparta could be destroyed while you were away. We are treated to multiple more tropes during Ares's Hannibal Lecture, such as the fact that he is your father and Tiberias was merely a puppet. You technically did fulfill his plans for mass murder, but it was of both your enemies AND your friends.
-   _Spyro: Year of the Dragon_: Bianca helps the Sorceress abduct the dragon eggs thinking they'll be raised in the Forgotten Worlds, which will stop all magic disappearing from her home - the Sorceress really plans to kill the dragons and take their wings for a spell.
-   _StarCraft: Brood War_ was already a pretty confusing Gambit Pileup to begin with. Every character who isn't directly opposed to her ends up being one of Kerrigan's Unwitting Pawns as time goes on, with the exception of Samir Duran. He used her rise to power to speed up and hide his Protoss-Zerg Hybridization project. It can be said that the biggest pawn of all is Jim Raynor, who despite being one of the more heroic characters in the game, often ends up directly or indirectly helping villains, and in the grand scheme of things, is almost powerless. This tendency has unfortunately carried on into the next game. To his credit, he spends the _Wings of Liberty_ campaign openly bemoaning the fact that he's probably either being openly played with, or just being set up to be used later. He spends nearly as much time trying to figure out _how_ as he does trying not to have a bunch of Zerg chew his face off.
-   In _Star Wars: The Force Unleashed_, Starkiller/Galen Marek is shown to have been one when Vader reveals that everything up to that point had been planned by himself and Palpatine to have Starkiller assemble a proto-Rebellion. It didn't matter if his goal was to stay loyal to Vader and "distract" the Emperor, or if he thought he was fooling Vader and genuinely attempting to form a rebellion, his only purpose was to get them together in the same place at the same time. It only fails because Juno and PROXY are jointly the Spanner in the Works, one sacrificing himself to distract Vader as he's about to kill his apprentice and the other rescuing him after his fall. The ending also implies that Vader was also an Unwitting Pawn to Palpatine all along. He wanted to see if Starkiller had the potential to surpass Vader and become Palpatine's new apprentice.
-   In the old FPS/RPG _Strife_ you get hit with this in the bad ending, Blackbird, your Voice with an Internet Connection, is revealed to be the Entity and has been using you to free her.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   In _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_, once Mario collects every Crystal Star except the one the X-Nauts found before the game started, Grodus, leader of the X-Nauts, creates a plan to give the Crystal Star he has to Lord Crump, who he has lost all trust in, so Mario can take it from him and open the Thousand-Year Door for Grodus while disposing of Crump. Unfortunately for Grodus, upon achieving his goal of reviving the Shadow Queen, it's revealed that Beldam, leader of the Shadow Sirens that were working for him, had lied to Grodus about the Queen becoming his servant so he would try and use her to Take Over the World, thus making the entire X-Naut organization a pawn to Beldam.
    -   In _Super Paper Mario_, Dimentio spends much of the game manipulating Mario and co.
        
        _"Even if the count dies, the Chaos Heart won't disappear if I continue to control it! But I needed the power of the Pure Hearts to beat him. I couldn't do that on my own. So I had you do all the sweaty labor for me. And you even used your Pure Hearts to defeat Count Bleck! If they make greeting cards to thank people for helping with evil plans, I owe you one."_
        
    -   Antasma from _Mario & Luigi: Dream Team_. Although he's billed as the main antagonist, he forms an alliance with Bowser that backfires horribly for him, since Bowser turns out to have been taking advantage of him and screws Antasma over in the end.
-   In _System Shock 2_, this happens often enough through the game's plot that it's practically the player's full-time occupation. However, those who had played the first game, and knew who they were dealing with, walked into the Gambit with open arms.
-   In _Tales of Vesperia_, Harry Whitehorse unwittingly falls into Alexei and Yeager's plot to cause tension in the guilds by helping cause the death of Belius, and by extension, his grandfather, the Don. Belius gets better, the Don does not.
-   _The Tiamat Sacrament_:
    -   Gyle spends much of the game trying to force Xandra, the princess of Ildria, to surrender the throne to Ry'jin. Ry'jin never considers Xandra's endorsement a high priority, and only led Gyle to believe this endorsement is necessary so that he'll antagonize the party, thus increasing their motivation to unseal the dragons.
    -   Az'uar and Xandra are told by Faen to gather the Great Seven Dragons' Soul Gems to obtain the power to defeat Ry'jin. Faen actually is Ry'jin, who wants them to get the Soul Gems for his own use.
-   _The protagonist_ in almost every _Touhou Project_ installment. Blatantly obvious in the later installments, where Reimu is used by Yukari to counter Kanako's influence.
    -   _Silent Sinner in Blue_ manga: Remilia Scarlet realized she was a pawn of another character after a while, but decided to go along with it anyway. Partly to relieve some boredom and partly because, by then, she had actually started to care for the path she was being manipulated into following. Even worse, the ostensible "winners", the Watatsuki sisters, are completely fooled by both Yukari and Eirin's plans, tricked out of a rare bottle of wine by the first and getting extorted out of considerable favors by the latter.
    -   And in _Touhou Kishinjou ~ Double Dealing Character_, Shinmyoumaru Sukuna exemplified the "unwitting" part of this trope when she became Seija Kijin's pawn. Seija is an amanojaku, a youkai species notorious for being pathological liars and Manipulative Bastards, and Shinmyoumaru _was aware of this fact_ when she bought into Seija's lies. "Horrible Judge of Character" doesn't even _begin_ to describe it.
-   Non-FF Squaresoft example: Surlent from _Treasure of the Rudra_. Being fooled by a thief is one thing, being fooled about _once every thirty minutes_ by the very _forces of Creation_ is another. Although it quickly becomes clear that Surlent helping the game's Gambit Pileup along (and losing his body thrice in the process) is actually his destiny (by failing hard but consistently, he accidentally brings all of the MacGuffins to the right people at the right time), it still occasionally starts looking like a case of Just Eat Gilligan.
-   _Vagrant Story_: In a very unusual example, Ashley Riot was a Unwitting Pawn for an Anti-Villain, who manipulated him into _saving_ the world from the much more dangerous Knight Templar Guilderstern.
-   _The protagonist_ in _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines_. And with the Gambit Pileup that's going on, it's at time hard to tell exactly _whose_ plan.
    -   Possibly also anyone who tried to use the Ankharan Sarcophagus to gain power.
-   The _Warcraft_ franchise is full of these, really. Arthas thought he was fighting against the Scourge right up until they sucked out his soul and made him their champion. The entire Scarlet Crusade seems not to realize it's _actually run by demons_ (those Magnificent Nathrezim again.) And the quests player characters keep getting have led fans to lament "How many times do I have to help the Lich King before I learn better?"
    -   The game implies that Thrall doesn't really trust the Forsaken, apparently he flat out needs them because otherwise the Alliance is too much more powerful. (Without the Forsaken and the Blood Elves, the Horde would be entirely on Kalimdor \[and then Outland and more recently Northrend\] which is also home to two of the Alliance races _and_ a noticeable number of human outposts, including Jaina Proudmoore's city of Theramore Isle.) The other Horde leaders never even mention Varimathras when planning. It's very likely that nobody trusted him at all except Sylvanas. And Arthas was savvy enough to realize he was probably selling his soul and just didn't realize it was to his enemy. After all, it DID give him the power to almost destroy the Scourge. The Scarlets? Morons.
    -   Thrall is _not_ fooled though by Neeru Fireblade, who remains only at Thrall's pleasure because he doesn't have enough information to move against the Burning Blade cult, all the while convinced that _he_ has ''Thrall' outwitted.
    -   Sintharia, Deathwing's only surviving consort, despises him and plots to make a new Twilight Dragonflight to take over Azeroth. It is implied that she's been manipulated by him all along, as in Cataclysm, he has reanimated her and uses her eggs to create Twilight Dragons to assist him in his plans.
-   _Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War_ ends with Gabriel destroying Maledictum, which turns out to be the prison of Daemon of Khorne. Forces of Chaos used unknowing Gabriel as an Unwitting Pawn in their scheme to free the Daemon.
-   _The World Ends with You_
    -   Makoto wound up being one of these for Kitaniji, as the whole point of making the Red Skull Pins popular in the first week later comes back to haunt him in the last one when almost all of the Shibuya UG, citizens and Reapers included, gets brainwashed and homicidal toward Neku and Beat.
    -   The main characters themselves are pretty severe cases of this as well, especially Neku: Every single thing they did turned out to serve the sole purpose of helping Joshua fulfill his goal of erasing Shibuya. Although failing to defeat Kitaniji would result in Shibuya falling victim to an Assimilation Plot. This is one case in which the pawns don't have any choice but to go along with the scheme.
-   _World of Warcraft_:
    -   Horde-players visiting Dragonblight are offered a questline to help the Forsaken gather ingredients for a plague that will inevitably wipe out the scourge, which Puttress later uses to kill, not only scourge-soldiers, but also the combined army of humans and orcs battling them.
    -   Thrall and Sylvanas Windrunner are good examples. Thrall explicitly trusted Sylvanas, despite the fact that she was using the Horde for her own vengeance against the Lich King. In turn, she believed she had Varimathras firmly under her control, which is what he wanted her to think all along.
    -   It's implied that Thrall only let the Forsaken into the Horde because they need a presence in the Eastern Kingdoms, and because the Earthen Ring suggested that they could potentially cure undeath. The Forsaken are considered allied to the Horde rather than true members.
    -   There are multiple quest chains where you're suckered into doing a bad guy's bidding. Unfortunately for the bad guy, once they decide that you've outlived your usefulness, you show up with friends and proceed to beat the tar out of them and take their loot.
-   Fei Fong Wong of _Xenogears_. Not only was he a sucker for Solaris, the Wave Existence, his split personalities and his own prior incarnation, but even his close friend Citan manipulated him without reservations.

-   In the _Zero Escape_ trilogy, everyone who isn't Zero or willingly working for Zero is an unwitting pawn to some extent. Special mentions:
    -   Ace, aka Gentarou Hongou from _Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors_, ends up being used by Zero to mop up the other Corrupt Corporate Executives who ran the Nonary Game 9 years ago.
    -   Dio, a Free The Soul agent from _Virtue's Last Reward_, sent to sabotage the Nonary Game. What he didn't realize was that not only the organizers anticipate his infiltration of the game, it was actually necessary. If that's not enough, revelations in _Zero Time Dilemma_ show he was also Brother's unwitting pawn as well, sent in to deliberately fail without Dio's knowledge.

-   Vegeta ends up being this for Commander Daiko in _Dragon Ball Deliverance_, as he was being used by him to weaken the out of control Broly enough that the Legendary Super Saiyan could be retrieved and put under Daiko's control.
-   In the Strong Bad Email stupid stuff, Strong Bad makes a bet with Kevin Grumbles that he can make Homestar say something intelligent. In desperation, he tries saying something nonsensical (_"I say there, Homestar... butt's twelve by pies?"_); as it turns out, Homestar apparently made his _own_ bet with Kevin Grumbles that he could make Strong Bad say something stupid, and Strong Bad just won it for him. The real kicker is that Kevin actually wanted Strong Bad to make Homestar say something _stupid_, but Strong Bad thought that was too little of a challenge. Perhaps he should've asked an insultingly simple math question. He could have at least gotten Coulomb's law out of it. He also gets suckered in the game _Strong Badia the Free_. He spends the entire game trying to become the new king, only to find out that it was all a ploy by the King of Town to get Strong Bad stuck in the castle and the King in Strong Bad's position.
-   In _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_, the Emperor makes Magnus realize that both his supposed savior, Tzeentch, and his supposed Cool Big Bro Horus manipulated him so that he'd fall to Chaos and doom his people and Imperium. This plays crucial role in Magnus' Heel–Face Turn.
-   _RWBY_:
    -   In Volume 3, Yang's predictable fighting style becomes a useful tool for the villains to exploit during the Vytal Festival tournament. She is tricked into attacking Mercury unprovoked after defeating him in the finals. This results in a huge negative public backlash against Beacon which attracts vast hordes of Grimm that the military struggles to contain. This is the beginning of Cinder's plan to turn people against their governments, kingdoms against each other and start the process of destroying the Huntsmen Academies.
    -   Discussed. It is apparent to characters that General Ironwood's militancy, paranoia, and domineering, uncooperative and controlling nature are easily exploited by the villains. Tyrian comments that Salem's plans depend on Ironwood maintaining a mistrustful attitude, while Cinder observes that Ironwood's extremism makes him predictable. In Volume 7, the heroes repeatedly warn him that squeezing Mantle so hard to achieve his goals is playing into Salem's hands by turning Mantle against Atlas. After shooting Oscar for warning him that he's becoming as dangerous as Salem, Ironwood's descent into villainy climaxes when he holds Mantle hostage, threatening to bomb the city if the heroes don't surrender. Stating that he's doing Salem's job for her, Marrow abandons Ironwood, and Winter joins him. By the end of the volume, the kingdom is destroyed and the villains obtain two Relics.
    -   Discussed. Jacques's obsession with winning makes him a perfect dupe for Watts. When Watts offers to help rig the election so he can lay off his Mantle workers to cut costs, he happily agrees to give the doctor his log-in credentials to do so. Not only do the lay-offs and Jacques's victory increase tensions, draw more Grimm to the city, and gives Jacques the foothold to interfere with Ironwood, his upgraded access allows Watts to not only hack into more of Atlas' systems but also begin to lock the rest of the council out. Watts then uses this access to turn off the highly secure heating grid, causing riots and a full-on Grimm invasion.
    -   Councilman Sleet has legitimate reasons to denounce Ironwood for abusing his power and keeping secrets from the Council. However, being Locked Out of the Loop makes him vulnerable to exploitation, allowing Jacques to manipulate him into supporting an attempt to remove Ironwood from the council. Once he's brought into the loop about Salem's existence, and Jacques' deal with Watts is exposed, he becomes cooperative.
    -   In Volume 9, Neo's obsession with obtaining revenge against Ruby ends up accidentally furthering a different villain's plans by given them the perfect weapon to achieve their aim. The Curious Cat is Team RWBY's friend and guide through the Ever After, innocently asking all sorts of questions to satiate its curiosity that have the unfortunate effect of emphasising how dire Remnant's situation is, contributing to Ruby's slow mental breakdown. When Neo breaks down Ruby for her own revenge, the Cat intervenes and reveals that it wanted Ruby broken because it needs an despairing soul to possess in order to travel to Remnant to try and locate the Creators of the Ever After; it's been driven insane by the unsolvable question of why their Creators the brother gods abandoned the Ever After and will go to any lengths to find the answer. However, Neo's revenge robs them of Ruby, but leaves Neo an Empty Shell upon realising that Vengeance Feels Empty. The Cat is thrilled by this because it means it can possess the super-powerful Neo, who turns out to be a far more useful host for the Cat than Ruby.

    Web Comics 

-   _Bad Moon Rising_ recently showed that Terry was originally sent to Sokolov Academy to act as a spy for his mother, but was unaware of the real reason he was sent to the school at the time.
-   Sillice of _Drowtales_ when Kalki tells her that the Nidraa'chal she's just fighting are just a diversion for the enemies that are currently most probably killing the Val'Sharess. Sillice then barges into the ravaged tower, confronts one of her sisters (the only one NOT included in this plot) and then gets accused of having killed all the guards in an attempt to overthrow her mother, and has to run away to exile with their mortal enemies. No one suspects the ones that are truly pulling the strings: Snadhya'rune, Sarv'swati and Zala'ess, who get off scot free and take control of the clan while pretending their mother is still alive.
-   Fighter of _8-Bit Theater_ is an example of this. The other Light Warriors often get him to do things by convincing him it is for the greater good. There's also the fact that he still believes they're heroes after all the untold damage they've caused.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Tara is manipulated into attempting to kill Elliot by the Immortal named Voltaire who she believes is forbidden from lying like the Ancients of her world.
-   Nick in the "Surreptitious Machinations" arc of _General Protection Fault_. The entire plan hinges on him being isolated from his friends and building the "Project Velociraptor" to power Trudy's energy weapons, enabling her and C.R.U.D.E. to take over the world. He's also one of the only ones who still trusts Trudy, so the heroes have to try to convince him to see the truth.
-   Terezi of _Homestuck_ is usually Awesome by Analysis, but she's recently fallen into this at the hands of Gamzee, who she has no idea turned evil.
    -   Absolutely everyone to Doc Scratch. There's a _reason_ he calls people who aren't omniscient "suckers." Which is taken beyond the impossible in \[S\] Cascade, where its revealed that he manipulated the entire main cast into creating the Green Sun. Note that the main cast has been doing everything in their power to destroy the thing. Scratch's last word, said to Gamzee, is even "S u c k e r s", a succinct summary of just how much he played everyone.
-   _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!:_ In an uncharacteristically manipulative moment, in her second appearance, Voluptua lets Bob fly off on what he thinks is a very simple mission, while she suspects an alien supercriminal _just might_ be waiting for him.
-   _The Order of the Stick_
    -   Miko Miyazaki leads the villains to Azure City and allows them to discover the location of Soon's Gate. She kills Lord Shojo, leaving the city more vulnerable to attack. Then she _destroys Soon's gate_ when the villains are on the verge of losing, giving them a chance to escape certain death. And all the while, she believes that she's following the will of the (Lawful Good) gods. Although she was only being manipulated into the first one of these, the least important error really. The other two she she accomplished on her own.
    -   Vaarsuvius turned into one when they attacked Xykon with their newfound power, knocking him off his throne, exactly as the fiends who granted Vaarsuvius that power planned.
    -   As it turns out, _Xykon himself_ is an unwitting pawn to Redcloak, who's been playing humble servant all these years in order to get Xykon to aid in completing the Plan (which, it seems, doesn't aid Xykon's own goals _at all_). But he doesn't mind being a pawn, because he has better things to do with his time than deal with a backstabber who already has a self-destruct button tied to the back of their head: The Monster In The Darkness is brainwashed to kill Redcloak the moment he betrays Xykon openly.
-   Kat Vance from _Sequential Art_ finds herself in the Quinten Research Laboratory, where she learns the human staff has succumbed to deadly gas that permeated most of the facility. The A.I. Is a Crapshoot prototype computer OZ-BASIC explains that the fault that caused the tragedy exists in other Quinten facilities, and asks Kat's help in creating an uplink in panel #474, so that others can be forewarned in time. In reality, OZ-BASIC seeks to take control of the Pipingrad Death Ray satellite, with which to expunge all those that would oppose its Evil Overlord status.
-   Riff of _Sluggy Freelance_ was eventually revealed to be this, having worked for the Nebulous Evil Organisation Hereti-Corp producing inventions in return for funding, and not realizing the purposes they were being put to.
-   _Tower of God_: Rachel, Khun, and Bam all play into Yu Hansung's and Headon's hands in their plot against the ruling system.
-   _Trevor (2020)_: Downplayed. The new members of the medical team have no idea that they are part of a military-funded Super-Soldier project with Cold-Blooded Torture\-style experiments, but they are at least somewhat aware of how dark the work they've been doing is.
-   Played with in _We Are The Wyrecats_. K.A. certainly was this, but the rest of her team, as it turns out, is more than aware that the Big Bad is using them. They just aren't equipped with a lot of options on fighting back at the moment. By letting her remain unaware of this, K.A. effectively becomes her own team's Unwitting Pawn, and she does not take it well when she finds out.

-   _The Crew of the Copper-Colored Cupids_: In the short story "The Resurrection of the Wellsians", all of the schemes and counter-schemes of the characters turn out to have been furthering the aims of the Wellsians themselves.
-   Only just before the final battle of Web Game _Demon Thesis_ do the main characters realize that they've been pawns for the Manipulative Bastard Eldritch Abomination Mesmerus that they hate. After a strange stone totem was brought to the library of their university, the main characters suddenly found themselves gifted with Elemental Powers and other spells, and fighting off various monsters while Mesmerus encourages the violence. At the end they learn this is because them using his power to cast spells is necessary to weaken the barrier between dimensions and allow Mesmermus to cross over into our world. By the time they do learn this, it's too late to do anything, and Mesmerus appears.
-   In _The Normal Innocent Bystander's Survival Guide_, point 17 is:
    
    _"If the Evil Overlord offers you immortality, superpowers, or infinite wealth, and all you have to do is something that seems terribly trivial, don't. It's a trick. You will be used as a pawn in a larger game, and then crushed like a bug."_
    
-   In _The Ruins of an American Party System_, it's eventually revealed that Floyd Olson (otherwise presented as a President Mary Sue), has for most of his administration been manipulated by his Attorney General, Huey Long, who has been exploiting his influence over Olson to build his own political empire within the government, effectively turning Olson into his puppet. Once Olson realizes this, however, he spends the last months of his life before succumbing to cancer building up resources that his Vice-President and successor Fiorello LaGuardia is later able to use to dismantle most of Long's power base.
-   _Unwanted Houseguest_: So far there is no evidence that Doctor Litchfield is even aware of the Greater-Scope Villain who purposefully sent the Houseguest to him.

    Western Animation 

-   _Amphibia_: Marcy was lied to by King Andrias about his true intentions to use the Calamity Box to conquer the multiverse, instead playing on her desperation to stay with her friends by telling her that they would use the box to simply explore the multiverse with her friends forever.
-   In _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, Long Feng thought he was using Fire Nation Princess Azula to regain control of the Earth Kingdom capital, Ba Sing Se. In reality, she was using _him_ to take control of it for the Fire Nation. By the time he realized she was playing him, she had already turned his own men against him. When he admits defeat, obviously impressed at her, she rubs salt in the wound by indicating this was all he was to her.
-   In one episode of _Batman: The Animated Series_, a businessman builds a casino... themed after The Joker. Joker is understandably incensed, a breaks out of Arkham to punish this act of image-theft by blowing up the joint. As Batman discovers, the businessman had spent too much on his building, and gave it a Joker-theme so the Joker would do just that, and then cash in on the insurance. Joker gets more incensed when Batman reveals this to him.
-   _Big Hero 6: The Series_: In the Season 1 finale, Obake sends his minions after a case containing a failed prototype of an energy amplifier. It's actually worthless; the real reason is that he knew Hiro would become interested in making a real one, which he could then steal.
-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_: Numbah 1 (Nigel Uno) in _Operation: Z.E.R.O._. Father steals the "supposedly" inactive recommissioning module in an attempt to recommission Grandfather. All that was needed was a DNA sample from an active KND member, and knowing which KND operative would be so quick to come after him for the theft and to stop whatever plan that involves it, guess who suddenly became a key part of the plan?
-   Danny from _Danny Phantom_ becomes one of these almost every time he encounters Vlad Masters. Usually Vlad hints at what he's going to do right away, and Danny fails to understand and plays right into his hands anyway. Surprisingly, Valerie was an even _bigger_ sucker than Danny — her entire ghost hunting 'career' was started by Vlad as part of a gambit and just became the gift that kept on giving for him and all his plans. She was NOT happy when she found out the truth.
-   In Episode 7 of _The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants_, it's stated that Krupp and Melvin were using resident Misunderstood Loner with a Heart of Gold Bo as a scare tactic to keep the other students in line, which in turn makes everyone in school fear him. This later backfires after a comic book made by George and Harold completely flips the script and turns Bo from a threat to a hero.

    -   Timmy is an unwitting pawn sometimes, most noticeably in "School's Out! The Musical", where he, along with Flappy Bob, are pawns in the pixie's Gambit Roulette.
    -   Chester becomes this in "Fairy Idol" when Norm uses his friendship with Timmy to trick Cosmo and Wanda into quitting their jobs so he can steal their position and become _his_ fairy godparent in their place.
-   Where Sinedd from _Galactik Football_ goes, intergalactic conspiracy is sure to follow.
-   In _Gargoyles_, Xanatos was accustomed to using this trope: almost every major character was his pawn at one point or another. In one memorable episode, however, Xanatos is outsmarted and used as a pawn by one of his creations.
-   _Gravity Falls_ has almost every character that interacts with Big Bad Bill Cipher become this, furthering his plans for Weirdmageddon with every trick he pulls. This culminates with him possessing Blendin Blandin to trick Mabel into giving him the space-time rift that was the final key to his plan, causing the aforementioned event.
-   Kim Possible found herself in this position in _So The Drama_, when it was revealed that Erik was really a "synthodrone" working for Drakken. As Ron observed, "Drakken hasn't won, he played you." An even more direct case was in the episode "Hidden Talents", where Drakken created fake messages from Wade (as well as sending a virus to the real Wade) to get Kim to bring him one of Dementor's inventions. He also attempted to do it a second time after he forgot to tell Kim to get the adaptor plug, but the second time didn't work as well due to Wade debugging his computer.
-   In _Over the Garden Wall,_ the Woodsman is tricked by the Beast into maintaining the Beast's Soul Jar, which he believes contains his daughter's soul instead. He was also initially unaware that the eidelwood trees he was using used to be human children.

-   _Sofia the First_: Sofia is often this to Cedric in his attempts to take the Amulet of Avalor from her and use its power to take over Enchancia. Even her sister Amber is susceptible to this as shown in Season 1's "Princess Butterfly".
-   _South Park_:
    -   Both the Good and Evil characters in the Imaginationland trilogy, manipulated into war for a terrorist cell's plot to destroy collective imagination by getting both sides to kill each other, despite the narrative's full support for the Good characters starting in Part 2 as if the Evil characters were the Big Bads instead of the already-dead terrorists, when they weren't, despite what they literally are. However, the plot fails because the Good characters win the war and the Evil characters are imprisoned.
    -   Stan, Kyle, and Scott Tenorman in "Scott Tenorman Must Die". To a lesser extent, the rest of the town was this to Cartman in that episode. The only thing he hadn't planned on was Chef actually taking the Chili Contest seriously and submitting an entry, though this simply means Cartman has delicious chili to eat while he explains his master plan.
    -   This happens to Kyle again when Leslie tells him that Pc Principal killed Jimmy and that Randy is helping him to kill any objectors to his policies but in reality she'ss a ads who wants to get rid of Pc Principal so she can turn South Park against each so ads can take over the world.

As such, they sabotage Fives' attempt to reveal the truth and indirectly get him killed, and the Revenge of the Sith goes on without a hitch despite the best efforts of Master Shaak Ti.
-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_ has an interesting variation in that a villain is used as a pawn for another: that being Ludo being used as a tool and puppet by Toffee of Septarsis. Also later reveals that Toffee was being used as a tool and puppet by Glossaryck. Toffee was unaware that Glossaryck was using him and Glossaryck was also using Toffee's plans to release Ecplisa and made Toffee a sacrifice in order for Ecplisa to be released.
-   _Challenge Of the Superfriends_: In one of the more infamous plots from the series, the Legion of Doom collaborates with a group of Venusians to rework Earth's climate into something more tropical. To this end — in what may be _the_ single most contrived Gambit Roulette in history — they enact a series of disasters, and the Superfriends play right into their hands when their attempts to stop them result in _filling the atmosphere with steam, flooding the western hemisphere, and moving the Earth out of its orbit_.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_:
    -   In Season 4 of _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)_, both the turtles and the Well-Intentioned Extremist Agent Bishop are suckered _royally_ by the Foot Mystics/Shredder's Heralds, resulting in the _entire plot_ to Season 5.
    -   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)_: In early Season 5, Tiger Claw summons the demodragon Kavaxas to Earth in order to bring the Shredder, who was killed by Leo in the Season 4 finale, Back from the Dead, using a mystical talisman, the Seal of the Ancients, to keep him under control. By the fourth episode, "End Times," Kavaxas successfully resurrects Shredder... but Shredder is little more than a shambling corpse under Kavaxas' control, and destroys the Seal of the Ancients; as it turns out, Shredder's resurrection was one of three tasks Kavaxas needed to accomplish in order to bring about The End of the World as We Know It, and he was using Tiger Claw all along in order to accomplish those three tasks.
-   Harold in _Total Drama Action_, when choosing to listen to _Courtney and Duncan_ of all people, in order to vote off LeShawna, _his love interest_.
-   In the Season 3 finale and Season 4 premiere of _The Venture Bros._, Brock Samson is an unwitting pawn to Molotov, and Molotov herself is an unwitting pawn to Gathers. Molotov puts a hit out on Brock for three of the top OSI assassins and pins it on the OSI, getting him to kill them so that her own assassin organization, the Blackhearts, would have no competition. However, she doesn't realize that that's exactly what Gathers wants her to do, as it would later lure Brock right into a trap set by Gathers to coerce him into joining the reformed SPHINX.
-   In _Xiaolin Showdown_, Omi ends up playing right into Chase Young's hands in the second season, temporarily becoming his apprentice.
-   _Wakfu_: Qilby is very good at making Unwitting Pawns out of everyone.
    -   Anathar becomes one to Qilby. He's one of the Shushu and is only fighting on Qilby's side because of his alliance with Rushu, but Qilby baits Anathar into entering the fray so he isn't present for Qilby and Rushu betraying each-other, and therefore continues fighting for Qilby against Yugo and Phaeris long after Qilby's pact with the Shushus has expired.
    -   The Mechasms and their prince Orgonax in the Backstory are ultimately this. They went to war against the Eliatropes and forced the latter into a Homeworld Evacuation because Qilby ripped out Orgonax's heart — this was Qilby's plan all along, to manipulate his people into being _forced_ to become Space Nomads since Qilby wanted to traverse the stars.
