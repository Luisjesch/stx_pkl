In the United States, a sheriff is generally the chief law enforcement officer for a county or parish. It is usually an elected position, though in emergencies a sheriff may be appointed by county officials. Sheriffs and their agencies have the most influence in areas without a local police force, so expect to see them in rural areas or Small Towns.

In a Western, the Sheriff is generally the closest and main law enforcer. Their function in a story is very flexible, ranging from The Hero through Reasonable Authority Figure and Obstructive Bureaucrat to Small-Town Tyrant. It's a very lucrative and powerful (within the county) position, but also comes with great danger and responsibility.

In most works of fiction, the sheriff wears a distinct badge, usually star-shaped. And the sheriff usually is not the highest authority; he is actually appointed by and answers to an Ultimate Authority Mayor, who may occasionally be a Corrupt Politician. A corrupt sheriff, however, can have influence over a weak mayor. If the sheriff is ever disgraced or otherwise found to be morally unworthy of his title, the customary action is for The Hero to shoot a hole through this badge, symbolic of the title being stripped.

He's usually assisted by at least one Deputy Sheriff (often a Clueless Deputy), whom he appoints. Officers working for the sheriff's office are known as deputies, as they act as substitutes for the sheriff. Thus one of the stock tropes of the western is the county jail with its one cell, a desk for the sheriff and, across the room, a _smaller_ desk for his deputy.

In some Westerns, "Sheriff" is conflated with "Town Marshal" (not to be confused with the U.S. Marshal, like Marshal Dillon), a more localized version. If the plotline is about cleaning up one lawless town, with no reference to the rest of the county, you may be seeing this in action.

The Sheriff often handles minor offenses himself, locking up drunks and rowdies for the night. But serious crimes must be held over until the Circuit Judge arrives.

In westerns, this character often overlaps with The Gunslinger, though this is not always the case. A Real Life example of a non-gunfighter sheriff was Bat Masterson, who preferred the "big stick" approach.

As a stock plot, The Gunslinger (sometimes, the Young Gun, but if so he'll have his more experienced advisor with him) comes into town, and is immediately appointed The Sheriff by the townspeople. This invariably means there's a villain (an Outlaw or a old-west-style Corrupt Corporate Executive) in town who has run off or killed the old sheriff and is terrorizing the townspeople, stealing cattle, cheating at poker, and probably not paying his brothel bill. It's up to the new guy to avoid getting killed, beat the villain, then move on. Also see The Drifter for more detail on this.

The name is derived from the English "shire reeve", corrupted to "sheriff" over time. The position had similar duties and powers, but was appointed by the Crown. Perhaps the most famous Sheriff is the Sheriff of Nottingham. Outside of the US, a sheriff is normally a ceremonial post; in Scotland they are judges.

In the modern day, sheriffs tend to use their guns a lot less. In metropolitan counties, the sheriff's department generally runs the jail and does process serving, among other duties. As with everything else in America, this varies not only from state to state, but also from town to town. As with police chiefs, sheriffs are desk-bound managers in all but the smallest agencies. Regardless, as sheriffs are usually elected officials, they're usually politicians, with all the good and bad that entails.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Elmore Evans, the eponymous sheriff in _Lies of the Sheriff Evans: Dead or Love_. He's a great gunslinger, stoic, good looking, and all around excellent law enforcer... who became a great gunslinger and sheriff specifically to become popular with women. Despite everything, he's had _zero_ success, due to a mixture of "a lot of the women he's interested in turn out to be criminals" (he _does_ take his job seriously), "his attempts to seem cool based on his father's advice make them think he isn't interested", and "he and his rival are both interested in each other, but she's just as bad when it comes to romance as he is".
-   _Moriarty the Patriot_: With Billy the Kid as a character comes Pat Garrett, the Sheriff of Fort Sumner and Billy's childhood friend.
-   Kirito functioned as this in _Sword Art Online_. Unofficial, since SAO had no actual law enforcement, but when the player whose strength and skill is second only to the GM decides to take down bandits dead or alive, he's earned the right to be called sheriff.

    Comic Books 

-   Clara Bronson's job in _Copperhead_. Her deputy Boo served as the interim sheriff after the last one was killed in the line of duty.
-   Sheriff Diana Prince in the _Justice League of America_ Elseworld _Justice Riders_. The sheriff of the town of Paradise, she's the only survivor when it gets destroyed by Felix Faust in the pay of Robber Baron Maxwell Lord, and so assembles the Riders to avenge her town.
-   _Kid Colt (2009)_: Sheriff McGreeley is a Dirty Cop and Small-Town Tyrant who's determined to kill Kid Colt. That's partly because Colt killed his brother, but it's also clear that the family is crooked and Colt could derail their wider schemes. At one point McGreeley directly tells one of his lackeys that if Colt is captured, he'll never live to see trial.
-   A Stock Character in _Lucky Luke_, and a very diverse bunch, from the heroic to the corrupt (along with a few Real Life individuals such as the Earp brothers). Luke himself occasionally serves as sheriff, and in one story the town conspired to keep him busy with Fetch Quests so he'd have end up settling down and ensure no criminal would ever threaten them.
-   Pow-Wow Smith was a Golden Age DC Comics Native American sheriff in the New Old West (until the writers forgot, and put him in the regular Old West). The Wild West version of the character was later Retconned as being the present day's one Identical Grandfather.
-   Jesse Custer becomes Sheriff of Salvation in _Preacher_. When the Klan comes along to make trouble, he pisses out the burning cross they planted on his lawn, beats down the strongest mook they had, then dumps their leader (still in his robes) in the middle of the black part of town.
-   As _Sherwood, Texas_ is a Setting Update of the Robin Hood legend, one of the main bad guys is the Sheriff of Nottingham County: a Dirty Cop who is in league with the outlaw motorcycle gang the Nobles.
-   Basically a Stock Character in _Tex Willer_, with Tex and his pards often having to help honest ones (that sometimes are their friends and may have called for their help in the first place), if they don't need _their_ help themselves, and defeat (and sometimes kill) criminal ones.
    -   The unnamed sheriff of Gallup from the _Navajo Blood_ storyline deserves a special mention for the incredibly badass group he puts together at the end: Tex, Carson, Kit and Tiger Jack as his deputies and a Posse composed by _hundreds of pissed-off Navajos_. Justified by that storyline's main villains being two corrupt hicks who had shot four Navajo boys without provocation and had used their influence to escape the law, and now that Tex had finally succeeded in getting the authorities to move the Navajos wanted to make sure they wouldn't escape arrest and trial again.
-   Malcolm Reynolds, of all people in Boom! Studios _Firefly_ “New Sheriff in the ‘Verse” arc. He is appointed sheriff of a moon called, guess what, Deadwood, and ordered to arrest his mother, who’s been causing Blue Sun and the Alliance trouble. He avoids arresting her but Blue Sun is power hungry and Mal isn’t doing what they’d like, including siding with the little guys a lot and having issues stopping raids on their trucks. They give him a group of patrol bots based on his personality and face but without his sense of doing what’s right and they get so heavy handed that Mal and company raid the control building to destroy them all.

    Film — Live Action 

-   The 1947 John Wayne vehicle _Angel and the Badman_ has Marshal Wistful McClintock, a Friendly Enemy to Wayne's protagonist Quirt Evans, whom he regards as That One Case and says he'll use a new rope when he hangs him. He acts as something of a Greek Chorus, reacting with disbelief at how comfortable Quirt's becoming living with the Worths. He finally kills Evans' enemies Laredo Stevens and Hondo Jeffries when they draw on Quirt in a Showdown at High Noon at the end of the film, and is disappointed not to have caught Quirt red-handed. When Quirt announces to him that he's becoming a farmer and drops his gun in the dirt, McClintock says to his deputy he'll hang it in his office, with a new rope.

He visits Clay because he is visiting all the town marshals to warn them to be on the lookout for an outlaw who robbed the bank in the county seat. Maxton is also the one to arrest Clay when he is accused of murder.
-   Parodied by Sheriff Bart in _Blazing Saddles_. He was actually appointed by the state government, rather than elected by the town, mainly because the previous sheriff had been murdered and nobody in Rock Ridge wanted to be the replacement.

Unfortunately for him, Bart turns out to be pretty good at the job and wins everyone over.

-   In _Coroner Creek_, Sheriff O'Hea is an alcoholic who holds his job because his daughter Abbie is married to Younger Miles, the powerful man in the town.

-   The Sheriff in _Curse of the Undead_ is a Reasonable Authority Figure who remains adamant that he works for the county, and not any one person in it.

What he is not equipped to deal with, however, is a vampire.
-   Pete Anderson in _Day of the Wolves_. At least till he is ordered to Turn in Your Badge.

Brody has to investigate the shark attacks, tries to close off the beach to keep people safe, and eventually goes out to see with two other men to hunt and kill the shark, in order to end its threat.
-   In _Johnny Reno_, Sheriff Hodges is not a coward (despite what Mayor Yates thinks), but likes the quiet, easy life and generally goes along with whatever Yates want.

    -   Also on the show was Sheriff Little of Chickasaw County, a Scary Black Man version.
-   Sheriff Jack Carter of _Eureka_, though his job isn't so much to clean up the titular town, as to keep its Mad Scientist residents from turning it into a wasteland in the first place. This is a bit of Hollywood Law as Carter was appointed the Sheriff of Eureka by the federal government rather than elected by local residents, as is normal in the United States.
-   Paladin of _Have Gun – Will Travel_ often interacts with sheriffs in the course of his jobs. In one episode of the Radio Drama, Paladin helps out a "sheriff" (town marshal version) who's just returned from an Eastern education and is trying to enforce the Philadelphia city ordinances on a small cow town.

-   Amos Tupper was sheriff of Cabot Cove in _Murder, She Wrote_, later replaced by Mort Metzger.

-   As Neptune, California, in _Veronica Mars_ is an unincorporated town, there is a Sheriff's Department for the county, not a police force. Keith Mars is the ex-sheriff, ousted for political reasons. He was replaced by Sheriff Lamb, who was pretty much just short of being a full-on manifestation of Bad Cop/Incompetent Cop. He's never shown taking bribes, but when a high school student reports that she's been raped, he laughs her out of his office.
-   Sheriff Rick Grimes from _The Walking Dead_ and its TV adaptation. However, since society has pretty much collapsed by the start of both series, being a sheriff basically means Rick has a cool costume and a nice hat. On the other hand, before the end he was essentially an ordinary cop with a fancy title, whereas his lawbringing behavior post-outbreak is much more in keeping with the Western stereotype.

-   _Borderlands 2_ has The Sheriff of Lynchwood (Real name: Nisha), who isn't an actual law enforcement officer. She's simply Handsome Jack's girlfriend who was given control of the town as an anniversary gift and a villain with a taste for Western tropes and mass hangings.

-   _Mizzurna Falls_: Sheriff Morgan. He's described as having a severe personality, but has a strong sense of justice, and is someone you can rely on.
-   The _Reality-On-The-Norm_ series. The lawkeeper of Reality-on-the-Norm is a sheriff aptly named, well, The Sheriff. His clothes make him look like someone straight from the Wild West, even though it's not clear which country Reality-on-the-Norm actually lies in.

    Web Animation 

-   _Madness Combat_ has the eponymous Sheriff as the antagonist for it first arc (episodes 1-3). This particular Sheriff does not have any particularly notable qualities beyond his small Stetson hat and complete gutlessness. He is the only Non-Action Big Bad in the series, completely failing to lead his men or put up a fight against Hank. The reason why he's so useless is expanded upon in _MADNESS: Project Nexus 2_. To whit, he's not actually a law enforcement officer at all. He's just a grunt (and a mattress salesman at that!) who stole some police equipment when things went south and was later mistaken for an actual sheriff by other grunts. They treated him like an authority figure, so he acted like one despite having zero training or actual authority.

    Webcomics 

-   Arthur in the Western arc of _Arthur, King of Time and Space_. He has a lot of deputies, since he basically deputizes anyone who's a Knight of the Round Table in the baseline arc.

-   _Bravestarr_ was a Space Western sheriff.
-   The Sheriff from _The Deputy Dawg Show_ was frequently long-suffering over Deputy Dawg's ineptitude.
-   A Cowboy Episode of _The Flintstones_ had Fred end up as Sheriff with the bad guys about to ride into town.
-   _Hoot Kloot_, a cartoon series produced by De Patie Freleng Enterprises.
-   In the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ episode "Over A Barrel", there's Sheriff Silverstar of the frontier town of Appleloosa, who seems to be the only local authority figure. He even has a sheriff's star badge for a Cutie Mark.
-   _Quick Draw McGraw_ has been known to sometimes be a sheriff as well. Both were western set cartoons by _Hanna-Barbera_
-   _Ricochet Rabbit and Droop-a-Long Coyote_ had cartoons starring Sheriff (Ping! Ping! PING!) Ricochet Rabbit.
-   Sheriff Bronson Stone from _Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated_, like most of the rest of Crystal Cove, would love nothing more than to see Scooby and the gang run out of town on a rail. (There's much more than meets the eye.)
-   Sheriff Terribull from _Wild West COW Boys Of Moo Mesa_.

    Real Life 

-   Buford Pusser, as fictionalized in _Walking Tall (1973)_.
-   Bat Masterson
-   Wyatt Earp (Town Marshal variety, notable in the fact that his famous shoot out involved a conflict between the town marshals and the county sheriffs).
    -   Even more noteworthy in that the large majority of his career was spent arresting criminals, rather than killing them. In fact, if the stories are to be believed, until the series of events that eventually led to the showdown at the OK Corral, _Earp had never killed a criminal in his entire career._
        -   His preferred method of dealing with miscreants was pistol-whipping.
        -   Or pulling on their ear.
    -   Earp actually never rose above Deputy Marshal in any place he served as lawman. In Tombstone, he wasn't even on the town payroll at the time of the famous Gunfight. His brother, Virgil, was acting City Marshal and temporarily deputized Wyatt and Doc Holliday. Wyatt did server as Under Sheriff, but several political issues, including the county splitting in half, cost him that job.
-   Pat Garrett, the man who shot Billy The Kid (and wrote an awful book about it).
-   Bill Tilghman - the last of the old Western sheriffs. Rode with Masterson and Earp, killed in the line of duty at age 70.
-   David Reichert (currently US congressman from Washington State, Reichert is best known for his pursuit and capture of the Green River Killer, and is still known in his local area simply as "The Sheriff")
-   Johnny Behan, county sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona (including the town of Tombstone) during the Gunfight at the OK Corral. He was a character in the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Spectre of the Gun", which featured a recreation of the gunfight.
-   Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona. Makes his prisoners wear pink underwear, sleep in tents outdoors in the middle of summer (when temperatures routinely top 110F), and eat spoiled bologna sandwiches, among other things. Viewed as either a Cowboy Cop or a corrupt hick depending on how you feel about prisoner's rights.
    -   Lending further weight to the latter characterization, Arpaio also has a well-documented history of using his deputies to harass and intimidate his political opponents and media critics.
    -   His alleged mistreatment of racial minorities, particularly Latinos, has also been a subject of controversy. This has resulted in investigations by the federal government and has resulted in his office being forbidden to detain suspected illegal immigrants.
    -   His "birther" allegations towards President Barack Obama have been widely criticized.
-   Bob Vogel of Volusia County, Florida. _60 Minutes_ profiles Vogel's so-called "drug enforcement program" in which Vogel's men would stop suspicious travelers on I-95 and confiscate any large amounts of cash they might have on the basis of their being "suspected drug dealers" under authority of the state's RICO statutes. These "suspected drug dealers" included a 90+ year old great-grandmother who hadn't trusted banks since the Great Depression and thus kept her money on her at all times, a car dealer on his way to a "cash-only" auto auction, the recent winner of a game show who had taken his winnings in cash so he could show his family what "a hundred thousand dollars looked like", and a woman on her way to buy supplies after a hurricane.
-   Grady Judd of Polk County, Florida. When he found out that a man in Colorado was selling a book titled _The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure_, he had an undercover detective buy a copy, then sent two officers over 1,800 miles to arrest the author for distribution of obscenity. Once, when asked why his men shot 110 rounds at one suspect, hitting him 68 times, Judd replied, "Because that's all the bullets we had."
    -   The suspect in question was an armed cop killer who had shot a police officer six times, before shooting him twice in the back of the head killing the officer. And had just pointed the stolen officer's sidearm at the SWAT team.
