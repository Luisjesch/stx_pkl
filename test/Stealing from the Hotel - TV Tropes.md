"Sure you got enough complementary chocolates, Ross?"

_Everybody is corrupted by hotel rooms. You can't help it! It's the only place in the world where you walk in and the first thing you do is steal everything before you take your coat off._

A character steals items from their hotel room that are meant to be left behind for the next guest, such as towels, robes, ash trays and unused toiletries. This is usually played for comedy, showing that the character is petty, rude, cheap or without class. It often results when a character is staying at a much nicer room than they can usually afford.

This can be exaggerated by taking larger or more valuable items, such as the TV or furniture. In some cases, the character fills their suitcase with the hotel's items, leaving no room for the belongings they came with. If confronted, expect the character to justify the theft using some sort of Loophole Abuse— for example, stating that there's no signage prohibiting the removal of the items.

In Real Life, a lot of these items can't actually be "stolen" because they are _meant_ for the guest to take, like shampoo and bathroom soap. Many locales have laws that require the hotel to throw these out after every guest checks out, so if you don't take them they're just going to wind up in the trash. For the items that you're not _supposed_ to take, most hotels require a credit card be kept on file so the costs will simply be added to your bill after the hotel realizes they're missing. If the work recognizes that hotels now keep a credit card on file, expect part of the story to revolve around them trying to replace the stolen items with a cheap substitute so the hotel won't notice what happened.

This can a way to Poke the Poodle. Another form of petty theft is Stealing from the Till.

Both men have since become TV stars, Peter as a comic actor and Paddy as a dating show presenter.

    Literature

-   Dave Barry tells this story:
    
    _I was staying at a luxury Hyatt hotel. There was a little plastic sign in the bathroom that said: "Our towels are 100 percent cotton. Should you wish to purchase a set, they are available in the gift store. Should you prefer the set in your bathroom, a $75 charge will automatically be added to your bill." This was Hyatt's polite way of saying, "If you steal our towels, we'll charge you 75 bucks." So I stole the sign. Really. I kept it in my guest bathroom for a couple of years, to amuse guests._
    
-   Since Death in the _Discworld_ novels doesn't understand how human things work, the towels in his bathroom are thick, white, and completely solid.

Having stolen the towel in his room, Farnsworth left on a dark and stormy night never to be seen _alive_ again.

By the time they check out Ross' suitcase is so full of stolen items that it bursts open in the lobby.
        
        **Ross:** No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. _\[pause\]_ Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt... _\[he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand\]_ I wish I'd thought this through.  
        **Chandler:** I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs... _\[goes to take the bulb\]_...oh, you already got that.  
        **Ross:** Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.  
        **Chandler:** Ok, how about this? _\[picks up the remote control\]_
