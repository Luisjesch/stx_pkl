_"You are an honest and honorable man, Lord Eddard. Sometimes I forget that; I have met so few of them in my life. When I see what honor and honesty have won you, I understand why."_

After a little time spent thinking about it, it's not too surprising that heroes can often sympathize with certain villains. When you have heroes like the All-Loving Hero around, they're always looking to redeem and relate to anyone, and heroes that have a Dark and Troubled Past can surely understand how sometimes those experiences can put someone down a path to villainy.

What's more surprising is when villains, morally grey characters, or an ordinary Innocent Bystander who are not famous or admired look at the hero, and say "Man, it sucks to be him." Sometimes these people see how Being Good Sucks and No Good Deed Goes Unpunished, and it causes them to feel genuine sympathy and pity for what the hero goes through in being heroic. For the first two, it tends to serve as a Pet the Dog moment.

This can easily serve as a lead in to a villain making a "Not So Different" Remark, seeing the hero as a Worthy Opponent, offering to rule together, or, more darkly, trying to Break Them by Talking. It can even lead the villain to a Heel–Face Turn, if their sympathy for the hero overpowers their motivations for villainy.

Compare It Sucks to Be the Chosen One and Antagonist in Mourning. See Mirror Character for a frequent cause of this. When the villain sees the hero going through so much shit and cannot understand how they can still be heroic after that, it's often because Evil Cannot Comprehend Good. Compare _and_ contrast Baddie Flattery. Sympathy for the Devil is the inverse, when the heroes are sympathizing with the villain.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Attack on Titan_, Reiner Braun, despite what he says to his relatives, apologises directly for being responsible for what's happened to Eren Yeager and his friends and family. In the same scene, Eren shows some of the opposite of this trope, along with a "Not So Different" Remark. He still transforms into a Titan and kills Willy Tybur and a number of innocent bystanders, however.
-   In _Dragon Ball Z_, in spite of being enslaved by Babidi's magic, Yamu was genuinely repulsed by his partner Spopovich's Cold-Blooded Torture of Videl and even urged him to stop.
-   In _Naruto_, toward the end of Hinata's fight against Neji, Neji's teacher, Might Guy appears slightly sad when noting that Hinata is no longer able to fight against Neji and gives Neji a What the Hell, Hero? when he tries to kill her. Fridge Brilliance kicks in when you remember that he's also Lee's teacher, and he strongly identifies with those who are trying to take down a more talented opponent through hard work and determination.
-   A surprising number of villains feel bad for all the crap the Straw Hats go through in _One Piece_. It usually helps show the Morality Kitchen Sink going on all over the place. Most notably, Franky, leader of a vicious bounty hunter gang, breaks into tears when he hears how Usopp left the Straw Hats to keep the _Going Merry_. Keep in mind, he had savagely beaten up Usopp about a dozen chapters ago, and is now holding him prisoner. This eventually leads up to his Heel–Face Turn.
    -   Played for Laughs during the Thriller Bark Saga during Perona's fight with Usopp. He triumphantly shouts that her Emotion Bomb power has no effect on him because he naturally has "a negative personality". This _drives her to tears_ and prompts her and her mooks to start cheering for him to not give up, with him being frustrated by his opponent taking pity on him.
-   Since the Tag Battle Tournament at the end of the first season of _Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl_, Team Rocket grew a fondness for Ash's Chimchar due to his tragic backstory, even rooting for Ash every time it battled.
-   _Rebuild World_: Played with. A black ops operative, Erde, who Akira ends up fighting is a Noble Demon who out of a misunderstanding, pities Akira for being a Tyke Bomb. He isn’t one (it’s part of a Mistaken for Spies Running Gag), and Akira gives him Silent Treatment instead of correcting.
-   _Saki Achiga-hen_, Toki has a moment like this with Kuro, who is beginning to despair when facing the champion, Teru, and is not able to fight back effectively. Toki notes that Kuro, by attracting all the dora tiles, is hindering Teru's ability to make progressively larger hands, and is quite pleased with Kuro when she finally discards a dora tile, enabling her to win off Teru.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Captain Atom: Armageddon_, Captain Atom gets a lot of this, especially from Mr. Majestic and the Authority, who both recognize that Cap is a good man and a hero, and that it's not his fault that he's going to blow up and destroy the universe. They do their best to help him, and Angie Spica, the Engineer, a member of the Authority, even gets romantically involved with him. That doesn't stop her, and the rest of the Authority, from trying to kill him, in the mistaken belief that that will stop him from destroying the universe.
-   In _Knightfall_, Bane engineers a massive prison break at Arkham Asylum just when Batman is already sick and rough around the edges, knowing Batman's own worst instincts will compel him to bring them all in personally. Watching him afar, he concludes that if he _didn't_ want Batman's blood so badly, he'd pity him.
-   During the _Kindly Ones_ volume of _The Sandman (1989)_, Lucifer notes that while he once swore to destroy Dream (over a fairly trivial matter), he now feels almost sorry for him when he sees the mess that Dream has gotten into.
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   In one story, Spidey confronted by the Argentinian crimelord (and very powerful superhuman), the Black Tarantula, who seeks to kill the hero in order to seal a bargain with another crimelord. Black Tarantula proceeds to curb-stomp Spidey, wondering aloud why he refuses to quit when everyone is after his head. Then he finds out that the reason is that he's looking for the kidnapped Normie Osborn:
        
        **Black Tarantula:** I applaud your dedication, Spider-Man, as well as your sense of honor. Considering the current bounty on your head, only a man of exceptional virtue would risk himself to save the heir of an enemy!  
        _(short pause as he_ really _hits Spidey hard)_  
        **Black Tarantula:** ...which makes my own task all the more difficult. _(hits him again)_ While the local authorities may mistake you for a criminal, those who lurk in the shadows see your true heroism! _(stops fighting, as Spidey clearly can no longer fight back)_ Ironic, isn't it? Your enemies know you better than your allies. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
        
    -   In another story, Hammerhead hires the Hobgoblin to assassinate Joe Robertson; the villain has Joe cornered, and gives him a chance to beg, saying "I always love hearing a good grovel." Joe refuses, having learned a thing or two about pride in the previous story. The Hobgoblin grins a little and says, "I respect that, Robertson." _(Palms a grenade.)_ "Not that it's gonna save you. I just respect it." <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Fan Works 

-   _All For Luz_: Even someone with a black heart like All For One is compelled to make genuine effort comfort Luz after her horrible experience at the Battle of Gravesfield that leads her to break down into tears after its over, which is probably the first altruistic thing he's done in over a century.
    
    **All For One**: You’ve been through a lot. More than any child should have to go through.
    
-   Mixed with Condescending Compassion in _Dominoes_. As a empath, Shinichi is able to sense that most of those around him are well aware of how their actions are hurting him, and honestly feel bad about it... but not enough to stop. This, paired with the fact that his abusive father is so callous that he doesn't feel even the _slightest_ bit sorry for anything he's done, has left Shinichi deeply doubting his own worth.
-   _Foxfire_: The Kuchisake-Onna shows sympathy for Li's situation, touching his burn scar while noting that "You will never find peace so long as the person who did this lives."
-   _Gaz Dreams of Genie_: Despite being somewhat of a Jackass Genie, Azie still shows several moments of sympathy for Dib having to deal with having a sibling like Gaz and after switching lives with her, swears to be a better sister to him.
-   In _Introverted_, Naruto manages to barter with Kakuzu, offering him knowledge of the Rasengan. Afterwards, Kakuzu expresses his sympathy for just how screwed up Naruto's circumstances are, especially since he knows they're going to get significantly worse since he just betrayed Konoha. Despite this, however, Kakuzu also makes clear that he intends to collect Naruto for the Akatsuki... eventually.
-   Necessary to Win'': As an old friend of Hisa's, Yasuko has a lot of respect for her despite how circumstances have led to them attending different schools and pitted their respective tankery teams against each other. She also doesn't believe that Hisa's team has any chance of winning, but she sympathizes with her wanting to make the most of her singular shot at entering the high school tankery tournament.
-   In _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, during Ash's first encounter with Belladonna, she _instantly_ tries to comfort him upon realizing he knows what it feels to see a loved one being hurt. The fact that she discovered they might be half-siblings is also a major factor in this.
-   In the fifth chapter of _The Story of Apollo, Daphne and Luca: An Italian Tragedy_, Vincenzo in spite of being a haughty jerk and a petty bully, feels genuinely concerned about Luca's emotional state after his fight with Giulia.
-   _Tidal waves_: In one chapter, Hawkmoth watches Nadja's live interview with Ladybug and Chat Noir, only to find himself wincing sympathetically when Nadja badgers the superheroine to "confirm" her nonexistent romantic relationship with her crimefighting partner, presenting "evidence" of their supposed relationship out of context, talking over her, and ultimately driving Ladybug to tears. (This also gets _Chat Noir_ to apologize for joining in on the badgering, albeit with a "Just Joking" Justification.)

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The Joker often tries to relate to Batman throughout the course of _The Dark Knight_, especially in expressing how they're both freaks on the margin of society. At the very end he even grudgingly praises the fact that Batman is incorruptible, and cannot be made to break his moral laws. Unfortunately he had a backup plan, and succeeded in breaking Harvey Dent.
-   At the very end of _The German_, The German silently offers a cigarette to Red Leader, after both pilots have been interned by the neutral Irish.
-   Parodied in _Hot Shots! Part Deux_ when a victim of torture refuses to crack, leaving his captors genuinely impressed—"I see you're no stranger to pain". The guy informs him "I've been married". His captors nod in sincere sympathy and agreement, then wince in horror when he says "_Twice_".
-   Villain Protagonist Yuri Orlov shows a grudging respect and admiration for Hero Antagonist Agent Valentine several times in _Lord of War_. Specifically, Yuri goes out of his way to point out Valentine's honesty and integrity, and Yuri seems to be showing some sympathy when Valentine is about to be betrayed by the system he has risked his life defending.
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_:
    -   _Thor: Ragnarok_: Loki expresses his sympathy to Thor, when he visits him in the dungeons on Sakaar, about Thor discovering that their father Odin lied to him about being his firstborn. Loki, who discovered in _Thor_ that he is actually adopted, knows very well what it feels like being lied to for your entire life.
        
        **Loki:** Hurts, doesn't it? Being lied to. Being told you're one thing... and then learning it's all a fiction.
        
    -   _Avengers: Infinity War_: Thanos, of all people, does this multiple times throughout the film. He holds no malice to the heroes for opposing him; he understands why they don't want him to kill half the universe.
        -   He gives this lecture to Thor and Loki after decimating the Asgardian escape ship.
            
            **Thanos:** I know what it's like to lose. To _feel_ so desperately that you're right, yet to fail nonetheless. Dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives.
            
        -   He voices his respect for Tony Stark, just as Thanos is about to kill him.
            
            **Thanos:** I hope they remember you.
            
        -   He _comforts_ Wanda after she is forced to kill Vision to prevent Thanos from getting the Mind Stone, softly telling her that he understands exactly how she feels (because he has just sacrificed Gamora, his adoptive daughter and the one person he truly loved, earlier)... before using the Time Stone to reverse Vision's Heroic Suicide and taking the Mind Stone from him _anyway_.
            
            **Thanos:** I understand, my child. Better than anyone.  
            **Wanda:** You could never.  
            **Thanos:** Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now is no time at all.
            
    -   _Avengers: Endgame_ reveals that Thanos has always felt this way about all the creatures he's killed and the planets he's destroyed, remarking that it's never been personal and that he considers it Necessarily Evil and For the Greater Good. However, with all the trouble Earth has been giving him, knowing they were well on their way to undoing his victory, and that they even managed to _kill_ his future self, he admits he's going to sincerely enjoy obliterating the Earth:
        
        **Thanos:** In all my years of conquest... violence... slaughter... It was never personal. But I'll tell you now... what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet... I'm gonna enjoy it. Very, very much.
        
-   In the 2003 film version of _Peter Pan_, Hook uses a Breaking Lecture on Peter to take away his flight and distract him. Throughout it, Hook talks about how Wendy will eventually grow up and move on, leaving Peter to die alone, forgotten, and unloved. At the end he suddenly looks tremendously sad and adds "Just like me."
-   This is the source of Riddick's redemption in _Pitch Black_. He's a borderline sociopathic murderer who has been killing people all his life to escape his past and will sacrifice anyone to save himself. Carolyn Fry starts out much the same way; while not being a criminal she's willing to jettison all the passengers in the opening and tries to cope with the guilt for the rest of the movie. Riddick initially admires Fry for her "strong survival instinct" and offers her at the end to leave the planet together by threatening to leave her behind to die if she doesn't. She eventually refuses and professes her willingness to die for the others. This declared intent of self-sacrifice intrigues Riddick enough to go back with her. He is eventually distraught when she sacrifices herself to save him and he angrily yells that she said she would die to save the passengers, but "not for me!"
-   There's a scene in _The Prophecy_ where Satan briefly commiserates and shows sympathy to Detective Daggett (a cop who years earlier lost his faith just before he was set to become a Catholic priest) about how hard it is to believe and keep faith.
-   _Spider-Man Trilogy_:
    -   After Spider-Man saves the train from falling off the tracks in _Spider-Man 2_, he's exhausted and almost falls off the train. The people in the train pull him back in and lay him on the floor. Peter's lost his mask in the fight, so everyone in the train can see how young he is. One man notes with sympathy, "He's... just a kid. No older than my son." One young bystander gives Peter back his mask, and they promise to keep his secret. Then when Doctor Octopus returns, they all vow to protect him. Unfortunately, Doc Ock doesn't have a problem with that.
    -   The first movie also has Innocent Bystanders coming to Spidey's aid when he chooses to save both MJ and the children, enabling him to succeed and disproving, at least for the moment, the Green Goblin's claim that eventually the people will come to hate him.

    Literature

    -   The Spymaster Varys berates Mr. Honor Before Reason himself, Ned Stark, for the various huge political mistakes that Ned made in attempting to be The Good Chancellor until Ned says that it was all in attempt to be merciful to innocent children. At that point Varys makes a statement that both admires Ned's integrity and weighs the cost of those mistakes, (Ned is injured and feverish while Locked in the Dungeon, his best friend was murdered, one of his daughters taken captive by his enemies, all of his men killed, etc.) where he basically concludes that no wonder other people don't try to be a hero like Ned.
    -   Jaime Lannister expresses sympathy for how Ned's older brother and father were executed, believing it heinous. He muses over the fact it was the Starks' cruel treatment at the Mad King's hand that was one of the reasons why he killed Aerys and yet such an act brought him the contempt of Ned Stark.
-   Near the end of the Harry Turtledove series _World War_, Nazi commando Otto Skorzeny has a moment where he admires the bravery and skills of a couple of Polish sharpshooters sent after him.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _24_: Corrupt Corporate Executive Jonas Hodges expresses sympathy for Jack Bauer.

    -   Jaime Lannister expresses a degree of sympathy and respect for Ned Stark (despite there being _absolutely_ no love lost between them) when he sees Ned setting himself up for a fall. He also shows similar sympathy for Ned's father and brother when he speaks of how they were horrifically executed by The Mad King.
        
        **Jaime:** Poor Ned Stark. Brave man, terrible judgement.

    -   Varys is supportive of Tyrion in the gloomy aftermath of "Blackwater" and informs him about the attempt on his life and of his demotion.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   During James Storm and Eric Young's match during the 2007 TNA "Fight For The Right" tournament, Storm accidentally hit his manager, Jacqueline, while she was trying to interfere on his behalf. It still ended up working out though, because Eric Young decided to make sure she was alright, creating enough of a distraction to give Storm the advantage. To Storm's protests however, Jacqueline gave Young a beer in appreciation afterwards.
-   La Parka Jr. and Cibernético both wanted to take down La Sociedad in AAA but Cibernético and Los Bizarros, the tweeners in the angle, only slightly prioritized attacking La Sociedad over attacking Jr, to the point Jr formed his own group, El Inframundo, to defend himself from Los Bizarros. When that proved insufficient, La Parka Jr ended up joining La Sociedad itself. When Los Bizarros continued to defeat them though, La Sociedad turned on La Parka Jr as a scapegoat for their failure, causing Cibernético to finally work with him against their common enemy.
-   In spite of everything Juliette The Huntress had done to Black Rose, La Rosa Negra simply regarded her as a kid who had fallen in with a bad crowd and was friendly to Ivelisse Vélez when they reunited in the fifty states. Velez remained unfriendly until Negra was among the wrestlers trying to save her from vengeful Power Stable Valkyrie(and failed horribly). The first wrestler to successfully defend Velez from Valkyrie was Mercedes Martinez, who just before had derided Velez for joining in the first place. Velez went on to form a Power Trio with Amanda Rodriguez, a rookie who had been abandoned by all her associates in pro wrestling, _and_ La Rosa Negra after witnessing former stablemate Taylor Made beat Rosa senseless with a pair of brass knuckles while former manager April Hunter tried to keep anyone from stopping her. Martinez criticized Velez for forming another group and shooed Velez out of the arena while she was watching Negra and Rodriguez wrestle a Tag Team match ringside. But after VALkyrie's team Better Than You cheated to win and then beat down of Negra and Rodriguez with the group's muscle, Martinez not only became protective of them herself but officially joined Velez's Sicarias, turning it into a stable in it's own right.

    Theatre 

-   In _Antony and Cleopatra_, Octavius Caesar spends most of the play bringing Antony down, but still seems to feel sorry for him; though the "Poor Antony" line can come across as either sincere or mocking depending on the direction, his open and indisputable grief when he hears of Antony's death suggests he was sincere.
-   In _Cyrano de Bergerac_, De Guiche, initially a villainous character, comes to feel great respect for Cyrano. He recognizes that Cyrano doesn't prosper because he never sacrifices his principles, and he (De Guiche) lives a life of prosperity because he does, and part of him wishes he had Cyrano's moral courage.

    Webcomics 

-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_:
    -   Mottom is able to muster a surprising amount of kinship with Allison in _Wielder of Names_, pointing out that Allison reminds Mottom of herself, several thousand years ago. Both started out as innocent young girls granted power and responsibilities they never asked for and never wanted, and now have little choice but to play their roles. Allison ends up throwing Mottom's sympathies in her face, by pointing out that despite the horrors that was done to her Mottom has never bothered trying to use that power to improve herself and just makes life worse for everyone else. Mottom even tries to give her own responsibilities to Allison.
    -   In _Breaker of Infinities_, Jadis, who knows Allison's future and knows the future cannot be changed, still tries to 'save' her from it by giving her a "Leave Your Quest" Test.

    **Yamcha:** Huh. Thanks, man.  
    **Cell:** Yamcha for the love of _God_, don't _thank_ him!
    

    Western Animation 

-   _Batman: The Animated Series_: The episode "Harley's Holiday" has Harley Quinn released from Arkham after being judged sane and redeemed. Although she genuinely is, at the start, a misunderstanding whilst buying a new dress<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  leads to a case of Disaster Dominoes that sees Harley being chased by the cops, the mob, and a mad general driving a tank through town. All the while, Batman keeps trying to talk Harley into surrendering so they can sort things out. This leads to this exchange at the end, after Batman finally takes her back to Arkham:

She promptly gives him a chaste peck on the cheek as thanks... then stops, thinks about it, and gives him The Big Damn Kiss that has Robin and Poison Ivy looking on stunned, before suggesting that Batman call her later, which makes him gently chide her not to push her luck.

-   _Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker_: Set up and then defied for the sake of Kick the Dog when the Joker finally finds out Batman's secret identity and the reason he became such:
    
    **The Joker:** It's true, Batsy. I know everything. And, kind of like the kid who peeks at his Christmas presents, I must admit, it's sadly anti-climactic. Behind all the "sturm und batarangs", you're just a little boy in a playsuit, crying for mommy and daddy. It'd be funny if it weren't so pathetic... Oh, what the heck, I'll laugh anyway! _(maniacal, mocking laughter)_
    
-   Sir George in _Ben 10: Ultimate Alien_, the founder of the persistent enemy faction the Forever Knights is sympathetic to the pressures that Ben has to deal with from everyone around him, as he has dealt with the same (even from the same person in Azmuth). As George is more of an anti villain than a full on antagonist and both are aiming to stop the same enemy (Dagon), this leads to the two being able to understand each other and strike up something approaching an arrangement to deal with said mutual problem even as they disagree on methods.
-   Discord toys with this in _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   In "The Return of Harmony — Part Two", Twilight Sparkle is thoroughly broken, alone, and defeated, and Discord appears to gloat.

    -   When Discord once again causes trouble in "Keep Calm and Flutter On", he asks the duped Fluttershy to come join him in his chaos like he had with Twilight above. When she angrily refuses his friendship, he scoffs at the idea he should feel bad just because she's the one friend he ever had.... His Heel–Face Turn is cemented when realising he actually feels bad for how his plan affected Fluttershy.
-   In _The Venture Brothers_, The Monarch tries to break Dr. Venture with a device designed to generate mental trauma, but finds that he's already so broken that it doesn't have any effect. Another time, he and Dr. Girlfriend manage to break into Dr. Venture's lab, but quickly lose the will to do anything once there after seeing an entire history of Dr. Venture's failures there.
    
    **The Monarch:** What can I do to this guy that life hasn't already? I almost feel sorry for him.
