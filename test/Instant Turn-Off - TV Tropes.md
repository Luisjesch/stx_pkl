_"So you know, if you ever use the phrase 'get with child' while we're trying to get busy, you're going to find yourself with negative access to my reproductive organs."_

— **Verity Price**, _InCryptid_, "Waking Up in Vegas"

A character that Really Gets Around wants to get aroused with some content the person likes, so makes a search and gets a material to get aroused. _Then_ suddenly this character discovers the content is Squick, has Jump Scare or is The Reveal that could be is that it was their parent/sibling/close friend/a robot and if it was someone of the opposite gender to what they thought it was, then it most likely crossovers with Unsettling Gender-Reveal. Or even it's something the character dislikes or hates. The case is the content becomes more than just a Fetish Retardant, the character becomes so horrified with the content that stops with their actions, and in many cases, it has to go to therapy. In other cases, the character only turns off and get away from the situation or the scene they were involved with.

Sub-Trope of Moment Killer. Compare Too Much Information and Squick. Contrast Fetish, where a character intentionally looks for something unusual for arousal. Also contrast in the case the character got aroused with the content, anyway. See also Think Unsexy Thoughts. Related to Fan Disservice.

See also Wasted Beauty, for a good-looking _person_ who might draw attraction/arousal from others, if not for some serious personality flaw or quirk that drives suitors away.
