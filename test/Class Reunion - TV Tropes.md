**Sharon**: I've never been to a school reunion.

**Tracey**: Well, that's fair enough. You never really went to _school_.

A common trope used to give a character or characters a chance to interact with old classmates and/or as a flash-back to the days when they were in school. Sometimes used to portray how much a character has changed, grown-up, or become "cool" (or alternatively, how the character hasn't changed a bit), or just as an excuse to put the character in a funny looking wig, glasses or braces.

Often, the roles the characters held when they were at school have been completely reversed to ironic effect; the Alpha Bitch and her Girl Posse who once ruled the school with velvet fists are now frumpy, frustrated housewives, the Jerk Jock who was king of the sports team is now an overweight loser (usually _married_ to the ex-Alpha Bitch, much to their mutual regret), the mousey shy girl in glasses who was picked on mercilessly by the Alpha Bitch now possesses the looks of a gorgeous supermodel and the nerds and Geeks tormented by the Jerk Jock are now handsome super-successful Dot-Com millionaires.

Sometimes, shows with ensemble casts will reveal that Everyone Went to School Together, in which case an alternative to the above is that they're all in exactly the _same_ roles.

Subtropes include Reunion Revenge; Old Friend, New Gender may also occur, but is not an actual Sub-Trope.

-   The point of the _American Reunion_.
-   In _An Autumn Afternoon_, Shuhei, Kawai, Horie, and a few of their friends from school meet up along with one of their old teachers.
-   _Compagni di Scuola_ is all about the reunion of former high school schoolmates, fifteen years after the graduation.
-   _Grosse Pointe Blank_ has this initiate the plot. The twist is that the main character ended up becoming an assassin.
-   Played for laughs in _National Lampoon's Class Reunion_.
-   One of the central plot points of _Off the Black_ involves Ray roping David into posing as his son for his 40th high school reunion. In a twist on the usual plotline of the attendee being a loser, Ray was actually well-liked, and renowned for his popularity in high school. Which, of course, only makes it more painful that he's accomplished so little in those 40 years.
-   _Peggy Sue Got Married_ opens with the title character and her husband attending their 25-year high school reunion.
-   The whole point of _Romy and Michele's High School Reunion_. The two outsider/slacker heroines themselves, Romy and Michele, were constantly bullied in high school. While they have not actually become outstanding successes, with Romy working as a cashier and Michele currently being unemployed, they are clearly happier than the former Alpha Bitch and Jerk Jock, and it also uses a common trope in the genre when it turns out that a Goth who had no friends in school has become a businesswoman, and the geek who had a crush on Michele in school has become wealthy and attractive, and even gets his chance to begin dating her. Michele and Romy are eventually inspired by the reformed Beta Bitch, a successful fashion editor, to become professional fashion designers.
-   _Zack and Miri Make a Porno_ begins with the two impoverished-slacker main characters reluctantly attending their high school reunion, with Miri in it to seduce the Jerk Jock who bullied her but who she always had a secret crush on; it turns out that with age and maturity, he's still a handsome and debonair man, but is also a lot nicer and friendlier to Miri. He's also gay. Miri is happy about the first two, not so much about the third. The whole 'everyone's changed and the losers are now winners' thing is also spoofed slightly, in that Zack and Miri haven't changed that much since high school:
    
    **Miri**: Look, even though we're broke and we never amounted to anything, we're still better than these people, right?
    
    **Zack**: No. Not at all. We're probably not even as _good_ as most of them, unless one of them's a crackhead or something.
    

    Literature 

-   Isaac Asimov's "Flies": John Polen, Kendell Casey, and Winthrop are meeting together for their twenty-year college reunion, trying to fit together the way they used to, despite all three of them having become more cynical and jaded than they used to be. We get Flashbacks to events taking place ~twenty years ago, as the characters reminisce about their past.

    Damn, thought Polen fretfully, why do people attend college reunions?

Krystal than asks him out on a date, and they become an item, even though Fred laments his lost quiet life many times, as Krystal is a very adventurous girl.

To boost his confidence his father tells him a white lie regarding a new job at another radio station, unaware that one of Frasier's classmates owns the station. Hilarity ensues.
-   Surprising considering its genre, but _Stargate SG-1_ had this moment when Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell showed up to his class reunion with Vala Mal Doran, a human who is technically an alien. The whole town ends up thinking they're sleeping together, particularly since alien Vala misunderstands appropriate human behavior and invents vast sexcapades for the two of them.

When Peg tries to campaign for votes, everyone gives her the cold shoulder because of her Alpha Bitch status in high school, while Al is called a coward for not taking up his rival's challenge to renew their fight.

(And yes, the reunion became the backbone of the mystery.)
-   _The Mentalist_ episode "Rose-Colored Glasses" leads the team to a high-school reunion. A very funny scene has Agent Rigsby, after Jane coaches him to use his memory tricks, show up at the reunion posing as a former student. This ruse flushes out the killer.

In the end, while slow dancing with her Love Interest, she calls it "The prom I never got to go to."

To get his computer passwords, the Leverage team set up a Class Reunion with Nate taking on the role of a Jerk Jock who had degenerated into a drunken slob.
-   The premise of TV Land's reality show "High School Reunion". It was sort of depressing watching a bunch of middle-aged people try to rekindle old high school flames, dig up long forgotten grudges, and exploit the one transgender person for all of their commercials. No wonder the only positive reviews they used for their ads were anonymous Facebook updates about the show.
-   The _Smallville_ episode "Homecoming" Clark and Lois attend their high school reunion. Since Lois only attended Smallville High for a few days, nobody remembered her, much to her dismay, and everyone just assumed she was there just because Clark brought her.

-   _Degrassi: The Next Generation_ (as it was then) used the 10-year reunion of the class of '91 as the Pilot's B-plot.
-   The _Dexter_ episode, "Those Kinds of Things", Dexter goes to his 20-year high school reunion with the primary goal of determining whether his high school crush was murdered by her husband (and if so, to kill him). He also learns that he was a lot more popular and likeable that he had imagined and many of his classmates are very happy to see him.

-   _Dinosaurs_ had one episode where Ethyl, with help from Earl, attended one of those. Much to her disappointment, she was the only one attending because she was the only one of her class who was still alive. She ends up winning every award of the night, including least AND most distance traveled to attend. Given how often the Rule of Cool was invoked in the series, it's no wonder they bothered to organize a reunion for only one person, but Fridge Logic says there shouldn't have even been that; since the episode in which she's introduced involves ritual death at a specific age, which she is past and was the 1st person to refuse the ritual. If she was past that age all her classmates would have been as well (hence they're all dead already and she shouldn't have been surprised).

Spence ends up picking up a lesbian and Danny picks up the former star quarterback, who is now gay.

-   "_Chuck_ vs the Cougars" has the team attend the high school reunion of gorgeous superspy Sarah Walker, aka ugly duckling Jenny Burton. (School mascot: The Cougars. Dating older women does not come up.) Nicole Richie plays the Alpha Bitch (still a bitch) who married the biggest nerd, Ben Savage (now a very important nerd). Borrows nicely from Grosse Pointe Blank with throwback music, international assassins and thugs showing up to claim the unused badges of absent classmates despite their unlikely accents, and stylized fighting in the hallways. The real draw is finally pulling back some of the veil on Sarah, who until then had managed to keep her past well under wraps. Of course, she still keeps a few secrets to herself, including a flashback cameo from a former recurring cast member...
-   Parodied in the _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ episode "Radar Secret Service". The Bots, having found Mike's yearbook, decide to throw him a reunion in order to cheer him up from the bad movie since, being trapped in space, he was forced to miss his real reunion back home.

-   _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_ features the episodes "The High School Reunion" and "The High School Reunion, Part 2: The Gang's Revenge".

He's excited to see his crush, and that motivates him to try and lose the weight he's gained since high school...while Adam explains why everything he's doing either won't work at all, or _will_ work, but only in the short term, that weight loss isn't as simple as diet culture and the weight loss industry make it out to be. He finally _gets_ to the reunion, only to find that his high school crush has gained some weight since high school (and so hasn't everyone else, and _nobody_ has put on their bathing suit)...but has also resolved to certainly take care of herself, but not worry about what people think of her body, or feel bad about herself, or put her body through ridiculous crash diets and crazy exercise regimens just to fit society's ideal. This inspires the Pinball Protagonist to do likewise, and they jump in the pool together.
-   _Martin_ episode "Really, Gina is Not My Lover" has Martin, Tommy and Cole attending their ten year reunion where Martin shows up all of the classmates who (rightfully so) hated him, Tommy ends up desperate to evade his high-school crush whose current life is a (Played for Laughs) mess and Martin ends up cold-clocking his rival who made fun of Gina, who was suffering from a severe allergic reaction due to a makeover Martin made her get and was incoherent from a painful trip to the dentist.
-   A _Living Single_ episode had the group attending a class reunion where Kyle intends on showing up a lifelong bully of his, but ends up looking like a bully himself due to the man having a pitiful life in the present.

-   One episode of _Babes in the Wood_ had Caralyn being invited to a school reunion at her old school in Worthing.

The lies work, with Nichola becoming friendly with Caralyn, and Caralyn ends up protecting Nichola from her spouse Steve when he tries to remove her from the reunion.
-   _Supernatural_. In "Seven Time For A Wedding", a crossroad demon says he always finds rich pickings at these events, as people are desperate to impress "the nostalgically bangable head cheerleader" they went to school with.

    Music

-   The Music Video of High School Never Ends: Bowling for Soup was picked on then, and use the reunion to get back for several incidents from High School.
-   "The Class of '57" by The Statler Brothers serves as a musical version of a reunion, catching up with who became a teacher, who became a car salesman, who became extremely rich (John, the Cattle Baron, Charlotte marrying a multi-millionaire) and who fared not so well (Randy wound up institutionalized, Freddie committed suicide), and who completely fell off the radar ("_Where Mavis finally wound up is anybody's bet_"). Said to be inspired by an episode of _Ironside (1967)_ (the episode, which aired a year earlier, had that very title), songwriters Don and Harold Reid have said that when they began writing the lyrics, they recalled some of their old classmates and what they knew them to be doing now. Some were real, others were made up … although they have repeatedly said that their departed classmate, Freddie, actually did kill himself. (Although it's unknown whether it was the result of "_Joe took Freddie's wife_.") The refrains summed things up well:
    
    And the class of '57 had its dreams,
    
    But livin' life day by day is never like it seems,
    
    Things get complicated when you get past 18,
    
    But the class of '57 had its dreams.

    It's the final call to judgment,  
    It's the sum of all my fears,  
    It's the single invitation  
    I've been running from for years,  
    It's the summons to appear before  
    The jury of my peers—

The only ones who are missing are Mark (who's overseas) and Ayase.

-   In one story arc of _Something\*Positive_, Devan went to his school reunion despite his initial reluctance, and it showed a full range of braggarts and losers desperate to cling to their old High School Fame (such as one woman that got surgery so she can still fit into her prom dress).

(The dolled-up Nerdrotica employee would be Nancy in her first appearance.)
-   Cassie in _Times Like This_ went to her class reunion, only to find out she wasn't remembered for much, just a lackluster graduation speech. The storyline begins here.
