Hurray! The heroes have captured the murderer and locked him away, and the day is saved.

So why is he getting all this fan mail?

The Monster Fangirl (and this is almost Always Female, though the genders may be flipped) might have the belief that Love Redeems, or she's In Love with Your Carnage (in the worst case), or believes that he's really innocent. If she's aware of his evil nature, it's essentially a form of All Girls Want Bad Boys.

Their fate is usually to be casually discarded to wind up another victim or to go to jail for the crimes they commit to aid the Monster, often screaming declarations of love all the way. As a villain is not always redeemed, the woman's deluded attraction to the dangerous psychopath may also be a romantic manifestation of Too Dumb to Live.

Depressingly, this occurs even in Real Life. In medicine, this is sometimes called hybristophilia, a paraphilia in which one is sexually aroused by the fact that somebody has committed a heinous crime.

Compare Draco in Leather Pants, and to a lesser extent, Rooting for the Empire for when the fandom does it. See also Psycho Supporter, Nightmare Fetishist, and Horrible Judge of Character. For a fangirl of a _literal_ monster in a relationship with one, see Interspecies Romance, Beast and Beauty, or You Sexy Beast.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Death Note_:
    -   Light Yagami founds over half his schemes on these people. Misa Amane had some potential as a less-polished monster in her own right, as a less brilliant and histrionic psychopath instead of a genius narcissistic one, but decided to slave her entire being to his will on first meeting, and never wavered, and without that his plan to defeat L would never have begun to exist. His final big scheme also relies heavily on Disposable Woman Kiyomi Takada, a college girlfriend turned news anchor whose response to the revelation that he is Kira is not visceral horror but infatuation.
    -   The rest of the Kira fans who keep him in names and faces to kill (yay fact-checking!) and cheer and all, and also his eventual right arm Teru Mikami, are a bigenderal hydra of this phenomenon stretching across the world. Even after the Villain with Good Publicity is exposed and declawed and killed, he still has a huge _cult_. This series is founded upon existential despair.
-   Lummy from _Fairy Tail_ is completely head-over-heels with Mad Bomber Jackal, a reflection of how fans became so enamored with him despite how he's nothing more than an irredeemable killer; on another note, she also changed Beast Man Tempester into a dark-skinned blonde Bishōnen to suit her tastes. Deconstructed when her swooning gets on Jackal's last nerve, driving him to blow her to smithereens.

    Comic Books 

-   Batman:
    -   Harley Quinn is the girlfriend of The Joker, an infamous homicidal clown who terrorizes Gotham City. Harley was originally the Joker's psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum until she suffered a major case of Critical Psychoanalysis Failure, being manipulated by the clown into falling in love with him. Harley is insanely devoted to the Joker, despite him being a violent psychopath who is terribly abusive to her.
    -   After Harley ditched the Joker for good, the clown prince of crime got himself a new right-hand woman with Alexis Kaye AKA Punchline. A college student who got held hostage by the Joker during an attack on a TV Station, Alexis's infatuation with him eventually grew into an unhealthy obsession as she developed her own Joker-inspired attire and began to randomly poison people around Gotham in order to catch the Joker's attention. The Monster Clown saw potential in her and taught her a modified version of Joker Venom that Alexis tested on the homeless. Punchline finally proved herself to the Joker after she murdered the dean of her college. Additionally, she believes herself to be Harley's Superior Successor and apparently the Joker actually likes her and treats her better compared to his former henchgirl.
-   _Judge Dredd_: The lead-up to the "Necropolis" arc had a rather tragic justified example. After a woman barely survives an encounter with Judge Death, a psychopathic Omnicidal Maniac from another dimension, it creates a psychic link between the two. She basically becomes a smitten fangirl of Death and dreams about becoming his bride. She then helps his allies Phobia and Nausea to cross the dimensional span into Mega City One by sacrificing her husband, for which Death rewards her by ripping out her heart.
-   In the first part of the _Maximum Carnage_ storyline, Carnage was in the middle of his latest rampage within the maximum-security facility he had been sent to when to his disbelief, he gained a cheering section. Of course, the fan, in this case, was fellow inmate Shriek, who was almost as sociopathic as he was, but they would become partners as a result.
-   Issue 3 of the mini-series _Star Wars Vader Dark Visions_ features a mentally unstable nurse on board a Star Destroyer who falls in love with _Darth Vader_. Her delusional mind even conjures up fantasies about them straight out of a cheesy romance novel and somehow convinces herself that his every act of murder and violence against a crewman is somehow showing his love for her. It ends exactly how you expect, really, but sneaking into his quarters _while he has his armor off_ is a new kind of stupid.
-   In one of his limited series, _Venom_ gains a crowd of child admirers on Halloween (one wearing a Spider-Man costume, ironically) after saving one from a mugger - the fact that he _brutally killed_ the mugger is lost on them. He might have even given one an autograph if the police weren't coming.

    Fan Works 

-   Sabrina in _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_ is revealed to have been this as a child. At one point, she wrote a school essay about a person she admired. Her chosen subject was Twenty Gyarados Bill, a notorious criminal whose titular Gyarados devastated the coast of Johto and the reason why the six active Pokémon limit was established. While she doesn't deny he's a mass murderer, she tries to highlight his more positive traits, describing him as "a shining example of self-improvement through hard work and determination".
-   Male examples: in _The Simpsons_ fanfiction _The Yellow Mile_, a grown-up Maggie, who is on death row after killing one of the gangsters who murdered her parents, briefly contemplates the number of marriage proposals she's been getting.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In the opening of _Men in Black 3_, Boris the Animal escapes from his Lunar Prison when his prison mail girlfriend brings him a cake containing his lethal symbiont. The kill-crazy alien monster thanks her for her aid to him, but lets her be sucked out into space without remorse and goes back to trying to destroy Earth.
-   _Once Upon a Time in Hollywood_ shows Charles Manson's fanatical followers, many of whom are female and believe they are in love with him, and all of whom are willing to kill for him. Manson sends four of them—"Tex", "Sadie", "Katie", and "Flowerchild"—to murder everyone in Tate's house, but the plan goes Off the Rails when Dalton hears their noisy muffler and orders them off his street.
-   _The Petrified Forest_: A very rare male example in the person of Grandpa Maple, an old coot who hangs out at his family's gas station in the Arizona desert. He loves to tell the story of how Billy the Kid once took a shot at him, and he is only too thrilled when notorious gangster Duke Mantee arrives and takes them all hostage.
    
    "It certainly does feel great to have a real killer around here again."
    
-   Downplayed at the end of _The Pink Panther (1963)_ when Clouseau is framed as being the jewel thief The Phantom. He's hauled away to jail but there are legions of screaming fangirls outside.
-   In _Serial Killing 4 Dummys_, Sasha is a Goth girl obsessed with Serial Killers. When Casey expresses (mostly in jest) his ambition to become a serial killer, Sasha encourages him to pursue the ambition for real, and volunteers to be his first victim.
-   The eponymous Villain Protagonists of _Tragedy Girls_ are a variation on this trope, a pair of teenage True Crime enthusiasts whose fascination with serial killers and spree killers goes well beyond morbid curiosity into a desire to emulate the psychopaths they obsess over. The film opens with them developing a serious Broken Pedestal concerning their town's actual serial killer, Lowell, who they criticize for his sloppy technique as they kidnap him and plan to make him the scapegoat for their crimes.

    Literature 

-   _I Became the Villain the Hero Is Obsessed With_: Super Villain Egostic has an ever-growing fan club, due to a combination of forcefully broadcasting his attacks, killing supervillains instead of putting them in Card Board Prison, and not actually killing any innocents.

-   Sissi from the _Nightfall (Series)_ has become obsessed with Prince Vladimir, the Big Bad who has destroyed the world and is breeding the surviving humans for vampire food.

-   The Parker Pyne story "Have You Got Everything You Want?" by Agatha Christie has a milquetoast man arrange the theft of his wife's jewelry as he's being blackmailed over his having an affair years earlier. In actual fact, he didn't even _have_ an affair; a frightened young woman fleeing a jealous husband spent the night in his hotel room, which is enough to cause a scandal, but he's firmly advised never to reveal that, as he's only interesting to his wife if she thinks her love redeemed a criminal.

-   In the _Law & Order: Criminal Intent_ episode "Seizure": Kevin Reddick, a death row inmate known as the Motel Ripper, attracted these, including a research scientist he manipulated into committing a copycat killing. Her boss Dr. Buckman set things in motion to exculpate Reddick because his PET scan showed Reddick did not have a lesion in his brain, which would have discredited Buckman's theory about rage killers. The research scientist, on the other hand, _did_ have the lesion.
