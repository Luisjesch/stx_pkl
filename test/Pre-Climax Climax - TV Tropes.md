**Boy:** We've got to get out of here, babe. There's a psychopath on the loose!  
**Girl:** Don't you want to bone one last time before you die?  
**Boy:** Definitely!  
\[_Both scream as psycho attacks wielding four flame-sprouting chainsaws_\]

Knowing that they are about to face the final battle or some other potentially deadly or at least terrifying experience, two people finally consummate their affair. More loosely, it can be any character or characters having sex before some climactic moment in the story.

If at least one of the characters in question is a virgin, then the subtrope Must Not Die a Virgin applies, as an additional sense of urgency is present.

If one of them is then killed during the final battle, there's a good chance the heroine will be left with Someone to Remember Him By.

If both of them do unexpectedly survive, it may result in a Relationship Upgrade or an (often comedic) That Didn't Happen.

In Real Life, sex before strenuous or stressful activity is usually not encouraged because of the energy that sex supposedly uses up (this is especially true in the world of sports, where athletes often believe that having sex the night before a game will negatively affect their performance). There is no scientific evidence for this. There is even a contrary theory suggesting that the hormone surge could improve subsequent performance. Even so, sometimes Truth in Television: natural selection in the tribal days may have encouraged an instinct for such conduct because those who have sex before battle are more likely to reproduce and leave descendants than those who don't.

The reverse case, where the sex comes as a celebration of the fact that both characters survived whatever it was, is Glad-to-Be-Alive Sex. If they not only survived the battle but emerged victoriously, it's Victory Sex.

Has nothing to do with Ending Fatigue.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Megazone 23_ part 1. Shogo has sex with Yui before going off to probably die (though he ends up surviving for the sequel).
-   Though not right before the climax of the story, _Ragnarok the Animation_ gives us a suggestive scene between Iruga and Judia while she's tending to his poisoned wounds. Fast-forward to the epilogue, where she's holding a grey-haired baby.
-   In _Future Diary_, Yukiteru and Yuno "become one" in the middle of the world starting to end around them. Right after they have sex, Yukki says something to Yuno that triggers the final battle.
-   Implied to have been done between Goku and Chi-Chi in _Dragon Ball Z_, right before the Cell Games. Goten is the result of that.
-   Panty and Brief in the last episode of _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_.
-   In _Otaku no Musume-san_, Haruka gets some alone-time with Kouta right before he goes to confront Nozomi who has just kidnapped Kanau away from his custody. Though Haruka didn't do this because they knew a climactic confrontation was coming but rather to snap Kouta out of his Heroic BSoD over that whole sequence of events. Exactly how far Haruka went was left ambiguous until the Distant Finale when she's shown a couple of years later with a toddler son with Kouta's distinctive huge eyebrows.
-   _Princess Lover!_: In the H-OVA, Sylvia makes plans to return home to help defend her kingdom, after learning they were at war with the neighboring Principality. Since she knew she'd be risking her life, she allows her fiance, Teppei, to have his way with her the entire night. She departs early the following morning, entrusting Teppei's maid, Yuu, to satisfy his urges until her return.
-   In _Shaman King_, it's implied that Yoh and Anna had sex the night before Yoh leaves for the Shaman Tournament. Presumably, Anna did this so Yoh would leave a child behind should he perish during the tournament.
-   In _Overlord (2012)_ Crusch and Zaryusu have sex before the battle against Cocytus since Crusch wants to have Zaryusu's child and knows he will probably die. Ainz accidentally spies on them with a magic mirror during the act and the trope is lampshaded.
-   Taken to an extreme in _Kengan Ashura_. One of the participants of the Annihilation Tournament, where matches are no-holds-barred and death is a clear possibility, is Muteba Gizenga, who spends pretty much all his time before each match having sex with as many women as possible. Up to leaving a trail of women he just had quick sex with, from his room all the way to the arena entrance.
-   In _Tales of Wedding Rings_, the party makes camp just outside the Abyss King's domain. With the final battle looming on the horizon, everyone else clears out to give Krystal and Satou some privacy. The two of them spend the night making love.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Captain Atom_ issue 50, Cap and Plastique finally make love for the first time on the eve of the final battle with the Faceless One and his henchmen.
-   Before a climactic battle in _ElfQuest_ the Go-Backs, Wolfriders, Rayek and Leetah partake in a mass orgy. This is a tradition among the Go-Backs before major battles. Elves have very slow reproductive rates, so the orgy increases the odds of more children being born to replace the fallen.
-   This trope is defied in _Uncanny X-Men_ by Colossus and Kitty Pryde. Kitty had been infatuated with Colossus for a long time, so when they hear the news that both are infected with an alien parasite and will soon die if they don't find a cure, Kitty offers herself completely to Colossus but he rejects her, not because he didn't want to do it but because Kitty was still an underage teenager at the time and the act wouldn't have been correct no matter if they were going to die or not. However, the trope is played straight years later in Astonishing X-Men when Kitty, an adult woman now, offers herself to Colossus again, one day before going into battle to save the alien planet Breakworld, and this time he accepts.
-   Iron Man and Black Widow apparently bump uglies just before the big climactic fight at the end of the first Ultimates series.
-   In Issue #5 of the Kieron Gillen/Ryan Kelly comic, _Three_ (a sort-of Spiritual Antithesis to _300_), the titular escaped Helot slaves are trapped in a cave in a dead-end canyon. Terpander (in the armor of a stray Spartan killed in the previous) holds off the pursuing Spartans in the mouth of the cave, giving Klaros and Damar a last moment together. Klaros and Terpander are both eventually killed by the Spartans. Damar escapes to Messene and gives birth to twins she names Klaros and Terpander.

    Fan Works 

-   _A Crown of Stars_: Asuka and Shinji partied and slept together before the Final Battle in order to not have any regrets.
-   _Advice and Trust_: In chapter 3 Shinji and Asuka made love for the first time since Asuka did not want to have any regrets in the next battle.
    
    **Asuka**: "I don't care about protection, not right now. I could have died in there, more alone than anyone has ever been. You're already closer to me than anyone else has ever been. I want every bond between us we can have. You gave me strength in there. I want you, Shinji. All of you. Tonight." She brought her hand up to stroke his face. "We're alive, together, and... in love. I love you, Shinji. I want to be yours."
    
-   _The Flash Sentry Chronicles:_ In the first chapter of Season 8, Flash Sentry finally gets a chance to speak to Flash Magnus, and explains to him how his dad says their family can trace their roots all the way back to him, which would make Magnus his ancestor. Magnus is skeptical at first, since he claims he never had kids of his own, until he remembers that the day before he and the Pillars of Equestria faced the Pony of Shadows and were all sealed in Limbo he slept with his lover, Sparkling Effervescence. They assume that she must have gotten pregnant from this and continued Magnus' bloodline, with Magnus accepting Sentry as his descendant.
-   At the beginning of the final arc of _Supergirl_ fanfic _Hellsister Trilogy_, Kara and Dev have pre-mission sex just in case.
    
    She stood up. "I’ll give you my answer in bed."  
    He got to his feet. "Probably be the best answer I’ll get all week."  
    "Maybe not, if you’re lucky." She took his hand again and they headed for the downlift. "But it might be our last chance for a while."  
    And if we’re not lucky this time, she thought, it might be the last chance in our lives.
    
-   _The Second Try_: Shinji and Asuka spent together in NERV's locker room the night before their final battle against the JSSDF and SEELE's MP-Evas.
-   In _Stars Above_, Kagami and Homura spend the night together before the final battle.

-   _Break My Heart, Break Your Heart_, an Overwatch fic, has Amélie and Tracer spend a night together before the team's final effort to kill Reaper for good. The chapter is called "Sex".
-   _A New Hope (Danganronpa)_: Shortly before the final trial is to begin, Kaede and Shuichi spend some time together, both to destress and because they want to have their love consummated in case they don't make it out alive. They do make it out alive.
-   _Sixes and Sevens_: Abraham van Helsing and Victoria Vladimirescu have a brief moment before their fight with Velanna where he doesn't have the Mask of Death stuck to his face, and take that opportunity to consummate their growing attraction to each other.

    Film — Live-Action

-   In _Dogma_, Bethany promises Jay that she'd have sex with him if they were about to die and there were only five minutes left to live. This is mentioned again towards the end of the film as Loki and Bartleby attempt to execute their plan to destroy all reality; Jay tells a shocked Bethany, "I'd say we've got about five minutes left to live; the whole world's going to end. You said you'd fuck me."
-   This is the premise of the song "Let's Do It For Our Country" in _Grease 2_
-   More or less a staple of the _James Bond_ series.
-   _Four Days in September_: Maria, the leader of the left-wing terrorist cell, rejects a kiss from Fernando. But a few hours before the 10 pm deadline, when they'll have to kill the ambassador they kidnapped, Maria gets much more emotionally vulnerable. She invites Fernando into her room and they have sex.
-   _The Quick and the Dead_. Lady returns to the town of Redemption to take on the Big Bad, a superior gunfighter.

    **Cort:** Why are you doing this to me?  
    **Lady:** Because we both could be dead tomorrow.
    
-   _Salt_. Salt uses an implied version of this trope in an attempt to get Nikolai Tarkovsky to let her inside the room where he's about to launch nuclear Armageddon. It almost works.
-   _The Terminator_: Reese and Sarah Connor made love a few hours before their final confrontation against T-800 (which leads to Kyle's death), and their son was created because of it.
-   _Transporter 3_ involves Frank Martin and Valentina forced to deliver a package or their Explosive Leash will explode. Valentina figures they're both going to get killed, so why not one last bang of their own? Despite having just survived a dangerous Car Chase Frank is definitely not in the mood.
-   _The Soldier_: The Soldier (the leader of a Heroes RUS group) has a plan that will either avert war in the Middle East or, if it goes wrong, start World War III.

During this, a girl who previously showed no interest in Peter, Mystique, shows up and says him being king is very hot. He's then dragged into a tent by her, with the chance to have sex with an absolutely stunning woman, even given the chance for her to shapeshift features before they get it on such as a larger pair of breasts, a huge ass, and a bandonkadonk... granted, he follows those up with the requests of a monobrow and "big flabby grandma arms"/"bingo wings like a fat blur Britney Spears" causing her to look like an obese disgusting grandmother... but both Peter and Mystique seemed quite into it as they 'sloppily made out'' before going all the way with each other all night long, with both seemingly having a great time as they moaned together.
-   _Spies Like Us_. After realising that they appear to have started World War Three, Emmett Fitz-Hume suggests to Karen Boyer that they go Out with a Bang. She says that any other time she'd tell him to go to hell, but considering the circumstances she agrees to go into a tent with him. This leaves The Squadette with two other Soviet soldiers plus Austin Millbarge, who naturally assumes she'll pick one of her fellow Soviets...only for both men to go into a tent together. That leaves Millbarge and the Soviet woman eyeing each other shyly...

    Literature 

-   In _The Dresden Files_ novel _Death Masks_, Harry and Susan have sex prior to Harry setting off to confront both of the novel's villains. The timing is problematic, however, because Susan, being a partially-turned vampire, is losing control of her bloodlust, and she and Harry are locked in his house (long story; demons, entropy curses, thousand-year-old holy artifacts, and one hell of an active magical defense system were involved). So, Harry has to substitute one lust for another. And this one encounter has pretty long-reaching consequences. This is what causes the events of _Changes_.
-   In _On the Edge_, Rose tries to argue with Declan that she should be the one to risk her life, not him. Declan's fascination with her lips is not related to what she's saying. Finally, they compromise that both of them will go together, and he carries her into the bedroom for a pre-death-defying-last-stand romp.
-   Also averted, in flashback, in _The Great Gatsby_. Daisy tried to go to New York to see Gatsby before he shipped out, but her parents stopped her.
-   In _Stephen King_'s short story _The Raft_, two of the characters have sex on the titular raft shortly before the girl is killed by the creature in the lake in a spectacularly nasty fashion.
-   In _Shadow Kiss_, Dimitri and Rose get it on before the final battle with the Strigoi.
-   _Star Wars Legends_:
    -   _X-Wing Series_:
        -   Spoofed in _Rogue Squadron_, Mirax and Corran, after growing closer together, have a last exchange before he goes on a dangerous mission, and he says he might not come back. Mirax archly tells him that if he's looking to use a Tomorrow We May Die line to get her to bed him, it's a little late for that, and he should have used it last night.
        -   A variation in _The Bacta War_, when Mirax and Corran decide to get married right before the Battle of Thyferra.
    -   Also spoofed in _Death Star_. A pilot named Villain Dance uses the "I might die tomorrow" line as an ironic pickup line, knowing the woman he's talking to can see right through it.
-   Averted in _Stark_, the comedy by Ben Elton. Despite the impending end of the world from Total Toxic Overload, CD is completely unable to convince the beautiful Rachel to sleep with him.
-   Narrowly averted in _A Tree Grows in Brooklyn_ — Francie has a brief romance with a soldier who tries to get her into bed with a "could be my last night in America and I've never been with someone I love" story, but she reluctantly turns him down, and he goes home to see his mother and fiancée instead. Later it seems he wasn't quite in the emotional crisis he professed to be, but Francie still wishes she'd slept with him because she knows she'll never feel that way about anyone again.
-   _Eye of the Needle_. War has broken out with Germany so a landlady decides to go up to the room of her handsome lodger before the Luftwaffe comes to kill them all with their poison gas bombs. Unfortunately he's a German spy operating a radio transmitter and so he kills her.
-   _Bazil Broketail_: Minanswa has sex with Relkin before the battle against the Sephists resumes, knowing they both may die.
-   In _The Peking Target_, Quiller and a female soldier parachute into the mountains near their target, but the woman breaks her leg. Carrying her to safety means abandoning the mission so she orders Quiller to kill her, but as a Last Request asks him to have sex with her first.
-   In Svetlana Alexievich’s _The Unwomanly Face Of War_, one of the interviewees mentions an incident where a group of soldiers had to break out of German encirclement and some female soldiers slept each of them in turn. The Soviet censor refused to allow this anecdote because their women were nothing like that.
-   _The Oleander Sword_: Malini and Priya roll in the sheets partway through, a while before the major showdown of the book.
-   In _The City Who Fought_, Channa and Amos finally get to have sex just before the Kolnari invade, with Channa even hearing that there are forty-odd minutes before their ships dock and deciding that's enough time to finish - marking a climax to the rising tension of the Kolnari approach. Later in the book, shortly before the inhabitants of the Space Station finally rise up in open defiance of the invaders, Channa decides to have sex with their Smug Snake leader, partially to pass a disease to him and partially because she's curious. He takes about twenty minutes and she finds it tiring and dull, as he's not concerned about anything but his own ego and spreading the Divine Seed.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the mini-series _Nineteen Fifteen_, the two couples consummate their relationships before the boys ship off to World War I. One of the girls becomes pregnant.
-   A PG version was used in the Civil War-era miniseries _The Blue and the Gray_. The brother of the main character, a member of the Virginia militia, talks privately with the girl he's courting about what may happen in the war and that his last thought would be their kiss. After she replies that she's never kissed him, he convinces her to do so. Minutes later, his younger brother (who had been eavesdropping) tries the same with another girl at the family's Christmas party. She replies that if she wanted her to kiss him, he should have just said so.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   In "Surprise", it's mentioned that Slayers tend not to live very long, which is yet another incentive for Buffy to lose her virginity with Angel when there's also an apocalyptic threat hanging over them. Ironically that puts her life in danger in a very different way.
    -   In "Graduation Day Part 1", Oz and Willow make love for the first time on the eve of the final battle with the Mayor.
    -   In "The Gift", Xander and Anya before the final battle with Glory, though not for the first time.
    -   Joss loves this one; this trope was actually the whole basis of the episode "Touched" near the end of the series, with even a bit of Deconstruction by the incorporeal First. Though it was still a few episodes from the final battle, the stress of a half-season-long war resulted in Willow and Kennedy having sex for the first time, Robin and Faith hooking up, and Anya and Xander having sex despite being technically broken up, all at the same time (and rather noisily, too). As for Spike and Buffy, they just held each other through the night. Aw.
-   Parodied in the _Community_ episode "Modern Warfare", in which Jeff & Britta hook up before the final climactic paint-gun battle.
-   Also used by Joss in _Dollhouse_, when Paul says that the only times Echo has "let him in" are when she's pretty sure they're going to die.
-   _Doctor Who_: Invoked by the Doctor at the end of "Extremis". Having found out about an impending Alien Invasion, he phones his companion Bill and tells her she should hook up with her lesbian crush Penny. Hilarity Ensues in the next episode when this impending romance is interrupted by the United Nations Secretary General barging in to ask the Doctor for his help.
-   Lampshaded in the _Fallen Angels_ episode "Tomorrow I Die" (based on a story by Mickey Spillane). Some people in a rural town are taken hostage by bank robbers, who send the protagonist and the Farmer's Daughter to pick up their loot, saying the other hostages will be killed if they're not back by sundown. Knowing full-well the robbers intend to kill everyone regardless, they have sex before returning.
    
    **Carol:** Have you ever read stories about people in falling airplanes? People who know their time's up so they do things... reckless things that they've always wanted to do? Well, I've wanted to do this since I was a tomboy in pigtails.
    
-   _Farscape_:
    -   In "A Human Reaction", John Crichton and Aeryn Sun are indicated to have sex for the first time when they are trapped on Earth, being hunted by malevolent anti-alien authorities, and not expecting to survive for very long. It turns out that the whole episode was a Virtual-Reality Interrogation, and although both of them were "real", it's hinted that Aeryn may have been in on the trick. This may explain why the incident is rarely mentioned afterwards, and they don't end up dating properly for a long time.
    -   In "The Flax", John and Aeryn are adrift in space and Almost Out of Oxygen, so they start tearing off their spacesuits so they can go Out with a Bang. Aeryn sounds almost disappointed when D'Argo turns up to rescue them before they can get started.
        
        **Aeryn:** Somebody's _docking?_
        
    -   In an Alternate Reality Episode John finds himself in a timeline where one of his brilliant plans didn't work and the ship about to explode with no way of escape. The only survivor is himself and Loveable Sex Maniac Chiana, who decides she wants to go Out with a Bang.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Tyrion Lannister tells Camp Follower Shae to fuck him like it's his last day on Earth because his father Lord Tywin has placed him in the vanguard for tomorrow's battle. On hearing this news, his bodyguard Bronn rushes off to find a woman as well.
    -   Arya Stark has sex with Gendry Waters right before the big battle against the White Walker army at Winterfell, after Gendry finishes her custom weapon for the fight. Arya was still a virgin at the time, so this is also an example of Must Not Die a Virgin.
-   _Lost Girl_, "Its Better To Burn Out Than Fae Away". Aware that it might be the last time they see each other, Bo and Lauren share a passionate night. In this case, there's no battle coming, but Lauren is being taken back by her asshole of a boss/owner.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ has Dr. Bashir and Ezri Dax finally hooking up before the final battle in the last episode, "What You Leave Behind". This seems to be a thing for Ezri; a few episodes earlier she'd reacted to being marooned by hooking up with Worf.
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   Done in "Heaven and Hell", except a woman (actually, an angel who has lost her "grace") suggests that to Dean, who is a little put off by the fact that it's usually _him_ who tries to do the same. It doesn't stop him, though.
    -   Subverted in "Abandon All Hope..", where Dean tries to do it with Jo, only for Jo to say that if this is really her last night on this Earth, she'll spend it with dignity.
    -   Played for Laughs in "Free To Be You And Me". Another angel, Castiel, wants to spend his last night on Earth with dignity, but Dean hauls him off to a brothel on discovering he's still a virgin. Hilarity Ensues.
-   _Survivors_: Believing everyone may die resolves two seasons of sexual tension for Anya and Tom, as she decides to have sex with him as a result.
-   _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_ has a...variant of this in the final episode of the second season. John and Cameron, who have had enough Unresolved Sexual Tension throughout the last two seasons that one needs a chainsaw to cut through it, are talking in his room. Cameron confesses her personal fears regarding her instability (in her usual blunt way), both physically due to internal damage and mentally due to damage to her processors, and then asks John to physically "check" her reactor core by using a knife to cut open Cameron's skin layer and check the reactor with his hand. The subsequent scene plays out like a nervous, virginal sexual encounter, with the intimacy, nudity (Cameron has to remove her shirt so John can cut her skin open) and dialogue making it clear that while there's no _real_ sex going on, the scene has comparable weight and significance for both of them.
-   _Titans (2018)_. Averted when Hawk is implanted with a Time Bomb set off by the number of times his heart beats, so they need to slow his heart rate to buy more time. At one point he starts making out with Dove, but she backs off for this reason. Tragically he's Killed Off for Real after the Big Bad tricks Dove into remotely detonating the bomb.

    Music 

-   Fishbone's "Party At Ground Zero," which is about World War III:

"Johnny goes to Sally's house to kiss her goodbye  
But Daddy says to spend the night  
They make love 'till the early morning light  
For tomorrow Johnny goes to fight"

    Sports 

-   UFC fighter, Ronda Rousey encourages this before a fight believing that it raises her testosterone level, thus increasing her toughness in a fight.
-   American Football League running back Cookie Gilchrist insisted that part of his prowess came from having sex right before a big game. Hall-of-Famer Ron Mix recalls asking Gilchrist about this at an AFL All-Star game. When Gilchrist confirmed, Mix followed up with "Was anyone else there?"

    Tabletop Games 

-   In the zombie-themed board game _Last Night on Earth,_ one of the cards that the Zombie controller can play on the heroes is "(This could be our) Last Night On Earth." When played, a male and female character standing on the same square "lose a turn." The only character immune is the town priest.
    -   One amusing thing about this card is that the affected characters cannot be attacked by zombies during the turn they're missing. Perhaps even the undead wouldn't want to interrupt?

    Video Games 

-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   In _Mass Effect_ where, before the narrative climax, Shepard can (assuming the player has completed all previous relationship subplot tasks) have sex with Ashley, Kaidan or Liara (depending on which character they romanced during the game).
    -   _Mass Effect 2_ has the respective new love interest before the final showdown, unless the protagonist chose to stay faithful to their _Mass Effect_ love interest (all not able to be present in 2), in which case he/she "only" gets to stare longingly at the absent love interest's picture before the final battle... something especially hard to take pre-2012 when it wasn't known, as it is now, if any of them would have a new romance scene in the third game.
    -   _Mass Effect 3_ continues the tradition. Just before the final assault on the Cerberus headquarters, which begins the endgame, Shepard can have an intimate scene with his/her partner. However, it is implied throughout dialogue elsewhere in the game that this isn't the only time during the course of the game that Shepard and his/her partner are having sex, just the only one that we see. Further, the focus of the scene is less on the inevitable off-screen copulation and more on the pressure of saving the galaxy; the sex is just something that happens at the end of the scene and isn't treated with as much fanfare as before.
    -   _Mass Effect: Andromeda_ zig-zags it: some romances, such as Suvi, have zero sex as their romance conclusion since it wouldn't fit with the vibes of her romance at that time. Others play it appropriately straight, such as Peebee, a sexually active woman who offers consequence-free sex with Ryder mid-way into her storyline.
-   _Double Homework_ gives one of these, and in a _threesome_, no less. In anticipation of the final confrontation with Dennis and Dr. Mosely/Zeta, the protagonist, Johanna, and Tamara all have fun together.
-   Lucas and Carla do just this near the end of _Fahrenheit_, both of them under the belief that the next day may very well be the last of their lives. This becomes particularly squicky when you realize that Carla and Lucas have shown absolutely no romantic attraction towards one another in the past and that Lucas is essentially a reanimated corpse. This also becomes a plot-point in the end, when the end-game narration mentions that Lucas managed to actually inseminate Carla, and their child has been exposed to the Chroma source in the womb, so their child may very well be the next savior of mankind.
-   _Fate/stay night_: In the "Fate" route, Shirou and Saber (who has finally come to accept his feelings for her) have sex after they survive their encounter with Gilgamesh, knowing they likely won't survive if they go fight him the following day. This happens in the Unlimited Blade Works route as well between Shirou and Rin.
-   A darker variety occurs in _Dragon Age: Origins_ when Morrigan asks the Warden (or the other Grey Warden if the Warden is female) to conceive a child with her so she can use a dark ritual to save their life. Though true to BioWare's long tradition the Warden will have an intimate scene with his/her love interest regardless of whether that happens.
-   _Knight Bewitched_: Ruth and Gwen spend the night together after Ruth is freed from her curse. This is immediately before Typhus' castle re-appears for a fight. When they return, Malady asks if they kissed and made up, to which Gwen replies they did more than that.
-   _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_: Sylvia, despite avoiding comeuppance for scamming Travis in the first game, _does_ make good on her promise to hook up with Travis, but instead of waiting for him to get to Rank 1, she visits him right before his fight with Pizza Batt, Jr.. Obviously, we don't see anything, but their lovemaking is implied to be amazing thanks to her "yoga skills". See for yourself. In addition, this causes a Relationship Upgrade from a brash and uncouth, but surprisingly gentle guy and a possessive and berating, yet sweet lady, with _tons_ of Unresolved Sexual Tension to the Official Couple. You can tell they're not just Friends with Benefits when Sylvia refers to Travis as "_my_ No More Hero". There's no word if Jeane (Sylvia's daughter who only appeared in an epilogue from the first game) is their child though.
-   _Final Fantasy VII_: If Cloud's Relationship Values with Tifa is high enough, it's implied that they have sex the night before the group enters the Northern Crater, to face Sephiroth.
-   _Neverwinter Nights 2_ has either Casavir or Elanee, depending on your character's gender, approach you and make a love confession the night after the battle at Highcliff, and the night _before_ the King of Shadows attacks your castle. The two of you end up in bed if you decide to return their affections.
-   _Demon Gaze_ has the main character and Fran sleeping together before he goes for the Demon Slayer needed to save the world. It's further confirmed in the ending who saw Fran and the MC's daughter.
-   _Divinity: Original Sin II_: The player character can have an Optional Sexual Encounter with one of their companions in the interlude before the final act, knowing they'll be hunting down the newly empowered Big Bad next. Doubles with Glad-to-Be-Alive Sex as the Big Bad just inflicted a devastating, near-lethal setback, and _may_ include a Love Confession.
-   _My Vow To My Liege_ has Fuchai ask this of Wu Zixu on the eve of their final battle.

-   In _Red String_, Kazuo and Miharu consummate their relationship after he's been ordered to dump her by his father, a very tense build-up to previous events. Although he tries to defy his father, he does dump her (without telling her why), and it completely changes the dynamic of the story.
-   In _The Order of the Stick_ this happens with Elan and Haley before the Azure City battle.
-   In the "Empress Trudy" timeline of _General Protection Fault_, Ki and Nick have such an encounter before an anticipated large battle. This results in Todd.

    Western Animation 

-   In one episode of _Futurama_, when it looks like the world is ending and solar flares are preventing them from getting off the planet, Fry and Leela decide to spend the remaining time they have doing this. Before they could, however, Amy burst in on the scene saying she figured out a way to survive.
-   _The Simpsons_: Invoked by Homer Simpson trying to help Apu & Manjula conceive by role-playing as the sort of scenario that would invoke the Law of Inverse Fertility:
    
    **Apu:** _\[reading from a script\]_ Gee, Betsy, it's such a nice night. Why don't we go all the way?  
    **Manjula:** _\[also reading\]_ But Greg, my Dad will kill me! And, you have that scholarship to Ivy League State.  
    **Apu:** Loosen up, baby. Tomorrow, I'm shipping off to Vietnam. _\[looks up\]_ I, I thought I was going to Ivy League State.  
    **Homer:** My mistake, stay in the moment.  
    **Manjula:** Just don't forget me on your dinosaur bone-digging-up trip. _\[they kiss\]_
