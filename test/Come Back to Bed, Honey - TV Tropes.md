When one partner has to go somewhere and the other wants more sex. Often used to show just how devoted a character is to the task at hand — they're refusing _sex_ in order to get on with it — while their Satellite Love Interest only has one thing on their mind. That, or it just serves to suggest the character is that good in bed. Alternately, it can lead to Coitus Uninterruptus.

A common, more chaste use is when one character gets up in the middle of the night to contemplate something (common in mystery and Urban Fantasy stories) and their significant other wakes up and asks their beloved to come back to bed, so they can sleep.

    Anime 

-   In _Macross Plus_, after Isamu and his co-worker/friend-with-benefits Lucy have had sex, Isamu is woken up by a call. He answers it but Lucy tells him to go back to be with her so he hangs up. The call was seemingly from his ex-girlfriend Myung, who has caught quite a Distress Ball and needs urgent help; Guld ends up saving her instead. However, the call was actually from _Sharon_, who was _impersonating Myung_ (who herself was trapped in a fire). She was attempting to either bring Myung and Isamu together, instigate a fight between Isamu and Guld when they both showed up to save her, or kill Myung outright; Sharon was the one who overloaded a circuit and started the fire that put Myung in danger to begin with, then attempted to kill both Myung and Guld when Isamu didn't show up. To be fair to Isamu, he didn't recognize the voice anyways, since it was a robotic message that kept repeating; he simply thought it was a prank call.
-   Misa _tries_ this with Light in _Death Note_ but he tells _her_ to get out of bed and "back to work".

    Comics 

-   In _The Secret History of The Authority_, Jenny Sparks is reminiscing about the fateful night where she saved Swift from the Nazis (and ruminating on how Bill Clinton is exactly like Adolf Hitler) when Swift comes down and tells her to come back to bed.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Relax,_ the protagonist tries to get out of bed when his session with the prostitute expires. She lets him spend the night with her anyway.
-   The _Spy X Family_, NSFW doujin, "Spy x Sex" revolves around Yuri being jealous that his sister, Yor, is married to Loid, so he bugged their apartment to gather evidence that Loid is an abusive husband, and Yuri intends to use that evidence to have his brother-in-law arrested and executed. Loid is more concerned Yuri's trying to expose him as Twilight, but can't disable the microphones or he'll blow his cover as a foreign spy. To get Yuri off his back, Loid asks Yor to sleep with him, and uses a small portable jammer to block the microphones' signals, thinking Yuri would freak out, turn off his radio, and blame the disruption on equipment failure when he turned it back on. However, Yor gets scared and locks herself in her room, and when Loid goes to apologize for trying to pressure her into having sex, because a break up would ruin Operation Strix, she invites him into her bedroom while wearing sexy lingerie and explains that Camilla, a coworker, told her he would leave her for another woman if he feels sexually unsatisfied, and they make love for the first time. After he chastises himself for losing focus of the mission while in throes of passion, he swears he'll go back to being Twilight, but Yor calls Loid over so he can service her again. After their second session, Loid notices the jammer ran out of power, and Yuri is shown crying inconsolably after hearing his beloved older sister and her husband doing it, and the narrating text says Yuri couldn't report to work the next day. When Loid decides to call it an evening and go back to his room, Yor pins him down to the mattress, and it's heavily implied she made him keep going for the remainder of the night, since the narrating text stated he couldn't go to work the next day either.

-   In _The Incredibles_, when Bob is heading to work his wife pulls him back once he's already _out the door_, using her elastic arms. This is presumably as close as a family film could get to hinting at Elastigirl "using her powers in the bedroom".
