The (il)logical conclusion of Anti-Intellectualism.  
(Not pictured: Human rights.)

_"You ever heard of a transorbital lobotomy? They sap the patient with electric shock, then go through the eye with an ice pick, pull out some nerve fibres. Makes the patients much more obedient. Tractable. It's barbaric. Unconscionable."_

One moment you'll see a character, chirpy, energetic, and arguing with the nurses at a mental hospital. The next day, they're quiet and compliant, drooling, emotionless — in short, Empty Shells. What took place? A lobotomy.

A lobotomy is a (thankfully, now rare) medical operation that cuts into part of a person's brain in order to treat mental illness. Lobotomies and similar drastic brain alterations are still used as last-ditch treatment for intractable epilepsy, but that's about it. In Real Life, there was little evidence that it did anything therapeutic. The most often performed procedure rarely helped; it simply destroyed random brain matter and caused the patient to suffer loss of motivation, loss of assertiveness, loss of creativity, difficulty in social situations and incontinence and could cause seizures in those who had not suffered from them before the operation. A majority of lobotomies were performed on adult women who were perceived as unstable, moody, or violent (by 1930s-1960s standards, anyway—take that as you will), but it was sometimes performed on male patients (often as an attempt to Cure Your Gays, for example), and in some cases very young children. For all these reasons, the practice was highly controversial from the outset (to the point where the Soviet Union banned it in 1950) and was gradually phased out when pharmacological treatments for mental illnesses became available in The '50s. It was still noticeably present in mental hospitals until The '80s, but only became rarer and rarer during that time.

This trope includes all instances of messing with human brains and removing brain matter and it refers to any sort of brain-tampering effect that diminishes intellect or willpower. Once seen as a perfectly humane thing to do, now treated in fiction as the standard example of medical science Gone Horribly Wrong, lobotomies in fiction are almost never presented as an actual _therapy_, but rather as a threat held over people or a means of rendering an inconvenient subject compliant and unable to threaten the one who performs it. Very rarely does it appear as a genuine attempt to treat the patient—not even a lesser of two evils like it was often presented in real life. Dr. Walter Freeman, one of the chief proponents of lobotomy, often shared before-and-after photos of patients depicting the "before" as agitated or disturbed-looking, and the "after" as smiling vacantly, occasionally with a note about a violent patient becoming a "perfect household pet" (with it being unclear if he meant "the darling of the household" or essentially reduced to actual animalistic status!), but fictional proponents rarely provide even _that_ much dubious reassurance. Also, while many real-life lobotomies went in through the eye socket and used a thin, icepick-like tool to punch through a thin layer of bone to get to the brain, in fiction it's far more common for a character to be subjected to the older transcranial lobotomy that involves cutting into the top of the skull—the better to show the damage to the audience via the huge, visible scar and frequently poorly-shaven head that goes along with that—though some stories, like the original book of _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_, instead go for the icepick method and show the damage via the victim's black eyes.

See Electroconvulsive Therapy Is Torture for another mental health treatment that is often presented as mind-destroying in fiction. (However, unlike lobotomy, electroconvulsive therapy actually can be beneficial in real life and is regularly consented to by patients for whom other therapies such as medication don't work, while lobotomy is basically never performed anymore.)

Contrast with Laser-Guided Amnesia which is a relatively mild thing in fictionland you can do to inconvenient witnesses. See also Brainwashed, Brainwashed and Crazy, Death of Personality, and Mind Rape.

Mad Scientists and Deadly Doctors are likely to perform it, and the Psycho Psychologist is another deadly figure who may suggest this procedure.

**Realizing that a character underwent a Lobotomy might very often come off as a Spoiler Trope. Beware!**

-   In _Superman vs. the Elite_, Superman tells Manchester Black that he used a combination of his x-ray, microscopic and heat vision powers to De-power him by burning out the part of his brain that controls his powers. In a deviation from the source material, while the flash-bang that concussed Black and prevented him from using his powers in the comic still appears, it's left ambiguous whether the loss of his powers was caused by this or if Superman is telling the truth. However, if Superman did lobotomize Black, it doesn't seem to have changed his personality as lobotomies traditionally do, and it's implied not to be permanent, making it more morally acceptable than it would be otherwise.
    
    **Superman:** Heat vision. Focused through your pupil like a scalpel. _Instant_ lobotomy.
    
-   In _Batman: Gotham by Gaslight_, Hugo Strange promotes it as a treatment. Fair for Its Day, considering the setting.

-   _From the New World_: The queerats perform a botched lobotomy on the Robber Fly queen, and presumably the queens of the colonies that allied with the Robber Flies. Squealer claimed they did it because the queen was suffering from mental illness, as well as because they felt their rights as sentient beings weren't being respected, but mainly to organize a coup. This procedure changes the queerat queens from occasionally violent, tyrannical despots to mindless baby-factories which are treated as livestock. Regardless of rationale, Saki and Satoru are reasonably freaked-out by this revelation.
-   Memoir _My Lobotomy_ by Howard Dully: The author is a troubled youth as a 12-year-old boy in 1960, in and out of trouble at school and home. When his stepmother looks for a solution, Dr. Freeman, one of the popularizers of the technique, suggests a lobotomy, and it occurs. The book discusses how many patients were killed or injured by the technique and implies that the author would have been diagnosed with ADD.
-   There is a book series by Nancy Holder called _Possessions_ about a girls' boarding school haunted by victims of an insane asylum where lobotomies were practised.
-   In Norbert Wiener's short story "The Brain", a gangster costs a doctor his family with his driving (they do not die... not immediately). Some time later, the gangster's mooks summon the doctor to perform urgent surgery on the gangster, who got hit in the head (allegedly in a car crash). During the next robbery, the gangster and all his gang are killed due to a complete lack of planning.
-   _His Dark Materials_: The General Oblation Board develops a procedure called intercision, which severs a person from their dæmon/soul and has a similar effect on the person as being lobotomized.

-   The novel _Geek Love_ by Katherine Dunn features a pair of Conjoined Twins, Iphy and Elly. Eventually their brother Arty has Elly lobotomized.

-   In Alan Garner's _Boneland_, Colin is threatened with electro-convulsive therapy and "sectioning", ie this being done to him without his consent, is also mentioned.

He is later seen apparently walking up in hospital and offered a drink, with a nurse wiping excess from his beard.

Having survived World War III, he seeks to identify the causes of aggression.
-   Amoridere's _Compliance_ implies this happens to subject, who was mentioned to be "defiant" and became an Empty Shell after being "fixed". The image that goes with the poem confirms it, as the subject is shown with scar and a bald spot. A later poem, _Catatonic Bliss_ alludes to this again, where the subject (who's not in a good place) would rather be lobotomised (or close to it) than to deal with her situation.

-   River in _Firefly_ had parts of her brain removed, removing her ability to suppress her emotions. She was a genius child and abused by the controlling Alliance, who experimented on children like her. The programme was a bit shady and it was not clear why they did it. In _Serenity_, it was revealed they wanted to turn them into Super Soldiers.
-   An episode of _Law & Order: Criminal Intent_ had the villain drilling a hole in random women's heads and pouring in boiling water. Most of them die. Interestingly while most of the team consider him a horrific monster, he's shown as more pathetic than scary or evil. Goren tries very hard to get him life in prison rather than the death penalty. It doesn't end well.
-   President Cyclops, in the TV version of _Whoops Apocalypse_, declares: "If anyone tries to lobotomize me, they'll get a piece of my mind." This doesn't prevent the Soviets planting a lie detector in his brain.
-   The first "Mr. Gumby" on _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ acquired his distinctive slow, loud speech and clumsy violent movements after a lobotomy (probably why the handkerchief over the head).
-   _Fringe_: The backstory for Walter Bishop is that he got per his request parts of his brain removed then committed to a mental institution because his amoral Mad Scientist actions were threatening reality. The operation turned him into a friendlier Cloudcuckoolander.

-   Dr Arden from _American Horror Story: Asylum_ gives a lobotomy to a patient who recognized him as a Nazi war criminal.
-   _Monday Mornings_ has a rare positive portrayal from a 2013 Medical Drama, but treated extremely seriously. Dr. Ridgeway, a brilliant neurosurgeon, sees no other way than a radical treatment for one of her patients — removing several brain cells. It's risky and her colleagues point out both to Ridgeway and the patient's family that it's still brain matter removal, albeit delicate and precise. They actually use the word "lobotomy", and it gets mentioned than one patient who underwent a similar procedure in Europe turned into a violent criminal.
-   Occurs in the infamously So Bad, It's Good _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Spock's Brain", in which aliens, to put it simply, steal Spock's brain, and the episode revolves around the _Enterprise_ crew getting it back and reattaching it.
-   The _Space: Above and Beyond_ episode "Stay with the Dead", Nathan is threatened with a Sci-Fi version of a lobotomy (stated to be electroshock therapy but depicted as some form of neurosurgery) because he insists his squadron mates are alive when everyone else has written them off. They are, and he manages to convince his CO before doctors carry out the procedure.
-   Sylar tampered with brains of _many_ people in _Heroes_. Charlie Andrews, sort of Bridget Bailey, Brian Davies, Sue Landers, Joe Macon, Dale Smither, Ted Sprague, Tom Miller, Jesse Murphy, Candice Willmer, Zane Taylor, James Walker, Trevor Zaitlan, Bob Bishop, Isaac Mendez, possibly David, and a random man and woman that work at The Company. Plus, with every person he kills, he gains a power. What's really evil is that he doesn't actually need to kill his victims to take their power. He just likes doing it. Justified as he didn't realise he could take it without killing for almost all of his victims. By the end, he has at least sixteen powers taken from the dead.
-   This is standard procedure for taming an Ood in _Doctor Who_, as shown in "Planet of the Ood". It's nowhere near as messy as a real lobotomy, though. The procedure removes a part of the brain that's _outside the body_, meaning all the surgeon does is cut the cord that attaches the external brain to the internal brain. Since the external brain contains an Ood's memory, emotions, and individuality, removing it turns the Ood into a docile, mindless slave. To make the Ood even more docile, the slavers also created a force field to cut off the Ood's mental access to the gigantic disembodied brain that would otherwise link them together in a psychic network.
-   In the _Murdoch Mysteries_ episode "Murdoch of the Living Dead", a psychiatrist named Dr. Luther Bates is revealed to have been performing lobotomies through the nose. He's experimenting with criminals and tampering with their brains. He believes that he is helping society to deal with violence and crime, but he shows to the public only people who have turned docile. Some of his victims end up Brainwashed and Crazy and extremely violent.
-   The _Cold Case_ episode "Committed" involves the Victim of the Week having received a lobotomy to try to cure her mood swings and to take the place of Carmen, an artist who was committed for not following social convention and had nothing wrong with her, in order to spare her from this awful fate. She freezes to death when she's taken outside due to her catatonic state following the procedure.

-   In _Orange Is the New Black_, episode "Doctor Psycho", flashbacks revealed that Counselor Healy's mother was involuntarily subjected to numerous lobotomies attempting to cure her hallucinations. The surgeries do little to stop the hallucinations, but they do leave her feeling as if a part of her is missing. By the end, she's revealed to be in and out of homeless shelters and mental institutions, unable to remember her real name, and presumably most of her past.
-   _Van Helsing (2016)_: In "Big Mama", a group of redneck survivors have resorted to catching and eating _vampires_. They take a chained up vampire and use a power drill on her head until she stops screaming and thrashing. Then they throw her into an oven and _she starts screaming and thrashing again_ until a horrified Julius gives her a Mercy Kill.
-   _Once Upon a Time in Wonderland_: The implied treatment the Asylum was about to give to Alice — actually, what she intentionally volunteered for at the time.

    Music 

-   Song "I'd Rather Have a Bottle in front of Me (than a Frontal Lobotomy)", referred to as a Dr. Demento classic. It's all in the title, but to recap: would you rather solve your problems with alcohol, Drowning Your Sorrows, or would you choose frontal lobotomy?
-   The song "I'd Rather Have a Bottle in Front of Me than Have to Have a Frontal Lobotomy" is referenced in Tom "T-Bone" Stankus' song, "Existential Blues".
-   The cover of Iron Maiden's "Piece Of Mind" depicts Eddie having been lobotomized (the top of his skull has been removed and reattached).
-   Discussed in the "Weird Al" Yankovic song "I Can't Watch This".
    
    HBO and Playboy, Showtime and MTV
    
    I might like them more after my lobotomy
    
-   Oingo Boingo's song "Perfect System" mentions the operation and tampering with one's brain.
    
    _"I had an operation. With no adverse reaction. They tampered with my brain some. It helped me see the reason. For living in the system."_
    
-   Emilie Autumn's song "Miss Lucy Had Some Leeches"
    
    ''Before the night is over
    
    Before you go to bed
    
    They'll take a hammer and a nail and jam it in your
    
    Headstones in the courtyard..."
    

-   The Ramones have a song called "Teenage Lobotomy" from _Rocket to Russia_, which is actually about abusing the insecticide DDT as a drug. You get the brain damage without the docility, it seems.

-   Purgatory (later renamed Iced Earth) had a song called "Lobotomy" on their first demo Burning Oasis, as well as on live bootlegs. The demo has yet to be shared online by anyone, unfortunately.
-   David Bowie alludes to the practice's use as an extreme form of conversion therapy in two different songs:
    -   In "All the Madmen", about an asylum patient aiming to avoid discharge, the narrator claims that he's bisexual during the second pre-chorus ("my libido's split on me") in the hopes that the asylum staff lobotomize him, which would make him incapable of leaving.
    -   In the anti-homophobia song "Scream Like a Baby", the protagonist, who is arrested by a fascist government for being queer, is forcibly injected with "strange drugs" that reduce him to a stuttering wreck at the end of verse two. Said stuttering additionally mimics that of Billy Bibbit in _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_, alluding to Randle McMurphy's lobotomization at the end of the film.
-   The Velvet Underground's "Lady Godiva's Operation" also touches on lobotomy's use as a form of conversion therapy, ending in the patient accidentally being killed mid-operation.
-   _The Dark Side of the Moon_ has the singer undergo one.
    
    "You raise the blade, you make the change"  
    "You re-arrange me 'til I'm sane"
    

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Daffney Unger's Bridging Swinging Fisherman's Suplex Finishing Move was called the Lobotomy. If you actually want one of those though, you were better off getting a recommendation from her "therapist" Dr Stevie, who was convinced he could save her even after she told him there was somethings in the brain psychology just can't fix.

    Role-Playing Games 

-   Wallace Bishop of _Dino Attack RPG_ is an unusual example, considering that he actually performed a lobotomy on himself after escaping Napoleon XIV Mental Institution, rather than letting one of the doctors in the institution perform the lobotomy on him. Being a former scientist, he knew exactly how to do the procedure. His goal was to remove the areas of his brain containing the memories of his family, which were making it much harder for him to cope with being institutionalized. He succeeded to such a degree that another scientist, Frank Einstein, was even able to _extract_ the memories from the removed pieces of brain, but in doing so he left himself little more than a shadow of a man.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Players of _Magic: The Gathering_ can use Lobotomy and other invasive surgery .
-   _Warhammer40000_:
    -   The most prominent example of this trope are servitors, lobotomised cyborg slaves.
    -   World Eaters (an entire army of Berserkers) have lobotomies so as to ensure they no longer feel fear. Unfortunately, those with the skill to perform this operation are increasingly rare, so a great many of them fail. Then again, given what most Chaos units are like, especially Khornate World Eaters are like... The effects are completely different than the standard pop-culture lobotomy, though, turning the affected person into The Berserker.
    -   Ork doks have been known to replace their patient's brain with a squig's. Less extreme than it sounds, as ork physiology is stupidly tough (they can survive decapitation for a while, and head transplants are entirely possible). Like the World Eaters, the results are the exact opposite of the pop-culture lobotomy: it's hard to find something more mindlessly violent than an ork, but a face-eater squig is one of the few things that qualifies!
-   _Paranoia_ supplement _Acute Paranoia_, section "Sanity Tests". When a Troubleshooter fails a Sanity Test ordered by The Computer, the game master rolls on the Handy-Dandy Sanity Tests Results Table. One of the entries in the table is "Corrective Surgery". Blue-level officers from HPD & Mind Control take the unlucky clone away and remove parts of his brain. When he returns he will have a large bandage on his head, will have lost all of his skills and have had most of his attributes halved. This being _Paranoia_, the player may decide to try to get that character killed quickly and bring in the clone replacement. However, since the game rules actively encourage the GM to cheat to reward players who are being entertaining and a character who is _trying_ to get killed can be pretty darn entertaining, that character may be around for a long, long time (at least by _Paranoia_ standards).
    -   Another mission involves a rogue robot using a similar procedure to induce chemical amnesia. The Troubleshooters eventually learn that they _created_ it to use on traitors, only for a horrified subordinate to reprogram it. He was aiming for "destroy yourself", but it interpreted it as "destroy evidence of yourself", including its creators' memories and their MemoMax backups. They were reloaded from archive backups from their Red-clearance days, and drug treatment is slowly recovering their Indigo and Violet selves. Question is, will they let the subordinate finish the job?
-   New World of Darkness sourcebook _Asylum_ is based around psychiatric care in the setting, with a sample hospital, Bishopsgate, that has operated since the 1800s. This, of course, means that it existed when lobotomies were in vogue, and so they're discussed. One head of staff in particular, Dr. Jeremiah Moorcock, was quite fond of performing them. He was removed from the hospital after an unknown assailant gave him a transorbital lobotomy.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ has the psionic power Decerebrate. From the SRD, "you selectively remove a portion of the subject's brain stem."

    Theatre 

-   In Tennessee Williams's 1958 play, _Suddenly, Last Summer_, the protagonist is threatened with a lobotomy to stop her from telling the truth about her cousin Sebastian. Fortunately, the doctor charged with the task is ethical enough to determine if she really is insane and in need of the treatment first.

    Video Games 

-   _BioShock Infinite_:
    -   If Slate's life is spared, he will be found later on in the game, the apparent victim of a lobotomy or some similar "procedure" by Comstock's forces that has left him an Empty Shell to keep him from continuing to spread dissent and treasonous information about Comstock, that happens to be both true and false, metaphorically speaking. If you put him out of his misery, then Elizabeth will comment on it, saying, "I guess that's what he wanted."
    -   In _Burial at Sea_, Atlas nearly gives Elizabeth one while torturing her for information. He even sticks the needle in and taps it a few times with a hammer. And you get to experience it all in first person! Elizabeth simply laughs it off though, saying that he'll be doing her a favor, by making her no longer care about all she's been through. He then threatens to do it to the Little Sister Elizabeth had been trying to save the whole time. She quickly gives in.
-   There's a doctor in _Psychonauts_ who removes entire brains. His name? Doctor Loboto. He's actually a dentist and removes brains whole, so they can be used to pilot psychic tanks. They're removed through an extreme form of Pepper Sneeze, and are just as easily replaced.
    -   It turns out, there's a reason for his name that isn't just his skill in clean lobotomy. He was actually subject to a lobotomy at a young age by his psychic-hating parents to "fix" him. This is implied to actually be the cause of him becoming an evil dentist, as the trauma could have caused his moral compass to go missing. You can even see his exposed brain under his shower cap!
-   In _American McGee's Alice_, there are nightmarish children wandering around some levels. Many of them have their skulls cut open, with brains exposed.
-   In _Mystery Case Files: Escape From Ravenhearst_, the Master Detective must perform a simulated lobotomy on an animatronic "mental patient" so she can beat him in a card game.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   Not physical lobotomy but, in the first installment, mages can be made Tranquil; they are cut off from the Spirit World Fade and therefore lose any ability to become a tasty demon-snack but also lose all emotions and willpower. Public use of the Rite of Tranquility was meant to be as an alternative to killing a mage who cannot or will not control their powers, tantamount to execution. However, as centuries went by, it ended up being used as Disproportionate Retribution for petty offenses, and some things that weren't even offenses but were trumped up to be. The operation is believed to be irreversible, but in _Asunder_, a Tranquil mage under the Divine's orders successfully researches a "cure" (which consists of tricking a demon or spirit into "touching" the Tranquil's mind from the Fade) — and is utterly overwhelmed by his newfound emotions, turning into a Nervous Wreck overnight.
    -   In _Dragon Age II_ when Anders, an Abomination with the Spirit of Justice/Vengeance inside him, meets an old friend named Karl who was recently made Tranquil. The sight of his now Tranquil friend infuriates Anders so much that Justice temporarily manifests itself. The presence of the spirit temporarily restores Karl's emotions. Karl begs Anders to kill him since he doesn't want to go back to his dreary emotionless state. Later in the game, it's revealed that the same man who did this to Karl has been doing it to young women in the Kirkwall Circle to render them incapable of resisting him—and another rapist threatens his victim with Tranquility to keep him from speaking out. Judging from some of Cole's revelations in _Inquisition_, they're not the only ones.
    -   It's mentioned in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ that blood magic can be used to alter people's personalities, but it is extremely likely to backfire and lobotomize the subject instead. Dorian Pavus' father was going to try this on him to turn him straight, which is why Dorian ran away from home.
-   Lobotomites are common enemies in the _Fallout: New Vegas_ add-on, Old World Blues, who have had their brains removed and replaced with imperfect Tesla coils that are meant to receive the signal from their disembodied brains but don't quite work. This fate befalls the Player Character as well, but the process is perfected on them so they stay sane. You can even opt to leave your brain, heart, and spine behind and use cybernetic implants instead.
-   Implied by MODOK in _Marvel vs. Capcom 3_ when he wins a Mirror Match:
    
    **One of his winquotes:** Never again will I forget to lobotomize one of my clones!
    
-   _Five Nights at Freddy's_: The infamous Bite of '87 from the first game. During a birthday party, one of the animatronics malfunctioned and took a chunk out of one of the people at the restaurant. Other than that, the details of it are unclear.
    
    **Phone Guy:** I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?
    
-   _BlazBlue_ has a lot of examples of messing with people's brains to various ends. The prize goes to Kokonoe in her _Chronophantasma_ arcade mode. Terumi runs on other people's hatred, so Kokonoe _performs self brain surgery_ to cut out the part of her brain that governs it. This severely weakened Terumi and she utterly destroyed him when they met face to face.
-   In _Dead Space 2_, at one point kind of late in the game, you have to guide a needle into Isaac's pupil.
-   The non-lethal method of eliminating Kirin Jindosh in _Dishonored 2_ is to lobotomize him with his own electroshock chair.
-   Fran Bow can talk to a little girl in the hospital who is heavily implied to have been lobotomized.
-   Mentioned as having been performed at the Shalebridge Cradle in _Thief: Deadly Shadows_. The head doctor's fancy silver surgical tools are a special loot item in that level.
-   The protagonist of _The Town of Light_ undergoes a transorbital lobotomy in an asylum, which is shown in graphic detail.

    Visual Novels 

-   Dr. Irie, from _Higurashi: When They Cry_ studies practices of this subject. Portrayed somewhat sympathetically, as he really is helping people. The people who pay him are much shadier, though.
-   Not actually carried out, but in _Hatoful Boyfriend Holiday Star_, when Hiyoko sees Shuu acting rather out of character she asks if he's gone and had that lobotomy.
-   During Sano's route in _Boyfriend To Death_, he'll give the MC a lobotomy if they don't acknowledge their drinking problem.
-   In _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_, it is revealed that Hajime Hinata underwent one of these at the hands of Hope's Peak Academy researchers to transform him into Izuru Kamukura, the "Ultimate Hope" who possesses every talent known to man. Hajime, having had his memories of his time at Hope's Peak erased, is understandably shocked when the Big Bad reveals this fact to him.

    Webcomics 

-   _Girl Genius_: Baron Wulfenbach's attempts to study The Spark mostly involve methodically coring out portions of his enemies' brains. One of his past patients is left with cranial scars resembling a checkerboard.
-   _Questionable Content_: On Faye's first visit to her therapist, the therapist jokingly suggests lobotomy.
-   _Team Fortress 2_: Medic reveals to Demoman that in light of the last eight times he asked to grow a replacement left eye for Demo; Only to have the new eye not stick as every Halloween Night the new eye will transform into a Monster that the Mercs will inevitably be forced into fighting due to the curse that the Bombinomicon placed on his eye-socket. Medic simply resorted to scooping out the part of Demos' brain so he'd stop asking to give him a replacement eye ever again.
    
    **Demoman:** ...Aye, fair enough. Hold on, I **did** just ask you.  
    **Medic:** I know. Sadly, brain-scooping is not an exact science.
    

    Web Original 

-   Lobotomies scored number 6 in _Cracked_ article "The 10 Most Insane Medical Practices in History". Lobotomies were a popular medical technique for the first half of the 20th century and a miraculous "cure" for nearly any mental issue from serious conditions like schizophrenia to mild anxieties or teenage angst. Read it here.
-   _Dream SMP_: While this doesn't _actually_ happen in canon, Schlatt once very casually threatened to "turn \[Quackity\] into Rosemary Kennedy" (see the Real Life section) if he didn't meet his standards of attractiveness. Really says a lot about their relationship in the roleplay series.
-   In Das Mervin's readthrough of the _Twilight Illustrated Guide_, she notes that it would have made more sense to have that Alice got a lobotomy during her involuntary stay at an insane asylum. (She withdrew that suggestion after the listeners pointed out that the time period wasn't when lobotomies were popular as medical treatment.)
-   In the Das Sporking recap of _Fifty Shades of Grey_, the sporkers speculate that Leila may have had a lobotomy, owing to the stunted and lethargic way she behaves.
-   Mephisto the Magician references a Doc Savage expy in the _Whateley Universe_ whose "delicate medical surgery" turns out to be a pre-frontal lobotomy, reducing brilliant criminal minds to mental children unable to feed themselves. Mephisto is less than amused.
-   In "Cassette #5: Focus, Nose," of _Within the Wires_, The Second-Person Narration reveals that the rare intractably violent patient will undergo "carpentry" in the Extensive Studies Lab, by way of warning her listener to maintain the appearance of compliance while an inpatient at a sinister research hospital.

-   _The Simpsons_: In "Treehouse of Horror V", Ned Flanders is global overlord and deals with any rebels by having a part of their brain removed. Lobotomized Moe shows Homer "you get to keep the little piece they cut out", and lobotomized Marge just tells Homer that "it's bliisss...".

-   _Justice League_ brings up lobotomy procedures in "A Better World", when Justice Lord Superman manages to lobotomize Doomsday, using his x-ray and heat vision for instant effect. When the others decide to check out a mental hospital in the Justice Lords universe, it's revealed that he has done it to many other villains like the Joker, Poison Ivy, and Mr. Scarface.

    Real Life 

-   Rosemary Kennedy, sister of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, was lobotomized at the age of 23 in 1941 and was left with the mental capacity of a toddler. She spent the rest of her life in mental institutions, and her condition was kept secret from the public until 1987. Her surgeon's description of it is... not pretty, though it also wasn't the trans-orbital procedure depicted at the top of the page.
    
    _We went through the top of the head, I think she was awake. She had a mild tranquilizer. I made a surgical incision in the brain through the skull. It was near the front. It was on both sides. We just made a small incision, no more than an inch." The instrument Dr. Watts used looked like a butter knife. He swung it up and down to cut brain tissue. "We put an instrument inside", he said. As Dr. Watts cut, Dr. Freeman asked Rosemary some questions. For example, he asked her to recite the Lord's Prayer or sing "God Bless America" or count backwards. ... . "We made an estimate on how far to cut based on how she responded." . ... . When she began to become incoherent, they stopped._
    
-   Tennessee Williams' sister Rose is a famous real-life case. It went badly, obviously upset Williams very deeply, and it influenced a lot of his writing. _The Glass Menagerie_ is entirely based on the incident and the characters on his family. The fact that Williams was a gay man further invited distaste towards the practice, since it was also used as a form of conversion therapy; _Suddenly, Last Summer_ targets this aspect of the practice while also connecting it to Rose's predicament.
-   The American Serial Killer Jeffrey Dahmer confessed to lobotomizing some of his victims while they were still alive, drilling holes in their skulls and _pouring in acid_ in attempts to create zombies. The process killed everyone he tried it on, though, which was probably the best possible outcome in that situation.
-   The youngest person to ever be subjected to a lobotomy was Howard Dully, at the age of twelve. Fortunately, though, his still-developing brain was capable of healing the damage, making the process entirely ineffective. He turned out pretty much fine save for some constant eye infections.
-   In 1953, Henry Gustave Molaison, publicly known as "Patient HM," voluntarily removed the medial temporal lobes of his brain in hopes of treating his severe epilepsy. While it mostly resolved that issue, the procedure left him unable to form new conscious memories (though could still form unconscious implicit memories). For the next 55 years, he was one of the most studied medical cases in the history of psychology. After his death in 2008, his brain was harvested in order to more directly study what parts of his brain had been destroyed to gain greater insights into how the brain forms memories.
-   Ricky Ray Rector gave himself a lobotomy by accident when he shot himself in the head in an attempt to avoid going to jail for murdering a police officer. Despite being left with a severely reduced mental capacity, Rector was tried anyway and sentenced to death, which caused no small amount of controversy.
-   Phineas Gage, a young railroad worker who managed to survive his tamping iron being accidentally blasted through his cheek, left eye, and brain, is popularly held up as an example of an accidental lobotomy, but it has since been disproven. For one thing, the tamping iron only passed through one lobe, and fairly cleanly, as opposed to the spot of pudding often bridging both lobes that lobotomy would create; for another, the personality changes and damage to his inhibitions Gage initially suffered after the accident made him more aggressive and short-tempered, which is the _exact opposite_ of what a lobotomy would do to someone. Despite the Urban Legend that he became an ill-tempered, violent drifter, Gage actually recovered most of his pre-accident personality and worked two steady jobs before dying from a seizure in his mid-30s, and in that 12-year period he was actually a scarred but respectable-looking young gentleman<small>◊</small>. In fact, if Gage's case contributed anything to later psychosurgery, it was hope that people who lose large chunks of their brains to tumors or other serious damage might be able to lead full lives afterward.
