_"Have you tried..._ _**not**_ _being a mutant?"_

There's a certain group of people. They have normal lives to an extent, but somehow they're _different_. Not like other people. They're something unusual. Something that means they can never fit in. If it's at all possible, they hide their differences away from everyone else to fit in. They live in secret, ostracized from society. A subculture, upholding a masquerade of being normal by day but living out a secret lifestyle out-of-view. Chances are that if they ever tell anyone, they'll inevitably be asked, "Have you tried... _not_ being a monster?"

In many cases, this trope is a way to introduce themes about minorities into a plot without being too specific about what is being referenced when creators feel that an allegory or metaphor will be less likely to be censored. In this way, the writer has room to create an effective allegory without any limitations. Though on rare occasion, there is no allegory at all: the trope is just the natural outcome of the circumstances the story is set in. This story is familiar to many real-life minorities, one prominent example being the queer/LGBT+ community, so it's not that surprising that it's so often used in fiction. Besides the queer community, similar circumstances may also apply to other persecuted groups like Jewish or disabled people, so a metaphor for one such group may be applicable to another.

If there is a stigmatized difference that is not readily apparent or can be disguised (especially one that appears when the character is old enough to hide it), chances are that characters will try to hide it to avoid being judged, and that if/when their secret is revealed, it will come as a definite shock... and invite mortal danger.

As one can imagine, this trope can have myriad Unfortunate Implications, especially if the Muggles have entirely justifiable reasons to fear the fictional entities in question, such as instinctive predatory impulses towards humans, genuinely being Always Chaotic Evil apart from the occasional angsty heroic one, or being able to blow somebody's head off by glaring at them really hard. That said, remember that Tropes Are Not Bad.
