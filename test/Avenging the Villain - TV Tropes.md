_"He was the only man capable of saving these fools from their wretched existence... And you... You murdered him!!! You shall pay! No... not just you... The whole world shall pay!"_

If the heroes have defeated a Big Bad or Evil Overlord, there is a chance that they have offspring, or a little brother, or maybe just an apprentice, who will come back to menace them in the sequel, next season, or what have you.

This isn't a trope that would be used for villains who only care about themselves, and it's pretty rare in one who'd bother becoming the Big Bad, because it shows that the villains had loved ones or people they cared about. In many cases nonetheless, the villain's brother/sister/etc. won't actually care about the deceased villain, and may or may not be out for the hero's blood for other reasons. In fact, subversions are more common than straight examples. If the character in question realizes that the slaying was accidental or justified, they might settle for Restrained Revenge, making them much more sympathetic and fair in the process.

Sometimes results in Nice Job Breaking It, Hero, if the new enemy is even more powerful than the former — plus, now? It's Personal.

Some antagonists can take it to the next level and try to Resurrect the Villain to help seek his own revenge!

-   In _Bleach_, this happens when Zommari comes to avenge Aaroniero's death by Rukia.
-   In _Chainsaw Man_, Katana Man's motivation for working for the Gun Devil to kill Denji was that Denji killed his yakuza grandfather, completely ignoring that he got himself killed stupidly putting his trust in the Zombie Devil and was already a shambling corpse by the time Denji got to him.

    -   Cooler seeks to kill Goku in _Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge_, whom he blames for Frieza's death. However, the only reason he cares is that he believes that Frieza being killed by a lowly Saiyan has brought disgrace upon their clan's name, and he makes it clear from the start that he never gave a rat's ass about Frieza either way. In the dub, he even states that if Goku hadn't killed Frieza, he would have done so himself.

Rey — a Well-Intentioned Extremist who wants to make sure that no one ever lives a life like Rau did — spends much of _SEED Destiny_ trying to off Kira Yamato, the one who killed Rau, typically ranting about how he _is_ Rau while doing so. It would seem that avenging the villain plays at least some role in Rey's motivations.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans_:
        -   Gaelio Bauduin starts out as a Gjallarhorn officer with a sense of justice. After seeing the maiming of his new friend and the death of his childhood friend at the hands of Tekkadan, he's gradually shattered into a sad and vengeful person who dedicates his life to avenging both of them.

-   _Inuyasha_:
    -   There is a challenge sent to Shippo by someone wanting to avenge Hiten and Manten, the Thunder Brothers.

-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   _Stardust Crusaders_:
        -   Enya the Hag tries to kill both Polnareff and Hol Horse for their part in her son J. Geil's death (Polnareff for killing J. Geil to avenge his sister's murder, and Hol Horse for seemingly leaving his former partner to die).
        -   When Telence introduces himself as the younger brother of D'Arby, the heroes assume that he's interested in doing this for his brother, but Telence denies this by seeing his brother as a gullible fool and deeming he was defeated by his oversight.
    -   _Diamond is Unbreakable_: A rare heroic version regarding Okuyasu Niijumura for his Big Brother Bully Keicho after he was killed by Akira Otoishi's Stand; Red Hot Chili Pepper. Though in this case, while Okuyasu is angry and wants to take down Otoishi partially out of vengeance, he is aware that Otoshi only got his powers because of Keicho recklessly firing the Stand Arrow at people in hope of finding a Stand User capable of Mercy Killing their mutated father.
    -   _Golden Wind_: The Execution Team wanted to take over Passione and corner the drug trade, but the deaths of Sorbet and Gelato were the triggering instance that fully turned them against The Boss.

-   In the _Kill la Kill_ OVA, which takes place some time after the end of the series, Rei Hououmaru (who escaped the final battle) returns in order to avenge Ragyo Kiryuin. In the end, Satsuki manages to talk her into dropping her vendetta and moving on with her life.
-   Brocken Jr., of _Kinnikuman_ infamy, originally sought revenge against Ramenman for the death of his father, Brockenman. This is despite the fact that both Junior and Ramenman were "faces" and Brockenman a "heel". Brocken Jr.'s Image Song even has him acknowledge that his father was a cheap fighter who got what he deserved, but he intends vengeance all the same. He changes his mind after Ramenman defeats him. Funnily enough, when Ramenman fought Brockenman, he himself was a monstrously brutal "heel". Not only did he needlessly kill Brockenman (in the manga, Ramenman ripped Brockenman's body _in half_), he _made him into noodles and ate him_, too. You can't blame a guy for wanting to beat the piss out of the man who murdered and ate his father for laughs, justifying a desire for revenge.

-   _Rurouni Kenshin_: Two of the other people Kenshin killed at the same night Tomoe died are the reason two of Enishi's allies are out for him. The previous group's leader has an apprentice who wants to defeat Kenshin. Not for revenge as Sanosuke assumes but because killing the one who killed his master is the only way to prove himself stronger than that master. The second one, a Sissy Villain, plays the trope straight. A friend of his, with whom he liked to compare who killed more people, was killed by Kenshin.

-   In _Samurai Champloo_, Jin killed his master Mariya Enshirou in self-defense. Try telling that to Mariya's _other_ students, who are hunting for Jin throughout the series to avenge him. Particularly notable is Not-So-Harmless Villain Ogura Bunta, who managed to hold his own against Jin when he finally encountered him. The shame of his defeat, however, caused Bunta to be Driven to Suicide, according to Jin's Unknown Rival Yukimaru. For his part, Yukimaru doesn't care about their master, and just wants to kill Jin to absorb the reputation of the thousand man killer. In an subversion, Mariya Enshirou isn't a villain. He was ordered to kill Jin (his best student) by the Shogunate. That he was killed by Jin, while Jin was half-asleep, in a flaskback is a testament to just how skilled Jin is with a katana.

And that's not even mentioning how he's the only survivor of the Ancient Dragon clan, slaughtered by the Golden Dragon clan.
-   _Speed Racer_: In the episode "The Most Dangerous Race," Speed defeats Snake Oiler and several other members of the Car Acrobatic Team in the Alpine Race. The other members of the team all crashed over the course of the race, while Snake made it to the final stretch of the course, though he then had an accident caused by an oil leak. Later, in "The Trick Race," other members of the Car Acrobatic Team seek vengeance against Speed, including Snake Oiler's brother, Kobra.
-   Adiane's main goal in _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ is avenging the death of her lover Thymilph (though the one directly responsible for his death had died in a Mutual Kill).

    -   Since Kraven the Hunter died, several previously unknown sons (both legitimate and illegitimate), and more recently a daughter, have shown up seeking revenge.

Nash believes that because she let Jack go, she's an "accomplice" in her brother's murder (while ignoring the fact that she did the exact same thing for David Knight's murder). Nash then becomes the second Mist and goes completely Ax-Crazy, becoming her father's equal in villainy. But she tops it when she rapes Jack, gets pregnant with his child, and literally tells Jack that she's going to raise their child to _despise_ Jack utterly.

It doesn't work. In the movie, Signora Andolini is killed in front of her son Vito for trying to defend his life, but Vito manages to escape.

See _Wicked_ for an even more sympathetic take on the Witch of the West.

-   The villain of the _Flashman_ novel _Royal Flash_ is an expy of Rupert of Henzau. One of the novellas in _Flashman and the Tiger_, which is set decades later, has that character's son, who has an identical appearance and personality, and uses an Older Hero vs. Younger Villain scenario.

-   The _Goosebumps_ book _How to Kill a Monster_ ends with the heroes captured by the monster, even after their attempts at killing it by making it fall through the stairs and poisoning it. Said monster is allergic to humans, and keels over dead after merely licking one. Unfortunately, the monster's friends are pissed off after this. Cue the horror, as the book ends with the heroes alone, far away from town, and in a marsh filled with these hungry, soon-to-awaken creatures. Hopefully the other monsters are allergic to humans too.

-   This is fairly common in _Redwall_:
    -   A purely villainous example occurs in _Mariel of Redwall_. Saltar the searat swears revenge on his leader Gabool because Gabool killed his brother. _"There was never any love lost between me and Bludrigg, but he was my brother, and blood must be repaid with blood."_

-   _Temeraire_: The dragon Lien travels from China to Europe to become The Dragon to Napoleon after her lifelong companion Yongxing, the Arc Villain of the second book, is disgraced and killed.

-   The sole motivation of evil vampire Victoria during the second and third books of the _Twilight_ series is to avenge the death of her boyfriend, James. Victoria believes that since Edward killed the person she most cared about (James), she should get even with Edward by killing the person he most cares about (Bella). Ironically, it isn't actually Edward who kills James in either the book or the film adaptation. It's some of the other members of the Cullen coven. And when the Cullen's ask the Denali coven for help, they refuse unless the Cullen's allow them to kill the werewolves, because the werewolves killed Irina's mate when he was about to kill Bella.
-   Liam Calhoun and his mother Mary Patricia Calhoun from _Vengeance In Death_ are willing to stop at nothing to avenge John Calhoun's death. What is rather creepy is how John Calhoun raped and torture-murdered an innocent young girl and these two want to _avenge_ him.

-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   Trakeena from _Power Rangers Lost Galaxy_ goes after the Power Rangers for killing her father.
    -   In _Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue_, after the Rangers destroy Diabolico, Lokai claims "Those rangers will pay for this dearly!"

    -   Thrax, of the 15th anniversary, wants to destroy the current Rangers because it was a group of Rangers who purified his parents (Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd) back in _Power Rangers in Space_, "killing" the people that they were as villains (since there's little to no resemblance now, physically or mentally).
-   _Revolution_: The episode "No Quarter" has Private Richards hell-bent on getting revenge for his dead best friend, Templeton.

    -   Villain-on-villain example: Meg makes it her life's mission to kill Crowley after Crowley helps the boys kill Lucifer. Funnily enough, she doesn't seem much interested in revenge on the Winchesters, possibly because Crowley's crime was treachery and the humans were simply trying to save their world. Ironically, Meg doesn't realize that Crowley saved her life, because Lucifer held demons in contempt and planned to kill them all when he had no more use for them, which Crowley was smart enough to realize without overhearing Lucifer's master plan.
-   _Tomica Hero Rescue Force_: Averted Trope, because when the Big Bad Daen does a Heel–Face Turn, and thinks that Redemption Equals Death, his "daughter" Maen (really a sentient computer program who resembles him) awakes.

It's actually the one who turned Daen evil in the first place, wanting to use him to eradicate humanity, because it calculated that humanity would be a threat to Earth.
-   A frequent occurrence in _Walker, Texas Ranger_, where the Villain of the Week is essentially avenging their friends and/or loved ones after they are either killed or imprisoned:

    Mythology & Religion 

-   Norse Mythology features the case of Skaði, daughter of the giant Þjassi (who got killed after kidnapping the goddess responsible for maintaining the gods' immortality and being a dick about what they'd have to do to get her back). The gods actually manage to pay her off (as noted under Real Life, this is all perfectly in line with moral Norse behaviour) with a marriage, and she ends up becoming the goddess of hunting, winter, and skiing (with an association with mountains as an environment). She's actually loyal to the gods after that, despite the marriage falling apart (she shacks up with Odin instead), which pays off when it means she gets the opportunity to torture the god that actually killed her father after said god (Loki) does a Face–Heel Turn.
-   In The Book of Mormon, a Nephite named Amalickiah leads a failed revolution to overthrow the democratic government and instate himself as king. By conspiracy and several murders, he later becomes king of the Lamanites and leads them in a long and bloody war that captures several Nephite cities.

He fails: the Nephites retake their cities with God's strength, and Ammoron is also assassinated.

-   Many Role Playing Games have rules that if your character has an enemy at character generation, there is a cost to lose the flaw and simply killing your enemy without paying the cost will result in someone taking his place in this manner.
-   In _GURPS Cabal_, the Cabal in question has a tradition of vengeance. Every member has two other members that he is assigned to avenge should they die, and every member has two other members who will avenge him upon his death. So if anyone kills one Cabalist, he will have two others avenging that one. Killing those two will being _four_ avengers, etc. (And since the Cabal is formed of mystics, sorcerers, monsters, etc., this can get scary real quick.)

    Video Games 

-   _Apex Legends_: Playable Legend Valkyrie is the daughter of Viper, an Apex Predator merc killed by Jack Cooper in _Titanfall 2_. Played with in that she tried to go after her father's former commander Blisk instead of Jack, but ended up being talked down after Blisk points out how she'd be left with nothing if she killed him. They ended up parting on peaceful terms after she took Blisk's invitation to join the Apex Games.
-   The _Borderlands 2_ DLC _Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt_, which canonically takes place after the end of the main game, has the main antagonist Professor Nakayama wishing to avenge the death of Handsome Jack, to whom he was fanatically devoted to the point of infatuation.
    -   The _Sir Hammerlock vs. The Son of Crawmerax_ DLC features Sparky Flynt the son of Captain Flynt, who wants revenge for his father's death. He's pulled together a group of other people with grudges against the Vault Hunters, most of whom also involve this trope (except for Sgt Jarter - his grudge against Axton is pretty understandable).
        
        **Sparky Flynt:** My dad was an asshole, but that doesn't mean you had to kill him! Now DIE!
        
        -   Later Averted with the _Borderlands 3_ character Zane Flynt - he's Captain Flynt's brother but perfectly willing to work alongside the Vault Hunters who killed him.
-   The Cyclops in _Castle Crashers_ attempts to avenge the groom of the kidnapped princess, until the player just frags him too. Twice.

This results in Frank once again battling a homicidal clown.
-   _Disco Elysium_: The Hanged Man, the victim of the murder you're investigating, is revealed to have been the leading officer of the Krenel mercenaries stationed in Martinaise. Aware of their colonel's rotting body hanging on a tree, the group began to organize a "tribunal" (read: a bloody and brutal reprise) against the people of the city over the death of their leader. You're tasked with finding the real killer to placate them before it's too late. However, the real killer can't be found until _after_ the tribunal (which acts as the climax of the game), and as a result there's no way to actually prevent it. All you can do is try to limit the damage they cause.
-   At the end of _Double Homework_, Dennis’s father vows to avenge his son’s death at the hands of Dr. Mosely/Zeta.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, you kill Arl Howe, a murderer, torturer, and anti-elf racist whom at least two of your origin stories have personal reasons to hate. In the expansion _Awakening_, his son Nathaniel sneaks into your castle to assassinate your Player Character. He decides to just take a few family heirlooms, only to get caught and thrown in a cell. You can then choose between killing him, conscripting him, or letting him go — in which case he comes back and asks to join your team of his own free will.
    -   Played for laughs in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_. After the player kills a minor villain named the Hand of Korth, his father, Chief Movran the Under, will be captured while throwing live goats at the player's castle. He admits to doing so purely out of custom, as he's as glad to see his "idiot son" dead as much as the rest of the clan is.
-   In _Dragon Ball Xenoverse_, part of the Big Bad Towa's motivation for tampering with the timeline to screw over the Z-Fighters is because she's the younger sister of the Demon King Dabura, who was killed by Majin Buu after Goku and Vegeta woke him up (ignoring the fact that Dabura himself was trying to wake up Buu).
-   In _Duel Savior Destiny_, Shezar is actually pretty pissed off in Mia's route when Mudou is killed before him, though they never really got along. None of his teammates seem to care and simply try to replace Mudou.
-   The plot of the _James Bond_ game _Everything or Nothing_ features Nikolai Diavlo carrying a personal vendetta against Bond for killing his mentor, Max Zorin.
-   In _E.V.O.: Search for Eden_, when you kill the male and female Yetis, this leaves their child (Junior) an orphan. Their child becomes a major opponent in the next level of the game, since he understandably wants revenge for your murdering his family (even though you had no choice).
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   Seen repeatedly in the latter half of _Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War_, where many good people fight your army only because you killed their parents earlier in the game.
    -   In the prologue chapters of _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_, Lyn gets the Ganglion after her due to killing Migal, one of their comrades, in self defense. In the main story, Eliwood and Hector face Linus or Lloyd of the Reed family.

This leads the surviving Reed brother to try to avenge his brother or die trying.
    -   The second chapter in _Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance_ has a bandit named Ikanau seeking revenge for the Greil mercenaries killing his friend earlier. Various bosses from the nation of Daein also mention wanting to avenge the deaths of their fellow soldiers to the heroes. A chapter set in Daein also downplays this by having the protagonists meet Daein civilians who angrily call out them out for killing their family members.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Awakening_ mostly uses 0% Approval Rating for all of its villains, but has an example in the optional chapters. Two villains are a pair of bandit twins. After the first twin dies, his sibling seeks revenge on his brother's killer. Whilst intended for comedy, the twins proved popular for this act of brotherly love in a story otherwise ruled by No Honor Among Thieves and won a popularity poll for best villain in the artbook.
-   In _Golden Sun: The Lost Age_, this is Karst's motivation for wanting to kill Isaac, who'd fought her older sister Menardi to the latter's death. This goes a long way toward making Karst one of the most sympathetic antagonists in the series. Also a subversion, as _The Lost Age_ also reveals that Menardi's goal, if not her methods, was heroic all along.
-   In _Heroes Rise_, Prodigal's goal is to become the greatest supervillain the city has ever seen as a homage to her mother, Miss Artillery, who was accidentally killed by your parents. Getting Revenge by Proxy on you is a bonus. However, at the end of the sequel, Prodigal shows up and offers an alliance with you against the Greater-Scope Villain President-Elect Victon, revealing that her mother may still be alive and the whole thing was set up to get your parents out of the way.
-   In _Kindergarten 2_, Jerome has developed a murderous vendetta against his classmate Lily for her involvement in his father the principal's death in the first game. However, in this case, he doesn't actually know that his father was a bad guy; he thinks that Lily is just paranoid and unstable. Fortunately, he manages to see reason when she points out that a man with nothing to hide wouldn't hand out bombs to his students set to go off if they say they know where their missing classmate Billy is, and the protagonist backs up her story.
-   _King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!_ has the Royal Family kidnapped by Mordak due to the fact that Alexander turned Mordak's brother into a cat in _King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human_ and Mordak wants to force Alex to turn him back.
-   _Mass Effect: Andromeda_:
    -   If Ryder allows the Collective to take over Kadara, Sloan Kelley's right-hand turian Kaetus promises to get revenge on them (having missed the coup due to a near-fatal beating).
    -   At the end of the "Firefighters" quest, if Ryder screws up and gets the well-meaning but dramatically misguided Knight killed, her son Alain takes this to mean that Ryder's been corrupted by SAM, and vows to fight them in her name, taking on the identity "Paladin".
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   In _Super Adventure Rockman_, Wood Man confronts Mega Man to avenge Shadow Man after the former completed destroyed Shadow Man to the point of no repair. His words upon being defeated are apologizing to Shadow Man for failing his vengeance.
    -   _Mega Man X_:
        -   In _Mega Man X3_, Gravity Beetle joins Doppler's army to avenge the death of his brother, Boomer Kuwanger.

    -   _Mega Man Battle Network_:
        -   Dr. Regal in _Mega Man Battle Network 4_ and _5_ is the son of Dr. Wily.
        -   In _Team Proto Man_, Mr. Gauss's daughter Tesla is eager to get back at Lan for defeating her father, but not because she particularly likes him — she's just mad about the _stress_ she's suffered, what with him being in jail and her having to take over as CEO of his company. She quickly forgets about it and even joins the protagonists.
        -   This is subverted in _Battle Network 6_ with the character of Ann Zap, the wife of Count Zap, whom Lan defeated way back in the first game. She doesn't know who Lan is when she meets him, but when she figures it out, she actually _thanks_ Lan for sending him to jail to pay for his crimes and get his life back together.
    -   _Mega Man Zero_:
        -   Kuwagust Anchus in _Mega Man Zero 2_ mentions his brother, Herculius Anchus, a boss from the first game, during his own boss fight. When the obligatory end-game Boss Rush comes along, Kuwagust is resurrected alongside Herculius for a Dual Boss.
        -   One of the eight Bosses in _Mega Man Zero 4_ is Tech Kraken. (For some reason, this seems to be a common theme with Krakens...) He's a pupil of the late Phantom of the Four Guardians, joining Dr. Weil's army to fight Zero for this reason. Interesting to note that neither Phantom nor Kraken are _actual_ villains. And once Zero defeats him for the second time, Kraken no longer holds a grudge, and even _encourages_ Zero to go on and defeat Dr. Weil!
-   _Mitsumete Knight_:
    -   This is how you'll get to fight one of the Eight Generals of Valpha-Valaharian, Rinanore of the Ice and Fire: she's in love with fellow general Borankio the Unshakable, and if you manage to kill him during the second war battle, one month later, she'll defect from Valpha-Valaharian just to challenge you to a duel to death and try to avenge his death.
    -   This is also how you'll get to fight another General, Salishuan the Spy: if you manage to kill leader of Valpha-Valaharian Wolfgario the Ravager in his unmasked version, that General, who happens to be his daughter Raizze Haimer (one of the winnable girls in the cast), will challenge you and try to avenge her father. In a very emotional variation of the trope, how much she's in love with you will determine if she'll survive this battle or not.
-   Parodied and deconstructed in _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_. Jasper's reason for killing Bishop is to avenge his father and brothers, who were nameless NPCs killed by Travis in an entirely optional mission.
-   Franziska Von Karma in _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Justice For All_, the daughter of Manfred Von Karma, whom in the previous game Phoenix defeated and sent to jail. She first appears making it clear that she has it out for Phoenix, while he tries to convince her that it's not such a big deal. It turns out to be a subversion; she _wasn't_ trying to avenge her father... she was trying to surpass her big-brother figure and childhood rival, Miles Edgeworth.
-   Subverted in _Robopon 2_. Dr. Zeke is the previously unseen brother of the Big Bad, Dr. Zero, from the first game. But rather than vowing to avenge his death, he goes back in time to save Zero so they can both destroy the hero.
-   Piastol from _Skies of Arcadia_; she thinks Vyse killed her father and sister and tries to kill him in return. The party luckily manages to explain the real events to her, but since her arc was added to the remake, she never joins you to go defeat the real killer, who is the final boss.
-   _Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time_: It's initially believed that this is Le Paradox's reason for going after the Cooper Clan across history, as his father was jailed for a crime that was actually committed by Sly's father<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Ultimately defied during the Final Boss, as Le Paradox admits that he _actually_ went after the Coopers simply to prove that he was a better thief than them.
-   _Star Wars: The Old Republic_: The Jedi Knight PC's first Arc Villain, Darth Angral, starts pursuing them across the galaxy after the Knight kills his son Lord Tarnis in the line of duty, with Angral watching over Video Phone — after goading Tarnis himself to kill the Knight.
-   The Big Bad of the John Woo game _Stranglehold_, Mr. James Wong, is the father of the original Big Bad from _Hard Boiled_, Johnny Wong. He's none too happy with Tequila on that score, even without his daughter falling in love with the Cowboy Cop.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   Bowser Jr. in _New Super Mario Bros._ and _Super Mario Sunshine_ wanted his "Mama Peach" brought back after Bowser told him Mario never fights fair and gives the idea to outsmart Mario.
    -   The Elder Princess Shroob in _Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time_. Somewhat notable in that she seemed to care about her sister, despite said sister not trying to reunite the Cobalt Star at all.
-   Subverted (or at least played with) in _Super Robot Wars 3_ and _Original Generation_ when Lune Zoldark, daughter of the Divine Crusaders' leader (whom you killed in the previous game/arc), attacks your group to avenge her father's death. The twist comes in that she knows exactly what the situation regarding her father was about, and after losing promptly drops the grudge and joins your side, having fulfilled her familial duty in engaging you.
-   _Ultima_:
    -   In _Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress_, the current Big Bad is a disciple and lover of the Big Bad from the first game.
    -   In _Ultima III: Exodus_, the titular Big Bad is a child of _both_ Big Bads from the previous two games.
-   In _Warframe_, killing planet boss enough times causes you to attract the attention of Stalker, who sends you a letter with the warning that blood will be avenged, and eventually shows up in one of your missions to take personal vengeance. It should be noted that Stalker himself has no affiliation with bosses whatsoever (especially when avenging Phorid or Lephantis), he just really, really hates the Tenno.
-   _World of Warcraft_:
    -   In the expansion _Cataclysm_, Vanessa Vancleef replaces her father Edwin Vancleef as the leader of the Defias Brotherhood, as well as the final boss of the Dead Mines. Revenge for her father's death is one of her primary goals.
    -   While Deathwing didn't need much of an excuse to ravage the world, the fact that his daughter's head hung from the gates of Stormwind did draw that city to his special attention.
-   Explicitly defied in the _Yakuza Kiwami_ remake of the first game, where after Shimano's death, his second-in-command Majima sends a message to Kiryu stating that while he knows that Kiryu and his allies had something to do with it, he won't be seeking vengeance because as far as he's concerned, Shimano fought his own battles.

    Webcomics

-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   Belkar kills a kobold in one early strip. His son turns up later to take revenge on Belkar. The trope is slightly twisted. While kobolds are a Usually Lawful Evil race, Belkar is himself rather unpleasant, and the kobold in question, Yokyok, appears to be _Lawful Good_, making him all the more fitting an Evil Counterpart (well, you know) for Chaotic Evil Belkar. (Word of God is that he was intended to be the odd man out his party alignment-wise, just as Belkar is in his own group.)
    -   An Ancient Black Dragon shows up to menace one of the protagonists, revealing herself to be the mother of a young black dragon the party killed many, many strips earlier. In the resolution of that threat, Vaarsuvius then takes rather extreme steps to prevent another such occurrence.
    -   In an unusual use of this trope, revenge is taken on _a villain_ for killing another villain. Nale kills Malack, then gloats to his dad and his "Aunt" Laurin about it, who were two of Malack's oldest friends. Tarquin seems willing to overlook the matter until Nale screams in his face that he wants _nothing_ from his father — whereupon Tarquin promptly plants a sword in his gut, both for Malack and their tempestuous past with each other. A furious Laurin then disintegrates Nale's remains and blows them away so that he cannot be resurrected. The situation is then ripe for this trope to happen _again_, as Nale's girlfriend Sabine is enraged and gives advice to Vaarsuvius on how to fight Tarquin and co.
-   _Slightly Damned_'s Lazuli swore revenge on the angel Kieri after she fought and wounded her in a battle and killed her comrade Talus.
-   In _Sluggy Freelance_ Zoe killed the demon K'Z'K several years ago. Now a cult that worships K'Z'K is keeping her under surveillance for unspecified, but undoubtedly very nasty, reasons.

    Western Animation 

-   In the _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ episode "Avatar Day", Aang is arrested and put on trial because in a past life (Avatar Kyoshi), he killed the village's founder, Emperor Chin. This is a partial subversion of the trope, as the villagers believe Chin to have been a benevolent ruler, but Kyoshi reveals that he was a horrible tyrant expanding his empire. Also, the aforementioned killing was less of a murder and more just not bothering to save the guy after the idiot fell off a cliff on his own.
-   _The Boondocks_: Subverted in "Stinkmeaner 3: The Hateocracy". A couple of Colonel H. Stinkmeaner's old associates target the Freeman family seemingly out of revenge for Robert's Accidental Murder of the blind old bastard way back in Season 1. However, while Stinkmeaner was an old "friend" of the Hateocracy, they don't personally care about him (nor each other). They're just using the thin excuse of "revenge" to try and murder the Freemans for the fun of it, and probably would have gone after some other random person anyway.

Dreadwing tries to kill Starscream over it despite being told to stand down by his master. Megatron is forced to kill him.
