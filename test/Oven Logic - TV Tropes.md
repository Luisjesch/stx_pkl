_"Relax, Candace. It's simple math. Instead of cooking it at 350 degrees for one hour, we could cook it for 5 minutes at..._ (enters equation into calculator) _9,000 degrees! What could go wrong?"_

Whenever someone is strapped for time and needs to cook something, they will assume that the time and temperature listed in the recipe are inversely proportional; logic a Straw Vulcan would be proud of.

For example, they'll assume a cake that needs 30 minutes at 200° Celsius (or 392° Fahrenheit) to bake can be baked just as well in 15 minutes at 400° Celsius (or 752° Fahrenheit), never mind that a normal kitchen oven won't go that high. Expect there to be flames, plenty of smoke, and for the Lethal Chef to pull out something resembling a forest fire from the oven. Or occasionally, a fireball that destroys the entire house, with a perfectly baked pie in the middle of the debris.

Various examples show the oven dial go up to thousands of degrees. One has to wonder why the oven had a dial that could go up that high if it wasn't meant to be used that way.

A subset of the horrible cooking skills of a Lethal Chef. This has probably been Truth in Television for some of us at one point in our lives. Also, notice that some processes _do_ behave according to Oven Logic; milk pasteurization, for example, can be done in 5 minutes at 70°C, or in less than 3 seconds at 150°C — though again, the reduction in time is disproportionate to the increase in temperature (and doing it faster changes the taste by caramelizing the milk sugar).

The biggest mistake most people make is believing that degrees is proportional to temperature, ie going from 100 to 200 degrees results in twice as much heat. This is not true because neither 0 degrees Celsius nor Fahrenheit indicates zero energy, or absolute zero. To find out how much you have to increase temperature by to actually get double thermal energy, you need to use Kelvin or Rankine.

That said, the rules in cooking (and chemistry) are still a bit more complicated than _heat x time_, which the character is not privy to — there are several factors to the equation that the "cook" in question fails to consider. The rate of heat transfer is not proportional to the temperature of the oven, but to the _difference_ between the temperatures of the oven and the food. Since the temperature of the food changes over time, you'd need to have a firm grasp of differential equations to be able to predict the time required at higher temperatures... or enough experience to cook "by feel", of course.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

That's not even counting the effect on chemical kinetics, which will greatly increase the rate of reactions such as oxidation (burning) at high temperatures. (The general rule of thumb is that every 10°C increase around room temperature roughly doubles the rate.) The chemistry of food can also be affected beyond simply being burnt beyond recognition. For example, many fruits and vegetables contain a fiber compound called "pectin" which helps give the food structure (it's what gives crisp fruits such as apples and vegetables such as cucumbers their "crunch" and what helps some sauces and spreads set and become solid.) Pectin begins to break down above about 185 degrees Fahrenheit (roughly 85 Celsius,) so most people interested in canning and preserving learn early on that if they try to heat their food much above that temperature, their "crispy" pickles become mush and their strawberry jam ends up as soup.

This trope is also a type of Logical Fallacy. May be a result of using algebra on cooking-related Applied Mathematics. Not (directly) related to Fridge Logic. The more extreme cases will require our chef to use Tim Taylor Technology. See also Mismeasurement. Contrast Instant Roast.

    Advertising 

-   In an ad for M&M's with a cookie recipe, the red and yellow M&Ms remind the consumer not to try this — the red one holding up burnt-looking cookies and mentioning "500 degrees for 20 minutes", while the yellow one, looking rather singed, says, "And _definitely_ don't try 1000 degrees for 10 minutes!"

    Anime & Manga 

-   Elias Ainsworth, from _The Ancient Magus' Bride_, was never taught how to properly cook, so it came as no surprise when a special chapter revealed he actually believed in this trope.
-   Baldroy from _Black Butler_ is a master of making anything he touches inedible. But it should be expected from a guy who cooks using flamethrowers and dynamite.
-   In Episode 29 of _Cardcaptor Sakura_, Meiling Li does this, hoping to have a cake done before Syaoran comes home from school (she wants to show him that she can make a cake for their school's Home-Ec class). Needless to say...
-   A variant appears in the episode "Toys in the Attic" of _Cowboy Bebop_, where Spike's impatience leads to him trying to use some kind of flamethrower-like tool to cook kebabs more quickly. The results are charred, inedible messes.
-   A version of this occurs in _Iron Wok Jan_. Jan is a skilled chef, but because he was raised alone by his grandfather, he has no idea how to cook for more than five people. When he starts working at the Gobancho restaurant, he tries to cook vegetables for fifty people by taking the recipes his grandfather taught him and multiplying all of the quantities of food by ten. The end result is deemed a failure. He realizes his mistake later: all of the additional vegetables add too much water and make the dish too juicy.
-   Millie in _Lost Universe_. You know that "exploding kitchen, perfect pie" analogy? The one used in the summary at the top of this page? She does this every time she cooks.
-   Satoshi in _Michiko & Hatchin_ applies Oven Logic to medication. He takes double the amount of pills recommended dose for adults, figuring it would double effectiveness.
-   Lethal Chef Akane Tendō in _Ranma ½_ has forgotten the boiled eggs, so she thinks she can have them up in "a jiffy" by popping the entire carton of eggs into the microwave. It explodes spectacularly.

    Comic Books 

-   _Freaks' Squeele_: Chance's solution to cooking two brands of pasta together is to average the cooking times. The result: a big heap of al dente pasta in mush. Not exactly disastrous, but it does put everyone off dinner. (Except Ombre.)
-   _Laff-A-Lympics_: Huckleberry Hound decides to turn the heat higher to cook faster. No numbers are mentioned.

    Comic Strips 

-   In one strip of _Beetle Bailey_, Cookie is watching a cooking show on television, sizing up the cake recipe for camp consumption along the way - that is, multiplying every ingredient by 100. At the end, however, the baking instructions arrive, and in the final panel, Cookie is seen sitting in front of an oven (with black smoke pouring out of it), declaring "It'll be ready next week."
-   _Calvin and Hobbes_ once decided that making twenty individual pancakes was too much work, so he just poured in all the batter, so as to make one big pancake and then cut it in half<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  It should also be noted that when he added the eggs, he didn't bother removing them from their shells.
-   An early episode of _For Better or for Worse_ applied this logic to clothes washing. If washing a load of clothes with a standard-sized scoop of detergent gets them clean for the next week, so the kids figured, washing them with the whole box of detergent should get them clean for the next few _months!_
-   One _FoxTrot_ strip played with this trope, with Jason complaining that the recipe didn't make it clear whether a "350-degree" oven was measured in Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin. Peter jokingly suggested that maybe they wanted him to rotate the oven just short of a full circle.

    Fan Works 

-   In this fan-made _Ace Attorney_ trial, this is inverted by April May, who decides to cook a chicken for 9 hours at 33.3 degrees celsius, instead of cooking for 90 minutes at 200 like instructed.
-   In the _Discworld_ of A.A. Pessimal, one of the few male students to take the Assassins' Guild School's Domestic Science course<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , is research-minded Assassin A.C. Clarke. Arthur is obsessed with what he calls the "macrowave oven" — a means of cooking complex time-heavy dishes in minutes, even seconds. Teacher Joan Sanderson-Reeves puts a very definite stop to _that_ line of thought but concedes it could have explosive uses. Joan then gets hapless student Hermann Meier Wetterarscht, who opted for Dom Sci as an undemanding three hours in the warm, in a class which was almost all girls. Wetterarscht, while trying for brioche and ciabatta, ends up recreating something akin to Dwarf Bread, causing an oven to collapse under the weight and then implode. Joan was not pleased.
-   _Family Guy Fanon_: "How Farg is Heaven?" has Randall Fargus showing off his newest invention he calls "Microwave-ception", where he microwaves a bag of popcorn inside of a small microwave and has that microwave inside of another microwave and that microwave is inside of another microwave, etc. until the thing is inside of five different microwaves. Mr. Fargus explains how this is going to help the microwaving process of popcorn go by all the more quicker. Mr. Fargus turns on the Microwave-ception and, unsurprisingly, this causes a nuclear explosion, which launches him across the room and slams him into a wall. While this is at first Played for Laughs as they laugh at Mr. Fargus' classic mishap, it's then Played for Drama when Mr. Fargus reveals he got colon cancer from the experiment and ends up dying from it.
    
    **Randall Fargus**: You see, microwaved popcorn generally takes about 5 minutes to pop but what if I were to put a simple bag of popcorn inside of five different microwaves at once!? Then I could pop through all that popcorn in just one minute! I mean, a delicious bag of popcorn being made in just a fifth of the time!? You can't go wrong!
    
-   _Kyon: Big Damn Hero_: Kuyou takes Mikuru's cooking advice about the importance of the proportions between ingredients at face value, a misconception that led her to think she can achieve good results if she simply works at a scale more comfortable for her perception and powers as long as the proportions are respected. Long story short, in Chapter 57 she tried to make a cookie six-point-five times as big as the _planet Jupiter_ in this manner. Apparently, at this scale the gravitational field generated by the cookie's own mass interferes with the baking process.
-   In this _My Hero Academia_ fan-comic, Todoroki tries to speed up baking cookies by going from 400 degrees for 10 minutes to 4,000 degrees for 1 minute. He then decides to bake them at 4 million degrees for 1 seconds with his quirk.
    
    **Postnote**: "In the end nobody got a cookie."
    
-   In _Princesses Can't Cook_, Luna decides that she should speed up the process of making ice cream (as the device for doing so _properly_ is not sized for alicorns) with a bit of magic. Lightning, to be specific. The resultant baked, and somehow _fried_, ice cream, winds up coating the kitchen, and the Sisters are forevermore banished (or, at least, put on probation), though the current chef does note that the disaster gives her an idea... one she'd like to explore further, from a great distance.
-   This tumblr fancomic shows why it's not a good idea to leave Zuko and Toph, two rich kids who have never cooked before in their lives, in charge of cooking.
    
    **Toph:** If we need to cook it at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, then it should only take a minute at 5250 degrees.  
    **Zuko:** I can do that.  
    ...  
    **Katara:** I said "WATCH THE FOOD FOR A MOMENT" How did this HAPPEN?  
    **Toph:** We've never stepped in a kitchen and have only one eye between us. So if you think about it...whatever happened here, and it's best if we don't get into specifics...is kinda your fault?
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Inverted in _The Accidental Tourist_: to keep the Thanksgiving turkey moist, the protagonist's sister cooks it overnight at only 140°F (60°C). Unlike the opposite, this can actually work (similar, if less extreme, methods have been endorsed by professional chefs, particularly those associated with the "molecular gastronomy" movement and others who emphasize a scientific approach to cooking), though it can interfere with some turkey-related traditions (like gravy for the side dishes).
-   In the 1997 theatrical movie of _Bean_, the two main characters attempt to pull off this trope when a pair of important guests drop by, both of them having completely forgotten about the appointment. Strapped for time and without having anything else to serve up, they decide to prepare a turkey dinner (which the non-Cloudcuckoolander of them notes would take about 5 hours to prepare) by _stuffing it into the microwave and trying to do the job in about 15 minutes_. The result is predictable.
-   _God of Cookery_ gets away with this because both participants in a cooking contest are using chi blasts to speed their cooking.

    Jokes 

-   Project Manager (n.): A person who thinks 9 women will produce a baby in 1 month.

    Literature 

-   In _Bridget Jones' Diary_, Bridget decides to make a caramelised oranges dish the night before, but needs to go to bed, so she reverses this idea, putting it on a lower temperature for a longer time. She ends up with something that looks like the picture in the book, if a bit darker. Her guests are prompted to ask "What is this Hon? Is it Marmalade?"
-   Employed by Katie in _The Girl with the Silver Eyes_ when she realizes that she's late putting the meat-loaf into the stove, so she moves the temperature from 350 to 500 to compensate and burns it. In her defense, she's 9.
-   In _Grimble_ by Clement Freud, a recipe tells Grimble to boil a potato for 20 minutes. He cuts it into sixteenths and boils them for a minute and a quarter.
-   Inverted in P. G. Wodehouse's _Love Among the Chickens_. Ukridge, in an attempt to save money, attempts to incubate chicken eggs at a lower temperature for a longer time. Predictably, it fails.
-   A tie-in _Red Dwarf_ 'official log' contained a recipe for a curry that is supposed to be left to stand overnight and slow-cooked for some hours before eating. Lister annotates it thus: "Smeg that! Life's too short. Bung it in the microwave for five minutes on Thermo-Nuclear; that's what it's _for_." Of course, given that he'd already upped the spice content by a couple of orders of magnitude it couldn't have made things much worse by that point.
-   In his popular math book _The Joy of X_, Steven Strogatz presents the following problem: A bath has two taps, one fast and one slow. The fast tap takes half-an-hour to fill the bath, and the slow tap takes one hour. If both taps are turned on at the same time, how long will it take to fill the bath? He notes that most people (including him, when he first heard it) immediately think "45 minutes". But that answer is wrong. In fact, if you think about it, it doesn't even make sense. If the fast tap just by itself can fill the bath in half-an-hour, turning the slow tap on at the same time obviously isn't going to make it take longer! There are a few ways to arrive at the correct solution. Here's one: express the rate of each tap in terms of "bathtubs per hour". The slow tap obviously fills 1 bathtub-per-hour, while the fast tap, being twice as fast, fills 2. So in one hour, they will together fill 3 bathtubs' worth. So to fill just 1 bathtub, they will take a third of an hour, which is 20 minutes.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Edge does this in the first season of _Blue Water High_, turning dinner into a charred mess. This helps establish Edge as someone who knows very little about life outside of surfing.
-   On _The Bob Newhart Show_, when the men are supposed to be cooking the Thanksgiving turkey, they wind up with an abbreviated and alcohol-fueled instance. After doing the math (250 degrees, 4 hours = 1000 degrees, 1 hour) a problem and creative solution are presented:
    
    This oven only goes to 500 degrees.  
    We'll get two ovens!
    
-   One episode of _Charles in Charge_ has a multi-tiered example; Charles and Buddy don't know what temperature to bake the cake at, so Buddy surmises that if a baked potato cooks at 350 degrees, a cake, which is approximately 10 times as big, should cook at 3,000. Since the oven only goes up to 500, they decide to compensate by cooking it for 6 times as long.
-   On an episode of _Family Matters_, Laura and Steve were partnered together in a home-ec class, and she tried to speed-bake a cake by doubling the heat.
-   Used in an unusual way on _Food Network Challenge_. When pouring sugar into a cold liquid to create designs, one contestant explained that the sugar (300 degrees in an unspecified scale) and the liquid nitrogen (-300 degrees in an unspecified scale) averaged out in temperature. Judging from context, the unspecified scale was Fahrenheit.
-   A Thanksgiving episode of _Good Luck Charlie_ has Amy turning the turkey fryer up to speed the cooking time. The ensuing explosion launches the turkey into the air and it falls on Teddy. The family ends up eating sandwiches that "may contain turkey" around her hospital bed.
-   Despite having to be good bakers just to get _on_ the show, bakers sometimes attempt this on _The Great British Bake Off_ because of time constraints: if they're behind, they may have no other choice if they're to have anything to present. Sometimes it works, sometimes it... doesn't.
-   The Man's Kitchen in one show of _Home Improvement_ had an over-the-top microwave (or as they called it, a "macrowave") that worked on this principle. It emits so much radiation that you cannot operate it without wearing _lead vests._
-   _Kate & Allie_ had an episode where Allie wasn't going to be around for dinner but prepared it in advance, leaving instructions to put it in the oven at a specified temperature for an hour. Not wanting to wait that long, Kate decided to double the temperature, thinking it would then only take half as long. Cut to the next scene where Kate is scraping the burnt dinner into the garbage, while her daughter, Emma, ate a slice of the pizza they wound up ordering.
-   A wonderful episode of _Kenan & Kel_ involved the pair trying to find a Thanksgiving turkey. They finally acquire one but with an hour to go to dinner, elect to place it in a microwave in the oven.
-   _Lois & Clark_ get a few house guests and they need to cook a turkey rather quickly. 300 degrees for a few hours equals a few seconds with Eye Beams. However, Clark was undergoing a Super-Power Meltdown at the time, causing the turkey to be burnt, and the kitchen to be wrecked.
-   The show _MANswers_, a show designed to answer "manly" questions, posed the question "What else \[besides an automobile\] could you put a HEMI engine into?" Their number 1 answer: a "HEMI grill", which could cook 240 hot dogs in 3 minutes. Whether or not this invokes Oven Logic depends on whether the engine is there to increase the grill temperature or speed up airflow.
-   Annie and Jake try this in the Thanksgiving episode of _Marry Me (2014)_. The turkey ends up burnt and they are forced to rely on Gil's selection of exotic cheeses.
-   The older brother on _Mr. Belvedere_ did this in one episode. The title character had quite a few witty one-liners regarding the results.
    
    "Kevin, I don't mean to be cruel, but this sounds like something your brother would do."  
    "Pity we don't have a kiln; we could have eaten yesterday."  
    "Instead of Lobster Thermidor we will be having lobster jerky."
    
-   _MythBusters_ tried examining various extreme ways to pop popcorn, one of the ways tested was explosions. which either fling the unpopped kernels around, burn them or both. They did, however, discover that you could pop popcorn with lasers, one kernel at a time.
    -   This trope was also explored when Adam and Jamie tested a viral video that involved firing shrimp from a cannon to have them collide with the batter and fly through cooking flames before landing on the plate. As Adam summates at the end of the episode, even the use of several swordsmith furnaces doesn't cook the shrimp, as you also need time in addition to heat, which the shrimp don't get when they pass through the furnaces in less than a second. This is why many other examples of this trope fail the way they do, as the way the heat is absorbed through the food is arguably _more_ important than the heat itself.
    -   Outside the world of cooking, when the words "Kinetic Energy" are spoken by a Mythbuster, there is a good chance of some oven logic coming up, where they trade mass for speed or vice versa, thinking that it's okay because the kinetic energy comes out the same, while ignoring that it throws other relevant values out of whack, such as Inertia, Momentum, Impulse, etc.  Getting hit by a multi-tonne freight train crawling along at a few inches per week is not the same as being hit by a supersonic bullet weighing just a few grams, despite identical kinetic energy. A sterling example of this came from the (multiple) tests and retests of the "Frozen Chicken" myth (i.e., testing aircraft windshields for birdstrike ratings by firing chickens out of an air cannon). Yes, a thawed chicken has the exact same kinetic energy as a frozen one. . . but the frozen one is _much harder_, and so has greater penetration. . . exactly what the myth was all about.
-   In an episode of _Nathan for You_, Nathan uses this logic to run a maid service, reasoning that if one maid takes four hours to clean a house, and two maids take two hours, then forty maids can clean a house in six minutes. It proves surprisingly effective.
-   On _Peep Show_, Jeremy explains how to "trick" the boiler into heating up the flat faster by setting it to a higher temperature than he actually wants, so it'll panic thinking it has a long way to go only to be shut off before it gets there.
-   This happened on an episode of _Pee-wee's Playhouse_. Pee-Wee and Ms. Yvonne were baking bread at 360 degrees, and Randy turned the oven up all the way to _700_, thinking that it would get done in half the time.
-   Parodied in the _The Red Green Show_, where a microwave is hooked up to a VCR to introduce fast forward (cook something rapidly), rewind (freeze something rapidly), and eject (launches the food product).
-   _Speechless_ also had this in a Thanksgiving episode, with predictable results.
-   Neelix does this in an episode of _Star Trek: Voyager_ and it works. Further proof that reality does not apply to this series. He also suggests at one point that if the crew picks up some space-gas he could use it to "get more energy" and improve cooking time. Many jokes have been made about Neelix's cooking both in and out of the show.
-   A later episode of _Three's Company_ had an episode where Jack was appearing on TV doing a cooking segment, with Janet and Terri as his assistants. During their rehearsal, Janet addresses the issue and Jack explained why it wasn't a good idea.
-   _The Uncle Floyd Show,_ an offbeat kids' show on the New Jersey Network, had Julia Stepchild creating some concoction in which the oven is preheated to "On."

    Puppet Shows 

-   A slightly different version of faulty cooking logic on an episode of _The Funday Pawpet Show_ as Herbie recounts realizing he had no eggs after having started mixing some brownie batter, so he just added more water since "Eggs are water, right?".

    Video Games 

-   In _Helltaker's_ apple pie recipe, Judgement tells the reader to bake the apple pie for a hour in 180°C, or blast it for ten seconds with advanced pyromancy. While her doing the latter didn't completely ruin the apple pie, it still left it burned, something she is embarrassed about.
-   Averted with the Papa Louie's cooking game series. An upgrade allows fast cooking food without reduction of quality.
-   In _Matchington Mansion_ Tiffany decides to double the oven temperature in an attempt to bake cookies in half the time, asking What Could Possibly Go Wrong?. When she tries feeding one to the dog and cat, they run out of the room.
-   Players who start playing MMORPGs for the first time sometimes make the mistake of thinking that say, 3 level 10 players are as powerful as a level 30 NPC. This is hardly ever the case, as the amount of power gained per level is rarely linear like that, and many games make it straight-up impossible to even hit/damage a target more than a certain number of levels higher, let alone actually kill one.

    Web Animation 

-   In the _AstroLOLogy_ short "Aries Whips Up a Disaster", Aries attends a baking class, but lacks the patience to make his dish properly. When the time comes to bake the class's bowls, Taurus sets them all to bake for 20 minutes, but Aries sets his bowl to the highest temperature for 30 seconds, causing it to catch fire and explode.

    Web Comics 

    Web Original 

-   In an Honorable Mention from _Darwin Awards_, a chef was cooking an alcohol-enriched fruitcake at 200 F in the oven, when his father dropped by the kitchen. Noticing the low temperature setting, and thinking to speed up the process, the father dialed the heat up to 350. Before the son could finish turning it down, or a verbal warning that "alcohol burns", the cake flamed out, blowing open the oven door and singing his forearm.
-   _SF Debris_ sums it up in his review of the _Voyager_ episode, "Flashback". "What kind of cook thinks that increased heat equals less cooking time? A bad one!"

    Western Animation 

-   _The Amazing World of Gumball_: In "The Knights", Gumball orders Darwin to bake cookies to prepare for Penny's visit to the Watterson house. When Darwin's just putting the tray in the oven, an impatient Gumball tells him to bake faster, then turns up the temperature and burns the cookies to a crisp.
-   _American Dad!_: Inverted when Steve hears about slow cooking, and goes in completely the opposite direction - he reasons that if a joint of pork cooked on a low heat for six hours renders it juicy and falling-off-the-bone, how much more succulent will it be if cooked on the lowest possible heat for a lot, lot, longer... Steve leaves it on a very low heat for several days. When it comes to serving it, it's falling off the bone because it has gone rotten and all four boys end up with serious food poisoning.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: "The Cave of Two Lovers": The Gaang and a group of hippies find themselves trapped in a tunnel labyrinth. It's been established that the torches they have will last two hours each. One of the hippie girls proceeds to light five of them thinking they're now good for 10 hours before Sokka has to put them out explaining the problem.

-   _Care Bears_: One episode has Mr. Beastly watching a cooking show, which at one point directed him to put a bowl of cookie dough in the freezer for 30 minutes — _"or the Deep Deep Freeze for 12 seconds!"_ We never know just how bad Mr. Beastly's oven math is, though, because apparently he fell asleep waiting 12 seconds. When he wakes up, the bowl is encased in a solid block of ice.
-   _Classic Disney Shorts_: In "Mickey's Birthday Party", Minnie's oven goes all the way up to "volcano heat." Goofy uses the setting to speed up baking the cake with explosive results.
-   _Dennis the Menace_: In "The Great Pie Swap", after Dennis, Gina, and Joey accidentally wreck a pie that Mrs. Wilson set out for Mr. Wilson, Dennis decides to cook a frozen pie to take its place. Gina reads the instructions on the box to Dennis, which say to cook the pie at 250 degress for half an hour. Dennis decides to cook the pie at 500 degrees so it will only take fifteen minutes. When the fifteen minutes are up, Dennis finds the pie burnt to a crisp. He then says "No wonder my mom told me to stay away from the stove!"
-   _Doug_: A recipe-based variation. Roger needs eight bananas for banana pudding but only has six, so he comes up with the brilliant idea of subtracting two from everything. The resulting goo isn't very appetizing on its own, but it turns out to be fantastic as a pizza topping. Note that this is _almost_ a valid cooking method, as he could have made a smaller recipe if he reduced each ingredient by 1/4 of its original amount, but subtracted when he should have multiplied. Close, but still so wrong.
-   _Ed, Edd n Eddy_ had Eddy do this with a microwaveable burrito, five seconds after he'd already delegated the task to The Smart Guy. No burrito merit badge for them.
-   In the _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_ episode in which Madame Foster's cookie recipe becomes a worldwide attraction "Cookie Dough", Bloo is left to make cookies all by himself after working all his friends to the bone. When he gets impatient with waiting for the cookies to bake, he uses this logic to bake a batch, causing the roof of the house to explode.
    
    **Bloo:** Okay, this is taking too long. Let's see, if it takes 20 minutes to cook at 250 degrees...it should take _2 minutes_ at 2500 degrees! _(Bloo does this, causing the roof to be blown off)_ Whoops.
    
-   The _Garfield's Thanksgiving_ special has Jon do this with the turkey — 350 degrees for five and a half hours becomes 500 degrees when he only has three hours: "Hmm. Guess I'll have to speed things up a bit. _(twist twist)_ 500 degrees! That was easy." What's interesting is that this will actually work, if it's done correctly, although it's a little more complicated than simply putting the turkey in the oven and cranking the heat up. It's known as "two-hour turkey," and the technique is detailed here. (It will not work with a turkey that's _still frozen_, as Jon's was.)
-   In the _Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi_ episode "Puffylicious", Kaz supposedly opens up a new restaurant called Puffylicious which both Ami and Yumi will run, but is later found out to have been a prank by Kaz for all the times the girls got him with pranks. Kaz comes dressed up and pretending to be a critic and the girls must find something to cook in order to get a good review for the "restaurant." The girls keep trying to cook different things from a recipe book and one recipe had a baking time of 18 minutes at 200 degrees but because they were strapped for time, Yumi suggests baking it for 2 minutes at 1800 degrees. She tries and the oven melts as a result.
    
    **Ami:** Bake it in the oven for 18 minutes at 200 degrees.  
    **Yumi:** Or we can bake it for 2 minutes at 1800 degrees.  
    _(This causes the oven to melt and the dish to be ruined)_
    
-   In the _Lalaloopsy_ episode "A Hobby For Bea", Bea and Crumbs are trying to bake a giant cookie and Bea gets the idea to double the temperature to reduce the baking time. This results in the cookie being burnt on the surface and too hard to eat.
-   _The Patrick Star Show_: In "Late for Breakfast", on Patrick's cooking show, he piles an assortment of trash into a pan and then cooks it at 1000 degrees for one second. It completely nukes everything in the pan, reducing it to gray dust.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_:
    -   Played for Laughs in "Moon Farm." While on the moon, Ferb relates a recipe for "Lamb Cobbler" to Phineas, who relates it to Irving, who relates it to Candace and Stacy. The ingredients get messed up in the typical "telephone" manner (e.g. "One pound of _lamp_" instead of "lamb,"), and the cooking time is 350 degrees for one hour. With only five minutes to spare, Stacy declares "It's simple math!" and proceeds to cook it at 9,000 degrees<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . It comes out perfectly, in defiance of any sort of logic.
    -   "Bad Hair Day" has Candace sitting under a hair restorer after a disastrous attempt at styling her own hair. She's supposed to sit under it for an hour at setting 5, but Jeremy says he's coming over in 20 minutes, so Candace decides that 10 seconds on setting 20 will do just as well. After all, "they wouldn't put a 20 on it if it weren't meant to be used, right?" This resulted in her hair being fixed, but over the course of her date, she grew enough facial and body hair to resemble an orangutan.

-   In an episode of _A Pup Named Scooby-Doo_ Shaggy makes popcorn by putting it in the microwave and setting the temperature to 8 million degrees for one second. It works: His house is instantly filled with popcorn.
    -   The same joke was also used in an episode of _The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo_, except this time he set the oven to "only" 5 million degrees and he ends up flooding the living room waist-deep in popcorn.
-   An episode of _The Simpsons_ which parodied _24_ has Marge trying to bake a cake in time for a bake sale. The recipe called for 20 minutes at 300F, which she equated to 5 minutes at 1200F. The resulting raisin sponge cake was hard enough to break through inexplicably bullet-proof glass.

-   In one episode of _Voltron Force_, Hunk builds an enormous contraption that turns out to be a jet fuel-powered grill to cook a side of ribs bigger than he is. It instantly burns the meat to ash, then blasts itself through the roof and explodes.
-   Discussed on _Young Justice:_ M'gann mentions an episode of her favorite sitcom where the main character tries to alter a recipe by making one giant cookie instead of a normal batch.

    Real Life 

-   In 2006, a man died in Australia after receiving at least 28 "jolts" from a taser, at 50,000 volts. Channel Nine News described this as "over a million volts altogether", but voltage doesn't work like that. Think of it this way: jumping from a height of 1 meter 100 times isn't as dangerous as jumping from a height of 100 meters once. 20x 50kV shocks is dangerous (especially if given in quick succession) but not for the same reason a single million volt shock would be.
-   Invoked by a math problem from a school: _If an orchestra of 120 players takes 40 minutes to play Beethoven's Ninth, how long would it take 60 players to play the same song?_. (The answer, just in case you're unsure, is still 40 minutes. Although some were quick to point out Beethoven's Ninth is supposed to take ~70 minutes to play through.)
-   Neil deGrasse Tyson was fond of saying that, according to his calculations, putting a pizza on a window sill on Venus would cook it in nine seconds. He was then corrected by a fan, who noted that he forgot to take into account certain things, and noted that the pizza would be cooked _instantly_. And then be vaporized. As would the window sill. And the building the window sill was attached to.
