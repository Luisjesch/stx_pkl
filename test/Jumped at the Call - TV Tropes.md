"...but you're a _baker_, Pinkie."

**Bruce Wayne:** I'm putting together a team. See, I believe enemies are coming...  
**Barry Allen:** Stop right there... I'm in!

For some heroes, when they receive the Call to Adventure, they refuse the call. When they finally accept the call, they continue to complain that "I Just Want to Be Normal".

Heroes who Jumped at the Call wonder what is wrong with those people. And vice versa.

These heroes are excited when adventure comes calling. They never, ever, _ever_ say "I Just Want to Be Normal". They already have a costume, already picked out a codename, and they have been practicing how to deliver a Pre-Asskicking One-Liner. They are already swallowing the red pill before you can even offer them the blue. About the worst thing you could do to them is to bring them down to normal or tell them someone else Missed the Call. They do not even care that more experienced people are reluctant; Least Is First.

Often, had a Changeling Fantasy once upon a time, and generally has otaku tendencies. They are truly living the dream. Such a hero is also the most likely to be The Unchosen One, the Chosen hero that chose themselves.

However, you can also be _too_ eager to jump, and end up jumping off _a cliff_. Beware shady strangers offering you everything you want. Savvy bad guys, especially the Big D, will try to get you to miss the real call by jumping at theirs instead. They also sometimes tend to forget the baggage that comes with answering the call, namely the fact that The Call Knows Where You Live.

When a hero is given a chance at returning to heroism and jumps at it, they are usually in love with being In Harm's Way. Neophytes might think themselves in love with it, and may actually turn out to be, but they may also discover, after real adventures, that they do not love it after all.

If a hero loses whatever power or abilities that made them a hero and forces themselves into The Call again, one could say they have Got the Call on Speed Dial. A variant path through The Hero's Journey.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Bakemonogatari_: Araragi's _charm_ is in Jumping At The Sight of an Oddity.
-   _Code Geass_: The Call to Adventure merely sped up Lelouch's schedule, at least the first time. The second time he receives The Call, the caller is a terrorist he _really_ should be running away from very fast, but his subconscious urge to jump trumps basic survival.
-   Yui Kasuga from _Corrector Yui_ was an Otaku obsessed with Magical Girls, and loved the idea of being one herself.
-   A crossover between _Crayon Shin-chan_ and _Kamen Rider Den-O_, Shin-chan throws himself at Ryotaro as he's slapping on his driver because he thinks transforming is cool, becoming "Shin-O".
-   Chiko from _The Daughter of Twenty Faces_ is so eager to go with Twenty that the only thing preventing her from getting out the door before **he** does is her episode 1 illness. Never has a "kidnapping victim" been so willing.
-   _Death Note_: Light Yagami: "I just killed two men... no wait... this is exactly what I've been thinking about lately. The world is rotting and those who are making it rot deserve to die!" Normal kid to murderous megalomaniac in less than a 5-minute sequence.
-   _Devil Hunter Yohko_: Asuza is a huge fangirl of Yohko and wants nothing more than to become just like her. So when she saw Chigako's ad in the paper, she assumed it was a want ad looking for an apprentice<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . That was all the opportunity she needed. Asuza showed up on Yohko's doorstep the next morning to sign up.
-   _Digimon_:
    -   Daisuke, Miyako, and Iori from _Digimon Adventure 02_, although the last two almost immediately regretted it and while they never quite made it to I Just Want to Be Normal, they never managed to be as gung-ho as Daisuke in the most critical moments.
    -   The _Digimon Frontier_ kids had to follow the directions of a literal call on their cellphones to make it to the Digital World, but Takuya was the one who actually jumped.
    -   Mikey in _Digimon Fusion_ drags his friends into the Digital World.
-   Kazuki from _Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure_ provides an excellent example of this. The second-in-command of Sanada's organization prepares a long, overwrought speech trying to convince him to fight in a mecha on behalf of their organization, and she is barely able to get five words out before Kazuki readily agrees.
-   Idiot Hero Daiya in _Gaiking: Legend of Daiku Maryu_ could not wait to get aboard the Daiku Maryu as Gaiking's pilot and head into the world of Darius, because it meant a quest to find his father.
-   In _Girls Beyond the Wasteland_, Teruha immediately volunteers to program the game for them after hearing about it. Since she doesn't know anyone else, Sayuki agrees to it.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_ fits this trope _so much_ that instead of waiting for the Call, she actually goes out _looking_ for it (never realizing that it could be behind her back the whole time).
-   Antihero example: Alucard of _Hellsing_ isn't really a hero, but he's willing to do heroic deeds just for the action. _Very_ willing. Enough that one of his catchphrases is _demanding_ he be given an order by his master.
-   _Inazuma Eleven_: In the first episode, when Endou was looking for more members for the soccer club, some of the characters, like Max and Kageno, willingly joined the club.
-   Kenji in _Koutetsushin Jeeg_ - much to the surprise of the base staff, who had a big "I know this isn't going to be easy for you" speech lined up. Kenji, while Hot-Blooded, isn't the brightest star in the sky.
-   Takamachi Nanoha from _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_. At the age of nine, she was already Desperately Looking for a Purpose in Life, though she certainly was not thinking "magical girl". Though she has a hesitant beginning, she soon becomes extremely enthusiastic about her new "destiny". Let's be honest here, the girl loves to fight as a magical girl.
-   The main protagonist from _MÄR_ does not seem to be bothered one bit that he was sucked into a magical world of adventure without his consent. Indeed, he rather enjoys the new life he finds there. When a shopkeeper informs him that the particular ARM he's looking for (Monpierre Blanc, which can send him back home) isn't in her selection and would probably be far too rare and expensive to just buy somewhere, he's relieved; he'd been worried his adventure would end too soon.
-   Gai Daigouji from _Martian Successor Nadesico_ (real name: Jiro Yamada, but he didn't think that sounded heroic enough) is so eager to be a giant robot pilot that he arrives at his post three days ahead of schedule. He promptly breaks his leg from showing off.
-   In the _Mazinger_ series:
    -   _Mazinger Z_: Kouji Kabuto. His grandfather died after explaining to him that Dr. Hell, an ex-colleague of his, was a Mad Scientist who wanted to Take Over the World and had tried to kill him because he had built a Humongous Mecha to stop him. After this, Kouji was just eager to pilot Mazinger-Z and avenge his grandfather's murder. In _Shin Mazinger Zero_ we saw what could have happened if he had Refused the Call. It was... _not pretty_.
    -   _Great Mazinger_: Tetsuya Tsurugi has been a Humongous Mecha pilot most of his life. He devotes himself to his job, loathes the idea of being just normal, and is perfectly fine with having to kill giant monsters. However, he used to be a lonely, little orphan kid who yearned for a father. When Prof. Kabuto told him he would adopt him if he was willing to train to pilot a Humongous Mecha and defeat ancient bio-mechanical monsters from Beneath the Earth, Tetsuya agreed _gleefully_. Nevertheless, his obsessiveness combined with his abandonment issues, lack of self-confidence and self-worth, and a massively low opinion of himself (that he tried to hide behind a mask of arrogance and pride) led to many troubles and finally a _massive_ breakdown. His partner Jun also jumped at the call, but she managed to get it more together than him.
    -   _UFO Robo Grendizer_: Duke Fleed subverts it slightly. He was a reluctant hero who hated fighting and just wanted to be normal. When the Vegans attacked he could have just laid low and nobody would have forced him into battle. He willingly decided to fight, nonetheless (knowing that the consequences of not acting involve your new home becoming an uninhabitable radioactive wasteland and all of the people you care for being killed or enslaved no doubt factored into his decision).
-   _Made in Abyss_: Riko has seemingly been obsessed with cave-diving since she learned to walk. In the first episode, she tries (again) to convince her teacher to let her go deeper, right after she and Nat have a near-fatal encounter with a monster that wandered up from the depths. When a mysterious letter from her mother reaches the surface, inviting Riko to come find her at the bottom of the chasm, Riko essentially takes it as an excuse to do what she always intended to do anyway.
-   In _Magic Knight Rayearth_, Hikaru is instantly eager and willing to take up Clef's charge of saving Princess Emeraude while Umi and Fuu are still protesting that they need to get back to Tokyo. Throughout the journey, she's the one who takes the lead and keeps them going. As a consequence, The Reveal of their _true_ mission is so painful to her that the second season of the anime gives her an Enemy Without created from her sorrow.
-   Genki from _Monster Rancher_ may not have been expecting to be sucked into the game world but he sure didn't have any issue being there.
-   In _My Hero Academia_, protagonist Izuku Midoriya leaps at the chance to become a hero when All Might offers to pass down his Quirk to him. After being told his whole life that his dream was impossible, including by All Might himself earlier that same day, he had no reason to refuse.
    
    **Izuku**: _\[wiping away tears with his sleeve\]_ He'd told me so much... he told his greatest secrets to me! Do I have a reason to not accept?! No...! Not at all!
    
-   Midori in _My-HiME_ is not only enthusiastic about her powers, but also seems to think she's _Sailor Moon_, complete with the "V" gesture, over-the-top introductions, and inspirational speeches about justice and friendship. Doubly ironic because not only is the series notably devoid of all that (and is significantly darker), but also because the original just wanted to be normal.
-   After seeing Shizuru effortlessly demolish a fleet of battleships in the first episode of _My-Otome_, Arika made the decision on the spot to start her path toward becoming a full-fledged Otome just like Shizuru, as part of her journey to find her long-missing mother. It doesn't help matters much that she receives encouragement from Haruka Armitage shortly thereafter.
-   Naruto Uzumaki of _Naruto_. Pre-Timeskip, he always jumps at the call to prove himself. Post? When the Fourth Shinobi World War had started and he didn't know, but when he learned he broke out of his confinement with Killer Bee, faced the Raikage to prove he was up to the challenge, and finally reached the battlefield to protect his friends.
-   Several characters in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, unsurprisingly. Haruna stands out, as when the Masquerade is broken for her, she _threatens to torture her three best friends_ for not letting her in on it sooner.
    -   It took her half a picosecond to immediately snog Negi when she learned this would give her magic powers. When this failed to work the first time (Chamo didn't have the contracting spell ready), the only reason it took her a little longer to snog him _again_ was because poor Negi was _running scared_ by then and she had to catch him first.
-   Asuka from _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ has been a Mecha pilot most of her life and revels in it. In fact, facing alien invaders is about the only thing she doesn't complain about. Finding herself paired up with a reluctant hero who is all "I Just Want to Be Normal" (Shinji) leads to a certain amount of tension. Add in an Emotionless Girl, and the whole gig starts to lose its luster. When it starts to become clear that she isn't The Chosen One and is likely to end up a Sidekick at best, she starts down the Hourglass Plot path, ending up in Mind Rape and Convenient Coma.
-   _No Game No Life_ plays this both ways. First, when NEET siblings Sora and Shiro are asked if they feel they weren't meant to live the life they lived in the world they lived in, they didn't hesitate to say "yes". When they were then flung headfirst into a bizarre world governed by games, they initially reacted with a shocked fear, but this was soon replaced by pure enthusiasm, even wondering why so many heroes in their situation become so obsessed with getting back to their nobody lives in their old world.
    -   Their shocked fear might have been more because they were flung into this world at skydiving heights, and told the rules of the world by the god governing it. The first rule of "no one can be murdered" punctuates their softer than expected terminal velocity landing, made funnier by the last rule of "let's all have fun".
-   _Ojamajo Doremi_ gives us the main character, who accidentally discovers a witch's true identity and gets her transformed into a green... blob or something. When said witch says Doremi must compensate via becoming her apprentice...
-   Monkey D. Luffy from _One Piece_. He didn't need (or really have) any particular reason to become a pirate other than that he thought pirates were cool. He functions as a walking call when it comes to recruiting members of his crew.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   While it would be considered normal within the context of the involved world, Ash Ketchum jumps at any chance to test his skills as a Pokémon Trainer, visiting whatever lands on his quest to become the Pokémon Master.
    -   There are several Pokémon that count for this as well. In _Pokémon the Series: XY_, Froakie caught himself for Ash.
    -   Misty's Psyduck frequently jumps out of its Pokéball when Misty is trying to summon a different Pokémon. The only time this worked in Misty's favor was in _The Ninja Poké-showdown_ where Psyduck used its headache to defeat Team Rocket with its powerful Psychic attacks. Misty hoped this would happen again in _The Bridge Bike Gang_, but it didn't have a headache as strong as the previous episode.
-   _Pretty Cure_:
    -   In _Yes! Pretty Cure 5_, Nozomi Jumped at the Call before she even knew there _was_ one, and in fact, this is what brings the Call to Adventure _to_ her.
    -   Megumi of _HappinessCharge Pretty Cure!_, being a fangirl of the Pretty Cure, was more than willing to become Hime's partner... after she beaned the girl with the item to find her partner.
-   _Rune Soldier Louie_: It didn't take much to convince Louie to join Jeanie's group, since he'd much rather go off on adventures than be stuck at the Magician's Guild studying magic. So he gladly accepted the offer.
-   Deconstructed in _Sakugan_. Even before receiving the call, Memempu was making almost nightly attempts to get to the hanger where the city's Mecha are stored, with her Fantasy-Forbidding Father barely keeping her from succeeding. Near the end of the first episode, the pair witnesses two of their best friends - professional pilots to those mechs - die ignobly while trying to defend their home. In the aftermath, Memempu realizes, to her own horror, that she still wants to answer the call despite this, prompting her to ask her father if there's something seriously wrong with her.
-   Yuji Sakai from _Shakugan no Shana_, once he learns that he's just a Torch and will disappear one of these days, figures that he'd rather do something else than just waiting until he disappears, and does what he can to aid the titular Action Girlfriend, Shana.
-   Otoha Sakurano from _Sky Girls_ had dreamt of flying in the sky ever since she was a child so when the military came to her home looking for her to be a pilot, she naturally said she wanted to do it.
-   _Slayers_:
    -   Princess Amelia, despite being a magical princess in a fantasy setting, draws up long speeches about Justice, names attacks — like punching someone really hard — and generally tries to be a superhero. She also always has the high ground (even if she tends to fall off of it). This is largely because she's a parody of _Sailor Moon_.
    -   Prince Phil (Amelia's dad) keeps the family trait, going so far as to fake his death and start running around the rooftops in a _frikkin' Batman costume_. Despite being the bloomin' _King_!!
-   Hunter Steele in _Spider Riders_ definitely fits this trope. Heck, he had to go out of his way to prove he was a rider. Not to mention swallowing his pride and actually asking for help from Shadow.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: **The Mighty Kamina!** When a giant mech, technology that was completely unknown to them, drops into their underground village, he stands up to it and threatens it with a completely ordinary nodachi which he took from the Village Chief, heroic speech at hand <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Even after the girl with the absurdly powerful rifle, also unknown technology to the village, barely damages it. Then again, _Katanas Are Just Better_. This is just the start - his entire job in the series seems to be heroic speeches and epic-but-ridiculous action, down to called attacks like the "WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM?! KICK!".
-   Once he learned there was a call to be answered, Kotetsu T. Kaburagi from _Tiger & Bunny_ charged in its direction and never looked back. Back in high school, he spent most of his time trying to come up with cool superhero names and beating up street gangs as a "vanguard of justice".
    -   Like father, like daughter. Kotetsu's child Kaede recently got her own NEXT powers, and now that Kotetsu has been framed by Maverick to take him out, she has decided to help her father to clear his name. And mind you, Kaede is _ten_.
-   Though Minto Aizawa in _Tokyo Mew Mew_ wasn't happy about working with Ichigo at first, she thought it was her destiny to become Mew Mint and was even secretly delighted, which fits well with her reaction to her object of affection's Refusal of the Call.
    -   The anime reboot takes it a step further by having Minto become a Mew Mew before Ichigo and is happy to be one of The Chosen Many.
-   _Transformers: Super-God Masterforce_: The kids approach Metalhawk and _ask_ him for The Call.
-   Subverted in _The Twelve Kingdoms_: the Genre Savvy Yuka Sugimoto is thrilled at the prospect of being the heroine of a Trapped in Another World adventure story when a mysterious blond Bishōnen and a flying monster or two show up at her high school... except she isn't and they weren't there for _her_. The _real_ heroine of the story, her classmate Youko Nakajima, has a typical (and one might say extreme) Refusal of the Call reaction to the early events of the series. Unfortunately, Yuka's stubborn insistence that _she_ was the one being called causes her to act as an antagonist for a significant chunk of the first Story Arc. To her merit, once she _does_ realize how mistaken she was, Yuka concedes and goes back home, letting Yoko take over.
-   In _Wa ga Na wa Umishi_, although Rintarou initially refuses the call to be a salvor, once he makes his decision, he tends to jump at any and every call to salvage something, even when his older and wiser advisors try to tell him it's a bad idea. This has happened at least 4 times in 8 volumes alone.

    Comic Books 

-   Angela Spica of _The Authority_ decided as a child that she was going to be a superhero when she grew up. As soon as she designed the technology, she exchanged her blood for nine pints of liquid nanotech, called herself The Engineer, and got right on saving the world (and overthrowing a few sovereign nations that pissed her off). Unique among her teammates, she both chose to be a superhero AND didn't regret the choice the minute the consequences kicked in. Catchphrase: "This is the best job in the world."
-   _Batman_: Tim Drake jumped at the call even when Batman said "no". He knew that Batman needed a Robin and if Dick Grayson wouldn't be Robin again, then _he_ would. He's an interesting take as he first tried to get Dick to take the role and then figured his own status as a costumed hero would be temporary but given everything Bruce had better be well pleased Tim forced the Bat-family to accept him.
-   _Birds of Prey_: Misfit is a rather tragic take on this. She Jumped at the Call because she doesn't have a normal life to return to after her family died in an apartment fire. She was unable to save them because her teleportation powers kill anything that travels with her, and may or may not have been their cause of death by trying anyways (not that staying in the fire was any better).
-   The third Black Knight, Dane Whitman, starts off this way. Originally just an ordinary physicist, he had a habit of jumping at _everything_. Follow his dying supervillain uncle's request to redeem the Black Knight legacy? All right! Take up the family sword? Sure! Stay to fight in the Crusades after accidentally taking over his ancestor's body? Why not! Join every superhero team that's asked him to? Right on! He even jumps headlong into romantic relationships. But, in _Captain Britain and MI13_, after he's discovered the Crusades sucked, his family sword is hideously cursed yet he can't get rid of it, every single team he's joined and woman he's dated has forgotten him, and he feels like the only one still trying for idealistically heroic ideals, he's wondering if all that jumping was a good idea.
-   _Captain America_: Steve Rogers wanted to be a soldier before Pearl Harbor, but was rejected for poor physical health. Didn't stop him from trying to put on weight and heading to a recruitment station, time and time again. Eventually, a General took him aside and told him 'What if we shot you up with drugs and stuck you in the path of radioactive materials?'
-   _The DCU_ superhero Eddie Bloomberg wanted to be a superhero so badly that he built his own power suit at the age of 12 and dubbed himself Kid Devil, Blue Devil's sidekick.
-   Empowered, full stop. You can see how much she wanted to become a superheroine if you consider that she gets her powers from a Stripperiffic super suit which loses powers immediately when ripped (which happens constantly) and still doesn't give up.
-   _Green Lantern_:
    -   Guy Gardner. Not only does he revel in being a Green Lantern, but whenever his powers get taken away, he goes out and finds _entirely new powers_. He even spent a brief period as a Bad Ass Normal before Executive Meddling gave him tattoos and morphing powers.
    -   Kyle Rayner. A "blue midget in a dress" gives him a ring and he's not sure what is going on but thinks it is way cool that when he puts on the ring his clothes change. Then his girlfriend points out that is Green Lantern's costume and Kyle gets even more enthusiastic.
-   Faith of _Harbinger_ was a cheerful comic geek who was overjoyed when she was offered the chance to get superpowers. As in the _Runaways_ example above, she's the only one of her teammates to put together a homemade costume, as well as the only one to really think of herself as a 'superhero'.
-   _Justice Riders_: Booster Gold offers to join Diana's posse the moment he hears her discuss her mission. When she turns him down after Kid Flash outdraws him, he sets out to buy a Gatling gun that will make the heroes reconsider turning him away.
-   Every single member of the Golden Age/Earth-Two Justice Society of America was a hero who had leapt at the opportunity to become one, often having to fight societal expectations or others against their doing so.
-   _The Mighty_: When Gabriel Cole got the opportunity to help his hero, Alpha One, out. He accepted the promotion to Section Omega Captain.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (IDW)_: During the "Nightmare Knights" storyline, Trixie agrees to join the titular group before she's even told what they're going to do (or the dangers that are involved), simply because everypony else gets to have exciting adventures and she feels left out. (Note that when she got dragged into adventure in the main animated continuity, she was... less enthusiastic.)
-   Joshua Carver of _No Hero_ not only jumped at the call but he chased after it aggressively.
-   Jakita Wagner in Warren Ellis' comic-book series _Planetary_ is an example of this, but not out of a sense of heroism. At one point in the series, she gets to destroy several thirty-foot mutant ants with her bare hands. Though she doesn't say anything, the expression on her face in the close-ups clearly reads "I have the best job in the world."
    
    **Elijah**: Why'd you join? The money or the secrecy your Fourth Man can buy?  
    **Jakita**: Neither. I get bored easily. Planetary stops me getting bored.
    
    -   In a nice cross-trope subversion in one issue, she's all happy and feeling good after saving the Red Shirt helicopter pilot from exploding.
-   In _Runaways_, Molly Hayes is very enthusiastic about superheroing. She's reduced to awkward Shy Finger-Twiddling when she realizes no one else came up with a costume.
-   Amy Rose in _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_. Going so far as to snatch up a powerful ring and using it to initiate an age-up. Despite that, it takes Amy quite awhile to officially be made a Freedom Fighter, but when she is, she takes it with pride.
-   Squirrel Girl. Her entire existence revolves around this trope. When she met Iron Man in her first appearance, she was a fourteen-year-old girl who had already created her own costume, her own power set, and her own code name, and she desperately tried to become Iron Man's sidekick. After moving to New York she protected Central Park from muggers. After GLA, er GLX-, now GLC, yes GLI asked her to join their team she quickly agreed, not even bothering to consider asking her parents. What a trooper!
-   _Teen Titans_: Beast Boy is a green freak who can shape-shift, and wouldn't have it any other way. Being able to date Raven was probably a plus too. Before he was in the Titans, he was with Doom Patrol, a group entirely based around Blessed with Suck. Most of the Patrollers were adults who had lives and careers they lost when they changed. Gar was changed into a metahuman before preschool and thinks being a shapeshifter is great fun. He's been heroing since _before_ his teens and it's all he knows. The Wolfman-Perez era was _very_ quick to point out he's got some Patrol-level issues under the goofball mask.
-   _The Warlord (DC)_: The Russian Adventurer Archaeologist needed no persuading when she was offered the opportunity to accompany Morgan to the Lost World of Skartaris, even though it meant she might never be able to return to Earth.
-   _Wonder Girl_: Cassie Sandsmark went to great lengths to become a superhero, starting at stealing enchanted artifacts to empower herself, and eventually marching right up to the king of the gods and asking him for powers.
-   _Young Avengers_: The titular young Avengers are often described as super-powered fanboys, especially Billy (Wiccan) and Teddy (Hulkling). The first five members of the team had pretty strong ties to the original Avengers that fueled their desire to become superheroes, and although Kate (the fifth member) had no such ties, she was pretty set on becoming a hero as well.

    Fan Works 

-   Discussed in _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_ by Mark Russell in regards to Madison — in a display of Adaptational Intelligence, Mark admits that with the way Madison's been raised unconventionally in Monarch for years before the events of _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_, he suspects that she probably doesn't even _want_ a normal childhood anymore if she can even have one.
-   Subverted in _Amazing Fantasy_. Izuku _wants_ to do this when Peter Parker offers to teach him how to use his new powers to become Spider-Man. But Izuku ends up asking for more time to think because of his poor self-esteem and worry about whether or not Peter would be able to get home. Then it's played completely straight after All Might's pep talk inspires Izuku to accept, showing clear excitement at learning to become Spider-Man and getting to chase his dream of helping people as a Hero.
-   Anla'Shok's _Checkmate Anlashok_:
    -   Lyme (a long-standing rebel here) has a tribute who did this, a Sociopathic Hero named Wolfe.
        
        Lyme had just had to tell him, show him that he was unique, and he had given her his loyalty. She'd stood by him after the arena, as he woke up a cripple, his pride shattered day after day as he learned to walk gracefully again, to speak with a hoarse voice he couldn't recognize and hated. By the 68th, barely twenty, Wolfe had been obsessed with leveling the power field.
        
    -   Her other Victor, Bahamut, is slower to join the Rebellion but shows willingness and almost relief when Lyme makes it sound like an order. _His_ victor, Enobaria is also quick to join Lyme after surviving the Quell, saving Lyme from being turned in by a victor who refused her offer and admitting that "I want Snow gone. I want to be free. I want to be allowed to be proud to have been born here when it's over."
    -   District 8's youngest Victor Moire also has shades of this, in addition to The Atoner after being too scared to volunteer for Cecelia, joining the rebel army and putting herself in the line of fire.
-   _Children of an Elder God_: Downplayed with Shinji in chapter 1. When his father asked him piloting Unit 01 he was not particularly enthusiastic about it, but he agreed to do it because he thought NERV had no one else and he did not want his father to think he was a coward.
-   Eidolon and Shift from _DC Nation_ are raging, hard-core superhero fanboys who jumped at the chance to become heroes in their own right. Green Lantern Travis Grey pickpocketed his ring, used it to clean up his crappy, inner-city neighborhood. When the senior lanterns come back for the ring, he just dares them to take it. Guy is so impressed by this, he offers to train the kid.
-   In _Erika Change_, a _Girls und Panzer_ doujin in which Erika transfers to Oarai in Miho's stead, Erika is so eager to get involved with tankery that she chooses it as her elective before it's officially offered. Unfortunately for her, she ends up having a Heroic BSoD when she learns that Oarai will be going up against her former school, Kuromorimine (since Erika deeply admires Maho, the commander and Miho's older sister).
-   _Eugenesis_ has Emyrissus, who was assigned the all-but-outright impossible mission to assassinate Galvatron, and gladly accepted without hesitation. When we first meet him, he's been sitting in the same place for three years, still waiting for a chance to finish his mission, and his enthusiasm hasn't waned in the slightest.
-   Despite being a Knight in Sour Armor, Lulu has a habit of this in _Guardian_. She begs to become Lady Ginnem's guardian and doesn't hesitate to ask Zuke if she can do the same later in hopes of sparing Yuna. It goes to explain why she instantly volunteers to be Yuna's Final Aeon, the scene that opens the comic.
-   _Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_ has Harry jump pretty quick and far: breaking into Azkaban, fighting aurors, and breaking out Bellatrix Black because Quirrell convinced him it was a heroic quest. Deconstructed when he realizes that it is a rather serious flaw of his.
    
    **Sorting Hat**: You're just guessing, or to put it more exactly, wishing that you have some ready-made heroic role that is your personal property.
    
-   In the _Shazam!_ story _Here There Be Monsters_, Captain Midnight firmly refuses to join the Squadron of Justice when asked, but his wife Joyce and his apprentice Chuck are eager to don a pair of makeshift costumes and head for the Squadron's rendezvous point.
-   Nonoko in _Kyon: Big Damn Hero_ is a little too eager to become a Magical Girl. So when she's left with her brother's supernatural weapons and protective gear when the school he attends is attacked, she is eager to go — not to return her brother's stuff to him, but to rescue him.
-   _Little Hands, Big Attitude_: Combined with Screw the Rules, I'm Doing What's Right!; Sonic decides to save Shadow from GUN by feeling his in secret even after his parents and Agent Tower specifically forbid him from doing so because they would get in extra trouble with the already xenophobic GUN. When Agent Tower finds Sonic again, he calls him out on his Leeroy Jenkins and Didn't Think This Through tendecies by pointing out that all the times Sonic "saved the day", he had to be rescued by someone else or put him family in danger (such as when his mom broke him out of prison or how his parents were one second from getting stomped to death by Eggman's robot if not for dumb luck). Sonic doesn't appear to get the message.
-   In the _Prehistoric Park_ fanfic (and partial Continuity Reboot for _Prehistoric Earth_) _Prehistoric Park Reimagined_, _every_ staff member at the titular park eagerly accepted the opportunity to work there when offered as much.
-   _Serendipitous Fate_ has a villainous example from Lila, who accepts Hawkmoth's offer to get revenge on Ladybug with much more enthusiasm than Chloe.
-   Unsurprisingly for a fanfic for _The Hunger Games_, the Career tributes in _Some Semblance of Meaning_. (Obsidian apparently volunteered to keep his little cousin from having to go into the Games before he was ready, although he undoubtedly would have done so, anyway.)
-   _The Victors Project_: Cashmere is not an active member of the Rebellion. But as soon as she hears about their plan to save Katniss and Peeta, and bring down the system that ruined her life, she arranges a meeting with Beetee, and practically _begs_ him to let her do something, anything, to help, even if it means getting herself killed in the process.
-   In Lorata's _We Must Be Killers_, series Claudius is the only District 2 victor to truly want and expect a Rebellion even before the 3rd Quarter Quell is announced, but remains where he is out of Undying Loyalty to his mentor Lyme. Eight years before the Quell, he gives her an All Take No Give speech about the Capitol and asks her to take him with her once she's finally had enough. Once that moment finally comes, all Lyme has to do is walk into his bedroom, toss him a bag, and ask if he's coming to get his assent.
    
    **Claudius:** I thought you'd never ask.
    
-   In _The Web of The Spider-Man_, Peter is immediately inspired to become a superhero after a talk with his best friend and fellow nerd, Ned. They're drafting a superhero costume and gadgets within days of Peter discovering his new spider powers.
-   In _What if the Yeerks Were the Good Guys?_, Tom is ecstatic to discover that aliens are real, and doesn't hesitate to save the Sharing from some hungry Taxxons immediately afterwards.
-   Sort of, in _With Strings Attached_. In the Prologue, Varx offers Paul the chance to go on “a great adventure.” Paul, thinking he's dreaming, readily accepts. Except Varx then reveals he's not dreaming, so he suddenly has second thoughts—but whoops, too late.
-   In _The Echo Ranger_, Melissa Shield didn't just jump at The Call. She found The Call's number, and called The Call herself. Luckily for her, The Call answered.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Films — Animation 

-   Lampshaded by Rhino the Hamster, the Ascended Fanboy from _Bolt_.
-   The inciting incident of _Frozen II_ is Elsa hearing the Call and jumping to follow it into the unknown and adventure.
-   _The Incredibles_:
    -   Robert Parr, a.k.a. Mr. Incredible. When he was forced to retire, he didn't fall into civilian life like other heroes did (like his wife Helen, alias Elastigirl, and his best friend Lucius alias Frozone) and missed the action. So much in fact, that he jumped at an opportunity that turned out too good to be true. This was subverted in the opening act, with Mr. Incredible saying in an interview that he doesn't see himself doing superhero work forever, and Elastigirl boasting about being on top of her game and not about to quit. They end up switching attitudes when they're later forced to act normal.
    -   Edna Mode also jumps at the chance to make superhero outfits again, after Robert calls her to patch up his old suit. She gets so into it, in fact, that she ends up making suits for all five members of the Parr family as _well_ as patching the old one.
-   Though the titular protagonist of _Moana_ initially does her best to resist the call and obey her parents' wishes, her lifelong wanderlust and love for the ocean means she eagerly leaps headlong into adventure once it becomes clear that her people need her to go and once she learns that her ancestors were in fact explorers who _also_ jumped at the call.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Trish from _Angels Revenge_. You do have to wonder about the wisdom of a teenaged schoolgirl with no combat skills deciding to force her way on to a team planning to take on a ruthless drug cartel.
-   _Big Ass Spider!_: Jose the hospital security guard gets "assigned" as the exterminator protagonist's sidekick and cheerfully follows him around Los Angeles trying to destroy the eponymous menace.
-   _Condorman_ features a lead character who doesn't merely jump at the call — he steals it. Woody Wilkins is a comic book writer who insists that his character (the eponymous Condorman) not do anything that he himself couldn't do in real life. It turns out that his friend works for the CIA and Woody talks him into letting him go on a routine courier mission, where he meets up with a lovely KGB spy named Natalia, who subsequently chooses to defect.
-   _Emperor (2020)_: Heroic and villainous versions appear.
    -   Shields volunteers for John Brown's near-suicidal raid on Harper's Ferry within hours, if not minutes, of meeting Brown and hearing his plan.
    -   McCabe and Grady encounter several farmers going to help the Army put down the raid on Harper's Ferry.
-   Johnny Storm in the _Fantastic Four (2005)_ film. One of the few positive points critics cited towards the film was the refreshing portrayal, away from the more depressing, wangsty examples, such as that of _Spider-Man_.
-   _The Fighting Seabees_: Donovan's men are eager to help the military fight Japanese invaders and avenge their dead friends.
-   _Godzilla vs. Kong_: Madison has no interest in staying in school as her Fantasy-Forbidding Father wants of her when Godzilla starts rampaging and she realizes no-one but her and Bernie are actually going to have the basic sense to investigate the Apex facilities Godzilla has been targeting. The novelization expands on this, showing that Mark has become a My Beloved Smother type of father after the previous movie's events who wants Madison to be as normal as possible, and that Madison is not fitting into normal life nor does she have any interest in pursuing it.
-   _Imperium Augustus_ shows the titular character so eager to answer The Call from his uncle Julius to fight in the Civil War that he decided to do so even though he was sick and remains so on the way to battle.
-   Until fairly recently, any _James Bond_ film fits this trope; Bond is briefed on some threat to the world and, without more than a few moments flirting with Moneypenny and collecting Gadgets from Q, dives straight into the fray. The few times when he's dodged the orders he's been given are still, mostly, him answering the call; his bosses are the ones who've misheard it. The Call has, however, been very, very personal in a few movies, most recently _Quantum of Solace_, where Bond runs off chasing a relatively minor bad guy with disproportionate interest, just because that bad guy is connected to the death of Vesper. He still hits the big bad guys where they live, but he almost stumbles on them by accident along the way. A similar pattern was last seen in _Licence to Kill_, which was followed by the Bond series stalling for six years. Thankfully, MGM/EON overcame their financial difficulties enough to announce that the next film would be released in 2012.
-   Barry Allen in _Justice League_, who eagerly volunteers to join before Bruce Wayne can even finish pitching the team to him.
    
    **Bruce**: Just like that?  
    **Barry**: Yeah, I...I need friends.
    
-   Dave Livewski, the title character of _Kickass_, who gets his powers (pain resistance and lots of titanium bones) as a result of answering the call before it's even been made.
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_:
    -   This is part of the reason why the _Iron Man_ films have been so successful. In contrast to heroes like Spider-Man and Batman, Tony Stark is a man who seems to genuinely enjoy being a hero and makes the most of his talents. It's refreshing to see a film where being a superhero actually looks fun and not like a chore.
    -   Steve Rogers in _Captain America: The First Avenger_ was very eager to answer the call, despite being put on hold multiple times due to his poor health. When offered the chance, he jumps at it with all his might and does everything he can to make sure he uses his powers for good. This logic also extends to his friends, who are only too happy to follow him into battle even after just escaping near-certain death.
    -   The MCU Spider-Man is _so_ eager to answer the call, Tony tries to get him to slow down (without much success). He spends most of his solo movie specifically trying to prove himself to the Avengers, to the point where he nearly forgets his original motive of helping the little guy.
-   In the reboot of _Star Trek (2009)_, the young Jim Kirk doesn't get the call for a few years after his peers. But once he does, he wastes no time in answering it.
-   Though the call in question is dubiously heroic, the Schofield Kid from _Unforgiven_ not only eagerly accepts it but enthusiastically spreads it to the baddest ass he knows. He has a change of heart after he finally kills someone.

    Literature 

-   Not only does Jeremy of _Abominable_ jump at the call when his aunt and uncle offer to teach him how to become a Hunter of Monsters, he's prepared to sneak out of his house _to another state_ with them if his parents try and stop him.
-   In Michael C. Bailey's _Action Figures - Issue One: Secret Origins_, Matt has wanted to be a superhero since he was a little kid and cajoles his friends into joining him when he sees an opportunity.
-   In _Black Legion_, the moment Falkius heard Sargon talk about the location of _Vengeful Spirit_ was the moment he decided he's going to get it, despite the directions to it being _extremely_ obscure. Similarly, Khayon joins him the moment he hears of the plan and after Children's attack incapacitates Falkius, he becomes the driving force behind the search. It helps that both were Desperately Looking for a Purpose in Life.
-   In _The Chronicles of Prydain_, Taran jumped _into_ the (literal) thornbush of adventure. When older and more experienced, he looked back at that incident as a sign of what an impulsive idiot he was when all he wanted was an adventure.
-   _Destined to Lead_: The main character, Kajiya, is certainly this. But her eagerness to Jump at the Call caused her to fall flat on her face. She ends up getting banished from the very tribe she is destined to lead.
-   In _The Dinosaur Lords_, when Karyl gets a job Training the Peaceful Villagers, he positively _blooms_, turning from a quiet, brooding man with a penchant for getting lost in his own thoughts into a decisive, gleeful and energetic commandeer.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   The protagonist, Harry, jumped at the chance to use his inborn magical powers for heroism, because (A) he was orphaned at a young age, and the evil warlock who adopted him was actively trying to either brainwash him into complete submission or murder him horribly. And (B) he had briefly felt hopeful under said warlock's care before said warlock revealed his true nature, annihilating his innocence, and he was sick of evil just randomly coming into his life and destroying everything he held dear. Once Harry actually got a decent mentor and some training in ethics, he was quite good at it, too.
    -   A less traumatic example occurs later in the series, with young wizard Molly Carpenter. She is extremely naive when first coming into her power — unfortunately, her magical talent is mental, i.e, telepathy and brainwashing — and in attempts to help her friends, she ends up breaking their minds. And the psychic backlash of _that_ attracts sadistic Fae that would like nothing more than to torture her in their distant, Alcatraz-esque fortress. Fortunately, Harry realizes this in time to rescue Molly, and after he becomes her mentor and teaches her about the dangers of the supernatural world, she becomes much more responsible and disciplined with her magic (Noticing a pattern here?)
    -   At the end of _Skin Game_, Waldo Butters is offered the chance to wield _Fidelacchius_ as a Knight of the Cross and says he can't imagine _not_ doing it.
-   The title character in _Eden Green_ mostly focuses on the downsides and horrors of being infected with an immortal needle symbiote, but her best friend loves it and quickly decides to become a vigilante monster-hunter.
-   In _Empire Star_ by Samuel R. Delany, when Comet Jo—a youth on the edge of adulthood from a backwater One-Product Planet, who never been anywhere but who calls _himself_ "Comet Jo"—is asked by a dying spaceman to take a message to Empire Star—a place he's never even heard of—he barely takes the time to stop by his home before heading off to the spaceport to investigate his transportation options.
-   Lampshaded in one of _The Executioner_ novels. A female journalist asks Vigilante Man Mack Bolan why he's engaged in his Roaring Rampage of Revenge against The Mafia. Bolan replies that he was "simply the one there when the duty roster was handed out". When she scoffs at this answer, Bolan replies that, just as it's ridiculous for him to assume she should give up her career in journalism and become a housewife, it's ridiculous for her to think he'll forsake his far-more extensive military skills (which he lists in detail) and ignore what the mob is doing to his own country.
-   The _Kingdom's Disdain_ Series: Cardinal finds himself with Identity Amnesia in a giant spider's web. When he escapes, he learns about an evil "Rot Lord". What does he do? Try to find a way home or to remember who he is? Nope! He decides he's "the chosen one" and sets off on an adventure.
-   Exaggerated in _Legacy of the Dragokin_ where Benji jumps at every chance he gets to be a hero despite his mom's best efforts to keep him away from them.
-   In _Leia, Princess of Alderaan_ a teenaged Princess Leia wants to help the fledgeling Rebel Alliance the moment she finds out someone is moving against The Empire. She literally performs data analysis to find an active Rebel base on Crait and takes a ship there so she can volunteer. Bail, who was thankfully on-base at the time, is terrified and furious - they might have shot her down! But finding out that her _parents_ are involved makes Leia all the more determined; knowing they're ethical people, she finds her few doubts clearing. Bail and Breha try to keep her ignorant in the hopes that this will protect her if they're caught, but without ever ignoring their specific requests and orders Leia pushes and keeps getting herself increasingly entangled. By the end of the novel she's tasted loss for the first time and realizes with a little sadness that her childhood is over but is fully committed.
-   _Light and Dark: The Awakening of the Mage Knight_: Danny can't wait to become a Knight of the Light, and neither can his friends. Their first year of training is a test of their commitment to the call.
-   Sam Gamgee in _The Lord of the Rings_ is thrilled by the prospect of "going to see Elves and all." Merry and Pippin are also insistent on coming along - and have a "conspiracy" set up to keep Frodo from leaving the Shire without them - but that's more the Power of Friendship.
-   Quentin Coldwater of _The Magicians_ is almost explosive with enthusiasm when he realizes he's just passed the entrance exam for a Wizarding School, and blithely flings himself into a life of study and magic. No surprise, given that Quentin's been Desperately Looking for a Purpose in Life.
-   Mark, from _Mark Delewen and the Space Pirates_, not only jumps at the chance, he specifically convinces the Space Patrolman to take him along, although he wouldn't have otherwise.
-   The title character in Dorothy Gilman's _Mrs. Pollifax_ series went to the CIA to volunteer to become a spy because she was finding retirement boring. She's surprisingly effective in spite of — or perhaps because of — being a sweet little old lady who looks like she wouldn't harm a fly.
-   Elin from _Of Fear and Faith_ jumped at the chance to join Phenix's party, especially since she'd been alone in the woods for who knows how long before then. North and Tel also seem quite enthusiastic about going on a mysterious and dangerous journey and the three of them are probably having the best time out of the group.
-   In the _Rainbow Magic_ series, Rachel and Kirsty agreed to help the fairies immediately.
-   In _Secret Of The Three Treasures_ by Janni Lee Simner (author of _Bones of Faerie_), the fourth-grade protagonist, Tiernay West, is so eager to become a professional adventurer like the protagonist of her father's novels that she wears her Indiana Jones hat everywhere and interprets _everything_ by the relevant tropes. When she hears of a local legend about buried treasure, she jumps at the call so quickly, it leaves her mother's head spinning.
-   Stephanie Edgely, the 12-year old heroine of the book _Skulduggery Pleasant_, is only too glad to enter a fantastic world of magic, living skeletons, and vampiric museum guards.
    -   It's subverted in the second book where many characters point out that Stephanie appears a bit _too_ eager to join the supernatural world and misses out on a lot of experiences with her family and people her own age, and they try to explain to her that this is not a good thing (to little avail). It's most poignantly illustrated when the mirror image she sends to live her normal life tells her at one point that she has no friends at school (something she had been unaware of).
-   This trope was what made Archmaester Marwyn so memorable and well-liked in the fandom of _A Song of Ice and Fire_. While most characters are frightened of the rapidly shifting world around them, Marwyn showed up in one chapter, and by the end, he was on a boat to Essos to become Daenerys' maester.
    -   Another notable call-jumper in this series is Jon Snow. When presented with an option to join the Night's Watch, he volunteered instantly. Once there, he desired to become a ranger and go beyond the Wall.
-   Galen Waylock of _War of the Dreaming_ leaps at the call. He had the training, the skills, the attitude. Unfortunately, his timing was a little off.
-   _Wearing the Cape_: Atlas (a part-time baggage handler) and most of the other original super-powered individuals were caught by surprise when they first got powers during the Blackout, but they immediately went to work helping victims of the disaster.
-   _The Wheel of Time_:
    -   Most of the main characters were terrified at having to flee their isolated little village in order to lead the ravening monsters away from their loved ones. Egwene hid in a hayloft to make sure they didn't leave without her.
    -   Many of the false dragons, Logain in particular. He didn't just proclaim himself to gain power, but honestly thought he was the Dragon Reborn, destined to save the world. His being gentled justifies his bitterness and cynicism in the latter half of the series.
        
        ''"I stood forth to fight," Logain said. "And what was my reward? Ask the Red Ajah. They will tell you the reward of a man abused of the Pattern." He barked a laugh. "The Pattern demanded a Dragon! And so I came! Too soon. Just a little too soon."
        
-   In _The Wonderful Adventures of Nils_, Mårten, upon hearing the call of wild geese to travel north, discovers that he can fly and leaves the farm to join them.

    Live-Action TV 

-   This is a recurring characteristic of many of the heroes in the Arrowverse. Barry Allen didn't take a whole lot of convincing to become The Flash, Wally West went looking for power to be a hero, Jesse Wells apparently took about 5 seconds to decide she was going to be a hero when she discovered her speed, Ray Palmer made a super-suit to become a superhero, Nate Heywood took to having superpowers like a fish to water, and Kara Danvers took to the air to perform a rescue and decided to finally be a superhero then and there.
-   Almost all the women working at the munitions factory in _Bomb Girls_ were eager to do so, for many different reasons.
-   _Buffyverse_:
    -   Faith's far more enthusiastic acceptance of being The Chosen One compared to Buffy in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_.
        -   In the seventh-season episode "Potential", this trope is turned on its head when Dawn at first jumps at the Call — after all, she's one of the only non-powered people among a bunch of superheroes, and the youngest to boot! - only to find out that the Call _wasn't for her after all_. Talk about a downer. Then again, in the Season 8 comics, she gets perhaps more than she bargained for.
    -   _Angel_: Zig-zagged with Connor: whether his usual or alternate self, he seems pretty enthusiastic about being a superhuman, but not the accompanying violence and trauma. His arc in the TV series ends with him choosing a normal life. "This whole fighting thing... I'm not really sure it's for me."
-   Jeff and Lester jump at the call in season 5 of _Chuck_ when Casey asks them to liberate his daughter, Morgan and Awesome. Lester turns to Jeff and lampshades this rather dramatically, before rushing to get guns. Give them credit, though, it worked.
    
    **Lester**: It's the call.
    
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Doctor didn't just jump at the call, they stole a TARDIS and went looking for it.
    -   In terms of the Doctor's companions, this serves as a distinction between the old and the new series. Becoming a companion in the old series is much less voluntary, a moment of what's in that box and sometimes continues under some duress. In the current series, the Doctor seems to pick companions based on this trope. The more reluctant ones (such as Mickey and Rory) have to work a lot harder to be taken seriously.
    -   In "Smith and Jones", Martha catches the Doctor's attention by being the first person in the hospital to figure out that the air's being kept in somehow, and being willing to go onto the balcony in order to test that theory despite the danger.
    -   Donna Noble, in her second appearance. After kicking herself for not taking the Doctor up on his initial offer, she hounded every event and incident in London that seemed the least bit strange and Doctor-worthy in the hopes that he'd happen to show up and she could tell him that she'd changed her mind and would like to come along after all.
    -   Jenny, the Tenth Doctor's daughter/Opposite-Sex Clone from series 4, follows in her Dad's footsteps after recovering from a Disney Death, stealing a spaceship and flying off in search of adventure.
    -   As of "The Doctor's Wife", the TARDIS of all things turns out to have jumped at the call as well. She wanted to see the universe, so she left her doors unlocked and stole a Time Lord.
    -   Although initially inverted with the original version of Clara Oswald, who was quite hesitant to do anything with the Doctor who she thought initially a bit creepy, this trope, combined with In Harm's Way, becomes a defining aspect of the character — and a constant source of concern (and, later, heartbreak) for the Doctor.
    -   After initially being accidentally teleported along with the Doctor at the end of "The Woman Who Fell to Earth", upon returning home to Sheffield in "Arachnids in the UK" and getting embroiled in another adventure, at the end of the episode, companions Ryan, Graham and Yaz decide to come travelling with the Doctor completely of their own volition this time, even after she warns them it will be dangerous and change them forever.
-   William of _Downton Abbey_, who is eager to fight for his country on the front lines in World War I. He finally gets drafted and goes to war... and is mortally wounded at the battle of Amiens.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Jon Snow is very eager to join the Night's Watch despite his uncle's advice to wait a while longer. Later, he jumps at the chance to join Qhorin Halfhand's ranging. Mance Rayder picks up on this trait very quickly, saying that he believes that the thing Jon wants, most of all, is to be a hero.
    -   When Davos comes to get Gendry in Flea Bottom he's expecting a long-winded speech to convince Gendry to leave his shop. Gendry goes with nary a word of protest, pulling out a pre-made bug-out bag and grabbing up a warhammer he made himself. According to him, he's sick of making weapons for the men that killed his father and has been prepping for this day for years.
-   _Heroes_:
    -   Hiro Nakamura recognised his powers the second he got them and did everything he could to develop them so he could become a Super Hero. He didn't just jump at the call; he'd spent his life sitting by the phone.
    -   Early in the series, Peter Petrelli shows similar tendencies, spouting lines like "Do you ever think you were meant for something greater?" to then-strangers.
    -   Gabriel Gray would give up his abilities in a heartbeat for a little approval. When he remakes himself as Sylar, however, he not only jumps at his call but at anyone else's he can get his hands on.
-   _Kamen Rider Fourze_ Gentaro Kisaragi jumped so fast he forgot to ask what he was being called for. Or how to use his newly acquired Transformation Trinket.
-   _Killing Eve_: Eve, Bill, and Elena all jump at the chance to join the task force headed by Carolyn to hunt down Villanelle. Eve, because she's spent years chained to a desk, has just been fired by her "dick-swab" boss, Frank, and is fascinated by female serial killers, Villanelle in particular. Bill, because he's Eve's best friend and felt she was fired unfairly, and because Frank fired him too when he tried to defend her. And Elena, because she greatly admires Carolyn and was thrilled to have a chance to work for her. (And also because, like everyone, she hated working for Frank, anyway.)
-   _M\*A\*S\*H_ has a non-superhero example in the eighth season episode "The Yalu Brick Road". The entire camp, save for Charles, Margaret, B.J., Hawkeye, and Father Mulcahy has come done with food poisoning from turkeys Klinger got for Thanksgiving. While B.J. and Hawkeye are getting antibiotics from another unit, Charles and Margaret come back from a medical conference to find Father Mulcahy (who was at a nearby orphanage) is now taking care of everyone. While Father Mulcahy is sorry everyone is sick, he's thrilled to be helping out, as he's always worried about whether or not he's been useful, and taking care of everyone when they're sick is definitely being useful.
-   _Odd Squad_:
    
    -   Olympia from "Assistant's Creed" is very eager to become an agent and doesn't like being stuck as one of Ms. O's assistants. She's so eager to jump at the call that she decides to venture out into the town and solve oddness on her own, with Ozric, who's also an assistant, being dragged along for the ride. Both of them end up becoming agents by the episode's end.
    -   The Season 3 premiere "Odd Beginnings" revolves around Opal, an Investigation agent working in an Odd Squad Headquarters situated in the Arctic, wanting to get out of the Arctic and be transferred to a different precinct where she can put her skills to good use. When she receives a letter from another agent named Oswald about a map leading to the legendary 44-leaf clover, she's more than ready to set out on an adventure to find the artifact, and convinces her partner Omar to come along as well. Oswald is more than eager to tag along with them when they meet up, and Orla, the guardian of the clover, also joins them once she finds that they can be trusted.
    -   The trope gets a Deconstruction in "The Thrill of the Face" as it follows up from "Odd Beginnings", only focusing on Oswald instead of Opal and Omar as it reveals how he jumped at the call to adventure and joined the duo so he could experience life beyond sitting behind a desk, but failed to realize just how much oddness exists in the world. He admits to Orla that he put on a brave facade for her, Opal and Omar because they jumped at the call and weren't afraid, but she assures him that despite his Cowardly Lion tendencies, he's still a valuable part of the Odd Squad Mobile Unit.
    
    **Orla:** You told me you joined OSMU to get _out_ from behind your desk.
    
    **Oswald:** That was before I know how much scary stuff there was out there. You were right. I'm afraid.
    
    _\[Oswald leans back in his chair\]_
    
    **Orla:** It is okay to be afraid. You would not be a part of this team if we did not believe in you. _You_ need to start believing in you, too.
    
    _\[Oswald sits back up\]_
    
    **Oswald:** _\[exhales\]_ Okay.
    
-   _Orphan Black_: Sarah seesaws between this and Refusal of the Call in the early episodes.
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   Mack from _Power Rangers Operation Overdrive_ jumps at the call to become Red Ranger. This is against his father's wishes, as said father was originally going to be Red himself before his son snuck the morpher out from under him.
    -   Most Rangers Jumped at the Call when initially offered ("We get to be POWER RANGERS? AWESOME!"), only to later realize what being a Ranger actually _means_ and develop an I Just Want to Be Normal attitude.
    -   In the original _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_, Jason (the Red Ranger) is the first to agree with the giant floating head telling him and his friends they have to save the world from an evil alien witch.
    -   Even when she was stealing from the rich to give to the poor, Z from _Power Rangers S.P.D._ wanted to do more to help people. When she and her best friend Jack finally got arrested and Cruger offered them a place in S.P.D., she jumped at the chance to be part of something bigger and makes a difference, compared to his reluctance.
-   In _Ressha Sentai ToQger_, Right Suzuki jumped so quickly, he forgot to ask for his Transformation Trinket.
-   John Watson in _Sherlock_, not long returned from the war in Afganistan.
    
    **Sherlock**: \[You've seen a\] bit of trouble too, I bet.  
    **John**: Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime, far too much.  
    **Sherlock**: Want to see some more?  
    **John**: Oh God, yes.
    
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   While his brother, Sam, instead jumped at the chance to go to college, Dean stayed on with hunting and loved it. (This was before he was broken. Now he's not exactly so eager about it.) Arguably this could be more because he followed his Dad's orders without question and couldn't even comprehend disobeying than anything to do with noble heroics. And it took a confused English teacher at a random school to teach Sam that he _could_ go to college himself.
    -   And then there's Jimmy, who didn't so much jump at the chance to serve God as Castiel's vessel as wildly fling himself at it. It's kind of an understatement just to say he actually prayed for this... Though he regrets it once he figures out what it actually entails.
-   Similar to the above, patriotic Charlotte from _Unsere Mütter, unsere Väter_ eagerly volunteers to serve as a nurse on the Eastern Front.
-   _The X-Files_: Special Agent Leyla Harrison, who had been following Mulder's and Scully's adventures through their expense reports, was thrilled to team up with Doggett in the episode "Alone".

    Myths & Religion 

-   The Bible:
    -   Isaiah, after having a vision of God and having his sins (symbolically) cleansed (Isaiah 6:8):
        
        _Then I heard the voice of my Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?"  
        And I said, "Here am I; send me."_
        
    -   Other Old Testament figures who jumped at the call: Noah, Abraham (though he did have lapses later), Jacob (but he only wanted God's blessings; it took more Character Development to turn him into a proper patriarch), Elisha, Jerobam (it didn't last), Jehu (it didn't last)...
    -   When Jesus gathered the Twelve Apostles, it was simply a matter of going to their homes/jobs and saying "Follow me". It is described that they left immediately, including leaving their nets in the water (some were fishermen).
-   _Classical Mythology:_ Achilles was hidden away from the world by his mother, who wanted him to have a long but boring life instead of the glorious but short one that he was fated to live if he answered the call. She only relented when she saw how miserable he was, and he did indeed live a short but momentous life as one of the heroes of the Trojan war.
-   Muhammad's early Sahabah ("the Companions") immediately believed in his Prophethood the moment he told them about it. They would become prominent figures in Islam later, including the successors to Muhammad's leadership of the Islamic civilization after his death.
-   _Nart Sagas_: In the epos of the North Caucasus, the heroic Narts were given the choice between a long and comfortable life without glory, or a short life filled with great feats and heroic deeds. They don't spare a moment to respond in favor of fame and glory.

-   In _Jemjammer_, Cacophony is quite eager to be hired by Alana to find the fallen stars despite only meeting her a few moments ago.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   A rare villainous example: At _WCW Slamboree 95_, May 21, 1995, Kevin Sullivan defeated The Man With No Name (Brutus Beefcake). After the match, The Master (King Curtis Iaukea) appeared on the Jumbotron to tell Sullivan that Hulkamania must be stopped. Sullivan ran out of the Bayfront Center in St. Petersburg, FL. This was followed by a sketch on _WCW Saturday Night_ of Sullivan, still in his wrestling trunks, running through a forest until he found The Master, who Teleported him into a room. The Master turned Sullivan into "The Taskmaster," leading to the formation of The Dungeon of Doom.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Anathema_, Violent shrouds do this, as a group. Violent shrouds were talented killers when they were alive and they're tasked with decreasing the human population as much as possible. They usually either try to outclass each other's kill counts, just to see if they can, or use their powers to seek out and kill their old enemies. Either way, they take to their vocation very well.

    Theatre 

-   In _Hamilton_, the title character is eager to prove himself and make a mark on history. When Washington starts apologizing for asking him to join the cabinet and thus leave his family for extended period, Hamilton interrupts because all he wants to know is if he'll be running the Treasury or State Department.
-   In the _Mrs. Hawking_ play series, when Mary learns that Mrs. Hawking is a secret Batman-style crusader for justice, she immediately begs to be allowed to help her in her work.
    -   After briefly trying to stop his aunt from her missions, Nathaniel becomes this trope too. Mrs. Hawking is loath to bring him on at first but eventually realizes that his gifts as The Face are useful.

    Video Games 

-   In _Advanced V.G. II's_ opening story mode cutscene, Tamao recounts how she first saw Yuka on television and was so awestruck by her, that she decided to sign up for the tournament, herself, in order to meet her new role model in hopes of becoming her student. She was even referring to Yuka as "sempai", _before ever meeting her_. Why settle for being a highschool girl, when you can partner up with VG's strongest waitress and her friends?
-   During the present day portion of _Assassin's Creed II_, Desmond Miles immediately agrees to join the assassins in their war against the Templars. Lucy is surprised by his cooperation and admits she was prepared to talk him into it.
-   _Betrayal at Krondor_: After initially trying not to get himself involved in the situation, Owyn has a chance to continue with the quest - and eagerly takes it. When Gorath and James sneak out of Krondor to go and investigate the moredhel threat, Owyn intercepts them and insists that if he isn't taken along, he'll surely talk to the wrong person by accident on the way home and jeopardize their mission - essentially throwing the reason he was initially forced to come along back in their faces.
-   Jessie Faden from _Control_ Plays With this trope. On one hand, she's not really comfortable with being in a position of authority, especially as the Director of the Bureau that she had been hunting down for most of her life for kidnapping her brother. On the other hand, she adapts quickly to the new paradigm and readily admits several times that she never wants to leave this new weird and crazy world she's found herself in.
-   The player does this in _Dark Souls_. Given that the choice was either this or rot in his cell for all eternity, it's easy to see why.
-   The Shape of _Dead by Daylight_. While the other killers found their way accidentally, unwillingly, or obliviously into the service of The Entity, Myers is the only killer who voluntarily joined it.
-   Dante of the _Devil May Cry_ series loves his work and actively flaunts his powers whenever possible.
-   Midori 'Dolly' Komaki of _Devil Survivor_ is a cosplaying camgirl. Once she witnesses your small band of survivors battling demons with your own summoned Mons, she squeals at the thought of "real heroes!" and snatches up a COMP of her very own. Unfortunately, she apparently snags an Idiot Ball along with it...
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   Most of the Origin stories in _Dragon Age: Origins_ allow the player character to either drag his/her feet and try to reject recruitment by the Grey Wardens or eagerly badger authority figures to be allowed to join.
    -   In _Dragon Age II_, according to the codex, this is true of a Mage Hawke. Part of the reason Bethany was so close to her elder sibling was that she looked up to them with a mixture of envy and awe for being able to so completely embrace their mage identity, while she always viewed their gift as a terrible burden.
-   _Dragon Quest_:
    -   _Dragon Quest II_: The Prince of Midenhall sets off on a quest to save his kingdom as soon as he finds out that Moonbrooke has been razed to the ground. Even shown jumping from his throne to listen to the Moonbrooke guard in the Japanese manual.
    -   _Dragon Quest V_: The speechless hero either wanders or sneaks off to adventures to save people _three times_ during his childhood, much to his father's worry.
    -   Prince Keifer in _Dragon Quest VII_ didn't just jump at the call, he's spent years _tracking it down_. When he finally finds it, his first battle causes him to burst into enthusiastic laughter.
    -   _Dragon Quest IX_ has the Player Character. While most Celestrians are Resigned to the Call and, had they been in the Player Character's position, would have probably stopped bothering since their task had by then been completed. You on the other hand, despite having no one pushing you and no way to get back to the Observatory with the Benevolessence, still continue helping the villagers without hesitation. Also when Celestria talks to you in your sleep, asking you to collect the fyggs, you do so without a second thought.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   In the series' backstory, near the end of the 2nd Era, the Greybeards summoned The Chosen One who would restore the Empire and conquer the elves to High Hrothgar, their monastery on the Throat of the World. Two heroes of mankind jumped at this call:
        -   Wulfharth Ash-King, the legendary ancient King of the Nords, famous Shezarrine who had died and come back to life at least three times, and noted Elf-hater, jumped at the call and went to the Greybeards. Instead, Wulfharth is "blasted to ash" by the Greybeards, who say that he is not the one.
        -   Tiber Septim was the founder of the Third Tamriellic Empire who ascended after his death as Talos, the Ninth Divine. When the Greybeards summoned him, he jumped at the chance. He went to them, accepted their title, studied with them to increase the power of his Thu'um, and ventured south to Cyrodiil to forge an empire on their word. While official Imperial orthodoxy records him as humble and pious, more heretical (and realistic) stories note Septim's extreme ambition playing a role.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Zack Fair from the _Final Fantasy VII_ prequel _Crisis Core_, and to an initially less-successful extent, Cloud, in the original _Final Fantasy VII_ game. Zack continued to want to be a hero to the end. Cloud became far more reluctant after a while, though he still demonstrates a need to protect and rescue people he cares about.
    -   Garnet in _Final Fantasy IX_ absolutely does this when the Tantalus Theatre Troupe came in to kidnap her. Turns out the Troupe was doing this by Uncle Cid's word. So she absolutely takes this chance to escape her castle.
    -   Tidus in _Final Fantasy X_ is generally unconcerned about suddenly being yanked out of his world, and eagerly follows Yuna around even after initially being told he can't be one of her guardians. Considering he may have been a Unwitting Pawn, created by the fayth to stop Sin, and based on the poor bastard from Zanarkand who tried and failed to stop the senseless war, his eagerness makes sense.
    -   _Final Fantasy XIII-2_: After losing Lightning and Snow, and hearing nothing for two years, all it takes is a small-scale monster invasion and the word of mysterious youth Noel to send Serah traipsing across time and space in search of her sister.
-   Riku of _Kingdom Hearts_ felt that there was something more for him beyond his homeworld. He was right. Unfortunately, The Dark Side was apparently aware of this as well, and Riku was too impatient to wait _one more night_.
-   Subverted in _Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning_. The call (Fate) doesn't have any hold over you. High King Tatarion praises you if you choose to save the world saying that while answering the call is all well and good, **YOU** chose to be the hero and that makes you a true hero.
-   One of the Aesops of _Last Scenario_ is that jumping at the call is a stupid, _stupid_ idea. Late in the game, the protagonist lists off four major characters who each tried to become heroes, and each wound up doing something horrible.
-   While no Link is terribly reluctant to receive the Call to Adventure, Link from _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_ stands out in that, not only was there no divine destiny planned out for him by the goddesses as there was for the others but he straight out _demanded_ to be taken to the Call (after unsuccessfully following it off a cliff). The fact that the Call kidnapped his little sister might have something to do with it.
-   Most of your companions in _Mass Effect_ go willingly, but Garrus spends the next three games thanking you for getting him out of C-Sec and on to saving the Galaxy.
-   Twilight Sparkle eagerly decides to investigate Rarity's case in _My Little Investigations_
-   Travis Touchdown of _No More Heroes_ fame is an otaku who spends 95% of his time watching wrestling tapes, various anime, and occasionally going out and slaughtering en masse. He buys a beam katana off of eBay, then when a random woman in a bar asks him to decapitate someone with it, is only too happy to do so. Then again, he also loves to grab the Idiot Ball as well.
-   All the Villain Protagonists in the _Overlord_ series eagerly embrace their destinies. Even the Overlord of the original game completely ignores the reveal that he's actually a literal Hero groomed to be the previous Overlord's puppet placeholder, and instead kicks his predecessor's butt and keeps the title and power for himself.
-   _Persona 5_: The Lancer on your team, Ryuji Sakamoto, turns out to be a bit of geek for Phantom Thief related tropes, to the point he suggests you form a thief Badass Crew, and begs to make your Calling Card for your first job.
    -   In terms of awakenings, Makoto is the one who replies to her Deal with the Devil with enthusiastic consent.

Johanna: Have you decide to walk the path of strife? Makoto: Yes! Come to me!

-   The protagonist in _Quest for Glory I: So You Want To Be A Hero_ goes out looking for quests to complete so that he can gain the title of hero after graduating from the "Famous Adventurer's Correspondance School".
-   _Sam & Max_ will take any case from anyone (as long as they get paid) and always eagerly fight to answer the phone when it starts ringing. Sam always wins. (Except when the timestream was messed with, or when hell froze over.)
-   Ryusei Date of _Shin Super Robot Wars_, _Super Robot Wars Alpha_ and _OG_ might as well be the poster boy for this trope. In his first appearance in _Shin_, Hamaguchi orders him to sortie in his R-1, telling him not to press his luck since reinforcements will arrive soon. Ryusei has been waiting for this chance for a long time and isn't planning on not pushing his luck. His highly confident battle cry does little to inspire the staffers, but they have little choice but to leave it up to him. He beats up the aliens with backup from Raideen, but Hamaguchi gives Ryusei a good chewing out for pushing the still experimental R-1 so hard, threatening to ground him if he pulls any more reckless stunts.
-   _So Many Me_: At the start of the game, when Filo first meets Asimov, he introduces himself as the projection of a world long forgotten. Filo deduces Asimov's world is in danger, and he's the only one who can save it, which Asimov concurs. Filo decides to have his adventure and jumps into the fountain before Asimov has a chance to tell him anything he's need to know.
-   _Soulcalibur_: This is the reason Han Myong's daughter, Seong Mina, is still unwed at 24 years old - because she'd rather travel the continent in search of Soul Edge and do battle with evil. By _SC II_, he had given up on trying to marry her off and accepted she just wasn't the type to sit idly by. So it was hardly any surprise to him that she had already set off on another journey.
-   _Star Trek Online_: By her own admission, Lieutenant Jirelle Kav, the operations officer of the USS _Enterprise_\-F, didn't need much convincing to take that post.
-   _Tales of Destiny 2_: Due to having heard so many stories about his father's adventures as a great hero, Kyle Dunamis is obsessed with becoming a hero himself, and jumps as soon as a Mysterious Waif claims to be looking for one, no questions asked.
-   _Them's Fightin' Herds_: In Chapter 1 of story mode, Arizona volunteered herself to become The Prairie's Champion/ Key Seeker when none of the other Cattlekind were brave enough to take on the role.
-   Joe of _Viewtiful Joe_, who had watched _tokusatsu_ films and TV shows all his life and actively embraced his own chance to be an action hero.
    -   Which is reversed in the anime adaptation, where Joe doesn't seem to want more than an autograph.
-   In _X3: Terran Conflict_ the minor character Jesan Nadina is extremely gung-ho about joining the fight against the Khaak because he hero-worships Julian Gardna-Brennan, the Player Character of the previous two games who was instrumental in defeating the first two major Khaak offensives. He gets killed off-screen two missions into the corresponding plot.
-   _ZanZarah: The Hidden Portal_: While alone at home, Amy investigates a strange noise from the attic. She is transported to a parallel dimension and told that she must save it from some vague evil, with zero directions at how to do so. She takes it all in stride and dives right into exploring this strange new world.

However, the people in the village will assume she got kidnapped for real, which leads to the Hero beginning his journey...
-   The heroine of _Queen of Thieves_ is a struggling artist on the verge of having to give up on her dreams and return to her hometown in defeat when the infamous thieves known as the Gilded Poppy show up wanting to recruit her for a heist. They provide extra incentive by implicating her as their accomplice in a couple of thefts, but considering the eagerness with which she grabs onto the offer, they probably didn't need to go to quite that much trouble.
    
    **Heroine**: (Isn't this what I was waiting for? Excitement? Adventure? To escape an ordinary life?)

She calls Jaune's team, who agree to help her out, and is eventually reunited with her own team along the way. The mission to Haven Academy reveals more than they bargained for, but Ruby becomes determined to stop the villains anyway. Once the protagonists learn the truth about The Chosen One and the Forever War between the Big Bad and Big Good, she decides to take control of the entire fight as The Unchosen One, due to the former Chosen One being too burned out and the new Chosen One initially being too untrained.

She finally gets her wish at the end of _Krakow 2.0_, when Marilith accepts her as a partner. In _Marilith_ she gets trained in pistols and sniper rifles, and plays a pivotal role in most of Marilith's fights and plans.

He doesn't even seem to hear them.
    
    -   It even has a Red Pill, Blue Pill scene with the girl mentioned above.
    
    **Katrina**: I can have Akila wipe your memory of all this, and have you wake up in your bed and live your life as a normal person, or you can stay here with me, continue to live in this world, and see things as they really are.
    
-   In _Rusty and Co._, Rusty and Mimic start by hunting for a call; they had, after all, become Monster Adventurers because the adventurer lifespan exceeds the monster one.
-   Played for laughs in this<small>◊</small> _Slice of Life_ strip, where Pinkie Pie flies into battle (on balloons!) to stop a rampaging monster from stomping the town.
    
    **Pinkie Pie**: No time today, Mrs. Cake! The world is in danger!
    
-   Riff from _Sluggy Freelance_ loves nothing more than building absurdly overpowered weapons and using them to reduce evil monsters to smithereens.

He once tried putting some of his robots into storage—this didn't go so well.

    -   Emil was really interested in a seemingly easy way of proving himself worthy of a promotion. The remnants of his days as a pampered rich kid very likely didn't agree well with the usual career progression routes.
    -   Compared to her usual job, the expedition is a vacation with a pay to Sigrun.
    -   Trond from Mission Control got recruited at his own retirement party and really needed something to keep him busy.
-   _Touhou Project_'s Reimu in _Touhou Nekokayou_ seems to enjoy her job, to say the least.
    
    **Sakuya**: I thought you and Marisa would want to help investigate since you're Gensokyo's premier incident-solvers.  
    **Reimu**: You flatter me because it's true! Also, do you know what this means? IT IS TIME TO RESOLVE AN INCIDENT! _\[clenches fist\]_

    Web Original 

-   In _Atop the Fourth Wall: The Movie_, all of Linkara's friends immediately volunteer to help him rescue the crew of the _Caelestis_, with Nash in particular wanting to come along just so he can get the chance to go into outer space.
-   _Critical Role_: Caduceus Clay, a priest to the Wildmother living at one of her most sacred temples, chose to leave with the Mighty Nein immediately to help save their captured friends. Afterwards, he stuck around on their travels, becoming the group's Combat Medic. He later reveals that he had a prophetic dream the night before, and that his bags were fully packed by the time the Nein walked in. He wasn't exactly reluctant to leave — he spent years living alone after the rest of his family left and didn't return, and recounts that period of his life as a timeless blur where no-one, not even the Wildmother, could see him.
-   As much as Rob from the web fiction serial _Dimension Heroes_ was reluctant at first, it didn't take him long to realize that kicking inter-dimensional monster butt with futuristic superpowers is a lot more fun than sitting around the house all summer.
-   In the _Noob_ webseries and novels, Arthéon at some point decides that he needs a new start in life, so he decides to leave his gaming guild and become a solo player. He however quickly realizes that he has no idea what to do with the time that he formerly used up helping out his guild, so he plays this trope quite straight when he gets an e-mail that amounts to "Hi, this is the game creator. I have a job for you if you happen to be interested.".
-   In the _Red Panda Adventures_, chauffeur Kit Baxter becomes the Red Panda's sidekick, the Flying Squirrel, by figuring out her boss was the masked vigilante and demanding she be allowed in on the action.
-   Himei of _Sailor Nothing_ initially jumped at the chance to be a magical girl just like on TV and fight The Heartless. Unfortunately for her, this turns out to have been a Bad Idea and completely irreversible.
-   _Whateley Universe_:
    -   Chaka was a very unhappy transgender boy who finally got the hot (female) body she had always dreamed of, ass-kicking Ki powers, the chance to finally tell off her two older siblings, and the chance to go to Superhero School and drag her new friends into mishaps and adventures.
    -   Or Monolith/Stronghold, who was dying to get superpowers as soon as his older sister did and he realized it was even a possibility. Now he's a Flying Brick who looks like he was drawn by Rob Liefeld and loving every minute of it. Except he has to get through high school too.

    Western Animation 

-   On _Adventure Time_ the main characters Finn and Jake often jump at any excuse to have an adventure, which is a main premise of the show (hence the title _Adventure Time_). One example is in the episode "The Enchiridion!" where the princess of the local kingdom Princess Bubblegum challenges Finn to seek out a book for heroes, which Finn enthusiastically obliges by saying "I am _into_ this stuff!"
-   On _The Awesomes_, Jeremy (aka "Prock"), son of celebrated superhero Mr. Awesome, jumps at the chance to reestablish Mr. Awesome's superhero team known as "The Awesomes" after his retirement. Prock has no powers other than the ability to stop time, and is made fun of or ignored by everyone because of it.
-   Ben Tennyson from _Ben 10_. Watch an episode, _any_ episode; he's running headlong towards the Monster of the Week (or a filler fight scene) before the first ad break. He has a code name for _each_ of his _many_ alter egos, _never_ backs down from a fight... and several episodes heavily imply that he'd still like even _more_ excitement in his life. When he realized what he could do, his first thought was being able to help people. Deconstructed a bit in the Made-for-TV Movie _The Secret Of The Omnitrix_, when Ben's thrill-seeking aspects impede on his heroics among other problems.
    -   In the Alternate Universe episode "Gwen 10", Gwen, while calmer and more responsible, is similarly thrilled with the powers of the Omnitrix and the adventure it entails. In the regular universe, she starts learning magic and becomes part of the adventure.
-   All of the young Planeteers from _Captain Planet and the Planeteers_ accepted their role in defending the Earth without hesitation.
-   _Kim Possible_'s Teen Superspy adventures begin when her website, intended to pick up odd jobs for pocket money, accidentally gets a call meant for heroes-for-hire Team Impossible. Still, she jumps at the chance to save the day and never looks back.
-   _The Legend of Korra_: Avatar Korra, unlike her predecessor Aang, seems to LOVE being the Avatar. This may be justified by the difference in their ages when they each found out they were the Avatar. Aang was twelve, old enough to have his own identity as a person, leaving him to struggle to incorporate this new facet into himself. Korra was four, so it's likely she can't remember a time when she didn't know she was the Avatar.
    -   Later deconstructed. Her mentors were so busy training her in how to wield the elements that they separated Korra from her family, and wouldn't let her have a social life. (In the second episode she makes a full-blown escape attempt just to see a _sports match,_ and her interactions with teens her own age make it rather clear she's never had any human friends.) This blows up in everyone's face around the season 1 finale when Korra was able to defeat the conquering tyrant, but not before he manages to sever a majority of her elemental abilities. Without her elemental powers, her status as the Avatar, which she has been training for her entire life, is essentially useless, and that _hundreds_ of people will die because of her failure. She doesn't know who she is outside of the Avatar's current incarnation, and that knowledge nearly kills her.
        -   Eventually this is reconstructed. By the end of the series, Korra has managed to gain many friends, and she has managed to become a confident young woman, and she is happy to fulfill her role as the Avatar.
    -   Another case is with Kuvira, who after hearing about the plight of the Earth Kingdom after the Red Lotus had killed The Earth Queen had caused the nation to descend into violent chaos. The World Leaders had approached Zaofu to request for Suyin Beifong to offer her aid and stabilize the situation, only for Suyin to refuse even when she was the most qualified person for the job. Kuvira, Bataar Jr., and the entirety of Zaofus' security force decides to go help stabilize the Earth Kingdom on their own; even with Suyin threatening to never allow them back in the city again.
        
        **Kuvira**: When I do return, it will be on _my own_ terms.
        

-   Coop of _Megas XLR_ both plays it straight and subverts it. As implied by the opening theme song, he digs his giant robot. However, The Call is actually Kiva's insistence that he save humanity in the future, and Coop's fondness of that is decidedly lacking. He likes to fight, but it's more about having a giant robot than following the call.
-   Adrien Agreste from _Miraculous Ladybug_ jumped at the call to become Chat Noir, as he was desperate for some freedom from his micromanaging father. He was _so_ eager to accept, he didn't wait for Plagg to explain how all his powers worked.
    -   Lila Rossi has been akumatized multiple times. The third time, as soon as she saw an akuma approaching, she grabbed it and shoved it into her earring, then straight-up propositioned Hawk Moth for powers in return for defeating Ladybug before he could say anything. Hawk Moth was impressed to say the least.
-   On _Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja_, the first thing the titular character does after being told that he is now a heroic Ninja tasked with protecting his school is exclaim about how awesome it is and immediately wears the ninja mask. Randy does later face the burdens of his responsibility and questions whether or not he is worthy, but ultimately thinks being the Ninja is the best thing that ever happened to him.
-   _So_ completely inverted in the "Pandemic" episodes of _South Park_. The boys and Craig experience an end of the world scenario, and then find an ancient prophecy saying that Craig is the chosen one who will save everybody; except Craig's spent the entirety of the two episodes complaining about the whole situation, and stating that he wants nothing to do with any of it. He refuses to explore an ancient ruin in one part, noting that nothing is forcing them to go further in. Subverted when, by walking away from the ancient ruins, Craig inadvertently walks into the episode's villain and steps onto a mystic stone that converts Craig against his wishes into a living laser beam.
-   _Steven Universe_:
    -   The titular character is the son of the late Rose Quartz, leader of the Crystal Gems, and can't wait to be like the other Crystal Gems and help them save the world. Unfortunately, he still doesn't have a very good handle on his powers...and furthermore, he's beginning to realize that there are some serious downsides to the whole 'magical hero' business.
    -   Connie Maheswaran is rather of envious of Steven's "magical destiny" and thinks he'd be disinterested in someone as "normal" as her. She's rather enthralled to be involved in Steven's magical adventures and immediately seconds Steven's suggestion to become Pearl's apprentice in swordsmanship.
        
        **Connie:** Please, I wanna learn! I mean, I don't know what'll happen in the future, but if something dangerous comes along, I don't wanna be a burden, I wanna help! I wanna be there for Steven, to fight by his side! The Earth is my home too, can't I help protect it?
        
-   The Human Bullet in _The Tick_. Alas, he always seems to make the situation worse, despite his noble intentions.
-   _Transformers_:
    -   Sari of _Transformers: Animated_ is remarkably eager to serve as ally to the titular giant alien robots, actively befriending them and trying to sneak aboard their ship within their first meeting. When she discovers that she's half machine, her main concern is more that she wasn't told sooner. When she is barred from a mission after this, she promptly upgrades herself.
    -   Miko from _Transformers: Prime_ follows suit - when she spots Arcee trying to convince Jack to meet the other Autobots, she has no idea why he's hesitating and eggs him on. Much to Arcee's exasperation, being spotted means she has to bring Miko along too.
-   Static in _Young Justice (2010)_ is abducted, placed in a pod, and watches several experienced heroes get thrashed by Black Beetle, and what does he do? Grabs a gun and points it at him. This was before he got his powers.

    Real Life 

-   Project Chanology, Of all things. The self-styled biggest bunch of jerks on the internet organised and took on a more sinister group. There's several other stories of the hive awakening for some cause (of wildly variable benefit or justice) that catches on with them.
-   Charles Darwin jumped at the call when he took the post as the ship's naturalist on board the _HMS Beagle_, a move which eventually resulted in the development and publication of his revolutionary Theory of Natural Selection. (Although he was reluctant to publish his evolutionary theories, when his friends called him to do so, predicting how the world at large would react).
-   Volunteering for the military may or may not be this, because some people join it due to more material reasons, such as healthcare benefits, education, and lack of other job prospects. Applying to enter the special forces, however, isn't so much jumping at the call as it is skydiving at the call straight out of an exploding plane. Which is why in many countries, volunteering for the special forces requires a candidate to be a double or triple volunteer - first, they must volunteer for the infantry or marines, then they must volunteer for paratrooper or diver training, and only then can they volunteer for the special forces.
-   In 1941, Japan was advancing deep into China. Claire Lee Chennault managed to get funding and airplanes for the American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers) from the US Government (which was still neutral at the time) but he needed pilots. So Chennault put the word out that he needed pilots who were interested in leaving the US military and fighting in his and FDR's little mercenary group in China. 100 pilots and 200 ground crew, plus 10 flight instructors joined up. Once the US actually joined the war, Robert Lee Scott of the US Army Air Force was delivering supplies to the AVG when he begged his way out of his obligations and into the Tigers, because he was so excited to get into action.
