_"Stand. Bow. Sit."_

— **The Class Rep**

They're smart, poised, caring, and have a tendency to stick their nose in where no one wants it.

The Class Representative is disturbed by how the lead or their friends don't participate in club activities or how their grades are slipping and never gets the hint that nobody cares about that stuff. Can be The Smart Guy. Usually this character is female.

They frequently admonish the cast for small mistakes, help make up for the Two-Teacher School, and may be in cahoots with the Absurdly Powerful Student Council. An anime example will almost always called "iinchou" ("class rep") or in a classic Latin American Soap Opera example, is always called in Spanish "Jefe(a) de Grupo/Clase" (Group/Class Boss) in place of her real name. In British schools, and in some countries that were part of the empire, these are known as "Prefects". Schools with more than one also tend to have a "Head Boy" and "Head Girl", who are in charge of the rest of them and tend to have a square or shield shaped badge pinned somewhere on their uniform to identify them.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Sometimes they can be an approachable authority when the protagonist gets into a mess, but doesn't want to involve the adults. In this case, expect the protagonist to develop a new respect for the Class Rep.

Over the years, they have become a member of the Unwanted Harem or otherwise as a potential love interest for the hero. The bossy and antagonistic roles these characters often play means that many of them end up as tsunderes as well.

Can initiate a Selective Enforcement plot by catching the small offense. Another recent trend (especially in anime) is for them to be Obsessively Organized, especially in regards to making sure every uniform is _perfectly_ spotless and every classroom _perfectly_ symmetrical.

If the character doesn't represent the class so much as rule it, she's the Academic Alpha Bitch. See also the Student Council President.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _School Days_:
    -   Setsuna Kiyoura is the class rep for her, Makoto and Sekai's class.
    -   Kotonoha Katsura is a member of the school council _and_ her class's representative. It doesn't save her from being horribly bullied, though.
-   Adachi Hana of _Flunk Punk Rumble_ is somewhat of a weird version of this trope. She's a former Yankee, terrible at schoolwork, terrible at everything, and just plain weird. She also rocks the glasses/braids look, because she thinks it automatically makes her the perfect class rep.
-   Hikari Horaki in _Neon Genesis Evangelion_. She also has the honor of being one of the few characters in _Evangelion_ to be anything close to well-adjusted and one of only two characters in the whole series who has siblings (the other being her crush and most frequent target of her wrath).
-   The position of Class Rep is an early bone of contention between the central characters of _His and Her Circumstances_, Arima and Yukino, who later fall in love with each other.
-   Nanami from _We Were There_, although she didn't want the role, sucks at her job _and_ abuses her power.
-   Eri Ninamori from _FLCL_ was a notable subversion. She was the class president (as revealed in episode 3), but she wasn't very upstanding about it, and even abused the power to ensure that she and Naota would be the lead roles in the school play because she liked him. Of course, it's entirely possible that she just sees this sort of thing as normal given that her father, an important local politician, is a serial philanderer and implied to be corrupt in other ways as well.
-   Keiko Yukimura in _YuYu Hakusho_ is mentioned as being this for Yusuke's class. She gets really, really annoyed with Yusuke for skipping school, getting horrible grades, and in general being an ass.
-   Ichijou from _Pani Poni Dash!_ is another subversion. She's the class president, but also a complete Cloudcuckoolander who does all sorts of bizarre things (including flying) with a seemingly casual air.
-   Yukihiro Ayaka from _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ the role really shows with her butting heads with Asuna, usually taking charge of just about any group activity she is present in, and being a total Teacher's Pet (in more ways than one, if she had her way). Word of God says that this trope is the only reason why she can hold a phone conversation with the then The Voiceless Zazie (which her speech bubbles in that consisted of just Visible Silence.) as a "Class Rep must understand her class she represents".
    -   Also, when Yue loses her memory and is enrolled in the Magical Knights Academy, she meets a class representative who starts out as the Alpha Bitch (but soon becomes more friendly)
-   _Gakuen Alice_ has Yuu Tobita, one of the few students that didn't berate Mikan for her weird Alice and late discovery. There are quite a few as the story progresses due to the larger role other characters start to play. There's Tono who is the the representative of the Special Ability Class, though he doesn't fit the mold. There is also Subaru, representative of the Somatic Ability Class, who looks the part but has some touches of childishness at times, mostly around his sister due to sibiling rivalry. In between is the male lead, who represents the entire elementary branch rather than one classroom. His (limited) authority over the kindergarten kids allows him to demonstrate good around children to the female lead.
-   Chiyo in _Azumanga Daioh_, though not the typical one as described above. It's also established that Yukari-sensei has very low standards when it comes to the role - the previous year, she asked for volunteers, waited five seconds, and then pointed at a guy in the front row of desks and said, "Congratulations, you're it!"
-   Twin sisters Ryou and Kyou in _CLANNAD_. But while Kyou volunteered for the role, Ryou got picked via lottery. As a result, she doesn't really have the personality usually associated with the Class Rep.
-   Chiri in _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_ _acts_ like one (specifically being homicidally obsessed with symmetry), even though she's not - as a Running Gag, the actual class representative is almost perpetually unnoticed by the other characters.
-   _Pretty Cure_
    -   Honoka in _Futari wa Pretty Cure_ is apparently supposed to be the class rep, but this doesn't have any visible effect on anything. The only time anything Class Representative\-ish actually happens, it's near the end of _Max Heart_, and it's minor character Seiko that's doing it.
    -   The two class reps in _Futari wa Pretty Cure Splash★Star_ were recurring characters, but again, their representative-ness was never really of any importance.
    -   In _Yes! Pretty Cure 5_, Karen/Cure Aqua is student council president, and her seriousness about the job often puts her at odds with the more carefree Nozomi/Cure Dream.
    -   In _Smile PreCure!_, Irie (Jared for the _Glitter Force_ version) is student council president, and is viewed as one of the most popular boys in school, as well as frequently working with Reika/Cure Beauty.
-   Teshigawara in _First Love Sisters_.
-   Male versions: Kunimitsu Tezuka (who's also Council President) and Syuichirou Oishi in _The Prince of Tennis_. The information coming from artbooks says that Keigo Atobe, Genichirou Sanada and Hiroshi Yagyuu are also members of the student councils in their respective schools.
-   Reika Tamaki in _Ojamajo Doremi_. There's a whole episode dedicated to the Ojamajos aiding Masaharu, a sweet boy who's her rival for the Class Rep elections, and they get so carried away with overthrowing Tamaki that they almost ruin his campaign.
    -   She regains this position some time in _Motto_; by then, she underwent a lot of Character Development and Took a Level in Kindness.
-   Haruka of _My-HiME_ fits the trope description to a T. We only see her as a member of the Absurdly Powerful Student Council, but she's undoubtedly president of whatever class she's in.
    -   Shizuru used to be one before becoming Student Council President, as noted in Natsuki no Prelude. In the manga, Akira is Takumi's class representative.
-   Tomoe from _My-Otome_, the second ranked Coral, introduces herself in episode 2 as the representative for her class.
-   Eimi in _Magical Project S_ parodies this character type. She is obsessed with keeping everybody (even people not part of the school) within the (unusually extensive) school rules at all times, even standing up to Pixy Misa a few times in the process. This just makes it funnier when she gets brainwashed into being a magical girl, then has a breakdown after she's returned to her normal mental state when she finds her gaudy outfit breaks the school rules and she can't de-transform out of it.
-   _Darker than Black_: Subverted: Kanami was implied to be a pretty lax class rep, while Kirihara adopted her authoritative roles.
    
    **_Kanami:_** \[to Alice\] _"If you're smart enough not to get caught, I'm not going to stop you."_
    
-   Fumitsuki Nanakorobi in _Happy Lesson_, although she tends to leave some of the discipline stuff to the teachers. Also has a crush on the main character, and frequently gets upset with him. In the manga version, she gets less upset with the main character, although that's partly because the anime and manga have different main characters (That Other Wiki can explain it better than I can).
-   Nene in _Hyakko_. Torako is shocked to find out she's the class rep, since unlike most of the examples on this page, she doesn't have the glasses indicative of the position.
-   Tomoko Hoshina in _To Heart_. However, she loses the typical bossy class rep attitude in _Remember my Memories_, when she moves to Kobe. Also, Manaka Komaki from _To Heart 2_. Though she's more of a class rep on paper, as she fails to manage the class properly. She's a Hot Librarian though...
-   _My Bride is a Mermaid_'s class rep is more or less an inversion of the usual personality type; she's a Shrinking Violet who blends so far into the background that no one in the class actually knows her name. She does attempt to break out of it at several points, but circumstances conspire against her. Mawari actually fits the personally more closely, despite not really being the class representative.
-   Although _Chrono Crusade_ is set in 1920's America and Rosette doesn't go to a school, there's still a character that falls under this trope. A bonus story in the manga talks about her childhood friendship with a girl name Beth, who is a "monitor" at the Order and has the bossy, rules-obsessed personality that class reps typically have in anime.
-   Haruna in _To Love Ru_. She's representative for a year, then declines to run again. Then Lala and Yui vie for the spot the next year. Haruna wins anyway because no one wants to vote for Lala or Yui. (Yui's a hardass, and Lala has no clue what she's doing.)
-   Sumika Murasame from _Whispered Words_, though not the stereotypical busybody type.
-   You know that one 4chan banner with a distressed girl yelling "No raping in the classroom"? She's class president. The source is a hentai manga called _Anal Justice 2_... which you seriously should not look up.
-   Takako Ayase from _Midori Days_ isn't the formal rep in her class, but she acts like the typical Class Represenative and as a result is looked up to by her classmates more than the actual class rep.
-   Izumi Segawa from _Hayate the Combat Butler_ is happier goofing off with her classmates than bothering with her duties.
-   Teru Mikami of _Death Note_ in his Back Story. He took his role as Class President and protecting his peers very seriously... when no one else did. The result-he comes to see the world in a very black and white perspective and comes to believe that no one else cares about justice as he does... (that is until he becomes The Dragon to his God Kira...)
-   In _Soul Eater_, Spirit recalls with horror that Yumi Azusa used to be the class rep...and is still bossing around her classmates, now fellow staff-members, like naughty schoolchildren. Which, given the Shibusen faculty is probably quite right and necessary for anyone to get anything done, including the headmaster Lord Death.
-   In _Amagami_ there's Ayatsuji Tsukasa who is a very nice person. Turns out it was just a facade; she's actually a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing.
-   Shizuka from _Doki Doki School Hours_.
-   Kaho Hiiragi in _Freezing_.
-   Ayumi Shinozaki of _Corpse Party: Blood Covered_ subverts the usual personality type: she's a Girlish Pigtail\-sporting, cheerful scary story fanatic.
-   In _Lucky Star_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> :
    -   Kagami isn't one by the time the manga starts, but she was head of the first-year reps during _that_ year.
    -   Unsurprisingly, Miyuki was head of the third-year reps _and_ Student Council President during third year.
    -   Misao was the Athletics Rep for her class.
    -   Ayano was on the Discipline Committee.
    -   Kou<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  was the Student Body Treasurer.
    -   Yutaka ran for the position, but didn't get elected.
    -   Minami is on the Health Committee.
    -   None of the listed _sensei_ sponsor any.
-   In _Dear Brother_, Kaoru Orihara aka "Kaoru no kimi" is the class rep for Nanako and the other freshwomen's class. Kaoru is somewhat of a subversion, though: she actually had to be held back a year due to being an ill girl so she didn't get the spot due to grades, and can be very... Hot-Blooded, to say it politely, if she finds out about bullying in class. She still does fill in when it comes to leadership, though.
-   Yukari Sakuragi in _Another_. But she dies VERY early in the story.
-   _Major_ subversion: Rin Kokonoe from _Kodomo No Jikan_ is the class rep.
-   Tabe from _Popcorn Avatar_ is the class rep in Kurando's class.
-   Manami Mitami from _A Centaur's Life_ is a textbook example. She treats her classmates not much different from how she treats her little sisters. Her short introduction in chapter 1 even says she is born for the role.
-   Subverted with Tsukune from _Rosario + Vampire_ who was chosen against his protests, never showed any authority and his position hasn't been mentioned in quite a while.
-   The titular character from _Arisa_. Turns out to be a Broken Ace.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_, Yuma is eventually voted Class Representative because of his popularity from winning duels. This is even though Yuma is very irresponsible and incompetent at anything other than dueling. The Student Council, corrupted by the Barrian World and aided by a jealous Takashi, the former Class Representative, plot Yuma's destruction. Later, after Yumi foils their plot, he gives the position back to Takashi.
-   Completely and utterly mocked in _Urusei Yatsura_. One chapter deals with the election, and ends with Ataru being voted in to stop Mendo from enacting his draconian measures against any male who is late at school, but he's so ineffective that Mendo does the job anyway (as a deputy), and a later chapter reveals that _everyone had forgot Ataru was the representative_.
-   China Kousaka in _Gundam Build Fighters_ has a much smoother relationship with the mostly well-behaved Sei. Which is good, because she has a major crush on him.
-   In _Yowamushi Pedal_, Manami Sangaku's childhood friend Miyahara is the Class Representative for their class, and Sangaku has taken to calling her "Iinchou". She is constantly frustrated and annoyed by Sangaku's tendency to come to school late because he spends his mornings biking in the mountains, and had to intervene for him before to make sure he doesn't repeat a year.
-   Kawai is this in _A Silent Voice_, both in elementary school and high school. For appearances only, at least; her true personality teeters on the edge of Academic Alpha Bitch. Other students seem to have noticed, but wouldn't say it to her face.
-   Masako Negishi from _Komori-san Can't Decline!_. In a variation of the norm, she's rather shy and something of an introvert. Given that her older brother is her homeroom teacher, he might have given her the position specifically to help her break out of her shell.
-   In _ReLIFE_, the boy and girl who score highest on a test are chosen as the class representatives. Kariu had been class rep for three semesters, but for her third year she was in the same class as Hishiro, the top student in the school. Ohga is also chosen as class rep.
-   Aya Kurokawa from _Kanojo Ni Naru Hi Another_ is a particularly tragic example. She's cool, kind, caring and studious but firmly believes she deserves no credit because she's firmly convinced she's nothing more than a Replacement Goldfish for her deceased elder sister. Her parents even made her take the same name, albeit using different characters. Even class gadfly Shima is taken aback by the grief and bitter self-loathing ("the true me is ugly") he finds lurking under her cool and collected Stepford Smiler exterior.
-   Sumire Kakei from _Boruto_ starts out as the class rep of Boruto's academy class. She is a bit shy though. She is the only student to wear a Sailor Fuku. Then in turns out she's a Laser-Guided Tyke-Bomb with touches of Dark Magical Girl, and this position was perfect to earn the trust of her classmates. Just as Planned
-   _My Hero Academia_:
    -   Tenya Iida, who's the class rep for Class 1-A, plays with this trope; he's a male student who, despite being a cartoonishly exaggerated version of the usual rules-obsessed goody-two-shoes, almost misses out on his inevitable role. When it comes time to elect the class rep, almost every student votes for themselves; Iida naturally goes the honorable route and votes for someone else, and he ends up with _zero_ votes. Midoriya and Yaoyorozu are chosen as President and Vice President, but Midoriya steps down and chooses Iida as his replacement (much to Yaoyorozu's despair).
    -   Itsuka Kendo, the class rep for Class 1-B, also plays with the trope. She's friendlier and more tomboyish than most examples, but she still fills the role of keeping her class in line (especially Monoma), to the point that they all view her as a Cool Big Sis.
-   _The Quintessential Quintuplets_: At the beginning of the third year, Yotsuba nominates herself and Fuutarou and representatives for Class 3-1, even though the latter isn't interested in the position. They actually manage to do a pretty good job, especially when it comes to the school festival.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Summer from _School of Rock_. She complains when told that the class no longer has to do any schoolwork.

    Literature 

-   Matsunaga in _Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan_ has the bad luck to be class rep when Dokuro joins the class. As a new student, she's told to sit with him; Dokuro would rather sit with Sakura, so she casually turns Matsunaga into a monkey. He stays this way throughout the series.
-   Seiri Fukiyose from _A Certain Magical Index_ is shown onscreen to admonish delinquent classmates and represent their class in school functions. However, she's not the Class Representative, strictly speaking. The real Class Representative is actually Aogami Pierce, whose carefree mannerisms and perversions make him a complete subversion of this trope.
-   The _Chalet School_ is full of prefects, or "prees", whose duties include demanding fines from the girls for using slang, or speaking the wrong language on the wrong day. Some characters are very unwilling to become prefects, especially Joey herself.
-   Kaname Chidori in _Full Metal Panic!_. She's an absurdly powerful Class Representative, she practically runs class for most of the time.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Hermione Granger is the living, breathing personification of this trope in Western literature (even if she doesn't actually _become_ a Prefect until the fifth book) as she constantly annoys her peers with her knowledge in the beginning and helps them later on.
    -   Ron becomes the other Gryffindor prefect in their year to his shock, but he does not take it nearly as seriously as Hermione (it doesn't help that the two biggest troublemakers that he _should_ be telling off are his older brothers).
    -   Percy Weasley is another example, with the variation of what happens when you take it a little too far...
    -   Draco Malfoy becomes the Slytherin prefect, and naturally starts abusing his authority as often as possible.
    -   Naturally, Fred and George never became prefects, saying it would take all the fun out of life.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_:
    -   To start with, Ryouko Asakura gets this position basically by default, despite there never being an actual vote, by virtue of being the most popular girl in class. She still plays the trope dead straight, though: She's cute, smart, cheerful, caring...she's absolutely perfect!
    -   After Ryouko "suddenly transfers out" (read: gets deleted from existence by Yuki for trying to kill Kyon), none of the rest of the class has any desire to take on the role, leading to an apathetic and unorganized class that ends up doing a survey for the School Festival.
-   Akane Asahina in _Kanokon_. She _tries_ to keep Chizuru's antics under control, but considering she's a normal human, completely unaware of the supernatural around her, it ends up being futile.
-   _Anata o Shinjiteru_, one of the Novelizations of the Dating Sim _Tokimeki Memorial 2_, has Sayo Tsukimura, who's the representative of the same class as the novel's main hero Shunta Torigoe, and main heroine Kaori Yae. She's only obnoxious towards Shunta though, because she's secretly in love with him and thus all Tsundere towards him; with other people, she's well-liked and respected.
-   In _Tantei Team KZ Jiken Note_, Aya becomes one when she enters middle school. Ironically it makes her even more isolated, due to a rumour that the school chooses the student with the best entrance exam score to hold that position.
-   Youko Nakajima in _The Twelve Kingdoms_ starts out as the class rep, although contrary to the trope, she's a very passive figure who goes along with what other people say rather than risk their disapproval. By the time she grows out of that tendency, she's Trapped in Another World.
-   Roald Dahl tells in his autobiography of prefects at his school, or "Boazers" as they were known, who had the power of life and death over younger pupils, including the authority to use Corporal Punishment.
-   _Linked_: Class president Caroline is obsessed with getting her classmates involved in activities and social causes and becomes obsessed with the paper chain project due to how it is finally achieving her wish, raising her social standing, and doing some genuine good.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Liberty Van Zandt in Seasons 1-4 is an ambitious know-it-all student of _Degrassi_. She was responsible for involving the school in putting on a performance of 'Dracula' to express the darkness the school went through. After season four she doesn't so much represent the class as rule it.
-   _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody_'s Cody Martin is the "educationally gifted" character who won the election for 8th grade class president on his academic ideals.
-   Annie Edison started out as this on _Community_, albeit a likable version. She's chilled out a bit over the run of the show, but still shows her type-A tendencies every so often.
-   One season of _Grange Hill_ featured an exploited/invoked version of the trope; the school itself didn't have a prefect system, however (with the help of a badge from another nearby school which does) an older student is able to convince some year sevens (there was a running gag that they had based all their expectations of secondary school on _Harry Potter_) that she is one.

-   In _Gilmore Girls_, Paris Geller, the Academic Alpha Bitch, goes from this to Student Council President.

    Manhua 

-   Hao Xuan from _School Shock_ is an interesting take on the class rep: he's an apathetic, nihilistic guy who's completely aware of that he was only elected to be the class's errand boy and has absolutely no power or influence.

    Video Games 

-   Iinchou (Chairperson) from _Rival Schools_, who is never even given a real name and readily jumps into the brawl and starts _kicking ass_...well, maybe a little. Unless you have Iinchou as your assistant character rather than direct fighter. In that role, she's unstoppable!
-   Luna Platz in _Mega Man Star Force_ focuses her school-spirit efforts on a particularly difficult target: the hero, Geo Stelar. (It takes her half of the first game to get him to attend school at all.) Her cronies Bud and Zack _always_ call her "Prez" (see "iinchou" above); by the second game, Geo and Omega-Xis are doing this too.
    
    In the third game, this is used to Geo's benefit in the postgame quest. Taurus Fire R attempts to impersonate Bud to keep Geo from attacking him by stating he learned about a virus outbreak by Luna. Failing to call her "Prez" confirms Geo's suspicions about his identity.
    
-   Ayumi Shinozaki of _Corpse Party_ has the position, but not the typical personality. She _loves_ to tell scary stories.
-   In the _Yu-Gi-Oh! Tag Force_ games, we have Reika Hara (Bright in the international versions) fill in this role. We don't really see much of this in action, though, but her mannerisms (like being concerned about the Player Character's grades and constant reminding of school duties)make her qualify.
-   Minami Ginjo of _Omega Labyrinth Life_ is this for the protagonist Hinata's class. She is very kind, regal, and generous, acting like an older sister figure, though many of her events does have her struggling with her insecurities, and the stress of _needing_ to be constantly a princess-like figure because of her family's absurdly rich and powerful business conglomerate.
-   According to interviews, Cheren from _Pokémon Black and White_ was designed with this archetype in mind. He's a serious and studious looking teenager.

    Visual Novels 

-   _CLANNAD_: The Fujibayashi twins Kyou and Ryou are the class reps for their respective classes. Ryou is too timid and shy for the position, but she tries nonetheless to convince Tomoya to not get late, even if she doesn't succeed. And if she does succeed, it's because of her horrible fortune telling skills, in which only the opposite comes true. Kyou doesn't have the personality of a honor student, but definitely the bossy attitude of a leader, which makes it difficult for anyone to decline her.
-   _Katawa Shoujo_: Shizune Hakamichi and Lily Satou are both Class Reps. This is especially impressive in Shizune's case since she is both deaf and mute. Lily prefers a more laid back approach from what we have seen while Shizune plays the trope straight. Shizune and Lily both happen to be cousins as well.
-   _Majikoi! Love Me Seriously!_ has two significant characters: 2-F's Token Mini-Moe Mayo, who volunteered for the position when nobody else would come forward, and Hideo, who serves the same role for 2-S. It's not arguable that the latter is slightly better suited for the role, which results in Yamato frequently taking charge of 2-F during activities.
-   _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_: Ishimaru Kiyotaka is such a devoted class rep that it's his "Super High-School Level/Ultimate" talent: the reason he was invited to attend the prestigious Hope's Peak Academy in the first place. Even as their potential school life is replaced by a Deadly Game, Ishimaru does his best to maintain order, even trying to organize morning exercises. The rest of the students don't really take him seriously.
-   _Hatoful Boyfriend_ has Sakuya le Bel Shirogane, who got his position unelected by virtue of having a wealthy family. He's overbearing and condescends even to the teacher, but has no real power and is largely not respected, to his dismay. Still, plop him into a crisis situation like BBL and he's surprisingly proactive and useful.
-   _Muv-Luv_ has Chizuru who fits the stereotype to a T. While the other characters call her normally, the main character always calls her iinchou, much to her annoyance. when the MC travels to the Alternative universe, he keeps this habit even though she's obviously not a class rep anymore. This confuses her to no end and tries to make him stop, though she eventually surrenders.
-   _The Fruit of Grisaia_: Sachi holds this position due to her diligence and always fulfilling orders.

    Webcomics 

-   Alex definitely fits this trope in _The Wotch: Cheer!_

    Web Original 

-   Virtual YouTuber Mito Tsukino of _Nijisanji_ is supposed to be a class representative, but while her profile describes her as one she doesn't really act like it. That hasn't stopped her from being recognised as the VTuber world's "iinchou".

    Western Animation 

-   Jodie from _Daria_ is always trying to get the title character to participate in school activities.
-   Double D, a male example, of _Ed, Edd n Eddy_ became this in season 5. He has a very active school life and leads several clubs, as well as having the highest grades and scolding those who don't take it seriously (like in _Mission Ed-Possible_).
-   Chris Alice in _Growing Up Creepie_ is made of pure, undiluted school spirit.
-   Courtney is probably this on _Total Drama_. Noah actually is (well, class president), and in a subversion so are Geoff and Heather.
-   Protagonist Marinette Dupain-Cheng of _Miraculous Ladybug_. But unlike most tropes where the class rep is usually in their element, only the episode of Marinette’s election, "Darkblade", is her duties as class representative addressed.
    -   Before Marinette, the representative was Chloé Bourgeois, who shamelessly abused the position and still got re-elected for years due anyone interested getting blackmailed or threatened into quitting. She tries to blackmail Marinette too and has Sabrina steal her diary, but it's turned against her when Sabrina's hand gets caught in the trap Marinette put to protect her diary from being stolen and Marinette exposes the trick.
-   Gretchen Grundler of _Recess_ once did everyone's homework expecting that they were going to use it to help themselves learn the material. Another time she ran for class president on her academic ideals and won.
-   Myron of _Wayside_ wants to be the class president; too bad no one else wants him to.
-   In an episode of _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_ there was a class president election. The winner ended up being the student _least_ like this trope, Funny Foreigner Bolbi Stroganovski.

    Real Life 

-   In the US Air Force, it is a standard practice to assign certain airmen to leadership positions in many training environments, particularly during Basic Training. This allows the instructor to delegate responsibility for supervising the minor details of running things, making it a bit less hectic to look after dozens of trainees at the same time. During Basic Training, they are known as "Student Leaders" or "Element Leaders"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . During Technical School, they may be known as "Airman Leaders" or "Ropes"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . During Airman Leadership School, they are known as Class Commanders or Class First Sergeants.
