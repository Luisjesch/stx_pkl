Say hello to Marilyn and her many, many good friends.

_"Men grow cold_  
_As girls grow old_  
_And we all lose our charms in the end_  
_But square-cut or pear-shaped_  
_These rocks don't lose their shape_  
_Diamonds are a girl's best friend"_

When Jewelry is shown in fiction, it's to pretty up a scene. Pretty much like Real Life, since wearing jewelry is almost always to enhance appearance and/or to show off wealth.

Sparkly jewelry also makes a great MacGuffin; a Mineral MacGuffin, even.

Sub Tropes include:

-   Gem-Encrusted (Sticking jewelry on anything it would pretty up)
-   Diamonds in the Buff
-   Distracted by the Luxury (as jewelry is the most common luxury used)
-   Magical Accessory
-   Ring of Power (since rings are jewelry)
-   Power Crystal

A Sister Trope to Pretty in Mink, Gold Makes Everything Shiny, High-Class Gloves, Mineral MacGuffin.

Compare Everything's Better with Sparkles, Pimped-Out Dress, Conspicuous Consumption (which this trope almost always is), and Billionaire Wristband (a Spear Counterpart).

-   Even though she's an army nurse serving during World War I, Golden Eyes of _"Golden Eyes" and Her Hero "Bill"_ gets to wear some serious bling when she's captured by a German officer who tries to get her to fall in love with him by invoking Distracted by the Luxury - not only does she get dolled up in looted French evening wear, she's dripping in gemstones & strings of pearls so that she'll look nice for their Captive Date. When Golden Eyes is rescued by her boyfriend Bill, she sells "every pretty thing, down to the last glitter and glint of gold and diamond," and donates the proceeds to an orphanage.

On another occasion, he bought his girlfriend Sara one earring with an I.O.U (a very tiny one that fit where the earring would go in the box) for the other one when he can afford it. Sara was nonetheless touched by the gesture.

    Films — Animation

-   _Diamonds Are Forever_ and its very sparkly, fetish-laden title sequence.
-   Ginger in _Casino_ loves showing hers off.
-   The ruby slippers in _The Wizard of Oz_ were changed from silver in the book — both shiny.
    -   The change was partly so the slippers would show up better in Technicolor. As a MacGuffin, they need to be clearly visible.
-   In _Batman Forever_, the Riddler and Two-Face are later seen covered in expensive jewelry as they're driving through Gotham following a robbery. Riddler's actually wearing a diamond tiara as he's trying to count money.
-   Downplayed in _The Fly (1986)_: The morning after Seth's fateful teleportation, he and his lover Veronica stroll through a street market. He purchases a simple necklace with a golden, heart-shaped pendant for her, fastens it around her neck, then whispers "Kiss me." She obliges. Earlier in the film it was established that she didn't wear jewelry, but just as she expanded his Limited Wardrobe of five identical suits with the gift of the more casual clothes he is now wearing, he tweaks her look here. Notably, she wears this necklace for all but one of her subsequent scenes (when she wakes up from a Nightmare Sequence).

    Literature 

-   Sisterhood Series by Fern Michaels: Myra Rutledge has a pearl necklace that she tends to play with out of habit. In _Home Free_, she apparently pulled on her necklace too hard, breaking it, causing pearls to spill on the floor, and she had to go shopping for a new necklace chain.

-   In _The Wheel of Time_, bracelets and necklaces are signs of status among ranking Aiel women, not least because they are the standard currency of wagers among the Wise Ones. A heavy load of jewelry gives the message that it was won through extensive, judicious shrewdness in a Proud Warrior Race culture.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_:
    -   Lestat de Lioncourt frequently adorns his fingers with large, ostentatious rings because he enjoys being flashy and flaunting his old world affluence.
    -   "...The Ruthless Pursuit of Blood with All a Child's Demanding": Because Claudia is the daughter of a moneyed vampire couple, she wears an ornate floral-patterned gold headband studded with pearls for her 17th birthday party, and Lestat's gift to her is an emerald necklace that once belonged to a marquis. She's wowed by it, but the chain is too long for her, so Louis assures her that they'll find one in her size.

-   A male example in _SCTV_ with Bobby Bittman, who wears costume rings on each finger (except his thumbs and often his right middle finger) and is virtually never seen with less than 3 or 4 gold necklaces at any given time. To a lesser extent, Sammy Maudlin, host of his own eponymous late-night gabfest, always has a couple of rings on and a necklace or two, though he's nowhere near as glittery as Bittman.
-   Several times in _Sex and the City_, the girls have reacted with near orgasmic glee when given fancy jewelry by their beaus. Miranda being the exception, she's the only one who hates grand romantic gestures.
-   _Wonder Woman_: Wonder Woman wears a gold tiara and gold or silver bracelets. Ooh shiny!

-   _Bejeweled_ is basically this trope.
    -   _Gyromancer_, which was co-developed by the same company and is essentially Bejeweled embedded in a Role-Playing Game, carries the jewel motif over. There's no stated reason in the plot as to why jewels are important in-game, though - they're just pretty.
-   Found all over the place in the _Dark Parables._ Because they're fairy tale princess-related games, there are dozens of sparkly shiny objects in almost every installment, including carriages, scepters, tiaras, and other jewels. There are also Gem-Encrusted everyday items like axes.
